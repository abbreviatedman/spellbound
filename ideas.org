* The Magicians API - An Executable Memoir
Some ideas!

** Getting Started
*** Create test JS Org file that:
- tangles to multiple files
- ...that can be run successfully as code
- can log values from other source blocks (probably using noweb)
*** Create second test JS Org file that:
- can evaluate code in another org file?
- can append when tangling, or tangle to a central org file, or be added to the Library of Babel, like so:
#+begin_src elisp
(org-babel-lob-ingest "[path to file]")
#+end_src

**** Code that doesn't go in the final program.
***** A recursive function?
***** The code for cycling todos?
***** FizzBuzz?
**** Why literate programming.
***** thinking through decisions carefully - have to defend them
***** documentation and source don't go out of sync... they are the same!
***** good for 3 things:
****** literate config files
****** tutorials
****** /possibly/ for executable memoirs
***** simple and relatable code example
***** Literate Programming And ADHD and Emacs
**** A quote from the show that will go in the final program.

**** Directory Structure With readmes for viewing
**** What Platform?
***** GitHub for maximum views
***** GitLab as Intermediate Option
***** Codeberg to be really out there
