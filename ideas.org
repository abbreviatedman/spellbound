* The Magicians API - An Executable Memoir
Some ideas.

** Getting Started
*** Create test JS Org file that:
- tangles to multiple files
- ...that can be run successfully as code
- can log values from other source blocks (probably using noweb)
*** Create second test JS Org file that:
- can evaluate code in another org file?
- can append when tangling, or tangle to a central org file, or be added to the Library of Babel, like so:
#+begin_src elisp
(org-babel-lob-ingest "[path to file]")
#+end_src
