* Spellbound

** A Story In Magical Code

*** What Is "Spellbound"?

Spellbound is a creative non-fiction work mixing memoir, executable code, and a close reading of the TV show The Magicians.

The first chapter is still being worked on, but in the meantime, you can read what I have so far in [[book/readme.org]].
