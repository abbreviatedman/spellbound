# Magicians Quotes

## S01E01

Quentin: I mean, I get it.

Dr. London: Get…?

Quentin: You're a kid, and your whole life's ahead of you, and you have these notions… about what life is… and… what it could be. But eventually you have to let all that go. So that's what I'm… that's what I'm going to do. That's what I'm doing. It's a part of growing up… you know, selling the comic-book collection

---

Quentin: And, honestly, they probably take anyone conscious for philosophy.

Julia: For philosophy, "conscious" is a detriment.

---

Quentin: Am I hallucinating?

Eliot: If you were, how would asking me help?

---

Dean Fogg: Quentin… do you like this place? You have a gut feeling that… it's something special?

Dean Fogg: You want to go back to Columbia? That pointless, miasmic march to death you call life? Family that never calls and friends that don't really get you and feeling alone and wrong until it crushes you?

Quentin: No.

Dean Fogg: Then quit dicking around!

Quentin: Stop it.

Dean Fogg: Do some goddamn magic!

---

Quentin: Was he murdered?

Dean Fogg: Snuck a box of Oreos.

Quentin: Magicians can't eat Oreos?

Dean Fogg: Diabetics can't have Oreos.

---

Quentin: So "be a magician"? Is that illegal or…? Are you guys trying to take over the world or…?

Dean Fogg: This school exists for a single and timeless purpose… to reveal your innate abilities and hone them to the highest degree. Now, what you do with it after that is entirely up to you. If you want to take over the world, we don't teach that, but give it a go.

---

Eliot: We all signed this waiver. I hope you read yours. It says, "Spellwork is not unlikely to murder you, and, if so… well."

---

Margo: It's good to be aware the world is inherently unfair. Act accordingly.

---

Quentin: There's a lot of nothing spells that people don't even know they're doing. You go online, and there's a video of George Bush they keep taking down, and he's drunk, and he's laughing, he's making magic air ripples.

---

Alice: "Contact the other side."

Quentin: The other side? What, like séance shit?

Alice: Summoning, technically, but, yes.

Quentin: Right. Summoning, of course.

Quentin: Yeah, when I'm trying to contact the dead, I like to summon them whenever possible.

---

Quentin: Look, I-I really… I don't want to get kicked out.

Quentin: And I really don't want to be the guy who dies in the first ten minutes of the movie. Because he's like, "You know what? Let's take out the Ouija board. What could possibly go wrong?"

00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,525
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians…

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,001
<i>Quentin Coldwater
for the grad school interview?</i>

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,726
Well, he's dead.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,450
I think he left
something for you.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,763
You may address me as Dean.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,845
Your only job is to pass
the examination before you.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,922
Regrettably, you failed
the written exam.

8
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,246
Do magic!

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,401
Stop it!

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,761
Ah…

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,609
I need you to tell them
they were wrong about me.

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,483
I can do whatever I want to you.

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,366
Awesome.

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,649
You thought the school is the
only place to track the gift?

15
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,882
We've been watching you
for quite a while now.

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,166
What does that mean?

17
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,641
Okay, for some reason you're
involved, so be involved.

18
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,484
It says we need four people.

19
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,722
Look, I gather you guys need
some extra hands or something.

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,290
Let us know
if shit gets exciting.

21
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,808
Quentin Coldwater.

22
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,163
There you are.

23
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,641
Mr. Coldwater.

24
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,641
Quentin.

25
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,207
Quentin?

26
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,361
Quentin!

27
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,082
Describe The Beast
that attacked you.

28
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,481
Uh…

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,564
How did it get in here?

30
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,289
Mr. Coldwater,
what did The Beast say to you?

31
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,643
How did it know your name?

32
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,121
So what is this place exactly,
besides a health hazard?

33
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,682
Time was, the finest meat
packing plant in town.

34
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,491
Yeah, it's a winner.

35
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,080
- Hey, that star on your arm…
- I earned it.

36
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,369
You will too, with effort,
whole sleeve of 'em.

37
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,050
So what does it mean?
Does it mean that…

38
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,202
You ask a lot of questions.

39
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,408
Yeah, I sure do.

40
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,161
Oh, my God, these are real?
Every one of them?

41
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,687
Guys, this is Julia.
Julia, my associates.

42
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,807
Holy shit, it's…

43
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,769
And that is…

44
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,205
I'm sorry,
what's your name, sweetie?

45
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,248
I'm Marina. I'm new.

46
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,971
Yeah, no kidding.
Everything up and running?

47
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,371
Yeah.

48
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,887
Julia, Marina. Grand tour.

49
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,367
Wait, so who were
those people exactly?

50
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,845
You seriously don't know?

51
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,048
What are you even doing here?

52
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,409
I don't know. I'm waiting for
something interesting to happen. You?

53
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,403
Magic is what I'm doing here.

54
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,847
They're hedge witches.
We're hedge witches.

55
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,524
Jesus, how are you even…

56
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,602
Girls, play nice.

57
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,486
So here is where we keep
all our ingredients and such.

58
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,050
Keeps them safe.

59
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,727
- It's a…
- Meat locker, or it was, anyway.

60
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,643
Now it is so well-stocked,

61
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,245
it's like the end
of the rainbow.

62
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,286
After you.

63
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,601
Hey!

64
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,845
Come on, open the door.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,525
Hey!

66
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,329
Hey, don't be an asshole.

67
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,091
Open the door! Dude!

68
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,929
We were frozen.

69
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,964
Some kind of paralysis spell.

70
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,644
Took over the whole room.

71
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,126
Let's just nip
this all in the bud.

72
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,283
I already told you, the Dean
had something in his hand.

73
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,685
I don't know where
it went after that.

74
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,962
You can materialize objects?

75
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,603
I've been doing card
tricks half my life.

76
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,369
<i>I guess some of them
were disappearing.</i>

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
<font color="#0E7521">Ripped & Corrected By mstoll</font>

78
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,691
<i>Quentin…</i>

79
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,561
Take this.

80
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,281
Is he dead?

81
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,571
The Dean?

82
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,121
How did you know that spell?

83
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,170
Look, I know we're not supposed
to fire off battle magic, but…

84
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,486
I mean, come on.

85
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,523
Can we just get out
of this room soon?

86
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,681
Please?

87
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,971
<i>I know you want
to understand what happened.</i>

88
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,485
<i>Here's what I can say.</i>

89
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,849
We live in a world
that is one world among many.

90
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,924
<i>The Beast you saw was
from one such place.</i>

91
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,321
<i>We do not know the exact
nature of this entity,</i>

92
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,490
only that it was
powerful and malevolent.

93
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,289
Stop it!

94
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,362
<i>And we know that it is gone now.</i>

95
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,483
Wards and shields
protect Brakebills.

96
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,770
They are encoded to each authorized
person on campus and no one else.

97
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,251
We are investigating
how this Beast got through

98
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,243
and resetting everyone.

99
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,690
If someone is responsible
for this attack,

100
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,162
rest assured,
they will be expelled.

101
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,168
Classes are canceled tomorrow.

102
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,130
They will resume Wednesday.

103
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,605
There will be a quiz.

104
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,084
Alice.

105
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,366
Okay…

106
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,807
- Um…
- Don't.

107
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,609
Hey, we did that spell.

108
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,409
You don't get to say,
"Don't," okay?

109
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,084
If they find out…

110
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,049
There they are.

111
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,691
- Glad to see you, kid.
- Oh, you poor thing.

112
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,643
- Nurse?
- Are you okay?

113
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,128
No, it's okay, we're just
gonna get you a nice drink.

114
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,885
Jesus, you didn't tell me
you were dangerous.

115
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,243
Damn it.

116
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,765
And damn it.

117
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,403
Pretty sure my boyfriend's starting
to get curious where I am.

118
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,482
Oh, Jesus Christ,
it's cold.

119
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,449
We're stuck, and they're
trying to kill us, so…

120
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,284
They're not trying
to kill us, okay?

121
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,840
These people are not
murderers. Trust me.

122
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,445
How do you know that?

123
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,046
Because, they don't
have the balls for it.

124
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,727
It's like some sort
of hazing ritual, a test.

125
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,087
I'm sick of flunking
tests right now.

126
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,085
I'm gonna figure it out.

127
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,526
Nothing to see,
you louche little degenerates.

128
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,125
<i>Avada Kedavra.</i>

129
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,486
Whatever, Eliot.

130
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,601
Welcome to the Physical
Kids' Cottage.

131
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,444
It's the single best
place on campus

132
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,329
for a number of reasons
that will become clear

133
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,324
as soon as you taste
our signature cocktail.

134
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,765
I've got to…

135
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,365
Try on this dress I have.

136
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,920
It's perfect. It's made
exactly for those assets

137
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,367
you're hiding underneath
that pilgrim tent.

138
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,283
Yes, you must. Trust me.

139
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,521
<i>Après moi.</i>

140
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,161
On purpose?

141
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,527
Like, you guys
cast it, thinking,

142
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,682
"Oh, monster from another world.

143
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,444
"By all means, come on in."

144
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,841
So you messed up.

145
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,570
It's a little bit
bigger than messing up.

146
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,530
Than what? Than whatever blew
up the entire third year class?

147
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,807
There's a bad story
every few years around here.

148
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,166
I'm not sure that's avoidable.

149
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,126
Okay.

150
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,006
And if you confess…

151
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,650
- Then I'm done.
- Yeah.

152
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,050
Argh…

153
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,084
Before I got here,
I was in the hospital.

154
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,891
I have… Or I had…

155
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,089
I don't know, uh, this thing that I
couldn't shake where I felt like

156
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,767
because nothing was ever not gonna
be pointless and empty, then,

157
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,683
Uh, Why go on?

158
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,926
And then I got here, and…

159
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,450
It's amazing I survived
as long as I did

160
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,648
not knowing that
I was a Magician.

161
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,921
I can't go back.

162
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,126
So, okay.

163
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,765
There is a spell, uh, if they question
you, so they can't read your minds.

164
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,649
I'll write it down.

165
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,370
It's bulletproof.

166
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,521
Thank you.

167
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,448
Now, can you just
help me live with myself?

168
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,811
Okay,
I'm gonna tell you something

169
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,087
deep and dark and personal now.

170
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,685
Ready? Good.
I killed someone.

171
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,321
What?

172
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,522
I was 14. He was this…

173
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,527
He beat me up.

174
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,001
So I'm walking on the street
eating a candy bar,

175
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,323
'cause by then I already ate my
feelings at a professional level,

176
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,449
and I saw him crossing over.

177
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,002
And there was this bus coming.

178
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,048
I barely thought the thought.

179
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,481
Barn.

180
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,244
I knew immediately
what I'd done, that it was me.

181
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,322
My nose literally
started bleeding.

182
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,048
Logan Kinear died instantly and I
ruined my favorite button-down.

183
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,925
And that is the story of how I
discovered I was telekinetic.

184
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,809
If you're trying to tell
me that it gets better…

185
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,120
Oh, God, no. No, it doesn't.

186
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,449
I'm trying to tell you,
you are not alone here.

187
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,569
Funny little irony
they don't tell you,

188
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,564
magic doesn't come from talent.

189
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,041
It comes from pain.

190
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,647
So, do you know what it was,
the thing that attacked you?

191
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,366
- No, I have no idea.
- Oh.

192
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,445
I thought you might be familiar

193
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,921
with some pretty crazy shit
since your family.

194
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,008
Yeah, no, my family's not…

195
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,889
- Right.
- Yeah.

196
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,041
I get it.

197
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,602
Mine too.

198
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,001
Pointless and toxic.

199
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,246
I didn't really learn
magic formally as a kid.

200
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,325
I heard you never got invited to
take the Brakebills entrance exam.

201
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,321
How'd you even find it?
You walked right in.

202
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,565
It's not that hard.

203
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,568
We're in the Bermuda Triangle
of upstate New York.

204
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,523
How'd you get through though?

205
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,690
The wards around the school
are fingerprinted.

206
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,921
You're a stranger.

207
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,851
My parents have alumni keys.

208
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,729
Which are supposed to be charmed

209
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,450
with McNaughton's Unstealable.

210
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,045
I stole one.

211
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,121
Hmm.

212
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,281
Um…

213
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,882
I just wanted to go to school.

214
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,885
Why do you care?

215
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,325
Curious.

216
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,521
Just 'cause…

217
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,365
I don't know.

218
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,965
I want to be
your friend, I guess.

219
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,531
I don't feel like you do.

220
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,330
I'm sorry, I should go.
Thank you.

221
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,931
There has to be something here.

222
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,049
Maybe the phone numbers
are, like, a code or…

223
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,650
That's too easy.

224
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,445
Come on.

225
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,441
Chop-chop.

226
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,648
There has to be something.
I mean…

227
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,641
Oh!

228
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,448
Is it…

229
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,170
Dead? Mmm-hmm, yeah.

230
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,969
But it was already dead,
so I don't know.

231
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,485
Oh, my God.

232
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,528
Jesus Christ,
they're gonna kill us.

233
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,483
Why did I sign up for this?
This is…

234
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,011
- Stop it, stop, okay?
- Okay, okay.

235
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,321
It's dead dead now, I think.

236
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,761
I don't know.

237
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,686
Calm down.
Jesus, guys, it's me.

238
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,046
Pete, is that you?

239
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,610
Howdy.

240
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,526
Oh, Pete, that's definitely a good
look for you, an improvement.

241
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,841
Why don't you join us in here?
I think Marina misses you.

242
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,285
Just let us out.

243
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,408
Don't be stupid.
You have to find your way out.

244
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,960
So this is a test, another test.

245
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,690
Look, if you can't
get through this,

246
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,969
you definitely can't deal with
what it takes to do what we do.

247
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,361
Do you want magic or not, Julia?

248
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,204
Did you look everywhere?

249
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,282
Fast, frostbite's gonna set in.

250
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,725
Asshole. Shit.

251
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,961
What did that mean?

252
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,611
Uh, where didn't we look?

253
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,287
Wait.

254
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,849
<i>"Une chaleur temporaire."</i>

255
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,011
Temporary warmth.

256
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,689
I was just researching.

257
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,921
Reading a kids' book?

258
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,161
What do you want from me, huh?

259
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,890
Jesus, we could not
have screwed up

260
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,405
that spell worse,
and we can't take it back,

261
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,249
and you don't even like me.

262
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,446
I don't know you.

263
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,726
I don't know you either,

264
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,009
except that we summoned some kind of
killer mothman from another world.

265
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,491
Yeah, there is that.

266
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,008
You should hate me right now.
I dragged you into this.

267
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,770
It's just you showed up
with that sigil on your hand,

268
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,763
and it was the same one that
was on the book that I needed,

269
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,764
and my brother,
his spirit, I mean,

270
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,842
sent you to help me contact him.

271
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,127
So, I'm not really sure
that that's what happened.

272
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,407
The thing on my hand,
the sigil,

273
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,883
uh, it appeared when
I was dreaming of Fillory.

274
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,805
Okay.

275
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,487
In my dream,
the sigil on my hand,

276
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,040
it came from Jane.

277
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,690
Chatwin. From Fillory.

278
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,331
Look, honestly, Quentin,
growing up,

279
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,880
the last thing I wanted
to do was read fantasy.

280
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,721
Okay. What if, um…

281
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,803
What if Fillory is real?

282
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,530
And I know that you think that
this is just about Charlie,

283
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,489
but I think maybe it's bigger,

284
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,086
because what came through that
mirror instead of Charlie,

285
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,845
it didn't exactly grow up
in the neighborhood.

286
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,411
Okay.

287
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,166
So what if it came from,
like, actual Fillory?

288
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,010
That's a leap, Quentin.

289
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,369
I mean, there are other worlds out
there, but Fillory is just fiction.

290
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,683
Oh, no, the uh,
Chatwins, they're real.

291
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,807
They lived next door
to the author.

292
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,291
He based the characters on them.

293
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,364
Jesus, how do you
not know any of this?

294
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,569
Is there, um, someplace on campus
we can to go to watch a video?

295
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,802
- Yeah.
- Good.

296
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,366
<i>After living next
door to the Chatwins for years</i>

297
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,283
<i>and writing stories
for young Jane and Martin,</i>

298
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,204
<i>when Martin Chatwin disappeared,</i>

299
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,203
<i>Christopher Plover
was devastated.</i>

300
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:19,286
<i>This was just one of a series of painful
events that haunted Christopher Plover.</i>

301
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,647
<i>It suffused his work with a
sense of melancholy and loss.</i>

302
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,123
<i>And the mystery of
Martin Chatwin's disappearance</i>

303
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,123
<i>was never solved.</i>

304
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,801
<i>Even more mysterious,</i>

305
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,405
<i>Martin's sister Jane disappeared</i>

306
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,970
<i>the following year.</i>

307
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,166
That's a lot of disappearing.

308
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,442
Yeah, I mean, that's kind of why
people are obsessed with the books,

309
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,569
'cause you have these kids walking
into clocks, uh, into other worlds,

310
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,801
and they're based on real kids,

311
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,803
and the real kids, uh, vanished.

312
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,564
You're saying that
Charlie vanished too…

313
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,244
No, no, no, no, no.
I don't know.

314
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,810
I don't know what happened
to Charlie or anyone.

315
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,167
I don't, uh, know.

316
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,131
I mean look, we called
something from another world.

317
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,806
I don't know, can that
really be a coincidence?

318
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,405
So what do we do?

319
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,604
Don't get caught.
I can't get kicked out.

320
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,966
I mean, I have to find out
what happened to him.

321
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,010
Yeah, I know, but…

322
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,525
What if Fillory is real?

323
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,923
Jesus, you don't understand how
mind-blowing that is. It's just like…

324
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,604
Do you want to
stay at Brakebills?

325
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,682
- Yes.
- Okay, so do I.

326
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,724
So let's just hide the evidence
and get our story straight.

327
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,847
Okay?

328
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,210
What, you're leaving?

329
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,123
- I'm gone.
- Come on.

330
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,488
Look, I know I don't
know you that well,

331
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,369
but I know you're not
the type to scare easy.

332
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,444
You want the truth? No sweat.

333
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,522
Hearing people's thoughts
is the least of my problems.

334
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,487
Couple lines, right mix of meds.

335
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,164
But you heard Quentin
and Alice in the lab.

336
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,401
No, I didn't.

337
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,165
There's this voice.

338
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,651
Everyone else comes
with a lot of static,

339
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,724
but him, he's clear
as a fucking bell.

340
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,250
Says he's a Magician.
That's…

341
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,043
That's all I know about him.

342
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,408
That and everything that he
taught me is real and it works.

343
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,686
Holy shit.

344
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,003
Let's just say life wasn't
exactly non-stop fun growing up.

345
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,162
That's why I love that voice.

346
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,961
Saved my ass so many times,
he's basically my only friend.

347
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,761
Yeah, right up until
he sent me to a lab to help,

348
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,003
and then that thing
walked in through the mirror.

349
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,686
- You were hearing The Beast?
- I was getting duped.

350
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,003
But, do they know?
I mean, Sunderland, anyone?

351
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,408
No, there's no point now.

352
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,687
But don't… Penny, don't go.

353
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,366
Come on. It's not your fault.

354
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,726
He tricked you.

355
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,041
Come on, don't be stupid.

356
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,202
Why would you leave
the only place with experts

357
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,805
that might actually
be able to help you with this?

358
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,206
Why do you care?

359
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,806
Look, I did
the spell too, Penny.

360
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,724
If you're guilty, I'm guilty.

361
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,961
You're guilty.

362
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,880
Okay, great,
let's jump off a bridge.

363
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,007
Kady.

364
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,926
I can't stand it.

365
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,367
Okay.

366
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,281
Go.

367
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,006
But…

368
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,971
Hey, since you're out anyway,

369
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,527
come do something stupid
with me before you go.

370
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,766
Come on.

371
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,688
Yeah, 'cause crushed rocks,

372
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,082
you see that in spells that have
a concentrated area of effect.

373
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,049
I'm sorry, you knew this and you
didn't want to say anything?

374
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,565
Okay, well,
I don't know what I know.

375
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,123
Years reading Internet crap and
accidentally poisoning myself twice,

376
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,561
and now I'm stuck
in a freezer with some bitch.

377
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,721
Well, you are.

378
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,043
What, did you figure you wanted
magic at your blow dry last week?

379
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,690
This is serious for some of us.

380
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,366
Okay, you know what? I'm not
interested in your personal issues.

381
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,603
Hey.

382
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,286
There was sand
in that paint can.

383
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,048
Yeah, and I'm gonna
need a knife and a bowl.

384
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,963
Okay.

385
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,804
And…

386
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,771
<i>"Graisse de l'animal…
De préférence de mouton."</i>

387
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,888
Animal fat. Mutton.

388
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,291
Maybe there's meat?

389
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,521
Come on, let's go before
we freeze our tits off.

390
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,484
This isn’t just some
lark to me, so you know.

391
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,564
No offense, okay, you just smell
a little Ivy League to me.

392
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,723
Yeah, well, it's 'cause I am.

393
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,609
I was.

394
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,250
Have you ever
heard of Brakebills?

395
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,169
Well, it's like this
secret Yale, but for magic.

396
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,241
What?

397
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,845
And you have to be able
to do magic to even get in.

398
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,365
Well, I can do magic.

399
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,090
Yeah, so can I.

400
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,440
And yet, somehow,
I flunked the entrance exam.

401
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,449
That doesn't seem right.
Either you can or you can't.

402
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,690
No, it's not right, and yet
they just left me behind.

403
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,683
I mean, seriously,
what do they expect, you know?

404
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,889
Magic is real and that's the thing,
and once you know that, you can't…

405
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,450
Nothing else matters.

406
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,803
Exactly.

407
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,927
It's like…

408
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,161
I know it's there.

409
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,687
It's everywhere, all around me,

410
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:43,209
a whole world
of power and beauty.

411
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,686
You can't unsee it.

412
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,851
You wake up for the first time.

413
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,001
Yeah.

414
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,327
Who are we kidding?

415
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,971
There's no meat in here.
We've checked everything.

416
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,525
No, no way, I cannot do that.

417
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,080
Mmm-mmm.
No, please do that.

418
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,651
<i>I let my old life
tie me to the tracks</i>

419
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,451
<i>I heard my best friend tell me</i>

420
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,966
<i>You can never go back</i>

421
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,764
<i>I spent my long years</i>

422
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,969
<i>Learning to get out of the way</i>

423
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,451
<i>I have been taught
to turn the other cheek</i>

424
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,969
<i>I get my back stabbed, buddy
to the end of the week</i>

425
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,201
<i>I only try to make it
to the end of the day</i>

426
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,966
<i>I've seen it break
so many before</i>

427
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,886
<i>I don't wanna stick
around here and watch anymore</i>

428
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,041
- Mmm.
- Oh…

429
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,088
Yo, this one looks bunk.

430
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,288
Well, it's not.
It's Emerson's Alloy.

431
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,249
Uh, alloy's rusting.

432
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,406
How do you know?

433
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,760
'Cause I know things.

434
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,888
Like this place…
What? It's a gold mine.

435
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,645
Look, you can't
run away from you.

436
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,645
And, well, I'm here,
and I'm amazing, so I mean…

437
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,925
I'll take it under
advisement, okay?

438
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,570
Hey.

439
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,244
No, leave us alone.

440
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,163
Gladly, we've got
to discuss, um…

441
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,246
There you are, Quentin and
Alice, and Penny and Kady.

442
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,402
You're exactly who
I was looking for.

443
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,684
I found the most interesting
thing buried in our woods.

444
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,081
Follow me.

445
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,162
We never got near
the mirror, I swear.

446
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,681
We were studying, that's all.

447
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,762
What language even is this?

448
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,050
Yes, I mean, sure, I touched it.

449
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,282
We all touched it.
I mean, I touched…

450
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,170
We were studying, so…

451
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,210
Look, I'm just trying
to make sense of this.

452
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,123
There's residue
all over this book,

453
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,487
including a summoning

454
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,562
we believe opened
the door to The Beast.

455
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,483
What did you say?

456
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,681
Nothing, I…

457
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,646
Don't look at me.

458
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,480
Look, I know
they're your friends.

459
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,123
Okay, at this point, I just have
to assume it was all of you.

460
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,168
Yeah, well, it wasn't.

461
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,289
Shut up and I'll
tell you, happily.

462
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,561
It's fine, let's go.

463
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,046
You're welcome, by the way.

464
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,206
What does that mean?

465
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,403
Quentin, can I see you, please?

466
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,845
Alice, you're free to go.

467
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,764
There's nothing I
can do in this moment

468
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,047
to stop the comet from crashing
into the earth, is there?

469
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,201
Hold On.

470
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,887
Uh…

471
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,047
What is this?

472
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,124
My books. I'm headed to return them.
You've heard, I assume.

473
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,964
Word travels fast
when your life's over.

474
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,246
Don't say that.

475
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,045
They're bringing
in a specialist.

476
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,442
Yeah, thanks. Ominous.

477
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,851
I'm sorry.

478
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,850
I don't know, I keep trying to tell
myself this is somehow better,

479
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,809
you know, not to know.

480
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,444
'Cause who would want
to know that magic exists

481
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,965
if there's nothing you can do
about it, you know,

482
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,804
if there's no one
to teach you or help you.

483
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,406
I don't know what to say.

484
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,051
Of course you don't, because
nobody would rather not know.

485
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,686
You don't see color and want
to go back to black and white.

486
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,281
You do not have to make
me feel better really,

487
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,600
we basically
just met each other.

488
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,729
Well, I bond fast.
Time is an illusion.

489
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,963
Look, don't go out
there and be the old you.

490
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,804
How, Eliot?

491
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,484
I go back there, and I'm…

492
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,170
I'm a depressed super nerd.

493
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,483
How about I find you,
and I don't say magic is real,

494
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,490
but I do seduce you,
and so lift your spirits

495
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,769
that life retains
its sparkle for decades.

496
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,609
Yeah, that sounds nice.
Thank you.

497
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,886
Okay.

498
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,284
Is there any way
not to get wiped?

499
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,169
I don't know.

500
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,050
I've heard of the specialist,
and all I can say is,

501
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,451
I hear they're very good.

502
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,850
<i>This is
Julia, little busy. Leave a message.</i>

503
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,287
Hey, it's Q.

504
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,567
<i>Look, I know when
we last met that, uh…</i>

505
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,521
<i>I'm sorry, Jules. I am.</i>

506
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,400
<i>I didn't know what it
must be like for you,</i>

507
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:42,327
<i>and I, um, I hope that
you are doing better.</i>

508
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,284
Oh, my God,
you're just going for it.

509
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,690
So, I got expelled, and they
are sending in a specialist

510
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:57,608
because the local brain wipe
guy is dead, and long story.

511
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,011
<i>Um…</i>

512
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,402
So if you remember or you figured
out why it didn't work on you,

513
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,084
I'd like to know that,
about now,

514
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,562
<i>because I need you to remind
me that magic is real.</i>

515
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,606
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

516
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,206
You know, without Brakebills,
it's just…

517
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,487
I'm lost and you're not.

518
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,730
Magic.

519
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,609
Okay.

520
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,682
Let's find a way
out of this shit hole.

521
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,446
You can't help and
I can't help you,

522
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,443
and it's just…

523
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,410
<i>To send
your message, press one.</i>

524
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,528
<i>To erase, press two.</i>

525
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,720
<i>Deleted.</i>

526
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,361
Hey!

527
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,921
You little piece of shit.

528
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,764
- You ratted me out.
- I told the truth.

529
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,330
- Not all of it.
- Oh, am I a fool?

530
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,845
Apparently not.

531
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,161
- Get off!
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

532
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,125
What the hell was that,
you maniac?

533
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,885
Hey! Step back, both of you!
Who shot off that spell?

534
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,803
- He did!
- I did.

535
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,291
Infirmary, both of you, now.

536
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,683
Figured it out.

537
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,287
The spell, or, you know, the whole
point, that there isn't one.

538
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,604
Not to get out of the room, not
to keep the door locked, nada.

539
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,170
Cute, Pete.

540
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,449
Oh, and scissors make a shitty
screwdriver, by the way.

541
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,601
Good for you.

542
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,887
Now you get why it
was so important.

543
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,883
Uh, to almost die for no reason?

544
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,362
To figure out that not
everything gets solved by magic.

545
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,363
Key fact if you
want to last the month.

546
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,568
You're not still debating letting
me into your club, are you?

547
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,722
Hey, I invited you.

548
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,521
No, you attacked me in a bar,
in a bathroom, on my birthday.

549
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,409
I'm done trying
to prove myself to you.

550
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,766
You weren't.

551
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,487
You were trying
to prove yourself to me.

552
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,609
That means level 50.

553
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,601
Um…

554
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,641
Uh…

555
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,802
Wait, so you were…

556
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,690
Top bitch in New York,
for starters.

557
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,444
Um, and this was…

558
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,046
Me discovering
how much I like you.

559
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,886
You are smart. You're passionate.
You question things.

560
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,450
You messed with my head!

561
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,045
Think about how much you
learned about how to do that

562
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,003
for when you're level 50.

563
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,408
- Hey, don't be mad.
- Don't be mad.

564
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,050
How am I supposed to trust you?

565
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,770
Why would you ever trust anyone?

566
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,889
I am willing to teach the right
people everything I know,

567
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,287
and I know a lot,

568
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,921
because I have certain
connections in certain places,

569
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,288
just like,
for instance, Brakebills.

570
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,764
Brakebills.

571
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,047
- You want a drink?
- Let's get a drink.

572
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,045
Might burn a little.

573
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,329
This is why you're not supposed to
throw this kind of magic around.

574
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,243
If you’re lucky, I can fix this.

575
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,731
You're lucky
you're not expelled.

576
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,648
That's actually…

577
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,921
Hold still, please.

578
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,729
- Pussy.
- Nobody asked you.

579
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,406
Me, the guy you
threw battle magic at?

580
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,170
Hey, have you heard of karma?

581
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,527
Well, sometimes it's instant.

582
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,364
You're welcome.

583
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,011
What is that? How did you…

584
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,764
Real Magicians
protect themselves.

585
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,960
Would somebody please
sign him out of here?

586
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,201
She's late.

587
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,520
She's coming.

588
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,604
Or she's just
done with your shit.

589
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,250
She doesn't have the option.

590
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,601
Finally.

591
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,041
Hey, look, that thing you wanted,
that charm or crystal or whatever?

592
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,963
The Emerson's Alloy Repellant?

593
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,371
Yeah, this guy I was with,
he grabbed it.

594
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,006
Look, I'll find you
another one, okay?

595
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,889
And more.

596
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,042
Here.

597
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,451
There's a ton
of good shit in there.

598
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,921
Listen to all that backpedaling.

599
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,968
I'll get it, okay?

600
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,522
Whatever you want.
I'll find you another one.

601
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,251
Great. You're
a sweet girl, Kady.

602
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,049
You're a heartless bitch.

603
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:31,203
I'm generous with you,
considering.

604
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,846
Get me everything on
this list, this week.

605
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,369
Thanks so much.

606
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,930
You better get back to bed, hon.

607
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,331
I'm sure you got
class in the morning.

608
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,203
- Hi.
- Oh…

609
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,126
Caught me where I'm not meant
to be, a terminal snooper.

610
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,966
How are you, Quentin?
I heard about the attack.

611
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,125
You were there the day
of the alumni interview.

612
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,725
You were a paramedic.

613
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,330
Call me Eliza.

614
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,562
I was there that day to make
sure that you got here.

615
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,281
Oh…

616
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,331
Well, uh, thank you,

617
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,404
but I kind of screwed that up.

618
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,001
Uh…

619
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,884
They're calling in a specialist.

620
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,760
He's supposed to, um, wipe it all
away like it never happened.

621
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,490
Mmm. That sounds…

622
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,490
Hmm…

623
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,411
You know,
I'm the specialist? Sorry.

624
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,531
Shall we sit?

625
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,011
Okay. Okay.

626
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,286
Okay.

627
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,530
Um, just before, um, can I…

628
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,883
Um, why did you
give me that book?

629
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,009
<i>Fillory and Further</i>, book six.

630
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,841
I thought you'd appreciate it.

631
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,251
I lost it.

632
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,560
Guess I was wrong.

633
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,642
No, you're not, I…

634
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,485
I need to read it.
I just, I can't find it.

635
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,608
Things with Fillory
are funny that way.

636
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,485
Is Fillory real?

637
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,211
Why even ask if you'll
just forget it again?

638
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,645
The books, they're just…

639
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,361
They always felt
realer than anything.

640
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,565
Then it's real.

641
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,404
That's not a real answer.

642
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,641
Shall we begin?

643
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,127
Okay, do it.

644
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,369
Oh, Quentin,
I am pleased!

645
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,241
What? Why?

646
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,800
You're a much better liar
than I expected you to be.

647
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,971
Can I level with you?

648
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,530
I wish you would.

649
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,443
You're not very remarkable.

650
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,929
You're smart, but no genius.

651
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,287
You do magic,
but nothing special.

652
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,766
And the worst is,
you're so eager to belong,

653
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,410
you even forget why you're here.

654
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,766
Why am I here?

655
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,363
You dreamed of it, didn't you?

656
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:47,082
Fillory, before the attack,
like a warning?

657
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,964
Yeah, how did you…

658
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,530
Because I've dreamed of it too.

659
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,126
And I've looked
into that Beast's eyes.

660
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,361
What?

661
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,049
Do you think you have a destiny?

662
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,971
Um, yes.

663
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,530
Yeah.

664
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,807
I used to believe that
crap too when I was young.

665
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,249
There is no destiny,
no born heroes.

666
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,207
I can't tell you why The Beast
came sniffing for you.

667
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,929
There's no reason
it should be you.

668
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,168
You can either step up
to it or not, it's up to you.

669
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,288
We'll just hope for the best.

670
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,526
Who are you?

671
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:31,889
Just another inadequate
Magician who's lost people.

672
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,370
So will you if you
don't get strong.

673
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,250
Learn fast, any means necessary.

674
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,408
Which is why I'm so pleased
to see you sitting there

675
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,721
like you don't have
an Emerson's in your pocket

676
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,842
to repel any spell
to wipe your mind.

677
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,285
Uh, you stole that.

678
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,691
Who stole it?

679
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,483
Relax, nobody's
taking your mind today.

680
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,841
We'll make something of you yet.

681
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,163
I'll tell the school
one more chance, probation.

682
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,765
They'll respect my call.

683
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,890
Don't make me regret it.

684
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:09,851
Don't hop back on the garden
path like some little lemming,

685
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,207
or I'll erase everything
and start you over entirely,

686
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,691
for your own good.

687
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,091
The garden path?

688
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,607
Everything's connected.
Don't over-think it.

689
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,770
<i>All of Bobby's flowers

690

691
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,207
Congratulations, Julia.
Big day.

692
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,762
First star. First of many.

693
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,205
Yeah.

694
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,651
<i>Bobby put the flowers in his mama's car</i>

695
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,404
This is just the beginning.

696
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:12,922
<i>And he knew that they
wouldn't have to drive too far</i>

697
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,570
Hope your bits are covered.

698
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,681
Coming in.

699
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,245
How are you, Henry?

700
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,361
I'm sorry.

701
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,647
I knew he'd come, but I swear
I didn't know so soon.

702
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,051
No one is ready.

703
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,724
We need more time,

704
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,530
and a teacher with
full use of his hands.

705
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,761
There's that new wrinkle.

706
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,045
I'll find a way to help you.

707
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,801
We'll heal your
hands and your eyes.

708
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,406
It wouldn't help us. It
wouldn't help them, would it?

709
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,002
This is your problem,
that you should solve!

710
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,565
Quentin, Penny,
they're not built for this.

711
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,563
I know, and I've tried.

712
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,846
Go back there.

713
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,729
You say that like
I could hop a bus.

714
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,802
Find a way back.

715
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,486
Find The Beast. Kill him.

716
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,524
If I could manage that,
we'd be sharing a drink right now,

717
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,807
not a care in the world
and four good eyes between us.

718
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,968
I'm sorry.

719
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,042
Just tell me what else I can do.

720
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,767
All we can do is
make them Magicians.

721
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,365
That's not enough.

722
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,930
I know.

723
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,125
Gonna just keep this
BBQ poppin', my love.

724
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,601
Quentin!

725
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,006
- Get over here.
- Quentin.

726
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,128
- Come on!
- Come on!

727
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,124
Join the party, sad sack.
Hurry up.

728
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:35,761
Oh, my God, it's not
like we have all day.

729
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,127
- We're so drunk.
- Okay, we have all day.

Tell them to test me again.

I'm sorry, but they would know.

It's really okay

15
00:00:23,951 --> 00:00:25,865

- Top bitch in New York.

16

- And who's Charlie?
- My brother. He died.

Jesus, we could not have

20

Just don't get too excited.

24
00:01:05,343 --> 00:01:07,457
Start slow.

25
00:01:07,542 --> 00:01:10,371
Yeah, I don't really do slow.

26
00:01:10,457 --> 00:01:11,788
Hmm…

27
00:01:20,618 --> 00:01:22,947

<i>in part,</i>

29
00:01:24,783 --> 00:01:28,943
<i>about accruing power.</i>

30
00:01:29,029 --> 00:01:31,442
Power over yourself,

31
00:01:31,527 --> 00:01:33,108
the elements.

32
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:35,191
- Power over the future.
- He's back.

He said he had an announcement.

35

But power, as you all know,

36
00:01:43,154 --> 00:01:44,769
does not come cheaply.

37
00:01:46,436 --> 00:01:50,148
<i>There are reasons</i>

<i>There are certain energies,</i>
<i>certain spells,</i>

44

<i>which are far too powerful</i>
<i>for one magician alone.</i>

45

If you lose control,
they will turn against you.

46
00:02:13,387 --> 00:02:16,965

They will consume you.

47

49

Your area of concentration.

It is what you are,

53
00:02:49,815 --> 00:02:51,395
and with the right guidance,

54
00:02:51,447 --> 00:02:53,061
you may safely rise

55
00:02:53,146 --> 00:02:55,942
to unknowable heights.

56
00:02:56,028 --> 00:02:57,641

66
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,285
Better than money.

67
00:03:35,371 --> 00:03:38,200
Better than sex.

68
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:39,949
Well, I guess that one depends.

69

Got it covered, okay.

78

79
00:04:04,686 --> 00:04:07,016
Just saying.

80
00:04:07,102 --> 00:04:09,565
Yes, these are promising.

81
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,731
I get a strong sense of blues

82
00:04:11,815 --> 00:04:15,011
and…and pinks.

83
00:04:15,063 --> 00:04:16,760
Is that Alice Quinn?

84
00:04:16,845 --> 00:04:19,925
Alice, please sit,
if there's a seat.

85
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,557
Bit of a transition.

86
00:04:21,642 --> 00:04:23,757
I find that I prefer an office
that I can reach

87

three flights of steps

88
00:04:25,674 --> 00:04:26,838

This'll be quick, Alice.

90
00:04:28,805 --> 00:04:30,885
Show Professor March
what you can do.

91
00:04:35,585 --> 00:04:37,332
Like I said, I used to do
a lot of coin and card tricks,

92
00:04:37,384 --> 00:04:38,714
and I guess sometimes

93
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:40,163
I, like, actually used
real magic.

94
00:04:40,248 --> 00:04:42,495
Predictions could mean psychic.

95
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,210
Vanishing could mean illusions
or physical magic.

96
00:04:45,296 --> 00:04:47,158
Curious.

97
00:04:47,243 --> 00:04:48,375
What? What's curious?

98
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,540

- Hm.

104
00:05:02,618 --> 00:05:04,148
Definitely.

105

Yeah, Sunderland said
it happens,

Hey, what about
your light-bendy thing?

138
00:06:47,922 --> 00:06:51,252
Like…yeah, we could use,
like, a magnifying glass.

139
00:06:51,337 --> 00:06:54,799

I'm starving.

You and your first year boys.

152
00:08:06,758 --> 00:08:09,454
What is your obsession
with the flavor of the month?

153
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,538
Oh, come on.

154
00:08:11,623 --> 00:08:14,868
He's a high-strung super nerd.

155
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,418
We love those.

156
00:08:21,033 --> 00:08:24,580
I'm not an experienced
drinker, Quentin.

157
00:08:24,664 --> 00:08:27,778
I couldn't tell.

158
00:08:27,862 --> 00:08:29,692
You know, it should have worked.

159
00:08:30,945 --> 00:08:33,574
That spell we did
to reach my brother.

160
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:37,105
I mean, I went over it,
like, a million times.

161
00:08:37,191 --> 00:08:40,020
Should have?
You saying that like you…

162
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:42,019
wanna do it again.

163
00:08:42,071 --> 00:08:44,184
Wait, you don't wanna
try it again, do you?

164
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:47,182
I need to know the truth,
that's all.

165
00:08:47,267 --> 00:08:50,847
You know, the spell
we did was, like…

166
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:52,845
I don't know,
it was like a phone call.

167
00:08:52,931 --> 00:08:55,893
We made contact,
but he didn't pick up,

168
00:08:55,979 --> 00:08:58,092
so then The Beast picked up.

169
00:08:58,178 --> 00:08:59,342
But that still leaves
the question,

170
00:08:59,427 --> 00:09:01,391
"Where's Charlie?"

171
00:09:01,476 --> 00:09:04,721
Well, the last time we asked
that question, somebody died.

172
00:09:04,807 --> 00:09:06,004
Never mind.

173
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:07,837
What do you care?

174
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:10,552
No.

175
00:09:10,637 --> 00:09:12,551
I do. I care.
I wanna help.

176
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:15,665
I just--I don't--

177
00:09:19,715 --> 00:09:20,912
Ooh, oh. Yeah.

178
00:09:20,997 --> 00:09:22,378
Um…

179
00:09:22,463 --> 00:09:25,875
have you read Teukolsky yet?

180
00:09:25,961 --> 00:09:27,742
Uh, so apparently

181
00:09:27,827 --> 00:09:30,040
you can find deceased spirits

182
00:09:30,126 --> 00:09:31,822
with a simple locator spell.

183
00:09:31,874 --> 00:09:33,489
If they wanna be found.

184
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:36,236
That's stupid.

185
00:09:36,322 --> 00:09:39,284
You're stupid.
You have a stupid face.

186
00:09:41,152 --> 00:09:44,365
Uh, anyone have a match?

187
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,646
Uh, it's not working.

188
00:09:46,698 --> 00:09:48,645
Just keep walking.

189
00:09:51,645 --> 00:09:55,308
Okay.
Finally.

190
00:09:56,975 --> 00:09:58,856
Guess it's Woof Fountain.

191
00:09:58,942 --> 00:10:01,971
Ugh. I never liked
this thing.

192
00:10:02,023 --> 00:10:04,686
Eliot says
it's enchanted as shit.

193
00:10:06,104 --> 00:10:09,016
Supposedly it's bottomless,

194
00:10:09,102 --> 00:10:10,383
so you know
the psychics love it.

195
00:10:10,469 --> 00:10:11,965
Suicide fountain.

196
00:10:12,017 --> 00:10:14,846
You don't think
your brother--

197
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:16,596
No.

198
00:10:16,631 --> 00:10:17,928
He wasn't that kinda guy.

199
00:10:17,963 --> 00:10:20,127
He was the kinda guy
who always wanted

200
00:10:20,129 --> 00:10:23,624
to fix things
for everyone around him.

201
00:10:23,626 --> 00:10:26,589
He was really, really good.

202
00:10:26,674 --> 00:10:28,421
You know that spell I did
on the first day of class?

203
00:10:28,507 --> 00:10:30,455
The Glass Horse?

204
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,953
He taught me that.

205
00:10:46,163 --> 00:10:49,076
Come on, let's go.
Nothing's happening.

206
00:11:10,123 --> 00:11:11,827
The whole thing is fucking pointless.

207
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:13,397
Psychic?

208
00:11:13,483 --> 00:11:15,229
I wanna punch Sunderland
in the throat.

209
00:11:15,315 --> 00:11:16,895
You know, as a psychic,
you'd think

210
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,594
- you'd have seen all this coming.
- Oh, woman, please.

211
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,260
Ah!

212
00:11:22,143 --> 00:11:23,757
Hold on.

213
00:11:27,091 --> 00:11:28,387
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa whoa.

214
00:11:28,473 --> 00:11:29,752
Are we actually
doing this again?

215
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:31,114
Do you know how
to close your mind?

216
00:11:31,171 --> 00:11:32,919
'Cause I will show you
right now.

217
00:11:33,004 --> 00:11:34,551
I thought I was.
Eliot gave me a--

218
00:11:34,636 --> 00:11:36,051
Seriously, man?

219
00:11:36,136 --> 00:11:37,916
Taylor Swift?

220
00:11:38,051 --> 00:11:39,964
I am not singing Taylor Swift

221
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,831
in my head.

222
00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:48,742
Okay, I'll work on it.

223
00:11:48,828 --> 00:11:50,574
Jeez.

224
00:11:56,572 --> 00:12:00,036
So, it's got lots of space.
Lots of light.

225
00:12:00,121 --> 00:12:03,567
It looks really great.

226
00:12:03,702 --> 00:12:05,615
I'm sorry, I guess
I thought you were still

227
00:12:05,734 --> 00:12:08,231
considering Yale
for the fall with me.

228
00:12:08,316 --> 00:12:09,563
What?

229
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:12,611
Okay, can we just
talk about this now?

230
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,061
Where is your head?

231
00:12:14,195 --> 00:12:16,558
Why do I feel like
I'm talking to myself?

232
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,190
I'm--I've just been busy
with class--

233
00:12:19,276 --> 00:12:20,475
Are you seeing someone else?

234
00:12:20,526 --> 00:12:22,389
No! Why would you
ask that?

235
00:12:22,474 --> 00:12:24,105
Because you're different.

236
00:12:24,224 --> 00:12:26,553
You stand me up.
You don't answer your phone.

237
00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:29,052
I'm just--I'm starting
to feel like the asshole.

238
00:12:29,187 --> 00:12:31,550
You're not.

239
00:12:33,135 --> 00:12:35,848
Hey…

240
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:37,880
I love you.

241
00:12:38,016 --> 00:12:40,878
You know that.

242
00:12:40,963 --> 00:12:42,877
Look, I know
I've been moody lately,

243
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,043
but…

244
00:12:44,178 --> 00:12:47,091
I feel a lot better.

245
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:49,873
James, come on.

246
00:12:52,374 --> 00:12:54,254
Hey.

247
00:12:56,004 --> 00:12:57,534
Mm.

248
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:00,083
Okay, go on.

249
00:13:00,202 --> 00:13:01,499
Someone killed themselves
in the fountain?

250
00:13:01,584 --> 00:13:03,531
Try 15 students and one dean.

251
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:06,863
Van Pelt.
Fountain's named after him.

252
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:10,743
It does feel a little bit off
here though, doesn't it?

253
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:16,856
Brief announcement.

254
00:13:16,992 --> 00:13:20,854
The Van Pelt fountain is
temporarily off limits.

255
00:13:20,939 --> 00:13:22,354
There's been an incursion.

256
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:29,016
We believe it's
a garden variety haunting.

257
00:13:29,151 --> 00:13:32,514
Redrawing the wards
may have released it

258
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,013
much like a mouse caught
in the walls of a building.

259
00:13:35,098 --> 00:13:36,345
Help!

260
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,843
No one was seriously hurt.

261
00:13:38,928 --> 00:13:40,976
Both students involved
are recuperating

262
00:13:41,061 --> 00:13:43,175
in the infirmary.

263
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:44,889
Regardless,

264
00:13:45,008 --> 00:13:48,755
stay away until we lock it down.

265
00:13:50,005 --> 00:13:51,836
Ow. I mean,
what if it was Charlie?

266
00:13:51,921 --> 00:13:54,051
I don't know.
Maybe.

267
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:57,666
If not, it's
a pretty big coincidence.

268
00:13:57,751 --> 00:13:58,998
But if it was Charlie,
don't you think

269
00:13:59,133 --> 00:14:00,331
that he would have
reached out to you

270
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:01,712
directly…

271
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,543
Maybe he just did.

272
00:14:13,107 --> 00:14:14,547
It's definitely Charlie.

273
00:14:16,005 --> 00:14:17,386
Okay.

274
00:14:20,469 --> 00:14:22,582
So, why would he try
and drown a bunch of psychics.

275
00:14:22,717 --> 00:14:25,414
Uh, have you met them?

276
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:28,379
Are you two talking about
what happened at Woof?

277
00:14:28,464 --> 00:14:31,294
I--that was
a private conversation.

278
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,242
= You know.
Well, meow.

279
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,455
What was that?

280
00:14:39,574 --> 00:14:41,903
I just--I don't trust her.

281
00:14:41,989 --> 00:14:44,902
Okay, look.
I just--

282
00:14:44,988 --> 00:14:47,567
I think trying to drown people
seems a little violent.

283
00:14:47,702 --> 00:14:49,460
He may not have even
known what he was doing.

284
00:14:49,535 --> 00:14:51,698
I mean, spirits,
they can get confused.

285
00:14:51,784 --> 00:14:53,102
Okay, then how do we talk to him

286
00:14:53,149 --> 00:14:56,229
without him trying to drown us?

287
00:14:56,314 --> 00:14:59,227
I don't know.

288
00:14:59,363 --> 00:15:01,225
But first thing's first.
I found a spell--

289
00:15:01,361 --> 00:15:03,225
well, five actually, but they
all have their own down side.

290
00:15:03,311 --> 00:15:05,028
Like, we don't know
how Charlie died exactly

291
00:15:05,108 --> 00:15:06,357
and the moon is
in the wrong spot right now.

292
00:15:06,442 --> 00:15:08,022
Look, I know
you don't trust her,

293
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,887
- but maybe Margo could--
- Or there's a Maori spell.

294
00:15:10,022 --> 00:15:12,385
I'd have to cut off a finger,
but they might be preferable.

295
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,268
To talking to Margo?

296
00:15:14,387 --> 00:15:18,098
Quentin, I need your help.
Highest priority.

297
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,182
- Let's go.
- Okay.

298
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:22,180
I--hey, look,
you said it yourself,

299
00:15:22,265 --> 00:15:23,424
you don't have all the facts,

300
00:15:23,515 --> 00:15:24,878
so maybe you don't need a spell.

301
00:15:25,014 --> 00:15:26,261
Maybe you need information,

302
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,258
and Margo's Discipline
is gossip, so…

303
00:15:40,255 --> 00:15:42,752
We have a real problem.

304
00:15:42,869 --> 00:15:44,083
Is it in the box?

305
00:15:45,668 --> 00:15:47,532
Professor Sunderland
came looking for a book

306
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,697
from the Physical
Cottage Library,

307
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,413
and it's missing.

308
00:15:51,532 --> 00:15:52,729
I diverted
her attention, but--

309
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,028
What does that have to do with the box?

310
00:15:54,163 --> 00:15:56,327
Books at Brakebills, Quentin,

311
00:15:56,412 --> 00:15:57,526
are not just books.

312
00:15:57,611 --> 00:15:58,858
One goes missing, it's not just

313
00:15:58,993 --> 00:16:00,657
a library fine
we're talking about here.

314
00:16:00,742 --> 00:16:03,072
- What're we talking about?
- We're talking about--

315
00:16:03,191 --> 00:16:05,521
we have…

316
00:16:05,656 --> 00:16:07,353
occasional parties.

317
00:16:07,438 --> 00:16:09,019
During one, someone took a book,

318
00:16:09,155 --> 00:16:10,735
and if we don't find that book

319
00:16:10,853 --> 00:16:12,849
the faculty are going to take
a harder look at our parties,

320
00:16:12,935 --> 00:16:14,599
and that cannot happen, Quentin.

321
00:16:17,349 --> 00:16:20,179
So you gonna tell me
what's in the box or…

322
00:16:24,594 --> 00:16:26,391
What the hell is that?

323
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,007
The missing book is Volume One.

324
00:16:28,143 --> 00:16:31,589
That…is Volume Two.

325
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:37,169
She's going to lead us
to her mate.

326
00:16:37,255 --> 00:16:39,001
Oh.

327
00:16:39,136 --> 00:16:41,749
<i>Odemknout.</i>

328
00:16:44,882 --> 00:16:46,829
<i>Odemknout.</i>

329
00:16:46,915 --> 00:16:48,296
Shit.

330
00:16:48,381 --> 00:16:50,161
Uh, let me--
let me try it again.

331
00:16:50,296 --> 00:16:53,126
Should be easy.
You're distracted.

332
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:55,041
I know I have a lot going on.

333
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:56,519
No, you don't.
You have this spell.

334
00:16:56,576 --> 00:16:58,156
That's it.

335
00:17:00,157 --> 00:17:03,319
So how do you manage it all?

336
00:17:03,404 --> 00:17:06,484
Juggling magic and your life?

337
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:10,782
I don't understand the question.

338
00:17:10,867 --> 00:17:12,481
I'm not judging you.

339
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:16,028
I started out like you
and you have a good life.

340
00:17:16,147 --> 00:17:17,944
Boyfriend.

341
00:17:18,029 --> 00:17:20,143
Probably think
he keeps you centered.

342
00:17:20,229 --> 00:17:22,192
- Right?
- Kinda.

343
00:17:22,311 --> 00:17:26,139
Or, you know, you're keeping
him around in case you fail here

344
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:28,970
and need to fall back.

345
00:17:29,056 --> 00:17:31,802
All I know…
you have to mean it

346
00:17:31,938 --> 00:17:33,269
for magic to work.

347
00:17:33,354 --> 00:17:36,933
Something clicks
when you're all-in,

348
00:17:37,018 --> 00:17:41,630
and the real big stuff,
you can't do it

349
00:17:41,715 --> 00:17:44,844
till you're doing it
without a net.

350
00:17:57,788 --> 00:18:00,452
I…

351
00:18:00,587 --> 00:18:01,918
I need your help.

352
00:18:02,003 --> 00:18:05,116
That wasn't so hard, was it?

353
00:18:07,117 --> 00:18:08,664
Look, I'm just trying

354
00:18:08,782 --> 00:18:10,613
to find out what happened
to my brother.

355
00:18:10,748 --> 00:18:13,111
He was a student here
five years ago.

356
00:18:13,247 --> 00:18:14,993
Okay.

357
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,273
He was a physical kid.

358
00:18:20,358 --> 00:18:22,821
His name was Charlie,

359
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,271
and he died.

360
00:18:24,356 --> 00:18:28,236
Know what?
I did hear about that.

361
00:18:28,321 --> 00:18:30,401
At Woof, right?

362
00:18:30,487 --> 00:18:33,766
Five, six years back?

363
00:18:33,851 --> 00:18:35,564
It's all making sense now.

364
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,730
- What is?
- You.

365
00:18:37,814 --> 00:18:39,562
The awkward thing.

366
00:18:39,648 --> 00:18:42,759
The anger underneath
the ineffable air of tragedy

367
00:18:42,895 --> 00:18:45,426
you wear like a perfume.

368
00:18:47,343 --> 00:18:50,306
Look, can you just tell me
what you know about Charlie?

369
00:18:50,425 --> 00:18:52,387
- Please?
- Loathe as I am to admit it,

370
00:18:52,473 --> 00:18:56,136
I don't actually know anything.

371
00:18:56,254 --> 00:18:58,218
Although, there was a girl

372
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,749
from Charlie's year who might.

373
00:19:00,835 --> 00:19:03,248
Emily Greenstreet.

374
00:19:03,383 --> 00:19:04,747
Who was she?

375
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,213
Just a girl.

376
00:19:06,298 --> 00:19:08,878
When he died,
apparently she took it hard.

377
00:19:08,963 --> 00:19:10,793
Dropped out.
Gave up magic.

378
00:19:10,912 --> 00:19:12,375
The Full Muggle.

379
00:19:12,461 --> 00:19:14,241
It was a bit of a scandal.

380
00:19:14,326 --> 00:19:15,624
Where is she now?

381
00:19:15,742 --> 00:19:16,873
The city.

382
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,406
Fogg set her up with a job

383
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:21,737
which is how you know
they're hiding something big.

384
00:19:21,873 --> 00:19:23,952
I know how to find her.

385
00:19:24,071 --> 00:19:25,401
Come on, I'll show you.

386
00:19:25,486 --> 00:19:27,867
I'd actually prefer to go alone.

387
00:19:27,952 --> 00:19:31,114
Oh, I know you would, but…

388
00:19:31,233 --> 00:19:33,230
what choice do you really have?

389
00:19:44,143 --> 00:19:46,522
Penny.

390
00:19:46,608 --> 00:19:49,887
Welcome.
Knew you were coming.

391
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,603
I know you've been
dreading this,

392
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,934
but you're gonna like it.

393
00:19:54,052 --> 00:19:57,183
The coves are for meditation

394
00:19:57,267 --> 00:19:59,880
while the enclosed
"Consciousness Areas"

395
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:03,429
are reserved as a place
to cry, and process.

396
00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:07,876
Hm.

397
00:20:07,962 --> 00:20:10,208
We call it "The Amplifier."

398
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:12,340
So basically, it's like turning

399
00:20:12,426 --> 00:20:14,422
your psychic powers up to 11.

400
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,038
Why would you wanna do that?

401
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:17,703
Oh, I get it.

402
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:20,169
You're one of those guys
who's trying to shut it out.

403
00:20:20,254 --> 00:20:22,367
You wanna get control of it

404
00:20:22,452 --> 00:20:25,865
or it will mess up your shit
big time,

405
00:20:26,001 --> 00:20:27,864
and this is the best place
to practice.

406
00:20:27,949 --> 00:20:30,413
So…

407
00:20:30,532 --> 00:20:31,662
I do what?

408
00:20:31,747 --> 00:20:32,861
Sit.

409
00:20:32,947 --> 00:20:34,161
Relax.

410
00:20:34,245 --> 00:20:35,859
Let your mind wander.

411
00:20:35,945 --> 00:20:37,192
It's pretty simple.

412
00:20:37,327 --> 00:20:39,574
But you gotta start
by letting go, tough guy.

413
00:20:39,692 --> 00:20:42,405
Less talking.

414
00:20:42,524 --> 00:20:43,688
No touching.

415
00:21:11,557 --> 00:21:13,221
<i>Help!</i>

416
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,719
<i>Please!</i>
<i>Help me!</i>

417
00:21:26,636 --> 00:21:28,266
Emily?

418
00:21:29,717 --> 00:21:31,048
No, don't run.

419
00:21:31,133 --> 00:21:32,714
These shoes are insane.

420
00:21:35,798 --> 00:21:38,410
You're from Brakebills,
aren't you?

421
00:21:38,862 --> 00:21:40,426
That part of my life
is behind me.

422
00:21:40,544 --> 00:21:43,257
- I'm sorry.
- Charlie was my brother.

423
00:21:49,664 --> 00:21:53,160
I just wanna know
what happened to him.

424
00:21:53,295 --> 00:21:56,625
Your brother saved my life.

425
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,823
Well, he tried to at least.

426
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,988
So, I fell for this professor.

427
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:05,319
I know how it sounds,

428
00:22:05,455 --> 00:22:08,317
but I was young and…

429
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:11,315
and he loved me.

430
00:22:11,401 --> 00:22:15,198
But then, well, he was married.

431
00:22:15,315 --> 00:22:17,312
You know how it is
when you're that age.

432
00:22:17,398 --> 00:22:20,694
You get…terrible ideas.

433
00:22:20,813 --> 00:22:23,276
Hmm.

434
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,524
Like what?

435
00:22:25,643 --> 00:22:29,305
I thought I could
make him love me again.

436
00:22:29,441 --> 00:22:31,470
Oh, some kind of love spell?

437
00:22:31,606 --> 00:22:34,635
No.

438
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:36,517
No.

439
00:22:36,636 --> 00:22:41,432
I thought if I could
make myself prettier.

440
00:22:41,516 --> 00:22:44,014
Oh…God.

441
00:22:44,133 --> 00:22:46,295
No one warned you
how dangerous that was?

442
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:49,260
I knew, but I'd convinced myself

443
00:22:49,345 --> 00:22:53,923
that it was the only way.

444
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:56,789
It took me weeks

445
00:22:56,874 --> 00:22:59,587
to figure out how to do it,

446
00:22:59,672 --> 00:23:02,285
and…

447
00:23:02,371 --> 00:23:04,751
<i>when I did, well, you--</i>

448
00:23:04,836 --> 00:23:06,450
<i>you can imagine how that went.</i>

449
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,944
No…

450
00:23:24,607 --> 00:23:28,104
I was gonna--I was
gonna kill myself.

451
00:23:28,189 --> 00:23:30,901
Emily!

452
00:23:30,987 --> 00:23:33,067
Wait!

453
00:23:33,153 --> 00:23:35,266
What happened?

454
00:23:35,402 --> 00:23:37,264
What did you do?

455
00:23:42,597 --> 00:23:44,760
Please.

456
00:23:44,845 --> 00:23:47,592
I just wanna help.

457
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,717
Don't tell anyone, please.

458
00:24:01,802 --> 00:24:03,049
Course not.

459
00:24:03,135 --> 00:24:04,631
Wait here.
I'll be back.

460
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,247
I'm gonna fix this.

461
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:12,460
He mashed a…

462
00:24:12,578 --> 00:24:13,910
bunch of stuff together.

463
00:24:13,995 --> 00:24:15,741
<i>It was--</i>

464
00:24:15,826 --> 00:24:17,291
<i>It was totally untested.</i>

465
00:24:19,325 --> 00:24:21,571
I really believed

466
00:24:21,707 --> 00:24:24,736
he might actually
be able to undo what I did.

467
00:24:24,871 --> 00:24:27,867
He was a good magician.

468
00:24:27,953 --> 00:24:30,067
You know, he--

469
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:34,115
he woulda done anything for me.

470
00:24:34,232 --> 00:24:36,229
<i>It was a lot.</i>
<i>It was--it was--</i>

471
00:24:36,315 --> 00:24:39,227
It was too much.

472
00:24:39,363 --> 00:24:43,275
I begged him to stop,
but he wouldn't,

473
00:24:43,394 --> 00:24:46,723
and that's when it went
totally out of control.

474
00:24:57,136 --> 00:24:59,432
It burned…

475
00:24:59,551 --> 00:25:02,681
right through him…

476
00:25:02,766 --> 00:25:07,177
until he wasn't there anymore.

477
00:25:07,262 --> 00:25:10,676
He was--
Do you know what a Niffin is?

478
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:14,874
- No.
- Yes.

479
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:16,838
It's when too much
runs through you.

480
00:25:16,924 --> 00:25:19,038
Consumes you.

481
00:25:19,172 --> 00:25:22,086
Only the magic is left,

482
00:25:22,204 --> 00:25:25,034
but you're not

483
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:26,250
you anymore.

484
00:25:26,367 --> 00:25:28,582
You're…

485
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:31,530
lost.

486
00:25:31,666 --> 00:25:34,029
Where did Charlie go?

487
00:25:34,114 --> 00:25:35,494
I don't know.

488
00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:39,492
He was just gone.

489
00:25:39,577 --> 00:25:41,857
I never saw him again.

490
00:25:41,992 --> 00:25:44,689
Um, who did all this then?

491
00:25:46,939 --> 00:25:49,070
My professor.

492
00:25:49,187 --> 00:25:52,350
Well, I guess you got
his attention after all.

493
00:25:52,436 --> 00:25:53,733
I quit school.

494
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:56,315
Gave up magic,
and never looked back.

495
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,928
I'm so sorry about Charlie.

496
00:26:05,395 --> 00:26:08,675
Hear that?
She's getting excited.

497
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:11,007
I think we're close.

498
00:26:11,092 --> 00:26:13,422
Hold this, will you?

499
00:26:17,388 --> 00:26:21,333
This bodega is warded
up the ass.

500
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,330
Hedge witches.

501
00:26:26,416 --> 00:26:28,995
Amateurs.
Magical D-leaguers.

502
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,328
Sad and desperate people.

503
00:26:31,463 --> 00:26:34,293
Once one of 'em offered
to blow me for a spell.

504
00:26:34,378 --> 00:26:36,791
It was fairly worth it.

505
00:26:36,877 --> 00:26:38,156
Let me do the talking.

506
00:27:02,478 --> 00:27:03,641
These are witches?

507
00:27:03,776 --> 00:27:06,023
Hm. Pathetic. No?

508
00:27:06,141 --> 00:27:09,971
Ugh, this kid's trying
Popper number four.

509
00:27:10,106 --> 00:27:12,220
It's painful.

510
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,715
Hear you're selling something.

511
00:27:21,132 --> 00:27:23,096
Quentin?

512
00:27:23,181 --> 00:27:25,295
Oh, hey.

513
00:27:30,646 --> 00:27:32,635
- What the hell are you doing here?
- What the hell are you doing here?

514
00:27:32,755 --> 00:27:34,385
You know these guys?

515
00:27:34,504 --> 00:27:35,782
Yeah, they're from Brakebills.

516
00:27:35,803 --> 00:27:36,885
- We're friends.
- That's right.

517
00:27:37,004 --> 00:27:38,125
We're from Brakebills.

518
00:27:38,245 --> 00:27:41,298
We're classically trained
and we want our book.

519
00:27:41,383 --> 00:27:44,130
We don't have your stupid book.

520
00:27:55,492 --> 00:27:57,321
Are they?

521
00:27:58,707 --> 00:28:00,120
Yep.

522
00:28:00,205 --> 00:28:01,403
Love wins.

523
00:28:15,564 --> 00:28:17,027
Hey!

524
00:28:17,145 --> 00:28:18,359
So, that's it?

525
00:28:18,478 --> 00:28:19,643
That's all you're
gonna say to me?

526
00:28:19,726 --> 00:28:21,307
Don't talk to her.
Keep going.

527
00:28:21,443 --> 00:28:23,440
I don't know what
you're doing here, Jules.

528
00:28:23,525 --> 00:28:25,273
You're better than this.

529
00:28:25,357 --> 00:28:27,021
You say that
like I had a choice.

530
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:28,470
- Of course you have a choice.
- No, because guess what?

531
00:28:28,605 --> 00:28:31,351
Magic wasn't just handed to me.

532
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:35,499
I told you to please
tell them about me.

533
00:28:35,602 --> 00:28:37,298
At first, you know,
I thought maybe

534
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:39,431
they'd actually test me again,

535
00:28:39,516 --> 00:28:41,096
and then I figured someone
would at least come

536
00:28:41,181 --> 00:28:44,127
and try to take my memory
again, and then…

537
00:28:44,213 --> 00:28:46,793
just waiting.

538
00:28:46,928 --> 00:28:48,291
It took me weeks to realize

539
00:28:48,377 --> 00:28:52,256
you never even
told them about me at all.

540
00:28:52,341 --> 00:28:55,005
- Look, Jules, I--
- You were my best friend.

541
00:28:55,122 --> 00:28:57,786
Yeah, and so I let it go.

542
00:28:57,871 --> 00:29:00,251
What does that mean,
"you let it go?"

543
00:29:00,336 --> 00:29:01,951
No, that's crazy,
I can actually do--

544
00:29:02,086 --> 00:29:04,499
The people at Brakebills,
Jules, they can bend light.

545
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:06,164
They can read minds.
They can fly.

546
00:29:06,282 --> 00:29:08,413
You can do a party trick.

547
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,493
So this is it, huh?

548
00:29:13,612 --> 00:29:15,325
The real you.

549
00:29:15,444 --> 00:29:18,107
Do you ever stop to think
about how maybe you treated me?

550
00:29:18,193 --> 00:29:19,773
What?

551
00:29:19,907 --> 00:29:21,322
I was always there--

552
00:29:21,441 --> 00:29:23,238
What? You were so nice
and you were so sweet

553
00:29:23,322 --> 00:29:26,269
to poor little Q who couldn't
get his shit together.

554
00:29:26,354 --> 00:29:28,100
- Don't put that on me.
- Between you and James it was

555
00:29:28,236 --> 00:29:29,767
- a two for one charity case.
- That's your interpretation.

556
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:31,599
- Why are you saying this?
- Because that is true, Julia!

557
00:29:31,684 --> 00:29:35,564
- No, that's not true. I--
- You know how I felt about you.

558
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:37,312
- I don't know what--
- Admit it. Just admit it.

559
00:29:37,431 --> 00:29:39,344
Admit it.

560
00:29:42,261 --> 00:29:44,091
So, you're gonna
punish me for that?

561
00:29:44,227 --> 00:29:46,090
I don't know what else to say.

562
00:29:46,226 --> 00:29:49,222
You can't blame me.

563
00:29:49,307 --> 00:29:51,720
Does James even
know that you're here?

564
00:29:51,806 --> 00:29:53,253
You're hanging out
with a bunch of tweakers

565
00:29:53,339 --> 00:29:54,657
who are turning tricks
for spells.

566
00:29:54,754 --> 00:29:56,084
Are you kidding me?
These people wanna--

567
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,417
Stop slumming
because you're pissed

568
00:29:57,553 --> 00:29:59,332
that you lost
for once in your life.

569
00:30:02,499 --> 00:30:05,045
I'm sorry, but I mean it.

570
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,578
You could really get hurt
doing this shit,

571
00:30:06,663 --> 00:30:09,709
and for what?

572
00:30:09,795 --> 00:30:13,124
Grow up.

573
00:30:13,243 --> 00:30:15,157
Do you love magic?

574
00:30:17,823 --> 00:30:19,820
Is it in your soul?

575
00:30:24,236 --> 00:30:27,233
Is it like the secret heart
of what you always were?

576
00:30:30,615 --> 00:30:33,445
Yeah.

577
00:30:33,564 --> 00:30:36,276
So you know how I feel.

578
00:31:09,043 --> 00:31:11,373
Get in.

579
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:21,999
Penny, how's your head?

580
00:31:22,084 --> 00:31:24,415
How you think?

581
00:31:26,949 --> 00:31:28,329
So, what's wrong with me?

582
00:31:28,414 --> 00:31:29,863
Nothing's wrong.

583
00:31:29,997 --> 00:31:32,161
I made the mistake of thinking
you were just psychic,

584
00:31:32,246 --> 00:31:35,359
but it…
it's more complicated.

585
00:31:35,495 --> 00:31:38,906
You are a Traveller.

586
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:41,571
A what now?

587
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,020
The rarest

588
00:31:43,106 --> 00:31:44,819
and most difficult Discipline.

589
00:31:44,905 --> 00:31:46,818
Travellers can,
with a little bit of training,

590
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:48,734
go anywhere on Earth instantly

591
00:31:48,853 --> 00:31:50,316
just as you did.

592
00:31:50,401 --> 00:31:54,347
But you can, with a great
deal of training,

593
00:31:54,483 --> 00:31:57,979
actually move between worlds.

594
00:31:58,063 --> 00:32:00,177
- Go to other worlds?
- Yes.

595
00:32:00,263 --> 00:32:03,559
If the gift
does not kill you first.

596
00:32:03,677 --> 00:32:06,840
Great. Just fucking great.

597
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:10,004
Do you know why I'm here?

598
00:32:10,139 --> 00:32:11,504
To say this.

599
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:13,635
You've been a thin layer
of insouciance

600
00:32:13,721 --> 00:32:17,050
over an open pit of self-pity
your entire life.

601
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:18,965
This is not a joke.

602
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:20,665
You do not have the luxury
to mess around

603
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,330
now that this is
out of the bottle.

604
00:32:22,466 --> 00:32:24,329
You will study this.
You will master this.

605
00:32:24,415 --> 00:32:25,829
Do you understand?

606
00:32:25,914 --> 00:32:28,660
Ain't you a bucket of empathy,
blind man.

607
00:32:28,795 --> 00:32:31,459
Please say yes.

608
00:32:31,544 --> 00:32:34,989
I cannot see you nod.

609
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:37,038
Fine.

610
00:32:38,074 --> 00:32:40,070
Yes.

611
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,867
So, are we just gonna drive
all the way back to Brakebills?

612
00:32:44,985 --> 00:32:47,865
We're already there.

613
00:32:58,062 --> 00:33:00,691
Penny.

614
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:02,940
I've learned a great deal

615
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:04,688
about Travelling over the years.

616
00:33:04,807 --> 00:33:06,604
We'll start one-on-one tutorials

617
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:08,520
to help you get
a handle on your ability.

618
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:09,968
Yes,

619
00:33:10,104 --> 00:33:12,800
before you accidentally
transport yourself

620
00:33:12,885 --> 00:33:16,298
inside a volcano.

621
00:33:26,294 --> 00:33:28,458
She's right.

622
00:33:28,593 --> 00:33:29,790
We were best friends.

623
00:33:31,842 --> 00:33:33,455
- Should we help?
- No.

624
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:35,837
<i>Let me in, you assholes!</i>

625
00:33:35,954 --> 00:33:39,785
I don't know what happened.
I don't know how it got so bad.

626
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:41,783
You found out who you are

627
00:33:41,918 --> 00:33:44,498
and she found out who she's not.

628
00:33:44,617 --> 00:33:45,747
Life.

629
00:33:49,114 --> 00:33:51,944
Tell you what.

630
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:55,109
Let's not talk.

631
00:33:57,909 --> 00:33:59,773
Shit!

632
00:34:02,357 --> 00:34:05,102
How long were you to douchebags
gonna leave me out there?

633
00:34:05,238 --> 00:34:08,234
Oh, never mind that.

634
00:34:08,319 --> 00:34:11,315
Now you're with your people.

635
00:34:11,434 --> 00:34:13,980
Cheers to that.

636
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:16,646
Good God.

637
00:34:18,263 --> 00:34:21,842
Cheers.

638
00:34:25,182 --> 00:34:26,941
So, this Niffin box?

639
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,909
- This have a lid?
- There isn't one.

640
00:34:31,044 --> 00:34:32,290
The Niffin becomes
fused with the wood.

641
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:33,957
It's unable to escape.

642
00:34:34,075 --> 00:34:36,122
- How do you activate it?
- There's a short chant.

643
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,738
You just basically repeat
"I bind you"

644
00:34:37,822 --> 00:34:39,121
in Turkish and English.

645
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,702
That sounds a little easy.

646
00:34:40,788 --> 00:34:42,536
Well, that and the
month long incantation it took

647
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,233
to enchant the thing
in the first place.

648
00:34:44,369 --> 00:34:47,899
So, this is
the enchantment research?

649
00:34:48,034 --> 00:34:50,531
We're not gonna use the box.

650
00:34:50,615 --> 00:34:52,862
What?

651
00:34:52,948 --> 00:34:54,529
We're gonna bring Charlie back.

652
00:34:54,613 --> 00:34:57,226
Okay, Alice this is the point

653
00:34:57,312 --> 00:35:00,192
where I look at you
like you're nuts.

654
00:35:00,276 --> 00:35:02,056
I--okay, look.

655
00:35:02,192 --> 00:35:03,555
I've been doing some research,

656
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:06,437
um, on Niffins.

657
00:35:06,556 --> 00:35:07,720
Look, they're not even alive.

658
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:10,185
Th--they're…
something else.

659
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,885
Look, I can't explain it,

660
00:35:12,019 --> 00:35:13,883
but I know that he's out there.
He's somewhere.

661
00:35:13,985 --> 00:35:15,099
Is there anything
in the literature that says

662
00:35:15,217 --> 00:35:16,598
that going Niffin is reversible?

663
00:35:16,717 --> 00:35:18,380
Nothing says that it isn't.

664
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,379
Exactly.

665
00:35:20,514 --> 00:35:22,378
So I found this spell
that can transmutate

666
00:35:22,464 --> 00:35:25,877
certain meta-quantum energies
into matter…in theory.

667
00:35:26,011 --> 00:35:27,708
And I combined it with an
advanced transformation ritual--

668
00:35:27,843 --> 00:35:29,173
Alice, this is Major Arcana--

669
00:35:29,258 --> 00:35:30,540
What? Just because
you couldn't do it?

670
00:35:30,675 --> 00:35:32,005
Nobody could do it.

671
00:35:32,091 --> 00:35:33,204
You're making it up
as you go along.

672
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:35,003
Look, I--

673
00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:37,202
- You are an amazing magician--
- Don't patronize me.

674
00:35:37,288 --> 00:35:38,585
I'm not patronizing you.
I'm telling you that

675
00:35:38,704 --> 00:35:40,833
- this is not a good idea.
- What do you know?

676
00:35:40,919 --> 00:35:42,533
Hmm?

677
00:35:42,668 --> 00:35:43,831
You only learned
about magic, what?

678
00:35:43,917 --> 00:35:45,698
- Three months ago?
- Okay, sure.

679
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:47,530
I--but even I can tell
that this is crazy.

680
00:35:47,614 --> 00:35:49,328
I don't understand
why you can't see that.

681
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:51,528
Fine. Stay behind.

682
00:35:51,662 --> 00:35:52,910
I'm here, and I'm only here,
to find out

683
00:35:53,028 --> 00:35:54,242
what happened to Charlie,

684
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:55,679
and now that I know
I can help him

685
00:35:55,743 --> 00:35:57,490
I'm going to.

686
00:36:15,265 --> 00:36:17,644
Thanks for coming so quick.

687
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:20,343
I was kinda surprised
you called.

688
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:22,509
Thought you disappeared again.

689
00:36:22,644 --> 00:36:24,474
You okay?

690
00:36:25,759 --> 00:36:28,339
You wanna talk about it?

691
00:36:28,425 --> 00:36:30,721
Please?

692
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,802
- Last call, Julia.
- I--

693
00:36:32,888 --> 00:36:36,217
I don't know
how to talk about it.

694
00:36:38,885 --> 00:36:42,081
I got involved with something.

695
00:36:43,498 --> 00:36:46,993
Made me wanna
give up everything.

696
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,126
Life, school…

697
00:36:49,211 --> 00:36:52,957
all of it.

698
00:36:53,043 --> 00:36:55,656
It got under my skin,

699
00:36:55,741 --> 00:36:57,704
and it--

700
00:36:57,823 --> 00:37:01,652
And?

701
00:37:01,737 --> 00:37:04,484
Jules, just tell me.

702
00:37:07,234 --> 00:37:10,197
It's Adderall.

703
00:37:10,315 --> 00:37:12,862
I started taking it

704
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,477
when I was applying
to grad school,

705
00:37:14,612 --> 00:37:17,942
and then I was taking
more and more.

706
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:21,690
I know I've been a bitch,

707
00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:24,971
but lately I've been
going to meetings.

708
00:37:26,806 --> 00:37:28,968
Wow.

709
00:37:35,133 --> 00:37:37,297
I--

710
00:37:37,383 --> 00:37:39,014
Can I--

711
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:41,345
I don't know, can I hug you?

712
00:37:41,464 --> 00:37:44,293
I wish you would.

713
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,674
It's okay, Jules.

714
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:51,288
I really love you, you know.

715
00:37:51,374 --> 00:37:53,587
I know.
I'm amazing.

716
00:38:21,823 --> 00:38:25,152
Okay, so, we're here, and…

717
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,818
Arrive at the place
of his transformation.

718
00:38:27,936 --> 00:38:31,815
Present yourself.

719
00:38:31,933 --> 00:38:33,763
There's a third step.

720
00:38:33,848 --> 00:38:36,927
What's the third step?

721
00:38:37,063 --> 00:38:40,925
I have to call in to him with
something personal between us,

722
00:38:41,011 --> 00:38:43,391
um…

723
00:38:43,476 --> 00:38:46,089
so Charlie used to sing to me
my favorite song

724
00:38:46,225 --> 00:38:47,756
when I was feeling bad

725
00:38:47,891 --> 00:38:49,671

Charlie, Charlie?

736
00:39:47,189 --> 00:39:49,518
- Charlie, is that you?
- Alice.

737
00:39:49,604 --> 00:39:53,382
Oh, my God, Charlie,
I can't believe it's you.

738
00:39:53,517 --> 00:39:58,547
I missed you so much.
I don't even know what to say.

739
00:39:58,682 --> 00:40:01,877
Charlie, what are you doing?

740
00:40:01,963 --> 00:40:02,876
Charlie, you're hurting me.

741
00:40:02,962 --> 00:40:04,842
Charlie, that hurts.

742
00:40:08,009 --> 00:40:09,873
You're just confused,
Charlie, it's me.

743
00:40:12,924 --> 00:40:15,869
Charlie--Charlie,
why are you doing this?

744
00:40:16,005 --> 00:40:17,702
Why?

745
00:40:17,837 --> 00:40:19,033
Alice, I don't think--
I don't think that we should--

746
00:40:19,169 --> 00:40:20,033
I know you're in there, Charlie.

747
00:40:20,169 --> 00:40:21,583
- I know it's you.
- Alice!

748
00:40:21,702 --> 00:40:24,365
Hah!

749
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:28,412
Charlie, stop!
I can help you.

750
00:40:37,608 --> 00:40:39,238
Alice, stop!

751
00:40:48,685 --> 00:40:50,398
Alice, he's gonna kill us.
It's not gonna work.

752
00:40:50,517 --> 00:40:52,148
- You have to stop.
- Shut up, I can do this.

753
00:40:52,233 --> 00:40:53,730
Alice, it's not Charlie.

754
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,561
Oh, shit.
Shit.

755
00:41:00,395 --> 00:41:04,473
<i>Emrediyorum!</i>

756
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:09,054
Alice, stop!
You're gonna kill yourself.

757
00:41:09,173 --> 00:41:10,836
You are bound and held fast.

758
00:41:10,972 --> 00:41:12,835
<i>Seni baglamak!</i>

759
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,051
No!
No!

760
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:16,883
I bind you!
<i>Seni baglamak.</i>

761
00:41:17,001 --> 00:41:18,049
- No!
- I bind you!

762
00:41:18,168 --> 00:41:20,381
<i>Seni baglamak.</i>

763
00:41:28,411 --> 00:41:32,707
You--you brought the box.

764
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:36,154
Yeah.

765
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:38,037
Alice, he was gonna kill you.

766
00:41:38,156 --> 00:41:41,701
Why did you think
you had to save me?

767
00:41:41,819 --> 00:41:44,449
Fuck you, Quentin.

768
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:46,982
You had no idea
what I was doing.

769
00:41:47,067 --> 00:41:50,646
I was so close,
and now he's gone.

770
00:42:14,517 --> 00:42:16,297
Where you going, kitty cat?

771
00:42:16,432 --> 00:42:18,629
I'm done here.
For good.

772
00:42:18,764 --> 00:42:20,428
You should be happy.
Less competition.

773
00:42:20,514 --> 00:42:22,927
Alice.

774
00:42:23,012 --> 00:42:24,958
I like competition.

Look, I've never threatened

00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,564
I made the mistake of

<i>Magic wasn't just handed to me.</i>

23
00:00:53,901 --> 00:00:56,112
People at Brakebills, Jules,
they can read minds.

24
00:00:56,197 --> 00:00:58,564
They can fly.
You can do a party trick.

25
00:00:58,616 --> 00:01:00,032
You were my best friend.

26
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:01,484
It's amazing I survived
as long as I did

27
00:01:01,569 --> 00:01:05,241
not knowing that
I was a magician.

28
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:07,039
I can't go back.

00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:13,022

Hey! Big stuff.

33
00:02:44,422 --> 00:02:46,505
- Hey.
- Got 'em? I'm dying.

34
00:02:46,557 --> 00:02:48,340
Where are they?
Where are they?

35
00:02:48,426 --> 00:02:49,592
Oh, Jesus.

36
00:02:49,677 --> 00:02:51,060
- Where are they?
- Cut it out.

37
00:02:51,145 --> 00:02:53,646
You give me happy pills,
me love you long time.

38
00:02:53,681 --> 00:02:58,517
Eliot, they're looking
for you in arts and crafts.

39
00:02:58,603 --> 00:03:00,853
Watercolors.

40
00:03:00,905 --> 00:03:03,405
Without me, they're just--

41
00:03:06,027 --> 00:03:07,943
Quentin, could I speak to you?

42
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:15,701
Quentin?

43
00:03:15,753 --> 00:03:17,033
<i>Okay, this is obviously a dream</i>

44
00:03:17,038 --> 00:03:19,455
where I realize I'm in a dream.

45
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,861
So you think your life
is a dream?

46
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:21,875
No, my life is my life,

47
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:23,542
but this is like a--

48
00:03:23,628 --> 00:03:24,843
This is the bad collage.

49
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,795
You, the hospital,
the dean's office,

50
00:03:26,881 --> 00:03:28,881
the Brakebills--
it's all jumbled together.

51
00:03:28,966 --> 00:03:30,883
So we're back to Brakebills?

52
00:03:30,935 --> 00:03:32,101
Hopefully soon.

53
00:03:32,186 --> 00:03:33,886
Where you think you're a student

54
00:03:33,938 --> 00:03:35,888
studying to be a magician?

55
00:03:35,973 --> 00:03:38,357
Okay, let's just skip the part

56
00:03:38,392 --> 00:03:40,643
where you don't believe me,
okay?

57
00:03:40,728 --> 00:03:43,896
Um, yeah,
it's a little chilly in here.

58
00:03:43,981 --> 00:03:46,732
How about a miniature sun?

59
00:03:46,784 --> 00:03:48,067
That'd be great.

60
00:04:03,467 --> 00:04:04,750
I hate these dreams.

61
00:04:04,835 --> 00:04:06,302
It's like your feet
are stuck to the floor

62
00:04:06,387 --> 00:04:07,553
or you're paralyzed.

63
00:04:07,588 --> 00:04:09,305
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

64
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,757
You released me, remember,
in the real hospital?

65
00:04:11,842 --> 00:04:13,559
I remember what I said.
What was it?

66
00:04:13,594 --> 00:04:15,728
Uh, "You can't keep me here.

67
00:04:15,763 --> 00:04:17,479
I haven't hurt myself
or anybody else."

68
00:04:17,565 --> 00:04:18,731
You know that isn't true.

69
00:04:18,766 --> 00:04:20,432
Well, none of this is true,

70
00:04:20,484 --> 00:04:23,902
but I said that to you
in real life before Brakebills.

71
00:04:23,938 --> 00:04:27,656
Send him in.

72
00:04:27,742 --> 00:04:29,992
Quentin, do you remember why

73
00:04:30,077 --> 00:04:32,077
the court ordered you
to be here?

74
00:04:32,113 --> 00:04:35,614
The court? I don't…

75
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,866
If this is a trial dream,
I am--

76
00:04:37,952 --> 00:04:40,119
God, these things take forever.

77
00:04:40,171 --> 00:04:41,954
Come in, Penny.

78
00:04:42,006 --> 00:04:44,707
Show me again what you found
in Quentin's trash.

79
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:46,353
I don't want to get
nobody in trouble.

80
00:04:46,427 --> 00:04:48,344
No. Hey,
it's okay, Penny.

81
00:04:48,429 --> 00:04:49,928
No one's in trouble.

82
00:04:56,937 --> 00:04:58,971
Thank you, Penny.

83
00:05:03,277 --> 00:05:05,310
Quentin,

84
00:05:05,396 --> 00:05:07,029
this is what happens when you
don't take what we prescribe.

85
00:05:07,114 --> 00:05:09,815
You start to hallucinate again
that you're a magician,

86
00:05:09,867 --> 00:05:10,983
you have powers.

87
00:05:11,068 --> 00:05:13,035
It's all here--

88
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,705
uh, the house of cards, Alice,

89
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:22,795
Eliot, Margo,
the Physical Kids, The Beast.

90
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,631
I know this can
all seem very real,

91
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,332
but it's not.

92
00:05:27,385 --> 00:05:30,502
Brakebills is the hallucination.

93
00:05:30,554 --> 00:05:33,338
This is the reality.

94
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:35,340
You're seeing this, right?

95
00:05:35,393 --> 00:05:37,342
You're very, very sick.

96
00:05:40,514 --> 00:05:41,847
Are you not seeing this?

97
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:44,983
Oh, Jesus.

98
00:05:47,772 --> 00:05:50,572
I see you, Quentin,
and I'm very, very worried.

99
00:05:50,658 --> 00:05:53,942
Oh, okay.
They're gone.

100
00:05:54,028 --> 00:05:55,694
The moths, they're--

101
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,996
- They're gone.
- There are no moths, Quentin.

102
00:05:58,032 --> 00:06:00,032
There never were.

103
00:06:01,869 --> 00:06:03,786
Ah!

104
00:06:05,873 --> 00:06:07,623
Oh, I can't breathe.

105
00:06:10,795 --> 00:06:13,545
Code red! Code red!
Main office!

106
00:06:14,171 --> 00:06:29,443
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny

107
00:06:29,563 --> 00:06:31,613
Don't let them see.

108
00:06:34,151 --> 00:06:35,784
I heard they shot you up.

109
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,487
I'm kind of foggy.

110
00:06:38,572 --> 00:06:40,906
No, no, no.
Just focus on me, okay?

111
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:45,160
None of this is real.
Just us two.

112
00:06:45,246 --> 00:06:46,995
And this.

113
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:51,300
Where are we?

114
00:06:51,385 --> 00:06:53,669
I mean, what's going on?

115
00:06:53,754 --> 00:06:56,421
You don't remember?

116
00:06:56,474 --> 00:07:00,259
I--I was at school,
I think, and…

117
00:07:00,344 --> 00:07:02,144
And then I fell asleep
at a party,

118
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:06,148
and then I'm here

119
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:08,100
where none of that
ever happened, and--

120
00:07:08,185 --> 00:07:09,268
No, no, no, no, no, no.

121
00:07:09,353 --> 00:07:10,352
- Oh, man.
- No.

122
00:07:10,437 --> 00:07:13,105
You came to find me.

123
00:07:13,157 --> 00:07:14,773
I did?

124
00:07:14,859 --> 00:07:16,942
To save me.

125
00:07:16,994 --> 00:07:20,279
But first, we have
to break the illusion.

126
00:07:20,364 --> 00:07:21,864
The illusion?

127
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:23,909
I crash-landed on this planet
9.3 light-years ago.

128
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:25,667
- Alice?
- Wait.

129
00:07:25,753 --> 00:07:28,036
You're a starship captain,
and you came to rescue me.

130
00:07:28,122 --> 00:07:29,955
I--uh, no.
Hang on.

131
00:07:30,007 --> 00:07:31,507
But none of this is real.
It's--

132
00:07:31,592 --> 00:07:35,794
We're trapped in a cage,
a menagerie.

133
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,462
Alice?

134
00:07:37,548 --> 00:07:38,828
And they show us these illusions

135
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:40,299
to make us fall
in love and mate.

136
00:07:41,969 --> 00:07:45,137
Alice, that's enough.

137
00:07:45,222 --> 00:07:47,222
Give them back.

138
00:07:47,308 --> 00:07:49,308
- What, Dr. Fogg?
- All of them, Alice.

139
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,809
We need them for Bridge.

140
00:07:54,815 --> 00:07:56,148
They collect us
from all over the galaxy

141
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:57,533
to feed off our emotions.

142
00:07:57,618 --> 00:07:58,984
No, that's not true.

143
00:07:59,036 --> 00:08:00,569
It's an episode
of "Lost in Space."

144
00:08:00,654 --> 00:08:01,653
"Star Trek."

145
00:08:01,705 --> 00:08:02,988
What?

146
00:08:03,073 --> 00:08:04,434
That's an episode
of "Star Trek."

147
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:08,243
It's an episode
of "Star Trek."

148
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:10,212
They finally got to you.

149
00:08:10,297 --> 00:08:13,832
You belong to them now.

150
00:08:13,884 --> 00:08:15,083
It's okay.

151
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:17,920
I'll still mate with you.

152
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,505
All right, that's enough.

153
00:08:20,558 --> 00:08:22,341
- Me three!
- That's enough.

154
00:08:22,426 --> 00:08:23,842
Me three.

155
00:08:27,348 --> 00:08:32,184
Quentin, how are you?

156
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:36,120
Are you feeling any better?

157
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:38,574
I guess.

158
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:40,075
Good.

159
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:44,079
Are you up for seeing a visitor?

160
00:08:47,608 --> 00:08:50,118
Hey, Q.

161
00:08:52,793 --> 00:08:54,876
I mean, Yale's still
kind of a letdown--

162
00:08:54,961 --> 00:08:56,911
still, in the best way.

163
00:08:56,997 --> 00:08:58,913
I mean, you would've--

164
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:02,584
Well, you--I mean, you will
totally agree, you know,

165
00:09:02,669 --> 00:09:04,836
once, you know, it's you.

166
00:09:04,888 --> 00:09:06,337
When what?
When I'm out?

167
00:09:06,423 --> 00:09:08,173
It's just so much
easier than I--

168
00:09:08,258 --> 00:09:09,758
than we expected, is all.

169
00:09:09,843 --> 00:09:14,679
So you've been at Yale
these last few months,

170
00:09:14,731 --> 00:09:17,265
and I've been here?

171
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,100
You don't remember?

172
00:09:19,186 --> 00:09:22,103
This? No.

173
00:09:22,189 --> 00:09:24,239
Okay.

174
00:09:24,324 --> 00:09:27,358
James is sorry
he couldn't make it tonight,

175
00:09:27,444 --> 00:09:29,360
but he'll be by next week.

176
00:09:29,413 --> 00:09:33,531
You know, we had
to lock down a church.

177
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,116
Church?

178
00:09:35,202 --> 00:09:37,118
Mm-hmm.
For the wedding.

179
00:09:43,627 --> 00:09:46,544
Are you engaged?

180
00:09:49,382 --> 00:09:52,801
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

181
00:09:52,886 --> 00:09:54,207
Seriously,
it doesn't even matter.

182
00:09:54,221 --> 00:09:56,721
It's not important.

183
00:09:56,807 --> 00:09:59,724
- It's a spell.
- A spell?

184
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:03,645
We're all trapped in it,
and I'm the only one who knows.

185
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,230
Okay, look.
I know that I just--

186
00:10:05,282 --> 00:10:07,148
I sounded like Alice
just then, but I'll--

187
00:10:07,234 --> 00:10:12,487
Hey, um, I swear I'm not crazy.

188
00:10:12,572 --> 00:10:14,155
I want to understand, okay?

189
00:10:14,241 --> 00:10:15,406
- I want to help you.
- No.

190
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:17,909
- Just tell me.
- No. No.

191
00:10:17,994 --> 00:10:21,463
No. Okay, I can do this.

192
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,759
Oh, God, look.

193
00:10:34,845 --> 00:10:37,762
Jules.

194
00:10:37,814 --> 00:10:38,813
Jules, look.

195
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:40,431
Look.
Are you seeing this?

196
00:10:40,484 --> 00:10:43,268
Look!

197
00:10:43,353 --> 00:10:45,103
Are you guys--
are you not seeing this?

198
00:10:52,112 --> 00:10:54,946
Okay.

199
00:10:58,451 --> 00:11:00,451
- Don't…
- What?

200
00:11:00,504 --> 00:11:02,127
- Look at me like that.
- Q--

201
00:11:02,247 --> 00:11:04,289
Don't feel sorry for me.
Do not.

202
00:11:04,374 --> 00:11:07,625
I'm not me, and you're not you,
and this is not happening.

203
00:11:07,677 --> 00:11:09,260
Do you hear me?
This is not happening.

204
00:11:09,296 --> 00:11:10,628
I'm not--I'm not here.

205
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,297
I am the one that
got into Brakebills.

206
00:11:12,349 --> 00:11:14,349
- I'm in Brakebills!
- Hey, you!

207
00:11:14,434 --> 00:11:17,135
Keep your voice down.

208
00:11:17,187 --> 00:11:21,139
I'm sorry.
It's my fault, um…

209
00:11:21,224 --> 00:11:22,690
Sorry.

210
00:11:27,935 --> 00:11:31,634
Hey, I'm gonna go, okay?

211
00:11:31,754 --> 00:11:34,055
Um, I'll be back Friday.

212
00:11:36,156 --> 00:11:39,324
This can't be my life.

213
00:11:39,409 --> 00:11:41,409
Jules, it can't be.

214
00:11:48,168 --> 00:11:51,669
I wanted to see the fireworks.

215
00:11:51,755 --> 00:11:53,638
I really did.

216
00:11:56,226 --> 00:11:59,644
Wait.

217
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:02,513
How did you know
they were fireworks?

218
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:03,598
What?

219
00:12:03,683 --> 00:12:04,849
If you couldn't see them,

220
00:12:04,901 --> 00:12:06,568
how did you know
they were fireworks?

221
00:12:06,653 --> 00:12:08,186
You told me.

222
00:12:08,238 --> 00:12:12,190
I never said the word
"fireworks," Julia.

223
00:12:14,494 --> 00:12:16,611
What's going on here?

224
00:12:21,418 --> 00:12:23,534
Okay, did nobody see that?

225
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:27,171
- See what?
- You laughing at me.

226
00:12:27,207 --> 00:12:30,541
Laughing at you?

227
00:12:30,627 --> 00:12:33,344
What kind of a friend
would do that?

228
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,680
Exactly.

229
00:12:38,852 --> 00:12:40,802
Good-bye, Quentin.

230
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,643
What?

231
00:12:55,306 --> 00:12:58,724
All of them one by one.

232
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:00,843
Begin.

233
00:13:10,955 --> 00:13:13,772
I believe you, Quentin.

234
00:13:13,824 --> 00:13:16,909
You are a magician…

235
00:13:19,864 --> 00:13:21,747
A very bad one.

236
00:13:24,785 --> 00:13:27,119
One thing that's real:

237
00:13:27,171 --> 00:13:30,372
you're always a raging dick.

238
00:13:42,103 --> 00:13:44,353
Ellsworth Downs.

239
00:13:46,357 --> 00:13:48,807
Ellsworth Downs.

240
00:13:48,859 --> 00:13:51,226
Ellsworth Downs.

241
00:13:51,228 --> 00:13:53,395
Ellsworth.

242
00:13:53,447 --> 00:13:55,731
Ellsworth Downs.

243
00:14:00,738 --> 00:14:02,071
You know.

244
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,242
You know where to look, Quentin.

245
00:14:07,294 --> 00:14:09,211
I can't show you.

246
00:14:09,246 --> 00:14:12,381
I can't touch you.

247
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:15,000
It's very strong, this spell.

248
00:14:15,052 --> 00:14:16,135
It is?

249
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,753
It is a spell?

250
00:14:17,755 --> 00:14:20,973
It's in the book,
but the book is you.

251
00:14:21,008 --> 00:14:22,758
This is all you.

252
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,760
Me?

253
00:14:26,931 --> 00:14:29,098
Uh, which book?

254
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,766
Jane?

255
00:14:30,818 --> 00:14:33,736
I can't remember what,
uh--

256
00:14:33,771 --> 00:14:37,072
Jane, they gave me pills,
and I can't--I can't remember.

257
00:14:37,108 --> 00:14:39,825
Jane.

258
00:14:43,748 --> 00:14:45,364
<i>Jane.</i>

259
00:14:55,126 --> 00:14:56,208
No, No!

260
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,626
No, stop!
Stop it!

261
00:14:57,678 --> 00:14:59,678
Stop! No!

262
00:14:59,714 --> 00:15:01,380
The answer's in these books.

263
00:15:01,432 --> 00:15:06,885
Jane said that these books are
my key to getting out of here.

264
00:15:06,937 --> 00:15:09,722
Jesus.

265
00:15:09,774 --> 00:15:12,357
Every time I talk,
I sound batshit.

266
00:15:21,318 --> 00:15:23,118
Could I get some tape anyplace?

267
00:15:23,154 --> 00:15:24,787
Tape isn't permitted.

268
00:15:24,822 --> 00:15:27,823
Tape isn't permitted.
Right, I know.

269
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,408
But why, again?

270
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,327
'Cause you can harm
yourself or others.

271
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:33,796
It's tape.

272
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:35,664
That can strangle,
suffocate--

273
00:15:35,716 --> 00:15:38,667
Okay, what if you
watched me the whole time?

274
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:40,919
No one has that kind of time.

275
00:15:40,971 --> 00:15:42,805
I need to put these pages
back together.

276
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,673
You need to get
to music therapy.

277
00:15:49,346 --> 00:15:53,315
Music is a way for us
to express and receive feeling

278
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,401
in a way that is safe and fun

279
00:15:56,437 --> 00:15:58,937
and sometimes illuminating.

280
00:15:58,989 --> 00:16:00,272
So who'd like to begin?

281
00:16:00,324 --> 00:16:02,741
Oh, God,
please not that one song.

282
00:16:02,777 --> 00:16:04,159
Ah, I'm sorry.

283
00:16:04,195 --> 00:16:07,029
What was that, Penny?

284
00:16:07,031 --> 00:16:10,999
Oh, that one song, please, no.

285
00:16:11,035 --> 00:16:13,418
It gets in my head,
and it never leaves.

286
00:16:13,454 --> 00:16:14,787
Oh, which song is that?

287
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:17,256
"Michael Rowed
the Boat Ashore."

288
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:20,175
#Agree.

289
00:16:20,211 --> 00:16:21,710
Everything here is me.

290
00:16:21,762 --> 00:16:23,128
All right, everyone,

291
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,930
why don't we kick it off
with the Beatles?

292
00:16:24,965 --> 00:16:27,883
"Helter Skelter."
Helter Skelter," please!

293
00:16:27,885 --> 00:16:29,802

Hey, Penny, good luck
getting that out of your head.

326
00:17:49,022 --> 00:17:51,848
<i>Doctor…</i>

327
00:17:54,963 --> 00:17:57,628
I hear you were the hit of
music therapy today, Quentin.

328
00:17:57,748 --> 00:17:59,589
Look, I think I know
what's going on here,

329
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,114
and I think I know
how to get help.

330
00:18:01,234 --> 00:18:02,994
Well, help is why we're here.

331
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:04,614
No, it's not.

332
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,199
I don't mean to be rude,
but you're here

333
00:18:06,201 --> 00:18:07,367
because of a spell, and I need
to break the spell.

334
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,701
Quentin--

335
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:10,703
And if I can just reach
Penny, the real Penny,

336
00:18:10,705 --> 00:18:13,039
and if--if I can get
inside of his head--

337
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:14,290
Enough.

338
00:18:14,342 --> 00:18:16,176
That's enough.

339
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:24,434
Can I please have some tape?

340
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:27,804
Do you remember the last time
you saw your father?

341
00:18:29,391 --> 00:18:30,557
Dinner a few months ago.

342
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,724
Why?

343
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:40,867
Dad?

344
00:18:40,902 --> 00:18:44,237
Hello, Curly Q.

345
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:46,823
I…

346
00:18:56,418 --> 00:18:58,751
What happened to your face?

347
00:18:58,753 --> 00:19:01,254
Did you run into a door or…

348
00:19:04,092 --> 00:19:06,809
You did that, Quentin.

349
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,678
I--

350
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:13,066
Come on.

351
00:19:13,101 --> 00:19:15,101
It's time you see something.

352
00:19:20,575 --> 00:19:22,408
<i>Look, I'm telling you</i>
<i>it wasn't my dad.</i>

353
00:19:22,444 --> 00:19:24,077
<i>It was The Beast.</i>

354
00:19:24,112 --> 00:19:26,829
<i>I never even touched him!</i>
<i>I used battle magic,</i>

355
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,831
<i>the same magic that I'm gonna</i>
<i>use to get out of here.</i>

356
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:33,419
<i>Are you ready?</i>
<i>Come on. Come on!</i>

357
00:19:33,455 --> 00:19:35,371
<i>What did you do to my powers?</i>

358
00:19:35,423 --> 00:19:37,707
<i>I need my powers.</i>
<i>The Beast is here, okay?</i>

359
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,093
<i>He's coming for me.</i>
<i>He's coming for you.</i>

360
00:19:40,128 --> 00:19:41,511
<i>He is coming to kill us.</i>

361
00:19:41,546 --> 00:19:44,347
<i>You have got to give me</i>
<i>back my power!</i>

362
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,302
<i>I've got to save you!</i>

363
00:19:49,304 --> 00:19:50,720
<i>Ahh!</i>

364
00:19:55,393 --> 00:19:57,560
Do you remember that night?

365
00:19:57,612 --> 00:20:00,446
Um…

366
00:20:00,482 --> 00:20:02,649
Your father does.

367
00:20:02,651 --> 00:20:05,151
Tell him, Ted.

368
00:20:05,153 --> 00:20:06,569
He needs to hear it.

369
00:20:06,621 --> 00:20:10,657
He needs to know the truth
why he's here.

370
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:13,376
We were having dinner
to celebrate

371
00:20:13,411 --> 00:20:17,497
when you got into Yale, and…

372
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,165
in the middle of the restaurant,

373
00:20:19,217 --> 00:20:21,501
you suddenly said
there were moths everywhere.

374
00:20:21,503 --> 00:20:22,835
No.

375
00:20:22,887 --> 00:20:24,837
And then you started
calling me The Beast.

376
00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:26,756
Mm-mm.

377
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,675
You're lying.

378
00:20:28,677 --> 00:20:30,343
And then you picked up a knife.

379
00:20:30,345 --> 00:20:32,512
- Mm-mm. No.
- I tried to stop you.

380
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:35,848
I grabbed you.
I tried to stop you from…

381
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:38,184
What?
From--from what?

382
00:20:38,186 --> 00:20:40,653
You tried to kill
your father, Quentin.

383
00:20:50,505 --> 00:20:52,338
You need to stop fighting this
Quentin.

384
00:20:52,924 --> 00:20:56,944
The more you believe in magic,
Brakebills, The Beast,

385
00:20:57,064 --> 00:20:59,896
<i>the more harm you do.</i>

386
00:20:59,931 --> 00:21:04,267
<i>Accept who you are</i>
<i>and what's put you here.</i>

387
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:06,795
That's how you get better,
Quentin.

388
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:09,291
<i>I promise.</i>

389
00:21:09,326 --> 00:21:12,161
Hey, you, seriously, talk to me.

390
00:21:12,213 --> 00:21:16,331
Are you fucking with me?

391
00:21:18,135 --> 00:21:20,335
Dude.

392
00:21:20,421 --> 00:21:24,006
Uh, um, look, this'll
all be over soon, okay?

393
00:21:24,091 --> 00:21:26,508
Just try not
to get buried under it.

394
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,478

serving chicken curry,

418
00:22:20,481 --> 00:22:24,199
which is, of course,
my favorite.

426
00:22:48,843 --> 00:22:50,309

428
00:22:53,931 --> 00:22:57,015
Yeah, 'cause there's
no here, dumbass.

429
00:22:57,101 --> 00:22:58,233
This is all in your head.

430
00:22:58,269 --> 00:23:00,269
I'm in your head.

431
00:23:00,354 --> 00:23:02,488
Now stop singing that song so I
can go the fuck back to sleep.

432
00:23:02,573 --> 00:23:03,939
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

00:23:04,024 --> 00:23:06,074
Oh, my God.
It worked.

434
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,276
I did that.
I called you.

435
00:23:07,328 --> 00:23:08,994
I called you with the song.

436
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:11,029
- You called me?
- I'm in trouble.

437
00:23:11,115 --> 00:23:13,749
Seriously, help me.

438
00:23:13,784 --> 00:23:16,451
- What is today out there?
- Wednesday.

439
00:23:16,537 --> 00:23:19,371
So I've only been gone
for a night.

440
00:23:19,456 --> 00:23:21,039
Am I asleep there somewhere?

441
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:22,124
Man, I don't know
what you do at night,

442
00:23:22,209 --> 00:23:23,342
and I don't want to know.

443
00:23:23,427 --> 00:23:25,260
- Where are you?
- Trying to sleep.

444
00:23:25,296 --> 00:23:26,378
This is not a dream.

445
00:23:26,463 --> 00:23:27,880
It--it's a--

446
00:23:27,965 --> 00:23:30,265
All of this, it's a spell.

447
00:23:30,301 --> 00:23:34,853
Please, listen.
Find me, okay?

448
00:23:34,939 --> 00:23:36,138
Out there, find me.

449
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:39,141
I have to be conscious
to break the spell.

450
00:23:39,226 --> 00:23:40,692
Okay, you have to wake up.

451
00:23:40,778 --> 00:23:42,227
Wake up.

452
00:23:42,313 --> 00:23:43,695
Wake up. Wake up.

453
00:23:43,781 --> 00:23:44,897
Wake up. Wake up!
Wake up!

454
00:23:44,982 --> 00:23:47,449
You, you will not be shouting.

455
00:23:47,484 --> 00:23:48,984
End it now, buster.

456
00:23:49,036 --> 00:23:50,369
Wake the hell up!

457
00:23:58,746 --> 00:24:00,329
Okay.

458
00:24:00,414 --> 00:24:02,998
Good job.

459
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:06,051
Wow.

460
00:24:06,136 --> 00:24:10,339
My whole body, every part
of my body, is tingling.

461
00:24:10,391 --> 00:24:11,890
I mean, you didn't tell me
it would feel--

462
00:24:11,976 --> 00:24:14,092
So good?

463
00:24:14,178 --> 00:24:18,180
It's high-end, designer
cooperative magic.

464
00:24:18,232 --> 00:24:21,483
It does something to your cells
to channel all that juice.

465
00:24:21,518 --> 00:24:23,986
Everyone gets stronger.

466
00:24:24,021 --> 00:24:26,772
Um, I just, um…

467
00:24:26,857 --> 00:24:32,077
I didn't think Q
would, uh, fall in so deep.

468
00:24:32,162 --> 00:24:35,030
Oh, this is nothing.

469
00:24:35,115 --> 00:24:38,033
Uh, what--
what does that mean?

470
00:24:38,118 --> 00:24:39,998
Well, I mean he might want
to take his shoes off

471
00:24:40,004 --> 00:24:41,286
and get comfortable.

472
00:24:41,372 --> 00:24:42,871
We cooked up a whopper here.

473
00:24:42,957 --> 00:24:45,090
I don't really see him
getting out of it,

474
00:24:45,175 --> 00:24:46,959
even with your boyfriend's help.

475
00:24:50,047 --> 00:24:54,266
Mm, I thought the idea
was to just mess with him.

476
00:24:54,351 --> 00:24:58,186
My idea was to fuck him up hard,

477
00:24:58,222 --> 00:25:02,274
and you loved it even harder.

478
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:04,776
Yeah, yeah, fuck him up,
not kill him.

479
00:25:04,862 --> 00:25:06,194
Wait, what?
Kill him?

480
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,196
Oh, he's not gonna die.

481
00:25:08,232 --> 00:25:12,034
He just might not actually
ever wake up.

482
00:25:12,069 --> 00:25:13,952
Oh, my God.

483
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:16,238
Hey, you are not going
limp on me here.

484
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:19,741
This is game time, ladies.

485
00:25:19,827 --> 00:25:21,877
You got the ball, Kady.

486
00:25:21,912 --> 00:25:24,496
Don't drop it.

487
00:25:24,581 --> 00:25:28,083
Now go put all that
sweet hotness to work.

488
00:25:42,016 --> 00:25:44,316
Sorry.

489
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:20,282
Ellsworth Downs, Ellsworth…

490
00:26:21,072 --> 00:26:24,490
Downs, Ellis…

491
00:26:24,575 --> 00:26:26,292
Wirth-Downs,
Ellis Wirth-Downs.

492
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:27,576
The Madness Maker.

493
00:26:27,662 --> 00:26:29,495
Oh, God.

494
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,130
Okay.

495
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:32,604
"In all of Fillory,

496
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:36,835
"one magician could drive
every other magician insane.

497
00:26:37,257 --> 00:26:39,891

But soon, Jane figured out
how to break this curse."

512
00:27:18,348 --> 00:27:20,848
Thank you, Jane Chatwin.

513
00:27:20,934 --> 00:27:25,386
"The Madness Maker's
curse was"--

514
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:30,942
It's okay. It's okay.
I know this. I know this.

515
00:27:30,977 --> 00:27:34,362
I know this. I know this.
I know this.

516
00:27:34,447 --> 00:27:36,481
What did Jane say?

517
00:27:36,533 --> 00:27:38,616
God, why can't I remember?

518
00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:46,791
Okay, look, I am, like,
100% sure I invented you,

519
00:27:46,826 --> 00:27:50,578
so if you could please
just disappear?

520
00:27:52,582 --> 00:27:54,549
Look, it was a party.

521
00:27:54,634 --> 00:27:57,502
He's probably sleeping it off
under something

522
00:27:57,554 --> 00:27:59,137
or someone or--

523
00:27:59,172 --> 00:28:01,389
Hey.

524
00:28:01,474 --> 00:28:02,840
Where you been?

525
00:28:02,892 --> 00:28:04,676
I had to run into the city.

526
00:28:04,761 --> 00:28:06,310
What's up?

527
00:28:06,346 --> 00:28:08,896
Your lover man here
thinks our little Q

528
00:28:08,982 --> 00:28:10,431
got roofied last night.

529
00:28:10,517 --> 00:28:11,649
Look, we covered the house.

530
00:28:11,685 --> 00:28:13,234
Let's start checking the lab,

531
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:16,187
the libraries, or whatever.

532
00:28:16,272 --> 00:28:17,739
I know where he is.

533
00:28:22,862 --> 00:28:26,364
He crawled in here
and passed out around 1:00.

534
00:28:26,449 --> 00:28:29,367
Anyway, I've seen weirder.

535
00:28:29,419 --> 00:28:30,835
Come on.
Hey, wake up.

536
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:35,206
He's breathing.
That's something.

537
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:37,258
Let me try.

538
00:28:41,881 --> 00:28:43,765
This is bad.

539
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:45,183
How bad?

540
00:28:45,218 --> 00:28:47,101
"We need to tell the dean" bad.

541
00:28:56,196 --> 00:28:57,445
Now what?

542
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:59,397
We wait.

543
00:29:02,485 --> 00:29:04,786
When are you gonna tell me
what all this is for?

544
00:29:04,871 --> 00:29:06,537
I did.

545
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:08,706
Bigger, better magic.

546
00:29:08,742 --> 00:29:11,876
Yeah, you just
never mentioned how.

547
00:29:11,911 --> 00:29:14,128
I guess I could tell you now.

548
00:29:14,214 --> 00:29:15,413
No, I don't feel like it.

549
00:29:15,465 --> 00:29:17,215
Later maybe?

550
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:20,134
Mm, how about never?
That's a growing possibility.

551
00:29:22,722 --> 00:29:24,806
Hmm.

552
00:29:24,891 --> 00:29:27,308
Yes, I thought so.

553
00:29:27,393 --> 00:29:29,427
The spell is called
a Scarlatti Web.

554
00:29:29,512 --> 00:29:30,678
We cannot break it.

555
00:29:30,764 --> 00:29:32,180
No one can.

556
00:29:32,265 --> 00:29:34,932
Wait, he's not
gonna wake up ever?

557
00:29:34,984 --> 00:29:38,269
I said "no one,"
not "nothing."

558
00:29:38,321 --> 00:29:40,404
We need to summon a Matarese.

559
00:29:42,275 --> 00:29:45,943
Quentin, I really thought
we were making progress.

560
00:29:45,995 --> 00:29:47,862
I was wrong.

561
00:29:54,621 --> 00:29:55,620
No.
What are you--

562
00:29:55,622 --> 00:29:56,954
Lower the wards please.

563
00:30:05,298 --> 00:30:08,299
Very good. And now the South
wards.

564
00:30:11,738 --> 00:30:15,473
Dean Fogg following
the playbook.

565
00:30:15,542 --> 00:30:18,526
The only thing that can break
our spell on your ex-BFF

566
00:30:18,611 --> 00:30:22,814
is a Matarese--evil bug spirit
of the underworld.

567
00:30:22,899 --> 00:30:24,419
About the only way
one of those can get

568
00:30:24,484 --> 00:30:26,951
into this sugary wonderland

569
00:30:26,986 --> 00:30:29,620
<i>is to lower all the protective</i>
<i>wards and shields</i>

570
00:30:29,656 --> 00:30:33,241
in the school, letting any old
anyone waltz right in.

571
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:39,831
Welcome back to Brakebills.

572
00:30:39,883 --> 00:30:42,300
Let's go steal their shit.

573
00:30:54,397 --> 00:30:55,847
Careful.

574
00:31:00,486 --> 00:31:03,654
Good.

575
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:07,191
<i>Daemonium Matarese, ecce vocavi</i>

576
00:31:07,243 --> 00:31:09,660
<i>te in carcere liberare mens est.</i>

577
00:31:09,696 --> 00:31:12,413
<i>Imperio Scarlatti telem nobus.</i>

578
00:31:12,498 --> 00:31:15,583
That's the answer?

579
00:31:15,668 --> 00:31:17,335
It shorts out
the cerebral cortex,

580
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:19,587
which should break him
out of the spell,

581
00:31:19,672 --> 00:31:21,672
which should bring him back,
halfway.

582
00:31:21,708 --> 00:31:23,708
Halfway?

583
00:31:23,793 --> 00:31:26,711
The spell is like a prison
in the middle of the desert.

584
00:31:26,763 --> 00:31:28,679
The Matarese breaks you
out of the prison,

585
00:31:28,715 --> 00:31:31,883
but you have to get yourself
out of the desert,

586
00:31:31,968 --> 00:31:34,886
and it is a lot easier
with a guide.

587
00:31:34,971 --> 00:31:36,804
Penny, are you ready?

588
00:32:06,719 --> 00:32:08,636
Quentin?

589
00:32:11,507 --> 00:32:14,926
Quentin!
Answer me!

590
00:32:14,978 --> 00:32:18,396
The problem is
in your frontal lobe, Quentin.

591
00:32:18,431 --> 00:32:21,899
Your emotions are
in complete control now,

592
00:32:21,935 --> 00:32:26,320
overriding logic, reason,
even the will to live.

593
00:32:26,406 --> 00:32:27,772
So this…

594
00:32:29,993 --> 00:32:31,776
Is inserted into the eye socket.

595
00:32:31,828 --> 00:32:33,411
No, no, no, no, no.

596
00:32:33,446 --> 00:32:35,579
It's called
a transorbital lobotomy.

597
00:32:38,251 --> 00:32:39,867
Dad.

598
00:32:39,953 --> 00:32:42,870
Dad. Dad.

599
00:32:42,956 --> 00:32:44,672
No, no, no, no, no, no.

600
00:32:44,757 --> 00:32:46,624
No, no, don't!

601
00:32:46,709 --> 00:32:49,299
Dad, don't!

602
00:32:50,948 --> 00:32:52,047
Dad!

603
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:54,333
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

604
00:32:54,418 --> 00:32:56,747
No, please, don't.
I didn't mean to, I swear.

605
00:32:56,867 --> 00:32:58,754
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, stop!

606
00:32:58,806 --> 00:33:01,408
Stop talking.
Stop listening.

607
00:33:01,528 --> 00:33:04,445
There are only three things
that are real: you, me, and…

608
00:33:10,703 --> 00:33:12,987
That.

609
00:33:13,073 --> 00:33:14,655
Get up.
There are no straps.

610
00:33:14,707 --> 00:33:16,290
This is not a hospital.

611
00:33:16,326 --> 00:33:17,458
You are not crazy.

612
00:33:17,494 --> 00:33:19,077
You can make it disappear.

613
00:33:19,162 --> 00:33:20,495
Do it!

614
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,977
Quentin?

615
00:33:38,148 --> 00:33:41,182
The old alma mater
hasn't changed a lick.

616
00:33:41,234 --> 00:33:42,567
Wait, you went here?

617
00:33:42,652 --> 00:33:45,436
Kicked out three months
before graduation.

618
00:33:45,522 --> 00:33:48,573
So, what, this is revenge?

619
00:33:48,658 --> 00:33:50,024
When you're here for that long,

620
00:33:50,076 --> 00:33:51,609
they can't just erase you.

621
00:33:51,694 --> 00:33:53,277
They take you
into a special room

622
00:33:53,363 --> 00:33:54,695
off the dean's office

623
00:33:54,747 --> 00:33:57,665
and remove every memory
you make here.

624
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:04,005
Every single magical thing
you learned amputated,

625
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,040
but those memories are stored.

626
00:34:12,048 --> 00:34:13,598
Normally there's a shield
on this door

627
00:34:13,683 --> 00:34:15,716
a hundred magicians
couldn't break.

628
00:34:15,768 --> 00:34:18,102
Now…

629
00:34:19,556 --> 00:34:22,557
Keep a lookout.

630
00:34:22,609 --> 00:34:25,893
Wait, what's going--

631
00:34:31,384 --> 00:34:33,186
It isn't working.
What happened?

632
00:34:33,306 --> 00:34:35,094
I don't know.
I went there.

633
00:34:35,214 --> 00:34:37,381
I told him,
the Matarese did his thing,

634
00:34:37,501 --> 00:34:40,992
and then everything went black.

635
00:34:53,314 --> 00:34:54,814
Hey.

636
00:34:54,866 --> 00:34:56,399
He's not gonna wake up…

637
00:34:56,484 --> 00:34:57,400
ever.

638
00:34:57,485 --> 00:34:58,617
No, Marina
just has to--

639
00:34:58,653 --> 00:35:02,154
Marina is a psycho.

640
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,324
You were his friend.

641
00:35:05,376 --> 00:35:06,826
It's her spell.
I can't--

642
00:35:06,878 --> 00:35:09,495
No, I didn't sign up for this shit.

643
00:35:09,547 --> 00:35:13,833
No, you have to go
reverse it now.

644
00:36:01,048 --> 00:36:03,716
Well, I can finally
reach you again,

645
00:36:03,801 --> 00:36:06,469
but that's never been
the problem, has it--

646
00:36:06,554 --> 00:36:07,849
my reaching you?

647
00:36:07,969 --> 00:36:10,639
Will you please,
just for once--

648
00:36:10,725 --> 00:36:12,775
no more riddles, okay?

649
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,727
Just tell me what to do.

650
00:36:14,779 --> 00:36:17,279
It doesn't matter
what anyone tells you.

651
00:36:17,365 --> 00:36:18,731
You make the web you're in.

652
00:36:18,783 --> 00:36:21,484
You're the spider and the fly,

653
00:36:21,569 --> 00:36:23,235
just like…

654
00:36:31,295 --> 00:36:32,661
Look, I can help.

655
00:36:32,747 --> 00:36:34,213
I can give you the exact
wording of the spell.

656
00:36:34,248 --> 00:36:35,664
It's too late.

657
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,299
It was just supposed
to be a joke.

658
00:36:37,385 --> 00:36:39,300
Yeah, bullshit.
You did it to get even.

659
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,070
Oh, fuck you!
Somebody help him.

660
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:44,089
If I had the exact spell
wording one hour ago,--

661
00:36:44,175 --> 00:36:45,474
There's got to be something.

662
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,726
You have any idea
where he is right now?

663
00:36:47,762 --> 00:36:49,228
Why would you do this?

664
00:36:49,263 --> 00:36:51,096
She didn't.

665
00:36:51,182 --> 00:36:53,649
Not by herself.
Did you?

666
00:36:59,607 --> 00:37:01,740
You sure you want to play?

667
00:37:04,946 --> 00:37:09,532
No. I'm not sure of anything.

668
00:37:09,617 --> 00:37:13,285
Except I'm tired, so tired.

669
00:37:13,337 --> 00:37:15,704
Of?

670
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:17,840
Fighting all the time,

671
00:37:17,925 --> 00:37:19,425
becoming someone that
I actually want to be,

672
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:22,628
and then realizing that I…

673
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,848
am nothing.

674
00:37:25,933 --> 00:37:27,716
So you made the hospital,

675
00:37:27,802 --> 00:37:31,186
conjured that terrible thing
you never did to your father.

676
00:37:31,272 --> 00:37:33,389
Of course you're exhausted.

677
00:37:33,474 --> 00:37:37,359
And you can hide
from it all forever

678
00:37:37,445 --> 00:37:41,146
in this lovely, quiet,
blank void.

679
00:37:41,232 --> 00:37:43,482
But you also built a way out.

680
00:37:43,568 --> 00:37:46,485
Otherwise,
why are he and I here?

681
00:37:52,293 --> 00:37:56,545
"The Madness Maker didn't
play for the joy of winning,

682
00:37:56,631 --> 00:37:59,164
"just the fear of losing.

683
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,884
"The real curse was, he only
played when he could win,

684
00:38:01,969 --> 00:38:06,639
"which cut him off
from the surprise,

685
00:38:06,674 --> 00:38:10,476
horror, sadness,
and wonder of life."

686
00:38:14,315 --> 00:38:18,150
"Jane saw only one way
out for him:

687
00:38:18,185 --> 00:38:21,353
"stop playing.

688
00:38:21,439 --> 00:38:24,356
Start living."

689
00:38:36,704 --> 00:38:38,671
Hey.

690
00:38:38,706 --> 00:38:39,788
Somebody woke up.

691
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:41,395
Took your damn time.

692
00:38:41,657 --> 00:38:44,259
Somebody get him some brandy.

693
00:38:44,345 --> 00:38:46,428
Flying in.

694
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,753
Wait.

695
00:38:51,821 --> 00:38:54,255
Where's the hedge bitch?

696
00:38:54,341 --> 00:38:56,975
Chop-chop.

697
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,309
They're going back up.

698
00:39:08,891 --> 00:39:11,490
You should've told me your
friend wasn't properly erased.

699
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:13,243
I know.

700
00:39:13,748 --> 00:39:14,947
And you and Eliot
never should've taken on

701
00:39:15,032 --> 00:39:16,281
the hedge witches alone.

702
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:18,784
I know.

703
00:39:18,869 --> 00:39:24,270
Quentin, do you really think
that the magic that we teach

704
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:29,178
means that you just get
to fly above right and wrong?

705
00:39:29,263 --> 00:39:31,680
Magic does not solve problems.

706
00:39:31,766 --> 00:39:33,892
It magnifies them.
I know that too.

707
00:39:34,012 --> 00:39:35,434
Believe me.

708
00:39:36,051 --> 00:39:38,552
I don't need to be taught
what magic is or isn't.

709
00:39:38,637 --> 00:39:41,438
I need to be taught magic

710
00:39:41,523 --> 00:39:45,475
so that I can decide
what it is or isn't…

711
00:39:45,561 --> 00:39:48,562
for me.

712
00:39:48,614 --> 00:39:51,732
That was almost well put.

713
00:39:53,652 --> 00:39:55,569
Good night, Quentin.

714
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:02,325
Oh, and Quentin…

715
00:40:02,411 --> 00:40:05,579
I'm glad that you're
still here with us.

716
00:40:07,666 --> 00:40:11,585
Me too, actually.

717
00:40:18,761 --> 00:40:20,844
Wow.

718
00:40:20,929 --> 00:40:22,429
Wow.

719
00:40:25,567 --> 00:40:29,352
I kind of can't believe
I ever thought I knew…

720
00:40:29,438 --> 00:40:32,572
anything.

721
00:40:32,608 --> 00:40:34,608
I'd like to share now

722
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:38,612
some of it with some of you.

723
00:40:45,337 --> 00:40:46,870
Ow!

724
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,679
Wait. Wait.

725
00:40:55,764 --> 00:40:58,298
No. No.

726
00:40:58,383 --> 00:40:59,583
I didn't get you out of there

727
00:40:59,635 --> 00:41:01,635
because you pulled one
over on me.

728
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,471
You and Kady bitched out,
but you'd talk.

729
00:41:04,556 --> 00:41:08,642
She can't.

730
00:41:08,727 --> 00:41:13,363
Oh, poor you and your taste
of honey worse than none at all.

731
00:41:13,449 --> 00:41:16,983
You think Brakebills
cut you off from magic?

732
00:41:17,035 --> 00:41:19,903
You don't know cut off.

733
00:41:19,988 --> 00:41:22,322
But, baby…

734
00:41:24,576 --> 00:41:26,460
<i>You will.</i>

1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,599
Previously on "The Magicians"…

2
00:00:01,634 --> 00:00:02,934
You know, it should have worked.

3
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,469
The spell we did
to contact my brother.

4
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,557
I mean, I went over it,
like, a million times.

5
00:00:06,609 --> 00:00:08,694
Wait, you don't want
to try it again, do you?

6
00:00:08,786 --> 00:00:10,462
- No! No! No!
- I bind you!

7
00:00:10,608 --> 00:00:11,649
I bind you!

8
00:00:13,892 --> 00:00:15,531
Why did you think that
you had to save me?

9
00:00:15,611 --> 00:00:17,207
He was gonna kill you.

10
00:00:17,365 --> 00:00:19,542
I'm done here, for good.
You should be happy.

11
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:21,217
When are you gonna tell me
what all this is for?

12
00:00:21,252 --> 00:00:23,152
Bigger, better magic.

13
00:00:23,188 --> 00:00:26,056
Let's go steal their shit.

14
00:00:26,091 --> 00:00:27,891
He's not gonna wake up ever.

15
00:00:27,926 --> 00:00:29,726
Marina is a psycho.

16
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:32,728
You think Brakebills
cut you off from magic?

17
00:00:32,763 --> 00:00:34,130
Ow!

18
00:00:34,165 --> 00:00:36,132
You don't know cut off.

19
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:39,235
But you can actually move
between worlds.

20
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,537
If the gift does not
kill you first.

21
00:00:41,573 --> 00:00:44,073
Please, help me.

22
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:48,310
I have a full schedule today,
Quentin.

23
00:00:48,345 --> 00:00:50,412
- What?
- Uh, I just, um…

24
00:00:50,447 --> 00:00:52,275
The point?

25
00:00:52,883 --> 00:00:54,872
What's gonna happen to Julia?

26
00:00:55,242 --> 00:00:56,852
Ah, yes.

27
00:00:57,181 --> 00:00:59,722
Your hedge witch friend.

28
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:04,384
I'm going to kill her.

29
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,703
I, uh…

30
00:01:08,898 --> 00:01:10,532
I'm…

31
00:01:10,567 --> 00:01:13,235
I'm fucking with you, Quentin.

32
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,556
I'm not going
to do anything to her.

33
00:01:16,163 --> 00:01:18,906
I thought you would erase her
memory or something… again.

34
00:01:18,942 --> 00:01:22,376
Sure, then her buddies tell
her about magic all over again.

35
00:01:22,411 --> 00:01:25,073
Then she bothers me again.

36
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:26,630
So she's just gonna
get away with it?

37
00:01:26,722 --> 00:01:29,717
I'm not the magic police,
Quentin.

38
00:01:30,153 --> 00:01:31,630
They won't be back here.

39
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:34,188
They know what'll
rain down on them if they do.

40
00:01:34,423 --> 00:01:36,224
What they do out there,
it's not my business;

41
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:38,459
it's not yours.
Do you understand?

42
00:01:38,494 --> 00:01:40,160
Don't you worry,
Hedge witches tend

43
00:01:40,195 --> 00:01:43,535
to crash and burn
quite quickly all on their own.

44
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:45,766
I want the spells I'm missing
so I can keep going.

45
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:47,968
I want the new ones she stole
because I helped her.

46
00:01:48,003 --> 00:01:51,739
- You're not coming inside.
- Then bring 'em out.

47
00:01:51,774 --> 00:01:53,139
They're locked
in her filing cabinet,

48
00:01:53,175 --> 00:01:55,441
and even if I could, I wouldn't.

49
00:01:55,477 --> 00:01:57,244
I don't want
to see you get hurt,

50
00:01:57,279 --> 00:02:00,180
and Marina will hurt you.

51
00:02:00,215 --> 00:02:03,116
She only helped you get out of
Brakebills jail to save herself.

52
00:02:03,151 --> 00:02:05,518
Next time, you will not
be so lucky.

53
00:02:05,553 --> 00:02:07,921
That's bullshit.

54
00:02:07,956 --> 00:02:09,923
I earned that magic
just as much as her.

55
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:11,357
Fuck, more.

56
00:02:11,393 --> 00:02:14,460
- It was my friend that she used…
- Your friend!

57
00:02:17,231 --> 00:02:19,365
Look, Marina's the boss.
Life ain't fair.

58
00:02:19,401 --> 00:02:21,200
Woe is you. Now, please,

59
00:02:21,235 --> 00:02:23,770
leave before she sees you here.

60
00:02:30,144 --> 00:02:32,211
Think of it as applying
for an internship,

61
00:02:32,246 --> 00:02:34,880
and for outgoing students,
perhaps even a job.

62
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:38,322
Alumni come and choose
students to mentor.

63
00:02:39,253 --> 00:02:42,747
I can understand why you've
been staying here, Alice.

64
00:02:43,357 --> 00:02:45,824
I know you feel that
you've had to leave,

65
00:02:45,859 --> 00:02:49,394
but I'd really like you
to come back.

66
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,730
This is just one small corner
of the world.

67
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:53,331
There's a lot more
out there to see,

68
00:02:53,366 --> 00:02:55,148
and I'd like you to see it.

69
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:57,469
I don't much like the corners

70
00:02:57,504 --> 00:02:59,370
that I've already seen.

71
00:02:59,406 --> 00:03:03,408
Alice, students
leave every year,

72
00:03:03,443 --> 00:03:05,410
and I don't go searching
for every lost lamb.

73
00:03:05,445 --> 00:03:06,877
You didn't invite me.

74
00:03:06,913 --> 00:03:09,713
I had to sneak in
just to take the entrance exam.

75
00:03:09,749 --> 00:03:11,877
I made a mistake.

76
00:03:12,352 --> 00:03:15,219
I felt responsible for
what happened to your brother,

77
00:03:15,255 --> 00:03:17,988
and I didn't want to cause
your family another loss.

78
00:03:18,023 --> 00:03:20,324
Alice, I was wrong.

79
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:24,161
You are far too gifted
not to be with us.

80
00:03:24,196 --> 00:03:26,063
Just come back for a week,

81
00:03:26,098 --> 00:03:28,766
and if you don't like it,
then, please, by all means,

82
00:03:28,801 --> 00:03:31,034
be a farmhand.

83
00:03:33,372 --> 00:03:37,507
This year, we're going to win
the alumni week Hunger Games.

84
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:40,710
My mentor last year was a nun.
Never again.

85
00:03:40,745 --> 00:03:42,379
I specialize in feet.

86
00:03:42,414 --> 00:03:46,549
Broken bones, warts… I have some
very interesting stuff

87
00:03:46,585 --> 00:03:48,518
for fungi of the toenail.

88
00:03:48,553 --> 00:03:50,920
99% of these mentors

89
00:03:50,956 --> 00:03:55,558
lead to a lifetime of soporific
bourgeois magic hell.

90
00:03:58,062 --> 00:03:59,451
Alice.

91
00:04:00,765 --> 00:04:02,222
You're, uh…

92
00:04:03,434 --> 00:04:04,702
Hi.

93
00:04:05,103 --> 00:04:07,512
I'm going to get a drink.

94
00:04:10,508 --> 00:04:13,142
- Is Genji your aunt?
- Oh, hey, Alice.

95
00:04:13,177 --> 00:04:15,111
- Is that Genji?
- Do you guys know her?

96
00:04:15,146 --> 00:04:17,646
Everyone does.
She runs a retreat.

97
00:04:17,681 --> 00:04:19,648
It's like Camp David for magicians.

98
00:04:19,683 --> 00:04:21,950
If Camp David
was run by Caligula.

99
00:04:23,353 --> 00:04:26,221
I mean that in the best way.

100
00:04:26,256 --> 00:04:28,394
- Excuse me.
- Wa…

101
00:04:31,962 --> 00:04:35,230
I feel really terrible about, um…

102
00:04:35,265 --> 00:04:37,658
I just thought… I wouldn't be
standing here talking to me

103
00:04:37,856 --> 00:04:39,401
if I were you.

104
00:04:39,436 --> 00:04:41,141
I don't…

105
00:04:41,971 --> 00:04:44,239
I shouldn't blame you.

106
00:04:44,558 --> 00:04:47,808
The truth is,
my brother died five years ago.

107
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,477
Still, I…

108
00:04:49,513 --> 00:04:51,642
I should go help her.

109
00:05:05,461 --> 00:05:08,295
Can anybody hear me?

110
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,355
Anybody?

111
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,888
Anybody?

112
00:05:17,806 --> 00:05:18,983
Ah.

113
00:05:20,142 --> 00:05:21,318
Penny.

114
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,546
I'm Stanley.

115
00:05:25,581 --> 00:05:26,947
I'm your mentor.

116
00:05:26,982 --> 00:05:28,615
Yeah, I didn't ask for a mentor.

117
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,016
I don't give a shit.

118
00:05:30,052 --> 00:05:33,186
You are what you are,
so I'm here.

119
00:05:33,221 --> 00:05:34,454
What, a Pisces?

120
00:05:34,489 --> 00:05:36,322
Travelers are rare.

121
00:05:36,357 --> 00:05:37,791
Hadn't been one at Brakebills

122
00:05:37,826 --> 00:05:41,044
in 35 years, I guess.

123
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,563
There's no discipline

124
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:45,831
that has more power
and possibility.

125
00:05:45,866 --> 00:05:48,234
I get it. It's an amazing gift.

126
00:05:48,269 --> 00:05:52,271
It's a terrible,
life-destroying burden.

127
00:05:59,165 --> 00:06:01,581
I zapped myself
onto Mount Everest.

128
00:06:01,616 --> 00:06:03,548
Lost my leg to frostbite.

129
00:06:03,941 --> 00:06:06,485
I'd be dead if not for one

130
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,254
deeply confused Sherpa.

131
00:06:09,943 --> 00:06:11,657
Had the lecture yet on

132
00:06:11,692 --> 00:06:13,759
sticking with astral projection?

133
00:06:13,794 --> 00:06:15,360
I don't watch "Star Trek."

134
00:06:15,395 --> 00:06:17,930
Travelers' training wheels.

135
00:06:17,965 --> 00:06:20,932
Your body stays here;
your mind travels.

136
00:06:20,967 --> 00:06:22,700
It's like being a ghost.

137
00:06:22,981 --> 00:06:24,702
Meditating

138
00:06:24,738 --> 00:06:26,971
won't stop you
from having a wet dream

139
00:06:27,007 --> 00:06:29,412
and waking up
in the Marianas Trench.

140
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:31,743
This will.

141
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:37,749
It works by binding
your body to Earth.

142
00:06:37,784 --> 00:06:40,936
Astral projection only.

143
00:06:41,371 --> 00:06:43,020
Full stop.

144
00:06:46,938 --> 00:06:49,661
Won't make the voices go away,

145
00:06:49,696 --> 00:06:52,479
but it might keep you alive.

146
00:06:54,634 --> 00:06:58,068
How could you know about all
this and become a podiatrist?

147
00:06:58,442 --> 00:07:01,305
This isn't Middle Earth, Quentin.

148
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,341
There aren't enough
noble quests to go around.

149
00:07:04,377 --> 00:07:06,843
Impress a good mentor,
and you won't have to worry.

150
00:07:07,272 --> 00:07:08,745
How am I supposed
to impress anyone?

151
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:10,981
Mm, when you're not impressive?

152
00:07:11,016 --> 00:07:12,783
Glad you asked.

153
00:07:12,818 --> 00:07:15,418
Welters.

154
00:07:15,453 --> 00:07:17,154
- What's Welters?
- The worst.

155
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:19,455
It's a game
designed a billion years ago

156
00:07:19,491 --> 00:07:21,858
to keep students from
killing each other in duels.

157
00:07:21,894 --> 00:07:23,293
It's like chess.

158
00:07:23,328 --> 00:07:25,127
Kind of. Not really.

159
00:07:25,163 --> 00:07:28,531
You use magic to take squares.
It's terrible.

160
00:07:28,836 --> 00:07:29,965
I don't know.
That sounds kind of fun.

161
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:32,302
- It's boring as death.
- You're boring.

162
00:07:32,337 --> 00:07:34,937
- You're boring.
- There's gonna be a tournament.

163
00:07:34,972 --> 00:07:38,107
It's supposed to be a surprise,
but I like ruining things.

164
00:07:38,142 --> 00:07:40,142
Each discipline fields a team,

165
00:07:40,178 --> 00:07:42,277
and the mentors will be watching,

166
00:07:42,313 --> 00:07:45,715
so don't screw this up for me.

167
00:08:10,874 --> 00:08:12,874
Quentin.

168
00:08:16,213 --> 00:08:19,513
Someone called the admin
office and left a message.

169
00:08:28,643 --> 00:08:30,753
My dad's sick.

170
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,568
S01E05
Mendings, Major and Minor

171
00:08:40,801 --> 00:08:44,020
sync and corrected by ninh

172
00:08:52,446 --> 00:08:54,359
Hello, Curly Q.

173
00:08:55,749 --> 00:08:57,723
Hey, Dad.

174
00:09:00,254 --> 00:09:02,524
It's brain cancer,

175
00:09:02,989 --> 00:09:05,990
but it's the good kind
of brain cancer.

176
00:09:09,362 --> 00:09:11,229
Is there anything you can do?

177
00:09:11,264 --> 00:09:13,264
Well, luckily there are
some treatment options,

178
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:16,968
some, uh, really interesting
new therapies.

179
00:09:18,638 --> 00:09:20,444
Um, do you…

180
00:09:22,007 --> 00:09:23,474
Uh, do you feel sick?

181
00:09:23,808 --> 00:09:25,800
Eh, I feel…

182
00:09:26,145 --> 00:09:27,497
decent.

183
00:09:28,013 --> 00:09:30,814
Eh, there was some
dizziness, headaches.

184
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,906
That's why I went in.

185
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,153
- Does Mom know?
- No, she does not.

186
00:09:36,188 --> 00:09:37,933
As yet, I, uh…

187
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,158
I could come up with a reason,
I suppose,

188
00:09:41,193 --> 00:09:43,159
but the truth is, I just…

189
00:09:43,198 --> 00:09:46,196
I just don't want
to talk to her.

190
00:09:49,668 --> 00:09:51,615
I'm worried about you.

191
00:09:52,697 --> 00:09:54,638
You have brain cancer,
and you're worried about me?

192
00:09:54,673 --> 00:09:56,539
Will you stop saying "brain cancer"

193
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:59,008
like it's brain cancer?

194
00:10:02,886 --> 00:10:04,681
I never see you anymore

195
00:10:04,716 --> 00:10:07,716
since you went to this new school.

196
00:10:07,752 --> 00:10:10,186
Thinking a lot about mistakes,

197
00:10:10,221 --> 00:10:14,157
you know, things I would
do differently.

198
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:17,059
Quentin, by the time
you were ten years old,

199
00:10:17,095 --> 00:10:20,820
buddy, I couldn't sit through
one more card trick,

200
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:25,000
but if that's what makes
the world bearable to you,

201
00:10:25,035 --> 00:10:27,670
then you go off
and do card tricks.

202
00:10:27,705 --> 00:10:29,805
Don't try to be
something you're not.

203
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,174
You're studying what now?
Finance?

204
00:10:33,911 --> 00:10:36,011
You really a finance guy?

205
00:10:36,046 --> 00:10:38,647
- I'm not a kid anymore.
- Sure, yeah.

206
00:10:38,683 --> 00:10:40,982
Dump out that bag.
Go on. Dump it out.

207
00:10:41,018 --> 00:10:43,484
I'll give you 20 bucks right now
if there isn't a…

208
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,182
A "Fillory" book in there.

209
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,002
Yeah.

210
00:10:48,258 --> 00:10:51,259
You know you're still
on my insurance, right?

211
00:10:51,295 --> 00:10:53,862
You checked yourself
into a mental hospital

212
00:10:53,897 --> 00:10:56,264
a couple of months ago.
I didn't say a word.

213
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,599
I didn't say a word.
I gave you your space,

214
00:10:58,635 --> 00:11:00,568
but your prescriptions
are still coming here,

215
00:11:00,603 --> 00:11:02,837
which is how I know
you're not taking them.

216
00:11:02,872 --> 00:11:05,540
I don't need them.
I am… I'm better.

217
00:11:05,575 --> 00:11:07,742
I'm not trying
to pick a fight with you, son.

218
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:10,066
I'm just trying to…

219
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,012
fix what I broke.

220
00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:14,924
- You think I'm broken?
- No.

221
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,882
I think we are.

222
00:11:22,491 --> 00:11:24,424
Need a hand?

223
00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:27,761
We should catch up.

224
00:11:31,933 --> 00:11:34,331
I'm surprised you came back.

225
00:11:34,603 --> 00:11:36,703
I still haven't heard
about your walkabout.

226
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:38,271
Yeah, well, it wasn't
anything too exciting.

227
00:11:38,306 --> 00:11:40,139
I mostly fed
and killed chickens.

228
00:11:40,175 --> 00:11:42,743
I mean, I wanted you
to come back.

229
00:11:42,778 --> 00:11:44,444
We're friends, right?

230
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,447
Uh, I was wondering
if you could do me a tiny favor.

231
00:11:48,483 --> 00:11:50,984
I helped you find
Emily Greenstreet.

232
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:52,618
Right.

233
00:11:52,653 --> 00:11:56,155
See, I still haven't
been selected by a mentor yet.

234
00:11:56,191 --> 00:11:58,992
I still haven't been
selected by a mentor.

235
00:11:59,027 --> 00:12:01,094
We're such good friends,
I just…

236
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:03,128
I figured you could put
a good word in to your aunt.

237
00:12:03,163 --> 00:12:05,631
If you wouldn't mind
putting in a good word for me.

238
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,900
I just feel deeply
that we are connected

239
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,402
and are meant to work together.

240
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,643
I'll see what I can do.

241
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,289
Julia? Hey.

242
00:12:18,012 --> 00:12:20,412
- Hey.
- Sorry, I'm a little early.

243
00:12:20,447 --> 00:12:22,514
I knocked a couple times.

244
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:24,777
Um, working on this big paper.

245
00:12:25,687 --> 00:12:27,986
I baked.

246
00:12:33,727 --> 00:12:36,093
That's actually good.

247
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:38,830
It's, like, people food.

248
00:12:38,865 --> 00:12:40,731
What can I say?

249
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:45,036
You have no idea
how relieved I am

250
00:12:45,071 --> 00:12:47,038
to see you like this.

251
00:12:47,073 --> 00:12:48,940
Like what?

252
00:12:48,975 --> 00:12:50,207
A happy housewife?

253
00:12:50,243 --> 00:12:52,625
Better. Not, uh…

254
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:54,812
High all the time?

255
00:12:54,847 --> 00:12:57,548
I was gonna put it
a bit more delicately than that.

256
00:13:01,687 --> 00:13:03,117
Dad?

257
00:13:05,191 --> 00:13:07,404
Dad?

258
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,733
We need to go to the hospital.

259
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:19,470
No, they'll just send me home.

260
00:13:19,505 --> 00:13:22,506
I'm fine.
They need to adjust your meds.

261
00:13:22,696 --> 00:13:25,388
I'm not taking any meds, Quentin.

262
00:13:26,744 --> 00:13:28,578
How bad is it?

263
00:13:28,613 --> 00:13:31,414
I have a glioblastoma.

264
00:13:33,051 --> 00:13:36,219
It's the most common type
of brain tumor.

265
00:13:37,855 --> 00:13:39,489
It's also the most severe.

266
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:41,257
But it's treatable?

267
00:13:41,293 --> 00:13:42,692
There are treatments available.

268
00:13:42,727 --> 00:13:45,795
I chose not to pursue them.

269
00:13:52,883 --> 00:13:54,604
You know, I Googled brain tumors

270
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,573
just in general,

271
00:13:57,609 --> 00:13:59,741
and one common denominator
that jumps out at you

272
00:13:59,776 --> 00:14:01,243
is impaired cognitive function,

273
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:04,213
so maybe you deciding
not to pursue treatment

274
00:14:04,248 --> 00:14:08,146
- without talking…
- My doctors agree with me, Q.

275
00:14:08,652 --> 00:14:12,587
The type of tumor it is,
where it's located…

276
00:14:12,816 --> 00:14:15,415
the person who comes
out of surgery…

277
00:14:16,793 --> 00:14:18,512
might not be me.

278
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,094
I don't want you to die.

279
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:23,431
Yeah, I'm not too crazy
about it myself.

280
00:14:23,466 --> 00:14:25,530
Then why are you giving up?

281
00:14:38,969 --> 00:14:40,948
You remember this?

282
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:49,322
My dad and I used to build
model airplanes.

283
00:14:51,961 --> 00:14:53,561
And this,

284
00:14:53,596 --> 00:14:56,163
this was my absolute favorite.

285
00:14:56,198 --> 00:14:58,029
Tenth birthday.

286
00:14:58,634 --> 00:15:01,101
This is a Nieuport 28.

287
00:15:01,136 --> 00:15:02,803
It's the same plane
Quentin Roosevelt flew

288
00:15:02,838 --> 00:15:04,904
in World War I.

289
00:15:06,175 --> 00:15:09,295
When you were
about two years old,

290
00:15:09,811 --> 00:15:11,144
you got your hands on this,

291
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,907
and you broke off
one of the wings.

292
00:15:15,684 --> 00:15:18,585
I spent about an hour
with a hot glue gun

293
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,382
trying to fix it.

294
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:22,816
It ended up in

295
00:15:23,058 --> 00:15:25,625
about 20 pieces instead of 2.

296
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,064
Quentin,

297
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:30,663
sometimes trying to fix
something only makes it worse.

298
00:15:35,036 --> 00:15:37,803
They match my 401k up to 6%.

299
00:15:37,838 --> 00:15:40,468
- It's just… it's crazy.
- Dr. Meers?

300
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:43,700
Oh, excuse me.

301
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:46,845
My father's dying,

302
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,911
and I need you to fix him.

303
00:15:49,775 --> 00:15:52,097
If magicians could cure cancer

304
00:15:52,189 --> 00:15:54,355
why would anybody have cancer?

305
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:57,025
Because we like secrets.

306
00:15:58,661 --> 00:16:00,461
There's got to be
some kind of spell.

307
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,296
Amazing things are possible,

308
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,398
but cancer,

309
00:16:04,534 --> 00:16:06,367
it's a part of you,

310
00:16:06,402 --> 00:16:07,869
intrinsically, in a way

311
00:16:07,904 --> 00:16:11,205
that magic can't separate.

312
00:16:11,241 --> 00:16:14,006
Some people think it is magic,

313
00:16:14,968 --> 00:16:17,511
an old curse we can't break.

314
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,714
So then, somebody
must have tried.

315
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:21,449
I mean, look, even
if it's experimental, I…

316
00:16:21,484 --> 00:16:24,785
Do you know why Dean Fogg
didn't fix his eyes?

317
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,554
I guess I just assumed
he couldn't.

318
00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:27,855
Treating something like that

319
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:31,632
requires an enormous amount
of energy,

320
00:16:32,094 --> 00:16:34,128
and that comes at a cost.

321
00:16:34,163 --> 00:16:36,368
So does everything.

322
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:40,576
I can give you the names
of some journal articles.

323
00:16:41,804 --> 00:16:43,403
Thank you.

324
00:16:43,438 --> 00:16:45,405
Fair warning…

325
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,408
what you're looking for
might be impossible,

326
00:16:48,443 --> 00:16:49,942
and it will require

327
00:16:49,978 --> 00:16:52,979
far more energy
than you can muster.

328
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,323
I love you.

329
00:17:04,744 --> 00:17:06,558
Oh…

330
00:17:06,594 --> 00:17:09,095
you baked.

331
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:12,165
You can have one,
if you think you can afford it.

332
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,669
Please, I have the metabolism
of a Jamaican sprinter,

333
00:17:16,704 --> 00:17:19,405
and I need my strength

334
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,309
so I can properly wrap this
bottle of double charmed sake

335
00:17:23,344 --> 00:17:27,446
you can only get from a very
particular monk on Okinawa.

336
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:32,984
But I'm sure Genji is gonna
love your little cakes.

337
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:42,294
This is war, bitch.

338
00:18:24,572 --> 00:18:25,680
Ow.

339
00:18:25,786 --> 00:18:28,805
You should know better
than to mess with Google magic,

340
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:31,808
and starting an invisible fire
in your apartment,

341
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,810
still a fire.

342
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,712
You got lucky.

343
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,414
Pete,

344
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,516
there's nothing else
for me to be besides this.

345
00:18:40,551 --> 00:18:44,220
There's a whole world
of things besides this.

346
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,189
I almost burned down
my apartment,

347
00:18:46,224 --> 00:18:48,512
and all I can think about
is trying it again.

348
00:18:48,631 --> 00:18:51,027
Pete, there is nothing else.

349
00:18:52,563 --> 00:18:55,865
Your boyfriend could have
done this for you.

350
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,867
I just got this stuff at Target.

351
00:18:57,902 --> 00:18:59,535
Not that I'm complaining.

352
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:02,438
You know, a beautiful girl calls you
in the middle of the night,

353
00:19:02,473 --> 00:19:05,107
never mind she's
a little intense…

354
00:19:07,311 --> 00:19:08,841
You answer.

355
00:19:34,443 --> 00:19:37,271
There are other hedges

356
00:19:37,504 --> 00:19:39,273
and other safe houses.

357
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:41,462
I want to know where.

358
00:20:01,697 --> 00:20:03,327
Quentin?

359
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:05,781
Quentin!

360
00:20:06,335 --> 00:20:07,901
Where have you been?

361
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:11,137
You're late,
and this is mandatory!

362
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:16,443
Welters is a game of circumstances.

363
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:18,111
Simply put,

364
00:20:18,146 --> 00:20:21,581
we beat that squad
of flower-power ass-clowns

365
00:20:21,616 --> 00:20:24,650
by casting
to capture those squares,

366
00:20:24,686 --> 00:20:27,087
but the squares
won't make that easy.

367
00:20:27,122 --> 00:20:30,190
Each one represents
a different location

368
00:20:30,225 --> 00:20:32,192
and a different
set of circumstances,

369
00:20:32,227 --> 00:20:34,260
so you can't just cast.

370
00:20:34,296 --> 00:20:35,928
You actually have to know
how to cast

371
00:20:35,964 --> 00:20:37,697
for those complications,

372
00:20:37,732 --> 00:20:40,600
then adjust in a dozen ways.

373
00:20:40,635 --> 00:20:42,835
If you get any one of them wrong,

374
00:20:42,871 --> 00:20:44,704
the whole thing goes to hell.

375
00:21:16,904 --> 00:21:18,703
Will you stop
saying "brain cancer"

376
00:21:18,739 --> 00:21:21,706
like it's brain cancer?

377
00:21:21,742 --> 00:21:24,342
Sometimes trying to fix
something only makes it worse.

378
00:21:24,377 --> 00:21:26,177
- Quentin.
- Quentin.

379
00:21:26,212 --> 00:21:28,012
- Quentin.
- Quentin.

380
00:21:28,048 --> 00:21:30,014
Quentin!

381
00:21:33,053 --> 00:21:35,986
Get your head out of your twat
and throw the damn globe.

382
00:21:52,168 --> 00:21:53,737
Are you okay?

383
00:21:53,923 --> 00:21:55,479
I'm fine.

384
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,550
Oh!

385
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:19,128
Are you sure
you want to do that?

386
00:22:42,953 --> 00:22:45,921
Q, are you controlling this?

387
00:22:45,956 --> 00:22:48,090
Do something, Q!

388
00:23:11,096 --> 00:23:14,601
One spell so powerful,
it wiped the whole board.

389
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:15,852
To Quentin!

390
00:23:19,797 --> 00:23:22,104
Q, come on. Celebrate.

391
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,006
Who knew you had it in you?

392
00:23:24,042 --> 00:23:27,310
Easily worth whatever it's gonna
cost to replace the roof.

393
00:23:27,346 --> 00:23:28,744
I don't care.

394
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:30,947
I get your dad is sick,

395
00:23:30,982 --> 00:23:34,683
but like it or not, you still
have to think about your future,

396
00:23:34,719 --> 00:23:36,118
and this matters for that.

397
00:23:36,154 --> 00:23:37,519
One of the mentors
came up to me after the game

398
00:23:37,555 --> 00:23:38,855
and asked me to come
to the Fertile Crescent

399
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,656
to stalk a river dragon.

400
00:23:40,691 --> 00:23:43,125
I said no, 'cause grand scheme,

401
00:23:43,161 --> 00:23:44,593
none of that matters.

402
00:23:44,628 --> 00:23:47,295
Why do you think
you were able to do that?

403
00:23:47,331 --> 00:23:49,531
Please tell me someone
has pointed out to you

404
00:23:49,567 --> 00:23:52,668
that magic doesn't come
from sunshine and ice cream,

405
00:23:52,703 --> 00:23:54,703
for any of us.

406
00:23:57,241 --> 00:23:59,508
What you're born with,

407
00:23:59,543 --> 00:24:02,210
what gets slammed
on you as a kid,

408
00:24:02,246 --> 00:24:04,645
what happens now,
like your dad…

409
00:24:07,684 --> 00:24:11,052
A great way
to get the things you want

410
00:24:11,088 --> 00:24:13,993
is to be so miserable,

411
00:24:14,258 --> 00:24:16,342
you don't want them anymore.

412
00:24:16,593 --> 00:24:18,967
What kind of system is that?

413
00:24:19,763 --> 00:24:21,953
You know, why can't it run on…

414
00:24:22,164 --> 00:24:24,038
love…

415
00:24:24,434 --> 00:24:27,301
or cocaine or something?

416
00:24:29,672 --> 00:24:32,560
It's the universe deep-dicking us.

417
00:24:33,109 --> 00:24:35,409
Lie back and try and enjoy it.

418
00:24:46,889 --> 00:24:49,223
- Hi there.
- Hello.

419
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:53,159
- Pete sent me.
- Uh…

420
00:24:54,696 --> 00:24:57,697
- Show us your stars.
- I can do you one better.

421
00:25:02,738 --> 00:25:04,604
Um…

422
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,440
Uh, yeah. Um…

423
00:25:06,663 --> 00:25:08,180
Welcome.

424
00:25:10,578 --> 00:25:13,272
So… what's your name?

425
00:25:17,218 --> 00:25:19,185
Wa… this is it?

426
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,687
- How do you mean?
- This is all you have?

427
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:25,558
Well, if you know so much,
why don't you show us?

428
00:25:25,593 --> 00:25:28,243
No, I didn't come here to teach.

429
00:25:29,163 --> 00:25:31,950
At least show us that
cool cloud thing again?

430
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,534
Oh, my God.

431
00:25:38,138 --> 00:25:40,038
What day of the week is it?

432
00:25:40,074 --> 00:25:42,807
Ah, you are asking
the wrong guy.

433
00:25:51,251 --> 00:25:53,218
What is this?

434
00:25:57,086 --> 00:25:59,390
You joining the navy?

435
00:26:01,461 --> 00:26:02,824
Hey…

436
00:26:03,697 --> 00:26:05,437
what's wrong?

437
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,094
It's to stop myself from
traveling to an early grave.

438
00:26:12,825 --> 00:26:14,905
Come on,
you're looking at it all wrong.

439
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,242
Look, every idiot on the planet

440
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:20,511
busts their ass. For what?

441
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:24,015
To buy the freedom
that you got for free.

442
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:26,417
It's not free if I can't control it.

443
00:26:26,452 --> 00:26:28,919
Well, then figure out how.

444
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:32,188
If you do, you could go
anywhere, any time.

445
00:26:32,366 --> 00:26:34,658
I mean, look, not for nothing,

446
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:38,028
but you could be the
greatest thief who ever lived.

447
00:26:39,532 --> 00:26:41,258
I'm serious.

448
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:45,301
- Come on.
- What am I gonna steal?

449
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:47,653
Hmm, well…

450
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,939
Could start by stealing me
a sandwich.

451
00:26:54,922 --> 00:26:56,279
The day drinking losers

452
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:59,549
absolutely do not fulfill
the terms of our agreement.

453
00:27:00,985 --> 00:27:02,711
Our agreement?

454
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,257
I want somewhere better,

455
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:07,830
some place with real magic.

456
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:12,327
Please.

457
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:16,298
It's the number two
safe house in the city.

458
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:18,067
What? In all of New York?

459
00:27:18,102 --> 00:27:21,703
- A city of 8 million people?
- They got good magic.

460
00:27:21,738 --> 00:27:23,338
It's not their fault that

461
00:27:23,374 --> 00:27:24,806
they're the tortoise
and you're the hare.

462
00:27:24,841 --> 00:27:26,175
They're not even in the race.

463
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:28,043
Look, you want something better,

464
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,879
get out of town;
go to where the talent is.

465
00:27:30,914 --> 00:27:33,748
You think the safe house
in Hoboken's gonna be better?

466
00:27:35,886 --> 00:27:39,253
There's this place
in the Mali desert.

467
00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:42,657
The marabouts have
this object magic

468
00:27:42,693 --> 00:27:44,740
like nothing we have here.

469
00:27:45,762 --> 00:27:47,286
We could go.

470
00:27:47,564 --> 00:27:49,701
- Together.
- Oh.

471
00:27:50,133 --> 00:27:51,323
Can't.

472
00:27:51,935 --> 00:27:53,463
Why?

473
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:55,936
Because I love my boyfriend.

474
00:27:55,972 --> 00:27:59,044
You slept with me two days ago.

475
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:01,115
You're welcome.

476
00:28:01,611 --> 00:28:05,179
That's a pretty loose fucking
definition of love.

477
00:28:05,215 --> 00:28:07,515
What, you think that
you and James

478
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:10,417
are gonna grow old together?

479
00:28:10,452 --> 00:28:12,953
He doesn't know the most
important thing about you.

480
00:28:12,989 --> 00:28:14,287
- Then I'll tell him.
- You can't.

481
00:28:14,323 --> 00:28:16,288
Why? Marina's rules?

482
00:28:16,324 --> 00:28:19,258
Because it's dangerous,
for both of you.

483
00:28:19,293 --> 00:28:20,860
Marina's rules no longer apply.

484
00:28:20,895 --> 00:28:22,695
Julia, you're making a mistake.

485
00:28:22,731 --> 00:28:24,909
Give me spells, and I won't do it.

486
00:28:26,018 --> 00:28:27,640
Right.

487
00:28:45,217 --> 00:28:46,956
Please help.

488
00:28:47,115 --> 00:28:48,474
Okay, I hear you.

489
00:28:48,579 --> 00:28:50,088
Please help me.

490
00:28:51,983 --> 00:28:53,825
Please come for me.

491
00:28:55,716 --> 00:28:57,627
Please help.

492
00:28:57,663 --> 00:29:00,830
- Who the fuck are you?
- Let me out of here!

493
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:02,598
- Lady!
- Someone help me.

494
00:29:02,634 --> 00:29:04,534
Come on, can you hear me?

495
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:17,112
Please help! Please help me!

496
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:21,511
Let me out of here.

497
00:29:22,253 --> 00:29:25,349
You can't keep doing this to me.

498
00:29:28,752 --> 00:29:30,204
Whoa.

499
00:29:31,364 --> 00:29:33,364
Okay.

500
00:29:34,122 --> 00:29:36,633
Astral projection.

501
00:29:38,704 --> 00:29:40,948
All right, safety first.

502
00:29:44,734 --> 00:29:46,410
Please.

503
00:29:46,502 --> 00:29:48,573
- Help.
- Hello?

504
00:29:50,248 --> 00:29:51,682
Hello?

505
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:05,861
No…

506
00:30:05,897 --> 00:30:07,530
Let me out of here!

507
00:30:07,565 --> 00:30:11,734
You sound talkative today, Victoria.

508
00:30:13,563 --> 00:30:15,771
Are you ready to talk?

509
00:30:18,246 --> 00:30:20,370
I can wait all day.

510
00:30:36,645 --> 00:30:38,111
Hey!

511
00:30:38,147 --> 00:30:39,973
You lied to me.

512
00:30:41,622 --> 00:30:43,815
First one in 35 years?

513
00:30:44,086 --> 00:30:46,586
Yes, there was a girl
several years ago.

514
00:30:46,621 --> 00:30:48,120
Yeah, well, I saw her,

515
00:30:48,156 --> 00:30:50,456
while I was astral ghosting
into some dungeon.

516
00:30:50,492 --> 00:30:52,325
Turns out she's part of that

517
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,394
incredibly famous third year class,

518
00:30:54,429 --> 00:30:56,996
the missing third year class.

519
00:30:57,031 --> 00:30:59,932
I didn't know
what happened to her.

520
00:30:59,967 --> 00:31:02,067
I figured she was dead.

521
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:07,505
You're supposed to be
my fucking mentor.

522
00:31:08,009 --> 00:31:10,403
What the hell
do you want from me?

523
00:31:11,378 --> 00:31:12,805
Christ!

524
00:31:14,849 --> 00:31:17,683
- Can you get her back?
- Can I?

525
00:31:17,718 --> 00:31:19,118
I don't know where
the hell she is.

526
00:31:19,153 --> 00:31:20,652
You're the one who saw her,

527
00:31:20,688 --> 00:31:22,975
and it's not my problem.

528
00:31:23,557 --> 00:31:25,457
My advice?

529
00:31:25,492 --> 00:31:28,120
Get that tattoo
as soon as possible.

530
00:31:34,968 --> 00:31:39,170
♪ No more smoke
on the dance floor ♪

531
00:31:39,404 --> 00:31:40,671
What's your poison?

532
00:31:40,707 --> 00:31:43,875
Um, I don't know.
I just poured something.

533
00:31:44,786 --> 00:31:45,609
Yuck.

534
00:31:45,645 --> 00:31:48,313
I have so much to teach you
about drinking.

535
00:31:48,348 --> 00:31:50,481
It's a three-year program.
Graduate level.

536
00:31:50,516 --> 00:31:52,688
It begins immediately.

537
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,685
Relax.

538
00:31:54,721 --> 00:31:58,055
This isn't some mentor week
full-court press.

539
00:31:58,387 --> 00:32:00,491
- Oh.
- Yeah.

540
00:32:00,526 --> 00:32:04,662
Friends don't let friends drink
Long Island iced tea, Alice.

541
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,633
Eliot, I… oh, sorry.

542
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:11,235
Sorry.

543
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:14,238
Um, Alice, do you mind if I just
borrow Eliot for a second?

544
00:32:14,273 --> 00:32:15,719
Mm.

545
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:18,708
How may I help you, sir?

546
00:32:18,744 --> 00:32:21,220
What do you know
about Cancer Puppy?

547
00:32:21,747 --> 00:32:23,186
Okay.

548
00:32:24,683 --> 00:32:25,815
Okay.

549
00:32:25,851 --> 00:32:29,352
Oh, yes.

550
00:32:29,388 --> 00:32:30,987
His name is Gerald,

551
00:32:31,022 --> 00:32:33,656
but everyone calls him
Cancer Puppy.

552
00:32:33,692 --> 00:32:36,726
He's sort of our
unofficial mascot.

553
00:32:36,762 --> 00:32:38,261
Why does he have cancer?

554
00:32:38,296 --> 00:32:40,997
Because he's 150, Quentin.

555
00:32:41,032 --> 00:32:42,899
The enchantment just
keeps him a puppy forever;

556
00:32:42,934 --> 00:32:44,700
it doesn't stop him
from being riddled

557
00:32:44,735 --> 00:32:47,103
with every single disease it's
possible to be riddled with.

558
00:32:47,138 --> 00:32:50,539
They've been taking him to
a very confused veterinarian

559
00:32:50,574 --> 00:32:53,283
in Ogdensburg. Yes.

560
00:32:56,414 --> 00:32:57,887
Hi.

561
00:32:59,417 --> 00:33:01,700
What if I could fix you?

562
00:33:02,085 --> 00:33:05,086
You're going to cure
Cancer Puppy?

563
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:08,624
I found a spell that might work,

564
00:33:08,659 --> 00:33:10,956
but it requires a lot of energy,

565
00:33:12,329 --> 00:33:14,596
and I think I might
have that right now.

566
00:33:25,242 --> 00:33:26,732
A little.

567
00:33:38,621 --> 00:33:40,219
Hi.

568
00:33:42,172 --> 00:33:44,459
Okay.

569
00:33:45,087 --> 00:33:46,290
Okay.

570
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,442
Oh, no.

571
00:34:01,477 --> 00:34:03,775
You killed Cancer Puppy?

572
00:34:04,197 --> 00:34:06,546
I was trying to cure him.

573
00:34:08,116 --> 00:34:10,750
The spell you were
attempting to cast is part of

574
00:34:10,786 --> 00:34:13,186
a class of magic strictly
forbidden for all students.

575
00:34:13,221 --> 00:34:15,622
It is also strictly forbidden
for everyone else.

576
00:34:15,657 --> 00:34:17,491
- I was just…
- The best magicians

577
00:34:17,526 --> 00:34:19,425
in the world couldn't work
that spell, and yet you thought

578
00:34:19,461 --> 00:34:21,160
a middling
first year student could.

579
00:34:21,196 --> 00:34:23,101
I had to try.

580
00:34:32,177 --> 00:34:33,536
Why didn't you fix your eyes?

581
00:34:33,602 --> 00:34:36,642
The glasses show me outlines.
I can live with that.

582
00:34:36,677 --> 00:34:39,378
If I had to choose between
my eyes or my hands,

583
00:34:39,413 --> 00:34:41,865
I'd rather be able to cast.

584
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:46,484
It's on the first page of your
first textbook, Quentin.

585
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,319
"As magicians,

586
00:34:48,354 --> 00:34:50,388
"we are the instrument
and the medium.

587
00:34:50,423 --> 00:34:52,390
We are the chisel
and the marble."

588
00:34:52,425 --> 00:34:54,526
- I read it. I just…
- But you didn't listen,

589
00:34:54,561 --> 00:34:55,894
did you?

590
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:59,230
Yes, you can
save someone's eyes.

591
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:00,798
You can even save
someone's life,

592
00:35:00,834 --> 00:35:03,734
but you might alter
their soul in the process.

593
00:35:04,293 --> 00:35:06,029
Then why bother?

594
00:35:07,072 --> 00:35:09,140
What is the point
of any of this, of magic,

595
00:35:09,175 --> 00:35:11,675
if we can't fix real problems?

596
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:15,712
We can fix some things.

597
00:35:17,016 --> 00:35:19,262
So we fix what we can.

598
00:35:22,755 --> 00:35:25,088
Get rid of the flare!

599
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,223
Get the kids!

600
00:35:27,259 --> 00:35:29,225
Get rid of the flare!

601
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,830
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord be with you.

602
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:43,210
Dad?

603
00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:50,053
- Dad?
- Yeah…

604
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,518
Hmm? It's okay.

605
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:58,921
I'm just, uh…
I'm just a little tired.

606
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:02,692
Curly Q,

607
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,700
what's going on?

608
00:36:06,244 --> 00:36:08,051
You were right.

609
00:36:08,665 --> 00:36:10,532
You do know your kid,

610
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:12,568
at least a little.

611
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:15,497
I could give a shit about finance.

612
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:20,609
You know I just
want you to be happy.

613
00:36:20,644 --> 00:36:22,578
I know. I get that. I do.

614
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:24,245
Come on.

615
00:37:09,344 --> 00:37:10,991
This is where I've been.

616
00:37:17,581 --> 00:37:19,299
I'm a magician.

617
00:37:27,937 --> 00:37:30,219
Hot stuff, hey.

618
00:37:31,179 --> 00:37:33,345
You usually get me a scone too.

619
00:37:34,322 --> 00:37:35,314
Um…

620
00:37:35,349 --> 00:37:37,817
I tried calling,

621
00:37:37,852 --> 00:37:40,186
like, a lot. Uh, anyways,

622
00:37:40,221 --> 00:37:43,790
listen, uh, 'cause this
is important, so…

623
00:37:43,825 --> 00:37:46,625
Okay, let me stop you
one quick second.

624
00:37:46,661 --> 00:37:48,862
Do I know you?

625
00:37:49,697 --> 00:37:52,331
- This isn't funny.
- I'm sorry.

626
00:37:52,366 --> 00:37:55,168
I think you have me
confused for someone else.

627
00:37:56,498 --> 00:37:58,860
Um, sorry.

628
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,673
Little problem out here.

629
00:38:13,862 --> 00:38:16,067
Pete! Now, fucker!

630
00:38:17,146 --> 00:38:18,503
What're you thinking?

631
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:19,886
Marina could be back any second.

632
00:38:19,928 --> 00:38:21,395
You need to leave now.

633
00:38:21,448 --> 00:38:23,664
- You're pathetic.
- I'm really not.

634
00:38:23,685 --> 00:38:25,342
What is this,
some sort of sick revenge

635
00:38:25,406 --> 00:38:26,820
because I wouldn't
screw you again?

636
00:38:26,856 --> 00:38:28,155
I didn't do anything.

637
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,990
No, of course you didn't.
Marina did.

638
00:38:30,026 --> 00:38:31,491
You couldn't get it up
for this kind of magic

639
00:38:31,527 --> 00:38:32,559
even if you wanted to.

640
00:38:32,594 --> 00:38:33,861
You sold me out!

641
00:38:33,896 --> 00:38:35,828
It wasn't to hurt you!

642
00:38:35,864 --> 00:38:38,431
It was to save James from you

643
00:38:38,467 --> 00:38:39,932
because you're out of control.

644
00:38:40,205 --> 00:38:41,268
You want everybody's help.

645
00:38:41,303 --> 00:38:42,935
You want to stand
on our shoulders,

646
00:38:42,971 --> 00:38:46,606
and you haven't, not once,
taken any of our advice.

647
00:38:46,642 --> 00:38:49,347
No wonder they didn't
let you into Brakebills.

648
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:01,620
I gave it a shot.
I tried to get into alumni week.

649
00:39:01,656 --> 00:39:03,222
I just… I'm sorry.

650
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:06,025
I don't care about becoming
a magical podiatrist

651
00:39:06,061 --> 00:39:10,097
or cataloging cryptids,
throwing huge parties.

652
00:39:10,798 --> 00:39:13,165
Honestly…
What do you care about?

653
00:39:15,069 --> 00:39:17,403
I don't know.
I'm still figuring that out.

654
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:20,671
Well, then this is
the perfect place to be.

655
00:39:21,242 --> 00:39:22,474
Oh…

656
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:26,106
Charlie would be
so proud, sweetheart,

657
00:39:26,446 --> 00:39:29,781
and you can always run away
to me whenever you like.

658
00:39:30,423 --> 00:39:33,312
What are these two staring at?

659
00:39:33,523 --> 00:39:34,385
Quick, here she comes.

660
00:39:34,421 --> 00:39:37,055
Get ready for the first spanking
you won't enjoy.

661
00:39:37,091 --> 00:39:38,959
That's actually kind of hot.

662
00:39:41,127 --> 00:39:44,128
Dears, while you are both
quite impressive,

663
00:39:44,163 --> 00:39:47,265
honestly, the thought
of working with you exhausts me,

664
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,268
and I'm too vain to sacrifice
my looks in that way.

665
00:39:50,303 --> 00:39:53,271
No, no, I mean,
we totally get it.

666
00:39:54,482 --> 00:39:55,740
Maybe next year?

667
00:39:55,775 --> 00:39:57,463
Sure.

668
00:40:03,465 --> 00:40:05,378
Well…

669
00:40:05,684 --> 00:40:07,985
What do we need her for anyway?

670
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,087
We can start our own
bed-and-breakfast.

671
00:40:10,123 --> 00:40:11,508
Retreat.

672
00:40:11,791 --> 00:40:13,490
Hotel.

673
00:40:13,525 --> 00:40:15,024
- Bathhouse?
- Mm.

674
00:40:18,364 --> 00:40:20,830
Helps if you hold
a pleasant image in mind,

675
00:40:20,866 --> 00:40:23,199
such as a baby,

676
00:40:23,235 --> 00:40:25,034
if you tolerate those.

677
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:28,338
Circumstances are more favorable
on a waxing moon.

678
00:40:28,374 --> 00:40:30,106
That's not to say
that it can't be done.

679
00:40:30,142 --> 00:40:33,280
It's cooperative, so partner up.

680
00:40:40,152 --> 00:40:42,085
Lab partners?

681
00:40:50,561 --> 00:40:52,234
About your dad…

682
00:40:53,498 --> 00:40:54,897
Yeah.

683
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:01,245
Well, can they fix him?

684
00:41:02,538 --> 00:41:04,072
Can we fix him?

685
00:41:07,123 --> 00:41:08,707
Quentin?

686
00:41:10,247 --> 00:41:12,247
You can get through this.

687
00:41:18,055 --> 00:41:20,585
I wasn't sure
if you were gonna, um…

688
00:41:21,558 --> 00:41:22,828
I…

689
00:41:24,294 --> 00:41:26,244
I'm glad you came back.

690
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,074
Looks like "Game of Thrones" fan art.

691
00:41:40,109 --> 00:41:42,543
Super helpful.

692
00:41:42,578 --> 00:41:45,744
You should ask
Quentin and Alice.

693
00:41:46,082 --> 00:41:48,858
- Hell no.
- It saw you.

694
00:41:50,086 --> 00:41:51,839
Penny, they're involved.

695
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:54,029
Fu…

696
00:41:55,296 --> 00:41:58,559
All I can say is
it was some kind of dungeon.

697
00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:00,927
This was on the walls.

698
00:42:00,963 --> 00:42:02,896
It's a…

699
00:42:10,272 --> 00:42:12,405
That's Ember's seal.

Uh…

701
00:42:30,677 --> 00:42:32,841

Marina is a psycho.

cut you off from magic?

- You don't know cut off.

They're locked

- You can move between worlds.

Had the lecture yet on
sticking with astral projection?

15
00:00:29,973 --> 00:00:32,006
It works by binding your body

You were in Fillory.

- Stop!

- Okay? Fillory is just a--
- Did you see any animals?

24
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:01,489
- Did they talk to you?
- I was at some dungeon,

00:01:01,591 --> 00:01:02,890
you Hobbit-loving freak.

26
00:01:02,992 --> 00:01:03,992
What's wrong with you?

27
00:01:04,093 --> 00:01:05,158
There are no Hobbits in Fillory.

28
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,494
It--It doesn't matter.

29
00:01:06,596 --> 00:01:08,161
Ah, the drawing, the crest,
it means that you were

30
00:01:08,263 --> 00:01:09,697
in a certain Fillorian castle.

31
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:11,832
- Kill me.
- It was built by dwarves.

32
00:01:11,934 --> 00:01:14,034
Ah, okay, let's not get
caught up in the details.

33
00:01:14,136 --> 00:01:17,471
The--the point is that
the--it's full of a--

34
00:01:17,572 --> 00:01:19,339
a ton of incredibly
magical shit.

35
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:21,441
Oh, yeah, The Beast
is really fucking magical.

36
00:01:21,543 --> 00:01:22,544
Let me pop back over there

37
00:01:22,644 --> 00:01:25,045
and see if he does
birthday parties.

38
00:01:25,147 --> 00:01:27,347
Let's go.
It's a waste of time.

39
00:01:27,449 --> 00:01:29,249
I think you should listen
to Quentin.

40
00:01:29,351 --> 00:01:30,884
Because I'm assuming
you didn't travel to Fillory

41
00:01:30,986 --> 00:01:34,120
on some planned vacation.

42
00:01:34,222 --> 00:01:36,155
So you don't know
how to control it yet.

43
00:01:36,257 --> 00:01:38,391
Then educate yourself.

44
00:01:38,493 --> 00:01:41,728
Nobody knows more about Fillory
than Quentin.

45
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,329
What if you end up back
there again?

46
00:01:43,431 --> 00:01:45,532

How's that, if I was right
there staring him in the face?

54

get chased around

Ah, it's sort of surrealist.

Okay, I take it back.
This is a waste of your time.

59
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:12,724
The books were written for kids,

60
00:02:12,826 --> 00:02:14,061
so maybe they skipped
the monster

00:00:09,204 --> 00:00:12,054
Holy shit.
I'm doing this.

6
00:00:14,367 --> 00:00:16,637
Quentin Coldwater.

7
00:00:16,672 --> 00:00:19,043
There you are.

8
00:00:19,077 --> 00:00:21,080
All we can do is…

9
00:00:21,081 --> 00:00:24,854
make them Magicians.

10
00:00:24,889 --> 00:00:26,357
That's not enough.

11
00:00:26,358 --> 00:00:27,727
Marina didn't betray my mom.

12
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:29,363
She cleaned up her mess.

13
00:00:29,364 --> 00:00:30,866
<i>Cut to now Marina has to demand</i>

14
00:00:30,867 --> 00:00:33,004
<i>that I steal shit
ten times a week.</i>

15
00:00:33,005 --> 00:00:35,343
Wait, you know who
has a ton of new stuff?

16
00:00:35,344 --> 00:00:36,345
<i>Marina.</i>

17
00:00:37,381 --> 00:00:38,716
Run!

18
00:00:41,054 --> 00:00:43,258
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

19
00:00:43,259 --> 00:00:46,098
You are a traveler.

20
00:00:46,132 --> 00:00:50,302
<i>It's a terrible,
life-destroying burden.</i>

21
00:00:52,411 --> 00:00:54,615
I designed it myself.

22
00:00:54,649 --> 00:00:57,621
<i>Works by binding
your body to Earth.</i>

23
00:00:57,622 --> 00:01:00,126
<i>You must bare yourself
in the presence</i>

24
00:01:00,127 --> 00:01:02,130
<i>of another magical adept</i>

25
00:01:02,131 --> 00:01:05,470
<i>and expose your utmost truth.</i>

26
00:01:05,505 --> 00:01:06,939
I'm falling in love with you.

27
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,343
I only flirted with you
that first day

28
00:01:08,344 --> 00:01:10,147
because you looked useful,
and you were.

29
00:01:10,148 --> 00:01:13,086
We stole a lot of shit.
So there it is.

30
00:01:13,087 --> 00:01:14,797
It's all a lie.

31
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,829
Hey!

32
00:01:17,863 --> 00:01:19,098
Alice, I-

33
00:01:19,132 --> 00:01:22,271
ugh!

34
00:02:09,134 --> 00:02:10,235
M.E. thinks it was
some kind of

35
00:02:10,236 --> 00:02:12,206
very rare brain hemorrhage.

36
00:02:12,207 --> 00:02:13,709
Your friend have a history
of that kind of thing?

37
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,281
She wasn't my friend.

38
00:02:16,315 --> 00:02:18,586
Then why are you crying?

39
00:02:18,587 --> 00:02:20,723
I don't know.

40
00:02:20,758 --> 00:02:24,264
Anyway, you're free to go.

41
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:25,800
Somebody waiting out here
to pick you up.

42
00:02:25,801 --> 00:02:29,041
Says she's your sister.

43
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,290
<i>That happened, right?</i>

44
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:41,298
We flew…

45
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:43,336
here to Antarctica?

46
00:02:46,811 --> 00:02:48,513
I don't want to lose it-

47
00:02:48,514 --> 00:02:50,250
how it felt.

48
00:02:50,285 --> 00:02:53,156
I-it-
the sky, it, uh-

49
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:55,628
It's like you could feel it

50
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:59,202
inside the air.

51
00:02:59,236 --> 00:03:01,239
Part of it-
all of it, like-

52
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,610
Everything fit…

53
00:03:03,646 --> 00:03:05,882
all by itself.

54
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:18,241
Penny, can we-

55
00:03:18,275 --> 00:03:20,378
Birds.

56
00:03:20,413 --> 00:03:22,716
I never shit so much in my life.

57
00:03:22,717 --> 00:03:26,724
But at least I got
to eat bugs, so…that.

58
00:03:26,725 --> 00:03:31,434
Now snow.
God, I hate snow.

59
00:03:31,468 --> 00:03:33,939
Hey, you were told
to report here, right?

60
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,476
By that TA or whatever?

61
00:03:35,477 --> 00:03:37,212
Uh, yeah.

62
00:03:37,246 --> 00:03:41,588
I saw him herd another six
or seven kids into the library.

63
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:44,627
So what is this then?

64
00:03:44,662 --> 00:03:46,732
We're here to study
with Mayakovsky.

65
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:51,053
- Who I hear is crazy.
- You heard wrong.

66
00:03:54,783 --> 00:03:57,888
Sit.

67
00:03:57,922 --> 00:03:59,257
I do not ask

68
00:03:59,258 --> 00:04:02,330
and I do not order twice.

69
00:04:14,456 --> 00:04:16,425
I hate you.

70
00:04:18,531 --> 00:04:21,369
I hate all of you.

71
00:04:21,403 --> 00:04:23,641
And you know why?

72
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:28,384
It's the Hammer Charm
of Legrand.

73
00:04:28,385 --> 00:04:29,653
We know this.

74
00:04:29,654 --> 00:04:31,557
I hate all of you

75
00:04:31,591 --> 00:04:35,965
because you don't know anything.

76
00:04:35,999 --> 00:04:38,504
You learn magic like

77
00:04:38,538 --> 00:04:41,777
parrot learns Shakespeare:
tricks for birdseeds.

78
00:04:41,778 --> 00:04:44,349
You are all clever pets.

79
00:04:44,383 --> 00:04:46,553
You.

80
00:04:46,588 --> 00:04:48,692
Sultry-But-Damaged.

81
00:04:48,726 --> 00:04:52,198
What is the Hammer Charm
of Legrand?

82
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,770
It's, um-
it's the-

83
00:04:54,805 --> 00:04:57,409
One day your looks
will be gone like that

84
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,582
and unless there's
a brain behind

85
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:04,790
those batting eyelashes

86
00:05:04,825 --> 00:05:07,062
you will be selling oranges

87
00:05:07,063 --> 00:05:09,400
at an off-ramp.

88
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,471
It's a spell that makes
nails go into boards

89
00:05:11,472 --> 00:05:13,608
perfectly straight.

90
00:05:17,952 --> 00:05:20,022
You think you know
how to do this,

91
00:05:20,023 --> 00:05:22,693
I assure you, you do not.

92
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:27,323
<i>Ein saat schlug tief-</i>

93
00:05:34,887 --> 00:05:38,092
Your voices are your enemies.

94
00:05:38,126 --> 00:05:40,664
A great Magician-

95
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:43,169
and as you gaze
into your mirrors

96
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,006
in the coming years,

97
00:05:45,007 --> 00:05:47,678
you may recall that I

98
00:05:47,713 --> 00:05:51,219
was the last great Magician
you ever saw,

99
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:56,563
a great Magician is magic

100
00:05:56,597 --> 00:05:58,333
in his bones,

101
00:05:58,368 --> 00:06:00,004
blood, heart,

102
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:02,008
and dick.

103
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:05,014
Or lady parts.
Whatever.

104
00:06:06,852 --> 00:06:09,823
Begin.

105
00:06:29,201 --> 00:06:35,201
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny

106
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:48,936
Does this say "Ibiza"?

107
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,272
Yes,

108
00:06:50,307 --> 00:06:53,813
but this…

109
00:06:53,848 --> 00:06:56,017
screams "Ibiza."

110
00:06:58,991 --> 00:07:00,961
Hey, so Ibiza…

111
00:07:00,995 --> 00:07:02,163
Is a place-

112
00:07:02,164 --> 00:07:03,800
That we're going to.

113
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:06,304
<i>I'm hearing Encanto Octulo
this year</i>

114
00:07:06,305 --> 00:07:09,478
is gonna be, like,
off the chain,

115
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:11,649
but you have to be invited

116
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,153
by people who've been…

117
00:07:13,154 --> 00:07:15,557
And you guys have both been.

118
00:07:15,558 --> 00:07:18,163
- Twice.
- Right.

119
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,908
Margo, you look so beautiful.

120
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:25,611
Uh, I-I can't even-

121
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,916
I got this.

122
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,452
Tell me your name again.

123
00:07:29,453 --> 00:07:31,757
- Todd.
- Todd.

124
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,360
Here's the thing.

125
00:07:33,361 --> 00:07:37,535
<i>Encanto Oculto
is a solid week of sun,</i>

126
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,539
drugs, and magical art.

127
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,412
Time stops, reality bends,

128
00:07:42,446 --> 00:07:44,316
and you fuck five times a day.

129
00:07:44,317 --> 00:07:45,585
On a bad day.

130
00:07:45,586 --> 00:07:47,388
It sounds awesome.

131
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:49,125
It is, Todd.

132
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,700
It is awesome, but honestly,

133
00:07:52,734 --> 00:07:54,637
you'd end up in a corner alone.

134
00:07:54,638 --> 00:07:58,445
Bitter.
Bumming everyone out.

135
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,317
Like last year at the bacchanal.

136
00:08:01,318 --> 00:08:04,190
Poor-
Wait, what was his name?

137
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:06,294
- Um-
- Hmm.

138
00:08:06,328 --> 00:08:08,331
- Todd.
- Todd.

139
00:08:08,366 --> 00:08:10,402
How weird is that?

140
00:08:10,436 --> 00:08:14,443
Todd, you don't want to
end up like the other Todd.

141
00:08:14,444 --> 00:08:17,349
What happened to him?

142
00:08:17,384 --> 00:08:19,821
He just wasn't
meant to be there.

143
00:08:19,822 --> 00:08:23,729
He moped and whined
and brought everything down.

144
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,200
Okay, we were a little wrecked,

145
00:08:26,201 --> 00:08:29,875
and for fun, someone-

146
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:32,580
- someone not us…
- No, not us.

147
00:08:32,581 --> 00:08:37,141
- Turned Todd into a pig.
- And we ate him.

148
00:08:38,327 --> 00:08:43,067
Wait, are you guys
messing with me right now?

149
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:46,543
Okay.

150
00:08:46,577 --> 00:08:49,014
Well, I'm just gonna…

151
00:08:49,048 --> 00:08:52,153
I'm gonna…

152
00:08:55,195 --> 00:08:59,702
Oh, my God.

153
00:08:59,737 --> 00:09:01,373
Okay, focus.

154
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:04,746
<i>Last thing: the regalo.</i>

155
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,351
The re-what-now?

156
00:09:07,386 --> 00:09:08,587
The gift to the elders

157
00:09:08,588 --> 00:09:10,090
footing the bill
for the debauchery.

158
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,495
Right.
What did we get them last year?

159
00:09:12,496 --> 00:09:14,933
An actual, working bag of dicks.

160
00:09:14,934 --> 00:09:17,104
Right.
It was lame.

161
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,410
You got anything?

162
00:09:19,444 --> 00:09:20,745
You?

163
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,616
I wrote something down.

164
00:09:22,617 --> 00:09:25,188
These TA's were whispering,

165
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:28,962
so I figured it had to be good.

166
00:09:28,997 --> 00:09:31,634
They were talking about-yes.

167
00:09:31,635 --> 00:09:33,772
"How to make magical gin."

168
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:36,076
Mmm, gin and tonic.

169
00:09:36,111 --> 00:09:37,780
Strong, classic.

170
00:09:37,815 --> 00:09:40,118
No one kicks that out
of a party.

171
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:41,187
Me likey.

172
00:09:41,221 --> 00:09:43,291
Good, but this you hatey.

173
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:44,961
I only got part of the spell.

174
00:09:44,962 --> 00:09:49,582
We have to dig out the rest
in the library.

175
00:11:39,262 --> 00:11:43,502
Why don't you two just fuck?

176
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:49,414
No?

177
00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:51,953
Then try this:

178
00:11:51,987 --> 00:11:53,890
work!

179
00:12:03,748 --> 00:12:05,346
I'm fine, okay

180
00:12:05,473 --> 00:12:08,077
I'm just-

181
00:12:08,111 --> 00:12:10,849
I got hooked up with
some sketchy people,

182
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:13,622
but I'm fine.
Okay?

183
00:12:17,497 --> 00:12:20,736
I'll get to this tomorrow.

184
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:24,568
Blood's not going to
come out of that sweater.

185
00:12:24,569 --> 00:12:25,570
You should just throw it out.

186
00:12:25,571 --> 00:12:27,341
Okay, thanks…

187
00:12:30,782 --> 00:12:34,221
For getting me home.

188
00:12:34,256 --> 00:12:35,792
I'll call you.

189
00:12:35,793 --> 00:12:37,494
- I'm staying.
- What?

190
00:12:37,495 --> 00:12:40,000
To make sure you're okay.

191
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:42,104
You really don't
have to do that, I'm-

192
00:12:42,105 --> 00:12:44,910
The blankets still here?

193
00:12:44,944 --> 00:12:46,880
Yup.

194
00:12:58,672 --> 00:13:01,510
What is this?

195
00:13:01,544 --> 00:13:02,947
It's Arabic.

196
00:13:02,981 --> 00:13:04,817
I flunked Arabic.

197
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:07,088
I got an A.

198
00:13:07,122 --> 00:13:09,961
Well, partly because I paid
for the exam answers

199
00:13:09,962 --> 00:13:13,100
in nipple clamps.

200
00:13:13,134 --> 00:13:15,973
Bag Of Dicks is sounding
awful good.

201
00:13:15,974 --> 00:13:18,111
Ooh, copy that.

202
00:13:20,683 --> 00:13:23,188
Whoa.

203
00:13:23,222 --> 00:13:25,559
She means "Hi."

204
00:13:25,593 --> 00:13:27,363
Are you guys trying
to translate Arabic

205
00:13:27,364 --> 00:13:28,699
because I aced it here?

206
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,235
I mean, it was a couple
years ago, but-

207
00:13:30,236 --> 00:13:31,805
Yeah, mm-hmm.

208
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,910
Cry for help.

209
00:13:33,944 --> 00:13:35,480
Answered.

210
00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:42,827
- Mike.
- Eliot.

211
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,239
Margo.

212
00:14:15,028 --> 00:14:16,830
Yes, yes.

213
00:14:16,865 --> 00:14:21,106
By all means,
congratulate yourselves.

214
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:25,949
You are both such winners.

215
00:14:58,783 --> 00:15:02,523
Possibly your first
intelligent communiqué.

216
00:15:02,524 --> 00:15:06,865
You should have been
rendered mute long ago.

217
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:09,070
Now you're probably wondering,

218
00:15:09,071 --> 00:15:11,308
"What next?"

219
00:15:14,115 --> 00:15:18,105
Bujold's Nail Extraction,
that's what.

220
00:15:38,364 --> 00:15:41,002
- You need help.
- "Help."

221
00:15:41,003 --> 00:15:42,806
You can't keep going like this.

222
00:15:42,807 --> 00:15:44,676
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

223
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:46,112
Jules.

224
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:47,816
Please.

225
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:48,851
This is just like Daddy.

226
00:15:48,852 --> 00:15:50,772
Daddy was a drunk.

227
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:52,358
He was crazy.
I'm not-

228
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:54,629
James told us he's worried.

229
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,133
James?

230
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:58,170
Well, let me bring you
up to speed.

231
00:15:58,171 --> 00:16:01,543
James doesn't remember me…
at all.

232
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,480
He called last month.

233
00:16:03,481 --> 00:16:06,019
Said the reason you dropped out
was your recovery.

234
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,359
Well, so much
for "anonymous," right?

235
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,401
He cares, Julia.
So do I.

236
00:16:13,436 --> 00:16:15,071
It's why I left eight messages.

237
00:16:15,072 --> 00:16:19,002
I mean if I had known
that you were-

238
00:16:19,781 --> 00:16:22,119
Mom knows you got arrested.

239
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,622
She has to keep this
out of the papers.

240
00:16:23,623 --> 00:16:25,192
She just got elected
to the board of the Met

241
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:27,796
and is trying to close
on a new co-op.

242
00:16:27,797 --> 00:16:29,935
Of course she is.

243
00:16:29,969 --> 00:16:31,404
She said you're gonna
get help, or-

244
00:16:31,405 --> 00:16:32,908
Or what?

245
00:16:32,942 --> 00:16:35,980
You tell her that I'm not Daddy.
I'm not crazy.

246
00:16:35,981 --> 00:16:41,425
She's not sticking me someplace
to rot where she stuck him.

247
00:16:41,426 --> 00:16:45,065
She's not gonna let go of this.

248
00:16:45,099 --> 00:16:48,072
Well,
I'm sorry, what can she do?

249
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,808
You know, I'm an adult.

250
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:52,113
Who disappeared,

251
00:16:52,148 --> 00:16:55,019
confessed to being on drugs,
got arrested.

252
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,588
You think she doesn't
go to the opera

253
00:16:56,589 --> 00:16:58,592
with ten judges who would
happily commit you?

254
00:16:58,593 --> 00:17:02,267
She's Mom.

255
00:17:02,301 --> 00:17:04,071
Fucking bitch.

256
00:17:04,105 --> 00:17:07,315
Right down to her lizard pumps.

257
00:17:08,648 --> 00:17:10,584
But I'm not.

258
00:17:13,056 --> 00:17:15,594
I love you

259
00:17:15,628 --> 00:17:17,966
and I can keep her away

260
00:17:17,967 --> 00:17:19,702
and get you help.

261
00:17:19,703 --> 00:17:23,343
Just please let me.

262
00:17:23,378 --> 00:17:25,614
I called a place.

263
00:17:25,649 --> 00:17:28,439
They can take you tomorrow.

264
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:31,861
A "place"?

265
00:17:33,573 --> 00:17:38,509
You remain because you're best.

266
00:17:39,045 --> 00:17:41,191
***

267
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,391
You may now speak.

268
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,738
You remain silent?

269
00:17:50,772 --> 00:17:53,476
Perhaps you're teachable
after all.

270
00:17:53,477 --> 00:17:54,913
Good.

271
00:17:54,947 --> 00:17:58,086
As that which you
will now learn,

272
00:17:58,087 --> 00:18:02,762
few know
and even fewer understand.

273
00:18:03,932 --> 00:18:06,937
Mind control.

274
00:18:06,971 --> 00:18:09,342
And these…

275
00:18:11,481 --> 00:18:13,941
Are your first subjects.

276
00:18:15,188 --> 00:18:17,392
Uh…

277
00:18:17,426 --> 00:18:19,362
isn't that kind of unethical?

278
00:18:19,363 --> 00:18:22,034
I mean, even if they're bugs,
they're alive.

279
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:23,270
They have free will.

280
00:18:23,271 --> 00:18:25,007
We've been taught not to

281
00:18:25,008 --> 00:18:28,681
try to control living things.

282
00:18:28,716 --> 00:18:30,685
How was your lunch today?

283
00:18:30,686 --> 00:18:32,823
Excellent boeuf bourguignon, no?

284
00:18:32,824 --> 00:18:34,660
And how much free will

285
00:18:34,661 --> 00:18:37,599
was exerted by the cow?

286
00:18:39,137 --> 00:18:43,244
Mind control
is in everything, everywhere.

287
00:18:43,245 --> 00:18:45,549
We make only one choice:

288
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:48,054
are you the controller

289
00:18:48,088 --> 00:18:49,858
or controlled?

290
00:18:58,543 --> 00:19:03,219
You do not like the moth I see.

291
00:19:03,253 --> 00:19:04,521
Good.

292
00:19:04,555 --> 00:19:07,494
That which you hate-

293
00:19:07,528 --> 00:19:09,364
or fear,

294
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:14,007
will motivate you to enslave it.

295
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,579
Ah.

296
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,483
My favorite.

297
00:19:33,514 --> 00:19:35,617
You're psychic?

298
00:19:38,024 --> 00:19:41,664
- You're also Traveler?
- Yeah.

299
00:19:41,698 --> 00:19:45,438
What idiot marked you there?
Don't tell me.

300
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:48,311
- A well-meaning educator.
- It's saving my life.

301
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,546
It's chaining you to a rock.

302
00:19:49,547 --> 00:19:51,784
You are free.

303
00:19:51,818 --> 00:19:55,158
More free than almost anyone
in this universe

304
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:57,079
or any other.
Ah.

305
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:02,539
Where you think
you're sticking that?

306
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,713
They told you not to travel, eh?

307
00:20:05,714 --> 00:20:08,017
Too unpredictable,
too hard to control-

308
00:20:08,018 --> 00:20:10,990
Yeah, because it is.
I got zero control.

309
00:20:10,991 --> 00:20:12,860
I don't-I don't even have
a decent sense of direction.

310
00:20:12,861 --> 00:20:15,232
Is like telling eagle

311
00:20:15,266 --> 00:20:19,207
to fear heights.

312
00:20:19,241 --> 00:20:22,346
I teach you to soar.

313
00:20:24,018 --> 00:20:25,686
Yes?

314
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:41,252
So-so, wait.

315
00:20:41,286 --> 00:20:44,391
So, um-
so, so you know Rick?

316
00:20:44,392 --> 00:20:47,662
Oh, my God, Rick is-
is great.

317
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:53,665
This magic gin better make us
see unicorns that fart rainbows.

318
00:20:53,678 --> 00:20:57,618
Guys, we have a lot
of work to do here.

319
00:20:57,619 --> 00:21:00,825
Just bang.

320
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,227
Now!

321
00:21:19,363 --> 00:21:21,066
Okay, that was weird.

322
00:21:21,067 --> 00:21:22,535
Describe.

323
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:25,341
Yeah, I was in
my hometown in-in Florida.

324
00:21:25,342 --> 00:21:28,681
Weird. Dull.
Again.

325
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,902
Yes?

326
00:21:38,937 --> 00:21:40,138
Uh, desert.

327
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,707
- Earth?
- Yeah.

328
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,779
Maybe Afghanistan.
There were guys with guns.

329
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,217
Um, I think I saw a drone.

330
00:21:46,218 --> 00:21:49,023
Again.

331
00:21:54,368 --> 00:21:55,770
Fucking volcano!

332
00:21:55,771 --> 00:21:57,005
Jesus.

333
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,190
Which you survived.
Gold star.

334
00:22:04,488 --> 00:22:07,560
Well, you seem
to be the only ones

335
00:22:07,561 --> 00:22:09,932
who can't complete the task.

336
00:22:09,933 --> 00:22:12,638
In one case, surprising.

337
00:22:12,672 --> 00:22:13,932
The other…

338
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,829
We try something new.

339
00:22:24,863 --> 00:22:28,803
The rings are wired to zap.

340
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:33,813
Bug flies into ring.

341
00:22:33,849 --> 00:22:35,617
Ah, Jesus.

342
00:22:35,652 --> 00:22:37,488
Your fate is now tied

343
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:40,460
to the lowest form
of sentient life.

344
00:22:40,461 --> 00:22:43,467
I deem that…

345
00:22:43,502 --> 00:22:45,638
appropriate.

346
00:22:47,743 --> 00:22:50,113
Let's just get one.

347
00:22:50,148 --> 00:22:51,850
Okay.

348
00:22:51,885 --> 00:22:53,120
Upper left.

349
00:22:53,155 --> 00:22:56,026
Okay.

350
00:23:03,843 --> 00:23:04,978
Okay.

351
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:11,558
- It's working.
- Yeah.

352
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:13,328
Okay.

353
00:23:17,204 --> 00:23:18,939
Yes! Yes!

354
00:23:18,973 --> 00:23:21,144
Whoa, I am so-
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

355
00:23:21,145 --> 00:23:22,546
- It's okay.
- Sorry.

356
00:23:22,547 --> 00:23:24,350
It's okay.

357
00:23:24,385 --> 00:23:26,454
Whoa-ow.

358
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:29,052
Quentin!

359
00:23:36,809 --> 00:23:39,113
I-I-
I don't, um-

360
00:23:39,147 --> 00:23:41,034
I'm-I'm-
I'm sorry, really sorry-

361
00:23:41,035 --> 00:23:44,141
Jesus.

362
00:23:44,175 --> 00:23:45,675
Is that vodka?

363
00:23:45,678 --> 00:23:47,347
You want me to flunk him

364
00:23:47,348 --> 00:23:50,888
so you can pass this test
with flying colors alone?

365
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:52,791
No, sir.

366
00:23:54,897 --> 00:23:58,202
I tried.

367
00:24:00,074 --> 00:24:02,512
Again.

368
00:24:02,546 --> 00:24:05,250
No.

369
00:24:06,955 --> 00:24:08,156
Again.

370
00:24:11,364 --> 00:24:13,334
Ha, yes! Yeah!

371
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:16,273
Oh, my God.

372
00:24:20,048 --> 00:24:21,784
Where's the joy?

373
00:24:21,785 --> 00:24:23,554
The fun?

374
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:27,896
Why are you both determined

559
00:37:33,147 --> 00:37:34,716
Pack a swimsuit.

560
00:37:34,717 --> 00:37:36,320
Seriously?

561
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:37,989
Ground rules:

562
00:37:38,024 --> 00:37:39,793
you need to fit in,

563
00:37:39,794 --> 00:37:41,354
so don't talk.

564
00:37:41,364 --> 00:37:43,668
Um…

565
00:37:43,702 --> 00:37:45,572
See that she hydrates,

566
00:37:45,573 --> 00:37:47,576
wears sunblock, and waxes.

567
00:37:47,577 --> 00:37:51,117
Mama's down south
can get jungly.

568
00:37:52,486 --> 00:37:56,176
And you're in charge
of the genie.

569
00:39:14,353 --> 00:39:17,125
Hey.

570
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:20,030
Come back to bed.

571
00:39:20,065 --> 00:39:22,068
Be right there…

572
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:34,527
- Hey, where's Kady?
- Who gives a shit?

573
00:39:34,528 --> 00:39:37,199
Alice, Quentin.

574
00:39:37,233 --> 00:39:40,573
I got you both to drop
your fears and inhibitions.

575
00:39:40,574 --> 00:39:42,376
For that you should be
eternally grateful,

576
00:39:42,377 --> 00:39:46,184
but I give you more.

577
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:49,591
I give you your life's purpose.

578
00:39:49,625 --> 00:39:52,197
Go and live

579
00:39:52,231 --> 00:39:56,705
to prove me wrong.

580
00:39:56,739 --> 00:39:58,810
Love each other,

581
00:39:58,845 --> 00:40:00,881
be honest and kind,

582
00:40:00,915 --> 00:40:04,087
faithful and happy,

583
00:40:04,121 --> 00:40:06,626
and then,

584
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:09,197
come back here in 50 years

585
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:11,636
with your perfect family

586
00:40:11,637 --> 00:40:15,444
and gloat over my frozen corpse.

587
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:19,952
You're welcome.

588
00:40:19,987 --> 00:40:21,322
Quentin…

589
00:40:21,357 --> 00:40:23,426
why?

590
00:40:23,461 --> 00:40:25,330
Why the fox?

591
00:40:25,365 --> 00:40:29,105
Why not mollusk or firefly?
Why?

592
00:40:29,139 --> 00:40:31,342
The fox knows

593
00:40:31,377 --> 00:40:34,716
and I knew…

594
00:40:34,751 --> 00:40:37,321
everything I needed
to survive was me

595
00:40:37,322 --> 00:40:38,991
and it's not just to survive,

596
00:40:38,992 --> 00:40:42,465
but to be happy.

597
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,736
I was…

598
00:40:44,771 --> 00:40:46,340
happy.

599
00:40:46,374 --> 00:40:49,212
The fox is in you now-

600
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:52,920
both of you.

601
00:40:52,955 --> 00:40:55,058
Feed it.

602
00:40:59,902 --> 00:41:03,112
You really are a great teacher.

603
00:41:04,445 --> 00:41:06,414
I know.

1
00:00:00,211 --> 00:00:01,625
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"…</i>

2
00:00:01,745 --> 00:00:04,094
Let's just net this
all in the bud.

3
00:00:04,214 --> 00:00:05,415
You were the paramedic.

4
00:00:05,516 --> 00:00:07,250
Call me Eliza.
I was there that day

5
00:00:07,351 --> 00:00:09,419
to make sure that you got here.

6
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,789
- We flew here to Antarctica?
- So what is this then?

7
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,557
We're here to study
with Mayakovsky.

8
00:00:14,658 --> 00:00:18,161
Remove your clothes.
Do it!

9
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:22,799
A few minutes,
we're flying again.

10
00:00:25,035 --> 00:00:28,304
They know everything
at Brakebills, what you've done.

11
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:29,839
You cannot go back.

12
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,908
- Hey, where's Kady?
- Who gives a shit?

13
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,276
Run.

14
00:00:37,147 --> 00:00:38,815
You can't keep going like this.

15
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:41,117
I called a place.
They can take you tomorrow.

16
00:00:41,218 --> 00:00:42,852
A "place"?

17
00:00:42,953 --> 00:00:44,854
- Mike.
- Eliot.

18
00:00:44,955 --> 00:00:46,756
What's so special about him?

19
00:01:22,793 --> 00:01:24,660
It's a little something
I invented.

20
00:01:24,762 --> 00:01:26,229
Oh.

21
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,297
I'd take a beer
if you've got one.

22
00:01:28,398 --> 00:01:30,566
A beer?

23
00:01:30,667 --> 00:01:33,102
You are lucky you're pretty.

24
00:01:33,203 --> 00:01:34,937
Eliot.

25
00:01:35,038 --> 00:01:37,273
You're back.

26
00:01:37,374 --> 00:01:39,242
Hooray!

27
00:01:39,343 --> 00:01:40,810
Oh, thank God.

28
00:01:40,911 --> 00:01:42,671
How do you always have drinks
waiting for us?

29
00:01:42,713 --> 00:01:48,551
Oh, just a good host, I guess.

30
00:01:48,652 --> 00:01:51,387
Guys, this is my friend Mike.

31
00:01:51,488 --> 00:01:53,890
He graduated a few years ago
and lives in New York,

32
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:55,825
and Margo tried to kill him
with a Djinn,

33
00:01:55,926 --> 00:01:57,126
but we fixed it.

34
00:01:57,227 --> 00:01:58,928
This is Alice, that's Quentin.

35
00:01:59,029 --> 00:02:00,663
- They are nerds.
- I could kind of tell.

36
00:02:00,764 --> 00:02:03,466
How was Brakebills South?
Did anyone freeze to death?

37
00:02:03,567 --> 00:02:05,835
Oh, I mean, it was--

38
00:02:05,936 --> 00:02:08,771
it was eventful.
I--

39
00:02:08,872 --> 00:02:12,141
Why is your face
making that face?

40
00:02:12,242 --> 00:02:15,311
Oh, my God.

41
00:02:15,412 --> 00:02:17,513
- They totally had sex.
- Yeah.

42
00:02:17,614 --> 00:02:18,815
- No, nothing happened.
- I mean, it just happened.

43
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:20,349
Let me guess.

44
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,090
You got drunk
on Mayakovsky's lichen vodka

45
00:02:22,152 --> 00:02:23,452
and you seduced him.

46
00:02:23,554 --> 00:02:25,221
Maybe I seduced her.

47
00:02:25,322 --> 00:02:27,390
Please. And sweetie,

48
00:02:27,491 --> 00:02:30,526
getting drunk and porking
a dungeon master

49
00:02:30,627 --> 00:02:31,727
is nothing to be a ashamed of.

50
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:32,995
Ah, porking?

51
00:02:33,096 --> 00:02:34,397
I was looking at the pork butt.

52
00:02:34,498 --> 00:02:36,532
I'm going to go take a nap

53
00:02:36,633 --> 00:02:38,768
and pretend that this entire
conversation never happened.

54
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:40,269
Okay.

55
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,804
Ah, ah, I--

56
00:02:45,475 --> 00:02:47,710
- Nice meeting you.
- Mm-hmm.

57
00:02:47,811 --> 00:02:49,512
Eyes on the pork butt, mister.

58
00:02:49,613 --> 00:02:50,613
- He's pretty.
- I know.

59
00:02:50,714 --> 00:02:51,914
But I called dibs on him.

60
00:02:56,553 --> 00:02:59,288
Hey, ignore Eliot.
He's--

61
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:03,025
You know, just being Eliot.

62
00:03:05,929 --> 00:03:07,430
Don't.

63
00:03:07,531 --> 00:03:11,067
I thought "nap" was code.

64
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:17,173
Can we just talk about this
seriously for a second?

65
00:03:17,274 --> 00:03:22,411
What we did was stress and
circumstances, and pheromones.

66
00:03:22,512 --> 00:03:24,247
The first time,
but not the next four.

67
00:03:24,348 --> 00:03:27,683
- You were…counting?
- Of course I was counting.

68
00:03:27,784 --> 00:03:29,252
Maybe Eliot's right.

69
00:03:29,353 --> 00:03:31,187
We might as well have been
drunk or high, or--

70
00:03:31,288 --> 00:03:32,989
I'm not under the influence
right now.

71
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,858
Yes, we are, Q.

72
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:39,195
I can still smell you,
but like, fox you,

73
00:03:39,296 --> 00:03:41,163
and I'm pretty sure you can
still smell me.

74
00:03:41,265 --> 00:03:43,165
That could have
a lot to do with the fact

75
00:03:43,267 --> 00:03:44,095
that we haven't bathed in weeks.

76
00:03:44,215 --> 00:03:45,843
Are you in love with me?

77
00:03:48,105 --> 00:03:49,427
I, uh--I don't know.

78
00:03:49,547 --> 00:03:51,207
Even if you fell down
on your knees

79
00:03:51,308 --> 00:03:53,576
and proclaimed your, you know.

80
00:03:53,677 --> 00:03:56,479
I know it wasn't really you.

81
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:02,051
I think that we need to…
spend some time apart,

82
00:04:02,152 --> 00:04:04,053
so we can know what's real
and what's fox.

83
00:04:12,462 --> 00:04:14,063
<i>When they were lost,</i>

84
00:04:14,164 --> 00:04:16,465
ancient sailors used the stars
to find their way,

85
00:04:16,566 --> 00:04:18,234
but, for you,
they're an obstacle

86
00:04:18,335 --> 00:04:20,369
because they change
Circumstances

87
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,305
so they can really bone
your casting.

88
00:04:22,406 --> 00:04:25,374
When you're factoring
the position of the Pleiades--

89
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:26,909
You want to keep in mind--

90
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,278
Whoa!

91
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:31,647
Whoa.

92
00:04:31,748 --> 00:04:34,283
Sorry, I just,
uh, I'll leave you--

93
00:04:34,384 --> 00:04:37,653
in your little sewing circle.

94
00:04:37,754 --> 00:04:39,322
There's a syllabus, Penny,

95
00:04:39,423 --> 00:04:40,823
and you're supposed
to be studying--

96
00:04:40,924 --> 00:04:42,391
Haven't you heard--
haven't you--

97
00:04:42,492 --> 00:04:43,893
You're supposed to be studying
Astral Projection.

98
00:04:43,994 --> 00:04:44,994
Now, here is what I know.

99
00:04:45,062 --> 00:04:46,595
I fell like less of a pussy

100
00:04:46,697 --> 00:04:48,698
if I don't cower in fear
of my own ability.

101
00:04:48,799 --> 00:04:50,499
I mean, if I supposed to ever
be able to travel,

102
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,869
like really Travel
between worlds, I need--

103
00:04:53,971 --> 00:04:55,251
I need to be able to master this

104
00:04:55,305 --> 00:04:57,540
Earth-bound small potato
shit first.

105
00:04:57,641 --> 00:04:59,709
Is something else going on?

106
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:03,980
I know that you were close
with Kady.

107
00:05:04,081 --> 00:05:05,681
Not as close as you'd think.

108
00:05:10,754 --> 00:05:15,157
You know I-I have a great idea.

109
00:05:15,258 --> 00:05:17,193
I mean, you're so worried
about me,

110
00:05:17,294 --> 00:05:20,563
why don't you come Travel
with me?

111
00:05:20,664 --> 00:05:23,366
You teach me…

112
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:26,736
and I know there's a few things
I can teach you, too.

113
00:05:30,107 --> 00:05:34,777
I don't think
that would be appropriate.

114
00:05:34,878 --> 00:05:37,780
Oh, I totally agree.

115
00:05:37,881 --> 00:05:38,981
When do we leave?

116
00:05:41,318 --> 00:05:44,854
You're going to be late
for your next class.

117
00:05:51,161 --> 00:05:52,862
<i>Your first semester
with Brakebills</i>

118
00:05:52,963 --> 00:05:56,265
was dedicated to learning
the fundamentals of magic.

119
00:05:56,366 --> 00:05:58,734
We gave you the tools.

120
00:05:58,835 --> 00:06:01,804
Now, it is time for you
to use them.

121
00:06:01,905 --> 00:06:03,305
Look inside your bags.

122
00:06:03,407 --> 00:06:05,341
Starting today,

123
00:06:05,442 --> 00:06:07,309
your course load will double.

124
00:06:07,411 --> 00:06:10,413
Alchemy, astronomy, botany,

125
00:06:10,514 --> 00:06:11,680
just to name a few.

126
00:06:11,782 --> 00:06:14,784
Study groups are mandatory.

127
00:06:20,557 --> 00:06:22,525
Gretchen.

128
00:06:22,626 --> 00:06:26,362
Hey, uh, so I heard
that you sleep

129
00:06:26,463 --> 00:06:29,999
with Mister Spock body pillow.

130
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,367
No judgment. I just, um,

131
00:06:31,468 --> 00:06:33,869
I myself I have
a full collection

132
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:38,174
of Leonard Nimoy's spoken word
albums on vinyl.

133
00:06:38,275 --> 00:06:39,542
You interested?

134
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:43,746
Quentin, what are you--

135
00:06:43,847 --> 00:06:46,816
Gretchen, well,
basically begged me

136
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:50,820
to switch groups with her
and, uh, sorry.

137
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:52,354
I wore extra deodorant, though.

138
00:06:52,456 --> 00:06:56,559
Yeah.
It's strong.

139
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,861
So, are we the whole
study group?

140
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:06,068
Hell is real…

141
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:09,038
and it smells like
Axe Body Spray.

142

148
00:09:03,198 --> 00:09:05,232
Who's your pen pal?

149
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:07,701
Leave before I start screaming.

150
00:09:07,802 --> 00:09:11,372
Easy.
I just came here to talk.

151
00:09:11,473 --> 00:09:15,042
I'd say let's grab a drink
and hash shit out, but…

152
00:09:15,143 --> 00:09:16,744
I feel like
that's a no-no here.

153
00:09:16,845 --> 00:09:19,046
Why don't you talk about
what you did to Hannah.

154
00:09:19,147 --> 00:09:21,415
I was protecting myself
from a thief

155
00:09:21,516 --> 00:09:23,350
and I wish I hadn't been put
in that position.

156
00:09:26,955 --> 00:09:28,789
Is this an amends letter?

157
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,559
Yes. Some of us are capable
of making them.

158
00:09:32,661 --> 00:09:34,461
Okay.

159
00:09:35,597 --> 00:09:37,197
Try this.

160
00:09:39,034 --> 00:09:41,468
I'm sorry, Julia.

161
00:09:43,938 --> 00:09:46,507
I don't let in a lot of people.

162
00:09:46,608 --> 00:09:48,876
And the ones I do…

163
00:09:48,977 --> 00:09:53,614
it's got to be some kind of
kindred spirit thing happening.

164
00:09:53,715 --> 00:09:57,718
I actually like you.

165
00:09:57,819 --> 00:09:59,553
And this?

166
00:09:59,654 --> 00:10:03,157
This is not what I wanted.

167
00:10:03,258 --> 00:10:04,858
You mean what you wrote?

168
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,395
You're giving it up?

169
00:10:09,931 --> 00:10:13,634
Well, let's short circuit
this whole thing.

170
00:10:13,735 --> 00:10:15,169
You stay out of my ass

171
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:18,105
and there is no blood feud
necessary on my end.

172
00:10:20,775 --> 00:10:23,010
But come after me,

173
00:10:23,111 --> 00:10:27,114
and I will kill you and everyone
that you care about.

174
00:10:27,215 --> 00:10:30,584
Well, the ones that are left,
anyway.

175
00:10:34,856 --> 00:10:35,856
Such a bitch.

176
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,291
And you're weak.

177
00:10:37,392 --> 00:10:39,626
Why apologize to him?

178
00:10:39,728 --> 00:10:43,530
He's the one who should be
in here, not you.

179
00:10:45,066 --> 00:10:47,267
Take your time, Professor.

180
00:10:58,046 --> 00:10:59,646
You're good to go.

181
00:10:59,748 --> 00:11:01,749
Okay, Henry.

182
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:02,950
Go ahead and try something.

183
00:11:12,127 --> 00:11:15,195
Take it slow.

184
00:11:15,296 --> 00:11:17,331
Okay.

185
00:11:17,432 --> 00:11:19,466
It might take a few tries,
Henry.

186
00:11:19,567 --> 00:11:22,302
There are physical therapy
exercises --

187
00:11:22,403 --> 00:11:25,205
When I was four years old,

188
00:11:25,306 --> 00:11:29,543
with no instruction
or help from anyone,

189
00:11:29,644 --> 00:11:32,813
I taught myself magic.

190
00:11:32,914 --> 00:11:35,482
I will do so again.

191
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,219
This is a disaster!

192
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,023
- What's wrong?
- I have nothing to wear.

193
00:11:43,124 --> 00:11:46,560
You think that might be,
I don't know, hyperbole?

194
00:11:46,661 --> 00:11:50,330
I am not emotionally prepared
for Mike

195
00:11:50,431 --> 00:11:52,332
to see me repeat outfits.

196
00:11:52,433 --> 00:11:54,001
I think this might be
a Margo problem.

197
00:11:54,102 --> 00:11:56,270
Obviously, Quentin,
but she shacked up

198
00:11:56,371 --> 00:11:58,205
with some<i> artiste</i>
at Encanto Octulo,

199
00:11:58,306 --> 00:12:02,109
and, so, I'm stuck with you.

200
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:04,278
Honestly, all vests
look the same to me.

201
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:07,815
I made a horrible mistake
asking you to help.

202
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,149
Please, leave.

203
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,553
I was here first.

204
00:12:12,654 --> 00:12:15,889
I've never really seen you
care about something.

205
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,158
Things aren't usually
worth caring about.

206
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:22,062
With some limited,
but very important exceptions.

207
00:12:22,163 --> 00:12:24,298
Very limited.

208
00:12:26,534 --> 00:12:28,468
But seriously, leave.

209
00:12:31,873 --> 00:12:35,642
And for those who don't know
me way too well already,

210
00:12:35,743 --> 00:12:37,344
I'm Richard,
I'm the chaplain here

211
00:12:37,445 --> 00:12:41,348
and I will try to make my thing
today brief.

212
00:12:41,449 --> 00:12:43,851
No matter why you started using,

213
00:12:43,952 --> 00:12:47,120
if you try hard enough,
you can get clean.

214
00:12:47,222 --> 00:12:50,290
You can change everything
about your circumstances,

215
00:12:50,391 --> 00:12:54,194
but the one thing that won't
have changed is you.

216
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:59,733
Same head, same heart,
same mistakes.

217
00:12:59,834 --> 00:13:01,134
Now, we don't like to hear it,

218
00:13:01,236 --> 00:13:04,504
but we need something
or someone to lean on

219
00:13:04,606 --> 00:13:06,640
that is bigger than ourselves.

220
00:13:06,741 --> 00:13:08,175
Just say it.

221
00:13:08,276 --> 00:13:09,676
God.

222
00:13:09,777 --> 00:13:12,112
Well, that's one way
to putting it.

223
00:13:12,213 --> 00:13:14,214
You know, there is a word

224
00:13:14,315 --> 00:13:17,517
when you lean on something,
a crutch.

225
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,355
Replacing drugs or booze
or porn,

226
00:13:21,456 --> 00:13:22,856
or whatever with
a "Higher Power",

227
00:13:22,957 --> 00:13:24,758
it's just swapping one crutch
for another.

228
00:13:24,859 --> 00:13:27,527
That is a bummer way
of looking at things.

229
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:29,897
Why don't you just tell
these people the truth?

230
00:13:29,998 --> 00:13:33,567
Maybe we just need to accept
the world for what actually is.

231
00:13:33,668 --> 00:13:38,038
Oh, what about making
the world what we want it to be?

232
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:40,240
You know, with a little effort,
a little faith.

233
00:13:40,341 --> 00:13:44,144
Give a man hope and a nickel,
you got a nickel.

234
00:13:44,245 --> 00:13:47,180
- Who said that?
- Some dick.

235
00:13:47,282 --> 00:13:49,850
Wow!

236
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,852
So, what do you believe in?

237
00:13:51,953 --> 00:13:54,154
It doesn't have to be God
or whatever,

238
00:13:54,255 --> 00:13:56,890
but something bigger than you.

239
00:14:03,031 --> 00:14:04,598
I don't understand.

240
00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:06,433
The idea is you look
at the list of ingredients

241
00:14:06,534 --> 00:14:08,174
and try to figure out
what the spell does.

242
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:10,804
- Yeah.
- Maybe, we should move on,

243
00:14:10,905 --> 00:14:12,873
if we wait for the simpleton,
we'll be here all night.

244
00:14:12,974 --> 00:14:16,576
Okay, if you understand,
then explain it.

245
00:14:16,678 --> 00:14:18,845
It's a healing spell.
I've seen that

246
00:14:18,947 --> 00:14:20,347
welwitsch-whatever
in the infirmary.

247
00:14:20,448 --> 00:14:21,815
Actually, trick question.

248
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:24,418
It's a<i> welwitschia mirabilis,</i>

249
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:26,653
the leaves are used for both,
healing spells

250
00:14:26,754 --> 00:14:28,455
and for doing exotic curses.

251
00:14:29,757 --> 00:14:31,191
I thought it was a fern.

252
00:14:31,292 --> 00:14:32,652
Which is why I brought
flash cards.

253
00:14:32,694 --> 00:14:33,860
Of course you did.

254
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,597
Thank you, Alice.

255
00:14:37,699 --> 00:14:40,334
Could you not--
Could you-- for one minute,

256
00:14:40,435 --> 00:14:41,668
could you not give her
googly eye?

257
00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:42,836
Oh, God.

258
00:14:42,937 --> 00:14:44,438
I don't know what you're,

259
00:14:44,539 --> 00:14:47,007
uh, implying or, um, inferring.

260
00:14:47,108 --> 00:14:49,309
Brakebills South didn't have
a lot of things.

261
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:53,046
Livable weather, edible food,
cable TV,

262
00:14:53,147 --> 00:14:54,982
but you know what it did have?

263
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,551
Windows.

264
00:14:57,652 --> 00:14:59,987
So if you don't know
and saw your little--

265
00:15:00,088 --> 00:15:02,889
little extracurricular
activities,

266
00:15:02,991 --> 00:15:05,225
you'd be very mistaken foxes.

267
00:15:05,326 --> 00:15:06,827
I was above average for a fox.

268
00:15:06,928 --> 00:15:10,330
Okay, I've studied enough
for one day.

269
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:12,265
Thank you for that.

270
00:15:12,367 --> 00:15:15,635
It ain't my fault,
or my problem.

271
00:15:15,737 --> 00:15:17,170
For the record, you do see
that you're doing wrong, though?

272
00:15:17,271 --> 00:15:20,607
I don't need your help.

273
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,409
But if I hypothetically did--

274
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:25,512
Man, you act like a stalker

275
00:15:25,613 --> 00:15:29,483
and then go out of your way
to deny that you're interested.

276
00:15:29,584 --> 00:15:31,151
Either, grow a pair

277
00:15:31,252 --> 00:15:33,820
or she'll find someone
who already did.

278
00:15:34,922 --> 00:15:37,858
- Wow!
- Not done.

279
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,295
Only downside is,

280
00:15:42,397 --> 00:15:45,565
it burns off all the alcohol.

281
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:48,068
Looks amazing.

282
00:15:48,169 --> 00:15:50,570
Yeah, you don't have to kill
yourself for me.

283
00:15:50,671 --> 00:15:53,240
It was no trouble.

284
00:15:53,341 --> 00:15:58,111
I'm--I'm already deeply
impressed, you know?

285
00:15:58,212 --> 00:15:59,946
And, I mean, I feel like

286
00:16:00,048 --> 00:16:03,016
I should be doing stuff
like this for you, but…

287
00:16:03,117 --> 00:16:07,574
- I don't really know how.
- Don't be silly.

288
00:16:07,694 --> 00:16:11,425
I guess I'm just waiting
for the part in all of this

289
00:16:11,526 --> 00:16:13,527
where I start to bore you.

290
00:16:13,628 --> 00:16:14,415
You don't bore me.

291
00:16:14,535 --> 00:16:15,798
I don't think
that you could bore me.

292
00:16:15,918 --> 00:16:19,533
I don't know
about music and wine,

293
00:16:19,634 --> 00:16:23,070
and frankly any country
not named Texas.

294
00:16:23,171 --> 00:16:24,971
Texas is a state.

295
00:16:25,073 --> 00:16:26,758
Not when you're from Texas.

296
00:16:27,049 --> 00:16:29,175
Um…

297
00:16:30,378 --> 00:16:32,412
Come here.

298
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:43,156
Where do you think I come from?

299
00:16:43,257 --> 00:16:45,024
I don't know.

300
00:16:45,314 --> 00:16:46,415
Someplace with money?

301
00:16:46,516 --> 00:16:48,183
Well, um, we did have money.

302
00:16:48,284 --> 00:16:51,219
Until grandmama gambled it
all away

303
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,523
and now, all we have is titles.

304
00:16:54,624 --> 00:16:57,726
Sorry.
Um, that was a joke.

305
00:17:00,663 --> 00:17:03,665
I was…

306
00:17:03,766 --> 00:17:06,601
born in Indiana…

307
00:17:06,703 --> 00:17:08,904
on a farm.

308
00:17:09,005 --> 00:17:13,008
My parents are farmers.

309
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:15,343
Indiana? I--

310
00:17:15,445 --> 00:17:16,611
I thought you--

311
00:17:16,713 --> 00:17:19,915
Of course you did.

312
00:17:20,016 --> 00:17:25,120
Becoming me was the greatest
creative project of my life.

313
00:17:25,221 --> 00:17:26,988
So…

314
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:29,825
FYI, no one else here knows,
except for Margo,

315
00:17:29,926 --> 00:17:33,962
and that's only because she was
my secret partner in the Trials.

316
00:17:34,063 --> 00:17:36,732
Everyone else, I…

317
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,533
kind of let them go on thinking

318
00:17:38,634 --> 00:17:42,170
I grew up summering
with Kennedys, etcetera.

319
00:17:47,777 --> 00:17:49,211
Thank you.

320
00:17:49,312 --> 00:17:51,313
For what?

321
00:17:51,414 --> 00:17:53,281
Just you.

322
00:17:56,586 --> 00:17:58,954
Um, well…

323
00:18:01,758 --> 00:18:03,658
Here I am.

324
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,227
Yeah.

325
00:18:05,328 --> 00:18:08,864
Here you are.

326
00:18:08,965 --> 00:18:10,832
- Hi.
- Hey.

327
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,497
I checked the position
of Cephus three times,

328
00:18:42,598 --> 00:18:45,033
I did the whole invocation,

329
00:18:45,134 --> 00:18:49,838
this stupid plant should be
seven feet tall by now.

330
00:18:49,939 --> 00:18:51,807
What?

331
00:18:54,744 --> 00:18:56,812
What happened to you and Kady?

332
00:18:56,913 --> 00:18:59,147
You guys were inseparable.

333
00:18:59,248 --> 00:19:01,016
She gets through the Trials,

334
00:19:01,117 --> 00:19:04,019
passes all of Mayakovsky's test
and then she's just--

335
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,055
She didn't give me an itinerary.

336
00:19:07,156 --> 00:19:08,824
Man, I don't get it.

337
00:19:08,925 --> 00:19:12,194
You act like you're
this panty-whisperer,

338
00:19:12,295 --> 00:19:14,735
and your girl disappears and you
don't even know where she is.

339
00:19:14,797 --> 00:19:16,064
You see her,

340
00:19:16,165 --> 00:19:19,901
tell her she owes me 20 bucks.

341
00:19:20,002 --> 00:19:22,037
Can I help you?

342
00:19:22,138 --> 00:19:24,339
- What?
- Not you.

343
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,942
Ah, hey, Mike.

344
00:19:27,043 --> 00:19:29,444
Sorry. I got--I got
a little turned around.

345
00:19:29,545 --> 00:19:32,380
Um, could you tell me which way
the cottage is?

346
00:19:32,481 --> 00:19:33,915
Yeah. It's like--

347
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:38,854
Oh, shit.

348
00:19:55,938 --> 00:19:57,839
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

349
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,574
Whoa!

350
00:19:59,675 --> 00:20:03,041
Help!
Help! Somebody help!

351
00:20:04,574 --> 00:20:07,100
Get a transfusion ready, get
the Reidlinger Stones warmed up.

352
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,520
Can you mend the wound?

353
00:20:08,621 --> 00:20:09,721
It's deep,
but it's not impossible.

354
00:20:09,823 --> 00:20:11,023
The weapon.
We need the weapon.

355
00:20:11,057 --> 00:20:12,157
- Quentin.
- Mike. Mike has it.

356
00:20:12,258 --> 00:20:13,392
I need to see the knife to know.

357
00:20:13,493 --> 00:20:14,626
- Yes, yes, yes, I know.
- To know what?

358
00:20:14,727 --> 00:20:16,195
Find him. Now.

359
00:20:16,296 --> 00:20:20,732
Mike is, uh,
Eliot's boyfriend, I guess.

360
00:20:21,168 --> 00:20:23,736
He was trying to kill me
before Penny jumped in the way.

361
00:20:23,837 --> 00:20:25,905
Could have anything
to do with the Beast?

362
00:20:26,006 --> 00:20:27,039
Why would it?

363
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,340
Because it makes more sense

364
00:20:28,442 --> 00:20:30,242
than somebody new
try to kill me.

365
00:20:30,343 --> 00:20:32,578
Well, right now there are
far too many possibilities.

366
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:35,147
We will certainly ask
Mr. McCormick when we find him.

367
00:20:39,753 --> 00:20:42,388
Quentin.

368
00:20:42,489 --> 00:20:44,623
Is Penny okay?

369
00:20:44,724 --> 00:20:47,059
Uh, he's in surgery.
I don't know.

370
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,161
I just heard.
Everyone's really scared.

371
00:20:49,262 --> 00:20:51,022
I would've told you,
but Fogg wouldn't let us

372
00:20:51,064 --> 00:20:52,398
leave the building until…

373
00:20:52,499 --> 00:20:54,934
- Until they find Mike.
- They did find him.

374
00:20:55,035 --> 00:20:57,195
Professor Sunderland and March
found him trying to open

375
00:20:57,237 --> 00:20:59,104
a portal near
the Welters stadium.

376
00:21:02,008 --> 00:21:05,277
Where are they taking him?

377
00:21:05,378 --> 00:21:09,482
Have you ever been
in this room before?

378
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,650
It was designed at the turn
of the century

379
00:21:11,751 --> 00:21:16,455
for a sect of incredibly
delicate experiments.

380
00:21:16,556 --> 00:21:19,091
Mechanism within the walls,
prevent any spell casting,

381
00:21:19,192 --> 00:21:22,995
it is, in fact, a clean room.

382
00:21:23,096 --> 00:21:26,298
It was not intended
for this--this purpose,

383
00:21:26,399 --> 00:21:28,200
but it will do.

384
00:21:28,301 --> 00:21:30,636
Where is the weapon…

385
00:21:30,737 --> 00:21:32,638
- that you used?
- I don't know.

386
00:21:32,739 --> 00:21:36,041
Were you specifically
targeting Penny and Quentin?

387
00:21:36,142 --> 00:21:38,244
I was in Brooklyn.

388
00:21:38,345 --> 00:21:41,413
Then I was here.
I don't know!

389
00:21:41,515 --> 00:21:42,882
- Professor--
- Dean.

390
00:21:42,983 --> 00:21:45,818
Henry, look I--

391
00:21:48,054 --> 00:21:49,522
Okay.

392
00:21:49,623 --> 00:21:51,090
Okay look.

393
00:21:51,191 --> 00:21:53,359
Look, you know me, right?

394
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,561
I was your student
for three years,

395
00:21:55,662 --> 00:21:58,797
- you know that I couldn't.
- I know you did!

396
00:22:00,467 --> 00:22:03,135
No, you can't go in there.

397
00:22:03,236 --> 00:22:05,070
What did he say?

398
00:22:05,171 --> 00:22:07,139
Nothing useful.

399
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,760
You're just gonna leave him
in there?

400
00:22:08,808 --> 00:22:09,875
I'm not letting him go.

401
00:22:09,976 --> 00:22:11,477
No, I mean, that's inhumane.

402
00:22:11,578 --> 00:22:13,618
There is procedures
for dealing with magical crimes.

403
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,914
A circuit court system.

404
00:22:15,015 --> 00:22:16,549
They're sending
in a representative.

405
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,250
- What will they do with him?
- They have facilities.

406
00:22:18,351 --> 00:22:20,920
But the exact punishment,
it depends.

407
00:22:21,021 --> 00:22:23,055
- On what?
- On whether Penny lives.

408
00:22:23,156 --> 00:22:25,057
This reeks of mind control.

409
00:22:25,158 --> 00:22:26,958
Wait. There was something
wrong with his eyes.

410
00:22:26,993 --> 00:22:28,953
They weren't entirely human,
that--that could be--

411
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:31,163
I looked in every scenario
there is to think of.

412
00:22:31,264 --> 00:22:33,432
Spell gone wrong, doppelganger,

413
00:22:33,533 --> 00:22:35,601
and yes, gentlemen,
even mind control.

414
00:22:35,702 --> 00:22:38,671
But there was always the chance
that he did this,

415
00:22:38,772 --> 00:22:40,839
intentionally.

416
00:22:44,844 --> 00:22:45,844
Good morning.

417
00:22:45,946 --> 00:22:47,179
Pain killers.

418
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,714
Would be nice.

419
00:22:48,815 --> 00:22:50,482
Your surgery
was very successful.

420
00:22:50,584 --> 00:22:52,384
Your wounds are closed.

421
00:22:52,485 --> 00:22:54,486
Just one or two weeks of--

422
00:22:54,588 --> 00:22:57,323
Hey! You're not ready
to walk around yet.

423
00:22:57,424 --> 00:22:59,058
I was stabbed, woman,

424
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:01,393
I'm gonna find
the motherfucker who--

425
00:23:01,494 --> 00:23:03,329
Get Professor Lipson down here!

426
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:12,171
What?

427
00:23:13,961 --> 00:23:15,990
It's spreading too quickly
to be an infection.

428
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,277
The wound is cursed.

429
00:23:17,378 --> 00:23:18,878
Whatever it is,
is growing under the skin.

430
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,620
He's lucky it's not near
any vital organs.

431
00:23:20,681 --> 00:23:22,949
- The necrotizing tissue--
- Necrotizing?

432
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:25,018
Cell death within the tissue.

433
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:26,479
If it touches
something important--

434
00:23:26,554 --> 00:23:28,088
How do you fix it?

435
00:23:28,189 --> 00:23:30,824
Without seeing the knife I…

436
00:23:30,925 --> 00:23:32,492
I have no idea.

437
00:23:32,593 --> 00:23:34,260
I hate magic.

438
00:23:34,362 --> 00:23:35,595
I mean, why us?

439
00:23:35,696 --> 00:23:37,497
You, I get.

440
00:23:37,598 --> 00:23:39,332
I think about stabbing you
all the time.

441
00:23:41,869 --> 00:23:44,137
That was a 100% not a joke.

442
00:23:44,238 --> 00:23:46,439
You realized that knife
was coming at me

443
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:49,242
before you jump in the way
of it, right?

444
00:23:49,343 --> 00:23:52,612
I owe you, like,
a Wookie Life Debt.

445
00:23:52,713 --> 00:23:54,247
Get a knife.
I'll stab you right now.

446
00:24:02,723 --> 00:24:03,890
I keep thinking--

447
00:24:03,991 --> 00:24:06,960
- The Beast.
- It makes sense.

448
00:24:07,061 --> 00:24:09,562
And yet it doesn't.

449
00:24:09,664 --> 00:24:11,631
This Mike prick
isn't from Fillory.

450
00:24:11,732 --> 00:24:15,301
Yeah.

451
00:24:15,403 --> 00:24:16,703
Hey, do you want me to--

452
00:24:16,804 --> 00:24:18,405
Is there anyone you want me
to call?

453
00:24:18,506 --> 00:24:20,573
Parents, siblings,

454
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:22,976
parole officer?

455
00:24:23,077 --> 00:24:25,912
I'm good.

456
00:24:26,013 --> 00:24:27,380
No, Quentin.

457
00:24:27,481 --> 00:24:29,449
She cared, she'd be here.

458
00:24:35,723 --> 00:24:36,790
No visitors.

459
00:24:36,891 --> 00:24:37,957
Two minutes.

460
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,192
What could he possibly say

461
00:24:39,293 --> 00:24:40,360
that would make you feel
any better?

462
00:24:40,461 --> 00:24:42,529
I'm not here to feel better.

463
00:24:44,098 --> 00:24:46,599
Please.

464
00:24:46,701 --> 00:24:51,471
I was supposed to have
a date last night.

465
00:24:51,572 --> 00:24:54,074
I got all dressed up.

466
00:24:54,175 --> 00:24:57,544
I'm sorry.

467
00:24:57,645 --> 00:25:02,415
All this stuff they're saying
I did, I don't remember.

468
00:25:02,516 --> 00:25:05,018
You were blacked out.

469
00:25:11,792 --> 00:25:14,060
Were you blacked out
when we met?

470
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:29,695
No, I don't want to buy a bible.

471
00:25:34,715 --> 00:25:38,351
What safe house were you in?

472
00:25:38,452 --> 00:25:40,720
I recognized your ink.

473
00:25:40,821 --> 00:25:44,424
You see it more often than you'd
think in a place like this.

474
00:25:44,525 --> 00:25:45,425
You're a Hedge?

475
00:25:45,526 --> 00:25:46,893
No.

476
00:25:46,994 --> 00:25:48,862
Classically trained, myself.

477
00:25:48,963 --> 00:25:53,767
There's a special school,
called Brakebills.

478
00:25:53,868 --> 00:25:56,603
You heard of it?

479
00:25:56,704 --> 00:26:00,039
Yeah. Well…
I sort of checked myself

480
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,876
in here to get away
from magic, so…

481
00:26:02,977 --> 00:26:05,945
Look, you think magic
is some terrible vice,

482
00:26:06,046 --> 00:26:09,549
so bad that you need
rehab to get clean, it's not.

483
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:12,352
Magic isn't heroin, Julia.

484
00:26:12,453 --> 00:26:13,653
It's a gift.

485
00:26:13,754 --> 00:26:16,055
Oh, God, please.
Don't say from God.

486
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,724
I'm not the guy outside of YMCA

487
00:26:17,825 --> 00:26:18,958
yelling at people to repent.

488
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:21,060
Then what are you, Richard?

489
00:26:22,997 --> 00:26:26,666
Okay, what we call magic is,

490
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:28,735
a set of tools.

491
00:26:28,836 --> 00:26:30,670
Leftover from Creation.

492
00:26:30,771 --> 00:26:32,305
Think about it.

493
00:26:32,406 --> 00:26:34,574
The power to bend reality

494
00:26:34,675 --> 00:26:36,409
to make and unmake.

495
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:39,712
Won't God be pissed we touched
His tools without asking?

496
00:26:42,016 --> 00:26:46,186
God--
gods, really,

497
00:26:46,287 --> 00:26:48,788
they don't do things
by accident.

498
00:26:48,889 --> 00:26:51,391
The tools were left for us
to find.

499
00:26:51,492 --> 00:26:53,026
Right.

500
00:26:53,127 --> 00:26:56,362
But…

501
00:26:56,463 --> 00:26:58,565
what I'm saying,

502
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:00,300
you don't have to take
my word for it.

503
00:27:04,004 --> 00:27:06,172
See it for yourself.

504
00:27:15,683 --> 00:27:17,617
<i>Please!</i>

505
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,589
Penny?

506
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:24,958
It's just a headache.

507
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:27,093
I brought you your homework.

508
00:27:27,194 --> 00:27:29,896
- Why?
- Fair point.

509
00:27:29,997 --> 00:27:32,632
But if you were me, I'd be glad
to talk to somebody else

510
00:27:32,733 --> 00:27:34,767
who wasn't a Healing Student.

511
00:27:34,869 --> 00:27:36,836
And since Kady's not here…

512
00:27:38,472 --> 00:27:40,473
Oh, this is pity.

513
00:27:40,574 --> 00:27:43,109
No.

514
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,477
Well, kind of.

515
00:27:44,578 --> 00:27:46,018
I mean, she had shit to do
elsewhere.

516
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,080
It's--
I'm good.

517
00:27:47,147 --> 00:27:48,414
- Great.
- I am.

518
00:27:48,515 --> 00:27:52,085
I said great.
I get it.

519
00:27:52,186 --> 00:27:55,188
People are generally
disappointing.

520
00:27:55,289 --> 00:27:59,092
Yeah, be ready to pull a
ripcord at a moment's notice.

521
00:27:59,193 --> 00:28:01,961
Like if you're messing around
with some loser who…

522
00:28:02,062 --> 00:28:06,032
too obsessed with kid's books
to acknowledge he even sees you.

523
00:28:06,133 --> 00:28:08,468
Ripcord.

524
00:28:11,906 --> 00:28:14,340
Are you okay?

525
00:28:14,441 --> 00:28:16,910
Can I do anything to help?

526
00:28:19,413 --> 00:28:21,481
You want to help me,

527
00:28:21,582 --> 00:28:23,516
go to my room

528
00:28:23,617 --> 00:28:27,453
and find the bag of pills
that's stashed under my desk.

529
00:28:27,554 --> 00:28:29,489
- Pills for what?
- For--I'm a Traveler freak

530
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:31,424
who hears voices
and I do a little

531
00:28:31,525 --> 00:28:32,859
or a lot of self-medicating

532
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,029
to get them to shut
their scream-holes.

533
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,530
Penny.

534
00:28:37,631 --> 00:28:39,499
Alice, I don't need
any judgment.

535
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,401
No, Penny.

536
00:28:41,502 --> 00:28:43,336
Oh, okay.

537
00:28:46,473 --> 00:28:47,941
Hey, look.

538
00:28:50,344 --> 00:28:53,112
That's--that's not great.

539
00:28:53,213 --> 00:28:54,914
Can someone get Quentin?

540
00:28:55,015 --> 00:28:56,382
Now!

541
00:28:56,483 --> 00:28:58,751
This is not what I pictured.

542
00:28:58,852 --> 00:29:01,154
It's from the fourth
Fillory book.

543
00:29:01,255 --> 00:29:03,423
I read them all for research.

544
00:29:03,524 --> 00:29:07,293
Yeah, Jane, she was alone
in Fillory for the first time

545
00:29:07,394 --> 00:29:09,429
when she was attacked
by a Lorian assassin.

546
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,090
- What's Lorian?
- They're the bad guys.

547
00:29:11,165 --> 00:29:12,405
Uh, from a neighboring kingdom.

548
00:29:12,433 --> 00:29:13,766
It's actually
really interesting,

549
00:29:13,867 --> 00:29:16,302
because Fillory is both,
the name of the landmass

550
00:29:16,403 --> 00:29:17,637
and also the one
of the sovereign states--

551
00:29:17,738 --> 00:29:20,506
Quentin, focus, please.

552
00:29:20,607 --> 00:29:21,641
Ah, yeah.

553
00:29:21,742 --> 00:29:26,079
Ah, um, so the Lorian
stabbed Jane

554
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,660
with something
called the Virgo Blade.

555
00:29:27,748 --> 00:29:30,683
And, uh, Rose vines grew
from the wounds--

556
00:29:30,784 --> 00:29:32,986
This seems to be
the way grosser,

557
00:29:33,087 --> 00:29:35,989
less whimsical version of that.

558
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:38,358
Um, this guy, Honeyclaw,
he was taking care of Jane.

559
00:29:38,459 --> 00:29:39,726
Honeyclaw?

560
00:29:39,827 --> 00:29:42,161
- Yeah. A-a talking bear.
- Oh, Jesus.

561
00:29:42,262 --> 00:29:44,702
Honeyclaw said that the vines
would keep growing and growing

562
00:29:44,732 --> 00:29:50,036
until they strangled her heart,
um, but Jane survived.

563
00:29:50,137 --> 00:29:51,604
Penny, I know how to fix this.

564
00:29:55,677 --> 00:29:56,863
Is that a turban?

565
00:29:57,198 --> 00:29:58,757
No, it's your hair.

566
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,584
Sewing is not really my thing.

567
00:30:02,403 --> 00:30:04,471
How is a voodoo doll
is supposed to help me?

568
00:30:04,572 --> 00:30:06,339
Um, so, in the books,

569
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,942
Jane carried this doll with her
everywhere she goes,

570
00:30:09,043 --> 00:30:10,944
and it looks just like her.

571
00:30:11,045 --> 00:30:14,380
And so they realized
that the curse

572
00:30:14,482 --> 00:30:17,684
of the Virgo Blade would accept
the doll as a substitute.

573
00:30:19,153 --> 00:30:21,955
So, we burn a doll?

574
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:48,581
Okay, what else did your dumb
book says?

575
00:30:48,682 --> 00:30:50,550
Henry.

576
00:30:50,651 --> 00:30:52,452
It is considered good form

577
00:30:52,553 --> 00:30:54,587
to announce oneself
to blind people.

578
00:30:54,688 --> 00:30:57,557
My glasses only show me
your outline…vaguely.

579
00:30:57,658 --> 00:31:00,560
In my defense, I was raised
by wolves for a time.

580
00:31:00,661 --> 00:31:03,730
The knife
that Penny was stabbed with…

581
00:31:03,831 --> 00:31:05,431
is from Fillory.

582
00:31:05,533 --> 00:31:09,736
Something called the--
the Virgo Blade.

583
00:31:09,837 --> 00:31:11,905
- And you're familiar?
- Yes.

584
00:31:12,006 --> 00:31:14,407
This is a first.

585
00:31:14,508 --> 00:31:17,143
You should've called for me
much sooner.

586
00:31:17,244 --> 00:31:20,446
Quentin's the most at risk,
but if Penny dies…

587
00:31:20,548 --> 00:31:23,316
This is your mess, Eliza.

588
00:31:24,652 --> 00:31:26,819
Clean it up.

589
00:31:26,921 --> 00:31:32,659
Then, get as far away
from my university as possible.

590
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,061
Do you understand?

591
00:31:40,034 --> 00:31:43,303
Mr. Coldwater, I don't have
a lot of time at the moment.

592
00:31:43,404 --> 00:31:44,837
It is the Beast, isn't it?

593
00:31:44,939 --> 00:31:46,806
And he's from Fillory,
which is real.

594
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:48,474
Of course Fillory is real.

595
00:31:48,576 --> 00:31:50,076
You've known that
since you were a child.

596
00:31:50,177 --> 00:31:52,045
It's why you're here.

597
00:31:52,146 --> 00:31:54,314
Okay, but there's no Beast
in the books.

598
00:31:54,415 --> 00:31:57,150
The books are a child's
drawing of Fillory.

599
00:31:57,251 --> 00:31:59,519
The real thing is stranger.

600
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,721
Yeah, it's full
of psychopathic monsters

601
00:32:01,822 --> 00:32:02,989
who are trying to kill me.

602
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,650
You want to know
what the Beast wants?

603
00:32:04,692 --> 00:32:06,025
I'll tell you exactly.

604
00:32:06,126 --> 00:32:07,994
He wants control of Fillory

605
00:32:08,095 --> 00:32:09,529
and all the doors
that lead there.

606
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:13,299
Maybe, he thinks
you'll find one of them.

607
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,069
- I'm not a Traveler.
- There are other ways.

608
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,570
I gave you a book about it.

609
00:32:17,671 --> 00:32:19,706
"Fillory and Further, Book Six"?

610
00:32:19,807 --> 00:32:20,873
I told you.
I lost it.

611
00:32:20,975 --> 00:32:23,610
And nothing lost was ever found?

612
00:32:23,711 --> 00:32:25,278
Wait, there's, uh--
What about Penny?

613
00:32:25,379 --> 00:32:26,646
There's got to be
something we can do.

614
00:32:26,747 --> 00:32:29,382
You need to read between
the lines, Quentin.

615
00:32:29,483 --> 00:32:33,286
Jane's doll wasn't special
because it looked like Jane.

616
00:32:33,387 --> 00:32:36,322
Was special because
of where it came from.

617
00:32:36,423 --> 00:32:39,325
<i>Jane's mother gave it to her…</i>

618
00:32:39,426 --> 00:32:41,427
<i>before she died.</i>

619
00:32:43,631 --> 00:32:47,033
<i>It was all she took with her
to Fillory.</i>

620
00:32:47,134 --> 00:32:50,870
<i>Her only reminder of her family
and her life on Earth.</i>

621
00:32:50,971 --> 00:32:54,707
<i>It was her most precious
possession.</i>

622
00:32:54,808 --> 00:32:58,344
<i>What we love can be as
important to us as our lives.</i>

623
00:32:58,445 --> 00:33:01,981
So, the curse accepted the doll

624
00:33:02,082 --> 00:33:04,951
as a proper sacrifice
in place of Jane's heart.

625
00:33:07,554 --> 00:33:10,289
I know you have more questions

626
00:33:10,391 --> 00:33:12,992
after you save your friend.

627
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:18,731
I found a way to break
the curse,

628
00:33:18,832 --> 00:33:20,933
I just need a--
Penny!

629
00:33:21,035 --> 00:33:24,170
Hey, asshole, I need to know
your most precious possession.

630
00:33:24,271 --> 00:33:26,339
He's been out of it for like,
20 minutes.

631
00:33:28,475 --> 00:33:30,343
Then, it's too late.

632
00:33:46,593 --> 00:33:51,097
I beseech and devote myself.

633
00:33:52,366 --> 00:33:55,968
I plead and promise myself…

634
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,837
to you,

635
00:33:57,938 --> 00:34:00,173
She of the Grain,

636
00:34:00,274 --> 00:34:04,077
that you would raise me
up above the chaff.

637
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,947
Amen?

638
00:34:08,048 --> 00:34:09,415
<i>♪ You can still be ♪</i>

639
00:34:09,516 --> 00:34:11,451
<i>♪ What you want to</i> ♪

640
00:34:11,552 --> 00:34:13,853

<i>♪ You ♪</i>

646
00:34:33,474 --> 00:34:37,543
<i>♪ You ♪</i>

647
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:40,744
How are we supposed to know
what's important?

648
00:34:40,984 --> 00:34:42,284
I don't know. Penny doesn't
have that much stuff,

649
00:34:42,386 --> 00:34:45,688
we'll just go through it.

650
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:49,505
Pictures.
Yeah, maybe it's something

651
00:34:49,606 --> 00:34:50,939
from his childhood, his family.

652
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,541
He doesn't ever talk about them.

653
00:34:52,642 --> 00:34:53,876
Doesn't mean he doesn't care
about them.

654
00:34:53,977 --> 00:34:55,711
Penny's not
the most sentimental type.

655
00:34:55,812 --> 00:34:57,846
Well, maybe he carefully
crafts that image,

656
00:34:57,947 --> 00:34:59,715
I don't know.
Everyone is sentimental.

657
00:34:59,816 --> 00:35:02,484
- You're projecting.
- You're projecting!

658
00:35:04,487 --> 00:35:06,522
Okay.

659
00:35:06,623 --> 00:35:09,124
I'm getting a definite
circus clown vibe here.

660
00:35:09,225 --> 00:35:10,993
Q, this is it.

661
00:35:11,094 --> 00:35:13,629
You think, Penny's most prized
possession is his Adderall?

662
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:15,397
I have voices telling me,
all day long,

663
00:35:15,498 --> 00:35:16,999
to do dark magic
and I don't know,

664
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,834
the pills were the one thing
that make them stop,

665
00:35:18,935 --> 00:35:20,536
- they'd be pretty precious.
- You can always get more pills.

666

00:06:52,691 --> 00:06:54,408
Well, you've never
mentioned that before.

134
00:06:54,443 --> 00:06:56,193
Well, we've never been
this desperate before.

135
00:06:56,195 --> 00:06:57,694
Okay, so we're all in agreement.

136
00:06:57,746 --> 00:07:00,697
We should ask the lizard man.

137
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:02,532
What?

138
00:07:02,534 --> 00:07:05,035
The lizard man over there.

139
00:07:05,037 --> 00:07:07,371
Eliot.
Honey, what are you on?

140
00:07:07,423 --> 00:07:09,256
Some pinks, a green,

141
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:13,043
and a tab of something called
"chocolate sunshine."

142
00:07:13,045 --> 00:07:15,212
I really like the name.
Do you like the name?

143
00:07:16,215 --> 00:07:19,182
Uh.

144
00:07:19,218 --> 00:07:21,017
Maybe I shouldn't have
had that green.

145
00:07:21,053 --> 00:07:23,103
Maybe you should get
checked out at the infirmary.

146
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,773
That's nonsense.

147
00:07:26,809 --> 00:07:29,609
Me strong like bull.

148
00:07:29,645 --> 00:07:31,695
Let's go on a quest.

149
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,564
You two go talk
to Alice's whatever.

150
00:07:34,616 --> 00:07:37,567
Eliot, honey, maybe you and I
should go upstairs and rest.

151
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:38,902
Wait, wait, wait.

152
00:07:40,456 --> 00:07:42,873
Are my eyes open
or closed right now?

153
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,080
How about now?

154
00:07:53,585 --> 00:07:54,751
Shit.

155
00:09:05,057 --> 00:09:06,173
Shit.

156
00:09:06,175 --> 00:09:07,424
Uh, coming!

157
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:11,561
Don't worry.
It's only me.

158
00:09:11,597 --> 00:09:12,979
I was just checking
the Free Trader app

159
00:09:13,015 --> 00:09:15,015
to see if you'd imploded.

160
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:16,349
I kept that offline.

161
00:09:16,351 --> 00:09:20,187
Uh, so…
what do I call you?

162
00:09:20,189 --> 00:09:23,657
Like, Richard
or Failstaff or--

163
00:09:23,692 --> 00:09:25,192
Richard,
though some of the others

164
00:09:25,244 --> 00:09:26,693
might prefer
their log-in names.

165
00:09:26,695 --> 00:09:29,529
Hey, when was the last time
you unplugged?

166
00:09:29,531 --> 00:09:31,665
- It's been a while.
- Oh.

167
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,333
But, I mean,
when was the last time

168
00:09:33,368 --> 00:09:37,204
I had actual friends to discuss
"Godel, Escher, Bach" with?

169
00:09:37,256 --> 00:09:39,539
But listen. The portals
are gonna take me a couple hours

170
00:09:39,591 --> 00:09:42,676
to calculate if you want to,
you know, straighten up.

171
00:09:42,711 --> 00:09:44,377
Thank God.

172
00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:45,879
Listen, do you mind
if we commandeer the guest room

173
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:47,380
for the project?

174
00:09:47,432 --> 00:09:49,349
Um, what project?

175
00:09:49,384 --> 00:09:51,184
Aha.

176
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,721
Ah, you and Asmodeus will learn
more once you've leveled up.

177
00:09:54,723 --> 00:09:56,189
The next 12 spells.

178
00:09:56,225 --> 00:09:57,724
No mistakes.

179
00:09:57,776 --> 00:09:59,226
Wow.

180
00:09:59,228 --> 00:10:01,778
"The," um…

181
00:10:01,813 --> 00:10:04,531
"The Spellbinder"?

182
00:10:04,566 --> 00:10:07,033
I mean, it was right there.

183
00:10:07,069 --> 00:10:08,735
Mm.

184
00:10:08,737 --> 00:10:10,871
Yeah, because it's
a binder filled with spells.

185
00:10:26,505 --> 00:10:27,754
Hi.

186
00:10:29,591 --> 00:10:32,092
You must be Vicious Circe.

187
00:10:32,094 --> 00:10:33,094
I'm Silver.

188
00:10:36,815 --> 00:10:37,815
- Hi.
- Bender.

189
00:10:37,849 --> 00:10:39,566
Thanks for having me.

190
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:41,268
I'm extremely happy finally
to meet you face-to-face.

191
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,153
I've taken the liberty of
writing a cooperative variation

192
00:10:43,188 --> 00:10:44,654
on the spell
I sent you last week.

193
00:10:46,108 --> 00:10:48,275
Menolly.
Finally, in person.

194
00:10:49,328 --> 00:10:50,328
How you feeling?

195
00:10:50,362 --> 00:10:52,279
So good.

196
00:10:52,331 --> 00:10:54,948
I am danked
as shit right now, girl.

197
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,083
The perks of chemo
just keep rolling in.

198
00:10:58,704 --> 00:11:00,120
Hi.

199
00:11:00,172 --> 00:11:02,505
Asmodeus is the last one.

200
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,674
She's actually just
coming from uptown,

201
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:07,460
but rush hour, you know.

202
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:13,466
- Hi.
- Asmodeus.

203
00:11:13,468 --> 00:11:14,935
Welcome.

204
00:11:18,557 --> 00:11:19,973
You two know each other.

205
00:11:23,145 --> 00:11:27,314
Obviously I didn't realize
that you two had history,

206
00:11:27,366 --> 00:11:29,282
and I don't want to dismiss it,

207
00:11:29,318 --> 00:11:30,817
but we are running
out of time here,

208
00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:34,120
and we need both of you.

209
00:11:34,156 --> 00:11:36,039
Okay?

210
00:11:36,074 --> 00:11:37,624
Of course.

211
00:11:40,746 --> 00:11:42,662
I've never been
to Chicago before.

212
00:11:42,664 --> 00:11:44,214
This isn't Chicago;
it's the 'burbs.

213
00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:45,632
We should make this fast.

214
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:47,167
Maybe you can wait outside
while I run in.

215
00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:48,501
Come on, Vix,
when are you gonna tell me

216
00:11:48,553 --> 00:11:49,502
who we're here to see?

217
00:11:49,554 --> 00:11:50,804
What's the big secret?

218
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:52,555
Just let me do the talking.

219
00:12:05,737 --> 00:12:08,238
Jesus, it's like
the TARDIS in here.

220
00:12:08,273 --> 00:12:09,990
What kind of magic
are these people using?

221
00:12:10,025 --> 00:12:12,025
Thibadeau's Planar Compression.

222
00:12:12,077 --> 00:12:13,410
It's really not a big deal.

223
00:12:13,445 --> 00:12:16,079
Alice, who's house
is this, exactly?

224
00:12:16,114 --> 00:12:17,697
Alice.

225
00:12:20,752 --> 00:12:22,535
Hi, Dad.

226
00:12:28,154 --> 00:12:30,062
Come, come, come, come.

227
00:12:30,647 --> 00:12:32,897
So glad you guys could make it
for the Veneralia,

228
00:12:32,933 --> 00:12:35,733
the Roman festival of Venus.

229
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:37,936
Did Alice tell you
I study historical magic?

230
00:12:37,938 --> 00:12:41,105
We celebrate all the Roman
holidays around here.

231
00:12:42,609 --> 00:12:44,075
Jesus Christ,
how come you didn't tell me

232
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,577
we were coming
to see your parents?

233
00:12:45,612 --> 00:12:46,911
Because I knew you'd make
a big deal out of it

234
00:12:46,947 --> 00:12:48,279
and act like this.

235
00:12:48,281 --> 00:12:50,248
Well--I--
so they're travelers?

236
00:12:50,283 --> 00:12:51,449
Amongst other things?

237
00:12:51,501 --> 00:12:52,784
No, my mom just
knows a traveler.

238
00:12:52,836 --> 00:12:54,118
Look, it's complicated.
Just--shh.

239
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,787
Let me handle it.

240
00:12:55,789 --> 00:12:57,789
Really hope you can
come back for the Saturnalia.

241
00:12:57,841 --> 00:13:00,842
Much less tame
than this whole thing.

242
00:13:00,877 --> 00:13:02,961
- Right. This is a little tame.
- Hmm.

243
00:13:02,963 --> 00:13:04,596
Dad, I need to talk
to Mom, like, now.

244
00:13:04,631 --> 00:13:05,631
It's important.

245
00:13:05,682 --> 00:13:07,515
Well, after a frolic,

246
00:13:07,551 --> 00:13:09,300
she'll usually head
for the tepidarium.

247
00:13:09,302 --> 00:13:10,935
Can you please
just call it the bath?

248
00:13:10,971 --> 00:13:13,304
Nonsense.
This is my domus.

249
00:13:13,356 --> 00:13:15,306
I shall call it what I please.

250
00:13:15,308 --> 00:13:17,525
Ugh.

251
00:13:17,561 --> 00:13:19,777
Okay, look.

252
00:13:19,813 --> 00:13:22,647
Distract my dad.
I'll be 30 minutes, tops.

253
00:13:22,649 --> 00:13:25,033
Please?

254
00:13:28,705 --> 00:13:31,623
So, dating my daughter, eh?

255
00:13:33,376 --> 00:13:35,827
Let's have a little
fatherly chat.

256
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,165
I can't believe
I gave up tickets

257
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:42,834
to "Hamilton" for this.

258
00:13:42,836 --> 00:13:45,720
Um, sorry you have
to do your job.

259
00:13:45,755 --> 00:13:47,805
Ugh, story of my life.

260
00:13:47,841 --> 00:13:49,724
Anyway, there's nothing
wrong with him.

261
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:51,643
Really?
Nothing at all?

262
00:13:51,678 --> 00:13:53,811
Well, he has
a massive drug problem,

263
00:13:53,847 --> 00:13:56,064
but at least
he's medicating, hmm?

264
00:13:56,099 --> 00:13:57,515
Ah.

265
00:13:57,567 --> 00:13:59,400
- Thank you.
- Hmm.

266
00:13:59,436 --> 00:14:00,685
You, on the other hand,

267
00:14:00,737 --> 00:14:03,404
appear to require
medical intervention.

268
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,522
What?

269
00:14:11,915 --> 00:14:12,915
That was me?

270
00:14:12,949 --> 00:14:14,699
Yep.

271
00:14:14,751 --> 00:14:17,535
Something's draining
her chi, her life force--

272
00:14:17,537 --> 00:14:18,920
or someone.

273
00:14:18,955 --> 00:14:21,756
So, okay, I know that
this is embarrassing,

274
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,374
but trust me, dying is worse.

275
00:14:23,376 --> 00:14:25,510
Have you engaged
in any unprotected rituals

276
00:14:25,545 --> 00:14:27,762
of any kind?

277
00:14:27,797 --> 00:14:29,013
Be honest.

278
00:14:30,884 --> 00:14:32,183
God.

279
00:14:32,218 --> 00:14:34,385
That son of a bitch.

280
00:14:36,806 --> 00:14:39,223
They're chanting something.

281
00:14:39,225 --> 00:14:40,892
Uh, look.
We should get started.

282
00:14:40,944 --> 00:14:43,061
We have a lot of spells
to get through.

283
00:14:46,066 --> 00:14:49,734
You know, first,
I just want to be clear.

284
00:14:49,736 --> 00:14:52,203
Richard might be
about forgiveness,

285
00:14:52,238 --> 00:14:53,905
but I'm sure as shit not.

286
00:14:53,907 --> 00:14:55,239
Look, I'm sorry you and your mom

287
00:14:55,241 --> 00:14:57,041
had a shitty relationship,

288
00:14:57,077 --> 00:14:59,961
but not a day goes by
where I don't feel terrible

289
00:14:59,996 --> 00:15:01,579
about what happened to her.

290
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,414
I did not cause her death, okay?

291
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,633
I only wish that
I could've stopped it.

292
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:07,752
I'm just trying to make up
for my past,

293
00:15:07,754 --> 00:15:09,087
just like you.

294
00:15:12,308 --> 00:15:13,591
Did she suffer?

295
00:15:19,482 --> 00:15:21,432
She said she loved you.

296
00:15:21,484 --> 00:15:23,685
Yeah, I know she did.

297
00:15:28,858 --> 00:15:31,109
So are we gonna do this,
or what?

298
00:15:41,788 --> 00:15:43,621
Whoa.

299
00:15:43,673 --> 00:15:45,256
William.

300
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:46,791
You're late.

301
00:15:46,843 --> 00:15:49,093
I'm what?
Who are you?

302
00:15:49,129 --> 00:15:51,462
You always ask
the same questions.

303
00:15:51,464 --> 00:15:53,181
I don't know
what you're talking about.

304
00:15:53,216 --> 00:15:54,599
You never do.

305
00:15:54,634 --> 00:15:56,300
I'm a member of The Order,

306
00:15:56,352 --> 00:15:58,603
the keepers of the libraries
of the Neitherlands,

307
00:15:58,638 --> 00:16:01,139
the greatest repository
of knowledge, full stop.

308
00:16:02,976 --> 00:16:04,816
Any idea who the motherfuckers
in the hoods are

309
00:16:04,861 --> 00:16:06,611
that are trying to kill me?

310
00:16:06,646 --> 00:16:09,480
The locals used to work for us
in a custodial function,

311
00:16:09,482 --> 00:16:12,784
but labor relations
have become somewhat…

312
00:16:12,819 --> 00:16:14,485
strained of late.

313
00:16:14,487 --> 00:16:16,370
We had to ban them
from the libraries.

314
00:16:16,406 --> 00:16:18,456
They've been thoroughly cursed,
so they can't use the fountains,

315
00:16:18,491 --> 00:16:21,125
but that hasn't stopped them
from finding other employment,

316
00:16:21,161 --> 00:16:24,712
some with a particularly
nasty entity.

317
00:16:24,748 --> 00:16:26,330
The Beast?

318
00:16:26,382 --> 00:16:28,049
Well, he has many names.

319
00:16:28,084 --> 00:16:30,134
Look, this is all great,

320
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:33,337
but I'm just trying to get back
to the Earth fountain.

321
00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:34,555
Can you show me where it is?

322
00:16:34,591 --> 00:16:36,174
I suppose
I could order you a map,

323
00:16:36,226 --> 00:16:37,866
but it'd have to come
from another branch.

324
00:16:37,894 --> 00:16:39,343
Great, let's do that.

325
00:16:39,395 --> 00:16:40,845
Interlibrary loans
typically take

326
00:16:40,847 --> 00:16:42,513
two to four weeks to process.

327
00:16:42,515 --> 00:16:44,682
Are you kidding?
That's two years on my world.

328
00:16:44,734 --> 00:16:47,235
Then I'm afraid we are limited

329
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,854
to the resources of this branch.

330
00:16:51,908 --> 00:16:53,191
Follow me.

331
00:16:59,365 --> 00:17:00,531
Alice?

332
00:17:03,787 --> 00:17:06,087
Hi, Mom.

333
00:17:06,122 --> 00:17:08,840
Alice.

334
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:11,042
Fine.

335
00:17:11,044 --> 00:17:12,543
Stephanie.

336
00:17:12,545 --> 00:17:14,712
You know how
I feel about "Mom."

337
00:17:14,714 --> 00:17:17,598
I just--I have an important
question to ask you.

338
00:17:17,634 --> 00:17:19,600
Sure.

339
00:17:19,636 --> 00:17:21,936
Push past everything
you left on the table

340
00:17:21,971 --> 00:17:24,388
the last time we spoke.

341
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,390
I'm sure you've forgotten
all about it.

342
00:17:26,392 --> 00:17:27,892
Oh, my God.

343
00:17:27,944 --> 00:17:29,704
You're really not gonna
let that go, are you?

344
00:17:29,729 --> 00:17:32,780
Because we haven't
finished discussing it.

345
00:17:32,816 --> 00:17:34,448
It was six months ago.

346
00:17:37,403 --> 00:17:40,121
Look, I just--

347
00:17:40,156 --> 00:17:43,074
Mom--Stephanie,

348
00:17:43,076 --> 00:17:44,716
I don't see the point
in talking about it.

349
00:17:44,744 --> 00:17:46,544
We don't agree on it,
and we're never going to.

350
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:48,913
Well, because you act like
there's something wrong with me.

351
00:17:48,965 --> 00:17:50,715
No, I just think
it's weird that you--

352
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:53,885
you're not at all curious
about what happened to Charlie.

353
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,419
It's not gonna bring him back,

354
00:17:55,471 --> 00:17:57,922
so I don't want to know…

355
00:18:00,844 --> 00:18:02,476
Which is a perfectly
reasonable position

356
00:18:02,512 --> 00:18:04,729
in spite of how you judge me.

357
00:18:04,764 --> 00:18:07,398
Fine.
Okay, fine.

358
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:09,767
Okay, I don't need
that patronizing tone.

359
00:18:09,769 --> 00:18:11,152
Then what do you want from me?

360
00:18:11,187 --> 00:18:14,989
How about…
hmm…

361
00:18:15,024 --> 00:18:18,326
you admit that your mother
is a human being,

362
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:20,278
because you act
like you're the only one

363
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,497
who has a right to feel.

364
00:18:23,533 --> 00:18:25,616
No, I don't.

365
00:18:25,618 --> 00:18:27,501
I just--

366
00:18:27,537 --> 00:18:30,454
Okay.

367
00:18:30,456 --> 00:18:32,506
I think we're done talking.

368
00:18:32,542 --> 00:18:36,127
This conversation
has worn me out entirely.

369
00:18:37,463 --> 00:18:38,796
Excuse me.

370
00:18:58,066 --> 00:18:59,986
Evert second I spend in
this place, it's just…

371
00:19:00,185 --> 00:19:02,319
I just feel like I'm being
pulled back into this version

372
00:19:02,354 --> 00:19:03,820
of me when I was, like,
12 and furious

373
00:19:03,855 --> 00:19:06,273
and invisible and mute.

374
00:19:07,178 --> 00:19:09,311
Ugh, she just fucking
does that to me.

375
00:19:09,346 --> 00:19:12,014
Well, I'm sure being cooped up
in your old room helps.

376
00:19:12,016 --> 00:19:14,850
It's like going back
in time to 2004.

377
00:19:14,902 --> 00:19:16,685
The "Garden State" soundtrack.

378
00:19:16,737 --> 00:19:18,437
Hey, that was cool
when it came out.

379
00:19:21,192 --> 00:19:23,525
"The Joy of Sex"?

380
00:19:23,527 --> 00:19:25,194
Is that, uh, Stephanie?

381
00:19:25,196 --> 00:19:27,412
My dad.

382
00:19:27,448 --> 00:19:29,031
He meant well.

383
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,999
But my mom made him give me
the version from the '70s

384
00:19:31,035 --> 00:19:32,367
because she thinks
that kids should know

385
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:33,702
what pubic hair looks like.

386
00:19:33,704 --> 00:19:35,504
Jesus Christ.

387
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:39,374
I can't imagine what you must
be thinking of me right now.

388
00:19:39,376 --> 00:19:40,842
It's cool.

389
00:19:40,878 --> 00:19:45,097
I'm, like, really
into damaged chicks.

390
00:19:45,132 --> 00:19:48,183
Like Julia?

391
00:19:48,219 --> 00:19:50,018
Alice, I don't know what
you think Julia and I were,

392
00:19:50,054 --> 00:19:53,889
but the truth is
that we weren't anything.

393
00:19:53,941 --> 00:19:56,058
We were two kids
who tested well,

394
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,893
got placed together,
and I got a crush

395
00:19:57,945 --> 00:19:59,278
because that's
how hormones work,

396
00:19:59,313 --> 00:20:00,946
and she didn't,
and I got over it,

397
00:20:00,981 --> 00:20:03,365
and the end.

398
00:20:07,571 --> 00:20:09,955
I'm kind of new
to this whole thing,

399
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,740
if you hadn't guessed.

400
00:20:11,742 --> 00:20:15,460
All my past relationships were,
like, you know, at a party.

401
00:20:15,496 --> 00:20:19,464
"Can we just do this
standing up?" kind of thing.

402
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,300
Well, the fact
that you could want

403
00:20:21,335 --> 00:20:22,918
to have sex with anyone

404
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,921
after living in this house
is pretty impressive.

405
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:30,175
Thanks.

406
00:20:34,682 --> 00:20:36,565
So what's the deal
with this traveler?

407
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,767
Why can't we just ask?

408
00:20:38,819 --> 00:20:40,102
I mean…

409
00:20:40,104 --> 00:20:41,903
Okay, so…

410
00:20:43,857 --> 00:20:47,075
My mom knows this traveler
from another world, Joe.

411
00:20:47,111 --> 00:20:48,610
- Joe?
- Yeah.

412
00:20:48,612 --> 00:20:50,495
Apparently his actual name
is impossible to pronounce.

413
00:20:50,531 --> 00:20:52,781
Anyway, it's kind of
a touchy subject,

414
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,167
and I think that it's best
that when I talk to my mom,

415
00:20:55,202 --> 00:20:56,451
my dad's not around.

416
00:20:56,453 --> 00:20:58,420
Why?
Is she sleeping with Joe?

417
00:21:00,841 --> 00:21:02,507
And your dad doesn't know?

418
00:21:02,543 --> 00:21:07,129
Alice, they were having
a sex party when we showed up.

419
00:21:07,131 --> 00:21:08,930
Look, I know
it sounds ridiculous,

420
00:21:08,966 --> 00:21:12,434
but my parents
are weird and possessive,

421
00:21:12,469 --> 00:21:14,770
and they just have
to do everything together.

422
00:21:15,973 --> 00:21:18,607
Look, when I was ten,

423
00:21:18,642 --> 00:21:20,359
my dad caught my mom
having an affair,

424
00:21:20,394 --> 00:21:23,278
and he threatened
to commit suicide.

425
00:21:25,316 --> 00:21:26,982
Oh, my God.

426
00:21:27,034 --> 00:21:29,151
He said he had to go extreme
just to get her attention,

427
00:21:29,153 --> 00:21:31,486
which--he was psychotic,

428
00:21:31,538 --> 00:21:33,822
but he wasn't wrong.

429
00:21:36,076 --> 00:21:39,378
I think he would have done it
if she hadn't come around.

430
00:21:41,665 --> 00:21:42,831
Well…

431
00:21:46,253 --> 00:21:48,503
Now I kind of feel like
a dick for making fun

432
00:21:48,555 --> 00:21:50,389
of your "Garden State"
soundtrack.

433
00:21:52,893 --> 00:21:54,676
Total dick.

434
00:21:54,728 --> 00:21:56,511
Now you have to help me.

435
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,860
I think that was
one of your memories.

436
00:22:11,912 --> 00:22:14,029
Yeah.

437
00:22:14,031 --> 00:22:16,331
- Antarctica.
- Jesus.

438
00:22:16,367 --> 00:22:18,417
What brought you there?

439
00:22:18,452 --> 00:22:21,002
Brakebills.

440
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:22,704
So what happened?

441
00:22:22,706 --> 00:22:24,339
I mean, why'd you leave?

442
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,708
They found out my deal,

443
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,178
and it was either stay
and get brain-wiped

444
00:22:30,214 --> 00:22:32,347
or jet.

445
00:22:32,383 --> 00:22:34,015
I was heading to New York.

446
00:22:34,051 --> 00:22:37,219
I was coming to kill Marina.

447
00:22:37,271 --> 00:22:39,888
Well, then what happened?

448
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:42,524
I met Richard,

449
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,445
and he convinced me
Marina could wait

450
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,365
and invited me to join
the Free Trader Beowulf,

451
00:22:50,401 --> 00:22:53,735
which sounded--
I don't know--

452
00:22:53,787 --> 00:22:57,289
maybe better than death
or jail, so--

453
00:23:01,412 --> 00:23:03,378
Uh, everything okay in there?

454
00:23:03,414 --> 00:23:05,046
Yeah, great.
All good.

455
00:23:05,082 --> 00:23:07,048
I know a hundred ways
to break in.

456
00:23:07,084 --> 00:23:08,417
We have four spells left.

457
00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:09,801
Let's just finish, okay?

458
00:23:09,837 --> 00:23:12,421
Then they have to let us in
on their project.

459
00:23:15,476 --> 00:23:17,592
Just a little further.

460
00:23:20,597 --> 00:23:23,315
Wait a minute.
I--I know these people.

461
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,983
Well, every book is here--

462
00:23:25,018 --> 00:23:27,402
all the books ever written,
all the books never written,

463
00:23:27,438 --> 00:23:30,272
all the books of all the people
who ever lived.

464
00:23:30,324 --> 00:23:31,940
This is my book.

465
00:23:31,942 --> 00:23:33,742
Yo.

466
00:23:33,777 --> 00:23:36,278
Why are there all these flowers
and shit on the cover?

467
00:23:38,365 --> 00:23:40,248
People who read
their books often discover

468
00:23:40,284 --> 00:23:42,784
they don't like
the main character

469
00:23:42,836 --> 00:23:45,420
and are rarely happy
with how it ends.

470
00:23:52,129 --> 00:23:55,597
Ah.
Here it is.

471
00:23:55,632 --> 00:23:57,966
Wait, Martin?
That's--

472
00:23:58,018 --> 00:23:59,634
That's one of the Fillory kids.

473
00:23:59,636 --> 00:24:01,603
Okay, is there anything
in there about The Beast?

474
00:24:01,638 --> 00:24:03,605
I'm sorry.
I can't lend you this.

475
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,607
Not without a library card.

476
00:24:06,894 --> 00:24:08,026
Course you can't.

477
00:24:11,031 --> 00:24:13,281
You know, shit like this is
why people hate librarians.

478
00:24:14,985 --> 00:24:16,952
What are you doing?

479
00:24:16,987 --> 00:24:19,654
Here's what would happen
if we did what you're thinking:

480
00:24:19,706 --> 00:24:22,123
you'd try to steal
this book by force,

481
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,959
we'd fight, you'd lose,

482
00:24:23,994 --> 00:24:25,494
but you'd rip out several pages

483
00:24:25,496 --> 00:24:29,998
before I banished you
from the library.

484
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,334
This way, no books get hurt.

485
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,901
Ff…

486
00:24:49,937 --> 00:24:51,653
I hate this place.

487
00:24:56,066 --> 00:24:57,668
***

488
00:24:57,908 --> 00:24:59,541
Oh, here.
You have to try this.

489
00:24:59,576 --> 00:25:00,576
Mmm.

490
00:25:01,912 --> 00:25:04,546
- Filleted goat penis.
- Mmm.

491
00:25:04,581 --> 00:25:06,748
Promotes virility.
Hmm?

492
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,750
That's very thoughtful
of you, Dad.

493
00:25:08,752 --> 00:25:09,751
Oh.

494
00:25:13,807 --> 00:25:17,425
So, Daniel, you were saying
that your discipline

495
00:25:17,477 --> 00:25:18,810
is in historical magic.

496
00:25:18,845 --> 00:25:20,095
Indeed.
Ah.

497
00:25:20,097 --> 00:25:22,430
The Romans still fascinate me.

498
00:25:22,482 --> 00:25:24,432
In fact, I'm about
to publish my third volume

499
00:25:24,484 --> 00:25:27,152
on illusion work
of the Collis Aventinus.

500
00:25:27,187 --> 00:25:28,770
Oh, could I see it?

501
00:25:28,822 --> 00:25:30,438
Well, it's still in galleys,

502
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:31,773
but I suppose
I could show you--

503
00:25:31,775 --> 00:25:33,274
Oh, great.
Uh, that sounds great.

504
00:25:33,327 --> 00:25:34,826
Could we--which--
let's go now.

505
00:25:34,861 --> 00:25:36,501
But you haven't even
touched your penis.

506
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:38,113
You know what?
I had a ton of it yesterday.

507
00:25:38,115 --> 00:25:39,280
You said that it was this way.

508
00:25:39,282 --> 00:25:41,282
Yeah, yeah.
Uh, well…

509
00:25:44,621 --> 00:25:46,621
Stephanie…

510
00:25:46,623 --> 00:25:48,623
I was wrong, and you were right,

511
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:52,127
and I promise to be a better
daughter in the future.

512
00:25:52,129 --> 00:25:54,763
Right about what?

513
00:25:54,798 --> 00:25:57,916
I couldn't possibly know
how you feel

514
00:25:57,918 --> 00:26:00,251
other than that you feel deeply,

515
00:26:00,253 --> 00:26:02,671
and you are your own person,

516
00:26:02,723 --> 00:26:04,389
and you're the only one

517
00:26:04,424 --> 00:26:06,257
who knows how to deal
with your stuff,

518
00:26:06,259 --> 00:26:07,809
and it was wrong
of me to presume.

519
00:26:07,861 --> 00:26:09,978
♪

520
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,980
Was that really
so tough, sweetie?

521
00:26:13,867 --> 00:26:17,652
Look, I know this
is a tricky subject,

522
00:26:17,654 --> 00:26:19,120
but my friend's life
is in danger,

523
00:26:19,156 --> 00:26:21,322
and I need to talk
to you about Joe.

524
00:26:21,324 --> 00:26:22,824
Joe.
Oh!

525
00:26:22,826 --> 00:26:24,492
I love Joe!

526
00:26:25,996 --> 00:26:28,329
Would you hand me
that minced parrot, please?

527
00:26:28,331 --> 00:26:29,831
Wait.
I don't understand.

528
00:26:29,883 --> 00:26:31,216
I thought you wouldn't
want Dad to hear.

529
00:26:32,335 --> 00:26:33,668
Why on earth not?

530
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,004
Because it could
destroy your marriage.

531
00:26:36,006 --> 00:26:39,174
What?
Your father loves Joe.

532
00:26:39,176 --> 00:26:40,475
I don't understand.

533
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,726
I thought you were
hiding him from him.

534
00:26:41,762 --> 00:26:43,011
Nope.

535
00:26:43,013 --> 00:26:46,314
Alice, you make me
sound so melodramatic.

536
00:26:47,567 --> 00:26:49,150
Fine, yes, sure.

537
00:26:49,186 --> 00:26:51,319
At first, yeah,

538
00:26:51,354 --> 00:26:53,188
your father
was a touch sensitive,

539
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,356
but then he figured out

540
00:26:55,358 --> 00:26:57,192
that Joe could work
for both of us,

541
00:26:57,244 --> 00:26:59,244
so now he's our third,

542
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:04,699
you know, in a sort of
polyamorous-triad sense.

543
00:27:04,701 --> 00:27:07,419
- So you and Joe and--
- Yeah.

544
00:27:07,454 --> 00:27:09,421
Joe's anatomy is adaptable.

545
00:27:09,456 --> 00:27:11,039
He's like a Swiss Army knife.

546
00:27:11,041 --> 00:27:13,174
He's good for every occasion.

547
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:16,845
So whatever do you
want with Joe?

548
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,215
- I need his help.
- Oh, sweetie.

549
00:27:20,217 --> 00:27:22,434
I'm sure Quentin
will understand.

550
00:27:33,447 --> 00:27:37,232
You see two of you too, right?

551
00:27:37,234 --> 00:27:39,067
Okay, good.

552
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:40,799
This stuff is finally
starting to wear off.

553
00:27:43,073 --> 00:27:44,906
Margo.

554
00:27:44,908 --> 00:27:46,074
Uh, I can explain.

555
00:27:46,126 --> 00:27:49,744
Explain this, you dick!

556
00:27:51,631 --> 00:27:53,298
Hi.

557
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:55,049
I'm Eliot.

558
00:27:56,753 --> 00:27:58,920
So what's up?
How can I help?

559
00:27:58,972 --> 00:28:00,755
Please know I'm
a certified therapist at home

560
00:28:00,757 --> 00:28:02,257
as well as here.

561
00:28:02,259 --> 00:28:03,475
You can trust me completely.

562
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:05,093
No, no, no.

563
00:28:05,095 --> 00:28:07,762
Like I said, our friend
is trapped in the Neitherlands.

564
00:28:07,764 --> 00:28:10,265
- Uh, acquaintance.
- That place is the worst.

565
00:28:10,317 --> 00:28:12,150
So confusing.

566
00:28:12,185 --> 00:28:14,602
Not to mention those fountains.
Completely unpredictable.

567
00:28:14,604 --> 00:28:17,655
Wait, so you know your way
around the Neitherlands?

568
00:28:17,691 --> 00:28:19,774
Could you, like, draw us a map?

569
00:28:21,611 --> 00:28:22,944
Yeah, I guess.

570
00:28:22,946 --> 00:28:24,412
It's not gonna do
your friend any good

571
00:28:24,447 --> 00:28:26,915
if he's very far
from the Earth fountain,

572
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:29,167
although I might have something
that could help with that.

573
00:28:29,202 --> 00:28:31,119
Great.
What?

574
00:28:31,171 --> 00:28:32,670
It's a beacon.

575
00:28:32,706 --> 00:28:34,289
You cast it here,
and the fountain

576
00:28:34,341 --> 00:28:36,007
for this world lights up there.

577
00:28:36,042 --> 00:28:37,792
Okay, so how do we cast it?

578
00:28:37,844 --> 00:28:41,179
Well, there are some
specific requirements…

579
00:28:41,214 --> 00:28:43,765
sexually speaking.

580
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:48,136
Wait.
It's sex magic?

581
00:28:48,188 --> 00:28:50,138
All magic where I'm from
is sex magic.

582
00:28:51,691 --> 00:28:54,442
Thought you knew that.

583
00:28:54,477 --> 00:28:56,811
I could perform it with you
if you'd prefer.

584
00:28:56,863 --> 00:28:58,446
I'm a heck of a pinch hitter.

585
00:28:58,481 --> 00:29:00,648
Think we've got this.

586
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:02,283
All right.
Suit yourself.

587
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:04,319
I sense a nice connection
between your genitals.

588
00:29:04,321 --> 00:29:05,703
You should be fine.

589
00:29:05,739 --> 00:29:07,989
You just need some blood,

590
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:09,490
a globe,

591
00:29:09,492 --> 00:29:11,326
a few candles bound with twine.

592
00:29:11,378 --> 00:29:15,997
Oh, and you both have
to climax at the same time.

593
00:29:17,417 --> 00:29:18,967
That gonna be a problem?

594
00:29:19,002 --> 00:29:21,336
- No.
- Well…

595
00:29:21,388 --> 00:29:23,671
What?

596
00:29:23,673 --> 00:29:26,140
I'm sorry.

597
00:29:26,176 --> 00:29:28,643
We need the spell to work,
right?

598
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:38,180
I can't believe
I'm letting your boyfriend

599
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,437
talk to my boyfriend
about how to--

600
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,063
ugh.

601
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:44,398
I've never been prouder,

602
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,284
although I must say

603
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:49,954
this one seems like
an awful lot of work.

604
00:29:49,989 --> 00:29:51,739
Who? Quentin?

605
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:53,207
You're complicated.

606
00:29:53,243 --> 00:29:56,043
You need somebody
who gets that about you.

607
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:59,714
Maybe several people.

608
00:29:59,749 --> 00:30:01,109
Don't take this
the wrong way, Mom,

609
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:03,084
but shut the fuck up, okay?

610
00:30:05,088 --> 00:30:07,638
We'll talk
when you're less cranky.

611
00:30:17,767 --> 00:30:20,268
Cheers.

612
00:30:25,358 --> 00:30:26,741
Darling.

613
00:30:26,776 --> 00:30:28,242
Are you okay?

614
00:30:28,278 --> 00:30:29,493
No.

615
00:30:29,529 --> 00:30:30,945
I'm not okay, you dick.

616
00:30:30,997 --> 00:30:33,664
- You stole my life force.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

617
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:36,500
Uh, there was a tiny hole
in the casting.

618
00:30:36,536 --> 00:30:38,619
I've corrected it.
Won't happen again.

619
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:40,421
Shouldn't have happened at all.

620
00:30:40,456 --> 00:30:42,490
I begged you to stay.

621
00:30:42,525 --> 00:30:44,792
Margo, I--I needed you.

622
00:30:44,827 --> 00:30:45,960
You broke my heart.

623
00:30:45,995 --> 00:30:47,261
The only way I could repair it

624
00:30:47,297 --> 00:30:50,998
was to create my golem of you.

625
00:30:51,034 --> 00:30:53,851
A golem of Margo.

626
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:56,470
A Margolem.

627
00:30:56,472 --> 00:30:59,273
You selfish prick.

628
00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:00,808
You put my life at risk

629
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,477
so you could have
a realistic-looking sex doll?

630
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:05,479
No, no, no.
I--

631
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:06,981
I wanted a relationship.

632
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:08,983
Margo…

633
00:31:08,985 --> 00:31:10,618
I love you.

634
00:31:10,653 --> 00:31:12,870
And sometimes the only thing
that we do is spoon and--

635
00:31:14,907 --> 00:31:16,540
You're gross.

636
00:31:16,576 --> 00:31:19,160
I'm taking the Margolem,
and I'm going to destroy it,

637
00:31:19,162 --> 00:31:21,829
and I hope no one ever
spoons you again.

638
00:31:27,887 --> 00:31:28,887
What?

639
00:31:31,174 --> 00:31:32,390
What are you doing?

640
00:31:32,425 --> 00:31:34,558
Nothing.

641
00:31:34,594 --> 00:31:37,511
I brought you to support me
while I fight with my ex,

642
00:31:37,513 --> 00:31:39,063
not do lines with the golem.

643
00:31:39,098 --> 00:31:40,648
Oh, I'm sorry.

644
00:31:40,683 --> 00:31:42,683
I thought this is how
we support each other.

645
00:31:42,685 --> 00:31:45,019
Is there something
you want to say to me, Eliot?

646
00:31:46,356 --> 00:31:47,738
No.

647
00:31:47,774 --> 00:31:49,690
What is there to say?

648
00:31:49,692 --> 00:31:51,859
I like your golem.

649
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:55,696
Life is a unicorn
shitting rainbows of candy.

650
00:31:58,584 --> 00:32:00,368
I'll, um…

651
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:03,754
I'll deal with
the Margolem myself.

652
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,539
Just go home, Eliot.

653
00:32:12,215 --> 00:32:14,181
You have the most
beautiful hair.

654
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,553
And your eyes are, like,

655
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:21,522
the perfect shade of blue.

656
00:32:23,643 --> 00:32:24,608
And you're also smart.

657
00:32:24,644 --> 00:32:26,227
Okay, okay.

658
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:28,529
It kind of feels like you're
trying to do a thing here.

659
00:32:28,564 --> 00:32:30,531
I…

660
00:32:30,566 --> 00:32:34,452
I was told that women like it
when you compliment them.

661
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:37,872
Yeah, but it has
to feel real, you know?

662
00:32:40,326 --> 00:32:42,910
Since when is that an issue?

663
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:44,245
What is that supposed to mean?

664
00:32:44,247 --> 00:32:45,463
Nothing.

665
00:32:48,084 --> 00:32:51,585
Apparently you can't,
you know, with me.

666
00:32:51,637 --> 00:32:53,220
Not that you'd ever
said that to my face.

667
00:32:53,256 --> 00:32:54,755
Yeah, well, maybe you
should pay better attention

668
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:56,057
when we're having sex.

669
00:32:56,092 --> 00:32:57,975
I thought I was.
I don't…

670
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,477
think that I've ever paid
that much attention

671
00:32:59,512 --> 00:33:01,429
to anything in my life,

672
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:03,431
and little did I know that you
were so incredibly convincing.

673
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:05,099
But isn't that what
you want, Quentin, huh?

674
00:33:05,101 --> 00:33:07,268
To feel like you're perfect
at it every time?

675
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:09,103
No, not if I'm not.
I want--

676
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:10,771
How am I supposed to get better

677
00:33:10,823 --> 00:33:13,240
if you won't tell me
if I'm doing it wrong?

678
00:33:18,164 --> 00:33:20,331
So have you, like,

679
00:33:20,366 --> 00:33:22,166
ever come when we're together?

680
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:24,168
Yes.

681
00:33:24,203 --> 00:33:26,921
Lots of times.

682
00:33:26,956 --> 00:33:28,789
I mean it.

683
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:31,175
It's just sometimes…

684
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:34,628
sometimes it's not that easy,

685
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:36,180
you know,
like when we were foxes.

686
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:39,300
Well, I'm sorry I'm not a fox.

687
00:33:44,891 --> 00:33:47,308
Well, there goes the mood.

688
00:34:05,161 --> 00:34:06,877
Voilà.

689
00:34:06,913 --> 00:34:08,963
Reverse entropy.

690
00:34:08,998 --> 00:34:12,383
Spell number 12, done and done.

691
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:14,502
Hard to believe something
so kludgy even works.

692
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:19,056
Perfect timing.
Pizza.

693
00:34:24,931 --> 00:34:27,515
A large half veggie, half meat.

694
00:34:27,517 --> 00:34:29,400
Thank you.

695
00:34:37,443 --> 00:34:38,742
Kady.

696
00:34:38,778 --> 00:34:40,027
Do you see that?

697
00:34:48,421 --> 00:34:51,705
Okay, what just happened?

698
00:34:54,126 --> 00:34:55,509
Déjà vu.

699
00:34:55,545 --> 00:34:56,927
Uh-huh.

700
00:35:04,971 --> 00:35:07,221
A large half veggie, half meat.

701
00:35:10,393 --> 00:35:11,775
Thank you.

702
00:35:14,814 --> 00:35:17,398
Okay, what the fuck is going on?

703
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:18,732
Could it be the entropy spell?

704
00:35:18,734 --> 00:35:20,234
No.

705
00:35:20,236 --> 00:35:23,787
No, this is time magic--
much more power involved.

706
00:35:23,823 --> 00:35:26,240
Well, if we didn't
cast it, who did?

707
00:35:28,578 --> 00:35:29,578
Yeah!

708
00:35:32,276 --> 00:35:33,276
Okay.

709
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:35,808
Sit.
Let's talk.

710
00:35:35,843 --> 00:35:37,309
You've leveled up.

711
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,844
It's time.

712
00:35:38,896 --> 00:35:41,396
No pun intended.

713
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:44,850
Not to state the obvious,

714
00:35:44,902 --> 00:35:46,518
but we are pushing
the boundaries

715
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,237
of what is magically possible.

716
00:35:48,272 --> 00:35:50,689
We are working our way up
to the energetic glass ceiling

717
00:35:50,741 --> 00:35:52,324
so we can shatter it.

718
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:53,659
You say that like it's possible.

719
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:55,527
It is.

720
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:57,496
Well, not according
to Brakebills.

721
00:35:57,531 --> 00:35:59,031
No, the glass ceiling is

722
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:01,667
explode and turn into
a niffin or something.

723
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:02,868
You can't just keep ramping.

724
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,703
Brakebills was right

725
00:36:04,755 --> 00:36:06,755
if you go by
Brakebills' methods.

726
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:09,241
We have a whole new methodology.

727
00:36:09,276 --> 00:36:10,592
Yeah, but why?

728
00:36:10,628 --> 00:36:11,927
I mean, what are you
trying to do?

729
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:13,512
And don't just say
"good things."

730
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:15,097
You're talking about
massive nuclear power.

731
00:36:15,132 --> 00:36:17,933
You're right.
It's personal. Yeah.

732
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:20,686
We are the best Magicians
we know.

733
00:36:20,721 --> 00:36:23,555
Silver can literally
fly to the moon.

734
00:36:23,607 --> 00:36:27,943
But Menolly is dying,
and we can't cure her.

735
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:30,529
You know, Bender's trying
to stay off the ledge every day.

736
00:36:30,564 --> 00:36:33,365
His meds have stopped working.

737
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,367
And you?

738
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:38,036
Eight years ago,
I was a drug addict,

739
00:36:38,072 --> 00:36:41,073
and I left my son

740
00:36:41,075 --> 00:36:43,909
in a hot car.

741
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:47,246
And he was eight months old.

742
00:36:47,248 --> 00:36:50,582
My life was destroyed.

743
00:36:52,136 --> 00:36:53,752
Jesus.

744
00:36:53,754 --> 00:36:55,971
You're doing time magic

745
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:57,556
to change what you did.

746
00:36:57,591 --> 00:37:00,092
Yeah, but only a fluke
natural-born time witch

747
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:01,593
could do something like that.

748
00:37:01,595 --> 00:37:04,229
Now, I have done
all the research there is,

749
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:08,433
and one day, I realized
I was looking at it wrong.

750
00:37:09,486 --> 00:37:11,270
We don't have the energy,

751
00:37:11,322 --> 00:37:13,405
but it's not that
we need to generate it,

752
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,607
because somebody already has it.

753
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:18,243
We just need them,
and they can give us

754
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:20,579
inexhaustible,
unimaginable power.

755
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:24,116
That's no one.

756
00:37:24,168 --> 00:37:26,118
That's the Source.

757
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:28,453
That's the place
it all comes from,

758
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:29,838
how people used to get shit done

759
00:37:29,874 --> 00:37:32,007
when they needed
a fucking miracle.

760
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:34,126
- The divine.
- You're trying to…

761
00:37:36,297 --> 00:37:38,931
Summon a god.

762
00:37:45,522 --> 00:37:46,972
Your fave.

763
00:37:52,813 --> 00:37:54,112
I'm sorry.

764
00:37:57,401 --> 00:37:59,484
Can we really talk, baby?

765
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:07,659
I think Professor Lipson
could have been wrong about me.

766
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:11,496
I think something
might really be broken.

767
00:38:22,843 --> 00:38:24,593
What the fuck?

768
00:38:26,847 --> 00:38:28,513
Oh, Jesus.

769
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:29,815
There she is.

770
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:33,151
She has a bad habit
of walking off,

771
00:38:33,187 --> 00:38:34,853
although when she does,

772
00:38:34,855 --> 00:38:38,023
it's nice to be reminded
I have a great ass.

773
00:38:38,075 --> 00:38:40,859
I thought you were
going to destroy her.

774
00:38:40,861 --> 00:38:42,995
Oh, I was, but then I thought

775
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:45,247
I'd keep her around
a little longer.

776
00:38:45,282 --> 00:38:46,782
She might come in handy.

777
00:38:50,421 --> 00:38:52,838
What were you two talking about?

778
00:38:52,873 --> 00:38:54,206
Nothing.

779
00:38:57,594 --> 00:38:59,594
Got these for you, bitch.

780
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:01,179
Aww.

781
00:39:01,215 --> 00:39:02,681
Thanks, bitch.

782
00:39:04,101 --> 00:39:05,300
We need a chaser.

783
00:39:10,224 --> 00:39:13,275
What did you do?

784
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,227
Hmm?

785
00:39:33,831 --> 00:39:35,664
So I'm a dick.

786
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:39,968
I'm insecure, and I suck,

787
00:39:40,004 --> 00:39:41,753
so if we could just
give this another go,

788
00:39:41,805 --> 00:39:44,589
I'll even--I don't know.

789
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:47,392
I'll be more fox-like
if that's what you want.

790
00:39:47,428 --> 00:39:49,394
I don't want that.

791
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,100
I don't get it, Alice.

792
00:39:54,151 --> 00:39:56,068
I'm not amazing at magic,

793
00:39:56,103 --> 00:39:59,771
and apparently,
I'm pretty patchy at this.

794
00:40:02,443 --> 00:40:05,110
Why are you even with me?

795
00:40:05,162 --> 00:40:07,245
Because I like you.

796
00:40:07,281 --> 00:40:08,447
A lot.

797
00:40:08,499 --> 00:40:09,448
And I don't know why.

798
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,666
I just really, really do

799
00:40:11,702 --> 00:40:14,119
in the weirdest way.

800
00:40:14,171 --> 00:40:16,121
I don't think we're
supposed to like people

801
00:40:16,123 --> 00:40:17,789
for what they're good at.

802
00:40:17,841 --> 00:40:21,293
I think that's something
we make up to torture ourselves.

803
00:40:21,345 --> 00:40:24,429
What about what we're bad at?

804
00:40:24,465 --> 00:40:28,016
You--you're not
bad at sex.

805
00:40:28,052 --> 00:40:31,103
Okay, I'm just bad
at asking for what I want.

806
00:40:31,138 --> 00:40:33,772
It's embarrassing.

807
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:36,108
- It's me, Vix.
- I know.

808
00:40:36,143 --> 00:40:39,361
I know. I know.

809
00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:41,113
And I love you.

810
00:40:42,816 --> 00:40:44,483
And so as far as I'm concerned,

811
00:40:44,535 --> 00:40:47,319
you know, let's just do this.

812
00:40:47,371 --> 00:40:49,988
Oh.

813
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,157
Okay.
Me too.

814
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:53,458
You.

815
00:40:56,046 --> 00:40:58,213
Maybe just kiss me?

816
00:41:30,447 --> 00:41:31,746
No.

817
00:41:31,782 --> 00:41:32,831
There.

818
00:41:46,046 --> 00:41:47,546
Bite me.

819
00:42:01,395 --> 00:42:05,030
Oh, Quentin, you girly
fanboy piece of shit.

820
00:42:05,065 --> 00:42:06,448
You did it.

821
00:42:27,254 --> 00:42:29,054
Whoa.

822
00:42:33,477 --> 00:42:34,559
Welcome back.

3
00:00:04,909 --> 00:00:06,476

4

Regrettably, you failed

Everyone else comes
with a lot of static,

8
00:00:15,386 --> 00:00:17,854
but him, he's clear
as a fucking bell.

9
00:00:17,889 --> 00:00:19,890

Joe?
Oh, I love Joe.

17
00:00:34,169 --> 00:00:36,370
Wait, so you know your way
around the Neitherlands?

18
00:00:36,405 --> 00:00:37,595

00:00:51,086 --> 00:00:52,887
Oh!

26
00:00:52,921 --> 00:00:54,855
I'm a member
of The Order, the keepers

27
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,390
of the libraries of the Neitherlands,

28
00:00:56,425 --> 00:00:57,992
the greatest repository of knowledge.

29
00:00:58,026 --> 00:00:59,560
- Here it is.
- Wait, Martin?

30
00:00:59,594 --> 00:01:00,761
That's--okay, is there

31
00:01:00,796 --> 00:01:02,596
anything in there about The Beast?

32
00:01:07,703 --> 00:01:09,337
Go back to the part
where you literally

33
00:01:09,371 --> 00:01:11,072
popped in on them banging.

34
00:01:11,106 --> 00:01:12,740
We were casting a spell.

35
00:01:12,774 --> 00:01:15,576
- No judgment.
- We saved your life.

36
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,611
All right, so there might
be a solution here.

37
00:01:17,646 --> 00:01:18,946
Uh, a weapon.

38
00:01:18,981 --> 00:01:20,181
It sounds like if we could find it,

39
00:01:20,215 --> 00:01:22,183
we could use it to kill The Beast.

40
00:01:22,217 --> 00:01:25,252
El! Jesus!

41
00:01:25,287 --> 00:01:27,288
It's 11:00 in the morning.

42
00:01:27,322 --> 00:01:28,923
I'm listening.

43
00:01:28,957 --> 00:01:32,193
So Martin's desperate,
'cause the Plover had

44
00:01:32,227 --> 00:01:33,961
figured out a way
to change physically,

45
00:01:33,996 --> 00:01:36,230
which opened up a whole
new class of spellwork,

46
00:01:36,264 --> 00:01:38,399
which meant
that pretty soon he'd be able

47
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:40,034
to follow Martin into Fillory.

48
00:01:40,068 --> 00:01:41,802
Yeah.

49
00:01:41,837 --> 00:01:44,538
So Martin got a line

50
00:01:44,573 --> 00:01:47,241
on an enchanted knife, the Leo.

51
00:01:47,275 --> 00:01:49,076
Uh…

52
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:50,811
Yeah, powerful enough to tear

53
00:01:50,846 --> 00:01:53,647
through the fabric of
magic itself--like, kill a god.

54
00:01:53,682 --> 00:01:58,419
So qualified to murder a fairly
invincible mutant Magician.

55
00:01:58,453 --> 00:02:00,221
That's the same god
that made the Virgo Blade.

56
00:02:00,255 --> 00:02:01,789
I fucking love that guy.

57
00:02:01,823 --> 00:02:03,457
Yeah, so Martin
tracked down the knife maker,

58
00:02:03,492 --> 00:02:04,592
asked him if he could make him one,

59
00:02:04,626 --> 00:02:07,328
and the guy said,

60
00:02:07,362 --> 00:02:09,330
uh…

61
00:02:09,364 --> 00:02:12,066
"Yeah, I can."

62
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,601
And then what?

63
00:02:13,635 --> 00:02:16,103
Uh, well, that's the end
of the pages.

64
00:02:16,138 --> 00:02:17,338
Yeah, nothing happened.

65
00:02:17,372 --> 00:02:18,639
If Martin killed The Beast,

66
00:02:18,673 --> 00:02:20,307
would we be here now
talking about him?

67
00:02:20,342 --> 00:02:22,243
Yeah, but here's the thing.

68
00:02:22,277 --> 00:02:24,812
So little did Martin know

69
00:02:24,846 --> 00:02:27,014
he would fail to recover the blade,

70
00:02:27,049 --> 00:02:28,649
which would remain hidden
for decades,

71
00:02:28,683 --> 00:02:30,523
which means it could still
be sitting somewhere

72
00:02:30,552 --> 00:02:32,119
waiting for us.

73
00:02:32,154 --> 00:02:34,989
Right, in Fillory.

74
00:02:35,023 --> 00:02:37,658
The place where The Beast is.

75
00:02:37,692 --> 00:02:40,628
Ergo, fuck that.

76
00:02:41,696 --> 00:02:44,598
Hey, here's a crazy idea.

77
00:02:44,633 --> 00:02:46,434
Plover wants the button back?

78
00:02:46,468 --> 00:02:48,035
Why don't we just give it to him?

79
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,937
I--I don't think
that's a very good plan.

80
00:02:49,971 --> 00:02:51,772
No, that's
a monumentally shitty plan.

81
00:02:51,807 --> 00:02:53,307
I don't know.

82
00:02:53,341 --> 00:02:55,342
Those Neitherland thugs
work for The Beast, right?

83
00:02:55,377 --> 00:02:58,012
So what if we hand them the button,

84
00:02:58,046 --> 00:02:59,513
thereby giving The Beast
what he wants,

85
00:02:59,548 --> 00:03:01,382
thereby rendering ourselves harmless,

86
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:03,284
thereby he leaves us alone?

87
00:03:03,318 --> 00:03:05,119
Right, 'cause handing the key
to the multiverse to a monster

88
00:03:05,153 --> 00:03:06,854
is a really--
that's a good idea, Eliot.

89
00:03:06,888 --> 00:03:09,690
- Beats getting vivisected.
- Yeah, speak for yourself.

90
00:03:09,724 --> 00:03:11,826
If his whole hard-on's
locking down travel to Fillory

91
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,495
so he keeps it all to himself,
I'm still a problem.

92
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:18,365
Look, you can hide literally
anywhere in the universe.

93
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,668
The rest of us do not
have that luxury.

94
00:03:20,702 --> 00:03:23,137
So let's not kick our only
semi-functional idea

95
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:24,572
out of bed.

96
00:03:24,606 --> 00:03:25,973
Okay, stop.

97
00:03:26,007 --> 00:03:28,242
This affects all of us.

98
00:03:28,276 --> 00:03:31,445
So those in favor of striking a deal.

99
00:03:39,588 --> 00:03:41,222
Sorry. It's the right move.

100
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,429
Because you still seem,
I don't know, gloomy about it.

101
00:03:48,463 --> 00:03:50,431
I can't believe you're not.
Penny's been gone for a week.

102
00:03:50,465 --> 00:03:52,600
Which is like an hour
in the Neitherlands, right?

103
00:03:52,634 --> 00:03:55,769
It means nothing.
What if it works?

104
00:03:55,804 --> 00:03:58,405
Then it works. The Beast
leaves us alone, great.

105
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,607
You're just upset 'cause
you may never get

106
00:03:59,641 --> 00:04:01,175
to go to Fillory.

107
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:03,677
No, that would be stupid.

108
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:05,346
- Quentin.
- Why would I want to go?

109
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,747
The child-molesting demon

110
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:07,781
who incidentally wrote
my favorite books

111
00:04:07,816 --> 00:04:09,917
is there waiting to kill us.

112
00:04:13,288 --> 00:04:14,955
Come on. We're late for P.A.

113
00:04:29,444 --> 00:04:31,205
No!

114
00:04:35,477 --> 00:04:38,879
Please, wake up!

115
00:04:38,914 --> 00:04:42,917
Margo, how did this happen?

116
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:46,487
We should have listened to you, Q.

117
00:05:14,516 --> 00:05:16,617
You think you're hiding, don't you?

118
00:05:44,246 --> 00:05:47,281
Sleep tight, Quentin Coldwater.

119
00:05:50,402 --> 00:06:10,910
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny
www.addic7ed.com</font>

120
00:06:18,213 --> 00:06:21,315
No way in hell we're doing
that fucking spell again.

121
00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:24,518
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm just a little shaky.

122
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:25,986
I don't like dying.

123
00:06:26,021 --> 00:06:30,090
- No kidding.
- You are Margo.

124
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,859
You are fabulous.

125
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:35,396
You are under the influence
of a probability spell.

126
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,466
I am fabulous, aren't I?

127
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:40,533
- Yeah.
- What happened to you?

128
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,269
Beast ripped my head off
in the Neitherlands.

129
00:06:43,303 --> 00:06:45,638
So much for negotiating my freedom.

130
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:48,241
All right, well, this was a dead end.

131
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:49,709
Well, I hate to say I told you so,

132
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,244
but--you know what?

133
00:06:51,278 --> 00:06:53,112
Actually, I don't.
I don't.

134
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:54,580
I don't hate that.

135
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,884
This is the last one.

136
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,652
- It's dead.
- Ugh.

137
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:02,037
We're not learning anything new.

138
00:07:02,157 --> 00:07:04,757
In every scenario,
The Beast comes next week.

139
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,426
There was one time
we didn't all die--

140
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:08,661
when we went to Fillory.

141
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:10,263
No. Everything went white.

142
00:07:10,297 --> 00:07:12,331
It's not necessarily better.

143
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:13,766
Well, I agree with Quentin.

144
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,601
Oh, that's because he blows you.

145
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:17,436
Seriously, eight tries.

146
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:19,572
We get seven deaths, one mysterious?

147
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,807
I--give me that.

148
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:23,609
I don't think that we have a choice.

149
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:25,444
No, I'm choosing to get the fuck

150
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:26,612
away from all of you.

151
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,824
<i>Hello, old friend.</i>

152
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:40,960
<i>Been a while.</i>

153
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:42,662
<i>Do say you missed me a little.</i>

154
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,598
Fuck you.

155
00:07:45,632 --> 00:07:48,434
<i>Let me cut to the chase.</i>

156
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,503
<i>You will deliver yourself to me.</i>

157
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:53,272
<i>Do it now, or do it
when you've gone so mad</i>

158
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:55,107
<i>you have nothing left,</i>

159
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:58,811
<i>because I'm going to make it
very, very loud.</i>

160
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:05,051
Here's the deal: people used
to petition gods all the time

161
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:07,486
to bestow power to work stuff

162
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:08,788
that we'd never dream of.

163
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:12,191
Now, they're it--biggest source
there is.

164
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:16,128
At least they were, question being…

165
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,697
Where the hell are they now?

166
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:18,898
Exactly.

167
00:08:18,932 --> 00:08:20,199
No one's spoken
to a god in centuries.

168
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:22,802
They disappeared.

169
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,137
Um, I believe that we can find a way

170
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,340
to contact them again
to get the kind of help

171
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:28,841
they used to give.

172
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:33,012
- It's time, Richard.
- Contact how?

173
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,081
Humans aren't their only children;

174
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:37,216
there are others

175
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:40,753
who are older and might know more.

176
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:42,221
Magical creatures.

177
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,326
You mean like vampires and unicorns?

178
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,829
Uh, I think unicorns are a myth.

179
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,330
But yes.

180
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:53,599
Find something high up enough
in the hierarchy,

181
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:55,735
they might actually remember
when gods and humans

182
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,169
were on speaking terms.

183
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:58,938
And there's
a huge cross-section of them

184
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:00,339
right here in the city.

185
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:01,907
Yeah, because they want to use us.

186
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:03,042
Look, you're right.

187
00:09:03,076 --> 00:09:04,343
Most of them know nothing other

188
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:06,445
than hunger, thirst, and how to hide,

189
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,748
but it's a food chain, all right?

190
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:10,249
We start at the bottom;
we work our way up

191
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:14,353
till we find someone
who can help us get to them.

192
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,055
How long have you been at this?

193
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:18,224
A while.

194
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:19,725
I won't lie.

195
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,461
You know, it's been tough going.

196
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:24,268
Bender, show them.

197
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,268
Mostly bloodsuckers, useless junkies,

198
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:32,238
but sometimes you can get
a lead on to something else.

199
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:35,063
After they talk your ear off
for, like, 12 hours.

200
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:39,478
Those leads admittedly
keep petering out,

201
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:43,482
but I think we have an ace
up our sleeve now.

202
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,887
- Julia.
- What?

203
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,922
That prayer I gave you, you know,

204
00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:52,258
doesn't work for everyone.

205
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:54,093
Actually, you're the first.

206
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:55,594
I don't understand.

207
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,163
I know you're not
gonna like to hear this,

208
00:09:57,197 --> 00:10:00,166
but I gave you a test.

209
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,402
Why? I'm not religious.

210
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:05,905
I'm not a--I'm not anything.

211
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:09,475
We don't know
why some people are god-touched.

212
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:11,410
All right? There's
no rhyme or reason.

213
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:14,447
Karma, DNA, luck of the draw.

214
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:17,349
But it's you, Julia.

215
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:20,319
I think if we send you on the hunt,

216
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,088
we're gonna get some results.

217
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:30,362
I don't know.
Penny was pretty clear.

218
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:33,332
- What are we planning?
- Nothing yet.

219
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:35,367
Just discussing
how we're all probably gonna die

220
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:37,103
before we even set foot in Fillory

221
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,939
because the Neitherlands
are full of mercenaries.

222
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,474
Sounds like a problem.

223
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:43,476
Point is, we need
some serious battle magic.

224
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,678
But that stuff's illegal.

225
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:48,781
I'm fucking with you.
I'm in.

226
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,282
I'm in too.

227
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,284
I heard the word "illegal."

228
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:55,121
Oh, Alice, there's a note
for you from admin.

229
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,723
I see you've got a call.

230
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:02,128
Mom, please, just calm down.

231
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,696
I can't understand you.

232
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:08,200
You what?

233
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:11,337
I'm so sorry.

234
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:12,738
I have to go.

235
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:14,507
I'll call you as soon as I can.

236
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:20,513
It's Joe.

237
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:23,249
He killed himself.

238
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:25,918
- What?
- I have to talk to Penny.

239
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:34,660
My mom says he was hearing voices

240
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,763
and always getting worse

241
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:41,700
and that the voices
were threatening him.

242
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:44,770
He's a traveler--he was
a traveler--and I just thought--

243
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:48,407
I know what happened to her friend.

244
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:52,545
It's The Beast.

245
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:54,380
Shit.

246
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:56,081
Yeah, I got it under control.

247
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:58,017
Penny, maybe you should think
about the possibility

248
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,785
that he's targeting you guys.

249
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,187
I mean, you're like a walking button.

250
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,822
Think you're telling me anything new?

251
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:10,095
Sorry, I--I should go.

252
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,598
Penny, where are you gonna go?

253
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:14,200
We can find a way to help you.

254
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,968
I'm sorry.
I got to talk to someone.

255
00:12:23,777 --> 00:12:27,613
<i>Stanley, man, you there?</i>

256
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:30,649
Penny. I was wondering
when you were gonna show up.

257
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:32,885
You been hearing him too?

258
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,888
He knows everything there is
about me--

259
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,923
my son's home address,

260
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,459
describes my granddaughter's
every freckle.

261
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:42,061
Look, man, he's targeting us

262
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:45,097
because we can hear him,
because we can travel.

263
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,732
I mean, he wants all the roads

264
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,634
in and out of his fortress on lock.

265
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:50,069
No shit.

266
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:54,440
Like I want to travel
to a blue state,

267
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:57,176
never mind other worlds.

268
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,844
What do we do?

269
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,613
I got a plan,

270
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:02,781
and there's nothing
he can do to stop me.

271
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:05,084
Yeah? Well, what's the plan?

272
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:09,488
Watch…and trust me.

273
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:12,157
This removes all his leverage.

274
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:16,428
He can't make me do a damn thing.

275
00:13:21,744 --> 00:13:23,770
Uh, where did you get this?

276
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:25,435
Is this, like, from World War II?

277
00:13:25,469 --> 00:13:27,103
I tripped and fell on it
locked in a drawer

278
00:13:27,138 --> 00:13:28,271
in Sunderland's office.

279
00:13:28,306 --> 00:13:29,839
My Japanese is a little rusty,

280
00:13:29,874 --> 00:13:33,209
but I think that this says,
"Majikku misairu."

281
00:13:34,645 --> 00:13:35,979
"Magic missile"?

282
00:13:37,148 --> 00:13:38,415
That's, like,

283
00:13:38,449 --> 00:13:40,016
straight-up
"Dungeons & Dragons."

284
00:13:40,051 --> 00:13:42,218
Oh, okay.

285
00:13:42,253 --> 00:13:44,020
Uh…

286
00:13:44,055 --> 00:13:45,622
Do you want to--okay.

287
00:13:45,656 --> 00:13:46,990
Move.

288
00:14:01,272 --> 00:14:03,440
Your Popper 43 is off.

289
00:14:10,982 --> 00:14:12,616
Huh?

290
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,150
What if we got guns?

291
00:14:14,185 --> 00:14:15,585
What? No.

292
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,754
No, look,
this is basic prime directive.

293
00:14:17,788 --> 00:14:21,558
Fillory is a pristine,
non-industrialized society.

294
00:14:21,592 --> 00:14:23,994
- You can't--
- Oh, yes, very pristine.

295
00:14:24,028 --> 00:14:26,429
It's been taken over
by a kiddie-diddling mutant.

296
00:14:26,464 --> 00:14:28,798
Yeah, and that's not Fillory's fault.

297
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,567
Great. Let's go native.

298
00:14:30,601 --> 00:14:34,137
Scale of one to ten, how are you
with a broadsword, Quentin?

299
00:14:34,171 --> 00:14:35,338
This should have worked.

300
00:14:35,373 --> 00:14:37,107
Coulda, shoulda, woulda.

301
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:39,309
I mean, we've all done
battle magic before, right?

302
00:14:39,343 --> 00:14:42,479
One time or another.
Eliot, you--

303
00:14:42,513 --> 00:14:44,648
Twisted Mike's neck
like a doll? Yeah.

304
00:14:44,682 --> 00:14:46,016
And it was shockingly easy.

305
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,584
I don't have an explainer for you.

306
00:14:47,618 --> 00:14:50,086
Yeah, and it just
sort of came puking out.

307
00:14:50,121 --> 00:14:53,356
Well, where'd you learn it?

308
00:14:53,391 --> 00:14:54,724
I know who we need to talk to.

309
00:14:57,294 --> 00:14:59,596
<i>Tonight, or I kill the girl</i>

310
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,964
<i>in the dungeon.</i>

311
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:06,870
Quentin.

312
00:15:08,472 --> 00:15:11,508
No. Whatever it is, just no.

313
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:14,844
Look, we need your help.

314
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:17,313
We're trying to locate your ex.

315
00:15:24,155 --> 00:15:26,289
Penny, please.

316
00:15:26,323 --> 00:15:28,425
I know, but this is really
that important.

317
00:15:33,564 --> 00:15:35,204
It feels jacked to be
doing a mirror spell

318
00:15:35,232 --> 00:15:36,566
in here, seriously.

319
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,135
- Just focus.
- It's not working!

320
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,470
Because she's a good magician,

321
00:15:40,504 --> 00:15:42,539
and she doesn't want to be found.

322
00:15:42,573 --> 00:15:44,641
Look, Penny, I know you don't
really want to find her, but--

323
00:15:44,675 --> 00:15:46,042
The reflection's changing.

324
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:06,996
- You're welcome.
- Penny.

325
00:16:07,031 --> 00:16:08,264
Come with us.

326
00:16:10,534 --> 00:16:12,202
I know this place.

327
00:16:14,572 --> 00:16:16,639
That's Julia's apartment.

328
00:16:19,043 --> 00:16:20,376
Shit.

329
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,546
Okay.

330
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,255
Uh, hi.
Could we come in?

331
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,525
Um, Julia's not here.

332
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:37,260
She won't be back for a couple hours.

333
00:16:37,294 --> 00:16:39,596
Yeah, we're here
to talk to you, actually.

334
00:16:41,265 --> 00:16:42,599
Okay. Um…

335
00:16:44,135 --> 00:16:47,937
<i>Please, please,
give him what he wants!</i>

336
00:17:00,017 --> 00:17:03,887
I think that's
an insanely stupid idea.

337
00:17:03,921 --> 00:17:07,390
You don't just go fight
someone stronger on his turf.

338
00:17:07,424 --> 00:17:09,259
We know.
We have a plan for The Beast.

339
00:17:09,293 --> 00:17:11,161
We just need to make sure
we have enough under our belt

340
00:17:11,195 --> 00:17:12,929
to even make it to him.

341
00:17:12,963 --> 00:17:14,998
Let's just say you're very likely

342
00:17:15,032 --> 00:17:16,933
to be mugged in the Neitherlands.

343
00:17:16,967 --> 00:17:20,170
Look, I'm sorry.
I can't teach it to you.

344
00:17:20,204 --> 00:17:22,172
Look, most people
can't do battle magic

345
00:17:22,206 --> 00:17:25,341
except in crazy spurts.

346
00:17:25,376 --> 00:17:27,777
Like baby-trapped-under-a-car
type shit.

347
00:17:27,812 --> 00:17:29,479
But you can do it on cue.

348
00:17:29,513 --> 00:17:30,993
Yeah, 'cause I studied it for years.

349
00:17:32,483 --> 00:17:33,683
Give us the CliffsNotes.

350
00:17:33,717 --> 00:17:35,084
Fine.

351
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:37,520
Meditate every day
for, like, a decade.

352
00:17:37,555 --> 00:17:40,456
And spells only work
if you channel 100% clean.

353
00:17:40,491 --> 00:17:41,958
Great.

354
00:17:41,992 --> 00:17:43,693
So we're stuck with
our dicks in our hands.

355
00:17:45,496 --> 00:17:51,301
Look, there is this thing hedges use.

356
00:17:51,335 --> 00:17:52,969
But I really wouldn't recommend it.

357
00:17:54,672 --> 00:17:56,272
Okay.

358
00:17:56,307 --> 00:17:57,640
Now we're listening.

359
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,715
<i>She bleeds so easily,
poor little thing.</i>

360
00:18:05,749 --> 00:18:07,550
Fuck!

361
00:18:07,585 --> 00:18:09,819
<i>I barely touched her.</i>

362
00:18:19,663 --> 00:18:20,997
Hey.

363
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:27,503
Look, um…

364
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,675
So…

365
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:36,346
How is she?
Julia, I mean.

366
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:38,381
Why do you care after
what she did to you?

367
00:18:41,552 --> 00:18:43,086
Okay.
It's none of your business.

368
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,154
You know, that's not how it works.

369
00:18:45,189 --> 00:18:47,056
Giving a shit about someone
that you give a shit about

370
00:18:47,091 --> 00:18:49,131
doesn't just evaporate
the second that they fuck up.

371
00:18:51,962 --> 00:18:54,597
So why don't you just admit that
you want to ask me about Penny?

372
00:18:58,535 --> 00:19:00,103
Okay, fine.

373
00:19:00,137 --> 00:19:02,772
Look, Julia is good.

374
00:19:02,806 --> 00:19:04,674
Great, actually.

375
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,609
Like, we're working on something
that could help a lot of people,

376
00:19:06,644 --> 00:19:07,810
so it's good.

377
00:19:08,913 --> 00:19:14,951
Okay, now you--is he okay?

378
00:19:14,985 --> 00:19:18,021
Yeah, he's extra broody, but…

379
00:19:18,055 --> 00:19:19,355
you know, it's Penny;

380
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,391
he's fireproof.

381
00:19:21,425 --> 00:19:23,760
He's like cockroaches; he'll
survive the nuclear winter.

382
00:19:42,813 --> 00:19:45,148
<i>You can end it.</i>

383
00:19:45,182 --> 00:19:47,617
<i>Just end it.</i>

384
00:19:47,651 --> 00:19:49,118
Shut up.

385
00:19:49,153 --> 00:19:52,588
Shut the hell up.

386
00:19:52,623 --> 00:19:54,223
Okay.

387
00:19:54,258 --> 00:19:55,992
Okay, look.

388
00:19:57,671 --> 00:20:00,101
Please help me.

389
00:20:15,161 --> 00:20:17,095
You should thank Alice Quinn.

390
00:20:17,372 --> 00:20:18,931
She found you.

391
00:20:18,998 --> 00:20:23,402
- Get on with the lecture.
- Oh, I've overdosed once.

392
00:20:23,469 --> 00:20:25,003
No, twice, if you count the time

393
00:20:25,071 --> 00:20:28,740
I took so much Prozac,
I developed tardive dyskinesia,

394
00:20:28,808 --> 00:20:31,410
but that was an accident.

395
00:20:31,477 --> 00:20:35,747
The crack--that was
a straight OD, no chaser.

396
00:20:35,815 --> 00:20:37,950
You smoked crack?

397
00:20:38,017 --> 00:20:41,420
I've done things that would
make you hide under a blankie.

398
00:20:41,487 --> 00:20:44,823
So just tell me what's happening.

399
00:20:44,891 --> 00:20:47,793
A voice from another world
has a thing for travelers.

400
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,428
So it's an assault.

401
00:20:49,495 --> 00:20:51,663
That's a nice mild term for it.

402
00:20:56,436 --> 00:21:01,940
This goes on the base of your neck.

403
00:21:02,008 --> 00:21:06,178
It blocks the flow
to your head like a dam.

404
00:21:06,245 --> 00:21:08,180
You didn't think
of giving this to me sooner?

405
00:21:08,247 --> 00:21:10,949
It's not approved.

406
00:21:11,017 --> 00:21:14,786
It wears down the mind's
own ability to defend itself.

407
00:21:14,854 --> 00:21:16,221
It's just a temporary fix

408
00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:18,457
until we can put you
on a stricter regimen.

409
00:21:18,524 --> 00:21:20,325
I don't have time for this.

410
00:21:20,393 --> 00:21:26,098
Penny, you will never have a home.

411
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,469
You will never have a real family.

412
00:21:30,536 --> 00:21:35,874
Your gifts will take this
from you over and over.

413
00:21:35,942 --> 00:21:40,879
So when someone cares enough
to reach out a hand,

414
00:21:40,947 --> 00:21:43,915
just drop the bullshit attitude

415
00:21:43,983 --> 00:21:46,118
and take what they're offering
while you can.

416
00:21:48,654 --> 00:21:52,090
Bottling our emotions, literally.

417
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,161
Kady says we shouldn't use these

418
00:21:56,229 --> 00:21:57,496
for more than three hours
at a time, right?

419
00:21:57,563 --> 00:22:00,032
That it's too hard on the system,

420
00:22:00,099 --> 00:22:02,434
and when the feelings come back,
it's extremely intense.

421
00:22:02,502 --> 00:22:03,869
Yeah, yeah.

422
00:22:03,936 --> 00:22:05,771
Don't lean on the bottle.

423
00:22:05,838 --> 00:22:08,373
But meanwhile we get to go
full Spock with battle magic.

424
00:22:08,441 --> 00:22:11,343
- I don't like it.
- Um, it's the perfect cheat.

425
00:22:11,411 --> 00:22:12,411
I didn't say I wasn't gonna do it;

426
00:22:12,478 --> 00:22:13,779
I said I didn't like it.

427
00:22:17,717 --> 00:22:19,451
Wow, you look--

428
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:21,253
Damn handsome for someone
who just had a heart attack?

429
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,989
What can I say?
Genetically blessed.

430
00:22:26,092 --> 00:22:28,260
- What are those?
- What do you care?

431
00:22:28,327 --> 00:22:30,295
I thought you wanted
nothing to do with us.

432
00:22:30,363 --> 00:22:32,964
I changed my mind.

433
00:22:33,032 --> 00:22:36,268
I'll go to Fillory on one condition.

434
00:22:36,335 --> 00:22:40,439
That girl you saw in the dungeon?

435
00:22:40,506 --> 00:22:41,640
Yeah, we'll get her out.

436
00:22:43,543 --> 00:22:44,910
Deal.

437
00:22:47,947 --> 00:22:49,981
Well, this somehow
doesn't feel like a place

438
00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:52,617
where anyone knows anything.

439
00:22:52,685 --> 00:22:55,487
Well, apparently
this guy's old as dirt.

440
00:22:56,689 --> 00:22:58,023
Got to start somewhere.

441
00:22:58,691 --> 00:22:59,891
Who knows.

442
00:23:05,198 --> 00:23:07,732
<i>♪ 'Cause you can't hold back
what you can't attract ♪</i>

443
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,968
<i>♪ The subtle attention
of time ♪</i>

444
00:23:10,036 --> 00:23:12,304
<i>♪ If you see her,
just let me know ♪</i>

445
00:23:12,371 --> 00:23:14,840
<i>♪ I plan to make
this woman mine ♪</i>

446
00:23:14,907 --> 00:23:16,208
Girls.

447
00:23:17,677 --> 00:23:19,478
Agency sent you?

448
00:23:19,545 --> 00:23:22,647
- You Bjorn?
- I asked for blondes.

449
00:23:22,715 --> 00:23:25,817
I heard about you from a girl
who got fired from a blood bank

450
00:23:25,885 --> 00:23:28,186
on 67th about a year ago.

451
00:23:28,254 --> 00:23:30,589
Apparently, she wasn't
stealing for herself.

452
00:23:30,656 --> 00:23:32,924
Tracy sold me out?

453
00:23:32,992 --> 00:23:34,292
What'd you give her?

454
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,294
Honestly, 20 bucks.

455
00:23:36,362 --> 00:23:38,830
So I don't think that was true love.

456
00:23:38,898 --> 00:23:42,801
- What do you want? I'm busy.
- We just have a few questions.

457
00:23:42,869 --> 00:23:45,871
- Mm.
- We'll pay.

458
00:23:45,938 --> 00:23:48,440
20 whole dollars, rich bitch?

459
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:58,650
Whose is it?

460
00:23:58,718 --> 00:24:00,919
Mine, so it's
the cleanest thing in this room.

461
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:05,557
We want to petition a god.

462
00:24:07,727 --> 00:24:10,529
Um, a--a god?

463
00:24:10,596 --> 00:24:14,366
You mean--you mean like "a god"?

464
00:24:14,433 --> 00:24:17,335
Nobody's doing that stuff
anymore, sweetheart.

465
00:24:17,403 --> 00:24:19,371
God's inside you.

466
00:24:19,438 --> 00:24:22,207
- Come on, I told you--
- Hey, asked and answered.

467
00:24:22,275 --> 00:24:25,510
- Come on. Give me it.
- Give me a name.

468
00:24:25,578 --> 00:24:27,012
Some other thing like you.

469
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,813
Hey, that's offensive.

470
00:24:28,881 --> 00:24:31,216
I'm a person.
I'm a person.

471
00:24:31,284 --> 00:24:33,051
We're not a club.

472
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:35,187
They're all horrible.

473
00:24:35,254 --> 00:24:37,689
Pixies are dicks,
the lycans are rapists,

474
00:24:37,757 --> 00:24:39,024
and shapeshifters,
they all headed west

475
00:24:39,091 --> 00:24:40,325
back in the '50s.

476
00:24:40,393 --> 00:24:42,527
Thank you for that color commentary.

477
00:24:42,595 --> 00:24:44,162
Do you want this or not?
Give me a name.

478
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,364
Okay, okay. Okay.

479
00:24:46,432 --> 00:24:47,599
I got one.

480
00:25:11,591 --> 00:25:14,893
Huh. Sort of pretty.

481
00:25:14,961 --> 00:25:16,761
This must be what undergoing
the Vulcan ritual

482
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:18,930
of Kolinahr is like.

483
00:25:18,998 --> 00:25:21,099
I like your sweater.

484
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:23,401
Are you saying that to be cruel?

485
00:25:23,469 --> 00:25:26,705
No. I like your sweater.

486
00:25:26,772 --> 00:25:28,106
I saw no reason not to share.

487
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:32,277
Well, then.

488
00:25:32,345 --> 00:25:34,613
Shall we go fuck some shit up?

489
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,047
- Yes.
- Yes.

490
00:25:36,115 --> 00:25:37,582
Yes, definitely.
Definitely.

491
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,320
Just remember, if this is a Lamia,

492
00:25:42,388 --> 00:25:45,223
we're dealing
with a high-level psychic.

493
00:25:45,291 --> 00:25:46,591
Yeah.

494
00:26:12,084 --> 00:26:13,818
What are you saying to me?

495
00:26:13,886 --> 00:26:16,254
I'm not saying anything to you.

496
00:26:16,322 --> 00:26:18,823
Who do you think you are?
I just want a quarter.

497
00:26:20,493 --> 00:26:22,460
Hey.

498
00:26:22,528 --> 00:26:25,138
- Chickadee.
- Mom?

499
00:26:25,694 --> 00:26:27,862
It's so good to see you.

500
00:26:27,896 --> 00:26:31,332
I'm so, so sorry.

501
00:26:32,218 --> 00:26:36,243
Baby, I missed you so much.

502
00:26:40,175 --> 00:26:42,109
Kady, step back, okay?
It's not your mom.

503
00:26:42,144 --> 00:26:43,644
I'm not an idiot, Julia.

504
00:26:45,247 --> 00:26:47,848
Julia…

505
00:26:47,883 --> 00:26:50,051
I forgive you.

506
00:26:50,085 --> 00:26:54,121
- I know what you are.
- I'm trying to give you a gift.

507
00:26:54,156 --> 00:26:56,991
Both of you.
You need me.

508
00:26:57,025 --> 00:26:58,392
My mom is dead, bitch.

509
00:26:58,427 --> 00:27:00,227
Drop the act.

510
00:27:00,262 --> 00:27:02,463
If you can read my mind, you
know that we both have knives

511
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:05,333
in our pockets
dipped in gold and silver

512
00:27:05,367 --> 00:27:07,868
and coated in shark's blood.

513
00:27:07,903 --> 00:27:10,304
Jesus, that's overkill.

514
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:13,574
We weren't sure
which legends were true.

515
00:27:13,608 --> 00:27:15,843
I hate Ivy League girls.

516
00:27:15,877 --> 00:27:17,578
Then tell us what we want to hear,

517
00:27:17,612 --> 00:27:19,980
and I'll get that one
out of your hair.

518
00:27:20,015 --> 00:27:21,716
What?

519
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,518
What do I have for you?

520
00:27:24,553 --> 00:27:29,724
Uh, look at this place.
Look at me.

521
00:27:29,758 --> 00:27:32,526
Lamiae were servants of a goddess.

522
00:27:32,561 --> 00:27:34,929
Back before the birth of fire, maybe.

523
00:27:34,963 --> 00:27:36,564
We want to petition her.

524
00:27:40,302 --> 00:27:44,505
Oh. That's so cute.

525
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:46,107
But that's not what you want.

526
00:27:47,943 --> 00:27:51,379
I know what you really
want--

527
00:27:51,413 --> 00:27:55,449
to be whole…

528
00:27:55,484 --> 00:27:58,352
like you were on that day

529
00:27:58,387 --> 00:28:00,454
that you split into two Julias

530
00:28:00,489 --> 00:28:03,924
and you got in that elevator
and lost everything.

531
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:05,426
Shut up.

532
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,895
- I can give you that.
- Get out of my head.

533
00:28:08,997 --> 00:28:10,297
Fine.

534
00:28:10,332 --> 00:28:11,732
I'll be blunt.

535
00:28:11,767 --> 00:28:14,268
She's dead.

536
00:28:14,302 --> 00:28:17,438
They're all dead.

537
00:28:17,472 --> 00:28:21,242
Call the gods all you want.

538
00:28:21,276 --> 00:28:24,378
There's no one to hear you.

539
00:28:24,413 --> 00:28:27,248
Let's go.
Come on.

540
00:28:29,251 --> 00:28:31,152
Anyway, "God is dead"

541
00:28:31,186 --> 00:28:33,053
seems to be the consensus.

542
00:28:33,088 --> 00:28:34,321
I don't accept that.

543
00:28:34,356 --> 00:28:35,923
Well, Lamia seemed pretty convinced.

544
00:28:35,957 --> 00:28:38,559
She was a bitter, half-starved
monster living in filth.

545
00:28:38,593 --> 00:28:40,227
The gods have abandoned her.

546
00:28:40,262 --> 00:28:42,329
It doesn't mean they're gone.

547
00:28:42,364 --> 00:28:45,466
We got another rock to turn over?

548
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,102
Not yet.

549
00:28:48,136 --> 00:28:51,906
- So then what?
- I don't know, Julia.

550
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,475
I mean, what do you want me
to say? "I give up"?

551
00:28:54,509 --> 00:28:56,343
"Forget about ever
really fixing anything"?

552
00:28:56,378 --> 00:28:58,145
No, we keep trying, okay?

553
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,648
At least I do.
You do whatever you want.

554
00:29:00,682 --> 00:29:03,517
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

555
00:29:03,552 --> 00:29:05,186
I mean, this is my house.

556
00:29:13,962 --> 00:29:16,263
You're bleeding a little.

557
00:29:16,298 --> 00:29:17,798
That explains the burning pain.

558
00:29:19,401 --> 00:29:20,935
Is that a traveler thing?

559
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:23,437
It's a hearing voices thing.

560
00:29:23,472 --> 00:29:26,006
Well, I guess that beats
whatever you were snorting.

561
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:27,374
Marginally.

562
00:30:06,748 --> 00:30:08,883
That was an unadulterated success.

563
00:30:08,917 --> 00:30:10,351
Pity we have to put them back.

564
00:30:10,385 --> 00:30:13,220
Agreed.
Feelings are bullshit.

565
00:30:13,255 --> 00:30:15,723
Let's just get this over with.

566
00:30:15,757 --> 00:30:18,292
Right.
Bottoms up.

567
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,901
Whoa.

568
00:30:34,042 --> 00:30:35,609
Quentin.
Quentin.

569
00:30:35,644 --> 00:30:36,944
You know I love you.

570
00:30:36,978 --> 00:30:38,712
I love you so much.
Like, so much.

571
00:30:38,747 --> 00:30:40,681
You know that, right?

572
00:30:40,715 --> 00:30:43,384
Yeah, do you know--'cause
I feel like, uh, I'm kind of,

573
00:30:43,418 --> 00:30:45,553
like, all alone.

574
00:30:45,587 --> 00:30:47,888
Why aren't we friends anymore, El?

575
00:30:47,923 --> 00:30:49,957
We're best friends.

576
00:30:49,991 --> 00:30:54,595
Can we be honest
for five seconds, please?

577
00:30:54,629 --> 00:30:57,131
Honestly…

578
00:30:57,165 --> 00:30:58,799
I'd rather not.

579
00:31:02,671 --> 00:31:03,938
You don't care about me.

580
00:31:06,007 --> 00:31:07,308
That is stupid.

581
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:12,246
We are going to Fillory
to save everything.

582
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,615
It'll all be fine, like before,

583
00:31:14,649 --> 00:31:16,317
except even better.

584
00:31:16,351 --> 00:31:17,685
Now catch up.

585
00:31:18,954 --> 00:31:22,089
This is Daddy's third drink, Bambi.

586
00:31:27,961 --> 00:31:29,673
Jesus.

587
00:31:30,876 --> 00:31:31,910
Oh my head.

588
00:31:32,077 --> 00:31:33,611
I couldn't even sleep.

589
00:31:34,246 --> 00:31:35,747
They were a bad idea, the bottles.

590
00:31:35,814 --> 00:31:36,814
I hate everything.

591
00:31:36,882 --> 00:31:37,916
I hate air right now.

592
00:31:37,983 --> 00:31:39,584
You have diagnosed depression.

593
00:31:39,652 --> 00:31:40,885
Shouldn't be bottling you up;
you could--

594
00:31:40,953 --> 00:31:42,120
Kill myself?

595
00:31:43,856 --> 00:31:45,690
I'm sure Plover
would get to me first.

596
00:31:47,927 --> 00:31:49,160
I think we should try mastering it

597
00:31:49,228 --> 00:31:50,562
without the bottles.

598
00:31:50,629 --> 00:31:53,164
I'm sure you probably could.

599
00:31:53,232 --> 00:31:55,133
I'm talking about all of us.

600
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,535
Not all of us are you, Alice.

601
00:31:57,603 --> 00:31:59,003
Okay.

602
00:31:59,071 --> 00:32:00,838
You're hung over.

603
00:32:00,906 --> 00:32:02,941
I don't think you meant that
like it sounded.

604
00:32:03,008 --> 00:32:04,709
I'm sorry. Yes.

605
00:32:04,777 --> 00:32:06,844
I just--I feel like sometimes
you don't hear yourself.

606
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:09,314
All I said was
that I think we should try--

607
00:32:09,381 --> 00:32:12,083
This is what that looks like.

608
00:32:12,151 --> 00:32:16,721
I am trying as hard as I can.

609
00:32:43,248 --> 00:32:45,850
Okay.
Uh…

610
00:32:48,821 --> 00:32:52,824
If you're not dead, I'm listening.

611
00:32:55,995 --> 00:32:59,597
Whatever--I'm here.

612
00:33:03,802 --> 00:33:05,169
I want to do good.

613
00:33:08,641 --> 00:33:09,774
Please.

614
00:33:16,949 --> 00:33:19,150
Hey.

615
00:33:19,218 --> 00:33:20,818
Troops coming?

616
00:33:20,886 --> 00:33:22,926
Still at the cottage studying.
What are you doing?

617
00:33:22,988 --> 00:33:24,589
Trying to get off the bottle.

618
00:33:24,657 --> 00:33:26,591
Me too. Any luck?

619
00:33:26,659 --> 00:33:28,793
Not yet.

620
00:33:28,861 --> 00:33:30,895
That wine bottle knows
its days are numbered.

621
00:33:43,575 --> 00:33:46,844
Sit. Get Zen.

622
00:33:46,912 --> 00:33:50,081
I don't know if I can.

623
00:33:50,149 --> 00:33:53,651
Every warrior in history
learned how to do it.

624
00:33:53,719 --> 00:33:55,199
I bet plenty of them were hot messes.

625
00:33:58,023 --> 00:33:59,257
We can do this.

626
00:34:05,698 --> 00:34:06,931
<i>Julia.</i>

627
00:35:00,185 --> 00:35:03,755
Not so dead, am I?

628
00:35:03,822 --> 00:35:06,023
Nothing was wasted, Julia.

629
00:35:06,091 --> 00:35:08,059
Ever.

630
00:35:08,127 --> 00:35:11,095
Everything has served
to pull you closer to me.

631
00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:17,201
Find me…

632
00:35:17,269 --> 00:35:19,670
near the bridge.

633
00:35:19,738 --> 00:35:23,775
There's a man who has
served me 1,000 years.

634
00:35:23,842 --> 00:35:26,644
Bring him three gifts.

635
00:35:26,712 --> 00:35:29,814
He'll show you the way.

636
00:35:29,882 --> 00:35:32,884
Then I will come to you,

637
00:35:32,951 --> 00:35:34,652
my beautiful daughter.

638
00:35:38,123 --> 00:35:39,796
Holy shit.

639
00:35:44,807 --> 00:35:47,031
That was a definite wobble, right?

640
00:35:49,431 --> 00:35:50,971
- Hey.
- Hey.

641
00:35:52,474 --> 00:35:54,575
I brought this for you
in case you want it.

642
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,545
Not yet.

643
00:36:07,255 --> 00:36:08,889
You really want to--

644
00:36:13,128 --> 00:36:14,461
Stop.

645
00:36:47,422 --> 00:36:50,464
It's been 3 1/2 hours.

646
00:36:50,498 --> 00:36:52,132
We're late.

647
00:36:52,167 --> 00:36:53,500
It was worth it.

648
00:36:57,873 --> 00:36:59,206
To being bosses.

649
00:37:06,848 --> 00:37:08,148
Ha.

650
00:37:08,183 --> 00:37:10,317
Okay.

651
00:37:17,826 --> 00:37:20,594
Remember that spring

652
00:37:20,629 --> 00:37:24,965
at the foot
of the mountains in Fillory?

653
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,601
It was Chatwin's Torrent.

654
00:37:27,636 --> 00:37:30,304
Thought you didn't
remember the books.

655
00:37:30,338 --> 00:37:31,705
Rupert was wounded, right?

656
00:37:32,841 --> 00:37:35,776
Till the spring healed his leg?

657
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:38,012
Do you think it's real?

658
00:37:38,046 --> 00:37:39,847
Some of the good parts have to be.

659
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:43,851
At least I hope so.

660
00:37:46,221 --> 00:37:47,955
Why?

661
00:37:47,989 --> 00:37:50,190
Because I probably have liver damage.

662
00:37:54,195 --> 00:37:57,197
On that note, we're out of wine.

663
00:38:00,435 --> 00:38:04,204
On that note,
we're out of wine.

664
00:38:07,742 --> 00:38:09,076
Fine, I'll go.

665
00:38:18,586 --> 00:38:21,722
Jesus, you two.

666
00:38:34,636 --> 00:38:36,036
- Ahh!
- I'm sorry.

667
00:38:36,071 --> 00:38:37,404
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

668
00:38:37,439 --> 00:38:41,675
Um, thanks for
reminding me it's there.

669
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:45,713
Uh, okay, it's your turn.

670
00:38:45,747 --> 00:38:46,981
You can do it.

671
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,457
We are going to Fillory.

672
00:39:01,296 --> 00:39:03,097
Oh, my God.

673
00:39:03,131 --> 00:39:07,201
You're Toto, and you are Dorothy.

674
00:39:07,235 --> 00:39:08,268
Yeah.

675
00:39:08,303 --> 00:39:11,972
And I'm flying Muppets.

676
00:39:12,007 --> 00:39:13,707
- One step.
- Meerkats.

677
00:39:13,742 --> 00:39:15,709
- Two step.
- No, wait.

678
00:39:15,744 --> 00:39:16,810
That's not it.

679
00:39:25,653 --> 00:39:26,987
And I think he passed out.

680
00:39:30,525 --> 00:39:32,026
Finally.

681
00:39:36,197 --> 00:39:39,967
You know he was--he was
talking about Chatwin's Torrent.

682
00:39:41,469 --> 00:39:43,837
Let's be honest.

683
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:47,207
There's a lot more wrong
with Eliot than a broken leg.

684
00:39:53,348 --> 00:39:57,284
Yeah, but the spring

685
00:39:57,318 --> 00:40:01,522
didn't just fix Rupert's leg.

686
00:40:01,556 --> 00:40:03,757
It healed him.

687
00:40:03,792 --> 00:40:06,293
All of him.

688
00:40:06,327 --> 00:40:09,930
There's this thing about you, Q.

689
00:40:09,964 --> 00:40:11,965
You actually believe in magic.

690
00:40:13,501 --> 00:40:17,638
- So does everyone.
- No.

691
00:40:17,672 --> 00:40:20,040
We all knows it's real,
but you believe in it.

692
00:40:23,211 --> 00:40:25,546
And you just love it,
pure and simple.

693
00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:35,389
You know, I've never loved
something like that.

694
00:40:39,327 --> 00:40:40,661
That's not true.

695
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,835
Maybe Fillory can fix him.

696
00:40:51,372 --> 00:40:54,174
'Cause he's really not okay,
and he just doesn't care.

697
00:41:02,517 --> 00:41:05,886
It's okay.

698
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,223
We're gonna do whatever we can.

699
00:41:09,257 --> 00:41:11,258
I promise.

<i>Jesus, we could not have screwed up</i>

<i>It appeared when I was

7
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,273
- <i>It came from Jane.</i>
- Who are you?

8
00:00:11,393 --> 00:00:12,809
I'm a member of The Order,

9
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:14,561
the keepers of the libraries
of the Neitherlands.

10
00:00:14,613 --> 00:00:15,979
Any idea who the motherfuckers
in the hoods are,

11
00:00:15,981 --> 00:00:17,147
<i>trying to kill me?</i>

12
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,365
They've been thoroughly cursed,

13
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,150
so they can't use the fountains,

14
00:00:20,202 --> 00:00:21,652
but that hasn't stopped them
from finding other employment.

15
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:23,203
The Beast?

16
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:25,038
We are the best Magicians we know,

17
00:00:25,074 --> 00:00:26,740
but Menolly is dying.

18
00:00:26,792 --> 00:00:28,408
Bender's trying to stay
off the ledge every day.

19
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,493
And you?

20
00:00:29,495 --> 00:00:30,544
Eight years ago,

21
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:31,878
I was a drug addict,

22
00:00:31,914 --> 00:00:36,500
and I left my son in a hot car.

23
00:00:36,552 --> 00:00:37,668
We're not learning anything new.

24
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,002
Beast always kills us.

25
00:00:39,004 --> 00:00:40,837
There was one time
we didn't all die--

26
00:00:40,839 --> 00:00:42,170
when we went to Fillory.

27
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,840
<i>Point is, we need
some serious battle magic.</i>

28
00:00:43,842 --> 00:00:45,676
Bottling our emotions…

29
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:47,511
<i>When the feelings come back,
it's extremely intense.</i>

Bring him three gifts.
He'll show you the way.

Could you get to the point, Quentin?

410
00:19:10,124 --> 00:19:11,790
I have a trustees meeting.

411
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:13,959
You know something about
what's been happening here--

412
00:19:14,011 --> 00:19:16,545
The Beast, Eliza.

413
00:19:16,597 --> 00:19:19,348
I would like to know
what is really going on here.

414
00:19:19,383 --> 00:19:20,966
I know you would,

415
00:19:21,018 --> 00:19:22,801
but we are done.

416
00:19:22,803 --> 00:19:24,970
How did you lose your virginity?

417
00:19:25,022 --> 00:19:27,139
I was 24 years old.

418
00:19:27,141 --> 00:19:28,724
I was too embarrassed to tell anyone.

419
00:19:28,776 --> 00:19:30,643
She was considerably older than I

420
00:19:30,695 --> 00:19:34,146
and, oh, much, much more experienced.

421
00:19:34,148 --> 00:19:36,815
But…

422
00:19:36,817 --> 00:19:39,068
Fuck!

423
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,570
You've managed to dose me,
haven't you?

424
00:19:41,622 --> 00:19:44,823
In my tea.
You little shit.

425
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:48,827
Truth serum is toxic,
Quentin, and banned.

426
00:19:48,879 --> 00:19:50,496
And if you were going
to throw magic at me,

427
00:19:50,548 --> 00:19:52,881
you would have done so already,
but you haven't.

428
00:19:52,917 --> 00:19:55,334
Eliza…

429
00:19:55,336 --> 00:19:56,719
who is she?

430
00:19:56,754 --> 00:20:00,756
Eliza's real name is Jane Chatwin.

431
00:20:00,808 --> 00:20:03,559
Oh…

432
00:20:03,594 --> 00:20:05,594
I was kind of poking around
in the dark with that one.

433
00:20:05,646 --> 00:20:09,181
Uh…

434
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:11,567
Okay, what does Jane
have to do with The Beast?

435
00:20:11,602 --> 00:20:14,520
Do you remember the gift
that Jane was given in the book

436
00:20:14,572 --> 00:20:17,022
"The Girl Who Told Time"?

437
00:20:17,074 --> 00:20:21,193
Uh, yeah, Ember gave her
a watch and a locket.

438
00:20:21,195 --> 00:20:24,113
Ember gave her the ability
to fuck with time

439
00:20:24,165 --> 00:20:25,698
on a cosmic scale,

440
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,450
and Jane used it
to create a time loop.

441
00:20:28,502 --> 00:20:30,953
When she'd fail to stop The Beast,

442
00:20:31,005 --> 00:20:32,538
she'd restart the loop.

443
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,039
A time loop.

444
00:20:34,091 --> 00:20:36,375
Okay.

445
00:20:36,377 --> 00:20:38,377
Uh…

446
00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:41,630
So what do we have to do
with The Beast?

447
00:20:41,682 --> 00:20:43,215
You just keep getting involved.

448
00:20:43,217 --> 00:20:45,050
I don't keep doing anything.

449
00:20:45,102 --> 00:20:46,602
Can you imagine, Quentin,

450
00:20:46,637 --> 00:20:51,440
how many times we've had
this exact conversation?

451
00:20:51,475 --> 00:20:55,060
You've managed to slip
truth serum to me 27 times,

452
00:20:55,062 --> 00:20:57,896
27 ways, and I'm quite sick of it.

453
00:20:57,898 --> 00:20:59,064
So, what, this is just some

454
00:20:59,116 --> 00:21:00,733
giant, blood-soaked
"Groundhog Day"?

455
00:21:00,735 --> 00:21:03,235
You always bring up
that fucking movie.

456
00:21:03,237 --> 00:21:04,953
I still haven't seen it.

457
00:21:04,989 --> 00:21:06,071
[chuckles]

458
00:21:06,073 --> 00:21:07,823
Now it's a point of pride.

459
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,241
Answer my question.

460
00:21:09,243 --> 00:21:10,826
In each loop,

461
00:21:10,878 --> 00:21:14,246
Jane alters something

462
00:21:14,248 --> 00:21:17,132
to see if it'll change the outcome.

463
00:21:17,168 --> 00:21:18,967
The sigil that appeared on your hand,

464
00:21:19,003 --> 00:21:20,636
brought you to Alice--

465
00:21:20,671 --> 00:21:22,755
that was Jane trying
to get the ball rolling,

466
00:21:22,757 --> 00:21:25,424
trying to get you all
together, working fast,

467
00:21:25,426 --> 00:21:27,676
and we all know how well
that particular great idea

468
00:21:27,728 --> 00:21:30,429
worked out, don't we?

469
00:21:30,481 --> 00:21:32,264
So has anything actually helped?

470
00:21:32,266 --> 00:21:35,350
So far, all the loops
end in your death.

471
00:21:35,403 --> 00:21:36,935
How many times have I died?

472
00:21:36,987 --> 00:21:38,437
39.

473
00:21:38,439 --> 00:21:40,439
39 times.

474
00:21:40,441 --> 00:21:42,274
And if you die a 40th,

475
00:21:42,326 --> 00:21:43,692
at least I won't have to hear you

476
00:21:43,744 --> 00:21:46,361
ask me this question ever again.

477
00:21:46,414 --> 00:21:49,281
Jane's dead, Quentin.

478
00:21:49,283 --> 00:21:50,783
The loop's done.

479
00:21:50,785 --> 00:21:54,002
There's no one to reset it.

480
00:21:54,038 --> 00:21:55,838
So this is it?

481
00:21:55,873 --> 00:21:57,506
This isn't my problem.

482
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:59,508
My problem is that I'm strong enough

483
00:21:59,543 --> 00:22:01,627
to discern a time loop

484
00:22:01,629 --> 00:22:03,378
but not strong enough to change it.

485
00:22:03,431 --> 00:22:05,047
We better hope and pray

486
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:07,966
that Jane altered the right
thing this time around.

487
00:22:07,968 --> 00:22:10,135
Anything else, Quentin?

488
00:22:10,187 --> 00:22:12,054
What's different this time?

489
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,610
Please, no books on the floor.

490
00:22:24,485 --> 00:22:26,535
I love this one.

491
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:30,405
Photos from places I can't imagine.

492
00:22:30,458 --> 00:22:33,242
I know you hate it now,

493
00:22:33,294 --> 00:22:36,245
but travelers wrote
our most precious books.

494
00:22:36,297 --> 00:22:39,164
The library is what it is
because of them.

495
00:22:39,216 --> 00:22:42,167
You make it sound so simple and fun.

496
00:22:42,169 --> 00:22:43,919
No.

497
00:22:43,971 --> 00:22:45,671
But it is valuable.

498
00:22:45,673 --> 00:22:47,222
And in my observation,

499
00:22:47,258 --> 00:22:51,009
master travelers have
a fantastic time doing it.

500
00:22:53,264 --> 00:22:55,848
I was looking for any technical info

501
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,734
that would get me anywhere
close to mastery, but--

502
00:22:58,769 --> 00:23:01,403
The books you seek
are in another branch.

503
00:23:01,438 --> 00:23:04,356
Of course they are.

504
00:23:04,408 --> 00:23:07,526
Look, could you--
could you expedite that shit?

505
00:23:07,578 --> 00:23:09,278
I don't have much time,

506
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:12,364
and I really need to know
how to take people with me.

507
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:14,867
I'll put in a request.

508
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:16,952
Why am I not feeling optimistic?

509
00:23:17,004 --> 00:23:18,954
Probably because
Franz Kafka wrote "The Trial"

510
00:23:19,006 --> 00:23:22,424
after spending a week in the library.

511
00:23:22,459 --> 00:23:26,879
But, Penny, if you can
survive long enough,

512
00:23:26,881 --> 00:23:30,132
you will get a handle on it.

513
00:23:30,184 --> 00:23:33,051
I promise.

514
00:23:33,103 --> 00:23:35,137
If?

515
00:23:35,189 --> 00:23:37,890
Say that in my book?

516
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,944
No spoilers.

Hi.

521
00:24:13,047 --> 00:24:14,422
I was at Brakebills.

522
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:15,702
You were supposed to be.

523
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:19,031
Or you were, like, 39 times.

524
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,867
You were the thing they changed.

525
00:24:20,869 --> 00:24:23,035
Jane thought, you know,
cast you out in the cold,

526
00:24:23,037 --> 00:24:25,037
and you would get stronger,
and--

527
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:27,373
So I was right.

00:24:27,425 --> 00:24:29,542
The whole time, I was right.

00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,381
I should have believed you, Jules.

You're taking this a lot
better than I would have.

554
00:25:52,043 --> 00:25:56,295
It's because there is bigger,
better magic in the world.

555
00:25:56,297 --> 00:25:58,965
I mean, you would not believe
some of the shit I've seen.

Look, I can't lie, okay?

592
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:36,228
It was shitty going
for a while there,

593
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,613
not being in Brakebills,

594
00:27:37,648 --> 00:27:40,066
but I can't sit here now

595
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:43,119
and think it was anything but fate.

596
00:27:43,154 --> 00:27:46,739
Right, or just the right
random combination.

597
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:49,158
Okay, suit yourself, nihilist.

598
00:27:53,664 --> 00:27:55,081
I need your help.

599
00:27:55,083 --> 00:27:56,916
I don't know how to get back,

600
00:27:56,918 --> 00:28:00,419
and, um, my friends,
we got separated,

601
00:28:00,421 --> 00:28:02,588
and I just--I can't let them
fight The Beast on their own,

602
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,757
and I have to find
a way, um--

603
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:06,092
Let me get this straight.

604
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:10,596
You want me to come
to Fillory with you.

605
00:28:10,598 --> 00:28:12,598
Uh, yeah.

606
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:18,154
Come here.

607
00:28:18,189 --> 00:28:20,990
Holy shit.
This is our table.

608
00:28:21,025 --> 00:28:23,442
Kind of been planning
this trip since we were nine.

609
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:25,161
We kind of have, huh?

610
00:28:25,196 --> 00:28:27,947
Our Lady gave me
a mission to--

611
00:28:27,949 --> 00:28:30,116
I sound like a nutjob.

612
00:28:30,168 --> 00:28:32,168
- Kind of.
- [chuckles]

613
00:28:32,203 --> 00:28:35,287
What's the mission?

614
00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:38,290
She said it was my destiny

615
00:28:38,342 --> 00:28:41,710
to basically find
a whole new kind of magic.

616
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:43,879
You know, she said it was something

617
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:46,048
that couldn't be given.

618
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,384
It had to be found.

619
00:28:48,436 --> 00:28:52,555
So we have to find it.

620
00:28:52,607 --> 00:28:54,356
And I bet you it's here.

621
00:28:54,392 --> 00:28:57,393
So I guess we're off
to see the Wizard.

622
00:28:57,445 --> 00:29:00,062
Have you given any thought
to how we're gonna get there?

623
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:02,531
Start of the London Blitz, 1940,

624
00:29:02,567 --> 00:29:04,817
and then their mom dies, 1941.

625
00:29:04,819 --> 00:29:06,485
Q, where are you going with this?

626
00:29:06,487 --> 00:29:09,371
Okay, so we can't just
open a door to Fillory,

627
00:29:09,407 --> 00:29:12,041
but we do know
when they open--

628
00:29:12,076 --> 00:29:13,375
every time the Chatwins go.

629
00:29:13,411 --> 00:29:14,994
So if we could just
find a way to get there,

630
00:29:15,046 --> 00:29:17,163
then we could follow 'em in.

631
00:29:17,215 --> 00:29:18,714
Uh…

632
00:29:18,749 --> 00:29:22,668
Look, all I know is time magic
is apparently a thing,

633
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,837
a thing that's been dicking with
us for the past 39 lifetimes.

634
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:27,673
So I say we find a way
to make it work for us.

635
00:29:27,675 --> 00:29:30,559
Wait, but that would put us
in past Fillory, right?

636
00:29:30,595 --> 00:29:32,728
Fillory is magic.

637
00:29:32,763 --> 00:29:35,397
Remember, Jane falls in that swamp,

638
00:29:35,433 --> 00:29:37,183
and then she comes out
20 years later.

639
00:29:37,185 --> 00:29:39,351
She strikes a deal
with the Watcherwoman

640
00:29:39,353 --> 00:29:41,270
to send her back.

641
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:45,741
Once you're there,
there's always a way.

642
00:29:45,776 --> 00:29:47,409
I have an idea,

643
00:29:47,445 --> 00:29:49,028
something Richard told me,

644
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,697
but we have to go
somewhere to get it.

645
00:29:51,699 --> 00:29:53,449
Brakebills.

646
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:54,783
Okay.

647
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:56,535
Uh, you just have to be
a registered student

648
00:29:56,537 --> 00:29:58,871
in order to get through the wards.

649
00:29:58,923 --> 00:30:01,040
Alumni key.

650
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:03,592
Richard gave it to me.

651
00:30:04,795 --> 00:30:06,095
This place is impossible.

652
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:07,880
How does anyone find anything?

653
00:30:07,882 --> 00:30:10,466
There's a whole wing
on cat paintings.

654
00:30:10,518 --> 00:30:13,135
What have you got?
Anything?

655
00:30:13,187 --> 00:30:15,054
"The Book of
Mike McCormick."

656
00:30:15,106 --> 00:30:17,056
Novella, really.

657
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:22,228
He was actually a Republican.
Can you believe it?

658
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:24,063
But the worst part?

659
00:30:24,065 --> 00:30:26,115
His life was happy.

660
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,566
Eliot, he's gone.

661
00:30:27,568 --> 00:30:29,318
Why are you torturing yourself?

662
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:32,738
Because he's gone and it's my fault.

663
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,456
And of all the people in the world

664
00:30:34,492 --> 00:30:37,409
who don't understand,
somehow you top the list.

665
00:30:39,714 --> 00:30:41,914
- What are you doing?
- Putting the past behind me.

666
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:44,250
[gasps] No, stop!

667
00:30:44,252 --> 00:30:45,584
Look, he's had a really bad week.

668
00:30:45,586 --> 00:30:47,169
We'll pay the fine, whatever.

669
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:50,172
Nope, no, you are banished
from the library forever.

670
00:30:50,224 --> 00:30:52,258
It's one book.

671
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,310
No, it's a life.

672
00:30:54,345 --> 00:30:56,095
They're irreplaceable.

673
00:30:57,181 --> 00:30:58,230
No, wait!

674
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:02,935
What did you do?

675
00:31:02,937 --> 00:31:05,938
Let's go.

676
00:31:09,327 --> 00:31:11,610
<i>"Bridge to ancient Rome."</i>

677
00:31:11,612 --> 00:31:15,531
"Bridge to
the Cretaceous period."

678
00:31:15,583 --> 00:31:17,116
Oh, hey, here's one.

679
00:31:17,168 --> 00:31:19,618
"Southampton, England, 1912"?

680
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,121
[laughs]
Voyage of the "Titanic."

681
00:31:22,173 --> 00:31:23,839
Oh, fun.

682
00:31:23,874 --> 00:31:25,474
So we're pretty sure
these things only go

683
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:27,626
to one specific
point in time and--

684
00:31:27,628 --> 00:31:29,461
Once you log a date in,
you're locked.

685
00:31:29,463 --> 00:31:32,631
I mean, they use some tiny piece
of an incredibly rare element.

686
00:31:32,633 --> 00:31:34,883
All got used up by the '70s.

687
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,385
Wait a minute.

688
00:31:36,437 --> 00:31:38,470
Wait.
Here's a thesis.

689
00:31:38,472 --> 00:31:42,141
A bunch of students wanted
to go back and kill Hitler.

690
00:31:42,193 --> 00:31:45,311
"Operation Die Fuehrer."
[scoffs]

691
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:46,478
Guess no one told 'em Hitler was

692
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,980
a pretty serious battle Magician?

693
00:31:48,032 --> 00:31:49,481
Yeah.

694
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:51,567
Uh, yep, and Hitler killed them.

695
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:53,068
Wait, what's the date
on the time bridge?

696
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,822
Uh, it's April 19, 1942.

697
00:31:56,824 --> 00:31:59,491
April 19th.

698
00:31:59,543 --> 00:32:01,327
Yeah.

699
00:32:01,379 --> 00:32:05,247
You remember the, uh--
yeah, "The Flying Forest."

700
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:07,583
Yeah, uh, Jane's going into town.

701
00:32:07,635 --> 00:32:10,419
She's looking for
a present for Martin.

702
00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:14,173
April 21, 1942.

703
00:32:14,225 --> 00:32:16,175
Two days after this time bridge.

704
00:32:16,227 --> 00:32:18,060
Holy shit, Q, this could work.

705
00:32:18,095 --> 00:32:20,346
I never thought I'd say it,
but thank God for Hitler.

706
00:32:20,348 --> 00:32:24,400
Yeah, no, that still sounds bad.

707
00:32:24,435 --> 00:32:25,901
Yeah.

708
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:30,439
Earth fountain's blocked off.

709
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:31,690
I told you it would be.

710
00:32:31,742 --> 00:32:32,908
It was worth a shot.

711
00:32:32,943 --> 00:32:34,610
I mean, what else are we gonna do?

712
00:32:34,662 --> 00:32:36,195
I don't know.
How about not get us kicked out

713
00:32:36,247 --> 00:32:37,746
of the library in the first place?

714
00:32:37,782 --> 00:32:39,915
All right, let's keep moving.

715
00:32:40,355 --> 00:32:42,939
Hey.
Don't walk one more step.

716
00:32:42,941 --> 00:32:44,691
We're highly trained Earth magicians.

717
00:32:44,743 --> 00:32:47,160
Hold up. Hold up.
You guys are from Brakebills?

718
00:32:47,196 --> 00:32:50,113
Dude, Josh Hoberman, class of '16.

719
00:32:50,165 --> 00:32:52,282
Come with me if you want to live.

720
00:32:52,334 --> 00:32:54,284
I've always wanted to say that.

721
00:32:54,336 --> 00:32:55,619
[chuckles]

722
00:32:57,756 --> 00:32:59,840
But seriously, um, we should go.

723
00:32:59,875 --> 00:33:02,926
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

724
00:33:04,151 --> 00:33:06,272
Welcome to ***.

725
00:33:09,099 --> 00:33:11,015
You're welcome to whatever.

726
00:33:11,067 --> 00:33:12,600
Just don't eat the carrots.

727
00:33:12,652 --> 00:33:15,770
They're totally psychedelic
for some reason.

728
00:33:15,822 --> 00:33:18,940
Circumstances in the
Neitherlands are super weird.

729
00:33:18,992 --> 00:33:20,675
Holy shit.

730
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,360
This tastes like pizza.

731
00:33:22,412 --> 00:33:23,862
Yeah, I know, right?

732
00:33:23,914 --> 00:33:25,280
How long have you been down here?

733
00:33:25,332 --> 00:33:26,781
A few weeks.

734
00:33:26,833 --> 00:33:28,199
Just been camped out,

735
00:33:28,251 --> 00:33:29,667
waiting to see if anyone else
will show up.

736
00:33:29,703 --> 00:33:30,785
Anyone else?

737
00:33:30,837 --> 00:33:32,287
From my class.

738
00:33:32,339 --> 00:33:34,122
Look, don't freak,
but back at Brakebills,

739
00:33:34,124 --> 00:33:35,673
nobody knows what happened
to you guys.

740
00:33:35,709 --> 00:33:38,293
And it's sort of been two years.

741
00:33:38,345 --> 00:33:40,795
Oh, shit.
Right, the whole time thing.

742
00:33:40,797 --> 00:33:42,297
Victoria warned me about that.

743
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:46,050
Victoria?
You know her?

744
00:33:46,102 --> 00:33:48,019
She's the only reason I'm alive.

745
00:33:48,054 --> 00:33:49,771
Look are you gonna tell us

746
00:33:49,806 --> 00:33:51,556
what the fuck happened
to your class, or what?

747
00:33:51,608 --> 00:33:52,640
Where'd you guys go?

748
00:33:52,692 --> 00:33:53,892
To Fillory

749
00:33:53,944 --> 00:33:56,694
for spring break.

750
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,396
V's amazing.

751
00:33:58,448 --> 00:34:01,482
I mean, she literally blips
around the universe, fearless.

752
00:34:01,534 --> 00:34:03,985
<i>Teachers put this tattoo
on her to stop her.</i>

753
00:34:04,037 --> 00:34:05,870
She just cut it off herself.

754
00:34:05,906 --> 00:34:07,238
- Joshy.
- What?

755
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:08,539
- You're not gonna believe it.
- What?

756
00:34:08,575 --> 00:34:10,909
I did it.
I found Fillory.

757
00:34:10,961 --> 00:34:12,493
- What?
- I found Fillory!

758
00:34:12,495 --> 00:34:14,045
- Oh, my God!
- Whoo! We're going to Fillory!

759
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,580
- We're going to Fillory?
- [laughs] Uh-huh!

760
00:34:15,632 --> 00:34:17,332
<i>So we decided to plan a trip.</i>

761
00:34:17,334 --> 00:34:19,167
<i>You know, party,
smoke out with the centaurs,</i>

762
00:34:19,169 --> 00:34:21,052
<i>be back in time for classes,</i>

763
00:34:21,087 --> 00:34:23,554
<i>but word got out to practically
the whole first year class,</i>

764
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,340
<i>except for a couple losers.</i>

765
00:34:25,392 --> 00:34:26,841
<i>Luckily, V was so good,</i>

766
00:34:26,843 --> 00:34:28,760
<i>she was able to take them all with.</i>

767

00:00:49,813 --> 00:00:51,196
I can't sit here now

23
00:00:51,231 --> 00:00:53,365
and think it was anything but fate.

24
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,317
<i>We summoned a goddess.</i>

25
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:58,069
<i>She touched all of us.
She granted every petition.</i>

26
00:00:58,121 --> 00:01:00,488
There was one time
we didn't all die…

27
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:01,873
when we went to Fillory.

28
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:03,158
I'll go to Fillory

29
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,492
on one condition.

30
00:01:04,545 --> 00:01:05,827
<i>The girl you saw in the dungeon?</i>

31
00:01:05,829 --> 00:01:07,245
<i>We'll get her out.</i>

32
00:01:07,297 --> 00:01:08,914
<i>We need some serious battle magic.</i>

33
00:01:08,966 --> 00:01:11,216
<i>Spells only work
if you channel 100% clean.</i>

34
00:01:11,251 --> 00:01:13,835
Bottling our emotions literally.

35
00:01:13,887 --> 00:01:16,504
Shall we go fuck some shit up?

36
00:01:16,557 --> 00:01:17,923
You slept with two other people.

37
00:01:17,975 --> 00:01:20,392
<i>We broke up.
I was out of my mind.</i>

38
00:01:20,427 --> 00:01:21,509
<i>I made a mistake.</i>

39
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:23,345
<i>My friends, I just…</i>

40
00:01:23,347 --> 00:01:25,180
<i>I can't let them fight
The Beast on their own.</i>

41
00:01:25,232 --> 00:01:27,515
You want me
to come to Fillory with you?

42
00:01:27,517 --> 00:01:29,184
Yeah.

43
00:01:29,236 --> 00:01:31,686
Kind of been planning
this trip since we were nine.

44
00:01:38,962 --> 00:01:41,913
<i>"Fillory and Further.</i>

45
00:01:41,949 --> 00:01:44,749
<i>Book Seven."</i>

46
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:50,538
<i>I will think of a great title later.</i>

47
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:56,511
_

48
00:01:57,382 --> 00:02:02,125
_

49
00:02:02,853 --> 00:02:06,221
<i>I knew it started as a blob
of crazy magic energy</i>

50
00:02:06,223 --> 00:02:07,722
<i>floating in space that gave birth</i>

51
00:02:07,724 --> 00:02:09,391
<i>to the gods, Ember and Umber,</i>

52
00:02:09,443 --> 00:02:14,729
<i>that gave birth
to this amazing place: Fillory.</i>

53
00:02:14,781 --> 00:02:16,898
<i>And I even knew that
that place was real.</i>

54
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:19,951
<i>What I didn't know was one day,</i>

55
00:02:19,987 --> 00:02:21,453
<i>I would actually go there</i>

56
00:02:21,488 --> 00:02:23,905
<i>and seek out the gods themselves.</i>

57
00:02:23,907 --> 00:02:26,408
Ember?

58
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:30,245
We need to talk to you.

59
00:02:30,297 --> 00:02:33,415
Go on.
Put a little conviction in it.

60
00:02:33,467 --> 00:02:35,634
Ember!

61
00:02:38,505 --> 00:02:42,257
Okay.
Um, how did Martin summon him?

62
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:44,099
I don't know.
The books are all poetry.

63
00:02:44,144 --> 00:02:48,313
It's like, "Martin's blood
sang to the gods."

64
00:02:50,017 --> 00:02:53,485
Em.

65
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,103
Q.

66
00:02:55,155 --> 00:02:57,656
What if it was literal?

67
00:02:57,691 --> 00:03:00,108
That's worth a shot.

68
00:03:04,698 --> 00:03:06,948
Damn it.

69
00:03:11,338 --> 00:03:13,338
You okay?

70
00:03:13,373 --> 00:03:15,623
No, I just stabbed my own hand.

71
00:03:20,931 --> 00:03:22,847
Ah!

72
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:33,641
<i>We were expecting something amazing,</i>

73
00:03:33,643 --> 00:03:35,360
<i>and it… it was amazing.</i>

74
00:03:35,395 --> 00:03:37,979
<i>Just more the shitty kind.</i>

75
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:42,400
Smells like an outhouse in here.

76
00:03:45,122 --> 00:03:48,456
Jeez, look at all this trash.

77
00:03:50,293 --> 00:03:52,660
Someone's been holed up here a while.

78
00:03:52,713 --> 00:03:56,164
It is customary to bow,

79
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:58,883
Children Of Earth.

80
00:04:12,015 --> 00:04:15,066
Have you brought me little cakes?

Holy shit.

<i>to follow Jane Chatwin through</i>

91
00:04:52,222 --> 00:04:55,140
<i>a vaguely TARDIS-looking portal
to Fillory.</i>

92
00:04:55,192 --> 00:04:56,724
Here she comes!

93
00:04:56,726 --> 00:04:58,610
<i>We figured
once we were actually there,</i>

94
00:04:58,645 --> 00:05:01,780
<i>we could get to the present
and back to my friends somehow,</i>

95
00:05:01,815 --> 00:05:03,898
<i>'cause that's Fillory.</i>

96
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,117
<i>There's always a way.</i>

97
00:05:06,153 --> 00:05:08,236
<i>There's Jane, and there's us,</i>

98
00:05:08,238 --> 00:05:11,823
<i>and someone mysterious
watching us, by the way,</i>

99
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:15,293
<i>to follow us through.</i>

100
00:05:15,328 --> 00:05:18,663
<i>Standing in Fillory was
the greatest moment of my life,</i>

101
00:05:18,715 --> 00:05:20,915
<i>and not just because,
as I later found out,</i>

102
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:22,801
<i>the air is .02% opium,</i>

103
00:05:22,836 --> 00:05:25,086
<i>which is a pretty unfair trick
to get you to love a place,</i>

104
00:05:25,088 --> 00:05:27,972
<i>but, whatever, we loved it.</i>

105
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,478
<i>Oh, uh, oh, so…
if you're a real fan,</i>

106
00:05:33,513 --> 00:05:35,346
<i>you totally recognize this
from the books…</i>

107
00:05:35,398 --> 00:05:37,182
<i>this iconic scene, right?</i>

108
00:05:37,234 --> 00:05:40,185
<i>Jane falls into a trap and
is saved by passing Magicians,</i>

109
00:05:40,237 --> 00:05:45,323
<i>but you didn't know is
I am in that scene, bitches.</i>

110
00:05:45,358 --> 00:05:48,443
Struggle, struggle.
Tighter, tighter.

111
00:05:48,495 --> 00:05:50,695
Okay, do you see them yet?

112
00:05:50,747 --> 00:05:54,282
Nope, but they can't be
too hard to miss.

113
00:05:54,334 --> 00:05:57,785
The Witch and The Fool.
Iconic.

114
00:05:57,838 --> 00:06:01,005
How are The Witch and The Fool
supposed to see her…

115
00:06:04,211 --> 00:06:07,045
Oh!

116
00:06:07,097 --> 00:06:09,430
Ooh, which one do you think I am?

117
00:06:12,936 --> 00:06:16,971
You don't look like any
witches or fools I've seen here.

118
00:06:16,973 --> 00:06:18,306
Oh, wait.
Don't.

119
00:06:18,358 --> 00:06:19,974
It's… it's enchanted.

120
00:06:19,976 --> 00:06:21,309
It'll only make it worse.

121
00:06:21,361 --> 00:06:22,894
What's the point of these anyway?

122
00:06:22,946 --> 00:06:24,229
They're everywhere.

123
00:06:24,281 --> 00:06:25,730
Well, some animals can talk,

124
00:06:25,782 --> 00:06:27,649
so hunters have sort of
an ethical dilemma.

125
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:29,901
You know, you don't want to eat
something as smart as you,

126
00:06:29,953 --> 00:06:34,572
so anything
that can answer the riddle

127
00:06:34,624 --> 00:06:36,374
is set free.

128
00:06:36,409 --> 00:06:41,713
So, uh, "What is no sooner
broken than spoken?"

129
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,383
I have no idea.

130
00:06:46,503 --> 00:06:48,002
Silence.

131
00:06:51,141 --> 00:06:53,091
Silence.

132
00:06:54,644 --> 00:06:57,178
How'd you know the answer?

133
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,898
I, uh… read it.

134
00:07:01,318 --> 00:07:04,068
Brilliant.
Thank you, Witch and Fool.

135
00:07:04,104 --> 00:07:05,436
Ta-ta!

136
00:07:07,073 --> 00:07:09,691
Okay…
go.

137
00:07:09,693 --> 00:07:11,910
Geek out.
We're in the books.

138
00:07:11,945 --> 00:07:13,278
We are in the books.

139
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:17,615
<i>So remember how someone
followed us into Fillory?</i>

140
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:20,201
Hey, are you following us?

141
00:07:20,203 --> 00:07:23,204
It's totally cool if you are.

142
00:07:23,206 --> 00:07:24,706
Martin?

143
00:07:24,758 --> 00:07:26,708
He's not even
in this part of the book.

144
00:07:26,828 --> 00:07:33,324
_

145
00:07:34,768 --> 00:07:36,134
Still not sure I quite understand

146
00:07:36,186 --> 00:07:38,052
why you were following my sister.

147
00:07:38,054 --> 00:07:41,439
Well, why are you following
your sister?

148
00:07:41,474 --> 00:07:44,559
'Cause Fillory stopped taking you?

149
00:07:44,611 --> 00:07:45,977
Martin, I know you probably
think it's your fault,

150
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:48,563
but it's not.

151
00:07:48,615 --> 00:07:50,732
You want to be here because
you don't feel safe at home.

152
00:07:50,784 --> 00:07:53,785
And we want to help.

153
00:07:57,991 --> 00:07:59,657
What do you mean?

154
00:07:59,709 --> 00:08:01,459
Christopher Plover is
a very powerful Magician now.

155
00:08:01,494 --> 00:08:03,077
Maybe the most.

156
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:04,829
We think we can stop him
if we find something.

157
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:07,915
Um, it's a Fillorian knife,

158
00:08:07,917 --> 00:08:09,083
called the Leo Blade.

159
00:08:09,085 --> 00:08:10,668
Have you heard of it?

160
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,722
No, but I know someone who might've.

161
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:22,263
Nope, never heard of it.

162
00:08:22,315 --> 00:08:24,766
But it's something you're
more than capable of making,

163
00:08:24,768 --> 00:08:27,101
given your reputation.

164
00:08:27,153 --> 00:08:28,653
Though if you think it may be
too difficult…

165
00:08:28,688 --> 00:08:30,772
What in Hades is difficult
about a blade?

166
00:08:30,774 --> 00:08:33,941
- Well, this one…
- Has to kill a Master Magician.

167
00:08:33,994 --> 00:08:36,027
And he's not even human anymore.

168
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:39,330
Six fingers, dark spells
you've never seen before.

169
00:08:39,366 --> 00:08:42,116
Lad, fetch The Moonstones.

170
00:08:42,118 --> 00:08:44,035
Thing like that

171
00:08:44,087 --> 00:08:47,005
can only be killed
with a blade of Moonstones.

172
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,628
I have the only two in Fillory.

173
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,400
You couldn't even make
a needle with that.

174
00:08:55,432 --> 00:08:59,017
These aren't just rocks.
They're alive.

175
00:08:59,052 --> 00:09:02,470
I can mate them and breed more.

176
00:09:02,472 --> 00:09:05,356
Then why haven't you?

177
00:09:05,392 --> 00:09:08,643
Expensive.
Takes time.

178
00:09:08,695 --> 00:09:11,646
Care, feeding.
Years.

179
00:09:11,648 --> 00:09:13,398
And it's not often I'm called upon

180
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,901
to forge a Master Magician
murder weapon.

181
00:09:16,953 --> 00:09:21,539
But you are from a place
that likes murder: Earth.

182
00:09:21,574 --> 00:09:23,324
- Am I right?
- Yes, we're from Earth.

183
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:25,376
Good.
Then you know what I want.

184
00:09:25,412 --> 00:09:28,212
We do, and we agree.

185
00:09:28,248 --> 00:09:32,216
So what exactly did we promise
the knifemaker last night?

186
00:09:32,252 --> 00:09:33,885
Well, he knew we were from Earth.

187
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,003
And the rulers of Fillory
can only be from Earth.

188
00:09:36,005 --> 00:09:38,339
So he thinks we're…

189
00:09:38,341 --> 00:09:41,342
Kings and Queen.
He wants a seat at court.

190
00:09:41,344 --> 00:09:43,511
But years, it'll take him years.

191
00:09:43,513 --> 00:09:45,063
How…

192
00:09:50,854 --> 00:09:52,520
Holy shit.

193
00:09:56,943 --> 00:09:58,443
Oh, my God.

194
00:09:58,495 --> 00:10:00,745
Jules, it's Ember's Temple.

195
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,747
<i>It was as beautiful
as it was in the books,</i>

196
00:10:02,782 --> 00:10:05,533
<i>and standing there,
you could just feel</i>

197
00:10:05,585 --> 00:10:08,536
<i>that the gods were real.</i>

198
00:10:08,538 --> 00:10:12,623
<i>But in Fillory,
with magic comes danger.</i>

199
00:10:12,675 --> 00:10:14,759
She's coming!
The Watcherwoman!

200
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:17,712
Martin.
Wait.

201
00:10:17,764 --> 00:10:19,547
Martin!

202
00:10:27,807 --> 00:10:29,307
Holy shit.

203
00:10:29,794 --> 00:10:35,761
_

204
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,951
<i>In which we run into my
favorite random, scary villain</i>

205
00:10:39,986 --> 00:10:43,404
<i>from the books and she turns
out to be the exact opposite.</i>

206
00:10:43,456 --> 00:10:44,989
Quentin?

207
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:47,625
You know The Watcherwoman?

208
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,494
Oh, my God.
I do.

209
00:10:49,546 --> 00:10:52,079
Of course, I should have
put that together.

210
00:10:52,132 --> 00:10:53,915
Uh, this is my friend, Julia.

211
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:58,469
Julia, this is Jane Chatwin
all grown up.

212
00:10:58,505 --> 00:11:00,421
You're not supposed to be here yet.

213
00:11:00,473 --> 00:11:02,640
Haven't even been born yet.

214
00:11:02,675 --> 00:11:05,309
We know about time loops
that you keep making.

215
00:11:05,345 --> 00:11:06,811
Well, as you should by now.

216
00:11:06,846 --> 00:11:08,429
Right.

217
00:11:08,431 --> 00:11:10,264
So there have been 39 others…

218
00:11:10,316 --> 00:11:13,017
And you're the volunteer tomato.

219
00:11:13,069 --> 00:11:14,435
I'm sorry, what?

220
00:11:14,437 --> 00:11:16,437
In a garden, you pull everything up.

221
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:19,157
Sometimes a stray vine
just keeps coming back.

222
00:11:19,192 --> 00:11:21,609
It volunteers.

223
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:25,196
That's really why you,
Quentin, you just keep coming.

224
00:11:25,248 --> 00:11:27,498
Right.
Okay.

225
00:11:27,534 --> 00:11:32,119
So, okay… I'm the tomato.

226
00:11:32,172 --> 00:11:34,455
And this is the last time.

227
00:11:34,457 --> 00:11:36,841
Why is this the last one?

228
00:11:36,876 --> 00:11:38,342
Oh…

229
00:11:40,046 --> 00:11:44,298
Uh, well you die this time.

230
00:11:45,969 --> 00:11:47,685
Huh.

231
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,687
I see.

232
00:11:49,722 --> 00:11:51,556
Do I die doing something brave?

233
00:11:51,608 --> 00:11:54,192
- Very.
- Right, then.

234
00:11:54,227 --> 00:11:57,395
If you survive, see to it that I
get a proper temple in my honor.

235
00:11:57,447 --> 00:12:01,732
Granite statue, good likeness,
mind the chin.

236
00:12:01,784 --> 00:12:03,367
I'll put that at the top of my list.

237
00:12:03,403 --> 00:12:04,986
Can I ask a question?

238
00:12:04,988 --> 00:12:07,822
Why are you the Watcherwoman
and she's a villain?

239
00:12:07,874 --> 00:12:09,240
Am I?

240
00:12:09,292 --> 00:12:11,492
I mean, you scared the hell
out of everybody.

241
00:12:11,494 --> 00:12:14,412
Well, when I was a girl,
the Watcherwoman inspired me

242
00:12:14,464 --> 00:12:16,497
to learn magic to fight her.

243
00:12:16,549 --> 00:12:18,049
Indeed, I grew up to be

244
00:12:18,084 --> 00:12:20,334
just a touch stronger
than that Watcherwoman.

245
00:12:20,386 --> 00:12:22,887
That hurts my brain.

246
00:12:22,922 --> 00:12:25,339
Apparently wasn't enough.

247
00:12:26,843 --> 00:12:28,676
Least I learned some fun things,
like this.

248
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,733
Wait, what did you do?

249
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,356
Don't want her to hear us.

250
00:12:44,744 --> 00:12:48,112
There's a patch on your
friend's memory, quite crude.

251
00:12:48,164 --> 00:12:51,198
Made in haste, likely by a Hedge.

252
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,700
Could you remove it?

253
00:12:52,702 --> 00:12:55,002
No, it's there for a reason.

254
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:03,544
<i>Covering something… recent,
something tragic…</i>

255
00:13:03,546 --> 00:13:06,964
<i>Replacing it with something
beautiful but false.</i>

256
00:13:17,277 --> 00:13:20,311
My children, you have summoned me

257
00:13:20,363 --> 00:13:22,730
to shed your burdens

258
00:13:22,732 --> 00:13:25,066
and so they shall be.

259
00:13:29,572 --> 00:13:31,739
Julia.

260
00:13:34,127 --> 00:13:36,410
<i>I have a mission for you.</i>

261
00:13:39,382 --> 00:13:41,332
If you still care about her…

262
00:13:41,384 --> 00:13:42,416
Of course.

263
00:13:42,418 --> 00:13:45,419
Protect her.

264
00:13:45,471 --> 00:13:47,588
I'm sorry I couldn't protect you.

265
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:51,342
That was never your job, Quentin.

266
00:13:51,394 --> 00:13:52,510
Right, then.

267
00:13:56,182 --> 00:13:57,865
Sorry, what were you guys saying?

268
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,434
So, Jane, um,
could you zoom us forward

269
00:14:00,486 --> 00:14:02,436
to the present… our present?

270
00:14:05,775 --> 00:14:07,608
Good-bye, Quentin.

271
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:10,077
Godspeed.

272
00:14:12,349 --> 00:14:15,172
_

273
00:14:15,292 --> 00:14:16,292
Jesus…

274
00:14:16,336 --> 00:14:18,619
<i>Welcome to Fillory 2016.</i>

275
00:14:18,671 --> 00:14:20,788
It's a lot colder.

276
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:23,290
It's like being in a fog
that never lifts.

277
00:14:23,343 --> 00:14:26,210
Yeah.

278
00:14:26,262 --> 00:14:29,797
Ow.
Jesus.

279
00:14:33,553 --> 00:14:36,554
"Enchanted this to find you
if you ever arrive.

280
00:14:36,606 --> 00:14:38,689
"Hope you're not dead.

281
00:14:38,725 --> 00:14:40,891
"Margo being such a bitch.

282
00:14:40,943 --> 00:14:44,395
Follow map to find us.
El."

283
00:14:44,447 --> 00:14:47,231
Come on.

284
00:14:47,283 --> 00:14:50,868
<i>Welcome to the Fillory of The Beast.</i>

285
00:14:50,903 --> 00:14:52,653
<i>And this is what happens</i>

286
00:14:52,655 --> 00:14:54,822
<i>to a world ruled by
the worst kind of predator…</i>

287
00:14:54,874 --> 00:14:59,543
<i>the kind of monster
who destroys childhood.</i>

288
00:15:01,464 --> 00:15:02,830
Cheers, B.

289
00:15:09,756 --> 00:15:11,756
<i>As soon as I saw them, I remembered,</i>

290
00:15:11,808 --> 00:15:14,759
<i>"Oh, we kind of
all slept with each other</i>

291
00:15:14,811 --> 00:15:16,394
<i>"and hate each other right now.</i>

292
00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:18,846
<i>And that is largely my fault."</i>

293
00:15:18,848 --> 00:15:21,015
Really good to see you again, Q,

294
00:15:21,017 --> 00:15:23,768
but, um, why am I looking
at the Hedgebitch

295
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,186
who tried to kill you?

296
00:15:25,188 --> 00:15:26,687
We worked it out.

297
00:15:26,689 --> 00:15:28,439
I wouldn't be here without her, so…

298
00:15:28,491 --> 00:15:30,858
I'm here.
You don't have to like me.

299
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,194
Oh, don't you worry.

300
00:15:33,246 --> 00:15:35,112
We don't.

301
00:15:39,368 --> 00:15:41,619
So do you know where The Beast
is holding Victoria or not?

302
00:15:41,671 --> 00:15:45,206
I think the dungeon is in
The Castle That Isn't There.

303
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,041
That's the stupidest name
I've ever heard.

304
00:15:47,093 --> 00:15:50,377
You didn't just do shots with
a bulldog named Bristlycoat.

305
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,764
It's a kind of Phosphoromancy.
Alice, you could explain it…

306
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,467
um, better.

307
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:58,552
How much further to this knifemaker?

308
00:15:58,554 --> 00:16:01,105
These shoes weren't cobbled
for a quest.

309
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:03,891
Right over here, I think.

310
00:16:03,943 --> 00:16:05,976
Not another one.

311
00:16:06,028 --> 00:16:07,061
What?

312
00:16:07,063 --> 00:16:09,563
They're everywhere.

313
00:16:09,615 --> 00:16:12,983
Plus headstones, unmarked graves.

314
00:16:13,035 --> 00:16:15,953
Oh, no.

315
00:16:15,988 --> 00:16:18,456
<i>We'd hoped that Martin
was still out there somewhere,</i>

316
00:16:18,491 --> 00:16:22,460
<i>that we could save him,
but we took too long.</i>

317
00:16:22,495 --> 00:16:23,744
<i>We failed him.</i>

318
00:16:23,746 --> 00:16:26,080
All the Chatwins are dead.

319
00:16:26,132 --> 00:16:30,167
Wow, your childhood fantasy
is a great big magical Dachau.

320
00:16:47,754 --> 00:16:49,135
_

321
00:16:49,255 --> 00:16:52,565
_

322
00:16:55,329 --> 00:16:58,331
<i>The knifemaker's house
was largely the same in 2016,</i>

323
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:01,418
<i>but now it was run by a stranger.</i>

324
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,920
I remember you.

325
00:17:03,972 --> 00:17:06,423
I must say, you've aged well,
the two of you.

326
00:17:06,475 --> 00:17:08,008
Um…

327
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,094
I was eight.
Apprentice to my father.

328
00:17:11,146 --> 00:17:12,846
Is he around?

329
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:14,014
He's out back.

330
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,516
Six feet under grass.

331
00:17:16,518 --> 00:17:17,851
You know, he grew a little aggravated

332
00:17:17,853 --> 00:17:19,686
waiting for you two to come back.

333
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:33,283
The Leo Blade, as promised.

334
00:17:36,004 --> 00:17:39,122
Payment is due.

335
00:17:39,174 --> 00:17:41,374
As promised.

336
00:17:41,426 --> 00:17:43,543
Here's the thing:
all the Chatwins are dead,

337
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:45,762
Fillory has no rulers,
and the only people from Earth

338
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:48,298
left here now not locked
in a dungeon…

339
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,634
Oh, my God.
I'm going to be royalty.

340
00:17:50,686 --> 00:17:53,887
Yeah, I mean,
we all are the next wave.

341
00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:57,390
So what he wants is to become
future royalty by marriage.

342
00:17:57,442 --> 00:17:58,809
Wait, he wants to marry one of us?

343
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:00,610
No, thank God.

344
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:04,731
He wants one of us
to marry her… his daughter.

345
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:06,950
Huh.

346
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:09,402
I mean, you know,
team player and stuff.

347
00:18:09,404 --> 00:18:11,621
Hey, who says it's you anyway?

348
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:15,125
It's not a volunteer gig,
and she doesn't get to pick.

349
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:20,580
This blade draws one thing
and one thing only:

350
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:24,417
the pure royal blood
of the High King of Fillory.

351
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:28,755
<i>I admit, I was 100% sure that
I was definitely the High King.</i>

352
00:18:31,927 --> 00:18:33,260
Hm.

353
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,762
<i>I know!
Shocking, right?</i>

354
00:18:35,764 --> 00:18:37,480
<i>You may be wondering
why they set it up</i>

355
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:39,099
<i>that aliens must rule Fillory</i>

356
00:18:39,101 --> 00:18:41,768
<i>and I'm sure there is a great reason</i>

357
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:45,105
<i>and nobody has any clue what that is.</i>

358
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:47,023
<i>Ember and Umber set it up</i>

359
00:18:47,075 --> 00:18:48,825
<i>and they're not that into
explaining their big ideas</i>

360
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,443
<i>and, you know, you'd think</i>

361
00:18:50,445 --> 00:18:51,661
<i>it would be centaurs
or something, right?</i>

362
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:54,281
<i>I would do centaurs, but nope.</i>

363
00:18:54,283 --> 00:18:57,500
So what exactly is supposed to…

364
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:00,287
Oh!

365
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,122
Get the fuck out.

366
00:19:02,124 --> 00:19:04,174
Well, High King.

367
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:07,544
Makes certain instinctual sense,
I guess.

368
00:19:07,596 --> 00:19:09,179
Your Majesty.

369
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:12,215
Oh, this'll make him
easier to live with.

370
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:17,572
_

371
00:19:21,443 --> 00:19:23,193
So there's a bump.

372
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:27,197
Bigger than marrying
a total stranger-ette?

373
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:29,983
Apparently marriage here
is different.

374
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:31,151
Really different.

375
00:19:31,153 --> 00:19:33,153
Right, but as High King,

376
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:34,654
I can get, like, a royal annulment.

377
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:37,490
No, never.

378
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:41,878
Once you get married, you won't
be able to be with anyone else

379
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:44,497
literally for the rest of your life.

380
00:19:44,499 --> 00:19:47,050
Here, but when I go back, I can…

381
00:19:50,222 --> 00:19:53,340
I can never leave Fillory.

382
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:56,593
Jesus.

383
00:19:56,645 --> 00:19:58,178
El, you don't have to do this.

384
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,230
No, don't.

385
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,689
I'm doing this.

386
00:20:09,691 --> 00:20:11,908
- Eliot…
- Margo.

387
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,277
I am miserable.

388
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:16,780
My life, it doesn't work.

389
00:20:16,832 --> 00:20:18,531
Nothing's ever fixed that.

390
00:20:18,533 --> 00:20:21,785
Drugs, sex, food, booze.

391
00:20:21,837 --> 00:20:23,203
Not even magic.

392
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:26,373
But maybe it all led to this, to now,

393
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:29,542
for a reason that's actually
finally going to make my life

394
00:20:29,544 --> 00:20:32,712
not just about me,
and my thoughts, and my feelings.

395
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:35,548
- Something…
- Bigger.

396
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,934
How wise you are,

397
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:41,721
Queen Margo The Destroyer.

398
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,562
Um…

399
00:20:52,567 --> 00:20:57,320
Is it okay if I hate
that you're getting married?

400
00:20:57,372 --> 00:20:59,239
Shit.

401
00:20:59,241 --> 00:21:01,862
I think you're the only person
that I can stand.

402
00:21:01,982 --> 00:21:03,743
You know what that means?

403
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:07,664
You have to be my Best Man.

404
00:21:07,716 --> 00:21:09,916
God.

405
00:21:11,887 --> 00:21:13,670

Fen.

414
00:21:33,552 --> 00:21:36,276
Nice to meet you.

415
00:21:36,278 --> 00:21:38,495

Okay, okay, where are you?

00:21:55,931 --> 00:21:58,298

00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,643
That's hot.

427
00:22:19,695 --> 00:22:21,277
Here, maybe it's just for High Kings.

428
00:22:21,313 --> 00:22:24,447
Oh, Jesus!

429
00:22:24,483 --> 00:22:27,901
Okay, Father-in-law,
why is this blade 1,000 degrees?

430
00:22:27,953 --> 00:22:30,654
It may only be handled by
Master Magicians.

431
00:22:30,706 --> 00:22:32,572
Are none of you Masters?

432
00:22:32,624 --> 00:22:34,324
Okay, I found the castle.
We can…

433
00:22:34,376 --> 00:22:35,742
Oh, cool!

434
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:39,579
I hate this place!

435
00:22:40,034 --> 00:22:43,536
_

436
00:22:47,626 --> 00:22:49,336
There has to be a trick, right?

437
00:22:49,656 --> 00:22:51,648
We can't trick it into
thinking we're powerful.

438
00:22:51,768 --> 00:22:53,269
I mean, the trick
is we have to be that powerful.

439
00:22:53,389 --> 00:22:55,088
I gather the crowd
you usually hang with

440
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:57,508
nods like you're smart when
you say incredibly obvious shit,

441
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,226
but what we need is ideas.

442
00:22:59,261 --> 00:23:01,011
That's a good idea.
We need the power of a god.

443
00:23:01,063 --> 00:23:03,397
Yeah, or gods.
Ember and Umber.

444
00:23:03,432 --> 00:23:06,350
Who haven't been seen for
decades, so good luck with that.

445
00:23:06,402 --> 00:23:08,602
Okay, I have a much less
idiotic idea.

446
00:23:08,654 --> 00:23:10,070
Why don't we use a Magician

447
00:23:10,105 --> 00:23:11,238
who's actually been around
The Beast…

448
00:23:11,273 --> 00:23:12,739
the girl from his dungeon.

449
00:23:12,775 --> 00:23:15,192
So much less idiotic
it's almost good.

450
00:23:15,244 --> 00:23:17,528
I'm with Penny.

451
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,780
Eliot?

452
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:23,433
Yeah, according to the fine
print not actually written down,

453
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:25,869
I have a virgin farm girl
to impregnate.

454
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,437
Right this second?

455
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:29,006
This very one.

456
00:23:31,961 --> 00:23:35,629
Best of luck, all.
You're welcome.

457
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:37,264
Mrs. Me?

458
00:23:41,971 --> 00:23:44,221
If I die while
he's balling himself limp,

459
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:45,973
I will haunt the shit out of his ass.

460
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,810
You're fucking kidding me.

461
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:52,112
That's why they call it
The Castle That Isn't,

462
00:23:52,147 --> 00:23:53,730
'cause it's invisible.

463
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,816
<i>The truth is,
the castle was constructed</i>

464
00:23:55,868 --> 00:23:58,452
<i>to be invisible primarily
for budgetary reasons.</i>

465
00:23:58,487 --> 00:24:00,737
<i>The royals had spent their
entire seasonal allowance</i>

466
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:03,290
<i>and then realized they still
had a castle to build,</i>

467
00:24:03,325 --> 00:24:06,076
<i>so they figured builder's grade
material is just fine</i>

468
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:07,578
<i>if you can't see it.</i>

469
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,746
You guys run, I'll distract 'em.

470
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:13,584
Don't be stupid.
They're men.

471
00:24:13,586 --> 00:24:15,969
My sister!
Please, help!

472
00:24:18,974 --> 00:24:22,009
She just fainted.
Can one of you do something?

473
00:24:22,061 --> 00:24:24,928
Hey, hey.

474
00:24:26,815 --> 00:24:28,348
I need help.

475
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,150
You all right, miss?

476
00:24:30,185 --> 00:24:32,486
Where am I?

477
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,782
Victoria.

478
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:47,701
Whoa… hey, hey.

479
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:50,120
Hey, we're here to get you out.
Okay, we're here to get you out.

480
00:24:50,172 --> 00:24:52,172
The cuffs…
I can't…

481
00:24:52,207 --> 00:24:53,457
They keep you from Travelling.

482
00:24:53,509 --> 00:24:54,958
Yeah.

483
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,843
We'll get 'em.

484
00:24:56,879 --> 00:24:58,178
Can you walk?

485
00:24:58,213 --> 00:25:01,048
There's someone else
in the next cell.

486
00:25:02,768 --> 00:25:03,967
<i>Ember?</i>

487
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:06,970
We need to talk to you.

488
00:25:07,022 --> 00:25:08,639
<i>So here we are at the temple,</i>

489
00:25:08,691 --> 00:25:12,025
<i>hoping against hope and all that.</i>

490
00:25:12,061 --> 00:25:13,944
Ah!

491
00:25:14,064 --> 00:25:16,982
_

492
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,735
It is customary to bow,

493
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:24,121
Children of Earth.

494
00:25:34,717 --> 00:25:37,050
Have you brought me little cakes?

495
00:25:37,086 --> 00:25:39,336
- No.
- Uh…

496
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:41,838
We didn't really know
that we were supposed to.

497
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,557
Oh.

498
00:25:43,592 --> 00:25:47,394
And I am so tired of eating mice.

499
00:25:48,931 --> 00:25:52,399
No matter.

500
00:25:52,434 --> 00:25:56,436
And you are?

501
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:59,690
Uh, I'm Quentin Coldwater.

502
00:25:59,742 --> 00:26:01,108
And Julia Wicker.

503
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,609
Huh.

504
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:04,578
Spank my cheeks.

505
00:26:04,613 --> 00:26:05,862
You're usually dead by now.

506
00:26:05,914 --> 00:26:08,198
He kills you

507
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,951
and I'm left here to hide
like an animal

508
00:26:11,003 --> 00:26:15,205
in horrid, arid,
cake-deficient Loria,

509
00:26:15,257 --> 00:26:18,041
but you're here.

510
00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:21,378
What happened?

511
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:23,880
What are you…
what are you doing here?

512
00:26:23,932 --> 00:26:27,050
He lured me into a trap, of course.

513
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:28,435
The Beast?

514
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:31,054
As you call him, yes.

515
00:26:31,106 --> 00:26:35,275
He snared me
and my dead, departed Umber.

516
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,560
Wait, Umber's dead?

517
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:39,229
It's unseemly, all of it.

518
00:26:41,283 --> 00:26:42,399
I'm sorry.

519
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:43,900
I don't mean to disrespect,

520
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:47,237
but how could a Magician
put the drop on you?

521
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:49,823
Fillory's magic belongs to no one,

522
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:51,742
not even a god.

523
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:54,327
A Magician with enough determination

524
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:59,633
can harness its forces and make
haggis of any one of us.

525
00:26:59,668 --> 00:27:00,967
Hm.

526
00:27:01,003 --> 00:27:04,638
So now I just wait till he is slain.

527
00:27:04,673 --> 00:27:07,974
I'm so fucking bored,
Children of Earth.

528
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:09,509
Ha!

529
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:11,845
I've had sex with every nymph
in the kingdom.

530
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:15,932
Well, we're here to help.

531
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:17,517
But you're not a nymph.

532
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:20,237
No, I'm…

533
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:24,274
What the fuck is wrong with you?

534
00:27:24,326 --> 00:27:26,860
- Pray pardon?
- What are you doing here?

535
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:29,613
You're just gonna let The Beast
trample the shit out of Fillory?

536
00:27:29,665 --> 00:27:31,615
You think that I want to be here?

537
00:27:31,667 --> 00:27:33,617
I think you're being
kind of a whiny bitch.

538
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:34,668
Q, maybe don't insult…

539
00:27:34,703 --> 00:27:37,337
No, does he care or not?

540
00:27:37,372 --> 00:27:38,955
You're right.

541
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:43,210
Years trying to outwit him.

542
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:46,880
Greatest failure, deepest shame.

543
00:27:46,932 --> 00:27:50,717
And now he is prepared
for anything I do.

544
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:53,520
It's not I who can defeat him,

545
00:27:53,555 --> 00:27:55,355
not directly.

546
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:03,480
I'll do it.

547
00:28:03,532 --> 00:28:06,199
I volunteer.
I'll kill The Beast.

548
00:28:06,235 --> 00:28:07,734
I love Fillory.
I don't know why.

549
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:11,321
But I am supposed to be here.

550
00:28:11,373 --> 00:28:13,323
I'm supposed to fight for it.

551
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:17,327
Can you be the champion
we've been waiting for?

552
00:28:17,379 --> 00:28:20,664
I want to be.

553
00:28:20,716 --> 00:28:22,999
I'm ready to be.

554
00:28:23,051 --> 00:28:24,551
I'll do whatever it takes.

555
00:28:24,586 --> 00:28:28,839
You love Fillory.

556
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:31,057
And you never stopped.

557
00:28:31,093 --> 00:28:32,759
Julia stopped.

558
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:35,345
I mean, maybe in college,
but now I totally…

559
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:39,065
Yes, you see, she stopped.

560
00:28:39,101 --> 00:28:42,185
But you never did.

561
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:47,607
Only the best and the purest
can face The Beast,

562
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:51,695
and that is you.

563
00:28:51,747 --> 00:28:53,363
Right, okay, so here's the thing,

564
00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:55,699
I can't really touch the knife
that can kill The Beast.

565
00:28:55,751 --> 00:28:57,117
Yes, you need my strength.

566
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:59,452
I will infuse you with…

567
00:28:59,505 --> 00:29:02,539
my essence.

568
00:29:02,591 --> 00:29:04,758
I have gifted you my Bestowal,

569
00:29:04,793 --> 00:29:07,878
my Largesse, the seed of my power.

570
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,431
When you are ready to face The Beast,

571
00:29:11,466 --> 00:29:13,717
imbibe it.

572
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:16,303
Is that semen?

573
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:22,275
Thank you.

574
00:29:22,311 --> 00:29:25,278
Thank you.

575
00:29:25,314 --> 00:29:27,614
And you, Daughter of Earth.

576
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,403
Hm.

577
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:36,907
Your mind is encumbered.

578
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:38,124
A shroud.

579
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,492
- No…
- What?

580
00:29:39,545 --> 00:29:41,578
- Crudely made.
- Ember, no, it's okay…

581
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,914
- I shall remove it.
- Remove what?

582
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:45,298
No, no, don't!

583
00:29:45,334 --> 00:29:47,584
Oh, God.
Jules!

584
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:49,669
You're welcome.
No need to thank me.

585
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,672
Best of luck.

586
00:29:56,703 --> 00:29:58,335
_

587
00:29:58,455 --> 00:30:00,456
- Jules…
- Please.

588
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:01,583
Please, don't…

589
00:30:01,703 --> 00:30:03,626
please don't touch me,
please don't…

590
00:30:03,678 --> 00:30:05,461
Hey, hey.
Jules, come on.

591
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:06,629
What happened?

592
00:30:06,631 --> 00:30:08,798
Just tell me, please.

593
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,717
Can you take my memory?

594
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:12,468
Please, take my memory.

595
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,520
I don't know how.

596
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,461
I may have to go.

597
00:30:23,354 --> 00:30:26,482
<i>I knew Julia wouldn't tell me
until she was ready,</i>

598
00:30:26,484 --> 00:30:29,152
<i>but that might be never.</i>

599
00:30:34,759 --> 00:30:36,759
Here.

600
00:30:39,132 --> 00:30:41,108
Thank you.

601
00:30:41,225 --> 00:30:43,025
Any time.

602
00:30:44,645 --> 00:30:46,061
Honestly, I was getting pretty sick

603
00:30:46,063 --> 00:30:47,562
of hearing your voice in my head.

604
00:30:47,614 --> 00:30:50,282
I wanted to help you so badly.

605
00:30:50,317 --> 00:30:51,900
I'm sorry I…

606
00:30:51,902 --> 00:30:53,568
Don't be.

607
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:55,821
You found me.

608
00:30:55,873 --> 00:30:58,407
Look, is there some trick?

609
00:30:58,409 --> 00:31:01,159
How do you take people along?

610
00:31:01,211 --> 00:31:03,078
Any of us can.

611
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:05,547
Well, I-I can barely
Travel me.

612
00:31:11,305 --> 00:31:13,221
They're a spell.

613
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:17,642
Ew.
Literally?

614
00:31:17,678 --> 00:31:18,927
So the dungeon?

615
00:31:18,979 --> 00:31:21,480
Roaring success, and a twofer.

616
00:31:21,515 --> 00:31:24,099
Sorry?

617
00:31:24,151 --> 00:31:26,435
We should see if he's awake by now.

618
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,163
Oh, my God.

619
00:31:38,198 --> 00:31:41,783
- That's Christopher Plover.
- What?

620
00:31:41,835 --> 00:31:43,335
We were wrong about everything.

621
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:46,955
Plover's not The Beast.

622
00:31:46,957 --> 00:31:50,008
No.

623
00:31:50,043 --> 00:31:52,294
Martin Chatwin is.

624
00:31:58,435 --> 00:32:00,302
I loved Martin.

625
00:32:00,304 --> 00:32:04,689
But there's something black
inside him I failed to see.

626
00:32:04,725 --> 00:32:06,975
Look at the markings on his face.

627
00:32:06,977 --> 00:32:09,311
Age suspension magic,

628
00:32:09,313 --> 00:32:13,815
so every day he can start over.

629
00:32:13,817 --> 00:32:15,150
Yeah, poor you.

630
00:32:15,152 --> 00:32:17,402
We need to find Martin.

631
00:32:17,454 --> 00:32:20,655
Why?
You can't stop him.

632
00:32:20,707 --> 00:32:24,493
Tell us everything or
I'm going to feed you to him.

633
00:32:26,914 --> 00:32:28,830
When he was still a child,

634
00:32:28,832 --> 00:32:31,500
<i>Fillory stopped taking him.</i>

635
00:32:31,552 --> 00:32:34,002
<i>Once he found his way back,</i>

636
00:32:34,004 --> 00:32:37,722
<i>he made it his mission to stay.</i>

637
00:32:37,758 --> 00:32:40,258
<i>He'd heard about The Wellspring,</i>

638
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:44,095
<i>the most ancient location in Fillory.</i>

639
00:32:44,148 --> 00:32:46,598
Which is what?

640
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:50,268
The source of all magic.

641
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,523
It's not only stronger than
Ember and Umber,

642
00:32:54,575 --> 00:32:56,274
it created them.

643
00:32:56,326 --> 00:32:59,027
Fillory runs on it.

644
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:02,781
<i>Martin goes every night
to drink from it,</i>

645
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:06,368
<i>draining it a little more each time.</i>

646
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:10,205
<i>The Wellspring's magic is so strong</i>

647
00:33:10,257 --> 00:33:12,541
<i>it killed…</i>

648
00:33:12,543 --> 00:33:15,210
<i>every human thing in him.</i>

649
00:33:15,212 --> 00:33:17,646
<i>There's only The Beast now.</i>

650
00:33:17,681 --> 00:33:19,548
So he goes to the Wellspring
every night,

651
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:21,433
but it's not on any map.

652
00:33:21,468 --> 00:33:23,718
Guess I can start asking around.

653
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,220
Or cast some kind of locator maybe?

654
00:33:25,272 --> 00:33:27,973
Or ask me.

655
00:33:28,025 --> 00:33:31,393
He never could hide his mind from me.

656
00:33:33,197 --> 00:33:35,063
Our connection.

657
00:33:35,065 --> 00:33:38,567
Okay, I vote we test the knife
out on him.

658
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:46,578
We gotta be careful with this.
Shhhhh.

659
00:33:46,696 --> 00:33:48,580
Josh come on we gotta go.

660
00:33:48,696 --> 00:33:50,579
<i>Yeah, Josh and Victoria bailed.</i>

661
00:33:50,614 --> 00:33:52,698
<i>On one hand, fuck 'em,
on the other hand,</i>

662
00:33:52,783 --> 00:33:54,783
<i>you can't really blame 'em.</i>

663
00:33:57,088 --> 00:33:58,871
<i>So I was writing this down</i>

664
00:33:58,956 --> 00:34:00,539
<i>because I didn't know much,</i>

665
00:34:00,624 --> 00:34:04,176
<i>but I knew that I was the hero
of this story.</i>

666
00:34:04,261 --> 00:34:06,762
<i>It all just felt like
the exact moment</i>

667
00:34:06,797 --> 00:34:09,298
<i>that my entire life
had been building up to,</i>

668
00:34:09,383 --> 00:34:12,518
<i>all of the reading, and dreaming,</i>

669
00:34:12,603 --> 00:34:16,238
<i>and loneliness, and magic.</i>

670
00:34:16,307 --> 00:34:19,007
<i>All of it.</i>

671
00:34:19,076 --> 00:34:20,642
<i>And then…</i>

672
00:34:20,728 --> 00:34:23,278
<i>well, and then this story
actually happened.</i>

673
00:34:23,314 --> 00:34:27,816
<i>And I started to realize the truth.</i>

674
00:34:53,177 --> 00:34:56,311
It's so insignificant…

675
00:34:56,347 --> 00:34:58,013
us being together and falling apart,

676
00:34:58,098 --> 00:34:59,932
I mean, it just doesn't matter.

677
00:35:00,017 --> 00:35:02,067
I made a mistake.

678
00:35:05,356 --> 00:35:08,323
I know you don't want to
hear it, but I love you.

679
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:11,493
You're right, I don't.

680
00:35:11,529 --> 00:35:16,448
But I'm not gonna go in there
angry at you.

681
00:35:16,534 --> 00:35:17,916
Okay, I've got your back, Quentin.

682
00:35:18,002 --> 00:35:21,286
We all do.

683
00:35:21,372 --> 00:35:25,257
You know, my entire life,

684
00:35:25,342 --> 00:35:27,426
ever since the first time I read
"Fillory and Further,"

685
00:35:27,511 --> 00:35:31,346
I've been waiting for some
powerful being

686
00:35:31,382 --> 00:35:34,466
to come down and say,
"Quentin Coldwater,

687
00:35:34,552 --> 00:35:36,301
you are The One."

688
00:35:40,107 --> 00:35:44,309
Every book, every movie,

689
00:35:44,395 --> 00:35:47,613
it's about one special guy.

690
00:35:47,698 --> 00:35:49,898
He's chosen.

691
00:35:49,984 --> 00:35:53,061
In real life, for every one guy,

692
00:35:53,181 --> 00:35:55,454
there are a billion people
who aren't.

693
00:35:56,907 --> 00:35:58,574
Almost none of us are the one.

694
00:35:58,659 --> 00:36:00,125
Ember said…

695
00:36:00,211 --> 00:36:03,662
Ember is a little
out of touch, I think.

696
00:36:09,253 --> 00:36:12,321
You're a better Magician.

697
00:36:12,389 --> 00:36:15,290
And you're a better person.

698
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:16,758
And I think that if he'd met you,

699
00:36:16,844 --> 00:36:18,727
he wouldn't be so sure that it's me.

700
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:21,847
But you're the one that they say

701
00:36:21,932 --> 00:36:23,932
shows up every single time, it's you.

702
00:36:24,018 --> 00:36:26,768
I want to be the one.
I do.

703
00:36:26,854 --> 00:36:29,104
It's just…

704
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:30,656
it's the adult part of me,

705
00:36:30,741 --> 00:36:32,774
the part of me that understands
how magic works,

706
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,910
it just… it just keeps screaming

707
00:36:34,945 --> 00:36:36,695
that it's you.

708
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:42,367
Every time that Jane reset the loop,

709
00:36:42,453 --> 00:36:44,419
she changed something.

710
00:36:46,757 --> 00:36:50,259
So what if I change something?

711
00:36:50,294 --> 00:36:52,511
What if I give the blade to you?

712
00:37:01,939 --> 00:37:04,940
You're not as good as I hoped,
Quentin Coldwater.

713
00:37:07,311 --> 00:37:09,194
But you're better than you know.

714
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:18,820
- Alice, you okay?
- Come on, hon.

715
00:37:18,906 --> 00:37:21,790
Pretend it's prom night and
you just want to shut him up.

716
00:37:36,974 --> 00:37:40,058
Did you Bogart the whole thing?

717
00:37:40,144 --> 00:37:41,476
Alice?

718
00:37:57,695 --> 00:38:00,829
Q, uh, can I…
can I talk to you?

719
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,957
Jules.
Talk to me.

720
00:38:12,042 --> 00:38:13,675
I did something.

721
00:38:13,711 --> 00:38:16,511
Me and my friends.

722
00:38:16,547 --> 00:38:19,514
We followed all the clues.

723
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:22,517
We thought
that She was leading us to Her.

724
00:38:22,553 --> 00:38:25,687
We summoned Her.

725
00:38:25,723 --> 00:38:29,858
You know, I actually believed
Our Lady Underground chose me.

726
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:46,241
Guys, stop.
We should stop.

727
00:38:52,249 --> 00:38:53,331
Julia.

728
00:38:53,417 --> 00:38:55,083
Dumb little witch.

729
00:38:55,169 --> 00:38:57,636
You can't unring a bell.

730
00:39:01,008 --> 00:39:02,090
Richard.

731
00:39:02,176 --> 00:39:03,258
Move!
Richard, move!

732
00:39:07,564 --> 00:39:09,097
- Stop her!
- Do something.

733
00:39:09,183 --> 00:39:10,823
- Can't use my magic.
- Nothing's working.

734
00:39:13,103 --> 00:39:14,603
Oh, God.

735
00:39:16,907 --> 00:39:18,690
You'll find I've taken away
your magic,

736
00:39:18,776 --> 00:39:20,826
so there's no point in trying.

737
00:39:24,448 --> 00:39:27,115
My thanks for opening the door.

738
00:39:27,201 --> 00:39:29,785
You may address me

739

741
00:39:33,924 --> 00:39:35,924

742
00:39:42,433 --> 00:39:44,132
Richard…

743
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:48,854
No, no!

744
00:39:54,311 --> 00:39:56,111
Kady…

745
00:39:56,146 --> 00:39:58,363
Julia, run, run.

746
00:39:58,449 --> 00:40:01,616
Kady, that was my hermit
who healed your heart.

747
00:40:01,652 --> 00:40:05,120
And now, I'm going to taste it.

748
00:40:05,155 --> 00:40:06,488
Don't you fucking touch her.

749
00:40:06,573 --> 00:40:08,957
When you address me…

750
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:11,243
avert your gaze.

751
00:40:11,328 --> 00:40:15,130
I said,
"Don't you fucking touch her."

752
00:40:15,165 --> 00:40:17,499
Fine.
I'll take you first.

753
00:40:21,255 --> 00:40:23,421
Kady, go.
Go!

754
00:40:24,842 --> 00:40:27,342
I chose you, Julia.

755
00:40:27,427 --> 00:40:29,678
From the first moment you prayed,

756
00:40:29,763 --> 00:40:32,147
I felt your body.

757
00:40:32,182 --> 00:40:34,566
I lifted it in my hands.

758
00:40:46,163 --> 00:40:49,531
I can give you the greatest
pleasure of your life.

759
00:40:49,616 --> 00:40:52,167
I can make you…

760
00:40:52,202 --> 00:40:54,836
Ow!

761
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,020
I need your help.
Something happened.

762
00:41:26,069 --> 00:41:27,402
Jesus.

763
00:41:27,487 --> 00:41:30,956
Thank you for coming.

764
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:34,159
- Whoa…
- I got you. I got you.

765
00:41:38,248 --> 00:41:40,465
The thing, where is it now?

766
00:41:41,969 --> 00:41:45,053
Gone.
Got what it wanted.

767
00:41:45,088 --> 00:41:47,389
I didn't know who else to call.

768
00:41:47,424 --> 00:41:48,723
You called the right person.

769
00:41:48,759 --> 00:41:49,891
I'm gonna help you clean this up.

770
00:41:49,927 --> 00:41:52,344
I'm gonna need another favor.

771
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:55,230
And I know it'll cost me,
but I don't care.

772
00:41:55,265 --> 00:41:56,815
Jesus, Julia, I want to help.

773
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:01,686

774

I need you to do it to me.

Please.

Jules.

777
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,834
Yeah, I know.
What the fuck were we thinking?

778
00:42:15,919 --> 00:42:17,419
You were trying to do good,

779
00:42:17,454 --> 00:42:19,421
and you got duped.

780
00:42:19,456 --> 00:42:23,041
It's not your fault.

781
00:42:23,126 --> 00:42:24,376
Jules, you saved Kady.

782
00:42:24,461 --> 00:42:26,678
Yeah, but what about everyone else?

783
00:42:27,881 --> 00:42:29,381
You know, what…

784
00:42:35,355 --> 00:42:37,272
Hey.

785
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,527
I'm going to help you.

786
00:42:44,364 --> 00:42:45,647
I promise, whatever that means.

787
00:42:45,732 --> 00:42:47,949
It means find him.

788
00:42:47,985 --> 00:42:52,704
It means kill him.

789
00:42:52,789 --> 00:42:54,572
And somehow I doubt that that's easy,

790
00:42:54,658 --> 00:42:57,909
or even possible.

791
00:42:57,995 --> 00:43:01,246
Well, impossible shit
is sort of our thing.

792
00:43:18,181 --> 00:43:20,398
The Wellspring of all magic?

793
00:43:20,484 --> 00:43:22,400
It's a truck stop shit-house.

794
00:43:22,486 --> 00:43:23,735
He'll be here soon.

795
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:25,570
Let's go.

796
00:44:08,196 --> 00:44:10,563
The fuck?

797
00:44:10,615 --> 00:44:12,148
It's Plover's writing room.

798
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,816
All that power,

799
00:44:13,868 --> 00:44:16,069
and he can't stop thinking about
where it happened.

800
00:44:16,121 --> 00:44:19,405
Fillory needs meds
way more than magic.

801
00:44:19,457 --> 00:44:21,324
Okay, so.

802
00:44:21,376 --> 00:44:24,077
Where's the actual Wellspring?

803
00:44:24,129 --> 00:44:27,297
Poor Martin.

804
00:44:27,332 --> 00:44:29,248
Okay, so…

805
00:44:35,924 --> 00:44:37,423
Quentin.

806
00:44:37,425 --> 00:44:40,560
Is it time for this already?

807
00:44:43,932 --> 00:44:44,932
Hi, Martin.

808
00:44:44,983 --> 00:44:47,600
We know it's you.

809
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:51,437
Mm.

810
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:57,493
Well, you made it a good
long way this time around.

811
00:45:00,582 --> 00:45:02,615
But this is it, Quentin.

812
00:45:02,667 --> 00:45:04,667
I know you're still in there.

813
00:45:04,703 --> 00:45:07,370
Look at this.

814
00:45:07,422 --> 00:45:09,038
You still feel, you're still hurt,

815
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:10,790
and you should be
after what happened to you.

816
00:45:10,842 --> 00:45:14,510
You mediocre are always
so sentimental.

817
00:45:14,546 --> 00:45:17,130
Although, must say,

818
00:45:17,132 --> 00:45:19,849

820
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:25,855
You're no quitter.

821
00:45:27,809 --> 00:45:29,025
Mm.

822
00:45:30,729 --> 00:45:32,895
Right.

823
00:45:32,947 --> 00:45:33,980
Let's get this over with.

824
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:35,732
Wait.

825
00:45:35,784 --> 00:45:37,483
I have an offer.

826
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:40,153
Jane gave me a message for you,

827
00:45:40,155 --> 00:45:42,872
a… a gift.

828
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:44,407
She said that you would want it,

829
00:45:44,459 --> 00:45:47,493
that… that you would
understand.

830
00:45:52,967 --> 00:45:55,334
Your stupid bloody cards.

831
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:59,756
Your stalling tactics haven't
gotten any less pathetic.

832
00:45:59,808 --> 00:46:02,558
Next time, put something useful
in your pocket.

833
00:46:02,594 --> 00:46:06,262
Oh, that's right.
No next time.

834
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:09,182
Shit!

835
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:13,686

837
00:46:19,411 --> 00:46:23,112
Oh, for the love of Christ,
children…

838
00:46:29,788 --> 00:46:30,788
Aah!

839
00:46:33,675 --> 00:46:35,425
Now…

840
00:46:38,096 --> 00:46:40,463
Quentin Coldwater.

841
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:47,804

843
00:46:59,367 --> 00:47:01,484
I need your help.
Something happened.

844
00:47:01,536 --> 00:47:02,902
Ow!

845
00:47:16,668 --> 00:47:19,919
Something's still happening.

846
00:47:24,259 --> 00:47:27,093
Stronger as well, I see.

847
00:47:27,145 --> 00:47:29,428
So many surprises.

848
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:31,764
So.

00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:15,294
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

71
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:22,368
[gasps] There you are.

72
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:25,504
We were so worried.

73
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,673
You're, uh…

74
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:35,181
God-powered.

75
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:38,551
So it's a little hard
to kill me at the moment.

76
00:03:42,323 --> 00:03:44,056
Ahh!

77
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:46,625
Thank God.

78
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:49,562
I mean, you know,

79
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:52,731
thank God, Alice.

80
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:57,570
[both gasping]

81
00:03:57,605 --> 00:03:59,071
I hesitated.

82
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:00,773
With The Beast,
I should have--it's--

83
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:01,941
it's my fault.

84
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:03,142
No, it's not, I--

85
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:04,443
No, he's right.

86
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:05,444
It's Julia's fault.

87
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,745
No, guys.

88
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:09,248
- She--she's not sane.
- You think?

89
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:10,549
One small consolation

90
00:04:10,585 --> 00:04:12,151
is the bitch is
with The Beast right now,

91
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:14,119
and I can't really see
that going her way.

92
00:04:14,155 --> 00:04:17,623
No, it, uh,
I'll explain it in a second.

93
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:20,426
Um, can I have my blood back, please?

94
00:04:20,461 --> 00:04:21,961
[chuckles]

95
00:04:21,996 --> 00:04:23,128
Look, my friends, they're fine.

96
00:04:23,164 --> 00:04:25,798
- I don't need your--
- No.

97
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,934
I took an hour out of my night.

98
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,303
You're in Fillory, Magician.

99
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:33,472
Be careful with strangers.

100
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:36,175
We only look whimsical.

101
00:04:39,714 --> 00:04:42,414
- Who was that?
- Uh, a local.

102
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,417
Okay, fuckers, huddle up.

103
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:47,353
Zillion bucks says The Beast
comes back any minute,

104
00:04:47,388 --> 00:04:48,687
so what's the plan?

105
00:04:48,723 --> 00:04:51,857
We lost the blade,
so we need a new something.

106
00:04:51,893 --> 00:04:54,260
Um, especially while Alice
is still--

107
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:55,928
- Juiced up?
- We should all juice up.

108
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:59,398
Like The Beast.
Wellspring smoothies, stat.

109
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:02,334
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

110
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:12,177
Ahh!
Shit.

111
00:05:12,213 --> 00:05:14,513
There's a missing piece right there.

112
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:16,482
Oh, hey, I think I--
uh, yeah.

113
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:18,784
[zapping]
Ahh!

114
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,219
This is going great.

115
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:22,187
Let me try.

116
00:05:29,764 --> 00:05:32,898
Wow, swallowing has its privileges.

117
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,973
[whirring and clicking]

118
00:05:52,954 --> 00:05:55,654
- Wow, it looks like--
- A major drought's hit.

119
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,823
There's a bucket.

120
00:06:03,297 --> 00:06:04,430
[rumbling]

121
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:06,398
Shit.

122
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:13,739
I knew The Beast came here
every day, but is it--

123
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:15,107
but is it even possible for him

124
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:16,809
to drain the Wellspring that much?

125
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:18,344
He really threw something
out of whack.

126
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,045
I vote we don't touch it
on the grounds

127
00:06:20,081 --> 00:06:21,947
that exploding Fillory wouldn't help.

128
00:06:21,983 --> 00:06:23,248
Okay.
We need a new plan.

129
00:06:23,284 --> 00:06:25,184
What plan?
The Beast is gone.

130
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:28,053
Our squad is a joke.
What plan, exactly?

131
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:29,755
We'll figure it out.
We always do.

132
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,390
When it's a final to cheat on,

133
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:33,625
not when we're stuck
in some epic fantasy

134
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:38,397
that likes to behead its heroes
halfway through season one.

135
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:41,867
If we even are heroes.

136
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:45,037
We might be comic relief.

137
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:48,941
I thought you threw that out.

138
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:52,011
It's for emergencies.
Pass it around.

139
00:06:52,046 --> 00:06:55,881
Okay.
No Wellspring, no knife.

140
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,117
I have no idea what to do now.

141
00:06:58,152 --> 00:07:00,019
So we are fucked without grease.

142
00:07:00,054 --> 00:07:03,822
- That sounds like us.
- Must be a Monday.

143
00:07:03,858 --> 00:07:05,858
Onward to glory.

- You familiar?
- Word as bond?

151

Uh, I assume the extra bits
enchant the blade

152
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:43,128
to kill me instantly

153

154
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:48,567
Okay, here's the deal--

00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:51,336
You need to kill a god.

156
00:07:51,372 --> 00:07:53,472
Thrilling.

157
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:55,174
So you need to get near him.

158
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:58,877
- Tricky.
- Yes, but you can help.

159
00:07:58,913 --> 00:08:00,879
Mm.

160
00:08:00,915 --> 00:08:04,083
His…name
is Reynard the Fox.

161
00:08:04,118 --> 00:08:07,386
A trickster of some sorts, yes?

162
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:09,221
Oh, that will be a challenge.

163
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:11,356
Well, you don't really have
much choice, do you?

164
00:08:11,392 --> 00:08:15,127
Oh, well aware you have
that stylish little blade.

165
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,129
I sure do.

166
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,765
That reminds me to insist
the terms of our deal

167
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,101
include said blade reverting to me

168
00:08:22,136 --> 00:08:24,603
at the moment of Reynard's demise.

169
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:26,872
- Agreed?
- Almost.

170
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:28,740
First, for the duration
of our agreement,

171
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:30,943
you do not hurt
or act against me in any way.

172
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:34,379
Mm, fine.

173
00:08:34,415 --> 00:08:36,882
Quentin, all of them.

174
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:39,918
You lay a finger,

175
00:08:39,954 --> 00:08:44,123
this will put this

176
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:47,793
in the base of your skull.

177
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:49,294
You're not what I expected.

178
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,764
Once Reynard is dead,
I put the knife down.

179
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,067
Yours to take.

180
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:57,836
So this Reynard's still out there?

181
00:08:57,872 --> 00:08:59,404
As far as she knows.

182
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,973
Yeah, it's why she needed the knife

183
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:02,441
and why she needs The Beast.

184
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:04,643
Okay, I get it now,
but I also have to say

185
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:07,746
that is the dumbest thing
she could possibly have done.

186
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:10,215
Like I said,
she's not sane right now.

187
00:09:10,251 --> 00:09:11,984
- I wouldn't be.
- So what are we supposed to do?

188
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:14,052
- Kill The Beast.
- He's right.

189
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:15,621
You know, it's awful,

190
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:17,256
but she chose
to double-cross us.

191
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,791
Look, I'm pissed too,
but I would like to point out--

192
00:09:19,827 --> 00:09:21,860
Okay, we don't have to take
a vote right this second.

193
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:23,495
Penny's right.
First things first.

194
00:09:23,531 --> 00:09:26,431
We need to make a plan
to deal with The Beast.

195
00:09:26,467 --> 00:09:27,933
Eliot!

196
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:29,268
I thought for sure you--

197
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:32,171
Yeah, me too.
Not yet.

198
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:34,573
Are--are you all right?

199
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:37,743
Um, I'll--I'll get everyone
something to eat.

200
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:39,912
That would be amazing.

201
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:45,684
I think I like her.

202
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,653
I hope I like her.

203
00:09:53,327 --> 00:09:55,928
Um, okay.
This might be something.

204
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:59,598
Um, so there's a-a-a place

205
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:00,966
called The Armory.

206
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:03,202
- Weapons?
- Books.

207
00:10:03,237 --> 00:10:06,271
Uh, So Rupert Chatwin,

208
00:10:06,307 --> 00:10:09,107
uh, he realizes that back home,

209
00:10:09,143 --> 00:10:10,409
World War II is still raging

210
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:13,078
and he tells Jane and Martin
that he is going--

211
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,914
he's--he's going to go fight.
Before he does,

212
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,984
uh, he spends all night
in The Armory reading.

213
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,853
Uh, and, uh, you know,
like, whatever he finds,

214
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:24,156
it doesn't say,

215
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:28,760
but his next move
is to petition Ember and Umber

216
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:30,262
for strength.

217
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,097
I mean, what--
what if he found something?

218
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,366
What if he found, uh, a spell

219
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:37,836
or a piece of, I don't know,
Fillorian Battle Magic

220
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:39,938
that was so strong
that he couldn't do it without--

221
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:41,707
- Without juice?
- Yeah, because the--

222
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:44,576
okay, the thing is, this is, uh,

223
00:10:44,612 --> 00:10:48,113
December, 1944.

224
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,881
I mean, he shows up
right in the middle of the--

225
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:53,585
Battle of the Bulge.

226
00:10:53,621 --> 00:10:57,189
Wait, are you saying
that Rupert secretly--

227
00:10:57,224 --> 00:10:59,725
I'm saying, uh…

228
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,129
maybe he found something
powerful enough to help.

229
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,365
And win World War II?

230
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,768
Maybe.

231
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:12,304
Well then, I need The Armory.
Where is it?

232
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:15,974
Castle Whitespire.
Accessible to…

233
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:16,975
the King.

234
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:19,311
Oh, hey.

235
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,747
And if we can find
the road, there's, um,

236
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:24,483
a carriage that runs
in a continuous circle, uh,

237
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:27,085
also at the disposal
of the King, so…

238
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:30,555
Okay.
Whitespire it is.

239
00:11:30,591 --> 00:11:33,792
Come on, everybody.
Grab snacks.

240
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:35,427
Yeah, uh, about that.

241
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:36,795
My hands are in a fucking box,

242
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,997
so Chatwin's Torrent.

243
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:42,134
I-I know that one.
It's, um, it's a healing river.

244
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:44,303
- Can it reattach hands?
- Maybe.

245
00:11:44,338 --> 00:11:46,505
I'm going.
I'll catch you on the flip.

246

00:22:02,456 --> 00:22:04,589
Oh, dear.

423
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:10,929
Oh, dear.
[grunts]

424
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:19,237
I am the Knight of Crowns.

425
00:22:19,273 --> 00:22:21,673
Uh, my apologies.

426
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:26,344
I seem to have died waiting
for you aspirants to come.

427
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:30,382
Y-y-you are aspirants?

428
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:32,083
Uh--
[clears throat]

429
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:34,853
I'm the High King of Fillory.

430
00:22:34,888 --> 00:22:36,187
I took a blood test.

431
00:22:36,223 --> 00:22:41,026
Excellent, excellent.
It's an honor.

432
00:22:41,061 --> 00:22:43,328
Can we have the crowns, please?

433
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:45,597
Certainly.
Honored to oblige.

434
00:22:45,632 --> 00:22:48,867
Just as soon as you pass the test.

435
00:22:48,902 --> 00:22:51,069
Of course there's a test.

436
00:22:51,104 --> 00:22:55,040
As you know, only a Child Of Earth

437
00:22:55,075 --> 00:22:58,710
can wear the crown of the High King.

438
00:22:58,745 --> 00:23:00,812
I will ask you a series of questions

439
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:03,548
designed to root out
all pretenders to the throne.

440
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:06,551
Only a true High King
will hold the answers

441
00:23:06,586 --> 00:23:08,720
in his heart.

442
00:23:11,158 --> 00:23:14,526
Come at me.

443
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:18,663
What popular American
television program

444
00:23:18,699 --> 00:23:21,633
stars actor Tim Daly?

445
00:23:21,668 --> 00:23:23,068
What the fuck?

446
00:23:23,103 --> 00:23:25,003
He was in a lot of TV shows.

447
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:26,838
There is only one correct answer.

448
00:23:26,873 --> 00:23:28,707
Okay.
Give me the next question.

449
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:33,211
This hit single
is performed by offspring

450
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:34,946
of famous entertainers.

451
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:37,716
Dude, that is crazy vague.

452
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:39,918
You will receive a single hint.

453
00:23:39,953 --> 00:23:42,821
Your hint is Beach Boys.

454
00:23:42,856 --> 00:23:46,257
Both: "Hold On"
by Wilson Phillips.

455
00:23:46,293 --> 00:23:47,926
That song is my jam.

456
00:23:47,961 --> 00:23:50,829
Wait, all these questions
are from the '90s.

457
00:23:50,864 --> 00:23:53,598
It--it's not the 1990s
on Earth right now?

458
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:55,400
No, it--it's 2017.

459
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:59,337
Oh, and it's, uh, "Wings,"
the--the Tim Daly show. "Wings."

460
00:23:59,373 --> 00:24:03,675
- Of course you know that.
- Okay, '90s.

461
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,344
Ask me something
about Patrick Swayze.

462
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,313
You know of Swayze?

463
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:20,658
Ahem.
[exhales sharply]

464
00:24:20,694 --> 00:24:22,293
"Sorry about the disruption, folks,

465
00:24:22,329 --> 00:24:25,230
"but I always do the last dance
of the season.

466
00:24:25,265 --> 00:24:27,165
"This year somebody told me not to.

467
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,367
"So I'm gonna do my kind of dancing

468
00:24:29,403 --> 00:24:30,935
"with a great partner,

469
00:24:30,971 --> 00:24:33,538
"who's not only a terrific dancer.

470
00:24:33,573 --> 00:24:36,307
"Somebody who's taught me

471
00:24:36,343 --> 00:24:38,309
"that there are people out there
willing to stand up

472
00:24:38,345 --> 00:24:41,880
"for other people
no matter what it costs them.

473
00:24:41,915 --> 00:24:46,084
"Somebody who's taught me

474
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:49,821
"about the kind of person
I want to be.

475
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:51,589
Miss Frances Houseman."

476
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:55,994
Oh, Your Majesty.

477
00:24:56,029 --> 00:24:59,964
The crowns of Fillory are yours.

478
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:17,914
So I guess we just put them on.

479
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,282
No, God, stop.

480
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:23,353
I mean, I just--
we should do a-a ceremony.

481
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:25,322
This is only gonna happen once.

482
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,324
We are becoming kings and queens,

483
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:33,063
so…it's important
and we should honor it.

484
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:37,467
Just give me that.

485
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:40,403
Kneel, Eliot Waugh.

486
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:43,807
Would you just do it?
It's gonna be quick, I promise.

487
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:52,782
So, destiny is--
it's bullshit.

488
00:25:52,818 --> 00:25:55,752
But you are High King in your blood.

489
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,854
And somehow that makes sense,
you know?

490
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,856
And I-I just--
for what it's worth,

491
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:03,660
I think that you are going to be
a really good king.

492
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:08,532
Um, so, um,
I-I dub thee,

493
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,901
um, I don't know.

494
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:13,303
Would you say, like,
you're more brave or merciful?

495
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,906
I'd say I'm neither.

496
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:19,409
But I still plan to be
a spectacular monarch.

497
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:21,878
I hereby dub thee

498
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,814
High King Eliot

499
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,384
the Spectacular.

500
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:34,791
Wow, uh,

501
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:37,961
this feels as natural as underwear.

502
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:45,669
Thank you.

503
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:48,471
By the power vested in me by…

504
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:51,608
I have no idea,

505
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:54,911
I do hereby crown you

506
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:58,548
High Queen Margo

507
00:26:58,584 --> 00:26:59,950
the Destroyer.

508
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:01,785
I mean that
in the best possible sense.

509
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:06,289
Uh, all hail.
Everyone clap.

510
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:08,458
[applause]

511
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:14,497
I have known what you truly are

512
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:17,434
since the day we met.

513
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,603
Long may you reign.

514
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:31,881
I feel it's incumbent upon me

515
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:36,419
to promise never again
to betray you like I did.

516
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:41,024
I really--
really am sorry.

517
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:45,595
I have some character defects.
I'm working on it.

518
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:47,764
Honestly.

519
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:57,407
I'm working on some too.

520
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:59,809
Well, on that note,

521
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:03,980
I crown you Queen Alice

522
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,749
the Wise.

523
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:17,627
No, wait.

524
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:20,797
Since we're cleaning slates
and shit, give me.

525
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:27,604
Q.

526
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:31,775
Uh, I could start
by saying something cruel

527
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,577
yet totally hilarious about you.

528
00:28:34,613 --> 00:28:39,215
Let's be real, you're an easy target.

529
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:40,984
But that's--

530
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:44,521
well, that's because you're
honest about what you love.

531
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,090
And underneath it all, that's…

532
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,526
inspiring.

533
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:53,196
And I'm sorry too.

534
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,597
Not about the sex,

535
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:57,400
I don't even really remember it.

536
00:28:57,436 --> 00:29:00,804
Mostly my part in fucking up
something that was good for you.

537
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:04,207
Thanks, I think
I fucked it up just fine myself.

538
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,509
Now that we're ruling
a kingdom together,

539
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:08,945
I hope we can be
whatever we were again.

540
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,648
I guess you could call that friends.

541
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:13,917
Let's go with that.

542
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:17,620
I hereby crown you King Quentin

543
00:29:17,656 --> 00:29:22,826
the Moderately Socially Maladjusted.

544
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:25,995
- Scrunch down.
- Yeah.

545
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:35,038
[applause]

546
00:29:36,675 --> 00:29:39,209
Royalty, bitches.

547
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:52,722
Okay.

548
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:01,231
Shit.
[grunts]

549
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:05,468
Hey, everything okay?

550
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:06,669
I'm going back to the Torrent.

551
00:30:06,705 --> 00:30:08,538
You think that guy
did something to you

552
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:10,673
'cause you were a raging douche?

553
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:12,308
I'll sweet-talk him.

554
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:14,911
Get him to fix my hands, then--
then I'll head to the castle.

555
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:17,080
Everything's under control.

556
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,963
[coughs] Alice.

557
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:39,102
Apology accepted.

558
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:43,573
That was you apologizing
for what you did.

559
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:45,308
I just--

560
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:48,778
if we survive this,
I hope we can be friends still.

561
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:55,285
I know it may sound stupid,

562
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,854
but that's what I'm mad at you for,

563
00:30:57,889 --> 00:31:01,424
not--not the cheating part.

564
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:07,030
The part where what you did
made me lose you.

565
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:09,132
And you're a big part
of my life, Quentin.

566
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:13,369
You can never lose me, Alice.

567
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:15,438
I mean, you can avoid me,
you can hate me--

568
00:31:15,474 --> 00:31:17,740
I don't hate you.

569
00:31:17,776 --> 00:31:20,543
Well, you can't lose me.

570
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:22,712
Sorry.

571
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:31,087
I just--
I can't stop thinking.

572
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:33,857
We're gonna find
this epic spell, great.

573
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:38,228
But I'm afraid I'm just gonna…

574
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:40,330
freeze again when The Beast
is in front of me.

575
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:43,066
You're thinking about it wrong.

576
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:44,541
Cool under pressure is not a talent.

577
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,836
It's a--it's a skill,
and you need to practice.

578
00:31:46,872 --> 00:31:51,207
You--come on.

579
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,443
We stood on a roof together
during the Trials,

580
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:54,844
and you told me that you were
afraid to see

581
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,681
what you're really capable of.

582
00:31:58,717 --> 00:32:01,985
[scoffs]
That was then.

583
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,687
So let's see what you can do now.

584
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:06,823
I'm not sure it'll help.

585
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:08,858
Then do it for me.
I'm not gonna lie.

586
00:32:08,894 --> 00:32:12,295
I--I'm dying to see
what you can do.

587
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,966
I'm not a Naturalist.

588
00:32:17,002 --> 00:32:18,601
You know the spell, we all do.

589
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:20,770
We just sucked at it.

590
00:32:24,843 --> 00:32:26,976
Let's see what you can do now.

591
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:44,694
Oh.
That feels…

592
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:48,898
it's just like breathing.

593
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:52,068
See?
Nice.

594
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:21,397
[chuckles]
So how do you feel now?

595
00:33:39,284 --> 00:33:41,584
We're not getting back together.

596
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,820
Okay.

597
00:33:55,746 --> 00:33:58,113
I've been wondering something.

598
00:33:58,148 --> 00:34:00,916
Why didn't Reynard kill you
with your friends?

599
00:34:00,951 --> 00:34:02,884
Why were you spared?

600
00:34:13,264 --> 00:34:15,030
You weren't spared, were you?

601
00:34:15,065 --> 00:34:17,199
Look, let's not go there, okay?

602
00:34:17,234 --> 00:34:19,468
You know, when I was a boy,

603
00:34:19,503 --> 00:34:21,770
a man who was meant to care for me

604
00:34:21,805 --> 00:34:24,940
bent me over his desk
and had me over and over

605
00:34:24,975 --> 00:34:27,676
every time I was alone with him.

606
00:34:27,711 --> 00:34:30,379
It helps me understand a truth.

607
00:34:30,414 --> 00:34:33,915
You're powerful or you're weak.

608
00:34:33,951 --> 00:34:37,719
If you're powerful, you will survive.

609
00:34:37,755 --> 00:34:40,555
So what, you're suggesting
I just get over it?

610
00:34:40,591 --> 00:34:42,724
Actually, yes.

611
00:34:45,529 --> 00:34:49,064
How?
Mutate?

612
00:34:49,099 --> 00:34:50,299
Take over a world,

613
00:34:50,334 --> 00:34:51,833
kill a bunch of grad students
39 times?

614
00:34:51,869 --> 00:34:56,305
[chuckles] Eh, see, what you feel,

615
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,440
the haunted look in your eyes,

616
00:34:58,475 --> 00:35:03,078
doesn't come from nowhere.

617
00:35:03,113 --> 00:35:05,347
Then where does it come from?

618
00:35:05,382 --> 00:35:07,182
In the center of your being,

619
00:35:07,217 --> 00:35:11,386
there's a tiny beating heart.

620
00:35:11,422 --> 00:35:13,488
What, you mean like my soul?

621
00:35:13,524 --> 00:35:16,091
Part of it, yes, the slimmest part,

622
00:35:16,126 --> 00:35:19,227
but it holds specific power.

623
00:35:19,263 --> 00:35:21,396
It's called a Shade.

624
00:35:21,432 --> 00:35:23,865
Shade.

625
00:35:23,901 --> 00:35:26,001
It's what makes you feel

626
00:35:26,036 --> 00:35:30,072
the pain will burn you
till there's nothing.

627
00:35:30,107 --> 00:35:32,407
And, yes, it's also there for love,

628
00:35:32,443 --> 00:35:34,242
but, uh, let's be frank, darling,

629
00:35:34,278 --> 00:35:36,311
you're more likely
to throw yourself off a bridge

630
00:35:36,347 --> 00:35:41,216
than ever love again.

631
00:35:41,251 --> 00:35:43,852
I felt that way.

632
00:35:43,887 --> 00:35:47,956
And I knew it crippled me
when I needed to be strong.

633
00:35:47,991 --> 00:35:49,925
As you do now.

634
00:35:56,667 --> 00:35:58,800
You know…

635
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:05,374
I don't care for people, as a rule.

636
00:36:11,882 --> 00:36:14,683
I like you.

637
00:36:14,718 --> 00:36:16,084
You have promise.

638
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:20,655
With the right control,
you would be formidable.

639
00:36:20,691 --> 00:36:25,160
Even a worthy collaborator.

640
00:36:25,195 --> 00:36:28,530
I have plans.
You could be part of them.

641
00:36:31,301 --> 00:36:33,535
- If?
- Do what I did.

642
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:36,638
Sever your shade.

643
00:36:36,673 --> 00:36:39,841
- Sever.
- It's not hard.

644
00:36:39,877 --> 00:36:42,744
You'll feel better.

645
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,347
You'll feel happy.

646
00:36:45,382 --> 00:36:47,516
I can show you how.

647
00:36:50,053 --> 00:36:52,821
No, thank you.

648
00:36:52,856 --> 00:36:55,991
Do let me know
if you change your mind.

649
00:37:02,032 --> 00:37:04,966
[humming]

650
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:13,041
<i>[soft music]</i>

651
00:37:42,105 --> 00:37:45,040
[indistinct chatter]

652
00:37:47,978 --> 00:37:49,678
Eliot!

653
00:37:49,713 --> 00:37:52,147
The crown suits you, of course.

654
00:37:52,182 --> 00:37:54,349
- Who are all these people?
- The Pickwick family.

655
00:37:54,384 --> 00:37:56,985
They've been running things
till Children of Earth came.

656
00:38:00,057 --> 00:38:01,122
Your Highness.

657
00:38:01,158 --> 00:38:02,924
Tick Pickwick
of the Northern Marsh Pickwicks,

658
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,192
at your service.

659
00:38:04,228 --> 00:38:06,495
The rest of the King's Council
will arrive shortly.

660
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:09,531
- Great.
- So glad you're here.

661
00:38:09,566 --> 00:38:11,500
There are a few problems.

662
00:38:11,535 --> 00:38:13,401
Uh, several problems

663
00:38:13,437 --> 00:38:14,903
that could use
your immediate attention.

664
00:38:14,938 --> 00:38:17,606
Ah, okay, great.
We should probably get started.

665
00:38:17,641 --> 00:38:19,841
First, your throne room.

666
00:38:19,877 --> 00:38:21,409
I'm afraid it's been locked
a long time.

667
00:38:21,445 --> 00:38:23,111
- We're looking for the key.
- That's fine.

668
00:38:23,146 --> 00:38:26,281
Uh, take me straight to the Armory.

669
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,053
[laughing]

670
00:38:36,827 --> 00:38:38,660
[laughing]

671
00:38:38,695 --> 00:38:40,829
[gasps]

672
00:39:02,986 --> 00:39:07,756
The Armory, your, uh, highnesses.

673
00:39:07,791 --> 00:39:09,925
Well, this is underwhelming.

674
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:13,094
This is supposed to be full of books.

675
00:39:15,933 --> 00:39:19,534
"Strategies for Trapping
Tomato-eating Garden Fairies."

676
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:21,570
Yeah, no.

677
00:39:21,605 --> 00:39:23,238
Someone took all the battle magic.

678
00:39:23,273 --> 00:39:26,007
It's not like The Beast
is coming to find us any second.

679
00:39:26,043 --> 00:39:28,143
Wait, this is something.

680
00:39:28,178 --> 00:39:31,413
It's an--it's a workbook
on spells, serious ones.

681
00:39:31,448 --> 00:39:33,148
Looks like battle magic.

682
00:39:33,183 --> 00:39:35,016
But the actual spells aren't here.

683
00:39:35,052 --> 00:39:38,553
Hmm, like notes on cake,
but no actual recipes.

684
00:39:38,589 --> 00:39:40,655
That's helpful.

685
00:39:40,691 --> 00:39:43,458
Who wrote it?

686
00:39:43,493 --> 00:39:45,627
- Oh, my God.
- What?

687
00:39:45,662 --> 00:39:47,796
I know where we need to go.

688
00:39:50,233 --> 00:39:51,733
Brakebills?

689
00:39:55,721 --> 00:39:59,481
Hello?
Mr., uh, Mr.--

690
00:39:59,721 --> 00:40:03,190
[grunting]

691
00:40:03,225 --> 00:40:06,726
Fuck!

692
00:40:06,762 --> 00:40:09,229
Can I help you?

693
00:40:09,264 --> 00:40:11,514
Hell, yes, you can.
These don't work.

694
00:40:11,634 --> 00:40:13,074
Well, by all means, request a refund.

695
00:40:13,102 --> 00:40:15,336
Very funny.
You did this on purpose.

696
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:18,305
Did what? Help an ungrateful
Child of Earth?

697
00:40:18,341 --> 00:40:19,782
Look, I'll pay you
whatever you want, okay?

698
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:21,050
I'm--I'm serious, okay?

699
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,518
I'm friends
with the kings and queens.

700
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:24,453
You want to be a duke,
great, I got you--

701
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:26,855
Actions have consequences, Penny.

702
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:29,792
Even glib words spoken
in casual arrogance.

703
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:31,894
It's past time you learned,

704
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,196
especially give the position
you'll occupy soon.

705
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:35,264
What position?

706
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:37,132
You know what?
I've done you a service.

707
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:39,234
No, no,
Look, hey, I'm--

708
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,904
I'm sorry, okay?

709
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:45,074
Please fix my hands.

710
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:48,377
See, how do I put this
in a way that you'll understand?

711
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:52,381
Ah, go fuck yourself.

712
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:56,018
No, wait!

713
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:57,987
Fuck!

714
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:03,659
Hang on to this while I'm gone.

715
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:06,462
Oh.

716
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:08,263
You guys all packed?

717
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:12,067
Yeah.

718
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:14,837
El, thank you.

719
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:17,539
For what?
For, um, taking one for the team

720
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:19,708
to the tune of the rest of my life?

721
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:24,446
[exhales deeply] I'm trying
to see this ruling thing

722
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,782
as an adventure.

723
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,385
Apparently we have enemies
to the north and south.

724
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:33,489
Plus broken infrastructure
and huge magic issues

725
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:36,325
thanks to The Beast
and his Wellspring addiction.

726
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,228
And do you know they don't know
what champagne is here?

727
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:43,098
I plan on inventing it.

728
00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:44,967
I'd like to be known as…

729
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:48,504
the Champagne King.

730
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:49,672
It has a ring to it.

731
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:51,240
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

732
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:54,343
I'm really looking forward
to drinking socially,

733
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:56,311
like the French.

734
00:42:01,419 --> 00:42:04,953
So, uh, in the books,

735
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:07,556
time doesn't exactly run
the same speed

736
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:11,226
on Earth as in Fillory.

737
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:12,795
I mean, look, sometimes it got screwy

738
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:15,698
when Jane and Martin
would go back and forth.

739
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:17,866
But not always.

740
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:22,037
It's gonna be fine.

741
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:25,708
Yeah.

742
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:27,142
Yeah.

743
00:42:27,178 --> 00:42:29,945
Or I'll just live out my days

744
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:34,149
waiting for my friends
to return and die alone.

745
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:43,392
You know, it's considered
extremely disrespectful

746
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:46,762
to touch a king without permission.

747
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:52,835
But, um, I think you should…

748
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:56,004
probably hug me right now.

749
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,178
[exhales deeply]

750
00:43:05,216 --> 00:43:06,915
It'll also be okay if you just

751
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:09,518
give my ass, like, a little squeeze.

752
00:43:09,553 --> 00:43:12,287
[laughter]

753
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:16,792
Feel free to, uh, double-check
this before I get started.

754
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:18,961
Julia?

755
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:33,809
Why do you want to help me

756
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:36,678
with my Shade?

757
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:38,180
Without your Shade,

758
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:42,851
you would see
a lot of things differently.

759
00:43:42,887 --> 00:43:46,688
You'd be able to live, Julia.

760
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:48,724
Come here.

761
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:50,893
Let me show you.

It's okay, it's okay.

767
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:31,733
I need it.

768

Put it back now, Martin.

769
00:44:36,307 --> 00:44:38,574

Martyring yourself to your pain

00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:12,274

00:45:19,617 --> 00:45:22,684
But he'll still win.

781
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,686
Anyways.

1
00:00:00,297 --> 00:00:02,297
Previously on "The Magicians"…

2
00:00:02,298 --> 00:00:04,135
I hesitated, but The Beast,
I should have…

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,617
- it's my fault.
- No, it's not.

4
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:09,190
It's Julia's fault.

5
00:00:09,225 --> 00:00:10,858
You know how to deal with gods.

6
00:00:10,893 --> 00:00:12,860
You know how to fuck up their shit.

7
00:00:12,895 --> 00:00:15,297
- Julia, no.
- I want to make a deal.

8
00:00:15,322 --> 00:00:18,061
No, guys, she… she's not sane.

9
00:00:18,086 --> 00:00:20,404
One small consolation is
the bitch is with The Beast

10
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:23,073
right now and I can't really see
that going her way.

11
00:00:23,108 --> 00:00:24,875
Word as bond.

12
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:27,390
I assume the extra bits
enchant the blade

13
00:00:27,446 --> 00:00:30,681
to kill me instantly
in the event I break it.

14
00:00:30,716 --> 00:00:32,082
You guys are from Brakebills?

15
00:00:32,118 --> 00:00:35,519
Dude, Josh Hoberman, class of '16.

16
00:00:35,554 --> 00:00:37,287
Come with me if you want to live.

17
00:00:37,323 --> 00:00:40,491
Yeah, Josh and Victoria
bailed, on one hand.

18
00:00:40,526 --> 00:00:43,460
On the other hand,
you can't really blame them.

19
00:00:43,496 --> 00:00:44,934
I'm Marina.

20
00:00:44,959 --> 00:00:47,965
- So you were…
- Top bitch in New York for starters.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,868
- Welcome back to Brakebills.
- Wait, you went here?

22
00:00:50,903 --> 00:00:53,003
Kicked out three months
before graduation.

23
00:00:53,038 --> 00:00:55,839
- Let's go steal their shit.
- So there's a bump.

24
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:58,175
Bigger than marrying
a total stranger-ette?

25
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:00,511
Once you get married,
you won't be able to be

26
00:01:00,546 --> 00:01:02,379
with anyone else, literally.

27
00:01:02,414 --> 00:01:04,982
But when I go back…

28
00:01:05,017 --> 00:01:07,184
I can never leave Fillory.

29
00:01:07,219 --> 00:01:10,487
Please fix my hands.

30
00:01:10,523 --> 00:01:13,190
See, how do I put this
in a way that you'll understand?

31
00:01:13,225 --> 00:01:15,692
Go fuck yourself.

32
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:18,061
According to the best
and only magic we have,

33
00:01:18,097 --> 00:01:20,564
The Beast will kill us, end of story.

34
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:22,699
Okay, zillion bucks
says The Beast comes back

35
00:01:22,735 --> 00:01:24,501
any minute, so what's the plan?

36
00:01:24,537 --> 00:01:27,671
We lost the blade,
so we need a new something,

37
00:01:27,706 --> 00:01:29,173
especially while Alice is still…

38
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:31,308
Watch your step…
wait, this is something.

39
00:01:31,343 --> 00:01:34,511
It's a workbook on spells, serious ones,

40
00:01:34,547 --> 00:01:36,013
but the actual spells aren't here.

41
00:01:36,048 --> 00:01:38,148
I know where we need to go.

42
00:01:38,184 --> 00:01:40,041
Brakebills?

43
00:01:56,535 --> 00:02:00,704
I don't get it. How come nobody
in a hood is trying to kill us?

44
00:02:06,812 --> 00:02:09,112
Okay, that's just weird.

45
00:02:09,148 --> 00:02:12,082
You want to stop and
figure it out, be my guest.

46
00:02:29,301 --> 00:02:31,568
You're alive.

47
00:02:31,604 --> 00:02:33,537
What a lovely surprise.

48
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:38,811
Okay, so…

49
00:02:39,006 --> 00:02:44,092
the castle armory was
basically empty, except for this.

50
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:46,617
This is a Brakebills student workbook.

51
00:02:46,652 --> 00:02:49,419
I'm not blind, Quentin, technically.

52
00:02:49,455 --> 00:02:52,422
From 1893, so I guess that
means that a Brakebills student

53
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:55,626
was in Fillory over a hundred years ago.

54
00:02:55,661 --> 00:02:58,128
And the only humans that had
access to the armory were…

55
00:02:58,163 --> 00:03:01,565
Own it, pumpkin. The Monarchy.

56
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,301
So we are not the first
Brakebills students

57
00:03:04,336 --> 00:03:06,470
to get into Fillory
or to assume the throne.

58
00:03:06,505 --> 00:03:08,772
It's a great question for history class,

59
00:03:08,807 --> 00:03:11,842
but if The Beast gets to
the Wellspring right now

60
00:03:11,877 --> 00:03:15,445
and sucks it bone-dry,
magic dies in Fillory.

61
00:03:15,481 --> 00:03:19,082
- It dies there…
- It dies here.

62
00:03:19,118 --> 00:03:21,818
On Earth.

63
00:03:21,854 --> 00:03:23,353
My God.

64
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:25,643
So the Battle Magic
that this student learned here,

65
00:03:25,668 --> 00:03:27,322
he learned from a professor named Bigby.

66
00:03:27,347 --> 00:03:29,593
- Have you heard of him?
- Her.

67
00:03:29,628 --> 00:03:33,050
Well, there is a note in here.

68
00:03:33,749 --> 00:03:35,665
There's a spell that seems strong enough

69
00:03:35,701 --> 00:03:37,400
called the Rhinemann Ultra…

70
00:03:37,436 --> 00:03:39,436
Right, but the spell
isn't actually here.

71
00:03:39,471 --> 00:03:41,304
Because why should anything be easy?

72
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,573
Shit. Shit! Duck!

73
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:45,642
- Who?
- Everybody!

74
00:03:49,348 --> 00:03:52,682
What the hell is that about?

75
00:03:52,718 --> 00:03:56,486
Uh, it's semi-not related
to any of this,

76
00:03:56,521 --> 00:03:58,989
but I think I know a temp fix.

77
00:03:59,024 --> 00:04:01,992
All right.

78
00:04:02,027 --> 00:04:03,093
I'll get back to you.

Okay, is that an actual song

87
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:36,893

You mind? I'm working.

93
00:04:55,947 --> 00:04:58,915
It's still too similar to the
first sigil that summoned him.

94
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,918
He'll know it's you. And a trap.

95
00:05:01,953 --> 00:05:03,920
You're welcome to have an actual idea.

96
00:05:03,955 --> 00:05:06,356
Oh, no, I'd ruin your primitive purity.

97
00:05:06,391 --> 00:05:07,857
That's part of what attracts him.

98
00:05:07,893 --> 00:05:09,859
You're an absolute savage, Julia.

99
00:05:09,895 --> 00:05:12,028
Look, I know you're basically
stoned on sugar,

100
00:05:12,064 --> 00:05:13,863
but if you could just
dial down the chipper…

101
00:05:15,033 --> 00:05:18,101
All I do is accept what you fight.

102
00:05:18,136 --> 00:05:19,969
Yeah.

103
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,524
- Which is?
- Life is pointless.

104
00:05:23,549 --> 00:05:25,508
The after-life even more so.

105
00:05:25,544 --> 00:05:27,430
Which is why we invent these games

106
00:05:27,455 --> 00:05:29,412
to fill the void of existence.

107
00:05:29,448 --> 00:05:32,182
Who diddled whom.
Who'll get revenge for it.

108
00:05:32,217 --> 00:05:34,017
Who takes the throne.

109
00:05:34,052 --> 00:05:37,253
Yeah, well, that would be me,
actually, and my friends.

110
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:39,122
Ah, well, I doubt
they're your friends anymore.

111
00:05:39,157 --> 00:05:43,226
And, uh, they won't be royals long. Huh.

112
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:45,095
Why?

113
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:48,455
Uh, maybe you could use a bit of help
with the Binding Principle.

114
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:51,034
Did you put some kind of curse
on the castle?

115
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:52,518
Did I?

116
00:05:53,672 --> 00:05:55,883
It was so long ago.

117
00:05:56,174 --> 00:05:58,001
I hardly remember.

118
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,566
The throne room, Sire.

119
00:06:13,492 --> 00:06:16,626
Can't be that hard to find dead rats.

120
00:06:19,874 --> 00:06:21,115
Wait, wait, wait, yes.

121
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,531
I-I believe I did work up
a little welcome.

122
00:06:24,656 --> 00:06:28,421
Yes, since Ember made it impossible
for me to retake the throne

123
00:06:28,573 --> 00:06:30,707
and the Children of Earth
kept coming and coming,

124
00:06:30,742 --> 00:06:34,244
drunk on self-love and power-lust.

125
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:38,081
Yes, I thought of it
as a kind of royal test…

126
00:06:38,116 --> 00:06:39,949
that no one ever passed.

127
00:06:41,453 --> 00:06:42,752
Sadly.

128
00:06:42,788 --> 00:06:44,354
What kind of test?

129
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:46,656
Ah, that's something
for each new despot to, uh,

130
00:06:46,692 --> 00:06:49,659
puzzle out themselves. Anyway.

131
00:06:49,695 --> 00:06:51,528
You're on the right track.

132
00:06:51,563 --> 00:06:54,931
Now we just need the bait.

133
00:06:54,966 --> 00:06:58,635
As soon as I'm finished
with this, I'm ready.

134
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,770
He knows you.

135
00:07:00,806 --> 00:07:03,106
A bit too intimately.

136
00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:06,609
No, I have the perfect fresh candidate.

137
00:07:06,645 --> 00:07:10,046
She's young, beautiful, female,
and a very powerful witch.

138
00:07:10,082 --> 00:07:12,015
No.

139
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,711
- Julia.
- Let's skip the discussion.

140
00:07:13,736 --> 00:07:16,040
You do as I say or this…

141
00:07:18,575 --> 00:07:20,296
does its job,

142
00:07:20,727 --> 00:07:21,974
per the bond.

143
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:24,232
Oh, well, technically,
the Leo Blade cuts my throat

144
00:07:24,257 --> 00:07:26,557
if I attempt to harm you, your beloveds,

145
00:07:26,582 --> 00:07:28,287
or undermine your efforts.

146
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,825

00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:16,569
Uh, wait, the cottage was here, right?

155
00:08:19,217 --> 00:08:22,418
It's not invisible, it's just… not.

156
00:08:22,454 --> 00:08:25,355
Oh, shit, right.

157
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:29,192
End of semester prank
to ditch the first-year losers.

158
00:08:29,227 --> 00:08:31,979
I should've remembered, it was my idea.

159
00:08:32,114 --> 00:08:33,557
Are you…

160
00:08:33,885 --> 00:08:35,581
I hate all of you.

161
00:08:35,676 --> 00:08:38,580
- I hate all of you.
- Could we just find the cottage, please.

162
00:08:45,143 --> 00:08:48,008
Mm, promising.

163
00:08:50,081 --> 00:08:52,816
To the first bottle
of Fillorian champagne.

164
00:08:52,851 --> 00:08:54,784
Which I know technically
isn't champagne.

165
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,835
Except I am renaming the Royal
Gardens "Champagne Nouveau."

166
00:08:59,547 --> 00:09:02,192
Mm. Ugh.

167
00:09:02,227 --> 00:09:05,728
"Champagne no-no." Jesus.

168
00:09:05,764 --> 00:09:09,866
That makes no sense. I used the
go-to fermenting enchantment.

169
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:12,234
No fretting. I'll get it right.
Trial and error.

170
00:09:13,772 --> 00:09:17,008
I'm your wife. I want to be obedient.

171
00:09:17,142 --> 00:09:20,477
Sit down.

172
00:09:20,512 --> 00:09:23,379
Nobody wants to be obedient.

173
00:09:23,415 --> 00:09:26,881
I do want to serve you and Fillory,

174
00:09:28,153 --> 00:09:30,053
but…

175
00:09:30,489 --> 00:09:32,428
But…?

176
00:09:33,859 --> 00:09:37,227
Look, I'm okay being a king,

177
00:09:37,262 --> 00:09:40,203
but I don't want to run a cult.

178
00:09:40,432 --> 00:09:43,015
If anyone has a right
to speak up, it's you.

179
00:09:44,836 --> 00:09:48,218
There hasn't been a truly inspiring,

180
00:09:48,243 --> 00:09:50,273
caring ruler since Rupert Chatwin,

181
00:09:50,308 --> 00:09:52,342
and that was so long ago,
most barely remember.

182
00:09:52,377 --> 00:09:54,310
Look, I'm cleaning the place up.

183
00:09:54,346 --> 00:09:57,280
I'm trying to get
some decent wine going.

184
00:09:57,315 --> 00:09:59,082
What else is there?

185
00:09:59,117 --> 00:10:01,317
The people are starving.

186
00:10:01,353 --> 00:10:03,286
Seriously?

187
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,770
Oh, okay.
We should probably get on that.

188
00:10:10,061 --> 00:10:13,696
And I'm guessing magic
probably won't do the trick.

189
00:10:13,732 --> 00:10:15,913
Magic is the problem.

190
00:10:17,068 --> 00:10:19,905
Oh, boy.

191
00:10:37,689 --> 00:10:41,958
Yep. We're alive. Deal.

192
00:10:42,003 --> 00:10:44,592
Can you keep your shit tight
for a few more minutes?

193
00:10:46,264 --> 00:10:48,498
Couple minutes is all I'll need.

194
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:50,667
Drink, now.

195
00:10:50,702 --> 00:10:53,803
You deserting, chicken-shit
motherfucker.

196
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,914
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

197
00:10:58,276 --> 00:11:01,744
- No, goddammit!
- Like Lando and Han. Right on.

198
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,781
Oh!

199
00:11:07,085 --> 00:11:09,434
Still got my legs.

200
00:11:10,422 --> 00:11:13,256
Uh, so it true what Josh was saying?

201
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:16,025
Fillory's real, right? Right?

202
00:11:16,061 --> 00:11:18,027
Fillory is very real.

203
00:11:18,063 --> 00:11:20,563
Okay.

204
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:24,267
And this is going to be
on the syllabus next semester?

205
00:11:24,302 --> 00:11:26,035
We shall see. But for now,

206
00:11:26,071 --> 00:11:29,606
Quentin, Alice, Penny,
and Margo need Battle Magic.

207
00:11:29,641 --> 00:11:32,442
We're going to teach Battle Magic now?

208
00:11:32,477 --> 00:11:34,277
It was once a required course.

209
00:11:34,312 --> 00:11:36,045
Till it was outlawed.

210
00:11:36,081 --> 00:11:37,614
For good reason, I hear.

211
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:42,452
Yes, well,
it was a very messy situation.

212
00:11:42,487 --> 00:11:45,021
At the time, I thought it was right,

213
00:11:45,056 --> 00:11:47,123
but the professor
who taught it disagreed.

214
00:11:47,158 --> 00:11:49,092
Strongly. She was fired,

215
00:11:49,127 --> 00:11:52,195
and as she was escorted
off campus, she said that…

216
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,210
I'm sorry, Henry, this is fascinating,

217
00:11:54,235 --> 00:11:56,933
but why are you telling me this?

218
00:11:56,968 --> 00:11:59,135
The professor, Bigby,

219
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:03,072
hinted that she hid
all the Battle Magic spells

220
00:12:03,108 --> 00:12:05,575
somewhere on campus.

221
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:08,771
"You'll need them someday," she said,

222
00:12:09,514 --> 00:12:11,537
"And me."

223
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,285
Again, why?

224
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,098
All the Battle Magic spells
are hidden in the library.

225
00:12:19,457 --> 00:12:23,012
No one knows the library
better than you.

226
00:12:26,031 --> 00:12:28,332
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

227
00:12:28,357 --> 00:12:31,458
We both are. Seriously sorry.

228
00:12:31,636 --> 00:12:33,569
- So where's Victoria?
- Traveling.

229
00:12:33,605 --> 00:12:35,638
I don't even know
if she's on this planet anymore.

230
00:12:35,674 --> 00:12:38,408
Can't blame her.

231
00:12:38,443 --> 00:12:40,410
- Spit in it.
- What is it?

232
00:12:40,445 --> 00:12:43,146
It's a hangover cure El and I
used when we got the shakes.

233
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:45,648
I amped it up with Nightshade
and a couple of Ativans.

234
00:12:45,684 --> 00:12:48,588
Might make you a little woozy,
but it could do the trick…

235
00:12:52,557 --> 00:12:56,492
Temporarily. So keep a stash on you.

236
00:12:56,528 --> 00:12:58,127
It is good to see you guys, though.

237
00:12:58,163 --> 00:13:00,442
- Fuck off.
- Okay.

238
00:13:14,012 --> 00:13:16,476
This one…

239
00:13:17,132 --> 00:13:20,350
is sheer, hellcat perfection.

240
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,566
I don't give a shit about getting him.

241
00:13:28,762 --> 00:13:31,422
- You should.
- Look, I didn't summon him.

242
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:33,622
I didn't get raped by him.

243
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:37,482
I have no skin in this except that
I want to kick your ass and kill him.

244
00:13:37,518 --> 00:13:40,185
♪ Fate may often treat me meanly ♪

245
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:45,013
♪ But I keenly pursue ♪

246
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:49,683
♪ A little mirage in the blue ♪

247
00:13:50,331 --> 00:13:52,652
Did you scrape him off
the cabaret floor?

248
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:54,499
Reynard is targeting Hedges.

249
00:13:54,535 --> 00:13:57,402
Right. So the answer is to
hire Michael Bublé to kidnap me

250
00:13:57,438 --> 00:13:59,237
and then use me as your bait.

251
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:01,239
If I'm wrong, raise your hand.

252
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:03,675
Look, you're right.
It was wrong grabbing you

253
00:14:03,711 --> 00:14:06,244
the way that we did,
but sooner or later,

254
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,691
he was gonna find you.

255
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:10,582
- We need someone…
- Else, Julia.

256
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:12,822
Or we have a problem.

257
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:15,150
Do you want a problem with me?

258
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:19,191
- Forget it.
- Great.

259
00:14:23,764 --> 00:14:25,931
I told you untying her was a mistake.

260
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:32,270
- Ow.
- What?

261
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:35,040
It's starting to burn a little.

262
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:36,441
Take it off.

263
00:14:36,477 --> 00:14:39,344
You know I can't. I need it.

264
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,314
The more it burns,
the less time we have.

265
00:14:44,418 --> 00:14:45,951
If it hurts, then…

266
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:48,920
Not everything that hurts is bad.

267
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:56,561
I hate that all of this is on you.

268
00:14:56,597 --> 00:15:00,198
You'd tell me if there was
something I could do.

269
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:02,552
Shift the weight off?

270
00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:07,005
Yeah, I'd tell you.

271
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:29,074
Look, she's a bitch on three wheels,

272
00:15:29,099 --> 00:15:32,207
probably bat-shit crazy,
but she's not wrong.

273
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:34,566
Did you find it?

274
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:37,069
I did. And?

275
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:38,737
Look, I know we made a pact.

276
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:41,073
I stick to my coast, you stick to yours.

277
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:43,075
But this might take
all the top Hedge bitches

278
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,444
to coven up and take this asshole out.

279
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:47,155
Your coast or mine?

280
00:15:47,548 --> 00:15:49,481
I'm already on my way.

281
00:15:55,022 --> 00:15:59,591
So, if I'm understanding this,
things here grow magically.

282
00:15:59,731 --> 00:16:01,426
Until recently, yes.

283
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:03,698
Everything always took care of itself.

284
00:16:03,877 --> 00:16:06,105
We used to grow all the nuts
in the southern region.

285
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:08,362
Until The Beast drained the magic.

286
00:16:08,502 --> 00:16:11,386
Now what's required is actual farm work.

287
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:15,138
Which no one in Fillory knows how to do.

288
00:16:17,878 --> 00:16:22,147
Ah, I think I'm getting
one of those migraines

289
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:25,071
where everything gets all bendy.

290
00:16:25,837 --> 00:16:27,493
Please God, let me pass out.

291
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:32,292
No? All right.

292
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,759
Fen?

293
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:39,531
I have a secret.

294
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:41,500
It's fairly difficult for me to confess.

295
00:16:41,535 --> 00:16:45,807
And it brings me nothing but
waves of aching nausea, but…

296
00:16:47,085 --> 00:16:48,416
I grew up…

297
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:50,842
on a farm.

298
00:16:50,992 --> 00:16:52,691
That's your secret?

299
00:16:52,716 --> 00:16:54,864
I spent years blocking it all out.

300
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,383
The smell of wet hay.

301
00:16:58,747 --> 00:17:01,586
And the feel of an udder.

302
00:17:01,622 --> 00:17:04,446
The taste of fresh…

303
00:17:04,892 --> 00:17:06,324
goat milk.

304
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,242
And the worst humans
in the known universe:

305
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,704
my family.

306
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:15,000
It's coming back
and if it all comes back,

307
00:17:15,025 --> 00:17:16,701
I'm pretty sure I'll know
exactly what to do.

308
00:17:16,737 --> 00:17:20,115
- That's wonderful.
- On a planet with no Zoloft.

309
00:17:20,274 --> 00:17:22,373
Now you sound like my king.

310
00:17:22,576 --> 00:17:24,142
Mm.

311
00:17:27,441 --> 00:17:30,282
So then, if I just needed
one little thing from you to…

312
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:33,043
to ease my agony?

313
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,897
- Anything.
- Mm.

314
00:17:34,922 --> 00:17:36,755
There's my girl.

315
00:17:38,818 --> 00:17:41,504
_

316
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:44,696
Professor Bigby was brilliant,
impatient, stubborn,

317
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:47,894
and mercurial. And a 500-year-old pixie.

318
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:50,902
Who more or less saw humans
as children to be toyed with.

319
00:17:51,389 --> 00:17:54,389
If she's as good as her word, and one
thing she certainly wasn't was a liar,

320
00:17:54,414 --> 00:17:57,409
then her book of Battle Magic
will be found here.

321
00:17:57,444 --> 00:17:59,744
- In this room.
- Why?

322
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,880
She told me. "The Battle Magic will be

323
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,582
"where the knowledge always is.

324
00:18:03,617 --> 00:18:05,797
"The day you need it, I promise,

325
00:18:05,953 --> 00:18:08,310
it will be your last hope."

326
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:11,246
Uh, those were
here exact words, "last hope."

327
00:18:11,271 --> 00:18:12,440
Yes.

328
00:18:12,465 --> 00:18:13,903
Well, that's the name of one

329
00:18:13,928 --> 00:18:15,627
of the more powerful texts
on Battle Magic.

330
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:17,199
"Last Hope Options."

331
00:18:17,224 --> 00:18:20,899
Yes, of course.
Pixies love puzzles and riddles.

332
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,160
Especially those
that make humans look stupid.

333
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,309
She gave me the title of the
book that we're searching for,

334
00:18:25,334 --> 00:18:28,306
but I'm afraid that it will be
very hard to find.

335
00:18:28,342 --> 00:18:29,474
Let's get to it.

336
00:18:31,645 --> 00:18:33,178
"Rhinemann."

337
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:39,284
"The Rhinemann Exchange."

338
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:42,429
A spy novel by Robert Ludlum.

339
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:44,125
What's next?

340
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:47,625
"Last Hope Options" is an anagram for…

341
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,506
"Pane Hotspot Silo"?

342
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,202
All right, let's try assigning

343
00:18:58,227 --> 00:18:59,504
a different number structure
to the letters.

344
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:03,008
For instance, A is 11, B is 22,
C is 44, and so on.

345
00:19:03,085 --> 00:19:05,443
- Okay.
- Ahem.

346
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:11,016
"Tat Loosens Hippo,"
"Opine Path Stools."

347
00:19:19,393 --> 00:19:21,326
Pixie puzzles.

348
00:19:41,417 --> 00:19:44,384
Penny, what's… what's happened
to your hands?

349
00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:46,151
What hasn't?

350
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:48,550
- Tell me.
- Why?

351
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:53,208
Maybe I can help.

352
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,036
- Nada.
- Ugh. Professor?

353
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:58,396
I can safely say
that none of the number codes

354
00:19:58,432 --> 00:20:00,365
we came up with led to anything.

355
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,934
We found about 300 anagram phrases.

356
00:20:03,027 --> 00:20:04,738
Anything promising?

357
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:07,672
Uh, well, uh,

358
00:20:07,777 --> 00:20:10,980
"Hospital Nose Top" mean anything?

359
00:20:11,111 --> 00:20:14,679
What about, uh, "Latte Shop Poison"?

360
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:17,962
No? Not surprising.

361
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:20,251
Uh, oh, this one's good.

362
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:23,121
This is my favorite because it's absurd.

363
00:20:23,156 --> 00:20:25,590
Uh, "Hotel Spa Potions."

364
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,355
Wait.

365
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:30,428
That's a book. In here.

366
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:44,442
- Yeah.
- "Last Hope Options."

367
00:20:44,478 --> 00:20:45,410
Ah.

368
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:53,502
The chapter's been ripped out.

369
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,536
Wait, there's a note.

370
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:57,419
"Hello, Henry.

371
00:20:57,657 --> 00:20:59,424
"If you're reading this, I was right

372
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:01,659
"and everyone else
at Brakebills was wrong.

373
00:21:01,695 --> 00:21:03,261
"How delightful.

374
00:21:03,427 --> 00:21:07,799
"It also means I'll see you
quick as one, two, nine.

375
00:21:07,943 --> 00:21:10,271
"Where middle leads and last is fine,

376
00:21:10,468 --> 00:21:12,513
"summer's here and ne'er retreats,

377
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:15,903
a pretty island made of streets."

378
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:18,209
Another riddle. Awesome.

379
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,707
Oh. Well, if it's, like,
where to find her?

380
00:21:21,732 --> 00:21:24,138
"Island made of streets"
is Rhode Island.

381
00:21:24,684 --> 00:21:27,528
What? Duh.

382
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,160
Sorry. Could you spell
your last name again?

383
00:21:37,371 --> 00:21:39,668
I would, but…

384
00:21:40,621 --> 00:21:42,500
you're asleep.

385
00:22:07,073 --> 00:22:08,721
You said anything.

386
00:22:08,814 --> 00:22:11,483
But this is… this is…

387
00:22:15,415 --> 00:22:17,584
Am I not enough for you?

388
00:22:19,552 --> 00:22:21,541
You're great.

389
00:22:21,788 --> 00:22:24,288
For… who you are.

390
00:22:24,324 --> 00:22:27,885
It's just… I already told you.
My life was different before.

391
00:22:28,061 --> 00:22:29,227
Yeah.

392
00:22:29,392 --> 00:22:32,118
And I'll help you make a new life.

393
00:22:33,233 --> 00:22:35,912
Well, this is new.

394
00:22:35,984 --> 00:22:38,373
And right inside the lines of marriage.

395
00:22:38,538 --> 00:22:41,154
We just do what we do in bed,

396
00:22:41,341 --> 00:22:44,424
and they do what they do.

397
00:22:44,577 --> 00:22:46,544
I only picked people
already doing each other.

398
00:22:46,569 --> 00:22:48,503
And we get to watch.

399
00:22:52,052 --> 00:22:53,351
You guys are all cool with this, right?

400
00:22:53,386 --> 00:22:55,974
- Mm-hmm.
See?

401
00:22:57,357 --> 00:22:59,057
You're their king.

402
00:22:59,092 --> 00:23:01,291
They will do as you wish,
no matter how…

403
00:23:01,316 --> 00:23:03,594
- Fun.
- Debased.

404
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:05,285
Debased?

405
00:23:05,432 --> 00:23:08,918
Honey-love, I've been doing
this shit since I was 12,

406
00:23:09,069 --> 00:23:11,348
except on a computer.

407
00:23:11,538 --> 00:23:13,247
I don't know what that means,

408
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,130
but…

409
00:23:15,923 --> 00:23:18,333
if it's what you desire…

410
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,408
All right. Good night, everyone. Thanks.

411
00:23:25,526 --> 00:23:27,414
You all look really good naked.

412
00:23:27,415 --> 00:23:29,283
- Thank you, Sire.
- Your Majesty.

413
00:23:38,264 --> 00:23:42,033
Well, I guess life
is about new experiences,

414
00:23:42,097 --> 00:23:44,081
and, uh, I've never been
pussy-whipped, so…

415
00:23:51,077 --> 00:23:52,507
You're doomed.

416
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,312
Which I might find amusing
except it's likely

417
00:23:56,337 --> 00:23:58,390
to get me killed.

418
00:23:58,651 --> 00:24:00,835
And for what?

419
00:24:01,087 --> 00:24:03,809
Because no matter what,
I'm going to hold on to my…

420
00:24:03,834 --> 00:24:05,645
If you say "humanity"
you'll learn I can vomit

421
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,603
non-stop for two hours.

422
00:24:11,664 --> 00:24:14,195
You know, I'm about to make
an enemy of a god

423
00:24:14,334 --> 00:24:17,125
who I have no quarrel with.

424
00:24:17,403 --> 00:24:19,370
And without decent bait,
you're literally asking me

425
00:24:19,395 --> 00:24:23,320
to do it blindfolded, shackled,
and hopping on one leg.

426
00:24:25,132 --> 00:24:28,734
If… if I took just a smidgen
of your Shade,

427
00:24:28,828 --> 00:24:32,351
not only would your trauma drop away,

428
00:24:33,019 --> 00:24:35,618
you'd have no issue with using Marina.

429
00:24:35,755 --> 00:24:38,523
You'd be free of these useless feelings

430
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:41,110
and this idiotic moral quagmire.

431
00:24:41,327 --> 00:24:43,661
Come near me
and the knife won't kill you.

432
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:46,021
'Cause you can still live
without a dick.

433
00:24:51,247 --> 00:24:53,568
♪ Life is very rough and tumble ♪

434
00:24:53,685 --> 00:24:55,540
Or a tongue.

435
00:25:03,783 --> 00:25:06,649
So Rhode Island
was just beginner's luck.

436
00:25:07,587 --> 00:25:11,743
Okay, uh, okay, "Summer's here
and ne'er retreats."

437
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:16,495
So "ne'er retreats," it's, uh,
it's set. "Summer is set."

438
00:25:16,763 --> 00:25:19,089
"Somer… Somerset. Somerset."

439
00:25:19,114 --> 00:25:20,284
Somerset.

440
00:25:20,309 --> 00:25:21,714
And the numbers could be
a street address.

441
00:25:21,739 --> 00:25:23,538
Right.

442
00:25:23,736 --> 00:25:27,335
"Quick as one, two, nine.
Middle is first, last is fine."

443
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:32,113
219. So it's 219 something Somerset.

444
00:25:43,723 --> 00:25:46,657
Oh, come on.

445
00:25:55,435 --> 00:25:57,421
I think I can help.

446
00:26:01,824 --> 00:26:03,152
- Sorry, sir.
- Yes?

447
00:26:03,177 --> 00:26:05,110
We've had a security breach.

448
00:26:15,056 --> 00:26:16,658
Marina.

449
00:26:16,822 --> 00:26:18,967
Please.

450
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,396
I need asylum.

451
00:26:27,116 --> 00:26:29,132
Marina.

452
00:26:29,452 --> 00:26:32,593
What else can you tell me about this…

453
00:26:32,848 --> 00:26:34,624
situation?

454
00:26:43,966 --> 00:26:47,247
Well, for starters,
it's not a "situation."

455
00:26:47,437 --> 00:26:49,437
It's a raping, killing, omniscient god

456
00:26:49,462 --> 00:26:52,886
with a pretty specific type:
me and mine.

457
00:26:53,743 --> 00:26:55,376
What the fuck else do you need to know?

458
00:26:55,411 --> 00:26:58,245
I see you still don't
expend much on good manners.

459
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,547
What, this is a charm school now?

460
00:26:59,582 --> 00:27:02,239
No, but it is my school.

461
00:27:02,418 --> 00:27:04,184
Not a safe house.

462
00:27:04,454 --> 00:27:06,645
I was the best student
you ever had here.

463
00:27:06,789 --> 00:27:08,265
You said that.

464
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:10,735
I confused talent with character.

465
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,794
You need both
to be a true magician, Marina.

466
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,985
Kicking you out wasn't a choice.

467
00:27:16,132 --> 00:27:18,074
I couldn't have you
infecting my students then

468
00:27:18,099 --> 00:27:20,233
and I certainly won't now.

469
00:27:27,844 --> 00:27:30,230
You fucking prick.

470
00:27:32,315 --> 00:27:34,994
- Where am I supposed to go?
- You can keep your memories.

471
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:38,285
I hope that whatever you've
learned here will help keep you safe.

472
00:27:38,431 --> 00:27:40,621
What I learned here will get me killed.

473
00:27:57,306 --> 00:28:00,256
Remember, pixies are tricky.

474
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:03,310
Keep all questions and answers
short and to the point.

475
00:28:03,346 --> 00:28:05,084
- You understand?
- Henry.

476
00:28:05,181 --> 00:28:07,951
- Ah, yes.
- Henry, you look awful.

477
00:28:08,117 --> 00:28:09,850
What happened to your eyes?
Are you blind?

478
00:28:09,886 --> 00:28:12,436
And your… your hair.
Henry, you look ancient.

479
00:28:12,461 --> 00:28:14,188
Very nice of you to say so, dear.

480
00:28:14,223 --> 00:28:15,641
Oh, no wonder you sought me out.

481
00:28:15,666 --> 00:28:19,225
I mean, you've been
positively mauled by something.

482
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,698
Bigby, let me intro…

483
00:28:21,469 --> 00:28:24,026
Mmm.

484
00:28:24,575 --> 00:28:26,378
Some things haven't changed.

485
00:28:26,403 --> 00:28:30,208
You still are the most wonderful kisser.

486
00:28:30,572 --> 00:28:31,939
Do you have time to go to bed with me?

487
00:28:31,974 --> 00:28:34,875
We are a bit on the clock, darling.

488
00:28:34,911 --> 00:28:36,756
And these are my students.

489
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:38,340
They are in need of the Rhinemann Ultra.

490
00:28:38,365 --> 00:28:39,840
- Are they now?
- Oh, yes.

491
00:28:39,865 --> 00:28:41,949
Well, if the stuffed shirts
and ninny nay-sayers

492
00:28:41,984 --> 00:28:44,351
hadn't outlawed Battle Magic
38 years ago,

493
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,621
then they would have it,
which you well know, Henry.

494
00:28:50,593 --> 00:28:52,593
You look hungry.

495
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:56,397
So why was Battle Magic outlawed?

496
00:28:56,465 --> 00:29:00,475
Humans least attractive qualities.

497
00:29:00,903 --> 00:29:03,874
Panic and paranoia.

498
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,973
And there were several student
deaths that semester.

499
00:29:07,109 --> 00:29:09,620
Far fewer than the 1870s,

500
00:29:09,645 --> 00:29:11,941
or the 1920s, or the '60s.

501
00:29:12,348 --> 00:29:14,949
Another human failing, short memory.

502
00:29:17,753 --> 00:29:19,377
Hmm.

503
00:29:19,855 --> 00:29:22,752
You'd be the one casting. Good.

504
00:29:22,925 --> 00:29:25,619
It would burn anyone else to a crisp.

505
00:29:26,596 --> 00:29:29,958
I can feel your power. It's almost…

506
00:29:30,233 --> 00:29:33,769
it's almost god-like.

507
00:29:33,794 --> 00:29:35,167
Did you fuck one of them?

508
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:37,438
I mean, they are wonderful, aren't they?

509
00:29:37,473 --> 00:29:38,706
At least mine was.

510
00:29:38,741 --> 00:29:41,683
I glowed for weeks. No, literally.

511
00:29:41,708 --> 00:29:43,611
I actually got mine
a little differently.

512
00:29:43,646 --> 00:29:46,413
Yes, and it's waning. Quite quickly.

513
00:29:46,536 --> 00:29:48,916
And so, Bigby, if you could
just please give us the spell.

514
00:29:48,951 --> 00:29:51,934
I don't give anything, Henry.
You of all people know that.

515
00:29:52,817 --> 00:29:54,519
So…

516
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:57,112
well, convince me.

517
00:29:59,161 --> 00:30:02,263
Where the hell is the Burnt River?

518
00:30:04,567 --> 00:30:08,725
Apologies for last night, dear wife.

519
00:30:08,878 --> 00:30:11,669
None required, my lord.

520
00:30:11,907 --> 00:30:15,396
I will need to find some way
to blow off steam.

521
00:30:15,489 --> 00:30:17,978
Somehow, someday. But in the meantime,

522
00:30:18,014 --> 00:30:21,826
I get to stroll
the wondrous memory fields

523
00:30:21,851 --> 00:30:24,185
of my agrarian childhood…

524
00:30:24,647 --> 00:30:27,069
sprinkling shit.

525
00:30:28,457 --> 00:30:30,631
Sprinkling… shit?

526
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:33,394
Shoveling, mixing, drying, hauling.

527
00:30:33,429 --> 00:30:34,895
Sorry.

528
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:37,624
Sprinkling it on… what?

529
00:30:38,352 --> 00:30:40,552
Crops.

530
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:42,519
Oh.

531
00:30:42,838 --> 00:30:45,042
Fertilizer?

532
00:30:46,765 --> 00:30:49,710
Your farmers don't fertilize?

533
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,092
So it's the only thing we've
found that might stop The Beast.

534
00:30:57,117 --> 00:30:59,131
I mean, it was amazing reading about how

535
00:30:59,156 --> 00:31:01,951
you used the Rhinemann at Gettysburg
to help win the war for the Union.

536
00:31:01,976 --> 00:31:04,646
Right. And it was you
who slipped it to Rupert Chatwin

537
00:31:04,664 --> 00:31:06,397
for the Battle of the Bulge.

538
00:31:06,433 --> 00:31:07,832
I mean, you changed history.

539
00:31:07,857 --> 00:31:10,434
Oh, I did, yes. Many times.

540
00:31:11,671 --> 00:31:15,278
Henry, is that juniper tree still there?

541
00:31:15,442 --> 00:31:17,800
You know, the one by the infirmary.

542
00:31:18,011 --> 00:31:22,280
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, it has the softest grass.

543
00:31:22,315 --> 00:31:24,573
It feels delicious on your ass.

544
00:31:24,684 --> 00:31:26,417
I mean, we used to sneak out
at night and,

545
00:31:26,453 --> 00:31:29,650
- oh, for hours we would…
- Bigby, please.

546
00:31:29,675 --> 00:31:32,190
Are you telling me you don't
even remember that tree?

547
00:31:32,225 --> 00:31:34,926
Of course I do, darling. Of course.

548
00:31:34,961 --> 00:31:36,794
But it's private.

549
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,789
Well, not anymore.

550
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:41,086
Plus, these two fuck like jackrabbits.

551
00:31:41,111 --> 00:31:42,774
I mean, you can just smell it.

552
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:45,436
- Ahem.
- And it is delicious, darling.

553
00:31:45,472 --> 00:31:47,776
Bigby, we really are in a time crunch.

554
00:31:47,801 --> 00:31:48,987
- Mm-hmm.
- There's a lot at stake.

555
00:31:49,012 --> 00:31:51,876
Which I told you
would be the case someday, hmm.

556
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:54,620
Well, welcome to someday.

557
00:32:10,827 --> 00:32:14,471
No one but you can be
within 20 feet of the blast.

558
00:32:15,402 --> 00:32:18,449
It will kill anyone,
including your Beast.

559
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:21,831
As strong as he is, you're stronger.

560
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,712
But not for long. Hmm?

561
00:32:27,854 --> 00:32:30,963
So, stop prattling and get to it.

562
00:32:34,322 --> 00:32:37,706
Boys, the shit.

563
00:32:38,393 --> 00:32:41,192
Um, Sire, I do not wish
to appear ungrateful…

564
00:32:41,217 --> 00:32:44,063
You're just going to have
to trust your king on this one.

565
00:32:53,177 --> 00:32:57,726
Come on, lads. Many a farm to grace…

566
00:32:57,953 --> 00:33:01,218
with… our royal dung.

567
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:04,960
Yah! Come on!

568
00:33:18,345 --> 00:33:19,541
Ow.

569
00:33:20,525 --> 00:33:22,058
Shit.

570
00:33:22,203 --> 00:33:25,859
The time is 10:58 p.m.

571
00:33:27,942 --> 00:33:31,127
Alice, you're getting it, but…

572
00:33:31,221 --> 00:33:33,012
It's taking too long.

573
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:35,515
I'm not as strong as I was.

574
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,111
By the time I'm fully powered up,

575
00:33:37,136 --> 00:33:38,877
The Beast will have eaten
all of our faces off.

576
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,288
You all are going to need
something strong to hit him with.

577
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:44,557
Bigby isn't the only one

578
00:33:44,769 --> 00:33:47,386
who tucked away a few secrets.

579
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,800
- Ah, ow!
- Sorry.

580
00:33:53,835 --> 00:33:56,308
The spell says it has to be tight.

581
00:33:56,905 --> 00:33:59,739
Do they have to be behind me?
I feel like I'm getting busted.

582
00:33:59,845 --> 00:34:02,475
You can't look at your hands
for 12 hours.

583
00:34:04,946 --> 00:34:06,413
Okay, whoa, what is that?

584
00:34:06,438 --> 00:34:08,407
I can't pronounce the name.

585
00:34:08,683 --> 00:34:10,216
It's from China.

586
00:34:10,343 --> 00:34:12,375
It'll keep the blood circulating,

587
00:34:12,587 --> 00:34:15,945
but take away a lot of the discomfort.

588
00:34:16,391 --> 00:34:18,898
Wait, that feels… ah!

589
00:34:21,817 --> 00:34:24,747
O… kay.

590
00:34:26,568 --> 00:34:30,330
I'm wondering if maybe you could
rub a little into my shoulder.

591
00:34:32,373 --> 00:34:34,635
Yeah, I got a cramp.

592
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:36,634
Which one?

593
00:34:36,978 --> 00:34:39,173
Both, actually.

594
00:35:14,015 --> 00:35:16,091
I feel guilty.

595
00:35:17,285 --> 00:35:19,118
Why?

596
00:35:19,289 --> 00:35:21,672
Letting you do all the work.

597
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:26,164
I don't mind.

598
00:35:26,422 --> 00:35:30,537
Still, if there's anything
I can do for you, let me know.

599
00:35:30,798 --> 00:35:34,334
I don't think you're in
a position to do much.

600
00:35:35,203 --> 00:35:36,920
Try me.

601
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:40,174
I might.

602
00:35:41,476 --> 00:35:42,972
After you graduate.

603
00:35:54,822 --> 00:35:57,673
- Jules.
- Q, hey.

604
00:35:57,814 --> 00:35:59,747
Hey.

605
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:04,038
Hey, um…

606
00:36:04,226 --> 00:36:07,726
I-I got your message in my
bathroom mirror. It was freaky.

607
00:36:08,169 --> 00:36:11,804
Look, um, I'm not supposed to tell
you what I'm gonna tell you.

608
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,606
Okay, fine. Don't.

609
00:36:13,641 --> 00:36:15,878
I just… I-I have to warn you.

610
00:36:17,278 --> 00:36:19,178
You could die if you don't
get clear of The Beast.

611
00:36:19,213 --> 00:36:20,913
You think I don't know
how dangerous he is?

612
00:36:20,948 --> 00:36:24,083
No, not him. Us.
We're going to kill him.

613
00:36:24,118 --> 00:36:26,485
Do what you want with him
but not until I get Reynard.

614
00:36:26,521 --> 00:36:28,994
No, we can't wait.

615
00:36:29,323 --> 00:36:31,557
- You won't…
- No, Jules, we can't.

616
00:36:31,592 --> 00:36:33,859
I-I know that you're hurting. I just…

617
00:36:33,895 --> 00:36:36,662
I-I need you to see
that this is bigger than you.

618
00:36:36,697 --> 00:36:38,731
The Beast,
he's killing magic everywhere.

619
00:36:38,766 --> 00:36:40,402
And Reynard is killing
people everywhere.

620
00:36:40,427 --> 00:36:41,685
Do you think that that's less important?

621
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:44,838
No, I just think that what
you want here is revenge and…

622
00:36:44,863 --> 00:36:46,624
And you don't?

623
00:36:49,054 --> 00:36:52,355
Just don't be within
20 feet of The Beast

624
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,879
when we make our move, okay?

625
00:36:53,904 --> 00:36:57,843
Do it before I get Reynard,
you better not be within 20 miles of me.

626
00:37:00,721 --> 00:37:02,698
I came here to warn you
and you're threatening me.

627
00:37:07,728 --> 00:37:10,144
Look, I did what I had to do. I…

628
00:37:10,298 --> 00:37:12,363
make up your own mind.

629
00:37:13,133 --> 00:37:15,348
There's something.

630
00:37:16,293 --> 00:37:19,471
About the castle.
He… he made some kind of joke.

631
00:37:19,507 --> 00:37:21,040
He put a curse on it.

632
00:37:21,075 --> 00:37:22,918
Anyone who assumes the throne.

633
00:37:23,077 --> 00:37:25,156
What kind of curse?

634
00:37:25,947 --> 00:37:27,726
He wouldn't say.

635
00:37:27,982 --> 00:37:29,523
But I'm pretty sure it's no joke.

636
00:37:29,617 --> 00:37:31,585
Okay, vague.

637
00:37:32,486 --> 00:37:34,407
Mildly helpful, I guess.

638
00:37:34,655 --> 00:37:36,641
It's all I got.

639
00:37:37,959 --> 00:37:39,633
Thank you.

640
00:37:41,796 --> 00:37:43,629
Sure.

641
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,598
This is…

642
00:37:48,169 --> 00:37:50,102
I know.

643
00:37:52,206 --> 00:37:55,140
Okay, I'll see you when I see you.

644
00:37:58,879 --> 00:38:00,452
See you.

645
00:38:55,251 --> 00:38:57,485
Wow.

646
00:38:58,666 --> 00:39:00,228
I owe you for real.

647
00:39:11,089 --> 00:39:14,932
Good. Now this is going
to take just a few minutes

648
00:39:14,957 --> 00:39:16,423
to fully power up.

649
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:18,537
You all are going to need
something strong

650
00:39:18,694 --> 00:39:20,467
to hold off The Beast.

651
00:39:20,696 --> 00:39:22,577
Step one…

652
00:39:22,831 --> 00:39:25,092
is for all of you

653
00:39:25,117 --> 00:39:29,330
to get very, very drunk.

654
00:39:29,638 --> 00:39:32,036
- Why?
- You'll see.

655
00:39:32,207 --> 00:39:34,348
Chug-a-lug.

656
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:38,011
As you grow, your name will become
an important part of you.

657
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:41,415
Even the shape of the letters
will connect with your will,

658
00:39:41,532 --> 00:39:43,499
your unique abilities.

659
00:39:47,923 --> 00:39:51,017
Well, I can never get buried
in a Jewish cemetery.

660
00:39:51,226 --> 00:39:55,187
- Are you even Jewish?
- No, but options.

661
00:39:55,212 --> 00:39:58,080
How much do I have to drink
so that I never have to hear

662
00:39:58,105 --> 00:40:00,233
- your voice again?
- Good.

663
00:40:00,258 --> 00:40:02,425
Now for the painful part.

664
00:40:02,471 --> 00:40:04,214
That wasn't the painful part?

665
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:07,350
Oh, no. Professor Li?

666
00:40:28,662 --> 00:40:31,460
This is a Cacodemon.

667
00:40:31,866 --> 00:40:33,733
- Jesus.
- They'll grow much bigger.

668
00:40:33,819 --> 00:40:37,270
Unleash these and believe me,
they'll keep The Beast plenty busy.

669
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:41,429
Each of you will be given a special word
to command your Cacodemon to attack.

670
00:40:41,652 --> 00:40:43,618
They're a one-shot weapon,

671
00:40:43,643 --> 00:40:45,476
so pick your moment with care.

672
00:40:45,647 --> 00:40:48,435
What are you, uh, gonna do with it?

673
00:40:49,117 --> 00:40:51,885
Lift your shirt, Quentin,
and turn around.

674
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,286
Oh.

675
00:40:53,428 --> 00:40:55,756
Those words never led to anything good.

676
00:40:55,924 --> 00:40:58,272
Well, almost never.

677
00:41:13,401 --> 00:41:15,368
Right, next.

678
00:41:20,249 --> 00:41:23,560
Sire, it's working.

679
00:41:23,683 --> 00:41:25,404
Oh, great.

680
00:41:25,731 --> 00:41:28,732
- Mm, thank you.
- Thank you, my King.

681
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:32,292
No, no. Thank the hell
that was my childhood.

682
00:41:37,432 --> 00:41:39,318
Oh, well,

683
00:41:39,501 --> 00:41:42,185
perfect timing, for once.

684
00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:51,516
Your High King has agricultural
tales to tell.

685
00:41:51,947 --> 00:41:54,812
I give you the reign of…

686
00:41:55,384 --> 00:41:57,002
King Shit.

687
00:42:01,288 --> 00:42:04,495

be dead without me, so…

1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:01,808
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"…</i>

2
00:00:04,156 --> 00:00:06,101
Zillion bucks says The
Beast comes back any minute,

3
00:00:06,125 --> 00:00:07,257
so what's the plan?

4
00:00:07,292 --> 00:00:08,425
<i>Okay, so here's the thing.</i>

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,826
<i>I can't really touch the knife.</i>

6
00:00:09,862 --> 00:00:11,228
<i>We need the power of a god.</i>

7
00:00:11,263 --> 00:00:14,464
I have gifted you my
Bestowal. Imbibe it.

8
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,967
The more it burns,
the less time we have.

9
00:00:17,002 --> 00:00:18,735
There's a spell that
seems strong enough.

10
00:00:18,771 --> 00:00:19,970
These are my students.

11
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:21,738
They are in need of the Rhinemann Ultra.

12
00:00:21,774 --> 00:00:25,409
<i>No one but you can be
within 20 feet of the blast.</i>

13
00:00:25,444 --> 00:00:27,477
<i>Alice is going to take
just a few minutes</i>

14
00:00:27,513 --> 00:00:28,645
<i>to fully power up.</i>

15
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,313
This is a cacodemon.

16
00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:31,349
It'll grow much bigger.

17
00:00:31,383 --> 00:00:32,816
Unleash these, and believe me,

18
00:00:32,851 --> 00:00:34,718
they'll keep The Beast plenty busy.

19
00:00:36,054 --> 00:00:38,321
- Do you know what a Niffin is?
- No.

20
00:00:38,357 --> 00:00:41,091
<i>It's when too much runs through you.</i>

21
00:00:41,126 --> 00:00:43,260
<i>Only the magic is left.</i>

22
00:00:43,295 --> 00:00:45,462
<i>Please… fix…</i>

23
00:00:45,497 --> 00:00:46,596
my hands.

24
00:00:46,632 --> 00:00:48,932
<i>Go… fuck… yourself?</i>

25
00:00:48,967 --> 00:00:50,267
I think I can help.

26
00:00:50,302 --> 00:00:52,536
- Wow.
- I owe you for real.

27
00:00:52,571 --> 00:00:54,449
You could die if you don't
get clear of The Beast.

28
00:00:54,473 --> 00:00:56,273
You think I don't know
how dangerous he is?

29
00:00:56,308 --> 00:00:58,041
No. Not him. Us.

30
00:00:58,076 --> 00:00:59,543
Yeah, do what you want with him,

31
00:00:59,578 --> 00:01:00,688
but not until I get Reynard.

32
00:01:00,712 --> 00:01:01,978
We can't merely summon him.

33
00:01:02,014 --> 00:01:03,814
A god can resist.

34
00:01:03,849 --> 00:01:05,549
I don't give a shit about getting him.

35
00:01:05,584 --> 00:01:07,384
- You should.
- I didn't summon him.

36
00:01:07,419 --> 00:01:09,119
<i>I didn't get raped by him.</i>

37
00:01:09,154 --> 00:01:10,187
I have no skin in this.

38
00:01:10,222 --> 00:01:11,721
Reynard is targeting hedges.

39
00:01:15,093 --> 00:01:17,327
Did you put some kind
of curse on the castle?

40
00:01:17,362 --> 00:01:18,562
Did I?

41
00:01:19,865 --> 00:01:21,832
The spell that won World War II

42
00:01:21,867 --> 00:01:23,967
is called the Rhinemann Ultra?

43
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:25,735
Sounds like a not-so-great beer.

44
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:27,649
Fine, it's a beer, but
it's a beer that we can use

45
00:01:27,673 --> 00:01:29,517
- to kill The Beast.
- Meanwhile, Penny comes back

46
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:31,675
with cool circa-1985 wrist chains.

47
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,656
Yeah, super cool how they
keep me from killing myself.

48
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,758
And then Dean Fogg gives you
all matching tramp stamps?

49
00:01:35,781 --> 00:01:37,147
I thought tramp stamps

50
00:01:37,182 --> 00:01:38,849
were supposed to be on our lower back?

51
00:01:38,884 --> 00:01:40,762
God, I feel like I missed
out on some crazy party

52
00:01:40,786 --> 00:01:42,764
you'll be talking about
for the rest of your lives.

53
00:01:42,788 --> 00:01:45,255
Say what you want, but we
brought back weapons and a plan.

54
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,190
What do you have to show for yourself?

55
00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:56,233
Ta… fucking… da.

56
00:01:57,369 --> 00:01:59,603
Your royal accoutrement.

57
00:01:59,638 --> 00:02:02,539
<i>This</i> is ceremony, people,

58
00:02:02,574 --> 00:02:05,842
and I expect you to
slather yourselves in it.

59
00:02:05,878 --> 00:02:06,843
Thank you, Eliot.

60
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:09,513
I missed you all.

61
00:02:09,548 --> 00:02:10,914
And I was bored.

62
00:02:11,394 --> 00:02:12,749
Come. Sit.

63
00:02:12,784 --> 00:02:14,751
Wait, is this really
the most important thing

64
00:02:14,786 --> 00:02:16,119
we could be doing right now?

65
00:02:16,154 --> 00:02:19,105
I mean, The Beast is still out there
waiting for us…

66
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,660
The Beast can wait for five minutes.

67
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:23,426
You are all Kings and Queens of Fillory.

68
00:02:23,613 --> 00:02:25,228
Well, almost all of you.

69
00:02:25,355 --> 00:02:29,799
Just revel in your majesty
for one fucking second.

70
00:02:30,175 --> 00:02:32,285
Be regal, miscreants.

71
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:37,340
Mm.

72
00:02:38,847 --> 00:02:41,044
You're such a stupid, stupid, man.

73
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,612
I'm gonna kill you in your sleep.

74
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,651
El… El… El, you okay?

75
00:02:47,686 --> 00:02:49,753
Totally fine, why?

76
00:02:49,788 --> 00:02:50,887
It's just…

77
00:02:50,923 --> 00:02:52,166
you went away there for a minute.

78
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,391
Nonsense. I feel great.

79
00:02:54,862 --> 00:02:55,992
Have a seat.

80
00:02:56,299 --> 00:02:58,295
I'm kind of on a clock here,

81
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,230
so we should talk strategy.

82
00:03:00,265 --> 00:03:01,309
Yeah, we already talked strategy,

83
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,666
so we just need to catch you up.

84
00:03:02,701 --> 00:03:03,778
You've been planning without me?

85
00:03:03,802 --> 00:03:05,335
Yeah… when we were on Earth.

86
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,690
What did you think we were doing?

87
00:03:12,344 --> 00:03:13,821
Eliot, we're not trying to exclude you.

88
00:03:13,845 --> 00:03:15,512
You just weren't there.

89
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:18,009
No. No, I wasn't, was I?

90
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:21,184
Don't think I don't see how this works.

91
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:23,212
You disappear. You come back.

92
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:26,423
Matching tattoos, and now
you're three against one.

93
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,458
I know exactly what you're planning.

94
00:03:28,493 --> 00:03:30,515
- Don't touch me.
- Sweetie?

95
00:03:31,218 --> 00:03:33,263
You kind of sound insane.

96
00:03:33,298 --> 00:03:34,484
Do I?

97
00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:40,937
Because I promise you…
I will not go down easily.

98
00:03:40,973 --> 00:03:42,570
Oo-surpers.

99
00:03:44,836 --> 00:03:47,177
Usurpers.

100
00:03:47,336 --> 00:03:49,813
Whichever way you're
supposed to pronounce it.

101
00:03:49,848 --> 00:03:51,047
What just happened?

102
00:03:51,383 --> 00:03:53,539
He got like this on shrooms once.

103
00:03:53,938 --> 00:03:55,685
I'll go talk to him.

104
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,628
<i>I just remembered
something that Julia said,</i>

105
00:04:04,663 --> 00:04:06,201
and it's starting to
make a lot of sense.

106
00:04:06,225 --> 00:04:07,897
- You talked to that bitch?
- Yes, he did.

107
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:10,133
It was a warning.
Something The Beast said.

108
00:04:10,168 --> 00:04:13,169
Uh… God, of course. It makes sense.

109
00:04:13,205 --> 00:04:15,080
I mean, he'd want to
booby-trap his kingdom, right?

110
00:04:15,104 --> 00:04:19,009
So apparently, he left curses behind.

111
00:04:19,463 --> 00:04:21,211
Here, actually.

112
00:04:21,463 --> 00:04:23,413
So you think Eliot might be cursed?

113
00:04:23,448 --> 00:04:25,215
I mean, she was vague, but I mean…

114
00:04:27,455 --> 00:04:28,518
Did either of you notice

115
00:04:28,553 --> 00:04:30,387
that Eliot started acting strangely

116
00:04:30,422 --> 00:04:32,713
once he took a drink from the goblet?

117
00:04:33,651 --> 00:04:37,794
I mean, it could be poison or a potion.

118
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:43,533
All right, well, we probably shouldn't
drink from ours just to be safe.

119
00:04:43,568 --> 00:04:44,779
Or maybe it was just some primo

120
00:04:44,803 --> 00:04:46,247
Fillorian shit that went up his nose,

121
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:47,963
and he's on the bad end of a trip

122
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:49,627
because he's him.

123
00:04:52,049 --> 00:04:53,276
Did something happen to you?

124
00:04:53,311 --> 00:04:55,111
Nope. Nothing.

125
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:57,666
I'm fine… Penny.

126
00:05:03,424 --> 00:05:06,089
Wait. And now you're doing it.

127
00:05:06,124 --> 00:05:07,514
I don't know what you're talking about.

128
00:05:07,538 --> 00:05:08,792
I mean like Eliot.

129
00:05:08,827 --> 00:05:10,406
You're acting all tweaky and shit.

130
00:05:10,438 --> 00:05:11,844
We're fine.

131
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:13,763
Clearly.

132
00:05:14,094 --> 00:05:16,875
Look, I think we can all agree
that we have a problem here.

133
00:05:17,258 --> 00:05:18,352
Eliot.

134
00:05:19,149 --> 00:05:22,405
He's High King. He's cursed.

135
00:05:22,535 --> 00:05:25,642
- We have no choice but…
- We have to kill him.

136
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:27,210
Exactly.

137
00:05:27,738 --> 00:05:28,973
The thrones.

138
00:05:30,145 --> 00:05:31,567
They're both cursed.

139
00:05:31,692 --> 00:05:34,718
This is hard for you. I get that.

140
00:05:34,753 --> 00:05:36,219
It's hard for us too.

141
00:05:36,254 --> 00:05:37,635
But it must be done.

142
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,010
For Fillory.

143
00:05:48,532 --> 00:05:50,166
But don't tell Quentin…

144
00:05:50,306 --> 00:05:52,235
I'm going to have to kill him too.

145
00:05:52,337 --> 00:05:53,947
Right after Margo.

146
00:06:04,049 --> 00:06:05,322
Margo?

147
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,478
Margo.

148
00:06:07,751 --> 00:06:10,587
Margo. Margo. Margo.
We got a serious problem, okay?

149
00:06:10,845 --> 00:06:12,288
I know. Eliot's cursed.

150
00:06:12,324 --> 00:06:14,324
No, no. Not just Eliot.
Alice and Quentin too.

151
00:06:14,359 --> 00:06:17,193
Listen, whatever you do, do
not sit on your throne, okay?

152
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:20,196
Fine. Whatevs. I have a plan.

153
00:06:20,565 --> 00:06:21,931
You gonna help me pick these?

154
00:06:21,967 --> 00:06:23,133
What's this? An antidote?

155
00:06:23,168 --> 00:06:24,601
Exactly. For the poison.

156
00:06:24,636 --> 00:06:25,946
For the… what?

157
00:06:27,063 --> 00:06:28,548
For the poison.

158
00:06:28,782 --> 00:06:31,829
I have to drink it first, or
I won't get Eliot to take it.

159
00:06:33,305 --> 00:06:37,013
Jesus. You're acting like
this is your first regicide.

160
00:06:37,048 --> 00:06:39,449
Also, it's not the
thrones that are cursed.

161
00:06:39,484 --> 00:06:41,782
I sat on mine, and I'm totally fine.

162
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,290
You sat on your…

163
00:06:44,022 --> 00:06:45,221
Fuck…

164
00:06:45,257 --> 00:06:46,649
Great. No, it's good.

165
00:06:46,758 --> 00:06:48,358
- Okay.
- Stop.

166
00:06:48,618 --> 00:06:49,718
This'll be over soon.

167
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,762
I'll deal with Eliot and Alice and Q.

168
00:06:53,415 --> 00:06:54,610
You're welcome.

169
00:06:58,798 --> 00:06:59,798
Shit.

00:07:18,758 --> 00:07:21,991
So, this is our little fox trap, huh?

172
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:23,266
Yeah.

173
00:07:23,923 --> 00:07:26,477
So, you want to tell me
where you hooked up with your partner?

174
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:27,864
The Dirty Dozen?

175
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:31,938
Ah. Fillory.

176
00:07:34,227 --> 00:07:35,872
Fine. Don't tell me.

177
00:07:38,415 --> 00:07:40,694
Listen, I'm here. I want to help.

178
00:07:40,719 --> 00:07:43,063
But that asshole seems
like severe psychic damage.

179
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,649
Look, I get it, okay?

180
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,716
But he knows a spell to freeze a god.

181
00:07:46,751 --> 00:07:49,001
I mean, you can't find that
at your local safe house.

182
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,222
Look, I have survived
this long on my instincts,

183
00:07:52,257 --> 00:07:54,123
and every one of them is telling me

184
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,523
that he is bad news.

185
00:07:55,548 --> 00:07:56,459
He's gonna turn on me.

186
00:07:56,494 --> 00:07:58,728
Or you. Or both of us.

187
00:07:58,763 --> 00:08:01,130
He can't, okay? We have an agreement.

188
00:08:01,246 --> 00:08:02,330
Word as bond.

189
00:08:02,355 --> 00:08:03,855
Those are tough to break.

190
00:08:04,457 --> 00:08:07,160
But if anyone could, it's someone
who could freeze a god.

191
00:08:07,722 --> 00:08:11,519
Are you girls discussing
the nature of our agreement?

192
00:08:11,972 --> 00:08:13,033
Marina was just asking.

193
00:08:13,058 --> 00:08:14,246
Straightforward.

194
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,446
I betray her, she cuts me to the quick.

195
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:18,448
So, tell me, what
happens after the tenets

196
00:08:18,483 --> 00:08:20,116
of the agreement are met?

197
00:08:20,268 --> 00:08:22,479
Why worry? You'll be long gone by then.

198
00:08:22,706 --> 00:08:25,292
So, tell me. Are we ready?

199
00:08:26,698 --> 00:08:27,698
Yeah.

200
00:08:28,034 --> 00:08:31,561
♪ A-hunting we will go,
a-hunting we will go ♪

201
00:08:31,776 --> 00:08:33,341
♪ We'll catch a fox and
put him in a box ♪

202
00:08:33,365 --> 00:08:35,393
♪ And then we'll let him go ♪

203
00:08:36,893 --> 00:08:39,354
What? Those are the lyrics.

204
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,658
Benedict, right?

205
00:08:48,033 --> 00:08:49,112
I need your help.

206
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:52,462
What do you do here again?

207
00:08:53,134 --> 00:08:54,570
Royal mapmaker, sire.

208
00:08:54,595 --> 00:08:57,391
Is your problem
cartographical in nature?

209
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:58,454
Not really.

210
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,591
What I need, Benedict, is a dagger.

211
00:09:01,723 --> 00:09:03,153
A stiletto, really.

212
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:06,653
Something I can sneak
up and stab someone with.

213
00:09:07,165 --> 00:09:08,331
But regal.

214
00:09:10,309 --> 00:09:11,903
I make maps, Your Majesty.

215
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,458
Well,… surely, someone has
snuck into your office

216
00:09:15,483 --> 00:09:18,293
and dramatically stabbed a knife
into a map to make a point, no?

217
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:20,955
The other Kings and Queens who died…

218
00:09:20,979 --> 00:09:23,746
we'd always just thought
it was just infighting.

219
00:09:23,782 --> 00:09:25,448
Greed and power.

220
00:09:25,483 --> 00:09:27,350
Guess what? It's just
another horrible thing

221
00:09:27,385 --> 00:09:31,521
The Beast was responsible
for, so how do we reverse this?

222
00:09:31,961 --> 00:09:33,554
Curses are tricky.

223
00:09:33,692 --> 00:09:35,226
You don't say.

224
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:38,859
They usually end once
they've run their course.

225
00:09:39,172 --> 00:09:40,256
And not before.

226
00:09:40,281 --> 00:09:41,468
That doesn't help us.

227
00:09:41,937 --> 00:09:44,457
This one seems to want to run its
course until they're all dead.

228
00:09:45,492 --> 00:09:47,851
Shit. Dead.

229
00:09:48,836 --> 00:09:49,945
- I have an idea.
- Okay.

230
00:09:50,211 --> 00:09:52,664
<i>Do not</i> let them kill each other, okay?

231
00:09:52,711 --> 00:09:53,711
Mm-hmm.

232
00:09:56,422 --> 00:09:57,984
<i>I call on you.</i>

233
00:09:58,242 --> 00:10:00,422
Our Lady Underground.

234
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,226
As a child of the Earth…

235
00:10:05,242 --> 00:10:08,453
I seek you, O Mother.

236
00:10:09,148 --> 00:10:10,758
- Hey.
- Mm?

237
00:10:11,234 --> 00:10:14,554
Do me a favor and just believe it.

238
00:10:15,328 --> 00:10:17,166
A benevolent Mommy who
will solve my problems

239
00:10:17,202 --> 00:10:19,136
with her Gaia power?

240
00:10:20,222 --> 00:10:22,714
Yeah. Or Reynard won't show.

241
00:10:23,847 --> 00:10:26,183
You realize I don't even
own a pair of yoga pants.

242
00:10:28,113 --> 00:10:29,144
So act.

243
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,292
I seek to know you, Divine Mother.

244
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,206
Giver of life and light.

245
00:10:50,542 --> 00:10:52,702
I ask to gaze upon you.

246
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,644
To hear your voice.

247
00:10:55,066 --> 00:10:57,273
To feel the beating heart of you.

248
00:10:57,503 --> 00:11:00,243
I beseech you. Hear me now.

249
00:11:03,175 --> 00:11:05,503
What happened? Where are we?

250
00:11:05,824 --> 00:11:07,644
A park. Few blocks away.

251
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,553
Is this a joke? Take us back now.

252
00:11:10,588 --> 00:11:12,394
Well, we can't go back.

253
00:11:12,628 --> 00:11:14,590
Reynard's scented you before.

254
00:11:14,626 --> 00:11:16,659
If he smells you again, he won't show.

255
00:11:16,941 --> 00:11:18,795
If you want him,

256
00:11:19,042 --> 00:11:21,308
you might just have to
risk losing your bait.

257
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,966
I'm sorry. You're saying this now?

258
00:11:24,144 --> 00:11:27,470
Well, if I'd told you before,
would you have agreed to it?

259
00:11:28,136 --> 00:11:29,613
Fine. I'll walk.

260
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,347
Oh, excellent idea.

261
00:11:31,417 --> 00:11:32,642
By the time we arrive,

262
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,844
he'll be so engrossed
in Marina's evisceration,

263
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:37,080
he won't even realize we're there.

264
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:38,574
You're good.

265
00:11:43,011 --> 00:11:46,255
I ask to gaze upon
you. To hear your voice.

266
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,690
To feel the beating heart of you.

267
00:11:47,725 --> 00:11:50,960
I ask to gaze upon
you! To hear your voice!

268
00:11:51,018 --> 00:11:53,398
To feel the beating heart of you!

269
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:00,570
Oh, you've got to be fucking kidding.

270
00:12:02,077 --> 00:12:03,206
Fuck this noise.

271
00:12:16,406 --> 00:12:17,487
What's so funny?

272
00:12:17,921 --> 00:12:19,632
You with a crossbow.

273
00:12:20,218 --> 00:12:23,242
You couldn't hit a fat girl
with a fat-girl-seeking arrow.

274
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:25,826
Oh, don't give me that look.

275
00:12:25,874 --> 00:12:27,640
It's a figure of speech.

276
00:12:28,273 --> 00:12:30,333
No way in hell I'll
miss you from this range.

277
00:12:30,429 --> 00:12:34,337
Well, if you use that arrow
as good as you use your dick…

278
00:12:38,054 --> 00:12:39,562
You enchanted yourself, didn't you?

279
00:12:39,656 --> 00:12:40,710
I'm not an idiot.

280
00:12:42,656 --> 00:12:45,348
Margo says go free.

281
00:12:49,954 --> 00:12:51,171
Oh, fuck…

282
00:12:52,835 --> 00:12:54,248
Jesus Christ.

283
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,591
Penny says go free.

284
00:13:07,438 --> 00:13:08,504
Aah!

285
00:13:11,442 --> 00:13:13,409
You just had to let him save you, huh?

286
00:13:13,874 --> 00:13:15,037
You're such a girl.

287
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:16,712
You know, I would like to see you dead

288
00:13:16,748 --> 00:13:18,248
regardless of your gender.

289
00:13:18,273 --> 00:13:19,890
Shut up. Both of you.

290
00:13:20,312 --> 00:13:22,084
I'm gonna take you someplace safe,

291
00:13:22,109 --> 00:13:23,264
but if I have to shoot
you to get you there,

292
00:13:23,288 --> 00:13:24,726
I will make sure it hurts.

293
00:13:24,827 --> 00:13:26,389
Gee, thanks, but I'm enchanted.

294
00:13:27,452 --> 00:13:28,492
Aah!

295
00:13:28,906 --> 00:13:30,342
Your enchantment's weak.

296
00:13:30,367 --> 00:13:31,632
Aah!

297
00:13:32,054 --> 00:13:34,030
You shot me, you cock.

298
00:13:34,476 --> 00:13:37,280
Why didn't you shoot her in the neck?
The carotid is right there.

299
00:13:46,648 --> 00:13:47,960
Don't fret.

300
00:13:48,538 --> 00:13:50,170
If Reynard had killed Marina,

301
00:13:50,195 --> 00:13:53,671
don't you think there'd be lots of
little Marina bits lying around?

302
00:13:53,696 --> 00:13:54,937
She ran.

303
00:13:55,593 --> 00:13:57,710
I don't think she even
finished the spell.

304
00:13:58,687 --> 00:14:01,090
We're gonna have to
start this all over again,

305
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,717
and now we've lost Marina.

306
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:04,171
I don't even know how
we're supposed to do…

307
00:14:04,195 --> 00:14:05,494
Don't be so hasty.

308
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,843
Are you absolutely sure it didn't work?

309
00:14:08,507 --> 00:14:09,732
If I were your fox god,

310
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:13,187
I might just, say, follow her home

311
00:14:13,476 --> 00:14:15,406
rather than kill her on the spot.

312
00:14:20,273 --> 00:14:21,959
You knew this was going to happen.

313
00:14:21,984 --> 00:14:23,882
Why do you think I
took you out of there?

314
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:27,650
Chin up. If I'm right, our
little summoning worked.

315
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:29,462
We just need to find foxy

316
00:14:29,487 --> 00:14:32,528
before he's finished with
his prey, n'est-ce pas?

317
00:14:55,356 --> 00:14:57,723
You just locked us
both inside, you know?

318
00:14:59,723 --> 00:15:01,278
You must be Marina.

319
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,004
Shit. Her wards are up.

320
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:12,254
We can't get inside.

321
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:14,606
Can you break them?

322
00:15:17,005 --> 00:15:18,965
Aha. Here.

323
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,192
That's one.

324
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:25,590
Settle in. This may take a bit.

325
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:31,340
Bad news… you're cursed.

326
00:15:31,762 --> 00:15:34,411
Good news… I think there's a way out.

327
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,184
Does it involve your beheading?

328
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:37,904
'Cause that's the ending
I'm voting for right now.

329
00:15:37,928 --> 00:15:40,567
I second that. My ass still hurts.

330
00:15:40,592 --> 00:15:41,684
Enough!

331
00:15:41,981 --> 00:15:43,029
Listen.

332
00:15:43,065 --> 00:15:44,698
I can't stop the curse,

333
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:47,411
so the plan is we're gonna
let it run its course.

334
00:15:47,567 --> 00:15:49,669
By killing you. All of you.

335
00:15:49,705 --> 00:15:51,705
- No likey.
- What's to likey?

336
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,807
The part where you're
dead sounds perfect.

337
00:15:53,842 --> 00:15:54,981
Shut up.

338
00:15:56,044 --> 00:15:58,145
Now, I took a little
trip to get supplies.

339
00:15:59,581 --> 00:16:02,036
Oh, goody. Heroin.

340
00:16:02,825 --> 00:16:05,058
I always suspected this was how I'd go.

341
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:08,098
Potassium chloride will
shut down the heart.

342
00:16:08,442 --> 00:16:10,739
Adrenaline will kick-start it.

343
00:16:11,364 --> 00:16:14,661
You die. Curse ends. I revive you.

344
00:16:14,696 --> 00:16:17,697
Except what if any part
of that plan doesn't work?

345
00:16:17,733 --> 00:16:19,733
Look, asshole. You don't like my idea,

346
00:16:19,768 --> 00:16:21,079
why don't you go find someone else

347
00:16:21,103 --> 00:16:22,669
to save your annoying fucking life?

348
00:16:22,767 --> 00:16:25,032
I have about a thousand better
things to do with my day.

349
00:16:28,543 --> 00:16:29,876
What the hell?

350
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,602
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

351
00:16:35,642 --> 00:16:39,886
My fingers are a little numb
due to the anti-curse things.

352
00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:41,855
Well, that's just perfect.

353
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,501
It's fine.

354
00:16:43,556 --> 00:16:45,095
Uh, it's fine.

355
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,860
So, are we still hostages or what?

356
00:16:46,885 --> 00:16:48,446
Yes. Yes, you are.

357
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,908
Would you point that thing
at their fucking heads?

358
00:16:50,932 --> 00:16:52,332
Everyone please,

359
00:16:52,367 --> 00:16:54,124
please just stand in your corners

360
00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:55,869
and just quietly…

361
00:16:57,118 --> 00:17:00,196
- Dang it, Margo.
- Yeah, yeah. Whatever.

362
00:17:00,852 --> 00:17:02,079
You're dead.

363
00:17:10,051 --> 00:17:12,610
I suppose this is one way to
get the killing bit over with?

364
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,446
Yeah.

365
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:16,149
This is what I was planning.

366
00:17:16,563 --> 00:17:20,704
The wards around this place
were deceptively advanced.

367
00:17:21,048 --> 00:17:23,657
I'm impressed. You have talent.

368
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:26,933
I bet you say that to all the girls

369
00:17:26,968 --> 00:17:29,806
right before you rape them,
kill them, and eat their hearts.

370
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,774
You wear that cynicism so stylishly.

371
00:17:33,642 --> 00:17:35,337
It's too bad I know it's a lie.

372
00:17:35,577 --> 00:17:36,665
Is it?

373
00:17:37,649 --> 00:17:40,071
No true cynic would call to the Goddess.

374
00:17:40,816 --> 00:17:43,532
That must hurt, to know
she wasn't listening.

375
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:46,415
On the plus side, I was.

376
00:17:46,868 --> 00:17:48,321
Listen, I love the foreplay.

377
00:17:48,356 --> 00:17:50,123
It's hot. It really is.

378
00:17:50,158 --> 00:17:51,954
But just get it over with and kill me…

379
00:17:54,149 --> 00:17:55,662
All in good time.

380
00:17:57,884 --> 00:17:59,199
You know, it doesn't take Freud

381
00:17:59,234 --> 00:18:01,467
to see that a god who
likes to prey on chicks

382
00:18:01,503 --> 00:18:04,985
is compensating for
a lack of… something.

383
00:18:06,349 --> 00:18:07,935
What even are you?

384
00:18:08,428 --> 00:18:10,201
God of Goat Herding?

385
00:18:10,654 --> 00:18:12,045
Grapes?

386
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:13,506
Oh, wait. Is it Manure?

387
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,584
I bet you love coming here
and fucking with mortals

388
00:18:17,619 --> 00:18:20,107
'cause back home in
god-land, you barely rank.

389
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:23,122
Watch your mouth, or I'll
slice out your tongue,

390
00:18:23,158 --> 00:18:24,855
and I'll eat it in front of you.

391
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:28,527
You're really not getting the
message that you don't scare me.

392
00:18:28,552 --> 00:18:31,074
Oh, I think I do scare you.

393
00:18:39,174 --> 00:18:43,097
So rare for someone to try to
summon Our Lady on their own.

394
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,800
You're all alone, aren't you?

395
00:18:45,981 --> 00:18:48,519
There's… no else in your life.

396
00:18:48,917 --> 00:18:50,042
Seriously?

397
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:52,518
Trying to hurt my feelings?

398
00:18:52,554 --> 00:18:53,798
And the best you can come up with

399
00:18:53,822 --> 00:18:56,022
is "why couldn't you find a man?"

400
00:18:56,183 --> 00:18:58,136
Is anyone really gonna miss you?

401
00:18:58,925 --> 00:19:00,605
I tip the pizza guy pretty well.

402
00:19:00,917 --> 00:19:01,917
Hmm

403
00:19:03,204 --> 00:19:04,449
Ah…

404
00:19:06,768 --> 00:19:08,446
You're not totally alone.

405
00:19:09,477 --> 00:19:12,405
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

406
00:19:13,675 --> 00:19:14,813
Aww

407
00:19:15,626 --> 00:19:16,733
Cupcake?

408
00:19:17,946 --> 00:19:19,274
What a cutie she is.

409
00:19:20,149 --> 00:19:23,649
You witches and your familiars.

410
00:19:24,452 --> 00:19:27,313
Hmm. You don't care for people,

411
00:19:28,266 --> 00:19:30,227
but you do love her, don't you?

412
00:19:31,459 --> 00:19:32,712
Don't be stupid.

413
00:19:33,001 --> 00:19:35,361
She's just a dumb cat. Put her down.

414
00:19:35,397 --> 00:19:38,876
No. I'd like to pet her.

415
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:57,278
Oh. Look at that.

416
00:19:57,372 --> 00:19:59,352
I think she might still be alive.

417
00:19:59,387 --> 00:20:00,911
That's funny.

418
00:20:02,551 --> 00:20:03,551
Uh-uh.

419
00:20:05,727 --> 00:20:06,727
No magic.

420
00:20:08,598 --> 00:20:09,716
Aah!

421
00:20:16,012 --> 00:20:17,012
See?

422
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:19,403
So much more fun to be had.

423
00:20:20,108 --> 00:20:21,411
What's the rush?

424
00:20:36,231 --> 00:20:41,684
Ha! I won, bitches. I'm
High motherfucking Queen.

425
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:43,763
Get the other needles. Hurry.

426
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:45,431
Hey! Stay back.

427
00:20:45,467 --> 00:20:46,677
Margo, we don't have time for this.

428
00:20:46,701 --> 00:20:47,800
We got to revive 'em now.

429
00:20:47,836 --> 00:20:49,569
What's best in life, Penny?

430
00:20:49,604 --> 00:20:50,471
What?

431
00:20:50,496 --> 00:20:52,138
What's best in life?

432
00:20:52,338 --> 00:20:53,906
I don't know.

433
00:20:53,942 --> 00:20:57,076
To crush your enemies,
see them driven before you,

434
00:20:57,112 --> 00:20:59,812
and hear the lamentations
of their women.

435
00:21:01,081 --> 00:21:03,174
Come at me, farm girl.

436
00:21:08,698 --> 00:21:11,479
That's one thorough fucking curse.

437
00:21:11,596 --> 00:21:14,495
Is it wrong to say I find her
death extremely satisfying?

438
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,029
Okay, come on. I need your help.

439
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:22,859
Oh, my God.

440
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,273
What the hell?

441
00:21:25,308 --> 00:21:27,960
Welcome back. Loser.

442
00:21:30,013 --> 00:21:31,882
Do you want me to get that?

443
00:21:32,449 --> 00:21:33,671
Aah…

444
00:21:39,437 --> 00:21:40,562
It's time.

445
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:44,765
Don't know how long I'll
have to cast the Rhinemann.

446
00:21:45,781 --> 00:21:48,296
Ugh. Eliot's right. It's a stupid name.

447
00:21:48,331 --> 00:21:50,093
And I wish I had a beer.

448
00:21:50,327 --> 00:21:51,671
That really doesn't look right.

449
00:21:51,785 --> 00:21:54,074
Does it require me playing Rachmaninoff?

450
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:57,472
If not… we're fine.

451
00:21:57,507 --> 00:21:59,018
Look, you still got to grab The Beast.

452
00:21:59,042 --> 00:22:00,742
What happens if you
take the bracelets off?

453
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,521
- That's a bad idea.
- Well, then, how are you…

454
00:22:02,545 --> 00:22:03,956
All I have to do is touch him, right?

455
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,179
So I'll tackle his ass, okay?

456
00:22:05,215 --> 00:22:08,738
Well, we are down two cacodemons.

457
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:11,238
Any ideas how to slow up The Beast now?

458
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:13,355
Actually, we only have one.

459
00:22:13,523 --> 00:22:14,622
I let mine go.

460
00:22:14,658 --> 00:22:16,808
Oh, Jesus. Come on.

461
00:22:16,894 --> 00:22:18,926
I could feel it. Alive and in my skin.

462
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:21,040
I couldn't stand the idea
of it being trapped in there.

463
00:22:21,064 --> 00:22:23,031
- Shocking no one.
- Just leave her alone.

464
00:22:23,066 --> 00:22:25,099
It's not like you
have yours. I do, so…

465
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,512
Because you were too much of a pussy

466
00:22:26,536 --> 00:22:27,468
to use it.

467
00:22:27,504 --> 00:22:28,691
I got this, Q.

468
00:22:29,926 --> 00:22:31,840
Okay. Idea.

469
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:34,175
Do you guys remember
the Sumerian shield charm

470
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,309
we learned in PA?

471
00:22:35,777 --> 00:22:36,577
Like, to keep you safe

472
00:22:36,613 --> 00:22:38,179
from shattered glass or something?

473
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:39,814
It's a simple spell,

474
00:22:39,849 --> 00:22:41,227
but that doesn't mean it's not powerful.

475
00:22:41,251 --> 00:22:42,995
Especially if all three
of us are casting it.

476
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:45,987
Use a first-year spell
to stop The Beast?

477
00:22:46,043 --> 00:22:47,388
That sounds like suicide.

478
00:22:47,424 --> 00:22:49,023
Which I've already tried today,

479
00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:50,291
and no, thank you.

480
00:22:50,326 --> 00:22:53,327
- Next.
- No. No. There is no next.

481
00:22:53,363 --> 00:22:56,731
We are running out of time
and options and god jizz.

482
00:22:56,766 --> 00:22:58,866
Look, just imagine dicks, okay?

483
00:22:58,902 --> 00:23:00,579
With one dick, you're
just jerking yourself off,

484
00:23:00,603 --> 00:23:02,403
but with three dicks,
suddenly you've got

485
00:23:02,439 --> 00:23:03,971
six people having sex.

486
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,917
Which is more powerful?

487
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:10,211
I think your metaphor literally
doesn't make any fucking sense.

488
00:23:10,246 --> 00:23:11,345
It doesn't have to.

489
00:23:11,381 --> 00:23:12,725
It just distracted you long enough

490
00:23:12,749 --> 00:23:14,148
for Alice to power up the spell,

491
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:17,423
which is all the shield charm has to do.

492
00:23:18,888 --> 00:23:20,088
I see what you did there.

493
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,735
Struck a nerve, didn't I?

494
00:23:28,001 --> 00:23:29,497
Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.

495
00:23:29,532 --> 00:23:31,478
I fell asleep for a moment.

496
00:23:32,423 --> 00:23:34,743
You ever eat something still alive?

497
00:23:36,407 --> 00:23:37,829
Can't say that I have.

498
00:23:38,415 --> 00:23:40,079
Civilized species and all.

499
00:23:41,321 --> 00:23:42,938
You're missing out.

500
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,712
I recommend starting at the far end,

501
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:50,587
so you can enjoy the fear.

502
00:23:51,774 --> 00:23:53,243
It's chemical.

503
00:23:54,165 --> 00:23:57,142
You can taste it. The fear.

504
00:23:59,267 --> 00:24:02,009
Not to mention the look on
your face. It's priceless.

505
00:24:02,465 --> 00:24:03,465
So why don't you and I…

506
00:24:08,671 --> 00:24:10,271
Apologies for the tardiness.

507
00:24:10,306 --> 00:24:12,640
You wards are rather extensive.

508
00:24:32,462 --> 00:24:33,558
Are we ready?

509
00:24:41,304 --> 00:24:42,347
Hey.

510
00:24:47,758 --> 00:24:48,792
Yeah.

511
00:25:21,845 --> 00:25:23,698
He's fighting the net.

512
00:25:24,534 --> 00:25:26,323
Not sure how much
longer I can hold this.

513
00:25:26,348 --> 00:25:27,648
Jesus Christ, Julia,

514
00:25:27,684 --> 00:25:29,517
would you please just gut this guy?

515
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,933
With pleasure.

516
00:25:36,142 --> 00:25:37,608
No! No…

517
00:25:58,114 --> 00:25:59,114
Now!

518
00:26:02,011 --> 00:26:03,217
- Julia.
- Blow that bitch up!

519
00:26:03,253 --> 00:26:04,685
Let's go.

520
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,333
Move!

521
00:26:34,456 --> 00:26:35,456
No!

522
00:26:36,286 --> 00:26:38,119
I missed him! I missed him!

523
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,106
I missed him! I missed him!

524
00:26:41,131 --> 00:26:42,247
I had Reynard.

525
00:26:42,272 --> 00:26:43,349
He was right in front of me.

526
00:26:43,373 --> 00:26:45,589
Yeah, and then you
screwed up our plan again.

527
00:26:45,614 --> 00:26:46,825
She just grabbed me.

528
00:26:46,849 --> 00:26:48,282
No, you all don't understand.

529
00:26:48,317 --> 00:26:50,417
I had Reynard. I had The Beast.

530
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,794
Fuck this. We're out.

531
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,716
Get off me!

532
00:26:59,014 --> 00:27:00,713
Where are we? Where did you take me?

533
00:27:00,872 --> 00:27:02,083
Subway's that way.

534
00:27:02,176 --> 00:27:03,516
Good luck with your bullshit.

535
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,880
Hey. Take me back.

536
00:27:05,287 --> 00:27:06,486
I need him.

537
00:27:06,898 --> 00:27:08,254
I need The Beast to kill Reynard.

538
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:09,355
Reynard has the knife.

539
00:27:09,391 --> 00:27:10,701
I can't do it without The Beast.

540
00:27:10,726 --> 00:27:11,812
It's not my problem.

541
00:27:13,261 --> 00:27:14,227
Oh, shit.

542
00:27:14,262 --> 00:27:15,395
Duck!

543
00:27:18,352 --> 00:27:20,460
- Shit…
- What the hell?

544
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:23,053
The chain was the only thing
keeping my hand from fucking…

545
00:27:23,077 --> 00:27:24,445
- Put it back on.
- I can't!

546
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,178
It's a ritual, and I don't have any…

547
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:27,911
Oh, no.

548
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:28,946
Get…

549
00:27:30,813 --> 00:27:31,779
Thank you.

550
00:27:31,814 --> 00:27:33,147
Yeah. No problem.

551
00:27:36,553 --> 00:27:38,531
- You fucking…
- Sorry.

552
00:27:38,835 --> 00:27:40,601
- Not my problem.
- Fuck.

553
00:27:49,031 --> 00:27:50,664
He's injured. Where else would he be?

554
00:27:50,699 --> 00:27:51,984
He has to be at the Wellspring.

555
00:27:52,009 --> 00:27:53,745
The Royal Carriage can
get there in under an hour.

556
00:27:53,769 --> 00:27:55,169
Okay, but if he can just blip in…

557
00:27:55,204 --> 00:27:56,870
Well, hopefully, his accuracy isn't

558
00:27:56,906 --> 00:27:59,006
at its best right now.
I know mine wouldn't be.

559
00:27:59,041 --> 00:28:01,175
Well, if those horses get
us there before The Beast,

560
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,509
I'll gladly fuck them both.

561
00:28:02,545 --> 00:28:05,005
Hey. Shh. Careful. Volume.

562
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,942
I think those are talking horses.

563
00:28:07,341 --> 00:28:08,682
Offer stands.

564
00:28:10,719 --> 00:28:12,341
Hey, can you still do this?

565
00:28:13,013 --> 00:28:14,302
I don't know.

566
00:28:14,497 --> 00:28:16,216
What choice do we have?

567
00:28:17,044 --> 00:28:18,721
Okay, we should send
El and Margo for help.

568
00:28:18,745 --> 00:28:21,060
Wait, you don't want us on
the suicide mission with you?

569
00:28:21,091 --> 00:28:22,347
Ember's temple is nearby,

570
00:28:22,382 --> 00:28:26,011
so just go and petition him for a re-up.

571
00:28:26,089 --> 00:28:27,167
Just in case Alice and I…

572
00:28:27,191 --> 00:28:28,667
Fail? Die?

573
00:28:30,128 --> 00:28:31,223
Sorry. Reflex.

574
00:28:31,258 --> 00:28:32,791
Okay. Fine. We'll go.

575
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:49,167
Hey. Thought exercise.

576
00:28:51,636 --> 00:28:56,323
Say we kill The Beast. Ahh… what then?

577
00:28:58,261 --> 00:28:59,542
Quentin, I don't know.

578
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,019
It's just… it's a distraction.

579
00:29:02,522 --> 00:29:03,761
Come on.

580
00:29:07,464 --> 00:29:09,105
Um…

581
00:29:11,019 --> 00:29:12,409
I would…

582
00:29:15,144 --> 00:29:17,167
I'd eat an ice cream sundae.

583
00:29:18,752 --> 00:29:20,308
With whipped cream and…

584
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:23,275
those fake rainbow-colored sprinkles

585
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:26,089
and… gummy bears on top.

586
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:29,748
I'm probably gonna try and win you back.

587
00:29:29,783 --> 00:29:31,214
Jesus, Quentin.

588
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,088
I'm sorry. That just sort
of flew out of my mouth.

589
00:29:33,112 --> 00:29:35,186
You know, I'm not a prize.

590
00:29:35,401 --> 00:29:36,988
I know that, but you know what I mean.

591
00:29:37,024 --> 00:29:39,581
No, and you didn't
just lose me like keys.

592
00:29:39,745 --> 00:29:42,128
I know, which is why I feel like I need

593
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,763
to earn back your trust.

594
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:46,347
This isn't fair.

595
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,347
You can't trap me in here.

596
00:29:50,058 --> 00:29:51,514
You can't trap me in here and expect me

597
00:29:51,538 --> 00:29:53,189
to deal with all this
heavy emotional shit

598
00:29:53,214 --> 00:29:54,606
when all I can handle right now…

599
00:29:54,641 --> 00:29:57,353
all I can handle right now is a
goddamn ice cream sundae, okay?

600
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,343
It's not a trap.

601
00:29:58,378 --> 00:29:59,811
Yes, it is, and why does it sound

602
00:29:59,846 --> 00:30:01,080
like you're trying to fight with me?

603
00:30:01,104 --> 00:30:03,180
Look. You've changed. Okay.

604
00:30:03,821 --> 00:30:07,319
You are not the girl that
I met a million years ago.

605
00:30:07,354 --> 00:30:09,157
You are amazing.

606
00:30:10,133 --> 00:30:12,657
And not that you weren't
amazing before, but…

607
00:30:13,751 --> 00:30:15,460
Quentin, where are you going with this?

608
00:30:15,852 --> 00:30:17,133
You've grown.

609
00:30:18,048 --> 00:30:21,566
And you're still growing,
and my point is that I am too.

610
00:30:21,868 --> 00:30:23,663
Are you saying you're
"not that guy anymore"?

611
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:26,271
No, I'm saying that I'm not<i>
just</i> that guy anymore,

612
00:30:26,306 --> 00:30:29,218
and I think that you…
I hope that you give me

613
00:30:29,243 --> 00:30:33,555
the opportunity to be better
and actually deserve you.

614
00:30:33,954 --> 00:30:36,414
And I know that that
sounds stupid, but I just…

615
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:39,050
I feel like we could
die in, like, an hour,

616
00:30:39,086 --> 00:30:42,235
and it's giving me a
lot of clarity right now.

617
00:30:44,493 --> 00:30:45,924
I don't know what to say, Quentin.

618
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:47,392
Also, I'm gonna make you

619
00:30:47,427 --> 00:30:50,161
the best ice cream
sundae you've ever had.

620
00:30:50,197 --> 00:30:51,896
You're gonna forget Popper 1,

621
00:30:51,932 --> 00:30:55,071
and I'm even gonna
put gummy bears on it,

622
00:30:55,282 --> 00:30:56,412
even though you don't understand

623
00:30:56,436 --> 00:30:58,563
how absolutely disgusting that is.

624
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:02,954
Quentin.

625
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,784
I'm sorry. I just was in the moment.

626
00:31:12,819 --> 00:31:14,673
Do you still want to fight?

627
00:31:15,789 --> 00:31:16,899
No.

628
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:24,798
Ember!

629
00:31:25,657 --> 00:31:27,008
Come out!

630
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:28,827
Hello?

631
00:31:28,852 --> 00:31:30,201
I'm pretty sure Q said

632
00:31:30,237 --> 00:31:32,226
the whole blood-stone
thing works right away.

633
00:31:32,251 --> 00:31:33,571
Fine. Give me your hand.

634
00:31:35,575 --> 00:31:36,674
Just…

635
00:31:38,485 --> 00:31:40,165
Oh, come on.

636
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,819
Ow. That kind of stings.

637
00:31:43,844 --> 00:31:44,962
Poor baby.

638
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:47,844
Great.

639
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:51,844
Well, now we're both bleeding.

640
00:31:52,204 --> 00:31:53,821
Maybe Ember isn't home.

641
00:31:54,305 --> 00:31:56,060
He's a god-in-exile.

642
00:31:56,096 --> 00:31:58,430
- <i>Where else could he be?
- I don't know.</i>

643
00:32:03,305 --> 00:32:04,446
Oh, God.

644
00:32:10,758 --> 00:32:12,410
Ah!

645
00:32:12,524 --> 00:32:17,610
Greetings, oh, powerful
and glorious Martin Chatwin.

646
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:21,419
My goodness. Only half
the man I remember.

647
00:32:21,587 --> 00:32:23,588
You know what happens
if you stay in Fillory.

648
00:32:23,623 --> 00:32:25,356
I know, I know. I'm leaving.

649
00:32:25,392 --> 00:32:28,821
I'm going. I just had
one or two things to do.

650
00:32:29,305 --> 00:32:30,673
Mainly number two.

651
00:32:32,032 --> 00:32:36,087
I have befouled the Wellspring.

652
00:32:36,751 --> 00:32:37,837
Pardon me?

653
00:32:37,862 --> 00:32:40,008
I have left my divine elimination

654
00:32:40,033 --> 00:32:41,391
in the font of all magic.

655
00:32:41,416 --> 00:32:42,423
And it's a stinker.

656
00:32:42,448 --> 00:32:44,431
I really hope you weren't
planning to drink from it.

657
00:32:44,455 --> 00:32:47,743
- It's hardly potable.
- You… what?

658
00:32:48,313 --> 00:32:53,579
Left my leavings… a
godly floater… behind.

659
00:32:54,826 --> 00:32:56,593
In the Wellspring.

660
00:32:59,118 --> 00:33:00,351
I pooped in it.

661
00:33:00,386 --> 00:33:01,969
Am I not making this very clear?

662
00:33:02,415 --> 00:33:03,930
You wretched bastard.

663
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:05,844
I know your true game.

664
00:33:05,977 --> 00:33:10,594
I know exactly every twist,
you… you stinking man-sheep!

665
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,229
Oh, my heavens. Look at the time.

666
00:33:12,265 --> 00:33:13,998
I really should be going,

667
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:17,535
although technically, I already went.

668
00:33:18,969 --> 00:33:21,079
I never tire of these jokes. Ta!

669
00:33:23,813 --> 00:33:26,126
Oh! Oh!

670
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,242
Oh!

671
00:33:32,915 --> 00:33:35,050
You stinking man-sheep!

672
00:33:35,085 --> 00:33:36,618
You're no god!

673
00:33:37,254 --> 00:33:40,766
You're no god! You're a farm animal!

674
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,727
Ember actually took a
shit in the Wellspring?

675
00:33:43,752 --> 00:33:44,969
<i>You're a farm animal!</i>

676
00:33:44,994 --> 00:33:46,844
Well, that can't be good for Fillory.

677
00:33:52,907 --> 00:33:55,188
Quentin Coldwater!

678
00:33:55,454 --> 00:33:56,576
Shit.

679
00:33:56,611 --> 00:33:59,313
Why don't you and Alice come join me?

680
00:34:04,219 --> 00:34:05,418
Mm.

681
00:34:05,453 --> 00:34:07,053
You're weaker.

682
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:08,921
And you're down six fingers.

683
00:34:10,091 --> 00:34:11,624
More than enough to kill you both.

684
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:16,462
Hard to cast when you're sliced in two.

685
00:34:22,403 --> 00:34:24,055
Quentin!

686
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,606
You're a tough piece
of meat, aren't you?

687
00:34:26,641 --> 00:34:27,874
No matter.

688
00:34:37,452 --> 00:34:38,573
Aah!

689
00:34:39,362 --> 00:34:40,518
Ahh!

690
00:34:48,713 --> 00:34:50,338
I guess we're gonna die.

691
00:34:51,065 --> 00:34:53,099
To our pretty corpses.

692
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:56,569
Children of Earth! I have returned.

693
00:34:56,604 --> 00:35:00,706
Spank my cheeks. You're both royalty.

694
00:35:00,778 --> 00:35:02,298
How delightful.

695
00:35:02,677 --> 00:35:05,081
You have come here to beseech me?

696
00:35:05,862 --> 00:35:07,885
Well, yes.

697
00:35:08,449 --> 00:35:12,551
We have come to beseech your uhm… aid.

698
00:35:12,587 --> 00:35:15,198
Of course! You shall have it.

699
00:35:15,549 --> 00:35:18,257
Oh. Oh, but then
you're going to miss it.

700
00:35:18,293 --> 00:35:20,059
- Miss what?
- All the action.

701
00:35:20,094 --> 00:35:21,627
Between you and me,

702
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:23,963
I think Alice should make
this a very good show.

703
00:35:24,017 --> 00:35:25,423
No promises, though.

704
00:35:25,495 --> 00:35:26,766
Cheerio! Happy ruling!

705
00:35:26,801 --> 00:35:28,424
- No…
- Ember, we…

706
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:32,087
Great. Kicked us out before
we could even ask for the jizz.

707
00:35:32,112 --> 00:35:33,112
Margo, look.

708
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:35,641
Is that all you got?

709
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:43,823
You're not even a real
magician, are you, Martin?

710
00:35:43,848 --> 00:35:46,463
You're just a scared little boy.

711
00:35:47,055 --> 00:35:49,440
You wouldn't last an hour at Brakebills.

712
00:36:02,315 --> 00:36:03,436
Ahh!

713
00:36:03,604 --> 00:36:04,706
Jesus.

714
00:36:05,139 --> 00:36:06,939
Alice is going full "Harry Potter"

715
00:36:06,975 --> 00:36:08,774
part seven/eight over there.

716
00:36:08,962 --> 00:36:10,749
Oh, God. I hope we're winning.

717
00:36:15,533 --> 00:36:16,932
Damn it.

718
00:36:26,432 --> 00:36:27,665
Alice, what are you doing?

719
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,604
No. Alice, don't. Stop, it'll…

720
00:36:31,629 --> 00:36:32,895
What is she doing?

721
00:36:33,273 --> 00:36:34,505
She can't. She'll Niffin out.

722
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,973
This is not good, Alice.

723
00:36:39,024 --> 00:36:40,290
Alice, stop!

724
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:41,526
It's okay.

725
00:36:42,295 --> 00:36:43,955
I've got this, Quentin.

726
00:36:47,018 --> 00:36:48,251
Alice, no!

727
00:36:57,729 --> 00:36:58,729
Alice!

728
00:37:02,588 --> 00:37:03,887
No!

729
00:37:12,635 --> 00:37:13,916
Oops.

730
00:37:14,455 --> 00:37:15,678
Too far.

731
00:37:17,427 --> 00:37:18,759
Too bad.

732
00:37:20,932 --> 00:37:23,947
Let's finally finish this.

733
00:37:33,474 --> 00:37:35,006
I did it on purpose.

734
00:37:37,502 --> 00:37:38,760
Move.

735
00:37:40,456 --> 00:37:41,947
- Let's go.
- We have to go.

736
00:37:41,972 --> 00:37:43,447
Go on.

737
00:37:44,331 --> 00:37:46,166
Something you want to say?

738
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:48,596
Alice.

739
00:37:49,202 --> 00:37:50,729
We can make a deal.

740
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:53,002
Think of the fun we could have together.

741
00:37:53,697 --> 00:37:54,846
You don't have to…

742
00:37:54,871 --> 00:37:55,937
But I want to.

743
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,440
Disappointing.

744
00:38:23,054 --> 00:38:24,486
Your turn.

745
00:38:33,379 --> 00:38:34,801
Alice!

746
00:38:39,253 --> 00:38:41,097
You got her attention. Now what?

747
00:38:43,215 --> 00:38:46,308
I'm sorry for all the times
I was a total dick to you.

748
00:38:46,468 --> 00:38:48,746
You're talking like you
mean something to me.

749
00:38:48,894 --> 00:38:50,511
Okay. Just…

750
00:38:52,415 --> 00:38:54,048
Alice. Don't.

751
00:39:01,082 --> 00:39:02,613
Go back.

752
00:39:02,638 --> 00:39:04,207
Quentin says go free.

753
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:21,004
Fuck.

754
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,137
Fuck.

755
00:39:51,035 --> 00:39:52,972
Alice.

756
00:39:53,931 --> 00:39:55,152
Alice.

757
00:40:03,647 --> 00:40:05,715
Alice. Hey. Hey.

758
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:11,832
Q, stop. You're hurt.

759
00:40:12,613 --> 00:40:14,566
Alice. Hey.

760
00:40:15,386 --> 00:40:16,519
You have to stop.

761
00:40:16,544 --> 00:40:18,079
Come on. She might be alive.

762
00:40:18,104 --> 00:40:19,383
- Just stop.
- She might be alive.

763
00:40:19,407 --> 00:40:20,660
You have to stop.

764
00:40:20,865 --> 00:40:23,426
Q, you have to stop.

765
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,769
You have to stop.

766
00:40:27,587 --> 00:40:28,824
You have to stop.
