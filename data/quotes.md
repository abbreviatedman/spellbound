# Magicians Quotes

## Unauthorized Magic

---


Am I hallucinating?

If you were, how would asking me help?

---

You want to go back to Columbia? That pointless, miasmic march to death you call life? Family that never calls and friends that don't really get you and feeling alone and wrong until it crushes you?

No.

Then quit dicking around!

Stop it.

Do some goddamn magic!

---

Are you guys trying to take over the world or...?

This school exists for a single and timeless purpose-- to reveal your innate abilities and hone them to the highest degree. Now, what you do with it after that is entirely up to you. If you want to take over the world, we don't teach that, but give it a go.

---

We all signed this waiver. I hope you read yours. It says, "Spellwork is not unlikely to murder you, and, if so, oh, well."

---

And I really don't want to be the guy who dies in the first ten minutes of the movie because he's like, "You know what? Let's take out the Ouija board. What could possibly go wrong?"

---

Look, I hear voices.

What, psychic?

No, God, I hate that word.

Okay, mind slut?

---

Look, so, I got to go somewhere, all right?

I'm obviously coming with you.

---

A few helpful rules-- Don't demand, ask. Safety first. Be patient-- nobody levels up in a day-- and don't leave your purse lying around.

And this is what exactly?

This is the real world, babe.

---

Quentin Coldwater... There you are.

## The Source of Magic

Welcome to the Physical Kids' Cottage. It's the single best place on campus for a number of reasons that will become clear as soon as you taste our signature cocktail.

---

Before I got here, I was in the hospital. I have--or I had-- I don't know, this thing that I couldn't shake where I felt like because nothing was ever not gonna be pointless and empty, then, uh, why go on? And then I... got here, and... it's amazing I survived as long as I did not knowing that I was a Magician. I can't go back.

---

If you're trying to tell me that it gets better--

Oh, God, no. No, it doesn't. I'm trying to tell you, you are not alone here.

---

Funny little irony they don't tell you, magic doesn't come from talent. It comes from pain.

---

Magic is real and that's the thing, and once you know that, you can't--

Nothing else matters.

Exactly. It's like... I know it's there. It's everywhere, all around me, a whole world of power and beauty. [chuckles] You can't unsee it. You wake up for the first time.

---

You do not have to make me feel better, we-- really, we basically just met each other.

Well, I bond fast. Time is an illusion.

---

I go back there, and I'm... I'm a depressed super nerd.

How about I find you, and I don't say magic is real, but I do seduce you, and so lift your spirits that life retains its sparkle for decades.

Yeah, that sounds nice. Thank you.

---

The books, they're just-- They always felt realer than anything.

Then it's real.

---

Do you think you have a destiny?

Um, yes.

Yeah. I used to believe that crap too when I was young. There is no destiny, no born heroes. I can't tell you why-- why The Beast came sniffing for you. There's no reason it should be you. You can either step up to it or not, it's up to you.

---

Join the party, sad sack. Hurry up. Oh, my God, it's not like we have all day. We're so drunk. Okay, we have all day.

# Consequences of Advanced Spellcasting

Or, you know, you're keeping him around in case you fail here and need to fall back. All I know... you have to mean it for magic to work. Something clicks when you're all-in, and the real big stuff, you can't do it till you're doing it without a net

---

No, don't run. These shoes are insane.

---

Hedge witches. Amateurs. Magical D-leaguers. Sad and desperate people. Once one of 'em offered to blow me for a spell. It was fairly worth it.

---

You've been a thin layer of insouciance over an open pit of self-pity your entire life.

---

Where you going, kitty cat?

I'm done here. For good. You should be happy. Less competition.

Alice. I like competition.

# The World In The Walls

Magic does not solve problems. It magnifies them.

I know that too. Believe me. I don't need to be taught what magic is or isn't. I need to be taught magic so that I can decide what it is or isn't... for me.

That was almost well put.

# Mendings Major and Minor

I zapped myself onto Mount Everest. Lost my leg to frostbite. I'd be dead if not for one deeply confused Sherpa

---

How could you know about all this and become a podiatrist?

This isn't Middle Earth, Quentin. There aren't enough noble quests to go around.

---

Quentin, by the time you were ten years old, buddy, I couldn't sit through one more card trick, but if that's what makes the world bearable to you, then you go off and do card tricks.

---

Why do you think you were able to do that? Please tell me someone has pointed out to you that magic doesn't come from sunshine and ice cream, for any of us.

---

A great way to get the things you want is to be so miserable, you don't want them anymore.

What kind of system is that? You know, why can't it run on... love... or cocaine or something?

---

It's not their fault that they're the tortoise and you're the hare.

They're not even in the race.

---

What's your poison?

Um, I don't know. I just poured something.

[sniffs] Yuck. I have so much to teach you about drinking. It's a three-year program. Graduate level. It begins immediately.

---

The spell you were attempting to cast is part of a class of magic strictly forbidden for all students. It is also strictly forbidden for everyone else.

# Impractical Applications

---

Oh, nut up, this isn't Harvard. It requires actual effort.

---

You ever want something so badly and then realize that it's nothing like what you thought? And maybe that you are stupid for ever actually even wanting it.

Every guy I've ever slept with.

---

The thing that attacked us that ripped the Dean's eyes out, seems like it might be from Fillory.

Jesus. That is not tonally consistent with the books.

---

You're the best. You know what? I try so hard not to be. Why? I'm already pretty damn unpopular. Can you imagine what they would think if they knew how good I really am?

# The Mayakovsky Circumstance

You learn magic like parrot learns Shakespeare: tricks for birdseeds.

---

A great Magician-- and as you gaze into your mirrors in the coming years, you may recall that I was the last great Magician you ever saw, a great Magician _is_ magic in his bones, blood, heart, and dick. Or lady parts. Whatever.

---

Uh... isn't that kind of unethical? I mean, even if they're bugs, they're alive. They have free will. We've been taught not to try to control living things. How was your lunch today? Excellent boeuf bourguignon, no? And how much free will was exerted by the cow?

---

Mind control is in everything, everywhere. We make only one choice: are you the controller or controlled?

---

Your fate is now tied to the lowest form of sentient life. I deem that... appropriate.

---

Where's the joy? The fun? Why are you both determined to be so fucking bland?

---

I'd just like to point out that for the record, you guys basically did nothing except each other. Todd was more helpful than you. Don't. I'm just using you for effect.

---

What am I supposed to do?

What we all do each moment. Decide.

---

Go and live to prove me wrong. Love each other, be honest and kind, faithful and happy, and then, come back here in 50 years with your perfect family and gloat over my frozen corpse

# The strangled Heart

How was Brakebills South? Did anyone freeze to death?

Oh, I mean, it was-- [clearing his throat] it was eventful. I--

Why is your face making that face?

---

Let me guess. You got drunk on Mayakovsky's lichen vodka and you seduced him.

Maybe I seduced her.

Please. And sweetie, getting drunk and porking a dungeon master is nothing to be a ashamed of.

---

What we did was stress and circumstances, and pheromones.

The first time, but not the next four.

You were...counting?

Of course I was counting.

---

When I was four years old, with no instruction or help from anyone, I taught myself magic. I will do so again.

---

I have nothing to wear.

You think that might be, I don't know, hyperbole?

I am not emotionally prepared for Mike to see me repeat outfits.

---

You can change everything about your circumstances, but the one thing that won't have changed is you. Same head, same heart, same mistakes.

---

Maybe we just need to accept the world for what actually is.

Oh, what about making the world what we want it to be? You know, with a little effort, a little faith.

Give a man hope and a nickel, you got a nickel.

---

I thought it was a fern.

Which is why I brought flash cards.

Of course you did.

---

I don't know about music and wine, and frankly any country not named Texas.

Texas is a state.

Not when you're from Texas.

---

Could have anything to do with the Beast?

Why would it?

Because it makes more sense than somebody new try to kill me.

---

You realized that knife was coming at me before you jump in the way of it, right? I owe you, like, a Wookie Life Debt.

Get a knife. I'll stab you right now.

---

The books are a child's drawing of Fillory. The real thing is stranger.

---

Jane's mother gave it to her... before she died. It was all she took with her to Fillory. Her only reminder of her family and her life on Earth. It was her most precious possession. What we love can be as important to us as our lives.

---

Lock as many doors as you want, there's always a door to Fillory when you need one.

---

There are no answers, Quentin. Because we have no idea what's going to happen next.

# The Writing Room

Plover's previous work, uh, he--well, he only got rejections for it. It just didn't really show the depth of the "Fillory and Further" series.

Stay close. I'm not sure I can do this tour without you.

---

Hey, would you break up with me if I told you that I've never been happier in my entire life?

---

The world never did help a smart girl. Why would it? We scare the shit out of the world.

---

What do you think redemption looks like, Julia? Being nice? Donating shoes to Africa? You think that really burns the tumors off your soul?

---

What am I supposed to do?

Whichever's hardest.

# Homecoming

I respect the shit out of you both, and you are leaders, and you're people, and I'm a feminist--

If you would just shut up for two seconds, this sex dream would pass the Bechdel test, Quentin.

---

Every book is here--all the books ever written, all the books never written, all the books of all the people who ever lived.

This is my book. Yo. Why are there all these flowers and shit on the cover?

People who read their books often discover they don't like the main character and are rarely happy with how it ends.

# Remedial Battle Magic

Well, I hate to say I told you so, but--you know what? Actually, I don't. I don't. I don't hate that.

---

We need some serious battle magic.

But that stuff's illegal. I'm fucking with you. I'm in.

---

Penny, you will never have a home. You will never have a real family. Your gifts will take this from you over and over. So when someone cares enough to reach out a hand, just drop the bullshit attitude and take what they're offering while you can.

---

If you can read my mind, you know that we both have knives in our pockets dipped in gold and silver and coated in shark's blood.

Jesus, that's overkill.

We weren't sure which legends were true.

---

I mean, what do you want me to say? "I give up"? "Forget about ever really fixing anything"? No, we keep trying, okay? At least I do. You do whatever you want.

Well, I'm not going anywhere. I mean, this is my house.

---

There's this thing about you, Q. You actually believe in magic.

So does everyone.

No. We all knows it's real, but you believe in it.

---

So Midori, hmm? Does it work?

Nothing works forever. But, you know, if you stop worrying about forever, there's plenty of shit that can get you through the next hour.

---

That bite, that-- that thing in you that wants to puzzle everything out, that is gold.

No matter how crabby it makes me?

I think especially when it makes you crabby.

---

I think that us angry, questioning people sometimes shut up too fast, and that is probably part of why the gods took off. No one around with the fire to keep yelling their names. This is gonna sound corny, but don't lose that fire.

---

Penny, Alice, Eliot, and Janet, you are all late.

Actually, it's Margo.

This time.

# Have You Brought Me Little Cakes?

You're not as good as I hoped, Quentin Coldwater.

But you're better than you know.

---

You can't unring a bell.

# Knight Of Crowns

Witch: You're in Fillory, Magician. Be careful with strangers. We only look whimsical.

---

Eliot: We'll figure it out. We always do.

Margo: When it's a final to cheat on, not when we're stuck in some epic fantasy that likes to behead its heroes halfway through season one.

If we even are heroes.

We might be comic relief.

---

Alice: I have no idea what to do now.

Margo: So we are fucked without grease.

Quentin: That sounds like us.

Eliot: Must be a Monday.

Onward to glory.

---

Martin: "Tweet"? Birds have computer accounts?

Julia: Don't worry about it.

---

Julia: He's still in Richard's body.

Martin: Richard doesn't care, darling.

Julia: I f\*cking do.

---

Knight of Crowns: As you know, only a Child Of Earth can wear the crown of the High King.

I will ask you a series of questions designed to root out all pretenders to the throne.

Only a true High King will hold the answers in his heart.

Eliot: Come at me.

Knight of Crowns: What popular American television program stars actor Tim Daly?

---

Eliot: Ask me something about Patrick Swayze.

Knight of Crowns: You know of Swayze?

---

Eliot: I do hereby crown you High Queen Margo the Destroyer.

I mean that in the best possible sense.

---

Margo: Uh, I could start by saying something cruel yet totally hilarious about you.

Let's be real, you're an easy target.

But that's-- well, that's because you're honest about what you love.

And underneath it all, that's... inspiring.

---

Margo: Now that we're ruling a kingdom together, I hope we can be whatever we were again.

Quentin: I guess you could call that friends.

Margo: Let's go with that.

I hereby crown you King Quentin the Moderately Socially Maladjusted.

---

Martin: It's called a Shade.

Julia: Shade.

Martin: It's what makes you feel the pain will burn you till there's nothing.

And, yes, it's also there for love, but, uh, let's be frank, darling, you're more likely to throw yourself off a bridge than ever love again.

---

Eliot: You know, it's considered extremely disrespectful to touch a king without permission.

But, um, I think you should... probably hug me right now.

[exhales deeply]

It'll also be okay if you just give my ass, like, a little squeeze.

# Hotel Spa Potions

---

Martin: All I do is accept what you fight.

Julia: Yeah. Which is?

Martin: Life is pointless.

The after-life even more so.

Which is why we invent these games to fill the void of existence.

Who diddled whom. Who'll get revenge for it.

Who takes the throne.

---

Fen: I'm your wife. I want to be obedient.

Eliot: Sit down.

Nobody wants to be obedient.

---

Quentin: If it hurts, then...

Alice: Not everything that hurts is bad.

---

Marina: I was the best student you ever had here. You said that.

Dean Fogg: I confused talent with character. You need both to be a true magician, Marina.

---

Dean Fogg: You can keep your memories. I hope that whatever you've learned here will help keep you safe.

Marina: What I learned here will get me killed.

---

Bigby: Humans least attractive qualities. Panic and paranoia.

Dean Fogg: And there were several student deaths that semester.

Bigby: Far fewer than the 1870s, or the 1920s, or the '60s. Another human failing, short memory.

---

Bigby: I can feel your power. It's almost... [chuckles] it's almost god-like.

Did you fuck one of them? I mean, they are wonderful, aren't they? At least mine was.

I glowed for weeks. No, literally.

# Divine Elimination

Eliot: The spell that won World War II is called the Rhinemann Ultra?

Sounds like a not-so-great beer.

---

Penny: Wait, is this really the most important thing we could be doing right now? I mean, The Beast is still out there waiting for us...

Eliot: The Beast can wait for five minutes. You are all Kings and Queens of Fillory. Well, almost all of you. Just revel in your majesty for one f\*cking second. Be regal, miscreants.

---

Eliot: Because I promise you...I will not go down easily.

Oo-surpers.

Usurpers.

[sighs]

Whichever way you're supposed to pronounce it.

---

Marina: [sarcastically] I call on you.

Our Lady Underground.

As a child of the Earth...

I seek you, O Mother.

Julia: Hey.

Marina: Mm?

Julia: Do me a favor and just believe it.

Marina: A benevolent Mommy who will solve my problems with her Gaia power?

Julia: Yeah. Or Reynard won't show.

Marina: You realize I don't even own a pair of yoga pants.

---

Quentin: What's so funny?

Margo: You with a crossbow.

You couldn't hit a fat girl with a fat-girl-seeking arrow.

Oh, don't give me that look.

It's a figure of speech.

---

Reynard: You're all alone, aren't you?

There's... no else in your life.

Marina: Seriously? Trying to hurt my feelings?

And the best you can come up with is "why couldn't you find a man?"

Reynard: Is anyone really gonna miss you?

Marina: I tip the pizza guy pretty well.

---

Margo: Well, if those horses get us there before The Beast, I'll gladly f\*ck them both.

Eliot: Hey. Shh. Careful. Volume.

I think those are talking horses.

Margo: Offer stands.

---

Quentin: Look. You've changed. Okay.

You are not the girl that I met a million years ago.

You are amazing.

And not that you weren't amazing before, but...

Alice: Quentin, where are you going with this?

Quentin: You've grown.

And you're still growing, and my point is that I am too.

Alice: Are you saying you're "not that guy anymore"?

Quentin: No, I'm saying that I'm not just that guy anymore, and I think that you...I hope that you give me the opportunity to be better and actually deserve you.

---

Ember: I'm going. I just had one or two things to do.

Mainly number two.

I have befouled the Wellspring.

Martin: Pardon me?

Ember: I have left my divine elimination in the font of all magic.

And it's a stinker.

I really hope you weren't planning to drink from it.

It's hardly potable.

Martin: You... what?

Ember: Left my leavings... a godly floater... behind.

In the Wellspring.

I pooped in it.

Am I not making this very clear?

---

Eliot: I guess we're gonna die.

Margo: To our pretty corpses.

# The Flying Forest

Margo: Can you give us a moment?

I said get the fuck out.

---

Eliot: Todd, answer truthfully.

Are you wearing my vest?

Todd: I am wearing your vest.

Eliot: Keep it. [sighs] New plan-- I give up on Fillory and dedicate myself completely to destroying Todd.

---

Eliot: I'm married... to a woman.

Javier: I have a boyfriend. but he's on another continent, so... it doesn't count.

And where is your wife?

Eliot: On another planet.

Javier: [scoffs] Definitely doesn't count.

---

Dean Fogg: Ember shat in the Wellspring.

Eliot: [sighs] I think he meant well. He probably didn't know how hard it would be to clean out.

Dean Fogg: And now magic is failing on Earth... because of shit, proving once again that comedy and tragedy can coexist in the same goddamn sentence.

---

Julia: You actually think because you go to this bullshit school that you're better than me.

Margo: I think I didn't get my friends killed.

Julia: You don't have friends.

You have people that are so afraid of you, they'd rather be on your side.

There's a difference.

---

The White Lady: What is it, Quentin Coldwater, that you ache for? You have a crown and the power to reshape the very ether to your whim. What else could you possibly want?

---

Penny: Um, technically speaking, uh, we both caught you, so...

Quentin: Shut up. I'll ask for your thing with my third wish.

Penny: No. We each get a wish, and then we have one mutually agreeable third wish.

The White Lady: You can each have one wish, or you can fuck off.

---

The White Lady: But you should know... there's nothing I can give you that will soothe your Shade.

There's only what I can take away.

Quentin: You'd take away my memories of Alice?

The White Lady: Yes. I would free you completely.

Quentin: No.

The White Lady: You are wiser than you appear. You would find your way back to sadness, no matter how far you run from it.
