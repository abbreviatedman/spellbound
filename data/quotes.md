## Unauthorized Magic

1
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:52,953
There you are.

2
00:00:53,055 --> 00:00:55,755
You're late. I have
a school to run.

3
00:00:55,857 --> 00:00:57,691
There are more important things.

4
00:00:57,793 --> 00:00:59,826
It's always something
with you, isn't it?

5
00:00:59,928 --> 00:01:03,129
It's always an emergency.

6
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:05,073
It's happening.

7
00:01:05,074 --> 00:01:07,363
GLOBAL WARMING:
DEFINITE PROOF?

8
00:01:13,809 --> 00:01:15,775
They're not even
at Brakebills yet.

9
00:01:15,877 --> 00:01:18,511
I know. Get them there.

10
00:01:18,614 --> 00:01:21,314
Pray that they get a little
something under their belts

11
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:23,516
before he finds a way to them.

12
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:26,653
Your ability to think

13
00:01:26,755 --> 00:01:28,955
that we have the slightest
molecule of control

14
00:01:29,057 --> 00:01:31,457
over anything never
ceases to amaze me.

15
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:34,293
It's not that.

16
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:36,029
I have to try.

17
00:01:36,281 --> 00:01:37,797
We.

18
00:01:37,899 --> 00:01:39,465
Look, this is your
responsibility.

19
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:41,801
You have to get them ready.
They're infants.

20
00:01:41,903 --> 00:01:44,804
They know nothing, especially...

21
00:01:44,906 --> 00:01:47,240
especially him.

22
00:01:47,342 --> 00:01:50,043
I will do what I can,

23
00:01:50,145 --> 00:01:52,746
and you know this.

24
00:01:52,848 --> 00:01:54,748
I do know.

25
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:57,583
Here...

26
00:01:57,686 --> 00:01:59,619
just in case.

27
00:02:02,357 --> 00:02:04,758
You do still have an eye
on our boy, don't you?

28
00:02:06,028 --> 00:02:07,226
Yes.

29
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:09,495
Great. Great.

30
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:11,865
Not exactly.

31
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:13,266
Why not?

32
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:15,301
Where is he?

33
00:02:21,888 --> 00:02:26,684
MIDTOWN MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC

34
00:02:51,795 --> 00:02:53,173
Nice trick.

35
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,010
Well, I'm sure you're
a hit at parties.

36
00:03:27,876 --> 00:03:29,776
So...

37
00:03:29,811 --> 00:03:32,045
you think you're ready.

38
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,948
- I do.
- Why?

39
00:03:34,983 --> 00:03:36,582
I feel better.

40
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:42,055
On admitting, you reported
you couldn't concentrate,

41
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,556
eat, get out of bed.

42
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:45,225
You said the feeling

43
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,027
of not belonging anywhere
was overwhelming.

44
00:03:48,063 --> 00:03:50,596
It's not sleight of hand
if you're gonna use CGI.

45
00:03:50,632 --> 00:03:52,198
Well, I'm sorry. It's just...

46
00:03:52,234 --> 00:03:53,733
That's insulting to
anyone who's ever done

47
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:55,235
any kind of close-up
magic, so...

48
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,736
And that you were the
most useless person

49
00:03:56,772 --> 00:03:58,738
who ever lived.

50
00:03:58,774 --> 00:04:02,208
And now... you feel better?

51
00:04:02,244 --> 00:04:04,043
It's the original version,
the Danish version,

52
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:05,378
that it's, like... it's dark.

53
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:07,113
It's, like, 100 times better

54
00:04:07,149 --> 00:04:10,083
because the Danish people, they're...
they're...

55
00:04:10,118 --> 00:04:11,317
they have a dark soul.

56
00:04:11,352 --> 00:04:13,086
I mean, I get it.

57
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:15,588
Get...?

58
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:17,490
You're a kid, and your
whole life's ahead of you,

59
00:04:17,525 --> 00:04:19,458
and you have these notions...

60
00:04:19,494 --> 00:04:22,762
about what life is...

61
00:04:22,798 --> 00:04:25,932
and...

62
00:04:25,967 --> 00:04:28,134
what it could be.

63
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:30,804
But eventually you have
to let all that go.

64
00:04:32,808 --> 00:04:34,908
So that's what I'm... that's
what I'm going to do.

65
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,910
That's what I'm doing.

66
00:04:38,216 --> 00:04:39,745
It's a part of growing up...

67
00:04:39,781 --> 00:04:41,247
you know, selling the
comic-book collection

68
00:04:41,283 --> 00:04:42,816
and getting serious.

69
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:08,407
You graduate soon.

70
00:05:09,978 --> 00:05:11,777
- And then?
- I'm supposed to have

71
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,613
a grad-school interview
on Tuesday... Yale.

72
00:05:14,716 --> 00:05:17,717
Quentin, I'd really recommend
further treatment.

73
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:20,586
Look, I've never threatened to
hurt myself or anybody else.

74
00:05:22,324 --> 00:05:24,757
So you can't make me stay.

75
00:05:25,894 --> 00:05:27,727
Can you?

76
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,058
THAYER QUALITY MAGIC VOL.1

77
00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:36,166
THE ANNOTATED MAGIC OF SLYDINI

78
00:05:36,167 --> 00:05:38,305
FILLORY AND FURTHER
THE WORLD IN THE WALLS

79
00:05:44,123 --> 00:05:47,703
FILLORY AND FURTHER
BOOK ONE

80
00:05:56,057 --> 00:05:58,457
The Chatwin Twins and
their older brother

81
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:00,159
had been sent to
the countryside.

82
00:06:00,262 --> 00:06:02,061
From a young age,

83
00:06:02,163 --> 00:06:04,830
Martin Chatwin had
a gloomy nature.

84
00:06:06,234 --> 00:06:07,967
And to combat his melancholy,

85
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:10,970
he would lose himself
in stories of wonder.

86
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,973
So he knew that he would
have trouble convincing

87
00:06:14,075 --> 00:06:16,976
his brother and sister
that this was no fantasy.

88
00:06:18,179 --> 00:06:20,446
Rupert, wounded in the war

89
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:23,149
and the first Chatwin to put
away childish things...

90
00:06:27,722 --> 00:06:31,657
And Jane, the family skeptic.

91
00:06:51,913 --> 00:06:55,048
This was Fillory.

92
00:06:57,585 --> 00:06:59,885
A land of magic.

93
00:07:04,426 --> 00:07:08,194
Rupert! Martin! Have
a look at this!

94
00:07:08,296 --> 00:07:12,465
Martin thought they
needed Fillory...

95
00:07:12,567 --> 00:07:16,802
but, no, Fillory needed them.

96
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:20,006
It is here that
our story begins,

97
00:07:20,108 --> 00:07:22,241
but be warned...

98
00:07:22,344 --> 00:07:24,877
this adventure is no
mere children's tale.

99
00:07:30,051 --> 00:07:31,717
Where'd she go?

100
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:34,320
The... the girl in
the rainbow shorts?

101
00:07:34,422 --> 00:07:35,721
Yeah, you just missed her.

102
00:07:35,823 --> 00:07:37,723
And?

103
00:07:37,825 --> 00:07:39,725
Not my type.

104
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:42,895
Dude, she was wearing
a unicorn T-shirt.

105
00:07:42,998 --> 00:07:44,597
She's clearly into fantasy.

106
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:45,898
But how would you know?

107
00:07:46,001 --> 00:07:48,368
You're in here reading
obscure fantasy,

108
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,669
and she's out there.

109
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:54,440
Honestly, like, 73 of her...

110
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:57,243
kind of waiting for you to
finish reading the books

111
00:07:57,345 --> 00:07:59,178
you've already read 800 times
and come out of your room.

112
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,080
I'm about to. It's just
it's a first edition,

113
00:08:01,182 --> 00:08:04,683
and I am looking at
it one last time

114
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:06,652
before I sell it on eBay.

115
00:08:09,057 --> 00:08:11,457
Oh, I'm sorry. Is this a
serious conversation?

116
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:13,326
Should I sit up?

117
00:08:20,502 --> 00:08:22,801
I called you...

118
00:08:22,904 --> 00:08:24,404
all weekend.

119
00:08:24,506 --> 00:08:27,806
Where were you?

120
00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:29,642
I was at my dad's.

121
00:08:29,744 --> 00:08:31,644
I got angsty prepping
for the interview,

122
00:08:31,746 --> 00:08:33,279
and I...

123
00:08:33,381 --> 00:08:34,780
I fled...

124
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:38,251
for the magical hills of Jersey.

125
00:08:38,353 --> 00:08:40,253
Don't judge.

126
00:08:40,355 --> 00:08:41,787
I'd never.

127
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:46,725
Oh, my God.

128
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:50,063
My girl. My friend.

129
00:08:50,165 --> 00:08:53,099
- Have you no decency?
- Not even a little.

130
00:08:53,201 --> 00:08:55,468
Excellent. Three-way!

131
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,802
No, no, no, no!

132
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,308
Okay, we have got to
pull you together.

133
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,410
- This is it, Quentin. It.
- I'm still high.

134
00:09:04,512 --> 00:09:06,245
I just... Okay, you know what?
Screw it.

135
00:09:06,347 --> 00:09:08,147
- It's only the alumni interview.
- Right.

136
00:09:08,249 --> 00:09:10,416
- And it's only Yale.
- Right, lesser Ivy.

137
00:09:10,518 --> 00:09:12,151
And, honestly, they probably
take anyone conscious

138
00:09:12,253 --> 00:09:13,519
for philosophy.

139
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:14,853
For philosophy, "conscious"
is a detriment.

140
00:09:14,956 --> 00:09:17,690
- So I'm good.
- You're great.

141
00:09:25,066 --> 00:09:27,200
- You know, you can go.
- Hey.

142
00:09:27,302 --> 00:09:30,369
I am the angel protecting
your future, Coldwater.

143
00:09:30,472 --> 00:09:33,339
Tighten your shit.

144
00:09:33,441 --> 00:09:35,708
Yes, ma'am.

145
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:44,917
Hello?

146
00:09:51,226 --> 00:09:53,692
It's Quentin Coldwater

147
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:56,662
for the grad-school interview?

148
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:04,837
I don't believe it.

149
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,550
Oh, shit!

150
00:10:26,055 --> 00:10:34,679
www.TUSUBTITULO.com
-DIFUNDE LA CULTURA-

151
00:10:43,178 --> 00:10:45,578
Well...

152
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,181
he's dead.

153
00:10:48,283 --> 00:10:51,317
By the look of him,
he was a big...

154
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:53,619
- I'm sorry?
- Why? Did you kill him?

155
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:55,821
No. Jesus.

156
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:57,856
I was kidding.

157
00:10:58,562 --> 00:11:00,359
Can we go now?

158
00:11:01,362 --> 00:11:03,362
Let's go.

159
00:11:05,567 --> 00:11:07,500
Wait!

160
00:11:07,602 --> 00:11:09,535
I think he left
something for you.

161
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:12,838
Q, come on, let's go.

162
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:19,445
Look at that.

163
00:11:19,547 --> 00:11:21,681
"Fillory and Further,
Book Six: The Magicians."

164
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:24,783
- Look at the date... 1952.
- All right, please.

165
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:27,453
There are five Fillory
books, Julia... five.

166
00:11:27,555 --> 00:11:29,222
Yeah, I-I know, Quentin.
Everyone knows.

167
00:11:29,324 --> 00:11:31,290
There's always been rumors of a
sixth book that disappeared.

168
00:11:31,392 --> 00:11:32,891
Yeah, and those are
just some stupid rumors

169
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:34,660
off a super-fan message board.

170
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:36,161
- Come on, don't be naive.
- Maybe, but maybe it's...

171
00:11:36,264 --> 00:11:37,463
What, it's a very
special art project

172
00:11:37,565 --> 00:11:38,664
that the dead guy made up?

173
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:40,333
'Cause I don't know...

174
00:11:40,435 --> 00:11:42,067
you wrote your admissions essay
on the glory of Fillory?

175
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:43,703
- Come on, Q.
- Come on. What if...

176
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:45,238
No! You have to stop!

177
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,706
Stop what?

178
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:48,874
You can't run away
hard enough, can you?

179
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:53,312
What happened to giving
up on the Fillory crap?

180
00:11:53,414 --> 00:11:55,715
You used to like Fillory.

181
00:11:56,558 --> 00:11:58,050
Yeah, I liked it.

182
00:11:58,152 --> 00:11:59,918
- I loved it...
- You got me into it, Julia!

183
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,054
I learned magic tricks
just to keep up with you.

184
00:12:02,156 --> 00:12:03,889
It was our thing.

185
00:12:03,991 --> 00:12:05,258
Yeah, it was our thing,

186
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,192
and it was fun, silly,
nerdy bullshit,

187
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,827
and it got us through
high school.

188
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:10,496
I guess I'm just a silly,
bullshit nerd, then?

189
00:12:10,598 --> 00:12:11,597
Hey, I'm not saying...

190
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:12,931
Which never seemed to bother you

191
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:15,234
until right around the
second you met James.

192
00:12:15,336 --> 00:12:17,603
I know where you
were all weekend...

193
00:12:17,705 --> 00:12:20,005
at the hospital.

194
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:21,540
No.

195
00:12:21,643 --> 00:12:25,444
You feel exactly like
you did the last time.

196
00:12:25,546 --> 00:12:27,680
Life is raw.
Everybody medicates.

197
00:12:27,782 --> 00:12:31,016
No, life is starting...
for real.

198
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:33,619
Look, I am just saying
that you are good

199
00:12:33,721 --> 00:12:35,621
at so much stuff.

200
00:12:35,723 --> 00:12:37,623
Pick something...

201
00:12:37,725 --> 00:12:39,358
please.

202
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,360
Start living your life.

203
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:48,434
Look, I got to go meet James.

204
00:12:52,006 --> 00:12:54,307
I love you. Call me, okay?

205
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,907
Great.

206
00:14:53,947 --> 00:14:56,824
TO EXAM

207
00:15:40,307 --> 00:15:42,441
Quentin Coldwater?

208
00:15:49,316 --> 00:15:50,916
I'm Eliot.

209
00:15:51,018 --> 00:15:53,251
You're late.

210
00:15:53,354 --> 00:15:55,220
Follow me.

211
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:58,858
Okay. Hey...

212
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,694
- Di... Where am I?
- Upstate New York.

213
00:16:01,796 --> 00:16:03,529
Upstate, but I was just...

214
00:16:03,631 --> 00:16:04,930
Hey.

215
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:07,099
Okay, what... what
is this place?

216
00:16:07,201 --> 00:16:08,934
Brakebills University.

217
00:16:09,036 --> 00:16:11,303
You've been offered a
preliminary exam for entry

218
00:16:11,405 --> 00:16:12,972
into the graduate program.

219
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:15,140
Am I hallucinating?

220
00:16:15,901 --> 00:16:19,612
If you were, how would
asking me help?

221
00:16:20,848 --> 00:16:23,682
Come on, or you'll miss it.

222
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:30,088
Late!

223
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,790
Be seated.

224
00:16:38,032 --> 00:16:39,598
Welcome.

225
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:44,069
You may address me as Dean.

226
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:45,738
I know you have questions.

227
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,273
They will be answered in time.

228
00:16:48,375 --> 00:16:51,109
Now your only job

229
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:55,480
is to pass the
examination before you.

230
00:16:56,951 --> 00:16:58,651
Begin.

231
00:17:13,968 --> 00:17:16,001
Sorry.

232
00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:24,509
I know that. I know that.

233
00:17:30,384 --> 00:17:33,052
I...

234
00:17:36,991 --> 00:17:39,391
Please report to this next room
for your final examination.

235
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:40,826
Thank you.

236
00:17:40,928 --> 00:17:43,062
Next.

237
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:46,031
Please report to this next room
for your final examination.

238
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:47,700
Thank you.

239
00:17:51,939 --> 00:17:54,306
- Jules.
- Oh, my God. Q?

240
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:56,742
Oh, my God.

241
00:17:56,844 --> 00:17:58,043
How did you get here?

242
00:17:58,145 --> 00:18:00,145
Well, I can't...
really explain that.

243
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:01,647
No, me neither. It was so weird.

244
00:18:01,749 --> 00:18:02,848
I-I-I went into an elevator,

245
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,516
and then I got out
of the elevator.

246
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:06,384
- Thank God. Thank God.
- Thank God what?

247
00:18:06,487 --> 00:18:07,987
No, thank God that
you're confused too.

248
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:09,755
I just... I just started
these new meds today,

249
00:18:09,857 --> 00:18:11,156
and I thought maybe...

250
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:13,659
Stop talking, please.
Stay focused.

251
00:18:14,561 --> 00:18:16,428
You've just been
given an examination

252
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,530
of your magical aptitude.

253
00:18:18,633 --> 00:18:20,232
"Magical"?

254
00:18:20,334 --> 00:18:22,200
We had reason to believe
you possess certain...

255
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:23,669
nascent abilities.

256
00:18:23,771 --> 00:18:25,270
Okay.

257
00:18:25,372 --> 00:18:28,507
I mean, I used to think that...

258
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:30,743
And perhaps you did at one time.

259
00:18:30,845 --> 00:18:33,211
Regrettably, you failed
the written exam.

260
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:35,881
I'm here to prepare
you to go home.

261
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:39,051
- What?
- It's all right.

262
00:18:39,153 --> 00:18:41,720
We'll provide an alibi
for your missing time.

263
00:18:41,822 --> 00:18:44,289
That test was crazy.
Any sane person...

264
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:46,291
I mean, all the questions
kept changing.

265
00:18:46,393 --> 00:18:47,960
- Be that as it may...
- No!

266
00:18:48,062 --> 00:18:50,228
Don't you want students
who make actual inquiry

267
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,497
instead of just
accepting like sheep?

268
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:58,203
I'm sorry.

269
00:18:58,305 --> 00:19:00,773
Can I start over?

270
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,708
Please?

271
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:06,045
I can't just go to Yale if
I know this place exists.

272
00:19:06,147 --> 00:19:08,213
Which is why I'm
going to make sure

273
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:10,649
that you don't remember a thing.

274
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:30,602
This won't hurt a bit.

275
00:19:31,311 --> 00:19:33,238
Quentin...

276
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:37,442
Let's see some magic.

277
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,998
No...

278
00:20:00,101 --> 00:20:03,635
magic, real magic.

279
00:20:03,738 --> 00:20:05,670
Please.

280
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:12,344
Okay.

281
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,153
Quentin...

282
00:20:21,255 --> 00:20:23,722
do you like this place?

283
00:20:23,824 --> 00:20:26,191
You have a gut feeling that...

284
00:20:26,293 --> 00:20:28,493
it's something special?

285
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:31,730
You want to go back to Columbia?

286
00:20:31,832 --> 00:20:35,634
That pointless, miasmic
march to death

287
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:37,002
you call life?

288
00:20:37,104 --> 00:20:39,872
Family that never calls

289
00:20:39,974 --> 00:20:42,507
and friends that
don't really get you

290
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:45,077
and feeling alone and wrong

291
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:48,147
until it crushes you?

292
00:20:48,249 --> 00:20:50,315
No.

293
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:54,653
Then quit dicking around!

294
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:56,388
Stop it.

295
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:59,591
Do some goddamn magic!

296
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:01,226
I said stop it!

297
00:21:04,114 --> 00:21:06,765
Oh, my God.

298
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:18,576
Holy shit. I'm doing this.

299
00:22:01,303 --> 00:22:03,421
I wouldn't.

300
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:06,325
Playing with time is
such difficult magic.

301
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:07,726
You'll just make it worse.

302
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:09,895
Jane Chatwin...

303
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:12,998
from the books.

304
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,900
Make what worse?

305
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:17,769
And it won't stop him coming.

306
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,540
- Who?
- The Beast.

307
00:22:22,642 --> 00:22:24,542
You're in the school.

308
00:22:24,644 --> 00:22:26,511
He's going to find you.

309
00:22:26,613 --> 00:22:28,413
You're the one he wants.

310
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:30,282
You have to learn.

311
00:22:30,384 --> 00:22:31,716
Learn what? What are you...

312
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:33,886
Look down.

313
00:22:33,988 --> 00:22:36,288
You're on the garden path.

314
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,023
Stay on, the Beast
will kill you,

315
00:22:38,125 --> 00:22:40,192
kill everyone.

316
00:22:40,294 --> 00:22:43,461
Step off the path or...

317
00:23:28,675 --> 00:23:31,643
Magic is real.

318
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:34,146
But you've gathered
that, haven't you?

319
00:23:34,248 --> 00:23:35,513
Have I?

320
00:23:35,615 --> 00:23:37,449
Three-year program,
graduate-level studies,

321
00:23:37,551 --> 00:23:38,783
program begins immediately.

322
00:23:38,885 --> 00:23:40,352
How did you find me?

323
00:23:41,602 --> 00:23:42,620
Globes.

324
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:45,523
Sense magic... it's
not always right,

325
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,426
so we test it.

326
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:49,428
How... how did my friend do...
Julia?

327
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:50,929
I'm afraid she
didn't make the cut.

328
00:23:51,031 --> 00:23:53,465
And my apologies for
the rocky road.

329
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:55,968
We certainly didn't intend
for Bob to die on you.

330
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,826
The alumni guy?

331
00:23:58,026 --> 00:23:59,504
He works for you?

332
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:02,841
- Was he murdered?
- Snuck a box of Oreos.

333
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:05,177
Magicians can't eat Oreos?

334
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,879
Diabetics can't have Oreos.

335
00:24:07,982 --> 00:24:11,216
And the paramedic who...

336
00:24:11,318 --> 00:24:13,518
gave me "Fillory: Book Six"?

337
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,189
Right. A scout...
freelance, sort of.

338
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:18,690
Any more questions?

339
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:21,793
I've got another...
24 of you today.

340
00:24:23,582 --> 00:24:26,531
Okay...

341
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:29,067
So "be a magician"?

342
00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:31,336
Is that illegal or...?

343
00:24:31,438 --> 00:24:33,405
Are you guys trying to
take over the world or...?

344
00:24:33,507 --> 00:24:36,208
This school exists for a
single and timeless purpose...

345
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,043
to reveal your innate abilities

346
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:39,811
and hone them to the
highest degree.

347
00:24:39,913 --> 00:24:42,014
Now, what you do with it after
that is entirely up to you.

348
00:24:42,116 --> 00:24:44,316
If you want to take
over the world,

349
00:24:44,418 --> 00:24:47,386
we don't teach that,
but give it a go.

350
00:24:47,488 --> 00:24:50,755
Quentin, I need an answer.

351
00:24:58,032 --> 00:24:59,864
Friends and family will be
given the exciting news

352
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:02,534
of your early acceptance to a
prestigious master's program,

353
00:25:02,636 --> 00:25:04,702
and with a little illusion work,

354
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:07,872
all their questions
will be answered.

355
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:10,975
Good. Now, your meds.

356
00:25:12,546 --> 00:25:15,747
Quentin, you haven't
been depressed.

357
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:18,583
You've been alone.

358
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:20,519
And you are not crazy.

359
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,421
You're angry.

360
00:25:22,523 --> 00:25:24,122
And you are correct.

361
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,291
Everyone...

362
00:25:26,393 --> 00:25:28,260
everyone medicates...

363
00:25:28,362 --> 00:25:30,529
out there.

364
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:34,399
Here, we hope you won't need to.

365
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,550
Are you my...

366
00:25:55,689 --> 00:25:57,655
What up, roomie?

367
00:26:02,115 --> 00:26:04,329
Hey, I had a... Okay...
I had a...

368
00:26:04,364 --> 00:26:06,264
notebook right here. "Fillory
and Further: Book Six."

369
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,665
- Did...
- And you what?

370
00:26:07,701 --> 00:26:09,367
You think I stole it?

371
00:26:09,403 --> 00:26:12,337
Some dumb-ass kid's book?

372
00:26:12,372 --> 00:26:14,005
Why do you have all
that nerd-boy dragon

373
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,574
porn shit, anyway... are you 12?

374
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:17,275
Quentin!

375
00:26:17,311 --> 00:26:19,211
This is the interruption
you've been waiting for.

376
00:26:19,246 --> 00:26:22,514
Hi. I'm Margo.

377
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:26,218
This is him.

378
00:26:26,253 --> 00:26:28,953
He's not that cute.

379
00:26:28,989 --> 00:26:33,191
So first years live
in these dorms.

380
00:26:33,227 --> 00:26:35,594
Then, depending on your talent,

381
00:26:35,629 --> 00:26:37,395
you go to the house
with your emphasis.

382
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:39,897
Or you flunk out, in
which case, bye-bye.

383
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:42,200
But you wouldn't care
'cause you won't remember.

384
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:47,405
Good morning, professors.

385
00:26:47,441 --> 00:26:50,308
Physical kids, telekinesis,

386
00:26:50,344 --> 00:26:54,112
move shit, lift
shit, most can fly.

387
00:26:54,148 --> 00:26:56,714
Also, magnificent partiers.

388
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:59,050
Do not come by our house if
you have anything important

389
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:00,685
to do the next morning.

390
00:27:02,689 --> 00:27:05,990
Then there's
illusions, healing...

391
00:27:06,617 --> 00:27:07,725
nature.

392
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:10,195
Knowledge.

393
00:27:17,003 --> 00:27:20,071
Psychics... you
know what they are?

394
00:27:20,384 --> 00:27:21,072
Losers.

395
00:27:21,107 --> 00:27:23,642
Okay, we heard that.

396
00:27:23,677 --> 00:27:25,410
Eat shit, Eliot.

397
00:27:25,445 --> 00:27:27,379
Like I said.

398
00:27:31,051 --> 00:27:33,685
- What? Who are they?
- Don't.

399
00:27:33,787 --> 00:27:36,821
- You'll scare the child.
- Maybe he should be scared.

400
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:39,591
You're so dramatic.

401
00:27:39,693 --> 00:27:42,494
That is what's left of
the third-year class.

402
00:27:42,596 --> 00:27:46,097
Were 20, now 4.
No one knows why.

403
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,667
They're just gone?

404
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:52,370
- Rumor has it, killed.
- Or flunked or got bored

405
00:27:52,472 --> 00:27:55,273
or died 16 perfectly natural deaths.
Whatever.

406
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:57,509
We all signed this waiver.
I hope you read yours.

407
00:27:57,611 --> 00:28:00,278
It says, "Spellwork is not
unlikely to murder you,

408
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:03,381
and, if so... well."

409
00:28:03,483 --> 00:28:05,049
So stay on the garden path, kid.

410
00:28:05,151 --> 00:28:07,352
Yeah.

411
00:28:07,454 --> 00:28:09,053
Wait. did you say
"the garden path"?

412
00:28:09,155 --> 00:28:11,523
Yeah, enough maudlin blah.

413
00:28:11,625 --> 00:28:13,291
Let's go find something
magic to smoke.

414
00:28:17,631 --> 00:28:20,064
At the exam,

415
00:28:20,166 --> 00:28:24,302
each of you did magic.

416
00:28:24,862 --> 00:28:28,864
What was inside you was coaxed.

417
00:28:28,966 --> 00:28:33,202
The question is, who
can grow this magic...

418
00:28:33,304 --> 00:28:36,072
into something more?

419
00:28:36,174 --> 00:28:38,107
Who can be a magician?"

420
00:28:41,112 --> 00:28:42,978
Alice, please.

421
00:28:57,161 --> 00:28:58,627
Looks serious.

422
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,029
Please...

423
00:29:00,131 --> 00:29:02,064
an artist is at work.

424
00:29:54,819 --> 00:29:57,019
The answer is yes.

425
00:29:57,121 --> 00:30:00,422
Until you pass out, and then
again when you wake up.

426
00:30:00,524 --> 00:30:04,626
- Did you just read my...
- Nah, it's just a guess.

427
00:30:30,312 --> 00:30:32,487
One of those every year.

428
00:30:32,589 --> 00:30:34,857
- One of what?
- Overachiever.

429
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:37,893
Shy, yet knows they're
smarter than everyone,

430
00:30:37,995 --> 00:30:40,329
therefore everyone hates them.

431
00:30:40,431 --> 00:30:42,898
Yeah, Alice is, like...

432
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,466
I don't know how she does it.

433
00:30:44,568 --> 00:30:46,202
That's Alice Quinn?

434
00:30:46,304 --> 00:30:49,171
Yeah, don't bother trying
to compare yourself.

435
00:30:49,273 --> 00:30:52,474
I heard she comes from a
whole family of magicians.

436
00:30:52,576 --> 00:30:55,577
It's good to be aware the
world is inherently unfair.

437
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,512
Act accordingly.

438
00:30:57,614 --> 00:31:01,416
Hey, Alice, come join us.

439
00:31:01,518 --> 00:31:03,919
Make some friends.
Take a load off.

440
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:09,024
Poor, little magic girl.

441
00:31:25,743 --> 00:31:28,377
Hey, Alice.

442
00:31:28,479 --> 00:31:30,545
Look, my friends...

443
00:31:30,647 --> 00:31:31,713
earlier, they were...
they were just...

444
00:31:31,815 --> 00:31:35,550
Cruel? Unoriginal?

445
00:31:35,652 --> 00:31:38,420
Yeah. Sorry.

446
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:40,256
Just...

447
00:31:40,358 --> 00:31:43,458
Look, honestly... it's...
it's my fault

448
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,361
that they said that.

449
00:31:45,462 --> 00:31:47,396
They saw how jealous I am,

450
00:31:47,498 --> 00:31:49,464
and... you're the best.

451
00:31:49,566 --> 00:31:50,732
It's easy for you.

452
00:31:50,834 --> 00:31:52,801
- No, I study.
- Then you get it.

453
00:31:52,904 --> 00:31:54,236
I barely...

454
00:31:55,639 --> 00:31:57,973
I'm terrified I'm
gonna get kicked out.

455
00:31:58,075 --> 00:32:00,042
I need this place,

456
00:32:00,144 --> 00:32:02,711
and I never had friends
or parents who under...

457
00:32:02,813 --> 00:32:06,282
Look, my parents are
useless, crazy people

458
00:32:06,384 --> 00:32:08,384
who never taught me a
drop of magic, okay?

459
00:32:08,485 --> 00:32:09,985
So, if you think that my family

460
00:32:10,087 --> 00:32:12,955
is some sort of advantage,
you've been misinformed.

461
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:14,723
There, is there
anything else I can do

462
00:32:14,825 --> 00:32:16,358
to make you feel better,
or are you good?

463
00:32:18,296 --> 00:32:20,329
Sorry. I just got your email.

464
00:32:20,431 --> 00:32:21,964
Cell phone's aren't
working up here.

465
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:25,267
- My fifth email.
- Sorry. I was working.

466
00:32:25,369 --> 00:32:26,835
You just tell me
what you meant by...

467
00:32:26,938 --> 00:32:28,070
I mean not herself.

468
00:32:28,172 --> 00:32:31,340
I mean barely talks
to me, not eating.

469
00:32:31,442 --> 00:32:33,608
She looks like a goddamn ghost.

470
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:35,744
She's not Julia.

471
00:32:35,846 --> 00:32:37,112
Why? What happened?

472
00:32:37,214 --> 00:32:39,448
If I knew, would I
need high and mighty

473
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,250
mega-genius you back here?

474
00:32:41,352 --> 00:32:43,585
It's her birthday. I'm
sure you forgot that too.

475
00:32:43,687 --> 00:32:45,421
I'm throwing a party.

476
00:32:45,522 --> 00:32:47,923
- Okay. Party. Good.
- Oh, party?

477
00:32:48,025 --> 00:32:51,026
- Oh, we're coming.
- No, it's not...

478
00:32:51,128 --> 00:32:53,462
Yeah, you go back out there to
the great, big, boring world,

479
00:32:53,564 --> 00:32:55,431
you'll never find your
way back without us.

480
00:32:55,532 --> 00:32:57,032
Trust.

481
00:32:57,134 --> 00:32:58,867
So is it black-tie or...

482
00:33:05,542 --> 00:33:07,009
This is super risqué.

483
00:33:07,111 --> 00:33:09,044
- That's better.
- Super risqué.

484
00:33:09,146 --> 00:33:12,147
All right. Okay. What is this?

485
00:33:12,249 --> 00:33:15,284
It is a... "Screwnacorn."

486
00:33:15,386 --> 00:33:17,286
Q! Holy shit!

487
00:33:17,388 --> 00:33:19,455
- Back from the wars.
- Hey.

488
00:33:19,556 --> 00:33:23,292
Hey. Hey.

489
00:33:23,394 --> 00:33:25,127
- Hey.
- Hey.

490
00:33:25,229 --> 00:33:29,965
- It's really good to see you.
- You too.

491
00:33:35,239 --> 00:33:37,139
Yeah.

492
00:33:41,345 --> 00:33:43,712
Scotch, neat.

493
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:46,815
Saw the balloons over there.

494
00:33:46,917 --> 00:33:49,684
Happy birthday.

495
00:33:49,786 --> 00:33:52,154
Or not.

496
00:33:52,256 --> 00:33:54,990
Yep. So go jump off a cliff.

497
00:33:55,092 --> 00:33:56,625
Thanks.

498
00:34:19,316 --> 00:34:22,518
I need you to tell them
they were wrong about me.

499
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:24,953
- Who?
- Brakebills.

500
00:34:25,056 --> 00:34:27,556
Say "What's Brakebills?"
And I will stab you.

501
00:34:27,658 --> 00:34:31,693
Tell them to test me again.

502
00:34:31,795 --> 00:34:35,130
- H-how did you...
- Remember?

503
00:34:35,232 --> 00:34:37,766
I don't know.

504
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:39,801
Maybe I'm a mutant.

505
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:44,106
Or maybe...

506
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:46,641
I wouldn't let myself forget.

507
00:35:04,595 --> 00:35:07,062
They'll just wipe
your memory again.

508
00:35:07,164 --> 00:35:08,763
I should be there.

509
00:35:08,865 --> 00:35:10,466
What happened to
should be at Yale?

510
00:35:10,568 --> 00:35:12,134
That was before I knew
there was something else.

511
00:35:12,236 --> 00:35:14,970
Who cares about business school?
Would you?

512
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:17,906
You have to be able
to do certain things.

513
00:35:18,008 --> 00:35:20,809
God, were you always this smug?

514
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,946
Watch.

515
00:35:45,068 --> 00:35:48,370
You have no idea how
long it took me.

516
00:35:48,472 --> 00:35:50,405
To find a spell that was real.

517
00:35:52,376 --> 00:35:54,676
- Yeah, it's real.
- Yeah, because I'm a magician.

518
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:56,478
Not necessarily.

519
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,347
There's a... there's
just stuff out there.

520
00:35:58,449 --> 00:36:00,015
There's a lot of nothing spells

521
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:01,716
that people don't even
know they're doing.

522
00:36:01,818 --> 00:36:03,185
You go online, and there's
a video of George Bush

523
00:36:03,287 --> 00:36:05,020
they keep taking down,
and he's drunk,

524
00:36:05,122 --> 00:36:06,988
and he's laughing, he's
making magic air ripples.

525
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:08,857
And your point is?

526
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:11,460
It doesn't mean you
have potential.

527
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:17,299
I'm sorry, but they would know.

528
00:36:17,401 --> 00:36:19,968
No, they missed it.
I know that I...

529
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:22,504
No, you know that you
don't want to fail.

530
00:36:22,606 --> 00:36:24,906
What?

531
00:36:25,008 --> 00:36:26,808
- It's not about that.
- Are you sure, Jules?

532
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:28,843
Because you can do
everything else.

533
00:36:32,716 --> 00:36:34,949
It's really okay if
this is not your thing.

534
00:36:38,922 --> 00:36:40,589
You're hurting yourself,

535
00:36:40,691 --> 00:36:43,925
and you're not okay.

536
00:36:44,027 --> 00:36:46,895
They cut off my life.

537
00:36:48,432 --> 00:36:50,465
Your life is here.

538
00:37:01,545 --> 00:37:04,346
- We got to go.
- How's my hair?

539
00:37:04,448 --> 00:37:05,980
Good.

540
00:37:50,628 --> 00:37:51,826
Hi.

541
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:04,606
How does it feel to know that...

542
00:38:04,708 --> 00:38:06,675
I can do whatever I want to you?

543
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,220
Awesome.

544
00:38:23,661 --> 00:38:25,594
I knew it.

545
00:38:25,696 --> 00:38:28,163
What the hell was that? What...

546
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:31,232
what are you, some kind
of crazy, psycho rapist?

547
00:38:31,335 --> 00:38:33,168
Hey, no.

548
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:36,070
No. I would never.

549
00:38:36,173 --> 00:38:38,340
I swear. I...

550
00:38:38,442 --> 00:38:41,943
I just needed to see
if I was right.

551
00:38:42,045 --> 00:38:44,579
Oh, you thought the school

552
00:38:44,682 --> 00:38:46,915
was the only place
to track the gift?

553
00:38:47,017 --> 00:38:50,819
We've been watching you
for quite a while now.

554
00:38:55,726 --> 00:38:57,826
Who's "we"?

555
00:39:15,278 --> 00:39:17,446
Hello? Do you need...

556
00:39:17,548 --> 00:39:18,847
Do you need help?

557
00:39:23,253 --> 00:39:25,153
What the...?

558
00:39:38,235 --> 00:39:40,301
Funny thing about Fillory...

559
00:39:40,404 --> 00:39:42,203
you don't really
decide when to go.

560
00:39:42,305 --> 00:39:45,507
It decides... if you deserve to.

561
00:39:45,609 --> 00:39:47,576
You haven't listened, Quentin.

562
00:39:47,678 --> 00:39:49,911
You stuck firm to that path.

563
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:52,414
It's going to kill you.
Do you understand?

564
00:39:52,516 --> 00:39:53,849
No, I don't understand.

565
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:56,551
Stop talking, you child.

566
00:39:57,921 --> 00:40:00,922
Look, I know you
like Brakebills.

567
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,924
I know you feel you
finally belong,

568
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:04,893
but that place isn't the point.

569
00:40:04,995 --> 00:40:06,327
You won't be there long.

570
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:07,596
Shut up. This is a dream,

571
00:40:07,698 --> 00:40:10,064
and you are a fictional,
English schoolgirl

572
00:40:10,166 --> 00:40:11,433
stuck in my head from a book.

573
00:40:11,535 --> 00:40:13,101
You know I'm not.

574
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:15,904
Look, Brakebills is the first
place that feels right to me

575
00:40:16,006 --> 00:40:18,707
that is not literally
a fairy tale.

576
00:40:18,809 --> 00:40:20,609
Brakebills is a tool.

577
00:40:20,711 --> 00:40:22,844
You feel right because you're
starting toward your destiny.

578
00:40:22,946 --> 00:40:24,345
That's all.

579
00:40:24,448 --> 00:40:27,181
Quit clinging.
Start questioning.

580
00:40:27,284 --> 00:40:29,418
Seek real answers that
will help you fight!

581
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,453
All right, back off.

582
00:40:35,091 --> 00:40:38,293
I know that symbol. What is it?

583
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:40,796
Find out, won't you?

584
00:40:57,639 --> 00:41:01,049
Hey... You were looking for something
in the cafe the other day.

585
00:41:01,151 --> 00:41:02,651
- There was a page with a symbol.
- Go away.

586
00:41:02,753 --> 00:41:05,987
Wait.

587
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:07,923
What does that mean?

588
00:41:09,526 --> 00:41:10,659
How did you get this?

589
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:13,495
I'll tell you if you tell me.

590
00:41:20,704 --> 00:41:22,136
Okay, fine.

591
00:41:22,238 --> 00:41:25,406
Tonight, 10:00 p.m., meet
me at the Admin Building.

592
00:41:25,509 --> 00:41:27,408
And bring an
Estonian-English dictionary.

593
00:41:27,511 --> 00:41:29,143
What does it mean?

594
00:41:31,849 --> 00:41:34,115
"Contact the other side."

595
00:41:34,217 --> 00:41:36,918
The other side? What,
like séance shit?

596
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,286
Summoning,
technically, but, yes.

597
00:41:38,388 --> 00:41:39,788
Right. Summoning, of course.

598
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:41,289
Yeah, when I'm trying
to contact the dead,

599
00:41:41,391 --> 00:41:43,124
I like to summon them
whenever possible.

600
00:41:43,226 --> 00:41:44,659
Yeah, that's the plan.

601
00:41:44,761 --> 00:41:45,961
As soon as we get the
book that I need

602
00:41:46,062 --> 00:41:47,362
that apparently got
pulled off the shelves

603
00:41:47,464 --> 00:41:49,364
- two years ago.
- Pulled as in locked up?

604
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:50,799
It's in the Dean's
private collection.

605
00:41:50,901 --> 00:41:52,433
Which means it needs
to be stolen, right?

606
00:41:52,536 --> 00:41:54,769
Okay...

607
00:41:54,872 --> 00:41:57,839
Look, I-I really... I don't
want to get kicked out.

608
00:41:57,941 --> 00:41:59,474
And I really don't
want to be the guy

609
00:41:59,576 --> 00:42:01,175
who dies in the first ten
minutes of the movie

610
00:42:01,277 --> 00:42:02,511
because he's like,
"You know what?

611
00:42:02,613 --> 00:42:03,812
"Let's take out the Ouija board.

612
00:42:03,914 --> 00:42:05,313
What could possibly go wrong?"

613
00:42:05,415 --> 00:42:07,015
Do you want to
cheat off my labs?

614
00:42:07,117 --> 00:42:08,349
Do you want a tutor? Do you
want to get straight As?

615
00:42:08,451 --> 00:42:10,051
I can do that for you.

616
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:12,120
So just help me with this.

617
00:42:12,222 --> 00:42:13,488
Okay, for some reason,
you're involved,

618
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:15,156
so be involved!

619
00:42:35,913 --> 00:42:39,213
Hey, Etude number 8...
left or right hand?

620
00:42:43,153 --> 00:42:44,553
Yo, pacey, what's your deal?

621
00:42:47,457 --> 00:42:50,491
Nothing. I...

622
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:56,565
Look, hold that thought, okay?

623
00:42:56,667 --> 00:42:58,232
- I got to...
- Got to what?

624
00:42:58,334 --> 00:42:59,701
Hey, I'm all ears.

625
00:42:59,803 --> 00:43:02,037
Penny, don't be a douche. What?

626
00:43:02,138 --> 00:43:03,438
I can...

627
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:07,709
- Look, I hear voices.
- What, psychic?

628
00:43:07,811 --> 00:43:09,410
No, God, I hate that word.

629
00:43:09,512 --> 00:43:11,880
Okay, mind slut?

630
00:43:13,951 --> 00:43:17,218
Come on, Penny, you're
not the first I've met.

631
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,554
I mean, you're not even the
first to get in my pants,

632
00:43:19,656 --> 00:43:21,189
so...

633
00:43:21,291 --> 00:43:23,357
Look, so, I got to go
somewhere, all right?

634
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,226
I'm obviously coming with you.

635
00:43:35,572 --> 00:43:39,641
God.

636
00:43:39,743 --> 00:43:43,645
Great, well, that makes me
feel a whole lot less nervous.

637
00:43:45,015 --> 00:43:46,414
Nut up, will you?

638
00:43:46,516 --> 00:43:47,983
There's no such thing
as safe magic.

639
00:43:48,085 --> 00:43:49,250
You should know that, Quentin.

640
00:43:49,352 --> 00:43:50,986
Might as well take a risk.

641
00:43:51,088 --> 00:43:54,255
Great, well, if put
it like that...

642
00:43:54,357 --> 00:43:56,658
Who are we trying to contact?
It says we... we need a name.

643
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,893
Charlie.

644
00:43:58,996 --> 00:44:01,963
- And who's Charlie?
- My brother.

645
00:44:02,065 --> 00:44:04,833
He died. It'd be nice to say hi.

646
00:44:07,638 --> 00:44:10,304
What?

647
00:44:10,406 --> 00:44:13,441
- H-h-how did he die?
- Horribly, I assume...

648
00:44:13,543 --> 00:44:16,444
since no one will tell
me what happened.

649
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:21,950
All I know is that it
happened here at Brakebills

650
00:44:22,052 --> 00:44:24,152
five years ago.

651
00:44:24,254 --> 00:44:26,287
Did you think that I came here

652
00:44:26,389 --> 00:44:29,624
because I just love
magic so much?

653
00:44:30,994 --> 00:44:33,128
No.

654
00:44:33,229 --> 00:44:35,830
I need an answer.

655
00:44:35,932 --> 00:44:37,165
He deserves that.

656
00:44:37,267 --> 00:44:38,767
So can we just concentrate?

657
00:44:38,869 --> 00:44:41,169
We need to get this done by
exactly midnight, okay? So...

658
00:44:41,271 --> 00:44:43,772
Sorry. I mean...

659
00:44:43,874 --> 00:44:46,041
to hear that. I mean, I...

660
00:44:46,143 --> 00:44:48,877
Shit. No.

661
00:44:48,979 --> 00:44:50,845
What? No, this is good.

662
00:44:50,947 --> 00:44:52,480
This is all making sense.

663
00:44:52,582 --> 00:44:54,549
Yeah. No, it is.

664
00:44:54,651 --> 00:44:57,052
It's just we can do this.
It's just we can't do this.

665
00:44:57,154 --> 00:44:59,320
We need...

666
00:45:03,894 --> 00:45:06,561
Hi.

667
00:45:07,864 --> 00:45:10,531
- So...
- You got to be kidding me.

668
00:45:10,633 --> 00:45:12,400
We were sent here to
help these losers?

669
00:45:12,502 --> 00:45:14,035
Sent?

670
00:45:14,137 --> 00:45:15,870
- Wait. Who sent you?
- No one!

671
00:45:15,972 --> 00:45:19,240
Look, I got that you guys need
some extra hands or something.

672
00:45:19,342 --> 00:45:22,711
Yes, I can. Yes, I have.

673
00:45:22,813 --> 00:45:24,846
Yes, everything you
think is so boring,

674
00:45:24,948 --> 00:45:26,314
I replace it with dubstep.

675
00:45:26,416 --> 00:45:28,249
What's dubstep?

676
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:30,351
It says we need four people.

677
00:45:30,453 --> 00:45:33,487
"Each one a Magical Adept."

678
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:36,991
And here they are.

679
00:45:37,094 --> 00:45:38,659
Please, come sit down.

680
00:45:38,762 --> 00:45:40,729
This is perfect timing.

681
00:46:15,132 --> 00:46:17,232
Well...

682
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:20,835
I'm hungry.

683
00:46:22,472 --> 00:46:24,472
What? I am.

684
00:46:28,511 --> 00:46:31,012
Let us know if shit
gets exciting.

685
00:46:42,592 --> 00:46:44,993
I guess I'll start cleaning up.

686
00:47:27,704 --> 00:47:29,070
A few helpful rules...

687
00:47:29,172 --> 00:47:30,504
Don't demand, ask.

688
00:47:30,606 --> 00:47:33,041
Safety first. Be patient...

689
00:47:33,143 --> 00:47:34,542
nobody levels up in a day...

690
00:47:34,644 --> 00:47:36,744
and don't leave your
purse lying around.

691
00:47:38,548 --> 00:47:41,749
And this what exactly?

692
00:47:41,852 --> 00:47:44,152
This is the real world, babe.

693
00:47:56,166 --> 00:47:59,133
Always pay close
attention to the alloys.

694
00:47:59,236 --> 00:48:01,736
Iron has a... has a
neutral quality,

695
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:04,072
whereas silver and
gold have the effect

696
00:48:04,174 --> 00:48:07,742
of... magnifying the effects of
other components of the alloy

697
00:48:07,844 --> 00:48:09,610
and I would caution
you to test for this

698
00:48:09,712 --> 00:48:11,779
each time before...
before using a knife

699
00:48:11,882 --> 00:48:14,715
for... ritual work because...

700
00:48:14,817 --> 00:48:18,819
a spell can alter
the metal at...

701
00:48:18,922 --> 00:48:21,055
at a quantum level.

702
00:48:34,804 --> 00:48:37,338
From the...

703
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:41,175
famous German poet and...
and wizard...

704
00:48:57,627 --> 00:48:59,294
So, for instance...

705
00:48:59,396 --> 00:49:01,262
this first device...

706
00:51:27,643 --> 00:51:30,044
Quentin Coldwater...

707
00:51:31,381 --> 00:51:34,315
There you are.

Well, he's dead.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,450
I think he left
something for you.

You may address me as Dean.

the examination before you.

the written exam.

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,483
I can do whatever I want to you.

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,366
Awesome.

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,649
You thought the school is the
only place to track the gift?

15
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,882
We've been watching you
for quite a while now.

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,166
What does that mean?

17
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,641
Okay, for some reason you're
involved, so be involved.

18
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,484
It says we need four people.

19
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,722
Look, I gather you guys need
some extra hands or something.

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,290
Let us know
if shit gets exciting.

21
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,808
Quentin Coldwater.

22
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,163
There you are.

23
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,641
Mr. Coldwater.

24
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,641
Quentin.

25
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,207
Quentin?

26
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,361
Quentin!

27
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,082
Describe The Beast
that attacked you.

28
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,481
Uh...

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,564
How did it get in here?

30
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,289
Mr. Coldwater,
what did The Beast say to you?

31
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,643
How did it know your name?

32
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,121
So what is this place exactly,
besides a health hazard?

33
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,682
Time was, the finest meat
packing plant in town.

34
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,491
Yeah, it's a winner.

35
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,080
- Hey, that star on your arm...
- I earned it.

36
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,369
You will too, with effort,
whole sleeve of 'em.

37
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,050
So what does it mean?
Does it mean that...

38
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,202
You ask a lot of questions.

39
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,408
Yeah, I sure do.

40
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,161
Oh, my God, these are real?
Every one of them?

41
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,687
Guys, this is Julia.
Julia, my associates.

42
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,807
Holy shit, it's...

43
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,769
And that is...

44
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,205
I'm sorry,
what's your name, sweetie?

45
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,248
I'm Marina. I'm new.

46
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,971
Yeah, no kidding.
Everything up and running?

47
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,371
Yeah.

48
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,887
Julia, Marina. Grand tour.

49
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,367
Wait, so who were
those people exactly?

50
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,845
You seriously don't know?

51
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,048
What are you even doing here?

52
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,409
I don't know. I'm waiting for
something interesting to happen. You?

53
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,403
Magic is what I'm doing here.

54
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,847
They're hedge witches.
We're hedge witches.

55
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,524
Jesus, how are you even...

56
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,602
Girls, play nice.

57
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,486
So here is where we keep
all our ingredients and such.

58
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,050
Keeps them safe.

59
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,727
- It's a...
- Meat locker, or it was, anyway.

60
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,643
Now it is so well-stocked,

61
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,245
it's like the end
of the rainbow.

62
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,286
After you.

63
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,601
Hey!

64
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,845
Come on, open the door.

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,525
Hey!

66
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,329
Hey, don't be an asshole.

67
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,091
Open the door! Dude!

68
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,929
We were frozen.

69
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,964
Some kind of paralysis spell.

70
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,644
Took over the whole room.

71
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,126
Let's just nip
this all in the bud.

72
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,283
I already told you, the Dean
had something in his hand.

73
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,685
I don't know where
it went after that.

74
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,962
You can materialize objects?

75
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,603
I've been doing card
tricks half my life.

76
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,369
<i>I guess some of them
were disappearing.</i>

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
<font color="#0E7521">Ripped & Corrected By mstoll</font>

78
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,691
<i>Quentin...</i>

79
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,561
Take this.

80
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,281
Is he dead?

81
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,571
The Dean?

82
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,121
How did you know that spell?

83
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,170
Look, I know we're not supposed
to fire off battle magic, but...

84
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,486
I mean, come on.

85
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,523
Can we just get out
of this room soon?

86
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,681
Please?

87
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,971
<i>I know you want
to understand what happened.</i>

88
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,485
<i>Here's what I can say.</i>

89
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,849
We live in a world
that is one world among many.

90
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,924
<i>The Beast you saw was
from one such place.</i>

91
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,321
<i>We do not know the exact
nature of this entity,</i>

92
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,490
only that it was
powerful and malevolent.

93
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,289
Stop it!

94
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,362
<i>And we know that it is gone now.</i>

95
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,483
Wards and shields
protect Brakebills.

96
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,770
They are encoded to each authorized
person on campus and no one else.

97
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,251
We are investigating
how this Beast got through

98
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,243
and resetting everyone.

99
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,690
If someone is responsible
for this attack,

100
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,162
rest assured,
they will be expelled.

101
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,168
Classes are canceled tomorrow.

102
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,130
They will resume Wednesday.

103
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,605
There will be a quiz.

104
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,084
Alice.

105
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,366
Okay...

106
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,807
- Um...
- Don't.

107
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,609
Hey, we did that spell.

108
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,409
You don't get to say,
"Don't," okay?

109
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,084
If they find out...

110
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,049
There they are.

111
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,691
- Glad to see you, kid.
- Oh, you poor thing.

112
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,643
- Nurse?
- Are you okay?

113
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,128
No, it's okay, we're just
gonna get you a nice drink.

114
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,885
Jesus, you didn't tell me
you were dangerous.

115
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,243
Damn it.

116
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,765
And damn it.

117
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,403
Pretty sure my boyfriend's starting
to get curious where I am.

118
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,482
Oh, Jesus Christ,
it's cold.

119
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,449
We're stuck, and they're
trying to kill us, so...

120
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,284
They're not trying
to kill us, okay?

121
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,840
These people are not
murderers. Trust me.

122
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,445
How do you know that?

123
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,046
Because, they don't
have the balls for it.

124
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,727
It's like some sort
of hazing ritual, a test.

125
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,087
I'm sick of flunking
tests right now.

126
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,085
I'm gonna figure it out.

127
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,526
Nothing to see,
you louche little degenerates.

128
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,125
<i>Avada Kedavra.</i>

129
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,486
Whatever, Eliot.

130
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,601
Welcome to the Physical
Kids' Cottage.

131
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,444
It's the single best
place on campus

132
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,329
for a number of reasons
that will become clear

133
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,324
as soon as you taste
our signature cocktail.

134
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,765
I've got to...

135
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,365
Try on this dress I have.

136
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,920
It's perfect. It's made
exactly for those assets

137
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,367
you're hiding underneath
that pilgrim tent.

138
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,283
Yes, you must. Trust me.

139
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,521
<i>Après moi.</i>

140
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,161
On purpose?

141
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,527
Like, you guys
cast it, thinking,

142
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,682
"Oh, monster from another world.

143
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,444
"By all means, come on in."

144
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,841
So you messed up.

145
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,570
It's a little bit
bigger than messing up.

146
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,530
Than what? Than whatever blew
up the entire third year class?

147
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,807
There's a bad story
every few years around here.

148
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,166
I'm not sure that's avoidable.

149
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,126
Okay.

150
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,006
And if you confess...

151
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,650
- Then I'm done.
- Yeah.

152
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,050
Argh...

153
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,084
Before I got here,
I was in the hospital.

154
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,891
I have... Or I had...

155
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,089
I don't know, uh, this thing that I
couldn't shake where I felt like

156
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,767
because nothing was ever not gonna
be pointless and empty, then,

157
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,683
Uh, Why go on?

158
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,926
And then I got here, and...

159
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,450
It's amazing I survived
as long as I did

160
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,648
not knowing that
I was a Magician.

161
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,921
I can't go back.

162
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,126
So, okay.

163
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,765
There is a spell, uh, if they question
you, so they can't read your minds.

164
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,649
I'll write it down.

165
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,370
It's bulletproof.

166
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,521
Thank you.

167
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,448
Now, can you just
help me live with myself?

168
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,811
Okay,
I'm gonna tell you something

169
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,087
deep and dark and personal now.

170
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,685
Ready? Good.
I killed someone.

171
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,321
What?

172
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,522
I was 14. He was this...

173
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,527
He beat me up.

174
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,001
So I'm walking on the street
eating a candy bar,

175
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,323
'cause by then I already ate my
feelings at a professional level,

176
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,449
and I saw him crossing over.

177
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,002
And there was this bus coming.

178
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,048
I barely thought the thought.

179
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,481
Barn.

180
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,244
I knew immediately
what I'd done, that it was me.

181
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,322
My nose literally
started bleeding.

182
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,048
Logan Kinear died instantly and I
ruined my favorite button-down.

183
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,925
And that is the story of how I
discovered I was telekinetic.

184
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,809
If you're trying to tell
me that it gets better...

185
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,120
Oh, God, no. No, it doesn't.

186
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,449
I'm trying to tell you,
you are not alone here.

187
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,569
Funny little irony
they don't tell you,

188
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,564
magic doesn't come from talent.

189
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,041
It comes from pain.

190
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:58,647
So, do you know what it was,
the thing that attacked you?

191
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,366
- No, I have no idea.
- Oh.

192
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,445
I thought you might be familiar

193
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,921
with some pretty crazy shit
since your family.

194
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,008
Yeah, no, my family's not...

195
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,889
- Right.
- Yeah.

196
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,041
I get it.

197
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,602
Mine too.

198
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,001
Pointless and toxic.

199
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,246
I didn't really learn
magic formally as a kid.

200
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,325
I heard you never got invited to
take the Brakebills entrance exam.

201
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,321
How'd you even find it?
You walked right in.

202
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,565
It's not that hard.

203
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,568
We're in the Bermuda Triangle
of upstate New York.

204
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,523
How'd you get through though?

205
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,690
The wards around the school
are fingerprinted.

206
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,921
You're a stranger.

207
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,851
My parents have alumni keys.

208
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,729
Which are supposed to be charmed

209
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,450
with McNaughton's Unstealable.

210
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,045
I stole one.

211
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,121
Hmm.

212
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,281
Um...

213
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,882
I just wanted to go to school.

214
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,885
Why do you care?

215
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,325
Curious.

216
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,521
Just 'cause...

217
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,365
I don't know.

218
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,965
I want to be
your friend, I guess.

219
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,531
I don't feel like you do.

220
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,330
I'm sorry, I should go.
Thank you.

221
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,931
There has to be something here.

222
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,049
Maybe the phone numbers
are, like, a code or...

223
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,650
That's too easy.

224
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,445
Come on.

225
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,441
Chop-chop.

226
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,648
There has to be something.
I mean...

227
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,641
Oh!

228
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,448
Is it...

229
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,170
Dead? Mmm-hmm, yeah.

230
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,969
But it was already dead,
so I don't know.

231
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,485
Oh, my God.

232
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,528
Jesus Christ,
they're gonna kill us.

233
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,483
Why did I sign up for this?
This is...

234
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,011
- Stop it, stop, okay?
- Okay, okay.

235
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,321
It's dead dead now, I think.

236
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,761
I don't know.

237
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,686
Calm down.
Jesus, guys, it's me.

238
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,046
Pete, is that you?

239
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,610
Howdy.

240
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,526
Oh, Pete, that's definitely a good
look for you, an improvement.

241
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,841
Why don't you join us in here?
I think Marina misses you.

242
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,285
Just let us out.

243
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,408
Don't be stupid.
You have to find your way out.

244
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,960
So this is a test, another test.

245
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,690
Look, if you can't
get through this,

246
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,969
you definitely can't deal with
what it takes to do what we do.

247
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,361
Do you want magic or not, Julia?

248
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,204
Did you look everywhere?

249
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,282
Fast, frostbite's gonna set in.

250
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,725
Asshole. Shit.

251
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,961
What did that mean?

252
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,611
Uh, where didn't we look?

253
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,287
Wait.

254
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,849
<i>"Une chaleur temporaire."</i>

255
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,011
Temporary warmth.

256
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,689
I was just researching.

257
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,921
Reading a kids' book?

258
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,161
What do you want from me, huh?

259
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,890
Jesus, we could not
have screwed up

260
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,405
that spell worse,
and we can't take it back,

261
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,249
and you don't even like me.

262
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,446
I don't know you.

263
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,726
I don't know you either,

264
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,009
except that we summoned some kind of
killer mothman from another world.

265
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,491
Yeah, there is that.

266
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,008
You should hate me right now.
I dragged you into this.

267
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,770
It's just you showed up
with that sigil on your hand,

268
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,763
and it was the same one that
was on the book that I needed,

269
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,764
and my brother,
his spirit, I mean,

270
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,842
sent you to help me contact him.

271
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,127
So, I'm not really sure
that that's what happened.

272
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,407
The thing on my hand,
the sigil,

273
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,883
uh, it appeared when
I was dreaming of Fillory.

274
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,805
Okay.

275
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,487
In my dream,
the sigil on my hand,

276
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,040
it came from Jane.

277
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,690
Chatwin. From Fillory.

278
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,331
Look, honestly, Quentin,
growing up,

279
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,880
the last thing I wanted
to do was read fantasy.

280
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,721
Okay. What if, um...

281
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,803
What if Fillory is real?

282
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,530
And I know that you think that
this is just about Charlie,

283
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,489
but I think maybe it's bigger,

284
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,086
because what came through that
mirror instead of Charlie,

285
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,845
it didn't exactly grow up
in the neighborhood.

286
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,411
Okay.

287
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,166
So what if it came from,
like, actual Fillory?

288
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,010
That's a leap, Quentin.

289
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,369
I mean, there are other worlds out
there, but Fillory is just fiction.

290
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,683
Oh, no, the uh,
Chatwins, they're real.

291
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,807
They lived next door
to the author.

292
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,291
He based the characters on them.

293
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,364
Jesus, how do you
not know any of this?

294
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,569
Is there, um, someplace on campus
we can to go to watch a video?

295
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,802
- Yeah.
- Good.

296
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,366
<i>After living next
door to the Chatwins for years</i>

297
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,283
<i>and writing stories
for young Jane and Martin,</i>

298
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,204
<i>when Martin Chatwin disappeared,</i>

299
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,203
<i>Christopher Plover
was devastated.</i>

300
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:19,286
<i>This was just one of a series of painful
events that haunted Christopher Plover.</i>

301
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,647
<i>It suffused his work with a
sense of melancholy and loss.</i>

302
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,123
<i>And the mystery of
Martin Chatwin's disappearance</i>

303
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,123
<i>was never solved.</i>

304
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,801
<i>Even more mysterious,</i>

305
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,405
<i>Martin's sister Jane disappeared</i>

306
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,970
<i>the following year.</i>

307
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,166
That's a lot of disappearing.

308
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,442
Yeah, I mean, that's kind of why
people are obsessed with the books,

309
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,569
'cause you have these kids walking
into clocks, uh, into other worlds,

310
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,801
and they're based on real kids,

311
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,803
and the real kids, uh, vanished.

312
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,564
You're saying that
Charlie vanished too...

313
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,244
No, no, no, no, no.
I don't know.

314
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,810
I don't know what happened
to Charlie or anyone.

315
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,167
I don't, uh, know.

316
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,131
I mean look, we called
something from another world.

317
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,806
I don't know, can that
really be a coincidence?

318
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,405
So what do we do?

319
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,604
Don't get caught.
I can't get kicked out.

320
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,966
I mean, I have to find out
what happened to him.

321
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:05,010
Yeah, I know, but...

322
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,525
What if Fillory is real?

323
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,923
Jesus, you don't understand how
mind-blowing that is. It's just like...

324
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,604
Do you want to
stay at Brakebills?

325
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,682
- Yes.
- Okay, so do I.

326
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,724
So let's just hide the evidence
and get our story straight.

327
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,847
Okay?

328
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,210
What, you're leaving?

329
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,123
- I'm gone.
- Come on.

330
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,488
Look, I know I don't
know you that well,

331
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,369
but I know you're not
the type to scare easy.

332
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,444
You want the truth? No sweat.

333
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,522
Hearing people's thoughts
is the least of my problems.

334
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,487
Couple lines, right mix of meds.

335
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,164
But you heard Quentin
and Alice in the lab.

336
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,401
No, I didn't.

337
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,165
There's this voice.

338
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,651
Everyone else comes
with a lot of static,

339
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,724
but him, he's clear
as a fucking bell.

340
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,250
Says he's a Magician.
That's...

341
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,043
That's all I know about him.

342
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,408
That and everything that he
taught me is real and it works.

343
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,686
Holy shit.

344
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,003
Let's just say life wasn't
exactly non-stop fun growing up.

345
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,162
That's why I love that voice.

346
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,961
Saved my ass so many times,
he's basically my only friend.

347
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,761
Yeah, right up until
he sent me to a lab to help,

348
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,003
and then that thing
walked in through the mirror.

349
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,686
- You were hearing The Beast?
- I was getting duped.

350
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,003
But, do they know?
I mean, Sunderland, anyone?

351
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,408
No, there's no point now.

352
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,687
But don't... Penny, don't go.

353
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,366
Come on. It's not your fault.

354
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,726
He tricked you.

355
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,041
Come on, don't be stupid.

356
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,202
Why would you leave
the only place with experts

357
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,805
that might actually
be able to help you with this?

358
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,206
Why do you care?

359
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,806
Look, I did
the spell too, Penny.

360
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,724
If you're guilty, I'm guilty.

361
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,961
You're guilty.

362
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,880
Okay, great,
let's jump off a bridge.

363
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,007
Kady.

364
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,926
I can't stand it.

365
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,367
Okay.

366
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,281
Go.

367
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,006
But...

368
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,971
Hey, since you're out anyway,

369
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,527
come do something stupid
with me before you go.

370
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,766
Come on.

371
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,688
Yeah, 'cause crushed rocks,

372
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,082
you see that in spells that have
a concentrated area of effect.

373
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,049
I'm sorry, you knew this and you
didn't want to say anything?

374
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,565
Okay, well,
I don't know what I know.

375
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,123
Years reading Internet crap and
accidentally poisoning myself twice,

376
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,561
and now I'm stuck
in a freezer with some bitch.

377
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,721
Well, you are.

378
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,043
What, did you figure you wanted
magic at your blow dry last week?

379
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,690
This is serious for some of us.

380
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,366
Okay, you know what? I'm not
interested in your personal issues.

381
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,603
Hey.

382
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,286
There was sand
in that paint can.

383
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,048
Yeah, and I'm gonna
need a knife and a bowl.

384
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,963
Okay.

385
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,804
And...

386
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,771
<i>"Graisse de l'animal...
De préférence de mouton."</i>

387
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,888
Animal fat. Mutton.

388
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,291
Maybe there's meat?

389
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,521
Come on, let's go before
we freeze our tits off.

390
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,484
This isn’t just some
lark to me, so you know.

391
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,564
No offense, okay, you just smell
a little Ivy League to me.

392
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,723
Yeah, well, it's 'cause I am.

393
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,609
I was.

394
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,250
Have you ever
heard of Brakebills?

395
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,169
Well, it's like this
secret Yale, but for magic.

396
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,241
What?

397
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,845
And you have to be able
to do magic to even get in.

398
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,365
Well, I can do magic.

399
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,090
Yeah, so can I.

400
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,440
And yet, somehow,
I flunked the entrance exam.

401
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,449
That doesn't seem right.
Either you can or you can't.

402
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,690
No, it's not right, and yet
they just left me behind.

403
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,683
I mean, seriously,
what do they expect, you know?

404
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,889
Magic is real and that's the thing,
and once you know that, you can't...

405
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,450
Nothing else matters.

406
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,803
Exactly.

407
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,927
It's like...

408
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:35,161
I know it's there.

409
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,687
It's everywhere, all around me,

410
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:43,209
a whole world
of power and beauty.

411
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,686
You can't unsee it.

412
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,851
You wake up for the first time.

413
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,001
Yeah.

414
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,327
Who are we kidding?

415
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,971
There's no meat in here.
We've checked everything.

416
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,525
No, no way, I cannot do that.

417
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,080
Mmm-mmm.
No, please do that.

418
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,651
<i>I let my old life
tie me to the tracks</i>

419
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,451
<i>I heard my best friend tell me</i>

420
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,966
<i>You can never go back</i>

421
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,764
<i>I spent my long years</i>

422
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,969
<i>Learning to get out of the way</i>

423
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,451
<i>I have been taught
to turn the other cheek</i>

424
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,969
<i>I get my back stabbed, buddy
to the end of the week</i>

425
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,201
<i>I only try to make it
to the end of the day</i>

426
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,966
<i>I've seen it break
so many before</i>

427
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,886
<i>I don't wanna stick
around here and watch anymore</i>

428
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,041
- Mmm.
- Oh...

429
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,088
Yo, this one looks bunk.

430
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,288
Well, it's not.
It's Emerson's Alloy.

431
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,249
Uh, alloy's rusting.

432
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,406
How do you know?

433
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,760
'Cause I know things.

434
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,888
Like this place...
What? It's a gold mine.

435
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,645
Look, you can't
run away from you.

436
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,645
And, well, I'm here,
and I'm amazing, so I mean...

437
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,925
I'll take it under
advisement, okay?

438
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,570
Hey.

439
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,244
No, leave us alone.

440
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,163
Gladly, we've got
to discuss, um...

441
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,246
There you are, Quentin and
Alice, and Penny and Kady.

442
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,402
You're exactly who
I was looking for.

443
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,684
I found the most interesting
thing buried in our woods.

444
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,081
Follow me.

445
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,162
We never got near
the mirror, I swear.

446
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,681
We were studying, that's all.

447
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,762
What language even is this?

448
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,050
Yes, I mean, sure, I touched it.

449
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,282
We all touched it.
I mean, I touched...

450
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,170
We were studying, so...

451
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,210
Look, I'm just trying
to make sense of this.

452
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,123
There's residue
all over this book,

453
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,487
including a summoning

454
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,562
we believe opened
the door to The Beast.

455
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,483
What did you say?

456
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,681
Nothing, I...

457
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,646
Don't look at me.

458
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,480
Look, I know
they're your friends.

459
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,123
Okay, at this point, I just have
to assume it was all of you.

460
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,168
Yeah, well, it wasn't.

461
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,289
Shut up and I'll
tell you, happily.

462
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,561
It's fine, let's go.

463
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,046
You're welcome, by the way.

464
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,206
What does that mean?

465
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,403
Quentin, can I see you, please?

466
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,845
Alice, you're free to go.

467
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,764
There's nothing I
can do in this moment

468
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,047
to stop the comet from crashing
into the earth, is there?

469
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,201
Hold On.

470
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,887
Uh...

471
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,047
What is this?

472
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,124
My books. I'm headed to return them.
You've heard, I assume.

473
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,964
Word travels fast
when your life's over.

474
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,246
Don't say that.

475
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,045
They're bringing
in a specialist.

476
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,442
Yeah, thanks. Ominous.

477
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,851
I'm sorry.

478
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,850
I don't know, I keep trying to tell
myself this is somehow better,

479
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,809
you know, not to know.

480
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,444
'Cause who would want
to know that magic exists

481
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,965
if there's nothing you can do
about it, you know,

482
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,804
if there's no one
to teach you or help you.

483
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,406
I don't know what to say.

484
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:21,051
Of course you don't, because
nobody would rather not know.

485
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,686
You don't see color and want
to go back to black and white.

486
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,281
You do not have to make
me feel better really,

487
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,600
we basically
just met each other.

488
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,729
Well, I bond fast.
Time is an illusion.

489
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,963
Look, don't go out
there and be the old you.

490
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,804
How, Eliot?

491
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,484
I go back there, and I'm...

492
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,170
I'm a depressed super nerd.

493
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,483
How about I find you,
and I don't say magic is real,

494
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,490
but I do seduce you,
and so lift your spirits

495
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,769
that life retains
its sparkle for decades.

496
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,609
Yeah, that sounds nice.
Thank you.

497
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,886
Okay.

498
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,284
Is there any way
not to get wiped?

499
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,169
I don't know.

500
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,050
I've heard of the specialist,
and all I can say is,

501
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,451
I hear they're very good.

502
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,850
<i>This is
Julia, little busy. Leave a message.</i>

503
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,287
Hey, it's Q.

504
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,567
<i>Look, I know when
we last met that, uh...</i>

505
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:33,521
<i>I'm sorry, Jules. I am.</i>

506
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,400
<i>I didn't know what it
must be like for you,</i>

507
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:42,327
<i>and I, um, I hope that
you are doing better.</i>

508
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,284
Oh, my God,
you're just going for it.

509
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,690
So, I got expelled, and they
are sending in a specialist

510
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:57,608
because the local brain wipe
guy is dead, and long story.

511
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,011
<i>Um...</i>

512
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,402
So if you remember or you figured
out why it didn't work on you,

513
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,084
I'd like to know that,
about now,

514
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,562
<i>because I need you to remind
me that magic is real.</i>

515
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,606
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

516
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,206
You know, without Brakebills,
it's just...

517
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,487
I'm lost and you're not.

518
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,730
Magic.

519
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,609
Okay.

520
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,682
Let's find a way
out of this shit hole.

521
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,446
You can't help and
I can't help you,

522
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,443
and it's just...

523
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,410
<i>To send
your message, press one.</i>

524
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,528
<i>To erase, press two.</i>

525
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,720
<i>Deleted.</i>

526
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,361
Hey!

527
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,921
You little piece of shit.

528
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,764
- You ratted me out.
- I told the truth.

529
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,330
- Not all of it.
- Oh, am I a fool?

530
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,845
Apparently not.

531
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,161
- Get off!
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

532
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,125
What the hell was that,
you maniac?

533
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,885
Hey! Step back, both of you!
Who shot off that spell?

534
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,803
- He did!
- I did.

535
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,291
Infirmary, both of you, now.

536
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,683
Figured it out.

537
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:01,287
The spell, or, you know, the whole
point, that there isn't one.

538
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,604
Not to get out of the room, not
to keep the door locked, nada.

539
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,170
Cute, Pete.

540
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,449
Oh, and scissors make a shitty
screwdriver, by the way.

541
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,601
Good for you.

542
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,887
Now you get why it
was so important.

543
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,883
Uh, to almost die for no reason?

544
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,362
To figure out that not
everything gets solved by magic.

545
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,363
Key fact if you
want to last the month.

546
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,568
You're not still debating letting
me into your club, are you?

547
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,722
Hey, I invited you.

548
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,521
No, you attacked me in a bar,
in a bathroom, on my birthday.

549
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,409
I'm done trying
to prove myself to you.

550
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,766
You weren't.

551
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,487
You were trying
to prove yourself to me.

552
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,609
That means level 50.

553
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,601
Um...

554
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,641
Uh...

555
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,802
Wait, so you were...

556
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,690
Top bitch in New York,
for starters.

557
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,444
Um, and this was...

558
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:07,046
Me discovering
how much I like you.

559
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,886
You are smart. You're passionate.
You question things.

560
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,450
You messed with my head!

561
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,045
Think about how much you
learned about how to do that

562
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,003
for when you're level 50.

563
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,408
- Hey, don't be mad.
- Don't be mad.

564
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,050
How am I supposed to trust you?

565
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,770
Why would you ever trust anyone?

566
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,889
I am willing to teach the right
people everything I know,

567
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,287
and I know a lot,

568
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,921
because I have certain
connections in certain places,

569
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,288
just like,
for instance, Brakebills.

570
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,764
Brakebills.

571
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,047
- You want a drink?
- Let's get a drink.

572
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,045
Might burn a little.

573
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,329
This is why you're not supposed to
throw this kind of magic around.

574
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,243
If you’re lucky, I can fix this.

575
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,731
You're lucky
you're not expelled.

576
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,648
That's actually...

577
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,921
Hold still, please.

578
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,729
- Pussy.
- Nobody asked you.

579
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,406
Me, the guy you
threw battle magic at?

580
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,170
Hey, have you heard of karma?

581
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,527
Well, sometimes it's instant.

582
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,364
You're welcome.

583
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,011
What is that? How did you...

584
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,764
Real Magicians
protect themselves.

585
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,960
Would somebody please
sign him out of here?

586
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,201
She's late.

587
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,520
She's coming.

588
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,604
Or she's just
done with your shit.

589
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,250
She doesn't have the option.

590
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,601
Finally.

591
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,041
Hey, look, that thing you wanted,
that charm or crystal or whatever?

592
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,963
The Emerson's Alloy Repellant?

593
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,371
Yeah, this guy I was with,
he grabbed it.

594
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,006
Look, I'll find you
another one, okay?

595
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,889
And more.

596
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,042
Here.

597
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,451
There's a ton
of good shit in there.

598
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,921
Listen to all that backpedaling.

599
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,968
I'll get it, okay?

600
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,522
Whatever you want.
I'll find you another one.

601
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,251
Great. You're
a sweet girl, Kady.

602
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,049
You're a heartless bitch.

603
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:31,203
I'm generous with you,
considering.

604
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,846
Get me everything on
this list, this week.

605
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,369
Thanks so much.

606
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,930
You better get back to bed, hon.

607
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,331
I'm sure you got
class in the morning.

608
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,203
- Hi.
- Oh...

609
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,126
Caught me where I'm not meant
to be, a terminal snooper.

610
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,966
How are you, Quentin?
I heard about the attack.

611
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,125
You were there the day
of the alumni interview.

612
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,725
You were a paramedic.

613
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,330
Call me Eliza.

614
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,562
I was there that day to make
sure that you got here.

615
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,281
Oh...

616
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,331
Well, uh, thank you,

617
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,404
but I kind of screwed that up.

618
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,001
Uh...

619
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,884
They're calling in a specialist.

620
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,760
He's supposed to, um, wipe it all
away like it never happened.

621
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,490
Mmm. That sounds...

622
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,490
Hmm...

623
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,411
You know,
I'm the specialist? Sorry.

624
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,531
Shall we sit?

625
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,011
Okay. Okay.

626
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,286
Okay.

627
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,530
Um, just before, um, can I...

628
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,883
Um, why did you
give me that book?

629
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,009
<i>Fillory and Further</i>, book six.

630
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,841
I thought you'd appreciate it.

631
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,251
I lost it.

632
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,560
Guess I was wrong.

633
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,642
No, you're not, I...

634
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,485
I need to read it.
I just, I can't find it.

635
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,608
Things with Fillory
are funny that way.

636
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,485
Is Fillory real?

637
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,211
Why even ask if you'll
just forget it again?

638
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,645
The books, they're just...

639
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,361
They always felt
realer than anything.

640
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,565
Then it's real.

641
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,404
That's not a real answer.

642
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,641
Shall we begin?

643
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,127
Okay, do it.

644
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,369
Oh, Quentin,
I am pleased!

645
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,241
What? Why?

646
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,800
You're a much better liar
than I expected you to be.

647
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,971
Can I level with you?

648
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,530
I wish you would.

649
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,443
You're not very remarkable.

650
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,929
You're smart, but no genius.

651
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,287
You do magic,
but nothing special.

652
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,766
And the worst is,
you're so eager to belong,

653
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,410
you even forget why you're here.

654
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,766
Why am I here?

655
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,363
You dreamed of it, didn't you?

656
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:47,082
Fillory, before the attack,
like a warning?

657
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,964
Yeah, how did you...

658
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,530
Because I've dreamed of it too.

659
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,126
And I've looked
into that Beast's eyes.

660
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,361
What?

661
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,049
Do you think you have a destiny?

662
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,971
Um, yes.

663
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,530
Yeah.

664
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,807
I used to believe that
crap too when I was young.

665
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,249
There is no destiny,
no born heroes.

666
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,207
I can't tell you why The Beast
came sniffing for you.

667
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,929
There's no reason
it should be you.

668
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:23,168
You can either step up
to it or not, it's up to you.

669
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,288
We'll just hope for the best.

670
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,526
Who are you?

671
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:31,889
Just another inadequate
Magician who's lost people.

672
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,370
So will you if you
don't get strong.

673
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,250
Learn fast, any means necessary.

674
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,408
Which is why I'm so pleased
to see you sitting there

675
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,721
like you don't have
an Emerson's in your pocket

676
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,842
to repel any spell
to wipe your mind.

677
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,285
Uh, you stole that.

678
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,691
Who stole it?

679
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,483
Relax, nobody's
taking your mind today.

680
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,841
We'll make something of you yet.

681
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,163
I'll tell the school
one more chance, probation.

682
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,765
They'll respect my call.

683
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,890
Don't make me regret it.

684
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:09,851
Don't hop back on the garden
path like some little lemming,

685
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:12,207
or I'll erase everything
and start you over entirely,

686
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,691
for your own good.

687
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,091
The garden path?

688
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,607
Everything's connected.
Don't over-think it.

689
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,770
<i>All of Bobby's flowers
going to stand up straight</i>

690
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,607
<i>All of Bobby's flowers
going to stand up straight</i>

691
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,207
Congratulations, Julia.
Big day.

692
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,762
First star. First of many.

693
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,205
Yeah.

694
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,651
<i>Bobby put the flowers in his mama's car</i>

695
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,404
This is just the beginning.

696
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:12,922
<i>And he knew that they
wouldn't have to drive too far</i>

697
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,570
Hope your bits are covered.

698
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,681
Coming in.

699
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,245
How are you, Henry?

700
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,361
I'm sorry.

701
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:57,647
I knew he'd come, but I swear
I didn't know so soon.

702
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,051
No one is ready.

703
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,724
We need more time,

704
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,530
and a teacher with
full use of his hands.

705
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,761
There's that new wrinkle.

706
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,045
I'll find a way to help you.

707
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,801
We'll heal your
hands and your eyes.

708
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,406
It wouldn't help us. It
wouldn't help them, would it?

709
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,002
This is your problem,
that you should solve!

710
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,565
Quentin, Penny,
they're not built for this.

711
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,563
I know, and I've tried.

712
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,846
Go back there.

713
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,729
You say that like
I could hop a bus.

714
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,802
Find a way back.

715
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,486
Find The Beast. Kill him.

716
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,524
If I could manage that,
we'd be sharing a drink right now,

717
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,807
not a care in the world
and four good eyes between us.

718
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,968
I'm sorry.

719
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,042
Just tell me what else I can do.

720
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,767
All we can do is
make them Magicians.

721
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,365
That's not enough.

722
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,930
I know.

723
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,125
Gonna just keep this
BBQ poppin', my love.

724
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,601
Quentin!

725
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,006
- Get over here.
- Quentin.

726
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,128
- Come on!
- Come on!

727
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,124
Join the party, sad sack.
Hurry up.

728
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:35,761
Oh, my God, it's not
like we have all day.

729
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,127
- We're so drunk.
- Okay, we have all day.

# Consequences of Advanced Spellcasting

1
00:00:00,137 --> 00:00:01,359
<i>Previously on The Magicians</i>...

2
00:00:01,479 --> 00:00:02,511
Have you ever
heard of Brakebills?

3
00:00:02,596 --> 00:00:04,385
<i>- No.</i>
<i>- It's, like, this secret Yale,</i>

4
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:06,501
and you have to be able
to do magic to even get in.

5
00:00:06,512 --> 00:00:09,341
<i>- Well, I can do magic.</i>
<i>- Yeah, so can I.</i>

6
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:10,619
<i>Sorry, I just got</i>
<i>your e-mail.</i>

7
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,989
<i>My fifth e-mail.</i>

8
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:13,405
<i>Just tell me</i>
<i>what you meant by--</i>

9
00:00:13,491 --> 00:00:15,821
I mean not herself.
I mean barely talks to me.

10
00:00:15,906 --> 00:00:18,202
<i>She looks like a goddamn ghost.</i>
<i>She's not Julia.</i>

11
00:00:18,288 --> 00:00:19,818
I need you to tell them
they were wrong about me.

12
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,018
Tell them to test me again.

13
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:22,484
I'm sorry, but they would know.

14
00:00:22,569 --> 00:00:23,866
It's really okay
if this is not your thing.

15
00:00:23,951 --> 00:00:25,865
- So you are--
- Top bitch in New York.

16
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,363
I'm willing to teach the right
people everything I know.

17
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:29,896
- Who are we trying to contact?
- Charlie.

18
00:00:29,981 --> 00:00:32,394
- And who's Charlie?
- My brother. He died.

19
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,643
Jesus, we could not have
screwed up that spell worse,

20
00:00:34,695 --> 00:00:35,734
and we can't take it back.

21
00:00:59,297 --> 00:01:00,628
<i>Now that you're in,</i>

22
00:01:00,713 --> 00:01:03,958
it's time to learn some magic.

23
00:01:04,044 --> 00:01:05,291
Just don't get too excited.

24
00:01:05,343 --> 00:01:07,457
Start slow.

25
00:01:07,542 --> 00:01:10,371
Yeah, I don't really do slow.

26
00:01:10,457 --> 00:01:11,788
Hmm...

27
00:01:20,618 --> 00:01:22,947
<i>Being a magician</i>
<i>has always been,</i>

28
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,697
<i>in part,</i>

29
00:01:24,783 --> 00:01:28,943
<i>about accruing power.</i>

30
00:01:29,029 --> 00:01:31,442
Power over yourself,

31
00:01:31,527 --> 00:01:33,108
the elements.

32
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:35,191
- Power over the future.
- He's back.

33
00:01:35,275 --> 00:01:38,355
The very world
that exists around you...

34
00:01:38,441 --> 00:01:39,821
He said he had an announcement.

35
00:01:39,906 --> 00:01:43,102
But power, as you all know,

36
00:01:43,154 --> 00:01:44,769
does not come cheaply.

37
00:01:46,436 --> 00:01:50,148
<i>There are reasons</i>
<i>we teach this curriculum</i>

38
00:01:50,234 --> 00:01:52,929
<i>precisely the way that we do.</i>

39
00:01:52,981 --> 00:01:54,511
<i>Skipping around,</i>

40
00:01:54,597 --> 00:01:56,261
<i>focusing on</i>
<i>all the wrong things,</i>

41
00:01:56,346 --> 00:01:57,843
<i>lack of guidance...</i>

42
00:01:57,928 --> 00:02:00,675
<i>these are all</i>
<i>extremely dangerous.</i>

43
00:02:00,761 --> 00:02:04,473
<i>There are certain energies,</i>
<i>certain spells,</i>

44
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:09,253
<i>which are far too powerful</i>
<i>for one magician alone.</i>

45
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:13,301
If you lose control,
they will turn against you.

46
00:02:13,387 --> 00:02:16,965
They will kill you.
They will consume you.

47
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,914
Change you...

48
00:02:18,966 --> 00:02:20,913
into something else.

49
00:02:39,903 --> 00:02:43,566
Now that I have your attention.

50
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:46,148
We test
to discern your discipline.

51
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:48,446
Your area of concentration.

52
00:02:48,531 --> 00:02:49,730
It is what you are,

53
00:02:49,815 --> 00:02:51,395
and with the right guidance,

54
00:02:51,447 --> 00:02:53,061
you may safely rise

55
00:02:53,146 --> 00:02:55,942
to unknowable heights.

56
00:02:56,028 --> 00:02:57,641
You will find
your scheduled times

57
00:02:57,727 --> 00:02:59,723
and invitations
inside your bags.

58
00:03:08,636 --> 00:03:10,050
Hey, babe, it's me.

59
00:03:10,136 --> 00:03:11,799
Um, ahem, just got your message.

60
00:03:11,884 --> 00:03:15,714
I'm so sorry, I got stuck.
Be there as soon as I can.

61
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:17,130
Love you.

62
00:03:23,794 --> 00:03:26,457
Never gets old, does it?

63
00:03:26,543 --> 00:03:28,089
Having a secret.

64
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:30,588
You have magic.

65
00:03:30,673 --> 00:03:33,536
They don't.

66
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,285
Better than money.

67
00:03:35,371 --> 00:03:38,200
Better than sex.

68
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:39,949
Well, I guess that one depends.

69
00:03:40,034 --> 00:03:42,414
James is cool, really.
He barely notices.

70
00:03:42,499 --> 00:03:46,362
We've both been
so busy with school.

71
00:03:46,414 --> 00:03:48,777
Look...

72
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:51,075
we all juggle.

73
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:53,607
You're kicking ass.

74
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:56,605
Just don't forget
to manage your shit.

75
00:03:56,691 --> 00:03:58,129
Don't want boyfriend
getting worried,

76
00:03:58,157 --> 00:03:59,688
following you
to the safe house door.

77
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:02,852
Got it covered, okay.

78
00:04:02,904 --> 00:04:04,600
I know you do.

79
00:04:04,686 --> 00:04:07,016
Just saying.

80
00:04:07,102 --> 00:04:09,565
Yes, these are promising.

81
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,731
I get a strong sense of blues

82
00:04:11,815 --> 00:04:15,011
and...and pinks.

83
00:04:15,063 --> 00:04:16,760
Is that Alice Quinn?

84
00:04:16,845 --> 00:04:19,925
Alice, please sit,
if there's a seat.

85
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,557
Bit of a transition.

86
00:04:21,642 --> 00:04:23,757
I find that I prefer an office
that I can reach

87
00:04:23,841 --> 00:04:25,588
without falling down
three flights of steps

88
00:04:25,674 --> 00:04:26,838
that I cannot see.

89
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,720
This'll be quick, Alice.

90
00:04:28,805 --> 00:04:30,885
Show Professor March
what you can do.

91
00:04:35,585 --> 00:04:37,332
Like I said, I used to do
a lot of coin and card tricks,

92
00:04:37,384 --> 00:04:38,714
and I guess sometimes

93
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:40,163
I, like, actually used
real magic.

94
00:04:40,248 --> 00:04:42,495
Predictions could mean psychic.

95
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,210
Vanishing could mean illusions
or physical magic.

96
00:04:45,296 --> 00:04:47,158
Curious.

97
00:04:47,243 --> 00:04:48,375
What? What's curious?

98
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,540
Now, try holding these.

99
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:54,404
Think the alphabet in Greek.

100
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,704
No.

101
00:04:55,789 --> 00:04:58,902
Just lovely, Miss Quinn.

102
00:04:58,987 --> 00:05:01,151
So clean.
Very advanced.

103
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:02,533
- Physical magic.
- Hm.

104
00:05:02,618 --> 00:05:04,148
Definitely.

105
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,389
Just stare at it.

106
00:05:20,974 --> 00:05:23,055
Well, you're not an herbalist.

107
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,686
Undetermined?
Can they do that?

108
00:05:25,771 --> 00:05:27,718
Yeah, Sunderland said
it happens,

109
00:05:27,803 --> 00:05:31,133
so I guess they'll
try again next year.

Phosphoromancy.

I bend light.

00:08:30,945 --> 00:08:33,574
That spell we did
to reach my brother.

160
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:37,105
I mean, I went over it,
like, a million times.

161
00:08:37,191 --> 00:08:40,020
Should have?
You saying that like you...

162
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:42,019
wanna do it again.

163
00:08:42,071 --> 00:08:44,184
Wait, you don't wanna
try it again, do you?

164
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:47,182
I need to know the truth,
that's all.

165
00:08:47,267 --> 00:08:50,847
You know, the spell
we did was, like...

166
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:52,845
I don't know,
it was like a phone call.

167
00:08:52,931 --> 00:08:55,893
We made contact,
but he didn't pick up,

168
00:08:55,979 --> 00:08:58,092
so then The Beast picked up.

169
00:08:58,178 --> 00:08:59,342
But that still leaves
the question,

170
00:08:59,427 --> 00:09:01,391
"Where's Charlie?"

171
00:09:01,476 --> 00:09:04,721
Well, the last time we asked
that question, somebody died.

172
00:09:04,807 --> 00:09:06,004
Never mind.

173
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:07,837
What do you care?

174
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:10,552
No.

175
00:09:10,637 --> 00:09:12,551
I do. I care.
I wanna help.

176
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:15,665
I just--I don't--

177
00:09:19,715 --> 00:09:20,912
Ooh, oh. Yeah.

178
00:09:20,997 --> 00:09:22,378
Um...

179
00:09:22,463 --> 00:09:25,875
have you read Teukolsky yet?

180
00:09:25,961 --> 00:09:27,742
Uh, so apparently

181
00:09:27,827 --> 00:09:30,040
you can find deceased spirits

182
00:09:30,126 --> 00:09:31,822
with a simple locator spell.

183
00:09:31,874 --> 00:09:33,489
If they wanna be found.

184
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:36,236
That's stupid.

185
00:09:36,322 --> 00:09:39,284
You're stupid.
You have a stupid face.

186
00:09:41,152 --> 00:09:44,365
Uh, anyone have a match?

187
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,646
Uh, it's not working.

188
00:09:46,698 --> 00:09:48,645
Just keep walking.

189
00:09:51,645 --> 00:09:55,308
Okay.
Finally.

190
00:09:56,975 --> 00:09:58,856
Guess it's Woof Fountain.

191
00:09:58,942 --> 00:10:01,971
Ugh. I never liked
this thing.

192
00:10:02,023 --> 00:10:04,686
Eliot says
it's enchanted as shit.

193
00:10:06,104 --> 00:10:09,016
Supposedly it's bottomless,

194
00:10:09,102 --> 00:10:10,383
so you know
the psychics love it.

195
00:10:10,469 --> 00:10:11,965
Suicide fountain.

196
00:10:12,017 --> 00:10:14,846
You don't think
your brother--

197
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:16,596
No.

198
00:10:16,631 --> 00:10:17,928
He wasn't that kinda guy.

199
00:10:17,963 --> 00:10:20,127
He was the kinda guy
who always wanted

200
00:10:20,129 --> 00:10:23,624
to fix things
for everyone around him.

201
00:10:23,626 --> 00:10:26,589
He was really, really good.

202
00:10:26,674 --> 00:10:28,421
You know that spell I did
on the first day of class?

203
00:10:28,507 --> 00:10:30,455
The Glass Horse?

204
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,953
He taught me that.

205
00:10:46,163 --> 00:10:49,076
Come on, let's go.
Nothing's happening.

206
00:11:10,123 --> 00:11:11,827
The whole thing is fucking pointless.

207
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:13,397
Psychic?

208
00:11:13,483 --> 00:11:15,229
I wanna punch Sunderland
in the throat.

209
00:11:15,315 --> 00:11:16,895
You know, as a psychic,
you'd think

210
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,594
- you'd have seen all this coming.
- Oh, woman, please.

211
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,260
Ah!

212
00:11:22,143 --> 00:11:23,757
Hold on.

213
00:11:27,091 --> 00:11:28,387
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa whoa.

214
00:11:28,473 --> 00:11:29,752
Are we actually
doing this again?

215
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:31,114
Do you know how
to close your mind?

216
00:11:31,171 --> 00:11:32,919
'Cause I will show you
right now.

217
00:11:33,004 --> 00:11:34,551
I thought I was.
Eliot gave me a--

218
00:11:34,636 --> 00:11:36,051
Seriously, man?

219
00:11:36,136 --> 00:11:37,916
Taylor Swift?

220
00:11:38,051 --> 00:11:39,964
I am not singing Taylor Swift

221
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,831
in my head.

222
00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:48,742
Okay, I'll work on it.

223
00:11:48,828 --> 00:11:50,574
Jeez.

224
00:11:56,572 --> 00:12:00,036
So, it's got lots of space.
Lots of light.

225
00:12:00,121 --> 00:12:03,567
It looks really great.

226
00:12:03,702 --> 00:12:05,615
I'm sorry, I guess
I thought you were still

227
00:12:05,734 --> 00:12:08,231
considering Yale
for the fall with me.

228
00:12:08,316 --> 00:12:09,563
What?

229
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:12,611
Okay, can we just
talk about this now?

230
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,061
Where is your head?

231
00:12:14,195 --> 00:12:16,558
Why do I feel like
I'm talking to myself?

232
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,190
I'm--I've just been busy
with class--

233
00:12:19,276 --> 00:12:20,475
Are you seeing someone else?

234
00:12:20,526 --> 00:12:22,389
No! Why would you
ask that?

235
00:12:22,474 --> 00:12:24,105
Because you're different.

236
00:12:24,224 --> 00:12:26,553
You stand me up.
You don't answer your phone.

237
00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:29,052
I'm just--I'm starting
to feel like the asshole.

238
00:12:29,187 --> 00:12:31,550
You're not.

239
00:12:33,135 --> 00:12:35,848
Hey...

240
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:37,880
I love you.

241
00:12:38,016 --> 00:12:40,878
You know that.

242
00:12:40,963 --> 00:12:42,877
Look, I know
I've been moody lately,

243
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,043
but...

244
00:12:44,178 --> 00:12:47,091
I feel a lot better.

245
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:49,873
James, come on.

246
00:12:52,374 --> 00:12:54,254
Hey.

247
00:12:56,004 --> 00:12:57,534
Mm.

248
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:00,083
Okay, go on.

249
00:13:00,202 --> 00:13:01,499
Someone killed themselves
in the fountain?

250
00:13:01,584 --> 00:13:03,531
Try 15 students and one dean.

251
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:06,863
Van Pelt.
Fountain's named after him.

252
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:10,743
It does feel a little bit off
here though, doesn't it?

253
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:16,856
Brief announcement.

254
00:13:16,992 --> 00:13:20,854
The Van Pelt fountain is
temporarily off limits.

255
00:13:20,939 --> 00:13:22,354
There's been an incursion.

256
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:29,016
We believe it's
a garden variety haunting.

257
00:13:29,151 --> 00:13:32,514
Redrawing the wards
may have released it

258
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,013
much like a mouse caught
in the walls of a building.

259
00:13:35,098 --> 00:13:36,345
Help!

260
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,843
No one was seriously hurt.

261
00:13:38,928 --> 00:13:40,976
Both students involved
are recuperating

262
00:13:41,061 --> 00:13:43,175
in the infirmary.

263
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:44,889
Regardless,

264
00:13:45,008 --> 00:13:48,755
stay away until we lock it down.

265
00:13:50,005 --> 00:13:51,836
Ow. I mean,
what if it was Charlie?

266
00:13:51,921 --> 00:13:54,051
I don't know.
Maybe.

267
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:57,666
If not, it's
a pretty big coincidence.

268
00:13:57,751 --> 00:13:58,998
But if it was Charlie,
don't you think

269
00:13:59,133 --> 00:14:00,331
that he would have
reached out to you

270
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:01,712
directly...

271
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,543
Maybe he just did.

272
00:14:13,107 --> 00:14:14,547
It's definitely Charlie.

273
00:14:16,005 --> 00:14:17,386
Okay.

274
00:14:20,469 --> 00:14:22,582
So, why would he try
and drown a bunch of psychics.

275
00:14:22,717 --> 00:14:25,414
Uh, have you met them?

276
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:28,379
Are you two talking about
what happened at Woof?

277
00:14:28,464 --> 00:14:31,294
I--that was
a private conversation.

278
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,242
= You know.
Well, meow.

279
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,455
What was that?

280
00:14:39,574 --> 00:14:41,903
I just--I don't trust her.

281
00:14:41,989 --> 00:14:44,902
Okay, look.
I just--

282
00:14:44,988 --> 00:14:47,567
I think trying to drown people
seems a little violent.

283
00:14:47,702 --> 00:14:49,460
He may not have even
known what he was doing.

284
00:14:49,535 --> 00:14:51,698
I mean, spirits,
they can get confused.

285
00:14:51,784 --> 00:14:53,102
Okay, then how do we talk to him

286
00:14:53,149 --> 00:14:56,229
without him trying to drown us?

287
00:14:56,314 --> 00:14:59,227
I don't know.

288
00:14:59,363 --> 00:15:01,225
But first thing's first.
I found a spell--

289
00:15:01,361 --> 00:15:03,225
well, five actually, but they
all have their own down side.

290
00:15:03,311 --> 00:15:05,028
Like, we don't know
how Charlie died exactly

291
00:15:05,108 --> 00:15:06,357
and the moon is
in the wrong spot right now.

292
00:15:06,442 --> 00:15:08,022
Look, I know
you don't trust her,

293
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,887
- but maybe Margo could--
- Or there's a Maori spell.

294
00:15:10,022 --> 00:15:12,385
I'd have to cut off a finger,
but they might be preferable.

295
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,268
To talking to Margo?

296
00:15:14,387 --> 00:15:18,098
Quentin, I need your help.
Highest priority.

297
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,182
- Let's go.
- Okay.

298
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:22,180
I--hey, look,
you said it yourself,

299
00:15:22,265 --> 00:15:23,424
you don't have all the facts,

300
00:15:23,515 --> 00:15:24,878
so maybe you don't need a spell.

301
00:15:25,014 --> 00:15:26,261
Maybe you need information,

302
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,258
and Margo's Discipline
is gossip, so...

303
00:15:40,255 --> 00:15:42,752
We have a real problem.

304
00:15:42,869 --> 00:15:44,083
Is it in the box?

305
00:15:45,668 --> 00:15:47,532
Professor Sunderland
came looking for a book

306
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,697
from the Physical
Cottage Library,

307
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,413
and it's missing.

308
00:15:51,532 --> 00:15:52,729
I diverted
her attention, but--

309
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,028
What does that have to do with the box?

310
00:15:54,163 --> 00:15:56,327
Books at Brakebills, Quentin,

311
00:15:56,412 --> 00:15:57,526
are not just books.

312
00:15:57,611 --> 00:15:58,858
One goes missing, it's not just

313
00:15:58,993 --> 00:16:00,657
a library fine
we're talking about here.

314
00:16:00,742 --> 00:16:03,072
- What're we talking about?
- We're talking about--

315
00:16:03,191 --> 00:16:05,521
we have...

316
00:16:05,656 --> 00:16:07,353
occasional parties.

317
00:16:07,438 --> 00:16:09,019
During one, someone took a book,

318
00:16:09,155 --> 00:16:10,735
and if we don't find that book

319
00:16:10,853 --> 00:16:12,849
the faculty are going to take
a harder look at our parties,

320
00:16:12,935 --> 00:16:14,599
and that cannot happen, Quentin.

321
00:16:17,349 --> 00:16:20,179
So you gonna tell me
what's in the box or...

322
00:16:24,594 --> 00:16:26,391
What the hell is that?

323
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,007
The missing book is Volume One.

324
00:16:28,143 --> 00:16:31,589
That...is Volume Two.

325
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:37,169
She's going to lead us
to her mate.

326
00:16:37,255 --> 00:16:39,001
Oh.

327
00:16:39,136 --> 00:16:41,749
<i>Odemknout.</i>

328
00:16:44,882 --> 00:16:46,829
<i>Odemknout.</i>

329
00:16:46,915 --> 00:16:48,296
Shit.

330
00:16:48,381 --> 00:16:50,161
Uh, let me--
let me try it again.

331
00:16:50,296 --> 00:16:53,126
Should be easy.
You're distracted.

332
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:55,041
I know I have a lot going on.

333
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:56,519
No, you don't.
You have this spell.

334
00:16:56,576 --> 00:16:58,156
That's it.

335
00:17:00,157 --> 00:17:03,319
So how do you manage it all?

336
00:17:03,404 --> 00:17:06,484
Juggling magic and your life?

337
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:10,782
I don't understand the question.

338
00:17:10,867 --> 00:17:12,481
I'm not judging you.

339
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:16,028
I started out like you
and you have a good life.

340
00:17:16,147 --> 00:17:17,944
Boyfriend.

341
00:17:18,029 --> 00:17:20,143
Probably think
he keeps you centered.

342
00:17:20,229 --> 00:17:22,192
- Right?
- Kinda.

343
00:17:22,311 --> 00:17:26,139
Or, you know, you're keeping
him around in case you fail here

344
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:28,970
and need to fall back.

345
00:17:29,056 --> 00:17:31,802
All I know...
you have to mean it

346
00:17:31,938 --> 00:17:33,269
for magic to work.

347
00:17:33,354 --> 00:17:36,933
Something clicks
when you're all-in,

348
00:17:37,018 --> 00:17:41,630
and the real big stuff,
you can't do it

349
00:17:41,715 --> 00:17:44,844
till you're doing it
without a net.

350
00:17:57,788 --> 00:18:00,452
I...

351
00:18:00,587 --> 00:18:01,918
I need your help.

352
00:18:02,003 --> 00:18:05,116
That wasn't so hard, was it?

353
00:18:07,117 --> 00:18:08,664
Look, I'm just trying

354
00:18:08,782 --> 00:18:10,613
to find out what happened
to my brother.

355
00:18:10,748 --> 00:18:13,111
He was a student here
five years ago.

356
00:18:13,247 --> 00:18:14,993
Okay.

357
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,273
He was a physical kid.

358
00:18:20,358 --> 00:18:22,821
His name was Charlie,

359
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,271
and he died.

360
00:18:24,356 --> 00:18:28,236
Know what?
I did hear about that.

361
00:18:28,321 --> 00:18:30,401
At Woof, right?

362
00:18:30,487 --> 00:18:33,766
Five, six years back?

363
00:18:33,851 --> 00:18:35,564
It's all making sense now.

364
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,730
- What is?
- You.

365
00:18:37,814 --> 00:18:39,562
The awkward thing.

366
00:18:39,648 --> 00:18:42,759
The anger underneath
the ineffable air of tragedy

367
00:18:42,895 --> 00:18:45,426
you wear like a perfume.

368
00:18:47,343 --> 00:18:50,306
Look, can you just tell me
what you know about Charlie?

369
00:18:50,425 --> 00:18:52,387
- Please?
- Loathe as I am to admit it,

370
00:18:52,473 --> 00:18:56,136
I don't actually know anything.

371
00:18:56,254 --> 00:18:58,218
Although, there was a girl

372
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,749
from Charlie's year who might.

373
00:19:00,835 --> 00:19:03,248
Emily Greenstreet.

374
00:19:03,383 --> 00:19:04,747
Who was she?

375
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,213
Just a girl.

376
00:19:06,298 --> 00:19:08,878
When he died,
apparently she took it hard.

377
00:19:08,963 --> 00:19:10,793
Dropped out.
Gave up magic.

378
00:19:10,912 --> 00:19:12,375
The Full Muggle.

379
00:19:12,461 --> 00:19:14,241
It was a bit of a scandal.

380
00:19:14,326 --> 00:19:15,624
Where is she now?

381
00:19:15,742 --> 00:19:16,873
The city.

382
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,406
Fogg set her up with a job

383
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:21,737
which is how you know
they're hiding something big.

384
00:19:21,873 --> 00:19:23,952
I know how to find her.

385
00:19:24,071 --> 00:19:25,401
Come on, I'll show you.

386
00:19:25,486 --> 00:19:27,867
I'd actually prefer to go alone.

387
00:19:27,952 --> 00:19:31,114
Oh, I know you would, but...

388
00:19:31,233 --> 00:19:33,230
what choice do you really have?

389
00:19:44,143 --> 00:19:46,522
Penny.

390
00:19:46,608 --> 00:19:49,887
Welcome.
Knew you were coming.

391
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,603
I know you've been
dreading this,

392
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,934
but you're gonna like it.

393
00:19:54,052 --> 00:19:57,183
The coves are for meditation

394
00:19:57,267 --> 00:19:59,880
while the enclosed
"Consciousness Areas"

395
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:03,429
are reserved as a place
to cry, and process.

396
00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:07,876
Hm.

397
00:20:07,962 --> 00:20:10,208
We call it "The Amplifier."

398
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:12,340
So basically, it's like turning

399
00:20:12,426 --> 00:20:14,422
your psychic powers up to 11.

400
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,038
Why would you wanna do that?

401
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:17,703
Oh, I get it.

402
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:20,169
You're one of those guys
who's trying to shut it out.

403
00:20:20,254 --> 00:20:22,367
You wanna get control of it

404
00:20:22,452 --> 00:20:25,865
or it will mess up your shit
big time,

405
00:20:26,001 --> 00:20:27,864
and this is the best place
to practice.

406
00:20:27,949 --> 00:20:30,413
So...

407
00:20:30,532 --> 00:20:31,662
I do what?

408
00:20:31,747 --> 00:20:32,861
Sit.

409
00:20:32,947 --> 00:20:34,161
Relax.

410
00:20:34,245 --> 00:20:35,859
Let your mind wander.

411
00:20:35,945 --> 00:20:37,192
It's pretty simple.

412
00:20:37,327 --> 00:20:39,574
But you gotta start
by letting go, tough guy.

413
00:20:39,692 --> 00:20:42,405
Less talking.

414
00:20:42,524 --> 00:20:43,688
No touching.

415
00:21:11,557 --> 00:21:13,221
<i>Help!</i>

416
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,719
<i>Please!</i>
<i>Help me!</i>

417
00:21:26,636 --> 00:21:28,266
Emily?

418
00:21:29,717 --> 00:21:31,048
No, don't run.

419
00:21:31,133 --> 00:21:32,714
These shoes are insane.

420
00:21:35,798 --> 00:21:38,410
You're from Brakebills,
aren't you?

421
00:21:38,862 --> 00:21:40,426
That part of my life
is behind me.

422
00:21:40,544 --> 00:21:43,257
- I'm sorry.
- Charlie was my brother.

423
00:21:49,664 --> 00:21:53,160
I just wanna know
what happened to him.

424
00:21:53,295 --> 00:21:56,625
Your brother saved my life.

425
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,823
Well, he tried to at least.

426
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,988
So, I fell for this professor.

427
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:05,319
I know how it sounds,

428
00:22:05,455 --> 00:22:08,317
but I was young and...

429
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:11,315
and he loved me.

430
00:22:11,401 --> 00:22:15,198
But then, well, he was married.

431
00:22:15,315 --> 00:22:17,312
You know how it is
when you're that age.

432
00:22:17,398 --> 00:22:20,694
You get...terrible ideas.

433
00:22:20,813 --> 00:22:23,276
Hmm.

434
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,524
Like what?

435
00:22:25,643 --> 00:22:29,305
I thought I could
make him love me again.

436
00:22:29,441 --> 00:22:31,470
Oh, some kind of love spell?

437
00:22:31,606 --> 00:22:34,635
No.

438
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:36,517
No.

439
00:22:36,636 --> 00:22:41,432
I thought if I could
make myself prettier.

440
00:22:41,516 --> 00:22:44,014
Oh...God.

441
00:22:44,133 --> 00:22:46,295
No one warned you
how dangerous that was?

442
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:49,260
I knew, but I'd convinced myself

443
00:22:49,345 --> 00:22:53,923
that it was the only way.

444
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:56,789
It took me weeks

445
00:22:56,874 --> 00:22:59,587
to figure out how to do it,

446
00:22:59,672 --> 00:23:02,285
and...

447
00:23:02,371 --> 00:23:04,751
<i>when I did, well, you--</i>

448
00:23:04,836 --> 00:23:06,450
<i>you can imagine how that went.</i>

449
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,944
No...

450
00:23:24,607 --> 00:23:28,104
I was gonna--I was
gonna kill myself.

451
00:23:28,189 --> 00:23:30,901
Emily!

452
00:23:30,987 --> 00:23:33,067
Wait!

453
00:23:33,153 --> 00:23:35,266
What happened?

454
00:23:35,402 --> 00:23:37,264
What did you do?

455
00:23:42,597 --> 00:23:44,760
Please.

456
00:23:44,845 --> 00:23:47,592
I just wanna help.

457
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,717
Don't tell anyone, please.

458
00:24:01,802 --> 00:24:03,049
Course not.

459
00:24:03,135 --> 00:24:04,631
Wait here.
I'll be back.

460
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,247
I'm gonna fix this.

461
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:12,460
He mashed a...

462
00:24:12,578 --> 00:24:13,910
bunch of stuff together.

463
00:24:13,995 --> 00:24:15,741
<i>It was--</i>

464
00:24:15,826 --> 00:24:17,291
<i>It was totally untested.</i>

465
00:24:19,325 --> 00:24:21,571
I really believed

466
00:24:21,707 --> 00:24:24,736
he might actually
be able to undo what I did.

467
00:24:24,871 --> 00:24:27,867
He was a good magician.

468
00:24:27,953 --> 00:24:30,067
You know, he--

469
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:34,115
he woulda done anything for me.

470
00:24:34,232 --> 00:24:36,229
<i>It was a lot.</i>
<i>It was--it was--</i>

471
00:24:36,315 --> 00:24:39,227
It was too much.

472
00:24:39,363 --> 00:24:43,275
I begged him to stop,
but he wouldn't,

473
00:24:43,394 --> 00:24:46,723
and that's when it went
totally out of control.

474
00:24:57,136 --> 00:24:59,432
It burned...

475
00:24:59,551 --> 00:25:02,681
right through him...

476
00:25:02,766 --> 00:25:07,177
until he wasn't there anymore.

477
00:25:07,262 --> 00:25:10,676
He was--
Do you know what a Niffin is?

478
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:14,874
- No.
- Yes.

479
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:16,838
It's when too much
runs through you.

480
00:25:16,924 --> 00:25:19,038
Consumes you.

481
00:25:19,172 --> 00:25:22,086
Only the magic is left,

482
00:25:22,204 --> 00:25:25,034
but you're not

483
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:26,250
you anymore.

484
00:25:26,367 --> 00:25:28,582
You're...

485
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:31,530
lost.

486
00:25:31,666 --> 00:25:34,029
Where did Charlie go?

487
00:25:34,114 --> 00:25:35,494
I don't know.

488
00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:39,492
He was just gone.

489
00:25:39,577 --> 00:25:41,857
I never saw him again.

490
00:25:41,992 --> 00:25:44,689
Um, who did all this then?

491
00:25:46,939 --> 00:25:49,070
My professor.

492
00:25:49,187 --> 00:25:52,350
Well, I guess you got
his attention after all.

493
00:25:52,436 --> 00:25:53,733
I quit school.

494
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:56,315
Gave up magic,
and never looked back.

495
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,928
I'm so sorry about Charlie.

496
00:26:05,395 --> 00:26:08,675
Hear that?
She's getting excited.

497
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:11,007
I think we're close.

498
00:26:11,092 --> 00:26:13,422
Hold this, will you?

499
00:26:17,388 --> 00:26:21,333
This bodega is warded
up the ass.

500
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,330
Hedge witches.

501
00:26:26,416 --> 00:26:28,995
Amateurs.
Magical D-leaguers.

502
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,328
Sad and desperate people.

503
00:26:31,463 --> 00:26:34,293
Once one of 'em offered
to blow me for a spell.

504
00:26:34,378 --> 00:26:36,791
It was fairly worth it.

505
00:26:36,877 --> 00:26:38,156
Let me do the talking.

506
00:27:02,478 --> 00:27:03,641
These are witches?

507
00:27:03,776 --> 00:27:06,023
Hm. Pathetic. No?

508
00:27:06,141 --> 00:27:09,971
Ugh, this kid's trying
Popper number four.

509
00:27:10,106 --> 00:27:12,220
It's painful.

510
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,715
Hear you're selling something.

511
00:27:21,132 --> 00:27:23,096
Quentin?

512
00:27:23,181 --> 00:27:25,295
Oh, hey.

513
00:27:30,646 --> 00:27:32,635
- What the hell are you doing here?
- What the hell are you doing here?

514
00:27:32,755 --> 00:27:34,385
You know these guys?

515
00:27:34,504 --> 00:27:35,782
Yeah, they're from Brakebills.

516
00:27:35,803 --> 00:27:36,885
- We're friends.
- That's right.

517
00:27:37,004 --> 00:27:38,125
We're from Brakebills.

518
00:27:38,245 --> 00:27:41,298
We're classically trained
and we want our book.

519
00:27:41,383 --> 00:27:44,130
We don't have your stupid book.

520
00:27:55,492 --> 00:27:57,321
Are they?

521
00:27:58,707 --> 00:28:00,120
Yep.

522
00:28:00,205 --> 00:28:01,403
Love wins.

523
00:28:15,564 --> 00:28:17,027
Hey!

524
00:28:17,145 --> 00:28:18,359
So, that's it?

525
00:28:18,478 --> 00:28:19,643
That's all you're
gonna say to me?

526
00:28:19,726 --> 00:28:21,307
Don't talk to her.
Keep going.

527
00:28:21,443 --> 00:28:23,440
I don't know what
you're doing here, Jules.

528
00:28:23,525 --> 00:28:25,273
You're better than this.

529
00:28:25,357 --> 00:28:27,021
You say that
like I had a choice.

530
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:28,470
- Of course you have a choice.
- No, because guess what?

531
00:28:28,605 --> 00:28:31,351
Magic wasn't just handed to me.

532
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:35,499
I told you to please
tell them about me.

533
00:28:35,602 --> 00:28:37,298
At first, you know,
I thought maybe

534
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:39,431
they'd actually test me again,

535
00:28:39,516 --> 00:28:41,096
and then I figured someone
would at least come

536
00:28:41,181 --> 00:28:44,127
and try to take my memory
again, and then...

537
00:28:44,213 --> 00:28:46,793
just waiting.

538
00:28:46,928 --> 00:28:48,291
It took me weeks to realize

539
00:28:48,377 --> 00:28:52,256
you never even
told them about me at all.

540
00:28:52,341 --> 00:28:55,005
- Look, Jules, I--
- You were my best friend.

541
00:28:55,122 --> 00:28:57,786
Yeah, and so I let it go.

542
00:28:57,871 --> 00:29:00,251
What does that mean,
"you let it go?"

543
00:29:00,336 --> 00:29:01,951
No, that's crazy,
I can actually do--

544
00:29:02,086 --> 00:29:04,499
The people at Brakebills,
Jules, they can bend light.

545
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:06,164
They can read minds.
They can fly.

546
00:29:06,282 --> 00:29:08,413
You can do a party trick.

547
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,493
So this is it, huh?

548
00:29:13,612 --> 00:29:15,325
The real you.

549
00:29:15,444 --> 00:29:18,107
Do you ever stop to think
about how maybe you treated me?

550
00:29:18,193 --> 00:29:19,773
What?

551
00:29:19,907 --> 00:29:21,322
I was always there--

552
00:29:21,441 --> 00:29:23,238
What? You were so nice
and you were so sweet

553
00:29:23,322 --> 00:29:26,269
to poor little Q who couldn't
get his shit together.

554
00:29:26,354 --> 00:29:28,100
- Don't put that on me.
- Between you and James it was

555
00:29:28,236 --> 00:29:29,767
- a two for one charity case.
- That's your interpretation.

556
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:31,599
- Why are you saying this?
- Because that is true, Julia!

557
00:29:31,684 --> 00:29:35,564
- No, that's not true. I--
- You know how I felt about you.

558
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:37,312
- I don't know what--
- Admit it. Just admit it.

559
00:29:37,431 --> 00:29:39,344
Admit it.

560
00:29:42,261 --> 00:29:44,091
So, you're gonna
punish me for that?

561
00:29:44,227 --> 00:29:46,090
I don't know what else to say.

562
00:29:46,226 --> 00:29:49,222
You can't blame me.

563
00:29:49,307 --> 00:29:51,720
Does James even
know that you're here?

564
00:29:51,806 --> 00:29:53,253
You're hanging out
with a bunch of tweakers

565
00:29:53,339 --> 00:29:54,657
who are turning tricks
for spells.

566
00:29:54,754 --> 00:29:56,084
Are you kidding me?
These people wanna--

567
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,417
Stop slumming
because you're pissed

568
00:29:57,553 --> 00:29:59,332
that you lost
for once in your life.

569
00:30:02,499 --> 00:30:05,045
I'm sorry, but I mean it.

570
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,578
You could really get hurt
doing this shit,

571
00:30:06,663 --> 00:30:09,709
and for what?

572
00:30:09,795 --> 00:30:13,124
Grow up.

573
00:30:13,243 --> 00:30:15,157
Do you love magic?

574
00:30:17,823 --> 00:30:19,820
Is it in your soul?

575
00:30:24,236 --> 00:30:27,233
Is it like the secret heart
of what you always were?

576
00:30:30,615 --> 00:30:33,445
Yeah.

577
00:30:33,564 --> 00:30:36,276
So you know how I feel.

578
00:31:09,043 --> 00:31:11,373
Get in.

579
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:21,999
Penny, how's your head?

580
00:31:22,084 --> 00:31:24,415
How you think?

581
00:31:26,949 --> 00:31:28,329
So, what's wrong with me?

582
00:31:28,414 --> 00:31:29,863
Nothing's wrong.

583
00:31:29,997 --> 00:31:32,161
I made the mistake of thinking
you were just psychic,

584
00:31:32,246 --> 00:31:35,359
but it...
it's more complicated.

585
00:31:35,495 --> 00:31:38,906
You are a Traveller.

586
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:41,571
A what now?

587
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,020
The rarest

588
00:31:43,106 --> 00:31:44,819
and most difficult Discipline.

589
00:31:44,905 --> 00:31:46,818
Travellers can,
with a little bit of training,

590
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:48,734
go anywhere on Earth instantly

591
00:31:48,853 --> 00:31:50,316
just as you did.

592
00:31:50,401 --> 00:31:54,347
But you can, with a great
deal of training,

593
00:31:54,483 --> 00:31:57,979
actually move between worlds.

594
00:31:58,063 --> 00:32:00,177
- Go to other worlds?
- Yes.

595
00:32:00,263 --> 00:32:03,559
If the gift
does not kill you first.

596
00:32:03,677 --> 00:32:06,840
Great. Just fucking great.

597
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:10,004
Do you know why I'm here?

598
00:32:10,139 --> 00:32:11,504
To say this.

599
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:13,635
You've been a thin layer
of insouciance

600
00:32:13,721 --> 00:32:17,050
over an open pit of self-pity
your entire life.

601
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:18,965
This is not a joke.

602
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:20,665
You do not have the luxury
to mess around

603
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,330
now that this is
out of the bottle.

604
00:32:22,466 --> 00:32:24,329
You will study this.
You will master this.

605
00:32:24,415 --> 00:32:25,829
Do you understand?

606
00:32:25,914 --> 00:32:28,660
Ain't you a bucket of empathy,
blind man.

607
00:32:28,795 --> 00:32:31,459
Please say yes.

608
00:32:31,544 --> 00:32:34,989
I cannot see you nod.

609
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:37,038
Fine.

610
00:32:38,074 --> 00:32:40,070
Yes.

611
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,867
So, are we just gonna drive
all the way back to Brakebills?

612
00:32:44,985 --> 00:32:47,865
We're already there.

613
00:32:58,062 --> 00:33:00,691
Penny.

614
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:02,940
I've learned a great deal

615
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:04,688
about Travelling over the years.

616
00:33:04,807 --> 00:33:06,604
We'll start one-on-one tutorials

617
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:08,520
to help you get
a handle on your ability.

618
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:09,968
Yes,

619
00:33:10,104 --> 00:33:12,800
before you accidentally
transport yourself

620
00:33:12,885 --> 00:33:16,298
inside a volcano.

621
00:33:26,294 --> 00:33:28,458
She's right.

622
00:33:28,593 --> 00:33:29,790
We were best friends.

623
00:33:31,842 --> 00:33:33,455
- Should we help?
- No.

624
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:35,837
<i>Let me in, you assholes!</i>

625
00:33:35,954 --> 00:33:39,785
I don't know what happened.
I don't know how it got so bad.

626
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:41,783
You found out who you are

627
00:33:41,918 --> 00:33:44,498
and she found out who she's not.

628
00:33:44,617 --> 00:33:45,747
Life.

629
00:33:49,114 --> 00:33:51,944
Tell you what.

630
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:55,109
Let's not talk.

631
00:33:57,909 --> 00:33:59,773
Shit!

632
00:34:02,357 --> 00:34:05,102
How long were you to douchebags
gonna leave me out there?

633
00:34:05,238 --> 00:34:08,234
Oh, never mind that.

634
00:34:08,319 --> 00:34:11,315
Now you're with your people.

635
00:34:11,434 --> 00:34:13,980
Cheers to that.

636
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:16,646
Good God.

637
00:34:18,263 --> 00:34:21,842
Cheers.

638
00:34:25,182 --> 00:34:26,941
So, this Niffin box?

639
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,909
- This have a lid?
- There isn't one.

640
00:34:31,044 --> 00:34:32,290
The Niffin becomes
fused with the wood.

641
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:33,957
It's unable to escape.

642
00:34:34,075 --> 00:34:36,122
- How do you activate it?
- There's a short chant.

643
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,738
You just basically repeat
"I bind you"

644
00:34:37,822 --> 00:34:39,121
in Turkish and English.

645
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,702
That sounds a little easy.

646
00:34:40,788 --> 00:34:42,536
Well, that and the
month long incantation it took

647
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,233
to enchant the thing
in the first place.

648
00:34:44,369 --> 00:34:47,899
So, this is
the enchantment research?

649
00:34:48,034 --> 00:34:50,531
We're not gonna use the box.

650
00:34:50,615 --> 00:34:52,862
What?

651
00:34:52,948 --> 00:34:54,529
We're gonna bring Charlie back.

652
00:34:54,613 --> 00:34:57,226
Okay, Alice this is the point

653
00:34:57,312 --> 00:35:00,192
where I look at you
like you're nuts.

654
00:35:00,276 --> 00:35:02,056
I--okay, look.

655
00:35:02,192 --> 00:35:03,555
I've been doing some research,

656
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:06,437
um, on Niffins.

657
00:35:06,556 --> 00:35:07,720
Look, they're not even alive.

658
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:10,185
Th--they're...
something else.

659
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,885
Look, I can't explain it,

660
00:35:12,019 --> 00:35:13,883
but I know that he's out there.
He's somewhere.

661
00:35:13,985 --> 00:35:15,099
Is there anything
in the literature that says

662
00:35:15,217 --> 00:35:16,598
that going Niffin is reversible?

663
00:35:16,717 --> 00:35:18,380
Nothing says that it isn't.

664
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,379
Exactly.

665
00:35:20,514 --> 00:35:22,378
So I found this spell
that can transmutate

666
00:35:22,464 --> 00:35:25,877
certain meta-quantum energies
into matter...in theory.

667
00:35:26,011 --> 00:35:27,708
And I combined it with an
advanced transformation ritual--

668
00:35:27,843 --> 00:35:29,173
Alice, this is Major Arcana--

669
00:35:29,258 --> 00:35:30,540
What? Just because
you couldn't do it?

670
00:35:30,675 --> 00:35:32,005
Nobody could do it.

671
00:35:32,091 --> 00:35:33,204
You're making it up
as you go along.

672
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:35,003
Look, I--

673
00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:37,202
- You are an amazing magician--
- Don't patronize me.

674
00:35:37,288 --> 00:35:38,585
I'm not patronizing you.
I'm telling you that

675
00:35:38,704 --> 00:35:40,833
- this is not a good idea.
- What do you know?

676
00:35:40,919 --> 00:35:42,533
Hmm?

677
00:35:42,668 --> 00:35:43,831
You only learned
about magic, what?

678
00:35:43,917 --> 00:35:45,698
- Three months ago?
- Okay, sure.

679
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:47,530
I--but even I can tell
that this is crazy.

680
00:35:47,614 --> 00:35:49,328
I don't understand
why you can't see that.

681
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:51,528
Fine. Stay behind.

682
00:35:51,662 --> 00:35:52,910
I'm here, and I'm only here,
to find out

683
00:35:53,028 --> 00:35:54,242
what happened to Charlie,

684
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:55,679
and now that I know
I can help him

685
00:35:55,743 --> 00:35:57,490
I'm going to.

686
00:36:15,265 --> 00:36:17,644
Thanks for coming so quick.

687
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:20,343
I was kinda surprised
you called.

688
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:22,509
Thought you disappeared again.

689
00:36:22,644 --> 00:36:24,474
You okay?

690
00:36:25,759 --> 00:36:28,339
You wanna talk about it?

691
00:36:28,425 --> 00:36:30,721
Please?

692
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,802
- Last call, Julia.
- I--

693
00:36:32,888 --> 00:36:36,217
I don't know
how to talk about it.

694
00:36:38,885 --> 00:36:42,081
I got involved with something.

695
00:36:43,498 --> 00:36:46,993
Made me wanna
give up everything.

696
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,126
Life, school...

697
00:36:49,211 --> 00:36:52,957
all of it.

698
00:36:53,043 --> 00:36:55,656
It got under my skin,

699
00:36:55,741 --> 00:36:57,704
and it--

700
00:36:57,823 --> 00:37:01,652
And?

701
00:37:01,737 --> 00:37:04,484
Jules, just tell me.

702
00:37:07,234 --> 00:37:10,197
It's Adderall.

703
00:37:10,315 --> 00:37:12,862
I started taking it

704
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,477
when I was applying
to grad school,

705
00:37:14,612 --> 00:37:17,942
and then I was taking
more and more.

706
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:21,690
I know I've been a bitch,

707
00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:24,971
but lately I've been
going to meetings.

708
00:37:26,806 --> 00:37:28,968
Wow.

709
00:37:35,133 --> 00:37:37,297
I--

710
00:37:37,383 --> 00:37:39,014
Can I--

711
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:41,345
I don't know, can I hug you?

712
00:37:41,464 --> 00:37:44,293
I wish you would.

713
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,674
It's okay, Jules.

714
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:51,288
I really love you, you know.

715
00:37:51,374 --> 00:37:53,587
I know.
I'm amazing.

716
00:38:21,823 --> 00:38:25,152
Okay, so, we're here, and...

717
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,818
Arrive at the place
of his transformation.

718
00:38:27,936 --> 00:38:31,815
Present yourself.

719
00:38:31,933 --> 00:38:33,763
There's a third step.

720
00:38:33,848 --> 00:38:36,927
What's the third step?

721
00:38:37,063 --> 00:38:40,925
I have to call in to him with
something personal between us,

722
00:38:41,011 --> 00:38:43,391
um...

723
00:38:43,476 --> 00:38:46,089
so Charlie used to sing to me
my favorite song

724
00:38:46,225 --> 00:38:47,756
when I was feeling bad

725
00:38:47,891 --> 00:38:49,671

Charlie, Charlie?

736
00:39:47,189 --> 00:39:49,518
- Charlie, is that you?
- Alice.

737
00:39:49,604 --> 00:39:53,382
Oh, my God, Charlie,
I can't believe it's you.

738
00:39:53,517 --> 00:39:58,547
I missed you so much.
I don't even know what to say.

739
00:39:58,682 --> 00:40:01,877
Charlie, what are you doing?

740
00:40:01,963 --> 00:40:02,876
Charlie, you're hurting me.

741
00:40:02,962 --> 00:40:04,842
Charlie, that hurts.

742
00:40:08,009 --> 00:40:09,873
You're just confused,
Charlie, it's me.

743
00:40:12,924 --> 00:40:15,869
Charlie--Charlie,
why are you doing this?

744
00:40:16,005 --> 00:40:17,702
Why?

745
00:40:17,837 --> 00:40:19,033
Alice, I don't think--
I don't think that we should--

746
00:40:19,169 --> 00:40:20,033
I know you're in there, Charlie.

747
00:40:20,169 --> 00:40:21,583
- I know it's you.
- Alice!

748
00:40:21,702 --> 00:40:24,365
Hah!

749
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:28,412
Charlie, stop!
I can help you.

750
00:40:37,608 --> 00:40:39,238
Alice, stop!

751
00:40:48,685 --> 00:40:50,398
Alice, he's gonna kill us.
It's not gonna work.

752
00:40:50,517 --> 00:40:52,148
- You have to stop.
- Shut up, I can do this.

753
00:40:52,233 --> 00:40:53,730
Alice, it's not Charlie.

754
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,561
Oh, shit.
Shit.

755
00:41:00,395 --> 00:41:04,473
<i>Emrediyorum!</i>

756
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:09,054
Alice, stop!
You're gonna kill yourself.

757
00:41:09,173 --> 00:41:10,836
You are bound and held fast.

758
00:41:10,972 --> 00:41:12,835
<i>Seni baglamak!</i>

759
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,051
No!
No!

760
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:16,883
I bind you!
<i>Seni baglamak.</i>

761
00:41:17,001 --> 00:41:18,049
- No!
- I bind you!

762
00:41:18,168 --> 00:41:20,381
<i>Seni baglamak.</i>

763
00:41:28,411 --> 00:41:32,707
You--you brought the box.

764
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:36,154
Yeah.

765
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:38,037
Alice, he was gonna kill you.

766
00:41:38,156 --> 00:41:41,701
Why did you think
you had to save me?

767
00:41:41,819 --> 00:41:44,449
Fuck you, Quentin.

768
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:46,982
You had no idea
what I was doing.

769
00:41:47,067 --> 00:41:50,646
I was so close,
and now he's gone.

770
00:42:14,517 --> 00:42:16,297
Where you going, kitty cat?

771
00:42:16,432 --> 00:42:18,629
I'm done here.
For good.

772
00:42:18,764 --> 00:42:20,428
You should be happy.
Less competition.

773
00:42:20,514 --> 00:42:22,927
Alice.

774
00:42:23,012 --> 00:42:24,958
I like competition.

00:00:03,863 --> 00:00:06,830
Quentin, I'd really
recommend further treatment.

4
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,771
Look, I've never threatened
to hurt myself or anybody else,

5
00:00:09,856 --> 00:00:11,009
so you can't make me stay.

Quentin!

9
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,564
I made the mistake of
thinking you were just psychic.

10
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:20,607
Do you know
how to close your mind?

11
00:00:20,727 --> 00:00:22,558
'Cause I will
show you right now!

12
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,267

19
00:00:44,886 --> 00:00:47,386
Top witch in New York,
for starters.

20
00:00:47,438 --> 00:00:50,577
Get me everything
on this list this week.

21
00:00:50,697 --> 00:00:52,208
<i>I don't know what</i>
<i>you're doing here, Jules.</i>

22
00:00:52,328 --> 00:00:53,781
<i>Magic wasn't just handed to me.</i>

23
00:00:53,901 --> 00:00:56,112
People at Brakebills, Jules,
they can read minds.

24
00:00:56,197 --> 00:00:58,564
They can fly.
You can do a party trick.

25
00:00:58,616 --> 00:01:00,032
You were my best friend.

26
00:01:00,067 --> 00:01:01,484
It's amazing I survived
as long as I did

27
00:01:01,569 --> 00:01:05,241
not knowing that
I was a magician.

28
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:07,039
I can't go back.

29
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:13,022
Fuck...

30
00:02:13,107 --> 00:02:14,940
Dude, you're in the wrong--

31
00:02:14,976 --> 00:02:18,027
or I'm in the wrong, uh...

32
00:02:40,835 --> 00:02:44,336
Hey! Big stuff.

33
00:02:44,422 --> 00:02:46,505
- Hey.
- Got 'em? I'm dying.

34
00:02:46,557 --> 00:02:48,340
Where are they?
Where are they?

35
00:02:48,426 --> 00:02:49,592
Oh, Jesus.

36
00:02:49,677 --> 00:02:51,060
- Where are they?
- Cut it out.

37
00:02:51,145 --> 00:02:53,646
You give me happy pills,
me love you long time.

38
00:02:53,681 --> 00:02:58,517
Eliot, they're looking
for you in arts and crafts.

39
00:02:58,603 --> 00:03:00,853
Watercolors.

40
00:03:00,905 --> 00:03:03,405
Without me, they're just--

41
00:03:06,027 --> 00:03:07,943
Quentin, could I speak to you?

42
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:15,701
Quentin?

43
00:03:15,753 --> 00:03:17,033
<i>Okay, this is obviously a dream</i>

44
00:03:17,038 --> 00:03:19,455
where I realize I'm in a dream.

45
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,861
So you think your life
is a dream?

46
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:21,875
No, my life is my life,

47
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:23,542
but this is like a--

48
00:03:23,628 --> 00:03:24,843
This is the bad collage.

49
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,795
You, the hospital,
the dean's office,

50
00:03:26,881 --> 00:03:28,881
the Brakebills--
it's all jumbled together.

51
00:03:28,966 --> 00:03:30,883
So we're back to Brakebills?

52
00:03:30,935 --> 00:03:32,101
Hopefully soon.

53
00:03:32,186 --> 00:03:33,886
Where you think you're a student

54
00:03:33,938 --> 00:03:35,888
studying to be a magician?

55
00:03:35,973 --> 00:03:38,357
Okay, let's just skip the part

56
00:03:38,392 --> 00:03:40,643
where you don't believe me,
okay?

57
00:03:40,728 --> 00:03:43,896
Um, yeah,
it's a little chilly in here.

58
00:03:43,981 --> 00:03:46,732
How about a miniature sun?

59
00:03:46,784 --> 00:03:48,067
That'd be great.

60
00:04:03,467 --> 00:04:04,750
I hate these dreams.

61
00:04:04,835 --> 00:04:06,302
It's like your feet
are stuck to the floor

62
00:04:06,387 --> 00:04:07,553
or you're paralyzed.

63
00:04:07,588 --> 00:04:09,305
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

64
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,757
You released me, remember,
in the real hospital?

65
00:04:11,842 --> 00:04:13,559
I remember what I said.
What was it?

66
00:04:13,594 --> 00:04:15,728
Uh, "You can't keep me here.

67
00:04:15,763 --> 00:04:17,479
I haven't hurt myself
or anybody else."

68
00:04:17,565 --> 00:04:18,731
You know that isn't true.

69
00:04:18,766 --> 00:04:20,432
Well, none of this is true,

70
00:04:20,484 --> 00:04:23,902
but I said that to you
in real life before Brakebills.

71
00:04:23,938 --> 00:04:27,656
Send him in.

72
00:04:27,742 --> 00:04:29,992
Quentin, do you remember why

73
00:04:30,077 --> 00:04:32,077
the court ordered you
to be here?

74
00:04:32,113 --> 00:04:35,614
The court? I don't...

75
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,866
If this is a trial dream,
I am--

76
00:04:37,952 --> 00:04:40,119
God, these things take forever.

77
00:04:40,171 --> 00:04:41,954
Come in, Penny.

78
00:04:42,006 --> 00:04:44,707
Show me again what you found
in Quentin's trash.

79
00:04:44,792 --> 00:04:46,353
I don't want to get
nobody in trouble.

80
00:04:46,427 --> 00:04:48,344
No. Hey,
it's okay, Penny.

81
00:04:48,429 --> 00:04:49,928
No one's in trouble.

82
00:04:56,937 --> 00:04:58,971
Thank you, Penny.

83
00:05:03,277 --> 00:05:05,310
Quentin,

84
00:05:05,396 --> 00:05:07,029
this is what happens when you
don't take what we prescribe.

85
00:05:07,114 --> 00:05:09,815
You start to hallucinate again
that you're a magician,

86
00:05:09,867 --> 00:05:10,983
you have powers.

87
00:05:11,068 --> 00:05:13,035
It's all here--

88
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,705
uh, the house of cards, Alice,

89
00:05:16,791 --> 00:05:22,795
Eliot, Margo,
the Physical Kids, The Beast.

90
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,631
I know this can
all seem very real,

91
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,332
but it's not.

92
00:05:27,385 --> 00:05:30,502
Brakebills is the hallucination.

93
00:05:30,554 --> 00:05:33,338
This is the reality.

94
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:35,340
You're seeing this, right?

95
00:05:35,393 --> 00:05:37,342
You're very, very sick.

96
00:05:40,514 --> 00:05:41,847
Are you not seeing this?

97
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:44,983
Oh, Jesus.

98
00:05:47,772 --> 00:05:50,572
I see you, Quentin,
and I'm very, very worried.

99
00:05:50,658 --> 00:05:53,942
Oh, okay.
They're gone.

100
00:05:54,028 --> 00:05:55,694
The moths, they're--

101
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,996
- They're gone.
- There are no moths, Quentin.

102
00:05:58,032 --> 00:06:00,032
There never were.

103
00:06:01,869 --> 00:06:03,786
Ah!

104
00:06:05,873 --> 00:06:07,623
Oh, I can't breathe.

105
00:06:10,795 --> 00:06:13,545
Code red! Code red!
Main office!

106
00:06:14,171 --> 00:06:29,443

107
00:06:29,563 --> 00:06:31,613
Don't let them see.

108
00:06:34,151 --> 00:06:35,784
I heard they shot you up.

109
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,487
I'm kind of foggy.

110
00:06:38,572 --> 00:06:40,906
No, no, no.
Just focus on me, okay?

111
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:45,160
None of this is real.
Just us two.

112
00:06:45,246 --> 00:06:46,995
And this.

113
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:51,300
Where are we?

114
00:06:51,385 --> 00:06:53,669
I mean, what's going on?

115
00:06:53,754 --> 00:06:56,421
You don't remember?

116
00:06:56,474 --> 00:07:00,259
I--I was at school,
I think, and...

117
00:07:00,344 --> 00:07:02,144
And then I fell asleep
at a party,

118
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:06,148
and then I'm here

119
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:08,100
where none of that
ever happened, and--

120
00:07:08,185 --> 00:07:09,268
No, no, no, no, no, no.

121
00:07:09,353 --> 00:07:10,352
- Oh, man.
- No.

122
00:07:10,437 --> 00:07:13,105
You came to find me.

123
00:07:13,157 --> 00:07:14,773
I did?

124
00:07:14,859 --> 00:07:16,942
To save me.

125
00:07:16,994 --> 00:07:20,279
But first, we have
to break the illusion.

126
00:07:20,364 --> 00:07:21,864
The illusion?

127
00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:23,909
I crash-landed on this planet
9.3 light-years ago.

128
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:25,667
- Alice?
- Wait.

129
00:07:25,753 --> 00:07:28,036
You're a starship captain,
and you came to rescue me.

130
00:07:28,122 --> 00:07:29,955
I--uh, no.
Hang on.

131
00:07:30,007 --> 00:07:31,507
But none of this is real.
It's--

132
00:07:31,592 --> 00:07:35,794
We're trapped in a cage,
a menagerie.

133
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,462
Alice?

134
00:07:37,548 --> 00:07:38,828
And they show us these illusions

135
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:40,299
to make us fall
in love and mate.

136
00:07:41,969 --> 00:07:45,137
Alice, that's enough.

137
00:07:45,222 --> 00:07:47,222
Give them back.

138
00:07:47,308 --> 00:07:49,308
- What, Dr. Fogg?
- All of them, Alice.

139
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,809
We need them for Bridge.

140
00:07:54,815 --> 00:07:56,148
They collect us
from all over the galaxy

141
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:57,533
to feed off our emotions.

142
00:07:57,618 --> 00:07:58,984
No, that's not true.

143
00:07:59,036 --> 00:08:00,569
It's an episode
of "Lost in Space."

144
00:08:00,654 --> 00:08:01,653
"Star Trek."

145
00:08:01,705 --> 00:08:02,988
What?

146
00:08:03,073 --> 00:08:04,434
That's an episode
of "Star Trek."

147
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:08,243
It's an episode
of "Star Trek."

148
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:10,212
They finally got to you.

149
00:08:10,297 --> 00:08:13,832
You belong to them now.

150
00:08:13,884 --> 00:08:15,083
It's okay.

151
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:17,920
I'll still mate with you.

152
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,505
All right, that's enough.

153
00:08:20,558 --> 00:08:22,341
- Me three!
- That's enough.

154
00:08:22,426 --> 00:08:23,842
Me three.

155
00:08:27,348 --> 00:08:32,184
Quentin, how are you?

156
00:08:32,269 --> 00:08:36,120
Are you feeling any better?

157
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:38,574
I guess.

158
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:40,075
Good.

159
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:44,079
Are you up for seeing a visitor?

160
00:08:47,608 --> 00:08:50,118
Hey, Q.

161
00:08:52,793 --> 00:08:54,876
I mean, Yale's still
kind of a letdown--

162
00:08:54,961 --> 00:08:56,911
still, in the best way.

163
00:08:56,997 --> 00:08:58,913
I mean, you would've--

164
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:02,584
Well, you--I mean, you will
totally agree, you know,

165
00:09:02,669 --> 00:09:04,836
once, you know, it's you.

166
00:09:04,888 --> 00:09:06,337
When what?
When I'm out?

167
00:09:06,423 --> 00:09:08,173
It's just so much
easier than I--

168
00:09:08,258 --> 00:09:09,758
than we expected, is all.

169
00:09:09,843 --> 00:09:14,679
So you've been at Yale
these last few months,

170
00:09:14,731 --> 00:09:17,265
and I've been here?

171
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:19,100
You don't remember?

172
00:09:19,186 --> 00:09:22,103
This? No.

173
00:09:22,189 --> 00:09:24,239
Okay.

174
00:09:24,324 --> 00:09:27,358
James is sorry
he couldn't make it tonight,

175
00:09:27,444 --> 00:09:29,360
but he'll be by next week.

176
00:09:29,413 --> 00:09:33,531
You know, we had
to lock down a church.

177
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,116
Church?

178
00:09:35,202 --> 00:09:37,118
Mm-hmm.
For the wedding.

179
00:09:43,627 --> 00:09:46,544
Are you engaged?

180
00:09:49,382 --> 00:09:52,801
- It's okay.
- No, it's not okay.

181
00:09:52,886 --> 00:09:54,207
Seriously,
it doesn't even matter.

182
00:09:54,221 --> 00:09:56,721
It's not important.

183
00:09:56,807 --> 00:09:59,724
- It's a spell.
- A spell?

184
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:03,645
We're all trapped in it,
and I'm the only one who knows.

185
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:05,230
Okay, look.
I know that I just--

186
00:10:05,282 --> 00:10:07,148
I sounded like Alice
just then, but I'll--

187
00:10:07,234 --> 00:10:12,487
Hey, um, I swear I'm not crazy.

188
00:10:12,572 --> 00:10:14,155
I want to understand, okay?

189
00:10:14,241 --> 00:10:15,406
- I want to help you.
- No.

190
00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:17,909
- Just tell me.
- No. No.

191
00:10:17,994 --> 00:10:21,463
No. Okay, I can do this.

192
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,759
Oh, God, look.

193
00:10:34,845 --> 00:10:37,762
Jules.

194
00:10:37,814 --> 00:10:38,813
Jules, look.

195
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:40,431
Look.
Are you seeing this?

196
00:10:40,484 --> 00:10:43,268
Look!

197
00:10:43,353 --> 00:10:45,103
Are you guys--
are you not seeing this?

198
00:10:52,112 --> 00:10:54,946
Okay.

199
00:10:58,451 --> 00:11:00,451
- Don't...
- What?

200
00:11:00,504 --> 00:11:02,127
- Look at me like that.
- Q--

201
00:11:02,247 --> 00:11:04,289
Don't feel sorry for me.
Do not.

202
00:11:04,374 --> 00:11:07,625
I'm not me, and you're not you,
and this is not happening.

203
00:11:07,677 --> 00:11:09,260
Do you hear me?
This is not happening.

204
00:11:09,296 --> 00:11:10,628
I'm not--I'm not here.

205
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,297
I am the one that
got into Brakebills.

206
00:11:12,349 --> 00:11:14,349
- I'm in Brakebills!
- Hey, you!

207
00:11:14,434 --> 00:11:17,135
Keep your voice down.

208
00:11:17,187 --> 00:11:21,139
I'm sorry.
It's my fault, um...

209
00:11:21,224 --> 00:11:22,690
Sorry.

210
00:11:27,935 --> 00:11:31,634
Hey, I'm gonna go, okay?

211
00:11:31,754 --> 00:11:34,055
Um, I'll be back Friday.

212
00:11:36,156 --> 00:11:39,324
This can't be my life.

213
00:11:39,409 --> 00:11:41,409
Jules, it can't be.

214
00:11:48,168 --> 00:11:51,669
I wanted to see the fireworks.

215
00:11:51,755 --> 00:11:53,638
I really did.

216
00:11:56,226 --> 00:11:59,644
Wait.

217
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:02,513
How did you know
they were fireworks?

218
00:12:02,599 --> 00:12:03,598
What?

219
00:12:03,683 --> 00:12:04,849
If you couldn't see them,

220
00:12:04,901 --> 00:12:06,568
how did you know
they were fireworks?

221
00:12:06,653 --> 00:12:08,186
You told me.

222
00:12:08,238 --> 00:12:12,190
I never said the word
"fireworks," Julia.

223
00:12:14,494 --> 00:12:16,611
What's going on here?

224
00:12:21,418 --> 00:12:23,534
Okay, did nobody see that?

225
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:27,171
- See what?
- You laughing at me.

226
00:12:27,207 --> 00:12:30,541
Laughing at you?

227
00:12:30,627 --> 00:12:33,344
What kind of a friend
would do that?

228
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,680
Exactly.

229
00:12:38,852 --> 00:12:40,802
Good-bye, Quentin.

230
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,643
What?

231
00:12:55,306 --> 00:12:58,724
All of them one by one.

232
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:00,843
Begin.

233
00:13:10,955 --> 00:13:13,772
I believe you, Quentin.

234
00:13:13,824 --> 00:13:16,909
You are a magician...

235
00:13:19,864 --> 00:13:21,747
A very bad one.

236
00:13:24,785 --> 00:13:27,119
One thing that's real:

237
00:13:27,171 --> 00:13:30,372
you're always a raging dick.

238
00:13:42,103 --> 00:13:44,353
Ellsworth Downs.

239
00:13:46,357 --> 00:13:48,807
Ellsworth Downs.

240
00:13:48,859 --> 00:13:51,226
Ellsworth Downs.

241
00:13:51,228 --> 00:13:53,395
Ellsworth.

242
00:13:53,447 --> 00:13:55,731
Ellsworth Downs.

243
00:14:00,738 --> 00:14:02,071
You know.

244
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,242
You know where to look, Quentin.

245
00:14:07,294 --> 00:14:09,211
I can't show you.

246
00:14:09,246 --> 00:14:12,381
I can't touch you.

247
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:15,000
It's very strong, this spell.

248
00:14:15,052 --> 00:14:16,135
It is?

249
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,753
It is a spell?

250
00:14:17,755 --> 00:14:20,973
It's in the book,
but the book is you.

251
00:14:21,008 --> 00:14:22,758
This is all you.

252
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,760
Me?

253
00:14:26,931 --> 00:14:29,098
Uh, which book?

254
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,766
Jane?

255
00:14:30,818 --> 00:14:33,736
I can't remember what,
uh--

256
00:14:33,771 --> 00:14:37,072
Jane, they gave me pills,
and I can't--I can't remember.

257
00:14:37,108 --> 00:14:39,825
Jane.

258
00:14:43,748 --> 00:14:45,364
<i>Jane.</i>

259
00:14:55,126 --> 00:14:56,208
No, No!

260
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,626
No, stop!
Stop it!

261
00:14:57,678 --> 00:14:59,678
Stop! No!

262
00:14:59,714 --> 00:15:01,380
The answer's in these books.

263
00:15:01,432 --> 00:15:06,885
Jane said that these books are
my key to getting out of here.

264
00:15:06,937 --> 00:15:09,722
Jesus.

265
00:15:09,774 --> 00:15:12,357
Every time I talk,
I sound batshit.

266
00:15:21,318 --> 00:15:23,118
Could I get some tape anyplace?

267
00:15:23,154 --> 00:15:24,787
Tape isn't permitted.

268
00:15:24,822 --> 00:15:27,823
Tape isn't permitted.
Right, I know.

269
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,408
But why, again?

270
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:32,327
'Cause you can harm
yourself or others.

271
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:33,796
It's tape.

272
00:15:33,831 --> 00:15:35,664
That can strangle,
suffocate--

273
00:15:35,716 --> 00:15:38,667
Okay, what if you
watched me the whole time?

274
00:15:38,719 --> 00:15:40,919
No one has that kind of time.

275
00:15:40,971 --> 00:15:42,805
I need to put these pages
back together.

276
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,673
You need to get
to music therapy.

277
00:15:49,346 --> 00:15:53,315
Music is a way for us
to express and receive feeling

278
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,401
in a way that is safe and fun

279
00:15:56,437 --> 00:15:58,937
and sometimes illuminating.

280
00:15:58,989 --> 00:16:00,272
So who'd like to begin?

281
00:16:00,324 --> 00:16:02,741
Oh, God,
please not that one song.

282
00:16:02,777 --> 00:16:04,159
Ah, I'm sorry.

283
00:16:04,195 --> 00:16:07,029
What was that, Penny?

284
00:16:07,031 --> 00:16:10,999
Oh, that one song, please, no.

285
00:16:11,035 --> 00:16:13,418
It gets in my head,
and it never leaves.

286
00:16:13,454 --> 00:16:14,787
Oh, which song is that?

287
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:17,256
"Michael Rowed
the Boat Ashore."

288
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:20,175
#Agree.

289
00:16:20,211 --> 00:16:21,710
Everything here is me.

290
00:16:21,762 --> 00:16:23,128
All right, everyone,

291
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,930
why don't we kick it off
with the Beatles?

292
00:16:24,965 --> 00:16:27,883
"Helter Skelter."
Helter Skelter," please!

293
00:16:27,885 --> 00:16:29,802

Hey, Penny, good luck
getting that out of your head.

326
00:17:49,022 --> 00:17:51,848
<i>Doctor...</i>

327
00:17:54,963 --> 00:17:57,628
I hear you were the hit of
music therapy today, Quentin.

328
00:17:57,748 --> 00:17:59,589
Look, I think I know
what's going on here,

329
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,114
and I think I know
how to get help.

330
00:18:01,234 --> 00:18:02,994
Well, help is why we're here.

331
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:04,614
No, it's not.

332
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,199
I don't mean to be rude,
but you're here

333
00:18:06,201 --> 00:18:07,367
because of a spell, and I need
to break the spell.

334
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,701
Quentin--

335
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:10,703
And if I can just reach
Penny, the real Penny,

336
00:18:10,705 --> 00:18:13,039
and if--if I can get
inside of his head--

337
00:18:13,091 --> 00:18:14,290
Enough.

338
00:18:14,342 --> 00:18:16,176
That's enough.

339
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:24,434
Can I please have some tape?

340
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:27,804
Do you remember the last time
you saw your father?

341
00:18:29,391 --> 00:18:30,557
Dinner a few months ago.

342
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:31,724
Why?

343
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:40,867
Dad?

344
00:18:40,902 --> 00:18:44,237
Hello, Curly Q.

345
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:46,823
I...

346
00:18:56,418 --> 00:18:58,751
What happened to your face?

347
00:18:58,753 --> 00:19:01,254
Did you run into a door or...

348
00:19:04,092 --> 00:19:06,809
You did that, Quentin.

349
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,678
I--

350
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:13,066
Come on.

351
00:19:13,101 --> 00:19:15,101
It's time you see something.

352
00:19:20,575 --> 00:19:22,408
<i>Look, I'm telling you</i>
<i>it wasn't my dad.</i>

353
00:19:22,444 --> 00:19:24,077
<i>It was The Beast.</i>

354
00:19:24,112 --> 00:19:26,829
<i>I never even touched him!</i>
<i>I used battle magic,</i>

355
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,831
<i>the same magic that I'm gonna</i>
<i>use to get out of here.</i>

356
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:33,419
<i>Are you ready?</i>
<i>Come on. Come on!</i>

357
00:19:33,455 --> 00:19:35,371
<i>What did you do to my powers?</i>

358
00:19:35,423 --> 00:19:37,707
<i>I need my powers.</i>
<i>The Beast is here, okay?</i>

359
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,093
<i>He's coming for me.</i>
<i>He's coming for you.</i>

360
00:19:40,128 --> 00:19:41,511
<i>He is coming to kill us.</i>

361
00:19:41,546 --> 00:19:44,347
<i>You have got to give me</i>
<i>back my power!</i>

362
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,302
<i>I've got to save you!</i>

363
00:19:49,304 --> 00:19:50,720
<i>Ahh!</i>

364
00:19:55,393 --> 00:19:57,560
Do you remember that night?

365
00:19:57,612 --> 00:20:00,446
Um...

366
00:20:00,482 --> 00:20:02,649
Your father does.

367
00:20:02,651 --> 00:20:05,151
Tell him, Ted.

368
00:20:05,153 --> 00:20:06,569
He needs to hear it.

369
00:20:06,621 --> 00:20:10,657
He needs to know the truth
why he's here.

370
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:13,376
We were having dinner
to celebrate

371
00:20:13,411 --> 00:20:17,497
when you got into Yale, and...

372
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,165
in the middle of the restaurant,

373
00:20:19,217 --> 00:20:21,501
you suddenly said
there were moths everywhere.

374
00:20:21,503 --> 00:20:22,835
No.

375
00:20:22,887 --> 00:20:24,837
And then you started
calling me The Beast.

376
00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:26,756
Mm-mm.

377
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,675
You're lying.

378
00:20:28,677 --> 00:20:30,343
And then you picked up a knife.

379
00:20:30,345 --> 00:20:32,512
- Mm-mm. No.
- I tried to stop you.

380
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:35,848
I grabbed you.
I tried to stop you from...

381
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:38,184
What?
From--from what?

382
00:20:38,186 --> 00:20:40,653
You tried to kill
your father, Quentin.

383
00:20:50,505 --> 00:20:52,338
You need to stop fighting this
Quentin.

384
00:20:52,924 --> 00:20:56,944
The more you believe in magic,
Brakebills, The Beast,

385
00:20:57,064 --> 00:20:59,896
<i>the more harm you do.</i>

386
00:20:59,931 --> 00:21:04,267
<i>Accept who you are</i>
<i>and what's put you here.</i>

387
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:06,795
That's how you get better,
Quentin.

388
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:09,291
<i>I promise.</i>

389
00:21:09,326 --> 00:21:12,161
Hey, you, seriously, talk to me.

390
00:21:12,213 --> 00:21:16,331
Are you fucking with me?

391
00:21:18,135 --> 00:21:20,335
Dude.

392
00:21:20,421 --> 00:21:24,006
Uh, um, look, this'll
all be over soon, okay?

393
00:21:24,091 --> 00:21:26,508
Just try not
to get buried under it.

394
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,478

Do it again, harder.

Harder.

426
00:22:48,843 --> 00:22:50,309
Ow.

427
00:22:52,229 --> 00:22:53,896
Nobody here can see you.

428
00:22:53,931 --> 00:22:57,015
Yeah, 'cause there's
no here, dumbass.

429
00:22:57,101 --> 00:22:58,233
This is all in your head.

430
00:22:58,269 --> 00:23:00,269
I'm in your head.

431
00:23:00,354 --> 00:23:02,488
Now stop singing that song so I
can go the fuck back to sleep.

432
00:23:02,573 --> 00:23:03,939
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

433
00:23:04,024 --> 00:23:06,074
Oh, my God.
It worked.

434
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,276
I did that.
I called you.

435
00:23:07,328 --> 00:23:08,994
I called you with the song.

436
00:23:09,079 --> 00:23:11,029
- You called me?
- I'm in trouble.

437
00:23:11,115 --> 00:23:13,749
Seriously, help me.

438
00:23:13,784 --> 00:23:16,451
- What is today out there?
- Wednesday.

439
00:23:16,537 --> 00:23:19,371
So I've only been gone
for a night.

440
00:23:19,456 --> 00:23:21,039
Am I asleep there somewhere?

441
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:22,124
Man, I don't know
what you do at night,

442
00:23:22,209 --> 00:23:23,342
and I don't want to know.

443
00:23:23,427 --> 00:23:25,260
- Where are you?
- Trying to sleep.

444
00:23:25,296 --> 00:23:26,378
This is not a dream.

445
00:23:26,463 --> 00:23:27,880
It--it's a--

446
00:23:27,965 --> 00:23:30,265
All of this, it's a spell.

447
00:23:30,301 --> 00:23:34,853
Please, listen.
Find me, okay?

448
00:23:34,939 --> 00:23:36,138
Out there, find me.

449
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:39,141
I have to be conscious
to break the spell.

450
00:23:39,226 --> 00:23:40,692
Okay, you have to wake up.

451
00:23:40,778 --> 00:23:42,227
Wake up.

452
00:23:42,313 --> 00:23:43,695
Wake up. Wake up.

453
00:23:43,781 --> 00:23:44,897
Wake up. Wake up!
Wake up!

454
00:23:44,982 --> 00:23:47,449
You, you will not be shouting.

455
00:23:47,484 --> 00:23:48,984
End it now, buster.

456
00:23:49,036 --> 00:23:50,369
Wake the hell up!

457
00:23:58,746 --> 00:24:00,329
Okay.

458
00:24:00,414 --> 00:24:02,998
Good job.

459
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:06,051
Wow.

460
00:24:06,136 --> 00:24:10,339
My whole body, every part
of my body, is tingling.

461
00:24:10,391 --> 00:24:11,890
I mean, you didn't tell me
it would feel--

462
00:24:11,976 --> 00:24:14,092
So good?

463
00:24:14,178 --> 00:24:18,180
It's high-end, designer
cooperative magic.

464
00:24:18,232 --> 00:24:21,483
It does something to your cells
to channel all that juice.

465
00:24:21,518 --> 00:24:23,986
Everyone gets stronger.

466
00:24:24,021 --> 00:24:26,772
Um, I just, um...

467
00:24:26,857 --> 00:24:32,077
I didn't think Q
would, uh, fall in so deep.

468
00:24:32,162 --> 00:24:35,030
Oh, this is nothing.

469
00:24:35,115 --> 00:24:38,033
Uh, what--
what does that mean?

470
00:24:38,118 --> 00:24:39,998
Well, I mean he might want
to take his shoes off

471
00:24:40,004 --> 00:24:41,286
and get comfortable.

472
00:24:41,372 --> 00:24:42,871
We cooked up a whopper here.

473
00:24:42,957 --> 00:24:45,090
I don't really see him
getting out of it,

474
00:24:45,175 --> 00:24:46,959
even with your boyfriend's help.

475
00:24:50,047 --> 00:24:54,266
Mm, I thought the idea
was to just mess with him.

476
00:24:54,351 --> 00:24:58,186
My idea was to fuck him up hard,

477
00:24:58,222 --> 00:25:02,274
and you loved it even harder.

478
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:04,776
Yeah, yeah, fuck him up,
not kill him.

479
00:25:04,862 --> 00:25:06,194
Wait, what?
Kill him?

480
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,196
Oh, he's not gonna die.

481
00:25:08,232 --> 00:25:12,034
He just might not actually
ever wake up.

482
00:25:12,069 --> 00:25:13,952
Oh, my God.

483
00:25:14,038 --> 00:25:16,238
Hey, you are not going
limp on me here.

484
00:25:16,290 --> 00:25:19,741
This is game time, ladies.

485
00:25:19,827 --> 00:25:21,877
You got the ball, Kady.

486
00:25:21,912 --> 00:25:24,496
Don't drop it.

487
00:25:24,581 --> 00:25:28,083
Now go put all that
sweet hotness to work.

488
00:25:42,016 --> 00:25:44,316
Sorry.

489
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:20,282
Ellsworth Downs, Ellsworth...

490
00:26:21,072 --> 00:26:24,490
Downs, Ellis...

491
00:26:24,575 --> 00:26:26,292
Wirth-Downs,
Ellis Wirth-Downs.

492
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:27,576
The Madness Maker.

493
00:26:27,662 --> 00:26:29,495
Oh, God.

494
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,130
Okay.

495
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:32,604
"In all of Fillory,

496
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:36,835
"one magician could drive
every other magician insane.

497
00:26:37,257 --> 00:26:39,891

511

But soon, Jane figured out
how to break this curse."

512
00:27:18,348 --> 00:27:20,848
Thank you, Jane Chatwin.

513
00:27:20,934 --> 00:27:25,386
"The Madness Maker's
curse was"--

514
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:30,942
It's okay. It's okay.
I know this. I know this.

515
00:27:30,977 --> 00:27:34,362
I know this. I know this.
I know this.

516
00:27:34,447 --> 00:27:36,481
What did Jane say?

517
00:27:36,533 --> 00:27:38,616
God, why can't I remember?

518
00:27:43,239 --> 00:27:46,791
Okay, look, I am, like,
100% sure I invented you,

519
00:27:46,826 --> 00:27:50,578
so if you could please
just disappear?

520
00:27:52,582 --> 00:27:54,549
Look, it was a party.

521
00:27:54,634 --> 00:27:57,502
He's probably sleeping it off
under something

522
00:27:57,554 --> 00:27:59,137
or someone or--

523
00:27:59,172 --> 00:28:01,389
Hey.

524
00:28:01,474 --> 00:28:02,840
Where you been?

525
00:28:02,892 --> 00:28:04,676
I had to run into the city.

526
00:28:04,761 --> 00:28:06,310
What's up?

527
00:28:06,346 --> 00:28:08,896
Your lover man here
thinks our little Q

528
00:28:08,982 --> 00:28:10,431
got roofied last night.

529
00:28:10,517 --> 00:28:11,649
Look, we covered the house.

530
00:28:11,685 --> 00:28:13,234
Let's start checking the lab,

531
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:16,187
the libraries, or whatever.

532
00:28:16,272 --> 00:28:17,739
I know where he is.

533
00:28:22,862 --> 00:28:26,364
He crawled in here
and passed out around 1:00.

534
00:28:26,449 --> 00:28:29,367
Anyway, I've seen weirder.

535
00:28:29,419 --> 00:28:30,835
Come on.
Hey, wake up.

536
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:35,206
He's breathing.
That's something.

537
00:28:35,291 --> 00:28:37,258
Let me try.

538
00:28:41,881 --> 00:28:43,765
This is bad.

539
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:45,183
How bad?

540
00:28:45,218 --> 00:28:47,101
"We need to tell the dean" bad.

541
00:28:56,196 --> 00:28:57,445
Now what?

542
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:59,397
We wait.

543
00:29:02,485 --> 00:29:04,786
When are you gonna tell me
what all this is for?

544
00:29:04,871 --> 00:29:06,537
I did.

545
00:29:06,573 --> 00:29:08,706
Bigger, better magic.

546
00:29:08,742 --> 00:29:11,876
Yeah, you just
never mentioned how.

547
00:29:11,911 --> 00:29:14,128
I guess I could tell you now.

548
00:29:14,214 --> 00:29:15,413
No, I don't feel like it.

549
00:29:15,465 --> 00:29:17,215
Later maybe?

550
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:20,134
Mm, how about never?
That's a growing possibility.

551
00:29:22,722 --> 00:29:24,806
Hmm.

552
00:29:24,891 --> 00:29:27,308
Yes, I thought so.

553
00:29:27,393 --> 00:29:29,427
The spell is called
a Scarlatti Web.

554
00:29:29,512 --> 00:29:30,678
We cannot break it.

555
00:29:30,764 --> 00:29:32,180
No one can.

556
00:29:32,265 --> 00:29:34,932
Wait, he's not
gonna wake up ever?

557
00:29:34,984 --> 00:29:38,269
I said "no one,"
not "nothing."

558
00:29:38,321 --> 00:29:40,404
We need to summon a Matarese.

559
00:29:42,275 --> 00:29:45,943
Quentin, I really thought
we were making progress.

560
00:29:45,995 --> 00:29:47,862
I was wrong.

561
00:29:54,621 --> 00:29:55,620
No.
What are you--

562
00:29:55,622 --> 00:29:56,954
Lower the wards please.

563
00:30:05,298 --> 00:30:08,299
Very good. And now the South
wards.

564
00:30:11,738 --> 00:30:15,473
Dean Fogg following
the playbook.

565
00:30:15,542 --> 00:30:18,526
The only thing that can break
our spell on your ex-BFF

566
00:30:18,611 --> 00:30:22,814
is a Matarese--evil bug spirit
of the underworld.

567
00:30:22,899 --> 00:30:24,419
About the only way
one of those can get

568
00:30:24,484 --> 00:30:26,951
into this sugary wonderland

569
00:30:26,986 --> 00:30:29,620
<i>is to lower all the protective</i>
<i>wards and shields</i>

570
00:30:29,656 --> 00:30:33,241
in the school, letting any old
anyone waltz right in.

571
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:39,831
Welcome back to Brakebills.

572
00:30:39,883 --> 00:30:42,300
Let's go steal their shit.

573
00:30:54,397 --> 00:30:55,847
Careful.

574
00:31:00,486 --> 00:31:03,654
Good.

575
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:07,191
<i>Daemonium Matarese, ecce vocavi</i>

576
00:31:07,243 --> 00:31:09,660
<i>te in carcere liberare mens est.</i>

577
00:31:09,696 --> 00:31:12,413
<i>Imperio Scarlatti telem nobus.</i>

578
00:31:12,498 --> 00:31:15,583
That's the answer?

579
00:31:15,668 --> 00:31:17,335
It shorts out
the cerebral cortex,

580
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:19,587
which should break him
out of the spell,

581
00:31:19,672 --> 00:31:21,672
which should bring him back,
halfway.

582
00:31:21,708 --> 00:31:23,708
Halfway?

583
00:31:23,793 --> 00:31:26,711
The spell is like a prison
in the middle of the desert.

584
00:31:26,763 --> 00:31:28,679
The Matarese breaks you
out of the prison,

585
00:31:28,715 --> 00:31:31,883
but you have to get yourself
out of the desert,

586
00:31:31,968 --> 00:31:34,886
and it is a lot easier
with a guide.

587
00:31:34,971 --> 00:31:36,804
Penny, are you ready?

588
00:32:06,719 --> 00:32:08,636
Quentin?

589
00:32:11,507 --> 00:32:14,926
Quentin!
Answer me!

590
00:32:14,978 --> 00:32:18,396
The problem is
in your frontal lobe, Quentin.

591
00:32:18,431 --> 00:32:21,899
Your emotions are
in complete control now,

592
00:32:21,935 --> 00:32:26,320
overriding logic, reason,
even the will to live.

593
00:32:26,406 --> 00:32:27,772
So this...

594
00:32:29,993 --> 00:32:31,776
Is inserted into the eye socket.

595
00:32:31,828 --> 00:32:33,411
No, no, no, no, no.

596
00:32:33,446 --> 00:32:35,579
It's called
a transorbital lobotomy.

597
00:32:38,251 --> 00:32:39,867
Dad.

598
00:32:39,953 --> 00:32:42,870
Dad. Dad.

599
00:32:42,956 --> 00:32:44,672
No, no, no, no, no, no.

600
00:32:44,757 --> 00:32:46,624
No, no, don't!

601
00:32:46,709 --> 00:32:49,299
Dad, don't!

602
00:32:50,948 --> 00:32:52,047
Dad!

603
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:54,333
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

604
00:32:54,418 --> 00:32:56,747
No, please, don't.
I didn't mean to, I swear.

605
00:32:56,867 --> 00:32:58,754
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, stop!

606
00:32:58,806 --> 00:33:01,408
Stop talking.
Stop listening.

607
00:33:01,528 --> 00:33:04,445
There are only three things
that are real: you, me, and...

608
00:33:10,703 --> 00:33:12,987
That.

609
00:33:13,073 --> 00:33:14,655
Get up.
There are no straps.

610
00:33:14,707 --> 00:33:16,290
This is not a hospital.

611
00:33:16,326 --> 00:33:17,458
You are not crazy.

612
00:33:17,494 --> 00:33:19,077
You can make it disappear.

613
00:33:19,162 --> 00:33:20,495
Do it!

614
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,977
Quentin?

615
00:33:38,148 --> 00:33:41,182
The old alma mater
hasn't changed a lick.

616
00:33:41,234 --> 00:33:42,567
Wait, you went here?

617
00:33:42,652 --> 00:33:45,436
Kicked out three months
before graduation.

618
00:33:45,522 --> 00:33:48,573
So, what, this is revenge?

619
00:33:48,658 --> 00:33:50,024
When you're here for that long,

620
00:33:50,076 --> 00:33:51,609
they can't just erase you.

621
00:33:51,694 --> 00:33:53,277
They take you
into a special room

622
00:33:53,363 --> 00:33:54,695
off the dean's office

623
00:33:54,747 --> 00:33:57,665
and remove every memory
you make here.

624
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:04,005
Every single magical thing
you learned amputated,

625
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,040
but those memories are stored.

626
00:34:12,048 --> 00:34:13,598
Normally there's a shield
on this door

627
00:34:13,683 --> 00:34:15,716
a hundred magicians
couldn't break.

628
00:34:15,768 --> 00:34:18,102
Now...

629
00:34:19,556 --> 00:34:22,557
Keep a lookout.

630
00:34:22,609 --> 00:34:25,893
Wait, what's going--

631
00:34:31,384 --> 00:34:33,186
It isn't working.
What happened?

632
00:34:33,306 --> 00:34:35,094
I don't know.
I went there.

633
00:34:35,214 --> 00:34:37,381
I told him,
the Matarese did his thing,

634
00:34:37,501 --> 00:34:40,992
and then everything went black.

635
00:34:53,314 --> 00:34:54,814
Hey.

636
00:34:54,866 --> 00:34:56,399
He's not gonna wake up...

637
00:34:56,484 --> 00:34:57,400
ever.

638
00:34:57,485 --> 00:34:58,617
No, Marina
just has to--

639
00:34:58,653 --> 00:35:02,154
Marina is a psycho.

640
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,324
You were his friend.

641
00:35:05,376 --> 00:35:06,826
It's her spell.
I can't--

642
00:35:06,878 --> 00:35:09,495
No, I didn't sign up for this shit.

643
00:35:09,547 --> 00:35:13,833
No, you have to go
reverse it now.

644
00:36:01,048 --> 00:36:03,716
Well, I can finally
reach you again,

645
00:36:03,801 --> 00:36:06,469
but that's never been
the problem, has it--

646
00:36:06,554 --> 00:36:07,849
my reaching you?

647
00:36:07,969 --> 00:36:10,639
Will you please,
just for once--

648
00:36:10,725 --> 00:36:12,775
no more riddles, okay?

649
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,727
Just tell me what to do.

650
00:36:14,779 --> 00:36:17,279
It doesn't matter
what anyone tells you.

651
00:36:17,365 --> 00:36:18,731
You make the web you're in.

652
00:36:18,783 --> 00:36:21,484
You're the spider and the fly,

653
00:36:21,569 --> 00:36:23,235
just like...

654
00:36:31,295 --> 00:36:32,661
Look, I can help.

655
00:36:32,747 --> 00:36:34,213
I can give you the exact
wording of the spell.

656
00:36:34,248 --> 00:36:35,664
It's too late.

657
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,299
It was just supposed
to be a joke.

658
00:36:37,385 --> 00:36:39,300
Yeah, bullshit.
You did it to get even.

659
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,070
Oh, fuck you!
Somebody help him.

660
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:44,089
If I had the exact spell
wording one hour ago,--

661
00:36:44,175 --> 00:36:45,474
There's got to be something.

662
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,726
You have any idea
where he is right now?

663
00:36:47,762 --> 00:36:49,228
Why would you do this?

664
00:36:49,263 --> 00:36:51,096
She didn't.

665
00:36:51,182 --> 00:36:53,649
Not by herself.
Did you?

666
00:36:59,607 --> 00:37:01,740
You sure you want to play?

667
00:37:04,946 --> 00:37:09,532
No. I'm not sure of anything.

668
00:37:09,617 --> 00:37:13,285
Except I'm tired, so tired.

669
00:37:13,337 --> 00:37:15,704
Of?

670
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:17,840
Fighting all the time,

671
00:37:17,925 --> 00:37:19,425
becoming someone that
I actually want to be,

672
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:22,628
and then realizing that I...

673
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,848
am nothing.

674
00:37:25,933 --> 00:37:27,716
So you made the hospital,

675
00:37:27,802 --> 00:37:31,186
conjured that terrible thing
you never did to your father.

676
00:37:31,272 --> 00:37:33,389
Of course you're exhausted.

677
00:37:33,474 --> 00:37:37,359
And you can hide
from it all forever

678
00:37:37,445 --> 00:37:41,146
in this lovely, quiet,
blank void.

679
00:37:41,232 --> 00:37:43,482
But you also built a way out.

680
00:37:43,568 --> 00:37:46,485
Otherwise,
why are he and I here?

681
00:37:52,293 --> 00:37:56,545
"The Madness Maker didn't
play for the joy of winning,

682
00:37:56,631 --> 00:37:59,164
"just the fear of losing.

683
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:01,884
"The real curse was, he only
played when he could win,

684
00:38:01,969 --> 00:38:06,639
"which cut him off
from the surprise,

685
00:38:06,674 --> 00:38:10,476
horror, sadness,
and wonder of life."

686
00:38:14,315 --> 00:38:18,150
"Jane saw only one way
out for him:

687
00:38:18,185 --> 00:38:21,353
"stop playing.

688
00:38:21,439 --> 00:38:24,356
Start living."

689
00:38:36,704 --> 00:38:38,671
Hey.

690
00:38:38,706 --> 00:38:39,788
Somebody woke up.

691
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:41,395
Took your damn time.

692
00:38:41,657 --> 00:38:44,259
Somebody get him some brandy.

693
00:38:44,345 --> 00:38:46,428
Flying in.

694
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,753
Wait.

695
00:38:51,821 --> 00:38:54,255
Where's the hedge bitch?

696
00:38:54,341 --> 00:38:56,975
Chop-chop.

697
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,309
They're going back up.

698
00:39:08,891 --> 00:39:11,490
You should've told me your
friend wasn't properly erased.

699
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:13,243
I know.

700
00:39:13,748 --> 00:39:14,947
And you and Eliot
never should've taken on

701
00:39:15,032 --> 00:39:16,281
the hedge witches alone.

702
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:18,784
I know.

703
00:39:18,869 --> 00:39:24,270
Quentin, do you really think
that the magic that we teach

704
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:29,178
means that you just get
to fly above right and wrong?

705
00:39:29,263 --> 00:39:31,680
Magic does not solve problems.

706
00:39:31,766 --> 00:39:33,892
It magnifies them.
I know that too.

707
00:39:34,012 --> 00:39:35,434
Believe me.

708
00:39:36,051 --> 00:39:38,552
I don't need to be taught
what magic is or isn't.

709
00:39:38,637 --> 00:39:41,438
I need to be taught magic

710
00:39:41,523 --> 00:39:45,475
so that I can decide
what it is or isn't...

711
00:39:45,561 --> 00:39:48,562
for me.

712
00:39:48,614 --> 00:39:51,732
That was almost well put.

713
00:39:53,652 --> 00:39:55,569
Good night, Quentin.

714
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:02,325
Oh, and Quentin...

715
00:40:02,411 --> 00:40:05,579
I'm glad that you're
still here with us.

716
00:40:07,666 --> 00:40:11,585
Me too, actually.

717
00:40:18,761 --> 00:40:20,844
Wow.

718
00:40:20,929 --> 00:40:22,429
Wow.

719
00:40:25,567 --> 00:40:29,352
I kind of can't believe
I ever thought I knew...

720
00:40:29,438 --> 00:40:32,572
anything.

721
00:40:32,608 --> 00:40:34,608
I'd like to share now

722
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:38,612
some of it with some of you.

723
00:40:45,337 --> 00:40:46,870
Ow!

724
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,679
Wait. Wait.

725
00:40:55,764 --> 00:40:58,298
No. No.

726
00:40:58,383 --> 00:40:59,583
I didn't get you out of there

727
00:40:59,635 --> 00:41:01,635
because you pulled one
over on me.

728
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:04,471
You and Kady bitched out,
but you'd talk.

729
00:41:04,556 --> 00:41:08,642
She can't.

730
00:41:08,727 --> 00:41:13,363
Oh, poor you and your taste
of honey worse than none at all.

731
00:41:13,449 --> 00:41:16,983
You think Brakebills
cut you off from magic?

732
00:41:17,035 --> 00:41:19,903
You don't know cut off.

733
00:41:19,988 --> 00:41:22,322
But, baby...

734
00:41:24,576 --> 00:41:26,460
<i>You will.</i>

# Mendings Major and Minor

1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,599
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:01,634 --> 00:00:02,934
You know, it should have worked.

3
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:04,469
The spell we did
to contact my brother.

4
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,557
I mean, I went over it,
like, a million times.

5
00:00:06,609 --> 00:00:08,694
Wait, you don't want
to try it again, do you?

6
00:00:08,786 --> 00:00:10,462
- No! No! No!
- I bind you!

7
00:00:10,608 --> 00:00:11,649
I bind you!

8
00:00:13,892 --> 00:00:15,531
Why did you think that
you had to save me?

9
00:00:15,611 --> 00:00:17,207
He was gonna kill you.

10
00:00:17,365 --> 00:00:19,542
I'm done here, for good.
You should be happy.

11
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:21,217
When are you gonna tell me
what all this is for?

12
00:00:21,252 --> 00:00:23,152
Bigger, better magic.

13
00:00:23,188 --> 00:00:26,056
Let's go steal their shit.

14
00:00:26,091 --> 00:00:27,891
He's not gonna wake up ever.

15
00:00:27,926 --> 00:00:29,726
Marina is a psycho.

16
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:32,728
You think Brakebills
cut you off from magic?

17
00:00:32,763 --> 00:00:34,130
Ow!

18
00:00:34,165 --> 00:00:36,132
You don't know cut off.

19
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:39,235
But you can actually move
between worlds.

20
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:41,537
If the gift does not
kill you first.

21
00:00:41,573 --> 00:00:44,073
Please, help me.

22
00:00:46,471 --> 00:00:48,310
I have a full schedule today,
Quentin.

23
00:00:48,345 --> 00:00:50,412
- What?
- Uh, I just, um...

24
00:00:50,447 --> 00:00:52,275
The point?

25
00:00:52,883 --> 00:00:54,872
What's gonna happen to Julia?

26
00:00:55,242 --> 00:00:56,852
Ah, yes.

27
00:00:57,181 --> 00:00:59,722
Your hedge witch friend.

28
00:01:02,695 --> 00:01:04,384
I'm going to kill her.

29
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,703
I, uh...

30
00:01:08,898 --> 00:01:10,532
I'm...

31
00:01:10,567 --> 00:01:13,235
I'm fucking with you, Quentin.

32
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:15,556
I'm not going
to do anything to her.

33
00:01:16,163 --> 00:01:18,906
I thought you would erase her
memory or something... again.

34
00:01:18,942 --> 00:01:22,376
Sure, then her buddies tell
her about magic all over again.

35
00:01:22,411 --> 00:01:25,073
Then she bothers me again.

36
00:01:25,218 --> 00:01:26,630
So she's just gonna
get away with it?

37
00:01:26,722 --> 00:01:29,717
I'm not the magic police,
Quentin.

38
00:01:30,153 --> 00:01:31,630
They won't be back here.

39
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:34,188
They know what'll
rain down on them if they do.

40
00:01:34,423 --> 00:01:36,224
What they do out there,
it's not my business;

41
00:01:36,259 --> 00:01:38,459
it's not yours.
Do you understand?

42
00:01:38,494 --> 00:01:40,160
Don't you worry,
Hedge witches tend

43
00:01:40,195 --> 00:01:43,535
to crash and burn
quite quickly all on their own.

44
00:01:43,917 --> 00:01:45,766
I want the spells I'm missing
so I can keep going.

45
00:01:45,801 --> 00:01:47,968
I want the new ones she stole
because I helped her.

46
00:01:48,003 --> 00:01:51,739
- You're not coming inside.
- Then bring 'em out.

47
00:01:51,774 --> 00:01:53,139
They're locked
in her filing cabinet,

48
00:01:53,175 --> 00:01:55,441
and even if I could, I wouldn't.

49
00:01:55,477 --> 00:01:57,244
I don't want
to see you get hurt,

50
00:01:57,279 --> 00:02:00,180
and Marina will hurt you.

51
00:02:00,215 --> 00:02:03,116
She only helped you get out of
Brakebills jail to save herself.

52
00:02:03,151 --> 00:02:05,518
Next time, you will not
be so lucky.

53
00:02:05,553 --> 00:02:07,921
That's bullshit.

54
00:02:07,956 --> 00:02:09,923
I earned that magic
just as much as her.

55
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:11,357
Fuck, more.

56
00:02:11,393 --> 00:02:14,460
- It was my friend that she used...
- Your friend!

57
00:02:17,231 --> 00:02:19,365
Look, Marina's the boss.
Life ain't fair.

58
00:02:19,401 --> 00:02:21,200
Woe is you. Now, please,

59
00:02:21,235 --> 00:02:23,770
leave before she sees you here.

60
00:02:30,144 --> 00:02:32,211
Think of it as applying
for an internship,

61
00:02:32,246 --> 00:02:34,880
and for outgoing students,
perhaps even a job.

62
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:38,322
Alumni come and choose
students to mentor.

63
00:02:39,253 --> 00:02:42,747
I can understand why you've
been staying here, Alice.

64
00:02:43,357 --> 00:02:45,824
I know you feel that
you've had to leave,

65
00:02:45,859 --> 00:02:49,394
but I'd really like you
to come back.

66
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,730
This is just one small corner
of the world.

67
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:53,331
There's a lot more
out there to see,

68
00:02:53,366 --> 00:02:55,148
and I'd like you to see it.

69
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:57,469
I don't much like the corners

70
00:02:57,504 --> 00:02:59,370
that I've already seen.

71
00:02:59,406 --> 00:03:03,408
Alice, students
leave every year,

72
00:03:03,443 --> 00:03:05,410
and I don't go searching
for every lost lamb.

73
00:03:05,445 --> 00:03:06,877
You didn't invite me.

74
00:03:06,913 --> 00:03:09,713
I had to sneak in
just to take the entrance exam.

75
00:03:09,749 --> 00:03:11,877
I made a mistake.

76
00:03:12,352 --> 00:03:15,219
I felt responsible for
what happened to your brother,

77
00:03:15,255 --> 00:03:17,988
and I didn't want to cause
your family another loss.

78
00:03:18,023 --> 00:03:20,324
Alice, I was wrong.

79
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:24,161
You are far too gifted
not to be with us.

80
00:03:24,196 --> 00:03:26,063
Just come back for a week,

81
00:03:26,098 --> 00:03:28,766
and if you don't like it,
then, please, by all means,

82
00:03:28,801 --> 00:03:31,034
be a farmhand.

83
00:03:33,372 --> 00:03:37,507
This year, we're going to win
the alumni week Hunger Games.

84
00:03:37,542 --> 00:03:40,710
My mentor last year was a nun.
Never again.

85
00:03:40,745 --> 00:03:42,379
I specialize in feet.

86
00:03:42,414 --> 00:03:46,549
Broken bones, warts... I have some
very interesting stuff

87
00:03:46,585 --> 00:03:48,518
for fungi of the toenail.

88
00:03:48,553 --> 00:03:50,920
99% of these mentors

89
00:03:50,956 --> 00:03:55,558
lead to a lifetime of soporific
bourgeois magic hell.

90
00:03:58,062 --> 00:03:59,451
Alice.

91
00:04:00,765 --> 00:04:02,222
You're, uh...

92
00:04:03,434 --> 00:04:04,702
Hi.

93
00:04:05,103 --> 00:04:07,512
I'm going to get a drink.

94
00:04:10,508 --> 00:04:13,142
- Is Genji your aunt?
- Oh, hey, Alice.

95
00:04:13,177 --> 00:04:15,111
- Is that Genji?
- Do you guys know her?

96
00:04:15,146 --> 00:04:17,646
Everyone does.
She runs a retreat.

97
00:04:17,681 --> 00:04:19,648
It's like Camp David for magicians.

98
00:04:19,683 --> 00:04:21,950
If Camp David
was run by Caligula.

99
00:04:23,353 --> 00:04:26,221
I mean that in the best way.

100
00:04:26,256 --> 00:04:28,394
- Excuse me.
- Wa...

101
00:04:31,962 --> 00:04:35,230
I feel really terrible about, um...

102
00:04:35,265 --> 00:04:37,658
I just thought... I wouldn't be
standing here talking to me

103
00:04:37,856 --> 00:04:39,401
if I were you.

104
00:04:39,436 --> 00:04:41,141
I don't...

105
00:04:41,971 --> 00:04:44,239
I shouldn't blame you.

106
00:04:44,558 --> 00:04:47,808
The truth is,
my brother died five years ago.

107
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,477
Still, I...

108
00:04:49,513 --> 00:04:51,642
I should go help her.

109
00:05:05,461 --> 00:05:08,295
Can anybody hear me?

110
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,355
Anybody?

111
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,888
Anybody?

112
00:05:17,806 --> 00:05:18,983
Ah.

113
00:05:20,142 --> 00:05:21,318
Penny.

114
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,546
I'm Stanley.

115
00:05:25,581 --> 00:05:26,947
I'm your mentor.

116
00:05:26,982 --> 00:05:28,615
Yeah, I didn't ask for a mentor.

117
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,016
I don't give a shit.

118
00:05:30,052 --> 00:05:33,186
You are what you are,
so I'm here.

119
00:05:33,221 --> 00:05:34,454
What, a Pisces?

120
00:05:34,489 --> 00:05:36,322
Travelers are rare.

121
00:05:36,357 --> 00:05:37,791
Hadn't been one at Brakebills

122
00:05:37,826 --> 00:05:41,044
in 35 years, I guess.

123
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,563
There's no discipline

124
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:45,831
that has more power
and possibility.

125
00:05:45,866 --> 00:05:48,234
I get it. It's an amazing gift.

126
00:05:48,269 --> 00:05:52,271
It's a terrible,
life-destroying burden.

127
00:05:59,165 --> 00:06:01,581
I zapped myself
onto Mount Everest.

128
00:06:01,616 --> 00:06:03,548
Lost my leg to frostbite.

129
00:06:03,941 --> 00:06:06,485
I'd be dead if not for one

130
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,254
deeply confused Sherpa.

131
00:06:09,943 --> 00:06:11,657
Had the lecture yet on

132
00:06:11,692 --> 00:06:13,759
sticking with astral projection?

133
00:06:13,794 --> 00:06:15,360
I don't watch "Star Trek."

134
00:06:15,395 --> 00:06:17,930
Travelers' training wheels.

135
00:06:17,965 --> 00:06:20,932
Your body stays here;
your mind travels.

136
00:06:20,967 --> 00:06:22,700
It's like being a ghost.

137
00:06:22,981 --> 00:06:24,702
Meditating

138
00:06:24,738 --> 00:06:26,971
won't stop you
from having a wet dream

139
00:06:27,007 --> 00:06:29,412
and waking up
in the Marianas Trench.

140
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:31,743
This will.

141
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:37,749
It works by binding
your body to Earth.

142
00:06:37,784 --> 00:06:40,936
Astral projection only.

143
00:06:41,371 --> 00:06:43,020
Full stop.

144
00:06:46,938 --> 00:06:49,661
Won't make the voices go away,

145
00:06:49,696 --> 00:06:52,479
but it might keep you alive.

146
00:06:54,634 --> 00:06:58,068
How could you know about all
this and become a podiatrist?

147
00:06:58,442 --> 00:07:01,305
This isn't Middle Earth, Quentin.

148
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,341
There aren't enough
noble quests to go around.

149
00:07:04,377 --> 00:07:06,843
Impress a good mentor,
and you won't have to worry.

150
00:07:07,272 --> 00:07:08,745
How am I supposed
to impress anyone?

151
00:07:08,781 --> 00:07:10,981
Mm, when you're not impressive?

152
00:07:11,016 --> 00:07:12,783
Glad you asked.

153
00:07:12,818 --> 00:07:15,418
Welters.

154
00:07:15,453 --> 00:07:17,154
- What's Welters?
- The worst.

155
00:07:17,189 --> 00:07:19,455
It's a game
designed a billion years ago

156
00:07:19,491 --> 00:07:21,858
to keep students from
killing each other in duels.

157
00:07:21,894 --> 00:07:23,293
It's like chess.

158
00:07:23,328 --> 00:07:25,127
Kind of. Not really.

159
00:07:25,163 --> 00:07:28,531
You use magic to take squares.
It's terrible.

160
00:07:28,836 --> 00:07:29,965
I don't know.
That sounds kind of fun.

161
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:32,302
- It's boring as death.
- You're boring.

162
00:07:32,337 --> 00:07:34,937
- You're boring.
- There's gonna be a tournament.

163
00:07:34,972 --> 00:07:38,107
It's supposed to be a surprise,
but I like ruining things.

164
00:07:38,142 --> 00:07:40,142
Each discipline fields a team,

165
00:07:40,178 --> 00:07:42,277
and the mentors will be watching,

166
00:07:42,313 --> 00:07:45,715
so don't screw this up for me.

167
00:08:10,874 --> 00:08:12,874
Quentin.

168
00:08:16,213 --> 00:08:19,513
Someone called the admin
office and left a message.

169
00:08:28,643 --> 00:08:30,753
My dad's sick.

170
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,568
S01E05
Mendings, Major and Minor

171
00:08:40,801 --> 00:08:44,020
sync and corrected by ninh

172
00:08:52,446 --> 00:08:54,359
Hello, Curly Q.

173
00:08:55,749 --> 00:08:57,723
Hey, Dad.

174
00:09:00,254 --> 00:09:02,524
It's brain cancer,

175
00:09:02,989 --> 00:09:05,990
but it's the good kind
of brain cancer.

176
00:09:09,362 --> 00:09:11,229
Is there anything you can do?

177
00:09:11,264 --> 00:09:13,264
Well, luckily there are
some treatment options,

178
00:09:13,299 --> 00:09:16,968
some, uh, really interesting
new therapies.

179
00:09:18,638 --> 00:09:20,444
Um, do you...

180
00:09:22,007 --> 00:09:23,474
Uh, do you feel sick?

181
00:09:23,808 --> 00:09:25,800
Eh, I feel...

182
00:09:26,145 --> 00:09:27,497
decent.

183
00:09:28,013 --> 00:09:30,814
Eh, there was some
dizziness, headaches.

184
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,906
That's why I went in.

185
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,153
- Does Mom know?
- No, she does not.

186
00:09:36,188 --> 00:09:37,933
As yet, I, uh...

187
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,158
I could come up with a reason,
I suppose,

188
00:09:41,193 --> 00:09:43,159
but the truth is, I just...

189
00:09:43,198 --> 00:09:46,196
I just don't want
to talk to her.

190
00:09:49,668 --> 00:09:51,615
I'm worried about you.

191
00:09:52,697 --> 00:09:54,638
You have brain cancer,
and you're worried about me?

192
00:09:54,673 --> 00:09:56,539
Will you stop saying "brain cancer"

193
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:59,008
like it's brain cancer?

194
00:10:02,886 --> 00:10:04,681
I never see you anymore

195
00:10:04,716 --> 00:10:07,716
since you went to this new school.

196
00:10:07,752 --> 00:10:10,186
Thinking a lot about mistakes,

197
00:10:10,221 --> 00:10:14,157
you know, things I would
do differently.

198
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:17,059
Quentin, by the time
you were ten years old,

199
00:10:17,095 --> 00:10:20,820
buddy, I couldn't sit through
one more card trick,

200
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:25,000
but if that's what makes
the world bearable to you,

201
00:10:25,035 --> 00:10:27,670
then you go off
and do card tricks.

202
00:10:27,705 --> 00:10:29,805
Don't try to be
something you're not.

203
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,174
You're studying what now?
Finance?

204
00:10:33,911 --> 00:10:36,011
You really a finance guy?

205
00:10:36,046 --> 00:10:38,647
- I'm not a kid anymore.
- Sure, yeah.

206
00:10:38,683 --> 00:10:40,982
Dump out that bag.
Go on. Dump it out.

207
00:10:41,018 --> 00:10:43,484
I'll give you 20 bucks right now
if there isn't a...

208
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,182
A "Fillory" book in there.

209
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,002
Yeah.

210
00:10:48,258 --> 00:10:51,259
You know you're still
on my insurance, right?

211
00:10:51,295 --> 00:10:53,862
You checked yourself
into a mental hospital

212
00:10:53,897 --> 00:10:56,264
a couple of months ago.
I didn't say a word.

213
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,599
I didn't say a word.
I gave you your space,

214
00:10:58,635 --> 00:11:00,568
but your prescriptions
are still coming here,

215
00:11:00,603 --> 00:11:02,837
which is how I know
you're not taking them.

216
00:11:02,872 --> 00:11:05,540
I don't need them.
I am... I'm better.

217
00:11:05,575 --> 00:11:07,742
I'm not trying
to pick a fight with you, son.

218
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:10,066
I'm just trying to...

219
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,012
fix what I broke.

220
00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:14,924
- You think I'm broken?
- No.

221
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,882
I think we are.

222
00:11:22,491 --> 00:11:24,424
Need a hand?

223
00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:27,761
We should catch up.

224
00:11:31,933 --> 00:11:34,331
I'm surprised you came back.

225
00:11:34,603 --> 00:11:36,703
I still haven't heard
about your walkabout.

226
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:38,271
Yeah, well, it wasn't
anything too exciting.

227
00:11:38,306 --> 00:11:40,139
I mostly fed
and killed chickens.

228
00:11:40,175 --> 00:11:42,743
I mean, I wanted you
to come back.

229
00:11:42,778 --> 00:11:44,444
We're friends, right?

230
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,447
Uh, I was wondering
if you could do me a tiny favor.

231
00:11:48,483 --> 00:11:50,984
I helped you find
Emily Greenstreet.

232
00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:52,618
Right.

233
00:11:52,653 --> 00:11:56,155
See, I still haven't
been selected by a mentor yet.

234
00:11:56,191 --> 00:11:58,992
I still haven't been
selected by a mentor.

235
00:11:59,027 --> 00:12:01,094
We're such good friends,
I just...

236
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:03,128
I figured you could put
a good word in to your aunt.

237
00:12:03,163 --> 00:12:05,631
If you wouldn't mind
putting in a good word for me.

238
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,900
I just feel deeply
that we are connected

239
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,402
and are meant to work together.

240
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,643
I'll see what I can do.

241
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,289
Julia? Hey.

242
00:12:18,012 --> 00:12:20,412
- Hey.
- Sorry, I'm a little early.

243
00:12:20,447 --> 00:12:22,514
I knocked a couple times.

244
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:24,777
Um, working on this big paper.

245
00:12:25,687 --> 00:12:27,986
I baked.

246
00:12:33,727 --> 00:12:36,093
That's actually good.

247
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:38,830
It's, like, people food.

248
00:12:38,865 --> 00:12:40,731
What can I say?

249
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:45,036
You have no idea
how relieved I am

250
00:12:45,071 --> 00:12:47,038
to see you like this.

251
00:12:47,073 --> 00:12:48,940
Like what?

252
00:12:48,975 --> 00:12:50,207
A happy housewife?

253
00:12:50,243 --> 00:12:52,625
Better. Not, uh...

254
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:54,812
High all the time?

255
00:12:54,847 --> 00:12:57,548
I was gonna put it
a bit more delicately than that.

256
00:13:01,687 --> 00:13:03,117
Dad?

257
00:13:05,191 --> 00:13:07,404
Dad?

258
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,733
We need to go to the hospital.

259
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:19,470
No, they'll just send me home.

260
00:13:19,505 --> 00:13:22,506
I'm fine.
They need to adjust your meds.

261
00:13:22,696 --> 00:13:25,388
I'm not taking any meds, Quentin.

262
00:13:26,744 --> 00:13:28,578
How bad is it?

263
00:13:28,613 --> 00:13:31,414
I have a glioblastoma.

264
00:13:33,051 --> 00:13:36,219
It's the most common type
of brain tumor.

265
00:13:37,855 --> 00:13:39,489
It's also the most severe.

266
00:13:39,889 --> 00:13:41,257
But it's treatable?

267
00:13:41,293 --> 00:13:42,692
There are treatments available.

268
00:13:42,727 --> 00:13:45,795
I chose not to pursue them.

269
00:13:52,883 --> 00:13:54,604
You know, I Googled brain tumors

270
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,573
just in general,

271
00:13:57,609 --> 00:13:59,741
and one common denominator
that jumps out at you

272
00:13:59,776 --> 00:14:01,243
is impaired cognitive function,

273
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:04,213
so maybe you deciding
not to pursue treatment

274
00:14:04,248 --> 00:14:08,146
- without talking...
- My doctors agree with me, Q.

275
00:14:08,652 --> 00:14:12,587
The type of tumor it is,
where it's located...

276
00:14:12,816 --> 00:14:15,415
the person who comes
out of surgery...

277
00:14:16,793 --> 00:14:18,512
might not be me.

278
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,094
I don't want you to die.

279
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:23,431
Yeah, I'm not too crazy
about it myself.

280
00:14:23,466 --> 00:14:25,530
Then why are you giving up?

281
00:14:38,969 --> 00:14:40,948
You remember this?

282
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:49,322
My dad and I used to build
model airplanes.

283
00:14:51,961 --> 00:14:53,561
And this,

284
00:14:53,596 --> 00:14:56,163
this was my absolute favorite.

285
00:14:56,198 --> 00:14:58,029
Tenth birthday.

286
00:14:58,634 --> 00:15:01,101
This is a Nieuport 28.

287
00:15:01,136 --> 00:15:02,803
It's the same plane
Quentin Roosevelt flew

288
00:15:02,838 --> 00:15:04,904
in World War I.

289
00:15:06,175 --> 00:15:09,295
When you were
about two years old,

290
00:15:09,811 --> 00:15:11,144
you got your hands on this,

291
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,907
and you broke off
one of the wings.

292
00:15:15,684 --> 00:15:18,585
I spent about an hour
with a hot glue gun

293
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,382
trying to fix it.

294
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:22,816
It ended up in

295
00:15:23,058 --> 00:15:25,625
about 20 pieces instead of 2.

296
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,064
Quentin,

297
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:30,663
sometimes trying to fix
something only makes it worse.

298
00:15:35,036 --> 00:15:37,803
They match my 401k up to 6%.

299
00:15:37,838 --> 00:15:40,468
- It's just... it's crazy.
- Dr. Meers?

300
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:43,700
Oh, excuse me.

301
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:46,845
My father's dying,

302
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,911
and I need you to fix him.

303
00:15:49,775 --> 00:15:52,097
If magicians could cure cancer

304
00:15:52,189 --> 00:15:54,355
why would anybody have cancer?

305
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:57,025
Because we like secrets.

306
00:15:58,661 --> 00:16:00,461
There's got to be
some kind of spell.

307
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,296
Amazing things are possible,

308
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,398
but cancer,

309
00:16:04,534 --> 00:16:06,367
it's a part of you,

310
00:16:06,402 --> 00:16:07,869
intrinsically, in a way

311
00:16:07,904 --> 00:16:11,205
that magic can't separate.

312
00:16:11,241 --> 00:16:14,006
Some people think it is magic,

313
00:16:14,968 --> 00:16:17,511
an old curse we can't break.

314
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:19,714
So then, somebody
must have tried.

315
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:21,449
I mean, look, even
if it's experimental, I...

316
00:16:21,484 --> 00:16:24,785
Do you know why Dean Fogg
didn't fix his eyes?

317
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,554
I guess I just assumed
he couldn't.

318
00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:27,855
Treating something like that

319
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:31,632
requires an enormous amount
of energy,

320
00:16:32,094 --> 00:16:34,128
and that comes at a cost.

321
00:16:34,163 --> 00:16:36,368
So does everything.

322
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:40,576
I can give you the names
of some journal articles.

323
00:16:41,804 --> 00:16:43,403
Thank you.

324
00:16:43,438 --> 00:16:45,405
Fair warning...

325
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,408
what you're looking for
might be impossible,

326
00:16:48,443 --> 00:16:49,942
and it will require

327
00:16:49,978 --> 00:16:52,979
far more energy
than you can muster.

328
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,323
I love you.

329
00:17:04,744 --> 00:17:06,558
Oh...

330
00:17:06,594 --> 00:17:09,095
you baked.

331
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:12,165
You can have one,
if you think you can afford it.

332
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,669
Please, I have the metabolism
of a Jamaican sprinter,

333
00:17:16,704 --> 00:17:19,405
and I need my strength

334
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,309
so I can properly wrap this
bottle of double charmed sake

335
00:17:23,344 --> 00:17:27,446
you can only get from a very
particular monk on Okinawa.

336
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:32,984
But I'm sure Genji is gonna
love your little cakes.

337
00:17:38,525 --> 00:17:42,294
This is war, bitch.

338
00:18:24,572 --> 00:18:25,680
Ow.

339
00:18:25,786 --> 00:18:28,805
You should know better
than to mess with Google magic,

340
00:18:28,841 --> 00:18:31,808
and starting an invisible fire
in your apartment,

341
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,810
still a fire.

342
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:35,712
You got lucky.

343
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,414
Pete,

344
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:40,516
there's nothing else
for me to be besides this.

345
00:18:40,551 --> 00:18:44,220
There's a whole world
of things besides this.

346
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,189
I almost burned down
my apartment,

347
00:18:46,224 --> 00:18:48,512
and all I can think about
is trying it again.

348
00:18:48,631 --> 00:18:51,027
Pete, there is nothing else.

349
00:18:52,563 --> 00:18:55,865
Your boyfriend could have
done this for you.

350
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,867
I just got this stuff at Target.

351
00:18:57,902 --> 00:18:59,535
Not that I'm complaining.

352
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:02,438
You know, a beautiful girl calls you
in the middle of the night,

353
00:19:02,473 --> 00:19:05,107
never mind she's
a little intense...

354
00:19:07,311 --> 00:19:08,841
You answer.

355
00:19:34,443 --> 00:19:37,271
There are other hedges

356
00:19:37,504 --> 00:19:39,273
and other safe houses.

357
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:41,462
I want to know where.

358
00:20:01,697 --> 00:20:03,327
Quentin?

359
00:20:04,171 --> 00:20:05,781
Quentin!

360
00:20:06,335 --> 00:20:07,901
Where have you been?

361
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:11,137
You're late,
and this is mandatory!

362
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:16,443
Welters is a game of circumstances.

363
00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:18,111
Simply put,

364
00:20:18,146 --> 00:20:21,581
we beat that squad
of flower-power ass-clowns

365
00:20:21,616 --> 00:20:24,650
by casting
to capture those squares,

366
00:20:24,686 --> 00:20:27,087
but the squares
won't make that easy.

367
00:20:27,122 --> 00:20:30,190
Each one represents
a different location

368
00:20:30,225 --> 00:20:32,192
and a different
set of circumstances,

369
00:20:32,227 --> 00:20:34,260
so you can't just cast.

370
00:20:34,296 --> 00:20:35,928
You actually have to know
how to cast

371
00:20:35,964 --> 00:20:37,697
for those complications,

372
00:20:37,732 --> 00:20:40,600
then adjust in a dozen ways.

373
00:20:40,635 --> 00:20:42,835
If you get any one of them wrong,

374
00:20:42,871 --> 00:20:44,704
the whole thing goes to hell.

375
00:21:16,904 --> 00:21:18,703
Will you stop
saying "brain cancer"

376
00:21:18,739 --> 00:21:21,706
like it's brain cancer?

377
00:21:21,742 --> 00:21:24,342
Sometimes trying to fix
something only makes it worse.

378
00:21:24,377 --> 00:21:26,177
- Quentin.
- Quentin.

379
00:21:26,212 --> 00:21:28,012
- Quentin.
- Quentin.

380
00:21:28,048 --> 00:21:30,014
Quentin!

381
00:21:33,053 --> 00:21:35,986
Get your head out of your twat
and throw the damn globe.

382
00:21:52,168 --> 00:21:53,737
Are you okay?

383
00:21:53,923 --> 00:21:55,479
I'm fine.

384
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,550
Oh!

385
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:19,128
Are you sure
you want to do that?

386
00:22:42,953 --> 00:22:45,921
Q, are you controlling this?

387
00:22:45,956 --> 00:22:48,090
Do something, Q!

388
00:23:11,096 --> 00:23:14,601
One spell so powerful,
it wiped the whole board.

389
00:23:14,667 --> 00:23:15,852
To Quentin!

390
00:23:19,797 --> 00:23:22,104
Q, come on. Celebrate.

391
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,006
Who knew you had it in you?

392
00:23:24,042 --> 00:23:27,310
Easily worth whatever it's gonna
cost to replace the roof.

393
00:23:27,346 --> 00:23:28,744
I don't care.

394
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:30,947
I get your dad is sick,

395
00:23:30,982 --> 00:23:34,683
but like it or not, you still
have to think about your future,

396
00:23:34,719 --> 00:23:36,118
and this matters for that.

397
00:23:36,154 --> 00:23:37,519
One of the mentors
came up to me after the game

398
00:23:37,555 --> 00:23:38,855
and asked me to come
to the Fertile Crescent

399
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,656
to stalk a river dragon.

400
00:23:40,691 --> 00:23:43,125
I said no, 'cause grand scheme,

401
00:23:43,161 --> 00:23:44,593
none of that matters.

402
00:23:44,628 --> 00:23:47,295
Why do you think
you were able to do that?

403
00:23:47,331 --> 00:23:49,531
Please tell me someone
has pointed out to you

404
00:23:49,567 --> 00:23:52,668
that magic doesn't come
from sunshine and ice cream,

405
00:23:52,703 --> 00:23:54,703
for any of us.

406
00:23:57,241 --> 00:23:59,508
What you're born with,

407
00:23:59,543 --> 00:24:02,210
what gets slammed
on you as a kid,

408
00:24:02,246 --> 00:24:04,645
what happens now,
like your dad...

409
00:24:07,684 --> 00:24:11,052
A great way
to get the things you want

410
00:24:11,088 --> 00:24:13,993
is to be so miserable,

411
00:24:14,258 --> 00:24:16,342
you don't want them anymore.

412
00:24:16,593 --> 00:24:18,967
What kind of system is that?

413
00:24:19,763 --> 00:24:21,953
You know, why can't it run on...

414
00:24:22,164 --> 00:24:24,038
love...

415
00:24:24,434 --> 00:24:27,301
or cocaine or something?

416
00:24:29,672 --> 00:24:32,560
It's the universe deep-dicking us.

417
00:24:33,109 --> 00:24:35,409
Lie back and try and enjoy it.

418
00:24:46,889 --> 00:24:49,223
- Hi there.
- Hello.

419
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:53,159
- Pete sent me.
- Uh...

420
00:24:54,696 --> 00:24:57,697
- Show us your stars.
- I can do you one better.

421
00:25:02,738 --> 00:25:04,604
Um...

422
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,440
Uh, yeah. Um...

423
00:25:06,663 --> 00:25:08,180
Welcome.

424
00:25:10,578 --> 00:25:13,272
So... what's your name?

425
00:25:17,218 --> 00:25:19,185
Wa... this is it?

426
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,687
- How do you mean?
- This is all you have?

427
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:25,558
Well, if you know so much,
why don't you show us?

428
00:25:25,593 --> 00:25:28,243
No, I didn't come here to teach.

429
00:25:29,163 --> 00:25:31,950
At least show us that
cool cloud thing again?

430
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,534
Oh, my God.

431
00:25:38,138 --> 00:25:40,038
What day of the week is it?

432
00:25:40,074 --> 00:25:42,807
Ah, you are asking
the wrong guy.

433
00:25:51,251 --> 00:25:53,218
What is this?

434
00:25:57,086 --> 00:25:59,390
You joining the navy?

435
00:26:01,461 --> 00:26:02,824
Hey...

436
00:26:03,697 --> 00:26:05,437
what's wrong?

437
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,094
It's to stop myself from
traveling to an early grave.

438
00:26:12,825 --> 00:26:14,905
Come on,
you're looking at it all wrong.

439
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,242
Look, every idiot on the planet

440
00:26:18,277 --> 00:26:20,511
busts their ass. For what?

441
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:24,015
To buy the freedom
that you got for free.

442
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:26,417
It's not free if I can't control it.

443
00:26:26,452 --> 00:26:28,919
Well, then figure out how.

444
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:32,188
If you do, you could go
anywhere, any time.

445
00:26:32,366 --> 00:26:34,658
I mean, look, not for nothing,

446
00:26:34,693 --> 00:26:38,028
but you could be the
greatest thief who ever lived.

447
00:26:39,532 --> 00:26:41,258
I'm serious.

448
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:45,301
- Come on.
- What am I gonna steal?

449
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:47,653
Hmm, well...

450
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,939
Could start by stealing me
a sandwich.

451
00:26:54,922 --> 00:26:56,279
The day drinking losers

452
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:59,549
absolutely do not fulfill
the terms of our agreement.

453
00:27:00,985 --> 00:27:02,711
Our agreement?

454
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,257
I want somewhere better,

455
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:07,830
some place with real magic.

456
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:12,327
Please.

457
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:16,298
It's the number two
safe house in the city.

458
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:18,067
What? In all of New York?

459
00:27:18,102 --> 00:27:21,703
- A city of 8 million people?
- They got good magic.

460
00:27:21,738 --> 00:27:23,338
It's not their fault that

461
00:27:23,374 --> 00:27:24,806
they're the tortoise
and you're the hare.

462
00:27:24,841 --> 00:27:26,175
They're not even in the race.

463
00:27:26,210 --> 00:27:28,043
Look, you want something better,

464
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,879
get out of town;
go to where the talent is.

465
00:27:30,914 --> 00:27:33,748
You think the safe house
in Hoboken's gonna be better?

466
00:27:35,886 --> 00:27:39,253
There's this place
in the Mali desert.

467
00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:42,657
The marabouts have
this object magic

468
00:27:42,693 --> 00:27:44,740
like nothing we have here.

469
00:27:45,762 --> 00:27:47,286
We could go.

470
00:27:47,564 --> 00:27:49,701
- Together.
- Oh.

471
00:27:50,133 --> 00:27:51,323
Can't.

472
00:27:51,935 --> 00:27:53,463
Why?

473
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:55,936
Because I love my boyfriend.

474
00:27:55,972 --> 00:27:59,044
You slept with me two days ago.

475
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:01,115
You're welcome.

476
00:28:01,611 --> 00:28:05,179
That's a pretty loose fucking
definition of love.

477
00:28:05,215 --> 00:28:07,515
What, you think that
you and James

478
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:10,417
are gonna grow old together?

479
00:28:10,452 --> 00:28:12,953
He doesn't know the most
important thing about you.

480
00:28:12,989 --> 00:28:14,287
- Then I'll tell him.
- You can't.

481
00:28:14,323 --> 00:28:16,288
Why? Marina's rules?

482
00:28:16,324 --> 00:28:19,258
Because it's dangerous,
for both of you.

483
00:28:19,293 --> 00:28:20,860
Marina's rules no longer apply.

484
00:28:20,895 --> 00:28:22,695
Julia, you're making a mistake.

485
00:28:22,731 --> 00:28:24,909
Give me spells, and I won't do it.

486
00:28:26,018 --> 00:28:27,640
Right.

487
00:28:45,217 --> 00:28:46,956
Please help.

488
00:28:47,115 --> 00:28:48,474
Okay, I hear you.

489
00:28:48,579 --> 00:28:50,088
Please help me.

490
00:28:51,983 --> 00:28:53,825
Please come for me.

491
00:28:55,716 --> 00:28:57,627
Please help.

492
00:28:57,663 --> 00:29:00,830
- Who the fuck are you?
- Let me out of here!

493
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:02,598
- Lady!
- Someone help me.

494
00:29:02,634 --> 00:29:04,534
Come on, can you hear me?

495
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:17,112
Please help! Please help me!

496
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:21,511
Let me out of here.

497
00:29:22,253 --> 00:29:25,349
You can't keep doing this to me.

498
00:29:28,752 --> 00:29:30,204
Whoa.

499
00:29:31,364 --> 00:29:33,364
Okay.

500
00:29:34,122 --> 00:29:36,633
Astral projection.

501
00:29:38,704 --> 00:29:40,948
All right, safety first.

502
00:29:44,734 --> 00:29:46,410
Please.

503
00:29:46,502 --> 00:29:48,573
- Help.
- Hello?

504
00:29:50,248 --> 00:29:51,682
Hello?

505
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:05,861
No...

506
00:30:05,897 --> 00:30:07,530
Let me out of here!

507
00:30:07,565 --> 00:30:11,734
You sound talkative today, Victoria.

508
00:30:13,563 --> 00:30:15,771
Are you ready to talk?

509
00:30:18,246 --> 00:30:20,370
I can wait all day.

510
00:30:36,645 --> 00:30:38,111
Hey!

511
00:30:38,147 --> 00:30:39,973
You lied to me.

512
00:30:41,622 --> 00:30:43,815
First one in 35 years?

513
00:30:44,086 --> 00:30:46,586
Yes, there was a girl
several years ago.

514
00:30:46,621 --> 00:30:48,120
Yeah, well, I saw her,

515
00:30:48,156 --> 00:30:50,456
while I was astral ghosting
into some dungeon.

516
00:30:50,492 --> 00:30:52,325
Turns out she's part of that

517
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,394
incredibly famous third year class,

518
00:30:54,429 --> 00:30:56,996
the missing third year class.

519
00:30:57,031 --> 00:30:59,932
I didn't know
what happened to her.

520
00:30:59,967 --> 00:31:02,067
I figured she was dead.

521
00:31:04,839 --> 00:31:07,505
You're supposed to be
my fucking mentor.

522
00:31:08,009 --> 00:31:10,403
What the hell
do you want from me?

523
00:31:11,378 --> 00:31:12,805
Christ!

524
00:31:14,849 --> 00:31:17,683
- Can you get her back?
- Can I?

525
00:31:17,718 --> 00:31:19,118
I don't know where
the hell she is.

526
00:31:19,153 --> 00:31:20,652
You're the one who saw her,

527
00:31:20,688 --> 00:31:22,975
and it's not my problem.

528
00:31:23,557 --> 00:31:25,457
My advice?

529
00:31:25,492 --> 00:31:28,120
Get that tattoo
as soon as possible.

530
00:31:34,968 --> 00:31:39,170
♪ No more smoke
on the dance floor ♪

531
00:31:39,404 --> 00:31:40,671
What's your poison?

532
00:31:40,707 --> 00:31:43,875
Um, I don't know.
I just poured something.

533
00:31:44,786 --> 00:31:45,609
Yuck.

534
00:31:45,645 --> 00:31:48,313
I have so much to teach you
about drinking.

535
00:31:48,348 --> 00:31:50,481
It's a three-year program.
Graduate level.

536
00:31:50,516 --> 00:31:52,688
It begins immediately.

537
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,685
Relax.

538
00:31:54,721 --> 00:31:58,055
This isn't some mentor week
full-court press.

539
00:31:58,387 --> 00:32:00,491
- Oh.
- Yeah.

540
00:32:00,526 --> 00:32:04,662
Friends don't let friends drink
Long Island iced tea, Alice.

541
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,633
Eliot, I... oh, sorry.

542
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:11,235
Sorry.

543
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:14,238
Um, Alice, do you mind if I just
borrow Eliot for a second?

544
00:32:14,273 --> 00:32:15,719
Mm.

545
00:32:16,959 --> 00:32:18,708
How may I help you, sir?

546
00:32:18,744 --> 00:32:21,220
What do you know
about Cancer Puppy?

547
00:32:21,747 --> 00:32:23,186
Okay.

548
00:32:24,683 --> 00:32:25,815
Okay.

549
00:32:25,851 --> 00:32:29,352
Oh, yes.

550
00:32:29,388 --> 00:32:30,987
His name is Gerald,

551
00:32:31,022 --> 00:32:33,656
but everyone calls him
Cancer Puppy.

552
00:32:33,692 --> 00:32:36,726
He's sort of our
unofficial mascot.

553
00:32:36,762 --> 00:32:38,261
Why does he have cancer?

554
00:32:38,296 --> 00:32:40,997
Because he's 150, Quentin.

555
00:32:41,032 --> 00:32:42,899
The enchantment just
keeps him a puppy forever;

556
00:32:42,934 --> 00:32:44,700
it doesn't stop him
from being riddled

557
00:32:44,735 --> 00:32:47,103
with every single disease it's
possible to be riddled with.

558
00:32:47,138 --> 00:32:50,539
They've been taking him to
a very confused veterinarian

559
00:32:50,574 --> 00:32:53,283
in Ogdensburg. Yes.

560
00:32:56,414 --> 00:32:57,887
Hi.

561
00:32:59,417 --> 00:33:01,700
What if I could fix you?

562
00:33:02,085 --> 00:33:05,086
You're going to cure
Cancer Puppy?

563
00:33:07,291 --> 00:33:08,624
I found a spell that might work,

564
00:33:08,659 --> 00:33:10,956
but it requires a lot of energy,

565
00:33:12,329 --> 00:33:14,596
and I think I might
have that right now.

566
00:33:25,242 --> 00:33:26,732
A little.

567
00:33:38,621 --> 00:33:40,219
Hi.

568
00:33:42,172 --> 00:33:44,459
Okay.

569
00:33:45,087 --> 00:33:46,290
Okay.

570
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,442
Oh, no.

571
00:34:01,477 --> 00:34:03,775
You killed Cancer Puppy?

572
00:34:04,197 --> 00:34:06,546
I was trying to cure him.

573
00:34:08,116 --> 00:34:10,750
The spell you were
attempting to cast is part of

574
00:34:10,786 --> 00:34:13,186
a class of magic strictly
forbidden for all students.

575
00:34:13,221 --> 00:34:15,622
It is also strictly forbidden
for everyone else.

576
00:34:15,657 --> 00:34:17,491
- I was just...
- The best magicians

577
00:34:17,526 --> 00:34:19,425
in the world couldn't work
that spell, and yet you thought

578
00:34:19,461 --> 00:34:21,160
a middling
first year student could.

579
00:34:21,196 --> 00:34:23,101
I had to try.

580
00:34:32,177 --> 00:34:33,536
Why didn't you fix your eyes?

581
00:34:33,602 --> 00:34:36,642
The glasses show me outlines.
I can live with that.

582
00:34:36,677 --> 00:34:39,378
If I had to choose between
my eyes or my hands,

583
00:34:39,413 --> 00:34:41,865
I'd rather be able to cast.

584
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:46,484
It's on the first page of your
first textbook, Quentin.

585
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,319
"As magicians,

586
00:34:48,354 --> 00:34:50,388
"we are the instrument
and the medium.

587
00:34:50,423 --> 00:34:52,390
We are the chisel
and the marble."

588
00:34:52,425 --> 00:34:54,526
- I read it. I just...
- But you didn't listen,

589
00:34:54,561 --> 00:34:55,894
did you?

590
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:59,230
Yes, you can
save someone's eyes.

591
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:00,798
You can even save
someone's life,

592
00:35:00,834 --> 00:35:03,734
but you might alter
their soul in the process.

593
00:35:04,293 --> 00:35:06,029
Then why bother?

594
00:35:07,072 --> 00:35:09,140
What is the point
of any of this, of magic,

595
00:35:09,175 --> 00:35:11,675
if we can't fix real problems?

596
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:15,712
We can fix some things.

597
00:35:17,016 --> 00:35:19,262
So we fix what we can.

598
00:35:22,755 --> 00:35:25,088
Get rid of the flare!

599
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,223
Get the kids!

600
00:35:27,259 --> 00:35:29,225
Get rid of the flare!

601
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,830
Hail Mary, full of grace.
The Lord be with you.

602
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:43,210
Dad?

603
00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:50,053
- Dad?
- Yeah...

604
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,518
Hmm? It's okay.

605
00:35:56,554 --> 00:35:58,921
I'm just, uh...
I'm just a little tired.

606
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:02,692
Curly Q,

607
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,700
what's going on?

608
00:36:06,244 --> 00:36:08,051
You were right.

609
00:36:08,665 --> 00:36:10,532
You do know your kid,

610
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:12,568
at least a little.

611
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:15,497
I could give a shit about finance.

612
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:20,609
You know I just
want you to be happy.

613
00:36:20,644 --> 00:36:22,578
I know. I get that. I do.

614
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:24,245
Come on.

615
00:37:09,344 --> 00:37:10,991
This is where I've been.

616
00:37:17,581 --> 00:37:19,299

623
00:37:43,825 --> 00:37:46,625
Okay, let me stop you
one quick second.

confused for someone else.

some sort of sick revenge

635
00:38:25,406 --> 00:38:26,820
because I wouldn't
screw you again?

637
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,990
No, of course you didn't.
Marina did.

643

644
00:38:40,205 --> 00:38:41,268
You want everybody's help.

645

You want to stand
on our shoulders,

646
00:38:42,971 --> 00:38:46,606
and you haven't, not once,
taken any of our advice.

647
00:38:46,642 --> 00:38:49,347

let you into Brakebills.

Dears, while you are both
quite impressive,

663
00:39:44,163 --> 00:39:47,265
honestly, the thought
of working with you exhausts me,

664
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:50,268

my looks in that way.

31
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,829
Hey!

32
00:01:17,863 --> 00:01:19,098
Alice, I-

33
00:01:19,132 --> 00:01:22,271
ugh!

34
00:02:09,134 --> 00:02:10,235
M.E. thinks it was
some kind of

35
00:02:10,236 --> 00:02:12,206
very rare brain hemorrhage.

36
00:02:12,207 --> 00:02:13,709
Your friend have a history
of that kind of thing?

37
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,281
She wasn't my friend.

38
00:02:16,315 --> 00:02:18,586
Then why are you crying?

39
00:02:18,587 --> 00:02:20,723
I don't know.

40
00:02:20,758 --> 00:02:24,264
Anyway, you're free to go.

41
00:02:24,299 --> 00:02:25,800
Somebody waiting out here
to pick you up.

42
00:02:25,801 --> 00:02:29,041
Says she's your sister.

43
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,290
<i>That happened, right?</i>

44
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:41,298
We flew...

45
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:43,336
here to Antarctica?

46
00:02:46,811 --> 00:02:48,513
I don't want to lose it-

47
00:02:48,514 --> 00:02:50,250
how it felt.

48
00:02:50,285 --> 00:02:53,156
I-it-
the sky, it, uh-

49
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:55,628
It's like you could feel it

50
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:59,202
inside the air.

51
00:02:59,236 --> 00:03:01,239
Part of it-
all of it, like-

52
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,610
Everything fit...

53
00:03:03,646 --> 00:03:05,882
all by itself.

54
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:18,241
Penny, can we-

55
00:03:18,275 --> 00:03:20,378
Birds.

56
00:03:20,413 --> 00:03:22,716
I never shit so much in my life.

57
00:03:22,717 --> 00:03:26,724
But at least I got
to eat bugs, so...that.

58
00:03:26,725 --> 00:03:31,434
Now snow.
God, I hate snow.

59
00:03:31,468 --> 00:03:33,939
Hey, you were told
to report here, right?

60
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,476
By that TA or whatever?

61
00:03:35,477 --> 00:03:37,212
Uh, yeah.

62
00:03:37,246 --> 00:03:41,588
I saw him herd another six
or seven kids into the library.

63
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:44,627
So what is this then?

64
00:03:44,662 --> 00:03:46,732
We're here to study
with Mayakovsky.

65
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:51,053
- Who I hear is crazy.
- You heard wrong.

66
00:03:54,783 --> 00:03:57,888
Sit.

67
00:03:57,922 --> 00:03:59,257
I do not ask

68
00:03:59,258 --> 00:04:02,330
and I do not order twice.

69
00:04:14,456 --> 00:04:16,425
I hate you.

70
00:04:18,531 --> 00:04:21,369
I hate all of you.

71
00:04:21,403 --> 00:04:23,641
And you know why?

72
00:04:26,681 --> 00:04:28,384
It's the Hammer Charm
of Legrand.

73
00:04:28,385 --> 00:04:29,653
We know this.

74
00:04:29,654 --> 00:04:31,557
I hate all of you

75
00:04:31,591 --> 00:04:35,965
because you don't know anything.

76
00:04:35,999 --> 00:04:38,504
You learn magic like

77
00:04:38,538 --> 00:04:41,777
parrot learns Shakespeare:
tricks for birdseeds.

78
00:04:41,778 --> 00:04:44,349
You are all clever pets.

79
00:04:44,383 --> 00:04:46,553
You.

80
00:04:46,588 --> 00:04:48,692
Sultry-But-Damaged.

81
00:04:48,726 --> 00:04:52,198
What is the Hammer Charm
of Legrand?

82
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,770
It's, um-
it's the-

83
00:04:54,805 --> 00:04:57,409
One day your looks
will be gone like that

84
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:00,582
and unless there's
a brain behind

85
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:04,790
those batting eyelashes

86
00:05:04,825 --> 00:05:07,062
you will be selling oranges

87
00:05:07,063 --> 00:05:09,400
at an off-ramp.

88
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,471
It's a spell that makes
nails go into boards

89
00:05:11,472 --> 00:05:13,608
perfectly straight.

90
00:05:17,952 --> 00:05:20,022
You think you know
how to do this,

91
00:05:20,023 --> 00:05:22,693
I assure you, you do not.

92
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:27,323
<i>Ein saat schlug tief-</i>

93
00:05:34,887 --> 00:05:38,092
Your voices are your enemies.

94
00:05:38,126 --> 00:05:40,664
A great Magician-

95
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:43,169
and as you gaze
into your mirrors

96
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,006
in the coming years,

97
00:05:45,007 --> 00:05:47,678
you may recall that I

98
00:05:47,713 --> 00:05:51,219
was the last great Magician
you ever saw,

99
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:56,563
a great Magician is magic

100
00:05:56,597 --> 00:05:58,333
in his bones,

101
00:05:58,368 --> 00:06:00,004
blood, heart,

102
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:02,008
and dick.

103
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:05,014
Or lady parts.
Whatever.

104
00:06:06,852 --> 00:06:09,823
Begin.

105
00:06:29,201 --> 00:06:35,201
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny

106
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:48,936
Does this say "Ibiza"?

107
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,272
Yes,

108
00:06:50,307 --> 00:06:53,813
but this...

109
00:06:53,848 --> 00:06:56,017
screams "Ibiza."

110
00:06:58,991 --> 00:07:00,961
Hey, so Ibiza...

111
00:07:00,995 --> 00:07:02,163
Is a place-

112
00:07:02,164 --> 00:07:03,800
That we're going to.

113
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:06,304
<i>I'm hearing Encanto Octulo
this year</i>

114
00:07:06,305 --> 00:07:09,478
is gonna be, like,
off the chain,

115
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:11,649
but you have to be invited

116
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,153
by people who've been...

117
00:07:13,154 --> 00:07:15,557
And you guys have both been.

118
00:07:15,558 --> 00:07:18,163
- Twice.
- Right.

119
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,908
Margo, you look so beautiful.

120
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:25,611
Uh, I-I can't even-

121
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,916
I got this.

122
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,452
Tell me your name again.

123
00:07:29,453 --> 00:07:31,757
- Todd.
- Todd.

124
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,360
Here's the thing.

125
00:07:33,361 --> 00:07:37,535
<i>Encanto Oculto
is a solid week of sun,</i>

126
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:39,539
drugs, and magical art.

127
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,412
Time stops, reality bends,

128
00:07:42,446 --> 00:07:44,316
and you fuck five times a day.

129
00:07:44,317 --> 00:07:45,585
On a bad day.

130
00:07:45,586 --> 00:07:47,388
It sounds awesome.

131
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:49,125
It is, Todd.

132
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,700
It is awesome, but honestly,

133
00:07:52,734 --> 00:07:54,637
you'd end up in a corner alone.

134
00:07:54,638 --> 00:07:58,445
Bitter.
Bumming everyone out.

135
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,317
Like last year at the bacchanal.

136
00:08:01,318 --> 00:08:04,190
Poor-
Wait, what was his name?

137
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:06,294
- Um-
- Hmm.

138
00:08:06,328 --> 00:08:08,331
- Todd.
- Todd.

139
00:08:08,366 --> 00:08:10,402
How weird is that?

140
00:08:10,436 --> 00:08:14,443
Todd, you don't want to
end up like the other Todd.

141
00:08:14,444 --> 00:08:17,349
What happened to him?

142
00:08:17,384 --> 00:08:19,821
He just wasn't
meant to be there.

143
00:08:19,822 --> 00:08:23,729
He moped and whined
and brought everything down.

144
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,200
Okay, we were a little wrecked,

145
00:08:26,201 --> 00:08:29,875
and for fun, someone-

146
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:32,580
- someone not us...
- No, not us.

147
00:08:32,581 --> 00:08:37,141
- Turned Todd into a pig.
- And we ate him.

148
00:08:38,327 --> 00:08:43,067
Wait, are you guys
messing with me right now?

149
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:46,543
Okay.

150
00:08:46,577 --> 00:08:49,014
Well, I'm just gonna...

151
00:08:49,048 --> 00:08:52,153
I'm gonna...

152
00:08:55,195 --> 00:08:59,702
Oh, my God.

153
00:08:59,737 --> 00:09:01,373
Okay, focus.

154
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:04,746
<i>Last thing: the regalo.</i>

155
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,351
The re-what-now?

156
00:09:07,386 --> 00:09:08,587
The gift to the elders

157
00:09:08,588 --> 00:09:10,090
footing the bill
for the debauchery.

158
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,495
Right.
What did we get them last year?

159
00:09:12,496 --> 00:09:14,933
An actual, working bag of dicks.

160
00:09:14,934 --> 00:09:17,104
Right.
It was lame.

161
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,410
You got anything?

162
00:09:19,444 --> 00:09:20,745
You?

163
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,616
I wrote something down.

164
00:09:22,617 --> 00:09:25,188
These TA's were whispering,

165
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:28,962
so I figured it had to be good.

166
00:09:28,997 --> 00:09:31,634
They were talking about-yes.

167
00:09:31,635 --> 00:09:33,772
"How to make magical gin."

168
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:36,076
Mmm, gin and tonic.

169
00:09:36,111 --> 00:09:37,780
Strong, classic.

170
00:09:37,815 --> 00:09:40,118
No one kicks that out
of a party.

171
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:41,187
Me likey.

172
00:09:41,221 --> 00:09:43,291
Good, but this you hatey.

173
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:44,961
I only got part of the spell.

174
00:09:44,962 --> 00:09:49,582
We have to dig out the rest
in the library.

175
00:11:39,262 --> 00:11:43,502
Why don't you two just fuck?

176
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:49,414
No?

177
00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:51,953
Then try this:

178
00:11:51,987 --> 00:11:53,890
work!

179
00:12:03,748 --> 00:12:05,346
I'm fine, okay

180
00:12:05,473 --> 00:12:08,077
I'm just-

181
00:12:08,111 --> 00:12:10,849
I got hooked up with
some sketchy people,

182
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:13,622
but I'm fine.
Okay?

183
00:12:17,497 --> 00:12:20,736
I'll get to this tomorrow.

184
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:24,568
Blood's not going to
come out of that sweater.

185
00:12:24,569 --> 00:12:25,570
You should just throw it out.

186
00:12:25,571 --> 00:12:27,341
Okay, thanks...

187
00:12:30,782 --> 00:12:34,221
For getting me home.

188
00:12:34,256 --> 00:12:35,792
I'll call you.

189
00:12:35,793 --> 00:12:37,494
- I'm staying.
- What?

190
00:12:37,495 --> 00:12:40,000
To make sure you're okay.

191
00:12:40,001 --> 00:12:42,104
You really don't
have to do that, I'm-

192
00:12:42,105 --> 00:12:44,910
The blankets still here?

193
00:12:44,944 --> 00:12:46,880
Yup.

194
00:12:58,672 --> 00:13:01,510
What is this?

195
00:13:01,544 --> 00:13:02,947
It's Arabic.

196
00:13:02,981 --> 00:13:04,817
I flunked Arabic.

197
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:07,088
I got an A.

198
00:13:07,122 --> 00:13:09,961
Well, partly because I paid
for the exam answers

199
00:13:09,962 --> 00:13:13,100
in nipple clamps.

200
00:13:13,134 --> 00:13:15,973
Bag Of Dicks is sounding
awful good.

201
00:13:15,974 --> 00:13:18,111
Ooh, copy that.

202
00:13:20,683 --> 00:13:23,188
Whoa.

203
00:13:23,222 --> 00:13:25,559
She means "Hi."

204
00:13:25,593 --> 00:13:27,363
Are you guys trying
to translate Arabic

205
00:13:27,364 --> 00:13:28,699
because I aced it here?

206
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,235
I mean, it was a couple
years ago, but-

207
00:13:30,236 --> 00:13:31,805
Yeah, mm-hmm.

208
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,910
Cry for help.

209
00:13:33,944 --> 00:13:35,480
Answered.

210
00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:42,827
- Mike.
- Eliot.

211
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,239
Margo.

212
00:14:15,028 --> 00:14:16,830
Yes, yes.

213
00:14:16,865 --> 00:14:21,106
By all means,
congratulate yourselves.

214
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:25,949
You are both such winners.

215
00:14:58,783 --> 00:15:02,523
Possibly your first
intelligent communiqué.

216
00:15:02,524 --> 00:15:06,865
You should have been
rendered mute long ago.

217
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:09,070
Now you're probably wondering,

218
00:15:09,071 --> 00:15:11,308
"What next?"

219
00:15:14,115 --> 00:15:18,105
Bujold's Nail Extraction,
that's what.

220
00:15:38,364 --> 00:15:41,002
- You need help.
- "Help."

221
00:15:41,003 --> 00:15:42,806
You can't keep going like this.

222
00:15:42,807 --> 00:15:44,676
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

223
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:46,112
Jules.

224
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:47,816
Please.

225
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:48,851
This is just like Daddy.

226
00:15:48,852 --> 00:15:50,772
Daddy was a drunk.

227
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:52,358
He was crazy.
I'm not-

228
00:15:52,359 --> 00:15:54,629
James told us he's worried.

229
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,133
James?

230
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:58,170
Well, let me bring you
up to speed.

231
00:15:58,171 --> 00:16:01,543
James doesn't remember me...
at all.

232
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,480
He called last month.

233
00:16:03,481 --> 00:16:06,019
Said the reason you dropped out
was your recovery.

234
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,359
Well, so much
for "anonymous," right?

235
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,401
He cares, Julia.
So do I.

236
00:16:13,436 --> 00:16:15,071
It's why I left eight messages.

237
00:16:15,072 --> 00:16:19,002
I mean if I had known
that you were-

238
00:16:19,781 --> 00:16:22,119
Mom knows you got arrested.

239
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,622
She has to keep this
out of the papers.

240
00:16:23,623 --> 00:16:25,192
She just got elected
to the board of the Met

241
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:27,796
and is trying to close
on a new co-op.

242
00:16:27,797 --> 00:16:29,935
Of course she is.

243
00:16:29,969 --> 00:16:31,404
She said you're gonna
get help, or-

244
00:16:31,405 --> 00:16:32,908
Or what?

245
00:16:32,942 --> 00:16:35,980
You tell her that I'm not Daddy.
I'm not crazy.

246
00:16:35,981 --> 00:16:41,425
She's not sticking me someplace
to rot where she stuck him.

247
00:16:41,426 --> 00:16:45,065
She's not gonna let go of this.

248
00:16:45,099 --> 00:16:48,072
Well,
I'm sorry, what can she do?

249
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:49,808
You know, I'm an adult.

250
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:52,113
Who disappeared,

251
00:16:52,148 --> 00:16:55,019
confessed to being on drugs,
got arrested.

252
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,588
You think she doesn't
go to the opera

253
00:16:56,589 --> 00:16:58,592
with ten judges who would
happily commit you?

254
00:16:58,593 --> 00:17:02,267
She's Mom.

255
00:17:02,301 --> 00:17:04,071
Fucking bitch.

256
00:17:04,105 --> 00:17:07,315
Right down to her lizard pumps.

257
00:17:08,648 --> 00:17:10,584
But I'm not.

258
00:17:13,056 --> 00:17:15,594
I love you

259
00:17:15,628 --> 00:17:17,966
and I can keep her away

260
00:17:17,967 --> 00:17:19,702
and get you help.

261
00:17:19,703 --> 00:17:23,343
Just please let me.

262
00:17:23,378 --> 00:17:25,614
I called a place.

263
00:17:25,649 --> 00:17:28,439
They can take you tomorrow.

264
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:31,861
A "place"?

265
00:17:33,573 --> 00:17:38,509
You remain because you're best.

266
00:17:39,045 --> 00:17:41,191
***

267
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,391
You may now speak.

268
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,738
You remain silent?

269
00:17:50,772 --> 00:17:53,476
Perhaps you're teachable
after all.

270
00:17:53,477 --> 00:17:54,913
Good.

271
00:17:54,947 --> 00:17:58,086
As that which you
will now learn,

272
00:17:58,087 --> 00:18:02,762
few know
and even fewer understand.

273
00:18:03,932 --> 00:18:06,937
Mind control.

274
00:18:06,971 --> 00:18:09,342
And these...

275
00:18:11,481 --> 00:18:13,941
Are your first subjects.

276
00:18:15,188 --> 00:18:17,392
Uh...

277
00:18:17,426 --> 00:18:19,362
isn't that kind of unethical?

278
00:18:19,363 --> 00:18:22,034
I mean, even if they're bugs,
they're alive.

279
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:23,270
They have free will.

280
00:18:23,271 --> 00:18:25,007
We've been taught not to

281
00:18:25,008 --> 00:18:28,681
try to control living things.

282
00:18:28,716 --> 00:18:30,685
How was your lunch today?

283
00:18:30,686 --> 00:18:32,823
Excellent boeuf bourguignon, no?

284
00:18:32,824 --> 00:18:34,660
And how much free will

285
00:18:34,661 --> 00:18:37,599
was exerted by the cow?

286
00:18:39,137 --> 00:18:43,244
Mind control
is in everything, everywhere.

287
00:18:43,245 --> 00:18:45,549
We make only one choice:

288
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:48,054
are you the controller

289
00:18:48,088 --> 00:18:49,858
or controlled?

290
00:18:58,543 --> 00:19:03,219
You do not like the moth I see.

291
00:19:03,253 --> 00:19:04,521
Good.

292
00:19:04,555 --> 00:19:07,494
That which you hate-

293
00:19:07,528 --> 00:19:09,364
or fear,

294
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:14,007
will motivate you to enslave it.

295
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,579
Ah.

296
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:18,483
My favorite.

297
00:19:33,514 --> 00:19:35,617
You're psychic?

298
00:19:38,024 --> 00:19:41,664
- You're also Traveler?
- Yeah.

299
00:19:41,698 --> 00:19:45,438
What idiot marked you there?
Don't tell me.

300
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:48,311
- A well-meaning educator.
- It's saving my life.

301
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,546
It's chaining you to a rock.

302
00:19:49,547 --> 00:19:51,784
You are free.

303
00:19:51,818 --> 00:19:55,158
More free than almost anyone
in this universe

304
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:57,079
or any other.
Ah.

305
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:02,539
Where you think
you're sticking that?

306
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,713
They told you not to travel, eh?

307
00:20:05,714 --> 00:20:08,017
Too unpredictable,
too hard to control-

308
00:20:08,018 --> 00:20:10,990
Yeah, because it is.
I got zero control.

309
00:20:10,991 --> 00:20:12,860
I don't-I don't even have
a decent sense of direction.

310
00:20:12,861 --> 00:20:15,232
Is like telling eagle

311
00:20:15,266 --> 00:20:19,207
to fear heights.

312
00:20:19,241 --> 00:20:22,346
I teach you to soar.

313
00:20:24,018 --> 00:20:25,686
Yes?

314
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:41,252
So-so, wait.

315
00:20:41,286 --> 00:20:44,391
So, um-
so, so you know Rick?

316
00:20:44,392 --> 00:20:47,662
Oh, my God, Rick is-
is great.

317
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:53,665
This magic gin better make us
see unicorns that fart rainbows.

318
00:20:53,678 --> 00:20:57,618
Guys, we have a lot
of work to do here.

319
00:20:57,619 --> 00:21:00,825
Just bang.

320
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,227
Now!

321
00:21:19,363 --> 00:21:21,066
Okay, that was weird.

322
00:21:21,067 --> 00:21:22,535
Describe.

323
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:25,341
Yeah, I was in
my hometown in-in Florida.

324
00:21:25,342 --> 00:21:28,681
Weird. Dull.
Again.

325
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,902
Yes?

326
00:21:38,937 --> 00:21:40,138
Uh, desert.

327
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,707
- Earth?
- Yeah.

328
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,779
Maybe Afghanistan.
There were guys with guns.

329
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:46,217
Um, I think I saw a drone.

330
00:21:46,218 --> 00:21:49,023
Again.

331
00:21:54,368 --> 00:21:55,770
Fucking volcano!

332
00:21:55,771 --> 00:21:57,005
Jesus.

333
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:00,190
Which you survived.
Gold star.

334
00:22:04,488 --> 00:22:07,560
Well, you seem
to be the only ones

335
00:22:07,561 --> 00:22:09,932
who can't complete the task.

336
00:22:09,933 --> 00:22:12,638
In one case, surprising.

337
00:22:12,672 --> 00:22:13,932
The other...

338
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,829
We try something new.

339
00:22:24,863 --> 00:22:28,803
The rings are wired to zap.

340
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:33,813
Bug flies into ring.

341
00:22:33,849 --> 00:22:35,617
Ah, Jesus.

342
00:22:35,652 --> 00:22:37,488
Your fate is now tied

343
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:40,460
to the lowest form
of sentient life.

344
00:22:40,461 --> 00:22:43,467
I deem that...

345
00:22:43,502 --> 00:22:45,638
appropriate.

346
00:22:47,743 --> 00:22:50,113
Let's just get one.

347
00:22:50,148 --> 00:22:51,850
Okay.

348
00:22:51,885 --> 00:22:53,120
Upper left.

349
00:22:53,155 --> 00:22:56,026
Okay.

350
00:23:03,843 --> 00:23:04,978
Okay.

351
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:11,558
- It's working.
- Yeah.

352
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:13,328
Okay.

353
00:23:17,204 --> 00:23:18,939
Yes! Yes!

354
00:23:18,973 --> 00:23:21,144
Whoa, I am so-
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

355
00:23:21,145 --> 00:23:22,546
- It's okay.
- Sorry.

356
00:23:22,547 --> 00:23:24,350
It's okay.

357
00:23:24,385 --> 00:23:26,454
Whoa-ow.

358
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:29,052
Quentin!

359
00:23:36,809 --> 00:23:39,113
I-I-
I don't, um-

360
00:23:39,147 --> 00:23:41,034
I'm-I'm-
I'm sorry, really sorry-

361
00:23:41,035 --> 00:23:44,141
Jesus.

362
00:23:44,175 --> 00:23:45,675
Is that vodka?

363
00:23:45,678 --> 00:23:47,347
You want me to flunk him

364
00:23:47,348 --> 00:23:50,888
so you can pass this test
with flying colors alone?

365
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:52,791
No, sir.

366
00:23:54,897 --> 00:23:58,202
I tried.

367
00:24:00,074 --> 00:24:02,512
Again.

368
00:24:02,546 --> 00:24:05,250
No.

369
00:24:06,955 --> 00:24:08,156
Again.

370
00:24:11,364 --> 00:24:13,334
Ha, yes! Yeah!

371
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:16,273
Oh, my God.

372
00:24:20,048 --> 00:24:21,784
Where's the joy?

373
00:24:21,785 --> 00:24:23,554
The fun?

374
00:24:23,588 --> 00:24:27,896
Why are you both determined
to be so fucking bland?

375
00:24:27,897 --> 00:24:30,902
Wait, are you flunking us?

376
00:24:30,937 --> 00:24:33,375
Sadly, I cannot.

377
00:24:36,949 --> 00:24:38,985
Rest. Eat.

378
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,170
Meet me in the entry at 5:00.

379
00:24:44,932 --> 00:24:46,902
I almost, uh-

380
00:24:46,936 --> 00:24:49,106
I almost died today

381
00:24:49,141 --> 00:24:51,310
and I-I realized
I didn't want to die

382
00:24:51,311 --> 00:24:54,451
without knowing, so-

383
00:24:54,485 --> 00:24:55,687
if you-

384
00:24:55,721 --> 00:24:57,657
if you feel like telling me,

385
00:24:57,658 --> 00:24:59,093
I'm here.

386
00:24:59,127 --> 00:25:02,817
I don't have
to tell you anything.

387
00:25:03,236 --> 00:25:06,075
I just have to drop my wards...

388
00:25:06,076 --> 00:25:08,112
let you in.

389
00:25:12,021 --> 00:25:16,462
You can see everything.

390
00:25:16,496 --> 00:25:18,265
Come on in.

391
00:25:34,968 --> 00:25:37,104
Your mom...

392
00:25:41,413 --> 00:25:43,283
Jesus, she...

393
00:25:46,992 --> 00:25:49,763
And she's the only person
you love in the world.

394
00:25:49,764 --> 00:25:51,634
<i>♪ ♪</i>

395
00:25:51,668 --> 00:25:53,771
Not anymore.

396
00:26:11,374 --> 00:26:13,474
<i>- Oh, my God.
- Oh!</i>

397
00:26:18,723 --> 00:26:21,528
I'm thinking.

398
00:26:21,562 --> 00:26:24,934
You're too pretty.

399
00:26:26,405 --> 00:26:29,143
- Okay, listen, listen.
- What?

400
00:26:29,144 --> 00:26:31,348
What if this-Marina?

401
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:33,585
Okay, what if she got this-

what if she got
some serious shit?

one-of-a-kind magic.

404
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:44,541
Maybe it'd buy you out.
For good.

405
00:26:44,576 --> 00:26:47,180
It'd have to be pretty amazing.

408

Mayakovsky's office.

409

I'd just like to point out
that for the record,

410
00:27:04,817 --> 00:27:07,422
you guys basically did nothing
except each other.

Don't.
I'm just using you for effect.

You're right, Margo.
I'm sorry.

we get a chance

415

to get to know each other.

416
00:27:20,682 --> 00:27:23,287
We'll give it a whirl
after Ibiza...

417
00:27:23,288 --> 00:27:26,761
- maybe.
- Enough, ladies.

418
00:27:26,795 --> 00:27:30,545
- Shall we magic some gin?
- Please.

419
00:27:43,129 --> 00:27:46,969
Well, that was underwhelming.

- Cool.

428
00:28:19,202 --> 00:28:21,171
Shut up, Todd.

429
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,551
Wait, this could be great.

430

grants wishes for real,

This was your idea.

He was talking to you.

I don't even know what he said.

450
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,863
It was Arabic.

451
00:31:05,898 --> 00:31:08,202
He said, "Yes, Mistress,
I understand,"

452
00:31:08,203 --> 00:31:09,571
and then something I didn't get,

453
00:31:09,572 --> 00:31:12,210
and then, "I will do
exactly that to him."

454
00:31:12,211 --> 00:31:14,381
To him.
To Mike.

00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:11,636
with your perfect family

586
00:40:11,637 --> 00:40:15,444
and gloat over my frozen corpse.

587
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:19,952
You're welcome.

588
00:40:19,987 --> 00:40:21,322
Quentin...

589
00:40:21,357 --> 00:40:23,426
why?

590
00:40:23,461 --> 00:40:25,330
Why the fox?

591
00:40:25,365 --> 00:40:29,105
Why not mollusk or firefly?
Why?

592
00:40:29,139 --> 00:40:31,342
The fox knows

593
00:40:31,377 --> 00:40:34,716
and I knew...

594
00:40:34,751 --> 00:40:37,321
everything I needed
to survive was me

595
00:40:37,322 --> 00:40:38,991
and it's not just to survive,

596
00:40:38,992 --> 00:40:42,465
but to be happy.

597
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,736
I was...

598
00:40:44,771 --> 00:40:46,340
happy.

599
00:40:46,374 --> 00:40:49,212
The fox is in you now-

600
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:52,920
both of you.

601
00:40:52,955 --> 00:40:55,058
Feed it.

602
00:40:59,902 --> 00:41:03,112
You really are a great teacher.

603
00:41:04,445 --> 00:41:06,414
I know.

# The Strangled Heart

1
00:00:00,211 --> 00:00:01,625
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:01,745 --> 00:00:04,094
Let's just net this
all in the bud.

3
00:00:04,214 --> 00:00:05,415
You were the paramedic.

4
00:00:05,516 --> 00:00:07,250
Call me Eliza.
I was there that day

5
00:00:07,351 --> 00:00:09,419
to make sure that you got here.

6
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,789
- We flew here to Antarctica?
- So what is this then?

7
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:14,557
We're here to study
with Mayakovsky.

8
00:00:14,658 --> 00:00:18,161
Remove your clothes.
Do it!

9
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:22,799
A few minutes,
we're flying again.

10
00:00:25,035 --> 00:00:28,304
They know everything
at Brakebills, what you've done.

11
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:29,839
You cannot go back.

12
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,908
- Hey, where's Kady?
- Who gives a shit?

13
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,276
Run.

14
00:00:37,147 --> 00:00:38,815
You can't keep going like this.

15
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:41,117
I called a place.
They can take you tomorrow.

16
00:00:41,218 --> 00:00:42,852
A "place"?

17
00:00:42,953 --> 00:00:44,854
- Mike.
- Eliot.

18
00:00:44,955 --> 00:00:46,756
What's so special about him?

19
00:01:22,793 --> 00:01:24,660
It's a little something
I invented.

20
00:01:24,762 --> 00:01:26,229
Oh.

21
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:28,297
I'd take a beer
if you've got one.

22
00:01:28,398 --> 00:01:30,566
A beer?

23
00:01:30,667 --> 00:01:33,102
You are lucky you're pretty.

24
00:01:33,203 --> 00:01:34,937
Eliot.

25
00:01:35,038 --> 00:01:37,273
You're back.

26
00:01:37,374 --> 00:01:39,242
Hooray!

27
00:01:39,343 --> 00:01:40,810
Oh, thank God.

28
00:01:40,911 --> 00:01:42,671
How do you always have drinks
waiting for us?

29
00:01:42,713 --> 00:01:48,551
Oh, just a good host, I guess.

30
00:01:48,652 --> 00:01:51,387
Guys, this is my friend Mike.

31
00:01:51,488 --> 00:01:53,890
He graduated a few years ago
and lives in New York,

32
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:55,825
and Margo tried to kill him
with a Djinn,

33
00:01:55,926 --> 00:01:57,126
but we fixed it.

34
00:01:57,227 --> 00:01:58,928
This is Alice, that's Quentin.

35
00:01:59,029 --> 00:02:00,663
- They are nerds.
- I could kind of tell.

36
00:02:00,764 --> 00:02:03,466
How was Brakebills South?
Did anyone freeze to death?

37
00:02:03,567 --> 00:02:05,835
Oh, I mean, it was--

38
00:02:05,936 --> 00:02:08,771
it was eventful.
I--

39
00:02:08,872 --> 00:02:12,141
Why is your face
making that face?

40
00:02:12,242 --> 00:02:15,311
Oh, my God.

41
00:02:15,412 --> 00:02:17,513
- They totally had sex.
- Yeah.

42
00:02:17,614 --> 00:02:18,815
- No, nothing happened.
- I mean, it just happened.

43
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:20,349
Let me guess.

44
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,090
You got drunk
on Mayakovsky's lichen vodka

45
00:02:22,152 --> 00:02:23,452
and you seduced him.

46
00:02:23,554 --> 00:02:25,221
Maybe I seduced her.

47
00:02:25,322 --> 00:02:27,390
Please. And sweetie,

48
00:02:27,491 --> 00:02:30,526
getting drunk and porking
a dungeon master

49
00:02:30,627 --> 00:02:31,727
is nothing to be a ashamed of.

50
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:32,995
Ah, porking?

51
00:02:33,096 --> 00:02:34,397
I was looking at the pork butt.

52
00:02:34,498 --> 00:02:36,532
I'm going to go take a nap

53
00:02:36,633 --> 00:02:38,768
and pretend that this entire
conversation never happened.

54
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:40,269
Okay.

55
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,804
Ah, ah, I--

56
00:02:45,475 --> 00:02:47,710
- Nice meeting you.
- Mm-hmm.

57
00:02:47,811 --> 00:02:49,512
Eyes on the pork butt, mister.

58
00:02:49,613 --> 00:02:50,613
- He's pretty.
- I know.

59
00:02:50,714 --> 00:02:51,914
But I called dibs on him.

60
00:02:56,553 --> 00:02:59,288
Hey, ignore Eliot.
He's--

61
00:02:59,389 --> 00:03:03,025
You know, just being Eliot.

62
00:03:05,929 --> 00:03:07,430
Don't.

63
00:03:07,531 --> 00:03:11,067
I thought "nap" was code.

64
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:17,173
Can we just talk about this
seriously for a second?

65
00:03:17,274 --> 00:03:22,411
What we did was stress and
circumstances, and pheromones.

66
00:03:22,512 --> 00:03:24,247
The first time,
but not the next four.

67
00:03:24,348 --> 00:03:27,683
- You were...counting?
- Of course I was counting.

68
00:03:27,784 --> 00:03:29,252
Maybe Eliot's right.

69
00:03:29,353 --> 00:03:31,187
We might as well have been
drunk or high, or--

70
00:03:31,288 --> 00:03:32,989
I'm not under the influence
right now.

71
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,858
Yes, we are, Q.

72
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:39,195
I can still smell you,
but like, fox you,

73
00:03:39,296 --> 00:03:41,163
and I'm pretty sure you can
still smell me.

74
00:03:41,265 --> 00:03:43,165
That could have
a lot to do with the fact

75
00:03:43,267 --> 00:03:44,095
that we haven't bathed in weeks.

76
00:03:44,215 --> 00:03:45,843
Are you in love with me?

77
00:03:48,105 --> 00:03:49,427
I, uh--I don't know.

78
00:03:49,547 --> 00:03:51,207
Even if you fell down
on your knees

79
00:03:51,308 --> 00:03:53,576
and proclaimed your, you know.

80
00:03:53,677 --> 00:03:56,479
I know it wasn't really you.

81
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:02,051
I think that we need to...
spend some time apart,

82
00:04:02,152 --> 00:04:04,053
so we can know what's real
and what's fox.

83
00:04:12,462 --> 00:04:14,063
<i>When they were lost,</i>

84
00:04:14,164 --> 00:04:16,465
ancient sailors used the stars
to find their way,

85
00:04:16,566 --> 00:04:18,234
but, for you,
they're an obstacle

86
00:04:18,335 --> 00:04:20,369
because they change
Circumstances

87
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,305
so they can really bone
your casting.

88
00:04:22,406 --> 00:04:25,374
When you're factoring
the position of the Pleiades--

89
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:26,909
You want to keep in mind--

90
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,278
Whoa!

91
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:31,647
Whoa.

92
00:04:31,748 --> 00:04:34,283
Sorry, I just,
uh, I'll leave you--

93
00:04:34,384 --> 00:04:37,653
in your little sewing circle.

94
00:04:37,754 --> 00:04:39,322
There's a syllabus, Penny,

95
00:04:39,423 --> 00:04:40,823
and you're supposed
to be studying--

96
00:04:40,924 --> 00:04:42,391
Haven't you heard--
haven't you--

97
00:04:42,492 --> 00:04:43,893
You're supposed to be studying
Astral Projection.

98
00:04:43,994 --> 00:04:44,994
Now, here is what I know.

99
00:04:45,062 --> 00:04:46,595
I fell like less of a pussy

100
00:04:46,697 --> 00:04:48,698
if I don't cower in fear
of my own ability.

101
00:04:48,799 --> 00:04:50,499
I mean, if I supposed to ever
be able to travel,

102
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,869
like really Travel
between worlds, I need--

103
00:04:53,971 --> 00:04:55,251
I need to be able to master this

104
00:04:55,305 --> 00:04:57,540
Earth-bound small potato
shit first.

105
00:04:57,641 --> 00:04:59,709
Is something else going on?

106
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:03,980
I know that you were close
with Kady.

107
00:05:04,081 --> 00:05:05,681
Not as close as you'd think.

108
00:05:10,754 --> 00:05:15,157
You know I-I have a great idea.

109
00:05:15,258 --> 00:05:17,193
I mean, you're so worried
about me,

110
00:05:17,294 --> 00:05:20,563
why don't you come Travel
with me?

111
00:05:20,664 --> 00:05:23,366
You teach me...

112
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:26,736
and I know there's a few things
I can teach you, too.

113
00:05:30,107 --> 00:05:34,777
I don't think
that would be appropriate.

114
00:05:34,878 --> 00:05:37,780
Oh, I totally agree.

115
00:05:37,881 --> 00:05:38,981
When do we leave?

116
00:05:41,318 --> 00:05:44,854
You're going to be late
for your next class.

117
00:05:51,161 --> 00:05:52,862
<i>Your first semester
with Brakebills</i>

118
00:05:52,963 --> 00:05:56,265
was dedicated to learning
the fundamentals of magic.

119
00:05:56,366 --> 00:05:58,734
We gave you the tools.

120
00:05:58,835 --> 00:06:01,804
Now, it is time for you
to use them.

121
00:06:01,905 --> 00:06:03,305
Look inside your bags.

122
00:06:03,407 --> 00:06:05,341
Starting today,

123
00:06:05,442 --> 00:06:07,309
your course load will double.

124
00:06:07,411 --> 00:06:10,413
Alchemy, astronomy, botany,

125
00:06:10,514 --> 00:06:11,680
just to name a few.

126
00:06:11,782 --> 00:06:14,784
Study groups are mandatory.

127
00:06:20,557 --> 00:06:22,525
Gretchen.

128
00:06:22,626 --> 00:06:26,362
Hey, uh, so I heard
that you sleep

129
00:06:26,463 --> 00:06:29,999
with Mister Spock body pillow.

130
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,367
No judgment. I just, um,

131
00:06:31,468 --> 00:06:33,869
I myself I have
a full collection

132
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:38,174
of Leonard Nimoy's spoken word
albums on vinyl.

133
00:06:38,275 --> 00:06:39,542
You interested?

134
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:43,746
Quentin, what are you--

135
00:06:43,847 --> 00:06:46,816
Gretchen, well,
basically begged me

136
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:50,820
to switch groups with her
and, uh, sorry.

137
00:06:50,921 --> 00:06:52,354
I wore extra deodorant, though.

138
00:06:52,456 --> 00:06:56,559
Yeah.
It's strong.

139
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,861
So, are we the whole
study group?

140
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:06,068
Hell is real...

141
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:09,038
and it smells like
Axe Body Spray.

Leave before I start screaming.

150
00:09:07,802 --> 00:09:11,372
Easy.
I just came here to talk.

151
00:09:11,473 --> 00:09:15,042
I'd say let's grab a drink
and hash shit out, but...

152
00:09:15,143 --> 00:09:16,744
I feel like
that's a no-no here.

153
00:09:16,845 --> 00:09:19,046
Why don't you talk about
what you did to Hannah.

154
00:09:19,147 --> 00:09:21,415
I was protecting myself
from a thief

155
00:09:21,516 --> 00:09:23,350
and I wish I hadn't been put
in that position.

156

Is this an amends letter?

157
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,559
Yes. Some of us are capable
of making them.

158
00:09:32,661 --> 00:09:34,461
Okay.

159
00:09:35,597 --> 00:09:37,197
Try this.

160
00:09:39,034 --> 00:09:41,468
I'm sorry, Julia.

161
00:09:43,938 --> 00:09:46,507
I don't let in a lot of people.

162
00:09:46,608 --> 00:09:48,876
And the ones I do...

163
00:09:48,977 --> 00:09:53,614
it's got to be some kind of
kindred spirit thing happening.

164
00:09:53,715 --> 00:09:57,718
I actually like you.

165
00:09:57,819 --> 00:09:59,553
And this?

166
00:09:59,654 --> 00:10:03,157
This is not what I wanted.

167
00:10:03,258 --> 00:10:04,858
You mean what you wrote?

168
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,395
You're giving it up?

169
00:10:09,931 --> 00:10:13,634
Well, let's short circuit
this whole thing.

170
00:10:13,735 --> 00:10:15,169
You stay out of my ass

171
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:18,105
and there is no blood feud
necessary on my end.

172
00:10:20,775 --> 00:10:23,010
But come after me,

173
00:10:23,111 --> 00:10:27,114
and I will kill you and everyone
that you care about.

174
00:10:27,215 --> 00:10:30,584
Well, the ones that are left,
anyway.

175
00:10:34,856 --> 00:10:35,856
Such a bitch.

176
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,291
And you're weak.

177
00:10:37,392 --> 00:10:39,626
Why apologize to him?

178
00:10:39,728 --> 00:10:43,530
He's the one who should be
in here, not you.

179
00:10:45,066 --> 00:10:47,267
Take your time, Professor.

180
00:10:58,046 --> 00:10:59,646
You're good to go.

181
00:10:59,748 --> 00:11:01,749
Okay, Henry.

182
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:02,950
Go ahead and try something.

183
00:11:12,127 --> 00:11:15,195
Take it slow.

184
00:11:15,296 --> 00:11:17,331
Okay.

185
00:11:17,432 --> 00:11:19,466
It might take a few tries,
Henry.

186
00:11:19,567 --> 00:11:22,302
There are physical therapy
exercises --

187
00:11:22,403 --> 00:11:25,205
When I was four years old,

188
00:11:25,306 --> 00:11:29,543
with no instruction
or help from anyone,

189
00:11:29,644 --> 00:11:32,813
I taught myself magic.

190
00:11:32,914 --> 00:11:35,482
I will do so again.

191
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,219
This is a disaster!

192
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:43,023
- What's wrong?
- I have nothing to wear.

193
00:11:43,124 --> 00:11:46,560
You think that might be,
I don't know, hyperbole?

194
00:11:46,661 --> 00:11:50,330
I am not emotionally prepared
for Mike

195
00:11:50,431 --> 00:11:52,332
to see me repeat outfits.

196
00:11:52,433 --> 00:11:54,001
I think this might be
a Margo problem.

197
00:11:54,102 --> 00:11:56,270
Obviously, Quentin,
but she shacked up

198
00:11:56,371 --> 00:11:58,205
with some<i> artiste</i>
at Encanto Octulo,

199
00:11:58,306 --> 00:12:02,109
and, so, I'm stuck with you.

200
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:04,278
Honestly, all vests
look the same to me.

201
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:07,815
I made a horrible mistake
asking you to help.

202
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,149
Please, leave.

203
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,553
I was here first.

204
00:12:12,654 --> 00:12:15,889
I've never really seen you
care about something.

205
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,158
Things aren't usually
worth caring about.

206
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:22,062
With some limited,
but very important exceptions.

207
00:12:22,163 --> 00:12:24,298
Very limited.

208
00:12:26,534 --> 00:12:28,468
But seriously, leave.

209
00:12:31,873 --> 00:12:35,642
And for those who don't know
me way too well already,

210
00:12:35,743 --> 00:12:37,344
I'm Richard,
I'm the chaplain here

211
00:12:37,445 --> 00:12:41,348
and I will try to make my thing
today brief.

212
00:12:41,449 --> 00:12:43,851
No matter why you started using,

213
00:12:43,952 --> 00:12:47,120
if you try hard enough,
you can get clean.

214
00:12:47,222 --> 00:12:50,290
You can change everything
about your circumstances,

215
00:12:50,391 --> 00:12:54,194
but the one thing that won't
have changed is you.

216
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:59,733
Same head, same heart,
same mistakes.

217
00:12:59,834 --> 00:13:01,134
Now, we don't like to hear it,

218
00:13:01,236 --> 00:13:04,504
but we need something
or someone to lean on

219
00:13:04,606 --> 00:13:06,640
that is bigger than ourselves.

220
00:13:06,741 --> 00:13:08,175
Just say it.

221
00:13:08,276 --> 00:13:09,676
God.

222
00:13:09,777 --> 00:13:12,112
Well, that's one way
to putting it.

223
00:13:12,213 --> 00:13:14,214
You know, there is a word

224
00:13:14,315 --> 00:13:17,517
when you lean on something,
a crutch.

225
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,355
Replacing drugs or booze
or porn,

226
00:13:21,456 --> 00:13:22,856
or whatever with
a "Higher Power",

227
00:13:22,957 --> 00:13:24,758
it's just swapping one crutch
for another.

228
00:13:24,859 --> 00:13:27,527
That is a bummer way
of looking at things.

229
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:29,897
Why don't you just tell
these people the truth?

230
00:13:29,998 --> 00:13:33,567
Maybe we just need to accept
the world for what actually is.

231
00:13:33,668 --> 00:13:38,038
Oh, what about making
the world what we want it to be?

232
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:40,240
You know, with a little effort,
a little faith.

233
00:13:40,341 --> 00:13:44,144
Give a man hope and a nickel,
you got a nickel.

234
00:13:44,245 --> 00:13:47,180
- Who said that?
- Some dick.

235
00:13:47,282 --> 00:13:49,850
Wow!

236
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,852
So, what do you believe in?

237
00:13:51,953 --> 00:13:54,154
It doesn't have to be God
or whatever,

238
00:13:54,255 --> 00:13:56,890
but something bigger than you.

239
00:14:03,031 --> 00:14:04,598
I don't understand.

240
00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:06,433
The idea is you look
at the list of ingredients

241
00:14:06,534 --> 00:14:08,174
and try to figure out
what the spell does.

242
00:14:08,269 --> 00:14:10,804
- Yeah.
- Maybe, we should move on,

243
00:14:10,905 --> 00:14:12,873
if we wait for the simpleton,
we'll be here all night.

244
00:14:12,974 --> 00:14:16,576
Okay, if you understand,
then explain it.

245
00:14:16,678 --> 00:14:18,845
It's a healing spell.
I've seen that

246
00:14:18,947 --> 00:14:20,347
welwitsch-whatever
in the infirmary.

247
00:14:20,448 --> 00:14:21,815
Actually, trick question.

248
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:24,418
It's a<i> welwitschia mirabilis,</i>

249
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:26,653
the leaves are used for both,
healing spells

250
00:14:26,754 --> 00:14:28,455
and for doing exotic curses.

251
00:14:29,757 --> 00:14:31,191
I thought it was a fern.

252
00:14:31,292 --> 00:14:32,652
Which is why I brought
flash cards.

253
00:14:32,694 --> 00:14:33,860
Of course you did.

254
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,597
Thank you, Alice.

255
00:14:37,699 --> 00:14:40,334
Could you not--
Could you-- for one minute,

256
00:14:40,435 --> 00:14:41,668
could you not give her
googly eye?

257
00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:42,836
Oh, God.

258
00:14:42,937 --> 00:14:44,438
I don't know what you're,

259
00:14:44,539 --> 00:14:47,007
uh, implying or, um, inferring.

260
00:14:47,108 --> 00:14:49,309
Brakebills South didn't have
a lot of things.

261
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:53,046
Livable weather, edible food,
cable TV,

262
00:14:53,147 --> 00:14:54,982
but you know what it did have?

263
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:57,551
Windows.

264
00:14:57,652 --> 00:14:59,987
So if you don't know
and saw your little--

265
00:15:00,088 --> 00:15:02,889
little extracurricular
activities,

266
00:15:02,991 --> 00:15:05,225
you'd be very mistaken foxes.

267
00:15:05,326 --> 00:15:06,827
I was above average for a fox.

268
00:15:06,928 --> 00:15:10,330
Okay, I've studied enough
for one day.

269
00:15:10,431 --> 00:15:12,265
Thank you for that.

270
00:15:12,367 --> 00:15:15,635
It ain't my fault,
or my problem.

271
00:15:15,737 --> 00:15:17,170
For the record, you do see
that you're doing wrong, though?

272
00:15:17,271 --> 00:15:20,607
I don't need your help.

273
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,409
But if I hypothetically did--

274
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:25,512
Man, you act like a stalker

275
00:15:25,613 --> 00:15:29,483
and then go out of your way
to deny that you're interested.

276
00:15:29,584 --> 00:15:31,151
Either, grow a pair

277
00:15:31,252 --> 00:15:33,820
or she'll find someone
who already did.

278
00:15:34,922 --> 00:15:37,858
- Wow!
- Not done.

279
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,295
Only downside is,

280
00:15:42,397 --> 00:15:45,565
it burns off all the alcohol.

281
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:48,068
Looks amazing.

282
00:15:48,169 --> 00:15:50,570
Yeah, you don't have to kill
yourself for me.

283
00:15:50,671 --> 00:15:53,240
It was no trouble.

284
00:15:53,341 --> 00:15:58,111
I'm--I'm already deeply
impressed, you know?

285
00:15:58,212 --> 00:15:59,946
And, I mean, I feel like

286
00:16:00,048 --> 00:16:03,016
I should be doing stuff
like this for you, but...

287
00:16:03,117 --> 00:16:07,574
- I don't really know how.
- Don't be silly.

288
00:16:07,694 --> 00:16:11,425
I guess I'm just waiting
for the part in all of this

289
00:16:11,526 --> 00:16:13,527
where I start to bore you.

290
00:16:13,628 --> 00:16:14,415
You don't bore me.

291
00:16:14,535 --> 00:16:15,798
I don't think
that you could bore me.

292
00:16:15,918 --> 00:16:19,533
I don't know
about music and wine,

293
00:16:19,634 --> 00:16:23,070
and frankly any country
not named Texas.

294
00:16:23,171 --> 00:16:24,971
Texas is a state.

295
00:16:25,073 --> 00:16:26,758
Not when you're from Texas.

296
00:16:27,049 --> 00:16:29,175
Um...

297
00:16:30,378 --> 00:16:32,412
Come here.

298
00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:43,156
Where do you think I come from?

299
00:16:43,257 --> 00:16:45,024
I don't know.

300
00:16:45,314 --> 00:16:46,415
Someplace with money?

301
00:16:46,516 --> 00:16:48,183
Well, um, we did have money.

302
00:16:48,284 --> 00:16:51,219
Until grandmama gambled it
all away

303
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,523
and now, all we have is titles.

304
00:16:54,624 --> 00:16:57,726
Sorry.
Um, that was a joke.

305
00:17:00,663 --> 00:17:03,665
I was...

306
00:17:03,766 --> 00:17:06,601
born in Indiana...

307
00:17:06,703 --> 00:17:08,904
on a farm.

308
00:17:09,005 --> 00:17:13,008
My parents are farmers.

309
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:15,343
Indiana? I--

310
00:17:15,445 --> 00:17:16,611
I thought you--

311
00:17:16,713 --> 00:17:19,915
Of course you did.

312
00:17:20,016 --> 00:17:25,120
Becoming me was the greatest
creative project of my life.

313
00:17:25,221 --> 00:17:26,988
So...

314
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:29,825
FYI, no one else here knows,
except for Margo,

315
00:17:29,926 --> 00:17:33,962
and that's only because she was
my secret partner in the Trials.

316
00:17:34,063 --> 00:17:36,732
Everyone else, I...

317
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:38,533
kind of let them go on thinking

318
00:17:38,634 --> 00:17:42,170
I grew up summering
with Kennedys, etcetera.

319
00:17:47,777 --> 00:17:49,211
Thank you.

320
00:17:49,312 --> 00:17:51,313
For what?

321
00:17:51,414 --> 00:17:53,281
Just you.

322
00:17:56,586 --> 00:17:58,954
Um, well...

323
00:18:01,758 --> 00:18:03,658
Here I am.

324
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,227
Yeah.

325
00:18:05,328 --> 00:18:08,864
Here you are.

326
00:18:08,965 --> 00:18:10,832
- Hi.
- Hey.

327
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,497
I checked the position
of Cephus three times,

328
00:18:42,598 --> 00:18:45,033
I did the whole invocation,

329
00:18:45,134 --> 00:18:49,838
this stupid plant should be
seven feet tall by now.

330
00:18:49,939 --> 00:18:51,807
What?

331
00:18:54,744 --> 00:18:56,812
What happened to you and Kady?

332
00:18:56,913 --> 00:18:59,147
You guys were inseparable.

333
00:18:59,248 --> 00:19:01,016
She gets through the Trials,

334
00:19:01,117 --> 00:19:04,019
passes all of Mayakovsky's test
and then she's just--

335
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,055
She didn't give me an itinerary.

336
00:19:07,156 --> 00:19:08,824
Man, I don't get it.

337
00:19:08,925 --> 00:19:12,194
You act like you're
this panty-whisperer,

338
00:19:12,295 --> 00:19:14,735
and your girl disappears and you
don't even know where she is.

339
00:19:14,797 --> 00:19:16,064
You see her,

340
00:19:16,165 --> 00:19:19,901
tell her she owes me 20 bucks.

341
00:19:20,002 --> 00:19:22,037
Can I help you?

342
00:19:22,138 --> 00:19:24,339
- What?
- Not you.

343
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,942
Ah, hey, Mike.

344
00:19:27,043 --> 00:19:29,444
Sorry. I got--I got
a little turned around.

345
00:19:29,545 --> 00:19:32,380
Um, could you tell me which way
the cottage is?

346
00:19:32,481 --> 00:19:33,915
Yeah. It's like--

347
00:19:37,019 --> 00:19:38,854
Oh, shit.

348
00:19:55,938 --> 00:19:57,839
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

349
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,574
Whoa!

350
00:19:59,675 --> 00:20:03,041
Help!
Help! Somebody help!

351
00:20:04,574 --> 00:20:07,100
Get a transfusion ready, get
the Reidlinger Stones warmed up.

352
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,520
Can you mend the wound?

353
00:20:08,621 --> 00:20:09,721
It's deep,
but it's not impossible.

354
00:20:09,823 --> 00:20:11,023
The weapon.
We need the weapon.

355
00:20:11,057 --> 00:20:12,157
- Quentin.
- Mike. Mike has it.

356
00:20:12,258 --> 00:20:13,392
I need to see the knife to know.

357
00:20:13,493 --> 00:20:14,626
- Yes, yes, yes, I know.
- To know what?

358
00:20:14,727 --> 00:20:16,195
Find him. Now.

359
00:20:16,296 --> 00:20:20,732
Mike is, uh,
Eliot's boyfriend, I guess.

360
00:20:21,168 --> 00:20:23,736
He was trying to kill me
before Penny jumped in the way.

361
00:20:23,837 --> 00:20:25,905
Could have anything
to do with the Beast?

362
00:20:26,006 --> 00:20:27,039
Why would it?

363
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,340
Because it makes more sense

364
00:20:28,442 --> 00:20:30,242
than somebody new
try to kill me.

365
00:20:30,343 --> 00:20:32,578
Well, right now there are
far too many possibilities.

366
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:35,147
We will certainly ask
Mr. McCormick when we find him.

367
00:20:39,753 --> 00:20:42,388
Quentin.

368
00:20:42,489 --> 00:20:44,623
Is Penny okay?

369
00:20:44,724 --> 00:20:47,059
Uh, he's in surgery.
I don't know.

370
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,161
I just heard.
Everyone's really scared.

371
00:20:49,262 --> 00:20:51,022
I would've told you,
but Fogg wouldn't let us

372
00:20:51,064 --> 00:20:52,398
leave the building until...

373
00:20:52,499 --> 00:20:54,934
- Until they find Mike.
- They did find him.

374
00:20:55,035 --> 00:20:57,195
Professor Sunderland and March
found him trying to open

375
00:20:57,237 --> 00:20:59,104
a portal near
the Welters stadium.

376
00:21:02,008 --> 00:21:05,277
Where are they taking him?

377
00:21:05,378 --> 00:21:09,482
Have you ever been
in this room before?

378
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,650
It was designed at the turn
of the century

379
00:21:11,751 --> 00:21:16,455
for a sect of incredibly
delicate experiments.

380
00:21:16,556 --> 00:21:19,091
Mechanism within the walls,
prevent any spell casting,

381
00:21:19,192 --> 00:21:22,995
it is, in fact, a clean room.

382
00:21:23,096 --> 00:21:26,298
It was not intended
for this--this purpose,

383
00:21:26,399 --> 00:21:28,200
but it will do.

384
00:21:28,301 --> 00:21:30,636
Where is the weapon...

385
00:21:30,737 --> 00:21:32,638
- that you used?
- I don't know.

386
00:21:32,739 --> 00:21:36,041
Were you specifically
targeting Penny and Quentin?

387
00:21:36,142 --> 00:21:38,244
I was in Brooklyn.

388
00:21:38,345 --> 00:21:41,413
Then I was here.
I don't know!

389
00:21:41,515 --> 00:21:42,882
- Professor--
- Dean.

390
00:21:42,983 --> 00:21:45,818
Henry, look I--

391
00:21:48,054 --> 00:21:49,522
Okay.

392
00:21:49,623 --> 00:21:51,090
Okay look.

393
00:21:51,191 --> 00:21:53,359
Look, you know me, right?

394
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,561
I was your student
for three years,

395
00:21:55,662 --> 00:21:58,797
- you know that I couldn't.
- I know you did!

396
00:22:00,467 --> 00:22:03,135
No, you can't go in there.

397
00:22:03,236 --> 00:22:05,070
What did he say?

398
00:22:05,171 --> 00:22:07,139
Nothing useful.

399
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,760
You're just gonna leave him
in there?

400
00:22:08,808 --> 00:22:09,875
I'm not letting him go.

401
00:22:09,976 --> 00:22:11,477
No, I mean, that's inhumane.

402
00:22:11,578 --> 00:22:13,618
There is procedures
for dealing with magical crimes.

403
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,914
A circuit court system.

404
00:22:15,015 --> 00:22:16,549
They're sending
in a representative.

405
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,250
- What will they do with him?
- They have facilities.

406
00:22:18,351 --> 00:22:20,920
But the exact punishment,
it depends.

407
00:22:21,021 --> 00:22:23,055
- On what?
- On whether Penny lives.

408
00:22:23,156 --> 00:22:25,057
This reeks of mind control.

409
00:22:25,158 --> 00:22:26,958
Wait. There was something
wrong with his eyes.

410
00:22:26,993 --> 00:22:28,953
They weren't entirely human,
that--that could be--

411
00:22:29,029 --> 00:22:31,163
I looked in every scenario
there is to think of.

412
00:22:31,264 --> 00:22:33,432
Spell gone wrong, doppelganger,

413
00:22:33,533 --> 00:22:35,601
and yes, gentlemen,
even mind control.

414
00:22:35,702 --> 00:22:38,671
But there was always the chance
that he did this,

415
00:22:38,772 --> 00:22:40,839
intentionally.

416
00:22:44,844 --> 00:22:45,844
Good morning.

417
00:22:45,946 --> 00:22:47,179
Pain killers.

418
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,714
Would be nice.

419
00:22:48,815 --> 00:22:50,482
Your surgery
was very successful.

420
00:22:50,584 --> 00:22:52,384
Your wounds are closed.

421
00:22:52,485 --> 00:22:54,486
Just one or two weeks of--

422
00:22:54,588 --> 00:22:57,323
Hey! You're not ready
to walk around yet.

423
00:22:57,424 --> 00:22:59,058
I was stabbed, woman,

424
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:01,393
I'm gonna find
the motherfucker who--

425
00:23:01,494 --> 00:23:03,329
Get Professor Lipson down here!

426
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:12,171
What?

427
00:23:13,961 --> 00:23:15,990
It's spreading too quickly
to be an infection.

428
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,277
The wound is cursed.

429
00:23:17,378 --> 00:23:18,878
Whatever it is,
is growing under the skin.

430
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,620
He's lucky it's not near
any vital organs.

431
00:23:20,681 --> 00:23:22,949
- The necrotizing tissue--
- Necrotizing?

432
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:25,018
Cell death within the tissue.

433
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:26,479
If it touches
something important--

434
00:23:26,554 --> 00:23:28,088
How do you fix it?

435
00:23:28,189 --> 00:23:30,824
Without seeing the knife I...

436
00:23:30,925 --> 00:23:32,492
I have no idea.

437
00:23:32,593 --> 00:23:34,260
I hate magic.

438
00:23:34,362 --> 00:23:35,595
I mean, why us?

439
00:23:35,696 --> 00:23:37,497
You, I get.

440
00:23:37,598 --> 00:23:39,332
I think about stabbing you
all the time.

441
00:23:41,869 --> 00:23:44,137
That was a 100% not a joke.

442
00:23:44,238 --> 00:23:46,439
You realized that knife
was coming at me

443
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:49,242
before you jump in the way
of it, right?

444
00:23:49,343 --> 00:23:52,612
I owe you, like,
a Wookie Life Debt.

445
00:23:52,713 --> 00:23:54,247
Get a knife.
I'll stab you right now.

446
00:24:02,723 --> 00:24:03,890
I keep thinking--

447
00:24:03,991 --> 00:24:06,960
- The Beast.
- It makes sense.

448
00:24:07,061 --> 00:24:09,562
And yet it doesn't.

449
00:24:09,664 --> 00:24:11,631
This Mike prick
isn't from Fillory.

450
00:24:11,732 --> 00:24:15,301
Yeah.

451
00:24:15,403 --> 00:24:16,703
Hey, do you want me to--

452
00:24:16,804 --> 00:24:18,405
Is there anyone you want me
to call?

453
00:24:18,506 --> 00:24:20,573
Parents, siblings,

454
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:22,976
parole officer?

455
00:24:23,077 --> 00:24:25,912
I'm good.

456
00:24:26,013 --> 00:24:27,380
No, Quentin.

457
00:24:27,481 --> 00:24:29,449
She cared, she'd be here.

458
00:24:35,723 --> 00:24:36,790
No visitors.

459
00:24:36,891 --> 00:24:37,957
Two minutes.

460
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,192
What could he possibly say

461
00:24:39,293 --> 00:24:40,360
that would make you feel
any better?

462
00:24:40,461 --> 00:24:42,529
I'm not here to feel better.

463
00:24:44,098 --> 00:24:46,599
Please.

464
00:24:46,701 --> 00:24:51,471
I was supposed to have
a date last night.

465
00:24:51,572 --> 00:24:54,074
I got all dressed up.

466
00:24:54,175 --> 00:24:57,544
I'm sorry.

467
00:24:57,645 --> 00:25:02,415
All this stuff they're saying
I did, I don't remember.

468
00:25:02,516 --> 00:25:05,018
You were blacked out.

469
00:25:11,792 --> 00:25:14,060
Were you blacked out
when we met?

470
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:29,695
No, I don't want to buy a bible.

471
00:25:34,715 --> 00:25:38,351
What safe house were you in?

472
00:25:38,452 --> 00:25:40,720
I recognized your ink.

473
00:25:40,821 --> 00:25:44,424
You see it more often than you'd
think in a place like this.

474
00:25:44,525 --> 00:25:45,425
You're a Hedge?

475
00:25:45,526 --> 00:25:46,893
No.

476
00:25:46,994 --> 00:25:48,862
Classically trained, myself.

477
00:25:48,963 --> 00:25:53,767
There's a special school,
called Brakebills.

478
00:25:53,868 --> 00:25:56,603
You heard of it?

479
00:25:56,704 --> 00:26:00,039
Yeah. Well...
I sort of checked myself

480
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,876
in here to get away
from magic, so...

481
00:26:02,977 --> 00:26:05,945
Look, you think magic
is some terrible vice,

482
00:26:06,046 --> 00:26:09,549
so bad that you need
rehab to get clean, it's not.

483
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:12,352
Magic isn't heroin, Julia.

484
00:26:12,453 --> 00:26:13,653
It's a gift.

485
00:26:13,754 --> 00:26:16,055
Oh, God, please.
Don't say from God.

486
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,724
I'm not the guy outside of YMCA

487
00:26:17,825 --> 00:26:18,958
yelling at people to repent.

488
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:21,060
Then what are you, Richard?

489
00:26:22,997 --> 00:26:26,666
Okay, what we call magic is,

490
00:26:26,767 --> 00:26:28,735
a set of tools.

491
00:26:28,836 --> 00:26:30,670
Leftover from Creation.

492
00:26:30,771 --> 00:26:32,305
Think about it.

493
00:26:32,406 --> 00:26:34,574
The power to bend reality

494
00:26:34,675 --> 00:26:36,409
to make and unmake.

495
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:39,712
Won't God be pissed we touched
His tools without asking?

496
00:26:42,016 --> 00:26:46,186
God--
gods, really,

497
00:26:46,287 --> 00:26:48,788
they don't do things
by accident.

498
00:26:48,889 --> 00:26:51,391
The tools were left for us
to find.

499
00:26:51,492 --> 00:26:53,026
Right.

500
00:26:53,127 --> 00:26:56,362
But...

501
00:26:56,463 --> 00:26:58,565
what I'm saying,

502
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:00,300
you don't have to take
my word for it.

503
00:27:04,004 --> 00:27:06,172
See it for yourself.

504
00:27:15,683 --> 00:27:17,617
<i>Please!</i>

505
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,589
Penny?

506
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:24,958
It's just a headache.

507
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:27,093
I brought you your homework.

508
00:27:27,194 --> 00:27:29,896
- Why?
- Fair point.

509
00:27:29,997 --> 00:27:32,632
But if you were me, I'd be glad
to talk to somebody else

510
00:27:32,733 --> 00:27:34,767
who wasn't a Healing Student.

511
00:27:34,869 --> 00:27:36,836
And since Kady's not here...

512
00:27:38,472 --> 00:27:40,473
Oh, this is pity.

513
00:27:40,574 --> 00:27:43,109
No.

514
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,477
Well, kind of.

515
00:27:44,578 --> 00:27:46,018
I mean, she had shit to do
elsewhere.

516
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,080
It's--
I'm good.

517
00:27:47,147 --> 00:27:48,414
- Great.
- I am.

518
00:27:48,515 --> 00:27:52,085
I said great.
I get it.

519
00:27:52,186 --> 00:27:55,188
People are generally
disappointing.

520
00:27:55,289 --> 00:27:59,092
Yeah, be ready to pull a
ripcord at a moment's notice.

521
00:27:59,193 --> 00:28:01,961
Like if you're messing around
with some loser who...

522
00:28:02,062 --> 00:28:06,032
too obsessed with kid's books
to acknowledge he even sees you.

523
00:28:06,133 --> 00:28:08,468
Ripcord.

524
00:28:11,906 --> 00:28:14,340
Are you okay?

525
00:28:14,441 --> 00:28:16,910
Can I do anything to help?

526
00:28:19,413 --> 00:28:21,481
You want to help me,

527
00:28:21,582 --> 00:28:23,516
go to my room

528
00:28:23,617 --> 00:28:27,453
and find the bag of pills
that's stashed under my desk.

529
00:28:27,554 --> 00:28:29,489
- Pills for what?
- For--I'm a Traveler freak

530
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:31,424
who hears voices
and I do a little

531
00:28:31,525 --> 00:28:32,859
or a lot of self-medicating

532
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,029
to get them to shut
their scream-holes.

533
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,530
Penny.

534
00:28:37,631 --> 00:28:39,499
Alice, I don't need
any judgment.

535
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,401
No, Penny.

536
00:28:41,502 --> 00:28:43,336
Oh, okay.

537
00:28:46,473 --> 00:28:47,941
Hey, look.

538
00:28:50,344 --> 00:28:53,112
That's--that's not great.

539
00:28:53,213 --> 00:28:54,914
Can someone get Quentin?

540
00:28:55,015 --> 00:28:56,382
Now!

541
00:28:56,483 --> 00:28:58,751
This is not what I pictured.

542
00:28:58,852 --> 00:29:01,154
It's from the fourth
Fillory book.

543
00:29:01,255 --> 00:29:03,423
I read them all for research.

544
00:29:03,524 --> 00:29:07,293
Yeah, Jane, she was alone
in Fillory for the first time

545
00:29:07,394 --> 00:29:09,429
when she was attacked
by a Lorian assassin.

546
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,090
- What's Lorian?
- They're the bad guys.

547
00:29:11,165 --> 00:29:12,405
Uh, from a neighboring kingdom.

548
00:29:12,433 --> 00:29:13,766
It's actually
really interesting,

549
00:29:13,867 --> 00:29:16,302
because Fillory is both,
the name of the landmass

550
00:29:16,403 --> 00:29:17,637
and also the one
of the sovereign states--

551
00:29:17,738 --> 00:29:20,506
Quentin, focus, please.

552
00:29:20,607 --> 00:29:21,641
Ah, yeah.

553
00:29:21,742 --> 00:29:26,079
Ah, um, so the Lorian
stabbed Jane

554
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,660
with something
called the Virgo Blade.

555
00:29:27,748 --> 00:29:30,683
And, uh, Rose vines grew
from the wounds--

556
00:29:30,784 --> 00:29:32,986
This seems to be
the way grosser,

557
00:29:33,087 --> 00:29:35,989
less whimsical version of that.

558
00:29:36,090 --> 00:29:38,358
Um, this guy, Honeyclaw,
he was taking care of Jane.

559
00:29:38,459 --> 00:29:39,726
Honeyclaw?

560
00:29:39,827 --> 00:29:42,161
- Yeah. A-a talking bear.
- Oh, Jesus.

561
00:29:42,262 --> 00:29:44,702
Honeyclaw said that the vines
would keep growing and growing

562
00:29:44,732 --> 00:29:50,036
until they strangled her heart,
um, but Jane survived.

563
00:29:50,137 --> 00:29:51,604
Penny, I know how to fix this.

564
00:29:55,677 --> 00:29:56,863
Is that a turban?

565
00:29:57,198 --> 00:29:58,757
No, it's your hair.

566
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,584
Sewing is not really my thing.

567
00:30:02,403 --> 00:30:04,471
How is a voodoo doll
is supposed to help me?

568
00:30:04,572 --> 00:30:06,339
Um, so, in the books,

569
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,942
Jane carried this doll with her
everywhere she goes,

570
00:30:09,043 --> 00:30:10,944
and it looks just like her.

571
00:30:11,045 --> 00:30:14,380
And so they realized
that the curse

572
00:30:14,482 --> 00:30:17,684
of the Virgo Blade would accept
the doll as a substitute.

573
00:30:19,153 --> 00:30:21,955
So, we burn a doll?

574
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:48,581
Okay, what else did your dumb
book says?

575
00:30:48,682 --> 00:30:50,550
Henry.

576
00:30:50,651 --> 00:30:52,452
It is considered good form

577
00:30:52,553 --> 00:30:54,587
to announce oneself
to blind people.

578
00:30:54,688 --> 00:30:57,557
My glasses only show me
your outline...vaguely.

579
00:30:57,658 --> 00:31:00,560
In my defense, I was raised
by wolves for a time.

580
00:31:00,661 --> 00:31:03,730
The knife
that Penny was stabbed with...

581
00:31:03,831 --> 00:31:05,431
is from Fillory.

582
00:31:05,533 --> 00:31:09,736
Something called the--
the Virgo Blade.

583
00:31:09,837 --> 00:31:11,905
- And you're familiar?
- Yes.

584
00:31:12,006 --> 00:31:14,407
This is a first.

585
00:31:14,508 --> 00:31:17,143
You should've called for me
much sooner.

586
00:31:17,244 --> 00:31:20,446
Quentin's the most at risk,
but if Penny dies...

587
00:31:20,548 --> 00:31:23,316
This is your mess, Eliza.

588
00:31:24,652 --> 00:31:26,819
Clean it up.

589
00:31:26,921 --> 00:31:32,659
Then, get as far away
from my university as possible.

590
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,061
Do you understand?

591
00:31:40,034 --> 00:31:43,303
Mr. Coldwater, I don't have
a lot of time at the moment.

592
00:31:43,404 --> 00:31:44,837
It is the Beast, isn't it?

593
00:31:44,939 --> 00:31:46,806
And he's from Fillory,
which is real.

594
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:48,474
Of course Fillory is real.

595
00:31:48,576 --> 00:31:50,076
You've known that
since you were a child.

596
00:31:50,177 --> 00:31:52,045
It's why you're here.

597
00:31:52,146 --> 00:31:54,314
Okay, but there's no Beast
in the books.

598
00:31:54,415 --> 00:31:57,150
The books are a child's
drawing of Fillory.

599
00:31:57,251 --> 00:31:59,519
The real thing is stranger.

600
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,721
Yeah, it's full
of psychopathic monsters

601
00:32:01,822 --> 00:32:02,989
who are trying to kill me.

602
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,650
You want to know
what the Beast wants?

603
00:32:04,692 --> 00:32:06,025
I'll tell you exactly.

604
00:32:06,126 --> 00:32:07,994
He wants control of Fillory

605
00:32:08,095 --> 00:32:09,529
and all the doors
that lead there.

606
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:13,299
Maybe, he thinks
you'll find one of them.

607
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,069
- I'm not a Traveler.
- There are other ways.

608
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,570
I gave you a book about it.

609
00:32:17,671 --> 00:32:19,706
"Fillory and Further, Book Six"?

610
00:32:19,807 --> 00:32:20,873
I told you.
I lost it.

611
00:32:20,975 --> 00:32:23,610
And nothing lost was ever found?

612
00:32:23,711 --> 00:32:25,278
Wait, there's, uh--
What about Penny?

613
00:32:25,379 --> 00:32:26,646
There's got to be
something we can do.

614
00:32:26,747 --> 00:32:29,382
You need to read between
the lines, Quentin.

615
00:32:29,483 --> 00:32:33,286
Jane's doll wasn't special
because it looked like Jane.

616
00:32:33,387 --> 00:32:36,322
Was special because
of where it came from.

617
00:32:36,423 --> 00:32:39,325
<i>Jane's mother gave it to her...</i>

618
00:32:39,426 --> 00:32:41,427
<i>before she died.</i>

619
00:32:43,631 --> 00:32:47,033
<i>It was all she took with her
to Fillory.</i>

620
00:32:47,134 --> 00:32:50,870
<i>Her only reminder of her family
and her life on Earth.</i>

621
00:32:50,971 --> 00:32:54,707
<i>It was her most precious
possession.</i>

622
00:32:54,808 --> 00:32:58,344
<i>What we love can be as
important to us as our lives.</i>

623
00:32:58,445 --> 00:33:01,981
So, the curse accepted the doll

624
00:33:02,082 --> 00:33:04,951
as a proper sacrifice
in place of Jane's heart.

625
00:33:07,554 --> 00:33:10,289
I know you have more questions

626
00:33:10,391 --> 00:33:12,992
after you save your friend.

627
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:18,731
I found a way to break
the curse,

628
00:33:18,832 --> 00:33:20,933
I just need a--
Penny!

629
00:33:21,035 --> 00:33:24,170
Hey, asshole, I need to know
your most precious possession.

630
00:33:24,271 --> 00:33:26,339
He's been out of it for like,
20 minutes.

631
00:33:28,475 --> 00:33:30,343
Then, it's too late.

632
00:33:46,593 --> 00:33:51,097
I beseech and devote myself.

633
00:33:52,366 --> 00:33:55,968
I plead and promise myself...

634
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,837
to you,

635
00:33:57,938 --> 00:34:00,173
She of the Grain,

636
00:34:00,274 --> 00:34:04,077
that you would raise me
up above the chaff.

637
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,947
Amen?

638
00:34:08,048 --> 00:34:09,415
<i>♪ You can still be ♪</i>

639
00:34:09,516 --> 00:34:11,451
<i>♪ What you want to</i> ♪

640
00:34:11,552 --> 00:34:13,853

646

<i>♪ You ♪</i>

647
00:34:39,677 --> 00:34:40,744
How are we supposed to know
what's important?

648
00:34:40,984 --> 00:34:42,284
I don't know. Penny doesn't
have that much stuff,

649
00:34:42,386 --> 00:34:45,688
we'll just go through it.

650
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:49,505
Pictures.
Yeah, maybe it's something

651
00:34:49,606 --> 00:34:50,939
from his childhood, his family.

652
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,541
He doesn't ever talk about them.

653
00:34:52,642 --> 00:34:53,876
Doesn't mean he doesn't care
about them.

654
00:34:53,977 --> 00:34:55,711
Penny's not
the most sentimental type.

655
00:34:55,812 --> 00:34:57,846
Well, maybe he carefully
crafts that image,

656
00:34:57,947 --> 00:34:59,715
I don't know.
Everyone is sentimental.

657
00:34:59,816 --> 00:35:02,484
- You're projecting.
- You're projecting!

658
00:35:04,487 --> 00:35:06,522
Okay.

659
00:35:06,623 --> 00:35:09,124
I'm getting a definite
circus clown vibe here.

660
00:35:09,225 --> 00:35:10,993
Q, this is it.

661
00:35:11,094 --> 00:35:13,629
You think, Penny's most prized
possession is his Adderall?

662
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:15,397
I have voices telling me,
all day long,

663
00:35:15,498 --> 00:35:16,999
to do dark magic
and I don't know,

664
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,834
the pills were the one thing
that make them stop,

665
00:35:18,935 --> 00:35:20,536
- they'd be pretty precious.
- You can always get more pills.

666
00:35:20,637 --> 00:35:22,004
They're fungible.

667
00:35:22,105 --> 00:35:23,405
You're fungible.

668
00:35:23,506 --> 00:35:25,941
Okay, what's yours, hmm?

669
00:35:26,042 --> 00:35:27,962
That's kind of a personal
question for two people

670
00:35:28,044 --> 00:35:29,912
who aren't supposed to be
in the same room?

671
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:32,848
What's yours?

672
00:35:35,919 --> 00:35:38,119
A quilt that my grandmother
made me when I was little.

673
00:35:40,323 --> 00:35:42,024
It's covered in cats.

674
00:35:43,593 --> 00:35:46,595
"Fillory and Further",
book one, first edition.

675
00:35:46,696 --> 00:35:49,264
I worked all summer
before eight grade to get it.

676
00:35:49,365 --> 00:35:51,900
It's predictable I know.

677
00:35:52,001 --> 00:35:53,702
Predictable's not bad, Quentin.

678
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:02,678
Hey.

679
00:36:02,779 --> 00:36:05,180
What about this?

680
00:36:05,281 --> 00:36:07,082
A candy bar wrapper?

681
00:36:07,183 --> 00:36:08,343
It's from Brakebills South.

682
00:36:08,418 --> 00:36:10,319
This is the last place
that he saw Kady.

683
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:13,522
Quentin, I don't think Penny
even cares that she's gone.

684
00:36:13,623 --> 00:36:16,124
Believe me.

685
00:36:16,226 --> 00:36:17,593
He does.

686
00:36:47,357 --> 00:36:49,691
What was that?
That you gave me?

687
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,260
Did it work?

688
00:36:51,361 --> 00:36:53,328
It didn't feel like
I was doing a casting,

689
00:36:53,429 --> 00:36:56,331
it felt like a casting
was being done on me.

690
00:36:56,432 --> 00:36:58,834
It's because it's not a spell,
it was a prayer.

691
00:36:58,935 --> 00:37:01,870
- To what?
- Local harvest deity.

692
00:37:01,971 --> 00:37:03,639
Friendly,
but a little one-trick.

693
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,807
You're lucky she answered.
She's pretty shy.

694
00:37:05,909 --> 00:37:08,710
It's like touching a bare wire.

695
00:37:08,811 --> 00:37:11,079
More energy than I've felt.

696
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,247
It felt good.

697
00:37:12,348 --> 00:37:14,917
It felt...dangerous.

698
00:37:17,921 --> 00:37:20,923
The reason you treat magic
like a drug,

699
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,758
is because the people
that taught it to you

700
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:24,259
act like drug dealers.

701
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,994
They buy it and they sell it,

702
00:37:26,095 --> 00:37:28,964
and they fight
and they fuck for it.

703
00:37:29,065 --> 00:37:32,234
Well, that's not
the only way to live.

704
00:37:32,335 --> 00:37:34,903
That's the only way
I've ever seen.

705
00:37:35,004 --> 00:37:38,607
I'm a very good Magician

706
00:37:38,708 --> 00:37:41,143
and I do this.

707
00:37:41,244 --> 00:37:43,312
There are good people
out there, Julia.

708
00:37:43,413 --> 00:37:44,947
People trying to learn
about the world

709
00:37:45,048 --> 00:37:46,715
and make it a better place.

710
00:37:46,816 --> 00:37:48,684
Now, you can be
one of those people,

711
00:37:48,785 --> 00:37:51,186
you can be a dealer,

712
00:37:51,287 --> 00:37:54,456
you can stay here
and be nothing.

713
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:58,794
You get to choose.

714
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:10,439
If I give you something,

715
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:13,008
you think you can get it
into Brakebills for me?

716
00:38:16,145 --> 00:38:18,213
Don't bother
with the performance.

717
00:38:18,314 --> 00:38:21,216
Even with these wards,
I can see right through you.

718
00:38:21,317 --> 00:38:23,585
I wouldn't dream of fooling you.

719
00:38:23,686 --> 00:38:26,054
I have far bigger dreams
than that.

720
00:38:26,155 --> 00:38:28,457
Very clever,
targeting someone else

721
00:38:28,558 --> 00:38:30,058
outside the campus protections.

722
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:32,561
Graduate with an alumni key.

723
00:38:32,662 --> 00:38:36,264
Attractive to a certain sort.

724
00:38:36,366 --> 00:38:37,366
It won't work next time.

725
00:38:37,467 --> 00:38:38,734
There won't be a next time.

726
00:38:38,835 --> 00:38:40,469
You can't hide
in Fillory forever.

727
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,204
Lock as many doors as you want,

728
00:38:42,305 --> 00:38:44,406
there's always a door to Fillory
when you need one.

729
00:38:44,507 --> 00:38:46,108
Nothing's changed.

730
00:38:46,209 --> 00:38:50,145
Still the same determined
little Jane Chatwin.

731
00:38:50,246 --> 00:38:52,481
No, I never wanted this.

732
00:38:52,582 --> 00:38:55,984
You forced my hand.
I wish I could be any other way.

733
00:38:56,085 --> 00:38:59,821
I picked the Virgo Blade,
specially for you, Jane.

734
00:38:59,922 --> 00:39:01,790
Little twinge of nostalgia.

735
00:39:01,891 --> 00:39:05,260
Penny's going to live
and this meat puppet of yours

736
00:39:05,361 --> 00:39:07,696
is going to a Salvadorian prison
in the morning.

737
00:39:07,797 --> 00:39:09,598
All that scheming, wasted.

738
00:39:09,699 --> 00:39:12,034
I could walk out of here
anytime I like.

739
00:39:12,135 --> 00:39:15,437
If you can leave anytime,
what are you waiting for?

740
00:39:15,538 --> 00:39:18,507
Oh, I was waiting...

741
00:39:18,608 --> 00:39:19,975
for you.

742
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:26,680
Help me!

743
00:39:58,713 --> 00:40:00,880
Oh, my God.
Wait, wait, wait.

744
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:48,495
Dean Fogg.

745
00:40:52,433 --> 00:40:54,000
What do we do?

746
00:40:56,337 --> 00:40:58,104
What do we do?

747
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:00,073
I don't--I don't know.

748
00:41:00,174 --> 00:41:01,708
Fuck that.

749
00:41:03,677 --> 00:41:05,879
Eliza is dead. I--

750
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:08,581
When the Beast comes back,
what are we su--

751
00:41:08,682 --> 00:41:11,151
She is the only one who could
actually give me answers.

752
00:41:11,252 --> 00:41:14,888
There are no answers, Quentin.

753
00:41:14,989 --> 00:41:19,626
Because we have no idea
what's going to happen next.

754
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:23,096
Most likely outcome:

755
00:41:23,197 --> 00:41:24,831
The Beast comes back.

756
00:41:24,932 --> 00:41:29,536
Specially now that he's gotten
Eliza out of the way.

757
00:41:29,637 --> 00:41:31,438
You die,

758
00:41:31,539 --> 00:41:33,973
your friends die,

759
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:36,376
we all die

760
00:41:36,477 --> 00:41:38,611
very bloody.

761
00:41:41,182 --> 00:41:44,651
And all of this,

762
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,821
will have been for nothing.

763
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,233
Are you okay?

764
00:42:25,531 --> 00:42:35,597

# The Writing Room

Plover's previous work, uh, he--well, he only got rejections for it. It just didn't really show the depth of the "Fillory and Further" series.

Stay close. I'm not sure I can do this tour without you.

---

Hey, would you break up with me if I told you that I've never been happier in my entire life?

---

The world never did help a smart girl. Why would it? We scare the shit out of the world.

---

What do you think redemption looks like, Julia? Being nice? Donating shoes to Africa? You think that really burns the tumors off your soul?

---

What am I supposed to do?

Whichever's hardest.

# Homecoming

I respect the shit out of you both, and you are leaders, and you're people, and I'm a feminist--

If you would just shut up for two seconds, this sex dream would pass the Bechdel test, Quentin.

---

Every book is here--all the books ever written, all the books never written, all the books of all the people who ever lived.

This is my book. Yo. Why are there all these flowers and shit on the cover?

People who read their books often discover they don't like the main character and are rarely happy with how it ends.

# Remedial Battle Magic

Well, I hate to say I told you so, but--you know what? Actually, I don't. I don't. I don't hate that.

---

We need some serious battle magic.

But that stuff's illegal. I'm fucking with you. I'm in.

---

Penny, you will never have a home. You will never have a real family. Your gifts will take this from you over and over. So when someone cares enough to reach out a hand, just drop the bullshit attitude and take what they're offering while you can.

---

If you can read my mind, you know that we both have knives in our pockets dipped in gold and silver and coated in shark's blood.

Jesus, that's overkill.

We weren't sure which legends were true.

---

I mean, what do you want me to say? "I give up"? "Forget about ever really fixing anything"? No, we keep trying, okay? At least I do. You do whatever you want.

Well, I'm not going anywhere. I mean, this is my house.

---

There's this thing about you, Q. You actually believe in magic.

So does everyone.

No. We all knows it's real, but you believe in it.

---

So Midori, hmm? Does it work?

Nothing works forever. But, you know, if you stop worrying about forever, there's plenty of shit that can get you through the next hour.

---

That bite, that-- that thing in you that wants to puzzle everything out, that is gold.

No matter how crabby it makes me?

I think especially when it makes you crabby.

---

I think that us angry, questioning people sometimes shut up too fast, and that is probably part of why the gods took off. No one around with the fire to keep yelling their names. This is gonna sound corny, but don't lose that fire.

---

Penny, Alice, Eliot, and Janet, you are all late.

Actually, it's Margo.

This time.

# Have You Brought Me Little Cakes?

You're not as good as I hoped, Quentin Coldwater.

But you're better than you know.

---

You can't unring a bell.

# Knight Of Crowns

Witch: You're in Fillory, Magician. Be careful with strangers. We only look whimsical.

---

Eliot: We'll figure it out. We always do.

Margo: When it's a final to cheat on, not when we're stuck in some epic fantasy that likes to behead its heroes halfway through season one.

If we even are heroes.

We might be comic relief.

---

Alice: I have no idea what to do now.

Margo: So we are fucked without grease.

Quentin: That sounds like us.

Eliot: Must be a Monday.

Onward to glory.

---

Martin: "Tweet"? Birds have computer accounts?

Julia: Don't worry about it.

---

Julia: He's still in Richard's body.

Martin: Richard doesn't care, darling.

Julia: I f\*cking do.

---

Knight of Crowns: As you know, only a Child Of Earth can wear the crown of the High King.

I will ask you a series of questions designed to root out all pretenders to the throne.

Only a true High King will hold the answers in his heart.

Eliot: Come at me.

Knight of Crowns: What popular American television program stars actor Tim Daly?

---

Eliot: Ask me something about Patrick Swayze.

Knight of Crowns: You know of Swayze?

---

Eliot: I do hereby crown you High Queen Margo the Destroyer.

I mean that in the best possible sense.

---

Margo: Uh, I could start by saying something cruel yet totally hilarious about you.

Let's be real, you're an easy target.

But that's-- well, that's because you're honest about what you love.

And underneath it all, that's... inspiring.

---

Margo: Now that we're ruling a kingdom together, I hope we can be whatever we were again.

Quentin: I guess you could call that friends.

Margo: Let's go with that.

I hereby crown you King Quentin the Moderately Socially Maladjusted.

---

Martin: It's called a Shade.

Julia: Shade.

Martin: It's what makes you feel the pain will burn you till there's nothing.

And, yes, it's also there for love, but, uh, let's be frank, darling, you're more likely to throw yourself off a bridge than ever love again.

---

Eliot: You know, it's considered extremely disrespectful to touch a king without permission.

But, um, I think you should... probably hug me right now.

[exhales deeply]

It'll also be okay if you just give my ass, like, a little squeeze.

# Hotel Spa Potions

---

Martin: All I do is accept what you fight.

Julia: Yeah. Which is?

Martin: Life is pointless.

The after-life even more so.

Which is why we invent these games to fill the void of existence.

Who diddled whom. Who'll get revenge for it.

Who takes the throne.

---

Fen: I'm your wife. I want to be obedient.

Eliot: Sit down.

Nobody wants to be obedient.

---

Quentin: If it hurts, then...

Alice: Not everything that hurts is bad.

---

Marina: I was the best student you ever had here. You said that.

Dean Fogg: I confused talent with character. You need both to be a true magician, Marina.

---

Dean Fogg: You can keep your memories. I hope that whatever you've learned here will help keep you safe.

Marina: What I learned here will get me killed.

---

Bigby: Humans least attractive qualities. Panic and paranoia.

Dean Fogg: And there were several student deaths that semester.

Bigby: Far fewer than the 1870s, or the 1920s, or the '60s. Another human failing, short memory.

---

Bigby: I can feel your power. It's almost... [chuckles] it's almost god-like.

Did you fuck one of them? I mean, they are wonderful, aren't they? At least mine was.

I glowed for weeks. No, literally.

# Divine Elimination

Eliot: The spell that won World War II is called the Rhinemann Ultra?

Sounds like a not-so-great beer.

---

Penny: Wait, is this really the most important thing we could be doing right now? I mean, The Beast is still out there waiting for us...

Eliot: The Beast can wait for five minutes. You are all Kings and Queens of Fillory. Well, almost all of you. Just revel in your majesty for one f\*cking second. Be regal, miscreants.

---

Eliot: Because I promise you...I will not go down easily.

Oo-surpers.

Usurpers.

[sighs]

Whichever way you're supposed to pronounce it.

---

Marina: [sarcastically] I call on you.

Our Lady Underground.

As a child of the Earth...

I seek you, O Mother.

Julia: Hey.

Marina: Mm?

Julia: Do me a favor and just believe it.

Marina: A benevolent Mommy who will solve my problems with her Gaia power?

Julia: Yeah. Or Reynard won't show.

Marina: You realize I don't even own a pair of yoga pants.

---

Quentin: What's so funny?

Margo: You with a crossbow.

You couldn't hit a fat girl with a fat-girl-seeking arrow.

Oh, don't give me that look.

It's a figure of speech.

---

Reynard: You're all alone, aren't you?

There's... no else in your life.

Marina: Seriously? Trying to hurt my feelings?

And the best you can come up with is "why couldn't you find a man?"

Reynard: Is anyone really gonna miss you?

Marina: I tip the pizza guy pretty well.

---

Margo: Well, if those horses get us there before The Beast, I'll gladly f\*ck them both.

Eliot: Hey. Shh. Careful. Volume.

I think those are talking horses.

Margo: Offer stands.

---

Quentin: Look. You've changed. Okay.

You are not the girl that I met a million years ago.

You are amazing.

And not that you weren't amazing before, but...

Alice: Quentin, where are you going with this?

Quentin: You've grown.

And you're still growing, and my point is that I am too.

Alice: Are you saying you're "not that guy anymore"?

Quentin: No, I'm saying that I'm not just that guy anymore, and I think that you...I hope that you give me the opportunity to be better and actually deserve you.

---

Ember: I'm going. I just had one or two things to do.

Mainly number two.

I have befouled the Wellspring.

Martin: Pardon me?

Ember: I have left my divine elimination in the font of all magic.

And it's a stinker.

I really hope you weren't planning to drink from it.

It's hardly potable.

Martin: You... what?

Ember: Left my leavings... a godly floater... behind.

In the Wellspring.

I pooped in it.

Am I not making this very clear?

---

Eliot: I guess we're gonna die.

Margo: To our pretty corpses.

# The Flying Forest

Margo: Can you give us a moment?

I said get the fuck out.

---

Eliot: Todd, answer truthfully.

Are you wearing my vest?

Todd: I am wearing your vest.

Eliot: Keep it. [sighs] New plan-- I give up on Fillory and dedicate myself completely to destroying Todd.

---

Eliot: I'm married... to a woman.

Javier: I have a boyfriend. but he's on another continent, so... it doesn't count.

And where is your wife?

Eliot: On another planet.

Javier: [scoffs] Definitely doesn't count.

---

Dean Fogg: Ember shat in the Wellspring.

Eliot: [sighs] I think he meant well. He probably didn't know how hard it would be to clean out.

Dean Fogg: And now magic is failing on Earth... because of shit, proving once again that comedy and tragedy can coexist in the same goddamn sentence.

---

Julia: You actually think because you go to this bullshit school that you're better than me.

Margo: I think I didn't get my friends killed.

Julia: You don't have friends.

You have people that are so afraid of you, they'd rather be on your side.

There's a difference.

---

The White Lady: What is it, Quentin Coldwater, that you ache for? You have a crown and the power to reshape the very ether to your whim. What else could you possibly want?

---

Penny: Um, technically speaking, uh, we both caught you, so...

Quentin: Shut up. I'll ask for your thing with my third wish.

Penny: No. We each get a wish, and then we have one mutually agreeable third wish.

The White Lady: You can each have one wish, or you can fuck off.

---

The White Lady: But you should know... there's nothing I can give you that will soothe your Shade.

There's only what I can take away.

Quentin: You'd take away my memories of Alice?

The White Lady: Yes. I would free you completely.

Quentin: No.

The White Lady: You are wiser than you appear. You would find your way back to sadness, no matter how far you run from it.

---

# Cheat Day
