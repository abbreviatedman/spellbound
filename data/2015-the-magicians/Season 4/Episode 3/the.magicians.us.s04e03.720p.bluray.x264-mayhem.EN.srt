The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,628 --> 00:00:04,290
Are you Santa Claus?

3
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:06,253
Well, I'm not, not that.

4
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:07,417
Magic's gone.

5
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:08,749
I'm not a magician,

6
00:00:08,884 --> 00:00:10,341
but I could feel it
when it was gone,

7
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:11,747
and I knew it wasn't
a coincidence

8
00:00:11,887 --> 00:00:14,300
when I went into remission
a week later.

9
00:00:14,598 --> 00:00:15,759
What timeline are you from?

10
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,369
The one where
you owe me child support.

11
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:18,434
I'm kidding.

12
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,330
Okay, then if you want me
to help these students,

13
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:21,686
can you tell me who they are?

14
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:23,934
Their lives were
in grave danger.

15
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,392
<i>I cast a spell that erased their
identities and gave them new ones.</i>

16
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:28,880
I mean, isn't there
anything you can do?

17
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:31,191
If I reveal that
the spell can be reversed,

18
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:32,717
then someone would
reverse the spell.

19
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,446
Bacchus,
what are you doing here?

20
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,101
Why do you want everyone
thinking you're Ember?

21
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,707
Thanks for popping in.

22
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,081
Oh, my God.

23
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:47,419
<i>Mis hermanos.</i>

24
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:49,418
Where were you?
We looked everywhere.

25
00:00:49,508 --> 00:00:50,749
- Stay back.
- Why?

26
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,750
Because I'm not here to play.

27
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,591
Marina.

28
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,886
Why do you look like
you're fleeing something?

29
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:03,011
It's me, Margo,
previously known as Janet.

30
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,350
Look, I'm gonna
do you a solid.

31
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,352
- Don't go up there.
- Why?

32
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,809
Because there's an uninvited
guest in my apartment

33
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,190
who's probably killing
your friends right about now.

34
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:14,898
Look, I don't know what he is,
and I'm assuming it's a "he"

35
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:17,530
because this is some
toxically masculine behavior,

36
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:20,612
but he walked through
every ward and shield I had,

37
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:22,413
set off every alarm.

38
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,081
So, instead of going inside,

39
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,749
I'm gonna get
a breakfast burrito.

40
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:28,123
- You wanna join?
- We have to help them.

41
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,455
Oh. You're one of those.

42
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:32,923
Fine, you wanna
stick your neck out?

43
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,690
There's something inside
that can help you.

44
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,053
Do tell.

45
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:40,014
No traveling.

46
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:41,511
Where to start?

47
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,594
Order is important
with these things.

48
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:46,805
Who goes first?
Who goes last?

49
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,939
Oh, you keep looking at him.

50
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,976
Because you don't want him
to die?

51
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,776
Which means he has to go
before you.

52
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,945
You care about all of them.

53
00:01:59,995 --> 00:02:00,995
So, you're last.

54
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:06,867
Thank Christ.

55
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,041
Wait, wait, wait.

56
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,336
Not Eliot.

57
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,755
<i>This thing has
god-level power,</i>

58
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:15,340
and I have a bad history
with gods,

59
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:17,510
since apparently
one killed me.

60
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:19,013
No, it's fine.

61
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:21,621
Different me, but I didn't want
to get caught off guard again,

62
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:24,096
so I called in
every favor I had

63
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:25,677
to build a defense system.

64
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,642
All you have to do is get him
to sit in the gold chair.

65
00:02:28,732 --> 00:02:29,813
Why the gold chair?

66
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,357
Because it had
to be something,

67
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:33,230
<i>and everybody wants to
sit in the gold chair.</i>

68
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,481
<i>It's a total power move.</i>

69
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:37,481
I'm so glad you came.

70
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,736
Saves me having
to hunt you down.

71
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,652
I've got so much
of that ahead of me already.

72
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:44,946
What is he talking about?

73
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,908
He's, uh, hunting gods.

74
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:51,461
It's vengeance
for locking you in the castle.

75
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,791
They did more than that,

76
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,005
and so did you.

77
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,292
You tried to kill me.

78
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,298
You were all part of it.

79
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,599
Then what?

80
00:03:10,399 --> 00:03:11,731
There's a bell on the table.

81
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:12,894
Ring it.

82
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:16,526
And he explodes?

83
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,521
He gets a face full
of distilled ambrosia.

84
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,151
It's basically meth for gods.

85
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:22,154
<i>It gets them high,
but an overdose</i>

86
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:23,485
<i>will knock them
on their asses.</i>

87
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,702
Tell me Eliot is still
in there somewhere.

88
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,158
Not that I've seen.

89
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:32,911
Your round, innocent face

90
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:35,246
will make your death
particularly upsetting,

91
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,628
so, I've decided
to start with you.

92
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,428
I can give you Bacchus.

93
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,092
You're hunting gods,

94
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,724
and I found him
hiding someplace far away.

95
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:53,647
Hiding from you, right?

96
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,021
I can take you there

97
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,312
if you let them live.

98
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,440
All of them.

99
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:10,331
Perhaps we can be friends
after all.

100
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,931
So, where is everyone else?

101
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,304
I don't know.

102
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,769
You were
supposed to remain hidden.

103
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,890
I meant to protect you.

104
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,061
Doesn't really seem
like I need protection.

105
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,605
I mean, nothing
your spell threw at me

106
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,906
even left a scratch.

107
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,617
Reynard did say,
even without their powers,

108
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:47,944
gods are hard to kill.

109
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:53,124
I wouldn't underestimate
the will of Irene McAllistair.

110
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,333
Ah.

111
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,961
Tell a few people
that you're leaving forever,

112
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:00,256
and look what
the ungrateful bastards do.

113
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,876
Ah, yes.

114
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:05,845
You know,
if the deal is broken

115
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,116
and the McAllistairs
are coming,

116
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,381
I'm gonna have to
warn everyone.

117
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:12,640
Contacting your friends will
put a target on their backs.

118
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:14,854
To be clear,

119
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,353
you put the target
on our backs.

120
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:19,434
You betrayed us.

121
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:21,028
Hmm.

122
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,647
I sacrificed everything
to bring back magic.

123
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,399
You know what I sacrificed,

124
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:28,238
and look what you do with it.

125
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,618
Yes, Ms. Wicker,

126
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,918
I made a deal

127
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,665
with the goddamn Library,

128
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,169
and in doing so,
I saved your lives.

129
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,821
Yeah, well, you're pretty
fucking quick to compromise,

130
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,052
you know that?

131
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,050
Now, I need to
find my friends,

132
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,176
but I can't do magic,

133
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:52,850
so you're going to cast
the locator spell for me.

134
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,198
Dean Fogg. Finally.

135
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:17,750
I only have a moment.

136
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,128
You know how the Library

137
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:24,465
contains the books of everyone
who ever lived?

138
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,715
Yeah.

139
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,211
The Great Blank Spot is over.

140
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,755
The Library can update
their books again.

141
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,639
So, if your friends were
to get their memories back,

142
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:37,727
the Library would know.

143
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,642
They'd try to find them

144
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,941
to keep them safe

145
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,986
from the Monster
that you warned us about.

146
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,903
<i>You're telling me
they have books that describe</i>

147
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:52,489
every damn thing everyone does
or ever will do,

148
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,946
when you're sleeping,
when you're awake,

149
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,201
naughty or nice?

150
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,328
You know how much time
that would have saved me?

151
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:00,619
Can we please not
with the Santa stuff right now?

152
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:03,204
Well, could you please not
with the angsty, nerdy stuff, huh?

153
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,255
No, 'cause that's who you are,

154
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,166
and I don't judge you for it.

155
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,900
Dean Fogg was trying
to give me a message.

156
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,797
Look, if we escape,
they'll just read our books,

157
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,490
find out where we are,
and come after us.

158
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:15,512
So, we just take
the books with us,

159
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,514
or destroy 'em.

160
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:20,141
But first we have
to actually escape.

161
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,811
I can get us to the fireplace.

162
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:26,569
Just be ready.

163
00:07:28,323 --> 00:07:30,440
All I'm offering
is a location.

164
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,899
The rest is on you.

165
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,905
Knowing where Bacchus is

166
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,827
doesn't help me
if he runs away,

167
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,122
which he'll do
the second I show up.

168
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,907
You see my problem,

169
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,459
and how maybe it is just
easier to kill you all.

170
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,586
Do you know what this is?

171
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:02,187
Where did you get that?

172
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,731
I didn't,

173
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,129
but I know that enough of it
will mess up a god long enough

174
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,065
for you to do
whatever you need to do.

175
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,817
Excuse me, Margo?

176
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,318
Quick talk?

177
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:20,118
Could you stop volunteering?

178
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,207
I know Bacchus. He's a friend.

179
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,285
Great.

180
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:26,120
Then you'll poison him.

181
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,046
He'll never suspect a friend.

182
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,006
I could always kill you.

183
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,259
Awesome.

184
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,349
Great choices.

185
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,346
Well, let's get going, then.

186
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,851
Guys, in case it even needs
to be said,

187
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:42,974
I know Marina.

188
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,305
She is not a helpful person.

189
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,935
So, just act accordingly.

190
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,235
Of course I'm getting paid.

191
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,969
The McAllistairs have
a bounty on your heads,

192
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,109
dead or alive.

193
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,613
The real yous,

194
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,195
not the witness-protection
identities.

195
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,049
So, you can see how
it'd be profitable for me

196
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,285
to get you back to normal.

197
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,375
What are they offering?

198
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,460
- Three Deweys.
- What the hell's a Dewey?

199
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:08,955
As in Melvil Dewey,

200
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,836
the most famous librarian
of all time.

201
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,132
He has his own decimal system.

202
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,627
Well, I think you're being generous
with the word "famous."

203
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,302
Okay, so in
the New World Order,

204
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,425
there is just enough magic
in the air

205
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,681
to keep the boring masses
fat and happy,

206
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,809
but you got an itch
to do something bigger,

207
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,232
you have to file a request
with the Library.

208
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,441
They decide if you're
trustworthy, and they give you

209
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:32,247
a cute little battery
in the shape of a coin.

210
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,696
They put the faces of famous
librarians on there,

211
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:36,543
but Dewey's the only one
people can remember.

212
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:40,695
Well, and Laura Bush,
but Bushes just never stuck.

213
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:43,336
All right, well,
we'll pay the bounty ourselves.

214
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,286
How are you gonna get Deweys?

215
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:46,854
I don't know.
We'll figure it out.

216
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,369
- We always...
- Sometimes.

217
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,625
Most of the time, we do.

218
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,010
Five Deweys to make it
worth the delay,

219
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,283
and know that I have trackers
on all of you,

220
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:02,425
so if you try to run,
it won't go your way.

221
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:09,936
Don't drink all my beer.

222
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,027
Seems like this is the place.

223
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,282
It is.

224
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,910
Those are Maenads,
Bacchus followers.

225
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,699
Get to it, then.

226
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:32,000
Oh, and if they have pizza,
bring me some.

227
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,173
We can still find a way out.

228
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,927
We already did. This is it.
We're doing it right now.

229
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,494
You have a weapon that
could have stopped him,

230
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,430
and instead of using it,
you gave it to him.

231
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,012
We tried that already with
Julia's god-killing bullet.

232
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,583
All it did was kill
The Monster's host,

233
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:50,848
which in this case is Eliot.

234
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,525
Who, for all we know, is dead.

235
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:57,984
Or he's trapped in there,

236
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,802
forced to watch everything
The Monster does,

237
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,364
just waiting for us
to find a way to help him.

238
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,114
What are you gonna
slip the ambrosia into?

239
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:12,252
I guess I'll make a Fillorian
version of his favorite drink,

240
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,955
margarita, but instead of
salt on the rim, it will be...

241
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,915
God meth. Perfect.

242
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,219
Now go poison his ass so we can
get out of this malarial swamp.

243
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,466
You know what's incredible?

244
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:22,842
How you can be
such a good friend

245
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,140
and such a terrible friend
at the exact same time.

246
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,266
There's not a lot

247
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,568
that I can relate to
in this world.

248
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:40,318
People here are,

249
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:44,486
well, people, generally,

250
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,866
and me, not so much.

251
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,119
But I relate to you.

252
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,660
I hate being alone.

253
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:57,248
I don't like being left
with my own thoughts,

254
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:58,753
such as they are.

255
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:02,010
I need friends.

256
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,504
One way of making friends

257
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:05,339
is not murdering
everyone you meet.

258
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,675
Yes, you get my dilemma,

259
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:09,055
but you're like me.

260
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,226
Josh said so.

261
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,896
A bad friend and a good friend
at the same time.

262
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,224
- How do you do it?
- I have no choice.

263
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:20,275
You were friends with Eliot.

264
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,398
Very best friends.

265
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,529
Now you can be
friends with me.

266
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:27,445
It'll be the same.

267
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,200
You can show me
how to be more like him.

268
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,452
No.

269
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,250
I love Eliot.

270
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,710
I would do anything for him,
even help you,

271
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:37,709
but you and I,
we won't ever be friends.

272
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,092
Unless you let me talk to him.

273
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,714
Prove he's still alive
in there.

274
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:45,846
I can't do that.

275
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,806
But you could let him go.

276
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,300
You could choose a new body.

277
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,387
But I like this one.

278
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,352
I like the way people
look at me,

279
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,522
and you and your friends

280
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,275
care so deeply
about what happens to it.

281
00:13:02,991 --> 00:13:04,573
Why would I ever leave it?

282
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,417
- Hi.
- I'm here to see Bacchus.

283
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,956
Um...

284
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,083
Yeah, I don't know what
you're talking about. Um...

285
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,289
It's Ember's.

286
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:23,046
"Bacchanal" is the word
you're looking for.

287
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,293
Cut the crap, Shoshana.

288
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:25,907
It's me, Josh,
from the Bed-Stuy party.

289
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,258
Uh, oh, I...

290
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,590
I didn't think you'd
remember me.

291
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:30,924
Well, it's actually,
you know...

292
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,204
It's really good
that you're here,

293
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,845
'cause he's been darker
the last few weeks.

294
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,060
I think a friendly face
could really help.

295
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,353
Great.

296
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,487
Hey, Q?

297
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,438
Oh, my God.

298
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,027
Hey.

299
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,012
Where have you been?
We couldn't find you.

300
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:49,527
"Enrolled at Brakebills,"
she said,

301
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,952
fully aware of the irony.

302
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,496
I just, um...

303
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,237
I don't know
where to start. Uh...

304
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,195
Have you heard
anything about Alice?

305
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:00,881
No.

306
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,376
No, I mean,
not since she completely

307
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,049
screwed us over
at Blackspire, why?

308
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:05,797
Where is everyone else?

309
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,509
If the Library's
going to arrest us on sight,

310
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:12,592
how do we get one of these coins,
much less five?

311
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,769
I asked around,
so there might be another way.

312
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:20,065
The Library's official story
is that the McAllistair family

313
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,642
heroically turned magic
back on.

314
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:25,650
So, they gave them a free pass
to as many coins as they want.

315
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,606
They give them
these special cards

316
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,316
with no limits,
no questions asked.

317
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:30,905
Only a few of them exist,
and hedges

318
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,056
are calling them Black Cards.

319
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,080
We could steal one.

320
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,224
If you steal a credit card,

321
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,285
it only works
until it's reported stolen.

322
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:37,916
With something this valuable,

323
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,146
that's gonna happen
pretty damn quick.

324
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:40,206
Forgery, maybe?

325
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,912
Good enough to fool
the Library?

326
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,290
I used to know a guy,
a master counterfeiter.

327
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,670
The Beast killed him, but...

328
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,300
But that was in your timeline.

329
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,803
I did know Frankie
since before Brakebills,

330
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,801
so hopefully
your Penny did, too.

331
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,887
And hopefully he has
the same number.

332
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,145
Damn it.

333
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:00,810
I still have the DJ's phone.

334
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,172
Well, the good news
is your Penny

335
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:06,256
has the same password as me,

336
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,363
so, I'm downloading
his contacts right now.

337
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,283
Ugh. So many
Insta notifications.

338
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:12,860
Okay, I got his number.
I'll try him.

339
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,121
I can't log in.

340
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,696
It wants to send
a text message

341
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,782
to my old phone to confirm,

342
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:18,915
but if I had my old phone,

343
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,320
why the hell
would I be doing this?

344
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,086
Have you talked
to your dad lately?

345
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,418
I called him
from Brian's phone,

346
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:26,919
but nobody picked up.

347
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,549
Nobody answers their phone

348
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,322
when they don't recognize
the number, right?

349
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,757
You're probably right.

350
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,306
Guys, he picked up.

351
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:38,668
Oh, I don't think
you can park there.

352
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,304
Yeah, I don't think he cares.

353
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,311
Shit just always seems
to work out for Frankie.

354
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:44,975
Another timeline?

355
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,522
That's wild.

356
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,298
- I thought you were dead.
- Likewise.

357
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,002
So, the Frankie I knew
was a counterfeiter.

358
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,323
So am I, but for most jobs,

359
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:53,617
my skills are overkill.

360
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:56,366
Duping objects to fool
regular dopes is simple.

361
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,823
99% of the art you see
in museums is fake,

362
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,407
because, why waste
the real thing

363
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,271
on people who can't tell
the difference anyway?

364
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,706
Fooling magicians, though,

365
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,579
that's where
the special sauce comes in.

366
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,132
So, what's the MacGuffin?

367
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,332
A Library Black Card.

368
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:11,547
That's gonna take
a lot of sauce.

369
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:14,992
You know what?
Let me get that.

370
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:16,223
That's probably for me.

371
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,308
- Congratulations!
- Not now, guys.

372
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,629
You know what?
Actually, I'm gonna grab...

373
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,985
Thank you. Thanks.

374
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,071
Have a good one.

375
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,993
Are you gonna
explain that, or...

376
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,211
- Is it in your size?
- They're always my size.

377
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,911
Anyway, uh...
Library Black Card.

378
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:43,535
That's tricky,
but I can do it.

379
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,043
Yeah, what'll it cost us?

380
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,913
Whatever you're withdrawing
from the Library,

381
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,543
double it.

382
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:51,216
Ten Dewey coins?

383
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,468
That's like "raise an army
of the dead" level magic.

384
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,090
- That is a big ask.
- Yeah.

385
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,468
If my forgery works,
it won't matter.

386
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:59,929
Now, I'm gonna need
some stuff.

387
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,306
I'm gonna need at least two minutes
with a real Black Card

388
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,388
to use as a mold,
two Philly cheese steaks,

389
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:06,098
four liters of cherry soda,

390
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:07,544
not store brand.

391
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,935
- That's a deal breaker.
- I know, I know.

392
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,189
And at least a third
of a Dewey coin to get us started.

393
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,340
You need a battery
to get more batteries?

394
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,484
Yeah. Call it, uh, seed magic.

395
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,658
Oh, uh...

396
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:18,745
We can't exactly

397
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,570
walk into the Library
and just ask for one.

398
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,880
Well, there's a game of Push
happening tonight.

399
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,203
What's Push?

400
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:25,743
It's a card game.

401
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:27,919
High rollers play for Deweys,

402
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,496
but you can buy in for less.

403
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,582
Any of you good at cards?

404
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,664
A magic card game is hard
under normal circumstances,

405
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:42,871
but right now the Library's
only putting out enough magic

406
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,978
for small-scale spells.

407
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,351
I mean,
one big transformation,

408
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,478
and I'm gonna black out
the entire room.

409
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:50,855
Yeah, it's about efficiency.

410
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,777
Some magicians
are semi trucks,

411
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,650
guzzling magic
to do a simple spell.

412
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,231
Some of us are Priuses.

413
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,325
What are you?

414
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,617
A sensible, mid-sized...

415
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:01,384
What was the one that would
always explode?

416
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:02,662
Yeah, that.

417
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,580
Hey, can we back him up?

418
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,456
No, no, not, not me.

419
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:09,999
I can't even make a spark.

420
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,752
Well, I'm persona non grata

421
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:14,708
at Push games
in this city, so...

422
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,008
I just don't want to.

423
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,462
It's a one-on-one game,
anyway, so no backup.

424
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,422
But, uh, good luck.

425
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,718
What do you have
to wager?

426
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,386
It's a protection amulet.

427
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,517
It's sort of all-purpose.

428
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:32,980
It's not good enough.

429
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,688
If you can't buy in,
make room for somebody who can.

430
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,903
Uh, wait, um, he's a Traveler.

431
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,658
I'll wager his exclusive
services for 48 hours.

432
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,034
- A year.
- A month.

433
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,581
- Whoa. Hold on.
- I won't lose.

434
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:47,667
But you're a loser.

435
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,293
A month. No questions asked.

436
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,872
Welcome to the game.

437
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,058
Okay, the rules of Push
are simple.

438
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,144
It's like the game War.

439
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,264
<i>Two players.</i>

440
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:08,641
<i>Each draws a card.</i>

441
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,222
<i>High card wins the hand.</i>

442
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:12,128
<i>When the deck is gone,
the game's over.</i>

443
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,810
But the real art of the game
is knowing how to cheat.

444
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,942
<i>See, a shuffled deck of cards</i>

445
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:23,277
<i>is not a fixed thing.</i>

446
00:19:23,371 --> 00:19:25,237
<i>It's a cloud of possibilities.</i>

447
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,785
<i>And you can change the odds
if you know how.</i>

448
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,432
<i>Put the right card
into your hand,</i>

449
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,635
<i>or the wrong card
into your opponent's.</i>

450
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:03,863
Wait, what is that?

451
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,912
Rules of poker.

452
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,855
<i>You'll have to beat
three opponents</i>

453
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,120
<i>to win the whole thing.</i>

454
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,705
Shall we?

455
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,307
<i>The more probability spells
that you throw around,</i>

456
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:31,011
<i>the more improbable things
can get.</i>

457
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:36,854
Be careful of those.

458
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,276
They killed Bobby Darin.

459
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,987
<i>The final round is when
you play for the Dewey.</i>

460
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,153
Breaking a tie is complicated.

461
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:31,283
Get the hats.

462
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:32,789
<i>You throw cards into a hat,</i>

463
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:35,409
<i>and whichever ones you sink,
you score like a poker hand.</i>

464
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:51,684
Straight flush.

465
00:21:56,524 --> 00:21:58,811
I'm just saying,
what if he loses?

466
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:01,435
I'm a Traveler. I'll grab
the coin and blip away.

467
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,691
Yeah, and then the people
you just robbed

468
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:05,147
hunt you down and torture you.

469
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,858
So, why don't we
save that for plan B?

470
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:12,746
Listen, if you lose
this last hand, it's over.

471
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,908
- I think we need to be ready for plan B.
- No.

472
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,514
What is the point
of this display?

473
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:44,319
You've used up all
the ambient magic in the room.

474
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:53,532
I guess we'll just
have to play an honest game.

475
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,015
- Got it.
- Perfect.

476
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,230
Now the easy part.

477
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:21,227
Borrow a Black Card
to use as a template.

478
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,852
- Anything?
- No.

479
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,697
Why are we going along
with this?

480
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,992
Marina killed my mother.

481
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,410
That was a different Marina.

482
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,866
How different?

483
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:38,574
And we're just gonna hand her
a nuclear bomb?

484
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:40,375
What's the alternative?

485
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,126
We use it against her.

486
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:43,874
Where does that end?

487
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:47,048
I came here to get away
from that kind of shit.

488
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:50,377
You know, I'm getting really
sick of being the voice

489
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:52,713
in the back of the room
that everyone ignores.

490
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,556
The other me, Sam,

491
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,850
did whatever
she thought was right,

492
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,497
regardless of what
anybody else thought.

493
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:00,721
I get it.

494
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:05,188
Because where I came from,
everyone I cared about is dead.

495
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,894
No other voice to listen to
but mine.

496
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:12,319
But maybe Sam didn't care
what anyone else thought

497
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,616
because she's alone.

498
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:15,986
You aren't.

499
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:22,705
Whoa.

500
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,414
I got something here.

501
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:27,205
There's huge energy
coming off her purse.

502
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,541
It's gotta be the Black Card
in there.

503
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:30,885
Showtime.

504
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,089
Oh, excuse me, I'm...

505
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,184
I'm sorry.

506
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:39,509
Do I know you from somewhere?

507
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,228
I mean, I dabbled in acting.

508
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:44,560
What have I seen you in?

509
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,815
Let's just say some provocative films
of the 1970s.

510
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,486
Interesting.

511
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:08,125
All finished.

512
00:25:08,382 --> 00:25:09,714
Great. Let's go.

513
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,587
Uh, there is one little thing.

514
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,002
That special sauce
I was talking about before.

515
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,176
Most forgers use
complicated illusion work.

516
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:19,223
That's not quite my thing.

517
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:32,195
Did a bird just
bring you a sandwich?

518
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,779
Yeah, I guess she did.

519
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:34,907
You want it?

520
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,616
Well, I mean, yeah, but...

521
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,319
But what the fuck, Frankie?

522
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:40,682
This is what
I'm talking about.

523
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,572
Luck is my discipline.

524
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:45,534
The forgeries I make give whoever's
holding them insanely good luck.

525
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,495
So, nobody even bothers
to checkif the thing is fake.

526
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:52,503
I've done the spellwork so many times,
I'm just sort of encrusted with it.

527
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:56,303
Luck is zero-sum, so all that bad luck
has got to go somewhere.

528
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,758
It goes into a bear?

529
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:04,390
Somebody, not me,
has to hold that

530
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,975
while the others bring
the Black Card to the Library.

531
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:10,650
And whoever's holding it
is gonna have a bad day.

532
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,070
- I'll do it.
- No, Jules. You don't have to. He...

533
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:15,156
It's okay.

534
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:20,159
It's hard to explain,
but I'm kind of bulletproof.

535
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:23,530
If anybody should have terrible luck,
it should be me.

536
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:24,749
Why are you bulletproof?

537
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,000
That's none of your business.

538
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:28,669
Pick it up.

539
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,507
No, no, no, no, no, no,
something's wrong.

540
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,242
Uh, whatever "none of my business"
shit is going on with you,

541
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,883
it's interfering with the fortune spell,
so set it down.

542
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:45,594
- Set it down!
- All right.

543
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:47,605
Ahh...

544
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:51,190
Looks like you
just volunteered.

545
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,112
You awake?

546
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:05,413
Nope.

547
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:06,657
It's time.

548
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,203
Anti-magic paint
on a magic lock.

549
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:53,119
Wish I had thought of that before
those book-sniffing bastards ruined Christmas.

550
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:00,252
Which way now?

551
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,756
I don't know.
Something isn't right.

552
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,258
This should continue straight.

553
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:08,267
Well, you made this map
by mind-controlling a cockroach.

554
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,642
Shouldn't we trust our eyes
rather than some shit-eating bug?

555
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,646
No, I think it's an illusion.

556
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:17,352
There's spellwork
on this wall.

557
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:31,665
Or it's a wall.

558
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,216
This is it.

559
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,509
The Books of Everyone.

560
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:51,720
You look for yours,
and I'll go look for my friends'.

561
00:28:53,774 --> 00:28:54,814
I gotta tell you,

562
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:58,147
it is such a relief to take off
that Ember disguise.

563
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,024
So, what have I been missing
down on Earth?

564
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:03,481
It must be bad.
Your chakras are all fucked up.

565
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:04,866
Oh! Yeah.

566
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:08,657
- Uh, we got magic turned back on.
- Hey!

567
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:12,032
And, you know,
one of our friends just betrayed us.

568
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,498
Which is crazy, right?

569
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,125
Like, who would do that?

570
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:19,751
- Yeah.
- I got mind wiped.

571
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:24,176
Yeah, I was living as this other dude
named Isaac for months.

572
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:29,091
Um, that is exactly
kind of close to my situation.

573
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:33,724
So, I'm being hunted
by this douchebag Monster,

574
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:35,976
and, like, I need
a place to crash, right?

575
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,272
That's when I remember,

576
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,692
that squirrelly little
human friend of yours

577
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,940
said that he killed Ember,

578
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,522
and I'm like, "I could
take that guy's place."

579
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,695
Live to fuck another day,
you know?

580
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,492
It's kind of nice, you know?

581
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:52,663
Freeing to live
as someone else for a little bit.

582
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,206
Yeah, I guess.

583
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:57,627
You know, a famous cocksman
once told me,

584
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:02,499
"Once you've had quantity,
the only thing left is strange."

585
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,719
And, boy, is this place
full of strange.

586
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:09,722
I mean,
Isaac's life was great.

587
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:13,722
Lot of friends, big family.

588
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:18,098
But eventually, it all ends,

589
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,682
and your old life,

590
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:22,143
your old problems,

591
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,232
they catch up to you.

592
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:25,359
Or your problems

593
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:27,782
never find you and
the party goes on forever.

594
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:30,736
Oh!
Look at that, I'm dry.

595
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,954
Is that...
Did you make for me?

596
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,161
- Yes.
- Josh special?

597
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:38,660
Uh, yes, I made it for you.

598
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:40,586
You and me, Joshy,

599
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:42,712
we're the same.

600
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:45,167
We're born to be
the perfect hosts.

601
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:49,925
We want everyone around us
to have a good time, we make sure of it.

602
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:52,014
Nobody does the same for us.

603
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:53,467
Mmm-mmm.

604
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,098
This is to Josh, not to Isaac.

605
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:57,474
This is to the real you.

606
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:04,235
I'm sorry.

607
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:07,109
I pee-peed in it,

608
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:09,316
and you don't...
You don't drink that.

609
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,409
So...

610
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:15,913
This is the dumbest plan.

611
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,366
Frankie says
the disguises won't matter.

612
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:21,165
If the Black Card works,
nobody will question them.

613
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:23,254
I feel like an idiot.

614
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,956
Excuse me, sir.

615
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,882
You have a fresh look.

616
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:28,671
Have you considered modeling?

617
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:34,136
Okay, it's just soup.

618
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:38,478
Can't choke, it's not scalding.
It's totally safe.

619
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,818
Ugh! Look at that line.
This is gonna take forever.

620
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,395
I've been thinking,
while we're here,

621
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:48,772
we should get a bit extra.

622
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:52,359
Five for Marina,
five for Frankie, 10 for us.

623
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:55,495
We'd have to be insanely
lucky to get that much.

624
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,788
The more luck we get,

625
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,331
the more bad luck
Quentin gets.

626
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:02,497
When this is over,
the McAllistairs will still be after us.

627
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:07,340
We'll need to do
some major cloaking spell.

628
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:08,958
It could kill him.

629
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:12,841
Hey! There's a truck outside
giving out free ice cream!

630
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:17,891
I mean,
two extra coins can't hurt.

631
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,291
It's all good.
Soup spills all the time.

632
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,227
Thanks.

633
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:25,985
Damn it.

634
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:28,861
How the hell do you get
a paper cut from a paper towel?

635
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:31,238
Welcome. Hi.

636
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:34,530
So, how can I help you today?

637
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:37,866
We need 12 contained
current coins.

638
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,451
- Here.
- No, God.

639
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:44,581
Keep it away.

640
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,457
Everything looks in order.

641
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,717
Just need to check
one little thing.

642
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:01,807
Oh, shoot.

643
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,191
Did you hear something?

644
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:11,195
Where did it come from?

645
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:13,648
Out of the toilet.

646
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,524
All right, then,
I'll send this requisition

647
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,861
to the home office,
and they'll return your coins.

648
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,254
I thought you said
your phone wasn't working.

649
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:37,797
It's a voicemail from my mom.

650
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:39,219
Do you think...

651
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:40,309
Q?

652
00:33:40,769 --> 00:33:42,205
It's got to be about my dad.
I'm not gonna...

653
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:43,310
No, Q, the bear.

654
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:49,100
Okay.

655
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:54,988
Oh.

656
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:59,114
Your request has been flagged
for follow-up with a supervisor.

657
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:00,411
Wait here, please.

658
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,159
A requisition follow-up
for you.

659
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:08,744
Christ, can it wait?

660
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:10,795
Fine.

661
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,313
Sorry, I can't see for shit.

662
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,820
Bloody thing's making me crazy.
Do you mind?

663
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,822
No, do your thing.

664
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,032
- What do I do?
- Just, please, don't listen to it

665
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:43,784
until we hear back
from Penny and Kady.

666
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,333
Oh, shit!

667
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:50,044
Oh, Jesus Christ,
now I've got it in backwards.

668
00:34:53,675 --> 00:34:55,086
About those coins...

669
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,501
Listen,

670
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:59,087
the truth is, the red tape,
the paperwork,

671
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,342
it's, in my mind,
all just a wank.

672
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:02,890
You guys gonna
blow yourselves up?

673
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:04,143
- No.
- No?

674
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:05,603
Great.

675
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:09,021
Request approved.

676
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,065
Sorry about the inconvenience.

677
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,693
Thank you very much.
You have a good day.

678
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:23,327
Jesus, shit!

679
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:25,746
Okay, they did it.
Drop the bear!

680
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,917
It really came out of the...

681
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:32,582
I don't want to talk about it.

682
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:37,176
Thank you, brother.

683
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:41,046
I had a feeling things would work out,
because they always do.

684
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,380
By the way,
I'd destroy those ASAP.

685
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:46,434
They'll be out of juice soon,
but you don't want to take any chances.

686
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:47,931
I'm on it.

687
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,280
You nutsacked out, didn't you?

688
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:08,452
Oh, well, "pussied out"
makes perfect sense here?

689
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,542
Well, if you mean that I
couldn't go through with it,

690
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:13,244
then, yes, you're right.

691
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:17,002
Josh, we don't have
a choice here.

692
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,959
Now, where is the rest
of the ambrosia?

693
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,180
Fine.

694
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:25,368
But just know that Bacchus
will never drink anything you give him.

695
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:27,224
Oh, I'm not gonna give it
to Bacchus.

696
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:28,934
Yeah, I'm gonna dump it
in there.

697
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:30,720
Everyone will drink it.

698
00:36:30,814 --> 00:36:33,272
Are you nuts?
There are over 100 people here.

699
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,099
You have no idea
what that will do to them.

700
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,355
Well, I'm pretty sure
it'll fucking kill them.

701
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:42,441
And I'll do it, unless you start
acting like a real pussy

702
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:45,660
and take one
for the fucking team.

703
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,990
Hey, uh,
I'm sorry about...

704
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:54,289
We've all peed
in things we regret.

705
00:36:56,423 --> 00:37:00,963
I know gods are supposed
to be distant and unknowable,

706
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,634
but you're a good guy.

707
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:07,306
I wanna tell you a secret.

708
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:15,185
What did you put in this?

709
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,527
I found my book. Now let's get
the hell out of here.

710
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,321
I can't find
my friends' books.

711
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,763
"The following books have been removed
from circulation for revisions.

712
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,244
"Q. Coldwater, A. Quinn."

713
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,748
They're filling in
the endings of our books...

714
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:35,486
The pages that were missing
because of the Great Blank Spot.

715
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:45,179
Nick?

716
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:51,176
Hey, I'm sorry about your friends' books,
but this is our chance.

717
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,306
- Come with me.
- I can't.

718
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,224
I can't leave
without their books.

719
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,348
Well, I want to do the...

720
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,650
Look, just go while you still
have the chance, okay?

721
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,776
I can find the Revision Room
on my own.

722
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:07,609
For what it's worth,
you're still on my Nice List.

723
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:29,008
The fuck?

724
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,739
Do you remember me?

725
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:50,697
Because I don't.

726
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:53,829
I don't remember my name

727
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:55,497
or where I came from.

728
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:58,622
But I remember you.

729
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:03,331
You took something from me,
something important,

730
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,087
and then you threw me

731
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,177
in a cage,

732
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:09,549
and I would like

733
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:11,301
for you to explain.

734
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,057
You remember all that,

735
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:18,387
but you don't remember
what you are, what you did.

736
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,059
The word "monster"

737
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,149
has been thrown around.

738
00:39:21,276 --> 00:39:22,733
That's right.

739
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:25,277
We put you
with the rest of your kind.

740
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,105
And I ate them.

741
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,737
You're kind of making my case
for me here.

742
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,951
We have the same parents.

743
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:34,529
Why am I a monster

744
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:35,622
and you're a god?

745
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,749
If you don't want to be
a monster, then let me go.

746
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,454
Give me back what you took

747
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:41,786
from me, and maybe I will.

748
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:46,207
I can't ever.

749
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:48,092
I'm sorry.

750
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:54,265
It was a part of me,
and now it's a part of you,

751
00:39:56,978 --> 00:40:00,187
burning in your body.

752
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,606
Wait. Wait.

753
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:04,691
This world needs me.

754
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,685
Its god is dead.

755
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,566
You don't have to do this.

756
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:11,024
There's others.
There's still time.

757
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,733
We can figure something out.

758
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,443
It doesn't have to be me.

759
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:15,579
It doesn't have to...

760
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,143
What the fuck
did he just rip out of him?

761
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:41,308
Whatever it is,
to a fairy eye,

762
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,684
it's like staring
straight at the sun.

763
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:48,820
They're real.

764
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:52,072
Well, it's been a pleasure.

765
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,901
The trackers on us?

766
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,160
Not actually a thing.

767
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,363
You guys are too lawful good
to bitch out.

768
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,132
Marina.

769
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,126
I've been looking for you.

770
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,888
Excuse me, miss.
These are free to a good home.

771
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:21,059
Are you interested?

772
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:30,106
Hey, are you sure Marina's apartment's
the safest place for us to meet?

773
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:31,945
It's not Marina's.

774
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:34,030
It's mine.

775
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,236
What did you do?

776
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,742
I handled the problem.

777
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:39,282
Now, can we do
this cloaking spell

778
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:41,455
before the McAllistairs
show up and kill all of us?

779
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:47,087
Hey.

780
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,000
You haven't listened?

781
00:41:49,966 --> 00:41:51,878
You know,
your bad luck's gone.

782
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:54,630
Safe as it'll ever be.

783
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:59,636
But that's not
what's really stopping you.

784
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,307
The other me,

785
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:03,603
Brian...

786
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,022
His dad died
when he was a kid.

787
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:10,564
He was too little
to even understand.

788
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:13,604
All of his problems
were like that.

789
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:15,109
No sharp edges.

790
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,199
Yeah.

791
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:18,910
Look at us.

792
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:22,371
We paid a hell
of a fucking price.

793
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:26,287
You gave up being a goddess.

794
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:30,545
I gave up my father.

795
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:37,594
What did we get in return?

796
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:39,839
Magic is back.

797
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,804
Mmm-mmm. Not in
the way that we wanted.

798
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:52,769
How are you not furious?

799
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:57,986
Because,
for almost everyone,

800
00:42:58,076 --> 00:43:01,035
the world is
a little brighter.

801
00:43:01,621 --> 00:43:03,613
Even if they never know why.

802
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,040
I hate the Library
for what they did.

803
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:11,829
But my part in it...
I knew what it cost.

804
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:15,966
And I'd do it again.

805
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,051
But you wouldn't.

806
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:27,766
Will you sit here
for a minute?

807
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:29,314
Yeah.

808
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,317
<i>Hi, Quentin.</i>

809
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:38,363
<i>Sorry to leave a message
with bad news.</i>

810
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:42,492
<i>I need to talk to you
about your father.</i>
