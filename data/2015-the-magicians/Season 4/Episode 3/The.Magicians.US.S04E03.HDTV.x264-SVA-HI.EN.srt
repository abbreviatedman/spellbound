00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:07,090
If the Library's
going to arrest us on sight,

362
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,150
how do we get one of these
coins, much less five?

363
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,190
I asked around,
so there might be another way.

364
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,170
The Library's official story
is that the McAllister family

365
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,160
heroically turned magic back on.

366
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:23,170
So they gave them a free pass
to as many coins as they want.

367
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:25,140
They give them
these special cards

368
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,060
with no limits,
no questions asked.

369
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,100
Only a few of them exist,
and Hedges

370
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,130
are calling them Black Cards.

371
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,170
We could steal one.

372
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,060
If you steal a credit card,

373
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,070
it only works until
it's reported stolen.

374
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,130
With something this valuable,

375
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,300
it's gonna happen
pretty damn quick.

376
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,280
Forgery, maybe?

377
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,260
Good enough to fool the Library?

378
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,330
I used to know a guy,
a master counterfeiter.

379
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,140
The Beast killed him, but...

380
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,070
But that was in your timeline.

381
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,130
I did know Franky
since before Brakebills,

382
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,200
so hopefully your Penny did too.

383
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:53,050
And hopefully
he has the same number.

384
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,080
Damn it.
(laughs)

385
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,300
I still have the DJ's phone.

386
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,310
Well, the good news
is your Penny

387
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,320
has the same password as me,

388
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:06,090
so I'm downloading
his contacts right now.

389
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,070
- Ugh.
- So many Insta notifications.

390
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,270
- Okay, I got his number.
- I'll try him.

391

392
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:13,170
It wants to send a text message

393
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,330
to my old phone to confirm,

394
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:16,090
but if I had my old phone,

395
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,120
why the hell
would I be doing this?

396
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,330

to your dad lately?

397
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,090
I called him from Brian's phone,

398
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,300
but nobody picked up.

399
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,100
Nobody answers their phone

400
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,320
when they don't recognize
the number, right?

401
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,190
You're probably right.

402
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,120
Guys, he picked up.

403
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,180
Oh, I don't think
you can park there.

404
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,170
Yeah, I don't think he cares.

405
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,150
Shit just always seems
to work out for Franky.

406
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,330
Another timeline?

407
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,050
That's wild.

408
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,050
- I thought you were dead.
- Likewise.

409
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,130
So the Franky I knew
was a counterfeiter.

410
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,320
So am I, but for most jobs,

411
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,150
my skills are overkill.

412
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,090
Duping objects to fool
regular dopes is simple.

413
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,150
99% of the art you see
in museums is fake,

414
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,090
because why waste the real thing

415

the difference anyway?

416
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,180
Fooling Magicians, though,

417
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,200
that's where the special sauce
comes in.

418

419

615
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,050
So nobody even bothers to check

616
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,930

617
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,080

while the others bring
the Black Card to the Library.

699
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:57,450

is strange."

And, boy, is this place
full of strange.

701
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:04,440
I mean, Isaac's life was great.

702

big, uh... family.

707
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:19,360
