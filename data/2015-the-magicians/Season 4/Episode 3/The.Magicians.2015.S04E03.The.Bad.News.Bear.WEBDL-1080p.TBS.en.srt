1
00:00:06,484 --> 00:00:08,716
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:08,763 --> 00:00:09,876
Are you Santa Claus?

3
00:00:09,921 --> 00:00:11,479
Oh, I'm not... not that.

4
00:00:11,524 --> 00:00:12,638
Magic's gone.

5
00:00:12,682 --> 00:00:13,973
I'm not a magician,

6
00:00:14,018 --> 00:00:15,621
but I could feel it
when it was gone,

7
00:00:15,665 --> 00:00:17,580
and I knew it wasn't
a coincidence

8
00:00:17,624 --> 00:00:19,628
when I went into remission
a week later.

9
00:00:19,672 --> 00:00:21,097
What timeline are you from?

10
00:00:21,141 --> 00:00:22,566
The one where you
owe me child support.

11
00:00:22,611 --> 00:00:23,902
I'm kidding.

12
00:00:23,946 --> 00:00:25,415
Kay, then if you want me to help

13
00:00:25,461 --> 00:00:27,108
these students, can
you tell me who they are?

14
00:00:27,153 --> 00:00:29,334
Their lives were
in grave danger.

15
00:00:29,379 --> 00:00:31,071
I cast a spell that

16
00:00:31,115 --> 00:00:33,119
erased their identities
and gave them new ones.

17
00:00:33,163 --> 00:00:34,588
I mean, isn't there anything
you can do?

18
00:00:34,632 --> 00:00:36,903
If I reveal that the spell
can be reversed,

19
00:00:36,948 --> 00:00:38,417
then someone would reverse
the spell.

20
00:00:44,651 --> 00:00:46,254
Bacchus,
what are you doing here?

21
00:00:46,298 --> 00:00:47,945
Why do you want everyone
thinking you're Ember?

22
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,326
Thanks for popping in.

23
00:00:50,839 --> 00:00:51,908
Oh, my God.

24
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:53,556
Mis hermanos.

25
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:55,114
Where were you?
We... we looked everywhere...

26
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:56,984
- Stay back.
- Why?

27
00:00:57,029 --> 00:00:58,948
Because I'm not here to play.

28
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:02,875
Marina.

29
00:01:03,834 --> 00:01:06,103
Why do you look like
you're fleeing something?

30
00:01:06,147 --> 00:01:09,157
It's me, Margo,
previously known as Janet.

31
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,425
Look, I'm gonna do you a solid.

32
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:13,606
Don't go up there.
Why?

33
00:01:13,651 --> 00:01:15,962
Because there's an uninvited
guest in my apartment

34
00:01:16,006 --> 00:01:18,143
who's probably killing
your friends right about now.

35
00:01:18,187 --> 00:01:20,674
Look, I don't know what he is,
and I'm assuming it's a "he"

36
00:01:20,717 --> 00:01:23,685
because this is some
toxically masculine behavior,

37
00:01:23,728 --> 00:01:26,825
but he walked through
every ward and shield I had,

38
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:28,527
set off every alarm.

39
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,228
So instead of going inside,

40
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:31,755
I'm gonna get
a breakfast burrito.

41
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:32,802
You wanna join?

42
00:01:32,845 --> 00:01:34,503
We have to help them.

43
00:01:34,548 --> 00:01:36,816
Oh, you're one of those.

44
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:38,997
Fine, you wanna
stick your neck out?

45
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,917
There's something inside
that can help you.

46
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,575
Do tell.

47
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,326
No traveling.

48
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:47,853
Where to start?

49
00:01:47,896 --> 00:01:50,122
Order is important
with these things.

50
00:01:50,165 --> 00:01:53,132
Who goes first?
Who goes last?

51
00:01:53,175 --> 00:01:55,313
Oh, you keep looking at him...

52
00:01:56,185 --> 00:01:58,323
Because you don't
want him to die?

53
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,289
Which means
he has to go before you.

54
00:02:03,428 --> 00:02:06,219
You care about all of them.

55
00:02:06,263 --> 00:02:07,267
So you're last.

56
00:02:11,978 --> 00:02:13,069
Thank Christ.

57
00:02:13,113 --> 00:02:14,334
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

58
00:02:14,378 --> 00:02:16,777
Not... Eliot.

59
00:02:16,821 --> 00:02:19,133
This thing has god-level power,

60
00:02:19,176 --> 00:02:21,794
and I have a bad history
with gods,

61
00:02:21,838 --> 00:02:23,932
since apparently one killed me.

62
00:02:23,976 --> 00:02:25,328
No, it's fine.

63
00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:26,374
Different me, but I didn't want

64
00:02:26,418 --> 00:02:27,815
to get caught off guard again,

65
00:02:27,858 --> 00:02:30,345
so I called in every favor I had

66
00:02:30,388 --> 00:02:32,308
to build a defense system.

67
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:35,056
All you have to do is get him
to sit in the gold chair.

68
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:36,191
Why the gold chair?

69
00:02:36,234 --> 00:02:37,849
Because it had to be something,

70
00:02:37,892 --> 00:02:39,506
and everybody wants to sit
in the gold chair.

71
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,728
It's total power move.

72
00:02:42,473 --> 00:02:43,956
I'm so glad you came.

73
00:02:43,999 --> 00:02:46,399
Saves me
having to hunt you down.

74
00:02:46,442 --> 00:02:49,758
I've got so much of that
ahead of me already.

75
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:51,372
What is he talking about?

76
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:54,339
He's, uh, hunting gods.

77
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:57,960
It's vengeance
for locking you in the castle.

78
00:02:58,004 --> 00:02:59,836
They did more than that,

79
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,105
and so did you.

80
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:04,112
You tried to kill me.

81
00:03:08,517 --> 00:03:11,223
You were all part of it.

82
00:03:14,276 --> 00:03:16,501
Then what?

83
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:18,246
There's a bell on the table.

84
00:03:18,289 --> 00:03:19,380
Ring it.

85
00:03:21,474 --> 00:03:23,089
And he explodes?

86
00:03:23,132 --> 00:03:24,877
He gets a face full
of distilled ambrosia.

87
00:03:24,921 --> 00:03:26,622
It's basically meth for gods.

88
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:28,498
Its gets them high, but an overdose

89
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:29,676
will knock them on their asses.

90
00:03:32,686 --> 00:03:35,217
Tell me Eliot
is still in there somewhere.

91
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,224
Not that I've seen.

92
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:39,405
Your round, innocent face

93
00:03:39,448 --> 00:03:42,371
will make your death
particularly upsetting,

94
00:03:42,415 --> 00:03:44,073
so I've decided
to start with you.

95
00:03:47,388 --> 00:03:49,090
I can give you Bacchus.

96
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:54,412
You're hunting gods,

97
00:03:54,456 --> 00:03:57,466
and I found him hiding
someplace far away.

98
00:03:58,513 --> 00:04:00,694
Hiding from you, right?

99
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,315
I can take you there...

100
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:06,016
if you let them live.

101
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,158
All of them.

102
00:04:14,393 --> 00:04:17,141
Perhaps we can be friends
after all.

103
00:04:32,498 --> 00:04:34,373
So where is everyone else?

104
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:36,599
I don't know.

105
00:04:36,642 --> 00:04:38,605
They were supposed
to remain hidden.

106
00:04:40,787 --> 00:04:42,749
I meant to protect you.

107
00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:47,549
Doesn't really seem
like I need protection.

108
00:04:47,592 --> 00:04:49,424
I mean, nothing
your spell threw at me

109
00:04:49,468 --> 00:04:50,864
even left a scratch.

110
00:04:50,908 --> 00:04:53,395
Reynard did say,
even without their powers,

111
00:04:53,438 --> 00:04:54,747
gods are hard to kill.

112
00:04:56,274 --> 00:05:00,418
I wouldn't underestimate
the will of Irene McAllister.

113
00:05:00,462 --> 00:05:02,687
Huh.

114
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,737
Tell a few people
that you're leaving forever,

115
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:08,271
and look what
the ungrateful bastards do.

116
00:05:08,314 --> 00:05:10,889
Nice.

117
00:05:10,932 --> 00:05:12,634
You know, if the deal is broken

118
00:05:12,677 --> 00:05:13,767
and the McAllisters are coming,

119
00:05:13,811 --> 00:05:15,861
I'm gonna have to warn everyone.

120
00:05:15,906 --> 00:05:19,788
Contacting your friends will
put a target on their backs.

121
00:05:19,832 --> 00:05:21,577
To be clear,

122
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,369
you put the target on our backs.

123
00:05:24,413 --> 00:05:26,463
You betrayed us.

124
00:05:26,507 --> 00:05:28,033
Hmm.

125
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:31,044
I sacrificed everything
to bring back magic.

126
00:05:31,087 --> 00:05:33,967
You know what I sacrificed,

127
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,100
and look what you do with it.

128
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:40,729
Yes, Ms. Wicker,

129
00:05:40,772 --> 00:05:45,702
I made a deal
with the goddamn Library,

130
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:49,061
and in doing so,
I saved your lives.

131
00:05:49,105 --> 00:05:51,112
Yeah, well, you're pretty
fucking quick to compromise,

132
00:05:51,155 --> 00:05:52,508
you know that?

133
00:05:53,903 --> 00:05:57,045
Now, I need to find my friends,
but I can't do magic,

134
00:05:57,088 --> 00:05:59,924
so you're going to cast
the locator spell for me.

135
00:06:21,169 --> 00:06:23,002
Dean Fogg. Finally.

136
00:06:23,046 --> 00:06:24,791
I only have a moment.

137
00:06:26,711 --> 00:06:28,063
You know how the Library

138
00:06:28,106 --> 00:06:31,640
contains the books of everyone
who ever lived?

139
00:06:31,684 --> 00:06:32,818
Yeah.

140
00:06:32,861 --> 00:06:35,741
The Great Blank Spot is over.

141
00:06:35,784 --> 00:06:38,010
The Library can update
their books again.

142
00:06:39,711 --> 00:06:43,550
So, if your friends were to get
their memories back,

143
00:06:43,594 --> 00:06:44,815
the Library would know.

144
00:06:44,859 --> 00:06:46,866
They'd try to find them

145
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:49,177
to keep them safe

146
00:06:49,221 --> 00:06:52,886
from the monster
that you warned us about.

147
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:55,940
You're telling me they have
books that describe

148
00:06:55,984 --> 00:06:59,648
every damn thing everyone does
or ever will do,

149
00:06:59,692 --> 00:07:01,655
when you're sleeping,
when you're awake,

150
00:07:01,698 --> 00:07:03,225
naughty or nice?

151
00:07:03,269 --> 00:07:05,363
You know how much time
that would have saved me?

152
00:07:05,406 --> 00:07:07,763
Can we please not
with the Santa stuff right now?

153
00:07:07,806 --> 00:07:10,249
Well, could you please not
with the angsty, nerdy stuff?

154
00:07:10,293 --> 00:07:12,343
Huh?
No, 'cause that's who you are,

155
00:07:12,387 --> 00:07:14,001
and I don't judge you for it.

156
00:07:14,045 --> 00:07:15,964
Dean Fogg was trying
to give me a message.

157
00:07:16,008 --> 00:07:18,843
Look, if we escape,
they'll just read our books,

158
00:07:18,887 --> 00:07:20,457
find out where we are,
and come after us.

159
00:07:20,501 --> 00:07:22,857
So we just take the books
with us,

160
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,213
or, uh... or destroy 'em.

161
00:07:25,257 --> 00:07:27,307
But first we have
to actually escape.

162
00:07:29,401 --> 00:07:31,058
I can get us to the fireplace.

163
00:07:32,761 --> 00:07:33,894
Just be ready.

164
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,515
All I'm offering is a location.

165
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:38,868
The rest is on you.

166
00:07:38,911 --> 00:07:41,049
Knowing where Bacchus is

167
00:07:41,092 --> 00:07:42,838
doesn't help me if he runs away,

168
00:07:42,882 --> 00:07:45,280
which he'll do
the second I show up.

169
00:07:45,325 --> 00:07:46,938
You see my problem,

170
00:07:46,983 --> 00:07:50,036
and how maybe it is just
easier to kill you all.

171
00:07:57,191 --> 00:07:58,979
Do you know what this is?

172
00:08:08,141 --> 00:08:09,406
Where did you get that?

173
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:11,849
I didn't,

174
00:08:11,893 --> 00:08:14,205
but I know that enough of it
will mess up a god long enough

175
00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:16,211
for you to do
whatever you need to do.

176
00:08:16,255 --> 00:08:17,389
Excuse me, Margo?

177
00:08:18,262 --> 00:08:19,353
Quick talk?

178
00:08:24,195 --> 00:08:27,380
Could you stop volunteering?

179
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,430
I know Bacchus.
He's a friend.

180
00:08:29,474 --> 00:08:31,394
Great.

181
00:08:31,437 --> 00:08:33,400
Then you'll poison him.

182
00:08:33,444 --> 00:08:35,320
He'll never suspect a friend.

183
00:08:40,163 --> 00:08:41,951
I could always kill you.

184
00:08:41,995 --> 00:08:43,347
Awesome.

185
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,612
Great choices.

186
00:08:44,655 --> 00:08:46,619
Well, let's get going, then.

187
00:08:46,662 --> 00:08:49,019
Guys, in case it even
needs to be said,

188
00:08:49,062 --> 00:08:50,109
I know Marina.

189
00:08:50,152 --> 00:08:51,462
She is not a helpful person.

190
00:08:51,505 --> 00:08:53,424
So just act accordingly.

191
00:08:58,573 --> 00:09:00,361
Of course I'm getting paid.

192
00:09:00,405 --> 00:09:02,237
The McAllisters
have a bounty on your heads,

193
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,458
dead or alive.

194
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:05,029
The real yous,

195
00:09:05,073 --> 00:09:06,513
not the witness-protection
identities.

196
00:09:06,556 --> 00:09:08,214
So you can see how
it'd be profitable for me

197
00:09:08,258 --> 00:09:09,610
to get you back to normal.

198
00:09:09,653 --> 00:09:10,788
What are they offering?

199
00:09:12,663 --> 00:09:14,757
- Three Deweys.
- What the hell's a Dewey?

200
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:16,372
As in Melvil Dewey,

201
00:09:16,415 --> 00:09:18,073
the most famous librarian
of all time.

202
00:09:18,117 --> 00:09:19,513
He has his own decimal system.

203
00:09:19,557 --> 00:09:20,778
Well, I think
you're being generous

204
00:09:20,822 --> 00:09:22,174
with the word "famous."

205
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,191
Okay, so in the new world order,

206
00:09:27,235 --> 00:09:28,718
there's just enough
magic in the air

207
00:09:28,762 --> 00:09:31,205
to keep the boring masses
fat and happy,

208
00:09:31,249 --> 00:09:33,255
but you got an itch
to do something bigger,

209
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:35,654
you have to file a request
with the Library.

210
00:09:35,698 --> 00:09:37,661
They decide if you're
trustworthy, and they give you

211
00:09:37,705 --> 00:09:39,581
a cute little battery
in the shape of a coin.

212
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,849
They put the faces of famous
librarians on there,

213
00:09:41,893 --> 00:09:44,467
but Dewey's the only one
people can remember.

214
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:48,524
Well, and Laura Bush,
but Bushes just never stuck.

215
00:09:48,568 --> 00:09:50,531
All right, well,
we'll pay the bounty ourselves.

216
00:09:51,491 --> 00:09:52,712
How are you gonna get Dewey's?

217
00:09:52,756 --> 00:09:54,240
I don't know.
We'll figure it out.

218
00:09:54,283 --> 00:09:55,722
We always...
Sometimes.

219
00:09:55,766 --> 00:09:58,296
Most of the time we do.

220
00:10:01,743 --> 00:10:04,535
Five Deweys
to make it worth the delay,

221
00:10:04,578 --> 00:10:06,672
and know that I have trackers
on all of you,

222
00:10:06,716 --> 00:10:09,944
so if you try to run,
it won't go your way.

223
00:10:15,441 --> 00:10:16,794
Don't drink all my beer.

224
00:10:26,217 --> 00:10:27,788
Seems like this is the place.

225
00:10:27,831 --> 00:10:29,140
It is.

226
00:10:29,183 --> 00:10:31,932
Those are maenads,
Bacchus followers.

227
00:10:31,976 --> 00:10:33,241
Get to it, then.

228
00:10:34,724 --> 00:10:39,000
Oh, and if they have pizza,
bring me some.

229
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:45,936
We can still find a way out.

230
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,114
We already did.
This is it.

231
00:10:47,157 --> 00:10:48,859
We're doing it right now.

232
00:10:48,902 --> 00:10:50,343
You had a weapon that
could have stopped him,

233
00:10:50,386 --> 00:10:52,261
and instead of using it,
you gave it to him.

234
00:10:52,305 --> 00:10:53,396
We tried that already

235
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,054
with Julia's god-killing bullet.

236
00:10:55,097 --> 00:10:56,406
All it did was kill
the monster's host,

237
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,933
which in this case is Eliot.

238
00:10:57,977 --> 00:11:00,420
Who, for all we know, is dead.

239
00:11:03,211 --> 00:11:05,001
Or he's trapped in there,

240
00:11:05,044 --> 00:11:06,789
forced to watch everything
the monster does,

241
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,102
just waiting for us
to find a way to help him.

242
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,508
What are you gonna
slip the ambrosia into?

243
00:11:15,558 --> 00:11:19,135
I guess I'll make a Fillorian
version of his favorite drink.

244
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:22,014
Margarita, but instead of
salt on the rim, it will be...

245
00:11:22,058 --> 00:11:23,891
God meth. Perfect.

246
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:27,163
Now go poison his ass so we can
get out of this malarial swamp.

247
00:11:27,206 --> 00:11:28,472
You know what's incredible?

248
00:11:28,515 --> 00:11:30,216
How you can be
such a good friend

249
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,267
and such a terrible friend
at the exact same time.

250
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:41,166
There's not a lot

251
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,915
that I can relate to
in this world.

252
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:47,579
People here are...

253
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:51,593
well, people, generally,

254
00:11:51,637 --> 00:11:54,429
and me, not so much.

255
00:11:54,472 --> 00:11:56,261
But I relate to you.

256
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:00,711
I hate being alone.

257
00:12:00,755 --> 00:12:03,940
I don't like being left
with my own thoughts,

258
00:12:03,983 --> 00:12:05,641
such as they are.

259
00:12:07,692 --> 00:12:09,174
I need friends.

260
00:12:09,218 --> 00:12:10,483
One way of making friends

261
00:12:10,526 --> 00:12:12,490
is not murdering
everyone you meet.

262
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:14,715
Yes, you get my dilemma,

263
00:12:14,758 --> 00:12:15,762
but you're like me.

264
00:12:15,806 --> 00:12:17,507
Josh said so.

265
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:20,168
A bad friend and a good friend
at the same time.

266
00:12:20,211 --> 00:12:21,172
How do you do it?

267
00:12:21,215 --> 00:12:22,567
I have no choice.

268
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:27,628
You were friends with Eliot.

269
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:31,162
Very best friends.

270
00:12:31,206 --> 00:12:32,732
Now you can be friends with me.

271
00:12:32,776 --> 00:12:34,390
It'll be the same.

272
00:12:34,433 --> 00:12:36,440
You can show me
how to be more like him.

273
00:12:36,484 --> 00:12:38,753
No.

274
00:12:38,797 --> 00:12:40,585
I love Eliot.

275
00:12:40,628 --> 00:12:42,723
I would do anything for him,
even help you,

276
00:12:42,766 --> 00:12:45,122
but you and I,
we won't ever be friends...

277
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:49,180
Unless you let me talk to him.

278
00:12:49,223 --> 00:12:51,535
Prove he's still alive in there.

279
00:12:51,578 --> 00:12:53,193
I can't do that.

280
00:12:53,236 --> 00:12:55,592
But you could let him go.

281
00:12:55,636 --> 00:12:58,428
You could choose a new body.

282
00:12:58,472 --> 00:12:59,781
But I like this one.

283
00:13:01,438 --> 00:13:04,143
I like the way
people look at me,

284
00:13:04,187 --> 00:13:06,761
and you and your friends

285
00:13:06,805 --> 00:13:09,552
care so deeply
about what happens to it.

286
00:13:09,596 --> 00:13:11,952
Why would I ever leave it?

287
00:13:20,023 --> 00:13:21,593
Hi.

288
00:13:21,637 --> 00:13:23,295
I'm here to see Bacchus.

289
00:13:23,338 --> 00:13:25,607
Um, yeah... I don't know
what you're talking about.

290
00:13:25,651 --> 00:13:27,614
Um, it's... it's Ember, s...

291
00:13:27,658 --> 00:13:30,406
"Bacchanal" is the word
you're looking for.

292
00:13:30,449 --> 00:13:31,758
Cut the crap, Shoshana.

293
00:13:31,802 --> 00:13:32,936
It's me, Josh,
from the Bedsty party.

294
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,681
Come on.
Oh, I-

295
00:13:34,725 --> 00:13:35,772
I didn't think
you'd remember me.

296
00:13:36,863 --> 00:13:37,953
Well, it's actually... you know,

297
00:13:37,997 --> 00:13:39,524
it's really good
that you're here,

298
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:42,621
'cause he's been darker
the last few weeks.

299
00:13:42,664 --> 00:13:44,454
I think a friendly face
could really help.

300
00:13:44,497 --> 00:13:45,849
Great.

301
00:13:48,685 --> 00:13:49,820
Hey, Q?

302
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:51,782
- Oh, my...
- Oh, my God.

303
00:13:51,826 --> 00:13:53,746
Hey.

304
00:13:53,789 --> 00:13:55,404
Where have you been?
We couldn't find you.

305
00:13:55,447 --> 00:13:56,799
"Enrolled at Brakebills,"
she said,

306
00:13:56,843 --> 00:13:58,414
fully aware of the irony.

307
00:13:58,457 --> 00:14:00,683
I just, um...

308
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,736
I don't know where to start.
Uh...

309
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:06,616
Have you heard
anything about Alice?

310
00:14:06,659 --> 00:14:08,055
No.

311
00:14:08,099 --> 00:14:09,800
No, I mean, not since
she completely

312
00:14:09,843 --> 00:14:11,546
screwed us over
at Blackspire, why?

313
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:13,029
Where is everyone else?

314
00:14:14,207 --> 00:14:16,911
If the Library's
going to arrest us on sight,

315
00:14:16,954 --> 00:14:20,009
how do we get one of these
coins, much less five?

316
00:14:20,053 --> 00:14:23,150
I asked around,
so there might be another way.

317
00:14:23,193 --> 00:14:27,120
The Library's official story
is that the McAllister family

318
00:14:27,164 --> 00:14:29,083
heroically turned magic back on.

319
00:14:29,127 --> 00:14:33,097
So they gave them a free pass
to as many coins as they want.

320
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,016
They give them
these special cards

321
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,805
with no limits,
no questions asked.

322
00:14:36,848 --> 00:14:37,983
Only a few of them exist,
and Hedges

323
00:14:38,026 --> 00:14:38,986
are calling them Black Cards.

324
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:40,121
We could steal one.

325
00:14:40,164 --> 00:14:41,778
If you steal a credit card,

326
00:14:41,822 --> 00:14:43,829
it only works until
it's reported stolen.

327
00:14:43,872 --> 00:14:45,006
With something this valuable,

328
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,664
it's gonna happen
pretty damn quick.

329
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:47,929
Forgery, maybe?

330
00:14:47,973 --> 00:14:49,500
Good enough to fool the Library?

331
00:14:49,543 --> 00:14:51,812
I used to know a guy,
a master counterfeiter.

332
00:14:51,856 --> 00:14:53,077
The Beast killed him, but...

333
00:14:53,121 --> 00:14:54,866
But that was in your timeline.

334
00:14:54,909 --> 00:14:57,047
I did know Franky
since before Brakebills,

335
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,273
so hopefully your Penny did too.

336
00:14:59,316 --> 00:15:02,762
And hopefully
he has the same number.

337
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:06,907
Damn it.

338
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,608
I still have the DJ's phone.

339
00:15:11,313 --> 00:15:12,753
Well, the good news
is your Penny

340
00:15:12,796 --> 00:15:14,105
has the same password as me,

341
00:15:14,148 --> 00:15:15,980
so I'm downloading
his contacts right now.

342
00:15:16,025 --> 00:15:18,903
Ugh.
So many Insta notifications.

343
00:15:18,948 --> 00:15:20,606
Okay, I got his number.
I'll try him.

344
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:22,045
I can't log in.

345
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,267
It wants to send a text message

346
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,794
to my old phone to confirm,

347
00:15:24,837 --> 00:15:26,014
but if I had my old phone,

348
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:28,065
why the hell
would I be doing this?

349
00:15:29,287 --> 00:15:30,814
Have you talked
to your dad lately?

350
00:15:30,857 --> 00:15:33,038
I called him from Brian's phone,

351
00:15:33,082 --> 00:15:34,740
but nobody picked up.

352
00:15:34,783 --> 00:15:36,093
Nobody answers their phone

353
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:37,751
when they don't recognize
the number, right?

354
00:15:37,794 --> 00:15:39,364
You're probably right.

355
00:15:39,408 --> 00:15:41,065
Guys, he picked up.

356
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,345
Oh, I don't think
you can park there.

357
00:15:46,388 --> 00:15:48,395
Yeah, I don't think he cares.

358
00:15:48,439 --> 00:15:51,231
Shit just always seems
to work out for Franky.

359
00:15:51,274 --> 00:15:52,845
Another timeline?

360
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:54,197
That's wild.

361
00:15:54,241 --> 00:15:55,942
I thought you were dead.
Likewise.

362
00:15:55,986 --> 00:15:57,513
So the Franky I knew
was a counterfeiter.

363
00:15:57,557 --> 00:15:59,825
So am I, but for most jobs,

364
00:15:59,868 --> 00:16:01,265
my skills are overkill.

365
00:16:01,308 --> 00:16:04,100
Duping objects to fool
regular dopes is simple.

366
00:16:04,144 --> 00:16:06,282
99% of the art you see
in museums is fake,

367
00:16:06,325 --> 00:16:08,114
because why waste the real thing

368
00:16:08,157 --> 00:16:09,859
on people who can't tell
the difference anyway?

369
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:11,386
Fooling Magicians, though,

370
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,480
that's where the special sauce
comes in.

371
00:16:13,524 --> 00:16:14,919
So what's the MacGuffin?

372
00:16:14,963 --> 00:16:16,228
A Library Black Card.

373
00:16:18,017 --> 00:16:19,806
That's gonna take
a lot of sauce.

374
00:16:21,464 --> 00:16:22,555
You know what?
Let me get that.

375
00:16:22,598 --> 00:16:23,863
That's probably for me.

376
00:16:28,531 --> 00:16:30,232
- Congratulations...
- Not now, guys.

377
00:16:33,155 --> 00:16:34,158
You know what?

378
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:35,162
Actually, I'm gonna grab...

379
00:16:35,206 --> 00:16:36,384
Thank you. Thanks.

380
00:16:36,427 --> 00:16:37,474
Have a good one.

381
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,978
Are you gonna explain that,
or...

382
00:16:45,021 --> 00:16:46,985
- Are they even your size?
- They're always my size.

383
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,908
Anyway, uh, Library Black Card.

384
00:16:49,951 --> 00:16:51,260
That's tricky, but I can do it.

385
00:16:51,303 --> 00:16:53,354
Yeah, what'll it cost us?

386
00:16:53,397 --> 00:16:55,623
Whatever you're withdrawing
from the Library,

387
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:57,368
double it.

388
00:16:57,411 --> 00:16:59,243
Ten Dewey coins?

389
00:16:59,287 --> 00:17:01,337
That's like "raise an army
of the dead" level magic.

390
00:17:01,381 --> 00:17:02,952
That is a big ask.
Yeah.

391
00:17:02,995 --> 00:17:05,525
If my forgery works,
it won't matter.

392
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:07,663
Now, I'm gonna need some stuff.

393
00:17:07,707 --> 00:17:09,757
I'm gonna need at least two
minutes with a real Black Card

394
00:17:09,801 --> 00:17:12,287
to use as a mold,
two Philly cheesesteaks,

395
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:15,559
four liters of cherry soda,
not store brand...

396
00:17:15,603 --> 00:17:17,523
that's a deal breaker.
I know. I know.

397
00:17:17,566 --> 00:17:18,701
And at least a third
of a Dewey coin

398
00:17:18,745 --> 00:17:20,184
to get us started.

399
00:17:20,227 --> 00:17:22,191
You need a battery
to get more batteries?

400
00:17:22,234 --> 00:17:24,415
Yeah.
Call it, uh, seed magic.

401
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:26,554
Oh, uh...
we can't exactly

402
00:17:26,597 --> 00:17:28,692
walk into the Library
and just ask for one.

403
00:17:28,735 --> 00:17:31,090
Well, there's a game of Push
happening tonight.

404
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:32,181
What's Push?

405
00:17:32,225 --> 00:17:33,664
It's a card game.

406
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:35,584
High rollers play for Deweys,

407
00:17:35,627 --> 00:17:37,460
but you can buy in for less.

408
00:17:37,504 --> 00:17:39,510
Any of you good at cards?

409
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,497
A Magic card game is hard
under normal circumstances,

410
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:49,632
but right now the Library's

411
00:17:49,675 --> 00:17:50,635
only putting out enough magic

412
00:17:50,678 --> 00:17:51,987
for small-scale spells.

413
00:17:52,031 --> 00:17:54,649
I mean, one big transformation,

414
00:17:54,692 --> 00:17:56,830
and I'm gonna black out
the entire room.

415
00:17:56,874 --> 00:17:58,139
Yeah, it's about efficiency.

416
00:17:58,182 --> 00:17:59,927
Some Magicians are semi trucks,

417
00:17:59,971 --> 00:18:01,760
guzzling magic
to do a simple spell.

418
00:18:01,804 --> 00:18:03,635
Some of us are Priuses.

419
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,250
What are you?

420
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:06,951
A sensible, mid-sized...

421
00:18:06,995 --> 00:18:08,783
What was the one that would
always explode?

422
00:18:08,828 --> 00:18:10,048
Yeah, that.

423
00:18:10,093 --> 00:18:12,012
Hey, can we back him up?

424
00:18:13,888 --> 00:18:15,939
No, no, not... not me.

425
00:18:15,982 --> 00:18:17,334
I can't even make a spark.

426
00:18:17,378 --> 00:18:19,908
I'm... well, I'm...
kind of persona non grata

427
00:18:19,952 --> 00:18:22,089
at Push games
in this city, so...

428
00:18:22,133 --> 00:18:23,311
I just don't want to.

429
00:18:23,354 --> 00:18:24,794
It's a one-on-one game, anyway,

430
00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:25,928
so no backup.

431
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:28,066
But, uh, good luck.

432
00:18:29,723 --> 00:18:31,294
What do you have to wager?

433
00:18:31,338 --> 00:18:33,956
It's a protection amulet.

434
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,003
It's sort of all-purpose.

435
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,805
It's not good enough.

436
00:18:40,848 --> 00:18:43,422
If you can't buy in,
make room for somebody who can.

437
00:18:44,382 --> 00:18:46,345
Uh, wait.
Um, he's a Traveler.

438
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,145
I'll wager his exclusive
services for 48 hours.

439
00:18:51,188 --> 00:18:52,497
- A year.
- A month

440
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,024
- Whoa, hold on.
- I won't lose.

441
00:18:54,068 --> 00:18:56,030
But you're a loser.

442
00:18:56,074 --> 00:18:57,950
A month.
No questions asked.

443
00:18:59,215 --> 00:19:01,309
Welcome to the game.

444
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:12,478
Kay, the rules of Push
are simple.

445
00:19:12,521 --> 00:19:13,524
It's like the game War.

446
00:19:13,568 --> 00:19:14,789
Two players.

447
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:16,011
Each draws a card.

448
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:17,974
High card wins the hand.

449
00:19:18,018 --> 00:19:19,850
When the deck is gone,
the game's over.

450
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:22,293
But the real art of the game
is knowing how to cheat.

451
00:19:27,484 --> 00:19:29,448
See, a... a shuffled deck of cards

452
00:19:29,491 --> 00:19:31,062
is not a fixed thing.

453
00:19:31,106 --> 00:19:32,894
It's a cloud of possibilities...

454
00:19:37,257 --> 00:19:39,569
And you can change the odds
if you know how.

455
00:19:50,737 --> 00:19:53,137
Put the right card
into your hand,

456
00:19:53,181 --> 00:19:55,405
or the wrong card
into your opponents.

457
00:20:10,326 --> 00:20:11,285
Wait, what is that?

458
00:20:14,034 --> 00:20:15,299
Rules of Poker.

459
00:20:19,531 --> 00:20:21,232
You'll have to beat
three opponents

460
00:20:21,276 --> 00:20:22,541
to win the whole thing.

461
00:20:22,584 --> 00:20:24,417
Shall we?

462
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:35,541
The more probability spells
that you throw around,

463
00:20:35,585 --> 00:20:38,726
the more improbable
things can get.

464
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:44,572
Be careful of those.

465
00:20:44,616 --> 00:20:46,098
They killed Bobby Darin.

466
00:20:49,807 --> 00:20:53,428
The final round is when
you play for the Dewey.

467
00:21:36,051 --> 00:21:37,926
Breaking a tie is complicated.

468
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,366
Get the hats.

469
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,111
You throw cards into a hat,

470
00:21:41,155 --> 00:21:43,511
and whichever you sink,
you score like a poker hand.

471
00:21:58,562 --> 00:21:59,652
Straight flush.

472
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:06,676
I'm just saying,
what if he loses?

473
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,898
I'm a Traveler.

474
00:22:07,941 --> 00:22:09,599
I'll grab the coin
and blip away.

475
00:22:09,643 --> 00:22:11,693
Yeah, and then the people
you just robbed

476
00:22:11,737 --> 00:22:13,657
hunt you down and torture you.

477
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,794
So why don't we save that
for plan B?

478
00:22:17,233 --> 00:22:19,894
Listen, if you lose
this last hand,

479
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:20,898
it's over.

480
00:22:20,942 --> 00:22:21,901
I think we need

481
00:22:21,945 --> 00:22:22,905
to be ready for plan B.

482
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,759
What is the point
of this display?

483
00:22:49,691 --> 00:22:52,571
You've used up all
the ambient magic in the room.

484
00:22:58,897 --> 00:23:02,037
I guess we'll just
have to play an honest game.

485
00:23:24,854 --> 00:23:25,944
Got it.
Perfect.

486
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,428
Now the easy part.

487
00:23:27,471 --> 00:23:29,391
Borrow a Black Card
to use as a template.

488
00:23:32,009 --> 00:23:34,059
- Anything?
- No.

489
00:23:36,327 --> 00:23:37,942
Why are we going along
with this?

490
00:23:39,381 --> 00:23:41,127
Marina killed my mother.

491
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,479
That was a different Marina.

492
00:23:42,522 --> 00:23:44,790
How different?

493
00:23:44,834 --> 00:23:46,973
Are we just gonna
hand her a nuclear bomb?

494
00:23:47,016 --> 00:23:48,455
What's the alternative?

495
00:23:48,499 --> 00:23:50,506
We use it against her.

496
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:53,036
Where does that end?

497
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,835
I'm... I came here to get away
from that kind of shit.

498
00:23:55,879 --> 00:23:57,934
You know,
I'm getting really sick

499
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,465
of being the voice
in the back of the room

500
00:23:59,508 --> 00:24:01,957
that everyone ignores.

501
00:24:02,001 --> 00:24:04,101
The other me, Sam,

502
00:24:04,145 --> 00:24:06,112
did whatever
she thought was right,

503
00:24:06,157 --> 00:24:07,905
regardless of what
anybody else thought.

504
00:24:07,949 --> 00:24:10,398
I get it...

505
00:24:10,442 --> 00:24:13,635
because where I came from,
everyone I cared about is dead.

506
00:24:14,466 --> 00:24:16,259
No other voice
to listen to but mine.

507
00:24:17,439 --> 00:24:20,457
But maybe Sam didn't care
what anyone else thought

508
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:21,638
because she was alone.

509
00:24:23,081 --> 00:24:24,480
You aren't.

510
00:24:30,122 --> 00:24:31,259
Whoa.

511
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,009
I got something here.

512
00:24:33,052 --> 00:24:36,289
There's huge energy
coming off her purse.

513
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:38,169
It's gotta be the Black Card
in there.

514
00:24:38,213 --> 00:24:39,219
Showtime.

515
00:24:43,198 --> 00:24:44,555
Oh, excuse me, I'm...

516
00:24:45,516 --> 00:24:46,610
I'm... I'm sorry.

517
00:24:46,654 --> 00:24:48,053
Do I know you from somewhere?

518
00:24:48,097 --> 00:24:50,721
I mean, I dabbled in acting.

519
00:24:50,765 --> 00:24:53,126
What have I seen you in?

520
00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:57,325
Let's just say some
provocative films of the 1970s.

521
00:24:57,369 --> 00:24:59,205
Interesting.

522
00:25:15,605 --> 00:25:16,698
All finished.

523
00:25:16,743 --> 00:25:18,404
Great.
Let's go.

524
00:25:18,448 --> 00:25:20,416
Uh, there is one little thing.

525
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,821
That special sauce
I was talking about before.

526
00:25:22,865 --> 00:25:25,708
Most forgers use
complicated illusion work.

527
00:25:25,751 --> 00:25:27,938
That's not quite my thing.

528
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,840
Did a bird just bring you
a sandwich?

529
00:25:40,884 --> 00:25:42,676
Yeah, I guess she did.

530
00:25:42,721 --> 00:25:44,164
You want it?

531
00:25:44,207 --> 00:25:46,481
Well, I mean, yeah, but...

532
00:25:46,525 --> 00:25:48,012
But what the fuck, Franky?

533
00:25:48,055 --> 00:25:49,455
This is what I'm talking about.

534
00:25:49,498 --> 00:25:51,423
Luck is my discipline.

535
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:52,997
The forgeries I make
give whoever's holding them

536
00:25:53,042 --> 00:25:54,528
insanely good luck.

537
00:25:54,572 --> 00:25:55,840
So nobody even bothers to check

538
00:25:55,884 --> 00:25:57,502
if the thing is fake.

539
00:25:57,545 --> 00:25:58,945
I've done the spellwork
so many times,

540
00:25:58,989 --> 00:26:01,219
I'm just sort of encrusted
with it.

541
00:26:01,264 --> 00:26:03,931
Luck is zero-sum,
so all that bad luck

542
00:26:03,975 --> 00:26:05,549
has got to go somewhere.

543
00:26:09,136 --> 00:26:10,709
It goes into a bear?

544
00:26:10,753 --> 00:26:13,815
Somebody, not me,
has to hold that

545
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:16,045
while the others bring
the Black Card to the Library.

546
00:26:16,089 --> 00:26:19,851
And whoever's holding it
is gonna have a bad day.

547
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:22,168
- I'll do it.
- No, Jules.

548
00:26:22,212 --> 00:26:24,136
You don't have to. He...
It's-it's okay.

549
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,296
It's hard to explain,
but I'm kind of bulletproof.

550
00:26:29,341 --> 00:26:31,177
If anybody should have
terrible luck,

551
00:26:31,221 --> 00:26:32,708
it should be me.

552
00:26:32,751 --> 00:26:33,844
Why are you bulletproof?

553
00:26:33,889 --> 00:26:36,163
That's none of your business.

554
00:26:36,207 --> 00:26:37,825
Pick it up.

555
00:26:45,041 --> 00:26:47,752
No, no, no, no, no, no,
something's wrong.

556
00:26:47,796 --> 00:26:49,546
Uh, whatever
"none of my business" shit

557
00:26:49,589 --> 00:26:51,076
is going on with you,
it's interfering

558
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,350
with the fortune spell,
so set it down.

559
00:26:53,394 --> 00:26:55,406
Set it down!
All right.

560
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:56,587
Dahh...

561
00:26:58,467 --> 00:27:00,479
Looks like you just volunteered.

562
00:27:11,193 --> 00:27:12,331
You awake?

563
00:27:12,374 --> 00:27:13,555
Nope.

564
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:15,567
It's time.

565
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,770
Anti-magic paint
on a magic lock.

566
00:27:57,813 --> 00:27:59,344
Wish I had thought of that
before those

567
00:27:59,388 --> 00:28:01,531
book-sniffing bastards
ruined Christmas.

568
00:28:01,575 --> 00:28:02,843
Shh.

569
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:08,878
Which way now?

570
00:28:08,922 --> 00:28:10,365
I don't know.
Something isn't right.

571
00:28:10,408 --> 00:28:12,290
This should continue straight.

572
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:14,783
Well, you made this map

573
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,575
by mind-controlling a cockroach.

574
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,844
Shouldn't we trust our eyes

575
00:28:17,888 --> 00:28:20,337
rather than some
shit-eating bug?

576
00:28:22,523 --> 00:28:24,360
No, I think it's an illusion.

577
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:26,022
There's spellwork on this wall.

578
00:28:39,054 --> 00:28:40,454
Or it's a wall.

579
00:28:55,849 --> 00:28:58,123
This is it.
The books of everyone.

580
00:28:58,166 --> 00:29:00,572
You look for yours, and I'll
go look for my friends'.

581
00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:04,857
I gotta tell you,
it is such a relief

582
00:29:04,902 --> 00:29:07,044
to take off that Ember disguise.

583
00:29:07,088 --> 00:29:08,749
So what have I been missing
down on Earth?

584
00:29:08,793 --> 00:29:09,887
It must be bad.

585
00:29:09,931 --> 00:29:12,161
Your chakras are all fucked up.

586
00:29:12,205 --> 00:29:13,823
Oh, yeah.

587
00:29:13,867 --> 00:29:16,272
Uh, we got magic turned back on.

588
00:29:16,316 --> 00:29:17,322
Hey.

589
00:29:17,365 --> 00:29:18,808
And, you know,

590
00:29:18,852 --> 00:29:21,170
one of our friends
just betrayed us...

591
00:29:22,002 --> 00:29:24,231
Which is crazy, right?

592
00:29:24,276 --> 00:29:26,987
Like, who would do that?

593
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:28,779
- Yeah.
- I got mind wiped.

594
00:29:28,824 --> 00:29:30,092
Yeah, I was living

595
00:29:30,136 --> 00:29:33,197
as this other dude
named Isaac for months.

596
00:29:33,241 --> 00:29:35,908
Um... that is exactly

597
00:29:35,952 --> 00:29:38,051
kind of close to my situation.

598
00:29:38,926 --> 00:29:42,469
So I'm being hunted
by this douchebag monster,

599
00:29:42,512 --> 00:29:44,961
and, like, I need a place
to crash, right?

600
00:29:45,005 --> 00:29:46,492
That's when I remember

601
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:48,242
that squirrely little
human friend of yours

602
00:29:48,285 --> 00:29:51,084
said that he killed Ember,

603
00:29:51,128 --> 00:29:53,489
and I'm like, "I could
take that guy's place."

604
00:29:53,533 --> 00:29:55,851
Live to fuck another day,
you know?

605
00:29:55,895 --> 00:29:57,338
It's kind of nice, you know?

606
00:29:57,382 --> 00:30:01,536
Freeing to... to live as
someone else for a little bit.

607
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,373
Yeah, I guess.

608
00:30:03,417 --> 00:30:07,397
You know,
a famous cocksman once told me,

609
00:30:07,441 --> 00:30:09,233
"Once you've had quantity,

610
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:11,682
the only thing left
is strange."

611
00:30:12,995 --> 00:30:15,750
And, boy, is this place
full of strange.

612
00:30:15,793 --> 00:30:18,680
I mean, Isaac's life was great.

613
00:30:18,723 --> 00:30:23,009
Lot of friends,
big, uh... family.

614
00:30:24,628 --> 00:30:27,383
But eventually, it...
it all ends,

615
00:30:27,427 --> 00:30:29,483
and your old life,

616
00:30:29,526 --> 00:30:32,237
your old problems,

617
00:30:32,281 --> 00:30:33,549
they catch up to you.

618
00:30:33,594 --> 00:30:35,255
Or your problems never find you

619
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:36,829
and the party goes on forever.

620
00:30:36,873 --> 00:30:40,109
Oh, look at that, I'm dry.

621
00:30:40,153 --> 00:30:43,214
Is that... did you make for me?

622
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,402
- Yes.
- Josh special?

623
00:30:45,445 --> 00:30:47,806
Uh, yes.
I... I made it for you.

624
00:30:47,851 --> 00:30:52,224
You and me, Joshy,
we're the same.

625
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,498
We're born to be
the perfect hosts.

626
00:30:54,542 --> 00:30:57,690
We want everyone around us
to have a good time.

627
00:30:57,735 --> 00:30:59,396
We make sure of it.

628
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,496
Nobody does the same for us.

629
00:31:01,539 --> 00:31:02,677
Mm-mm.

630
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,431
This is to Josh, not to Isaac.

631
00:31:05,475 --> 00:31:06,743
This is to the real you.

632
00:31:12,516 --> 00:31:13,741
I'm sorry.

633
00:31:13,784 --> 00:31:16,627
I... I pee-peed in it,

634
00:31:16,671 --> 00:31:18,901
and you don't...
you don't drink that.

635
00:31:18,945 --> 00:31:20,126
So...

636
00:31:22,443 --> 00:31:25,637
This the dumbest plan.

637
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,692
Franky says the disguises
won't matter.

638
00:31:27,736 --> 00:31:31,016
If the Black Card works,
nobody will question them.

639
00:31:31,059 --> 00:31:32,853
I feel like an idiot.

640
00:31:32,896 --> 00:31:34,601
Excuse me, sir.

641
00:31:34,645 --> 00:31:36,526
You have a fresh look.

642
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:38,144
Have you considered modeling?

643
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:43,786
Kay, it's just soup.

644
00:31:45,011 --> 00:31:47,066
Can't choke.
It's not scalding.

645
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,815
It's totally safe.

646
00:31:52,357 --> 00:31:55,244
Oh, look at that line.
This is gonna take forever.

647
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,775
I've been thinking,
while we're here,

648
00:31:56,819 --> 00:31:58,262
we should get a bit extra.

649
00:31:58,305 --> 00:32:02,023
Five for Marina,
five for Franky, ten for us.

650
00:32:02,066 --> 00:32:05,259
We'd have to be insanely
lucky to get that much.

651
00:32:05,303 --> 00:32:08,977
The more luck we get,
the more bad luck Quentin gets.

652
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,682
When this is over,
the McAllisters

653
00:32:10,725 --> 00:32:12,650
will still be after us.

654
00:32:12,694 --> 00:32:17,155
We'll need to do
some major cloaking spell.

655
00:32:17,199 --> 00:32:18,817
It could kill him.

656
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:21,003
Hey!
There's a truck outside

657
00:32:21,047 --> 00:32:22,708
giving out free ice cream!

658
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:27,520
I mean,
two extra coins can't hurt.

659
00:32:30,056 --> 00:32:32,112
It's... it's all good.
Soup spills all the time.

660
00:32:32,155 --> 00:32:34,124
Thanks.

661
00:32:34,167 --> 00:32:36,179
Damn it.

662
00:32:36,223 --> 00:32:39,241
How the hell do you get
a paper cut from a paper towel?

663
00:32:39,284 --> 00:32:41,470
- Welcome.
- Hi.

664
00:32:41,515 --> 00:32:45,057
So how can I help you today?

665
00:32:45,101 --> 00:32:47,637
We need twelve contained
current coins.

666
00:32:51,399 --> 00:32:53,585
- Here.
- No, God.

667
00:32:53,628 --> 00:32:54,591
Keep it away.

668
00:32:58,265 --> 00:32:59,708
Everything looks in order.

669
00:32:59,751 --> 00:33:02,025
Just need to check
one little thing.

670
00:33:11,035 --> 00:33:11,996
Shoot.

671
00:33:16,064 --> 00:33:17,332
Did you hear something?

672
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:21,356
Where did it come from?

673
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,587
Out of the... toilet.

674
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:25,686
All right, then,
I'll send this requisition

675
00:33:25,729 --> 00:33:28,178
to the home office,
and they'll return your coins.

676
00:33:36,356 --> 00:33:38,456
I thought you said
your phone wasn't working.

677
00:33:45,716 --> 00:33:47,858
It's a voicemail from my mom.

678
00:33:47,902 --> 00:33:49,520
Do you think...

679
00:33:49,564 --> 00:33:51,313
Q.

680
00:33:51,357 --> 00:33:52,450
It's got to be about my dad.
I'm not gonna...

681
00:33:52,495 --> 00:33:53,501
No, Q, the bear.

682
00:33:57,524 --> 00:33:59,492
Okay.

683
00:34:03,996 --> 00:34:05,614
Oh.

684
00:34:05,658 --> 00:34:07,539
Your request has been flagged

685
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:09,506
for follow-up with a supervisor.

686
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,731
Wait here, please.

687
00:34:15,979 --> 00:34:17,553
A requisition follow-up for you.

688
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,784
Christ, can it wait?

689
00:34:19,828 --> 00:34:20,965
Fine.

690
00:34:36,272 --> 00:34:38,414
Sorry, I can't see for shit.

691
00:34:42,132 --> 00:34:43,706
This bloody thing's
making me crazy.

692
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,325
Do you mind?
No.

693
00:34:45,368 --> 00:34:46,549
Do... do your thing.

694
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:49,523
What do I do?

695
00:34:49,566 --> 00:34:51,710
Just, please, don't listen to it

696
00:34:51,753 --> 00:34:53,547
until we hear back
from Penny and Katie.

697
00:34:55,209 --> 00:34:57,089
Oh, shit!

698
00:34:57,133 --> 00:35:00,325
Oh, Jesus Christ,
now I've got it in backwards.

699
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,136
About those coins.

700
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,322
Listen, the truth is,

701
00:35:07,367 --> 00:35:08,897
the red tape, the paperwork,

702
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:11,433
it's, in my mind,
all just a wank.

703
00:35:11,477 --> 00:35:12,789
You guys gonna
blow yourselves up?

704
00:35:12,833 --> 00:35:14,233
- No.
- No?

705
00:35:14,276 --> 00:35:15,719
Great.

706
00:35:15,763 --> 00:35:19,568
Requested... approved.

707
00:35:24,641 --> 00:35:26,740
Sorry about the inconvenience.

708
00:35:26,784 --> 00:35:28,665
Thank you very much.
You have a good day.

709
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:33,432
Jesus, shit.

710
00:35:34,568 --> 00:35:35,793
Okay, they did it.
Drop the bear!

711
00:35:39,073 --> 00:35:40,953
It really came out of the...

712
00:35:40,998 --> 00:35:42,703
I don't want to talk about it.

713
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:47,164
Thank you, brother.

714
00:35:48,301 --> 00:35:49,569
I had a feeling
things would work out,

715
00:35:49,613 --> 00:35:51,713
because they always do.

716
00:35:51,756 --> 00:35:53,680
By the way,
I'd destroy those ASAP.

717
00:35:53,724 --> 00:35:54,905
They'll be out of juice soon,

718
00:35:54,948 --> 00:35:57,135
but you don't want
to take any chances.

719
00:35:57,179 --> 00:35:58,754
I'm on it.

720
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:14,629
You nutsacked out, didn't you?

721
00:36:15,766 --> 00:36:18,827
Oh, well, "pussied out"
makes perfect sense here?

722
00:36:19,702 --> 00:36:21,932
Well, if you mean that
I couldn't go through with it,

723
00:36:21,976 --> 00:36:23,681
then, yes, you're right.

724
00:36:23,726 --> 00:36:27,705
Josh, we don't
have a choice here.

725
00:36:27,749 --> 00:36:30,285
Now, where is the rest
of the Ambrosia?

726
00:36:32,166 --> 00:36:33,915
Fine, but just know that Bacchus

727
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:35,358
will never drink
anything you give him.

728
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:37,851
Oh, I'm not gonna
give it to Bacchus.

729
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:39,251
Yeah, I'm gonna
dump it in there.

730
00:36:39,294 --> 00:36:41,044
Everyone'll drink it.

731
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:43,362
Are you nuts?
There are over 100 people here.

732
00:36:43,405 --> 00:36:45,374
You have no idea
what that will do to them.

733
00:36:45,417 --> 00:36:48,172
Well, I'm pretty sure
it'll fucking kill them.

734
00:36:48,216 --> 00:36:50,797
And I'll do it,
unless you start acting

735
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,852
like a real pussy

736
00:36:52,896 --> 00:36:56,394
and take one
for the fucking team.

737
00:36:58,275 --> 00:37:01,423
Hey, uh, I'm sorry about...

738
00:37:01,468 --> 00:37:04,879
We've all peed in things
we regret.

739
00:37:07,022 --> 00:37:11,264
I know gods are supposed
to be distant and unknowable,

740
00:37:11,307 --> 00:37:13,319
but you're a good guy.

741
00:37:16,337 --> 00:37:17,999
I want to tell you a secret.

742
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:26,221
What did you put... in this?

743
00:37:29,764 --> 00:37:31,250
I found my book.

744
00:37:31,294 --> 00:37:32,518
Now let's get
the hell out of here.

745
00:37:32,562 --> 00:37:34,137
I can't find my friends' books.

746
00:37:35,448 --> 00:37:37,504
"The following books have been
removed from circulation

747
00:37:37,548 --> 00:37:39,997
for revisions.
Q. Coldwater, A. Quinn."

748
00:37:41,178 --> 00:37:43,583
They're filling in
the endings of our books...

749
00:37:43,627 --> 00:37:45,027
the pages that were missing

750
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,557
because of the Great Blank Spot.

751
00:37:54,604 --> 00:37:55,610
Nick?

752
00:37:57,534 --> 00:37:59,634
Hey, I'm sorry about
your friends' books,

753
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:01,776
but this is our chance.

754
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,226
Come with me.
I can't.

755
00:38:04,269 --> 00:38:06,630
I... I can't leave
without their books.

756
00:38:06,675 --> 00:38:08,467
Well, I want to do the...

757
00:38:08,512 --> 00:38:10,479
Look, just go, while
you still have the chance.

758
00:38:10,523 --> 00:38:12,666
Okay, I can find
the Revision Room on my own.

759
00:38:14,503 --> 00:38:16,514
For what it's worth,

760
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:18,570
you're still on my Nice List.

761
00:38:38,163 --> 00:38:39,999
The fuck?

762
00:38:56,487 --> 00:38:58,149
Do you remember me?

763
00:38:59,505 --> 00:39:01,167
Because I don't.

764
00:39:02,522 --> 00:39:06,021
I don't remember my name
or where I came from.

765
00:39:07,421 --> 00:39:09,870
But I remember you.

766
00:39:09,913 --> 00:39:13,674
You took something from me,
something important,

767
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:17,611
and then you...
threw me in a cage,

768
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:21,984
and I would like
for you to explain.

769
00:39:22,028 --> 00:39:24,739
You remember all that,

770
00:39:24,783 --> 00:39:27,494
but you don't remember
what you are,

771
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:29,419
what you did.

772
00:39:29,463 --> 00:39:31,650
The word "monster"
has been thrown around.

773
00:39:31,693 --> 00:39:33,486
That's right.

774
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:36,066
We put you with
the rest of your kind.

775
00:39:37,204 --> 00:39:38,603
And I ate them.

776
00:39:38,647 --> 00:39:41,358
You're kind of making my case
for me here.

777
00:39:41,402 --> 00:39:43,720
We have the same parents.

778
00:39:43,763 --> 00:39:46,256
Why am I a monster
and you're a god?

779
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,268
If you don't want
to be a monster,

780
00:39:48,311 --> 00:39:49,755
then let me go.

781
00:39:49,799 --> 00:39:51,329
Give me back
what you took from me,

782
00:39:51,373 --> 00:39:52,466
and maybe I will.

783
00:39:54,521 --> 00:39:57,189
I can't... ever.

784
00:39:57,234 --> 00:39:58,677
I'm sorry.

785
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,563
It was a part of me,

786
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:05,368
and now it's a part of you.

787
00:40:07,686 --> 00:40:11,840
Burning in your body.

788
00:40:11,885 --> 00:40:13,546
Wait. Wait.

789
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:15,645
This world needs me.

790
00:40:15,689 --> 00:40:17,657
Its god is dead.

791
00:40:17,701 --> 00:40:19,538
You don't have to do this.

792
00:40:19,581 --> 00:40:21,812
There's others.
There's still time.

793
00:40:21,856 --> 00:40:23,736
We can figure something out.

794
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,311
It doesn't have to be me.

795
00:40:25,354 --> 00:40:27,979
It doesn't have to...

796
00:40:48,009 --> 00:40:50,239
What the fuck did he
just rip out of him?

797
00:40:50,283 --> 00:40:52,250
Whatever it is, to a fairy eye,

798
00:40:52,294 --> 00:40:55,530
it's like staring
straight at the sun.

799
00:40:58,723 --> 00:40:59,903
They're real.

800
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:03,184
Well, it's been a pleasure.

801
00:41:04,758 --> 00:41:06,333
The trackers on us?

802
00:41:06,377 --> 00:41:08,214
Not actually a thing.

803
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:10,356
You guys are too lawful good
to bitch out.

804
00:41:19,409 --> 00:41:21,377
- Marina.
- Hmm?

805
00:41:21,421 --> 00:41:23,389
I've been looking for you.

806
00:41:28,156 --> 00:41:29,468
Excuse me, miss.

807
00:41:29,512 --> 00:41:30,998
These are free to a good home.

808
00:41:31,042 --> 00:41:32,355
Are you interested?

809
00:41:38,039 --> 00:41:39,920
Hey, are you sure
Marina's apartment's

810
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:41,408
the safest place for us to meet?

811
00:41:41,451 --> 00:41:43,244
It's not Marina's.

812
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:45,299
It's mine.

813
00:41:45,344 --> 00:41:46,350
What did you do?

814
00:41:46,393 --> 00:41:47,967
I handled the problem.

815
00:41:48,011 --> 00:41:50,853
Now, can we do this
cloaking spell

816
00:41:50,898 --> 00:41:52,865
before the McAllisters show up
and kill all of us?

817
00:41:57,238 --> 00:41:58,857
Hey.

818
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,044
You haven't listened?

819
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:04,368
You know, your bad luck's gone.

820
00:42:04,411 --> 00:42:06,685
Safe as it'll ever be.

821
00:42:06,729 --> 00:42:11,146
But that's not
what's really stopping you.

822
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:13,508
The other me...

823
00:42:13,551 --> 00:42:16,000
Brian,

824
00:42:16,044 --> 00:42:18,450
his dad died when he was a kid.

825
00:42:19,456 --> 00:42:22,123
He was too little
to even understand.

826
00:42:22,779 --> 00:42:25,185
All of his problems
were like that.

827
00:42:25,228 --> 00:42:26,672
No sharp edges.

828
00:42:26,715 --> 00:42:27,721
Yeah.

829
00:42:29,426 --> 00:42:31,526
Look at us.

830
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:33,844
We paid a hell
of a fucking price.

831
00:42:35,637 --> 00:42:37,780
You gave up being a goddess.

832
00:42:40,448 --> 00:42:42,415
I gave up my father.

833
00:42:47,489 --> 00:42:49,282
What did we get in return?

834
00:42:50,332 --> 00:42:51,381
Magic is back.

835
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:58,728
Mm-mm, not in the way
that we wanted.

836
00:43:01,484 --> 00:43:04,545
How are you not furious?

837
00:43:07,825 --> 00:43:12,636
Because, for almost everyone,
the world is a little brighter,

838
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:16,310
even if they never know why.

839
00:43:16,353 --> 00:43:19,545
I hate the Library
for what they did,

840
00:43:19,589 --> 00:43:23,700
but my part in it,
I knew what it cost.

841
00:43:25,056 --> 00:43:27,767
And I'd do it again.

842
00:43:32,229 --> 00:43:33,934
But you wouldn't.

843
00:43:37,083 --> 00:43:39,707
Will you sit here for a minute?

844
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:40,975
Yeah.

845
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:47,229
Hi, Quentin.

846
00:43:47,273 --> 00:43:50,160
Sorry to leave a message
with bad news.

847
00:43:51,952 --> 00:43:54,314
I need to talk to you
about your father.
