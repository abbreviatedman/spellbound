1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:08,430
- Previously on
"The Magicians"...

2
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:10,080
- Are you Santa Claus?

3
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,130
- Oh, I'm not... not that.
- Magic's gone.

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:15,105
I'm not a magician,
but I could feel it

5
00:00:15,106 --> 00:00:17,040
when it was gone,
and I knew it wasn't

6
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:18,655
a coincidence when I
went into remission

7
00:00:18,656 --> 00:00:19,280
a week later.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,029
- What timeline are you from?

9
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,253
- The one where you
owe me child support.

10
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,070
I'm kidding.

11
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,209
- Kay, then if you
want me to help

12
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,080
these students, can you
tell me who they are?

13
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,160
- Their lives were
in grave danger.

14
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,075
I cast a spell that
erased their identities

15
00:00:32,076 --> 00:00:33,070
and gave them new ones.

16
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,203
- I mean, isn't there
anything you can do?

17
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,250
- If I reveal that the
spell can be reversed,

18
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,140
then someone would
reverse the spell.

19
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,030
- Bacchus, what
are you doing here?

20
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,213
Why do you want everyone
thinking you're Ember?

21
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:49,030
- Thanks for popping in.

22
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,180
- Oh, my God.

23
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,069
- Mis hermanos.

24
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,209
- Where were you?

25
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,170
We... we looked everywhere...
- Stay back.

26
00:00:56,171 --> 00:00:59,210
- Why?
- Because I'm not here to play.

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,140
- Marina.

28
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,199
Why do you look like
you're fleeing something?

29
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,180
It's me, Margo,
previously known as Janet.

30
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,279
- Look, I'm gonna
do you a solid.

31
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,670
Don't go up there.

32
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:13,059
- Why?

33
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,149
- Because there's an uninvited

34
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,210
guest in my apartment
who's probably killing

35
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,209
your friends right about now.

36
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:18,635
Look, I don't know what he is,

37
00:01:18,636 --> 00:01:20,059
and I'm assuming it's a "he"

38
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:23,060
because this is some
toxically masculine behavior,

39
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,060
but he walked through every
ward and shield I had,

40
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,000
set off every alarm.

41
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,140
So instead of going
inside, I'm gonna get

42
00:01:30,141 --> 00:01:31,070
a breakfast burrito.

43
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:34,000
You wanna join?
- We have to help them.

44
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,090
- Oh, you're one of those.

45
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:38,149
Fine, you wanna
stick your neck out?

46
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,119
There's something inside
that can help you.

47
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,030
- Do tell.

48
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,240
- No traveling.

49
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,100
Where to start?

50
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,150
Order is important
with these things.

51
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,675
Who goes first?

52
00:01:50,676 --> 00:01:52,179
Who goes last?

53
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,220
Oh, you keep looking at him...

54
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,220
Because you don't
want him to die?

55
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:00,210
Which means he has
to go before you.

56
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,180
You care about all of them.

57
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,700
So you're last.

58
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,120
- Thank Christ.

59
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,213
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

60
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:16,060
Not... Eliot.

61
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:18,170
- This thing has
god-level power,

62
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,029
and I have a bad
history with gods,

63
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,090
since apparently one killed me.

64
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,210
No, it's fine.

65
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,173
Different me, but I didn't want

66
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,140
to get caught off guard
again, so I called in

67
00:02:28,141 --> 00:02:31,190
every favor I had to
build a defense system.

68
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,665
All you have to do is get him

69
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:34,120
to sit in the gold chair.

70
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,170
- Why the gold chair?

71
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,060
- Because it had
to be something,

72
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,249
and everybody wants to
sit in the gold chair.

73
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,029
It's total power move.

74
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,089
- I'm so glad you came.

75
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,210
Saves me having
to hunt you down.

76
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,000
I've got so much of that
ahead of me already.

77
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,209
- What is he talking about?

78
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,190
- He's, uh, hunting gods.

79
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:57,059
It's vengeance for
locking you in the castle.

80
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,090
- They did more than
that, and so did you.

81
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,120
You tried to kill me.

82
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:10,149
You were all part of it.

83
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:15,210
- Then what?

84
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,149
- There's a bell on the table.

85
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,180
Ring it.

86
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:22,110
- And he explodes?

87
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,030
- He gets a face full
of distilled ambrosia.

88
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,250
It's basically meth for gods.

89
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,210
Its gets them high,
but an overdose

90
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,183
will knock them on their asses.

91
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:34,119
- Tell me Eliot is still
in there somewhere.

92
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,130
- Not that I've seen.

93
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,680
- Your round, innocent
face will make your death

94
00:03:39,681 --> 00:03:42,135
particularly upsetting,
so I've decided

95
00:03:42,136 --> 00:03:43,090
to start with you.

96
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,090
- I can give you Bacchus.

97
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:54,655
- You're hunting gods,
and I found him hiding

98
00:03:54,656 --> 00:03:56,190
someplace far away.

99
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:59,250
Hiding from you, right?

100
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:05,059
I can take you there...
if you let them live.

101
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,590
All of them.

102
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:20,750
- Perhaps we can be
friends after all.

103
00:04:31,648 --> 00:04:33,638
- So where is everyone else?

104
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,708
- I don't know.

105
00:04:35,728 --> 00:04:37,708
They were supposed
to remain hidden.

106
00:04:39,728 --> 00:04:41,758
I meant to protect you.

107
00:04:43,688 --> 00:04:46,678
- Doesn't really seem
like I need protection.

108
00:04:46,688 --> 00:04:48,638
I mean, nothing your
spell threw at me

109
00:04:48,648 --> 00:04:49,768
even left a scratch.

110
00:04:49,778 --> 00:04:52,628
Reynard did say, even
without their powers,

111
00:04:52,638 --> 00:04:53,738
gods are hard to kill.

112
00:04:54,778 --> 00:04:59,627
- I wouldn't underestimate
the will of Irene McAllister.

113
00:04:59,628 --> 00:05:01,687
Huh.

114
00:05:01,688 --> 00:05:03,698
Tell a few people that
you're leaving forever,

115
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:07,588
and look what the
ungrateful bastards do.

116
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:09,768
Nice.

117
00:05:09,778 --> 00:05:11,688
- You know, if
the deal is broken

118
00:05:11,698 --> 00:05:13,753
and the McAllisters
are coming, I'm gonna

119
00:05:13,754 --> 00:05:14,757
have to warn everyone.

120
00:05:14,758 --> 00:05:16,748
- Contacting your friends will

121
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,738
put a target on their backs.

122
00:05:18,748 --> 00:05:23,608
- To be clear, you put
the target on our backs.

123
00:05:23,618 --> 00:05:25,628
You betrayed us.

124
00:05:25,638 --> 00:05:26,678
- Hmm.

125
00:05:26,688 --> 00:05:29,778
- I sacrificed everything
to bring back magic.

126
00:05:29,798 --> 00:05:32,757
You know what I sacrificed,

127
00:05:32,758 --> 00:05:34,508
and look what you do with it.

128
00:05:35,638 --> 00:05:39,707
- Yes, Ms. Wicker, I made a deal

129
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:44,697
with the goddamn
Library, and in doing so,

130
00:05:44,698 --> 00:05:47,798
I saved your lives.

131
00:05:48,508 --> 00:05:50,501
- Yeah, well, you're pretty
- fucking quick to compromise,

132
00:05:50,508 --> 00:05:51,508
You know that?

133
00:05:52,738 --> 00:05:54,258
Now, I need to find my friends,

134
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:57,273
but I can't do magic,
so you're going to cast

135
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:58,748
the locator spell for me.

136
00:06:19,778 --> 00:06:21,748
- Dean Fogg. Finally.

137
00:06:21,758 --> 00:06:23,688
- I only have a moment.

138
00:06:25,668 --> 00:06:26,678
You know how the Library

139
00:06:26,688 --> 00:06:30,608
contains the books of
everyone who ever lived?

140
00:06:30,618 --> 00:06:31,688
- Yeah.

141
00:06:31,698 --> 00:06:34,627
- The Great Blank Spot is over.

142
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:36,748
The Library can update
their books again.

143
00:06:36,758 --> 00:06:40,543
So, if your friends were to get

144
00:06:40,544 --> 00:06:43,687
their memories back,
the Library would know.

145
00:06:43,688 --> 00:06:47,778
They'd try to find
them to keep them safe

146
00:06:47,798 --> 00:06:51,688
from the monster that
you warned us about.

147
00:06:52,688 --> 00:06:54,708
- You're telling me they
have books that describe

148
00:06:54,728 --> 00:06:58,627
every damn thing everyone
does or ever will do,

149
00:06:58,628 --> 00:07:00,627
when you're sleeping,
when you're awake,

150
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:01,778
naughty or nice?

151
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:04,508
You know how much time
that would have saved me?

152
00:07:04,518 --> 00:07:06,627
- Can we please not with
the Santa stuff right now?

153
00:07:06,628 --> 00:07:08,791
- Well, could you please not
- with the angsty, nerdy stuff?

154
00:07:08,798 --> 00:07:10,153
Huh?

155
00:07:10,154 --> 00:07:11,507
No, 'cause that's who you are,

156
00:07:11,508 --> 00:07:12,601
and I don't judge you for it.

157
00:07:12,608 --> 00:07:14,698
- Dean Fogg was trying
to give me a message.

158
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:17,678
Look, if we escape, they'll
just read our books,

159
00:07:17,688 --> 00:07:19,548
find out where we are,
and come after us.

160
00:07:19,558 --> 00:07:21,678
- So we just take
the books with us,

161
00:07:21,688 --> 00:07:23,768
or, uh... or destroy 'em.

162
00:07:23,778 --> 00:07:26,508
But first we have
to actually escape.

163
00:07:28,508 --> 00:07:29,739
- I can get us to the fireplace.

164
00:07:31,608 --> 00:07:32,658
Just be ready.

165
00:07:33,768 --> 00:07:36,518
- All I'm offering
is a location.

166
00:07:36,528 --> 00:07:37,658
The rest is on you.

167
00:07:37,678 --> 00:07:40,673
- Knowing where Bacchus
is doesn't help me

168
00:07:40,674 --> 00:07:42,698
if he runs away, which he'll do

169
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:43,768
the second I show up.

170
00:07:43,778 --> 00:07:47,193
You see my problem, and
how maybe it is just

171
00:07:47,194 --> 00:07:48,698
easier to kill you all.

172
00:07:55,748 --> 00:07:57,688
- Do you know what this is?

173
00:08:03,738 --> 00:08:07,798
- Where did you get that?

174
00:08:08,508 --> 00:08:11,678
- I didn't, but I
know that enough of it

175
00:08:11,679 --> 00:08:13,738
will mess up a god long
enough for you to do

176
00:08:13,739 --> 00:08:14,728
whatever you need to do.

177
00:08:14,738 --> 00:08:15,778
Excuse me, Margo?

178
00:08:16,748 --> 00:08:18,268
Quick talk?

179
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,778
Could you stop volunteering?

180
00:08:25,798 --> 00:08:26,778
I know Bacchus.

181
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:27,758
He's a friend.

182
00:08:27,768 --> 00:08:29,778
- Great.

183
00:08:29,798 --> 00:08:31,778
Then you'll poison him.

184
00:08:31,798 --> 00:08:34,258
He'll never suspect a friend.

185
00:08:38,698 --> 00:08:40,618
I could always kill you.

186
00:08:40,628 --> 00:08:41,757
Awesome.

187
00:08:41,758 --> 00:08:43,528
Great choices.

188
00:08:43,538 --> 00:08:45,528
Well, let's get going, then.

189
00:08:45,538 --> 00:08:47,648
Guys, in case it even
needs to be said,

190
00:08:47,658 --> 00:08:48,658
I know Marina.

191
00:08:48,668 --> 00:08:49,768
She is not a helpful person.

192
00:08:49,778 --> 00:08:55,558
So just act accordingly.

193
00:08:57,508 --> 00:08:58,757
Of course I'm getting paid.

194
00:08:58,758 --> 00:09:00,718
The McAllisters have a
bounty on your heads,

195
00:09:00,728 --> 00:09:01,768
dead or alive.

196
00:09:01,778 --> 00:09:04,158
The real yous, not
the witness-protection

197
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:04,778
identities.

198
00:09:04,788 --> 00:09:06,708
So you can see how it'd
be profitable for me

199
00:09:06,718 --> 00:09:08,508
to get you back to normal.

200
00:09:08,518 --> 00:09:09,480
- What are they offering?

201
00:09:11,508 --> 00:09:12,528
- Three Deweys.

202
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:13,548
- What the hell's a Dewey?

203
00:09:13,558 --> 00:09:15,688
- As in Melvil Dewey,
the most famous librarian

204
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:16,618
of all time.

205
00:09:16,628 --> 00:09:17,771
He has his own decimal system.

206
00:09:17,778 --> 00:09:19,548
- Well, I think
you're being generous

207
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:20,678
with the word "famous."

208
00:09:22,718 --> 00:09:25,638
- Okay, so in the
new world order,

209
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,518
there's just enough
magic in the air

210
00:09:27,528 --> 00:09:29,678
to keep the boring
masses fat and happy,

211
00:09:29,698 --> 00:09:31,658
but you got an itch to
do something bigger,

212
00:09:31,668 --> 00:09:34,507
you have to file a
request with the Library.

213
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:35,781
- They decide if you're
- trustworthy, and they give you

214
00:09:35,788 --> 00:09:37,778
A cute little battery
in the shape of a coin.

215
00:09:37,788 --> 00:09:40,548
They put the faces of
famous librarians on there,

216
00:09:40,558 --> 00:09:42,757
but Dewey's the only
one people can remember.

217
00:09:42,758 --> 00:09:46,758
Well, and Laura Bush, but
Bushes just never stuck.

218
00:09:46,768 --> 00:09:48,758
- All right, well, we'll
pay the bounty ourselves.

219
00:09:49,718 --> 00:09:51,508
- How are you gonna get Dewey's?

220
00:09:51,518 --> 00:09:52,651
- I don't know.
- We'll figure it out.

221
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:54,508
We always... - Sometimes.

222
00:09:54,518 --> 00:09:56,698
- Most of the time we do.

223
00:09:59,788 --> 00:10:02,757
- Five Deweys to make
it worth the delay,

224
00:10:02,758 --> 00:10:04,758
and know that I have
trackers on all of you,

225
00:10:04,768 --> 00:10:08,578
so if you try to run,
it won't go your way.

226
00:10:13,728 --> 00:10:15,518
Don't drink all my beer.

227
00:10:22,558 --> 00:10:27,711
- Seems like this is the place.

228
00:10:27,718 --> 00:10:28,728
- It is.

229
00:10:28,738 --> 00:10:31,748
Those are maenads,
Bacchus followers.

230
00:10:31,758 --> 00:10:33,528
- Get to it, then.

231
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:39,268
Oh, and if they have
pizza, bring me some.

232
00:10:44,508 --> 00:10:45,748
- We can still find a way out.

233
00:10:45,758 --> 00:10:46,721
- We already did.
- This is it.

234
00:10:46,728 --> 00:10:48,528
We're doing it right now.

235
00:10:48,538 --> 00:10:49,581
- You had a weapon that
could have stopped him,

236
00:10:49,588 --> 00:10:52,508
and instead of using
it, you gave it to him.

237
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,658
We tried that already with Julia's
god-killing bullet.

238
00:10:54,668 --> 00:10:57,728
All it did was kill the monster's host,
which in this case is Eliot.

239
00:10:57,738 --> 00:11:02,788
Who, for all we know, is dead.

240
00:11:03,508 --> 00:11:04,748
- Or he's trapped in there,

241
00:11:04,758 --> 00:11:06,668
forced to watch everything
the monster does,

242
00:11:06,678 --> 00:11:08,758
just waiting for us to
find a way to help him.

243
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:14,757
What are you gonna
slip the ambrosia into?

244
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:18,758
I guess I'll make a Fillorian
version of his favorite drink.

245
00:11:18,768 --> 00:11:20,253
Margarita, but instead of

246
00:11:20,254 --> 00:11:23,678
salt on the rim, it will be...
- God meth. Perfect.

247
00:11:23,698 --> 00:11:26,758
Now go poison his ass so we can
get out of this malarial swamp.

248
00:11:26,768 --> 00:11:27,761
You know what's incredible?

249
00:11:27,768 --> 00:11:29,778
How you can be
such a good friend

250
00:11:29,788 --> 00:11:37,788
and such a terrible friend
at the exact same time.

251
00:11:39,558 --> 00:11:43,708
There's not a lot
that I can relate to in this world.

252
00:11:44,728 --> 00:11:51,558
People here are...
well, people, generally,

253
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:54,528
and me, not so much.

254
00:11:54,538 --> 00:11:55,778
But I relate to you.

255
00:11:55,788 --> 00:12:00,627
I hate being alone.

256
00:12:00,628 --> 00:12:03,678
I don't like being left
with my own thoughts,

257
00:12:03,698 --> 00:12:05,588
such as they are.

258
00:12:05,598 --> 00:12:08,748
I need friends.

259
00:12:08,758 --> 00:12:11,533
- One way of making
friends is not murdering

260
00:12:11,534 --> 00:12:12,528
everyone you meet.

261
00:12:12,538 --> 00:12:15,627
- Yes, you get my dilemma,
but you're like me.

262
00:12:15,628 --> 00:12:17,538
Josh said so.

263
00:12:17,548 --> 00:12:19,748
A bad friend and a good
friend at the same time.

264
00:12:19,758 --> 00:12:20,748
How do you do it?

265
00:12:20,758 --> 00:12:22,558
- I have no choice.

266
00:12:23,638 --> 00:12:27,578
- You were friends with Eliot.

267
00:12:28,578 --> 00:12:30,738
Very best friends.

268
00:12:30,748 --> 00:12:32,598
Now you can be friends with me.

269
00:12:32,608 --> 00:12:33,788
It'll be the same.

270
00:12:34,508 --> 00:12:36,507
You can show me how
to be more like him.

271
00:12:36,508 --> 00:12:38,608
- No.

272
00:12:38,618 --> 00:12:40,538
I love Eliot.

273
00:12:40,548 --> 00:12:42,548
I would do anything
for him, even help you,

274
00:12:42,558 --> 00:12:46,538
but you and I, we won't
ever be friends...

275
00:12:46,548 --> 00:12:48,728
Unless you let me talk to him.

276
00:12:48,738 --> 00:12:51,528
Prove he's still alive in there.

277
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:52,738
- I can't do that.

278
00:12:52,748 --> 00:12:55,538
- But you could let him go.

279
00:12:55,548 --> 00:12:57,788
You could choose a new body.

280
00:12:58,508 --> 00:12:59,598
- But I like this one.

281
00:12:59,608 --> 00:13:03,678
I like the way
people look at me,

282
00:13:03,698 --> 00:13:06,577
and you and your
friends care so deeply

283
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:08,778
about what happens to it.

284
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,638
Why would I ever leave it?

285
00:13:19,648 --> 00:13:20,778
- Hi.

286
00:13:20,788 --> 00:13:22,718
- I'm here to see Bacchus.

287
00:13:22,728 --> 00:13:25,518
- Um, yeah... I don't know
what you're talking about.

288
00:13:25,528 --> 00:13:28,643
Um, it's... it's Ember, s...
- "Bacchanal" is the word

289
00:13:28,644 --> 00:13:29,758
you're looking for.

290
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:31,558
Cut the crap, Shoshana.

291
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:32,551
It's me, Josh, from
the Bedsty party.

292
00:13:32,558 --> 00:13:33,548
Come on.

293
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:35,548
- Oh, I... I didn't
think you'd remember me.

294
00:13:36,508 --> 00:13:38,788
Well, it's actually... you
know, it's really good

295
00:13:37,628 --> 00:13:38,788
that you're here,

296
00:13:39,508 --> 00:13:42,508
'cause he's been darker
the last few weeks.

297
00:13:42,518 --> 00:13:43,761
I think a friendly
face could really help.

298
00:13:43,768 --> 00:13:45,588
- Great.

299
00:13:48,518 --> 00:13:49,558
- Hey, Q?

300
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,548
- Oh, my...
- Oh, my God.

301
00:13:51,558 --> 00:13:53,528
- Hey.

302
00:13:53,538 --> 00:13:54,751
- Where have you been?
- We couldn't find you.

303
00:13:54,758 --> 00:13:56,558
- "Enrolled at Brakebills,"

304
00:13:54,758 --> 00:13:57,757
she said, fully
aware of the irony.

305
00:13:57,758 --> 00:14:00,508
I just, um...

306
00:14:01,618 --> 00:14:03,538
- I don't know where to start.
- Uh...

307
00:14:04,588 --> 00:14:06,507
Have you heard
anything about Alice?

308
00:14:06,508 --> 00:14:07,528
- No.

309
00:14:07,538 --> 00:14:09,548
No, I mean, not
since she completely

310
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:10,771
screwed us over at
Blackspire, why?

311
00:14:10,778 --> 00:14:12,518
Where is everyone else?

312
00:14:13,668 --> 00:14:16,548
If the Library's going
to arrest us on sight,

313
00:14:16,558 --> 00:14:19,608
how do we get one of these
coins, much less five?

314
00:14:19,618 --> 00:14:22,648
- I asked around, so there
might be another way.

315
00:14:22,658 --> 00:14:24,643
The Library's official story

316
00:14:24,644 --> 00:14:26,627
is that the McAllister family

317
00:14:26,628 --> 00:14:28,618
heroically turned magic back on.

318
00:14:28,628 --> 00:14:30,628
So they gave them a free pass

319
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:32,627
to as many coins as they want.

320
00:14:32,628 --> 00:14:35,563
They give them these special
cards with no limits,

321
00:14:35,564 --> 00:14:36,518
no questions asked.

322
00:14:36,528 --> 00:14:37,571
Only a few of them
exist, and Hedges

323
00:14:37,578 --> 00:14:38,591
are calling them Black Cards.

324
00:14:38,598 --> 00:14:39,627
- We could steal one.

325
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:42,528
- If you steal a credit
card, it only works until

326
00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:43,528
it's reported stolen.

327
00:14:43,538 --> 00:14:45,758
With something this
valuable, it's gonna happen

328
00:14:44,598 --> 00:14:45,757
pretty damn quick.

329
00:14:45,758 --> 00:14:46,738
- Forgery, maybe?

330
00:14:46,748 --> 00:14:48,718
- Good enough to
fool the Library?

331
00:14:48,728 --> 00:14:50,788
- I used to know a guy,
a master counterfeiter.

332
00:14:51,508 --> 00:14:53,568
The Beast killed him, but...
- But that

333
00:14:53,569 --> 00:14:54,528
was in your timeline.

334
00:14:54,538 --> 00:14:56,588
- I did know Franky
since before Brakebills,

335
00:14:56,598 --> 00:14:58,658
so hopefully your Penny did too.

336
00:14:58,668 --> 00:15:02,508
And hopefully he
has the same number.

337
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:06,538
Damn it.

338
00:15:06,548 --> 00:15:07,758
I still have the DJ's phone.

339
00:15:10,628 --> 00:15:11,771
Well, the good
news is your Penny

340
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:14,168
has the same password as
me, so I'm downloading

341
00:15:14,169 --> 00:15:15,548
his contacts right now.

342
00:15:15,558 --> 00:15:17,043
- Ugh.

343
00:15:17,044 --> 00:15:18,528
So many Insta notifications.

344
00:15:18,538 --> 00:15:19,731
- Okay, I got his number.
- I'll try him.

345
00:15:19,738 --> 00:15:21,578
- I can't log in.

346
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:22,631
It wants to send a text message

347
00:15:22,638 --> 00:15:23,788
to my old phone to confirm,

348
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:26,568
but if I had my old
phone, why the hell

349
00:15:26,569 --> 00:15:27,578
would I be doing this?

350
00:15:28,608 --> 00:15:29,993
- Have you talked
to your dad lately?

351
00:15:30,508 --> 00:15:32,548
- I called him
from Brian's phone,

352
00:15:32,558 --> 00:15:33,757
but nobody picked up.

353
00:15:33,758 --> 00:15:35,558
- Nobody answers their phone

354
00:15:35,578 --> 00:15:36,781
when they don't recognize
the number, right?

355
00:15:36,788 --> 00:15:38,648
- You're probably right.

356
00:15:38,658 --> 00:15:40,578
- Guys, he picked up.

357
00:15:43,758 --> 00:15:45,638
- Oh, I don't think
you can park there.

358
00:15:45,648 --> 00:15:47,628
- Yeah, I don't think he cares.

359
00:15:47,638 --> 00:15:50,608
Shit just always seems
to work out for Franky.

360
00:15:50,618 --> 00:15:51,788
- Another timeline?

361
00:15:52,508 --> 00:15:53,507
That's wild.

362
00:15:53,508 --> 00:15:54,508
I thought you were dead.

363
00:15:54,509 --> 00:15:55,508
- Likewise.

364
00:15:55,518 --> 00:15:56,591
So the Franky I knew
was a counterfeiter.

365
00:15:56,598 --> 00:15:58,778
- So am I, but for most jobs,

366
00:15:58,788 --> 00:16:00,608
my skills are overkill.

367
00:16:00,618 --> 00:16:03,548
Duping objects to fool
regular dopes is simple.

368
00:16:03,558 --> 00:16:05,608
99% of the art you see
in museums is fake,

369
00:16:05,618 --> 00:16:07,548
because why waste the real thing

370
00:16:07,558 --> 00:16:08,781
on people who can't tell
the difference anyway?

371
00:16:08,788 --> 00:16:10,638
Fooling Magicians, though,

372
00:16:10,648 --> 00:16:12,658
that's where the
special sauce comes in.

373
00:16:12,668 --> 00:16:14,507
So what's the MacGuffin?

374
00:16:14,508 --> 00:16:15,598
- A Library Black Card.

375
00:16:17,508 --> 00:16:18,816
- That's gonna take
a lot of sauce.

376
00:16:20,628 --> 00:16:21,701
- You know what?
- Let me get that.

377
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:22,758
That's probably for me.

378
00:16:27,658 --> 00:16:29,588
- Congratulations...
- Not now, guys.

379
00:16:32,538 --> 00:16:33,548
You know what?

380
00:16:33,558 --> 00:16:35,618
Actually, I'm gonna grab... Thank you.
Thanks.

381
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:36,638
Have a good one.

382
00:16:42,518 --> 00:16:43,826
- Are you gonna
explain that, or...

383
00:16:44,508 --> 00:16:45,508
- Are they even your size?

384
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:46,508
- They're always my size.

385
00:16:46,678 --> 00:16:48,757
Anyway, uh, Library Black Card.

386
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,578
That's tricky, but I can do it.

387
00:16:50,588 --> 00:16:52,608
- Yeah, what'll it cost us?

388
00:16:52,618 --> 00:16:54,668
- Whatever you're
withdrawing from the Library,

389
00:16:54,678 --> 00:16:56,608
double it.

390
00:16:56,618 --> 00:16:58,558
- Ten Dewey coins?

391
00:16:58,578 --> 00:17:00,551
- That's like "raise an army
- of the dead" level magic.

392
00:17:00,558 --> 00:17:01,628
- That is a big ask.
- Yeah.

393
00:17:01,638 --> 00:17:04,638
If my forgery works,
it won't matter.

394
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,658
Now, I'm gonna need some stuff.

395
00:17:06,668 --> 00:17:08,717
I'm gonna need at least two

396
00:17:08,718 --> 00:17:11,558
minutes with a real Black
Card to use as a mold,

397
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:11,558
two Philly cheesesteaks,

398
00:17:11,568 --> 00:17:14,598
four liters of cherry
soda, not store brand...

399
00:17:14,608 --> 00:17:15,603
That's a deal breaker.

400
00:17:15,604 --> 00:17:16,598
- I know. I know.

401
00:17:16,608 --> 00:17:17,581
- And at least a
third of a Dewey coin

402
00:17:17,588 --> 00:17:19,528
to get us started.

403
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,528
- You need a battery
to get more batteries?

404
00:17:21,538 --> 00:17:22,563
- Yeah.

405
00:17:22,564 --> 00:17:23,588
Call it, uh, seed magic.

406
00:17:23,598 --> 00:17:26,663
- Oh, uh... we can't exactly
walk into the Library

407
00:17:26,664 --> 00:17:27,678
and just ask for one.

408
00:17:27,688 --> 00:17:29,788
- Well, there's a game of
Push happening tonight.

409
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:31,518
- What's Push?

410
00:17:31,528 --> 00:17:32,568
- It's a card game.

411
00:17:32,578 --> 00:17:34,638
- High rollers play for Deweys,

412
00:17:34,648 --> 00:17:36,588
but you can buy in for less.

413
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:42,578
Any of you good at cards?

414
00:17:46,658 --> 00:17:48,658
A Magic card game is hard
under normal circumstances,

415
00:17:49,508 --> 00:17:51,541
but right now the Library's
only putting out enough magic

416
00:17:51,548 --> 00:17:52,568
for small-scale spells.

417
00:17:52,578 --> 00:17:54,788
I mean, one big transformation,

418
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:57,598
and I'm gonna black
out the entire room.

419
00:17:57,608 --> 00:17:58,701
- Yeah, it's about efficiency.

420
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:02,548
Some Magicians are semi trucks,
guzzling magic to do a simple spell.

421
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:04,518
Some of us are Priuses.

422
00:18:04,528 --> 00:18:05,698
What are you?

423
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,618
- A sensible, mid-sized...

424
00:18:07,638 --> 00:18:09,558
- What was the one that
would always explode?

425
00:18:09,568 --> 00:18:10,618
- Yeah, that.

426
00:18:10,638 --> 00:18:12,648
- Hey, can we back him up?

427
00:18:14,578 --> 00:18:16,608
No, no, not... not me.

428
00:18:16,618 --> 00:18:17,728
I can't even make a spark.

429
00:18:17,738 --> 00:18:20,598
- I'm... well, I'm... kind
of persona non grata

430
00:18:20,608 --> 00:18:22,648
at Push games in
this city, so...

431
00:18:22,658 --> 00:18:23,638
- I just don't want to.

432
00:18:23,648 --> 00:18:26,598
- It's a one-on-one game,
anyway, so no backup.

433
00:18:26,608 --> 00:18:28,658
But, uh, good luck.

434
00:18:30,518 --> 00:18:31,688
- What do you have to wager?

435
00:18:31,698 --> 00:18:34,588
It's a protection amulet.

436
00:18:34,598 --> 00:18:35,598
It's sort of all-purpose.

437
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,548
- It's not good enough.

438
00:18:41,558 --> 00:18:43,748
If you can't buy in,
make room for somebody who can.

439
00:18:44,728 --> 00:18:45,723
- Uh, wait.

440
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:46,718
Um, he's a Traveler.

441
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:51,658
I'll wager his exclusive
services for 48 hours.

442
00:18:51,668 --> 00:18:52,757
- A year.

443
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:54,608
- A month - Whoa, hold on.
- I won't lose.

444
00:18:54,618 --> 00:18:56,588
- But you're a loser.

445
00:18:56,598 --> 00:18:57,573
- A month.

446
00:18:57,574 --> 00:18:58,548
No questions asked.

447
00:18:59,668 --> 00:19:05,208
Welcome to the game.

448
00:19:11,578 --> 00:19:12,741
- Kay, the rules
of Push are simple.

449
00:19:12,748 --> 00:19:13,688
It's like the game War.

450
00:19:13,698 --> 00:19:15,508
Two players.

451
00:19:15,518 --> 00:19:16,211
Each draws a card.

452
00:19:16,508 --> 00:19:18,568
High card wins the hand.

453
00:19:18,578 --> 00:19:20,528
When the deck is
gone, the game's over.

454
00:19:20,538 --> 00:19:23,188
But the real art of the game
is knowing how to cheat.

455
00:19:27,718 --> 00:19:29,718
See, a... a shuffled deck of cards

456
00:19:29,728 --> 00:19:31,588
is not a fixed thing.

457
00:19:31,598 --> 00:19:37,638
It's a cloud of possibilities...

458
00:19:37,648 --> 00:19:40,258
And you can change the
odds if you know how.

459
00:19:50,768 --> 00:19:53,588
Put the right card
into your hand,

460
00:19:53,598 --> 00:19:56,198
or the wrong card
into your opponents.

461
00:20:10,638 --> 00:20:11,638
- Wait, what is that?

462
00:20:11,648 --> 00:20:16,048
- Rules of Poker.

463
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:22,708
You'll have to beat three
opponents to win the whole thing.

464
00:20:22,718 --> 00:20:25,178
- Shall we?

465
00:20:33,538 --> 00:20:35,697
- The more probability spells

466
00:20:35,698 --> 00:20:38,758
that you throw around,
the more improbable

467
00:20:35,708 --> 00:20:39,258
things can get.

468
00:20:43,558 --> 00:20:44,708
- Be careful of those.

469
00:20:44,718 --> 00:20:45,757
They killed Bobby Darin.

470
00:20:45,758 --> 00:20:53,758
- The final round is when
you play for the Dewey.

471
00:21:35,788 --> 00:21:37,758
Breaking a tie is complicated.

472
00:21:37,768 --> 00:21:38,778
- Get the hats.

473
00:21:38,788 --> 00:21:42,113
You throw cards into a hat,
and whichever you sink,

474
00:21:42,114 --> 00:21:43,638
you score like a poker hand.

475
00:21:58,638 --> 00:21:59,678
- Straight flush.

476
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:06,668
- I'm just saying,
what if he loses?

477
00:22:06,678 --> 00:22:07,668
- I'm a Traveler.

478
00:22:07,678 --> 00:22:09,638
I'll grab the coin
and blip away.

479
00:22:09,648 --> 00:22:11,678
- Yeah, and then the
people you just robbed

480
00:22:11,688 --> 00:22:13,638
hunt you down and torture you.

481
00:22:13,648 --> 00:22:15,698
So why don't we save
that for plan B?

482
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:20,728
- Listen, if you lose
this last hand, it's over.

483
00:22:20,738 --> 00:22:24,738
I think we need to
be ready for plan B.

484
00:22:41,618 --> 00:22:43,658
- What is the point
of this display?

485
00:22:45,638 --> 00:22:53,108
You've used up all the
ambient magic in the room.

486
00:22:58,688 --> 00:23:02,258
- I guess we'll just have
to play an honest game.

487
00:23:24,638 --> 00:23:25,173
Got it.

488
00:23:25,174 --> 00:23:25,708
- Perfect.

489
00:23:25,718 --> 00:23:26,748
Now the easy part.

490
00:23:26,758 --> 00:23:29,528
Borrow a Black Card
to use as a template.

491
00:23:31,698 --> 00:23:32,718
- Anything?

492
00:23:32,719 --> 00:23:33,738
- No.

493
00:23:35,788 --> 00:23:37,698
Why are we going
along with this?

494
00:23:39,508 --> 00:23:40,748
Marina killed my mother.

495
00:23:40,758 --> 00:23:42,538
- That was a different Marina.

496
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:44,618
- How different?

497
00:23:44,638 --> 00:23:46,678
Are we just gonna hand
her a nuclear bomb?

498
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:48,518
- What's the alternative?

499
00:23:48,528 --> 00:23:50,538
- We use it against her.

500
00:23:50,548 --> 00:23:52,698
- Where does that end?

501
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:55,618
I'm... I came here to get away
from that kind of shit.

502
00:23:55,638 --> 00:23:57,668
- You know, I'm
getting really sick

503
00:23:57,678 --> 00:23:59,518
of being the voice in
the back of the room

504
00:23:59,528 --> 00:24:01,668
that everyone ignores.

505
00:24:01,678 --> 00:24:04,718
The other me, Sam, did whatever

506
00:24:04,719 --> 00:24:06,678
she thought was right,
regardless of what

507
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:07,638
anybody else thought.

508
00:24:07,648 --> 00:24:11,658
- I get it... because
where I came from,

509
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,548
everyone I cared about is dead.

510
00:24:13,788 --> 00:24:15,748
No other voice to
listen to but mine.

511
00:24:16,758 --> 00:24:19,778
But maybe Sam didn't care
what anyone else thought

512
00:24:19,788 --> 00:24:21,538
because she was alone.

513
00:24:22,668 --> 00:24:23,788
You aren't.

514
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:30,708
- Whoa.

515
00:24:30,718 --> 00:24:32,638
I got something here.

516
00:24:32,648 --> 00:24:35,728
There's huge energy
coming off her purse.

517
00:24:35,738 --> 00:24:37,678
It's gotta be the
Black Card in there.

518
00:24:37,688 --> 00:24:38,658
- Showtime.

519
00:24:42,668 --> 00:24:43,778
Oh, excuse me, I'm...

520
00:24:44,758 --> 00:24:45,788
I'm... I'm sorry.

521
00:24:46,508 --> 00:24:47,611
Do I know you from somewhere?

522
00:24:47,618 --> 00:24:49,788
- I mean, I dabbled in acting.

523
00:24:50,508 --> 00:24:52,638
- What have I seen you in?

524
00:24:52,648 --> 00:24:56,688
Let's just say some
provocative films of the 1970s.

525
00:24:56,698 --> 00:24:58,658
- Interesting.

526
00:25:14,748 --> 00:25:15,778
- All finished.

527
00:25:15,788 --> 00:25:16,738
- Great.

528
00:25:16,739 --> 00:25:17,688
Let's go.

529
00:25:17,698 --> 00:25:19,688
- Uh, there is one little thing.

530
00:25:19,698 --> 00:25:22,507
That special sauce I was
talking about before.

531
00:25:22,508 --> 00:25:24,768
Most forgers use
complicated illusion work.

532
00:25:24,778 --> 00:25:27,518
That's not quite my thing.

533
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:39,788
- Did a bird just
bring you a sandwich?

534
00:25:40,508 --> 00:25:41,738
- Yeah, I guess she did.

535
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:43,578
You want it?

536
00:25:43,588 --> 00:25:45,638
- Well, I mean, yeah, but...

537
00:25:45,648 --> 00:25:47,528
- But what the fuck, Franky?

538
00:25:47,538 --> 00:25:48,661
- This is what
I'm talking about.

539
00:25:48,668 --> 00:25:50,518
Luck is my discipline.

540
00:25:50,528 --> 00:25:51,761
The forgeries I make give
whoever's holding them

541
00:25:51,768 --> 00:25:53,638
insanely good luck.

542
00:25:53,648 --> 00:25:54,761
So nobody even bothers to check

543
00:25:54,768 --> 00:25:56,638
if the thing is fake.

544
00:25:56,648 --> 00:25:58,072
I've done the spellwork
so many times,

545
00:25:58,508 --> 00:26:00,558
I'm just sort of
encrusted with it.

546
00:26:00,568 --> 00:26:02,778
Luck is zero-sum,
so all that bad luck

547
00:26:02,788 --> 00:26:04,648
has got to go somewhere.

548
00:26:08,508 --> 00:26:09,698
- It goes into a bear?

549
00:26:09,708 --> 00:26:12,658
- Somebody, not me,
has to hold that

550
00:26:12,668 --> 00:26:14,088
while the others bring

551
00:26:14,089 --> 00:26:15,507
the Black Card to the Library.

552
00:26:15,508 --> 00:26:18,748
And whoever's holding it
is gonna have a bad day.

553
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:20,193
- I'll do it.

554
00:26:20,194 --> 00:26:20,708
- No, Jules.

555
00:26:20,718 --> 00:26:22,568
You don't have to. He...
- It's... it's okay.

556
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:28,548
It's hard to explain, but
I'm kind of bulletproof.

557
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:30,508
If anybody should
have terrible luck,

558
00:26:30,518 --> 00:26:31,668
it should be me.

559
00:26:31,678 --> 00:26:32,708
- Why are you bulletproof?

560
00:26:32,718 --> 00:26:34,788
- That's none of your business.

561
00:26:35,508 --> 00:26:36,698
- Pick it up.

562
00:26:43,728 --> 00:26:46,658
No, no, no, no, no,
no, something's wrong.

563
00:26:46,668 --> 00:26:48,598
Uh, whatever "none
of my business" shit

564
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:49,671
is going on with
you, it's interfering

565
00:26:49,678 --> 00:26:52,518
with the fortune
spell, so set it down.

566
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:53,538
Set it down!

567
00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:54,548
- All right.

568
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:55,598
Dahh...

569
00:26:57,548 --> 00:26:59,558
- Looks like you
just volunteered.

570
00:27:11,758 --> 00:27:12,728
- You awake?

571
00:27:12,738 --> 00:27:14,558
- Nope.

572
00:27:14,568 --> 00:27:20,078
- It's time.

573
00:27:55,588 --> 00:27:58,558
- Anti-magic paint
on a magic lock.

574
00:27:58,568 --> 00:27:59,741
Wish I had thought
of that before those

575
00:27:59,748 --> 00:28:02,507
book-sniffing bastards
ruined Christmas.

576
00:28:02,508 --> 00:28:03,588
- Shh.

577
00:28:07,758 --> 00:28:09,578
- Which way now?

578
00:28:09,588 --> 00:28:10,731
- I don't know.
- Something isn't right.

579
00:28:10,738 --> 00:28:12,708
This should continue straight.

580
00:28:13,748 --> 00:28:16,778
- Well, you made this map by
mind-controlling a cockroach.

581
00:28:16,788 --> 00:28:20,708
Shouldn't we trust our eyes
rather than some shit-eating bug?

582
00:28:22,748 --> 00:28:24,718
- No, I think it's an illusion.

583
00:28:24,728 --> 00:28:26,608
There's spellwork on this wall.

584
00:28:39,578 --> 00:28:40,718
- Or it's a wall.

585
00:28:55,778 --> 00:28:57,183
- This is it.

586
00:28:57,184 --> 00:28:58,588
The books of everyone.

587
00:28:58,598 --> 00:29:00,752
- You look for yours, and I'll
- go look for my friends'.

588
00:29:02,548 --> 00:29:07,538
I gotta tell you, it is such a
relief to take off that Ember disguise.

589
00:29:07,548 --> 00:29:08,757
So what have I been
missing down on Earth?

590
00:29:08,758 --> 00:29:10,507
It must be bad.

591
00:29:10,508 --> 00:29:12,578
Your chakras are all fucked up.

592
00:29:12,588 --> 00:29:13,768
- Oh, yeah.

593
00:29:13,778 --> 00:29:16,598
Uh, we got magic turned back on.

594
00:29:16,608 --> 00:29:17,548
- Hey.

595
00:29:17,558 --> 00:29:20,163
- And, you know,
one of our friends

596
00:29:20,164 --> 00:29:21,568
just betrayed us...

597
00:29:22,508 --> 00:29:27,507
Which is crazy, right?
Like, who would do that?

598
00:29:27,508 --> 00:29:28,618
- Yeah.
- I got mind wiped.

599
00:29:28,638 --> 00:29:33,558
Yeah, I was living as this other
dude named Isaac for months.

600
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:37,143
- Um... that is
exactly kind of close

601
00:29:37,144 --> 00:29:38,518
to my situation.

602
00:29:38,758 --> 00:29:42,638
So I'm being hunted by
this douchebag monster,

603
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:44,757
and, like, I need a
place to crash, right?

604
00:29:44,758 --> 00:29:47,598
That's when I remember
that squirrely little

605
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:50,788
human friend of yours
said that he killed Ember,

606
00:29:51,508 --> 00:29:53,578
and I'm like, "I could
take that guy's place."

607
00:29:53,588 --> 00:29:55,708
Live to fuck another
day, you know?

608
00:29:55,718 --> 00:29:57,558
- It's kind of nice, you know?

609
00:29:57,568 --> 00:29:59,588
Freeing to... to live as

610
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:01,608
someone else for a little bit.

611
00:30:01,618 --> 00:30:03,558
- Yeah, I guess.

612
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:07,568
You know, a famous
cocksman once told me,

613
00:30:07,578 --> 00:30:10,588
"Once you've had quantity,
the only thing left

614
00:30:10,589 --> 00:30:11,658
is strange."

615
00:30:12,708 --> 00:30:15,668
And, boy, is this
place full of strange.

616
00:30:15,678 --> 00:30:18,648
- I mean, Isaac's
life was great.

617
00:30:18,658 --> 00:30:22,728
Lot of friends,
big, uh... family.

618
00:30:24,608 --> 00:30:27,518
But eventually,
it... it all ends,

619
00:30:27,528 --> 00:30:31,768
and your old life,
your old problems,

620
00:30:31,778 --> 00:30:33,568
they catch up to you.

621
00:30:33,578 --> 00:30:34,771
- Or your problems
never find you

622
00:30:34,778 --> 00:30:36,658
and the party goes on forever.

623
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,738
Oh, look at that, I'm dry.

624
00:30:39,748 --> 00:30:42,738
Is that... did you make for me?

625
00:30:42,748 --> 00:30:43,763
- Yes.

626
00:30:43,764 --> 00:30:44,778
- Josh special?

627
00:30:44,788 --> 00:30:46,213
- Uh, yes.

628
00:30:46,214 --> 00:30:47,638
I... I made it for you.

629
00:30:47,648 --> 00:30:51,757
- You and me, Joshy,
we're the same.

630
00:30:51,758 --> 00:30:54,518
We're born to be
the perfect hosts.

631
00:30:54,528 --> 00:30:57,578
We want everyone around
us to have a good time.

632
00:30:57,588 --> 00:30:58,778
We make sure of it.

633
00:30:58,788 --> 00:31:01,508
Nobody does the same for us.

634
00:31:01,518 --> 00:31:02,548
Mm-mm.

635
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:04,768
This is to Josh, not to Isaac.

636
00:31:04,778 --> 00:31:08,578
This is to the real you.

637
00:31:12,508 --> 00:31:13,558
- I'm sorry.

638
00:31:13,568 --> 00:31:16,547
I... I pee-peed in
it, and you don't...

639
00:31:16,548 --> 00:31:18,588
You don't drink that.

640
00:31:18,598 --> 00:31:19,688
So...

641
00:31:21,748 --> 00:31:25,518
- This the dumbest plan.

642
00:31:25,528 --> 00:31:27,538
- Franky says the
disguises won't matter.

643
00:31:27,548 --> 00:31:30,638
If the Black Card works,
nobody will question them.

644
00:31:30,648 --> 00:31:32,578
- I feel like an idiot.

645
00:31:32,588 --> 00:31:33,788
- Excuse me, sir.

646
00:31:34,508 --> 00:31:35,768
- You have a fresh look.

647
00:31:35,778 --> 00:31:37,668
Have you considered modeling?

648
00:31:40,778 --> 00:31:43,538
- Kay, it's just soup.

649
00:31:44,598 --> 00:31:45,618
Can't choke.

650
00:31:45,619 --> 00:31:46,638
It's not scalding.

651
00:31:46,648 --> 00:31:48,507
It's totally safe.

652
00:31:48,508 --> 00:31:53,188
- Oh, look at that line.

653
00:31:53,189 --> 00:31:54,678
This is gonna take forever.

654
00:31:54,688 --> 00:31:57,678
I've been thinking, while we're
here, we should get a bit extra.

655
00:31:57,688 --> 00:32:01,588
Five for Marina, five
for Franky, ten for us.

656
00:32:01,598 --> 00:32:04,528
- We'd have to be insanely
lucky to get that much.

657
00:32:04,538 --> 00:32:06,553
The more luck we get,

658
00:32:06,554 --> 00:32:08,568
the more bad luck Quentin gets.

659
00:32:08,578 --> 00:32:09,771
- When this is over,
the McAllisters

660
00:32:09,778 --> 00:32:11,748
will still be after us.

661
00:32:11,758 --> 00:32:16,588
We'll need to do some
major cloaking spell.

662
00:32:16,598 --> 00:32:18,507
- It could kill him.

663
00:32:18,508 --> 00:32:19,533
- Hey!

664
00:32:19,534 --> 00:32:21,758
There's a truck outside
giving out free ice cream!

665
00:32:23,668 --> 00:32:26,708
- I mean, two extra
coins can't hurt.

666
00:32:26,718 --> 00:32:30,563
- It's... it's all good.

667
00:32:30,564 --> 00:32:31,578
Soup spills all the time.

668
00:32:31,588 --> 00:32:33,578
- Thanks.

669
00:32:33,588 --> 00:32:35,588
Damn it.

670
00:32:35,598 --> 00:32:37,093
How the hell do you get

671
00:32:37,094 --> 00:32:38,588
a paper cut from a paper towel?

672
00:32:38,598 --> 00:32:39,628
- Welcome.

673
00:32:39,629 --> 00:32:40,658
- Hi.

674
00:32:40,668 --> 00:32:44,528
- So how can I help you today?

675
00:32:44,538 --> 00:32:46,708
- We need twelve
contained current coins.

676
00:32:50,618 --> 00:32:51,658
- Here.

677
00:32:51,659 --> 00:32:52,698
- No, God.

678
00:32:52,708 --> 00:32:53,698
Keep it away.

679
00:32:55,688 --> 00:32:58,718
- Everything looks in order.

680
00:32:58,728 --> 00:33:02,008
Just need to check
one little thing.

681
00:33:09,778 --> 00:33:12,508
Shoot.

682
00:33:14,758 --> 00:33:16,558
Did you hear something?

683
00:33:16,568 --> 00:33:20,538
- Where did it come from?

684
00:33:20,548 --> 00:33:22,648
- Out of the... toilet.

685
00:33:22,658 --> 00:33:24,658
- All right, then, I'll
send this requisition

686
00:33:24,668 --> 00:33:28,018
to the home office, and
they'll return your coins.

687
00:33:35,538 --> 00:33:40,038
- I thought you said your
phone wasn't working.

688
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:46,688
- It's a voicemail from my mom.

689
00:33:46,698 --> 00:33:49,698
Do you think... - Q.

690
00:33:49,708 --> 00:33:51,548
- It's got to be about my dad.

691
00:33:49,708 --> 00:33:52,558
I'm not gonna... -
No, Q, the bear.

692
00:33:56,548 --> 00:33:58,558
- Okay.

693
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:04,588
Oh.

694
00:34:04,598 --> 00:34:07,533
Your request has been
flagged for follow-up

695
00:34:07,534 --> 00:34:08,537
with a supervisor.

696
00:34:08,538 --> 00:34:09,618
Wait here, please.

697
00:34:14,658 --> 00:34:16,538
A requisition follow-up for you.

698
00:34:16,558 --> 00:34:18,618
- Christ, can it wait?

699
00:34:18,638 --> 00:34:19,138
Fine.

700
00:34:36,618 --> 00:34:38,638
- Sorry, I can't see for shit.

701
00:34:38,658 --> 00:34:43,711
This bloody thing's
making me crazy.

702
00:34:43,718 --> 00:34:44,668
Do you mind?

703
00:34:44,669 --> 00:34:45,618
- No.

704
00:34:45,638 --> 00:34:46,678
Do... do your thing.

705
00:34:46,698 --> 00:34:49,677
- What do I do?

706
00:34:49,678 --> 00:34:51,718
- Just, please,
don't listen to it

707
00:34:51,738 --> 00:34:53,677
until we hear back
from Penny and Katie.

708
00:34:53,678 --> 00:34:57,537
- Oh, shit!

709
00:34:57,538 --> 00:35:00,597
- Oh, Jesus Christ, now
I've got it in backwards.

710
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:05,538
- About those coins.

711
00:35:05,558 --> 00:35:07,597
- Listen, the truth is,

712
00:35:07,598 --> 00:35:10,193
the red tape, the
paperwork, it's, in my mind,

713
00:35:10,194 --> 00:35:11,617
all just a wank.

714
00:35:11,618 --> 00:35:12,717
You guys gonna
blow yourselves up?

715
00:35:12,718 --> 00:35:13,638
- No.

716
00:35:13,639 --> 00:35:14,557
- No?

717
00:35:14,558 --> 00:35:15,697
Great.

718
00:35:15,698 --> 00:35:19,638
Requested... approved.

719
00:35:21,768 --> 00:35:26,658
- Sorry about the inconvenience.

720
00:35:26,678 --> 00:35:27,668
- Thank you very much.

721
00:35:27,669 --> 00:35:30,578
You have a good day.

722
00:35:31,638 --> 00:35:33,578
- Jesus, shit.

723
00:35:34,598 --> 00:35:35,983
- Okay, they did it.
- Drop the bear!

724
00:35:38,768 --> 00:35:41,698
- It really came out of the...
- I don't want

725
00:35:41,699 --> 00:35:42,658
to talk about it.

726
00:35:46,538 --> 00:35:47,346
- Thank you, brother.

727
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:49,597
- I had a feeling
things would work out,

728
00:35:49,598 --> 00:35:51,638
because they always do.

729
00:35:51,658 --> 00:35:53,617
By the way, I'd
destroy those ASAP.

730
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:55,728
They'll be out of juice
soon, but you don't want

731
00:35:55,729 --> 00:35:56,758
to take any chances.

732
00:35:56,768 --> 00:35:57,584
- I'm on it.

733
00:36:11,698 --> 00:36:14,578
- You nutsacked out, didn't you?

734
00:36:15,618 --> 00:36:17,128
Oh, well, "pussied out"

735
00:36:17,129 --> 00:36:18,638
makes perfect sense here?

736
00:36:19,578 --> 00:36:21,651
- Well, if you mean that
- I couldn't go through with it,

737
00:36:21,658 --> 00:36:23,578
Then, yes, you're right.

738
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:27,557
- Josh, we don't
have a choice here.

739
00:36:27,558 --> 00:36:29,738
Now, where is the
rest of the Ambrosia?

740
00:36:31,698 --> 00:36:33,637
- Fine, but just
know that Bacchus

741
00:36:33,638 --> 00:36:34,767
will never drink
anything you give him.

742
00:36:34,768 --> 00:36:37,598
- Oh, I'm not gonna
give it to Bacchus.

743
00:36:37,618 --> 00:36:38,731
Yeah, I'm gonna
dump it in there.

744
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,658
Everyone'll drink it.

745
00:36:40,678 --> 00:36:42,718
- Are you nuts?
- There are over 100 people here.

746
00:36:42,738 --> 00:36:44,767
You have no idea what
that will do to them.

747
00:36:44,768 --> 00:36:47,697
- Well, I'm pretty sure
it'll fucking kill them.

748
00:36:47,698 --> 00:36:50,578
And I'll do it, unless
you start acting

749
00:36:50,598 --> 00:36:54,178
like a real pussy and take one

750
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:55,758
for the fucking team.

751
00:36:57,698 --> 00:37:00,738
- Hey, uh, I'm sorry about...

752
00:37:00,758 --> 00:37:04,578
- We've all peed in
things we regret.

753
00:37:06,598 --> 00:37:08,638
- I know gods are supposed

754
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:10,678
to be distant and unknowable,

755
00:37:10,698 --> 00:37:12,658
but you're a good guy.

756
00:37:15,678 --> 00:37:17,598
- I want to tell you a secret.

757
00:37:18,738 --> 00:37:25,618
What did you put... in this?

758
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,657
- I found my book.

759
00:37:30,658 --> 00:37:31,737
Now let's get the
hell out of here.

760
00:37:31,738 --> 00:37:33,618
- I can't find my
friends' books.

761
00:37:34,698 --> 00:37:36,717
"The following books have been"

762
00:37:36,718 --> 00:37:39,578
removed from circulation
for revisions.

763
00:37:36,738 --> 00:37:39,578
"Q. Coldwater, A. Quinn."

764
00:37:40,618 --> 00:37:42,737
They're filling in the
endings of our books...

765
00:37:42,738 --> 00:37:45,148
the pages that were missing
because of the Great

766
00:37:45,149 --> 00:37:45,718
Blank Spot.

767
00:37:53,718 --> 00:37:54,738
Nick?

768
00:37:56,698 --> 00:37:58,737
- Hey, I'm sorry about
your friends' books,

769
00:37:58,738 --> 00:38:00,758
but this is our chance.

770
00:38:00,768 --> 00:38:02,183
Come with me.

771
00:38:02,184 --> 00:38:03,598
- I can't.

772
00:38:03,618 --> 00:38:05,698
I... I can't leave
without their books.

773
00:38:05,718 --> 00:38:08,658
- Well, I want to do the...
- Look, just go, while

774
00:38:08,659 --> 00:38:09,659
you still have the chance.

775
00:38:09,678 --> 00:38:11,718
Okay, I can find the
Revision Room on my own.

776
00:38:13,658 --> 00:38:21,658
For what it's worth,
you're still on my Nice List.

777
00:38:37,508 --> 00:38:38,788
- The fuck?

778
00:38:54,638 --> 00:38:58,677
- Do you remember me?

779
00:38:58,678 --> 00:39:01,677
Because I don't.

780
00:39:01,678 --> 00:39:06,618
I don't remember my name
or where I came from.

781
00:39:06,638 --> 00:39:10,557
But I remember you.

782
00:39:10,558 --> 00:39:14,508
You took something from
me, something important,

783
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:17,787
and then you...
threw me in a cage,

784
00:39:17,788 --> 00:39:22,578
and I would like
for you to explain.

785
00:39:22,598 --> 00:39:26,618
- You remember all that,
but you don't remember

786
00:39:26,619 --> 00:39:29,698
what you are, what you did.

787
00:39:29,718 --> 00:39:31,767
The word "monster"
has been thrown around.

788
00:39:31,768 --> 00:39:33,718
- That's right.

789
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:36,598
We put you with the
rest of your kind.

790
00:39:37,598 --> 00:39:38,767
- And I ate them.

791
00:39:38,768 --> 00:39:41,677
- You're kind of making
my case for me here.

792
00:39:41,678 --> 00:39:43,787
- We have the same parents.

793
00:39:43,788 --> 00:39:46,637
Why am I a monster
and you're a god?

794
00:39:46,638 --> 00:39:49,768
If you don't want
to be a monster, then let me go.

795
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:52,678
Give me back what you took from me,
and maybe I will.

796
00:39:52,698 --> 00:39:57,597
- I can't... ever.

797
00:39:57,598 --> 00:39:58,738
I'm sorry.

798
00:39:59,788 --> 00:40:05,638
- It was a part of me, and
now it's a part of you.

799
00:40:05,658 --> 00:40:11,787
Burning in your body.

800
00:40:11,788 --> 00:40:13,678
- Wait. Wait.

801
00:40:13,698 --> 00:40:15,698
This world needs me.

802
00:40:15,718 --> 00:40:17,698
Its god is dead.

803
00:40:17,718 --> 00:40:19,677
You don't have to do this.

804
00:40:19,678 --> 00:40:20,708
There's others.

805
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:21,738
There's still time.

806
00:40:21,758 --> 00:40:23,718
We can figure something out.

807
00:40:23,738 --> 00:40:25,577
It doesn't have to be me.

808
00:40:25,578 --> 00:40:27,788
It doesn't have to...

809
00:40:45,718 --> 00:40:50,538
- What the fuck did he
just rip out of him?

810
00:40:50,558 --> 00:40:52,538
Whatever it is, to a fairy eye,

811
00:40:52,558 --> 00:40:55,618
it's like staring
straight at the sun.

812
00:40:58,658 --> 00:40:59,718
- They're real.

813
00:41:01,638 --> 00:41:03,508
- Well, it's been a pleasure.

814
00:41:04,638 --> 00:41:06,538
- The trackers on us?

815
00:41:06,558 --> 00:41:07,787
- Not actually a thing.

816
00:41:07,788 --> 00:41:10,538
You guys are too lawful
good to bitch out.

817
00:41:19,558 --> 00:41:20,548
- Marina.

818
00:41:20,549 --> 00:41:21,538
- Hmm?

819
00:41:21,558 --> 00:41:23,538
- I've been looking for you.

820
00:41:27,738 --> 00:41:29,557
- Excuse me, miss.

821
00:41:29,558 --> 00:41:30,711
These are free to a good home.

822
00:41:30,718 --> 00:41:32,518
Are you interested?

823
00:41:37,698 --> 00:41:39,658
- Hey, are you sure
Marina's apartment's

824
00:41:39,678 --> 00:41:41,517
the safest place for us to meet?

825
00:41:41,518 --> 00:41:42,768
- It's not Marina's.

826
00:41:43,718 --> 00:41:44,767
It's mine.

827
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:46,508
- What did you do?

828
00:41:46,518 --> 00:41:47,677
- I handled the problem.

829
00:41:47,678 --> 00:41:50,637
Now, can we do
this cloaking spell

830
00:41:50,638 --> 00:41:52,638
before the McAllisters
show up and kill all of us?

831
00:41:56,718 --> 00:41:58,598
- Hey.

832
00:41:58,618 --> 00:42:00,657
You haven't listened?

833
00:42:00,658 --> 00:42:03,767
You know, your bad luck's gone.

834
00:42:03,768 --> 00:42:06,558
Safe as it'll ever be.

835
00:42:06,578 --> 00:42:10,657
But that's not what's
really stopping you.

836
00:42:10,658 --> 00:42:15,637
- The other me...
Brian, his dad died

837
00:42:15,638 --> 00:42:17,758
when he was a kid.

838
00:42:18,758 --> 00:42:21,678
He was too little
to even understand.

839
00:42:22,558 --> 00:42:24,658
All of his problems
were like that.

840
00:42:24,678 --> 00:42:26,537
No sharp edges.

841
00:42:26,538 --> 00:42:27,538
- Yeah.

842
00:42:28,698 --> 00:42:30,768
- Look at us.

843
00:42:30,788 --> 00:42:33,578
We paid a hell of
a fucking price.

844
00:42:35,508 --> 00:42:37,558
You gave up being a goddess.

845
00:42:39,738 --> 00:42:41,718
I gave up my father.

846
00:42:46,738 --> 00:42:48,678
What did we get in return?

847
00:42:49,678 --> 00:42:50,698
- Magic is back.

848
00:42:55,678 --> 00:42:57,788
Mm-mm, not in the
way that we wanted.

849
00:42:58,508 --> 00:43:03,737
How are you not furious?

850
00:43:07,508 --> 00:43:11,738
Because, for almost everyone,
the world is a little brighter,

851
00:43:11,758 --> 00:43:15,637
even if they never know why.

852
00:43:15,638 --> 00:43:18,698
I hate the Library
for what they did,

853
00:43:18,718 --> 00:43:22,738
but my part in it,
I knew what it cost.

854
00:43:22,758 --> 00:43:26,767
And I'd do it again.

855
00:43:31,598 --> 00:43:32,788
But you wouldn't.

856
00:43:33,508 --> 00:43:38,737
- Will you sit
here for a minute?

857
00:43:38,738 --> 00:43:40,517
- Yeah.

858
00:43:40,518 --> 00:43:46,578
- Hi, Quentin.

859
00:43:46,598 --> 00:43:49,557
Sorry to leave a
message with bad news.

860
00:43:49,558 --> 00:43:53,598
I need to talk to you
about your father.
