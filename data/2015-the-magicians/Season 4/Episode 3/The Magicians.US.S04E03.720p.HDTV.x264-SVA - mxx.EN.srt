"The Magicians"...

2
00:00:01,633 --> 00:00:03,157
A-Are you Santa Claus?

3
00:00:03,243 --> 00:00:05,360
Oh, I'm not... not that.

4
00:00:05,454 --> 00:00:06,508
Magic's gone.

5
00:00:06,594 --> 00:00:07,883
I'm not a magician,

6
00:00:07,969 --> 00:00:09,446
but I could feel it
when it was gone,

7
00:00:09,532 --> 00:00:11,040
and I knew it wasn't
a coincidence

8
00:00:11,126 --> 00:00:13,555
when... I went into remission
a week later.

9
00:00:13,641 --> 00:00:15,000
What timeline are you from?

10
00:00:15,086 --> 00:00:16,672
The one where you
owe me child support.

11
00:00:16,758 --> 00:00:17,766
I'm kidding.

12
00:00:17,852 --> 00:00:19,275
Kay, then if you want me
to help these students,

13
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,618
can you tell me
who they are?

14
00:00:20,704 --> 00:00:22,899
Their lives were
in grave danger.

15
00:00:23,002 --> 00:00:24,336
I cast a spell that

16
00:00:24,422 --> 00:00:26,532
erased their identities
and gave them new ones.

17
00:00:26,618 --> 00:00:27,970
I mean, isn't there anything
you can do?

18
00:00:28,055 --> 00:00:30,030
If I reveal that the spell
can be reversed,

19
00:00:30,116 --> 00:00:31,743
then someone would reverse
the spell.

20
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:39,336
Bacchus,
what are you doing here?

21
00:00:39,422 --> 00:00:41,103
Why do you want everyone
thinking you're Ember?

22
00:00:41,188 --> 00:00:42,336
Thanks for popping in.

23
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,075
Oh, my God.

24
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:46,399
Mis hermanos.

25
00:00:46,485 --> 00:00:48,446
Where were you?
We... we looked everywhere...

26
00:00:48,532 --> 00:00:49,844
- Stay back.
- Why?

27
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,993
Because I'm not here to play.

28
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:55,672
Marina.

29
00:00:56,466 --> 00:00:58,915
Why do you look like
you're fleeing something?

30
00:00:59,249 --> 00:01:02,074
It's me, Margo,
previously known as Janet.

31
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,383
Look,
I'm gonna do you a solid.

32
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:06,282
Don't go up there.
Why?

33
00:01:06,368 --> 00:01:08,782
Because there's an uninvited
guest in my apartment

34
00:01:08,868 --> 00:01:11,250
who's probably killing
your friends right about now.

35
00:01:11,336 --> 00:01:13,774
Look, I don't know what he is,
and I'm assuming it's a "he"

36
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,586
because this is some
toxically masculine behavior,

37
00:01:16,672 --> 00:01:19,587
but he walked through
every ward and shield I had,

38
00:01:19,733 --> 00:01:21,188
set off every alarm.

39
00:01:21,274 --> 00:01:22,860
So instead of going inside,

40
00:01:23,022 --> 00:01:24,610
I'm gonna get
a breakfast burrito.

41
00:01:24,696 --> 00:01:25,621
You wanna join?

42
00:01:25,707 --> 00:01:27,461
We have to help them.

43
00:01:27,547 --> 00:01:29,758
Oh, you're one of those.

44
00:01:29,873 --> 00:01:31,907
Fine, you wanna
stick your neck out?

45
00:01:31,993 --> 00:01:33,878
There's something inside
that can help you.

46
00:01:33,987 --> 00:01:35,897
Do tell.

47
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,125
No traveling.

48
00:01:39,304 --> 00:01:40,586
Where to start?

49
00:01:40,705 --> 00:01:42,930
Order is important
with these things.

50
00:01:43,016 --> 00:01:45,941
Who goes first?
Who goes last?

51
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:48,180
Oh, you keep looking at him...

52
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,040
Because you don't
want him to die?

53
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:54,074
Which means
he has to go before you.

54
00:01:56,391 --> 00:01:58,610
You care about all of them.

55
00:01:59,011 --> 00:02:00,305
So you're last.

56
00:02:04,594 --> 00:02:05,727
Thank Christ.

57
00:02:05,813 --> 00:02:06,954
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

58
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:09,243
Not... Eliot.

59
00:02:09,342 --> 00:02:12,172
This thing
has God-level power,

60
00:02:12,516 --> 00:02:14,274
and I have a bad history
with Gods,

61
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,594
since apparently one killed me.

62
00:02:16,935 --> 00:02:18,032
No, it's fine.

63
00:02:18,118 --> 00:02:19,212
Different me,
but I didn't want

64
00:02:19,297 --> 00:02:20,618
to get caught off guard again,

65
00:02:20,704 --> 00:02:23,084
so, I called in
every favor I had

66
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,790
to build a defense system.

67
00:02:24,876 --> 00:02:27,641
All you have to do is get him
to sit in the gold chair.

68
00:02:27,727 --> 00:02:29,047
Why the gold chair?

69
00:02:29,133 --> 00:02:30,516
Because it had
to be something,

70
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,212
and everybody wants to sit
in the gold chair.

71
00:02:32,297 --> 00:02:33,905
It's total power move.

72
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,610
I'm so glad you came.

73
00:02:36,696 --> 00:02:38,953
Saves me
having to hunt you down.

74
00:02:39,227 --> 00:02:42,032
I've got so much of that
ahead of me already.

75
00:02:42,274 --> 00:02:44,085
What is he talking about?

76
00:02:44,508 --> 00:02:46,813
He's, uh, hunting Gods.

77
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,633
It's vengeance
for locking you in the castle.

78
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:52,079
They did more than that,

79
00:02:52,316 --> 00:02:53,930
and so did you.

80
00:02:54,914 --> 00:02:56,688
You tried to kill me.

81
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,391
You were all part of it.

82
00:03:07,196 --> 00:03:08,789
Then what?

83
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,656
There's a bell on the table.

84
00:03:10,742 --> 00:03:11,969
Ring it.

85
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,430
And he explodes?

86
00:03:15,518 --> 00:03:17,363
He gets a face full
of distilled ambrosia.

87
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:19,430
It's basically meth for Gods.

88
00:03:19,586 --> 00:03:21,095
Its gets them high,
but an overdose

89
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,617
will knock them
on their asses.

90
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:27,602
Tell me Eliot
is still in there somewhere.

91
00:03:27,688 --> 00:03:29,141
Not that I've seen.

92
00:03:29,547 --> 00:03:31,946
Your round, innocent face

93
00:03:32,032 --> 00:03:34,406
will make your death
particularly upsetting,

94
00:03:34,694 --> 00:03:36,519
so I've decided
to start with you.

95
00:03:39,962 --> 00:03:41,817
I can give you Bacchus.

96
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,440
You're hunting Gods,

97
00:03:46,908 --> 00:03:49,913
and I found him hiding
someplace far away.

98
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,696
Hiding from you, right?

99
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:56,258
I can take you there...

100
00:03:56,922 --> 00:03:58,578
if you let them live.

101
00:04:00,391 --> 00:04:01,774
All of them.

102
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,406
Perhaps we can be friends
after all.

So where is everyone else?

107
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:28,829
I don't know.

108
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:31,019
They were supposed
to remain hidden.

109
00:04:33,031 --> 00:04:35,061
I meant to protect you.

110
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,733
Doesn't really seem
like I need protection.

111
00:04:40,038 --> 00:04:41,701
I mean, nothing
your spell threw at me

112
00:04:41,787 --> 00:04:43,022
even left a scratch.

113
00:04:43,162 --> 00:04:45,615
Reynard did say,
even without their powers,

114
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:47,272
Gods are hard to kill.

115
00:04:47,846 --> 00:04:52,611
I wouldn't underestimate
the will of Irene McAllister.

116
00:04:53,264 --> 00:04:54,662
Huh.

117
00:04:54,976 --> 00:04:56,834
Tell a few people
that you're leaving forever,

118
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,928
and look what
the ungrateful bastards do.

119
00:05:00,936 --> 00:05:02,303
Nice.

120
00:05:03,451 --> 00:05:04,928
You know,
if the deal is broken

121
00:05:05,048 --> 00:05:06,115
and the McAllisters
are coming,

122
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,951
I'm gonna
have to warn everyone.

123
00:05:08,037 --> 00:05:11,942
Contacting your friends will
put a target on their backs.

124
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,701
To be clear,

125
00:05:13,867 --> 00:05:16,475
you put the target
on our backs.

126
00:05:16,703 --> 00:05:18,638
You betrayed us.

127
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:20,022
Hmm.

128
00:05:20,428 --> 00:05:23,061
I sacrificed everything
to bring back magic.

129
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:25,725
You know what I sacrificed,

130
00:05:26,054 --> 00:05:27,804
and look what you do with it.

131
00:05:28,613 --> 00:05:32,303
Yes, Ms. Wicker,

132
00:05:32,972 --> 00:05:37,811
I made a deal
with the Goddamn Library,

133
00:05:38,264 --> 00:05:41,514
and in doing so,
I saved your lives.

134
00:05:41,671 --> 00:05:43,587
Yeah, well, you're pretty
fucking quick to compromise,

135
00:05:43,672 --> 00:05:44,795
you know that?

136
00:05:46,081 --> 00:05:49,209
Now, I need to find my friends,
but I can't do magic,

137
00:05:49,381 --> 00:05:52,053
so you're going to cast
the locator spell for me.

138
00:06:13,118 --> 00:06:15,124
Dean Fogg. Finally.

139
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,140
I only have a moment.

140
00:06:18,869 --> 00:06:20,190
You know how the Library

141
00:06:20,276 --> 00:06:23,580
contains the books of everyone
who ever lived?

142
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:24,760
Yeah.

143
00:06:24,955 --> 00:06:27,611
The Great Blank Spot is over.

144
00:06:27,783 --> 00:06:29,828
The Library can update
their books again.

145
00:06:31,685 --> 00:06:34,830
So, if your friends were to get
their memories back,

146
00:06:35,325 --> 00:06:36,807
the Library would know.

147
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:38,557
They'd try to find them

148
00:06:38,678 --> 00:06:40,557
to keep them safe

149
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,588
from the monster
that you warned us about.

150
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,033
You're telling me they have
books that describe

151
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:51,934
every damn thing everyone does
or ever will do,

152
00:06:52,064 --> 00:06:53,979
when you're sleeping,
when you're awake,

153
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,165
naughty or nice?

154
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,518
You know how much time
that would have saved me?

155
00:06:57,604 --> 00:06:59,665
Can we please not
with the Santa stuff right now?

156
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:02,164
Well, could you please not
with the angsty, nerdy stuff?

157
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,401
Huh?
No, 'cause that's who you are,

158
00:07:04,487 --> 00:07:05,877
and I don't judge you for it.

159
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,620
Dean Fogg was trying
to give me a message.

160
00:07:07,705 --> 00:07:10,710
Look, if we escape,
they'll just read our books,

161
00:07:10,796 --> 00:07:12,581
find out where we are,
and come after us.

162
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:14,416
So we just take the books
with us,

163
00:07:14,578 --> 00:07:16,583
or, uh... or destroy 'em.

164
00:07:17,035 --> 00:07:19,765
But first we have
to actually escape.

165
00:07:21,272 --> 00:07:23,337
I can get us
to the fireplace.

166
00:07:24,451 --> 00:07:25,838
Just be ready.

167
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,322
All I'm offering
is a location.

168
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:30,666
The rest is on you.

169
00:07:30,752 --> 00:07:32,906
Knowing where Bacchus is

170
00:07:32,992 --> 00:07:34,643
doesn't help me
if he runs away,

171
00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:36,794
which he'll do
the second I show up.

172
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:38,643
You see my problem,

173
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,868
and how maybe it is just
easier to kill you all.

174
00:07:49,021 --> 00:07:50,961
Do you know what this is?

175
00:07:59,866 --> 00:08:01,322
Where did you get that?

176
00:08:01,537 --> 00:08:03,033
I didn't,

177
00:08:03,523 --> 00:08:06,049
but I know that enough of it
will mess up a God long enough

178
00:08:06,135 --> 00:08:07,947
for you to do
whatever you need to do.

179
00:08:08,033 --> 00:08:09,861
Excuse me, Margo?

180
00:08:10,051 --> 00:08:11,322
Quick talk?

181
00:08:15,971 --> 00:08:19,165
Could you stop volunteering?

182
00:08:19,486 --> 00:08:21,135
I know Bacchus.
He's a friend.

183
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,541
Great.

184
00:08:23,172 --> 00:08:24,854
Then you'll poison him.

185
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,244
He'll never suspect a friend.

186
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,346
I could always kill you.

187
00:08:33,485 --> 00:08:34,705
Awesome.

188
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,338
Great choices.

189
00:08:36,615 --> 00:08:38,447
Well, let's get going, then.

190
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:40,781
Guys, in case it even
needs to be said,

191
00:08:40,867 --> 00:08:43,211
I know Marina.
She is not a helpful person.

192
00:08:43,297 --> 00:08:45,312
So just act accordingly.

193
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,805
Of course I'm getting paid.

194
00:08:51,991 --> 00:08:53,876
The McAllisters
have a bounty on your heads,

195
00:08:53,962 --> 00:08:54,964
dead or alive.

196
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,523
The real yous,

197
00:08:56,609 --> 00:08:58,154
not the witness-protection
identities.

198
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,969
So you can see how
it'd be profitable for me

199
00:09:00,055 --> 00:09:01,359
to get you back to normal.

200
00:09:01,445 --> 00:09:02,781
What are they offering?

201
00:09:04,225 --> 00:09:06,461
- Three Deweys.
- What the hell's a Dewey?

202
00:09:06,674 --> 00:09:07,969
As in Melvil Dewey,

203
00:09:08,085 --> 00:09:09,870
the most famous librarian
of all time.

204
00:09:09,956 --> 00:09:11,258
He has his own decimal system.

205
00:09:11,413 --> 00:09:14,031
Well, I think you're being
generous with the word "famous."

206
00:09:15,944 --> 00:09:18,719
Okay,
so in the new world order,

207
00:09:18,805 --> 00:09:20,414
there's just enough
magic in the air

208
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,875
to keep the boring masses
fat and happy,

209
00:09:22,994 --> 00:09:24,556
but you got an itch
to do something bigger,

210
00:09:24,641 --> 00:09:27,133
you have to file a request
with the Library.

211
00:09:27,303 --> 00:09:29,321
They decide if you're
trustworthy, and they give you

212
00:09:29,406 --> 00:09:31,187
a cute little battery
in the shape of a coin.

213
00:09:31,281 --> 00:09:33,731
They put the faces of famous
librarians on there,

214
00:09:33,817 --> 00:09:35,949
but Dewey's the only one
people can remember.

215
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:39,960
Well, and Laura Bush,
but Bushes just never stuck.

216
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,481
All right, well,
we'll pay the bounty ourselves.

217
00:09:42,981 --> 00:09:44,426
How are you
gonna get Dewey's?

218
00:09:44,563 --> 00:09:45,743
I don't know.
We'll figure it out.

219
00:09:45,828 --> 00:09:47,191
We always...
Sometimes.

220
00:09:47,277 --> 00:09:50,137
Most of the time
we do.

221
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,125
Five Deweys
to make it worth the delay,

222
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:58,135
and know that I have trackers
on all of you,

223
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,691
so if you try to run,
it won't go your way.

224
00:10:06,781 --> 00:10:08,571
Don't drink all my beer.

225
00:10:16,887 --> 00:10:18,639
Seems like this is the place.

226
00:10:18,725 --> 00:10:19,725
It is.

227
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:22,731
Those are maenads,
Bacchus followers.

228
00:10:22,887 --> 00:10:24,208
Get to it, then.

229
00:10:25,629 --> 00:10:29,980
Oh, and if they have pizza,
bring me some.

230
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,653
We can still find a way out.

231
00:10:36,739 --> 00:10:38,004
We already did.
This is it.

232
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,098
We're doing it right now.

233
00:10:39,184 --> 00:10:40,880
You had a weapon that
could have stopped him,

234
00:10:40,965 --> 00:10:43,082
and instead of using it,
you gave it to him.

235
00:10:43,183 --> 00:10:44,248
We tried that already

236
00:10:44,334 --> 00:10:45,598
with Julia's
God-killing bullet.

237
00:10:45,684 --> 00:10:47,091
All it did was kill
the monster's host,

238
00:10:47,176 --> 00:10:48,488
which in this case is Eliot.

239
00:10:48,574 --> 00:10:51,329
Who, for all we know,
is dead.

240
00:10:54,307 --> 00:10:55,559
Or he's trapped in there,

241
00:10:55,645 --> 00:10:57,480
forced to watch everything
the monster does,

242
00:10:57,566 --> 00:11:00,106
just waiting for us
to find a way to help him.

243
00:11:02,088 --> 00:11:04,301
What are you gonna
slip the ambrosia into?

244
00:11:06,223 --> 00:11:09,664
I guess I'll make a Fillorian
version of his favorite drink.

245
00:11:09,824 --> 00:11:12,644
Margarita, but instead of
salt on the rim, it will be...

246
00:11:12,729 --> 00:11:14,363
God meth. Perfect.

247
00:11:14,449 --> 00:11:17,723
Now go poison his ass so we can
get out of this malarial swamp.

248
00:11:17,826 --> 00:11:19,059
You know what's incredible?

249
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:20,512
How you can be
such a good friend

250
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:23,535
and such a terrible friend
at the exact same time.

251
00:11:30,027 --> 00:11:31,512
There's not a lot

252
00:11:31,663 --> 00:11:34,277
that I can relate to
in this world.

253
00:11:35,419 --> 00:11:37,629
People here are...

254
00:11:38,245 --> 00:11:41,879
well, people,
generally,

255
00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:44,379
and me, not so much.

256
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,848
But I relate to you.

257
00:11:49,385 --> 00:11:51,210
I hate being alone.

258
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:54,660
I don't like being left
with my own thoughts,

259
00:11:54,746 --> 00:11:56,197
such as they are.

260
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,738
I need friends.

261
00:11:59,824 --> 00:12:01,059
One way of making friends

262
00:12:01,145 --> 00:12:02,918
is not murdering
everyone you meet.

263
00:12:03,004 --> 00:12:05,449
Yes, you get my dilemma,

264
00:12:05,535 --> 00:12:06,668
but you're like me.

265
00:12:06,754 --> 00:12:07,910
Josh said so.

266
00:12:07,996 --> 00:12:10,457
A bad friend and a good friend
at the same time.

267
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:11,653
How do you do it?

268
00:12:11,739 --> 00:12:13,539
I have no choice.

269
00:12:14,439 --> 00:12:18,379
You... were friends with Eliot.

270
00:12:18,965 --> 00:12:21,231
Very best friends.

271
00:12:21,564 --> 00:12:23,339
Now you can be friends with me.

272
00:12:23,628 --> 00:12:24,934
It'll be the same.

273
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,935
You can show me
how to be more like him.

274
00:12:27,254 --> 00:12:28,918
No.

275
00:12:29,466 --> 00:12:30,840
I love Eliot.

276
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:33,301
I would do anything for him,
even help you,

277
00:12:33,397 --> 00:12:35,472
but you and I,
we won't ever be friends...

278
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:39,329
Unless you let me talk to him.

279
00:12:39,554 --> 00:12:41,746
Prove he's still alive
in there.

280
00:12:41,956 --> 00:12:43,316
I can't do that.

281
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,527
But you could let him go.

282
00:12:45,981 --> 00:12:48,012
You could choose a new body.

283
00:12:48,863 --> 00:12:50,348
But I like this one.

284
00:12:51,785 --> 00:12:54,363
I like the way
people look at me,

285
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:57,066
and you and your friends

286
00:12:57,152 --> 00:13:00,316
care so deeply
about what happens to it.

287
00:13:00,457 --> 00:13:02,426
Why would I ever leave it?

288
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:11,879
Hi.

289
00:13:11,965 --> 00:13:13,418
I'm here to see Bacchus.

290
00:13:13,575 --> 00:13:16,168
Um, yeah... I don't know
what you're talking about.

291
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:18,012
Um, it's... it's Ember, s...

292
00:13:18,098 --> 00:13:20,663
"Bacchanal" is the word
you're looking for.

293
00:13:20,749 --> 00:13:21,918
Cut the crap, Shoshana.

294
00:13:22,004 --> 00:13:23,453
It's me, Josh,
from the Bedsty party.

295
00:13:23,539 --> 00:13:24,863
- Come on.
- Oh, I-

296
00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:26,229
I didn't think
you'd remember me.

297
00:13:27,074 --> 00:13:28,523
Well, it's actually... you know,

298
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:29,825
it's really good
that you're here, 'cause

299
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,452
he's been darker
the last few weeks.

300
00:13:32,693 --> 00:13:34,934
I think a friendly face
could really help.

301
00:13:35,035 --> 00:13:36,569
Great.

302
00:13:39,203 --> 00:13:40,398
Hey, Q?

303
00:13:40,492 --> 00:13:42,266
- Oh, my...
- Oh, my God.

304
00:13:42,352 --> 00:13:43,789
Hey.

305
00:13:43,979 --> 00:13:45,571
Where have you been?
We couldn't find you.

306
00:13:45,656 --> 00:13:47,078
"Enrolled at Brakebills,"
she said,

307
00:13:47,164 --> 00:13:48,617
fully aware of the irony.

308
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,930
I just, um...

309
00:13:52,422 --> 00:13:54,125
I don't know where to start.
Uh...

310
00:13:55,178 --> 00:13:56,850
Have you heard
anything about Alice?

311
00:13:56,957 --> 00:13:58,068
No.

312
00:13:58,252 --> 00:13:59,818
No, I mean, not since
she completely

313
00:13:59,904 --> 00:14:01,673
screwed us over
at Blackspire, why?

314
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:03,499
Where is everyone else?

315
00:14:04,453 --> 00:14:07,076
If the Library's
going to arrest us on sight,

316
00:14:07,162 --> 00:14:10,240
how do we get one of these
coins, much less five?

317
00:14:10,381 --> 00:14:13,336
I asked around,
so there might be another way.

318
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:17,523
The Library's official story
is that the McAllister family

319
00:14:17,609 --> 00:14:19,524
heroically turned magic
back on.

320
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:23,162
So they gave them a free pass
to as many coins as they want.

321
00:14:23,248 --> 00:14:25,143
They give them
these special cards

322
00:14:25,229 --> 00:14:27,064
with no limits,
no questions asked.

323
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,137
Only a few of them exist, and
Hedges are calling them Black Cards.

324
00:14:29,222 --> 00:14:30,350
We could steal one.

325
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:31,444
If you steal a credit card,

326
00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:33,454
it only works until
it's reported stolen.

327
00:14:34,011 --> 00:14:35,171
With something this valuable,

328
00:14:35,336 --> 00:14:36,662
it's gonna happen
pretty damn quick.

329
00:14:36,747 --> 00:14:37,818
Forgery, maybe?

330
00:14:37,904 --> 00:14:39,507
Good enough to fool
the Library?

331
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:41,998
I used to know a guy,
a master counterfeiter.

332
00:14:42,084 --> 00:14:43,202
The Beast killed him, but...

333
00:14:43,287 --> 00:14:44,928
But that
was in your timeline.

334
00:14:45,104 --> 00:14:47,272
I did know Franky
since before Brakebills,

335
00:14:47,358 --> 00:14:49,343
so hopefully
your Penny did too.

336
00:14:49,601 --> 00:14:53,342
And hopefully
he has the same number.

337
00:14:54,696 --> 00:14:56,670
Damn it.

338
00:14:56,756 --> 00:14:58,717
I still have the DJ's phone.

339
00:15:01,304 --> 00:15:02,507
Well, the good news
is your Penny

340
00:15:02,592 --> 00:15:03,684
has the same password as me,

341
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:06,193
so I'm downloading
his contacts right now.

342
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:08,857
Ugh.
So many Insta notifications.

343
00:15:08,943 --> 00:15:10,561
Okay, I got his number.
I'll try him.

344
00:15:10,647 --> 00:15:11,615
I can't log in.

345
00:15:11,701 --> 00:15:13,381
It wants to send a text message

346
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:15,404
to my old phone to confirm,

347
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,454
but if I had my old phone,

348
00:15:16,539 --> 00:15:18,559
why the hell
would I be doing this?

349
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,646
Have you talked
to your dad lately?

350
00:15:20,818 --> 00:15:23,045
I called him
from Brian's phone,

351
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:24,246
but nobody picked up.

352
00:15:24,896 --> 00:15:26,354
Nobody answers their phone

353
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,745
when they don't recognize
the number, right?

354
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,554
You're probably right.

355
00:15:29,732 --> 00:15:31,674
Guys, he picked up.

356
00:15:34,543 --> 00:15:36,348
Oh, I don't think
you can park there.

357
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:38,534
Yeah, I don't think he cares.

358
00:15:38,619 --> 00:15:41,057
Shit just always seems
to work out for Franky.

359
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:42,549
Another timeline?

360
00:15:42,635 --> 00:15:44,002
That's wild.

361
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,893
I thought you were dead.
Likewise.

362
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:47,807
So the Franky I knew
was a counterfeiter.

363
00:15:47,893 --> 00:15:49,885
So am I, but for most jobs,

364
00:15:49,971 --> 00:15:51,112
my skills are overkill.

365
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:54,053
Duping objects to fool
regular dopes is simple.

366
00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:56,338
99% of the art you see
in museums is fake,

367
00:15:56,424 --> 00:15:57,877
because why waste
the real thing

368
00:15:57,963 --> 00:15:59,684
on people who can't tell
the difference anyway?

369
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:01,284
Fooling Magicians, though,

370
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,305
that's where the special sauce
comes in.

371
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:04,729
So what's the MacGuffin?

372
00:16:04,815 --> 00:16:06,455
A Library Black Card.

373
00:16:07,754 --> 00:16:09,643
That's gonna take
a lot of sauce.

374
00:16:11,135 --> 00:16:12,440
You know what?
Let me get that.

375
00:16:12,526 --> 00:16:14,049
That's probably for me.

376
00:16:18,364 --> 00:16:20,294
- Congratulations...
- Not now, guys.

377
00:16:23,151 --> 00:16:24,086
You know what?

378
00:16:24,172 --> 00:16:25,087
Actually, I'm gonna grab...

379
00:16:25,195 --> 00:16:26,687
Thank you. Thanks.

380
00:16:26,773 --> 00:16:27,901
Have a good one.

381
00:16:33,122 --> 00:16:34,784
Are you gonna explain that,
or...

382
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,910
- Are they even your size?
- They're always my size.

383
00:16:37,143 --> 00:16:39,653
Anyway, uh, Library Black Card.

384
00:16:39,882 --> 00:16:41,119
That's tricky,
but I can do it.

385
00:16:41,205 --> 00:16:43,006
Yeah, what'll it cost us?

386
00:16:43,176 --> 00:16:45,151
Whatever you're withdrawing
from the Library,

387
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,752
double it.

388
00:16:47,098 --> 00:16:48,854
Ten Dewey coins?

389
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:50,990
That's like "raise an army
of the dead" level magic.

390
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,260
- That is a big ask.
- Yeah.

391
00:16:52,354 --> 00:16:55,106
If my forgery works,
it won't matter.

392
00:16:55,316 --> 00:16:57,251
Now, I'm gonna need some stuff.

393
00:16:57,492 --> 00:16:59,807
I'm gonna need at least two
minutes with a real Black Card

394
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,994
to use as a mold,
two Philly cheesesteaks,

395
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:05,229
four liters of cherry soda,
not store brand...

396
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:07,432
That's a deal breaker.
I know. I know.

397
00:17:07,518 --> 00:17:08,813
And at least a third
of a Dewey coin

398
00:17:08,898 --> 00:17:10,086
to get us started.

399
00:17:10,187 --> 00:17:11,945
You need a battery
to get more batteries?

400
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,461
Yeah.
Call it, uh, seed magic.

401
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,266
Oh, uh...
we can't exactly

402
00:17:16,352 --> 00:17:18,307
walk into the Library
and just ask for one.

403
00:17:18,528 --> 00:17:20,628
Well, there's a game of Push
happening tonight.

404
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:22,141
What's Push?

405
00:17:22,235 --> 00:17:23,531
It's a card game.

406
00:17:23,781 --> 00:17:25,414
High rollers play for Deweys,

407
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,211
but you can buy in for less.

408
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:29,339
Any of you good at cards?

409
00:17:34,337 --> 00:17:35,935
A Magic card game is hard

410
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:37,101
under normal circumstances,

411
00:17:37,187 --> 00:17:39,025
but right now the Library's
only putting out enough magic

412
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,149
for... small-scale spells.

413
00:17:41,235 --> 00:17:43,867
I mean, one big transformation,

414
00:17:43,953 --> 00:17:45,742
and I'm gonna black out
the entire room.

415
00:17:45,828 --> 00:17:47,279
Yeah, it's about efficiency.

416
00:17:47,365 --> 00:17:48,938
Some Magicians are semi trucks,

417
00:17:49,024 --> 00:17:50,859
guzzling magic
to do a simple spell.

418
00:17:51,035 --> 00:17:52,539
Some of us are Priuses.

419
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:53,899
What are you?

420
00:17:54,232 --> 00:17:56,077
A sensible, mid-sized...

421
00:17:56,163 --> 00:17:57,673
What was the one that would
always explode?

422
00:17:57,758 --> 00:17:58,758
Yeah, that.

423
00:17:58,872 --> 00:18:01,102
Hey, can we back him up?

424
00:18:02,758 --> 00:18:04,781
No, no, not...
Not me.

425
00:18:05,048 --> 00:18:06,309
I can't even make a spark.

426
00:18:06,395 --> 00:18:08,969
I'm... well, I'm...
kind of persona non grata

427
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:10,777
at Push games
in this city, so...

428
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,336
I just don't want to.

429
00:18:12,422 --> 00:18:13,734
It's a one-on-one game,
anyway,

430
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,961
so no backup.

431
00:18:15,047 --> 00:18:17,352
But, uh, good luck.

432
00:18:18,753 --> 00:18:20,211
What do you have to wager?

433
00:18:20,355 --> 00:18:22,281
It's a protection amulet.

434
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:23,422
It's sort of all-purpose.

435
00:18:27,947 --> 00:18:29,469
It's not good enough.

436
00:18:29,605 --> 00:18:32,328
If you can't buy in,
make room for somebody who can.

437
00:18:33,135 --> 00:18:35,711
Uh, wait.
Um, he's a Traveler.

438
00:18:36,676 --> 00:18:39,984
I'll wager his exclusive
services for 48 hours.

439
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:41,156
- A year.
- A month.

440
00:18:41,242 --> 00:18:42,799
- Whoa, hold on.
- I won't lose.

441
00:18:42,885 --> 00:18:44,109
But you're a loser.

442
00:18:44,816 --> 00:18:47,555
A month.
No questions asked.

443
00:18:48,325 --> 00:18:50,016
Welcome to the game.

444
00:18:59,868 --> 00:19:01,227
Kay, the rules of Push
are simple.

445
00:19:01,342 --> 00:19:02,555
It's like the game War.

446
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,445
Two players.
Each draws a card.

447
00:19:04,765 --> 00:19:06,305
High card wins the hand.

448
00:19:06,781 --> 00:19:08,445
When the deck is gone,
the game's over.

449
00:19:08,531 --> 00:19:11,258
But the real art of the game
is knowing how to cheat.

450
00:19:16,508 --> 00:19:18,300
See, a... a shuffled
deck of cards

451
00:19:18,385 --> 00:19:19,852
is not a fixed thing.

452
00:19:19,938 --> 00:19:21,875
It's a cloud
of possibilities...

453
00:19:25,867 --> 00:19:28,266
And you can change the odds
if you know how.

454
00:19:39,425 --> 00:19:41,828
Put the right card
into your hand,

455
00:19:41,914 --> 00:19:43,929
or the wrong card
into your opponents.

456
00:19:58,755 --> 00:20:00,211
Wait, what is that?

457
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:04,297
Rules of Poker.

458
00:20:08,365 --> 00:20:09,969
You'll have to beat
three opponents

459
00:20:10,055 --> 00:20:11,080
to win the whole thing.

460
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,711
Shall we?

461
00:20:21,695 --> 00:20:24,203
The more probability spells
that you throw around,

462
00:20:24,365 --> 00:20:27,750
the more improbable
things can get.

463
00:20:31,527 --> 00:20:33,094
Be careful of those.

464
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,039
They killed Bobby Darin.

465
00:20:38,415 --> 00:20:41,343
The final round is when
you play for the Dewey.

466
00:21:24,538 --> 00:21:26,433
Breaking a tie is complicated.

467
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:27,592
Get the hats.

468
00:21:27,678 --> 00:21:29,159
You throw cards into a hat,

469
00:21:29,245 --> 00:21:32,718
and whichever you sink,
you score like a poker hand.

470
00:21:46,496 --> 00:21:47,984
Straight flush.

471
00:21:52,618 --> 00:21:55,140
I'm just saying,
what if he loses?

472
00:21:55,226 --> 00:21:56,250
I'm a Traveler.

473
00:21:56,335 --> 00:21:57,788
I'll grab the coin
and blip away.

474
00:21:57,968 --> 00:22:00,140
Yeah, and then the people
you just robbed

475
00:22:00,226 --> 00:22:01,671
hunt you down and torture you.

476
00:22:01,757 --> 00:22:04,234
So why don't we save that
for plan B?

477
00:22:05,861 --> 00:22:08,134
Listen, if you lose
this last hand,

478
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,310
it's over.

479
00:22:09,395 --> 00:22:11,320
I think we need
to be ready for plan B.

480
00:22:29,883 --> 00:22:31,848
What is the point
of this display?

481
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:40,679
You've used up all
the ambient magic in the room.

482
00:22:47,345 --> 00:22:50,111
I guess we'll just
have to play an honest game.

483
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,478
Got it.
Perfect.

484
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:15,556
Now the easy part.

485
00:23:15,642 --> 00:23:17,705
Borrow a Black Card
to use as a template.

486
00:23:20,042 --> 00:23:22,455
- Anything?
- No.

487
00:23:24,343 --> 00:23:26,253
Why are we going along
with this?

488
00:23:28,165 --> 00:23:29,444
Marina killed my mother.

489
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:30,773
That was a different Marina.

490
00:23:30,859 --> 00:23:32,507
How different?

491
00:23:32,873 --> 00:23:35,093
Are we just gonna
hand her a nuclear bomb?

492
00:23:35,345 --> 00:23:36,637
What's the alternative?

493
00:23:36,723 --> 00:23:38,658
We use it against her.

494
00:23:38,744 --> 00:23:40,489
Where does that end?

495
00:23:41,036 --> 00:23:43,583
I'm... I came here to get away
from that kind of shit.

496
00:23:43,927 --> 00:23:45,882
You know,
I'm getting really sick

497
00:23:45,968 --> 00:23:47,733
of being the voice
in the back of the room

498
00:23:47,819 --> 00:23:49,884
that everyone ignores.

499
00:23:50,171 --> 00:23:52,136
The other me, Sam,

500
00:23:52,385 --> 00:23:54,071
did whatever
she thought was right,

501
00:23:54,157 --> 00:23:55,717
regardless of what
anybody else thought.

502
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,400
I get it...

503
00:23:58,425 --> 00:24:02,205
because where I came from,
everyone I cared about is dead.

504
00:24:02,445 --> 00:24:04,405
No other voice
to listen to but mine.

505
00:24:05,681 --> 00:24:08,595
But maybe Sam didn't care
what anyone else thought

506
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:10,195
because she was alone.

507
00:24:11,067 --> 00:24:12,337
You aren't.

508
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,204
Whoa.

509
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:20,861
I got something here.

510
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,044
There's huge energy
coming off her purse.

511
00:24:24,286 --> 00:24:26,151
It's gotta be the Black Card
in there.

512
00:24:26,321 --> 00:24:27,490
Showtime.

513
00:24:30,778 --> 00:24:32,818
Oh, excuse me, I'm...

514
00:24:33,326 --> 00:24:34,524
I'm... I'm sorry.

515
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:35,904
Do I know you from somewhere?

516
00:24:36,064 --> 00:24:38,514
I mean, I dabbled in acting.

517
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,655
What have I seen you in?

518
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:44,840
Let's just say some
provocative films of the 1970s.

519
00:24:44,971 --> 00:24:46,764
Interesting.

520
00:25:03,405 --> 00:25:04,646
All finished.

521
00:25:04,732 --> 00:25:06,154
Great.
Let's go.

522
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,969
Uh, there is one
little thing.

523
00:25:08,128 --> 00:25:10,438
That special sauce
I was talking about before.

524
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,349
Most forgers use
complicated illusion work.

525
00:25:13,435 --> 00:25:15,626
That's not quite my thing.

526
00:25:26,365 --> 00:25:28,649
Did a bird just bring you
a sandwich?

527
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:30,319
Yeah, I guess she did.

528
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:31,782
You want it?

529
00:25:31,924 --> 00:25:33,509
Well, I mean, yeah, but...

530
00:25:33,595 --> 00:25:35,704
- But...
- What the fuck, Franky?

531
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:36,836
This is what
I'm talking about.

532
00:25:36,921 --> 00:25:38,696
Luck is my discipline.

533
00:25:38,856 --> 00:25:40,611
The forgeries I make
give whoever's holding them

534
00:25:40,696 --> 00:25:41,907
insanely good luck.

535
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,337
So nobody even bothers to check

536
00:25:43,423 --> 00:25:44,516
if the thing is fake.

537
00:25:44,734 --> 00:25:46,539
I've done the spellwork
so many times,

538
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:49,039
I'm just sort of encrusted
with it.

539
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:51,260
Luck is zero-sum,
so all that bad luck

540
00:25:51,346 --> 00:25:53,206
has got to go somewhere.

541
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,172
It goes into a bear?

542
00:25:58,258 --> 00:26:01,211
Somebody, not me,
has to hold that

543
00:26:01,297 --> 00:26:03,453
while the others bring
the Black Card to the Library.

544
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:07,094
And whoever's holding it
is gonna have a bad day.

545
00:26:08,053 --> 00:26:09,445
- I'll do it.
- No, Jules.

546
00:26:09,531 --> 00:26:11,225
You don't have to. He...
It's-it's okay.

547
00:26:12,707 --> 00:26:16,622
It's hard to explain,
but I'm kind of bulletproof.

548
00:26:16,871 --> 00:26:18,746
If anybody should have
terrible luck,

549
00:26:18,832 --> 00:26:19,907
it should be me.

550
00:26:20,154 --> 00:26:21,154
Why are you bulletproof?

551
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:23,559
That's none of your business.

552
00:26:23,969 --> 00:26:25,159
Pick it up.

553
00:26:32,197 --> 00:26:34,684
No, no, no, no, no, no,
something's wrong.

554
00:26:35,071 --> 00:26:36,926
Uh, whatever
"none of my business" shit

555
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,146
is going on with you,
it's interfering

556
00:26:38,231 --> 00:26:40,301
with the fortune spell,
so set it down.

557
00:26:40,606 --> 00:26:42,551
- Set it down!
- All right.

558
00:26:42,637 --> 00:26:43,637
Dahh...

559
00:26:45,582 --> 00:26:47,668
Looks like
you just volunteered.

560
00:26:58,084 --> 00:26:59,256
You awake?

561
00:26:59,357 --> 00:27:00,389
Nope.

562
00:27:00,475 --> 00:27:01,857
It's time.

563
00:27:41,516 --> 00:27:44,124
Anti-magic paint
on a magic lock.

564
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:46,023
Wish I had thought of that
before those

565
00:27:46,109 --> 00:27:48,070
book-sniffing bastards
ruined Christmas.

566
00:27:48,156 --> 00:27:49,429
Shh.

567
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,500
Which way now?

568
00:27:55,586 --> 00:27:56,886
I don't know.
Something isn't right.

569
00:27:56,971 --> 00:27:58,734
This should continue straight.

570
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:01,484
Well, you made this map

571
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:03,202
by mind-controlling
a cockroach.

572
00:28:03,296 --> 00:28:04,456
Shouldn't we trust our eyes

573
00:28:04,542 --> 00:28:06,941
rather than some
shit-eating bug?

574
00:28:08,981 --> 00:28:10,999
No, I think it's an illusion.

575
00:28:11,085 --> 00:28:12,965
There's spellwork on this wall.

576
00:28:25,357 --> 00:28:26,779
Or it's a wall.

577
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:44,459
This is it.
The books of everyone.

578
00:28:44,545 --> 00:28:46,865
You look for yours, and I'll
go look for my friends'.

579
00:28:48,366 --> 00:28:51,241
I gotta tell you,
it is such a relief

580
00:28:51,327 --> 00:28:53,282
to take off that
Ember disguise.

581
00:28:53,368 --> 00:28:54,906
So what have I been missing
down on Earth?

582
00:28:54,991 --> 00:28:56,193
It must be bad.

583
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:58,451
Your chakras are all fucked up.

584
00:28:58,537 --> 00:29:00,045
Oh, yeah.

585
00:29:00,272 --> 00:29:02,818
Uh, we got magic
turned back on.

586
00:29:02,904 --> 00:29:03,998
- Hey.
- And, you know,

587
00:29:04,084 --> 00:29:07,303
one of our friends
just betrayed us...

588
00:29:08,006 --> 00:29:10,001
Which is crazy, right?

589
00:29:10,087 --> 00:29:13,303
Like, who would do that?

590
00:29:13,693 --> 00:29:14,738
- Yeah.
- I got mind wiped.

591
00:29:14,871 --> 00:29:15,786
Yeah, I was living

592
00:29:15,871 --> 00:29:19,379
as this other dude
named Isaac for months.

593
00:29:19,465 --> 00:29:21,883
Um... that is exactly

594
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:24,278
kind of close
to my situation.

595
00:29:24,725 --> 00:29:28,530
So I'm being hunted
by this douchebag monster,

596
00:29:28,616 --> 00:29:31,090
and, like, I need a place
to crash, right?

597
00:29:31,176 --> 00:29:32,340
That's when I remember

598
00:29:32,426 --> 00:29:34,606
that squirrely little
human friend of yours

599
00:29:34,697 --> 00:29:36,927
said that he killed Ember,

600
00:29:37,053 --> 00:29:39,504
and I'm like, "I could
take that guy's place."

601
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,725
Live to fuck another day,
you know?

602
00:29:41,811 --> 00:29:43,387
It's kind of nice, you know?

603
00:29:43,473 --> 00:29:47,606
Freeing to... to live as
someone else for a little bit.

604
00:29:47,692 --> 00:29:49,231
Yeah, I guess.

605
00:29:49,324 --> 00:29:52,851
You know,
a famous cocksman once told me,

606
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,235
"Once you've had quantity,

607
00:29:55,321 --> 00:29:57,363
the only thing left
is strange."

608
00:29:58,745 --> 00:30:01,504
And, boy, is this place
full of strange.

609
00:30:02,113 --> 00:30:04,586
I mean,
Isaac's life was great.

610
00:30:04,672 --> 00:30:08,809
Lot of friends,
big, uh... family.

611
00:30:10,538 --> 00:30:13,053
But eventually, it...
It all ends,

612
00:30:13,139 --> 00:30:15,094
and your old life,

613
00:30:15,223 --> 00:30:17,348
your old problems,

614
00:30:18,132 --> 00:30:19,280
they catch up to you.

615
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,178
Or your problems
never find you

616
00:30:21,272 --> 00:30:22,577
and the party goes on forever.

617
00:30:22,666 --> 00:30:25,835
Oh, look at that, I'm dry.

618
00:30:25,981 --> 00:30:29,100
Is that...
Did you make for me?

619
00:30:29,249 --> 00:30:31,085
- Yes.
- Josh special?

620
00:30:31,171 --> 00:30:33,796
Uh, yes.
I... I made it for you.

621
00:30:33,881 --> 00:30:37,686
You and me, Joshy,
we're the same.

622
00:30:37,991 --> 00:30:40,194
We're born to be
the perfect hosts.

623
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:43,803
We want everyone around us
to have a good time.

624
00:30:43,889 --> 00:30:44,936
We make sure of it.

625
00:30:45,132 --> 00:30:47,163
Nobody does the same for us.

626
00:30:47,249 --> 00:30:48,311
Mm-mm.

627
00:30:48,438 --> 00:30:50,960
This is to Josh,
not to Isaac.

628
00:30:51,248 --> 00:30:52,788
This is to the real you.

629
00:30:57,835 --> 00:30:59,264
I'm sorry.

630
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:02,014
I... I pee-peed in it,

631
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,257
and you don't...
You don't drink that.

632
00:31:04,343 --> 00:31:06,022
So...

633
00:31:07,754 --> 00:31:11,053
This the dumbest plan.

634
00:31:11,174 --> 00:31:13,303
Franky says the disguises
won't matter.

635
00:31:13,507 --> 00:31:16,171
If the Black Card works,
nobody will question them.

636
00:31:16,669 --> 00:31:18,296
I feel like an idiot.

637
00:31:18,382 --> 00:31:19,905
Excuse me, sir.

638
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:22,077
You have a fresh look.

639
00:31:22,358 --> 00:31:23,725
Have you considered modeling?

640
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:29,194
Kay, it's just soup.

641
00:31:30,642 --> 00:31:32,607
Can't choke.
It's not scalding.

642
00:31:32,693 --> 00:31:34,132
It's totally safe.

643
00:31:37,743 --> 00:31:40,648
Oh, look at that line.
This is gonna take forever.

644
00:31:40,772 --> 00:31:42,233
I've been thinking,
while we're here,

645
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:43,975
we should get a bit extra.

646
00:31:44,272 --> 00:31:47,616
Five for Marina,
five for Franky, ten for us.

647
00:31:47,702 --> 00:31:50,557
We'd have to be insanely
lucky to get that much.

648
00:31:50,771 --> 00:31:54,311
The more luck we get,
the more bad luck Quentin gets.

649
00:31:54,466 --> 00:31:55,921
When this is over,
the McAllisters

650
00:31:56,011 --> 00:31:57,906
will still be after us.

651
00:31:58,296 --> 00:32:02,499
We'll need to do
some major cloaking spell.

652
00:32:02,651 --> 00:32:04,038
It could kill him.

653
00:32:04,124 --> 00:32:06,115
Hey!
There's a truck outside

654
00:32:06,201 --> 00:32:07,905
giving out
free ice cream!

655
00:32:09,901 --> 00:32:12,882
I mean,
two extra coins can't hurt.

656
00:32:15,453 --> 00:32:17,156
It's... it's all good.
Soup spills all the time.

657
00:32:17,241 --> 00:32:19,156
Thanks.

658
00:32:19,821 --> 00:32:21,218
Damn it.

659
00:32:21,304 --> 00:32:24,219
How the hell do you get
a paper cut from a paper towel?

660
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,565
- Welcome.
- Hi.

661
00:32:27,014 --> 00:32:29,968
So how can I help you today?

662
00:32:30,356 --> 00:32:33,257
We need twelve contained
current coins.

663
00:32:36,851 --> 00:32:38,468
- Here.
- No, God.

664
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:39,733
Keep it away.

665
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,741
Everything looks in order.

666
00:32:44,827 --> 00:32:47,241
Just need to check
one little thing.

667
00:32:55,401 --> 00:32:56,688
Shoot.

668
00:33:00,821 --> 00:33:02,367
Did you hear something?

669
00:33:03,961 --> 00:33:06,227
Where did it come from?

670
00:33:06,313 --> 00:33:08,635
Out of the... toilet.

671
00:33:08,721 --> 00:33:10,883
All right, then,
I'll send this requisition

672
00:33:10,969 --> 00:33:13,086
to the home office,
and they'll return your coins.

673
00:33:21,053 --> 00:33:23,500
I thought you said
your phone wasn't working.

674
00:33:30,711 --> 00:33:32,676
It's a voicemail
from my mom.

675
00:33:32,773 --> 00:33:34,227
Do you think...

676
00:33:34,313 --> 00:33:35,571
Q.

677
00:33:35,771 --> 00:33:37,157
It's got to be about my dad.

678
00:33:37,243 --> 00:33:38,828
- I'm not gonna...
- No, Q, the bear.

679
00:33:42,126 --> 00:33:44,672
Okay.

680
00:33:48,771 --> 00:33:50,219
Oh.

681
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:52,458
Your request
has been flagged

682
00:33:52,544 --> 00:33:54,063
for follow-up
with a supervisor.

683
00:33:54,149 --> 00:33:55,352
Wait here, please.

684
00:34:00,721 --> 00:34:02,219
A requisition
follow-up for you.

685
00:34:02,305 --> 00:34:04,300
Christ, can it wait?

686
00:34:04,701 --> 00:34:05,867
Fine.

687
00:34:20,013 --> 00:34:22,049
Sorry, I can't see for shit.

688
00:34:26,156 --> 00:34:27,722
This bloody thing's
making me crazy.

689
00:34:27,808 --> 00:34:28,995
- Do you mind?
- No.

690
00:34:29,081 --> 00:34:30,551
Do... do your thing.

691
00:34:32,379 --> 00:34:33,410
What do I do?

692
00:34:33,496 --> 00:34:35,691
Just, please,
don't listen to it

693
00:34:35,777 --> 00:34:37,535
until we hear back
from Penny and Katie.

694
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:40,379
Oh, shit!

695
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:43,746
Oh, Jesus Christ,
now I've got it in backwards.

696
00:34:43,878 --> 00:34:44,983
Oh!

697
00:34:47,258 --> 00:34:48,733
About those coins.

698
00:34:48,819 --> 00:34:51,037
Listen, the truth is,

699
00:34:51,192 --> 00:34:52,639
the red tape, the paperwork,

700
00:34:52,725 --> 00:34:54,837
it's, in my mind,
all just a wank.

701
00:34:55,071 --> 00:34:56,585
You guys gonna
blow yourselves up?

702
00:34:56,671 --> 00:34:58,139
- No.
- No?

703
00:34:58,225 --> 00:34:59,280
Great.

704
00:34:59,589 --> 00:35:03,429
Requested... approved.

705
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,055
Sorry about
the inconvenience.

706
00:35:10,342 --> 00:35:12,569
Thank you very much.
You have a good day.

707
00:35:15,592 --> 00:35:17,532
Jesus, shit.

708
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:19,699
Okay, they did it.
Drop the bear!

709
00:35:22,534 --> 00:35:24,686
It really came out of the...

710
00:35:24,796 --> 00:35:26,655
I don't want
to talk about it.

711
00:35:29,842 --> 00:35:31,382
Thank you, brother.

712
00:35:31,468 --> 00:35:33,054
I had a feeling
things would work out,

713
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,115
because they always do.

714
00:35:35,283 --> 00:35:37,158
By the way,
I'd destroy those ASAP.

715
00:35:37,244 --> 00:35:38,239
They'll be out of juice soon,

716
00:35:38,325 --> 00:35:40,310
but you don't want
to take any chances.

717
00:35:40,478 --> 00:35:42,308
I'm on it.

718
00:35:55,448 --> 00:35:58,194
You nutsacked out,
didn't you?

719
00:35:59,416 --> 00:36:02,436
Oh, well, "pussied out"
makes perfect sense here?

720
00:36:02,742 --> 00:36:05,249
Well, if you mean that
I couldn't go through with it,

721
00:36:05,335 --> 00:36:06,975
then, yes, you're right.

722
00:36:07,061 --> 00:36:10,710
Josh, we don't
have a choice here.

723
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:13,819
Now, where is the rest
of the Ambrosia?

724
00:36:15,541 --> 00:36:17,498
Fine,
but just know that Bacchus

725
00:36:17,584 --> 00:36:18,898
will never drink
anything you give him.

726
00:36:18,983 --> 00:36:20,944
Oh, I'm not gonna
give it to Bacchus.

727
00:36:21,172 --> 00:36:22,686
Yeah, I'm gonna
dump it in there.

728
00:36:22,944 --> 00:36:24,257
Everyone'll drink it.

729
00:36:24,343 --> 00:36:26,318
Are you nuts?
There are over 100 people here.

730
00:36:26,825 --> 00:36:28,770
You have no idea
what that will do to them.

731
00:36:28,855 --> 00:36:31,098
Well, I'm pretty sure
it'll fucking kill them.

732
00:36:31,432 --> 00:36:34,098
And I'll do it,
unless you start acting

733
00:36:34,184 --> 00:36:36,106
like a real pussy

734
00:36:36,348 --> 00:36:39,508
and take one
for the fucking team.

735
00:36:41,128 --> 00:36:44,669
Hey, uh, I'm sorry about...

736
00:36:44,755 --> 00:36:48,106
We've all peed in things
we regret.

737
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:54,536
I know Gods are supposed
to be distant and unknowable,

738
00:36:54,622 --> 00:36:56,517
but you're a good guy.

739
00:36:59,397 --> 00:37:01,232
I want to tell you a secret.

740
00:37:06,031 --> 00:37:09,192
What did you put... in this?

741
00:37:12,876 --> 00:37:13,942
I found my book.

742
00:37:14,028 --> 00:37:15,278
Now let's get
the hell out of here.

743
00:37:15,363 --> 00:37:17,243
I can't find
my friends' books.

744
00:37:18,558 --> 00:37:20,544
"The following books have been
removed from circulation

745
00:37:20,629 --> 00:37:23,723
for revisions.
Q. Coldwater, A. Quinn."

746
00:37:23,947 --> 00:37:26,403
They're filling in
the endings of our books...

747
00:37:26,825 --> 00:37:27,911
the pages that were missing

748
00:37:27,997 --> 00:37:29,333
because of the Great
Blank Spot.

749
00:37:37,585 --> 00:37:38,770
Nick?

750
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:42,417
Hey, I'm sorry about
your friends' books,

751
00:37:42,503 --> 00:37:44,739
but this is our chance.

752
00:37:44,855 --> 00:37:47,278
- Come with me.
- I can't.

753
00:37:47,384 --> 00:37:49,176
I... I can't leave
without their books.

754
00:37:49,445 --> 00:37:50,899
Well, I want to do the...

755
00:37:50,985 --> 00:37:53,251
Look, just go, while
you still have the chance.

756
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:55,774
Okay, I-I can find
the Revision Room on my own.

757
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:59,048
For what it's worth,

758
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,415
you're still on my Nice List.

759
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,675
The fuck?

760
00:38:38,535 --> 00:38:39,902
Do you remember me?

761
00:38:41,604 --> 00:38:42,972
Because I don't.

762
00:38:44,237 --> 00:38:47,894
I don't remember my name
or where I came from.

763
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,214
But I remember you.

764
00:38:51,833 --> 00:38:55,566
You took something from me,
something important,

765
00:38:55,652 --> 00:38:59,311
and then you...
threw me in a cage,

766
00:38:59,397 --> 00:39:03,402
and I would like
for you to explain.

767
00:39:03,622 --> 00:39:06,089
You remember all that,

768
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:08,855
but you don't remember
what you are,

769
00:39:09,161 --> 00:39:10,745
what you did.

770
00:39:10,922 --> 00:39:13,339
The word "monster"
has been thrown around.

771
00:39:13,535 --> 00:39:14,808
That's right.

772
00:39:14,995 --> 00:39:17,855
We put you with
the rest of your kind.

773
00:39:18,419 --> 00:39:20,449
And I ate them.

774
00:39:20,535 --> 00:39:23,253
You're kind of making my case
for me here.

775
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:25,364
We have the same parents.

776
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:27,972
Why am I a monster
and you're a God?

777
00:39:28,058 --> 00:39:29,589
If you don't want
to be a monster,

778
00:39:29,795 --> 00:39:31,019
then let me go.

779
00:39:31,164 --> 00:39:32,949
Give me back
what you took from me,

780
00:39:33,035 --> 00:39:34,312
and maybe I will.

781
00:39:35,928 --> 00:39:38,281
I can't... ever.

782
00:39:38,857 --> 00:39:40,398
I'm sorry.

783
00:39:41,085 --> 00:39:42,910
It was a part of me,

784
00:39:43,222 --> 00:39:46,749
and now it's a part of you.

785
00:39:48,965 --> 00:39:53,163
Burning in your body.

786
00:39:53,256 --> 00:39:54,788
Wait. Wait.

787
00:39:54,941 --> 00:39:56,876
This world needs me.

788
00:39:57,038 --> 00:39:58,953
Its God is dead.

789
00:39:59,445 --> 00:40:00,765
You don't have to do this.

790
00:40:00,851 --> 00:40:03,327
There's others.
There's still time.

791
00:40:03,413 --> 00:40:05,038
We can figure something out.

792
00:40:05,129 --> 00:40:06,884
It doesn't have to be me.

793
00:40:07,063 --> 00:40:09,273
It doesn't have to...

794
00:40:29,064 --> 00:40:31,603
What the fuck did he
just rip out of him?

795
00:40:31,689 --> 00:40:33,603
Whatever it is,
to a fairy eye,

796
00:40:33,689 --> 00:40:36,506
it's like staring
straight at the sun.

797
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:41,213
They're real.

798
00:40:42,522 --> 00:40:44,392
Well, it's been a pleasure.

799
00:40:45,733 --> 00:40:47,330
The trackers on us?

800
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:49,345
Not actually a thing.

801
00:40:49,555 --> 00:40:52,017
You guys are too lawful good
to bitch out.

802
00:41:00,379 --> 00:41:02,369
- Marina.
- Hmm?

803
00:41:02,722 --> 00:41:04,637
I've been looking for you.

804
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,541
Excuse me, miss.

805
00:41:10,627 --> 00:41:12,041
These are free to a good home.

806
00:41:12,127 --> 00:41:13,252
Are you interested?

807
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,765
Hey, are you sure
Marina's apartment's

808
00:41:20,851 --> 00:41:22,606
the safest place
for us to meet?

809
00:41:22,692 --> 00:41:24,275
It's not Marina's.

810
00:41:25,101 --> 00:41:26,306
It's mine.

811
00:41:26,392 --> 00:41:27,525
What did you do?

812
00:41:27,621 --> 00:41:29,056
I handled the problem.

813
00:41:29,171 --> 00:41:31,775
Now, can we do this
cloaking spell

814
00:41:31,861 --> 00:41:33,939
before the McAllisters show up
and kill all of us?

815
00:41:38,055 --> 00:41:39,603
Hey.

816
00:41:39,814 --> 00:41:41,423
You haven't listened?

817
00:41:42,315 --> 00:41:44,166
You know,
your bad luck's gone.

818
00:41:45,089 --> 00:41:46,884
Safe as it'll ever be.

819
00:41:48,055 --> 00:41:51,564
But that's not
what's really stopping you.

820
00:41:52,268 --> 00:41:54,069
The other me...

821
00:41:54,736 --> 00:41:56,397
Brian,

822
00:41:56,952 --> 00:41:59,072
his dad died
when he was a kid.

823
00:42:00,203 --> 00:42:02,765
He was too little
to even understand.

824
00:42:03,332 --> 00:42:05,585
All of his problems
were like that.

825
00:42:05,874 --> 00:42:07,397
No sharp edges.

826
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:08,483
Yeah.

827
00:42:09,933 --> 00:42:11,452
Look at us.

828
00:42:12,297 --> 00:42:14,765
We paid a hell
of a fucking price.

829
00:42:16,649 --> 00:42:18,593
You gave up being a Goddess.

830
00:42:20,848 --> 00:42:22,828
I gave up my father.

831
00:42:28,137 --> 00:42:30,077
What did we get in return?

832
00:42:30,804 --> 00:42:31,929
Magic is back.

833
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:39,441
Mm-mm, not in the way
that we wanted.

834
00:42:41,952 --> 00:42:45,222
How are you not furious?

835
00:42:48,313 --> 00:42:53,581
Because, for almost everyone,
the world is a little brighter,

836
00:42:53,667 --> 00:42:56,323
even if they never know why.

837
00:42:57,014 --> 00:42:59,831
I hate the Library
for what they did,

838
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:04,050
but my part in it,
I knew what it cost.

839
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:08,550
And I'd do it again.

840
00:43:12,654 --> 00:43:14,386
But you wouldn't.

841
00:43:17,347 --> 00:43:19,462
Will you sit here
for a minute?

842
00:43:20,141 --> 00:43:21,836
Yeah.

843
00:43:24,548 --> 00:43:26,292
<i>Hi, Quentin.</i>

844
00:43:27,816 --> 00:43:30,423
<i>Sorry to leave a message
with bad news.</i>

845
00:43:31,659 --> 00:43:35,000
<i>I need to talk to you
about your father.</i>
