Do you know what this is?

182
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:02,173
Where did you get that?

183
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,751
I didn't,

184
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,129
but I know that enough of it
will mess up a god long enough

185
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,088
for you to do whatever
you need to do.

186
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,817
Excuse me, Margo?

187
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:12,322
Quick talk?

188
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:14,626
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

189
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:20,133
Could you stop volunteering?

190
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,235
I know Bacchus. He's a friend.

191
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:24,294
Great.

192
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:26,135
Then you'll poison him.

193
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:28,032
He'll never suspect a friend.

194
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:34,013
I could always kill you.

195
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,273
Awesome.

196
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,349
Great choices.

197
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,346
Well, let's get going, then.

198
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,878
Guys, in case it
even needs to be said,

199
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:42,979
I know Marina.

200
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:44,319
She is not a helpful person.

201
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:45,950
So, just act accordingly.

202
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:50,825
(SIGHS)

203
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,260
Of course I'm getting paid.

204
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,977
The McAllistairs have
a bounty on your heads,

205
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,128
dead or alive.

206
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,636
The real yous,

207
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,229
not the witness-protection
identities.

208
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:01,069
So, you can see how
it'd be profitable for me

209
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:02,302
to get you back to normal.

210
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,375
What are they offering?

211
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:07,447
Three Deweys. What
the hell's a Dewey?

212
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:08,977
As in Melvil Dewey,

213
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,847
the most famous
librarian of all time.

214
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,117
He has his own decimal system.

215
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:14,619
Well, I think you're being
generous with the word "famous."

216
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:19,319
Okay, so in the New World Order,

217
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,451
there is just enough
magic in the air

218
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:23,690
to keep the boring
masses fat and happy,

219
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,823
but you got an itch to
do something bigger,

220
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,232
you have to file a
request with the Library.

221
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,441
They decide if you're
trustworthy, and they give you

222
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,263
a cute little battery
in the shape of a coin.

223
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:34,705
They put the faces of
famous librarians on there,

224
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,534
but Dewey's the only
one people can remember.

225
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,703
Well, and Laura Bush,
but Bushes just never stuck.

226
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:43,328
All right, well, we'll pay
the bounty ourselves.

227
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:45,278
How are you gonna get Deweys?

228
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:46,862
I don't know.
We'll figure it out.

229
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,377
We always... Sometimes.

230
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:50,617
Most of the time, we do.

231
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,022
Five Deweys to make
it worth the delay,

232
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,275
and know that I have
trackers on all of you,

233
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:02,428

it won't go your way.

Don't drink all my beer.

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,044
Seems like this is the place.

It is. (SIGHS)

Those are Maenads,

239
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:26,685
Get to it, then.

240
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:31,995
Oh, and if they have
pizza, bring me some.

We can still find a way out.

00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:41,935
We already did. This is
it. We're doing it right now.

244
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,486
You have a weapon that
could have stopped him,

245
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,445
and instead of using
it, you gave it to him.

246
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:48,038
We tried that already with
Julia's god-killing bullet.

247
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,592
All it did was kill
The Monster's host,

248
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:50,845
which in this case is Eliot.

249
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:53,519
Who, for all we know, is dead.

(SCOFFS)

00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:57,987
Or he's trapped in there,

00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,802
forced to watch everything
The Monster does,

00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,352
just waiting for us to
find a way to help him.

What are you gonna
slip the ambrosia into?

255
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:12,269
I guess I'll make a Fillorian
version of his favorite drink,

256
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,967
margarita, but instead of
salt on the rim, it will be...

00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,242
Now go poison his ass so we
can get out of this malarial swamp.

You know what's incredible?

260
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:22,880
How you can be
such a good friend

261
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:25,145
and such a terrible friend
at the exact same time.

to in this world.

and me, not so much.

267

But I relate to you.

00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:57,274
I don't like being left
with my own thoughts,

270

such as they are.

00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:02,019
I need friends.

272
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:03,521
One way of making friends

273
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,354
is not murdering
everyone you meet.

274
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:07,690
Yes, you get my dilemma,

275
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,092
but you're like me.

276
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:10,255
Josh said so.

277
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,890
A bad friend and a good
friend at the same time.

How do you do it?
I have no choice.

279
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:20,267
You were friends with Eliot.

280
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,407
Very best friends.

281
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,544
Now you can be friends with me.

282
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:27,475
It'll be the same.

283
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:29,209

how to be more like him.

00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,441
No.

00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,250
I love Eliot.

286
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,722
I would do anything
for him, even help you,

287
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,723
but you and I, we
won't ever be friends.

288
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,126
Unless you let me talk to him.

289

Prove he's still alive in there.

290
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,828
I can't do that.

291
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,795
But you could let him go.

292
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:50,332
You could choose a new body.

what happens to it.

Well, it's actually, you know...

It's really good
that you're here,

where to start. Uh...

No, I mean, not

going to arrest us on sight,

how do we get one of

I asked around, so there
might be another way.

330
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:20,088
The Library's official story
is that the McAllistair family

331
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,650
heroically turned magic back on.

332
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:25,665
So, they gave them a free pass
to as many coins as they want.

333
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,633
They give them
these special cards

334
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,328
with no limits, no
questions asked.

335
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:30,936
Only a few of them
exist, and hedges

336
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,047
are calling them Black Cards.

337
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,095
We could steal one.

338
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:34,216
If you steal a credit card,

339
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,300
it only works until
it's reported stolen.

Good enough to fool the Library?

a master counterfeiter.

The Beast killed him, but...

But that was in your timeline.

I did know Frankie
since before Brakebills,

348
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,824
so hopefully your
Penny did, too.

349
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,894
And hopefully he
has the same number.

00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,162
Damn it. (CHUCKLES)

00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:00,793

364
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:26,925

was a counterfeiter.

00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,341
So am I, but for most jobs,

377
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:53,647

That's tricky, but I can do it.

398

Yeah, what'll it cost us?

withdrawing from the Library,

it won't matter.

Now, I'm gonna need some stuff.

406
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,318
I'm gonna need at least two
minutes with a real Black Card

00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:38,200
I'm sorry.

535
00:24:38,277 --> 00:24:39,506
Do I know you from somewhere?

536
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:42,213
I mean, I dabbled in acting.

537
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:44,574
What have I seen you in?

538
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,849
Let's just say some
provocative films of the 1970s.

540

00:25:08,374 --> 00:25:09,706
Great. Let's go.

542
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:11,604
Uh, there is one little thing.

543
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:14,005
That special sauce I
was talking about before.

544
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,210

complicated illusion work.

545
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:19,251
That's not quite my thing.

you a sandwich?

Yeah, I guess she did.

00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:37,634
Well, I mean, yeah, but...

00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,331
But what the fuck, Frankie?

553
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:40,682
This is what I'm talking about.

554
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,607
Luck is my discipline.

555
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:45,576
The forgeries I make give whoever's
holding them insanely good luck.

556
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:48,512
So, nobody even bothers
to check if the thing is fake.

557
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:52,517
I've done the spellwork so many
times, I'm just sort of encrusted with it.

558
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:56,316
Luck is zero-sum, so all that
bad luck has got to go somewhere.

559
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,792
It goes into a bear?

560

me, has to hold that

Black Card to the Library.

562
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:10,662
And whoever's holding it
is gonna have a bad day.

563
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:14,098
I'll do it. No, Jules.
You don't have to. He...

564
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:15,173
It's okay.

565
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:20,171

I'm kind of bulletproof.

terrible luck, it should be me.

567
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:24,749
Why are you bulletproof?

568
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,977
That's none of your business.

569
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:28,677

no, something's wrong.
