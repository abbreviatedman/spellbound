1
00:00:07,384 --> 00:00:09,430
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:09,473 --> 00:00:10,561
Are you Santa Claus?

3
00:00:10,605 --> 00:00:12,128
Oh, I'm not... not that.

4
00:00:12,172 --> 00:00:13,260
Magic's gone.

5
00:00:13,303 --> 00:00:14,565
I'm not a magician,

6
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:16,176
but I could feel it
when it was gone,

7
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:18,091
and I knew it wasn't
a coincidence

8
00:00:18,134 --> 00:00:20,093
when I went into remission
a week later.

9
00:00:20,136 --> 00:00:21,529
What timeline are you from?

10
00:00:21,572 --> 00:00:22,965
The one where you
owe me child support.

11
00:00:23,009 --> 00:00:24,271
I'm kidding.

12
00:00:24,314 --> 00:00:25,750
Kay, then if you want me to help

13
00:00:25,794 --> 00:00:27,404
these students, can
you tell me who they are?

14
00:00:27,448 --> 00:00:29,580
Their lives were
in grave danger.

15
00:00:29,624 --> 00:00:31,278
I cast a spell that

16
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:33,280
erased their identities
and gave them new ones.

17
00:00:33,323 --> 00:00:34,716
I mean, isn't there anything
you can do?

18
00:00:34,759 --> 00:00:36,979
If I reveal that the spell
can be reversed,

19
00:00:37,023 --> 00:00:38,459
then someone would reverse
the spell.

20
00:00:44,552 --> 00:00:46,119
Bacchus,
what are you doing here?

21
00:00:46,162 --> 00:00:47,772
Why do you want everyone
thinking you're Ember?

22
00:00:47,816 --> 00:00:49,122
Thanks for popping in.

23
00:00:50,601 --> 00:00:51,646
Oh, my God.

24
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:53,256
Mis hermanos.

25
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:54,779
Where were you?
We... we looked everywhere...

26
00:00:54,823 --> 00:00:56,607
- Stay back.
- Why?

27
00:00:56,651 --> 00:00:58,566
Because I'm not here to play.

28
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,483
Marina.

29
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,703
Why do you look like
you're fleeing something?

30
00:01:05,747 --> 00:01:08,750
It's me, Margo,
previously known as Janet.

31
00:01:08,793 --> 00:01:11,013
Look, I'm gonna do you a solid.

32
00:01:11,057 --> 00:01:13,189
Don't go up there.
Why?

33
00:01:13,233 --> 00:01:15,539
Because there's an uninvited
guest in my apartment

34
00:01:15,583 --> 00:01:17,715
who's probably killing
your friends right about now.

35
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,240
Look, I don't know what he is,
and I'm assuming it's a "he"

36
00:01:20,283 --> 00:01:23,243
because this is some
toxically masculine behavior,

37
00:01:23,286 --> 00:01:26,376
but he walked through
every ward and shield I had,

38
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,074
set off every alarm.

39
00:01:28,117 --> 00:01:29,771
So instead of going inside,

40
00:01:29,814 --> 00:01:31,294
I'm gonna get
a breakfast burrito.

41
00:01:31,338 --> 00:01:32,339
You wanna join?

42
00:01:32,382 --> 00:01:34,036
We have to help them.

43
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,343
Oh, you're one of those.

44
00:01:36,386 --> 00:01:38,519
Fine, you wanna
stick your neck out?

45
00:01:38,562 --> 00:01:40,434
There's something inside
that can help you.

46
00:01:40,477 --> 00:01:42,088
Do tell.

47
00:01:44,307 --> 00:01:45,830
No traveling.

48
00:01:45,874 --> 00:01:47,354
Where to start?

49
00:01:47,397 --> 00:01:49,617
Order is important
with these things.

50
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,620
Who goes first?
Who goes last?

51
00:01:52,663 --> 00:01:54,796
Oh, you keep looking at him...

52
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,799
Because you don't
want him to die?

53
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,758
Which means
he has to go before you.

54
00:02:02,891 --> 00:02:05,676
You care about all of them.

55
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,721
So you're last.

56
00:02:11,421 --> 00:02:12,509
Thank Christ.

57
00:02:12,553 --> 00:02:13,771
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

58
00:02:13,815 --> 00:02:16,209
Not... Eliot.

59
00:02:16,252 --> 00:02:18,559
This thing has god-level power,

60
00:02:18,602 --> 00:02:21,214
and I have a bad history
with gods,

61
00:02:21,257 --> 00:02:23,346
since apparently one killed me.

62
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,739
No, it's fine.

63
00:02:24,782 --> 00:02:25,783
Different me, but I didn't want

64
00:02:25,827 --> 00:02:27,220
to get caught off guard again,

65
00:02:27,263 --> 00:02:29,744
so I called in every favor I had

66
00:02:29,787 --> 00:02:31,702
to build a defense system.

67
00:02:31,746 --> 00:02:34,444
All you have to do is get him
to sit in the gold chair.

68
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:35,576
Why the gold chair?

69
00:02:35,619 --> 00:02:37,230
Because it had to be something,

70
00:02:37,273 --> 00:02:38,883
and everybody wants to sit
in the gold chair.

71
00:02:38,927 --> 00:02:40,102
It's total power move.

72
00:02:41,843 --> 00:02:43,323
I'm so glad you came.

73
00:02:43,366 --> 00:02:45,760
Saves me
having to hunt you down.

74
00:02:45,803 --> 00:02:49,111
I've got so much of that
ahead of me already.

75
00:02:49,155 --> 00:02:50,721
What is he talking about?

76
00:02:50,765 --> 00:02:53,681
He's, uh, hunting gods.

77
00:02:53,724 --> 00:02:57,293
It's vengeance
for locking you in the castle.

78
00:02:57,337 --> 00:02:59,165
They did more than that,

79
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,428
and so did you.

80
00:03:01,471 --> 00:03:03,430
You tried to kill me.

81
00:03:07,825 --> 00:03:10,524
You were all part of it.

82
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:15,790
Then what?

83
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:17,531
There's a bell on the table.

84
00:03:17,574 --> 00:03:18,662
Ring it.

85
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:22,362
And he explodes?

86
00:03:22,405 --> 00:03:24,146
He gets a face full
of distilled ambrosia.

87
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,887
It's basically meth for gods.

88
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,758
Its gets them high, but an overdose

89
00:03:27,802 --> 00:03:28,933
will knock them on their asses.

90
00:03:31,936 --> 00:03:34,461
Tell me Eliot
is still in there somewhere.

91
00:03:34,504 --> 00:03:36,463
Not that I've seen.

92
00:03:36,506 --> 00:03:38,639
Your round, innocent face

93
00:03:38,682 --> 00:03:41,598
will make your death
particularly upsetting,

94
00:03:41,642 --> 00:03:43,296
so I've decided
to start with you.

95
00:03:46,603 --> 00:03:48,301
I can give you Bacchus.

96
00:03:51,434 --> 00:03:53,610
You're hunting gods,

97
00:03:53,654 --> 00:03:56,657
and I found him hiding
someplace far away.

98
00:03:57,701 --> 00:03:59,877
Hiding from you, right?

99
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,490
I can take you there...

100
00:04:03,533 --> 00:04:05,187
if you let them live.

101
00:04:06,797 --> 00:04:08,321
All of them.

102
00:04:13,543 --> 00:04:16,285
Perhaps we can be friends
after all.

103
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:33,476
So where is everyone else?

104
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,696
I don't know.

105
00:04:35,739 --> 00:04:37,698
They were supposed
to remain hidden.

106
00:04:39,874 --> 00:04:41,832
I meant to protect you.

107
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:46,620
Doesn't really seem
like I need protection.

108
00:04:46,663 --> 00:04:48,491
I mean, nothing
your spell threw at me

109
00:04:48,535 --> 00:04:49,927
even left a scratch.

110
00:04:49,971 --> 00:04:52,452
Reynard did say,
even without their powers,

111
00:04:52,495 --> 00:04:53,801
gods are hard to kill.

112
00:04:55,324 --> 00:04:59,459
I wouldn't underestimate
the will of Irene McAllister.

113
00:04:59,502 --> 00:05:01,722
Huh.

114
00:05:01,765 --> 00:05:03,767
Tell a few people
that you're leaving forever,

115
00:05:03,811 --> 00:05:07,293
and look what
the ungrateful bastards do.

116
00:05:07,336 --> 00:05:09,904
Nice.

117
00:05:09,947 --> 00:05:11,645
You know, if the deal is broken

118
00:05:11,688 --> 00:05:12,776
and the McAllisters are coming,

119
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,865
I'm gonna have to warn everyone.

120
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:18,782
Contacting your friends will
put a target on their backs.

121
00:05:18,826 --> 00:05:20,567
To be clear,

122
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,352
you put the target on our backs.

123
00:05:23,396 --> 00:05:25,441
You betrayed us.

124
00:05:25,485 --> 00:05:27,008
Hmm.

125
00:05:27,051 --> 00:05:30,011
I sacrificed everything
to bring back magic.

126
00:05:30,054 --> 00:05:32,927
You know what I sacrificed,

127
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,058
and look what you do with it.

128
00:05:35,538 --> 00:05:39,673
Yes, Ms. Wicker,

129
00:05:39,716 --> 00:05:44,634
I made a deal
with the goddamn Library,

130
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,985
and in doing so,
I saved your lives.

131
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:50,031
Yeah, well, you're pretty
fucking quick to compromise,

132
00:05:50,074 --> 00:05:51,424
you know that?

133
00:05:52,816 --> 00:05:55,950
Now, I need to find my friends,
but I can't do magic,

134
00:05:55,993 --> 00:05:58,822
so you're going to cast
the locator spell for me.

135
00:06:20,017 --> 00:06:21,845
Dean Fogg. Finally.

136
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:23,630
I only have a moment.

137
00:06:25,545 --> 00:06:26,894
You know how the Library

138
00:06:26,937 --> 00:06:30,463
contains the books of everyone
who ever lived?

139
00:06:30,506 --> 00:06:31,638
Yeah.

140
00:06:31,681 --> 00:06:34,554
The Great Blank Spot is over.

141
00:06:34,597 --> 00:06:36,817
The Library can update
their books again.

142
00:06:38,514 --> 00:06:42,344
So, if your friends were to get
their memories back,

143
00:06:42,388 --> 00:06:43,606
the Library would know.

144
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,652
They'd try to find them

145
00:06:45,695 --> 00:06:47,958
to keep them safe

146
00:06:48,002 --> 00:06:51,658
from the monster
that you warned us about.

147
00:06:52,702 --> 00:06:54,704
You're telling me they have
books that describe

148
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:58,404
every damn thing everyone does
or ever will do,

149
00:06:58,447 --> 00:07:00,406
when you're sleeping,
when you're awake,

150
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:01,972
naughty or nice?

151
00:07:02,016 --> 00:07:04,105
You know how much time
that would have saved me?

152
00:07:04,148 --> 00:07:06,499
Can we please not
with the Santa stuff right now?

153
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:08,979
Well, could you please not
with the angsty, nerdy stuff?

154
00:07:09,023 --> 00:07:11,068
Huh?
No, 'cause that's who you are,

155
00:07:11,112 --> 00:07:12,722
and I don't judge you for it.

156
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,681
Dean Fogg was trying
to give me a message.

157
00:07:14,724 --> 00:07:17,553
Look, if we escape,
they'll just read our books,

158
00:07:17,597 --> 00:07:19,163
find out where we are,
and come after us.

159
00:07:19,207 --> 00:07:21,557
So we just take the books
with us,

160
00:07:21,601 --> 00:07:23,907
or, uh... or destroy 'em.

161
00:07:23,951 --> 00:07:25,996
But first we have
to actually escape.

162
00:07:28,085 --> 00:07:29,739
I can get us to the fireplace.

163
00:07:31,437 --> 00:07:32,568
Just be ready.

164
00:07:33,917 --> 00:07:36,180
All I'm offering is a location.

165
00:07:36,224 --> 00:07:37,530
The rest is on you.

166
00:07:37,573 --> 00:07:39,706
Knowing where Bacchus is

167
00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:41,490
doesn't help me if he runs away,

168
00:07:41,534 --> 00:07:43,927
which he'll do
the second I show up.

169
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:45,581
You see my problem,

170
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:48,671
and how maybe it is just
easier to kill you all.

171
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,593
Do you know what this is?

172
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:07,995
Where did you get that?

173
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:10,432
I didn't,

174
00:08:10,476 --> 00:08:12,782
but I know that enough of it
will mess up a god long enough

175
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,784
for you to do
whatever you need to do.

176
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:15,959
Excuse me, Margo?

177
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,918
Quick talk?

178
00:08:22,749 --> 00:08:25,926
Could you stop volunteering?

179
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:27,971
I know Bacchus.
He's a friend.

180
00:08:28,015 --> 00:08:29,930
Great.

181
00:08:29,973 --> 00:08:31,932
Then you'll poison him.

182
00:08:31,975 --> 00:08:33,847
He'll never suspect a friend.

183
00:08:38,678 --> 00:08:40,462
I could always kill you.

184
00:08:40,506 --> 00:08:41,855
Awesome.

185
00:08:41,898 --> 00:08:43,117
Great choices.

186
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,119
Well, let's get going, then.

187
00:08:45,162 --> 00:08:47,513
Guys, in case it even
needs to be said,

188
00:08:47,556 --> 00:08:48,601
I know Marina.

189
00:08:48,644 --> 00:08:49,950
She is not a helpful person.

190
00:08:49,993 --> 00:08:51,908
So just act accordingly.

191
00:08:57,044 --> 00:08:58,828
Of course I'm getting paid.

192
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,700
The McAllisters
have a bounty on your heads,

193
00:09:00,743 --> 00:09:01,918
dead or alive.

194
00:09:01,962 --> 00:09:03,485
The real yous,

195
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:04,965
not the witness-protection
identities.

196
00:09:05,008 --> 00:09:06,662
So you can see how
it'd be profitable for me

197
00:09:06,706 --> 00:09:08,055
to get you back to normal.

198
00:09:08,098 --> 00:09:09,230
What are they offering?

199
00:09:11,101 --> 00:09:13,190
- Three Deweys.
- What the hell's a Dewey?

200
00:09:13,234 --> 00:09:14,801
As in Melvil Dewey,

201
00:09:14,844 --> 00:09:16,498
the most famous librarian
of all time.

202
00:09:16,542 --> 00:09:17,934
He has his own decimal system.

203
00:09:17,978 --> 00:09:19,196
Well, I think
you're being generous

204
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,589
with the word "famous."

205
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:25,594
Okay, so in the new world order,

206
00:09:25,638 --> 00:09:27,117
there's just enough
magic in the air

207
00:09:27,161 --> 00:09:29,598
to keep the boring masses
fat and happy,

208
00:09:29,642 --> 00:09:31,644
but you got an itch
to do something bigger,

209
00:09:31,687 --> 00:09:34,037
you have to file a request
with the Library.

210
00:09:34,081 --> 00:09:36,039
They decide if you're
trustworthy, and they give you

211
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,954
a cute little battery
in the shape of a coin.

212
00:09:37,998 --> 00:09:40,217
They put the faces of famous
librarians on there,

213
00:09:40,261 --> 00:09:42,829
but Dewey's the only one
people can remember.

214
00:09:42,872 --> 00:09:46,876
Well, and Laura Bush,
but Bushes just never stuck.

215
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,878
All right, well,
we'll pay the bounty ourselves.

216
00:09:49,836 --> 00:09:51,054
How are you gonna get Dewey's?

217
00:09:51,098 --> 00:09:52,578
I don't know.
We'll figure it out.

218
00:09:52,621 --> 00:09:54,057
We always...
Sometimes.

219
00:09:54,101 --> 00:09:56,625
Most of the time we do.

220
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,849
Five Deweys
to make it worth the delay,

221
00:10:02,892 --> 00:10:04,981
and know that I have trackers
on all of you,

222
00:10:05,025 --> 00:10:08,245
so if you try to run,
it won't go your way.

223
00:10:13,729 --> 00:10:15,078
Don't drink all my beer.

224
00:10:24,479 --> 00:10:26,046
Seems like this is the place.

225
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:27,395
It is.

226
00:10:27,438 --> 00:10:30,180
Those are maenads,
Bacchus followers.

227
00:10:30,224 --> 00:10:31,486
Get to it, then.

228
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:37,231
Oh, and if they have pizza,
bring me some.

229
00:10:42,497 --> 00:10:44,151
We can still find a way out.

230
00:10:44,194 --> 00:10:45,326
We already did.
This is it.

231
00:10:45,369 --> 00:10:47,067
We're doing it right now.

232
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:48,547
You had a weapon that
could have stopped him,

233
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,461
and instead of using it,
you gave it to him.

234
00:10:50,505 --> 00:10:51,593
We tried that already

235
00:10:51,637 --> 00:10:53,247
with Julia's god-killing bullet.

236
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,596
All it did was kill
the monster's host,

237
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,119
which in this case is Eliot.

238
00:10:56,163 --> 00:10:58,600
Who, for all we know, is dead.

239
00:11:01,385 --> 00:11:03,170
Or he's trapped in there,

240
00:11:03,213 --> 00:11:04,954
forced to watch everything
the monster does,

241
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,261
just waiting for us
to find a way to help him.

242
00:11:09,524 --> 00:11:11,657
What are you gonna
slip the ambrosia into?

243
00:11:13,702 --> 00:11:17,271
I guess I'll make a Fillorian
version of his favorite drink.

244
00:11:17,314 --> 00:11:20,143
Margarita, but instead of
salt on the rim, it will be...

245
00:11:20,187 --> 00:11:22,015
God meth. Perfect.

246
00:11:22,058 --> 00:11:25,279
Now go poison his ass so we can
get out of this malarial swamp.

247
00:11:25,322 --> 00:11:26,585
You know what's incredible?

248
00:11:26,628 --> 00:11:28,325
How you can be
such a good friend

249
00:11:28,369 --> 00:11:30,371
and such a terrible friend
at the exact same time.

250
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:39,249
There's not a lot

251
00:11:39,293 --> 00:11:41,991
that I can relate to
in this world.

252
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,647
People here are...

253
00:11:45,691 --> 00:11:49,651
well, people, generally,

254
00:11:49,695 --> 00:11:52,480
and me, not so much.

255
00:11:52,523 --> 00:11:54,308
But I relate to you.

256
00:11:57,093 --> 00:11:58,747
I hate being alone.

257
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,968
I don't like being left
with my own thoughts,

258
00:12:02,011 --> 00:12:03,665
such as they are.

259
00:12:05,711 --> 00:12:07,190
I need friends.

260
00:12:07,234 --> 00:12:08,496
One way of making friends

261
00:12:08,539 --> 00:12:10,498
is not murdering
everyone you meet.

262
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,718
Yes, you get my dilemma,

263
00:12:12,761 --> 00:12:13,762
but you're like me.

264
00:12:13,806 --> 00:12:15,503
Josh said so.

265
00:12:15,546 --> 00:12:18,158
A bad friend and a good friend
at the same time.

266
00:12:18,201 --> 00:12:19,159
How do you do it?

267
00:12:19,202 --> 00:12:20,551
I have no choice.

268
00:12:21,814 --> 00:12:25,600
You were friends with Eliot.

269
00:12:26,688 --> 00:12:29,125
Very best friends.

270
00:12:29,169 --> 00:12:30,692
Now you can be friends with me.

271
00:12:30,736 --> 00:12:32,346
It'll be the same.

272
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:34,391
You can show me
how to be more like him.

273
00:12:34,435 --> 00:12:36,698
No.

274
00:12:36,742 --> 00:12:38,526
I love Eliot.

275
00:12:38,569 --> 00:12:40,659
I would do anything for him,
even help you,

276
00:12:40,702 --> 00:12:43,052
but you and I,
we won't ever be friends...

277
00:12:44,575 --> 00:12:47,100
Unless you let me talk to him.

278
00:12:47,143 --> 00:12:49,450
Prove he's still alive in there.

279
00:12:49,493 --> 00:12:51,104
I can't do that.

280
00:12:51,147 --> 00:12:53,497
But you could let him go.

281
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:56,326
You could choose a new body.

282
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,676
But I like this one.

283
00:12:59,329 --> 00:13:02,028
I like the way
people look at me,

284
00:13:02,071 --> 00:13:04,639
and you and your friends

285
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:07,424
care so deeply
about what happens to it.

286
00:13:07,468 --> 00:13:09,818
Why would I ever leave it?

287
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,436
Hi.

288
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,134
I'm here to see Bacchus.

289
00:13:21,177 --> 00:13:23,440
Um, yeah... I don't know
what you're talking about.

290
00:13:23,484 --> 00:13:25,442
Um, it's... it's Ember, s...

291
00:13:25,486 --> 00:13:28,228
"Bacchanal" is the word
you're looking for.

292
00:13:28,271 --> 00:13:29,577
Cut the crap, Shoshana.

293
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,752
It's me, Josh,
from the Bedsty party.

294
00:13:30,796 --> 00:13:32,493
Come on.
Oh, I-

295
00:13:32,536 --> 00:13:33,581
I didn't think
you'd remember me.

296
00:13:34,669 --> 00:13:35,757
Well, it's actually... you know,

297
00:13:35,801 --> 00:13:37,324
it's really good
that you're here,

298
00:13:37,367 --> 00:13:40,414
'cause he's been darker
the last few weeks.

299
00:13:40,457 --> 00:13:42,242
I think a friendly face
could really help.

300
00:13:42,285 --> 00:13:43,634
Great.

301
00:13:46,463 --> 00:13:47,595
Hey, Q?

302
00:13:47,638 --> 00:13:49,553
- Oh, my...
- Oh, my God.

303
00:13:49,597 --> 00:13:51,512
Hey.

304
00:13:51,555 --> 00:13:53,166
Where have you been?
We couldn't find you.

305
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:54,558
"Enrolled at Brakebills,"
she said,

306
00:13:54,602 --> 00:13:56,169
fully aware of the irony.

307
00:13:56,212 --> 00:13:58,432
I just, um...

308
00:13:59,825 --> 00:14:01,478
I don't know where to start.
Uh...

309
00:14:02,784 --> 00:14:04,351
Have you heard
anything about Alice?

310
00:14:04,394 --> 00:14:05,787
No.

311
00:14:05,831 --> 00:14:07,528
No, I mean, not since
she completely

312
00:14:07,571 --> 00:14:09,269
screwed us over
at Blackspire, why?

313
00:14:09,312 --> 00:14:10,749
Where is everyone else?

314
00:14:11,924 --> 00:14:14,622
If the Library's
going to arrest us on sight,

315
00:14:14,665 --> 00:14:17,712
how do we get one of these
coins, much less five?

316
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:20,846
I asked around,
so there might be another way.

317
00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:24,806
The Library's official story
is that the McAllister family

318
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,765
heroically turned magic back on.

319
00:14:26,808 --> 00:14:30,769
So they gave them a free pass
to as many coins as they want.

320
00:14:30,812 --> 00:14:32,683
They give them
these special cards

321
00:14:32,727 --> 00:14:34,468
with no limits,
no questions asked.

322
00:14:34,511 --> 00:14:35,643
Only a few of them exist,
and Hedges

323
00:14:35,686 --> 00:14:36,644
are calling them Black Cards.

324
00:14:36,687 --> 00:14:37,776
We could steal one.

325
00:14:37,819 --> 00:14:39,429
If you steal a credit card,

326
00:14:39,473 --> 00:14:41,475
it only works until
it's reported stolen.

327
00:14:41,518 --> 00:14:42,650
With something this valuable,

328
00:14:42,693 --> 00:14:44,304
it's gonna happen
pretty damn quick.

329
00:14:44,347 --> 00:14:45,566
Forgery, maybe?

330
00:14:45,609 --> 00:14:47,133
Good enough to fool the Library?

331
00:14:47,176 --> 00:14:49,439
I used to know a guy,
a master counterfeiter.

332
00:14:49,483 --> 00:14:50,701
The Beast killed him, but...

333
00:14:50,745 --> 00:14:52,486
But that was in your timeline.

334
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:54,662
I did know Franky
since before Brakebills,

335
00:14:54,705 --> 00:14:56,882
so hopefully your Penny did too.

336
00:14:56,925 --> 00:15:00,363
And hopefully
he has the same number.

337
00:15:02,365 --> 00:15:04,498
Damn it.

338
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:06,195
I still have the DJ's phone.

339
00:15:08,894 --> 00:15:10,330
Well, the good news
is your Penny

340
00:15:10,373 --> 00:15:11,679
has the same password as me,

341
00:15:11,722 --> 00:15:13,550
so I'm downloading
his contacts right now.

342
00:15:13,594 --> 00:15:16,466
Ugh.
So many Insta notifications.

343
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:18,164
Okay, I got his number.
I'll try him.

344
00:15:18,207 --> 00:15:19,600
I can't log in.

345
00:15:19,643 --> 00:15:20,819
It wants to send a text message

346
00:15:20,862 --> 00:15:22,342
to my old phone to confirm,

347
00:15:22,385 --> 00:15:23,560
but if I had my old phone,

348
00:15:23,604 --> 00:15:25,606
why the hell
would I be doing this?

349
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:28,348
Have you talked
to your dad lately?

350
00:15:28,391 --> 00:15:30,567
I called him from Brian's phone,

351
00:15:30,611 --> 00:15:32,265
but nobody picked up.

352
00:15:32,308 --> 00:15:33,614
Nobody answers their phone

353
00:15:33,657 --> 00:15:35,268
when they don't recognize
the number, right?

354
00:15:35,311 --> 00:15:36,878
You're probably right.

355
00:15:36,922 --> 00:15:38,575
Guys, he picked up.

356
00:15:42,231 --> 00:15:43,842
Oh, I don't think
you can park there.

357
00:15:43,885 --> 00:15:45,887
Yeah, I don't think he cares.

358
00:15:45,931 --> 00:15:48,716
Shit just always seems
to work out for Franky.

359
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:50,326
Another timeline?

360
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:51,675
That's wild.

361
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:53,416
I thought you were dead.
Likewise.

362
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,983
So the Franky I knew
was a counterfeiter.

363
00:15:55,027 --> 00:15:57,290
So am I, but for most jobs,

364
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,726
my skills are overkill.

365
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:01,555
Duping objects to fool
regular dopes is simple.

366
00:16:01,598 --> 00:16:03,731
99% of the art you see
in museums is fake,

367
00:16:03,774 --> 00:16:05,559
because why waste the real thing

368
00:16:05,602 --> 00:16:07,300
on people who can't tell
the difference anyway?

369
00:16:07,343 --> 00:16:08,823
Fooling Magicians, though,

370
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:10,912
that's where the special sauce
comes in.

371
00:16:10,956 --> 00:16:12,348
So what's the MacGuffin?

372
00:16:12,392 --> 00:16:13,654
A Library Black Card.

373
00:16:15,438 --> 00:16:17,223
That's gonna take
a lot of sauce.

374
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:19,965
You know what?
Let me get that.

375
00:16:20,008 --> 00:16:21,270
That's probably for me.

376
00:16:25,927 --> 00:16:27,624
- Congratulations...
- Not now, guys.

377
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,541
You know what?

378
00:16:31,585 --> 00:16:32,542
Actually, I'm gonna grab...

379
00:16:32,586 --> 00:16:33,761
Thank you. Thanks.

380
00:16:33,804 --> 00:16:34,849
Have a good one.

381
00:16:40,463 --> 00:16:42,335
Are you gonna explain that,
or...

382
00:16:42,378 --> 00:16:44,337
- Are they even your size?
- They're always my size.

383
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:47,253
Anyway, uh, Library Black Card.

384
00:16:47,296 --> 00:16:48,602
That's tricky, but I can do it.

385
00:16:48,645 --> 00:16:50,691
Yeah, what'll it cost us?

386
00:16:50,734 --> 00:16:52,954
Whatever you're withdrawing
from the Library,

387
00:16:52,998 --> 00:16:54,695
double it.

388
00:16:54,738 --> 00:16:56,566
Ten Dewey coins?

389
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,655
That's like "raise an army
of the dead" level magic.

390
00:16:58,699 --> 00:17:00,266
That is a big ask.
Yeah.

391
00:17:00,309 --> 00:17:02,833
If my forgery works,
it won't matter.

392
00:17:02,877 --> 00:17:04,966
Now, I'm gonna need some stuff.

393
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:07,055
I'm gonna need at least two
minutes with a real Black Card

394
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:09,579
to use as a mold,
two Philly cheesesteaks,

395
00:17:09,623 --> 00:17:12,843
four liters of cherry soda,
not store brand...

396
00:17:12,887 --> 00:17:14,802
that's a deal breaker.
I know. I know.

397
00:17:14,845 --> 00:17:15,977
And at least a third
of a Dewey coin

398
00:17:16,021 --> 00:17:17,457
to get us started.

399
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,459
You need a battery
to get more batteries?

400
00:17:19,502 --> 00:17:21,678
Yeah.
Call it, uh, seed magic.

401
00:17:21,722 --> 00:17:23,811
Oh, uh...
we can't exactly

402
00:17:23,854 --> 00:17:25,944
walk into the Library
and just ask for one.

403
00:17:25,987 --> 00:17:28,337
Well, there's a game of Push
happening tonight.

404
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,425
What's Push?

405
00:17:29,469 --> 00:17:30,905
It's a card game.

406
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:32,820
High rollers play for Deweys,

407
00:17:32,863 --> 00:17:34,691
but you can buy in for less.

408
00:17:34,735 --> 00:17:36,737
Any of you good at cards?

409
00:17:43,091 --> 00:17:45,702
A Magic card game is hard
under normal circumstances,

410
00:17:45,746 --> 00:17:46,834
but right now the Library's

411
00:17:46,877 --> 00:17:47,835
only putting out enough magic

412
00:17:47,878 --> 00:17:49,184
for small-scale spells.

413
00:17:49,228 --> 00:17:51,839
I mean, one big transformation,

414
00:17:51,882 --> 00:17:54,015
and I'm gonna black out
the entire room.

415
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:55,321
Yeah, it's about efficiency.

416
00:17:55,364 --> 00:17:57,105
Some Magicians are semi trucks,

417
00:17:57,149 --> 00:17:58,933
guzzling magic
to do a simple spell.

418
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:00,804
Some of us are Priuses.

419
00:18:00,848 --> 00:18:02,415
What are you?

420
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,112
A sensible, mid-sized...

421
00:18:04,156 --> 00:18:05,940
What was the one that would
always explode?

422
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,202
Yeah, that.

423
00:18:07,246 --> 00:18:09,161
Hey, can we back him up?

424
00:18:11,032 --> 00:18:13,078
No, no, not... not me.

425
00:18:13,121 --> 00:18:14,470
I can't even make a spark.

426
00:18:14,514 --> 00:18:17,038
I'm... well, I'm...
kind of persona non grata

427
00:18:17,082 --> 00:18:19,214
at Push games
in this city, so...

428
00:18:19,258 --> 00:18:20,433
I just don't want to.

429
00:18:20,476 --> 00:18:21,912
It's a one-on-one game, anyway,

430
00:18:21,956 --> 00:18:23,044
so no backup.

431
00:18:23,088 --> 00:18:25,177
But, uh, good luck.

432
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,397
What do you have to wager?

433
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,052
It's a protection amulet.

434
00:18:31,096 --> 00:18:32,097
It's sort of all-purpose.

435
00:18:36,144 --> 00:18:37,885
It's not good enough.

436
00:18:37,928 --> 00:18:40,496
If you can't buy in,
make room for somebody who can.

437
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,412
Uh, wait.
Um, he's a Traveler.

438
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:48,200
I'll wager his exclusive
services for 48 hours.

439
00:18:48,243 --> 00:18:49,549
- A year.
- A month

440
00:18:49,592 --> 00:18:51,072
- Whoa, hold on.
- I won't lose.

441
00:18:51,116 --> 00:18:53,074
But you're a loser.

442
00:18:53,118 --> 00:18:54,989
A month.
No questions asked.

443
00:18:56,251 --> 00:18:58,340
Welcome to the game.

444
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:09,482
Kay, the rules of Push
are simple.

445
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:10,526
It's like the game War.

446
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:11,788
Two players.

447
00:19:11,832 --> 00:19:13,007
Each draws a card.

448
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,965
High card wins the hand.

449
00:19:15,009 --> 00:19:16,837
When the deck is gone,
the game's over.

450
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,274
But the real art of the game
is knowing how to cheat.

451
00:19:24,453 --> 00:19:26,412
See, a... a shuffled deck of cards

452
00:19:26,455 --> 00:19:28,022
is not a fixed thing.

453
00:19:28,066 --> 00:19:29,850
It's a cloud of possibilities...

454
00:19:34,202 --> 00:19:36,509
And you can change the odds
if you know how.

455
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:50,044
Put the right card
into your hand,

456
00:19:50,088 --> 00:19:52,307
or the wrong card
into your opponents.

457
00:20:07,192 --> 00:20:08,149
Wait, what is that?

458
00:20:10,891 --> 00:20:12,153
Rules of Poker.

459
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:18,072
You'll have to beat
three opponents

460
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:19,378
to win the whole thing.

461
00:20:19,421 --> 00:20:21,249
Shall we?

462
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:32,347
The more probability spells
that you throw around,

463
00:20:32,391 --> 00:20:35,524
the more improbable
things can get.

464
00:20:39,963 --> 00:20:41,356
Be careful of those.

465
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,879
They killed Bobby Darin.

466
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:50,191
The final round is when
you play for the Dewey.

467
00:21:32,712 --> 00:21:34,583
Breaking a tie is complicated.

468
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:36,019
Get the hats.

469
00:21:36,063 --> 00:21:37,760
You throw cards into a hat,

470
00:21:37,804 --> 00:21:40,154
and whichever you sink,
you score like a poker hand.

471
00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:56,257
Straight flush.

472
00:22:00,783 --> 00:22:03,264
I'm just saying,
what if he loses?

473
00:22:03,308 --> 00:22:04,483
I'm a Traveler.

474
00:22:04,526 --> 00:22:06,180
I'll grab the coin
and blip away.

475
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:08,269
Yeah, and then the people
you just robbed

476
00:22:08,313 --> 00:22:10,228
hunt you down and torture you.

477
00:22:10,271 --> 00:22:12,360
So why don't we save that
for plan B?

478
00:22:13,796 --> 00:22:16,451
Listen, if you lose
this last hand,

479
00:22:16,495 --> 00:22:17,452
it's over.

480
00:22:17,496 --> 00:22:18,453
I think we need

481
00:22:18,497 --> 00:22:19,454
to be ready for plan B.

482
00:22:38,168 --> 00:22:40,258
What is the point
of this display?

483
00:22:46,176 --> 00:22:49,049
You've used up all
the ambient magic in the room.

484
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,493
I guess we'll just
have to play an honest game.

485
00:23:21,255 --> 00:23:22,343
Got it.
Perfect.

486
00:23:22,387 --> 00:23:23,823
Now the easy part.

487
00:23:23,866 --> 00:23:25,781
Borrow a Black Card
to use as a template.

488
00:23:28,393 --> 00:23:30,438
- Anything?
- No.

489
00:23:32,701 --> 00:23:34,312
Why are we going along
with this?

490
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,489
Marina killed my mother.

491
00:23:37,532 --> 00:23:38,838
That was a different Marina.

492
00:23:38,881 --> 00:23:41,144
How different?

493
00:23:41,188 --> 00:23:43,321
Are we just gonna
hand her a nuclear bomb?

494
00:23:43,364 --> 00:23:44,800
What's the alternative?

495
00:23:44,844 --> 00:23:46,846
We use it against her.

496
00:23:46,889 --> 00:23:49,370
Where does that end?

497
00:23:49,414 --> 00:23:52,155
I'm... I came here to get away
from that kind of shit.

498
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:54,244
You know,
I'm getting really sick

499
00:23:54,288 --> 00:23:55,768
of being the voice
in the back of the room

500
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:58,248
that everyone ignores.

501
00:23:58,292 --> 00:24:00,381
The other me, Sam,

502
00:24:00,425 --> 00:24:02,383
did whatever
she thought was right,

503
00:24:02,427 --> 00:24:04,167
regardless of what
anybody else thought.

504
00:24:04,211 --> 00:24:06,648
I get it...

505
00:24:06,692 --> 00:24:09,869
because where I came from,
everyone I cared about is dead.

506
00:24:10,696 --> 00:24:12,480
No other voice
to listen to but mine.

507
00:24:13,655 --> 00:24:16,658
But maybe Sam didn't care
what anyone else thought

508
00:24:16,702 --> 00:24:17,833
because she was alone.

509
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:20,662
You aren't.

510
00:24:26,276 --> 00:24:27,408
Whoa.

511
00:24:27,452 --> 00:24:29,149
I got something here.

512
00:24:29,192 --> 00:24:32,413
There's huge energy
coming off her purse.

513
00:24:32,457 --> 00:24:34,284
It's gotta be the Black Card
in there.

514
00:24:34,328 --> 00:24:35,329
Showtime.

515
00:24:39,289 --> 00:24:40,639
Oh, excuse me, I'm...

516
00:24:41,596 --> 00:24:42,684
I'm... I'm sorry.

517
00:24:42,728 --> 00:24:44,120
Do I know you from somewhere?

518
00:24:44,164 --> 00:24:46,775
I mean, I dabbled in acting.

519
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:49,169
What have I seen you in?

520
00:24:49,212 --> 00:24:53,347
Let's just say some
provocative films of the 1970s.

521
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:55,218
Interesting.

522
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:12,627
All finished.

523
00:25:12,671 --> 00:25:14,324
Great.
Let's go.

524
00:25:14,368 --> 00:25:16,326
Uh, there is one little thing.

525
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:18,720
That special sauce
I was talking about before.

526
00:25:18,764 --> 00:25:21,593
Most forgers use
complicated illusion work.

527
00:25:21,636 --> 00:25:23,812
That's not quite my thing.

528
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:36,651
Did a bird just bring you
a sandwich?

529
00:25:36,695 --> 00:25:38,479
Yeah, I guess she did.

530
00:25:38,523 --> 00:25:39,959
You want it?

531
00:25:40,002 --> 00:25:42,265
Well, I mean, yeah, but...

532
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:43,789
But what the fuck, Franky?

533
00:25:43,832 --> 00:25:45,225
This is what I'm talking about.

534
00:25:45,268 --> 00:25:47,183
Luck is my discipline.

535
00:25:47,227 --> 00:25:48,750
The forgeries I make
give whoever's holding them

536
00:25:48,794 --> 00:25:50,273
insanely good luck.

537
00:25:50,317 --> 00:25:51,579
So nobody even bothers to check

538
00:25:51,623 --> 00:25:53,233
if the thing is fake.

539
00:25:53,276 --> 00:25:54,669
I've done the spellwork
so many times,

540
00:25:54,713 --> 00:25:56,932
I'm just sort of encrusted
with it.

541
00:25:56,976 --> 00:25:59,631
Luck is zero-sum,
so all that bad luck

542
00:25:59,674 --> 00:26:01,241
has got to go somewhere.

543
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,376
It goes into a bear?

544
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:09,467
Somebody, not me,
has to hold that

545
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,686
while the others bring
the Black Card to the Library.

546
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:15,473
And whoever's holding it
is gonna have a bad day.

547
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:17,779
- I'll do it.
- No, Jules.

548
00:26:17,823 --> 00:26:19,738
You don't have to. He...
It's-it's okay.

549
00:26:20,956 --> 00:26:24,873
It's hard to explain,
but I'm kind of bulletproof.

550
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,745
If anybody should have
terrible luck,

551
00:26:26,788 --> 00:26:28,268
it should be me.

552
00:26:28,311 --> 00:26:29,399
Why are you bulletproof?

553
00:26:29,443 --> 00:26:31,706
That's none of your business.

554
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,360
Pick it up.

555
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:43,239
No, no, no, no, no, no,
something's wrong.

556
00:26:43,283 --> 00:26:45,024
Uh, whatever
"none of my business" shit

557
00:26:45,067 --> 00:26:46,547
is going on with you,
it's interfering

558
00:26:46,591 --> 00:26:48,810
with the fortune spell,
so set it down.

559
00:26:48,854 --> 00:26:50,856
Set it down!
All right.

560
00:26:50,899 --> 00:26:52,031
Dahh...

561
00:26:53,902 --> 00:26:55,904
Looks like you just volunteered.

562
00:27:06,567 --> 00:27:07,699
You awake?

563
00:27:07,742 --> 00:27:08,917
Nope.

564
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:10,919
It's time.

565
00:27:50,002 --> 00:27:52,918
Anti-magic paint
on a magic lock.

566
00:27:52,961 --> 00:27:54,484
Wish I had thought of that
before those

567
00:27:54,528 --> 00:27:56,661
book-sniffing bastards
ruined Christmas.

568
00:27:56,704 --> 00:27:57,966
Shh.

569
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,972
Which way now?

570
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,452
I don't know.
Something isn't right.

571
00:28:05,495 --> 00:28:07,367
This should continue straight.

572
00:28:08,542 --> 00:28:09,848
Well, you made this map

573
00:28:09,891 --> 00:28:11,632
by mind-controlling a cockroach.

574
00:28:11,676 --> 00:28:12,894
Shouldn't we trust our eyes

575
00:28:12,938 --> 00:28:15,375
rather than some
shit-eating bug?

576
00:28:17,551 --> 00:28:19,379
No, I think it's an illusion.

577
00:28:19,422 --> 00:28:21,033
There's spellwork on this wall.

578
00:28:34,002 --> 00:28:35,395
Or it's a wall.

579
00:28:50,715 --> 00:28:52,978
This is it.
The books of everyone.

580
00:28:53,021 --> 00:28:55,415
You look for yours, and I'll
go look for my friends'.

581
00:28:56,895 --> 00:28:59,680
I gotta tell you,
it is such a relief

582
00:28:59,724 --> 00:29:01,856
to take off that Ember disguise.

583
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,553
So what have I been missing
down on Earth?

584
00:29:03,597 --> 00:29:04,685
It must be bad.

585
00:29:04,729 --> 00:29:06,948
Your chakras are all fucked up.

586
00:29:06,992 --> 00:29:08,602
Oh, yeah.

587
00:29:08,646 --> 00:29:11,039
Uh, we got magic turned back on.

588
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,084
Hey.

589
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:13,563
And, you know,

590
00:29:13,607 --> 00:29:15,914
one of our friends
just betrayed us...

591
00:29:16,741 --> 00:29:18,960
Which is crazy, right?

592
00:29:19,004 --> 00:29:21,702
Like, who would do that?

593
00:29:21,746 --> 00:29:23,486
- Yeah.
- I got mind wiped.

594
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:24,792
Yeah, I was living

595
00:29:24,836 --> 00:29:27,882
as this other dude
named Isaac for months.

596
00:29:27,926 --> 00:29:30,580
Um... that is exactly

597
00:29:30,624 --> 00:29:32,713
kind of close to my situation.

598
00:29:33,583 --> 00:29:37,109
So I'm being hunted
by this douchebag monster,

599
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,589
and, like, I need a place
to crash, right?

600
00:29:39,633 --> 00:29:41,113
That's when I remember

601
00:29:41,156 --> 00:29:42,854
that squirrely little
human friend of yours

602
00:29:42,897 --> 00:29:45,683
said that he killed Ember,

603
00:29:45,726 --> 00:29:48,076
and I'm like, "I could
take that guy's place."

604
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,426
Live to fuck another day,
you know?

605
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:51,906
It's kind of nice, you know?

606
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:56,084
Freeing to... to live as
someone else for a little bit.

607
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:57,912
Yeah, I guess.

608
00:29:57,956 --> 00:30:01,916
You know,
a famous cocksman once told me,

609
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,744
"Once you've had quantity,

610
00:30:03,788 --> 00:30:06,181
the only thing left
is strange."

611
00:30:07,487 --> 00:30:10,229
And, boy, is this place
full of strange.

612
00:30:10,272 --> 00:30:13,145
I mean, Isaac's life was great.

613
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:17,453
Lot of friends,
big, uh... family.

614
00:30:19,064 --> 00:30:21,806
But eventually, it...
it all ends,

615
00:30:21,849 --> 00:30:23,895
and your old life,

616
00:30:23,938 --> 00:30:26,636
your old problems,

617
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,942
they catch up to you.

618
00:30:27,986 --> 00:30:29,639
Or your problems never find you

619
00:30:29,683 --> 00:30:31,206
and the party goes on forever.

620
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:34,470
Oh, look at that, I'm dry.

621
00:30:34,514 --> 00:30:37,560
Is that... did you make for me?

622
00:30:37,604 --> 00:30:39,737
- Yes.
- Josh special?

623
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:42,130
Uh, yes.
I... I made it for you.

624
00:30:42,174 --> 00:30:46,526
You and me, Joshy,
we're the same.

625
00:30:46,569 --> 00:30:48,789
We're born to be
the perfect hosts.

626
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:51,966
We want everyone around us
to have a good time.

627
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:53,663
We make sure of it.

628
00:30:53,707 --> 00:30:55,753
Nobody does the same for us.

629
00:30:55,796 --> 00:30:56,928
Mm-mm.

630
00:30:56,971 --> 00:30:59,669
This is to Josh, not to Isaac.

631
00:30:59,713 --> 00:31:00,975
This is to the real you.

632
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,939
I'm sorry.

633
00:31:07,982 --> 00:31:10,811
I... I pee-peed in it,

634
00:31:10,855 --> 00:31:13,074
and you don't...
you don't drink that.

635
00:31:13,118 --> 00:31:14,293
So...

636
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:19,777
This the dumbest plan.

637
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,822
Franky says the disguises
won't matter.

638
00:31:21,866 --> 00:31:25,130
If the Black Card works,
nobody will question them.

639
00:31:25,173 --> 00:31:26,958
I feel like an idiot.

640
00:31:27,001 --> 00:31:28,698
Excuse me, sir.

641
00:31:28,742 --> 00:31:30,613
You have a fresh look.

642
00:31:30,657 --> 00:31:32,224
Have you considered modeling?

643
00:31:35,662 --> 00:31:37,838
Kay, it's just soup.

644
00:31:39,057 --> 00:31:41,102
Can't choke.
It's not scalding.

645
00:31:41,146 --> 00:31:42,843
It's totally safe.

646
00:31:46,368 --> 00:31:49,241
Oh, look at that line.
This is gonna take forever.

647
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:50,764
I've been thinking,
while we're here,

648
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:52,244
we should get a bit extra.

649
00:31:52,287 --> 00:31:55,987
Five for Marina,
five for Franky, ten for us.

650
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:59,207
We'd have to be insanely
lucky to get that much.

651
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:02,907
The more luck we get,
the more bad luck Quentin gets.

652
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,604
When this is over,
the McAllisters

653
00:32:04,647 --> 00:32:06,562
will still be after us.

654
00:32:06,606 --> 00:32:11,045
We'll need to do
some major cloaking spell.

655
00:32:11,089 --> 00:32:12,699
It could kill him.

656
00:32:12,742 --> 00:32:14,875
Hey!
There's a truck outside

657
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:16,572
giving out free ice cream!

658
00:32:18,313 --> 00:32:21,360
I mean,
two extra coins can't hurt.

659
00:32:23,884 --> 00:32:25,930
It's... it's all good.
Soup spills all the time.

660
00:32:25,973 --> 00:32:27,932
Thanks.

661
00:32:27,975 --> 00:32:29,977
Damn it.

662
00:32:30,021 --> 00:32:33,024
How the hell do you get
a paper cut from a paper towel?

663
00:32:33,067 --> 00:32:35,243
- Welcome.
- Hi.

664
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:38,812
So how can I help you today?

665
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:41,380
We need twelve contained
current coins.

666
00:32:45,123 --> 00:32:47,299
- Here.
- No, God.

667
00:32:47,342 --> 00:32:48,300
Keep it away.

668
00:32:51,956 --> 00:32:53,392
Everything looks in order.

669
00:32:53,435 --> 00:32:55,698
Just need to check
one little thing.

670
00:33:04,664 --> 00:33:05,621
Shoot.

671
00:33:09,669 --> 00:33:10,931
Did you hear something?

672
00:33:12,672 --> 00:33:14,935
Where did it come from?

673
00:33:14,979 --> 00:33:17,155
Out of the... toilet.

674
00:33:17,198 --> 00:33:19,244
All right, then,
I'll send this requisition

675
00:33:19,287 --> 00:33:21,724
to the home office,
and they'll return your coins.

676
00:33:29,863 --> 00:33:31,952
I thought you said
your phone wasn't working.

677
00:33:39,177 --> 00:33:41,309
It's a voicemail from my mom.

678
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:42,963
Do you think...

679
00:33:43,007 --> 00:33:44,747
Q.

680
00:33:44,791 --> 00:33:45,879
It's got to be about my dad.
I'm not gonna...

681
00:33:45,923 --> 00:33:46,924
No, Q, the bear.

682
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:52,886
Okay.

683
00:33:57,369 --> 00:33:58,979
Oh.

684
00:33:59,023 --> 00:34:00,894
Your request has been flagged

685
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:02,852
for follow-up with a supervisor.

686
00:34:02,896 --> 00:34:04,071
Wait here, please.

687
00:34:09,294 --> 00:34:10,860
A requisition follow-up for you.

688
00:34:10,904 --> 00:34:13,080
Christ, can it wait?

689
00:34:13,124 --> 00:34:14,255
Fine.

690
00:34:29,488 --> 00:34:31,620
Sorry, I can't see for shit.

691
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,886
This bloody thing's
making me crazy.

692
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:38,497
Do you mind?
No.

693
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,715
Do... do your thing.

694
00:34:41,326 --> 00:34:42,675
What do I do?

695
00:34:42,718 --> 00:34:44,851
Just, please, don't listen to it

696
00:34:44,894 --> 00:34:46,679
until we hear back
from Penny and Katie.

697
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:50,204
Oh, shit!

698
00:34:50,248 --> 00:34:53,425
Oh, Jesus Christ,
now I've got it in backwards.

699
00:34:56,602 --> 00:34:58,212
About those coins.

700
00:34:58,256 --> 00:35:00,388
Listen, the truth is,

701
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:01,955
the red tape, the paperwork,

702
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:04,479
it's, in my mind,
all just a wank.

703
00:35:04,523 --> 00:35:05,828
You guys gonna
blow yourselves up?

704
00:35:05,872 --> 00:35:07,265
- No.
- No?

705
00:35:07,308 --> 00:35:08,744
Great.

706
00:35:08,788 --> 00:35:12,574
Requested... approved.

707
00:35:17,623 --> 00:35:19,712
Sorry about the inconvenience.

708
00:35:19,755 --> 00:35:21,627
Thank you very much.
You have a good day.

709
00:35:24,717 --> 00:35:26,371
Jesus, shit.

710
00:35:27,502 --> 00:35:28,721
Okay, they did it.
Drop the bear!

711
00:35:31,985 --> 00:35:33,856
It really came out of the...

712
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,597
I don't want to talk about it.

713
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,037
Thank you, brother.

714
00:35:41,168 --> 00:35:42,430
I had a feeling
things would work out,

715
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:44,563
because they always do.

716
00:35:44,606 --> 00:35:46,521
By the way,
I'd destroy those ASAP.

717
00:35:46,565 --> 00:35:47,740
They'll be out of juice soon,

718
00:35:47,783 --> 00:35:49,959
but you don't want
to take any chances.

719
00:35:50,003 --> 00:35:51,570
I'm on it.

720
00:36:04,757 --> 00:36:07,368
You nutsacked out, didn't you?

721
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,546
Oh, well, "pussied out"
makes perfect sense here?

722
00:36:12,417 --> 00:36:14,636
Well, if you mean that
I couldn't go through with it,

723
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,377
then, yes, you're right.

724
00:36:16,421 --> 00:36:20,381
Josh, we don't
have a choice here.

725
00:36:20,425 --> 00:36:22,949
Now, where is the rest
of the Ambrosia?

726
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,561
Fine, but just know that Bacchus

727
00:36:26,605 --> 00:36:27,997
will never drink
anything you give him.

728
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:30,478
Oh, I'm not gonna
give it to Bacchus.

729
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:31,871
Yeah, I'm gonna
dump it in there.

730
00:36:31,914 --> 00:36:33,655
Everyone'll drink it.

731
00:36:33,699 --> 00:36:35,962
Are you nuts?
There are over 100 people here.

732
00:36:36,005 --> 00:36:37,964
You have no idea
what that will do to them.

733
00:36:38,007 --> 00:36:40,749
Well, I'm pretty sure
it'll fucking kill them.

734
00:36:40,793 --> 00:36:43,361
And I'll do it,
unless you start acting

735
00:36:43,404 --> 00:36:45,406
like a real pussy

736
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:48,931
and take one
for the fucking team.

737
00:36:50,803 --> 00:36:53,936
Hey, uh, I'm sorry about...

738
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:57,375
We've all peed in things
we regret.

739
00:36:59,507 --> 00:37:03,729
I know gods are supposed
to be distant and unknowable,

740
00:37:03,772 --> 00:37:05,774
but you're a good guy.

741
00:37:08,777 --> 00:37:10,431
I want to tell you a secret.

742
00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:18,613
What did you put... in this?

743
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:23,618
I found my book.

744
00:37:23,662 --> 00:37:24,880
Now let's get
the hell out of here.

745
00:37:24,924 --> 00:37:26,491
I can't find my friends' books.

746
00:37:27,796 --> 00:37:29,842
"The following books have been
removed from circulation

747
00:37:29,885 --> 00:37:32,323
for revisions.
Q. Coldwater, A. Quinn."

748
00:37:33,498 --> 00:37:35,891
They're filling in
the endings of our books...

749
00:37:35,935 --> 00:37:37,328
the pages that were missing

750
00:37:37,371 --> 00:37:38,851
because of the Great Blank Spot.

751
00:37:46,859 --> 00:37:47,860
Nick?

752
00:37:49,775 --> 00:37:51,864
Hey, I'm sorry about
your friends' books,

753
00:37:51,907 --> 00:37:53,996
but this is our chance.

754
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,434
Come with me.
I can't.

755
00:37:56,477 --> 00:37:58,827
I... I can't leave
without their books.

756
00:37:58,871 --> 00:38:00,655
Well, I want to do the...

757
00:38:00,699 --> 00:38:02,657
Look, just go, while
you still have the chance.

758
00:38:02,701 --> 00:38:04,833
Okay, I can find
the Revision Room on my own.

759
00:38:06,661 --> 00:38:08,663
For what it's worth,

760
00:38:08,707 --> 00:38:10,709
you're still on my Nice List.

761
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:32,034
The fuck?

762
00:38:48,442 --> 00:38:50,096
Do you remember me?

763
00:38:51,445 --> 00:38:53,099
Because I don't.

764
00:38:54,448 --> 00:38:57,930
I don't remember my name
or where I came from.

765
00:38:59,323 --> 00:39:01,760
But I remember you.

766
00:39:01,803 --> 00:39:05,546
You took something from me,
something important,

767
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:09,463
and then you...
threw me in a cage,

768
00:39:09,507 --> 00:39:13,815
and I would like
for you to explain.

769
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:16,557
You remember all that,

770
00:39:16,601 --> 00:39:19,299
but you don't remember
what you are,

771
00:39:19,343 --> 00:39:21,214
what you did.

772
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:23,434
The word "monster"
has been thrown around.

773
00:39:23,477 --> 00:39:25,262
That's right.

774
00:39:25,305 --> 00:39:27,829
We put you with
the rest of your kind.

775
00:39:28,961 --> 00:39:30,354
And I ate them.

776
00:39:30,397 --> 00:39:33,095
You're kind of making my case
for me here.

777
00:39:33,139 --> 00:39:35,446
We have the same parents.

778
00:39:35,489 --> 00:39:37,970
Why am I a monster
and you're a god?

779
00:39:38,013 --> 00:39:39,972
If you don't want
to be a monster,

780
00:39:40,015 --> 00:39:41,452
then let me go.

781
00:39:41,495 --> 00:39:43,018
Give me back
what you took from me,

782
00:39:43,062 --> 00:39:44,150
and maybe I will.

783
00:39:46,195 --> 00:39:48,850
I can't... ever.

784
00:39:48,894 --> 00:39:50,330
I'm sorry.

785
00:39:51,462 --> 00:39:53,202
It was a part of me,

786
00:39:53,246 --> 00:39:56,989
and now it's a part of you.

787
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:03,430
Burning in your body.

788
00:40:03,474 --> 00:40:05,127
Wait. Wait.

789
00:40:05,171 --> 00:40:07,216
This world needs me.

790
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,218
Its god is dead.

791
00:40:09,262 --> 00:40:11,090
You don't have to do this.

792
00:40:11,133 --> 00:40:13,353
There's others.
There's still time.

793
00:40:13,397 --> 00:40:15,268
We can figure something out.

794
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:16,835
It doesn't have to be me.

795
00:40:16,878 --> 00:40:19,490
It doesn't have to...

796
00:40:39,423 --> 00:40:41,642
What the fuck did he
just rip out of him?

797
00:40:41,686 --> 00:40:43,644
Whatever it is, to a fairy eye,

798
00:40:43,688 --> 00:40:46,908
it's like staring
straight at the sun.

799
00:40:50,085 --> 00:40:51,260
They're real.

800
00:40:53,088 --> 00:40:54,525
Well, it's been a pleasure.

801
00:40:56,091 --> 00:40:57,658
The trackers on us?

802
00:40:57,702 --> 00:40:59,530
Not actually a thing.

803
00:40:59,573 --> 00:41:01,662
You guys are too lawful good
to bitch out.

804
00:41:10,671 --> 00:41:12,630
- Marina.
- Hmm?

805
00:41:12,673 --> 00:41:14,632
I've been looking for you.

806
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:20,681
Excuse me, miss.

807
00:41:20,725 --> 00:41:22,204
These are free to a good home.

808
00:41:22,248 --> 00:41:23,554
Are you interested?

809
00:41:29,211 --> 00:41:31,083
Hey, are you sure
Marina's apartment's

810
00:41:31,126 --> 00:41:32,563
the safest place for us to meet?

811
00:41:32,606 --> 00:41:34,391
It's not Marina's.

812
00:41:35,261 --> 00:41:36,436
It's mine.

813
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,481
What did you do?

814
00:41:37,524 --> 00:41:39,091
I handled the problem.

815
00:41:39,134 --> 00:41:41,963
Now, can we do this
cloaking spell

816
00:41:42,007 --> 00:41:43,965
before the McAllisters show up
and kill all of us?

817
00:41:48,317 --> 00:41:49,928
Hey.

818
00:41:49,971 --> 00:41:52,104
You haven't listened?

819
00:41:52,147 --> 00:41:55,412
You know, your bad luck's gone.

820
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:57,718
Safe as it'll ever be.

821
00:41:57,762 --> 00:42:02,157
But that's not
what's really stopping you.

822
00:42:02,201 --> 00:42:04,508
The other me...

823
00:42:04,551 --> 00:42:06,988
Brian,

824
00:42:07,032 --> 00:42:09,426
his dad died when he was a kid.

825
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:13,081
He was too little
to even understand.

826
00:42:13,734 --> 00:42:16,128
All of his problems
were like that.

827
00:42:16,171 --> 00:42:17,608
No sharp edges.

828
00:42:17,651 --> 00:42:18,652
Yeah.

829
00:42:20,349 --> 00:42:22,439
Look at us.

830
00:42:22,482 --> 00:42:24,745
We paid a hell
of a fucking price.

831
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:28,662
You gave up being a goddess.

832
00:42:31,317 --> 00:42:33,275
I gave up my father.

833
00:42:38,324 --> 00:42:40,108
What did we get in return?

834
00:42:41,153 --> 00:42:42,197
Magic is back.

835
00:42:47,115 --> 00:42:49,509
Mm-mm, not in the way
that we wanted.

836
00:42:52,251 --> 00:42:55,297
How are you not furious?

837
00:42:58,562 --> 00:43:03,349
Because, for almost everyone,
the world is a little brighter,

838
00:43:03,392 --> 00:43:07,005
even if they never know why.

839
00:43:07,048 --> 00:43:10,225
I hate the Library
for what they did,

840
00:43:10,269 --> 00:43:14,360
but my part in it,
I knew what it cost.

841
00:43:15,709 --> 00:43:18,407
And I'd do it again.

842
00:43:22,847 --> 00:43:24,544
But you wouldn't.

843
00:43:27,678 --> 00:43:30,289
Will you sit here for a minute?

844
00:43:30,332 --> 00:43:31,551
Yeah.

845
00:43:34,815 --> 00:43:37,775
Hi, Quentin.

846
00:43:37,818 --> 00:43:40,691
Sorry to leave a message
with bad news.

847
00:43:42,475 --> 00:43:44,825
I need to talk to you
about your father.
