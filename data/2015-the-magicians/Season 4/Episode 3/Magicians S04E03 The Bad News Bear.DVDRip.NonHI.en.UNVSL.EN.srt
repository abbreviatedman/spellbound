00:00:01,134 --> 00:00:02,574
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,636 --> 00:00:04,298
Are you Santa Claus?

3
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:06,234
Well, I'm not, not that.

4
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:07,397
Magic's gone.

5
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:08,734
I'm not a magician,

6
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:10,344
but I could feel it
when it was gone,

7
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:11,730
and I knew it
wasn't a coincidence

8
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:14,314
when I went into
remission a week later.

9
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:15,776
What timeline are you from?

10
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,369
The one where you
owe me child support.

11
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:18,417
I'm kidding.

12
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:20,330
Okay, then if you want
me to help these students,

13
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:21,720
can you tell me who they are?

14
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:23,950
Their lives were
in grave danger.

15
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,426
<i>I cast a spell that erased their
identities and gave them new ones.</i>

16
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:28,872
I mean, isn't there
anything you can do?

17
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:31,195
If I reveal that the
spell can be reversed,

18
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:32,705
then someone would
reverse the spell.

19
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:40,467
Bacchus, what
are you doing here?

20
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,085
Why do you want everyone
thinking you're Ember?

21
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:43,702
Thanks for popping in.

22
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,069
Oh, my God.

23
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:47,439
<i>Mis hermanos.</i>

24
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,449
Where were you?
We looked everywhere.

25
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:50,745
Stay back. Why?

26
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,750
Because I'm not here to play.

27
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:56,583
Marina.

28
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,886
Why do you look like
you're fleeing something?

29
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:03,020
It's me, Margo,
previously known as Janet.

30
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:05,358
Look, I'm gonna do you a solid.

31
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:07,367
Don't go up there. Why?

32
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:09,835
Because there's an uninvited
guest in my apartment

33
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,202
who's probably killing
your friends right about now.

34
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:14,935
Look, I don't know what he
is, and I'm assuming it's a "he"

35
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,534
because this is some
toxically masculine behavior,

36
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:20,638
but he walked through
every ward and shield I had,

37
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:22,410
set off every alarm.

38
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,075
So, instead of going inside,

39
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:25,779
I'm gonna get a
breakfast burrito.

40
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,151
You wanna join?
We have to help them.

41
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:30,452
Oh. You're one of those.

42
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,950
Fine, you wanna
stick your neck out?

43
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:34,706
There's something
inside that can help you.

44
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:36,062
Do tell.

45
00:01:38,699 --> 00:01:40,031
No traveling.

46
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:41,526
Where to start?

47
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,594
Order is important
with these things.

48
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:46,799
Who goes first? Who goes last?

49
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:48,942
Oh, you keep looking at him.

50
00:01:50,243 --> 00:01:51,973
Because you don't
want him to die?

51
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:55,782
Which means he
has to go before you.

52
00:01:57,517 --> 00:01:58,951
You care about all of them.

53
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:00,987
So, you're last.

54
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:06,889
Thank Christ.

55
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,053
Wait, wait, wait.

56
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,359
Not Eliot.

57
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,763
<i>This thing has god-level power,</i>

58
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,369
and I have a bad
history with gods,

59
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:17,495
since apparently one killed me.

60
00:02:18,005 --> 00:02:19,005
No, it's fine.

61
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:21,612
Different me, but I didn't want
to get caught off guard again,

62
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:24,110
so I called in every favor I had

63
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:25,668
to build a defense system.

64
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,676
All you have to do is get
him to sit in the gold chair.

65
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:29,808
Why the gold chair?

66
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:31,383
Because it had to be something,

67
00:02:31,451 --> 00:02:33,249
<i>and everybody wants
to sit in the gold chair.</i>

68
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,481
<i>It's a total power move.</i>

69
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:37,483
I'm so glad you came.

70
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,759
Saves me having
to hunt you down.

71
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:42,659
I've got so much of that
ahead of me already.

72
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:44,954
What is he talking about?

73
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:47,931
He's, uh, hunting gods.

74
00:02:48,368 --> 00:02:51,463
It's vengeance for
locking you in the castle.

75
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:52,799
They did more than that,

76
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,008
and so did you.

77
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:57,300
You tried to kill me.

78
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,315
You were all part of it.

79
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:09,584
Then what?

80
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,722
There's a bell on the table.

81
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:12,882
Ring it.

82
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:16,522
And he explodes?

83
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:18,564
He gets a face full
of distilled ambrosia.

84
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:20,157
It's basically meth for gods.

85
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,168
<i>It gets them high,
but an overdose</i>

86
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:23,498
<i>will knock them on their asses.</i>

87
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:28,739
Tell me Eliot is still
in there somewhere.

88
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:30,175
Not that I've seen.

89
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,939
Your round, innocent face

90
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:35,244
will make your death
particularly upsetting,

91
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:37,613
so, I've decided
to start with you.

92
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:42,420
I can give you Bacchus.

93
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,092
You're hunting gods,

94
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,724
and I found him hiding
someplace far away.

95
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,664
Hiding from you, right?

96
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:57,028
I can take you there

97
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,334
if you let them live.

98
00:04:01,308 --> 00:04:02,435
All of them.

99
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,348
Perhaps we can
be friends after all.

100
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:27,935
So, where is everyone else?

101
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,299
I don't know.

102
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,765
You were supposed
to remain hidden.

103
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,902
I meant to protect you.

104
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,072
Doesn't really seem
like I need protection.

105
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,639
I mean, nothing
your spell threw at me

106
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:43,911
even left a scratch.

107
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,651
Reynard did say, even
without their powers,

108
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,949
gods are hard to kill.

109
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:53,124
I wouldn't underestimate
the will of Irene McAllistair.

110
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:55,320
Ah.

111
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,995
Tell a few people that
you're leaving forever,

112
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:00,260
and look what the
ungrateful bastards do.

113
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,865
Ah, yes.

114
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:05,878
You know, if the deal is broken

115
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,116
and the McAllistairs are coming,

116
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,420
I'm gonna have to warn everyone.

117
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:12,644
Contacting your friends will
put a target on their backs.

118
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:14,879
To be clear,

119
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:17,349
you put the target on our backs.

120
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,442
You betrayed us.

121
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,020
Hmm.

122
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:23,649
I sacrificed everything
to bring back magic.

123
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:26,390
You know what I sacrificed,

124
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:28,254
and look what you do with it.

125
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,629
Yes, Ms. Wicker,

126
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,934
I made a deal

127
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,665
with the goddamn Library,

128
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,169
and in doing so, I
saved your lives.

129
00:05:42,742 --> 00:05:44,821
Yeah, well, you're pretty
fucking quick to compromise,

130
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,040
you know that?

131
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:49,073
Now, I need to find my friends,

132
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:50,173
but I can't do magic,

133
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,845
so you're going to cast
the locator spell for me.

134
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,204
Dean Fogg. Finally.

135
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:17,744
I only have a moment.

136
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:21,142
You know how the Library

137
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:24,446
contains the books of
everyone who ever lived?

138
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:25,711
Yeah.

139
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,211
The Great Blank Spot is over.

140
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,755
The Library can update
their books again.

141
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,662
So, if your friends were
to get their memories back,

142
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:37,722
the Library would know.

143
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:39,657
They'd try to find them

144
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,929
to keep them safe

145
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,964
from the Monster that
you warned us about.

146
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:48,886
<i>You're telling me they
have books that describe</i>

147
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:52,504
every damn thing everyone
does or ever will do,

148
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,980
when you're sleeping,
when you're awake,

149
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:56,209
naughty or nice?

150
00:06:56,283 --> 00:06:58,309
You know how much time
that would have saved me?

151
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,644
Can we please not with
the Santa stuff right now?

152
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,212
Well, could you please not
with the angsty, nerdy stuff, huh?

153
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:05,252
No, 'cause that's who you are,

154
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,189
and I don't judge you for it.

155
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,900
Dean Fogg was trying
to give me a message.

156
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,831
Look, if we escape,
they'll just read our books,

157
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,498
find out where we
are, and come after us.

158
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,531
So, we just take
the books with us,

159
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:17,497
or destroy 'em.

160
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:20,139
But first we have
to actually escape.

161
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:23,809
I can get us to the fireplace.

162
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:26,573
Just be ready.

163
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:30,443
All I'm offering is a location.

164
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:31,917
The rest is on you.

165
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:33,920
Knowing where Bacchus is

166
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:35,853
doesn't help me if he runs away,

167
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:38,118
which he'll do the
second I show up.

168
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:39,916
You see my problem,

169
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:42,462
and how maybe it is
just easier to kill you all.

170
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:51,602
Do you know what this is?

171
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:02,173
Where did you get that?

172
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,751
I didn't,

173
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:07,129
but I know that enough of it
will mess up a god long enough

174
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,088
for you to do whatever
you need to do.

175
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,817
Excuse me, Margo?

176
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:12,322
Quick talk?

177
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:20,133
Could you stop volunteering?

178
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,235
I know Bacchus. He's a friend.

179
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:24,294
Great.

180
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:26,135
Then you'll poison him.

181
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:28,032
He'll never suspect a friend.

182
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:34,013
I could always kill you.

183
00:08:34,714 --> 00:08:36,273
Awesome.

184
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,349
Great choices.

185
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,346
Well, let's get going, then.

186
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,878
Guys, in case it
even needs to be said,

187
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:42,979
I know Marina.

188
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:44,319
She is not a helpful person.

189
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:45,950
So, just act accordingly.

190
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,260
Of course I'm getting paid.

191
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,977
The McAllistairs have
a bounty on your heads,

192
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:56,128
dead or alive.

193
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,636
The real yous,

194
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,229
not the witness-protection
identities.

195
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:01,069
So, you can see how
it'd be profitable for me

196
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:02,302
to get you back to normal.

197
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,375
What are they offering?

198
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:07,447
Three Deweys. What
the hell's a Dewey?

199
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:08,977
As in Melvil Dewey,

200
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:10,847
the most famous
librarian of all time.

201
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:12,117
He has his own decimal system.

202
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:14,619
Well, I think you're being
generous with the word "famous."

203
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:19,319
Okay, so in the New World Order,

204
00:09:19,926 --> 00:09:21,451
there is just enough
magic in the air

205
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:23,690
to keep the boring
masses fat and happy,

206
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:25,823
but you got an itch to
do something bigger,

207
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,232
you have to file a
request with the Library.

208
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,441
They decide if you're
trustworthy, and they give you

209
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:32,263
a cute little battery
in the shape of a coin.

210
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:34,705
They put the faces of
famous librarians on there,

211
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,534
but Dewey's the only
one people can remember.

212
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,703
Well, and Laura Bush,
but Bushes just never stuck.

213
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:43,328
All right, well, we'll pay
the bounty ourselves.

214
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:45,278
How are you gonna get Deweys?

215
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:46,862
I don't know.
We'll figure it out.

216
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,377
We always... Sometimes.

217
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:50,617
Most of the time, we do.

218
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,022
Five Deweys to make
it worth the delay,

219
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,275
and know that I have
trackers on all of you,

220
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:02,428
so if you try to run,
it won't go your way.

221
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:09,933
Don't drink all my beer.

222
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,044
Seems like this is the place.

223
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,316
It is.

224
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,914
Those are Maenads,
Bacchus followers.

225
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:26,685
Get to it, then.

226
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:31,995
Oh, and if they have
pizza, bring me some.

227
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,196
We can still find a way out.

228
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:41,935
We already did. This is
it. We're doing it right now.

229
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,486
You have a weapon that
could have stopped him,

230
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,445
and instead of using
it, you gave it to him.

231
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:48,038
We tried that already with
Julia's god-killing bullet.

232
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,592
All it did was kill
The Monster's host,

233
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:50,845
which in this case is Eliot.

234
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:53,519
Who, for all we know, is dead.

235
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:57,987
Or he's trapped in there,

236
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,802
forced to watch everything
The Monster does,

237
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,352
just waiting for us to
find a way to help him.

238
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:07,123
What are you gonna
slip the ambrosia into?

239
00:11:08,935 --> 00:11:12,269
I guess I'll make a Fillorian
version of his favorite drink,

240
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,967
margarita, but instead of
salt on the rim, it will be...

241
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,942
God meth. Perfect.

242
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,242
Now go poison his ass so we
can get out of this malarial swamp.

243
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:21,474
You know what's incredible?

244
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:22,880
How you can be
such a good friend

245
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:25,145
and such a terrible friend
at the exact same time.

246
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,287
There's not a lot

247
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,556
that I can relate
to in this world.

248
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:40,326
People here are,

249
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:44,497
well, people, generally,

250
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:46,870
and me, not so much.

251
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,138
But I relate to you.

252
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:53,677
I hate being alone.

253
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:57,274
I don't like being left
with my own thoughts,

254
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,750
such as they are.

255
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:02,019
I need friends.

256
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:03,521
One way of making friends

257
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,354
is not murdering
everyone you meet.

258
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:07,690
Yes, you get my dilemma,

259
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,092
but you're like me.

260
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:10,255
Josh said so.

261
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,890
A bad friend and a good
friend at the same time.

262
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,229
How do you do it?
I have no choice.

263
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:20,267
You were friends with Eliot.

264
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,407
Very best friends.

265
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,544
Now you can be friends with me.

266
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:27,475
It'll be the same.

267
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:29,209
You can show me
how to be more like him.

268
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,441
No.

269
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,250
I love Eliot.

270
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,722
I would do anything
for him, even help you,

271
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:37,723
but you and I, we
won't ever be friends.

272
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,126
Unless you let me talk to him.

273
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:43,720
Prove he's still alive in there.

274
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,828
I can't do that.

275
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,795
But you could let him go.

276
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:50,332
You could choose a new body.

277
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:52,395
But I like this one.

278
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:56,333
I like the way
people look at me,

279
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:59,542
and you and your friends

280
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,275
care so deeply about
what happens to it.

281
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:04,575
Why would I ever leave it?

282
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,428
Hi. I'm here to see Bacchus.

283
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:16,987
Um...

284
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:19,089
Yeah, I don't know what
you're talking about. Um...

285
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:20,292
It's Ember's.

286
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:23,063
"Bacchanal" is the
word you're looking for.

287
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:24,330
Cut the crap, Shoshana.

288
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:25,924
It's me, Josh, from
the Bed-Stuy party.

289
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,270
Uh, oh, I...

290
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,605
I didn't think you'd
remember me.

291
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:30,953
Well, it's actually, you know...

292
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,221
It's really good
that you're here,

293
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:34,840
'cause he's been darker
the last few weeks.

294
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,045
I think a friendly
face could really help.

295
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:38,341
Great.

296
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,487
Hey, Q?

297
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,450
Oh, my God.

298
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:46,018
Hey.

299
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:48,003
Where have you been?
We couldn't find you.

300
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,552
"Enrolled at
Brakebills," she said,

301
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:50,961
fully aware of the irony.

302
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,490
I just, um...

303
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,254
I don't know
where to start. Uh...

304
00:13:57,804 --> 00:13:59,204
Have you heard
anything about Alice?

305
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:00,896
No.

306
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,407
No, I mean, not
since she completely

307
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,068
screwed us over
at Blackspire, why?

308
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,805
Where is everyone else?

309
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:09,514
If the Library's going
to arrest us on sight,

310
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:12,575
how do we get one of
these coins, much less five?

311
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:15,787
I asked around, so there
might be another way.

312
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:20,088
The Library's official story
is that the McAllistair family

313
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,650
heroically turned magic back on.

314
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:25,665
So, they gave them a free pass
to as many coins as they want.

315
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,633
They give them
these special cards

316
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,328
with no limits, no
questions asked.

317
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:30,936
Only a few of them
exist, and hedges

318
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,047
are calling them Black Cards.

319
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,095
We could steal one.

320
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:34,216
If you steal a credit card,

321
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,300
it only works until
it's reported stolen.

322
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:37,933
With something this valuable,

323
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,154
that's gonna happen
pretty damn quick.

324
00:14:39,178 --> 00:14:40,202
Forgery, maybe?

325
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,907
Good enough to fool the Library?

326
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:44,307
I used to know a guy,
a master counterfeiter.

327
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,670
The Beast killed him, but...

328
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:47,318
But that was in your timeline.

329
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,814
I did know Frankie
since before Brakebills,

330
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,824
so hopefully your
Penny did, too.

331
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,894
And hopefully he
has the same number.

332
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:59,162
Damn it.

333
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:00,793
I still have the DJ's phone.

334
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:05,180
Well, the good
news is your Penny

335
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,248
has the same password as me,

336
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,366
so, I'm downloading
his contacts right now.

337
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:11,309
Ugh. So many
Insta notifications.

338
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:12,868
Okay, I got his
number. I'll try him.

339
00:15:13,112 --> 00:15:14,136
I can't log in.

340
00:15:14,213 --> 00:15:15,704
It wants to send a text message

341
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:17,808
to my old phone to confirm,

342
00:15:17,884 --> 00:15:18,924
but if I had my old phone,

343
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:20,311
why the hell would
I be doing this?

344
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:23,080
Have you talked
to your dad lately?

345
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,418
I called him from Brian's phone,

346
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:26,925
but nobody picked up.

347
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,553
Nobody answers their phone

348
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:30,305
when they don't recognize
the number, right?

349
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:31,763
You're probably right.

350
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:33,298
Guys, he picked up.

351
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:38,676
Oh, I don't think
you can park there.

352
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:40,300
Yeah, I don't think he cares.

353
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,302
Shit just always seems
to work out for Frankie.

354
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:44,972
Another timeline?

355
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:46,542
That's wild.

356
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,290
- I thought you were dead.
- Likewise.

357
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:49,994
So, the Frankie I knew
was a counterfeiter.

358
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,341
So am I, but for most jobs,

359
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:53,647
my skills are overkill.

360
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:56,382
Duping objects to fool
regular dopes is simple.

361
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:58,857
99% of the art you
see in museums is fake,

362
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,416
because, why
waste the real thing

363
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:02,271
on people who can't tell
the difference anyway?

364
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,695
Fooling magicians, though,

365
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,591
that's where the
special sauce comes in.

366
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,132
So, what's the MacGuffin?

367
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,327
A Library Black Card.

368
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:11,567
That's gonna
take a lot of sauce.

369
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,983
You know what? Let me get that.

370
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:16,202
That's probably for me.

371
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,313
Congratulations! Not now, guys.

372
00:16:26,052 --> 00:16:27,629
You know what?
Actually, I'm gonna grab...

373
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,985
Thank you. Thanks.

374
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:30,079
Have a good one.

375
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,993
Are you gonna
explain that, or...

376
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:39,043
Is it in your size?
They're always my size.

377
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,900
Anyway, uh...
Library Black Card.

378
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:43,545
That's tricky, but I can do it.

379
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,037
Yeah, what'll it cost us?

380
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:47,933
Whatever you're
withdrawing from the Library,

381
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,566
double it.

382
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:51,201
Ten Dewey coins?

383
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,471
That's like "raise an army
of the dead" level magic.

384
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:55,105
That is a big ask. Yeah.

385
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,480
If my forgery works,
it won't matter.

386
00:16:57,884 --> 00:16:59,944
Now, I'm gonna need some stuff.

387
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,318
I'm gonna need at least two
minutes with a real Black Card

388
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,414
to use as a mold, two
Philly cheese steaks,

389
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,152
four liters of cherry soda,

390
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:07,536
not store brand.

391
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,961
That's a deal breaker.
I know, I know.

392
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,189
And at least a third of a
Dewey coin to get us started.

393
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:14,332
You need a battery
to get more batteries?

394
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:16,495
Yeah. Call it, uh, seed magic.

395
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:17,662
Oh, uh...

396
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:18,761
We can't exactly

397
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:20,568
walk into the Library
and just ask for one.

398
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,880
Well, there's a game of
Push happening tonight.

399
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,199
What's Push?

400
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:25,737
It's a card game.

401
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:27,938
High rollers play for Deweys,

402
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:29,505
but you can buy in for less.

403
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,575
Any of you good at cards?

404
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,664
A magic card game is hard
under normal circumstances,

405
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:42,871
but right now the Library's
only putting out enough magic

406
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,989
for small-scale spells.

407
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,363
I mean, one big transformation,

408
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,493
and I'm gonna black
out the entire room.

409
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:50,867
Yeah, it's about efficiency.

410
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:52,803
Some magicians are semi-trucks,

411
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:54,670
guzzling magic to
do a simple spell.

412
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,231
Some of us are Priuses.

413
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:57,333
What are you?

414
00:17:58,144 --> 00:17:59,635
A sensible, mid-sized...

415
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:01,392
What was the one that
would always explode?

416
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:02,676
Yeah, that.

417
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,580
Hey, can we back him up?

418
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:08,450
No, no, not, not me.

419
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:10,016
I can't even make a spark.

420
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,786
Well, I'm persona non grata

421
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:14,724
at Push games
in this city, so...

422
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,020
I just don't want to.

423
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,462
It's a one-on-one game,
anyway, so no backup.

424
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:20,428
But, uh, good luck.

425
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:23,741
What do you have to wager?

426
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:26,401
It's a protection amulet.

427
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,498
It's sort of all-purpose.

428
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:32,972
It's not good enough.

429
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:35,677
If you can't buy in, make
room for somebody who can.

430
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,914
Uh, wait, um, he's a Traveler.

431
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,681
I'll wager his exclusive
services for 48 hours.

432
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:45,054
A year. A month.

433
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,592
Whoa. Hold on. I won't lose.

434
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:47,659
But you're a loser.

435
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:50,287
A month. No questions asked.

436
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:53,857
Welcome to the game.

437
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,077
Okay, the rules
of Push are simple.

438
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,168
It's like the game War.

439
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:07,269
<i>Two players.</i>

440
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:08,678
<i>Each draws a card.</i>

441
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:10,216
<i>High card wins the hand.</i>

442
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,136
<i>When the deck is
gone, the game's over.</i>

443
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,810
But the real art of the game
is knowing how to cheat.

444
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:21,959
<i>See, a shuffled deck of cards</i>

445
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:23,291
<i>is not a fixed thing.</i>

446
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,263
<i>It's a cloud of possibilities.</i>

447
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,800
<i>And you can change
the odds if you know how.</i>

448
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,443
<i>Put the right card
into your hand,</i>

449
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,646
<i>or the wrong card
into your opponent's.</i>

450
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:03,863
Wait, what is that?

451
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:07,904
Rules of poker.

452
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:13,855
<i>You'll have to beat
three opponents</i>

453
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,142
<i>to win the whole thing.</i>

454
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,705
Shall we?

455
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:28,322
<i>The more probability
spells that you throw around,</i>

456
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:31,023
<i>the more improbable
things can get.</i>

457
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:36,866
Be careful of those.

458
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:38,268
They killed Bobby Darin.

459
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:44,971
<i>The final round is when
you play for the Dewey.</i>

460
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:30,183
Breaking a tie is complicated.

461
00:21:30,256 --> 00:21:31,280
Get the hats.

462
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:32,789
<i>You throw cards into a hat,</i>

463
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:35,425
<i>and whichever ones you sink,
you score like a poker hand.</i>

464
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:51,676
Straight flush.

465
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:58,814
I'm just saying,
what if he loses?

466
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:01,450
I'm a Traveler. I'll grab
the coin and blip away.

467
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,714
Yeah, and then the
people you just robbed

468
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,155
hunt you down and torture you.

469
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:07,855
So, why don't we
save that for plan B?

470
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:12,757
Listen, if you lose
this last hand, it's over.

471
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:15,900
I think we need to be
ready for plan B. No.

472
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:35,511
What is the point
of this display?

473
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:44,327
You've used up all the
ambient magic in the room.

474
00:22:51,237 --> 00:22:53,536
I guess we'll just have
to play an honest game.

475
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,027
Got it. Perfect.

476
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,230
Now the easy part.

477
00:23:19,298 --> 00:23:21,233
Borrow a Black Card
to use as a template.

478
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:25,869
Anything? No.

479
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,708
Why are we going
along with this?

480
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,003
Marina killed my mother.

481
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,410
That was a different Marina.

482
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,878
How different?

483
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:38,574
And we're just gonna
hand her a nuclear bomb?

484
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,379
What's the alternative?

485
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:42,111
We use it against her.

486
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:43,886
Where does that end?

487
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:47,056
I came here to get away
from that kind of shit.

488
00:23:47,526 --> 00:23:50,394
You know, I'm getting
really sick of being the voice

489
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:52,727
in the back of the room
that everyone ignores.

490
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:55,559
The other me, Sam,

491
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,861
did whatever she
thought was right,

492
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,497
regardless of what
anybody else thought.

493
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:00,732
I get it.

494
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:05,171
Because where I came from,
everyone I cared about is dead.

495
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,906
No other voice to
listen to but mine.

496
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:12,351
But maybe Sam didn't care
what anyone else thought

497
00:24:12,418 --> 00:24:13,613
because she's alone.

498
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:15,980
You aren't.

499
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,719
Whoa.

500
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,426
I got something here.

501
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,197
There's huge energy
coming off her purse.

502
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,564
It's gotta be the
Black Card in there.

503
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:30,902
Showtime.

504
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,101
Oh, excuse me, I'm...

505
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:38,200
I'm sorry.

506
00:24:38,277 --> 00:24:39,506
Do I know you from somewhere?

507
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:42,213
I mean, I dabbled in acting.

508
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:44,574
What have I seen you in?

509
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,849
Let's just say some
provocative films of the 1970s.

510
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:50,480
Interesting.

511
00:25:07,106 --> 00:25:08,130
All finished.

512
00:25:08,374 --> 00:25:09,706
Great. Let's go.

513
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:11,604
Uh, there is one little thing.

514
00:25:11,877 --> 00:25:14,005
That special sauce I
was talking about before.

515
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:17,210
Most forgers use
complicated illusion work.

516
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:19,251
That's not quite my thing.

517
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:32,189
Did a bird just bring
you a sandwich?

518
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:33,765
Yeah, I guess she did.

519
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:34,899
You want it?

520
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:37,634
Well, I mean, yeah, but...

521
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,331
But what the fuck, Frankie?

522
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:40,682
This is what I'm talking about.

523
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,607
Luck is my discipline.

524
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:45,576
The forgeries I make give whoever's
holding them insanely good luck.

525
00:25:45,644 --> 00:25:48,512
So, nobody even bothers
to check if the thing is fake.

526
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:52,517
I've done the spellwork so many
times, I'm just sort of encrusted with it.

527
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:56,316
Luck is zero-sum, so all that
bad luck has got to go somewhere.

528
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,792
It goes into a bear?

529
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:04,386
Somebody, not
me, has to hold that

530
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,992
while the others bring the
Black Card to the Library.

531
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:10,662
And whoever's holding it
is gonna have a bad day.

532
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:14,098
I'll do it. No, Jules.
You don't have to. He...

533
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:15,173
It's okay.

534
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:20,171
It's hard to explain, but
I'm kind of bulletproof.

535
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:23,547
If anybody should have
terrible luck, it should be me.

536
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:24,749
Why are you bulletproof?

537
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,977
That's none of your business.

538
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:28,677
Pick it up.

539
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:38,524
No, no, no, no, no,
no, something's wrong.

540
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:41,242
Uh, whatever "none of my
business" shit is going on with you,

541
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,895
it's interfering with the
fortune spell, so set it down.

542
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:45,599
Set it down! All right.

543
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:47,605
Ahh...

544
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:51,206
Looks like you just volunteered.

545
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:04,149
You awake?

546
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:05,418
Nope.

547
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:06,651
It's time.

548
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:49,199
Anti-magic paint
on a magic lock.

549
00:27:49,635 --> 00:27:53,128
Wish I had thought of that before those
book-sniffing bastards ruined Christmas.

550
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:00,277
Which way now?

551
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,779
I don't know.
Something isn't right.

552
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:03,281
This should continue straight.

553
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:08,284
Well, you made this map by
mind-controlling a cockroach.

554
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,653
Shouldn't we trust our eyes
rather than some shit-eating bug?

555
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,657
No, I think it's an illusion.

556
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:17,355
There's spellwork on this wall.

557
00:28:30,576 --> 00:28:31,669
Or it's a wall.

558
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:48,219
This is it.

559
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,520
The Books of Everyone.

560
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:51,723
You look for yours, and
I'll go look for my friends'.

561
00:28:53,765 --> 00:28:54,805
I gotta tell you,

562
00:28:54,866 --> 00:28:58,166
it is such a relief to take
off that Ember disguise.

563
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,035
So, what have I been
missing down on Earth?

564
00:29:00,105 --> 00:29:03,507
It must be bad. Your
chakras are all fucked up.

565
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:04,870
Oh! Yeah.

566
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:08,672
Uh, we got magic
turned back on. Hey!

567
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:12,049
And, you know, one of
our friends just betrayed us.

568
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:15,511
Which is crazy, right?

569
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,147
Like, who would do that?

570
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:19,748
Yeah. I got mind wiped.

571
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:24,195
Yeah, I was living as this other
dude named Isaac for months.

572
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:29,094
Um, that is exactly kind
of close to my situation.

573
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:33,738
So, I'm being hunted by
this douchebag Monster,

574
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:35,967
and, like, I need a
place to crash, right?

575
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:37,301
That's when I remember,

576
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:39,709
that squirrelly little
human friend of yours

577
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,940
said that he killed Ember,

578
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:44,539
and I'm like, "I could
take that guy's place."

579
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,718
Live to fuck another
day, you know?

580
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,515
It's kind of nice, you know?

581
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:52,683
Freeing to live as
someone else for a little bit.

582
00:29:52,758 --> 00:29:54,226
Yeah, I guess.

583
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:57,627
You know, a famous
cocksman once told me,

584
00:29:58,497 --> 00:30:02,491
"Once you've had quantity,
the only thing left is strange."

585
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,696
And, boy, is this
place full of strange.

586
00:30:07,272 --> 00:30:09,741
I mean, Isaac's life was great.

587
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:13,745
Lot of friends, big family.

588
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:18,112
But eventually, it all ends,

589
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:19,674
and your old life,

590
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:22,151
your old problems,

591
00:30:23,055 --> 00:30:24,250
they catch up to you.

592
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:25,382
Or your problems

593
00:30:25,457 --> 00:30:27,790
never find you and the
party goes on forever.

594
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:30,727
Oh! Look at that, I'm dry.

595
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,963
Is that... Did you make for me?

596
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:36,164
Yes. Josh special?

597
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:38,666
Uh, yes, I made it for you.

598
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,600
You and me, Joshy,

599
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,699
we're the same.

600
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:45,167
We're born to be
the perfect hosts.

601
00:30:45,377 --> 00:30:49,906
We want everyone around us to
have a good time, we make sure of it.

602
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:52,014
Nobody does the same for us.

603
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:53,478
Mmm-mmm.

604
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:56,112
This is to Josh, not to Isaac.

605
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:57,486
This is to the real you.

606
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:04,257
I'm sorry.

607
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:07,128
I pee-peed in it,

608
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:09,327
and you don't...
You don't drink that.

609
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:10,401
So...

610
00:31:12,838 --> 00:31:15,899
This is the dumbest plan.

611
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:18,373
Frankie says the
disguises won't matter.

612
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:21,173
If the Black Card works,
nobody will question them.

613
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,271
I feel like an idiot.

614
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:24,976
Excuse me, sir.

615
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,882
You have a fresh look.

616
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,679
Have you considered modeling?

617
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:34,159
Okay, it's just soup.

618
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:38,455
Can't choke, it's not
scalding. It's totally safe.

619
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:45,832
Ugh! Look at that line.
This is gonna take forever.

620
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,395
I've been thinking,
while we're here,

621
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:48,768
we should get a bit extra.

622
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:52,376
Five for Marina, five
for Frankie, 10 for us.

623
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:55,511
We'd have to be insanely
lucky to get that much.

624
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,811
The more luck we get,

625
00:31:57,883 --> 00:31:59,317
the more bad luck Quentin gets.

626
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:02,512
When this is over, the
McAllistairs will still be after us.

627
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:07,325
We'll need to do some
major cloaking spell.

628
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:08,955
It could kill him.

629
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:12,856
Hey! There's a truck outside
giving out free ice cream!

630
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,897
I mean, two extra
coins can't hurt.

631
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,283
It's all good. Soup
spills all the time.

632
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:24,242
Thanks.

633
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:25,976
Damn it.

634
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:28,844
How the hell do you get a
paper cut from a paper towel?

635
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:31,246
Welcome. Hi.

636
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:34,512
So, how can I help you today?

637
00:32:35,587 --> 00:32:37,886
We need 12
contained current coins.

638
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,485
Here. No, God.

639
00:32:43,562 --> 00:32:44,586
Keep it away.

640
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,463
Everything looks in order.

641
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,728
Just need to check
one little thing.

642
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:01,807
Oh, shoot.

643
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,179
Did you hear something?

644
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,222
Where did it come from?

645
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:13,656
Out of the toilet.

646
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:15,556
All right, then, I'll
send this requisition

647
00:33:15,627 --> 00:33:17,858
to the home office, and
they'll return your coins.

648
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,265
I thought you said your
phone wasn't working.

649
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:37,805
It's a voicemail from my mom.

650
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:39,248
Do you think...

651
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:40,317
Q?

652
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,196
It's got to be about
my dad. I'm not gonna...

653
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,313
No, Q, the bear.

654
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:49,126
Okay.

655
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:54,992
Oh.

656
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:59,134
Your request has been flagged
for follow-up with a supervisor.

657
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:00,399
Wait here, please.

658
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:07,191
A requisition follow-up for you.

659
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:08,792
Christ, can it wait?

660
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:10,807
Fine.

661
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:28,328
Sorry, I can't see for shit.

662
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,831
Bloody thing's making
me crazy. Do you mind?

663
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,838
No, do your thing.

664
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:42,046
What do I do? Just,
please, don't listen to it

665
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:43,775
until we hear back
from Penny and Kady.

666
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:46,341
Oh, shit!

667
00:34:47,953 --> 00:34:50,047
Oh, Jesus Christ, now
I've got it in backwards.

668
00:34:53,658 --> 00:34:55,092
About those coins...

669
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,523
Listen,

670
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:59,121
the truth is, the red
tape, the paperwork,

671
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:01,325
it's, in my mind,
all just a wank.

672
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:02,898
You guys gonna
blow yourselves up?

673
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:04,134
No. No?

674
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:05,627
Great.

675
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:09,004
Request approved.

676
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:16,080
Sorry about the inconvenience.

677
00:35:16,915 --> 00:35:18,679
Thank you very much.
You have a good day.

678
00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:23,319
Jesus, shit!

679
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:25,754
Okay, they did
it. Drop the bear!

680
00:35:29,094 --> 00:35:30,926
It really came out of the...

681
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:32,594
I don't want to talk about it.

682
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:37,167
Thank you, brother.

683
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:41,037
I had a feeling things would
work out, because they always do.

684
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:43,407
By the way, I'd
destroy those ASAP.

685
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:46,445
They'll be out of juice soon, but
you don't want to take any chances.

686
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:47,935
I'm on it.

687
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:04,292
You nutsacked out, didn't you?

688
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:08,466
Oh, well, "pussied out"
makes perfect sense here?

689
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,565
Well, if you mean that I
couldn't go through with it,

690
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:13,264
then, yes, you're right.

691
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:17,002
Josh, we don't
have a choice here.

692
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,971
Now, where is the
rest of the ambrosia?

693
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,204
Fine.

694
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:25,359
But just know that Bacchus will
never drink anything you give him.

695
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:27,215
Oh, I'm not gonna
give it to Bacchus.

696
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:28,919
Yeah, I'm gonna
dump it in there.

697
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:30,754
Everyone will drink it.

698
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:33,291
Are you nuts? There
are over 100 people here.

699
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:35,122
You have no idea
what that will do to them.

700
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:37,355
Well, I'm pretty sure
it'll fucking kill them.

701
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:42,458
And I'll do it, unless you
start acting like a real pussy

702
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:45,671
and take one for
the fucking team.

703
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:51,001
Hey, uh, I'm sorry about...

704
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:54,303
We've all peed in
things we regret.

705
00:36:56,414 --> 00:37:00,977
I know gods are supposed
to be distant and unknowable,

706
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,645
but you're a good guy.

707
00:37:05,857 --> 00:37:07,325
I wanna tell you a secret.

708
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:15,190
What did you put in this?

709
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:21,544
I found my book. Now
let's get the hell out of here.

710
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:23,336
I can't find my friends' books.

711
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,755
"The following books have been
removed from circulation for revisions.

712
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:29,247
"Q. Coldwater, A. Quinn."

713
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,748
They're filling in the
endings of our books...

714
00:37:33,118 --> 00:37:35,478
The pages that were missing
because of the Great Blank Spot.

715
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:45,195
Nick?

716
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:51,193
Hey, I'm sorry about your friends'
books, but this is our chance.

717
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,295
Come with me. I can't.

718
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:55,239
I can't leave
without their books.

719
00:37:55,974 --> 00:37:57,374
Well, I want to do the...

720
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,638
Look, just go while you
still have the chance, okay?

721
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:01,780
I can find the Revision
Room on my own.

722
00:38:03,748 --> 00:38:07,617
For what it's worth,
you're still on my Nice List.

723
00:38:27,605 --> 00:38:29,005
The fuck?

724
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:47,722
Do you remember me?

725
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:50,688
Because I don't.

726
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:53,854
I don't remember my name

727
00:38:53,932 --> 00:38:55,491
or where I came from.

728
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:58,633
But I remember you.

729
00:38:59,704 --> 00:39:03,368
You took something from
me, something important,

730
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:06,104
and then you threw me

731
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,177
in a cage,

732
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:09,574
and I would like

733
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:11,309
for you to explain.

734
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:14,075
You remember all that,

735
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:18,385
but you don't remember
what you are, what you did.

736
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,082
The word "monster"

737
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:21,158
has been thrown around.

738
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:22,760
That's right.

739
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:25,262
We put you with
the rest of your kind.

740
00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:28,122
And I ate them.

741
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,725
You're kind of making
my case for me here.

742
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,962
We have the same parents.

743
00:39:33,404 --> 00:39:34,565
Why am I a monster

744
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:35,639
and you're a god?

745
00:39:35,807 --> 00:39:38,743
If you don't want to be a
monster, then let me go.

746
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,477
Give me back what you took

747
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:41,808
from me, and maybe I will.

748
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:46,207
I can't ever.

749
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:48,080
I'm sorry.

750
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:54,253
It was a part of me,
and now it's a part of you,

751
00:39:56,961 --> 00:40:00,193
burning in your body.

752
00:40:01,032 --> 00:40:02,591
Wait. Wait.

753
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:04,699
This world needs me.

754
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,697
Its god is dead.

755
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,566
You don't have to do this.

756
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,032
There's others.
There's still time.

757
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,733
We can figure something out.

758
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,443
It doesn't have to be me.

759
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:15,603
It doesn't have to...

760
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:39,128
What the fuck did
he just rip out of him?

761
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:41,333
Whatever it is, to a fairy eye,

762
00:40:41,406 --> 00:40:43,705
it's like staring
straight at the sun.

763
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:48,812
They're real.

764
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:52,083
Well, it's been a pleasure.

765
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:54,914
The trackers on us?

766
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:57,179
Not actually a thing.

767
00:40:57,255 --> 00:40:59,383
You guys are too
lawful good to bitch out.

768
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,132
Marina.

769
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:12,134
I've been looking for you.

770
00:41:17,342 --> 00:41:19,902
Excuse me, miss. These
are free to a good home.

771
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:21,071
Are you interested?

772
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:30,112
Hey, are you sure Marina's apartment's
the safest place for us to meet?

773
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:31,953
It's not Marina's.

774
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:34,016
It's mine.

775
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:35,216
What did you do?

776
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:36,758
I handled the problem.

777
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:39,294
Now, can we do
this cloaking spell

778
00:41:39,364 --> 00:41:41,458
before the McAllistairs
show up and kill all of us?

779
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:47,104
Hey.

780
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,000
You haven't listened?

781
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:51,875
You know, your bad luck's gone.

782
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:54,645
Safe as it'll ever be.

783
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:59,650
But that's not what's
really stopping you.

784
00:42:00,218 --> 00:42:01,311
The other me,

785
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,620
Brian...

786
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:07,016
His dad died when he was a kid.

787
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:10,560
He was too little
to even understand.

788
00:42:11,496 --> 00:42:13,624
All of his problems
were like that.

789
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:15,132
No sharp edges.

790
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,199
Yeah.

791
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:18,902
Look at us.

792
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:22,367
We paid a hell
of a fucking price.

793
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:26,301
You gave up being a goddess.

794
00:42:28,846 --> 00:42:30,542
I gave up my father.

795
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:37,588
What did we get in return?

796
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:39,850
Magic is back.

797
00:42:44,829 --> 00:42:46,798
Mmm-mmm. Not in
the way that we wanted.

798
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:52,760
How are you not furious?

799
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:58,003
Because, for almost everyone,

800
00:42:58,076 --> 00:43:01,046
the world is a little brighter.

801
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:03,604
Even if they never know why.

802
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:07,052
I hate the Library
for what they did.

803
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:11,811
But my part in it...
I knew what it cost.

804
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:15,959
And I'd do it again.

805
00:43:20,631 --> 00:43:22,065
But you wouldn't.

806
00:43:25,236 --> 00:43:27,762
Will you sit here for a minute?

807
00:43:28,306 --> 00:43:29,306
Yeah.

808
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:34,311
<i>Hi, Quentin.</i>

809
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:38,377
<i>Sorry to leave a
message with bad news.</i>

810
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:42,481
<i>I need to talk to you
about your father.</i>
