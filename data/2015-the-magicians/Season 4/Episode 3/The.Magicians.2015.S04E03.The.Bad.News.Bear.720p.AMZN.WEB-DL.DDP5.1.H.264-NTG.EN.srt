1
00:00:06,484 --> 00:00:08,530
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:08,573 --> 00:00:09,661
Are you Santa Claus?

3
00:00:09,705 --> 00:00:11,228
Oh, I'm not... not that.

4
00:00:11,272 --> 00:00:12,360
Magic's gone.

5
00:00:12,403 --> 00:00:13,665
I'm not a magician,

6
00:00:13,709 --> 00:00:15,276
but I could feel it
when it was gone,

7
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:17,191
and I knew it wasn't
a coincidence

8
00:00:17,234 --> 00:00:19,193
when I went into remission
a week later.

9
00:00:19,236 --> 00:00:20,629
What timeline are you from?

10
00:00:20,672 --> 00:00:22,065
The one where you
owe me child support.

11
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:23,371
I'm kidding.

12
00:00:23,414 --> 00:00:24,850
Kay, then if you want me to help

13
00:00:24,894 --> 00:00:26,504
these students, can
you tell me who they are?

14
00:00:26,548 --> 00:00:28,680
Their lives were
in grave danger.

15
00:00:28,724 --> 00:00:30,378
I cast a spell that

16
00:00:30,421 --> 00:00:32,380
erased their identities
and gave them new ones.

17
00:00:32,423 --> 00:00:33,816
I mean, isn't there anything
you can do?

18
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:36,079
If I reveal that the spell
can be reversed,

19
00:00:36,123 --> 00:00:37,559
then someone would reverse
the spell.

20
00:00:43,652 --> 00:00:45,219
Bacchus,
what are you doing here?

21
00:00:45,262 --> 00:00:46,872
Why do you want everyone
thinking you're Ember?

22
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:48,222
Thanks for popping in.

23
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:50,746
Oh, my God.

24
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:52,356
Mis hermanos.

25
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,879
Where were you?
We... we looked everywhere...

26
00:00:53,923 --> 00:00:55,707
- Stay back.
- Why?

27
00:00:55,751 --> 00:00:57,666
Because I'm not here to play.

28
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,583
Marina.

29
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,803
Why do you look like
you're fleeing something?

30
00:01:04,847 --> 00:01:07,850
It's me, Margo,
previously known as Janet.

31
00:01:07,893 --> 00:01:10,113
Look, I'm gonna do you a solid.

32
00:01:10,157 --> 00:01:12,289
Don't go up there.
Why?

33
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,639
Because there's an uninvited
guest in my apartment

34
00:01:14,683 --> 00:01:16,815
who's probably killing
your friends right about now.

35
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:19,340
Look, I don't know what he is,
and I'm assuming it's a "he"

36
00:01:19,383 --> 00:01:22,343
because this is some
toxically masculine behavior,

37
00:01:22,386 --> 00:01:25,476
but he walked through
every ward and shield I had,

38
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,174
set off every alarm.

39
00:01:27,217 --> 00:01:28,871
So instead of going inside,

40
00:01:28,914 --> 00:01:30,394
I'm gonna get
a breakfast burrito.

41
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:31,439
You wanna join?

42
00:01:31,482 --> 00:01:33,136
We have to help them.

43
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,443
Oh, you're one of those.

44
00:01:35,486 --> 00:01:37,619
Fine, you wanna
stick your neck out?

45
00:01:37,662 --> 00:01:39,534
There's something inside
that can help you.

46
00:01:39,577 --> 00:01:41,188
Do tell.

47
00:01:43,407 --> 00:01:44,930
No traveling.

48
00:01:44,974 --> 00:01:46,454
Where to start?

49
00:01:46,497 --> 00:01:48,717
Order is important
with these things.

50
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,720
Who goes first?
Who goes last?

51
00:01:51,763 --> 00:01:53,896
Oh, you keep looking at him...

52
00:01:54,766 --> 00:01:56,899
Because you don't
want him to die?

53
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,858
Which means
he has to go before you.

54
00:02:01,991 --> 00:02:04,776
You care about all of them.

55
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,821
So you're last.

56
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:11,609
Thank Christ.

57
00:02:11,653 --> 00:02:12,871
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

58
00:02:12,915 --> 00:02:15,309
Not... Eliot.

59
00:02:15,352 --> 00:02:17,659
This thing has god-level power,

60
00:02:17,702 --> 00:02:20,314
and I have a bad history
with gods,

61
00:02:20,357 --> 00:02:22,446
since apparently one killed me.

62
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:23,839
No, it's fine.

63
00:02:23,882 --> 00:02:24,883
Different me, but I didn't want

64
00:02:24,927 --> 00:02:26,320
to get caught off guard again,

65
00:02:26,363 --> 00:02:28,844
so I called in every favor I had

66
00:02:28,887 --> 00:02:30,802
to build a defense system.

67
00:02:30,846 --> 00:02:33,544
All you have to do is get him
to sit in the gold chair.

68
00:02:33,588 --> 00:02:34,676
Why the gold chair?

69
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:36,330
Because it had to be something,

70
00:02:36,373 --> 00:02:37,983
and everybody wants to sit
in the gold chair.

71
00:02:38,027 --> 00:02:39,202
It's total power move.

72
00:02:40,943 --> 00:02:42,423
I'm so glad you came.

73
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:44,860
Saves me
having to hunt you down.

74
00:02:44,903 --> 00:02:48,211
I've got so much of that
ahead of me already.

75
00:02:48,255 --> 00:02:49,821
What is he talking about?

76
00:02:49,865 --> 00:02:52,781
He's, uh, hunting gods.

77
00:02:52,824 --> 00:02:56,393
It's vengeance
for locking you in the castle.

78
00:02:56,437 --> 00:02:58,265
They did more than that,

79
00:02:58,308 --> 00:03:00,528
and so did you.

80
00:03:00,571 --> 00:03:02,530
You tried to kill me.

81
00:03:06,925 --> 00:03:09,624
You were all part of it.

82
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,890
Then what?

83
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:16,631
There's a bell on the table.

84
00:03:16,674 --> 00:03:17,762
Ring it.

85
00:03:19,851 --> 00:03:21,462
And he explodes?

86
00:03:21,505 --> 00:03:23,246
He gets a face full
of distilled ambrosia.

87
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,987
It's basically meth for gods.

88
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,858
Its gets them high, but an overdose

89
00:03:26,902 --> 00:03:28,033
will knock them on their asses.

90
00:03:31,036 --> 00:03:33,561
Tell me Eliot
is still in there somewhere.

91
00:03:33,604 --> 00:03:35,563
Not that I've seen.

92
00:03:35,606 --> 00:03:37,739
Your round, innocent face

93
00:03:37,782 --> 00:03:40,698
will make your death
particularly upsetting,

94
00:03:40,742 --> 00:03:42,396
so I've decided
to start with you.

95
00:03:45,703 --> 00:03:47,401
I can give you Bacchus.

96
00:03:50,534 --> 00:03:52,710
You're hunting gods,

97
00:03:52,754 --> 00:03:55,757
and I found him hiding
someplace far away.

98
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:58,977
Hiding from you, right?

99
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,590
I can take you there...

100
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:04,287
if you let them live.

101
00:04:05,897 --> 00:04:07,421
All of them.

102
00:04:12,643 --> 00:04:15,385
Perhaps we can be friends
after all.

103
00:04:30,705 --> 00:04:32,576
So where is everyone else?

104
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,796
I don't know.

105
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,798
They were supposed
to remain hidden.

106
00:04:38,974 --> 00:04:40,932
I meant to protect you.

107
00:04:42,717 --> 00:04:45,720
Doesn't really seem
like I need protection.

108
00:04:45,763 --> 00:04:47,591
I mean, nothing
your spell threw at me

109
00:04:47,635 --> 00:04:49,027
even left a scratch.

110
00:04:49,071 --> 00:04:51,552
Reynard did say,
even without their powers,

111
00:04:51,595 --> 00:04:52,901
gods are hard to kill.

112
00:04:54,424 --> 00:04:58,559
I wouldn't underestimate
the will of Irene McAllister.

113
00:04:58,602 --> 00:05:00,822
Huh.

114
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:02,867
Tell a few people
that you're leaving forever,

115
00:05:02,911 --> 00:05:06,393
and look what
the ungrateful bastards do.

116
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:09,004
Nice.

117
00:05:09,047 --> 00:05:10,745
You know, if the deal is broken

118
00:05:10,788 --> 00:05:11,876
and the McAllisters are coming,

119
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,965
I'm gonna have to warn everyone.

120
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:17,882
Contacting your friends will
put a target on their backs.

121
00:05:17,926 --> 00:05:19,667
To be clear,

122
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,452
you put the target on our backs.

123
00:05:22,496 --> 00:05:24,541
You betrayed us.

124
00:05:24,585 --> 00:05:26,108
Hmm.

125
00:05:26,151 --> 00:05:29,111
I sacrificed everything
to bring back magic.

126
00:05:29,154 --> 00:05:32,027
You know what I sacrificed,

127
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,158
and look what you do with it.

128
00:05:34,638 --> 00:05:38,773
Yes, Ms. Wicker,

129
00:05:38,816 --> 00:05:43,734
I made a deal
with the goddamn Library,

130
00:05:43,778 --> 00:05:47,085
and in doing so,
I saved your lives.

131
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:49,131
Yeah, well, you're pretty
fucking quick to compromise,

132
00:05:49,174 --> 00:05:50,524
you know that?

133
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:55,050
Now, I need to find my friends,
but I can't do magic,

134
00:05:55,093 --> 00:05:57,922
so you're going to cast
the locator spell for me.

135
00:06:19,117 --> 00:06:20,945
Dean Fogg. Finally.

136
00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:22,730
I only have a moment.

137
00:06:24,645 --> 00:06:25,994
You know how the Library

138
00:06:26,037 --> 00:06:29,563
contains the books of everyone
who ever lived?

139
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:30,738
Yeah.

140
00:06:30,781 --> 00:06:33,654
The Great Blank Spot is over.

141
00:06:33,697 --> 00:06:35,917
The Library can update
their books again.

142
00:06:37,614 --> 00:06:41,444
So, if your friends were to get
their memories back,

143
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:42,706
the Library would know.

144
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,752
They'd try to find them

145
00:06:44,795 --> 00:06:47,058
to keep them safe

146
00:06:47,102 --> 00:06:50,758
from the monster
that you warned us about.

147
00:06:51,802 --> 00:06:53,804
You're telling me they have
books that describe

148
00:06:53,848 --> 00:06:57,504
every damn thing everyone does
or ever will do,

149
00:06:57,547 --> 00:06:59,506
when you're sleeping,
when you're awake,

150
00:06:59,549 --> 00:07:01,072
naughty or nice?

151
00:07:01,116 --> 00:07:03,205
You know how much time
that would have saved me?

152
00:07:03,248 --> 00:07:05,599
Can we please not
with the Santa stuff right now?

153
00:07:05,642 --> 00:07:08,079
Well, could you please not
with the angsty, nerdy stuff?

154
00:07:08,123 --> 00:07:10,168
Huh?
No, 'cause that's who you are,

155
00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:11,822
and I don't judge you for it.

156
00:07:11,866 --> 00:07:13,781
Dean Fogg was trying
to give me a message.

157
00:07:13,824 --> 00:07:16,653
Look, if we escape,
they'll just read our books,

158
00:07:16,697 --> 00:07:18,263
find out where we are,
and come after us.

159
00:07:18,307 --> 00:07:20,657
So we just take the books
with us,

160
00:07:20,701 --> 00:07:23,007
or, uh... or destroy 'em.

161
00:07:23,051 --> 00:07:25,096
But first we have
to actually escape.

162
00:07:27,185 --> 00:07:28,839
I can get us to the fireplace.

163
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:31,668
Just be ready.

164
00:07:33,017 --> 00:07:35,280
All I'm offering is a location.

165
00:07:35,324 --> 00:07:36,630
The rest is on you.

166
00:07:36,673 --> 00:07:38,806
Knowing where Bacchus is

167
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:40,590
doesn't help me if he runs away,

168
00:07:40,634 --> 00:07:43,027
which he'll do
the second I show up.

169
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:44,681
You see my problem,

170
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:47,771
and how maybe it is just
easier to kill you all.

171
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:56,693
Do you know what this is?

172
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,095
Where did you get that?

173
00:08:07,138 --> 00:08:09,532
I didn't,

174
00:08:09,576 --> 00:08:11,882
but I know that enough of it
will mess up a god long enough

175
00:08:11,926 --> 00:08:13,884
for you to do
whatever you need to do.

176
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:15,059
Excuse me, Margo?

177
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,018
Quick talk?

178
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:25,026
Could you stop volunteering?

179
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:27,071
I know Bacchus.
He's a friend.

180
00:08:27,115 --> 00:08:29,030
Great.

181
00:08:29,073 --> 00:08:31,032
Then you'll poison him.

182
00:08:31,075 --> 00:08:32,947
He'll never suspect a friend.

183
00:08:37,778 --> 00:08:39,562
I could always kill you.

184
00:08:39,606 --> 00:08:40,955
Awesome.

185
00:08:40,998 --> 00:08:42,217
Great choices.

186
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:44,219
Well, let's get going, then.

187
00:08:44,262 --> 00:08:46,613
Guys, in case it even
needs to be said,

188
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:47,701
I know Marina.

189
00:08:47,744 --> 00:08:49,050
She is not a helpful person.

190
00:08:49,093 --> 00:08:51,008
So just act accordingly.

191
00:08:56,144 --> 00:08:57,928
Of course I'm getting paid.

192
00:08:57,972 --> 00:08:59,800
The McAllisters
have a bounty on your heads,

193
00:08:59,843 --> 00:09:01,018
dead or alive.

194
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:02,585
The real yous,

195
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:04,065
not the witness-protection
identities.

196
00:09:04,108 --> 00:09:05,762
So you can see how
it'd be profitable for me

197
00:09:05,806 --> 00:09:07,155
to get you back to normal.

198
00:09:07,198 --> 00:09:08,330
What are they offering?

199
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:12,290
- Three Deweys.
- What the hell's a Dewey?

200
00:09:12,334 --> 00:09:13,901
As in Melvil Dewey,

201
00:09:13,944 --> 00:09:15,598
the most famous librarian
of all time.

202
00:09:15,642 --> 00:09:17,034
He has his own decimal system.

203
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:18,296
Well, I think
you're being generous

204
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,689
with the word "famous."

205
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:24,694
Okay, so in the new world order,

206
00:09:24,738 --> 00:09:26,217
there's just enough
magic in the air

207
00:09:26,261 --> 00:09:28,698
to keep the boring masses
fat and happy,

208
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:30,744
but you got an itch
to do something bigger,

209
00:09:30,787 --> 00:09:33,137
you have to file a request
with the Library.

210
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:35,139
They decide if you're
trustworthy, and they give you

211
00:09:35,183 --> 00:09:37,054
a cute little battery
in the shape of a coin.

212
00:09:37,098 --> 00:09:39,317
They put the faces of famous
librarians on there,

213
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:41,929
but Dewey's the only one
people can remember.

214
00:09:41,972 --> 00:09:45,976
Well, and Laura Bush,
but Bushes just never stuck.

215
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,978
All right, well,
we'll pay the bounty ourselves.

216
00:09:48,936 --> 00:09:50,154
How are you gonna get Dewey's?

217
00:09:50,198 --> 00:09:51,678
I don't know.
We'll figure it out.

218
00:09:51,721 --> 00:09:53,157
We always...
Sometimes.

219
00:09:53,201 --> 00:09:55,725
Most of the time we do.

220
00:09:59,163 --> 00:10:01,949
Five Deweys
to make it worth the delay,

221
00:10:01,992 --> 00:10:04,081
and know that I have trackers
on all of you,

222
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:07,345
so if you try to run,
it won't go your way.

223
00:10:12,829 --> 00:10:14,178
Don't drink all my beer.

224
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:25,146
Seems like this is the place.

225
00:10:25,189 --> 00:10:26,495
It is.

226
00:10:26,538 --> 00:10:29,280
Those are maenads,
Bacchus followers.

227
00:10:29,324 --> 00:10:30,586
Get to it, then.

228
00:10:32,066 --> 00:10:36,331
Oh, and if they have pizza,
bring me some.

229
00:10:41,597 --> 00:10:43,251
We can still find a way out.

230
00:10:43,294 --> 00:10:44,426
We already did.
This is it.

231
00:10:44,469 --> 00:10:46,167
We're doing it right now.

232
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,647
You had a weapon that
could have stopped him,

233
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,561
and instead of using it,
you gave it to him.

234
00:10:49,605 --> 00:10:50,693
We tried that already

235
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:52,347
with Julia's god-killing bullet.

236
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,696
All it did was kill
the monster's host,

237
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,219
which in this case is Eliot.

238
00:10:55,263 --> 00:10:57,700
Who, for all we know, is dead.

239
00:11:00,485 --> 00:11:02,270
Or he's trapped in there,

240
00:11:02,313 --> 00:11:04,054
forced to watch everything
the monster does,

241
00:11:04,098 --> 00:11:06,361
just waiting for us
to find a way to help him.

242
00:11:08,624 --> 00:11:10,757
What are you gonna
slip the ambrosia into?

243
00:11:12,802 --> 00:11:16,371
I guess I'll make a Fillorian
version of his favorite drink.

244
00:11:16,414 --> 00:11:19,243
Margarita, but instead of
salt on the rim, it will be...

245
00:11:19,287 --> 00:11:21,115
God meth. Perfect.

246
00:11:21,158 --> 00:11:24,379
Now go poison his ass so we can
get out of this malarial swamp.

247
00:11:24,422 --> 00:11:25,685
You know what's incredible?

248
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:27,425
How you can be
such a good friend

249
00:11:27,469 --> 00:11:29,471
and such a terrible friend
at the exact same time.

250
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,349
There's not a lot

251
00:11:38,393 --> 00:11:41,091
that I can relate to
in this world.

252
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,747
People here are...

253
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:48,751
well, people, generally,

254
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:51,580
and me, not so much.

255
00:11:51,623 --> 00:11:53,408
But I relate to you.

256
00:11:56,193 --> 00:11:57,847
I hate being alone.

257
00:11:57,891 --> 00:12:01,068
I don't like being left
with my own thoughts,

258
00:12:01,111 --> 00:12:02,765
such as they are.

259
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:06,290
I need friends.

260
00:12:06,334 --> 00:12:07,596
One way of making friends

261
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:09,598
is not murdering
everyone you meet.

262
00:12:09,641 --> 00:12:11,818
Yes, you get my dilemma,

263
00:12:11,861 --> 00:12:12,862
but you're like me.

264
00:12:12,906 --> 00:12:14,603
Josh said so.

265
00:12:14,646 --> 00:12:17,258
A bad friend and a good friend
at the same time.

266
00:12:17,301 --> 00:12:18,259
How do you do it?

267
00:12:18,302 --> 00:12:19,651
I have no choice.

268
00:12:20,914 --> 00:12:24,700
You were friends with Eliot.

269
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:28,225
Very best friends.

270
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:29,792
Now you can be friends with me.

271
00:12:29,836 --> 00:12:31,446
It'll be the same.

272
00:12:31,489 --> 00:12:33,491
You can show me
how to be more like him.

273
00:12:33,535 --> 00:12:35,798
No.

274
00:12:35,842 --> 00:12:37,626
I love Eliot.

275
00:12:37,669 --> 00:12:39,759
I would do anything for him,
even help you,

276
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:42,152
but you and I,
we won't ever be friends...

277
00:12:43,675 --> 00:12:46,200
Unless you let me talk to him.

278
00:12:46,243 --> 00:12:48,550
Prove he's still alive in there.

279
00:12:48,593 --> 00:12:50,204
I can't do that.

280
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:52,597
But you could let him go.

281
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:55,426
You could choose a new body.

282
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:56,776
But I like this one.

283
00:12:58,429 --> 00:13:01,128
I like the way
people look at me,

284
00:13:01,171 --> 00:13:03,739
and you and your friends

285
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,524
care so deeply
about what happens to it.

286
00:13:06,568 --> 00:13:08,918
Why would I ever leave it?

287
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:18,536
Hi.

288
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,234
I'm here to see Bacchus.

289
00:13:20,277 --> 00:13:22,540
Um, yeah... I don't know
what you're talking about.

290
00:13:22,584 --> 00:13:24,542
Um, it's... it's Ember, s...

291
00:13:24,586 --> 00:13:27,328
"Bacchanal" is the word
you're looking for.

292
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:28,677
Cut the crap, Shoshana.

293
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,852
It's me, Josh,
from the Bedsty party.

294
00:13:29,896 --> 00:13:31,593
Come on.
Oh, I-

295
00:13:31,636 --> 00:13:32,681
I didn't think
you'd remember me.

296
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:34,857
Well, it's actually... you know,

297
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:36,424
it's really good
that you're here,

298
00:13:36,467 --> 00:13:39,514
'cause he's been darker
the last few weeks.

299
00:13:39,557 --> 00:13:41,342
I think a friendly face
could really help.

300
00:13:41,385 --> 00:13:42,734
Great.

301
00:13:45,563 --> 00:13:46,695
Hey, Q?

302
00:13:46,738 --> 00:13:48,653
- Oh, my...
- Oh, my God.

303
00:13:48,697 --> 00:13:50,612
Hey.

304
00:13:50,655 --> 00:13:52,266
Where have you been?
We couldn't find you.

305
00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:53,658
"Enrolled at Brakebills,"
she said,

306
00:13:53,702 --> 00:13:55,269
fully aware of the irony.

307
00:13:55,312 --> 00:13:57,532
I just, um...

308
00:13:58,925 --> 00:14:00,578
I don't know where to start.
Uh...

309
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:03,451
Have you heard
anything about Alice?

310
00:14:03,494 --> 00:14:04,887
No.

311
00:14:04,931 --> 00:14:06,628
No, I mean, not since
she completely

312
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:08,369
screwed us over
at Blackspire, why?

313
00:14:08,412 --> 00:14:09,849
Where is everyone else?

314
00:14:11,024 --> 00:14:13,722
If the Library's
going to arrest us on sight,

315
00:14:13,765 --> 00:14:16,812
how do we get one of these
coins, much less five?

316
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,946
I asked around,
so there might be another way.

317
00:14:19,989 --> 00:14:23,906
The Library's official story
is that the McAllister family

318
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,865
heroically turned magic back on.

319
00:14:25,908 --> 00:14:29,869
So they gave them a free pass
to as many coins as they want.

320
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:31,783
They give them
these special cards

321
00:14:31,827 --> 00:14:33,568
with no limits,
no questions asked.

322
00:14:33,611 --> 00:14:34,743
Only a few of them exist,
and Hedges

323
00:14:34,786 --> 00:14:35,744
are calling them Black Cards.

324
00:14:35,787 --> 00:14:36,876
We could steal one.

325
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,529
If you steal a credit card,

326
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:40,575
it only works until
it's reported stolen.

327
00:14:40,618 --> 00:14:41,750
With something this valuable,

328
00:14:41,793 --> 00:14:43,404
it's gonna happen
pretty damn quick.

329
00:14:43,447 --> 00:14:44,666
Forgery, maybe?

330
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:46,233
Good enough to fool the Library?

331
00:14:46,276 --> 00:14:48,539
I used to know a guy,
a master counterfeiter.

332
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:49,801
The Beast killed him, but...

333
00:14:49,845 --> 00:14:51,586
But that was in your timeline.

334
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:53,762
I did know Franky
since before Brakebills,

335
00:14:53,805 --> 00:14:55,982
so hopefully your Penny did too.

336
00:14:56,025 --> 00:14:59,463
And hopefully
he has the same number.

337
00:15:01,465 --> 00:15:03,598
Damn it.

338
00:15:03,641 --> 00:15:05,295
I still have the DJ's phone.

339
00:15:07,994 --> 00:15:09,430
Well, the good news
is your Penny

340
00:15:09,473 --> 00:15:10,779
has the same password as me,

341
00:15:10,822 --> 00:15:12,650
so I'm downloading
his contacts right now.

342
00:15:12,694 --> 00:15:15,566
Ugh.
So many Insta notifications.

343
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,264
Okay, I got his number.
I'll try him.

344
00:15:17,307 --> 00:15:18,700
I can't log in.

345
00:15:18,743 --> 00:15:19,919
It wants to send a text message

346
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:21,442
to my old phone to confirm,

347
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:22,660
but if I had my old phone,

348
00:15:22,704 --> 00:15:24,706
why the hell
would I be doing this?

349
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,448
Have you talked
to your dad lately?

350
00:15:27,491 --> 00:15:29,667
I called him from Brian's phone,

351
00:15:29,711 --> 00:15:31,365
but nobody picked up.

352
00:15:31,408 --> 00:15:32,714
Nobody answers their phone

353
00:15:32,757 --> 00:15:34,368
when they don't recognize
the number, right?

354
00:15:34,411 --> 00:15:35,978
You're probably right.

355
00:15:36,022 --> 00:15:37,675
Guys, he picked up.

356
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:42,942
Oh, I don't think
you can park there.

357
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:44,987
Yeah, I don't think he cares.

358
00:15:45,031 --> 00:15:47,816
Shit just always seems
to work out for Franky.

359
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:49,426
Another timeline?

360
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,775
That's wild.

361
00:15:50,819 --> 00:15:52,516
I thought you were dead.
Likewise.

362
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,083
So the Franky I knew
was a counterfeiter.

363
00:15:54,127 --> 00:15:56,390
So am I, but for most jobs,

364
00:15:56,433 --> 00:15:57,826
my skills are overkill.

365
00:15:57,869 --> 00:16:00,655
Duping objects to fool
regular dopes is simple.

366
00:16:00,698 --> 00:16:02,831
99% of the art you see
in museums is fake,

367
00:16:02,874 --> 00:16:04,659
because why waste the real thing

368
00:16:04,702 --> 00:16:06,400
on people who can't tell
the difference anyway?

369
00:16:06,443 --> 00:16:07,923
Fooling Magicians, though,

370
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,012
that's where the special sauce
comes in.

371
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:11,448
So what's the MacGuffin?

372
00:16:11,492 --> 00:16:12,754
A Library Black Card.

373
00:16:14,538 --> 00:16:16,323
That's gonna take
a lot of sauce.

374
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,065
You know what?
Let me get that.

375
00:16:19,108 --> 00:16:20,370
That's probably for me.

376
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:26,724
- Congratulations...
- Not now, guys.

377
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,641
You know what?

378
00:16:30,685 --> 00:16:31,642
Actually, I'm gonna grab...

379
00:16:31,686 --> 00:16:32,861
Thank you. Thanks.

380
00:16:32,904 --> 00:16:33,949
Have a good one.

381
00:16:39,563 --> 00:16:41,435
Are you gonna explain that,
or...

382
00:16:41,478 --> 00:16:43,437
- Are they even your size?
- They're always my size.

383
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:46,353
Anyway, uh, Library Black Card.

384
00:16:46,396 --> 00:16:47,702
That's tricky, but I can do it.

385
00:16:47,745 --> 00:16:49,791
Yeah, what'll it cost us?

386
00:16:49,834 --> 00:16:52,054
Whatever you're withdrawing
from the Library,

387
00:16:52,098 --> 00:16:53,795
double it.

388
00:16:53,838 --> 00:16:55,666
Ten Dewey coins?

389
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,755
That's like "raise an army
of the dead" level magic.

390
00:16:57,799 --> 00:16:59,366
That is a big ask.
Yeah.

391
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:01,933
If my forgery works,
it won't matter.

392
00:17:01,977 --> 00:17:04,066
Now, I'm gonna need some stuff.

393
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:06,155
I'm gonna need at least two
minutes with a real Black Card

394
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:08,679
to use as a mold,
two Philly cheesesteaks,

395
00:17:08,723 --> 00:17:11,943
four liters of cherry soda,
not store brand...

396
00:17:11,987 --> 00:17:13,902
that's a deal breaker.
I know. I know.

397
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:15,077
And at least a third
of a Dewey coin

398
00:17:15,121 --> 00:17:16,557
to get us started.

399
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,559
You need a battery
to get more batteries?

400
00:17:18,602 --> 00:17:20,778
Yeah.
Call it, uh, seed magic.

401
00:17:20,822 --> 00:17:22,911
Oh, uh...
we can't exactly

402
00:17:22,954 --> 00:17:25,044
walk into the Library
and just ask for one.

403
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:27,437
Well, there's a game of Push
happening tonight.

404
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:28,525
What's Push?

405
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:30,005
It's a card game.

406
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,920
High rollers play for Deweys,

407
00:17:31,963 --> 00:17:33,791
but you can buy in for less.

408
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:35,837
Any of you good at cards?

409
00:17:42,191 --> 00:17:44,802
A Magic card game is hard
under normal circumstances,

410
00:17:44,846 --> 00:17:45,934
but right now the Library's

411
00:17:45,977 --> 00:17:46,935
only putting out enough magic

412
00:17:46,978 --> 00:17:48,284
for small-scale spells.

413
00:17:48,328 --> 00:17:50,939
I mean, one big transformation,

414
00:17:50,982 --> 00:17:53,115
and I'm gonna black out
the entire room.

415
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:54,421
Yeah, it's about efficiency.

416
00:17:54,464 --> 00:17:56,205
Some Magicians are semi trucks,

417
00:17:56,249 --> 00:17:58,033
guzzling magic
to do a simple spell.

418
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,904
Some of us are Priuses.

419
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:01,515
What are you?

420
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:03,212
A sensible, mid-sized...

421
00:18:03,256 --> 00:18:05,040
What was the one that would
always explode?

422
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,302
Yeah, that.

423
00:18:06,346 --> 00:18:08,261
Hey, can we back him up?

424
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:12,178
No, no, not... not me.

425
00:18:12,221 --> 00:18:13,570
I can't even make a spark.

426
00:18:13,614 --> 00:18:16,138
I'm... well, I'm...
kind of persona non grata

427
00:18:16,182 --> 00:18:18,314
at Push games
in this city, so...

428
00:18:18,358 --> 00:18:19,533
I just don't want to.

429
00:18:19,576 --> 00:18:21,012
It's a one-on-one game, anyway,

430
00:18:21,056 --> 00:18:22,144
so no backup.

431
00:18:22,188 --> 00:18:24,277
But, uh, good luck.

432
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:27,497
What do you have to wager?

433
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:30,152
It's a protection amulet.

434
00:18:30,196 --> 00:18:31,197
It's sort of all-purpose.

435
00:18:35,244 --> 00:18:36,985
It's not good enough.

436
00:18:37,028 --> 00:18:39,596
If you can't buy in,
make room for somebody who can.

437
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:42,512
Uh, wait.
Um, he's a Traveler.

438
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,300
I'll wager his exclusive
services for 48 hours.

439
00:18:47,343 --> 00:18:48,649
- A year.
- A month

440
00:18:48,692 --> 00:18:50,172
- Whoa, hold on.
- I won't lose.

441
00:18:50,216 --> 00:18:52,174
But you're a loser.

442
00:18:52,218 --> 00:18:54,089
A month.
No questions asked.

443
00:18:55,351 --> 00:18:57,440
Welcome to the game.

444
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,582
Kay, the rules of Push
are simple.

445
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:09,626
It's like the game War.

446
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:10,888
Two players.

447
00:19:10,932 --> 00:19:12,107
Each draws a card.

448
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,065
High card wins the hand.

449
00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:15,937
When the deck is gone,
the game's over.

450
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,374
But the real art of the game
is knowing how to cheat.

451
00:19:23,553 --> 00:19:25,512
See, a... a shuffled deck of cards

452
00:19:25,555 --> 00:19:27,122
is not a fixed thing.

453
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,950
It's a cloud of possibilities...

454
00:19:33,302 --> 00:19:35,609
And you can change the odds
if you know how.

455
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,144
Put the right card
into your hand,

456
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,407
or the wrong card
into your opponents.

457
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:07,249
Wait, what is that?

458
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:11,253
Rules of Poker.

459
00:20:15,475 --> 00:20:17,172
You'll have to beat
three opponents

460
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,478
to win the whole thing.

461
00:20:18,521 --> 00:20:20,349
Shall we?

462
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,447
The more probability spells
that you throw around,

463
00:20:31,491 --> 00:20:34,624
the more improbable
things can get.

464
00:20:39,063 --> 00:20:40,456
Be careful of those.

465
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,979
They killed Bobby Darin.

466
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,291
The final round is when
you play for the Dewey.

467
00:21:31,812 --> 00:21:33,683
Breaking a tie is complicated.

468
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:35,119
Get the hats.

469
00:21:35,163 --> 00:21:36,860
You throw cards into a hat,

470
00:21:36,904 --> 00:21:39,254
and whichever you sink,
you score like a poker hand.

471
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:55,357
Straight flush.

472
00:21:59,883 --> 00:22:02,364
I'm just saying,
what if he loses?

473
00:22:02,408 --> 00:22:03,583
I'm a Traveler.

474
00:22:03,626 --> 00:22:05,280
I'll grab the coin
and blip away.

475
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,369
Yeah, and then the people
you just robbed

476
00:22:07,413 --> 00:22:09,328
hunt you down and torture you.

477
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:11,460
So why don't we save that
for plan B?

478
00:22:12,896 --> 00:22:15,551
Listen, if you lose
this last hand,

479
00:22:15,595 --> 00:22:16,552
it's over.

480
00:22:16,596 --> 00:22:17,553
I think we need

481
00:22:17,597 --> 00:22:18,554
to be ready for plan B.

482
00:22:37,268 --> 00:22:39,358
What is the point
of this display?

483
00:22:45,276 --> 00:22:48,149
You've used up all
the ambient magic in the room.

484
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:57,593
I guess we'll just
have to play an honest game.

485
00:23:20,355 --> 00:23:21,443
Got it.
Perfect.

486
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:22,923
Now the easy part.

487
00:23:22,966 --> 00:23:24,881
Borrow a Black Card
to use as a template.

488
00:23:27,493 --> 00:23:29,538
- Anything?
- No.

489
00:23:31,801 --> 00:23:33,412
Why are we going along
with this?

490
00:23:34,848 --> 00:23:36,589
Marina killed my mother.

491
00:23:36,632 --> 00:23:37,938
That was a different Marina.

492
00:23:37,981 --> 00:23:40,244
How different?

493
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,421
Are we just gonna
hand her a nuclear bomb?

494
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:43,900
What's the alternative?

495
00:23:43,944 --> 00:23:45,946
We use it against her.

496
00:23:45,989 --> 00:23:48,470
Where does that end?

497
00:23:48,514 --> 00:23:51,255
I'm... I came here to get away
from that kind of shit.

498
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:53,344
You know,
I'm getting really sick

499
00:23:53,388 --> 00:23:54,868
of being the voice
in the back of the room

500
00:23:54,911 --> 00:23:57,348
that everyone ignores.

501
00:23:57,392 --> 00:23:59,481
The other me, Sam,

502
00:23:59,525 --> 00:24:01,483
did whatever
she thought was right,

503
00:24:01,527 --> 00:24:03,267
regardless of what
anybody else thought.

504
00:24:03,311 --> 00:24:05,748
I get it...

505
00:24:05,792 --> 00:24:08,969
because where I came from,
everyone I cared about is dead.

506
00:24:09,796 --> 00:24:11,580
No other voice
to listen to but mine.

507
00:24:12,755 --> 00:24:15,758
But maybe Sam didn't care
what anyone else thought

508
00:24:15,802 --> 00:24:16,933
because she was alone.

509
00:24:18,369 --> 00:24:19,762
You aren't.

510
00:24:25,376 --> 00:24:26,508
Whoa.

511
00:24:26,552 --> 00:24:28,249
I got something here.

512
00:24:28,292 --> 00:24:31,513
There's huge energy
coming off her purse.

513
00:24:31,557 --> 00:24:33,384
It's gotta be the Black Card
in there.

514
00:24:33,428 --> 00:24:34,429
Showtime.

515
00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:39,739
Oh, excuse me, I'm...

516
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:41,784
I'm... I'm sorry.

517
00:24:41,828 --> 00:24:43,220
Do I know you from somewhere?

518
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,875
I mean, I dabbled in acting.

519
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,269
What have I seen you in?

520
00:24:48,312 --> 00:24:52,447
Let's just say some
provocative films of the 1970s.

521
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,318
Interesting.

522
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:11,727
All finished.

523
00:25:11,771 --> 00:25:13,424
Great.
Let's go.

524
00:25:13,468 --> 00:25:15,426
Uh, there is one little thing.

525
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:17,820
That special sauce
I was talking about before.

526
00:25:17,864 --> 00:25:20,693
Most forgers use
complicated illusion work.

527
00:25:20,736 --> 00:25:22,912
That's not quite my thing.

528
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,751
Did a bird just bring you
a sandwich?

529
00:25:35,795 --> 00:25:37,579
Yeah, I guess she did.

530
00:25:37,623 --> 00:25:39,059
You want it?

531
00:25:39,102 --> 00:25:41,365
Well, I mean, yeah, but...

532
00:25:41,409 --> 00:25:42,889
But what the fuck, Franky?

533
00:25:42,932 --> 00:25:44,325
This is what I'm talking about.

534
00:25:44,368 --> 00:25:46,283
Luck is my discipline.

535
00:25:46,327 --> 00:25:47,850
The forgeries I make
give whoever's holding them

536
00:25:47,894 --> 00:25:49,373
insanely good luck.

537
00:25:49,417 --> 00:25:50,679
So nobody even bothers to check

538
00:25:50,723 --> 00:25:52,333
if the thing is fake.

539
00:25:52,376 --> 00:25:53,769
I've done the spellwork
so many times,

540
00:25:53,813 --> 00:25:56,032
I'm just sort of encrusted
with it.

541
00:25:56,076 --> 00:25:58,731
Luck is zero-sum,
so all that bad luck

542
00:25:58,774 --> 00:26:00,341
has got to go somewhere.

543
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,476
It goes into a bear?

544
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,567
Somebody, not me,
has to hold that

545
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,786
while the others bring
the Black Card to the Library.

546
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:14,573
And whoever's holding it
is gonna have a bad day.

547
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:16,879
- I'll do it.
- No, Jules.

548
00:26:16,923 --> 00:26:18,838
You don't have to. He...
It's-it's okay.

549
00:26:20,056 --> 00:26:23,973
It's hard to explain,
but I'm kind of bulletproof.

550
00:26:24,017 --> 00:26:25,845
If anybody should have
terrible luck,

551
00:26:25,888 --> 00:26:27,368
it should be me.

552
00:26:27,411 --> 00:26:28,499
Why are you bulletproof?

553
00:26:28,543 --> 00:26:30,806
That's none of your business.

554
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,460
Pick it up.

555
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:42,339
No, no, no, no, no, no,
something's wrong.

556
00:26:42,383 --> 00:26:44,124
Uh, whatever
"none of my business" shit

557
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:45,647
is going on with you,
it's interfering

558
00:26:45,691 --> 00:26:47,910
with the fortune spell,
so set it down.

559
00:26:47,954 --> 00:26:49,956
Set it down!
All right.

560
00:26:49,999 --> 00:26:51,131
Dahh...

561
00:26:53,002 --> 00:26:55,004
Looks like you just volunteered.

562
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:06,799
You awake?

563
00:27:06,842 --> 00:27:08,017
Nope.

564
00:27:08,061 --> 00:27:10,019
It's time.

565
00:27:49,102 --> 00:27:52,018
Anti-magic paint
on a magic lock.

566
00:27:52,061 --> 00:27:53,584
Wish I had thought of that
before those

567
00:27:53,628 --> 00:27:55,761
book-sniffing bastards
ruined Christmas.

568
00:27:55,804 --> 00:27:57,066
Shh.

569
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,072
Which way now?

570
00:28:03,116 --> 00:28:04,552
I don't know.
Something isn't right.

571
00:28:04,595 --> 00:28:06,467
This should continue straight.

572
00:28:07,642 --> 00:28:08,948
Well, you made this map

573
00:28:08,991 --> 00:28:10,732
by mind-controlling a cockroach.

574
00:28:10,776 --> 00:28:11,994
Shouldn't we trust our eyes

575
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:14,475
rather than some
shit-eating bug?

576
00:28:16,651 --> 00:28:18,479
No, I think it's an illusion.

577
00:28:18,522 --> 00:28:20,133
There's spellwork on this wall.

578
00:28:33,102 --> 00:28:34,495
Or it's a wall.

579
00:28:49,815 --> 00:28:52,078
This is it.
The books of everyone.

580
00:28:52,121 --> 00:28:54,515
You look for yours, and I'll
go look for my friends'.

581
00:28:55,995 --> 00:28:58,780
I gotta tell you,
it is such a relief

582
00:28:58,824 --> 00:29:00,956
to take off that Ember disguise.

583
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,653
So what have I been missing
down on Earth?

584
00:29:02,697 --> 00:29:03,785
It must be bad.

585
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:06,048
Your chakras are all fucked up.

586
00:29:06,092 --> 00:29:07,702
Oh, yeah.

587
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:10,139
Uh, we got magic turned back on.

588
00:29:10,183 --> 00:29:11,184
Hey.

589
00:29:11,227 --> 00:29:12,663
And, you know,

590
00:29:12,707 --> 00:29:15,014
one of our friends
just betrayed us...

591
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:18,060
Which is crazy, right?

592
00:29:18,104 --> 00:29:20,802
Like, who would do that?

593
00:29:20,846 --> 00:29:22,586
- Yeah.
- I got mind wiped.

594
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:23,892
Yeah, I was living

595
00:29:23,936 --> 00:29:26,982
as this other dude
named Isaac for months.

596
00:29:27,026 --> 00:29:29,680
Um... that is exactly

597
00:29:29,724 --> 00:29:31,813
kind of close to my situation.

598
00:29:32,683 --> 00:29:36,209
So I'm being hunted
by this douchebag monster,

599
00:29:36,252 --> 00:29:38,689
and, like, I need a place
to crash, right?

600
00:29:38,733 --> 00:29:40,213
That's when I remember

601
00:29:40,256 --> 00:29:41,954
that squirrely little
human friend of yours

602
00:29:41,997 --> 00:29:44,783
said that he killed Ember,

603
00:29:44,826 --> 00:29:47,176
and I'm like, "I could
take that guy's place."

604
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,526
Live to fuck another day,
you know?

605
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,006
It's kind of nice, you know?

606
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:55,184
Freeing to... to live as
someone else for a little bit.

607
00:29:55,228 --> 00:29:57,012
Yeah, I guess.

608
00:29:57,056 --> 00:30:01,016
You know,
a famous cocksman once told me,

609
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,844
"Once you've had quantity,

610
00:30:02,888 --> 00:30:05,281
the only thing left
is strange."

611
00:30:06,587 --> 00:30:09,329
And, boy, is this place
full of strange.

612
00:30:09,372 --> 00:30:12,245
I mean, Isaac's life was great.

613
00:30:12,288 --> 00:30:16,553
Lot of friends,
big, uh... family.

614
00:30:18,164 --> 00:30:20,906
But eventually, it...
it all ends,

615
00:30:20,949 --> 00:30:22,995
and your old life,

616
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:25,736
your old problems,

617
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,042
they catch up to you.

618
00:30:27,086 --> 00:30:28,739
Or your problems never find you

619
00:30:28,783 --> 00:30:30,306
and the party goes on forever.

620
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:33,570
Oh, look at that, I'm dry.

621
00:30:33,614 --> 00:30:36,660
Is that... did you make for me?

622
00:30:36,704 --> 00:30:38,837
- Yes.
- Josh special?

623
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,230
Uh, yes.
I... I made it for you.

624
00:30:41,274 --> 00:30:45,626
You and me, Joshy,
we're the same.

625
00:30:45,669 --> 00:30:47,889
We're born to be
the perfect hosts.

626
00:30:47,933 --> 00:30:51,066
We want everyone around us
to have a good time.

627
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,763
We make sure of it.

628
00:30:52,807 --> 00:30:54,853
Nobody does the same for us.

629
00:30:54,896 --> 00:30:56,028
Mm-mm.

630
00:30:56,071 --> 00:30:58,769
This is to Josh, not to Isaac.

631
00:30:58,813 --> 00:31:00,075
This is to the real you.

632
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,039
I'm sorry.

633
00:31:07,082 --> 00:31:09,911
I... I pee-peed in it,

634
00:31:09,955 --> 00:31:12,174
and you don't...
you don't drink that.

635
00:31:12,218 --> 00:31:13,393
So...

636
00:31:15,699 --> 00:31:18,877
This the dumbest plan.

637
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,922
Franky says the disguises
won't matter.

638
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:24,230
If the Black Card works,
nobody will question them.

639
00:31:24,273 --> 00:31:26,058
I feel like an idiot.

640
00:31:26,101 --> 00:31:27,798
Excuse me, sir.

641
00:31:27,842 --> 00:31:29,713
You have a fresh look.

642
00:31:29,757 --> 00:31:31,324
Have you considered modeling?

643
00:31:34,762 --> 00:31:36,938
Kay, it's just soup.

644
00:31:38,157 --> 00:31:40,202
Can't choke.
It's not scalding.

645
00:31:40,246 --> 00:31:41,943
It's totally safe.

646
00:31:45,468 --> 00:31:48,341
Oh, look at that line.
This is gonna take forever.

647
00:31:48,384 --> 00:31:49,864
I've been thinking,
while we're here,

648
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,344
we should get a bit extra.

649
00:31:51,387 --> 00:31:55,087
Five for Marina,
five for Franky, ten for us.

650
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:58,307
We'd have to be insanely
lucky to get that much.

651
00:31:58,351 --> 00:32:02,007
The more luck we get,
the more bad luck Quentin gets.

652
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,704
When this is over,
the McAllisters

653
00:32:03,747 --> 00:32:05,662
will still be after us.

654
00:32:05,706 --> 00:32:10,145
We'll need to do
some major cloaking spell.

655
00:32:10,189 --> 00:32:11,799
It could kill him.

656
00:32:11,842 --> 00:32:13,975
Hey!
There's a truck outside

657
00:32:14,019 --> 00:32:15,672
giving out free ice cream!

658
00:32:17,413 --> 00:32:20,460
I mean,
two extra coins can't hurt.

659
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:25,030
It's... it's all good.
Soup spills all the time.

660
00:32:25,073 --> 00:32:27,032
Thanks.

661
00:32:27,075 --> 00:32:29,077
Damn it.

662
00:32:29,121 --> 00:32:32,124
How the hell do you get
a paper cut from a paper towel?

663
00:32:32,167 --> 00:32:34,343
- Welcome.
- Hi.

664
00:32:34,387 --> 00:32:37,912
So how can I help you today?

665
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,480
We need twelve contained
current coins.

666
00:32:44,223 --> 00:32:46,399
- Here.
- No, God.

667
00:32:46,442 --> 00:32:47,400
Keep it away.

668
00:32:51,056 --> 00:32:52,492
Everything looks in order.

669
00:32:52,535 --> 00:32:54,798
Just need to check
one little thing.

670
00:33:03,764 --> 00:33:04,721
Shoot.

671
00:33:08,769 --> 00:33:10,031
Did you hear something?

672
00:33:11,772 --> 00:33:14,035
Where did it come from?

673
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:16,255
Out of the... toilet.

674
00:33:16,298 --> 00:33:18,344
All right, then,
I'll send this requisition

675
00:33:18,387 --> 00:33:20,824
to the home office,
and they'll return your coins.

676
00:33:28,963 --> 00:33:31,052
I thought you said
your phone wasn't working.

677
00:33:38,277 --> 00:33:40,409
It's a voicemail from my mom.

678
00:33:40,453 --> 00:33:42,063
Do you think...

679
00:33:42,107 --> 00:33:43,847
Q.

680
00:33:43,891 --> 00:33:44,979
It's got to be about my dad.
I'm not gonna...

681
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,024
No, Q, the bear.

682
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,986
Okay.

683
00:33:56,469 --> 00:33:58,079
Oh.

684
00:33:58,123 --> 00:33:59,994
Your request has been flagged

685
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,952
for follow-up with a supervisor.

686
00:34:01,996 --> 00:34:03,171
Wait here, please.

687
00:34:08,394 --> 00:34:09,960
A requisition follow-up for you.

688
00:34:10,004 --> 00:34:12,180
Christ, can it wait?

689
00:34:12,224 --> 00:34:13,355
Fine.

690
00:34:28,588 --> 00:34:30,720
Sorry, I can't see for shit.

691
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,986
This bloody thing's
making me crazy.

692
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,597
Do you mind?
No.

693
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,815
Do... do your thing.

694
00:34:40,426 --> 00:34:41,775
What do I do?

695
00:34:41,818 --> 00:34:43,951
Just, please, don't listen to it

696
00:34:43,994 --> 00:34:45,779
until we hear back
from Penny and Katie.

697
00:34:47,433 --> 00:34:49,304
Oh, shit!

698
00:34:49,348 --> 00:34:52,525
Oh, Jesus Christ,
now I've got it in backwards.

699
00:34:55,702 --> 00:34:57,312
About those coins.

700
00:34:57,356 --> 00:34:59,488
Listen, the truth is,

701
00:34:59,532 --> 00:35:01,055
the red tape, the paperwork,

702
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,579
it's, in my mind,
all just a wank.

703
00:35:03,623 --> 00:35:04,928
You guys gonna
blow yourselves up?

704
00:35:04,972 --> 00:35:06,365
- No.
- No?

705
00:35:06,408 --> 00:35:07,844
Great.

706
00:35:07,888 --> 00:35:11,674
Requested... approved.

707
00:35:16,723 --> 00:35:18,812
Sorry about the inconvenience.

708
00:35:18,855 --> 00:35:20,727
Thank you very much.
You have a good day.

709
00:35:23,817 --> 00:35:25,471
Jesus, shit.

710
00:35:26,602 --> 00:35:27,821
Okay, they did it.
Drop the bear!

711
00:35:31,085 --> 00:35:32,956
It really came out of the...

712
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,697
I don't want to talk about it.

713
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:39,137
Thank you, brother.

714
00:35:40,268 --> 00:35:41,530
I had a feeling
things would work out,

715
00:35:41,574 --> 00:35:43,663
because they always do.

716
00:35:43,706 --> 00:35:45,621
By the way,
I'd destroy those ASAP.

717
00:35:45,665 --> 00:35:46,840
They'll be out of juice soon,

718
00:35:46,883 --> 00:35:49,059
but you don't want
to take any chances.

719
00:35:49,103 --> 00:35:50,670
I'm on it.

720
00:36:03,857 --> 00:36:06,468
You nutsacked out, didn't you?

721
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,646
Oh, well, "pussied out"
makes perfect sense here?

722
00:36:11,517 --> 00:36:13,736
Well, if you mean that
I couldn't go through with it,

723
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,477
then, yes, you're right.

724
00:36:15,521 --> 00:36:19,481
Josh, we don't
have a choice here.

725
00:36:19,525 --> 00:36:22,049
Now, where is the rest
of the Ambrosia?

726
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,661
Fine, but just know that Bacchus

727
00:36:25,705 --> 00:36:27,097
will never drink
anything you give him.

728
00:36:27,141 --> 00:36:29,578
Oh, I'm not gonna
give it to Bacchus.

729
00:36:29,622 --> 00:36:30,971
Yeah, I'm gonna
dump it in there.

730
00:36:31,014 --> 00:36:32,755
Everyone'll drink it.

731
00:36:32,799 --> 00:36:35,062
Are you nuts?
There are over 100 people here.

732
00:36:35,105 --> 00:36:37,064
You have no idea
what that will do to them.

733
00:36:37,107 --> 00:36:39,849
Well, I'm pretty sure
it'll fucking kill them.

734
00:36:39,893 --> 00:36:42,461
And I'll do it,
unless you start acting

735
00:36:42,504 --> 00:36:44,506
like a real pussy

736
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:48,031
and take one
for the fucking team.

737
00:36:49,903 --> 00:36:53,036
Hey, uh, I'm sorry about...

738
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:56,475
We've all peed in things
we regret.

739
00:36:58,607 --> 00:37:02,829
I know gods are supposed
to be distant and unknowable,

740
00:37:02,872 --> 00:37:04,874
but you're a good guy.

741
00:37:07,877 --> 00:37:09,531
I want to tell you a secret.

742
00:37:14,449 --> 00:37:17,713
What did you put... in this?

743
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,718
I found my book.

744
00:37:22,762 --> 00:37:23,980
Now let's get
the hell out of here.

745
00:37:24,024 --> 00:37:25,591
I can't find my friends' books.

746
00:37:26,896 --> 00:37:28,942
"The following books have been
removed from circulation

747
00:37:28,985 --> 00:37:31,423
for revisions.
Q. Coldwater, A. Quinn."

748
00:37:32,598 --> 00:37:34,991
They're filling in
the endings of our books...

749
00:37:35,035 --> 00:37:36,428
the pages that were missing

750
00:37:36,471 --> 00:37:37,951
because of the Great Blank Spot.

751
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:46,960
Nick?

752
00:37:48,875 --> 00:37:50,964
Hey, I'm sorry about
your friends' books,

753
00:37:51,007 --> 00:37:53,096
but this is our chance.

754
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,534
Come with me.
I can't.

755
00:37:55,577 --> 00:37:57,927
I... I can't leave
without their books.

756
00:37:57,971 --> 00:37:59,755
Well, I want to do the...

757
00:37:59,799 --> 00:38:01,757
Look, just go, while
you still have the chance.

758
00:38:01,801 --> 00:38:03,933
Okay, I can find
the Revision Room on my own.

759
00:38:05,761 --> 00:38:07,763
For what it's worth,

760
00:38:07,807 --> 00:38:09,809
you're still on my Nice List.

761
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,134
The fuck?

762
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:49,196
Do you remember me?

763
00:38:50,545 --> 00:38:52,199
Because I don't.

764
00:38:53,548 --> 00:38:57,030
I don't remember my name
or where I came from.

765
00:38:58,423 --> 00:39:00,860
But I remember you.

766
00:39:00,903 --> 00:39:04,646
You took something from me,
something important,

767
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:08,563
and then you...
threw me in a cage,

768
00:39:08,607 --> 00:39:12,915
and I would like
for you to explain.

769
00:39:12,959 --> 00:39:15,657
You remember all that,

770
00:39:15,701 --> 00:39:18,399
but you don't remember
what you are,

771
00:39:18,443 --> 00:39:20,314
what you did.

772
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:22,534
The word "monster"
has been thrown around.

773
00:39:22,577 --> 00:39:24,362
That's right.

774
00:39:24,405 --> 00:39:26,929
We put you with
the rest of your kind.

775
00:39:28,061 --> 00:39:29,454
And I ate them.

776
00:39:29,497 --> 00:39:32,195
You're kind of making my case
for me here.

777
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:34,546
We have the same parents.

778
00:39:34,589 --> 00:39:37,070
Why am I a monster
and you're a god?

779
00:39:37,113 --> 00:39:39,072
If you don't want
to be a monster,

780
00:39:39,115 --> 00:39:40,552
then let me go.

781
00:39:40,595 --> 00:39:42,118
Give me back
what you took from me,

782
00:39:42,162 --> 00:39:43,250
and maybe I will.

783
00:39:45,295 --> 00:39:47,950
I can't... ever.

784
00:39:47,994 --> 00:39:49,430
I'm sorry.

785
00:39:50,562 --> 00:39:52,302
It was a part of me,

786
00:39:52,346 --> 00:39:56,089
and now it's a part of you.

787
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:02,530
Burning in your body.

788
00:40:02,574 --> 00:40:04,227
Wait. Wait.

789
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:06,316
This world needs me.

790
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,318
Its god is dead.

791
00:40:08,362 --> 00:40:10,190
You don't have to do this.

792
00:40:10,233 --> 00:40:12,453
There's others.
There's still time.

793
00:40:12,497 --> 00:40:14,368
We can figure something out.

794
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,935
It doesn't have to be me.

795
00:40:15,978 --> 00:40:18,590
It doesn't have to...

796
00:40:38,523 --> 00:40:40,742
What the fuck did he
just rip out of him?

797
00:40:40,786 --> 00:40:42,744
Whatever it is, to a fairy eye,

798
00:40:42,788 --> 00:40:46,008
it's like staring
straight at the sun.

799
00:40:49,185 --> 00:40:50,360
They're real.

800
00:40:52,188 --> 00:40:53,625
Well, it's been a pleasure.

801
00:40:55,191 --> 00:40:56,758
The trackers on us?

802
00:40:56,802 --> 00:40:58,630
Not actually a thing.

803
00:40:58,673 --> 00:41:00,762
You guys are too lawful good
to bitch out.

804
00:41:09,771 --> 00:41:11,730
- Marina.
- Hmm?

805
00:41:11,773 --> 00:41:13,732
I've been looking for you.

806
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,781
Excuse me, miss.

807
00:41:19,825 --> 00:41:21,304
These are free to a good home.

808
00:41:21,348 --> 00:41:22,654
Are you interested?

809
00:41:28,311 --> 00:41:30,183
Hey, are you sure
Marina's apartment's

810
00:41:30,226 --> 00:41:31,663
the safest place for us to meet?

811
00:41:31,706 --> 00:41:33,491
It's not Marina's.

812
00:41:34,361 --> 00:41:35,536
It's mine.

813
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,581
What did you do?

814
00:41:36,624 --> 00:41:38,191
I handled the problem.

815
00:41:38,234 --> 00:41:41,063
Now, can we do this
cloaking spell

816
00:41:41,107 --> 00:41:43,065
before the McAllisters show up
and kill all of us?

817
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:49,028
Hey.

818
00:41:49,071 --> 00:41:51,204
You haven't listened?

819
00:41:51,247 --> 00:41:54,512
You know, your bad luck's gone.

820
00:41:54,555 --> 00:41:56,818
Safe as it'll ever be.

821
00:41:56,862 --> 00:42:01,257
But that's not
what's really stopping you.

822
00:42:01,301 --> 00:42:03,608
The other me...

823
00:42:03,651 --> 00:42:06,088
Brian,

824
00:42:06,132 --> 00:42:08,526
his dad died when he was a kid.

825
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,181
He was too little
to even understand.

826
00:42:12,834 --> 00:42:15,228
All of his problems
were like that.

827
00:42:15,271 --> 00:42:16,708
No sharp edges.

828
00:42:16,751 --> 00:42:17,752
Yeah.

829
00:42:19,449 --> 00:42:21,539
Look at us.

830
00:42:21,582 --> 00:42:23,845
We paid a hell
of a fucking price.

831
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,762
You gave up being a goddess.

832
00:42:30,417 --> 00:42:32,375
I gave up my father.

833
00:42:37,424 --> 00:42:39,208
What did we get in return?

834
00:42:40,253 --> 00:42:41,297
Magic is back.

835
00:42:46,215 --> 00:42:48,609
Mm-mm, not in the way
that we wanted.

836
00:42:51,351 --> 00:42:54,397
How are you not furious?

837
00:42:57,662 --> 00:43:02,449
Because, for almost everyone,
the world is a little brighter,

838
00:43:02,492 --> 00:43:06,105
even if they never know why.

839
00:43:06,148 --> 00:43:09,325
I hate the Library
for what they did,

840
00:43:09,369 --> 00:43:13,460
but my part in it,
I knew what it cost.

841
00:43:14,809 --> 00:43:17,507
And I'd do it again.

842
00:43:21,947 --> 00:43:23,644
But you wouldn't.

843
00:43:26,778 --> 00:43:29,389
Will you sit here for a minute?

844
00:43:29,432 --> 00:43:30,651
Yeah.

845
00:43:33,915 --> 00:43:36,875
Hi, Quentin.

846
00:43:36,918 --> 00:43:39,791
Sorry to leave a message
with bad news.

847
00:43:41,575 --> 00:43:43,925
I need to talk to you
about your father.
