1
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:08,120
Previously, on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,860
Look, just go while you still
have the chance.

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,290
The Library controls
the levels of ambient magic

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,700
that flow through the pipes.

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,220
This one has a leak.

6
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,610
Well, what's my Birthright,
you scaly shit?

7
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:26,570
It's the talking animals.
They've all been struck dumb.

8
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,570
- So what is this?
- I saved your fucking life, bitch.

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,490
Margo, are you okay?

10
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,430
You're just a brown-nose sweater boy

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,190
desperate to matter at all.

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,670
The other me, Sam,

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,100
did whatever she thought was right,

14
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,790
regardless of what anybody else thought.

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,240
This contract initiates
our services in exchange for...

16
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,760
"Unlimited manual and magical labor"?

17
00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,000
"Bound in service to the Library
up to and after my death"?

18
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,510
- Penny, where are you?
- I'm in the Underworld Library.

19
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,230
If you stay down here,

20
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,690
you've got an amazing destiny
ahead of you.

21
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,710
Uh, excuse me?

22
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,060
Mr. Adiyodi?

23
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:24,240
Come in. Have a seat.

24
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,980
Is...

25
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,850
Did I do something wrong?

26
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,700
I called you in to talk
about Matilda Fremont.

27
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:32,510
You shelved her book yesterday

28
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,680
under "Disappointing Prodigies"?

29
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,460
Oh, right.

30
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,560
Uh, mastered the flute at seven
but became a mediocre poet.

31
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:40,900
Unremarkable.

32
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:42,600
Did you read her brother's book?

33
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:43,930
She saved his life...

34
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,040
pulled him out
of a self-destructive spiral,

35
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,690
and he went on to become

36
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,440
one of the world's
greatest philanthropists.

37
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,740
I wouldn't call that "unremarkable."

38
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:58,240
Uh, okay. So is there section for,
uh, "Sisters of Generous Men"?

39
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,790
You've been in the Underworld branch,

40
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,750
- um, three weeks?
- Well...

41
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,840
Yeah, when I died, all I cared about

42
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,760
was getting back up there,
and... and all this?

43
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,850
I didn't think it mattered...

44
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,460
where a book goes, who reads it.

45
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:18,199
Those books I lent you,
you get a chance to read them?

46
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,470
Of course.

47
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:21,600
Well, I skimmed.

48
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:22,990
How far did you get?

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,910
Alice, uh, opened a pipe,

50
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,340
accidentally helped blow up
the Modesto branch,

51
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:30,660
and Quentin played Pictionary
with a mummy.

52
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,910
Where would you file them?

53
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,350
Quentin and Alice...

54
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,310
"Star-Crossed Romances," probably,

55
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,790
or "Well-Meaning Failures."

56
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,960
- What about the others?
- Oh...

57
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,920
"Side Characters in Epic Quests."

58
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,450
I'm a side character?

59
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,140
Look, no offense.

60
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,280
It's just... Quentin's the center
of the whole thing.

61
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,340
He's the one that knows everybody.

62
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,020
He's the one the little
British girl picked

63
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,980
to save the world.

64
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,630
Or he's the one that looks like you.

65
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,840
Not fair.

66
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,120
Todd looks like me.
He's not the center of shit.

67
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,410
But he could be.

68
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:08,690
All I'm saying is you think you've
seen stories like this before,

69
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,040
so you can guess
what's going to happen...

70
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:14,040
who's important and who isn't.

71
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,130
But that's because you are
trapped in your POV.

72
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,050
You have a classic case of
White Male Protagonism, Derek,

73
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,180
and a Librarian simply can't have that.

74
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,920
But that's why these books
are so important.

75
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,580
They're such a gift.

76
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,840
They... they can allow you
to see other points of view.

77
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,450
And once you start seeing that,

78
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,670
you'll find that the story
doesn't end the way you think,

79
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,460
and the most important characters
aren't who you expect.

80
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,820
Remember back before
all the stuff in Modesto

81
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:53,470
when Alice first escaped
from the Library?

82
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,040
Oh, dear.

83
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,740
I'm telling you, I saw

84
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,700
a reindeer-driven sleigh fly away.

85
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,520
Alice and Nick are gone.

86
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:02,700
This is not funny.

87
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:06,400
I'm not laughing... now.

88
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,230
- I mean...
- Lets discuss next steps.

89
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,750
Mm, we should wait for Everett.
He'll know how to...

90
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,620
Oh, he'll agree with me when I say
that Alice Quinn was your project.

91
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:17,670
Holding her here was a mistake.
We aren't jailers.

92
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,540
What would you have done?

93
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,510
Alice broke her deal with us.

94
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,770
She tried to turn off all of magic.
That has to have consequences.

95
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,550
Our mission is to preserve
the knowledge of magic.

96
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,970
Alice Quinn is an existential
threat to that knowledge.

97
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,770
Are you suggesting that
we should have killed her...

98
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,780
And Santa Claus?

99
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,900
I'm so sorry. It's not at all funny.

100
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,710
Do you agree with Cyrus?

101
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,380
I see.

102
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:53,180
I admit, I took a personal interest
in Alice's rehabilitation.

103
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,100
Perhaps it biased me.

104
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,620
You are correct.

105
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,450
We are not jailers.

106
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,500
Nor are we killers.

107
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,890
So I'll ask again...
what would you have us do?

108
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,810
"Protect the flame of knowledge

109
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,760
no matter the cost."

110
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,460
I believe that's how the old motto goes.

111
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,590
Everett.

112
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,990
Sorry I was delayed.

113
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,210
The renovation of our Rome branch
ran into some difficulties.

114
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,950
Have you been briefed on Alice?

115
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,600
I agree with Zelda.

116
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,740
We are an order of scholars,
not assassins.

117
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,560
So what is the scholarly solution?

118
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:26,830
Read their books.

119
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,130
Learn their intentions.

120
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,160
We agreed not to breach privacy
unless there was no other option.

121
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,350
What's the other option?

122
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,010
Uh, okay.

123
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,600
Well, Nick's book has been taken

124
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,170
and presumably destroyed,

125
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:45,150
but Alice's is still in the Revision
Room having the ending put in.

126
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,760
Which will take days,

127
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,630
and if she and Nick split up,
we'll lose them.

128
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,630
There might be another way.

129
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,550
Tracking devices.

130
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,070
Eventually, they'll go
somewhere for help.

131
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,550
There isn't enough ambient

132
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,340
to keep either of them happy long,

133
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:01,019
so disperse a Searcher widely and...

134
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,820
Disperse to whom, though?

135
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,730
I find it unlikely that Alice or Nick

136
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,040
will run into the hands
of card-carrying Magicians.

137
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,350
- They'll go underground.
- Yes.

138
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,590
Where the hedge witches are.

139
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,050
And the hedge witches don't trust us.

140
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,830
- We'll never get them to accept...
- If we do what I'm thinking,

141
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,500
they'll take them without ever knowing.

142
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,930
Fine. Trackers.

143
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,670
And once Alice's book is back,

144
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,670
if we can verify
she's no longer a threat,

145
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,020
there'd be no need
for further corrective action.

146
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:30,510
Agreed?

147
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,770
All in favor?

148
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:44,080
Hmm.

149
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,310
You seem troubled.

150
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:50,040
Thank you, but I'm fine.

151
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,740
I understand.

152
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,870
I see something of Harriet
in Alice, too.

153
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,310
I wish you'd given yourself some
real time to grieve your daughter.

154
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,050
- Leave of absence, even.
- No, I'm...

155
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,280
Uh, I'm sorry.

156
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,240
Zelda.

157
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,940
I thought I heard something.

158
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,340
Excuse me, I have a meeting.

159
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,990
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

160
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,300
So you're telling me the Head Librarian,

161
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,740
a member of the
Governing Council of the Order,

162
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,440
is having a nervous breakdown?

163
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,340
Trust me, just 'cause she's
seeing shit that no one else sees

164
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,790
doesn't mean it isn't really there.

165
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,140
Uh, then we got to get
a message to this Everett guy.

166
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,450
He's in charge, right?

167
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,750
Can't.

168
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,090
What do you mean? There's
a dragon that connects

169
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,180
the Underworld to the Neitherlands.

170
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,260
We just take a note, and
we shove it up his...

171
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:58,280
Not how that works.

172
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:01,170
- Look, being down here...
- You mean being dead?

173
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,110
It gives you a new perspective.

174
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,619
There's shit we know is going to happen

175
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,680
that people up there would
give anything to stop.

176
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,640
But we can see the bigger picture.

177
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:14,250
It's not our job to stop the
living from doing what they do.

178
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,950
It's our job to appreciate
their full life.

179
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,780
We see but do not intervene...

180
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,000
for a lot of good reasons.

181
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,660
I can see this is wigging you out.

182
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,750
Let's start with an easier one.

183
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,970
Well, what's my Birthright,
you scaly shit?

184
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,790
Wait...

185
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,320
I read this one last week.

186
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:37,970
High King of Fillory gets mad
at, uh, the alpaca lady,

187
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:42,280
uh, to bring back
the talking animals' voices.

188
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:43,940
You read Margo's story.

189
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:46,160
This one is not about her.

190
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:49,330
Well, what's my Birthright,
you scaly shit?

191
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,730
Oh, hi, there.

192
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,340
Do you have a message, or...?

193
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,430
Oh!

194
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,480
Okay, it was a dream.

195
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:06,180
Just keep reading.

196
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:09,840
Well, what's my Birthright,
you scaly shit?

197
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,360
It's the talking animals.

198
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:16,880
They've all been struck dumb.

199
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,490
Well, shit.

200
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,020
All right, Fen, I think
I will do a ritual.

201
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,370
Earth specialty...
the Sleep of Solitude.

202
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,850
I pop an Ambien, everyone
leaves me alone till noon.

203
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,860
That'll be perfect.

204
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,200
Rafe, last night I had
the strangest dream.

205
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:37,210
There were these bunnies
with their throats...

206
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:38,860
You know what?

207
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,990
I think I projected
the talking animals going mute.

208
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,720
Okay, I think I'm starting to
get the point of these stories.

209
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,040
All women are just one emotional
crisis away from a psychotic break.

210
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,570
Jesus, no.

211
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,310
Whoa, you can't say stuff
like that anymore.

212
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,530
What, in the afterlife?

213
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,050
Anywhere.

214
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,880
Do you remember what Kady
was doing at this time?

215
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,380
Didn't she just kind of peace out

216
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,060
after the Library Dewey coin heist?

217
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,170
Not exactly.

218
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,599
See, while the others
were busy bleeding a stone

219
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,240
to stop the monster, Kady...

220
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,460
was busy doing something else.

221
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,380
Iris could have at least left us

222
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,420
a stone-bleeding how-to or something.

223
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:20,170
Yeah, I hear what you're saying, Q.

224
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,210
- Hey.
- Don't mind me.

225
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:31,430
Uh, I'll go check those other books.

226
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,620
The books in, uh, Marina's library,

227
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,800
'cause, uh, yep, that's got
to be where they are.

228
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,440
Hey.

229
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,270
Haven't seen you in a while.

230
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,190
There was some stuff I had to do.

231
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,360
Stuff I should be worried about?

232
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,100
I'm clean.

233
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,570
Good.

234
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,630
Who's this?

235
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,250
Five weeks ago, her dad picked her
up from school and disappeared...

236
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:02,160
custody fight with her mom.

237
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:05,600
Locator spell and a few
bruised knuckles later,

238
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,170
she's home.

239
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:11,390
"Five weeks ago" as in when you
were "Detective Sam Cunningham"?

240
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,130
You're solving her old case files?

241
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,960
All right, look...

242
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,130
you lived as Kim for months.

243
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,350
The moment you got
your memory back, you just...

244
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,830
you dropped it like it never happened.

245
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,840
I-I can't.

246
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,880
I can't go back to being a sidekick.

247
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:29,320
- You're not a sidekick.
- Come on.

248
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:32,010
I'm only in this group at all
because of Penny.

249
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,410
That's not true.

250
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,370
- You and me...
- We're friends, yeah.

251
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,330
And then we weren't,
and now we're what...

252
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,030
I don't know,
whatever you call it when...

253
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,330
you have a lot of history

254
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,410
that made you two very different people.

255
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,570
I need my own path, Jules.

256
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:52,210
I want my life to feel
like it's about me.

257
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,170
No, I get that.

258
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,830
And I am all for your personal growth.
It's just that we're...

259
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,140
you know, we're kind of
under the gun here.

260
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:01,550
You're under my roof,
hidden from the McAllistairs

261
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,719
and the Library because I took
this place from Marina

262
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,220
when everyone else wanted

263
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,370
to hand her nuclear launch codes.

264
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,250
Look, I'll help, of course...

265
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:17,110
when I can, in my way.

266
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,630
But for now...

267
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,280
Sam left a few loose ends
I need to tie up.

268
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,600
You're not my Postmate.

269
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,600
I am the Baba Yaga.

270
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:38,040
You live on my property
under my protection,

271
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,480
and your rent is due.

272
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:44,680
Okay, well, this isn't exactly my place.

273
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,440
Well, you're here now,

274
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,720
and the list is clearly posted
on the premises.

275
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,230
Wait, Marina's weird
grocery list on the fridge?

276
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,490
It is not weird.

277
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,400
You are weird.

278
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,590
You reek of nondairy creamer
and despair.

279
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,660
Okay, look, I don't have

280
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,240
whatever it is that you're looking for.

281
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,460
One Webster's Weeping Healer,

282
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,940
one Totem of the Plump Pelican,

283
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,990
and one Bag of Holding.

284
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,910
Pay what is owed in two days' time

285
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,600
or wish I boiled you alive.

286
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,250
The wench will explain.

287
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,600
What?

288
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:29,090
Holy shit, you have to pay her.

289
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,660
"Her"? You mean you.

290
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,090
Okay, what the fuck is happening?

291
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,440
I'm Bailey.

292
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,270
Sorry about the Baba Yaga.
She can be a little...

293
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,670
The Baba's the spirit
of a vengeful Slavic witch

294
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,540
I channel when I need to collect rent

295
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:42,450
or deal with a chatty Uber driver.

296
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,450
So if you don't want to be
her next meal,

297
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,150
you should give her what she wants.

298
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,590
Ooh, stressful.

299
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,460
Where am I supposed to find...

300
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,030
Wait a minute.

301
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,330
Is the...

302
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,170
The Totem of the Plump Pelican.

303
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,250
Wait, this thing?

304
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,820
Oh, yeah, that's it.

305
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,210
Oh. Marina must have found it.

306
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,760
I just thought it was some
ugly paperweight.

307
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,560
Shh, don't insult it.

308
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,170
It reacts.

309
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,480
So two more to go.

310
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,220
Oh, shit.

311
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,310
She's coming back.

312
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,230
Pay me what is owed,

313
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:20,200
or I will boil your marrow
into soup, peasant.

314
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,500
See you Thursday.

315
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,560
I'm looking for a guy called "Lovelady."

316
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:38,880
Heard he has office hours here.

317
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:45,980
What is this?

318
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:48,340
- Some kind of flashlight spell?
- Isik.

319
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,300
- Jesus.
- Whoa!

320
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,110
Satisfied?

321
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,120
What the hell was that? I never want
to see the floor of a bar that bright.

322
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,290
Pete?

323
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:09,710
Wait, you're Lovelady?

324
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,410
Oh, shit.

325
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,020
Kady.

326
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,470
It's been a while.

327
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:17,090
Last time I saw you,
you were with Marina.

328
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,480
Mm.

329
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,120
We parted ways. It was mutual.

330
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:22,140
Mm, I'm sure.

331
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,939
- So "Lovelady," huh?
- It's a title.

332
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,560
When one guy's done with it, he
passes it on to the next guy,

333
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,530
kind of like "Dread Pirate
Roberts" or "Senator."

334
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,510
That's not how Senators work.

335
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,910
Whatever.

336
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,980
The guy who was "Lovelady before me"

337
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:41,380
is an Earl with a private island.

338
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,120
People respect the shit out of me.

339
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,030
It's a great sign when
you have to tell people that.

340
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,250
Did you come here looking
for my help or...?

341
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,860
Sorry.

342
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:57,740
Here's a list.

343
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,310
I heard you can find things.

344
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,660
Interesting stuff.

345
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,740
Specific.

346
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,920
Landlord issue.

347
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,270
Have you considered moving?

348
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,750
The place has special features.

349
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,090
It just turns out it's courtesy
of a-a witch...

350
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,890
uh, Baba-something.

351
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,630
You mean the Baba Yaga?

352
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,110
- You know her?
- Just by reputation.

353
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,240
Hey, if I help you,

354
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:24,250
in lieu of my usual fee,
I want you to introduce me.

355
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,730
- Not sure she's your type.
- She's got great taste.

356
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,790
This could open up
a whole new avenue for me.

357
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,660
Yeah, fine, whatever. You'll help?

358
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,820
One more thing.

359
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,260
Um, do you still see Julia?

360
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,350
Don't be a creep, Pete.

361
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,320
Where are we going?

362
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,010
Black Market.

363
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,140
So Kady's moved on.

364
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,880
I mean, not with Pete, just...

365
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,360
I know what you mean,

366
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:58,150
and I'm happy for her.

367
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,150
You don't look happy.

368
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,850
So is there some sort of connection

369
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,420
I'm supposed to be seeing between Kady,

370
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,460
Zelda, Fen...

371
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,160
You'll see.

372
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:15,820
Alice's book had been revised, but
Alice had changed the ending.

373
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:18,040
- Well?
- Apparently, Alice feels

374
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,130
magic has caused her
nothing but trouble.

375
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,390
She goes on to live out an entirely
civilian life in Portland.

376
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,960
She just got a job at a craft brewery,

377
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,400
and a Shih Tzu.

378
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,180
You look a little surprised.

379
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,180
Does that not sound like her?

380
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,010
The choice is unexpected, but...

381
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,320
wouldn't be the first time
she walked away from magic.

382
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:39,190
Great, then.

383
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,570
Nick is still at large, so we'll
keep our trackers in circulation,

384
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,280
but I think we can close
the book on Alice Quinn.

385
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,110
It's funny...

386
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:50,660
I'd always thought she was a cat person.

387
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,420
Never seen her before. Sorry.

388
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:57,030
She would be a new hire.

389
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,210
We're not hiring right now.

390
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,570
In fact, we've had to
let some people go.

391
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:04,070
Designer hops are getting expensive.

392
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,640
Well?

393
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,830
Alice is inside, as her book said.

394
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,000
Hmm. Good riddance, book tart.

395
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,200
Let's go get some doughnuts.

396
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,540
This is the Black Market?

397
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,590
- It's so...
- Normal?

398
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,370
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

399
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:33,070
You'd be surprised
what you can find in here.

400
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,340
Even Deweys.

401
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,640
Wait, I thought you had to
have a Library card for that?

402
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,030
Yeah, well, the Library
should know better

403
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,040
than to give unlimited black cards

404
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:44,200
to rich druggie dickbags that
trade them in for lap dances.

405
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:46,350
Oh, so you give lap dances, huh?

406
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,780
Selectively.

407
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,480
Okay, so that is Whitley.

408
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:54,570
If she does not have a Bag of
Holding, she'll have a line on one.

409
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,900
What, you're not gonna introduce me?

410
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,660
Well, I may have had sex with her

411
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,010
and never called her again.

412
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,390
Classy.

413
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,320
Hey, I'm looking for a Bag of Holding...

414
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,500
whatever that is.

415
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,540
It's a "Doctor Who" kind of thing.

416
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,280
A bag that's bigger on the inside.

417
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,020
Actually, it's a D&D thing.

418
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,450
Yeah, I don't do nerd shit.

419
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:17,750
Expensive taste for someone who
doesn't know what they're asking for.

420
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,720
I can pay.

421
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,280
Charisma Cufflinks...

422
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:26,290
for a Bag of Holding?

423
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:29,070
Come back when you're serious.

424
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:39,120
Kraken tentacles... helps build muscle.

425
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:40,250
I'm paleo.

426
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,820
Cavemen didn't eat kraken,
so I don't eat kraken.

427
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,920
What'll you give me for these?

428
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,130
Aleister Crowley's ashes.

429
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,000
- Mm-hmm.
- Not bad.

430
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,320
Worth a Bag of Holding?

431
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,860
Thanks.

432
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,980
What the hell, Pete? I searched
the whole goddamn market for you.

433
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,020
Kady, great news.

434
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:21,760
I found Gordy. Gordy's my, um...

435
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,130
- He's great.
- Hi, Kaitlin.

436
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,350
Kady.

437
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:30,720
You were supposed to be looking for
the Webster's Weeping Whatever,

438
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,900
not getting wasted.

439
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,300
¿Por qué no los dos, mamacita?

440
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:37,680
I'll have you know Gordy is a doctor.

441
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,050
- Well...
- For animals.

442
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,910
You know, for dogs and cats.

443
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,520
Don't sell yourself short, all right?

444
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,440
- That's a real doctor.
- Ok... shh, shh, shh. Not helpful.

445
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:50,530
Yes, helpful, because Gordy knows

446
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,270
where to get that thing
that you're looking for.

447
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,150
The thing. The creepy doll
that cries healing tears.

448
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,370
Webster's Weeping Healer.

449
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:01,460
Got a buddy, Duke... exotic-bird guy.

450
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,540
So his cockatoo caught bumblefoot...

451
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:04,980
Okay, shh.

452
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:06,290
Duke has the doll?

453
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,680
Well, yeah.

454
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,590
Okay, where can I find him?

455
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:16,650
Hello? Anybody there?

456
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,210
I'm guessing no one's home.

457
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:32,100
Well, that explains it.

458
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:38,170
No sign of blunt-force trauma
or defensive wounds.

459
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,860
Doesn't look like foul play.

460
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,870
Okay, Mariska Hargitay.

461
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,970
Just find the doll, will you?

462
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,750
No, bad touch!

463
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,100
Get off!

464
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:04,720
God, I hate this place.

465
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,280
But...

466
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,980
found the doll.

467
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,590
Ugh.

468
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,030
Healing tears or no,

469
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,650
I would not keep this thing in my house.

470
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,820
Really, Pete?

471
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,820
What? He's not using it.

472
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,090
You're disgusting.

473
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:38,790
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

474
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,540
Jesus, Fen!

475
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,540
Why the hell are you lurking
in a dark pantry?

476
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,780
Waiting for you.

477
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:51,000
Your soufflé fell.
You're gonna bake a new one.

478
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:53,580
- How did you...
- Dreamt it.

479
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,950
You're worried Margo is gonna
blow talks with Lady Pike.

480
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,090
Wait, again with the alpaca lady?

481
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,120
Sorry.

482
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,910
Uh, some of these pages
are out of order.

483
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,350
Just keep reading.

484
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,380
But really, you're worried
that you and she have

485
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,330
a true connection and you're
going to screw it up,

486
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,800
- so you're stress-baking.
- Okay, ouch.

487
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:16,700
And that's a weirdly specific
and accurate dream.

488
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,570
I also dreamt of dancing ears of corn,

489
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,680
and then the farmers reported a surplus.

490
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,270
I dreamt about what Tick really does

491
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,899
with all those peaches
he steals from the kitchen,

492
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,410
which is surprisingly not gross.

493
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,890
And they've all come true.

494
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,980
Prophetic dreams could mean
a lot of things.

495
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:34,070
Uh, maybe you're a psychic

496
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,550
or someone cast some kind
of spell on you.

497
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:40,070
Or... or it's Fillory, and maybe
you just ate some messed-up fruit.

498
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,030
You think someone did this to me?

499
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,820
If you're worried, next time it happens

500
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,950
just poke around the dream a little.

501
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,000
Poke with what? A knife?

502
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:51,140
No. No knives. Lucid dreaming.

503
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:52,890
They teach it first semester
at Brakebills.

504
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,300
The second you realize you're dreaming,

505
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,960
you can take control of your dream.

506
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,530
You don't even need magic to do it.

507
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,620
Just close your eyes...

508
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:02,530
Breathe, and try to push your finger

509
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,320
through your other hand.

510
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:05,840
Everything freezes.

511
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:09,060
Anything not supposed to be there,
that's when you'll be able to tell.

512
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:12,010
Alice wasn't where
her book said she'd be.

513
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:15,010
I suspect she sabotaged it.

514
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,140
And now I've lied to my colleagues.

515
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:21,080
If I don't find her
before they find out...

516
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,070
Sounds like a personal problem.

517
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,760
Henry, please.

518
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,460
I'm trusting you.

519
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,370
What you mean is that you trust

520
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:34,070
that I won't report this

521
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,860
- because it'd be worse for Alice.
- We both want to spare her that.

522
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:39,470
If you could just tell me
where she is...

523
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,390
I comply with every request...

524
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,830
all your red tape
and your triplicate bullshit.

525
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,750
This is your mess.
Do not drag me into it.

526
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,330
Harriet?

527
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,840
_

528
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,420
_

529
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,790
I don't think an ancient Slavic
witch is gonna want a mojito.

530
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,490
Right, um...

531
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,230
something vodka-based?

532
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,230
Are you actually nervous?

533
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,860
Baba Yaga's a really big deal

534
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,620
in my line of work, and...

535
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:01,760
First impressions...

536
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:05,070
- What was I saying?
- Pete, your arm.

537
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,710
Ah...

538
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:11,560
that molest-y hand gave me the clap.

539
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,530
Oh, shit.

540
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:17,270
Looks like a bad spell interaction.

541
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:19,830
Something's clashing with one
of his personal enchantments.

542
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,040
Which personal enchantment?

543
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,960
I don't know. They're personal.

544
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,820
Hedge spells, you know,
they're off the street at best.

545
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,190
They got a lot of rough edges.

546
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,400
There's really no telling
if they'll play nice together

547
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:31,420
until, well, they don't.

548
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,740
Whatever killed Duke is killing him.

549
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,560
So help him, or I break your jaw.

550
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,779
Look, the only human
diagnostic spell I know

551
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,170
costs magic, and I'm a little
Dewey-light at the mo...

552
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,790
Please don't break my jaw.

553
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,490
Fine.

554
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,800
Pete has one he took off
your friend Duke.

555
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:50,320
Wait. Wait, you said
something's clashing with Pete.

556
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:51,340
Mm-hmm.

557
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,810
- Like what?
- Like a cursed object.

558
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,920
I once treated a horse for strangles.

559
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,050
Turns out jockey's riding crop
interacted badly

560
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,460
with a hoof-protection spell, so...

561
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:02,510
Does Pete carry a riding crop?

562
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,210
Okay, maybe just look at this.

563
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,000
Cobalt.

564
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:09,410
Don't touch that shit.

565
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,660
Not really planning to
now that you licked it.

566
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:14,530
What? It's more accurate than lenses.
You can taste cobalt.

567
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,010
It's used in most tracking spells.

568
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,530
- "Tracking spells"?
- Mm-hmm.

569
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:20,530
I put them on pets. This one tastes
like a real expensive Searcher.

570
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,620
You hold it long enough,
it kind of sends out

571
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:24,410
a signal to whoever cast it.

572
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,020
Wait, a-a signal to wh... who?

573
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,200
Aliens.

574
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,760
I was thinking more
like who makes Deweys.

575
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,760
- The Library.
- Oh, yeah.

576
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:34,550
That makes more sense.

577
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,770
Who's the Library looking for?

578
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,640
Oh, I can think of a few people.

579
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:41,470
Wait, how many hedges have
these personal enchantments?

580
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,560
Pretty much everybody.

581
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:44,910
Shit.

582
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,650
- Take off all of Pete's, now.
- What are you gonna do?

583
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,430
I'm gonna warn everybody.

584
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,520
Wait a second. So the Library's
responsible for hedge witches dying?

585
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:56,570
Yeah, but they don't know that yet.

586
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,020
Spoiler alert.

587
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:00,360
Zelda had some other things
on her mind at the time.

588
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:01,880
Her dead daughter.

589
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,080
Wait, is she, like, down here?

590
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:07,930
I thought you didn't like spoilers.

591
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,760
Look, I'm sorry you see dead people,

592
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:11,580
but that is an incredibly stupid idea.

593
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,940
She's not dead. Ghosts don't bleed.

594
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:16,920
I don't know how, but she could
be alive stuck in there.

595
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,940
That's insane... and impossible.

596
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,420
It's the Mirror Realm.

597
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:23,030
We don't know what's impossible.

598
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,080
It's not as complicated
as a mirror bridge.

599
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:27,470
We just need to open a door
to the place between mirrors.

600
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,250
Listen, Zelds, if you told me you wanted

601
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,100
to finger-paint your blood
so you could take a walk

602
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,520
in the crazy dimension
I would say, "Free country."

603
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:35,440
But this is my blood.

604
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,960
I can't do this...

605
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:39,570
without your help.

606
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,960
Yes, I know that.

607
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,140
- And I'm leaving.
- She's my daughter.

608
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,150
Harriet...

609
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,670
who's older than you?

610
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,890
Our relationship is complicated.

611
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,500
Clearly.

612
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,800
You smashed the mirror.

613
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:58,680
You...

614
00:28:58,690 --> 00:28:59,940
trapped her there.

615
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,160
I was doing my job.

616
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:04,510
I can't...

617
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:08,030
Live with myself if I don't
find a way to help her.

618
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,740
Please.

619
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,560
Christ.

620
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,700
I'm gonna regret this, aren't I?

621
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,400
- Did you juice the beets?
- Oh, I juiced the beets.

622
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:29,140
I told you I would juice the beets.

623
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:32,140
- Why wouldn't I juice the beets?
- Don't make this about us.

624
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,840
Wait, did I miss something?

625
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:38,450
I thought Margo and Josh were an
unlikely yet heartwarming thing.

626
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,890
No, this is after
the Lady Pike incident.

627
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:43,550
Margo called Josh a sweater boy.

628
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,850
Forget it.

629
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,420
Pay attention to Fen.

630
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:48,120
How's this shit work?

631
00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:52,510
Pour it gently
onto the lizard, Your Majesty.

632
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,930
Jesus lizard-fucking Christ!

633
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:13,930
Does this feel like a weird
sort of dream to any of you?

634
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:21,070
All right, maybe I can control this.

635
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:31,120
Ember's balls. This is a dream.

636
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:35,000
Okay, okay. Stop talking to
yourself and, uh, look around.

637
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,600
Hey!

638
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:39,730
Who are you?

639
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,600
Wait, no! Stop, please!

640
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:43,080
Freeze! Freeze!

641
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:45,000
Hey, hey, stop!

642
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,580
Freeze! Green Lady!

643
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,619
Hold up!

644
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,670
Hey, Green Lady, come back!

645
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,460
Umber's ass, this is getting annoying.

646
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,020
Hey, wait!

647
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,760
Wait, I just want to talk!

648
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,940
Why am I having these stupid dreams?

649
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,550
Oh, no.

650
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,120
The lizard.

651
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:18,990
You pour it gently
onto the lizard, Your Majesty.

652
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,900
Wait, stop! It'll catch fire!

653
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:22,510
The fuck?

654
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:25,520
I saw the lizard blow up

655
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:27,950
when Rafe...

656
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,610
Antidote.

657
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,570
What is she talking about?

658
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,130
Perhaps she's mad with grief

659
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,570
over the loss of King Eliot,
Your Majesty.

660
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,050
I assure you, all the animals

661
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,530
have responded quite positively
to the antidote.

662
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,840
Well, this one definitely won't.

663
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:44,540
Foosh. Fried Lizard.

664
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:47,110
And where are you getting
this information?

665
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,540
I...

666
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,110
I dreamt it.

667
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,340
Fen has been having
kind of prophetic dreams.

668
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:59,880
She knew my soufflé was gonna
fall before that ever happened.

669
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,360
It's a stupid fucking premonition.

670
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:03,480
You want to risk the life of your
lizard, or is that a relationship

671
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,380
- you're willing to set fire to as well?
- Oh, I'll fucking fry this lizard.

672
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,870
Okay, can we... can we focus
for one minute?

673
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,030
- Sure.
- Yes.

674
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,170
- Fine.
- Let's.

675
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,240
- Cool.
- Great.

676
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:14,040
Okay.

677
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:17,050
Say I don't dose
Newt Scamander with beet juice.

678
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:20,140
How the shit am I supposed
to get his wrinkly ass talking?

679
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:22,010
I don't know, but I have an idea

680
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:25,010
of where to look for answers.

681
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,750
I lucid-dreamed.

682
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,890
I saw a woman in a green hood.

683
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,190
She has to be the one
giving me premonitions.

684
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,720
Awesome. You got it working.

685
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:34,890
- A-plus.
- B-minus.

686
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,370
Unless...

687
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:39,160
you tell us where this green bitch went.

688
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:42,330
Well, in my dream,
I chased her to this stream

689
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:45,080
by the Fuchsia Forest of Corian's Land.

690
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:47,250
Corian's Land...

691
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,910
also known as Sloth's Bane.

692
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,780
I don't know what everything
in my dreams means... mean.

693
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:55,740
Anyway, I know that the answers

694
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,090
to our questions...
answers lie... lay there?

695
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,920
I-I'm not usually the one

696
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:02,380
who gives the big speech,
so I'm... I'm going.

697
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,240
So that... that's happening.

698
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:16,240
Gordy says "you're welcome."

699
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,090
And he left you a bill.

700
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:21,450
That guy puts a really
high value on his time.

701
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,570
Wait, did I miss the Baba Yaga?

702
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,790
Well, you snooze, you lose.

703
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,270
I wasn't snoozing, I was dying.

704
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,920
We got bigger fish to fry.

705
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,580
I'll explain everything

706
00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:38,280
as soon as your hedge witch
friends get here.

707
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:43,150
I know every instinct is telling you

708
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,930
not to trust me... or anyone.

709
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:49,290
But someone put a tracker on this.

710
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,550
It's a complex, expensive,

711
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,820
very high-level spell.

712
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,600
It marked him.

713
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:03,200
It looks like the Deweys you touched

714
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,200
are doing the same to you.

715
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,290
If you have any enchantments running...

716
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,560
anything you got in a safe house,

717
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,600
anything homebrewed...
it could kill you...

718
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:14,230
just like it did to Duke
and almost did to Pete.

719
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:17,610
She saved my life.

720
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,830
I trust her, and I vouch for her.

721
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,520
- Who did this?
- The Library.

722
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:25,739
They make the Deweys,
and they don't give a shit

723
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:27,750
about what happens to the hedges.

724
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,490
They're trying to find someone,

725
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,660
and we're just collateral damage.

726
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:35,850
So ask yourselves...
if this is what they do

727
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:38,680
when they're not even thinking about us,

728
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:41,690
what happens when they decide
we're a threat?

729
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,500
Are we just gonna let people like them

730
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,950
tell us we're not important?

731
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,059
That we're just some side characters

732
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:56,700
in their fucked-up fascist plot?

733
00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:00,360
My mom was a hedge...

734
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:04,230
and she was killed by another hedge.

735
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,890
You'd think that would
turn me against you.

736
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,850
But it didn't.

737
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:15,630
It just made me realize that
it doesn't have to be this way.

738
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,240
If we could stop
screwing each other over

739
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,460
long enough to work together,

740
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:24,030
then it's not the Library's story.

741
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,860
It's our story.

742
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:34,390
Hey.

743
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,390
I have a buddy in Modesto.

744
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,350
He says there's a leaky
Library pipe there.

745
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,050
I say we use it
to make those assholes pay.

746
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,790
Look, I know
what you're going through...

747
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:46,080
Do you? They kill your boyfriend?

748
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:47,940
Actually, yeah.

749
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:52,320
Look, we'll figure out what to do next.

750
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:53,580
I already know what to do.

751
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:57,500
You do that, you're giving
them a reason to wipe us out.

752
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:01,290
Please just get a little sleep.
We'll talk tomorrow.

753
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,990
Hey, you're not alone, okay?

754
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,960
We'll figure this out together in
a way that feels right for you.

755
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,560
Okay.

756
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:12,440
Yeah, we can do that.

757
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:28,790
It's a copy of our library, but wrong.

758
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:33,320
I was gonna say a total mindfuck.

759
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:35,020
Tomato, tomah-to.

760
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,630
Oh, you go on.

761
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:42,630
I'll just be here cutting myself
to keep our bloody exit open.

762
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,910
Hey, just made a joke.

763
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,780
Hello?

764
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:59,760
_

765
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:01,920
_

766
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,770
_

767
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:09,860
_

768
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:13,070
_

769
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:16,860
_

770
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,680
_

771
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,840
_

772
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,300
_

773
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,640
_

774
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:33,000
_

775
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:46,000
Where have you been?

776
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:49,540
Your funhouse-mirror daughter
shanked me. We have to go.

777
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,050
Those things weren't her. The real
Harriet could still be in here.

778
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:54,080
- I can't just leave her.
- I hate to break it to you, love...

779
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:56,460
she might still be in there,
but so are those monsters.

780
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:18,130
An attack?

781
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,570
On what branch?

782
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:22,050
Modesto, California.

783
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,490
We lost four Librarians.

784
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,230
Hedge witches did it.

785
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,270
But... but why?

786
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,980
There was some fallout
from your tracker coins.

787
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:37,200
It's not your fault.

788
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:39,370
Just unforeseen interaction.

789
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,550
Several hedges died.

790
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:46,470
The whole point of doing this was
to avoid having to hurt anyone.

791
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,210
I should have been here.

792
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,900
You can't blame yourself.

793
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:53,170
If anything, today we learned
the true danger we're in

794
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:56,140
and that your trackers
might provide a solution.

795
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,610
What do you mean?

796
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:02,050
Complications aside...

797
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,040
the idea is sound.

798
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:08,010
Put whatever we have
into circulation among them.

799
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:11,400
We keep Modesto from happening again.

800
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:14,630
Are you suggesting
we kill hedge witches?

801
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,060
I am suggesting
that we keep an eye on them.

802
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:19,020
To "protect the flame of knowledge"

803
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:22,340
from ever being extinguished,
no matter the cost."

804
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:26,910
I don't know what to say.

805
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:33,210
This is an awesome responsibility.

806
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:35,340
You and I both know that,
but who is better suited

807
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:38,950
to bear that responsibility
than The Order?

808
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:43,390
There is no one I trust more deeply

809
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,610
to be fair and right than you.

810
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,320
Alice.

811
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:59,030
I can't stay long. I-I cast a spell to
keep the Library from eavesdropping,

812
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,910
but it won't last.

813
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,760
I need your help.

814
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:06,150
They have my friend Sheila.

815
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,170
I know.

816
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:12,470
Hello, Ms. Quinn.

817
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,380
Alice, please.

818
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:16,640
Nothing will happen to you here.

819
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:18,720
Zelda wants to talk.

820
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,220
Why?

821
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,490
I need your help.

822
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:29,260
I think I've seen enough.

823
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:33,490
To counteract a lifetime
of cis-het frat-bro bias?

824
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:35,930
- I-I doubt it.
- Okay.

825
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:38,530
So tell me, what was I supposed
to take from that?

826
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:41,150
Zelda doesn't know it yet,
but what she just set in motion

827
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,410
is going to change the Library forever.

828
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:46,060
Same with Fen and Fillory,

829
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:49,150
Kady and all of magic.

830
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,240
When you file people away as sidekicks,

831
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:54,030
you don't realize
their importance to the story,

832
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,250
and this story belongs

833
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:59,210
to a lot more people than you think.

834
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,300
Where to shelve a book,

835
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,040
it's not a little thing.

836
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:05,470
You're telling the world what to value,

837
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,500
who to value.

838
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,660
You get our responsibility here?

839
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,530
Well said.

840
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:16,220
I think you've earned
the right to move up.

841
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:19,490
Excuse me?

842
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:23,100
I know so much about you
and your friends,

843
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:26,290
but you never asked me how I died.

844
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,720
O-okay, um...

845
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:32,760
- How did you die?
- Arrow to the chest...

846
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:34,420
during the Crusades.

847
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:35,550
"The Crusades"?

848
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,640
1,000 years ago?

849
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:39,250
We really thought the story

850
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:42,380
was all about white guys
back then, believe me.

851
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:45,210
And I'm not new at all.

852
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:49,210
I'm actually
your supervisor's supervisor.

853
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:51,740
So you're my boss.

854
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:54,610
I fully see the irony of a white
guy giving you this test,

855
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:58,880
but ladies upstairs love a
twist, so they always send me.

856
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:00,400
Send you to what?

857
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:02,270
To promote you.

858
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,800
You're clearly ready for the next level.

859
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:06,230
Which is?

860
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,320
Secrets Taken to the Grave.

861
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:10,500
You're gonna collect them.

862
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:12,490
Congratulations.

863
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:15,240
Thank you.

864
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:19,420
Oh, and, um, I'm afraid we're gonna
need you to start right away.

865
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:39,170
Hey.

866
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,110
Been a while.

867
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,760
Welcome to the Underworld.
