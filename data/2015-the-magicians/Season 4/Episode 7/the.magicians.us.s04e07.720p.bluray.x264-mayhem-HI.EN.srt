00:00:01,126 --> 00:00:03,209
PENNY: <i>Previously on</i>
The Magicians...

2
00:00:03,295 --> 00:00:05,207
Look, just go, while you
still have the chance.

SHEILA: <i>The Library

00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:11,551

5
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:13,094
<i>This one has a leak.</i>

6
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:18,516
Well, what's my birthright,
you scaly shit?

7
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:21,470
It's the talking animals.
They've all been struck dumb.

8
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:22,724
So what is this?

9
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:24,430
I saved your fucking life,
bitch.

10
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,399
Margo, are you okay?

11
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:29,398
You're just
a brown-nose sweater boy

12
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:31,024
desperate to matter at all.

13
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:32,400
The other me, Sam,

14
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:35,700
<i>did whatever she thought was right,

Penny, where are you?

20
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:46,439
I'm in the Underworld Library.

21
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,170
If you stay down here,

22
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:50,624
you've got an amazing destiny
ahead of you.

23
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,816
DEREK: Uh, excuse me?
Mr. Adiyodi?

24
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:18,493
Come in. Have a seat.

25
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:20,494
Is...

26
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:23,785
Did I do something wrong?

27
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,675
I called you in to talk
about Matilda Fremont.

28
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,331
You shelved her book
yesterday under

29
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:29,788
"Disappointing Prodigies"?

30
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,338
Oh, right. Uh,

31
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,418
mastered the flute at seven,
but became a mediocre poet.

32
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,511
Unremarkable.

33
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:36,877
Did you read
her brother's book?

34
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:38,717
She saved his life.

35
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:41,049
Pulled him out
of a self-destructive spiral,

36
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:44,887
and he went on to become one of
the world's greatest philanthropists.

37
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,518
I wouldn't call that
"unremarkable."

38
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:53,070
Okay. So, is there section
for "Sisters of Generous Men"?

39
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,694
You've been in the Underworld
branch, um, three weeks?

40
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,554
- Well... (SIGHS)
- PENNY: Yeah, when I died,

41
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:03,743
all I cared about was getting
back up there, and all this?

42
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,324
I didn't think it mattered.

43
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:09,042
Where a book goes,
who reads it.

44
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:13,081
Those books I lent you,
you get a chance to read them?

45
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,291
DEREK: Of course.

46
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:16,508
Well, I skimmed.

47
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:17,968
How far did you get?

48
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,887
Alice, uh, opened a pipe,

49
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,181
accidentally helped blow up
the Modesto branch,

50
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:25,556
and Quentin played <i>Pictionary</i>
with a mummy.

51
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:27,936
Where would you file them?

52
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:29,184
DEREK: Quentin and Alice,

53
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:32,642
"Star-Crossed Romances," probably,
or "Well-Meaning Failures."

54
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:34,735
What about the others?

55
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:36,188
Oh.

56
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,022
"Side Characters
in Epic Quests."

57
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,366
I'm a side character?

58
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,659
DEREK: Look, no offense.
It's just,

59
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:45,280
Quentin's the center
of the whole thing.

60
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:47,331
He's the one
that knows everybody.

61
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,062
He's the one
the little British girl picked

62
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:50,452
to save the world.

63
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,571
Or he's the one
that looks like you.

64
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:54,838
Not fair.

65
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:58,089
Todd looks like me.
He's not the center of shit.

66
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,339
But he could be.

67
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,681
All I'm saying is you think
you've seen stories like this before,

68
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:06,225
so you can guess
what's going to happen.

69
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:09,019
Who's important
and who isn't.

70
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:12,019
But that's because
you are trapped in your POV.

71
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:16,110
You have a classic case of
White Male Protagonism, Derek,

72
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,109
and a Librarian simply
can't have that.

73
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:21,949
But that's why these books
are so important.

74
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,242
They're such a gift.

75
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:27,371
They can allow you
to see other points of view.

76
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,824
And once you start
seeing that,

77
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,578
you'll find that the story
doesn't end the way you think,

78
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,960
<i>and the most important characters
aren't who you expect.</i>

79
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,839
<i>Remember back before
all the stuff in Modesto</i>

80
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,266
<i>when Alice first escaped
from the Library?</i>

81
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:49,765
Oh, dear.

82
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:54,141
I'm telling you,
I saw a reindeer-driven sleigh fly away.

83
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,519
- Alice and Nick are gone.
- This is not funny.

84
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:01,572
I'm not laughing now.
I mean...

85
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,191
Let's discuss next steps.

86
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:05,743
Mmm. We should wait for
Everett. He'll know how to...

87
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,320
Oh, he'll agree with me
when I say

88
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,076
that Alice Quinn
was your project.

89
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,950
Holding her here was
a mistake. We aren't jailers.

90
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,876
What would you have done?

91
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,079
Alice broke her deal with us.

92
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:20,215
She tried to turn off all of magic.
That has to have consequences.

93
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:23,378
Our mission is to preserve
the knowledge of magic.

94
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:26,306
Alice Quinn is an existential
threat to that knowledge.

95
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,425
Are you suggesting that
we should have killed her,

96
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,685
and Santa Claus?

97
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:32,772
(CHUCKLES)

98
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,765
I'm so sorry.
It's not at all funny.

99
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,776
Do you agree with Cyrus?

100
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:42,156
I see.

101
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:47,160
I admit, I took a personal interest
in Alice's rehabilitation.

102
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,870
Perhaps it biased me.

103
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,790
You are correct.
We are not jailers.

104
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,000
Nor are we killers.

105
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,872
So, I'll ask again.
What would you have us do?

106
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,753
EVERETT: "Protect the flame
of knowledge no matter the cost."

107
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,801
I believe that's how
the old motto goes.

108
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,466
CYRUS: Everett.

109
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,842
Sorry I was delayed.

110
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,176
The renovation of our Rome branch
ran into some difficulties.

111
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,885
Have you been briefed
on Alice?

112
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:13,979
I agree with Zelda.

113
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,394
We are an order of scholars,
not assassins.

114
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:20,443
So, what is
the scholarly solution?

115
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,112
Read their books.
Learn their intentions.

116
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:26,282
We agreed not to breach privacy unless
there was no other option.

117
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:27,529
What's the other option?

118
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:31,954
Uh, okay.

119
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,080
Well, Nick's book has been taken
and presumably destroyed,

120
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:40,083
but Alice's is still in the Revision Room
having the ending put in.

121
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,584
CYRUS: Which will take days,

122
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,507
and if she and Nick split up,
we'll lose them.

123
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,467
ZELDA:
There might be another way.

124
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:47,257
Tracking devices.

125
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:50,014
Eventually, they'll go
somewhere for help.

126
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,264
There isn't enough ambient
to keep either of them happy long,

127
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,016
so disperse a Searcher widely
and...

128
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,688
Disperse to whom, though?

129
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,482
I find it unlikely that Alice or Nick
will run into the hands

130
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:01,980
of card-carrying Magicians.

131
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,944
- They'll go underground.
- Yes.

132
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:05,633
Where the hedge witches are.

133
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:07,899
And the hedge witches
don't trust us.

134
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:09,273
We'll never get them
to accept...

135
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:12,320
If we do what I'm thinking,
they'll take them without ever knowing.

136
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,325
Fine. Trackers.

137
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,543
And once Alice's book is back,

138
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,621
if we can verify
she's no longer a threat,

139
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,957
there'd be no need
for further corrective action.

140
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,342
Agreed?

141
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:30,637
All in favor?

144
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,981
Thank you, but I'm fine.

145
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,437
I understand.

146
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,028
I see something of Harriet
in Alice, too.

147
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:54,283
I wish you'd given yourself
some real time to grieve your daughter.

148
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,035
- Leave of absence, even.
- No, I'm...

Excuse me, I have a meeting.

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

159
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:30,986
So, you're telling me
the Head Librarian,

160
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,863
a member of the
Governing Council of The Order,

161
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,411
is having
a nervous breakdown?

162
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,204
Trust me, just 'cause
she's seeing shit

163
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,326
that no one else sees

164
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,727
doesn't mean
it isn't really there.

165
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:42,164
Then we got to get
a message to this Everett guy.

166
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,369
He's in charge, right?

167
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,371
- Can't.
- What do you mean?

168
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,985
There's a dragon that connects
the Underworld to the Neitherlands.

169
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,092
We just take a note,
and we shove it up his...

170
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,340
Not how that works.

171
00:07:53,515 --> 00:07:55,848
- Look, being down here...
- You mean being dead?

172
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,013

a new perspective.

The place has
special features.

353
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:07,085
It just turns out
it's courtesy of a witch.

354
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:08,291

355
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,966
You mean the Baba Yaga?

356
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,719
- You know her?
- Just by reputation.

Hey, if I help you,
in lieu of my usual fee,

358

I want you to introduce me.

359
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:23,222
- Not sure she's your type.
- She's got great taste.

360
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:26,150
This could open up
a whole new avenue for me.

361
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:28,898
Yeah, fine, whatever.

362
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:29,988
You'll help?

Where are we going?

367
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,417

not with Pete, just...

I know what you mean,

371
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,543
and I'm happy for her.

372
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:54,962
You don't look happy.

373
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,219
So, is there some
sort of connection

374
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:01,473

had been revised,</i>

380
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,657
Apparently, Alice feels magic has
caused her nothing but trouble.

381
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,986
She goes on to live out
an entirely civilian life in Portland.

382
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,915
She just got a job at a craft
brewery, and a Shih Tzu.

383
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,825
You look a little surprised.

384
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:26,501
Does that not sound like her?

385
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,421
The choice is unexpected,

386
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:32,250
but wouldn't be the first time
she walked away from magic.

387
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,052
Great, then.

388
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:38,047
Nick is still at large, so we'll keep
our trackers in circulation,

the book on Alice Quinn.

she was a cat person.

Wait, I thought you had to
have a Library card for that?

406
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,405
Yeah, well, the Library should know better
than to give unlimited Black Cards

to rich druggie dickbags that
trade them in for lap dances.

she'll have a line on one.

gonna introduce me?

00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:31,801
because it'd
be worse for Alice.

525
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,423
We both want
to spare her that.

526
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:35,471
If you could just tell me
where she is...

527
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:39,050
I comply with every request,

528
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,558
all your red tape
and your triplicate bullshit.

529
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,568
This is your mess.
Do not drag me into it.

530
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,689
(TINNITUS RINGING)

531
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,506
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

532
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:15,212
Harriet?

533
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:16,716
(INAUDIBLE)

534
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,810
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

535
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,458
I don't think an ancient Slavic witch
is gonna want a mojito.

536
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:46,705
Right. Um...

537
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:48,995
Something vodka-based?

538
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:51,168
Are you actually nervous?

539
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:54,171
Baba Yaga's a really big deal
in my line of work, and...

540
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:55,961
First impressions...

541
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,923
- What was I saying?
- Pete, your arm.

542
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:06,430
That molest-y hand
gave me the clap.

543
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,605
Oh, shit.

544
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,627
GORDY: Looks like
a bad spell interaction.

545
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,272
Something's clashing with one
of his personal enchantments.

546
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:17,527
Which personal enchantment?

547
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:19,029
I don't know.
They're personal.

548
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:22,286
Hedge spells, you know,
they're off the street at best.

549
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:23,613
They got a lot of rough edges.

550
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,867
There's really no telling
if they'll play nice together

551
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,955
until, well, they don't.

552
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:30,253
Whatever killed Duke
is killing him.

553
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:33,207
So, help him,
or I break your jaw.

554
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,043
Look, the only human diagnostic spell
I know costs magic,

555
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,614
and I'm a little Dewey-light
at the mo.

556
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:38,879
Please don't break my jaw.

557
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:40,926
Fine.

558
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:43,383
Pete has one he took
off your dead friend Duke.

559
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:46,936
Wait. Wait, you said something's
clashing with Pete.

560
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,022
Mmm.

561
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,520
- Like what?
- Like a cursed object.

562
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,441
I once treated
a horse for strangles.

563
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:54,520
Turns out jockey's riding crop
interacted badly

564
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,400
with a hoof-protection spell,
so...

565
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,947
Does Pete carry a riding crop?

566
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:01,026
Okay, maybe just look at this.

567
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:03,907
(SPITS)

568
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,829
Cobalt. Don't touch that shit.

569
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:08,203
Not really planning to
now that you licked it.

570
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,909
What? It's more accurate
than lenses.

571
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:12,541
You can taste cobalt.
It's used in most tracking spells.

572
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,964
- Tracking spells?
- Mmm. I put them on pets.

573
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,916
This one tastes like
a real expensive Searcher.

574
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,799
You hold it long enough, it kind of
sends out a signal to whoever cast it.

575
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:24,473
- Wait, a signal to who?
- Aliens.

576
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:26,722
I was thinking more like
who makes Deweys.

577
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:29,349
- The Library.
- Oh, yeah.

578
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:30,725
That makes more sense.

579
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,727
Who's the Library looking for?

580
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:35,064
Oh, I can think
of a few people.

581
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:37,904
Wait, how many hedges have
these personal enchantments?

582
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,947
Pretty much everybody.

583
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,149
Shit.

584
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,450
Take off all of Pete's, now.

585
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:44,573
What are you gonna do?

586
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:46,575
I'm gonna warn everybody.

587
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:50,955
Wait a second. So, the Library's responsible
for hedge witches dying?

588
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,001
Yeah, but they
don't know that yet.

589
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,420
Spoiler alert.

590
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,964
Zelda had some other things
on her mind at the time.

591
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,291
Her dead daughter.

592
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,047
Wait, is she, like,
down here?

593
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,512
I thought you
didn't like spoilers.

594
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:08,180
Look, I'm sorry you see dead people,
but that is an incredibly stupid idea.

595
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,478
She's not dead.
Ghosts don't bleed.

596
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:13,398
I don't know how,
but she could be alive, stuck in there.

597
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,315
That's insane,
and impossible.

598
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:16,768
It's the Mirror Realm.

599
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:18,603
We don't know
what's impossible.

600
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,738
It's not as complicated
as a mirror bridge.

601
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:24,053
We just need to open a door
to the place between mirrors.

602
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:25,659
Listen, Zelds,
if you told me you wanted

603
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:28,391
to finger-paint your blood so you could
take a walk in the crazy dimension,

604
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,077
I would say, "Free country."

605
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:31,328
But this is my blood.

606
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,704
I can't do this
without your help.

607
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,209
Yes, I know that.

608
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,666
- And I'm leaving.
- She's my daughter.

609
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:43,382
Harriet,

610
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:45,888
who's older than you?

611
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:49,346
Our relationship
is complicated.

612
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,436
Clearly.

613
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,641
You smashed the mirror.

614
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:54,396
You

615
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:56,395
trapped her there.

616
00:28:56,485 --> 00:28:58,477
- I was doing my job.
- I can't

617
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:04,066
live with myself if I don't
find a way to help her.

618
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:08,994
Please.

619
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,744
Christ.

620
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,002
I'm gonna regret this,
aren't I?

621
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,759
- Did you juice the beets?
- Oh, I juiced the beets.

622
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,507
I told you I would
juice the beets.

623
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,384
Why wouldn't I
juice the beets?

624
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,885
Don't make this about us.

625
00:29:28,976 --> 00:29:30,296
DEREK:
<i>Wait, did I miss something?</i>

626
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:34,805
I thought Margo and Josh were
an unlikely yet heartwarming thing.

627
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:37,311
No, this is after
the Lady Pike incident.

628
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,896
Margo called Josh
a sweater boy.

629
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,436
Forget it.

630
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,771
Pay attention to Fen.

631
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:44,689
MARGO: How's this shit work?

632
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:47,951
Pour it gently onto the lizard,
Your Majesty.

633
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:59,124
(LIZARD SCREECHES)

634
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,423
Jesus lizard-fucking Christ!

635
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:09,093
Does this feel like a weird
sort of dream to any of you?

636
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,063
All right, maybe
I can control this.

637
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:27,156
Ember's balls.
This is a dream.

638
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:31,487
Okay, okay. Stop talking to
yourself and look around.

639
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:34,951
Hey!

640
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:36,123
Who are you?

641
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,075
Wait, no! Stop, please!

642
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,581
Freeze! Freeze!

643
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,378
Hey, hey, stop!

644
00:30:41,465 --> 00:30:43,832
Freeze! Green lady! Hold up!

645
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,416
Hey, Green lady, come back!

646
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,803
Umber's ass,
this is getting annoying.

647
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:04,779
Hey, wait!

648
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:07,150
Wait, I just want to talk!

649
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,364
Why am I having
these stupid dreams?

650
00:31:09,451 --> 00:31:12,114
(GASPS) Oh, no.
The lizard.

651
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,572
You pour it gently onto
the lizard, Your Majesty.

652
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,327
Wait, stop!
It'll catch fire!

653
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:18,953
The fuck?

654
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:23,254
I saw the lizard blow up
when Rafe...

655
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:25,627
Antidote.

656
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,167
What is she talking about?

657
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:32,175
Perhaps she's mad with grief
over the loss of King Eliot, Your Majesty.

658
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:34,803
I assure you, all the animals have
responded quite positively

659
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:35,929
to the antidote.

660
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,259
Well, this one
definitely won't.

661
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,395
Fwoosh!
Fried lizard.

662
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,607
And where are you getting
this information?

663
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,068
I... I dreamt it.

664
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:54,069
Fen has been having
kinda prophetic dreams.

665
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,391
She knew my soufflé was gonna fall
before that ever happened.

666
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:57,872
It's a stupid fucking
premonition.

667
00:31:57,958 --> 00:31:59,102
You want to risk
the life of your lizard,

668
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:01,270
or is that a relationship you're willing
to set fire to as well?

669
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,580
Oh, I'll fucking fry
this lizard.

670
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:05,209
Okay, can we focus
for one minute?

671
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,340
- Sure.
- Yes.

672
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:07,632
- Fine.
- Let's.

673
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:08,717
- Cool.
- Great.

674
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:09,802
MARGO: Okay.

675
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:13,589
Say I don't dose
Newt Scamander with beet juice.

676
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:16,595
How the shit am I supposed to get
his wrinkly ass talking?

677
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:19,644
I don't know, but I have an idea
of where to look for answers.

678
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:22,764
I lucid-dreamed.

679
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:25,274
I saw a woman
in a green hood.

680
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,772
She has to be the one
giving me premonitions.

681
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:29,149
Awesome.
You got it working.

682
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:30,605
- A-plus.
- B-minus.

683
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:32,899
Unless,

684
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:35,610
you tell us where
this green bitch went.

685
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:38,822
Well, in my dream,
I chased her to this stream

686
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:41,532
by the Fuchsia Forest
of Corian's Land.

687
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,288
(GASPS) Corian's Land,

688
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:45,620
also known as Sloth's Bane.

689
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:49,416
I don't know what everything
in my dreams means... Mean.

690
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:50,545
Anyway,

691
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:53,048
I know that the answers
to our questions...

692
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:55,471
Answers lie... Lay there?
(CHUCKLES)

693
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:58,891
I'm not usually the one who gives
the big speech, so I'm going.

694
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,969
So, that's happening.

695
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:12,859
KADY:
Gordy says, "You're welcome."

696
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:14,778
And he left you a bill.

697
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,027
That guy puts a really
high value on his time.

698
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,574
Wait, did I miss
the Baba Yaga?

699
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:25,827
Well, you snooze, you lose.

700
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:28,129
I wasn't snoozing,
I was dying.

701
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:29,626
We got bigger fish to fry.

702
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:32,633
I'll explain everything

703
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,802
as soon as your hedge witch
friends get here.

704
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:42,473
I know every instinct is
telling you not to trust me, or anyone.

705
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,604
But someone put a tracker
on this.

706
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:50,568
It's a complex, expensive,
very high-level spell.

707
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:57,821
It marked him.

708
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:01,142
It looks like the Deweys
you touched are doing the same to you.

709
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:04,332
If you have
any enchantments running,

710
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,645
anything you got
in a safe house,

711
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:07,706
anything home-brewed,
it could kill you,

712
00:34:07,796 --> 00:34:11,255
just like it did to Duke,
and almost did to Pete.

713
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:14,045
She saved my life.

714
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,920
I trust her,
and I vouch for her.

715
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,798
- Who did this?
- The Library.

716
00:34:20,934 --> 00:34:22,787
They make the Deweys,
and they don't give a shit

717
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:24,427
about what happens
to the hedges.

718
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:26,472
They're trying
to find someone,

719
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:29,478
and we're just
collateral damage.

720
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,851
So, ask yourselves,

721
00:34:31,945 --> 00:34:35,029
if this is what they do when they're not
even thinking about us,

722
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,399
what happens when they decide
we're a threat?

723
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:45,081
<i>Are we just gonna let people like them
tell us we're not important?</i>

724
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:52,167
<i>That we're just some side characters
in their fucked-up fascist plot?</i>

725
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,461
My mom was a hedge,

726
00:34:57,387 --> 00:35:00,004
and she was killed
by another hedge.

727
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,766
You'd think that would
turn me against you.

728
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,179
But it didn't.

729
00:35:08,982 --> 00:35:11,816
It just made me realize that
it doesn't have to be this way.

730
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:15,110
If we could stop screwing
each other over

731
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,404
long enough to work together,

732
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:20,073
then it's not
the Library's story.

733
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:23,320
It's our story.

734
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,456
- Hey.
- Hey.

735
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,458
I have a buddy in Modesto.

736
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:36,040
He says there's a leaky
Library pipe there.

737
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,842
I say we use it
to make those assholes pay.

you're going through...

739

They kill your boyfriend?

740
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:44,556
Actually, yeah.

741
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:49,178
Look, we'll figure out
what to do next.

742
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:50,513
I already know what to do.

743
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:53,850
You do that, you're giving them
a reason to wipe us out.

744
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:57,441
Please just get a little sleep.
We'll talk tomorrow.

Hey, you're not alone.

in a way that feels right for you.

Okay.

00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:08,990

- We have to go.
- Those things weren't her.

I can't just leave her.

It's not your fault.

Just unforeseen interaction.

781

Several hedges died.

782
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:43,045

to avoid having to hurt anyone.

- You can't blame yourself.

might provide a solution.
