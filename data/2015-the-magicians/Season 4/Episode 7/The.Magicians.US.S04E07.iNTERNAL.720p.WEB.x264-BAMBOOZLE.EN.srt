1
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:08,510
Previously,
on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,250
Look, just go while you
still have the chance.

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:16,010
The Library controls the
levels of ambient magic

4
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:17,120
that flow through the pipes.

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,030
This one has a leak.

6
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,100
Well, what's my
birthright, you scaly shit?

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,610
It's the talking animals.

8
00:00:25,611 --> 00:00:27,100
They've all been struck dumb.

9
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,070
So what is this?

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,100
I saved your fucking
life, bitch.

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,070
Margo, are you okay?

12
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,100
You're just a
brown-nose sweater boy

13
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,280
desperate to matter at all.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,090
The other me, Sam, did whatever

15
00:00:39,091 --> 00:00:41,280
she thought was right,
regardless of what

16
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,280
anybody else thought.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
This contract initiates

18
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,085
our services in exchange
for... - "Unlimited manual

19
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,150
and magical labor"?

20
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,250
"Bound in service to the Library

21
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:50,000
up to and after my death"?

22
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:50,280
Penny, where are you?

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,090
I'm in the Underworld Library.

24
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,030
If you stay down here,

25
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,140
you've got an amazing
destiny ahead of you.

26
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,150
Uh, excuse me?

27
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,210
Mr. Adiyodi?

28
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:23,620
Come in.

29
00:01:23,621 --> 00:01:25,010
Have a seat.

30
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:29,230
Is...
Did I do something wrong?

31
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:31,120
I called you in to talk
about Matilda Fremont.

32
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,135
You shelved her
book yesterday under

33
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:35,180
"Disappointing Prodigies"?

34
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,120
Oh, right.

35
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,605
Uh, mastered the flute at seven

36
00:01:38,606 --> 00:01:40,090
but became a mediocre poet.

37
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,180
Unremarkable.

38
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,120
Did you read her brother's book?

39
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,000
She saved his life...
Pulled him out

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,240
of a self-destructive spiral,

41
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,545
and he went on to become
one of the world's

42
00:01:49,546 --> 00:01:51,060
greatest philanthropists.

43
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,150
I wouldn't call
that "unremarkable."

44
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,060
Uh, okay.

45
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,040
So is there section for, uh,

46
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:59,020
"Sisters of Generous Men"?

47
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,170
You've been in the
Underworld branch,

48
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,140
um, three weeks?

49
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,180
- Well...
- Yeah, when I died, all I cared about

50
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,150
was getting back up
there, and... and all this?

51
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,115
I didn't think it mattered...
Where a book goes,

52
00:02:14,116 --> 00:02:16,070
who reads it.

53
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,210
- Those books I lent you,
- you get a chance to read them?

54
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:20,280
Of course.

55
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,120
Well, I skimmed.

56
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,220
How far did you get?

57
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,190
Alice, uh, opened a pipe,

58
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:28,000
accidentally helped blow
up the Modesto branch,

59
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,130
and Quentin played
Pictionary with a mummy.

60
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,190
Where would you file them?

61
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,640
Quentin and Alice...
"Star-Crossed Romances,"

62
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:39,170
probably,
or "Well-Meaning Failures."

63
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,210
What about the others?

64
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:44,190
Oh...
"Side Characters in Epic Quests."

65
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,220
I'm a side character?
- Look, no offense.

66
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,240
It's just... Quentin's the
center of the whole thing.

67
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,250
He's the one that
knows everybody.

68
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:56,220
He's the one the little
British girl picked to save the world.

69
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,120
Or he's the one
that looks like you.

70
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,050
Not fair.

71
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,250
Todd looks like me.
He's not the center of shit.

72
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,090
But he could be.

73
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,145
All I'm saying is you
think you've seen stories

74
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:11,240
like this before,
so you can guess

75
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,240
what's going to happen... 
who's important and who isn't.

76
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,250
But that's because you
are trapped in your POV.

77
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:20,170
You have a classic case
of White Male Protagonism,

78
00:03:20,171 --> 00:03:24,280
Derek, and a Librarian
simply can't have that.

79
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,210
But that's why these
books are so important.

80
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,000
They're such a gift.

81
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,090
They... they can allow you

82
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:33,180
to see other points of view.

83
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:36,030
And once you start seeing that,

84
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,590
you'll find that the story

85
00:03:37,591 --> 00:03:40,120
doesn't end the way you
think, and the most

86
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:43,060
important characters
aren't who you expect.

87
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,170
Remember back before
all the stuff in Modesto

88
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,060
when Alice first escaped
from the Library?

89
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,210
Oh, dear.

90
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:58,575
I'm telling you,
I saw a reindeer-driven sleigh

91
00:03:58,576 --> 00:04:00,120
fly away.

92
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:02,060
Alice and Nick are gone.

93
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,150
This is not funny.

94
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,060
I'm not laughing... now.

95
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,000
I mean...
Lets discuss next steps.

96
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,090
Mm, we should wait for Everett.

97
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,605
He'll know how to... -
Oh, he'll agree with me

98
00:04:12,606 --> 00:04:15,120
when I say that Alice
Quinn was your project.

99
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,615
Holding her here was a mistake.

100
00:04:16,616 --> 00:04:18,110
We aren't jailers.

101
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,060
What would you have done?

102
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:22,120
Alice broke her deal with us.

103
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,170
She tried to turn
off all of magic.

104
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,110
That has to have consequences.

105
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,585
Our mission is to preserve

106
00:04:27,586 --> 00:04:29,050
the knowledge of magic.

107
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,110
Alice Quinn is an
existential threat

108
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,260
to that knowledge.

109
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,720
Are you suggesting that

110
00:04:33,721 --> 00:04:37,170
we should have killed her...
And Santa Claus?

111
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,655
I'm so sorry.

112
00:04:40,656 --> 00:04:42,240
It's not at all funny.

113
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,150
Do you agree with Cyrus?

114
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,250
I see.

115
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:51,060
I admit,
I took a personal interest

116
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,270
in Alice's rehabilitation.

117
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,250
Perhaps it biased me.

118
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,060
You are correct.

119
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,040
We are not jailers.

120
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,070
Nor are we killers.

121
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,190
So I'll ask again... what
would you have us do?

122
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,170
"Protect the flame of knowledge

123
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,170
no matter the cost."

124
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,070
I believe that's how
the old motto goes.

125
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,120
Everett.

126
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,230
Sorry I was delayed.

127
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,190
The renovation of
our Rome branch

128
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,290
ran into some difficulties.

129
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,220
Have you been briefed on Alice?

130
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,080
I agree with Zelda.

131
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,140
We are an order of
scholars, not assassins.

132
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,100
So what is the
scholarly solution?

133
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,080
Read their books.

134
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,260
Learn their intentions.

135
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:32,010
We agreed not to breach
privacy unless there was

136
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,010
no other option.

137
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,090
What's the other option?

138
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,240
Uh, okay.

139
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,020
Well, Nick's book has been taken

140
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,180
and presumably destroyed,
but Alice's is still

141
00:05:42,181 --> 00:05:45,270
in the Revision Room
having the ending put in.

142
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,060
Which will take days,

143
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,120
and if she and Nick split
up, we'll lose them.

144
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,120
There might be another way.

145
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,100
Tracking devices.

146
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,250
Eventually,
they'll go somewhere for help.

147
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,290
There isn't enough ambient
to keep either of them

148
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,290
happy long,

149
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,130
so disperse a
Searcher widely and...

150
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,180
Disperse to whom, though?

151
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,140
I find it unlikely
that Alice or Nick

152
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,240
will run into the hands of
card-carrying Magicians.

153
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,635
They'll go underground.

154
00:06:08,636 --> 00:06:10,020
Yes.

155
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,180
Where the hedge witches are.

156
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,250
And the hedge
witches don't trust us.

157
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,000
We'll never get them to accept...

158
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,600
If we do what I'm
thinking, they'll take them

159
00:06:17,601 --> 00:06:19,100
without ever knowing.

160
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,180
Fine. Trackers.

161
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,135
And once Alice's book is
back, if we can verify

162
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:29,240
she's no longer a threat,
there'd be no need

163
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,240
for further corrective action.

164
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,100
Agreed?

165
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,180
All in favor?

166
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,250
Hmm.

167
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,040
You seem troubled.

168
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,250
Thank you, but I'm fine.

169
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:53,150
I understand.

170
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:56,190
I see something of
Harriet in Alice, too.

171
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,120
I wish you'd given
yourself some real time

172
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,000
to grieve your daughter.

173
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,125
Leave of absence, even.

174
00:07:01,126 --> 00:07:02,240
No, I'm...

175
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,230
Uh, I'm sorry.

176
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:16,000
Zelda.

177
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:19,200
I thought I heard something.

178
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,050
Excuse me, I have a meeting.

179
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:35,220
So you're telling me
the Head Librarian,

180
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,150
a member of the Governing
Council of the Order,

181
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,060
is having a nervous breakdown?

182
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,260
Trust me,
just 'cause she's seeing shit

183
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,120
that no one else sees
doesn't mean it isn't

184
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,180
really there.

185
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,260
- Uh, then we got to get
- a message to this Everett guy.

186
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,060
He's in charge, right?

187
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,070
Can't.

188
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,150
What do you mean?

189
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,250
There's a dragon that
connects the Underworld

190
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,250
to the Neitherlands.

191
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,270
We just take a note,
and we shove it up his...

192
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:59,010
Not how that works.

193
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,130
Look, being down here...
You mean being dead?

194
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,260
It gives you a new perspective.

195
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,180
There's shit we know
is going to happen

196
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,120
that people up there would
give anything to stop.

197
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,120
But we can see the
bigger picture.

198
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,180
It's not our job
to stop the living

199
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,000
from doing what they do.

200
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,200
It's our job to appreciate
their full life.

201
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,170
We see but do not intervene...

202
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,240
for a lot of good reasons.

203
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,130
I can see this is
wigging you out.

204
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:28,160
Let's start with an easier one.

205
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:31,230
Well, what's my
Birthright, you scaly shit?

206
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,020
Wait...
I read this one last week.

207
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:38,230
High King of Fillory gets mad

208
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:40,620
at, uh, the alpaca
lady, uh, to bring back

209
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:43,000
the talking animals' voices.

210
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,210
You read Margo's story.

211
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,270
This one is not about her.

212
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:50,020
Well, what's my
Birthright, you scaly shit?

213
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,140
Oh, hi, there.

214
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:57,030
Do you have a message, or...?

215
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,050
Oh!

216
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,070
Okay, it was a dream.

217
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,260
Just keep reading.

218
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:10,200
Well, what's my
Birthright, you scaly shit?

219
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,000
It's the talking animals.

220
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:17,200
They've all been struck dumb.

221
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:20,070
Well, shit.

222
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,160
All right, Fen,
I think I will do a ritual.

223
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:24,120
Earth specialty... the
Sleep of Solitude.

224
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,655
I pop an Ambien, everyone

225
00:09:25,656 --> 00:09:27,190
leaves me alone till noon.

226
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,210
That'll be perfect.

227
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,000
Rafe, last night I
had the strangest dream.

228
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
There were these bunnies
with their throats...

229
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,200
You know what?

230
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:42,230
I think I projected the
talking animals going mute.

231
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,200
Okay, I think I'm
starting to get the point

232
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,200
of these stories.

233
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,200
All women are just one
emotional crisis away

234
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,250
from a psychotic break.

235
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,000
Jesus, no.

236
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Whoa, you can't say
stuff like that anymore.

237
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,080
What, in the afterlife?

238
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,250
Anywhere.

239
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:00,200
Do you remember what Kady
was doing at this time?

240
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,210
Didn't she just
kind of peace out

241
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,250
after the Library
Dewey coin heist?

242
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,050
Not exactly.

243
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,160
See, while the others
were busy bleeding a stone

244
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:11,000
to stop the monster, Kady...

245
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,070
was busy doing something else.

246
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,030
Iris could have at least left us

247
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,050
a stone-bleeding
how-to or something.

248
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:21,000
Yeah,
I hear what you're saying, Q.

249
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,185
Hey.

250
00:10:23,186 --> 00:10:24,280
Don't mind me.

251
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:32,050
Uh, I'll go check
those other books.

252
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,070
The books in, uh,
Marina's library,

253
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,190
'cause, uh, yep,
that's got to be where they are.

254
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:41,070
Hey.

255
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,010
Haven't seen you in a while.

256
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,280
There was some
stuff I had to do.

257
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,040
Stuff I should be worried about?

258
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,260
I'm clean.

259
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:53,030
Good.

260
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,110
Who's this?

261
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,210
Five weeks ago,
her dad picked her up

262
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,000
from school and disappeared...

263
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,270
Custody fight with her mom.

264
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,100
Locator spell and a few
bruised knuckles later,

265
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:07,270
she's home.

266
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,200
"Five weeks ago"

267
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,040
as in when you were
"Detective Sam Cunningham"?

268
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,150
You're solving her
old case files?

269
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,270
All right, look...
you lived as Kim for months.

270
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,030
The moment you got your memory
back, you just...

271
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,190
You dropped it like
it never happened.

272
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,230
I-I can't.

273
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,170
I can't go back to
being a sidekick.

274
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,210
- You're not a sidekick.
- Come on.

275
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,070
I'm only in this group
at all because of Penny.

276
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,030
That's not true.

277
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,030
You and me... - We're
friends, yeah.

278
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,010
And then we weren't,
and now we're what...

279
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,240
I don't know,
whatever you call it when...

280
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,230
you have a lot of
history that made you

281
00:11:44,231 --> 00:11:46,210
two very different people.

282
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,110
I need my own path, Jules.

283
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,000
I want my life to feel
like it's about me.

284
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,270
No, I get that.

285
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,200
And I am all for
your personal growth.

286
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:59,120
It's just that we're... you
know, we're kind of

287
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,120
under the gun here.

288
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,600
You're under my roof,

289
00:12:00,601 --> 00:12:02,070
hidden from the McAllistairs

290
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,090
and the Library because I took

291
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,250
this place from Marina
when everyone else wanted

292
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,040
to hand her nuclear
launch codes.

293
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:14,000
Look, I'll help, of course...

294
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:17,250
when I can, in my way.

295
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,120
But for now...
Sam left a few loose ends

296
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,010
I need to tie up.

297
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,110
You're not my Postmate.

298
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,070
I am the Baba Yaga.

299
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,250
You live on my property
under my protection,

300
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,050
and your rent is due.

301
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:45,040
Okay, well,
this isn't exactly my place.

302
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,050
Well, you're here now,

303
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:50,090
and the list is clearly
posted on the premises.

304
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,000
Wait, Marina's weird
grocery list on the fridge?

305
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,070
It is not weird.

306
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,040
You are weird.

307
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:59,120
You reek of nondairy
creamer and despair.

308
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,090
Okay, look,
I don't have whatever it is

309
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,000
that you're looking for.

310
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,070
One Webster's Weeping Healer,

311
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,210
one Totem of the Plump Pelican,

312
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,220
and one Bag of Holding.

313
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:14,070
Pay what is owed
in two days' time

314
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,100
or wish I boiled you alive.

315
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:19,000
The wench will explain.

316
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,110
What?

317
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,250
Holy shit, you have to pay her.

318
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,080
- "Her"?
- You mean you.

319
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,250
Okay,
what the fuck is happening?

320
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,070
I'm Bailey.

321
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,120
Sorry about the Baba Yaga.

322
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:38,070
She can be a little...
The Baba's the spirit

323
00:13:38,071 --> 00:13:40,105
of a vengeful Slavic witch
I channel when I need

324
00:13:40,106 --> 00:13:43,040
to collect rent or deal
with a chatty Uber driver.

325
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,050
So if you don't want
to be her next meal,

326
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:46,270
you should give
her what she wants.

327
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,100
Ooh, stressful.

328
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:52,240
Where am I supposed
to find... Wait a minute.

329
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:57,000
Is the... The Totem
of the Plump Pelican.

330
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,000
Wait, this thing?

331
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,160
Oh, yeah, that's it.

332
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,225
Oh.

333
00:14:01,226 --> 00:14:02,280
Marina must have found it.

334
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,120
I just thought it was
some ugly paperweight.

335
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,080
Shh, don't insult it.

336
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,280
It reacts.

337
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,070
So two more to go.

338
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,280
Oh, shit.

339
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,020
She's coming back.

340
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,280
Pay me what is owed,

341
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,260
or I will boil your marrow into
soup, peasant.

342
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,090
See you Thursday.

343
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm looking for a
guy called "Lovelady."

344
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,110
Heard he has office hours here.

345
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,090
What is this?

346
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,160
Some kind of flashlight spell?

347
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:52,090
Isik.

348
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,170
- Jesus.
- Whoa!

349
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,050
Satisfied?

350
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,000
What the hell was that?

351
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,240
I never want to see the
floor of a bar that bright.

352
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,000
Pete?

353
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:11,270
Wait, you're Lovelady?

354
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,190
Oh, shit.

355
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,050
Kady.

356
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,250
It's been a while.

357
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,150
Last time I saw you,
you were with Marina.

358
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,280
Mm.

359
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,110
- We parted ways.
- It was mutual.

360
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,090
Mm, I'm sure.

361
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,160
So "Lovelady," huh?

362
00:15:27,161 --> 00:15:28,250
It's a title.

363
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,620
When one guy's done with
it, he passes it on

364
00:15:30,621 --> 00:15:32,000
to the next guy, kind of like

365
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,120
"Dread Pirate Roberts"

366
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:34,190
or "Senator."

367
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,160
That's not how Senators work.

368
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,130
Whatever.

369
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,155
The guy who was "Lovelady
before me is an Earl

370
00:15:42,156 --> 00:15:43,220
with a private island.

371
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,130
People respect the
shit out of me.

372
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,620
It's a great sign when

373
00:15:46,621 --> 00:15:48,100
you have to tell people that.

374
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:52,170
Did you come here
looking for my help or...?

375
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,280
Sorry.

376
00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:00,010
Here's a list.

377
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,190
I heard you can find things.

378
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,280
Interesting stuff.

379
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,270
Specific.

380
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,070
Landlord issue.

381
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,080
Have you considered moving?

382
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:11,020
The place has special features.

383
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,080
It just turns out it's
courtesy of a-a witch...

384
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:15,050
Uh, Baba-something.

385
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:16,270
You mean the Baba Yaga?

386
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,010
You know her?

387
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:20,120
Just by reputation.

388
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:24,180
Hey, if I help you,
in lieu of my usual fee,

389
00:16:24,181 --> 00:16:26,170
I want you to introduce me.

390
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:28,095
Not sure she's your type.

391
00:16:28,096 --> 00:16:30,000
She's got great taste.

392
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:34,090
This could open up a
whole new avenue for me.

393
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,270
Yeah, fine, whatever.

394
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,200
You'll help?

395
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,020
One more thing.

396
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:42,170
Um, do you still see Julia?

397
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,210
Don't be a creep, Pete.

398
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,200
Where are we going?

399
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,090
Black Market.

400
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,130
So Kady's moved on.

401
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:56,050
I mean, not with Pete, just...

402
00:16:56,070 --> 00:17:00,120
I know what you mean,
and I'm happy for her.

403
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:02,130
You don't look happy.

404
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,030
So is there some
sort of connection

405
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,100
I'm supposed to be
seeing between Kady,

406
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:12,140
Zelda, Fen... - You'll see.

407
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,100
Alice's book had been revised,

408
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:18,040
but Alice had
changed the ending.

409
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,050
Well?

410
00:17:19,051 --> 00:17:21,100
Apparently,
Alice feels magic has caused her

411
00:17:21,101 --> 00:17:22,140
nothing but trouble.

412
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,185
She goes on to live out
an entirely civilian life

413
00:17:24,186 --> 00:17:25,220
in Portland.

414
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:28,070
She just got a job
at a craft brewery,

415
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,220
and a Shih Tzu.

416
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,150
You look a little surprised.

417
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,150
Does that not sound like her?

418
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,090
The choice is unexpected, but...

419
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,650
wouldn't be the first time

420
00:17:37,651 --> 00:17:39,200
she walked away from magic.

421
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:41,150
Great, then.

422
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,230
Nick is still at large,
so we'll keep our trackers

423
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,180
in circulation,
but I think we can close

424
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,180
the book on Alice Quinn.

425
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:50,720
It's funny... I'd always thought

426
00:17:50,721 --> 00:17:52,190
she was a cat person.

427
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,145
Never seen her before.

428
00:17:55,146 --> 00:17:56,230
Sorry.

429
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,100
She would be a new hire.

430
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:01,160
We're not hiring right now.

431
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,150
In fact,
we've had to let some people go.

432
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:06,010
Designer hops are
getting expensive.

433
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:14,100
Well?

434
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:17,030
Alice is inside,
as her book said.

435
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,525
Hmm.

436
00:18:18,526 --> 00:18:20,010
Good riddance, book tart.

437
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,170
Let's go get some doughnuts.

438
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,200
This is the Black Market?

439
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,210
It's so... - Normal?

440
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,140
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

441
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:35,040
You'd be surprised what
you can find in here.

442
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,260
Even Deweys.

443
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:38,220
- Wait, I thought you had to
- have a Library card for that?

444
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:41,030
Yeah, well,
the Library should know better

445
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,070
than to give
unlimited black cards

446
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,120
to rich druggie dickbags
that trade them in

447
00:18:45,121 --> 00:18:46,150
for lap dances.

448
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,110
Oh, so you give lap dances, huh?

449
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:51,060
Selectively.

450
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:53,170
Okay, so that is Whitley.

451
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,050
If she does not have
a Bag of Holding,

452
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,200
she'll have a line on one.

453
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,260
What,
you're not gonna introduce me?

454
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:00,190
Well,
I may have had sex with her

455
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,020
and never called her again.

456
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,020
Classy.

457
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:07,130
Hey, I'm looking for
a Bag of Holding...

458
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,180
whatever that is.

459
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:11,180
- It's a "Doctor Who"
- kind of thing.

460
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:13,080
A bag that's bigger
on the inside.

461
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,070
Actually, it's a D&D thing.

462
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,180
Yeah, I don't do nerd shit.

463
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:19,620
Expensive taste for
someone who doesn't know

464
00:19:19,621 --> 00:19:21,190
what they're asking for.

465
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,130
I can pay.

466
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:28,130
Charisma Cufflinks...
for a Bag of Holding?

467
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,080
Come back when you're serious.

468
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:41,140
Kraken tentacles...
Helps build muscle.

469
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:43,050
I'm paleo.

470
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,230
Cavemen didn't eat kraken,
so I don't eat kraken.

471
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,130
What'll you give me for these?

472
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,110
Aleister Crowley's ashes.

473
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,090
- Mm-hmm.
- Not bad.

474
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,200
Worth a Bag of Holding?

475
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,250
Thanks.

476
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,090
What the hell, Pete?

477
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,070
I searched the whole
goddamn market for you.

478
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,080
Kady, great news.

479
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,090
I found Gordy.

480
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,100
Gordy's my, um... He's great.

481
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,150
Hi, Kaitlin.

482
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,200
Kady.

483
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:31,250
You were supposed to be
looking for the Webster's

484
00:20:31,251 --> 00:20:34,150
Weeping Whatever,
not getting wasted.

485
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,170
¿Por qué no los dos, mamacita?

486
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:40,080
I'll have you know
Gordy is a doctor.

487
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:42,250
- Well...
- For animals.

488
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,050
You know, for dogs and cats.

489
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,210
Don't sell yourself
short, all right?

490
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,250
- That's a real doctor.
- Ok... shh, shh, shh.

491
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,210
Not helpful.

492
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,250
Yes, helpful,
because Gordy knows

493
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:55,160
where to get that thing
that you're looking for.

494
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,650
The thing. The creepy doll

495
00:20:56,651 --> 00:20:58,130
that cries healing tears.

496
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,190
Webster's Weeping Healer.

497
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,210
Got a buddy,
Duke... exotic-bird guy.

498
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,070
So his cockatoo caught bumblefoot...
Okay, shh.

499
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,160
Duke has the doll?

500
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,000
Well, yeah.

501
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,270
Okay, where can I find him?

502
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,590
Hello?

503
00:21:17,591 --> 00:21:19,000
Anybody there?

504
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,130
I'm guessing no one's home.

505
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:34,130
Well, that explains it.

506
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,250
No sign of blunt-force trauma

507
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,150
or defensive wounds.

508
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,190
Doesn't look like foul play.

509
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,190
Okay, Mariska Hargitay.

510
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,230
Just find the doll, will you?

511
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:04,140
No, bad touch!

512
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,230
Get off!

513
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,140
God, I hate this place.

514
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:11,190
But... found the doll.

515
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,080
Ugh.

516
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,685
Healing tears or no,
I would not keep this thing

517
00:22:15,686 --> 00:22:17,140
in my house.

518
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:21,170
Really, Pete?

519
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,170
- What?
- He's not using it.

520
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,250
You're disgusting.

521
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:40,705
Oh, my God!

522
00:22:40,706 --> 00:22:42,160
Oh, my God.

523
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,210
Jesus, Fen!

524
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:51,000
Why the hell are you
lurking in a dark pantry?

525
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,160
Waiting for you.

526
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:54,240
- Your soufflé fell.
- You're gonna bake a new one.

527
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,140
- How did you...
- Dreamt it.

528
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,570
You're worried Margo is gonna

529
00:23:00,571 --> 00:23:02,140
blow talks with Lady Pike.

530
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:05,230
Wait,
again with the alpaca lady?

531
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,090
Sorry.

532
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,130
Uh, some of these
pages are out of order.

533
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,100
Just keep reading.

534
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,180
But really,
you're worried that you and she have

535
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,170
a true connection and
you're going to screw it up,

536
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,250
so you're stress-baking.

537
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,190
Okay, ouch.

538
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,160
And that's a weirdly
specific and accurate dream.

539
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:22,000
I also dreamt of
dancing ears of corn,

540
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:24,090
and then the farmers
reported a surplus.

541
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,010
I dreamt about what
Tick really does

542
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,200
with all those peaches he
steals from the kitchen,

543
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:29,260
which is surprisingly not gross.

544
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:32,110
And they've all come true.

545
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:35,150
Prophetic dreams could
mean a lot of things.

546
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,170
Uh, maybe you're a psychic

547
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:40,010
or someone cast some
kind of spell on you.

548
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:43,160
Or... or it's Fillory,
and maybe you just ate

549
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:43,160
some messed-up fruit.

550
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,170
You think someone
did this to me?

551
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,070
If you're worried,
next time it happens

552
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,140
just poke around
the dream a little.

553
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:50,150
Poke with what?

554
00:23:50,151 --> 00:23:51,150
A knife?

555
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,260
- No.
- No knives.

556
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:54,220
Lucid dreaming.

557
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,150
They teach it first
semester at Brakebills.

558
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,270
The second you realize
you're dreaming,

559
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,200
you can take control
of your dream.

560
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:01,000
You don't even need
magic to do it.

561
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:04,515
Just close your eyes...
Breathe, and try to push

562
00:24:04,516 --> 00:24:07,250
your finger through
your other hand.

563
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,150
Everything freezes.

564
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,230
Anything not
supposed to be there,

565
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,180
that's when you'll
be able to tell.

566
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,180
Alice wasn't where
her book said she'd be.

567
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:18,190
I suspect she sabotaged it.

568
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,230
And now I've lied
to my colleagues.

569
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,180
If I don't find her
before they find out...

570
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:27,220
Sounds like a personal problem.

571
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,090
Henry, please.

572
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,000
I'm trusting you.

573
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,000
What you mean is that you trust

574
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,190
that I won't report this
because it'd be worse

575
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,190
for Alice.

576
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,150
We both want to spare her that.

577
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,010
If you could just
tell me where she is...

578
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:46,280
I comply with every request...

579
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,150
All your red tape and
your triplicate bullshit.

580
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,565
This is your mess.

581
00:24:54,566 --> 00:24:56,130
Do not drag me into it.

582
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,270
Harriet?

583
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,250
I don't think an
ancient Slavic witch

584
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,140
is gonna want a mojito.

585
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:56,270
Right, um...
something vodka-based?

586
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,260
Are you actually nervous?

587
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:00,200
Baba Yaga's a really big deal

588
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:05,100
in my line of work, and...
First impressions...

589
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,670
What was I saying?

590
00:26:06,671 --> 00:26:08,230
Pete, your arm.

591
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:15,040
Ah... that molest-y
hand gave me the clap.

592
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:17,050
Oh, shit.

593
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,510
Looks like a bad
spell interaction.

594
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,240
- Something's clashing with one
- of his personal enchantments.

595
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,240
Which personal enchantment?

596
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,090
- I don't know.
- They're personal.

597
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,240
- Hedge spells, you know,
- they're off the street at best.

598
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,060
They got a lot of rough edges.

599
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,220
- There's really no telling
- if they'll play nice together

600
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:35,090
Until, well, they don't.

601
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:39,000
Whatever killed
Duke is killing him.

602
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,170
So help him,
or I break your jaw.

603
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,250
Look, the only human
diagnostic spell I know

604
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:44,640
costs magic, and I'm a little

605
00:26:44,641 --> 00:26:48,020
Dewey-light at the mo...
Please don't break my jaw.

606
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,230
Fine.

607
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,000
Pete has one he took
off your friend Duke.

608
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,595
Wait. Wait, you said

609
00:26:53,596 --> 00:26:55,180
something's clashing with Pete.

610
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,270
Mm-hmm.

611
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,650
Like what?

612
00:26:57,651 --> 00:26:59,020
Like a cursed object.

613
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:01,000
I once treated a
horse for strangles.

614
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:03,030
Turns out jockey's riding
crop interacted badly

615
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,210
with a hoof-protection
spell, so...

616
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,230
Does Pete carry a riding crop?

617
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,150
Okay, maybe just look at this.

618
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,050
Cobalt.

619
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,250
Don't touch that shit.

620
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,250
Not really planning to
now that you licked it.

621
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,170
- What?
- It's more accurate than lenses.

622
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,160
You can taste cobalt.

623
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,070
It's used in most
tracking spells.

624
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,220
- "Tracking spells"?
- Mm-hmm.

625
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:24,030
I put them on pets.

626
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,230
This one tastes like a
real expensive Searcher.

627
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,250
You hold it long enough,
it kind of sends out

628
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,190
a signal to whoever cast it.

629
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,060
Wait, a-a signal to wh... who?

630
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,260
Aliens.

631
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:35,280
I was thinking more
like who makes Deweys.

632
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,280
- The Library.
- Oh, yeah.

633
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,220
That makes more sense.

634
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:41,280
Who's the Library looking for?

635
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,250
Oh, I can think of a few people.

636
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,730
Wait, how many hedges have

637
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:46,200
these personal enchantments?

638
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:48,220
Pretty much everybody.

639
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,020
Shit.

640
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:52,040
Take off all of Pete's, now.

641
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,250
What are you gonna do?

642
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,200
I'm gonna warn everybody.

643
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,250
Wait a second.

644
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,745
So the Library's responsible

645
00:27:57,746 --> 00:27:59,230
for hedge witches dying?

646
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,230
Yeah,
but they don't know that yet.

647
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,150
Spoiler alert.

648
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,180
- Zelda had some other things
- on her mind at the time.

649
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,020
Her dead daughter.

650
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:10,070
Wait, is she, like, down here?

651
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,020
I thought you
didn't like spoilers.

652
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:16,230
Look, I'm sorry you see dead
people, but that is

653
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,230
an incredibly stupid idea.

654
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,250
She's not dead.

655
00:28:17,251 --> 00:28:18,260
Ghosts don't bleed.

656
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:20,270
I don't know how,
but she could be alive

657
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,060
stuck in there.

658
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:24,050
That's insane...
And impossible.

659
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,190
It's the Mirror Realm.

660
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,080
We don't know what's impossible.

661
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:30,080
It's not as complicated
as a mirror bridge.

662
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:32,210
- We just need to open a door
- to the place between mirrors.

663
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,080
Listen, Zelds,
if you told me you wanted

664
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:36,000
to finger-paint your blood
so you could take a walk

665
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:38,220
in the crazy dimension I would
say, "Free country."

666
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:41,020
But this is my blood.

667
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:44,240
I can't do this...
without your help.

668
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,050
Yes, I know that.

669
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,080
And I'm leaving.

670
00:28:47,081 --> 00:28:48,100
She's my daughter.

671
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,250
Harriet...
who's older than you?

672
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:58,020
Our relationship is complicated.

673
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,220
Clearly.

674
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:02,000
You smashed the mirror.

675
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,040
You... trapped her there.

676
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,110
I was doing my job.

677
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:09,230
I can't...
Live with myself if I don't

678
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:13,070
find a way to help her.

679
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:18,220
Please.

680
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:23,270
Christ.

681
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,260
I'm gonna regret this, aren't I?

682
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,590
Did you juice the beets?

683
00:29:30,591 --> 00:29:32,180
Oh, I juiced the beets.

684
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:34,000
I told you I would
juice the beets.

685
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,550
Why wouldn't I juice the beets?

686
00:29:35,551 --> 00:29:37,100
Don't make this about us.

687
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:39,000
Wait, did I miss something?

688
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:41,740
I thought Margo and
Josh were an unlikely

689
00:29:41,741 --> 00:29:43,200
yet heartwarming thing.

690
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:46,020
No, this is after
the Lady Pike incident.

691
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:48,230
Margo called Josh a sweater boy.

692
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,000
Forget it.

693
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,180
Pay attention to Fen.

694
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:53,100
How's this shit work?

695
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:57,200
Pour it gently onto the
lizard, Your Majesty.

696
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:11,050
Jesus lizard-fucking Christ!

697
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:17,520
Does this feel like
a weird sort of dream

698
00:30:17,521 --> 00:30:19,040
to any of you?

699
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,100
All right,
maybe I can control this.

700
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,270
Ember's balls.

701
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,090
This is a dream.

702
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,080
Okay, okay. Stop talking to

703
00:30:38,081 --> 00:30:40,060
yourself and, uh, look around.

704
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,250
Hey!

705
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,220
Who are you?

706
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,240
Wait, no!

707
00:30:45,241 --> 00:30:46,250
Stop, please!

708
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:48,090
- Freeze!
- Freeze!

709
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:50,050
Hey, hey, stop!

710
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,270
- Freeze!
- Green Lady!

711
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,000
Hold up!

712
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,250
Hey, Green Lady, come back!

713
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,220
Umber's ass,
this is getting annoying.

714
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:14,060
Hey, wait!

715
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,280
Wait, I just want to talk!

716
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,030
Why am I having
these stupid dreams?

717
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,240
Oh, no.

718
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:21,100
The lizard.

719
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:24,050
You pour it gently onto the
lizard, Your Majesty.

720
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:26,030
- Wait, stop!
- It'll catch fire!

721
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,210
The fuck?

722
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:34,240
I saw the lizard blow up when Rafe...
Antidote.

723
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:36,240
What is she talking about?

724
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:38,080
Perhaps she's mad with grief

725
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:40,240
over the loss of King
Eliot, Your Majesty.

726
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:42,060
I assure you, all the animals

727
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:44,220
have responded quite
positively to the antidote.

728
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:47,010
Well, this one definitely won't.

729
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,130
Foosh.

730
00:31:48,131 --> 00:31:49,240
Fried Lizard.

731
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:52,080
And where are you
getting this information?

732
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:59,090
I... I dreamt it.

733
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:02,220
Fen has been having
kind of prophetic dreams.

734
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:04,010
She knew my soufflé
was gonna fall

735
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,110
before that ever happened.

736
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:07,010
It's a stupid
fucking premonition.

737
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,040
You want to risk the
life of your lizard,

738
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,140
or is that a relationship

739
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:10,260
you're willing to
set fire to as well?

740
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:12,110
Oh,
I'll fucking fry this lizard.

741
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,010
Okay, can we... can we
focus for one minute?

742
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:14,240
- Sure.
- Yes.

743
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,090
- Fine.
- Let's.

744
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,100
- Cool.
- Great.

745
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:19,070
Okay.

746
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,070
Say I don't dose Newt
Scamander with beet juice.

747
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,590
How the shit am I supposed

748
00:32:23,591 --> 00:32:25,100
to get his wrinkly ass talking?

749
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,060
I don't know, but I have an idea

750
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,050
of where to look for answers.

751
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,280
I lucid-dreamed.

752
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,020
I saw a woman in a green hood.

753
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:36,100
She has to be the one
giving me premonitions.

754
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,270
- Awesome.
- You got it working.

755
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,645
A-plus.

756
00:32:38,646 --> 00:32:40,010
B-minus.

757
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:44,100
Unless... you tell us where
this green bitch went.

758
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:47,160
Well, in my dream,
I chased her to this stream

759
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:50,070
by the Fuschia Forest
of Corian's Land.

760
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:55,030
Corian's Land...
also known as Sloth's Bane.

761
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,520
I don't know what everything

762
00:32:56,521 --> 00:32:58,000
in my dreams means... mean.

763
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,280
Anyway, I know that the answers

764
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,080
to our questions...
Answers lie... lay there?

765
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:06,090
I-I'm not usually the one
who gives the big speech,

766
00:33:06,091 --> 00:33:10,160
so I'm... I'm going.
So that... that's happening.

767
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:23,000
Gordy says "you're welcome."

768
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:25,040
And he left you a bill.

769
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:28,170
That guy puts a really
high value on his time.

770
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:33,110
Wait, did I miss the Baba Yaga?

771
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:35,180
Well, you snooze, you lose.

772
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:38,000
I wasn't snoozing, I was dying.

773
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:40,210
We got bigger fish to fry.

774
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:43,570
I'll explain everything as
soon as your hedge witch

775
00:33:43,571 --> 00:33:45,010
friends get here.

776
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,260
I know every
instinct is telling you

777
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:52,210
not to trust me... or anyone.

778
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:56,000
But someone put a
tracker on this.

779
00:33:56,010 --> 00:34:00,200
It's a complex, expensive,
very high-level spell.

780
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,130
It marked him.

781
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,280
It looks like the
Deweys you touched

782
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,010
are doing the same to you.

783
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:14,050
If you have any
enchantments running...

784
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:15,190
Anything you got
in a safe house,

785
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,130
anything homebrewed...
It could kill you...

786
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:21,000
just like it did to Duke
and almost did to Pete.

787
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:24,130
She saved my life.

788
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:26,210
I trust her,
and I vouch for her.

789
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:28,170
Who did this?

790
00:34:28,171 --> 00:34:30,130
The Library.

791
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:32,090
They make the Deweys,
and they don't give a shit

792
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:34,190
about what happens
to the hedges.

793
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:38,150
They're trying to find
someone, and we're just

794
00:34:38,151 --> 00:34:39,170
collateral damage.

795
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:42,150
So ask yourselves... if
this is what they do

796
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:45,150
when they're not even
thinking about us,

797
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:48,150
what happens when they
decide we're a threat?

798
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,170
Are we just gonna
let people like them

799
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:55,210
tell us we're not important?

800
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:59,190
That we're just
some side characters

801
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:03,150
in their fucked-up fascist plot?

802
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:07,050
My mom was a hedge...
and she was killed

803
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:11,010
by another hedge.

804
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:13,210
You'd think that would
turn me against you.

805
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:18,190
But it didn't.

806
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:20,170
It just made me realize that

807
00:35:20,171 --> 00:35:22,130
it doesn't have to be this way.

808
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:25,000
If we could stop
screwing each other over

809
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:28,660
long enough to work
together, then it's not

810
00:35:28,661 --> 00:35:30,230
the Library's story.

811
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:33,190
It's our story.

812
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,070
Hey.

813
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:43,070
I have a buddy in Modesto.

814
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:46,030
He says there's a leaky
Library pipe there.

815
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:49,070
I say we use it to make
those assholes pay.

816
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:50,170
Look, I know what
you're going through...

817
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:51,620
Do you?

818
00:35:51,621 --> 00:35:53,070
They kill your boyfriend?

819
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,230
Actually, yeah.

820
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:59,010
Look, we'll figure
out what to do next.

821
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,110
I already know what to do.

822
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:02,150
You do that,
you're giving them a reason

823
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:04,090
to wipe us out.

824
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:06,045
Please just get a little sleep.

825
00:36:06,046 --> 00:36:08,000
We'll talk tomorrow.

826
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:10,210
Hey, you're not alone, okay?

827
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:12,070
We'll figure this out together

828
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,390
in a way that feels
right for you.

829
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:17,110
Okay.

830
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:19,090
Yeah, we can do that.

831
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:35,170
It's a copy of our
library, but wrong.

832
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,030
I was gonna say
a total mindfuck.

833
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:42,090
Tomato, tomah-to.

834
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,130
Oh, you go on.

835
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,190
I'll just be here cutting myself

836
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,130
to keep our bloody exit open.

837
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,230
Hey, just made a joke.

838
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:04,170
Hello?

839
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,190
Where have you been?

840
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:53,680
Your funhouse-mirror daughter

841
00:38:53,681 --> 00:38:55,150
shanked me. We have to go.

842
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:57,110
Those things weren't her.

843
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:58,210
The real Harriet could
still be in here.

844
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,000
I can't just leave her.

845
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,230
I hate to break it to
you, love...

846
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:03,550
- She might still be in there,
- but so are those monsters.

847
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:26,090
An attack?

848
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:27,150
On what branch?

849
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:30,090
Modesto, California.

850
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:32,230
We lost four Librarians.

851
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:34,150
Hedge witches did it.

852
00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:36,090
But... but why?

853
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:43,070
There was some fallout
from your tracker coins.

854
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:45,150
It's not your fault.

855
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:47,190
Just unforeseen interaction.

856
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:49,250
Several hedges died.

857
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:52,700
The whole point of doing
this was to avoid having

858
00:39:52,701 --> 00:39:54,210
to hurt anyone.

859
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:56,150
I should have been here.

860
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:58,050
You can't blame yourself.

861
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,600
If anything, today we learned

862
00:39:59,601 --> 00:40:02,630
the true danger we're in
and that your trackers

863
00:40:02,631 --> 00:40:04,130
might provide a solution.

864
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,250
What do you mean?

865
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:12,070
Complications aside...
the idea is sound.

866
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:16,090
Put whatever we have into
circulation among them.

867
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:19,210
We keep Modesto from
happening again.

868
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:22,260
Are you suggesting
we kill hedge witches?

869
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:25,110
I am suggesting that
we keep an eye on them.

870
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:26,280
To "protect the
flame of knowledge

871
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:30,190
from ever being extinguished,
no matter the cost."

872
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:35,010
I don't know what to say.

873
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:41,110
This is an awesome
responsibility.

874
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:43,170
You and I both know that,
but who is better suited

875
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:47,070
to bear that responsibility
than The Order?

876
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,190
There is no one I
trust more deeply

877
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:54,260
to be fair and right than you.

878
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:59,230
[knocking on door, door opens]

879
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:03,170
Alice.

880
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,150
I can't stay long.

881
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,150
I-I cast a spell to keep

882
00:41:06,151 --> 00:41:10,110
the Library from eavesdropping,
but it won't last.

883
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:12,030
I need your help.

884
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:14,130
They have my friend Sheila.

885
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:16,150
I know.

886
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,230
Hello, Ms. Quinn.

887
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,190
Alice, please.

888
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:24,280
Nothing will happen to you here.

889
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:28,070
Zelda wants to talk.

890
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:29,150
Why?

891
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,230
I need your help.

892
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:37,150
I think I've seen enough.

893
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:38,700
To counteract a lifetime

894
00:41:38,701 --> 00:41:40,230
of cis-het frat-bro bias?

895
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:42,230
I-I doubt it.

896
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:44,130
Okay.

897
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:46,230
So tell me, what was I
supposed to take from that?

898
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,670
Zelda doesn't know it yet,

899
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:50,160
but what she just set in
motion is going to change

900
00:41:50,161 --> 00:41:51,210
the Library forever.

901
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:57,130
Same with Fen and Fillory,
Kady and all of magic.

902
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:59,150
When you file people
away as sidekicks,

903
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:02,090
you don't realize their
importance to the story,

904
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:05,650
and this story belongs
to a lot more people

905
00:42:05,651 --> 00:42:07,130
than you think.

906
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:11,090
Where to shelve a book,
it's not a little thing.

907
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:13,210
You're telling the
world what to value,

908
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:17,130
who to value.

909
00:42:17,150 --> 00:42:19,280
You get our responsibility here?

910
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,250
Well said.

911
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:24,150
I think you've earned
the right to move up.

912
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:27,230
Excuse me?

913
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:31,110
I know so much about
you and your friends,

914
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:34,190
but you never asked
me how I died.

915
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,505
O-okay, um... How did you die?

916
00:42:39,506 --> 00:42:42,190
Arrow to the chest...
during the Crusades.

917
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:43,250
"The Crusades"?

918
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,260
1,000 years ago?

919
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,150
We really thought the story

920
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:50,190
was all about white guys back
then, believe me.

921
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:53,150
And I'm not new at all.

922
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:57,150
I'm actually your
supervisor's supervisor.

923
00:42:57,170 --> 00:43:00,010
So you're my boss.

924
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:02,170
I fully see the
irony of a white guy

925
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:05,010
giving you this test,
but ladies upstairs

926
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:07,030
love a twist,
so they always send me.

927
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:08,210
Send you to what?

928
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:10,150
To promote you.

929
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:13,010
You're clearly ready
for the next level.

930
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:14,150
Which is?

931
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:16,170
Secrets Taken to the Grave.

932
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:18,230
You're gonna collect them.

933
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:21,280
Congratulations.

934
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,050
Thank you.

935
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:27,210
Oh, and, um, I'm afraid we're gonna 
need you to start right away.

936
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:48,070
Hey.

937
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:50,050
Been a while.

938
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:54,030
Welcome to the Underworld.
