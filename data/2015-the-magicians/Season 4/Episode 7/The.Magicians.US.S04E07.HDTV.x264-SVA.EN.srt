1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:01,956
Previously, on
<i>"The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:02,266 --> 00:00:04,446
Look, just go while you still
have the chance.

3
00:00:05,633 --> 00:00:09,383
The Library controls
the levels of ambient magic

4
00:00:09,383 --> 00:00:12,403
that flow through the pipes.
This one has a leak.

5
00:00:14,423 --> 00:00:17,473
Well, what's my Birthright,
you scaly shit?

6
00:00:17,493 --> 00:00:20,473
It's the talking animals.
They've all been struck dumb.

7
00:00:20,473 --> 00:00:21,443
So what is this?

8
00:00:21,453 --> 00:00:23,473
I saved your
fucking life, bitch.

9
00:00:23,473 --> 00:00:26,443
Margo, are you okay?

10
00:00:26,463 --> 00:00:30,187
You're just a brown-nose sweater
boy desperate to matter at all.

11
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,142
The other me, Sam,
did whatever she thought was right,

12
00:00:33,143 --> 00:00:34,865
regardless of what anybody else thought.

13
00:00:34,873 --> 00:00:37,373
This contract initiates
our services in exchange for...

14
00:00:37,393 --> 00:00:39,523
"Unlimited manual and magical labor"?

15
00:00:39,543 --> 00:00:43,114
"Bound in service to the Library
up to and after my death"?

16
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:45,463
- Penny, where are you?
- I'm in the Underworld Library.

17
00:00:45,473 --> 00:00:49,513
If you stay down here, you've got
an amazing destiny ahead of you.

18
00:01:13,383 --> 00:01:14,523
Uh, excuse me?

19
00:01:14,523 --> 00:01:18,383
- Mr. Adiyodi?
- Come in. Have a seat.

20
00:01:18,383 --> 00:01:21,433
Is...

21
00:01:21,433 --> 00:01:22,603
Did I do something wrong?

22
00:01:22,603 --> 00:01:24,493
I called you in to talk
about Matilda Fremont.

23
00:01:24,493 --> 00:01:28,553
You shelved her book yesterday
under "Disappointing Prodigies"?

24
00:01:28,553 --> 00:01:30,493
Oh, right.

25
00:01:30,493 --> 00:01:33,463
Uh, mastered the flute at seven
but became a mediocre poet.

26
00:01:33,473 --> 00:01:34,553
Unremarkable.

27
00:01:34,573 --> 00:01:36,493
Did you read her brother's book?

28
00:01:36,493 --> 00:01:37,923
She saved his life...

29
00:01:37,924 --> 00:01:41,684
Pulled him out of a self-destructive
spiral, and he went on to become

30
00:01:41,686 --> 00:01:44,716
one of the world's
greatest philanthropists.

31
00:01:44,726 --> 00:01:46,806
I wouldn't call that
"unremarkable."

32
00:01:46,826 --> 00:01:52,676
Uh, okay. So is there section for,
uh, "Sisters of Generous Men"?

33
00:01:53,776 --> 00:01:55,826
You've been
in the Underworld branch,

34
00:01:55,836 --> 00:01:57,796
um, three weeks?
Well...

35
00:01:57,806 --> 00:01:59,836
Yeah, when I died,
all I cared about

36
00:01:59,836 --> 00:02:03,806
was getting back up there,
and... and all this?

37
00:02:03,816 --> 00:02:05,806
I didn't think it mattered...

38
00:02:05,816 --> 00:02:09,726
Where a book goes, who reads it.

39
00:02:09,746 --> 00:02:12,150
Those books I lent you,
you get a chance to read them?

40
00:02:12,151 --> 00:02:13,936
Of course.

41
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,776
Well, I skimmed.

42
00:02:15,776 --> 00:02:16,876
How far did you get?

43
00:02:16,896 --> 00:02:18,846
Alice, uh, opened a pipe,

44
00:02:18,866 --> 00:02:21,656
accidentally helped blow up
the Modesto branch,

45
00:02:21,676 --> 00:02:24,786
and Quentin played Pictionary
with a mummy.

46
00:02:25,776 --> 00:02:26,846
Where would you file them?

47
00:02:26,866 --> 00:02:27,896
Quentin and Alice...

48
00:02:27,906 --> 00:02:30,686
"Star-Crossed Romances,"
probably,

49
00:02:30,686 --> 00:02:32,826
or "Well-Meaning Failures."

50
00:02:32,836 --> 00:02:34,866
- What about the others?
- Oh...

51
00:02:34,876 --> 00:02:37,846
"Side Characters in Epic Quests."

52
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,716
I'm a side character?

53
00:02:39,836 --> 00:02:40,986
Look, no offense.

54
00:02:41,006 --> 00:02:44,006
It's just... Quentin's the
center of the whole thing.

55
00:02:44,016 --> 00:02:46,016
He's the one
that knows everybody.

56
00:02:46,036 --> 00:02:49,986
He's the one the little British
girl picked to save the world.

57
00:02:50,006 --> 00:02:52,886
Or he's the one
that looks like you.

58
00:02:52,896 --> 00:02:57,016
Not fair. Todd looks like me.
He's not the center of shit.

59
00:02:57,036 --> 00:02:59,856
But he could be.

60
00:02:59,876 --> 00:03:00,916
All I'm saying is you think

61
00:03:00,926 --> 00:03:02,896
you've seen stories
like this before,

62
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,006
so you can guess
what's going to happen...

63
00:03:05,016 --> 00:03:08,006
Who's important and who isn't.

64
00:03:08,016 --> 00:03:11,016
But that's because you are
trapped in your POV.

65
00:03:11,036 --> 00:03:14,986
You have a classic case of
White Male Protagonism, Derek,

66
00:03:15,006 --> 00:03:20,976
and a Librarian simply can't have that. But
that's why these books are so important.

67
00:03:20,976 --> 00:03:26,946
They're such a gift. They... they can
allow you to see other points of view.

68
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,604
And once you start seeing that,

69
00:03:29,605 --> 00:03:32,685
you'll find that the story
doesn't end the way you think,

70
00:03:32,705 --> 00:03:36,615
and the most important
characters aren't who you expect.

71
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,725
Remember back before
all the stuff in Modesto

72
00:03:43,735 --> 00:03:47,615
when Alice first escaped
from the Library?

73
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:48,765
Oh, dear.

74
00:03:48,765 --> 00:03:53,675
I'm telling you,
I saw a reindeer-driven sleigh fly away.

75
00:03:53,685 --> 00:03:55,615
Alice and Nick are gone.

76
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:56,705
This is not funny.

77
00:03:56,705 --> 00:04:00,615
I'm not laughing... now.

78
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,555
I mean...
Lets discuss next steps.

79
00:04:02,555 --> 00:04:04,777
Mm, we should wait for Everett.
He'll know how to...

80
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:05,868
Oh, he'll agree with me
when I say

81
00:04:05,868 --> 00:04:07,838
that Alice Quinn
was your project.

82
00:04:07,838 --> 00:04:10,828
Holding her here was a mistake.
We aren't jailers.

83
00:04:10,838 --> 00:04:12,778
What would you have done?

84
00:04:12,788 --> 00:04:14,838
Alice broke her deal with us.

85
00:04:14,848 --> 00:04:18,828
She tried to turn off all of magic.
That has to have consequences.

86
00:04:20,158 --> 00:04:22,758
Our mission is to preserve
the knowledge of magic.

87
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:25,959
Alice Quinn is an existential
threat to that knowledge.

88
00:04:25,969 --> 00:04:28,869
Are you suggesting that
we should have killed her...

89
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:30,869
And Santa Claus?

90
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:35,939
I'm so sorry.
It's not at all funny.

91
00:04:35,949 --> 00:04:38,849
Do you agree with Cyrus?

92
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:41,949
I see.

93
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:46,969
I admit, I took a personal
interest in Alice's rehabilitation.

94
00:04:46,989 --> 00:04:48,949
Perhaps it biased me.

95
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,759
You are correct.

96
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:52,739
We are not jailers.

97
00:04:52,749 --> 00:04:54,769
Nor are we killers.

98
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:57,889
So I'll ask again...
What would you have us do?

99
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:01,869
"Protect the flame of knowledge
no matter the cost."

100
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:04,480
I believe that's
how the old motto goes.

101
00:05:04,481 --> 00:05:05,521
Everett.

102
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:06,631
Sorry I was delayed.

103
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:10,401
The renovation of our Rome branch
ran into some difficulties.

104
00:05:10,402 --> 00:05:13,482
- Have you been briefed on Alice?
- I agree with Zelda.

105
00:05:13,502 --> 00:05:16,542
We are an order of scholars,
not assassins.

106
00:05:16,562 --> 00:05:19,502
So what is
the scholarly solution?

107
00:05:19,512 --> 00:05:22,150
Read their books.
Learn their intentions.

108
00:05:22,151 --> 00:05:25,311
We agreed not to breach privacy
unless there was no other option.

109
00:05:25,312 --> 00:05:27,382
What's the other option?

110
00:05:29,392 --> 00:05:30,532
Uh, okay.

111
00:05:30,542 --> 00:05:35,279
Well, Nick's book has been
taken and presumably destroyed,

112
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,562
but Alice's is still in the Revision Room
having the ending put in.

113
00:05:38,582 --> 00:05:42,412
Which will take days, and if she
and Nick split up, we'll lose them.

114
00:05:42,422 --> 00:05:44,412
There might be another way.

115
00:05:44,422 --> 00:05:46,392
Tracking devices.

116
00:05:47,024 --> 00:05:49,164
Eventually, they'll go
somewhere for help.

117
00:05:49,164 --> 00:05:52,299
There isn't enough ambient to
keep either of them happy long,

118
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,480
- so disperse a Searcher widely and...
- Disperse to whom, though?

119
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,260
I find it unlikely that
Alice or Nick will run into

120
00:05:59,261 --> 00:06:01,140
the hands of
card-carrying Magicians.

121
00:06:01,141 --> 00:06:03,320
- They'll go underground.
- Yes.

122
00:06:03,761 --> 00:06:06,971
- Where the hedge witches are.
- And the hedge witches don't trust us.

123
00:06:06,971 --> 00:06:09,801
- We'll never get them to accept...
- If we do what I'm thinking,

124
00:06:09,821 --> 00:06:12,821
they'll take them
without ever knowing.

125
00:06:14,442 --> 00:06:16,622
Fine. Trackers.

126
00:06:16,632 --> 00:06:18,572
And once Alice's book is back,

127
00:06:18,582 --> 00:06:20,572
if we can verify
she's no longer a threat,

128
00:06:20,582 --> 00:06:22,682
there'd be no need
for further corrective action.

129
00:06:22,692 --> 00:06:24,542
Agreed?

130
00:06:28,442 --> 00:06:29,622
All in favor?

131
00:06:35,642 --> 00:06:37,692
Hmm.

132
00:06:37,702 --> 00:06:43,692
- You seem troubled.
- Thank you, but I'm fine.

133
00:06:43,692 --> 00:06:46,592
I understand.

134
00:06:46,612 --> 00:06:49,632
I see something of Harriet
in Alice, too.

135
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:53,442
I wish you'd given yourself some
real time to grieve your daughter.

136
00:06:53,452 --> 00:06:57,442
- Leave of absence, even.
- No, I'm...

137
00:07:00,912 --> 00:07:01,922
Uh, I'm sorry.

138
00:07:06,982 --> 00:07:09,692
Zelda.

139
00:07:09,702 --> 00:07:12,892
I thought I heard something.

140
00:07:12,912 --> 00:07:15,742
Excuse me, I have a meeting.

141
00:07:23,037 --> 00:07:27,800
<font color="#00FFFF">Synced & corrected by</font> <font color="#D81D1D">MaxPayne</font>
== <font color="#138CE9">https://</font>subscene<font color="#138CE9">.com</font> ==

142
00:07:27,872 --> 00:07:30,702
So you're telling me
the Head Librarian,

143
00:07:30,712 --> 00:07:32,842
a member of the
Governing Council of the Order,

144
00:07:32,862 --> 00:07:34,752
is having a nervous breakdown?

145
00:07:34,752 --> 00:07:37,319
Trust me, just 'cause she's
seeing shit that no one else sees

146
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,880
doesn't mean
it isn't really there.

147
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,960
Uh, then we got to get
a message to this Everett guy.

148
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,770
- He's in charge, right?
- Can't.

149
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,696
What do you mean?

150
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:47,250
There's a dragon that connects
the Underworld to the Neitherlands.

151
00:07:47,251 --> 00:07:49,261
We just take a note,
and we shove it up his...

152
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:52,730
Not how that works.

153
00:07:52,734 --> 00:07:53,884
Look, being down here...

154
00:07:53,894 --> 00:07:55,844
You mean being dead?

155
00:07:55,854 --> 00:07:57,974
It gives you a new perspective.

156
00:07:57,984 --> 00:07:59,894
There's shit we know
is going to happen

157
00:07:59,894 --> 00:08:02,834
that people up there would
give anything to stop.

158
00:08:02,834 --> 00:08:04,834
But we can see
the bigger picture.

159
00:08:04,844 --> 00:08:08,303
It's not our job to stop the
living from doing what they do.

160
00:08:08,304 --> 00:08:14,474
It's our job to appreciate their full life.
We see but do not intervene...

161
00:08:14,484 --> 00:08:16,544
for a lot of good reasons.

162
00:08:16,554 --> 00:08:21,464
I can see this is wigging you out.
Let's start with an easier one.

163
00:08:21,774 --> 00:08:24,784
Well, what's my Birthright,
you scaly shit?

164
00:08:24,794 --> 00:08:26,724
Wait...

165
00:08:26,744 --> 00:08:28,574
I read this one last week.

166
00:08:28,584 --> 00:08:31,784
High King of Fillory gets mad
at, uh, the alpaca lady,

167
00:08:31,794 --> 00:08:36,554
uh, to bring back
the talking animals' voices.

168
00:08:36,564 --> 00:08:37,764
You read Margo's story.

169
00:08:37,774 --> 00:08:39,824
This one is not about her.

170
00:08:39,834 --> 00:08:43,574
Well, what's my Birthright,
you scaly shit?

171
00:08:45,754 --> 00:08:47,694
Oh, hi, there.

172
00:08:47,704 --> 00:08:50,584
Do you have a message, or...?

173
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,604
Oh!

174
00:08:56,624 --> 00:08:58,624
Okay, it was a dream.

175
00:08:58,634 --> 00:08:59,814
Just keep reading.

176
00:08:59,824 --> 00:09:03,754
Well, what's my Birthright,
you scaly shit?

177
00:09:05,594 --> 00:09:07,554
It's the talking animals.

178
00:09:07,564 --> 00:09:10,754
They've all been struck dumb.

179
00:09:10,764 --> 00:09:13,624
Well, shit.

180
00:09:13,634 --> 00:09:16,263
All right, Fen, I think
I will do a ritual.

181
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,214
Earth specialty...
The Sleep of Solitude.

182
00:09:18,214 --> 00:09:23,304
I pop an Ambien, everyone leaves me
alone till noon. That'll be perfect.

183
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:28,629
Rafe, last night I had
the strangest dream.

184
00:09:28,629 --> 00:09:31,629
There were these bunnies
with their throats...

185
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:32,829
You know what?

186
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,859
I think I projected
the talking animals going mute.

187
00:09:35,869 --> 00:09:38,829
Okay, I think I'm starting to
get the point of these stories.

188
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:40,829
All women are just one
emotional crisis away

189
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:41,879
from a psychotic break.

190
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:43,629
Jesus, no.

191
00:09:43,629 --> 00:09:46,629
Whoa, you can't say stuff
like that anymore.

192
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:49,879
- What, in the afterlife?
- Anywhere.

193
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:53,829
Do you remember what Kady
was doing at this time?

194
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,879
Didn't she just kind of peace out
after the Library Dewey coin heist?

195
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:01,780
Not exactly. See, while the
others were busy bleeding a stone

196
00:10:01,781 --> 00:10:07,699
to stop the monster, Kady...
was busy doing something else.

197
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:11,679
Iris could have at least left us a
stone-bleeding how-to or something.

198
00:10:11,699 --> 00:10:14,629
Yeah, I hear
what you're saying, Q.

199
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:17,909
- Hey.
- Don't mind me.

200
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:27,699
Uh, I'll go check those other books.
The books in, uh, Marina's library,

201
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:30,819
'cause, uh, yep, that's got
to be where they are.

202
00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:36,639
Hey. Haven't seen you in a while.

203
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:38,909
There was some stuff
I had to do.

204
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:43,889
- Stuff I should be worried about?
- I'm clean.

205
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:46,659
Good.

206
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:50,739
Who's this?

207
00:10:50,749 --> 00:10:54,629
Five weeks ago, her dad picked her
up from school and disappeared...

208
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:55,899
Custody fight with her mom.

209
00:10:55,909 --> 00:11:00,899
Locator spell and a few bruised
knuckles later, she's home.

210
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:05,669
"Five weeks ago" as in when you
were "Detective Sam Cunningham"?

211
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:08,859
- You're solving her old case files?
- All right, look...

212
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:10,899
you lived as Kim for months.

213
00:11:10,909 --> 00:11:13,659
The moment you got
your memory back, you just...

214
00:11:13,669 --> 00:11:16,819
You dropped it
like it never happened.

215
00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:19,859
I-I can't.

216
00:11:19,869 --> 00:11:21,799
I can't go back
to being a sidekick.

217
00:11:21,819 --> 00:11:22,839
- You're not a sidekick.
- Come on.

218
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:26,699
I'm only in this group at all
because of Penny.

219
00:11:26,709 --> 00:11:28,659
That's not true.

220
00:11:28,669 --> 00:11:30,659
- You and me...
- We're friends, yeah.

221
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:33,639
And then we weren't,
and now we're what...

222
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:34,869
I don't know,
whatever you call it when...

223
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:39,839
you have a lot of history that
made you two very different people.

224
00:11:39,849 --> 00:11:42,739
I need my own path, Jules.

225
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:46,629
I want my life to feel
like it's about me.

226
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:50,307
No, I get that.
And I am all for your personal growth.

227
00:11:50,308 --> 00:11:52,168
It's just that we're... You know,
we're kind of under the gun here.

228
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:55,359
You're under my roof,
hidden from the McAllistairs

229
00:11:55,369 --> 00:11:57,379
and the Library because I took
this place from Marina

230
00:11:57,389 --> 00:12:01,329
when everyone else wanted to
hand her nuclear launch codes.

231
00:12:03,319 --> 00:12:07,289
Look, I'll help, of course...

232
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:10,539
when I can, in my way.

233
00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:13,399
But for now...

234
00:12:13,409 --> 00:12:16,299
Sam left a few loose ends
I need to tie up.

235
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:26,399
You're not my Postmate.

236
00:12:26,409 --> 00:12:28,359
I am the Baba Yaga.

237
00:12:28,369 --> 00:12:31,539
You live on my property
under my protection,

238
00:12:31,539 --> 00:12:34,339
and your rent is due.

239
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:38,329
Okay, well, this isn't
exactly my place.

240
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:40,339
Well, you're here now,

241
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:43,379
and the list is clearly posted
on the premises.

242
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:46,289
Wait, Marina's weird
grocery list on the fridge?

243
00:12:46,289 --> 00:12:47,359
It is not weird.

244
00:12:47,369 --> 00:12:49,329
You are weird.

245
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:52,409
You reek of nondairy creamer
and despair.

246
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:56,369
Okay, look, I don't have

247
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:58,289
whatever it is
that you're looking for.

248
00:12:58,299 --> 00:13:00,359
One Webster's Weeping Healer,

249
00:13:00,369 --> 00:13:02,499
one Totem of the Plump Pelican,

250
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:04,509
and one Bag of Holding.

251
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:10,389
Pay what is owed in two days'
time or wish I boiled you alive.

252
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,289
The wench will explain.

253
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:13,399
What?

254
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:22,539
Holy shit, you have to pay her.

255
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:26,045
"Her"? You mean you.
Okay, what the fuck is happening?

256
00:13:26,046 --> 00:13:30,299
I'm Bailey. Sorry about the Baba Yaga.
She can be a little...

257
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,409
The Baba's the spirit
of a vengeful Slavic witch

258
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:34,369
I channel when I need
to collect rent

259
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:36,329
or deal with a chatty
Uber driver.

260
00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:38,339
So if you don't want to be
her next meal,

261
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,559
you should give her
what she wants.

262
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,389
Ooh, stressful.

263
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:44,359
Where am I supposed to find...

264
00:13:44,369 --> 00:13:45,529
Wait a minute.

265
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:46,529
Is the...

266
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:50,289
The Totem of the Plump Pelican.

267
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:52,289
Wait, this thing?

268
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:53,449
Oh, yeah, that's it.

269
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:58,058
Oh. Marina must have found it. I just
thought it was some ugly paperweight.

270
00:13:58,059 --> 00:13:59,369
Shh, don't insult it.

271
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:00,569
It reacts.

272
00:14:01,289 --> 00:14:03,359
So two more to go.

273
00:14:03,369 --> 00:14:06,309
Oh, shit.
She's coming back.

274
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:13,549
Pay me what is owed, or I
will boil your marrow into soup, peasant.

275
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:17,379
See you Thursday.

276
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:28,272
I'm looking for a guy
called "Lovelady."

277
00:14:28,272 --> 00:14:30,302
Heard he has office hours here.

278
00:14:38,315 --> 00:14:39,405
What is this?

279
00:14:39,415 --> 00:14:40,475
Some kind of flashlight spell?

280
00:14:40,485 --> 00:14:43,405
Isik.

281
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,080
- Jesus.
- Whoa!

282
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,960
Satisfied?

283
00:14:55,382 --> 00:14:56,287
What the hell was that?

284
00:14:56,288 --> 00:14:58,285
I never want to see the floor
of a bar that bright.

285
00:14:58,296 --> 00:15:00,046
Pete?

286
00:15:00,056 --> 00:15:02,316
Wait, you're Lovelady?

287
00:15:02,326 --> 00:15:04,236
Oh, shit.

288
00:15:04,246 --> 00:15:06,096
Kady.

289
00:15:06,116 --> 00:15:07,296
It's been a while.

290
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:10,196
Last time I saw you,
you were with Marina.

291
00:15:10,206 --> 00:15:11,326
Mm.

292
00:15:11,792 --> 00:15:13,402
We parted ways.
It was mutual.

293
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:15,425
Mm, I'm sure.

294
00:15:16,962 --> 00:15:20,080
- So "Lovelady," huh?
- It's a title.

295
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:21,309
When one guy's done with it,

296
00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:24,441
he passes it on to the next guy,
kind of like "Dread Pirate Roberts"

297
00:15:24,443 --> 00:15:25,503
or "Senator."

298
00:15:25,513 --> 00:15:28,473
That's not how Senators work.

299
00:15:28,483 --> 00:15:30,443
Whatever.

300
00:15:30,453 --> 00:15:32,393
The guy who was "Lovelady
before me

301
00:15:32,403 --> 00:15:34,533
is an Earl
with a private island.

302
00:15:34,543 --> 00:15:36,443
People respect
the shit out of me.

303
00:15:36,453 --> 00:15:39,413
It's a great sign when
you have to tell people that.

304
00:15:39,423 --> 00:15:43,483
Did you come here looking
for my help or...?

305
00:15:43,503 --> 00:15:45,593
Sorry.

306
00:15:47,483 --> 00:15:52,503
Here's a list.
I heard you can find things.

307
00:15:52,513 --> 00:15:55,583
Interesting stuff.
Specific.

308
00:15:55,593 --> 00:15:58,383
Landlord issue.

309
00:15:58,393 --> 00:15:59,393
Have you considered moving?

310
00:15:59,403 --> 00:16:02,333
The place has special features.

311
00:16:02,343 --> 00:16:04,393
It just turns out it's courtesy
of a-a witch...

312
00:16:04,403 --> 00:16:07,583
- Uh, Baba-something.
- You mean the Baba Yaga?

313
00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:11,433
- You know her?
- Just by reputation.

314
00:16:11,443 --> 00:16:13,483
Hey, if I help you,

315
00:16:13,503 --> 00:16:17,483
in lieu of my usual fee,
I want you to introduce me.

316
00:16:17,503 --> 00:16:21,313
- Not sure she's your type.
- She's got great taste.

317
00:16:21,323 --> 00:16:25,403
This could open up
a whole new avenue for me.

318
00:16:25,413 --> 00:16:29,513
Yeah, fine, whatever.
You'll help?

319
00:16:29,523 --> 00:16:33,483
One more thing.
Um, do you still see Julia?

320
00:16:33,503 --> 00:16:35,523
Don't be a creep, Pete.

321
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:37,513
Where are we going?

322
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:41,403
Black Market.

323
00:16:41,413 --> 00:16:44,443
So Kady's moved on.

324
00:16:44,453 --> 00:16:47,363
I mean, not with Pete, just...

325
00:16:47,383 --> 00:16:51,433
I know what you mean,
and I'm happy for her.

326
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:53,443
You don't look happy.

327
00:16:53,453 --> 00:16:59,259
So is there some sort of connection
I'm supposed to be seeing between Kady,

328
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,390
Zelda, Fen...

329
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,290
You'll see.

330
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,250
Alice's book had been revised,

331
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:09,190
but Alice had changed
the ending.

332
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,200
- Well?
- Apparently, Alice feels

333
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:13,290
magic has caused her
nothing but trouble.

334
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,290
She goes on to live out

335
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,370
an entirely civilian life
in Portland.

336
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,220
She just got a job
at a craft brewery,

337
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,370
and a Shih Tzu.

338
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,300
You look a little surprised.

339
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,300
Does that not sound like her?

340
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,240
The choice is unexpected, but...

341
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,350
wouldn't be the first time
she walked away from magic.

342
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,300
Great, then.

343
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,310
Nick is still at large,

344
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,380
so we'll keep our trackers
in circulation,

345
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:38,330
but I think we can close
the book on Alice Quinn.

346
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,400
It's funny...

347
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,340
I'd always thought
she was a cat person.

348
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,380
Never seen her before.
Sorry.

349
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:50,250
She would be a new hire.

350
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,310
We're not hiring right now.

351
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,300
In fact, we've had
to let some people go.

352
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:57,160
Designer hops
are getting expensive.

353
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,250
Well?

354
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:08,180
Alice is inside,
as her book said.

355
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,160
Hmm.
Good riddance, book tart.

356
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,320
Let's go get some doughnuts.

357
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,350
This is the Black Market?

358
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,360
It's so...
Normal?

359
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,290
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

360
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,190
You'd be surprised
what you can find in here.

361
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,410
Even Deweys.

362
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,370
Wait, I thought you had to
have a Library card for that?

363
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,180
Yeah, well, the Library
should know better

364
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,220
than to give
unlimited black cards

365
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,230
to rich druggie dickbags

366
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,300
that trade them in
for lap dances.

367
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,260
Oh, so you give lap dances, huh?

368
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,210
Selectively.

369
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,320
Okay, so that is Whitley.

370
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,200
If she does not have
a Bag of Holding,

371
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,350
she'll have a line on one.

372
00:18:47,757 --> 00:18:48,807
What, you're not gonna
introduce me?

373
00:18:48,817 --> 00:18:51,737
Well, I may have
had sex with her

374
00:18:51,747 --> 00:18:52,932
and never called her again.

375
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:54,923
Classy.

376
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:58,033
Hey, I'm looking
for a Bag of Holding...

377
00:18:58,043 --> 00:19:00,083
whatever that is.

378
00:19:00,093 --> 00:19:02,083
It's a "Doctor Who"
kind of thing.

379
00:19:02,093 --> 00:19:03,983
A bag that's bigger
on the inside.

380
00:19:03,993 --> 00:19:05,973
Actually, it's a D&D thing.

381
00:19:05,983 --> 00:19:07,083
Yeah, I don't do nerd shit.

382
00:19:07,093 --> 00:19:08,943
Expensive taste for someone

383
00:19:08,953 --> 00:19:12,093
who doesn't know
what they're asking for.

384
00:19:12,103 --> 00:19:15,033
I can pay.

385
00:19:15,043 --> 00:19:17,043
Charisma Cufflinks...

386
00:19:17,053 --> 00:19:19,033
for a Bag of Holding?

387
00:19:19,043 --> 00:19:21,983
Come back when you're serious.

388
00:19:29,724 --> 00:19:32,354
Kraken tentacles...
Helps build muscle.

389
00:19:32,356 --> 00:19:33,182
I'm paleo.

390
00:19:33,183 --> 00:19:35,353
Cavemen didn't eat kraken,
so I don't eat kraken.

391
00:19:38,173 --> 00:19:40,253
What'll you give me for these?

392
00:19:50,847 --> 00:19:52,389
Aleister Crowley's ashes.

393
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,350
- Mm-hmm.
- Not bad.

394
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,460
Worth a Bag of Holding?

395
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:04,510
Thanks.

396
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,018
What the hell, Pete?

397
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:09,989
I searched the whole
goddamn market for you.

398
00:20:09,999 --> 00:20:11,999
Kady, great news.

399
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:13,009
I found Gordy.

400
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:16,009
Gordy's my, um...

401
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:18,069
He's great.
Hi, Kaitlin.

402
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:19,119
Kady.

403
00:20:19,856 --> 00:20:21,896
You were supposed to be looking

404
00:20:21,896 --> 00:20:23,896
for the Webster's
Weeping Whatever,

405
00:20:23,896 --> 00:20:24,942
not getting wasted.

406
00:20:24,943 --> 00:20:26,953
¿Por qué no los dos, mamacita?

407
00:20:26,963 --> 00:20:30,863
I'll have you know
Gordy is a doctor.

408
00:20:30,873 --> 00:20:33,447
- Well...
- For animals.

409
00:20:33,504 --> 00:20:36,294
You know, for dogs and cats.

410
00:20:36,304 --> 00:20:37,454
Don't sell yourself short,
all right?

411
00:20:37,464 --> 00:20:38,494
That's a real doctor.
Ok... shh, shh, shh.

412
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:40,454
Not helpful.

413
00:20:40,464 --> 00:20:43,494
Yes, helpful,
because Gordy knows

414
00:20:43,504 --> 00:20:46,404
where to get that thing
that you're looking for.

415
00:20:46,414 --> 00:20:49,374
The thing. The creepy doll
that cries healing tears.

416
00:20:49,384 --> 00:20:51,434
Webster's Weeping Healer.

417
00:20:51,444 --> 00:20:54,454
Got a buddy, Duke...
Exotic-bird guy.

418
00:20:54,464 --> 00:20:56,494
So his cockatoo
caught bumblefoot...

419
00:20:56,504 --> 00:20:58,314
Okay, shh.

420
00:20:58,324 --> 00:20:59,404
Duke has the doll?

421
00:20:59,414 --> 00:21:01,244
Well, yeah.

422
00:21:01,244 --> 00:21:02,514
Okay, where can I find him?

423
00:21:07,424 --> 00:21:10,244
Hello?
Anybody there?

424
00:21:13,424 --> 00:21:16,374
I'm guessing no one's home.

425
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:25,374
Well, that explains it.

426
00:21:27,366 --> 00:21:29,640
No sign of blunt-force trauma
or defensive wounds.

427
00:21:30,366 --> 00:21:32,296
Doesn't look like foul play.

428
00:21:32,306 --> 00:21:34,296
Okay, Mariska Hargitay.

429
00:21:34,306 --> 00:21:37,336
Just find the doll, will you?

430
00:21:50,286 --> 00:21:55,336
No, bad touch!
Get off!

431
00:21:55,346 --> 00:21:57,246
God, I hate this place.

432
00:21:57,256 --> 00:22:00,296
But...
found the doll.

433
00:22:00,306 --> 00:22:02,186
Ugh.

434
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:06,246
Healing tears or no,
I would not keep this thing in my house.

435
00:22:08,376 --> 00:22:10,276
Really, Pete?

436
00:22:10,286 --> 00:22:12,276
What?
He's not using it.

437
00:22:12,286 --> 00:22:14,356
You're disgusting.

438
00:22:28,356 --> 00:22:31,266
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.

439
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:37,886
Jesus, Fen!

440
00:22:37,896 --> 00:22:39,840
Why the hell are you lurking
in a dark pantry?

441
00:22:39,849 --> 00:22:40,999
Waiting for you.

442
00:22:41,009 --> 00:22:43,079
Your soufflé fell.
You're gonna bake a new one.

443
00:22:43,089 --> 00:22:45,979
- How did you...
- Dreamt it.

444
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:50,979
You're worried Margo is gonna
blow talks with Lady Pike.

445
00:22:50,989 --> 00:22:54,069
Wait, again with
the alpaca lady?

446
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,929
Sorry.

447
00:22:55,939 --> 00:22:57,969
Uh, some of these pages
are out of order.

448
00:22:57,979 --> 00:22:59,939
Just keep reading.

449
00:22:59,949 --> 00:23:01,596
But really, you're worried
that you and she have

450
00:23:01,597 --> 00:23:03,577
a true connection and you're
going to screw it up,

451
00:23:03,587 --> 00:23:04,657
so you're stress-baking.

452
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:05,763
Okay, ouch.

453
00:23:05,764 --> 00:23:08,724
And that's a weirdly specific
and accurate dream.

454
00:23:08,734 --> 00:23:10,564
I also dreamt
of dancing ears of corn,

455
00:23:10,574 --> 00:23:12,654
and then the farmers reported
a surplus.

456
00:23:12,664 --> 00:23:14,574
I dreamt about what Tick
really does

457
00:23:14,584 --> 00:23:15,764
with all those peaches
he steals from the kitchen,

458
00:23:15,774 --> 00:23:17,824
which is surprisingly not gross.

459
00:23:17,834 --> 00:23:20,674
And they've all come true.

460
00:23:20,694 --> 00:23:23,714
Prophetic dreams could mean
a lot of things.

461
00:23:23,724 --> 00:23:25,734
Uh, maybe you're a psychic

462
00:23:25,744 --> 00:23:28,574
or someone cast some kind
of spell on you.

463
00:23:28,584 --> 00:23:31,724
Or... or it's Fillory, and maybe
you just ate some messed-up fruit.

464
00:23:31,734 --> 00:23:33,734
You think someone
did this to me?

465
00:23:33,744 --> 00:23:35,634
If you're worried,
next time it happens

466
00:23:35,644 --> 00:23:37,704
just poke around the dream
a little.

467
00:23:37,714 --> 00:23:39,714
Poke with what?
A knife?

468
00:23:40,217 --> 00:23:41,317
No.
No knives.

469
00:23:41,327 --> 00:23:43,277
Lucid dreaming.

470
00:23:43,287 --> 00:23:45,207
They teach it first semester
at Brakebills.

471
00:23:45,217 --> 00:23:46,327
The second you realize
you're dreaming,

472
00:23:46,337 --> 00:23:48,257
you can take control
of your dream.

473
00:23:48,267 --> 00:23:52,077
- You don't even need magic to do it.
- Just close your eyes...

474
00:23:52,087 --> 00:23:56,307
Breathe, and try to push your
finger through your other hand.

475
00:23:56,564 --> 00:23:57,906
Everything freezes.

476
00:23:57,908 --> 00:24:01,928
Anything not supposed to be there,
that's when you'll be able to tell.

477
00:24:01,938 --> 00:24:03,928
Alice wasn't where
her book said she'd be.

478
00:24:03,938 --> 00:24:06,938
I suspect she sabotaged it.

479
00:24:06,948 --> 00:24:09,978
And now I've lied
to my colleagues.

480
00:24:09,988 --> 00:24:13,928
If I don't find her
before they find out...

481
00:24:13,938 --> 00:24:15,968
Sounds like a personal problem.

482
00:24:17,908 --> 00:24:20,838
Henry, please.

483
00:24:20,848 --> 00:24:22,748
I'm trusting you.

484
00:24:22,758 --> 00:24:24,748
What you mean is that you trust

485
00:24:24,748 --> 00:24:25,958
that I won't report this

486
00:24:25,968 --> 00:24:27,938
because it'd be worse for Alice.

487
00:24:27,948 --> 00:24:29,898
We both want to spare her that.

488
00:24:29,908 --> 00:24:31,758
If you could just tell me
where she is...

489
00:24:31,768 --> 00:24:35,028
I comply with every request...

490
00:24:35,748 --> 00:24:38,898
All your red tape
and your triplicate bullshit.

491
00:24:41,748 --> 00:24:44,878
This is your mess.
Do not drag me into it.

492
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:11,018
Harriet?

493
00:25:38,008 --> 00:25:41,888
I don't think an ancient Slavic
witch is gonna want a mojito.

494
00:25:41,898 --> 00:25:45,018
Right, um...
something vodka-based?

495
00:25:45,028 --> 00:25:48,948
- Are you actually nervous?
- Baba Yaga's a really big deal

496
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:50,898
in my line of work, and...

497
00:25:50,908 --> 00:25:53,848
First impressions...

498
00:25:53,858 --> 00:25:56,978
- What was I saying?
- Pete, your arm.

499
00:25:56,988 --> 00:26:03,788
Ah... that molest-y
hand gave me the clap.

500
00:26:03,798 --> 00:26:05,798
Oh, shit.

501
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:08,680
Looks like
a bad spell interaction.

502
00:26:08,931 --> 00:26:11,421
Something's clashing with one
of his personal enchantments.

503
00:26:11,423 --> 00:26:12,413
Which personal enchantment?

504
00:26:12,423 --> 00:26:14,263
I don't know.
They're personal.

505
00:26:14,804 --> 00:26:16,944
Hedge spells, you know,
they're off the street at best.

506
00:26:16,954 --> 00:26:18,764
They got a lot of rough edges.

507
00:26:18,946 --> 00:26:20,796
There's really no telling
if they'll play nice together

508
00:26:20,796 --> 00:26:22,838
until, well, they don't.

509
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,190
Whatever killed Duke
is killing him.

510
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:28,130
So help him,
or I break your jaw.

511
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:30,200
Look, the only human
diagnostic spell I know

512
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,620
costs magic, and I'm a little
Dewey-light at the mo...

513
00:26:32,621 --> 00:26:34,605
Please don't break my jaw.

514
00:26:34,615 --> 00:26:35,815
Fine.

515
00:26:35,825 --> 00:26:38,585
Pete has one he took off
your friend Duke.

516
00:26:38,595 --> 00:26:41,765
Wait. Wait, you said
something's clashing with Pete.

517
00:26:41,775 --> 00:26:42,855
Mm-hmm.

518
00:26:42,865 --> 00:26:45,605
- Like what?
- Like a cursed object.

519
00:26:45,615 --> 00:26:47,585
I once treated a horse
for strangles.

520
00:26:47,595 --> 00:26:49,615
Turns out jockey's riding crop
interacted badly

521
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:51,795
with a hoof-protection
spell, so...

522
00:26:51,805 --> 00:26:53,815
Does Pete carry a riding crop?

523
00:26:53,825 --> 00:26:56,735
Okay, maybe just look at this.

524
00:26:57,835 --> 00:26:59,635
Cobalt.

525
00:26:59,645 --> 00:27:00,835
Don't touch that shit.

526
00:27:00,845 --> 00:27:02,835
Not really planning to
now that you licked it.

527
00:27:02,845 --> 00:27:04,755
What?
It's more accurate than lenses.

528
00:27:04,765 --> 00:27:05,745
You can taste cobalt.

529
00:27:05,755 --> 00:27:07,655
It's used in most
tracking spells.

530
00:27:07,665 --> 00:27:08,805
- "Tracking spells"?
- Mm-hmm.

531
00:27:08,815 --> 00:27:10,065
I put them on pets.

532
00:27:10,069 --> 00:27:11,805
This one tastes like
a real expensive Searcher.

533
00:27:11,806 --> 00:27:14,210
You hold it long enough,
it kind of sends out

534
00:27:14,211 --> 00:27:16,151
a signal to whoever cast it.

535
00:27:16,161 --> 00:27:19,680
- Wait, a-a signal to wh... who?
- Aliens.

536
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:21,691
I was thinking more like
who makes Deweys.

537
00:27:22,411 --> 00:27:24,061
- The Library.
- Oh, yeah.

538
00:27:24,411 --> 00:27:25,631
That makes more sense.

539
00:27:25,641 --> 00:27:27,691
Who's the Library looking for?

540
00:27:28,411 --> 00:27:29,661
Oh, I can think of a few people.

541
00:27:29,671 --> 00:27:32,611
Wait, how many hedges have
these personal enchantments?

542
00:27:32,621 --> 00:27:34,631
Pretty much everybody.

543
00:27:34,641 --> 00:27:36,431
Shit.

544
00:27:36,441 --> 00:27:38,451
Take off all of Pete's, now.

545
00:27:38,461 --> 00:27:39,661
What are you gonna do?

546
00:27:39,671 --> 00:27:41,611
I'm gonna warn everybody.

547
00:27:41,621 --> 00:27:42,661
Wait a second.

548
00:27:42,671 --> 00:27:45,641
So the Library's responsible
for hedge witches dying?

549
00:27:45,651 --> 00:27:47,641
Yeah, but they don't
know that yet.

550
00:27:47,651 --> 00:27:49,561
Spoiler alert.

551
00:27:49,571 --> 00:27:51,591
Zelda had some other things
on her mind at the time.

552
00:27:51,601 --> 00:27:53,431
Her dead daughter.

553
00:27:53,441 --> 00:27:56,481
Wait, is she, like, down here?

554
00:27:56,491 --> 00:27:59,431
I thought you didn't
like spoilers.

555
00:27:59,686 --> 00:28:00,926
Look, I'm sorry
you see dead people,

556
00:28:00,936 --> 00:28:02,886
but that is
an incredibly stupid idea.

557
00:28:02,896 --> 00:28:05,419
She's not dead.
Ghosts don't bleed.

558
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:08,406
I don't know how,
but she could be alive stuck in there.

559
00:28:08,407 --> 00:28:10,387
That's insane...
And impossible.

560
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:11,527
It's the Mirror Realm.

561
00:28:11,537 --> 00:28:14,417
We don't know what's impossible.

562
00:28:14,427 --> 00:28:16,417
It's not as complicated
as a mirror bridge.

563
00:28:16,427 --> 00:28:18,547
We just need to open a door
to the place between mirrors.

564
00:28:18,557 --> 00:28:20,417
Listen, Zelds,
if you told me you wanted

565
00:28:20,427 --> 00:28:22,337
to finger-paint your blood
so you could take a walk

566
00:28:22,347 --> 00:28:24,557
in the crazy dimension
I would say, "Free country."

567
00:28:24,567 --> 00:28:27,357
But this is my blood.

568
00:28:27,367 --> 00:28:29,387
I can't do this...

569
00:28:29,397 --> 00:28:30,577
without your help.

570
00:28:30,587 --> 00:28:32,387
Yes, I know that.

571
00:28:32,397 --> 00:28:34,437
And I'm leaving.
She's my daughter.

572
00:28:37,337 --> 00:28:39,367
Harriet...

573
00:28:39,377 --> 00:28:40,587
who's older than you?

574
00:28:40,597 --> 00:28:44,357
Our relationship is complicated.

575
00:28:44,367 --> 00:28:45,557
Clearly.

576
00:28:45,567 --> 00:28:49,597
You smashed the mirror.
You...

577
00:28:49,607 --> 00:28:51,377
trapped her there.

578
00:28:51,387 --> 00:28:52,447
I was doing my job.

579
00:28:52,467 --> 00:28:55,557
I can't...

580
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:59,407
Live with myself if I don't
find a way to help her.

581
00:29:02,547 --> 00:29:04,557
Please.

582
00:29:06,357 --> 00:29:09,607
Christ.

583
00:29:09,617 --> 00:29:11,597
I'm gonna regret this, aren't I?

584
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:18,517
- Did you juice the beets?
- Oh, I juiced the beets.

585
00:29:18,527 --> 00:29:20,337
I told you I would
juice the beets.

586
00:29:20,337 --> 00:29:23,437
Why wouldn't I juice the beets?
Don't make this about us.

587
00:29:23,447 --> 00:29:25,337
Wait, did I miss something?

588
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:26,607
I thought Margo and Josh

589
00:29:26,617 --> 00:29:29,537
were an unlikely
yet heartwarming thing.

590
00:29:29,547 --> 00:29:32,357
No, this is after
the Lady Pike incident.

591
00:29:32,367 --> 00:29:34,567
Margo called Josh a sweater boy.

592
00:29:34,577 --> 00:29:36,337
Forget it.

593
00:29:36,347 --> 00:29:37,517
Pay attention to Fen.

594
00:29:37,527 --> 00:29:39,437
How's this shit work?

595
00:29:39,447 --> 00:29:43,537
Pour it gently
onto the lizard, Your Majesty.

596
00:29:53,577 --> 00:29:57,387
Jesus lizard-fucking Christ!

597
00:30:00,407 --> 00:30:05,377
Does this feel like a weird
sort of dream to any of you?

598
00:30:09,577 --> 00:30:12,437
All right, maybe I can
control this.

599
00:30:18,377 --> 00:30:22,427
Ember's balls.
This is a dream.

600
00:30:22,437 --> 00:30:26,397
Okay, okay. Stop talking to
yourself and, uh, look around.

601
00:30:28,417 --> 00:30:32,587
Hey! Who are you?
Wait, no! Stop, please!

602
00:30:32,587 --> 00:30:36,387
Freeze! Freeze!
Hey, hey, stop!

603
00:30:36,397 --> 00:30:40,587
Freeze! Green Lady! Hold up!
Hey, Green Lady, come back!

604
00:30:45,337 --> 00:30:47,557
Umber's ass,
this is getting annoying.

605
00:30:58,397 --> 00:31:01,617
Hey, wait!
Wait, I just want to talk!

606
00:31:02,337 --> 00:31:04,367
Why am I having
these stupid dreams?

607
00:31:04,377 --> 00:31:07,437
Oh, no. The lizard.

608
00:31:07,447 --> 00:31:10,387
You pour it gently
onto the lizard, Your Majesty.

609
00:31:10,397 --> 00:31:12,367
Wait, stop!
It'll catch fire!

610
00:31:12,377 --> 00:31:13,547
The fuck?

611
00:31:13,557 --> 00:31:19,357
I saw the lizard
blow up when Rafe...

612
00:31:19,367 --> 00:31:20,577
Antidote.

613
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:22,577
What is she talking about?

614
00:31:22,587 --> 00:31:24,417
Perhaps she's mad with grief

615
00:31:24,427 --> 00:31:26,577
over the loss of King Eliot,
Your Majesty.

616
00:31:26,587 --> 00:31:30,557
I assure you, all the animals have
responded quite positively to the antidote.

617
00:31:30,567 --> 00:31:33,347
Well, this one definitely won't.

618
00:31:33,357 --> 00:31:35,577
Foosh.
Fried Lizard.

619
00:31:35,587 --> 00:31:38,417
And where are you getting
this information?

620
00:31:42,397 --> 00:31:43,577
I...

621
00:31:43,587 --> 00:31:45,427
I dreamt it.

622
00:31:45,437 --> 00:31:48,557
Fen has been having
kind of prophetic dreams.

623
00:31:48,567 --> 00:31:51,447
She knew my soufflé was gonna
fall before that ever happened.

624
00:31:51,467 --> 00:31:53,980
- It's a stupid fucking premonition.
- You want to risk the life of your lizard,

625
00:31:53,981 --> 00:31:56,191
or is that a relationship you're
willing to set fire to as well?

626
00:31:56,201 --> 00:31:58,041
Oh, I'll fucking fry
this lizard.

627
00:31:58,061 --> 00:32:00,470
Okay, can we...
can we focus for one minute?

628
00:32:00,471 --> 00:32:01,420
- Sure.
- Yes.

629
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:02,529
- Fine.
- Let's.

630
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:03,530
- Cool.
- Great.

631
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,500
Okay.

632
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:08,500
Say I don't dose
Newt Scamander with beet juice.

633
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:11,530
How the shit am I supposed
to get his wrinkly ass talking?

634
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:16,480
I don't know, but I have an idea
of where to look for answers.

635
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:17,710
I lucid-dreamed.

636
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:20,450
I saw a woman in a green hood.

637
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,530
She has to be the one
giving me premonitions.

638
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:26,440
- Awesome. You got it working. A-plus.
- B minus.

639
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:27,610
Unless...

640
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:30,530
you tell us
where this green bitch went.

641
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:33,590
Well, in my dream,
I chased her to this stream

642
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,500
by the Fuschia Forest
of Corian's Land.

643
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:38,580
Corian's Land...

644
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:41,460
also known as Sloth's Bane.

645
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:44,430
I don't know what everything
in my dreams means... mean.

646
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:49,510
Anyway, I know that the answers to our
questions... Answers lie... lay there?

647
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,460
I-I'm not usually the one

648
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,570
who gives the big speech, so I'm...
I'm going.

649
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,590
So that... that's happening.

650
00:33:04,501 --> 00:33:06,491
Gordy says "you're welcome."

651
00:33:06,501 --> 00:33:08,531
And he left you a bill.

652
00:33:08,541 --> 00:33:11,661
That guy puts a really
high value on his time.

653
00:33:14,601 --> 00:33:16,601
Wait, did I miss the Baba Yaga?

654
00:33:16,621 --> 00:33:18,671
Well, you snooze, you lose.

655
00:33:18,681 --> 00:33:21,491
I wasn't snoozing, I was dying.

656
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:23,701
We got bigger fish to fry.

657
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:28,501
I'll explain everything as soon as
your hedge witch friends get here.

658
00:33:31,521 --> 00:33:35,701
I know every instinct is telling
you not to trust me... or anyone.

659
00:33:35,711 --> 00:33:39,491
But someone put a tracker on this.

660
00:33:39,501 --> 00:33:43,691
It's a complex, expensive,
very high-level spell.

661
00:33:49,771 --> 00:33:51,621
It marked him.

662
00:33:51,621 --> 00:33:55,501
It looks like the Deweys you touched
are doing the same to you.

663
00:33:55,521 --> 00:33:57,541
If you have any
enchantments running...

664
00:33:57,561 --> 00:34:00,621
Anything you got in a safe house,
anything homebrewed... It could kill you...

665
00:34:00,641 --> 00:34:04,491
just like it did to Duke
and almost did to Pete.

666
00:34:05,621 --> 00:34:10,371
She saved my life.
I trust her, and I vouch for her.

667
00:34:10,385 --> 00:34:14,776
- Who did this?
- The Library.

668
00:34:14,776 --> 00:34:16,288
They make the Deweys,
and they don't give a shit

669
00:34:16,289 --> 00:34:18,369
about what happens
to the hedges.

670
00:34:18,369 --> 00:34:21,289
They're trying to find someone,

671
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:23,349
and we're just
collateral damage.

672
00:34:23,349 --> 00:34:26,329
So ask yourselves...
If this is what they do

673
00:34:26,329 --> 00:34:29,329
when they're not even
thinking about us,

674
00:34:29,329 --> 00:34:32,329
what happens when they decide
we're a threat?

675
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:39,389
Are we just gonna let people like
them tell us we're not important?

676
00:34:42,209 --> 00:34:47,329
That we're just some side characters
in their fucked-up fascist plot?

677
00:34:47,329 --> 00:34:55,189
My mom was a hedge...
and she was killed by another hedge.

678
00:34:55,189 --> 00:34:57,389
You'd think that would
turn me against you.

679
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:02,369
But it didn't.

680
00:35:02,389 --> 00:35:06,309
It just made me realize that
it doesn't have to be this way.

681
00:35:06,309 --> 00:35:11,249
If we could stop screwing each other
over long enough to work together,

682
00:35:11,269 --> 00:35:14,409
then it's not
the Library's story.

683
00:35:14,429 --> 00:35:17,369
It's our story.

684
00:35:24,209 --> 00:35:25,249
- Hey.
- Hey.

685
00:35:25,249 --> 00:35:27,249
I have a buddy in Modesto.

686
00:35:27,249 --> 00:35:30,209
He says there's a leaky
Library pipe there.

687
00:35:30,229 --> 00:35:33,249
I say we use it
to make those assholes pay.

688
00:35:33,249 --> 00:35:34,349
Look, I know
what you're going through...

689
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:36,749
Do you?
They kill your boyfriend?

690
00:35:36,751 --> 00:35:37,911
Actually, yeah.

691
00:35:41,329 --> 00:35:42,877
Look, we'll figure out
what to do next.

692
00:35:42,879 --> 00:35:43,959
I already know what to do.

693
00:35:43,979 --> 00:35:47,939
You do that, you're giving
them a reason to wipe us out.

694
00:35:47,939 --> 00:35:51,849
Please just get a little sleep.
We'll talk tomorrow.

695
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:54,059
Hey, you're not alone, okay?

696
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,079
We'll figure this out together in
a way that feels right for you.

697
00:35:59,019 --> 00:36:00,959
Okay.

698
00:36:00,979 --> 00:36:02,939
Yeah, we can do that.

699
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:19,019
It's a copy of our library,
but wrong.

700
00:36:21,129 --> 00:36:23,879
I was gonna say
a total mindfuck.

701
00:36:23,879 --> 00:36:25,939
Tomato, tomah-to.

702
00:36:28,129 --> 00:36:29,979
Oh, you go on.

703
00:36:29,999 --> 00:36:32,979
I'll just be here cutting myself
to keep our bloody exit open.

704
00:36:32,999 --> 00:36:35,079
Hey, just made a joke.

705
00:36:45,999 --> 00:36:48,019
Hello?

706
00:38:34,959 --> 00:38:36,039
Where have you been?

707
00:38:36,059 --> 00:38:40,230
Your funhouse-mirror daughter
shanked me. We have to go.

708
00:38:40,231 --> 00:38:41,160
Those things weren't her.

709
00:38:41,166 --> 00:38:42,664
The real Harriet
could still be in here.

710
00:38:42,668 --> 00:38:43,704
I can't just leave her.

711
00:38:43,707 --> 00:38:44,927
I hate to break it
to you, love...

712
00:38:44,927 --> 00:38:46,767
She might still be in there,
but so are those monsters.

713
00:39:06,757 --> 00:39:07,757
An attack?

714
00:39:07,777 --> 00:39:08,817
On what branch?

715
00:39:08,817 --> 00:39:11,757
Modesto, California.

716
00:39:11,757 --> 00:39:13,897
We lost four Librarians.

717
00:39:13,897 --> 00:39:15,817
Hedge witches did it.

718
00:39:15,837 --> 00:39:17,757
But... but why?

719
00:39:20,797 --> 00:39:24,737
There was some fallout
from your tracker coins.

720
00:39:24,757 --> 00:39:26,817
It's not your fault.

721
00:39:26,817 --> 00:39:28,857
Just unforeseen interaction.

722
00:39:28,877 --> 00:39:30,917
Several hedges died.

723
00:39:30,927 --> 00:39:35,877
The whole point of doing this was
to avoid having to hurt anyone.

724
00:39:35,897 --> 00:39:37,817
I should have been here.

725
00:39:37,817 --> 00:39:39,717
You can't blame yourself.

726
00:39:39,737 --> 00:39:42,797
If anything, today we learned
the true danger we're in

727
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:45,797
and that your trackers
might provide a solution.

728
00:39:47,737 --> 00:39:48,917
What do you mean?

729
00:39:48,927 --> 00:39:51,777
Complications aside...

730
00:39:51,777 --> 00:39:53,737
the idea is sound.

731
00:39:53,757 --> 00:39:57,757
Put whatever we have
into circulation among them.

732
00:39:57,757 --> 00:40:00,877
We keep Modesto
from happening again.

733
00:40:00,877 --> 00:40:03,927
Are you suggesting
we kill hedge witches?

734
00:40:03,927 --> 00:40:06,777
I am suggesting
that we keep an eye on them.

735
00:40:06,777 --> 00:40:09,130
To "protect the flame
of knowledge from ever

736
00:40:09,131 --> 00:40:11,881
being extinguished,
no matter the cost."

737
00:40:13,927 --> 00:40:16,677
I don't know what to say.

738
00:40:20,737 --> 00:40:22,777
This is an awesome responsibility.

739
00:40:22,797 --> 00:40:24,837
You and I both know that,
but who is better suited

740
00:40:24,857 --> 00:40:28,737
to bear that responsibility
than The Order?

741
00:40:29,947 --> 00:40:32,857
There is no one I trust
more deeply

742
00:40:32,877 --> 00:40:35,927
to be fair and right than you.

743
00:40:42,837 --> 00:40:44,837
Alice.

744
00:40:44,837 --> 00:40:46,817
I can't stay long.

745
00:40:46,817 --> 00:40:48,817
I-I cast a spell to keep
the Library from eavesdropping,

746
00:40:48,837 --> 00:40:51,777
but it won't last.

747
00:40:51,797 --> 00:40:53,697
I need your help.

748
00:40:53,697 --> 00:40:55,797
They have my friend Sheila.

749
00:40:55,797 --> 00:40:57,817
I know.

750
00:40:59,947 --> 00:41:01,897
Hello, Ms. Quinn.

751
00:41:01,897 --> 00:41:05,947
Alice, please.
Nothing will happen to you here.

752
00:41:05,947 --> 00:41:09,737
Zelda wants to talk.

753
00:41:09,757 --> 00:41:10,817
Why?

754
00:41:12,947 --> 00:41:14,897
I need your help.

755
00:41:16,817 --> 00:41:18,817
I think I've seen enough.

756
00:41:18,837 --> 00:41:23,897
To counteract a lifetime of cis-het
frat-bro bias? I-I doubt it.

757
00:41:23,897 --> 00:41:27,897
Okay. So tell me, what was
I supposed to take from that?

758
00:41:27,917 --> 00:41:30,757
Zelda doesn't know it yet,
but what she just set in motion

759
00:41:30,777 --> 00:41:32,877
is going to change
the Library forever.

760
00:41:32,877 --> 00:41:35,777
Same with Fen and Fillory,

761
00:41:35,777 --> 00:41:38,797
Kady and all of magic.

762
00:41:38,817 --> 00:41:40,817
When you file people away
as sidekicks,

763
00:41:40,837 --> 00:41:43,757
you don't realize
their importance to the story,

764
00:41:43,757 --> 00:41:48,797
and this story belongs to a
lot more people than you think.

765
00:41:48,817 --> 00:41:52,757
Where to shelve a book,
it's not a little thing.

766
00:41:52,757 --> 00:41:58,797
You're telling the world
what to value, who to value.

767
00:41:58,817 --> 00:42:02,917
- You get our responsibility here?
- Well said.

768
00:42:02,927 --> 00:42:05,817
I think you've earned
the right to move up.

769
00:42:05,817 --> 00:42:08,897
Excuse me?

770
00:42:08,897 --> 00:42:12,777
I know so much about you
and your friends,

771
00:42:12,797 --> 00:42:15,857
but you never asked me
how I died.

772
00:42:17,667 --> 00:42:19,667
O-okay, um...

773
00:42:19,677 --> 00:42:22,667
- How did you die?
- Arrow to the chest...

774
00:42:22,677 --> 00:42:24,917
- during the Crusades.
- "The Crusades"?

775
00:42:24,927 --> 00:42:26,927
1,000 years ago?

776
00:42:26,947 --> 00:42:28,817
We really thought the story

777
00:42:28,817 --> 00:42:31,857
was all about white guys
back then, believe me.

778
00:42:31,877 --> 00:42:34,817
And I'm not new at all.

779
00:42:34,837 --> 00:42:38,817
I'm actually
your supervisor's supervisor.

780
00:42:38,837 --> 00:42:41,677
So you're my boss.

781
00:42:41,677 --> 00:42:44,440
I fully see the irony of a
white guy giving you this test,

782
00:42:44,441 --> 00:42:48,697
but ladies upstairs love a twist,
so they always send me.

783
00:42:48,697 --> 00:42:51,817
- Send you to what?
- To promote you.

784
00:42:51,837 --> 00:42:54,677
You're clearly ready
for the next level.

785
00:42:54,677 --> 00:42:55,817
Which is?

786
00:42:55,837 --> 00:42:57,837
Secrets Taken to the Grave.

787
00:42:57,857 --> 00:42:59,897
You're gonna collect them.

788
00:42:59,897 --> 00:43:02,947
Congratulations.

789
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:04,717
Thank you.

790
00:43:04,717 --> 00:43:06,837
Oh, and, um, I'm afraid
we're gonna need you

791
00:43:06,837 --> 00:43:08,877
to start right away.

792
00:43:26,927 --> 00:43:34,977
Hey. Been a while.
Welcome to the Underworld.
