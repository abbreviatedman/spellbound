1
00:00:00,226 --> 00:00:02,273
Previously, on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:02,284 --> 00:00:05,016
Look, just go while you still
have the chance.

3
00:00:05,892 --> 00:00:09,358
The Library controls
the levels of ambient magic

4
00:00:09,369 --> 00:00:10,751
that flow through the pipes.

5
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:12,372
This one has a leak.

6
00:00:14,461 --> 00:00:17,715
Well, what's my Birthright,
you scaly shit?

7
00:00:17,725 --> 00:00:20,674
It's the talking animals.
They've all been struck dumb.

8
00:00:20,684 --> 00:00:23,677
- So what is this?
- I saved your fucking life, bitch.

9
00:00:23,687 --> 00:00:26,593
Margo, are you okay?

10
00:00:26,603 --> 00:00:28,532
You're just a brown-nose sweater boy

11
00:00:28,543 --> 00:00:30,293
desperate to matter at all.

12
00:00:30,303 --> 00:00:31,772
The other me, Sam,

13
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:33,207
did whatever she thought was right,

14
00:00:33,218 --> 00:00:34,890
regardless of what anybody else thought.

15
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:37,343
This contract initiates
our services in exchange for...

16
00:00:37,353 --> 00:00:39,867
"Unlimited manual and magical labor"?

17
00:00:39,877 --> 00:00:43,106
"Bound in service to the Library
up to and after my death"?

18
00:00:43,117 --> 00:00:45,612
- Penny, where are you?
- I'm in the Underworld Library.

19
00:00:45,622 --> 00:00:47,331
If you stay down here,

20
00:00:47,342 --> 00:00:49,790
you've got an amazing destiny
ahead of you.

21
00:01:13,346 --> 00:01:14,815
Uh, excuse me?

22
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,164
Mr. Adiyodi?

23
00:01:16,174 --> 00:01:18,341
Come in. Have a seat.

24
00:01:18,351 --> 00:01:20,082
Is...

25
00:01:21,528 --> 00:01:22,956
Did I do something wrong?

26
00:01:22,967 --> 00:01:24,805
I called you in to talk
about Matilda Fremont.

27
00:01:24,816 --> 00:01:26,610
You shelved her book yesterday

28
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,782
under "Disappointing Prodigies"?

29
00:01:28,793 --> 00:01:30,567
Oh, right.

30
00:01:30,578 --> 00:01:33,660
Uh, mastered the flute at seven
but became a mediocre poet.

31
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,009
Unremarkable.

32
00:01:35,019 --> 00:01:36,707
Did you read her brother's book?

33
00:01:36,717 --> 00:01:38,039
She saved his life...

34
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,145
pulled him out
of a self-destructive spiral,

35
00:01:40,155 --> 00:01:41,799
and he went on to become

36
00:01:41,809 --> 00:01:44,541
one of the world's
greatest philanthropists.

37
00:01:44,551 --> 00:01:46,847
I wouldn't call that "unremarkable."

38
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:52,341
Uh, okay. So is there section for,
uh, "Sisters of Generous Men"?

39
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:55,899
You've been in the Underworld branch,

40
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,858
- um, three weeks?
- Well...

41
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:59,947
Yeah, when I died, all I cared about

42
00:01:59,957 --> 00:02:03,864
was getting back up there,
and... and all this?

43
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,953
I didn't think it mattered...

44
00:02:05,963 --> 00:02:09,566
where a book goes, who reads it.

45
00:02:09,576 --> 00:02:12,046
Those books I lent you,
you get a chance to read them?

46
00:02:12,056 --> 00:02:13,579
Of course.

47
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,702
Well, I skimmed.

48
00:02:15,712 --> 00:02:17,095
How far did you get?

49
00:02:17,105 --> 00:02:19,010
Alice, uh, opened a pipe,

50
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,447
accidentally helped blow up
the Modesto branch,

51
00:02:21,457 --> 00:02:24,765
and Quentin played Pictionary
with a mummy.

52
00:02:25,853 --> 00:02:27,018
Where would you file them?

53
00:02:27,028 --> 00:02:28,454
Quentin and Alice...

54
00:02:28,464 --> 00:02:30,413
"Star-Crossed Romances," probably,

55
00:02:30,423 --> 00:02:32,893
or "Well-Meaning Failures."

56
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:35,069
- What about the others?
- Oh...

57
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:38,029
"Side Characters in Epic Quests."

58
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:39,552
I'm a side character?

59
00:02:39,562 --> 00:02:41,245
Look, no offense.

60
00:02:41,256 --> 00:02:44,122
It's just... Quentin's the center
of the whole thing.

61
00:02:44,132 --> 00:02:46,211
He's the one that knows everybody.

62
00:02:46,221 --> 00:02:48,039
He's the one the little
British girl picked

63
00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:50,084
to save the world.

64
00:02:50,094 --> 00:02:52,739
Or he's the one that looks like you.

65
00:02:52,749 --> 00:02:53,943
Not fair.

66
00:02:53,954 --> 00:02:57,222
Todd looks like me.
He's not the center of shit.

67
00:02:57,232 --> 00:02:58,518
But he could be.

68
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:02,793
All I'm saying is you think you've
seen stories like this before,

69
00:03:02,803 --> 00:03:05,143
so you can guess
what's going to happen...

70
00:03:05,153 --> 00:03:08,146
who's important and who isn't.

71
00:03:08,156 --> 00:03:11,236
But that's because you are
trapped in your POV.

72
00:03:11,246 --> 00:03:15,153
You have a classic case of
White Male Protagonism, Derek,

73
00:03:15,163 --> 00:03:18,286
and a Librarian simply can't have that.

74
00:03:18,296 --> 00:03:21,028
But that's why these books
are so important.

75
00:03:21,038 --> 00:03:22,682
They're such a gift.

76
00:03:22,692 --> 00:03:26,947
They... they can allow you
to see other points of view.

77
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:29,559
And once you start seeing that,

78
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:32,779
you'll find that the story
doesn't end the way you think,

79
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:36,566
and the most important characters
aren't who you expect.

80
00:03:41,581 --> 00:03:43,921
Remember back before
all the stuff in Modesto

81
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:47,577
when Alice first escaped
from the Library?

82
00:03:47,587 --> 00:03:49,143
Oh, dear.

83
00:03:49,153 --> 00:03:50,841
I'm telling you, I saw

84
00:03:50,851 --> 00:03:53,800
a reindeer-driven sleigh fly away.

85
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,628
Alice and Nick are gone.

86
00:03:55,638 --> 00:03:56,803
This is not funny.

87
00:03:56,813 --> 00:04:00,503
I'm not laughing... now.

88
00:04:00,513 --> 00:04:02,330
- I mean...
- Lets discuss next steps.

89
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,851
Mm, we should wait for Everett.
He'll know how to...

90
00:04:04,862 --> 00:04:08,728
Oh, he'll agree with me when I say
that Alice Quinn was your project.

91
00:04:08,738 --> 00:04:11,775
Holding her here was a mistake.
We aren't jailers.

92
00:04:11,785 --> 00:04:13,646
What would you have done?

93
00:04:13,656 --> 00:04:15,617
Alice broke her deal with us.

94
00:04:15,628 --> 00:04:19,870
She tried to turn off all of magic.
That has to have consequences.

95
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,655
Our mission is to preserve
the knowledge of magic.

96
00:04:22,665 --> 00:04:26,077
Alice Quinn is an existential
threat to that knowledge.

97
00:04:26,088 --> 00:04:28,870
Are you suggesting that
we should have killed her...

98
00:04:28,888 --> 00:04:30,880
And Santa Claus?

99
00:04:32,545 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm so sorry. It's not at all funny.

100
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,812
Do you agree with Cyrus?

101
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,486
I see.

102
00:04:42,205 --> 00:04:47,287
I admit, I took a personal interest
in Alice's rehabilitation.

103
00:04:47,298 --> 00:04:49,203
Perhaps it biased me.

104
00:04:49,213 --> 00:04:50,727
You are correct.

105
00:04:50,737 --> 00:04:52,555
We are not jailers.

106
00:04:52,565 --> 00:04:54,600
Nor are we killers.

107
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,995
So I'll ask again...
what would you have us do?

108
00:04:58,005 --> 00:04:59,910
"Protect the flame of knowledge

109
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,868
no matter the cost."

110
00:05:01,878 --> 00:05:04,567
I believe that's how the old motto goes.

111
00:05:04,577 --> 00:05:05,698
Everett.

112
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,091
Sorry I was delayed.

113
00:05:07,101 --> 00:05:10,311
The renovation of our Rome branch
ran into some difficulties.

114
00:05:10,321 --> 00:05:12,052
Have you been briefed on Alice?

115
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,706
I agree with Zelda.

116
00:05:13,716 --> 00:05:16,840
We are an order of scholars,
not assassins.

117
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,669
So what is the scholarly solution?

118
00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:20,931
Read their books.

119
00:05:20,941 --> 00:05:22,236
Learn their intentions.

120
00:05:22,246 --> 00:05:25,269
We agreed not to breach privacy
unless there was no other option.

121
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,457
What's the other option?

122
00:05:29,602 --> 00:05:31,115
Uh, okay.

123
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,421
Well, Nick's book has been taken

124
00:05:33,431 --> 00:05:35,119
and presumably destroyed,

125
00:05:35,129 --> 00:05:39,253
but Alice's is still in the Revision
Room having the ending put in.

126
00:05:39,263 --> 00:05:40,864
Which will take days,

127
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,735
and if she and Nick split up,
we'll lose them.

128
00:05:42,745 --> 00:05:44,737
There might be another way.

129
00:05:44,747 --> 00:05:46,652
Tracking devices.

130
00:05:46,662 --> 00:05:49,176
Eventually, they'll go
somewhere for help.

131
00:05:49,186 --> 00:05:50,656
There isn't enough ambient

132
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:52,440
to keep either of them happy long,

133
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:54,965
so disperse a Searcher widely and...

134
00:05:54,975 --> 00:05:56,923
Disperse to whom, though?

135
00:05:56,933 --> 00:05:58,838
I find it unlikely that Alice or Nick

136
00:05:58,848 --> 00:06:01,145
will run into the hands
of card-carrying Magicians.

137
00:06:01,155 --> 00:06:03,451
- They'll go underground.
- Yes.

138
00:06:03,461 --> 00:06:04,691
Where the hedge witches are.

139
00:06:04,702 --> 00:06:07,151
And the hedge witches don't trust us.

140
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:09,936
- We'll never get them to accept...
- If we do what I'm thinking,

141
00:06:09,946 --> 00:06:12,601
they'll take them without ever knowing.

142
00:06:14,298 --> 00:06:17,030
Fine. Trackers.

143
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,771
And once Alice's book is back,

144
00:06:18,781 --> 00:06:20,773
if we can verify
she's no longer a threat,

145
00:06:20,783 --> 00:06:23,123
there'd be no need
for further corrective action.

146
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,613
Agreed?

147
00:06:28,356 --> 00:06:29,879
All in favor?

148
00:06:38,192 --> 00:06:40,411
You seem troubled.

149
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,143
Thank you, but I'm fine.

150
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,843
I understand.

151
00:06:46,853 --> 00:06:49,976
I see something of Harriet
in Alice, too.

152
00:06:49,986 --> 00:06:53,414
I wish you'd given yourself some
real time to grieve your daughter.

153
00:06:53,424 --> 00:06:56,156
- Leave of absence, even.
- No, I'm...

154
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,381
Uh, I'm sorry.

155
00:07:07,308 --> 00:07:09,343
Zelda.

156
00:07:09,353 --> 00:07:13,043
I thought I heard something.

157
00:07:13,053 --> 00:07:15,446
Excuse me, I have a meeting.

158
00:07:24,264 --> 00:07:28,095
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

159
00:07:28,106 --> 00:07:30,408
So you're telling me the Head Librarian,

160
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:32,845
a member of the
Governing Council of the Order,

161
00:07:32,855 --> 00:07:34,542
is having a nervous breakdown?

162
00:07:34,552 --> 00:07:37,446
Trust me, just 'cause she's
seeing shit that no one else sees

163
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,895
doesn't mean it isn't really there.

164
00:07:38,906 --> 00:07:41,245
Uh, then we got to get
a message to this Everett guy.

165
00:07:41,255 --> 00:07:42,550
He's in charge, right?

166
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,856
Can't.

167
00:07:43,866 --> 00:07:46,001
What do you mean? There's
a dragon that connects

168
00:07:46,012 --> 00:07:47,512
the Underworld to the Neitherlands.

169
00:07:47,522 --> 00:07:49,361
We just take a note, and
we shove it up his...

170
00:07:49,372 --> 00:07:52,386
Not how that works.

171
00:07:52,396 --> 00:07:55,273
- Look, being down here...
- You mean being dead?

172
00:07:55,805 --> 00:07:58,218
It gives you a new perspective.

173
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,916
There's shit we know is going to happen

174
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:02,788
that people up there would
give anything to stop.

175
00:08:02,798 --> 00:08:04,747
But we can see the bigger picture.

176
00:08:04,757 --> 00:08:08,359
It's not our job to stop the
living from doing what they do.

177
00:08:08,369 --> 00:08:11,057
It's our job to appreciate
their full life.

178
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:14,887
We see but do not intervene...

179
00:08:14,897 --> 00:08:17,107
for a lot of good reasons.

180
00:08:17,117 --> 00:08:18,761
I can see this is wigging you out.

181
00:08:18,771 --> 00:08:21,851
Let's start with an easier one.

182
00:08:21,861 --> 00:08:25,071
Well, what's my Birthright,
you scaly shit?

183
00:08:25,081 --> 00:08:26,899
Wait...

184
00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:28,422
I read this one last week.

185
00:08:28,432 --> 00:08:32,078
High King of Fillory gets mad
at, uh, the alpaca lady,

186
00:08:32,088 --> 00:08:36,387
uh, to bring back
the talking animals' voices.

187
00:08:36,397 --> 00:08:38,041
You read Margo's story.

188
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,260
This one is not about her.

189
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:43,437
Well, what's my Birthright,
you scaly shit?

190
00:08:45,972 --> 00:08:47,833
Oh, hi, there.

191
00:08:47,843 --> 00:08:50,444
Do you have a message, or...?

192
00:08:56,547 --> 00:08:58,583
Okay, it was a dream.

193
00:08:58,593 --> 00:09:00,280
Just keep reading.

194
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,946
Well, what's my Birthright,
you scaly shit?

195
00:09:05,469 --> 00:09:07,461
It's the talking animals.

196
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:10,987
They've all been struck dumb.

197
00:09:10,997 --> 00:09:13,598
Well, shit.

198
00:09:13,608 --> 00:09:16,122
All right, Fen, I think
I will do a ritual.

199
00:09:16,132 --> 00:09:18,472
Earth specialty...
the Sleep of Solitude.

200
00:09:18,482 --> 00:09:20,953
I pop an Ambien, everyone
leaves me alone till noon.

201
00:09:20,963 --> 00:09:22,965
That'll be perfect.

202
00:09:25,446 --> 00:09:28,308
Rafe, last night I had
the strangest dream.

203
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:31,311
There were these bunnies
with their throats...

204
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:32,965
You know what?

205
00:09:32,975 --> 00:09:36,099
I think I projected
the talking animals going mute.

206
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,827
Okay, I think I'm starting to
get the point of these stories.

207
00:09:38,838 --> 00:09:42,148
All women are just one emotional
crisis away from a psychotic break.

208
00:09:42,158 --> 00:09:43,671
Jesus, no.

209
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:46,413
Whoa, you can't say stuff
like that anymore.

210
00:09:46,423 --> 00:09:47,632
What, in the afterlife?

211
00:09:47,642 --> 00:09:50,156
Anywhere.

212
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:53,986
Do you remember what Kady
was doing at this time?

213
00:09:53,996 --> 00:09:56,032
Didn't she just kind of peace out

214
00:09:56,042 --> 00:09:58,164
after the Library Dewey coin heist?

215
00:09:58,174 --> 00:09:59,271
Not exactly.

216
00:09:59,282 --> 00:10:01,864
See, while the others
were busy bleeding a stone

217
00:10:01,874 --> 00:10:04,344
to stop the monster, Kady...

218
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:07,565
was busy doing something else.

219
00:10:07,575 --> 00:10:09,480
Iris could have at least left us

220
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,525
a stone-bleeding how-to or something.

221
00:10:11,535 --> 00:10:14,277
Yeah, I hear what you're saying, Q.

222
00:10:15,626 --> 00:10:18,315
- Hey.
- Don't mind me.

223
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:25,539
Uh, I'll go check those other books.

224
00:10:25,549 --> 00:10:27,585
The books in, uh, Marina's library,

225
00:10:27,595 --> 00:10:30,903
'cause, uh, yep, that's got
to be where they are.

226
00:10:32,905 --> 00:10:34,548
Hey.

227
00:10:34,558 --> 00:10:36,376
Haven't seen you in a while.

228
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:39,292
There was some stuff I had to do.

229
00:10:39,302 --> 00:10:41,463
Stuff I should be worried about?

230
00:10:42,522 --> 00:10:44,209
I'm clean.

231
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,674
Good.

232
00:10:49,443 --> 00:10:50,738
Who's this?

233
00:10:50,748 --> 00:10:54,351
Five weeks ago, her dad picked her
up from school and disappeared...

234
00:10:54,361 --> 00:10:56,266
custody fight with her mom.

235
00:10:56,276 --> 00:10:59,704
Locator spell and a few
bruised knuckles later,

236
00:10:59,714 --> 00:11:01,271
she's home.

237
00:11:01,281 --> 00:11:05,492
"Five weeks ago" as in when you
were "Detective Sam Cunningham"?

238
00:11:05,502 --> 00:11:07,233
You're solving her old case files?

239
00:11:07,243 --> 00:11:09,061
All right, look...

240
00:11:09,071 --> 00:11:11,237
you lived as Kim for months.

241
00:11:11,247 --> 00:11:13,457
The moment you got
your memory back, you just...

242
00:11:13,467 --> 00:11:15,930
you dropped it like it never happened.

243
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:18,943
I-I can't.

244
00:11:20,082 --> 00:11:21,987
I can't go back to being a sidekick.

245
00:11:21,997 --> 00:11:23,423
- You're not a sidekick.
- Come on.

246
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:26,114
I'm only in this group at all
because of Penny.

247
00:11:26,609 --> 00:11:28,514
That's not true.

248
00:11:28,525 --> 00:11:30,474
- You and me...
- We're friends, yeah.

249
00:11:30,484 --> 00:11:33,433
And then we weren't,
and now we're what...

250
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,131
I don't know,
whatever you call it when...

251
00:11:35,141 --> 00:11:36,436
you have a lot of history

252
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,517
that made you two very different people.

253
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:42,670
I need my own path, Jules.

254
00:11:44,193 --> 00:11:46,316
I want my life to feel
like it's about me.

255
00:11:46,326 --> 00:11:48,274
No, I get that.

256
00:11:48,284 --> 00:11:50,935
And I am all for your personal growth.
It's just that we're...

257
00:11:50,946 --> 00:11:52,645
you know, we're kind of
under the gun here.

258
00:11:52,656 --> 00:11:55,586
You're under my roof,
hidden from the McAllistairs

259
00:11:55,596 --> 00:11:57,675
and the Library because I took
this place from Marina

260
00:11:57,685 --> 00:11:59,155
when everyone else wanted

261
00:11:59,165 --> 00:12:01,471
to hand her nuclear launch codes.

262
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:06,354
Look, I'll help, of course...

263
00:12:07,434 --> 00:12:11,210
when I can, in my way.

264
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,739
But for now...

265
00:12:13,701 --> 00:12:16,389
Sam left a few loose ends
I need to tie up.

266
00:12:25,408 --> 00:12:26,704
You're not my Postmate.

267
00:12:26,714 --> 00:12:28,706
I am the Baba Yaga.

268
00:12:28,716 --> 00:12:32,144
You live on my property
under my protection,

269
00:12:32,154 --> 00:12:34,581
and your rent is due.

270
00:12:34,591 --> 00:12:38,498
Okay, well, this isn't exactly my place.

271
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:40,544
Well, you're here now,

272
00:12:40,554 --> 00:12:43,634
and the list is clearly posted
on the premises.

273
00:12:43,644 --> 00:12:46,332
Wait, Marina's weird
grocery list on the fridge?

274
00:12:46,342 --> 00:12:47,594
It is not weird.

275
00:12:47,604 --> 00:12:49,509
You are weird.

276
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,697
You reek of nondairy creamer
and despair.

277
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,603
Okay, look, I don't have

278
00:12:56,613 --> 00:12:58,344
whatever it is that you're looking for.

279
00:12:58,354 --> 00:13:00,564
One Webster's Weeping Healer,

280
00:13:00,574 --> 00:13:03,045
one Totem of the Plump Pelican,

281
00:13:03,055 --> 00:13:05,090
and one Bag of Holding.

282
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,614
Pay what is owed in two days' time

283
00:13:07,624 --> 00:13:10,704
or wish I boiled you alive.

284
00:13:10,714 --> 00:13:12,358
The wench will explain.

285
00:13:12,368 --> 00:13:13,707
What?

286
00:13:20,637 --> 00:13:23,195
Holy shit, you have to pay her.

287
00:13:23,205 --> 00:13:24,588
"Her"? You mean you.

288
00:13:24,598 --> 00:13:26,198
Okay, what the fuck is happening?

289
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,547
I'm Bailey.

290
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:30,376
Sorry about the Baba Yaga. She
can be a little...

291
00:13:30,386 --> 00:13:32,770
The Baba's the spirit
of a vengeful Slavic witch

292
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,641
I channel when I need to collect rent

293
00:13:34,651 --> 00:13:36,556
or deal with a chatty Uber driver.

294
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,558
So if you don't want to be
her next meal,

295
00:13:38,568 --> 00:13:40,256
you should give her what she wants.

296
00:13:40,266 --> 00:13:41,692
Ooh, stressful.

297
00:13:41,702 --> 00:13:44,564
Where am I supposed to find...

298
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:46,131
Wait a minute.

299
00:13:46,141 --> 00:13:47,437
Is the...

300
00:13:47,447 --> 00:13:50,276
The Totem of the Plump Pelican.

301
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,355
Wait, this thing?

302
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:53,921
Oh, yeah, that's it.

303
00:13:53,931 --> 00:13:56,315
Oh. Marina must have found it.

304
00:13:56,325 --> 00:13:57,868
I just thought it was some
ugly paperweight.

305
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,666
Shh, don't insult it.

306
00:13:59,676 --> 00:14:01,277
It reacts.

307
00:14:01,287 --> 00:14:03,583
So two more to go.

308
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,324
Oh, shit.

309
00:14:05,334 --> 00:14:06,412
She's coming back.

310
00:14:09,643 --> 00:14:11,330
Pay me what is owed,

311
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,300
or I will boil your marrow
into soup, peasant.

312
00:14:16,171 --> 00:14:17,607
See you Thursday.

313
00:14:27,046 --> 00:14:29,068
I'm looking for a guy called "Lovelady."

314
00:14:29,079 --> 00:14:32,387
Heard he has office hours here.

315
00:14:38,231 --> 00:14:39,484
What is this?

316
00:14:39,494 --> 00:14:41,840
- Some kind of flashlight spell?
- Isik.

317
00:14:52,245 --> 00:14:53,802
- Jesus.
- Whoa!

318
00:14:53,812 --> 00:14:55,412
Satisfied?

319
00:14:55,422 --> 00:14:58,420
What the hell was that? I never want
to see the floor of a bar that bright.

320
00:14:58,431 --> 00:14:59,596
Pete?

321
00:15:00,153 --> 00:15:03,016
Wait, you're Lovelady?

322
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,714
Oh, shit.

323
00:15:04,725 --> 00:15:06,325
Kady.

324
00:15:06,336 --> 00:15:07,779
It's been a while.

325
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:10,392
Last time I saw you,
you were with Marina.

326
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:13,226
We parted ways. It was mutual.

327
00:15:13,237 --> 00:15:15,442
Mm, I'm sure.

328
00:15:16,995 --> 00:15:19,814
- So "Lovelady," huh?
- It's a title.

329
00:15:19,824 --> 00:15:22,860
When one guy's done with it, he
passes it on to the next guy,

330
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,837
kind of like "Dread Pirate
Roberts" or "Senator."

331
00:15:25,848 --> 00:15:28,818
That's not how Senators work.

332
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:30,216
Whatever.

333
00:15:30,226 --> 00:15:32,087
The guy who was "Lovelady before me"

334
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,481
is an Earl with a private island.

335
00:15:34,491 --> 00:15:36,222
People respect the shit out of me.

336
00:15:36,232 --> 00:15:39,138
It's a great sign when
you have to tell people that.

337
00:15:39,148 --> 00:15:43,359
Did you come here looking
for my help or...?

338
00:15:43,369 --> 00:15:44,961
Sorry.

339
00:15:47,373 --> 00:15:50,845
Here's a list.

340
00:15:50,855 --> 00:15:52,412
I heard you can find things.

341
00:15:52,422 --> 00:15:54,762
Interesting stuff.

342
00:15:54,772 --> 00:15:55,846
Specific.

343
00:15:55,857 --> 00:15:58,026
Landlord issue.

344
00:15:58,036 --> 00:15:59,375
Have you considered moving?

345
00:15:59,385 --> 00:16:01,856
The place has special features.

346
00:16:01,866 --> 00:16:04,075
It just turns out it's courtesy
of a-a witch...

347
00:16:04,085 --> 00:16:05,990
uh, Baba-something.

348
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,731
You mean the Baba Yaga?

349
00:16:07,741 --> 00:16:11,213
- You know her?
- Just by reputation.

350
00:16:11,223 --> 00:16:13,346
Hey, if I help you,

351
00:16:13,356 --> 00:16:17,350
in lieu of my usual fee,
I want you to introduce me.

352
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,831
- Not sure she's your type.
- She's got great taste.

353
00:16:20,841 --> 00:16:23,892
This could open up
a whole new avenue for me.

354
00:16:25,628 --> 00:16:27,761
Yeah, fine, whatever. You'll help?

355
00:16:29,459 --> 00:16:30,928
One more thing.

356
00:16:30,938 --> 00:16:33,366
Um, do you still see Julia?

357
00:16:33,376 --> 00:16:35,455
Don't be a creep, Pete.

358
00:16:35,465 --> 00:16:37,423
Where are we going?

359
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,112
Black Market.

360
00:16:41,122 --> 00:16:44,246
So Kady's moved on.

361
00:16:44,256 --> 00:16:46,988
I mean, not with Pete, just...

362
00:16:46,998 --> 00:16:48,468
I know what you mean,

363
00:16:48,478 --> 00:16:51,253
and I'm happy for her.

364
00:16:51,263 --> 00:16:53,255
You don't look happy.

365
00:16:53,265 --> 00:16:55,953
So is there some sort of connection

366
00:16:55,963 --> 00:16:58,642
I'm supposed to be seeing between Kady,

367
00:16:58,653 --> 00:17:01,567
Zelda, Fen...

368
00:17:01,578 --> 00:17:03,265
You'll see.

369
00:17:03,275 --> 00:17:08,923
Alice's book had been revised, but
Alice had changed the ending.

370
00:17:08,933 --> 00:17:11,142
- Well?
- Apparently, Alice feels

371
00:17:11,152 --> 00:17:13,232
magic has caused her
nothing but trouble.

372
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:16,496
She goes on to live out an entirely
civilian life in Portland.

373
00:17:16,506 --> 00:17:19,063
She just got a job at a craft brewery,

374
00:17:19,073 --> 00:17:20,500
and a Shih Tzu.

375
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,284
You look a little surprised.

376
00:17:22,294 --> 00:17:24,286
Does that not sound like her?

377
00:17:24,296 --> 00:17:27,115
The choice is unexpected, but...

378
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:30,423
wouldn't be the first time
she walked away from magic.

379
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:32,294
Great, then.

380
00:17:32,304 --> 00:17:35,558
Nick is still at large, so we'll
keep our trackers in circulation,

381
00:17:35,568 --> 00:17:38,387
but I think we can close
the book on Alice Quinn.

382
00:17:38,397 --> 00:17:40,214
It's funny...

383
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,768
I'd always thought she was a cat person.

384
00:17:45,012 --> 00:17:47,527
Never seen her before. Sorry.

385
00:17:47,537 --> 00:17:50,138
She would be a new hire.

386
00:17:50,148 --> 00:17:52,314
We're not hiring right now.

387
00:17:52,324 --> 00:17:54,679
In fact, we've had to
let some people go.

388
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:57,179
Designer hops are getting expensive.

389
00:18:03,335 --> 00:18:04,744
Well?

390
00:18:05,205 --> 00:18:07,937
Alice is inside, as her book said.

391
00:18:07,948 --> 00:18:10,103
Hmm. Good riddance, book tart.

392
00:18:10,864 --> 00:18:13,302
Let's go get some doughnuts.

393
00:18:17,836 --> 00:18:19,697
This is the Black Market?

394
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,744
- It's so...
- Normal?

395
00:18:21,754 --> 00:18:23,528
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

396
00:18:23,538 --> 00:18:26,226
You'd be surprised
what you can find in here.

397
00:18:26,236 --> 00:18:27,498
Even Deweys.

398
00:18:27,509 --> 00:18:29,795
Wait, I thought you had to
have a Library card for that?

399
00:18:29,805 --> 00:18:32,189
Yeah, well, the Library
should know better

400
00:18:32,199 --> 00:18:34,365
than to give unlimited black cards

401
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:37,357
to rich druggie dickbags that
trade them in for lap dances.

402
00:18:37,368 --> 00:18:39,500
Oh, so you give lap dances, huh?

403
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,935
Selectively.

404
00:18:42,296 --> 00:18:44,636
Okay, so that is Whitley.

405
00:18:44,646 --> 00:18:47,726
If she does not have a Bag of
Holding, she'll have a line on one.

406
00:18:47,736 --> 00:18:49,293
What, you're not gonna introduce me?

407
00:18:49,303 --> 00:18:51,687
Well, I may have had sex with her

408
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,166
and never called her again.

409
00:18:53,176 --> 00:18:54,549
Classy.

410
00:18:55,721 --> 00:18:58,476
Hey, I'm looking for a Bag of Holding...

411
00:18:58,486 --> 00:19:00,652
whatever that is.

412
00:19:00,662 --> 00:19:02,698
It's a "Doctor Who" kind of thing.

413
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,438
A bag that's bigger on the inside.

414
00:19:04,448 --> 00:19:06,310
Actually, it's a D&D thing.

415
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,703
Yeah, I don't do nerd shit.

416
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:11,000
Expensive taste for someone who
doesn't know what they're asking for.

417
00:19:12,761 --> 00:19:13,976
I can pay.

418
00:19:15,546 --> 00:19:17,538
Charisma Cufflinks...

419
00:19:17,548 --> 00:19:19,540
for a Bag of Holding?

420
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:22,326
Come back when you're serious.

421
00:19:29,648 --> 00:19:32,510
Kraken tentacles... helps build muscle.

422
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,554
I'm paleo.

423
00:19:33,565 --> 00:19:36,074
Cavemen didn't eat kraken,
so I don't eat kraken.

424
00:19:38,922 --> 00:19:41,175
What'll you give me for these?

425
00:19:50,756 --> 00:19:52,486
Aleister Crowley's ashes.

426
00:19:52,496 --> 00:19:54,358
Not bad.

427
00:19:54,368 --> 00:19:56,675
Worth a Bag of Holding?

428
00:20:02,463 --> 00:20:04,215
Thanks.

429
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:10,330
What the hell, Pete? I searched
the whole goddamn market for you.

430
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:12,376
Kady, great news.

431
00:20:12,386 --> 00:20:15,110
I found Gordy. Gordy's my, um...

432
00:20:16,433 --> 00:20:18,480
- He's great.
- Hi, Kaitlin.

433
00:20:18,491 --> 00:20:19,700
Kady.

434
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:23,859
You were supposed to be looking for
the Webster's Weeping Whatever,

435
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,259
not getting wasted.

436
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,651
¿Por qué no los dos, mamacita?

437
00:20:27,662 --> 00:20:31,039
I'll have you know Gordy is a doctor.

438
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,409
- Well...
- For animals.

439
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:36,268
You know, for dogs and cats.

440
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:37,749
Don't sell yourself short, all right?

441
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,795
- That's a real doctor.
- Ok... shh, shh, shh. Not helpful.

442
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:43,886
Yes, helpful, because Gordy knows

443
00:20:43,896 --> 00:20:46,627
where to get that thing
that you're looking for.

444
00:20:46,637 --> 00:20:49,500
The thing. The creepy doll
that cries healing tears.

445
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,720
Webster's Weeping Healer.

446
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:54,810
Got a buddy, Duke... exotic-bird guy.

447
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,899
So his cockatoo caught bumblefoot...

448
00:20:56,909 --> 00:20:58,335
Okay, shh.

449
00:20:58,345 --> 00:20:59,640
Duke has the doll?

450
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,033
Well, yeah.

451
00:21:01,043 --> 00:21:02,948
Okay, where can I find him?

452
00:21:06,614 --> 00:21:10,009
Hello? Anybody there?

453
00:21:13,621 --> 00:21:15,565
I'm guessing no one's home.

454
00:21:22,978 --> 00:21:25,459
Well, that explains it.

455
00:21:27,297 --> 00:21:30,420
No sign of blunt-force trauma
or defensive wounds.

456
00:21:30,431 --> 00:21:32,119
Doesn't look like foul play.

457
00:21:32,129 --> 00:21:34,121
Okay, Mariska Hargitay.

458
00:21:34,131 --> 00:21:37,221
Just find the doll, will you?

459
00:21:50,103 --> 00:21:53,009
No, bad touch!

460
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:55,359
Get off!

461
00:21:55,369 --> 00:21:56,970
God, I hate this place.

462
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,798
But...

463
00:21:58,808 --> 00:22:00,234
found the doll.

464
00:22:01,854 --> 00:22:03,280
Healing tears or no,

465
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:05,902
I would not keep this thing in my house.

466
00:22:08,426 --> 00:22:10,070
Really, Pete?

467
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,072
What? He's not using it.

468
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:14,345
You're disgusting.

469
00:22:28,402 --> 00:22:31,047
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

470
00:22:36,326 --> 00:22:37,795
Jesus, Fen!

471
00:22:37,806 --> 00:22:39,798
Why the hell are you lurking
in a dark pantry?

472
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:41,037
Waiting for you.

473
00:22:41,048 --> 00:22:43,257
Your soufflé fell.
You're gonna bake a new one.

474
00:22:43,268 --> 00:22:45,836
- How did you...
- Dreamt it.

475
00:22:47,773 --> 00:22:51,201
You're worried Margo is gonna
blow talks with Lady Pike.

476
00:22:51,211 --> 00:22:54,552
Wait, again with the alpaca lady?

477
00:22:54,562 --> 00:22:56,076
Sorry.

478
00:22:56,086 --> 00:22:58,165
Uh, some of these pages
are out of order.

479
00:22:58,175 --> 00:22:59,608
Just keep reading.

480
00:22:59,619 --> 00:23:01,690
But really, you're worried
that you and she have

481
00:23:01,701 --> 00:23:03,580
a true connection and you're
going to screw it up,

482
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:06,050
- so you're stress-baking.
- Okay, ouch.

483
00:23:06,061 --> 00:23:08,958
And that's a weirdly specific
and accurate dream.

484
00:23:08,969 --> 00:23:10,829
I also dreamt of dancing ears of corn,

485
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:13,093
and then the farmers reported a surplus.

486
00:23:13,103 --> 00:23:14,524
I dreamt about what Tick really does

487
00:23:14,535 --> 00:23:16,429
with all those peaches
he steals from the kitchen,

488
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,663
which is surprisingly not gross.

489
00:23:18,673 --> 00:23:21,144
And they've all come true.

490
00:23:21,154 --> 00:23:24,234
Prophetic dreams could mean
a lot of things.

491
00:23:24,244 --> 00:23:26,323
Uh, maybe you're a psychic

492
00:23:26,333 --> 00:23:28,804
or someone cast some kind
of spell on you.

493
00:23:28,814 --> 00:23:32,329
Or... or it's Fillory, and maybe
you just ate some messed-up fruit.

494
00:23:32,339 --> 00:23:34,288
You think someone did this to me?

495
00:23:34,298 --> 00:23:36,072
If you're worried, next time it happens

496
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:38,205
just poke around the dream a little.

497
00:23:38,215 --> 00:23:40,250
Poke with what? A knife?

498
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:43,397
No. No knives. Lucid dreaming.

499
00:23:43,408 --> 00:23:45,144
They teach it first semester
at Brakebills.

500
00:23:45,155 --> 00:23:46,691
The second you realize you're dreaming,

501
00:23:46,701 --> 00:23:48,389
you can take control of your dream.

502
00:23:48,399 --> 00:23:49,781
You don't even need magic to do it.

503
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:51,870
Just close your eyes...

504
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,786
Breathe, and try to push your finger

505
00:23:54,796 --> 00:23:56,571
through your other hand.

506
00:23:56,581 --> 00:23:58,099
Everything freezes.

507
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:01,319
Anything not supposed to be there,
that's when you'll be able to tell.

508
00:24:02,369 --> 00:24:04,361
Alice wasn't where
her book said she'd be.

509
00:24:04,371 --> 00:24:07,364
I suspect she sabotaged it.

510
00:24:07,374 --> 00:24:10,498
And now I've lied to my colleagues.

511
00:24:10,508 --> 00:24:13,439
If I don't find her
before they find out...

512
00:24:14,338 --> 00:24:16,427
Sounds like a personal problem.

513
00:24:18,255 --> 00:24:21,117
Henry, please.

514
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:22,814
I'm trusting you.

515
00:24:22,824 --> 00:24:24,729
What you mean is that you trust

516
00:24:24,739 --> 00:24:26,427
that I won't report this

517
00:24:26,437 --> 00:24:30,213
- because it'd be worse for Alice.
- We both want to spare her that.

518
00:24:30,223 --> 00:24:31,823
If you could just tell me
where she is...

519
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:35,740
I comply with every request...

520
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:39,189
all your red tape
and your triplicate bullshit.

521
00:24:41,756 --> 00:24:45,108
This is your mess.
Do not drag me into it.

522
00:25:09,436 --> 00:25:11,689
Harriet?

523
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,635
_

524
00:25:16,511 --> 00:25:18,035
_

525
00:25:38,639 --> 00:25:42,148
I don't think an ancient Slavic
witch is gonna want a mojito.

526
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:43,841
Right, um...

527
00:25:43,852 --> 00:25:45,583
something vodka-based?

528
00:25:45,594 --> 00:25:47,586
Are you actually nervous?

529
00:25:47,597 --> 00:25:49,328
Baba Yaga's a really big deal

530
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,244
in my line of work, and...

531
00:25:51,255 --> 00:25:54,117
First impressions...

532
00:25:54,128 --> 00:25:57,426
- What was I saying?
- Pete, your arm.

533
00:25:59,747 --> 00:26:03,915
that molest-y hand gave me the clap.

534
00:26:03,925 --> 00:26:05,884
Oh, shit.

535
00:26:07,089 --> 00:26:08,925
Looks like a bad spell interaction.

536
00:26:08,936 --> 00:26:11,430
Something's clashing with one
of his personal enchantments.

537
00:26:11,441 --> 00:26:12,649
Which personal enchantment?

538
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,565
I don't know. They're personal.

539
00:26:14,576 --> 00:26:16,959
Hedge spells, you know,
they're off the street at best.

540
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,744
They got a lot of rough edges.

541
00:26:18,754 --> 00:26:20,951
There's really no telling
if they'll play nice together

542
00:26:20,962 --> 00:26:22,461
until, well, they don't.

543
00:26:22,472 --> 00:26:25,295
Whatever killed Duke is killing him.

544
00:26:25,306 --> 00:26:27,864
So help him, or I break your jaw.

545
00:26:27,874 --> 00:26:30,170
Look, the only human
diagnostic spell I know

546
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,390
costs magic, and I'm a little
Dewey-light at the mo...

547
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,349
Please don't break my jaw.

548
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,046
Fine.

549
00:26:36,056 --> 00:26:38,353
Pete has one he took off
your friend Duke.

550
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:41,878
Wait. Wait, you said
something's clashing with Pete.

551
00:26:42,905 --> 00:26:45,360
- Like what?
- Like a cursed object.

552
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,318
I once treated a horse for strangles.

553
00:26:47,328 --> 00:26:49,407
Turns out jockey's riding crop
interacted badly

554
00:26:49,417 --> 00:26:52,018
with a hoof-protection spell, so...

555
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:54,064
Does Pete carry a riding crop?

556
00:26:54,074 --> 00:26:56,762
Okay, maybe just look at this.

557
00:26:58,121 --> 00:26:59,504
Cobalt.

558
00:26:59,514 --> 00:27:00,914
Don't touch that shit.

559
00:27:00,925 --> 00:27:03,160
Not really planning to
now that you licked it.

560
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:06,032
What? It's more accurate than lenses.
You can taste cobalt.

561
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:07,512
It's used in most tracking spells.

562
00:27:07,522 --> 00:27:09,035
- "Tracking spells"?
- Mm-hmm.

563
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:12,038
I put them on pets. This one tastes
like a real expensive Searcher.

564
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:14,127
You hold it long enough,
it kind of sends out

565
00:27:14,137 --> 00:27:15,912
a signal to whoever cast it.

566
00:27:15,922 --> 00:27:18,523
Wait, a-a signal to wh... who?

567
00:27:18,533 --> 00:27:19,706
Aliens.

568
00:27:19,717 --> 00:27:22,266
I was thinking more
like who makes Deweys.

569
00:27:22,276 --> 00:27:24,268
- The Library.
- Oh, yeah.

570
00:27:24,278 --> 00:27:26,052
That makes more sense.

571
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:28,272
Who's the Library looking for?

572
00:27:28,282 --> 00:27:30,143
Oh, I can think of a few people.

573
00:27:30,153 --> 00:27:32,972
Wait, how many hedges have
these personal enchantments?

574
00:27:32,982 --> 00:27:35,061
Pretty much everybody.

575
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:36,411
Shit.

576
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:40,153
- Take off all of Pete's, now.
- What are you gonna do?

577
00:27:40,163 --> 00:27:41,938
I'm gonna warn everybody.

578
00:27:41,948 --> 00:27:46,029
Wait a second. So the Library's
responsible for hedge witches dying?

579
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,074
Yeah, but they don't know that yet.

580
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:49,525
Spoiler alert.

581
00:27:49,536 --> 00:27:51,861
Zelda had some other things
on her mind at the time.

582
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:53,384
Her dead daughter.

583
00:27:53,394 --> 00:27:55,589
Wait, is she, like, down here?

584
00:27:56,917 --> 00:27:59,434
I thought you didn't like spoilers.

585
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:01,261
Look, I'm sorry you see dead people,

586
00:28:01,271 --> 00:28:03,089
but that is an incredibly stupid idea.

587
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:05,440
She's not dead. Ghosts don't bleed.

588
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,421
I don't know how, but she could
be alive stuck in there.

589
00:28:08,432 --> 00:28:10,444
That's insane... and impossible.

590
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:11,924
It's the Mirror Realm.

591
00:28:11,934 --> 00:28:14,536
We don't know what's impossible.

592
00:28:14,546 --> 00:28:16,581
It's not as complicated
as a mirror bridge.

593
00:28:16,591 --> 00:28:18,975
We just need to open a door
to the place between mirrors.

594
00:28:18,985 --> 00:28:20,585
Listen, Zelds, if you told me you wanted

595
00:28:20,595 --> 00:28:22,606
to finger-paint your blood
so you could take a walk

596
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:25,024
in the crazy dimension
I would say, "Free country."

597
00:28:25,034 --> 00:28:26,945
But this is my blood.

598
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:29,464
I can't do this...

599
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:31,074
without your help.

600
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,467
Yes, I know that.

601
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,643
- And I'm leaving.
- She's my daughter.

602
00:28:37,351 --> 00:28:38,653
Harriet...

603
00:28:39,724 --> 00:28:41,171
who's older than you?

604
00:28:41,181 --> 00:28:44,392
Our relationship is complicated.

605
00:28:44,402 --> 00:28:46,002
Clearly.

606
00:28:46,012 --> 00:28:48,308
You smashed the mirror.

607
00:28:48,318 --> 00:28:50,180
You...

608
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,442
trapped her there.

609
00:28:51,452 --> 00:28:52,661
I was doing my job.

610
00:28:52,671 --> 00:28:56,012
I can't...

611
00:28:56,022 --> 00:28:59,537
Live with myself if I don't
find a way to help her.

612
00:29:02,985 --> 00:29:04,247
Please.

613
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,062
Christ.

614
00:29:10,252 --> 00:29:12,201
I'm gonna regret this, aren't I?

615
00:29:15,302 --> 00:29:18,904
- Did you juice the beets?
- Oh, I juiced the beets.

616
00:29:18,914 --> 00:29:20,645
I told you I would juice the beets.

617
00:29:20,655 --> 00:29:23,648
- Why wouldn't I juice the beets?
- Don't make this about us.

618
00:29:23,658 --> 00:29:25,345
Wait, did I miss something?

619
00:29:25,355 --> 00:29:29,959
I thought Margo and Josh were an
unlikely yet heartwarming thing.

620
00:29:29,969 --> 00:29:32,396
No, this is after
the Lady Pike incident.

621
00:29:32,406 --> 00:29:35,051
Margo called Josh a sweater boy.

622
00:29:35,061 --> 00:29:36,356
Forget it.

623
00:29:36,366 --> 00:29:37,923
Pay attention to Fen.

624
00:29:37,933 --> 00:29:39,621
How's this shit work?

625
00:29:39,631 --> 00:29:44,016
Pour it gently
onto the lizard, Your Majesty.

626
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,431
Jesus lizard-fucking Christ!

627
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:05,439
Does this feel like a weird
sort of dream to any of you?

628
00:30:10,096 --> 00:30:12,577
All right, maybe I can control this.

629
00:30:18,452 --> 00:30:22,620
Ember's balls. This is a dream.

630
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:26,504
Okay, okay. Stop talking to
yourself and, uh, look around.

631
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:30,106
Hey!

632
00:30:30,116 --> 00:30:31,237
Who are you?

633
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:33,109
Wait, no! Stop, please!

634
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:34,589
Freeze! Freeze!

635
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:36,504
Hey, hey, stop!

636
00:30:36,514 --> 00:30:38,244
Freeze! Green Lady!

637
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:39,332
Hold up!

638
00:30:39,342 --> 00:30:41,170
Hey, Green Lady, come back!

639
00:30:45,305 --> 00:30:47,960
Umber's ass, this is getting annoying.

640
00:30:58,492 --> 00:31:00,528
Hey, wait!

641
00:31:00,538 --> 00:31:02,268
Wait, I just want to talk!

642
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:04,444
Why am I having these stupid dreams?

643
00:31:04,454 --> 00:31:06,055
Oh, no.

644
00:31:06,065 --> 00:31:07,622
The lizard.

645
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:10,494
You pour it gently
onto the lizard, Your Majesty.

646
00:31:10,504 --> 00:31:12,409
Wait, stop! It'll catch fire!

647
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:14,019
The fuck?

648
00:31:14,029 --> 00:31:17,022
I saw the lizard blow up

649
00:31:17,032 --> 00:31:19,459
when Rafe...

650
00:31:19,469 --> 00:31:21,113
Antidote.

651
00:31:21,123 --> 00:31:23,072
What is she talking about?

652
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:24,639
Perhaps she's mad with grief

653
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:27,076
over the loss of King Eliot,
Your Majesty.

654
00:31:27,086 --> 00:31:28,556
I assure you, all the animals

655
00:31:28,566 --> 00:31:31,036
have responded quite positively
to the antidote.

656
00:31:31,046 --> 00:31:33,343
Well, this one definitely won't.

657
00:31:33,353 --> 00:31:36,041
Foosh. Fried Lizard.

658
00:31:36,051 --> 00:31:38,619
And where are you getting
this information?

659
00:31:42,536 --> 00:31:44,049
I...

660
00:31:44,059 --> 00:31:45,616
I dreamt it.

661
00:31:45,626 --> 00:31:48,841
Fen has been having
kind of prophetic dreams.

662
00:31:48,852 --> 00:31:51,381
She knew my soufflé was gonna
fall before that ever happened.

663
00:31:51,392 --> 00:31:52,867
It's a stupid fucking premonition.

664
00:31:52,878 --> 00:31:55,537
You want to risk the life of your
lizard, or is that a relationship

665
00:31:55,548 --> 00:31:58,673
- you're willing to set fire to as well?
- Oh, I'll fucking fry this lizard.

666
00:31:58,683 --> 00:32:00,370
Okay, can we... can we focus
for one minute?

667
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,536
- Sure.
- Yes.

668
00:32:01,547 --> 00:32:02,677
- Fine.
- Let's.

669
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:03,852
- Cool.
- Great.

670
00:32:03,862 --> 00:32:05,549
Okay.

671
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:08,552
Say I don't dose
Newt Scamander with beet juice.

672
00:32:08,562 --> 00:32:11,642
How the shit am I supposed
to get his wrinkly ass talking?

673
00:32:11,652 --> 00:32:13,513
I don't know, but I have an idea

674
00:32:13,523 --> 00:32:16,516
of where to look for answers.

675
00:32:16,526 --> 00:32:18,257
I lucid-dreamed.

676
00:32:18,267 --> 00:32:20,390
I saw a woman in a green hood.

677
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,697
She has to be the one
giving me premonitions.

678
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:24,220
Awesome. You got it working.

679
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:26,396
- A-plus.
- B-minus.

680
00:32:26,406 --> 00:32:27,876
Unless...

681
00:32:27,886 --> 00:32:30,661
you tell us where this green bitch went.

682
00:32:30,671 --> 00:32:33,838
Well, in my dream,
I chased her to this stream

683
00:32:33,848 --> 00:32:36,580
by the Fuschia Forest of Corian's Land.

684
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,756
Corian's Land...

685
00:32:38,766 --> 00:32:41,411
also known as Sloth's Bane.

686
00:32:41,421 --> 00:32:44,283
I don't know what everything
in my dreams means... mean.

687
00:32:44,293 --> 00:32:47,243
Anyway, I know that the answers

688
00:32:47,253 --> 00:32:49,593
to our questions...
answers lie... lay there?

689
00:32:49,603 --> 00:32:51,421
I-I'm not usually the one

690
00:32:51,431 --> 00:32:53,728
who gives the big speech,
so I'm... I'm going.

691
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:56,741
So that... that's happening.

692
00:33:05,255 --> 00:33:07,247
Gordy says "you're welcome."

693
00:33:07,258 --> 00:33:09,096
And he left you a bill.

694
00:33:09,107 --> 00:33:12,458
That guy puts a really
high value on his time.

695
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:17,322
Wait, did I miss the Baba Yaga?

696
00:33:17,332 --> 00:33:19,542
Well, you snooze, you lose.

697
00:33:19,552 --> 00:33:22,023
I wasn't snoozing, I was dying.

698
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:24,677
We got bigger fish to fry.

699
00:33:24,687 --> 00:33:26,331
I'll explain everything

700
00:33:26,341 --> 00:33:29,030
as soon as your hedge witch
friends get here.

701
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:33,904
I know every instinct is telling you

702
00:33:33,914 --> 00:33:36,689
not to trust me... or anyone.

703
00:33:36,699 --> 00:33:40,041
But someone put a tracker on this.

704
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:42,304
It's a complex, expensive,

705
00:33:42,314 --> 00:33:44,577
very high-level spell.

706
00:33:50,931 --> 00:33:52,357
It marked him.

707
00:33:52,367 --> 00:33:54,011
It looks like the Deweys you touched

708
00:33:54,021 --> 00:33:56,057
are doing the same to you.

709
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:58,146
If you have any enchantments running...

710
00:33:58,156 --> 00:33:59,582
anything you got in a safe house,

711
00:33:59,592 --> 00:34:01,453
anything homebrewed...
it could kill you...

712
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,982
just like it did to Duke
and almost did to Pete.

713
00:34:06,425 --> 00:34:08,460
She saved my life.

714
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:10,680
I trust her, and I vouch for her.

715
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:14,379
- Who did this?
- The Library.

716
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:16,294
They make the Deweys,
and they don't give a shit

717
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,601
about what happens to the hedges.

718
00:34:18,611 --> 00:34:21,343
They're trying to find someone,

719
00:34:21,353 --> 00:34:23,519
and we're just collateral damage.

720
00:34:23,529 --> 00:34:26,435
So ask yourselves...
if this is what they do

721
00:34:26,445 --> 00:34:29,438
when they're not even thinking about us,

722
00:34:29,448 --> 00:34:32,441
what happens when they decide
we're a threat?

723
00:34:35,715 --> 00:34:37,620
Are we just gonna let people like them

724
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:39,709
tell us we're not important?

725
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:43,669
That we're just some side characters

726
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,456
in their fucked-up fascist plot?

727
00:34:47,466 --> 00:34:51,112
My mom was a hedge...

728
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:54,985
and she was killed by another hedge.

729
00:34:54,995 --> 00:34:57,640
You'd think that would
turn me against you.

730
00:35:00,479 --> 00:35:02,601
But it didn't.

731
00:35:02,611 --> 00:35:06,388
It just made me realize that
it doesn't have to be this way.

732
00:35:06,398 --> 00:35:08,999
If we could stop
screwing each other over

733
00:35:09,009 --> 00:35:11,219
long enough to work together,

734
00:35:11,229 --> 00:35:14,787
then it's not the Library's story.

735
00:35:14,797 --> 00:35:17,616
It's our story.

736
00:35:24,068 --> 00:35:25,146
Hey.

737
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:27,148
I have a buddy in Modesto.

738
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:30,107
He says there's a leaky
Library pipe there.

739
00:35:30,117 --> 00:35:32,804
I say we use it
to make those assholes pay.

740
00:35:32,815 --> 00:35:34,546
Look, I know
what you're going through...

741
00:35:34,556 --> 00:35:36,832
Do you? They kill your boyfriend?

742
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:38,691
Actually, yeah.

743
00:35:40,649 --> 00:35:43,077
Look, we'll figure out what to do next.

744
00:35:43,087 --> 00:35:44,339
I already know what to do.

745
00:35:44,349 --> 00:35:48,256
You do that, you're giving
them a reason to wipe us out.

746
00:35:48,266 --> 00:35:52,042
Please just get a little sleep.
We'll talk tomorrow.

747
00:35:52,052 --> 00:35:54,740
Hey, you're not alone, okay?

748
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:57,710
We'll figure this out together in
a way that feels right for you.

749
00:35:59,494 --> 00:36:01,312
Okay.

750
00:36:01,322 --> 00:36:03,194
Yeah, we can do that.

751
00:36:15,815 --> 00:36:19,548
It's a copy of our library, but wrong.

752
00:36:21,566 --> 00:36:24,074
I was gonna say a total mindfuck.

753
00:36:24,084 --> 00:36:25,775
Tomato, tomah-to.

754
00:36:28,871 --> 00:36:30,385
Oh, you go on.

755
00:36:30,395 --> 00:36:33,388
I'll just be here cutting myself
to keep our bloody exit open.

756
00:36:33,398 --> 00:36:35,661
Hey, just made a joke.

757
00:36:46,498 --> 00:36:48,533
Hello?

758
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:36,891
Where have you been?

759
00:38:36,902 --> 00:38:40,172
Your funhouse-mirror daughter
shanked me. We have to go.

760
00:38:40,183 --> 00:38:42,801
Those things weren't her. The real
Harriet could still be in here.

761
00:38:42,812 --> 00:38:45,280
- I can't just leave her.
- I hate to break it to you, love...

762
00:38:45,291 --> 00:38:47,217
she might still be in there,
but so are those monsters.

763
00:39:06,767 --> 00:39:07,888
An attack?

764
00:39:07,898 --> 00:39:09,325
On what branch?

765
00:39:09,335 --> 00:39:11,805
Modesto, California.

766
00:39:11,815 --> 00:39:14,243
We lost four Librarians.

767
00:39:14,253 --> 00:39:15,983
Hedge witches did it.

768
00:39:15,993 --> 00:39:18,029
But... but why?

769
00:39:20,911 --> 00:39:24,731
There was some fallout
from your tracker coins.

770
00:39:24,741 --> 00:39:26,951
It's not your fault.

771
00:39:26,961 --> 00:39:29,127
Just unforeseen interaction.

772
00:39:29,137 --> 00:39:31,303
Several hedges died.

773
00:39:31,313 --> 00:39:36,221
The whole point of doing this was
to avoid having to hurt anyone.

774
00:39:36,231 --> 00:39:37,962
I should have been here.

775
00:39:37,972 --> 00:39:39,659
You can't blame yourself.

776
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:42,923
If anything, today we learned
the true danger we're in

777
00:39:42,933 --> 00:39:45,893
and that your trackers
might provide a solution.

778
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:49,365
What do you mean?

779
00:39:49,375 --> 00:39:51,802
Complications aside...

780
00:39:51,812 --> 00:39:53,799
the idea is sound.

781
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:57,764
Put whatever we have
into circulation among them.

782
00:39:57,774 --> 00:40:01,159
We keep Modesto from happening again.

783
00:40:01,169 --> 00:40:04,380
Are you suggesting
we kill hedge witches?

784
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:06,817
I am suggesting
that we keep an eye on them.

785
00:40:06,827 --> 00:40:08,778
To "protect the flame of knowledge"

786
00:40:08,789 --> 00:40:12,093
from ever being extinguished,
no matter the cost."

787
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,663
I don't know what to say.

788
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,962
This is an awesome responsibility.

789
00:40:22,973 --> 00:40:25,096
You and I both know that,
but who is better suited

790
00:40:25,106 --> 00:40:28,708
to bear that responsibility
than The Order?

791
00:40:30,416 --> 00:40:33,147
There is no one I trust more deeply

792
00:40:33,157 --> 00:40:36,368
to be fair and right than you.

793
00:40:43,037 --> 00:40:45,072
Alice.

794
00:40:45,082 --> 00:40:48,784
I can't stay long. I-I cast a spell to
keep the Library from eavesdropping,

795
00:40:48,795 --> 00:40:50,668
but it won't last.

796
00:40:51,872 --> 00:40:53,516
I need your help.

797
00:40:53,526 --> 00:40:55,909
They have my friend Sheila.

798
00:40:55,919 --> 00:40:57,921
I know.

799
00:41:00,446 --> 00:41:02,220
Hello, Ms. Quinn.

800
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:04,135
Alice, please.

801
00:41:04,145 --> 00:41:06,398
Nothing will happen to you here.

802
00:41:06,408 --> 00:41:08,473
Zelda wants to talk.

803
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:10,978
Why?

804
00:41:13,415 --> 00:41:15,243
I need your help.

805
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:19,019
I think I've seen enough.

806
00:41:19,029 --> 00:41:23,249
To counteract a lifetime
of cis-het frat-bro bias?

807
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,682
- I-I doubt it.
- Okay.

808
00:41:25,693 --> 00:41:28,289
So tell me, what was I supposed
to take from that?

809
00:41:28,299 --> 00:41:30,901
Zelda doesn't know it yet,
but what she just set in motion

810
00:41:30,911 --> 00:41:33,164
is going to change the Library forever.

811
00:41:33,174 --> 00:41:35,819
Same with Fen and Fillory,

812
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:38,909
Kady and all of magic.

813
00:41:38,919 --> 00:41:40,998
When you file people away as sidekicks,

814
00:41:41,008 --> 00:41:43,783
you don't realize
their importance to the story,

815
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:46,003
and this story belongs

816
00:41:46,013 --> 00:41:48,962
to a lot more people than you think.

817
00:41:48,972 --> 00:41:51,051
Where to shelve a book,

818
00:41:51,061 --> 00:41:52,792
it's not a little thing.

819
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:55,229
You're telling the world what to value,

820
00:41:55,239 --> 00:41:58,259
who to value.

821
00:41:58,939 --> 00:42:01,410
You get our responsibility here?

822
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,281
Well said.

823
00:42:03,291 --> 00:42:05,979
I think you've earned
the right to move up.

824
00:42:05,989 --> 00:42:09,243
Excuse me?

825
00:42:09,253 --> 00:42:12,856
I know so much about you
and your friends,

826
00:42:12,866 --> 00:42:16,043
but you never asked me how I died.

827
00:42:17,479 --> 00:42:19,471
O-okay, um...

828
00:42:19,481 --> 00:42:22,518
- How did you die?
- Arrow to the chest...

829
00:42:22,528 --> 00:42:24,171
during the Crusades.

830
00:42:24,181 --> 00:42:25,303
"The Crusades"?

831
00:42:25,313 --> 00:42:27,392
1,000 years ago?

832
00:42:27,402 --> 00:42:29,002
We really thought the story

833
00:42:29,012 --> 00:42:32,136
was all about white guys
back then, believe me.

834
00:42:32,146 --> 00:42:34,965
And I'm not new at all.

835
00:42:34,975 --> 00:42:38,969
I'm actually
your supervisor's supervisor.

836
00:42:38,979 --> 00:42:41,493
So you're my boss.

837
00:42:41,503 --> 00:42:44,365
I fully see the irony of a white
guy giving you this test,

838
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:48,631
but ladies upstairs love a
twist, so they always send me.

839
00:42:48,641 --> 00:42:50,154
Send you to what?

840
00:42:50,164 --> 00:42:52,025
To promote you.

841
00:42:52,035 --> 00:42:54,550
You're clearly ready for the next level.

842
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,986
Which is?

843
00:42:55,996 --> 00:42:58,075
Secrets Taken to the Grave.

844
00:42:58,085 --> 00:43:00,251
You're gonna collect them.

845
00:43:00,261 --> 00:43:02,243
Congratulations.

846
00:43:03,482 --> 00:43:04,995
Thank you.

847
00:43:05,005 --> 00:43:09,173
Oh, and, um, I'm afraid we're gonna
need you to start right away.

00:43:27,331 --> 00:43:28,924
Hey.

850
00:43:29,995 --> 00:43:31,866
Been a while.

851
00:43:33,555 --> 00:43:35,514
Welcome to the Underworld.
