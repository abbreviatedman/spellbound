1
00:00:06,887 --> 00:00:09,234
Previously, on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,989
Look, just go while you still
have the chance.

3
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:16,419
The Library controls
the levels of ambient magic

4
00:00:16,429 --> 00:00:17,829
that flow through the pipes.

5
00:00:17,849 --> 00:00:19,349
This one has a leak.

6
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:24,739
Well, what's my Birthright,
you scaly shit?

7
00:00:24,749 --> 00:00:27,699
It's the talking animals.
They've all been struck dumb.

8
00:00:27,709 --> 00:00:30,699
- So what is this?
- I saved your fucking life, bitch.

9
00:00:30,709 --> 00:00:33,619
Margo, are you okay?

10
00:00:33,629 --> 00:00:35,559
You're just a brown-nose sweater boy

11
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:37,319
desperate to matter at all.

12
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:38,799
The other me, Sam,

13
00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:40,229
did whatever she thought was right,

14
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,919
regardless of what anybody else thought.

15
00:00:41,929 --> 00:00:44,369
This contract initiates
our services in exchange for...

16
00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:46,889
"Unlimited manual and magical labor"?

17
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:50,129
"Bound in service to the Library
up to and after my death"?

18
00:00:50,139 --> 00:00:52,639
- Penny, where are you?
- I'm in the Underworld Library.

19
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:54,359
If you stay down here,

20
00:00:54,369 --> 00:00:56,819
you've got an amazing destiny
ahead of you.

21
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:21,839
Uh, excuse me?

22
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:23,189
Mr. Adiyodi?

23
00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:25,369
Come in. Have a seat.

24
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:27,109
Is...

25
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:29,979
Did I do something wrong?

26
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:31,829
I called you in to talk
about Matilda Fremont.

27
00:01:31,839 --> 00:01:33,639
You shelved her book yesterday

28
00:01:33,649 --> 00:01:35,809
under "Disappointing Prodigies"?

29
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:37,589
Oh, right.

30
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,689
Uh, mastered the flute at seven
but became a mediocre poet.

31
00:01:40,699 --> 00:01:42,029
Unremarkable.

32
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:43,729
Did you read her brother's book?

33
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:45,059
She saved his life...

34
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:47,169
pulled him out
of a self-destructive spiral,

35
00:01:47,179 --> 00:01:48,819
and he went on to become

36
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:51,569
one of the world's
greatest philanthropists.

37
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:53,869
I wouldn't call that "unremarkable."

38
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:59,369
Uh, okay. So is there section for,
uh, "Sisters of Generous Men"?

39
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:02,919
You've been in the Underworld branch,

40
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:04,879
- um, three weeks?
- Well...

41
00:02:04,889 --> 00:02:06,969
Yeah, when I died, all I cared about

42
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:10,889
was getting back up there,
and... and all this?

43
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:12,979
I didn't think it mattered...

44
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:16,589
where a book goes, who reads it.

45
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:19,328
Those books I lent you,
you get a chance to read them?

46
00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:20,599
Of course.

47
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,729
Well, I skimmed.

48
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:24,119
How far did you get?

49
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:26,039
Alice, uh, opened a pipe,

50
00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:28,469
accidentally helped blow up
the Modesto branch,

51
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:31,789
and Quentin played Pictionary
with a mummy.

52
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,039
Where would you file them?

53
00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:35,479
Quentin and Alice...

54
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,439
"Star-Crossed Romances," probably,

55
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:39,919
or "Well-Meaning Failures."

56
00:02:39,929 --> 00:02:42,089
- What about the others?
- Oh...

57
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:45,049
"Side Characters in Epic Quests."

58
00:02:45,059 --> 00:02:46,579
I'm a side character?

59
00:02:46,589 --> 00:02:48,269
Look, no offense.

60
00:02:48,279 --> 00:02:51,409
It's just... Quentin's the center
of the whole thing.

61
00:02:51,429 --> 00:02:53,469
He's the one that knows everybody.

62
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:55,149
He's the one the little
British girl picked

63
00:02:55,169 --> 00:02:57,109
to save the world.

64
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:59,759
Or he's the one that looks like you.

65
00:02:59,769 --> 00:03:00,969
Not fair.

66
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:04,249
Todd looks like me.
He's not the center of shit.

67
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:05,539
But he could be.

68
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:09,819
All I'm saying is you think you've
seen stories like this before,

69
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:12,169
so you can guess
what's going to happen...

70
00:03:12,179 --> 00:03:15,169
who's important and who isn't.

71
00:03:15,179 --> 00:03:18,259
But that's because you are
trapped in your POV.

72
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:22,179
You have a classic case of
White Male Protagonism, Derek,

73
00:03:22,189 --> 00:03:25,309
and a Librarian simply can't have that.

74
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:28,049
But that's why these books
are so important.

75
00:03:28,059 --> 00:03:29,709
They're such a gift.

76
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:33,969
They... they can allow you
to see other points of view.

77
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:36,579
And once you start seeing that,

78
00:03:36,589 --> 00:03:39,799
you'll find that the story
doesn't end the way you think,

79
00:03:39,809 --> 00:03:43,589
and the most important characters
aren't who you expect.

80
00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:50,949
Remember back before
all the stuff in Modesto

81
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,599
when Alice first escaped
from the Library?

82
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,169
Oh, dear.

83
00:03:56,179 --> 00:03:57,869
I'm telling you, I saw

84
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:00,829
a reindeer-driven sleigh fly away.

85
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:02,649
Alice and Nick are gone.

86
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:03,829
This is not funny.

87
00:04:03,839 --> 00:04:07,529
I'm not laughing... now.

88
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,359
- I mean...
- Lets discuss next steps.

89
00:04:09,369 --> 00:04:11,879
Mm, we should wait for Everett.
He'll know how to...

90
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:15,749
Oh, he'll agree with me when I say
that Alice Quinn was your project.

91
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:18,799
Holding her here was a mistake.
We aren't jailers.

92
00:04:18,809 --> 00:04:20,669
What would you have done?

93
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:22,639
Alice broke her deal with us.

94
00:04:22,649 --> 00:04:26,899
She tried to turn off all of magic.
That has to have consequences.

95
00:04:26,909 --> 00:04:29,679
Our mission is to preserve
the knowledge of magic.

96
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:33,099
Alice Quinn is an existential
threat to that knowledge.

97
00:04:33,109 --> 00:04:35,899
Are you suggesting that
we should have killed her...

98
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,909
And Santa Claus?

99
00:04:39,569 --> 00:04:42,029
I'm so sorry. It's not at all funny.

100
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:45,839
Do you agree with Cyrus?

101
00:04:47,059 --> 00:04:48,509
I see.

102
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:54,309
I admit, I took a personal interest
in Alice's rehabilitation.

103
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:56,229
Perhaps it biased me.

104
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:57,749
You are correct.

105
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,579
We are not jailers.

106
00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:01,629
Nor are we killers.

107
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:05,019
So I'll ask again...
what would you have us do?

108
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:06,939
"Protect the flame of knowledge

109
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:08,889
no matter the cost."

110
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:11,589
I believe that's how the old motto goes.

111
00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:12,719
Everett.

112
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,119
Sorry I was delayed.

113
00:05:14,129 --> 00:05:17,339
The renovation of our Rome branch
ran into some difficulties.

114
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:19,079
Have you been briefed on Alice?

115
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:20,729
I agree with Zelda.

116
00:05:20,739 --> 00:05:23,869
We are an order of scholars,
not assassins.

117
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:26,689
So what is the scholarly solution?

118
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:27,959
Read their books.

119
00:05:27,969 --> 00:05:29,259
Learn their intentions.

120
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:32,289
We agreed not to breach privacy
unless there was no other option.

121
00:05:32,309 --> 00:05:34,479
What's the other option?

122
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:38,139
Uh, okay.

123
00:05:38,149 --> 00:05:40,729
Well, Nick's book has been taken

124
00:05:40,749 --> 00:05:42,299
and presumably destroyed,

125
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:46,279
but Alice's is still in the Revision
Room having the ending put in.

126
00:05:46,289 --> 00:05:47,889
Which will take days,

127
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:49,759
and if she and Nick split up,
we'll lose them.

128
00:05:49,769 --> 00:05:51,759
There might be another way.

129
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:53,679
Tracking devices.

130
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:56,199
Eventually, they'll go
somewhere for help.

131
00:05:56,209 --> 00:05:57,679
There isn't enough ambient

132
00:05:57,689 --> 00:05:59,469
to keep either of them happy long,

133
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:02,148
so disperse a Searcher widely and...

134
00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:03,949
Disperse to whom, though?

135
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,859
I find it unlikely that Alice or Nick

136
00:06:05,869 --> 00:06:08,169
will run into the hands
of card-carrying Magicians.

137
00:06:08,179 --> 00:06:10,479
- They'll go underground.
- Yes.

138
00:06:10,489 --> 00:06:11,719
Where the hedge witches are.

139
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:14,179
And the hedge witches don't trust us.

140
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:16,959
- We'll never get them to accept...
- If we do what I'm thinking,

141
00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:19,629
they'll take them without ever knowing.

142
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:24,059
Fine. Trackers.

143
00:06:24,069 --> 00:06:25,799
And once Alice's book is back,

144
00:06:25,809 --> 00:06:27,799
if we can verify
she's no longer a threat,

145
00:06:27,809 --> 00:06:30,149
there'd be no need
for further corrective action.

146
00:06:30,159 --> 00:06:31,639
Agreed?

147
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:36,899
All in favor?

148
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,209
Hmm.

149
00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:47,439
You seem troubled.

150
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:51,169
Thank you, but I'm fine.

151
00:06:51,179 --> 00:06:53,869
I understand.

152
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:56,999
I see something of Harriet
in Alice, too.

153
00:06:57,009 --> 00:07:00,439
I wish you'd given yourself some
real time to grieve your daughter.

154
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:03,179
- Leave of absence, even.
- No, I'm...

155
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:10,409
Uh, I'm sorry.

156
00:07:14,329 --> 00:07:16,369
Zelda.

157
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:20,069
I thought I heard something.

158
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:22,469
Excuse me, I have a meeting.

159
00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:35,119
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

160
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:37,429
So you're telling me the Head Librarian,

161
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:39,869
a member of the
Governing Council of the Order,

162
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:41,569
is having a nervous breakdown?

163
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:44,469
Trust me, just 'cause she's
seeing shit that no one else sees

164
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,919
doesn't mean it isn't really there.

165
00:07:45,929 --> 00:07:48,269
Uh, then we got to get
a message to this Everett guy.

166
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:49,579
He's in charge, right?

167
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:50,879
Can't.

168
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:53,219
What do you mean? There's
a dragon that connects

169
00:07:53,229 --> 00:07:54,309
the Underworld to the Neitherlands.

170
00:07:54,329 --> 00:07:56,389
We just take a note, and
we shove it up his...

171
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,409
Not how that works.

172
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:02,299
- Look, being down here...
- You mean being dead?

173
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:05,239
It gives you a new perspective.

174
00:08:05,249 --> 00:08:06,748
There's shit we know is going to happen

175
00:08:06,749 --> 00:08:09,809
that people up there would
give anything to stop.

176
00:08:09,819 --> 00:08:11,769
But we can see the bigger picture.

177
00:08:11,779 --> 00:08:15,379
It's not our job to stop the
living from doing what they do.

178
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:18,079
It's our job to appreciate
their full life.

179
00:08:18,089 --> 00:08:21,909
We see but do not intervene...

180
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,129
for a lot of good reasons.

181
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:25,789
I can see this is wigging you out.

182
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:28,879
Let's start with an easier one.

183
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:32,099
Well, what's my Birthright,
you scaly shit?

184
00:08:32,109 --> 00:08:33,919
Wait...

185
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:35,449
I read this one last week.

186
00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:39,099
High King of Fillory gets mad
at, uh, the alpaca lady,

187
00:08:39,109 --> 00:08:43,409
uh, to bring back
the talking animals' voices.

188
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:45,069
You read Margo's story.

189
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:47,289
This one is not about her.

190
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:50,459
Well, what's my Birthright,
you scaly shit?

191
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,859
Oh, hi, there.

192
00:08:54,869 --> 00:08:57,469
Do you have a message, or...?

193
00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:03,559
Oh!

194
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:05,609
Okay, it was a dream.

195
00:09:05,619 --> 00:09:07,309
Just keep reading.

196
00:09:07,319 --> 00:09:10,969
Well, what's my Birthright,
you scaly shit?

197
00:09:12,489 --> 00:09:14,489
It's the talking animals.

198
00:09:14,499 --> 00:09:18,009
They've all been struck dumb.

199
00:09:18,019 --> 00:09:20,619
Well, shit.

200
00:09:20,629 --> 00:09:23,149
All right, Fen, I think
I will do a ritual.

201
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:25,499
Earth specialty...
the Sleep of Solitude.

202
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:27,979
I pop an Ambien, everyone
leaves me alone till noon.

203
00:09:27,989 --> 00:09:29,989
That'll be perfect.

204
00:09:32,469 --> 00:09:35,329
Rafe, last night I had
the strangest dream.

205
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:38,339
There were these bunnies
with their throats...

206
00:09:38,349 --> 00:09:39,989
You know what?

207
00:09:39,999 --> 00:09:43,119
I think I projected
the talking animals going mute.

208
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:45,849
Okay, I think I'm starting to
get the point of these stories.

209
00:09:45,859 --> 00:09:49,169
All women are just one emotional
crisis away from a psychotic break.

210
00:09:49,179 --> 00:09:50,699
Jesus, no.

211
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:53,439
Whoa, you can't say stuff
like that anymore.

212
00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:54,659
What, in the afterlife?

213
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:57,179
Anywhere.

214
00:09:57,189 --> 00:10:01,009
Do you remember what Kady
was doing at this time?

215
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:02,509
Didn't she just kind of peace out

216
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:05,189
after the Library Dewey coin heist?

217
00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:06,299
Not exactly.

218
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:08,728
See, while the others
were busy bleeding a stone

219
00:10:08,729 --> 00:10:11,369
to stop the monster, Kady...

220
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:14,589
was busy doing something else.

221
00:10:14,599 --> 00:10:16,509
Iris could have at least left us

222
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:18,549
a stone-bleeding how-to or something.

223
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:21,299
Yeah, I hear what you're saying, Q.

224
00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:25,339
- Hey.
- Don't mind me.

225
00:10:30,219 --> 00:10:32,559
Uh, I'll go check those other books.

226
00:10:32,569 --> 00:10:34,749
The books in, uh, Marina's library,

227
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:37,929
'cause, uh, yep, that's got
to be where they are.

228
00:10:39,609 --> 00:10:41,569
Hey.

229
00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:43,399
Haven't seen you in a while.

230
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:46,319
There was some stuff I had to do.

231
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:48,489
Stuff I should be worried about?

232
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:51,229
I'm clean.

233
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:52,699
Good.

234
00:10:56,469 --> 00:10:57,759
Who's this?

235
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:01,379
Five weeks ago, her dad picked her
up from school and disappeared...

236
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:03,289
custody fight with her mom.

237
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:06,729
Locator spell and a few
bruised knuckles later,

238
00:11:06,739 --> 00:11:08,299
she's home.

239
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:12,519
"Five weeks ago" as in when you
were "Detective Sam Cunningham"?

240
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:14,259
You're solving her old case files?

241
00:11:14,269 --> 00:11:16,089
All right, look...

242
00:11:16,099 --> 00:11:18,259
you lived as Kim for months.

243
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:20,479
The moment you got
your memory back, you just...

244
00:11:20,489 --> 00:11:22,959
you dropped it like it never happened.

245
00:11:23,969 --> 00:11:25,969
I-I can't.

246
00:11:27,109 --> 00:11:29,009
I can't go back to being a sidekick.

247
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:30,449
- You're not a sidekick.
- Come on.

248
00:11:30,459 --> 00:11:33,139
I'm only in this group at all
because of Penny.

249
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:35,539
That's not true.

250
00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:37,499
- You and me...
- We're friends, yeah.

251
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:40,459
And then we weren't,
and now we're what...

252
00:11:40,469 --> 00:11:42,159
I don't know,
whatever you call it when...

253
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:43,459
you have a lot of history

254
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,539
that made you two very different people.

255
00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:49,699
I need my own path, Jules.

256
00:11:51,219 --> 00:11:53,339
I want my life to feel
like it's about me.

257
00:11:53,349 --> 00:11:55,299
No, I get that.

258
00:11:55,309 --> 00:11:57,959
And I am all for your personal growth.
It's just that we're...

259
00:11:57,969 --> 00:11:59,269
you know, we're kind of
under the gun here.

260
00:11:59,299 --> 00:12:02,679
You're under my roof,
hidden from the McAllistairs

261
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:04,848
and the Library because I took
this place from Marina

262
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,349
when everyone else wanted

263
00:12:06,369 --> 00:12:08,499
to hand her nuclear launch codes.

264
00:12:10,499 --> 00:12:13,379
Look, I'll help, of course...

265
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:18,239
when I can, in my way.

266
00:12:18,249 --> 00:12:19,759
But for now...

267
00:12:20,729 --> 00:12:23,409
Sam left a few loose ends
I need to tie up.

268
00:12:32,429 --> 00:12:33,729
You're not my Postmate.

269
00:12:33,739 --> 00:12:35,729
I am the Baba Yaga.

270
00:12:35,739 --> 00:12:39,169
You live on my property
under my protection,

271
00:12:39,179 --> 00:12:41,609
and your rent is due.

272
00:12:41,619 --> 00:12:45,809
Okay, well, this isn't exactly my place.

273
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:47,569
Well, you're here now,

274
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:50,849
and the list is clearly posted
on the premises.

275
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:53,359
Wait, Marina's weird
grocery list on the fridge?

276
00:12:53,369 --> 00:12:54,619
It is not weird.

277
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:56,529
You are weird.

278
00:12:56,549 --> 00:12:59,719
You reek of nondairy creamer
and despair.

279
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:03,789
Okay, look, I don't have

280
00:13:03,809 --> 00:13:05,369
whatever it is that you're looking for.

281
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:07,589
One Webster's Weeping Healer,

282
00:13:07,599 --> 00:13:10,069
one Totem of the Plump Pelican,

283
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,119
and one Bag of Holding.

284
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:15,039
Pay what is owed in two days' time

285
00:13:15,049 --> 00:13:17,729
or wish I boiled you alive.

286
00:13:17,739 --> 00:13:19,379
The wench will explain.

287
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:20,729
What?

288
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:30,219
Holy shit, you have to pay her.

289
00:13:30,229 --> 00:13:31,789
"Her"? You mean you.

290
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:33,219
Okay, what the fuck is happening?

291
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,569
I'm Bailey.

292
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:37,399
Sorry about the Baba Yaga. She
can be a little...

293
00:13:37,409 --> 00:13:39,799
The Baba's the spirit
of a vengeful Slavic witch

294
00:13:39,809 --> 00:13:41,669
I channel when I need to collect rent

295
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:43,579
or deal with a chatty Uber driver.

296
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:45,579
So if you don't want to be
her next meal,

297
00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:47,279
you should give her what she wants.

298
00:13:47,289 --> 00:13:48,719
Ooh, stressful.

299
00:13:48,729 --> 00:13:51,589
Where am I supposed to find...

300
00:13:51,599 --> 00:13:53,159
Wait a minute.

301
00:13:53,169 --> 00:13:54,459
Is the...

302
00:13:54,469 --> 00:13:57,299
The Totem of the Plump Pelican.

303
00:13:58,219 --> 00:13:59,379
Wait, this thing?

304
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:00,949
Oh, yeah, that's it.

305
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,339
Oh. Marina must have found it.

306
00:14:03,349 --> 00:14:04,889
I just thought it was some
ugly paperweight.

307
00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:06,689
Shh, don't insult it.

308
00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:08,299
It reacts.

309
00:14:08,309 --> 00:14:10,609
So two more to go.

310
00:14:10,619 --> 00:14:12,349
Oh, shit.

311
00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:13,439
She's coming back.

312
00:14:16,669 --> 00:14:18,359
Pay me what is owed,

313
00:14:18,369 --> 00:14:21,329
or I will boil your marrow
into soup, peasant.

314
00:14:23,032 --> 00:14:24,462
See you Thursday.

315
00:14:36,236 --> 00:14:38,105
I'm looking for a guy called "Lovelady."

316
00:14:38,105 --> 00:14:40,306
Heard he has office hours here.

317
00:14:47,265 --> 00:14:48,515
What is this?

318
00:14:48,525 --> 00:14:50,875
- Some kind of flashlight spell?
- Isik.

319
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,835
- Jesus.
- Whoa!

320
00:15:03,045 --> 00:15:04,645
Satisfied?

321
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:07,655
What the hell was that? I never want
to see the floor of a bar that bright.

322
00:15:07,665 --> 00:15:08,825
Pete?

323
00:15:09,385 --> 00:15:12,245
Wait, you're Lovelady?

324
00:15:12,255 --> 00:15:13,945
Oh, shit.

325
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,555
Kady.

326
00:15:15,565 --> 00:15:17,005
It's been a while.

327
00:15:17,025 --> 00:15:19,625
Last time I saw you,
you were with Marina.

328
00:15:19,925 --> 00:15:21,015
Mm.

329
00:15:21,025 --> 00:15:22,655
We parted ways. It was mutual.

330
00:15:22,675 --> 00:15:24,675
Mm, I'm sure.

331
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:29,474
- So "Lovelady," huh?
- It's a title.

332
00:15:29,475 --> 00:15:32,095
When one guy's done with it, he
passes it on to the next guy,

333
00:15:32,105 --> 00:15:35,065
kind of like "Dread Pirate
Roberts" or "Senator."

334
00:15:35,075 --> 00:15:38,045
That's not how Senators work.

335
00:15:38,055 --> 00:15:39,445
Whatever.

336
00:15:39,655 --> 00:15:41,515
The guy who was "Lovelady before me"

337
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:43,915
is an Earl with a private island.

338
00:15:43,925 --> 00:15:45,655
People respect the shit out of me.

339
00:15:45,665 --> 00:15:48,565
It's a great sign when
you have to tell people that.

340
00:15:48,575 --> 00:15:52,785
Did you come here looking
for my help or...?

341
00:15:52,795 --> 00:15:54,395
Sorry.

342
00:15:56,805 --> 00:16:00,275
Here's a list.

343
00:16:00,285 --> 00:16:01,845
I heard you can find things.

344
00:16:01,855 --> 00:16:04,195
Interesting stuff.

345
00:16:04,205 --> 00:16:05,275
Specific.

346
00:16:05,285 --> 00:16:07,455
Landlord issue.

347
00:16:07,465 --> 00:16:08,805
Have you considered moving?

348
00:16:08,815 --> 00:16:11,285
The place has special features.

349
00:16:11,295 --> 00:16:13,625
It just turns out it's courtesy
of a-a witch...

350
00:16:13,635 --> 00:16:15,425
uh, Baba-something.

351
00:16:15,435 --> 00:16:17,165
You mean the Baba Yaga?

352
00:16:17,175 --> 00:16:20,645
- You know her?
- Just by reputation.

353
00:16:20,655 --> 00:16:22,775
Hey, if I help you,

354
00:16:22,785 --> 00:16:26,785
in lieu of my usual fee,
I want you to introduce me.

355
00:16:26,795 --> 00:16:30,265
- Not sure she's your type.
- She's got great taste.

356
00:16:30,275 --> 00:16:33,325
This could open up
a whole new avenue for me.

357
00:16:35,055 --> 00:16:37,195
Yeah, fine, whatever. You'll help?

358
00:16:38,885 --> 00:16:40,355
One more thing.

359
00:16:40,365 --> 00:16:42,795
Um, do you still see Julia?

360
00:16:42,805 --> 00:16:44,885
Don't be a creep, Pete.

361
00:16:44,895 --> 00:16:46,855
Where are we going?

362
00:16:48,635 --> 00:16:50,545
Black Market.

363
00:16:50,555 --> 00:16:53,675
So Kady's moved on.

364
00:16:53,685 --> 00:16:56,415
I mean, not with Pete, just...

365
00:16:56,425 --> 00:16:57,895
I know what you mean,

366
00:16:57,905 --> 00:17:00,685
and I'm happy for her.

367
00:17:00,695 --> 00:17:02,685
You don't look happy.

368
00:17:02,695 --> 00:17:05,385
So is there some sort of connection

369
00:17:05,395 --> 00:17:07,955
I'm supposed to be seeing between Kady,

370
00:17:07,975 --> 00:17:10,995
Zelda, Fen...

371
00:17:11,005 --> 00:17:12,695
You'll see.

372
00:17:12,705 --> 00:17:18,355
Alice's book had been revised, but
Alice had changed the ending.

373
00:17:18,365 --> 00:17:20,575
- Well?
- Apparently, Alice feels

374
00:17:20,585 --> 00:17:22,665
magic has caused her
nothing but trouble.

375
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:25,925
She goes on to live out an entirely
civilian life in Portland.

376
00:17:25,935 --> 00:17:28,495
She just got a job at a craft brewery,

377
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:29,935
and a Shih Tzu.

378
00:17:29,945 --> 00:17:31,715
You look a little surprised.

379
00:17:31,725 --> 00:17:33,715
Does that not sound like her?

380
00:17:33,725 --> 00:17:36,545
The choice is unexpected, but...

381
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,855
wouldn't be the first time
she walked away from magic.

382
00:17:39,865 --> 00:17:41,725
Great, then.

383
00:17:41,735 --> 00:17:45,105
Nick is still at large, so we'll
keep our trackers in circulation,

384
00:17:45,115 --> 00:17:47,815
but I think we can close
the book on Alice Quinn.

385
00:17:47,825 --> 00:17:49,645
It's funny...

386
00:17:50,505 --> 00:17:53,195
I'd always thought she was a cat person.

387
00:17:54,445 --> 00:17:56,955
Never seen her before. Sorry.

388
00:17:56,965 --> 00:17:59,565
She would be a new hire.

389
00:17:59,575 --> 00:18:01,745
We're not hiring right now.

390
00:18:01,755 --> 00:18:04,105
In fact, we've had to
let some people go.

391
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:06,605
Designer hops are getting expensive.

392
00:18:12,765 --> 00:18:14,175
Well?

393
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,365
Alice is inside, as her book said.

394
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:19,535
Hmm. Good riddance, book tart.

395
00:18:20,295 --> 00:18:22,735
Let's go get some doughnuts.

396
00:18:27,215 --> 00:18:29,075
This is the Black Market?

397
00:18:29,085 --> 00:18:31,125
- It's so...
- Normal?

398
00:18:31,135 --> 00:18:32,905
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

399
00:18:32,915 --> 00:18:35,605
You'd be surprised
what you can find in here.

400
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:36,875
Even Deweys.

401
00:18:36,885 --> 00:18:39,175
Wait, I thought you had to
have a Library card for that?

402
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:41,565
Yeah, well, the Library
should know better

403
00:18:41,575 --> 00:18:43,575
than to give unlimited black cards

404
00:18:43,585 --> 00:18:46,735
to rich druggie dickbags that
trade them in for lap dances.

405
00:18:46,745 --> 00:18:48,885
Oh, so you give lap dances, huh?

406
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:50,315
Selectively.

407
00:18:51,675 --> 00:18:54,015
Okay, so that is Whitley.

408
00:18:54,025 --> 00:18:57,105
If she does not have a Bag of
Holding, she'll have a line on one.

409
00:18:57,115 --> 00:18:58,435
What, you're not gonna introduce me?

410
00:18:58,455 --> 00:19:01,195
Well, I may have had sex with her

411
00:19:01,215 --> 00:19:02,545
and never called her again.

412
00:19:02,555 --> 00:19:03,925
Classy.

413
00:19:04,255 --> 00:19:07,855
Hey, I'm looking for a Bag of Holding...

414
00:19:07,865 --> 00:19:10,035
whatever that is.

415
00:19:10,045 --> 00:19:12,075
It's a "Doctor Who" kind of thing.

416
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:13,815
A bag that's bigger on the inside.

417
00:19:13,825 --> 00:19:15,555
Actually, it's a D&D thing.

418
00:19:15,605 --> 00:19:16,985
Yeah, I don't do nerd shit.

419
00:19:16,995 --> 00:19:20,285
Expensive taste for someone who
doesn't know what they're asking for.

420
00:19:22,045 --> 00:19:23,255
I can pay.

421
00:19:24,825 --> 00:19:26,815
Charisma Cufflinks...

422
00:19:26,825 --> 00:19:28,825
for a Bag of Holding?

423
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:31,605
Come back when you're serious.

424
00:19:38,925 --> 00:19:41,655
Kraken tentacles... helps build muscle.

425
00:19:41,705 --> 00:19:42,785
I'm paleo.

426
00:19:42,805 --> 00:19:45,355
Cavemen didn't eat kraken,
so I don't eat kraken.

427
00:19:48,205 --> 00:19:50,455
What'll you give me for these?

428
00:19:59,935 --> 00:20:01,665
Aleister Crowley's ashes.

429
00:20:01,675 --> 00:20:03,535
- Mm-hmm.
- Not bad.

430
00:20:03,545 --> 00:20:05,855
Worth a Bag of Holding?

431
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:13,395
Thanks.

432
00:20:15,955 --> 00:20:19,515
What the hell, Pete? I searched
the whole goddamn market for you.

433
00:20:19,525 --> 00:20:21,555
Kady, great news.

434
00:20:21,565 --> 00:20:24,295
I found Gordy. Gordy's my, um...

435
00:20:25,615 --> 00:20:27,665
- He's great.
- Hi, Kaitlin.

436
00:20:27,675 --> 00:20:28,885
Kady.

437
00:20:28,965 --> 00:20:33,255
You were supposed to be looking for
the Webster's Weeping Whatever,

438
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:34,435
not getting wasted.

439
00:20:34,455 --> 00:20:36,835
¿Por qué no los dos, mamacita?

440
00:20:36,845 --> 00:20:40,215
I'll have you know Gordy is a doctor.

441
00:20:40,235 --> 00:20:42,585
- Well...
- For animals.

442
00:20:42,605 --> 00:20:45,445
You know, for dogs and cats.

443
00:20:45,455 --> 00:20:47,055
Don't sell yourself short, all right?

444
00:20:47,075 --> 00:20:49,975
- That's a real doctor.
- Ok... shh, shh, shh. Not helpful.

445
00:20:49,985 --> 00:20:53,065
Yes, helpful, because Gordy knows

446
00:20:53,075 --> 00:20:55,805
where to get that thing
that you're looking for.

447
00:20:55,815 --> 00:20:58,685
The thing. The creepy doll
that cries healing tears.

448
00:20:58,695 --> 00:21:00,905
Webster's Weeping Healer.

449
00:21:00,915 --> 00:21:03,995
Got a buddy, Duke... exotic-bird guy.

450
00:21:04,005 --> 00:21:06,075
So his cockatoo caught bumblefoot...

451
00:21:06,085 --> 00:21:07,515
Okay, shh.

452
00:21:07,525 --> 00:21:08,825
Duke has the doll?

453
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:10,215
Well, yeah.

454
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:12,125
Okay, where can I find him?

455
00:21:15,795 --> 00:21:19,185
Hello? Anybody there?

456
00:21:22,805 --> 00:21:24,745
I'm guessing no one's home.

457
00:21:32,315 --> 00:21:34,635
Well, that explains it.

458
00:21:38,827 --> 00:21:41,957
No sign of blunt-force trauma
or defensive wounds.

459
00:21:42,147 --> 00:21:43,827
Doesn't look like foul play.

460
00:21:43,837 --> 00:21:45,837
Okay, Mariska Hargitay.

461
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:48,937
Just find the doll, will you?

462
00:22:01,817 --> 00:22:04,717
No, bad touch!

463
00:22:04,727 --> 00:22:07,067
Get off!

464
00:22:07,077 --> 00:22:08,687
God, I hate this place.

465
00:22:08,697 --> 00:22:10,247
But...

466
00:22:10,327 --> 00:22:11,947
found the doll.

467
00:22:11,957 --> 00:22:13,557
Ugh.

468
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:14,997
Healing tears or no,

469
00:22:15,007 --> 00:22:17,617
I would not keep this thing in my house.

470
00:22:20,137 --> 00:22:21,787
Really, Pete?

471
00:22:21,797 --> 00:22:23,787
What? He's not using it.

472
00:22:23,797 --> 00:22:26,057
You're disgusting.

473
00:22:40,117 --> 00:22:42,757
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

474
00:22:47,827 --> 00:22:49,507
Jesus, Fen!

475
00:22:49,517 --> 00:22:51,507
Why the hell are you lurking
in a dark pantry?

476
00:22:51,517 --> 00:22:52,747
Waiting for you.

477
00:22:52,757 --> 00:22:54,967
Your soufflé fell.
You're gonna bake a new one.

478
00:22:54,977 --> 00:22:57,547
- How did you...
- Dreamt it.

479
00:22:59,487 --> 00:23:02,917
You're worried Margo is gonna
blow talks with Lady Pike.

480
00:23:02,927 --> 00:23:06,057
Wait, again with the alpaca lady?

481
00:23:06,067 --> 00:23:07,087
Sorry.

482
00:23:07,107 --> 00:23:09,877
Uh, some of these pages
are out of order.

483
00:23:09,887 --> 00:23:11,317
Just keep reading.

484
00:23:11,327 --> 00:23:13,347
But really, you're worried
that you and she have

485
00:23:13,367 --> 00:23:15,297
a true connection and you're
going to screw it up,

486
00:23:15,307 --> 00:23:17,767
- so you're stress-baking.
- Okay, ouch.

487
00:23:17,777 --> 00:23:20,667
And that's a weirdly specific
and accurate dream.

488
00:23:20,677 --> 00:23:22,537
I also dreamt of dancing ears of corn,

489
00:23:22,547 --> 00:23:24,647
and then the farmers reported a surplus.

490
00:23:24,667 --> 00:23:26,237
I dreamt about what Tick really does

491
00:23:26,247 --> 00:23:27,866
with all those peaches
he steals from the kitchen,

492
00:23:27,867 --> 00:23:30,377
which is surprisingly not gross.

493
00:23:30,387 --> 00:23:32,857
And they've all come true.

494
00:23:32,867 --> 00:23:35,947
Prophetic dreams could mean
a lot of things.

495
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:38,037
Uh, maybe you're a psychic

496
00:23:38,047 --> 00:23:40,517
or someone cast some kind
of spell on you.

497
00:23:40,527 --> 00:23:44,037
Or... or it's Fillory, and maybe
you just ate some messed-up fruit.

498
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,997
You think someone did this to me?

499
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,787
If you're worried, next time it happens

500
00:23:47,797 --> 00:23:49,917
just poke around the dream a little.

501
00:23:49,927 --> 00:23:51,967
Poke with what? A knife?

502
00:23:51,977 --> 00:23:55,107
No. No knives. Lucid dreaming.

503
00:23:55,117 --> 00:23:56,857
They teach it first semester
at Brakebills.

504
00:23:56,867 --> 00:23:58,267
The second you realize you're dreaming,

505
00:23:58,287 --> 00:23:59,927
you can take control of your dream.

506
00:23:59,987 --> 00:24:01,497
You don't even need magic to do it.

507
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:03,587
Just close your eyes...

508
00:24:03,597 --> 00:24:06,497
Breathe, and try to push your finger

509
00:24:06,507 --> 00:24:08,287
through your other hand.

510
00:24:08,297 --> 00:24:09,807
Everything freezes.

511
00:24:09,827 --> 00:24:13,027
Anything not supposed to be there,
that's when you'll be able to tell.

512
00:24:13,977 --> 00:24:15,977
Alice wasn't where
her book said she'd be.

513
00:24:15,987 --> 00:24:18,977
I suspect she sabotaged it.

514
00:24:18,987 --> 00:24:22,107
And now I've lied to my colleagues.

515
00:24:22,117 --> 00:24:25,047
If I don't find her
before they find out...

516
00:24:25,947 --> 00:24:28,037
Sounds like a personal problem.

517
00:24:29,867 --> 00:24:32,727
Henry, please.

518
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:34,427
I'm trusting you.

519
00:24:34,437 --> 00:24:36,337
What you mean is that you trust

520
00:24:36,347 --> 00:24:38,037
that I won't report this

521
00:24:38,047 --> 00:24:41,827
- because it'd be worse for Alice.
- We both want to spare her that.

522
00:24:41,837 --> 00:24:43,437
If you could just tell me
where she is...

523
00:24:43,447 --> 00:24:47,357
I comply with every request...

524
00:24:47,367 --> 00:24:50,797
all your red tape
and your triplicate bullshit.

525
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:56,717
This is your mess.
Do not drag me into it.

526
00:25:21,047 --> 00:25:23,297
Harriet?

527
00:25:23,317 --> 00:25:24,807
_

528
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:29,387
_

529
00:25:50,247 --> 00:25:53,757
I don't think an ancient Slavic
witch is gonna want a mojito.

530
00:25:53,767 --> 00:25:55,457
Right, um...

531
00:25:55,467 --> 00:25:57,197
something vodka-based?

532
00:25:57,207 --> 00:25:59,197
Are you actually nervous?

533
00:25:59,207 --> 00:26:00,827
Baba Yaga's a really big deal

534
00:26:00,847 --> 00:26:02,587
in my line of work, and...

535
00:26:02,597 --> 00:26:05,727
First impressions...

536
00:26:05,737 --> 00:26:09,037
- What was I saying?
- Pete, your arm.

537
00:26:09,047 --> 00:26:10,677
Ah...

538
00:26:11,357 --> 00:26:15,527
that molest-y hand gave me the clap.

539
00:26:15,537 --> 00:26:17,497
Oh, shit.

540
00:26:21,058 --> 00:26:22,898
Looks like a bad spell interaction.

541
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:25,458
Something's clashing with one
of his personal enchantments.

542
00:26:25,468 --> 00:26:26,668
Which personal enchantment?

543
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,588
I don't know. They're personal.

544
00:26:28,648 --> 00:26:31,448
Hedge spells, you know,
they're off the street at best.

545
00:26:31,488 --> 00:26:32,818
They got a lot of rough edges.

546
00:26:32,828 --> 00:26:35,028
There's really no telling
if they'll play nice together

547
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:37,048
until, well, they don't.

548
00:26:37,068 --> 00:26:39,368
Whatever killed Duke is killing him.

549
00:26:39,378 --> 00:26:42,074
So help him, or I break your jaw.

550
00:26:42,074 --> 00:26:44,273
Look, the only human
diagnostic spell I know

551
00:26:44,274 --> 00:26:46,664
costs magic, and I'm a little
Dewey-light at the mo...

552
00:26:46,674 --> 00:26:48,284
Please don't break my jaw.

553
00:26:48,294 --> 00:26:49,984
Fine.

554
00:26:49,994 --> 00:26:52,294
Pete has one he took off
your friend Duke.

555
00:26:52,304 --> 00:26:55,814
Wait. Wait, you said
something's clashing with Pete.

556
00:26:55,824 --> 00:26:56,834
Mm-hmm.

557
00:26:56,844 --> 00:26:59,304
- Like what?
- Like a cursed object.

558
00:26:59,314 --> 00:27:01,414
I once treated a horse for strangles.

559
00:27:01,434 --> 00:27:03,544
Turns out jockey's riding crop
interacted badly

560
00:27:03,574 --> 00:27:05,954
with a hoof-protection spell, so...

561
00:27:05,964 --> 00:27:08,004
Does Pete carry a riding crop?

562
00:27:08,014 --> 00:27:10,704
Okay, maybe just look at this.

563
00:27:12,114 --> 00:27:13,494
Cobalt.

564
00:27:13,504 --> 00:27:14,904
Don't touch that shit.

565
00:27:14,914 --> 00:27:17,154
Not really planning to
now that you licked it.

566
00:27:17,164 --> 00:27:20,024
What? It's more accurate than lenses.
You can taste cobalt.

567
00:27:20,034 --> 00:27:21,504
It's used in most tracking spells.

568
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:23,024
- "Tracking spells"?
- Mm-hmm.

569
00:27:23,034 --> 00:27:26,024
I put them on pets. This one tastes
like a real expensive Searcher.

570
00:27:26,034 --> 00:27:28,114
You hold it long enough,
it kind of sends out

571
00:27:28,124 --> 00:27:29,904
a signal to whoever cast it.

572
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:32,514
Wait, a-a signal to wh... who?

573
00:27:32,524 --> 00:27:33,694
Aliens.

574
00:27:33,704 --> 00:27:36,254
I was thinking more
like who makes Deweys.

575
00:27:36,264 --> 00:27:38,254
- The Library.
- Oh, yeah.

576
00:27:38,264 --> 00:27:40,044
That makes more sense.

577
00:27:40,054 --> 00:27:42,264
Who's the Library looking for?

578
00:27:42,274 --> 00:27:44,134
Oh, I can think of a few people.

579
00:27:44,144 --> 00:27:46,964
Wait, how many hedges have
these personal enchantments?

580
00:27:46,974 --> 00:27:49,054
Pretty much everybody.

581
00:27:49,064 --> 00:27:50,404
Shit.

582
00:27:50,414 --> 00:27:54,144
- Take off all of Pete's, now.
- What are you gonna do?

583
00:27:54,154 --> 00:27:55,924
I'm gonna warn everybody.

584
00:27:55,934 --> 00:28:00,014
Wait a second. So the Library's
responsible for hedge witches dying?

585
00:28:00,024 --> 00:28:02,064
Yeah, but they don't know that yet.

586
00:28:02,074 --> 00:28:03,514
Spoiler alert.

587
00:28:03,524 --> 00:28:05,854
Zelda had some other things
on her mind at the time.

588
00:28:05,864 --> 00:28:07,374
Her dead daughter.

589
00:28:07,384 --> 00:28:09,574
Wait, is she, like, down here?

590
00:28:10,904 --> 00:28:13,424
I thought you didn't like spoilers.

591
00:28:13,434 --> 00:28:15,254
Look, I'm sorry you see dead people,

592
00:28:15,264 --> 00:28:17,074
but that is an incredibly stupid idea.

593
00:28:17,084 --> 00:28:19,434
She's not dead. Ghosts don't bleed.

594
00:28:19,444 --> 00:28:22,414
I don't know how, but she could
be alive stuck in there.

595
00:28:22,424 --> 00:28:24,434
That's insane... and impossible.

596
00:28:24,444 --> 00:28:25,914
It's the Mirror Realm.

597
00:28:25,924 --> 00:28:28,524
We don't know what's impossible.

598
00:28:28,534 --> 00:28:30,574
It's not as complicated
as a mirror bridge.

599
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:32,964
We just need to open a door
to the place between mirrors.

600
00:28:32,974 --> 00:28:34,744
Listen, Zelds, if you told me you wanted

601
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:36,594
to finger-paint your blood
so you could take a walk

602
00:28:36,604 --> 00:28:39,014
in the crazy dimension
I would say, "Free country."

603
00:28:39,024 --> 00:28:40,934
But this is my blood.

604
00:28:41,464 --> 00:28:43,454
I can't do this...

605
00:28:43,464 --> 00:28:45,064
without your help.

606
00:28:45,074 --> 00:28:46,454
Yes, I know that.

607
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,634
- And I'm leaving.
- She's my daughter.

608
00:28:51,344 --> 00:28:52,644
Harriet...

609
00:28:53,714 --> 00:28:55,164
who's older than you?

610
00:28:55,174 --> 00:28:58,384
Our relationship is complicated.

611
00:28:58,394 --> 00:28:59,994
Clearly.

612
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:02,294
You smashed the mirror.

613
00:29:02,304 --> 00:29:03,335
You...

614
00:29:04,184 --> 00:29:05,434
trapped her there.

615
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:06,654
I was doing my job.

616
00:29:06,664 --> 00:29:09,392
I can't...

617
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:13,524
Live with myself if I don't
find a way to help her.

618
00:29:16,974 --> 00:29:18,234
Please.

619
00:29:20,374 --> 00:29:22,054
Christ.

620
00:29:24,244 --> 00:29:26,194
I'm gonna regret this, aren't I?

621
00:29:29,294 --> 00:29:32,894
- Did you juice the beets?
- Oh, I juiced the beets.

622
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:34,634
I told you I would juice the beets.

623
00:29:34,644 --> 00:29:37,634
- Why wouldn't I juice the beets?
- Don't make this about us.

624
00:29:37,644 --> 00:29:39,334
Wait, did I miss something?

625
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:43,944
I thought Margo and Josh were an
unlikely yet heartwarming thing.

626
00:29:43,954 --> 00:29:46,384
No, this is after
the Lady Pike incident.

627
00:29:46,394 --> 00:29:49,044
Margo called Josh a sweater boy.

628
00:29:49,054 --> 00:29:50,344
Forget it.

629
00:29:50,354 --> 00:29:51,914
Pay attention to Fen.

630
00:29:51,924 --> 00:29:53,614
How's this shit work?

631
00:29:53,624 --> 00:29:58,004
Pour it gently
onto the lizard, Your Majesty.

632
00:30:08,074 --> 00:30:11,424
Jesus lizard-fucking Christ!

633
00:30:14,554 --> 00:30:19,424
Does this feel like a weird
sort of dream to any of you?

634
00:30:24,084 --> 00:30:26,564
All right, maybe I can control this.

635
00:30:32,444 --> 00:30:36,614
Ember's balls. This is a dream.

636
00:30:36,624 --> 00:30:40,494
Okay, okay. Stop talking to
yourself and, uh, look around.

637
00:30:42,584 --> 00:30:44,094
Hey!

638
00:30:44,104 --> 00:30:45,224
Who are you?

639
00:30:45,234 --> 00:30:47,094
Wait, no! Stop, please!

640
00:30:47,104 --> 00:30:48,574
Freeze! Freeze!

641
00:30:48,584 --> 00:30:50,494
Hey, hey, stop!

642
00:30:50,504 --> 00:30:52,074
Freeze! Green Lady!

643
00:30:52,094 --> 00:30:53,113
Hold up!

644
00:30:53,114 --> 00:30:55,164
Hey, Green Lady, come back!

645
00:30:59,294 --> 00:31:01,954
Umber's ass, this is getting annoying.

646
00:31:12,484 --> 00:31:13,919
Hey, wait!

647
00:31:14,524 --> 00:31:16,254
Wait, I just want to talk!

648
00:31:16,264 --> 00:31:18,434
Why am I having these stupid dreams?

649
00:31:18,444 --> 00:31:20,044
Oh, no.

650
00:31:20,054 --> 00:31:21,614
The lizard.

651
00:31:21,624 --> 00:31:24,484
You pour it gently
onto the lizard, Your Majesty.

652
00:31:24,494 --> 00:31:26,394
Wait, stop! It'll catch fire!

653
00:31:26,404 --> 00:31:28,004
The fuck?

654
00:31:28,014 --> 00:31:31,014
I saw the lizard blow up

655
00:31:31,024 --> 00:31:33,444
when Rafe...

656
00:31:33,454 --> 00:31:35,104
Antidote.

657
00:31:35,114 --> 00:31:37,064
What is she talking about?

658
00:31:37,074 --> 00:31:38,624
Perhaps she's mad with grief

659
00:31:38,634 --> 00:31:41,064
over the loss of King Eliot,
Your Majesty.

660
00:31:41,074 --> 00:31:42,544
I assure you, all the animals

661
00:31:42,554 --> 00:31:45,024
have responded quite positively
to the antidote.

662
00:31:45,034 --> 00:31:47,334
Well, this one definitely won't.

663
00:31:47,344 --> 00:31:50,034
Foosh. Fried Lizard.

664
00:31:50,044 --> 00:31:52,604
And where are you getting
this information?

665
00:31:56,524 --> 00:31:58,034
I...

666
00:31:58,044 --> 00:31:59,604
I dreamt it.

667
00:31:59,614 --> 00:32:02,834
Fen has been having
kind of prophetic dreams.

668
00:32:02,844 --> 00:32:05,374
She knew my soufflé was gonna
fall before that ever happened.

669
00:32:05,384 --> 00:32:06,854
It's a stupid fucking premonition.

670
00:32:06,864 --> 00:32:08,974
You want to risk the life of your
lizard, or is that a relationship

671
00:32:08,994 --> 00:32:11,874
- you're willing to set fire to as well?
- Oh, I'll fucking fry this lizard.

672
00:32:11,894 --> 00:32:14,364
Okay, can we... can we focus
for one minute?

673
00:32:14,374 --> 00:32:15,524
- Sure.
- Yes.

674
00:32:15,534 --> 00:32:16,664
- Fine.
- Let's.

675
00:32:16,674 --> 00:32:17,734
- Cool.
- Great.

676
00:32:17,744 --> 00:32:18,583
Okay.

677
00:32:19,544 --> 00:32:22,544
Say I don't dose
Newt Scamander with beet juice.

678
00:32:22,554 --> 00:32:25,634
How the shit am I supposed
to get his wrinkly ass talking?

679
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:27,504
I don't know, but I have an idea

680
00:32:27,514 --> 00:32:30,504
of where to look for answers.

681
00:32:30,514 --> 00:32:32,244
I lucid-dreamed.

682
00:32:32,254 --> 00:32:34,384
I saw a woman in a green hood.

683
00:32:34,394 --> 00:32:36,684
She has to be the one
giving me premonitions.

684
00:32:36,694 --> 00:32:38,214
Awesome. You got it working.

685
00:32:38,224 --> 00:32:40,384
- A-plus.
- B-minus.

686
00:32:40,394 --> 00:32:41,864
Unless...

687
00:32:41,874 --> 00:32:44,654
you tell us where this green bitch went.

688
00:32:44,664 --> 00:32:47,824
Well, in my dream,
I chased her to this stream

689
00:32:47,834 --> 00:32:50,574
by the Fuchsia Forest of Corian's Land.

690
00:32:50,584 --> 00:32:52,744
Corian's Land...

691
00:32:52,754 --> 00:32:55,404
also known as Sloth's Bane.

692
00:32:55,414 --> 00:32:58,274
I don't know what everything
in my dreams means... mean.

693
00:32:58,284 --> 00:33:01,234
Anyway, I know that the answers

694
00:33:01,244 --> 00:33:03,584
to our questions...
answers lie... lay there?

695
00:33:03,594 --> 00:33:05,414
I-I'm not usually the one

696
00:33:05,424 --> 00:33:07,874
who gives the big speech,
so I'm... I'm going.

697
00:33:07,894 --> 00:33:10,734
So that... that's happening.

698
00:33:21,342 --> 00:33:22,962
Gordy says "you're welcome."

699
00:33:23,342 --> 00:33:24,907
And he left you a bill.

700
00:33:25,192 --> 00:33:28,542
That guy puts a really
high value on his time.

701
00:33:31,672 --> 00:33:33,662
Wait, did I miss the Baba Yaga?

702
00:33:33,672 --> 00:33:35,882
Well, you snooze, you lose.

703
00:33:35,892 --> 00:33:38,362
I wasn't snoozing, I was dying.

704
00:33:38,372 --> 00:33:41,012
We got bigger fish to fry.

705
00:33:41,022 --> 00:33:42,672
I'll explain everything

706
00:33:42,682 --> 00:33:45,372
as soon as your hedge witch
friends get here.

707
00:33:48,382 --> 00:33:50,242
I know every instinct is telling you

708
00:33:50,252 --> 00:33:53,022
not to trust me... or anyone.

709
00:33:53,032 --> 00:33:56,382
But someone put a tracker on this.

710
00:33:56,392 --> 00:33:58,642
It's a complex, expensive,

711
00:33:58,652 --> 00:34:00,912
very high-level spell.

712
00:34:07,272 --> 00:34:08,692
It marked him.

713
00:34:08,702 --> 00:34:10,292
It looks like the Deweys you touched

714
00:34:10,312 --> 00:34:12,292
are doing the same to you.

715
00:34:12,302 --> 00:34:14,382
If you have any enchantments running...

716
00:34:14,392 --> 00:34:15,652
anything you got in a safe house,

717
00:34:15,672 --> 00:34:17,692
anything homebrewed...
it could kill you...

718
00:34:17,842 --> 00:34:21,322
just like it did to Duke
and almost did to Pete.

719
00:34:22,662 --> 00:34:24,702
She saved my life.

720
00:34:24,712 --> 00:34:26,922
I trust her, and I vouch for her.

721
00:34:26,932 --> 00:34:30,612
- Who did this?
- The Library.

722
00:34:30,622 --> 00:34:32,831
They make the Deweys,
and they don't give a shit

723
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,842
about what happens to the hedges.

724
00:34:34,852 --> 00:34:37,582
They're trying to find someone,

725
00:34:37,592 --> 00:34:39,752
and we're just collateral damage.

726
00:34:39,862 --> 00:34:42,942
So ask yourselves...
if this is what they do

727
00:34:42,952 --> 00:34:45,772
when they're not even thinking about us,

728
00:34:45,782 --> 00:34:48,782
what happens when they decide
we're a threat?

729
00:34:52,052 --> 00:34:53,592
Are we just gonna let people like them

730
00:34:53,602 --> 00:34:56,042
tell us we're not important?

731
00:34:58,452 --> 00:35:00,151
That we're just some side characters

732
00:35:00,152 --> 00:35:03,792
in their fucked-up fascist plot?

733
00:35:03,802 --> 00:35:07,452
My mom was a hedge...

734
00:35:07,462 --> 00:35:11,322
and she was killed by another hedge.

735
00:35:11,332 --> 00:35:13,982
You'd think that would
turn me against you.

736
00:35:16,812 --> 00:35:18,942
But it didn't.

737
00:35:18,952 --> 00:35:22,722
It just made me realize that
it doesn't have to be this way.

738
00:35:22,732 --> 00:35:25,332
If we could stop
screwing each other over

739
00:35:25,342 --> 00:35:27,552
long enough to work together,

740
00:35:27,562 --> 00:35:31,122
then it's not the Library's story.

741
00:35:31,132 --> 00:35:33,952
It's our story.

742
00:35:40,402 --> 00:35:41,482
Hey.

743
00:35:41,492 --> 00:35:43,482
I have a buddy in Modesto.

744
00:35:43,492 --> 00:35:46,442
He says there's a leaky
Library pipe there.

745
00:35:46,452 --> 00:35:49,142
I say we use it
to make those assholes pay.

746
00:35:49,152 --> 00:35:50,882
Look, I know
what you're going through...

747
00:35:50,892 --> 00:35:53,172
Do you? They kill your boyfriend?

748
00:35:53,182 --> 00:35:55,032
Actually, yeah.

749
00:35:56,982 --> 00:35:59,412
Look, we'll figure out what to do next.

750
00:35:59,422 --> 00:36:00,672
I already know what to do.

751
00:36:00,682 --> 00:36:04,592
You do that, you're giving
them a reason to wipe us out.

752
00:36:04,602 --> 00:36:08,382
Please just get a little sleep.
We'll talk tomorrow.

753
00:36:08,392 --> 00:36:11,082
Hey, you're not alone, okay?

754
00:36:11,092 --> 00:36:14,052
We'll figure this out together in
a way that feels right for you.

755
00:36:15,832 --> 00:36:17,652
Okay.

756
00:36:17,662 --> 00:36:19,532
Yeah, we can do that.

757
00:36:32,152 --> 00:36:35,882
It's a copy of our library, but wrong.

758
00:36:37,902 --> 00:36:40,412
I was gonna say a total mindfuck.

759
00:36:40,422 --> 00:36:42,112
Tomato, tomah-to.

760
00:36:45,212 --> 00:36:46,722
Oh, you go on.

761
00:36:46,732 --> 00:36:49,722
I'll just be here cutting myself
to keep our bloody exit open.

762
00:36:49,732 --> 00:36:52,002
Hey, just made a joke.

763
00:37:02,832 --> 00:37:04,872
Hello?

764
00:38:05,062 --> 00:38:06,852
_

765
00:38:07,402 --> 00:38:09,012
_

766
00:38:11,482 --> 00:38:13,862
_

767
00:38:13,902 --> 00:38:16,769
_

768
00:38:17,162 --> 00:38:20,162
_

769
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:23,952
_

770
00:38:27,372 --> 00:38:29,772
_

771
00:38:30,132 --> 00:38:31,932
_

772
00:38:33,052 --> 00:38:34,392
_

773
00:38:35,842 --> 00:38:37,732
_

774
00:38:37,802 --> 00:38:40,092
_

775
00:38:51,682 --> 00:38:53,092
Where have you been?

776
00:38:53,112 --> 00:38:56,632
Your funhouse-mirror daughter
shanked me. We have to go.

777
00:38:56,652 --> 00:38:59,142
Those things weren't her. The real
Harriet could still be in here.

778
00:38:59,152 --> 00:39:01,172
- I can't just leave her.
- I hate to break it to you, love...

779
00:39:01,192 --> 00:39:03,552
she might still be in there,
but so are those monsters.

780
00:39:25,402 --> 00:39:26,522
An attack?

781
00:39:26,532 --> 00:39:27,962
On what branch?

782
00:39:27,972 --> 00:39:30,442
Modesto, California.

783
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:32,882
We lost four Librarians.

784
00:39:32,892 --> 00:39:34,622
Hedge witches did it.

785
00:39:34,632 --> 00:39:36,662
But... but why?

786
00:39:39,552 --> 00:39:43,372
There was some fallout
from your tracker coins.

787
00:39:43,382 --> 00:39:45,592
It's not your fault.

788
00:39:45,602 --> 00:39:47,762
Just unforeseen interaction.

789
00:39:47,772 --> 00:39:49,942
Several hedges died.

790
00:39:49,952 --> 00:39:54,862
The whole point of doing this was
to avoid having to hurt anyone.

791
00:39:54,872 --> 00:39:56,602
I should have been here.

792
00:39:56,612 --> 00:39:58,292
You can't blame yourself.

793
00:39:58,302 --> 00:40:01,562
If anything, today we learned
the true danger we're in

794
00:40:01,572 --> 00:40:04,532
and that your trackers
might provide a solution.

795
00:40:06,312 --> 00:40:08,002
What do you mean?

796
00:40:08,012 --> 00:40:10,442
Complications aside...

797
00:40:10,452 --> 00:40:12,432
the idea is sound.

798
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:16,402
Put whatever we have
into circulation among them.

799
00:40:16,412 --> 00:40:19,792
We keep Modesto from happening again.

800
00:40:19,802 --> 00:40:23,022
Are you suggesting
we kill hedge witches?

801
00:40:23,032 --> 00:40:25,452
I am suggesting
that we keep an eye on them.

802
00:40:25,462 --> 00:40:27,412
To "protect the flame of knowledge"

803
00:40:27,422 --> 00:40:30,732
from ever being extinguished,
no matter the cost."

804
00:40:33,042 --> 00:40:35,302
I don't know what to say.

805
00:40:39,342 --> 00:40:41,602
This is an awesome responsibility.

806
00:40:41,612 --> 00:40:43,732
You and I both know that,
but who is better suited

807
00:40:43,742 --> 00:40:47,342
to bear that responsibility
than The Order?

808
00:40:48,962 --> 00:40:51,782
There is no one I trust more deeply

809
00:40:51,792 --> 00:40:55,002
to be fair and right than you.

810
00:41:01,672 --> 00:41:03,712
Alice.

811
00:41:03,722 --> 00:41:07,422
I can't stay long. I-I cast a spell to
keep the Library from eavesdropping,

812
00:41:07,432 --> 00:41:09,302
but it won't last.

813
00:41:10,512 --> 00:41:12,152
I need your help.

814
00:41:12,162 --> 00:41:14,542
They have my friend Sheila.

815
00:41:14,552 --> 00:41:16,562
I know.

816
00:41:19,082 --> 00:41:20,862
Hello, Ms. Quinn.

817
00:41:20,872 --> 00:41:22,772
Alice, please.

818
00:41:22,782 --> 00:41:25,032
Nothing will happen to you here.

819
00:41:25,042 --> 00:41:27,112
Zelda wants to talk.

820
00:41:28,392 --> 00:41:29,612
Why?

821
00:41:32,052 --> 00:41:33,882
I need your help.

822
00:41:35,582 --> 00:41:37,652
I think I've seen enough.

823
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:41,882
To counteract a lifetime
of cis-het frat-bro bias?

824
00:41:41,902 --> 00:41:44,322
- I-I doubt it.
- Okay.

825
00:41:44,332 --> 00:41:46,922
So tell me, what was I supposed
to take from that?

826
00:41:46,932 --> 00:41:49,542
Zelda doesn't know it yet,
but what she just set in motion

827
00:41:49,552 --> 00:41:51,802
is going to change the Library forever.

828
00:41:51,812 --> 00:41:54,452
Same with Fen and Fillory,

829
00:41:54,462 --> 00:41:57,542
Kady and all of magic.

830
00:41:57,552 --> 00:41:59,632
When you file people away as sidekicks,

831
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,422
you don't realize
their importance to the story,

832
00:42:02,432 --> 00:42:04,642
and this story belongs

833
00:42:04,652 --> 00:42:07,602
to a lot more people than you think.

834
00:42:07,612 --> 00:42:09,692
Where to shelve a book,

835
00:42:09,702 --> 00:42:11,432
it's not a little thing.

836
00:42:11,442 --> 00:42:13,862
You're telling the world what to value,

837
00:42:13,872 --> 00:42:16,892
who to value.

838
00:42:17,572 --> 00:42:20,052
You get our responsibility here?

839
00:42:20,062 --> 00:42:21,922
Well said.

840
00:42:21,932 --> 00:42:24,612
I think you've earned
the right to move up.

841
00:42:24,622 --> 00:42:27,882
Excuse me?

842
00:42:27,892 --> 00:42:31,492
I know so much about you
and your friends,

843
00:42:31,502 --> 00:42:34,682
but you never asked me how I died.

844
00:42:36,112 --> 00:42:38,112
O-okay, um...

845
00:42:38,122 --> 00:42:41,152
- How did you die?
- Arrow to the chest...

846
00:42:41,162 --> 00:42:42,812
during the Crusades.

847
00:42:42,822 --> 00:42:43,942
"The Crusades"?

848
00:42:43,952 --> 00:42:46,032
1,000 years ago?

849
00:42:46,042 --> 00:42:47,642
We really thought the story

850
00:42:47,652 --> 00:42:50,772
was all about white guys
back then, believe me.

851
00:42:50,782 --> 00:42:53,602
And I'm not new at all.

852
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:57,602
I'm actually
your supervisor's supervisor.

853
00:42:57,612 --> 00:43:00,132
So you're my boss.

854
00:43:00,142 --> 00:43:03,002
I fully see the irony of a white
guy giving you this test,

855
00:43:03,012 --> 00:43:07,272
but ladies upstairs love a
twist, so they always send me.

856
00:43:07,282 --> 00:43:08,792
Send you to what?

857
00:43:08,802 --> 00:43:10,662
To promote you.

858
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:13,192
You're clearly ready for the next level.

859
00:43:13,202 --> 00:43:14,622
Which is?

860
00:43:14,632 --> 00:43:16,712
Secrets Taken to the Grave.

861
00:43:16,722 --> 00:43:18,892
You're gonna collect them.

862
00:43:18,902 --> 00:43:20,882
Congratulations.

863
00:43:22,122 --> 00:43:23,632
Thank you.

864
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:27,812
Oh, and, um, I'm afraid we're gonna
need you to start right away.

865
00:43:45,972 --> 00:43:47,562
Hey.

866
00:43:48,632 --> 00:43:50,502
Been a while.

867
00:43:52,192 --> 00:43:54,152
Welcome to the Underworld.
