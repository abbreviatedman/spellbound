Alice, uh, opened a pipe,

48

accidentally helped blow up
the Modesto branch,

49
00:02:21,676 --> 00:02:24,786

you've seen stories
like this before,

66

what's going to happen...

Who's important and who isn't.

68

But that's because you are
trapped in your POV.

69
00:03:11,036 --> 00:03:14,986
You have a classic case of
White Male Protagonism, Derek,

70
00:03:15,006 --> 00:03:20,976
and a Librarian simply can't have that. But
that's why these books are so important.

71
00:03:20,976 --> 00:03:26,946
They're such a gift. They... they can
allow you to see other points of view.

72
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,604
And once you start seeing that,

73
00:03:29,605 --> 00:03:32,685
you'll find that the story
doesn't end the way you think,

74
00:03:32,705 --> 00:03:36,615

characters aren't who you expect.

That has to have consequences.

Alice Quinn is an existential
threat to that knowledge.

and Nick split up, we'll lose them.

There might be another way.

00:05:44,422 --> 00:05:46,392
Tracking devices.

123
00:05:47,024 --> 00:05:49,164
Eventually, they'll go
somewhere for help.

124

There isn't enough ambient to
keep either of them happy long,

125
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,480
- so disperse a Searcher widely and...
- Disperse to whom, though?

126
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,260
I find it unlikely that
Alice or Nick will run into

127
00:05:59,261 --> 00:06:01,140
the hands of
card-carrying Magicians.

128
00:06:01,141 --> 00:06:03,320
- They'll go underground.
- Yes.

129
00:06:03,761 --> 00:06:06,971
- Where the hedge witches are.
- And the hedge witches don't trust us.

130
00:06:06,971 --> 00:06:09,801
- We'll never get them to accept...
- If we do what I'm thinking,

131
00:06:09,821 --> 00:06:12,821
they'll take them
without ever knowing.

132
00:06:14,442 --> 00:06:16,622
Fine. Trackers.

133
00:06:16,632 --> 00:06:18,572
And once Alice's book is back,

134
00:06:18,582 --> 00:06:20,572
if we can verify
she's no longer a threat,

135
00:06:20,582 --> 00:06:22,682

for further corrective action.

that people up there would
give anything to stop.

living from doing what they do.

174
00:08:08,304 --> 00:08:14,474
It's our job to appreciate their full life.
We see but do not intervene...

175
00:08:14,484 --> 00:08:16,544
for a lot of good reasons.

176
00:08:16,554 --> 00:08:21,464
I can see this is wigging you out.
Let's start with an easier one.

177
00:08:21,774 --> 00:08:24,784
Well, what's my Birthright,
you scaly shit?

178
00:08:24,794 --> 00:08:26,724
Wait...

179
00:08:26,744 --> 00:08:28,574
I read this one last week.

180
00:08:28,584 --> 00:08:31,784
High King of Fillory gets mad
at, uh, the alpaca lady,

181
00:08:31,794 --> 00:08:36,554
uh, to bring back
the talking animals' voices.

182
00:08:36,564 --> 00:08:37,764
You read Margo's story.

183
00:08:37,774 --> 00:08:39,824
This one is not about her.

184
00:08:39,834 --> 00:08:43,574
Well, what's my Birthright,
you scaly shit?

185
00:08:43,584 --> 00:08:45,744
(whooshing)

186
00:08:45,754 --> 00:08:47,694
Oh, hi, there.

187
00:08:47,704 --> 00:08:50,584
Do you have a message, or...?

188
00:08:50,594 --> 00:08:51,744
(rabbit gurgling)

189
00:08:51,754 --> 00:08:52,814
(gasps, screaming)

190
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,774
(gasps, panting)

191
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,604
Oh!
(laughing)

192
00:08:56,624 --> 00:08:58,624
Okay, it was a dream.

193
00:08:58,634 --> 00:08:59,814
Just keep reading.

194
00:08:59,824 --> 00:09:03,754
Well, what's my Birthright,
you scaly shit?

195
00:09:05,594 --> 00:09:07,554
It's the talking animals.

196
00:09:07,564 --> 00:09:10,754
They've all been struck dumb.

197
00:09:10,764 --> 00:09:13,624
Well, shit.

198
00:09:13,634 --> 00:09:16,263
All right, Fen, I think
I will do a ritual.

199
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,214
Earth specialty...
The Sleep of Solitude.

200
00:09:18,214 --> 00:09:23,304
I pop an Ambien, everyone leaves me
alone till noon. That'll be perfect.

201
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:28,629
Rafe, last night I had
the strangest dream.

202
00:09:28,629 --> 00:09:31,629
There were these bunnies
with their throats...

203
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:32,829
You know what?

204
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,859
I think I projected
the talking animals going mute.

205
00:09:35,869 --> 00:09:38,829
Okay, I think I'm starting to
get the point of these stories.

206
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:40,829
All women are just one
emotional crisis away

207
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:41,879
from a psychotic break.

208
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:43,629
Jesus, no.

209
00:09:43,629 --> 00:09:46,629
Whoa, you can't say stuff
like that anymore.

210
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:49,879
- What, in the afterlife?
- Anywhere.

211
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:53,829
Do you remember what Kady
was doing at this time?

212
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,879
Didn't she just kind of peace out
after the Library Dewey coin heist?

213
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:01,780
Not exactly. See, while the
others were busy bleeding a stone

214
00:10:01,781 --> 00:10:07,699
to stop the monster, Kady...
was busy doing something else.

215
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:11,679
Iris could have at least left us a
stone-bleeding how-to or something.

216
00:10:11,699 --> 00:10:14,629
Yeah, I hear
what you're saying, Q.

217
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:17,909
- Hey.
- Don't mind me.

218
00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:20,669
(sighs)

219
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:27,699
Uh, I'll go check those other books.
The books in, uh, Marina's library,

220
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:30,819
'cause, uh, yep, that's got
to be where they are.

221
00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:36,639
- (sighs)
- Hey. Haven't seen you in a while.

222
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:38,909
There was some stuff
I had to do.

223
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:43,889
- Stuff I should be worried about?
- I'm clean.

224
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:46,659
Good.

225
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:50,739
Who's this?

226
00:10:50,749 --> 00:10:54,629
Five weeks ago, her dad picked her
up from school and disappeared...

227
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:55,899
Custody fight with her mom.

228
00:10:55,909 --> 00:11:00,899
Locator spell and a few bruised
knuckles later, she's home.

229
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:05,669
"Five weeks ago" as in when you
were "Detective Sam Cunningham"?

230
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:08,859
- You're solving her old case files?
- All right, look...

231
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:10,899
you lived as Kim for months.

232
00:11:10,909 --> 00:11:13,659
The moment you got
your memory back, you just...

233
00:11:13,669 --> 00:11:16,819
You dropped it
like it never happened.

234
00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:19,859
(sighs) I-I can't.

235
00:11:19,869 --> 00:11:21,799
I can't go back
to being a sidekick.

236
00:11:21,819 --> 00:11:22,839
- You're not a sidekick.
- Come on.

237
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:26,699
I'm only in this group at all
because of Penny.

238
00:11:26,709 --> 00:11:28,659
That's not true.

239
00:11:28,669 --> 00:11:30,659
- You and me...
- We're friends, yeah.

240
00:11:30,669 --> 00:11:33,639
And then we weren't,
and now we're what...

241
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:34,869
I don't know,
whatever you call it when...

242
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:39,839
you have a lot of history that
made you two very different people.

243
00:11:39,849 --> 00:11:42,739
I need my own path, Jules.

244
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:46,629
I want my life to feel
like it's about me.

245
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:50,307
No, I get that.
And I am all for your personal growth.

246
00:11:50,308 --> 00:11:52,168
It's just that we're... You know,
we're kind of under the gun here.

247
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:55,359
You're under my roof,
hidden from the McAllistairs

248
00:11:55,369 --> 00:11:57,379
and the Library because I took
this place from Marina

249
00:11:57,389 --> 00:12:01,329
when everyone else wanted to
hand her nuclear launch codes.

250
00:12:03,319 --> 00:12:07,289
Look, I'll help, of course...

251
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:10,539
when I can, in my way.

252
00:12:10,549 --> 00:12:13,399
But for now...

253
00:12:13,409 --> 00:12:16,299
Sam left a few loose ends
I need to tie up.

254
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:20,289
(soft music)

255
00:12:20,289 --> 00:12:22,529
(knocking on door)

256
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:26,399
You're not my Postmate.

257
00:12:26,409 --> 00:12:28,359
(deep voice)
I am the Baba Yaga.

258
00:12:28,369 --> 00:12:31,539
You live on my property
under my protection,

259
00:12:31,539 --> 00:12:34,339
and your rent is due.

260
00:12:34,359 --> 00:12:38,329
Okay, well, this isn't
exactly my place.

261
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:40,339
Well, you're here now,

262
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:43,379
and the list is clearly posted
on the premises.

263
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:46,289
Wait, Marina's weird
grocery list on the fridge?

264
00:12:46,289 --> 00:12:47,359
It is not weird.

265
00:12:47,369 --> 00:12:49,329
You are weird.

266
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:52,409
You reek of nondairy creamer
and despair.

267
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:56,369
Okay, look, I don't have

268
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:58,289
whatever it is
that you're looking for.

269
00:12:58,299 --> 00:13:00,359
One Webster's Weeping Healer,

270
00:13:00,369 --> 00:13:02,499
one Totem of the Plump Pelican,

271
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:04,509
and one Bag of Holding.

272
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:10,389
Pay what is owed in two days'
time or wish I boiled you alive.

273
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,289
The wench will explain.

274
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:13,399
What?

275
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:16,379
(gagging, coughing)

276
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:20,369
(gasps)

277
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:22,539
(normal voice)
Holy shit, you have to pay her.

278
00:13:22,549 --> 00:13:26,045
"Her"? You mean you.
Okay, what the fuck is happening?

279
00:13:26,046 --> 00:13:30,299
I'm Bailey. Sorry about the Baba Yaga.
She can be a little... (groans)

280
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,409
The Baba's the spirit
of a vengeful Slavic witch

281
00:13:32,419 --> 00:13:34,369
I channel when I need
to collect rent

282
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:36,329
or deal with a chatty
Uber driver.

283
00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:38,339
So if you don't want to be
her next meal,

284
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,559
you should give her
what she wants.

285
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:41,389
Ooh, stressful.

286
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:44,359
Where am I supposed to find...

287
00:13:44,369 --> 00:13:45,529
Wait a minute.

288
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:46,529
Is the...

289
00:13:46,539 --> 00:13:50,289
The Totem of the Plump Pelican.

290
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:52,289
Wait, this thing?

291
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:53,449
Oh, yeah, that's it.

292
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:58,058
Oh. Marina must have found it. I just
thought it was some ugly paperweight.

293
00:13:58,059 --> 00:13:59,369
Shh, don't insult it.

294
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:00,569
It reacts.

295
00:14:01,289 --> 00:14:03,359
So two more to go.

296
00:14:03,369 --> 00:14:06,309
(sighs) Oh, shit.
She's coming back.

297
00:14:06,319 --> 00:14:09,379
(gasps, wheezes)

298
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:13,549
(deep voice) Pay me what is owed, or I
will boil your marrow into soup, peasant.

299
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:17,379
See you Thursday.

300
00:14:22,302 --> 00:14:22,412
(door bells jingle)

301
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:28,272
I'm looking for a guy
called "Lovelady."

302
00:14:28,272 --> 00:14:30,302
(door closes)
Heard he has office hours here.

303
00:14:38,315 --> 00:14:39,405
What is this?

304
00:14:39,415 --> 00:14:40,475
Some kind of flashlight spell?

305
00:14:40,485 --> 00:14:43,405
Isik.

306
00:14:43,415 --> 00:14:45,485
(chuckles)

307
00:14:50,355 --> 00:14:51,905
(speaking Aramaic)

308
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,080
- Jesus.
- Whoa!

309
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,960
Satisfied?

310
00:14:55,382 --> 00:14:56,287
What the hell was that?

311
00:14:56,288 --> 00:14:58,285
I never want to see the floor
of a bar that bright.

312
00:14:58,296 --> 00:15:00,046
Pete?

313
00:15:00,056 --> 00:15:02,316
(scoffs)
Wait, you're Lovelady?

314
00:15:02,326 --> 00:15:04,236
Oh, shit.

315
00:15:04,246 --> 00:15:06,096
Kady.

316
00:15:06,116 --> 00:15:07,296
It's been a while.

317
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:10,196
Last time I saw you,
you were with Marina.

318
00:15:10,206 --> 00:15:11,326
Mm.

319
00:15:11,792 --> 00:15:13,402
We parted ways.
It was mutual.

320
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:15,425
Mm, I'm sure.

321
00:15:16,962 --> 00:15:20,080
- So "Lovelady," huh?
- It's a title.

322
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:21,309
When one guy's done with it,

323
00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:24,441
he passes it on to the next guy,
kind of like "Dread Pirate Roberts"

324
00:15:24,443 --> 00:15:25,503
or "Senator."

325
00:15:25,513 --> 00:15:28,473
That's not how Senators work.

326
00:15:28,483 --> 00:15:30,443
Whatever.

327
00:15:30,453 --> 00:15:32,393
The guy who was "Lovelady
before me

328
00:15:32,403 --> 00:15:34,533
is an Earl
with a private island.

329
00:15:34,543 --> 00:15:36,443
People respect
the shit out of me.

330
00:15:36,453 --> 00:15:39,413
It's a great sign when
you have to tell people that.

331
00:15:39,423 --> 00:15:43,483
Did you come here looking
for my help or...?

332
00:15:43,503 --> 00:15:45,593
Sorry.

333
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:47,473
(sighs)

334
00:15:47,483 --> 00:15:52,503
Here's a list.
I heard you can find things.

335
00:15:52,513 --> 00:15:55,583
Interesting stuff.
Specific.

336
00:15:55,593 --> 00:15:58,383
Landlord issue.

337
00:15:58,393 --> 00:15:59,393
Have you considered moving?

338
00:15:59,403 --> 00:16:02,333
The place has special features.

339
00:16:02,343 --> 00:16:04,393
It just turns out it's courtesy
of a-a witch...

340
00:16:04,403 --> 00:16:07,583
- Uh, Baba-something.
- You mean the Baba Yaga?

341
00:16:07,593 --> 00:16:11,433
- You know her?
- Just by reputation.

342
00:16:11,443 --> 00:16:13,483
Hey, if I help you,

343
00:16:13,503 --> 00:16:17,483
in lieu of my usual fee,
I want you to introduce me.

344
00:16:17,503 --> 00:16:21,313
- Not sure she's your type.
- She's got great taste.

345
00:16:21,323 --> 00:16:25,403
This could open up
a whole new avenue for me.

346
00:16:25,413 --> 00:16:29,513
Yeah, fine, whatever.
You'll help?

347
00:16:29,523 --> 00:16:33,483
One more thing.
Um, do you still see Julia?

348
00:16:33,503 --> 00:16:35,523
Don't be a creep, Pete.

349
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:37,513
Where are we going?

350
00:16:39,433 --> 00:16:41,403
Black Market.

351
00:16:41,413 --> 00:16:44,443
So Kady's moved on.

352
00:16:44,453 --> 00:16:47,363
I mean, not with Pete, just...

353
00:16:47,383 --> 00:16:51,433
I know what you mean,
and I'm happy for her.

354
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:53,443
You don't look happy.

355
00:16:53,453 --> 00:16:59,259
So is there some sort of connection
I'm supposed to be seeing between Kady,

356
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,390
Zelda, Fen...

357
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,290
You'll see.

358
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,250
Alice's book had been revised,

359
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:09,190
but Alice had changed
the ending.

360
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,200
- Well?
- Apparently, Alice feels

361
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:13,290
magic has caused her
nothing but trouble.

362
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,290
She goes on to live out

363
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,370
an entirely civilian life
in Portland.

364
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,220
She just got a job
at a craft brewery,

365
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,370
and a Shih Tzu.

366
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,300
You look a little surprised.

367
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,300
Does that not sound like her?

368
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,240
The choice is unexpected, but...

369
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,350
wouldn't be the first time
she walked away from magic.

370
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,300
Great, then.

371
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,310
Nick is still at large,

372
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,380
so we'll keep our trackers
in circulation,

373
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:38,330
but I think we can close
the book on Alice Quinn.

374
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,400
It's funny...

375
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,340
I'd always thought
she was a cat person.

376
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,380
Never seen her before.
Sorry.

377
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:50,250
She would be a new hire.

378
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,310
(sighs)
We're not hiring right now.

379
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,300
In fact, we've had
to let some people go.

380
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:57,160
Designer hops

381

382
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,250
Well?

383
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:08,180
Alice is inside,
as her book said.

384
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:11,160
Hmm.
Good riddance, book tart.

385
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,320
Let's go get some doughnuts.

386
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,350
This is the Black Market?

387
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,360
It's so...
Normal?

388
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,290
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

389
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,190
You'd be surprised
what you can find in here.

390
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,410
Even Deweys.

391
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,370
Wait, I thought you had to
have a Library card for that?

392
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:32,180
Yeah, well, the Library
should know better

393
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:34,220
than to give
unlimited black cards

394
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,230
to rich druggie dickbags

395
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,300
that trade them in
for lap dances.

396
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,260
Oh, so you give lap dances, huh?

397
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,210
Selectively.

398
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,320
Okay, so that is Whitley.

399
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,200
If she does not have
a Bag of Holding,

400
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,350
she'll have a line on one.

401
00:18:47,757 --> 00:18:48,807
What, you're not gonna
introduce me?

402
00:18:48,817 --> 00:18:51,737
Well, I may have
had sex with her

403
00:18:51,747 --> 00:18:52,932
and never called her again.

404
00:18:52,933 --> 00:18:54,923

00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:58,033

he steals from the kitchen,

500

Sounds like a personal problem.

524
00:24:17,908 --> 00:24:20,838
Henry, please.

525
00:24:20,848 --> 00:24:22,748
I'm trusting you.

526
00:24:22,758 --> 00:24:24,748
What you mean is that you trust

527
00:24:24,748 --> 00:24:25,958
that I won't report this

528
00:24:25,968 --> 00:24:27,938
because it'd be worse for Alice.

529
00:24:27,948 --> 00:24:29,898
We both want to spare her that.

530
00:24:29,908 --> 00:24:31,758
If you could just tell me
where she is...

531
00:24:31,768 --> 00:24:35,028

Which personal enchantment?

553
00:26:12,423 --> 00:26:14,263
I don't know.
They're personal.

554
00:26:14,804 --> 00:26:16,944
Hedge spells, you know,
they're off the street at best.

555
00:26:16,954 --> 00:26:18,764
They got a lot of rough edges.

There's really no telling

So help him,
or I break your jaw.

560
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:30,200
Look, the only human
diagnostic spell I know

561
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,620
costs magic, and I'm a little
Dewey-light at the mo...

Please don't break my jaw.

Pete has one he took off
your friend Duke.

Wait. Wait, you said
something's clashing with Pete.

- Like a cursed object.

00:26:45,615 --> 00:26:47,585
I once treated a horse
for strangles.

569
00:26:47,595 --> 00:26:49,615
Turns out jockey's riding crop
interacted badly

570
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:51,795
with a hoof-protection
spell, so...

571
00:26:51,805 --> 00:26:53,815
Does Pete carry a riding crop?

572
00:26:53,825 --> 00:26:56,735
Okay, maybe just look at this.

What?
It's more accurate than lenses.

578
00:27:04,765 --> 00:27:05,745
You can taste cobalt.

579
00:27:05,755 --> 00:27:07,655
It's used in most
tracking spells.

580
00:27:07,665 --> 00:27:08,805
- "Tracking spells"?
- Mm-hmm.

581
00:27:08,815 --> 00:27:10,065
I put them on pets.

582
00:27:10,069 --> 00:27:11,805
This one tastes like
a real expensive Searcher.

583
00:27:11,806 --> 00:27:14,210
You hold it long enough,
it kind of sends out

584
00:27:14,211 --> 00:27:16,151
a signal to whoever cast it.

585
00:27:16,161 --> 00:27:19,680
- Wait, a-a signal to wh... who?
- Aliens.

586
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:21,691
I was thinking more like
who makes Deweys.

587
00:27:22,411 --> 00:27:24,061
- The Library.
- Oh, yeah.

588
00:27:24,411 --> 00:27:25,631
That makes more sense.

589
00:27:25,641 --> 00:27:27,691
Who's the Library looking for?

590
00:27:28,411 --> 00:27:29,661
Oh, I can think of a few people.

591
00:27:29,671 --> 00:27:32,611
Wait, how many hedges have
these personal enchantments?

592
00:27:32,621 --> 00:27:34,631
Pretty much everybody.

593
00:27:34,641 --> 00:27:36,431
Shit.

594
00:27:36,441 --> 00:27:38,451
Take off all of Pete's, now.

595
00:27:38,461 --> 00:27:39,661
What are you gonna do?

596
00:27:39,671 --> 00:27:41,611
I'm gonna warn everybody.

597
00:27:41,621 --> 00:27:42,661
Wait a second.

598
00:27:42,671 --> 00:27:45,641
So the Library's responsible
for hedge witches dying?

599
00:27:45,651 --> 00:27:47,641
Yeah, but they don't
know that yet.

600
00:27:47,651 --> 00:27:49,561
Spoiler alert.

601
00:27:49,571 --> 00:27:51,591
Zelda had some other things
on her mind at the time.

602
00:27:51,601 --> 00:27:53,431
Her dead daughter.

603
00:27:53,441 --> 00:27:56,481
Wait, is she, like, down here?

604
00:27:56,491 --> 00:27:59,431
I thought you didn't
like spoilers.

605
00:27:59,686 --> 00:28:00,926
Look, I'm sorry
you see dead people,

606
00:28:00,936 --> 00:28:02,886
but that is
an incredibly stupid idea.

607
00:28:02,896 --> 00:28:05,419
She's not dead.
Ghosts don't bleed.

608
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:08,406
I don't know how,
but she could be alive stuck in there.

609
00:28:08,407 --> 00:28:10,387
That's insane...
And impossible.

610
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:11,527
It's the Mirror Realm.

611
00:28:11,537 --> 00:28:14,417
We don't know what's impossible.

612
00:28:14,427 --> 00:28:16,417
It's not as complicated
as a mirror bridge.

613
00:28:16,427 --> 00:28:18,547
We just need to open a door
to the place between mirrors.

614
00:28:18,557 --> 00:28:20,417
Listen, Zelds,
if you told me you wanted

615
00:28:20,427 --> 00:28:22,337
to finger-paint your blood
so you could take a walk

616
00:28:22,347 --> 00:28:24,557

I would say, "Free country."

Yes, I know that.

621
00:28:32,397 --> 00:28:34,437

She knew my soufflé was gonna
fall before that ever happened.

681
00:31:51,467 --> 00:31:53,980
- It's a stupid fucking premonition.
- You want to risk the life of your lizard,

682
00:31:53,981 --> 00:31:56,191
or is that a relationship you're
willing to set fire to as well?

683
00:31:56,201 --> 00:31:58,041
Oh, I'll fucking fry
this lizard.

684
00:31:58,061 --> 00:32:00,470
Okay, can we...
can we focus for one minute?

- Yes.

00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:30,530
you tell us
where this green bitch went.

698
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:33,590
Well, in my dream,
I chased her to this stream

699
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,500
by the Fuschia Forest
of Corian's Land.

700
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:38,580
(gasps) Corian's Land...

701
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:41,460
also known as Sloth's Bane.

702
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:44,430
I don't know what everything
in my dreams means... mean.

703
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:49,510
Anyway, I know that the answers to our
questions... Answers lie... lay there?

704
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,460
(laughs)
I-I'm not usually the one

705
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,570
who gives the big speech, so I'm...
I'm going.

706
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,590
So that... that's happening.

707
00:33:02,621 --> 00:33:02,681
(groans)

708
00:33:04,501 --> 00:33:06,491
Gordy says "you're welcome."

709
00:33:06,501 --> 00:33:08,531
And he left you a bill.

710
00:33:08,541 --> 00:33:11,661
That guy puts a really
high value on his time.

711
00:33:14,601 --> 00:33:16,601
Wait, did I miss the Baba Yaga?

712
00:33:16,621 --> 00:33:18,671
Well, you snooze, you lose.

713
00:33:18,681 --> 00:33:21,491
I wasn't snoozing, I was dying.

714
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:23,701
We got bigger fish to fry.

715
00:33:23,711 --> 00:33:28,501
I'll explain everything as soon as
your hedge witch friends get here.

I know every instinct is telling
you not to trust me... or anyone.

718
00:33:35,711 --> 00:33:39,491
But someone put a tracker on this.

719
00:33:39,501 --> 00:33:43,691
It's a complex, expensive,
very high-level spell.

720
00:33:49,771 --> 00:33:51,621
It marked him.

721
00:33:51,621 --> 00:33:55,501
It looks like the Deweys you touched
are doing the same to you. (People gasp)

722
00:33:55,521 --> 00:33:57,541
If you have any
enchantments running...

723
00:33:57,561 --> 00:34:00,621
Anything you got in a safe house,
anything homebrewed... It could kill you...

724
00:34:00,641 --> 00:34:04,491
just like it did to Duke
and almost did to Pete.

725
00:34:05,621 --> 00:34:10,371
She saved my life.
I trust her, and I vouch for her.

They're trying to find someone,

and we're just
collateral damage.

731
00:34:23,349 --> 00:34:26,329
So ask yourselves...
If this is what they do

732
00:34:26,329 --> 00:34:29,329

thinking about us,

733
