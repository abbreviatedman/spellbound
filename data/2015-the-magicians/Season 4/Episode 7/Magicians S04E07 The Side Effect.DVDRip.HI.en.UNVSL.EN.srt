PENNY: <i>Previously

00:00:03,303 --> 00:00:05,204
Look, just go, while
you still have the chance.

00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:13,079
<i>This one has a leak.</i>

6
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:18,513
Well, what's my
birthright, you scaly shit?

7
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:21,487
It's the talking animals.
They've all been struck dumb.

8
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:22,716
So what is this?

9
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:24,451
I saved your
fucking life, bitch.

10
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,388
Margo, are you okay?

11
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:29,395
You're just a
brown-nose sweater boy

12
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,021
desperate to matter at all.

13
00:00:31,098 --> 00:00:32,396

20
00:00:45,345 --> 00:00:46,422
I'm in the Underworld Library.

21
00:00:46,446 --> 00:00:48,176
If you stay down here,

22
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:50,615

me? Mr. Adiyodi?

24
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:18,472
Come in. Have a seat.

25
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:20,506
Is...

26
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:23,780
Did I do something wrong?

27
00:01:23,884 --> 00:01:25,684
I called you in to talk
about Matilda Fremont.

28
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:28,318
You shelved her
book yesterday under

29
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:29,788
"Disappointing Prodigies"?

30
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,358
Oh, right. Uh,

31
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,418
mastered the flute at seven,
but became a mediocre poet.

32
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:35,528
Unremarkable.

33
00:01:35,629 --> 00:01:36,909
Did you read her brother's book?

34
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:38,723
She saved his life.

35
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,064
Pulled him out of a
self-destructive spiral,

36
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:44,901
and he went on to become one of
the world's greatest philanthropists.

37
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,507
I wouldn't call that
"unremarkable."

38
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:53,078
Okay. So, is there section
for "Sisters of Generous Men"?

39
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,683
You've been in the Underworld
branch, um, three weeks?

40
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,562
Well... (SIGHS) PENNY:
Yeah, when I died,

41
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:03,751
all I cared about was getting
back up there, and all this?

42
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,324
I didn't think it mattered.

43
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:09,063
Where a book goes, who reads it.

44
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:13,093
Those books I lent you, you
get a chance to read them?

45
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,293
DEREK: Of course.

46
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:16,494
Well, I skimmed.

47
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,963
How far did you get?

48
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:19,870
Alice, uh, opened a pipe,

49
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,169
accidentally helped blow
up the Modesto branch,

50
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:25,541
and Quentin played
<i>Pictionary</i> with a mummy.

51
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:27,940
Where would you file them?

52
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,176
DEREK: Quentin and Alice,

53
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:32,650
"Star-Crossed Romances,"
probably, or "Well-Meaning Failures."

54
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:34,713
What about the others?

55
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:36,182
Oh.

56
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,019
"Side Characters
in Epic Quests."

57
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,354
I'm a side character?

58
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,659
DEREK: Look,
no offense. It's just,

59
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:45,288
Quentin's the center
of the whole thing.

60
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,334
He's the one that
knows everybody.

61
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:49,045
He's the one the
little British girl picked

62
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:50,469
to save the world.

63
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,571
Or he's the one
that looks like you.

64
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:54,833
Not fair.

65
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:58,105
Todd looks like me.
He's not the center of shit.

66
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,339
But he could be.

67
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:03,675
All I'm saying is you think
you've seen stories like this before,

68
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:06,219
so you can guess
what's going to happen.

69
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,016
Who's important and who isn't.

70
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:12,024
But that's because you
are trapped in your POV.

71
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:16,118
You have a classic case of
White Male Protagonism, Derek,

72
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,132
and a Librarian
simply can't have that.

73
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,968
But that's why these
books are so important.

74
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,230
They're such a gift.

75
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,366
They can allow you to
see other points of view.

76
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:29,839
And once you start seeing that,

77
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:33,573
you'll find that the story
doesn't end the way you think,

78
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,983
<i>and the most important
characters aren't who you expect.</i>

79
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,854
<i>Remember back before
all the stuff in Modesto</i>

80
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:47,258
<i>when Alice first
escaped from the Library?</i>

81
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:49,753
Oh, dear.

82
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:54,166
I'm telling you, I saw a
reindeer-driven sleigh fly away.

83
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:57,536
Alice and Nick are
gone. This is not funny.

84
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:01,569
I'm not laughing now. I mean...

85
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,199
Let's discuss next steps.

86
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:05,745
Mmm. We should wait for
Everett. He'll know how to...

87
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:07,337
Oh, he'll agree
with me when I say

88
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:09,076
that Alice Quinn
was your project.

89
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,950
Holding her here was a
mistake. We aren't jailers.

90
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:13,881
What would you have done?

91
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,079
Alice broke her deal with us.

92
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:20,219
She tried to turn off all of magic.
That has to have consequences.

93
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,395
Our mission is to preserve
the knowledge of magic.

94
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:26,297
Alice Quinn is an existential
threat to that knowledge.

95
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,425
Are you suggesting that
we should have killed her,

96
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:31,703
and Santa Claus?

97
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:32,772
(CHUCKLES)

98
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,768
I'm so sorry. It's
not at all funny.

99
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,778
Do you agree with Cyrus?

100
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:42,148
I see.

101
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:47,151
I admit, I took a personal
interest in Alice's rehabilitation.

102
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,855
Perhaps it biased me.

103
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:52,790
You are correct.
We are not jailers.

104
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,994
Nor are we killers.

105
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,895
So, I'll ask again. What
would you have us do?

106
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,764
EVERETT: "Protect the flame
of knowledge no matter the cost."

107
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:04,805
I believe that's how
the old motto goes.

108
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:06,462
CYRUS: Everett.

109
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:07,836
Sorry I was delayed.

110
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,176
The renovation of our Rome
branch ran into some difficulties.

111
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:12,906
Have you been briefed on Alice?

112
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:13,979
I agree with Zelda.

113
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,417
We are an order of
scholars, not assassins.

114
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:20,454
So, what is the
scholarly solution?

115
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,115
Read their books.
Learn their intentions.

116
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,285
We agreed not to breach privacy
unless there was no other option.

117
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:27,520
What's the other option?

118
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,962
Uh, okay.

119
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:36,060
Well, Nick's book has been
taken and presumably destroyed,

120
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:40,072
but Alice's is still in the Revision
Room having the ending put in.

121
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:41,573
CYRUS: Which will take days,

122
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,507
and if she and Nick
split up, we'll lose them.

123
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:45,470
ZELDA: There
might be another way.

124
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:47,242
Tracking devices.

125
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:50,010
Eventually, they'll go
somewhere for help.

126
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:53,281
There isn't enough ambient to
keep either of them happy long,

127
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:56,016
so disperse a
Searcher widely and...

128
00:05:56,122 --> 00:05:57,681
Disperse to whom, though?

129
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,488
I find it unlikely that Alice
or Nick will run into the hands

130
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,994
of card-carrying Magicians.

131
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,921
They'll go underground. Yes.

132
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:05,641
Where the hedge witches are.

133
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:07,896
And the hedge
witches don't trust us.

134
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,281
We'll never get
them to accept...

135
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:12,329
If we do what I'm thinking, they'll
take them without ever knowing.

136
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:17,334
Fine. Trackers.

137
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,543
And once Alice's book is back,

138
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:21,638
if we can verify she's
no longer a threat,

139
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:23,980
there'd be no need for
further corrective action.

140
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:25,351
Agreed?

141
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:30,615
All in favor?

144
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,996
Thank you, but I'm fine.

145
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,437
I understand.

146
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:50,034
I see something of
Harriet in Alice, too.

147
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:54,275
I wish you'd given yourself some
real time to grieve your daughter.

148
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:57,044

even. No, I'm...

Excuse me, I have a meeting.

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

159
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:30,983
So, you're telling me
the Head Librarian,

160
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,883
a member of the Governing
Council of The Order,

161
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,422
is having a nervous breakdown?

162
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,184
Trust me, just 'cause
she's seeing shit

163
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,314
that no one else sees

164
00:07:38,425 --> 00:07:39,735
doesn't mean it
isn't really there.

165
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,160
Then we got to get a
message to this Everett guy.

166
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:43,423
He's in charge, right?

167
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,397
Can't. What do you mean?

168
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,977
There's a dragon that connects
the Underworld to the Neitherlands.

169
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:50,095
We just take a note,
and we shove it up his...

170
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,332
Not how that works.

171
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:55,839
Look, being down here...
You mean being dead?

172
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:59,009
It gives you a new perspective.

173
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:00,632
There's shit we know
is going to happen

174
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,013
that people up there
would give anything to stop.

175
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:05,413
But we can see

00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:03,625
The place has special features.

353
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,093
It just turns out it's
courtesy of a witch.

354
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,293
A Baba-something.

355
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:09,960
You mean the Baba Yaga?

356
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:12,702
You know her?
Just by reputation.

357
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,403
Hey, if I help you, in
lieu of my usual fee,

358
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:19,776
I want you to introduce me.

359
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:23,248
Not sure she's your
type. She's got great taste.

360
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:26,150
This could open up a
whole new avenue for me.

361
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:28,914
Yeah, fine, whatever.

362
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:29,988
You'll help?

363
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,421
One more thing. Um,

364
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,121
do you still see Julia?

365
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,721
Don't be a creep, Pete.

366
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:39,290
Where are we going?

367
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:42,434
The Black Market.

369
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:49,267
I mean, not with Pete, just...

370
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,970
I know what you mean,

371
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:52,534
and I'm happy for her.

372
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:54,976
You don't look happy.

373
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:58,216
So, is there some
sort of connection

374
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:01,481
I'm supposed to be
seeing between Kady,

375

376
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,357
You'll see.

378
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:10,392
<i>but Alice had
changed the ending.</i>

EVERETT: Well?

380
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:15,660
Apparently, Alice feels magic
has caused her nothing but trouble.

381
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:19,001
She goes on to live out an
entirely civilian life in Portland.

382
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:22,906
She just got a job at a craft
brewery, and a Shih Tzu.

383
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,837
You look a little surprised.

384
00:17:24,911 --> 00:17:26,504
Does that not sound like her?

385
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:29,413
The choice is unexpected,

386
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:32,246
but wouldn't be the first time
she walked away from magic.

387
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,052
Great, then.

388
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:38,050
Nick is still at large, so we'll
keep our trackers in circulation,

389
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,786
but I think we can close
the book on Alice Quinn.

390
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,260
It's funny,

391
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,422
I'd always thought
she was a cat person.

MAN: Never seen
her before. Sorry.

393
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,432
She would be a new hire.

394
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:54,598
(SIGHS) We're
not hiring right now.

395
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:56,573
In fact, we've had to
let some people go.

397

Well?

398
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:10,213

as her book said.

This is the Black

402
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,732
Yeah. Exactly.

403
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:27,740
You'd be surprised
what you can find in here.

Even Deweys.

405
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,238
Wait, I thought you had to
have a Library card for that?

406
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:36,407
Yeah, well, the Library should know
better than to give unlimited Black Cards

407
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:39,611
to rich druggie dickbags that
trade them in for lap dances.

408
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,745
Oh, so, you give
lap dances, huh?

409
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:42,821
Selectively.

410
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,924
Okay, so that is Whitley.

411
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:49,895
If she does not have a Bag of
Holding, she'll have a line on one.

412

gonna introduce me?

413
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,856
Well, I may have
had sex with her

414
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,127

eat kraken, so I don't eat kraken.

Mmm-hmm. Not bad.

00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:39,069
I comply with every request,

528
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:42,572
all your red tape and
your triplicate bullshit.

529
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:48,587
This is your mess.
Do not drag me into it.

530
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,681
(TINNITUS RINGING)

531
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:10,503
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

532
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,206
Harriet?

533
00:25:15,314 --> 00:25:16,714
(INAUDIBLE)

534
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,822
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

535
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,469
I don't think an ancient Slavic
witch is gonna want a mojito.

536
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:46,705
Right. Um...

537
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:49,012
Something vodka-based?

538
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:51,182
Are you actually nervous?

539
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:54,186
Baba Yaga's a really big
deal in my line of work, and...

540
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:55,986
First impressions...

541
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,918
What was I saying?
Pete, your arm.

542
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:06,422
That molest-y hand
gave me the clap.

543
00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:08,592
Oh, shit.

544
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,648
GORDY: Looks like
a bad spell interaction.

545
00:26:13,672 --> 00:26:16,267
Something's clashing with one
of his personal enchantments.

546
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:17,536
Which personal enchantment?

547
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,043
I don't know. They're personal.

548
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:22,271
Hedge spells, you know,
they're off the street at best.

549
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:23,610
They got a lot of rough edges.

550
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:25,875
There's really no telling
if they'll play nice together

551
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,944
until, well, they don't.

552
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:30,249
Whatever killed
Duke is killing him.

553
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:33,223
So, help him, or
I break your jaw.

554
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:36,057
Look, the only human diagnostic
spell I know costs magic,

555
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:37,605
and I'm a little
Dewey-light at the mo.

556
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:38,892
Please don't break my jaw.

557
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:40,926
Fine.

558
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:43,400
Pete has one he took
off your dead friend Duke.

559
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:46,928
Wait. Wait, you said
something's clashing with Pete.

560
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,039
Mmm.

561
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,542
Like what? Like a cursed object.

562
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,441
I once treated a
horse for strangles.

563
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,513
Turns out jockey's riding
crop interacted badly

564
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,411
with a hoof-protection
spell, so...

565
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:58,951
Does Pete carry a riding crop?

566
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:01,019
Okay, maybe just look at this.

567
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:03,914
(SPITS)

568
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:05,821
Cobalt. Don't touch that shit.

569
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:08,189
Not really planning to
now that you licked it.

570
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,921
What? It's more
accurate than lenses.

571
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:12,555
You can taste cobalt. It's
used in most tracking spells.

572
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,964
Tracking spells? Mmm.
I put them on pets.

573
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:16,934
This one tastes like a
real expensive Searcher.

574
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:20,803
You hold it long enough, it kind of
sends out a signal to whoever cast it.

575
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:24,468
Wait, a signal to who? Aliens.

576
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:26,702
I was thinking more
like who makes Deweys.

577
00:27:27,446 --> 00:27:29,347
The Library. Oh, yeah.

578
00:27:29,448 --> 00:27:30,746
That makes more sense.

579
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:32,742
Who's the Library looking for?

580
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:35,049
Oh, I can think of a few people.

581
00:27:35,554 --> 00:27:37,921
Wait, how many hedges have
these personal enchantments?

582
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,959
Pretty much everybody.

583
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,152
Shit.

584
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,456
Take off all of Pete's, now.

585
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:44,553
What are you gonna do?

586
00:27:45,297 --> 00:27:46,595
I'm gonna warn everybody.

587
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:50,967
Wait a second. So, the Library's
responsible for hedge witches dying?

588
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:53,005
Yeah, but they
don't know that yet.

589
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:54,403
Spoiler alert.

590
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,975
Zelda had some other
things on her mind at the time.

591
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:58,305
Her dead daughter.

592
00:27:58,377 --> 00:28:00,039
Wait, is she, like, down here?

593
00:28:01,813 --> 00:28:03,509
I thought you
didn't like spoilers.

594
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:08,178
Look, I'm sorry you see dead people,
but that is an incredibly stupid idea.

595
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:10,483
She's not dead.
Ghosts don't bleed.

596
00:28:10,556 --> 00:28:13,390
I don't know how, but she
could be alive, stuck in there.

597
00:28:13,492 --> 00:28:15,324
That's insane, and impossible.

598
00:28:15,394 --> 00:28:16,760
It's the Mirror Realm.

599
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:18,626
We don't know what's impossible.

600
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:21,733
It's not as complicated
as a mirror bridge.

601
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:24,045
We just need to open a door
to the place between mirrors.

602
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:25,662
Listen, Zelds, if you
told me you wanted

603
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:28,383
to finger-paint your blood so you
could take a walk in the crazy dimension,

604
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:30,069
I would say, "Free country."

605
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:31,336
But this is my blood.

606
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,704
I can't do this
without your help.

607
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,209
Yes, I know that.

608
00:28:37,683 --> 00:28:39,675
And I'm leaving.
She's my daughter.

609
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:43,378
Harriet,

610
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:45,885
who's older than you?

611
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:49,352
Our relationship is complicated.

612
00:28:49,428 --> 00:28:50,428
Clearly.

613
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,664
You smashed the mirror.

614
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:54,391
You

615
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:56,395
trapped her there.

616
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:58,470
I was doing my job. I can't

617
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:04,074
live with myself if I don't
find a way to help her.

618
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,006
Please.

619
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,744
Christ.

620
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,013
I'm gonna regret this, aren't I?

621
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,757
Did you juice the beets?
Oh, I juiced the beets.

622
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:25,524
I told you I would
juice the beets.

623
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,395
Why wouldn't I juice the beets?

624
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:28,900
Don't make this about us.

625
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:30,287
DEREK: <i>Wait, did
I miss something?</i>

626
00:29:30,669 --> 00:29:34,800
I thought Margo and Josh were
an unlikely yet heartwarming thing.

627
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:37,307
No, this is after the
Lady Pike incident.

628
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:39,902
Margo called Josh a sweater boy.

629
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:41,439
Forget it.

630
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:42,775
Pay attention to Fen.

631
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:44,681
MARGO: How's this shit work?

632
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:47,953
Pour it gently onto the
lizard, Your Majesty.

633
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:59,129
(LIZARD SCREECHES)

634
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,434
Jesus lizard-fucking Christ!

635
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:09,104
Does this feel like a weird
sort of dream to any of you?

636
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,040
All right, maybe
I can control this.

637
00:30:23,689 --> 00:30:27,148
Ember's balls. This is a dream.

638
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:31,489
Okay, okay. Stop talking
to yourself and look around.

639
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:34,956
Hey!

640
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:36,126
Who are you?

641
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:38,102
Wait, no! Stop, please!

642
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,604
Freeze! Freeze!

643
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,367
Hey, hey, stop!

644
00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:43,840
Freeze! Green lady! Hold up!

645
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:45,400
Hey, Green lady, come back!

646
00:30:50,382 --> 00:30:52,817
Umber's ass, this
is getting annoying.

647
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:04,795
Hey, wait!

648
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:07,165
Wait, I just want to talk!

649
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,364
Why am I having
these stupid dreams?

650
00:31:09,468 --> 00:31:12,131
(GASPS) Oh, no. The lizard.

651
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,572
You pour it gently onto
the lizard, Your Majesty.

652
00:31:15,674 --> 00:31:17,336
Wait, stop! It'll catch fire!

653
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:18,968
The fuck?

654
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:23,243
I saw the lizard
blow up when Rafe...

655
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:25,610
Antidote.

656
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:28,185
What is she talking about?

657
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:32,190
Perhaps she's mad with grief over
the loss of King Eliot, Your Majesty.

658
00:31:32,257 --> 00:31:34,817
I assure you, all the animals
have responded quite positively

659
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:35,917
to the antidote.

660
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:37,307
Well, this one definitely won't.

661
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,399
Fwoosh! Fried lizard.

662
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:43,592
And where are you
getting this information?

663
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,068
I... I dreamt it.

664
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:54,074
Fen has been having
kinda prophetic dreams.

665
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:56,391
She knew my soufflé was gonna
fall before that ever happened.

666
00:31:56,415 --> 00:31:57,883
It's a stupid
fucking premonition.

667
00:31:57,949 --> 00:31:59,093
You want to risk
the life of your lizard,

668
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:01,262
or is that a relationship you're
willing to set fire to as well?

669
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:02,584
Oh, I'll fucking
fry this lizard.

670
00:32:02,687 --> 00:32:05,247
Okay, can we focus
for one minute?

671
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:06,347
Sure. Yes.

672
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:07,620
Fine. Let's.

673
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:08,726
Cool. Great.

674
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:09,794
MARGO: Okay.

675
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:13,593
Say I don't dose Newt
Scamander with beet juice.

676
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:16,601
How the shit am I supposed
to get his wrinkly ass talking?

677
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:19,637
I don't know, but I have an
idea of where to look for answers.

678
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,769
I lucid-dreamed.

679
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:25,274
I saw a woman in a green hood.

680
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,772
She has to be the one
giving me premonitions.

681
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:29,142
Awesome. You got it working.

682
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:30,613
A-plus. B-minus.

683
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:32,913
Unless,

684
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:35,613
you tell us where
this green bitch went.

685
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:38,816
Well, in my dream, I
chased her to this stream

686
00:32:38,924 --> 00:32:41,553
by the Fuchsia Forest
of Corian's Land.

687
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,288
(GASPS) Corian's Land,

688
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:45,625
also known as Sloth's Bane.

689
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:49,430
I don't know what everything
in my dreams means... Mean.

690
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:50,560
Anyway,

691
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:53,070
I know that the answers
to our questions...

692
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:55,471
Answers lie... Lay
there? (CHUCKLES)

693
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:58,908
I'm not usually the one who
gives the big speech, so I'm going.

694
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,969
So, that's happening.

695
00:33:11,456 --> 00:33:12,856
KADY: Gordy says,
"You're welcome."

696
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:14,790
And he left you a bill.

697
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:18,022
That guy puts a really
high value on his time.

698
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,563
Wait, did I miss the Baba Yaga?

699
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:25,830
Well, you snooze, you lose.

700
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:28,133
I wasn't snoozing, I was dying.

701
00:33:28,206 --> 00:33:29,640
We got bigger fish to fry.

702
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:32,635
I'll explain everything

703
00:33:32,711 --> 00:33:34,805
as soon as your hedge
witch friends get here.

704
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:42,478
I know every instinct is telling
you not to trust me, or anyone.

705
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:45,589
But someone put
a tracker on this.

706
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:50,562
It's a complex, expensive,
very high-level spell.

707
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:57,827
It marked him.

708
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:01,150
It looks like the Deweys you
touched are doing the same to you.

709
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,334
If you have any
enchantments running,

710
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:05,653
anything you got
in a safe house,

711
00:34:05,677 --> 00:34:07,703
anything home-brewed,
it could kill you,

712
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:11,238
just like it did to Duke,
and almost did to Pete.

713
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:14,051
She saved my life.

714
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:16,982
I trust her, and
I vouch for her.

715
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,820
Who did this? The Library.

716
00:34:20,926 --> 00:34:22,803
They make the Deweys,
and they don't give a shit

717
00:34:22,827 --> 00:34:24,420
about what happens
to the hedges.

718
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:26,503
They're trying to find someone,

719
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:29,494
and we're just
collateral damage.

720
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:31,865
So, ask yourselves,

721
00:34:31,937 --> 00:34:35,032
if this is what they do when
they're not even thinking about us,

722
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,399
what happens when
they decide we're a threat?

723
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:45,081
<i>Are we just gonna let people like
them tell us we're not important?</i>

724
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:52,184
<i>That we're just some side characters
in their fucked-up fascist plot?</i>

725
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:55,459
My mom was a hedge,

726
00:34:57,395 --> 00:35:00,024
and she was killed
by another hedge.

727
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:03,762
You'd think that would
turn me against you.

728
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,201
But it didn't.

729
00:35:08,974 --> 00:35:11,808
It just made me realize that
it doesn't have to be this way.

730
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:15,107
If we could stop
screwing each other over

731
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:17,409
long enough to work together,

732
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:20,077
then it's not the
Library's story.

733
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:23,311
It's our story.

Hey. Hey.

00:35:31,563 --> 00:35:33,464
I have a buddy in Modesto.

736
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:36,057
He says there's a
leaky Library pipe there.

737

those assholes pay.

you're going through...

kill your boyfriend?

740
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:44,573

out what to do next.

742

You do that, you're giving
them a reason to wipe us out.

sleep. We'll talk tomorrow.
