1
00:00:06,516 --> 00:00:08,576
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:08,586 --> 00:00:11,916
So this book is used to help
relocate different worlds

3
00:00:11,926 --> 00:00:13,190
via a cooperative spell?

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,713
Well, it is called the World Book.

5
00:00:14,724 --> 00:00:17,382
Okay, there's a spell in here
that will tell me where

6
00:00:17,393 --> 00:00:19,291
I'm supposed to go, and I will
stay there for good, okay?

7
00:00:19,302 --> 00:00:20,430
Just let me help you.

8
00:00:20,441 --> 00:00:22,739
This is just casual, right? We're not...

9
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:26,918
- I saved your live, bitch.
- Casual that.

10
00:00:26,928 --> 00:00:28,789
A talking Lizard of the Dunes.

11
00:00:28,799 --> 00:00:32,097
Well, what's my birthright,
you scaly shit?

12
00:00:32,107 --> 00:00:35,187
It's the talking animals.
They've all been struck dumb.

13
00:00:35,197 --> 00:00:37,494
All those organs...
they're building blocks,

14
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:39,539
trying to piece together a body.

15
00:00:39,549 --> 00:00:42,499
Is it yours?

16
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:45,153
Eliot's alive. He's alive.

17
00:00:45,163 --> 00:00:48,026
- So you're Team Monster now?
- I'm Team Eliot.

18
00:00:48,036 --> 00:00:52,552
Your Penny's dead or not
alive in some confusing way?

19
00:00:52,562 --> 00:00:54,815
- You're Kady?
- What's going on?

20
00:00:54,825 --> 00:00:56,513
I'm not your Penny.

21
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:58,515
Marina.

22
00:00:58,525 --> 00:00:59,951
I've been looking for you.

23
00:00:59,961 --> 00:01:02,954
- Penny, right?
- I know you?

24
00:01:20,895 --> 00:01:23,201
Well, it's about time you woke up.

25
00:01:24,202 --> 00:01:25,542
What the hell?

26
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:27,282
I assume you remember getting jumped.

27
00:01:27,292 --> 00:01:30,677
Well, what happened
next is you were sold

28
00:01:30,687 --> 00:01:33,027
for 500 bucks
and an Alpha Black Lotus...

29
00:01:33,037 --> 00:01:35,203
mint condish.

30
00:01:35,213 --> 00:01:36,944
It's Magic the Gathering?

31
00:01:36,954 --> 00:01:39,599
Are you telling me that
Magic cards are actually magic?

32
00:01:39,609 --> 00:01:43,124
No, just really expensive.

33
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:48,662
Excuse me.

34
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,872
Okay, you know this kid?

35
00:01:51,882 --> 00:01:55,180
Not personally.
He's kind of a legend, though.

36
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,747
He's a horomancer.

37
00:01:56,757 --> 00:01:58,618
You know, time magic,
fourth dimension shit.

38
00:01:58,628 --> 00:02:00,968
Yeah, cool story. Why am I in a cage?

39
00:02:00,978 --> 00:02:03,231
Hey, Stoppard.

40
00:02:03,241 --> 00:02:04,450
What is it you want?

41
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,974
You want a spell? Deweys?

42
00:02:06,984 --> 00:02:09,934
- Lose your virginity?
- You're not really my type.

43
00:02:09,944 --> 00:02:12,066
Well, if he is,
you can totally have him.

44
00:02:12,076 --> 00:02:16,593
That's... No, I-I don't want
sex or to hurt you.

45
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:18,072
I don't want any of that.

46
00:02:18,082 --> 00:02:20,422
I just want you guys
to go back to your timeline

47
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,260
where you belong.

48
00:02:24,567 --> 00:02:26,864
Look, it's nothing personal.

49
00:02:26,874 --> 00:02:31,303
People in cages is
never not personal, sweetie.

50
00:02:31,313 --> 00:02:35,263
You guys are creating
a frequency dissonance.

51
00:02:35,273 --> 00:02:37,911
It's your quarks... subtle.

52
00:02:37,922 --> 00:02:39,703
Most people wouldn't notice,
but what I do...

53
00:02:39,713 --> 00:02:43,010
- What are you doing?
- You guys are fucking up every spell.

54
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,186
Here's an idea... adjust to our quarks.

55
00:02:45,196 --> 00:02:46,971
They're subatomic. How hard can it be?

56
00:02:46,981 --> 00:02:49,626
Yeah, I tried that. Didn't work.

57
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:51,366
So...

58
00:02:51,376 --> 00:02:54,761
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no, no, no.

59
00:02:57,252 --> 00:03:00,158
- Welcome home, guys.
- Father fuck me.

60
00:03:03,824 --> 00:03:05,816
That's weird.

61
00:03:05,826 --> 00:03:09,471
It was just working a minute ago.

62
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,702
Yeah, it's 'cause there
was magic in that timeline.

63
00:03:11,713 --> 00:03:13,668
There ain't in timeline 23.

64
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:21,189
You gonna let me out?

65
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,965
Why would I? You're a psychopath.

66
00:03:24,975 --> 00:03:26,663
One, rude.

67
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,795
And, two, I know how to use
that thing, and you don't.

68
00:03:28,805 --> 00:03:30,841
You're also a compulsive liar, so...

69
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:32,973
Okay, well, you're going
to send yourself

70
00:03:32,983 --> 00:03:36,726
to some cracked-out
in-between space, but whatever.

71
00:03:48,303 --> 00:03:49,957
Don't screw this up.

72
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:55,692
Calm your man tits. I got this.

73
00:04:03,361 --> 00:04:05,527
Okay...

74
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:10,707
I thought you said you
knew how to use this thing.

75
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:13,177
Well, you should learn to trust
your instincts about people.

76
00:04:13,188 --> 00:04:15,606
Relax... there's enough juice
in the Dewey for one more jump.

77
00:04:15,617 --> 00:04:17,714
Let's just not use it
until we know how to, okay?

78
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,585
Sure, sure, cool, cool.

79
00:04:19,596 --> 00:04:23,948
The vibe I'm getting from
this timeline is very "1984."

80
00:04:24,991 --> 00:04:28,513
Worse. It's "The Crucible."

81
00:04:35,188 --> 00:04:39,019
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -

82
00:04:40,877 --> 00:04:42,390
I don't know, Q.

83
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,523
If we help him collect
his stone organ prizes,

84
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:47,482
we can get him out of Eliot.
It's a good plan.

85
00:04:47,492 --> 00:04:49,267
Unless we help him build

86
00:04:49,277 --> 00:04:51,661
a completely indestructible
titan god body.

87
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:53,358
Well, he's already pretty murder-y.

88
00:04:53,368 --> 00:04:54,751
It can't get much worse.

89
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:57,536
You say that like we
can just risk people's lives.

90
00:04:57,546 --> 00:04:59,190
We've taken down gods before.

91
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,366
And we end up losing every time.

92
00:05:01,376 --> 00:05:02,454
It's Eliot.

93
00:05:02,464 --> 00:05:05,762
Right now we can't fix everything,

94
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:08,242
but I think that we can do this.

95
00:05:08,252 --> 00:05:10,941
Okay, for now, we help the
monster, but at the same time,

96
00:05:10,951 --> 00:05:14,031
we also figure out what our
next move's going to be.

97
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,816
Thank you.

98
00:05:16,826 --> 00:05:19,123
I don't know. I guess I'm just worried.

99
00:05:19,133 --> 00:05:21,200
- I can't help you if you...
- You're helping a lot.

100
00:05:21,211 --> 00:05:22,909
I was a goddess, and now I'm just

101
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:25,346
your friendly neighborhood
bulletproof vest.

102
00:05:25,356 --> 00:05:27,784
I mean, you would be
a very high level X-Men.

103
00:05:29,056 --> 00:05:30,787
Like Emma Frost's diamond form.

104
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:32,266
- Mutant?
- A mutant.

105
00:05:32,276 --> 00:05:36,270
Like The Indestructress.

106
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,794
The page you gave the monster...

107
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,056
you remember what it says?

108
00:05:39,066 --> 00:05:40,753
We didn't have time to decipher it all.

109
00:05:40,763 --> 00:05:42,385
I mean, there were a lot of hieroglyphs.

110
00:05:42,396 --> 00:05:44,931
Okay, do you remember what hieroglyphs?

111
00:05:44,941 --> 00:05:47,107
So I'm thinking... like, so...

112
00:05:47,117 --> 00:05:51,677
we've got two stone things
covered in hieroglyphs,

113
00:05:51,687 --> 00:05:54,332
neither of which came
from an Egyptian god, so...

114
00:05:54,342 --> 00:05:56,551
- Who did the raiding?
- And why?

115
00:05:56,561 --> 00:05:59,816
There were a lot of...

116
00:05:59,826 --> 00:06:01,948
these ones.

117
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,558
- What is that?
- A lot.

118
00:06:03,568 --> 00:06:05,082
A yellow fruit?

119
00:06:05,092 --> 00:06:08,476
- Is there a yellow fruit god?
- I don't know.

120
00:06:08,486 --> 00:06:12,045
I don't remember anything
from any class at Brakebills.

121
00:06:12,055 --> 00:06:14,831
Recently uncovered tomb changes much

122
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:18,051
of what archeologists thought
they knew about Ancient Egypt.

123
00:06:18,061 --> 00:06:20,924
Maybe stuff Brakebills
didn't know about.

124
00:06:20,934 --> 00:06:22,413
Worth a shot.

125
00:06:33,163 --> 00:06:34,938
Why Modesto, Alice?

126
00:06:34,948 --> 00:06:36,853
Still trying to figure that out.

127
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,680
My life, that is.

128
00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:45,426
- I like your bunnies.
- They were my mom's.

129
00:06:45,436 --> 00:06:49,213
Well, she had lovely taste
in glass animals.

130
00:06:49,223 --> 00:06:51,476
No drugs, no booze, no bullshit.

131
00:06:51,486 --> 00:06:53,521
You want to smoke, you do it outside,

132
00:06:53,531 --> 00:06:55,697
and the rent is due on the 5th.

133
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:58,048
- I understand.
- Okay.

134
00:06:58,058 --> 00:07:00,495
I'll show you to your room.

135
00:07:01,975 --> 00:07:04,794
Just one more question...

136
00:07:04,804 --> 00:07:07,709
what is there to do in, Modesto?

137
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:12,333
Shit-all, really.

138
00:07:15,205 --> 00:07:17,981
So then why is it here
if it's native to Loria?

139
00:07:17,991 --> 00:07:20,548
We're unsure, but since
the return of magic,

140
00:07:20,558 --> 00:07:22,594
the Atros flower has been found blooming

141
00:07:22,604 --> 00:07:24,117
all over Fillory.

142
00:07:24,127 --> 00:07:26,380
Its pollen is why the
talking animals can't speak.

143
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,121
Allergies are why my birthright lizard

144
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:29,731
ain't saying shit?

145
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,168
Wait, if the bunnies can't talk,

146
00:07:31,178 --> 00:07:32,734
that means that we're cut off

147
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,301
from everyone else back on Earth.

148
00:07:34,311 --> 00:07:36,639
How am I going to remind them
to water my rosemary plants?

149
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:39,176
Or ask 23 to blip our asses back.

150
00:07:39,186 --> 00:07:41,395
- That too.
- There is good news.

151
00:07:41,405 --> 00:07:44,224
- We found a remedy.
- The juice from a beet

152
00:07:44,234 --> 00:07:46,574
that grows on one of
the smaller fingerling isles...

153
00:07:46,584 --> 00:07:48,098
Codswall...

154
00:07:48,108 --> 00:07:50,927
best known for their
inordinately polite alpacas.

155
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:53,930
- Alpacas can be supreme dicks.
- Great.

156
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,063
Get a ship to Cockswallow.

157
00:07:57,073 --> 00:07:58,673
Codswall.

158
00:07:58,683 --> 00:08:01,589
Juice the beets, distribute, done.

159
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,679
There's one small, minute, trivial,

160
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:08,466
infinitesimally miniscule,
itty-bitty problem.

161
00:08:08,476 --> 00:08:12,654
Lady Pike, who rules Codswall,
has been known to be...

162
00:08:14,525 --> 00:08:15,777
Difficult.

163
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:19,129
Are you saying she's a bitch?

164
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:21,435
Good thing I'm not one at all, then.

165
00:08:21,445 --> 00:08:24,351
Stop laughing.

166
00:08:32,108 --> 00:08:34,579
That it?

167
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:36,450
Do you have any suggestions
on things to do

168
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,278
in or around Modesto?

169
00:08:38,288 --> 00:08:40,628
Die of boredom?

170
00:08:42,858 --> 00:08:46,721
I like your tattoos.

171
00:08:46,731 --> 00:08:49,463
Hard getting by
with all those shortages?

172
00:08:49,473 --> 00:08:53,467
Yeah, maybe for the classically trained.

173
00:08:53,477 --> 00:08:56,731
Cockroaches like me,
we do what we got to.

174
00:08:56,741 --> 00:08:58,646
Always have.

175
00:09:00,397 --> 00:09:02,346
- Get over there!
- I didn't do anything.

176
00:09:02,356 --> 00:09:04,310
They're just tattoos.
They don't mean anything.

177
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:07,307
Keep moving. They are not
fucking around here.

178
00:09:07,317 --> 00:09:09,005
Yeah, honestly, I'm more concerned

179
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:11,268
about what my girlfriend
will do if I don't make it back

180
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:12,660
in time for her birthday.

181
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,314
You have a girlfriend?

182
00:09:14,324 --> 00:09:16,360
As in a human you give a shit about?

183
00:09:16,371 --> 00:09:18,928
Yeah, and I'd rather not
lose her this time.

184
00:09:18,938 --> 00:09:20,625
We were a thing back in timeline 23,

185
00:09:20,635 --> 00:09:21,713
and I fucked it up.

186
00:09:21,723 --> 00:09:23,323
You're telling me that you found

187
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:25,021
another one of her in timeline 40?

188
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:27,980
Yes. And now that I know what
she will and won't put up with,

189
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,634
it's going so much better this time.

190
00:09:29,644 --> 00:09:32,376
- That's sociopathic.
- Dude, we're refugees.

191
00:09:32,386 --> 00:09:34,465
We deserve any and all
advantages that come our way.

192
00:09:34,475 --> 00:09:36,293
Yeah, like penthouse apartments?

193
00:09:36,303 --> 00:09:38,512
'Cause I don't know any
refugees that live like that.

194
00:09:38,522 --> 00:09:40,036
You want that thing? You can have it.

195
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,733
It's way more trouble than it's worth.

196
00:09:41,743 --> 00:09:44,040
Hey, crazy pitch...

197
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,347
what if we asked Stoppard
for help... here?

198
00:09:47,357 --> 00:09:49,306
Like the Stoppard in this timeline?

199
00:09:49,316 --> 00:09:50,785
Probably got burned at the stake.

200
00:09:50,795 --> 00:09:52,657
Okay, but if he didn't,
he has no beef with us.

201
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:56,356
We take the thing to him.
If anyone can fix it, he can.

202
00:09:56,366 --> 00:09:58,315
There's so much terrible
about that idea.

203
00:09:58,325 --> 00:10:01,927
Okay, do you know
another horomancer? No?

204
00:10:01,937 --> 00:10:03,678
Then let's go.

205
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:21,200
Brothers and sisters,
when things are lost,

206
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:24,246
they want to be found...

207
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:26,771
Ms. Ross's engagement ring,

208
00:10:26,781 --> 00:10:29,871
little Joey Mireles' dog...

209
00:10:31,481 --> 00:10:33,255
That we will find the money

210
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:36,128
to pay for Kiersten Bron's
leukemia treatment.

211
00:10:36,138 --> 00:10:38,870
- Tea?
- No, thank you.

212
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,612
Do you know Reverend Ted Grayson?

213
00:10:42,622 --> 00:10:45,093
Yeah, he's my minister.

214
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:48,053
He's a little theatrical
at times, but he's a good man.

215
00:10:48,063 --> 00:10:52,448
- Why, are you religious?
- Not really. You?

216
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:53,972
No.

217
00:10:53,982 --> 00:10:55,669
My mom was.

218
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:58,193
I was on probation when she passed,

219
00:10:58,203 --> 00:11:02,850
and the congregation was there
for me, so I still go.

220
00:12:27,858 --> 00:12:30,068
Look, I'm not good at
the whole back-and-forth thing,

221
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:31,330
so I'm just going to say it.

222
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,549
I saw you. I saw you find the lock box.

223
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:34,811
You followed me?

224
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:36,117
How did you know where to dig?

225
00:12:36,127 --> 00:12:38,695
No idea what you're talking about.

226
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,693
How the hell did you just do that?

227
00:12:46,703 --> 00:12:48,710
Same way you found the box.

228
00:12:49,793 --> 00:12:53,057
I'm a magician. Like you.

229
00:12:55,103 --> 00:12:57,356
You had no idea, did you?

230
00:12:57,366 --> 00:13:00,195
That it was real till you could do it.

231
00:13:01,457 --> 00:13:05,156
You can talk to me. To me, this
doesn't even count as weird.

232
00:13:08,072 --> 00:13:10,935
It just started a couple of months ago.

233
00:13:10,945 --> 00:13:14,851
I, I lost my keys,
and then all of a sudden,

234
00:13:14,861 --> 00:13:18,290
I could just feel it in my head.

235
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,035
You're a quaeromancer.

236
00:13:21,042 --> 00:13:24,078
It's really rare actually.
I-I've never met one...

237
00:13:24,088 --> 00:13:26,820
and I went to a school
full of people like us.

238
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:29,342
- Are you shitting me?
- Nope.

239
00:13:29,353 --> 00:13:31,781
They can do all kinds of things.

240
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:34,045
Most people don't figure out
their thing until their 20s,

241
00:13:34,055 --> 00:13:37,001
but every now and then,
somebody... it takes them longer.

242
00:13:37,012 --> 00:13:38,351
Have you told anyone?

243
00:13:38,362 --> 00:13:41,498
They would think I was nuts.

244
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,108
Honestly...

245
00:13:45,805 --> 00:13:48,035
It's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

246
00:13:48,289 --> 00:13:49,820
Do you know what I mean?

247
00:13:49,831 --> 00:13:51,788
Well...

248
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:53,757
yes and no.

249
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,765
Sheila, I think you
might be why I'm here.

250
00:14:01,313 --> 00:14:04,336
- Librarians.
- Librarians?

251
00:14:04,346 --> 00:14:07,044
They can't know I'm here.
Please don't tell them.

252
00:14:12,286 --> 00:14:14,520
Thanks, but I'm not interested.

253
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:15,560
Sheila Cozener?

254
00:14:15,571 --> 00:14:17,088
I'm Paul, this is Laurel,

255
00:14:17,098 --> 00:14:19,384
and we'd like to talk to you
about an opportunity.

256
00:14:19,395 --> 00:14:22,437
One involving your newfound talents.

257
00:14:27,535 --> 00:14:30,536
Sheila, I am telling you,
you can't trust the Library.

258
00:14:30,546 --> 00:14:33,147
Okay, I-I know that they told
you they'd give you more magic

259
00:14:33,157 --> 00:14:36,063
if you signed up for a Library
card, but they won't, okay?

260
00:14:36,073 --> 00:14:38,457
The Library card is just a way
for them to keep tabs on you.

261
00:14:38,467 --> 00:14:40,154
Alice, I get it.

262
00:14:40,164 --> 00:14:42,548
You know, whatever run-in
you had with them

263
00:14:42,558 --> 00:14:44,158
clearly traumatized you.

264
00:14:44,168 --> 00:14:45,899
I don't know enough about any of this

265
00:14:45,909 --> 00:14:47,379
to be signing up for anything.

266
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:51,861
You said that you were
in Modesto because of me.

267
00:14:51,871 --> 00:14:53,385
Right?

268
00:14:53,395 --> 00:14:54,777
What if it's because

269
00:14:54,787 --> 00:14:56,779
you're supposed to teach me everything?

270
00:14:56,789 --> 00:14:59,739
No. Knowing more isn't better.

271
00:14:59,749 --> 00:15:00,884
How could it not?

272
00:15:00,895 --> 00:15:04,657
Because it's powerful and it
can be really, really bad.

273
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:06,485
Okay, look, I'm a grown woman,

274
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,578
you're a grown woman, we make choices.

275
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:10,531
Is there something I'm missing here?

276
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,143
Okay, listen...

277
00:15:12,153 --> 00:15:15,798
I did a lot of stupid shit
when I was your age.

278
00:15:15,808 --> 00:15:18,845
Yeah, so did I, and magic
made it so much bigger

279
00:15:18,855 --> 00:15:20,412
and so much worse.

280
00:15:20,422 --> 00:15:23,676
And if you regret it,
if you think about those people

281
00:15:23,686 --> 00:15:26,200
that you hurt and all
that time that you wasted

282
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:28,594
every single day,
then I know how you feel.

283
00:15:28,604 --> 00:15:30,944
Look, I hear you. I get it.

284
00:15:30,954 --> 00:15:33,503
But it's what we make of it, right?

285
00:15:33,522 --> 00:15:36,127
And for me, it's...

286
00:15:37,176 --> 00:15:38,951
it's like the first time that I can,

287
00:15:38,961 --> 00:15:40,430
you know, turn things around,

288
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,130
maybe... maybe do something good.

289
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:48,743
But I need you to help me do that.

290
00:15:48,761 --> 00:15:50,415
Please!

291
00:15:53,062 --> 00:15:54,749
All right...

292
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:57,970
we are going to need
to take this outside.

293
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,537
If you own the house,
why do you smoke outside?

294
00:16:00,547 --> 00:16:04,411
I don't know... it's
my mother's rules, I guess.

295
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,805
Always seemed kind of wrong
just breaking them

296
00:16:06,815 --> 00:16:08,642
'cause she was gone.

297
00:16:12,211 --> 00:16:13,952
Come on.

298
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:17,303
Okay.

299
00:16:18,565 --> 00:16:21,210
Let's start with Popper 1.

300
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,777
Okay.

301
00:16:22,787 --> 00:16:25,606
I'll make this simple.
We need your beets.

302
00:16:25,616 --> 00:16:29,175
At a fair price, of course. I
doubt the island of Clitswell...

303
00:16:29,185 --> 00:16:31,917
- Codswall.
- Codswall.

304
00:16:31,927 --> 00:16:33,353
Anyway, I...

305
00:16:33,363 --> 00:16:35,268
Do you even know where Codswall is?

306
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:37,618
Of course.

307
00:16:37,628 --> 00:16:40,273
It's one of the bigger...

308
00:16:40,283 --> 00:16:42,449
smaller fingering islands.

309
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:45,278
- Fingerling.
- Exactly. Fingerling.

310
00:16:45,288 --> 00:16:47,759
Thank you, Your Majesty.

311
00:16:47,769 --> 00:16:49,804
- For?
- Confirming my suspicion

312
00:16:49,814 --> 00:16:52,111
that you've never had
consideration for us.

313
00:16:52,121 --> 00:16:53,939
This makes my decision to sell our beets

314
00:16:53,949 --> 00:16:57,856
to West Loria that much easier.

315
00:16:57,866 --> 00:17:01,729
- Where the fuck is West Loria?
- West of Loria, Your Majesty.

316
00:17:01,739 --> 00:17:03,687
- But since when?
- While you were Janet,

317
00:17:03,697 --> 00:17:08,311
King Idri and his sister, Ru,
had a squabble/slight war.

318
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:12,000
- Like a civil war?
- And as acting High King,

319
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:14,829
I asked myself, "What would
Margo or Eliot do?"

320
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:18,311
- Support our ally, Idri.
- Unfortunately, he lost.

321
00:17:18,321 --> 00:17:22,402
Now Queen Ru rules over West Loria.

322
00:17:22,412 --> 00:17:24,317
And 'cause she's pissed we helped Idri,

323
00:17:24,327 --> 00:17:26,710
she wants all Lady Pike's fresh beets?

324
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,147
Damn. That's cold.

325
00:17:28,157 --> 00:17:29,844
Verily, they don't even have

326
00:17:29,854 --> 00:17:33,369
- talking animals in West Loria.
- On problem at a time.

327
00:17:33,379 --> 00:17:36,111
- The Cumdumpsterson twat...
- Codswall.

328
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:37,547
I know what I said.

329
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,114
I'm going to firebomb the shit

330
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:41,334
out of her floating patch
of dirt and take her beets.

331
00:17:41,344 --> 00:17:42,988
Bada bing, bada fuck her.

332
00:17:42,998 --> 00:17:46,208
Could we be a tad less incendiary?

333
00:17:46,218 --> 00:17:47,862
Agreed.

334
00:17:47,872 --> 00:17:50,701
What would Eliot do?

335
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,956
Eliot's not here, sweetie.

336
00:17:54,966 --> 00:17:56,881
I am.

337
00:18:01,103 --> 00:18:04,661
So... just to ask this,

338
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:07,926
can we really risk war with West Loria?

339
00:18:07,936 --> 00:18:10,493
Diplomacy was Eliot's thing, Josh.

340
00:18:10,503 --> 00:18:12,017
Diplomacy is what got you elected.

341
00:18:12,027 --> 00:18:15,020
I got elected because
I listened to a drunk bear

342
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:16,630
talk about his fee-fees.

343
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,373
- That's all diplomacy is!
- It was an accident.

344
00:18:20,383 --> 00:18:21,809
I don't know how

345
00:18:21,819 --> 00:18:24,594
to intentionally care
about other people's shit.

346
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:27,694
Lucky for you, that's all I do.

347
00:18:30,959 --> 00:18:32,385
Fine.

348
00:18:32,395 --> 00:18:34,604
One shot, Hoberman.

349
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:47,627
Hi, we're looking for Stoppard.

350
00:18:49,934 --> 00:18:51,936
Daniel, honey.

351
00:18:53,938 --> 00:18:56,148
Come in before someone sees you.

352
00:18:56,158 --> 00:18:59,455
Amazing. I haven't seen
anything like this

353
00:18:59,465 --> 00:19:03,024
since before the exclusion laws.

354
00:19:03,034 --> 00:19:04,243
I have one of these!

355
00:19:04,253 --> 00:19:06,245
And it's missing a spoke like mine.

356
00:19:06,255 --> 00:19:08,029
What are the odds?

357
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:10,684
Anyway, this... this one,
it didn't come with a manual.

358
00:19:10,694 --> 00:19:12,599
Do you have any ideas?

359
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,470
Well, it's hard to explain,
but I think...

360
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,777
Daniel, something's not...

361
00:19:16,787 --> 00:19:19,703
Mom? Mom, what's wrong?

362
00:19:20,704 --> 00:19:22,652
Something... something's wrong
with the spells.

363
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,611
Hold on, I'll figure this out.

364
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,623
Quickly, while he's busy.

365
00:19:34,182 --> 00:19:36,483
Found an outdated copy

366
00:19:36,494 --> 00:19:39,183
of Taussig's Primer and a VCR manual.

367
00:19:39,193 --> 00:19:42,490
This place has shit for helpful books.

368
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,710
Well, at least it's standing.

369
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,886
I cannot believe a bunch
of militant muggles

370
00:19:46,896 --> 00:19:49,019
beat me to burning down Brakebills.

371
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:52,413
- What's that?
- It was Sonia's.

372
00:19:52,423 --> 00:19:56,026
- You mean Stoppard's mother?
- I mean Sonia Kikuno...

373
00:19:56,036 --> 00:19:59,420
the genius who basically
pioneered horomancy.

374
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:02,597
This is easily one of the most
accidentally valuable things

375
00:20:02,607 --> 00:20:04,942
I've ever stolen. Here, look.

376
00:20:05,689 --> 00:20:07,544
Wasn't that in Stoppard's workshop?

377
00:20:07,555 --> 00:20:11,244
Yeah. That screen
opens a window in time.

378
00:20:11,254 --> 00:20:14,073
You can FaceTime with the past
as far back as 50 years.

379
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,336
It's genuinely genius. Like, wow.

380
00:20:16,346 --> 00:20:18,405
A lot of these spells use cinnabar.

381
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,427
Hasn't... hasn't that stuff
been banned for years?

382
00:20:20,437 --> 00:20:23,953
Yeah, it causes severe
neuro-degeneration,

383
00:20:23,963 --> 00:20:26,042
which is probably what's
happening with Sonia.

384
00:20:26,052 --> 00:20:27,957
She's been hitting the cinnabar

385
00:20:27,967 --> 00:20:30,437
pretty hard for decades, I imagine.

386
00:20:30,447 --> 00:20:32,439
So...

387
00:20:32,449 --> 00:20:35,312
she has clockwork Alzheimer's?

388
00:20:35,322 --> 00:20:38,706
Kind of, but so much worse.

389
00:20:38,716 --> 00:20:40,447
Your brain gets unstuck in time.

390
00:20:40,457 --> 00:20:42,797
You don't know where you are
or when you are,

391
00:20:42,807 --> 00:20:44,451
and you can't control it.

392
00:20:44,461 --> 00:20:48,107
It is good, good times,
and then you die.

393
00:20:48,117 --> 00:20:50,849
Yeah, but... but it seemed
like they had a-a treatment.

394
00:20:50,859 --> 00:20:53,460
I mean, those weird watches she had on?

395
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,637
Yeah, until they got messed up...

396
00:20:56,647 --> 00:20:58,161
by us.

397
00:20:58,171 --> 00:21:00,293
Must be what started all this.

398
00:21:00,303 --> 00:21:02,382
I mean, back in timeline 40...

399
00:21:02,392 --> 00:21:04,689
it's why Stoppard hunted us down.

400
00:21:04,699 --> 00:21:06,038
He's trying to save his mom.

401
00:21:06,048 --> 00:21:08,736
Now I almost feel bad for him.

402
00:21:08,746 --> 00:21:09,999
Feel bad for us.

403
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:11,783
Even if we get back to timeline 40,

404
00:21:11,793 --> 00:21:14,655
Stoppard is going to do
anything he can to kick us out.

405
00:21:14,665 --> 00:21:16,222
Unless we kill him.

406
00:21:16,232 --> 00:21:19,051
For... trying to save his mom?

407
00:21:19,061 --> 00:21:21,706
Moms die every day. Circle of life.

408
00:21:21,716 --> 00:21:23,142
Wow!

409
00:21:23,152 --> 00:21:25,014
No!

410
00:21:25,024 --> 00:21:27,973
We help him save her.

411
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:41,769
Am I just absorbing

412
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:43,510
a fuck-ton of cinnabar right now?

413
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,219
Yeah, and breathing it.

414
00:21:47,698 --> 00:21:49,168
Great.

415
00:21:49,178 --> 00:21:52,486
Let's finish this
and get the hell out of here.

416
00:22:04,237 --> 00:22:07,056
- Sonia?
- Who are you?

417
00:22:07,066 --> 00:22:09,188
Friend's of Daniel, who's grown now.

418
00:22:09,198 --> 00:22:10,755
Listen, we need to talk to you

419
00:22:10,765 --> 00:22:12,975
about that cinnabar
that you're using. It's...

420
00:22:12,985 --> 00:22:16,674
Frying my brain
into cheesecloth, I know.

421
00:22:16,684 --> 00:22:20,547
Daniel used my designs to build
the device you're using.

422
00:22:20,557 --> 00:22:22,941
We talked a couple months ago.

423
00:22:22,951 --> 00:22:25,988
If you were his friends,
you'd know that.

424
00:22:25,998 --> 00:22:27,859
He asked you to stop?

425
00:22:27,869 --> 00:22:29,469
Of course.

426
00:22:29,479 --> 00:22:31,906
He also told me I'm about
to have a breakthrough

427
00:22:31,916 --> 00:22:33,865
that creates a whole new discipline.

428
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:36,737
I can't stop now.
My work's too important.

429
00:22:36,747 --> 00:22:38,217
Fair point.

430
00:22:38,227 --> 00:22:40,567
So you're just going to pick
your clock shit

431
00:22:40,577 --> 00:22:42,265
over your own kid?

432
00:22:42,275 --> 00:22:46,051
No, idiot. I choose both.

433
00:22:46,061 --> 00:22:48,532
I designed devices
to counter the cinnabar,

434
00:22:48,542 --> 00:22:52,492
tether my mind right here
with my work and my kid.

435
00:22:52,502 --> 00:22:56,366
As long as I have these
working for me, I'll be fine.

436
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:59,108
I intend to die a very old lady...

437
00:22:59,118 --> 00:23:01,294
sharp as a tack.

438
00:23:03,252 --> 00:23:05,114
Fuck her. It's not our fault.

439
00:23:05,124 --> 00:23:06,506
She knew the consequences,

440
00:23:06,516 --> 00:23:08,247
and she still licked her paintbrushes.

441
00:23:08,257 --> 00:23:10,597
We go back to 40, we're
taking the kid's mom away.

442
00:23:10,607 --> 00:23:12,314
- I'm not doing that.
- Well, I'm not losing

443
00:23:12,325 --> 00:23:14,253
my life because some
horo-bitch is a shitty mom.

444
00:23:14,263 --> 00:23:16,951
She's shitty so he should suffer?

445
00:23:16,961 --> 00:23:18,910
We're the ones who don't belong.

446
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,444
You know what? You do you.

447
00:23:24,143 --> 00:23:27,136
I'm going back to 40 and my future wife.

448
00:23:27,146 --> 00:23:30,139
Don't touch me!

449
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,754
Shit.

450
00:23:43,545 --> 00:23:45,842
Quick.

451
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:58,950
- Anything?
- Nothing yet.

452
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,127
Keep looking.

453
00:24:02,137 --> 00:24:04,052
Quentin.

454
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,262
Whoopsies.

455
00:24:09,336 --> 00:24:11,180
Are you drunk?

456
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:14,183
This body hearts tequila...

457
00:24:14,193 --> 00:24:15,836
when I'm happy, when I'm sad,

458
00:24:15,846 --> 00:24:18,970
when I'm bored because
everything is taking too long,

459
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,754
meaning you.

460
00:24:20,764 --> 00:24:25,107
Relevant story... I was in a
road, and I almost got hit by...

461
00:24:25,117 --> 00:24:27,674
what do you call it... a big fat truck.

462
00:24:27,684 --> 00:24:30,199
But I wouldn't have felt anything at all

463
00:24:30,209 --> 00:24:32,689
because tequila is my friend.

464
00:24:33,951 --> 00:24:36,335
You know, great news...

465
00:24:36,345 --> 00:24:39,904
we've made good progress
finding that part of yours.

466
00:24:39,914 --> 00:24:44,169
You wouldn't still happen
to have the paper I gave you?

467
00:24:44,179 --> 00:24:46,867
I...

468
00:24:46,877 --> 00:24:48,391
misplaced it.

469
00:24:48,401 --> 00:24:50,871
Do you know anything about...

470
00:24:50,881 --> 00:24:55,137
an Egyptian god of yellow fruit?

471
00:24:55,147 --> 00:24:57,704
I'm not at all helpful like this, am I?

472
00:24:57,714 --> 00:24:58,879
What do you think?

473
00:24:58,889 --> 00:25:00,446
You seem stressed

474
00:25:00,456 --> 00:25:03,188
by your vast and obvious limitations.

475
00:25:04,678 --> 00:25:07,236
Why don't we just
ask someone who was there?

476
00:25:22,198 --> 00:25:24,146
You know, for having
such desiccated hands,

477
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:27,149
his Hieratic script's amazing.

478
00:25:30,032 --> 00:25:31,937
What did he say?

479
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:35,897
Cut our poor mummy friend
some slack, Hoo-lia.

480
00:25:35,907 --> 00:25:37,420
He took a hook to the brain.

481
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:39,945
Of course he's got a bit
of a speech impediment.

482
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,903
The yellow fruit.

483
00:25:41,913 --> 00:25:46,473
It's a mandrake root,
and we are looking for Heka,

484
00:25:46,483 --> 00:25:48,693
the God of Magic and Medicine.

485
00:25:48,703 --> 00:25:51,260
It looks like he's got
one of your stones.

486
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:52,827
Let's go kill him.

487
00:25:52,837 --> 00:25:56,014
He's already dead.

488
00:25:57,494 --> 00:26:02,010
Looks like he was buried
in the Temple of...

489
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,056
Esna?

490
00:26:04,066 --> 00:26:09,365
Which was looted shortly after.

491
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:12,934
And where is it now? My loot?

492
00:26:14,424 --> 00:26:18,200
Yes, this is very disappointing.

493
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,376
Figure this out before I get mad.

494
00:26:20,386 --> 00:26:24,511
This body craves a cinnamon churro.

495
00:26:33,922 --> 00:26:36,088
Bye.

496
00:26:53,898 --> 00:26:56,238
- We can take a break.
- No, no, it's okay.

497
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:58,424
I want to keep going.

498
00:26:59,774 --> 00:27:01,940
It bothers you, doesn't it?
That I'm so into this?

499
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,898
It just worries me.

500
00:27:03,908 --> 00:27:07,597
For you, magic... you think
it just can fix everything,

501
00:27:07,607 --> 00:27:10,426
but it kind of has a way
of breaking things.

502
00:27:10,436 --> 00:27:12,428
Sometimes I feel like
everything that's gone wrong

503
00:27:12,438 --> 00:27:15,083
in my life is 'cause of it.

504
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:19,566
Yeah, I used to say the same
about alcohol, about drugs,

505
00:27:19,576 --> 00:27:22,874
about money, but none
of that's really good or bad.

506
00:27:22,884 --> 00:27:25,920
It just is.
It's how you handle it, really.

507
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:29,271
Don't drink that.
The tap's got lead in it.

508
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:31,621
You got to drink the bottled
water out of the fridge.

509
00:27:31,631 --> 00:27:34,799
- Why is there lead in the tap?
- City's pipes.

510
00:27:34,809 --> 00:27:37,105
They're old and corroded.

511
00:27:37,115 --> 00:27:38,803
Why don't they just fix it?

512
00:27:38,813 --> 00:27:42,773
That's cute that you think they would.

513
00:27:50,128 --> 00:27:52,251
Asekian's Purification.

514
00:27:52,261 --> 00:27:55,438
I can show you. It's simple.

515
00:27:57,483 --> 00:27:59,127
Can you do that

516
00:27:59,137 --> 00:28:01,434
for the rest of the water supply?

517
00:28:01,444 --> 00:28:04,437
No, or better yet, is there
a spell that would restore

518
00:28:04,447 --> 00:28:07,527
- all the old pipes in Modesto?
- There is, but...

519
00:28:07,537 --> 00:28:09,834
Okay, well, then do that.
Do it, please, because you have

520
00:28:09,844 --> 00:28:12,488
no idea how many people...
how many kids are...

521
00:28:12,498 --> 00:28:14,577
I... No, it's too big. We can't do it.

522
00:28:14,587 --> 00:28:17,493
There's not enough ambient magic.

523
00:28:17,503 --> 00:28:20,289
The Library... it doles out the rest?

524
00:28:22,857 --> 00:28:24,674
Wait.

525
00:28:24,684 --> 00:28:27,982
You said that they control the levels...

526
00:28:27,992 --> 00:28:32,987
of ambient magic that
flow through the pipes, right?

527
00:28:32,997 --> 00:28:34,293
Yeah?

528
00:28:34,303 --> 00:28:36,164
I can feel one.

529
00:28:36,174 --> 00:28:38,210
They're everywhere.

530
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,700
No, no, no, no, no.

531
00:28:42,441 --> 00:28:45,575
I think this one's different.

532
00:28:46,445 --> 00:28:48,230
This one has a leak.

533
00:28:50,493 --> 00:28:53,703
This isn't just food, Margo.

534
00:28:53,713 --> 00:28:55,705
This is your secret weapon.

535
00:28:55,715 --> 00:28:59,884
You can tell a lot about
people based on what they eat.

536
00:28:59,894 --> 00:29:03,583
- Everything looks lovely.
- Thank you.

537
00:29:03,593 --> 00:29:06,281
- Our chef is very...
- Talented.

538
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:07,717
Extra.

539
00:29:07,727 --> 00:29:09,545
I'll take that as a compliment.

540
00:29:09,555 --> 00:29:12,940
Like I was saying,
is she reserved, adventurous?

541
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,464
Maybe she's sexy and decadent

542
00:29:15,474 --> 00:29:18,816
like a truffle lobster mac and cheese.

543
00:29:18,826 --> 00:29:21,209
Interesting.

544
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:23,081
Mongoose cream egg with caviar.

545
00:29:23,091 --> 00:29:24,778
She's bold.

546
00:29:24,788 --> 00:29:27,999
Proud of her accomplishments,
but being so driven

547
00:29:28,009 --> 00:29:31,437
has led her to be lonely, misunderstood.

548
00:29:31,447 --> 00:29:33,308
Tick said something

549
00:29:33,318 --> 00:29:35,441
about Codswall's polite alpacas.

550
00:29:35,451 --> 00:29:37,443
Maybe she's proud of that. Ask.

551
00:29:37,453 --> 00:29:42,578
I hear Codswall has upstanding alpacas.

552
00:29:42,588 --> 00:29:46,365
It is a misconception that
alpacas have behavioral issues.

553
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:48,280
The truth is, they have a lack

554
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:50,195
of self-esteem from years of shearing.

555
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:53,763
Imagine being stripped naked
twice, even three times a year.

556
00:29:53,773 --> 00:29:56,723
There it is. She's real into her 'pacas.

557
00:29:56,733 --> 00:30:00,509
- Empathize with her.
- The indignity is real.

558
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:04,339
Like humans, alpacas need affection...

559
00:30:04,349 --> 00:30:06,428
- and love.
- Preach.

560
00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:07,777
You may not know this,

561
00:30:07,787 --> 00:30:11,085
but I ran on a platform
of animal equality.

562
00:30:11,095 --> 00:30:12,957
My administration is the first

563
00:30:12,967 --> 00:30:16,395
to give talking animals
their rightful voice.

564
00:30:16,405 --> 00:30:19,267
I mean, that is why
we're here tonight, right?

565
00:30:19,277 --> 00:30:21,008
The animals.

566
00:30:21,018 --> 00:30:24,577
I just care so damn much.

567
00:30:24,587 --> 00:30:27,623
I like to drink my tea with...

568
00:30:27,633 --> 00:30:30,288
a splash of alpaca milk.

569
00:30:36,077 --> 00:30:37,372
Would you like some?

570
00:30:37,382 --> 00:30:39,635
You can't refuse this, Margo.

571
00:30:39,645 --> 00:30:43,693
It's straight from
my dearest Delilah's teat.

572
00:30:55,357 --> 00:30:57,011
Do it, Margo.

573
00:31:00,318 --> 00:31:01,972
Now!

574
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:04,932
Yeah, good.

575
00:31:06,324 --> 00:31:09,491
You are a champion.

576
00:31:09,501 --> 00:31:12,668
You can really taste the love.

577
00:31:12,678 --> 00:31:15,889
What a beautiful way to say it.

578
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:20,154
I'm afraid I may have judged
Your Majesty too quickly.

579
00:31:20,164 --> 00:31:22,026
Same...

580
00:31:22,036 --> 00:31:23,853
which is why I would love it

581
00:31:23,863 --> 00:31:26,987
if we could start fresh. Your beets...

582
00:31:26,997 --> 00:31:29,511
Unfortunately, I have
already agreed to sell my beets

583
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:30,686
to West Loria,

584
00:31:30,696 --> 00:31:32,906
and being a woman of my word,

585
00:31:32,916 --> 00:31:34,473
I can't go back.

586
00:31:34,483 --> 00:31:36,702
You understand, right?

587
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,262
I'm going to check on dessert.

588
00:31:41,272 --> 00:31:42,872
I'm about to skin a bitch.

589
00:31:42,882 --> 00:31:45,353
I want you to double down
on the charm offense.

590
00:31:45,363 --> 00:31:46,702
You got her eating

591
00:31:46,712 --> 00:31:48,878
out of your extra-diplomatic
hands right now.

592
00:31:48,888 --> 00:31:51,794
I guess I could lube her up
some more about her alpacas.

593
00:31:51,804 --> 00:31:55,494
Yes, exactly... you,
High King Margo Fucking Hanson,

594
00:31:55,504 --> 00:31:57,061
you got this.

595
00:31:57,071 --> 00:31:58,888
I know you didn't think
you could do this,

596
00:31:58,898 --> 00:32:01,891
but, honestly, I think
you're out-Elioting Eliot.

597
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:05,417
Strawberry ricotta soufflé is done.

598
00:32:05,427 --> 00:32:09,431
I'm gonna get that. You get back
to winning at High King-in'.

599
00:32:14,218 --> 00:32:16,776
- Margo, what are you doing?
- Being the real me.

600
00:32:16,786 --> 00:32:18,908
Let me tell you how this
is going to play out, lady.

601
00:32:18,918 --> 00:32:20,736
You're going to give me those beets,

602
00:32:20,746 --> 00:32:22,738
and I'm not going to skin and eat any

603
00:32:22,748 --> 00:32:26,438
of your tasty alpaca children, capisce?

604
00:32:26,448 --> 00:32:28,092
That's what I thought.

605
00:32:41,758 --> 00:32:43,968
What in the hell?

606
00:32:46,937 --> 00:32:48,364
Hi.

607
00:32:48,374 --> 00:32:50,409
I can't begin to imagine

608
00:32:50,419 --> 00:32:52,846
how you fucked yourself
hard enough to get here,

609
00:32:52,856 --> 00:32:55,022
but...

610
00:32:55,032 --> 00:32:57,208
Let's take advantage.

611
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:00,288
Interesting choice on the hair.

612
00:33:00,298 --> 00:33:03,509
Says the guy dressed
like an ambulance chaser.

613
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,034
- So you're dead me.
- Technically.

614
00:33:07,044 --> 00:33:08,514
Does this mean I'm dead, too?

615
00:33:08,524 --> 00:33:13,040
No, no, this is a-a,
kind of between space?

616
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:15,347
I saw you zapped yourself here
like an idiot,

617
00:33:15,357 --> 00:33:17,393
and I took a coffee break.

618
00:33:17,403 --> 00:33:19,699
I mean, I've been wanting
to talk to you.

619
00:33:19,709 --> 00:33:21,554
So then I assume you know
that I took your...

620
00:33:21,565 --> 00:33:24,530
You took my spot in my timeline? Yeah.

621
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,880
Didn't expect that twist
with Julia, though.

622
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:29,415
Yeah, I could say the same about Kady.

623
00:33:32,722 --> 00:33:35,715
For what it's worth, it never
felt right taking your place.

624
00:33:35,725 --> 00:33:37,500
- But, you know...
- Everything feels wrong,

625
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:40,241
so you just pick something?
Yeah, of course I do.

626
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:41,862
Real talk...

627
00:33:42,776 --> 00:33:44,507
You got to go back.

628
00:33:44,517 --> 00:33:46,204
To 23, I know, I'm working on it.

629
00:33:46,214 --> 00:33:48,511
No. My timeline.

630
00:33:48,521 --> 00:33:50,382
It's where you belong.

631
00:33:50,392 --> 00:33:52,036
Okay, do you want to cut the vague,

632
00:33:52,046 --> 00:33:54,473
omniscient Librarian shit
and just tell me why?

633
00:33:54,483 --> 00:33:57,128
It's complicated but crucial.

634
00:33:57,138 --> 00:33:58,869
You do know me existing there

635
00:33:58,879 --> 00:34:02,133
is making some very important
horomancer lady very sick?

636
00:34:02,143 --> 00:34:04,309
It's doing a lot more than that.

637
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:08,095
Look, I know you lost everyone
you love in timeline 23...

638
00:34:08,105 --> 00:34:09,532
Really?

639
00:34:09,542 --> 00:34:12,099
But they're still alive in timeline 40,

640
00:34:12,109 --> 00:34:14,537
and if I were you, which I am,

641
00:34:14,547 --> 00:34:17,191
I'd do whatever to not lose them again.

642
00:34:17,201 --> 00:34:20,281
Okay, you might be me,

643
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:23,197
but you don't know me, okay?

644
00:34:23,207 --> 00:34:24,677
Those shits are not my people.

645
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:28,115
Fair, but I know a little
about your future.

646
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:29,682
Perks of the gig.

647
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:32,119
So is being an abstruse dick
about it, apparently.

648
00:34:32,129 --> 00:34:33,947
Sonia can't be saved.

649
00:34:33,957 --> 00:34:37,473
Even if you go back to 23,
she's dead within a month.

650
00:34:37,483 --> 00:34:38,778
It's terminal. Period.

651
00:34:38,788 --> 00:34:41,781
Sounds like something I'd say to make
myself feel like less of an ass.

652
00:34:41,791 --> 00:34:43,914
Bigger things at play
than your guilt, buddy.

653
00:34:43,924 --> 00:34:47,178
You got to go back. Sorry.
That's as specific as I can be.

654
00:34:47,188 --> 00:34:49,093
Sorry? Are you?

655
00:34:49,103 --> 00:34:53,880
Dude, I just jumped you clear
over 1,000 miles of bullshit.

656
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:57,580
So I'm sorry if it feels bad
in your soft little heart,

657
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:01,453
but, more importantly, you're welcome.

658
00:35:01,463 --> 00:35:03,509
Kady wants you.

659
00:35:04,553 --> 00:35:06,729
They all want you.

660
00:35:08,209 --> 00:35:11,376
It's not my timeline anymore.

661
00:35:11,386 --> 00:35:13,639
It's yours.

662
00:35:13,649 --> 00:35:17,121
So, you remember...

663
00:35:17,131 --> 00:35:21,168
that when the moment comes,
I said, "Do it."

664
00:35:21,178 --> 00:35:22,822
Do what he says, okay?

665
00:35:22,832 --> 00:35:25,433
No, not okay. Vague as shit.

666
00:35:27,315 --> 00:35:29,437
To go back to 40, you're
gonna want to turn this dial

667
00:35:29,447 --> 00:35:32,092
three clicks to the right.

668
00:35:32,102 --> 00:35:35,008
Tell Kady I love her...

669
00:35:35,018 --> 00:35:37,020
and I'm sorry.

670
00:35:43,549 --> 00:35:44,931
Well, thank Christ.

671
00:35:44,941 --> 00:35:46,454
I thought you pissed off without me.

672
00:35:46,464 --> 00:35:49,675
- Where'd you go?
- It was...

673
00:35:49,685 --> 00:35:52,983
I honestly don't know how to explain it.

674
00:35:52,993 --> 00:35:56,474
But I know what we got to do now.

675
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,689
It's here.

676
00:36:09,749 --> 00:36:11,392
God.

677
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:14,265
You were right... there's a crack.

678
00:36:14,275 --> 00:36:17,268
I think it could split the pipe
open and let more ambient out.

679
00:36:17,278 --> 00:36:18,878
Here.

680
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,581
Once you pour it down the drain,
it should clean the water

681
00:37:03,592 --> 00:37:06,552
and clear the corrosion from the pipes.

682
00:37:16,781 --> 00:37:19,078
Did I do something wrong?

683
00:37:19,088 --> 00:37:21,124
No, I just... I can't remember

684
00:37:21,134 --> 00:37:25,128
the last time that magic
wasn't the problem.

685
00:37:25,138 --> 00:37:28,479
This calls for a drink.

686
00:37:35,496 --> 00:37:37,193
Thank you.

687
00:37:48,204 --> 00:37:50,283
Look, we'll find the stone. It'll be...

688
00:37:56,647 --> 00:37:59,128
What are you doing?

689
00:38:02,305 --> 00:38:04,384
Stop.

690
00:38:04,394 --> 00:38:06,048
Jesus.

691
00:38:12,663 --> 00:38:14,742
Those pills can kill you.

692
00:38:14,752 --> 00:38:16,744
I'll take a new body. I'm bored.

693
00:38:16,754 --> 00:38:18,746
You kill Eliot...

694
00:38:18,756 --> 00:38:21,281
and you can forget about us helping you.

695
00:38:23,413 --> 00:38:26,406
Eliot, Eliot, Eliot.

696
00:38:28,897 --> 00:38:31,368
Why do you care about him so much?

697
00:38:31,378 --> 00:38:33,718
Because I do.

698
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:37,417
You kill him, and we are done.

699
00:38:37,427 --> 00:38:39,506
I swear to God, I am serious.

700
00:38:39,516 --> 00:38:41,247
I will abandon you,

701
00:38:41,257 --> 00:38:44,381
and I will die trying
to burn you to the ground.

702
00:38:50,614 --> 00:38:53,694
That's cute.

703
00:38:53,704 --> 00:38:55,968
But I'm strong...

704
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:59,874
And you're weak.

705
00:38:59,884 --> 00:39:02,965
Break my bones...

706
00:39:02,975 --> 00:39:05,097
and strangle me.

707
00:39:07,066 --> 00:39:08,318
Too tired to care anymore.

708
00:39:08,328 --> 00:39:10,015
Q.

709
00:39:10,025 --> 00:39:12,496
You hurt him,

710
00:39:12,506 --> 00:39:14,063
you take one more pill,

711
00:39:14,073 --> 00:39:16,456
and you can build your body on your own.

712
00:39:20,905 --> 00:39:22,854
Fine.

713
00:39:22,864 --> 00:39:25,988
I'll take better care of the meat suit.

714
00:39:28,478 --> 00:39:32,472
But you don't have to be
such a baby about it.

715
00:39:40,258 --> 00:39:42,971
Hey, what happened with the game plan?

716
00:39:47,307 --> 00:39:50,048
Margo, are you okay?

717
00:39:51,826 --> 00:39:56,009
You stupid, stupid prick.

718
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:59,491
How dare you say I out-Elioted Eliot?

719
00:39:59,501 --> 00:40:01,014
Tell me?

720
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:04,104
Why would I ever want to do
anything without him?

721
00:40:04,114 --> 00:40:06,498
Hey, I'm sorry.

722
00:40:06,508 --> 00:40:08,326
I-I should have known
how you were feeling.

723
00:40:08,336 --> 00:40:11,938
Why? Because I like
fettuccini and I hate rosé,

724
00:40:11,948 --> 00:40:13,200
you think you know me?

725
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,506
You don't, Hoberman.

726
00:40:14,516 --> 00:40:16,551
Because if you did, you would know

727
00:40:16,561 --> 00:40:18,684
I don't need a new partner in crime.

728
00:40:18,694 --> 00:40:21,513
That's not...
I was just trying to help you.

729
00:40:21,523 --> 00:40:23,558
Bullshit.

730
00:40:23,568 --> 00:40:26,692
Now, I may be a cunt, but I am real.

731
00:40:26,702 --> 00:40:29,695
You? You're just a brown-nose
sweater boy

732
00:40:29,705 --> 00:40:34,700
desperate to matter at all to anyone.

733
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,354
Wow.

734
00:40:36,364 --> 00:40:38,530
And here I thought I was being a friend

735
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,662
who wants to be your boyfriend.

736
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:44,884
I really, really
got to work on the signals.

737
00:40:44,894 --> 00:40:47,901
- Josh, I didn't...
- Didn't mean to hurt me?

738
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:48,933
Yes, you did.

739
00:40:48,944 --> 00:40:52,423
Believe it or not, I know
exactly who you are, Margo.

740
00:41:03,912 --> 00:41:06,383
Took you long enough.

741
00:41:06,394 --> 00:41:08,734
I nearly gave up on you making it back.

742
00:41:08,744 --> 00:41:11,563
Yeah, well, magic was a
little scare in your timeline,

743
00:41:11,573 --> 00:41:14,087
so it took a minute to rebuild.

744
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:17,482
- Where's Marina?
- With her girlfriend.

745
00:41:17,492 --> 00:41:19,788
Listen, kid, we know
you're trying to look out

746
00:41:19,798 --> 00:41:20,920
for your mom.

747
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:22,095
We get it.

748
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:24,532
You saying you'll leave?

749
00:41:24,542 --> 00:41:27,230
Bigger things at play here.

750
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,156
Sorry, man. I'm not going anywhere.

751
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:36,293
- Is that...
- Yeah.

752
00:41:37,207 --> 00:41:41,723
- It's from another timeline.
- Please. Don't blow on it.

753
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:43,029
If you blow on it...

754
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:45,031
It'll spread seeds everywhere,

755
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:46,598
root itself in this timeline

756
00:41:46,608 --> 00:41:49,731
making it impossible for you to clean?

757
00:41:49,741 --> 00:41:51,211
I know,

758
00:41:51,221 --> 00:41:54,301
which is why I scattered
about ten of them an hour ago.

759
00:41:57,575 --> 00:41:59,132
I'm sorry.

760
00:42:09,107 --> 00:42:10,882
Hey!

761
00:42:10,893 --> 00:42:14,234
What are you waiting for?
It's clean! It got fixed!

762
00:42:14,244 --> 00:42:16,083
I'm serious!

763
00:42:16,094 --> 00:42:18,609
Come on, don't waste it!

764
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:23,309
Whoo!

765
00:42:24,472 --> 00:42:26,333
You can go on ahead if you want to.

766
00:42:26,343 --> 00:42:28,030
I'll... I'll meet you back at the house.

767
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,143
You sure?

768
00:42:29,154 --> 00:42:32,310
Yeah, I'm gonna stick around
a little while.

769
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:35,572
All right, I'll see you later.

770
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:48,007
- Thanks for calling me.
- I knew you'd want to know.

771
00:42:48,017 --> 00:42:50,836
- I owe you.
- Nah.

772
00:42:50,846 --> 00:42:52,838
This is for all of us.

773
00:43:23,835 --> 00:43:26,045
Sheila Cozener?

774
00:43:26,055 --> 00:43:27,883
You've been a busy girl.
