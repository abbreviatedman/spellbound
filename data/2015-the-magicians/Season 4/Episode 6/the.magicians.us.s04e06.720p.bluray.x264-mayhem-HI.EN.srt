me locate different worlds

Well, it is called
<i>The World Book.</i>

5
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:11,919
Okay, there's a spell in here that will
tell me where I'm supposed to go,

6
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,470
and I will stay there for good, okay?
Just let me help you.

It's the talking animals.

You want a spell? Deweys?

42

- Lose your virginity?
- You're not really my type.

you can totally have him.

That's... No, I don't
want sex or to hurt you.

on things to do

in or around Modesto?

fucking around here.

190
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,953
Yeah, honestly,
I'm more concerned

191
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,104
about what my girlfriend
will do if I don't make it back

As in a human
you give a shit about?

195
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,667
Yeah, and I'd rather not
lose her this time.

196
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:16,004
We were a thing back in timeline 23,
and I fucked it up.

197
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,965
You're telling me that you found
another one of her in timeline 40?

Yes.

199
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,787
And now that I know what she will
and won't put up with,

200
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,552
it's going so much
better this time.

201
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,263
- That's sociopathic.
- Dude, we're refugees.

202
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,294

advantages that come our way.

in this timeline?

at the stake.

Okay, but if he didn't,
he has no beef with us.

We take the thing to him.
If anyone can fix it, he can.

about that idea.

and the congregation
was there for me, so I still go.

Ah.

the whole back-and-forth thing,

find the lock box.

No idea what
you're talking about.

240
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,291
How the hell
did you just do that?

241
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,421
Same way you found the box.

did you?

That it was real
till you could do it.

count as weird.

00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,243
It's really rare, actually.

251
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,999
I've never met one,

252
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,955

you can't trust the Library.

273
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,759
Okay, I know that they told you
they'd give you more magic

274
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,571
if you signed up for a Library card,
but they won't, okay?

275
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,020
The Library card is just a way
for them to keep tabs on you.

276
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,696
Alice, I get it.

277
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,077
You know, whatever run-in
you had with them

278
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:37,703
clearly traumatized you.

this to be signing up for anything.

in Modesto because of me.

281
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:46,879
Right?

282
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:50,300
What if it's because you're supposed
to teach me everything?

283
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,258
No. Knowing more isn't better.

284
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:54,933
How could it not?

285
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,183
Because it's powerful
and it can be really, really bad.

286
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:02,312
Okay, look, I'm a grown woman,
you're a grown woman, we make choices.

I'm missing here?

Okay, listen,

289
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:09,323
I did a lot of stupid shit
when I was your age.

290
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,650
Yeah, so did I,

291
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,952

so much bigger and so much worse.

And if you regret it,

293
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,240
if you think about
those people that you hurt

294

that you wasted every single day,

295
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,122

00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,876
Look, I hear you.
I get it.

297
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:27,299
But it's what we
make of it, right?

298
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,377
And for me, it's...

299
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,344
It's like the first time that I can,
you know, turn things around,

300
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,097
maybe do something good.

301
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:42,641

to help me do that.

need to take this outside.

why do you smoke outside?

00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,681
Okay.

312
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,510
MARGO: I'll make this simple.
We need your beets.

313
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,186
At a fair price,
of course.

314
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:23,104
I doubt the
island of Clitswell...

315
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,854
- Codswall.
- Codswall.

316
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,186
- Anyway, I...
- Do you even know where Codswall is?

317
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,522
Of course.

318
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:34,199
It's one of the bigger...

319
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,447
Smaller fingering islands.

320
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:39,200
- Fingerling.
- Exactly. Fingerling.

321
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,657
Thank you, Your Majesty.

322
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,993
- For?
- Confirming my suspicion

323
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,248
that you've never had
consideration for us.

324
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:50,834
This makes my decision to sell
our beets to West Loria that much easier.

325
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:55,800
- Where the fuck is West Loria?
- West of Loria, Your Majesty.

326
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,756
- But since when?
- While you were Janet,

327
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:02,311
King Idri and his sister Ru,
had a squabble/slight war.

328
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:06,064
- Like a civil war?
- And as acting High King,

329
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,733
I asked myself, "What would
Margo or Eliot do?"

330
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,233
- Support our ally, Idri.
- Unfortunately, he lost.

331
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:16,317
Now Queen Ru rules
over West Loria.

332
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:20,620
And 'cause she's pissed we helped Idri,
she wants all Lady Pike's fresh beets?

333
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,493
Damn. That's cold.

334
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,246
Verily, they don't even have
talking animals in West Loria.

335
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,328
One problem at a time.

336
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:30,038
- The Cumdumpsterson twat...
- ALL: Codswall.

337
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,543
Oh, I know what I said.

338
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,045
I'm going to firebomb
the shit

339
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,252
out of her floating patch of dirt
and take her beets.

340
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:37,087
Bada-bing, bada-fuck her.

341
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:40,265
Could we be a tad
less incendiary?

342
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,762
Agreed.

343
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,515
What would Eliot do?

344
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,899
Eliot's not here, sweetie.

345
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,351
I am.

346
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:58,575
So, just to ask this,

347
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:01,995
can we really risk
war with West Loria?

348
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,414
Diplomacy was
Eliot's thing, Josh.

349
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,116
Diplomacy is what
got you elected.

350
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,953
I got elected because
I listened to a drunk bear

351
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,537
talk about his fee-fees.

352
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:14,295
- That's all diplomacy is!
- It was an accident.

353
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:18,504

about other people's shit.

Daniel, honey.

359
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,080
Come in before
someone sees you.

360
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,037
STOPPARD: Amazing.

361
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:56,000
I haven't seen anything like this since
before the exclusion laws.

362
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,169
I have one of these!

363
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,174
And it's missing
a spoke like mine.

364
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,971
What are the odds?

365
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,595
Anyway, this one, it didn't
come with a manual.

366
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,517
Do you have any ideas?

367
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,391
Well, it's hard
to explain, but I think...

368
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,017
Daniel, something's not...

369
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:13,688
Mom? Mom, what's wrong?

370
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,561
Something's wrong
with the spells.

371
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,989
Hold on,
I'll figure this out.

372
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,441
Quickly, while he's busy.

373
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:32,002
Found an outdated copy
of Taussig's <i>Primer</i> and a VCR manual.

374
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:35,297
This place has shit
for helpful books.

375
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,500
Well, at least it's standing.

376
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,710
I cannot believe a bunch
of militant muggles

377
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,841

Brakebills.

378
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:45,219
- What's that?
- Oh. It was Sonia's.

379
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,852
- You mean Stoppard's mother?
- I mean Sonia Kikuno,

380
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:52,227

pioneered horomancy.

381
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,104
This is easily one of the most
accidentally valuable things

382
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,310
I've ever stolen.

383
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:57,485
Here, look.

384
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,401
Wasn't that in
Stoppard's workshop?

385
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:03,905
Yeah. That screen
opens a window in time.

386
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:06,737
You can FaceTime
with the past as far back as 50 years.

387
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,244
It's genuinely genius.
Like, wow.

388
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,370
A lot of these spells
use cinnabar.

389
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,076
Hasn't that stuff
been banned for years?

390
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,584
Yeah, it causes severe
neuro-degeneration,

391
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:18,757
which is probably
what's happening with Sonia.

392
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,675
She's been
hitting the cinnabar

393
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,094
pretty hard for decades,
I imagine.

394
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,092
So,

395
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,640
she has
clockwork Alzheimer's?

hunted us down.

Stoppard is going to do
anything he can to kick us out.

00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,618
(SOFTLY) Um...

519
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:27,826
Bye.

520
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:29,125
(MUMMY GROANS INDISTINCTLY)

521
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:45,134
(GROANING)

522
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,971
- We can take a break.
- No, no, it's okay.

523
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:49,397
I want to keep going.

524
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,685
It bothers you, doesn't it?
That I'm so into this?

525
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,645
It just worries me.

526
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:59,323
For you, magic, you think
it just can fix everything,

527
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,617
but it kind of has a way
of breaking things.

528
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:04,206
Sometimes I feel like
everything that's gone wrong

529
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:06,831
in my life is 'cause of it.

530
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:12,796
Yeah, I used to say the same about alcohol,
about drugs, about money,

531
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,998
but none of that's
really good or bad.

532
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:17,960
It just is. It's how
you handle it, really.

533
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:21,005
(EXCLAIMS) Don't drink that.
The tap's got lead in it.

534
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:23,340
You got to drink the bottled water
out of the fridge.

535
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:26,551
- Why is there lead in the tap?
- City's pipes.

536
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,307
They're old and corroded.

537
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:30,555
Why don't they
just fix it?

538
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,811
That's cute,
that you think they would.

539
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,985
Asekian's Purification.

540
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,820
I can show you.
It's simple.

541
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:52,457
Can you do that
for the rest of the water supply?

542
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:56,001
No, or better yet, is there a spell
that would restore

543
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:59,255
- all the old pipes in Modesto?
- There is, but...

544
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,460
Okay, well, then do that.

545
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:01,795
Do it, please,

546
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:04,329
because you have no idea
how many people, how many kids are...

547
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:06,599
No, it's too big.
We can't do it.

548
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,223
There's not enough
ambient magic.

549
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:11,851
The Library,
it doles out the rest?

550
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:16,393
Wait.

551
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:19,945
You said that
they control the levels

552
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:24,734
of ambient magic that
flow through the pipes, right?

553
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,035
Yeah?

554
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:27,908
I can feel one.

555
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,951
They're everywhere.

556
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,499
No, no, no.

557
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,329
I think this one's different.

558
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,757
This one has a leak.

559
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,596
This isn't just food, Margo.

560
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,548
This is your secret weapon.

561
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:50,351
You can tell a lot about people
based on what they eat.

562
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:55,314
- Everything looks lovely.
- Thank you.

563
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,017
- Our chef is very...
- Talented.

564
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,602
Extra.

565
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,483
JOSH: I'll take that
as a compliment.

566
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,611
Like I was saying,
is she reserved, adventurous?

567
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,284
Maybe she's sexy and decadent

568
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:10,455
like a truffle lobster
mac and cheese.

569
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,953
Oh, interesting.

570
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:16,502
Mongoose cream egg
with caviar. She's bold.

571
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,752
Proud of her accomplishments,
but being so driven

572
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:23,175
has led her to be
lonely, misunderstood.

573
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:27,176
- Mmm.
- Tick said something about Codswall's polite alpacas.

574
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,178
Maybe she's proud
of that. Ask.

575
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:33,762
I hear Codswall
has upstanding alpacas.

576
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:38,107
It is a misconception
that alpacas have behavioral issues.

577
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:42,278
The truth is, they have a lack of
self-esteem from years of shearing.

578
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:45,482
Imagine being stripped naked twice,
even three times a year.

579
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:48,443
JOSH: There it is.
She's real into her 'pacas.

580
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:52,239
- Empathize with her.
- The indignity is real.

581
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:56,083
Like humans,
alpacas need affection

582
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,161
- and love.
- Preach.

583
00:29:58,505 --> 00:29:59,746
You may not know this,

584
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,833
but I ran on a platform
of animal equality.

585
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,667
My administration
is the first

586
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:07,344
to give talking animals
their rightful voice.

587
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:11,011
I mean, that is why
we're here tonight, right?

588
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:12,763
The animals.

589
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:16,312
I just care so damn much.

590
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:22,102
I like to drink my tea
with a splash of alpaca milk.

591
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:28,991
Would you like some?

592
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,569
JOSH: Uh, you can't
refuse this, Margo.

593
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,451
It's straight from
my dearest Delilah's teat.

594
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:42,715
JOSH: Uh-huh.

595
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:48,966
Do it, Margo.

596
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:53,633
Now!

597
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:56,723
Yeah, good.

598
00:30:58,148 --> 00:31:01,232
You are a champion.

599
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:03,526
You can really
taste the love.

600
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:07,613
What a beautiful way
to say it.

601
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,901
I'm afraid I may have judged
Your Majesty too quickly.

602
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,736
Same.

603
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:17,574
Which is why I would love it
if we could start fresh.

604
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:18,703
Your beets...

605
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:20,626
Unfortunately, I have
already agreed

606
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,419
to sell my beets
to West Loria,

607
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:24,623
and being a woman of my word,

608
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,207
I can't go back.

609
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,297
You understand, right?

610
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:33,006
I'm going to
check on dessert.

611
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,762
I'm about to
skin a bitch.

612
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,093
I want you to double down
on the charm offense.

613
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:40,601
You got her eating out of
your extra-diplomatic hands right now.

614
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,524
I guess I could lube her up
some more about her alpacas.

615
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:47,229
Yes, exactly. You, High King
Margo fucking Hanson,

616
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,813
you got this.

617
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,614
I know you didn't think
you could do this,

618
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,613
but, honestly,
I think you're out-Elioting Eliot.

619
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:55,320
(BELL DINGS)

620
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:58,157
Oh! Strawberry ricotta soufflé
is done. I'm gonna get that.

621
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,788
You get back to winning
at High King-in'.

622
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,507
- Margo, what are you doing?
- Being the real me.

623
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,633
Let me tell you how this
is going to play out, lady.

624
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,461
You're going to give me
those beets,

625
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:13,783
and I'm not going
to skin and eat

626
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:16,345
any of your tasty alpaca
children, <i>capisce?</i>

627
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:19,977
That's what I thought.

628
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:21,439
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,943

Hi.

631
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,374
I can't begin to imagine

632
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,453
how you fucked yourself
hard enough to get here, but...

(SIGHS)

634
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,001
...let's take advantage.

635
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:51,251
Interesting choice
on the hair.

636
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,381
Says the guy dressed
like an ambulance chaser.

637
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:58,008
- So you're dead me.
- Technically.

638
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,512
Does this mean
I'm dead, too?

639
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:04,013
No, no, this is a, uh,
kind of between space?

640
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,315
I saw you zapped yourself
here like an idiot,

641
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,358
and I took
a coffee break.

642
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:10,687
I mean, I've been
wanting to talk to you.

643
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,341
So then I assume you know
that I took your...

644
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:15,529
You took my spot
in my timeline? Yeah.

645
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,860
Didn't expect that twist
with Julia, though.

646
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,661
Yeah, I could say
the same about Kady.

647
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,710
For what it's worth,
it never felt right taking your place.

648
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,516
- But, you know...
- Everything feels wrong,

649
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:31,336
so you just pick something?
Yeah, of course I do.

650
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,758
Real talk... (CLAPS)

651
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,336
You gotta go back.

652
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,012
To 23, I know,
I'm working on it.

653
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,340
Uh, no. My timeline.

654
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:41,346
It's where you belong.

655
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,018
Okay, do you want
to cut the vague,

656
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:45,437
omniscient Librarian shit
and just tell me why?

657
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,099
It's complicated but crucial.

658
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:49,855
You do know
me existing there

659
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:53,109
is making some very important
horomancer lady very sick?

660
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,531
It's doing a lot more
than that.

661
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:59,076
Look, I know you lost
everyone you love in timeline 23...

662
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,528
Really?

663
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:03,080
But they're still alive
in timeline 40,

664
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,533
and if I were you,
which I am,

665
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:08,165
I'd do whatever
to not lose them again.

666
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:11,498
Okay, you might be me,

667
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:14,174
but you don't know me, okay?

668
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:15,672
Those shits are not my people.

669
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:19,513
Fair, but I know a little
about your future.

670
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,760
Perks of the gig.

671
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,092
So is being an abstruse dick
about it, apparently.

672
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:24,928
Sonia can't be saved.

673
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:27,513
Even if you go back to 23,
she's dead within a month.

674
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:30,775
It's terminal. Period.

675
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,838
Sounds like something I'd say to
make myself feel like less of an ass.

676
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:35,024
Bigger things at play
than your guilt, buddy.

677
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:36,401
You got to go back. Sorry.

678
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,153
That's as specific
as I can be.

679
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,451
Sorry? Are you?

680
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:44,281
Dude, I just jumped you clear
over 1,000 miles of bullshit.

681
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:48,542
So I'm sorry if it feels bad
in your soft little heart,

682
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:51,416
but, more importantly,
you're welcome.

683
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:54,582
But Kady wants you.

684
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:57,460
They all want you.

685
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,130
It's not
my timeline anymore.

686
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:04,638
It's yours.

687
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:09,931
So, you remember
that when the moment comes,

688
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:11,266
