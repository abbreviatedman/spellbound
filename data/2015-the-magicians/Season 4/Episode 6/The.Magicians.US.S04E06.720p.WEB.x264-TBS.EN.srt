Margo or Eliot do?"

Unfortunately, he lost.

Diplomacy was Eliot's thing, Josh.

Yeah. That screen
opens a window in time.

You can FaceTime with the past

It's genuinely genius.
Like, wow.

408
00:20:15,812 --> 00:20:17,901
A lot of these spells
use cinnabar.

409
00:20:17,945 --> 00:20:19,860
Hasn't... hasn't that stuff
been banned for years?

410
00:20:19,903 --> 00:20:23,385
Yeah, it causes severe
neuro-degeneration,

411
00:20:23,429 --> 00:20:25,474
which is probably what's
happening with Sonia.

412

She's been hitting the cinnabar

413
00:20:27,433 --> 00:20:29,870

I imagine.

414
00:20:29,913 --> 00:20:31,872
So...

531
00:26:04,067 --> 00:26:09,333
Uh, which was looted
shortly after.

It just worries me.

545
00:27:03,909 --> 00:27:07,565
For you, magic... you think
it just can fix everything,

546
00:27:07,608 --> 00:27:10,394
but it kind of has a way
of breaking things.

Sometimes I feel like
everything that's gone wrong

548

of that's really good or bad.

The tap's got lead in it.

water out of the fridge.

554
00:27:31,632 --> 00:27:34,766
- Why is there lead in the tap?
- City's pipes.

They're old and corroded.

of the water supply?

No, or better yet, is there
a spell that would restore

563
00:28:04,448 --> 00:28:07,494

There is, but...

564

Okay, well, then do that.
Do it, please, because you have

565

How many kids are...

Wait.

570
00:28:24,685 --> 00:28:27,950
You said that they control
the levels...

571
00:28:27,993 --> 00:28:32,955
of ambient magic that
flow through the pipes, right?

572
00:28:32,998 --> 00:28:34,260
Yeah?

573
00:28:34,304 --> 00:28:36,132

No, no, no, no, no.

I think this one's different.

577
00:28:46,446 --> 00:28:48,231
This one has a leak.

This isn't just food, Margo.

This is your secret weapon.

580
00:28:55,716 --> 00:28:59,851
You can tell a lot about
people based on what they eat.

581
00:28:59,895 --> 00:29:03,550
- Everything looks lovely.
- Thank you.

00:29:03,594 --> 00:29:06,249
Our chef is very...
Talented.

583
00:29:06,292 --> 00:29:07,685
Extra.

584
00:29:07,728 --> 00:29:09,513
I'll take that as a compliment.

585
00:29:09,556 --> 00:29:12,908
Like I was saying,
is she reserved, adventurous?

586
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:15,432
Maybe she's sexy and decadent

587
00:29:15,475 --> 00:29:18,783

Proud of her accomplishments,
but being so driven

592
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:31,404

to be lonely, misunderstood.

- Mm.
- Uh, Tick said something

594
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:35,408
about Codswall's polite alpacas.

595
00:29:35,452 --> 00:29:37,410
Maybe she's proud of that.
Ask.

596
00:29:37,454 --> 00:29:42,546
I hear Codswall
has upstanding alpacas.

597
00:29:42,589 --> 00:29:46,332
It is a misconception that
alpacas have behavioral issues.

598
00:29:46,376 --> 00:29:48,247
The truth is, they have a lack

599
00:29:48,291 --> 00:29:50,162
of self-esteem
from years of shearing.

600
00:29:50,206 --> 00:29:53,731

twice, even three times a year.

There it is.
She's real into her 'pacas.

602

Empathize with her.
The indignity is real.

603
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:04,307
Like humans,
alpacas need affection...

604
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:06,396
and love.
Preach.

00:30:06,439 --> 00:30:07,745
You may not know this,

606
00:30:07,788 --> 00:30:11,053

of animal equality.

607
