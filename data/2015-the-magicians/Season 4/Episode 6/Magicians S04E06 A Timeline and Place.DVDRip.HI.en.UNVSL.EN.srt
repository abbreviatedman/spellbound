me locate different worlds

00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:07,302
via a cooperative spell?

4
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:08,842
Well, it is called
<i>The World Book.</i>

5
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:11,936
Okay, there's a spell in here that
will tell me where I'm supposed to go,

6
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,481
and I will stay there for good,
okay? Just let me help you.

You want a spell? Deweys?

You're not really my type.

can totally have him.

That's... No, I don't
want sex or to hurt you.

If we help him collect
his stone organ prizes,

Yeah, honestly,
I'm more concerned

about what my girlfriend
will do if I don't make it back

As in a human you
give a shit about?

Yeah, and I'd rather
not lose her this time.

We were a thing back in
timeline 23, and I fucked it up.

another one of her in timeline 40?

Yes.

she will and won't put up with,

it's going so much
better this time.

you find the lock box.

you're talking about.

you just do that?

sudden, I could just feel it in my head.

you they'd give you more magic

if you signed up for a Library
card, but they won't, okay?

275

The Library card is just a way
for them to keep tabs on you.

What if it's because you're
supposed to teach me everything?

it can be really, really bad.

At a fair price, of course.

of Clitswell...

316
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:29,212
Anyway, I... Do you even
know where Codswall is?

317
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,553
Of course.

318
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:34,219
It's one of the bigger...

Thank you, Your Majesty.

322
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,032
For? Confirming my suspicion

323
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,265
that you've never had
consideration for us.

324
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:50,834
This makes my decision to sell our
beets to West Loria that much easier.

325
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:55,815
Where the fuck is West Loria?
West of Loria, Your Majesty.

326
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:57,783
But since when?
While you were Janet,

327
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:02,311
King Idri and his sister Ru,
had a squabble/slight war.

328
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:06,084
Like a civil war? And
as acting High King,

329
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,753
I asked myself, "What
would Margo or Eliot do?"

330
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:12,265
Support our ally, Idri.
Unfortunately, he lost.

331
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:16,325
Now Queen Ru
rules over West Loria.

332
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:20,635
And 'cause she's pissed we helped Idri,
she wants all Lady Pike's fresh beets?

333
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,504
Damn. That's cold.

334
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:25,272
Verily, they don't even have
talking animals in West Loria.

335
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,336
One problem at a time.

336
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:30,042

twat... ALL: Codswall.

337
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:31,550
Oh, I know what I said.

338
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,051
I'm going to firebomb the shit

339
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,281
out of her floating patch
of dirt and take her beets.

340
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,118
Bada-bing, bada-fuck her.

341
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:40,284
Could we be a tad
less incendiary?

342
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,793
Agreed.

343
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:44,524
What would Eliot do?

344
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:48,895
Eliot's not here, sweetie.

345
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,367
I am.

346
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:58,566
So, just to ask this,

347
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:02,012
can we really risk
war with West Loria?

348
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,448

Eliot's thing, Josh.

350
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,983

listened to a drunk bear

351

is! It was an accident.

360

361
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:56,000

363
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,205
And it's missing
a spoke like mine.

364
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:01,968
What are the odds?

365
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,601

didn't come with a manual.

367
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,410
Well, it's hard to
explain, but I think...

368
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,006
Daniel, something's not...

369
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:13,685

370
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:16,588

373
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:31,996

Taussig's <i>Primer</i> and a VCR manual.

379
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:48,855

mother? I mean Sonia Kikuno,

pioneered horomancy.

Wasn't that in
Stoppard's workshop?

385
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:03,936
Yeah. That screen
opens a window in time.

386
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:06,768
You can FaceTime with the
past as far back as 50 years.

387
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:09,274
It's genuinely
genius. Like, wow.

388
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,401
A lot of these
spells use cinnabar.

389
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:13,105
Hasn't that stuff been
banned for years?

390
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:16,616
Yeah, it causes severe
neuro-degeneration,

391
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,776
which is probably what's
happening with Sonia.

392
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:20,683
She's been hitting the cinnabar

393
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:23,120
pretty hard for
decades, I imagine.

394
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:25,124

We can take a break.
No, no, it's okay.

523
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:49,405
I want to keep going.

524
00:26:51,577 --> 00:26:53,705
It bothers you, doesn't
it? That I'm so into this?

525
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,680
It just worries me.

526
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:59,343
For you, magic, you think
it just can fix everything,

527
00:26:59,418 --> 00:27:01,614
but it kind of has a
way of breaking things.

528
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:04,214
Sometimes I feel like
everything that's gone wrong

529
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:06,816
in my life is 'cause of it.

530
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:12,830
Yeah, I used to say the same about
alcohol, about drugs, about money,

531
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:15,026
but none of that's
really good or bad.

532
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,968
It just is. It's how
you handle it, really.

533
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:21,039
(EXCLAIMS) Don't drink
that. The tap's got lead in it.

534
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:23,371
You got to drink the bottled
water out of the fridge.

535
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:26,571
Why is there lead in
the tap? City's pipes.

536
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,307
They're old and corroded.

537
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:30,575
Why don't they just fix it?

538
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,811
That's cute, that
you think they would.

539
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:44,023
Asekian's Purification.

540
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:45,826
I can show you. It's simple.

541
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:52,465
Can you do that for the
rest of the water supply?

542
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:56,041
No, or better yet, is there
a spell that would restore

543
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:59,272
all the old pipes in
Modesto? There is, but...

544
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,471
Okay, well, then do that.

545
00:28:00,546 --> 00:28:01,809
Do it, please,

546
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,320
because you have no idea how
many people, how many kids are...

547
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:06,613
No, it's too big.
We can't do it.

548
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,245
There's not enough
ambient magic.

549
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:11,847
The Library, it
doles out the rest?

550
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,418
Wait.

551
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:19,954
You said that they
control the levels

552
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,766
of ambient magic that flow
through the pipes, right?

553
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:26,031
Yeah?

554
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:27,903
I can feel one.

555
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,974
They're everywhere.

556
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,510
No, no, no.

557
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,344
I think this one's different.

558
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:39,751
This one has a leak.

559
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:45,624
This isn't just food, Margo.

560
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:47,557
This is your secret weapon.

561
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:50,357
You can tell a lot about
people based on what they eat.

562
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:55,329
Everything looks
lovely. Thank you.

563
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,029
Our chef is very... Talented.

564
00:28:58,103 --> 00:28:59,628
Extra.

565
00:28:59,705 --> 00:29:01,503
JOSH: I'll take that
as a compliment.

566
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,634
Like I was saying, is she
reserved, adventurous?

567
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:07,305
Maybe she's sexy and decadent

568
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:10,440
like a truffle lobster
mac and cheese.

569
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:12,981
Oh, interesting.

570
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:16,510
Mongoose cream egg
with caviar. She's bold.

571
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,752
Proud of her accomplishments,
but being so driven

572
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:23,193
has led her to be
lonely, misunderstood.

573
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:27,199
Mmm. Tick said something
about Codswall's polite alpacas.

574
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,167
Maybe she's proud of that. Ask.

575
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:33,762
I hear Codswall has
upstanding alpacas.

576
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:38,136
It is a misconception that
alpacas have behavioral issues.

577
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:42,306
The truth is, they have a lack of
self-esteem from years of shearing.

578
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:45,476
Imagine being stripped naked
twice, even three times a year.

579
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:48,451
JOSH: There it is.
She's real into her 'pacas.

580
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:52,253
Empathize with her.
The indignity is real.

581
00:29:52,758 --> 00:29:56,092
Like humans,
alpacas need affection

582
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,153
and love. Preach.

583
00:29:58,497 --> 00:29:59,760
You may not know this,

584
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:02,858
but I ran on a platform
of animal equality.

585
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:04,698
My administration is the first

586
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,330
to give talking animals
their rightful voice.

587
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:11,040
I mean, that is why
we're here tonight, right?

588
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:12,771
The animals.

589
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:16,303
I just care so damn much.

590
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:22,114
I like to drink my tea with
a splash of alpaca milk.

591
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:28,988
Would you like some?

592
00:30:29,061 --> 00:30:31,587
JOSH: Uh, you can't
refuse this, Margo.

593
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,462
It's straight from my
dearest Delilah's teat.

594
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:42,707
JOSH: Uh-huh.

595
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:48,974
Do it, Margo.

596
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,641
Now!

597
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,720
Yeah, good.

598
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:01,251
You are a champion.

599
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:03,522
You can really taste the love.

600
00:31:04,663 --> 00:31:07,633
What a beautiful way to say it.

601
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,935
I'm afraid I may have judged
Your Majesty too quickly.

602
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:13,767
Same.

603
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:17,606
Which is why I would love
it if we could start fresh.

604
00:31:17,676 --> 00:31:18,700
Your beets...

605
00:31:18,777 --> 00:31:20,643
Unfortunately, I
have already agreed

606
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,442
to sell my beets to West Loria,

607
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:24,642
and being a woman of my word,

608
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,207
I can't go back.

609
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:28,316
You understand, right?

610
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:33,020
I'm going to check on dessert.

611
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:34,787
I'm about to skin a bitch.

612
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,125
I want you to double
down on the charm offense.

613
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:40,632
You got her eating out of your
extra-diplomatic hands right now.

614
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:43,533
I guess I could lube her up
some more about her alpacas.

615
00:31:43,602 --> 00:31:47,266
Yes, exactly. You, High
King Margo fucking Hanson,

616
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:48,830
you got this.

617
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,637
I know you didn't
think you could do this,

618
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:53,611
but, honestly, I think
you're out-Elioting Eliot.

619
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:55,339
(BELL DINGS)

620
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:58,179
Oh! Strawberry ricotta soufflé
is done. I'm gonna get that.

621
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,776
You get back to
winning at High King-in'.

622
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:08,522
Margo, what are you
doing? Being the real me.

623
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,653
Let me tell you how this
is going to play out, lady.

624
00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:12,493
You're going to
give me those beets,

625
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:13,775
and I'm not going
to skin and eat

626
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:16,325
any of your tasty
alpaca children, <i>capisce?</i>

627
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:19,962
That's what I thought.

628
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:21,439
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

629
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:34,946
What in the hell?

630
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:39,221
Hi.

631
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,385
I can't begin to imagine

632
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,453
how you fucked yourself
hard enough to get here, but...

633
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:45,923
(SIGHS)

634
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:47,998
let's take advantage.

635
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:51,259
Interesting choice on the hair.

636
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:53,396
Says the guy dressed
like an ambulance chaser.

637
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:58,035
So you're dead me. Technically.

638
00:32:58,109 --> 00:32:59,509
Does this mean I'm dead, too?

639
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:04,045
No, no, this is a, uh,
kind of between space?

640
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:06,311
I saw you zapped
yourself here like an idiot,

641
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:08,376
and I took a coffee break.

642
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:10,718
I mean, I've been
wanting to talk to you.

643
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:12,333
So then I assume you
know that I took your...

644
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:15,521
You took my spot
in my timeline? Yeah.

645
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,895
Didn't expect that
twist with Julia, though.

646
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:19,659
Yeah, I could say
the same about Kady.

647
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:26,728
For what it's worth, it never
felt right taking your place.

648
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:28,467
But, you know...
Everything feels wrong,

649
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:31,339
so you just pick something?
Yeah, of course I do.

650
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:32,775
Real talk... (CLAPS)

651
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:35,375
You gotta go back.

652
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:37,006
To 23, I know,
I'm working on it.

653
00:33:37,082 --> 00:33:39,347
Uh, no. My timeline.

654
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:41,351
It's where you belong.

655
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:43,012
Okay, do you want
to cut the vague,

656
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:45,420
omniscient Librarian
shit and just tell me why?

657
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,122
It's complicated but crucial.

658
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:49,855
You do know me existing there

659
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:53,125
is making some very important
horomancer lady very sick?

660
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:55,525
It's doing a lot more than that.

661
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:59,093
Look, I know you lost everyone
you love in timeline 23...

662
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,536
Really?

663
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:03,097
But they're still
alive in timeline 40,

664
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:05,575
and if I were you, which I am,

665
00:34:05,644 --> 00:34:08,170
I'd do whatever to
not lose them again.

666
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:11,512
Okay, you might be me,

667
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:14,178
but you don't know me, okay?

668
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:15,686
Those shits are not my people.

669
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:19,521
Fair, but I know a
little about your future.

670
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:20,786
Perks of the gig.

671
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:23,090
So is being an abstruse
dick about it, apparently.

672
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:24,956
Sonia can't be saved.

673
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,522
Even if you go back to 23,
she's dead within a month.

674
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,794
It's terminal. Period.

675
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:32,847
Sounds like something I'd say to
make myself feel like less of an ass.

676
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:35,033
Bigger things at play
than your guilt, buddy.

677
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:36,438
You got to go back. Sorry.

678
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:38,170
That's as specific as I can be.

679
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,474
Sorry? Are you?

680
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:44,277
Dude, I just jumped you clear
over 1,000 miles of bullshit.

681
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:48,549
So I'm sorry if it feels
bad in your soft little heart,

682
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:51,419
but, more importantly,
you're welcome.

683
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:54,590
But Kady wants you.

684
00:34:55,961 --> 00:34:57,452
They all want you.

685
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,130
It's not my timeline anymore.

686
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:04,635
It's yours.

687
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:09,974
So, you remember that
when the moment comes,

688
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:11,270
I said, "Do it."

689
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:13,836
Do what he says, okay?

690
00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:16,177
No, not okay. Vague as shit.

691
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:18,506
(TICKING)

692
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:19,927
To go back to 40,
you're gonna want to

693
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,579
turn this dial three

695
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:27,982
and I'm sorry.

696
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:37,433
Well, thank Christ. I thought
you pissed off without me.

697
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:39,733
Where'd you go? It was, uh...

698
00:35:40,772 --> 00:35:42,673
I honestly don't
know how to explain it.

699
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:45,768
But I know what
we got to do now.

You were right, there's a crack.

703
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,266
I think it could split the pipe
open and let more ambient out.

00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,621
Once you pour it down the drain,

706
00:36:53,645 --> 00:36:54,855
it should clean
the water... Okay.

707
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,643
And clear the
corrosion from the pipes.

708
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:08,821

709
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,020

No, I just...

about him so much?

Because I do.

I should have known
how you were feeling.
