1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,537
<i>Previously on</i>
The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,628 --> 00:00:05,996
So this book is used to help
me locate different worlds

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:07,296
via a cooperative spell?

4
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:08,839
Well, it is called
<i>The World Book.</i>

5
00:00:08,926 --> 00:00:11,919
Okay, there's a spell in here that will
tell me where I'm supposed to go,

6
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,470
and I will stay there for good, okay?
Just let me help you.

7
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:17,048
This is just casual, right?
We're not...

8
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:20,852
I saved your life, bitch.
Casual that.

9
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:22,725
A talking lizard
of the Dunes.

10
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:26,023
Well, what's my birthright,
you scaly shit?

11
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:29,102
It's the talking animals.
They've all been struck dumb.

12
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,404
All those organs,
they're building blocks,

13
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,482
trying to piece together
a body.

14
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:34,907
Is it yours?

15
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:39,078
Eliot's alive. He's alive.

16
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,952
- So you're Team Monster now?
- I'm Team Eliot.

17
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:46,503
Your Penny's dead or not alive
in some confusing way.

18
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,750
- You're Kady?
- What's going on?

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,422
I'm not your Penny.

20
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:51,750
Marina.

21
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,835
I've been looking for you.

22
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,761
- Penny, right?
- I know you?

23
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,280
Ahh!

24
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,028
Well, it's about time
you woke up.

25
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,322
The hell?

26
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:21,029
I assume you remember
getting jumped.

27
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:26,790
Well, what happened next is you were sold
for 500 bucks and an Alpha Black Lotus...

28
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:28,961
Mint condish.

29
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,709
It's <i>Magic: The Gathering?</i>

30
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:33,626
Are you telling me that <i>Magic</i> cards
are actually magic?

31
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:36,879
No, just really expensive.

32
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:41,550
Excuse me.

33
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,062
Okay, you know this kid?

34
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:48,936
Not personally.
He's kind of a legend, though.

35
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,517
He's a horomancer.

36
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,398
You know, time magic,
fourth dimension shit.

37
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,274
Yeah, cool story.
Why am I in a cage?

38
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,985
Hey, Stoppard.

39
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:00,739
What is it you want, huh?
You want a spell? Deweys?

40
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:03,697
- Lose your virginity?
- You're not really my type.

41
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,827
Oh. Well, if he is,
you can totally have him.

42
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:10,332
That's... No, I don't
want sex or to hurt you.

43
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:11,833
I don't want any of that.

44
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,165
I just want you guys
to go back to your timeline,

45
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,091
where you belong.

46
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:20,930
Look, it's nothing personal.

47
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:24,305
Mmm. People in cages
is never not personal, sweetie.

48
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,933
You guys are creating
a frequency dissonance.

49
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,815
It's your quarks, subtle.

50
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,546
Most people wouldn't notice,
but what I do...

51
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,777
What are you doing?

52
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,775
You guys are
fucking up every spell.

53
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,948
Here's an idea,
adjust to our quarks.

54
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:40,741
They're subatomic.
How hard can it be?

55
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,365
Yeah, I tried that.
Didn't work.

56
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:45,117
So...

57
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:47,039
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

58
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:48,536
No, no, no.

59
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,913
- Welcome home, guys.
- Father fuck me.

60
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,590
That's weird.

61
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,093
It was just working
a minute ago.

62
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,286
Yeah, it's 'cause there was
magic in that timeline.

63
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,142
There ain't in timeline 23.

64
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,312
You gonna let me out?

65
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,738
Why would I?
You're a psychopath.

66
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:20,823
One, rude.

67
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,637
And, two, I know how to use that thing,
and you don't.

68
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,618
You're also
a compulsive liar, so...

69
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,742
Okay, well, you're
going to send yourself

70
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:30,576
to some cracked-out in-between space,
but whatever.

71
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,596
Don't screw this up.

72
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:49,435
Calm your man tits.
I got this.

73
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,606
Okay...

74
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,494
I thought you said
you knew how to use this thing.

75
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:05,578
Well, you should learn

76
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,102
to trust your instincts
about people.

77
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,517
Just relax, there's enough juice
in the Dewey for one more jump.

78
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,461
Let's just not use it
until we know how to, okay?

79
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:13,330
Sure, sure, cool, cool.

80
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,539
The vibe I'm getting
from this timeline is very <i>1984.</i>

81
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:23,302
Worse. It's <i>The Crucible.</i>

82
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,144
I don't know, Q.

83
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,977
If we help him collect
his stone organ prizes,

84
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,232
we can get him out of Eliot.
It's a good plan.

85
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:43,030
Unless we help him build

86
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,403
a completely indestructible
titan god body.

87
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:48,453
Well, he's already pretty murder-y.
It can't get much worse.

88
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,281
You say that like we
can just risk people's lives.

89
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,956
We've taken down gods before.

90
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:55,126
And we end up
losing every time.

91
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:56,212
It's Eliot.

92
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,204
Right now we can't

93
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:02,008
fix everything, but
I think that we can do this.

94
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,710
Okay, for now, we help The Monster,
but at the same time,

95
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,138
we also figure out
what our next move's going to be.

96
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:09,549
Thank you.

97
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,893
I don't know.
I guess I'm just worried.

98
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,916
- I can't help you if you...
- You're helping a lot.

99
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,681
I was a goddess,
and now I'm just

100
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:19,108
your friendly neighborhood
bulletproof vest.

101
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:22,028
I mean, you would be
a very high level X-Man.

102
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,113
Mmm?

103
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:24,564
Like Emma Frost's
diamond form.

104
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,024
- Mutant.
- A mutant.

105
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:29,110
Like The Indestructress.

106
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,829
The page you gave The Monster,
you remember what it says?

107
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,498
We didn't have time
to decipher it all.

108
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:35,978
I mean, there were
a lot of hieroglyphs.

109
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,710
Okay, do you remember
what hieroglyphs?

110
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,880
So I'm thinking,
like, so...

111
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:45,836
We've got two stone things
covered in hieroglyphs,

112
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,091
neither of which came
from an Egyptian god, so...

113
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,298
- Who did the writing?
- And why?

114
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:51,392
Um...

115
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,719
There were a lot
of these ones.

116
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,305
- What is that?
- A lot.

117
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,935
A yellow fruit?

118
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,397
- Is there a yellow fruit god?
- I don't know.

119
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,821
I don't remember anything
from any class at Brakebills.

120
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,900
Ooh! "Recently uncovered
tomb changes much

121
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:11,828
"of what archeologists thought they knew
about ancient Egypt."

122
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,701
Maybe stuff Brakebills
didn't know about.

123
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,248
Worth a shot.

124
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:28,719
Why Modesto, Alice?

125
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,592
Still trying
to figure that out.

126
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:32,423
My life, that is.

127
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,724
Oh.

128
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,345
I like your bunnies.

129
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,187
They were my mom's.

130
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:41,857
Well, she had lovely taste
in glass animals.

131
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,607
No drugs, no booze,
no bullshit.

132
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:47,484
You want to smoke,
you do it outside,

133
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,406
and the rent is due
on the 5th.

134
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,992
- I understand.
- Okay.

135
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,324
I'll show you
to your room.

136
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,533
Oh. Um, just
one more question...

137
00:06:58,627 --> 00:07:01,461
What is there to do
in, uh, Modesto?

138
00:07:03,715 --> 00:07:05,377
Shit-all, really.

139
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,762
So then why is it here
if it's native to Loria?

140
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,682
We're unsure, but since
the return of magic,

141
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,886
the Atros flower has been found blooming
all over Fillory.

142
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,562
Its pollen is why
the talking animals can't speak.

143
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:23,483
Allergies are why
my birthright lizard ain't saying shit?

144
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,480
Wait, if the bunnies
can't talk,

145
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,278
that means that we're cut of
from everyone else back on Earth.

146
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,593
How am I going to remind them
to water my rosemary plants?

147
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,950
Or ask 23 to blip
our asses back.

148
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,153
- That, too.
- There is good news.

149
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:38,122
- We found a remedy.
- The juice from a beet

150
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,325
that grows on one of
the smaller fingerling isles,

151
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,875
Codswall.

152
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,750
Best known for their
inordinately polite alpacas.

153
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,669
- Alpacas can be supreme dicks.
- Great.

154
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,921
Get a ship to Cockswallow.

155
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,927
- Codswall.
- Codswall.

156
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,339
Juice the beets,
distribute, done.

157
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:59,097
There's one small,
minute, trivial,

158
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:02,225
infinitesimally minuscule,
itty-bitty problem.

159
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:06,105
Lady Pike, who rules Codswall,
has been known to be, uh...

160
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:09,524
Difficult.

161
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,571
Are you saying she's a bitch?

162
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,367
Good thing I'm not
one at all, then.

163
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,324
Stop laughing.

164
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:27,205
That it?

165
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,212
Do you have any suggestions
on things to do

166
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,633
in or around Modesto?

167
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,503
Don't die of boredom?

168
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,094
I like your tattoos.

169
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,599
Mmm-hmm.

170
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,612
Hard getting by with
all those shortages, huh?

171
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,060
Yeah, maybe for
the classically trained.

172
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,564
Cockroaches like me,
we do what we got to.

173
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:52,404
Always have.

174
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,108
- Get over there!
- I didn't do anything.

175
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,014
They're just tattoos.
They don't mean anything.

176
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,154
Keep moving.

177
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,079
They are not
fucking around here.

178
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,953
Yeah, honestly,
I'm more concerned

179
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,104
about what my girlfriend
will do if I don't make it back

180
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:06,539
in time for her birthday.

181
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,086
You have a girlfriend?

182
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:09,584
As in a human
you give a shit about?

183
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,667
Yeah, and I'd rather not
lose her this time.

184
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:16,004
We were a thing back in timeline 23,
and I fucked it up.

185
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,965
You're telling me that you found
another one of her in timeline 40?

186
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,059
Yes.

187
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,787
And now that I know what she will
and won't put up with,

188
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,552
it's going so much
better this time.

189
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,263
- That's sociopathic.
- Dude, we're refugees.

190
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,294
We deserve any and all
advantages that come our way.

191
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,059
Yeah, like penthouse
apartments?

192
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,611
'Cause I don't know
any refugees that live like that.

193
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,551
You want that thing? You can have it.
It's way more trouble than it's worth.

194
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,783
Hey, crazy pitch...

195
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:41,112
What if we asked
Stoppard for help here?

196
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,198
Like the Stoppard
in this timeline?

197
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,748
Probably got burned
at the stake.

198
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,746
Okay, but if he didn't,
he has no beef with us.

199
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:50,125
We take the thing to him.
If anyone can fix it, he can.

200
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:52,081
There's so much terrible
about that idea.

201
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,211
Okay, do you know

202
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,883
another horomancer? No?

203
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,674
Then let's go.

204
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:14,737
<i>Brothers and sisters,
when things are lost,</i>

205
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,773
<i>they want to be found.</i>

206
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,280
<i>Ms. Ross' engagement ring,</i>

207
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,488
<i>little Joey Mireles' dog...</i>

208
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,790
<i>That we will find the money</i>

209
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,664
<i>to pay for Kiersten Bron's
leukemia treatment.</i>

210
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,417
- Tea?
- Uh, no, thank you.

211
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,133
Um, do you know
Reverend Ted Grayson?

212
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,051
Yeah, he's my minister.

213
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,923
He's a little theatrical at
times, but he's a good man.

214
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,016
Why, are you religious?

215
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:45,969
Not really. You?

216
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,519
No.

217
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,187
My mom was.

218
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,732
I was on probation
when she passed,

219
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:56,358
and the congregation
was there for me, so I still go.

220
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:40,782
Ah.

221
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,677
Look, I'm not good at
the whole back-and-forth thing,

222
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:24,862
so I'm just going to say it.

223
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:27,195
I saw you. I saw you
find the lock box.

224
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,654
You followed me?

225
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:29,989
How did you know where to dig?

226
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,166
No idea what
you're talking about.

227
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,291
How the hell
did you just do that?

228
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,421
Same way you found the box.

229
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,718
I'm a magician. Like you.

230
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,888
You had no idea,
did you?

231
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:53,016
That it was real
till you could do it.

232
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:56,273
You can talk to me.

233
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:58,772
To me, this doesn't even
count as weird.

234
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:04,441
It just started a couple
of months ago.

235
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:11,827
I lost my keys, and then all of a sudden,
I could just feel it in my head.

236
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,623
You're a quaeromancer.

237
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,243
It's really rare, actually.

238
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,999
I've never met one,

239
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:19,955
and I went to a school
full of people like us.

240
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,633
- Are you shitting me?
- Nope.

241
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,628
They can do
all kinds of things.

242
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:27,658
Most people don't figure out
their thing until their 20s,

243
00:13:27,682 --> 00:13:30,675
but every now and then, somebody...
It takes them longer.

244
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,009
Have you told anyone?

245
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:35,104
They would
think I was nuts.

246
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:37,731
Honestly,

247
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:42,110
it's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

248
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:43,732
Do you know what I mean?

249
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,780
Well,

250
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,824
yes and no.

251
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,488
Sheila, I think you
might be why I'm here.

252
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:58,369
- Librarians.
- Librarians?

253
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:01,171
They can't know I'm here.
Please don't tell them.

254
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,673
Thanks, but I'm
not interested.

255
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,635
Sheila Cozener?
I'm Paul, this is Laurel,

256
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:13,183
and we'd like to talk to you
about an opportunity.

257
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,306
One involving
your newfound talents.

258
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:24,520
Sheila, I am telling you,
you can't trust the Library.

259
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,759
Okay, I know that they told you
they'd give you more magic

260
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,571
if you signed up for a Library card,
but they won't, okay?

261
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,020
The Library card is just a way
for them to keep tabs on you.

262
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,696
Alice, I get it.

263
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,077
You know, whatever run-in
you had with them

264
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:37,703
clearly traumatized you.

265
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:41,128
I don't know enough about any of
this to be signing up for anything.

266
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:45,379
You said that you were
in Modesto because of me.

267
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:46,879
Right?

268
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:50,300
What if it's because you're supposed
to teach me everything?

269
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,258
No. Knowing more isn't better.

270
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:54,933
How could it not?

271
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,183
Because it's powerful
and it can be really, really bad.

272
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:02,312
Okay, look, I'm a grown woman,
you're a grown woman, we make choices.

273
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,268
Is there something
I'm missing here?

274
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:05,648
Okay, listen,

275
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:09,323
I did a lot of stupid shit
when I was your age.

276
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,650
Yeah, so did I,

277
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,952
and magic made it
so much bigger and so much worse.

278
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,779
And if you regret it,

279
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,240
if you think about
those people that you hurt

280
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,496
and all that time
that you wasted every single day,

281
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,122
then I know how you feel.

282
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,876
Look, I hear you.
I get it.

283
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:27,299
But it's what we
make of it, right?

284
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,377
And for me, it's...

285
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,344
It's like the first time that I can,
you know, turn things around,

286
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,097
maybe do something good.

287
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:42,641
But I need you
to help me do that.

288
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,269
Please!

289
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:51,907
All right, we are going to
need to take this outside.

290
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,451
If you own the house,
why do you smoke outside?

291
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,495
I don't know, it's my
mother's rules, I guess.

292
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,703
Always seemed kind of wrong
just breaking them

293
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,625
'cause she was gone.

294
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,956
Come on.

295
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,297
Okay.

296
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:14,262
Let's start with Popper 1.

297
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,681
Okay.

298
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,510
I'll make this simple.
We need your beets.

299
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,186
At a fair price,
of course.

300
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:23,104
I doubt the
island of Clitswell...

301
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,854
- Codswall.
- Codswall.

302
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,186
- Anyway, I...
- Do you even know where Codswall is?

303
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,522
Of course.

304
00:16:31,616 --> 00:16:34,199
It's one of the bigger...

305
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:36,447
Smaller fingering islands.

306
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:39,200
- Fingerling.
- Exactly. Fingerling.

307
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,657
Thank you, Your Majesty.

308
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,993
- For?
- Confirming my suspicion

309
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,248
that you've never had
consideration for us.

310
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:50,834
This makes my decision to sell
our beets to West Loria that much easier.

311
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:55,800
- Where the fuck is West Loria?
- West of Loria, Your Majesty.

312
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,756
- But since when?
- While you were Janet,

313
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:02,311
King Idri and his sister Ru,
had a squabble/slight war.

314
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:06,064
- Like a civil war?
- And as acting High King,

315
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,733
I asked myself, "What would
Margo or Eliot do?"

316
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,233
- Support our ally, Idri.
- Unfortunately, he lost.

317
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:16,317
Now Queen Ru rules
over West Loria.

318
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:20,620
And 'cause she's pissed we helped Idri,
she wants all Lady Pike's fresh beets?

319
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,493
Damn. That's cold.

320
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,246
Verily, they don't even have
talking animals in West Loria.

321
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:27,328
One problem at a time.

322
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:30,038
- The Cumdumpsterson twat...
- Codswall.

323
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,543
Oh, I know what I said.

324
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,045
I'm going to firebomb
the shit

325
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,252
out of her floating patch of dirt
and take her beets.

326
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:37,087
Bada-bing, bada-fuck her.

327
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:40,265
Could we be a tad
less incendiary?

328
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,762
Agreed.

329
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:44,515
What would Eliot do?

330
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,899
Eliot's not here, sweetie.

331
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,351
I am.

332
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:58,575
So, just to ask this,

333
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:01,995
can we really risk
war with West Loria?

334
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,414
Diplomacy was
Eliot's thing, Josh.

335
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,116
Diplomacy is what
got you elected.

336
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,953
I got elected because
I listened to a drunk bear

337
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,537
talk about his fee-fees.

338
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:14,295
- That's all diplomacy is!
- It was an accident.

339
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:18,504
I don't know how to intentionally care
about other people's shit.

340
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:21,515
Lucky for you,
that's all I do.

341
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,303
Fine.

342
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:28,514
One shot, Hoberman.

343
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,284
Hi, we're looking
for Stoppard.

344
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,951
Daniel, honey.

345
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:50,080
Come in before
someone sees you.

346
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,037
Amazing.

347
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:56,000
I haven't seen anything like this since
before the exclusion laws.

348
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,169
I have one of these!

349
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:00,174
And it's missing
a spoke like mine.

350
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,971
What are the odds?

351
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,595
Anyway, this one, it didn't
come with a manual.

352
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,517
Do you have any ideas?

353
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,391
Well, it's hard
to explain, but I think...

354
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,017
Daniel, something's not...

355
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:13,688
Mom? Mom, what's wrong?

356
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,561
Something's wrong
with the spells.

357
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,989
Hold on,
I'll figure this out.

358
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,441
Quickly, while he's busy.

359
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:32,002
Found an outdated copy
of Taussig's <i>Primer</i> and a VCR manual.

360
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:35,297
This place has shit
for helpful books.

361
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,500
Well, at least it's standing.

362
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,710
I cannot believe a bunch
of militant muggles

363
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,841
beat me to burning down
Brakebills.

364
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:45,219
- What's that?
- Oh. It was Sonia's.

365
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,852
- You mean Stoppard's mother?
- I mean Sonia Kikuno,

366
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:52,227
the genius who basically
pioneered horomancy.

367
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,104
This is easily one of the most
accidentally valuable things

368
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,310
I've ever stolen.

369
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:57,485
Here, look.

370
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,401
Wasn't that in
Stoppard's workshop?

371
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:03,905
Yeah. That screen
opens a window in time.

372
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:06,737
You can FaceTime
with the past as far back as 50 years.

373
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,244
It's genuinely genius.
Like, wow.

374
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,370
A lot of these spells
use cinnabar.

375
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,076
Hasn't that stuff
been banned for years?

376
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,584
Yeah, it causes severe
neuro-degeneration,

377
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:18,757
which is probably
what's happening with Sonia.

378
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,675
She's been
hitting the cinnabar

379
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,094
pretty hard for decades,
I imagine.

380
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,092
So,

381
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,640
she has
clockwork Alzheimer's?

382
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,348
Hmm, kind of,
but so much worse.

383
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,305
Your brain gets
unstuck in time.

384
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,159
You don't know
where you are or when you are,

385
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,100
and you can't
control it.

386
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:40,778
It is good, good times,
and then you die.

387
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:43,482
Yeah, but it seemed like
they had a treatment.

388
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,114
I mean, those weird watches
she had on?

389
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:49,288
Mmm, yeah, until
they got messed up

390
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,830
by us.

391
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:52,954
Must be
what started all this.

392
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,035
I mean,
back in timeline 40...

393
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:57,337
It's why Stoppard
hunted us down.

394
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:58,709
He's trying to save his mom.

395
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,960
Oh.

396
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,382
Now I almost
feel bad for him.

397
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:02,630
No, feel bad for us.

398
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,757
Even if we get back
to timeline 40,

399
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:07,305
Stoppard is going to do
anything he can to kick us out.

400
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,882
Unless we kill him.

401
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,719
For trying to save his mom?

402
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,350
Moms die every day.
Circle of life.

403
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:17,524
Wow. No!

404
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:20,610
We help him save her.

405
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:36,164
Am I just absorbing
a fuck-ton of cinnabar right now?

406
00:21:36,504 --> 00:21:38,962
Yeah, and breathing it.

407
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,832
Great.

408
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:45,214
Let's finish this
and get the hell out of here.

409
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,690
- Sonia?
<i>- Who are you?</i>

410
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:01,860
Friends of Daniel,
who's grown now.

411
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:03,979
Listen, we need
to talk to you

412
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:05,675
about that cinnabar
that you're using. It's...

413
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,442
<i>Frying my brain into
cheesecloth, I know.</i>

414
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:12,325
<i>Daniel used my designs to build
the device you're using.</i>

415
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,122
<i>We talked
a couple months ago.</i>

416
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:18,627
<i>If you were his friends,
you'd know that.</i>

417
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,499
He asked you to stop?

418
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,125
<i>Of course.</i>

419
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:24,549
<i>He also told me I'm about
to have a breakthrough</i>

420
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:26,501
<i>that creates
a whole new discipline.</i>

421
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,383
<i>I can't stop now.
My work's too important.</i>

422
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:30,884
Fair point.

423
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,307
So you're just going to pick

424
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:34,180
your clock shit
over your own kid?

425
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:38,688
<i>No, idiot. I choose both.</i>

426
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,187
<i>I designed devices
to counter the cinnabar,</i>

427
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:44,270
<i>tether my mind right here
with my work and my kid.</i>

428
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:49,028
<i>As long as I have these working for me,
I'll be fine.</i>

429
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,735
<i>I intend to die
a very old lady...</i>

430
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:53,912
<i>Sharp as a tack.</i>

431
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:58,583
Fuck her.
It's not our fault.

432
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:00,981
She knew the consequences,
and she still licked her paintbrushes.

433
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:03,247
We go back to 40,
we're taking the kid's mom away.

434
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,985
- I'm not doing that.
- Well, I'm not losing

435
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:06,921
my life because some horo-bitch
is a shitty mom.

436
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:08,752
She's shitty
so he should suffer?

437
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,554
We're the ones
who don't belong.

438
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,178
You know what?
You do you.

439
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,562
I'm going back to 40
and my future wife.

440
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,514
Don't touch me!

441
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,355
Shit.

442
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:36,164
Okay.

443
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,451
Quick.

444
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:51,587
- Anything?
- Nothing yet.

445
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,046
Keep looking.

446
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,679
Quentin.

447
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,724
Whoopsies.

448
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,310
Are you drunk?

449
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,859
This body hearts tequila

450
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,482
when I'm happy,
when I'm sad,

451
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:11,610
when I'm bored
because everything is taking too long,

452
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,407
meaning you.

453
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:14,951
Relevant story.

454
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:16,244
I was in a road,

455
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:20,700
and I almost got hit by,
what do you call it, a big fat truck.

456
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,955
But I wouldn't have
felt anything at all

457
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:24,832
because tequila
is my friend.

458
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:29,007
Um, you know, great news,

459
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:32,552
we've made good progress
finding that part of yours.

460
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,299
Um...

461
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:36,803
You wouldn't still happen
to have the paper I gave you?

462
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:41,053
Oh... I misplaced it.

463
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,513
Do you know anything about

464
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:46,896
an Egyptian god
of yellow fruit?

465
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:50,353
I'm not at all helpful
like this, am I?

466
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,528
What do you think?

467
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:56,360
You seem stressed by your vast
and obvious limitations.

468
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,139
Why don't we just ask

469
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,404
someone who was there?

470
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:16,096
You know, for having
such desiccated hands,

471
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,013
his Hieratic script's amazing.

472
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:22,973
What did he say?

473
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:27,641
Cut our poor mummy friend
some slack, Hoo-lia.

474
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:29,146
He took a hook
to the brain.

475
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,694
Of course, he's got a bit
of a speech impediment.

476
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,817
Oh,
uh, the yellow fruit.

477
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:38,201
It's a mandrake root,
and we are looking for Heka,

478
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:40,449
the god of magic
and medicine.

479
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,997
It looks like he's got
one of your stones.

480
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,574
Let's go kill him.

481
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:47,832
He's already dead.

482
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:52,499
Looks like he was buried
in the Temple of...

483
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:53,754
Uh...

484
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:55,210
Esna?

485
00:25:56,388 --> 00:26:00,348
Uh, which was
looted shortly after.

486
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,678
And where is it now?
My loot?

487
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,727
Yes, this is
very disappointing.

488
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,101
Figure this out
before I get mad.

489
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:15,860
This body craves
a cinnamon churro.

490
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:21,618
Um...

491
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:27,826
Bye.

492
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,971
- We can take a break.
- No, no, it's okay.

493
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:49,397
I want to keep going.

494
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,685
It bothers you, doesn't it?
That I'm so into this?

495
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,645
It just worries me.

496
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:59,323
For you, magic, you think
it just can fix everything,

497
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,617
but it kind of has a way
of breaking things.

498
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:04,206
Sometimes I feel like
everything that's gone wrong

499
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:06,831
in my life is 'cause of it.

500
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:12,796
Yeah, I used to say the same about alcohol,
about drugs, about money,

501
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:14,998
but none of that's
really good or bad.

502
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:17,960
It just is. It's how
you handle it, really.

503
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:21,005
Don't drink that.
The tap's got lead in it.

504
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:23,340
You got to drink the bottled water
out of the fridge.

505
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:26,551
- Why is there lead in the tap?
- City's pipes.

506
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,307
They're old and corroded.

507
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:30,555
Why don't they
just fix it?

508
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,811
That's cute,
that you think they would.

509
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,985
Asekian's Purification.

510
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,820
I can show you.
It's simple.

511
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:52,457
Can you do that
for the rest of the water supply?

512
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:56,001
No, or better yet, is there a spell
that would restore

513
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:59,255
- all the old pipes in Modesto?
- There is, but...

514
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,460
Okay, well, then do that.

515
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:01,795
Do it, please,

516
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:04,329
because you have no idea
how many people, how many kids are...

517
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:06,599
No, it's too big.
We can't do it.

518
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,223
There's not enough
ambient magic.

519
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:11,851
The Library,
it doles out the rest?

520
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:16,393
Wait.

521
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:19,945
You said that
they control the levels

522
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:24,734
of ambient magic that
flow through the pipes, right?

523
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,035
Yeah?

524
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:27,908
I can feel one.

525
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,951
They're everywhere.

526
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,499
No, no, no.

527
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,329
I think this one's different.

528
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,757
This one has a leak.

529
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,596
This isn't just food, Margo.

530
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,548
This is your secret weapon.

531
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:50,351
You can tell a lot about people
based on what they eat.

532
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:55,314
- Everything looks lovely.
- Thank you.

533
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,017
- Our chef is very...
- Talented.

534
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,602
Extra.

535
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,483
I'll take that
as a compliment.

536
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,611
Like I was saying,
is she reserved, adventurous?

537
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,284
Maybe she's sexy and decadent

538
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:10,455
like a truffle lobster
mac and cheese.

539
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,953
Oh, interesting.

540
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:16,502
Mongoose cream egg
with caviar. She's bold.

541
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,752
Proud of her accomplishments,
but being so driven

542
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:23,175
has led her to be
lonely, misunderstood.

543
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:27,176
- Mmm.
- Tick said something about Codswall's polite alpacas.

544
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,178
Maybe she's proud
of that. Ask.

545
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:33,762
I hear Codswall
has upstanding alpacas.

546
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:38,107
It is a misconception
that alpacas have behavioral issues.

547
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:42,278
The truth is, they have a lack of
self-esteem from years of shearing.

548
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:45,482
Imagine being stripped naked twice,
even three times a year.

549
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:48,443
There it is.
She's real into her 'pacas.

550
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:52,239
- Empathize with her.
- The indignity is real.

551
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:56,083
Like humans,
alpacas need affection

552
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,161
- and love.
- Preach.

553
00:29:58,505 --> 00:29:59,746
You may not know this,

554
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,833
but I ran on a platform
of animal equality.

555
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,667
My administration
is the first

556
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:07,344
to give talking animals
their rightful voice.

557
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:11,011
I mean, that is why
we're here tonight, right?

558
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:12,763
The animals.

559
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:16,312
I just care so damn much.

560
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:22,102
I like to drink my tea
with a splash of alpaca milk.

561
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:28,991
Would you like some?

562
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,569
Uh, you can't
refuse this, Margo.

563
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,451
It's straight from
my dearest Delilah's teat.

564
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:42,715
Uh-huh.

565
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:48,966
Do it, Margo.

566
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:53,633
Now!

567
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:56,723
Yeah, good.

568
00:30:58,148 --> 00:31:01,232
You are a champion.

569
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:03,526
You can really
taste the love.

570
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:07,613
What a beautiful way
to say it.

571
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,901
I'm afraid I may have judged
Your Majesty too quickly.

572
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,736
Same.

573
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:17,574
Which is why I would love it
if we could start fresh.

574
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:18,703
Your beets...

575
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:20,626
Unfortunately, I have
already agreed

576
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,419
to sell my beets
to West Loria,

577
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:24,623
and being a woman of my word,

578
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,207
I can't go back.

579
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,297
You understand, right?

580
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:33,006
I'm going to
check on dessert.

581
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,762
I'm about to
skin a bitch.

582
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,093
I want you to double down
on the charm offense.

583
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:40,601
You got her eating out of
your extra-diplomatic hands right now.

584
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,524
I guess I could lube her up
some more about her alpacas.

585
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:47,229
Yes, exactly. You, High King
Margo fucking Hanson,

586
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,813
you got this.

587
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,614
I know you didn't think
you could do this,

588
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,613
but, honestly,
I think you're out-Elioting Eliot.

589
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:58,157
Oh! Strawberry ricotta soufflé
is done. I'm gonna get that.

590
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,788
You get back to winning
at High King-in'.

591
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,507
- Margo, what are you doing?
- Being the real me.

592
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,633
Let me tell you how this
is going to play out, lady.

593
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,461
You're going to give me
those beets,

594
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:13,783
and I'm not going
to skin and eat

595
00:32:13,807 --> 00:32:16,345
any of your tasty alpaca
children, <i>capisce?</i>

596
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:19,977
That's what I thought.

597
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,943
What in the hell?

598
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:39,205
Hi.

599
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,374
I can't begin to imagine

600
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,453
how you fucked yourself
hard enough to get here, but...

601
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,001
...let's take advantage.

602
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:51,251
Interesting choice
on the hair.

603
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,381
Says the guy dressed
like an ambulance chaser.

604
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:58,008
- So you're dead me.
- Technically.

605
00:32:58,101 --> 00:32:59,512
Does this mean
I'm dead, too?

606
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:04,013
No, no, this is a, uh,
kind of between space?

607
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,315
I saw you zapped yourself
here like an idiot,

608
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,358
and I took
a coffee break.

609
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:10,687
I mean, I've been
wanting to talk to you.

610
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,341
So then I assume you know
that I took your...

611
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:15,529
You took my spot
in my timeline? Yeah.

612
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,860
Didn't expect that twist
with Julia, though.

613
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,661
Yeah, I could say
the same about Kady.

614
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:26,710
For what it's worth,
it never felt right taking your place.

615
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,516
- But, you know...
- Everything feels wrong,

616
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:31,336
so you just pick something?
Yeah, of course I do.

617
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,758
Real talk...

618
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,336
You gotta go back.

619
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,012
To 23, I know,
I'm working on it.

620
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,340
Uh, no. My timeline.

621
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:41,346
It's where you belong.

622
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:43,018
Okay, do you want
to cut the vague,

623
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:45,437
omniscient Librarian shit
and just tell me why?

624
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,099
It's complicated but crucial.

625
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:49,855
You do know
me existing there

626
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:53,109
is making some very important
horomancer lady very sick?

627
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,531
It's doing a lot more
than that.

628
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:59,076
Look, I know you lost
everyone you love in timeline 23...

629
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,528
Really?

630
00:34:00,622 --> 00:34:03,080
But they're still alive
in timeline 40,

631
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,533
and if I were you,
which I am,

632
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:08,165
I'd do whatever
to not lose them again.

633
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:11,498
Okay, you might be me,

634
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:14,174
but you don't know me, okay?

635
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:15,672
Those shits are not my people.

636
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:19,513
Fair, but I know a little
about your future.

637
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,760
Perks of the gig.

638
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,092
So is being an abstruse dick
about it, apparently.

639
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:24,928
Sonia can't be saved.

640
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:27,513
Even if you go back to 23,
she's dead within a month.

641
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:30,775
It's terminal. Period.

642
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,838
Sounds like something I'd say to
make myself feel like less of an ass.

643
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:35,024
Bigger things at play
than your guilt, buddy.

644
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:36,401
You got to go back. Sorry.

645
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,153
That's as specific
as I can be.

646
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,451
Sorry? Are you?

647
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:44,281
Dude, I just jumped you clear
over 1,000 miles of bullshit.

648
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:48,542
So I'm sorry if it feels bad
in your soft little heart,

649
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:51,416
but, more importantly,
you're welcome.

650
00:34:52,716 --> 00:34:54,582
But Kady wants you.

651
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:57,460
They all want you.

652
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,130
It's not
my timeline anymore.

653
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:04,638
It's yours.

654
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:09,931
So, you remember
that when the moment comes,

655
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:11,266
I said, "Do it."

656
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,817
Do what
he says, okay?

657
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:16,190
No, not okay.
Vague as shit.

658
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:19,927
To go back to 40,
you're gonna want to

659
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,567
turn this dial
three clicks to the right.

660
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:25,704
Tell Kady I love her,

661
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:27,990
and I'm sorry.

662
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:37,425
Well, thank Christ.
I thought you pissed off without me.

663
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,718
- Where'd you go?
- It was, uh...

664
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:42,676
I honestly don't know
how to explain it.

665
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,761
But I know what
we got to do now.

666
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,691
It's here.

667
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,361
Oh, God.

668
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:05,240
You were right,
there's a crack.

669
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,243
I think it could split the pipe open
and let more ambient out.

670
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,869
Here.

671
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:53,604
Once you pour it
down the drain,

672
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:54,855
- it should clean the water...
- Okay.

673
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,620
...and clear the corrosion
from the pipes.

674
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,807
Did I do something wrong?

675
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,009
Huh?

676
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:11,181
No, I just...

677
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:14,355
I can't remember the last time
that magic wasn't the problem.

678
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,816
This calls for
a drink.

679
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:27,819
Thank you.

680
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,902
Look, we'll find the stone. It'll be...

681
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:48,681
What are you doing?

682
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:54,432
Stop.

683
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,889
Jesus.

684
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,482
Those pills
can kill you.

685
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:07,487
I'll take a new body.
I'm bored.

686
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:11,787
You kill Eliot, and you can forget
about us helping you.

687
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:17,163
Eliot, Eliot, Eliot.

688
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,127
Why do you care
about him so much?

689
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:24,459
Because I do.

690
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,669
You kill him,
and we are done.

691
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,263
I swear to God,
I am serious.

692
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,137
I will abandon you,

693
00:38:32,227 --> 00:38:35,140
and I will die trying
to burn you to the ground.

694
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:42,943
That's cute.

695
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,984
But I'm strong...

696
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:50,617
And you're weak.

697
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,160
Break my bones,

698
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,873
and strangle me.

699
00:38:57,919 --> 00:38:59,080
Too tired to care anymore.

700
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,752
Q.

701
00:39:01,631 --> 00:39:04,920
You hurt him,
you take one more pill,

702
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,217
and you can build your body
on your own.

703
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,590
Fine.

704
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:16,723
I'll take better care
of the meat suit.

705
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:23,267
But you don't have to be
such a baby about it.

706
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,533
Hey, what happened
with the game plan?

707
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:40,535
Margo, are you okay?

708
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:46,587
You stupid, stupid prick.

709
00:39:46,676 --> 00:39:50,090
How dare you say
I out-Elioted Eliot?

710
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,761
Tell me. Hmm?

711
00:39:51,848 --> 00:39:54,682
Why would I ever want to do
anything without him?

712
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:57,350
Hey, I'm sorry.

713
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:59,224
I should have known
how you were feeling.

714
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:02,523
Why? Because I like fettuccine
and I hate rosé,

715
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:03,770
you think you know me?

716
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,271
You don't, Hoberman.

717
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,318
Because if you did,
you would know

718
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,271
I don't need a new
partner-in-crime.

719
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:12,108
That's not...
I was just trying to help you.

720
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,201
Bullshit.

721
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,450
Now, I may be a cunt,
but I am real.

722
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:20,283
You? You're just
a brown-nose sweater boy

723
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:23,790
desperate to matter at all
to anyone.

724
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:25,923
Wow.

725
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:28,965
And here I thought
I was being

726
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:30,668
a friend who wants
to be your boyfriend.

727
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:34,134
I really, really
got to work on the signals.

728
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:38,635
- Josh, I didn't...
- You didn't mean to hurt me?

729
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:39,844
Yes, you did.

730
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:42,305
Believe it or not, I know
exactly who you are, Margo.

731
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:55,943
Took you long enough.

732
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:58,954
I nearly gave up on you
making it back.

733
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:02,162
Yeah, well, magic was
a little scarce in your timeline,

734
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:04,664
so it took a minute
to rebuild.

735
00:41:04,754 --> 00:41:07,121
- Where's Marina?
- With her girlfriend.

736
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:11,508
Listen, kid, we know you're trying
to look out for your mom.

737
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:12,675
We get it.

738
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:14,219
You saying you'll leave?

739
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:16,797
Bigger things at play here.

740
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,050
Sorry, man.
I'm not going anywhere.

741
00:41:24,774 --> 00:41:26,936
- Is that...
- Yeah.

742
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:32,317
- It's from another timeline.
- Please. Don't blow on it.

743
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:33,614
If you blow on it...

744
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,612
It'll spread seeds everywhere,

745
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:39,328
root itself in this timeline,
making it impossible for you to clean?

746
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:41,747
I know,

747
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:44,371
which is why I scattered
about 10 of them an hour ago.

748
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:49,497
I'm sorry.

749
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,600
Hey!

750
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:04,812
What are you waiting for?
It's clean! It got fixed!

751
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,388
I'm serious!

752
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,349
Come on,
don't waste it!

753
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:13,479
Whoo!

754
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:16,861
You can go on ahead
if you want to.

755
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,613
I'll meet you
back at the house.

756
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:19,989
You sure?

757
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,038
Yeah, I'm gonna
stick around a little while.

758
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,871
All right,
I'll see you later.

759
00:42:35,762 --> 00:42:38,596
- Thanks for calling me.
- I knew you'd want to know.

760
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:41,424
- I owe you.
- Nah.

761
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:42,849
This is for all of us.

762
00:43:14,509 --> 00:43:16,626
Sheila Cozener?

763
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,301
You've been a busy girl.
