1
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,890
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,746
So this book is used to help
relocate different worlds

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:12,030
via a cooperative spell?

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:13,550
Well, it is called
the World Book.

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,746
Okay, there's a spell in here
that will tell me where

6
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:17,356
I'm supposed to go, and I will
stay there for good, okay?

7
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:18,770
Just let me help you.

8
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,340
- This is just casual, right?
- We're not...

9
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,520
- I saved your live, bitch.
- Casual that.

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,390
A talking Lizard of the Dunes.

11
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,700
Well, what's my birthright,
you scaly shit?

12
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,790
- It's the talking animals.
- They've all been struck dumb.

13
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:36,100
- All those organs...
- They're building blocks,

14
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,140
trying to piece together a body.

15
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,100
Is it yours?

16
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,760
- Eliot's alive.
- He's alive.

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,630
- So you're Team Monster now?
- I'm Team Eliot.

18
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:51,150
Your Penny's dead or not
alive in some confusing way?

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,420
- You're Kady?
- What's going on?

20
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,110
I'm not your Penny.

21
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,120
- Marina.
- Hmm.

22
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,550
I've been looking for you.

23
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,560
- Penny, right?
- I know you?

24
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:19,490
Ah!

25
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,840
Well, it's about time
you woke up.

26
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,140
What the hell?

27
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,880
I assume you remember
getting jumped.

28
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:29,280
Well, what happened
next is you were sold

29
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,630
for 500 bucks
and an Alpha Black Lotus...

30
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,810
Mint condish.

31
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,550
It's Magic the Gathering?

32
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,200
Are you telling me that
Magic cards are actually magic?

33
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,730
No, just really expensive.

34
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,300
Excuse me.

35
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,470
Okay, you know this kid?

36
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,780
- Not personally.
- He's kind of a legend, though.

37
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,350
He's a horomancer.

38
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,220
You know, time magic,
fourth dimension shit.

39
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,570
- Yeah, cool story.
- Why am I in a cage?

40
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,830
Hey, Stoppard.

41
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,050
What is it you want?

42
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,580
Huh? You want a spell?
Deweys?

43
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,540
- Lose your virginity?
- You're not really my type.

44
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,670
Oh. Well, if he is,
you can totally have him.

45
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:15,190
That's... No, I-I don't want
sex or to hurt you.

46
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,670
I don't want any of that.

47
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,020
I just want you guys
to go back to your timeline

48
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,900
where you belong.

49
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,470
Look, it's nothing personal.

50
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:29,900
Mm, people in cages is
never not personal, sweetie.

51
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:33,870
You guys are creating
a frequency dissonance.

52
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,650
It's your quarks... subtle.

53
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,326
Most people wouldn't notice,
but what I do...

54
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,610
What are you doing?

55
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,610
You guys are fucking up
every spell.

56
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,790
- Here's an idea...
- Adjust to our quarks.

57
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,570
- They're subatomic.
- How hard can it be?

58
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:48,230
- Yeah, I tried that.
- Didn't work.

59
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,970
So...

60
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,360
- Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- No, no, no, no, no.

61
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:58,760
- Welcome home, guys.
- Father fuck me.

62
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,420
That's weird.

63
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:08,070
It was just working
a minute ago.

64
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,096
Yeah, it's 'cause there
was magic in that timeline.

65
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,340
There ain't in timeline 23.

66
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,820
You gonna let me out?

67
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,570
- Why would I?
- You're a psychopath.

68
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,260
One, rude.

69
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,416
And, two, I know how to use
that thing, and you don't.

70
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,440
You're also
a compulsive liar, so...

71
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,580
Okay, well, you're going
to send yourself

72
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,360
to some cracked-out
in-between space, but whatever.

73
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,590
Don't screw this up.

74
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:54,290
- Calm your man tits.
- I got this.

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,130
Okay...

76
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,326
I thought you said you
knew how to use this thing.

77
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,986
Well, you should learn to
trust your instincts

78
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,570
about people.

79
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,206
Relax... there's enough juice
in the Dewey for one more jump.

80
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,320
Let's just not use it
until we know how to, okay?

81
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,190
Sure, sure, cool, cool.

82
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:22,580
The vibe I'm getting from
this timeline is very "1984."

83
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:28,150
Worse. It's "The Crucible."

84
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,990
I don't know, Q.

85
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,120
If we help him collect
his stone organ prizes,

86
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,080
we can get him out of Eliot.
It's a good plan.

87
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,870
Unless we help him build

88
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:50,260
a completely indestructible
titan god body.

89
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,960
Well, he's already
pretty murder-y.

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,350
It can't get much worse.

91
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,140
You say that like we
can just risk people's lives.

92
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,790
We've taken down gods before.

93
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,970
And we end up losing every time.

94
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,060
It's Eliot.

95
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,360
Right now we can't fix
everything,

96
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,840
but I think that we can do this.

97
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,540
Okay, for now, we help the
monster, but at the same time,

98
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:12,630
we also figure out what our
next move's going to be.

99
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,420
Thank you.

100
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,720
- I don't know.
- I guess I'm just worried.

101
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,706
- I can't help you if you...
- You're helping a lot.

102
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,510
I was a goddess,
and now I'm just

103
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:23,950
your friendly neighborhood
bulletproof vest.

104
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,390
I mean, you would be
a very high level X-Men.

105
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,650
Mm.

106
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,390
Like Emma Frost's diamond form.

107
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,870
- Mutant?
- A mutant.

108
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:34,870
Like The Indestructress.

109
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,400
The page you gave the monster...

110
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,660
You remember what it says?

111
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,360
We didn't have time
to decipher it all.

112
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,766
I mean, there
were a lot of hieroglyphs.

113
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:43,530
Okay, do you remember
what hieroglyphs?

114
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,710
So I'm thinking... like, so...

115
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,280
we've got two stone things
covered in hieroglyphs,

116
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,930
neither of which came
from an Egyptian god, so...

117
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,150
- Who did the raiding?
- And why?

118
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,420
Um, there were a lot of...

119
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,550
these ones.

120
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,160
- What is that?
- A lot.

121
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,680
A yellow fruit?

122
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,080
- Is there a yellow fruit god?
- I don't know.

123
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,650
I don't remember anything
from any class at Brakebills.

124
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:13,430
Ooh! Recently uncovered tomb
changes much

125
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,650
of what archeologists thought
they knew about Ancient Egypt.

126
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,530
Maybe stuff Brakebills
didn't know about.

127
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,050
Worth a shot.

128
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:31,760
â™ª

129
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,540
Why Modesto, Alice?

130
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,450
Still trying to figure that out.

131
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,280
My life, that is.

132
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,850
Oh.

133
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,030
- I like your bunnies.
- They were my mom's.

134
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,810
Well, she had lovely taste
in glass animals.

135
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:50,080
No drugs, no booze, no bullshit.

136
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,120
You want to smoke,
you do it outside,

137
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:54,300
and the rent is due on the 5th.

138
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,650
- I understand.
- Okay.

139
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,130
I'll show you to your room.

140
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:03,400
Oh, um, just
one more question...

141
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,310
what is there to do
in, uh, Modesto?

142
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,970
Shit-all, really.

143
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,580
So then why is it here
if it's native to Loria?

144
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,150
We're unsure, but since
the return of magic,

145
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,200
the Atros flower has been
found blooming

146
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,720
all over Fillory.

147
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,980
Its pollen is why the
talking animals can't speak.

148
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:26,720
Allergies are why
my birthright lizard

149
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,330
ain't saying shit?

150
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,770
Wait, if the bunnies can't talk,

151
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,340
that means that we're cut off

152
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,900
from everyone else
back on Earth.

153
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,186
How am I going to remind them
to water my rosemary plants?

154
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,780
Or ask 23
to blip our asses back.

155
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,000
- That too.
- There is good news.

156
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,830
- We found a remedy.
- The juice from a beet

157
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,180
that grows on one of
the smaller fingerling isles...

158
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,700
Codswall...

159
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,530
Best known for their
inordinately polite alpacas.

160
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,530
- Alpacas can be supreme dicks.
- Great.

161
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,670
Get a ship to Cockswallow.

162
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,280
Codswall.

163
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,190
Juice the beets,
distribute, done.

164
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,280
There's one small,
minute, trivial,

165
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:07,070
infinitesimally miniscule,
itty-bitty problem.

166
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:11,290
Lady Pike, who rules Codswall,
has been known to be, uh...

167
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,380
Difficult.

168
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,730
Are you saying she's a bitch?

169
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:20,040
Good thing I'm not one
at all, then.

170
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,950
Stop laughing.

171
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,180
- That it?
- Mm-hmm.

172
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,050
Do you have any suggestions
on things to do

173
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,880
in or around Modesto?

174
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,230
Die of boredom?

175
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:45,320
- I like your tattoos.
- Mm-hmm.

176
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:48,070
Hard getting by
with all those shortages, huh?

177
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:52,070
Yeah, maybe for
the classically trained.

178
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:55,330
Cockroaches like me,
we do what we got to.

179
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,250
Always have.

180
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,950
- Get over there!
- I didn't do anything.

181
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,796
They're just tattoos.
They don't mean anything.

182
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,990
Keep moving.

183
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,910
They are not
fucking around here.

184
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,610
Yeah, honestly,
I'm more concerned

185
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,870
about what my girlfriend
will do if I don't make it back

186
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:11,260
in time for her birthday.

187
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,920
You have a girlfriend?

188
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,326
As in a human
you give a shit about?

189
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,530
Yeah, and I'd rather not
lose her this time.

190
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,230
We were a thing back in
timeline 23,

191
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,310
and I fucked it up.

192
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,930
You're telling me that you found

193
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,620
another one of her
in timeline 40?

194
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,580
Yes. And now that I know what
she will and won't put up with,

195
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,240
it's going so much better
this time.

196
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,980
- That's sociopathic.
- Dude, we're refugees.

197
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,070
We deserve any and all
advantages that come our way.

198
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,890
Yeah, like penthouse apartments?

199
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,110
'Cause I don't know any
refugees that live like that.

200
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,656
- You want that thing?
- You can have it.

201
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,330
It's way more trouble
than it's worth.

202
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,640
Hey, crazy pitch...

203
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,950
What if we asked Stoppard
for help... here?

204
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,910
Like the Stoppard
in this timeline?

205
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:49,390
Probably got burned
at the stake.

206
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,276
Okay, but if he didn't,
he has no beef with us.

207
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,960
We take the thing to him.
If anyone can fix it, he can.

208
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,920
There's so much terrible
about that idea.

209
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,530
Okay, do you know
another horomancer? No?

210
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,310
Then let's go.

211
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,020
Brothers and sisters,
when things are lost,

212
00:10:18,070 --> 00:10:21,070
they want to be found...

213
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,600
Ms. Ross's engagement ring,

214
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,730
little Joey Mireles' dog...

215
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:30,080
That we will find the money

216
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,950
to pay for Kiersten Bron's
leukemia treatment.

217
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,690
- Tea?
- Oh, no, thank you.

218
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:39,440
Um, do you know
Reverend Ted Grayson?

219
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,920
Yeah, he's my minister.

220
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,880
He's a little theatrical
at times, but he's a good man.

221
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:49,270
- Why, are you religious?
- Uh, not really. You?

222
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,800
No.

223
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,490
My mom was.

224
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:55,020
I was on probation
when she passed,

225
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:59,680
and the congregation was there
for me, so I still go.

226
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,890
Look, I'm not good at
the whole back-and-forth thing,

227
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,150
so I'm just going to say it.

228
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,370
I saw you.
I saw you find the lock box.

229
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,640
You followed me?

230
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,960
How did you know where to dig?

231
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,550
No idea what
you're talking about.

232
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,520
How the hell did you
just do that?

233
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,610
Same way you found the box.

234
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,920
I'm a magician.
Like you.

235
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,180
You had no idea, did you?

236
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,050
That it was real
till you could do it.

237
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,580
You can talk to me.

238
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,010
To me, this doesn't
even count as weird.

239
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:07,760
It just started
a couple of months ago.

240
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,680
I, um... I lost my keys,
and then all of a sudden,

241
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,110
I could just feel it in my head.

242
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,860
You're a quaeromancer.

243
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,900
It's really rare actually.
I-I've never met one...

244
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:23,640
and I went to a school
full of people like us.

245
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:26,600
- Are you shitting me?
- Nope.

246
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,610
They can do all kinds of things.

247
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,886
Most people don't figure out
their thing until their 20s,

248
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,960
but every now and then,
somebody... it takes them longer.

249
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,310
Have you told anyone?

250
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,960
They would think I was nuts.

251
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,970
Honestly...

252
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,410
It's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

253
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,020
Do you know what I mean?

254
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,060
Well...

255
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:51,060
yes and no.

256
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,590
Sheila, I think you might be
why I'm here.

257
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:01,160
- Librarians.
- Librarians?

258
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,900
- They can't know I'm here.
- Please don't tell them.

259
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,340
Thanks, but I'm not interested.

260
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,350
Sheila Cozener?

261
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,910
I'm Paul, this is Laurel,

262
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,480
and we'd like to talk to you
about an opportunity.

263
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,570
One involving
your newfound talents.

264
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,360
Sheila, I am telling you,
you can't trust the Library.

265
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,970
Okay, I-I know that they told
you they'd give you more magic

266
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,890
if you signed up for a Library
card, but they won't, okay?

267
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:35,290
The Library card is just a way
for them to keep tabs on you.

268
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:36,980
Alice, I get it.

269
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,370
You know, whatever run-in
you had with them

270
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,980
clearly traumatized you.

271
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,720
I don't know enough
about any of this

272
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,200
to be signing up for anything.

273
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:48,690
You said that you were
in Modesto because of me.

274
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,210
Right?

275
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,600
What if it's because

276
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,600
you're supposed
to teach me everything?

277
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:56,560
- No.
- Knowing more isn't better.

278
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,220
How could it not?

279
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,480
Because it's powerful and it
can be really, really bad.

280
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,310
Okay, look, I'm a grown woman,

281
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,620
you're a grown woman,
we make choices.

282
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,570
Is there something
I'm missing here?

283
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,970
Okay, listen...

284
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:12,620
I did a lot of stupid shit
when I was your age.

285
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,670
Yeah, so did I, and magic
made it so much bigger

286
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:17,240
and so much worse.

287
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,500
And if you regret it,
if you think about those people

288
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,030
that you hurt and all
that time that you wasted

289
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,420
every single day,
then I know how you feel.

290
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,770
Look, I hear you.
I get it.

291
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,600
But it's what we make
of it, right?

292
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:34,380
And for me, it's...

293
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,170
it's like the
first time that I can,

294
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:37,650
you know, turn things around,

295
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:41,350
maybe... maybe do something good.

296
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:45,960
But I need you
to help me do that.

297
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,660
Please!

298
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,970
All right...

299
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,190
we are going to need
to take this outside.

300
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,760
If you own the house,
why do you smoke outside?

301
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,630
I don't know... it's
my mother's rules, I guess.

302
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,020
Always seemed kind of wrong
just breaking them

303
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:05,890
'cause she was gone.

304
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,200
Come on.

305
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,550
Okay.

306
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:18,430
Let's start with Popper 1.

307
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,000
Okay.

308
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,820
- I'll make this simple.
- We need your beets.

309
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,480
At a fair price, of course.

310
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,390
I doubt the island
of Clitswell...

311
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,130
- Codswall.
- Codswall.

312
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,570
Anyway, I...

313
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:32,490
Do you even know
where Codswall is?

314
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,840
Of course.

315
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,490
It's one of the bigger...

316
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,670
smaller fingering islands.

317
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:42,500
- Fingerling.
- Exactly. Fingerling.

318
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,980
Thank you, Your Majesty.

319
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,020
- For?
- Confirming my suspicion

320
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,330
that you've never had
consideration for us.

321
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,160
This makes my decision
to sell our beets

322
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,070
to West Loria that much easier.

323
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,950
- Where the fuck is West Loria?
- West of Loria, Your Majesty.

324
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,910
- But since when?
- While you were Janet,

325
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:05,560
King Idri and his sister, Ru,
had a squabble/slight war.

326
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,220
- Like a civil war?
- And as acting High King,

327
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,050
I asked myself, "What would
Margo or Eliot do?"

328
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:15,530
- Support our ally, Idri.
- Unfortunately, he lost.

329
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:19,620
Now Queen Ru
rules over West Loria.

330
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,530
And 'cause she's pissed
we helped Idri,

331
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,930
she wants all
Lady Pike's fresh beets?

332
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,360
Damn.
That's cold.

333
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,060
Verily, they don't even have

334
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:30,590
- talking animals in West Loria.
- On problem at a time.

335
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:33,330
- The Cumdumpsterson twat...
- Codswall.

336
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,770
Oh, I know what I said.

337
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,330
I'm going to firebomb the shit

338
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,550
out of her floating patch
of dirt and take her beets.

339
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,210
Bada bing, bada fuck her.

340
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,430
Could we be a tad
less incendiary?

341
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,080
Agreed.

342
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,950
What would Eliot do?

343
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,170
Eliot's not here, sweetie.

344
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,130
I am.

345
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:01,880
So... just to ask this,

346
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:05,140
can we really risk war
with West Loria?

347
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,710
Diplomacy
was Eliot's thing, Josh.

348
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,230
Diplomacy
is what got you elected.

349
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,240
I got elected because
I listened to a drunk bear

350
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,850
talk about his fee-fees.

351
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:17,590
- That's all diplomacy is!
- It was an accident.

352
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,030
I don't know how

353
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,810
to intentionally care
about other people's shit.

354
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,950
Lucky for you, that's all I do.

355
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,600
Fine.

356
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,820
One shot, Hoberman.

357
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,880
Hi, we're looking for Stoppard.

358
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,190
Daniel, honey.

359
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:53,370
Come in before someone sees you.

360
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:56,670
Amazing. I haven't seen
anything like this

361
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,240
since before the exclusion laws.

362
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:01,460
I have one of these!

363
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,460
And it's missing
a spoke like mine.

364
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,250
What are the odds?

365
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:07,900
Anyway, this... this one,
it didn't come with a manual.

366
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,820
Do you have any ideas?

367
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,690
Well, it's hard to explain,
but I think...

368
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,990
Daniel, something's not...

369
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,950
Mom? Mom, what's wrong?

370
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,870
Something... something's wrong
with the spells.

371
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:21,830
Hold on, I'll figure this out.

372
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,870
Quickly, while he's busy.

373
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,970
Found an outdated copy

374
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:34,670
of Taussig's Primer
and a VCR manual.

375
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,980
This place has shit
for helpful books.

376
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,200
Well, at least it's standing.

377
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,370
I cannot believe a bunch
of militant muggles

378
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:44,500
beat me
to burning down Brakebills.

379
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,900
- What's that?
- Oh, it was Sonia's.

380
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,510
- You mean Stoppard's mother?
- I mean Sonia Kikuno...

381
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:54,910
The genius who basically
pioneered horomancy.

382
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:58,080
This is easily one of the most
accidentally valuable things

383
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,080
I've ever stolen.

384
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,220
Here, look.

385
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,870
Wasn't that in
Stoppard's workshop?

386
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,570
Yeah. That screen
opens a window in time.

387
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:09,400
You can FaceTime with the past
as far back as 50 years.

388
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,660
It's genuinely genius.
Like, wow.

389
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,790
A lot of these spells
use cinnabar.

390
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,776
Hasn't... hasn't that stuff
been banned for years?

391
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,280
Yeah, it causes severe
neuro-degeneration,

392
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,370
which is probably what's
happening with Sonia.

393
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:23,280
She's been hitting the cinnabar

394
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,760
pretty hard for decades,
I imagine.

395
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,760
So...

396
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,640
she has clockwork Alzheimer's?

397
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,030
Mm, kind of, but so much worse.

398
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,770
Your brain gets unstuck in time.

399
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,120
You don't know where you are
or when you are,

400
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,780
and you can't control it.

401
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,430
It is good, good times,
and then you die.

402
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,170
Yeah, but... but it seemed
like they had a-a treatment.

403
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,790
I mean, those weird watches
she had on?

404
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,960
Mm, yeah, until they got
messed up...

405
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,490
by us.

406
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,620
Must be what started all this.

407
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,710
I mean, back in timeline 40...

408
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,010
It's why Stoppard
hunted us down.

409
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,360
He's trying to save his mom.

410
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:04,060
Oh... now I almost
feel bad for him.

411
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,320
Feel bad for us.

412
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:07,110
Even if we get back
to timeline 40,

413
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:09,980
Stoppard is going to do
anything he can to kick us out.

414
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,550
Unless we kill him.

415
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:14,380
For... trying
to save his mom?

416
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:17,030
- Moms die every day.
- Circle of life.

417
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,470
Wow!

418
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,340
No!

419
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,300
We help him save her.

420
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,090
Am I just absorbing

421
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,840
a fuck-ton of cinnabar
right now?

422
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,580
Yeah, and breathing it.

423
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,490
Great.

424
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:47,840
Let's finish this
and get the hell out of here.

425
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,380
- Sonia?
- Who are you?

426
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,510
Friend's of Daniel,
who's grown now.

427
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,080
Listen, we need to talk to you

428
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,300
about that cinnabar
that you're using. It's...

429
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:12,000
Frying my brain
into cheesecloth, I know.

430
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,870
Daniel used my designs to build
the device you're using.

431
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,270
We talked a couple months ago.

432
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:21,310
If you were his friends,
you'd know that.

433
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,180
He asked you to stop?

434
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,790
Of course.

435
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,230
He also told me I'm about
to have a breakthrough

436
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:29,190
that creates
a whole new discipline.

437
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:32,060
I can't stop now.
My work's too important.

438
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:33,540
Fair point.

439
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:35,890
So you're just going to pick
your clock shit

440
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,590
over your own kid?

441
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:41,380
- No, idiot.
- I choose both.

442
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,860
I designed devices
to counter the cinnabar,

443
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,820
tether my mind right here
with my work and my kid.

444
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,690
As long as I have these
working for me, I'll be fine.

445
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:54,430
I intend to die
a very old lady...

446
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,650
Sharp as a tack.

447
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,440
- Oh, fuck her.
- It's not our fault.

448
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,830
She knew the consequences,

449
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,570
and she still licked
her paintbrushes.

450
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,920
We go back to 40, we're
taking the kid's mom away.

451
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:07,596
- I'm not doing that.
- Well, I'm not losing

452
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,580
my life because some
horo-bitch is a shitty mom.

453
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:12,280
She's shitty
so he should suffer?

454
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,230
We're the ones who don't belong.

455
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,800
- You know what?
- You do you.

456
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,460
I'm going back to 40
and my future wife.

457
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,460
Don't touch me!

458
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:32,080
Shit.

459
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:41,170
Quick.

460
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:54,270
- Anything?
- Nothing yet.

461
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,450
Keep looking.

462
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,410
Quentin.

463
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:04,940
Whoopsies.

464
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,500
Are you drunk?

465
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:09,510
This body hearts tequila...

466
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,160
When I'm happy, when I'm sad,

467
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,290
when I'm bored because
everything is taking too long,

468
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,080
meaning you.

469
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,430
Relevant story... I was in a
road, and I almost got hit by...

470
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,000
What do you call it...
A big fat truck.

471
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,520
But I wouldn't have felt
anything at all

472
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:28,050
because tequila is my friend.

473
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,660
Um, you know, great news...

474
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:35,230
We've made good progress
finding that part of yours.

475
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:39,490
Um, you wouldn't still happen
to have the paper I gave you?

476
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:42,190
Oh, I...

477
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,720
misplaced it.

478
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,200
Do you know anything about...

479
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,460
an Egyptian god of yellow fruit?

480
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:53,030
I'm not at all helpful
like this, am I?

481
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,200
What do you think?

482
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,770
You seem stressed

483
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:58,510
by your vast
and obvious limitations.

484
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,560
Why don't we just
ask someone who was there?

485
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,050
You know, for having
such desiccated hands,

486
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,060
his Hieratic script's amazing.

487
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:25,840
What did he say?

488
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:29,810
Cut our poor mummy friend
some slack, Hoo-lia.

489
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:31,330
He took a hook to the brain.

490
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:33,850
Of course he's got a bit
of a speech impediment.

491
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,810
Oh, uh, the yellow fruit.

492
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:40,380
It's a mandrake root,
and we are looking for Heka,

493
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,600
the God of Magic and Medicine.

494
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,170
It looks like he's got
one of your stones.

495
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,740
Let's go kill him.

496
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,960
He's already dead.

497
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,920
Looks like he was buried
in the Temple of, uh...

498
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,960
Esna?

499
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:03,270
Uh, which was looted
shortly after.

500
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,840
- And where is it now?
- My loot?

501
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:12,110
Yes, this is very disappointing.

502
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:14,280
Figure this out
before I get mad.

503
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:18,420
This body craves
a cinnamon churro.

504
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,000
Bye.

505
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,800
Ah. Ah.

506
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,150
- We can take a break.
- No, no, it's okay.

507
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,370
I want to keep going.

508
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,850
It bothers you, doesn't it?
That I'm so into this?

509
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,810
It just worries me.

510
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:01,510
For you, magic... you think
it just can fix everything,

511
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:04,330
but it kind of has a way
of breaking things.

512
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,340
Sometimes I feel like
everything that's gone wrong

513
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,990
in my life is 'cause of it.

514
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:13,470
Yeah, I used to say the same
about alcohol, about drugs,

515
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,780
about money, but none
of that's really good or bad.

516
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:19,830
It just is.
It's how you handle it, really.

517
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:23,180
Uh, don't drink that.
The tap's got lead in it.

518
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,530
You got to drink the bottled
water out of the fridge.

519
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:28,710
- Why is there lead in the tap?
- City's pipes.

520
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,010
They're old and corroded.

521
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,710
Why don't they just fix it?

522
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:36,710
That's cute
that you think they would.

523
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:46,160
Asekian's Purification.

524
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,380
I can show you.
It's simple.

525
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,040
Can you do that

526
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,340
for the rest
of the water supply?

527
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:58,340
No, or better yet, is there
a spell that would restore

528
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:01,430
- all the old pipes in Modesto?
- There is, but...

529
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,766
- Okay, well, then do that.
- Do it, please, because you have

530
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:06,400
no idea how many people...
How many kids are...

531
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,490
- I... No, it's too big.
- We can't do it.

532
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:11,400
There's not enough
ambient magic.

533
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,230
- The Library...
- It doles out the rest?

534
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,580
Wait.

535
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,890
You said that they control
the levels...

536
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:26,900
of ambient magic that
flow through the pipes, right?

537
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,200
Yeah?

538
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,070
I can feel one.

539
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,120
They're everywhere.

540
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,640
No, no, no, no, no.

541
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:39,520
I think this one's different.

542
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:42,170
This one has a leak.

543
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:47,610
This isn't just food, Margo.

544
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:49,610
This is your secret weapon.

545
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:53,790
You can tell a lot about
people based on what they eat.

546
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,490
- Everything looks lovely.
- Thank you.

547
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:00,190
- Our chef is very...
- Talented.

548
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,630
Extra.

549
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:03,450
I'll take that as a compliment.

550
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:06,850
Like I was saying,
is she reserved, adventurous?

551
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:09,370
Maybe she's sexy and decadent

552
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:12,720
like a truffle lobster
mac and cheese.

553
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:15,120
Oh, interesting.

554
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,990
Mongoose cream egg with caviar.

555
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,690
She's bold.

556
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:21,910
Proud of her accomplishments,
but being so driven

557
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:25,340
has led her
to be lonely, misunderstood.

558
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,220
- Mm.
- Uh, Tick said something

559
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,350
about Codswall's polite alpacas.

560
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,350
Maybe she's proud of that.
Ask.

561
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:36,490
I hear Codswall
has upstanding alpacas.

562
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:40,270
It is a misconception that
alpacas have behavioral issues.

563
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,190
The truth is, they have a lack

564
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:44,100
of self-esteem
from years of shearing.

565
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:47,670
Imagine being stripped naked
twice, even three times a year.

566
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:50,630
- There it is.
- She's real into her 'pacas.

567
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:54,420
- Empathize with her.
- The indignity is real.

568
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:58,250
Like humans,
alpacas need affection...

569
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,340
- and love.
- Preach.

570
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,690
You may not know this,

571
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:04,990
but I ran on a platform
of animal equality.

572
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,860
My administration is the first

573
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:10,300
to give talking animals
their rightful voice.

574
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,180
I mean, that is why
we're here tonight, right?

575
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,920
The animals.

576
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,480
I just care so damn much.

577
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:21,530
I like to drink my tea with...

578
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,230
a splash of alpaca milk.

579
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,280
Would you like some?

580
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,540
Uh, you can't refuse this,
Margo.

581
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:37,630
It's straight from
my dearest Delilah's teat.

582
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,820
Uh-huh.

583
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,950
Do it, Margo.

584
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,910
Now!

585
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,870
Yeah, good.

586
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:03,400
You are a champion.

587
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,580
You can really taste the love.

588
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:09,800
What a beautiful way to say it.

589
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,060
I'm afraid I may have judged
Your Majesty too quickly.

590
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,930
Same...

591
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:17,760
which is why I would love it

592
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,900
if we could start fresh.
- Your beets...

593
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:23,420
Unfortunately, I have
already agreed to sell my beets

594
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,590
to West Loria,

595
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,810
and being a woman of my word,

596
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:28,380
I can't go back.

597
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,640
You understand, right?

598
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:35,170
I'm going to check on dessert.

599
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:36,780
I'm about to skin a bitch.

600
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:39,260
I want you to double down
on the charm offense.

601
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,610
You got her eating

602
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,790
out of your extra-diplomatic
hands right now.

603
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:45,700
I guess I could lube her up
some more about her alpacas.

604
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:49,400
Yes, exactly... you,
High King Margo Fucking Hanson,

605
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,970
you got this.

606
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:52,800
I know you didn't think
you could do this,

607
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,800
but, honestly, I think
you're out-Elioting Eliot.

608
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:59,320
Ah, strawberry ricotta soufflÃ©
is done.

609
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:00,800
I'm gonna get that.

610
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:03,370
You get back to winning
at High King-in'.

611
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,680
- Margo, what are you doing?
- Being the real me.

612
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,820
Let me tell you how this
is going to play out, lady.

613
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,640
You're going to give me
those beets,

614
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:16,650
and I'm not going to skin
and eat any

615
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:20,350
of your tasty
alpaca children, capisce?

616
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:22,000
That's what I thought.

617
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:34,320
â™ª

618
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,540
What in the hell?

619
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,500
â™ª

620
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,930
Hi.

621
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,980
I can't begin to imagine

622
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,410
how you fucked yourself
hard enough to get here,

623
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,590
but...

624
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:49,810
Let's take advantage.

625
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:52,860
Interesting choice on the hair.

626
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:56,080
Says the guy dressed
like an ambulance chaser.

627
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,600
- So you're dead me.
- Technically.

628
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,080
Does this mean I'm dead, too?

629
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:05,610
No, no, this is a-a, uh,
kind of between space?

630
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,910
I saw you zapped yourself here
like an idiot,

631
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,960
and I took a coffee break.

632
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,270
I mean, I've been wanting
to talk to you.

633
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:13,896
So then I assume you know
that I took your...

634
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:17,100
You took my spot
in my timeline? Yeah.

635
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,450
Didn't expect that twist
with Julia, though.

636
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:22,020
Yeah, I could say the same
about Kady.

637
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,280
For what it's worth, it never
felt right taking your place.

638
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:30,070
- But, you know...
- Everything feels wrong,

639
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:32,810
so you just pick something?
Yeah, of course I do.

640
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,460
Real talk...

641
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,070
You got to go back.

642
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,770
To 23, I know,
I'm working on it.

643
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,080
Uh, no. My timeline.

644
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,950
It's where you belong.

645
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,600
Okay, do you want to cut
the vague,

646
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:47,040
omniscient Librarian shit
and just tell me why?

647
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,700
It's complicated but crucial.

648
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:51,440
You do know me existing there

649
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,700
is making some very important
horomancer lady very sick?

650
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,880
It's doing a lot more than that.

651
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:00,660
Look, I know you lost everyone
you love in timeline 23...

652
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,100
Really?

653
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,670
But they're still alive
in timeline 40,

654
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,100
and if I were you, which I am,

655
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:09,760
I'd do whatever
to not lose them again.

656
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,850
Okay, you might be me,

657
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:15,770
but you don't know me, okay?

658
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,250
Those shits are not my people.

659
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:20,680
Fair, but I know a little
about your future.

660
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:22,250
Perks of the gig.

661
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:24,690
So is being an abstruse dick
about it, apparently.

662
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,520
Sonia can't be saved.

663
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,040
Even if you go back to 23,
she's dead within a month.

664
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,350
It's terminal. Period.

665
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:32,830
Sounds like something I'd say

666
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,366
to make myself
feel like less of an ass.

667
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:36,480
Bigger things at play
than your guilt, buddy.

668
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:39,750
You got to go back. Sorry.
That's as specific as I can be.

669
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:41,660
Sorry? Are you?

670
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:46,450
Dude, I just jumped you clear
over 1,000 miles of bullshit.

671
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:50,150
So I'm sorry if it feels bad
in your soft little heart,

672
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:54,020
but, more importantly,
you're welcome.

673
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:56,110
Kady wants you.

674
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:59,330
They all want you.

675
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:03,940
It's not my timeline anymore.

676
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:06,210
It's yours.

677
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:09,690
So, you remember...

678
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:13,740
that when the moment comes,
I said, "Do it."

679
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,390
Do what he says, okay?

680
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:18,000
- No, not okay.
- Vague as shit.

681
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,026
To go back to 40, you're
gonna want to turn this dial

682
00:35:22,050 --> 00:35:24,660
three clicks to the right.

683
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,580
Tell Kady I love her...

684
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,620
and I'm sorry.

685
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,500
Well, thank Christ.

686
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,020
I thought
you pissed off without me.

687
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:42,240
- Where'd you go?
- It was, uh...

688
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:45,550
I honestly don't know
how to explain it.

689
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:49,080
But I know what
we got to do now.

690
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,260
It's here.

691
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:03,960
Oh, God.

692
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,830
You were right...
There's a crack.

693
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,840
I think it could split the pipe
open and let more ambient out.

694
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,450
Here.

695
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:54,970
Once you pour it down the drain,

696
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:56,230
it should clean the water

697
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:59,230
and clear the corrosion
from the pipes.

698
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,420
- Did I do something wrong?
- Huh?

699
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,460
No, I just... I can't remember

700
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:17,470
the last time that magic
wasn't the problem.

701
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:20,820
This calls for a drink.

702
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,570
Thank you.

703
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,620
- Look, we'll find the stone.
- It'll be...

704
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,500
What are you doing?

705
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,730
Stop.

706
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:58,420
Jesus.

707
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,080
Those pills can kill you.

708
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:09,090
- I'll take a new body.
- I'm bored.

709
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:11,090
You kill Eliot...

710
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:13,660
and you can forget
about us helping you.

711
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:18,750
Eliot, Eliot, Eliot.

712
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:23,710
Why do you care
about him so much?

713
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:26,060
Because I do.

714
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:29,760
You kill him, and we are done.

715
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,850
I swear to God, I am serious.

716
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:33,590
I will abandon you,

717
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:36,720
and I will die trying
to burn you to the ground.

718
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:46,040
That's cute.

719
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,340
But I'm strong...

720
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,220
And you're weak.

721
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:55,310
Break my bones...

722
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:57,440
and strangle me.

723
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,660
Too tired to care anymore.

724
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,360
Q.

725
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,840
You hurt him,

726
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,400
you take one more pill,

727
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:08,800
and you can build your body
on your own.

728
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,190
Fine.

729
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:18,330
I'll take better care
of the meat suit.

730
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:20,810
â™ª

731
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:24,810
Mm, but you don't have to be
such a baby about it.

732
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:29,730
â™ª

733
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,350
Hey, what happened
with the game plan?

734
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,220
Margo, are you okay?

735
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:47,140
You stupid, stupid prick.

736
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:50,620
How dare you say
I out-Elioted Eliot?

737
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:52,140
Tell me, hmm?

738
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:55,230
Why would I ever want to do
anything without him?

739
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,630
Hey, uh, I'm sorry.

740
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,460
I-I should have known
how you were feeling.

741
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:03,070
Why? Because I like
fettuccini and I hate rosÃ©,

742
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:04,330
you think you know me?

743
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:05,640
You don't, Hoberman.

744
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,680
Because if you did,
you would know

745
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:09,810
I don't need
a new partner in crime.

746
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:12,640
- That's not...
- I was just trying to help you.

747
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:14,690
Bullshit.

748
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:17,820
Now, I may be a cunt,
but I am real.

749
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:20,830
You? You're just a brown-nose
sweater boy

750
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:25,830
desperate to matter
at all to anyone.

751
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:27,480
Wow.

752
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:29,660
And here I thought
I was being a friend

753
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,790
who wants to be your boyfriend.

754
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:36,010
I really, really
got to work on the signals.

755
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:39,190
- Josh, I didn't...
- Didn't mean to hurt me?

756
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,670
Yes, you did.

757
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:43,590
Believe it or not, I know
exactly who you are, Margo.

758
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,510
Took you long enough.

759
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,860
I nearly gave up
on you making it back.

760
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:02,690
Yeah, well, magic was a
little scare in your timeline,

761
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:05,220
so it took a minute to rebuild.

762
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:08,610
- Where's Marina?
- With her girlfriend.

763
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,920
Listen, kid, we know
you're trying to look out

764
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,050
for your mom.

765
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:13,230
We get it.

766
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:15,660
You saying you'll leave?

767
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:18,360
Bigger things at play here.

768
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,320
Sorry, man.
I'm not going anywhere.

769
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,460
- Is that...
- Yeah.

770
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:32,850
- It's from another timeline.
- Please. Don't blow on it.

771
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,160
If you blow on it...

772
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,160
It'll spread seeds everywhere,

773
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:37,730
root itself in this timeline

774
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:40,860
making it impossible
for you to clean?

775
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:42,340
I know,

776
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:45,430
which is why I scattered
about ten of them an hour ago.

777
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,260
I'm sorry.

778
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:02,010
Hey!

779
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:05,360
What are you waiting for?
It's clean! It got fixed!

780
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:08,060
I'm serious!

781
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:10,590
Come on, don't waste it!

782
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:15,590
Whoo!

783
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,460
You can go on ahead
if you want to.

784
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:19,160
I'll... I'll meet you
back at the house.

785
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,550
You sure?

786
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:24,300
Yeah, I'm gonna stick around
a little while.

787
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:27,430
All right, I'll see you later.

788
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,140
- Thanks for calling me.
- I knew you'd want to know.

789
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,970
- I owe you.
- Nah.

790
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:43,970
This is for all of us.

791
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,180
Sheila Cozener?

792
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,050
You've been a busy girl.
