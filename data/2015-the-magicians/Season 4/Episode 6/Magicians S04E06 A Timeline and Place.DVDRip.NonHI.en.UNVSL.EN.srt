1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,560
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,636 --> 00:00:06,004
So this book is used to help
me locate different worlds

3
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:07,302
via a cooperative spell?

4
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:08,842
Well, it is called
<i>The World Book.</i>

5
00:00:08,909 --> 00:00:11,936
Okay, there's a spell in here that
will tell me where I'm supposed to go,

6
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,481
and I will stay there for good,
okay? Just let me help you.

7
00:00:14,548 --> 00:00:17,074
This is just casual,
right? We're not...

8
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,848
I saved your life,
bitch. Casual that.

9
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:22,753
A talking lizard of the Dunes.

10
00:00:22,823 --> 00:00:26,055
Well, what's my
birthright, you scaly shit?

11
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:29,119
It's the talking animals.
They've all been struck dumb.

12
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:31,427
All those organs,
they're building blocks,

13
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:33,490
trying to piece together a body.

14
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:34,899
Is it yours?

15
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:39,098
Eliot's alive. He's alive.

16
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:41,971
So you're Team Monster
now? I'm Team Eliot.

17
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:46,503
Your Penny's dead or not
alive in some confusing way.

18
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,776
You're Kady? What's going on?

19
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:50,442
I'm not your Penny.

20
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:51,746
Marina.

21
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:53,852
I've been looking for you.

22
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:55,753
Penny, right? I know you?

23
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,268
Ahh!

24
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,040
Well, it's about
time you woke up.

25
00:01:18,045 --> 00:01:19,343
The hell?

26
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:21,041
I assume you remember
getting jumped.

27
00:01:21,114 --> 00:01:26,815
Well, what happened next is you were sold
for 500 bucks and an Alpha Black Lotus...

28
00:01:26,887 --> 00:01:28,981
Mint condish.

29
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:30,718
It's <i>Magic: The Gathering?</i>

30
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,618
Are you telling me that <i>Magic</i>
cards are actually magic?

31
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:36,892
No, just really expensive.

32
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,563
Excuse me.

33
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,073
Okay, you know this kid?

34
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:48,938
Not personally. He's
kind of a legend, though.

35
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,534
He's a horomancer.

36
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,409
You know, time magic,
fourth dimension shit.

37
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,277
Yeah, cool story.
Why am I in a cage?

38
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:57,011
Hey, Stoppard.

39
00:01:57,084 --> 00:02:00,748
What is it you want, huh?
You want a spell? Deweys?

40
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:03,723
Lose your virginity?
You're not really my type.

41
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:05,859
Oh. Well, if he is, you
can totally have him.

42
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:10,364
That's... No, I don't
want sex or to hurt you.

43
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,864
I don't want any of that.

44
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:14,197
I just want you guys to
go back to your timeline,

45
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:16,099
where you belong.

46
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:20,938
Look, it's nothing personal.

47
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:24,308
Mmm. People in cages is
never not personal, sweetie.

48
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,945
You guys are creating
a frequency dissonance.

49
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:31,847
It's your quarks, subtle.

50
00:02:31,918 --> 00:02:33,529
Most people wouldn't
notice, but what I do...

51
00:02:33,553 --> 00:02:34,782
What are you doing?

52
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:36,790
You guys are
fucking up every spell.

53
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:38,951
Here's an idea,
adjust to our quarks.

54
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:40,756
They're subatomic.
How hard can it be?

55
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,387
Yeah, I tried that. Didn't work.

56
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:45,125
So...

57
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:47,064
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

58
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:48,534
No, no, no.

59
00:02:51,405 --> 00:02:53,931
Welcome home,
guys. Father fuck me.

60
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:59,613
That's weird.

61
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,115
It was just working
a minute ago.

62
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,294
Yeah, it's 'cause there
was magic in that timeline.

63
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:07,150
There ain't in timeline 23.

64
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:14,327
You gonna let me out?

65
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,726
Why would I?
You're a psychopath.

66
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,828
One, rude.

67
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:22,645
And, two, I know how to
use that thing, and you don't.

68
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:24,638
You're also a
compulsive liar, so...

69
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,765
Okay, well, you're
going to send yourself

70
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,572
to some cracked-out
in-between space, but whatever.

71
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,589
Don't screw this up.

72
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:49,454
Calm your man tits. I got this.

73
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:58,604
Okay...

74
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,511
I thought you said you
knew how to use this thing.

75
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:05,578
Well, you should learn

76
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,085
to trust your instincts
about people.

77
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,525
Just relax, there's enough juice
in the Dewey for one more jump.

78
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,484
Let's just not use it until
we know how to, okay?

79
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,349
Sure, sure, cool, cool.

80
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,550
The vibe I'm getting from
this timeline is very <i>1984.</i>

81
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:23,322
Worse. It's <i>The Crucible.</i>

82
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,175
I don't know, Q.

83
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:39,008
If we help him collect
his stone organ prizes,

84
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,241
we can get him out of
Eliot. It's a good plan.

85
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:43,044
Unless we help him build

86
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,415
a completely
indestructible titan god body.

87
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:48,455
Well, he's already pretty
murder-y. It can't get much worse.

88
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:51,287
You say that like we can
just risk people's lives.

89
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:52,951
We've taken down gods before.

90
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:55,154
And we end up losing every time.

91
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,228
It's Eliot.

92
00:04:57,097 --> 00:04:58,224
Right now we can't

93
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:02,030
fix everything, but I
think that we can do this.

94
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:04,731
Okay, for now, we help The
Monster, but at the same time,

95
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:07,138
we also figure out what
our next move's going to be.

96
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:09,541
Thank you.

97
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,908
I don't know. I guess
I'm just worried.

98
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,880
I can't help you if you...
You're helping a lot.

99
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:16,712
I was a goddess,
and now I'm just

100
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:19,116
your friendly neighborhood
bulletproof vest.

101
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:22,054
I mean, you would be
a very high level X-Man.

102
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:23,122
Mmm?

103
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,590
Like Emma Frost's diamond form.

104
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:26,058
Mutant. A mutant.

105
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:29,119
Like The Indestructress.

106
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,827
The page you gave The Monster,
you remember what it says?

107
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,492
We didn't have
time to decipher it all.

108
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:35,978
I mean, there were
a lot of hieroglyphs.

109
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,733
Okay, do you remember
what hieroglyphs?

110
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,899
So I'm thinking, like, so...

111
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:45,844
We've got two stone things
covered in hieroglyphs,

112
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,108
neither of which came
from an Egyptian god, so...

113
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,309
Who did the writing? And why?

114
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:51,383
Um...

115
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:54,714
There were a lot of these ones.

116
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:57,322
What is that? A lot.

117
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,949
A yellow fruit?

118
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:02,427
Is there a yellow
fruit god? I don't know.

119
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,829
I don't remember anything
from any class at Brakebills.

120
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:08,926
Ooh! "Recently uncovered
tomb changes much

121
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:11,836
"of what archeologists thought
they knew about ancient Egypt."

122
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:14,739
Maybe stuff Brakebills
didn't know about.

123
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,242
Worth a shot.

124
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,716
Why Modesto, Alice?

125
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:30,620
Still trying to figure that out.

126
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,454
My life, that is.

127
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:33,720
Oh.

128
00:06:35,962 --> 00:06:37,362
I like your bunnies.

129
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:39,191
They were my mom's.

130
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,861
Well, she had lovely
taste in glass animals.

131
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:45,632
No drugs, no booze, no bullshit.

132
00:06:45,705 --> 00:06:47,503
You want to smoke,
you do it outside,

133
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,475
and the rent is due on the 5th.

134
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:52,011
I understand. Okay.

135
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,309
I'll show you to your room.

136
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:58,541
Oh. Um, just one
more question...

137
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:01,486
What is there to
do in, uh, Modesto?

138
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,385
Shit-all, really.

139
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:11,759
So then why is it here
if it's native to Loria?

140
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:14,699
We're unsure, but
since the return of magic,

141
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,897
the Atros flower has been
found blooming all over Fillory.

142
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:20,566
Its pollen is why the
talking animals can't speak.

143
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,508
Allergies are why my
birthright lizard ain't saying shit?

144
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:25,511
Wait, if the bunnies can't talk,

145
00:07:25,578 --> 00:07:28,309
that means that we're cut of
from everyone else back on Earth.

146
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,593
How am I going to remind them
to water my rosemary plants?

147
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,950
Or ask 23 to blip
our asses back.

148
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,147
That, too. There is good news.

149
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:38,147
We found a remedy.
The juice from a beet

150
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,352
that grows on one of the
smaller fingerling isles,

151
00:07:40,427 --> 00:07:41,895
Codswall.

152
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,830
Best known for their
inordinately polite alpacas.

153
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:47,697
Alpacas can be
supreme dicks. Great.

154
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,929
Get a ship to Cockswallow.

155
00:07:50,737 --> 00:07:51,932
Codswall. Codswall.

156
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:55,369
Juice the beets,
distribute, done.

157
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:59,106
There's one small,
minute, trivial,

158
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:02,206
infinitesimally minuscule,
itty-bitty problem.

159
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:06,116
Lady Pike, who rules Codswall,
has been known to be, uh...

160
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:09,550
Difficult.

161
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:11,591
Are you saying she's a bitch?

162
00:08:13,293 --> 00:08:15,387
Good thing I'm
not one at all, then.

163
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,321
Stop laughing.

164
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,201
That it?

165
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:30,240
Do you have any
suggestions on things to do

166
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,642
in or around Modesto?

167
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:33,545
Don't die of boredom?

168
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,117
I like your tattoos.

169
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,611
Mmm-hmm.

170
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,620
Hard getting by with all
those shortages, huh?

171
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,052
Yeah, maybe for
the classically trained.

172
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,561
Cockroaches like me,
we do what we got to.

173
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:52,395
Always have.

174
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:56,135
Get over there! I
didn't do anything.

175
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,014
They're just tattoos.
They don't mean anything.

176
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,165
Keep moving.

177
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:01,105
They are not
fucking around here.

178
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:02,972
Yeah, honestly,
I'm more concerned

179
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,087
about what my girlfriend
will do if I don't make it back

180
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,579
in time for her birthday.

181
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:08,114
You have a girlfriend?

182
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:09,615
As in a human you
give a shit about?

183
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:12,675
Yeah, and I'd rather
not lose her this time.

184
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:16,018
We were a thing back in
timeline 23, and I fucked it up.

185
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:18,991
You're telling me that you found
another one of her in timeline 40?

186
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,083
Yes.

187
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,771
And now that I know what
she will and won't put up with,

188
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:23,593
it's going so much
better this time.

189
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:26,292
That's sociopathic.
Dude, we're refugees.

190
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:28,277
We deserve any and all
advantages that come our way.

191
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,065
Yeah, like penthouse apartments?

192
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:32,628
'Cause I don't know any
refugees that live like that.

193
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:35,551
You want that thing? You can have
it. It's way more trouble than it's worth.

194
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,806
Hey, crazy pitch...

195
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:41,143
What if we asked
Stoppard for help here?

196
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:43,206
Like the Stoppard
in this timeline?

197
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:44,774
Probably got
burned at the stake.

198
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:46,752
Okay, but if he didn't,
he has no beef with us.

199
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,154
We take the thing to him.
If anyone can fix it, he can.

200
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:52,089
There's so much
terrible about that idea.

201
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,217
Okay, do you know

202
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:54,886
another horomancer? No?

203
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,697
Then let's go.

204
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:14,742
<i>Brothers and sisters,
when things are lost,</i>

205
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,807
<i>they want to be found.</i>

206
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:20,319
<i>Ms. Ross' engagement ring,</i>

207
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:23,481
<i>little Joey Mireles' dog...</i>

208
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,821
<i>That we will find the money</i>

209
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:29,692
<i>to pay for Kiersten
Bron's leukemia treatment.</i>

210
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:32,425
Tea? Uh, no, thank you.

211
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,133
Um, do you know
Reverend Ted Grayson?

212
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:38,034
Yeah, he's my minister.

213
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:41,940
He's a little theatrical at
times, but he's a good man.

214
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,032
Why, are you religious?

215
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:45,977
Not really. You?

216
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:47,536
No.

217
00:10:47,614 --> 00:10:49,207
My mom was.

218
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,751
I was on probation
when she passed,

219
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:56,347
and the congregation was
there for me, so I still go.

220
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:40,790
Ah.

221
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,686
Look, I'm not good at the
whole back- and-forth thing,

222
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,871
so I'm just going to say it.

223
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,209
I saw you. I saw
you find the lock box.

224
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,680
You followed me?

225
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,011
How did you know where to dig?

226
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,143
No idea what
you're talking about.

227
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,282
How the hell did
you just do that?

228
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,418
Same way you found the box.

229
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,729
I'm a magician. Like you.

230
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:50,897
You had no idea, did you?

231
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,996
That it was real
till you could do it.

232
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,269
You can talk to me.

233
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,777
To me, this doesn't
even count as weird.

234
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:04,446
It just started a
couple of months ago.

235
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:11,853
I lost my keys, and then all of a
sudden, I could just feel it in my head.

236
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,620
You're a quaeromancer.

237
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:16,260
It's really rare, actually.

238
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,025
I've never met one,

239
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:19,963
and I went to a school
full of people like us.

240
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,629
Are you shitting me? Nope.

241
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:25,631
They can do all kinds of things.

242
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:27,650
Most people don't figure
out their thing until their 20s,

243
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:30,701
but every now and then,
somebody... It takes them longer.

244
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:32,006
Have you told anyone?

245
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:35,115
They would think I was nuts.

246
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:37,716
Honestly,

247
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:42,116
it's the best thing that
ever happened to me.

248
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:43,747
Do you know what I mean?

249
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,792
Well,

250
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,827
yes and no.

251
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,488
Sheila, I think you
might be why I'm here.

252
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:58,400
Librarians. Librarians?

253
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:01,168
They can't know I'm
here. Please don't tell them.

254
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,679
Thanks, but I'm not interested.

255
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,647
Sheila Cozener? I'm
Paul, this is Laurel,

256
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:13,209
and we'd like to talk to
you about an opportunity.

257
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:15,312
One involving your
newfound talents.

258
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:24,558
Sheila, I am telling you,
you can't trust the Library.

259
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,775
Okay, I know that they told
you they'd give you more magic

260
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,598
if you signed up for a Library
card, but they won't, okay?

261
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:32,029
The Library card is just a way
for them to keep tabs on you.

262
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,699
Alice, I get it.

263
00:14:33,773 --> 00:14:36,106
You know, whatever
run-in you had with them

264
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:37,734
clearly traumatized you.

265
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:41,144
I don't know enough about any of
this to be signing up for anything.

266
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:45,413
You said that you were
in Modesto because of me.

267
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:46,885
Right?

268
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:50,319
What if it's because you're
supposed to teach me everything?

269
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,292
No. Knowing more isn't better.

270
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:54,952
How could it not?

271
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:58,191
Because it's powerful and
it can be really, really bad.

272
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:02,326
Okay, look, I'm a grown woman,
you're a grown woman, we make choices.

273
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,303
Is there something
I'm missing here?

274
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,633
Okay, listen,

275
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:09,342
I did a lot of stupid shit
when I was your age.

276
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,672
Yeah, so did I,

277
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,975
and magic made it so much
bigger and so much worse.

278
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:15,810
And if you regret it,

279
00:15:15,882 --> 00:15:18,283
if you think about those
people that you hurt

280
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:20,513
and all that time that you
wasted every single day,

281
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,145
then I know how you feel.

282
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:24,884
Look, I hear you. I get it.

283
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:27,324
But it's what we
make of it, right?

284
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:29,385
And for me, it's...

285
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:34,361
It's like the first time that I can,
you know, turn things around,

286
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,097
maybe do something good.

287
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:42,675
But I need you
to help me do that.

288
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:44,267
Please!

289
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:51,915
All right, we are going to
need to take this outside.

290
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:54,453
If you own the house,
why do you smoke outside?

291
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,489
I don't know, it's my
mother's rules, I guess.

292
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:00,718
Always seemed kind of
wrong just breaking them

293
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,625
'cause she was gone.

294
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:07,962
Come on.

295
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,297
Okay.

296
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:14,268
Let's start with Popper 1.

297
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:16,709
Okay.

298
00:16:16,776 --> 00:16:19,541
I'll make this simple.
We need your beets.

299
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:21,205
At a fair price, of course.

300
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,112
I doubt the island
of Clitswell...

301
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:25,845
Codswall. Codswall.

302
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:29,212
Anyway, I... Do you even
know where Codswall is?

303
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,553
Of course.

304
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:34,219
It's one of the bigger...

305
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:36,455
Smaller fingering islands.

306
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:39,226
Fingerling. Exactly. Fingerling.

307
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:41,699
Thank you, Your Majesty.

308
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,032
For? Confirming my suspicion

309
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,265
that you've never had
consideration for us.

310
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:50,834
This makes my decision to sell our
beets to West Loria that much easier.

311
00:16:51,878 --> 00:16:55,815
Where the fuck is West Loria?
West of Loria, Your Majesty.

312
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:57,783
But since when?
While you were Janet,

313
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:02,311
King Idri and his sister Ru,
had a squabble/slight war.

314
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:06,084
Like a civil war? And
as acting High King,

315
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,753
I asked myself, "What
would Margo or Eliot do?"

316
00:17:08,828 --> 00:17:12,265
Support our ally, Idri.
Unfortunately, he lost.

317
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:16,325
Now Queen Ru
rules over West Loria.

318
00:17:16,402 --> 00:17:20,635
And 'cause she's pissed we helped Idri,
she wants all Lady Pike's fresh beets?

319
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,504
Damn. That's cold.

320
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:25,272
Verily, they don't even have
talking animals in West Loria.

321
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,336
One problem at a time.

322
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:30,042
The Cumdumpsterson twat...
- Codswall.

323
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:31,550
Oh, I know what I said.

324
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,051
I'm going to firebomb the shit

325
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,281
out of her floating patch
of dirt and take her beets.

326
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,118
Bada-bing, bada-fuck her.

327
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:40,284
Could we be a tad
less incendiary?

328
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,793
Agreed.

329
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:44,524
What would Eliot do?

330
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:48,895
Eliot's not here, sweetie.

331
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,367
I am.

332
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:58,566
So, just to ask this,

333
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:02,012
can we really risk
war with West Loria?

334
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,448
Diplomacy was
Eliot's thing, Josh.

335
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:06,145
Diplomacy is what
got you elected.

336
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,983
I got elected because I
listened to a drunk bear

337
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:10,546
talk about his fee-fees.

338
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:14,287
That's all diplomacy
is! It was an accident.

339
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:18,527
I don't know how to intentionally
care about other people's shit.

340
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:21,532
Lucky for you, that's all I do.

341
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,337
Fine.

342
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,499
One shot, Hoberman.

343
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:41,287
Hi, we're looking for Stoppard.

344
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:45,949
Daniel, honey.

345
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:50,089
Come in before someone sees you.

346
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:52,063
Amazing.

347
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:56,000
I haven't seen anything like this
since before the exclusion laws.

348
00:18:57,036 --> 00:18:58,197
I have one of these!

349
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,205
And it's missing
a spoke like mine.

350
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:01,968
What are the odds?

351
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,601
Anyway, this one, it
didn't come with a manual.

352
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:06,543
Do you have any ideas?

353
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,410
Well, it's hard to
explain, but I think...

354
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,006
Daniel, something's not...

355
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:13,685
Mom? Mom, what's wrong?

356
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:16,588
Something's wrong
with the spells.

357
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:19,023
Hold on, I'll figure this out.

358
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:20,457
Quickly, while he's busy.

359
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:31,996
Found an outdated copy of
Taussig's <i>Primer</i> and a VCR manual.

360
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:35,302
This place has shit
for helpful books.

361
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,502
Well, at least it's standing.

362
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:39,738
I cannot believe a
bunch of militant muggles

363
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:41,838
beat me to burning
down Brakebills.

364
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:45,216
What's that? Oh. It was Sonia's.

365
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:48,855
You mean Stoppard's
mother? I mean Sonia Kikuno,

366
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:52,255
the genius who basically
pioneered horomancy.

367
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:55,123
This is easily one of the most
accidentally valuable things

368
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,321
I've ever stolen.

369
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:57,488
Here, look.

370
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:00,429
Wasn't that in
Stoppard's workshop?

371
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:03,936
Yeah. That screen
opens a window in time.

372
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:06,768
You can FaceTime with the
past as far back as 50 years.

373
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:09,274
It's genuinely
genius. Like, wow.

374
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:11,401
A lot of these
spells use cinnabar.

375
00:20:11,477 --> 00:20:13,105
Hasn't that stuff been
banned for years?

376
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:16,616
Yeah, it causes severe
neuro-degeneration,

377
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,776
which is probably what's
happening with Sonia.

378
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:20,683
She's been hitting the cinnabar

379
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:23,120
pretty hard for
decades, I imagine.

380
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:25,124
So,

381
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:27,626
she has clockwork Alzheimer's?

382
00:20:28,294 --> 00:20:31,355
Hmm, kind of, but so much worse.

383
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,331
Your brain gets unstuck in time.

384
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,163
You don't know where
you are or when you are,

385
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,135
and you can't control it.

386
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:40,799
It is good, good
times, and then you die.

387
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:43,502
Yeah, but it seemed
like they had a treatment.

388
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,102
I mean, those weird
watches she had on?

389
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:49,313
Mmm, yeah, until
they got messed up

390
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:50,849
by us.

391
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,981
Must be what started all this.

392
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:55,044
I mean, back in timeline 40...

393
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:57,352
It's why Stoppard
hunted us down.

394
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:58,721
He's trying to save his mom.

395
00:20:58,791 --> 00:20:59,986
Oh.

396
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,391
Now I almost feel bad for him.

397
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,655
No, feel bad for us.

398
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:04,788
Even if we get
back to timeline 40,

399
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:07,333
Stoppard is going to do
anything he can to kick us out.

400
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:08,890
Unless we kill him.

401
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:11,733
For trying to save his mom?

402
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:14,364
Moms die every
day. Circle of life.

403
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:17,509
Wow. No!

404
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,607
We help him save her.

405
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:36,160
Am I just absorbing a
fuck-ton of cinnabar right now?

406
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,964
Yeah, and breathing it.

407
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:41,826
Great.

408
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:45,194
Let's finish this and
get the hell out of here.

409
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,713
Sonia? <i>Who are you?</i>

410
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:01,845
Friends of Daniel,
who's grown now.

411
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:04,013
Listen, we need to talk to you

412
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:05,667
about that cinnabar
that you're using. It's...

413
00:22:05,691 --> 00:22:08,456
<i>Frying my brain into
cheesecloth, I know.</i>

414
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:12,330
<i>Daniel used my designs to
build the device you're using.</i>

415
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:15,131
<i>We talked a couple months ago.</i>

416
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:18,638
<i>If you were his
friends, you'd know that.</i>

417
00:22:18,704 --> 00:22:20,536
He asked you to stop?

418
00:22:20,606 --> 00:22:22,131
<i>Of course.</i>

419
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,575
<i>He also told me I'm about
to have a breakthrough</i>

420
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:26,544
<i>that creates a
whole new discipline.</i>

421
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:29,411
<i>I can't stop now. My
work's too important.</i>

422
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:30,915
Fair point.

423
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:32,315
So you're just going to pick

424
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:34,182
your clock shit
over your own kid?

425
00:22:35,588 --> 00:22:38,683
<i>No, idiot. I choose both.</i>

426
00:22:38,757 --> 00:22:41,192
<i>I designed devices to
counter the cinnabar,</i>

427
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:44,286
<i>tether my mind right here
with my work and my kid.</i>

428
00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:49,033
<i>As long as I have these
working for me, I'll be fine.</i>

429
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:51,763
<i>I intend to die
a very old lady...</i>

430
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,897
<i>Sharp as a tack.</i>

431
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:58,600
Fuck her. It's not our fault.

432
00:22:58,677 --> 00:23:00,989
She knew the consequences,
and she still licked her paintbrushes.

433
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:03,278
We go back to 40, we're
taking the kid's mom away.

434
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:04,942
I'm not doing that.
Well, I'm not losing

435
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:06,952
my life because some
horo-bitch is a shitty mom.

436
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:08,749
She's shitty so
he should suffer?

437
00:23:09,355 --> 00:23:11,551
We're the ones who don't belong.

438
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:14,184
You know what? You do you.

439
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:19,556
I'm going back to 40
and my future wife.

440
00:23:19,632 --> 00:23:21,533
Don't touch me!

441
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,366
Shit.

442
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:36,171
Okay.

443
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,439
Quick.

444
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:51,621
Anything? Nothing yet.

445
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:53,063
Keep looking.

446
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:56,696
Quentin.

447
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,736
Whoopsies.

448
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:03,302
Are you drunk?

449
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:06,874
This body hearts tequila

450
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,505
when I'm happy, when I'm sad,

451
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,641
when I'm bored because
everything is taking too long,

452
00:24:11,717 --> 00:24:13,413
meaning you.

453
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:14,976
Relevant story.

454
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:16,249
I was in a road,

455
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:20,726
and I almost got hit by, what
do you call it, a big fat truck.

456
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,955
But I wouldn't have
felt anything at all

457
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,826
because tequila is my friend.

458
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:29,032
Um, you know, great news,

459
00:24:29,101 --> 00:24:32,560
we've made good progress
finding that part of yours.

460
00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:34,303
Um...

461
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:36,808
You wouldn't still happen to
have the paper I gave you?

462
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:41,070
Oh... I misplaced it.

463
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,547
Do you know anything about

464
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:46,881
an Egyptian god of yellow fruit?

465
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:50,379
I'm not at all helpful
like this, am I?

466
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:51,549
What do you think?

467
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:56,391
You seem stressed by your
vast and obvious limitations.

468
00:24:56,462 --> 00:24:58,102
Why don't we just ask

469
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,392
someone who was there?

470
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:16,107
You know, for having
such desiccated hands,

471
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,013
his Hieratic script's amazing.

472
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:22,987
What did he say?

473
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:27,658
Cut our poor mummy
friend some slack, Hoo-lia.

474
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:29,160
He took a hook to the brain.

475
00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:31,720
Of course, he's got a bit
of a speech impediment.

476
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:33,823
Oh, uh, the yellow fruit.

477
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,198
It's a mandrake root, and
we are looking for Heka,

478
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:40,465
the god of magic and medicine.

479
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,008
It looks like he's got
one of your stones.

480
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:44,600
Let's go kill him.

481
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:47,840
He's already dead.

482
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:52,516
Looks like he was
buried in the Temple of...

483
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:53,779
Uh...

484
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:55,252
Esna?

485
00:25:56,388 --> 00:26:00,348
Uh, which was
looted shortly after.

486
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,689
And where is it now? My loot?

487
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,727
Yes, this is very disappointing.

488
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,136
Figure this out
before I get mad.

489
00:26:12,204 --> 00:26:15,868
This body craves
a cinnamon churro.

490
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:21,605
Um...

491
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:27,842
Bye.

492
00:26:45,971 --> 00:26:47,997
We can take a break.
No, no, it's okay.

493
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:49,405
I want to keep going.

494
00:26:51,577 --> 00:26:53,705
It bothers you, doesn't
it? That I'm so into this?

495
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,680
It just worries me.

496
00:26:55,747 --> 00:26:59,343
For you, magic, you think
it just can fix everything,

497
00:26:59,418 --> 00:27:01,614
but it kind of has a
way of breaking things.

498
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:04,214
Sometimes I feel like
everything that's gone wrong

499
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:06,816
in my life is 'cause of it.

500
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:12,830
Yeah, I used to say the same about
alcohol, about drugs, about money,

501
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:15,026
but none of that's
really good or bad.

502
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,968
It just is. It's how
you handle it, really.

503
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:21,039
Don't drink that. The
tap's got lead in it.

504
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:23,371
You got to drink the bottled
water out of the fridge.

505
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:26,571
Why is there lead in
the tap? City's pipes.

506
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,307
They're old and corroded.

507
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:30,575
Why don't they just fix it?

508
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,811
That's cute, that
you think they would.

509
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:44,023
Asekian's Purification.

510
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:45,826
I can show you. It's simple.

511
00:27:49,301 --> 00:27:52,465
Can you do that for the
rest of the water supply?

512
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:56,041
No, or better yet, is there
a spell that would restore

513
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:59,272
all the old pipes in
Modesto? There is, but...

514
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,471
Okay, well, then do that.

515
00:28:00,546 --> 00:28:01,809
Do it, please,

516
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,320
because you have no idea how
many people, how many kids are...

517
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:06,613
No, it's too big.
We can't do it.

518
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,245
There's not enough
ambient magic.

519
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:11,847
The Library, it
doles out the rest?

520
00:28:14,893 --> 00:28:16,418
Wait.

521
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:19,954
You said that they
control the levels

522
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,766
of ambient magic that flow
through the pipes, right?

523
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:26,031
Yeah?

524
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:27,903
I can feel one.

525
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,974
They're everywhere.

526
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,510
No, no, no.

527
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,344
I think this one's different.

528
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:39,751
This one has a leak.

529
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:45,624
This isn't just food, Margo.

530
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:47,557
This is your secret weapon.

531
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:50,357
You can tell a lot about
people based on what they eat.

532
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:55,329
Everything looks
lovely. Thank you.

533
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,029
Our chef is very... Talented.

534
00:28:58,103 --> 00:28:59,628
Extra.

535
00:28:59,705 --> 00:29:01,503
I'll take that as a compliment.

536
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,634
Like I was saying, is she
reserved, adventurous?

537
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:07,305
Maybe she's sexy and decadent

538
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:10,440
like a truffle lobster
mac and cheese.

539
00:29:11,183 --> 00:29:12,981
Oh, interesting.

540
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:16,510
Mongoose cream egg
with caviar. She's bold.

541
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,752
Proud of her accomplishments,
but being so driven

542
00:29:19,825 --> 00:29:23,193
has led her to be
lonely, misunderstood.

543
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:27,199
Mmm. Tick said something
about Codswall's polite alpacas.

544
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,167
Maybe she's proud of that. Ask.

545
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:33,762
I hear Codswall has
upstanding alpacas.

546
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:38,136
It is a misconception that
alpacas have behavioral issues.

547
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:42,306
The truth is, they have a lack of
self-esteem from years of shearing.

548
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:45,476
Imagine being stripped naked
twice, even three times a year.

549
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:48,451
There it is. She's
real into her 'pacas.

550
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:52,253
Empathize with her.
The indignity is real.

551
00:29:52,758 --> 00:29:56,092
Like humans,
alpacas need affection

552
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,153
and love. Preach.

553
00:29:58,497 --> 00:29:59,760
You may not know this,

554
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:02,858
but I ran on a platform
of animal equality.

555
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:04,698
My administration is the first

556
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:07,330
to give talking animals
their rightful voice.

557
00:30:08,206 --> 00:30:11,040
I mean, that is why
we're here tonight, right?

558
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:12,771
The animals.

559
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:16,303
I just care so damn much.

560
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:22,114
I like to drink my tea with
a splash of alpaca milk.

561
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:28,988
Would you like some?

562
00:30:29,061 --> 00:30:31,587
Uh, you can't
refuse this, Margo.

563
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,462
It's straight from my
dearest Delilah's teat.

564
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:42,707
Uh-huh.

565
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:48,974
Do it, Margo.

566
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,641
Now!

567
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,720
Yeah, good.

568
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:01,251
You are a champion.

569
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:03,522
You can really taste the love.

570
00:31:04,663 --> 00:31:07,633
What a beautiful way to say it.

571
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,935
I'm afraid I may have judged
Your Majesty too quickly.

572
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:13,767
Same.

573
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:17,606
Which is why I would love
it if we could start fresh.

574
00:31:17,676 --> 00:31:18,700
Your beets...

575
00:31:18,777 --> 00:31:20,643
Unfortunately, I
have already agreed

576
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,442
to sell my beets to West Loria,

577
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:24,642
and being a woman of my word,

578
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,207
I can't go back.

579
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:28,316
You understand, right?

580
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:33,020
I'm going to check on dessert.

581
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:34,787
I'm about to skin a bitch.

582
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,125
I want you to double
down on the charm offense.

583
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:40,632
You got her eating out of your
extra-diplomatic hands right now.

584
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:43,533
I guess I could lube her up
some more about her alpacas.

585
00:31:43,602 --> 00:31:47,266
Yes, exactly. You, High
King Margo fucking Hanson,

586
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:48,830
you got this.

587
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,637
I know you didn't
think you could do this,

588
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:53,611
but, honestly, I think
you're out-Elioting Eliot.

589
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:58,179
Oh! Strawberry ricotta soufflé
is done. I'm gonna get that.

590
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,776
You get back to
winning at High King-in'.

591
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:08,522
Margo, what are you
doing? Being the real me.

592
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,653
Let me tell you how this
is going to play out, lady.

593
00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:12,493
You're going to
give me those beets,

594
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:13,775
and I'm not going
to skin and eat

595
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:16,325
any of your tasty
alpaca children, <i>capisce?</i>

596
00:32:18,403 --> 00:32:19,962
That's what I thought.

597
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:34,946
What in the hell?

598
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:39,221
Hi.

599
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:41,385
I can't begin to imagine

600
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,453
how you fucked yourself
hard enough to get here, but...

601
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:47,998
let's take advantage.

602
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:51,259
Interesting choice on the hair.

603
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:53,396
Says the guy dressed
like an ambulance chaser.

604
00:32:54,906 --> 00:32:58,035
So you're dead me. Technically.

605
00:32:58,109 --> 00:32:59,509
Does this mean I'm dead, too?

606
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:04,045
No, no, this is a, uh,
kind of between space?

607
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:06,311
I saw you zapped
yourself here like an idiot,

608
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:08,376
and I took a coffee break.

609
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:10,718
I mean, I've been
wanting to talk to you.

610
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:12,333
So then I assume you
know that I took your...

611
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:15,521
You took my spot
in my timeline? Yeah.

612
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,895
Didn't expect that
twist with Julia, though.

613
00:33:17,963 --> 00:33:19,659
Yeah, I could say
the same about Kady.

614
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:26,728
For what it's worth, it never
felt right taking your place.

615
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:28,467
But, you know...
Everything feels wrong,

616
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:31,339
so you just pick something?
Yeah, of course I do.

617
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:32,775
Real talk...

618
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:35,375
You gotta go back.

619
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:37,006
To 23, I know,
I'm working on it.

620
00:33:37,082 --> 00:33:39,347
Uh, no. My timeline.

621
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:41,351
It's where you belong.

622
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:43,012
Okay, do you want
to cut the vague,

623
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:45,420
omniscient Librarian
shit and just tell me why?

624
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:48,122
It's complicated but crucial.

625
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:49,855
You do know me existing there

626
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:53,125
is making some very important
horomancer lady very sick?

627
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:55,525
It's doing a lot more than that.

628
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:59,093
Look, I know you lost everyone
you love in timeline 23...

629
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,536
Really?

630
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:03,097
But they're still
alive in timeline 40,

631
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:05,575
and if I were you, which I am,

632
00:34:05,644 --> 00:34:08,170
I'd do whatever to
not lose them again.

633
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:11,512
Okay, you might be me,

634
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:14,178
but you don't know me, okay?

635
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:15,686
Those shits are not my people.

636
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:19,521
Fair, but I know a
little about your future.

637
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:20,786
Perks of the gig.

638
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:23,090
So is being an abstruse
dick about it, apparently.

639
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:24,956
Sonia can't be saved.

640
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,522
Even if you go back to 23,
she's dead within a month.

641
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,794
It's terminal. Period.

642
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:32,847
Sounds like something I'd say to
make myself feel like less of an ass.

643
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:35,033
Bigger things at play
than your guilt, buddy.

644
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:36,438
You got to go back. Sorry.

645
00:34:36,508 --> 00:34:38,170
That's as specific as I can be.

646
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,474
Sorry? Are you?

647
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:44,277
Dude, I just jumped you clear
over 1,000 miles of bullshit.

648
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:48,549
So I'm sorry if it feels
bad in your soft little heart,

649
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:51,419
but, more importantly,
you're welcome.

650
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:54,590
But Kady wants you.

651
00:34:55,961 --> 00:34:57,452
They all want you.

652
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,130
It's not my timeline anymore.

653
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:04,635
It's yours.

654
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:09,974
So, you remember that
when the moment comes,

655
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:11,270
I said, "Do it."

656
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:13,836
Do what he says, okay?

657
00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:16,177
No, not okay. Vague as shit.

658
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:19,927
To go back to 40,
you're gonna want to

659
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,579
turn this dial three
clicks to the right.

660
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:25,686
Tell Kady I love her,

661
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:27,982
and I'm sorry.

662
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:37,433
Well, thank Christ. I thought
you pissed off without me.

663
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:39,733
Where'd you go? It was, uh...

664
00:35:40,772 --> 00:35:42,673
I honestly don't
know how to explain it.

665
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:45,768
But I know what
we got to do now.

666
00:35:53,218 --> 00:35:54,686
It's here.

667
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,384
Oh, God.

668
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,259
You were right, there's a crack.

669
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,266
I think it could split the pipe
open and let more ambient out.

670
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:09,858
Here.

671
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,621
Once you pour it down the drain,

672
00:36:53,645 --> 00:36:54,855
it should clean
the water... Okay.

673
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,643
And clear the
corrosion from the pipes.

674
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:08,821
Did I do something wrong?

675
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,020
Huh?

676
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,185
No, I just...

677
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:14,357
I can't remember the last time
that magic wasn't the problem.

678
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:17,835
This calls for a drink.

679
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:27,844
Thank you.

680
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,750
Look, we'll find
the stone. It'll be...

681
00:37:47,465 --> 00:37:48,694
What are you doing?

682
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:54,470
Stop.

683
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:56,906
Jesus.

684
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:05,507
Those pills can kill you.

685
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,518
I'll take a new body. I'm bored.

686
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:11,784
You kill Eliot, and you can
forget about us helping you.

687
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:17,158
Eliot, Eliot, Eliot.

688
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:22,132
Why do you care
about him so much?

689
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,465
Because I do.

690
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:26,664
You kill him, and we are done.

691
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:30,271
I swear to God, I am serious.

692
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:32,173
I will abandon you,

693
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:35,145
and I will die trying to
burn you to the ground.

694
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:42,951
That's cute.

695
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:46,988
But I'm strong...

696
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:50,625
And you're weak.

697
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:52,163
Break my bones,

698
00:38:53,798 --> 00:38:55,892
and strangle me.

699
00:38:57,902 --> 00:38:59,097
Too tired to care anymore.

700
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,763
Q.

701
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:04,939
You hurt him, you
take one more pill,

702
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,205
and you can build
your body on your own.

703
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,617
Fine.

704
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:16,712
I'll take better care
of the meat suit.

705
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:23,290
But you don't have to
be such a baby about it.

706
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:34,572
Hey, what happened
with the game plan?

707
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,540
Margo, are you okay?

708
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:46,609
You stupid, stupid prick.

709
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:50,121
How dare you say
I out-Elioted Eliot?

710
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:51,781
Tell me. Hmm?

711
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:54,690
Why would I ever want to
do anything without him?

712
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:57,354
Hey, I'm sorry.

713
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:59,226
I should have known
how you were feeling.

714
00:39:59,297 --> 00:40:02,529
Why? Because I like
fettuccine and I hate rosé,

715
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,795
you think you know me?

716
00:40:03,868 --> 00:40:05,302
You don't, Hoberman.

717
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:07,339
Because if you
did, you would know

718
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,306
I don't need a new
partner-in-crime.

719
00:40:09,374 --> 00:40:12,139
That's not... I was
just trying to help you.

720
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,210
Bullshit.

721
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,473
Now, I may be a
cunt, but I am real.

722
00:40:17,548 --> 00:40:20,313
You? You're just a
brown-nose sweater boy

723
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:23,787
desperate to matter
at all to anyone.

724
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:25,923
Wow.

725
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:28,994
And here I thought I was being

726
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,688
a friend who wants
to be your boyfriend.

727
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:34,127
I really, really got to
work on the signals.

728
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,665
Josh, I didn't... You
didn't mean to hurt me?

729
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:39,863
Yes, you did.

730
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:42,305
Believe it or not, I know
exactly who you are, Margo.

731
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:55,951
Took you long enough.

732
00:40:57,388 --> 00:40:58,947
I nearly gave up on
you making it back.

733
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:02,192
Yeah, well, magic was a
little scarce in your timeline,

734
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,695
so it took a minute to rebuild.

735
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:07,129
Where's Marina?
With her girlfriend.

736
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:11,528
Listen, kid, we know you're
trying to look out for your mom.

737
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:12,695
We get it.

738
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,238
You saying you'll leave?

739
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,803
Bigger things at play here.

740
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,073
Sorry, man. I'm
not going anywhere.

741
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:26,944
Is that... Yeah.

742
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:32,348
It's from another timeline.
Please. Don't blow on it.

743
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:33,618
If you blow on it...

744
00:41:33,691 --> 00:41:35,626
It'll spread seeds everywhere,

745
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:39,325
root itself in this timeline, making
it impossible for you to clean?

746
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:41,763
I know,

747
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:44,359
which is why I scattered
about 10 of them an hour ago.

748
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:49,501
I'm sorry.

749
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:00,617
Hey!

750
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:04,814
What are you waiting
for? It's clean! It got fixed!

751
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:06,380
I'm serious!

752
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:09,389
Come on, don't waste it!

753
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,493
Whoo!

754
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:16,866
You can go on
ahead if you want to.

755
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:18,630
I'll meet you back at the house.

756
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:20,001
You sure?

757
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:23,041
Yeah, I'm gonna stick
around a little while.

758
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,871
All right, I'll see you later.

759
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:38,621
Thanks for calling me. I
knew you'd want to know.

760
00:42:38,689 --> 00:42:41,454
I owe you. Nah.

761
00:42:41,526 --> 00:42:42,858
This is for all of us.

762
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:16,653
Sheila Cozener?

763
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:18,286
You've been a busy girl.
