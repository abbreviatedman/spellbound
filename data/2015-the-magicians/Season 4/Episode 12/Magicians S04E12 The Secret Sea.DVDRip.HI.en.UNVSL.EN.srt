A huge reservoir of magic,
hidden underneath the castle?

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,142
Where does it lead? To
Roderick's secret chamber?

THE BINDER: The
Binder had a theory.

5
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:14,076
When a being of great
power, such as a god, is killed,

6
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,274
their energy is lost.

7
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,841
But he believed it
could be preserved,

8
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:20,318
effectively turning the
magician into a god.

didn't think I'd get through.

To do what?

20
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:44,504
To become a god.

21
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:47,047
It's locked. Don't
you have the key?

22
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:48,308
Someone locked us in.

23
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:49,975

180
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,482
Don't say "fry" and "fish."

181
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:45,219
It's not working. He's
not getting better.

182
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:48,557
Margo, please. For Josh?

183
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,527
Damn it.

184
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,693
So I just look at him? (EXHALES)

185
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,701
My Gods.

186
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:02,333
He perked right up.

187
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:03,672
(CHUCKLES)

188
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,911
He's bonded to you.

189
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,580
He thinks you're his mother.

190
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,016
Unfortunately, that's not
the first time that's happened.

191
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,519
Closest thing to the
reservoir in the books

192
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:17,818
is the Secret Sea.

193
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,553
It's an underground ocean.

194
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,059
Chatwins sailed across it

195
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:24,563
with a crew full
of rabbit pirates.

196
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:26,657
Are those pirates
who steal rabbits,

197
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:27,928
or pirates who are rabbits?

198
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,034
Kind of both.

199
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,162
But it doesn't say anything

200
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,071
about the Secret Sea
being full of magic or cursed,

201
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,974
so maybe there's a
clue that I'm missing.

202
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,706
And if your nerdy
bullshit leads us nowhere?

203
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:40,906
We need a backup plan.

204
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:43,813
Speaking of bunnies, where
are the ones that Fen sent?

205
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,249
I have an idea.

206
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,981
So do all rabbits talk, or...

207
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,183
Some of them you have
to bribe with cigarettes first.

208
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,725
Look, about my message...

209
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,283
No, I know. I owe you.

210
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:55,885
But I can't slip you

211
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,022
that kind of power
behind The Order's back.

212
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,862
The monsters have
two of my friends,

213
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,402
and who knows what kind
of chaos they're causing

214
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:03,960
while the Library does nothing.

215
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,265
Look, Alice...

216
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:09,164
I am no stranger to
messing up a good thing.

217
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,074
I'm not gonna do
that with the Library.

218
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:15,240
Well, if we don't do something,
there might not be a Library anymore.

219
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:16,613
Then why don't you work with us?

220
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:19,413
Because your bosses
would arrest all of us on sight.

221
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:20,818
You wanna do some good?

222
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,786
This is your best chance.

223
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,454
I hope you find
what you need, Alice.

224
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:32,718
We're not setting him loose.

225
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,826
All we're promising is to take
him with us if we find an exit.

226
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,062
Well?

227
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,106
Do we have a deal?

228
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,438
Moss?

229
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:49,574
My theory is it
counteracts the poison.

230
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,584
Probably why it's the
only other living thing

231
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,142
in this place.

232
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:56,013
(CHUCKLES) Been
eating it since I got here

233
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,681
and I'm as healthy as a horse.

234
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,055
How did you get here?

235
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:02,625
Former prisoner of yours,

236
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:04,755
Alice Quinn,

237
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,699
seemed to think this was
the place I deserved to be.

238
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,530
I can't say I disagree.

239
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:12,504
Don't bite the hand
that feeds you, dear.

240
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,172
Shall we?

241
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,517
Huh.

242
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,951
At least give me my dignity.

243
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,752
Sorry. Protocol.

244
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,588
Well, this was a new suit.

245
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:36,824
It's a bit loud.

246
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:38,831
Yes.

247
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,134
It certainly is.

248
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,030
(CHUCKLES)

249
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,088
Damn, the history of this
place is depressing as shit.

250
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,522
Most world histories are.

251
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,218
Nothing about a way out.

252
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:10,227
Kady?

253
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,255
Oh, shit.

254
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,259
PLOVER: What?

255
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:18,668
The moss should have
protected you from...

256
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:23,200
Oh. "Oh," what?

257
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,779
The age-suspension spells

258
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:28,712
Martin used to keep me
alive while he tortured me,

259
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:30,875
it must still be
keeping me alive.

260
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,077
Perfect.

261
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:35,121
So I'm gonna die in the
most ironic way possible.

262
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:36,951
Just like Penny.

263
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,757
Well...

264
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,388
Not necessarily.

265
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:45,424
If we get back in time...

266
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,801
Wait,

267
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:49,935
(SCOFFS)

268
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:52,336
all this time

269
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,603
the Library had a cure?

270
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,801
Kady... No, you...

271
00:12:56,909 --> 00:13:00,437
you chose not to save Penny?

272
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,379
If it were up to me... It was.

273
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,246
It's called "The Poison Room."

274
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:06,411
The name is a warning
Penny chose to ignore.

275
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:09,115
No, no, no, you don't get
to hide behind the Library.

276
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:11,953
You think if you're a
cog in a fascist machine

277
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:15,018
that you're not responsible
for the people that it kills?

278
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,528
I'll admit, the Library veered

279
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,098
in an authoritarian direction.

280
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,862
Because of Everett. Once
we remove him from power...

281
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,664
No, no, it is not just Everett.

282
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,932
It's the whole goddamn Order.

283
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,474
It all needs to be burned down.

284
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,873
Not if it can be reformed.

285
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,970
Look, as someone
who lived through

286
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35,743
two world wars, I can tell you,

287
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,011
authoritarian regimes,
they fail eventually.

288
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:39,117
See?

289
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:40,362
Look, even the
pedophile agrees with me.

290
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,287
Oh, hardly.

291
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:45,251
(SCOFFS) Problem is,

292
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,851
no one will ever let you change.

293
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,657
People always see you
for what you've done,

294
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,254
never for who you are.

295
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,062
So at the end of the day,

296
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,344
no matter what
you try to become,

297
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:56,961
some judgmental blonde bitch

298
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:59,130
always shoves you
down a poison well.

299
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:00,969
Yeah?

300
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,809
Well, then I'm
Team Blonde Bitch.

301
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,586
Where's Fen? I sent
her out for fish flakes

302
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,155
three hours ago.

303
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:19,021
Wait, you sent her out
alone in Manhattan?

304
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:22,085
Well, I kind of implied it
was her fault Josh was a fish

305
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,528
and blah, blah, blah,
I'd blame her forever,

306
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,326
so she's cooling
off at Benihana.

307
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,527
She never could
resist a sharp knife.

308
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,630
Meanwhile, I'm trying to
read up on a damn cure

309
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,904
while maintaining constant
eye contact with an anchovy.

310
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,111
And they say girls are
the ones who get needy

311
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,510
once you fuck them.

312
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,373
Wait, were you and Josh...

313
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:44,507
Wait, you know about

314
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:47,247
the werewolf stuff, right?

315
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,046
Who gives a shit?

316
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,021
Nothing matters. Okay.

317
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,559
Look, it's not a
big deal, all right?

318
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,727
Sometimes we bang.
He makes me laugh.

319
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,320
And I like having him around

320
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,957
'cause of the
aforementioned banging,

321
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,161
and he just you know, he
kind of gets me. So what?

322
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,637
It's not like I'm in love
with Josh Hoberman.

323
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,969
It kinda sounds
like you are, though.

324
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:12,075
Have you met me?
I don't do feelings.

325
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:15,375
I'm the bitch with the ice axes.

326
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,383
You can still care about a guy,

327
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,352
werewolf, fish.

328
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,889
And it doesn't make
you any less you.

329
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,584
I mean, you can still
be a bitch if you want to.

330
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:28,420
Hmm. Shit.

331
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:32,927
Maybe I do love
this goddamn guppy.

332
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:37,501
Uh, I think this is
the Hedge doctor

333
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,231
that Kady called to fix Pete.

334
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,637
Says he's a veterinarian.

335
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,606
Maybe he can help
with the fish-Josh.

336
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,006
Josh-fish.

337
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,443

339
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,947
Yeah, I've got fish problems.

um...

345
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:17,369
I didn't think that I could
ever trust you again.

346

And now...

00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,681

When we first met,

352
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:46,468
I was clinging onto some

353
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:51,474
naive, idealistic notions of
what the world should be.

How people should be.

if I just throw away
all that childish bullshit,

537
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:56,275
Did you know that
centaurs view necrophilia

538
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:58,407
as a way of honoring the dead?

539
00:26:58,584 --> 00:27:00,280
Don't think I'd get
a Carnegie Medal

540
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:02,253
for explaining that to children.

541
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:06,691
I mean, then there's all the
exaggerations and the lies.

542
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:10,596
I mean, Martin slaying
a dozen mercenaries,

543
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:15,124
and Jane riding on top of
a horse, what, 100 feet tall?

544
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:17,260
I mean, what did she
call it? Cozy Horse.

545
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:20,932
(CHUCKLING) "Cozy Horse."
Utter nonsense thrown in there

546
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:23,566
just to see how much
they'd get me to believe,

547
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,634
and then Jane
insisted I keep it.

548
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:29,044
In real life, the ending
was much darker.

549
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:31,947
Oh, Martin did stop the
Watcher Woman, that's true.

550
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:34,077
The Secret Sea

551
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,588
was built by the
thirteenth king of Fillory

552
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,749
to consolidate
power for himself.

553
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:42,027
Martin wanted to make
sure that no one ever tried

554
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:46,121
to do the same thing again
so he drained the Secret Sea

555
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:49,168
using the last few
drops to set a trap

556
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:52,170
for anyone who might,
one day, try to refill it.

557
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:53,705
A curse.

558
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:56,531
Right, so now, one
of our friends is a fish.

559
00:27:56,642 --> 00:27:59,544
(CHUCKLES) Well,
he was 13 at the time.

560
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:03,309
You have to forgive his rather
adolescent sense of humor.

561
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:04,441
You know how to fix it?

562
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,550
Mmm.

563
00:28:05,651 --> 00:28:08,143
There's a garden just
outside the reservoir.

564
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,985
The Drowned
Garden, Martin called it.

565
00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:12,791
Never did know why.

566
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,685
It reacts to your emotions.

567
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,024
You feel happy, a flower blooms.

568
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:21,362
You feel sad, another one.

569
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,664
So, one of the
plants is the antidote?

570
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:25,163
Indeed.

571
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:29,233
To make it bloom,

572
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:32,072
you have to truly love Fillory.

573
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:39,915
Maybe when I was 12, but...

574
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:44,553
I don't know, Fillory's taken
away a lot of the shit I love.

575
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:46,852
Martin had the same problem.

576
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,194
He returned as an adult

577
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:52,356
and could not make
the flower bloom.

578
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:55,866
His innocent love for Fillory

579
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:58,699
had soured.

580
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,671

recent experiences,

585
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,649
Quentin has the
best chance of...

586
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:19,050
making the garden grow.

we were made for.

It's not that I am terrified

00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:21,380
Don't.

717
00:35:22,988 --> 00:35:24,479
I don't want you to.

718
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:28,188
Believing in something,
really believing,

719
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:30,228
is almost impossible.

720
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:34,624
But the Quentin I first met...

721
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,296
he believed in magic.

722
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:39,931
And in Fillory.

723
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:42,233
He changed.

724
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,405
He grew up.

725
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:48,570
Being an adult doesn't mean
that you have to throw away

726
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:50,115
what you used to love.

727
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:52,845
Then what does it mean?

728
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,280
Seeing the world
through new eyes.

729
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:04,860
And for what it's worth,

730
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:06,826
the Cozy Horse is real.

731
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:08,332
I saw her when I was a Niffin.

732
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,795
So big you could
build a house on it.

733
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:13,933

734
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,708

737

You know the worst part

738
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:43,063
of getting exactly
what you want?

739
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:48,572
When it's not good enough.

740
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:53,173
Then what do you do?

741
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,482
If this can't make me
happy, then what would?

742
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:06,354
Fillory was supposed
to mean something.

743
00:37:07,826 --> 00:37:11,160
I was supposed to
mean something here.

744
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:15,465
But it's all... It's
just... It's random.

745
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:18,503
It's so random that the
only way to save my friends

746
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,869
is to yell at a fucking plant!

747
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:28,244
Honestly, fuck Fillory
for being so disappointing.

748
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:31,821
You know what,
maybe I was better off

749
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,876
just believing
that it was fiction.

750
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:37,948
The idea of Fillory

751
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:40,082
is what saved my life!

Find an escape.

760
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,317
There has gotta be
some power in that.

761
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:19,898

this is gonna work?
