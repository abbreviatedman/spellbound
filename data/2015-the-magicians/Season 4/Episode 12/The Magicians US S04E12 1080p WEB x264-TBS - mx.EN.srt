00:00:06,838 --> 00:00:08,468
<i>Previously,
on</i> "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:08,501 --> 00:00:11,757
A huge reservoir of magic
hidden underneath the castle?

3
00:00:12,146 --> 00:00:15,122
- Where does it lead?
- To Roderick's secret chamber?

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,731
The Binder had a theory.

5
00:00:16,819 --> 00:00:19,981
When a being of great power
such as a God is killed,

6
00:00:20,069 --> 00:00:21,442
their energy is lost.

7
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,747
But he believed
it could be preserved,

8
00:00:23,835 --> 00:00:26,372
effectively turning
the magician into a God.

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,654
Oh, thank Christ.
I didn't think I'd get through.

10
00:00:28,742 --> 00:00:30,421
Listen, I don't have
a lot of time.

11
00:00:30,509 --> 00:00:31,565
We need your help.

12
00:00:31,652 --> 00:00:33,130
Surviving
first year students,

13
00:00:33,218 --> 00:00:35,981
I am here to teach you
what not to do.

14
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:38,502
The Library, they don't
want you to know it.

15
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:39,645
Before we go in,

16
00:00:39,732 --> 00:00:41,675
there's a small matter
of protection.

17
00:00:41,762 --> 00:00:42,997
- What is it?
- Insects.

18
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:45,974
The bugs only last an hour,
so we need to be quick.

19
00:00:46,062 --> 00:00:47,593
Everett's been lying
to all of us.

20
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:48,850
To do what?

21
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,595
To become a God.

22
00:00:50,897 --> 00:00:52,851
- It's locked.
- Don't you have the key?

23
00:00:52,943 --> 00:00:54,106
Someone locked us in.

24
00:00:54,194 --> 00:00:55,810
- Who's dying?
- My sister.

25
00:00:55,898 --> 00:00:59,364
I found her a body,
but I need to find one

26
00:00:59,452 --> 00:01:01,685
that is more durable.

27
00:01:01,772 --> 00:01:03,874
Like yours.

28
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:18,124
No running away,
little not-God.

29
00:01:18,317 --> 00:01:21,452
I'd hate to damage
my sister's new body.

30
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:24,882
♪ Good news, sister ♪

31
00:01:25,314 --> 00:01:26,754
I have found you

32
00:01:26,968 --> 00:01:30,192
a much more durable body.

33
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,786
But I am going to have

34
00:01:31,874 --> 00:01:34,429
to momentarily kill you again.

35
00:01:34,732 --> 00:01:36,312
Shh, shh.

36
00:01:38,882 --> 00:01:41,991
I beseech you,
Our Lady Underground...

37
00:01:46,676 --> 00:01:48,171
You know what, fuck this.

38
00:01:48,355 --> 00:01:49,675
You said you chose me,

39
00:01:49,763 --> 00:01:51,530
so now's your chance
to prove it.

40
00:01:51,765 --> 00:01:54,499
Julia.

41
00:01:59,353 --> 00:02:01,530
Kinda cutting it close,
don't you think?

42
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:03,531
I didn't come here to fix it.

43
00:02:03,702 --> 00:02:04,825
I can't.

44
00:02:04,913 --> 00:02:06,280
You still have a chance.

45
00:02:06,368 --> 00:02:08,224
A choice
of what you want to be.

46
00:02:08,312 --> 00:02:11,966
You're saying this whole time
me being a human and a God,

47
00:02:12,054 --> 00:02:13,851
this was all just a test?

48
00:02:14,752 --> 00:02:17,616
Well, both options are shit.

49
00:02:17,757 --> 00:02:21,036
I mean, you're... you're saying
one is pass and one is fail?

50
00:02:21,124 --> 00:02:23,928
You will not fail as long
as the decision is yours.

51
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:26,843
Now go!
I can only hold him for so long!

52
00:02:26,931 --> 00:02:28,234
Oh, shit.

53
00:02:28,322 --> 00:02:29,591
Run!

56
00:02:56,202 --> 00:02:58,625
- Jesus Christ.
- So the monster took Julia.

57
00:02:58,712 --> 00:03:00,833
- We need to find them.
- Do something now.

58
00:03:00,921 --> 00:03:02,352
We have the axes
and the demon bottles,

59
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:04,124
you have the incorporate bond.

60
00:03:04,632 --> 00:03:06,427
You didn't give two wet shits

61
00:03:06,515 --> 00:03:08,169
when it was Eliot's life
on the line,

62
00:03:08,257 --> 00:03:10,663
and now that it's Julia
you're suddenly leaning in?

63
00:03:10,751 --> 00:03:12,554
Look, we all care
about both of them,

64
00:03:12,642 --> 00:03:14,640
but based on
Mayakovsky's formula

65
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,890
casting an incorporate bond
strong enough to hold a God

66
00:03:16,978 --> 00:03:18,968
would take an insane amount
of power.

67
00:03:19,171 --> 00:03:20,302
No, we'd need twice as much.

68
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,122
If we go in there
without enough juice

69
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,665
they'll... they'll just body hop.

70
00:03:23,752 --> 00:03:25,937
- They'll kill us all.
- Great.

71
00:03:26,691 --> 00:03:29,327
Where the hell are we gonna
find that kind of magic?

72
00:03:30,093 --> 00:03:31,665
Hey, Dean.

73
00:03:31,752 --> 00:03:34,569
I would not go in your office
right now, if I were you.

74
00:03:34,722 --> 00:03:37,028
If you shit
in my private bathroom again...

75
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,788
No, well, see,
there's kind of

76
00:03:38,876 --> 00:03:41,437
a few Librarian dudes here
to arrest you.

77
00:03:41,525 --> 00:03:44,664
Yeah, they're pretty pissed
about some lecture you gave

78
00:03:44,752 --> 00:03:47,075
while you were pissed.

79
00:03:47,163 --> 00:03:48,460
I've been expecting them.

80
00:03:48,732 --> 00:03:50,124
Come with me.

81
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,665
Thank Christ I wore
the right suit today.

82
00:03:55,765 --> 00:03:58,695
The right suit
for being arrested, or...?

83
00:03:59,874 --> 00:04:01,171
Wait...

84
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:02,388
Are you still drunk?

85
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:04,273
That's entirely
beside the point.

86
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:05,523
We have a bigger problem.

87
00:04:05,611 --> 00:04:07,895
Kady and Zelda haven't
returned from the Poison Room,

88
00:04:07,983 --> 00:04:09,294
and they're running out
of time.

89
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,327
Oh, shit.

90
00:04:12,023 --> 00:04:13,705
Who are they, and what does
that mean, exactly?

91
00:04:13,792 --> 00:04:16,226
- God damn it, focus, Todd.
- Yes.

92
00:04:16,314 --> 00:04:17,912
If I'm going to be arrested,
there still maybe be a chance

93
00:04:17,999 --> 00:04:19,350
that something good
can come from it.

94
00:04:19,437 --> 00:04:20,547
Here.

95
00:04:24,704 --> 00:04:25,725
Yes, here.

96
00:04:25,812 --> 00:04:27,770
Take this to the
Library book club immediately.

97
00:04:27,858 --> 00:04:29,067
Tell no one,
do you understand?

98
00:04:29,155 --> 00:04:31,637
Sure, keep it "confidench."
On it.

99
00:04:31,725 --> 00:04:33,835
And try not
to "Todd" this up.

100
00:04:34,762 --> 00:04:37,280
I will try not to be myself.

101
00:04:50,453 --> 00:04:53,054
Well, so much
for getting Fogg's help.

102
00:05:02,023 --> 00:05:04,745
Well, that's the last
of our protection.

103
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:07,795
On the upside...

104
00:05:08,077 --> 00:05:09,476
tasted minty fresh.

105
00:05:10,974 --> 00:05:12,505
Let's go.

106
00:05:15,851 --> 00:05:17,108
Wait.

107
00:05:18,015 --> 00:05:19,671
What the hell?

108
00:05:30,457 --> 00:05:31,702
Hello, there.

109
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,165
Apologies, I was trying
not to startle you.

110
00:05:34,536 --> 00:05:36,759
- Christopher Plover.
- Pleasure.

111
00:05:37,009 --> 00:05:38,685
The children's book author?

112
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:41,092
Oh, you're familiar
with my work.

113
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,296
You could say that.

114
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,256
I've read
Martin Chatwin's book.

115
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,649
Yes, well, not exactly
the highlight of my oath.

116
00:05:46,737 --> 00:05:50,274
Oh, you're the pervert
who turned him into The Beast.

117
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,719
And the man who survived
in this place for weeks.

118
00:05:54,445 --> 00:05:56,085
And I can show you how...

119
00:05:56,313 --> 00:05:59,032
if you help me escape.

120
00:06:03,161 --> 00:06:05,080
Look, it sucks
that Fogg's out of "comish,"

121
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:06,767
but who else can we shake down?

122
00:06:06,994 --> 00:06:08,859
Kady was trying to find
the Library stockpile.

123
00:06:08,947 --> 00:06:10,572
If we knew where that was...

124
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,583
Found magic, need help!

125
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:13,845
Who sent you?

126
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:16,392
- Found magic, need help!
- Okay, where?

127
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,353
- Vague as shit.
- Oh, sorry.

128
00:06:18,508 --> 00:06:20,150
It's Fen.

129
00:06:24,087 --> 00:06:25,267
Right this way.

130
00:06:25,563 --> 00:06:27,526
High King Fen awaits.

131
00:06:41,722 --> 00:06:43,705
Whoa.

132
00:06:50,763 --> 00:06:52,956
Sort of incredible.

133
00:06:54,224 --> 00:06:56,066
Trippy.

134
00:06:56,154 --> 00:06:58,003
Oh, good, you're here.

135
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:00,058
Fen, what is this?

136
00:07:00,264 --> 00:07:01,800
And what's with the fish?

137
00:07:01,965 --> 00:07:03,917
Follow me, come on.

138
00:07:11,461 --> 00:07:13,706
Holy shit.

139
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,284
This is the reservoir?

140
00:07:16,372 --> 00:07:18,135
Ocean of pure magic.

141
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,464
Pretty amazing, right?

142
00:07:20,713 --> 00:07:21,775
I found it.

143
00:07:21,863 --> 00:07:22,907
Well, Josh and me.

144
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:24,249
And Tik was there too,
I guess.

145
00:07:24,337 --> 00:07:25,979
But, no, a lot of it was me.

146
00:07:27,722 --> 00:07:30,239
One small problem...

147
00:07:30,327 --> 00:07:31,425
Don't touch it!

148
00:07:31,513 --> 00:07:33,386
That's the tiny little problem.

149
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:36,909
It seems to be protected
by some sort of curse.

150
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:39,831
Look what it did to Josh.

151
00:07:40,274 --> 00:07:42,566
You're saying Josh
is a fucking fish?

152
00:07:42,654 --> 00:07:43,878
Well, of course not.

153
00:07:43,966 --> 00:07:45,519
He's a Fillorian Dying Fish.

154
00:07:45,622 --> 00:07:49,128
A Fillorian Fucking Fish
is a totally different species.

155
00:07:49,254 --> 00:07:51,089
Wait, "Dying Fish"?

156
00:07:51,177 --> 00:07:53,130
I really hope
that's a metaphor.

157
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:56,386
Nope, they only live
a couple days.

158
00:07:56,474 --> 00:07:58,176
And you're sure that's Josh?

159
00:07:58,264 --> 00:07:59,620
Oh, I saw it happen.

160
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,651
We were gonna come
straight to you guys,

161
00:08:01,739 --> 00:08:03,984
tell you all about
how we saved the day,

162
00:08:04,072 --> 00:08:08,015
and then he touches the water
and next thing I know, boom.

163
00:08:08,274 --> 00:08:09,542
Josh Fish.

164
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,113
Him and his damn showmanship.

165
00:08:13,274 --> 00:08:14,730
So is it bad
if it turns white?

166
00:08:14,818 --> 00:08:16,722
Great Umber's taint.

167
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,236
What are you doing?

168
00:08:18,324 --> 00:08:20,675
Dying Fish need eye contact,

169
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,347
almost constantly.

170
00:08:22,453 --> 00:08:24,111
Usually they get it
from their fish moms,

171
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:26,132
but we'll have to fill in.

172
00:08:26,274 --> 00:08:29,769
Every pet I ever had ended up
in a shoebox or the toilet.

173
00:08:29,857 --> 00:08:30,918
This one's all you.

174
00:08:31,006 --> 00:08:32,314
It's just until we figure out

175
00:08:32,402 --> 00:08:34,011
how to turn him back
into a person.

176
00:08:34,173 --> 00:08:35,544
Or the rest of his life.

177
00:08:35,632 --> 00:08:37,316
I'm not babysitting Nemo

178
00:08:37,404 --> 00:08:39,557
when we're this close
to saving Eliot.

179
00:08:40,181 --> 00:08:41,550
I've got bigger fish to fry.

180
00:08:41,638 --> 00:08:43,386
Shh, Margo!

181
00:08:43,697 --> 00:08:46,199
Don't say "fry" and "fish."

182
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,131
It's not working.
He's not getting better.

183
00:08:52,219 --> 00:08:53,972
Margo, please.

184
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,964
For Josh?

185
00:08:56,315 --> 00:08:58,328
Damn it.

186
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:01,972
So I just look at him?

187
00:09:06,116 --> 00:09:07,503
My Gods.

188
00:09:07,868 --> 00:09:09,316
He perked right up.

189
00:09:11,745 --> 00:09:13,620
He's bonded to you.

190
00:09:14,894 --> 00:09:16,769
He thinks you're his mother.

191
00:09:17,834 --> 00:09:21,136
Unfortunately, that's not
the first time it's happened.

192
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,433
Closest thing to the reservoir
in the books

193
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,917
is the Secret Sea.

194
00:09:25,094 --> 00:09:26,456
It's an underground ocean.

195
00:09:26,544 --> 00:09:28,189
Chatwins sailed across it

196
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:31,581
with a crew
full of rabbit pirates.

197
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:33,464
Are those pirates
who steal rabbits,

198
00:09:33,552 --> 00:09:35,186
or pirates who are rabbits?

199
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:36,305
Kind of both.

200
00:09:36,393 --> 00:09:38,172
But it doesn't say anything

201
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,266
about the Secret Sea
being full of magic or cursed,

202
00:09:41,354 --> 00:09:44,141
so I... maybe there's a clue
that I'm missing.

203
00:09:44,229 --> 00:09:46,322
And if your nerdy bullshit
leads us nowhere?

204
00:09:46,862 --> 00:09:48,118
We need a back-up plan.

205
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,127
Speaking of bunnies,

206
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:50,813
where are the ones
that Fen sent?

207
00:09:50,994 --> 00:09:52,352
I have an idea.

208
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,204
So do all rabbits talk,
or...?

209
00:09:55,747 --> 00:09:58,250
Some of them you have
to bribe with cigarettes first.

210
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,735
Look, about my message...

211
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,530
- No, I know.
- I owe you.

212
00:10:01,618 --> 00:10:03,813
But I can't slip you
that kind of power

213
00:10:03,901 --> 00:10:04,991
behind the Order's back.

214
00:10:05,118 --> 00:10:06,704
The monsters have
two of my friends,

215
00:10:06,792 --> 00:10:09,344
and who knows what kind
of chaos they're causing

216
00:10:09,432 --> 00:10:10,909
while the Library does nothing.

217
00:10:10,997 --> 00:10:12,477
Look, Alice...

218
00:10:12,705 --> 00:10:16,266
I am not stranger
to messing up a good thing.

219
00:10:16,634 --> 00:10:19,039
I'm not gonna do that
with the Library.

220
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,557
Well, if we don't
do something,

221
00:10:20,644 --> 00:10:22,196
there might not be
a Library anymore.

222
00:10:22,284 --> 00:10:23,527
Then why don't you
work with us?

223
00:10:23,614 --> 00:10:26,391
Because your bosses would
arrest all of us on sight.

224
00:10:26,487 --> 00:10:27,626
You wanna do some good?

225
00:10:27,714 --> 00:10:29,711
This is your best chance.

226
00:10:31,774 --> 00:10:34,172
I hope you find
what you need, Alice.

227
00:10:38,249 --> 00:10:39,639
We're not setting him loose.

228
00:10:39,727 --> 00:10:41,298
All we're promising
is to take him with us

229
00:10:41,385 --> 00:10:42,780
if we find an exit.

230
00:10:42,868 --> 00:10:44,024
Well?

231
00:10:44,257 --> 00:10:46,370
Do we have a deal?

232
00:10:52,463 --> 00:10:53,625
Moss?

233
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:56,532
My theory
is it counteracts the poison.

234
00:10:56,744 --> 00:10:58,633
Probably why it's
the only other living thing

235
00:10:58,721 --> 00:11:00,055
in this place.

236
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,122
Been eating it since I got here

237
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,920
and I'm as healthy as a horse.

238
00:11:05,008 --> 00:11:06,993
How did you get here?

239
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:09,677
Former prisoner of yours,

240
00:11:09,764 --> 00:11:11,422
Alice Quinn...

241
00:11:11,784 --> 00:11:14,697
seemed to think this was
the place I deserved to be.

242
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:16,713
I can't say I disagree.

243
00:11:16,932 --> 00:11:19,447
Don't bite the hand
that feeds you, dear.

244
00:11:19,774 --> 00:11:21,268
Shall we?

245
00:11:32,745 --> 00:11:35,057
At least give me my dignity.

246
00:11:35,145 --> 00:11:36,422
Sorry.

247
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,603
Protocol.

248
00:11:37,804 --> 00:11:41,594
Well, this was a new suit.

249
00:11:42,097 --> 00:11:43,260
It's a bit loud.

250
00:11:43,824 --> 00:11:46,527
Yes.

251
00:11:46,614 --> 00:11:48,333
It certainly is.

252
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:10,983
Damn, the history of this
place is depressing as shit.

253
00:12:11,071 --> 00:12:13,399
Most world histories are.

254
00:12:14,407 --> 00:12:16,028
Nothing about a way out.

255
00:12:16,696 --> 00:12:18,098
Kady?

256
00:12:18,797 --> 00:12:20,098
Oh, shit.

257
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,055
What?

258
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:26,556
The moss should have
protected you from...

259
00:12:28,071 --> 00:12:29,422
Oh.

260
00:12:29,657 --> 00:12:31,141
"Oh," what?

261
00:12:31,781 --> 00:12:33,990
The age-suspensions spells

262
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:36,875
Martin used to keep me alive
while he tortured me...

263
00:12:36,963 --> 00:12:38,737
It must still be
keeping me alive.

264
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:39,912
Perfect.

265
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,928
So I'm gonna die in the most
ironic way possible.

266
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,710
Just like Penny.

267
00:12:45,774 --> 00:12:47,258
Well...

268
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,118
not necessarily.

269
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:53,245
If we get back in time...

270
00:12:55,352 --> 00:12:56,758
Wait...

271
00:12:58,119 --> 00:13:00,071
All this time...

272
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,436
the Library had a cure?

273
00:13:02,524 --> 00:13:04,709
- Kady...
- No, you...

274
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,427
you chose...

275
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,308
not to save Penny?

276
00:13:08,396 --> 00:13:10,318
- If it were up to me...
- It was.

277
00:13:10,406 --> 00:13:12,089
It's called
"The Poison Room."

278
00:13:12,177 --> 00:13:14,501
The name is a warning
Penny chose to ignore.

279
00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:17,305
No, no, no, you don't get
to hide behind the Library.

280
00:13:17,393 --> 00:13:19,907
You think if you're a cog
in a fascist machine

281
00:13:19,995 --> 00:13:22,977
that you're not responsible
for the people that it kills?

282
00:13:23,065 --> 00:13:24,352
I'll admit,
he Library veered

283
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,928
in an authoritarian direction.

284
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,611
Because of Everett.

285
00:13:28,699 --> 00:13:30,042
Once we remove
him from power...

286
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:31,720
No, no, it is not
just Everett.

287
00:13:31,808 --> 00:13:33,832
It's the whole god damn Order.

288
00:13:34,277 --> 00:13:36,371
It all needs
to be burned down.

289
00:13:36,847 --> 00:13:38,746
Not if it can be reformed.

290
00:13:38,964 --> 00:13:42,095
Look, as... as someone
who lived through

291
00:13:42,183 --> 00:13:43,915
two world wars, I can tell you,

292
00:13:44,003 --> 00:13:46,353
authoritarian regimes,
they fail eventually.

293
00:13:46,441 --> 00:13:48,464
See? Look, even the
pedophile agrees with me.

294
00:13:48,552 --> 00:13:50,495
Oh, hardly.

295
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,785
Problem is...

296
00:13:53,485 --> 00:13:55,578
no one will ever
let you change.

297
00:13:55,806 --> 00:13:58,599
People always see you
for what you've done,

298
00:13:58,686 --> 00:14:00,549
never for who you are.

299
00:14:00,636 --> 00:14:01,844
So at the end of the day,

300
00:14:01,932 --> 00:14:03,165
no matter what you try
to become,

301
00:14:03,252 --> 00:14:04,641
some judgmental blonde bitch

302
00:14:04,729 --> 00:14:07,010
always shoves you down
a poison well.

303
00:14:07,142 --> 00:14:08,698
Yeah?

304
00:14:10,515 --> 00:14:12,598
Well, then I'm
Team Blonde Bitch.

305
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,150
Where's Fen?

306
00:14:21,238 --> 00:14:22,579
I sent her out
for fish flakes

307
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:24,509
three hours ago.

308
00:14:24,596 --> 00:14:27,033
Wait, you sent her out alone
in Manhattan?

309
00:14:27,135 --> 00:14:28,297
Well, I kind of implied

310
00:14:28,385 --> 00:14:30,416
it was her fault
Josh was a fish

311
00:14:30,504 --> 00:14:32,628
and blah, blah, blah,
I'd blame her forever,

312
00:14:32,716 --> 00:14:34,900
so she's cooling off
at Benihana.

313
00:14:35,838 --> 00:14:38,781
She never could resist
a sharp knife.

314
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:41,581
Meanwhile, I'm trying
to read up on a damn cure

315
00:14:41,675 --> 00:14:43,274
while maintaining
constant eye contact

316
00:14:43,362 --> 00:14:45,295
with an anchovy.

317
00:14:45,383 --> 00:14:47,188
And they say girls
are the ones who get needy

318
00:14:47,276 --> 00:14:49,169
once you fuck them.

319
00:14:49,328 --> 00:14:51,509
Wait... wait, you and Josh...

320
00:14:51,596 --> 00:14:53,047
Wait, you know about

321
00:14:53,242 --> 00:14:55,313
the little
werewolf stuff, right?

322
00:14:55,401 --> 00:14:57,039
Who gives a shit?

323
00:14:57,127 --> 00:14:59,030
- Nothing matters.
- Okay.

324
00:14:59,118 --> 00:15:01,191
Look, it's not
a big deal, all right?

325
00:15:01,781 --> 00:15:03,479
Sometimes we bang.

326
00:15:03,566 --> 00:15:04,711
He makes me laugh.

327
00:15:04,844 --> 00:15:06,422
And I like having him around

328
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,178
'cause of the
aforementioned banging,

329
00:15:08,266 --> 00:15:09,579
and he just... you know,
he kind of gets me.

330
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,194
So what?

331
00:15:11,282 --> 00:15:13,506
It's not like I'm in love
with Josh Hoberman.

332
00:15:13,675 --> 00:15:16,389
It kinda sounds
like you are, though.

333
00:15:16,626 --> 00:15:18,177
Have you met me?

334
00:15:18,436 --> 00:15:20,295
I don't do feelings.

335
00:15:21,263 --> 00:15:23,201
I'm the bitch
with the ice axes.

336
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,452
Well, you can still
care about a guy...

337
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:28,264
Werewolf, fish...

338
00:15:28,515 --> 00:15:30,942
And it doesn't make you
any less you.

339
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,176
I mean, you can still be
a bitch if you want to.

340
00:15:34,847 --> 00:15:36,387
Shit.

341
00:15:38,334 --> 00:15:41,082
Maybe I do love
this goddamn guppy.

342
00:15:41,957 --> 00:15:45,137
Uh, I think this is
the Hedge doctor

343
00:15:45,241 --> 00:15:47,064
that Kady called
to fix Pete.

344
00:15:47,152 --> 00:15:48,402
Says he's a veterinarian.

345
00:15:48,576 --> 00:15:50,791
Maybe he can help
with the fish-Josh.

346
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:52,012
Josh-fish.

347
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:54,666
Way to be useful, Coldwater.

348
00:15:57,861 --> 00:15:59,295
Is this Gordy?

349
00:15:59,428 --> 00:16:02,026
Yeah, I've got fish problems.

350
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,210
- Josh and Margo.
- Yeah.

351
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,469
Okay, here's my thing:

352
00:16:19,556 --> 00:16:21,288
Um...

353
00:16:22,936 --> 00:16:25,897
I didn't think that I could
ever trust you again.

354
00:16:27,696 --> 00:16:29,733
And now...

355
00:16:30,309 --> 00:16:31,975
"And now"?

356
00:16:32,567 --> 00:16:35,304
I find myself wanting to.

357
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,323
When we first met...

358
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:54,710
I was clinging onto some...

359
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:59,250
naive, idealistic notions
of what the world should be.

360
00:17:00,531 --> 00:17:02,640
How people should be.

361
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:07,214
And I think
that I have realized...

362
00:17:08,936 --> 00:17:12,694
If I just throw away
all that childish bullshit,

363
00:17:13,388 --> 00:17:16,225
I can forgive people...

364
00:17:18,142 --> 00:17:22,155
For not living up
to my stupid expectations.

365
00:17:23,115 --> 00:17:24,835
Like yourself?

366
00:17:31,155 --> 00:17:33,315
What if we tried again?

367
00:17:34,994 --> 00:17:37,771
I want you in my life, Alice.

368
00:17:38,943 --> 00:17:40,810
I want that, too.

369
00:17:52,732 --> 00:17:55,357
Cyrus.

370
00:17:55,686 --> 00:17:58,380
There was an intrusion
in the Poison Room.

371
00:17:58,686 --> 00:18:00,412
It's Zelda.

372
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:03,068
With a hedge witch.

373
00:18:04,736 --> 00:18:06,120
Did you follow protocol?

374
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,544
Yes, they're locked in.

375
00:18:09,235 --> 00:18:12,021
But do we really just
leave her to die in there?

376
00:18:22,254 --> 00:18:24,227
How long do you think we have?

377
00:18:24,509 --> 00:18:25,863
If we got out now?

378
00:18:25,951 --> 00:18:27,591
A few days.

379
00:18:28,879 --> 00:18:30,521
In here?

380
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,576
A few hours.

381
00:18:32,978 --> 00:18:35,981
The after-effects of the bugs
slowed the...

382
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:37,437
Zelda?

383
00:18:37,525 --> 00:18:39,125
Shit.

384
00:18:48,144 --> 00:18:50,273
Sorry to knock you out
like that.

385
00:18:50,685 --> 00:18:52,758
It's the only way
we could talk.

386
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,655
You could have freed me.

387
00:19:03,985 --> 00:19:05,394
You brought a hedge witch

388
00:19:05,482 --> 00:19:07,365
into our
most protected archive.

389
00:19:07,467 --> 00:19:08,957
I read your book.

390
00:19:09,053 --> 00:19:10,264
You're hoarding magic.

391
00:19:10,391 --> 00:19:11,638
Trying to become a God.

392
00:19:11,726 --> 00:19:13,051
Why?

393
00:19:13,139 --> 00:19:14,499
I put in centuries of work

394
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,559
before you ever knew
the Library existed.

395
00:19:16,646 --> 00:19:18,539
Oh, so I wouldn't understand.

396
00:19:18,626 --> 00:19:19,811
No, you should understand.

397
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:20,942
How...

398
00:19:22,157 --> 00:19:23,897
Futile it all is.

399
00:19:23,991 --> 00:19:27,035
We work so hard to protect
the flame of knowledge,

400
00:19:27,123 --> 00:19:30,139
but there will always be things
we can't understand.

401
00:19:30,264 --> 00:19:31,678
Knowledge of the Gods.

402
00:19:31,766 --> 00:19:32,871
By becoming one of them,

403
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:34,840
I can rip their secrets away
from them

404
00:19:34,928 --> 00:19:36,902
and bring them back
to the Library.

405
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,373
At what cost?

406
00:19:38,461 --> 00:19:41,344
An unkillable God
is on the loose as we speak.

407
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,350
In the body of Eliot Waugh.

408
00:19:44,656 --> 00:19:46,074
You intend to take his power.

409
00:19:46,162 --> 00:19:48,912
He has the power
to destroy everything,

410
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:50,628
and all we have are books.

411
00:19:50,716 --> 00:19:52,420
If we want to face
that kind of threat,

412
00:19:52,508 --> 00:19:54,131
we need power too.

413
00:20:08,623 --> 00:20:09,623
Isn't that what Bacchus

414
00:20:09,711 --> 00:20:11,012
and the others
were trying to do?

415
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,679
They got drunk
on their own power.

416
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:13,972
Some of them literally.

417
00:20:14,069 --> 00:20:15,676
What makes you think
you won't fall prey

418
00:20:15,764 --> 00:20:16,871
to the same hubris?

419
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:18,897
Well, I thought I had you.

420
00:20:25,021 --> 00:20:27,186
Excuse me,
but isn't this book banned?

421
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,717
Like, really, really banned?

422
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:31,262
Fuck me.

423
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,607
Uh, we need to get that
to the Poison Room.

424
00:20:33,695 --> 00:20:34,849
Immediately.

425
00:20:34,937 --> 00:20:36,818
Now, now, now.

426
00:21:09,349 --> 00:21:10,749
You wanted me...

427
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:15,263
To do what, exactly?

428
00:21:15,372 --> 00:21:17,802
To take over the Library
once I'm gone.

429
00:21:18,029 --> 00:21:20,583
To see to the human concerns,

430
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:23,013
and to fix my mistakes

431
00:21:23,354 --> 00:21:24,847
with the benefit
of all the knowledge

432
00:21:24,935 --> 00:21:26,678
and the power I would bring.

433
00:21:26,989 --> 00:21:29,255
I wish you'd told me
the truth sooner.

434
00:21:29,616 --> 00:21:31,106
So do I.

435
00:21:31,747 --> 00:21:32,850
So...

436
00:21:33,278 --> 00:21:34,778
do what you must.

437
00:21:36,239 --> 00:21:37,458
Follow protocol.

438
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,809
There is a way
you can still help me.

439
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,497
I redirected the power I need
into a reservoir,

440
00:21:43,696 --> 00:21:45,639
but it triggered
a protective spell.

441
00:21:45,726 --> 00:21:47,284
A puzzle I can't solve.

442
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:49,323
But I've discovered
someone who can.

443
00:21:49,411 --> 00:21:50,973
Quentin Coldwater.

444
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:54,026
Get Quentin to open
the reservoir,

445
00:21:54,114 --> 00:21:56,096
and the Library can still be
yours to lead if...

446
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,122
Did you slap me?

447
00:22:00,231 --> 00:22:02,192
We need to move, fast.

448
00:22:02,736 --> 00:22:04,088
No.

449
00:22:04,176 --> 00:22:06,127
I didn't risk my life
to save a child molester.

450
00:22:06,215 --> 00:22:07,609
- He can stay.
- What?

451
00:22:07,696 --> 00:22:09,380
No!

452
00:22:09,468 --> 00:22:11,539
We had a deal!
Tell him!

453
00:22:11,856 --> 00:22:14,619
Well, your moss
didn't do shit for us, so...

454
00:22:14,706 --> 00:22:18,051
But, uh... but I can help you
get to the reservoir.

455
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:22,098
It... it was a secret
of Martin's, and...

456
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,543
I know all his secrets.

457
00:22:24,685 --> 00:22:26,817
I could share them with you.

458
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,137
- Incursion protocol.
- They're patrolling.

459
00:22:37,426 --> 00:22:39,028
Come on.

460
00:22:44,153 --> 00:22:46,042
Get to the earth fountain,
I'll hold them off.

461
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,880
Go!

462
00:22:57,796 --> 00:22:59,034
Damn it.

463
00:22:59,145 --> 00:23:01,067
Quite a trip you sent me on.

464
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:05,699
You ruined my suit.

465
00:23:06,106 --> 00:23:07,575
But the good news is...

466
00:23:09,043 --> 00:23:10,778
you're just about my size.

467
00:23:18,301 --> 00:23:20,386
Keep barking, you Schnauzer fuck.

468
00:23:20,474 --> 00:23:22,294
It won't bring back
your balls.

469
00:23:22,699 --> 00:23:24,802
God, I hate animals.

470
00:23:25,716 --> 00:23:27,270
So...

471
00:23:28,036 --> 00:23:29,159
goldfish troubles?

472
00:23:29,247 --> 00:23:30,763
Not exactly.

473
00:23:32,575 --> 00:23:33,958
I see.

474
00:23:34,107 --> 00:23:35,440
Not a goldfish.

475
00:23:35,528 --> 00:23:36,716
Some kind of hybrid?

476
00:23:36,911 --> 00:23:38,151
Oh, my God.

477
00:23:38,724 --> 00:23:40,800
I am sorry to be
the bearer of bad news,

478
00:23:40,888 --> 00:23:43,958
but your fish is a werewolf.

479
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:46,189
Wait.

480
00:23:46,276 --> 00:23:47,802
So are you.

481
00:23:48,146 --> 00:23:51,333
Did... did you fuck this fish?

482
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,925
Look, he's a human
who's been cursed,

483
00:23:54,013 --> 00:23:55,628
and I need to know
how to undo it.

484
00:23:55,716 --> 00:23:58,179
Well, it's definitely not
a hedge spell.

485
00:23:58,286 --> 00:23:59,582
And without knowing
how it was cast,

486
00:23:59,669 --> 00:24:01,130
not much I can do about it.

487
00:24:01,218 --> 00:24:03,198
So, should I just go ahead
and flush it, or...

488
00:24:03,286 --> 00:24:05,189
Again, he's a person.

489
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,768
I'm gonna need you to try
a little harder, all right?

490
00:24:07,856 --> 00:24:10,114
Now, if I look away
for literally ten seconds

491
00:24:10,202 --> 00:24:11,152
he starts to die,

492
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,067
and at some point
I'm gonna need to sleep

493
00:24:13,155 --> 00:24:15,974
or drop a deuce,
and I don't allow spectators.

494
00:24:17,406 --> 00:24:19,593
Yeah, there is some kind

495
00:24:19,681 --> 00:24:21,424
of bond happening there.

496
00:24:21,749 --> 00:24:22,897
Whoa.

497
00:24:22,985 --> 00:24:25,562
Your eye is crazy.

498
00:24:25,834 --> 00:24:27,677
Is that a wolf thing, or...

499
00:24:27,809 --> 00:24:29,163
Fairy thing.

500
00:24:29,251 --> 00:24:30,968
Can we focus
on fish boy, please?

501
00:24:31,056 --> 00:24:32,939
It's not even attached
to your head.

502
00:24:33,152 --> 00:24:34,847
You ever pop it out?

503
00:24:34,935 --> 00:24:37,798
Why the shit would I pop out
my own eyeball, Gordy?

504
00:24:38,053 --> 00:24:40,558
So you can point it

505
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:41,744
at your gilled lover

506
00:24:41,832 --> 00:24:44,214
while you attend to...

507
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,761
lady business.

508
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:53,386
I don't know, man.

509
00:24:53,528 --> 00:24:55,464
It feels pretty stuck in there.

510
00:24:56,213 --> 00:24:57,707
Ah!

511
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:03,884
Holy shit, it's working.

512
00:25:03,972 --> 00:25:05,618
I can still see out of it.

513
00:25:05,706 --> 00:25:08,970
You ever touch me again,
I'll pop out your balls.

514
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,446
Uh...

515
00:25:15,888 --> 00:25:18,222
See?

516
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,673
Problem solved.

517
00:25:19,802 --> 00:25:20,977
I don't know.

518
00:25:21,069 --> 00:25:23,641
This seems
kind of problematic.

519
00:25:23,944 --> 00:25:26,894
Oh, I got just the thing.

520
00:25:30,708 --> 00:25:32,181
Really?

521
00:25:33,607 --> 00:25:37,630
Why does a veterinarian have
a pirate-themed eye patch?

522
00:25:37,756 --> 00:25:41,345
Maybe it's best we don't ask
a lot of follow-up questions.

523
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,259
Jesus, what happened to you?

524
00:25:45,347 --> 00:25:46,587
Hey.

525
00:25:48,097 --> 00:25:49,681
- Just...
- Hello, Alice.

526
00:25:49,769 --> 00:25:51,802
- Thought he was dead.
- Why'd you bring him here?

527
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:54,716
Because I just might be
the only person alive

528
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:56,415
who knows how to access
the reservoir

529
00:25:56,503 --> 00:25:58,329
and save your friends.

530
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,493
Mm.

531
00:26:01,581 --> 00:26:03,364
Okay, so the... the reservoir.

532
00:26:03,452 --> 00:26:05,626
Yes, well,
that's what Martin called it.

533
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,087
I thought it lacked

534
00:26:07,175 --> 00:26:09,329
a certain poetry.

535
00:26:09,513 --> 00:26:12,336
So I renamed it
the Secret Sea.

536
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:15,157
Right, the fourth...
The fourth "Fillory" book.

537
00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:17,868
Mm. Oh, I see you
have a copy here.

538
00:26:18,695 --> 00:26:19,608
Ah.

539
00:26:19,696 --> 00:26:22,050
Oh, first edition.

540
00:26:22,138 --> 00:26:24,061
- That must be valuable.
- Yes.

541
00:26:24,454 --> 00:26:25,607
Well...

542
00:26:25,748 --> 00:26:27,621
even more so now.

543
00:26:32,286 --> 00:26:33,823
The Watcherwoman
in the books,

544
00:26:33,911 --> 00:26:36,372
she was...

545
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,472
trying to steal all of magic
for herself, right?

546
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,879
And then...
And then Martin stops her.

547
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:42,948
Most of that book
is pure tosh.

548
00:26:43,036 --> 00:26:45,925
I had to invent that plot
from the whole class.

549
00:26:46,013 --> 00:26:49,823
It's... well, I couldn't exactly
publish the stories

550
00:26:49,911 --> 00:26:51,948
as the children
told them to me, could I?

551
00:26:52,036 --> 00:26:53,487
I mean, the "Flying Forest,"

552
00:26:53,575 --> 00:26:57,333
where the Chatwins discovered
recreational drug use?

553
00:26:57,559 --> 00:27:01,706
Poor little Jane hearing about
the birds and the bees from a...

554
00:27:01,794 --> 00:27:05,096
Did you know that centaurs
view necrophilia

555
00:27:05,184 --> 00:27:07,153
as a way of honoring the dead?

556
00:27:07,241 --> 00:27:09,235
Don't think I'd get
a Carnegie Medal

557
00:27:09,323 --> 00:27:11,419
for explaining that
to children.

558
00:27:11,526 --> 00:27:12,901
I mean, then there's all the...

559
00:27:12,989 --> 00:27:15,342
All the exaggerations
and the lies.

560
00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:19,598
I mean, Martin slaying
a dozen mercenaries,

561
00:27:19,934 --> 00:27:21,745
and Jane riding
on top of a horse,

562
00:27:21,833 --> 00:27:23,854
what, 100 feet tall?

563
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:25,286
I mean, what did she call it?

564
00:27:25,469 --> 00:27:27,532
- Cozy Horse.
- "Cozy Horse."

565
00:27:27,619 --> 00:27:30,020
Utter nonsense
thrown in there

566
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:32,309
just to see how much
they'd get me to believe,

567
00:27:32,469 --> 00:27:34,526
and then Jane insisted
I keep it.

568
00:27:34,614 --> 00:27:37,878
In real life, the ending was...
Was much darker.

569
00:27:37,966 --> 00:27:40,839
Oh, Martin did stop
the Watcherwoman, that's true.

570
00:27:40,927 --> 00:27:43,392
The Secret Sea was built

571
00:27:43,479 --> 00:27:45,382
by the 13th king of Fillory

572
00:27:45,469 --> 00:27:47,768
to consolidate power
for himself.

573
00:27:47,856 --> 00:27:51,322
Martin wanted to make sure
that no one ever tried

574
00:27:51,409 --> 00:27:54,862
to do the same thing again
so he drained the Secret Sea,

575
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,966
using the last few drops
to set a trap

576
00:27:58,059 --> 00:28:00,755
for anyone who might
one day try to refill it.

577
00:28:00,856 --> 00:28:02,823
A... a curse.

578
00:28:02,911 --> 00:28:05,449
Right, so now one
of our friends is a fish.

579
00:28:06,021 --> 00:28:08,184
Well, he was 13 at the time.

580
00:28:08,303 --> 00:28:09,596
You have to forgive

581
00:28:09,684 --> 00:28:12,239
his rather adolescent
sense of humor.

582
00:28:12,327 --> 00:28:14,250
- You know how to fix it?
- Mm-hmm.

583
00:28:14,415 --> 00:28:16,966
There's a garden
just outside the reservoir.

584
00:28:17,054 --> 00:28:19,987
The Drowned Garden,
Martin called it.

585
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:22,106
Never did know why.

586
00:28:22,454 --> 00:28:24,694
It reacts to your emotions.

587
00:28:25,389 --> 00:28:27,725
If you're happy,
a flower blooms.

588
00:28:27,813 --> 00:28:30,016
If you're sad, another one.

589
00:28:30,104 --> 00:28:32,647
So one of the plants
is the antidote?

590
00:28:32,735 --> 00:28:34,211
Indeed.

591
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:37,360
To make it bloom...

592
00:28:38,055 --> 00:28:41,313
you have to truly love Fillory.

593
00:28:46,598 --> 00:28:48,829
Maybe when I was 12, but...

594
00:28:49,946 --> 00:28:52,301
I don't know,
Fillory's taken away

595
00:28:52,389 --> 00:28:53,561
a lot of the shit I love.

596
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,977
Martin had the same problem.

597
00:28:56,459 --> 00:28:58,696
He returned as an adult and...

598
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,500
could not make
the flower bloom.

599
00:29:02,102 --> 00:29:04,821
His innocent love for Fillory

600
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,522
had... had soured.

601
00:29:07,609 --> 00:29:09,682
Think we can all say why.

602
00:29:10,135 --> 00:29:11,510
Quentin.

603
00:29:13,459 --> 00:29:15,432
It has to be you.

604
00:29:16,642 --> 00:29:18,643
I'm familiar with your books.

605
00:29:19,103 --> 00:29:22,143
Even considering
your recent experiences,

606
00:29:22,499 --> 00:29:24,885
Quentin has
the best chance of...

607
00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:27,557
making the garden grow.

608
00:29:32,424 --> 00:29:34,000
We don't have much time.

609
00:29:34,088 --> 00:29:35,753
There's a contractor
the Library uses

610
00:29:35,841 --> 00:29:38,268
- who might be willing to...
- Text me if you find somebody.

611
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:51,140
- So it's true?
- The Library has a cure?

612
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,203
I know, it's bullshit.

613
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:56,776
Go with her
before it's too late.

614
00:29:58,107 --> 00:29:59,961
If this is some noble shit

615
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:02,417
about you not owing
the Library anything...

616
00:30:06,362 --> 00:30:07,446
Oh.

617
00:30:07,534 --> 00:30:08,922
You don't want to be cured.

618
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,182
'Cause for all
of the terrible shit

619
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:14,104
we've been through,
at least the upside

620
00:30:14,192 --> 00:30:16,323
is that you know that
there's a life after death

621
00:30:16,411 --> 00:30:18,957
and you get to spend forever
with the other Penny.

622
00:30:19,358 --> 00:30:21,270
And what part of that
sounds bad?

623
00:30:21,358 --> 00:30:22,989
The part where you're dead.

624
00:30:25,153 --> 00:30:26,815
I may not know you
the way he did,

625
00:30:26,903 --> 00:30:29,536
but I know that that would be
a hell of a waste.

626
00:30:31,408 --> 00:30:32,895
Yeah.

627
00:30:34,004 --> 00:30:35,848
Well, most things are.

628
00:30:41,207 --> 00:30:43,582
A lot's changed
since I've been gone.

629
00:30:43,864 --> 00:30:45,043
Yes.

630
00:30:45,192 --> 00:30:47,592
The humans made
lots of good stuff.

631
00:30:49,241 --> 00:30:51,705
They spend their small lives
building things

632
00:30:51,793 --> 00:30:54,452
that we could smash
in a heartbeat.

633
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:55,766
Sounds fun.

634
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,135
Perhaps you can tell me...

635
00:30:58,223 --> 00:31:00,042
Do I have a name?

636
00:31:01,213 --> 00:31:03,025
Why would you need one?

637
00:31:04,969 --> 00:31:07,025
Starbucks, mostly.

638
00:31:07,429 --> 00:31:09,679
This whole time I felt
so sorry for you.

639
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:11,260
Lost and alone.

640
00:31:11,376 --> 00:31:13,471
But you weren't alone.
You were with the humans.

641
00:31:13,752 --> 00:31:16,432
You talk like them,
you think like them.

642
00:31:18,479 --> 00:31:20,352
I ate a few of them.

643
00:31:20,439 --> 00:31:22,799
Yes, but you care
about them.

644
00:31:31,128 --> 00:31:32,600
You think I'm disappointed.

645
00:31:32,705 --> 00:31:34,267
I'm not.

646
00:31:37,791 --> 00:31:39,892
Are you scared of me,
little brother?

647
00:31:40,239 --> 00:31:42,515
Would I have worked so hard
to bring you back

648
00:31:42,603 --> 00:31:44,205
if I was scared of you?

649
00:31:44,947 --> 00:31:47,181
All I thought about was you.

650
00:31:48,564 --> 00:31:51,228
After I remembered
you existed, anyway.

651
00:31:51,548 --> 00:31:54,110
And all I thought about
was revenge.

652
00:31:54,449 --> 00:31:56,798
And I got it for you already.

653
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,595
I killed Bacchus.

654
00:31:59,946 --> 00:32:01,556
Iris.

655
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:03,603
All of them.

656
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:06,189
Everyone who hurt you.

657
00:32:07,078 --> 00:32:09,211
The question is,
who put us here?

658
00:32:13,315 --> 00:32:14,633
Our parents.

659
00:32:14,985 --> 00:32:17,048
They made us,
called us mistakes.

660
00:32:17,136 --> 00:32:18,284
Abandoned us.

661
00:32:18,372 --> 00:32:21,448
So, what do we do?

662
00:32:21,588 --> 00:32:23,876
I like murder
as much as anyone,

663
00:32:23,964 --> 00:32:26,253
but I did all of this

664
00:32:26,341 --> 00:32:28,314
just to be with you.

665
00:32:28,714 --> 00:32:32,089
Can't we enjoy it
just for a little while?

666
00:32:33,628 --> 00:32:35,704
That's not what we were
made for.

667
00:32:35,792 --> 00:32:39,925
It's not that I am terrified
of the Old Gods in any way.

668
00:32:40,013 --> 00:32:42,493
It's just, how do you kill

669
00:32:42,581 --> 00:32:45,035
an intangible thought creature?

670
00:32:45,395 --> 00:32:47,503
Where do you even stab?

671
00:32:48,604 --> 00:32:50,909
They're more vulnerable
than you think...

672
00:32:51,193 --> 00:32:53,156
If we can get to their realm.

673
00:32:53,469 --> 00:32:55,682
Which we cannot.

674
00:32:55,831 --> 00:32:57,878
- We had a key.
- A scroll.

675
00:32:58,812 --> 00:33:01,544
Found it a very long time ago
on this world.

676
00:33:01,632 --> 00:33:02,672
The Order took it from us.

677
00:33:02,765 --> 00:33:04,632
They didn't even know
what they had.

678
00:33:04,773 --> 00:33:06,101
Now...

679
00:33:06,367 --> 00:33:09,304
where would a bunch
of librarians keep

680
00:33:09,392 --> 00:33:13,664
a very, very important scroll?

681
00:33:27,404 --> 00:33:28,497
Oh.

682
00:33:28,708 --> 00:33:29,755
Here.

683
00:33:30,146 --> 00:33:31,638
This has to be it.

684
00:33:31,818 --> 00:33:34,402
It's exactly
as Martin described it.

685
00:33:34,942 --> 00:33:37,980
Think... think happy thoughts

686
00:33:38,068 --> 00:33:39,382
about Fillory.

687
00:33:39,793 --> 00:33:41,099
Pure.

688
00:33:41,378 --> 00:33:42,943
Innocent.

689
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:45,792
Maybe try talking to it.

690
00:33:45,912 --> 00:33:47,435
Okay, you just...

691
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:54,271
Well...

692
00:33:55,388 --> 00:33:57,943
um, Fillory is...

693
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:00,402
obviously great.

694
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:03,431
Um, you know,
talking bears, right?

695
00:34:03,724 --> 00:34:05,422
Who... who could hate that?

696
00:34:05,888 --> 00:34:09,402
And... and opium in the air.

697
00:34:09,841 --> 00:34:11,392
That was...

698
00:34:11,826 --> 00:34:13,255
smart.

699
00:34:13,662 --> 00:34:15,472
And...

700
00:34:16,247 --> 00:34:18,372
socialized centaur medicine.

701
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:19,738
Are we screwed

702
00:34:19,826 --> 00:34:21,878
because Quentin can't
get it up for Fillory?

703
00:34:21,966 --> 00:34:23,700
- Just...
- Look, why don't you try...

704
00:34:23,788 --> 00:34:24,831
Okay, no, stop.

705
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:26,511
I can't... look, you're the one
that ruined this.

706
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:27,701
I can't do it with you
over my shoulder,

707
00:34:27,788 --> 00:34:29,952
so just... please, just go.

708
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:35,499
God damn it.

709
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:45,402
Okay, um...

710
00:34:45,731 --> 00:34:48,207
when I was a kid
I... I loved the Fizzy River

711
00:34:48,349 --> 00:34:50,012
that they found in book two.

712
00:34:50,349 --> 00:34:52,028
And I loved...

713
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,161
I loved the Upside-Down Desert.

714
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:56,247
You know, the...

715
00:34:56,409 --> 00:34:59,422
I can't really picture it,
but, you know, it sounds...

716
00:34:59,891 --> 00:35:02,811
it sounds cool.

717
00:35:05,409 --> 00:35:07,156
I don't know, I can't...
I'm sorry.

718
00:35:07,244 --> 00:35:09,038
I just... I can't...

719
00:35:09,479 --> 00:35:11,862
Hey. Hey.

720
00:35:11,994 --> 00:35:13,938
I used to love Fillory
when I was a kid

721
00:35:14,026 --> 00:35:16,643
because I didn't know
what it was.

722
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,312
Plover left out
all of the terrible shit,

723
00:35:19,399 --> 00:35:21,158
and most of the good stuff
he just made up.

724
00:35:21,643 --> 00:35:24,432
Even the fucking Cozy Horse
is a lie.

725
00:35:25,025 --> 00:35:26,213
Remember what you told me

726
00:35:26,301 --> 00:35:28,214
about letting go
of who you used to be?

727
00:35:28,338 --> 00:35:30,399
I know, I'm trying.

728
00:35:30,487 --> 00:35:31,916
Don't.

729
00:35:32,884 --> 00:35:34,799
I don't want you to.

730
00:35:35,729 --> 00:35:38,322
Believing in something...
Really believing...

731
00:35:38,409 --> 00:35:40,229
Is almost impossible.

732
00:35:42,458 --> 00:35:44,869
But the Quentin I first met...

733
00:35:45,418 --> 00:35:47,604
he believed in magic.

734
00:35:48,369 --> 00:35:50,283
And in Fillory.

735
00:35:50,612 --> 00:35:52,385
He changed.

736
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:54,877
He grew up.

737
00:35:55,908 --> 00:35:58,799
Being an adult doesn't mean
that you have to throw away

738
00:35:58,887 --> 00:36:00,752
what you used to love.

739
00:36:01,549 --> 00:36:03,307
Then what does it mean?

740
00:36:04,368 --> 00:36:06,971
Seeing the world
through new eyes.

741
00:36:12,349 --> 00:36:14,916
And for what it's worth,

742
00:36:15,572 --> 00:36:17,010
the Cozy Horse is real.

743
00:36:17,143 --> 00:36:18,601
I saw it when I was a niffin.

744
00:36:18,689 --> 00:36:20,807
So big you could
build a house on it.

745
00:36:22,993 --> 00:36:24,483
So...

746
00:36:25,173 --> 00:36:26,815
let's go.

747
00:36:44,947 --> 00:36:47,072
Okay, it's just you and me.

748
00:36:50,096 --> 00:36:51,292
You know the worst part

749
00:36:51,389 --> 00:36:53,416
of getting exactly
what you want?

750
00:36:56,501 --> 00:36:58,385
When it's not good enough.

751
00:37:01,276 --> 00:37:03,080
Then what do you do?

752
00:37:05,987 --> 00:37:08,609
If this can't make me happy,
then what would?

753
00:37:14,088 --> 00:37:16,822
Fillory was supposed
to mean something.

754
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:21,737
I was supposed
to mean something here.

755
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:25,797
But it's all... it's just...
It's random.

756
00:37:25,885 --> 00:37:26,906
It's so random

757
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:28,766
that the only way
to save my friends

758
00:37:28,854 --> 00:37:31,439
is to yell at a fucking plant!

759
00:37:34,916 --> 00:37:37,947
Honestly, fuck Fillory
for being so disappointing.

760
00:37:40,654 --> 00:37:41,907
You know what,
maybe I was better off

761
00:37:41,994 --> 00:37:44,182
just believing
that it was fiction.

762
00:37:46,131 --> 00:37:48,191
The idea of Fillory

763
00:37:48,339 --> 00:37:50,452
is what saved my life!

764
00:37:54,658 --> 00:37:56,861
This promise...

765
00:37:57,979 --> 00:37:59,893
that...

766
00:38:00,767 --> 00:38:02,474
people like me...

767
00:38:05,986 --> 00:38:08,947
People like me...

768
00:38:09,502 --> 00:38:11,361
Can somehow...

769
00:38:15,049 --> 00:38:16,421
Find an escape.

770
00:38:20,189 --> 00:38:22,768
There has gotta be
some power in that.

771
00:38:25,541 --> 00:38:29,854
Shouldn't loving the idea
of Fillory be enough?

772
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,532
Guys.

773
00:39:00,158 --> 00:39:02,869
Guys, something's happening!

774
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:29,432
Here's the door.

775
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:13,974
The key to the realm
of the Old Gods.

776
00:40:44,265 --> 00:40:46,570
How the hell
does this thing work?

777
00:40:49,552 --> 00:40:50,734
Give this to Margo.

778
00:40:50,822 --> 00:40:53,421
If Plover's right,
it should cure Josh.

779
00:40:54,082 --> 00:40:56,271
Monsters in Library!

780
00:41:00,198 --> 00:41:03,061
- Sheila must have sent it.
- Monsters in Library!

781
00:41:03,149 --> 00:41:04,704
All right, we have to go
before they leave.

782
00:41:04,791 --> 00:41:06,376
Okay, I'll grab Margo
and the axes.

783
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,783
Hey, you sure
this is gonna work?

784
00:41:07,871 --> 00:41:08,883
Well, either it will,

785
00:41:08,971 --> 00:41:10,765
or when you come back
we'll both be fish.

786
00:41:10,853 --> 00:41:12,812
Well, that'd be
an improvement.

787
00:41:17,865 --> 00:41:19,828
- Okay.
- Okay.

788
00:41:23,472 --> 00:41:25,007
Do you feel anything?

789
00:41:25,218 --> 00:41:27,007
Super stressed out?

790
00:41:27,567 --> 00:41:29,109
Okay.

791
00:41:32,922 --> 00:41:34,500
Ugh.

792
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:37,809
Yeah, I'm totally feeling that.

793
00:41:37,897 --> 00:41:39,238
Okay.

794
00:41:43,468 --> 00:41:44,372
Grab your axes.

795
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,273
Monsters in the Library.

796
00:41:46,965 --> 00:41:48,312
Are you baking for a fish?

797
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,875
He has a refined palate.

798
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:52,319
Yeah, here, this should fix
the whole fish deal.

799
00:41:52,406 --> 00:41:53,984
And, yes, I noticed

800
00:41:54,072 --> 00:41:55,095
that your eyeball
isn't in your head,

801
00:41:55,183 --> 00:41:56,159
but honestly,
we do not have time

802
00:41:56,246 --> 00:41:56,992
for me to hear that story.

803
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,202
- How long does the leaf take?
- I don't know.

804
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:01,539
But you know it works?

805
00:42:04,047 --> 00:42:05,796
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

806
00:42:05,884 --> 00:42:07,787
but I can't go
until he's cured.

807
00:42:07,929 --> 00:42:09,942
If I leave, Josh will die.

808
00:42:10,107 --> 00:42:12,137
- It's okay.
- Penny.

809
00:42:12,346 --> 00:42:13,469
I'll bring Eliot back.

810
00:42:13,883 --> 00:42:15,289
I promise.

811
00:42:19,856 --> 00:42:21,984
Damn cheap bastards.

812
00:42:22,338 --> 00:42:23,687
No, no, please!

813
00:42:23,775 --> 00:42:25,044
No! No!

814
00:42:26,703 --> 00:42:28,234
Shit.

815
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:39,554
What did you do
to get locked in this cage?

816
00:42:40,785 --> 00:42:42,257
Well, I...

817
00:42:42,976 --> 00:42:45,960
I went against
every instinct I had.

818
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,798
I tried to make
a goddamn difference.

819
00:42:49,194 --> 00:42:52,152
Which, for the record,
you should never, ever do.

820
00:42:55,804 --> 00:42:57,379
Julia...

821
00:42:58,113 --> 00:43:00,558
if... if you're in there,

822
00:43:00,808 --> 00:43:02,768
then I'm sorry...

823
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:06,134
for everything
that happened to you...

824
00:43:07,371 --> 00:43:08,441
Because of me.

825
00:43:08,529 --> 00:43:10,722
Hey, monster.

826
00:43:10,996 --> 00:43:12,340
Lady.

827
00:43:26,054 --> 00:43:27,768
Adorable.

828
