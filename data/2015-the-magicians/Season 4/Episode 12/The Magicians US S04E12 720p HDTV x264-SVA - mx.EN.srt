<i>Previously,
on</i> "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:01,656 --> 00:00:04,710
A huge reservoir of magic
hidden underneath the castle?

3
00:00:05,154 --> 00:00:08,169
- Where does it lead?
- To Roderick's secret chamber?

4
00:00:08,257 --> 00:00:09,778
The Binder had a theory.

5
00:00:09,866 --> 00:00:13,028
When a being of great power
such as a God is killed,

6
00:00:13,116 --> 00:00:14,489
their energy is lost.

7
00:00:14,577 --> 00:00:16,794
But he believed
it could be preserved,

8
00:00:16,882 --> 00:00:19,419
effectively turning
the magician into a God.

9
00:00:19,507 --> 00:00:21,701
- Oh, thank Christ.
- I didn't think I'd get through.

10
00:00:21,789 --> 00:00:23,468
Listen, I don't have
a lot of time.

11
00:00:23,556 --> 00:00:24,612
We need your help.

12
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:26,177
Surviving
first year students,

13
00:00:26,265 --> 00:00:29,028
I am here to teach you
what not to do.

14
00:00:29,116 --> 00:00:31,549
The Library, they don't
want you to know it.

15
00:00:31,637 --> 00:00:32,692
Before we go in,

16
00:00:32,779 --> 00:00:34,722
there's a small matter
of protection.

17
00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:36,044
- What is it?
- Insects.

18
00:00:36,132 --> 00:00:39,021
The bugs only last an hour,
so we need to be quick.

19
00:00:39,109 --> 00:00:40,640
Everett's been lying
to all of us.

20
00:00:40,728 --> 00:00:41,897
To do what?

21
00:00:42,327 --> 00:00:43,642
To become a God.

22
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:45,898
- It's locked.
- Don't you have the key?

23
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,153
Someone locked us in.

24
00:00:47,241 --> 00:00:48,857
- Who's dying?
- My sister.

25
00:00:48,945 --> 00:00:52,411
I found her a body,
but I need to find one

26
00:00:52,499 --> 00:00:54,732
that is more durable.

27
00:00:54,819 --> 00:00:56,921
Like yours.

28
00:01:08,655 --> 00:01:11,171
No running away,
little not-God.

29
00:01:11,364 --> 00:01:14,499
I'd hate to damage
my sister's new body.

30
00:01:15,736 --> 00:01:17,929
♪ Good news, sister ♪

31
00:01:18,361 --> 00:01:19,801
I have found you

32
00:01:20,015 --> 00:01:23,239
a much more durable body.

33
00:01:23,327 --> 00:01:24,833
But I am going to have

34
00:01:24,921 --> 00:01:27,476
to momentarily kill you again.

35
00:01:27,779 --> 00:01:29,359
Shh, shh.

36
00:01:31,929 --> 00:01:35,038
I beseech you,
Our Lady Underground...

37
00:01:39,723 --> 00:01:41,218
You know what, fuck this.

38
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:42,722
You said you chose me,

39
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,577
so now's your chance
to prove it.

40
00:01:44,812 --> 00:01:47,546
Julia.

41
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,577
Kinda cutting it close,
don't you think?

42
00:01:54,665 --> 00:01:56,578
I didn't come here to fix it.

43
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:57,872
I can't.

44
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,327
You still have a chance.

45
00:01:59,415 --> 00:02:01,271
A choice
of what you want to be.

46
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:05,013
You're saying this whole time
me being a human and a God,

47
00:02:05,101 --> 00:02:06,898
this was all just a test?

48
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,663
Well, both options are shit.

49
00:02:10,804 --> 00:02:14,083
I mean, you're... you're saying
one is pass and one is fail?

50
00:02:14,171 --> 00:02:16,975
You will not fail as long
as the decision is yours.

51
00:02:17,172 --> 00:02:19,890
Now go!
I can only hold him for so long!

52
00:02:19,983 --> 00:02:21,219
Oh, shit.

53
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:22,493
Run!

56
00:02:49,249 --> 00:02:51,672
- Jesus Christ.
- So the monster took Julia.

57
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:53,880
- We need to find them.
- Do something now.

58
00:02:53,968 --> 00:02:55,399
We have the axes
and the demon bottles,

59
00:02:55,486 --> 00:02:57,171
you have the incorporate bond.

60
00:02:57,679 --> 00:02:59,474
You didn't give two wet shits

61
00:02:59,562 --> 00:03:01,216
when it was Eliot's life
on the line,

62
00:03:01,304 --> 00:03:03,710
and now that it's Julia
you're suddenly leaning in?

63
00:03:03,798 --> 00:03:05,601
Look, we all care
about both of them,

64
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:07,687
but based on
Mayakovsky's formula

65
00:03:07,775 --> 00:03:09,937
casting an incorporate bond
strong enough to hold a God

66
00:03:10,025 --> 00:03:12,015
would take an insane amount
of power.

67
00:03:12,218 --> 00:03:13,349
No, we'd need twice as much.

68
00:03:13,437 --> 00:03:15,169
If we go in there
without enough juice

69
00:03:15,257 --> 00:03:16,712
they'll... they'll just body hop.

70
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:18,984
- They'll kill us all.
- Great.

71
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:22,374
Where the hell are we gonna
find that kind of magic?

72
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,712
Hey, Dean.

73
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,616
I would not go in your office
right now, if I were you.

74
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:30,075
If you shit
in my private bathroom again...

75
00:03:30,163 --> 00:03:31,835
No, well, see,
there's kind of

76
00:03:31,923 --> 00:03:34,484
a few Librarian dudes here
to arrest you.

77
00:03:34,572 --> 00:03:37,711
Yeah, they're pretty pissed
about some lecture you gave

78
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:40,122
while you were pissed.

79
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,507
I've been expecting them.

80
00:03:41,779 --> 00:03:43,171
Come with me.

81
00:03:46,007 --> 00:03:48,712
Thank Christ I wore
the right suit today.

82
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,742
The right suit
for being arrested, or...?

83
00:03:52,921 --> 00:03:54,218
Wait...

84
00:03:54,306 --> 00:03:55,435
Are you still drunk?

85
00:03:55,523 --> 00:03:57,320
That's entirely
beside the point.

86
00:03:57,408 --> 00:03:58,570
We have a bigger problem.

87
00:03:58,658 --> 00:04:00,942
Kady and Zelda haven't
returned from the Poison Room,

88
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,341
and they're running out
of time.

89
00:04:02,429 --> 00:04:04,374
Oh, shit.

90
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,752
Who are they, and what does
that mean, exactly?

91
00:04:06,839 --> 00:04:09,273
- God damn it, focus, Todd.
- Yes.

92
00:04:09,361 --> 00:04:10,959
If I'm going to be arrested,
there still maybe be a chance

93
00:04:11,046 --> 00:04:12,397
that something good
can come from it.

94
00:04:12,484 --> 00:04:13,594
Here.

95
00:04:17,751 --> 00:04:18,772
Yes, here.

96
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:20,817
Take this to the
Library book club immediately.

97
00:04:20,905 --> 00:04:22,114
Tell no one,
do you understand?

98
00:04:22,202 --> 00:04:24,684
Sure, keep it "confidench."
On it.

99
00:04:24,772 --> 00:04:26,882
And try not
to "Todd" this up.

100
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,327
I will try not to be myself.

101
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,101
Well, so much
for getting Fogg's help.

102
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,792
Well, that's the last
of our protection.

103
00:04:59,062 --> 00:05:00,842
On the upside...

104
00:05:01,124 --> 00:05:02,523
tasted minty fresh.

105
00:05:04,021 --> 00:05:05,552
Let's go.

106
00:05:08,898 --> 00:05:10,155
Wait.

107
00:05:11,062 --> 00:05:12,718
What the hell?

108
00:05:23,504 --> 00:05:24,749
Hello, there.

109
00:05:24,837 --> 00:05:27,212
Apologies, I was trying
not to startle you.

110
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:29,806
- Christopher Plover.
- Pleasure.

111
00:05:30,056 --> 00:05:31,732
The children's book author?

112
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:34,139
Oh, you're familiar
with my work.

113
00:05:34,227 --> 00:05:35,343
You could say that.

114
00:05:35,431 --> 00:05:37,303
I've read
Martin Chatwin's book.

115
00:05:37,391 --> 00:05:39,696
Yes, well, not exactly
the highlight of my oath.

116
00:05:39,784 --> 00:05:43,321
Oh, you're the pervert
who turned him into The Beast.

117
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:46,766
And the man who survived
in this place for weeks.

118
00:05:47,492 --> 00:05:49,132
And I can show you how...

119
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,079
if you help me escape.

120
00:05:53,775 --> 00:05:55,694
Look, it sucks
that Fogg's out of "comish,"

121
00:05:55,782 --> 00:05:57,399
but who else can we shake down?

122
00:05:57,626 --> 00:05:59,491
Kady was trying to find
the Library stockpile.

123
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:01,204
If we knew where that was...

124
00:06:01,292 --> 00:06:03,215
Found magic, need help!

125
00:06:03,337 --> 00:06:04,477
Who sent you?

126
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:07,024
- Found magic, need help!
- Okay, where?

127
00:06:07,112 --> 00:06:08,985
- Vague as shit.
- Oh, sorry.

128
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,782
It's Fen.

129
00:06:14,719 --> 00:06:15,899
Right this way.

130
00:06:16,195 --> 00:06:18,158
High King Fen awaits.

131
00:06:32,354 --> 00:06:34,337
Whoa.

132
00:06:41,395 --> 00:06:43,588
Sort of incredible.

133
00:06:44,856 --> 00:06:46,698
Trippy.

134
00:06:46,786 --> 00:06:48,635
Oh, good, you're here.

135
00:06:49,257 --> 00:06:50,690
Fen, what is this?

136
00:06:50,896 --> 00:06:52,432
And what's with the fish?

137
00:06:52,597 --> 00:06:54,549
Follow me, come on.

138
00:07:02,093 --> 00:07:04,338
Holy shit.

139
00:07:05,316 --> 00:07:06,916
This is the reservoir?

140
00:07:07,004 --> 00:07:08,767
Ocean of pure magic.

141
00:07:09,292 --> 00:07:11,096
Pretty amazing, right?

142
00:07:11,345 --> 00:07:12,407
I found it.

143
00:07:12,495 --> 00:07:13,539
Well, Josh and me.

144
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:14,881
And Tik was there too,
I guess.

145
00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:16,484
But, no, a lot of it was me.

146
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,871
One small problem...

147
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,057
Don't touch it!

148
00:07:22,145 --> 00:07:24,018
That's the tiny little problem.

149
00:07:24,165 --> 00:07:27,541
It seems to be protected
by some sort of curse.

150
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,463
Look what it did to Josh.

151
00:07:30,906 --> 00:07:33,198
You're saying Josh
is a fucking fish?

152
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,510
Well, of course not.

153
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:36,151
He's a Fillorian Dying Fish.

154
00:07:36,254 --> 00:07:39,760
A Fillorian Fucking Fish
is a totally different species.

155
00:07:39,886 --> 00:07:41,721
Wait, "Dying Fish"?

156
00:07:41,809 --> 00:07:43,762
I really hope
that's a metaphor.

157
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:47,018
Nope, they only live
a couple days.

158
00:07:47,106 --> 00:07:48,808
And you're sure that's Josh?

159
00:07:48,896 --> 00:07:50,252
Oh, I saw it happen.

160
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,283
We were gonna come
straight to you guys,

161
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:54,616
tell you all about
how we saved the day,

162
00:07:54,704 --> 00:07:58,647
and then he touches the water
and next thing I know, boom.

163
00:07:58,906 --> 00:08:00,174
Josh Fish.

164
00:08:00,262 --> 00:08:02,745
Him and his damn showmanship.

165
00:08:03,906 --> 00:08:05,362
So is it bad
if it turns white?

166
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,354
Great Umber's taint.

167
00:08:07,442 --> 00:08:08,868
What are you doing?

168
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:11,307
Dying Fish need eye contact,

169
00:08:11,402 --> 00:08:12,979
almost constantly.

170
00:08:13,085 --> 00:08:14,743
Usually they get it
from their fish moms,

171
00:08:14,831 --> 00:08:16,764
but we'll have to fill in.

172
00:08:16,906 --> 00:08:20,401
Every pet I ever had ended up
in a shoebox or the toilet.

173
00:08:20,489 --> 00:08:21,550
This one's all you.

174
00:08:21,638 --> 00:08:22,946
It's just until we figure out

175
00:08:23,034 --> 00:08:24,643
how to turn him back
into a person.

176
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:26,176
Or the rest of his life.

177
00:08:26,264 --> 00:08:27,948
I'm not babysitting Nemo

178
00:08:28,036 --> 00:08:30,189
when we're this close
to saving Eliot.

179
00:08:30,813 --> 00:08:32,182
I've got bigger fish to fry.

180
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,018
Shh, Margo!

181
00:08:34,329 --> 00:08:36,831
Don't say "fry" and "fish."

182
00:08:40,022 --> 00:08:42,763
It's not working.
He's not getting better.

183
00:08:42,851 --> 00:08:44,604
Margo, please.

184
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:46,596
For Josh?

185
00:08:46,947 --> 00:08:48,960
Damn it.

186
00:08:50,771 --> 00:08:52,604
So I just look at him?

187
00:08:56,748 --> 00:08:58,135
My Gods.

188
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,948
He perked right up.

189
00:09:02,377 --> 00:09:04,252
He's bonded to you.

190
00:09:05,526 --> 00:09:07,401
He thinks you're his mother.

191
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:11,768
Unfortunately, that's not
the first time it's happened.

192
00:09:12,292 --> 00:09:14,065
Closest thing to the reservoir
in the books

193
00:09:14,153 --> 00:09:15,549
is the Secret Sea.

194
00:09:15,726 --> 00:09:17,088
It's an underground ocean.

195
00:09:17,176 --> 00:09:18,821
Chatwins sailed across it

196
00:09:18,909 --> 00:09:22,213
with a crew
full of rabbit pirates.

197
00:09:22,301 --> 00:09:24,096
Are those pirates
who steal rabbits,

198
00:09:24,184 --> 00:09:25,818
or pirates who are rabbits?

199
00:09:25,906 --> 00:09:26,937
Kind of both.

200
00:09:27,025 --> 00:09:28,804
But it doesn't say anything

201
00:09:28,892 --> 00:09:31,898
about the Secret Sea
being full of magic or cursed,

202
00:09:31,986 --> 00:09:34,773
so I... maybe there's a clue
that I'm missing.

203
00:09:34,861 --> 00:09:36,954
And if your nerdy bullshit
leads us nowhere?

204
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:38,750
We need a back-up plan.

205
00:09:38,886 --> 00:09:39,759
Speaking of bunnies,

206
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:41,445
where are the ones
that Fen sent?

207
00:09:41,626 --> 00:09:42,984
I have an idea.

208
00:09:43,102 --> 00:09:45,836
So do all rabbits talk,
or...?

209
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:48,882
Some of them you have
to bribe with cigarettes first.

210
00:09:49,012 --> 00:09:50,367
Look, about my message...

211
00:09:50,422 --> 00:09:52,162
- No, I know.
- I owe you.

212
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,445
But I can't slip you
that kind of power

213
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:55,623
behind the Order's back.

214
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,336
The monsters have
two of my friends,

215
00:09:57,424 --> 00:09:59,976
and who knows what kind
of chaos they're causing

216
00:10:00,064 --> 00:10:01,541
while the Library does nothing.

217
00:10:01,629 --> 00:10:03,109
Look, Alice...

218
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:06,898
I am not stranger
to messing up a good thing.

219
00:10:07,266 --> 00:10:09,671
I'm not gonna do that
with the Library.

220
00:10:09,812 --> 00:10:11,189
Well, if we don't
do something,

221
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:12,828
there might not be
a Library anymore.

222
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,159
Then why don't you
work with us?

223
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:17,023
Because your bosses would
arrest all of us on sight.

224
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:18,258
You wanna do some good?

225
00:10:18,346 --> 00:10:20,343
This is your best chance.

226
00:10:22,406 --> 00:10:24,804
I hope you find
what you need, Alice.

227
00:10:28,881 --> 00:10:30,271
We're not setting him loose.

228
00:10:30,359 --> 00:10:31,930
All we're promising
is to take him with us

229
00:10:32,017 --> 00:10:33,412
if we find an exit.

230
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,656
Well?

231
00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:37,002
Do we have a deal?

232
00:10:43,095 --> 00:10:44,257
Moss?

233
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:47,164
My theory
is it counteracts the poison.

234
00:10:47,376 --> 00:10:49,265
Probably why it's
the only other living thing

235
00:10:49,353 --> 00:10:50,687
in this place.

236
00:10:51,792 --> 00:10:53,696
Been eating it since I got here

237
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:55,552
and I'm as healthy as a horse.

238
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,625
How did you get here?

239
00:10:58,562 --> 00:11:00,309
Former prisoner of yours,

240
00:11:00,396 --> 00:11:02,054
Alice Quinn...

241
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:05,329
seemed to think this was
the place I deserved to be.

242
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:07,345
I can't say I disagree.

243
00:11:07,564 --> 00:11:10,079
Don't bite the hand
that feeds you, dear.

244
00:11:10,406 --> 00:11:11,900
Shall we?

245
00:11:23,404 --> 00:11:25,689
At least give me my dignity.

246
00:11:25,777 --> 00:11:27,054
Sorry.

247
00:11:27,142 --> 00:11:28,235
Protocol.

248
00:11:28,436 --> 00:11:32,226
Well, this was a new suit.

249
00:11:32,729 --> 00:11:33,892
It's a bit loud.

250
00:11:34,456 --> 00:11:37,159
Yes.

251
00:11:37,246 --> 00:11:38,965
It certainly is.

252
00:11:56,313 --> 00:11:59,217
Damn, the history of this
place is depressing as shit.

253
00:11:59,305 --> 00:12:01,633
Most world histories are.

254
00:12:02,641 --> 00:12:04,262
Nothing about a way out.

255
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,332
Kady?

256
00:12:07,031 --> 00:12:08,332
Oh, shit.

257
00:12:11,054 --> 00:12:12,289
What?

258
00:12:12,437 --> 00:12:14,790
The moss should have
protected you from...

259
00:12:16,305 --> 00:12:17,656
Oh.

260
00:12:17,891 --> 00:12:19,375
"Oh," what?

261
00:12:20,015 --> 00:12:22,224
The age-suspensions spells

262
00:12:22,312 --> 00:12:25,109
Martin used to keep me alive
while he tortured me...

263
00:12:25,197 --> 00:12:26,971
It must still be
keeping me alive.

264
00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:28,146
Perfect.

265
00:12:28,234 --> 00:12:31,162
So I'm gonna die in the most
ironic way possible.

266
00:12:31,413 --> 00:12:32,944
Just like Penny.

267
00:12:34,008 --> 00:12:35,492
Well...

268
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:38,352
not necessarily.

269
00:12:39,164 --> 00:12:41,479
If we get back in time...

270
00:12:43,586 --> 00:12:44,992
Wait...

271
00:12:46,359 --> 00:12:48,305
All this time...

272
00:12:48,914 --> 00:12:50,670
the Library had a cure?

273
00:12:50,758 --> 00:12:52,943
- Kady...
- No, you...

274
00:12:53,185 --> 00:12:54,661
you chose...

275
00:12:54,904 --> 00:12:56,542
not to save Penny?

276
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:58,552
- If it were up to me...
- It was.

277
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,323
It's called
"The Poison Room."

278
00:13:00,411 --> 00:13:02,735
The name is a warning
Penny chose to ignore.

279
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,539
No, no, no, you don't get
to hide behind the Library.

280
00:13:05,627 --> 00:13:08,141
You think if you're a cog
in a fascist machine

281
00:13:08,229 --> 00:13:11,211
that you're not responsible
for the people that it kills?

282
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:12,586
I'll admit,
he Library veered

283
00:13:12,674 --> 00:13:15,162
in an authoritarian direction.

284
00:13:15,499 --> 00:13:16,845
Because of Everett.

285
00:13:16,933 --> 00:13:18,276
Once we remove
him from power...

286
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:19,954
No, no, it is not
just Everett.

287
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:22,066
It's the whole god damn Order.

288
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:24,605
It all needs
to be burned down.

289
00:13:25,081 --> 00:13:26,980
Not if it can be reformed.

290
00:13:27,198 --> 00:13:30,329
Look, as... as someone
who lived through

291
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:32,149
two world wars, I can tell you,

292
00:13:32,237 --> 00:13:34,587
authoritarian regimes,
they fail eventually.

293
00:13:34,675 --> 00:13:36,698
See? Look, even the
pedophile agrees with me.

294
00:13:36,786 --> 00:13:38,729
Oh, hardly.

295
00:13:39,456 --> 00:13:41,019
Problem is...

296
00:13:41,719 --> 00:13:43,812
no one will ever
let you change.

297
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,833
People always see you
for what you've done,

298
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,783
never for who you are.

299
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,078
So at the end of the day,

300
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,399
no matter what you try
to become,

301
00:13:51,486 --> 00:13:52,875
some judgmental blonde bitch

302
00:13:52,963 --> 00:13:55,244
always shoves you down
a poison well.

303
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,932
Yeah?

304
00:13:58,749 --> 00:14:00,832
Well, then I'm
Team Blonde Bitch.

305
00:14:08,394 --> 00:14:09,384
Where's Fen?

306
00:14:09,472 --> 00:14:10,813
I sent her out
for fish flakes

307
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,743
three hours ago.

308
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,267
Wait, you sent her out alone
in Manhattan?

309
00:14:15,369 --> 00:14:16,531
Well, I kind of implied

310
00:14:16,619 --> 00:14:18,650
it was her fault
Josh was a fish

311
00:14:18,738 --> 00:14:20,862
and blah, blah, blah,
I'd blame her forever,

312
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:23,134
so she's cooling off
at Benihana.

313
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:27,015
She never could resist
a sharp knife.

314
00:14:27,406 --> 00:14:29,815
Meanwhile, I'm trying
to read up on a damn cure

315
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:31,508
while maintaining
constant eye contact

316
00:14:31,596 --> 00:14:33,529
with an anchovy.

317
00:14:33,617 --> 00:14:35,422
And they say girls
are the ones who get needy

318
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,403
once you fuck them.

319
00:14:37,562 --> 00:14:39,743
Wait... wait, you and Josh...

320
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,281
Wait, you know about

321
00:14:41,476 --> 00:14:43,547
the little
werewolf stuff, right?

322
00:14:43,635 --> 00:14:45,273
Who gives a shit?

323
00:14:45,361 --> 00:14:47,264
- Nothing matters.
- Okay.

324
00:14:47,352 --> 00:14:49,425
Look, it's not
a big deal, all right?

325
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:51,713
Sometimes we bang.

326
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,945
He makes me laugh.

327
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:54,656
And I like having him around

328
00:14:54,744 --> 00:14:56,412
'cause of the
aforementioned banging,

329
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,813
and he just... you know,
he kind of gets me.

330
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,428
So what?

331
00:14:59,516 --> 00:15:01,740
It's not like I'm in love
with Josh Hoberman.

332
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:04,623
It kinda sounds
like you are, though.

333
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,411
Have you met me?

334
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,529
I don't do feelings.

335
00:15:09,497 --> 00:15:11,435
I'm the bitch
with the ice axes.

336
00:15:11,523 --> 00:15:13,686
Well, you can still
care about a guy...

337
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,498
Werewolf, fish...

338
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,176
And it doesn't make you
any less you.

339
00:15:19,264 --> 00:15:21,410
I mean, you can still be
a bitch if you want to.

340
00:15:23,081 --> 00:15:24,621
Shit.

341
00:15:26,568 --> 00:15:29,316
Maybe I do love
this goddamn guppy.

342
00:15:30,191 --> 00:15:33,371
Uh, I think this is
the Hedge doctor

343
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:35,298
that Kady called
to fix Pete.

344
00:15:35,386 --> 00:15:36,636
Says he's a veterinarian.

345
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,025
Maybe he can help
with the fish-Josh.

346
00:15:39,113 --> 00:15:40,246
Josh-fish.

347
00:15:40,334 --> 00:15:42,900
Way to be useful, Coldwater.

348
00:15:46,095 --> 00:15:47,529
Is this Gordy?

349
00:15:47,662 --> 00:15:50,260
Yeah, I've got fish problems.

350
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,444
- Josh and Margo.
- Yeah.

351
00:16:06,374 --> 00:16:07,703
Okay, here's my thing:

352
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,522
Um...

353
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:14,131
I didn't think that I could
ever trust you again.

354
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:17,967
And now...

355
00:16:18,543 --> 00:16:20,209
"And now"?

356
00:16:20,801 --> 00:16:23,538
I find myself wanting to.

357
00:16:37,484 --> 00:16:39,557
When we first met...

358
00:16:39,824 --> 00:16:42,944
I was clinging onto some...

359
00:16:43,484 --> 00:16:47,484
naive, idealistic notions
of what the world should be.

360
00:16:48,765 --> 00:16:50,874
How people should be.

361
00:16:52,548 --> 00:16:55,448
And I think
that I have realized...

362
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:00,928
If I just throw away
all that childish bullshit,

363
00:17:01,622 --> 00:17:04,459
I can forgive people...

364
00:17:06,376 --> 00:17:10,389
For not living up
to my stupid expectations.

365
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:13,069
Like yourself?

366
00:17:19,389 --> 00:17:21,549
What if we tried again?

367
00:17:23,228 --> 00:17:26,005
I want you in my life, Alice.

368
00:17:27,177 --> 00:17:29,044
I want that, too.

369
00:17:40,966 --> 00:17:43,591
Cyrus.

370
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,614
There was an intrusion
in the Poison Room.

371
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,646
It's Zelda.

372
00:17:49,224 --> 00:17:51,302
With a hedge witch.

373
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,354
Did you follow protocol?

374
00:17:54,442 --> 00:17:56,778
Yes, they're locked in.

375
00:17:57,469 --> 00:18:00,255
But do we really just
leave her to die in there?

376
00:18:10,488 --> 00:18:12,461
How long do you think we have?

377
00:18:12,743 --> 00:18:14,097
If we got out now?

378
00:18:14,185 --> 00:18:15,825
A few days.

379
00:18:17,113 --> 00:18:18,755
In here?

380
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:20,810
A few hours.

381
00:18:21,212 --> 00:18:24,215
The after-effects of the bugs
slowed the...

382
00:18:24,544 --> 00:18:25,671
Zelda?

383
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:27,359
Shit.

384
00:18:36,378 --> 00:18:38,507
Sorry to knock you out
like that.

385
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:40,992
It's the only way
we could talk.

386
00:18:50,514 --> 00:18:51,889
You could have freed me.

387
00:18:52,219 --> 00:18:53,628
You brought a hedge witch

388
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:55,599
into our
most protected archive.

389
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,191
I read your book.

390
00:18:57,287 --> 00:18:58,498
You're hoarding magic.

391
00:18:58,625 --> 00:18:59,872
Trying to become a God.

392
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,285
Why?

393
00:19:01,373 --> 00:19:02,733
I put in centuries of work

394
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,793
before you ever knew
the Library existed.

395
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,773
Oh, so I wouldn't understand.

396
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,045
No, you should understand.

397
00:19:08,153 --> 00:19:09,176
How...

398
00:19:10,391 --> 00:19:12,131
Futile it all is.

399
00:19:12,225 --> 00:19:15,269
We work so hard to protect
the flame of knowledge,

400
00:19:15,357 --> 00:19:18,373
but there will always be things
we can't understand.

401
00:19:18,498 --> 00:19:19,912
Knowledge of the Gods.

402
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,105
By becoming one of them,

403
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,074
I can rip their secrets away
from them

404
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,136
and bring them back
to the Library.

405
00:19:25,224 --> 00:19:26,607
At what cost?

406
00:19:26,695 --> 00:19:29,578
An unkillable God
is on the loose as we speak.

407
00:19:29,692 --> 00:19:31,584
In the body of Eliot Waugh.

408
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:34,308
You intend to take his power.

409
00:19:34,396 --> 00:19:37,146
He has the power
to destroy everything,

410
00:19:37,263 --> 00:19:38,862
and all we have are books.

411
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,654
If we want to face
that kind of threat,

412
00:19:40,742 --> 00:19:42,365
we need power too.

413
00:19:56,857 --> 00:19:57,857
Isn't that what Bacchus

414
00:19:57,945 --> 00:19:59,246
and the others
were trying to do?

415
00:19:59,334 --> 00:20:00,913
They got drunk
on their own power.

416
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,206
Some of them literally.

417
00:20:02,303 --> 00:20:03,910
What makes you think
you won't fall prey

418
00:20:03,998 --> 00:20:05,105
to the same hubris?

419
00:20:05,193 --> 00:20:07,131
Well, I thought I had you.

420
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:15,420
Excuse me,
but isn't this book banned?

421
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,951
Like, really, really banned?

422
00:20:18,473 --> 00:20:19,496
Fuck me.

423
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:21,841
Uh, we need to get that
to the Poison Room.

424
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,083
Immediately.

425
00:20:23,171 --> 00:20:25,052
Now, now, now.

426
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:58,983
You wanted me...

427
00:21:01,239 --> 00:21:03,497
To do what, exactly?

428
00:21:03,606 --> 00:21:06,036
To take over the Library
once I'm gone.

429
00:21:06,263 --> 00:21:08,817
To see to the human concerns,

430
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:11,247
and to fix my mistakes

431
00:21:11,588 --> 00:21:13,081
with the benefit
of all the knowledge

432
00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:14,912
and the power I would bring.

433
00:21:15,223 --> 00:21:17,489
I wish you'd told me
the truth sooner.

434
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,340
So do I.

435
00:21:19,981 --> 00:21:21,084
So...

436
00:21:21,512 --> 00:21:23,012
do what you must.

437
00:21:24,473 --> 00:21:25,692
Follow protocol.

438
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,043
There is a way
you can still help me.

439
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,731
I redirected the power I need
into a reservoir,

440
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:33,873
but it triggered
a protective spell.

441
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,518
A puzzle I can't solve.

442
00:21:35,606 --> 00:21:37,557
But I've discovered
someone who can.

443
00:21:37,645 --> 00:21:39,207
Quentin Coldwater.

444
00:21:40,543 --> 00:21:42,260
Get Quentin to open
the reservoir,

445
00:21:42,348 --> 00:21:44,330
and the Library can still be
yours to lead if...

446
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:48,356
Did you slap me?

447
00:21:48,465 --> 00:21:50,426
We need to move, fast.

448
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,322
No.

449
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,361
I didn't risk my life
to save a child molester.

450
00:21:54,449 --> 00:21:55,843
- He can stay.
- What?

451
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,614
No!

452
00:21:57,702 --> 00:21:59,773
We had a deal!
Tell him!

453
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:02,853
Well, your moss
didn't do shit for us, so...

454
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:06,285
But, uh... but I can help you
get to the reservoir.

455
00:22:07,654 --> 00:22:10,332
It... it was a secret
of Martin's, and...

456
00:22:10,884 --> 00:22:12,777
I know all his secrets.

457
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:15,051
I could share them with you.

458
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,371
- Incursion protocol.
- They're patrolling.

459
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:27,262
Come on.

460
00:22:32,387 --> 00:22:34,276
Get to the earth fountain,
I'll hold them off.

461
00:22:34,364 --> 00:22:36,114
Go!

462
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,268
Damn it.

463
00:22:47,379 --> 00:22:49,301
Quite a trip you sent me on.

464
00:22:51,793 --> 00:22:53,933
You ruined my suit.

465
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,809
But the good news is...

466
00:22:57,277 --> 00:22:59,012
you're just about my size.

467
00:23:04,315 --> 00:23:06,868
Keep barking, you Schnauzer fuck.

468
00:23:06,956 --> 00:23:08,776
It won't bring back
your balls.

469
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:11,284
God, I hate animals.

470
00:23:12,198 --> 00:23:13,752
So...

471
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:15,641
goldfish troubles?

472
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:17,245
Not exactly.

473
00:23:19,057 --> 00:23:20,440
I see.

474
00:23:20,589 --> 00:23:21,922
Not a goldfish.

475
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:23,198
Some kind of hybrid?

476
00:23:23,393 --> 00:23:24,633
Oh, my God.

477
00:23:25,206 --> 00:23:27,282
I am sorry to be
the bearer of bad news,

478
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:30,440
but your fish is a werewolf.

479
00:23:31,151 --> 00:23:32,671
Wait.

480
00:23:32,758 --> 00:23:34,284
So are you.

481
00:23:34,628 --> 00:23:37,815
Did... did you fuck this fish?

482
00:23:38,034 --> 00:23:40,407
Look, he's a human
who's been cursed,

483
00:23:40,495 --> 00:23:42,110
and I need to know
how to undo it.

484
00:23:42,198 --> 00:23:44,661
Well, it's definitely not
a hedge spell.

485
00:23:44,768 --> 00:23:46,064
And without knowing
how it was cast,

486
00:23:46,151 --> 00:23:47,612
not much I can do about it.

487
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,680
So, should I just go ahead
and flush it, or...

488
00:23:49,768 --> 00:23:51,671
Again, he's a person.

489
00:23:51,792 --> 00:23:54,250
I'm gonna need you to try
a little harder, all right?

490
00:23:54,338 --> 00:23:56,596
Now, if I look away
for literally ten seconds

491
00:23:56,684 --> 00:23:57,634
he starts to die,

492
00:23:57,722 --> 00:23:59,549
and at some point
I'm gonna need to sleep

493
00:23:59,637 --> 00:24:02,456
or drop a deuce,
and I don't allow spectators.

494
00:24:03,888 --> 00:24:06,075
Yeah, there is some kind

495
00:24:06,163 --> 00:24:07,906
of bond happening there.

496
00:24:08,231 --> 00:24:09,379
Whoa.

497
00:24:09,467 --> 00:24:12,044
Your eye is crazy.

498
00:24:12,316 --> 00:24:14,159
Is that a wolf thing, or...

499
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:15,645
Fairy thing.

500
00:24:15,733 --> 00:24:17,450
Can we focus
on fish boy, please?

501
00:24:17,538 --> 00:24:19,421
It's not even attached
to your head.

502
00:24:19,634 --> 00:24:21,329
You ever pop it out?

503
00:24:21,417 --> 00:24:24,280
Why the shit would I pop out
my own eyeball, Gordy?

504
00:24:24,535 --> 00:24:27,040
So you can point it

505
00:24:27,213 --> 00:24:28,226
at your gilled lover

506
00:24:28,314 --> 00:24:30,696
while you attend to...

507
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:33,243
lady business.

508
00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:39,868
I don't know, man.

509
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,946
It feels pretty stuck in there.

510
00:24:42,695 --> 00:24:44,189
Ah!

511
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:50,366
Holy shit, it's working.

512
00:24:50,454 --> 00:24:52,100
I can still see out of it.

513
00:24:52,188 --> 00:24:55,452
You ever touch me again,
I'll pop out your balls.

514
00:24:57,192 --> 00:24:58,928
Uh...

515
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:04,704
See?

516
00:25:04,792 --> 00:25:06,155
Problem solved.

517
00:25:06,284 --> 00:25:07,459
I don't know.

518
00:25:07,551 --> 00:25:10,123
This seems
kind of problematic.

519
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:13,376
Oh, I got just the thing.

520
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,663
Really?

521
00:25:20,089 --> 00:25:24,112
Why does a veterinarian have
a pirate-themed eye patch?

522
00:25:24,238 --> 00:25:27,827
Maybe it's best we don't ask
a lot of follow-up questions.

523
00:25:29,906 --> 00:25:31,741
Jesus, what happened to you?

524
00:25:31,829 --> 00:25:33,069
Hey.

525
00:25:34,579 --> 00:25:36,163
- Just...
- Hello, Alice.

526
00:25:36,251 --> 00:25:38,284
- Thought he was dead.
- Why'd you bring him here?

527
00:25:38,372 --> 00:25:41,198
Because I just might be
the only person alive

528
00:25:41,286 --> 00:25:42,897
who knows how to access
the reservoir

529
00:25:42,985 --> 00:25:44,811
and save your friends.

530
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:47,975
Mm.

531
00:25:48,063 --> 00:25:49,846
Okay, so the... the reservoir.

532
00:25:49,934 --> 00:25:52,108
Yes, well,
that's what Martin called it.

533
00:25:52,296 --> 00:25:53,569
I thought it lacked

534
00:25:53,657 --> 00:25:55,811
a certain poetry.

535
00:25:55,995 --> 00:25:58,818
So I renamed it
the Secret Sea.

536
00:25:59,061 --> 00:26:01,639
Right, the fourth...
The fourth "Fillory" book.

537
00:26:01,771 --> 00:26:04,350
Mm. Oh, I see you
have a copy here.

538
00:26:05,177 --> 00:26:06,090
Ah.

539
00:26:06,178 --> 00:26:08,532
Oh, first edition.

540
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,543
- That must be valuable.
- Yes.

541
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:12,089
Well...

542
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,103
even more so now.

543
00:26:18,768 --> 00:26:20,305
The Watcherwoman
in the books,

544
00:26:20,393 --> 00:26:22,854
she was...

545
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,954
trying to steal all of magic
for herself, right?

546
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,361
And then...
And then Martin stops her.

547
00:26:26,448 --> 00:26:29,430
Most of that book
is pure tosh.

548
00:26:29,518 --> 00:26:32,407
I had to invent that plot
from the whole class.

549
00:26:32,495 --> 00:26:36,305
It's... well, I couldn't exactly
publish the stories

550
00:26:36,393 --> 00:26:38,430
as the children
told them to me, could I?

551
00:26:38,518 --> 00:26:39,969
I mean, the "Flying Forest,"

552
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:43,815
where the Chatwins discovered
recreational drug use?

553
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:48,188
Poor little Jane hearing about
the birds and the bees from a...

554
00:26:48,276 --> 00:26:51,578
Did you know that centaurs
view necrophilia

555
00:26:51,666 --> 00:26:53,635
as a way of honoring the dead?

556
00:26:53,723 --> 00:26:55,717
Don't think I'd get
a Carnegie Medal

557
00:26:55,805 --> 00:26:57,901
for explaining that
to children.

558
00:26:58,008 --> 00:26:59,383
I mean, then there's all the...

559
00:26:59,471 --> 00:27:01,824
All the exaggerations
and the lies.

560
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:06,080
I mean, Martin slaying
a dozen mercenaries,

561
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,227
and Jane riding
on top of a horse,

562
00:27:08,315 --> 00:27:10,336
what, 100 feet tall?

563
00:27:10,424 --> 00:27:11,768
I mean, what did she call it?

564
00:27:11,951 --> 00:27:14,014
- Cozy Horse.
- "Cozy Horse."

565
00:27:14,101 --> 00:27:16,502
Utter nonsense
thrown in there

566
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,791
just to see how much
they'd get me to believe,

567
00:27:18,951 --> 00:27:21,008
and then Jane insisted
I keep it.

568
00:27:21,096 --> 00:27:24,360
In real life, the ending was...
Was much darker.

569
00:27:24,448 --> 00:27:27,321
Oh, Martin did stop
the Watcherwoman, that's true.

570
00:27:27,409 --> 00:27:29,874
The Secret Sea was built

571
00:27:29,961 --> 00:27:31,864
by the 13th king of Fillory

572
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:34,250
to consolidate power
for himself.

573
00:27:34,338 --> 00:27:37,804
Martin wanted to make sure
that no one ever tried

574
00:27:37,891 --> 00:27:41,344
to do the same thing again
so he drained the Secret Sea,

575
00:27:41,432 --> 00:27:44,448
using the last few drops
to set a trap

576
00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:47,237
for anyone who might
one day try to refill it.

577
00:27:47,338 --> 00:27:49,305
A... a curse.

578
00:27:49,393 --> 00:27:51,970
Right, so now one
of our friends is a fish.

579
00:27:52,384 --> 00:27:54,666
Well, he was 13 at the time.

580
00:27:54,785 --> 00:27:56,078
You have to forgive

581
00:27:56,166 --> 00:27:58,721
his rather adolescent
sense of humor.

582
00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:00,732
- You know how to fix it?
- Mm-hmm.

583
00:28:00,897 --> 00:28:03,448
There's a garden
just outside the reservoir.

584
00:28:03,536 --> 00:28:06,469
The Drowned Garden,
Martin called it.

585
00:28:06,557 --> 00:28:08,588
Never did know why.

586
00:28:08,936 --> 00:28:11,176
It reacts to your emotions.

587
00:28:11,871 --> 00:28:14,207
If you're happy,
a flower blooms.

588
00:28:14,295 --> 00:28:16,498
If you're sad, another one.

589
00:28:16,586 --> 00:28:19,129
So one of the plants
is the antidote?

590
00:28:19,217 --> 00:28:20,693
Indeed.

591
00:28:22,081 --> 00:28:23,842
To make it bloom...

592
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:27,795
you have to truly love Fillory.

593
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,311
Maybe when I was 12, but...

594
00:28:36,428 --> 00:28:38,783
I don't know,
Fillory's taken away

595
00:28:38,871 --> 00:28:40,043
a lot of the shit I love.

596
00:28:40,131 --> 00:28:42,459
Martin had the same problem.

597
00:28:42,941 --> 00:28:45,178
He returned as an adult and...

598
00:28:45,342 --> 00:28:47,982
could not make
the flower bloom.

599
00:28:48,584 --> 00:28:51,303
His innocent love for Fillory

600
00:28:51,391 --> 00:28:54,004
had... had soured.

601
00:28:54,091 --> 00:28:56,164
Think we can all say why.

602
00:28:56,617 --> 00:28:57,992
Quentin.

603
00:28:59,941 --> 00:29:01,914
It has to be you.

604
00:29:03,124 --> 00:29:05,125
I'm familiar with your books.

605
00:29:05,585 --> 00:29:08,625
Even considering
your recent experiences,

606
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:11,367
Quentin has
the best chance of...

607
00:29:12,132 --> 00:29:14,039
making the garden grow.

608
00:29:18,906 --> 00:29:20,482
We don't have much time.

609
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:22,235
There's a contractor
the Library uses

610
00:29:22,323 --> 00:29:24,750
- who might be willing to...
- Text me if you find somebody.

611
00:29:35,612 --> 00:29:37,663
- So it's true?
- The Library has a cure?

612
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,563
I know, it's bullshit.

613
00:29:40,651 --> 00:29:43,258
Go with her
before it's too late.

614
00:29:44,589 --> 00:29:46,443
If this is some noble shit

615
00:29:46,531 --> 00:29:48,899
about you not owing
the Library anything...

616
00:29:52,844 --> 00:29:53,928
Oh.

617
00:29:54,016 --> 00:29:55,404
You don't want to be cured.

618
00:29:57,242 --> 00:29:58,664
'Cause for all
of the terrible shit

619
00:29:58,752 --> 00:30:00,586
we've been through,
at least the upside

620
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:02,805
is that you know that
there's a life after death

621
00:30:02,893 --> 00:30:05,439
and you get to spend forever
with the other Penny.

622
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,752
And what part of that
sounds bad?

623
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,471
The part where you're dead.

624
00:30:11,635 --> 00:30:13,297
I may not know you
the way he did,

625
00:30:13,385 --> 00:30:16,018
but I know that that would be
a hell of a waste.

626
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,377
Yeah.

627
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:22,330
Well, most things are.

628
00:30:27,689 --> 00:30:30,064
A lot's changed
since I've been gone.

629
00:30:30,346 --> 00:30:31,525
Yes.

630
00:30:31,674 --> 00:30:34,074
The humans made
lots of good stuff.

631
00:30:35,723 --> 00:30:38,187
They spend their small lives
building things

632
00:30:38,275 --> 00:30:40,934
that we could smash
in a heartbeat.

633
00:30:41,021 --> 00:30:42,248
Sounds fun.

634
00:30:42,336 --> 00:30:44,617
Perhaps you can tell me...

635
00:30:44,705 --> 00:30:46,524
Do I have a name?

636
00:30:47,695 --> 00:30:49,507
Why would you need one?

637
00:30:51,451 --> 00:30:53,507
Starbucks, mostly.

638
00:30:53,911 --> 00:30:56,161
This whole time I felt
so sorry for you.

639
00:30:56,249 --> 00:30:57,742
Lost and alone.

640
00:30:57,858 --> 00:30:59,953
But you weren't alone.
You were with the humans.

641
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:02,914
You talk like them,
you think like them.

642
00:31:04,961 --> 00:31:06,834
I ate a few of them.

643
00:31:06,921 --> 00:31:09,281
Yes, but you care
about them.

644
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:19,082
You think I'm disappointed.

645
00:31:19,187 --> 00:31:20,749
I'm not.

646
00:31:24,273 --> 00:31:26,374
Are you scared of me,
little brother?

647
00:31:26,721 --> 00:31:28,997
Would I have worked so hard
to bring you back

648
00:31:29,085 --> 00:31:30,687
if I was scared of you?

649
00:31:31,429 --> 00:31:33,663
All I thought about was you.

650
00:31:35,046 --> 00:31:37,710
After I remembered
you existed, anyway.

651
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,592
And all I thought about
was revenge.

652
00:31:40,931 --> 00:31:43,280
And I got it for you already.

653
00:31:44,001 --> 00:31:46,077
I killed Bacchus.

654
00:31:46,428 --> 00:31:48,038
Iris.

655
00:31:48,444 --> 00:31:50,085
All of them.

656
00:31:50,662 --> 00:31:52,671
Everyone who hurt you.

657
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,693
The question is,
who put us here?

658
00:31:59,797 --> 00:32:01,115
Our parents.

659
00:32:01,467 --> 00:32:03,530
They made us,
called us mistakes.

660
00:32:03,618 --> 00:32:04,766
Abandoned us.

661
00:32:04,854 --> 00:32:07,930
So, what do we do?

662
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:10,358
I like murder
as much as anyone,

663
00:32:10,446 --> 00:32:12,735
but I did all of this

664
00:32:12,823 --> 00:32:14,796
just to be with you.

665
00:32:15,196 --> 00:32:18,571
Can't we enjoy it
just for a little while?

666
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:22,186
That's not what we were
made for.

667
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:26,407
It's not that I am terrified
of the Old Gods in any way.

668
00:32:26,495 --> 00:32:28,975
It's just, how do you kill

669
00:32:29,063 --> 00:32:31,517
an intangible thought creature?

670
00:32:31,877 --> 00:32:33,985
Where do you even stab?

671
00:32:35,086 --> 00:32:37,391
They're more vulnerable
than you think...

672
00:32:37,675 --> 00:32:39,638
If we can get to their realm.

673
00:32:39,951 --> 00:32:42,164
Which we cannot.

674
00:32:42,313 --> 00:32:44,360
- We had a key.
- A scroll.

675
00:32:45,294 --> 00:32:48,026
Found it a very long time ago
on this world.

676
00:32:48,114 --> 00:32:49,154
The Order took it from us.

677
00:32:49,247 --> 00:32:51,114
They didn't even know
what they had.

678
00:32:51,255 --> 00:32:52,583
Now...

679
00:32:52,849 --> 00:32:55,786
where would a bunch
of librarians keep

680
00:32:55,874 --> 00:33:00,146
a very, very important scroll?

681
00:33:11,349 --> 00:33:12,442
Oh.

682
00:33:12,653 --> 00:33:13,700
Here.

683
00:33:14,091 --> 00:33:15,583
This has to be it.

684
00:33:15,763 --> 00:33:18,347
It's exactly
as Martin described it.

685
00:33:18,887 --> 00:33:21,925
Think... think happy thoughts

686
00:33:22,013 --> 00:33:23,327
about Fillory.

687
00:33:23,738 --> 00:33:25,044
Pure.

688
00:33:25,323 --> 00:33:26,888
Innocent.

689
00:33:28,355 --> 00:33:29,737
Maybe try talking to it.

690
00:33:29,857 --> 00:33:31,380
Okay, you just...

691
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:38,216
Well...

692
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:41,888
um, Fillory is...

693
00:33:42,732 --> 00:33:44,347
obviously great.

694
00:33:44,715 --> 00:33:47,376
Um, you know,
talking bears, right?

695
00:33:47,669 --> 00:33:49,367
Who... who could hate that?

696
00:33:49,833 --> 00:33:53,347
And... and opium in the air.

697
00:33:53,786 --> 00:33:55,337
That was...

698
00:33:55,771 --> 00:33:57,200
smart.

699
00:33:57,607 --> 00:33:59,417
And...

700
00:34:00,192 --> 00:34:02,317
socialized centaur medicine.

701
00:34:02,653 --> 00:34:03,683
Are we screwed

702
00:34:03,771 --> 00:34:05,823
because Quentin can't
get it up for Fillory?

703
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:07,645
- Just...
- Look, why don't you try...

704
00:34:07,733 --> 00:34:08,776
Okay, no, stop.

705
00:34:08,864 --> 00:34:10,456
I can't... look, you're the one
that ruined this.

706
00:34:10,543 --> 00:34:11,646
I can't do it with you
over my shoulder,

707
00:34:11,733 --> 00:34:13,897
so just... please, just go.

708
00:34:17,344 --> 00:34:19,444
God damn it.

709
00:34:27,504 --> 00:34:29,347
Okay, um...

710
00:34:29,676 --> 00:34:32,152
when I was a kid
I... I loved the Fizzy River

711
00:34:32,294 --> 00:34:33,957
that they found in book two.

712
00:34:34,294 --> 00:34:35,973
And I loved...

713
00:34:36,344 --> 00:34:38,106
I loved the Upside-Down Desert.

714
00:34:38,354 --> 00:34:40,192
You know, the...

715
00:34:40,354 --> 00:34:43,367
I can't really picture it,
but, you know, it sounds...

716
00:34:43,836 --> 00:34:46,756
it sounds cool.

717
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:51,101
I don't know, I can't...
I'm sorry.

718
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:52,983
I just... I can't...

719
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,807
Hey. Hey.

720
00:34:55,939 --> 00:34:57,883
I used to love Fillory
when I was a kid

721
00:34:57,971 --> 00:35:00,588
because I didn't know
what it was.

722
00:35:01,525 --> 00:35:03,257
Plover left out
all of the terrible shit,

723
00:35:03,344 --> 00:35:05,103
and most of the good stuff
he just made up.

724
00:35:05,588 --> 00:35:08,377
Even the fucking Cozy Horse
is a lie.

725
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:10,158
Remember what you told me

726
00:35:10,246 --> 00:35:12,159
about letting go
of who you used to be?

727
00:35:12,283 --> 00:35:14,344
I know, I'm trying.

728
00:35:14,432 --> 00:35:15,861
Don't.

729
00:35:16,829 --> 00:35:18,744
I don't want you to.

730
00:35:19,674 --> 00:35:22,267
Believing in something...
Really believing...

731
00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:24,174
Is almost impossible.

732
00:35:26,403 --> 00:35:28,814
But the Quentin I first met...

733
00:35:29,363 --> 00:35:31,549
he believed in magic.

734
00:35:32,314 --> 00:35:34,228
And in Fillory.

735
00:35:34,557 --> 00:35:36,330
He changed.

736
00:35:36,829 --> 00:35:38,822
He grew up.

737
00:35:39,853 --> 00:35:42,744
Being an adult doesn't mean
that you have to throw away

738
00:35:42,832 --> 00:35:44,697
what you used to love.

739
00:35:45,494 --> 00:35:47,252
Then what does it mean?

740
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,916
Seeing the world
through new eyes.

741
00:35:56,294 --> 00:35:58,861
And for what it's worth,

742
00:35:59,517 --> 00:36:00,955
the Cozy Horse is real.

743
00:36:01,088 --> 00:36:02,546
I saw it when I was a niffin.

744
00:36:02,634 --> 00:36:04,752
So big you could
build a house on it.

745
00:36:06,938 --> 00:36:08,428
So...

746
00:36:09,118 --> 00:36:10,760
let's go.

747
00:36:28,892 --> 00:36:31,017
Okay, it's just you and me.

748
00:36:34,041 --> 00:36:35,237
You know the worst part

749
00:36:35,334 --> 00:36:37,361
of getting exactly
what you want?

750
00:36:40,446 --> 00:36:42,330
When it's not good enough.

751
00:36:45,221 --> 00:36:47,025
Then what do you do?

752
00:36:49,932 --> 00:36:52,554
If this can't make me happy,
then what would?

753
00:36:58,033 --> 00:37:00,767
Fillory was supposed
to mean something.

754
00:37:01,955 --> 00:37:05,682
I was supposed
to mean something here.

755
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,742
But it's all... it's just...
It's random.

756
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:10,851
It's so random

757
00:37:10,939 --> 00:37:12,711
that the only way
to save my friends

758
00:37:12,799 --> 00:37:15,384
is to yell at a fucking plant!

759
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:21,892
Honestly, fuck Fillory
for being so disappointing.

760
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:25,852
You know what,
maybe I was better off

761
00:37:25,939 --> 00:37:28,127
just believing
that it was fiction.

762
00:37:30,076 --> 00:37:32,136
The idea of Fillory

763
00:37:32,284 --> 00:37:34,397
is what saved my life!

764
00:37:38,603 --> 00:37:40,806
This promise...

765
00:37:41,924 --> 00:37:43,838
that...

766
00:37:44,712 --> 00:37:46,419
people like me...

767
00:37:49,931 --> 00:37:52,892
People like me...

768
00:37:53,447 --> 00:37:55,306
Can somehow...

769
00:37:58,994 --> 00:38:00,366
Find an escape.

770
00:38:04,134 --> 00:38:06,713
There has gotta be
some power in that.

771
00:38:09,486 --> 00:38:13,799
Shouldn't loving the idea
of Fillory be enough?

772
00:38:40,205 --> 00:38:41,477
Guys.

773
00:38:44,103 --> 00:38:46,814
Guys, something's happening!

774
00:39:11,778 --> 00:39:13,377
Here's the door.

775
00:39:54,695 --> 00:39:58,094
The key to the realm
of the Old Gods.

776
00:40:25,207 --> 00:40:27,512
How the hell
does this thing work?

777
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:31,676
Give this to Margo.

778
00:40:31,764 --> 00:40:34,363
If Plover's right,
it should cure Josh.

779
00:40:35,088 --> 00:40:37,277
Monsters in Library!

780
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:44,003
- Sheila must have sent it.
- Monsters in Library!

781
00:40:44,091 --> 00:40:45,646
All right, we have to go
before they leave.

782
00:40:45,733 --> 00:40:47,318
Okay, I'll grab Margo
and the axes.

783
00:40:47,406 --> 00:40:48,725
Hey, you sure
this is gonna work?

784
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:49,825
Well, either it will,

785
00:40:49,913 --> 00:40:51,707
or when you come back
we'll both be fish.

786
00:40:51,795 --> 00:40:53,754
Well, that'd be
an improvement.

787
00:40:58,807 --> 00:41:00,770
- Okay.
- Okay.

788
00:41:04,414 --> 00:41:05,949
Do you feel anything?

789
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,949
Super stressed out?

790
00:41:08,509 --> 00:41:10,051
Okay.

791
00:41:13,864 --> 00:41:15,442
Ugh.

792
00:41:16,312 --> 00:41:19,193
Yeah, I'm totally feeling that.

793
00:41:19,373 --> 00:41:20,769
Okay.

794
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:25,314
Grab your axes.

795
00:41:25,402 --> 00:41:27,215
Monsters in the Library.

796
00:41:27,907 --> 00:41:29,254
Are you baking for a fish?

797
00:41:29,342 --> 00:41:30,817
He has a refined palate.

798
00:41:31,324 --> 00:41:33,261
Yeah, here, this should fix
the whole fish deal.

799
00:41:33,348 --> 00:41:34,926
And, yes, I noticed

800
00:41:35,014 --> 00:41:36,037
that your eyeball
isn't in your head,

801
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:37,101
but honestly,
we do not have time

802
00:41:37,188 --> 00:41:37,934
for me to hear that story.

803
00:41:38,022 --> 00:41:40,144
- How long does the leaf take?
- I don't know.

804
00:41:40,232 --> 00:41:42,481
But you know it works?

805
00:41:44,989 --> 00:41:46,738
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

806
00:41:46,826 --> 00:41:48,729
but I can't go
until he's cured.

807
00:41:48,871 --> 00:41:50,884
If I leave, Josh will die.

808
00:41:51,049 --> 00:41:53,079
- It's okay.
- Penny.

809
00:41:53,288 --> 00:41:54,411
I'll bring Eliot back.

810
00:41:54,825 --> 00:41:56,231
I promise.

811
00:42:00,798 --> 00:42:02,926
Damn cheap bastards.

812
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,629
No, no, please!

813
00:42:04,717 --> 00:42:05,986
No! No!

814
00:42:07,645 --> 00:42:09,176
Shit.

815
00:42:17,613 --> 00:42:20,496
What did you do
to get locked in this cage?

816
00:42:21,727 --> 00:42:23,199
Well, I...

817
00:42:23,918 --> 00:42:26,902
I went against
every instinct I had.

818
00:42:27,082 --> 00:42:29,740
I tried to make
a goddamn difference.

819
00:42:30,136 --> 00:42:33,094
Which, for the record,
you should never, ever do.

820
00:42:36,746 --> 00:42:38,321
Julia...

821
00:42:39,055 --> 00:42:41,500
if... if you're in there,

822
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:43,710
then I'm sorry...

823
00:42:44,141 --> 00:42:47,076
for everything
that happened to you...

824
00:42:48,313 --> 00:42:49,383
Because of me.

825
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:51,664
Hey, monster.

826
00:42:51,938 --> 00:42:53,282
Lady.

827
00:43:06,996 --> 00:43:08,710
Adorable.
