1
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,660
Previously, on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:11,070
A huge reservoir of magic
hidden underneath the castle?

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,200
Where does it lead?
To Roderick's secret chamber?

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,730
The Binder had a theory.

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,170
When a being of great power
such as a God is killed,

6
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,480
their energy is lost.

7
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,830
But he believed it could be preserved,

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,530
effectively turning
the magician into a God.

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,710
Oh, thank Christ.
I didn't think I'd get through.

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,500
Listen, I don't have a lot of time.

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,720
We need your help.

12
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,270
Surviving first year students,

13
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,010
I am here to teach you what not to do.

14
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,540
The Library, they don't
want you to know it.

15
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:38,710
Before we go in,

16
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,800
there's a small matter of protection.

17
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,280
- What is it?
- Insects.

18
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,020
The bugs only last an hour,
so we need to be quick.

19
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,760
Everett's been lying to all of us.

20
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,550
To do what?

21
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,810
To become a God.

22
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,070
- It's locked.
- Don't you have the key?

23
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,420
Someone locked us in.

24
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,990
- Who's dying?
- My sister.

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,900
I found her a body,
but I need to find one

26
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,860
that is more durable.

27
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:02,160
Like yours.

28
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,360
No running away, little not-God.

29
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:20,450
I'd hate to damage my sister's new body.

30
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,410
â™ª Good news, sister

31
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,110
I have found you

32
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,110
a much more durable body.

33
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,850
But I am going to have

34
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,810
to momentarily kill you again.

35
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,460
Shh, shh.

36
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,600
I beseech you, Our Lady Underground...

37
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,430
You know what, fuck this.

38
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,820
You said you chose me,

39
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:51,000
so now's your chance to prove it.

40
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:53,090
Julia.

41
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,620
Kinda cutting it close, don't you think?

42
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,620
I didn't come here to fix it.

43
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,800
I can't.

44
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:05,549
You still have a chance.

45
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,360
A choice of what you want to be.

46
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:10,980
You're saying this whole time
me being a human and a God,

47
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,810
this was all just a test?

48
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,680
Well, both options are shit.

49
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:20,070
I mean, you're... you're saying
one is pass and one is fail?

50
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,940
You will not fail as long
as the decision is yours.

51
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,030
Now go! I can only hold him for so long!

52
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,380
Oh, shit.

53
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,730
Run!

54
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,250
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -

55
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,680
- Jesus Christ.
So the monster took Julia.

56
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,950
We need to find them. Do something now.

57
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,460
We have the axes and the demon bottles,

58
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,510
you have the incorporate bond.

59
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,450
You didn't give two wet shits

60
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,080
when it was Eliot's life on the line,

61
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:10,080
and now that it's Julia
you're suddenly leaning in?

62
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,730
Look, we all care about both of them,

63
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,730
but based on Mayakovsky's formula

64
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,000
casting an incorporate bond
strong enough to hold a God

65
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:18,090
would take an insane amount of power.

66
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,480
No, we'd need twice as much.

67
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,090
If we go in there without enough juice

68
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,740
they'll... they'll just body hop.

69
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,620
- They'll kill us all.
- Great.

70
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,970
Where the hell are we gonna
find that kind of magic?

71
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,750
Hey, Dean.

72
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,670
I would not go in your office
right now, if I were you.

73
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,150
If you shit
in my private bathroom again...

74
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,930
No, well, see, there's kind of

75
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,670
a few Librarian dudes here
to arrest you.

76
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,760
Yeah, they're pretty pissed
about some lecture you gave

77
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,940
while you were pissed.

78
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:47,730
I've been expecting them.

79
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,120
Come with me.

80
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,860
Thank Christ I wore
the right suit today.

81
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,870
The right suit
for being arrested, or...?

82
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,480
Wait...

83
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,610
Are you still drunk?

84
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,520
That's entirely beside the point.

85
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,760
We have a bigger problem.

86
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,050
Kady and Zelda haven't
returned from the Poison Room,

87
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:10,460
- and they're running out of time.
- Oh, shit.

88
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,920
Who are they, and what does
that mean, exactly?

89
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:15,250
- God damn it, focus, Todd.
- Yes.

90
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,040
If I'm going to be arrested,
there still maybe be a chance

91
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,670
that something good can come from it.

92
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,070
Here.

93
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,940
Yes, here. Take this to the
Library book club immediately.

94
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,940
- Tell no one, do you understand?
- Sure, keep it "confidench."

95
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:33,810
- On it.
- And try not to "Todd" this up.

96
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:37,300
I will try not to be myself.

97
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,830
Well, so much for getting Fogg's help.

98
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:04,020
Well, that's the last of our protection.

99
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,200
On the upside...

100
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,590
tasted minty fresh.

101
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,240
Let's go.

102
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,030
Wait.

103
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,560
What the hell?

104
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,780
Hello, there.

105
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,700
Apologies, I was trying
not to startle you.

106
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,880
Christopher Plover. Pleasure.

107
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,840
The children's book author?

108
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:40,230
Oh, you're familiar with my work.

109
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,270
You could say that.

110
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,060
I've read Martin Chatwin's book.

111
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:46,230
Yes, well, not exactly
the highlight of my oath.

112
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,240
Oh, you're the pervert
who turned him into The Beast.

113
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:53,290
And the man who survived
in this place for weeks.

114
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,070
And I can show you how...

115
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,360
if you help me escape.

116
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:02,540
Look, it sucks
that Fogg's out of "comish,"

117
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:03,850
but who else can we shake down?

118
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,360
Kady was trying to find
the Library stockpile.

119
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,180
If we knew where that was...

120
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,230
Found magic, need help!

121
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,450
Who sent you?

122
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,060
- Found magic, need help!
- Okay, where?

123
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,110
- Vague as shit.
- Oh, sorry.

124
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,020
It's Fen.

125
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,200
Right this way.

126
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,380
High King Fen awaits.

127
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,430
Whoa.

128
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,480
Sort of incredible.

129
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,270
Trippy.

130
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,100
Oh, good, you're here.

131
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,620
Fen, what is this?

132
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,530
And what's with the fish?

133
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,800
Follow me, come on.

134
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:12,240
Holy shit.

135
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,990
This is the reservoir?

136
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,680
Ocean of pure magic.

137
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,380
Pretty amazing, right?

138
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,420
I found it. Well, Josh and me.

139
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:24,560
And Tik was there too, I guess.
But, no, a lot of it was me.

140
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,780
One small problem...

141
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:31,040
don't touch it!
That's the tiny little problem.

142
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,260
It seems to be protected
by some sort of curse.

143
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:37,660
Look what it did to Josh.

144
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:39,990
You're saying Josh is a fucking fish?

145
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,450
Well, of course not.

146
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,190
He's a Fillorian Dying Fish.

147
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,630
A Fillorian Fucking Fish
is a totally different species.

148
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,720
Wait, "Dying Fish"?

149
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:50,850
I really hope that's a metaphor.

150
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,860
Nope, they only live a couple days.

151
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,640
And you're sure that's Josh?

152
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:57,210
Oh, I saw it happen.

153
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,300
We were gonna come straight to you guys,

154
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,690
tell you all about how we saved the day,

155
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,690
and then he touches the water
and next thing I know, boom.

156
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,830
Josh Fish.

157
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,520
Him and his damn showmanship.

158
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,220
So is it bad if it turns white?

159
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,350
Great Umber's taint.

160
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,700
What are you doing?

161
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:18,400
Dying Fish need eye contact,

162
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,840
almost constantly.

163
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,620
Usually they get it
from their fish moms,

164
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,670
but we'll have to fill in.

165
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,450
Every pet I ever had ended up
in a shoebox or the toilet.

166
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,670
This one's all you.

167
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,330
It's just until we figure out how
to turn him back into a person.

168
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,940
Or the rest of his life.

169
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,770
I'm not babysitting Nemo

170
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,590
when we're this close to saving Eliot.

171
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,000
I've got bigger fish to fry.

172
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:41,340
Shh, Margo!

173
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,910
Don't say "fry" and "fish."

174
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,690
It's not working.
He's not getting better.

175
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,610
Margo, please.

176
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,830
For Josh?

177
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,180
Damn it.

178
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,400
So I just look at him?

179
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,450
My Gods.

180
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,800
He perked right up.

181
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,370
He's bonded to you.

182
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,420
He thinks you're his mother.

183
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:19,380
Unfortunately, that's not
the first time it's happened.

184
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:22,550
Closest thing to the reservoir
in the books is the Secret Sea.

185
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,200
It's an underground ocean.

186
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,820
Chatwins sailed across it

187
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,990
with a crew full of rabbit pirates.

188
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,210
Are those pirates who steal rabbits,

189
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,690
or pirates who are rabbits?

190
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,780
Kind of both.

191
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,870
But it doesn't say anything

192
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,830
about the Secret Sea
being full of magic or cursed,

193
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,750
so I... maybe there's a clue
that I'm missing.

194
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,440
And if your nerdy bullshit
leads us nowhere?

195
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,620
We need a back-up plan.

196
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,750
Speaking of bunnies,

197
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,580
where are the ones that Fen sent?

198
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,970
I have an idea.

199
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,280
So do all rabbits talk, or...?

200
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,890
Some of them you have
to bribe with cigarettes first.

201
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,099
Look, about my message...

202
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,810
No, I know. I owe you.

203
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,500
But I can't slip you that kind of power

204
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,590
behind the Order's back.

205
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,330
The monsters have two of my friends,

206
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,860
and who knows what kind
of chaos they're causing

207
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,380
while the Library does nothing.

208
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:10,340
Look, Alice...

209
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:13,910
I am not stranger
to messing up a good thing.

210
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,610
I'm not gonna do that with the Library.

211
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,099
Well, if we don't do something,

212
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,780
there might not be a Library anymore.

213
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:21,220
Then why don't you work with us?

214
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,880
Because your bosses would
arrest all of us on sight.

215
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,310
You wanna do some good?

216
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,800
This is your best chance.

217
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,330
I hope you find what you need, Alice.

218
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,280
We're not setting him loose.

219
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:40,370
All we're promising is to take
him with us if we find an exit.

220
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,810
Well?

221
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,460
Do we have a deal?

222
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,210
Moss?

223
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,300
My theory is it counteracts the poison.

224
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:56,300
Probably why it's
the only other living thing

225
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,910
in this place.

226
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,560
Been eating it since I got here

227
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,440
and I'm as healthy as a horse.

228
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:05,440
How did you get here?

229
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,350
Former prisoner of yours,

230
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,490
Alice Quinn...

231
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,450
seemed to think this was
the place I deserved to be.

232
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,970
I can't say I disagree.

233
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,410
Don't bite the hand
that feeds you, dear.

234
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,580
Shall we?

235
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,680
At least give me my dignity.

236
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:33,950
Sorry.

237
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,510
Protocol.

238
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,830
Well, this was a new suit.

239
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,560
It's a bit loud.

240
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:43,870
Yes.

241
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,500
It certainly is.

242
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,880
Damn, the history of this
place is depressing as shit.

243
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:10,200
Most world histories are.

244
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:12,500
Nothing about a way out.

245
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,720
Kady?

246
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,810
Oh, shit.

247
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,990
What?

248
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,990
The moss should have
protected you from...

249
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,740
Oh.

250
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,700
"Oh," what?

251
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,090
The age-suspensions spells

252
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,010
Martin used to keep me alive
while he tortured me...

253
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,750
it must still be keeping me alive.

254
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,060
Perfect.

255
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:39,410
So I'm gonna die in the most
ironic way possible.

256
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,720
Just like Penny.

257
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,610
Well...

258
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:46,950
not necessarily.

259
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,550
If we get back in time...

260
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,540
Wait...

261
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:56,550
All this time...

262
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,480
the Library had a cure?

263
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:01,000
- Kady...
- No, you...

264
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,510
you chose...

265
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:04,260
not to save Penny?

266
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,420
- If it were up to me...
- It was.

267
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:07,950
It's called "The Poison Room."

268
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,910
The name is a warning
Penny chose to ignore.

269
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,170
No, no, no, you don't get
to hide behind the Library.

270
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,000
You think if you're a cog
in a fascist machine

271
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:18,780
that you're not responsible
for the people that it kills?

272
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,260
I'll admit, he Library veered

273
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:23,140
in an authoritarian direction.

274
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,530
Because of Everett.

275
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,970
Once we remove him from power...

276
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,780
No, no, it is not just Everett.

277
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,970
It's the whole god damn Order.

278
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,540
It all needs to be burned down.

279
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,970
Not if it can be reformed.

280
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,020
Look, as... as someone who lived through

281
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,800
two world wars, I can tell you,

282
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:42,070
authoritarian regimes,
they fail eventually.

283
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,370
See? Look, even the
pedophile agrees with me.

284
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,460
Oh, hardly.

285
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:49,290
Problem is...

286
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,950
no one will ever let you change.

287
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,580
People always see you
for what you've done,

288
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,300
never for who you are.

289
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,000
So at the end of the day,

290
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:00,719
no matter what you try to become,
some judgmental blonde bitch

291
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,920
always shoves you down a poison well.

292
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:05,000
Yeah?

293
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,490
Well, then I'm Team Blonde Bitch.

294
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:18,500
- Where's Fen?
- I sent her out for fish flakes

295
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:20,240
three hours ago.

296
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,120
Wait, you sent her out alone
in Manhattan?

297
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,290
Well, I kind of implied

298
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,210
it was her fault Josh was a fish

299
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,640
and blah, blah, blah,
I'd blame her forever,

300
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,520
so she's cooling off at Benihana.

301
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:34,650
She never could resist a sharp knife.

302
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,719
Meanwhile, I'm trying
to read up on a damn cure

303
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,180
while maintaining constant eye contact

304
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,220
with an anchovy.

305
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:43,220
And they say girls
are the ones who get needy

306
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,180
once you fuck them.

307
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,230
Wait... wait, you and Josh...

308
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,620
Wait, you know about

309
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,270
the little werewolf stuff, right?

310
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,150
Who gives a shit?

311
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,100
- Nothing matters.
- Okay.

312
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:57,670
Look, it's not a big deal, all right?

313
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,110
Sometimes we bang.

314
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,590
He makes me laugh.

315
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,680
And I like having him around 'cause
of the aforementioned banging,

316
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:05,460
and he just... you know,
he kind of gets me.

317
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,250
So what?

318
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,510
It's not like I'm in love
with Josh Hoberman.

319
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,340
It kinda sounds like you are, though.

320
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,300
Have you met me?

321
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:16,690
I don't do feelings.

322
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,260
I'm the bitch with the ice axes.

323
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,480
Well, you can still care about a guy...

324
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:24,440
werewolf, fish...

325
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,750
and it doesn't make you any less you.

326
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,680
I mean, you can still be
a bitch if you want to.

327
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,510
Shit.

328
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:37,030
Maybe I do love this goddamn guppy.

329
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,819
Uh, I think this is the hedge doctor

330
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,380
that Kady called to fix Pete.

331
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,510
Says he's a veterinarian.

332
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,770
Maybe he can help with the fish-Josh.

333
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,210
Josh-fish.

334
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,520
Way to be useful, Coldwater.

335
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:55,300
Is this Gordy?

336
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:58,050
Yeah, I've got fish problems.

337
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,710
- Josh and Margo.
- Yeah.

338
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,450
Okay, here's my thing:

339
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,550
Um...

340
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:22,430
I didn't think that I could
ever trust you again.

341
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,330
And now...

342
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,640
"And now"?

343
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,430
I find myself wanting to.

344
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,790
When we first met...

345
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,270
I was clinging onto some...

346
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:55,240
naive, idealistic notions
of what the world should be.

347
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:59,200
How people should be.

348
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:03,420
And I think that I have realized...

349
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,330
If I just throw away
all that childish bullshit,

350
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,420
I can forgive people...

351
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:18,080
For not living up
to my stupid expectations.

352
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:21,510
Like yourself?

353
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,750
What if we tried again?

354
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:34,740
I want you in my life, Alice.

355
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:37,280
I want that, too.

356
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:51,540
Cyrus.

357
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:54,540
There was an intrusion
in the Poison Room.

358
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:56,760
It's Zelda.

359
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:59,600
With a hedge witch.

360
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,950
Did you follow protocol?

361
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,170
Yes, they're locked in.

362
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,170
But do we really just
leave her to die in there?

363
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:20,490
How long do you think we have?

364
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,840
If we got out now?

365
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,840
A few days.

366
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,840
In here?

367
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:29,190
A few hours.

368
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,460
The after-effects of the bugs
slowed the...

369
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,590
Zelda?

370
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,940
Shit.

371
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,600
Sorry to knock you out like that.

372
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:49,300
It's the only way we could talk.

373
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,880
You could have freed me.

374
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:03,270
You brought a hedge witch into
our most protected archive.

375
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,790
I read your book.

376
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,410
You're hoarding magic.

377
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,710
Trying to become a God.

378
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,930
Why?

379
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,450
I put in centuries of work before
you ever knew the Library existed.

380
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,410
Oh, so I wouldn't understand.

381
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,850
No, you should understand.

382
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,980
How...

383
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,940
Futile it all is.

384
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,730
We work so hard to protect
the flame of knowledge,

385
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,900
but there will always be things
we can't understand.

386
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:27,560
Knowledge of the Gods.

387
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,910
By becoming one of them,

388
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,860
I can rip their secrets away from them

389
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,820
and bring them back to the Library.

390
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,430
At what cost?

391
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,350
An unkillable God
is on the loose as we speak.

392
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,530
In the body of Eliot Waugh.

393
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,010
You intend to take his power.

394
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,750
He has the power to destroy everything,

395
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,710
and all we have are books.

396
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,320
If we want to face that kind
of threat, we need power too.

397
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,120
Isn't that what Bacchus and
the others were trying to do?

398
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:08,860
They got drunk on their own power.

399
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,120
Some of them literally.

400
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,960
What makes you think you won't fall prey
to the same hubris?

401
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,600
Well, I thought I had you.

402
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,480
Excuse me, but isn't this book banned?

403
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:26,400
Like, really, really banned?

404
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:27,700
Fuck me.

405
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,660
Uh, we need to get that
to the Poison Room.

406
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:32,540
Immediately. Now, now, now.

407
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,090
You wanted me...

408
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:11,360
To do what, exactly?

409
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,840
To take over the Library once I'm gone.

410
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:16,800
To see to the human concerns,

411
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:19,360
and to fix my mistakes

412
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:22,850
with the benefit of all the knowledge
and the power I would bring.

413
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,370
I wish you'd told me the truth sooner.

414
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:27,550
So do I.

415
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,110
So...

416
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,850
do what you must.

417
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,160
Follow protocol.

418
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:36,690
There is a way you can still help me.

419
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,600
I redirected the power I need
into a reservoir,

420
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:41,690
but it triggered a protective spell.

421
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,040
A puzzle I can't solve.

422
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:45,040
But I've discovered someone who can.

423
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:47,170
Quentin Coldwater.

424
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:50,090
Get Quentin to open the reservoir,

425
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,050
and the Library can still be
yours to lead if...

426
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,100
Did you slap me?

427
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:58,750
We need to move, fast.

428
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,060
No.

429
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,249
I didn't risk my life
to save a child molester.

430
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,630
- He can stay.
- What?

431
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,580
No!

432
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,590
We had a deal! Tell him!

433
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,720
Well, your moss
didn't do shit for us, so...

434
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:13,770
But, uh... but I can help you
get to the reservoir.

435
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:18,730
It... it was a secret
of Martin's, and...

436
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,690
I know all his secrets.

437
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:23,080
I could share them with you.

438
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:33,000
Incursion protocol. They're patrolling.

439
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:35,180
Come on.

440
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,010
Get to the earth fountain,
I'll hold them off.

441
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,490
Go!

442
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:55,110
Damn it.

443
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,900
Quite a trip you sent me on.

444
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,940
You ruined my suit.

445
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:04,950
But the good news is...

446
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,170
you're just about my size.

447
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,840
Keep barking, you Schnauzer fuck.

448
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:16,750
It won't bring back your balls.

449
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,760
God, I hate animals.

450
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,760
So...

451
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,760
- goldfish troubles?
- Not exactly.

452
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:28,700
I see.

453
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:29,860
Not a goldfish.

454
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,440
Some kind of hybrid?

455
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,270
Oh, my God.

456
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,350
I am sorry to be the bearer of bad news,

457
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,320
but your fish is a werewolf.

458
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:40,800
Wait.

459
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:42,710
So are you.

460
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,190
Did... did you fuck this fish?

461
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,540
Look, he's a human who's been cursed,

462
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,280
and I need to know how to undo it.

463
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:52,720
Well, it's definitely not a hedge spell.

464
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:54,060
And without knowing how it was cast,

465
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,760
not much I can do about it.

466
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,810
So, should I just go ahead
and flush it, or...

467
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,770
Again, he's a person.

468
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,470
I'm gonna need you to try
a little harder, all right?

469
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,820
Now, if I look away
for literally ten seconds

470
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:07,420
he starts to die, and at some
point I'm gonna need to sleep

471
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,050
or drop a deuce,
and I don't allow spectators.

472
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,290
Yeah, there is some kind

473
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,730
of bond happening there.

474
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,950
Whoa.

475
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,300
Your eye is crazy.

476
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,080
Is that a wolf thing, or...

477
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,650
Fairy thing.

478
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,480
Can we focus on fish boy, please?

479
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:27,390
It's not even attached to your head.

480
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,350
You ever pop it out?

481
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,180
Why the shit would I pop out
my own eyeball, Gordy?

482
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:35,140
So you can point it

483
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,490
at your gilled lover

484
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,140
while you attend to...

485
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,640
lady business.

486
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,110
I don't know, man.

487
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,680
It feels pretty stuck in there.

488
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:51,800
Ah!

489
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,470
Holy shit, it's working.

490
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,160
I can still see out of it.

491
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:03,260
You ever touch me again,
I'll pop out your balls.

492
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,140
Uh...

493
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,440
See?

494
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,440
Problem solved.

495
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:15,610
I don't know.

496
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:18,310
This seems kind of problematic.

497
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,020
Oh, I got just the thing.

498
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:26,570
Really?

499
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,020
Why does a veterinarian have
a pirate-themed eye patch?

500
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,560
Maybe it's best we don't ask
a lot of follow-up questions.

501
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,730
Jesus, what happened to you?

502
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,550
Hey.

503
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,250
- Just...
- Hello, Alice.

504
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,340
- Thought he was dead.
- Why'd you bring him here?

505
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:49,080
Because I just might be
the only person alive

506
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:50,740
who knows how to access the reservoir

507
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,220
and save your friends.

508
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,090
Mm.

509
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,700
Okay, so the... the reservoir.

510
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:00,140
Yes, well, that's what Martin called it.

511
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,570
I thought it lacked

512
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,050
a certain poetry.

513
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,750
So I renamed it the Secret Sea.

514
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,840
Right, the fourth...
the fourth "Fillory" book.

515
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:09,870
Mm.

516
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,450
Oh, I see you have a copy here.

517
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,330
Ah.

518
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,590
Oh, first edition.

519
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,630
- That must be valuable.
- Yes.

520
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,420
Well...

521
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:22,290
even more so now.

522
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,340
The Watcherwoman in the books,

523
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:31,030
she was...

524
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,010
trying to steal all of magic
for herself, right?

525
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,520
And then... and then Martin stops her.

526
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:37,480
Most of that book is pure tosh.

527
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:40,480
I had to invent that plot
from the whole class.

528
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:44,440
It's... well, I couldn't exactly
publish the stories

529
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:46,440
as the children
told them to me, could I?

530
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:47,880
I mean, the "Flying Forest,"

531
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:52,100
where the Chatwins discovered
recreational drug use?

532
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,800
Poor little Jane hearing about
the birds and the bees from a...

533
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:59,540
did you know that centaurs
view necrophilia

534
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,760
as a way of honoring the dead?

535
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,680
Don't think I'd get a Carnegie Medal

536
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,640
for explaining that to children.

537
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,550
I mean, then there's all the...

538
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,820
all the exaggerations and the lies.

539
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:13,470
I mean, Martin slaying
a dozen mercenaries,

540
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,390
and Jane riding on top of a horse,

541
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,430
what, 100 feet tall?

542
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,910
I mean, what did she call it?

543
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,310
- Cozy Horse.
- "Cozy Horse."

544
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,660
Utter nonsense thrown in there

545
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:26,920
just to see how much
they'd get me to believe,

546
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:28,920
and then Jane insisted I keep it.

547
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:32,450
In real life, the ending was...
was much darker.

548
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,410
Oh, Martin did stop
the Watcherwoman, that's true.

549
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,890
The Secret Sea was built

550
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,850
by the 13th king of Fillory

551
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,330
to consolidate power for himself.

552
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,630
Martin wanted to make sure
that no one ever tried

553
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,420
to do the same thing again
so he drained the Secret Sea,

554
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:52,420
using the last few drops to set a trap

555
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:55,380
for anyone who might
one day try to refill it.

556
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:57,300
A... a curse.

557
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,690
Right, so now one
of our friends is a fish.

558
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,650
Well, he was 13 at the time.

559
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,220
You have to forgive

560
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:06,700
his rather adolescent sense of humor.

561
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,740
- You know how to fix it?
- Mm-hmm.

562
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,570
There's a garden
just outside the reservoir.

563
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,400
The Drowned Garden, Martin called it.

564
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:16,750
Never did know why.

565
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,540
It reacts to your emotions.

566
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:22,240
If you're happy, a flower blooms.

567
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,720
If you're sad, another one.

568
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,980
So one of the plants is the antidote?

569
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:29,250
Indeed.

570
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,510
To make it bloom...

571
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,610
you have to truly love Fillory.

572
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:44,520
Maybe when I was 12, but...

573
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:46,560
I don't know, Fillory's taken away

574
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:47,910
a lot of the shit I love.

575
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,830
Martin had the same problem.

576
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,400
He returned as an adult and...

577
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:56,490
could not make the flower bloom.

578
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,450
His innocent love for Fillory

579
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,139
had... had soured.

580
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,230
Think we can all say why.

581
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,680
Quentin.

582
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,850
It has to be you.

583
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,590
I'm familiar with your books.

584
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,940
Even considering
your recent experiences,

585
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:19,950
Quentin has the best chance of...

586
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,430
making the garden grow.

587
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,350
We don't have much time.

588
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,360
There's a contractor the Library uses

589
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:31,380
who might be willing to...

590
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:34,930
Text me if you find somebody.

591
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,580
So it's true? The Library has a cure?

592
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:48,580
I know, it's bullshit.

593
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:50,990
Go with her before it's too late.

594
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,550
If this is some noble shit

595
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,420
about you not owing
the Library anything...

596
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,810
Oh.

597
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,470
You don't want to be cured.

598
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,780
'Cause for all of the terrible shit

599
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,560
we've been through, at least the upside

600
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:10,820
is that you know that
there's a life after death

601
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:13,960
and you get to spend forever
with the other Penny.

602
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,650
And what part of that sounds bad?

603
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,920
The part where you're dead.

604
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:21,400
I may not know you the way he did,

605
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:23,600
but I know that that would be
a hell of a waste.

606
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,490
Yeah.

607
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,680
Well, most things are.

608
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:38,110
A lot's changed since I've been gone.

609
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,550
Yes.

610
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,510
The humans made lots of good stuff.

611
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:46,120
They spend their small lives
building things

612
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:49,080
that we could smash in a heartbeat.

613
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:50,170
Sounds fun.

614
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,690
Perhaps you can tell me...

615
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,080
Do I have a name?

616
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:58,440
Why would you need one?

617
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,700
Starbucks, mostly.

618
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:04,050
This whole time I felt so sorry for you.

619
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,880
Lost and alone.

620
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:08,140
But you weren't alone.
You were with the humans.

621
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:11,010
You talk like them, you think like them.

622
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:14,710
I ate a few of them.

623
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,540
Yes, but you care about them.

624
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:26,900
You think I'm disappointed.

625
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:28,560
I'm not.

626
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,820
Are you scared of me, little brother?

627
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,910
Would I have worked so hard
to bring you back

628
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,520
if I was scared of you?

629
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:43,000
All I thought about was you.

630
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:45,830
After I remembered you existed, anyway.

631
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,750
And all I thought about was revenge.

632
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:52,010
And I got it for you already.

633
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,450
I killed Bacchus.

634
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,540
Iris.

635
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,630
All of them.

636
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,680
Everyone who hurt you.

637
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,410
The question is, who put us here?

638
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,120
Our parents.

639
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:11,460
They made us, called us mistakes.

640
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,940
Abandoned us.

641
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:16,030
So, what do we do?

642
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,470
I like murder as much as anyone,

643
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,820
but I did all of this

644
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:23,040
just to be with you.

645
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:26,650
Can't we enjoy it
just for a little while?

646
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:30,379
That's not what we were made for.

647
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:34,420
It's not that I am terrified
of the Old Gods in any way.

648
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,010
It's just, how do you kill

649
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,800
an intangible thought creature?

650
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:42,890
Where do you even stab?

651
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,630
They're more vulnerable
than you think...

652
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,810
if we can get to their realm.

653
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,980
Which we cannot.

654
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:53,460
We had a key. A scroll.

655
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:55,990
Found it a very long time ago
on this world.

656
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,120
The Order took it from us.

657
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,510
They didn't even know what they had.

658
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,910
Now...

659
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,910
where would a bunch of librarians keep

660
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:08,020
a very, very important scroll?

661
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,370
Oh.

662
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,680
Here.

663
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:24,200
This has to be it.

664
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:27,510
It's exactly as Martin described it.

665
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,719
Think... think happy thoughts

666
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,390
about Fillory.

667
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,130
Pure.

668
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,960
Innocent.

669
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:38,660
Maybe try talking to it.

670
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:41,970
Okay, you just...

671
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:48,190
Well...

672
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,410
um, Fillory is...

673
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,450
obviously great.

674
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:56,739
Um, you know, talking bears, right?

675
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,550
Who... who could hate that?

676
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:02,510
And... and opium in the air.

677
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,470
That was...

678
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,340
smart.

679
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,780
And...

680
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:11,430
socialized centaur medicine.

681
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,480
Are we screwed

682
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,630
because Quentin can't
get it up for Fillory?

683
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,440
- Just...
- Look, why don't you try...

684
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:19,319
Okay, no, stop. I can't... look,
you're the one that ruined this.

685
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,190
I can't do it with you over my
shoulder, so just... please, just go.

686
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,760
God damn it.

687
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:38,500
Okay, um...

688
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:41,070
when I was a kid
I... I loved the Fizzy River

689
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,070
that they found in book two.

690
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,250
And I loved...

691
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,300
I loved the Upside-Down Desert.

692
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:49,300
You know, the...

693
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:52,610
I can't really picture it,
but, you know, it sounds...

694
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:55,310
it sounds cool.

695
00:34:58,270 --> 00:34:59,830
I don't know, I can't... I'm sorry.

696
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,190
- I just... I can't...
- Hey. Hey.

697
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,750
I used to love Fillory when I was a kid

698
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,230
because I didn't know what it was.

699
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,230
Plover left out
all of the terrible shit,

700
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,320
and most of the good stuff
he just made up.

701
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:17,630
Even the fucking Cozy Horse is a lie.

702
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,959
Remember what you told me

703
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,110
about letting go of who you used to be?

704
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,200
I know, I'm trying.

705
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:25,600
Don't.

706
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,120
I don't want you to.

707
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:31,300
Believing in something...
really believing...

708
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,920
is almost impossible.

709
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,300
But the Quentin I first met...

710
00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:41,130
he believed in magic.

711
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,440
And in Fillory.

712
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:45,620
He changed.

713
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:48,530
He grew up.

714
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:51,620
Being an adult doesn't mean
that you have to throw away

715
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:52,860
what you used to love.

716
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:57,150
Then what does it mean?

717
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,440
Seeing the world through new eyes.

718
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:07,940
And for what it's worth,

719
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:09,680
the Cozy Horse is real.

720
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:11,420
I saw it when I was a niffin.

721
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:13,600
So big you could build a house on it.

722
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:17,820
So...

723
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:20,300
let's go.

724
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,640
Okay, it's just you and me.

725
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:44,080
You know the worst part

726
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,860
of getting exactly what you want?

727
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,820
When it's not good enough.

728
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:56,520
Then what do you do?

729
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,920
If this can't make me happy,
then what would?

730
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:09,710
Fillory was supposed to mean something.

731
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:14,410
I was supposed to mean something here.

732
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,530
But it's all... it's just...
it's random.

733
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,580
It's so random

734
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,540
that the only way to save my friends

735
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:24,380
is to yell at a fucking plant!

736
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,990
Honestly, fuck Fillory
for being so disappointing.

737
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:37,430
You know what, maybe I was better off
just believing that it was fiction.

738
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:41,030
The idea of Fillory

739
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,140
is what saved my life!

740
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:50,610
This promise...

741
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:53,480
that...

742
00:37:53,490 --> 00:37:55,830
people like me...

743
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:02,320
People like me...

744
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:04,930
Can somehow...

745
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,590
Find an escape.

746
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:15,770
There has gotta be some power in that.

747
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:22,860
Shouldn't loving the idea
of Fillory be enough?

748
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:50,970
Guys.

749
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,810
Guys, something's happening!

750
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,660
Here's the door.

751
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:06,620
The key to the realm of the Old Gods.

752
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,820
How the hell does this thing work?

753
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,860
Give this to Margo.

754
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:45,260
If Plover's right, it should cure Josh.

755
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:48,220
Monsters in Library!

756
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:54,050
- Sheila must have sent it.
- Monsters in Library!

757
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,790
All right, we have to
go before they leave.

758
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,620
Okay, I'll grab Margo and the axes.

759
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,930
Hey, you sure this is gonna work?

760
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,190
Well, either it will,

761
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,980
or when you come back
we'll both be fish.

762
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:04,590
Well, that'd be an improvement.

763
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:11,110
- Okay.
- Okay.

764
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,340
Do you feel anything?

765
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:18,560
Super stressed out?

766
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:20,470
Okay.

767
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,360
Ugh.

768
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,090
Yeah, I'm totally feeling that.

769
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,870
Okay.

770
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:38,190
Grab your axes. Monsters in the Library.

771
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,500
Are you baking for a fish?

772
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:41,460
He has a refined palate.

773
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:43,370
Yeah, here, this should
fix the whole fish deal.

774
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:46,199
And, yes, I noticed that your
eyeball isn't in your head,

775
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,060
but honestly, we do not have
time for me to hear that story.

776
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,420
- How long does the leaf take?
- I don't know.

777
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:53,040
But you know it works?

778
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:57,040
I can't believe I'm saying this,

779
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:59,000
but I can't go until he's cured.

780
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:01,350
If I leave, Josh will die.

781
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,480
- It's okay.
- Penny.

782
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:05,180
I'll bring Eliot back.

783
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,870
I promise.

784
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:13,570
Damn cheap bastards.

785
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,050
No, no, please!

786
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,710
No! No!

787
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,660
Shit.

788
00:42:27,730 --> 00:42:30,640
What did you do
to get locked in this cage?

789
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:34,070
Well, I...

790
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:37,030
I went against every instinct I had.

791
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,340
I tried to make a goddamn difference.

792
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:43,080
Which, for the record,
you should never, ever do.

793
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:49,260
Julia...

794
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:51,570
if... if you're in there,

795
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:54,270
then I'm sorry...

796
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,270
for everything that happened to you...

797
00:42:58,460 --> 00:42:59,580
Because of me.

798
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:01,750
Hey, monster.

799
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,020
Lady.

800
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,380
Adorable.
