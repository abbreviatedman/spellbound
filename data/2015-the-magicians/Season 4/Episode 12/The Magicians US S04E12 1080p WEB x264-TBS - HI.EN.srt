So...

551
00:23:28,036 --> 00:23:29,159
goldfish troubles?

552
00:23:29,247 --> 00:23:30,763
Not exactly.

553
00:23:32,575 --> 00:23:33,958
I see.

554
00:23:34,107 --> 00:23:35,440
Not a goldfish.

555
00:23:35,528 --> 00:23:36,716
Some kind of hybrid?

556
00:23:36,911 --> 00:23:38,151
Oh, my God.

557
00:23:38,724 --> 00:23:40,800
I am sorry to be
the bearer of bad news,

558
00:23:40,888 --> 00:23:43,958
but your fish is a werewolf.

559
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:46,189
Wait.

560
00:23:46,276 --> 00:23:47,802
So are you.

561
00:23:48,146 --> 00:23:51,333
Did... did you fuck this fish?

562
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,925
Look, he's a human
who's been cursed,

563
00:23:54,013 --> 00:23:55,628
and I need to know
how to undo it.

564
00:23:55,716 --> 00:23:58,179
Well, it's definitely not
a hedge spell.

565
00:23:58,286 --> 00:23:59,582
And without knowing
how it was cast,

566
00:23:59,669 --> 00:24:01,130
not much I can do about it.

567
00:24:01,218 --> 00:24:03,198
So, should I just go ahead
and flush it, or...

568
00:24:03,286 --> 00:24:05,189
Again, he's a person.

569
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:07,768
I'm gonna need you to try
a little harder, all right?

570
00:24:07,856 --> 00:24:10,114
Now, if I look away
for literally ten seconds

571
00:24:10,202 --> 00:24:11,152
he starts to die,

572
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,067
and at some point
I'm gonna need to sleep

573
00:24:13,155 --> 00:24:15,974
or drop a deuce,
and I don't allow spectators.

574
00:24:17,406 --> 00:24:19,593
Yeah, there is some kind

575
00:24:19,681 --> 00:24:21,424
of bond happening there.

576
00:24:21,749 --> 00:24:22,897
Whoa.

577
00:24:22,985 --> 00:24:25,562
Your eye is crazy.

578
00:24:25,834 --> 00:24:27,677
Is that a wolf thing, or...

579
00:24:27,809 --> 00:24:29,163
Fairy thing.

580
00:24:29,251 --> 00:24:30,968
Can we focus
on fish boy, please?

581
00:24:31,056 --> 00:24:32,939
It's not even attached
to your head.

582
00:24:33,152 --> 00:24:34,847
You ever pop it out?

583
00:24:34,935 --> 00:24:37,798
Why the shit would I pop out
my own eyeball, Gordy?

584
00:24:38,053 --> 00:24:40,558
So you can point it

585
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:41,744
at your gilled lover

586
00:24:41,832 --> 00:24:44,214
while you attend to...

587
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,761
lady business.

588
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:53,386
I don't know, man.

589
00:24:53,528 --> 00:24:55,464
It feels pretty stuck in there.

590
00:24:56,213 --> 00:24:57,707
Ah!

591
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:03,884
Holy shit, it's working.

592
00:25:03,972 --> 00:25:05,618
I can still see out of it.

593
00:25:05,706 --> 00:25:08,970
You ever touch me again,
I'll pop out your balls.

594
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,446
Uh...

595
00:25:15,888 --> 00:25:18,222
[laughs]
See?

596
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,673
Problem solved.

597
00:25:19,802 --> 00:25:20,977
I don't know.

598
00:25:21,069 --> 00:25:23,641
This seems
kind of problematic.

599
00:25:23,944 --> 00:25:26,894
Oh, I got just the thing.

600
00:25:30,708 --> 00:25:32,181
Really?

601
00:25:33,607 --> 00:25:37,630
Why does a veterinarian have
a pirate-themed eye patch?

602
00:25:37,756 --> 00:25:41,345
Maybe it's best we don't ask
a lot of follow-up questions.

603
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,259
Jesus, what happened to you?

- Thought he was dead.
- Why'd you bring him here?

608
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:54,716
Because I just might be
the only person alive

609
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:56,415
who knows how to access
the reservoir

610
00:25:56,503 --> 00:25:58,329

Okay, so the... the reservoir.

614
00:26:03,452 --> 00:26:05,626
Yes, well,
that's what Martin called it.

615
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:07,087
I thought it lacked

616
00:26:07,175 --> 00:26:09,329
a certain poetry.

617
00:26:09,513 --> 00:26:12,336
So I renamed it
the Secret Sea.

618
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:15,157
Right, the fourth...
The fourth "Fillory" book.

619

have a copy here.

- That must be valuable.
- Yes.

00:26:24,454 --> 00:26:25,607
Well...

624
00:26:25,748 --> 00:26:27,621
even more so now.

The Watcherwoman
in the books,

627
00:26:33,911 --> 00:26:36,372
she was...

628
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,472
trying to steal all of magic
for herself, right?

629
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,879
And then...
And then Martin stops her.

630
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:42,948
Most of that book
is pure tosh.

631
00:26:43,036 --> 00:26:45,925
I had to invent that plot
from the whole class.

632
00:26:46,013 --> 00:26:49,823
It's... well, I couldn't exactly
publish the stories

633
00:26:49,911 --> 00:26:51,948
as the children
told them to me, could I?

634
00:26:52,036 --> 00:26:53,487
I mean, the "Flying Forest,"

635
00:26:53,575 --> 00:26:57,333
where the Chatwins discovered
recreational drug use?

636
00:26:57,559 --> 00:27:01,706
Poor little Jane hearing about
the birds and the bees from a...

637
00:27:01,794 --> 00:27:05,096
Did you know that centaurs
view necrophilia

638
00:27:05,184 --> 00:27:07,153
as a way of honoring the dead?

639
00:27:07,241 --> 00:27:09,235
Don't think I'd get
a Carnegie Medal

640
00:27:09,323 --> 00:27:11,419
for explaining that
to children.

641
00:27:11,526 --> 00:27:12,901
I mean, then there's all the...

642
00:27:12,989 --> 00:27:15,342
All the exaggerations
and the lies.

643
00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:19,598
I mean, Martin slaying
a dozen mercenaries,

644
00:27:19,934 --> 00:27:21,745
and Jane riding
on top of a horse,

645
00:27:21,833 --> 00:27:23,854
what, 100 feet tall?

646
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:25,286
I mean, what did she call it?

647
00:27:25,469 --> 00:27:27,532
- Cozy Horse.
- "Cozy Horse."

Utter nonsense
thrown in there

649
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:32,309
just to see how much
they'd get me to believe,

650
00:27:32,469 --> 00:27:34,526
and then Jane insisted
I keep it.

651
00:27:34,614 --> 00:27:37,878
In real life, the ending was...
Was much darker.

652
00:27:37,966 --> 00:27:40,839
Oh, Martin did stop
the Watcherwoman, that's true.

653
00:27:40,927 --> 00:27:43,392
The Secret Sea was built

654
00:27:43,479 --> 00:27:45,382
by the 13th king of Fillory

655
00:27:45,469 --> 00:27:47,768
to consolidate power
for himself.

656
00:27:47,856 --> 00:27:51,322
Martin wanted to make sure
that no one ever tried

657
00:27:51,409 --> 00:27:54,862
to do the same thing again
so he drained the Secret Sea,

658
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,966
using the last few drops
to set a trap

659
00:27:58,059 --> 00:28:00,755
for anyone who might
one day try to refill it.

660
00:28:00,856 --> 00:28:02,823
A... a curse.

661
00:28:02,911 --> 00:28:05,332
Right, so now one
of our friends is a fish.

662
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:08,184
[laughs]
Well, he was 13 at the time.

663
00:28:08,303 --> 00:28:09,596
You have to forgive

664
00:28:09,684 --> 00:28:12,239
his rather adolescent
sense of humor.

665
00:28:12,327 --> 00:28:14,250
- You know how to fix it?
- Mm-hmm.

666
00:28:14,415 --> 00:28:16,966
There's a garden
just outside the reservoir.

667
00:28:17,054 --> 00:28:19,987
The Drowned Garden,
Martin called it.

668
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:22,106
Never did know why.

669
00:28:22,454 --> 00:28:24,694
It reacts to your emotions.

670
00:28:25,389 --> 00:28:27,725
If you're happy,
a flower blooms.

671
00:28:27,813 --> 00:28:30,016
If you're sad, another one.

672
00:28:30,104 --> 00:28:32,647
So one of the plants
is the antidote?

673
00:28:32,735 --> 00:28:34,211
Indeed.

674
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:37,360
To make it bloom...

675
00:28:38,055 --> 00:28:41,313
you have to truly love Fillory.

676
00:28:46,598 --> 00:28:48,829
Maybe when I was 12, but...

677
00:28:49,946 --> 00:28:52,301
I don't know,
Fillory's taken away

678
00:28:52,389 --> 00:28:53,561
a lot of the shit I love.

679
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,977
Martin had the same problem.

680
00:28:56,459 --> 00:28:58,696
He returned as an adult and...

681
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,500
could not make
the flower bloom.

682
00:29:02,102 --> 00:29:04,821
His innocent love for Fillory

683
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,522
had... had soured.

684
00:29:07,609 --> 00:29:09,682
Think we can all say why.

685
00:29:10,135 --> 00:29:11,510

686
00:29:13,459 --> 00:29:15,432
It has to be you.

00:29:16,642 --> 00:29:18,643
I'm familiar with your books.

688
00:29:19,103 --> 00:29:22,143
Even considering
your recent experiences,

689
00:29:22,499 --> 00:29:24,885
Quentin has
the best chance of...

00:29:25,650 --> 00:29:27,557

the Library uses

before it's too late.

there's a life after death
