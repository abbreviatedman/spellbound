1
00:00:01,068 --> 00:00:02,593
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:05,639
A huge reservoir of magic,
hidden underneath the castle?

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,142
Where does it lead? To
Roderick's secret chamber?

4
00:00:09,209 --> 00:00:10,768
The Binder had a theory.

5
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:14,076
When a being of great
power, such as a god, is killed,

6
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,274
their energy is lost.

7
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,841
But he believed it
could be preserved,

8
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:20,318
effectively turning the
magician into a god.

9
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,822
Oh, thank Christ. I
didn't think I'd get through.

10
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,416
Listen, I don't have a lot
of time. We need your help.

11
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:26,994
Surviving first-year students,

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,689
I am here to teach
you what not to do.

13
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:32,358
The Library, they don't
want you to know it.

14
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:33,559
Before we go in,

15
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,636
there's a small
matter of protection.

16
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,136
What is it? Insects.

17
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:40,140
The bugs only last an
hour, so we need to be quick.

18
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,800
Everett's been
lying to all of us.

19
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:42,875
To do what?

20
00:00:43,343 --> 00:00:44,504
To become a god.

21
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:47,047
It's locked. Don't
you have the key?

22
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:48,308
Someone locked us in.

23
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:49,975
Who's dying? My sister.

24
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,576
I found her a body,
but I need to find one

25
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:55,554
that is more durable.

26
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:57,557
Like yours.

27
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:12,068
No running away, little not-god.

28
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:15,472
I'd hate to damage
my sister's new body.

29
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,105
Good news, sister.

30
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:20,771
I have found you

31
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:24,283
a much more durable body.

32
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:26,046
But I am going to have

33
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:28,520
to momentarily kill you again.

34
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:36,052
I beseech you, Our
Lady Underground.

35
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:42,129
You know what, fuck this.

36
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:43,863
You said you chose me,

37
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,701
so now's your
chance to prove it.

38
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,469
Julia.

39
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:55,612
Kinda cutting it
close, don't you think?

40
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,310
I didn't come here to fix it.

41
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:58,817
I can't.

42
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,319
You still have a chance.

43
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,446
A choice of what you want to be.

44
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:05,924
You're saying this whole time
me being a human and a god,

45
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:07,723
this was all just a test?

46
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:09,662
Well...

47
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:11,755
Both options are shit.

48
00:02:11,832 --> 00:02:15,064
I mean, you're saying
one is pass and one is fail?

49
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,969
You will not fail as long
as the decision is yours.

50
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:20,701
Now go, I can only
hold him for so long.

51
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:23,568
Oh, shit. OLU: Run!

52
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,469
Jesus Christ, so The
Monster took Julia.

53
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,838
We need to find them.
Do something now.

54
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:56,352
We have the axes
and the demon bottles.

55
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:58,345
You have the incorporate bond.

56
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:00,141
You didn't give two wet shits

57
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:02,011
when it was Eliot's
life on the line,

58
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:04,778
and now that it's Julia
you're suddenly leaning in?

59
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,615
Look, we all care
about both of them,

60
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,417
but based on
Mayakovsky's formula

61
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,889
casting an incorporate bond
strong enough to hold a god

62
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:13,017
would take an insane
amount of power.

63
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,321
Now we need twice as much.

64
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,226
If we go in there
without enough juice

65
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:17,820
they'll just body hop.

66
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:19,867
They'll kill us all. Great.

67
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,336
Where the hell are we
gonna find that kind of magic?

68
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,797
Hey, Dean.

69
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,671
I would not go in your
office right now, if I were you.

70
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,836
If you shit in my
private bathroom again...

71
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:32,209
No. Well, see,

72
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:35,374
there's kind of a few Librarian
dudes here to arrest you.

73
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:38,850
Yeah, they're pretty pissed
about some lecture you gave

74
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:41,218
while you were pissed.

75
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,916
I've been expecting
them. Come with me.

76
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,857
Thank Christ I wore
the right suit today.

77
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,559
The right suit for
being arrested, or...

78
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:56,335
Wait. Are you still drunk?

79
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,338
That's entirely
beside the point.

80
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,600
We have a bigger problem.

81
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:01,786
Kady and Zelda haven't
returned from the Poison Room,

82
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:03,208
and they're running out of time.

83
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,036
Oh, shit.

84
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,839
Who are they, and what
does that mean, exactly?

85
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,406
God damn it, focus, Todd. Yes.

86
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:11,894
If I'm going to be arrested,
there still may be a chance

87
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,386
that something good
can come from it.

88
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:14,512
Here.

89
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:19,919
Yes, here.

90
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,866
Take this to the Library
book drop immediately.

91
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,005
Tell no one, do you understand?

92
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,624
Sure, keep it confidench. On it.

93
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:28,361
And try not to "Todd" this up.

94
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,697
I will try not to be myself.

95
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,519
Well, so much for
getting Fogg's help.

96
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:58,698
Well, that's the last
of our protection.

97
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,459
On the upside,
tasted minty fresh.

98
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:04,570
Hmm.

99
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,937
Let's go.

100
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,176
Wait.

101
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,508
What the hell?

102
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:25,655
Hello, there.

103
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,422
Apologies, I was
trying not to startle you.

104
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,862
Christopher Plover. Pleasure.

105
00:05:30,964 --> 00:05:32,990
The children's book author?

106
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:34,967
Oh, you're familiar
with my work.

107
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,035
You could say that.

108
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:37,764
I've read Martin Chatwin's book.

109
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:41,172
Yes, well, not exactly
the highlight of my <i>oeuvre.</i>

110
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:44,210
You're the pervert who
turned him into The Beast.

111
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:47,406
I'm the man who survived
in this place for weeks.

112
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:50,074
And I can show you how

113
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,982
if you help me escape.

114
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:58,055
Look, it sucks that
Fogg's out of commish,

115
00:05:58,158 --> 00:05:59,649
but who else can we shake down?

116
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,957
Kady was trying to find
the Library stockpile.

117
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,553
If we knew where that was.

118
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:05,655
Found magic, need help!

119
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:06,893
Who sent you?

120
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,333
Found magic, need
help! Okay, where?

121
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,371
Vague as shit. Oh, sorry.

122
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:12,734
It's Fen.

123
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:18,505
Right this way.

124
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:20,337
High King Fen awaits.

125
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:35,728
Whoa.

126
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:46,773
Sort of incredible.

127
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,569
Trippy.

128
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:50,907
Oh, good, you're here.

129
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:54,846
Fen, what is this? And
what's with the fish?

130
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,111
Follow me, come on.

131
00:07:04,224 --> 00:07:07,558
Holy shit.

132
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:09,493
This is the reservoir?

133
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,292
An ocean of pure magic.

134
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:13,424
Pretty amazing, right?

135
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,736
I found it. Well, Josh and me.

136
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,293
And Tick was there too, I guess.

137
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:19,805
But, no, a lot of it was me.

138
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,971
One small problem...

139
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:24,305
don't touch it!

140
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:26,346
That's the tiny little problem.

141
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,746
It seems to be protected
by some sort of curse.

142
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,685
Look what it did to Josh.

143
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,454
<i>You're saying Josh
is a fucking fish?</i>

144
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:38,457
Well, of course not. He's
a Fillorian Dying Fish.

145
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:39,788
A Fillorian Fucking Fish

146
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,885
is a totally different species.

147
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,988
Wait, "Dying Fish"?

148
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:46,123
I really hope that's a metaphor.

149
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:49,134
Nope, they only
live a couple days.

150
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,136
And you're sure that's Josh?

151
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:52,467
Oh, I saw it happen.

152
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:54,735
We were gonna come
straight to you guys,

153
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,936
tell you all about
how we saved the day,

154
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,947
and then he touches the water
and next thing I know, boom,

155
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,380
Josh Fish.

156
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,781
Him and his damn showmanship.

157
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,620
So is it bad if it turns white?

158
00:08:07,687 --> 00:08:09,781
Great Umber's taint.

159
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,154
What are you doing?

160
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:13,658
Dying Fish need eye contact,

161
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,126
almost constantly.

162
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:19,125
Usually they get it from their
fish moms, but we'll have to fill in.

163
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,692
Every pet I ever had ended
up in a shoebox or the toilet.

164
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:25,101
This one's all you. It's
just until we figure out

165
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,605
how to turn him
back into a person.

166
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,538
Or the rest of his life.

167
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,234
I'm not babysitting Nemo

168
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,778
when we're this
close to saving Eliot.

169
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,616
I've got bigger fish to fry.
- Shh, Margo!

170
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,482
Don't say "fry" and "fish."

171
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:45,219
It's not working. He's
not getting better.

172
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:48,557
Margo, please. For Josh?

173
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,527
Damn it.

174
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,693
So I just look at him?

175
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,701
My Gods.

176
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:02,333
He perked right up.

177
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,911
He's bonded to you.

178
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,580
He thinks you're his mother.

179
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,016
Unfortunately, that's not
the first time that's happened.

180
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,519
Closest thing to the
reservoir in the books

181
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:17,818
is the Secret Sea.

182
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,553
It's an underground ocean.

183
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,059
Chatwins sailed across it

184
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:24,563
with a crew full
of rabbit pirates.

185
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:26,657
Are those pirates
who steal rabbits,

186
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:27,928
or pirates who are rabbits?

187
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,034
Kind of both.

188
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:31,162
But it doesn't say anything

189
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,071
about the Secret Sea
being full of magic or cursed,

190
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,974
so maybe there's a
clue that I'm missing.

191
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,706
And if your nerdy
bullshit leads us nowhere?

192
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:40,906
We need a backup plan.

193
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:43,813
Speaking of bunnies, where
are the ones that Fen sent?

194
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,249
I have an idea.

195
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,981
So do all rabbits talk, or...

196
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,183
Some of them you have
to bribe with cigarettes first.

197
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,725
Look, about my message...

198
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:54,283
No, I know. I owe you.

199
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:55,885
But I can't slip you

200
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,022
that kind of power
behind The Order's back.

201
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,862
The monsters have
two of my friends,

202
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,402
and who knows what kind
of chaos they're causing

203
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:03,960
while the Library does nothing.

204
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,265
Look, Alice...

205
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:09,164
I am no stranger to
messing up a good thing.

206
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,074
I'm not gonna do
that with the Library.

207
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:15,240
Well, if we don't do something,
there might not be a Library anymore.

208
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:16,613
Then why don't you work with us?

209
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:19,413
Because your bosses
would arrest all of us on sight.

210
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:20,818
You wanna do some good?

211
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,786
This is your best chance.

212
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,454
I hope you find
what you need, Alice.

213
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:32,718
We're not setting him loose.

214
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,826
All we're promising is to take
him with us if we find an exit.

215
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,062
Well?

216
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,106
Do we have a deal?

217
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,438
Moss?

218
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:49,574
My theory is it
counteracts the poison.

219
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,584
Probably why it's the
only other living thing

220
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,142
in this place.

221
00:10:53,453 --> 00:10:56,013
Been eating it since I got here

222
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:57,681
and I'm as healthy as a horse.

223
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,055
How did you get here?

224
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:02,625
Former prisoner of yours,

225
00:11:02,695 --> 00:11:04,755
Alice Quinn,

226
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,699
seemed to think this was
the place I deserved to be.

227
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,530
I can't say I disagree.

228
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:12,504
Don't bite the hand
that feeds you, dear.

229
00:11:12,772 --> 00:11:14,172
Shall we?

230
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,517
Huh.

231
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,951
At least give me my dignity.

232
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,752
Sorry. Protocol.

233
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:34,588
Well, this was a new suit.

234
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:36,824
It's a bit loud.

235
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:38,831
Yes.

236
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,134
It certainly is.

237
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,088
Damn, the history of this
place is depressing as shit.

238
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:05,522
Most world histories are.

239
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,218
Nothing about a way out.

240
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:10,227
Kady?

241
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,255
Oh, shit.

242
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,259
What?

243
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:18,668
The moss should have
protected you from...

244
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:23,200
Oh. "Oh," what?

245
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,779
The age-suspension spells

246
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:28,712
Martin used to keep me
alive while he tortured me,

247
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:30,875
it must still be
keeping me alive.

248
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,077
Perfect.

249
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:35,121
So I'm gonna die in the
most ironic way possible.

250
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:36,951
Just like Penny.

251
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,757
Well...

252
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,388
Not necessarily.

253
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:45,424
If we get back in time...

254
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,801
Wait,

255
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:52,336
all this time

256
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:54,603
the Library had a cure?

257
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:56,801
Kady... No, you...

258
00:12:56,909 --> 00:13:00,437
you chose not to save Penny?

259
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:02,379
If it were up to me... It was.

260
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,246
It's called "The Poison Room."

261
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:06,411
The name is a warning
Penny chose to ignore.

262
00:13:06,486 --> 00:13:09,115
No, no, no, you don't get
to hide behind the Library.

263
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:11,953
You think if you're a
cog in a fascist machine

264
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:15,018
that you're not responsible
for the people that it kills?

265
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,528
I'll admit, the Library veered

266
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,098
in an authoritarian direction.

267
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,862
Because of Everett. Once
we remove him from power...

268
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,664
No, no, it is not just Everett.

269
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,932
It's the whole goddamn Order.

270
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:28,474
It all needs to be burned down.

271
00:13:28,574 --> 00:13:30,873
Not if it can be reformed.

272
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,970
Look, as someone
who lived through

273
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35,743
two world wars, I can tell you,

274
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,011
authoritarian regimes,
they fail eventually.

275
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:39,117
See?

276
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:40,362
Look, even the
pedophile agrees with me.

277
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,287
Oh, hardly.

278
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:45,251
Problem is,

279
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,851
no one will ever let you change.

280
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,657
People always see you
for what you've done,

281
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,254
never for who you are.

282
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,062
So at the end of the day,

283
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,344
no matter what
you try to become,

284
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:56,961
some judgmental blonde bitch

285
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:59,130
always shoves you
down a poison well.

286
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:00,969
Yeah?

287
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,809
Well, then I'm
Team Blonde Bitch.

288
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,586
Where's Fen? I sent
her out for fish flakes

289
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,155
three hours ago.

290
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:19,021
Wait, you sent her out
alone in Manhattan?

291
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:22,085
Well, I kind of implied it
was her fault Josh was a fish

292
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,528
and blah, blah, blah,
I'd blame her forever,

293
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,326
so she's cooling
off at Benihana.

294
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,527
She never could
resist a sharp knife.

295
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:33,630
Meanwhile, I'm trying to
read up on a damn cure

296
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,904
while maintaining constant
eye contact with an anchovy.

297
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,111
And they say girls are
the ones who get needy

298
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,510
once you fuck them.

299
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,373
Wait, were you and Josh...

300
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:44,507
Wait, you know about

301
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:47,247
the werewolf stuff, right?

302
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,046
Who gives a shit?

303
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,021
Nothing matters. Okay.

304
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,559
Look, it's not a
big deal, all right?

305
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,727
Sometimes we bang.
He makes me laugh.

306
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,320
And I like having him around

307
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,957
'cause of the
aforementioned banging,

308
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,161
and he just you know, he
kind of gets me. So what?

309
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,637
It's not like I'm in love
with Josh Hoberman.

310
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,969
It kinda sounds
like you are, though.

311
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:12,075
Have you met me?
I don't do feelings.

312
00:15:13,179 --> 00:15:15,375
I'm the bitch with the ice axes.

313
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:17,383
You can still care about a guy,

314
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:20,352
werewolf, fish.

315
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,889
And it doesn't make
you any less you.

316
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,584
I mean, you can still
be a bitch if you want to.

317
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:28,420
Hmm. Shit.

318
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:32,927
Maybe I do love
this goddamn guppy.

319
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:37,501
Uh, I think this is
the Hedge doctor

320
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,231
that Kady called to fix Pete.

321
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,637
Says he's a veterinarian.

322
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,606
Maybe he can help
with the fish-Josh.

323
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,006
Josh-fish.

324
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,443
Way to be useful, Coldwater.

325
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,145
Is this Gordy?

326
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,947
Yeah, I've got fish problems.

327
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:00,784
Josh and Margo. Yeah.

328
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,502
Okay, here's my thing,

329
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:12,604
um...

330
00:16:14,774 --> 00:16:17,369
I didn't think that I could
ever trust you again.

331
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:21,537
And now...

332
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:23,681
"And now"?

333
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,352
I find myself wanting to.

334
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,636
When we first met,

335
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:46,468
I was clinging onto some

336
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:51,474
naive, idealistic notions of
what the world should be.

337
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:55,140
How people should be.

338
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,345
And I think that I have realized

339
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,718
if I just throw away
all that childish bullshit,

340
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:08,056
I can forgive people.

341
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:14,031
For not living up to
my stupid expectations.

342
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,033
Like yourself?

343
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,701
What if we try again?

344
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:30,081
I want you in my life, Alice.

345
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,242
I want that, too.

346
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,260
Cyrus.

347
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:50,435
There was an intrusion
in the Poison Room.

348
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,664
It's Zelda.

349
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,139
With a hedge witch.

350
00:17:56,709 --> 00:18:00,339
Did you follow protocol?
Yes, they're locked in.

351
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,016
But do we really just
leave her to die in there?

352
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,320
How long do you think we have?

353
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,422
If we got out now? A few days.

354
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:24,259
In here? A few hours.

355
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,302
The after-effects of
the bugs slowed the...

356
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,808
Zelda? Shit.

357
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,448
Sorry to knock
you out like that.

358
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:45,116
It's the only way we could talk.

359
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,726
You could have freed me.

360
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,463
You brought a hedge witch

361
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,095
into our most protected archive.

362
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:02,198
I read your book.
You're hoarding magic.

363
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,107
Trying to become a god. Why?

364
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:06,475
I put in centuries of work

365
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:08,514
before you ever knew
the Library existed.

366
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:11,675
Oh, so I wouldn't understand.
No, you should understand.

367
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,810
How...

368
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,785
futile it all is.

369
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:18,552
We work so hard to protect
the flame of knowledge,

370
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:21,753
but there will always be
things we can't understand.

371
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:23,389
Knowledge of the Gods.

372
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,989
By becoming one of them, I can
rip their secrets away from them

373
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,829
and bring them
back to the Library.

374
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,232
At what cost?

375
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:33,170
An unkillable god is on
the loose as we speak.

376
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,503
In the body of Eliot Waugh.

377
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:37,841
You intend to take his power.

378
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:40,572
He has the power
to destroy everything,

379
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,546
and all we have are books.

380
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,241
If we want to face
that kind of threat,

381
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,478
we need power, too.

382
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:03,129
Isn't that what Bacchus and
the others were trying to do?

383
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,693
They got drunk
on their own power.

384
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,204
Some of them literally.

385
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:08,901
What makes you think you
won't fall prey to the same hubris?

386
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:11,034
Well, I thought I had you.

387
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:19,277
Excuse me, but isn't
this book banned?

388
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,877
Like, really, really banned?

389
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:23,756
Fuck me. Uh,

390
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,518
we need to get that
to the Poison Room.

391
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:29,255
Immediately. Now, now, now.

392
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,156
You wanted me.

393
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,299
To do what, exactly?

394
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:09,932
To take over the
Library once I'm gone.

395
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,329
To see to the human concerns,

396
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:14,702
and to fix my mistakes

397
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:18,909
with the benefit of all the knowledge
and the power I would bring.

398
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:21,305
I wish you'd told
me the truth sooner.

399
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,504
So do I.

400
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,418
So, do what you must.

401
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,185
Follow protocol. There is
a way you can still help me.

402
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:35,587
I redirected the power
I need into a reservoir,

403
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,721
but it triggered
a protective spell.

404
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,163
A puzzle I can't solve.

405
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:41,091
But I've discovered
someone who can.

406
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,729
Quentin Coldwater.

407
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:46,064
Get Quentin to
open the reservoir,

408
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,164
and the Library can
still be yours to lead if...

409
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:51,433
Did you slap me?

410
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:54,140
We need to move, fast.

411
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:58,346
No. I didn't risk my life
to save a child molester.

412
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,976
He can stay. What? No.

413
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,385
We Had a deal! Tell him!

414
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,923
Well, your moss didn't
do shit for us, so...

415
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,928
But I can help you
get to the reservoir.

416
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:16,128
It was a secret of Martin's,
and I know all his secrets.

417
00:22:16,936 --> 00:22:19,167
I could share them with you.

418
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:29,111
Incursion protocol.
They're patrolling.

419
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:30,548
Come on.

420
00:22:36,388 --> 00:22:37,428
Get to the Earth fountain,

421
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:38,855
I'll hold them off. Go!

422
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:51,195
Damn it.

423
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,165
Quite a trip you sent me on.

424
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,233
You ruined my suit.

425
00:22:58,344 --> 00:22:59,505
But the good news is,

426
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:02,738
you're just about my size.

427
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,580
Keep barking, you
schnauzer fuck.

428
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:12,988
It won't bring back your balls.

429
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,890
God, I hate animals.

430
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:18,029
So...

431
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,559
Goldfish troubles? Not exactly.

432
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:27,898
I see. Not a goldfish.
Some kind of hybrid?

433
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:29,339
Oh, my God.

434
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:32,011
I am sorry to be the
bearer of bad news,

435
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,410
but your fish is a werewolf.

436
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,214
Wait. So are you.

437
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:40,478
Did...

438
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,077
Did you fuck this fish?

439
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:45,051
Look, he's a human
who's been cursed,

440
00:23:45,124 --> 00:23:46,752
and I need to
know how to undo it.

441
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:49,419
Well, it's definitely
not a hedge spell.

442
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:50,895
And without knowing
how it was cast,

443
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,592
not much I can do about it.

444
00:23:52,665 --> 00:23:54,376
So, should I just go
ahead and flush it, or...

445
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,335
Again, he's a person.

446
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:59,003
I'm gonna need you to
try a little harder, all right?

447
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,437
Now, if I look away
for literally 10 seconds,

448
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,066
he starts to die, and at some
point, I'm gonna need to sleep

449
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:06,772
or drop a deuce, and I
don't allow spectators.

450
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:12,407
Yeah, there is some kind
of bond happening there.

451
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:16,580
Whoa. Your eye is crazy.

452
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,647
Is that a wolf thing, or...

453
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:20,423
Fairy thing.

454
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:22,222
Can we focus on
fish boy, please?

455
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,990
It's not even
attached to your head.

456
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,954
You ever pop it out?

457
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:28,728
Why the shit would I pop
out my own eyeball, Gordy?

458
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:33,169
So you can point it
at your gilled lover

459
00:24:33,272 --> 00:24:37,334
while you attend
to lady business.

460
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,680
I don't know, man. It
feels pretty stuck in there.

461
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,486
Ahh!

462
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:55,117
Holy shit, it's working.

463
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:56,685
I can still see out of it.

464
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:59,788
You ever touch me
again, I'll pop out your balls.

465
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:03,034
Uh...

466
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,506
See? Problem solved.

467
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:14,872
I don't know. This
seems kind of problematic.

468
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,074
Oh, I got just the thing.

469
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,148
Really?

470
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:28,452
Why does a veterinarian have
a pirate-themed eye patch?

471
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:32,123
Maybe it's best we don't ask
a lot of follow-up questions.

472
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,434
Jesus, what happened to you?

473
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,535
Hey.

474
00:25:39,405 --> 00:25:40,668
Just... Hello, Alice.

475
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,817
Thought he was dead.
Why'd you bring him here?

476
00:25:42,841 --> 00:25:45,640
Because I just might
be the only person alive

477
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:47,737
who knows how to
access the reservoir

478
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:48,846
and save your friends.

479
00:25:51,617 --> 00:25:54,348
Mmm. Okay, so, the reservoir.

480
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,685
Yes, well, that's
what Martin called it.

481
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:00,215
I thought it lacked
a certain poetry.

482
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:03,419
So I renamed it the Secret Sea.

483
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,531
Right, the fourth <i>Fillory</i> book.

484
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:08,294
Mmm. Oh, I see
you have a copy here.

485
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:10,935
Ah.

486
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:12,036
Oh.

487
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,238
First edition That
must be valuable. Yes.

488
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:19,506
Well, even more so now.

489
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:26,549
The Watcher Woman in the books,

490
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:29,554
she was trying to steal all
of magic for herself, right?

491
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:31,112
And then Martin stops her.

492
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:34,091
Most of that book is pure tosh.

493
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,152
I had to invent that
plot from whole cloth

494
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,262
since, well,

495
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:41,027
I couldn't exactly
publish the stories

496
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,069
as the children told
them to me, could I?

497
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:44,763
I mean, the Flying Forest,

498
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:47,635
where the Chatwins
discovered recreational drug use?

499
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:51,242
Poor little Jane hearing
all about the birds

500
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,403
and the bees from a...

501
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:56,275
Did you know that
centaurs view necrophilia

502
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:58,407
as a way of honoring the dead?

503
00:26:58,584 --> 00:27:00,280
Don't think I'd get
a Carnegie Medal

504
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:02,253
for explaining that to children.

505
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:06,691
I mean, then there's all the
exaggerations and the lies.

506
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:10,596
I mean, Martin slaying
a dozen mercenaries,

507
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:15,124
and Jane riding on top of
a horse, what, 100 feet tall?

508
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:17,260
I mean, what did she
call it? Cozy Horse.

509
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:20,932
"Cozy Horse." Utter
nonsense thrown in there

510
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:23,566
just to see how much
they'd get me to believe,

511
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,634
and then Jane
insisted I keep it.

512
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:29,044
In real life, the ending
was much darker.

513
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:31,947
Oh, Martin did stop the
Watcher Woman, that's true.

514
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:34,077
The Secret Sea

515
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,588
was built by the
thirteenth king of Fillory

516
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,749
to consolidate
power for himself.

517
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:42,027
Martin wanted to make
sure that no one ever tried

518
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:46,121
to do the same thing again
so he drained the Secret Sea

519
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:49,168
using the last few
drops to set a trap

520
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:52,170
for anyone who might,
one day, try to refill it.

521
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:53,705
A curse.

522
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:56,531
Right, so now, one
of our friends is a fish.

523
00:27:56,642 --> 00:27:59,544
Well, he was 13 at the time.

524
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:03,309
You have to forgive his rather
adolescent sense of humor.

525
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:04,441
You know how to fix it?

526
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,550
Mmm.

527
00:28:05,651 --> 00:28:08,143
There's a garden just
outside the reservoir.

528
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,985
The Drowned
Garden, Martin called it.

529
00:28:11,323 --> 00:28:12,791
Never did know why.

530
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,685
It reacts to your emotions.

531
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,024
You feel happy, a flower blooms.

532
00:28:19,097 --> 00:28:21,362
You feel sad, another one.

533
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,664
So, one of the
plants is the antidote?

534
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:25,163
Indeed.

535
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:29,233
To make it bloom,

536
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:32,072
you have to truly love Fillory.

537
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:39,915
Maybe when I was 12, but...

538
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:44,553
I don't know, Fillory's taken
away a lot of the shit I love.

539
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:46,852
Martin had the same problem.

540
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,194
He returned as an adult

541
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:52,356
and could not make
the flower bloom.

542
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:55,866
His innocent love for Fillory

543
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:58,699
had soured.

544
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,671
I think we can all say why.

545
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,899
Quentin.

546
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,272
It has to be you.

547
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:09,474
I'm familiar with your books.

548
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:13,314
Even considering your
recent experiences,

549
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,649
Quentin has the
best chance of...

550
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:19,050
making the garden grow.

551
00:29:23,729 --> 00:29:25,220
We don't have much time.

552
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:27,095
There's a contractor
the Library uses

553
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,258
who might be willing to...

554
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:29,733
Text me if you find somebody.

555
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:41,980
So it's true? The
Library has a cure?

556
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:44,974
I know, it's bullshit.

557
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:47,484
Go with her
before it's too late.

558
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:50,953
If this is some noble shit

559
00:29:51,056 --> 00:29:53,582
about you not owing
the Library anything...

560
00:29:57,429 --> 00:29:58,429
Oh.

561
00:29:58,497 --> 00:30:00,090
You don't want to be cured.

562
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:04,129
'Cause for all the terrible
shit we've been through,

563
00:30:04,236 --> 00:30:05,636
at least the upside is

564
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:07,464
that you know that
there's a life after death

565
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:09,839
and you get to spend
forever with the other Penny.

566
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:12,035
And what part of
that sounds bad?

567
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,306
The part where you're dead.

568
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:17,810
I may not know
you the way he did,

569
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:20,283
but I know that that
would be a hell of a waste.

570
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,580
Yeah.

571
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,754
Well, most things are.

572
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:34,529
A lot's changed
since I've been gone.

573
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:35,965
Yes.

574
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:39,002
The humans made
lots of good stuff.

575
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:42,536
They spend their small
lives building things

576
00:30:42,641 --> 00:30:45,475
that we could
smash in a heartbeat.

577
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:46,668
Sounds fun.

578
00:30:46,778 --> 00:30:49,111
Perhaps you can tell me...

579
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:50,809
Do I have a name?

580
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:54,282
Why would you need one?

581
00:30:56,288 --> 00:30:58,120
Starbucks, mostly.

582
00:30:58,557 --> 00:31:00,458
This whole time I
felt so sorry for you.

583
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,289
Lost and alone.

584
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:04,523
But you weren't alone.
You were with the humans.

585
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,389
You talk like them,
you think like them.

586
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:11,136
I ate a few of them.

587
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,968
Yes, but you care about them.

588
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:23,641
You think I'm disappointed.

589
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,047
I'm not.

590
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,215
Are you scared of
me, little brother?

591
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:33,315
Would I have worked
so hard to bring you back

592
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,452
if I was scared of you?

593
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:38,019
All I thought about was you.

594
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:42,229
After I remembered
you existed, anyway.

595
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:45,160
And all I thought
about was revenge.

596
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:48,163
And I got it for you already.

597
00:31:48,707 --> 00:31:50,869
I killed Bacchus.

598
00:31:50,942 --> 00:31:52,433
Iris.

599
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:54,573
All of them.

600
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:56,972
Everyone who hurt you.

601
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,348
The question is who put us here?

602
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,485
Our parents.

603
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:07,988
They made us,
called us mistakes.

604
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:09,356
Abandoned us.

605
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:12,421
So, what do we do?

606
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:14,890
I like murder as much as anyone,

607
00:32:14,966 --> 00:32:17,231
but I did all of this

608
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:19,362
just to be with you.

609
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:23,066
Can't we enjoy it
just for a little while?

610
00:32:24,643 --> 00:32:26,612
That's not what
we were made for.

611
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:31,046
It's not that I am terrified
of the Old Gods in any way.

612
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:33,415
It's just, how do you kill

613
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:36,216
an intangible thought creature?

614
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:38,257
Where do you even stab?

615
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:42,054
They're more
vulnerable than you think.

616
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,221
If we can get to their realm.

617
00:32:44,596 --> 00:32:46,394
Which we cannot.

618
00:32:46,932 --> 00:32:49,299
We have a key. A scroll.

619
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,369
Found it a very long
time ago on this world.

620
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:53,666
The Order took it from us.

621
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:55,934
They didn't even
know what they had.

622
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:57,305
Now,

623
00:32:57,375 --> 00:33:00,311
where would a
bunch of Librarians

624
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:04,247
keep a very, very
important scroll?

625
00:33:17,395 --> 00:33:18,419
Oh.

626
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:19,692
Here.

627
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:21,224
This has to be it.

628
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:23,968
It's exactly as
Martin described it.

629
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,472
Think happy thoughts

630
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:29,371
about Fillory.

631
00:33:29,474 --> 00:33:31,102
Pure.

632
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,906
Innocent.

633
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:35,644
Maybe try talking to it.

634
00:33:35,714 --> 00:33:37,239
Okay, can you just...

635
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,049
Well...

636
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,891
Um, Fillory is...

637
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:50,428
obviously great.

638
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:53,556
You know, talking bears, right?

639
00:33:53,665 --> 00:33:55,531
Who could hate that?

640
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:58,763
And opium in the air.

641
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,404
That was...

642
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,038
smart.

643
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:04,874
And...

644
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:08,380
socialized centaur medicine.

645
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,675
Are we screwed

646
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:12,377
because Quentin can't
get it up for Fillory? Just...

647
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:13,509
Look, why don't you try...

648
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:14,678
Okay, no, stop.

649
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:16,330
I can't... Look, you're
the one that ruined this.

650
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:17,498
I can't do it with you
over my shoulder,

651
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:19,616
so just, please, just go.

652
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:24,928
God damn it.

653
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,434
Okay, um...

654
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,009
When I was a kid, I
loved the Fizzy River

655
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,977
that they found in book two.

656
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,546
And I loved...

657
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,216
I loved the Upside-Down Desert.

658
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:46,217
You know, the...

659
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:48,713
I can't really picture it,
but, you know, it sounds...

660
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:51,249
It sounds cool.

661
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,751
I don't know, I
can't, I'm sorry.

662
00:34:56,861 --> 00:35:00,161
I just... I can't... Hey. Hey.

663
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,669
I used to love Fillory
when I was a kid

664
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,896
because I didn't
know what it was.

665
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:09,139
Plover left out all
of the terrible shit,

666
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,232
and most of the good
stuff he just made up.

667
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:14,578
Even the fucking
Cozy Horse is a lie.

668
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,005
Remember what you told me

669
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,015
about letting go of
who you used to be?

670
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:20,113
I know, I'm trying.

671
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:21,380
Don't.

672
00:35:22,988 --> 00:35:24,479
I don't want you to.

673
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:28,188
Believing in something,
really believing,

674
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:30,228
is almost impossible.

675
00:35:32,564 --> 00:35:34,624
But the Quentin I first met...

676
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,296
he believed in magic.

677
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:39,931
And in Fillory.

678
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:42,233
He changed.

679
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,405
He grew up.

680
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:48,570
Being an adult doesn't mean
that you have to throw away

681
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:50,115
what you used to love.

682
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:52,845
Then what does it mean?

683
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,280
Seeing the world
through new eyes.

684
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:04,860
And for what it's worth,

685
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:06,826
the Cozy Horse is real.

686
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:08,332
I saw her when I was a Niffin.

687
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,795
So big you could
build a house on it.

688
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:13,933
So...

689
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,708
Let's go.

690
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,521
Okay, it's just you and me.

691
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:41,196
You know the worst part

692
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:43,063
of getting exactly
what you want?

693
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:48,572
When it's not good enough.

694
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:53,173
Then what do you do?

695
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,482
If this can't make me
happy, then what would?

696
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:06,354
Fillory was supposed
to mean something.

697
00:37:07,826 --> 00:37:11,160
I was supposed to
mean something here.

698
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:15,465
But it's all... It's
just... It's random.

699
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:18,503
It's so random that the
only way to save my friends

700
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,869
is to yell at a fucking plant!

701
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:28,244
Honestly, fuck Fillory
for being so disappointing.

702
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:31,821
You know what,
maybe I was better off

703
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,876
just believing
that it was fiction.

704
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:37,948
The idea of Fillory

705
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:40,082
is what saved my life!

706
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:46,254
This promise...

707
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:49,432
that...

708
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:52,934
people like me...

709
00:37:55,974 --> 00:37:58,443
People like me...

710
00:37:59,511 --> 00:38:01,742
Can somehow...

711
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:06,240
Find an escape.

712
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,317
There has gotta be
some power in that.

713
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:19,898
Shouldn't loving the
idea of Fillory be enough?

714
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:47,454
Guys.

715
00:38:50,195 --> 00:38:52,755
Guys, something's happening!

716
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:18,985
Here's the door.

717
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:03,592
The key to the realm
of the Old Gods.

718
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:35,193
How the hell does
this thing work?

719
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:39,935
Give this to Margo.

720
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:42,036
If Plover's right, it
should cure Josh.

721
00:40:43,074 --> 00:40:44,906
Monsters in Library!

722
00:40:49,147 --> 00:40:51,673
Sheila must have sent
it. Monsters in Library!

723
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,463
All right, we have to
go before they leave.

724
00:40:53,518 --> 00:40:55,043
Okay, I'll grab
Margo and the axes.

725
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,519
Hey, you sure
this is gonna work?

726
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:57,748
Well, either it will,

727
00:40:57,822 --> 00:40:59,586
or when you come
back we'll both be fish.

728
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,726
Well, that'd be an improvement.

729
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:08,729
Okay. Okay.

730
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,938
Do you feel anything?

731
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:15,839
Super stressed out?

732
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:18,074
Okay.

733
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:23,077
Ugh.

734
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:26,682
Yeah, I'm totally feeling that.

735
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,808
Okay.

736
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:33,290
Grab your axes.

737
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:34,917
Monsters in the Library.

738
00:41:36,094 --> 00:41:37,289
Are you baking for a fish?

739
00:41:37,362 --> 00:41:38,990
He has a refined palate.

740
00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:40,975
Yeah, here, this should
fix the whole fish deal.

741
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:42,763
And, yes, I noticed

742
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:44,912
that your eyeball isn't in your head,
but honestly, we do not have time

743
00:41:44,936 --> 00:41:45,995
for me to hear that story.

744
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:47,970
How long does the
leaf take? I don't know.

745
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:50,031
But you know it works?

746
00:41:52,777 --> 00:41:54,609
I can't believe I'm saying this,

747
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,545
but I can't go until he's cured.

748
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:58,874
If I leave, Josh will die.

749
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:00,679
It's okay. Penny.

750
00:42:01,386 --> 00:42:02,718
I'll bring Eliot back.

751
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,844
I promise.

752
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,188
Damn cheap bastards.

753
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,629
No, no, please!

754
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,825
No!

755
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:16,631
Shit.

756
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:28,177
What did you do to
get locked in this cage?

757
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:31,081
Well, I...

758
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:34,584
I went against
every instinct I had.

759
00:42:35,086 --> 00:42:37,885
I tried to make a
goddamn difference.

760
00:42:38,156 --> 00:42:40,785
Which, for the record,
you should never, ever do.

761
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:46,095
Julia...

762
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:49,094
if you're in there,

763
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,593
then I'm sorry...

764
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:54,839
for everything that
happened to you...

765
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:57,098
Because of me.

766
00:42:57,442 --> 00:42:59,274
Hey, Monster...

767
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:01,072
Lady.

768
00:43:15,126 --> 00:43:16,355
Adorable.
