<i>Previously on</i>
The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:05,628
A huge reservoir of magic,
hidden underneath the castle?

3
00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:09,124
- Where does it lead?
- To Roderick's secret chamber?

4
00:00:09,218 --> 00:00:10,754
The Binder had a theory.

5
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:14,087
When a being of great power,
such as a god, is killed,

6
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,262
their energy is lost.

7
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,841
But he believed
it could be preserved,

8
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:20,302
effectively turning
the magician into a god.

9
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,808
Oh, thank Christ.
I didn't think I'd get through.

10
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:25,436
Listen, I don't have a lot
of time. We need your help.

11
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:26,983
Surviving
first-year students,

12
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:29,686
I am here to teach you
what not to do.

13
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:32,363
The Library, they don't
want you to know it.

14
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,565
Before we go in,

15
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:35,616
there's a small matter
of protection.

16
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,113
- What is it?
- Insects.

17
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:40,117
The bugs only last an hour,
so we need to be quick.

18
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,789
Everett's been lying
to all of us.

19
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:42,875
To do what?

20
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:44,496
To become a god.

21
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:47,044
- It's locked.
- Don't you have the key?

22
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,291
Someone locked us in.

23
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:49,964
- Who's dying?
- My sister.

24
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,588
I found her a body,
but I need to find one

25
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:55,546
that is more durable.

26
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,551
Like yours.

27
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:12,066
No running away,
little not-god.

28
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:15,489
I'd hate to damage
my sister's new body.

29
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,110
Good news, sister.

30
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,786
I have found you

31
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:24,286
a much more durable body.

32
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:26,038
But I am going to have

33
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:28,495
to momentarily kill you again.

34
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:36,044
I beseech you,
Our Lady Underground.

35
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,137
You know what, fuck this.

36
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,843
You said you chose me,

37
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,678
so now's your chance
to prove it.

38
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,473
Julia.

39
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:55,609
Kinda cutting it close,
don't you think?

40
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:57,315
I didn't come here to fix it.

41
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:58,820
I can't.

42
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,321
You still have a chance.

43
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:02,449
A choice of what
you want to be.

44
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,907
You're saying this whole time
me being a human and a god,

45
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,708
this was all just a test?

46
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,670
Well...

47
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,747
Both options are shit.

48
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,049
I mean, you're saying
one is pass and one is fail?

49
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:17,969
You will not fail as long
as the decision is yours.

50
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:20,718
Now go, I can only
hold him for so long.

51
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:23,554
- Oh, shit.
- Run!

52
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,457
Jesus Christ,
so The Monster took Julia.

53
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,834
We need to find them.
Do something now.

54
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:56,361
We have the axes
and the demon bottles.

55
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,342
You have the incorporate bond.

56
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,135
You didn't give two wet shits

57
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:02,009
when it was Eliot's life
on the line,

58
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,762
and now that it's Julia
you're suddenly leaning in?

59
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,592
Look, we all care
about both of them,

60
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,428
but based on Mayakovsky's
formula

61
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,889
casting an incorporate bond
strong enough to hold a god

62
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,019
would take an insane amount
of power.

63
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,317
Now we need twice as much.

64
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,235
If we go in there
without enough juice

65
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,812
they'll just body hop.

66
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,863
- They'll kill us all.
- Great.

67
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:23,322
Where the hell are we gonna
find that kind of magic?

68
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,786
Hey, Dean.

69
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,660
I would not go in your office
right now, if I were you.

70
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,833
If you shit in my private
bathroom again...

71
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,205
No. Well, see,

72
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:35,379
there's kind of a few
Librarian dudes here to arrest you.

73
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,833
Yeah, they're pretty pissed
about some lecture you gave

74
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,214
while you were pissed.

75
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,921
I've been expecting them.
Come with me.

76
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:49,849
Thank Christ I wore
the right suit today.

77
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,555
The right suit
for being arrested, or...

78
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,309
Wait.
Are you still drunk?

79
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,315
That's entirely
beside the point.

80
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,612
We have a bigger problem.

81
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,778
Kady and Zelda haven't
returned from the Poison Room,

82
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,191
and they're
running out of time.

83
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:05,034
Oh, shit.

84
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,824
Who are they, and what does
that mean, exactly?

85
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,406
- God damn it, focus, Todd.
- Yes.

86
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,894
If I'm going to be arrested,
there still may be a chance

87
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:13,375
that something good
can come from it.

88
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:14,498
Here.

89
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,916
Yes, here.

90
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,850
Take this to the
Library book drop immediately.

91
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:22,989
Tell no one,
do you understand?

92
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:25,630
Sure, keep it confidench.
On it.

93
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:28,341
And try not to "Todd" this up.

94
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,686
I will try not to be myself.

95
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:47,527
Well, so much
for getting Fogg's help.

96
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:58,713
Well, that's the last
of our protection.

97
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,459
On the upside,
tasted minty fresh.

98
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,553
Hmm.

99
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,925
Let's go.

100
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:11,179
Wait.

101
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,519
What the hell?

102
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:25,652
Hello, there.

103
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,405
Apologies, I was trying
not to startle you.

104
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,862
Christopher Plover. Pleasure.

105
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:32,993
The children's book author?

106
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,949
Oh, you're familiar
with my work.

107
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,043
You could say that.

108
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,743
I've read
Martin Chatwin's book.

109
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:41,172
Yes, well, not exactly
the highlight of my <i>o e u vre.</i>

110
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,216
You're the pervert
who turned him into The Beast.

111
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:47,420
I'm the man who survived
in this place for weeks.

112
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,093
And I can show you how

113
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,971
if you help me escape.

114
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,063
Look, it sucks that Fogg's
out of commish,

115
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,640
but who else
can we shake down?

116
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,942
Kady was trying to find
the Library stockpile.

117
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,564
If we knew where that was.

118
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,647
Found magic,
need help!

119
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:06,901
Who sent you?

120
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:09,325
- Found magic, need help!
- Okay, where?

121
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,368
- Vague as shit.
- Oh, sorry.

122
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,740
It's Fen.

123
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,496
Right this way.

124
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,331
High King Fen awaits.

125
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:35,728
Whoa.

126
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,779
Sort of incredible.

127
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,572
Trippy.

128
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,900
Oh, good, you're here.

129
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:54,828
- Fen, what is this?
- And what's with the fish?

130
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,123
Follow me, come on.

131
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:07,549
Holy shit.

132
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,502
This is the reservoir?

133
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:11,303
An ocean of pure magic.

134
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,426
Pretty amazing, right?

135
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,724
I found it.
Well, Josh and me.

136
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,301
And Tick was there too,
I guess.

137
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,808
But, no, a lot of it was me.

138
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:22,974
One small problem...

139
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,309
don't touch it!

140
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,359
That's the tiny
little problem.

141
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,735
It seems to be protected
by some sort of curse.

142
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,696
Look what it did to Josh.

143
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,449
<i>Yo u 're s a yin g Jo s h
is a fu c kin g fis h?</i>

144
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:38,451
Well, of course not.
He's a Fillorian Dying Fish.

145
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,782
A Fillorian Fucking Fish

146
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,868
is a totally
different species.

147
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,999
Wait, "Dying Fish"?

148
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:46,126
I really hope
that's a metaphor.

149
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:49,129
Nope, they only live
a couple days.

150
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:51,131
And you're sure that's Josh?

151
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,462
Oh, I saw it happen.

152
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,717
We were gonna come
straight to you guys,

153
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,925
tell you all about
how we saved the day,

154
00:07:57,018 --> 00:08:00,932
and then he touches the water
and next thing I know, boom,

155
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,388
Josh Fish.

156
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,769
Him and his damn showmanship.

157
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,609
So is it bad
if it turns white?

158
00:08:07,696 --> 00:08:09,779
Great Umber's taint.

159
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,150
What are you doing?

160
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,654
Dying Fish need eye contact,

161
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,109
almost constantly.

162
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:19,114
Usually they get it from their fish moms,
but we'll have to fill in.

163
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,700
Every pet I ever had ended up
in a shoebox or the toilet.

164
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:25,081
- This one's all you.
- It's just until we figure out

165
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,582
how to turn him back
into a person.

166
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,543
Or the rest of his life.

167
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,249
I'm not babysitting Nemo

168
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,756
when we're this close
to saving Eliot.

169
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,593
- I've got bigger fish to fry.
- Shh, Margo!

170
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,471
Don't say "fry" and "fish."

171
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:45,227
It's not working.
He's not getting better.

172
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:48,559
Margo, please. For Josh?

173
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,527
Damn it.

174
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:55,699
So I just look at him?

175
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,701
My Gods.

176
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,326
He perked right up.

177
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,911
He's bonded to you.

178
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,580
He thinks you're his mother.

179
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:14,002
Unfortunately, that's not the
first time that's happened.

180
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,508
Closest thing to the reservoir
in the books

181
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:17,805
is the Secret Sea.

182
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,553
It's an underground ocean.

183
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,053
Chatwins sailed across it

184
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:24,558
with a crew full of
rabbit pirates.

185
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,639
Are those pirates
who steal rabbits,

186
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:27,940
or pirates who are rabbits?

187
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,026
Kind of both.

188
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,147
But it doesn't say anything

189
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,071
about the Secret Sea
being full of magic or cursed,

190
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,991
so maybe there's a clue
that I'm missing.

191
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,694
And if your nerdy bullshit
leads us nowhere?

192
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:40,904
We need a backup plan.

193
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,831
Speaking of bunnies, where are
the ones that Fen sent?

194
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,249
I have an idea.

195
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,998
So do all rabbits talk, or...

196
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,171
Some of them you have to bribe
with cigarettes first.

197
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,714
Look, about my message...

198
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,292
No, I know. I owe you.

199
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,876
But I can't slip you

200
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,007
that kind of power
behind The Order's back.

201
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,839
The monsters have
two of my friends,

202
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,391
and who knows what kind
of chaos they're causing

203
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:03,968
while the Library
does nothing.

204
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,269
Look, Alice...

205
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:09,181
I am no stranger
to messing up a good thing.

206
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:12,063
I'm not gonna do that
with the Library.

207
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:15,237
Well, if we don't do something,
there might not be a Library anymore.

208
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,609
Then why don't you work
with us?

209
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,407
Because your bosses would
arrest all of us on sight.

210
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:20,826
You wanna do some good?

211
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:22,778
This is your best chance.

212
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,454
I hope you find
what you need, Alice.

213
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,709
We're not setting him loose.

214
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:35,841
All we're promising is to take him
with us if we find an exit.

215
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:37,043
Well?

216
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,094
Do we have a deal?

217
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,427
Moss?

218
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,559
My theory is
it counteracts the poison.

219
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,561
Probably why it's
the only other living thing

220
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,142
in this place.

221
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:56,027
Been eating it
since I got here

222
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,696
and I'm as healthy as a horse.

223
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:00,069
How did you get here?

224
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,617
Former prisoner of yours,

225
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,741
Alice Quinn,

226
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,699
seemed to think this was
the place I deserved to be.

227
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,533
I can't say I disagree.

228
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,495
Don't bite the hand
that feeds you, dear.

229
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,166
Shall we?

230
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,517
Huh.

231
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,935
At least give me my dignity.

232
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,764
Sorry. Protocol.

233
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:34,609
Well, this was a new suit.

234
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:36,818
It's a bit loud.

235
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,816
Yes.

236
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,111
It certainly is.

237
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,088
Damn, the history of this
place is depressing as shit.

238
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:05,514
Most world histories are.

239
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,218
Nothing about a way out.

240
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,219
Kady?

241
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,266
Oh, shit.

242
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:16,271
What?

243
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,648
The moss should have
protected you from...

244
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:23,194
- Oh.
- "Oh," what?

245
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,783
The age-suspension spells

246
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,704
Martin used to keep me alive
while he tortured me,

247
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,873
it must still be
keeping me alive.

248
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,075
Perfect.

249
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,127
So I'm gonna die in the most
ironic way possible.

250
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:36,954
Just like Penny.

251
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,757
Well...

252
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,377
Not necessarily.

253
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,421
If we get back in time...

254
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,807
Wait,

255
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,352
all this time

256
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,601
the Library had a cure?

257
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:56,808
- Kady...
- No, you...

258
00:12:56,901 --> 00:13:00,440
you chose not to save Penny?

259
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,362
- If it were up to me...
- It was.

260
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,235
It's called "The Poison Room."

261
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,408
The name is a warning
Penny chose to ignore.

262
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:09,111
No, no, no, you don't get
to hide behind the Library.

263
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,948
You think if you're a cog
in a fascist machine

264
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,034
that you're not responsible
for the people that it kills?

265
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,539
I'll admit, the Library veered

266
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,087
in an authoritarian direction.

267
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,881
Because of Everett. Once we
remove him from power...

268
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,675
No, no,
it is not just Everett.

269
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,923
It's the whole goddamn Order.

270
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:28,472
It all needs
to be burned down.

271
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,891
Not if it can be reformed.

272
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,970
Look, as someone
who lived through

273
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,725
two world wars,
I can tell you,

274
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,023
authoritarian regimes,
they fail eventually.

275
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:39,109
See?

276
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:40,379
Look, even the pedophile
agrees with me.

277
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:42,269
Oh, hardly.

278
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:45,230
Problem is,

279
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,863
no one will ever
let you change.

280
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,660
People always see you
for what you've done,

281
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,238
never for who you are.

282
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,073
So at the end of the day,

283
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,352
no matter what
you try to become,

284
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,958
some judgmental blonde bitch

285
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,128
always shoves you down
a poison well.

286
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:00,954
Yeah?

287
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,792
Well, then
I'm Team Blonde Bitch.

288
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,598
- Where's Fen?
- I sent her out for fish flakes

289
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,144
three hours ago.

290
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,018
Wait, you sent her out
alone in Manhattan?

291
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:22,101
Well, I kind of implied it was
her fault Josh was a fish

292
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,528
and blah, blah, blah,
I'd blame her forever,

293
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,321
so she's cooling off
at Benihana.

294
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:30,530
She never could resist
a sharp knife.

295
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,617
Meanwhile, I'm trying
to read up on a damn cure

296
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,915
while maintaining constant eye
contact with an anchovy.

297
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,122
And they say girls
are the ones who get needy

298
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,498
once you fuck them.

299
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,373
Wait, were you and Josh...

300
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:44,502
Wait, you know about

301
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,255
the werewolf stuff, right?

302
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,052
Who gives a shit?

303
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,004
- Nothing matters.
- Okay.

304
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:53,557
Look, it's not a big deal,
all right?

305
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,727
Sometimes we bang.
He makes me laugh.

306
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:58,304
And I like having him around

307
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,980
'cause of the
aforementioned banging,

308
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:03,150
and he just you know,
he kind of gets me. So what?

309
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:05,649
It's not like I'm in love
with Josh Hoberman.

310
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,980
It kinda sounds
like you are, though.

311
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:12,072
Have you met me?
I don't do feelings.

312
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,370
I'm the bitch
with the ice axes.

313
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,368
You can still care
about a guy,

314
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:20,326
werewolf, fish.

315
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,878
And it doesn't make you
any less you.

316
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:25,581
I mean, you can still be
a bitch if you want to.

317
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:28,425
Hmm. Shit.

318
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,922
Maybe I do love
this goddamn guppy.

319
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:37,510
Uh, I think this is
the Hedge doctor

320
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:39,219
that Kady called to fix Pete.

321
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,645
Says he's a veterinarian.

322
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,597
Maybe he can help
with the fish-Josh.

323
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,024
Josh-fish.

324
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,443
Way to be useful, Coldwater.

325
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,156
Is this Gordy?

326
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:53,950
Yeah, I've got fish problems.

327
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,786
- Josh and Margo.
- Yeah.

328
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,502
Okay, here's my thing,

329
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:12,596
um...

330
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,382
I didn't think that I could
ever trust you again.

331
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:21,554
And now...

332
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:23,684
"And now"?

333
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:27,352
I find myself wanting to.

334
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:43,625
When we first met,

335
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,454
I was clinging onto some

336
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:51,463
naive, idealistic notions
of what the world should be.

337
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:55,136
How people should be.

338
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,345
And I think that
I have realized

339
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,730
if I just throw away
all that childish bullshit,

340
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:08,062
I can forgive people.

341
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:14,023
For not living up
to my stupid expectations.

342
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,025
Like yourself?

343
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,701
What if we try again?

344
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:30,081
I want you in my life, Alice.

345
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,254
I want that, too.

346
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:46,263
Cyrus.

347
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:50,438
There was an intrusion
in the Poison Room.

348
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:52,645
It's Zelda.

349
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,151
With a hedge witch.

350
00:17:56,701 --> 00:18:00,320
- Did you follow protocol?
- Yes, they're locked in.

351
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,993
But do we really just
leave her to die in there?

352
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,343
How long do you think we have?

353
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,422
If we got out now? A few days.

354
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:24,259
In here? A few hours.

355
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,313
The after-effects of the bugs slowed the...

356
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,812
Zelda? Shit.

357
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:42,448
Sorry to knock you out
like that.

358
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,121
It's the only way
we could talk.

359
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,715
You could have freed me.

360
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,463
You brought a hedge witch

361
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,089
into our most
protected archive.

362
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,218
I read your book.
You're hoarding magic.

363
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:05,096
Trying to become a god. Why?

364
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:06,472
I put in centuries of work

365
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:08,519
before you ever knew
the Library existed.

366
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:11,690
- Oh, so I wouldn't understand.
- No, you should understand.

367
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,813
How...

368
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:15,769
futile it all is.

369
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,571
We work so hard to protect
the flame of knowledge,

370
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:21,742
but there will always be
things we can't understand.

371
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:23,410
Knowledge of the Gods.

372
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:26,989
By becoming one of them,
I can rip their secrets away from them

373
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,824
and bring them back
to the Library.

374
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:30,250
At what cost?

375
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:33,170
An unkillable god
is on the loose as we speak.

376
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,497
In the body of Eliot Waugh.

377
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:37,833
You intend to take his power.

378
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,590
He has the power
to destroy everything,

379
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,546
and all we have are books.

380
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,256
If we want to face
that kind of threat,

381
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,467
we need power, too.

382
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,112
Isn't that what Bacchus and
the others were trying to do?

383
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,693
They got drunk
on their own power.

384
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,198
Some of them literally.

385
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,905
What makes you think you won't
fall prey to the same hubris?

386
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,036
Well, I thought I had you.

387
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:19,291
Excuse me,
but isn't this book banned?

388
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:21,877
Like, really, really banned?

389
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,761
Fuck me. Uh,

390
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,510
we need to get that
to the Poison Room.

391
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,263
Immediately. Now, now, now.

392
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:03,176
You wanted me.

393
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,304
To do what, exactly?

394
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,928
To take over the Library
once I'm gone.

395
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,352
To see to the human concerns,

396
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,687
and to fix my mistakes

397
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:18,892
with the benefit of all the knowledge
and the power I would bring.

398
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:21,312
I wish you'd told me
the truth sooner.

399
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:22,525
So do I.

400
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,407
So, do what you must.

401
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:31,200
- Follow protocol.
- There is a way you can still help me.

402
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,583
I redirected the power I need
into a reservoir,

403
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,706
but it triggered
a protective spell.

404
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,163
A puzzle I can't solve.

405
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,084
But I've discovered
someone who can.

406
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:42,716
Quentin Coldwater.

407
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,044
Get Quentin to open
the reservoir,

408
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,130
and the Library can
still be yours to lead if...

409
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,428
Did you slap me?

410
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,143
We need to move, fast.

411
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:58,348
No. I didn't risk my life
to save a child molester.

412
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:00,980
- He can stay.
- What? No.

413
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,403
We had a deal! Tell him!

414
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,907
Well, your moss
didn't do shit for us, so...

415
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,905
But I can help you
get to the reservoir.

416
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:16,120
It was a secret of Martin's,
and I know all his secrets.

417
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,161
I could share them with you.

418
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:29,091
Incursion protocol.
They're patrolling.

419
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:30,557
Come on.

420
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:37,437
Get to the Earth fountain,

421
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,847
I'll hold them off. Go!

422
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,200
Damn it.

423
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,175
Quite a trip you sent me on.

424
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,244
You ruined my suit.

425
00:22:58,335 --> 00:22:59,496
But the good news is,

426
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:02,746
you're just about my size.

427
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,591
Keep barking,
you schnauzer fuck.

428
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:12,968
It won't bring back
your balls.

429
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:14,938
God, I hate animals.

430
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:18,021
So...

431
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,557
- Goldfish troubles?
- Not exactly.

432
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:27,904
I see. Not a goldfish.
Some kind of hybrid?

433
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,322
Oh, my God.

434
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:31,991
I am sorry to be
the bearer of bad news,

435
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,410
but your fish is a werewolf.

436
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,202
Wait. So are you.

437
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,492
Did...

438
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,077
Did you fuck this fish?

439
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,046
Look, he's a human
who's been cursed,

440
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,748
and I need to know
how to undo it.

441
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,425
Well, it's definitely
not a hedge spell.

442
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,906
And without knowing
how it was cast,

443
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,592
not much I can do about it.

444
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,367
So, should I just go ahead
and flush it, or...

445
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,348
Again, he's a person.

446
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,018
I'm gonna need you to try
a little harder, all right?

447
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,437
Now, if I look away
for literally 10 seconds,

448
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:04,061
he starts to die, and at some
point, I'm gonna need to sleep

449
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,768
or drop a deuce,
and I don't allow spectators.

450
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:12,407
Yeah, there is some kind
of bond happening there.

451
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:16,578
Whoa. Your eye is crazy.

452
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,658
Is that a wolf thing, or...

453
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,415
Fairy thing.

454
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:22,208
Can we focus
on fish boy, please?

455
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,001
It's not even attached
to your head.

456
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,954
You ever pop it out?

457
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:28,711
Why the shit would I pop out
my own eyeball, Gordy?

458
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:33,174
So you can point it
at your gilled lover

459
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:37,348
while you attend
to lady business.

460
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,691
I don't know, man. It feels
pretty stuck in there.

461
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,486
Ahh!

462
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:55,109
Holy shit, it's working.

463
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,693
I can still see out of it.

464
00:24:56,787 --> 00:24:59,780
You ever touch me again,
I'll pop out your balls.

465
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,042
Uh...

466
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,498
See? Problem solved.

467
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:14,885
I don't know. This seems
kind of problematic.

468
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:17,089
Oh, I got just the thing.

469
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,137
Really?

470
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:28,437
Why does a veterinarian have
a pirate-themed eye patch?

471
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:32,112
Maybe it's best we don't ask
a lot of follow-up questions.

472
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:36,449
Jesus, what happened to you?

473
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,535
Hey.

474
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:40,654
- Just...
- Hello, Alice.

475
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:42,809
- Thought he was dead.
- Why'd you bring him here?

476
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:45,621
Because I just might be
the only person alive

477
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:47,748
who knows how to access
the reservoir

478
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:48,838
and save your friends.

479
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:54,341
- Mmm.
- Okay, so, the reservoir.

480
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:56,670
Yes, well,
that's what Martin called it.

481
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:00,215
I thought it lacked
a certain poetry.

482
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:03,431
So I renamed it
the Secret Sea.

483
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,519
Right,
the fourth <i>Fillo ry</i> book.

484
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:08,314
Mmm. Oh, I see
you have a copy here.

485
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:10,943
Ah.

486
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:12,028
Oh.

487
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,238
- First edition That must be valuable.
- Yes.

488
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:19,493
Well, even more so now.

489
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,541
The Watcher Woman
in the books,

490
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:29,540
she was trying to steal all
of magic for herself, right?

491
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,121
And then Martin stops her.

492
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:34,083
Most of that book
is pure tosh.

493
00:26:34,176 --> 00:26:37,169
I had to invent that plot
from whole cloth

494
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,262
since, well,

495
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:41,010
I couldn't exactly
publish the stories

496
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,057
as the children told them
to me, could I?

497
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,759
I mean, the Flying Forest,

498
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:47,641
where the Chatwins discovered
recreational drug use?

499
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,224
Poor little Jane
hearing all about the birds

500
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,399
and the bees from a...

501
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:56,275
Did you know that centaurs
view necrophilia

502
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,402
as a way of honoring the dead?

503
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,282
Don't think I'd get
a Carnegie Medal

504
00:27:00,369 --> 00:27:02,235
for explaining that
to children.

505
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:06,702
I mean, then there's all the
exaggerations and the lies.

506
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:10,581
I mean, Martin slaying
a dozen mercenaries,

507
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:15,090
and Jane riding on top of a
horse, what, 100 feet tall?

508
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:17,254
- I mean, what did she call it?
- Cozy Horse.

509
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:20,928
"Cozy Horse."
Utter nonsense thrown in there

510
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:23,552
just to see how much
they'd get me to believe,

511
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,634
and then Jane insisted
I keep it.

512
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:29,061
In real life,
the ending was much darker.

513
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:31,936
Oh, Martin did stop the Watcher Woman,
that's true.

514
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,062
The Secret Sea

515
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,566
was built by
the thirteenth king of Fillory

516
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,738
to consolidate power
for himself.

517
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:42,033
Martin wanted to make sure
that no one ever tried

518
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:46,113
to do the same thing again
so he drained the Secret Sea

519
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:49,165
using the last few drops
to set a trap

520
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:52,164
for anyone who might,
one day, try to refill it.

521
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:53,711
A curse.

522
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:56,539
Right, so now, one of
our friends is a fish.

523
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:59,546
Well,
he was 13 at the time.

524
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:03,300
You have to forgive his rather
adolescent sense of humor.

525
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,426
You know how to fix it?

526
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:05,558
Mmm.

527
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:08,134
There's a garden
just outside the reservoir.

528
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,971
The Drowned Garden,
Martin called it.

529
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:12,772
Never did know why.

530
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:15,692
It reacts to your emotions.

531
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,024
You feel happy,
a flower blooms.

532
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,356
You feel sad, another one.

533
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,658
So, one of the plants
is the antidote?

534
00:28:23,994 --> 00:28:25,155
Indeed.

535
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,239
To make it bloom,

536
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:32,076
you have to
truly love Fillory.

537
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,923
Maybe when I was 12, but...

538
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:44,550
I don't know, Fillory's taken
away a lot of the shit I love.

539
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,848
Martin had
the same problem.

540
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,183
He returned as an adult

541
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:52,353
and could not make
the flower bloom.

542
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,849
His innocent love for Fillory

543
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:58,686
had soured.

544
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:00,645
I think
we can all say why.

545
00:29:01,323 --> 00:29:02,905
Quentin.

546
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:06,280
It has to be you.

547
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,491
I'm familiar with your books.

548
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:13,325
Even considering
your recent experiences,

549
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,660
Quentin has
the best chance of...

550
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:19,039
making the garden grow.

551
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,211
We don't have much time.

552
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,092
There's a contractor
the Library uses

553
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,263
who might be willing to...

554
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,716
Text me if you find somebody.

555
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,985
So it's true?
The Library has a cure?

556
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:44,988
I know, it's bullshit.

557
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:47,488
Go with her
before it's too late.

558
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,945
If this is some noble shit

559
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,577
about you not owing
the Library anything...

560
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:58,421
Oh.

561
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,087
You don't want to be cured.

562
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:04,129
'Cause for all the terrible
shit we've been through,

563
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,630
at least the upside is

564
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,481
that you know that
there's a life after death

565
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,847
and you get to spend forever
with the other Penny.

566
00:30:10,434 --> 00:30:12,050
And what part of that
sounds bad?

567
00:30:12,144 --> 00:30:14,306
The part where you're dead.

568
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:17,810
I may not know you
the way he did,

569
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:20,266
but I know that that
would be a hell of a waste.

570
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:23,568
Yeah.

571
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,731
Well, most things are.

572
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,534
A lot's changed
since I've been gone.

573
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:35,956
Yes.

574
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:38,994
The humans made
lots of good stuff.

575
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:42,539
They spend their small lives
building things

576
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:45,466
that we could smash
in a heartbeat.

577
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:46,671
Sounds fun.

578
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:49,095
Perhaps you can tell me...

579
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:50,797
Do I have a name?

580
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:54,263
Why would you need one?

581
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:58,103
Starbucks, mostly.

582
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,431
This whole time I felt
so sorry for you.

583
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,266
Lost and alone.

584
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:04,523
But you weren't alone.
You were with the humans.

585
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,401
You talk like them,
you think like them.

586
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,116
I ate a few of them.

587
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,946
Yes, but you care about them.

588
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:23,622
You think I'm disappointed.

589
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,047
I'm not.

590
00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:31,220
Are you scared of me,
little brother?

591
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,298
Would I have worked so hard
to bring you back

592
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,475
if I was scared of you?

593
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,011
All I thought about was you.

594
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:42,224
After I remembered
you existed, anyway.

595
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:45,143
And all I thought about
was revenge.

596
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:48,146
And I got it
for you already.

597
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,860
I killed Bacchus.

598
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:52,442
Iris.

599
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,577
All of them.

600
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:56,991
Everyone
who hurt you.

601
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,325
The question is
who put us here?

602
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:05,497
Our parents.

603
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:07,999
They made us,
called us mistakes.

604
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:09,334
Abandoned us.

605
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:12,421
So, what do we do?

606
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,881
I like murder
as much as anyone,

607
00:32:14,975 --> 00:32:17,217
but I did all of this

608
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,347
just to be with you.

609
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,064
Can't we enjoy it
just for a little while?

610
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,608
That's not what
we were made for.

611
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:31,030
It's not that I am terrified
of the Old Gods in any way.

612
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:33,403
It's just,
how do you kill

613
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:36,201
an intangible
thought creature?

614
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:38,245
Where do you even stab?

615
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:42,037
They're more vulnerable
than you think.

616
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,210
If we can get to their realm.

617
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:46,375
Which we cannot.

618
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:49,290
We have a key.
A scroll.

619
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,381
Found it a very long time ago
on this world.

620
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:53,678
The Order took it from us.

621
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,925
They didn't even know
what they had.

622
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:57,302
Now,

623
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,305
where would a bunch
of Librarians

624
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:04,230
keep a very,
very important scroll?

625
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,412
Oh.

626
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:19,704
Here.

627
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,239
This has to be it.

628
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:23,954
It's exactly
as Martin described it.

629
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,461
Think happy thoughts

630
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,379
about Fillory.

631
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:31,082
Pure.

632
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,917
Innocent.

633
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:35,636
Maybe try talking to it.

634
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,258
Okay, can you just...

635
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,061
Well...

636
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,891
Um, Fillory is...

637
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:50,442
obviously great.

638
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:53,567
You know,
talking bears, right?

639
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:55,523
Who could hate that?

640
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,780
And opium in the air.

641
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:01,404
That was...

642
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,034
smart.

643
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,866
And...

644
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,376
socialized centaur medicine.

645
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:09,670
Are we screwed

646
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:12,373
- because Quentin can't get it up for Fillory?
- Just...

647
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,507
Look, why don't you try...

648
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:14,674
Okay, no, stop.

649
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,322
I can't...
Look, you're the one that ruined this.

650
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:17,490
I can't do it with you
over my shoulder,

651
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:19,631
so just, please, just go.

652
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,931
God damn it.

653
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,445
Okay, um...

654
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:37,990
When I was a kid,
I loved the Fizzy River

655
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,988
that they found in book two.

656
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,535
And I loved...

657
00:34:42,247 --> 00:34:44,204
I loved
the Upside-Down Desert.

658
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:46,203
You know, the...

659
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:48,705
I can't really picture it,
but, you know, it sounds...

660
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,245
It sounds cool.

661
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,751
I don't know,
I can't, I'm sorry.

662
00:34:56,845 --> 00:35:00,179
- I just... I can't...
- Hey. Hey.

663
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:03,675
I used to love Fillory
when I was a kid

664
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,885
because I didn't know
what it was.

665
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,142
Plover left out
all of the terrible shit,

666
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:11,224
and most of the good stuff
he just made up.

667
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:14,561
Even the fucking Cozy Horse
is a lie.

668
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,027
Remember what you told me

669
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,026
about letting go
of who you used to be?

670
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,107
I know, I'm trying.

671
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,362
Don't.

672
00:35:22,996 --> 00:35:24,487
I don't want you to.

673
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:28,200
Believing in something,
really believing,

674
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:30,205
is almost impossible.

675
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,630
But the Quentin I first met...

676
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:37,299
he believed in magic.

677
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:39,919
And in Fillory.

678
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:42,213
He changed.

679
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,382
He grew up.

680
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,553
Being an adult doesn't mean
that you have to throw away

681
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:50,104
what you used to love.

682
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:52,857
Then what does it mean?

683
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,269
Seeing the world
through new eyes.

684
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,868
And for
what it's worth,

685
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,821
the Cozy Horse is real.

686
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,326
I saw her when I was a Niffin.

687
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,784
So big you could
build a house on it.

688
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:13,919
So...

689
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,713
Let's go.

690
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,521
Okay, it's just you and me.

691
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,192
You know the worst part

692
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,069
of getting exactly
what you want?

693
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:48,575
When it's not good enough.

694
00:36:51,418 --> 00:36:53,159
Then what do you do?

695
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,460
If this can't make me happy,
then what would?

696
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:06,339
Fillory was supposed
to mean something.

697
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:11,143
I was supposed
to mean something here.

698
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:15,473
But it's all... It's just...
It's random.

699
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:18,480
It's so random that the only
way to save my friends

700
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,857
is to yell at a fucking plant!

701
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:28,236
Honestly, fuck Fillory
for being so disappointing.

702
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,809
You know what,
maybe I was better off

703
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:33,870
just believing
that it was fiction.

704
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:37,954
The idea of Fillory

705
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:40,084
is what saved my life!

706
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:46,254
This promise...

707
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,423
that...

708
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,930
people like me...

709
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:58,440
People like me...

710
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,735
Can somehow...

711
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:06,232
Find an escape.

712
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,329
There has gotta be
some power in that.

713
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:19,875
Shouldn't loving the idea
of Fillory be enough?

714
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,440
Guys.

715
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:52,741
Guys, something's happening!

716
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:18,971
Here's the door.

717
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:03,607
The key to the realm
of the Old Gods.

718
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:35,176
How the hell
does this thing work?

719
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:39,927
Give this to Margo.

720
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:42,020
If Plover's right,
it should cure Josh.

721
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:44,898
Monsters in Library!

722
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:51,693
- Sheila must have sent it.
- Monsters in Library!

723
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,463
All right, we have to go
before they leave.

724
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,025
Okay, I'll grab Margo
and the axes.

725
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,530
Hey, you sure
this is gonna work?

726
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:57,737
Well, either it will,

727
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,571
or when you come back
we'll both be fish.

728
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,703
Well, that'd be
an improvement.

729
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,710
- Okay.
- Okay.

730
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,927
Do you feel anything?

731
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,841
Super stressed out?

732
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:18,049
Okay.

733
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:23,057
Ugh.

734
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:26,690
Yeah,
I'm totally feeling that.

735
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:27,812
Okay.

736
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:33,281
Grab your axes.

737
00:41:33,366 --> 00:41:34,902
Monsters in the Library.

738
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:37,284
Are you baking for a fish?

739
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,986
He has a refined palate.

740
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,960
Yeah, here, this should fix
the whole fish deal.

741
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:42,740
And, yes, I noticed

742
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:44,895
that your eyeball isn't in your head,
but honestly, we do not have time

743
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,000
for me to hear that story.

744
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:47,953
- How long does the leaf take?
- I don't know.

745
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:50,039
But you know it works?

746
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,592
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

747
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,545
but I can't go
until he's cured.

748
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:58,885
If I leave, Josh will die.

749
00:41:58,975 --> 00:42:00,682
- It's okay.
- Penny.

750
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:02,726
I'll bring Eliot back.

751
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:03,848
I promise.

752
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,188
Damn cheap bastards.

753
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,606
No, no, please!

754
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,814
No!

755
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,610
Shit.

756
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:28,168
What did you do
to get locked in this cage?

757
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,087
Well, I...

758
00:42:31,716 --> 00:42:34,584
I went against
every instinct I had.

759
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,882
I tried to make
a goddamn difference.

760
00:42:38,139 --> 00:42:40,802
Which, for the record,
you should never, ever do.

761
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,098
Julia...

762
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:49,106
if you're in there,

763
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,604
then I'm sorry...

764
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:54,816
for everything
that happened to you...

765
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:57,110
Because of me.

766
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,282
Hey, Monster...

767
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:01,072
Lady.

768
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,341
Adorable.
