So...

551
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:15,641
goldfish troubles?

552
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:17,245
Not exactly.

553
00:23:19,057 --> 00:23:20,440
I see.

554
00:23:20,589 --> 00:23:21,922
Not a goldfish.

555
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:23,198
Some kind of hybrid?

556
00:23:23,393 --> 00:23:24,633
Oh, my God.

557
00:23:25,206 --> 00:23:27,282
I am sorry to be
the bearer of bad news,

558
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:30,440
but your fish is a werewolf.

559
00:23:31,151 --> 00:23:32,671
Wait.

560
00:23:32,758 --> 00:23:34,284
So are you.

561
00:23:34,628 --> 00:23:37,815
Did... did you fuck this fish?

562
00:23:38,034 --> 00:23:40,407
Look, he's a human
who's been cursed,

563
00:23:40,495 --> 00:23:42,110
and I need to know
how to undo it.

564
00:23:42,198 --> 00:23:44,661
Well, it's definitely not
a hedge spell.

565
00:23:44,768 --> 00:23:46,064
And without knowing
how it was cast,

566
00:23:46,151 --> 00:23:47,612
not much I can do about it.

567
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,680
So, should I just go ahead
and flush it, or...

568
00:23:49,768 --> 00:23:51,671
Again, he's a person.

569
00:23:51,792 --> 00:23:54,250
I'm gonna need you to try
a little harder, all right?

570
00:23:54,338 --> 00:23:56,596
Now, if I look away
for literally ten seconds

571
00:23:56,684 --> 00:23:57,634
he starts to die,

572
00:23:57,722 --> 00:23:59,549
and at some point
I'm gonna need to sleep

573
00:23:59,637 --> 00:24:02,456
or drop a deuce,
and I don't allow spectators.

574
00:24:03,888 --> 00:24:06,075
Yeah, there is some kind

575
00:24:06,163 --> 00:24:07,906
of bond happening there.

576
00:24:08,231 --> 00:24:09,379
Whoa.

577
00:24:09,467 --> 00:24:12,044
Your eye is crazy.

578
00:24:12,316 --> 00:24:14,159
Is that a wolf thing, or...

579
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:15,645
Fairy thing.

580
00:24:15,733 --> 00:24:17,450
Can we focus
on fish boy, please?

581
00:24:17,538 --> 00:24:19,421
It's not even attached
to your head.

582
00:24:19,634 --> 00:24:21,329
You ever pop it out?

583
00:24:21,417 --> 00:24:24,280
Why the shit would I pop out
my own eyeball, Gordy?

584
00:24:24,535 --> 00:24:27,040
So you can point it

585
00:24:27,213 --> 00:24:28,226
at your gilled lover

586
00:24:28,314 --> 00:24:30,696
while you attend to...

587
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:33,243
lady business.

588
00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:39,868
I don't know, man.

589
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,946
It feels pretty stuck in there.

590
00:24:42,695 --> 00:24:44,189
Ah!

591
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:50,366
Holy shit, it's working.

592
00:24:50,454 --> 00:24:52,100
I can still see out of it.

593
00:24:52,188 --> 00:24:55,452
You ever touch me again,
I'll pop out your balls.

594
00:24:57,192 --> 00:24:58,928
Uh...

595
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:04,704
[laughs]
See?

596
00:25:04,792 --> 00:25:06,155
Problem solved.

597
00:25:06,284 --> 00:25:07,459
I don't know.

598
00:25:07,551 --> 00:25:10,123
This seems
kind of problematic.

599
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:13,376
Oh, I got just the thing.

600
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,663
Really?

601
00:25:20,089 --> 00:25:24,112
Why does a veterinarian have
a pirate-themed eye patch?

602
00:25:24,238 --> 00:25:27,827
Maybe it's best we don't ask
a lot of follow-up questions.

603
00:25:29,906 --> 00:25:31,741
Jesus, what happened to you?

00:25:31,829 --> 00:25:33,069

- Thought he was dead.
- Why'd you bring him here?

608
00:25:38,372 --> 00:25:41,198
Because I just might be
the only person alive

609
00:25:41,286 --> 00:25:42,897
who knows how to access
the reservoir

610
00:25:42,985 --> 00:25:44,811

Okay, so the... the reservoir.

614
00:25:49,934 --> 00:25:52,108
Yes, well,
that's what Martin called it.

615
00:25:52,296 --> 00:25:53,569
I thought it lacked

616
00:25:53,657 --> 00:25:55,811
a certain poetry.

617
00:25:55,995 --> 00:25:58,818
So I renamed it
the Secret Sea.

618
00:25:59,061 --> 00:26:01,639
Right, the fourth...
The fourth "Fillory" book.

619

have a copy here.

- That must be valuable.
- Yes.

00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:12,089
Well...

624
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,103
even more so now.

The Watcherwoman
in the books,

627
00:26:20,393 --> 00:26:22,854
she was...

628
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,954
trying to steal all of magic
for herself, right?

629
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,361
And then...
And then Martin stops her.

630
00:26:26,448 --> 00:26:29,430
Most of that book
is pure tosh.

631
00:26:29,518 --> 00:26:32,407
I had to invent that plot
from the whole class.

632
00:26:32,495 --> 00:26:36,305
It's... well, I couldn't exactly
publish the stories

633
00:26:36,393 --> 00:26:38,430
as the children
told them to me, could I?

634
00:26:38,518 --> 00:26:39,969
I mean, the "Flying Forest,"

635
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:43,815
where the Chatwins discovered
recreational drug use?

636
00:26:44,041 --> 00:26:48,188
Poor little Jane hearing about
the birds and the bees from a...

637
00:26:48,276 --> 00:26:51,578
Did you know that centaurs
view necrophilia

638
00:26:51,666 --> 00:26:53,635
as a way of honoring the dead?

639
00:26:53,723 --> 00:26:55,717
Don't think I'd get
a Carnegie Medal

640
00:26:55,805 --> 00:26:57,901
for explaining that
to children.

641
00:26:58,008 --> 00:26:59,383
I mean, then there's all the...

642
00:26:59,471 --> 00:27:01,824
All the exaggerations
and the lies.

643
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:06,080
I mean, Martin slaying
a dozen mercenaries,

644
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,227
and Jane riding
on top of a horse,

645
00:27:08,315 --> 00:27:10,336
what, 100 feet tall?

646
00:27:10,424 --> 00:27:11,768
I mean, what did she call it?

647
00:27:11,951 --> 00:27:14,014
- Cozy Horse.
- "Cozy Horse."

Utter nonsense
thrown in there

649
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,791
just to see how much
they'd get me to believe,

650
00:27:18,951 --> 00:27:21,008
and then Jane insisted
I keep it.

651
00:27:21,096 --> 00:27:24,360
In real life, the ending was...
Was much darker.

652
00:27:24,448 --> 00:27:27,321
Oh, Martin did stop
the Watcherwoman, that's true.

653
00:27:27,409 --> 00:27:29,874
The Secret Sea was built

654
00:27:29,961 --> 00:27:31,864
by the 13th king of Fillory

655
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:34,250
to consolidate power
for himself.

656
00:27:34,338 --> 00:27:37,804
Martin wanted to make sure
that no one ever tried

657
00:27:37,891 --> 00:27:41,344
to do the same thing again
so he drained the Secret Sea,

658
00:27:41,432 --> 00:27:44,448
using the last few drops
to set a trap

659
00:27:44,541 --> 00:27:47,237
for anyone who might
one day try to refill it.

660
00:27:47,338 --> 00:27:49,305
A... a curse.

661
00:27:49,393 --> 00:27:51,814
Right, so now one
of our friends is a fish.

662
00:27:51,916 --> 00:27:54,666
[laughs]
Well, he was 13 at the time.

663
00:27:54,785 --> 00:27:56,078
You have to forgive

664
00:27:56,166 --> 00:27:58,721
his rather adolescent
sense of humor.

665
00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:00,732
- You know how to fix it?
- Mm-hmm.

666
00:28:00,897 --> 00:28:03,448
There's a garden
just outside the reservoir.

667
00:28:03,536 --> 00:28:06,469
The Drowned Garden,
Martin called it.

668
00:28:06,557 --> 00:28:08,588
Never did know why.

669
00:28:08,936 --> 00:28:11,176
It reacts to your emotions.

670
00:28:11,871 --> 00:28:14,207
If you're happy,
a flower blooms.

671
00:28:14,295 --> 00:28:16,498
If you're sad, another one.

672
00:28:16,586 --> 00:28:19,129
So one of the plants
is the antidote?

673
00:28:19,217 --> 00:28:20,693
Indeed.

674
00:28:22,081 --> 00:28:23,842
To make it bloom...

675
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:27,795
you have to truly love Fillory.

676
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,311
Maybe when I was 12, but...

677
00:28:36,428 --> 00:28:38,783
I don't know,
Fillory's taken away

678
00:28:38,871 --> 00:28:40,043
a lot of the shit I love.

679
00:28:40,131 --> 00:28:42,459
Martin had the same problem.

680
00:28:42,941 --> 00:28:45,178
He returned as an adult and...

681
00:28:45,342 --> 00:28:47,982
could not make
the flower bloom.

682
00:28:48,584 --> 00:28:51,303
His innocent love for Fillory

683
00:28:51,391 --> 00:28:54,004
had... had soured.

684
00:28:54,091 --> 00:28:56,164
Think we can all say why.

685
00:28:56,617 --> 00:28:57,992

686
00:28:59,941 --> 00:29:01,914
It has to be you.

687
00:29:03,124 --> 00:29:05,125
I'm familiar with your books.

688
00:29:05,585 --> 00:29:08,625
Even considering
your recent experiences,

689
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:11,367
Quentin has
the best chance of...

00:29:12,132 --> 00:29:14,039

the Library uses

- Text me if you find somebody.

I know, it's bullshit.

Go with her
before it's too late.

is that you know that
there's a life after death
