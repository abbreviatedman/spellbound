1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,674
Previously, on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:12,099
A huge reservoir of magic
hidden underneath the castle?

3
00:00:12,409 --> 00:00:15,229
Where does it lead?
To Roderick's secret chamber?

4
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:16,759
The Binder had a theory.

5
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:20,199
When a being of great power
such as a God is killed,

6
00:00:20,209 --> 00:00:21,509
their energy is lost.

7
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:23,859
But he believed it could be preserved,

8
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:26,559
effectively turning
the magician into a God.

9
00:00:26,619 --> 00:00:28,739
Oh, thank Christ.
I didn't think I'd get through.

10
00:00:28,749 --> 00:00:30,529
Listen, I don't have a lot of time.

11
00:00:30,549 --> 00:00:31,749
We need your help.

12
00:00:31,779 --> 00:00:33,299
Surviving first year students,

13
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:36,039
I am here to teach you what not to do.

14
00:00:36,049 --> 00:00:38,569
The Library, they don't
want you to know it.

15
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:39,739
Before we go in,

16
00:00:39,749 --> 00:00:41,829
there's a small matter of protection.

17
00:00:41,839 --> 00:00:43,309
- What is it?
- Insects.

18
00:00:43,319 --> 00:00:46,049
The bugs only last an hour,
so we need to be quick.

19
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:47,789
Everett's been lying to all of us.

20
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:49,579
To do what?

21
00:00:49,589 --> 00:00:50,839
To become a God.

22
00:00:50,849 --> 00:00:53,099
- It's locked.
- Don't you have the key?

23
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:54,449
Someone locked us in.

24
00:00:54,459 --> 00:00:56,019
- Who's dying?
- My sister.

25
00:00:56,029 --> 00:00:58,929
I found her a body,
but I need to find one

26
00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:01,889
that is more durable.

27
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:03,189
Like yours.

28
00:01:15,529 --> 00:01:18,389
No running away, little not-God.

29
00:01:18,399 --> 00:01:21,479
I'd hate to damage my sister's new body.

30
00:01:22,845 --> 00:01:25,535
♪ Good news, sister ♪

31
00:01:25,545 --> 00:01:27,235
I have found you

32
00:01:27,245 --> 00:01:30,235
a much more durable body.

33
00:01:30,245 --> 00:01:31,975
But I am going to have

34
00:01:31,985 --> 00:01:34,935
to momentarily kill you again.

35
00:01:34,945 --> 00:01:36,585
Shh, shh.

36
00:01:38,905 --> 00:01:41,725
I beseech you, Our Lady Underground...

37
00:01:46,825 --> 00:01:48,555
You know what, fuck this.

38
00:01:48,565 --> 00:01:49,945
You said you chose me,

39
00:01:49,955 --> 00:01:52,125
so now's your chance to prove it.

40
00:01:52,135 --> 00:01:54,215
Julia.

41
00:01:59,665 --> 00:02:01,745
Kinda cutting it close, don't you think?

42
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:03,745
I didn't come here to fix it.

43
00:02:03,755 --> 00:02:04,925
I can't.

44
00:02:04,935 --> 00:02:06,674
You still have a chance.

45
00:02:06,675 --> 00:02:08,485
A choice of what you want to be.

46
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:12,105
You're saying this whole time
me being a human and a God,

47
00:02:12,115 --> 00:02:14,935
this was all just a test?

48
00:02:14,945 --> 00:02:17,805
Well, both options are shit.

49
00:02:17,815 --> 00:02:21,195
I mean, you're... you're saying
one is pass and one is fail?

50
00:02:21,205 --> 00:02:24,065
You will not fail as long
as the decision is yours.

51
00:02:24,075 --> 00:02:27,155
Now go! I can only hold him for so long!

52
00:02:27,165 --> 00:02:28,505
Oh, shit.

53
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:30,855
Run!

55
00:02:56,065 --> 00:02:58,805
Jesus Christ.
So the monster took Julia.

56
00:02:58,815 --> 00:03:01,075
We need to find them. Do something now.

57
00:03:01,085 --> 00:03:02,585
We have the axes and the demon bottles,

58
00:03:02,595 --> 00:03:04,635
you have the incorporate bond.

59
00:03:04,645 --> 00:03:06,575
You didn't give two wet shits

60
00:03:06,585 --> 00:03:08,205
when it was Eliot's life on the line,

61
00:03:08,215 --> 00:03:11,205
and now that it's Julia
you're suddenly leaning in?

62
00:03:11,215 --> 00:03:12,855
Look, we all care about both of them,

63
00:03:12,865 --> 00:03:14,855
but based on Mayakovsky's formula

64
00:03:14,865 --> 00:03:17,125
casting an incorporate bond
strong enough to hold a God

65
00:03:17,135 --> 00:03:19,215
would take an insane amount of power.

66
00:03:19,225 --> 00:03:20,605
No, we'd need twice as much.

67
00:03:20,615 --> 00:03:22,215
If we go in there without enough juice

68
00:03:22,225 --> 00:03:23,865
they'll... they'll just body hop.

69
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,745
- They'll kill us all.
- Great.

70
00:03:26,755 --> 00:03:30,095
Where the hell are we gonna
find that kind of magic?

71
00:03:30,105 --> 00:03:31,875
Hey, Dean.

72
00:03:31,885 --> 00:03:34,795
I would not go in your office
right now, if I were you.

73
00:03:34,805 --> 00:03:37,275
If you shit
in my private bathroom again...

74
00:03:37,285 --> 00:03:39,055
No, well, see, there's kind of

75
00:03:39,065 --> 00:03:41,795
a few Librarian dudes here
to arrest you.

76
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:44,885
Yeah, they're pretty pissed
about some lecture you gave

77
00:03:44,895 --> 00:03:47,065
while you were pissed.

78
00:03:47,075 --> 00:03:48,855
I've been expecting them.

79
00:03:48,865 --> 00:03:51,245
Come with me.

80
00:03:53,035 --> 00:03:55,985
Thank Christ I wore
the right suit today.

81
00:03:55,995 --> 00:03:58,995
The right suit
for being arrested, or...?

82
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:01,605
Wait...

83
00:04:01,615 --> 00:04:02,735
Are you still drunk?

84
00:04:02,745 --> 00:04:04,645
That's entirely beside the point.

85
00:04:04,655 --> 00:04:05,885
We have a bigger problem.

86
00:04:05,895 --> 00:04:08,175
Kady and Zelda haven't
returned from the Poison Room,

87
00:04:08,185 --> 00:04:11,585
- and they're running out of time.
- Oh, shit.

88
00:04:12,145 --> 00:04:14,045
Who are they, and what does
that mean, exactly?

89
00:04:14,055 --> 00:04:16,375
- God damn it, focus, Todd.
- Yes.

90
00:04:16,385 --> 00:04:18,165
If I'm going to be arrested,
there still maybe be a chance

91
00:04:18,185 --> 00:04:19,795
that something good can come from it.

92
00:04:19,805 --> 00:04:21,195
Here.

93
00:04:25,155 --> 00:04:28,065
Yes, here. Take this to the
Library book club immediately.

94
00:04:28,075 --> 00:04:31,065
- Tell no one, do you understand?
- Sure, keep it "confidench."

95
00:04:31,075 --> 00:04:34,935
- On it.
- And try not to "Todd" this up.

96
00:04:34,945 --> 00:04:38,425
I will try not to be myself.

97
00:04:51,005 --> 00:04:53,955
Well, so much for getting Fogg's help.

98
00:05:02,105 --> 00:05:05,145
Well, that's the last of our protection.

99
00:05:06,325 --> 00:05:08,325
On the upside...

100
00:05:08,335 --> 00:05:09,715
tasted minty fresh.

101
00:05:10,985 --> 00:05:13,365
Let's go.

102
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:18,155
Wait.

103
00:05:18,165 --> 00:05:20,685
What the hell?

104
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:31,905
Hello, there.

105
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:34,825
Apologies, I was trying
not to startle you.

106
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:37,005
Christopher Plover. Pleasure.

107
00:05:37,015 --> 00:05:38,965
The children's book author?

108
00:05:38,975 --> 00:05:41,355
Oh, you're familiar with my work.

109
00:05:41,365 --> 00:05:42,395
You could say that.

110
00:05:42,405 --> 00:05:44,185
I've read Martin Chatwin's book.

111
00:05:44,195 --> 00:05:47,355
Yes, well, not exactly
the highlight of my oath.

112
00:05:47,365 --> 00:05:50,365
Oh, you're the pervert
who turned him into The Beast.

113
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:54,415
And the man who survived
in this place for weeks.

114
00:05:54,425 --> 00:05:56,195
And I can show you how...

115
00:05:56,295 --> 00:05:58,485
if you help me escape.

116
00:06:03,437 --> 00:06:05,387
Look, it sucks
that Fogg's out of "comish,"

117
00:06:05,397 --> 00:06:06,697
but who else can we shake down?

118
00:06:07,206 --> 00:06:09,156
Kady was trying to find
the Library stockpile.

119
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,976
If we knew where that was...

120
00:06:10,986 --> 00:06:13,026
Found magic, need help!

121
00:06:13,036 --> 00:06:14,246
Who sent you?

122
00:06:14,256 --> 00:06:16,856
- Found magic, need help!
- Okay, where?

123
00:06:16,866 --> 00:06:18,906
- Vague as shit.
- Oh, sorry.

124
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,816
It's Fen.

125
00:06:24,396 --> 00:06:25,857
Right this way.

126
00:06:25,882 --> 00:06:28,052
High King Fen awaits.

127
00:06:41,892 --> 00:06:44,102
Whoa.

128
00:06:51,122 --> 00:06:54,152
Sort of incredible.

129
00:06:54,162 --> 00:06:55,942
Trippy.

130
00:06:55,952 --> 00:06:58,772
Oh, good, you're here.

131
00:06:58,782 --> 00:07:00,292
Fen, what is this?

132
00:07:00,302 --> 00:07:02,202
And what's with the fish?

133
00:07:02,212 --> 00:07:04,472
Follow me, come on.

134
00:07:11,482 --> 00:07:14,912
Holy shit.

135
00:07:14,922 --> 00:07:16,662
This is the reservoir?

136
00:07:16,672 --> 00:07:18,352
Ocean of pure magic.

137
00:07:18,362 --> 00:07:21,052
Pretty amazing, right?

138
00:07:21,062 --> 00:07:23,092
I found it. Well, Josh and me.

139
00:07:23,102 --> 00:07:27,232
And Tik was there too, I guess.
But, no, a lot of it was me.

140
00:07:28,022 --> 00:07:30,452
One small problem...

141
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:33,712
don't touch it!
That's the tiny little problem.

142
00:07:33,722 --> 00:07:36,932
It seems to be protected
by some sort of curse.

143
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,332
Look what it did to Josh.

144
00:07:40,342 --> 00:07:42,662
You're saying Josh is a fucking fish?

145
00:07:42,672 --> 00:07:44,122
Well, of course not.

146
00:07:44,132 --> 00:07:45,862
He's a Fillorian Dying Fish.

147
00:07:45,872 --> 00:07:49,302
A Fillorian Fucking Fish
is a totally different species.

148
00:07:49,312 --> 00:07:51,392
Wait, "Dying Fish"?

149
00:07:51,402 --> 00:07:53,522
I really hope that's a metaphor.

150
00:07:53,532 --> 00:07:56,532
Nope, they only live a couple days.

151
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:58,312
And you're sure that's Josh?

152
00:07:58,322 --> 00:07:59,882
Oh, I saw it happen.

153
00:07:59,892 --> 00:08:01,972
We were gonna come straight to you guys,

154
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,362
tell you all about how we saved the day,

155
00:08:04,372 --> 00:08:08,362
and then he touches the water
and next thing I know, boom.

156
00:08:08,372 --> 00:08:09,502
Josh Fish.

157
00:08:09,512 --> 00:08:12,192
Him and his damn showmanship.

158
00:08:13,382 --> 00:08:14,892
So is it bad if it turns white?

159
00:08:14,902 --> 00:08:17,022
Great Umber's taint.

160
00:08:17,032 --> 00:08:18,372
What are you doing?

161
00:08:18,382 --> 00:08:21,072
Dying Fish need eye contact,

162
00:08:21,082 --> 00:08:22,512
almost constantly.

163
00:08:22,522 --> 00:08:24,292
Usually they get it
from their fish moms,

164
00:08:24,302 --> 00:08:26,342
but we'll have to fill in.

165
00:08:26,352 --> 00:08:30,122
Every pet I ever had ended up
in a shoebox or the toilet.

166
00:08:30,132 --> 00:08:31,342
This one's all you.

167
00:08:31,352 --> 00:08:34,002
It's just until we figure out how
to turn him back into a person.

168
00:08:34,012 --> 00:08:35,612
Or the rest of his life.

169
00:08:35,622 --> 00:08:37,442
I'm not babysitting Nemo

170
00:08:37,452 --> 00:08:40,262
when we're this close to saving Eliot.

171
00:08:40,272 --> 00:08:41,672
I've got bigger fish to fry.

172
00:08:41,682 --> 00:08:44,012
Shh, Margo!

173
00:08:44,022 --> 00:08:46,582
Don't say "fry" and "fish."

174
00:08:49,412 --> 00:08:52,362
It's not working.
He's not getting better.

175
00:08:52,372 --> 00:08:54,282
Margo, please.

176
00:08:54,292 --> 00:08:56,502
For Josh?

177
00:08:56,512 --> 00:08:58,852
Damn it.

178
00:09:00,342 --> 00:09:03,072
So I just look at him?

179
00:09:06,392 --> 00:09:08,122
My Gods.

180
00:09:08,132 --> 00:09:09,472
He perked right up.

181
00:09:11,872 --> 00:09:15,042
He's bonded to you.

182
00:09:15,052 --> 00:09:18,092
He thinks you're his mother.

183
00:09:18,102 --> 00:09:22,052
Unfortunately, that's not
the first time that's happened.

184
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:25,222
Closest thing to the reservoir
in the books is the Secret Sea.

185
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:26,872
It's an underground ocean.

186
00:09:26,892 --> 00:09:28,492
Chatwins sailed across it

187
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:31,662
with a crew full of rabbit pirates.

188
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:33,882
Are those pirates who steal rabbits,

189
00:09:33,892 --> 00:09:35,362
or pirates who are rabbits?

190
00:09:35,372 --> 00:09:36,452
Kind of both.

191
00:09:36,462 --> 00:09:38,542
But it doesn't say anything

192
00:09:38,552 --> 00:09:41,502
about the Secret Sea
being full of magic or cursed,

193
00:09:41,512 --> 00:09:44,422
so I... maybe there's a clue
that I'm missing.

194
00:09:44,432 --> 00:09:47,112
And if your nerdy bullshit
leads us nowhere?

195
00:09:47,122 --> 00:09:48,292
We need a back-up plan.

196
00:09:48,302 --> 00:09:49,422
Speaking of bunnies,

197
00:09:49,432 --> 00:09:51,252
where are the ones that Fen sent?

198
00:09:51,262 --> 00:09:52,642
I have an idea.

199
00:09:52,652 --> 00:09:55,952
So do all rabbits talk, or...?

200
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:58,562
Some of them you have
to bribe with cigarettes first.

201
00:09:58,572 --> 00:09:59,771
Look, about my message...

202
00:09:59,772 --> 00:10:01,482
No, I know. I owe you.

203
00:10:01,492 --> 00:10:04,172
But I can't slip you that kind of power

204
00:10:04,182 --> 00:10:05,262
behind the Order's back.

205
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:07,002
The monsters have two of my friends,

206
00:10:07,012 --> 00:10:09,532
and who knows what kind
of chaos they're causing

207
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,052
while the Library does nothing.

208
00:10:11,062 --> 00:10:13,012
Look, Alice...

209
00:10:13,022 --> 00:10:16,582
I am not stranger
to messing up a good thing.

210
00:10:16,592 --> 00:10:19,282
I'm not gonna do that with the Library.

211
00:10:19,292 --> 00:10:20,771
Well, if we don't do something,

212
00:10:20,772 --> 00:10:22,452
there might not be a Library anymore.

213
00:10:22,462 --> 00:10:23,892
Then why don't you work with us?

214
00:10:23,902 --> 00:10:26,552
Because your bosses would
arrest all of us on sight.

215
00:10:26,562 --> 00:10:27,982
You wanna do some good?

216
00:10:27,992 --> 00:10:30,472
This is your best chance.

217
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:35,002
I hope you find what you need, Alice.

218
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:39,952
We're not setting him loose.

219
00:10:39,962 --> 00:10:43,042
All we're promising is to take
him with us if we find an exit.

220
00:10:43,052 --> 00:10:44,482
Well?

221
00:10:44,492 --> 00:10:47,132
Do we have a deal?

222
00:10:52,622 --> 00:10:53,882
Moss?

223
00:10:53,892 --> 00:10:56,972
My theory is it counteracts the poison.

224
00:10:56,982 --> 00:10:58,972
Probably why it's
the only other living thing

225
00:10:58,982 --> 00:11:00,582
in this place.

226
00:11:00,592 --> 00:11:03,232
Been eating it since I got here

227
00:11:03,242 --> 00:11:05,112
and I'm as healthy as a horse.

228
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:08,112
How did you get here?

229
00:11:08,122 --> 00:11:10,022
Former prisoner of yours,

230
00:11:10,032 --> 00:11:12,162
Alice Quinn...

231
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:15,122
seemed to think this was
the place I deserved to be.

232
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,642
I can't say I disagree.

233
00:11:16,652 --> 00:11:20,082
Don't bite the hand
that feeds you, dear.

234
00:11:20,092 --> 00:11:22,252
Shall we?

235
00:11:31,712 --> 00:11:35,352
At least give me my dignity.

236
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:36,622
Sorry.

237
00:11:36,632 --> 00:11:38,182
Protocol.

238
00:11:38,192 --> 00:11:41,502
Well, this was a new suit.

239
00:11:42,462 --> 00:11:44,232
It's a bit loud.

240
00:11:44,242 --> 00:11:46,542
Yes.

241
00:11:46,552 --> 00:11:48,172
It certainly is.

242
00:12:08,246 --> 00:12:10,976
Damn, the history of this
place is depressing as shit.

243
00:12:11,036 --> 00:12:14,528
Most world histories are.

244
00:12:14,615 --> 00:12:16,905
Nothing about a way out.

245
00:12:16,915 --> 00:12:19,125
Kady?

246
00:12:19,135 --> 00:12:21,215
Oh, shit.

247
00:12:23,185 --> 00:12:24,395
What?

248
00:12:24,405 --> 00:12:26,395
The moss should have
protected you from...

249
00:12:28,555 --> 00:12:30,145
Oh.

250
00:12:30,155 --> 00:12:32,105
"Oh," what?

251
00:12:32,115 --> 00:12:34,495
The age-suspensions spells

252
00:12:34,505 --> 00:12:37,415
Martin used to keep me alive
while he tortured me...

253
00:12:37,425 --> 00:12:39,155
it must still be keeping me alive.

254
00:12:39,165 --> 00:12:40,465
Perfect.

255
00:12:40,475 --> 00:12:43,815
So I'm gonna die in the most
ironic way possible.

256
00:12:43,825 --> 00:12:46,125
Just like Penny.

257
00:12:46,345 --> 00:12:48,015
Well...

258
00:12:48,795 --> 00:12:51,355
not necessarily.

259
00:12:51,365 --> 00:12:53,955
If we get back in time...

260
00:12:55,835 --> 00:12:56,945
Wait...

261
00:12:57,435 --> 00:13:00,955
All this time...

262
00:13:01,225 --> 00:13:02,885
the Library had a cure?

263
00:13:02,895 --> 00:13:05,405
- Kady...
- No, you...

264
00:13:05,415 --> 00:13:06,915
you chose...

265
00:13:06,975 --> 00:13:08,665
not to save Penny?

266
00:13:08,675 --> 00:13:10,825
- If it were up to me...
- It was.

267
00:13:10,835 --> 00:13:12,355
It's called "The Poison Room."

268
00:13:12,365 --> 00:13:14,315
The name is a warning
Penny chose to ignore.

269
00:13:14,325 --> 00:13:17,575
No, no, no, you don't get
to hide behind the Library.

270
00:13:17,585 --> 00:13:20,405
You think if you're a cog
in a fascist machine

271
00:13:20,415 --> 00:13:23,185
that you're not responsible
for the people that it kills?

272
00:13:23,195 --> 00:13:24,665
I'll admit, the Library veered

273
00:13:24,675 --> 00:13:27,545
in an authoritarian direction.

274
00:13:27,555 --> 00:13:28,935
Because of Everett.

275
00:13:28,945 --> 00:13:30,375
Once we remove him from power...

276
00:13:30,385 --> 00:13:32,185
No, no, it is not just Everett.

277
00:13:32,205 --> 00:13:34,375
It's the whole god damn Order.

278
00:13:34,385 --> 00:13:36,945
It all needs to be burned down.

279
00:13:36,955 --> 00:13:39,375
Not if it can be reformed.

280
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:42,425
Look, as... as someone who lived through

281
00:13:42,435 --> 00:13:44,205
two world wars, I can tell you,

282
00:13:44,215 --> 00:13:46,475
authoritarian regimes,
they fail eventually.

283
00:13:46,485 --> 00:13:48,775
See? Look, even the
pedophile agrees with me.

284
00:13:48,785 --> 00:13:50,865
Oh, hardly.

285
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,695
Problem is...

286
00:13:53,705 --> 00:13:56,355
no one will ever let you change.

287
00:13:56,365 --> 00:13:58,985
People always see you
for what you've done,

288
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,705
never for who you are.

289
00:14:00,715 --> 00:14:02,405
So at the end of the day,

290
00:14:02,415 --> 00:14:05,124
no matter what you try to become,
some judgmental blonde bitch

291
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,325
always shoves you down a poison well.

292
00:14:07,335 --> 00:14:09,405
Yeah?

293
00:14:10,815 --> 00:14:12,895
Well, then I'm Team Blonde Bitch.

294
00:14:20,615 --> 00:14:22,905
- Where's Fen?
- I sent her out for fish flakes

295
00:14:22,915 --> 00:14:24,645
three hours ago.

296
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:27,525
Wait, you sent her out alone
in Manhattan?

297
00:14:27,535 --> 00:14:28,695
Well, I kind of implied

298
00:14:28,705 --> 00:14:30,615
it was her fault Josh was a fish

299
00:14:30,625 --> 00:14:33,045
and blah, blah, blah,
I'd blame her forever,

300
00:14:33,055 --> 00:14:35,925
so she's cooling off at Benihana.

301
00:14:35,935 --> 00:14:39,055
She never could resist a sharp knife.

302
00:14:39,065 --> 00:14:42,124
Meanwhile, I'm trying
to read up on a damn cure

303
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:43,585
while maintaining constant eye contact

304
00:14:43,595 --> 00:14:45,625
with an anchovy.

305
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,625
And they say girls
are the ones who get needy

306
00:14:47,635 --> 00:14:49,585
once you fuck them.

307
00:14:49,595 --> 00:14:51,635
Wait... wait, you and Josh...

308
00:14:51,645 --> 00:14:53,025
Wait, you know about

309
00:14:53,035 --> 00:14:55,675
the little werewolf stuff, right?

310
00:14:55,685 --> 00:14:57,555
Who gives a shit?

311
00:14:57,565 --> 00:14:59,505
- Nothing matters.
- Okay.

312
00:14:59,515 --> 00:15:02,075
Look, it's not a big deal, all right?

313
00:15:02,085 --> 00:15:03,515
Sometimes we bang.

314
00:15:03,525 --> 00:15:04,995
He makes me laugh.

315
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:08,085
And I like having him around 'cause
of the aforementioned banging,

316
00:15:08,095 --> 00:15:09,865
and he just... you know,
he kind of gets me.

317
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,655
So what?

318
00:15:11,665 --> 00:15:13,915
It's not like I'm in love
with Josh Hoberman.

319
00:15:13,925 --> 00:15:16,745
It kinda sounds like you are, though.

320
00:15:16,755 --> 00:15:18,705
Have you met me?

321
00:15:18,715 --> 00:15:21,095
I don't do feelings.

322
00:15:21,105 --> 00:15:23,665
I'm the bitch with the ice axes.

323
00:15:23,675 --> 00:15:25,885
Well, you can still care about a guy...

324
00:15:25,895 --> 00:15:28,845
werewolf, fish...

325
00:15:28,905 --> 00:15:31,155
and it doesn't make you any less you.

326
00:15:31,165 --> 00:15:34,085
I mean, you can still be
a bitch if you want to.

327
00:15:35,085 --> 00:15:36,915
Shit.

328
00:15:38,655 --> 00:15:41,435
Maybe I do love this goddamn guppy.

329
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:46,224
Uh, I think this is the hedge doctor

330
00:15:46,225 --> 00:15:47,785
that Kady called to fix Pete.

331
00:15:47,795 --> 00:15:48,915
Says he's a veterinarian.

332
00:15:48,925 --> 00:15:51,175
Maybe he can help with the fish-Josh.

333
00:15:51,185 --> 00:15:52,615
Josh-fish.

334
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,925
Way to be useful, Coldwater.

335
00:15:57,935 --> 00:15:59,705
Is this Gordy?

336
00:15:59,715 --> 00:16:02,455
Yeah, I've got fish problems.

337
00:16:07,245 --> 00:16:09,115
- Josh and Margo.
- Yeah.

338
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:19,855
Okay, here's my thing:

339
00:16:19,865 --> 00:16:21,955
Um...

340
00:16:23,265 --> 00:16:26,835
I didn't think that I could
ever trust you again.

341
00:16:28,045 --> 00:16:30,735
And now...

342
00:16:30,745 --> 00:16:32,045
"And now"?

343
00:16:32,965 --> 00:16:35,835
I find myself wanting to.

344
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,195
When we first met...

345
00:16:52,205 --> 00:16:55,675
I was clinging onto some...

346
00:16:55,685 --> 00:16:59,645
naive, idealistic notions
of what the world should be.

347
00:17:01,035 --> 00:17:03,605
How people should be.

348
00:17:05,175 --> 00:17:07,825
And I think that I have realized...

349
00:17:09,525 --> 00:17:13,735
If I just throw away
all that childish bullshit,

350
00:17:13,745 --> 00:17:16,825
I can forgive people...

351
00:17:18,615 --> 00:17:22,485
For not living up
to my stupid expectations.

352
00:17:23,615 --> 00:17:25,915
Like yourself?

353
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,155
What if we tried again?

354
00:17:35,675 --> 00:17:39,145
I want you in my life, Alice.

355
00:17:39,155 --> 00:17:41,685
I want that, too.

356
00:17:52,955 --> 00:17:55,945
Cyrus.

357
00:17:55,955 --> 00:17:58,945
There was an intrusion
in the Poison Room.

358
00:17:58,955 --> 00:18:01,165
It's Zelda.

359
00:18:01,175 --> 00:18:04,005
With a hedge witch.

360
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:06,355
Did you follow protocol?

361
00:18:06,365 --> 00:18:09,575
Yes, they're locked in.

362
00:18:09,585 --> 00:18:12,575
But do we really just
leave her to die in there?

363
00:18:22,775 --> 00:18:24,895
How long do you think we have?

364
00:18:24,905 --> 00:18:26,245
If we got out now?

365
00:18:26,255 --> 00:18:29,245
A few days.

366
00:18:29,255 --> 00:18:31,245
In here?

367
00:18:31,255 --> 00:18:33,595
A few hours.

368
00:18:33,605 --> 00:18:36,865
The after-effects of the bugs
slowed the...

369
00:18:36,875 --> 00:18:37,995
Zelda?

370
00:18:38,005 --> 00:18:40,345
Shit.

371
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:51,005
Sorry to knock you out like that.

372
00:18:51,015 --> 00:18:53,705
It's the only way we could talk.

373
00:19:02,635 --> 00:19:04,285
You could have freed me.

374
00:19:04,295 --> 00:19:07,675
You brought a hedge witch into
our most protected archive.

375
00:19:07,685 --> 00:19:09,195
I read your book.

376
00:19:09,205 --> 00:19:10,815
You're hoarding magic.

377
00:19:10,825 --> 00:19:12,115
Trying to become a God.

378
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,335
Why?

379
00:19:13,345 --> 00:19:16,855
I put in centuries of work before
you ever knew the Library existed.

380
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:18,815
Oh, so I wouldn't understand.

381
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,255
No, you should understand.

382
00:19:20,265 --> 00:19:22,385
How...

383
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:24,345
Futile it all is.

384
00:19:24,355 --> 00:19:27,135
We work so hard to protect
the flame of knowledge,

385
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:30,305
but there will always be things
we can't understand.

386
00:19:30,315 --> 00:19:31,965
Knowledge of the Gods.

387
00:19:31,975 --> 00:19:33,315
By becoming one of them,

388
00:19:33,325 --> 00:19:35,265
I can rip their secrets away from them

389
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:37,225
and bring them back to the Library.

390
00:19:37,235 --> 00:19:38,835
At what cost?

391
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:41,755
An unkillable God
is on the loose as we speak.

392
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:44,935
In the body of Eliot Waugh.

393
00:19:44,945 --> 00:19:46,415
You intend to take his power.

394
00:19:46,425 --> 00:19:49,155
He has the power to destroy everything,

395
00:19:49,165 --> 00:19:51,115
and all we have are books.

396
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:54,725
If we want to face that kind
of threat, we need power too.

397
00:20:08,925 --> 00:20:11,525
Isn't that what Bacchus and
the others were trying to do?

398
00:20:11,535 --> 00:20:13,265
They got drunk on their own power.

399
00:20:13,275 --> 00:20:14,525
Some of them literally.

400
00:20:14,535 --> 00:20:17,365
What makes you think you won't fall prey
to the same hubris?

401
00:20:17,405 --> 00:20:20,005
Well, I thought I had you.

402
00:20:25,155 --> 00:20:27,885
Excuse me, but isn't this book banned?

403
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:30,805
Like, really, really banned?

404
00:20:30,815 --> 00:20:32,105
Fuck me.

405
00:20:32,115 --> 00:20:34,065
Uh, we need to get that
to the Poison Room.

406
00:20:34,075 --> 00:20:36,945
Immediately. Now, now, now.

407
00:21:09,465 --> 00:21:11,495
You wanted me...

408
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,765
To do what, exactly?

409
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,245
To take over the Library once I'm gone.

410
00:21:18,255 --> 00:21:21,205
To see to the human concerns,

411
00:21:21,215 --> 00:21:23,765
and to fix my mistakes

412
00:21:23,775 --> 00:21:27,255
with the benefit of all the knowledge
and the power I would bring.

413
00:21:27,265 --> 00:21:29,775
I wish you'd told me the truth sooner.

414
00:21:29,785 --> 00:21:31,955
So do I.

415
00:21:31,965 --> 00:21:33,515
So...

416
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:36,255
do what you must.

417
00:21:36,265 --> 00:21:37,565
Follow protocol.

418
00:21:37,575 --> 00:21:41,095
There is a way you can still help me.

419
00:21:41,105 --> 00:21:44,005
I redirected the power I need
into a reservoir,

420
00:21:44,015 --> 00:21:46,095
but it triggered a protective spell.

421
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:47,445
A puzzle I can't solve.

422
00:21:47,455 --> 00:21:49,445
But I've discovered someone who can.

423
00:21:49,455 --> 00:21:51,575
Quentin Coldwater.

424
00:21:52,635 --> 00:21:54,495
Get Quentin to open the reservoir,

425
00:21:54,505 --> 00:21:56,455
and the Library can still be
yours to lead if...

426
00:21:58,815 --> 00:22:00,505
Did you slap me?

427
00:22:00,515 --> 00:22:03,155
We need to move, fast.

428
00:22:03,165 --> 00:22:04,465
No.

429
00:22:04,475 --> 00:22:06,654
I didn't risk my life
to save a child molester.

430
00:22:06,655 --> 00:22:08,035
- He can stay.
- What?

431
00:22:08,045 --> 00:22:09,985
No!

432
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,995
We had a deal! Tell him!

433
00:22:12,005 --> 00:22:15,125
Well, your moss
didn't do shit for us, so...

434
00:22:15,135 --> 00:22:18,175
But, uh... but I can help you
get to the reservoir.

435
00:22:19,835 --> 00:22:23,135
It... it was a secret
of Martin's, and...

436
00:22:23,145 --> 00:22:25,095
I know all his secrets.

437
00:22:25,105 --> 00:22:27,485
I could share them with you.

438
00:22:35,025 --> 00:22:37,405
Incursion protocol. They're patrolling.

439
00:22:37,415 --> 00:22:39,585
Come on.

440
00:22:44,515 --> 00:22:46,415
Get to the earth fountain,
I'll hold them off.

441
00:22:46,425 --> 00:22:48,895
Go!

442
00:22:58,355 --> 00:22:59,515
Damn it.

443
00:22:59,525 --> 00:23:01,305
Quite a trip you sent me on.

444
00:23:04,005 --> 00:23:06,345
You ruined my suit.

445
00:23:06,355 --> 00:23:09,355
But the good news is...

446
00:23:09,365 --> 00:23:11,575
you're just about my size.

447
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:20,639
Keep barking, you Schnauzer fuck.

448
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,549
It won't bring back your balls.

449
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,559
God, I hate animals.

450
00:23:25,569 --> 00:23:27,559
So...

451
00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:31,559
- goldfish troubles?
- Not exactly.

452
00:23:32,849 --> 00:23:34,499
I see.

453
00:23:34,509 --> 00:23:35,659
Not a goldfish.

454
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:37,239
Some kind of hybrid?

455
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,069
Oh, my God.

456
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:41,149
I am sorry to be the bearer of bad news,

457
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:45,119
but your fish is a werewolf.

458
00:23:45,129 --> 00:23:46,599
Wait.

459
00:23:46,609 --> 00:23:48,509
So are you.

460
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:51,989
Did... did you fuck this fish?

461
00:23:51,999 --> 00:23:54,339
Look, he's a human who's been cursed,

462
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,079
and I need to know how to undo it.

463
00:23:56,089 --> 00:23:58,519
Well, it's definitely not a hedge spell.

464
00:23:58,529 --> 00:23:59,859
And without knowing how it was cast,

465
00:23:59,879 --> 00:24:01,559
not much I can do about it.

466
00:24:01,569 --> 00:24:03,609
So, should I just go ahead
and flush it, or...

467
00:24:03,619 --> 00:24:05,569
Again, he's a person.

468
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:08,269
I'm gonna need you to try
a little harder, all right?

469
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:10,619
Now, if I look away
for literally ten seconds

470
00:24:10,629 --> 00:24:13,219
he starts to die, and at some
point I'm gonna need to sleep

471
00:24:13,239 --> 00:24:16,849
or drop a deuce,
and I don't allow spectators.

472
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:20,089
Yeah, there is some kind

473
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:21,529
of bond happening there.

474
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:22,749
Whoa.

475
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:26,099
Your eye is crazy.

476
00:24:26,109 --> 00:24:27,879
Is that a wolf thing, or...

477
00:24:27,889 --> 00:24:29,449
Fairy thing.

478
00:24:29,459 --> 00:24:31,279
Can we focus on fish boy, please?

479
00:24:31,289 --> 00:24:33,189
It's not even attached to your head.

480
00:24:33,199 --> 00:24:35,149
You ever pop it out?

481
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:37,979
Why the shit would I pop out
my own eyeball, Gordy?

482
00:24:37,989 --> 00:24:40,939
So you can point it

483
00:24:40,949 --> 00:24:42,289
at your gilled lover

484
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:44,939
while you attend to...

485
00:24:44,999 --> 00:24:46,439
lady business.

486
00:24:52,309 --> 00:24:53,909
I don't know, man.

487
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,479
It feels pretty stuck in there.

488
00:24:56,489 --> 00:24:57,599
Ah!

489
00:25:02,099 --> 00:25:04,269
Holy shit, it's working.

490
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:05,959
I can still see out of it.

491
00:25:05,969 --> 00:25:09,059
You ever touch me again,
I'll pop out your balls.

492
00:25:11,239 --> 00:25:13,939
Uh...

493
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:18,239
See?

494
00:25:18,249 --> 00:25:20,239
Problem solved.

495
00:25:20,249 --> 00:25:21,409
I don't know.

496
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:24,109
This seems kind of problematic.

497
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:26,819
Oh, I got just the thing.

498
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:32,369
Really?

499
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:37,819
Why does a veterinarian have
a pirate-themed eye patch?

500
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:41,359
Maybe it's best we don't ask
a lot of follow-up questions.

501
00:25:43,969 --> 00:25:45,529
Jesus, what happened to you?

502
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:47,349
Hey.

503
00:25:48,629 --> 00:25:50,049
- Just...
- Hello, Alice.

504
00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:52,139
- Thought he was dead.
- Why'd you bring him here?

505
00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:54,879
Because I just might be
the only person alive

506
00:25:54,889 --> 00:25:56,539
who knows how to access the reservoir

507
00:25:56,549 --> 00:25:59,019
and save your friends.

508
00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:01,889
Mm.

509
00:26:01,899 --> 00:26:03,499
Okay, so the... the reservoir.

510
00:26:03,509 --> 00:26:05,939
Yes, well, that's what Martin called it.

511
00:26:05,949 --> 00:26:07,369
I thought it lacked

512
00:26:07,379 --> 00:26:09,849
a certain poetry.

513
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:12,549
So I renamed it the Secret Sea.

514
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,639
Right, the fourth...
the fourth "Fillory" book.

515
00:26:14,649 --> 00:26:15,669
Mm.

516
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,249
Oh, I see you have a copy here.

517
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:20,129
Ah.

518
00:26:20,139 --> 00:26:22,389
Oh, first edition.

519
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:24,429
- That must be valuable.
- Yes.

520
00:26:24,439 --> 00:26:26,219
Well...

521
00:26:26,229 --> 00:26:28,089
even more so now.

522
00:26:32,539 --> 00:26:34,139
The Watcherwoman in the books,

523
00:26:34,149 --> 00:26:36,829
she was...

524
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:38,809
trying to steal all of magic
for herself, right?

525
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:40,319
And then... and then Martin stops her.

526
00:26:40,329 --> 00:26:43,279
Most of that book is pure tosh.

527
00:26:43,289 --> 00:26:46,279
I had to invent that plot
from the whole class.

528
00:26:46,289 --> 00:26:50,239
It's... well, I couldn't exactly
publish the stories

529
00:26:50,249 --> 00:26:52,239
as the children
told them to me, could I?

530
00:26:52,249 --> 00:26:53,679
I mean, the "Flying Forest,"

531
00:26:53,689 --> 00:26:57,899
where the Chatwins discovered
recreational drug use?

532
00:26:57,909 --> 00:27:01,599
Poor little Jane hearing about
the birds and the bees from a...

533
00:27:01,609 --> 00:27:05,339
did you know that centaurs
view necrophilia

534
00:27:05,349 --> 00:27:07,559
as a way of honoring the dead?

535
00:27:07,569 --> 00:27:09,479
Don't think I'd get a Carnegie Medal

536
00:27:09,489 --> 00:27:11,439
for explaining that to children.

537
00:27:11,449 --> 00:27:13,349
I mean, then there's all the...

538
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:15,619
all the exaggerations and the lies.

539
00:27:15,629 --> 00:27:19,269
I mean, Martin slaying
a dozen mercenaries,

540
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,189
and Jane riding on top of a horse,

541
00:27:22,199 --> 00:27:24,229
what, 100 feet tall?

542
00:27:24,239 --> 00:27:25,709
I mean, what did she call it?

543
00:27:25,719 --> 00:27:28,109
- Cozy Horse.
- "Cozy Horse."

544
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:30,459
Utter nonsense thrown in there

545
00:27:30,469 --> 00:27:32,719
just to see how much
they'd get me to believe,

546
00:27:32,729 --> 00:27:34,719
and then Jane insisted I keep it.

547
00:27:34,729 --> 00:27:38,249
In real life, the ending was...
was much darker.

548
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:41,209
Oh, Martin did stop
the Watcherwoman, that's true.

549
00:27:41,219 --> 00:27:43,689
The Secret Sea was built

550
00:27:43,699 --> 00:27:45,649
by the 13th king of Fillory

551
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:48,129
to consolidate power for himself.

552
00:27:48,139 --> 00:27:51,429
Martin wanted to make sure
that no one ever tried

553
00:27:51,439 --> 00:27:55,219
to do the same thing again
so he drained the Secret Sea,

554
00:27:55,229 --> 00:27:58,219
using the last few drops to set a trap

555
00:27:58,229 --> 00:28:01,179
for anyone who might
one day try to refill it.

556
00:28:01,189 --> 00:28:03,099
A... a curse.

557
00:28:03,109 --> 00:28:05,489
Right, so now one
of our friends is a fish.

558
00:28:05,499 --> 00:28:08,449
Well, he was 13 at the time.

559
00:28:08,459 --> 00:28:10,019
You have to forgive

560
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:12,499
his rather adolescent sense of humor.

561
00:28:12,509 --> 00:28:14,539
- You know how to fix it?
- Mm-hmm.

562
00:28:14,549 --> 00:28:17,369
There's a garden
just outside the reservoir.

563
00:28:17,379 --> 00:28:20,199
The Drowned Garden, Martin called it.

564
00:28:20,209 --> 00:28:22,549
Never did know why.

565
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,339
It reacts to your emotions.

566
00:28:25,349 --> 00:28:28,039
If you're happy, a flower blooms.

567
00:28:28,049 --> 00:28:30,519
If you're sad, another one.

568
00:28:30,529 --> 00:28:32,779
So one of the plants is the antidote?

569
00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:35,049
Indeed.

570
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:38,309
To make it bloom...

571
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:41,409
you have to truly love Fillory.

572
00:28:47,109 --> 00:28:50,319
Maybe when I was 12, but...

573
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:52,359
I don't know, Fillory's taken away

574
00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:53,709
a lot of the shit I love.

575
00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:56,629
Martin had the same problem.

576
00:28:56,639 --> 00:28:59,199
He returned as an adult and...

577
00:28:59,209 --> 00:29:02,289
could not make the flower bloom.

578
00:29:02,299 --> 00:29:05,249
His innocent love for Fillory

579
00:29:05,259 --> 00:29:07,938
had... had soured.

580
00:29:07,939 --> 00:29:10,029
Think we can all say why.

581
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:12,479
Quentin.

582
00:29:13,659 --> 00:29:16,649
It has to be you.

583
00:29:16,659 --> 00:29:19,389
I'm familiar with your books.

584
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:22,739
Even considering
your recent experiences,

585
00:29:22,749 --> 00:29:25,749
Quentin has the best chance of...

586
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:29,229
making the garden grow.

587
00:29:31,539 --> 00:29:34,149
We don't have much time.

588
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,159
There's a contractor the Library uses

589
00:29:36,169 --> 00:29:37,179
who might be willing to...

590
00:29:37,189 --> 00:29:40,729
Text me if you find somebody.

591
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:51,379
So it's true? The Library has a cure?

592
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:54,379
I know, it's bullshit.

593
00:29:54,389 --> 00:29:56,789
Go with her before it's too late.

594
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,349
If this is some noble shit

595
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:02,219
about you not owing
the Library anything...

596
00:30:06,579 --> 00:30:07,609
Oh.

597
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:09,269
You don't want to be cured.

598
00:30:11,139 --> 00:30:12,579
'Cause for all of the terrible shit

599
00:30:12,589 --> 00:30:14,359
we've been through, at least the upside

600
00:30:14,369 --> 00:30:16,619
is that you know that
there's a life after death

601
00:30:16,629 --> 00:30:19,759
and you get to spend forever
with the other Penny.

602
00:30:19,769 --> 00:30:21,449
And what part of that sounds bad?

603
00:30:21,459 --> 00:30:23,719
The part where you're dead.

604
00:30:25,469 --> 00:30:27,199
I may not know you the way he did,

605
00:30:27,209 --> 00:30:29,399
but I know that that would be
a hell of a waste.

606
00:30:31,689 --> 00:30:34,289
Yeah.

607
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:36,479
Well, most things are.

608
00:30:41,569 --> 00:30:43,909
A lot's changed since I've been gone.

609
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:45,349
Yes.

610
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:48,309
The humans made lots of good stuff.

611
00:30:49,669 --> 00:30:51,919
They spend their small lives
building things

612
00:30:51,929 --> 00:30:54,879
that we could smash in a heartbeat.

613
00:30:54,889 --> 00:30:55,969
Sounds fun.

614
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,489
Perhaps you can tell me...

615
00:30:58,499 --> 00:30:59,879
Do I have a name?

616
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:04,239
Why would you need one?

617
00:31:04,939 --> 00:31:07,499
Starbucks, mostly.

618
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:09,849
This whole time I felt so sorry for you.

619
00:31:09,859 --> 00:31:11,679
Lost and alone.

620
00:31:11,689 --> 00:31:13,939
But you weren't alone.
You were with the humans.

621
00:31:13,949 --> 00:31:16,809
You talk like them, you think like them.

622
00:31:18,689 --> 00:31:20,509
I ate a few of them.

623
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:23,339
Yes, but you care about them.

624
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:32,699
You think I'm disappointed.

625
00:31:32,709 --> 00:31:34,359
I'm not.

626
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,619
Are you scared of me, little brother?

627
00:31:40,629 --> 00:31:42,709
Would I have worked so hard
to bring you back

628
00:31:42,719 --> 00:31:45,319
if I was scared of you?

629
00:31:45,329 --> 00:31:48,799
All I thought about was you.

630
00:31:48,809 --> 00:31:51,629
After I remembered you existed, anyway.

631
00:31:51,639 --> 00:31:54,549
And all I thought about was revenge.

632
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,809
And I got it for you already.

633
00:31:57,819 --> 00:32:00,249
I killed Bacchus.

634
00:32:00,259 --> 00:32:02,339
Iris.

635
00:32:02,349 --> 00:32:04,429
All of them.

636
00:32:04,439 --> 00:32:06,479
Everyone who hurt you.

637
00:32:07,399 --> 00:32:10,209
The question is, who put us here?

638
00:32:13,579 --> 00:32:14,919
Our parents.

639
00:32:14,929 --> 00:32:17,259
They made us, called us mistakes.

640
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:18,739
Abandoned us.

641
00:32:18,749 --> 00:32:21,829
So, what do we do?

642
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:24,269
I like murder as much as anyone,

643
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:26,619
but I did all of this

644
00:32:26,629 --> 00:32:28,839
just to be with you.

645
00:32:28,849 --> 00:32:32,449
Can't we enjoy it
just for a little while?

646
00:32:33,989 --> 00:32:36,178
That's not what we were made for.

647
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:40,219
It's not that I am terrified
of the Old Gods in any way.

648
00:32:40,239 --> 00:32:42,809
It's just, how do you kill

649
00:32:42,819 --> 00:32:45,599
an intangible thought creature?

650
00:32:45,609 --> 00:32:48,689
Where do you even stab?

651
00:32:48,699 --> 00:32:51,429
They're more vulnerable
than you think...

652
00:32:51,439 --> 00:32:53,609
if we can get to their realm.

653
00:32:53,619 --> 00:32:55,779
Which we cannot.

654
00:32:55,789 --> 00:32:59,259
We had a key. A scroll.

655
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:01,789
Found it a very long time ago
on this world.

656
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:02,919
The Order took it from us.

657
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,309
They didn't even know what they had.

658
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,709
Now...

659
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:09,709
where would a bunch of librarians keep

660
00:33:09,719 --> 00:33:13,819
a very, very important scroll?

661
00:33:27,604 --> 00:33:28,814
Oh.

662
00:33:28,858 --> 00:33:30,158
Here.

663
00:33:30,168 --> 00:33:31,678
This has to be it.

664
00:33:31,738 --> 00:33:34,988
It's exactly as Martin described it.

665
00:33:34,998 --> 00:33:38,197
Think... think happy thoughts

666
00:33:38,198 --> 00:33:39,868
about Fillory.

667
00:33:39,878 --> 00:33:41,608
Pure.

668
00:33:41,618 --> 00:33:44,438
Innocent.

669
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:46,138
Maybe try talking to it.

670
00:33:46,148 --> 00:33:49,448
Okay, you just...

671
00:33:52,938 --> 00:33:55,668
Well...

672
00:33:55,678 --> 00:33:58,888
um, Fillory is...

673
00:33:58,898 --> 00:34:00,928
obviously great.

674
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:04,217
Um, you know, talking bears, right?

675
00:34:04,218 --> 00:34:06,028
Who... who could hate that?

676
00:34:06,088 --> 00:34:09,988
And... and opium in the air.

677
00:34:09,998 --> 00:34:11,948
That was...

678
00:34:11,958 --> 00:34:13,818
smart.

679
00:34:13,828 --> 00:34:16,258
And...

680
00:34:16,268 --> 00:34:18,908
socialized centaur medicine.

681
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:19,958
Are we screwed

682
00:34:19,978 --> 00:34:22,108
because Quentin can't
get it up for Fillory?

683
00:34:22,118 --> 00:34:23,918
- Just...
- Look, why don't you try...

684
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:26,797
Okay, no, stop. I can't... look,
you're the one that ruined this.

685
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:30,668
I can't do it with you over my
shoulder, so just... please, just go.

686
00:34:33,718 --> 00:34:35,238
God damn it.

687
00:34:43,728 --> 00:34:45,978
Okay, um...

688
00:34:45,988 --> 00:34:48,548
when I was a kid
I... I loved the Fizzy River

689
00:34:48,558 --> 00:34:50,548
that they found in book two.

690
00:34:50,558 --> 00:34:52,728
And I loved...

691
00:34:52,738 --> 00:34:54,778
I loved the Upside-Down Desert.

692
00:34:54,788 --> 00:34:56,778
You know, the...

693
00:34:56,788 --> 00:35:00,088
I can't really picture it,
but, you know, it sounds...

694
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,788
it sounds cool.

695
00:35:05,748 --> 00:35:07,308
I don't know, I can't... I'm sorry.

696
00:35:07,318 --> 00:35:10,668
- I just... I can't...
- Hey. Hey.

697
00:35:12,148 --> 00:35:14,228
I used to love Fillory when I was a kid

698
00:35:14,238 --> 00:35:17,708
because I didn't know what it was.

699
00:35:17,718 --> 00:35:19,708
Plover left out
all of the terrible shit,

700
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:21,798
and most of the good stuff
he just made up.

701
00:35:21,808 --> 00:35:25,108
Even the fucking Cozy Horse is a lie.

702
00:35:25,118 --> 00:35:26,437
Remember what you told me

703
00:35:26,438 --> 00:35:28,588
about letting go of who you used to be?

704
00:35:28,598 --> 00:35:30,678
I know, I'm trying.

705
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:33,078
Don't.

706
00:35:33,088 --> 00:35:34,598
I don't want you to.

707
00:35:35,908 --> 00:35:38,778
Believing in something...
really believing...

708
00:35:38,788 --> 00:35:40,398
is almost impossible.

709
00:35:42,918 --> 00:35:45,778
But the Quentin I first met...

710
00:35:45,788 --> 00:35:48,608
he believed in magic.

711
00:35:48,618 --> 00:35:50,918
And in Fillory.

712
00:35:50,928 --> 00:35:53,098
He changed.

713
00:35:53,108 --> 00:35:56,008
He grew up.

714
00:35:56,018 --> 00:35:59,098
Being an adult doesn't mean
that you have to throw away

715
00:35:59,108 --> 00:36:00,338
what you used to love.

716
00:36:01,768 --> 00:36:04,628
Then what does it mean?

717
00:36:04,638 --> 00:36:06,918
Seeing the world through new eyes.

718
00:36:12,648 --> 00:36:15,418
And for what it's worth,

719
00:36:15,428 --> 00:36:17,158
the Cozy Horse is real.

720
00:36:17,168 --> 00:36:18,898
I saw it when I was a niffin.

721
00:36:18,908 --> 00:36:21,078
So big you could build a house on it.

722
00:36:23,048 --> 00:36:25,298
So...

723
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,778
let's go.

724
00:36:45,198 --> 00:36:48,118
Okay, it's just you and me.

725
00:36:50,288 --> 00:36:51,558
You know the worst part

726
00:36:51,578 --> 00:36:54,338
of getting exactly what you want?

727
00:36:56,818 --> 00:36:59,298
When it's not good enough.

728
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:03,998
Then what do you do?

729
00:37:06,178 --> 00:37:09,398
If this can't make me happy,
then what would?

730
00:37:14,188 --> 00:37:17,188
Fillory was supposed to mean something.

731
00:37:18,228 --> 00:37:21,888
I was supposed to mean something here.

732
00:37:24,018 --> 00:37:26,008
But it's all... it's just...
it's random.

733
00:37:26,018 --> 00:37:27,058
It's so random

734
00:37:27,068 --> 00:37:29,018
that the only way to save my friends

735
00:37:29,028 --> 00:37:31,858
is to yell at a fucking plant!

736
00:37:35,078 --> 00:37:38,468
Honestly, fuck Fillory
for being so disappointing.

737
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:44,908
You know what, maybe I was better off
just believing that it was fiction.

738
00:37:46,308 --> 00:37:48,508
The idea of Fillory

739
00:37:48,518 --> 00:37:50,618
is what saved my life!

740
00:37:55,008 --> 00:37:58,088
This promise...

741
00:37:58,098 --> 00:38:00,958
that...

742
00:38:00,968 --> 00:38:03,308
people like me...

743
00:38:06,498 --> 00:38:09,798
People like me...

744
00:38:09,808 --> 00:38:12,408
Can somehow...

745
00:38:15,028 --> 00:38:17,068
Find an escape.

746
00:38:20,338 --> 00:38:23,248
There has gotta be some power in that.

747
00:38:25,868 --> 00:38:30,338
Shouldn't loving the idea
of Fillory be enough?

748
00:38:56,328 --> 00:38:58,448
Guys.

749
00:39:00,378 --> 00:39:03,288
Guys, something's happening!

750
00:39:27,878 --> 00:39:30,138
Here's the door.

751
00:40:10,798 --> 00:40:14,098
The key to the realm of the Old Gods.

752
00:40:44,492 --> 00:40:47,012
How the hell does this thing work?

753
00:40:49,622 --> 00:40:51,052
Give this to Margo.

754
00:40:51,062 --> 00:40:54,452
If Plover's right, it should cure Josh.

755
00:40:54,462 --> 00:40:57,412
Monsters in Library!

756
00:41:00,325 --> 00:41:03,145
- Sheila must have sent it.
- Monsters in Library!

757
00:41:03,155 --> 00:41:04,885
All right, we have to
go before they leave.

758
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:06,715
Okay, I'll grab Margo and the axes.

759
00:41:06,775 --> 00:41:08,025
Hey, you sure this is gonna work?

760
00:41:08,035 --> 00:41:09,285
Well, either it will,

761
00:41:09,295 --> 00:41:11,075
or when you come back
we'll both be fish.

762
00:41:11,085 --> 00:41:13,685
Well, that'd be an improvement.

763
00:41:17,565 --> 00:41:20,205
- Okay.
- Okay.

764
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,374
Do you feel anything?

765
00:41:25,384 --> 00:41:27,594
Super stressed out?

766
00:41:27,604 --> 00:41:29,504
Okay.

767
00:41:33,124 --> 00:41:34,394
Ugh.

768
00:41:35,474 --> 00:41:38,124
Yeah, I'm totally feeling that.

769
00:41:38,134 --> 00:41:39,904
Okay.

770
00:41:43,664 --> 00:41:47,224
Grab your axes. Monsters in the Library.

771
00:41:47,234 --> 00:41:48,534
Are you baking for a fish?

772
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:50,494
He has a refined palate.

773
00:41:50,504 --> 00:41:52,404
Yeah, here, this should
fix the whole fish deal.

774
00:41:52,414 --> 00:41:55,233
And, yes, I noticed that your
eyeball isn't in your head,

775
00:41:55,234 --> 00:41:57,094
but honestly, we do not have
time for me to hear that story.

776
00:41:57,114 --> 00:41:59,454
- How long does the leaf take?
- I don't know.

777
00:41:59,464 --> 00:42:02,074
But you know it works?

778
00:42:04,164 --> 00:42:06,074
I can't believe I'm saying this,

779
00:42:06,084 --> 00:42:08,034
but I can't go until he's cured.

780
00:42:08,044 --> 00:42:10,384
If I leave, Josh will die.

781
00:42:10,394 --> 00:42:12,514
- It's okay.
- Penny.

782
00:42:12,524 --> 00:42:14,214
I'll bring Eliot back.

783
00:42:14,224 --> 00:42:15,904
I promise.

784
00:42:19,664 --> 00:42:22,604
Damn cheap bastards.

785
00:42:22,614 --> 00:42:24,084
No, no, please!

786
00:42:24,094 --> 00:42:26,744
No! No!

787
00:42:26,754 --> 00:42:28,694
Shit.

788
00:42:36,764 --> 00:42:39,674
What did you do
to get locked in this cage?

789
00:42:41,024 --> 00:42:43,104
Well, I...

790
00:42:43,114 --> 00:42:46,064
I went against every instinct I had.

791
00:42:46,074 --> 00:42:49,374
I tried to make a goddamn difference.

792
00:42:49,384 --> 00:42:52,114
Which, for the record,
you should never, ever do.

793
00:42:56,084 --> 00:42:58,294
Julia...

794
00:42:58,304 --> 00:43:00,604
if... if you're in there,

795
00:43:00,614 --> 00:43:03,304
then I'm sorry...

796
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:06,304
for everything that happened to you...

797
00:43:07,494 --> 00:43:08,614
Because of me.

798
00:43:08,624 --> 00:43:10,784
Hey, monster.

799
00:43:10,794 --> 00:43:13,054
Lady.

800
00:43:26,234 --> 00:43:27,414
Adorable.
