1
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:09,053
Previously on "The Magicians."

2
00:00:09,063 --> 00:00:11,428
Alice is fine. Depressed.

3
00:00:11,435 --> 00:00:12,460
Surly.

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,047
Still asking to see you again.

5
00:00:14,057 --> 00:00:15,788
She's fixated on the thing

6
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:17,411
she says she saw in the Castle.

7
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,620
She's worried about her friends.

8
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,847
I can't think of anyone
better protected than they.

9
00:00:23,159 --> 00:00:26,503
They must stay where they are
as they are.

10
00:00:26,513 --> 00:00:27,950
They'll be fine.

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,529
Your spellwork was was masterful.

12
00:00:37,973 --> 00:00:39,416
There's something you need to know

13
00:00:39,426 --> 00:00:41,342
and as soon as I start
telling you about this,

14
00:00:41,352 --> 00:00:43,435
bad shit is gonna start
flying at our heads.

15
00:00:46,242 --> 00:00:48,559
So how do we figure out
who we really are?

16
00:00:48,569 --> 00:00:50,355
Hi. I'm Marina.

17
00:00:50,365 --> 00:00:51,714
I'm here to help.

18
00:00:52,176 --> 00:00:55,474
So you're like some powerful, benevolent

19
00:00:55,484 --> 00:00:57,519
White Witch?

20
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,826
Let's take a peek underneath

21
00:00:59,837 --> 00:01:01,481
and see what you really look like.

22
00:01:04,928 --> 00:01:06,197
Fix it.

23
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:09,008
I don't know what you want me to fix!

24
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:10,967
Whatever the matter is in Fillory!

25
00:01:10,977 --> 00:01:13,143
Hello?

26
00:01:13,153 --> 00:01:15,058
Hello?!

27
00:01:26,993 --> 00:01:28,594
Old.

28
00:01:28,604 --> 00:01:31,814
Things get old so fast, don't they?

29
00:01:31,824 --> 00:01:33,642
Sorry, but where are we?

30
00:01:33,652 --> 00:01:35,557
I told you, Greece.

31
00:01:35,567 --> 00:01:37,167
Right, right.

32
00:01:37,177 --> 00:01:40,214
This is the temple of the god
we are summoning.

33
00:01:40,224 --> 00:01:41,737
Enyalius.

34
00:01:41,747 --> 00:01:43,183
God of war.

35
00:01:44,184 --> 00:01:45,872
Thought that was Ares.

36
00:01:48,188 --> 00:01:50,180
Say that when you see him.

37
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:52,062
It makes him so mad.

38
00:01:53,019 --> 00:01:55,185
So okay. Go in the woods.

39
00:01:55,195 --> 00:01:56,839
Get a pig.

40
00:01:56,849 --> 00:01:57,840
Excuse me?

41
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,841
A wild pig.

42
00:01:58,851 --> 00:02:00,364
The younger the better.

43
00:02:00,374 --> 00:02:01,670
Sorry, I don't mean to be difficult,

44
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,987
but couldn't you just conjure one?

45
00:02:05,162 --> 00:02:06,936
Hmm, no.

46
00:02:06,946 --> 00:02:09,112
It has to be caught with human hands

47
00:02:09,122 --> 00:02:11,898
and stained with human effort.

48
00:02:11,908 --> 00:02:13,290
You know, that, that stuff

49
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,954
that comes out of your skin.

50
00:02:16,216 --> 00:02:17,686
Sweat?

51
00:02:17,696 --> 00:02:18,871
Hurry.

52
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:23,866
What the fuck did you do?

53
00:02:23,876 --> 00:02:25,172
I didn't do anything.

54
00:02:25,182 --> 00:02:27,130
That spell's a cunt with fangs.

55
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,742
I thought your amulet
was supposed to protect us.

56
00:02:29,752 --> 00:02:32,396
It did. You're alive
and welcome, asshole.

57
00:02:32,406 --> 00:02:36,052
Well, great, that didn't work
and we're back to square one.

58
00:02:41,981 --> 00:02:43,712
- Yeah?
- Hello,

59
00:02:43,722 --> 00:02:45,192
whoever you are.

60
00:02:45,202 --> 00:02:48,238
Do not tamper with my enchantment.

61
00:02:48,248 --> 00:02:50,066
Holy shit, it's James Earl Jones!

62
00:02:50,076 --> 00:02:52,939
Shut. Up.

63
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:56,725
Yes, you've triggered
a read-me file voicemail.

64
00:02:56,735 --> 00:03:00,816
And no, you may not take me
off speaker phone.

65
00:03:00,826 --> 00:03:03,776
You will not circumvent
or defeat this spell.

66
00:03:03,786 --> 00:03:07,170
Whoever you are, walk away. Now.

67
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,923
Or your death is as certain
as those I've enchanted.

68
00:03:13,143 --> 00:03:16,136
So spells are basically credit cards

69
00:03:16,146 --> 00:03:18,921
with automated fraud warning calls?

70
00:03:18,931 --> 00:03:21,707
That's not super inspired.

71
00:03:21,717 --> 00:03:24,144
Well, neither is Henry Fogg.

72
00:03:24,154 --> 00:03:26,852
You are his favorite students, right?

73
00:03:27,766 --> 00:03:29,453
Sit in the kitchen

74
00:03:29,463 --> 00:03:31,107
until I tell you it's safe.

75
00:03:31,117 --> 00:03:32,902
You stay.

76
00:03:38,124 --> 00:03:39,855
She scares me.

77
00:03:39,865 --> 00:03:41,727
Yeah, well, she's not
the one with the Glock.

78
00:03:41,737 --> 00:03:44,261
I've got a theory about you, stud.

79
00:03:45,305 --> 00:03:47,264
Stand close.

80
00:03:59,972 --> 00:04:02,312
Oh, Henry. Such a good try.

81
00:04:02,322 --> 00:04:04,750
What are you doing?

82
00:04:06,892 --> 00:04:09,406
I'm making you useful.

83
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,017
Wait.

84
00:04:11,027 --> 00:04:12,332
Where's Janet?

85
00:04:14,465 --> 00:04:15,891
Hello?

86
00:04:15,901 --> 00:04:17,197
Anyone?

87
00:04:17,207 --> 00:04:19,808
Mother Nature, can you hear me?

88
00:04:19,818 --> 00:04:22,245
Wow, forests don't even talk.

89
00:04:22,255 --> 00:04:25,781
Whole psychotic break
just lacks imagination.

90
00:04:34,703 --> 00:04:35,747
Again.

91
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,222
- Jesus.
- Dude.

92
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:41,264
The chips.

93
00:04:41,274 --> 00:04:44,833
How am I doing this?

94
00:04:52,764 --> 00:04:54,070
Yes.

95
00:04:55,201 --> 00:04:57,856
This pond better be vodka.

96
00:05:21,327 --> 00:05:24,341
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -

97
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:32,108
Your Majesty?

98
00:05:33,544 --> 00:05:37,069
Jesus fuck.

99
00:05:41,552 --> 00:05:43,936
Forgive the suddenness
of my introduction.

100
00:05:43,946 --> 00:05:48,070
I know you're not
quite yourself, King Margo.

101
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,898
What are you?

102
00:05:49,908 --> 00:05:51,160
Where am I?

103
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:53,206
And why does everybody in this nightmare

104
00:05:53,216 --> 00:05:54,511
keep calling me king?

105
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,513
Is that even a thing?

106
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,212
I'll endeavor to explain.

107
00:06:10,886 --> 00:06:12,268
Hello.

108
00:06:12,278 --> 00:06:14,444
You're being kind of quiet.

109
00:06:17,457 --> 00:06:19,580
Look, you're nice and all.

110
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,235
Sort of. But I could use
some Intel on this place

111
00:06:22,245 --> 00:06:24,367
but how do I know you're not a snitch?

112
00:06:24,377 --> 00:06:25,934
Well, because

113
00:06:25,944 --> 00:06:28,023
like it or not, I'm Santa.

114
00:06:28,033 --> 00:06:31,244
Which used to mean I was once
considered fairly honest.

115
00:06:31,254 --> 00:06:33,986
Reasonably reliable,
but I, I don't know.

116
00:06:33,996 --> 00:06:35,509
Maybe...

117
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,424
slightly admired.

118
00:06:37,434 --> 00:06:39,513
Then all of the sudden
everyone's like, "Hey."

119
00:06:39,523 --> 00:06:42,472
You break into houses once
a year. What's up with that?"

120
00:06:42,482 --> 00:06:45,171
And, uh, "Kids sit on your lap.

121
00:06:45,181 --> 00:06:47,139
How is that not creepy?"

122
00:06:47,966 --> 00:06:49,392
Congratulations, Earth.

123
00:06:49,402 --> 00:06:52,178
You ruined the name of Santa.

124
00:06:52,188 --> 00:06:55,485
So you don't want to hear from me?

125
00:06:55,495 --> 00:06:57,487
Good.

126
00:06:57,497 --> 00:06:58,967
'Cause I'm sure you don't need

127
00:06:58,977 --> 00:07:00,534
this thing I could get you.

128
00:07:00,544 --> 00:07:02,328
Called magic.

129
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,375
How?

130
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:11,110
I am the Lord of All
Fillorian Fresh Water.

131
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,373
Which is a bit pretentious,

132
00:07:13,383 --> 00:07:16,593
so, please, call me Lord Fresh.

133
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,248
Assuming this is actually happening,

134
00:07:19,258 --> 00:07:20,946
you pulled me down here.

135
00:07:20,956 --> 00:07:22,121
Why?

136
00:07:22,131 --> 00:07:23,949
Your birthright box.

137
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:25,385
You and my birth box

138
00:07:25,395 --> 00:07:26,516
ain't happening

139
00:07:26,526 --> 00:07:28,431
so back up, "Shape of Water."

140
00:07:28,441 --> 00:07:33,001
No, no. Your birthright box.

141
00:07:33,011 --> 00:07:34,215
There.

142
00:07:35,278 --> 00:07:36,328
Right.

143
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:38,659
No, Majesty!

144
00:07:38,669 --> 00:07:41,662
If you touch it, it will harm you.

145
00:07:41,672 --> 00:07:44,534
Even my protective wards
couldn't save you.

146
00:07:44,544 --> 00:07:46,928
You know about that spell shit?

147
00:07:46,938 --> 00:07:48,234
I'm really somebody else,

148
00:07:48,244 --> 00:07:50,627
and if I try to figure out who
shit clobbers me, burns me?

149
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,064
Correct.

150
00:07:52,074 --> 00:07:54,718
Though, as I said,
you're safe down here.

151
00:07:54,728 --> 00:07:56,546
Your birthright box,

152
00:07:56,556 --> 00:07:59,071
which it has been my honor to guard,

153
00:07:59,081 --> 00:08:02,030
dictated your absence from the kingdom,

154
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,077
your loss of self, and your return

155
00:08:05,087 --> 00:08:07,035
this day and hour.

156
00:08:07,045 --> 00:08:09,124
But I must caution.

157
00:08:09,134 --> 00:08:11,257
It also predicted

158
00:08:11,267 --> 00:08:13,302
that you would learn what it is

159
00:08:13,312 --> 00:08:16,175
to live and rule alone.

160
00:08:16,185 --> 00:08:20,657
Yeah? Well, alone's my jam, grenouille.

161
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,269
And no matter what, I rule.

162
00:08:29,024 --> 00:08:32,234
Your enchantment is most powerful.

163
00:08:32,244 --> 00:08:34,584
I'm not sure that my wards will hold.

164
00:08:34,594 --> 00:08:37,065
To come back and claim your destiny,

165
00:08:37,075 --> 00:08:40,329
you must find the god
who summoned you in the dream.

166
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:43,724
Please accept my apologies.

167
00:08:43,734 --> 00:08:47,293
I'm afraid I can't keep you
as safe as I had hoped.

168
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,304
Walk toward the mountains.

169
00:08:58,314 --> 00:09:00,784
My destiny is to die
of pneumonia, isn't it?

170
00:09:00,794 --> 00:09:02,047
You can tell me.

171
00:09:02,057 --> 00:09:03,657
Hardly, Majesty.

172
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:06,399
Please return when the spell is lifted.

173
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:08,140
Here's your lunch.

174
00:09:19,988 --> 00:09:22,110
Well, if he did anything like my Henry,

175
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,253
he keeps most of his secrets...

176
00:09:25,515 --> 00:09:26,690
in here.

177
00:09:34,002 --> 00:09:36,298
Todd.

178
00:09:36,308 --> 00:09:37,647
Oh, my God.

179
00:09:37,657 --> 00:09:39,432
Hansel?

180
00:09:39,442 --> 00:09:41,618
- Hey.
- We gotta hustle.

181
00:09:42,793 --> 00:09:44,132
Yeah...

182
00:09:44,142 --> 00:09:45,481
anything I can do?

183
00:09:45,491 --> 00:09:47,135
Yeah. Take your shirt off

184
00:09:47,145 --> 00:09:48,712
and make me a sandwich.

185
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,144
Sorry, but I'm starved.

186
00:09:56,154 --> 00:09:58,451
If it helps, I'm vegan,
so this sucks for me too.

187
00:10:05,076 --> 00:10:07,731
Todd? Jesus, are you drunk?

188
00:10:16,218 --> 00:10:18,123
Marina.

189
00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:20,168
Hello, Henry.

190
00:10:20,178 --> 00:10:21,691
What is this? What did you do?

191
00:10:21,701 --> 00:10:23,737
It's the same blue shit you gave Hansel.

192
00:10:23,747 --> 00:10:26,479
Only I knew you wouldn't
drink it at my request.

193
00:10:26,489 --> 00:10:28,481
So here's the deal.

194
00:10:28,491 --> 00:10:31,035
- Give yourself the antidote.
- There is no antidote.

195
00:10:31,046 --> 00:10:32,093
Bullshit.

196
00:10:32,103 --> 00:10:33,616
Whoa, hoo, hoo, hoo!

197
00:10:33,626 --> 00:10:35,715
So it's true!

198
00:10:36,547 --> 00:10:39,060
Everything she's been
telling us is true!

199
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:40,236
Us?

200
00:10:40,503 --> 00:10:41,941
Who else is involved in this?

201
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,452
Pretty much all of your apple-shining,

202
00:10:44,463 --> 00:10:45,802
ass-kissing teacher's pets.

203
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:46,859
Christ.

204
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,283
Whatever she's saying she's

205
00:10:48,293 --> 00:10:50,503
going to do to help you, she isn't.

206
00:10:50,513 --> 00:10:52,244
And how are you talking
about this without...

207
00:10:52,254 --> 00:10:54,072
Being attacked by the world?

208
00:10:54,082 --> 00:10:55,421
It's magic, remember?

209
00:10:55,431 --> 00:10:56,857
What timeline are you from?

210
00:10:56,867 --> 00:10:58,738
The one where you owe me child support.

211
00:11:00,436 --> 00:11:03,255
I'm kidding. So the spell takes what,

212
00:11:03,265 --> 00:11:05,300
a day to kick in?

213
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,910
It's almost dawn.

214
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,869
You say there's no antidote.

215
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:10,827
You better get to a lab and get to it.

216
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:14,266
Because I'm not turning you into a DJ.

217
00:11:14,276 --> 00:11:16,311
No.

218
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:18,236
You won't like the new you.

219
00:11:19,585 --> 00:11:22,361
Unless you have a secret dream
to live in a moving box.

220
00:11:24,634 --> 00:11:27,637
You just hit the rethink button, okay?

221
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:32,239
Let's go.

222
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,328
Bye.

223
00:11:34,687 --> 00:11:36,341
Jesus.

224
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,170
Todd.

225
00:11:40,305 --> 00:11:42,120
How long have you been awake?

226
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,730
We need to get you some help.

227
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,776
No. And what you just saw dies with you.

228
00:11:46,786 --> 00:11:48,092
Do you understand?

229
00:12:00,357 --> 00:12:01,973
This cannot continue.

230
00:12:02,823 --> 00:12:06,730
An infinity of pardons,
Acting High King Fen.

231
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,955
There is an urgent matter.

232
00:12:13,296 --> 00:12:14,592
An urgent poacher?

233
00:12:14,603 --> 00:12:16,213
Who claims to be the High King.

234
00:12:16,224 --> 00:12:17,563
So an urgent, insane poacher.

235
00:12:17,573 --> 00:12:19,087
- Was my first thought.
- Until?

236
00:12:19,097 --> 00:12:21,534
The name... was uttered.

237
00:12:36,244 --> 00:12:38,236
So.

238
00:12:38,246 --> 00:12:41,239
You claim to be High King...

239
00:12:41,249 --> 00:12:43,295
- Margo?
- No!

240
00:12:48,866 --> 00:12:50,901
- There you have it.
- So every time you say...

241
00:12:52,391 --> 00:12:54,165
Weird, huh?

242
00:12:54,175 --> 00:12:56,559
You look nothing like... her.

243
00:12:56,569 --> 00:12:58,143
Look.

244
00:12:58,154 --> 00:13:01,912
I'm not saying I'm
who we are not talking about.

245
00:13:01,922 --> 00:13:04,872
But I had this dream where
this goat god, Amber?

246
00:13:04,882 --> 00:13:06,264
Ember.

247
00:13:06,274 --> 00:13:07,875
Whatevs.

248
00:13:07,885 --> 00:13:09,615
Said I had to get here quick and dirty.

249
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,443
The reports are true.

250
00:13:11,453 --> 00:13:13,228
Ember has indeed returned to Fillory.

251
00:13:13,238 --> 00:13:14,795
Miraculously risen from the dead.

252
00:13:14,805 --> 00:13:17,188
Look. If you know where this Ember is...

253
00:13:17,198 --> 00:13:18,799
We don't, is the problem.

254
00:13:18,809 --> 00:13:22,715
We don't want to find him. We have to.

255
00:13:22,725 --> 00:13:24,858
Something's happened since his return.

256
00:13:26,729 --> 00:13:29,461
Oh, I'm nodding so you hurry

257
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,900
and you get to something
I actually understand.

258
00:13:34,694 --> 00:13:36,468
Our air

259
00:13:36,478 --> 00:13:40,168
has always been graced
with what you on Earth call

260
00:13:40,178 --> 00:13:41,647
opium.

261
00:13:41,657 --> 00:13:43,201
But now it's saturated.

262
00:13:43,212 --> 00:13:45,608
For some it's tolerable.

263
00:13:45,618 --> 00:13:47,436
Some get quite giddy,

264
00:13:47,446 --> 00:13:50,265
a few succumb to sleep
at the most inconvenient times,

265
00:13:50,275 --> 00:13:52,441
and then there are those who...

266
00:13:52,451 --> 00:13:53,572
Dance.

267
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,596
In the nude.

268
00:13:54,607 --> 00:13:56,619
It sounds lighthearted,

269
00:13:56,629 --> 00:13:59,317
but it's actually resulted
in a number of deaths,

270
00:13:59,327 --> 00:14:01,711
mainly in falling asleep
in the wrong place

271
00:14:01,721 --> 00:14:02,973
at the wrong time.

272
00:14:02,983 --> 00:14:05,621
Trampled in the middle of the
road being the most common.

273
00:14:05,632 --> 00:14:08,805
Uh, however, a dancer
did die of exposure

274
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:10,633
on a glacier, though, uh,

275
00:14:10,643 --> 00:14:13,201
by all accounts, quite gracefully.

276
00:14:13,211 --> 00:14:14,802
Magic is now rationed.

277
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:16,944
And none of it is powerful
enough to reverse this.

278
00:14:16,954 --> 00:14:19,511
And since it coincides
with Ember's return...

279
00:14:19,521 --> 00:14:21,992
His glorious resurrection
and divine rule!

280
00:14:22,002 --> 00:14:24,560
We hope.

281
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,954
We've come to believe
that this is his doing.

282
00:14:26,964 --> 00:14:29,478
And perhaps if he could be told

283
00:14:29,488 --> 00:14:30,783
of the damage it's causing,

284
00:14:30,793 --> 00:14:33,264
he could be convinced to reverse this.

285
00:14:33,274 --> 00:14:34,526
Guys.

286
00:14:34,536 --> 00:14:36,267
I need to stress

287
00:14:36,277 --> 00:14:38,487
how much I don't give a shit.

288
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:41,446
But he's dodging you

289
00:14:41,456 --> 00:14:43,535
and he wants me.

290
00:14:43,545 --> 00:14:45,504
So let's find the fucker.

291
00:14:48,811 --> 00:14:50,248
Sassy.

292
00:14:52,293 --> 00:14:53,328
- Hi.
- Hi!

293
00:14:53,338 --> 00:14:54,372
Kim, sorry, I'm late.

294
00:14:54,382 --> 00:14:55,460
No, this won't take long.

295
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,897
I think I'm flunking out.

296
00:14:56,907 --> 00:14:58,681
Oh, first year nerves, totally normal.

297
00:14:58,691 --> 00:14:59,987
No, no, no, I am literally
failing everything.

298
00:14:59,997 --> 00:15:01,684
I mean, if I could just pass one...

299
00:15:01,694 --> 00:15:02,728
And somebody told you
I have a cheating spell.

300
00:15:02,738 --> 00:15:04,252
Yes.

301
00:15:04,262 --> 00:15:05,253
Okay, I will hook you up right now.

302
00:15:05,263 --> 00:15:06,602
I'm trying not to freak.

303
00:15:06,612 --> 00:15:07,733
- What's wrong?
- I can't tell you.

304
00:15:07,743 --> 00:15:08,996
- Okay.
- I promised.

305
00:15:09,006 --> 00:15:10,736
- Right.
- Dean Fogg is leaving. Shit!

306
00:15:10,746 --> 00:15:11,737
Why did I just say that?

307
00:15:11,747 --> 00:15:13,391
Because it's too much.

308
00:15:13,401 --> 00:15:14,740
Why do I have to be
the only one who knows?

309
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,873
Wait, he's leaving? Why?

310
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:18,701
Oh, believe me, it is not his choice.

311
00:15:18,711 --> 00:15:20,572
See, there's this
Hedge Witch, and she...

312
00:15:20,582 --> 00:15:23,271
Dean Fogg, hi! Sorry I'm late.

313
00:15:23,281 --> 00:15:25,012
I will give you every
cheating spell I have

314
00:15:25,022 --> 00:15:26,448
if you please don't repeat this, okay?

315
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,015
Great. Thanks. It's gonna be fine.

316
00:15:28,025 --> 00:15:29,842
Oh, my God, this is horrible.

317
00:15:29,852 --> 00:15:31,540
So even after you're gone,

318
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,411
nothing about Marina
can go in the memoir?

319
00:15:33,421 --> 00:15:34,760
Write or breathe a single word

320
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,545
and there will be blood on your hands.

321
00:15:36,555 --> 00:15:39,026
But the outstanding business
I'm attending to today

322
00:15:39,036 --> 00:15:41,637
should be recorded in minute detail.

323
00:15:41,647 --> 00:15:42,768
Walter.

324
00:15:42,778 --> 00:15:44,422
Walter.

325
00:15:44,432 --> 00:15:47,295
You're the best drinking
companion I've ever had.

326
00:15:47,305 --> 00:15:48,687
Thanks.

327
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,428
I mean, we only drank together twice.

328
00:15:50,438 --> 00:15:52,561
I'm a high-functioning
alcoholic, Walter.

329
00:15:52,571 --> 00:15:54,911
We prefer to do
our serious drinking alone.

330
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:56,105
So that when we weep,

331
00:15:56,116 --> 00:15:58,351
we can wallow in
self-loathing without embarrassment.

332
00:15:58,362 --> 00:15:59,527
Did you get that, Todd?

333
00:15:59,538 --> 00:16:01,352
- Fantastic.
- Excellent.

334
00:16:01,362 --> 00:16:03,572
Walter, in my office bar

335
00:16:03,582 --> 00:16:07,619
is an unopened bottle
of 1977 Hollcroft single malt

336
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:10,927
that I was going to drink
if I ever committed suicide.

337
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:13,582
Enjoy, my dear friend.

338
00:16:13,592 --> 00:16:15,497
It's not your fault
I'm always broke, Ashley.

339
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:17,412
I'm a degenerate gambler
who can use magic

340
00:16:17,422 --> 00:16:18,804
to alter the outcome of any game.

341
00:16:18,814 --> 00:16:20,589
But then I couldn't relive
the secret shame

342
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:22,112
I've held since I was two years old.

343
00:16:22,122 --> 00:16:23,679
What I crave most in the world

344
00:16:23,689 --> 00:16:25,986
is the degradation of losing.

345
00:16:25,996 --> 00:16:27,988
Thank you for every single
moment of that.

346
00:16:27,998 --> 00:16:29,424
You're $56 short.

347
00:16:29,434 --> 00:16:31,992
You're a cutthroat bookie.

348
00:16:32,002 --> 00:16:33,645
Gold.

349
00:16:33,655 --> 00:16:35,865
Magic has been a brutal
series of disappointments.

350
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,736
And after having lived 40 timelines,

351
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:40,478
39 of which range
from the comically horrendous

352
00:16:40,488 --> 00:16:41,914
to the apocalyptically absurd,

353
00:16:41,924 --> 00:16:45,527
to find it was all for nothing, well...

354
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:49,748
leaving this life
actually feels liberating.

355
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:52,403
- Hold this, Todd. Thank you.
- Okay.

356
00:16:55,025 --> 00:16:58,028
Tell Jennifer thank you and goodbye.

357
00:16:59,812 --> 00:17:01,499
I had an affair with his wife.

358
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:03,545
He behaved abominably.

359
00:17:03,555 --> 00:17:05,895
Do you find all this
as cathartic as I do, Todd?

360
00:17:05,905 --> 00:17:07,636
I think you really hurt him.

361
00:17:07,646 --> 00:17:09,029
Well, back to my childhood.

362
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,769
I was raised by my grandmother,

363
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,641
the kindest, wisest person
I've ever known.

364
00:17:12,651 --> 00:17:14,274
Of course I could never tell her that

365
00:17:14,285 --> 00:17:16,809
because all forms
of intimacy horrify me.

366
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:21,693
"All forms of intimacy
terrify the hell out of me."

367
00:17:22,878 --> 00:17:24,793
Yes?

368
00:17:28,971 --> 00:17:31,921
Kim. What can I do for you?

369
00:17:31,931 --> 00:17:34,576
Look, I'm pretty sure
I shouldn't tell you this.

370
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:37,535
Well, you probably shouldn't
have walked in and said that.

371
00:17:37,545 --> 00:17:40,147
I don't think that I belong here.

372
00:17:40,157 --> 00:17:42,888
As I said, it would take some time.

373
00:17:42,898 --> 00:17:46,109
And, I promise, you do.

374
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:48,198
Right, and you're literally the only one

375
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,384
that thinks that, and you're leaving.

376
00:17:51,646 --> 00:17:52,734
Todd.

377
00:17:55,988 --> 00:17:57,424
Look, it's not his fault.

378
00:17:57,435 --> 00:18:00,543
He's just upset. I am too.
Anybody that knew would be.

379
00:18:01,221 --> 00:18:02,570
Please.

380
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:12,094
I probably owe you an explanation.

381
00:18:12,105 --> 00:18:14,445
My life is mostly made up of regrets.

382
00:18:14,455 --> 00:18:16,883
I'm not looking
for contradiction or pity.

383
00:18:16,893 --> 00:18:19,929
It's just a fact
I'm suddenly forced to face.

384
00:18:19,939 --> 00:18:21,931
But of all my many regrets

385
00:18:21,941 --> 00:18:24,151
the greatest is something
I did very recently

386
00:18:24,161 --> 00:18:26,327
to some of the most maddeningly
millennial students

387
00:18:26,337 --> 00:18:27,686
I ever had.

388
00:18:34,345 --> 00:18:35,858
What...

389
00:18:35,868 --> 00:18:37,294
Were they gonna hit us?

390
00:18:37,304 --> 00:18:40,820
Advantage of being the spell caster.

391
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,866
I'll never be able to correct
what I did to them.

392
00:18:43,876 --> 00:18:45,215
But Kim,

393
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:46,260
one day you might.

394
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,321
Me?

395
00:18:47,332 --> 00:18:49,219
You have no idea

396
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:51,028
what you're capable of.

397
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,345
I do.

398
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:55,307
Okay, then if you want me
to help these students

399
00:18:55,318 --> 00:18:57,102
can you tell me who they are?

400
00:18:58,594 --> 00:19:01,536
Their lives were in grave danger.

401
00:19:01,546 --> 00:19:04,017
I cast a spell that erased
their identities

402
00:19:04,027 --> 00:19:05,453
and gave them new ones,

403
00:19:05,463 --> 00:19:08,935
and now that same spell
has been cast on me.

404
00:19:08,945 --> 00:19:10,947
Jesus.

405
00:19:11,991 --> 00:19:13,765
I mean, isn't there anything you can do?

406
00:19:13,775 --> 00:19:16,333
Well, if I reveal that
the spell can be reversed,

407
00:19:16,343 --> 00:19:19,336
then someone would reverse
the spell on my students,

408
00:19:19,346 --> 00:19:21,305
ensuring their deaths.

409
00:19:22,045 --> 00:19:24,167
I will not allow that to happen.

410
00:19:24,177 --> 00:19:25,952
I have to do this.

411
00:19:25,962 --> 00:19:28,094
I must accept this.

412
00:19:54,251 --> 00:19:56,427
Ah, stubborn dude.

413
00:19:57,741 --> 00:19:59,513
You got Plan B?

414
00:19:59,524 --> 00:20:01,335
B plans are for losers.

415
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,952
Okay. Uh, well, whatever
happens, thank you for trying.

416
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,995
I don't really know why

417
00:20:09,005 --> 00:20:12,645
you're putting yourself out
so much for us, but...

418
00:20:12,656 --> 00:20:14,387
it's pretty cool.

419
00:20:14,397 --> 00:20:16,302
Well, it's pretty common knowledge

420
00:20:16,312 --> 00:20:20,089
that I'm a very, very good
person who lives to help others.

421
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:30,708
It's such a piece of shit.

422
00:20:30,718 --> 00:20:33,102
Hey. I like the artwork.

423
00:20:33,112 --> 00:20:34,930
Yep. Sure.

424
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,976
You have to admit, the characters? Us?

425
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,325
We're pretty complex.

426
00:20:39,335 --> 00:20:41,806
Oh, yeah, real complex.

427
00:20:41,816 --> 00:20:45,027
Yeah, Isaac's big problem
is his dick is too big.

428
00:20:45,037 --> 00:20:47,377
Hey. It can be a problem.

429
00:20:47,387 --> 00:20:48,682
Seriously.

430
00:20:48,692 --> 00:20:51,681
It narrows the field
by a lot more than you think.

431
00:20:51,692 --> 00:20:53,296
I've been on way too many first dates

432
00:20:53,306 --> 00:20:55,124
that end in urgent care, so...

433
00:20:55,134 --> 00:20:56,429
- Gross.
- Look.

434
00:20:56,439 --> 00:21:00,956
My life is pretty cool, so...

435
00:21:00,966 --> 00:21:04,002
how do I know this other me is gonna...

436
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:05,351
Nail as many groupies?

437
00:21:05,361 --> 00:21:07,638
Whoa, hey, whoa, no.

438
00:21:07,649 --> 00:21:11,923
That is not what Hansel is about, okay?

439
00:21:11,933 --> 00:21:14,099
You know there's a chance the real you

440
00:21:14,109 --> 00:21:15,927
didn't bang your sister?

441
00:21:15,937 --> 00:21:17,320
Hey, no, that's...

442
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:19,697
she was my step sister, okay?

443
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,065
Step sister.

444
00:21:21,076 --> 00:21:23,021
And we didn't know till, till later.

445
00:21:24,337 --> 00:21:25,692
Too many stepdads.

446
00:21:25,703 --> 00:21:27,373
All right, well, what about you?

447
00:21:27,383 --> 00:21:28,745
What's your kink?

448
00:21:28,756 --> 00:21:30,420
Me?

449
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,069
No, see, I'm perfect.

450
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,380
Yeah, I catch drug dealers, murderers,

451
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:36,295
arsonists, blackmailers, pimps.

452
00:21:36,305 --> 00:21:38,167
I even stopped a girl
from giving herself

453
00:21:38,177 --> 00:21:41,649
a coat-hanger abortion and got her
to Planned Parenthood. You see, I...

454
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,998
I'm a hero.

455
00:21:43,008 --> 00:21:44,260
So why would you give that up?

456
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,783
You sound awesome.

457
00:21:45,793 --> 00:21:48,786
I sound fake.

458
00:21:48,796 --> 00:21:51,223
Which I am.

459
00:21:51,233 --> 00:21:54,139
- Oh, like your thunder meat.
- All right, easy.

460
00:21:54,149 --> 00:21:56,794
It's... it's a meat.

461
00:21:56,804 --> 00:21:59,328
I don't know if it's thunder.

462
00:22:00,852 --> 00:22:02,844
We just never know where his celestial,

463
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:05,368
newly-risen godliness
is going to pop up next.

464
00:22:05,378 --> 00:22:07,413
From the brothel in the Lower Meerskin,

465
00:22:07,423 --> 00:22:09,111
Ember was then sighted on the schooner

466
00:22:09,121 --> 00:22:11,548
of the thin white duke
off Basher Island,

467
00:22:11,558 --> 00:22:13,985
where there was a celebration
for three days and nights.

468
00:22:13,995 --> 00:22:15,024
Okay.

469
00:22:15,035 --> 00:22:17,859
Well, so far, every sighting he
either gets the party started

470
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:20,617
or he dives right into one
that's already jumping off.

471
00:22:20,628 --> 00:22:22,298
Ember has always enjoyed his pleasures,

472
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:25,257
but this pace reeks of self-destruction.

473
00:22:25,267 --> 00:22:26,345
Please.

474
00:22:26,355 --> 00:22:27,912
One July 4th,

475
00:22:27,922 --> 00:22:30,393
I bet I could snort
my bodyweight in coke.

476
00:22:30,403 --> 00:22:31,960
This dude's an amateur.

477
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,232
Next.

478
00:22:34,276 --> 00:22:36,529
Landfall at Shimmering Cliff Palace,

479
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:39,445
then an... orgy

480
00:22:39,455 --> 00:22:41,491
at Sacred Sky Nunnery.

481
00:22:41,501 --> 00:22:44,199
Okay. That's almost impressive.

482
00:22:45,244 --> 00:22:47,801
So look, he's headed east.

483
00:22:47,811 --> 00:22:51,022
If he keeps going,
what's the next hotspot?

484
00:22:51,032 --> 00:22:52,241
The Hare on the Ass.

485
00:22:52,251 --> 00:22:53,905
Seriously?

486
00:22:57,996 --> 00:22:59,161
Whimsy.

487
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:01,260
I fucking hate it.

488
00:23:02,217 --> 00:23:04,906
So you found a whole
family of them, huh?

489
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,921
What happened to the mother pig?

490
00:23:13,533 --> 00:23:15,211
Kill it.

491
00:23:15,222 --> 00:23:16,265
What?

492
00:23:16,275 --> 00:23:19,964
Enyalius won't come without
a sacrifice, silly.

493
00:23:19,974 --> 00:23:21,183
Here.

494
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:23,272
Slit its belly open, please.

495
00:23:23,282 --> 00:23:25,100
Entrails on the altar.

496
00:23:26,459 --> 00:23:29,365
No, I'm not, I'm not...

497
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:31,410
Look, I'm a person with a job

498
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,108
and a girlfriend and a life,

499
00:23:33,118 --> 00:23:36,850
and I'm not your, your pal.
Or your playmate.

500
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,773
And I'm not scared of you anymore.

501
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:42,465
So why don't you just fucking kill me?

502
00:23:42,475 --> 00:23:44,303
I would never do that.

503
00:23:57,925 --> 00:23:59,961
Hello, Etta.

504
00:24:03,061 --> 00:24:05,367
Oh, I suppose this is why
you summoned me.

505
00:24:08,544 --> 00:24:10,145
Thank you.

506
00:24:10,155 --> 00:24:12,016
Oh, and the answer is no.

507
00:24:12,026 --> 00:24:13,887
Your new suit is not finished yet.

508
00:24:13,897 --> 00:24:15,672
Oh, pity.

509
00:24:15,682 --> 00:24:18,240
You are usually not this impatient.

510
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:21,504
Henry, would you like to see
the work in progress?

511
00:24:21,514 --> 00:24:22,560
Oh, yes.

512
00:24:22,571 --> 00:24:24,181
Okay.

513
00:24:30,044 --> 00:24:31,296
Beautiful.

514
00:24:31,306 --> 00:24:33,395
Of course.

515
00:24:35,528 --> 00:24:37,607
- Damn it.
- What in the world?

516
00:24:37,617 --> 00:24:39,261
Magic ration.

517
00:24:39,271 --> 00:24:42,090
My office had some
unexpected visitors today

518
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,179
who took a huge portion
of today's magic.

519
00:24:44,189 --> 00:24:46,887
Ah. No worries.

520
00:24:48,889 --> 00:24:50,325
Smell.

521
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:59,977
I'm sorry.

522
00:24:59,987 --> 00:25:03,024
That's my grandmother's huckleberry pie.

523
00:25:03,034 --> 00:25:04,677
Wait, what?

524
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:06,385
What is it, Henry?

525
00:25:10,432 --> 00:25:12,598
So why a comic book?

526
00:25:12,608 --> 00:25:15,079
Graphic novel, Etta.

527
00:25:15,089 --> 00:25:19,083
Had a lot of characters
with detailed backstories.

528
00:25:19,093 --> 00:25:20,345
And I could look at them.

529
00:25:20,355 --> 00:25:23,566
So the glamour was much easier to cast.

530
00:25:23,576 --> 00:25:25,698
Doesn't matter now.

531
00:25:25,708 --> 00:25:28,092
I'm about to live a version of it.

532
00:25:28,102 --> 00:25:31,008
Though, I'm assured,
one not quite as nice.

533
00:25:31,018 --> 00:25:34,229
Well, you seem awfully sanguine.

534
00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:37,101
Fate's a fucker that always wins.

535
00:25:37,111 --> 00:25:39,408
Okay, I've known you for 22...

536
00:25:39,418 --> 00:25:43,151
well... 23 years now.

537
00:25:43,161 --> 00:25:46,328
And I've loved you dearly every moment.

538
00:25:46,338 --> 00:25:49,766
Fully aware that you can barely
stand yourself.

539
00:25:49,776 --> 00:25:53,074
And that made me sad, but...

540
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:56,164
it also made you my best customer.

541
00:25:56,174 --> 00:25:57,610
How so?

542
00:25:58,654 --> 00:26:00,733
Isn't it obvious?

543
00:26:00,743 --> 00:26:02,605
Come on, the bespoke suits,

544
00:26:02,615 --> 00:26:05,042
the hand-sewn shirts...

545
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,655
It's armor.

546
00:26:09,665 --> 00:26:12,702
It's an armor to keep the world away.

547
00:26:12,712 --> 00:26:15,183
A disguise so that nobody

548
00:26:15,193 --> 00:26:18,152
can see what a truly
loving heart you have.

549
00:26:30,512 --> 00:26:33,157
You said if revealed
the spell can be reversed.

550
00:26:33,167 --> 00:26:34,199
Kim.

551
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,507
Don't.

552
00:26:39,565 --> 00:26:41,436
I'm one of them, aren't I?

553
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:47,128
You have to undo this on all of us.

554
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:48,216
And then what?

555
00:26:48,226 --> 00:26:49,478
And then we fight.

556
00:26:49,488 --> 00:26:51,262
I know I can't stop you.

557
00:26:51,272 --> 00:26:54,787
But please, be more careful now

558
00:26:54,797 --> 00:26:57,225
than you've ever been in your life.

559
00:26:57,235 --> 00:26:59,367
Well, lives.

560
00:27:07,593 --> 00:27:10,107
Finally getting to be your teacher...

561
00:27:14,034 --> 00:27:16,069
Has been an honor.

562
00:27:46,327 --> 00:27:49,451
You're now the saddest loser
I ever buried.

563
00:27:49,461 --> 00:27:50,679
Look.

564
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:02,648
Marina.

565
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:05,390
Hi, Dad.

566
00:28:24,499 --> 00:28:25,761
How's it going?

567
00:28:29,826 --> 00:28:31,654
Got it.

568
00:28:36,587 --> 00:28:38,197
Do you feel it?

569
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:42,330
Stronger further up.

570
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,603
My arm wouldn't even fit in there.

571
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:55,788
Go, little buddy. Come on.

572
00:28:59,444 --> 00:29:01,141
Come on, little buddy.

573
00:29:25,644 --> 00:29:28,158
Hey. Hey, come on now. Little narration.

574
00:29:28,168 --> 00:29:29,899
Fuck off.

575
00:29:29,909 --> 00:29:31,693
Come on, little buddy.

576
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:01,898
Yes?

577
00:30:05,249 --> 00:30:06,695
I realize that.

578
00:30:06,706 --> 00:30:08,818
But these dossiers are private.

579
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:13,344
Holy shit.

580
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,524
Sorry, little buddy.

581
00:30:29,534 --> 00:30:30,830
What happened?

582
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,483
What?

583
00:30:32,493 --> 00:30:33,876
Did, did anyone ever tell you

584
00:30:33,886 --> 00:30:36,270
you're kind of withholding, you know?

585
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,621
Oh, come on. You're not trying
to kill yourself again, are you?

586
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:40,893
No.

587
00:30:44,244 --> 00:30:46,889
Hey, is all of that chimney
stuff about you true?

588
00:30:46,899 --> 00:30:49,293
Never met one I couldn't crack.

589
00:30:54,646 --> 00:30:57,552
- Leg next?
- No, no, no, no, no.

590
00:30:57,562 --> 00:31:00,294
Okay, I'm ready.
Whatever you want, okay?

591
00:31:08,921 --> 00:31:10,957
Time to die. Yes it is.

592
00:31:10,967 --> 00:31:12,915
Give me a little goodbye kiss.

593
00:31:12,925 --> 00:31:14,361
Yes.

594
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:21,793
Explains a lot of weird shit, but...

595
00:31:21,803 --> 00:31:25,754
I promised I'd keep everything
about him private.

596
00:31:25,764 --> 00:31:29,932
Okay. Yeah, and I'm trying to save him.

597
00:31:29,942 --> 00:31:31,596
So please.

598
00:31:34,773 --> 00:31:36,672
How was that? Was it good?

599
00:31:36,683 --> 00:31:38,071
- Yeah.
- Can I have one?

600
00:31:38,081 --> 00:31:40,725
Oh, yes. Of course.

601
00:31:40,735 --> 00:31:42,423
Thank you.

602
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,518
Magic's supposed to stay on till 11:00.

603
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:52,694
Spells take magic, right?

604
00:31:52,704 --> 00:31:55,044
- Which is rationed.
- Which sucks.

605
00:31:55,054 --> 00:31:57,699
And a spell like this would
take even more power

606
00:31:57,709 --> 00:31:59,092
than a normal one, right?

607
00:31:59,102 --> 00:32:02,312
I mean, six, seven, eight people?

608
00:32:02,322 --> 00:32:04,314
Plus whole lives?

609
00:32:04,324 --> 00:32:07,535
No. If you had any
interruption in the flow...

610
00:32:10,026 --> 00:32:12,105
Wait. Magic's off.

611
00:32:12,115 --> 00:32:13,239
It's him.

612
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,891
It's the spell. He told me
that it would try and kill us.

613
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:18,111
Right, but without magic, how...

614
00:32:18,121 --> 00:32:19,634
Shit.

615
00:32:19,644 --> 00:32:21,027
Maybe he actually finished it.

616
00:32:21,037 --> 00:32:22,593
Finished what?

617
00:32:22,603 --> 00:32:25,596
This thing he worked on for years.

618
00:32:25,606 --> 00:32:27,782
A perpetual battery.

619
00:32:30,002 --> 00:32:31,003
Come on.

620
00:32:34,659 --> 00:32:36,400
Pray a little harder, please.

621
00:32:42,058 --> 00:32:44,408
Is that suckling I smell?

622
00:32:45,322 --> 00:32:46,835
Enyalius?

623
00:32:46,845 --> 00:32:48,663
Well, fuck yeah it is.

624
00:32:48,673 --> 00:32:50,360
You know what's funny?

625
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:51,927
He sacrificed the pig.

626
00:32:51,937 --> 00:32:53,450
He prayed.

627
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:54,984
And he's never heard of you.

628
00:33:02,861 --> 00:33:04,723
How dare you?

629
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:14,602
I want it back.

630
00:33:14,612 --> 00:33:16,125
Give it to me.

631
00:33:16,135 --> 00:33:19,911
Well, I have no idea what "it" is

632
00:33:19,921 --> 00:33:24,046
but I grant you permission to search
my ball sack with your tongue.

633
00:33:24,056 --> 00:33:25,669
Fine.

634
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,366
I'll just take it.

635
00:34:08,492 --> 00:34:10,658
Okay, so.

636
00:34:10,668 --> 00:34:14,183
Remember, Fogg said be really,
really careful. Because...

637
00:34:17,501 --> 00:34:19,493
Oh, my God. Kim?

638
00:34:19,503 --> 00:34:20,547
Kim.

639
00:34:22,426 --> 00:34:23,678
No, no.

640
00:34:23,942 --> 00:34:25,857
No, no, no.

641
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,764
Yeah, I need a medic.

642
00:34:29,774 --> 00:34:32,603
Yeah, I think she's...

643
00:34:33,734 --> 00:34:35,718
Sorry, prank.

644
00:34:37,999 --> 00:34:40,480
Kim. Are you okay?

645
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,778
Fine.

646
00:34:43,788 --> 00:34:45,823
No, see.

647
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,825
You kind of...

648
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:48,923
died.

649
00:34:52,954 --> 00:34:55,960
Well, maybe being un-killable
is my discipline.

650
00:34:55,971 --> 00:34:58,858
Yeah, that's not a thing.

651
00:35:01,136 --> 00:35:03,171
Hey.

652
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:05,313
How much juice do you think
this thing has?

653
00:35:05,323 --> 00:35:07,794
Well, it's perpetual.

654
00:35:07,804 --> 00:35:09,796
So...

655
00:35:09,806 --> 00:35:14,279
- it can be overloaded.
- I have no idea.

656
00:35:15,464 --> 00:35:17,325
Oh, shit!

657
00:35:17,335 --> 00:35:19,206
How is this a good idea?

658
00:35:38,443 --> 00:35:39,478
Oh, God.

659
00:35:40,673 --> 00:35:42,501
It's not in there!

660
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:48,356
You're not Enyalius, are you?

661
00:35:48,366 --> 00:35:51,228
You're his servant.

662
00:35:51,238 --> 00:35:54,580
A corybant. Aren't you?

663
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:57,365
All right, look, he's,
he's not who you want.

664
00:35:57,375 --> 00:35:58,584
So just...

665
00:35:58,594 --> 00:36:00,281
You know, let him go.

666
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:02,501
All right?

667
00:36:04,251 --> 00:36:07,244
Why did your master
send you to trick me?

668
00:36:07,254 --> 00:36:09,256
He knows.

669
00:36:34,412 --> 00:36:35,882
It's not even mid-day.

670
00:36:35,892 --> 00:36:38,285
Real ragers rave in the day.

671
00:36:43,987 --> 00:36:46,598
Horn guy. Is that him?

672
00:36:55,651 --> 00:36:56,946
Who is that?

673
00:36:56,956 --> 00:36:58,426
An imposter.

674
00:36:58,436 --> 00:37:00,593
No wonder he won't see
anyone who knows him.

675
00:37:00,604 --> 00:37:01,997
Hey. Ember.

676
00:37:04,486 --> 00:37:06,434
I'm here.

677
00:37:06,444 --> 00:37:08,436
Yeah, you are.

678
00:37:08,446 --> 00:37:10,013
Congrats.

679
00:37:12,581 --> 00:37:14,887
Where are your hooves?

680
00:37:51,576 --> 00:37:52,621
Todd.

681
00:38:34,184 --> 00:38:36,611
Quentin. You're back.

682
00:38:46,588 --> 00:38:49,494
You wanted to play.

683
00:38:49,504 --> 00:38:51,636
Sorry. He's too dead.

684
00:38:56,253 --> 00:38:58,462
Cool trick. Do it again.

685
00:39:24,472 --> 00:39:27,280
Okay, what the what now?

686
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:30,250
What the fuck are you
doing here, Bacchus?

687
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:31,991
All right.

688
00:39:32,375 --> 00:39:33,845
Have we banged?

689
00:39:33,856 --> 00:39:35,717
I followed you on Instagram.

690
00:39:35,727 --> 00:39:37,719
Everybody did till they kicked you off.

691
00:39:37,729 --> 00:39:39,982
Oh, I know, right? Dicks.

692
00:39:39,992 --> 00:39:41,375
Well.

693
00:39:41,385 --> 00:39:44,900
That explains all the opium in the air.
Nice touch, I like it.

694
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:47,604
- It's pretty sweet, right?
- Mm-hmm, all right, all right.

695
00:39:47,615 --> 00:39:50,368
What are you doing here? Why do you
want everyone thinking you're Ember?

696
00:39:50,379 --> 00:39:53,605
Hey, so, you really want to
go back to Earth, right?

697
00:39:53,615 --> 00:39:55,781
No, I want you to answer
my fucking question.

698
00:39:55,791 --> 00:39:56,869
Thanks for popping in.

699
00:39:59,925 --> 00:40:01,178
Where is our High King?

700
00:40:01,188 --> 00:40:03,005
Who are you?

701
00:40:03,015 --> 00:40:04,398
A god

702
00:40:04,408 --> 00:40:07,107
is all you need to know.

703
00:40:13,809 --> 00:40:15,854
I'm glad you're back, Quentin.

704
00:40:17,073 --> 00:40:20,120
I was getting a little tired
of the Brian game.

705
00:40:21,643 --> 00:40:24,124
Yeah, me too.

706
00:40:29,129 --> 00:40:34,124
So maybe I missed something
when we were playing, but...

707
00:40:34,134 --> 00:40:38,268
you had to torture him to death.

708
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:42,262
Why, again?

709
00:40:42,272 --> 00:40:45,918
Gods are so tricky.

710
00:40:45,928 --> 00:40:47,441
Right.

711
00:40:47,451 --> 00:40:51,706
But what about the one
that you were after today?

712
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:54,231
Oh, we'll get him.

713
00:40:54,241 --> 00:40:56,798
And I'll get back what he took from me.

714
00:40:56,808 --> 00:40:58,365
And then the others.

715
00:40:58,375 --> 00:40:59,758
They all took.

716
00:40:59,768 --> 00:41:02,152
Took what, exactly?

717
00:41:02,162 --> 00:41:04,284
See, that's what I don't really know.

718
00:41:04,294 --> 00:41:07,679
They took this part of me

719
00:41:07,689 --> 00:41:10,170
that knew things.

720
00:41:11,301 --> 00:41:13,337
It's not fair.

721
00:41:13,347 --> 00:41:15,305
No, yeah, totally.

722
00:41:16,306 --> 00:41:18,003
They owe you.

723
00:41:19,744 --> 00:41:21,006
Got it.

724
00:41:22,921 --> 00:41:25,750
You really understand me, Quentin.

725
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:30,146
It's good to have a friend like you.

726
00:41:34,977 --> 00:41:36,708
You know, speaking of friends,

727
00:41:36,718 --> 00:41:39,014
when you get back

728
00:41:39,024 --> 00:41:41,157
what the gods took from you...

729
00:41:43,377 --> 00:41:45,847
maybe...

730
00:41:45,857 --> 00:41:48,947
could I maybe have Eliot back?

731
00:41:50,993 --> 00:41:52,985
The one who tried to kill me?

732
00:41:52,995 --> 00:41:55,770
Hey, hey, no. No. That was a mistake.

733
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,218
You were there. You...

734
00:42:00,045 --> 00:42:02,342
like him more than me?

735
00:42:02,352 --> 00:42:04,475
No, I, I didn't say that.

736
00:42:04,485 --> 00:42:06,825
You miss him.

737
00:42:06,835 --> 00:42:10,220
You... you miss all your friends.

738
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:13,484
The... the ones in my castle

739
00:42:13,494 --> 00:42:14,973
who tried to kill me.

740
00:42:20,501 --> 00:42:21,883
Good.

741
00:42:27,856 --> 00:42:31,066
Well, upsides and downsides.

742
00:42:31,076 --> 00:42:32,764
Yeah, no, I remember everything.

743
00:42:32,774 --> 00:42:34,853
Kind of like a dream.

744
00:42:34,863 --> 00:42:37,431
I was gonna say acid trip myself.

745
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,961
Oh, my God.

746
00:42:47,919 --> 00:42:49,433
Mis hermanos.

747
00:42:49,443 --> 00:42:51,870
Where were you? We looked everywhere.

748
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,490
- Stay back.
- Why?

749
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:00,170
Because I'm not here to play.
