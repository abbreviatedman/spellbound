1
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,000
- Previously on "The Magicians."

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,083
- Alice is fine.
- Depressed.

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:11,590
Surly.

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:13,324
Still asking to see you again.

5
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,297
- She's fixated on the thing

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,273
she says she saw in the Castle.

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,080
She's worried about her friends.

8
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,210
- I can't think of anyone
- better protected than they.

9
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:26,000
They must stay where
they are as they are.

10
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:27,050
- They'll be fine.

11
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:31,030
Your spellwork
was was masterful.

12
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,210
- There's something
you need to know

13
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,200
and as soon as I start
telling you about this,

14
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:43,090
bad shit is gonna start
flying at our heads.

15
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,140
- So how do we figure
out who we really are?

16
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,090
- Hi. I'm Marina.

17
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,200
I'm here to help.

18
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,000
- So you're like some
powerful, benevolent

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,060
White Witch?

20
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,100
- Uh-huh.

21
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:00,130
Let's take a peek
underneath and see what you

22
00:01:00,131 --> 00:01:01,060
really look like.

23
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,000
- Fix it.

24
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,150
- I don't know what
you want me to fix!

25
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,120
- Whatever the
matter is in Fillory!

26
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,200
- Hello?

27
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:14,150
Hello?!

28
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,030
- Old.

29
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:31,090
Things get old so
fast, don't they?

30
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,040
- Sorry, but where are we?

31
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,020
- I told you, Greece.

32
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,200
- Right, right.

33
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:39,210
- This is the temple of
the god we are summoning.

34
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,060
Enyalius.

35
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,210
God of war.

36
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,120
- Thought that was Ares.

37
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,210
Say that when you see him.

38
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:51,180
It makes him so mad.

39
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,200
So okay. Go in the woods.

40
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,100
Get a pig.

41
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,100
- Excuse me?

42
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,090
- A wild pig.

43
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,250
The younger the better.

44
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,060
- Sorry, I don't
mean to be difficult,

45
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,150
but couldn't you
just conjure one?

46
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,120
- Hmm, no.

47
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,180
It has to be caught
with human hands

48
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,120
and stained with human effort.

49
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,220
You know, that, that stuff

50
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,150
that comes out of your skin.

51
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,060
- Sweat?

52
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,120
- Hurry.

53
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,120
What the fuck did you do?

54
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,190
- I didn't do anything.

55
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:26,170
That spell's a cunt with fangs.

56
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,050
- I thought your amulet
was supposed to protect us.

57
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,270
- It did. You're alive
and welcome, asshole.

58
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,225
- Well, great, that didn't work

59
00:02:33,226 --> 00:02:35,170
and we're back to square one.

60
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,105
Yeah?

61
00:02:42,106 --> 00:02:44,190
- Hello, whoever you are.

62
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,210
Do not tamper with
my enchantment.

63
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:49,180
- Holy shit, it's
James Earl Jones!

64
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,130
- Shut. Up.

65
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:56,070
- Yes, you've triggered
a read-me file voicemail.

66
00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:00,090
And no, you may not take
me off speaker phone.

67
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,090
You will not circumvent
or defeat this spell.

68
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:04,640
Whoever you are, walk away.

69
00:03:04,641 --> 00:03:06,190
Now.

70
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:08,170
Or your death is as certain

71
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:10,130
as those I've enchanted.

72
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:15,180
- So spells are
basically credit cards

73
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,120
with automated
fraud warning calls?

74
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:21,060
That's not super inspired.

75
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,190
- Well, neither is Henry Fogg.

76
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,120
You are his favorite
students, right?

77
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,280
Sit in the kitchen

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,180
until I tell you it's safe.

79
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,130
You stay.

80
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,110
- She scares me.

81
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,060
- Yeah, well, she's not
the one with the Glock.

82
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,240
- I've got a theory
about you, stud.

83
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,220
- Stand close.

84
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,180
- Ooh.

85
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,200
- Oh, Henry.

86
00:04:00,201 --> 00:04:01,250
Such a good try.

87
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:04,080
What are you doing?

88
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,110
Ow.

89
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,270
I'm making you useful.

90
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,150
- Wait.

91
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,250
Where's Janet?

92
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,120
- Hello?

93
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,200
Anyone?

94
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,100
Mother Nature, can you hear me?

95
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,220
Wow, forests don't even talk.

96
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:25,100
Whole psychotic break
just lacks imagination.

97
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,100
- Again.

98
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,235
- Jesus.

99
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,230
- Dude.

100
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,230
The chips.

101
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,110
- How am I doing this?

102
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,180
- Yes.

103
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,120
This pond better be vodka.

104
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,180
- Your Majesty?

105
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,180
- Jesus fuck.

106
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,130
- Forgive the suddenness
of my introduction.

107
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:47,180
I know you're not quite
yourself, King Margo.

108
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,120
- What are you?

109
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,120
Where am I?

110
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,200
And why does everybody
in this nightmare

111
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,000
keep calling me king?

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Is that even a thing?

113
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,200
- I'll endeavor to explain.

114
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,240
- Hello.

115
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,270
You're being kind of quiet.

116
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,010
Look, you're nice and all.

117
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,180
Sort of. But I could use
some intel on this place

118
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,250
but how do I know
you're not a snitch?

119
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:27,160
- Well, because like
it or not, I'm Santa.

120
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,675
Which used to mean I was once

121
00:06:28,676 --> 00:06:30,180
considered fairly honest.

122
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:33,120
Reasonably reliable,
but I, I don't know.

123
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,260
Maybe, uh... slightly admired.

124
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,290
Then all of the sudden
everyone's like, "Hey."

125
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,145
You break into houses once

126
00:06:40,146 --> 00:06:41,300
"a year. What's up with that?"

127
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,200
And, uh, "Kids sit on your lap."

128
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,200
How is that not creepy?"

129
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,260
Congratulations, Earth.

130
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:51,200
You ruined the name of Santa.

131
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:55,000
So you don't want
to hear from me?

132
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Good.

133
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,133
'Cause I'm sure you don't need

134
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,000
this thing I could get you.

135
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,250
Called magic.

136
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,180
- How?

137
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,180
- I am the Lord of All
Fillorian Fresh Water.

138
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,250
Which is a bit pretentious,

139
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:16,020
so, please, call me Lord Fresh.

140
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,230
- Assuming this is
actually happening,

141
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,130
you pulled me down here.

142
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,180
Why?

143
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,130
- Your birthright box.

144
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,230
- You and my birth
box ain't happening

145
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,270
so back up, "Shape of Water."

146
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,720
- No, no.

147
00:07:29,721 --> 00:07:32,150
Your birthright box.

148
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,230
There.

149
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,230
- Oh.

150
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,200
Right.

151
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,040
- No, Majesty!

152
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,040
If you touch it,
it will harm you.

153
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:44,000
Even my protective
wards couldn't save you.

154
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:46,120
- You know about
that spell shit?

155
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,220
I'm really somebody else,

156
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:49,010
and if I try to figure out who

157
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,043
shit clobbers me, burns me?

158
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:51,180
- Correct.

159
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,060
Though, as I said,
you're safe down here.

160
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:57,100
Your birthright box,
which it has been

161
00:07:57,101 --> 00:08:01,170
my honor to guard,
dictated your absence

162
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,680
from the kingdom,
your loss of self,

163
00:08:02,681 --> 00:08:06,170
and your return
this day and hour.

164
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,170
But I must caution.

165
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:12,240
It also predicted that
you would learn what it is

166
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,190
to live and rule alone.

167
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:20,040
- Yeah? Well, alone's
my jam, grenouille.

168
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:22,230
And no matter what, I rule.

169
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:31,230
- Your enchantment
is most powerful.

170
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,020
I'm not sure that
my wards will hold.

171
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,160
To come back and
claim your destiny,

172
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,710
you must find the god

173
00:08:37,711 --> 00:08:39,250
who summoned you in the dream.

174
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,040
Please accept my apologies.

175
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:46,240
I'm afraid I can't keep
you as safe as I had hoped.

176
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,250
Walk toward the mountains.

177
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:00,090
- My destiny is to die
of pneumonia, isn't it?

178
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,160
You can tell me.

179
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,040
- Hardly, Majesty.

180
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:05,260
Please return when
the spell is lifted.

181
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,200
Here's your lunch.

182
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,200
- Ugh!

183
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,190
- Well, if he did
anything like my Henry,

184
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,240
he keeps most of his secrets...

185
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,050
in here.

186
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,250
Todd.

187
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:37,040
- Oh, my God.

188
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,270
Hansel?

189
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,660
- Hey.

190
00:09:39,661 --> 00:09:41,040
- We gotta hustle.

191
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,000
- Yeah, uh... anything I can do?

192
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,070
- Yeah. Take your shirt
off and make me a sandwich.

193
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,200
- Sorry, but I'm starved.

194
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,250
If it helps, I'm vegan,
so this sucks for me too.

195
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:07,080
- Todd? Jesus, are you drunk?

196
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,170
Marina.

197
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:19,210
- Hello, Henry.

198
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,135
- What is this?

199
00:10:20,136 --> 00:10:21,050
What did you do?

200
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,070
- It's the same blue
shit you gave Hansel.

201
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,270
Only I knew you wouldn't
drink it at my request.

202
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,280
So here's the deal.

203
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,003
Give yourself the antidote.

204
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,170
- There is no antidote.

205
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,170
- Bullshit.

206
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:33,010
- Whoa, hoo, hoo, hoo!

207
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,070
So it's true!

208
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:38,250
Everything she's been
telling us is true!

209
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,000
- Us?

210
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,190
Who else is involved in this?

211
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,260
- Pretty much all of
your apple-shining,

212
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,080
ass-kissing teacher's pets.

213
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,010
- Christ.

214
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,220
Whatever she's saying she's

215
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,000
going to do to help
you, she isn't.

216
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,203
And how are you talking
about this without...

217
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,170
- Being attacked by the world?

218
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,270
It's magic, remember?

219
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,010
- What timeline are you from?

220
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,080
- The one where you
owe me child support.

221
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,280
I'm kidding.

222
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,240
So the spell takes
what, a day to kick in?

223
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,110
It's almost dawn.

224
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,100
You say there's no antidote.

225
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:10,080
You better get to a
lab and get to it.

226
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:13,240
Because I'm not
turning you into a DJ.

227
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,250
No.

228
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,240
You won't like the new you.

229
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:21,261
- Unless you have a secret dream
- to live in a moving box.

230
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,040
- You just hit the
rethink button, okay?

231
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,230
Let's go.

232
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,250
- Bye.

233
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,260
- Jesus.

234
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,220
- Todd.

235
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,190
How long have you been awake?

236
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,070
- We need to get you some help.

237
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,090
- No. And what you
just saw dies with you.

238
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,200
Do you understand?

239
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,200
- This cannot continue.

240
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,280
- An infinity of pardons,

241
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,210
Acting High King Fen.

242
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,200
There is an urgent matter.

243
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,090
- An urgent poacher?

244
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,243
- Who claims to
be the High King.

245
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,040
- So an urgent, insane poacher.

246
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,213
- Was my first thought.
- Until?

247
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,030
- The name... was uttered.

248
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:37,250
- So.

249
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:41,240
You claim to be High King...
Margo?

250
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,260
- No!

251
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,120
- Ow!

252
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,140
- There you have it.

253
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,150
- So every time you say...

254
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,230
- Weird, huh?

255
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,030
- You look nothing like... her.

256
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,250
- Look.

257
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:01,150
I'm not saying I'm who
we are not talking about.

258
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,130
But I had this dream where
this goat god, Amber?

259
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,250
Ember.

260
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,120
- Whatevs.

261
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,050
Said I had to get
here quick and dirty.

262
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,000
- The reports are true.

263
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,243
Ember has indeed
returned to Fillory.

264
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,110
- Miraculously
risen from the dead.

265
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,230
- Look. If you know
where this Ember is...

266
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,110
- We don't, is the problem.

267
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,085
We don't want to find him.

268
00:13:20,086 --> 00:13:22,050
We have to.

269
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,150
Something's happened
since his return.

270
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:29,010
- Oh, I'm nodding so you hurry

271
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:32,140
and you get to something
I actually understand.

272
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,080
- Oh.

273
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:37,260
Our air has always been graced

274
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:41,040
with what you on
Earth call opium.

275
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,010
But now it's saturated.

276
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,040
For some it's tolerable.

277
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:47,000
Some get quite giddy,
a few succumb to sleep

278
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,250
at the most inconvenient times,

279
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,280
and then there are those who...

280
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,040
- Dance.

281
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:54,080
In the nude.

282
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,050
- It sounds lighthearted,

283
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,270
but it's actually resulted
in a number of deaths,

284
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,090
mainly in falling asleep
in the wrong place

285
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,090
at the wrong time.

286
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,113
- Trampled in the
middle of the road

287
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,100
being the most common.

288
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:08,110
Uh, however, a dancer
did die of exposure

289
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,155
on a glacier, though,
uh, by all accounts,

290
00:14:11,156 --> 00:14:12,240
quite gracefully.

291
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,240
- Magic is now rationed.

292
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,140
And none of it is powerful
enough to reverse this.

293
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:19,020
And since it coincides
with Ember's return...

294
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:21,170
- His glorious resurrection
and divine rule!

295
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:24,020
- We hope.

296
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,140
We've come to believe
that this is his doing.

297
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:29,000
And perhaps if he could be told

298
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,185
of the damage it's causing,
he could be convinced

299
00:14:31,186 --> 00:14:32,250
to reverse this.

300
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,030
- Guys.

301
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:38,010
I need to stress how
much I don't give a shit.

302
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,120
- Oh.

303
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:43,030
- But he's dodging
you and he wants me.

304
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,030
So let's find the fucker.

305
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,250
- Sassy.

306
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:51,760
- Hi.

307
00:14:51,761 --> 00:14:52,261
- Hi!

308
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,280
Kim, sorry, I'm late.

309
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,003
- No, this won't take long.

310
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,130
I think I'm flunking out.

311
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,030
- Oh, first year
nerves, totally normal.

312
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,153
- No, no, no, I am literally
failing everything.

313
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,070
I mean, if I could
just pass one...

314
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,083
- And somebody told you
I have a cheating spell.

315
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,250
- Yes.

316
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,253
- Okay, I will hook
you up right now.

317
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,050
I'm trying not to freak.

318
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,013
- What's wrong?
- I can't tell you.

319
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:07,595
- Okay.

320
00:15:07,596 --> 00:15:08,170
- I promised.

321
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:10,080
- Right.
- Dean Fogg is leaving. Shit!

322
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:11,100
Why did I just say that?

323
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,000
Because it's too much.

324
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,103
Why do I have to be
the only one who knows?

325
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,115
- Wait, he's leaving?

326
00:15:15,116 --> 00:15:16,120
Why?

327
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,070
- Oh, believe me, it
is not his choice.

328
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,040
See, there's this
Hedge Witch, and she...

329
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,150
Dean Fogg, hi!

330
00:15:21,151 --> 00:15:22,250
Sorry I'm late.

331
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,160
I will give you every
cheating spell I have

332
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:26,000
if you please don't
repeat this, okay?

333
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,163
- Great. Thanks.
- It's gonna be fine.

334
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:29,120
Oh, my God, this is horrible.

335
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,015
So even after you're
gone, nothing about Marina

336
00:15:32,016 --> 00:15:33,000
can go in the memoir?

337
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,103
- Write or breathe a single word

338
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,030
and there will be
blood on your hands.

339
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,170
But the outstanding business
I'm attending to today

340
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:41,070
should be recorded
in minute detail.

341
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,020
Walter.

342
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,000
Walter.

343
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,260
You're the best drinking
companion I've ever had.

344
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,080
- Thanks.

345
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,000
I mean, we only
drank together twice.

346
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:52,030
- I'm a high-functioning
alcoholic, Walter.

347
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,130
We prefer to do our
serious drinking alone.

348
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,570
So that when we weep,

349
00:15:55,571 --> 00:15:57,000
we can wallow in self-loathing

350
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,000
without embarrassment.

351
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,050
Did you get that, Todd?

352
00:15:59,070 --> 00:15:59,670
- Fantastic.

353
00:15:59,671 --> 00:16:00,270
- Excellent.

354
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:05,040
Walter, in my office bar
is an unopened bottle

355
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:07,050
of 1977 Hollcroft single malt

356
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,605
that I was going to drink

357
00:16:08,606 --> 00:16:10,140
if I ever committed suicide.

358
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:13,040
Enjoy, my dear friend.

359
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:15,020
It's not your fault I'm
always broke, Ashley.

360
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm a degenerate gambler
who can use magic

361
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,120
to alter the
outcome of any game.

362
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,040
But then I couldn't
relive the secret shame

363
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,120
I've held since I
was two years old.

364
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,080
What I crave most in the world

365
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:25,160
is the degradation of losing.

366
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,140
Thank you for every
single moment of that.

367
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:29,000
- You're $56 short.

368
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,160
- You're a cutthroat bookie.

369
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,070
- Gold.

370
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,120
Magic has been a brutal
series of disappointments.

371
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:37,090
And after having
lived 40 timelines,

372
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,010
39 of which range from
the comically horrendous

373
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:45,030
to the apocalyptically
absurd, to find it was all

374
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,070
for nothing, well...
leaving this life

375
00:16:47,071 --> 00:16:49,100
actually feels liberating.

376
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,555
Hold this, Todd. Thank you.

377
00:16:50,556 --> 00:16:52,000
- Okay.

378
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:57,190
- Tell Jennifer thank
you and goodbye.

379
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,020
I had an affair with his wife.

380
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,000
He behaved abominably.

381
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,140
Do you find all this as
cathartic as I do, Todd?

382
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,050
- I think you really hurt him.

383
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,073
- Well, back to my childhood.

384
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,090
I was raised by my grandmother,

385
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,050
the kindest, wisest
person I've ever known.

386
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,183
Of course I could
never tell her that

387
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:16,060
because all forms of
intimacy horrify me.

388
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:21,080
"All forms of intimacy
terrify the hell out of me."

389
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,080
Yes?

390
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:31,150
Kim. What can I do for you?

391
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,040
- Look, I'm pretty sure I
shouldn't tell you this.

392
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,540
- Well, you probably shouldn't

393
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,030
have walked in and said that.

394
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,220
- I don't think
that I belong here.

395
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,140
- As I said, it
would take some time.

396
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:45,200
And, I promise, you do.

397
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,240
- Right, and you're
literally the only one

398
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,000
that thinks that,
and you're leaving.

399
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,100
- Todd.

400
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,220
- Look, it's not his fault.

401
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,003
- He's just upset.
- I am too.

402
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,190
Anybody that knew would be.

403
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,280
- Please.

404
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,140
I probably owe you
an explanation.

405
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,240
My life is mostly
made up of regrets.

406
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,070
I'm not looking for
contradiction or pity.

407
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,080
It's just a fact I'm
suddenly forced to face.

408
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:21,070
But of all my many regrets

409
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,160
the greatest is something
I did very recently

410
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,210
to some of the most
maddeningly millennial students

411
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,020
I ever had.

412
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,200
- What... Were they gonna hit us?

413
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:40,040
- Advantage of being
the spell caster.

414
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:43,050
I'll never be able to
correct what I did to them.

415
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,190
But Kim, one day you might.

416
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,190
- Me?

417
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,130
- You have no idea
what you're capable of.

418
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,230
I do.

419
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,160
- Okay, then if you want
me to help these students

420
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,110
can you tell me who they are?

421
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,260
- Their lives were
in grave danger.

422
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,110
I cast a spell that
erased their identities

423
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:06,165
and gave them new ones,
and now that same spell

424
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:08,080
has been cast on me.

425
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:10,100
- Jesus.

426
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,030
I mean, isn't there
anything you can do?

427
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,210
- Well, if I reveal that
the spell can be reversed,

428
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,715
then someone would reverse

429
00:19:16,716 --> 00:19:20,210
the spell on my students,
ensuring their deaths.

430
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:23,140
I will not allow that to happen.

431
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:25,060
I have to do this.

432
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:27,150
I must accept this.

433
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:55,250
- Ah, stubborn dude.

434
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,040
You got Plan B?

435
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:00,210
- B plans are for losers.

436
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,210
- Okay.

437
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:04,110
Uh, well, whatever happens,
thank you for trying.

438
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:10,080
I don't really know why
you're putting yourself out

439
00:20:10,081 --> 00:20:13,270
so much for us, but...
it's pretty cool.

440
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,250
- Well, it's pretty
common knowledge

441
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,240
that I'm a very,
very good person

442
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,190
who lives to help others.

443
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,210
- Mm.

444
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,130
Oh.

445
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:30,060
- It's such a piece of shit.

446
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:32,190
- Hey. I like the artwork.

447
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,140
- Yep. Sure.

448
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,170
- You have to admit,
the characters? Us?

449
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,260
We're pretty complex.

450
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,090
- Oh, yeah, real complex.

451
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,180
Yeah, Isaac's big problem
is his dick is too big.

452
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,270
- Hey. It can be a problem.

453
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,060
Seriously.

454
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,150
It narrows the field by a
lot more than you think.

455
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,250
I've been on way
too many first dates

456
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,745
that end in urgent care, so...
- Gross.

457
00:20:54,746 --> 00:20:55,280
- Look.

458
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,150
My life is pretty cool, so...

459
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,170
how do I know this
other me is gonna...

460
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,260
- Nail as many groupies?

461
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:07,090
- Whoa, hey, whoa, no.

462
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:11,150
That is not what
Hansel is about, okay?

463
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,180
- You know there's a
chance the real you

464
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,130
didn't bang your sister?

465
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,250
- Hey, no, that's...

466
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:20,230
She was my step sister, okay?
Step sister.

467
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,180
And we didn't know
till, till later.

468
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:25,100
- Mm.
- Too many stepdads.

469
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:28,150
All right, well, what about you?
What's your kink?

470
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,280
- Me?

471
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,200
No, see, I'm perfect.

472
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,270
Yeah, I catch drug
dealers, murderers,

473
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,250
arsonists, blackmailers, pimps.

474
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,200
I even stopped a girl
from giving herself

475
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,203
a coat-hanger abortion and
got her to Planned Parenthood.

476
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:42,160
You see, I... I'm a hero.

477
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,250
- So why would you give that up?

478
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,090
You sound awesome.

479
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:48,090
- I sound fake.

480
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,240
Which I am.

481
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,250
- Oh, like your thunder meat.

482
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,190
- All right, easy.

483
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,090
It's... it's a meat.

484
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,270
I don't know if it's thunder.

485
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,100
- We just never know
where his celestial,

486
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:04,240
newly-risen godliness
is going to pop up next.

487
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,280
From the brothel in
the Lower Meerskin,

488
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,203
Ember was then sighted
on the schooner

489
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:11,010
of the thin white duke
off Basher Island,

490
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,163
- where there was a celebration
- for three days and nights.

491
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,160
- Okay.

492
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:16,010
Well, so far, every
sighting he either gets

493
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:18,140
the party started or
he dives right into one

494
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,090
that's already jumping off.

495
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,253
- Ember has always
enjoyed his pleasures,

496
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:24,250
but this pace reeks
of self-destruction.

497
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,250
- Please.

498
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,205
One July 4th,
I bet I could snort

499
00:22:28,206 --> 00:22:29,270
my bodyweight in coke.

500
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,160
This dude's an amateur.

501
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:32,250
Next.

502
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,010
- Landfall at
Shimmering Cliff Palace,

503
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:41,000
then an... orgy at
Sacred Sky Nunnery.

504
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:43,240
- Okay. That's
almost impressive.

505
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,090
So look, he's headed east.

506
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,180
If he keeps going,
what's the next hotspot?

507
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:53,150
- The Hare on the Ass.
- Seriously?

508
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,220
Whimsy.

509
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,250
I fucking hate it.

510
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,130
So you found a whole
family of them, huh?

511
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,280
Mm.

512
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,150
What happened to the mother pig?

513
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,240
Kill it.

514
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,240
- What?

515
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:19,140
- Enyalius won't come
without a sacrifice, silly.

516
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,220
Here.

517
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,240
Slit its belly open, please.

518
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,200
Entrails on the altar.

519
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,270
- No, I'm not, I'm not...

520
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,280
Look, I'm a person with a job

521
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,200
and a girlfriend and a life,

522
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,155
and I'm not your, your pal.

523
00:23:34,156 --> 00:23:36,100
Or your playmate.

524
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,150
And I'm not scared
of you anymore.

525
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:42,000
So why don't you
just fucking kill me?

526
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,260
- I would never do that.

527
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,010
- Ah!

528
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,150
Hello, Etta.

529
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,280
- Oh, I suppose this
is why you summoned me.

530
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:11,160
- Thank you.
- Oh, and the answer is no.

531
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:15,040
Your new suit is not finished yet.
- Oh, pity.

532
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,240
- You are usually
not this impatient.

533
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:21,000
Henry, would you like to
see the work in progress?

534
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,000
- Oh, yes.

535
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:23,220
- Okay.

536
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,150
- Ah.

537
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:33,000
Beautiful.
Of course.

538
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,030
Damn it.

539
00:24:36,031 --> 00:24:37,040
- What in the world?

540
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,250
- Magic ration.

541
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:41,170
My office had some
unexpected visitors today

542
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,190
who took a huge portion
of today's magic.

543
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,650
- Ah.

544
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:46,100
No worries.

545
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:49,270
Smell.

546
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:59,150
I'm sorry.

547
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,160
That's my grandmother's
huckleberry pie.

548
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,060
- Wait, what?

549
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:06,000
What is it, Henry?

550
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,030
So why a comic book?

551
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,180
- Graphic novel, Etta.

552
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:18,180
Had a lot of characters
with detailed backstories.

553
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,260
And I could look at them.

554
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:23,020
So the glamour was
much easier to cast.

555
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:25,060
Doesn't matter now.

556
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:27,180
I'm about to live
a version of it.

557
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:30,160
Though, I'm assured,
one not quite as nice.

558
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:33,230
- Well, you seem
awfully sanguine.

559
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,180
- Fate's a fucker
that always wins.

560
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:38,280
- Okay, I've known you for 22...

561
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,210
Well... 23 years now.

562
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:45,250
And I've loved you
dearly every moment.

563
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:49,080
Fully aware that you can
barely stand yourself.

564
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:53,700
And that made me sad, but...
it also made you

565
00:25:53,701 --> 00:25:55,210
my best customer.

566
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,050
- How so?

567
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,070
- Isn't it obvious?

568
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,170
Come on, the bespoke suits,
the hand-sewn shirts...

569
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,050
It's armor.

570
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:12,060
It's an armor to
keep the world away.

571
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,735
A disguise so that nobody
can see what a truly

572
00:26:15,736 --> 00:26:17,230
loving heart you have.

573
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,200
- You said if revealed
the spell can be reversed.

574
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,200
- Kim.

575
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:35,010
Don't.

576
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,000
- I'm one of them, aren't I?

577
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,200
You have to undo
this on all of us.

578
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:47,240
- And then what?

579
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,000
- And then we fight.

580
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,250
- I know I can't stop you.

581
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:54,090
But please, be more careful now

582
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:58,680
than you've ever been in your life.
Well, lives.

583
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,190
Finally getting to
be your teacher...

584
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:15,180
Has been an honor.

585
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:49,000
- You're now the saddest
loser I ever buried.

586
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,080
Look.

587
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,050
- Marina.

588
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,280
- Hi, Dad.

589
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,030
- How's it going?

590
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:31,010
- Got it.

591
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,240
- Do you feel it?

592
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,250
- Stronger further up.

593
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:44,040
- My arm wouldn't
even fit in there.

594
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,180
- Go, little buddy.

595
00:28:54,181 --> 00:28:55,110
Come on.

596
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,220
Come on, little buddy.

597
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,210
- Hey. Hey, come on now.

598
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,210
Little narration.

599
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,140
- Fuck off.

600
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:31,060
Come on, little buddy.

601
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:01,150
- Yes?

602
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,110
I realize that.

603
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:08,130
But these dossiers are private.

604
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,260
- Holy shit.

605
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:29,010
Sorry, little buddy.

606
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,100
- What happened?

607
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:32,000
What?

608
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:35,240
Did, did anyone ever tell you you're kind of
withholding, you know?

609
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:39,040
Oh, come on. You're not trying to kill
yourself again, are you?

610
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:40,160
No.

611
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:46,130
Hey, is all of that chimney
stuff about you true?

612
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,260
- Never met one
I couldn't crack.

613
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,535
- Leg next?

614
00:30:55,536 --> 00:30:57,020
- No, no, no, no, no.

615
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,140
Okay, I'm ready.

616
00:30:58,141 --> 00:30:59,250
Whatever you want, okay?

617
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,250
Ah.

618
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,160
Oh.

619
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,145
- Time to die.

620
00:31:09,146 --> 00:31:10,150
Yes it is.

621
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,140
Give me a little goodbye kiss.

622
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,280
Yes.

623
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:21,080
- Explains a lot of
weird shit, but...

624
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:25,080
I promised I'd keep
everything about him private.

625
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:29,140
- Okay. Yeah, and I'm
trying to save him.

626
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:31,040
So please.

627
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:35,085
How was that?

628
00:31:35,086 --> 00:31:36,080
Was it good?

629
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,190
- Yeah.
- Can I have one?

630
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,635
- Oh, yes.

631
00:31:38,636 --> 00:31:40,070
Of course.

632
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,280
- Thank you.

633
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:50,010
- Magic's supposed to
stay on till 11:00.

634
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,060
Spells take magic, right?

635
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,190
Which is rationed.
- Which sucks.

636
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,200
And a spell like this would take even more power
than a normal one, right?

637
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:01,250
I mean, six, seven,
eight people?

638
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,250
Plus whole lives?

639
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:07,010
- No. If you had any
interruption in the flow...

640
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,200
Wait. Magic's off.

641
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,200
- It's him.

642
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:14,030
It's the spell.

643
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,123
He told me that it
would try and kill us.

644
00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:19,050
- Right, but without magic, how...
Shit.

645
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,173
Maybe he actually finished it.

646
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,040
- Finished what?

647
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:25,010
- This thing he
worked on for years.

648
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,100
A perpetual battery.

649
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:30,080
- Come on.

650
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,000
- Pray a little harder, please.

651
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:44,000
- Is that suckling I smell?

652
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:46,100
- Enyalius?

653
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:48,050
- Well, fuck yeah it is.

654
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:51,140
- You know what's funny?
- He sacrificed the pig.

655
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:54,170
He prayed.
- And he's never heard of you.

656
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:04,130
How dare you?

657
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:14,030
- I want it back.

658
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,210
Give it to me.

659
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:19,130
- Well, I have no
idea what "it" is

660
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,280
but I grant you permission

661
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,170
to search my ball
sack with your tongue.

662
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:26,010
- Fine.

663
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,200
I'll just take it.

664
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:10,010
- Okay, so.

665
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:12,150
Remember, Fogg said be
really, really careful.

666
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:13,230
Because...

667
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:18,010
- Oh, my God.

668
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:19,010
Kim?

669
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:20,030
Kim.

670
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,130
No, no.

671
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,130
No, no, no.

672
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,090
Yeah, I need a medic.

673
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:30,110
Yeah, I think she's...

674
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:36,010
- Sorry, prank.

675
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:40,030
Kim. Are you okay?

676
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:43,090
- Fine.

677
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:45,090
- No, see.

678
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:48,150
You kind of... died.

679
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,170
- Well, maybe being
un-killable is my discipline.

680
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:58,130
- Yeah, that's not a thing.

681
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:03,010
- Hey.

682
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:05,050
How much juice do you
think this thing has?

683
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:07,210
- Well, it's perpetual.

684
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:11,150
- So... it can be overloaded.

685
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:14,050
- I have no idea.

686
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:17,050
Oh, shit!

687
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:19,030
How is this a good idea?

688
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:39,110
- Oh, God.

689
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:42,090
- It's not in there!

690
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:51,030
You're not Enyalius, are you?
You're his servant.

691
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,600
A corybant.

692
00:35:52,601 --> 00:35:54,150
Aren't you?

693
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:57,070
- All right, look, he's,
he's not who you want.

694
00:35:57,070 --> 00:36:00,050
So just... You know, let him go.

695
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:02,110
All right?

696
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:07,030
- Why did your master
send you to trick me?

697
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:09,050
- He knows.

698
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:35,210
- It's not even mid-day.

699
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:38,030
- Real ragers rave in the day.

700
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,705
Horn guy.

701
00:36:44,706 --> 00:36:46,150
Is that him?

702
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:56,250
- Who is that?

703
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,090
- An imposter.

704
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,130
No wonder he won't see
anyone who knows him.

705
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,260
- Hey. Ember.

706
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:06,090
I'm here.

707
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:08,090
- Yeah, you are.

708
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:09,250
Congrats.

709
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:14,230
- Where are your hooves?

710
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,170
Todd.

711
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:36,150
- Quentin. You're back.

712
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:46,130
Oh.

713
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:49,110
You wanted to play.

714
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:51,170
Sorry. He's too dead.

715
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:58,170
- Cool trick. Do it again.

716
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:26,250
- Okay, what the what now?

717
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:30,090
- What the fuck are you
doing here, Bacchus?

718
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:32,030
- All right.

719
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:33,170
Have we banged?

720
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:35,130
- I followed you on Instagram.

721
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:37,130
Everybody did till
they kicked you off.

722
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:39,190
- Oh, I know, right? Dicks.

723
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,030
- Well.

724
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:43,000
That explains all
the opium in the air.

725
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:44,170
Nice touch, I like it.

726
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:45,210
- It's pretty sweet, right?

727
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,223
- Mm-hmm, all right, all right.

728
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:48,110
What are you doing here?

729
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:49,170
Why do you want everyone
thinking you're Ember?

730
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,130
- Hey, so, you really want

731
00:39:51,131 --> 00:39:53,090
to go back to Earth, right?

732
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:55,110
No, I want you to answer
my fucking question.

733
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,770
- Thanks for popping in.

734
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:02,190
- Where is our High King?
- Who are you?

735
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:06,260
- A god is all you need to know.

736
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:15,190
- I'm glad you're back, Quentin.

737
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:19,260
I was getting a little
tired of the Brian game.

738
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:23,260
- Yeah, me too.

739
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,755
So maybe I missed something

740
00:40:30,756 --> 00:40:35,635
when we were playing, but...
you had to torture him

741
00:40:35,636 --> 00:40:38,010
to death.

742
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,010
Why, again?

743
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:45,190
- Gods are so tricky.

744
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:47,030
- Right.

745
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:51,130
But what about the one
that you were after today?

746
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:53,280
- Oh, we'll get him.

747
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,150
And I'll get back
what he took from me.

748
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:58,010
And then the others.

749
00:40:58,010 --> 00:40:59,110
They all took.

750
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:01,260
- Took what, exactly?

751
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:04,010
- See, that's what
I don't really know.

752
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:09,260
They took this part of
me that knew things.

753
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:13,030
It's not fair.

754
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:15,010
- No, yeah, totally.

755
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,230
They owe you.

756
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:20,230
Got it.

757
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:25,150
- You really
understand me, Quentin.

758
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:29,260
It's good to have
a friend like you.

759
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:38,210
- You know, speaking of
friends, when you get back

760
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:40,260
what the gods took from you...

761
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:48,210
maybe... could I
maybe have Eliot back?

762
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:52,210
- The one who tried to kill me?

763
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,680
- Hey, hey, no. No.

764
00:41:53,681 --> 00:41:55,150
That was a mistake.

765
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,215
- You were there.

766
00:41:56,216 --> 00:41:57,280
You...

767
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:02,000
like him more than me?

768
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:04,050
- No, I, I didn't say that.

769
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:06,150
- You miss him.

770
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:09,260
You... you miss all your friends.

771
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:14,210
The... the ones in my castle
who tried to kill me.

772
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,190
Good.

773
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:27,170
- Huh.

774
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:30,230
Well, upsides and downsides.

775
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:32,150
- Yeah, no,
I remember everything.

776
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:34,170
Kind of like a dream.

777
00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:37,050
- I was gonna say
acid trip myself.

778
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,210
Oh, my God.

779
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:49,050
Mis hermanos.

780
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:51,170
Where were you?
We looked everywhere.

781
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:53,090
Stay back.
- Why?

782
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,260
 Because I'm not here to play.
