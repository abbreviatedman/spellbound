quite gracefully.

Because it's too much.

it is not his choice.

repeat this, okay?

Write or breathe a single word and
there will be blood on your hands.

But the outstanding
business I'm attending to today

335
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:34,090

You're the best drinking
companion I've ever had.

339
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,437
Thanks. I mean, we
only drank together twice.

340
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,307
I'm a high-functioning
alcoholic, Walter.

341
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,773
We prefer to do our
serious drinking alone.

342
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:50,078
So that when we weep, we
can wallow in self-loathing

343
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:51,310
without embarrassment.

344
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:52,918
Did you get that,
Todd? Fantastic.

345
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:53,985
Excellent.

346
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,313
Walter, in my office bar

347
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:00,582
is an unopened bottle of
1977 Hollcroft single malt

348
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,095
that I was going to drink
if I ever committed suicide.

00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,031
Enjoy, my dear friend.

00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:08,263
It's not your fault I'm
always broke, Ashley.

351
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,266
I'm a degenerate gambler
who could use magic

352
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:11,634
to alter the outcome
of any game.

353
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:13,865
But then I couldn't relive
the secret shame I've held

354
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,238
since I was two years old.

355
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,335
What I crave most in the world
is the degradation of losing.

356
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:20,877
Thank you for every
single moment of that.

00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:22,381
You're $56 short.

Gold.

360
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,717
Magic has been a brutal
series of disappointments.

361
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:30,484
And after having
lived 40 timelines,

362
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:33,253
39 of which range from
the comically horrendous

363
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,794
to the apocalyptically absurd,

364
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:36,691
to find it was
all for nothing...

365
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:41,498
Well, leaving this life
actually feels liberating.

366
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:44,667
Hold this, Todd.
Thank you. Okay.

367
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,803
Tell Jennifer thank
you and goodbye.

368
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,237
I had an affair with his wife.

369
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,041
He behaved abominably.

370
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,781
Do you find all this as
cathartic as I do, Todd?

371
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,376
I think you really hurt him.

372
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:02,121
Well, back to my childhood.

373
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,520
I was raised by my grandmother,

374
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,854
the kindest, wisest
person I've ever known.

375
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,169
Of course, I could
never tell her that

376
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,321
because all forms
of intimacy horrify me.

377
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:14,530
"All forms of intimacy
terrify the hell out of me."

Yes?

380
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,270
Kim. What can I do for you?

381
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,278
Look, I'm pretty sure I
shouldn't tell you this.

382
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:30,176
Well, you probably shouldn't
have walked in and said that.

383
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:33,049
(SIGHS) I don't think
that I belong here.

384
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,514
As I said, it would
take some time.

385
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:38,720
And, I promise, you do.

386
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:43,088
Right, and you're literally the only
one that thinks that, and you're leaving.

387
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:45,623
Todd.

388
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:51,197
Look, it's not his
fault. He's just upset.

389
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,102
I am, too. Anybody
that knew would be.

390
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,401
Please.

391
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,944
(SIGHS) I probably
owe you an explanation.

392
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,909
My life is mostly
made up of regrets.

393
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,449
I'm not looking for
contradiction or pity.

394
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:12,557
It's just a fact I'm
suddenly forced to face.

395
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,317
But of all my many regrets

396
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:16,753
the greatest is something
I did very recently

397
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:20,061
to some of the most maddeningly
millennial students I ever had.

401
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:29,940
Were they gonna hit us?

402

Advantage of being
the spell caster.

403
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:36,115
I'll never be able to
correct what I did to them.

404
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,841
But, Kim, one day you might.

405
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:39,918
Me?

You have no idea
what you're capable of.

407
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,990
I do.

408
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,893
Okay, then if you want
me to help these students,

409
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,428
can you tell me who they are?

410
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,659
Their lives were
in grave danger.

411
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:58,063
I cast a spell that erased their
identities and gave them new ones,

412
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,301
and now that same spell
has been cast on me.

I mean, isn't there
anything you can do?

415
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:09,080
Well, if I reveal that the
spell can be reversed,

416
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,118
then someone would reverse
the spell on my students,

417
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,516
ensuring their deaths.

418
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,518
I will not allow that to happen.

419
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,347
I have to do this.

420
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,558

Ember was then sighted on the schooner
of the thin white duke off Basher Island,

482

where there was a celebration
for three days and nights.

483
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:10,823
Okay. Well, so far, every sighting
he either gets the party started

484
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:13,331
or he dives right into one
that's already jumping off.

enjoyed his pleasures,
