you gave Hansel.

However, a dance troupe
did die of exposure on a glacier,

291

quite gracefully.

enough to reverse this.

if he could be told

it's causing,

just pass one...

I have a cheating spell.

- I can't tell you.

319
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,016

- I promised.

320
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,817
- Right.
- Dean Fogg is leaving. Shit!

321
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,064
Why did I just say that?

322
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,190
Because it's too much.

323
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,758
Why do I have to be
the only one who knows?

324
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,444
Wait, he's leaving? Why?

325
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,491
Oh, believe me,
it is not his choice.

326
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,443
See, there's this Hedge Witch,
and she...

00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:16,121
Dean Fogg, hi!
Sorry, I'm late.

328
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,060

if you please don't repeat this,
okay?

330
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:20,868
Great. Thanks.
It's gonna be fine.

331
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:22,749
Oh, my God,
this is horrible.

00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:26,332
So, even after you're gone, nothing
about Marina can go in the memoir?

333
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:29,419
Write or breathe a single word
and there will be blood on your hands.

334
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,925
But the outstanding business
I'm attending to today

335
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,051
should be recorded
in minute detail.

00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:35,595
Walter.

00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,176
(CHUCKLING) Walter.

338
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:40,600
You're the best drinking
companion I've ever had.

339
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,398
Thanks. I mean,
we only drank together twice.

340
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,271
I'm a high-functioning
alcoholic, Walter.

341
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,732
We prefer to do
our serious drinking alone.

342
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:50,030
So that when we weep,
we can wallow in self-loathing

343
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,277
without embarrassment.

344
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,928
- Did you get that, Todd?
- Fantastic.

345
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:53,952
Excellent.

346
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,282
Walter, in my office bar

347
00:15:56,581 --> 00:16:00,541
is an unopened bottle
of 1977 Hollcroft single malt

348
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,039
that I was going to drink
if I ever committed suicide.

349
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,000
Enjoy, my dear friend.

350
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,226
It's not your fault
I'm always broke, Ashley.

351
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,216
I'm a degenerate gambler
who could use magic

352
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,589
to alter the outcome
of any game.

353
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,804
But then I couldn't relive
the secret shame I've held

354
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,176
since I was two years old.

355
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:18,304
What I crave most in the world
is the degradation of losing.

356
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,807
Thank you for every single
moment of that.

357
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,308
You're $56 short.

358
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,889
You're a cutthroat bookie.

Gold.

360
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,652
Magic has been a brutal
series of disappointments.

361
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,445
And after having lived
40 timelines,

362
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,194
39 of which range
from the comically horrendous

363
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:34,741
to the apocalyptically absurd,

364
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:36,652
to find it was
all for nothing...

365
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:41,452
Well, leaving this life
actually feels liberating.

366
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,622
- Hold this, Todd. Thank you.
- Okay.

367
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,749
Tell Jennifer thank you
and goodbye.

368
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,214
I had an affair
with his wife.

369
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,004
He behaved abominably.

370
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:58,716
Do you find all this
as cathartic as I do, Todd?

371
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,345
I think you really hurt him.

372
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:02,060
Well, back to my childhood.

373
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,478
I was raised
by my grandmother,

374
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,806
the kindest, wisest person
I've ever known.

375
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,127
Of course,
I could never tell her that

376
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,268
because all forms of intimacy
horrify me.

377
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:14,448
"All forms of intimacy
terrify the hell out of me."

Kim. What can I
do for you?

381
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:27,248
Look, I'm pretty sure
I shouldn't tell you this.

382
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:30,122
Well, you probably shouldn't
have walked in and said that.

383
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,999
(SIGHS) I don't think
that I belong here.

384
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,461
As I said,
it would take some time.

385
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,673
And, I promise, you do.

386
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:43,052
Right, and you're literally the only one
that thinks that, and you're leaving.

387
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:45,603
Todd.

388
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,147
Look, it's not his fault.
He's just upset.

389
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,069
I am, too.
Anybody that knew would be.

390
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,359
Please.

391
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,913
(SIGHS) I probably
owe you an explanation.

My life is mostly
made up of regrets.

I'm not looking for
contradiction or pity.

394
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,498
It's just a fact
I'm suddenly forced to face.

395
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,299
But of all my many regrets

396
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,714
the greatest is something
I did very recently

397
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:20,013
to some of the most maddeningly
millennial students I ever had.

Advantage of being
the spell caster.

403

I'll never be able to correct
what I did to them.

404

one day you might.

Me?

what you're capable of.

407
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:44,956
I do.

408
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,836
Okay, then if you want me
to help these students,

409
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,375
can you tell me who they are?

410
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,626
Their lives were
in grave danger.

411
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:58,009
I cast a spell that erased their identities
and gave them new ones,

412
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:01,259
and now that same spell
has been cast on me.

I mean, isn't there
anything you can do?

00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:09,021
Well, if I reveal that
the spell can be reversed,

416
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:12,065
then someone would reverse
the spell on my students,

417
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,483
ensuring their deaths.

418
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,482
I will not allow
that to happen.

Ember was then sighted on the schooner

482

where there was a celebration
for three days and nights.

483
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,778
Okay. Well, so far, every sighting
he either gets the party started

484

or he dives right into one
that's already jumping off.

enjoyed his pleasures,
