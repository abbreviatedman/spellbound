1
00:00:01,235 --> 00:00:02,931
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:04,494
<i>Alice is fine.</i>

3
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:06,506
<i>Depressed, surly.</i>

4
00:00:06,573 --> 00:00:08,041
<i>Still asking to see you again.</i>

5
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:11,506
<i>She's fixated on the thing
she says she saw in the castle.</i>

6
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:13,137
She's worried about her friends.

7
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,072
I can't think of anyone
better protected than they.

8
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:19,684
<i>They must stay where
they are, as they are.</i>

9
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,086
<i>They'll be fine.</i>

10
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:25,182
<i>Your spellwork was masterful.</i>

11
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,076
<i>There's something
you need to know</i>

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,160
and as soon as I start
telling you about this,

13
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:37,363
bad shit is gonna
start flying at our heads.

14
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,809
So, how do we figure
out who we really are?

15
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,344
Hi. I'm Marina.

16
00:00:44,745 --> 00:00:45,906
I'm here to help.

17
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:50,377
So, you're like some powerful,
benevolent white witch?

18
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,611
Uh-huh.

19
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:54,985
Let's take a peek underneath
and see what you really look like.

20
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:00,151
Fix it.

21
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:02,856
I don't know what
you want me to fix!

22
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,956
Whatever the
matter is in Fillory!

23
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:06,523
Hello?

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,634
Hello?

25
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:22,143
Old.

26
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:25,542
Things get old
so fast, don't they?

27
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:27,684
Sorry, but where are we?

28
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,120
I told you, Greece.

29
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:30,715
Right, right.

30
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:33,750
This is the temple of the
god we are summoning.

31
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:35,455
Enyalius.

32
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,062
God of war.

33
00:01:37,998 --> 00:01:39,432
Thought that was Ares.

34
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:43,599
Say that when you see him.

35
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:45,768
It makes him so mad.

36
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:48,466
So, okay. Go in the woods.

37
00:01:48,842 --> 00:01:49,842
Get a pig.

38
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,575
Excuse me? A wild pig.

39
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:53,646
The younger the better.

40
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:58,112
Sorry, I don't mean to be difficult,
but couldn't you just conjure one?

41
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:00,916
Hmm, no.

42
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:03,014
It has to be caught
with human hands

43
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:05,457
and stained with human effort.

44
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,593
You know, that... That stuff
that comes out of your skin.

45
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:11,326
Sweat?

46
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:12,598
Hurry.

47
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:17,535
What the fuck did you do?

48
00:02:17,938 --> 00:02:19,099
I didn't do anything.

49
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:20,663
That spell's a cunt with fangs.

50
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,601
I thought your amulet
was supposed to protect us.

51
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:26,169
It did. You're alive,
and welcome, asshole.

52
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,946
Great. Well, that didn't work
and we're back to square one.

53
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,720
Yeah? DEAN: <i>Hello,
whoever you are.</i>

54
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:41,787
<i>Do not tamper with
my enchantment.</i>

55
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:43,860
Holy shit, it's
James Earl Jones!

56
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:45,863
Shut up.

57
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:50,301
<i>Yes, you've triggered a
read-me file voicemail.</i>

58
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:53,697
<i>And, no, you may not
take me off speakerphone.</i>

59
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:57,344
<i>You will not circumvent
or defeat this spell.</i>

60
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,712
<i>Whoever you are, walk away. Now.</i>

61
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:04,548
<i>Or your death is as certain
as those I've enchanted.</i>

62
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:10,683
So, spells are
basically credit cards

63
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:12,851
with automated
fraud warning calls?

64
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:15,019
That's not super inspired.

65
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,355
Well, neither is Henry Fogg,

66
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:20,557
nor his favorite
students, right?

67
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:24,404
Sit in the kitchen
until I tell you it's safe.

68
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,566
You stay.

69
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:33,543
She scares me.

70
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:35,411
Yeah, well, she's not
the one with the Glock.

71
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,844
I've got a theory
about you, stud.

72
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,081
Stand close.

73
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:44,917
Ooh.

74
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,868
Oh, Henry. Such a good try.

75
00:03:56,136 --> 00:03:58,298
What are you doing?

76
00:03:58,538 --> 00:04:00,666
Ow.

77
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,369
I'm making you useful.

78
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:04,567
Wait.

79
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:06,239
Where's Janet?

80
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:09,541
Hello?

81
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,213
Anyone?

82
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,378
Mother Nature, can you hear me?

83
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:16,082
Wow, forests don't even talk.

84
00:04:16,156 --> 00:04:18,887
Whole psychotic break
just lacks imagination.

85
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:29,801
Again.

86
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,067
Jesus. Dude.

87
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:35,335
The chips.

88
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:38,401
How am I doing this?

89
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,781
Yes.

90
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:51,285
This pond better be vodka.

91
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:25,819
Your Majesty?

92
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:30,463
Jesus Christ.

93
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:37,803
Forgive the suddenness
of my introduction.

94
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:41,205
I know you're not quite
yourself, King Margo.

95
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:43,336
What are you?

96
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:44,868
Where am I?

97
00:05:45,212 --> 00:05:48,376
And why does everybody in this
nightmare keep calling me king?

98
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:50,048
Is that even a thing?

99
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,748
I'll endeavor to explain.

100
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,098
Hello.

101
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,657
You're being kind of quiet.

102
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:12,763
Look, you're nice and all.

103
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:16,099
Sort of. But I... I could use
some intel on this place,

104
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:18,202
but how do I know
you're not a snitch?

105
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:21,174
Well, because like
it or not, I'm Santa.

106
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:25,018
Which used to mean I was
once considered fairly honest.

107
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,683
Reasonably reliable,
but I... I don't know.

108
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:28,846
Maybe, uh,

109
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,114
slightly admired.

110
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:33,390
Then all of a sudden
it was like, "Hey,

111
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,294
"you break into houses once
a year. What's up with that?"

112
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:38,730
And, "Kids sit on your lap.

113
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:40,800
"How is that not creepy?"

114
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,203
Congratulations, Earth.

115
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:45,428
You ruined the name of Santa.

116
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:48,765
So, you don't want
to hear from me?

117
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:50,936
Good.

118
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:54,672
'Cause I'm sure you don't
need this thing I could get you,

119
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:55,943
called magic.

120
00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:59,309
How?

121
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:04,656
I am the Lord of All
Fillorian Fresh Water.

122
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:07,550
Which is a bit pretentious,

123
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:10,119
so, please, call me Lord Fresh.

124
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:14,498
Assuming this is actually
happening, you pulled me down here.

125
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:15,834
Why?

126
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,501
Your birthright box.

127
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:20,368
You and my birth
box ain't happening,

128
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,341
so back up, <i>Shape of Water.</i>

129
00:07:22,409 --> 00:07:26,312
No, no. Your birthright box.

130
00:07:27,147 --> 00:07:28,979
There. Oh.

131
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:30,506
Right.

132
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,017
No, Majesty!

133
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,977
If you touch it,
it will harm you.

134
00:07:35,522 --> 00:07:38,117
Even my protective
wards couldn't save you.

135
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:40,020
You know about that spell shit?

136
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,023
I'm really somebody else,

137
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:44,690
and if I try to figure out who
shit clobbers me, burns me?

138
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:45,888
Correct.

139
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:48,526
Though, as I said,
you're safe down here.

140
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,563
Your birthright box,

141
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:52,799
which it has been
my honor to guard,

142
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,873
dictated your absence
from the kingdom,

143
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,740
your loss of self,

144
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,610
and your return
this day and hour.

145
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,773
But I must caution.

146
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:04,708
It also predicted

147
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,416
that you would learn what it is

148
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,888
to live and rule alone.

149
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,156
Yeah?

150
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,987
Well, alone's my
jam, <i>grenouille.</i>

151
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,990
And no matter what, I rule.

152
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,504
Your enchantment
is most powerful.

153
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,373
I'm not sure that
my wards will hold.

154
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,810
To come back and
claim your destiny,

155
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:34,006
you must find the god who
summoned you in the dream.

156
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:37,647
Please accept my apologies.

157
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:40,846
I'm afraid I can't keep
you as safe as I had hoped.

158
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,093
Walk toward the mountains.

159
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:54,498
My destiny is to die
of pneumonia, isn't it?

160
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:55,858
You can tell me.

161
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,198
Hardly, Majesty.

162
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:59,664
Please return when
the spell is lifted.

163
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,703
Here's your lunch.

164
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:03,906
Ugh!

165
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,879
Well, if he's anything
like my Henry,

166
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,890
he keeps most of his secrets

167
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:20,253
in here.

168
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:28,960
Todd.

169
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,534
Oh, my God.

170
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:32,966
Hansel?

171
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:35,237
Hey. We gotta hustle.

172
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,242
Yeah, uh...

173
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,469
Anything I... I can do?

174
00:09:39,546 --> 00:09:42,311
Yeah. Take your shirt off
and make me a sandwich.

175
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:49,822
Sorry, but I'm starved.

176
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:53,326
If it helps, I'm vegan,
so this sucks for me, too.

177
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:01,160
Todd? Jesus, are you drunk?

178
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,806
Marina.

179
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,011
Hello, Henry.

180
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,573
What is this? What did you do?

181
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:17,514
It's the same blue
shit you gave Hansel.

182
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,385
Only I knew you wouldn't
drink it at my request.

183
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,648
So, here's the deal.

184
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:23,335
Give yourself the antidote.

185
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,819
There is no antidote.

186
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:26,185
Bullshit.

187
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:27,379
Whoa, hoo, hoo, hoo!

188
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,319
So, it's true!

189
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:33,057
Everything she's
been telling us is true!

190
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,362
Us?

191
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:35,800
Who else is involved in this?

192
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:39,806
Pretty much all of your apple-shining,
ass-kissing teacher's pets.

193
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:41,083
Oh, Christ.

194
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:44,202
Whatever she's saying she's
going to do to help you, she isn't.

195
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:46,155
And how are you talking
about this without...

196
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:47,511
Being attacked by the world?

197
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,358
It's magic, remember?

198
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:50,714
What timeline are you from?

199
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:52,479
The one where you
owe me child support.

200
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:57,080
I'm kidding. So, the
spell takes, what,

201
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,625
a day to kick in?

202
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:00,186
It's almost dawn.

203
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,527
You say there's no antidote.

204
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:04,661
You better get to
a lab and get to it.

205
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:07,566
Because I'm not
turning you into a DJ.

206
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:09,461
No.

207
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:12,033
You won't like the new you.

208
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:16,035
Unless you have a secret
dream to live in a moving box.

209
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:21,571
You just hit the
rethink button, okay?

210
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,178
Let's go.

211
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:27,413
Bye.

212
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:29,981
Jesus.

213
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:32,917
Todd.

214
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,689
How long have you been awake?

215
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,223
We need to get
you some help. No.

216
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:40,634
And what you just
saw dies with you.

217
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,700
Do you understand?

218
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,741
This cannot continue.

219
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:59,408
An infinity of pardons,
Acting High King Fen.

220
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,749
There is an urgent matter.

221
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,686
An urgent poacher?

222
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,058
Who claims to be the High King.

223
00:12:09,128 --> 00:12:10,239
So, an urgent, insane poacher.

224
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:11,959
Was my first thought. Until?

225
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:14,227
The name was uttered.

226
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:30,282
So,

227
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,582
you claim to be High King

228
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,816
Margo? No!

229
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:41,093
Ow!

230
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:43,863
There you have it. So,
every time you say...

231
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:46,763
Weird, huh?

232
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,535
You look nothing like her.

233
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,661
Look.

234
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:55,007
I'm not saying I'm who
we are not talking about.

235
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:57,805
But I had this dream
where this goat god, Amber?

236
00:12:57,977 --> 00:12:59,001
Ember. Ember.

237
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:00,474
Whatevs.

238
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,840
Said I had to get
here quick and dirty.

239
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:04,076
The reports are true.

240
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,946
Ember has indeed
returned to Fillory.

241
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,747
Miraculously risen
from the dead.

242
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,051
Look, if you know
where this Ember is...

243
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,421
We don't, is the problem.

244
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:14,959
We don't want to
find him. We have to.

245
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:17,697
Something's happened
since his return.

246
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:22,362
Oh, I'm nodding so you hurry

247
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:25,530
and you get to something
I actually understand.

248
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,005
Oh.

249
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:31,069
Our air has always been graced

250
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:33,670
with what you on
Earth call opium.

251
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:36,114
But now it's saturated.

252
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:38,481
For some it's tolerable.

253
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,078
Some get quite giddy,

254
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:43,146
a few succumb to sleep at
the most inconvenient times,

255
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:45,214
and then there are those who...

256
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,484
Dance. In the nude.

257
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,495
It sounds lighthearted,

258
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:52,293
but it's actually resulted
in a number of deaths,

259
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:54,766
mainly in falling asleep
in the wrong place

260
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,063
at the wrong time.

261
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:58,502
Trampled in the middle of the
road being the most common.

262
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:02,474
However, a dance troupe did
die of exposure on a glacier,

263
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:05,841
though, by all accounts,
quite gracefully.

264
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:07,674
Magic is now rationed.

265
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:09,943
And none of it is powerful
enough to reverse this.

266
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,178
And since it coincides
with Ember's return...

267
00:14:12,385 --> 00:14:14,877
His glorious resurrection
and divine rule!

268
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:16,512
We hope.

269
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:19,819
We've come to believe
that this is his doing.

270
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,359
And perhaps if he could be told

271
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:23,760
of the damage it's causing,

272
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,822
he could be convinced
to reverse this.

273
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,428
Guys.

274
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,900
I need to stress

275
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,759
how much I don't give a shit.

276
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:32,237
Oh.

277
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,333
But he's dodging you

278
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:35,841
and he wants me.

279
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,101
So, let's find the fucker.

280
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:42,843
Sassy.

281
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:47,317
Hi. Hi! Kim, sorry, I'm late.

282
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,387
No, this won't take long.

283
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:49,717
I think I'm flunking out.

284
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:51,348
Oh, first-year
nerves, totally normal.

285
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:53,518
No, no, no, I am
literally failing everything.

286
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:54,670
I mean, if I could
just pass one...

287
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:56,372
And somebody told you
I have a cheating spell.

288
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,456
Yes. Okay, I will hook
you up but right now,

289
00:14:58,531 --> 00:14:59,624
I'm trying not to freak.

290
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:00,776
What's wrong? I can't tell you.

291
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,063
Okay. I promised.

292
00:15:02,135 --> 00:15:03,865
Right. Dean Fogg
is leaving. Shit!

293
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:05,131
Why did I just say that?

294
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:06,228
Because it's too much.

295
00:15:06,305 --> 00:15:07,783
Why do I have to be
the only one who knows?

296
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:09,469
Wait, he's leaving? Why?

297
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:11,541
Oh, believe me,
it is not his choice.

298
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:13,512
See, there's this
Hedge Witch, and she...

299
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,139
Dean Fogg, hi! Sorry, I'm late.

300
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,093
I will give you every
cheating spell I have

301
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,528
if you please don't
repeat this, okay?

302
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:20,918
Great. Thanks.
It's gonna be fine.

303
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:22,819
Oh, my God, this is horrible.

304
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:26,382
So, even after you're gone, nothing
about Marina can go in the memoir?

305
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:29,486
Write or breathe a single word and
there will be blood on your hands.

306
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:31,997
But the outstanding
business I'm attending to today

307
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:34,090
should be recorded
in minute detail.

308
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,624
Walter.

309
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,229
Walter.

310
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,664
You're the best drinking
companion I've ever had.

311
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,437
Thanks. I mean, we
only drank together twice.

312
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,307
I'm a high-functioning
alcoholic, Walter.

313
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,773
We prefer to do our
serious drinking alone.

314
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:50,078
So that when we weep, we
can wallow in self-loathing

315
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:51,310
without embarrassment.

316
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:52,918
Did you get that,
Todd? Fantastic.

317
00:15:52,985 --> 00:15:53,985
Excellent.

318
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,313
Walter, in my office bar

319
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:00,582
is an unopened bottle of
1977 Hollcroft single malt

320
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,095
that I was going to drink
if I ever committed suicide.

321
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,031
Enjoy, my dear friend.

322
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:08,263
It's not your fault I'm
always broke, Ashley.

323
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,266
I'm a degenerate gambler
who could use magic

324
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:11,634
to alter the outcome
of any game.

325
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:13,865
But then I couldn't relive
the secret shame I've held

326
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,238
since I was two years old.

327
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:18,335
What I crave most in the world
is the degradation of losing.

328
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:20,877
Thank you for every
single moment of that.

329
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:22,381
You're $56 short.

330
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:23,939
You're a cutthroat bookie.

331
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:26,117
Gold.

332
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,717
Magic has been a brutal
series of disappointments.

333
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:30,484
And after having
lived 40 timelines,

334
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:33,253
39 of which range from
the comically horrendous

335
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,794
to the apocalyptically absurd,

336
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:36,691
to find it was
all for nothing...

337
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:41,498
Well, leaving this life
actually feels liberating.

338
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:44,667
Hold this, Todd.
Thank you. Okay.

339
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,803
Tell Jennifer thank
you and goodbye.

340
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,237
I had an affair with his wife.

341
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,041
He behaved abominably.

342
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:58,781
Do you find all this as
cathartic as I do, Todd?

343
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,376
I think you really hurt him.

344
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:02,121
Well, back to my childhood.

345
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,520
I was raised by my grandmother,

346
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,854
the kindest, wisest
person I've ever known.

347
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,169
Of course, I could
never tell her that

348
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:09,321
because all forms
of intimacy horrify me.

349
00:17:10,263 --> 00:17:14,530
"All forms of intimacy
terrify the hell out of me."

350
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:17,736
Yes?

351
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,270
Kim. What can I do for you?

352
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,278
Look, I'm pretty sure I
shouldn't tell you this.

353
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:30,176
Well, you probably shouldn't
have walked in and said that.

354
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:33,049
I don't think that
I belong here.

355
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,514
As I said, it would
take some time.

356
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:38,720
And, I promise, you do.

357
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:43,088
Right, and you're literally the only
one that thinks that, and you're leaving.

358
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:45,623
Todd.

359
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:51,197
Look, it's not his
fault. He's just upset.

360
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,102
I am, too. Anybody
that knew would be.

361
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,401
Please.

362
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,944
I probably owe
you an explanation.

363
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,909
My life is mostly
made up of regrets.

364
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,449
I'm not looking for
contradiction or pity.

365
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:12,557
It's just a fact I'm
suddenly forced to face.

366
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,317
But of all my many regrets

367
00:18:14,727 --> 00:18:16,753
the greatest is something
I did very recently

368
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:20,061
to some of the most maddeningly
millennial students I ever had.

369
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,297
What...

370
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:29,940
Were they gonna hit us?

371
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,642
Advantage of being
the spell caster.

372
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:36,115
I'll never be able to
correct what I did to them.

373
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,841
But, Kim, one day you might.

374
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:39,918
Me?

375
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:43,150
You have no idea
what you're capable of.

376
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,990
I do.

377
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,893
Okay, then if you want
me to help these students,

378
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,428
can you tell me who they are?

379
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,659
Their lives were
in grave danger.

380
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:58,063
I cast a spell that erased their
identities and gave them new ones,

381
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,301
and now that same spell
has been cast on me.

382
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:03,538
Jesus.

383
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:06,188
I mean, isn't there
anything you can do?

384
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:09,080
Well, if I reveal that the
spell can be reversed,

385
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,118
then someone would reverse
the spell on my students,

386
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:13,516
ensuring their deaths.

387
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,518
I will not allow that to happen.

388
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,347
I have to do this.

389
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,558
I must accept this.

390
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:34,368
Hmm...

391
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,885
Ah, stubborn dude.

392
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:51,821
You got Plan B?

393
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:53,723
B plans are for losers.

394
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,119
Okay.

395
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,493
Uh... Well, whatever
happens, thank you for trying.

396
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:00,965
I don't really know

397
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,231
why you're putting
yourself out so much for us,

398
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:06,937
but it's pretty cool.

399
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:09,174
Well, it's pretty
common knowledge

400
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,107
that I'm a very,
very good person

401
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:12,668
who lives to help others.

402
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:16,448
Mmm.

403
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:19,445
Oh.

404
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,011
It's such a piece of shit.

405
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:25,425
Hey. I like the artwork.

406
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,017
Yep. Sure.

407
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,385
You have to admit,
the characters? Us?

408
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,193
We're pretty complex.

409
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,227
Oh, yeah, real complex.

410
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,968
Yeah, Isaac's big problem
is his dick is too big.

411
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:39,972
Hey. It can be a problem.

412
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:41,635
Seriously.

413
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:43,869
It narrows the field by a
lot more than you think.

414
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,876
I've been on way too many first
dates that end in urgent care, so...

415
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:49,347
Gross. HANSEL: Look.

416
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:51,816
My life is pretty cool,

417
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:56,915
so, how do I know
this other me is gonna...

418
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,389
Nail as many groupies?

419
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:00,521
Whoa, hey, whoa, no.

420
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:04,758
That is not what
Hansel is about, okay?

421
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:08,494
You think there's a chance the
real you didn't bang your sister?

422
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,232
Hey, no, isn't that...

423
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,533
She was my stepsister, okay?

424
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,039
Stepsister.

425
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,836
And we didn't
know till... Till later.

426
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:16,932
Mmm.

427
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:18,506
Too many stepdads.

428
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:20,235
All right, well, what about you?

429
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,779
What's your kink? Me?

430
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:24,677
No, see, I'm perfect.

431
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:27,453
Yeah, I catch drug
dealers, murderers,

432
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,148
arsonists, blackmailers, pimps.

433
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:32,016
I even stopped a girl from giving
herself a coat-hanger abortion

434
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:34,424
and got her to Planned
Parenthood. You see, I...

435
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:35,586
I'm a hero.

436
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:37,194
So, why would you give that up?

437
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:38,458
You sound awesome.

438
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,497
I sound fake.

439
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,328
Which I am.

440
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,132
Oh, like your thunder meat.

441
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,633
All right, easy. It's...

442
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:49,433
It's... It's a meat.

443
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,971
I don't know if it's thunder.

444
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:55,439
We just never know
where his celestial,

445
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:58,279
newly risen godliness
is going to pop up next.

446
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,214
From the brothel in
the Lower Meerskin,

447
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:04,553
Ember was then sighted on the schooner
of the thin white duke off Basher Island,

448
00:22:04,623 --> 00:22:07,115
where there was a celebration
for three days and nights.

449
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:10,823
Okay. Well, so far, every sighting
he either gets the party started

450
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:13,331
or he dives right into one
that's already jumping off.

451
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,127
Ember has always
enjoyed his pleasures,

452
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:17,966
but this pace reeks
of self-destruction.

453
00:22:18,204 --> 00:22:19,263
Please.

454
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,738
One July 4th,

455
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:23,275
I bet I could snort my
body weight in coke.

456
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,640
This dude's an amateur.

457
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:26,171
Next.

458
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:31,749
Landfall at Shimmering
Cliff Palace, then an orgy

459
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:33,713
at Sacred Sky Nunnery.

460
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,853
Okay. That's almost impressive.

461
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:40,625
So, look, he's headed east.

462
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:43,219
If he keeps going,
what's the next hotspot?

463
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,058
The Hare on the Ass.

464
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,423
Seriously?

465
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:51,936
Whimsy.

466
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,070
I fucking hate it.

467
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:57,476
So, you found a whole
family of them, huh?

468
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:58,738
Mmm.

469
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,542
What happened to the mother pig?

470
00:23:06,452 --> 00:23:07,511
Kill it.

471
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,053
What?

472
00:23:09,355 --> 00:23:12,120
Enyalius won't come
without a sacrifice, silly.

473
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:13,892
Here.

474
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:16,093
Slit its belly open, please.

475
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,920
Entrails on the altar.

476
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:21,525
No, I'm not, I'm not...

477
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:25,865
Look, I'm a person with a
job and a girlfriend and a life,

478
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,472
and I'm not your... Your
pal. Or your playmate.

479
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:31,574
And I'm not scared
of you anymore.

480
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:34,407
So, why don't you
just fucking kill me?

481
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:36,947
I would never do that.

482
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,410
Ah!

483
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:52,256
Hello, Etta.

484
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:58,167
Oh, I suppose this is
why you summoned me.

485
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:02,632
Thank you.

486
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,675
Oh, and the answer is no.

487
00:24:04,977 --> 00:24:06,843
Your new suit is
not finished yet.

488
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,244
Oh, pity.

489
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:10,639
You are usually
not this impatient.

490
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:13,986
Henry, would you like to
see the work in progress?

491
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,620
Oh, yes.

492
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:16,947
Okay.

493
00:24:21,193 --> 00:24:22,193
Ah.

494
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,089
Beautiful.

495
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,092
Of course.

496
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,363
Damn it. What in the world?

497
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,029
Magic ration.

498
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:34,900
My office had some
unexpected visitors today

499
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:36,875
who took a huge
portion of today's magic.

500
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:39,604
Ah. No worries.

501
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,005
Smell.

502
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:52,486
I'm sorry.

503
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:55,360
That's my grandmother's
huckleberry pie.

504
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:57,021
Wait, what?

505
00:24:57,863 --> 00:24:59,161
What is it, Henry?

506
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:05,163
So, why a comic book?

507
00:25:05,704 --> 00:25:07,468
Graphic novel, Etta.

508
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,640
Had a lot of characters
with detailed backstories.

509
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,138
And I could look at them.

510
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:16,144
So, the glamour was
much easier to cast.

511
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:17,914
Doesn't matter now.

512
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,911
I'm about to live
a version of it.

513
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:23,546
Though, I'm assured,
one not quite as nice.

514
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:26,925
Well, you seem awfully sanguine.

515
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,590
Fate's a fucker
that always wins.

516
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,888
Okay, I've known you for 22...

517
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,057
Well, 23 years now.

518
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:38,595
And I've loved you
dearly every moment.

519
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,764
Fully aware that you
can barely stand yourself.

520
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:44,940
And that made me sad,

521
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:48,842
but it also made you
my best customer.

522
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:50,407
How so?

523
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,241
Isn't it obvious?

524
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:57,382
Come on, the bespoke
suits, the hand-sewn shirts...

525
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:01,889
It's armor.

526
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:05,189
It's an armor to
keep the world away.

527
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,757
A disguise so that nobody

528
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,965
can see what a truly
loving heart you have.

529
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:26,045
You said if revealed,
the spell can be reversed.

530
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:27,950
Kim. Don't.

531
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,059
I'm one of them, aren't I?

532
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:39,164
You have to undo
this on all of us.

533
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:40,991
And then what?

534
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:42,227
And then we fight.

535
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:43,826
I know I can't stop you.

536
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:48,103
But please, be more careful now

537
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:49,766
than you've ever
been in your life.

538
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:52,071
Well, lives.

539
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:02,780
Finally getting to
be your teacher

540
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:08,359
has been an honor.

541
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,953
You're now the saddest
loser I ever buried.

542
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,655
Look.

543
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:55,567
Marina.

544
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:57,870
Hi, Dad.

545
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:17,761
How's it going?

546
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:22,926
Got it.

547
00:28:28,674 --> 00:28:29,767
Do you feel it?

548
00:28:32,778 --> 00:28:34,007
Stronger further up.

549
00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:36,112
My arm wouldn't
even fit in there.

550
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:47,691
Go, little buddy. Come on.

551
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,591
Come on, little buddy.

552
00:29:17,556 --> 00:29:19,752
Hey. Hey, come on
now. Little narration.

553
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:21,284
Fuck off.

554
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,395
Come on, little buddy.

555
00:29:52,658 --> 00:29:53,682
Yes?

556
00:29:57,429 --> 00:29:58,556
I realize that.

557
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,360
But these dossiers are private.

558
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:05,027
Holy shit.

559
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:21,211
Sorry, little buddy.

560
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:22,377
What happened?

561
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:24,382
What?

562
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:27,856
Did... Did anyone ever tell you
you're kind of withholding, you know?

563
00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:31,588
Oh, come on. You're not trying
to kill yourself again, are you?

564
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:32,961
No.

565
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:38,700
Hey, is all of that chimney
stuff about you true?

566
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,734
Never met one I couldn't crack.

567
00:30:46,545 --> 00:30:49,344
Leg next? No, no, no, no, no.

568
00:30:49,414 --> 00:30:51,883
Okay, I'm ready.
Whatever you want, okay?

569
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:55,377
Ah.

570
00:30:56,655 --> 00:30:58,180
Oh.

571
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:02,925
Time to die. Yes, it is.

572
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,527
Give me a little goodbye kiss.

573
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,030
Yes.

574
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,830
Explains a lot of weird shit,

575
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:17,635
but I promised I'd keep
everything about him private.

576
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,709
Okay.

577
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:21,607
Yeah, and I'm
trying to save him.

578
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,875
So, please.

579
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:28,086
How was that? Was it good?

580
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,044
Yeah. Can I have one?

581
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:31,950
Oh, yes. Of course.

582
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:33,748
Thank you.

583
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:41,623
Magic's supposed
to stay on till 11:00.

584
00:31:42,534 --> 00:31:43,968
Spells take magic, right?

585
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:46,868
Which is rationed. Which sucks.

586
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:51,135
And a spell like this would take even
more power than a normal one, right?

587
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:53,701
I mean, think about it. It's
six, seven, eight people?

588
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:55,907
Plus whole lives?

589
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:58,811
No. If you had any
interruption in the flow...

590
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,280
Wait. Magic's off.

591
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:05,582
It's him.

592
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:07,535
It's the spell. He told me
that it would try and kill us.

593
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,460
Right, but without magic, how...

594
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:11,221
Shit.

595
00:32:11,463 --> 00:32:12,795
Maybe he actually finished it.

596
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:14,658
Finished what?

597
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:16,463
This thing he
worked on for years.

598
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:19,299
A perpetual battery.

599
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,664
Come on.

600
00:32:26,478 --> 00:32:27,912
Pray a little harder, please.

601
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,917
Is that suckling I smell?

602
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,416
Enyalius?

603
00:32:38,924 --> 00:32:40,256
Well, fuck, yeah, it is.

604
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:41,791
You know what's funny?

605
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:43,694
He sacrificed the pig.

606
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:45,019
He prayed.

607
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:46,696
And he's never heard of you.

608
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:56,002
How dare you?

609
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:05,045
I want it back.

610
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,949
Give it to me.

611
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:10,687
Well, I have no
idea what "it" is,

612
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,859
but I grant you permission to
search my ball sack with your tongue.

613
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:17,154
Fine.

614
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:19,895
I'll just take it.

615
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:02,039
Okay, so,

616
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,506
remember, Fogg said
be really, really careful.

617
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:06,601
Because...

618
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,081
Oh, my God. Kim?

619
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:12,342
Kim.

620
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:15,348
No, no.

621
00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:17,514
No, no, no.

622
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:21,557
Yeah, I need a medic.

623
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,089
Yeah, I think she's...

624
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,428
Sorry, prank.

625
00:34:29,968 --> 00:34:31,937
Kim. Are you okay?

626
00:34:33,772 --> 00:34:34,967
Fine.

627
00:34:35,874 --> 00:34:37,308
No, see.

628
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:39,411
You kind of

629
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:41,135
died.

630
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,908
Well, maybe being
un-killable is my discipline.

631
00:34:47,052 --> 00:34:49,544
Yeah, that's not a thing.

632
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:53,390
Hey.

633
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:56,353
How much juice do
you think this thing has?

634
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:58,294
Well, it's perpetual.

635
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,258
So,

636
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:02,666
it can be overloaded.

637
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:04,930
I have no idea.

638
00:35:06,071 --> 00:35:08,165
Oh, shit!

639
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:10,169
How is this a good idea?

640
00:35:30,095 --> 00:35:31,154
Oh, God.

641
00:35:31,596 --> 00:35:33,292
It's not in there!

642
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:39,195
You're not Enyalius, are you?

643
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:41,872
You're his servant.

644
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,304
A Corybant. Aren't you?

645
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:48,780
All right, look, he's... He's
not who you want, so just...

646
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,214
You know, let him go.

647
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:52,616
All right?

648
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,217
Why did your master
send you to trick me?

649
00:35:59,024 --> 00:36:00,185
He knows.

650
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,016
It's not even midday.

651
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:29,145
Real ragers rave in the day.

652
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:37,589
Horn guy. Is that him?

653
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:48,031
Who is that?

654
00:36:48,606 --> 00:36:49,699
An imposter.

655
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:51,538
No wonder he won't see
anyone who knows him.

656
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:52,907
Hey. Ember.

657
00:36:55,847 --> 00:36:56,906
I'm here.

658
00:36:57,749 --> 00:36:59,240
Yeah, you are.

659
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:00,845
Congrats.

660
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,720
Where are your hooves?

661
00:37:42,961 --> 00:37:43,985
Todd!

662
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,639
Quentin. You're back.

663
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:37,309
Oh.

664
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:39,882
You wanted to play.

665
00:38:40,685 --> 00:38:42,654
Sorry. He's too dead.

666
00:38:47,292 --> 00:38:49,591
Cool trick. Do it again.

667
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,889
Okay, what the what now?

668
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:21,015
What the fuck are you
doing here, Bacchus?

669
00:39:21,993 --> 00:39:23,359
All right.

670
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:24,756
Have we banged?

671
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:26,622
I followed you on Instagram.

672
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,599
Everybody did till
they kicked you off.

673
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:31,166
Oh, I know, right? Dicks.

674
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:32,461
Well,

675
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:34,369
that explains all
the opium in the air.

676
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:35,668
Nice touch, I like it.

677
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:37,207
It's pretty sweet, right?

678
00:39:37,442 --> 00:39:39,604
Mmm-hmm. All right, all
right. What are you doing here?

679
00:39:39,677 --> 00:39:41,255
Why do you want everyone
thinking you're Ember?

680
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:44,374
Hey, so, you really want
to go back to Earth, right?

681
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:46,475
No, I want you to answer
my fucking question.

682
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:47,780
Thanks for popping in.

683
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,221
Where is our High King?

684
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:53,584
Who are you?

685
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,454
A god

686
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,752
is all you need to know.

687
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:06,699
I'm glad you're back, Quentin.

688
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:11,076
I was getting a little
tired of the Brian game.

689
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:14,871
Yeah. Me, too.

690
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:24,880
So, maybe I missed something
when we were playing,

691
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:29,052
but you had to
torture him to death.

692
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:32,592
Why, again?

693
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:36,066
Gods are so tricky.

694
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:37,895
Right.

695
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,740
But what about the one
that you were after today?

696
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,336
Oh, we'll get him.

697
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,436
And I'll get back
what he took from me.

698
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,342
And then the others.

699
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:50,638
They all took.

700
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:52,507
Took what, exactly?

701
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,310
See, that's what I
don't really know.

702
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,919
They took this part of me

703
00:40:58,823 --> 00:41:01,019
that knew things.

704
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:04,118
It's not fair.

705
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:06,086
No, yeah, totally.

706
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:08,997
They owe you.

707
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:11,997
Got it.

708
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:16,437
You really understand
me, Quentin.

709
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:21,342
It's good to have
a friend like you.

710
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:27,545
You know, speaking of friends,

711
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:31,951
when you get back what
the gods took from you,

712
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:35,788
maybe...

713
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:39,825
Could I maybe have Eliot back?

714
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:43,728
The one who tried to kill me?

715
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:46,531
Hey, hey, no. No.
That was a mistake.

716
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:49,039
You were there. Do you

717
00:41:51,209 --> 00:41:53,405
like him more than me?

718
00:41:53,678 --> 00:41:55,510
No, I... I didn't say that.

719
00:41:55,747 --> 00:41:56,976
You miss him.

720
00:41:58,016 --> 00:42:01,180
You... You miss
all your friends.

721
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:02,652
The...

722
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,815
The ones in my castle
who tried to kill me.

723
00:42:11,596 --> 00:42:12,757
Good.

724
00:42:17,735 --> 00:42:18,828
Huh.

725
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:21,498
Well, upsides and downsides.

726
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,884
Yeah, no, I remember everything.

727
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:25,206
Kind of like a dream.

728
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:28,072
I was gonna say
acid trip myself.

729
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:36,615
Oh, my God.

730
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:40,218
<i>Mis hermanos.</i>

731
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:42,656
Where were you? We...
We looked everywhere.

732
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:44,355
Stay back. Why?

733
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,266
Because I'm not here to play.
