00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:02,872
<i>Previously on</i>
The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:04,452
<i>Alice is fine.</i>

3
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:06,458
<i>Depressed, surly.</i>

4
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:08,005
<i>Still asking to see you again.</i>

5
00:00:08,258 --> 00:00:11,467
<i>She's fixated on the thing
she says she saw in the castle.</i>

6
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:13,089
She's worried
about her friends.

7
00:00:13,555 --> 00:00:16,047
I can't think of anyone
better protected than they.

8
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:19,642
<i>They must stay where they are,
as they are.</i>

9
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,015
<i>They'll be fine.</i>

10
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:25,143
<i>Your spellwork was masterful.</i>

11
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:33,051
<i>There's something
you need to know</i>

12
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:35,112
and as soon as I start
telling you about this,

13
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,319
bad shit is gonna start
flying at our heads.

14
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:42,745
So, how do we figure out
who we really are?

15
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,291
Hi. I'm Marina.

16
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:45,872
I'm here to help.

17
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:50,332
So, you're like some powerful,
benevolent white witch?

18
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:51,541
Uh-huh.

19
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:54,924
Let's take a peek underneath
and see what you really look like.

20
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,095
Fix it.

21
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,802
I don't know what
you want me to fix!

22
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,888
Whatever the matter
is in Fillory!

23
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:06,473
Hello?

24
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,607
Hello?

25
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,121
Old.

26
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:25,492
Things get old
so fast, don't they?

27
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,622
Sorry, but where are we?

28
00:01:27,713 --> 00:01:29,079
I told you, Greece.

29
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:30,667
Right, right.

30
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,708
This is the temple
of the god we are summoning.

31
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:35,419
Enyalius.

32
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,003
God of war.

33
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:39,384
Thought that was Ares.

34
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:43,552
Say that
when you see him.

35
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,720
It makes him so mad.

36
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,439
So, okay.
Go in the woods.

37
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:49,817
Get a pig.

38
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:52,523
- Excuse me?
- A wild pig.

39
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:53,613
The younger the better.

40
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:58,070
Sorry, I don't mean to be difficult,
but couldn't you just conjure one?

41
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:00,868
Hmm, no.

42
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,946
It has to be caught
with human hands

43
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,407
and stained
with human effort.

44
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:08,543
You know, that...
That stuff that comes out of your skin.

45
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:11,288
Sweat?

46
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,548
Hurry.

47
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:17,510
What the fuck
did you do?

48
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,049
I didn't do anything.

49
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:20,630
That spell's
a cunt with fangs.

50
00:02:21,016 --> 00:02:23,554
I thought your amulet
was supposed to protect us.

51
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,136
It did. You're alive,
and welcome, asshole.

52
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:29,890
Great. Well, that didn't work
and we're back to square one.

53
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:38,690
- Yeah?
<i>- Hello, whoever you are.</i>

54
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,742
<i>Do not tamper
with my enchantment.</i>

55
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,824
Holy shit,
it's James Earl Jones!

56
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,829
Shut up.

57
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:50,251
<i>Yes, you've triggered
a read-me file voicemail.</i>

58
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,664
<i>And, no, you may not take me
off speakerphone.</i>

59
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:57,299
<i>You will not circumvent
or defeat this spell.</i>

60
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:00,671
<i>Whoever you are,
walk away. Now.</i>

61
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,515
<i>Or your death is as certain
as those I've enchanted.</i>

62
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:10,646
So, spells are basically
credit cards

63
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,815
with automated
fraud warning calls?

64
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:14,980
That's not super inspired.

65
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,319
Well, neither
is Henry Fogg,

66
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,523
nor his favorite students,
right?

67
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,368
Sit in the kitchen
until I tell you it's safe.

68
00:03:25,414 --> 00:03:26,530
You stay.

69
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,498
She scares me.

70
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,375
Yeah, well,
she's not the one with the Glock.

71
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:37,791
I've got a theory
about you, stud.

72
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,047
Stand close.

73
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:44,881
Ooh.

74
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,808
Oh, Henry.
Such a good try.

75
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,273
What are you doing?

76
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,605
Ow.

77
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,315
I'm making you useful.

78
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:04,529
Wait.

79
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,194
Where's Janet?

80
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,496
Hello?

81
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,157
Anyone?

82
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,334
Mother Nature,
can you hear me?

83
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,037
Wow, forests
don't even talk.

84
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:18,839
Whole psychotic break
just lacks imagination.

85
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,759
Again.

86
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,013
- Jesus.
- Dude.

87
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:35,265
The chips.

88
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,351
How am I doing this?

89
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:47,739
Yes.

90
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,247
This pond better be vodka.

91
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:25,781
Your Majesty?

92
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,407
Jesus Christ.

93
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:37,744
Forgive the suddenness
of my introduction.

94
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:41,172
I know you're not quite
yourself, King Margo.

95
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,291
What are you?

96
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:44,838
Where am I?

97
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:48,342
And why does everybody
in this nightmare keep calling me king?

98
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,009
Is that even a thing?

99
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,717
I'll endeavor
to explain.

100
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,022
Hello.

101
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:07,607
You're being kind of quiet.

102
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,740
Look, you're nice and all.

103
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,032
Sort of. But I... I could use
some intel on this place,

104
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,163
but how do I know
you're not a snitch?

105
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:21,124
Well, because like it or not,
I'm Santa.

106
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,966
Which used to mean I was once
considered fairly honest.

107
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,627
Reasonably reliable,
but I... I don't know.

108
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:28,798
Maybe, uh,

109
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,092
slightly admired.

110
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,340
Then all of a sudden
it was like, "Hey,

111
00:06:33,435 --> 00:06:36,223
"you break into houses once a year.
What's up with that?"

112
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,680
And, "Kids sit on your lap.

113
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,773
"How is that not creepy?"

114
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,150
Congratulations, Earth.

115
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,395
You ruined
the name of Santa.

116
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,731
So, you don't want
to hear from me?

117
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:50,900
Good.

118
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,613
'Cause I'm sure you don't need
this thing I could get you,

119
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:55,913
called magic.

120
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,287
How?

121
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:04,623
I am the Lord
of All Fillorian Fresh Water.

122
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,500
Which is a bit pretentious,

123
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:10,086
so, please,
call me Lord Fresh.

124
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,473
Assuming this is actually happening,
you pulled me down here.

125
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:15,809
Why?

126
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,476
Your birthright box.

127
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:20,309
You and my birth box
ain't happening,

128
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,264
so back up,
<i>Shape of Water.</i>

129
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:26,273
No, no.
Your birthright box.

130
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,945
- There.
- Oh.

131
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,449
Right.

132
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,990
No, Majesty!

133
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,944
If you touch it, it will harm you.

134
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:38,080
Even my protective wards
couldn't save you.

135
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,995
You know
about that spell shit?

136
00:07:40,752 --> 00:07:41,959
I'm really
somebody else,

137
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,662
and if I try to figure out who
shit clobbers me, burns me?

138
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,839
Correct.

139
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:48,507
Though, as I said,
you're safe down here.

140
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,501
Your birthright box,

141
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:52,757
which it has been
my honor to guard,

142
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,802
dictated your absence
from the kingdom,

143
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,679
your loss of self,

144
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:00,557
and your return
this day and hour.

145
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,725
But I must caution.

146
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,685
It also predicted

147
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,352
that you would learn
what it is

148
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,858
to live and rule alone.

149
00:08:10,115 --> 00:08:11,115
Yeah?

150
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,949
Well, alone's my jam,
<i>grenouille.</i>

151
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,952
And no matter what,
I rule.

152
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,457
Your enchantment
is most powerful.

153
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:28,331
I'm not sure that
my wards will hold.

154
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,754
To come back
and claim your destiny,

155
00:08:31,386 --> 00:08:33,969
you must find the god
who summoned you in the dream.

156
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,590
Please accept
my apologies.

157
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,802
I'm afraid I can't keep you
as safe as I had hoped.

158
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,028
Walk toward the mountains.

159
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:54,448
My destiny is to die of
pneumonia, isn't it?

160
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:55,820
You can tell me.

161
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,151
Hardly, Majesty.

162
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,616
Please return when
the spell is lifted.

163
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,656
Here's your lunch.

164
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,870
Ugh!

165
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,837
Well, if he's anything
like my Henry,

166
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,842
he keeps most of his secrets

167
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,220
in here.

168
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:28,933
Todd.

169
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,481
Oh, my God.

170
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,941
Hansel?

171
00:09:33,448 --> 00:09:35,189
- Hey.
- We gotta hustle.

172
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:37,201
Yeah, uh...

173
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,402
Anything I... I can do?

174
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:42,284
Yeah. Take your shirt off
and make me a sandwich.

175
00:09:48,338 --> 00:09:49,704
Sorry, but I'm starved.

176
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,298
If it helps, I'm vegan, so this sucks for me, too.

177
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,135
Todd? Jesus,
are you drunk?

178
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,775
Marina.

179
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:12,986
Hello, Henry.

180
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:15,529
What is this?
What did you do?

181
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,481
It's the same blue shit
you gave Hansel.

182
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,318
Only I knew you wouldn't
drink it at my request.

183
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,618
So, here's the deal.

184
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:23,286
Give yourself the antidote.

185
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,781
There is no antidote.

186
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,115
Bullshit.

187
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:27,329
Whoa, hoo, hoo, hoo!

188
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,292
So, it's true!

189
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,001
Everything she's been
telling us is true!

190
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:34,298
Us?

191
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:35,750
Who else
is involved in this?

192
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:39,758
Pretty much all of your apple-shining,
ass-kissing teacher's pets.

193
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:41,033
Oh, Christ.

194
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,175
Whatever she's saying she's going to do
to help you, she isn't.

195
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,122
And how are you talking
about this without...

196
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,478
Being attacked
by the world?

197
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:49,333
It's magic, remember?

198
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:50,643
What timeline
are you from?

199
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,440
The one where
you owe me child support.

200
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:57,021
I'm kidding.
So, the spell takes, what,

201
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,572
a day to kick in?

202
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,153
It's almost dawn.

203
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,488
You say
there's no antidote.

204
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,619
You better get
to a lab and get to it.

205
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,539
Because I'm not
turning you into a DJ.

206
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,415
No.

207
00:11:10,253 --> 00:11:11,994
You won't like
the new you.

208
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,998
Unless you have a secret dream
to live in a moving box.

209
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:21,546
You just hit the rethink button,
okay?

210
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,134
Let's go.

211
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,343
Bye.

212
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:29,936
Jesus.

213
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:32,890
Todd.

214
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:35,647
How long
have you been awake?

215
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,187
- We need to get you some help.
- No.

216
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,572
And what you just saw
dies with you.

217
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:41,658
Do you understand?

218
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,707
This cannot continue.

219
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:59,375
An infinity of pardons,
Acting High King Fen.

220
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,710
There is an urgent matter.

221
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,633
An urgent poacher?

222
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,013
Who claims
to be the High King.

223
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,206
So, an urgent,
insane poacher.

224
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,892
- Was my first thought.
- Until?

225
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,189
The name was uttered.

226
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,249
So,

227
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,534
you claim
to be High King

228
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,794
- Margo?
- No!

229
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,045
Ow!

230
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,798
- There you have it.
- So, every time you say...

231
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,717
Weird, huh?

232
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:49,471
You look
nothing like her.

233
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,641
Look.

234
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,934
I'm not saying
I'm who we are not talking about.

235
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,767
But I had this dream
where this goat god, Amber?

236
00:12:57,944 --> 00:12:58,980
- Ember.
- Ember.

237
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,436
Whatevs.

238
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,775
Said I had to get here
quick and dirty.

239
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:04,026
The reports are true.

240
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,907
Ember has indeed
returned to Fillory.

241
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,697
Miraculously risen
from the dead.

242
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,995
Look, if you know
where this Ember is...

243
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:11,367
We don't,
is the problem.

244
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,909
We don't want to find him.
We have to.

245
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,669
Something's happened
since his return.

246
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:22,291
Oh, I'm nodding
so you hurry

247
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:25,503
and you get to something
I actually understand.

248
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:26,972
Oh.

249
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:31,016
Our air has always
been graced

250
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:33,640
with what you
on Earth call opium.

251
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:36,055
But now it's saturated.

252
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,436
For some it's tolerable.

253
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,017
Some get quite giddy,

254
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:43,104
a few succumb to sleep
at the most inconvenient times,

255
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,189
and then there
are those who...

256
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:47,445
Dance. In the nude.

257
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,447
It sounds
lighthearted,

258
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,245
but it's actually resulted
in a number of deaths,

259
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,699
mainly in falling asleep
in the wrong place

260
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:55,999
at the wrong time.

261
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,452
Trampled in the middle of the road
being the most common.

262
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:02,415
However, a dance troupe
did die of exposure on a glacier,

263
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,794
though, by all accounts,
quite gracefully.

264
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,636
Magic is now rationed.

265
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,884
And none of it is powerful
enough to reverse this.

266
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,136
And since it coincides
with Ember's return...

267
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,844
His glorious resurrection
and divine rule!

268
00:14:15,438 --> 00:14:16,474
We hope.

269
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,769
We've come to believe
that this is his doing.

270
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,309
And perhaps
if he could be told

271
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,689
of the damage
it's causing,

272
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,772
he could be convinced
to reverse this.

273
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,356
Guys.

274
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,861
I need to stress

275
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,734
how much I don't give a shit.

276
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,204
Oh.

277
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,279
But he's dodging you

278
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,785
and he wants me.

279
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:38,083
So, let's find the fucker.

280
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,796
Sassy.

281
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,258
- Hi.
- Hi! Kim, sorry, I'm late.

282
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:48,345
No, this won't take long.

283
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,670
I think I'm flunking out.

284
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:51,300
Oh, first-year nerves,
totally normal.

285
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,474
No, no, no,
I am literally failing everything.

286
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,620
I mean, if I could
just pass one...

287
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:56,330
And somebody told you
I have a cheating spell.

288
00:14:56,354 --> 00:14:58,391
- Yes.
- Okay, I will hook you up but right now,

289
00:14:58,481 --> 00:14:59,562
I'm trying not to freak.

290
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:00,751
- What's wrong?
- I can't tell you.

291
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,016
- Okay.
- I promised.

292
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,817
- Right.
- Dean Fogg is leaving. Shit!

293
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,064
Why did I just say that?

294
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,190
Because it's too much.

295
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,758
Why do I have to be
the only one who knows?

296
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,444
Wait, he's leaving? Why?

297
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:11,491
Oh, believe me,
it is not his choice.

298
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:13,443
See, there's this Hedge Witch,
and she...

299
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:16,121
Dean Fogg, hi!
Sorry, I'm late.

300
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,060
I will give you
every cheating spell I have

301
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,478
if you please don't repeat this,
okay?

302
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:20,868
Great. Thanks.
It's gonna be fine.

303
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:22,749
Oh, my God,
this is horrible.

304
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:26,332
So, even after you're gone, nothing
about Marina can go in the memoir?

305
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:29,419
Write or breathe a single word
and there will be blood on your hands.

306
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,925
But the outstanding business
I'm attending to today

307
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,051
should be recorded
in minute detail.

308
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:35,595
Walter.

309
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,176
Walter.

310
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:40,600
You're the best drinking
companion I've ever had.

311
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,398
Thanks. I mean,
we only drank together twice.

312
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,271
I'm a high-functioning
alcoholic, Walter.

313
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,732
We prefer to do
our serious drinking alone.

314
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:50,030
So that when we weep,
we can wallow in self-loathing

315
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,277
without embarrassment.

316
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,928
- Did you get that, Todd?
- Fantastic.

317
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:53,952
Excellent.

318
00:15:54,245 --> 00:15:56,282
Walter, in my office bar

319
00:15:56,581 --> 00:16:00,541
is an unopened bottle
of 1977 Hollcroft single malt

320
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,039
that I was going to drink
if I ever committed suicide.

321
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,000
Enjoy, my dear friend.

322
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,226
It's not your fault
I'm always broke, Ashley.

323
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,216
I'm a degenerate gambler
who could use magic

324
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,589
to alter the outcome
of any game.

325
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,804
But then I couldn't relive
the secret shame I've held

326
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,176
since I was two years old.

327
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:18,304
What I crave most in the world
is the degradation of losing.

328
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,807
Thank you for every single
moment of that.

329
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:22,308
You're $56 short.

330
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,889
You're a cutthroat bookie.

331
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,067
Gold.

332
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,652
Magic has been a brutal
series of disappointments.

333
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:30,445
And after having lived
40 timelines,

334
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,194
39 of which range
from the comically horrendous

335
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:34,741
to the apocalyptically absurd,

336
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:36,652
to find it was
all for nothing...

337
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:41,452
Well, leaving this life
actually feels liberating.

338
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,622
- Hold this, Todd. Thank you.
- Okay.

339
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,749
Tell Jennifer thank you
and goodbye.

340
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,214
I had an affair
with his wife.

341
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,004
He behaved abominably.

342
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:58,716
Do you find all this
as cathartic as I do, Todd?

343
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,345
I think you really hurt him.

344
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:02,060
Well, back to my childhood.

345
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,478
I was raised
by my grandmother,

346
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,806
the kindest, wisest person
I've ever known.

347
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,127
Of course,
I could never tell her that

348
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,268
because all forms of intimacy
horrify me.

349
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:14,448
"All forms of intimacy
terrify the hell out of me."

350
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,702
Yes?

351
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,249
Kim. What can I
do for you?

352
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:27,248
Look, I'm pretty sure
I shouldn't tell you this.

353
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:30,122
Well, you probably shouldn't
have walked in and said that.

354
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,999
I don't think
that I belong here.

355
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,461
As I said,
it would take some time.

356
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,673
And, I promise, you do.

357
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:43,052
Right, and you're literally the only one
that thinks that, and you're leaving.

358
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:45,603
Todd.

359
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,147
Look, it's not his fault.
He's just upset.

360
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,069
I am, too.
Anybody that knew would be.

361
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:55,359
Please.

362
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,913
I probably
owe you an explanation.

363
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,867
My life is mostly
made up of regrets.

364
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,419
I'm not looking for
contradiction or pity.

365
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,498
It's just a fact
I'm suddenly forced to face.

366
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,299
But of all my many regrets

367
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,714
the greatest is something
I did very recently

368
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:20,013
to some of the most maddeningly
millennial students I ever had.

369
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,267
What...

370
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,890
Were they gonna hit us?

371
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:32,609
Advantage of being
the spell caster.

372
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,071
I'll never be able to correct
what I did to them.

373
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:38,782
But, Kim,
one day you might.

374
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:39,868
Me?

375
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:43,119
You have no idea
what you're capable of.

376
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:44,956
I do.

377
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,836
Okay, then if you want me
to help these students,

378
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,375
can you tell me who they are?

379
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:53,626
Their lives were
in grave danger.

380
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:58,009
I cast a spell that erased their identities
and gave them new ones,

381
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:01,259
and now that same spell
has been cast on me.

382
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:03,511
Jesus.

383
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:06,163
I mean, isn't there
anything you can do?

384
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:09,021
Well, if I reveal that
the spell can be reversed,

385
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:12,065
then someone would reverse
the spell on my students,

386
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,483
ensuring their deaths.

387
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,482
I will not allow
that to happen.

388
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,313
I have to do this.

389
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,527
I must accept this.

390
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,330
Hmm...

391
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,843
Ah, stubborn dude.

392
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:51,767
You got Plan B?

393
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,690
B plans are for losers.

394
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,062
Okay.

395
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,439
Uh... Well, whatever happens,
thank you for trying.

396
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:00,898
I don't really know

397
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:04,200
why you're putting yourself out
so much for us,

398
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:06,904
but it's pretty cool.

399
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:09,114
Well, it's pretty common
knowledge

400
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,040
that I'm a very,
very good person

401
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:12,618
who lives to help others.

402
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:16,423
Mmm.

403
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:19,420
Oh.

404
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,961
It's such a piece of shit.

405
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,388
Hey. I like the artwork.

406
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:26,969
Yep. Sure.

407
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:30,344
You have to admit,
the characters? Us?

408
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,137
We're pretty complex.

409
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:34,185
Oh, yeah, real complex.

410
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,901
Yeah, Isaac's big problem
is his dick is too big.

411
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:39,944
Hey. It can be a problem.

412
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,571
Seriously.

413
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,819
It narrows the field
by a lot more than you think.

414
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:47,820
I've been on way too many first dates
that end in urgent care, so...

415
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,279
- Gross.
- Look.

416
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:51,786
My life is pretty cool,

417
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:56,879
so, how do I know
this other me is gonna...

418
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,330
Nail as many groupies?

419
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,465
Whoa, hey, whoa, no.

420
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:04,716
That is not what Hansel
is about, okay?

421
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:08,469
You think there's a chance
the real you didn't bang your sister?

422
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:10,179
Hey, no, isn't that...

423
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,477
She was my stepsister, okay?

424
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:13,974
Stepsister.

425
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,771
And we didn't know till...
Till later.

426
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:16,894
Mmm.

427
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:18,479
Too many stepdads.

428
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,185
All right, well,
what about you?

429
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,737
- What's your kink?
- Me?

430
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:24,652
No, see, I'm perfect.

431
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,408
Yeah, I catch drug dealers,
murderers,

432
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:29,111
arsonists,
blackmailers, pimps.

433
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,954
I even stopped a girl from giving
herself a coat-hanger abortion

434
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,374
and got her to Planned Parenthood.
You see, I...

435
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,541
I'm a hero.

436
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,127
So, why would
you give that up?

437
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:38,420
You sound awesome.

438
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,455
I sound fake.

439
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,291
Which I am.

440
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,085
Oh, like your thunder meat.

441
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,591
All right, easy. It's...

442
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:49,385
It's... It's a meat.

443
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:51,929
I don't know
if it's thunder.

444
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,395
We just never know
where his celestial,

445
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:58,224
newly risen godliness
is going to pop up next.

446
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,141
From the brothel
in the Lower Meerskin,

447
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:04,480
Ember was then sighted on the schooner
of the thin white duke off Basher Island,

448
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,065
where there was a celebration
for three days and nights.

449
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,778
Okay. Well, so far, every sighting
he either gets the party started

450
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,284
or he dives right into one
that's already jumping off.

451
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,073
Ember has always
enjoyed his pleasures,

452
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,910
but this pace reeks
of self-destruction.

453
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,206
Please.

454
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,662
One July 4th,

455
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,214
I bet I could snort
my body weight in coke.

456
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,586
This dude's an amateur.

457
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,126
Next.

458
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:31,716
Landfall at Shimmering Cliff Palace,
then an orgy

459
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:33,683
at Sacred Sky Nunnery.

460
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,811
Okay.
That's almost impressive.

461
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,557
So, look, he's headed east.

462
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:43,189
If he keeps going,
what's the next hotspot?

463
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,020
The Hare on the Ass.

464
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,403
Seriously?

465
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:51,911
Whimsy.

466
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,028
I fucking hate it.

467
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:57,415
So, you found
a whole family of them, huh?

468
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:58,708
Mmm.

469
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,494
What happened
to the mother pig?

470
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:07,463
Kill it.

471
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:09,012
What?

472
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:12,093
Enyalius won't come
without a sacrifice, silly.

473
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:13,850
Here.

474
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,054
Slit its belly open, please.

475
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,889
Entrails on the altar.

476
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,481
No, I'm not, I'm not...

477
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:25,815
Look, I'm a person with a job
and a girlfriend and a life,

478
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,443
and I'm not your...
Your pal. Or your playmate.

479
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,524
And I'm not scared
of you anymore.

480
00:23:31,702 --> 00:23:34,365
So, why don't you
just fucking kill me?

481
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,905
I would never do that.

482
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,374
Ah!

483
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:52,220
Hello, Etta.

484
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,142
Oh, I suppose
this is why you summoned me.

485
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:02,604
Thank you.

486
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,644
Oh, and the answer is no.

487
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,776
Your new suit
is not finished yet.

488
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,194
Oh, pity.

489
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:10,606
You are usually
not this impatient.

490
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:13,950
Henry, would you like to see
the work in progress?

491
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:15,578
Oh, yes.

492
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:16,910
Okay.

493
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,168
Ah.

494
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,036
Beautiful.

495
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,042
Of course.

496
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:30,341
- Damn it.
- What in the world?

497
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:32,009
Magic ration.

498
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:34,838
My office had some
unexpected visitors today

499
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:36,844
who took a huge portion
of today's magic.

500
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:39,559
Ah. No worries.

501
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:42,975
Smell.

502
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,439
I'm sorry.

503
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,324
That's my grandmother's
huckleberry pie.

504
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:56,985
Wait, what?

505
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,116
What is it, Henry?

506
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,118
So, why a comic book?

507
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,412
Graphic novel, Etta.

508
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:11,587
Had a lot of characters
with detailed backstories.

509
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,085
And I could look at them.

510
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:16,088
So, the glamour
was much easier to cast.

511
00:25:16,557 --> 00:25:17,889
Doesn't matter now.

512
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,846
I'm about to live
a version of it.

513
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,519
Though, I'm assured,
one not quite as nice.

514
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,898
Well, you seem
awfully sanguine.

515
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,559
Fate's a fucker
that always wins.

516
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,858
Okay, I've known you for 22...

517
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,026
Well, 23 years now.

518
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:38,576
And I've loved you dearly
every moment.

519
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:41,746
Fully aware that you can barely
stand yourself.

520
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,915
And that made me sad,

521
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:48,794
but it also made you my best customer.

522
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:50,379
How so?

523
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:53,208
Isn't it obvious?

524
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:57,338
Come on, the bespoke suits,
the hand-sewn shirts...

525
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:01,842
It's armor.

526
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:05,144
It's an armor to keep
the world away.

527
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,726
A disguise so that nobody

528
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:10,938
can see what a truly
loving heart you have.

529
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:25,995
You said if revealed,
the spell can be reversed.

530
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:27,917
Kim. Don't.

531
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,006
I'm one of them,
aren't I?

532
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,136
You have to undo this
on all of us.

533
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:40,929
And then what?

534
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,177
And then we fight.

535
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,803
I know I can't stop you.

536
00:26:44,311 --> 00:26:48,055
But please,
be more careful now

537
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,730
than you've ever
been in your life.

538
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,021
Well, lives.

539
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:02,744
Finally getting
to be your teacher

540
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:08,328
has been an honor.

541
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:41,900
You're now the saddest loser
I ever buried.

542
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:43,613
Look.

543
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:55,542
Marina.

544
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:57,840
Hi, Dad.

545
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,727
How's it going?

546
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:22,906
Got it.

547
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:29,740
Do you feel it?

548
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:33,960
Stronger further up.

549
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:36,079
My arm wouldn't
even fit in there.

550
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:47,632
Go, little buddy.
Come on.

551
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:52,562
Come on, little buddy.

552
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:19,714
Hey. Hey, come on now.
Little narration.

553
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,256
Fuck off.

554
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,342
Come on, little buddy.

555
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:53,660
Yes?

556
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:58,495
I realize that.

557
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,329
But these dossiers
are private.

558
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:05,005
Holy shit.

559
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,191
Sorry, little buddy.

560
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,356
What happened?

561
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,357
What?

562
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:27,820
Did... Did anyone ever tell you
you're kind of withholding, you know?

563
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,531
Oh, come on. You're not trying
to kill yourself again, are you?

564
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:32,907
No.

565
00:30:35,876 --> 00:30:38,664
Hey, is all of that chimney
stuff about you true?

566
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,707
Never met one
I couldn't crack.

567
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,299
- Leg next?
- No, no, no, no, no.

568
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,847
Okay, I'm ready.
Whatever you want, okay?

569
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:55,347
Ah.

570
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,141
Oh.

571
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:02,892
Time to die.
Yes, it is.

572
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:04,485
Give me a little goodbye kiss.

573
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:05,988
Yes.

574
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,777
Explains a lot of weird shit,

575
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:17,581
but I promised I'd keep
everything about him private.

576
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:18,667
Okay.

577
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:21,536
Yeah, and I'm trying
to save him.

578
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,837
So, please.

579
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,050
How was that?
Was it good?

580
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,003
- Yeah.
- Can I have one?

581
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,925
Oh, yes. Of course.

582
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:33,718
Thank you.

583
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:41,598
Magic's supposed
to stay on till 11:00.

584
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:43,941
Spells take magic, right?

585
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,818
- Which is rationed.
- Which sucks.

586
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:51,073
And a spell like this would take even more
power than a normal one, right?

587
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,651
I mean, think about it.
It's six, seven, eight people?

588
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,862
Plus whole lives?

589
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:58,740
No. If you had any interruption
in the flow...

590
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,253
Wait. Magic's off.

591
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,545
It's him.

592
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,485
It's the spell. He told me that
it would try and kill us.

593
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:09,421
Right, but
without magic, how...

594
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,176
Shit.

595
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,762
Maybe he actually
finished it.

596
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:14,596
Finished what?

597
00:32:14,683 --> 00:32:16,424
This thing
he worked on for years.

598
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,260
A perpetual battery.

599
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,642
Come on.

600
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:27,856
Pray a little
harder, please.

601
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:35,864
Is that
suckling I smell?

602
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:38,363
Enyalius?

603
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,206
Well, fuck, yeah, it is.

604
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,741
You know what's funny?

605
00:32:42,252 --> 00:32:43,663
He sacrificed the pig.

606
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:44,998
He prayed.

607
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,663
And he's never heard of you.

608
00:32:54,723 --> 00:32:55,964
How dare you?

609
00:33:03,732 --> 00:33:05,018
I want it back.

610
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:07,896
Give it to me.

611
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,649
Well, I have no idea
what "it" is,

612
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:15,817
but I grant you permission to search
my ball sack with your tongue.

613
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,110
Fine.

614
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:19,870
I'll just take it.

615
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,991
Okay, so,

616
00:34:02,666 --> 00:34:05,454
remember, Fogg said be really,
really careful.

617
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:06,544
Because...

618
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,042
Oh, my God. Kim?

619
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:12,294
Kim.

620
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:15,301
No, no.

621
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,469
No, no, no.

622
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:21,515
Yeah, I need a medic.

623
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,051
Yeah, I think she's...

624
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,392
Sorry, prank.

625
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:31,900
Kim. Are you okay?

626
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,945
Fine.

627
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:37,281
No, see.

628
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,366
You kind of

629
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,114
died.

630
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,866
Well, maybe being un-killable
is my discipline.

631
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:49,494
Yeah, that's not a thing.

632
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,340
Hey.

633
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,300
How much juice
do you think this thing has?

634
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:58,252
Well, it's perpetual.

635
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,216
So,

636
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,593
it can be overloaded.

637
00:35:02,684 --> 00:35:04,892
I have no idea.

638
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:08,138
Oh, shit!

639
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,147
How is this a good idea?

640
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:31,126
Oh, God.

641
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,253
It's not in there!

642
00:35:36,593 --> 00:35:39,176
You're not Enyalius,
are you?

643
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,841
You're his servant.

644
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:45,262
A Corybant.
Aren't you?

645
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,723
All right, look, he's...
He's not who you want, so just...

646
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,184
You know, let him go.

647
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:52,566
All right?

648
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:58,195
Why did your master
send you to trick me?

649
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,151
He knows.

650
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,966
It's not even midday.

651
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,097
Real ragers rave in the day.

652
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,568
Horn guy. Is that him?

653
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:47,994
Who is that?

654
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:49,662
An imposter.

655
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,490
No wonder he won't see
anyone who knows him.

656
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,870
Hey. Ember.

657
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:56,878
I'm here.

658
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,207
Yeah, you are.

659
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:00,795
Congrats.

660
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:05,679
Where are your hooves?

661
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:43,963
Todd!

662
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:27,594
Quentin. You're back.

663
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:37,271
Oh.

664
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,848
You wanted to play.

665
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,609
Sorry. He's too dead.

666
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:49,529
Cool trick. Do it again.

667
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:17,853
Okay, what the what now?

668
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:20,973
What the fuck are you
doing here, Bacchus?

669
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:23,309
All right.

670
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:24,735
Have we banged?

671
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,565
I followed you on Instagram.

672
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:28,568
Everybody did
till they kicked you off.

673
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:31,116
Oh, I know, right? Dicks.

674
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:32,405
Well,

675
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,327
that explains
all the opium in the air.

676
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:35,621
Nice touch, I like it.

677
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:37,159
It's pretty sweet, right?

678
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:39,577
Mmm-hmm. All right, all right.
What are you doing here?

679
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,230
Why do you want everyone
thinking you're Ember?

680
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:44,338
Hey, so, you really want
to go back to Earth, right?

681
00:39:44,424 --> 00:39:46,416
No, I want you
to answer my fucking question.

682
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:47,716
Thanks for popping in.

683
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:52,179
Where is our High King?

684
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,551
Who are you?

685
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,424
A god

686
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:57,719
is all you need to know.

687
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,651
I'm glad
you're back, Quentin.

688
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:11,031
I was getting a little tired
of the Brian game.

689
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,827
Yeah. Me, too.

690
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:24,830
So, maybe I missed something
when we were playing,

691
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:29,004
but you had to
torture him to death.

692
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:32,545
Why, again?

693
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:36,011
Gods are so tricky.

694
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:37,842
Right.

695
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:41,687
But what about the one
that you were after today?

696
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:44,307
Oh, we'll get him.

697
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,397
And I'll get back
what he took from me.

698
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:49,315
And then the others.

699
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:50,608
They all took.

700
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,485
Took what, exactly?

701
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,279
See, that's what
I don't really know.

702
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:57,865
They took
this part of me

703
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,998
that knew things.

704
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,079
It's not fair.

705
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,036
No, yeah, totally.

706
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:08,960
They owe you.

707
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:11,959
Got it.

708
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,380
You really understand me,
Quentin.

709
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,305
It's good to have
a friend like you.

710
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:27,520
You know,
speaking of friends,

711
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:31,904
when you get back
what the gods took from you,

712
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,733
maybe...

713
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:39,786
Could I maybe
have Eliot back?

714
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,703
The one who
tried to kill me?

715
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,497
Hey, hey, no. No.
That was a mistake.

716
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:49,000
You were there.
Do you

717
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,383
like him more than me?

718
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,468
No, I... I didn't say that.

719
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:56,929
You miss him.

720
00:41:57,974 --> 00:42:01,138
You... You miss
all your friends.

721
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,593
The...

722
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:05,771
The ones in my castle
who tried to kill me.

723
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:12,732
Good.

724
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:18,783
Huh.

725
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:21,453
Well, upsides and downsides.

726
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,850
Yeah, no,
I remember everything.

727
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,161
Kind of like a dream.

728
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:28,039
I was gonna say
acid trip myself.

729
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,585
Oh, my God.

730
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,180
<i>Mis hermanos.</i>

731
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,595
Where were you? We...
We looked everywhere.

732
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,301
- Stay back.
- Why?

733
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,224
Because I'm not here to play.
