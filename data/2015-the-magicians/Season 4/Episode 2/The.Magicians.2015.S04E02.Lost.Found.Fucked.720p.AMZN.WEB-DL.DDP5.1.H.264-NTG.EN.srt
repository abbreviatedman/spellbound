1
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:08,501
Previously on "The Magicians."

2
00:00:08,512 --> 00:00:10,281
Alice is fine. Depressed.

3
00:00:10,793 --> 00:00:11,593
Surly.

4
00:00:12,447 --> 00:00:13,247
Still asking to see you again.

5
00:00:14,057 --> 00:00:14,857
She's fixated on the thing

6
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:16,598
she says she saw in the Castle.

7
00:00:17,278 --> 00:00:18,496
She's worried about her friends.

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,847
I can't think of anyone
better protected than they.

9
00:00:21,891 --> 00:00:25,112
They must stay where they are
as they are.

10
00:00:25,155 --> 00:00:26,591
They'll be fine.

11
00:00:26,635 --> 00:00:30,204
Your spellwork was
was masterful.

12
00:00:36,427 --> 00:00:37,820
There's something
you need to know

13
00:00:37,863 --> 00:00:39,778
and as soon as I start
telling you about this,

14
00:00:39,822 --> 00:00:42,390
bad shit is gonna start
flying at our heads.

15
00:00:45,262 --> 00:00:47,569
So how do we figure out
who we really are?

16
00:00:47,612 --> 00:00:49,397
Hi. I'm Marina.

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,789
I'm here to help.

18
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:54,097
So you're like
some powerful, benevolent

19
00:00:54,141 --> 00:00:55,316
White Witch?

20
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:56,447
Uh-huh.

21
00:00:56,491 --> 00:00:58,754
Let's take a peek underneath

22
00:00:58,797 --> 00:01:00,408
and see what you
really look like.

23
00:01:03,585 --> 00:01:05,108
Fix it.

24
00:01:05,152 --> 00:01:07,632
I don't know what
you want me to fix!

25
00:01:07,676 --> 00:01:09,591
Whatever the matter is
in Fillory!

26
00:01:09,634 --> 00:01:11,767
Hello?

27
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,682
Hello?!

28
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,217
Old.

29
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:30,438
Things get old so fast,
don't they?

30
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:32,266
Sorry, but where are we?

31
00:01:32,309 --> 00:01:34,181
I told you, Greece.

32
00:01:34,224 --> 00:01:35,791
Right, right.

33
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:38,837
This is the temple of the god
we are summoning.

34
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:40,361
Enyalius.

35
00:01:40,404 --> 00:01:41,840
God of war.

36
00:01:42,841 --> 00:01:44,495
Thought that was Ares.

37
00:01:46,845 --> 00:01:48,804
Say that when you see him.

38
00:01:48,847 --> 00:01:50,719
It makes him so mad.

39
00:01:51,676 --> 00:01:53,809
So okay. Go in the woods.

40
00:01:53,852 --> 00:01:55,463
Get a pig.

41
00:01:55,506 --> 00:01:56,464
Excuse me?

42
00:01:56,507 --> 00:01:57,465
A wild pig.

43
00:01:57,508 --> 00:01:58,988
The younger the better.

44
00:01:59,031 --> 00:02:00,294
Sorry, I don't mean
to be difficult,

45
00:02:00,337 --> 00:02:02,644
but couldn't you
just conjure one?

46
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:05,560
Hmm, no.

47
00:02:05,603 --> 00:02:07,736
It has to be caught
with human hands

48
00:02:07,779 --> 00:02:10,521
and stained with human effort.

49
00:02:10,565 --> 00:02:11,914
You know, that, that stuff

50
00:02:11,957 --> 00:02:13,611
that comes out of your skin.

51
00:02:14,873 --> 00:02:16,310
Sweat?

52
00:02:16,353 --> 00:02:17,528
Hurry.

53
00:02:20,923 --> 00:02:22,490
What the fuck did you do?

54
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:23,795
I didn't do anything.

55
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:25,754
That spell's a cunt with fangs.

56
00:02:25,797 --> 00:02:28,365
I thought your amulet
was supposed to protect us.

57
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:31,020
It did. You're alive
and welcome, asshole.

58
00:02:31,063 --> 00:02:34,676
Well, great, that didn't work
and we're back to square one.

59
00:02:40,638 --> 00:02:42,336
Yeah?
Hello,

60
00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:43,815
whoever you are.

61
00:02:43,859 --> 00:02:46,862
Do not tamper
with my enchantment.

62
00:02:46,905 --> 00:02:48,690
Holy shit,
it's James Earl Jones!

63
00:02:48,733 --> 00:02:51,562
Shut. Up.

64
00:02:51,606 --> 00:02:55,349
Yes, you've triggered
a read-me file voicemail.

65
00:02:55,392 --> 00:02:59,440
And no, you may not take me
off speaker phone.

66
00:02:59,483 --> 00:03:02,399
You will not circumvent
or defeat this spell.

67
00:03:02,443 --> 00:03:05,794
Whoever you are, walk away.
Now.

68
00:03:05,837 --> 00:03:09,580
Or your death is as certain
as those I've enchanted.

69
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,759
So spells are basically
credit cards

70
00:03:14,803 --> 00:03:17,545
with automated
fraud warning calls?

71
00:03:17,588 --> 00:03:20,330
That's not super inspired.

72
00:03:20,374 --> 00:03:22,767
Well, neither is Henry Fogg.

73
00:03:22,811 --> 00:03:25,509
You are his favorite students,
right?

74
00:03:26,423 --> 00:03:28,077
Sit in the kitchen

75
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,731
until I tell you it's safe.

76
00:03:29,774 --> 00:03:31,559
You stay.

77
00:03:36,781 --> 00:03:38,479
She scares me.

78
00:03:38,522 --> 00:03:40,350
Yeah, well, she's not
the one with the Glock.

79
00:03:40,394 --> 00:03:42,918
I've got a theory
about you, stud.

80
00:03:43,962 --> 00:03:45,921
Stand close.

81
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:49,707
Ooh.

82
00:03:58,629 --> 00:04:00,936
Oh, Henry.
Such a good try.

83
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:03,373
What are you doing?

84
00:04:03,417 --> 00:04:05,506
Ow.

85
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:08,030
I'm making you useful.

86
00:04:08,073 --> 00:04:09,640
Wait.

87
00:04:09,684 --> 00:04:10,989
Where's Janet?

88
00:04:13,122 --> 00:04:14,515
Hello?

89
00:04:14,558 --> 00:04:15,820
Anyone?

90
00:04:15,864 --> 00:04:18,432
Mother Nature, can you hear me?

91
00:04:18,475 --> 00:04:20,869
Wow, forests don't even talk.

92
00:04:20,912 --> 00:04:24,438
Whole psychotic break
just lacks imagination.

93
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,404
Again.

94
00:04:36,928 --> 00:04:38,887
- Jesus.
- Dude.

95
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:39,888
The chips.

96
00:04:39,931 --> 00:04:43,457
How am I doing this?

97
00:04:51,421 --> 00:04:52,727
Yes.

98
00:04:53,858 --> 00:04:56,513
This pond better be vodka.

99
00:05:29,546 --> 00:05:30,765
Your Majesty?

100
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:35,726
Jesus fuck.

101
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:42,559
Forgive the suddenness
of my introduction.

102
00:05:42,603 --> 00:05:46,694
I know you're not
quite yourself, King Margo.

103
00:05:46,737 --> 00:05:48,522
What are you?

104
00:05:48,565 --> 00:05:49,784
Where am I?

105
00:05:49,827 --> 00:05:51,829
And why does everybody
in this nightmare

106
00:05:51,873 --> 00:05:53,135
keep calling me king?

107
00:05:53,178 --> 00:05:55,137
Is that even a thing?

108
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,835
I'll endeavor to explain.

109
00:06:09,543 --> 00:06:10,892
Hello.

110
00:06:10,935 --> 00:06:13,068
You're being kind of quiet.

111
00:06:16,114 --> 00:06:18,203
Look, you're nice and all.

112
00:06:18,247 --> 00:06:20,858
Sort of. But I could use
some intel on this place

113
00:06:20,902 --> 00:06:22,991
but how do I know
you're not a snitch?

114
00:06:23,034 --> 00:06:24,558
Well, because

115
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:26,647
like it or not, I'm Santa.

116
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,867
Which used to mean I was once
considered fairly honest.

117
00:06:29,911 --> 00:06:32,609
Reasonably reliable,
but I, I don't know.

118
00:06:32,653 --> 00:06:34,132
Maybe, uh...

119
00:06:34,176 --> 00:06:36,047
slightly admired.

120
00:06:36,091 --> 00:06:38,136
Then all of the sudden
everyone's like, "Hey.

121
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,096
You break into houses once
a year. What's up with that?"

122
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:43,794
And, uh, "Kids sit on your lap.

123
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:45,796
How is that not creepy?"

124
00:06:46,623 --> 00:06:48,016
Congratulations, Earth.

125
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:50,801
You ruined the name of Santa.

126
00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:54,109
So you don't want
to hear from me?

127
00:06:54,152 --> 00:06:56,111
Good.

128
00:06:56,154 --> 00:06:57,591
'Cause I'm sure you don't need

129
00:06:57,634 --> 00:06:59,157
this thing I could get you.

130
00:06:59,201 --> 00:07:00,985
Called magic.

131
00:07:02,987 --> 00:07:04,032
How?

132
00:07:05,816 --> 00:07:09,733
I am the Lord of All
Fillorian Fresh Water.

133
00:07:09,777 --> 00:07:11,996
Which is a bit pretentious,

134
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,217
so, please, call me Lord Fresh.

135
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,872
Assuming this
is actually happening,

136
00:07:17,915 --> 00:07:19,569
you pulled me down here.

137
00:07:19,613 --> 00:07:20,744
Why?

138
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:22,572
Your birthright box.

139
00:07:22,616 --> 00:07:24,008
You and my birth box

140
00:07:24,052 --> 00:07:25,140
ain't happening

141
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,055
so back up, "Shape of Water."

142
00:07:27,098 --> 00:07:31,625
No, no.
Your birthright box.

143
00:07:31,668 --> 00:07:32,887
There.

144
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:33,888
Oh.

145
00:07:33,931 --> 00:07:34,889
Right.

146
00:07:34,932 --> 00:07:37,282
No, Majesty!

147
00:07:37,326 --> 00:07:40,285
If you touch it,
it will harm you.

148
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:43,158
Even my protective wards
couldn't save you.

149
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:45,552
You know about that spell shit?

150
00:07:45,595 --> 00:07:46,857
I'm really somebody else,

151
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:48,163
and if I try to figure out who

152
00:07:48,206 --> 00:07:49,251
shit clobbers me, burns me?

153
00:07:49,294 --> 00:07:50,687
Correct.

154
00:07:50,731 --> 00:07:53,342
Though, as I said,
you're safe down here.

155
00:07:53,385 --> 00:07:55,170
Your birthright box,

156
00:07:55,213 --> 00:07:57,694
which it has been
my honor to guard,

157
00:07:57,738 --> 00:08:00,654
dictated your absence
from the kingdom,

158
00:08:00,697 --> 00:08:03,700
your loss of self,
and your return

159
00:08:03,744 --> 00:08:05,659
this day and hour.

160
00:08:05,702 --> 00:08:07,748
But I must caution.

161
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,880
It also predicted

162
00:08:09,924 --> 00:08:11,926
that you would learn what it is

163
00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:14,798
to live and rule alone.

164
00:08:14,842 --> 00:08:19,281
Yeah? Well, alone's my jam,
grenouille.

165
00:08:19,324 --> 00:08:21,892
And no matter what, I rule.

166
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:30,858
Your enchantment
is most powerful.

167
00:08:30,901 --> 00:08:33,208
I'm not sure that my wards
will hold.

168
00:08:33,251 --> 00:08:35,689
To come back and claim
your destiny,

169
00:08:35,732 --> 00:08:38,953
you must find the god
who summoned you in the dream.

170
00:08:40,258 --> 00:08:42,347
Please accept my apologies.

171
00:08:42,391 --> 00:08:45,916
I'm afraid I can't keep you
as safe as I had hoped.

172
00:08:55,056 --> 00:08:56,927
Walk toward the mountains.

173
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:59,408
My destiny is to die
of pneumonia, isn't it?

174
00:08:59,451 --> 00:09:00,670
You can tell me.

175
00:09:00,714 --> 00:09:02,280
Hardly, Majesty.

176
00:09:02,324 --> 00:09:05,022
Please return
when the spell is lifted.

177
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:06,763
Here's your lunch.

178
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:07,764
Ugh!

179
00:09:18,645 --> 00:09:20,734
Well, if he did anything
like my Henry,

180
00:09:20,777 --> 00:09:22,910
he keeps most of his secrets...

181
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:25,347
in here.

182
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:34,922
Todd.

183
00:09:34,965 --> 00:09:36,271
Oh, my God.

184
00:09:36,314 --> 00:09:38,055
Hansel?

185
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:40,275
- Hey.
- We gotta hustle.

186
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,756
Yeah, uh...

187
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,105
anything I can do?

188
00:09:44,148 --> 00:09:45,759
Yeah. Take your shirt off

189
00:09:45,802 --> 00:09:47,369
and make me a sandwich.

190
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:54,768
Sorry, but I'm starved.

191
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:56,030
If it helps, I'm vegan,

192
00:09:56,073 --> 00:09:57,074
so this sucks for me too.

193
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:06,388
Todd? Jesus, are you drunk?

194
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:16,746
Marina.

195
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,792
Hello, Henry.

196
00:10:18,835 --> 00:10:20,315
What is this?
What did you do?

197
00:10:20,358 --> 00:10:22,360
It's the same blue shit
you gave Hansel.

198
00:10:22,404 --> 00:10:25,102
Only I knew you wouldn't
drink it at my request.

199
00:10:25,146 --> 00:10:27,104
So here's the deal.

200
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:28,149
Give yourself the antidote.

201
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:29,716
There is no antidote.

202
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,717
Bullshit.

203
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,240
Whoa, hoo, hoo, hoo!

204
00:10:32,283 --> 00:10:34,372
So it's true!

205
00:10:35,417 --> 00:10:37,941
Everything she's been
telling us is true!

206
00:10:37,985 --> 00:10:39,116
Us?

207
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,727
Who else is involved in this?

208
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,077
Pretty much all
of your apple-shining,

209
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,426
ass-kissing teacher's pets.

210
00:10:44,469 --> 00:10:45,427
Christ.

211
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,907
Whatever she's saying she's

212
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:49,126
going to do to help you,
she isn't.

213
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,867
And how are you talking
about this without...

214
00:10:50,911 --> 00:10:52,695
Being attacked by the world?

215
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:54,044
It's magic, remember?

216
00:10:54,088 --> 00:10:55,480
What timeline are you from?

217
00:10:55,524 --> 00:10:57,395
The one where you owe me
child support.

218
00:10:59,093 --> 00:11:00,094
I'm kidding.

219
00:11:00,137 --> 00:11:01,878
So the spell takes what,

220
00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:03,924
a day to kick in?

221
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:05,534
It's almost dawn.

222
00:11:05,577 --> 00:11:07,492
You say there's no antidote.

223
00:11:07,536 --> 00:11:09,451
You better get to a lab
and get to it.

224
00:11:09,494 --> 00:11:12,889
Because I'm not turning you
into a DJ.

225
00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:14,935
No.

226
00:11:14,978 --> 00:11:16,893
You won't like the new you.

227
00:11:18,242 --> 00:11:20,984
Unless you have a secret dream
to live in a moving box.

228
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:26,294
You just hit the rethink
button, okay?

229
00:11:29,906 --> 00:11:30,864
Let's go.

230
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:31,952
Bye.

231
00:11:33,344 --> 00:11:34,998
Jesus.

232
00:11:36,217 --> 00:11:37,827
Todd.

233
00:11:39,046 --> 00:11:40,743
How long have you been awake?

234
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:42,353
We need to get you some help.

235
00:11:42,397 --> 00:11:45,400
No. And what you just saw
dies with you.

236
00:11:45,443 --> 00:11:46,749
Do you understand?

237
00:11:57,934 --> 00:11:59,022
This cannot continue.

238
00:12:00,197 --> 00:12:01,721
An infinity of pardons,

239
00:12:01,764 --> 00:12:04,071
Acting High King Fen.

240
00:12:04,114 --> 00:12:06,029
There is an urgent matter.

241
00:12:10,425 --> 00:12:11,687
An urgent poacher?

242
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,167
Who claims to be the High King.

243
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,516
So an urgent, insane poacher.

244
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:16,039
- Was my first thought.
- Until?

245
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:18,520
The name... was uttered.

246
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,189
So.

247
00:12:35,232 --> 00:12:38,192
You claim to be High King...

248
00:12:38,235 --> 00:12:39,193
Margo?

249
00:12:39,236 --> 00:12:40,281
No!

250
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:45,808
Ow!

251
00:12:45,852 --> 00:12:46,853
There you have it.

252
00:12:46,896 --> 00:12:47,854
So every time you say...

253
00:12:49,377 --> 00:12:51,118
Weird, huh?

254
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:53,511
You look nothing like... her.

255
00:12:53,555 --> 00:12:55,209
Look.

256
00:12:55,252 --> 00:12:58,865
I'm not saying I'm
who we are not talking about.

257
00:12:58,908 --> 00:13:01,824
But I had this dream where
this goat god, Amber?

258
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:03,217
Ember.

259
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,827
Whatevs.

260
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:06,568
Said I had to get here
quick and dirty.

261
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:08,396
The reports are true.

262
00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:10,180
Ember has indeed
returned to Fillory.

263
00:13:10,224 --> 00:13:11,747
Miraculously risen
from the dead.

264
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,141
Look. If you know
where this Ember is...

265
00:13:14,184 --> 00:13:15,751
We don't, is the problem.

266
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,668
We don't want to find him.
We have to.

267
00:13:19,711 --> 00:13:21,844
Something's happened
since his return.

268
00:13:23,715 --> 00:13:26,414
Oh, I'm nodding so you hurry

269
00:13:26,457 --> 00:13:29,852
and you get to something
I actually understand.

270
00:13:29,896 --> 00:13:31,636
Oh.

271
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,421
Our air

272
00:13:33,464 --> 00:13:35,249
has always been graced

273
00:13:35,292 --> 00:13:37,120
with what you on Earth call

274
00:13:37,164 --> 00:13:38,600
opium.

275
00:13:38,643 --> 00:13:40,428
But now it's saturated.

276
00:13:40,471 --> 00:13:42,560
For some it's tolerable.

277
00:13:42,604 --> 00:13:44,388
Some get quite giddy,

278
00:13:44,432 --> 00:13:47,217
a few succumb to sleep
at the most inconvenient times,

279
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:49,393
and then there are those who...

280
00:13:49,437 --> 00:13:50,568
Dance.

281
00:13:50,612 --> 00:13:51,656
In the nude.

282
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,571
It sounds lighthearted,

283
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:56,270
but it's actually resulted
in a number of deaths,

284
00:13:56,313 --> 00:13:58,663
mainly in falling asleep
in the wrong place

285
00:13:58,707 --> 00:13:59,926
at the wrong time.

286
00:13:59,969 --> 00:14:01,275
Trampled in the middle
of the road

287
00:14:01,318 --> 00:14:02,711
being the most common.

288
00:14:02,754 --> 00:14:05,757
Uh, however, a dancer
did die of exposure

289
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:07,585
on a glacier, though, uh,

290
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:10,153
by all accounts,
quite gracefully.

291
00:14:10,197 --> 00:14:12,155
Magic is now rationed.

292
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:13,896
And none of it is powerful
enough to reverse this.

293
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,464
And since it coincides
with Ember's return...

294
00:14:16,507 --> 00:14:18,945
His glorious resurrection
and divine rule!

295
00:14:18,988 --> 00:14:21,512
We hope.

296
00:14:21,556 --> 00:14:22,644
We've come to believe

297
00:14:22,687 --> 00:14:23,906
that this is his doing.

298
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:26,430
And perhaps if he could be told

299
00:14:26,474 --> 00:14:27,736
of the damage it's causing,

300
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:30,217
he could be convinced
to reverse this.

301
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,479
Guys.

302
00:14:31,522 --> 00:14:33,220
I need to stress

303
00:14:33,263 --> 00:14:35,439
how much I don't give a shit.

304
00:14:35,483 --> 00:14:36,832
Oh.

305
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,399
But he's dodging you

306
00:14:38,442 --> 00:14:40,488
and he wants me.

307
00:14:40,531 --> 00:14:42,490
So let's find the fucker.

308
00:14:45,797 --> 00:14:47,234
Sassy.

309
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,280
- Hi.
- Hi!

310
00:14:50,324 --> 00:14:51,325
Kim, sorry, I'm late.

311
00:14:51,368 --> 00:14:52,413
No, this won't take long.

312
00:14:52,456 --> 00:14:53,849
I think I'm flunking out.

313
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,633
Oh, first year nerves,
totally normal.

314
00:14:55,677 --> 00:14:56,939
No, no, no, I am literally
failing everything.

315
00:14:56,983 --> 00:14:58,636
I mean, if I could
just pass one...

316
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,681
And somebody told you
I have a cheating spell.

317
00:14:59,724 --> 00:15:01,204
Yes.

318
00:15:01,248 --> 00:15:02,205
Okay, I will hook you up
right now.

319
00:15:02,249 --> 00:15:03,554
I'm trying not to freak.

320
00:15:03,598 --> 00:15:04,686
- What's wrong?
- I can't tell you.

321
00:15:04,729 --> 00:15:05,948
- Okay.
- I promised.

322
00:15:05,992 --> 00:15:07,689
- Right.
- Dean Fogg is leaving. Shit!

323
00:15:07,732 --> 00:15:08,690
Why did I just say that?

324
00:15:08,733 --> 00:15:10,344
Because it's too much.

325
00:15:10,387 --> 00:15:11,693
Why do I have to be
the only one who knows?

326
00:15:11,736 --> 00:15:13,825
Wait, he's leaving?
Why?

327
00:15:13,869 --> 00:15:15,653
Oh, believe me,
it is not his choice.

328
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:17,525
See, there's this
Hedge Witch, and she...

329
00:15:17,568 --> 00:15:20,223
Dean Fogg, hi!
Sorry I'm late.

330
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:21,964
I will give you every
cheating spell I have

331
00:15:22,008 --> 00:15:23,400
if you please don't
repeat this, okay?

332
00:15:23,444 --> 00:15:24,967
Great. Thanks.
It's gonna be fine.

333
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:26,795
Oh, my God, this is horrible.

334
00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:28,492
So even after you're gone,

335
00:15:28,536 --> 00:15:30,364
nothing about Marina
can go in the memoir?

336
00:15:30,407 --> 00:15:31,713
Write or breathe a single word

337
00:15:31,756 --> 00:15:33,497
and there will be blood
on your hands.

338
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,978
But the outstanding business
I'm attending to today

339
00:15:36,022 --> 00:15:38,589
should be recorded
in minute detail.

340
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:39,721
Walter.

341
00:15:39,764 --> 00:15:41,375
Walter.

342
00:15:41,418 --> 00:15:44,247
You're the best drinking
companion I've ever had.

343
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,640
Thanks.

344
00:15:45,683 --> 00:15:47,381
I mean, we only drank
together twice.

345
00:15:47,424 --> 00:15:49,513
I'm a high-functioning
alcoholic, Walter.

346
00:15:49,557 --> 00:15:51,863
We prefer to do
our serious drinking alone.

347
00:15:51,907 --> 00:15:54,388
So that when we weep,
we can wallow in self-loathing

348
00:15:54,431 --> 00:15:55,389
without embarrassment.

349
00:15:55,432 --> 00:15:56,564
Did you get that, Todd?

350
00:15:56,607 --> 00:15:58,305
- Fantastic.
- Excellent.

351
00:15:58,348 --> 00:16:00,524
Walter, in my office bar

352
00:16:00,568 --> 00:16:04,572
is an unopened bottle
of 1977 Hollcroft single malt

353
00:16:04,615 --> 00:16:07,879
that I was going to drink
if I ever committed suicide.

354
00:16:07,923 --> 00:16:10,534
Enjoy, my dear friend.

355
00:16:10,578 --> 00:16:12,449
It's not your fault
I'm always broke, Ashley.

356
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:14,364
I'm a degenerate gambler
who can use magic

357
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:15,757
to alter the outcome
of any game.

358
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,541
But then I couldn't relive
the secret shame

359
00:16:17,585 --> 00:16:19,065
I've held since I was
two years old.

360
00:16:19,108 --> 00:16:20,631
What I crave most in the world

361
00:16:20,675 --> 00:16:22,938
is the degradation of losing.

362
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,940
Thank you for every single
moment of that.

363
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,376
You're $56 short.

364
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,944
You're a cutthroat bookie.

365
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,598
Gold.

366
00:16:30,641 --> 00:16:32,817
Magic has been a brutal
series of disappointments.

367
00:16:32,861 --> 00:16:34,689
And after having
lived 40 timelines,

368
00:16:34,732 --> 00:16:37,431
39 of which range
from the comically horrendous

369
00:16:37,474 --> 00:16:38,867
to the apocalyptically absurd,

370
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:42,479
to find it was all
for nothing, well...

371
00:16:42,523 --> 00:16:46,701
leaving this life
actually feels liberating.

372
00:16:46,744 --> 00:16:49,356
Hold this, Todd. Thank you.
Okay.

373
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:55,014
Tell Jennifer thank you
and goodbye.

374
00:16:56,798 --> 00:16:58,452
I had an affair with his wife.

375
00:16:58,495 --> 00:17:00,497
He behaved abominably.

376
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,847
Do you find all this
as cathartic as I do, Todd?

377
00:17:02,891 --> 00:17:04,588
I think you really hurt him.

378
00:17:04,632 --> 00:17:05,981
Well, back to my childhood.

379
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,722
I was raised by my grandmother,

380
00:17:07,765 --> 00:17:09,593
the kindest, wisest person
I've ever known.

381
00:17:09,637 --> 00:17:11,030
Of course I could never
tell her that

382
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:13,597
because all forms
of intimacy horrify me.

383
00:17:14,555 --> 00:17:18,646
"All forms of intimacy
terrify the hell out of me."

384
00:17:19,864 --> 00:17:21,779
Yes?

385
00:17:25,957 --> 00:17:28,873
Kim. What can I do for you?

386
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:31,528
Look, I'm pretty sure
I shouldn't tell you this.

387
00:17:31,572 --> 00:17:34,488
Well, you probably shouldn't
have walked in and said that.

388
00:17:34,531 --> 00:17:37,099
I don't think
that I belong here.

389
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:39,841
As I said,
it would take some time.

390
00:17:39,884 --> 00:17:43,062
And, I promise, you do.

391
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:45,151
Right, and you're literally
the only one

392
00:17:45,194 --> 00:17:47,370
that thinks that,
and you're leaving.

393
00:17:48,632 --> 00:17:49,720
Todd.

394
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:53,550
Look, it's not his fault.

395
00:17:54,421 --> 00:17:55,221
He's just upset.
I am too.

396
00:17:55,378 --> 00:17:56,553
Anybody that knew would be.

397
00:17:56,597 --> 00:17:57,946
Please.

398
00:18:03,473 --> 00:18:07,347
I probably owe you
an explanation.

399
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,697
My life is mostly made up
of regrets.

400
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,134
I'm not looking
for contradiction or pity.

401
00:18:12,178 --> 00:18:15,181
It's just a fact
I'm suddenly forced to face.

402
00:18:15,224 --> 00:18:17,183
But of all my many regrets

403
00:18:17,226 --> 00:18:19,402
the greatest is something
I did very recently

404
00:18:19,446 --> 00:18:21,578
to some of the most maddeningly
millennial students

405
00:18:21,622 --> 00:18:22,971
I ever had.

406
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:31,110
What...

407
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:32,546
Were they gonna hit us?

408
00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:36,071
Advantage of being
the spell caster.

409
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,118
I'll never be able to correct
what I did to them.

410
00:18:39,161 --> 00:18:40,467
But Kim,

411
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,511
one day you might.

412
00:18:41,555 --> 00:18:42,512
Me?

413
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:44,471
You have no idea

414
00:18:44,514 --> 00:18:46,299
what you're capable of.

415
00:18:46,342 --> 00:18:47,648
I do.

416
00:18:48,736 --> 00:18:50,433
Okay, then if you want me
to help these students

417
00:18:50,477 --> 00:18:52,261
can you tell me who they are?

418
00:18:54,045 --> 00:18:56,787
Their lives
were in grave danger.

419
00:18:56,831 --> 00:18:59,268
I cast a spell that erased
their identities

420
00:18:59,312 --> 00:19:00,704
and gave them new ones,

421
00:19:00,748 --> 00:19:04,186
and now that same spell
has been cast on me.

422
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,232
Jesus.

423
00:19:07,276 --> 00:19:09,017
I mean, isn't there
anything you can do?

424
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,585
Well, if I reveal that
the spell can be reversed,

425
00:19:11,628 --> 00:19:14,588
then someone would reverse
the spell on my students,

426
00:19:14,631 --> 00:19:16,590
ensuring their deaths.

427
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,419
I will not allow that to happen.

428
00:19:19,462 --> 00:19:21,203
I have to do this.

429
00:19:21,247 --> 00:19:23,379
I must accept this.

430
00:19:49,536 --> 00:19:51,712
Ah, stubborn dude.

431
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:55,063
You got Plan B?

432
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:56,586
B plans are for losers.

433
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,587
Okay.

434
00:19:57,631 --> 00:19:59,110
Uh, well, whatever happens,

435
00:19:59,154 --> 00:20:00,242
thank you for trying.

436
00:20:02,157 --> 00:20:04,246
I don't really know why

437
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:08,076
you're putting yourself out
so much for us, but...

438
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:09,817
it's pretty cool.

439
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,732
Well, it's pretty
common knowledge

440
00:20:11,775 --> 00:20:13,690
that I'm a very,
very good person

441
00:20:13,734 --> 00:20:15,518
who lives to help others.

442
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,609
Mm.

443
00:20:19,653 --> 00:20:22,308
Oh.

444
00:20:23,657 --> 00:20:26,137
It's such a piece of shit.

445
00:20:26,181 --> 00:20:28,531
Hey. I like the artwork.

446
00:20:28,575 --> 00:20:30,359
Yep. Sure.

447
00:20:30,403 --> 00:20:33,406
You have to admit,
the characters? Us?

448
00:20:33,449 --> 00:20:34,755
We're pretty complex.

449
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:37,236
Oh, yeah, real complex.

450
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:40,456
Yeah, Isaac's big problem
is his dick is too big.

451
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,806
Hey. It can be a problem.

452
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,112
Seriously.

453
00:20:44,155 --> 00:20:45,156
It narrows the field

454
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,376
by a lot more than you think.

455
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,725
I've been on way
too many first dates

456
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:50,553
that end in urgent care, so...

457
00:20:50,597 --> 00:20:51,859
- Gross.
- Look.

458
00:20:51,902 --> 00:20:56,385
My life is pretty cool, so...

459
00:20:56,429 --> 00:20:58,344
how do I know this other me

460
00:20:58,387 --> 00:20:59,432
is gonna...

461
00:20:59,475 --> 00:21:00,781
Nail as many groupies?

462
00:21:00,824 --> 00:21:03,262
Whoa, hey, whoa, no.

463
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:07,353
That is not what Hansel
is about, okay?

464
00:21:07,396 --> 00:21:09,529
You know there's a chance
the real you

465
00:21:09,572 --> 00:21:11,357
didn't bang your sister?

466
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,749
Hey, no, that's...

467
00:21:12,793 --> 00:21:15,274
she was my step sister, okay?

468
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:16,623
Step sister.

469
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,451
And we didn't know
till, till later.

470
00:21:18,494 --> 00:21:19,756
Mm.

471
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,280
Too many stepdads.

472
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:22,803
All right, well, what about you?

473
00:21:22,846 --> 00:21:24,370
What's your kink?

474
00:21:24,413 --> 00:21:25,849
Me?

475
00:21:25,893 --> 00:21:27,547
No, see, I'm perfect.

476
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,810
Yeah, I catch drug dealers,
murderers,

477
00:21:29,853 --> 00:21:31,725
arsonists, blackmailers, pimps.

478
00:21:31,768 --> 00:21:33,596
I even stopped a girl
from giving herself

479
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,555
a coat-hanger abortion and
got her to Planned Parenthood.

480
00:21:35,598 --> 00:21:37,296
You see, I...

481
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:38,427
I'm a hero.

482
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:39,689
So why would you give that up?

483
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:41,212
You sound awesome.

484
00:21:41,256 --> 00:21:44,215
I sound fake.

485
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:46,653
Which I am.

486
00:21:46,696 --> 00:21:47,741
Oh, like your thunder meat.

487
00:21:47,784 --> 00:21:49,569
All right, easy.

488
00:21:49,612 --> 00:21:52,223
It's... it's a meat.

489
00:21:52,267 --> 00:21:54,791
I don't know if it's thunder.

490
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,273
We just never know
where his celestial,

491
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,797
newly-risen godliness
is going to pop up next.

492
00:22:00,841 --> 00:22:02,843
From the brothel
in the Lower Meerskin,

493
00:22:02,886 --> 00:22:04,540
Ember was then sighted
on the schooner

494
00:22:04,584 --> 00:22:06,977
of the thin white duke
off Basher Island,

495
00:22:07,021 --> 00:22:09,415
where there was a celebration
for three days and nights.

496
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:10,416
Okay.

497
00:22:10,459 --> 00:22:11,939
Well, so far, every sighting

498
00:22:11,982 --> 00:22:13,288
he either gets the party started

499
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,594
or he dives right into one

500
00:22:14,637 --> 00:22:16,204
that's already jumping off.

501
00:22:16,247 --> 00:22:17,727
Ember has always
enjoyed his pleasures,

502
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:20,687
but this pace reeks
of self-destruction.

503
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:21,775
Please.

504
00:22:21,818 --> 00:22:23,342
One July 4th,

505
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:25,822
I bet I could snort
my bodyweight in coke.

506
00:22:25,866 --> 00:22:27,389
This dude's an amateur.

507
00:22:27,433 --> 00:22:28,695
Next.

508
00:22:29,739 --> 00:22:31,959
Landfall at
Shimmering Cliff Palace,

509
00:22:32,002 --> 00:22:34,875
then an... orgy

510
00:22:34,918 --> 00:22:36,920
at Sacred Sky Nunnery.

511
00:22:36,964 --> 00:22:39,662
Okay. That's almost
impressive.

512
00:22:40,707 --> 00:22:43,231
So look, he's headed east.

513
00:22:43,274 --> 00:22:46,452
If he keeps going,
what's the next hotspot?

514
00:22:46,495 --> 00:22:47,670
The Hare on the Ass.

515
00:22:47,714 --> 00:22:49,368
Seriously?

516
00:22:53,459 --> 00:22:54,590
Whimsy.

517
00:22:54,634 --> 00:22:56,723
I fucking hate it.

518
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,335
So you found a whole
family of them, huh?

519
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,858
Mm.

520
00:23:01,902 --> 00:23:04,383
What happened to the mother pig?

521
00:23:08,996 --> 00:23:10,693
Kill it.

522
00:23:10,737 --> 00:23:11,694
What?

523
00:23:11,738 --> 00:23:12,869
Enyalius won't come

524
00:23:12,913 --> 00:23:15,394
without a sacrifice, silly.

525
00:23:15,437 --> 00:23:16,612
Here.

526
00:23:16,656 --> 00:23:18,701
Slit its belly open, please.

527
00:23:18,745 --> 00:23:20,529
Entrails on the altar.

528
00:23:21,922 --> 00:23:24,794
No, I'm not, I'm not...

529
00:23:24,838 --> 00:23:26,840
Look, I'm a person with a job

530
00:23:26,883 --> 00:23:28,537
and a girlfriend and a life,

531
00:23:28,581 --> 00:23:32,280
and I'm not your, your pal.
Or your playmate.

532
00:23:32,323 --> 00:23:34,413
And I'm not scared of you
anymore.

533
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:37,894
So why don't you
just fucking kill me?

534
00:23:37,938 --> 00:23:39,766
I would never do that.

535
00:23:42,072 --> 00:23:43,944
Ah!

536
00:23:53,388 --> 00:23:55,390
Hello, Etta.

537
00:23:58,524 --> 00:24:00,830
Oh, I suppose this is why
you summoned me.

538
00:24:04,007 --> 00:24:05,574
Thank you.

539
00:24:05,618 --> 00:24:07,446
Oh, and the answer is no.

540
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:09,317
Your new suit
is not finished yet.

541
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,101
Oh, pity.

542
00:24:11,145 --> 00:24:13,669
You are usually
not this impatient.

543
00:24:13,713 --> 00:24:16,933
Henry, would you like to see
the work in progress?

544
00:24:16,977 --> 00:24:17,934
Oh, yes.

545
00:24:17,978 --> 00:24:19,588
Okay.

546
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,464
Ah.

547
00:24:25,507 --> 00:24:26,726
Beautiful.

548
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:28,858
Of course.

549
00:24:30,991 --> 00:24:33,036
Damn it.
What in the world?

550
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,690
Magic ration.

551
00:24:34,734 --> 00:24:37,519
My office had some
unexpected visitors today

552
00:24:37,563 --> 00:24:39,608
who took a huge portion
of today's magic.

553
00:24:39,652 --> 00:24:42,350
Ah.
No worries.

554
00:24:44,352 --> 00:24:45,788
Smell.

555
00:24:53,622 --> 00:24:55,406
I'm sorry.

556
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:58,453
That's my grandmother's
huckleberry pie.

557
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:00,107
Wait, what?

558
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,848
What is it, Henry?

559
00:25:05,895 --> 00:25:08,028
So why a comic book?

560
00:25:08,071 --> 00:25:10,509
Graphic novel, Etta.

561
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:14,513
Had a lot of characters
with detailed backstories.

562
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:15,775
And I could look at them.

563
00:25:15,818 --> 00:25:18,995
So the glamour was
much easier to cast.

564
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,128
Doesn't matter now.

565
00:25:21,171 --> 00:25:23,522
I'm about to live
a version of it.

566
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:26,437
Though, I'm assured,
one not quite as nice.

567
00:25:26,481 --> 00:25:29,658
Well, you seem awfully sanguine.

568
00:25:29,702 --> 00:25:32,531
Fate's a fucker
that always wins.

569
00:25:32,574 --> 00:25:34,837
Okay, I've known you for 22...

570
00:25:34,881 --> 00:25:38,580
well... 23 years now.

571
00:25:38,624 --> 00:25:41,757
And I've loved you dearly
every moment.

572
00:25:41,801 --> 00:25:45,195
Fully aware that you can barely
stand yourself.

573
00:25:45,239 --> 00:25:48,503
And that made me sad, but...

574
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,593
it also made you
my best customer.

575
00:25:51,637 --> 00:25:53,073
How so?

576
00:25:54,117 --> 00:25:56,163
Isn't it obvious?

577
00:25:56,206 --> 00:25:58,034
Come on, the bespoke suits,

578
00:25:58,078 --> 00:26:00,471
the hand-sewn shirts...

579
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:05,085
It's armor.

580
00:26:05,128 --> 00:26:08,131
It's an armor
to keep the world away.

581
00:26:08,175 --> 00:26:10,612
A disguise so that nobody

582
00:26:10,656 --> 00:26:13,615
can see what a truly
loving heart you have.

583
00:26:25,975 --> 00:26:28,587
You said if revealed
the spell can be reversed.

584
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:29,588
Kim.

585
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:30,937
Don't.

586
00:26:35,028 --> 00:26:36,899
I'm one of them, aren't I?

587
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:42,557
You have to undo this
on all of us.

588
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:43,645
And then what?

589
00:26:43,689 --> 00:26:44,907
And then we fight.

590
00:26:44,951 --> 00:26:46,692
I know I can't stop you.

591
00:26:46,735 --> 00:26:50,217
But please, be more careful now

592
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,654
than you've ever been
in your life.

593
00:26:52,698 --> 00:26:54,830
Well, lives.

594
00:27:03,056 --> 00:27:05,536
Finally getting to be
your teacher...

595
00:27:09,497 --> 00:27:11,499
Has been an honor.

596
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:44,880
You're now the saddest loser
I ever buried.

597
00:27:44,924 --> 00:27:46,142
Look.

598
00:27:56,936 --> 00:27:58,111
Marina.

599
00:27:59,112 --> 00:28:00,853
Hi, Dad.

600
00:28:19,132 --> 00:28:19,932
How's it going?

601
00:28:23,745 --> 00:28:25,573
Got it.

602
00:28:30,578 --> 00:28:32,188
Do you feel it?

603
00:28:34,582 --> 00:28:36,279
Stronger further up.

604
00:28:36,323 --> 00:28:38,586
My arm wouldn't even
fit in there.

605
00:28:48,248 --> 00:28:49,771
Go, little buddy.
Come on.

606
00:28:53,427 --> 00:28:55,124
Come on, little buddy.

607
00:29:19,627 --> 00:29:21,107
Hey. Hey, come on now.

608
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,108
Little narration.

609
00:29:22,151 --> 00:29:23,849
Fuck off.

610
00:29:23,892 --> 00:29:25,676
Come on, little buddy.

611
00:29:54,531 --> 00:29:55,881
Yes?

612
00:29:59,232 --> 00:30:00,799
I realize that.

613
00:30:00,842 --> 00:30:02,801
But these dossiers are private.

614
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,327
Holy shit.

615
00:30:21,863 --> 00:30:23,473
Sorry, little buddy.

616
00:30:23,517 --> 00:30:24,779
What happened?

617
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,433
What?

618
00:30:26,476 --> 00:30:27,826
Did, did anyone ever tell you

619
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:30,219
you're kind of withholding,
you know?

620
00:30:30,263 --> 00:30:31,742
Oh, come on.

621
00:30:31,786 --> 00:30:33,570
You're not trying to
kill yourself again, are you?

622
00:30:33,614 --> 00:30:34,876
No.

623
00:30:38,358 --> 00:30:40,839
Hey, is all of that chimney
stuff about you true?

624
00:30:40,882 --> 00:30:43,276
Never met one I couldn't crack.

625
00:30:48,629 --> 00:30:51,501
- Leg next?
- No, no, no, no, no.

626
00:30:51,545 --> 00:30:54,243
Okay, I'm ready.
Whatever you want, okay?

627
00:30:56,463 --> 00:30:58,247
Ah.

628
00:30:59,727 --> 00:31:00,902
Oh.

629
00:31:02,904 --> 00:31:04,906
Time to die.
Yes it is.

630
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,865
Give me a little goodbye kiss.

631
00:31:06,908 --> 00:31:08,344
Yes.

632
00:31:12,609 --> 00:31:15,743
Explains a lot
of weird shit, but...

633
00:31:15,786 --> 00:31:19,703
I promised I'd keep everything
about him private.

634
00:31:19,747 --> 00:31:23,882
Okay. Yeah, and I'm trying
to save him.

635
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:25,579
So please.

636
00:31:28,756 --> 00:31:30,714
How was that?
Was it good?

637
00:31:30,758 --> 00:31:32,020
- Yeah.
- Can I have one?

638
00:31:32,064 --> 00:31:34,675
Oh, yes.
Of course.

639
00:31:34,718 --> 00:31:36,372
Thank you.

640
00:31:40,463 --> 00:31:44,467
Magic's supposed to
stay on till 11:00.

641
00:31:44,511 --> 00:31:46,643
Spells take magic, right?

642
00:31:46,687 --> 00:31:48,994
Which is rationed.
Which sucks.

643
00:31:49,037 --> 00:31:51,648
And a spell like this would
take even more power

644
00:31:51,692 --> 00:31:53,041
than a normal one, right?

645
00:31:53,085 --> 00:31:56,262
I mean, six, seven,
eight people?

646
00:31:56,305 --> 00:31:58,264
Plus whole lives?

647
00:31:58,307 --> 00:32:01,484
No. If you had any
interruption in the flow...

648
00:32:04,009 --> 00:32:06,054
Wait. Magic's off.

649
00:32:06,098 --> 00:32:07,055
It's him.

650
00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:08,535
It's the spell.

651
00:32:08,578 --> 00:32:09,840
He told me that it would
try and kill us.

652
00:32:09,884 --> 00:32:12,060
Right, but without magic, how...

653
00:32:12,104 --> 00:32:13,583
Shit.

654
00:32:13,627 --> 00:32:14,976
Maybe he actually finished it.

655
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,543
Finished what?

656
00:32:16,586 --> 00:32:19,546
This thing he worked on
for years.

657
00:32:19,589 --> 00:32:21,765
A perpetual battery.

658
00:32:23,985 --> 00:32:24,986
Come on.

659
00:32:28,642 --> 00:32:30,383
Pray a little harder, please.

660
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:38,391
Is that suckling I smell?

661
00:32:39,305 --> 00:32:40,784
Enyalius?

662
00:32:40,828 --> 00:32:42,612
Well, fuck yeah it is.

663
00:32:42,656 --> 00:32:44,310
You know what's funny?

664
00:32:44,353 --> 00:32:45,876
He sacrificed the pig.

665
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,400
He prayed.

666
00:32:47,443 --> 00:32:48,967
And he's never heard of you.

667
00:32:56,844 --> 00:32:58,846
How dare you?

668
00:33:05,505 --> 00:33:08,551
I want it back.

669
00:33:08,595 --> 00:33:10,075
Give it to me.

670
00:33:10,118 --> 00:33:13,861
Well, I have no idea
what "it" is

671
00:33:13,904 --> 00:33:15,384
but I grant you permission

672
00:33:15,428 --> 00:33:17,996
to search my ball sack
with your tongue.

673
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:20,520
Fine.

674
00:33:20,563 --> 00:33:23,044
I'll just take it.

675
00:34:02,475 --> 00:34:04,607
Okay, so.

676
00:34:04,651 --> 00:34:06,957
Remember, Fogg said be
really, really careful.

677
00:34:07,001 --> 00:34:08,133
Because...

678
00:34:11,484 --> 00:34:12,441
Oh, my God.

679
00:34:12,485 --> 00:34:13,442
Kim?

680
00:34:13,486 --> 00:34:14,530
Kim.

681
00:34:16,663 --> 00:34:17,881
No, no.

682
00:34:17,925 --> 00:34:19,840
No, no, no.

683
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:23,713
Yeah, I need a medic.

684
00:34:23,757 --> 00:34:24,801
Yeah, I think she's...

685
00:34:27,717 --> 00:34:30,416
Sorry, prank.

686
00:34:31,982 --> 00:34:34,463
Kim. Are you okay?

687
00:34:35,812 --> 00:34:37,727
Fine.

688
00:34:37,771 --> 00:34:39,773
No, see.

689
00:34:39,816 --> 00:34:41,775
You kind of...

690
00:34:41,818 --> 00:34:42,906
died.

691
00:34:45,779 --> 00:34:48,434
Well, maybe being un-killable
is my discipline.

692
00:34:49,304 --> 00:34:51,306
Yeah, that's not a thing.

693
00:34:53,961 --> 00:34:55,963
Hey.

694
00:34:56,006 --> 00:34:58,096
How much juice do you think
this thing has?

695
00:34:58,139 --> 00:35:00,576
Well, it's perpetual.

696
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,578
So...

697
00:35:02,622 --> 00:35:04,363
it can be overloaded.

698
00:35:04,406 --> 00:35:07,061
I have no idea.

699
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,108
Oh, shit!

700
00:35:10,151 --> 00:35:12,022
How is this a good idea?

701
00:35:31,259 --> 00:35:32,260
Oh, God.

702
00:35:33,305 --> 00:35:35,133
It's not in there!

703
00:35:37,526 --> 00:35:41,139
You're not Enyalius, are you?

704
00:35:41,182 --> 00:35:44,011
You're his servant.

705
00:35:44,054 --> 00:35:47,362
A corybant.
Aren't you?

706
00:35:47,406 --> 00:35:50,148
All right, look, he's,
he's not who you want.

707
00:35:50,191 --> 00:35:51,366
So just...

708
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,063
You know, let him go.

709
00:35:53,107 --> 00:35:55,283
All right?

710
00:35:57,067 --> 00:36:00,027
Why did your master
send you to trick me?

711
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:02,072
He knows.

712
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:28,664
It's not even mid-day.

713
00:36:28,708 --> 00:36:31,101
Real ragers rave in the day.

714
00:36:36,803 --> 00:36:39,414
Horn guy.
Is that him?

715
00:36:48,467 --> 00:36:49,729
Who is that?

716
00:36:49,772 --> 00:36:51,209
An imposter.

717
00:36:51,252 --> 00:36:52,210
No wonder he won't see

718
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:53,298
anyone who knows him.

719
00:36:53,341 --> 00:36:54,734
Hey. Ember.

720
00:36:57,302 --> 00:36:59,217
I'm here.

721
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,219
Yeah, you are.

722
00:37:01,262 --> 00:37:02,829
Congrats.

723
00:37:05,397 --> 00:37:07,703
Where are your hooves?

724
00:37:44,392 --> 00:37:45,437
Todd.

725
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,394
Quentin. You're back.

726
00:38:37,489 --> 00:38:39,360
Oh.

727
00:38:39,404 --> 00:38:42,276
You wanted to play.

728
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,452
Sorry. He's too dead.

729
00:38:47,934 --> 00:38:50,110
Cool trick. Do it again.

730
00:39:16,136 --> 00:39:18,399
Okay, what the what now?

731
00:39:18,443 --> 00:39:21,881
What the fuck are you
doing here, Bacchus?

732
00:39:21,924 --> 00:39:23,622
All right.

733
00:39:23,665 --> 00:39:25,101
Have we banged?

734
00:39:25,145 --> 00:39:26,973
I followed you on Instagram.

735
00:39:27,016 --> 00:39:28,975
Everybody did
till they kicked you off.

736
00:39:29,018 --> 00:39:31,238
Oh, I know, right? Dicks.

737
00:39:31,281 --> 00:39:32,631
Well.

738
00:39:32,674 --> 00:39:34,502
That explains all the opium
in the air.

739
00:39:34,546 --> 00:39:36,156
Nice touch, I like it.

740
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:37,287
It's pretty sweet, right?

741
00:39:37,331 --> 00:39:38,288
Mm-hmm, all right, all right.

742
00:39:38,332 --> 00:39:39,899
What are you doing here?

743
00:39:39,942 --> 00:39:41,422
Why do you want everyone
thinking you're Ember?

744
00:39:41,466 --> 00:39:44,860
Hey, so, you really want
to go back to Earth, right?

745
00:39:44,904 --> 00:39:47,036
No, I want you to answer
my fucking question.

746
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,124
Thanks for popping in.

747
00:39:51,214 --> 00:39:52,433
Where is our High King?

748
00:39:52,477 --> 00:39:54,261
Who are you?

749
00:39:54,304 --> 00:39:55,654
A god

750
00:39:55,697 --> 00:39:58,396
is all you need to know.

751
00:40:05,098 --> 00:40:07,143
I'm glad you're back, Quentin.

752
00:40:08,362 --> 00:40:11,409
I was getting a little tired
of the Brian game.

753
00:40:12,932 --> 00:40:15,413
Yeah, me too.

754
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:25,379
So maybe I missed something
when we were playing, but...

755
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:29,557
you had to torture him to death.

756
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:33,518
Why, again?

757
00:40:33,561 --> 00:40:37,173
Gods are so tricky.

758
00:40:37,217 --> 00:40:38,697
Right.

759
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:42,962
But what about the one
that you were after today?

760
00:40:43,005 --> 00:40:45,486
Oh, we'll get him.

761
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:48,054
And I'll get back
what he took from me.

762
00:40:48,097 --> 00:40:49,621
And then the others.

763
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:51,013
They all took.

764
00:40:51,057 --> 00:40:53,407
Took what, exactly?

765
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,540
See, that's what I
don't really know.

766
00:40:55,583 --> 00:40:58,934
They took this part of me

767
00:40:58,978 --> 00:41:01,459
that knew things.

768
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,592
It's not fair.

769
00:41:04,636 --> 00:41:06,594
No, yeah, totally.

770
00:41:07,595 --> 00:41:09,292
They owe you.

771
00:41:11,033 --> 00:41:12,295
Got it.

772
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:17,039
You really understand me,
Quentin.

773
00:41:19,128 --> 00:41:21,435
It's good to have a friend
like you.

774
00:41:26,266 --> 00:41:27,963
You know, speaking of friends,

775
00:41:28,007 --> 00:41:30,270
when you get back

776
00:41:30,313 --> 00:41:32,446
what the gods took from you...

777
00:41:34,666 --> 00:41:37,103
maybe...

778
00:41:37,146 --> 00:41:40,236
could I maybe have Eliot back?

779
00:41:42,282 --> 00:41:44,240
The one who tried to kill me?

780
00:41:44,284 --> 00:41:47,026
Hey, hey, no. No.
That was a mistake.

781
00:41:47,069 --> 00:41:49,507
You were there.
You...

782
00:41:51,334 --> 00:41:53,598
like him more than me?

783
00:41:53,641 --> 00:41:55,730
No, I, I didn't say that.

784
00:41:55,774 --> 00:41:58,080
You miss him.

785
00:41:58,124 --> 00:42:01,475
You... you miss
all your friends.

786
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,739
The... the ones in my castle

787
00:42:04,783 --> 00:42:06,262
who tried to kill me.

788
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:13,139
Good.

789
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,101
Huh.

790
00:42:19,145 --> 00:42:22,322
Well, upsides and downsides.

791
00:42:22,365 --> 00:42:24,019
Yeah, no, I remember everything.

792
00:42:24,063 --> 00:42:26,108
Kind of like a dream.

793
00:42:26,152 --> 00:42:28,720
I was gonna say
acid trip myself.

794
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,250
Oh, my God.

795
00:42:39,208 --> 00:42:40,688
Mis hermanos.

796
00:42:40,732 --> 00:42:43,125
Where were you?
We looked everywhere.

797
00:42:43,169 --> 00:42:44,779
- Stay back.
- Why?

798
00:42:49,479 --> 00:42:52,395
Because I'm not here to play.
