blow anything up,

00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:02,277
And you, your mother, and I,

181
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:03,759
we were the ones
that made the beacon,

182
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:06,150
so, a part of her
came to each of us.

183
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:10,149
So, what do you want?

184
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,749
The nearest pipe junction box.

185
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,488
Why would I ever...
After Modesto...

186
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:16,290
Because you want your daughter.

187
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,425
Look, we are trying to stop
what's happening out here.

188
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,197
More magic will
lower the body count,

189
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:27,331
or this situation you created
blows up into a full-on war.

190
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:29,433
You put more out
there for anyone...

191
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,341
Hedges have always self-policed.

192
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:35,675
I consider it my
full-time responsibility.

193
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:37,081
You have my word.

194
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:40,911
Your proposal is very risky.

195
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,853
So is putting Harriet
back together.

196
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:46,354
But I can do it. Can you?

197
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:48,337
I can fix her. (CELL
PHONE CHIMES)

198
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,556
If you give Kady the box.

199
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:52,985
ZELDA: Fine, we have a deal.

200
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,232
A moment? It's urgent. Sorry.

201
00:08:57,337 --> 00:09:00,068
We'll give you a moment.
Alice, walk with me.

202
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:01,173
A few details.

203
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,739
An entire safe house?

204
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:05,844
In 10 minutes,

205
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:08,746
everybody was infected.
Half of them are dead.

206
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:11,147
We have to find that
guy in that stupid mask.

207
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,210
Now. Okay, start some locators.

208
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:19,053
Casting spells in the current
socio-political climate is...

209
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:21,060
I much prefer
option 'B', which is,

210
00:09:21,161 --> 00:09:22,493
this guy gets Reed's Mark

211
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,997
and waits until this
mushroom cloud dissipates.

212
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,397
You can't be serious.

213
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:28,630
I can't believe you're not.

214
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:29,759
I got your back,

215
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:33,499
but I would prefer to do that
in one solid non-crispy piece.

216
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,832
Give me a day.

217
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:42,544
(SOFTLY) That's hot,
that's hot, that's hot.

218
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,885
So, we're looking
for what, exactly?

219
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:46,952
Any reference

220
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,750
to the annoyingly vague
message the dragon sent me.

221
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:51,085
"Seek the Binder."

222
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:52,191
I hate riddles.

223
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,886
But if it could jumper
cable her, then...

224
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,055
In "D&D", a Binder's,
like, a low class level of...

225
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,291
Announcement. Damn it.

226
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:02,460
The stone from your dragon
person is 100% god piece.

227
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:05,266
That is good news.

228
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,272
No.

229
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,364
The good news is

230
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,502
I can feel how many
pieces are still missing.

231
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:13,569
Any guesses?

232
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,845
The answer is one.

233
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,385
Only Enyalius stands between

234
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,944
me and anatomical perfection.

235
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,989
Find him and bring
me the final piece.

236
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:27,926
Cheesy puffs?

237
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,295
Um...

238
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:39,829
I guess we switch
tracks to find Enyalius.

239
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:41,805
It's not gonna be easy.
He knows we're looking.

240
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,777
A lot of gods kind of
have signatures. Um...

241
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:47,473
Ways to look for them,
whether they mean to or not.

242
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:48,571
So, we research and,

243
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,947
while we're there, we
solve this Binder shit.

244
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:54,650
Are we taking our snacky friend?

245
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:56,155
Since I have no other way

246
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,418
to motivate you
than this meat sack,

247
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,289
know if you take too long,

248
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,125
I'm going ice cave climbing

249
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:04,425
with no clothes,

250
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,331
until this body freezes forever.

251
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:15,300
MARGO: <i>Stop changing
the subject. The Napster?</i>

252
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:16,375
It's odd.

253
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:20,174
Not only is the Great Snow
100 years early, when it sings,

254
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,280
it's in soprano.

255
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,347
Fascinating.

256
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:23,781
Can you tell me
what the cat lady

257
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,546
said about my destiny lizard?

258
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:29,817
Well, the message
was very unclear.

259
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:32,017
You were mind
melding for 12 hours.

260
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,993
Uh, she's very
mercurial. Josh, hello!

261
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:36,290
JOSH: Hi.

262
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,362
Glad you're back.

263
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:40,365
Talking points up the
waz. Here's number one.

264
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,059
Eliot! Alive.

265
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:44,966
What? JOSH: Yeah.

266
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,439
Q sent a troop of
these cuties to exposit.

267
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,873
Eliot's alive, albeit
in mind-prison,

268
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:51,672
while The Monster
controls the joystick.

269
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,644
Talking point <i>dos.</i> Thank you.

270
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,911
A wild Fillorian clock
tree has sprouted up,

271
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:59,849
leaving a village stuck in time.

272
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,854
It's been a total
clockster fuck.

273
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:03,587
(CHUCKLES)

274
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,716
No? Nothing?

275
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:09,159
Okay, anyway, with the
ambient being so low,

276
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,706
that's the latest on the
magical weirdness list,

277
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,730
which is getting long.

278
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,959
We should call the Council.
Step ahead of you, sister.

279
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,660
In my official capacity

280
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,761
as pinch-hitter and
fill-in crown-wearer,

281
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,532
I planned a state dinner.

282
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:21,700
Nothing brings
peeps closer together

283
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:24,403
to solve a global
catastrophe like good eats.

284
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,207
Margo, you're gonna
wanna see the guest list.

285
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,078
Q is positive he's
alive in there?

286
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:30,172
Yeah.

287
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,218
(BOTH MOANING)

288
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:34,479
Aww.

289
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,588
Oh. Oh!

290
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:41,420
I'll just

291
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,086
go now.

292
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:47,457
(BOTH SIGH)

293
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:49,134
That was the most...

294
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:52,069
Thorough sex I've ever had.

295
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,572
So, I'll see you
when I get back.

296
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,633
Uh, uh. But the
royals are arriving.

297
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:59,110
And I have to go
save Eliot. How?

298
00:12:59,212 --> 00:13:02,114
Or, is the idea to
be a friend by dying?

299
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:05,048
Uh-huh. Don't make
a sorry dumb gesture.

300
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,087
Will you just
stay for the feast?

301
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,416
I invited the Foremost.

302
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:09,888
Foremost what?

303
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,652
He leads a nomadic tribe that,

304
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:13,386
according to my apricot guy

305
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,325
who's tight with
their agave trader,

306
00:13:15,428 --> 00:13:16,521
was once ravaged

307
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,461
by body-possessing
demonic spirits.

308
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:19,564
And?

309
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:23,592
And in act three of the movie,
the Foremost saved them

310
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,798
with special weapons
that expel possession.

311
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,465
You're shitting me.

312
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,941
Nope, that's the one
thing we didn't just do.

313
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,307
They call them ice axes,

314
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:33,004
and I'm assuming
that's poetic license.

315
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,245
So, we might have a
chance to save Eliot.

316
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:37,015
Yeah.

317
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,009
Keep it up, Josh.

318
00:13:39,118 --> 00:13:41,952
I'm gonna go get
dressed for the banquet.

319
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,358
"Keep it up, Josh." (CHUCKLES)

320
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:50,996
Phew.

321
00:13:57,904 --> 00:13:58,997
Okay, fine. I'll bite.

322
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:01,540
What's the paper?
Perhaps, you've heard.

323
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:04,839
There's a wave of
hedge witch terrorism.

324
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:07,641
Is it a wave? Depends
on who you ask.

325
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:10,047
Certainly, The
Librarian who requested

326
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:12,709
a list of rejected
students had an opinion.

327
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:14,447
What? They asked
for a watch list?

328
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,113
Of potential hedges, yes.

329
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:19,392
Everyone has a line, Alice.

330
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:22,553
Apparently, mine
is turning over a list

331
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:23,823
to what's starting to feel

332
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:26,889
like a goddamn
totalitarian regime.

333
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,831
Who knew?

334
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:31,196
I have to resign.

335
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:34,331
Well, since you've
grown morals apparently,

336
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:35,773
I have an alternative.

337
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,970
Set myself on fire?
(CHUCKLES) Tempting.

338
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:43,510
Sack up and stay here,

339
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:45,743
where you can do an ounce
of good and protect the list.

340
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:48,888
I'm old. I'm tired.

341
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,721
I have no way to
protect it. Had no way.

342
00:14:52,792 --> 00:14:55,227
Zelda is outside, and
she needs your lab

343
00:14:55,328 --> 00:14:57,160
and a whole lot of magic.

344
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,928
And most importantly,
your secrecy.

345
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,399
Why should that come cheap?

346
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:05,404
Go talk to her,
while I research.

347
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:10,743
PENNY: Binders of various types.

348
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:13,642
JULIA: The word "Binder" is
in a ton of actual titles? Huh?

349
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:18,411
Google "The Binder,"
120 million hits.

350
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,921
You think that
dragon's trolling me?

351
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:23,456
PENNY: Anything new on Enyalius?

352
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,948
'Cause I got a
fresh take on that.

353
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:29,089
Let's find him, get his rock,

354
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:32,030
destroy it before the
Monster comes back.

355
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:34,391
QUENTIN: Oh, I love it.

356

to me was exaggerated.

It seems when she fragmented,

so did her personality.

with getting them out quickly

can reunite them at all, so...

But I've thought about
this and realized my,

442
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:05,693
our job here, is indeed to
do what's best for our lands,

443

not necessarily...

00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:27,014
I'm just saying, there
are so many paths...

451
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,315
During the feast, you will
order the castle doors open

452
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:31,117
whereupon my men will enter

453
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,250

was gonna say that?

for our own kingdoms.

this about me being bossy,

Stones. The stones.

535
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,741
The ones they
put part of me into.

536
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:50,214
But not yet.
They're still empty.

537
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:52,576
And rope.

538
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:57,918
Lots of rope. Nothing
here can hurt you.

539
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:01,558
They said they were
scared of me. Who?

540
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:05,890
Bacchus. Iris. Heka.

541
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:10,001
But they needed Enyalius.

542
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,061
They couldn't do it without him.

543
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:24,177
(GASPS)

544
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:28,081
I know what they did for
Enyalius to make him come.

545
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,283
There is a girl

546
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,790
near death.

547
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,521
She was their sacrifice.

548
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,621
Stop him.

549
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,290
Stop him.

550
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,359
Stop him. PENNY: I can't.

551
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,802
Everything that is happening
has already happened.

552
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:49,068
He called me monster,
but look at him.

553
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:50,473
He loved it.

554
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:53,478
The scent of a dying girl.

(GIRL WHIMPERING)

556
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:56,843
Some god of war.

557
00:26:56,949 --> 00:27:00,283
He only liked them when
they were too weak to fight.

558
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,980
You're not strong, Enyalius.

559
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,756
You're a sad,

560
00:27:07,826 --> 00:27:10,421

561
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:12,761
Why is this making me so upset?

562
00:27:13,432 --> 00:27:14,695
Maybe there's more here.

563
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,437
Keep watching.

565
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:27,777
He's bleeding. Should we...

566
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:31,339
No. He said to wait
as long as possible.

567
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:34,179
One more minute.

568
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,279
Hi. Thank God you saw the door.

569
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:39,450
No. It's me, it's me. It's
the real me. It's Eliot, okay?

570
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:41,936
This is a mind palace situation
and we don't have a lot of time,

571
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,880
and I have some extremely
major shit to tell you.

572
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,363
Maybe there's more.

573
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:47,694
Maybe there's more.

574
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:51,201
Maybe there's more.
What is it? What is it?

575
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:52,327
Traveler.

576
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:53,677
But it is only a matter of time

577
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:55,240
before he remembers
it, too, okay?

578
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,571
So, you have to... THE
MONSTER: Percy 23?

579
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,269
Shit. Go, go, go, go.

580
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:03,281
THE MONSTER: Percy 23. Percy 23.

581
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:05,010
Percy 23. Right here.

582
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:06,779
Where were you?

583
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,787
I was just exploring.
What did you see?

584
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,982
Nothing. There's
nothing else here.

585
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:14,016
If you are lying to me,
I will have you flayed.

587
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:19,063

589
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:24,602

(CLEARS THROAT)

591
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:32,867
Tell him I said thanks.

592
00:28:32,978 --> 00:28:36,506
I know just who to find
exactly to Enyalius' tastes.

593
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:38,412
We're going to find him,

594
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:41,180
and I'm going to be whole again.

595
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,579
This is a great day.

596
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:45,856

ZELDA: <i>Would
you care for a pipe?</i>

00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:07,179
We're a lot alike, you and I.

599
00:29:08,614 --> 00:29:11,880
My mother was a hedge
witch, too. She died.

600
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:13,610
I was 10.

601
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,048
I didn't know you
were a hedge. Oh, yes.

602
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:20,553
My mentor, Everett, found me,

603
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:23,255
sounds dramatic, in an alley.

604
00:29:23,729 --> 00:29:26,358
Gave me shelter, education,

605
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:28,928
believed in me.

606
00:29:30,736 --> 00:29:34,730
I will never need to do
those things again, but...

607
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:39,306
My choices now seem

608
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:40,902
worse. (CHUCKLES)

609
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:44,659
That's why I agreed to give you

610
00:29:44,683 --> 00:29:46,413
the location of
the pipe junction.

611
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:49,387
'Cause someone
gets hurt regardless.

612
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:53,919
Because I know

613
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:56,552
you'll work to keep things fair.

614
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,460
Safe.

615
00:29:58,563 --> 00:30:00,327
And you know this how?

616
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:04,627
Because we both had shitty moms?

617
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:08,468
Because you have the capacity

618
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:11,634
to sit with the woman who caused
the death of the man you love.

619
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:15,808
To try and understand her.

620
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:20,341
So, I have faith

621
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:22,944
you'll make choices that
hurt the fewest people.

00:30:27,693 --> 00:30:30,686
Okay, look, you can fix a
prism with Strand's Vitrum.

623
00:30:30,796 --> 00:30:32,025
Right, but do we need

624
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:34,531
to adjust the refraction
angle for a break, or...

625
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:36,192
I don't understand
sign language!

626
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,129
Okay.

627
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:40,672
You have to adjust, of course.

628
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:42,070
We need to cut a new prism.

No! You don't know!

What do I do? What do I do?

637
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,918
I do Strand's Vitrum.
Cut a new prism.

638
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:30,098
Combine Gentileschi... Doesn't
matter, though, because you're...

639
00:31:30,122 --> 00:31:31,681
I'm not. You're frozen.

640
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:34,090
You move one hand
to fix it, and you freeze.

641
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:35,403
You need to let me out of here.

642
00:31:35,427 --> 00:31:38,420
But what you wanna do...
What you actually deserve.

643
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:42,357
Maybe I do. Maybe
I'm just too much to live.

644
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:43,766
But the fact of the matter is,

645
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:45,480
if you throw one tiny
piece of magic in here,

646
00:31:45,504 --> 00:31:47,405
it bounces, and
we both vaporize.

00:31:47,506 --> 00:31:50,943
Yeah, well, don't be
so sure. I hate that idea.

648
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:55,408
You can't. See? You need me.

649
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,573
You, you're an egomaniac.

650
00:31:58,984 --> 00:32:01,385
You only care about
yourself. Someone had to.

651
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,081
No one else gave a shit.

652
00:32:03,155 --> 00:32:04,395
Because you alienated them all.

653
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:06,858
Our IQ did that.

654
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,450
Your arrogance. Oh.

exist unless you love me."

00:32:18,003 --> 00:32:19,003
Right.

660
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:21,404
That's exactly why
you destroyed the keys,

661
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:23,601

a goddamn genius.

00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:27,070
I didn't do that. You did.

664
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:29,114
That's bullshit! No.

665
00:32:29,214 --> 00:32:31,376
My arrogance didn't
destroy the stupid keys.

666
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:34,045
Fear did. You did.

667
00:32:37,923 --> 00:32:39,391
You ruined my life.

668
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,427
We did that together.

669
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:48,532
You're right. I
can't fix the prism.

670
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,829
Because it's a big swing
and it might blow up,

671
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:52,165
and that's my thing?

672
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,933
Do you wanna know what
the biggest swing there is?

673
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:57,168
Us agreeing.

674
00:32:57,676 --> 00:33:00,441
Self-destruction would be
a sad waste of both of us.

'Cause we still have no idea
what we're actually capable of.

676
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:06,782
That scares me, too.

677
00:33:06,852 --> 00:33:09,822
Does it scare you so much
you'd just rather never know?

678
00:33:10,288 --> 00:33:12,280
Just leave me in here to die?

ordinary waste of a life?

Well, that's not weird at all.

for... But we shouldn't.

Clearly, it wants us to.

sworn enemy of Fillory

711
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,441
and will not interact
with her citizens.

712
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:44,601
Much less High King.

713
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:46,167
You're joking.

714
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:47,643
But this whole...

715
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,648
I need him, Tick. For Eliot.

716
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:57,154
Oh, I see. How can I assist?

717
00:35:57,255 --> 00:35:59,281
Would you like me
to travel to the South

718
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:03,351
and use false Lorian
papers to seek an audience?

719
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:06,761
The Pickwicks are a
notoriously thirsty people,

720
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,595
making them
ill-suited for the desert,

721
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:12,160
and I have a violent
allergy to the sand.

722
00:36:12,237 --> 00:36:14,001
And of course,
I'm not a magician.

723
00:36:14,072 --> 00:36:16,541
But if it helps, it
would be an honor...

724
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:20,100
I get it. It's a job
for a tough bitch.

725
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,340
So, it has to be me.

726
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:24,849
Oh, thank you. I
would have died.

727
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:25,973
Oh, please.

728
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,820
You by any chance seen Margo?

729
00:36:28,887 --> 00:36:32,153
Oh, my semi-girlfriend who saved
my life and is also a great King?

730
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:34,783
No. Why?

731
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,623
No reason. Just, uh...

732
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:39,388
Oh.

733
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:42,956

have to go sneeze.

Or I will never forgive you.

741
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:01,579
And neither will Eliot,

742
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:05,054
if you keep me from getting
the one thing that can save him.

I'd listen to her!

Five seconds. Please.

761
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:34,638
Look, I should go with you.

00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:38,012
Josh, I can handle my shit.

763
00:38:38,116 --> 00:38:43,180
What I can't handle is Fillory blowing
up, so, please just help Fen. Okay?

764
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:45,515
Okay.

765
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,083

00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:15,011
Okay, I'm gonna try
and live through this

00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,520
'cause it's feeling like we
got some more banging to do.
