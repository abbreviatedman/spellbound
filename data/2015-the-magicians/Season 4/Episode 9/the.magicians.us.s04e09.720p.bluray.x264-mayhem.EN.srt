1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,537
<i>Previously on</i>
The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,628 --> 00:00:03,628
I need your help.

3
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:06,024
Those who go into the Mirror World
rarely find their way out.

4
00:00:06,048 --> 00:00:08,151
<i>- Who's in the Mirror World?
- My daughter.</i>

5
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:09,837
What you need to do
is pull her out.

6
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:11,463
I might have something.

7
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:14,921
It turns an ordinary object
into, sort of, a beacon.

8
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,803
<i>Thank you, Alice. Truly.</i>

9
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:20,226
There was some fallout
from your tracker coins.

10
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:21,348
Several hedges died.

11
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,350
Today we learned
the true danger we're in.

12
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,729
What about Penny?
He still, uh, sweating you?

13
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:29,060
He's not sweating me.

14
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,861
I was a goddess,
and now, I'm just

15
00:00:30,948 --> 00:00:33,315
your friendly neighborhood
bulletproof vest.

16
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:34,740
It would be
best for you

17
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:37,443
that you make this state
you find yourself in, temporary.

18
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,029
Have any advice
on how I do that?

19
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,613
You must seek the Binder.

20
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,948
A monster possessed you

21
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,520
- and is inhabiting your body.
- What?

22
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,980
<i>There's a door hidden deep
in a forgotten remembrance.</i>

23
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:48,621
Q, it's me. It's Eliot.

24
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,081
I'm alive in here.

25
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,666
Tell me my destiny.

26
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,047
A moment will come to protect
the future of Fillory.

27
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,129
A moment to stand beside
the High King

28
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:57,589
and then dethrone her.

29
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:59,140
Take her crown, Fen.

30
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:02,719
Even if that means
drenching it in her blood.

31
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,808
Hedge witches of the world,
this is your wake up call.

32
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,233
The Library
has turned the flow

33
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:11,561
of ambient magic
down to a trickle.

34
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:12,896
We fight for scraps.

35
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,822
It's time to cull the herd.

36
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:28,457
Defend yourself. Go on.
Throw something at me.

37
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,751
Cast anything...

38
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,296
This is what the worm does.

39
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,053
Try to remove it, same effect.

40
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:43,851
We will find you.
We will infect you.

41
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,394
You've been warned.

42
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:49,265
<i>Stop doing magic.
It's not for you.</i>

43
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,105
Fuckers call
themselves "Serpent".

44
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,561
Branding's a 'B' minus,

45
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,442
but they are
very much for real.

46
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:56,777
Wards are no help.

47
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:58,074
Last guy was attacked

48
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,868
in broad daylight
in his own kitchen.

49
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,498
Kady, it's Alice.

50
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:12,922
Can you let me in?
I'm just here to talk.

51
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:16,092
Oh, good. So, you don't
need the crowbar.

52
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:18,757
Hi. Go to hell. Bye.

53
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,133
Wait, no, I'm coming in.

54
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,215
So, hit me, or hear me out.

55
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,722
You're trying to
fight the Library.

56
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:25,811
Yeah, no, I'm not.

57
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:28,138
They're calling you the new Marina.

58
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,143
Actually, they are
calling you that.

59
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,184
Mostly even in good terms.

60
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,735
Hi. Listen,

61
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,154
we're not trying to step
on the foot of big government.

62
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,440
We're just trying to,
you know,

63
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,316
not die.

64
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,823
But you are doing something.

65
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,404
And I was inside
the Library, okay?

66
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:45,784
I can help.

67
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:48,895
Look, I've been
on an apology tour.

68
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:49,979
Would you like to
hear my speech?

69
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,003
No.

70
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,041
Why do you want to help?

71
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,497
None of us
went on that quest

72
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,127
so good people would

73
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:58,175
have to be slaves
for the Library

74
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,877
just to get a little magic.

75
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:02,134
I wanna fix it.

76
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:05,262
At least help.

77
00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:16,360
I feel better.

78
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:17,774
So, we're having a crisis.

79
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,901
You can help, you can stay.

80
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,033
Damn.

81
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:24,903
Hi, my name's Pete,
by the way.

82
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,114
I had no idea hedges
were taking it this far.

83
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,750
So, the Library
turned down the ambient.

84
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:34,197
- Is that how this started?
- They did more than that.

85
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:37,666
Mandatory cards, bans,
meters in houses...

86
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,218
And, I've seen those.
What's your plan?

87
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,407
We know this will
keep happening

88
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,218
if everyone's starving.

89
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,008
I helped open
a pipe in Modesto,

90
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:48,413
but we can't get
anywhere near that right now.

91
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:49,518
That was you?

92
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,812
Do you have any...

93
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,639
What I... We didn't
blow anything up,

94
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:56,477
and we definitely didn't know
anybody else would.

95
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,778
You're right.
You can't just open one.

96
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,275
You have to open 50, 100.

97
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,027
Everywhere. You'd need a...

98
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,244
You need a map
of the entire system.

99
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:10,949
We're listening.

100
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,584
Junction boxes.

101
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,786
Drop a tracer.

102
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,746
Follow the pipe.
Map the system.

103
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:19,340
Look for weak spots.
Spots with the most magic.

104
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,377
Great, how do we
find a box?

105
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,014
Oh, the one person I knew

106
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,215
who could help us,
the Library took her.

107
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,639
Okay, so, we need another way
to get at a box.

108
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,480
We need a mole.

109
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,273
Recruit a mole

110
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,316
inside the most powerful
institution in the multiverse?

111
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,229
Sure, why not?

112
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:44,566
<i>Stop doing magic.
It's not for you.</i>

113
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,162
Is this even
a Library matter?

114
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,867
Hedges murdering each other
in the streets is a security concern.

115
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,371
Can we use
the tracker Deweys?

116
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,579
They stopped using those.
They're not idiots.

117
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,129
Just psychopaths, then.

118
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,670
So, we continue to
do nothing till what?

119
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,503
They start putting blood worms
in card-carrying magicians?

120
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,847
We need a
middle-ground solution.

121
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:09,299
Temporary cure.

122
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,429
Reed's Mark.

123
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,058
I fail to see how hedges

124
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,310
will interpret
such as empathetic.

125
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,400
Agreed.

126
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:21,273
They might feel we're
taking away their defenses.

127
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:25,027
Well, get a blood worm
and cast, you boil alive.

128
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,357
So, there's that.

129
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,867
Reed's Mark
would prevent them

130
00:05:28,954 --> 00:05:31,617
from triggering the parasite,
even accidentally.

131
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:35,290
I'm barely aware half the time
I cast little things.

132
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,959
Still, they'd never
submit to it.

133
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,290
It would be voluntary.

134
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:44,759
<i>For those already infected,
and those living in fear.</i>

135
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:50,051
<i>No paperwork,
no questions asked.</i>

136
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:53,634
<i>Then once this Serpent group
have been dealt with,</i>

137
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,095
the mark is removed
free of charge.

138
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:01,188
Sound. I second.

139
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:03,861
Those opposed?

140
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:10,485
Motion passed.
Reed's Mark it is.

141
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:39,852
Anyone can be turned
with the right leverage.

142
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,149
It'll have to be
someone high up in the Library.

143
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,856
Everyone's got
a weak spot.

144
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:56,788
Mom, what's wrong?

145
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,122
What do you mean, inside?

146
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,581
Text me a picture.

147
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:12,509
Guys?

148
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,386
- What the fuck is going on?
- What is she saying?

149
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,351
What?

150
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,353
What do you mean,
you're in pieces?

151
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,569
- Guys, I think we have our leverage.
- Okay.

152
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,548
How is it possible?

153
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:51,169
- Is it shards?
- No. It'll add up to the real her.

154
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,512
The beacon summoned
the true Harriet.

155
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,261
It's just she's been
in the Mirror World so long.

156
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:57,726
It's a crazy place.

157
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:58,996
Something must have
happened to her

158
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,431
and shattered her
into three pieces.

159
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,263
And you,
your mother, and I,

160
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:03,751
we were the ones
that made the beacon,

161
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:06,142
so, a part of her
came to each of us.

162
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:10,146
So, what do you want?

163
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,732
The nearest
pipe junction box.

164
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,488
Why would I ever...
After Modesto...

165
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,284
Because you
want your daughter.

166
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,413
Look, we are trying to stop
what's happening out here.

167
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,209
More magic will lower
the body count,

168
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:27,334
or this situation you created
blows up into a full-on war.

169
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,416
You put more out
there for anyone...

170
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,341
Hedges have
always self-policed.

171
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:35,672
I consider it my
full-time responsibility.

172
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,097
You have my word.

173
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:40,930
Your proposal is very risky.

174
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,853
So is putting
Harriet back together.

175
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,349
But I can do it.
Can you?

176
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,337
I can fix her.

177
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,568
If you give Kady the box.

178
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:52,946
Fine, we have a deal.

179
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:57,243
A moment?
It's urgent. Sorry.

180
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:00,071
We'll give you a moment.
Alice, walk with me.

181
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,165
A few details.

182
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,742
An entire safe house?

183
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:05,836
In 10 minutes,

184
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,754
everybody was infected.
Half of them are dead.

185
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,127
We have to find that guy
in that stupid mask.

186
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,210
Now. Okay,
start some locators.

187
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:19,053
Casting spells in the current
socio-political climate is...

188
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,054
I much prefer
option 'B', which is,

189
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:22,476
this guy gets Reed's Mark

190
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,975
and waits until
this mushroom cloud dissipates.

191
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,397
You can't be serious.

192
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,644
I can't believe you're not.

193
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:29,771
I got your back,

194
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:33,480
but I would prefer to do that
in one solid non-crispy piece.

195
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,816
Give me a day.

196
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,550
That's hot,
that's hot, that's hot.

197
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,874
So, we're looking
for what, exactly?

198
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,960
Any reference

199
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:49,753
to the annoyingly vague
message the dragon sent me.

200
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,080
"Seek the Binder."

201
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:52,174
I hate riddles.

202
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,874
But if it could
jumper cable her, then...

203
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:57,052
In "D&D", a Binder's, like,
a low class level of...

204
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,299
- Announcement.
- Damn it.

205
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:02,474
The stone from your dragon
person is 100% god piece.

206
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,268
That is good news.

207
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,267
No.

208
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,357
The good news is

209
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,525
I can feel how many
pieces are still missing.

210
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:13,565
Any guesses?

211
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,856
The answer is one.

212
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,363
Only Enyalius stands between

213
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,944
me and anatomical perfection.

214
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,989
Find him and bring me
the final piece.

215
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:27,918
Cheesy puffs?

216
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,295
Um...

217
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:39,846
I guess we switch tracks
to find Enyalius.

218
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,797
It's not gonna be easy.
He knows we're looking.

219
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,759
A lot of gods kind
of have signatures. Um...

220
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:47,470
Ways to look for them,
whether they mean to or not.

221
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:48,564
So, we research and,

222
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,935
while we're there,
we solve this Binder shit.

223
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,648
Are we taking
our snacky friend?

224
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,148
Since I have no other way

225
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,401
to motivate you
than this meat sack,

226
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,278
know if you take too long,

227
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:03,111
I'm going ice cave climbing

228
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,411
with no clothes,

229
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,331
until this body
freezes forever.

230
00:11:12,714 --> 00:11:15,297
<i>Stop changing
the subject. The Napster?</i>

231
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,383
It's odd.

232
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:20,177
Not only is the Great Snow
100 years early, when it sings,

233
00:11:20,263 --> 00:11:21,263
it's in soprano.

234
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,347
Fascinating.

235
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,764
Can you tell me
what the cat lady

236
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,557
said about
my destiny lizard?

237
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:29,808
Well, the message
was very unclear.

238
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:32,015
You were mind melding
for 12 hours.

239
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,976
Uh, she's very mercurial.
Josh, hello!

240
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,276
Hi.

241
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,362
Glad you're back.

242
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:40,360
Talking points up the waz.
Here's number one.

243
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,066
Eliot! Alive.

244
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:44,944
- What?
- Yeah.

245
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,451
Q sent a troop
of these cuties to exposit.

246
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,873
Eliot's alive,
albeit in mind-prison,

247
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,666
while The Monster
controls the joystick.

248
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,621
Talking point <i>dos.</i>
Thank you.

249
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,923
A wild Fillorian clock tree
has sprouted up,

250
00:11:58,009 --> 00:11:59,841
leaving a village
stuck in time.

251
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:01,840
It's been a total
clockster fuck.

252
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,718
No? Nothing?

253
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:09,142
Okay, anyway,
with the ambient being so low,

254
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,706
that's the latest on
the magical weirdness list,

255
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,730
which is getting long.

256
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,043
- We should call the Council.
- Step ahead of you, sister.

257
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,649
In my official capacity

258
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,772
as pinch-hitter
and fill-in crown-wearer,

259
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,524
I planned a state dinner.

260
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:21,697
Nothing brings
peeps closer together

261
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:24,400
to solve a global
catastrophe like good eats.

262
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:27,202
Margo, you're gonna wanna
see the guest list.

263
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,075
Q is positive he's
alive in there?

264
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,165
Yeah.

265
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,494
Aww.

266
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,584
Oh. Oh!

267
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,417
I'll just

268
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,093
go now.

269
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,136
That was the most...

270
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:52,061
Thorough sex
I've ever had.

271
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,557
So, I'll see you
when I get back.

272
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:56,641
Uh, uh. But the royals
are arriving.

273
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:59,101
- And I have to go save Eliot.
- How?

274
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:02,108
Or, is the idea to
be a friend by dying?

275
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,027
Uh-huh. Don't make
a sorry dumb gesture.

276
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:07,075
Will you just stay
for the feast?

277
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,402
I invited the Foremost.

278
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,862
Foremost what?

279
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,663
He leads
a nomadic tribe that,

280
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,365
according to my apricot guy

281
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,325
who's tight with
their agave trader,

282
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,536
was once ravaged

283
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,461
by body-possessing
demonic spirits.

284
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:19,548
And?

285
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:23,592
And in act three of the movie,
the Foremost saved them

286
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,795
with special weapons
that expel possession.

287
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:27,470
You're shitting me.

288
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:29,924
Nope, that's the one thing
we didn't just do.

289
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:31,304
They call them ice axes,

290
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,010
and I'm assuming
that's poetic license.

291
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:35,228
So, we might have
a chance to save Eliot.

292
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,024
Yeah.

293
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,024
Keep it up, Josh.

294
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,944
I'm gonna go get dressed
for the banquet.

295
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:48,367
"Keep it up, Josh."

296
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:50,996
Phew.

297
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,001
Okay, fine. I'll bite.

298
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,546
- What's the paper?
- Perhaps, you've heard.

299
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,841
There's a wave of
hedge witch terrorism.

300
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,635
- Is it a wave?
- Depends on who you ask.

301
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:10,055
Certainly, The Librarian
who requested

302
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:12,724
a list of rejected students
had an opinion.

303
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,426
What? They asked
for a watch list?

304
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,102
Of potential hedges, yes.

305
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,398
Everyone has a line, Alice.

306
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:22,568
Apparently, mine is
turning over a list

307
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:23,814
to what's starting to feel

308
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:26,898
like a goddamn
totalitarian regime.

309
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,823
Who knew?

310
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:31,194
I have to resign.

311
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,325
Well, since you've grown
morals apparently,

312
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,781
I have an alternative.

313
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,959
Set myself on fire?
Tempting.

314
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,501
Sack up and stay here,

315
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:45,751
where you can do an ounce of
good and protect the list.

316
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:48,886
I'm old. I'm tired.

317
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:52,719
- I have no way to protect it.
- Had no way.

318
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,222
Zelda is outside,
and she needs your lab

319
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,143
and a whole lot of magic.

320
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,940
And most importantly,
your secrecy.

321
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,391
Why should that come cheap?

322
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:05,398
Go talk to her,
while I research.

323
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,740
Binders
of various types.

324
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,661
The word "Binder" is
in a ton of actual titles? Huh?

325
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:18,411
Google "The Binder,"
120 million hits.

326
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:21,918
You think that dragon's
trolling me?

327
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,461
Anything new on Enyalius?

328
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,957
'Cause I got a
fresh take on that.

329
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,092
Let's find him,
get his rock,

330
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:32,012
destroy it before
the Monster comes back.

331
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,385
Oh, I love it.

332
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:35,928
Ah.

333
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:38,761
Except for the part
where it doesn't save Eliot.

334
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,690
We'll figure something out.
We always do.

335
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,267
No, bro.

336
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,755
Take it from someone
from a timeline

337
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,146
where you did not
figure it out.

338
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,482
We'll find Enyalius first.

339
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:54,535
I'm not talking
about this now.

340
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:10,551
<i>But no one
made it out of that expedition alive.</i>

341
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,050
<i>Have you ever
wondered about your past lives?</i>

342
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,883
<i>If you have long-lost loves
or suppressed memories...</i>

343
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:17,976
Memories.

344
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,222
<i>...search no further.</i>

345
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,939
Thank God for
priority overnight.

346
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,438
I'll send your mom
some chocolates.

347
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,988
She'll like that,
if they're made of wine.

348
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,532
Traveler's blood?

349
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,537
Once it starts,

350
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:39,955
I'll have to seal the lab

351
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,498
and you'll both
have to wait outside.

352
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,332
Bjorn's Electromagnetic
is unstable.

353
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,334
Good thing
I'm a phosphoromancer.

354
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,970
- Okay, we're about ready.
- One thing.

355
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,925
The Harriet that came
to me was exaggerated.

356
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,681
It seems
when she fragmented,

357
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,262
so did her personality.

358
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:06,520
Just be aware.

359
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:07,651
Thanks.

360
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,193
But I'm more concerned
with getting them out quickly

361
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:14,114
to the same place, so we can
reunite them at all, so...

362
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,862
Now out, both of you.

363
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:21,865
Just don't fuck yourself up
too much, okay?

364
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,870
You punched me in the face.

365
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:25,955
Don't die.

366
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,937
Shit, it overloaded!

367
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,688
I have to fix the prism.

368
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,635
What are you doing?
No, we don't have any time.

369
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,366
We're running out of ambient.

370
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:44,534
I don't understand you.
Look, I have to do this now.

371
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:53,790
Oops. You fucked that one up.

372
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,464
Interesting application.

373
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,799
But I can improve on this.

374
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,509
Okay, but we have
to fix this now!

375
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:09,187
- No, we have time.
- No, we don't.

376
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,639
Don't be
such a scaredy bitch.

377
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,565
- I'm not.
- Ah.

378
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,773
That's what you are.
You're the mouse inside me.

379
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:17,529
I get you promised to fix her,

380
00:19:17,615 --> 00:19:19,968
but honestly, I don't see the point
in putting us back together.

381
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,029
You're absolutely worthless.
You can go now.

382
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:24,654
Give that back
to me right now!

383
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:25,821
No. I wanna play with it.

384
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,699
- Give it back. Give it back, you arrogant bitch!
- Mmm-mmm.

385
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:30,580
Oh, my God, your stupid face.

386
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,502
You're gonna destroy
everything again!

387
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,507
She's dangerous. I had to.

388
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,680
I need to. Just wait.

389
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,348
Move!

390
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,974
Move!

391
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:03,071
That bitch.

392
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,321
Hello? Hello!

393
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:10,119
God damn it.

394
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:13,702
Margo will want
those by the throne.

395
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,458
And you go
to the wine cellar.

396
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,588
- Oh, hi. You must be looking for the...
- Fen.

397
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:23,136
My name is Ru.
Queen of West Loria.

398
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,758
I'd like a private word.

399
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:26,715
Leave us.

400
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:31,637
What was your creature?

401
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,458
There's no sense
in denying it.

402
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,348
The thing told me
its sister visited you.

403
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,226
My prophecy was concise.

404
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,360
For the health of my land,

405
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,192
I must aid you
in dethroning the High King,

406
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:44,525
violently if necessary.

407
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:47,365
I see yours lines right up.

408
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:49,868
Look, Margo has
a reputation, but...

409
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,745
Gods, don't tell me
you're friends.

410
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,792
No, no.

411
00:20:54,879 --> 00:21:00,375
But I've thought about this
and realized my,

412
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:05,680
our job here, is indeed to do
what's best for our lands,

413
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,427
and that's just not
necessarily...

414
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,974
You're about to speechify
on fighting one's destiny?

415
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,097
No, no, no, no. Um...
On listening to one's guts.

416
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:14,225
I'm willing to forge
a peace with Fillory

417
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:16,523
once you take the throne.

418
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,067
Then and only then.

419
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:22,237
Wow. Okay.

420
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:27,034
I'm just saying,
there are so many paths...

421
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,327
During the feast,
you will order the castle doors open

422
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,120
whereupon my men will enter

423
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,247
- and chop off her head.
- Enjoy the dessert course.

424
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:36,167
Did you really think
I was gonna say that?

425
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,289
Hoped.

426
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:41,506
A ruler never walks away
of their own accord.

427
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:42,958
They must be crushed.

428
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:46,675
Now, I don't relish this,

429
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:49,507
but we are responsible
for our own kingdoms.

430
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,808
There is but one alternative.

431
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,018
Everlasting banishment.

432
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,558
But that's a form of death.

433
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,311
You have until dinner
to decide.

434
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,020
Or I'll be forced
to see to it

435
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:03,603
that your head joins hers
in the basket.

436
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,361
Quentin. Hoolia.

437
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:08,783
Whatever your name is.

438
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,610
I have the most perfect idea.

439
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:12,866
Um, who is that?

440
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:16,458
Is this a game, or...

441
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:19,457
Are you aware that
there's big money for psychics

442
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:22,506
who are in actuality
big, giant fakers?

443
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:26,426
I had to try 19
before I found a real one.

444
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,305
Allan,

445
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:33,304
you're going to
help me so much.

446
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:35,135
Help you with what, exactly?

447
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:38,017
Remembering my past life.

448
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,730
Could you guys
make me a snack?

449
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:41,103
We'd like some privacy.

450
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,776
Is that gonna be okay?

451
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:53,028
This guy's mind
better be strong as hell,

452
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:56,160
'cause if it gets
too hot in there...

453
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,250
Oh, boy.

454
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,750
Attention, customers.
Clean up in the baby food aisle.

455
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:07,630
You forgot the chips.

456
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,387
There's no pulse.

457
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,179
Relax. It's fine.

458
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:14,309
I'll get another one.

459
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,975
No, it won't work.
You're too strong.

460
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:19,805
Fine, I'll get
a strong one.

461
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,561
You're upset.

462
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,269
I'll get this gross corpse
out of your sight.

463
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,445
See you when I find
a new psychic friend.

464
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,614
Wait. I can help.

465
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,488
I know a psychic with
a real strong mind.

466
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:33,578
Penny, don't.

467
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,079
Who?

468
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:36,950
Me.

469
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:42,503
No.

470
00:23:42,922 --> 00:23:46,916
Just... You say no,
and then no?

471
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:48,849
Cute, you wanna make this
about me being bossy,

472
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:50,502
but we both just saw
that guy die.

473
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:53,339
I'm not that guy.
I studied this.

474
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,298
I had The Beast in my head.

475
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,634
Don't get me wrong.
I'm glad that you care.

476
00:23:57,728 --> 00:23:59,970
Ha-ha. But I actually do.

477
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:02,056
Ha-ha.
But I actually get that.

478
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,731
And I'm being serious.

479
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,522
So, how about this?

480
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:13,860
If I don't die,
I can take you out for a drink.

481
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:17,153
What, are you kidding?

482
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,204
That's something that
regular people do.

483
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,578
Yeah, fuck it.

484
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,035
Okay, try this.

485
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,209
Live,

486
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,580
and you can buy me dinner.

487
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,560
That was fun.

488
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:43,309
It took a lot of rocks
to sink the body.

489
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:46,350
Ready to get started, Percy?

490
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,369
Okay.

491
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,796
So, why are we here?

492
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,754
It's important.

493
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:16,429
Not sure why.

494
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,427
That's okay.

495
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:21,144
This field,

496
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:24,562
was there a house,
or anything else here?

497
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,435
No. Nothing.

498
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:31,061
Wait. An altar.

499
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,947
And some bowls.

500
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:40,867
Good. Think about the bowls.
Anything inside them?

501
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:43,790
Stones. The stones.

502
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,743
The ones they put
part of me into.

503
00:25:47,296 --> 00:25:50,209
But not yet.
They're still empty.

504
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:52,582
And rope.

505
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:57,921
- Lots of rope.
- Nothing here can hurt you.

506
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:01,550
- They said they were scared of me.
- Who?

507
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:05,888
Bacchus. Iris. Heka.

508
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,979
But they needed Enyalius.

509
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,061
They couldn't do
it without him.

510
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:28,077
I know what they did
for Enyalius to make him come.

511
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:30,295
There is a girl

512
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,790
near death.

513
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:36,505
She was their sacrifice.

514
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:41,306
Stop him.

515
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:43,345
- Stop him.
- I can't.

516
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,802
Everything that is happening
has already happened.

517
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:49,060
He called me monster,
but look at him.

518
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:50,481
He loved it.

519
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:53,480
The scent of a dying girl.

520
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,862
Some god of war.

521
00:26:56,949 --> 00:27:00,283
He only liked them
when they were too weak to fight.

522
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,992
You're not strong,
Enyalius.

523
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,745
You're a sad,

524
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:10,418
perverse little...

525
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:12,746
Why is this
making me so upset?

526
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,709
Maybe there's more here.

527
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:18,426
Keep watching.

528
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,760
He's bleeding. Should we...

529
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:31,348
No. He said to wait
as long as possible.

530
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,187
One more minute.

531
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,272
Hi. Thank God
you saw the door.

532
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:39,447
No. It's me, it's me.
It's the real me. It's Eliot, okay?

533
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:41,928
This is a mind palace situation
and we don't have a lot of time,

534
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,872
and I have some extremely
major shit to tell you.

535
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:47,698
Maybe there's more.

536
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:51,205
Maybe there's more.
What is it? What is it?

537
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:52,331
Traveler.

538
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:53,662
But it is only
a matter of time

539
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,246
before he remembers it,
too, okay?

540
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,582
- So, you have to...
- Percy 23?

541
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,258
- Shit.
- Go, go, go, go.

542
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:03,258
Percy 23. Percy 23.

543
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:05,010
- Percy 23.
- Right here.

544
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,762
Where were you?

545
00:28:06,852 --> 00:28:08,764
- I was just exploring.
- What did you see?

546
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,971
Nothing. There's nothing
else here.

547
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,023
If you are lying to me,
I will have you flayed.

548
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,071
Shit.

549
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,156
Penny!

550
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,570
That was helpful.

551
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:32,876
Tell him I said thanks.

552
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:36,500
I know just who to find
exactly to Enyalius' tastes.

553
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:38,418
We're going to find him,

554
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:41,171
and I'm going
to be whole again.

555
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,590
This is a great day.

556
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:45,848
Penny.

557
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:50,049
<i>Would you care for a pipe?</i>

558
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:07,160
We're a lot alike,
you and I.

559
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:11,865
My mother was
a hedge witch, too. She died.

560
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:13,623
I was 10.

561
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:17,036
- I didn't know you were a hedge.
- Oh, yes.

562
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:20,545
My mentor, Everett,
found me,

563
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:23,251
sounds dramatic,
in an alley.

564
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,337
Gave me shelter, education,

565
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:28,928
believed in me.

566
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:34,721
I will never need
to do those things again, but...

567
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:39,317
My choices now seem

568
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:40,894
worse.

569
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:44,676
That's why
I agreed to give you

570
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,407
the location of
the pipe junction.

571
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:49,361
'Cause someone
gets hurt regardless.

572
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:53,915
Because I know

573
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:56,539
you'll work to
keep things fair.

574
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,460
Safe.

575
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:00,334
And you know this how?

576
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,629
Because we both
had shitty moms?

577
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,464
Because you have the capacity

578
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:11,641
to sit with the woman who caused
the death of the man you love.

579
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:15,811
To try and understand her.

580
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:20,350
So, I have faith

581
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:22,936
you'll make choices
that hurt the fewest people.

582
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:30,694
Okay, look, you can fix
a prism with Strand's Vitrum.

583
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:32,028
Right, but do we need

584
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:34,535
to adjust the refraction angle
for a break, or...

585
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,206
I don't understand
sign language!

586
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,121
Okay.

587
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,669
You have to adjust,
of course.

588
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,088
We need to cut a new prism.

589
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,083
I don't know
what you're saying!

590
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,088
No! You don't know!

591
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:54,430
She destroyed my life with her crazy ideas
and her insane confidence.

592
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,805
God damn it.

593
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,004
Hi again, bitch.

594
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:24,960
What do I do? What do I do?

595
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,884
- I do Strand's Vitrum.
- Cut a new prism.

596
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,114
- Combine Gentileschi...
- Doesn't matter, though, because you're...

597
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,674
- I'm not.
- You're frozen.

598
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:34,098
You move one hand to fix it,
and you freeze.

599
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:35,384
You need to let me
out of here.

600
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:38,428
- But what you wanna do...
- What you actually deserve.

601
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:42,349
Maybe I do. Maybe I'm just
too much to live.

602
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,774
But the fact
of the matter is,

603
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,463
if you throw one tiny piece
of magic in here,

604
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:47,399
it bounces,
and we both vaporize.

605
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:50,948
Yeah, well, don't be so sure.
I hate that idea.

606
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:55,408
You can't. See?
You need me.

607
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,573
You, you're an egomaniac.

608
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,367
- You only care about yourself.
- Someone had to.

609
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,081
No one else gave a shit.

610
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,371
Because you alienated
them all.

611
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:06,836
Our IQ did that.

612
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,461
Your arrogance. Oh.

613
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,422
"I'm so smart. Look at me."

614
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:13,550
"Love me, love me.
I won't exist unless you love me."

615
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,553
"I'm so sorry I'm smart.
It's not you, it's me.

616
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:17,929
"I'm so sorry."

617
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,019
Right.

618
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:21,387
That's exactly why
you destroyed the keys,

619
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,598
because you're such a
goddamn genius.

620
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:27,068
I didn't do that. You did.

621
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:29,111
- That's bullshit!
- No.

622
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:31,359
My arrogance didn't destroy
the stupid keys.

623
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:34,029
Fear did. You did.

624
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:39,371
You ruined my life.

625
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,415
We did that together.

626
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:48,540
You're right.
I can't fix the prism.

627
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:50,841
Because it's a big swing
and it might blow up,

628
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,168
and that's my thing?

629
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,922
Do you wanna know what
the biggest swing there is?

630
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:57,177
Us agreeing.

631
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:00,427
Self destruction would be
a sad waste of both of us.

632
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,979
'Cause we still have no idea
what we're actually capable of.

633
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:06,774
That scares me, too.

634
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,819
Does it scare you so much
you'd just rather never know?

635
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,272
Just leave me in here to die?

636
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:16,735
And you go live
your ordinary waste of a life?

637
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,551
Well, that's not weird at all.

638
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,845
Does that say "Binder"?

639
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:43,053
- Isn't Julia looking for...
- But we shouldn't.

640
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,513
Clearly, it wants us to.

641
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:47,564
Let's not get
precious about it.

642
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,746
All right, let's fix
this fucker.

643
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:31,142
Okay, are you ready
to pull yourself together?

644
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:42,371
Red alert.

645
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:45,539
So, there is a
palace coup underway.

646
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,371
Fen is planning
to defenestrate you.

647
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,794
It's a destiny thing.

648
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,794
That balsa-toed bitch.

649
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:57,342
I'd like to see her try.

650
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,466
Quick. Where's the Foremost?

651
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:01,343
Not here yet, I guess.

652
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,470
Hold off the traitor
till I talk to him.

653
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:06,640
- Then let her come.
- Okay. Great.

654
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:16,312
Stand here, so,
Fen can't see me.

655
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:17,692
She's trying to overthrow me.

656
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,774
It's a long story
and I'm handling it.

657
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:22,736
Where is the Foremost?

658
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,991
Leader of the Southern Nomads?

659
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:27,038
Wandering in the south,
I imagine.

660
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:30,084
He and his axes are supposed
to be here, Tick.

661
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,537
But he'd never come to this.

662
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,087
Oceans of apology, Majesty,

663
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:40,886
but the Foremost
is a sworn enemy of Fillory

664
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,430
and will not interact
with her citizens.

665
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:44,597
Much less High King.

666
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,175
You're joking.

667
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,635
But this whole...

668
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:52,640
I need him, Tick.
For Eliot.

669
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:57,148
Oh, I see.
How can I assist?

670
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,275
Would you like me
to travel to the South

671
00:35:59,366 --> 00:36:03,360
and use false Lorian papers
to seek an audience?

672
00:36:03,453 --> 00:36:06,742
The Pickwicks are
a notoriously thirsty people,

673
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,572
making them ill-suited
for the desert,

674
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:12,160
and I have a violent
allergy to the sand.

675
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,994
And of course,
I'm not a magician.

676
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:16,547
But if it helps,
it would be an honor...

677
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:20,092
I get it. It's a job
for a tough bitch.

678
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,340
So, it has to be me.

679
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,843
Oh, thank you.
I would have died.

680
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:25,969
Oh, please.

681
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,808
You by any chance seen Margo?

682
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:32,138
Oh, my semi-girlfriend who saved
my life and is also a great King?

683
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:34,770
No. Why?

684
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,600
No reason. Just, uh...

685
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,402
Oh.

686
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:42,948
Actually, uh,
I have to go sneeze.

687
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,784
- Can we talk?
- Do it.

688
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:48,578
- Excuse me?
- Fen.

689
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,199
Do it.

690
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:53,746
I don't understand.

691
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:56,830
Overthrow me right
the fuck now, Fen.

692
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:59,666
- I never should have...
- Or I will never forgive you.

693
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:01,584
And neither will Eliot,

694
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:05,046
if you keep me from getting
the one thing that can save him.

695
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:09,554
Um...

696
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:14,430
Excuse me.

697
00:37:14,524 --> 00:37:16,390
I need a word with the guard.

698
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:37,124
<i>By order of High King Fen,</i>

699
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:41,791
<i>Margo of tribe Hansen
is forever banished,</i>

700
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:45,378
never again to step upon
the soil of Fillory,

701
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:47,759
never again
to breathe its air,

702
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,215
or feel its magic.

703
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:50,845
Oh, get on with it.

704
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,978
Son of a pig fucker.

705
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:01,568
Perfect words to
remember you by.

706
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:06,445
Wait!
I curse Fen's name.

707
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,617
But if I were you,
I'd listen to her!

708
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:11,741
And wait!
Be nice to her!

709
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:15,916
Your grandkids'
grandkids will fear me!

710
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:25,088
Margo, wait!

711
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,963
Five seconds. Please.

712
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,636
Look, I should go with you.

713
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:38,018
Josh, I can handle my shit.

714
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:43,193
What I can't handle is Fillory blowing up,
so, please just help Fen. Okay?

715
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,521
Okay.

716
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,071
For your journey.

717
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:52,282
Just a few simple fig apricot saffron
cardamom vanilla plum danishes.

718
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:53,372
They'll keep.

719
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:56,665
So, and a new map.
Very helpful.

720
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,368
Also, fully charged.

721
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,124
When the going gets tough,

722
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:02,955
tough listens
to pop anthems from the '80s.

723
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,568
- Josh...
- Just a thought. Never mind.

724
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,174
You're a good man.

725
00:39:06,261 --> 00:39:07,342
Oh.

726
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:15,017
Okay, I'm gonna try
and live through this

727
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:17,516
'cause it's feeling like
we got some more banging to do.

728
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,267
It does, right?

729
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:23,355
But don't wait for me, Hoberman.
Let's be realistic.

730
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:24,855
Totally. Totally.

731
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:27,734
I'm probably going to wait for you, though.
So, sorry.

732
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:31,488
Don't be a fool, Josh.

733
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:38,992
<i>Now, there's
no looking forward</i>

734
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:41,498
<i>Now, there's no turning back</i>

735
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:44,251
<i>When you say
We belong to the light</i>

736
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,957
<i>We belong to the thunder</i>

737
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,546
<i>We belong to the sound of
the words</i>

738
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:55,724
<i>We've both fallen under</i>

739
00:39:55,810 --> 00:40:01,556
<i>Whatever we deny or embrace
for worse or for better</i>

740
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:08,488
<i>We belong we belong
we belong together</i>

741
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,915
It's been far too long.

742
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:21,537
I think we should go in.

743
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:37,633
Alice, you okay?

744
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:39,844
All in one piece,
but a little shaky.

745
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:43,188
Let's get you
several snacks, huh?

746
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:46,401
Thank you.

747
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,687
Consider the list
misplaced indefinitely.

748
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,472
<i>There's nothing we can
do while he just goes out there</i>

749
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:02,696
<i>and looks for someone to kill.</i>

750
00:43:03,873 --> 00:43:07,867
- We have to do something.
- Yeah, I know. But what?

751
00:43:09,879 --> 00:43:11,871
Whoa, hey, hey,
hey, hey.

752
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,500
- Dude, sit down.
- No.

753
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:16,963
- You just had a seizure.
- Where's the Monster?

754
00:43:17,053 --> 00:43:19,545
He's looking for a girl
for Enyalius.

755
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,426
Okay. I saw Eliot in there.

756
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:23,678
- Is he...
- Alive. And poking around like a pro.

757
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:27,853
The Monster, everything he can't remember,
it's in there. All of it.

758
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:29,271
Wait, Eliot saw this?

759
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:33,101
He saw something in the
Monster's memories, buried.

760
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:35,277
We've been wrong
about everything.

761
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:36,899
He's not trying
to rebuild his body.

762
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,175
That's not what
the stones are.

763
00:43:38,199 --> 00:43:40,691
That's not what they're for.

764
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:42,492
It's so much worse than that.
