- Always an interesting day.

739
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,360
Except for me.

740
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,670
I heard.

741
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,630
It's not super surprising,
given the fact

742
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:33,640
that I haven't been able
to do a single piece of magic.

743
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:36,240
- Well, so far.
- [chuckles]

744
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:37,540
Heard that as well.

745
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:40,340
They're calling me a squib.

746
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,750
I even heard
Professor Lipson say it

747
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,580
when she thought
I was out of the room.

748
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,650
[groans]

749
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,480
I'll talk to her about that.

750
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,250
We discourage that term.

751
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:51,590
It's considered hate speech.

752
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,490
I mean, but don't you agree?

753
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,430
Do you?

754
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,130
- Well, I...
- [sighs]

755
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,830
I mean, I think I got
the highest math scores

756
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,130
in the history
of my high school,

757
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:04,430
and I graduated Harvard
on my 19th birthday.

758
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,870
- Who didn't?
- [laughs]

759
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:10,270
I... I'm just saying, I...

760
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:12,540
Look, of course
I want to keep trying.

761
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,410
It's like...
the moment that I found out

762
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:20,350
- magic was real...
- Mm.

763
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:23,720
That was the moment
that I discovered who I am.

764
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:27,720
You remind me
of a young woman I once knew.

765
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,690
Similar tenacious mind.

766
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:33,600
I rejected her from Brakebills.

767
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:36,370
Why?

768
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,870
Suffice to say,

769
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,370
I had much evidence
I was doing the right thing,

770
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:42,940
but out on her own,

771
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:45,710
she got hurt, badly.

772
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:49,550
I had chosen not to protect her.

773
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,650
I'm simply not willing
to repeat that choice with you.

774
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,620
So...

775
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:58,590
Patience.

776
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,920
Magic is real.

777
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,760
Magic is real!

778
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,930
This is the trippiest thing
I have ever seen.

779
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:09,300
I gotta say, you're
taking this pretty well.

780
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:11,200
Well, you know,

781
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,670
it's all an illusion.

782
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,570
The Grand Maya.

783
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:16,810
Right, yeah.

784
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,780
The Grand Maya.
Of course, man.

785
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:20,410
Can I just say one thing?

786
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:22,280
- I cannot believe...
- Hey.

787
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:24,650
- You're DJ Hansel.
- Stay close, okay?

788
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,280
This medal thing,
it works better

789
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,320
- the closer you are.
- I've been listening

790
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,280
to your Taylor Swift remix
nonstop.

791
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,120
Is it true
that you guys hooked up?

792
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,390
- Um, Janet?
- [gasps]

793
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,320
- Sorry.
- You always do that.

794
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,660
I was just wondering

795
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:35,930
what you want me to say
about all these plane tickets.

796
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,700
I don't want you
to say anything.

797
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,830
I want you to expense them.

798
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:42,370
Oh, well, it's just that

799
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,630
they don't usually
allow so many.

800
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:46,440
Yeah, huge feature, okay?

801
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:48,870
- That's DJ Hansel.
- Hey, how you doing?

802
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:50,440
Yeah, these are his minions.

803
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,570
Put that, okay?

804
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,710
And lattes, Sophie,
from the other place.

805
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,510
You know, the one that...
The little thing I like.

806
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,610
- Okay, okay.
- Yeah, yeah, and...

807
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:58,520
And almond milk, please,
if you don't mind.

808
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,720
- She's young.
- I'm working with her.

809
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,350
You were working with her.

810
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,990
Now, who knows?

811
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:08,020
Who knows anything?

812
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:11,530
- Right, 'cause magic is real.
- You know?

813
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,630
Literally.

814
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:15,400
Like in movies,
except literally real.

815
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:18,270
So no one can find
Kim the architect;

816
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,970
Nigel, the bastard son
of a British lord,

817
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:23,040
was reported missing
by his family;

818
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:25,540
And, uh, Brian
the English professor,

819
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,440
also reported missing.

820
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,880
- Not worrying, not worrying.
- Or another way to look at it

821
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:30,710
is that the whole
goddamn thing is worrying

822
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,820
and no one thing
is any more or less worrying

823
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:34,320
than anything else.

824
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:35,850
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey, hey, hey.

825
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,490
You need breath work, man.

826
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:43,530
So how do we figure out
who we really...

827
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,930
Don't say it.

828
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,300
- Shh.
- Okay, just...

829
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:49,370
I don't know how we're supposed

830
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,300
to talk about this

831
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,600
if we're not allowed
to talk about this.

832
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,770
Yeah, I mean,
shouldn't all of us

833
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:57,370
being in a room together
be enough to...

834
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:58,510
- I don't know, I mean...
- Okay, look.

835
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:02,680
Apparently, you have to poke
the fake ID aspect

836
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:04,950
of the situation
pretty directly.

837
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,850
Okay, just talk around it, okay?

838
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:09,350
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

839
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:13,820
I say we find the writer
of this comic book, right?

840
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:16,030
James Tyberius R. Martin
is clearly a penname,

841
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,730
but whoever he is,
maybe he knows something

842
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,400
- that can help us.
- Yeah, but...

843
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:20,500
But that written 14 years ago.

844
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:23,470
I mean, what does that
even mean?

845
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,740
Because I have memories
from before,

846
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:28,710
but they're not really mine
because I'm...

847

Oh, God.

851
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,950
You know, the guy
that got hit by a truck...

852
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:44,750
- Did he die?
- He's still in the hospital.

853
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,730
Well, if he's alive,

854
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,130
then we can ask him
some questions.

855
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,760
Oh, I wish you wouldn't.

856
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,470
I really feel
you've done enough for him.

857
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,900

858

I'm Marina.

859
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:02,640
You almost killed
a good friend of mine

860
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,940
and stole that from him,
which he was borrowing.

861
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,410
So, really,
you stole it from me.

862
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:08,980
Okay, relax.

863
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:11,110

Yeah, of course.

Of course I am.

868
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,460

871
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,030
Anyway, we'll have to do it
once we get there.

872
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,760
We have to hurry now.

873
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,070
Where... where are we going?

874
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,070
Scoop of pistachio with jimmies.

875
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,110
- I said I wanted sprinkles.
- Jimmies are sprinkles.

876
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,910
No, stop, jimmies are sprinkles!

877
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:41,670
Ah!

878
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,650

It's the only time to catch him.

882
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:55,760

00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:06,570
you kill these little bodies

00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:10,370
Hey, is there another game
that we can play?

887
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:13,910
One where we don't flay anybody?

888
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,340
Oh, but he deserves it,

889
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,910

- What... what friends?

Oh, but we can't talk

And we know if we poke it,

927
