1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,715
Previously, on <i>"The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:04,299
<i>- I killed a god.
- The old gods...</i>

3
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,930
<i>When we're harmless,
they ignore us,</i>

4
00:00:05,931 --> 00:00:07,990
<i>but when we become malignant,
they amputate.</i>

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,500
- Magic is gone.
- I need to show you something.

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,860
Oh, my God.

7
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:17,370
I have magic.

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,830
<i>Do you want your magic back
or not?</i>

9
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:21,770
I'll send you on an epic quest.

10
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:23,670
<i>"The Tale
of the Seven Keys."</i>

11
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,340
Jules, this is our quest.

12
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,550
<i>I think I'm leveling up.</i>

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,080
- I'm...
- A full-on goddess.

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,250
<i>You're here about the fountain.</i>

15
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:37,150
The backdoor to magic.

16
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,450
Alice, what are you doing?

17
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,560
She's destroying the keys!

18
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,560
<i>I know you thought
this was for everyone's good.</i>

19
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:45,430
You'll see someday it wasn't.

20
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,830
Julia, you could
lose your power.

21
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,870
Once magic is flowing again,

22
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,370
<i>you have 30 seconds
to attach the siphon.</i>

23
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,510
<i>I hear you have
an experimental potion</i>

24
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,540
that not only wipes your memory,

25
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,380
but creates a whole new persona.

26
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:05,580
<i>She made a deal with us,
then broke it.</i>

27
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:08,920
Unlike the others,
she belongs to the Library.

28
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,490
That thing, it can jump bodies.

29
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,720
It's seen them.

30
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,590
<i>It knows magic is back.</i>

31
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,430
<i>It knows they're magicians,
even if they don't.</i>

32
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,230
If they don't know who they are,

33
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,130
if they don't have magic,

34
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,560
they can't protect themselves.

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,600
Will you play with me?

36
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:23,430
I think you've got me...

37
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:25,370
mistaken for somebody else.

38
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,730
I think anything is more fun

39
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,640
when you do it with a friend.

40
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,610
Feels like
there's never a reason

41
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:37,950
to last that long.

42
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,580
Um, I will catch you guys
tomorrow, yeah?

43
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,850
Okay.

44
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,570
Shit!

45
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,310
Shit.

46
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,710
My God.

47
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,570
Shit.

48
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,780
Uh, hi.
Um, hello.

49
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:17,050
Hi.

50
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,480
Kimber D'Antoni?

51
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,380
Uh-huh.

52
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,460
I'm Todd.

53
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,960
You're late.

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,100
Follow me.

55
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,630
- Uh, I... I'm sorry.
- Where am I?

56
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,500
Upstate New York.

57
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,040
- Brakebills University.
- Okay, hold on. How...

58
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,870
- Good afternoon.
- Nice to see you.

59
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,440
- How is that possible?
- Pro tip,

60
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,540
in case you remember any of this:

61
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,040
Always be polite to Librarians.

62
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,880
They look harmless,
but they do regulate

63
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,480
the good stuff, you know?

64
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,080
Make them cranky,
all of a sudden,

65
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,550
there's this lag time
when you put in a request.

66
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,350
I mean, New World Order,
definitely better than it was,

67
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:00,920
but in my humble "O," a little
worse than the old days.

68
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,120
Okay, uh, stop.

69
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,890
- I'm sorry, what's happening?
- Oh.

70
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,530
You've been offered
a preliminary exam

71
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,960
for entry into the graduate program.

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,570
Am I hallucinating?

73
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,640
I mean, if I say no,

74
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,740
that could be part of it, right?

75
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:18,070
But, I mean, no.

76
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,940
Um, really no. Nope.

77
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,510
Okay, yeah.

78
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,950
That definitely
wasn't helpful at all.

79
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,510
- So...
- Sorry.

80
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,520
Come on. We gotta hustle.

81
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,920
Late!

82
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,920
Welcome.

83
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,630
You may address me as Dean.

84
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,460
I know you all have questions.

85
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,770
They will be answered in time.

86
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,670
For the next hour,

87
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,440
your task is to complete
your test.

88
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,880
Best of luck to you all.

89
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,110
Begin.

90
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,790
You know, this would go faster

91
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,020
if we could just do them
all in one batch,

92
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,730
like we used to.

93
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,560
You know we don't have
that kind of supply.

94
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,630
- Yeah.
- I'm just saying.

95
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:18,630
I mean, how many extra hours
of our time is this taking,

96
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,200
when the Library
could just give it to us?

97
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,970
Come on.
You know you're thinking it.

98
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,010
Well, looks like
the weird one's a dud.

99
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,050
Is the one you said...

100
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,490
Shorted out the globe?

101
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,020
Yeah.

102
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,820
Never seen that before.

103
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,930
It was late in the day, no?

104
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,490
Supply runs low.

105
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,700
Could be that.

106
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,230
True.

107
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,730
I'll pull her and wipe her

108
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,800
as soon as she's done
the written portion.

109
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,410
Ah, damn it.

110
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,240
What was that?

111
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,110
- I'm not quite sure.
- Let me see...

112
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,010
I'd advise against it.

113
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,080
I didn't see anything.

114
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,850
I've got a splitting headache.

115
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,250
Okay.

116
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,920
I'll take your word for it.

117
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,960
- So keep or lose the migraine?
- Let's keep.

118
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,060
For now.

119
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,950
<i>Saw it with my own eyes.</i>

120
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,990
Periplaneta Americana.

121
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,620
- Huge.
- Wow.

122
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,490
A cockroach can't be good
for the books.

123
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:49,620
Exactly.

124
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,690
I'm thinking of posting a sign
to remind everyone

125
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,060
that their mother
doesn't work here,

126
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,300
and they should clean up
their own crumbs.

127
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,900
- That's funny.
- Very clever.

128
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,230
Thank you.

129
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,200
Should I use Helvetica
or Times New Roman?

130
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,170
Would Comic Sans
communicate good cheer

131
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:04,740
or undercut the seriousness
of the message?

132
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:25,130
Even your breathing
is depressing today.

133
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,660
You know that, Alice?

134
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,000
Hey, I have an idea.

135
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,000
- Yeah?
- Yeah, go fuck yourself.

136
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,770
I'm not here to entertain you.

137
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,770
Huh.

138
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,340
If you say so.

139
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,270
'Cause the other day,
when you tried to escape,

140
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,710
that was funny.

141
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,780
All that kicking and shrieking.

142
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,940
Gives me a big chuckle
every time I think of it.

143
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,220
Good day, Ms. Quinn.

144
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,090
Lunch.

145
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,120
I thought you had slaves
for that.

146
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,090
Junior Librarians.

147
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,360
I must insist you eat today.

148
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,060
Fine. Insist away.

149
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,240
Oh.

150
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,970
You nosy bitch.

151
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,310
Excuse me?

152
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,180
You read my book, huh?

153
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,380
Right up to the great
blank spot.

154
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,250
Did you read that whole
chapter, hmm?

155
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,180
You wanna talk about
all the positions

156
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,720
Quentin and I were in?

157
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:26,950
Did my book tell you
how many times I came?

158
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,660
I can't let you starve,

159
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,860
and I don't want
to force you to eat.

160
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,790
Neither of us would enjoy that.

161
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,240
Keep cooperating,
and you may continue to receive

162
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:47,140
approved reading material.

163
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,010
Wait.

164
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,850
I have a question.

165
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,680
I'm sorry.

166
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,650
Dean Fogg's not coming.

167
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,800
Dean Fogg.

168
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:11,770
The new students?

169
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:13,730
Appreciate you coming

170
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,870
all the way here
to deliver this.

171
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,940
- Yes, well, you did...
- What's the word?

172
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,880
Mandate that I do so.

173
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:21,780
A formality.

174
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:22,640
We have the utmost faith

175
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,250
in your selection methods.

176
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,280
This is merely for our records.

177
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,450
Hmm.

178
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,290
This one.

179
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,990
Professor Lipson reported
she caused an unusual reaction

180
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,660
on your globe.

181
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,220
Do you know why?

182
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,230
I'm sure it'll become clear.

183
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,900
She shows great potential.

184
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,200
In what way?

185
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:45,330
I'm not sure yet,

186
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:48,300
but that's why
she's at Brakebills.

187
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,240
Well, I trust your instinct.

188
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,240
Approved.

189
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,310
Always a pleasure.

190
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,980
Alice is fine.

191
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:02,080
Depressed, surly.

192
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,920
Still asking to see you again.

193
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:07,660
She's fixated on the thing
she says she saw in the castle.

194
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,590
You told her, didn't you?

195
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,660
That your
independent contractors

196
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,760
are looking into the threat,
yes,

197
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,230
but she's not worried
about mass destruction.

198
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,630
She's worried about her friends.

199
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:19,870
I can't think of anyone
better protected than they.

200
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,440
<i>Let's be frank, Zelda.</i>

201
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,950
My students saved magic.

202
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,210
The world may throw flowers
at the feet of the Order

203
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,880
and Irene McAllistair,

204
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,520
but you and I both know
the goddamn truth.

205
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,120
The Order stepped into
an oversight position.

206
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,690
Everything we do
is to preserve knowledge,

207
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:43,990
to make things safer.

208
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,790
I'm not arguing the benefits.

209
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:47,960
But you are,
because they come at a cost.

210
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,430
<i>Bottom line:
If your students resurface,</i>

211
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,500
<i>I can't stop Irene
from doing what she will</i>

212
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,070
<i>to ensure their silence.</i>

213
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,900
<i>We have certain...</i>

214
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,910
<i>agreements with her as well.</i>

215
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,910
So...

216
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:06,980
they must stay where they are,
as they are.

217
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,020
<i>They'll be fine.</i>

218
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,490
<i>Your spellwork was...</i>

219
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,020
<i>masterful.</i>

220
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,560
You know my one solace, Zelda?

221
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:19,490
When my attempts to protect them

222
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:21,430
<i>inevitably fail,</i>

223
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,830
<i>their blood
will be on your hands.</i>

224
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:43,450
Have a good day, Zelda.

225
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,760
<i>- Don't tell me to relax.
- I'm pissed.</i>

226
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,800
- Okay.
- I get it.

227
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,040
- But you're overreacting.
- I should throw this at you.

228
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,540
Sam, come on.

229
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:04,970
You made three
very strong arrests.

230
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:07,810
And this douchewater
just walks away,

231
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,910
based on what?

232
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,140
Explain that to me.

233
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,750
That douchewater
always gets away.

234
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,050
What are you talking about?

235
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,650
Seen him booked six times.

236
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:16,720
Never sticks.

237
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,820
Hey, what can I say?
Some people are lucky.

238
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,720
Or their lawyers are.

239
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,520
My advice is, let it go.

240
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,940
Uh, excuse me, miss?

241
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,640
Can I help you?

242
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,200
That guy.

243
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,570
He was just here.

244
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,440
Oh, I must not have heard.

245
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:51,650
Have a good day, sir.

246
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,850
Hmm...

247
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,710
"Hedge witch."

248
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,720
Oh, shit.

249
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,060
Oh, come on.

250
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,960
Piece of shit.

251
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,640
Damn it.

252
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:52,040
Get your shit together,
Cunningham.

253
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,150
Shit!

254
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,120
Of course.

255
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,850
- Hi, Mark.
- Listen, I know you're a cop.

256
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,350
Yeah, and, uh,
I know what you are.

257
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,880
I was just, uh, leaving.

258
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,850
Yeah, I've noticed
you're good at that.

259
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:12,190
Six arrests,
nothing ever sticks.

260
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,220
- Look, I don't hurt anyone.
- It's all strictly side hustle.

261
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,990
Cut the shit.

262
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,860
I know there's more of you.

263
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,030
That you call yourself, what?
Hedge witches?

264
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,300
What the hell?

265
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,830
I'm not stealing anything
that's gonna hurt anyone.

266
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,630
Minor shit.
Charms, enhancements.

267
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,870
Nothing dark and... look,
I have no interest

268
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,310
in poking whatever kind
of witness-protection spell

269
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,970
you've got going, okay?

270
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,980
That thing tried to kill me
for looking at it.

271
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:38,080
What are you talking about?

272
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,850
Charms, enchantments.

273
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,720
What, is that French
for "crystal meth"?

274
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,990
You have no idea, do you?

275
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,620
You just think you're you.

276
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,990
Not so fast.

277
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,020
What is that?

278
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,690
Spelling bee medal?

279
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:53,660
- Give that back.
- What is it?

280
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,330
Protection.

281
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,130
From?

282
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,830
You.

283
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:58,900
Wait, stop!

284
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,250
<i>Yoo-hoo!</i>

285
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,450
<i>Arise, Your Majesty.</i>

286
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,720
<i>Arise.</i>

287
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,870
What the hell?

288
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:45,350
You may approach, High King.

289
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,510
Come, come.

290
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,150
Let's take a look at you.

291
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,860
Hi.

292
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:57,330
What the fuck is going on?

293
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,390
Mm, it's a little bit worrying

294
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:01,400
that you don't seem
to know, considering.

295
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,430
"Considering"?

296
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,930
Are those horns?

297
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,400
Wait.

298
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,040
Am I at Jeff Goldblum's house
right now?

299
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:11,940
What did I take?

300
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:14,010
You are asleep.

301
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,010
I, Ember,
greatest ever God of Fillory,

302
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:18,950
am blessing a visitation
of my person

303
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:21,950
on your prone
and receptive state.

304
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,090
Well, more technically,

305
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,120
I, an energetic emanation

306
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,360
previously placed here
by the great God Ember,

307
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,860
have been activated
to contact you.

308
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,130
"Activated."

309
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,030
Activated, mm,

310
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:39,300
by a disturbance
of great magnitude.

311
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:42,340
Alarums, Majesty!

312
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,410
I have emanated to warn you.

313
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,240
Great ill is afoot.

314
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,040
Okay.

315
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,880
We're gonna have to take this
from the top, all right?

316
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,850
Because I literally haven't
been this confused

317
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,080
since the time I woke up
in bed with Banksy.

318
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,280
This is concerning.

319
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,290
Which part?

320
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,060
For one thing,
you look awfully like...

321
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:03,060
a female.

322
00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:04,490
It's chilling.

323
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,230
No matter.

324
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,860
You must get to work
immediately, High King.

325
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,460
Great, sure.

326
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,370
Work on?

327
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,100
Well, this glorious emanation

328
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,500
can only be triggered
by world war,

329
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,070
pandemic, arrival of hostile

330
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,910
or uninvited gods
onto Fillorian soil,

331
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,880
revolt of dwarves,
or mass rising of the dead.

332
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:27,880
Not sure they'd be able
to do much, the dead.

333
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,920
They're sort of feeble
and rotting.

334
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,450
It just struck me as creepy,

335
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:33,620
and I'd rather you put
a stop to it.

336
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,320
Okay, horn person?

337
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,160
My name is Janet.

338
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:39,430
I'm not a king.

339
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,260
I'm an editor, a fashion editor.

340
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,300
You're not even wearing pants.

341
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:44,630
I don't think this message
is for me.

342
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:45,430
Wait.

343
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:50,200
I am Ember,
you insolent little Janet.

344
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,010
There is no walking away.

345
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,280
Only doing what I say.
Quickly.

346
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:56,340
I'm telling you, I don't know...

347
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,510
Fix this now!

348
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:04,320
Fuck me.

349
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,290
Fuck it.

350
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,770
Okay.

351
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,560
What?

352
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,470
- What the...
- Fuck!

353
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,440
The color correction
on this model

354
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:57,970
is so bad, it's racist.

355
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,210
Set a call.

356
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,010
Did Dr. Liu call back?

357
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,050
Yes, he... he said that
all the tests were normal.

358
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,010
My eye is weird.

359
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:09,080
Colors are weird.

360
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,390
How is that normal, Sophie?

361
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:15,260
Well, uh, he suggested this,

362
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:17,390
and he says
he can see you next week

363
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,060
if the problem doesn't resolve.

364
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,530
Next week?

365
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,730
Perfect.

366
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,300
Well...

367
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:30,200
Now I've definitely seen
this year's ugliest accessory.

368
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,240
It... it was the only one
they had.

369
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,410
I'll deal with it.

370
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,640
It's fine.

371
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,710
Oh, and Sophie.

372
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,510
Mm-hmm?

373
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:40,380
Did you order
those books for me?

374
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,480
"Fillory and Further."

375
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,450
Oh, um, the Amazon account

376
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:45,420
locked me out, and... sorry, I...

377
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,220
I'm calling around,

378
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,790
but bookstores
are sold out of it.

379
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,490
I'll keep trying.

380
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,490
That was a lot of words.

381
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:54,130
Just get it done.

382
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,180
Hey!

383
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,180
What the hell?

384
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,720
Janet Pluchinsky?

385
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:21,120
- Am I under arrest?
- No.

386
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:25,160
Well, what's going on, then?

387
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:27,060
And why are you wearing
that ridiculous

388
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,100
spelling bee medal?

389
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,430
It's a magical amulet.

390
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:32,470
- Mm.
- Look, I am not crazy, okay?

391
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,570
There's something
you need to know,

392
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,000
and as soon as I start
telling you about this,

393
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,670
bad shit is gonna start
flying at our heads,

394
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:39,840
and this helps...

395
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,280
but not completely.

396
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,280
That makes no sense.

397
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,110
Would you just
keep your mind open

398
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:48,320
for two seconds, okay?

399
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:55,290
My name is Sam Cunningham.

400
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,830
I'm a narcotics officer
with the Seattle P.D.

401
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,330
Flip to chapter three.

402
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,300
It's your life.

403
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,070
And mine.

404
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,800
Look, this medal thing,

405
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,810
it has some sort of...
I don't know what to call it...

406
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,310
Like, a field of effect,

407
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,410
and it is bouncing shit
away from us.

408
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,140
- I'm sorry, do...
- Do you hear yourself?

409
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:20,150
Tell me things haven't
been weird for you lately.

410
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:23,320
- Well...
- Something was done to us.

411
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:26,550
This guy, he told me
that he is a witch,

412
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:29,290
and I know how that sounds,
but he was real.

413
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,290
And, okay... and I know
how that sounds.

414
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:32,830
Just spit it out.

415
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,530
He told me that I wasn't me.

416
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,500
That this...

417
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:38,700
wasn't my identity.

418
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:41,200
And then I found this.

419
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,870
Well, I've never heard
of this book.

420
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:45,210
It's super obscure,

421
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,270
but my whole life is in it.

422
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:50,610
My parents, the Academy,
my last shitty boyfriend.

423
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:52,450
"Janet Pluchinsky

424
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,850
had stabbed her way to
the accessory editor's desk."

425
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,020
That's a dumb way of putting it.

426
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:57,120
The writing isn't award-winning.

427
00:23:57,150 --> 00:23:59,720
And my boobs look insane
in this drawing.

428
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,360
A man wrote this, correct?

429
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:04,360
Correct, but the details.

430
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:07,260
Did you have a pet sugar glider
when you were eight?

431
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,200
Ate white cheddar popcorn
with Tabasco for breakfast?

432
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:13,570
You have a dedicated closet
for wigs and fetish underwear?

433
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:18,410
Come on!

434
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,780
It's okay.

435
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:26,410
What the hell?

436
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:27,720
I don't know, but there
are other characters

437
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,920
that are out there, too.

438
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:29,850
Look, I think we need
to find them.

439
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,550
Let's get the fuck out of here!

440
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,490
Come on!

441
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,960
Hey.

442
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:42,900
Hey.

443
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:45,570
I know you're not sleeping.

444
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,900
- Go away.
- Love to.

445
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,640
Locked in a cell.

446
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:52,710
Look, uh...

447
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,610
I'm not good at comforting...

448
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:59,910
But for what it's worth,
it's gonna be okay.

449
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:02,350
- No, don't lie.
- I'm not.

450
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,850
I've been where you are.

451
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:07,420
Did I ever tell you
why they locked me up?

452
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,920
Talking too much?

453
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,630
I was obsessed
with perfecting this spell.

454
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,700
You ever hear of Diogenes?

455
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:18,070
Yeah, sad-sack philosopher
with a lantern,

456
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,970
in search of one honest man.

457
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,370
I was finishing his work

458
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:25,870
to find good people.

459
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,270
Why?

460
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,910
Feel less alone.

461
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,780
Biggest obstacle being that

462
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:33,810
almost no good people exist.

463
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,550
Anyway, I kept refining it,

464
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:39,620
and I realized that
I had to focus on children,

465
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,760
because sometimes,

466
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,320
they're not rotten
to the core yet.

467
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,730
Anyway, that's all I wanted,

468
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,660
was to find some good kids,

469
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,230
and in some small way,
reward them.

470
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:55,640
Come to a point
where I needed this book.

471
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:56,470
Restricted.

472
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,040
They kept it in a place
they call, uh...

473
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,810
The poison room.

474
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:05,710
Yeah, killed one of my friends.

475
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,510
Yeah.

476
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:10,480
It killed some of mine, too.

477
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,920
I was working with
these elf gentlemen.

478
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,660
Uh, it was bad.

479
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:19,430
- Elves... elves are real?
- Sweet guys.

480
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,530
All that weird sex stuff
you hear about

481
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,330
is only partially true.

482
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:26,970
Anyway, the Library
came after me.

483
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,670
Possession, uh,
murder on Library property,

484
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:33,040
like... like I personally
murdered anyone.

485
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,780
Please.

486
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:36,840
Wait.

487
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,550
A spells that rewards
good children,

488
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,610
and you and your elves...

489
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,520
That was a long time ago.

490
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,650
Are you Santa Claus?

491
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,590
Well...

492
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:50,690
Well, I'm not, not that.

493
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:51,560
But I don't like that name.

494
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,790
It got very commercial,

495
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,830
very shopping-mall.

496
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,800
Look, just call me Nick,
asshole.

497
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:02,900
I tried to escape early on.

498
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,570
Ended up lost in the stacks.

499
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:06,870
They found me, of course,

500
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:09,040
and that's when I tried
to kill myself.

501
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:12,410
Really?

502
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:14,480
How... how did you cast
in your room?

503
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,450
- I can't do any magic.
- Of course you can't.

504
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:18,350
I mean, the entire cell
is coated with deadening paint.

505
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:20,020
I mean, you'd have
to scrape off an entire wall

506
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,720
- to get anywhere.
- How?

507
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:26,060
Uh, I did it
the old-fashioned way.

508
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:30,400
I pulled the edge
off of my food tray.

509
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:33,100
Well, the point is...

510
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,140
Is that I'm glad I'm not dead.

511
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,410
I'm not gonna die in here...

512
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,440
And neither are you.

513
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,510
We're both smart.

514
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:46,080
We'll figure it out.

515
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,480
Why do you care?

516
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,790
Okay.

517
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,590
Christmas 2004.

518
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,630
The pink diary that your parents

519
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:01,130
thought your brother got you
and vice versa...

520
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,160
Wait, are you saying
that that was you?

521
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,800
Alice, you are good.

522
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,900
You're nice.

523
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,870
Honestly, most kids
as smart as you

524
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:13,440
were naughty as shit.

525
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,110
I... I know...

526
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,440
you hurt people,

527
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,710
and you think that means
you should hurt...

528
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:24,620
but I know.

529
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:28,020
I know you are not a bad person.

530
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,030
Promise me.

531
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,630
Promise me you'll hang in there.

532
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,900
I promise...

533
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,040
Santa.

534
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:54,950
<i>- Hey! Help!
- Guard!</i>

535
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,420
Help! Help!

536
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:57,980
Alice!

537
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:58,790
Help!

538
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,550
Somebody, help!

539
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:02,490
Help me!
Over here!

540
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,090
Here! Alice!

541
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,390
Alice!

542
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,400
- Help! Help!
- Alice?

543
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,960
We need help in here!

544
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,700
Alice!
Help!

545
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,330
Alice.

546
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:24,240
I should have seen this coming.

547
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,740
You're here

548
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:29,040
because you knowingly broke
a contract with the Order.

549
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,080
Not for causing what happened
to your friends.

550
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:33,080
You didn't cause that.

551
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,120
They made their own choice.

552
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,750
I know...

553
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:41,760
Something about guilt.

554
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,130
You wonder why I care.

555
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:52,430
After all, you betrayed
the Order.

556
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:53,800
You probably think
I've singled you out

557
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,140
for punishment.

558
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:59,770
I did single you out.

559
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:02,140
For rehabilitation.

560
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:07,610
You have the makings
of a Master.

561
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:10,620
You could go further
than anyone, you know.

562
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:12,750
Fogg, your father,

563
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,320
Mayakovsky.

564
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,190
That can happen here.
There's work.

565
00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:21,490
Some in your situation
may be invited to participate,

566
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:23,300
and then...

567
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:25,230
this isn't a prison,

568
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,730
because what
could be more fulfilling

569
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:29,600
than immersion in the great
work of the Order?

570
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:35,140
I know you hate this place.

571
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,680
Given what you did
to those keys,

572
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:39,350
I gather you hate
magic itself, so...

573
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,850
I won't ask...

574
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:45,320
until you're ready.

575
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,360
I hope that day comes.

576
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:54,490
I'm also not going to let you
kill yourself.

577
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:55,900
Don't try that again.

578
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:59,530
The wounds should be healed.

579
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:02,200
Rona will bring you back
to your room.

580
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,400
I thought you were smart.

581
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,570
That was so stupid.

582
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,900
Sorry if I scared you.

583
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,370
No, you didn't scare me.

584
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,700
You disappointed
the shit out of me,

585
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,270
you histrionic little idiot.

586
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:42,210
I thought you were strong.

587
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,810
I don't know why
you would think that.

588
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:48,210
Uh, well, yeah, me neither.

589
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:49,750
Look, I wasn't trying
to kill myself.

590
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:50,980
Really?

591
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,650
Look, I was just trying
to figure out

592
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:54,590
a way out of here,
and I think that...

593
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,760
I... I just need to think.

594
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,720
Kim.

595
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:14,080
Have a seat.

596
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,090
Um...

597
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,390
I just wanted to talk to you
about my progress.

598
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,790
See, everyone got
their discipline today.

599
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:24,360
- Oh, yes.
- Always an interesting day.

600
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,360
Except for me.

601
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,670
I heard.

602
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,630
It's not super surprising,
given the fact

603
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:33,640
that I haven't been able
to do a single piece of magic.

604
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:36,240
Well, so far.

605
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:37,540
Heard that as well.

606
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:40,340
They're calling me a squib.

607
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,750
I even heard
Professor Lipson say it

608
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,580
when she thought
I was out of the room.

609
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,480
I'll talk to her about that.

610
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,250
We discourage that term.

611
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:51,590
It's considered hate speech.

612
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,490
I mean, but don't you agree?

613
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,430
Do you?

614
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,130
Well, I...

615
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,830
I mean, I think I got
the highest math scores

616
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,130
in the history
of my high school,

617
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:04,430
and I graduated Harvard
on my 19th birthday.

618
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:05,870
Who didn't?

619
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:10,270
I... I'm just saying, I...

620
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:12,540
Look, of course
I want to keep trying.

621
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,410
It's like...
the moment that I found out

622
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:20,350
- magic was real...
- Mm.

623
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:23,720
That was the moment
that I discovered who I am.

624
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:27,720
You remind me
of a young woman I once knew.

625
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,690
Similar tenacious mind.

626
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:33,600
I rejected her from Brakebills.

627
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:36,370
Why?

628
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,870
Suffice to say,

629
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:40,370
I had much evidence
I was doing the right thing,

630
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:42,940
but out on her own,

631
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:45,710
she got hurt, badly.

632
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:49,550
I had chosen not to protect her.

633
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,650
I'm simply not willing
to repeat that choice with you.

634
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:55,620
So...

635
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:58,590
Patience.

636
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,920
Magic is real.

637
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,760
Magic is real!

638
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,930
This is the trippiest thing
I have ever seen.

639
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:09,300
I gotta say, you're
taking this pretty well.

640
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:11,200
Well, you know,

641
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,670
it's all an illusion.

642
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,570
The Grand Maya.

643
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:16,810
Right, yeah.

644
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,780
The Grand Maya.
Of course, man.

645
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:20,410
Can I just say one thing?

646
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:22,280
- I cannot believe...
- Hey.

647
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:24,650
- You're DJ Hansel.
- Stay close, okay?

648
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,280
This medal thing,
it works better

649
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,320
- the closer you are.
- I've been listening

650
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,280
to your Taylor Swift remix
nonstop.

651
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,120
Is it true
that you guys hooked up?

652
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,390
Um, Janet?

653
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,320
- Sorry.
- You always do that.

654
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,660
I was just wondering

655
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:35,930
what you want me to say
about all these plane tickets.

656
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:38,700
I don't want you
to say anything.

657
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:40,830
I want you to expense them.

658
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:42,370
Oh, well, it's just that

659
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,630
they don't usually
allow so many.

660
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:46,440
Yeah, huge feature, okay?

661
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:48,870
- That's DJ Hansel.
- Hey, how you doing?

662
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:50,440
Yeah, these are his minions.

663
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,570
Put that, okay?

664
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,710
And lattes, Sophie,
from the other place.

665
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,510
You know, the one that...
The little thing I like.

666
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,610
- Okay, okay.
- Yeah, yeah, and...

667
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:58,520
And almond milk, please,
if you don't mind.

668
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,720
- She's young.
- I'm working with her.

669
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,350
You were working with her.

670
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,990
Now, who knows?

671
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:08,020
Who knows anything?

672
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:11,530
- Right, 'cause magic is real.
- You know?

673
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,630
Literally.

674
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:15,400
Like in movies,
except literally real.

675
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:18,270
So no one can find
Kim the architect;

676
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,970
Nigel, the bastard son
of a British lord,

677
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:23,040
was reported missing
by his family;

678
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:25,540
And, uh, Brian
the English professor,

679
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,440
also reported missing.

680
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,880
- Not worrying, not worrying.
- Or another way to look at it

681
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:30,710
is that the whole
goddamn thing is worrying

682
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,820
and no one thing
is any more or less worrying

683
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:34,320
than anything else.

684
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:35,850
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey, hey, hey.

685
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,490
You need breath work, man.

686
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:43,530
So how do we figure out
who we really...

687
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,930
Don't say it.

688
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,300
- Shh.
- Okay, just...

689
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:49,370
I don't know how we're supposed

690
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,300
to talk about this

691
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,600
if we're not allowed
to talk about this.

692
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,770
Yeah, I mean,
shouldn't all of us

693
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:57,370
being in a room together
be enough to...

694
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:58,510
- I don't know, I mean...
- Okay, look.

695
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:02,680
Apparently, you have to poke
the fake ID aspect

696
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:04,950
of the situation
pretty directly.

697
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,850
Okay, just talk around it, okay?

698
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:09,350
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

699
00:37:09,390 --> 00:37:13,820
I say we find the writer
of this comic book, right?

700
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:16,030
James Tyberius R. Martin
is clearly a penname,

701
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,730
but whoever he is,
maybe he knows something

702
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,400
- that can help us.
- Yeah, but...

703
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:20,500
But that written 14 years ago.

704
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:23,470
I mean, what does that
even mean?

705
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,740
Because I have memories
from before,

706
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:28,710
but they're not really mine
because I'm...

707
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,040
Uh, never mind!

708
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,910
Never mind, I said!

709
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:38,550
Oh, God.

710
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,950
You know, the guy
that got hit by a truck...

711
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:44,750
- Did he die?
- He's still in the hospital.

712
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:48,730
Well, if he's alive,

713
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,130
then we can ask him
some questions.

714
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,760
Oh, I wish you wouldn't.

715
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,470
I really feel
you've done enough for him.

716
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,900
Hi.

717
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,500
I'm Marina.

718
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:02,640
You almost killed
a good friend of mine

719
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,940
and stole that from him,
which he was borrowing.

720
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,410
So, really,
you stole it from me.

721
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:08,980
Okay, relax.

722
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:11,110
I'm here to help.

723
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,350
Are you even listening?

724
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,890
Yeah, of course.

725
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,390
Of course I am.

726
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,460
We should get you cleaned up.

727
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:25,460
You've got so much blood on you

728
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:27,960
from that boring waiter.

729
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,030
Anyway, we'll have to do it
once we get there.

730
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,760
We have to hurry now.

731
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,070
Where... where are we going?

732
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,070
Scoop of pistachio with jimmies.

733
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,110
- I said I wanted sprinkles.
- Jimmies are sprinkles.

734
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,910
No, stop, jimmies are sprinkles!

735
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:41,670
Ah!

736
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,650
Hmm, jimmies<i> are</i> sprinkles.

737
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,980
Anyway, Greece.
A temple.

738
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,050
He'll be there for his transit.

739
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:52,790
It's the only time to catch him.

740
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:55,760
Flay that bastard's flesh
clean off his bones.

741
00:38:57,530 --> 00:39:01,430
Oh, remind me to get a coat.

742
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,600
Am I remembering

743
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:06,570
you kill these little bodies
if you get them too cold?

744
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:10,370
Hey, is there another game
that we can play?

745
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:13,910
One where we don't flay anybody?

746
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,340
Oh, but he deserves it,

747
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,910
sad little man
we are calling Brian.

748
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:19,710
- Why? What did he do?
- He knows.

749
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:23,020
Just like how all your...

750
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:24,580
friends know too.

751
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:26,290
- Friends?
- What... what friends?

752
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,320
Oh, but we can't talk
about it, Brian-Not-Brian.

753
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,790
Your glamour gets very angry

754
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:32,960
if I even say your name
too much.

755
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:36,000
Look, it's better

756
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:38,030
you have no idea
what I'm talking about.

757
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:40,500
These friends,
I'm going to kill them,

758
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,470
and we have to assume

759
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,470
it's going to happen
in front of you.

760
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:47,110
It will hurt less
if you don't know who they are.

761
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,710
I like you.

762
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:11,730
Make yourselves at home.

763
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,470
- Nice digs.
- Thank you.

764
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:20,970
I worked really hard
to steal them.

765
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,790
What is that?

766
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:35,690
Protection.

767
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,460
From?

768
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:39,290
Whatever the hell's going on
with you people.

769
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:41,760
Well, I didn't say
you could move in.

770
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,300
Come on, let's go.

771
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,670
All right.

772
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,670
Well, we know it's big.

773
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,040
Big magic.

774
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:51,940
Wow, okay.

775
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:55,740
We know that you don't know
what the fuck it is.

776
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,180
That's fun.

777
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:59,180
And we know if we poke it,

778
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:01,910
it pokes us back with a truck.

779
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:05,550
Oh, wow.

780
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,520
Now I know how
the gold prospectors felt.

781
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,560
It's just dripping off you.

782
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:13,960
And you have no idea
what that means.

783
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,790
That's fine.

784
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:17,800
You're all just very, very,

785
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:20,930
extremely juiced up
on a level that's,

786
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:22,940
quite frankly,
not legal these days.

787
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:25,240
I'm just a little curious
how you all got like this.

788
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:27,340
You... you and us both.

789
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:31,940
Okay, let's take
a peek underneath

790
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,780
and see what you
really look like.

791
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,250
I don't think that
whatever that is...

792
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,080
Spell, illusion, charm,
whatever.

793
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,020
Yeah, I don't think
it's gonna let you.

794
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:39,120
Relax, sweetie.

795
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,790
This place is warded
up to the vag,

796
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,120
- and I'm very good...
- Hey.

797
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:45,260
At what I do.

798
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:48,630
Just hold still.

799
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,930
So you're like some powerful,

800
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:54,070
- benevolent white witch?
- Uh-huh.

801
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:55,900
Oh, well, that's good.

802
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:55,630
What in creation

803
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:58,830
is the matter with you,
High King?

804
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,300
Where to start with that?

805
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,740
This is out little game.

806
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:04,700
I have to ask you
to do things twice

807
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:07,970
because you're such
a handsome king.

808
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:10,040
Enough flirtation.

809
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:13,150
It's unseemly that a simulacrum
of this magnificence

810
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:15,920
should be bothered
so repeatedly.

811
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:17,280
Fix it.

812
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,820
Fix what?

813
00:43:19,850 --> 00:43:22,390
I don't know
what you want me to fix!

814
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:25,690
Whatever the matter is
in Fillory, you simple boy!

815
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:27,030
Find the bother.

816
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,160
Find it, fix it.

817
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,730
A, fuck you.

818
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:33,000
B, I'm not in Fillory.

819
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:33,900
What?

820
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,630
I'm in New York City,

821
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:37,900
along with everyone else
that matters.

822
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,100
Fillory is fiction.

823
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:42,110
- It's a kid's book.
- Why didn't you say so?

824
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:43,940
Time to wake up, High King.

825
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:46,280
Many blessings.

826
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,890
Guys?

827
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:00,830
Sam?

828
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,430
Hansel?

829
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:10,400
What the high holy Jesus freak?

830
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:15,110
Wake up. Wake up.

831
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:16,410
Wake up.

832
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,910
Wake the fuck up!

833
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:20,210
Wake up!

834
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,780
Fuck!

835
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:29,260
Hello?

836
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,960
Hello?
