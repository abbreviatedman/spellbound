1
00:00:06,745 --> 00:00:09,444
- Previously,
on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:09,487 --> 00:00:11,054
- I killed a god.
- The old gods--

3
00:00:11,098 --> 00:00:12,664
when we're harmless,
they ignore us,

4
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:14,101
but when we become malignant,
they amputate.

5
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:19,410
- Magic is gone.
- I need to show you something.

6
00:00:19,454 --> 00:00:20,759
- My God.

7
00:00:20,803 --> 00:00:23,197
- I have magic.

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,676
- Do you want your magic back
or not?

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,636
I'll send you
on an epic quest.

10
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:29,551
- "The Tale
of the Seven Keys."

11
00:00:29,594 --> 00:00:31,422
Jules, this is our quest.

12
00:00:33,555 --> 00:00:36,384
I think I'm leveling up.

13
00:00:38,864 --> 00:00:40,823
I'm...
- A full-on goddess.

14
00:00:40,866 --> 00:00:42,477
- You're here
about the fountain.

15
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,608
The backdoor to magic.

16
00:00:43,652 --> 00:00:45,306
- Alice, what are you doing?

17
00:00:45,349 --> 00:00:47,395
- She's destroying the keys!

18
00:00:47,438 --> 00:00:49,397
- I know you thought
this was for everyone's good.

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,268
You'll see someday it wasn't.

20
00:00:51,312 --> 00:00:52,748
- Julia, you could
lose your power.

21
00:00:57,144 --> 00:00:58,710
- Once magic is flowing again,

22
00:00:58,754 --> 00:01:02,236
you have 30 seconds
to attach the siphon.

23
00:01:04,586 --> 00:01:06,414
- I hear you have
an experimental potion

24
00:01:06,457 --> 00:01:08,372
that not only wipes
your memory,

25
00:01:08,416 --> 00:01:10,244
but creates
a whole new persona.

26
00:01:10,287 --> 00:01:11,767
- She made a deal with us,
then broke it.

27
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,770
Unlike the others,
she belongs to the Library.

28
00:01:14,813 --> 00:01:17,338
- That thing,
it can jump bodies.

29
00:01:17,381 --> 00:01:18,600
It's seen them.

30
00:01:18,643 --> 00:01:21,429
It knows magic is back.

31
00:01:21,472 --> 00:01:24,258
It knows they're magicians,
even if they don't.

32
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:25,259
If they don't know
who they are,

33
00:01:25,302 --> 00:01:26,390
if they don't have magic,

34
00:01:26,434 --> 00:01:27,391
they can't protect themselves.

35
00:01:27,435 --> 00:01:28,697
- Will you play with me?

36
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,785
- I think you've got me...

37
00:01:29,828 --> 00:01:31,221
mistaken for somebody else.

38
00:01:31,265 --> 00:01:32,614
- I think anything is more fun

39
00:01:32,657 --> 00:01:34,485
when you do it with a friend.

40
00:01:40,752 --> 00:01:42,450
- Feels like
there's never a reason

41
00:01:42,493 --> 00:01:43,799
to last that long.

42
00:01:45,496 --> 00:01:47,411
Um, I will catch you guys
tomorrow, yeah?

43
00:01:47,455 --> 00:01:48,717
Okay.

44
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:08,563
Shit!

45
00:02:12,436 --> 00:02:14,177
Shit.

46
00:02:15,265 --> 00:02:17,572
My God.

47
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,418
Shit.

48
00:03:19,851 --> 00:03:21,766
Hi.
Um, hello.

49
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:22,898
Hi.

50
00:03:25,074 --> 00:03:27,381
- Kimber D'Antoni?

51
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:38,305
I'm Todd.

52
00:03:38,348 --> 00:03:39,828
You're late.

53
00:03:39,871 --> 00:03:41,264
Follow me.

54
00:03:41,308 --> 00:03:43,701
- I--I'm sorry.
Where am I?

55
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:45,355
- Upstate New York.

56
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:46,922
Brakebills University.
- Okay, hold on. How--

57
00:03:46,965 --> 00:03:48,750
- Good afternoon.
Nice to see you.

58
00:03:48,793 --> 00:03:50,273
- How is that possible?
- Pro tip,

59
00:03:50,317 --> 00:03:51,666
in case you remember
any of this:

60
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:53,885
always be polite to Librarians.

61
00:03:53,929 --> 00:03:55,757
They look harmless,
but they do regulate

62
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,324
the good stuff, you know?

63
00:03:57,367 --> 00:03:58,934
Make them cranky,
all of a sudden,

64
00:03:58,977 --> 00:04:01,415
there's this lag time
when you put in a request.

65
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:04,026
I mean, New World Order,
definitely better than it was,

66
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:06,768
but in my humble "O," a little
worse than the old days.

67
00:04:06,811 --> 00:04:08,291
- Okay, stop.

68
00:04:08,335 --> 00:04:10,728
I'm sorry, what's happening?

69
00:04:10,772 --> 00:04:13,383
You've been offered
a preliminary exam

70
00:04:13,427 --> 00:04:15,820
for entry
into the graduate program.

71
00:04:15,864 --> 00:04:18,432
- Am I hallucinating?

72
00:04:18,475 --> 00:04:20,477
- I mean, if I say no,

73
00:04:20,521 --> 00:04:22,610
that could
be part of it, right?

74
00:04:22,653 --> 00:04:23,959
But, I mean, no.

75
00:04:24,002 --> 00:04:25,787
Um, really no. Nope.

76
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,354
- Okay, yeah.

77
00:04:27,397 --> 00:04:29,791
That definitely
wasn't helpful at all.

78
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:31,358
So...
- Sorry.

79
00:04:31,401 --> 00:04:33,360
Come on. We gotta hustle.

80
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:36,798
- Late!

81
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:40,802
Welcome.

82
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,459
You may address me as Dean.

83
00:04:46,634 --> 00:04:48,331
I know you all have questions.

84
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,595
They will be answered in time.

85
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:53,510
For the next hour,

86
00:04:53,554 --> 00:04:57,122
your task is to complete
your test.

87
00:04:58,907 --> 00:05:00,735
Best of luck to you all.

88
00:05:00,778 --> 00:05:02,954
Begin.

89
00:05:12,094 --> 00:05:13,617
- You know,
this would go faster

90
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:14,966
if we could just do them
all in one batch,

91
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:16,620
like we used to.

92
00:05:16,664 --> 00:05:19,406
- You know we don't have
that kind of supply.

93
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:21,495
- Yeah.
I'm just saying.

94
00:05:21,538 --> 00:05:24,454
I mean, how many extra hours
of our time is this taking,

95
00:05:24,498 --> 00:05:27,065
when the Library
could just give it to us?

96
00:05:27,109 --> 00:05:29,938
Come on.
You know you're thinking it.

97
00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:34,899
Well, looks like
the weird one's a dud.

98
00:05:40,731 --> 00:05:41,906
- Is the one you said--

99
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,168
- Shorted out the globe?

100
00:05:43,212 --> 00:05:44,866
Yeah.

101
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:46,650
Never seen that before.

102
00:05:48,609 --> 00:05:50,785
- It was late in the day, no?

103
00:05:50,828 --> 00:05:52,177
Supply runs low.

104
00:05:52,221 --> 00:05:53,875
Could be that.

105
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:55,093
- True.

106
00:05:55,137 --> 00:05:56,573
I'll pull her and wipe her

107
00:05:56,617 --> 00:05:58,749
as soon as she's done
the written portion.

108
00:06:01,883 --> 00:06:03,406
Damn it.

109
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,103
- What was that?

110
00:06:05,147 --> 00:06:06,975
- I'm not quite sure.
- Let me see--

111
00:06:07,018 --> 00:06:08,846
- I'd advise against it.

112
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:10,935
I didn't see anything.

113
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:13,677
I've got a splitting headache.

114
00:06:13,721 --> 00:06:15,113
- Okay.

115
00:06:15,157 --> 00:06:16,767
I'll take your word for it.

116
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:19,814
So keep or lose the migraine?
- Let's keep.

117
00:06:20,945 --> 00:06:22,904
For now.

118
00:06:48,146 --> 00:06:49,800
- Saw it with my own eyes.

119
00:06:49,844 --> 00:06:51,846
Periplaneta Americana.

120
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:53,456
Huge.
- Wow.

121
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,588
A cockroach can't be good
for the books.

122
00:06:54,631 --> 00:06:55,980
- Exactly.

123
00:06:56,024 --> 00:06:57,634
I'm thinking of posting a sign
to remind everyone

124
00:06:57,678 --> 00:06:58,940
that their mother
doesn't work here,

125
00:06:58,983 --> 00:07:01,159
and they should clean up
their own crumbs.

126
00:07:01,203 --> 00:07:02,770
- That's funny.
Very clever.

127
00:07:02,813 --> 00:07:04,075
- Thank you.

128
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:06,077
Should I use Helvetica
or Times New Roman?

129
00:07:06,121 --> 00:07:08,036
Would Comic Sans
communicate good cheer

130
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:10,560
or undercut the seriousness
of the message?

131
00:07:28,273 --> 00:07:31,059
- Even your breathing
is depressing today.

132
00:07:31,102 --> 00:07:32,495
You know that, Alice?

133
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:33,844
- Hey, I have an idea.

134
00:07:33,888 --> 00:07:35,846
- Yeah?
- Yeah, go fuck yourself.

135
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,587
I'm not here
to entertain you.

136
00:07:38,632 --> 00:07:41,199
If you say so.

137
00:07:41,243 --> 00:07:43,114
'Cause the other day,
when you tried to escape,

138
00:07:43,158 --> 00:07:44,551
that was funny.

139
00:07:44,594 --> 00:07:46,640
All that kicking and shrieking.

140
00:07:46,683 --> 00:07:48,772
Gives me a big chuckle
every time I think of it.

141
00:07:54,952 --> 00:07:56,084
- Good day, Ms. Quinn.

142
00:07:56,127 --> 00:07:57,215
Lunch.

143
00:07:59,217 --> 00:08:01,002
- I thought you had slaves
for that.

144
00:08:01,045 --> 00:08:02,960
- Junior Librarians.

145
00:08:04,266 --> 00:08:06,224
I must insist you eat today.

146
00:08:06,268 --> 00:08:08,966
- Fine. Insist away.

147
00:08:15,146 --> 00:08:16,800
You nosy bitch.

148
00:08:16,844 --> 00:08:18,541
Excuse me?

149
00:08:18,585 --> 00:08:20,021
- You read my book?

150
00:08:20,064 --> 00:08:22,240
Right up to the great
blank spot.

151
00:08:22,284 --> 00:08:25,156
Did you read that whole
chapter?

152
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,028
You wanna talk about
all the positions

153
00:08:27,071 --> 00:08:28,595
Quentin and I were in?

154
00:08:30,074 --> 00:08:32,816
Did my book tell you
how many times I came?

155
00:08:33,817 --> 00:08:35,340
- I can't let you starve,

156
00:08:35,384 --> 00:08:37,734
and I don't want
to force you to eat.

157
00:08:37,778 --> 00:08:39,649
Neither of us would enjoy that.

158
00:08:48,005 --> 00:08:50,094
Keep cooperating,
and you may continue to receive

159
00:08:50,138 --> 00:08:53,010
approved reading material.

160
00:08:56,013 --> 00:08:57,885
- Wait.

161
00:08:57,928 --> 00:08:59,713
I have a question.

162
00:09:01,018 --> 00:09:02,367
- I'm sorry.

163
00:09:02,411 --> 00:09:04,587
Dean Fogg's not coming.

164
00:09:15,076 --> 00:09:16,643
Dean Fogg.

165
00:09:16,686 --> 00:09:17,905
The new students?

166
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:19,907
Appreciate you coming

167
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:21,691
all the way here
to deliver this.

168
00:09:21,735 --> 00:09:24,781
- Yes, well, you did--
what's the word?

169
00:09:24,825 --> 00:09:26,740
Mandate that I do so.

170
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,828
- A formality.

171
00:09:27,871 --> 00:09:28,916
We have the utmost faith

172
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,091
in your selection methods.

173
00:09:30,134 --> 00:09:32,136
This is merely for our records.

174
00:09:35,313 --> 00:09:37,141
- This one.

175
00:09:37,185 --> 00:09:39,840
Professor Lipson reported
she caused an unusual reaction

176
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:41,406
on your globe.

177
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:43,104
Do you know why?

178
00:09:43,147 --> 00:09:45,062
- I'm sure it'll become clear.

179
00:09:45,106 --> 00:09:46,716
She shows great potential.

180
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,065
- In what way?

181
00:09:48,979 --> 00:09:51,199
- I'm not sure yet,

182
00:09:51,242 --> 00:09:54,202
but that's why
she's at Brakebills.

183
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,074
- Well, I trust your instinct.

184
00:09:57,118 --> 00:09:58,119
Approved.

185
00:09:58,162 --> 00:09:59,207
Always a pleasure.

186
00:10:03,472 --> 00:10:04,821
Alice is fine.

187
00:10:04,865 --> 00:10:07,955
Depressed, surly.

188
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:09,783
Still asking to see you again.

189
00:10:09,826 --> 00:10:13,395
- She's fixated on the thing
she says she saw in the castle.

190
00:10:13,438 --> 00:10:14,788
- You told her, didn't you?

191
00:10:14,831 --> 00:10:16,093
- That your
independent contractors

192
00:10:16,137 --> 00:10:18,443
are looking into the threat,
yes,

193
00:10:18,487 --> 00:10:21,098
but she's not worried
about mass destruction.

194
00:10:21,142 --> 00:10:22,839
She's worried
about her friends.

195
00:10:22,883 --> 00:10:25,712
- I can't think of anyone
better protected than they.

196
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:32,457
- ♪ Ooh-ooh

197
00:10:32,501 --> 00:10:34,285
- Let's be frank, Zelda.

198
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:36,810
My students saved magic.

199
00:10:36,853 --> 00:10:39,073
The world may throw flowers
at the feet of the Order

200
00:10:39,116 --> 00:10:40,727
and Irene McAllistair,

201
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,381
but you and I both know
the goddamn truth.

202
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:45,993
- The Order stepped into
an oversight position.

203
00:10:46,036 --> 00:10:48,430
Everything we do
is to preserve knowledge,

204
00:10:48,473 --> 00:10:49,823
to make things safer.

205
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:51,694
- I'm not arguing the benefits.

206
00:10:51,738 --> 00:10:53,827
- But you are,
because they come at a cost.

207
00:10:55,219 --> 00:10:57,308
Bottom line:
if your students resurface,

208
00:10:57,352 --> 00:10:59,354
I can't stop Irene
from doing what she will

209
00:10:59,397 --> 00:11:00,921
to ensure their silence.

210
00:11:00,964 --> 00:11:02,749
We have certain...

211
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:04,751
agreements with her as well.

212
00:11:07,797 --> 00:11:09,756
So...

213
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:12,846
they must stay where they are,
as they are.

214
00:11:13,803 --> 00:11:14,848
They'll be fine.

215
00:11:14,891 --> 00:11:17,328
Your spellwork was...

216
00:11:17,372 --> 00:11:18,895
masterful.

217
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:23,421
- You know my one solace,
Zelda?

218
00:11:23,465 --> 00:11:25,380
When my attempts
to protect them

219
00:11:25,423 --> 00:11:27,295
inevitably fail,

220
00:11:27,338 --> 00:11:30,472
their blood
will be on your hands.

221
00:11:33,562 --> 00:11:37,044
- ♪ Take your time with me

222
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:41,439
♪ I need to feel alive

223
00:11:46,923 --> 00:11:49,317
- Have a good day, Zelda.

224
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,723
- Don't tell me to relax.
I'm pissed.

225
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:06,726
- Okay.
I get it.

226
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:08,945
But you're overreacting.
- I should throw this at you.

227
00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:10,425
- Sam, come on.

228
00:12:10,468 --> 00:12:11,861
You made three
very strong arrests.

229
00:12:11,905 --> 00:12:14,734
- And this douchewater
just walks away,

230
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:15,865
based on what?

231
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:17,432
Explain that to me.

232
00:12:17,475 --> 00:12:19,651
- That douchewater
always gets away.

233
00:12:19,695 --> 00:12:20,957
- What are you talking about?

234
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:22,567
- Seen him booked six times.

235
00:12:22,611 --> 00:12:23,917
Never sticks.

236
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,745
Hey, what can I say?
Some people are lucky.

237
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:27,616
Or their lawyers are.

238
00:12:27,659 --> 00:12:29,444
My advice is, let it go.

239
00:13:14,881 --> 00:13:17,840
- Excuse me, miss?

240
00:13:17,884 --> 00:13:20,538
Can I help you?

241
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,087
- That guy.

242
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,479
He was just here.

243
00:13:48,523 --> 00:13:50,177
- I must not have heard.

244
00:13:56,531 --> 00:13:58,576
- Have a good day, sir.

245
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:33,611
"Hedge witch."

246
00:14:33,655 --> 00:14:35,657
Shit.

247
00:14:41,097 --> 00:14:42,969
Come on.

248
00:14:44,144 --> 00:14:46,015
Piece of shit.

249
00:14:54,632 --> 00:14:56,547
Damn it.

250
00:14:56,591 --> 00:14:58,941
Get your shit together,
Cunningham.

251
00:15:04,164 --> 00:15:06,035
Shit!

252
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,994
Of course.

253
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,753
- Hi, Mark.
- Listen, I know you're a cop.

254
00:16:11,796 --> 00:16:14,234
- Yeah, and, 
I know what you are.

255
00:16:14,277 --> 00:16:15,800
- I was just, leaving.

256
00:16:15,844 --> 00:16:17,019
- Yeah, I've noticed
you're good at that.

257
00:16:17,063 --> 00:16:19,065
Six arrests,
nothing ever sticks.

258
00:16:19,108 --> 00:16:21,110
- Look, I don't hurt anyone.
It's all strictly side hustle.

259
00:16:21,154 --> 00:16:22,894
- Cut the shit.

260
00:16:22,938 --> 00:16:24,766
I know there's more of you.

261
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:25,941
That you call yourself, what?
Hedge witches?

262
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,206
What the hell?

263
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,730
- I'm not stealing anything
that's gonna hurt anyone.

264
00:16:32,774 --> 00:16:34,558
Minor shit.
Charms, enhancements.

265
00:16:34,602 --> 00:16:36,778
Nothing dark and--look,
I have no interest

266
00:16:36,821 --> 00:16:39,172
in poking whatever kind
of witness-protection spell

267
00:16:39,215 --> 00:16:40,912
you've got going, okay?

268
00:16:40,956 --> 00:16:42,914
That thing tried to kill me
for looking at it.

269
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,004
- What are you talking about?

270
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:46,744
Charms, enchantments.

271
00:16:46,788 --> 00:16:48,659
What, is that French
for "crystal meth"?

272
00:16:50,357 --> 00:16:51,923
- You have no idea, do you?

273
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,317
You just think you're you.

274
00:16:54,361 --> 00:16:55,884
- Not so fast.

275
00:16:55,927 --> 00:16:57,190
What is that?

276
00:16:57,233 --> 00:16:58,582
Spelling bee medal?

277
00:16:58,626 --> 00:17:00,367
- Give that back.
- What is it?

278
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,195
- Protection.

279
00:17:02,238 --> 00:17:03,196
- From?

280
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:04,719
- You.

281
00:17:04,762 --> 00:17:05,850
- Wait, stop!

282
00:17:17,514 --> 00:17:19,647
- Yoo-hoo!

283
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,823
Arise, Your Majesty.

284
00:17:21,866 --> 00:17:23,955
Arise.

285
00:17:40,407 --> 00:17:43,192
- What the hell?

286
00:17:49,242 --> 00:17:52,680
- You may approach,
High King.

287
00:17:52,723 --> 00:17:53,855
Come, come.

288
00:17:53,898 --> 00:17:55,465
Let's take a look at you.

289
00:17:59,904 --> 00:18:02,168
- Hi.

290
00:18:02,211 --> 00:18:04,648
What the fuck is going on?

291
00:18:04,692 --> 00:18:06,737
- It's a little bit
worrying

292
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:08,739
that you don't seem
to know, considering.

293
00:18:08,783 --> 00:18:10,785
- "Considering"?

294
00:18:10,828 --> 00:18:13,266
Are those horns?

295
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:14,745
Wait.

296
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:18,358
Am I at Jeff Goldblum's house
right now?

297
00:18:18,401 --> 00:18:19,533
What did I take?

298
00:18:19,576 --> 00:18:21,361
- You are asleep.

299
00:18:21,404 --> 00:18:24,320
I, Ember,
greatest ever God of Fillory,

300
00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:26,322
am blessing a visitation
of my person

301
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:29,282
on your prone
and receptive state.

302
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:31,414
Well, more technically,

303
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:34,461
I, an energetic emanation

304
00:18:34,504 --> 00:18:36,680
previously placed here
by the great God Ember,

305
00:18:36,724 --> 00:18:38,987
have been activated
to contact you.

306
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,467
- "Activated."

307
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,382
- Activated,

308
00:18:42,425 --> 00:18:46,647
by a disturbance
of great magnitude.

309
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:49,693
Alarums, Majesty!

310
00:18:49,737 --> 00:18:51,739
I have emanated to warn you.

311
00:18:51,782 --> 00:18:54,568
Great ill is afoot.

312
00:18:54,611 --> 00:18:56,352
- Okay.

313
00:18:56,396 --> 00:18:59,225
We're gonna have to take this
from the top, all right?

314
00:18:59,268 --> 00:19:01,009
Because I literally haven't
been this confused

315
00:19:01,052 --> 00:19:03,403
since the time I woke up
in bed with Banksy.

316
00:19:03,446 --> 00:19:04,621
- This is concerning.

317
00:19:04,665 --> 00:19:05,927
- Which part?

318
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,408
- For one thing,
you look awfully like...

319
00:19:08,451 --> 00:19:10,410
a female.

320
00:19:10,453 --> 00:19:11,846
It's chilling.

321
00:19:11,889 --> 00:19:13,543
No matter.

322
00:19:13,587 --> 00:19:16,024
You must get to work
immediately, High King.

323
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:17,808
- Great, sure.

324
00:19:17,852 --> 00:19:18,940
Work on?

325
00:19:18,983 --> 00:19:21,421
- Well, this glorious emanation

326
00:19:21,464 --> 00:19:23,858
can only be triggered
by world war,

327
00:19:23,901 --> 00:19:26,426
pandemic, arrival of hostile

328
00:19:26,469 --> 00:19:29,298
or uninvited gods
onto Fillorian soil,

329
00:19:29,342 --> 00:19:32,258
revolt of dwarves,
or mass rising of the dead.

330
00:19:32,301 --> 00:19:35,043
Not sure they'd be able
to do much, the dead.

331
00:19:35,086 --> 00:19:37,088
They're sort of feeble
and rotting.

332
00:19:37,132 --> 00:19:38,829
It just struck me as creepy,

333
00:19:38,873 --> 00:19:40,962
and I'd rather you put
a stop to it.

334
00:19:41,005 --> 00:19:43,660
- Okay, horn person?

335
00:19:43,704 --> 00:19:45,488
My name is Janet.

336
00:19:45,532 --> 00:19:46,794
I'm not a king.

337
00:19:46,837 --> 00:19:48,578
I'm an editor,
a fashion editor.

338
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:49,927
You're not even wearing pants.

339
00:19:49,971 --> 00:19:51,973
I don't think this message
is for me.

340
00:19:52,016 --> 00:19:53,104
- Wait.

341
00:19:53,931 --> 00:19:57,544
I am Ember,
you insolent little Janet.

342
00:19:57,587 --> 00:19:59,328
There is no walking away.

343
00:19:59,372 --> 00:20:01,722
Only doing what I say.
Quickly.

344
00:20:01,765 --> 00:20:03,680
- I'm telling you,
I don't know--

345
00:20:03,724 --> 00:20:05,856
- Fix this now!

346
00:20:09,512 --> 00:20:11,688
- Fuck me.

347
00:20:18,086 --> 00:20:19,653
Fuck it.

348
00:20:22,873 --> 00:20:25,136
Okay.

349
00:20:48,725 --> 00:20:50,901
What?

350
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,822
- What the...
- Fuck!

351
00:21:00,911 --> 00:21:02,783
The color correction
on this model

352
00:21:02,826 --> 00:21:05,133
is so bad, it's racist.

353
00:21:05,176 --> 00:21:07,527
Set a call.

354
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,137
Did Dr. Liu call back?

355
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,358
- Yes, he--he said that
all the tests were normal.

356
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:14,185
- My eye is weird.

357
00:21:14,229 --> 00:21:16,405
Colors are weird.

358
00:21:16,449 --> 00:21:18,712
How is that normal, Sophie?

359
00:21:18,755 --> 00:21:22,585
- Well, he suggested this,

360
00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:24,718
and he says
he can see you next week

361
00:21:24,761 --> 00:21:26,372
if the problem doesn't resolve.

362
00:21:26,415 --> 00:21:27,851
- Next week?

363
00:21:27,895 --> 00:21:30,114
Perfect.

364
00:21:31,986 --> 00:21:33,640
Well...

365
00:21:33,683 --> 00:21:37,557
Now I've definitely seen
this year's ugliest accessory.

366
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,559
- It--it was the only one
they had.

367
00:21:39,602 --> 00:21:40,734
- I'll deal with it.

368
00:21:40,777 --> 00:21:41,996
It's fine.

369
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:44,085
And Sophie.

370
00:21:45,956 --> 00:21:47,741
- Did you order
those books for me?

371
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,091
"Fillory and Further."

372
00:21:50,134 --> 00:21:51,788
- Um, the Amazon account

373
00:21:51,832 --> 00:21:53,094
locked me out, and--
sorry, I--

374
00:21:53,137 --> 00:21:54,574
I'm calling around,

375
00:21:54,617 --> 00:21:56,140
but bookstores
are sold out of it.

376
00:21:56,184 --> 00:21:57,838
I'll keep trying.

377
00:21:57,881 --> 00:21:59,840
- That was a lot of words.

378
00:21:59,883 --> 00:22:01,494
Just get it done.

379
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:21,514
Hey!

380
00:22:21,557 --> 00:22:23,516
What the hell?

381
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:25,082
- Janet Pluchinsky?

382
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:28,477
- Am I under arrest?
- No.

383
00:22:30,087 --> 00:22:32,481
- Well, what's going on, then?

384
00:22:32,525 --> 00:22:34,222
And why are you wearing
that ridiculous

385
00:22:34,265 --> 00:22:35,223
spelling bee medal?

386
00:22:35,266 --> 00:22:36,790
- It's a magical amulet.

387
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:39,793
Look, I am not crazy, okay?

388
00:22:39,836 --> 00:22:41,185
There's something
you need to know,

389
00:22:41,229 --> 00:22:42,970
and as soon as I start
telling you about this,

390
00:22:43,013 --> 00:22:45,146
bad shit is gonna start
flying at our heads,

391
00:22:45,189 --> 00:22:47,191
and this helps...

392
00:22:47,235 --> 00:22:48,628
but not completely.

393
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,587
- That makes no sense.

394
00:22:51,631 --> 00:22:53,284
- Would you just
keep your mind open

395
00:22:53,328 --> 00:22:55,678
for two seconds, okay?

396
00:22:59,682 --> 00:23:02,642
- My name is Sam Cunningham.

397
00:23:02,685 --> 00:23:05,209
I'm a narcotics officer
with the Seattle P.D.

398
00:23:06,776 --> 00:23:08,691
Flip to chapter three.

399
00:23:09,997 --> 00:23:11,607
It's your life.

400
00:23:12,652 --> 00:23:13,609
And mine.

401
00:23:14,915 --> 00:23:17,134
Look, this medal thing,

402
00:23:17,178 --> 00:23:20,137
it has some sort of--
I don't know what to call it--

403
00:23:20,181 --> 00:23:21,617
like, a field of effect,

404
00:23:21,661 --> 00:23:23,010
and it is bouncing shit
away from us.

405
00:23:23,053 --> 00:23:25,186
- I'm sorry, do--
do you hear yourself?

406
00:23:25,229 --> 00:23:27,318
- Tell me things haven't
been weird for you lately.

407
00:23:27,362 --> 00:23:30,626
- Well...
- Something was done to us.

408
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:33,890
This guy, he told me
that he is a witch,

409
00:23:33,934 --> 00:23:36,632
and I know how that sounds,
but he was real.

410
00:23:36,676 --> 00:23:38,678
And, okay--and I know
how that sounds.

411
00:23:38,721 --> 00:23:40,201
- Just spit it out.

412
00:23:40,244 --> 00:23:41,855
- He told me that I wasn't me.

413
00:23:41,898 --> 00:23:43,813
That this...

414
00:23:43,857 --> 00:23:46,033
wasn't my identity.

415
00:23:46,076 --> 00:23:48,514
And then I found this.

416
00:23:48,557 --> 00:23:50,211
- Well, I've never heard
of this book.

417
00:23:50,254 --> 00:23:52,518
- It's super obscure,

418
00:23:52,561 --> 00:23:54,607
but my whole life is in it.

419
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:57,958
My parents, the Academy,
my last shitty boyfriend.

420
00:23:58,001 --> 00:23:59,786
- "Janet Pluchinsky

421
00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:02,179
had stabbed her way to
the accessory editor's desk."

422
00:24:02,223 --> 00:24:03,616
That's a dumb way
of putting it.

423
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:05,008
- The writing
isn't award-winning.

424
00:24:05,052 --> 00:24:07,054
- And my boobs look insane
in this drawing.

425
00:24:07,097 --> 00:24:08,708
A man wrote this, correct?

426
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:11,711
- Correct, but the details.

427
00:24:11,754 --> 00:24:14,583
Did you have a pet sugar glider
when you were eight?

428
00:24:14,627 --> 00:24:17,368
Ate white cheddar popcorn
with Tabasco for breakfast?

429
00:24:17,412 --> 00:24:20,894
You have a dedicated closet
for wigs and fetish underwear?

430
00:24:24,071 --> 00:24:25,725
Come on!

431
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:29,119
It's okay.

432
00:24:31,295 --> 00:24:33,733
What the hell?

433
00:24:33,776 --> 00:24:35,038
- I don't know, but there
are other characters

434
00:24:35,082 --> 00:24:36,344
that are out there, too.

435
00:24:36,387 --> 00:24:37,693
Look, I think we need
to find them.

436
00:24:38,955 --> 00:24:39,913
- Let's get
the fuck out of here!

437
00:24:39,956 --> 00:24:40,957
Come on!

438
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,354
- Hey.

439
00:24:48,878 --> 00:24:50,227
Hey.

440
00:24:50,271 --> 00:24:52,926
I know you're not sleeping.

441
00:24:52,969 --> 00:24:55,232
- Go away.
- Love to.

442
00:24:55,276 --> 00:24:57,974
Locked in a cell.

443
00:24:58,018 --> 00:25:00,107
Look...

444
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,979
I'm not good at comforting...

445
00:25:04,154 --> 00:25:07,331
But for what it's worth,
it's gonna be okay.

446
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:09,682
- No, don't lie.
- I'm not.

447
00:25:09,725 --> 00:25:11,205
I've been where you are.

448
00:25:11,248 --> 00:25:14,774
Did I ever tell you
why they locked me up?

449
00:25:14,817 --> 00:25:16,297
- Talking too much?

450
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:19,953
- I was obsessed
with perfecting this spell.

451
00:25:19,996 --> 00:25:22,042
You ever hear of Diogenes?

452
00:25:22,085 --> 00:25:25,393
- Yeah, sad-sack philosopher
with a lantern,

453
00:25:25,436 --> 00:25:28,309
in search of one honest man.

454
00:25:28,352 --> 00:25:30,703
- I was finishing his work

455
00:25:30,746 --> 00:25:33,227
to find good people.

456
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,445
- Why?

457
00:25:34,489 --> 00:25:36,273
- Feel less alone.

458
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,102
Biggest obstacle being that

459
00:25:39,146 --> 00:25:41,191
almost no good people exist.

460
00:25:42,192 --> 00:25:43,890
Anyway, I kept refining it,

461
00:25:43,933 --> 00:25:46,936
and I realized that
I had to focus on children,

462
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,330
because sometimes,

463
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:51,680
they're not rotten
to the core yet.

464
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:55,075
Anyway, that's all I wanted,

465
00:25:55,118 --> 00:25:56,990
was to find some good kids,

466
00:25:57,033 --> 00:25:59,819
and in some small way,
reward them.

467
00:25:59,862 --> 00:26:02,952
Come to a point
where I needed this book.

468
00:26:02,996 --> 00:26:03,866
Restricted.

469
00:26:05,738 --> 00:26:07,391
They kept it in a place
they call--

470
00:26:07,435 --> 00:26:10,177
- The poison room.

471
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,049
Yeah, killed one of my friends.

472
00:26:13,093 --> 00:26:14,834
- Yeah.

473
00:26:14,877 --> 00:26:17,793
It killed some of mine, too.

474
00:26:17,837 --> 00:26:21,362
I was working with
these elf gentlemen.

475
00:26:21,405 --> 00:26:24,017
It was bad.

476
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,759
- Elves--elves are real?
- Sweet guys.

477
00:26:26,802 --> 00:26:28,848
All that weird sex stuff
you hear about

478
00:26:28,891 --> 00:26:30,501
is only partially true.

479
00:26:30,545 --> 00:26:34,331
Anyway, the Library
came after me.

480
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:38,031
Possession, 
murder on Library property,

481
00:26:38,074 --> 00:26:40,381
like--like I personally
murdered anyone.

482
00:26:40,424 --> 00:26:42,122
Please.

483
00:26:42,165 --> 00:26:44,167
- Wait.

484
00:26:44,211 --> 00:26:45,865
A spells that rewards
good children,

485
00:26:45,908 --> 00:26:46,953
and you and your elves...

486
00:26:46,996 --> 00:26:48,868
- That was a long time ago.

487
00:26:49,782 --> 00:26:52,001
Are you Santa Claus?

488
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:54,917
- Well...

489
00:26:54,961 --> 00:26:58,051
Well, I'm not, not that.

490
00:26:58,094 --> 00:26:59,182
But I don't like that name.

491
00:26:59,226 --> 00:27:00,227
It got very commercial,

492
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,185
very shopping-mall.

493
00:27:03,186 --> 00:27:05,145
Look, just call me Nick,
asshole.

494
00:27:07,016 --> 00:27:10,237
- I tried to escape early on.

495
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,891
Ended up lost in the stacks.

496
00:27:11,934 --> 00:27:14,197
They found me, of course,

497
00:27:14,241 --> 00:27:16,417
and that's when I tried
to kill myself.

498
00:27:17,461 --> 00:27:19,725
- Really?

499
00:27:19,768 --> 00:27:21,814
How--how did you cast
in your room?

500
00:27:21,857 --> 00:27:23,772
I can't do any magic.
- Of course you can't.

501
00:27:23,816 --> 00:27:25,513
I mean, the entire cell
is coated with deadening paint.

502
00:27:25,556 --> 00:27:27,428
I mean, you'd have
to scrape off an entire wall

503
00:27:27,471 --> 00:27:30,039
to get anywhere.
- How?

504
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:33,477
- I did it
the old-fashioned way.

505
00:27:33,521 --> 00:27:37,525
I pulled the edge
off of my food tray.

506
00:27:37,568 --> 00:27:40,484
Well, the point is...

507
00:27:41,485 --> 00:27:43,531
Is that I'm glad I'm not dead.

508
00:27:45,141 --> 00:27:47,753
I'm not gonna die in here...

509
00:27:47,796 --> 00:27:49,755
And neither are you.

510
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:51,844
We're both smart.

511
00:27:51,887 --> 00:27:53,497
We'll figure it out.

512
00:27:55,499 --> 00:27:57,806
- Why do you care?

513
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:59,155
- Okay.

514
00:28:00,635 --> 00:28:03,943
Christmas 2004.

515
00:28:03,986 --> 00:28:05,988
The pink diary
that your parents

516
00:28:06,032 --> 00:28:08,469
thought your brother got you
and vice versa...

517
00:28:08,512 --> 00:28:10,514
- Wait, are you saying
that that was you?

518
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:14,127
- Alice, you are good.

519
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:16,259
You're nice.

520
00:28:16,303 --> 00:28:18,218
Honestly, most kids
as smart as you

521
00:28:18,261 --> 00:28:20,611
were naughty as shit.

522
00:28:20,655 --> 00:28:22,439
I--I know...

523
00:28:22,483 --> 00:28:24,833
you hurt people,

524
00:28:24,877 --> 00:28:28,054
and you think that means
you should hurt...

525
00:28:28,097 --> 00:28:31,971
but I know.

526
00:28:32,014 --> 00:28:35,365
I know you are not
a bad person.

527
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:40,370
Promise me.

528
00:28:40,414 --> 00:28:43,983
Promise me
you'll hang in there.

529
00:28:48,204 --> 00:28:50,250
- I promise...

530
00:28:52,513 --> 00:28:54,384
Santa.

531
00:29:00,826 --> 00:29:02,523
- Hey! Help!
Guard!

532
00:29:02,566 --> 00:29:04,177
Help! Help!

533
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,526
Alice!

534
00:29:05,569 --> 00:29:06,527
Help!

535
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:08,311
Somebody, help!

536
00:29:08,355 --> 00:29:10,226
Help me!
Over here!

537
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:12,838
Here! Alice!

538
00:29:12,881 --> 00:29:14,143
Alice!

539
00:29:14,187 --> 00:29:16,145
Help! Help!
- Alice?

540
00:29:16,189 --> 00:29:17,538
We need help in here!

541
00:29:17,581 --> 00:29:19,453
Alice!
Help!

542
00:29:19,496 --> 00:29:21,107
Alice.

543
00:30:29,523 --> 00:30:31,960
- I should have
seen this coming.

544
00:30:32,004 --> 00:30:33,483
You're here

545
00:30:33,527 --> 00:30:36,617
because you knowingly broke
a contract with the Order.

546
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,662
Not for causing what happened
to your friends.

547
00:30:38,706 --> 00:30:40,664
You didn't cause that.

548
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:42,884
They made their own choice.

549
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:45,539
I know...

550
00:30:47,106 --> 00:30:49,543
Something about guilt.

551
00:30:56,028 --> 00:30:57,899
You wonder why I care.

552
00:30:57,943 --> 00:31:00,206
After all, you betrayed
the Order.

553
00:31:00,249 --> 00:31:01,555
You probably think
I've singled you out

554
00:31:01,598 --> 00:31:02,904
for punishment.

555
00:31:05,341 --> 00:31:07,517
I did single you out.

556
00:31:07,561 --> 00:31:09,911
For rehabilitation.

557
00:31:11,521 --> 00:31:15,395
You have the makings
of a Master.

558
00:31:15,438 --> 00:31:18,398
You could go further
than anyone, you know.

559
00:31:18,441 --> 00:31:20,574
Fogg, your father,

560
00:31:20,617 --> 00:31:22,097
Mayakovsky.

561
00:31:23,098 --> 00:31:26,145
That can happen here.
There's work.

562
00:31:26,188 --> 00:31:29,235
Some in your situation
may be invited to participate,

563
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:31,019
and then...

564
00:31:31,063 --> 00:31:32,978
this isn't a prison,

565
00:31:33,021 --> 00:31:34,501
because what
could be more fulfilling

566
00:31:34,544 --> 00:31:37,373
than immersion in the great
work of the Order?

567
00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:42,726
I know you hate this place.

568
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,424
Given what you did
to those keys,

569
00:31:44,467 --> 00:31:47,122
I gather you hate
magic itself, so...

570
00:31:48,384 --> 00:31:49,646
I won't ask...

571
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,085
until you're ready.

572
00:31:55,304 --> 00:31:57,132
I hope that day comes.

573
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,224
I'm also not going to let you
kill yourself.

574
00:32:02,268 --> 00:32:03,704
Don't try that again.

575
00:32:05,401 --> 00:32:07,273
The wounds should be healed.

576
00:32:07,316 --> 00:32:09,971
Rona will bring you back
to your room.

577
00:32:35,736 --> 00:32:38,130
- I thought you were smart.

578
00:32:38,173 --> 00:32:40,306
That was so stupid.

579
00:32:40,349 --> 00:32:41,655
- Sorry if I scared you.

580
00:32:41,698 --> 00:32:43,135
- No, you didn't scare me.

581
00:32:43,178 --> 00:32:45,485
You disappointed
the shit out of me,

582
00:32:45,528 --> 00:32:48,009
you histrionic little idiot.

583
00:32:48,053 --> 00:32:49,750
I thought you were strong.

584
00:32:49,793 --> 00:32:52,666
- I don't know why
you would think that.

585
00:32:52,709 --> 00:32:55,799
- Well, yeah, me neither.

586
00:32:55,843 --> 00:32:57,497
- Look, I wasn't trying
to kill myself.

587
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,020
- Really?

588
00:32:59,064 --> 00:33:00,413
- Look, I was just trying
to figure out

589
00:33:00,456 --> 00:33:02,371
a way out of here,
and I think that...

590
00:33:09,074 --> 00:33:10,553
I--I just need to think.

591
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,041
Kim.

592
00:33:20,085 --> 00:33:22,217
Have a seat.

593
00:33:22,261 --> 00:33:24,219
Um...

594
00:33:24,263 --> 00:33:27,744
I just wanted to talk to you
about my progress.

595
00:33:27,788 --> 00:33:30,095
See, everyone got
their discipline today.

596
00:33:30,138 --> 00:33:32,706
- Yes.
Always an interesting day.

597
00:33:32,749 --> 00:33:34,708
- Except for me.

598
00:33:34,751 --> 00:33:37,015
- I heard.

599
00:33:37,058 --> 00:33:38,973
- It's not super surprising,
given the fact

600
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:42,020
that I haven't been able
to do a single piece of magic.

601
00:33:42,063 --> 00:33:44,587
- Well, so far.

602
00:33:44,631 --> 00:33:45,936
Heard that as well.

603
00:33:47,112 --> 00:33:48,722
- They're calling me a squib.

604
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,072
I even heard
Professor Lipson say it

605
00:33:51,116 --> 00:33:52,943
when she thought
I was out of the room.

606
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,816
I'll talk to her about that.

607
00:33:55,859 --> 00:33:57,600
We discourage that term.

608
00:33:57,644 --> 00:33:59,950
It's considered hate speech.

609
00:33:59,994 --> 00:34:01,865
- I mean, but don't you agree?

610
00:34:01,909 --> 00:34:03,780
- Do you?

611
00:34:03,824 --> 00:34:05,260
- Well, I...

612
00:34:05,304 --> 00:34:07,132
I mean, I think I got
the highest math scores

613
00:34:07,175 --> 00:34:09,264
in the history
of my high school,

614
00:34:09,308 --> 00:34:12,789
and I graduated Harvard
on my 19th birthday.

615
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:14,226
- Who didn't?

616
00:34:15,662 --> 00:34:18,621
- I--I'm just saying, I--

617
00:34:18,665 --> 00:34:20,928
look, of course
I want to keep trying.

618
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:25,759
It's like...
the moment that I found out

619
00:34:25,802 --> 00:34:28,718
magic was real...

620
00:34:28,762 --> 00:34:32,070
- That was the moment
that I discovered who I am.

621
00:34:33,245 --> 00:34:36,074
- You remind me
of a young woman I once knew.

622
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:39,033
Similar tenacious mind.

623
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,992
I rejected her
from Brakebills.

624
00:34:42,906 --> 00:34:44,734
- Why?

625
00:34:44,778 --> 00:34:46,171
- Suffice to say,

626
00:34:46,214 --> 00:34:48,695
I had much evidence
I was doing the right thing,

627
00:34:48,738 --> 00:34:51,263
but out on her own,

628
00:34:51,306 --> 00:34:54,222
she got hurt, badly.

629
00:34:54,266 --> 00:34:57,878
I had chosen
not to protect her.

630
00:34:57,921 --> 00:35:01,055
I'm simply not willing
to repeat that choice with you.

631
00:35:02,404 --> 00:35:04,014
So...

632
00:35:05,277 --> 00:35:06,930
Patience.

633
00:35:06,974 --> 00:35:09,237
- Magic is real.

634
00:35:09,281 --> 00:35:12,110
Magic is real!

635
00:35:12,153 --> 00:35:15,243
- This is the trippiest thing
I have ever seen.

636
00:35:15,287 --> 00:35:17,637
- I gotta say, you're
taking this pretty well.

637
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,334
- Well, you know,

638
00:35:19,378 --> 00:35:21,031
it's all an illusion.

639
00:35:21,075 --> 00:35:22,946
The Grand Maya.

640
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:25,166
- Right, yeah.

641
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:27,125
The Grand Maya.
Of course, man.

642
00:35:27,168 --> 00:35:28,778
Can I just say one thing?

643
00:35:28,822 --> 00:35:30,606
I cannot believe...
- Hey.

644
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:33,000
- You're DJ Hansel.
- Stay close, okay?

645
00:35:33,043 --> 00:35:34,610
This medal thing,
it works better

646
00:35:34,654 --> 00:35:35,916
the closer you are.
- I've been listening

647
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:37,135
to your Taylor Swift remix
nonstop.

648
00:35:37,178 --> 00:35:38,179
Is it true
that you guys hooked up?

649
00:35:38,223 --> 00:35:39,833
Um, Janet?

650
00:35:39,876 --> 00:35:41,922
- Sorry.
- You always do that.

651
00:35:41,965 --> 00:35:43,402
- I was just wondering

652
00:35:43,445 --> 00:35:45,186
what you want me to say
about all these plane tickets.

653
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:47,057
- I don't want you
to say anything.

654
00:35:47,101 --> 00:35:49,190
I want you to expense them.

655
00:35:49,234 --> 00:35:50,713
- Well, it's just that

656
00:35:50,757 --> 00:35:52,019
they don't usually
allow so many.

657
00:35:52,062 --> 00:35:54,804
- Yeah, huge feature, okay?

658
00:35:54,848 --> 00:35:57,198
That's DJ Hansel.
- Hey, how you doing?

659
00:35:57,242 --> 00:35:58,765
- Yeah, these are his minions.

660
00:35:58,808 --> 00:36:00,201
Put that, okay?

661
00:36:00,245 --> 00:36:02,072
And lattes, Sophie,
from the other place.

662
00:36:02,116 --> 00:36:03,857
You know, the one that--
the little thing I like.

663
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:05,206
- Okay, okay.
- Yeah, yeah, and--

664
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,860
and almond milk, please,
if you don't mind.

665
00:36:06,903 --> 00:36:09,079
- She's young.
I'm working with her.

666
00:36:09,123 --> 00:36:11,691
- You were working with her.

667
00:36:11,734 --> 00:36:13,301
Now, who knows?

668
00:36:13,345 --> 00:36:16,348
Who knows anything?

669
00:36:16,391 --> 00:36:19,873
- Right, 'cause magic is real.
- You know?

670
00:36:19,916 --> 00:36:21,222
- Literally.

671
00:36:21,266 --> 00:36:23,746
Like in movies,
except literally real.

672
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:26,401
- So no one can find
Kim the architect;

673
00:36:26,445 --> 00:36:29,274
Nigel, the bastard son
of a British lord,

674
00:36:29,317 --> 00:36:31,363
was reported missing
by his family;

675
00:36:31,406 --> 00:36:33,887
and, Brian
the English professor,

676
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,802
also reported missing.

677
00:36:35,845 --> 00:36:37,238
Not worrying, not worrying.
- Or another way to look at it

678
00:36:37,282 --> 00:36:39,066
is that the whole
goddamn thing is worrying

679
00:36:39,109 --> 00:36:41,199
and no one thing
is any more or less worrying

680
00:36:41,242 --> 00:36:42,461
than anything else.

681
00:36:42,504 --> 00:36:44,376
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey.

682
00:36:45,899 --> 00:36:47,857
You need breath work, man.

683
00:36:49,424 --> 00:36:51,861
So how do we figure out
who we really--

684
00:36:51,905 --> 00:36:54,342
- Don't say it.

685
00:36:54,386 --> 00:36:56,866
- Shh.
- Okay, just...

686
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,172
- I don't know how
we're supposed

687
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,478
to talk about this

688
00:36:59,521 --> 00:37:01,958
if we're not allowed
to talk about this.

689
00:37:02,002 --> 00:37:04,134
- Yeah, I mean,
shouldn't all of us

690
00:37:04,178 --> 00:37:05,788
being in a room together
be enough to--

691
00:37:05,832 --> 00:37:07,225
I don't know, I mean--
- Okay, look.

692
00:37:07,268 --> 00:37:11,054
Apparently, you have to poke
the fake ID aspect

693
00:37:11,098 --> 00:37:13,274
of the situation
pretty directly.

694
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:15,233
Okay, just talk
around it, okay?

695
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:17,496
- Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

696
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:22,240
I say we find the writer
of this comic book, right?

697
00:37:22,283 --> 00:37:24,372
James Tyberius R. Martin
is clearly a penname,

698
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:26,069
but whoever he is,
maybe he knows something

699
00:37:26,113 --> 00:37:27,723
that can help us.
- Yeah, but--

700
00:37:27,767 --> 00:37:29,116
but that written 14 years ago.

701
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:31,814
I mean, what does that
even mean?

702
00:37:31,858 --> 00:37:34,077
Because I have memories
from before,

703
00:37:34,121 --> 00:37:37,080
but they're not really mine
because I'm--

704
00:37:40,432 --> 00:37:42,347
Never mind!

705
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:44,262
Never mind, I said!

706
00:37:45,219 --> 00:37:46,873
- God.

707
00:37:46,916 --> 00:37:49,310
- You know, the guy
that got hit by a truck...

708
00:37:50,355 --> 00:37:53,140
Did he die?
- He's still in the hospital.

709
00:37:55,011 --> 00:37:57,100
- Well, if he's alive,

710
00:37:57,144 --> 00:37:59,451
then we can ask him
some questions.

711
00:37:59,494 --> 00:38:01,104
- I wish you wouldn't.

712
00:38:01,148 --> 00:38:03,803
I really feel
you've done enough for him.

713
00:38:03,846 --> 00:38:05,283
Hi.

714
00:38:05,326 --> 00:38:06,849
I'm Marina.

715
00:38:06,893 --> 00:38:10,984
You almost killed
a good friend of mine

716
00:38:11,027 --> 00:38:13,291
and stole that from him,
which he was borrowing.

717
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:15,554
So, really,
you stole it from me.

718
00:38:15,597 --> 00:38:17,338
Okay, relax.

719
00:38:17,382 --> 00:38:19,471
I'm here to help.

720
00:38:24,389 --> 00:38:25,999
- Are you even listening?

721
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:27,696
- Yeah, of course.

722
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:30,220
Of course I am.

723
00:38:30,264 --> 00:38:32,310
- We should get you cleaned up.

724
00:38:32,353 --> 00:38:34,312
You've got so much blood on you

725
00:38:34,355 --> 00:38:36,792
from that boring waiter.

726
00:38:36,836 --> 00:38:38,838
Anyway, we'll have to do it
once we get there.

727
00:38:38,881 --> 00:38:40,579
We have to hurry now.

728
00:38:40,622 --> 00:38:42,885
- Where--where are we going?

729
00:38:42,929 --> 00:38:44,887
- Scoop of pistachio
with jimmies.

730
00:38:44,931 --> 00:38:47,934
- I said I wanted sprinkles.
- Jimmies are sprinkles.

731
00:38:47,977 --> 00:38:49,718
No, stop,
jimmies are sprinkles!

732
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,463
- Jimmies aresprinkles.

733
00:38:55,507 --> 00:38:57,813
Anyway, Greece.
A temple.

734
00:38:57,857 --> 00:38:59,902
He'll be there for his transit.

735
00:38:59,946 --> 00:39:01,600
It's the only time
to catch him.

736
00:39:01,643 --> 00:39:04,603
Flay that bastard's flesh
clean off his bones.

737
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:10,260
Remind me
to get a coat.

738
00:39:10,304 --> 00:39:11,740
Am I remembering

739
00:39:11,784 --> 00:39:15,396
you kill these little bodies
if you get them too cold?

740
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,008
- Hey, is there another game
that we can play?

741
00:39:19,052 --> 00:39:22,751
One where we don't
flay anybody?

742
00:39:22,795 --> 00:39:24,013
- But he deserves it,

743
00:39:24,057 --> 00:39:26,712
sad little man
we are calling Brian.

744
00:39:26,755 --> 00:39:28,583
- Why? What did he do?
- He knows.

745
00:39:28,627 --> 00:39:31,847
Just like how all your...

746
00:39:31,891 --> 00:39:33,414
friends know too.

747
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:35,503
- Friends?
What--what friends?

748
00:39:35,547 --> 00:39:38,027
- But we can't talk
about it, Brian-Not-Brian.

749
00:39:38,071 --> 00:39:39,594
Your glamour gets very angry

750
00:39:39,638 --> 00:39:41,814
if I even say your name
too much.

751
00:39:42,945 --> 00:39:44,817
Look, it's better

752
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,862
you have no idea
what I'm talking about.

753
00:39:46,906 --> 00:39:49,343
These friends,
I'm going to kill them,

754
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,518
and we have to assume

755
00:39:50,562 --> 00:39:53,303
it's going to happen
in front of you.

756
00:39:53,347 --> 00:39:55,958
It will hurt less
if you don't know who they are.

757
00:39:58,483 --> 00:39:59,527
I like you.

758
00:40:18,633 --> 00:40:20,592
- Make yourselves at home.

759
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:27,120
- Nice digs.
- Thank you.

760
00:40:27,163 --> 00:40:29,775
I worked really hard
to steal them.

761
00:40:41,047 --> 00:40:42,614
- What is that?

762
00:40:43,528 --> 00:40:44,659
Protection.

763
00:40:44,703 --> 00:40:46,095
- From?

764
00:40:46,139 --> 00:40:48,141
- Whatever the hell's going on
with you people.

765
00:40:49,577 --> 00:40:50,578
Well, I didn't say
you could move in.

766
00:40:50,622 --> 00:40:52,145
Come on, let's go.

767
00:40:53,059 --> 00:40:55,496
All right.

768
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,498
Well, we know it's big.

769
00:40:57,542 --> 00:40:58,891
Big magic.

770
00:40:58,934 --> 00:41:00,762
Wow, okay.

771
00:41:00,806 --> 00:41:04,549
We know that you don't know
what the fuck it is.

772
00:41:04,592 --> 00:41:05,985
That's fun.

773
00:41:06,028 --> 00:41:08,030
And we know if we poke it,

774
00:41:08,074 --> 00:41:10,772
it pokes us back with a truck.

775
00:41:12,818 --> 00:41:14,384
Wow.

776
00:41:14,428 --> 00:41:16,169
Now I know how
the gold prospectors felt.

777
00:41:16,212 --> 00:41:18,432
It's just dripping off you.

778
00:41:20,652 --> 00:41:22,784
And you have no idea
what that means.

779
00:41:22,828 --> 00:41:23,872
That's fine.

780
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:26,614
You're all just very, very,

781
00:41:26,658 --> 00:41:29,748
extremely juiced up
on a level that's,

782
00:41:29,791 --> 00:41:31,750
quite frankly,
not legal these days.

783
00:41:31,793 --> 00:41:34,056
I'm just a little curious
how you all got like this.

784
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,189
- You--you and us both.

785
00:41:37,756 --> 00:41:40,759
- Okay, let's take
a peek underneath

786
00:41:40,802 --> 00:41:42,587
and see what you
really look like.

787
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:44,066
- I don't think that
whatever that is--

788
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,894
- Spell, illusion, charm,
whatever.

789
00:41:45,938 --> 00:41:47,069
- Yeah, I don't think
it's gonna let you.

790
00:41:47,113 --> 00:41:48,462
- Relax, sweetie.

791
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,594
This place is warded
up to the vag,

792
00:41:49,637 --> 00:41:50,986
and I'm very good...
- Hey.

793
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,120
- At what I do.

794
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,471
Just hold still.

795
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,734
- So you're like some powerful,

796
00:41:59,778 --> 00:42:02,868
benevolent white witch?

797
00:42:02,911 --> 00:42:04,739
- Well, that's good.

798
00:43:03,015 --> 00:43:04,843
- What in creation

799
00:43:04,886 --> 00:43:07,672
is the matter with you,
High King?

800
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,109
- Where to start with that?

801
00:43:10,152 --> 00:43:11,589
- This is out little game.

802
00:43:11,632 --> 00:43:13,547
I have to ask you
to do things twice

803
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:16,768
because you're such
a handsome king.

804
00:43:16,811 --> 00:43:18,857
Enough flirtation.

805
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,990
It's unseemly that a simulacrum
of this magnificence

806
00:43:22,034 --> 00:43:24,819
should be bothered
so repeatedly.

807
00:43:24,863 --> 00:43:26,168
Fix it.

808
00:43:26,212 --> 00:43:28,649
- Fix what?

809
00:43:28,693 --> 00:43:31,217
I don't know
what you want me to fix!

810
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:34,524
- Whatever the matter is
in Fillory, you simple boy!

811
00:43:34,568 --> 00:43:35,830
Find the bother.

812
00:43:35,874 --> 00:43:37,963
Find it, fix it.

813
00:43:38,006 --> 00:43:39,573
- A, fuck you.

814
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,836
B, I'm not in Fillory.

815
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,924
- What?

816
00:43:42,968 --> 00:43:44,273
- I'm in New York City,

817
00:43:44,317 --> 00:43:46,711
along with everyone else
that matters.

818
00:43:46,754 --> 00:43:48,234
Fillory is fiction.

819
00:43:48,277 --> 00:43:50,932
It's a kid's book.
- Why didn't you say so?

820
00:43:50,976 --> 00:43:52,760
Time to wake up, High King.

821
00:43:52,804 --> 00:43:55,110
Many blessings.

822
00:44:02,988 --> 00:44:04,729
Guys?

823
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,647
Sam?

824
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,303
Hansel?

825
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:19,265
What the high holy Jesus freak?

826
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,922
Wake up. Wake up.

827
00:44:23,965 --> 00:44:25,227
Wake up.

828
00:44:25,271 --> 00:44:26,707
Wake the fuck up!

829
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:29,057
Wake up!

830
00:44:31,364 --> 00:44:34,672
Fuck!

831
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,110
Hello?

832
00:44:39,067 --> 00:44:40,808
Hello?
