see you next week

cast in your room?

I mean, the entire cell is
coated with deadening paint.

530
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:24,486
I mean, you'd have to
scrape off an entire wall

531
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:27,002
to get anywhere. How?

532
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:30,439
NICK: Uh, I did it the
old-fashioned way.

533
00:27:30,516 --> 00:27:34,476
I pulled the edge
off of my food tray.

534
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:37,479
Uh, well, the point is...

535
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,520
Is that I'm glad I'm not dead.

536
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:44,153

thought your brother
got you and vice versa...

00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,645
Wait, are you saying
that that was you?

546
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:11,121
Alice, you are good.

547
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,250
You're nice.

kids as smart as you

549
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,593
were naughty as shit.

00:28:19,665 --> 00:28:21,827
you hurt people

552
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:25,029
and you think that
means you should hurt.

553
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:28,972
But I know.

554
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:32,375
I know you are not a bad person.

555
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:36,108

have seen this coming.

You're here because
you knowingly

577
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:34,795
broke a contract with The Order.

578
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:36,858
Not for causing what
happened to your friends.

579
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:38,836
You didn't cause that.

580
00:30:38,904 --> 00:30:40,805

something about guilt.

00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:55,845
You wonder why I care.

584
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:58,423
After all, you
betrayed The Order.

585
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,490
You probably think

586
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:00,958
I've singled you
out for punishment.

587
00:31:03,462 --> 00:31:05,693
I did single you out.

588
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:07,732
For rehabilitation.

makings of a Master.

may be invited to participate,

This isn't a prison,

596
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:32,696
because what could
be more fulfilling

597
00:31:32,758 --> 00:31:35,353
than immersion in the
great work of The Order?

598
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,931

did to those keys,

600

magic itself, so...

It's not super
surprising, given the fact

do a single piece of magic.

00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,240
I don't know how we're
supposed to talk about this

722
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,512
if we're not allowed
to talk about this.

723

HANSEL: Yeah, I
mean, shouldn't all of us

724
00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:04,517
being in a room
together be enough to...

725
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:05,955
I don't know, I
mean... Okay, look.

726
00:37:06,024 --> 00:37:09,791
Apparently, you have to
poke the fake ID aspect

727
00:37:09,861 --> 00:37:12,023
of the situation
pretty directly.

728
00:37:12,097 --> 00:37:13,963
Okay, just talk around it, okay?

729
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:16,194
Okay, okay, okay. Okay,
okay, okay, okay, okay.

730
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:20,830
I say we find the writer
of this comic book, right?

731
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,136
James Tiberius R. Martin
is clearly a pen name,

732
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:25,586
but whoever he is, maybe he
knows something that can help us.

733
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,841
Yeah, but... But that
was written 14 years ago.

734
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,347
I mean, what does
that even mean?

735
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,816
Because I have
memories from before,

736

that got hit by a truck...

742
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,592
Did he die? He's
still in the hospital.

743
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:55,707
Well, if he's alive,

744
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:57,538
then we can ask
him some questions.

I wish you wouldn't.

done enough for him.

I'm Marina.

749
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:08,978
You almost killed a
good friend of mine

750
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,916
and stole that from him,
which he was borrowing.

751
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:14,482
So, really, you
stole it from me.

752
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:15,959
Okay, relax.

753
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,263
I'm here to help.

Yeah, of course. Of course I am.

757
00:38:29,374 --> 00:38:31,400
We should get you cleaned up.

758
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:35,436
You've got so much blood
on you from that boring waiter.

759
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,074
Anyway, we'll have to
do it once we get there.

760
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,674
We have to hurry now.

761
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,287

00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:44,151
Scoop of pistachio with jimmies.

763
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:47,021
I said I wanted sprinkles.
Jimmies are sprinkles.

764
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,003
No, stop that,
jimmies are sprinkles!

00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:14,477
you kill these little bodies
if you get them too cold?

774
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:18,387
Hey, is there another
game that we can play?

Oh, but he deserves it,

are calling Brian.

778
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:27,693
Why? What did he do? He knows.

779
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:30,162
Just like how all your

780
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,560
friends know, too.

it, Brian-Not-Brian.

going to kill them,

and we have to assume it's
going to happen in front of you.

don't know who they are.

you could move in.

it pokes us back with a truck.

it's gonna let you.
