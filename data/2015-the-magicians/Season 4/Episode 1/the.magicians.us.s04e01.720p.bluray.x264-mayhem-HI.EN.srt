see you next week

doesn't resolve.

cast in your room?

- I can't do any magic.
- NICK: Of course you can't.

529

I mean, the entire cell
is coated with deadening paint.

530
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,494
I mean, you'd have
to scrape off an entire wall

531
00:27:24,518 --> 00:27:27,010
- to get anywhere.
- How?

532
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:30,434
NICK: Uh, I did it
the old-fashioned way.

533
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:34,484
I pulled the edge off
of my food tray.

534
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:37,483
Uh, well, the point is...

535
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,523
Is that I'm glad
I'm not dead.

- (RINGING STOPS)

716
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:46,618
You need breath work, man.

717
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,476
- So, how do we figure out who we really...
- (HIGH-PITCHED RINGING)

718
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,083
Oh, don't say it.

719
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,410
- Shh.
- (TRILLING STOPS)

720
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:55,585
Okay, just...

721
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:58,210
I don't know how we're supposed
to talk about this

722
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:00,507
if we're not allowed
to talk about this.

723
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,710
HANSEL: Yeah, I mean,
shouldn't all of us

724
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:04,511
being in a room
together be enough to...

725
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:05,991
- I don't know, I mean...
- Okay, look.

726
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:09,759
Apparently, you have
to poke the fake ID aspect

727
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:12,015
of the situation
pretty directly.

728
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:13,937
Okay, just talk
around it, okay?

729
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,185
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

730
00:37:16,276 --> 00:37:20,816
I say we find the writer
of this comic book, right?

731
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,113
James Tiberius R. Martin
is clearly a pen name,

732
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,594
but whoever he is, maybe he knows
something that can help us.

733
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:27,826
Yeah, but...
But that was written 14 years ago.

734
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,325
I mean, what does
that even mean?

735
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,748
Because I have memories
from before,

736
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:35,619
- but they're not really mine because I'm...

737
00:37:35,712 --> 00:37:37,578
(ALL SCREAMING)

738
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,002
Never mind!

739
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:42,799
Never mind, I said!

740
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,586
Oh, God.

741
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,922
You know, the guy
that got hit by a truck...

742
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,592
- Did he die?
- He's still in the hospital.

743
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:55,684
Well, if he's alive,

744
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:57,515
then we can ask
him some questions.

745
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,687
MARINA: (SIGHS)
I wish you wouldn't.

746
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:02,319
I really feel you've
done enough for him.

747
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,441
Hi.

748
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,356
I'm Marina.

749
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:08,989
You almost killed
a good friend of mine

750
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,905
and stole that from him,
which he was borrowing.

751
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,456
So, really,
you stole it from me.

752
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,953
Okay, relax.

753
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:18,252
I'm here to help.
