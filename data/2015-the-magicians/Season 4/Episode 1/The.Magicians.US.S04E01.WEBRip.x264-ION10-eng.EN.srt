00:19:17,852 --> 00:19:18,940
Work on?

374
00:19:18,983 --> 00:19:21,421
- Well, this glorious emanation

375
00:19:21,464 --> 00:19:23,858
can only be triggered
by world war,

376
00:19:23,901 --> 00:19:26,426
pandemic, arrival of hostile

377
00:19:26,469 --> 00:19:29,298
or uninvited gods
onto Fillorian soil,

378
00:19:29,342 --> 00:19:32,258
revolt of dwarves,
or mass rising of the dead.

379
00:19:32,301 --> 00:19:35,043
Not sure they'd be able
to do much, the dead.

380
00:19:35,086 --> 00:19:37,088
They're sort of feeble
and rotting.

381
00:19:37,132 --> 00:19:38,829
It just struck me as creepy,

382
00:19:38,873 --> 00:19:40,962
and I'd rather you put
a stop to it.

383
00:19:41,005 --> 00:19:43,660
- Okay, horn person?

384
00:19:43,704 --> 00:19:45,488
My name is Janet.

385
00:19:45,532 --> 00:19:46,794

Ate white cheddar popcorn

483
00:24:17,412 --> 00:24:20,894
You have a dedicated closet
for wigs and fetish underwear?

498
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,979
I'm not good at comforting...

499
00:25:04,154 --> 00:25:07,331
But for what it's worth,
it's gonna be okay.

500
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:09,682
No, don't lie.
- I'm not.

501
00:25:09,725 --> 00:25:11,205
I've been where you are.

502
00:25:11,248 --> 00:25:14,774
Did I ever tell you
why they locked me up?

503
00:25:14,817 --> 00:25:16,297
- Talking too much?

504
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:19,953
I was obsessed
with perfecting this spell.

505
00:25:19,996 --> 00:25:22,042
You ever hear of Diogenes?

506
00:25:22,085 --> 00:25:25,393
Yeah, sad-sack philosopher
with a lantern,

507
00:25:25,436 --> 00:25:28,309
in search of one honest man.

508
00:25:28,352 --> 00:25:30,703
- I was finishing his work

509
00:25:30,746 --> 00:25:33,227
to find good people.

510
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,445
- Why?

511
00:25:34,489 --> 00:25:36,273
- Feel less alone.

512
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,102
Biggest obstacle being that

513
00:25:39,146 --> 00:25:41,191
almost no good people exist.

514
00:25:42,192 --> 00:25:43,890
Anyway, I kept refining it,

515
00:25:43,933 --> 00:25:46,936
and I realized that
I had to focus on children,

516
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,330
because sometimes,

517
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:51,680
they're not rotten
to the core yet.

518
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:55,075
Anyway, that's all I wanted,

519
00:25:55,118 --> 00:25:56,990
was to find some good kids,

520
00:25:57,033 --> 00:25:59,819
and in some small way,
reward them.

521
00:25:59,862 --> 00:26:02,952
Come to a point
where I needed this book.

522
00:26:02,996 --> 00:26:03,866
Restricted.

523
00:26:05,738 --> 00:26:07,391
They kept it in a place
they call, uh...

524
00:26:07,435 --> 00:26:10,177
- The poison room.

525
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:13,049
Yeah, killed one of my friends.

526
00:26:13,093 --> 00:26:14,834
- Yeah.

527
00:26:14,877 --> 00:26:17,793
It killed some of mine, too.

528
00:26:17,837 --> 00:26:21,362
I was working with
these elf gentlemen.

529
00:26:21,405 --> 00:26:24,017
Uh, it was bad.

530
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,759
Elves...elves are real?
- Sweet guys.

531
00:26:26,802 --> 00:26:28,848
All that weird sex stuff
you hear about

532
00:26:28,891 --> 00:26:30,501
is only partially true.

533
00:26:30,545 --> 00:26:34,331
Anyway, the Library
came after me.

534
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:38,031
Possession, uh,
murder on Library property,

535
00:26:38,074 --> 00:26:40,381
like...like I personally
murdered anyone.

536
00:26:40,424 --> 00:26:42,122
Please.

537
00:26:42,165 --> 00:26:44,167
- Wait.

538
00:26:44,211 --> 00:26:45,865
A spells that rewards
good children,

539
00:26:45,908 --> 00:26:46,953
and you and your elves...

540
00:26:46,996 --> 00:26:48,868
- That was a long time ago.

541
00:26:49,782 --> 00:26:52,001
Are you Santa Claus?

542
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:54,917
Well...

543
00:26:54,961 --> 00:26:58,051
Well, I'm not, not that.

544
00:26:58,094 --> 00:26:59,182
But I don't like that name.

545
00:26:59,226 --> 00:27:00,227
It got very commercial,

546
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,185
very shopping-mall.

547
00:27:03,186 --> 00:27:05,145
Look, just call me Nick,
asshole.

548
00:27:07,016 --> 00:27:10,237
- I tried to escape early on.

549
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,891
Ended up lost in the stacks.

550
00:27:11,934 --> 00:27:14,197
They found me, of course,

551
00:27:14,241 --> 00:27:16,417
and that's when I tried
to kill myself.

552
00:27:17,461 --> 00:27:19,725
- Really?

553
00:27:19,768 --> 00:27:21,814
How...how did you cast
in your room?

to get anywhere.
- How?

558
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:33,477
Uh, I did it
the old-fashioned way.

559
00:27:33,521 --> 00:27:37,525
I pulled the edge
off of my food tray.

the English professor,

736
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,802
also reported missing.

737
00:36:35,845 --> 00:36:37,238
Not worrying, not worrying.
- Or another way to look at it

738
00:36:37,282 --> 00:36:39,066
is that the whole
goddamn thing is worrying

739
00:36:39,109 --> 00:36:41,199
and no one thing
is any more or less worrying

740
00:36:41,242 --> 00:36:42,461
than anything else.

741
00:36:42,504 --> 00:36:44,376
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, hey.

742
00:36:45,899 --> 00:36:47,857
You need breath work, man.

743
00:36:49,424 --> 00:36:51,861
So how do we figure out
who we really...

744
00:36:51,905 --> 00:36:54,342
- Don't say it.

745
00:36:54,386 --> 00:36:56,866
Shh.
- Okay, just...

746
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:58,172
I don't know how
we're supposed

747
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,478
to talk about this

748
00:36:59,521 --> 00:37:01,958
if we're not allowed
to talk about this.

749
00:37:02,002 --> 00:37:04,134
Yeah, I mean,
shouldn't all of us

750
00:37:04,178 --> 00:37:05,788
being in a room together
be enough to...

751
00:37:05,832 --> 00:37:07,225
I don't know, I mean...
- Okay, look.

752
00:37:07,268 --> 00:37:11,054
Apparently, you have to poke
the fake ID aspect

753
00:37:11,098 --> 00:37:13,274
of the situation
pretty directly.

754
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:15,233
Okay, just talk
around it, okay?

755
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:17,496
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

756
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:22,240
I say we find the writer
of this comic book, right?

757
00:37:22,283 --> 00:37:24,372
James Tyberius R. Martin
is clearly a penname,

758
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:26,069
but whoever he is,
maybe he knows something

759
00:37:26,113 --> 00:37:27,723
that can help us.
- Yeah, but...

760
00:37:27,767 --> 00:37:29,116
but that written 14 years ago.

761
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:31,814
I mean, what does that
even mean?

762
00:37:31,858 --> 00:37:34,077
Because I have memories
from before,

763
00:37:34,121 --> 00:37:37,080
but they're not really mine
because I'm...

764
00:37:40,432 --> 00:37:42,347
Uh, never mind!

765
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:44,262
Never mind, I said!

766
00:37:45,219 --> 00:37:46,873
- Oh, God.

767
00:37:46,916 --> 00:37:49,310
You know, the guy
that got hit by a truck...

768
00:37:50,355 --> 00:37:53,140
Did he die?
- He's still in the hospital.

769
00:37:55,011 --> 00:37:57,100
- Well, if he's alive,

770
00:37:57,144 --> 00:37:59,451
then we can ask him
some questions.

771
00:37:59,494 --> 00:38:01,104
- Oh, I wish you wouldn't.

772
00:38:01,148 --> 00:38:03,803
I really feel
you've done enough for him.

773
00:38:03,846 --> 00:38:05,283
Hi.

774
00:38:05,326 --> 00:38:06,849
I'm Marina.

775
00:38:06,893 --> 00:38:10,984
You almost killed
a good friend of mine

776
00:38:11,027 --> 00:38:13,291
and stole that from him,
which he was borrowing.

777
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:15,554
So, really,
you stole it from me.

778
00:38:15,597 --> 00:38:17,338
Okay, relax.

779
00:38:17,382 --> 00:38:19,471
I'm here to help.

780
00:38:24,389 --> 00:38:25,999
- Are you even listening?

781
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:27,696
- Yeah, of course.

782
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:30,220
Of course I am.

783
00:38:30,264 --> 00:38:32,310
- We should get you cleaned up.

784
00:38:32,353 --> 00:38:34,312
You've got so much blood on you

785
00:38:34,355 --> 00:38:36,792
from that boring waiter.

786
00:38:36,836 --> 00:38:38,838
Anyway, we'll have to do it
once we get there.

787
00:38:38,881 --> 00:38:40,579
We have to hurry now.

788
00:38:40,622 --> 00:38:42,885
- Where...where are we going?

789
00:38:42,929 --> 00:38:44,887
Scoop of pistachio
with jimmies.

790
00:38:44,931 --> 00:38:47,934
I said I wanted sprinkles.
- Jimmies are sprinkles.

791
00:38:47,977 --> 00:38:49,718
No, stop,
jimmies are sprinkles!

792
00:38:49,762 --> 00:38:50,806
- Ah!

793
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,463
- Hmm, jimmies aresprinkles.

794
00:38:55,507 --> 00:38:57,813
Anyway, Greece.
A temple.

795
00:38:57,857 --> 00:38:59,902
He'll be there for his transit.

796
00:38:59,946 --> 00:39:01,600
It's the only time
to catch him.

797
00:39:01,643 --> 00:39:04,603
Flay that bastard's flesh
clean off his bones.

798
00:39:06,387 --> 00:39:10,260
Oh, remind me
to get a coat.

800
00:39:11,784 --> 00:39:15,396
you kill these little bodies
if you get them too cold?

801
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,008
Hey, is there another game
that we can play?

802
00:39:19,052 --> 00:39:22,751
One where we don't
flay anybody?

803
00:39:22,795 --> 00:39:24,013
- Oh, but he deserves it,

804

we are calling Brian.

- He knows.

807
