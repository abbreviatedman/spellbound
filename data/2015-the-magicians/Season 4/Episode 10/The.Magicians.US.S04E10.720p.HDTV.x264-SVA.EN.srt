1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:03,045
My mother was a hedge witch, too.

2
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:04,546
I didn’t know you were a hedge.

3
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,758
Oh, yes. My mentor, Everett, found me.

4
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:23,357
The Foremost, save them with
special weapons that expel possession.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,318
They call them ice axes,
and I’m assuming that’s poetic license.

6
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,195
So we might have
a chance to save Eliot.

7
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:31,323
Overthrow me
right the fuck now, Fen.

8
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,575
I never should have…
- Or I will never forgive you.

9
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:34,910
And neither will Eliot

10
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:37,746
if you keep me from getting
the one thing that can save him.

11
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:45,045
When the going gets tough, the tough
listens to pop band from the Eighties.

12
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:48,215
Hi. It’s me, it’s the real me.
It’s Eliot.

13
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,456
This is a Mind Palace situation,

14
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:52,803
and I have some extremely
major shit to tell you.

15
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,013
Some God of war.

16
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:58,100
He only liked them
when they were too weak to fight.

17
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,060
He’s not trying to rebuild his body.

18
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:03,146
That’s not what the stones are.
That’s not what they’re for.

19
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:04,982
It’s so much worse than that.

20
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:08,694
Just breathe.

21
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,780
If the stones aren't for building a body,
what does he want with them?

22
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:14,032
No, he's building a body.

23
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:17,369
His sister's.
He’s trying to bring her back to life.

24
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,621
Oh, my God.

25
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:22,245
That's the girl he
thought was a sacrifice

26
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,001
to summon Enyalius. But she wasn’t.

27
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,794
Enyalius and the other gods
killed her.

28
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:28,255
They chopped her up,
and turned her into four stone organs.

29
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,508
- Jesus. There's two of them? 
- Yeah.

30
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:35,095
If he got prison and she got the death
penalty, I'm guessing she's the bad one.

31
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:38,807
'Til he remembers,
he won’t know to go look for Enyalius.

32
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:44,146
Hi.

33
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,733
If you wanna talk to me,
price is a drink.

34
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,526
You're fun.

35
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,072
One drink.

36
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,284
- What are you having, ma’am?
- Vodka ice.

37
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:58,869
Vodka ice.

38
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,498
There you go.

39
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,629
- I have a question.
- No, I don't come here often.

40
00:02:08,712 --> 00:02:12,925
You haven’t seen me anywhere.
And yes, I do have plans this weekend.

41
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:15,969
- Still have a question?
- Yes.

42
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:21,141
Why does this place smell like death?

43
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,232
It is weird, right?

44
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,276
A bar next to a hospital.

45
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,530
Doctors need happy hour, too, I guess.

46
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:38,742
So that’s what you are? A doctor?

47
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,119
No.

48
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:44,373
I'm sick.

49
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,750
But I got good news today.

50
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:49,419
I'll only be sick
for another two months.

51
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:51,255
Three, maybe.

52
00:02:54,091 --> 00:02:57,177
Sometimes, my friend says one thing,

53
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:59,096
but means another thing.

54
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:01,849
Is that what you're doing?

55
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:06,645
- Keep 'em coming.
- Keep them coming.

56
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,842
Well I’m definitely hitting
my steps goal today, huh?

57
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:52,191
Jesus fuck a wise man's donkey!

58
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,289
Just give me a sign.

59
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,625
Come on. Where’s water?

60
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,251
Anything.

61
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,167
Wait.

62
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,720
El?

63
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:12,813
Eliot?

64
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,692
Oh, my God!

65
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,581
Hey! It’s you, right?

66
00:05:32,207 --> 00:05:35,377
Cant’ be the Monster.
He doesn’t have the moves.

67
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,921
Hey, what are you doing here?

68
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,632
Turn down the music and talk to
me, will you?

69
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:45,262
Wait a sec. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

70
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,806
Oh, my God, I’m tripping on lizard.

71
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,865
Oh, come on.

72
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:48,742
Don’t get me wrong, I’m happy to see you.

73
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:52,496
Where are you taking me, Eliot?
I’m so thirsty.

74
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,623
Woman. Hello.

75
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:40,919
Oh, Hey.

76
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:42,880
Hi.

77
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:48,468
Can't believe that psychotropic
douche got me here.

78
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:51,471
Can I get some water?

79
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:56,059
Who wants the honor of killing her?

80
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,145
Hey, if water's a deal-ee-oh, I'm good.

81
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:00,147
Oh, we have water.

82
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,107
What we don't have are strangers
wandering in to our camp.

83
00:08:02,191 --> 00:08:03,775
Her wrist.

84
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:12,201
Our enemy's enemy is our ally.

85
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:14,119
Well how ‘bout that.

86
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:29,218
You're in pain, aren't you?

87
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:33,138
Come with me.

88
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:35,766
I can take it away.

89
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,519
Sorry but I gotta get home
and tell my parents

90
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:40,854
all the medical debt
was for nothing.

91
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,069
Thanks for the drinks.

92
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:49,613
Wait.

93
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:51,865
Do that again.

94
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:54,243
My face.

95
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,204
Touch my face.

96
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,041
Are you okay?

97
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:07,256
Whenever you touch my
face, I remember something.

98
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:11,510
Again.

99
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,851
You remind me of
someone I had forgotten.

100
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,562
My sister.

101
00:09:21,645 --> 00:09:25,232
- I'm gonna leave.
- No, you have to come with me now.

102
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,734
No, I'm…

103
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:37,661
What's up?

104
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,997
This was in the Mirror World.

105
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,499
And I heard you were looking
for the Binder so…

106
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,128
Holy shit.

107
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:48,463
It's in some language
I've never seen before. I…

108
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:52,885
I’ll um…I'll get on this just
as soon as we find Enyalius.

109
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:54,511
Hopefully before the Monster does.

110
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,431
I…I thought we wanted him
to find Enyalius.

111
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,933
Yeah, we did, but we were wrong.

112
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:01,143
He's building his sister.

113
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,229
What're y'all doing?

114
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:08,317
Tracking the Library's
entire magic infrastructure

115
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,360
to find weak points
and start a rebellion.

116
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:14,907
But, um, good luck with yours.

117
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,909
Yeah, thanks. You, too.

118
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:19,203
I can tell you what he looks like,

119
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:23,248
the food the dude likes to eat,
but shit-all for anything useful.

120
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,167
One thing is bugging me.

121
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,754
In the memory I could swear
he was wearing a ring, emerald.

122
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:32,883
Guy is described up and down,
but nothing about the ring.

123
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,052
- Wait a minute, did you say emerald?
- Yeah.

124
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:39,431
When I did research with
the Free Traders, there was this god.

125
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:41,308
What was his name?

126
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:44,937
He always worked in disguise, but…

127
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,856
he was known for
always wearing an emerald ring.

128
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,442
So "Enyalius" is a front?

129
00:10:51,026 --> 00:10:52,986
Here. Aengus.

130
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,572
Celtic god.

131
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,660
Jules, it says here, he's a Trickster.

132
00:10:59,743 --> 00:11:01,036
It's fine.

133
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:04,039
And, we…it wouldn’t be a summoning,

134
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:06,583
we can only get to him
through a magical creature.

135
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:11,463
Apparently there's a whole species that
exists to entertain him and protect him,

136
00:11:11,547 --> 00:11:14,508
and they're really annoying, and...

137
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,218
what I'm getting at is…

138
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,220
we need to find a leprechaun.

139
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,867
- Don't.
- I’m sorry.

140
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:44,204
Listen… I just saw this red sand
out there, it was following me.

141
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:46,415
I thought it was because
I was “tripping balls.”

142
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:51,712
Our desert is alive. It’s filled with
demon spirits that attack our women.

143
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:55,257
Okay.

144
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,967
Speaking of “D” spirits,

145
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,554
I'm looking for something….
…I think you guys have.

146
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:01,680
A pair of black…

147
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:03,640
You're angry with me? How dare you?

148
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:07,311
You lay with my sister and I'm the one
you scream at? I'm the one you threaten?

149
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,313
Zal. Calm yourself.

150
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:10,439
Pig!

151
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:12,858
You want my sister? She's yours!

152
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:14,610
Wow, “Desert Dynasty.”

153
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:16,403
Do you think we’re going
to get a girl fight?

154
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,739
Jesus, how long does one lick last?

155
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:21,116
Take her! You two deserve each other!

156
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,036
You must be silent! Now!

157
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:38,884
Gross.

158
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:42,012
But cool. But gross.

159
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:06,662
So, anytime a woman gets
a teensy bit emotional…

160
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:09,373
one of those things rises
up out of the sand and what?

161
00:13:09,957 --> 00:13:11,750
Possesses her.

162
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:13,836
Eventually causing
paralysis even death.

163
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,339
The men save us because they alone
have the strength to survive.

164
00:13:17,422 --> 00:13:19,716
And the spirit zoo you got going?

165
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,886
They can't be killed
so I learned how to imprison them.

166
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:25,806
Some brave dudes.

167
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,100
And some awfully compliant women.

168
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:37,109
You're not seeing
or hearing this are you?

169
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:39,987
Seeing or hearing...

170
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,447
I thought so.

171
00:13:42,531 --> 00:13:45,617
Man, this lizard's got a
half-life like uranium.

172
00:13:45,701 --> 00:13:49,204
So, the guy with the axes.
Which tent's he hang his thong in?

173
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,584
Have we identified the leader
of the Serpent group yet?

174
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:55,460
Not yet. But we're looking.

175
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:57,880
Where?

176
00:13:57,963 --> 00:14:00,257
Phyllis is in charge
of that investigation.

177
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,177
I could join her.

178
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,263
Perhaps there are places
she doesn't know to look that I would.

179
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:07,764
Considering my past.

180
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:10,225
That's a very generous offer,

181
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,730
but it seems that you have
enough on your plate already.

182
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:17,524
Very well.

183
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:20,527
I was just sitting in a bar
when a bear named Humbledrum

184
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:21,778
started talking to me.

185
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:25,073
What can I tell you,
Fillory's a weird place.

186
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:28,160
- So I hear. But you…
- Uh-huh.

187
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:30,412
- A woman.
- Uh-huh.

188
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,581
- As king.
- Talking animals!

189
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:48,764
I’m going to go get some more.

190
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:01,735
Wow. Light speed, Bambi.

191
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:04,821
Okay, can you just tell me?

192
00:15:04,905 --> 00:15:06,156
What the hell are you?

193
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,616
Pieces of you.

194
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,078
Your spirit guide, your memories,

195
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:14,331
your Eliot, your conscience.

196
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:16,625
Speaking of conscience.

197
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:18,085
Wait, what?

198
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:21,880
You really gonna pass lycanthropy to a
guy who lives on a planet with two moons?

199
00:15:21,964 --> 00:15:24,550
I'll tell him I'm surfing the red
breakers and we gotta get creative.

200
00:15:24,633 --> 00:15:27,469
And this is just to get the axes.

201
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:30,055
Out. Now.

202
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:35,477
And this is guiding me, how?

203
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,355
It's the song you think to yourself

204
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,275
whenever you're working a guy.
Remember?

205
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,527
High school, junior year?

206
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:46,989
- Ray Latanza.
- Ray Latanza.

207
00:15:47,072 --> 00:15:50,075
- Yeah.
- This song came on on the car radio...

208
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,911
I wanted to ride in his Porsche
so I gave him a handjob.

209
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:56,582
In your own driveway, which is sad,
because then your dad walked out.

210
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:58,625
Okay, “road closure on Memory Lane.”

211
00:16:30,407 --> 00:16:31,950
Hi, Margo! Thanks for inviting me!

212
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:33,452
I invited her?

213
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:31,426
The Library says that they have
sufficient levels of ambient magic.

214
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:35,138
Magic output reports
are published weekly.

215
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,933
Yeah, well, we didn't trust them.
And guess what?

216
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:41,228
Look, this is how much magic

217
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:43,689
the Library says is being
distributed as ambient.

218
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:47,734
And this is the level
in the pipes right now.

219
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:52,239
It’s nothing close to amount
of magic they say there is.

220
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:57,244
So long as Library members
get their Deweys, who cares?

221
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:58,495
Besides hedges.

222
00:18:00,122 --> 00:18:01,915
- That can't be right.
- It is.

223
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,128
We bugged the pipes.

224
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:07,921
A beetle with McCormick's Tracer.

225
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:10,507
Were you mapping the pipe system?

226
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:12,217
Trying to.

227
00:18:12,885 --> 00:18:16,096
Until our beetle disintegrated
somewhere outside Earth.

228
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,265
But the spell shows magic levels.

229
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:20,475
And when we saw this,
we thought we should show you,

230
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,062
because I don’t think you signed up
to work for an organization that lies.

231
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:26,398
- Right?
- I'm sure there's an explanation.

232
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:28,442
There is.

233
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:30,986
Harriet told you. And me.

234
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:33,405
Everett's trying to
squeeze out hedges.

235
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:35,324
This is just more of same.

236
00:18:35,407 --> 00:18:37,576
Look, you're on the inside.

237
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:41,413
You can find out where
the extra magic is going

238
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:44,917
and why they’re hoarding it,
and why the Library is lying.

239
00:18:48,003 --> 00:18:49,338
Yeah, Sweetie, just

240
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:51,882
let me borrow them.
I'll have 'em back in a day,

241
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:53,592
two at the most.

242
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:57,262
No one else can use them but me.

243
00:18:58,055 --> 00:18:59,765
They're enchanted.

244
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:03,185
As I'm sure you can
understand, better than most.

245
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:06,563
I, uh,

246
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:08,899
I loved it last night,
when you did that thing to me.

247
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,821
What are you, some kind of a witch?

248
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:16,323
Magician.

249
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:20,702
- So can I get ones that work for me?
- You'll have to make your own.

250
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:22,329
Swell. How?

251
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:34,883
Mostly white, no?

252
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:36,718
But every hundredth grain or so...

253
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:40,681
is black.

254
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,476
A warrior goes alone
into the desert.

255
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:47,104
Picks out only the black ones,

256
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:49,857
enough to fill a large bag.

257
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:52,192
Which is then forged.

258
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:56,029
- Thanks.
- You're gonna try?

259
00:19:56,113 --> 00:19:57,906
I'm gonna do.

260
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,493
If you get the least bit emotional
the spirits will possess you.

261
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:03,328
Clear on that.

262
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:06,665
- And there'll be no man to protect you.
- Story of my life.

263
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:09,877
And you can't use magic.
It renders the grains...

264
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,086
Impotent?

265
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:15,174
- I don't know that word.
- You sure don't, Marathon Man.

266
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:36,695
What is she doing here?

267
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:39,114
- Four octave range, bitch.
- Seriously?

268
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:43,535
I got my id, my lost innocence,
my guilt, and now my inadequacy?

269
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:22,282
Okay this is too much.

270
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:24,576
Your subconscious thought
you needed some wisdom.

271
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:27,913
You do whiskey, not wisdom.

272
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:30,082
Okay, fine.

273
00:21:38,924 --> 00:21:40,384
Show off.

274
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:07,911
Mornin'. What can I do ya for?

275
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:10,873
Uh, we’re hoping that you
could help us find somebody.

276
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:14,209
Well, I’m not sure about that,
but, uh, I could fix your shoes.

277
00:22:15,878 --> 00:22:17,588
Uh, this is Berry's, right?

278
00:22:17,671 --> 00:22:20,924
Yeah, I'm Berry. So…

279
00:22:21,008 --> 00:22:23,093
We're looking for a leprechaun.

280
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:31,101
Right. So, are you looking for
like a "pot o' gold" leprechaun,

281
00:22:31,185 --> 00:22:33,687
or is this a breakfast
cereal situation, or...

282
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,105
We're looking for
a god named Aengus,

283
00:22:35,189 --> 00:22:37,191
but to find him,
we have to talk to a leprechaun first,

284
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:40,485
and I know this is a batshit
thing to say with a straight face,

285
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:42,738
but, if you could help us.

286
00:22:43,989 --> 00:22:47,159
Oh, all right, since you're desperate.

287
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:48,827
Are you the leprechaun?

288
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:52,080
What do you expect some short
little bearded shite in overalls?

289
00:22:52,164 --> 00:22:53,790
With a buckle on me hat?

290
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:54,791
Why didn't you just tell us?

291
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,668
Иecause you’re hysterical
when you’re desperate.

292
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:08,805
Wanna see Aengus?
He’s right through there.

293
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:16,188
Great, no knob.

294
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:19,107
Someone’s trying to kill your
boss and we need to warn him

295
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:20,734
so please just let us through.

296
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,653
No.

297
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:25,489
Aengus is pretty strict on that.
Keeps out the riff-raff.

298
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:29,868
Don't worry, everything you need
to open the door is in here.

299
00:23:29,952 --> 00:23:31,078
It's fun.

300
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:34,498
It’s an escape room.
Like, for kids’ parties?

301
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:37,918
Uh, not ours.

302
00:25:01,627 --> 00:25:03,378
Enough.

303
00:25:04,463 --> 00:25:07,341
You loved this song when you were
little and your father sang it.

304
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:09,426
You're me, right?

305
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,595
I run me. So shut it.

306
00:25:57,391 --> 00:25:59,059
Yes.

307
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:04,106
It’s okay, I think I can get it.

308
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:06,149
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. Wait.

309
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:09,528
Lets the knob down, but if you stick your
arm up there, you’ll just get sliced up.

310
00:26:10,863 --> 00:26:13,824
We have no idea how close the Monster is.
So if I get cut, I get cut.

311
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:16,159
- We don’t have time to argue about this.
- Stupid, because

312
00:26:16,243 --> 00:26:17,911
one of us here is indestructible.

313
00:26:38,891 --> 00:26:41,727
It's you. Julia.

314
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,605
Aengus has been very
interested in you.

315
00:26:44,688 --> 00:26:45,981
What’s that supposed to mean?

316
00:26:46,064 --> 00:26:47,983
No, no, nothing to worry.

317
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:52,696
We've all been interested in the
girl who became a goddess who became…

318
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:55,199
Shit, we still need a key.

319
00:26:56,033 --> 00:26:58,327
Well then, maybe Aengus would
appreciate it if you let us through?

320
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,579
Oh, I can't!

321
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:09,296
I quit. I can’t do this anymore.

322
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:11,548
That goddamn lullaby.

323
00:27:13,717 --> 00:27:15,969
He'd sing it every night to me,

324
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:19,056
even away on business,

325
00:27:19,932 --> 00:27:22,351
he'd sing it over the phone.

326
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:25,646
He called me his little princess.

327
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:30,067
He was better than other dads.

328
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:33,278
And he thought I was better
than other daughters.

329
00:27:35,697 --> 00:27:40,202
- Until...
- You had the audacity to grow up.

330
00:27:40,994 --> 00:27:44,164
Fucking apologies for the surprise, Dad.

331
00:27:44,998 --> 00:27:47,084
He saw what he raised.

332
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:48,919
A woman he couldn't control.

333
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:51,922
Who didn't need anyone
else’s approval.

334
00:27:52,005 --> 00:27:54,758
Nothing deadlier to the fragile male ego.

335
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:02,516
He was the one who told
me I could be anything.

336
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:04,935
And I believed him.

337
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:08,522
But he didn’t tell you that
the world makes you choose.

338
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:11,358
You can be one of the smart ones.

339
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:16,238
Or one of the pretty ones.
Or even a strong one. But…

340
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:17,865
Try to be all three,

341
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:21,952
better learn to smile and shut up,

342
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,872
‘cause the second you're you,

343
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:26,915
the second

344
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:30,252
out loud, pissed off,

345
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:34,214
it's, "What a bitch," "What a slut,"

346
00:28:34,298 --> 00:28:37,301
"Who the fuck does she think she is?"

347
00:28:39,136 --> 00:28:41,471
So you never give them the chance.

348
00:28:41,555 --> 00:28:43,807
You hit first.

349
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:48,061
And anyone dumb enough to hit back
soon finds that there's no hurting you,

350
00:28:48,145 --> 00:28:52,900
sheathed in all that
hard, glossy armor.

351
00:28:52,983 --> 00:28:55,861
Then why does it hurt so much?

352
00:28:58,238 --> 00:29:01,867
Why does it feel like
I’m losing my mind, Eliot?

353
00:29:04,077 --> 00:29:09,249
Wind and sand reduce
mountains into rubble.

354
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:12,169
Are you stronger than a mountain?

355
00:29:14,713 --> 00:29:16,673
I'm a King.

356
00:29:17,466 --> 00:29:20,219
Not a goddamn princess.

357
00:29:21,053 --> 00:29:22,679
A King.

358
00:29:24,139 --> 00:29:25,474
You were.

359
00:29:27,935 --> 00:29:29,811
I'm still a King.

360
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:35,359
King of Manipulation.

361
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:38,362
King of Pointless Rage.

362
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:41,406
King of I Can't Do This.

363
00:29:42,032 --> 00:29:44,159
King of He Was Right.

364
00:29:47,204 --> 00:29:49,623
King of
I Eventually Fuck Up Everything.

365
00:29:49,706 --> 00:29:52,751
- That's not true.
- That’s what Eliot would say.

366
00:29:52,835 --> 00:29:55,254
But you're not Eliot, are you?

367
00:29:56,922 --> 00:29:58,257
You're me.

368
00:29:59,925 --> 00:30:02,261
And we know.

369
00:30:02,344 --> 00:30:05,055
Margo, don’t.

370
00:30:06,557 --> 00:30:08,141
Get angry?

371
00:30:10,185 --> 00:30:12,020
I am angry.

372
00:30:12,104 --> 00:30:14,064
Every second.

373
00:30:15,274 --> 00:30:17,442
Every second my eyes are open.

374
00:30:17,526 --> 00:30:20,070
Because I know who I am,

375
00:30:20,737 --> 00:30:22,281
not what I pretend to be.

376
00:30:24,366 --> 00:30:26,702
Can't do anything
except pose and judge.

377
00:30:26,785 --> 00:30:29,580
Margo. You have to stop.

378
00:30:31,415 --> 00:30:35,085
The only thing I ever did
right was be your best friend.

379
00:30:36,628 --> 00:30:39,882
That’s the only thing
I ever got right.

380
00:30:39,965 --> 00:30:41,675
And I can’t even do that.

381
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:45,637
Or else this fucking bag
would be fucking full!

382
00:31:26,428 --> 00:31:27,554
Wait.

383
00:31:30,098 --> 00:31:31,850
You’re a girl?

384
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:37,356
Sorry. Woman. Female.

385
00:31:38,565 --> 00:31:40,692
And how am I hearing you?

386
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:44,905
You're in my thoughts.

387
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:46,782
Who isn't?

388
00:31:47,491 --> 00:31:48,909
- Are you getting this?
- Yeah, of course.

389
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,952
Of course.

390
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:55,249
So then maybe you can tell me,
if you're a woman-ish thing,

391
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:59,545
why do you do such shitty
things to other women?

392
00:32:02,297 --> 00:32:03,423
What?

393
00:32:05,676 --> 00:32:07,386
Fuck.

394
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:10,430
Last one.

395
00:32:10,514 --> 00:32:11,598
It doesn’t work.

396
00:32:11,682 --> 00:32:13,475
Goddammit.

397
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:17,229
Come on.

398
00:32:22,067 --> 00:32:23,819
You may enter.

399
00:32:24,987 --> 00:32:27,364
Aengus, or Enyalius
whatever your name is.

400
00:32:27,447 --> 00:32:29,616
Do we… we’re too late. Shit. Shit.

401
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:34,246
Oh, your face.

402
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:36,290
- What the hell, dude?
- We were trying to warn you.

403
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:39,626
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I got you good.

404
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:42,880
Your anxieties are glowing.

405
00:32:42,963 --> 00:32:44,256
This one especially.

406
00:32:44,339 --> 00:32:48,385
The Monster is coming for you.
The one that you locked up in Blackspire.

407
00:32:48,468 --> 00:32:52,097
You care for a snack? Something to drink?
I mean, you've certainly earned it.

408
00:32:52,181 --> 00:32:54,892
No, no. We…we want you to leave.

409
00:32:54,975 --> 00:32:57,144
I have a place to hide,

410
00:32:57,227 --> 00:33:01,064
I just refuse to let
your panic infect me.

411
00:33:01,899 --> 00:33:03,442
Happiness is a choice, you know.

412
00:33:03,525 --> 00:33:05,444
Yeah, well,
you should turn the panic up.

413
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:07,362
We wasted so much time
in your escape room shit,

414
00:33:07,446 --> 00:33:09,281
the Monster could be here
any second.

415
00:33:13,368 --> 00:33:16,622
You mortals are always
so precious about time.

416
00:33:16,705 --> 00:33:19,917
"Ahh! Ooh!
There's never enough of it, aaah!"

417
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,170
"Every second I'm closer to
death, aaah!"

418
00:33:23,253 --> 00:33:25,130
Well, yes.

419
00:33:25,214 --> 00:33:29,092
How can you enjoy life if you're
in constant fear of its end?

420
00:33:29,176 --> 00:33:30,552
Think on it.

421
00:33:30,636 --> 00:33:32,429
Except you of course.

422
00:33:32,513 --> 00:33:33,680
Julia,

423
00:33:35,557 --> 00:33:37,392
it’s a fascinating pleasure.

424
00:33:37,476 --> 00:33:40,896
Look, we're trying to save you.
You need to hide, now.

425
00:33:43,524 --> 00:33:47,110
Yes, it took me a while to
shake the mortal fear, too.

426
00:33:48,153 --> 00:33:50,030
You'll get there.

427
00:33:51,532 --> 00:33:53,492
So that's a no on the snacks?

428
00:33:55,035 --> 00:33:58,580
I did hope that the decoy
and alias would keep him at bay.

429
00:33:58,664 --> 00:34:00,082
But just in case,

430
00:34:02,334 --> 00:34:03,877
a fallout shelter of sorts.

431
00:34:03,961 --> 00:34:06,797
No one, not even the
Monster, can get in.

432
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,175
It's going to be so very
boring, but,

433
00:34:11,844 --> 00:34:13,679
since you insist.

434
00:34:13,762 --> 00:34:14,638
Thank God.

435
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:16,849
You're most welcome.

436
00:34:16,932 --> 00:34:18,433
But before I, um…

437
00:34:18,517 --> 00:34:19,768
Jesus Christ.

438
00:34:21,019 --> 00:34:22,354
Julia.

439
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:25,315
- Come with me.
- What?

440
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:28,485
I know a thing or
two about god powers.

441
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:31,280
Sure I can fix whatever's
wrong with you.

442
00:34:33,824 --> 00:34:36,118
We're more alike than you know.

443
00:34:38,954 --> 00:34:40,956
Think it over.

444
00:34:42,457 --> 00:34:46,670
Whilst I remember my password.

445
00:34:56,972 --> 00:34:59,433
So can we do this thing? Or what?

446
00:34:59,516 --> 00:35:00,809
I don’t mean to be brusk.

447
00:35:00,893 --> 00:35:04,021
- Do what?
- Turn my black sand into axes.

448
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,902
Guys, whatever the joke is, skip it.

449
00:35:09,985 --> 00:35:11,320
It's just so...

450
00:35:11,403 --> 00:35:13,822
Richly enjoyable!
Not to mention, a first!

451
00:35:13,906 --> 00:35:16,783
You should feel good at least,

452
00:35:16,867 --> 00:35:19,536
no other woman has ever
gone alone out there

453
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,872
and come back with all of that.

454
00:35:21,955 --> 00:35:24,208
- Most give up.
- Or die.

455
00:35:25,209 --> 00:35:26,919
Yeah, hilarious.

456
00:35:27,794 --> 00:35:30,172
I can't believe your
kingdom exiled you.

457
00:35:30,255 --> 00:35:33,050
You're strong. Smart.

458
00:35:34,843 --> 00:35:36,970
And a very adequate whore.

459
00:35:37,054 --> 00:35:39,056
Oh yeah, it’s a big uh-oh.

460
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:43,185
You know.
Funny thing happened out there.

461
00:35:43,268 --> 00:35:45,687
I met one of them. A "demon spirit"?

462
00:35:46,355 --> 00:35:49,900
And I got the whole download
on how this place really rolls.

463
00:35:50,943 --> 00:35:54,905
See, I lost my shit in a big way.

464
00:35:54,988 --> 00:35:59,660
And she came up out of the sand,
only, I didn't see shifty scary smoke.

465
00:36:00,536 --> 00:36:02,329
I saw her.

466
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:07,000
Maybe it's this weirdo
fairy eye I have.

467
00:36:07,084 --> 00:36:10,546
It’s a long and very bizarre
story for another day

468
00:36:10,629 --> 00:36:12,840
and another quest.

469
00:36:14,091 --> 00:36:16,134
But I also heard her.

470
00:36:16,885 --> 00:36:20,764
She didn't attack me,
that's not what they do.

471
00:36:20,848 --> 00:36:22,808
But you guys already know
that, don't you?

472
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:26,895
You and your whole ruling council
of pussy-phobic chuckle-dicks.

473
00:36:26,979 --> 00:36:28,564
Because those spirts,

474
00:36:28,647 --> 00:36:32,359
when they hear a woman
who's sad or scared or upset

475
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:35,237
or angry,

476
00:36:36,488 --> 00:36:39,199
they rise up out of
the sand to help.

477
00:36:40,534 --> 00:36:44,746
And they help by possessing
whatever man is causing the distress.

478
00:36:47,082 --> 00:36:48,417
They're protectors.

479
00:36:50,252 --> 00:36:52,629
And if the problem isn't a man,

480
00:36:55,465 --> 00:36:58,760
they do whatever it takes
to help women.

481
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:17,237
If your intent is to tell
our people those lies,

482
00:37:17,321 --> 00:37:20,866
then I'm sorry
but that’s not gonna happen.

483
00:37:22,743 --> 00:37:24,912
If your intent was
to double-cross me,

484
00:37:24,995 --> 00:37:28,123
you missed a key plot
point, shit-crisp.

485
00:37:28,207 --> 00:37:30,584
I'm a fucking magician.

486
00:39:23,071 --> 00:39:24,740
Aren't you going to use the axes?

487
00:39:24,823 --> 00:39:26,491
No.

488
00:39:26,575 --> 00:39:29,328
Tell the spirits to
exit your husband.

489
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:32,122
They serve you. All of you.

490
00:39:32,206 --> 00:39:35,626
C'mon, ladies, it’s time to get
your “head out of the sand.”

491
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:36,627
Literally.

492
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:39,796
Close your eyes, think the thought.

493
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,881
Leave my husband.

494
00:39:54,728 --> 00:39:58,190
She's talking to me.

495
00:40:00,317 --> 00:40:03,111
From now on if a demon
possesses a man or a woman

496
00:40:03,195 --> 00:40:04,863
you can just tell them to leave.

497
00:40:04,947 --> 00:40:07,115
Or stay and finish them off.

498
00:40:07,199 --> 00:40:10,327
Or help with the laundry.
They're pretty handy.

499
00:40:19,753 --> 00:40:20,629
Hey.

500
00:40:25,175 --> 00:40:26,385
This isn't over.

501
00:40:27,302 --> 00:40:29,888
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

502
00:40:31,223 --> 00:40:34,476
I'm gonna figure out whatever the hell
this Binder is all about

503
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,770
and become a goddess again.

504
00:40:37,437 --> 00:40:39,481
Okay. It’s not gonna make a difference.

505
00:40:39,565 --> 00:40:42,901
There's a ton of reasons it won't,
but when has that stopped us?

506
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:47,865
Once I finally get this
goddess shit straight,

507
00:40:47,948 --> 00:40:49,449
I need you

508
00:40:51,451 --> 00:40:55,122
to help remind me what it's like
to give a shit about other people.

509
00:40:56,164 --> 00:40:58,709
To want to risk your life
to save them.

510
00:41:06,383 --> 00:41:07,718
I got it.

511
00:41:14,183 --> 00:41:15,475
May I come in?

512
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:25,277
Look who's up, Trump and Aunt Lydia.

513
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,321
Welcome to the New Desert Order.

514
00:41:27,404 --> 00:41:29,406
It’s gonna suck for you.

515
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:13,116
Nice song, asshole.

516
00:42:26,255 --> 00:42:30,843
Look, I know you're just
a reptilian hallucination

517
00:42:34,972 --> 00:42:36,849
but I miss you.

518
00:42:38,475 --> 00:42:40,102
So much.

519
00:42:42,187 --> 00:42:44,273
And I promise you.

520
00:42:45,941 --> 00:42:48,026
I'm gonna get you back.

521
00:43:25,731 --> 00:43:29,648
