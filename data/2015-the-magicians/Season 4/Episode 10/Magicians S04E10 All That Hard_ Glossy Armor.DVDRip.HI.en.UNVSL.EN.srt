He only liked them when
they were too weak to fight.

He's not trying to
rebuild his body.

That's not what the stones are.

24

aren't for building a body,

27
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:12,715
what does he want with them?

28
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,733
No, he's building
a body. His sister's.

her back to life.

Oh, my God.

31
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:24,976
That's the girl he thought was a sacrifice
to summon Enyalius, but she wasn't.

32
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:26,563
Enyalius and the
other gods killed her.

33
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:29,250
They chopped her up and
turned her into four stone organs.

Jesus. There's
two of them. Yeah.

35
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,486
And if he got prison and
she got the death penalty,

36
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:36,052
I'm guessing she's the bad one.

37

wearing a ring, emerald.

180
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:46,173
Guy is described up and
down, but nothing about the ring.

181
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:47,423
Wait a minute. Did
you say emerald?

182
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:48,447
Yeah.

183
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,513
When I did research
with the Free Traders,

184
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:54,349
there was this god.
What was his name? Uh...

185
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:57,256
He... He always
worked in disguise,

186
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:01,260
but he was known for always
wearing an emerald ring.

187
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,819
So Enyalius is a front.

188
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:05,092
JULIA: Here.

189
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,292
Aengus.

190
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,824
Celtic god.

191
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:14,130
Jules, it says here
he's a trickster. It's fine.

192
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:17,439
And we... It wouldn't
be a summoning.

193
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,979
We can only get to him
through a magical creature.

194
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,810
Apparently there's
a whole species

195
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:24,783
that exists to entertain
him and protect him.

196
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,912
And they're really
annoying and...

197
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:31,389
What I'm getting at is, we
need to find a leprechaun.

198
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,551
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

199
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:53,273
Don't! I'm sorry.

200
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:56,441
Listen, I... I just saw
this red sand out there.

201
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:57,609
It was following me.

202
00:11:57,684 --> 00:11:59,812
I thought it was 'cause
I was tripping balls.

203
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:01,846
Our desert is alive.

204
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:05,057
It's filled with demon spirits
that attack our women.

205
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:08,288
Okay.

206
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:11,422
Speaking of D-spirits,
I'm looking for something

207
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:13,796
I think you guys have. MAN:
You know what can happen.

208
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,077
A pair of black... WOMAN:
You're angry with me?

209
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,763
How dare you?

210
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,181
You lay with my sister, and
I'm the one you scream at?

211
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:20,696
I'm the one you threaten?

212
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:23,265
Zal, calm yourself. Pig!

213
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,187
You want my sister? She's yours.

214
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,270
Wow.

215
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:28,013
Desert Dynasty.

216
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,811
Think we're gonna
get a girl fight?

217
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:32,147
Jesus, how long
does one lick last?

218
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:34,517
Take her. You two
deserve each other.

219
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,352
You must be silent!
Now. (WHOOSHING)

220
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:40,584
(GASPS)

221
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,057
(SCREAMING)

222
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:49,967
(GRUNTS) (MAN SCREAMS)

223
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:51,903
Gross.

224
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:55,502
But cool, but gross.

225
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:56,804
(GROANING)

226
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:02,949
(GRUNTS)

227
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:21,097
So, anytime a woman
gets a teensy bit emotional,

228
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:24,035
one of those things rises
up out of the sand, and what?

229
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,228
Possesses her.

230
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,870
Eventually causing
paralysis, even death.

231
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:32,173
Men save us because they
alone have the strength to survive.

232
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:34,305
And the spirit
zoo you got going?

233
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,746
They can't be killed,

234
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,681
so I've learned how
to imprison them.

235
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,251
Some brave dudes.

236
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,112
And some awfully
compliant women.

237
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,962
You're not seeing or
hearing this, are you?

238
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,793
Seeing or hearing...

239
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:57,102
I thought so.

240
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,436
Man, this lizard's got
a half-life like uranium.

241
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,999
So the guy with the axes,
which tent's he hang his thong in?

242
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:08,372
Have we identified the leader
of the Serpent group yet?

243
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,313
Not yet, but we're looking.

244
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,708
Where?

245
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:15,118
Phyllis is in charge
of that investigation.

246
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:17,922
I could join her.

247
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,835
Perhaps there are places
she doesn't know to look

248
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,590
that I would,
considering my past.

249
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:24,563
That's a very generous offer.

250
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,535
But it seems that you have
enough on your plate already.

251
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,163
Hmm.

252
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:32,296
Very well.

253
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,840
MARGO: I was
just sitting in a bar

254
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:36,375
when a bear named
Humbledrum started talking to me.

255
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:39,537
What can I tell you?
Fillory's a weird place.

256
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:40,970
So I hear.

257
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:42,981
But you... Mmm-hmm.

258
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,915
A woman... Mmm-hmm.

259
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:47,215
As king? Talking animals.

260
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,195
I'm gonna go get some more.

261
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:14,746
ELIOT: Wow.

262
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:16,544
Light speed, Bambi.

263
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:19,318
Okay, can you just tell me?

264
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:20,978
What the hell are you?

265
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:22,578
Pieces of you.

266
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,315
Your spirit guide.

267
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,189
Your memories. Your Eliot.

268
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,084
Your conscience.

269
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:32,894
Speaking of
conscience... Wait, what?

270
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,558
You're really gonna
pass lycanthropy

271
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:36,694
to a guy who lives on a
planet with two moons?

272
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,113
I'll tell them I'm surfing
the red breakers,

273
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:39,217
and we got to get creative.

274
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,104
And this is just
to get the axes.

275
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:43,642
Out, now. (MUSIC PLAYING)

276
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,280
And this is guiding me how?

277
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:56,078
It's the song you think to yourself
whenever you're working a guy, remember?

278
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,650
High school, junior year?

279
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,792
Ray Latanza. Ray Latanza.

280
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:03,056
Yeah. Yeah.

281
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,893
This song came
out on the car radio.

282
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,729
I wanted to ride in his Porsche,
so I gave him a hand job.

283
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,928
In your own
driveway, which is sad,

284
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:11,282
'cause then your dad walked out.

285
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,431
Okay, road closure
on Memory Lane.

286
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:18,042
(SINGING) <i>I don't
know where I'm going</i>

287
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:23,245
<i>But I sure know where I've been</i>

288
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:29,248
BOTH: <i>Hanging on the
promises in the songs of yesterday</i>

289
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:33,084
<i>'Cause I've made up my mind</i>

290
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:37,592
<i>I ain't wasting no more time</i>

291
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,326
ALL: <i>Here I go again</i>

292
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:45,129
<i>Here I go again</i>

293
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:46,797
Hey, Margo. Thanks
for inviting me.

294
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:48,102
I invited her?

295
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:53,177
(SINGING) <i>Though I keep
searching for an answer</i>

296
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:59,309
<i>I never seem to find
what I'm looking for</i>

297
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:04,517
<i>O Lord, I pray You give
me the strength to carry on</i>

298
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:09,295
ELIOT AND FEN: <i>'Cause
I know what it means</i>

299
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:13,026
<i>To walk along the
lonely street of dreams</i>

300
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:19,161
<i>Here I go again on my own</i>

301
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:23,676
<i>Going down the only
road I've ever known</i>

302
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:28,478
JOSH AND FEN: <i>Like a
drifter, I was born to walk alone</i>

303
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:34,617
<i>And I made up my mind</i>

00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:38,658
<i>I ain't wasting no more time</i>

305
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:46,261
The Library says that they have
sufficient levels of ambient magic.

306
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,966
Magic output reports
are published weekly.

307
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:52,733
Yeah, well, we didn't
trust them, and guess what.

308
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,366
Look.

309
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,536
This is how much magic the Library
says is being distributed as ambient.

310
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:02,544
And this is the level
in the pipes right now.

311
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:07,082
It's nothing close to the amount
of magic they say there is.

312
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:12,152
So long as Library members
get their Deweys, who cares?

313
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,291
Beside hedges.

314
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:16,692
That can't be right. It is.

315
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:18,988
We bugged the pipes.

316
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:22,492
A beetle with
McCormick's tracer.

317
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,336
Were you mapping
the pipe system?

318
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,270
Trying to.

319
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:30,902
Until our beetle disintegrated
somewhere outside Earth.

320
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:33,003
But the spell
shows magic levels.

321
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:35,119
And when we saw this, we
thought we should show you,

322
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,547
because I don't
think you signed up

323
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:39,882
to work for an
organization that lies, right?

324
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,387
I'm sure there's an
explanation. There is.

325
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,550
Harriet told you and me.

326
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,220
Everett's trying to
squeeze out hedges.

327
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,058
This is just more of the same.

328
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,360
Look, you are on the inside.

329
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,233
You can find out where
the extra magic is going

330
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:59,636
and why they're hoarding it
and why the Library is lying.

331
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,199
Mmm.

332
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:05,237
MARGO: Yeah, sweetie.
Just let me borrow them.

333
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:08,247
I'll have them back in
a day, two at the most.

334
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:12,782
No one else can use
them but me. Mmm!

335
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,443
They're enchanted.

336
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,718
As I'm sure you can
understand better than most.

337
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:20,755
I, uh... (CHUCKLES)

338
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:23,658
I loved it last night when
you did that thing to me.

339
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:29,201
(SIGHS) What are
you, some kind of witch?

340
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:30,802
Magician.

341
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,639
So can I get ones
that work for me?

342
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,505
You'll have to make your own.

343
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:37,065
Swell. How?

344
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:48,280
Mostly white, no?

345
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,080
But every hundredth
grain or so...

346
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,260
Is black.

347
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:56,895
Mmm.

348
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,298
A warrior goes
alone into the desert,

349
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:01,967
picks out only the black ones,

350
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,504
enough to fill a large bag,

351
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:06,767
which is then forged.

352
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:08,573
Thanks.

353
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:12,139
