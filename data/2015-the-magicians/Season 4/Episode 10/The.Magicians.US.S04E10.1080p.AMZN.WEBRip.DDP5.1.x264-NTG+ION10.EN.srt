1
00:00:05,992 --> 00:00:07,554
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:07,601 --> 00:00:08,944
My mother was a hedge witch, too.

3
00:00:08,983 --> 00:00:10,677
I didn't know you were a hedge.

4
00:00:10,702 --> 00:00:13,662
Oh, yes. My mentor, Everett, found me.

5
00:00:18,883 --> 00:00:20,420
_

6
00:00:20,506 --> 00:00:21,827
_

7
00:00:22,538 --> 00:00:24,754
_

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,991
The Foremost saved them
with special weapons

9
00:00:28,016 --> 00:00:29,389
that expel possession.

10
00:00:29,414 --> 00:00:30,616
They call them ice axes,

11
00:00:30,641 --> 00:00:32,171
and I'm assuming that's poetic license.

12
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,076
So we might have a chance to save Eliot.

13
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:37,291
Overthrow me right the fuck now, Fen.

14
00:00:37,316 --> 00:00:39,713
- I never should have...
- Or I will never forgive you.

15
00:00:39,738 --> 00:00:42,025
And neither will Eliot
if you keep me from getting

16
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,605
the one thing that can save him.

17
00:00:47,037 --> 00:00:49,598
When the going gets tough,
the tough listens

18
00:00:49,623 --> 00:00:50,950
to pop anthems from the '80s.

19
00:00:50,975 --> 00:00:53,377
Hi. It's me.

20
00:00:53,411 --> 00:00:54,579
It's the real me. It's Eliot.

21
00:00:54,604 --> 00:00:56,192
This is a mind palace situation,

22
00:00:56,217 --> 00:00:57,227
and we don't have a lot of time,

23
00:00:57,252 --> 00:00:58,783
and I have some extremely
major shit to tell you.

24
00:00:58,816 --> 00:01:00,876
Some god of war.

25
00:01:00,951 --> 00:01:03,921
He only liked them when they
were too weak to fight.

26
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,882
He's not trying to rebuild his body.

27
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:08,385
That's not what the stones are.
That's not what they're for.

28
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,905
It's so much worse than that.

29
00:01:13,456 --> 00:01:14,791
Just breathe.

30
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,585
If the stones aren't
for building a body,

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,823
what does he want with them?

32
00:01:17,857 --> 00:01:21,628
No, he's building a body...
his sister's.

33
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:23,930
He's trying to bring her back to life.

34
00:01:23,962 --> 00:01:25,631
Oh, my God.

35
00:01:25,664 --> 00:01:28,367
That's the girl
he thought was a sacrifice

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,822
to summon Enyalius, but she wasn't.

37
00:01:29,902 --> 00:01:31,704
Enyalius and the other gods killed her.

38
00:01:31,738 --> 00:01:34,406
They chopped her up and turned
her into four stone organs.

39
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:37,576
- Jesus. There's two of them.
- Yeah.

40
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,679
And if he got prison and she
got the death penalty,

41
00:01:39,712 --> 00:01:41,430
I'm guessing she's the bad one.

42
00:01:41,455 --> 00:01:43,532
Till he remembers,
he won't know to go looking

43
00:01:43,557 --> 00:01:44,571
for Enyalius.

44
00:01:47,977 --> 00:01:49,893
Hi.

45
00:01:50,155 --> 00:01:53,526
If you want to talk to me,
the price is a drink.

46
00:01:53,643 --> 00:01:55,512
You're fun.

47
00:01:57,897 --> 00:02:00,548
One drink.

48
00:02:00,932 --> 00:02:03,204
- What are you having, ma'am?
- Vodka ice.

49
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:05,329
Vodka ice.

50
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,700
There you go.

51
00:02:11,435 --> 00:02:14,572
- I have a question.
- No, I don't come here often.

52
00:02:14,597 --> 00:02:16,034
You haven't seen me anywhere.

53
00:02:16,073 --> 00:02:18,542
And, yes, I do have plans this weekend.

54
00:02:18,575 --> 00:02:20,678
Still have a question?

55
00:02:21,236 --> 00:02:22,586
Yes.

56
00:02:23,347 --> 00:02:27,001
Why does this place smell like death?

57
00:02:32,256 --> 00:02:34,692
It is weird, right?

58
00:02:34,724 --> 00:02:37,595
Bar next to a hospital.

59
00:02:37,627 --> 00:02:40,797
Doctors need happy hour, too, I guess.

60
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:44,535
So that's what you are? A doctor?

61
00:02:44,567 --> 00:02:46,336
No.

62
00:02:47,604 --> 00:02:50,307
I'm sick.

63
00:02:50,341 --> 00:02:52,410
But I got good news today.

64
00:02:52,442 --> 00:02:55,645
I'll only be sick
for another two months.

65
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:57,282
Three, maybe.

66
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,319
Sometimes my friend says one thing

67
00:03:02,353 --> 00:03:05,030
but means another thing.

68
00:03:05,622 --> 00:03:08,077
Is that what you're doing?

69
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:10,627
Keep them coming.

70
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:12,330

- Her wrist.

147
00:09:07,966 --> 00:09:10,247

148
00:09:11,202 --> 00:09:13,052
My face.

149
00:09:13,771 --> 00:09:15,173
Touch my face.

150
00:09:17,816 --> 00:09:19,451
Are you okay?

151
00:09:21,947 --> 00:09:25,233
Whenever you touch my face,
I remember something.

152
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,288
Again.

153
00:09:34,092 --> 00:09:38,096
You remind me of someone
I had forgotten...

154
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,932
my sister.

155
00:09:39,965 --> 00:09:41,067
I'm gonna leave.

156
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,702
No, you have to come with me now.

157
00:09:43,736 --> 00:09:46,105
No, I'm...

158
00:09:54,245 --> 00:09:55,981
What's up?

159
00:09:56,014 --> 00:09:58,017
This was in the Mirror World.

160
00:09:58,049 --> 00:10:00,885
And I heard you were looking
for the binder, so...

161
00:10:01,923 --> 00:10:04,289
Holy shit.

162
00:10:04,322 --> 00:10:06,837
It's in some language
I've never seen before. I...

163
00:10:06,891 --> 00:10:09,761
Well, um, I'll get on this just as soon

164
00:10:09,794 --> 00:10:11,096
as we find Enyalius.

165
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,231
Hopefully before the Monster does.

166
00:10:13,264 --> 00:10:15,835
I-I thought we wanted him
to find Enyalius.

167
00:10:15,867 --> 00:10:18,103
Yeah, we did, but we were wrong.

168
00:10:18,136 --> 00:10:19,738
He's building his sister.

169
00:10:21,206 --> 00:10:23,109
What are y'all doing?

170
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:26,526
Tracking the Library's entire
magic infrastructure

171
00:10:26,551 --> 00:10:29,332
to find weak points
and start a rebellion.

172
00:10:30,014 --> 00:10:33,151
But, um, good luck with yours.

173
00:10:33,184 --> 00:10:35,854
Yeah. Thanks. You too.

174
00:10:35,888 --> 00:10:37,498
Yeah, I can tell you what he looks like,

175
00:10:37,523 --> 00:10:39,459
the food the dude likes to eat,

176
00:10:39,484 --> 00:10:42,060
but shit-all for anything useful.

177
00:10:42,093 --> 00:10:43,764
One thing is bugging me.

178
00:10:43,789 --> 00:10:47,066
In the memory, I-I could swear
he was wearing a ring... emerald.

179
00:10:47,098 --> 00:10:51,147
Guy is described up and down,
but nothing about the ring.

180
00:10:51,172 --> 00:10:52,833
Wait a minute. Did you say emerald?

181
00:10:52,858 --> 00:10:53,839
Yeah.

182
00:10:53,871 --> 00:10:56,397
W-when I did research
with the Free Traders,

183
00:10:56,422 --> 00:10:58,811
there... there was this god.
What was his name?

184
00:10:58,851 --> 00:11:02,546
Uh, he... he always worked
in disguise, but...

185
00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:06,151
but he was known for always
wearing an emerald ring.

186
00:11:06,176 --> 00:11:08,879
So Enyalius is a front.

187
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,155
Here.

188
00:11:10,188 --> 00:11:12,791
Aengus.

189
00:11:12,825 --> 00:11:13,959
Celtic god.

190
00:11:16,327 --> 00:11:19,197
- Jules, it says here he's a Trickster.
- It's fine.

191
00:11:19,223 --> 00:11:22,776
And we... it wouldn't be a summoning.

192
00:11:22,801 --> 00:11:24,970
We can only get to him
through a magical creature.

193
00:11:25,003 --> 00:11:27,316
Apparently there's
a whole species that exists

194
00:11:27,341 --> 00:11:29,408
to entertain him and protect him.

195
00:11:29,441 --> 00:11:32,318
And they're really annoying and...

196
00:11:32,944 --> 00:11:36,732
What I'm getting at is we need
to find a leprechaun.

197
00:11:56,168 --> 00:11:58,169
- Don't!
- I'm sorry.

198
00:11:58,202 --> 00:12:01,139
Listen, I-I just saw
this red sand out there.

199
00:12:01,173 --> 00:12:02,908
It was following me.

200
00:12:02,941 --> 00:12:05,344
I thought it was 'cause
I was tripping balls.

201
00:12:05,376 --> 00:12:07,212
Our desert is alive.

202
00:12:07,245 --> 00:12:10,115
It's filled with demon spirits
that attack our women.

203
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:13,318
Okay.

204
00:12:13,351 --> 00:12:16,255
Speaking of D-spirits,
I'm looking for something

205
00:12:16,288 --> 00:12:19,812
I think you guys have...
a pair of black...

206
00:12:19,844 --> 00:12:22,033
You're angry with me? How dare you?

207
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:24,382
You lay with my sister,
and I'm the one you scream at?

208
00:12:24,407 --> 00:12:25,819
I'm the one you threaten?

209
00:12:25,844 --> 00:12:28,933
- Zal, calm yourself.
- Pig!

210
00:12:28,966 --> 00:12:30,937
You want my sister? She's yours.

211
00:12:30,962 --> 00:12:33,005
Wow. "Desert Dynasty."

212
00:12:33,038 --> 00:12:34,874
Think we're gonna get a girl fight?

213
00:12:34,907 --> 00:12:37,109
Jesus, how long does one lick last?

214
00:12:37,141 --> 00:12:39,605
Take her. You two deserve each other.

215
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,288
You must be silent! Now.

216
00:12:54,426 --> 00:12:56,550
Ooh. Gross.

217
00:12:57,826 --> 00:13:00,780
But cool, but gross.

218
00:13:21,286 --> 00:13:25,857
So, anytime a woman gets
a teensy bit emotional,

219
00:13:25,882 --> 00:13:28,819
one of those things rises up
out of the sand, and what?

220
00:13:28,859 --> 00:13:30,962
Possesses her...

221
00:13:30,996 --> 00:13:33,298
eventually causing paralysis,
even death.

222
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,481
Men save us because they alone
have the strength to survive.

223
00:13:36,528 --> 00:13:38,898
And the spirit zoo you got going?

224
00:13:38,924 --> 00:13:40,225
They can't be killed,

225
00:13:40,257 --> 00:13:42,960
so I've learned how to imprison them.

226
00:13:43,037 --> 00:13:44,673
Some brave dudes.

227
00:13:44,762 --> 00:13:47,888
And some awfully compliant women.

228
00:13:53,369 --> 00:13:56,474
You're not seeing
or hearing this, are you?

229
00:13:57,774 --> 00:14:00,043
Seeing or hearing...?

230
00:14:00,076 --> 00:14:01,611
I thought so.

231
00:14:01,644 --> 00:14:04,749
Man, this lizard's got
a half-life like uranium.

232
00:14:04,782 --> 00:14:06,550
So the guy with the axes...

233
00:14:06,582 --> 00:14:09,586
which tent's he hang his thong in?

234
00:14:09,619 --> 00:14:12,722
Have we identified the leader
of the Serpent group yet?

235
00:14:12,755 --> 00:14:15,525
Not yet, but we're looking.

236
00:14:15,558 --> 00:14:17,093
Where?

237
00:14:17,127 --> 00:14:20,631
Phyllis is in charge
of that investigation.

238
00:14:20,663 --> 00:14:22,198
I could join her.

239
00:14:22,231 --> 00:14:24,367
Perhaps there are places
she doesn't know to look

240
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,037
that I would, considering my past.

241
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,584
That's a very generous offer.

242
00:14:30,673 --> 00:14:33,810
But it seems that you have
enough on your plate already.

243
00:14:35,571 --> 00:14:36,679
Very well.

244
00:14:36,733 --> 00:14:38,358
<i>I was just sitting in a bar</i>

245
00:14:38,383 --> 00:14:41,030
<i>when a bear named Humbledrum
started talking to me.</i>

246
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,187
What can I tell you?
Fillory's a weird place.

247
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,523
So I hear.

248
00:14:45,556 --> 00:14:47,388
- But you...
- Mm-hmm.

249
00:14:47,413 --> 00:14:49,460
- A woman...
- Mm-hmm.

250
00:14:49,493 --> 00:14:51,729
- As king?
- Talking animals.

251
00:14:51,762 --> 00:14:53,542
Mm.

252
00:15:05,676 --> 00:15:07,677
I'm gonna go get some more.

253
00:15:17,931 --> 00:15:20,935
Wow. Light speed, Bambi.

254
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,794
Okay, can you just tell me?

255
00:15:23,826 --> 00:15:25,462
What the hell are you?

256
00:15:25,495 --> 00:15:27,230
Pieces of you.

257
00:15:27,264 --> 00:15:28,798
Your spirit guide.

258
00:15:28,831 --> 00:15:32,135
Your memories. Your Eliot.

259
00:15:32,168 --> 00:15:33,636
Your conscience.

260
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:37,273
- Speaking of conscience...
- Wait, what?

261
00:15:37,307 --> 00:15:39,509
You're really gonna pass
lycanthropy to a guy

262
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:41,144
who lives on a planet with two moons?

263
00:15:41,177 --> 00:15:42,612
I'll tell them I'm surfing
the red breakers

264
00:15:42,645 --> 00:15:43,713
and we got to get creative.

265
00:15:43,746 --> 00:15:46,616
And this is just to get the axes.

266
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:48,151
Out, now.

267
00:15:52,623 --> 00:15:55,292
And this is guiding me how?

268
00:15:55,325 --> 00:15:57,595
It's the song you think to yourself

269
00:15:57,628 --> 00:16:00,564
whenever you're working a guy, remember?

270
00:16:00,596 --> 00:16:03,299
High school, junior year?

271
00:16:03,332 --> 00:16:06,202
- Ray Latanza.
- Ray Latanza.

272
00:16:06,235 --> 00:16:07,718
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

273
00:16:07,743 --> 00:16:09,273
This song came out on the car radio.

274
00:16:09,306 --> 00:16:10,812
I wanted to ride in his Porsche,

275
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:12,175
so I gave him a hand job.

276
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:14,617
In your own driveway, which is sad,

277
00:16:14,642 --> 00:16:15,778
'cause then your dad walked out.

278
00:16:15,812 --> 00:16:17,794

298
00:17:46,164 --> 00:17:49,467
The Library says that they
have sufficient levels

299
00:17:49,492 --> 00:17:51,708
of ambient magic.

300
00:17:51,742 --> 00:17:54,345
Magic output reports
are published weekly.

301
00:17:54,378 --> 00:17:57,014
Yeah, well, we didn't trust
them, and guess what.

302
00:17:57,046 --> 00:17:58,781
Look...

303
00:17:58,814 --> 00:18:00,985
this is how much magic the Library says

304
00:18:01,017 --> 00:18:03,586
is being distributed as ambient.

305
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:08,024
And this is the level
in the pipes right now.

306
00:18:08,058 --> 00:18:09,994
It's nothing close
to the amount of magic

307
00:18:10,026 --> 00:18:12,263
they say there is.

308
00:18:12,295 --> 00:18:14,965
So long as Library members
get their Deweys,

309
00:18:14,997 --> 00:18:16,600
who cares?

310
00:18:16,632 --> 00:18:18,901
Beside hedges.

311
00:18:18,935 --> 00:18:22,005
- That can't be right.
- It is.

312
00:18:22,383 --> 00:18:24,426
We bugged the pipes.

313
00:18:25,042 --> 00:18:27,100
A beetle with McCormick's Tracer.

314
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,753
Were you mapping the pipe system?

315
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,815
Trying to.

316
00:18:31,848 --> 00:18:35,351
Until our beetle disintegrated
somewhere outside Earth.

317
00:18:35,385 --> 00:18:37,439
But the spell shows magic levels.

318
00:18:37,472 --> 00:18:39,682
And when we saw this,
we thought we should show you,

319
00:18:39,707 --> 00:18:41,358
because I don't think you
signed up to work

320
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,182
for an organization that lies, right?

321
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:47,730
- I'm sure there's an explanation.
- There is.

322
00:18:47,764 --> 00:18:49,933
Harriet told you... and me.

323
00:18:49,965 --> 00:18:52,703
Everett's trying to squeeze out hedges.

324
00:18:52,735 --> 00:18:54,638
This is just more of the same.

325
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,975
Look, you are on the inside.

326
00:18:58,007 --> 00:19:00,554
You can find out where
the extra magic is going

327
00:19:00,609 --> 00:19:04,282
and why they're hoarding it
and why the Library is lying.

328
00:19:05,381 --> 00:19:07,051
Hmm.

329
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,777
Yeah, sweetie. Just let me borrow them.

330
00:19:09,802 --> 00:19:13,890
I'll have them back in a day,
two at the most.

331
00:19:13,924 --> 00:19:16,371
No one else can use them but me.

332
00:19:16,396 --> 00:19:18,962
- Mm.
- They're enchanted.

333
00:19:18,994 --> 00:19:22,398
As I'm sure you can understand
better than most.

334
00:19:22,431 --> 00:19:25,101
I, uh...

335
00:19:25,642 --> 00:19:28,619
I loved it last night
when you did that thing to me.

336
00:19:29,713 --> 00:19:33,983
Ah, what are you, some kind of... witch?

337
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:36,113
Magician.

338
00:19:36,146 --> 00:19:38,407
So can I get ones that work for me?

339
00:19:38,432 --> 00:19:39,917
You'll have to make your own.

340
00:19:39,949 --> 00:19:41,718
Swell. How?

341
00:19:50,994 --> 00:19:53,530
Mostly white, no?

342
00:19:53,562 --> 00:19:55,999
But every hundredth grain or so...

343
00:19:58,467 --> 00:19:59,902
Is black.

344
00:19:59,936 --> 00:20:01,371
Mm.

345
00:20:01,405 --> 00:20:03,917
A warrior goes alone in the desert,

346
00:20:04,448 --> 00:20:06,377
picks out only the black ones...

347
00:20:06,878 --> 00:20:09,012
enough to fill a large bag,

348
00:20:09,582 --> 00:20:11,985
which is then forged.

349
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,180
Thanks.

350
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:15,414
You're gonna try?

351
00:20:15,446 --> 00:20:17,120
I'm gonna do.

352
00:20:17,154 --> 00:20:19,123
If you get the least bit emotional,

353
00:20:19,156 --> 00:20:21,125
the spirits will possess you.

354
00:20:21,158 --> 00:20:22,725
Clear on that.

355
00:20:22,758 --> 00:20:24,761
And there'll be no man to protect you.

356
00:20:24,794 --> 00:20:27,797
- Story of my life.
- And you can't use magic.

Uh, we were hoping that you
could help us find somebody.

389
00:22:30,692 --> 00:22:31,950
Well, I'm not sure about that,

390

00:22:37,429 --> 00:22:38,824

I'm Berry, so...

We're looking for a leprechaun.

395
00:22:46,141 --> 00:22:47,819
Right.

396
00:22:47,844 --> 00:22:50,949
So are you looking for, like,
a "pot of gold" leprechaun,

397
00:22:50,974 --> 00:22:53,450
or is this a breakfast-cereal
situation, or..

398
00:22:53,475 --> 00:22:55,005
We're looking for a god named Aengus,

399
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,747
but to find him we have to talk
to a leprechaun first,

400
00:22:56,817 --> 00:22:59,474
and I know this
is a bat-shit thing to say

401
00:22:59,528 --> 00:23:01,905
with a straight face,
but if you could help us...

402
00:23:03,657 --> 00:23:06,861
Well, all right, since you're desperate.

403
00:23:06,894 --> 00:23:08,663

00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:09,812
What do you expect...

405
00:23:09,837 --> 00:23:11,943

in overalls

406
00:23:11,968 --> 00:23:13,067
with a buckle on me hat?

407
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:14,736
Why didn't you just tell us?

408
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:17,740
Because you're hysterical
when you're desperate.

409
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,014

410
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,657

Great. No knob.

00:23:36,358 --> 00:23:38,060
Someone's trying to kill your boss,

413
00:23:38,093 --> 00:23:40,603
and we need to warn him,
so please just let us through.

414

No.

00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,263
Lets the knob down, but if you
stick your arm up there,

437
00:26:28,296 --> 00:26:30,432

00:26:54,053 --> 00:26:55,395
Hey.

443
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,462
It's you. Julia.

444
00:27:01,496 --> 00:27:04,399
Aengus has been very interested in you.

445
00:27:04,432 --> 00:27:05,834

446
00:27:05,866 --> 00:27:07,568
Oh, no, nothing to worry.

447
00:27:07,602 --> 00:27:10,163
We've all been interested
in the girl who became

448
00:27:10,226 --> 00:27:12,440
the goddess who became...

449
00:27:12,472 --> 00:27:15,810
Shit. We still need a key.

450
00:27:15,844 --> 00:27:17,445
Well, then maybe Aengus would appreciate

451
00:27:17,478 --> 00:27:20,582
- if you let us through.
- Oh, I can't.

452
00:27:25,925 --> 00:27:29,368
I quit. I can't do this anymore.

453
00:27:29,809 --> 00:27:31,545
That goddamn lullaby.

454
00:27:34,161 --> 00:27:36,096
He'd sing it every night to me.

455
00:27:37,532 --> 00:27:39,534
Even away on business...

456
00:27:39,566 --> 00:27:42,336
he'd sing it over the phone.

457
00:27:43,638 --> 00:27:46,307
He called me his little princess.

458
00:27:47,808 --> 00:27:49,810
He was better than other dads.

459
00:27:51,411 --> 00:27:54,048
And he thought I was better
than other daughters.

460
00:27:56,284 --> 00:27:57,485
Until...

461
00:27:57,517 --> 00:28:00,561
You had the audacity to grow up.

462
00:28:01,354 --> 00:28:04,656
Fucking apologies for the surprise, Dad.

463
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:07,452
He saw what he raised...

464
00:28:07,495 --> 00:28:09,419
a woman he couldn't control...

465
00:28:09,457 --> 00:28:12,261
who didn't need anyone else's approval.

466
00:28:12,286 --> 00:28:15,490
Nothing deadlier
to the fragile male ego.

467
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:23,131
He was the one who told me
I could be anything.

468
00:28:23,165 --> 00:28:26,068
And I believed him.

469
00:28:26,093 --> 00:28:29,575
But he didn't tell you that
the world makes you choose.

470
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,803
You can be one of the smart ones

471
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:35,800
or one of the pretty ones
or even a strong one.

472
00:28:35,825 --> 00:28:38,278
- But...
- Try to be all three...

473
00:28:40,122 --> 00:28:43,294
you better learn to smile and shut up...

474
00:28:43,384 --> 00:28:45,416
'cause the second you're you,

475
00:28:45,521 --> 00:28:47,455
the second...

476
00:28:47,523 --> 00:28:50,432
I'm loud, pissed off,

477
00:28:50,814 --> 00:28:52,594
it's, "What a bitch."

478
00:28:52,955 --> 00:28:54,597
"What a slut."

479
00:28:55,041 --> 00:28:58,034
"Who the fuck does she think she is?"

480
00:28:59,534 --> 00:29:02,103
So you never give them a chance.

481
00:29:02,137 --> 00:29:04,340
You hit first.

482
00:29:04,372 --> 00:29:07,442
And anyone dumb enough to hit
back soon finds that there's

483
00:29:07,476 --> 00:29:11,684
no hurting you,
sheathed in all that hard,

484
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:13,416
glossy armor.

485
00:29:13,448 --> 00:29:16,418
Then why does it hurt so much?

486
00:29:18,586 --> 00:29:22,424
Why does it feel like
I'm losing my mind, Eliot?

487
00:29:24,426 --> 00:29:27,129
Wind and sand

488
00:29:27,161 --> 00:29:29,631
reduce mountains into rubble.

489
00:29:29,665 --> 00:29:32,635
Are you stronger than a mountain?

490
00:29:35,169 --> 00:29:37,572
I'm a king.

491
00:29:37,605 --> 00:29:40,811
Not a goddamn princess.

492
00:29:41,409 --> 00:29:42,858
A king.

493
00:29:44,313 --> 00:29:46,123
You were.

494
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,252
I'm still a king.

495
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,900
King of manipulation...

496
00:29:56,492 --> 00:29:58,501
king of pointless rage...

497
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,700
king of I can't do this...

498
00:30:02,264 --> 00:30:04,513
king of he was right...

499
00:30:07,569 --> 00:30:10,086
King of I eventually fuck up everything.

500
00:30:10,178 --> 00:30:13,215
- That's not true.
- That's what Eliot would say.

501
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,612
But you're not Eliot, are you?

502
00:30:17,345 --> 00:30:18,580
You're me.

503
00:30:20,381 --> 00:30:22,650
And we know.

504
00:30:22,869 --> 00:30:26,533
Margo. Don't...

505
00:30:26,924 --> 00:30:29,493
Get angry?

506
00:30:30,324 --> 00:30:32,203
I'm angry...

507
00:30:32,494 --> 00:30:34,493
every second.

508
00:30:35,813 --> 00:30:40,504
Every second my eyes are open
because I know who I am...

509
00:30:40,753 --> 00:30:42,734
not what I pretend to be.

510
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,309
Can't do anything except pose and judge.

511
00:30:47,341 --> 00:30:48,677
Margo...

512
00:30:48,709 --> 00:30:50,418
you have to stop.

513
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,485
The only thing I ever did
right was be your best friend.

514
00:30:56,517 --> 00:31:00,421
That's the only thing I ever got right.

515
00:31:00,455 --> 00:31:02,245
And I can't even do that,

516
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:07,092
or else this fucking bag
would be fucking full!

517
00:31:46,601 --> 00:31:48,236
Wait.

518
00:31:50,472 --> 00:31:52,408
You're a girl?

519
00:31:54,508 --> 00:31:58,680
Sorry, woman. Female.

520
00:31:58,714 --> 00:32:01,317
And how am I hearing you?

521
00:32:03,685 --> 00:32:05,454
You're in my thoughts.

522
00:32:05,486 --> 00:32:07,590
Who isn't?

523
00:32:07,622 --> 00:32:09,500
- Are you getting this?
- Yeah, of course.

524
00:32:09,562 --> 00:32:10,719
Of course.

525
00:32:12,393 --> 00:32:16,364
So then maybe you can tell me
if you're a womanish thing,

526
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:20,236
why do you do such shitty
things to other women?

00:32:26,274 --> 00:32:28,182
Fuck.

529
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,883
- Last one.
- It doesn't work.

530
00:32:32,943 --> 00:32:34,674
God damn it.

531
00:32:36,471 --> 00:32:39,241
Come on.

00:32:43,496 --> 00:32:45,993

00:32:55,745 --> 00:32:57,517
- What the hell, dude?
- We were trying to warn you.

538
00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:00,186
Oh, yeah, yeah. I got you good.

539
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:03,715
Your anxieties are glowing...

540
00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:05,183
this one especially.

541
00:33:05,217 --> 00:33:07,194
The Monster is coming for you.

542
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:09,555
The... the one that you
locked up in Blackspire.

543
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:10,923
You care for a snack?

544
00:33:10,993 --> 00:33:13,429
Something to drink?
Oh, you certainly earned it.

545
00:33:13,481 --> 00:33:16,339
No, no. We... we want you to leave.

546
00:33:16,364 --> 00:33:18,202
I have a place to hide.

547
00:33:18,235 --> 00:33:22,873
I just refuse to let
your panic infect me.

548
00:33:22,953 --> 00:33:24,688
Happiness is a choice, you know.

549
00:33:24,747 --> 00:33:26,577
Yeah, well, you should
turn the panic up.

550
00:33:26,610 --> 00:33:28,579
We wasted so much time
in your escape-room shit,

551
00:33:28,613 --> 00:33:30,582
the Monster could be here any second.

552
00:33:34,618 --> 00:33:37,768
You mortals are always
so precious about time.

553
00:33:37,793 --> 00:33:40,511
"There's never enough of it.

554
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:43,173
Oh, every second, I'm closer to death."

555
00:33:43,198 --> 00:33:44,462
Ah.

556
00:33:44,502 --> 00:33:46,304
Well, yes, but...

557
00:33:46,364 --> 00:33:48,034
how can you enjoy life

558
00:33:48,066 --> 00:33:50,303
if you're in constant fear of its end?

559
00:33:50,335 --> 00:33:51,770
Think on it.

560
00:33:51,804 --> 00:33:53,672
Except you, of course.

561
00:33:53,706 --> 00:33:56,042
Julia...

562
00:33:56,074 --> 00:33:58,644
it's a fascinating pleasure.

563
00:33:58,678 --> 00:34:00,680
We're trying to save you.

564
00:34:00,712 --> 00:34:01,980
You need to hide now.

565
00:34:02,014 --> 00:34:04,097
Oh.

566
00:34:04,768 --> 00:34:07,838
Yes, it took me a while
to shake the mortal fear, too.

567
00:34:09,321 --> 00:34:10,689
You'll get there.

568
00:34:12,725 --> 00:34:14,627
So that's a no on the snacks?

569
00:34:16,361 --> 00:34:19,859
I did hope that the decoy and
alias would keep him at bay,

570
00:34:19,884 --> 00:34:21,290
but just in case...

571
00:34:23,602 --> 00:34:25,019
Fallout shelter of sorts.

572
00:34:25,066 --> 00:34:27,988
No one, not even the Monster,
can get in.

573
00:34:28,019 --> 00:34:32,738
It's gonna be so very boring, but, uh...

574
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:34,846
since you insist.

575
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:37,949
- Thank God.
- You're most welcome.

576
00:34:37,982 --> 00:34:41,987
- But before I, um...
- Jesus Christ.

577
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:45,133
Julia, come with me.

578
00:34:45,211 --> 00:34:46,699
What?

579
00:34:46,724 --> 00:34:49,627
I know a thing or two about god powers.

580
00:34:49,661 --> 00:34:52,665
I'm sure I can fix
whatever's wrong with you.

581
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:57,404
We're more alike than you know.

582
00:35:00,535 --> 00:35:02,138
Think it over.

583
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:07,854
Whilst I remember my password.

584
00:35:18,089 --> 00:35:20,727
So can we do this thing or what?

585
00:35:20,759 --> 00:35:22,995
- I don't mean to be brusque.
- Do what?

586
00:35:23,035 --> 00:35:25,257
Turn my black sand into axes.

587
00:35:26,866 --> 00:35:28,281
Uh-oh.

588
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,170
Guys, whatever the joke is, skip it.

589
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:33,899
- It's just so...
- Richly enjoyable.

590
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:35,132
Not to mention a first.

591
00:35:35,165 --> 00:35:38,102
You should feel good at least.

592
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:41,806
No other woman has ever gone
alone out there and come back

593
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,174
with all of that.

594
00:35:43,206 --> 00:35:46,076
- Most give up.
- Or die.

595
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,947
Yeah, hilarious.

596
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,550
I can't believe your kingdom exiled you.

597
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:54,119
You're strong, smart...

598
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,223
And a very adequate whore.

599
00:35:58,255 --> 00:36:00,558
Oh, yeah, it's a big uh-oh.

600
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:04,563
You know, a funny thing
happened out there.

601
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:07,065
I met one of them... a demon spirit.

602
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:11,936
And I got the whole download
on how this place really rolls.

603
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:13,938
See, I lost my shit...

604
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:16,206
<i>in a big way.</i>

605
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:17,942
And she came up out of the sand.

606
00:36:17,976 --> 00:36:21,046
Only, I didn't see shifty, scary smoke.

607
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:23,180
<i>I saw her.</i>

608
00:36:25,949 --> 00:36:28,233
Maybe it's this weirdo fairy eye I have.

609
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:30,288
It's a long and very bizarre story

610
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,357
for another day and another quest.

611
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:37,362
<i>But I also heard her.</i>

612
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:40,031
<i>She didn't attack me.</i>

613
00:36:40,063 --> 00:36:42,099
<i>That's not what they do.</i>

614
00:36:42,132 --> 00:36:44,134
But you guys already know that,
don't know?

615
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:45,971
You and your whole ruling council

616
00:36:46,003 --> 00:36:48,239
of pussy-phobic chuckle dicks.

617
00:36:48,271 --> 00:36:50,909
'Cause those spirits,
when they hear a woman

618
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:53,748
who's sad or scared or upset...

619
00:36:54,708 --> 00:36:56,732
or angry...

620
00:36:57,382 --> 00:37:00,091
they rise up out of the sand to help.

621
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:04,122
And they help by possessing whatever man

622
00:37:04,154 --> 00:37:06,123
is causing the distress.

623
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,894
They're protectors.

624
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:14,925
<i>And if the problem isn't a man...</i>

625
00:37:16,366 --> 00:37:20,137
<i>they do whatever it takes to help women.</i>

626
00:37:34,864 --> 00:37:38,234
If your intent is to tell
our people those lies...

627
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:40,481
then I'm sorry.

628
00:37:40,924 --> 00:37:43,020
But that's not gonna happen.

629
00:37:43,927 --> 00:37:46,163
If your intent was to double-cross me,

630
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:49,367
you missed a key plot point, shit-crisp.

631
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,755

No.

669
00:39:48,573 --> 00:39:51,176
Tell the spirits to exit your husband.

670
00:39:51,209 --> 00:39:54,213
They serve you... all of you.

671
00:39:54,247 --> 00:39:55,415
Come on, ladies.

672
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,925
It's time to get your head
out of the sand... literally.

673
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:00,219
Close your eyes.

674
00:40:00,252 --> 00:40:03,476
Think the thought. "Leave my husband."

675
00:40:16,968 --> 00:40:20,173
She's... talking to me.

676
00:40:22,508 --> 00:40:25,211
From now on if a demon
possesses a man or a woman,

677
00:40:25,235 --> 00:40:26,825
you can just tell them to leave.

678
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:29,023
Or stay and finish them off.

679
00:40:29,048 --> 00:40:30,614
Or help with the laundry.

680
00:40:30,683 --> 00:40:33,169
They're pretty handy.

681
00:40:41,361 --> 00:40:43,215
Hey.

682
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,935
This isn't over.

683
00:40:49,006 --> 00:40:50,375
Yes, it is.

684
00:40:50,457 --> 00:40:51,925
No, it's not.

685
00:40:51,959 --> 00:40:55,430
I'm gonna figure out whatever
the hell this, uh,

686
00:40:55,625 --> 00:40:58,995
binder's all about
and become a goddess again.

687
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,590
Okay, that's not gonna
make a difference.

688
00:41:01,615 --> 00:41:03,617
Well, yeah, there's a ton
of reasons it won't,

689
00:41:03,642 --> 00:41:05,440
but when has that stopped us?

690
00:41:05,473 --> 00:41:09,667
Look, once I finally get this
goddess shit straight...

691
00:41:09,743 --> 00:41:11,312
I need you...

692
00:41:13,147 --> 00:41:15,783

about other people...

694
00:41:17,951 --> 00:41:20,787
to want to risk your life to save them.

695
00:41:28,129 --> 00:41:29,430
I got it.

696
00:41:35,935 --> 00:41:37,705
May I come in?

697
00:41:43,778 --> 00:41:45,046
Look who's up.

698
00:41:45,078 --> 00:41:47,180
