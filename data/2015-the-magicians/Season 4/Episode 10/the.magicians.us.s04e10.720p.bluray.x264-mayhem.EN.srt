1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,441
<i>Previously on</i>
The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,586 --> 00:00:03,997
My mother was
a hedge witch, too.

3
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:05,669
I didn't know
you were a hedge.

4
00:00:05,756 --> 00:00:08,715
Oh, yes. My mentor,
Everett, found me.

5
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:22,971
The Foremost saved them
with special weapons

6
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:24,226
that expel possession.

7
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:27,354
They call them ice axes,
and I'm assuming that's poetic license.

8
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,151
So, we might have
a chance to save Eliot.

9
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:32,063
Overthrow me right
the fuck now, Fen.

10
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:34,524
- I never should have...
- Or I will never forgive you.

11
00:00:34,618 --> 00:00:35,779
And neither will Eliot,

12
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,657
if you keep me from getting
the one thing that can save him.

13
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,957
When the going gets tough,

14
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,751
tough listens
to pop anthems from the '80s.

15
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,171
Hi. It's me. It's the real me.
It's Eliot.

16
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:52,001
This is a mind palace situation
and we don't have a lot of time,

17
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:54,014
and I have some extremely
major shit to tell you.

18
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:55,962
<i>Some god of war.</i>

19
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,049
He only liked them
when they were too weak to fight.

20
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,633
He's not trying
to rebuild his body.

21
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:01,927
That's not what
the stones are.

22
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,562
That's not what they're for.

23
00:01:04,648 --> 00:01:05,980
It's so much worse than that.

24
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,520
- Just breathe.
- If the stones aren't for building a body,

25
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:12,693
what does
he want with them?

26
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,733
No, he's building a body.
His sister's.

27
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:18,363
He's trying to bring her
back to life.

28
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,570
Oh, my God.

29
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:24,954
That's the girl he thought was a sacrifice
to summon Enyalius, but she wasn't.

30
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,563
Enyalius and the other gods
killed her.

31
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:29,250
They chopped her up and turned
her into four stone organs.

32
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:32,332
- Jesus. There's two of them.
- Yeah.

33
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,463
And if he got prison
and she got the death penalty,

34
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:36,044
I'm guessing
she's the bad one.

35
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,430
Till he remembers,

36
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,756
he won't know
to go look for Enyalius.

37
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:43,811
Hi.

38
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:48,522
If you want to talk to me,
the price is a drink.

39
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:50,437
You're fun.

40
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,028
One drink.

41
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,236
- What are you having, ma'am?
- Vodka ice.

42
00:01:58,327 --> 00:01:59,568
Vodka ice.

43
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,413
There you go.

44
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,294
- I have a question.
- No, I don't come here often.

45
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,995
You haven't
seen me anywhere.

46
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:13,797
And, yes, I do
have plans this weekend.

47
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:14,925
Still have a question?

48
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:16,969
Yes.

49
00:02:19,014 --> 00:02:21,757
Why does this place
smell like death?

50
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,973
It is weird, right?

51
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:32,605
Bar next to a hospital.

52
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:36,104
Doctors need happy hour,
too, I guess.

53
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:39,532
So that's what you are?
A doctor?

54
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,324
No.

55
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,246
I'm sick.

56
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,372
But I got good news today.

57
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,372
I'll only be sick
for another two months.

58
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,088
Three, maybe.

59
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:59,715
Sometimes my friend says
one thing but means another thing.

60
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,797
Is that what you're doing?

61
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:07,302
- Keep 'em coming.
- Keep 'em coming.

62
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,732
<i>Meet me in a restaurant</i>

63
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,524
<i>Meet me on the top
of the world</i>

64
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:25,324
<i>Meet me
And we'll talk the language of love</i>

65
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,497
<i>I'll meet you
anywhere you want</i>

66
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,296
<i>I'll meet you
on a ballroom floor</i>

67
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,749
Well, I'm definitely hitting
my step goals today, huh?

68
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:41,587
<i>Meet me and we'll float to
the level above</i>

69
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,126
<i>I wish you'd drop
what you're doing</i>

70
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,143
Jesus, fuck,
a wise man's donkey.

71
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,237
Just give me a sign.

72
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,573
Come on. Where's water?

73
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:11,667
Anything.

74
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,866
Wait.

75
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:57,920
<i>Don't get me wrong</i>

76
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:03,001
<i>If I'm looking kind of dazzled</i>

77
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,380
El?

78
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:08,636
<i>I see neon lights</i>

79
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:12,101
<i>Whenever you walk by</i>

80
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:13,187
Eliot?

81
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,059
<i>Don't get me wrong</i>

82
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,685
Oh, my God.

83
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:21,360
<i>If you say hello
and I take a ride</i>

84
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:26,073
<i>Upon a sea
where the mystic moon</i>

85
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,736
<i>Is playing havoc
with the tide</i>

86
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,492
Hey! It's you, right?

87
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,038
<i>Don't get me wrong</i>

88
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,832
It can't be The Monster.
He doesn't have the moves.

89
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,747
Hey, what are you
doing here?

90
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,627
Turn down the music
and talk to me, will you?

91
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,176
Wait a sec.

92
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,210
Whoa.

93
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,838
Oh, my God.
I'm tripping on lizard.

94
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,802
<i>Don't get me wrong</i>

95
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:58,682
<i>If I'm acting so distracted</i>

96
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:03,361
<i>I'm thinking
about the fireworks</i>

97
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:05,191
Oh, come on.

98
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:08,650
<i>That go off when you smile</i>

99
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:12,825
<i>Don't get me wrong</i>

100
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:17,575
<i>If I split
like light refracted</i>

101
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,629
<i>I'm only off to wander</i>

102
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:27,798
<i>Across a moonlit mile</i>

103
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:34,722
<i>Once in a while,
two people meet</i>

104
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:39,727
<i>Seemingly for no reason
Theyjust pass on the street</i>

105
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:44,026
<i>Suddenly thundershowers
everywhere</i>

106
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,862
<i>Who can explain
the thunder and rain?</i>

107
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,782
Don't get me wrong.
I'm happy to see you.

108
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:52,656
Where are you taking me, Eliot?
I'm so thirsty.

109
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,363
<i>Don't get me wrong</i>

110
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,497
<i>If I come
and go like fashion</i>

111
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:04,664
<i>I might be great tomorrow</i>

112
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:10,886
<i>But hopeless yesterday</i>

113
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:15,933
<i>Don't get me wrong</i>

114
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:18,932
<i>If I fall
in the mode of passion</i>

115
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:23,645
<i>It might be unbelievable</i>

116
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:28,821
<i>But let's not say so long</i>

117
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,990
<i>It might be just fantastic</i>

118
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,071
<i>Don't get me wrong</i>

119
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,500
Woman, hello.

120
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:53,806
Oh, hey.

121
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:55,975
Hi.

122
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,847
Can't believe that psychotropic
douche got me here.

123
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,936
Can I get some water?

124
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,445
Who wants
the honor of killing her?

125
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:11,523
Hey, if water's a dealio,
I'm good.

126
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,323
Oh, we have water.

127
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,742
What we don't have
are strangers

128
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,348
- wandering into our camp.
- Her wrist.

129
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,703
Our enemy's enemy
is our ally.

130
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,083
Well, how about that?

131
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,220
You're in pain,
aren't you?

132
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,358
Come with me.

133
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,063
I can take it away.

134
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,645
Sorry,
but I got to get home

135
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:54,153
and tell my parents
all the medical debt was for nothing.

136
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,830
Thanks for the drinks.

137
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,790
Wait.

138
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:04,626
Do that again.

139
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:07,629
My face.

140
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,456
Touch my face.

141
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:14,011
Are you okay?

142
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,974
Whenever you touch my face,
I remember something.

143
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,521
Again.

144
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:31,481
You remind me of someone
I had forgotten...

145
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,531
My sister.

146
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,325
I'm gonna leave.

147
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,617
No, you have to
come with me now.

148
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:39,944
No, I'm...

149
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,506
What's up?

150
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:53,215
This was
in the Mirror World.

151
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,918
And I heard you were looking
for the binder, so...

152
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,505
Holy shit.

153
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,841
It's in some language
I've never seen before. I...

154
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:06,020
Well, I'll get on this just as soon
as we find Enyalius.

155
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,893
Hopefully before
The Monster does.

156
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,815
I thought we wanted him
to find Enyalius.

157
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:13,019
Yeah, we did,
but we were wrong.

158
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,604
He's building his sister.

159
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:17,614
What are y'all doing?

160
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:21,198
Tracking the Library's entire
magic infrastructure

161
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,779
to find weak points
and start a rebellion.

162
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,292
But, um, good luck
with yours.

163
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,711
Yeah. Thanks. You, too.

164
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,584
Yeah, I can tell you
what he looks like,

165
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,669
the food the dude
likes to eat,

166
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,671
but shit-all
for anything useful.

167
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:38,548
One thing is bugging me.

168
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,845
In the memory,

169
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:42,139
I could swear he was
wearing a ring, emerald.

170
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:46,136
Guy is described up and down,
but nothing about the ring.

171
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,414
Wait a minute.
Did you say emerald?

172
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,438
Yeah.

173
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,482
When I did research
with the Free Traders,

174
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:54,356
there was this god.
What was his name? Uh...

175
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,237
He... He always
worked in disguise,

176
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:01,237
but he was known for always
wearing an emerald ring.

177
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,819
So Enyalius is a front.

178
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,074
Here.

179
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,281
Aengus.

180
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:08,828
Celtic god.

181
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:14,126
- Jules, it says here he's a trickster.
- It's fine.

182
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,424
And we...
It wouldn't be a summoning.

183
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,968
We can only get to him
through a magical creature.

184
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,795
Apparently there's
a whole species

185
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,758
that exists to entertain him
and protect him.

186
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,889
And they're
really annoying and...

187
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:31,393
What I'm getting at is,
we need to find a leprechaun.

188
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,244
- Don't!
- I'm sorry.

189
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:56,422
Listen, I... I just saw
this red sand out there.

190
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,588
It was following me.

191
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,792
I thought it was
'cause I was tripping balls.

192
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:01,843
Our desert is alive.

193
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,052
It's filled with demon spirits
that attack our women.

194
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,262
Okay.

195
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:11,346
Speaking of D-spirits,
I'm looking for something

196
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,768
- I think you guys have.
- You know what can happen.

197
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,085
- A pair of black...
- You're angry with me?

198
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,771
How dare you?

199
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,173
You lay with my sister,
and I'm the one you scream at?

200
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:20,688
I'm the one you threaten?

201
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,274
- Zal, calm yourself.
- Pig!

202
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:25,179
You want my sister?
She's yours.

203
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,284
Wow.

204
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:27,987
Desert Dynasty.

205
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,788
Think we're gonna
get a girl fight?

206
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,116
Jesus, how long
does one lick last?

207
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,497
Take her. You two
deserve each other.

208
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,330
You must be silent! Now.

209
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:51,895
Gross.

210
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:55,477
But cool, but gross.

211
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:21,086
So, anytime a woman gets
a teensy bit emotional,

212
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:24,043
one of those things rises up
out of the sand, and what?

213
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,212
Possesses her.

214
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,847
Eventually causing paralysis,
even death.

215
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,142
Men save us because they alone
have the strength to survive.

216
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,311
And the spirit zoo
you got going?

217
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:35,729
They can't be killed,

218
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,681
so I've learned
how to imprison them.

219
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,226
Some brave dudes.

220
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:43,103
And some awfully
compliant women.

221
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,954
You're not seeing or hearing this,
are you?

222
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,782
Seeing or hearing...

223
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,085
I thought so.

224
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,413
Man, this lizard's got
a half-life like uranium.

225
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,999
So the guy with the axes,
which tent's he hang his thong in?

226
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,386
Have we identified the leader
of the Serpent group yet?

227
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,301
Not yet, but we're looking.

228
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,684
Where?

229
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,102
Phyllis is in charge
of that investigation.

230
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,896
I could join her.

231
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,835
Perhaps there are places
she doesn't know to look

232
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,567
that I would,
considering my past.

233
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,565
That's a very generous offer.

234
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:29,529
But it seems that you have
enough on your plate already.

235
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,155
Hmm.

236
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,281
Very well.

237
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,829
I was just
sitting in a bar

238
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:36,373
when a bear named Humbledrum
started talking to me.

239
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,543
What can I tell you?
Fillory's a weird place.

240
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:40,962
So I hear.

241
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,955
- But you...
- Mmm-hmm.

242
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,881
- A woman...
- Mmm-hmm.

243
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,209
- As king?
- Talking animals.

244
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,183
I'm gonna go
get some more.

245
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:14,746
Wow.

246
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,538
Light speed, Bambi.

247
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,287
Okay, can you just tell me?

248
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:20,959
What the hell are you?

249
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,581
Pieces of you.

250
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:24,295
Your spirit guide.

251
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:27,170
Your memories.
Your Eliot.

252
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,088
Your conscience.

253
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:32,888
- Speaking of conscience...
- Wait, what?

254
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,556
You're really gonna
pass lycanthropy

255
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,679
to a guy who lives
on a planet with two moons?

256
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,122
I'll tell them I'm surfing
the red breakers,

257
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:39,226
and we got to get creative.

258
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,104
And this is just
to get the axes.

259
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,770
Out, now.

260
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,280
And this is
guiding me how?

261
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:56,078
It's the song you think to yourself
whenever you're working a guy, remember?

262
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,656
High school,
junior year?

263
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,792
- Ray Latanza.
- Ray Latanza.

264
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,039
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

265
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,870
This song came out
on the car radio.

266
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,707
I wanted to ride in his Porsche,
so I gave him a hand job.

267
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,917
In your own driveway,
which is sad,

268
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:11,252
'cause then your dad
walked out.

269
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,428
Okay, road closure
on Memory Lane.

270
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:18,051
<i>I don't know
where I'm going</i>

271
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:23,222
<i>But I sure know
where I've been</i>

272
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:29,228
<i>Hanging on the promises
in the songs of yesterday</i>

273
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:33,069
<i>'Cause I've made up my mind</i>

274
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:37,577
<i>I ain't wasting no more time</i>

275
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,326
<i>Here I go again</i>

276
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,122
<i>Here I go again</i>

277
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:46,795
Hey, Margo.
Thanks for inviting me.

278
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,088
I invited her?

279
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,173
<i>Though I keep searching
for an answer</i>

280
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:59,304
<i>I never seem to find
what I'm looking for</i>

281
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:04,513
<i>O Lord, I pray
You give me the strength to carry on</i>

282
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:09,272
<i>'Cause I know what it means</i>

283
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:13,026
<i>To walk along the lonely
street of dreams</i>

284
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:19,153
<i>Here I go again on my own</i>

285
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:23,662
<i>Going down the only road
I've ever known</i>

286
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:28,458
<i>Like a drifter,
I was born to walk alone</i>

287
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:34,635
<i>And I made up my mind</i>

288
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,639
<i>I ain't wasting no more time</i>

289
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:46,263
The Library says that they have
sufficient levels of ambient magic.

290
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,937
Magic output reports
are published weekly.

291
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,735
Yeah, well, we didn't trust
them, and guess what.

292
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,355
Look.

293
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:58,533
This is how much magic the Library says is
being distributed as ambient.

294
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,537
And this is the level
in the pipes right now.

295
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:07,076
It's nothing close to the amount
of magic they say there is.

296
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:12,169
So long as Library members
get their Deweys, who cares?

297
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,300
Beside hedges.

298
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,672
- That can't be right.
- It is.

299
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,008
We bugged the pipes.

300
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,511
A beetle
with McCormick's tracer.

301
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,302
Were you mapping
the pipe system?

302
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,262
Trying to.

303
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,895
Until our beetle disintegrated
somewhere outside Earth.

304
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,977
But the spell
shows magic levels.

305
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,110
And when we saw this,
we thought we should show you,

306
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:36,522
because I don't think
you signed up

307
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:39,859
to work for an organization
that lies, right?

308
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,365
- I'm sure there's an explanation.
- There is.

309
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,539
Harriet told you and me.

310
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,208
Everett's trying
to squeeze out hedges.

311
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,035
This is just
more of the same.

312
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,371
Look, you are on the inside.

313
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,216
You can find out where
the extra magic is going

314
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:59,636
and why they're hoarding it
and why the Library is lying.

315
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,221
Mmm.

316
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,217
Yeah, sweetie.
Just let me borrow them.

317
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:08,224
I'll have them back in a day,
two at the most.

318
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,774
- No one else can use them but me.
- Mmm!

319
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,438
They're enchanted.

320
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:17,737
As I'm sure you can understand
better than most.

321
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,740
I, uh...

322
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,652
I loved it last night
when you did that thing to me.

323
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:29,207
What are you,
some kind of witch?

324
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:30,794
Magician.

325
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,624
So can I get ones
that work for me?

326
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,505
You'll have to make your own.

327
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,082
Swell. How?

328
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,260
Mostly white, no?

329
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,099
But every hundredth
grain or so...

330
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,276
Is black.

331
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:56,903
Mmm.

332
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,275
A warrior goes
alone into the desert,

333
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:01,940
picks out only the black ones,

334
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,492
enough to fill a large bag,

335
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:06,779
which is then forged.

336
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:08,581
Thanks.

337
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:12,125
- You're gonna try?
- I'm gonna do.

338
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:16,422
If you get the least bit emotional,
the spirits will possess you.

339
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,123
Clear on that.

340
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,174
And there'll be
no man to protect you.

341
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:23,220
- Story of my life.
- And you can't use magic.

342
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,888
- It renders the grains...
- Impotent?

343
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:29,976
- I don't know that word.
- You sure don't, Marathon Man.

344
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,226
<i>I'm just another heart
in need of rescue</i>

345
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:42,318
<i>Waiting on
love's sweet charity</i>

346
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:48,738
<i>And I'm gonna hold on
for the rest of my days</i>

347
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:51,490
What is she doing here?

348
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,701
- Four-octave range, bitch.
- Seriously?

349
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,831
I got my id,
my lost innocence,

350
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:59,210
my guilt,
and now my inadequacy?

351
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:03,673
<i>'Cause I know
what it means</i>

352
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:08,007
<i>To walk along the lonely
street of dreams</i>

353
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:13,183
<i>And here I go again
on my own</i>

354
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:18,104
<i>Going down the only road
I've ever known</i>

355
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:23,193
<i>Like a drifter, I was born
to walk alone</i>

356
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:28,444
<i>And I've made up my mind</i>

357
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:33,206
<i>I ain't wasting no more time</i>

358
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,249
<i>But here I go again</i>

359
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:36,872
Okay, this is too much.

360
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,954
Your subconscious thought
you needed some wisdom.

361
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:42,507
You do whiskey,
not wisdom.

362
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:44,676
Okay. Fine.

363
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:48,798
<i>And I
made up my mind</i>

364
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:53,636
<i>I ain't wasting
no more time</i>

365
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,186
Show-off.

366
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:58,936
<i>Here I go again</i>

367
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:04,233
<i>Here I go again</i>

368
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:09,617
<i>Here I go again</i>

369
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:16,412
<i>Here I go!</i>

370
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,110
Ah, morning.
What can I do you for?

371
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:27,002
Uh, we were hoping that you could
help us find somebody.

372
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:30,260
Well, I'm not sure about that,
but, uh, I can fix your shoes.

373
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:35,102
- Uh, this is Berry's, right?
- Yeah.

374
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,053
I'm Berry, so...

375
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,433
We're looking
for a leprechaun.

376
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:46,943
Right. So are you looking for, like,
a pot-of-gold leprechaun,

377
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,820
or is this a breakfast-cereal
situation, or...

378
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,304
We're looking
for a god named Aengus,

379
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,014
but to find him we have to talk
to a leprechaun first,

380
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,496
and I know this is
a bat-shit thing to say

381
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,825
with a straight face,
but if you could help us...

382
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,038
Well, all right,
since you're desperate.

383
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:04,964
Are you the leprechaun?

384
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,963
What do you expect some short
little bearded child in overalls

385
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,385
with a buckle on me hat?

386
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:10,949
Why didn't you just tell us?

387
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:12,853
Because you're hysterical
when you're desperate.

388
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,003
Want to see Aengus?

389
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:24,438
He's right through there.

390
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,317
Great. No knob.

391
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:34,355
Someone's trying
to kill your boss,

392
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,871
and we need to warn him,
so, please, just let us through.

393
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,493
No.

394
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,622
Aengus is pretty strict on that.
Keeps out the riffraff.

395
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:43,332
Don't worry.

396
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,789
Everything you need to open
the door is in here.

397
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:46,999
It's fun.

398
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:50,631
It's an escape room,
like for kids' parties.

399
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:52,972
Not ours.

400
00:24:56,704 --> 00:25:02,746
<i>Beautiful dreamer</i>

401
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:07,629
<i>Wake unto me</i>

402
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:13,468
<i>Starlight and dew drops</i>

403
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:17,594
<i>Are waiting for thee</i>

404
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:19,142
Enough.

405
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,470
You loved this song when you were little
and your father sang it.

406
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:25,226
You're me, right?

407
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:27,477
I run me, so shut it.

408
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:14,489
Yes.

409
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:21,438
- It's okay. I think I can get it.
- Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.

410
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:23,873
Lets the knob down,

411
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,852
but if you stick your arm up there,
you'll just get sliced up.

412
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,647
We have no idea how close The Monster is.
So, if I get cut, I get cut.

413
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,191
We don't have time
to argue about this.

414
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,873
Stupid, 'cause one of us here
is indestructible.

415
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:57,318
It's you. Julia.

416
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:00,738
Aengus has been
very interested in you.

417
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:01,948
What's that
supposed to mean?

418
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,869
No, no, nothing to worry.

419
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:08,701
We've all been interested in the girl
who became the goddess who became...

420
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:11,252
Shit. We still need a key.

421
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,485
Well, then maybe Aengus
would appreciate if you let us through.

422
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:15,749
Aw...

423
00:27:15,843 --> 00:27:16,843
I can't.

424
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,810
I quit.
I can't do this anymore.

425
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,602
That goddamn lullaby.

426
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,727
He'd sing it
every night to me.

427
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,273
Even away on business,

428
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:39,029
he'd sing it over the phone.

429
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:42,992
He called me
his little princess.

430
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,870
He was better
than other dads.

431
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,659
And he thought I was better
than other daughters.

432
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:56,919
- Until...
- You had the audacity to grow up.

433
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,256
Fuckin' apologies
for the surprise, Dad.

434
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:03,721
He saw what he raised...

435
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,223
A woman
he couldn't control.

436
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:09,014
Who didn't need
anyone else's approval.

437
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:12,347
Nothing deadlier
to the fragile male ego.

438
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,862
He was the one who told me
I could be anything.

439
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,694
And I believed him.

440
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,994
But he didn't tell you
that the world makes you choose.

441
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,659
You can be
one of the smart ones

442
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:32,709
or one of the pretty ones
or even a strong one.

443
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,377
- But...
- Try to be all three...

444
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:39,424
You better learn to smile
and shut up...

445
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,297
'Cause the second
you're you,

446
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,299
the second...

447
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,802
Out loud, pissed off,

448
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,803
it's, "What a bitch."

449
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,727
"What a slut."

450
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,434
"Who the fuck
does she think she is?"

451
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:58,814
So you never
give them a chance.

452
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:00,402
You hit first.

453
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:05,533
And anyone dumb enough to hit back soon
finds that there's no hurting you,

454
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:10,201
sheathed in all that
hard, glossy armor.

455
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:12,908
Then why does it
hurt so much?

456
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:19,255
Why does it feel like
I'm losing my mind, Eliot?

457
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,129
Wind and sand

458
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,717
reduce mountains
into rubble.

459
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,549
Are you stronger
than a mountain?

460
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:33,644
I'm a king.

461
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:37,269
Not a goddamn princess.

462
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:39,568
A king.

463
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,530
You were.

464
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:46,820
I'm still a king.

465
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,659
King of manipulation.

466
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,041
King of pointless rage.

467
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,415
King of "I can't do this."

468
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,039
King of "He was right."

469
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,094
King of "I eventually
fuck up everything."

470
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:10,218
- That's not true.
- That's what Eliot would say.

471
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,178
But you're not Eliot,
are you?

472
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:15,387
You're me.

473
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,477
And we know.

474
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:23,524
Margo. Don't...

475
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:24,989
Get angry?

476
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,529
I'm angry

477
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,531
every second.

478
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:36,992
Every second my eyes are open
because I know who I am.

479
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,577
Not what I pretend to be.

480
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,169
Can't do anything
except pose and judge.

481
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,967
Margo, you have to stop.

482
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:52,553
The only thing I ever did right
was be your best friend.

483
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:57,349
That's the only thing
I ever got right.

484
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:59,101
And I can't even do that,

485
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,183
or else this fucking bag

486
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,108
would be fucking full!

487
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,860
Wait.

488
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:48,489
You're a girl?

489
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:54,739
Sorry, woman. Female?

490
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,530
And how am I hearing you?

491
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,209
You're in my thoughts.

492
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:03,999
Who isn't?

493
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,442
- Are you getting this?
- Yeah, of course.

494
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:07,466
Of course.

495
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:12,504
So then maybe you can tell me
if you're a womanish thing,

496
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:16,716
why do you do such shitty things
to other women?

497
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:20,938
What?

498
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:24,608
- Fuck.
- Fuck.

499
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:30,271
- Last one.
- It doesn't work.

500
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:31,949
God damn it.

501
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,659
Come on.

502
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,666
You may enter.

503
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:45,244
Aengus. Or, Enyalius.

504
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,108
Whatever your name is.
Do we... We're too late.

505
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,293
Shit. Shit.

506
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,093
Oh, your face.

507
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,199
- What the hell, dude?
- We were trying to warn you.

508
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,636
Yeah, yeah,
I got you good.

509
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:01,685
Your anxieties
are glowing.

510
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,430
- This one especially.
- The Monster is coming for you.

511
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,107
The one that you
locked up in Blackspire.

512
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:10,903
You care for a snack? Something to drink?
I mean, you've certainly earned it.

513
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,732
No. No. We...
We want you to leave.

514
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,612
I have a place to hide.

515
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:19,912
I just refuse
to let your panic infect me.

516
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:22,285
Happiness is a choice,
you know.

517
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,082
Yeah, well,
you should turn the panic up.

518
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:26,081
We wasted so much time
in your escape-room shit,

519
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,083
The Monster could be here
any second.

520
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:35,511
You mortals are always
so precious about time.

521
00:33:35,597 --> 00:33:37,930
"There's never
enough of it."

522
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:41,600
"Ahh! Every second,
I'm closer to death. Ahh!"

523
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,727
Well, yes, but...

524
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:47,683
How can you enjoy life if you're
in constant fear of its end?

525
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:52,486
Think on it.
Except you, of course, Julia.

526
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,114
It's a fascinating
pleasure.

527
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,447
We're trying to save you.

528
00:33:58,537 --> 00:33:59,778
You need to hide now.

529
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:01,202
Hide?

530
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:05,291
Yes, it took me a while
to shake the mortal fear, too.

531
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,957
You'll get there.

532
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:12,089
So that's a no
on the snacks?

533
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:17,091
I did hope that the decoy
and alias would keep him at bay,

534
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,967
but just in case...

535
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:22,512
Fallout shelter of sorts.

536
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:25,640
No one, not even
The Monster, can get in.

537
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,848
It's gonna be so very boring,
but, uh...

538
00:34:30,652 --> 00:34:32,518
Since you insist.

539
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:35,480
- Thank God.
- You're most welcome.

540
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:38,699
- But before I, um...
- Jesus Christ.

541
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:42,487
Julia, come with me.

542
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,164
What?

543
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:47,083
I know a thing or two
about god powers.

544
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:50,002
I'm sure I can fix
whatever's wrong with you.

545
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:54,840
We're more alike
than you know.

546
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,096
Think it over.

547
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:05,010
Whilst I remember
my password.

548
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:18,189
So, can we do
this thing or what?

549
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:20,525
- I don't mean to be brusque.
- Do what?

550
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:22,827
Turn my black sand into axes.

551
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,497
Uh-oh.

552
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,957
Guys, whatever
the joke is, skip it.

553
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,460
- It's just so...
- Richly enjoyable.

554
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:32,753
Not to mention a first.

555
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:35,456
You should feel good
at least.

556
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:39,085
No other woman has ever gone alone
out there and come back

557
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:40,545
with all of that.

558
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,134
- Most give up.
- Or die.

559
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,640
Yeah, hilarious.

560
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,762
I can't believe
your kingdom exiled you.

561
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:51,522
You're strong, smart...

562
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,358
And a very adequate whore.

563
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,812
Oh, yeah, it's a big uh-oh.

564
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:01,844
You know, a funny thing
happened out there.

565
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,406
I met one of them,
a demon spirit.

566
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:08,205
And I got the whole download on
how this place really rolls.

567
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,246
See, I lost my shit,

568
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,293
<i>in a big way.</i>

569
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:15,254
And she came up
out of the sand.

570
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,378
Only, I didn't see
shifty, scary smoke.

571
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,543
<i>I saw her.</i>

572
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,931
Maybe it's this weirdo
fairy eye I have.

573
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,929
It's a long
and very bizarre story

574
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,762
for another day
and another quest.

575
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,765
<i>But I also heard her.</i>

576
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,355
<i>She didn't attack me.</i>

577
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:39,361
<i>That's not what they do.</i>

578
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:41,669
But you guys already
know that, don't know?

579
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:45,610
You and your whole ruling council of
pussy-phobic chuckle-dicks.

580
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:48,196
'Cause those spirits,
when they hear a woman

581
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:51,248
who's sad
or scared or upset...

582
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,076
Or angry...

583
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,588
They rise up
out of the sand to help.

584
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:03,466
And they help by possessing
whatever man is causing the distress.

585
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:07,173
They're protectors.

586
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,560
<i>And if the problem
isn't a man,</i>

587
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:17,934
<i>they do whatever it takes
to help women.</i>

588
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:35,080
If your intent is to tell
our people those lies,

589
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,206
then I'm sorry,

590
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,872
but that's not gonna happen.

591
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,880
If your intent
was to double-cross me,

592
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,257
you missed a key
plot point, shit-crisp.

593
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,848
I'm a fuckin' magician.

594
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:59,354
<i>There's a storm
on the way</i>

595
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,401
<i>All right</i>

596
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:07,701
<i>There's a storm on the way</i>

597
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:14,289
<i>And it's coming
no matter what I say</i>

598
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:17,918
<i>There's truth in the thunder</i>

599
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,419
<i>There's love in the lightning</i>

600
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:20,713
<i>The feeling is frightening</i>

601
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:22,461
<i>But isn't it exciting?</i>

602
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,337
<i>I'm something
like stormy weather</i>

603
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:27,670
<i>If I weren't, we'd never
huddle together</i>

604
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:28,880
<i>Do I have to tell you</i>

605
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,886
<i>That I'm also the sunlight
that shines shortly after?</i>

606
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,888
<i>I just rain 'cause I have to</i>

607
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,470
<i>On to another chapter,
I wish you lots of laughter</i>

608
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,476
<i>Till the next time you see me</i>

609
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:44,437
<i>Just remember you need me,
I'm the storm coming</i>

610
00:38:44,531 --> 00:38:46,022
<i>Just remember you need me</i>

611
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:49,404
<i>I'm the storm coming</i>

612
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,030
<i>So here I come,
I come, I come</i>

613
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,452
No...

614
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:56,741
<i>I'm the storm coming</i>

615
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:58,701
<i>Just remember you need me</i>

616
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:00,286
<i>I'm the storm coming</i>

617
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,791
<i>I wish you lots of laughter</i>

618
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,463
<i>Till the next time
you see me</i>

619
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,882
<i>Just remember you need me</i>

620
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:06,709
<i>I'm the storm coming</i>

621
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,589
<i>Just remember you need me</i>

622
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:14,426
<i>I'm the storm coming</i>

623
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:17,683
<i>So here I come,
I come, I come</i>

624
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,308
<i>I'm the storm coming</i>

625
00:39:19,399 --> 00:39:20,890
<i>Come on</i>

626
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:24,068
<i>Here I come, I come, I come</i>

627
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:27,442
<i>Don't ask why</i>

628
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:29,398
<i>Just live</i>

629
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:32,985
<i>And die</i>

630
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,000
Aren't you gonna
use the axes?

631
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,207
No.

632
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,796
Tell the spirits
to exit your husband.

633
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:52,009
They serve you...
All of you.

634
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:53,840
Come on, ladies.

635
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:56,641
It's time to get your head
out of the sand... Literally.

636
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,306
Close your eyes.

637
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,888
Think the thought,
"Leave my husband."

638
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:17,951
She's talking to me.

639
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:23,252
From now on, if a demon
possesses a man or a woman,

640
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:24,829
you can just
tell them to leave.

641
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:26,747
Or stay and finish them off.

642
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,666
Or help with the laundry.

643
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,459
They're pretty handy.

644
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,015
Hey.

645
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,567
This isn't over.

646
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,523
Yes, it is.

647
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:50,072
No, it's not.

648
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:54,700
I'm gonna figure out whatever
the hell this, uh, binder's all about

649
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,778
and become a goddess again.

650
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:59,530
Okay, that's not
gonna make a difference.

651
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,832
Well, yeah, there's a ton
of reasons it won't,

652
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:03,534
but when has
that stopped us?

653
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,836
Look, once I finally get this
goddess shit straight...

654
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:08,924
I need you...

655
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:13,711
To help remind me
what it's like to give a shit

656
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:14,966
about other people,

657
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:18,717
to want to risk
your life to save them.

658
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,524
I got it.

659
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:35,657
May I come in?

660
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,411
Look who's up.

661
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,333
Trump and Aunt Lydia.

662
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,710
Welcome to the
New Desert Order.

663
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:49,538
It's gonna suck for you.

664
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:59,933
<i>Beautiful dreamer</i>

665
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:04,103
<i>Queen of my song</i>

666
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:12,813
<i>List' while I woo thee</i>

667
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:19,243
<i>With soft melody</i>

668
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:26,246
<i>Gone are the cares of</i>

669
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:30,712
<i>Life's busy throng</i>

670
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,047
Nice song, asshole.

671
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:37,011
<i>Beautiful dreamer</i>

672
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:42,099
<i>Awake unto me</i>

673
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:50,525
Look, I know you're just
a reptilian hallucination.

674
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:56,772
But I miss you...

675
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:00,071
So much.

676
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,575
And I promise you...

677
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:08,079
I'm gonna get you back.

678
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:28,972
<i>Sound of the rude world</i>

679
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:33,685
<i>Heard in the day</i>

680
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:39,565
<i>Led by the moonlight</i>

681
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:43,528
<i>Have all passed away</i>

682
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:52,037
<i>Beautiful dreamer</i>

683
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:56,875
