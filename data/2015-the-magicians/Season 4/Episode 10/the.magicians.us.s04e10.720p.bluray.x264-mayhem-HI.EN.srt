He only liked them

He's not trying

That's not what
the stones are.

he want with them?

00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,733
No, he's building a body.
His sister's.

Oh, my God.

31
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:24,954
That's the girl he thought was a sacrifice
to summon Enyalius, but she wasn't.

32
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,563
Enyalius and the other gods
killed her.

33
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:29,250
They chopped her up and turned
her into four stone organs.

- Jesus. There's two of them.
- Yeah.

35
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,463
And if he got prison
and she got the death penalty,

36
00:01:34,553 --> 00:01:36,044
I'm guessing
she's the bad one.

37
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,430

38
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,756

00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,845
In the memory,

179
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:42,139
I could swear he was
wearing a ring, emerald.

180
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:46,136
Guy is described up and down,
but nothing about the ring.

181
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,414
Wait a minute.
Did you say emerald?

182
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,438
Yeah.

183
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,482
When I did research
with the Free Traders,

184
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:54,356
there was this god.
What was his name? Uh...

185
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,237
He... He always
worked in disguise,

186
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:01,237
but he was known for always
wearing an emerald ring.

187
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,819
So Enyalius is a front.

188
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,074
JULIA: Here.

189
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,281
Aengus.

190
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:08,828
Celtic god.

191
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:14,126
- Jules, it says here he's a trickster.
- It's fine.

192
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,424
And we...
It wouldn't be a summoning.

193
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,968
We can only get to him
through a magical creature.

194
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:21,795
Apparently there's
a whole species

195
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:24,758
that exists to entertain him
and protect him.

196
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,889
And they're
really annoying and...

197
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:31,393
What I'm getting at is,
we need to find a leprechaun.

198
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,562
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

199
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,244
- Don't!
- I'm sorry.

200
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:56,422
Listen, I... I just saw
this red sand out there.

201
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:57,588
It was following me.

202
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,792
I thought it was
'cause I was tripping balls.

203
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:01,843
Our desert is alive.

204
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,052
It's filled with demon spirits
that attack our women.

205
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:08,262
Okay.

206
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:11,346
Speaking of D-spirits,
I'm looking for something

207
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,768
- I think you guys have.
- MAN: You know what can happen.

208
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,085
- A pair of black...
- WOMAN: You're angry with me?

209
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,771
How dare you?

210
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:19,173
You lay with my sister,
and I'm the one you scream at?

211
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:20,688
I'm the one you threaten?

212
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,274
- Zal, calm yourself.
- Pig!

213
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:25,179
You want my sister?
She's yours.

214
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:26,284
Wow.

215
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:27,987
Desert Dynasty.

216
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,788
Think we're gonna
get a girl fight?

217
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,116
Jesus, how long
does one lick last?

218
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,497
Take her. You two
deserve each other.

219
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,330
- You must be silent! Now.

So, anytime a woman gets
a teensy bit emotional,

228
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:24,043
one of those things rises up
out of the sand, and what?

229
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,212
Possesses her.

230
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,847
Eventually causing paralysis,
even death.

231
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:32,142
Men save us because they alone
have the strength to survive.

232
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,311
And the spirit zoo
you got going?

233
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:35,729
They can't be killed,

234
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,681
so I've learned
how to imprison them.

235
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,226
Some brave dudes.

236
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:43,103
And some awfully
compliant women.

237
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,954
You're not seeing or hearing this,
are you?

238
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,782
Seeing or hearing...

239
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,085
I thought so.

240
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,413
Man, this lizard's got
a half-life like uranium.

241
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,999
So the guy with the axes,
which tent's he hang his thong in?

242
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,386
Have we identified the leader
of the Serpent group yet?

243
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,301
Not yet, but we're looking.

244
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,684
Where?

245
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,102
Phyllis is in charge
of that investigation.

246
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:17,896
I could join her.

247
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,835
Perhaps there are places
she doesn't know to look

248
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,567
that I would,
considering my past.

249
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,565
That's a very generous offer.

250
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:29,529
But it seems that you have
enough on your plate already.

251
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,155
Hmm.

252
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,281
Very well.

253
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,829
MARGO: I was just
sitting in a bar

254
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:36,373
when a bear named Humbledrum
started talking to me.

255
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,543
What can I tell you?
Fillory's a weird place.

256
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:40,962
So I hear.

257
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,955
- But you...
- Mmm-hmm.

258
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,881
- A woman...
- Mmm-hmm.

259
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,209
- As king?
- Talking animals.

260
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,183
I'm gonna go
get some more.

261
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:14,746
ELIOT: Wow.

262
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,538
Light speed, Bambi.

263
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,287
Okay, can you just tell me?

264
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:20,959
What the hell are you?

265
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,581
Pieces of you.

266
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:24,295
Your spirit guide.

267
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:27,170
Your memories.
Your Eliot.

268
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,088
Your conscience.

269
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:32,888
- Speaking of conscience...
- Wait, what?

270
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,556
You're really gonna
pass lycanthropy

271
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,679
to a guy who lives
on a planet with two moons?

272
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,122
I'll tell them I'm surfing
the red breakers,

273
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:39,226
and we got to get creative.

274
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,104
And this is just
to get the axes.

275
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,770
- Out, now.
- (MUSIC PLAYING)

276
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,280
And this is
guiding me how?

277
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:56,078
It's the song you think to yourself
whenever you're working a guy, remember?

278
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,656
High school,
junior year?

279
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,792
- Ray Latanza.
- Ray Latanza.

280
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,039
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

281
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,870
This song came out
on the car radio.

282
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,707
I wanted to ride in his Porsche,
so I gave him a hand job.

283
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,917
In your own driveway,
which is sad,

284
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:11,252
'cause then your dad
walked out.

00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,428

<i>Here I go again</i>

293
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:46,795
Hey, Margo.
Thanks for inviting me.

294
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:48,088
I invited her?

295
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,173
(SINGING) <i>Though I keep searching

<i>I ain't wasting no more time</i>

305
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:46,263
The Library says that they have
sufficient levels of ambient magic.

306
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,937
Magic output reports
are published weekly.

307
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,735
Yeah, well, we didn't trust
them, and guess what.

308
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,355
Look.

309
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:58,533
This is how much magic the Library says is
being distributed as ambient.

310
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,537
And this is the level
in the pipes right now.

311
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:07,076
It's nothing close to the amount
of magic they say there is.

312
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:12,169
So long as Library members
get their Deweys, who cares?

313
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,300
Beside hedges.

314
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:16,672
- That can't be right.
- It is.

315
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,008
We bugged the pipes.

316
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,511
A beetle
with McCormick's tracer.

317
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,302
Were you mapping
the pipe system?

318
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:27,262
Trying to.

319
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,895
Until our beetle disintegrated
somewhere outside Earth.

320
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,977
But the spell
shows magic levels.

321
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,110
And when we saw this,
we thought we should show you,

322
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:36,522
because I don't think
you signed up

323
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:39,859
to work for an organization
that lies, right?

324
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,365
- I'm sure there's an explanation.
- There is.

325
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,539
Harriet told you and me.

326
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,208
Everett's trying
to squeeze out hedges.

327
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,035
This is just
more of the same.

328
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,371
Look, you are on the inside.

329
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:56,216
You can find out where
the extra magic is going

330
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:59,636
and why they're hoarding it
and why the Library is lying.

331
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,221
Mmm.

332
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,217
MARGO: Yeah, sweetie.
Just let me borrow them.

333
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:08,224
I'll have them back in a day,
two at the most.

334
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,774
- No one else can use them but me.
- Mmm!

335
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:14,438
They're enchanted.

336
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:17,737
As I'm sure you can understand
better than most.

337
00:19:19,033 --> 00:19:20,740
I, uh... (CHUCKLES)

338
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,652
I loved it last night
when you did that thing to me.

339
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:29,207
(SIGHS) What are you,
some kind of witch?

340
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:30,794
Magician.

341
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,624
So can I get ones
that work for me?

342
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,505
You'll have to make your own.

343
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,082
Swell. How?

344
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,260
Mostly white, no?

345
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,099
But every hundredth
grain or so...

346
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,276
Is black.

347
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:56,903
Mmm.

348
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,275
A warrior goes
alone into the desert,

349
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:01,940
picks out only the black ones,

350
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,492
