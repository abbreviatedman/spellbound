1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,441
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,603 --> 00:00:04,037
My mother was a
hedge witch, too.

3
00:00:04,104 --> 00:00:05,663
I didn't know you were a hedge.

4
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:08,709
Oh, yes. My mentor,
Everett, found me.

5
00:00:19,987 --> 00:00:22,980
The Foremost saved
them with special weapons

6
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:24,251
that expel possession.

7
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:27,385
They call them ice axes, and
I'm assuming that's poetic license.

8
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:29,157
So, we might have a
chance to save Eliot.

9
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,092
Overthrow me right
the fuck now, Fen.

10
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:34,566
I never should have...
Or I will never forgive you.

11
00:00:34,635 --> 00:00:35,796
And neither will Eliot,

12
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,668
if you keep me from getting
the one thing that can save him.

13
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:43,975
When the going gets tough,

14
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,774
tough listens to pop
anthems from the '80s.

15
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:49,183
Hi. It's me. It's the
real me. It's Eliot.

16
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:52,014
This is a mind palace situation
and we don't have a lot of time,

17
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:54,005
and I have some extremely
major shit to tell you.

18
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:55,988
<i>Some god of war.</i>

19
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,049
He only liked them when
they were too weak to fight.

20
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:00,651
He's not trying to
rebuild his body.

21
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:01,938
That's not what the stones are.

22
00:01:01,962 --> 00:01:04,557
That's not what they're for.

23
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:05,963
It's so much worse than that.

24
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:11,534
Just breathe. If the stones
aren't for building a body,

25
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:12,715
what does he want with them?

26
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,733
No, he's building
a body. His sister's.

27
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,369
He's trying to bring
her back to life.

28
00:01:19,446 --> 00:01:20,573
Oh, my God.

29
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:24,976
That's the girl he thought was a sacrifice
to summon Enyalius, but she wasn't.

30
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:26,563
Enyalius and the
other gods killed her.

31
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:29,250
They chopped her up and
turned her into four stone organs.

32
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:32,350
Jesus. There's
two of them. Yeah.

33
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,486
And if he got prison and
she got the death penalty,

34
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:36,052
I'm guessing she's the bad one.

35
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,430
Till he remembers,

36
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,756
he won't know to go
looking for Enyalius.

37
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:43,803
Hi.

38
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:48,539
If you want to talk to
me, the price is a drink.

39
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:50,433
You're fun.

40
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,049
One drink.

41
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:58,245
What are you having,
ma'am? Vodka ice.

42
00:01:58,318 --> 00:01:59,581
Vodka ice.

43
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,422
There you go.

44
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,328
I have a question. No,
I don't come here often.

45
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:11,024
You haven't seen me anywhere.

46
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:13,795
And, yes, I do have
plans this weekend.

47
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:14,934
Still have a question?

48
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:16,969
Yes.

49
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:21,771
Why does this place
smell like death?

50
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,007
It is weird, right?

51
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,609
Bar next to a hospital.

52
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:36,115
Doctors need happy
hour, too, I guess.

53
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:39,523
So that's what
you are? A doctor?

54
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,319
No.

55
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,254
I'm sick.

56
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:47,401
But I got good news today.

57
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,369
I'll only be sick for
another two months.

58
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,104
Three, maybe.

59
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:59,704
Sometimes my friend says one
thing but means another thing.

60
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,809
Is that what you're doing?

61
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:07,316
Keep 'em coming.
Keep 'em coming.

62
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,721
<i>Meet me in a restaurant</i>

63
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,524
<i>Meet me on the top of the world</i>

64
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:25,336
<i>Meet me And we'll
talk the language of love</i>

65
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:32,504
<i>I'll meet you anywhere you want</i>

66
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,307
<i>I'll meet you on
a ballroom floor</i>

67
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,783
Well, I'm definitely hitting
my step goals today, huh?

68
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:41,583
<i>Meet me and we'll
float to the level above</i>

69
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:46,118
<i>I wish you'd drop
what you're doing</i>

70
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,132
Jesus, fuck, a
wise man's donkey.

71
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,245
Just give me a sign.

72
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:10,614
Come on. Where's water?

73
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:11,684
Anything.

74
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:52,851
Wait.

75
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:57,929
<i>Don't get me wrong</i>

76
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:03,033
<i>If I'm looking kind of dazzled</i>

77
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,401
El?

78
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:08,636
<i>I see neon lights</i>

79
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:12,109
<i>Whenever you walk by</i>

80
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:13,203
Eliot?

81
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,079
<i>Don't get me wrong</i>

82
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,674
Oh, my God.

83
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:21,346
<i>If you say hello
and I take a ride</i>

84
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:26,059
<i>Upon a sea where the mystic moon</i>

85
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,759
<i>Is playing havoc with the tide</i>

86
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,526
Hey! It's you, right?

87
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:33,066
<i>Don't get me wrong</i>

88
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:35,830
It can't be The Monster.
He doesn't have the moves.

89
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:37,762
Hey, what are you doing here?

90
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:41,635
Turn down the music
and talk to me, will you?

91
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,176
Wait a sec.

92
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:46,206
Whoa.

93
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:48,844
Oh, my God. I'm
tripping on lizard.

94
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:53,816
<i>Don't get me wrong</i>

95
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:58,690
<i>If I'm acting so distracted</i>

96
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:03,361
<i>I'm thinking about the fireworks</i>

97
00:06:03,663 --> 00:06:05,188
Oh, come on.

98
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:08,667
<i>That go off when you smile</i>

99
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,833
<i>Don't get me wrong</i>

100
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:17,569
<i>If I split like light refracted</i>

101
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:22,638
<i>I'm only off to wander</i>

102
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:27,779
<i>Across a moonlit mile</i>

103
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:34,722
<i>Once in a while, two people meet</i>

104
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:39,755
<i>Seemingly for no reason
They just pass on the street</i>

105
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:44,032
<i>Suddenly thundershowers
everywhere</i>

106
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,870
<i>Who can explain
the thunder and rain?</i>

107
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,774
Don't get me wrong.
I'm happy to see you.

108
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,670
Where are you taking
me, Eliot? I'm so thirsty.

109
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,375
<i>Don't get me wrong</i>

110
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,520
<i>If I come and go like fashion</i>

111
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,690
<i>I might be great tomorrow</i>

112
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:10,894
<i>But hopeless yesterday</i>

113
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:15,925
<i>Don't get me wrong</i>

114
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:18,938
<i>If I fall in the mode of passion</i>

115
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,642
<i>It might be unbelievable</i>

116
00:07:25,378 --> 00:07:28,815
<i>But let's not say so long</i>

117
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:32,008
<i>It might be just fantastic</i>

118
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,083
<i>Don't get me wrong</i>

119
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,497
Woman, hello.

120
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:53,806
Oh, hey.

121
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:55,975
Hi.

122
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:01,847
Can't believe that psychotropic
douche got me here.

123
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:04,945
Can I get some water?

124
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:09,448
Who wants the
honor of killing her?

125
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:11,548
Hey, if water's a
dealio, I'm good.

126
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:13,320
Oh, we have water.

127
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:14,759
What we don't have are strangers

128
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,296
wandering into
our camp. Her wrist.

129
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,703
Our enemy's enemy is our ally.

130
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,098
Well, how about that?

131
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,220
You're in pain, aren't you?

132
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,358
Come with me.

133
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,094
I can take it away.

134
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:50,653
Sorry, but I got to get home

135
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:54,167
and tell my parents all the
medical debt was for nothing.

136
00:08:58,838 --> 00:08:59,838
Thanks for the drinks.

137
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:01,774
Wait.

138
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,634
Do that again.

139
00:09:06,646 --> 00:09:07,646
My face.

140
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:10,439
Touch my face.

141
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,019
Are you okay?

142
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,951
Whenever you touch my
face, I remember something.

143
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,530
Again.

144
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:31,463
You remind me of
someone I had forgotten...

145
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,540
My sister.

146
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:36,341
I'm gonna leave.

147
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,640
No, you have to
come with me now.

148
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:39,940
No, I'm...

149
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:50,513
What's up?

150
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:53,218
This was in the Mirror World.

151
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:55,922
And I heard you were
looking for the binder, so...

152
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,531
Holy shit.

153
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,864
It's in some language
I've never seen before. I...

154
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:06,031
Well, I'll get on this just
as soon as we find Enyalius.

155
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,904
Hopefully before
The Monster does.

156
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,841
I thought we wanted
him to find Enyalius.

157
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:13,038
Yeah, we did, but we were wrong.

158
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,604
He's building his sister.

159
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:17,611
What are y'all doing?

160
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:21,214
Tracking the Library's
entire magic infrastructure

161
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,779
to find weak points
and start a rebellion.

162
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:28,323
But, um, good luck with yours.

163
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:30,727
Yeah. Thanks. You, too.

164
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,595
Yeah, I can tell you
what he looks like,

165
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,700
the food the dude likes to eat,

166
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:36,668
but shit-all for
anything useful.

167
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,568
One thing is bugging me.

168
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,867
In the memory,

169
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,135
I could swear he was
wearing a ring, emerald.

170
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:46,173
Guy is described up and
down, but nothing about the ring.

171
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:47,423
Wait a minute. Did
you say emerald?

172
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:48,447
Yeah.

173
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:51,513
When I did research
with the Free Traders,

174
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:54,349
there was this god.
What was his name? Uh...

175
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:57,256
He... He always
worked in disguise,

176
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:01,260
but he was known for always
wearing an emerald ring.

177
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,819
So Enyalius is a front.

178
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:05,092
Here.

179
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,292
Aengus.

180
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,824
Celtic god.

181
00:11:11,604 --> 00:11:14,130
Jules, it says here
he's a trickster. It's fine.

182
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:17,439
And we... It wouldn't
be a summoning.

183
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,979
We can only get to him
through a magical creature.

184
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,810
Apparently there's
a whole species

185
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:24,783
that exists to entertain
him and protect him.

186
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,912
And they're really
annoying and...

187
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:31,389
What I'm getting at is, we
need to find a leprechaun.

188
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:53,273
Don't! I'm sorry.

189
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:56,441
Listen, I... I just saw
this red sand out there.

190
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:57,609
It was following me.

191
00:11:57,684 --> 00:11:59,812
I thought it was 'cause
I was tripping balls.

192
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:01,846
Our desert is alive.

193
00:12:02,622 --> 00:12:05,057
It's filled with demon spirits
that attack our women.

194
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:08,288
Okay.

195
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:11,422
Speaking of D-spirits,
I'm looking for something

196
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:13,796
I think you guys have. MAN:
You know what can happen.

197
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:15,077
A pair of black... WOMAN:
You're angry with me?

198
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,763
How dare you?

199
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,181
You lay with my sister, and
I'm the one you scream at?

200
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:20,696
I'm the one you threaten?

201
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:23,265
Zal, calm yourself. Pig!

202
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,187
You want my sister? She's yours.

203
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:26,270
Wow.

204
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:28,013
Desert Dynasty.

205
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,811
Think we're gonna
get a girl fight?

206
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:32,147
Jesus, how long
does one lick last?

207
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:34,517
Take her. You two
deserve each other.

208
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,352
You must be silent! Now.

209
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:51,903
Gross.

210
00:12:52,805 --> 00:12:55,502
But cool, but gross.

211
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:21,097
So, anytime a woman
gets a teensy bit emotional,

212
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:24,035
one of those things rises
up out of the sand, and what?

213
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,228
Possesses her.

214
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,870
Eventually causing
paralysis, even death.

215
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:32,173
Men save us because they
alone have the strength to survive.

216
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:34,305
And the spirit
zoo you got going?

217
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,746
They can't be killed,

218
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,681
so I've learned how
to imprison them.

219
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:40,251
Some brave dudes.

220
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,112
And some awfully
compliant women.

221
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:51,962
You're not seeing or
hearing this, are you?

222
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,793
Seeing or hearing...

223
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:57,102
I thought so.

224
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,436
Man, this lizard's got
a half-life like uranium.

225
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,999
So the guy with the axes,
which tent's he hang his thong in?

226
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:08,372
Have we identified the leader
of the Serpent group yet?

227
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,313
Not yet, but we're looking.

228
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,708
Where?

229
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:15,118
Phyllis is in charge
of that investigation.

230
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:17,922
I could join her.

231
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,835
Perhaps there are places
she doesn't know to look

232
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,590
that I would,
considering my past.

233
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:24,563
That's a very generous offer.

234
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:29,535
But it seems that you have
enough on your plate already.

235
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:31,163
Hmm.

236
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:32,296
Very well.

237
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,840
I was just sitting in a bar

238
00:14:33,906 --> 00:14:36,375
when a bear named
Humbledrum started talking to me.

239
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:39,537
What can I tell you?
Fillory's a weird place.

240
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:40,970
So I hear.

241
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:42,981
But you... Mmm-hmm.

242
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,915
A woman... Mmm-hmm.

243
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:47,215
As king? Talking animals.

244
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,195
I'm gonna go get some more.

245
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:14,746
Wow.

246
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:16,544
Light speed, Bambi.

247
00:15:16,883 --> 00:15:19,318
Okay, can you just tell me?

248
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:20,978
What the hell are you?

249
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:22,578
Pieces of you.

250
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:24,315
Your spirit guide.

251
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,189
Your memories. Your Eliot.

252
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,084
Your conscience.

253
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:32,894
Speaking of
conscience... Wait, what?

254
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,558
You're really gonna
pass lycanthropy

255
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:36,694
to a guy who lives on a
planet with two moons?

256
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,113
I'll tell them I'm surfing
the red breakers,

257
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:39,217
and we got to get creative.

258
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,104
And this is just
to get the axes.

259
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:43,642
Out, now.

260
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:50,280
And this is guiding me how?

261
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:56,078
It's the song you think to yourself
whenever you're working a guy, remember?

262
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,650
High school, junior year?

263
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,792
Ray Latanza. Ray Latanza.

264
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:03,056
Yeah. Yeah.

265
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,893
This song came
out on the car radio.

266
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,729
I wanted to ride in his Porsche,
so I gave him a hand job.

267
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,928
In your own
driveway, which is sad,

268
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:11,282
'cause then your dad walked out.

269
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,431
Okay, road closure
on Memory Lane.

270
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:18,042
<i>I don't know where I'm going</i>

271
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:23,245
<i>But I sure know where I've been</i>

272
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:29,248
<i>Hanging on the promises
in the songs of yesterday</i>

273
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:33,084
<i>'Cause I've made up my mind</i>

274
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:37,592
<i>I ain't wasting no more time</i>

275
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,326
<i>Here I go again</i>

276
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:45,129
<i>Here I go again</i>

277
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:46,797
Hey, Margo. Thanks
for inviting me.

278
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:48,102
I invited her?

279
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:53,177
<i>Though I keep
searching for an answer</i>

280
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:59,309
<i>I never seem to find
what I'm looking for</i>

281
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:04,517
<i>O Lord, I pray You give
me the strength to carry on</i>

282
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:09,295
<i>'Cause I know what it means</i>

283
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:13,026
<i>To walk along the
lonely street of dreams</i>

284
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:19,161
<i>Here I go again on my own</i>

285
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:23,676
<i>Going down the only
road I've ever known</i>

286
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:28,478
<i>Like a drifter, I was
born to walk alone</i>

287
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:34,617
<i>And I made up my mind</i>

288
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:38,658
<i>I ain't wasting no more time</i>

289
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:46,261
The Library says that they have
sufficient levels of ambient magic.

290
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:49,966
Magic output reports
are published weekly.

291
00:17:50,036 --> 00:17:52,733
Yeah, well, we didn't
trust them, and guess what.

292
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,366
Look.

293
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,536
This is how much magic the Library
says is being distributed as ambient.

294
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:02,544
And this is the level
in the pipes right now.

295
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:07,082
It's nothing close to the amount
of magic they say there is.

296
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:12,152
So long as Library members
get their Deweys, who cares?

297
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,291
Beside hedges.

298
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:16,692
That can't be right. It is.

299
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:18,988
We bugged the pipes.

300
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:22,492
A beetle with
McCormick's tracer.

301
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,336
Were you mapping
the pipe system?

302
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:27,270
Trying to.

303
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:30,902
Until our beetle disintegrated
somewhere outside Earth.

304
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:33,003
But the spell
shows magic levels.

305
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:35,119
And when we saw this, we
thought we should show you,

306
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,547
because I don't
think you signed up

307
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:39,882
to work for an
organization that lies, right?

308
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,387
I'm sure there's an
explanation. There is.

309
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,550
Harriet told you and me.

310
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,220
Everett's trying to
squeeze out hedges.

311
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:50,058
This is just more of the same.

312
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,360
Look, you are on the inside.

313
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,233
You can find out where
the extra magic is going

314
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:59,636
and why they're hoarding it
and why the Library is lying.

315
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,199
Mmm.

316
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:05,237
Yeah, sweetie. Just
let me borrow them.

317
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:08,247
I'll have them back in
a day, two at the most.

318
00:19:09,448 --> 00:19:12,782
No one else can use
them but me. Mmm!

319
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,443
They're enchanted.

320
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,718
As I'm sure you can
understand better than most.

321
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:20,755
I, uh...

322
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:23,658
I loved it last night when
you did that thing to me.

323
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:29,201
What are you,
some kind of witch?

324
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:30,802
Magician.

325
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,639
So can I get ones
that work for me?

326
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,505
You'll have to make your own.

327
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:37,065
Swell. How?

328
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:48,280
Mostly white, no?

329
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,080
But every hundredth
grain or so...

330
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,260
Is black.

331
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:56,895
Mmm.

332
00:19:57,363 --> 00:19:59,298
A warrior goes
alone into the desert,

333
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:01,967
picks out only the black ones,

334
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,504
enough to fill a large bag,

335
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:06,767
which is then forged.

336
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:08,573
Thanks.

337
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:12,139
You're gonna try? I'm gonna do.

338
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:16,410
If you get the least bit emotional,
the spirits will possess you.

339
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:18,143
Clear on that.

340
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,186
And there'll be no
man to protect you.

341
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:23,222
Story of my life. And
you can't use magic.

342
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:25,884
It renders the
grains... Impotent?

343
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,990
I don't know that word. You
sure don't, Marathon Man.

344
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,226
<i>I'm just another
heart in need of rescue</i>

345
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,304
<i>Waiting on love's sweet charity</i>

346
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:48,746
<i>And I'm gonna hold on
for the rest of my days</i>

347
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:51,510
What is she doing here?

348
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,712
Four-octave range,
bitch. Seriously?

349
00:20:53,786 --> 00:20:55,846
I got my id, my lost innocence,

350
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:59,221
my guilt, and now my inadequacy?

351
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:03,696
<i>'Cause I know what it means</i>

352
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:08,030
<i>To walk along the
lonely street of dreams</i>

353
00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:13,197
<i>And here I go again on my own</i>

354
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:18,104
<i>Going down the only
road I've ever known</i>

355
00:21:19,011 --> 00:21:23,176
<i>Like a drifter, I was
born to walk alone</i>

356
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:28,446
<i>And I've made up my mind</i>

357
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:33,218
<i>I ain't wasting no more time</i>

358
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,261
<i>But here I go again</i>

359
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:36,886
Okay, this is too much.

360
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,988
Your subconscious thought
you needed some wisdom.

361
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:42,523
You do whiskey, not wisdom.

362
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,661
Okay. Fine.

363
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:48,798
<i>And I made up my mind</i>

364
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:53,670
<i>I ain't wasting no more time</i>

365
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:55,214
Show-off.

366
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:58,945
<i>Here I go again</i>

367
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:04,222
<i>Here I go again</i>

368
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:09,626
<i>Here I go again</i>

369
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:16,433
<i>Here I go!</i>

370
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:24,119
Ah, morning. What
can I do you for?

371
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:27,045
Uh, we were hoping that you
could help us find somebody.

372
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:30,276
Well, I'm not sure about that,
but, uh, I can fix your shoes.

373
00:22:32,251 --> 00:22:35,119
Uh, this is Berry's,
right? Yeah.

374
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,088
I'm Berry, so...

375
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:38,454
We're looking for a leprechaun.

376
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:46,959
Right. So are you looking for,
like, a pot-of-gold leprechaun,

377
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,831
or is this a breakfast-cereal
situation, or...

378
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:51,313
We're looking for a
god named Aengus,

379
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:53,014
but to find him we have
to talk to a leprechaun first,

380
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,507
and I know this is a
bat-shit thing to say

381
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:57,839
with a straight face,
but if you could help us...

382
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:03,038
Well, all right, since
you're desperate.

383
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:04,978
Are you the leprechaun?

384
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,986
What do you expect some
short little bearded child in overalls

385
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,385
with a buckle on me hat?

386
00:23:09,855 --> 00:23:10,932
Why didn't you just tell us?

387
00:23:10,956 --> 00:23:12,836
Because you're hysterical
when you're desperate.

388
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:23,007
Want to see Aengus?

389
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:24,435
He's right through there.

390
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,340
Great. No knob.

391
00:23:32,978 --> 00:23:34,344
Someone's trying
to kill your boss,

392
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,882
and we need to warn him,
so, please, just let us through.

393
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:38,508
No.

394
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:41,616
Aengus is pretty strict on
that. Keeps out the riffraff.

395
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:43,348
Don't worry.

396
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,823
Everything you need to
open the door is in here.

397
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,018
It's fun.

398
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:50,620
It's an escape room,
like for kids' parties.

399
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:52,964
Not ours.

400
00:24:56,695 --> 00:25:02,726
<i>Beautiful dreamer</i>

401
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:07,634
<i>Wake unto me</i>

402
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:13,473
<i>Starlight and dew drops</i>

403
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:17,607
<i>Are waiting for thee</i>

404
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,150
Enough.

405
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:23,487
You loved this song when you
were little and your father sang it.

406
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:25,251
You're me, right?

407
00:25:25,324 --> 00:25:27,486
I run me, so shut it.

408
00:26:13,505 --> 00:26:14,505
Yes.

409
00:26:19,078 --> 00:26:21,411
It's okay. I think I can get
it. Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.

410
00:26:22,881 --> 00:26:23,881
Lets the knob down,

411
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:26,389
but if you stick your arm up
there, you'll just get sliced up.

412
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:29,664
We have no idea how close The
Monster is. So, if I get cut, I get cut.

413
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:31,208
We don't have time
to argue about this.

414
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,885
Stupid, 'cause one of
us here is indestructible.

415
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:57,314
It's you. Julia.

416
00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:00,752
Aengus has been
very interested in you.

417
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:01,979
What's that supposed to mean?

418
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,880
No, no, nothing to worry.

419
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:08,724
We've all been interested in the girl
who became the goddess who became...

420
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:11,263
Shit. We still need a key.

421
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:14,477
Well, then maybe Aengus would
appreciate if you let us through.

422
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:15,760
Aw...

423
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:16,834
I can't.

424
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:26,840
I quit. I can't do this anymore.

425
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:28,608
That goddamn lullaby.

426
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:32,742
He'd sing it every night to me.

427
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:36,282
Even away on business,

428
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:39,015
he'd sing it over the phone.

429
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:42,988
He called me
his little princess.

430
00:27:44,897 --> 00:27:46,866
He was better than other dads.

431
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,659
And he thought I was
better than other daughters.

432
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:56,942
Until... You had the
audacity to grow up.

433
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,245
Fuckin' apologies
for the surprise, Dad.

434
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:03,715
He saw what he raised...

435
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:06,218
A woman he couldn't control.

436
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:09,045
Who didn't need
anyone else's approval.

437
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:12,353
Nothing deadlier to
the fragile male ego.

438
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,862
He was the one who told
me I could be anything.

439
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,694
And I believed him.

440
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:26,002
But he didn't tell you that
the world makes you choose.

441
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:28,665
You can be one of the smart ones

442
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:32,700
or one of the pretty ones
or even a strong one.

443
00:28:32,778 --> 00:28:35,373
But... Try to be all three...

444
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:39,409
You better learn to
smile and shut up...

445
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,320
'Cause the second you're you,

446
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,322
the second...

447
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,824
Out loud, pissed off,

448
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,826
it's, "What a bitch."

449
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:51,724
"What a slut."

450
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:54,429
"Who the fuck does
she think she is?"

451
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:58,837
So you never give them a chance.

452
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:00,397
You hit first.

453
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:05,541
And anyone dumb enough to hit back
soon finds that there's no hurting you,

454
00:29:06,044 --> 00:29:10,209
sheathed in all that
hard, glossy armor.

455
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:12,914
Then why does it hurt so much?

456
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:19,246
Why does it feel like
I'm losing my mind, Eliot?

457
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,118
Wind and sand

458
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,728
reduce mountains into rubble.

459
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:29,566
Are you stronger
than a mountain?

460
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:33,633
I'm a king.

461
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,266
Not a goddamn princess.

462
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:39,577
A king.

463
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:42,546
You were.

464
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:46,817
I'm still a king.

465
00:29:50,756 --> 00:29:52,657
King of manipulation.

466
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:56,056
King of pointless rage.

467
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,427
King of "I can't do this."

468
00:29:59,064 --> 00:30:01,033
King of "He was right."

469
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:07,099
King of "I eventually
fuck up everything."

470
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:10,233
That's not true. That's
what Eliot would say.

471
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:12,176
But you're not Eliot, are you?

472
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:15,409
You're me.

473
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:19,481
And we know.

474
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:23,513
Margo. Don't...

475
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:24,989
Get angry?

476
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:29,561
I'm angry

477
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:31,529
every second.

478
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:36,995
Every second my eyes are
open because I know who I am.

479
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:39,594
Not what I pretend to be.

480
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,169
Can't do anything
except pose and judge.

481
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:46,973
Margo, you have to stop.

482
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,544
The only thing I ever did
right was be your best friend.

483
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:57,347
That's the only
thing I ever got right.

484
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:59,118
And I can't even do that,

485
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,183
or else this fucking bag

486
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,125
would be fucking full!

487
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:44,869
Wait.

488
00:31:47,506 --> 00:31:48,506
You're a girl?

489
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:54,737
Sorry, woman. Female?

490
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:57,538
And how am I hearing you?

491
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,220
You're in my thoughts.

492
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:04,013
Who isn't?

493
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,381
Are you getting
this? Yeah, of course.

494
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:07,458
Of course.

495
00:32:09,628 --> 00:32:12,530
So then maybe you can tell
me if you're a womanish thing,

496
00:32:13,465 --> 00:32:16,731
why do you do such shitty
things to other women?

497
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:20,938
What?

498
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:24,608
Fuck. Fuck.

499
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:30,279
- Last one.
- It doesn't work.

500
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:31,949
God damn it.

501
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:35,654
Come on.

502
00:32:41,226 --> 00:32:42,660
You may enter.

503
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:45,253
Aengus. Or, Enyalius.

504
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,108
Whatever your name is.
Do we... We're too late.

505
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,293
Shit. Shit.

506
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:53,096
Oh, your face.

507
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:55,163
What the hell, dude? We
were trying to warn you.

508
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,641
Yeah, yeah, I got you good.

509
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:01,739
Your anxieties are glowing.

510
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,442
This one especially. The
Monster is coming for you.

511
00:33:04,516 --> 00:33:07,111
The one that you
locked up in Blackspire.

512
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:10,920
You care for a snack? Something to
drink? I mean, you've certainly earned it.

513
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,754
No. No. We... We
want you to leave.

514
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,623
I have a place to hide.

515
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:19,927
I just refuse to let
your panic infect me.

516
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:22,290
Happiness is a choice, you know.

517
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:24,097
Yeah, well, you should
turn the panic up.

518
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:26,104
We wasted so much time
in your escape-room shit,

519
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:28,106
The Monster could
be here any second.

520
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:35,511
You mortals are always
so precious about time.

521
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,947
"There's never enough of it."

522
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:41,612
"Ahh! Every second,
I'm closer to death. Ahh!"

523
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,716
Well, yes, but...

524
00:33:44,055 --> 00:33:47,685
How can you enjoy life if
you're in constant fear of its end?

525
00:33:48,293 --> 00:33:52,492
Think on it. Except
you, of course, Julia.

526
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,129
It's a fascinating pleasure.

527
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:58,466
We're trying to save you.

528
00:33:58,537 --> 00:33:59,800
You need to hide now.

529
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:01,197
Hide?

530
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:05,268
Yes, it took me a while to
shake the mortal fear, too.

531
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,946
You'll get there.

532
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:12,074
So that's a no on the snacks?

533
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:17,118
I did hope that the decoy and
alias would keep him at bay,

534
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:18,952
but just in case...

535
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:22,526
Fallout shelter of sorts.

536
00:34:22,594 --> 00:34:25,655
No one, not even The
Monster, can get in.

537
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,859
It's gonna be so
very boring, but, uh...

538
00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:32,535
Since you insist.

539
00:34:32,604 --> 00:34:35,506
Thank God. You're most welcome.

540
00:34:36,107 --> 00:34:38,702
But before I,
um... Jesus Christ.

541
00:34:39,611 --> 00:34:42,513
Julia, come with me.

542
00:34:43,181 --> 00:34:44,181
What?

543
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:47,083
I know a thing or two
about god powers.

544
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:49,984
I'm sure I can fix
whatever's wrong with you.

545
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,825
We're more alike than you know.

546
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,096
Think it over.

547
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:04,998
Whilst I remember my password.

548
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,206
So, can we do
this thing or what?

549
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:20,548
I don't mean to be
brusque. Do what?

550
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:22,815
Turn my black sand into axes.

551
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:25,489
Uh-oh.

552
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,957
Guys, whatever
the joke is, skip it.

553
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:31,455
It's just so...
Richly enjoyable.

554
00:35:31,563 --> 00:35:32,758
Not to mention a first.

555
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:35,460
You should feel good at least.

556
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:39,100
No other woman has ever gone
alone out there and come back

557
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,570
with all of that.

558
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,134
Most give up. Or die.

559
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:45,638
Yeah, hilarious.

560
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:48,770
I can't believe your
kingdom exiled you.

561
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:51,510
You're strong, smart...

562
00:35:53,418 --> 00:35:55,353
And a very adequate whore.

563
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:57,815
Oh, yeah, it's a big uh-oh.

564
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:01,836
You know, a funny
thing happened out there.

565
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,420
I met one of them,
a demon spirit.

566
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:08,191
And I got the whole download
on how this place really rolls.

567
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,269
See, I lost my shit,

568
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:13,296
<i>in a big way.</i>

569
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:15,265
And she came up out of the sand.

570
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,367
Only, I didn't see
shifty, scary smoke.

571
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,543
<i>I saw her.</i>

572
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:25,946
Maybe it's this
weirdo fairy eye I have.

573
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,952
It's a long and
very bizarre story

574
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,750
for another day
and another quest.

575
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,788
<i>But I also heard her.</i>

576
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,358
<i>She didn't attack me.</i>

577
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:39,364
<i>That's not what they do.</i>

578
00:36:39,998 --> 00:36:41,678
But you guys already
know that, don't know?

579
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:45,633
You and your whole ruling council
of pussy-phobic chuckle-dicks.

580
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:48,230
'Cause those spirits,
when they hear a woman

581
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:51,242
who's sad or scared or upset...

582
00:36:52,477 --> 00:36:54,070
Or angry...

583
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,579
They rise up out
of the sand to help.

584
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:03,445
And they help by possessing
whatever man is causing the distress.

585
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:07,185
They're protectors.

586
00:37:09,461 --> 00:37:11,555
<i>And if the problem isn't a man,</i>

587
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:17,928
<i>they do whatever it
takes to help women.</i>

588
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:35,080
If your intent is to tell
our people those lies,

589
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,218
then I'm sorry,

590
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,884
but that's not gonna happen.

591
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,892
If your intent was
to double-cross me,

592
00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:46,261
you missed a key
plot point, shit-crisp.

593
00:37:47,132 --> 00:37:49,863
I'm a fuckin' magician.

594
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:59,371
<i>There's a storm on the way</i>

595
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,413
<i>All right</i>

596
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:07,715
<i>There's a storm on the way</i>

597
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:14,286
<i>And it's coming no
matter what I say</i>

598
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:17,926
<i>There's truth in the thunder</i>

599
00:38:18,096 --> 00:38:19,428
<i>There's love in the lightning</i>

600
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:20,726
<i>The feeling is frightening</i>

601
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:22,461
<i>But isn't it exciting?</i>

602
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:24,365
<i>I'm something
like stormy weather</i>

603
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:27,701
<i>If I weren't, we'd
never huddle together</i>

604
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:28,899
<i>Do I have to tell you</i>

605
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,909
<i>That I'm also the sunlight
that shines shortly after?</i>

606
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,911
<i>I just rain 'cause I have to</i>

607
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,470
<i>On to another chapter, I
wish you lots of laughter</i>

608
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:38,516
<i>Till the next time you see me</i>

609
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:44,454
<i>Just remember you need
me, I'm the storm coming</i>

610
00:38:44,522 --> 00:38:46,047
<i>Just remember you need me</i>

611
00:38:46,124 --> 00:38:49,424
<i>I'm the storm coming</i>

612
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,053
<i>So here I come, I come, I come</i>

613
00:38:51,129 --> 00:38:52,461
No...

614
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:56,733
<i>I'm the storm coming</i>

615
00:38:57,202 --> 00:38:58,727
<i>Just remember you need me</i>

616
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:00,294
<i>I'm the storm coming</i>

617
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:01,805
<i>I wish you lots of laughter</i>

618
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:03,466
<i>Till the next time you see me</i>

619
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:04,907
<i>Just remember you need me</i>

620
00:39:04,976 --> 00:39:06,740
<i>I'm the storm coming</i>

621
00:39:09,614 --> 00:39:11,606
<i>Just remember you need me</i>

622
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:14,448
<i>I'm the storm coming</i>

623
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:17,717
<i>So here I come, I come, I come</i>

624
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:19,314
<i>I'm the storm coming</i>

625
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:20,915
<i>Come on</i>

626
00:39:20,992 --> 00:39:24,087
<i>Here I come, I come, I come</i>

627
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:27,462
<i>Don't ask why</i>

628
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:29,433
<i>Just live</i>

629
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,993
<i>And die</i>

630
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:45,006
Aren't you gonna use the axes?

631
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:46,210
No.

632
00:39:46,517 --> 00:39:48,816
Tell the spirits to
exit your husband.

633
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:52,022
They serve you... All of you.

634
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,853
Come on, ladies.

635
00:39:53,925 --> 00:39:56,656
It's time to get your head
out of the sand... Literally.

636
00:39:57,028 --> 00:39:58,326
Close your eyes.

637
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,888
Think the thought,
"Leave my husband."

638
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,943
She's talking to me.

639
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:23,286
From now on, if a demon
possesses a man or a woman,

640
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:24,845
you can just tell them to leave.

641
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:26,756
Or stay and finish them off.

642
00:40:27,292 --> 00:40:28,692
Or help with the laundry.

643
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,459
They're pretty handy.

644
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:40,998
Hey.

645
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:46,571
This isn't over.

646
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:48,539
Yes, it is.

647
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,080
No, it's not.

648
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:54,711
I'm gonna figure out whatever
the hell this, uh, binder's all about

649
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,778
and become a goddess again.

650
00:40:57,555 --> 00:40:59,547
Okay, that's not gonna
make a difference.

651
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,855
Well, yeah, there's a
ton of reasons it won't,

652
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:03,554
but when has that stopped us?

653
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,825
Look, once I finally get
this goddess shit straight...

654
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:08,932
I need you...

655
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:13,727
To help remind me
what it's like to give a shit

656
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:14,966
about other people,

657
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:18,739
to want to risk your
life to save them.

658
00:41:26,184 --> 00:41:27,516
I got it.

659
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:35,654
May I come in?

660
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:43,431
Look who's up.

661
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:45,330
Trump and Aunt Lydia.

662
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,739
Welcome to the New Desert Order.

663
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:49,535
It's gonna suck for you.

664
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:59,947
<i>Beautiful dreamer</i>

665
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:04,114
<i>Queen of my song</i>

666
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:12,824
<i>List' while I woo thee</i>

667
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:19,235
<i>With soft melody</i>

668
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:26,235
<i>Gone are the cares of</i>

669
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:30,706
<i>Life's busy throng</i>

670
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:33,045
Nice song, asshole.

671
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:37,015
<i>Beautiful dreamer</i>

672
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:42,088
<i>Awake unto me</i>

673
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:50,525
Look, I know you're just
a reptilian hallucination.

674
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:56,772
But I miss you...

675
00:42:58,276 --> 00:43:00,074
So much.

676
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:04,581
And I promise you...

677
00:43:06,184 --> 00:43:08,085
I'm gonna get you back.

678
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:29,006
<i>Sound of the rude world</i>

679
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:33,704
<i>Heard in the day</i>

680
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:39,574
<i>Led by the moonlight</i>

681
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:43,553
<i>Have all passed away</i>

682
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:52,060
<i>Beautiful dreamer</i>

683
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:56,898
<i>Queen of my song</i>

684
00:43:56,968 --> 00:44:03,772
<i>List' while I woo thee</i>
