00:00:00,968 --> 00:00:02,869
QUENTIN: <i>Previously
on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:03,604 --> 00:00:06,096
KADY: <i>Everett's trying
to squeeze out hedges.</i>

3
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:08,108
This is just more of the same.

4
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,947
We're here to study
with Mayakovsky.

5
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,983
We hear he's crazy.
MAYAKOVSKY: You heard wrong!

6
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,415
JOSH: <i>So wait.</i>

7
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:19,953
So you turned
Mayakovsky into a bear?

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,216
I can help.

9
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:23,814
Just let me stay.

10
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:27,293
You saved my life. You
can save my life 50 times.

11
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:31,264
It's not gonna change
anything between us.

12
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:33,266
Goodbye, Alice.

13
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:36,531
The Poison Room. It's where we
store books too dangerous for the public.

14
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:38,799
You must seek the Binder.

15
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,340
ALICE: <i>This was
in the Mirror World.</i>

16
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:43,172
And I heard you were
looking for the Binder, so...

17
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:45,637
Holy shit.

18
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,374
Foremost saved them

19
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:49,643
<i>with special weapons
that expel possession.</i>

20
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,116
<i>They call them ice axes,</i>

21
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:53,050
<i>and I'm assuming
that's poetic license.</i>

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,180
MARGO: <i>So we might
have a chance to save Eliot.</i>

23
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:58,558
MARGO: But Hot and
Dumb just wasn't getting it.

24
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:01,457
And that's when I
told the Foreskin,

25
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:03,622
"Welcome to the
New Desert Order.

26
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:05,495
"It's gonna suck for you."

27
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,510
Wow. You really went
through a lot to get those axes.

28
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:09,765
Call them by their names.

29
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:11,535
Sorrow,

30
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:14,008
and Sorrow. JULIA: Nice.

31
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,770
Where'd you get the axes from?

32
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:18,912
Fine. I'll tell it
one more time.

33
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:22,380
So I'm all, "Welcome to the New
Desert Order. (DOOR OPENS)

34
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:24,611
"Gonna suck for you." (GASPS)

35
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:25,846
PENNY 23: What's gonna suck?

36
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:28,484
MARGO: Telling
this story over again.

37
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:30,456
And so I was like,

38
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:33,585
"Welcome to the New Desert
Order. Gonna suck for you."

39
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:36,528
What did I miss? I'm
getting a smoothie.

40
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,156
You fuckers take this.

41
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,412
QUENTIN: You seriously... You
spent that much time in the desert,

42
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:43,676
and this never occurred to you?

43
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,499
We're dealing with
god-level monsters.

44
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,405
Who possess people.

45
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:50,406
Those axes pull the spirits out,

46
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:52,173
and then we bottle them up. Bam!

47
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:53,508
FTW.

48
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,072
All he's saying is
they're too powerful.

49
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,311
I doubt your bottles
can hold that shit.

50
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:01,219
Those monsters are
coming for us. Make it work.

51
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:02,712
Okay, but how?

52
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,520
We could cast an incorporate
bond on the bottles.

53
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:06,787
Thank you.

54
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,853
I don't know what that
is, but I hate you less now.

55
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,365
It's a way to pin a
being or object in place.

56
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:14,731
It's like a fourth-dimensional
paperweight.

57
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,430
Mayakovsky was trapped
under one for years.

58
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:20,167
We just need to pin The
Monster to your bottles

59
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,480
long enough to get rid of them.

60
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:24,269
Great. Let's do that shit, then.

61
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,807
So who knows how to
cast an incorporate bond?

62
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:31,113
I did cast an incorporate
bond on Mayakovsky,

63
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,710
but I didn't write
the spell myself.

64
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:35,153
So who wrote it?

65
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:36,713
Mayakovsky did.

66
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,123
He didn't know I was
going to use it on him.

67
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:41,821
He was the only person
capable of writing a spell

68
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:42,954
which he couldn't break.

69
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,828
He knows more things
about incorporate bonds

70
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:45,898
than anyone else does.

71
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:50,231
You wanted a spell
to trap a god, yes?

72
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,272
Well... He's the real expert.

73
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:56,105
But he's also a
bear. Not exactly.

74
00:02:56,176 --> 00:03:01,672
You see, once magic came back,
he was able to become human. Again.

75
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,007
Much to his wife's dismay.

76
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:06,044
So where is he now?

77
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:07,917
He went back to
Brakebills South?

78
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:10,719
MARGO: I mean, why?
Brakebills isn't using it.

79
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,751
There's not enough magic
for the geese to make it.

80
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,189
I found that out the hard way.

81
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:17,094
Rest in peace, first years.

82
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:20,498
So, I guess we have to go down
there and talk to Mayakovsky?

83
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:21,728
Sounds like a plan.

84
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:24,067
You two have fun
talking to that old drunk.

85
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:26,029
No.

86
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,473
Wait. Margo, Margo, hey.
I just... I... There's, um...

87
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:33,480
Things are still kinda weird
between me and Alice, and I just...

88
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,192
Mmm-hmm, and I'm still rinsing
desert sand out of my twat, all right?

If it makes you feel any better,

97
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,877
I don't wanna be alone with
you, either. I never said that.

98
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:07,278
Yes, you did. I heard
you say that to Margo.

99
00:04:07,514 --> 00:04:10,313
Let's just not start
by lying to each other.

100
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:11,594
Okay. Look, I don't
want to be here,

101
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,362
but we're here, so
let's just get it over with.

111
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:50,515
ALICE: Mayakovsky
did this to himself.

112
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,082
He designed a spell to swap
his present consciousness

113
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,890
with one from a different time.

114
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,520
He called it a timeshare spell.

Not mentally, no.

118
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:04,867
Based on these notes
and his current state,

119
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:07,703
I think he's from
the future, where...

120
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:10,175
Mayakovsky has dementia.

121
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:13,938
Great. (SIGHS) Well,
it was an accident.

122
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:16,108
He inverted two of the
numbers in the spell.

123
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:17,742
(SIGHS) So, how do we undo it?

124
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,218
He's the only one who can.

125
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:21,330
I don't think we can
help him, Quentin.

126
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:22,982
We may have hit a dead end.

00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:15,167
It's good to see you smiling.

356
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:16,801
Been worried about you.

357
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,334
You seem distant lately.

358
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,868
I wondered if something
had happened.

359
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:25,340
If anything were
wrong, I'd tell you.

360
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,811
You would.

361
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,405
Well, I'm here for you.
You know that, right?

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

363
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:35,077
Yes?

364
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:39,325
Sorry to interrupt, but
there has been an incident.

365
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,758
It's Fogg.

366
00:17:43,195 --> 00:17:45,187
Perhaps it's time for
someone to talk to him

367
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:47,699
who isn't a friend. Of course.

368
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:51,237

JULIA: I thought
she came in here.

00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,721

Margo?

382
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:39,850
Some weird-ass ghost
shoved me in a closet.

383
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,387
Yeah.

I'm here because you
changed my life, Penny.

doubt that. Oh, my.

You sound just like
P-40 right now. Whoa.

So, I left Brakebills to
find out what happened.

403
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:50,782

this plot was a mess.

would sip a little giggle water

and get a wiggle on,
but instead we're just...

You mean all this insane
shit that is happening

423
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,434
is to get me and
Julia to hook up?

I mean after that little
naked interlude in Fillory...

425
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:50,040
You watched that? Yeah.

see it, buster, and you're it.

the pages from the Binder,

we need them back. Now.

but you just gotta understand I
see what you and Julia keep doing

the both of you.

own joy to help others.

that power, and you...

died because of it.

Yeah, when I think
about it, it's a sad twist.

the two of you to be happy,

never do it for yourself.

A nursery rhyme.

I've been trying to
remember it all day.

468
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:41,994
We used to sing it
while playing Bearskip.

469
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:44,656
It's a children's game, sort
of like Fillorian hopscotch.

470
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,495
Involving bears?
Ideally skipping them.

471
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:50,468
"He hides his drink from
his many daughters."

472
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,266
"Builds a cistern to
hoard the waters."

473

"Underneath the castle fair."

474
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:56,338
BOTH: "If you jump,
you'll skip the bear!"

475
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:57,603
Okay.

476
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,474
Your nursery rhyme
used the word "cistern"?

477
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:00,889
Well, how else are
children supposed to learn

478
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:02,848

containment systems?

You people are sick. Wait.

480
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:08,544
He built underground
water containment systems?

481
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:11,523
Ismenie, you said, "The
Waters, they are moving."

482
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,252
But were you really
talking about water?

483
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,453
She's always
talking about water.

484
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:17,155
Unless she's
talking about magic.

485
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,994
A huge reservoir of magic,
hidden underneath the castle.

486
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,265
That could be what's causing
all the stuff we're seeing.

487
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:24,634
Wait, wait. (SIGHS)

Why do you suddenly
need to know this?

494
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:41,380
Uh, it's just something that
I've been wondering about.

495
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:42,580
You're serious?

496
00:23:42,688 --> 00:23:47,558
You could be having fox sex with
your partner, the better Magician.

497
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,226
I realize that.

498
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:52,026
She could do incorporate bond.

499
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,701
And she's chosen to have
sex with you for some reason.

500
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:59,671
You should be having as
much sex with her as you can

501
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:01,206
before she realizes.

that you are an expert in.

Oh, little pushback
from B-minus student.

506
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:16,381
there is something that
you are an actual expert in

507
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,391
that I need to
know about. Right.

508
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,917
You "need" to know how
to cast an incorporate bond.

00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:31,103
Your discipline,
B-minus student,

512
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:33,469
or did you leave that
back in your tiny fox pants?

513
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,108
They tested me.

00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:40,407
Well, that is a problem.

00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:44,746
Can't cast incorporate
bond without your discipline.

517
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,581
There's got to be some
kind of workaround.

518
00:24:46,652 --> 00:24:47,652
Nope.

519
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,082
Come back when
you're fully formed.

520
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,900
Come on. There's got to be
something that you can do.

521
00:24:51,924 --> 00:24:52,924
I need this.

522
00:24:56,295 --> 00:24:58,230
Fine. Drink that.

523
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,960
This will help
with the test or...

524
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:05,664
It will kill brain cells. I
have plenty to spare.

525
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:07,934
You don't, but...

began in a place

654
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:18,788
known simply as

655
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:21,289
the Library.

656
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,600
You were a Librarian?

657
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,136
He did say it
started in the Library.

658
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:26,363
I mean, it's fucking obvious.

659
00:33:26,438 --> 00:33:28,373
He was studying

660
00:33:28,907 --> 00:33:30,341
the limits of power.

661
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:36,940
His specialty was the
magic inherent in gods.

662
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,543
PENNY 23: Great. A puppet show.

663
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:41,996
THE BINDER: The
Binder had a theory.

664
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,184
When a being of great
power, such as a god, is killed,

665
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:50,119
their energy is lost, but he
believed it could be preserved

666
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:51,754
by binding it to an object.

667
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,696
That object, in
turn, could be bound

668
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:56,599
to a Magician of sufficient
training and preparation,

669
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:59,331
effectively turning the
Magician into a god.

670
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:02,101
Yeah, but every time a
mortal tries to kill a god,

671
00:34:02,173 --> 00:34:04,039
all magic gets shut off.

672
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:07,969
The Binder politely
reminded Margo that

673
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,776
not every story was about her.

674
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:12,977
So the Binder is a catty bitch?

675
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,051
(GROANS)

676
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:16,920
He continued.

677
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,954
It was a problem that perplexed

678
00:34:21,026 --> 00:34:23,359
the Binder and his
fellow Librarians,

679
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:26,159
but, as it turned out,

680
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:30,601
the old gods themselves
provided a solution.

681
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:35,239
Two siblings. Mistakes.

682
00:34:35,874 --> 00:34:38,343
Born with the
power of many gods.

683
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:41,141
They were created
with one unique quality

684
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:43,374
that made them essential
to this experiment.

685
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:46,451
They could not die.

686
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:50,097
So no matter what you did
to them, it wouldn't trigger

687
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:51,885
the old gods to take away magic.

688
00:34:51,957 --> 00:34:54,449
Without fear of the
old gods' retribution,

689
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:59,123
The Librarians were safe to
move forward with their experiment.

690
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:00,665
One of the Monsters
was captured,

691
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:03,065
the older, more
dominant one. The female.

692
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:04,158
Natch.

693
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:06,170
The one left behind
would be confused,

694
00:35:06,738 --> 00:35:08,764
afraid, like a child.

695
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:13,069
Without his sister, he'd have
trouble even remembering them.

696
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:15,145
What did you do to the sister?

697
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:21,881
She was split into four parts.

698
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,445
Each part bound in a stone.

699
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:29,085
Each stone bound in a Librarian.

700
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:33,461
Bacchus. Iris. Heka. Aengus.

701
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:35,925
Those ballsacks.

702
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:37,792
When they were finished,

703
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:41,001
the Binder came to
regret what he had done.

704
00:35:43,408 --> 00:35:47,140
But the new gods he had

705
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:51,515
He alone held the secret that
could make them human again.

706
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:52,676
And so...

707
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:55,951

JULIA: They turned
you into a book.

709

Okay. That does kind of
suck. (THE BINDER SIGHS)

710
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:05,993
In that form, he became
something they could control.

Hide from the rest of
The Order, from history.

712
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:15,167
It was only by chance that a
young Librarian read his book

713
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,936
and was convinced

714
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,204
to hide the Binder
in the Mirror World,

715
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:21,143
where he hoped no
one would find him again.

716
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:24,910
Until word reached the
Binder of Julia Wicker,

717
00:36:24,983 --> 00:36:26,952
and her quest.

718
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,715
He knew he had the
answers she sought.

719
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:33,154
So you can help me
become a goddess again?

720
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:35,284
He could take her
in either direction.

721
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,353
The godhood, or humanity.

722
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:40,532
The choice was hers.

723
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:43,129
Either road would be painful.

724
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,638
He wondered aloud
if she was ready.

725
00:36:47,072 --> 00:36:48,472
You and me both.

726
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:52,238
The Binder knew she needed
time to consider which way to go.

727
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:53,901
But either way,

728
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:58,876
he'd need a favor in return.

729
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,688
He needed her to burn his book.

730
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,589
He did not want
to be used again.

731
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:15,165

739
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,584

To do what?

741
00:38:12,557 --> 00:38:13,581
To become a god.

742
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:18,028
And if this book is correct,

743
00:38:19,264 --> 00:38:20,264
he succeeds.

be a coincidence.

Oh, no. Don't get me, bear!

Because you successfully
"skipped the bear,"

you get to throw the sweetberry.
