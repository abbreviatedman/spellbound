1
00:00:06,441 --> 00:00:09,357
Previously
on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,185
Everett's trying
to squeeze out hedges.

3
00:00:11,228 --> 00:00:13,143
This is just more of the same.

4
00:00:16,886 --> 00:00:18,844
We're here to study
with Mayakovsky.

5
00:00:18,888 --> 00:00:21,064
We hear he's crazy.
- You heard wrong!

6
00:00:21,108 --> 00:00:22,326
- So wait.

7
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,807
So you turned Mayakovsky
into a bear?

8
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,765
- I can help.

9
00:00:26,809 --> 00:00:28,724
Just let me stay.

10
00:00:28,767 --> 00:00:32,075
You saved my life. You can-
you can save my life 50 times.

11
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:36,253
It's not gonna change
anything between us.

12
00:00:36,297 --> 00:00:38,299
Good-bye, Alice.

13
00:00:38,342 --> 00:00:39,865
- The Poison Room-

14
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:41,867
It's where we store books
too dangerous for the public.

15
00:00:41,911 --> 00:00:43,652
- You must seek the binder.

16
00:00:43,695 --> 00:00:45,784
This was
in the Mirror World.

17
00:00:45,828 --> 00:00:48,918
And I heard you were looking
for the binder, so...

18
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:50,528
- Holy shit.

19
00:00:50,572 --> 00:00:52,400
- Foremost saved them

20
00:00:52,443 --> 00:00:54,663
with special weapons
that expel possession.

21
00:00:54,706 --> 00:00:56,273
They call them ice axes,

22
00:00:56,317 --> 00:00:57,883
and I'm assuming
that's poetic license.

23
00:00:57,927 --> 00:01:00,103
So we might have a chance
to save Eliot.

24
00:01:00,973 --> 00:01:04,107
But Hot and Dumb
just wasn't getting it.

25
00:01:04,151 --> 00:01:06,457
And that's when I told
the Foreskin,

26
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:08,590
"Welcome
to the New Desert Order.

27
00:01:08,633 --> 00:01:10,635
It's gonna suck for you."

28
00:01:10,679 --> 00:01:13,116
Wow. You really went through
a lot to get those axes.

29
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,813
- Call them by their names...

30
00:01:14,857 --> 00:01:16,772
Sorrow...

31
00:01:16,815 --> 00:01:18,817
and Sorrow.
- Nice.

32
00:01:18,861 --> 00:01:20,645
Where'd you get
the axes from?

33
00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:22,473
Fine.

34
00:01:22,517 --> 00:01:24,780
I'll tell it one more time.

35
00:01:24,823 --> 00:01:27,304
So I'm all, "Welcome
to the New Desert Order."

36
00:01:27,348 --> 00:01:29,263
"Gonna suck for you."

37
00:01:29,306 --> 00:01:30,829
- What's gonna suck?

38
00:01:30,873 --> 00:01:33,310
Telling this story
over again.

39
00:01:33,354 --> 00:01:35,443
And so I was like,

40
00:01:35,486 --> 00:01:37,314
"Welcome
to the New Desert Order.

41
00:01:37,358 --> 00:01:38,750
Gonna suck for you."

42
00:01:38,794 --> 00:01:41,492
What did I miss?
- I'm getting a smoothie.

43
00:01:41,536 --> 00:01:44,930
You fuckers take this.

44
00:01:44,974 --> 00:01:47,150
Seriously, you spent
that much time in the desert,

45
00:01:47,194 --> 00:01:48,673
and this never occurred
to you?

46
00:01:48,717 --> 00:01:51,328
We're dealing
with God-level monsters.

47
00:01:51,372 --> 00:01:53,330
- Who possess people.

48
00:01:53,374 --> 00:01:55,376
Those axes
pull the spirits out,

49
00:01:55,419 --> 00:01:56,986
and then we bottle them up.
Bam!

50
00:01:57,029 --> 00:01:58,509
FTW.

51
00:01:58,553 --> 00:02:00,903
All he's saying
is they're too powerful.

52
00:02:00,946 --> 00:02:02,905
I doubt your bottles
can hold that shit.

53
00:02:02,948 --> 00:02:04,863
Those monsters
are coming for us.

54
00:02:04,907 --> 00:02:06,213
Make it work.

55
00:02:06,256 --> 00:02:07,736
- Okay, but how?

56
00:02:07,779 --> 00:02:10,347
We could cast an incorporate
bond on the bottles.

57
00:02:10,391 --> 00:02:11,827
- Thank you.

58
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,569
I don't know what that is,
but I hate you less now.

59
00:02:14,612 --> 00:02:17,354
It's a way to pin a being
or object in place.

60
00:02:17,398 --> 00:02:19,400
It's like a fourth-dimensional
paperweight.

61
00:02:19,443 --> 00:02:22,533
Mayakovsky was trapped
under one for years.

62
00:02:22,577 --> 00:02:24,535
We just need
to pin the monsters

63
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:26,885
to your bottles long enough
to get rid of them.

64
00:02:26,929 --> 00:02:30,193
Great.
Let's do that shit, then.

65
00:02:30,237 --> 00:02:33,283
So who knows how to cast
an incorporate bond?

66
00:02:33,327 --> 00:02:35,851
I did cast an incorporate
bond on Mayakovsky,

67
00:02:35,894 --> 00:02:38,723
but I didn't write
the spell myself.

68
00:02:38,767 --> 00:02:40,029
- So who wrote it?

69
00:02:40,072 --> 00:02:41,726
- Mayakovsky did.

70
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,772
He didn't know
I was going to use it on him.

71
00:02:43,815 --> 00:02:46,557
He was the only person capable
of writing a spell

72
00:02:46,601 --> 00:02:47,993
which he couldn't break.

73
00:02:48,037 --> 00:02:49,908
He knows more things
about incorporate bonds

74
00:02:49,952 --> 00:02:51,475
than anyone else does.

75
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,218
You wanted a spell
to trap a god, yes?

76
00:02:55,262 --> 00:02:58,221
Well...
he's the real expert.

77
00:02:58,265 --> 00:03:01,050
But he's also a bear.
- Not exactly.

78
00:03:01,093 --> 00:03:05,750
You see, once magic came back,
he was able to become human.

79
00:03:05,794 --> 00:03:09,058
Again...much
to his wife's dismay.

80
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:10,973
- So where is he now?

81
00:03:11,016 --> 00:03:12,931
He went back
to Brakebills South?

82
00:03:12,975 --> 00:03:15,586
I mean, why?
- Brakebills isn't using it.

83
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,415
There's not enough magic
for the geese to make it.

84
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:19,982
I found that out
the hard way.

85
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:21,940
Rest in peace,
First Years.

86
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:25,422
So I guess we have to go down
there and talk to Mayakovsky?

87
00:03:25,466 --> 00:03:26,815
- Sounds like a plan.

88
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:29,948
You two have fun
talking to that old drunk.

89
00:03:29,992 --> 00:03:31,602
- No.

90
00:03:31,646 --> 00:03:33,778
Wait. Margo, Margo, hey.

91
00:03:33,822 --> 00:03:35,432
I just-I-There's, um-

92
00:03:35,476 --> 00:03:37,434
Things are still complicated
between me and Alice,

93
00:03:37,478 --> 00:03:39,306
and I-and I just thought.
- Mm-hmm.

94
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:41,003
And I'm still rinsing desert
sand out of my twat, all right?

95
00:03:41,046 --> 00:03:43,440
I'm not going
to fucking Antarctica.

96
00:03:43,484 --> 00:03:45,877
Grow a pair
of tits, Coldwater.

97
00:03:53,494 --> 00:03:54,799
- Jesus, it's cold.

98
00:03:54,843 --> 00:03:57,498
- I forgot my scarf, so...

99
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,282
good luck with that.

100
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:07,116
If it makes you feel
any better,

101
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:08,596
I don't want to be
alone with you either.

102
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,424
I never said that.
- Yes, you did.

103
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:12,687
I heard you say that to Margo.

104
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,080
Let's just not start
by lying to each other.

105
00:04:15,124 --> 00:04:16,821
Okay, look, I don't want
to be here, but we're here,

106
00:04:16,865 --> 00:04:18,388
so let's just
get it over with.

107
00:04:18,432 --> 00:04:19,868
- Quentin.

108
00:04:21,522 --> 00:04:23,654
Shit.

109
00:04:23,698 --> 00:04:25,003
- Oh.

110
00:04:25,047 --> 00:04:27,658
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Professor...

111
00:04:27,702 --> 00:04:29,660
Mayakovsky.

112
00:04:34,578 --> 00:04:36,363
- Professor?

113
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,686
Mayakovsky
did this to himself.

114
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,862
He designed a spell to swap
his present consciousness

115
00:04:57,906 --> 00:04:59,690
with one
from a different time.

116
00:04:59,734 --> 00:05:01,518
He called it
a timeshare spell.

117
00:05:02,911 --> 00:05:05,174
So that's not
our Mayakovsky.

118
00:05:05,217 --> 00:05:07,045
- Not mentally, no.

119
00:05:07,089 --> 00:05:09,874
Based on these notes
and-and his current state,

120
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:12,703
I think he's
from the future, where...

121
00:05:12,747 --> 00:05:15,837
Mayakovsky has dementia.

122
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,970
Great.
- Well, it was an accident.

123
00:05:19,014 --> 00:05:21,146
He inverted two of the numbers
in the spell.

124
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:22,757
So how do we undo it?

125
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,759
He's the only one
who can.

126
00:05:24,802 --> 00:05:26,500
I don't think
we can help him, Quentin.

127
00:05:26,543 --> 00:05:29,067
We may have hit
a dead end.

128
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:32,114
Unless I talk
to him in the past.

129
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,598
You wanna steal
Everett's book

130
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:39,034
from the Poison Room?

131
00:05:39,077 --> 00:05:40,862
It's the only way
we can get ahead of him,

132
00:05:40,905 --> 00:05:44,082
but I need your help.

133
00:05:44,126 --> 00:05:47,085
Um, Penny died
'cause of going in there,

134
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:48,609
so, no.

135
00:05:48,652 --> 00:05:50,915
I can get us
in and out unharmed,

136
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,569
but protocol dictates

137
00:05:52,613 --> 00:05:55,093
Librarians enter
the Poison Room in pairs...

138
00:05:55,137 --> 00:05:56,704
for safety.

139
00:05:56,747 --> 00:05:58,053
- Fogg can do it.

140
00:05:58,096 --> 00:06:00,751
Unfortunately,
I cannot leave Brakebills.

141
00:06:00,795 --> 00:06:03,885
The Library
has been up my ass.

142
00:06:03,928 --> 00:06:07,410
They're even threatening to put
monitors in all my classrooms.

143
00:06:07,454 --> 00:06:09,760
Henry has a point.
It would draw undue attention.

144
00:06:09,804 --> 00:06:11,936
Oh, to the fact
that he's a fucking coward?

145
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,765
You don't get to be
a magician my age, dear,

146
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:18,421
without a very healthy sense
of self-preservation.

147
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,424
- Kady...

148
00:06:22,469 --> 00:06:23,992
Please.

149
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:29,214
I mean, if this is
a real language,

150
00:06:29,258 --> 00:06:31,608
it is a dead one that nobody's
ever written about.

151
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:34,611
Well, maybe it's not
a language. Maybe it's...

152
00:06:34,655 --> 00:06:38,528
Ow. Goddamn paper cut.

153
00:06:40,182 --> 00:06:42,750
Cocksucking book bit me.

154
00:06:42,793 --> 00:06:44,621
It did!

155
00:06:47,494 --> 00:06:50,540
Why is this book
suddenly blank?

156
00:06:50,584 --> 00:06:51,846
- Hey, wait a minute.

157
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:54,065
Is that writing there?

158
00:06:54,109 --> 00:06:55,850
I can barely make it out.

159
00:06:55,893 --> 00:06:58,766
My God. I think it's written
in Margo's blood.

160
00:06:58,809 --> 00:07:01,638
It wants blood,
I got blood.

161
00:07:01,682 --> 00:07:03,684
BRB.

162
00:07:07,601 --> 00:07:09,994
Is that...?
- Yep.

163
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:13,694
It's shark week.
You can thank my uterus later.

164
00:07:13,737 --> 00:07:15,696
- This is in Latin.

165
00:07:15,739 --> 00:07:17,654
I can't cast.

166
00:07:17,698 --> 00:07:19,482
Um, you better have
a look at it.

167
00:07:19,526 --> 00:07:20,875
- Oh.

168
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:22,267
- Oh, come on.

169
00:08:09,706 --> 00:08:11,665
And the Binder
stood before them,

170
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:16,234
and as they stared,
eyes full of wonder,

171
00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:18,802
the Binder
thought to himself...

172
00:08:20,978 --> 00:08:23,285
"Took you long enough."

173
00:08:31,728 --> 00:08:34,122
He's in there?
- Yes.

174
00:08:34,165 --> 00:08:35,993
And he's
at an acquisitions meeting,

175
00:08:36,037 --> 00:08:37,517
which should give us
enough time to copy it.

176
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,649
Okay, thanks.
Check back with me later.

177
00:08:39,693 --> 00:08:42,304
Everett.
- Zelda.

178
00:08:42,347 --> 00:08:45,176
How was the meeting?
- Detailed.

179
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,482
I snuck out.

180
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,006
What are you doing here?

181
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,182
I was hoping
we could talk...

182
00:08:51,226 --> 00:08:53,663
in your office, perhaps.

183
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:55,360
- Of course.

184
00:08:58,712 --> 00:09:01,236
The Binder knew Julia
had many questions.

185
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,020
She'd been searching in vain

186
00:09:03,064 --> 00:09:05,632
for how to reacquire
her divinity.

187
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:07,329
He knew the answer.

188
00:09:07,372 --> 00:09:08,678
- Hey, what's with all

189
00:09:08,722 --> 00:09:10,637
the third-person,
past-tense bullshit?

190
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,379
The Binder had no idea
what she was talking about.

191
00:09:14,423 --> 00:09:15,772
Huh.

192
00:09:15,816 --> 00:09:20,560
The Binder explained...
he had answers,

193
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:25,390
but it would require they learn
how he came to be..

194
00:09:25,434 --> 00:09:29,743
to be...

195
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,052
The Binder felt dizzy.

196
00:09:35,096 --> 00:09:37,577
His book was a...

197
00:09:39,274 --> 00:09:41,581
Oh, it was somehow...

198
00:09:41,624 --> 00:09:44,714
it was somehow...

199
00:09:44,758 --> 00:09:47,369
missing pages.

200
00:09:47,412 --> 00:09:49,763
- I think he's broken.

201
00:09:51,678 --> 00:09:53,593
The fuck.

202
00:09:55,464 --> 00:09:57,727
When did this happen?
- I don't know.

203
00:09:57,771 --> 00:10:01,252
He was talking normal
a second ago.

204
00:10:01,296 --> 00:10:03,820
Normal for him.
My God.

205
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,444
- What the hell?

206
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:31,108
- Fen, Tick?

207
00:10:31,152 --> 00:10:33,110
Guys, the weirdest thing
just happened.

208
00:10:33,154 --> 00:10:35,199
I was eating a biscuit,
not off the floor,

209
00:10:35,243 --> 00:10:37,114
and I had a kind of vision.

210
00:10:37,158 --> 00:10:38,463
Still good.

211
00:10:42,816 --> 00:10:44,426
- Last looks.

212
00:10:44,469 --> 00:10:46,123
"Eating Out
with Josh Hoberman,"

213
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:48,299
scene one, take one-
marker.

214
00:10:48,343 --> 00:10:50,562
- I'm eating what?

215
00:10:50,606 --> 00:10:53,304
But no one in Fillory has a TV

216
00:10:53,348 --> 00:10:56,307
so why...
am I questioning this?

217
00:10:56,351 --> 00:10:57,787
Action!

218
00:10:57,831 --> 00:11:00,485
Any baker worth their gluten
knows a biscuit

219
00:11:00,529 --> 00:11:02,270
is only as good as its flour.

220
00:11:02,313 --> 00:11:04,794
Add a drizzle of
lavender-infused honey,

221
00:11:04,838 --> 00:11:08,493
and trust me, you'd eat this
right off the floor.

222
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,763
- The Winds of Fate-

223
00:11:16,806 --> 00:11:18,721
they've come unseasonably early
this year.

224
00:11:18,765 --> 00:11:20,680
I think this is a sign
that Fillory's in trouble.

225
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:23,813
Early Winds of Fate, Lorian
plants silencing the animals,

226
00:11:23,857 --> 00:11:25,510
too many questing creatures...

227
00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:27,512
Seriously, it sounds
like Fillory's ecosystem

228
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:29,689
is completely jacked
and not in a sexy way.

229
00:11:29,732 --> 00:11:31,342
Interesting
you should say that.

230
00:11:31,386 --> 00:11:33,518
Not long ago,
we imprisoned a Naiad

231
00:11:33,562 --> 00:11:36,173
for committing moderate acts of
violence against some farmers.

232
00:11:36,217 --> 00:11:38,480
- She deboned one of them.

233
00:11:38,523 --> 00:11:41,309
Really great knife skills.
- Jesus.

234
00:11:41,352 --> 00:11:43,267
Anyway,
I recall her saying something

235
00:11:43,311 --> 00:11:44,834
about Fillory's
failing ecosystem,

236
00:11:44,878 --> 00:11:46,662
but she was covered in guts,
and that's really hard

237
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,316
to get past.
- Been there.

238
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:50,187
Get that.
- Let's talk to her.

239
00:11:51,406 --> 00:11:53,190
- Okay.

240
00:11:53,234 --> 00:11:54,670
Hello, Ismenie.

241
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,238
I brought you
some visitors today.

242
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:01,372
- Oh! God!

243
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:02,678
Am I the only one getting

244
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:04,375
"The Ring"/"Grudge"-type
vibes here?

245
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:05,550
- She's a Naiad.

246
00:12:05,594 --> 00:12:08,553
Why do you
dry-skins torture me?

247
00:12:08,597 --> 00:12:10,817
I came to you with a warning.

248
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,820
Yes, yes, you also attacked
several farmers.

249
00:12:13,863 --> 00:12:15,778
- That was my warning.

250
00:12:15,822 --> 00:12:19,216
They were stealing my water-
an assault on my very soul.

251
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,001
- She protects a well.

252
00:12:21,044 --> 00:12:23,568
What if your blood lived
outside of your skin

253
00:12:23,612 --> 00:12:26,310
and thoughtless things drank
it, bathed in it, peed in it?

254
00:12:26,354 --> 00:12:29,574
Yes, well, I'm afraid we have
a few question we need to ask

255
00:12:29,618 --> 00:12:31,751
about Fillory's ecosystem.

256
00:12:31,794 --> 00:12:34,579
I told you all before,
it is The Waters.

257
00:12:34,623 --> 00:12:36,581
They are moving.

258
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,583
It is the fault
of the Thirteenth.

259
00:12:38,627 --> 00:12:40,585
- The Thirteenth?

260
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:42,544
- The thirsty Thirteenth.

261
00:12:42,587 --> 00:12:46,417
He tried to capture us,
dam us in.

262
00:12:46,461 --> 00:12:48,506
Water should flow free.

263
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,031
What he built-
there is no excuse for it.

264
00:12:51,074 --> 00:12:53,424
- What did he build?

265
00:12:53,468 --> 00:12:54,904
- We're done here, dry-skins.

266
00:12:54,948 --> 00:12:56,688
- No, we are not done here!

267
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:03,478
- Once you're there,

268
00:13:03,521 --> 00:13:05,915
you can't do anything or say
anything to anyone that'll-

269
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:07,308
- Risk changing the past.

270
00:13:07,351 --> 00:13:09,919
I get it.
I've been to the movies.

271
00:13:09,963 --> 00:13:11,791
- This is serious, Quentin.

272
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:13,531
The bridge
between your past self

273
00:13:13,575 --> 00:13:15,882
and your present self is-
is delicate. If you break it-

274
00:13:15,925 --> 00:13:18,406
Look, as long as you wipe
past me's memory,

275
00:13:18,449 --> 00:13:19,624
we'll be fine.

276
00:13:19,668 --> 00:13:22,584
I have a Memory Charm
ready to go.

277
00:13:25,717 --> 00:13:27,937
We'll set the spell
so it takes you back

278
00:13:27,981 --> 00:13:29,809
to where we were
at Brakebills South.

279
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:31,898
Just go straight
to Mayakovsky's office

280
00:13:31,941 --> 00:13:34,814
and don't talk to anyone.
- I won't.

281
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:53,876
Alice?
How did I get up here?

282
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:06,976
Alice, I-

283
00:14:08,717 --> 00:14:11,546
Oh, um...

284
00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:13,461
Oh, God. Alice...

285
00:14:13,504 --> 00:14:14,984
- Mm.

286
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,078
Mm-mm.
Alice, wait.

287
00:14:22,122 --> 00:14:23,427
No, I just have to-

288
00:14:23,471 --> 00:14:25,777
What's wrong?
- No, no, no. It's fine.

289
00:14:25,821 --> 00:14:27,997
Mm-mm.
No, I just-

290
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,390
I got to-

291
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:30,913
- What did I do?

292
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:33,133
Oh, you? No, no, it's me.
I'm the problem.

293
00:14:33,176 --> 00:14:35,396
I, um...

294
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:37,572
Just-I forgot condoms.

295
00:14:37,615 --> 00:14:39,922
So I'm just gonna...

296
00:14:46,973 --> 00:14:49,323
What am I doing
on the table?

297
00:14:51,107 --> 00:14:53,109
- Just stand still.

298
00:14:53,153 --> 00:14:55,546
Whose clothes
am I wearing?

299
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:58,114
- Shit, there's no more magic.

300
00:14:58,158 --> 00:15:01,465
Alice, what's going on?
How did we get here?

301
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:04,947
Uh, I heard that...
sometimes Mayakovsky

302
00:15:04,991 --> 00:15:07,341
randomly teleports students
to the lab for testing

303
00:15:07,384 --> 00:15:10,474
to keep us on our toes.

304
00:15:10,518 --> 00:15:13,260
Uh...okay,
I hadn't heard that, but-

305
00:15:13,303 --> 00:15:15,958
No, no, it's a real thing
that he does.

306
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:20,006
Uh, look, there must be
some sort of test.

307
00:15:21,181 --> 00:15:22,965
Um...

308
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:24,271
Knots.

309
00:15:24,314 --> 00:15:26,316
Yeah, we-we need
to tie these into knots

310
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,971
for magic purposes,
like, for sure.

311
00:15:29,015 --> 00:15:31,582
All right, I guess
that could be worse.

312
00:15:47,903 --> 00:15:51,385
- Yes?

313
00:15:57,043 --> 00:15:58,870
Hello?

314
00:15:58,914 --> 00:16:01,351
Oh, thank Christ.
I didn't think I'd get through.

315
00:16:01,395 --> 00:16:04,224
The phones here work off of
GPS coordinates, not numbers.

316
00:16:04,267 --> 00:16:06,443
- Well, you were close.

317
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:09,011
Listen,
I don't have a lot of time.

318
00:16:09,055 --> 00:16:11,927
We need your help.

319
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,190
Surviving
first-year students...

320
00:16:18,064 --> 00:16:19,587
I'm here...

321
00:16:22,242 --> 00:16:24,548
To teach you...

322
00:16:24,592 --> 00:16:26,507
what not to do.

323
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:28,596
Let's begin...

324
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,207
with a cloaking spell,
shall we?

325
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:35,559
Which, unfortunately,
you will never do...

326
00:16:35,603 --> 00:16:38,606
because...
The Library,

327
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:40,912
they don't want you to know it.

328
00:16:49,225 --> 00:16:51,227
Did you see that?

329
00:16:51,271 --> 00:16:53,577
Now forget it,
because if you learn it,

330
00:16:53,621 --> 00:16:56,189
you'll be in very,
very serious trouble.

331
00:16:56,232 --> 00:16:57,581
Damn it!

332
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,409
Good God!

333
00:16:59,453 --> 00:17:02,369
Cock shit!

334
00:17:02,412 --> 00:17:06,460
Surely you didn't come here
just to gossip about Phyllis.

335
00:17:06,503 --> 00:17:08,592
You don't think her perfumes
are a danger to the books?

336
00:17:08,636 --> 00:17:12,422
I think she smokes and
doesn't want anyone to know.

337
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:15,425
But we all do.

338
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:18,080
It's good to see you smiling.

339
00:17:18,124 --> 00:17:20,256
Been worried about you.

340
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,084
You seem distant lately.

341
00:17:22,128 --> 00:17:24,652
I wondered
if something had happened.

342
00:17:24,695 --> 00:17:28,090
If anything were wrong,
I'd tell you.

343
00:17:28,134 --> 00:17:29,570
- You would.

344
00:17:29,613 --> 00:17:32,138
Well, I'm here for you.
You know that, right?

345
00:17:36,316 --> 00:17:38,100
Yes?

346
00:17:38,144 --> 00:17:42,104
Sorry to interrupt,
but there has been an incident.

347
00:17:42,148 --> 00:17:45,238
It's Fogg.

348
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:47,979
Perhaps it's time
for someone to talk to him

349
00:17:48,023 --> 00:17:50,460
who isn't a friend.
- Of course.

350
00:17:52,506 --> 00:17:55,117
Thank you for the tea.
- Mm-hmm.

351
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,092
Where the hell
did Margo go?

352
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:15,311
- I thought she came in here.

353
00:18:15,355 --> 00:18:18,053
What's with
the honeymoon suite?

354
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:23,711
Huh. That was, uh...

355
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:28,759
You didn't do that,
did you?

356
00:18:28,803 --> 00:18:30,631
- I can't do that.

357
00:18:30,674 --> 00:18:34,200
- Okay, seriously?

358
00:18:34,243 --> 00:18:37,420
- Margo?

359
00:18:37,464 --> 00:18:39,161
Margo?
- Aah!

360
00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:42,599
Some weird-ass ghost
shoved me in a closet.

361
00:18:42,643 --> 00:18:44,166
Yeah.

362
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:47,343
I can see your non-corporeal
panty-sniffing ass

363
00:18:47,387 --> 00:18:49,693
with my goddamn fairy eye.

364
00:18:49,737 --> 00:18:52,522
Ghost?
- Or whatevs.

365
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:55,699
He keeps shaking his head.

366
00:18:55,743 --> 00:18:57,701
I can't hear you.

367
00:18:57,745 --> 00:19:00,530
Keeps pointing at you
for some reason.

368
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,193
- Penny 23.

369
00:19:11,237 --> 00:19:14,588
Isn't this just berries?

370
00:19:20,811 --> 00:19:24,075
I'm here because you changed
my life, Penny.

371
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:29,385
I mean, not you, Penny 40.
But basically you.

372
00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:33,607
When he died/became
my astral best friend-

373
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,870
Yeah, I seriously doubt that.
- Oh, my.

374
00:19:35,913 --> 00:19:39,569
You sound just like P-40
right now. Whoa.

375
00:19:39,613 --> 00:19:41,484
Can we get to the part
where you explain

376
00:19:41,528 --> 00:19:43,094
why you're here, please.
- Welp.

377
00:19:43,138 --> 00:19:44,661
You guys are
my favorite characters.

378
00:19:44,705 --> 00:19:46,620
Only you disappeared.

379
00:19:46,663 --> 00:19:48,926
So I left Brakebills
to find out what happened.

380
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:52,843
And when I did, hoo-boy,
this plot was a mess.

381
00:19:52,887 --> 00:19:54,758
- You mean my life?

382
00:19:54,802 --> 00:19:57,544
I'm done watching.

383
00:19:57,587 --> 00:20:00,024
I want to participate.

384
00:20:00,068 --> 00:20:02,679
And you-the other you-

385
00:20:02,723 --> 00:20:05,900
great twist-showed me
how to do that.

386
00:20:05,943 --> 00:20:08,859
Turns out I can be stuff

387
00:20:08,903 --> 00:20:11,514
at a level
I never imagined possible.

388
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:14,952
Is that why Margo is tied up
in the closet and...

389
00:20:14,996 --> 00:20:18,391
you're lighting candles,
playing sexy music?

390
00:20:19,914 --> 00:20:21,829
Patience, Kemo Sabe.

391
00:20:21,872 --> 00:20:24,048
I'll get there.

392
00:20:24,092 --> 00:20:25,746
- Yeah, that's offensive.

393
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:27,965
But I thought
you were Indian?

394
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:29,880
What?
- Anyhootch, I had a thought.

395
00:20:29,924 --> 00:20:34,058
I-I mean, in my day, you two
would sip a little giggle water

396
00:20:34,102 --> 00:20:39,150
and get a wiggle on,
but instead we're just...

397
00:20:39,194 --> 00:20:42,415
waiting.
Yawn.

398
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,113
You mean all this insane shit
that is happening

399
00:20:45,156 --> 00:20:47,463
is to get me and Julia
to hook up?

400
00:20:47,507 --> 00:20:50,074
I mean after that little
naked interlude in Fillory-

401
00:20:50,118 --> 00:20:51,815
You watched that?
- Yeah.

402
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:54,165
I know a true thing when I see
it, buster, and you're it.

403
00:20:54,209 --> 00:20:57,995
Listen, Hyman, if you stole
the pages from the Binder

404
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:00,955
we need them back.
Now.

405
00:21:00,998 --> 00:21:04,567
Or I will sick Margo on you.

406
00:21:04,611 --> 00:21:06,743
- Maybe I overstepped, but...

407
00:21:06,787 --> 00:21:11,444
you just gotta understand I see
what you and Julia keep doing

408
00:21:11,487 --> 00:21:13,924
and I worry
about the both of you.

409
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:16,797
- What are we doing?

410
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:21,584
You both sacrifice
your own joy to help others.

411
00:21:21,628 --> 00:21:25,284
Julia gave up all that power,
and you...

412
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:28,591
I mean other Penny died
because of it.

413
00:21:28,635 --> 00:21:31,812
Yeah, when I think about it,
it's a sad twist.

414
00:21:31,855 --> 00:21:34,815
You can't blame me for wanting
the two of you to be happy.

415
00:21:34,858 --> 00:21:39,167
'Cause you will never do it
for yourself.

416
00:21:43,693 --> 00:21:46,174
Hey, wet-n-wild, you said
everything's the fault

417
00:21:46,217 --> 00:21:47,958
of the Thirteenth-
- But all mention of him

418
00:21:48,002 --> 00:21:49,612
has been stricken
from the archives.

419
00:21:49,656 --> 00:21:51,048
I'm not
a conspiracy theorist,

420
00:21:51,092 --> 00:21:52,528
but I'm workin' on a theory

421
00:21:52,572 --> 00:21:54,095
there might be a conspiracy.

422
00:21:54,138 --> 00:21:57,794
Somebody erased this guy
magically.

423
00:21:57,838 --> 00:22:00,667
But you know his name,
don't you?

424
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,233
- I will not speak it.

425
00:22:02,277 --> 00:22:04,497
- Oh, yes you will.

426
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,976
- Wait, what are you doing?

427
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,804
I went all the way
to your well,

428
00:22:07,848 --> 00:22:09,545
and if you don't tell us
what we need to know

429
00:22:09,589 --> 00:22:12,156
I am going to drink it
and then I'm going to pee it

430
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,723
and then Josh is going
to drink it.

431
00:22:13,767 --> 00:22:15,638
Yeah!
Wait, what?

432
00:22:15,682 --> 00:22:18,119
You monster!
- Tick, you can't do this.

433
00:22:18,162 --> 00:22:19,642
Dude, yeah,
that's sort of like torture.

434
00:22:19,686 --> 00:22:21,035
I thought we were against that.
- We are.

435
00:22:21,078 --> 00:22:22,732
She's the only one
who knows the name

436
00:22:22,776 --> 00:22:24,865
of the Thirteenth King,
and she is gonna tell us!

437
00:22:24,908 --> 00:22:26,170
Please, please!
You can't!

438
00:22:26,214 --> 00:22:28,172
No!

439
00:22:28,216 --> 00:22:29,957
- Ram's bottom, what was it-

440
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,262
The Thirteenth,
the Thirteenth...

441
00:22:31,306 --> 00:22:33,743
It's Roderick!
"Thirsty Roderick,

442
00:22:33,787 --> 00:22:35,832
"Thirteenth of his line,
always liked

443
00:22:35,876 --> 00:22:38,313
to have a good time."
- Oh, my God, you're right.

444
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,359
About what?
- A nursery rhyme.

445
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:41,969
I've been trying
to remember it all day.

446
00:22:42,012 --> 00:22:43,840
We used to sing it
while playing Bearskip.

447
00:22:43,884 --> 00:22:46,321
It's a children's game, sort
of like Fillorian hopscotch.

448
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,280
Involving bears?
- Ideally skipping them.

449
00:22:49,324 --> 00:22:52,240
"He hides his drinks
from his many daughters."

450
00:22:52,283 --> 00:22:54,111
"Builds a cistern
to hoard the waters."

451
00:22:54,155 --> 00:22:55,852
- "Underneath the castle fair."

452
00:22:55,896 --> 00:22:57,941
"If you jump,
you'll skip the bear!"

453
00:22:57,985 --> 00:22:59,334
- Okay.

454
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,249
Your nursery rhyme
used the word "cistern"?

455
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:02,903
Well, how else are children
supposed to learn

456
00:23:02,946 --> 00:23:04,731
about underground water
containment systems?

457
00:23:04,774 --> 00:23:07,560
You people are sick.
- Wait.

458
00:23:07,603 --> 00:23:10,345
He built underground water
containment systems?

459
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:13,261
"The Waters, they are moving."

460
00:23:13,304 --> 00:23:15,306
But were you really talking
about water?

461
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,221
She's always talking
about water.

462
00:23:17,265 --> 00:23:19,223
Unless she's talking
about magic.

463
00:23:19,267 --> 00:23:22,052
A huge reservoir of magic,
hidden underneath the castle

464
00:23:22,096 --> 00:23:24,054
that could be what's causing
all the stuff we're seeing.

465
00:23:24,098 --> 00:23:26,796
- Wait. Wait.

466
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,799
I think I know
how we can get to it.

467
00:23:29,843 --> 00:23:32,106
Follow me!

468
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:33,890
- Okay.

469
00:23:33,934 --> 00:23:35,979
- God, it hurts!

470
00:23:36,937 --> 00:23:38,242
- An incorporate bond?

471
00:23:38,286 --> 00:23:40,854
Why do you suddenly
need to know this?

472
00:23:40,897 --> 00:23:43,596
Uh, it's just something that
I've been wondering about.

473
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:44,814
- You're serious?

474
00:23:44,858 --> 00:23:46,903
You could be having fox sex

475
00:23:46,947 --> 00:23:50,907
with your partner,
the better magician.

476
00:23:50,951 --> 00:23:52,256
- I realize that.

477
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,737
She could do
incorporate bond.

478
00:23:54,781 --> 00:23:57,914
And she's chosen to have sex
with you for some reason.

479
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:01,657
You should be having as much
sex with her as you can

480
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:03,442
before she realizes.

481
00:24:03,485 --> 00:24:05,226
Thank you for
the relationship advice,

482
00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:08,621
an area that I'm sure
that you are an expert in.

483
00:24:08,664 --> 00:24:13,060
Oh, little pushback
from B-minus student.

484
00:24:13,103 --> 00:24:15,192
I like this.
- I'm just saying...

485
00:24:15,236 --> 00:24:18,326
there is something that you are
an actual expert in

486
00:24:18,369 --> 00:24:21,329
that I need to know about.
- Right.

487
00:24:21,372 --> 00:24:26,639
You "need" to know how to cast
an incorporate bond.

488
00:24:28,292 --> 00:24:31,121
What is your discipline?
- What?

489
00:24:31,165 --> 00:24:33,080
Your discipline,
B-minus student,

490
00:24:33,123 --> 00:24:36,779
or did you leave that back
in your tiny fox pants?

491
00:24:36,823 --> 00:24:39,869
- They tested me...

492
00:24:39,913 --> 00:24:43,003
inconclusive.
- Well, that is a problem.

493
00:24:43,046 --> 00:24:45,179
Can't cast incorporate bond

494
00:24:45,222 --> 00:24:46,963
without your discipline.

495
00:24:47,007 --> 00:24:48,704
There's got to be some kind
of workaround.

496
00:24:48,748 --> 00:24:50,227
- Nope.

497
00:24:50,271 --> 00:24:52,142
Come back
when you're fully-formed.

498
00:24:52,186 --> 00:24:53,970
Come on. There's got to be
something that you can do.

499
00:24:54,014 --> 00:24:55,319
I need this.

500
00:24:58,148 --> 00:25:00,455
Fine.
Drink that.

501
00:25:02,196 --> 00:25:04,198
This will help
with the test or...?

502
00:25:04,241 --> 00:25:07,767
It will kill brain cells.
I have plenty to spare.

503
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:11,205
You don't, but...

504
00:25:11,248 --> 00:25:14,034
I don't want to drink alone.

505
00:25:19,779 --> 00:25:21,476
- So this is it, huh?

506
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,915
Before we go in, there's
a small matter of protection.

507
00:25:38,101 --> 00:25:41,191
Swallow it.
- What is it?

508
00:25:41,235 --> 00:25:43,019
- Insects.

509
00:25:48,068 --> 00:25:49,896
Don't chew.
They have to go down whole

510
00:25:49,939 --> 00:25:53,029
so they can eat any poison
you take into your bloodstream.

511
00:26:02,082 --> 00:26:05,128
The bugs only last an hour,
so we need to be quick.

512
00:26:32,025 --> 00:26:34,027
There is something
you're not telling me.

513
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,333
Uh, what?
No, that's not true.

514
00:26:36,377 --> 00:26:39,119
You're a very bad liar,
B-minus!

515
00:26:39,162 --> 00:26:41,817
More like D-plus on this.

516
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:47,910
And I don't have to tell you
anything

517
00:26:47,954 --> 00:26:50,957
until you tell me
what you're hiding.

518
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:55,178
- It's complicated.

519
00:26:55,222 --> 00:26:58,834
- You're from future, yes?

520
00:26:58,878 --> 00:27:00,836
- What?

521
00:27:03,926 --> 00:27:09,062
What is in there is older
than what is in there.

522
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,806
Yeah. Yes, fine.
I am.

523
00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:16,983
I... Not me-me,
but my consciousness.

524
00:27:17,026 --> 00:27:19,376
I came here to ask you
about incorporate bonds.

525
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:22,292
Why didn't you ask me
in your time?

526
00:27:22,336 --> 00:27:24,468
I am dead or something?
- No.

527
00:27:24,512 --> 00:27:26,340
Look, I can't tell you
anything else.

528
00:27:26,383 --> 00:27:28,168
I can't risk messing
with the past.

529
00:27:28,211 --> 00:27:30,474
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.

530
00:27:30,518 --> 00:27:32,912
I've seen "Back to the Future."

531
00:27:32,955 --> 00:27:35,654
Ugh.

532
00:27:35,697 --> 00:27:39,396
You want to fuck your mother
in past?

533
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,573
What? No.
- Why? She not attractive?

534
00:27:42,617 --> 00:27:46,273
Look. I just can't tell you
any more about how I did this-

535
00:27:46,316 --> 00:27:49,842
I already know.
You use timeshare spell.

536
00:27:49,885 --> 00:27:52,279
I've been working on it.

537
00:27:52,322 --> 00:27:53,976
Clearly
I must have finished it.

538
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,152
And don't worry.

539
00:27:56,196 --> 00:27:57,980
Future is safe.

540
00:27:58,024 --> 00:28:01,549
Everything you say is
in the vault.

541
00:28:03,377 --> 00:28:06,554
This vault.

542
00:28:06,597 --> 00:28:08,991
I will definitely not remember

543
00:28:09,035 --> 00:28:11,037
anything
about this conversation

544
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,561
like most conversations
I have with students

545
00:28:13,604 --> 00:28:16,303
like you, D-plus.

546
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:42,721
This basis
for incorporate bond.

547
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:44,418
We are done here.

548
00:28:51,468 --> 00:28:54,297
You never told me
my discipline.

549
00:28:54,341 --> 00:28:56,691
- Repair of Small Objects.

550
00:28:58,475 --> 00:29:01,000
Really?
- Hope we did not ruin

551
00:29:01,043 --> 00:29:07,180
your big plans after you get
back to your mysterious future,

552
00:29:07,223 --> 00:29:09,356
Mr. Time Traveler.

553
00:29:13,012 --> 00:29:16,145
Tell my older self...

554
00:29:16,189 --> 00:29:18,060
well done.

555
00:29:23,457 --> 00:29:25,372
- Um...

556
00:29:25,415 --> 00:29:27,504
Oh, shit.

557
00:29:30,856 --> 00:29:32,814
- Alice.

558
00:29:32,858 --> 00:29:35,556
- What the hell, Q?

559
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:37,645
What did you cast?

560
00:29:37,688 --> 00:29:40,691
Some sort of spell to make
your future self

561
00:29:40,735 --> 00:29:43,085
take over
your past self's body?

562
00:29:43,129 --> 00:29:45,566
What happens that made
you have to do this?

563
00:29:45,609 --> 00:29:47,046
- I can't tell you that.

564
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:51,441
Well, can you talk
about what's happening with us?

565
00:29:51,485 --> 00:29:53,617
Of course you can't.
Paradox rules apply.

566
00:29:53,661 --> 00:29:55,881
I can't risk changing
the past.

567
00:29:55,924 --> 00:29:58,579
I could get lost forever.

568
00:29:58,622 --> 00:30:02,104
I could do a memory charm.
- Alice.

569
00:30:02,148 --> 00:30:06,805
I know one that will erase
my memory for the last hour.

570
00:30:09,155 --> 00:30:13,855
Okay. Yeah, sure.
Why?

571
00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:15,901
So we can talk about the way
you looked at me

572
00:30:15,944 --> 00:30:18,642
when you came back.

573
00:30:18,686 --> 00:30:21,080
There was so much...

574
00:30:21,123 --> 00:30:22,821
pain.

575
00:30:23,952 --> 00:30:25,954
A lot of things
have happened.

576
00:30:25,998 --> 00:30:27,913
- How bad?

577
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:32,526
- Pretty goddamn bad.

578
00:30:32,569 --> 00:30:35,268
- What happens?

579
00:30:35,311 --> 00:30:38,532
- You, uh, get hurt.

580
00:30:40,142 --> 00:30:42,275
We both do.

581
00:30:42,318 --> 00:30:44,233
So would you rather
I just stop this now

582
00:30:44,277 --> 00:30:48,194
so that we never have to feel
the way you feel?

583
00:30:48,237 --> 00:30:50,587
Look, you're a nice guy, Q,
for trying to warn me.

584
00:30:50,631 --> 00:30:51,980
- I'm not trying to-

585
00:30:52,024 --> 00:30:54,548
But I'm not scared
of the future.

586
00:30:54,591 --> 00:30:56,898
I'm scared of losing this.

587
00:30:56,942 --> 00:31:00,859
Maybe it's crazy and hopeless
where you live, but-

588
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:03,122
you know, maybe I never
told you this,

589
00:31:03,165 --> 00:31:07,517
but you are the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

590
00:31:13,349 --> 00:31:16,744
So...

591
00:31:16,787 --> 00:31:18,920
when you go back,

592
00:31:18,964 --> 00:31:21,096
just remember that, okay?

593
00:31:30,279 --> 00:31:33,195
What do you think made
Mayakovsky so bitter?

594
00:31:33,239 --> 00:31:35,197
Huh?
- And, like, obsessed

595
00:31:35,241 --> 00:31:39,898
with the vulpine sex
of his two students?

596
00:31:39,941 --> 00:31:41,638
- Yeah, it's weird, isn't it?

597
00:31:41,682 --> 00:31:43,684
No, no, it's totally normal.
He's a normal guy.

598
00:31:43,727 --> 00:31:46,121
These are normal school
situations.

599
00:31:49,124 --> 00:31:50,865
Seriously, though, you think
that he would notice

600
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:54,956
if we stopped tying
these knots?

601
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,568
Probably.
We shouldn't.

602
00:31:59,395 --> 00:32:03,138
- Hey. Crazy idea.

603
00:32:03,182 --> 00:32:06,968
What if we stopped tying
the knots

604
00:32:07,012 --> 00:32:11,059
and instead we...

605
00:32:11,103 --> 00:32:12,669
Hm?

606
00:32:12,713 --> 00:32:14,106
Um...
- Hm?

607
00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:16,630
Ooh, yeah.
We could do it on the table.

608
00:32:16,673 --> 00:32:18,762
- Quentin!

609
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,768
I don't-it's...
hotter in my head.

610
00:32:24,812 --> 00:32:26,988
- What?

611
00:32:27,032 --> 00:32:28,294
Hm?

612
00:32:28,337 --> 00:32:30,209
Oh, sorry, Vix.
You okay?

613
00:32:30,252 --> 00:32:31,862
- Yeah, no. I'm fine.

614
00:32:31,906 --> 00:32:34,778
- Mm. Yeah, you are.

615
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:51,012
- That was nice.

616
00:32:51,056 --> 00:32:53,319
Alice.
- Yeah?

617
00:32:53,362 --> 00:32:56,104
It's me.
I'm-I'm back.

618
00:32:56,148 --> 00:32:58,063
- Oh.

619
00:33:15,384 --> 00:33:19,040
The Binder's story began
in a place

620
00:33:19,084 --> 00:33:23,001
known simply as... a Library.

621
00:33:23,044 --> 00:33:24,872
- You were a Librarian?

622
00:33:24,915 --> 00:33:26,830
He did say it started
in the Library.

623
00:33:26,874 --> 00:33:28,049
I mean, it's fucking obvious.

624
00:33:28,093 --> 00:33:30,269
- He was studying

625
00:33:30,312 --> 00:33:32,836
the limits of power.

626
00:33:34,099 --> 00:33:39,843
His specialty was the magic
inherent in Gods.

627
00:33:39,887 --> 00:33:41,889
Great. A puppet show.

628
00:33:41,932 --> 00:33:43,412
- The Binder had a theory.

629
00:33:43,456 --> 00:33:47,242
When a being of great power,
such as a God, is killed

630
00:33:47,286 --> 00:33:51,681
their energy is lost, but he
believed it could be preserved

631
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:53,161
by binding it to an object.

632
00:33:53,205 --> 00:33:55,337
That object, in turn,
could be bound

633
00:33:55,381 --> 00:33:58,079
to a Magician of sufficient
training and preparation,

634
00:33:58,123 --> 00:34:00,429
effectively turning
the Magician into a God.

635
00:34:00,473 --> 00:34:03,128
Yeah, but every time
a mortal tries to kill

636
00:34:03,171 --> 00:34:06,131
a God, all magic gets shut off.

637
00:34:06,174 --> 00:34:10,004
The Binder politely reminded
Margo that

638
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,180
not every story was about her.

639
00:34:12,224 --> 00:34:14,356
So the binder
is a catty bitch?

640
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:18,360
Mm.
He continued.

641
00:34:19,883 --> 00:34:22,321
It was a problem that perplexed

642
00:34:22,364 --> 00:34:25,367
The Binder
and his fellow Librarians,

643
00:34:25,411 --> 00:34:28,153
but, as it turned out,

644
00:34:28,196 --> 00:34:32,200
the Old Gods themselves
provided a solution.

645
00:34:34,202 --> 00:34:37,075
Two siblings.
Mistakes.

646
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:39,860
Born with the power
of many gods.

647
00:34:39,903 --> 00:34:42,819
They were created
with one unique quality

648
00:34:42,863 --> 00:34:44,908
that made them essential
to this experiment.

649
00:34:44,952 --> 00:34:47,998
They could not die.

650
00:34:49,565 --> 00:34:51,350
So no matter what you did
to them it wouldn't trigger

651
00:34:51,393 --> 00:34:53,308
the Old Gods
to take away magic.

652
00:34:53,352 --> 00:34:56,094
Without fear
of the Old Gods' retribution,

653
00:34:56,137 --> 00:34:58,313
The Librarians were safe

654
00:34:58,357 --> 00:35:00,489
to move forward
with their experiment.

655
00:35:00,533 --> 00:35:02,230
One of the Monsters
was captured-

656
00:35:02,274 --> 00:35:04,014
the older, more dominant one.

657
00:35:04,058 --> 00:35:05,451
The female.
- Natch.

658
00:35:05,494 --> 00:35:08,062
The one left behind
would be confused,

659
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:12,022
afraid, like a child.

660
00:35:12,066 --> 00:35:14,982
Without his sister, he'd have
trouble even remembering them.

661
00:35:15,025 --> 00:35:17,550
What did you do
to the sister?

662
00:35:21,423 --> 00:35:23,295
She was split
into four parts.

663
00:35:23,338 --> 00:35:25,993
Each part bound in a stone.

664
00:35:26,036 --> 00:35:30,780
Each stone bound
in a Librarian.

665
00:35:30,824 --> 00:35:35,437
- Bacchus. Iris. Heka. Aengus.

666
00:35:35,481 --> 00:35:38,179
- Those ballsacks.

667
00:35:38,223 --> 00:35:40,399
- When they were finished,

668
00:35:40,442 --> 00:35:44,881
The Binder came to regret
what he had done.

669
00:35:44,925 --> 00:35:49,886
But the New Gods he had built
were afraid of him.

670
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:53,020
He alone held the secret that
could make them human again.

671
00:35:53,063 --> 00:35:54,978
And so...

672
00:35:56,284 --> 00:35:59,026
They cursed him.

673
00:35:59,069 --> 00:36:01,071
- They turned you into a book.

674
00:36:01,115 --> 00:36:04,162
- Okay. That does kind of suck.

675
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:08,949
In that form, he became
something they could control.

676
00:36:08,992 --> 00:36:12,431
Hide from the rest
of The Order, from history.

677
00:36:12,474 --> 00:36:14,259
It was only by chance

678
00:36:14,302 --> 00:36:16,478
that a young Librarian
read his book

679
00:36:16,522 --> 00:36:18,350
and was convinced

680
00:36:18,393 --> 00:36:20,569
to hide The Binder
in the mirror world,

681
00:36:20,613 --> 00:36:22,528
where he hoped no one
would find him again.

682
00:36:22,571 --> 00:36:26,314
Until word reached The Binder
of Julia Wicker,

683
00:36:26,358 --> 00:36:28,360
and her quest.

684
00:36:28,403 --> 00:36:32,233
He knew he had the answers
she sought.

685
00:36:32,277 --> 00:36:34,540
So he can help me become
a Goddess again?

686
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:36,846
He could take her
in either direction.

687
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:40,241
The Godhood, or Humanity.

688
00:36:40,285 --> 00:36:42,287
The choice was hers.

689
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:44,506
Either road would be painful.

690
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:48,293
He wondered aloud
if she was ready.

691
00:36:48,336 --> 00:36:49,990
- You and me both.

692
00:36:50,033 --> 00:36:52,079
The Binder knew
she needed time

693
00:36:52,122 --> 00:36:54,212
to consider which way to go.

694
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:57,476
But either way...

695
00:36:57,519 --> 00:37:00,392
he'd need a favor in return.

696
00:37:03,656 --> 00:37:08,313
He needed her
to burn his book.

697
00:37:11,054 --> 00:37:14,493
He did not want
to be used again.

698
00:37:14,536 --> 00:37:18,236
Like it was before.

699
00:37:38,386 --> 00:37:40,258
I got it.

700
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,484
Do we have time for that?

701
00:37:49,528 --> 00:37:50,964
First thing you learn
in The Order

702
00:37:51,007 --> 00:37:52,313
is how to speed read.

703
00:38:05,587 --> 00:38:07,415
Everett's been lying
to all of us.

704
00:38:07,459 --> 00:38:09,374
It's just as we suspected.

705
00:38:09,417 --> 00:38:12,246
He's been hoarding magic.

706
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,161
- To do what?

707
00:38:14,204 --> 00:38:16,076
- To become a God.

708
00:38:18,252 --> 00:38:20,385
And if this book is correct,

709
00:38:20,428 --> 00:38:22,125
he succeeds.

710
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,829
The floor in this hallway
is laid out

711
00:38:29,872 --> 00:38:32,397
in the exact pattern
of a Bearskip board.

712
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,487
Now, that can't just be
a coincidence.

713
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:37,358
- Can't it though?

714
00:38:37,402 --> 00:38:41,493
Just... jump forward
three squares.

715
00:38:41,536 --> 00:38:42,755
- Okay.

716
00:38:42,798 --> 00:38:44,583
- Not the dragon!

717
00:38:44,626 --> 00:38:46,802
- Watch the sloth!

718
00:38:46,846 --> 00:38:48,456
Now duck.
- Duck?

719
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,545
There's a bear on your right.
- Seriously?

720
00:38:50,589 --> 00:38:52,808
That one got my leg.
- Okay!

721
00:38:52,852 --> 00:38:57,813
Oh, no.
Don't get me bear!

722
00:38:57,857 --> 00:38:59,989
'Cause you successfully
"skipped the bear,"

723
00:39:00,033 --> 00:39:02,383
you get to throw
the sweetberry.

724
00:39:02,427 --> 00:39:04,777
And I throw it
at the last whatever?

725
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,692
- The hibernation square.

726
00:39:06,735 --> 00:39:09,521
- Okay, jeez.

727
00:39:11,871 --> 00:39:14,264
- Ah! Yes! You did it.

728
00:39:14,308 --> 00:39:15,483
- Huh.

729
00:39:18,443 --> 00:39:22,360
That is... still good.

730
00:39:22,403 --> 00:39:23,578
I say what again?

731
00:39:23,622 --> 00:39:25,493
Oh.
- Oh! Right. Right, right.

732
00:39:25,537 --> 00:39:26,886
Honey or die!

733
00:39:32,587 --> 00:39:36,852
Where does it lead?
- Only one way to find out.

734
00:39:36,896 --> 00:39:38,680
- Seriously?

735
00:39:38,724 --> 00:39:40,378
Perfect timing.
We should return

736
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:41,988
right between shift changes.
- That's good.

737
00:39:42,031 --> 00:39:45,905
Is it weird I've had this
chocolate taste in my mouth?

738
00:39:45,948 --> 00:39:49,648
As the bugs absorb more
poison the aftertaste changes.

739
00:39:49,691 --> 00:39:51,911
It's when you taste mint
we're in real trouble.

740
00:39:53,608 --> 00:39:55,393
- Okay.

741
00:40:00,572 --> 00:40:02,530
It's locked.

742
00:40:02,574 --> 00:40:03,836
- Don't you have the key?

743
00:40:03,879 --> 00:40:06,012
The key is
for the other side.

744
00:40:06,055 --> 00:40:08,710
Someone locked us in.

745
00:40:08,754 --> 00:40:11,409
- I have worse news.

746
00:40:11,452 --> 00:40:12,932
I just tasted mint.

747
00:40:12,975 --> 00:40:15,935
Hm.

748
00:40:17,632 --> 00:40:20,330
- You think Hyman is right?

749
00:40:20,374 --> 00:40:22,376
What he said about us?

750
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,465
God, I don't know if that man
has any fucking clue

751
00:40:24,509 --> 00:40:28,469
what's going on, but maybe.

752
00:40:28,513 --> 00:40:31,037
'Cause I've been thinking
about becoming a Goddess a lot.

753
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:35,345
How to do it without screwing
up like the other Gods did.

754
00:40:35,389 --> 00:40:36,825
I don't know.

755
00:40:36,869 --> 00:40:39,872
Maybe I should give some
airtime to the alternative.

756
00:40:39,915 --> 00:40:41,917
- Becoming human?

757
00:40:44,529 --> 00:40:46,487
- I mean being happy.

758
00:40:46,531 --> 00:40:48,358
- Okay.

759
00:40:49,969 --> 00:40:53,755
Pros and cons.
You become a Goddess...

760
00:40:53,799 --> 00:40:55,801
you get all powered up.

761
00:40:55,844 --> 00:40:58,020
Maybe help in the fight.

762
00:40:58,064 --> 00:40:59,935
You become human...

763
00:40:59,979 --> 00:41:01,589
- I get to feel things.

764
00:41:01,633 --> 00:41:04,462
- Yeah, like hunger.

765
00:41:04,505 --> 00:41:06,594
And sadness and...

766
00:41:06,638 --> 00:41:08,770
- And this...

767
00:41:19,433 --> 00:41:21,479
- Was that a pro or a con?

768
00:41:28,137 --> 00:41:30,879
I have a problem.

769
00:41:32,751 --> 00:41:35,014
She's dying.
- Who's dying?

770
00:41:35,057 --> 00:41:36,929
- My sister.

771
00:41:36,972 --> 00:41:39,801
I found her a body, but...

772
00:41:39,845 --> 00:41:43,413
it's not strong enough.

773
00:41:43,457 --> 00:41:45,633
I need to find one that is...

774
00:41:45,677 --> 00:41:48,506
more durable.

775
00:41:49,594 --> 00:41:50,812
Like yours.

776
00:41:57,036 --> 00:42:01,475
So Mayakovsky told you
what your discipline is?

777
00:42:04,043 --> 00:42:08,482
- Repair of Small Objects.

778
00:42:09,962 --> 00:42:12,094
You did always excel
at Minor Mendings.

779
00:42:12,138 --> 00:42:14,532
I always thought
it'd be something cooler.

780
00:42:14,575 --> 00:42:17,099
- At least it's real.

781
00:42:17,143 --> 00:42:18,840
Now you don't have to
fantasize anymore

782
00:42:18,884 --> 00:42:21,887
about who you are and lie
about who you wish you were.

783
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:24,716
You just-you just know it now.

784
00:42:26,718 --> 00:42:28,894
And maybe
you've always known it.

785
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:34,029
Show me.

786
00:43:14,548 --> 00:43:15,854
- How does it feel?

787
00:43:15,897 --> 00:43:18,900
Like I helped it
wake up and...

788
00:43:18,944 --> 00:43:21,468
remember what it was before.
