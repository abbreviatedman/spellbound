QUENTIN:
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:03,587 --> 00:00:06,079
KADY: <i>Everett's trying
to squeeze out hedges.</i>

3
00:00:06,173 --> 00:00:08,085
This is just
more of the same.

4
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,924
We're here to study
with Mayakovsky.

5
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,034
- We hear he's crazy.
- MAYAKOVSKY: You heard wrong!

6
00:00:16,058 --> 00:00:17,390
JOSH: <i>So wait.</i>

7
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:19,934
So you turned Mayakovsky
into a bear?

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,182
I can help.

9
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,808
Just let me stay.

10
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:27,267
You saved my life.
You can save my life 50 times.

11
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:31,230
It's not gonna change
anything between us.

12
00:00:31,323 --> 00:00:33,235
Goodbye, Alice.

13
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:36,534
The Poison Room. It's where we store books
too dangerous for the public.

14
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,782
You must seek the Binder.

15
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,329
ALICE: <i>This was
in the Mirror World.</i>

16
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:43,158
And I heard you were looking
for the Binder, so...

17
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:45,622
Holy shit.

18
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,374
Foremost saved them

19
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,626

20
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,082
<i>They call them ice axes,</i>

21
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,042
<i>and I'm assuming
that's poetic license.</i>

22
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,173
MARGO: <i>So we might have
a chance to save Eliot.</i>

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,552
MARGO: But Hot and Dumb
just wasn't getting it.

24
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,426
And that's when I told
the Foreskin,

25
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,603
"Welcome to the New
Desert Order.

26
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:05,476
"It's gonna suck for you."

27
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,502
Wow. You really went through
a lot to get those axes.

28
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:09,768
Call them by their names.

29
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,527
Sorrow,

30
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,987
- and Sorrow.
- JULIA: Nice.

31
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,781
Where'd you get
the axes from?

32
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,906
Fine. I'll tell it
one more time.

33
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:22,433
- So I'm all, "Welcome to the New Desert Order.

00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,574

36
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,453
MARGO:
Telling this story over again.

37
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:30,413
And so I was like,

38
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,591
"Welcome to the New Desert Order.
Gonna suck for you."

39
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:36,511
- What did I miss?
- I'm getting a smoothie.

40
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,179
You fuckers take this.

41
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,412
QUENTIN: You seriously...
You spent that much time in the desert,

42
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:43,636
and this never
occurred to you?

43
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:46,471
We're dealing
with god-level monsters.

44
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:48,397
Who possess people.

45
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,391
Those axes
pull the spirits out,

46
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,147
and then
we bottle them up. Bam!

47
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,478
FTW.

48
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:56,064
All he's saying
is they're too powerful.

49
00:01:56,158 --> 00:01:58,275
I doubt your bottles
can hold that shit.

50
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:01,202
Those monsters are coming for us.
Make it work.

51
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:02,705
Okay, but how?

52
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,497
We could cast an incorporate bond
on the bottles.

53
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:06,791
Thank you.

54
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:09,836
I don't know what that is,
but I hate you less now.

55
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:12,334
It's a way to pin a being
or object in place.

56
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,711
It's like a fourth-dimensional
paperweight.

57
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,418
Mayakovsky was trapped
under one for years.

58
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:20,129
We just need
to pin The Monster to your bottles

59
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,423
long enough
to get rid of them.

60
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:24,267
Great.
Let's do that shit, then.

61
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,804
So who knows
how to cast an incorporate bond?

62
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:31,100
I did cast an incorporate bond
on Mayakovsky,

63
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:33,685
but I didn't
write the spell myself.

64
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,145
So who wrote it?

65
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,695
Mayakovsky did.

66
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:39,115
He didn't know
I was going to use it on him.

67
00:02:39,201 --> 00:02:41,818
He was the only person
capable of writing a spell

68
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:42,948
which he couldn't break.

69
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,825
He knows more things
about incorporate bonds

70
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:45,915
than anyone else does.

71
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:50,205
You wanted a spell
to trap a god, yes?

72
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,252
Well... He's the real expert.

73
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:56,086
- But he's also a bear.
- Not exactly.

74
00:02:56,176 --> 00:03:01,672
You see, once magic came back,
he was able to become human. Again.

75
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:04,007
Much to his wife's dismay.

76
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,016
So where is he now?

77
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,890
He went back
to Brakebills South?

78
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:10,687
- MARGO: I mean, why?
- Brakebills isn't using it.

79
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:12,734
There's not enough magic
for the geese to make it.

80
00:03:13,485 --> 00:03:15,192
I found that out
the hard way.

81
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,065
Rest in peace, first years.

82
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:20,489
So, I guess we have to go down there
and talk to Mayakovsky?

83
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,691
Sounds like a plan.

84
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,072
You two have fun
talking to that old drunk.

85
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,032
No.

I just... I... There's, um...

I don't wanna be alone with you, either.
I never said that.

98
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,286
Yes, you did.
I heard you say that to Margo.

99

ALICE: Mayakovsky did this
to himself.

112
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:53,074
He designed a spell to swap
his present consciousness

113
00:04:53,168 --> 00:04:54,875
with one
from a different time.

114
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,497

Not mentally, no.

118
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,836
Based on these notes
and his current state,

119
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,673
I think he's from the future,
where...

120
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:10,179
Mayakovsky has dementia.

121
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:13,932
- Great. (SIGHS)
- Well, it was an accident.

122
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,105
He inverted two of
the numbers in the spell.

123
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:17,727

we can help him, Quentin.

are a danger to the books?

352
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:09,644
I think she smokes
and doesn't want anyone to know.

You seem distant lately.

358
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,868
I wondered
if something had happened.

359
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:25,326
If anything were wrong,
I'd tell you.

Sorry to interrupt,
but there has been an incident.

It's Fogg.

366
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,179
Perhaps it's time
for someone to talk to him

367
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:47,686
- who isn't a friend.
- Of course.

that is happening

Unless she's talking
about magic.

A huge reservoir of magic,
hidden underneath the castle.

I realize that.

00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:52,011
She could do incorporate bond.

with you for some reason.

in the Library.

658
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:26,372
I mean, it's fucking obvious.

659
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,378
He was studying

660
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:30,335
the limits of power.

661
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:36,929
His specialty was the magic
inherent in gods.

662
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,509
PENNY 23:
Great. A puppet show.

663
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:41,996
THE BINDER:
The Binder had a theory.

664
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:45,184
When a being of great power,
such as a god, is killed,

665
00:33:46,066 --> 00:33:50,106
their energy is lost,
but he believed it could be preserved

666
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:51,731
by binding it
to an object.

667
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,687
That object, in turn,
could be bound

668
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:56,570
to a Magician of sufficient
training and preparation,

669
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,323
effectively turning
the Magician into a god.

670
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:02,075
Yeah, but every time
a mortal tries to kill a god,

671
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,031
all magic gets shut off.

672
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,953
The Binder
politely reminded Margo that

673
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,750
not every story was about her.

674
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,957
So the Binder
is a catty bitch?

675
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,051
(GROANS)

676
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:16,920
He continued.

677
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,931
It was a problem
that perplexed

678
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:23,350
the Binder
and his fellow Librarians,

679
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:26,144
but, as it turned out,

680
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:30,601
the old gods themselves
provided a solution.

681
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:35,234
Two siblings. Mistakes.

682
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:38,323
Born with the power
of many gods.

683
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:41,118
They were created
with one unique quality

684
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,366
that made them essential
to this experiment.

685
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:46,457
They could not die.

686
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:50,106
So no matter what you did to them,
it wouldn't trigger

687
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,871
the old gods
to take away magic.

688
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:54,423
Without fear
of the old gods' retribution,

689
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:59,095
The Librarians were safe
to move forward with their experiment.

690
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,637
One of the Monsters
was captured,

691
00:35:00,724 --> 00:35:03,057

The female.

692
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:04,143
Natch.

693
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,184
The one left behind
would be confused,

694
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,767
afraid, like a child.

695
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:13,052
Without his sister, he'd have trouble
even remembering them.

696
00:35:13,737 --> 00:35:15,148
What did you do to the sister?

697
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,867
She was split into four parts.

698
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,445
Each part bound in a stone.

699
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:29,079
Each stone bound
in a Librarian.

When they were finished,

703
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,007
the Binder came to regret
what he had done.

704
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:47,135
But the new gods he had built
were afraid of him.

705
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:51,481
He alone held the secret
that could make them human again.

706
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:52,682
And so...

707
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:55,939
They cursed him.

708

into a book.

709
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:02,654
- Okay. That does kind of suck.
- (THE BINDER SIGHS)

710
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:05,987
In that form, he became something
they could control.

711
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:10,374
Hide from the rest
of The Order, from history.

712
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:15,167
It was only by chance
that a young Librarian read his book

713
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,918
and was convinced

714
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,170
to hide the Binder
in the Mirror World,

715
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,126
where he hoped no one
would find him again.

716
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:24,885
Until word reached the Binder
of Julia Wicker,

717
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,931
and her quest.

718
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,726
He knew he had
the answers she sought.

719
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:33,139
So you can help me
become a goddess again?

720
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:35,270
He could take her
in either direction.

721
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,353
The godhood, or humanity.

722
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:40,529
The choice was hers.

723
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,111
Either road would be painful.

724
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,615
He wondered aloud
if she was ready.

725
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,446
You and me both.

726
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:52,250
The Binder knew she needed time
to consider which way to go.

727
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:53,913
But either way,

728
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:58,873
he'd need a favor in return.

729
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,676
He needed her
to burn his book.

730
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:11,598
He did not want
to be used again.

731
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,139
Like he was before.

It's just as we suspected.

739
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,573
He's been hoarding magic.

740
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:11,914
To do what?

741
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,576
To become a god.

742
00:38:16,586 --> 00:38:18,043
And if this book is correct,

743
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,255
he succeeds.

just be a coincidence.

Oh, no. Don't get me, bear!

Because you successfully
"skipped the bear,"

757

you get to throw
