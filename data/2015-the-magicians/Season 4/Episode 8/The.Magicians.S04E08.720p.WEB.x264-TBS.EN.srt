1
00:00:07,216 --> 00:00:09,064
Previously, on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:09,074 --> 00:00:11,286
To go back to 40, you're
gonna want to turn this dial

3
00:00:11,296 --> 00:00:13,695
three clicks to the right.
Tell Kady I love her.

4
00:00:13,705 --> 00:00:16,468
Pete? You're Lovelady?

5
00:00:17,295 --> 00:00:18,917
This is the Black Market?

6
00:00:18,927 --> 00:00:20,626
You'd be surprised what
you can find in here.

7
00:00:20,636 --> 00:00:23,412
- Josh, I didn't...
- Didn't mean to hurt me?

8
00:00:23,422 --> 00:00:24,532
Yes, you did.

9
00:00:24,542 --> 00:00:26,894
Believe it or not, I know
exactly who you are, Margo.

10
00:00:26,904 --> 00:00:28,124
- Who's she?
- That's Carol.

11
00:00:28,134 --> 00:00:29,224
That's Carol?

12
00:00:31,983 --> 00:00:33,867
Poppy Kline. Draconologist,

13
00:00:33,877 --> 00:00:35,662
post-graduate fellow,
and fuel researcher.

14
00:00:41,486 --> 00:00:43,271
Hey, who are you?

15
00:00:43,281 --> 00:00:45,578
Why am I having these stupid dreams?

16
00:00:47,732 --> 00:00:49,169
Harriet?

17
00:00:52,294 --> 00:00:53,427
Sheila Cozener?

18
00:00:53,437 --> 00:00:54,787
You've been a busy girl.

19
00:00:54,797 --> 00:00:56,775
They have my friend Sheila.

20
00:00:56,785 --> 00:00:58,493
I know.

21
00:01:00,914 --> 00:01:02,541
I need your help.

22
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,358
Jesus-based-on-the-novel-
Christ-by-Sapphire.

23
00:01:20,368 --> 00:01:22,197
What... what are you doing here?

24
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,051
I thought you needed some help.

25
00:01:24,061 --> 00:01:26,272
You're welcome, by the way,
for risking regicide.

26
00:01:26,282 --> 00:01:28,056
"Help"? But you just wished me well

27
00:01:28,066 --> 00:01:31,886
on my... my "solo op" not a day ago.

28
00:01:31,896 --> 00:01:34,236
I had a good think about that, Fen.

29
00:01:34,246 --> 00:01:37,152
And, uh, these dreams
you've been having...

30
00:01:37,162 --> 00:01:39,633
who are they really about?

31
00:01:39,643 --> 00:01:42,810
Well, I dreamed of a bunny
with its throat all...

32
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,986
Me, Fen.

33
00:01:44,996 --> 00:01:47,641
Talking animals are my constituency,

34
00:01:47,651 --> 00:01:49,643
and your next dream was about

35
00:01:49,653 --> 00:01:51,906
my birthright lizard.

36
00:01:51,916 --> 00:01:54,561
I... I also dreamt about Josh.

37
00:01:54,571 --> 00:01:58,130
Fucking up some shit he was
supposed to be cooking for me.

38
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,740
Sorry, it's...

39
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,917
I just thought that it was, you know...

40
00:02:02,927 --> 00:02:05,833
my quest.

41
00:02:05,843 --> 00:02:07,182
Okay.

42
00:02:07,192 --> 00:02:09,794
On the off chance,
then I'm your wingwoman.

43
00:02:09,804 --> 00:02:12,231
Right.

44
00:02:12,241 --> 00:02:15,549
I don't mean to pry
but, uh, speaking of Josh...

45
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:18,759
- Are you and he...
- We're fine.

46
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:19,847
Not fighting?

47
00:02:19,857 --> 00:02:21,632
Fen, Josh is a guy I banged,

48
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,285
and when a woman of a certain caliber

49
00:02:23,295 --> 00:02:25,766
in a certain skill set
bangs a guy like Josh...

50
00:02:25,776 --> 00:02:28,247
or basically anyone who isn't
a complete sociopath...

51
00:02:28,257 --> 00:02:31,163
they get a little weird.

52
00:02:31,173 --> 00:02:32,817
It'll pass.

53
00:02:32,827 --> 00:02:34,645
Okay, so it's not about...

54
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,734
Fen, don't accuse me

55
00:02:36,744 --> 00:02:38,823
of catching feelings, all right?

56
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,085
It's insulting.

57
00:02:40,095 --> 00:02:41,826
Okay, sorry.

58
00:02:41,836 --> 00:02:43,392
Well, if we're both here,

59
00:02:43,402 --> 00:02:45,220
who'll run the kingdom?

60
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,874
Josh.

61
00:02:51,802 --> 00:02:53,751
Don't forget your little knife.

62
00:02:56,154 --> 00:02:58,320
So all of a sudden you need my help?

63
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,671
Yes, it really must be you.

64
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,934
As long as this doesn't end
with you arresting me.

65
00:03:02,944 --> 00:03:06,894
It won't. And does end with you
letting my friend Sheila Cozener go.

66
00:03:06,904 --> 00:03:09,244
She hasn't done anything wrong.
Just the opposite.

67
00:03:09,254 --> 00:03:11,638
You should get Zelda to promise to bury

68
00:03:11,648 --> 00:03:13,118
the woman's book, as well.

69
00:03:13,128 --> 00:03:15,729
Otherwise they can always
find her again.

70
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:17,383
And you.

71
00:03:17,393 --> 00:03:20,734
Zelda needs your knowledge
of the Mirror World.

72
00:03:20,744 --> 00:03:24,008
Your experience is, well,
exceedingly rare.

73
00:03:25,227 --> 00:03:27,349
Who's in the Mirror World?

74
00:03:27,359 --> 00:03:29,134
Harriet.

75
00:03:29,144 --> 00:03:31,789
The Fuzzbeater...

76
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:34,835
who undermined everything
that you believe in.

77
00:03:34,845 --> 00:03:38,099
She's always had a strong spirit.

78
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:40,798
Like her mother.

79
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,149
I didn't know.

80
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,194
She didn't want you to.

81
00:03:46,204 --> 00:03:48,719
Look, those who go into the Mirror World

82
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,416
rarely find their way out, but you did.

83
00:03:50,426 --> 00:03:53,298
- I hoped you could...
- Recap my time as a monster?

84
00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:56,204
Funny, when I offered you
my notes before,

85
00:03:56,214 --> 00:03:57,684
you said you had everything.

86
00:03:57,694 --> 00:03:59,773
I didn't know then...

87
00:03:59,783 --> 00:04:02,167
how much I didn't know.

88
00:04:02,177 --> 00:04:03,995
I went in to find her.

89
00:04:04,005 --> 00:04:05,474
I found something else.

90
00:04:05,484 --> 00:04:08,782
Like reflections, but incomplete.

91
00:04:08,792 --> 00:04:11,176
Wrong, warped.

92
00:04:11,186 --> 00:04:13,134
I called them shards.

93
00:04:13,144 --> 00:04:15,789
When you're in there
long enough, it refracts you.

94
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:18,313
Those weren't her, they were echoes.

95
00:04:18,323 --> 00:04:20,402
You need to track down the real her,

96
00:04:20,412 --> 00:04:21,795
but that'll be a problem.

97
00:04:21,805 --> 00:04:23,144
Why?

98
00:04:23,154 --> 00:04:25,146
Doing magic in there
is insanely dangerous.

99
00:04:25,156 --> 00:04:27,768
When I was a niffin I...

100
00:04:29,421 --> 00:04:31,413
I experimented.

101
00:04:31,423 --> 00:04:34,939
It's easy for a spell to go haywire.

102
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:38,029
Bounce around, kill everything
in its path.

103
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:40,737
Pretty gruesomely.

104
00:04:41,664 --> 00:04:44,383
What you need to do is pull her out.

105
00:04:44,393 --> 00:04:47,081
Good. How?

106
00:04:47,091 --> 00:04:49,257
I might have something.

107
00:04:49,267 --> 00:04:52,173
If Zelda has agreed
to your terms, of course.

108
00:04:52,183 --> 00:04:54,393
Free Sheila, then bury her book.

109
00:04:54,403 --> 00:04:55,742
Yes.

110
00:04:55,752 --> 00:04:58,005
And an extra month's supply

111
00:04:58,015 --> 00:05:01,008
of campus-wide rations every semester.

112
00:05:01,018 --> 00:05:03,455
A month? That's...

113
00:05:05,109 --> 00:05:07,101
Fine. Agreed.

114
00:05:07,111 --> 00:05:08,320
The spell?

115
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:10,148
It turns an ordinary object

116
00:05:10,158 --> 00:05:13,455
into, well, sort of a beacon.

117
00:05:13,465 --> 00:05:18,199
Relies on very specific connections
between people. In fact...

118
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:21,899
the only person in this room with
any shot of pulling this off

119
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:23,857
is you, Alice.

120
00:05:23,867 --> 00:05:25,168
What does that mean?

121
00:05:25,179 --> 00:05:30,091
Well, something I suspect you're
not going to enjoy in the least.

122
00:05:38,503 --> 00:05:41,310
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -

123
00:05:49,768 --> 00:05:53,060
It is not a good morning, America.

124
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,584
Because of you, I stopped
doing anything fun

125
00:05:55,594 --> 00:05:58,065
to this body, so why is my inside

126
00:05:58,075 --> 00:05:59,588
full of angry ants?

127
00:05:59,598 --> 00:06:01,852
Well, you're probably
going through withdrawal

128
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,289
from drinking, drugs...

129
00:06:04,299 --> 00:06:05,812
More drugs would help.

130
00:06:05,822 --> 00:06:07,466
No.

131
00:06:07,476 --> 00:06:09,207
No drugs. We have a deal.

132
00:06:09,217 --> 00:06:11,209
That you would help me find a god

133
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:13,254
and that I wouldn't hurt
this body anymore,

134
00:06:13,264 --> 00:06:16,997
but your eyes were closed,
so... not helpful.

135
00:06:17,007 --> 00:06:19,260
No deal.

136
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,435
Yes, drugs.

137
00:06:20,445 --> 00:06:23,525
No. Look, I found some leads.

138
00:06:23,535 --> 00:06:24,962
Okay?

139
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:29,009
Charlemagne's globus cruciger.

140
00:06:29,019 --> 00:06:30,619
You know, it...
that could have been a...

141
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:33,187
I give you a mummy
and you give me guesses.

142
00:06:33,197 --> 00:06:35,624
The mandrake god is dead.

143
00:06:35,634 --> 00:06:37,975
Finding his piece should be easy.

144
00:06:37,985 --> 00:06:40,944
I just need another day.

145
00:06:41,945 --> 00:06:43,860
Please.

146
00:06:48,343 --> 00:06:51,259
There's a man in the TV
who deserves my wrath.

147
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:55,383
I'll be back when I'm done with him.

148
00:07:00,311 --> 00:07:02,129
That was not super dignified.

149
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:03,478
If you have any ideas,

150
00:07:03,488 --> 00:07:06,655
we're looking for an ancient artifact

151
00:07:06,665 --> 00:07:09,484
that was lost to the Black
Market a few hundred years ago.

152
00:07:09,494 --> 00:07:11,660
Actually, I...

153
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:13,538
I do know a guy.

154
00:07:14,586 --> 00:07:15,723
But...

155
00:07:16,588 --> 00:07:18,580
Julia's not gonna like it.

156
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,973
Pete?

157
00:07:19,983 --> 00:07:21,583
He's...

158
00:07:21,593 --> 00:07:23,324
untrustworthy and a creep.

159
00:07:23,334 --> 00:07:25,631
- No.
- Actually...

160
00:07:25,641 --> 00:07:27,502
I go by Lovelady now.

161
00:07:27,512 --> 00:07:30,505
It's just, we're not really
in a position

162
00:07:30,515 --> 00:07:32,782
to refuse help right now.

163
00:07:32,793 --> 00:07:33,958
Fine.

164
00:07:33,969 --> 00:07:36,755
You guys can deal with Lovelady.

165
00:07:38,567 --> 00:07:41,004
I'm getting a drink.

166
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:46,913
She made Lovelady sound lame.

167
00:07:46,923 --> 00:07:48,567
What'd you find?

168
00:07:48,577 --> 00:07:51,091
Okay...

169
00:07:51,101 --> 00:07:52,701
we have this rock.

170
00:07:52,711 --> 00:07:55,182
Petrifies anything it touches.

171
00:07:56,498 --> 00:07:58,272
And I know you said "stone organ."

172
00:07:58,282 --> 00:08:02,189
This is a pipe organ...
extremely cursed.

173
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:04,017
- No.
- Okay, this doesn't

174
00:08:04,027 --> 00:08:06,541
look like much, but legend has it

175
00:08:06,551 --> 00:08:08,804
there's a lot of power trapped inside.

176
00:08:08,815 --> 00:08:10,632
But, uh, no one knows...

177
00:08:10,642 --> 00:08:12,939
- How to crack it open.
- Yes, Pete, this is it.

178
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:14,506
Well, you're not gonna believe this,

179
00:08:14,516 --> 00:08:16,682
but it's actually
in the hoard of a dragon.

180
00:08:16,692 --> 00:08:18,336
Which are real.

181
00:08:18,346 --> 00:08:20,294
- Oh, yeah, we know.
- Yeah, I've met three.

182
00:08:20,304 --> 00:08:21,655
Oh, you...

183
00:08:21,956 --> 00:08:25,342
okay, uh, this dragon, though,
is in New York.

184
00:08:25,353 --> 00:08:27,475
The Hudson tunnels. Yeah, I've met her.

185
00:08:27,485 --> 00:08:29,173
No, East River.

186
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,653
Garbage dragon, got it.

187
00:08:31,663 --> 00:08:33,699
So how do we get an audience?

188
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:36,397
You talk to her herald.

189
00:08:36,407 --> 00:08:38,225
The dragon has an assistant?

190
00:08:38,235 --> 00:08:40,778
9:00 a.m. Bring something to trade.

191
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:44,666
Great, so we have a few hours to
find something to impress a dragon.

192
00:08:46,765 --> 00:08:50,281
There's... gotta be something
around here.

193
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,065
Your friends are lovely.

194
00:08:52,075 --> 00:08:54,382
Well, after this we're even.

195
00:08:55,108 --> 00:08:58,058
You saved my life, so... no.

196
00:08:58,069 --> 00:08:59,625
Not quite.

197
00:08:59,636 --> 00:09:01,411
What, you're surprised?

198
00:09:01,422 --> 00:09:05,198
You thought I was
a complete selfish prick?

199
00:09:05,349 --> 00:09:08,125
What do you really know about me?

200
00:09:08,135 --> 00:09:09,517
Oh, right... that I was

201
00:09:09,527 --> 00:09:11,476
a fucking great lieutenant to Marina.

202
00:09:11,486 --> 00:09:14,305
What I am is loyal.

203
00:09:14,315 --> 00:09:17,482
To the right person.

204
00:09:17,492 --> 00:09:19,614
- And that's me?
- Could be.

205
00:09:19,624 --> 00:09:22,400
You ready to graduate
from helping your college buds

206
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,576
to solving a real crisis?

207
00:09:24,586 --> 00:09:27,013
Like what's happening with the hedges.

208
00:09:27,023 --> 00:09:30,451
When one hedge blows up
a Library branch, it gets bad.

209
00:09:30,461 --> 00:09:32,540
Who knew?

210
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,803
- Does the Library know who did it?
- No.

211
00:09:34,813 --> 00:09:38,329
So we're all terrorists.

212
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:40,809
They're making Library cards
mandatory, outlawing spells...

213
00:09:40,819 --> 00:09:42,202
You're right.

214
00:09:42,212 --> 00:09:44,291
We gotta do something.

215
00:09:44,301 --> 00:09:46,815
Turn Whitley in. She did it.

216
00:09:46,825 --> 00:09:49,818
She stood here and said
she would make them pay

217
00:09:49,828 --> 00:09:51,081
for killing her boyfriend.

218
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,473
They did kill her boyfriend.

219
00:09:52,483 --> 00:09:54,475
They almost killed me.

220
00:09:54,485 --> 00:09:57,478
They deserve to pay. She did us a favor.

221
00:09:57,488 --> 00:10:00,307
She made life harder for all of us.

222
00:10:00,317 --> 00:10:03,354
Look, I'm on the Library's list.

223
00:10:03,364 --> 00:10:06,400
I can't turn her in.

224
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:09,664
But you can.

225
00:10:09,674 --> 00:10:11,362
Take the heat off of everyone

226
00:10:11,372 --> 00:10:14,375
until we figure out what to do next.

227
00:10:17,552 --> 00:10:19,152
23.

228
00:10:19,162 --> 00:10:20,414
Thought you bailed.

229
00:10:20,424 --> 00:10:22,721
Just, you know...

230
00:10:22,731 --> 00:10:24,766
figuring some shit out.

231
00:10:24,776 --> 00:10:28,248
So Shoshana, she...

232
00:10:28,258 --> 00:10:30,163
she get you solved?

233
00:10:30,173 --> 00:10:33,471
Mm, she's dead.

234
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:35,473
I'm sorry. That's heavy.

235
00:10:35,483 --> 00:10:36,735
Yeah, it is.

236
00:10:36,745 --> 00:10:38,780
Still no answers.

237
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:41,218
No closer to what I am.

238
00:10:41,228 --> 00:10:42,871
And Eliot's still alive,

239
00:10:42,881 --> 00:10:46,614
but that means we have
to help The Monster.

240
00:10:46,624 --> 00:10:48,355
Which is why I'm drinking.

241
00:10:51,847 --> 00:10:54,666
I could use a drink, too.

242
00:10:54,676 --> 00:10:57,244
I have a real fun message to deliver.

243
00:11:00,508 --> 00:11:02,108
Hey.

244
00:11:02,118 --> 00:11:03,718
Where've you been?

245
00:11:03,728 --> 00:11:05,503
Timeline jumping.

246
00:11:05,513 --> 00:11:09,430
I actually met your Penny.

247
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:13,119
He's... he's, well, dead,

248
00:11:13,129 --> 00:11:15,904
but good.

249
00:11:15,914 --> 00:11:19,222
And he asked me to tell you
that he's sorry.

250
00:11:20,484 --> 00:11:23,173
And he loves you.

251
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:25,837
In other words, not coming back, right?

252
00:11:27,448 --> 00:11:29,580
That's...

253
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:33,410
What am I supposed to do with that?

254
00:11:38,328 --> 00:11:40,755
Truth is, he...

255
00:11:40,765 --> 00:11:42,496
was pretty broken up about it.

256
00:11:42,506 --> 00:11:46,249
He asked that you let him go.

257
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,809
He's proud of you.

258
00:11:50,819 --> 00:11:53,725
He knows you're moving on,
taking charge.

259
00:11:53,735 --> 00:11:56,771
You're gonna find your way and...

260
00:11:58,566 --> 00:12:00,785
Be happy.

261
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,693
God, what the fuck does he know?

262
00:12:19,543 --> 00:12:21,318
Well, this is just what I needed today.

263
00:12:21,328 --> 00:12:22,720
Hi, Mom.

264
00:12:24,461 --> 00:12:26,410
I went to get a Library card

265
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:28,716
and they treated me like
the mother of a criminal...

266
00:12:28,726 --> 00:12:31,676
which... I guess I am now.

267
00:12:31,686 --> 00:12:34,244
- What did you tell them?
- What is there to tell?

268
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:37,561
I never see you
unless you need something.

269
00:12:39,694 --> 00:12:41,696
It's just a simple cooperative spell.

270
00:12:43,176 --> 00:12:45,255
And yet you came all this way.

271
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:48,398
Okay, it requires
a mother and a daughter.

272
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:52,740
Well, you could say "please."

273
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,828
Fine.

274
00:12:53,838 --> 00:12:55,656
Please.

275
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:59,225
I'm afraid we have to make it quick.
I have plans.

276
00:13:07,565 --> 00:13:09,774
Wow, you've really done
a lot with this place.

277
00:13:09,785 --> 00:13:13,518
Well, the Library helped me redo
Daniel's architectural spells

278
00:13:13,528 --> 00:13:15,433
and his protection wards.

279
00:13:15,443 --> 00:13:17,653
You mean that crazy
lock-down spell Dad installed

280
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:19,742
after he saw "The Purge"?

281
00:13:19,752 --> 00:13:21,874
I'm alone now, Alice.

282
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,191
A defenseless widow.

283
00:13:25,496 --> 00:13:27,619
What's that?

284
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:30,666
The Library put that in after
the Modesto Act of Terror.

285
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:32,842
Keeps track of magic use.

286
00:13:32,852 --> 00:13:34,800
So you take their handouts,
and in exchange

287
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,497
you let them spy on you?

288
00:13:36,507 --> 00:13:38,499
The gas company keeps a meter
behind the garage.

289
00:13:38,509 --> 00:13:40,763
Are they spying on me?

290
00:13:40,773 --> 00:13:43,548
The Library saved magic, Alice.

291
00:13:43,558 --> 00:13:45,463
They provide a resource.

292
00:13:45,473 --> 00:13:47,813
Who cares if they keep track
of who uses it?

293
00:13:47,823 --> 00:13:50,250
They gave you extra magic for that?

294
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,513
You always resented my flowers.

295
00:13:52,523 --> 00:13:54,515
You're both pretty.

296
00:13:54,525 --> 00:13:56,430
You both deserve my attention.

297
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,910
Jesus Christ, Stephanie.

298
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,903
I don't give a shit about
your stupid ditch weeds.

299
00:13:59,914 --> 00:14:02,700
Lives are at stake. Let's get started.

300
00:14:05,972 --> 00:14:07,877
I mean, sure it's enchanted,

301
00:14:07,887 --> 00:14:10,401
but what's a dragon gonna do
with a human-sized telescope?

302
00:14:10,411 --> 00:14:12,533
I don't know. I'm all out of baby teeth.

303
00:14:12,543 --> 00:14:14,579
Hello? Yes, we are going to be

304
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:17,277
delayed indefinitely. Please hold.

305
00:14:17,287 --> 00:14:19,497
No, no, not until
we've located the item.

306
00:14:19,507 --> 00:14:21,847
I'm gonna have to call you back.
Please hold.

307
00:14:21,857 --> 00:14:24,633
Please hold, I...
This is not a good time.

308
00:14:24,643 --> 00:14:26,983
It has to be now. You the herald?

309
00:14:26,993 --> 00:14:30,639
I'm Harold, the Herald of
the East River Dragon.

310
00:14:30,649 --> 00:14:33,380
I responded to a confusingly
worded help-wanted ad.

311
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:35,382
Can we just talk to your boss?

312
00:14:35,392 --> 00:14:36,470
We're closed, sir.

313
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,646
I... Just come on.

314
00:14:37,656 --> 00:14:39,560
We have an emergency.

315
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,824
Regarding an item
that perhaps you've lost,

316
00:14:41,834 --> 00:14:43,869
or someone may have stolen?

317
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:45,610
Yeah, we could help. We could find it.

318
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,568
Nice offer, but I doubt you can.

319
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:49,875
Just tell us what got stolen.

320
00:14:49,885 --> 00:14:51,703
Yeah, come on. We're professionals.

321
00:14:55,369 --> 00:14:58,579
This elixir is worth more
than both of you.

322
00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:00,059
The Great Lady of the East River

323
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:01,582
will give you whatever you choose

324
00:15:01,592 --> 00:15:03,584
if you recover it.

325
00:15:03,594 --> 00:15:05,064
But you won't.

326
00:15:05,074 --> 00:15:08,502
The thief used this.

327
00:15:08,512 --> 00:15:09,895
It's untrackable.

328
00:15:09,905 --> 00:15:12,603
Can I see that?

329
00:15:15,606 --> 00:15:17,012
We can do this.

330
00:15:17,023 --> 00:15:18,164
You seem confident.

331
00:15:18,175 --> 00:15:21,037
Yeah, his tracking spell failed
because he used the wrong circumstances.

332
00:15:21,047 --> 00:15:22,649
He didn't know where the thief got this.

333
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,780
- Which is?
- Fillory.

334
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,956
Hello? Yes. Right away.

335
00:15:34,974 --> 00:15:37,657
- Are you the lady from...
- Your dreams?

336
00:15:41,894 --> 00:15:43,624
So you're a prophet?

337
00:15:43,634 --> 00:15:47,106
And a, uh, cat-type person?

338
00:15:47,116 --> 00:15:49,021
Did I appear in your dreams as well?

339
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,589
Wait, you don't know

340
00:15:51,599 --> 00:15:53,547
if you were in my dreams?

341
00:15:53,557 --> 00:15:55,734
It was rhetorical.

342
00:15:57,561 --> 00:15:59,815
You desire your future.

343
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:02,818
See you're just stating the obvious.

344
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:05,821
A vision.

345
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:07,823
You are leaving.

346
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:10,434
You did not earn
what you're here to seek.

347
00:16:10,444 --> 00:16:12,436
No, no, no, ignore her.

348
00:16:12,446 --> 00:16:14,665
I will do anything.

349
00:16:16,493 --> 00:16:18,834
The vision changes.

350
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,139
You're celebrating.

351
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:22,794
You stand on a stone path

352
00:16:22,804 --> 00:16:25,449
that you will lay.

353
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:28,669
Next to a roof you re-thatch

354
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:31,150
near a garden you will plant.

355
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,154
So to get a prophecy we have
to landscape your yard, huh?

356
00:16:35,164 --> 00:16:36,503
Your wish is...

357
00:16:36,513 --> 00:16:38,493
My command.

358
00:16:39,473 --> 00:16:40,635
Small note?

359
00:16:40,646 --> 00:16:43,946
Your whole predicting-what-
we're-gonna-say thing is a tad...

360
00:16:43,956 --> 00:16:45,121
Annoying.

361
00:16:45,131 --> 00:16:47,514
Oh, you're good.

362
00:16:56,244 --> 00:16:57,931
Poppy.

363
00:16:58,187 --> 00:17:00,614
What are you doing in
the Physical Kids' Cottage?

364
00:17:00,624 --> 00:17:03,530
I've been meaning to reach out.

365
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,706
Notice you got magic back. Amazing.

366
00:17:05,716 --> 00:17:08,840
They didn't have an appropriate
thank-you card at Target.

367
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:12,452
So you got this in Fillory
and used it to rob a dragon?

368
00:17:12,462 --> 00:17:14,890
Uh, no. Why would I?

369
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,759
Because you're a
dragon-obsessed crazy person

370
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,253
who does selfish things
for personal gain.

371
00:17:18,264 --> 00:17:22,898
Oh, please. Name one
example of... wait, don't.

372
00:17:22,908 --> 00:17:25,030
I remember.

373
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,685
You're literally dripping
with sweat, which is a...

374
00:17:27,695 --> 00:17:30,122
usually a pretty good sign that
somebody's hiding something.

375
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:33,788
Okay, fine. You caught me.

376
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:38,401
Happy?

377
00:17:40,882 --> 00:17:42,743
Hello?

378
00:17:42,753 --> 00:17:44,920
Q?

379
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,922
- Anyone?
- Hey.

380
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:48,837
What are... what are you doing here?

381
00:17:48,847 --> 00:17:51,752
What are you? You were
supposed to be back hours ago.

382
00:17:51,762 --> 00:17:53,145
Kady had to cast a locator.

383
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:55,756
Somebody moved this entire cottage.

384
00:17:55,766 --> 00:17:56,975
Right, uh, sorry.

385
00:17:56,985 --> 00:17:59,848
Things just got, um, so complicated.

386
00:17:59,858 --> 00:18:01,937
- Is that chili?
- Yeah.

387
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:03,677
Will you just give me a...

388
00:18:03,687 --> 00:18:05,864
will you just excuse me
for a second, um...

389
00:18:10,259 --> 00:18:12,730
- Oh, hey, there.
- Oh, hello.

390
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,774
Belly.

391
00:18:13,784 --> 00:18:15,515
Okay, before you ask:

392
00:18:15,525 --> 00:18:17,126
Yes, it was my tranquilizer dart.

393
00:18:17,136 --> 00:18:19,084
But some douchewad stole it from me.

394
00:18:19,094 --> 00:18:20,781
I would never cross a dragon.

395
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:23,262
I'm not an idiot.

396
00:18:23,272 --> 00:18:25,090
Um, but what are you doing here?

397
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,136
I needed a place to gestate,

398
00:18:27,146 --> 00:18:30,835
and I'm, mm, technically
still enrolled, so...

399
00:18:35,719 --> 00:18:38,189
Julia, we have some news.

400
00:18:39,245 --> 00:18:41,628
I'm going to be a dad.

401
00:18:50,732 --> 00:18:54,073
Well, this is some serious
Mr. Miyagi bullshit.

402
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,815
But wasn't Mr. Miyagi

403
00:18:56,825 --> 00:18:58,556
actually training Daniel-san

404
00:18:58,566 --> 00:19:00,601
for his big fight against Cobra Kai?

405
00:19:00,611 --> 00:19:02,995
Do you think we're learning
secret fighting skills?

406
00:19:03,005 --> 00:19:06,172
When did you watch "The Karate Kid"?

407
00:19:06,182 --> 00:19:08,087
Over there, the garden is overgrown

408
00:19:08,097 --> 00:19:09,697
with Strangler Vines.

409
00:19:09,707 --> 00:19:11,787
Why do you think
we're avoiding that part?

410
00:19:11,797 --> 00:19:13,179
I have seen a vision.

411
00:19:13,189 --> 00:19:15,181
All vines trimmed by your hand.

412
00:19:15,191 --> 00:19:17,193
Weeds, gone.

413
00:19:21,241 --> 00:19:22,710
Where you going?

414
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,539
I'm gonna go take care of a weed.

415
00:19:25,549 --> 00:19:27,106
It's an act, right?

416
00:19:27,116 --> 00:19:29,935
She's gotta be the one
that stole from the dragon.

417
00:19:29,945 --> 00:19:32,590
I don't know, Q's acting like it's real.

418
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,680
He's taking this whole "father"
thing pretty seriously.

419
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,813
He's talking about what kind
of dad he wants to be.

420
00:19:37,823 --> 00:19:39,640
I mean, look at her.

421
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:42,600
She's sketchy on a good day.

422
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,820
Definitely hiding something.

423
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,866
I can feel it through every mental ward.

424
00:19:47,876 --> 00:19:50,826
Bet she cast some shit on him.

425
00:19:52,185 --> 00:19:54,917
Dragon erotica?

426
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:57,745
"The Dragon Riders of Porn."

427
00:19:57,755 --> 00:20:00,096
By Poppy Kline.

428
00:20:00,106 --> 00:20:04,317
Oh, number-one best seller
in its category.

429
00:20:04,327 --> 00:20:06,667
Oh, wow.

430
00:20:06,677 --> 00:20:09,061
It's detailed.

431
00:20:09,071 --> 00:20:10,681
The elixir?

432
00:20:12,727 --> 00:20:15,154
I thought Q said
he didn't find anything.

433
00:20:15,164 --> 00:20:18,080
Why is it empty?

434
00:20:22,998 --> 00:20:24,772
It's not glowing, Alice.

435
00:20:24,782 --> 00:20:26,600
I can see that, Stephanie.

436
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:27,993
Well, that's five tries,

437
00:20:28,003 --> 00:20:29,995
and I am not having my magic suspended

438
00:20:30,005 --> 00:20:31,605
because of your thumb-heavy casting.

439
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,216
I'm not thumb-heavy!

440
00:20:33,226 --> 00:20:36,175
It's not your fault that
you inherited Daniel's fingers.

441
00:20:36,185 --> 00:20:37,960
The problem is casting a spell

442
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,700
that requires a connection with a mother

443
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,267
who refuses to be called "Mom."

444
00:20:41,277 --> 00:20:43,879
Connections take two people, Alice.

445
00:20:45,368 --> 00:20:46,969
I don't mean to be rude,

446
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,884
but I did tell you
that I had previous plans.

447
00:20:48,894 --> 00:20:51,060
Now you act like I can
just drop everything

448
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,018
for your thick-fingered spells.

449
00:20:53,028 --> 00:20:55,728
The reason it's not working is because
you would rather go on a date

450
00:20:55,739 --> 00:20:56,979
than help your own daughter.

451
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,284
It's not a date.

452
00:20:58,294 --> 00:20:59,895
It's Carol.

453
00:20:59,905 --> 00:21:02,985
The last time you saw her
you electrocuted her,

454
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:05,248
so best not test her loyalty.

455
00:21:05,258 --> 00:21:07,990
The Library offers rewards
for fugitives.

456
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,165
Out the back.

457
00:21:13,222 --> 00:21:17,042
I'm not leaving without my spell.

458
00:21:17,052 --> 00:21:19,044
Nice illusion work, Carol.

459
00:21:19,054 --> 00:21:20,393
You look great.

460
00:21:20,403 --> 00:21:22,308
I mean, you always look great, I just...

461
00:21:22,318 --> 00:21:24,658
I'm... I'm really sorry about last time.

462
00:21:24,668 --> 00:21:26,747
Let's just leave it
in the past, shall we?

463
00:21:26,757 --> 00:21:28,227
For what it's worth,

464
00:21:28,237 --> 00:21:30,360
the Library doesn't like me
very much, either.

465
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,463
Why is that?

466
00:21:31,474 --> 00:21:33,954
My new business.

467
00:21:40,423 --> 00:21:42,372
Marital aids.

468
00:21:42,382 --> 00:21:45,766
Your partner feels everything,
even long-distance.

469
00:21:45,776 --> 00:21:47,768
Especially long-distance.

470
00:21:47,778 --> 00:21:50,336
Oh. Wow.

471
00:21:50,346 --> 00:21:52,773
Now, who is that?

472
00:21:52,783 --> 00:21:53,964
They work for the Library.

473
00:21:53,975 --> 00:21:55,428
Well, I'll just send them away.

474
00:21:55,438 --> 00:21:57,082
What are they doing here
in the first place?

475
00:21:57,092 --> 00:21:58,214
I don't know what...

476
00:21:58,224 --> 00:22:00,259
You called them on me.

477
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:01,826
I would never!

478
00:22:01,836 --> 00:22:03,620
Oh, would you just stop
for once, Mother?

479
00:22:11,977 --> 00:22:13,185
Bollocks.

480
00:22:13,195 --> 00:22:14,505
No, wh... what did you do?

481
00:22:14,516 --> 00:22:16,448
My dad's Purge protocol.
I locked them out.

482
00:22:16,459 --> 00:22:18,766
And us in.

483
00:22:20,724 --> 00:22:24,109
Aah! Fen! Fen!

484
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:26,459
Umber's Balls! What did you do?

485
00:22:26,469 --> 00:22:29,810
I shoved this bullshit artist
right in the briar patch.

486
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,291
Thought she'd see it coming. Guess not.

487
00:22:32,301 --> 00:22:34,424
Margo, don't do this.
I'll never get my prophecy.

488
00:22:34,434 --> 00:22:36,339
Yes, free me or no prophecy!

489
00:22:36,349 --> 00:22:39,951
Oh, shut your lie-gina,
you cat-dressing con artist.

490
00:22:39,961 --> 00:22:41,474
How can I save you?

491
00:22:41,484 --> 00:22:43,955
I see some shears

492
00:22:43,965 --> 00:22:45,478
in the shed!

493
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:48,090
What?

494
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,961
You didn't predict this?

495
00:22:49,971 --> 00:22:51,963
It's all a lie, Fen.

496
00:22:51,973 --> 00:22:55,063
She's been using us to do her shit work.

497
00:22:56,846 --> 00:22:59,752
Oh, my gods.

498
00:22:59,763 --> 00:23:02,060
I deloused this wench's goat.

499
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:05,063
Okay, I confess! I lied!

500
00:23:05,073 --> 00:23:07,500
No shit, Benedict Cumber-douche.

501
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,936
But why?

502
00:23:08,946 --> 00:23:11,504
Because you people keep coming.

503
00:23:11,514 --> 00:23:14,072
Eating my food and...

504
00:23:14,082 --> 00:23:15,769
and ruining my yard.

505
00:23:15,779 --> 00:23:17,162
We do?

506
00:23:17,172 --> 00:23:19,077
In dreams she appears near here,

507
00:23:19,087 --> 00:23:20,513
so you all come to find her.

508
00:23:20,523 --> 00:23:22,515
And then you force them to work for you.

509
00:23:22,525 --> 00:23:24,822
I only wanted to repair
what was destroyed

510
00:23:24,832 --> 00:23:26,128
by pilgrims like you.

511
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:29,522
So the real Green Hood, what's her deal?

512
00:23:29,532 --> 00:23:31,959
A Questing Creature.

513
00:23:31,969 --> 00:23:33,396
She can only be caught in dreams.

514
00:23:33,406 --> 00:23:34,919
It's tricky.

515
00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:36,834
She is called The Napster.

516
00:23:36,844 --> 00:23:39,924
- "Napster"?
- Like the music-sharing site?

517
00:23:39,934 --> 00:23:42,405
I met Sean Parker at an Arby's.

518
00:23:42,415 --> 00:23:46,061
I seriously underestimate you
sometimes, you know that?

519
00:23:46,071 --> 00:23:47,801
Yeah, no, I know that.

520
00:23:47,811 --> 00:23:49,151
Well, not anymore.

521
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:51,153
I hate Fillory for making me say this,

522
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:54,731
but we have to shut down The Napster.

523
00:24:04,036 --> 00:24:06,899
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Uh...

524
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:09,902
Poppy wanted to feel like
she was on a beach,

525
00:24:09,912 --> 00:24:13,132
so just... I'm helping her out.

526
00:24:15,265 --> 00:24:18,137
Definitely acting normal.

527
00:24:22,533 --> 00:24:25,918
Holy shit.

528
00:24:25,928 --> 00:24:28,485
Guys, I think I've got it.

529
00:24:28,495 --> 00:24:31,358
Yeah, I mean, that's one way
of putting it...

530
00:24:31,368 --> 00:24:32,663
the way the lava's erupting.

531
00:24:32,673 --> 00:24:34,187
Don't... don't you get it?

532
00:24:34,197 --> 00:24:36,852
It's the elixir.

533
00:24:38,897 --> 00:24:40,323
- Oh, God.
- Ah!

534
00:24:41,639 --> 00:24:43,500
The elixir is dragon spooge.

535
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:45,502
Why? Why would she steal that?

536
00:24:45,512 --> 00:24:48,157
Holy fuck.

537
00:24:48,167 --> 00:24:51,465
So, remember how we said
Quentin was the father?

538
00:24:51,475 --> 00:24:52,596
We lied.

539
00:24:52,606 --> 00:24:54,163
So you're saying you...

540
00:24:54,173 --> 00:24:55,991
Turkey-bastered myself
with dragon semen.

541
00:24:56,001 --> 00:24:57,384
No big.

542
00:24:57,394 --> 00:24:59,690
I have a few... thousand questions.

543
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,302
Think of dragons
as universal sperm donors.

544
00:25:02,312 --> 00:25:04,608
Makes for some really cool hybrids.

545
00:25:04,618 --> 00:25:06,306
My kid's gonna be epic.

546
00:25:06,316 --> 00:25:08,699
It sounds kind of dangerous.

547
00:25:08,709 --> 00:25:10,527
Do you have any idea
how big it's gonna...

548
00:25:10,537 --> 00:25:12,355
Oh, nope. This is a first.

549
00:25:12,365 --> 00:25:14,009
Historic.

550
00:25:14,019 --> 00:25:16,272
I suggest you back the fuck up.

551
00:25:16,282 --> 00:25:18,709
No one is taking my baby.

552
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:21,582
Said the world's first
true mama of dragons.

553
00:25:21,592 --> 00:25:23,062
Look, Poppy, I don't know you,

554
00:25:23,072 --> 00:25:25,064
but you're acting kind of...

555
00:25:25,074 --> 00:25:27,370
just trust me when I say
magical pregnancies

556
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,372
can mess with your head.

557
00:25:29,382 --> 00:25:32,385
Especially the people around you.

558
00:25:34,387 --> 00:25:37,380
Oh, crap.

559
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:41,167
You know what, hold that...
two... thought two seconds.

560
00:25:41,177 --> 00:25:42,569
Guys, sidebar?

561
00:25:46,225 --> 00:25:48,217
Dragon fetus.

562
00:25:48,227 --> 00:25:50,045
That's why Q's acting crazy.

563
00:25:50,055 --> 00:25:52,482
Must have some sort
of built-in protection.

564
00:25:52,492 --> 00:25:55,147
It's touch.

565
00:25:59,238 --> 00:26:02,101
So that's dragon pregnancy porn?

566
00:26:02,111 --> 00:26:04,016
Don't kink shame.

567
00:26:04,026 --> 00:26:07,236
No, it says here that
dragon babies have a pheromone.

568
00:26:07,246 --> 00:26:10,631
Anything touches them, it takes over.

569
00:26:10,641 --> 00:26:13,329
Forces them to nurture
so the baby's safe.

570
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:15,679
So Q touched Poppy's belly,

571
00:26:15,689 --> 00:26:17,464
and now they're nesting.

572
00:26:17,474 --> 00:26:19,258
The hell are we gonna do?

573
00:26:21,217 --> 00:26:22,773
Traveler-proof wards.

574
00:26:22,783 --> 00:26:24,210
Balls.

575
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,125
I'm supposed to be on easy duty.

576
00:26:26,135 --> 00:26:29,063
"Tag 'em and bag 'em," not
"manage 'a hostage situation,"

577
00:26:29,074 --> 00:26:30,520
for shit's sake.

578
00:26:30,531 --> 00:26:32,815
- We know it's a hostage situation?
- Don't be daft.

579
00:26:32,826 --> 00:26:34,508
When people turn in friends and family,

580
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:36,183
sometimes they take it a touch personal.

581
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:38,137
You think she realized
that Stephanie called us?

582
00:26:38,147 --> 00:26:40,400
Muhammed, I have no idea.

583
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:42,066
I also don't really give a fuck.

584
00:26:42,085 --> 00:26:45,677
I do. Protocol dictates
that we break in there.

585
00:26:46,329 --> 00:26:48,321
Arrest the fugitive
before anything happens.

586
00:26:48,331 --> 00:26:50,671
Let me know
when you get through the wards.

587
00:26:50,681 --> 00:26:52,194
I'll just be over here.

588
00:26:52,204 --> 00:26:53,511
Wanking.

589
00:26:54,772 --> 00:26:57,644
We can deploy the screamers.

590
00:26:59,516 --> 00:27:02,248
You're doing the paperwork.

591
00:27:02,258 --> 00:27:04,641
Alice, I don't know

592
00:27:04,651 --> 00:27:06,730
why they're here, okay?

593
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:09,733
It's probably just a...
a friendly, routine visit.

594
00:27:09,743 --> 00:27:10,970
Just admit it, Stephanie.

595
00:27:10,981 --> 00:27:13,260
- You blame me for all your problems.
- That is not true.

596
00:27:13,271 --> 00:27:15,057
You barely think of me as a daughter.

597
00:27:15,068 --> 00:27:16,820
The second you had a chance
to turn me in

598
00:27:16,831 --> 00:27:19,526
- for your own benefit, you took it.
- No, I didn't!

599
00:27:19,536 --> 00:27:23,356
I... turned in Carol.

600
00:27:23,366 --> 00:27:25,112
What?

601
00:27:25,123 --> 00:27:27,273
Hi, Carol.

602
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:36,108
We came for the elixir.
The elixir's definitely gone.

603
00:27:36,118 --> 00:27:38,327
We're not getting it back, so now what?

604
00:27:38,337 --> 00:27:39,676
I don't know.

605
00:27:39,686 --> 00:27:42,689
I guess we gotta find something
else to give the dragon.

606
00:27:43,821 --> 00:27:47,119
It says here that dragon eggs
take three years to gestate.

607
00:27:47,129 --> 00:27:49,164
So this is informative

608
00:27:49,174 --> 00:27:51,340
dragon pregnancy porn.

609
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,864
Poppy stole the elixir last week.

610
00:27:53,874 --> 00:27:55,779
Would she be this pregnant already?

611
00:27:55,789 --> 00:27:56,867
You think she's lying.

612
00:27:56,877 --> 00:27:58,869
Well, it's Poppy.

613
00:27:58,879 --> 00:28:00,697
I mean, what... what sounds real?

614
00:28:00,707 --> 00:28:03,831
A reptile-redhead hybrid
or a lying thief

615
00:28:03,841 --> 00:28:06,138
stashing actual fertilized
dragon eggs somewhere?

616
00:28:06,148 --> 00:28:08,183
I'll beat it out of him.

617
00:28:08,193 --> 00:28:09,880
So you're...

618
00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:12,883
- Normal human pregnant.
- Seriously?

619
00:28:12,893 --> 00:28:14,711
How do we ever believe anything you say?

620
00:28:14,721 --> 00:28:17,497
- It's called a misdirect.
- Yeah, so that you didn't find Falcor.

621
00:28:17,507 --> 00:28:18,759
We're not calling it "Falcor."

622
00:28:18,769 --> 00:28:20,326
Would you please let me have...

623
00:28:20,336 --> 00:28:21,805
Okay, well, how is it even possible

624
00:28:21,815 --> 00:28:23,416
you used the elixir to fertilize that?

625
00:28:23,426 --> 00:28:25,418
Duh. Dragons are just fancy fish.

626
00:28:25,428 --> 00:28:27,550
Spray a load on the egg, and voila.

627
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,204
Okay, you two have got
the pheromone crazies.

628
00:28:29,214 --> 00:28:33,469
You've touched the egg and now
it's making you do stupid things.

629
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:35,010
You let go of Falcor!

630
00:28:35,021 --> 00:28:38,344
I will murder you if you hurt my baby!
Do you understand?

631
00:28:38,354 --> 00:28:40,911
Uh, guys?

632
00:28:40,921 --> 00:28:43,479
Why do I want to lick this egg?
I want to lick this egg.

633
00:28:43,489 --> 00:28:45,568
Oh, that goes away in a few minutes.

634
00:28:47,189 --> 00:28:49,658
- Oh, boy.
- Egg beats oven mitts, bitch.

635
00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:51,115
Now you're my sister-wife.

636
00:28:51,126 --> 00:28:52,749
Yo, Julia, you want to
get a lick off this egg?

637
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,059
Oh, four parents? I mean, I
guess it worked on "Big Love."

638
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,764
Julia, do not lick that egg!
Don't... don't!

639
00:28:59,766 --> 00:29:02,759
The funny thing is,
magic doesn't work on me

640
00:29:02,769 --> 00:29:04,631
the way it does on you!

641
00:29:04,642 --> 00:29:07,601
Travel or follow us, and it's
eggs over easy, you hear me?

642
00:29:10,429 --> 00:29:12,552
It's Sam's gun. The cop.

643
00:29:12,562 --> 00:29:14,421
- I kept it.
- Smart.

644
00:29:14,432 --> 00:29:16,908
No, no...

645
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,135
Falcor...

646
00:29:34,658 --> 00:29:36,476
The Library won't stop
at screaming books.

647
00:29:36,486 --> 00:29:37,912
We have to find a way out of here.

648
00:29:37,922 --> 00:29:40,785
Or Carol could do the right thing

649
00:29:40,795 --> 00:29:42,525
and turn herself in.

650
00:29:42,535 --> 00:29:44,789
All I'm doing is selling intimacy aids.

651
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:46,486
Oh, please.

652
00:29:46,496 --> 00:29:49,794
Half your customers use them
to punish their enemies.

653
00:29:49,804 --> 00:29:52,274
Carol, voodoo dolls for fucking

654
00:29:52,284 --> 00:29:54,320
are still fucking voodoo dolls.

655
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:56,322
They are.

656
00:29:56,332 --> 00:29:58,280
Could we use those
on the Librarians outside?

657
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,805
They require DNA.

658
00:30:00,815 --> 00:30:02,894
Oh, I have that.

659
00:30:02,904 --> 00:30:05,548
Oh, Jesus Christ, Miss Judgey.

660
00:30:05,558 --> 00:30:07,333
I didn't.

661
00:30:07,343 --> 00:30:08,900
Not that I wouldn't,

662
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:11,293
but they were here this morning,

663
00:30:11,303 --> 00:30:13,731
and their mugs are in the sink.

664
00:30:15,743 --> 00:30:17,343
And maybe next time...

665
00:30:17,353 --> 00:30:18,997
you will listen to me.

666
00:30:19,007 --> 00:30:20,738
I have been trying

667
00:30:20,748 --> 00:30:22,870
to get rid of you all day long.

668
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,829
The least you could do is acknowledge

669
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:26,656
that I didn't turn you in.

670
00:30:26,666 --> 00:30:28,833
You turned in your best friend.

671
00:30:28,843 --> 00:30:31,531
That spell just proves
that we are strangers.

672
00:30:31,541 --> 00:30:33,620
And I am fine with it,
because I wouldn't want

673
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:35,622
to be related to somebody
who did what you did.

674
00:30:35,632 --> 00:30:37,329
You...

675
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:43,727
Alice, you do not make this easy.

676
00:30:45,598 --> 00:30:47,852
I know what you're capable of.

677
00:30:47,862 --> 00:30:50,734
Good and bad.

678
00:30:52,562 --> 00:30:54,859
But there is nothing that you could say,

679
00:30:54,869 --> 00:30:57,383
there is nothing that you could do,

680
00:30:57,393 --> 00:31:00,962
that would make me turn you in.

681
00:31:04,966 --> 00:31:08,230
You are all I have.

682
00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:16,576
Could we try the mother-daughter spell

683
00:31:16,586 --> 00:31:17,761
one more time?

684
00:31:24,812 --> 00:31:26,770
Why did it work this time?

685
00:31:31,775 --> 00:31:33,985
You and I never liked each other,

686
00:31:33,995 --> 00:31:36,944
and when Dad died, I thought
that we'd finally be done

687
00:31:36,954 --> 00:31:39,435
and you'd wash your hands
as a mother, but you didn't.

688
00:31:41,611 --> 00:31:43,516
You still protect me.

689
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:45,866
In your own way.

690
00:31:45,876 --> 00:31:48,042
Which means I was the one

691
00:31:48,052 --> 00:31:50,794
choosing to not be your daughter.

692
00:31:53,797 --> 00:31:55,886
Oh, honey...

693
00:31:58,933 --> 00:32:01,326
So it was your fault?

694
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:11,510
Are you bitches ready for a puppet show?

695
00:32:22,782 --> 00:32:25,036
- Are you okay?
- Uh-huh.

696
00:32:25,046 --> 00:32:27,647
Oh, my God.

697
00:32:31,835 --> 00:32:33,131
Do that one again.

698
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:02,682
It's over, Jules. Give us the egg.

699
00:33:02,692 --> 00:33:05,032
What part of "I have a gun"
did you forget about?

700
00:33:05,042 --> 00:33:08,166
Back off, or your baby gets it.

701
00:33:08,176 --> 00:33:09,907
Fine.

702
00:33:09,917 --> 00:33:11,778
You gonna hold your arms
out there all night?

703
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,004
Holy fuck.

704
00:33:22,538 --> 00:33:24,573
Why the hell

705
00:33:24,583 --> 00:33:26,053
is everybody yelling?

706
00:33:26,063 --> 00:33:29,013
Oh, I... I sent them
to find your elixir.

707
00:33:29,023 --> 00:33:30,710
It is here, O Ancient One.

708
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,103
In this egg.

709
00:33:32,113 --> 00:33:33,887
It's, um... it's kind of fertilized.

710
00:33:33,897 --> 00:33:35,019
What?

711
00:33:35,029 --> 00:33:38,500
I'm only 12,422.

712
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:41,025
Too young to be a mother.

713
00:33:41,035 --> 00:33:44,038
Wait, how can you hold it like that?

714
00:33:46,127 --> 00:33:48,510
- Here, if you'd just take it...
- It's mine!

715
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,556
I won it off the Seine River Dragon.

716
00:33:50,566 --> 00:33:53,994
This is Amelie's egg?

717
00:33:54,004 --> 00:33:55,909
Is... is that good?

718
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,520
Well, not for Amelie.

719
00:33:58,530 --> 00:34:00,750
In the basket.

720
00:34:01,828 --> 00:34:05,048
- No, no, please! I need it! Please!
- Julie, let's talk about this.

721
00:34:05,059 --> 00:34:06,920
It's not too late
to do the right thing, Julia.

722
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:09,531
No, no...

723
00:34:09,541 --> 00:34:11,055
- My baby!
- No, no, no!

724
00:34:11,065 --> 00:34:12,708
- No, my...
- No, no, no!

725
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:15,494
- Falcor!
- My baby!

726
00:34:15,504 --> 00:34:17,288
Falcor!

727
00:34:21,075 --> 00:34:23,599
Baby...

728
00:34:32,351 --> 00:34:34,169
Thank you, Alice.

729
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:35,922
Truly.

730
00:34:35,933 --> 00:34:37,925
I've arranged
for the increase in rations.

731
00:34:38,053 --> 00:34:39,870
Thank you, as well.

732
00:34:39,881 --> 00:34:42,395
Well, for once,

733
00:34:42,405 --> 00:34:45,311
everyone in this room
has done something good.

734
00:34:45,321 --> 00:34:49,020
Let's enjoy it
for the five seconds it lasts.

735
00:34:54,373 --> 00:34:55,887
Of course.

736
00:34:55,897 --> 00:34:57,236
Sheila.

737
00:34:57,246 --> 00:34:59,727
And, five seconds over.

738
00:35:03,774 --> 00:35:05,331
Alice.

739
00:35:05,341 --> 00:35:07,082
It's good to see you.

740
00:35:08,779 --> 00:35:10,728
Why are you wearing that?

741
00:35:10,738 --> 00:35:12,294
Well, um...

742
00:35:12,304 --> 00:35:13,948
it's because I joined the Order.

743
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:16,255
And on that note...

744
00:35:16,265 --> 00:35:18,126
What the fuck did you do to her?

745
00:35:18,136 --> 00:35:20,660
Nothing, I promise.

746
00:35:20,671 --> 00:35:22,818
- They forced you!
- Alice, please just sit down.

747
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:23,842
No!

748
00:35:23,853 --> 00:35:25,926
It's everything I ever wanted.

749
00:35:25,937 --> 00:35:28,179
- Do you know what they do?
- No, nothing's perfect.

750
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:30,777
- People have died!
- Alice...

751
00:35:31,366 --> 00:35:34,881
what you did for me,
I will always owe you.

752
00:35:34,892 --> 00:35:38,146
But now you should see
what I'm working on.

753
00:35:38,156 --> 00:35:41,454
Alice, I'm helping people.

754
00:35:41,464 --> 00:35:43,108
It's good.

755
00:35:43,118 --> 00:35:45,284
And now you're safe, too, Alice.

756
00:35:45,294 --> 00:35:47,112
As a Junior Librarian, Sheila's book

757
00:35:47,122 --> 00:35:48,722
has been placed in the Poison Room,

758
00:35:48,732 --> 00:35:50,811
where any inconsistencies with your book

759
00:35:50,821 --> 00:35:54,119
will remain undetected.

760
00:35:54,129 --> 00:35:56,131
The beacon, please.

761
00:35:57,741 --> 00:35:59,777
They're not good, okay?

762
00:35:59,787 --> 00:36:01,430
They're compromised. They are the enemy.

763
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,782
Everyone in this room is your ally.

764
00:36:04,792 --> 00:36:06,784
No.

765
00:36:06,794 --> 00:36:09,797
You have to let me go, hon.

766
00:36:30,426 --> 00:36:32,287
How are you?

767
00:36:32,297 --> 00:36:34,202
Well, I, uh...

768
00:36:34,212 --> 00:36:37,292
I didn't get egg fever, so...

769
00:36:37,302 --> 00:36:39,120
I mean, about that.

770
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:43,004
The not knowing
what your deal really is.

771
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,867
Well, whatever it is,
it's useful, right?

772
00:36:46,877 --> 00:36:49,391
I didn't ask that.

773
00:36:49,401 --> 00:36:51,360
I don't know.

774
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:55,876
Q and I, we...

775
00:36:55,886 --> 00:36:57,922
used to be the same.

776
00:36:57,932 --> 00:37:00,359
I mean, we were the same thing.

777
00:37:00,369 --> 00:37:02,448
Magicians?

778
00:37:02,458 --> 00:37:04,015
Human.

779
00:37:04,025 --> 00:37:07,105
And now I'm... I don't know what I am.

780
00:37:07,115 --> 00:37:09,977
Unless a god walks in,
I'm gonna outlive everyone.

781
00:37:09,987 --> 00:37:13,024
Hard to describe what that feels like.

782
00:37:13,034 --> 00:37:14,612
Except alone.

783
00:37:16,211 --> 00:37:18,072
Funny thing about Travelers?

784
00:37:18,082 --> 00:37:21,162
We're not exactly human either.

785
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:23,208
You're alone...

786
00:37:23,218 --> 00:37:25,394
and you're not.

787
00:37:26,787 --> 00:37:29,867
Oh, Jesus.

788
00:37:29,877 --> 00:37:32,391
Oh, please tell me
that Coldwater's egg hangover

789
00:37:32,401 --> 00:37:33,566
is worse than mine.

790
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:40,573
It's just...

791
00:37:40,583 --> 00:37:43,445
I never even thought about
being a mom, you know?

792
00:37:43,455 --> 00:37:45,404
And then I found out and...

793
00:37:45,414 --> 00:37:47,188
You realized you wanted to.

794
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:48,886
Oh, God, no.

795
00:37:48,896 --> 00:37:51,149
I was like, "Hi, field researcher."

796
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:53,151
I let poison things bite me for fun.

797
00:37:53,161 --> 00:37:54,456
No baby.

798
00:37:54,466 --> 00:37:56,241
But I got invited to see

799
00:37:56,251 --> 00:37:58,199
a Haitian Spiketoe mating ritual,

800
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:00,419
and I sorta forgot to,

801
00:38:00,429 --> 00:38:02,073
you know...

802
00:38:02,083 --> 00:38:05,119
ah, fuck euphemisms... abort it.

803
00:38:08,089 --> 00:38:09,558
I'm sorry to hear that.

804
00:38:09,568 --> 00:38:11,386
Thank you.

805
00:38:11,396 --> 00:38:13,606
So I was like, okay,
give it to a nice couple.

806
00:38:13,616 --> 00:38:16,087
Fine. But I am not letting it
cramp my style.

807
00:38:16,097 --> 00:38:17,610
And then the egg,

808
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,003
and the chance to fertilize it...

809
00:38:19,013 --> 00:38:22,006
unprecedented... and...

810
00:38:22,016 --> 00:38:24,922
I basically begged the East River Dragon

811
00:38:24,932 --> 00:38:26,575
to revenge-eat me.

812
00:38:26,585 --> 00:38:30,275
I mean, zero mothering instincts.

813
00:38:30,285 --> 00:38:33,017
Well, maybe it's a...

814
00:38:33,027 --> 00:38:35,454
good thing that you're...

815
00:38:35,464 --> 00:38:36,934
you know, giving it to...

816
00:38:36,944 --> 00:38:38,109
No, no, that's the thing.

817
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:39,937
I thought I had zero.

818
00:38:39,947 --> 00:38:43,114
But then I touched that egg and...

819
00:38:43,124 --> 00:38:45,638
I get it now.

820
00:38:45,648 --> 00:38:47,640
And now I feel it for this, too.

821
00:38:49,173 --> 00:38:51,480
Oh, wow.

822
00:38:52,873 --> 00:38:54,168
Are you sure?

823
00:38:54,178 --> 00:38:55,953
I mean...

824
00:38:55,963 --> 00:38:58,346
unconventional parents
can be awesome, right?

825
00:38:58,356 --> 00:39:00,087
Or shitty.

826
00:39:00,097 --> 00:39:02,263
Think about the weird places it'll...

827
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:05,136
and... and the germs
it'll be exposed to.

828
00:39:05,146 --> 00:39:07,181
Its immune system will be amazing.

829
00:39:07,191 --> 00:39:10,315
And if Mom's a selfish brat, well..

830
00:39:10,325 --> 00:39:13,057
it's not like good parenting
makes great artists, right?

831
00:39:13,067 --> 00:39:14,972
I, um... I think that

832
00:39:14,982 --> 00:39:17,539
you should sleep this off
for just a couple of days.

833
00:39:17,549 --> 00:39:20,238
- Here.
- No, you convinced me.

834
00:39:20,248 --> 00:39:22,980
- Wait, I...
- I'm gonna crush this.

835
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:25,591
Me and Dakota.

836
00:39:25,601 --> 00:39:27,027
Draco.

837
00:39:27,037 --> 00:39:29,213
Misti?

838
00:39:30,998 --> 00:39:34,165
Thank you, Quentin.

839
00:39:34,175 --> 00:39:37,004
Yeah, any time. Yeah.

840
00:39:40,355 --> 00:39:41,999
Is it mine?

841
00:39:43,445 --> 00:39:46,003
No.

842
00:39:46,013 --> 00:39:48,885
Why, did you want it to be?

843
00:39:52,019 --> 00:39:54,369
You think you'll ever be a dad?

844
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:57,623
I hope so.

845
00:39:57,633 --> 00:40:01,235
Cool, 'cause I'm making you
the godfather.

846
00:40:01,245 --> 00:40:02,541
Wait, what?

847
00:40:02,551 --> 00:40:04,282
Okay, I can't drink,
so I need to go make

848
00:40:04,292 --> 00:40:06,719
a 6,000 egg omelet immediately.

849
00:40:20,699 --> 00:40:24,128
At the behest of my mistress.

850
00:40:24,138 --> 00:40:27,218
Thank you. Uh, tell her we all said so.

851
00:40:27,228 --> 00:40:30,395
I also have a message
for the former goddess.

852
00:40:30,405 --> 00:40:32,571
My mistress wishes you good fortune

853
00:40:32,581 --> 00:40:34,268
in recovering your truth.

854
00:40:34,278 --> 00:40:37,315
She advises you not to accept
your current circumstance.

855
00:40:37,325 --> 00:40:40,100
It would we best for you,
and all of our kind,

856
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:43,582
that you make this state
you find yourself in...

857
00:40:43,592 --> 00:40:46,019
temporary.

858
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:47,542
Okay.

859
00:40:47,552 --> 00:40:50,154
Your mistress have any advice
on how I do that?

860
00:40:50,164 --> 00:40:53,070
You must seek The Binder.

861
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,594
She then went on to explain

862
00:40:55,604 --> 00:40:57,465
what that means in elaborate detail?

863
00:41:09,661 --> 00:41:12,331
We're gonna nab this cat bitch
and get you that prophecy.

864
00:41:12,342 --> 00:41:13,304
Thanks, Margo.

865
00:41:13,315 --> 00:41:15,440
And then I'm gonna
slather myself in butter,

866
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:18,443
throw myself at Josh's feet,
and beg for forgiveness.

867
00:41:18,453 --> 00:41:21,228
Um, I mean, I guess
that's one way of apologizing.

868
00:41:21,238 --> 00:41:23,274
I'm gonna marry that man, Fen.

869
00:41:23,284 --> 00:41:26,059
And I want you to give me away.

870
00:41:27,549 --> 00:41:30,107
But you and I aren't really...

871
00:41:30,117 --> 00:41:32,283
Oh, this is a dream.

872
00:41:35,296 --> 00:41:36,471
Hey!

873
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,116
Oops.

874
00:41:39,126 --> 00:41:40,649
Guess I run fast in dreams.

875
00:41:42,129 --> 00:41:45,132
Finally caught you, Napster.

876
00:41:47,612 --> 00:41:49,300
Oh, wow, you're beautiful...

877
00:41:50,833 --> 00:41:53,608
- S-scary.
- Why aren't you waking up?

878
00:41:53,618 --> 00:41:56,133
Little trick from my friend Margo.

879
00:41:56,143 --> 00:41:58,570
Potion called Ambien.

880
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:01,312
I may never wake up.

881
00:42:01,322 --> 00:42:03,401
You found a way so quickly.

882
00:42:03,411 --> 00:42:05,326
This bodes well for your future.

883
00:42:10,157 --> 00:42:11,713
I'm ready.

884
00:42:11,723 --> 00:42:14,248
Tell me.

885
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:19,678
You're not gonna like it.

886
00:42:19,688 --> 00:42:21,810
Like... what?

887
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,203
Your destiny.

888
00:42:23,213 --> 00:42:25,249
Very hard to change.

889
00:42:25,259 --> 00:42:27,860
Last chance to ask me
for someone else's instead.

890
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:30,776
"Someone else's"?

891
00:42:30,786 --> 00:42:32,430
I can do that?

892
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,258
Of course.

893
00:42:34,268 --> 00:42:35,737
What'll it be?

894
00:42:35,747 --> 00:42:38,315
I'm...

895
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:42,222
Margo might need this more than I do.

896
00:42:42,232 --> 00:42:43,876
She rules Fillory, so...

897
00:42:43,886 --> 00:42:45,834
Ah, yes.

898
00:42:45,844 --> 00:42:48,272
The girl raised to marry the king.

899
00:42:48,282 --> 00:42:50,883
Of course you're more worried
about her than yourself.

900
00:42:50,893 --> 00:42:52,885
Let me ask you a question:

901
00:42:52,895 --> 00:42:54,539
Do you value yourself, Fen?

902
00:42:54,549 --> 00:42:55,888
Of course I do.

903
00:42:55,898 --> 00:42:57,542
I...

904
00:42:57,552 --> 00:43:00,197
think I do.

905
00:43:00,207 --> 00:43:01,850
I'm not sure.

906
00:43:03,427 --> 00:43:05,898
I need to, don't I?

907
00:43:05,908 --> 00:43:09,467
What good am I to Fillory if I don't?

908
00:43:09,477 --> 00:43:11,425
Okay.

909
00:43:13,742 --> 00:43:16,517
I want mine.

910
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:18,703
Tell me my destiny.

911
00:43:20,836 --> 00:43:24,177
Your destiny...

912
00:43:24,187 --> 00:43:26,397
concerns High King Margo.

913
00:43:26,407 --> 00:43:28,225
Seriously?

914
00:43:28,235 --> 00:43:29,748
After all that?

915
00:43:29,758 --> 00:43:32,272
A moment will come to protect
the future of Fillory.

916
00:43:32,282 --> 00:43:34,492
A moment to stand beside the High King

917
00:43:34,502 --> 00:43:36,581
before all the leaders of your world...

918
00:43:36,591 --> 00:43:37,843
I can do that.

919
00:43:37,853 --> 00:43:40,715
And then dethrone her.

920
00:43:40,725 --> 00:43:43,178
- Excuse me?
- Violently if necessary.

921
00:43:43,189 --> 00:43:44,963
Take her crown, Fen.

922
00:43:44,974 --> 00:43:47,010
Even if that means

923
00:43:47,021 --> 00:43:49,578
drenching it in her blood.

924
00:43:51,466 --> 00:43:54,511
