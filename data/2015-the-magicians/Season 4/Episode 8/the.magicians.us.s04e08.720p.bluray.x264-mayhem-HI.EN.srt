- Didn't mean to hurt me?

wished me well

not a day ago.

34
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,751
I had a good think
about that, Fen.

- Oh.
- And, uh, these dreams you've been having,

36
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,215
who are they really about?

37
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:36,466
Well, I dreamed of a bunny
with its throat all...

38
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,095
Me, Fen.

39
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,641
- Hmm.
- Talking animals are my constituency,

40
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:45,391
and your next dream was
about my birthright lizard.

41
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:48,105
Oh, I also dreamt about Josh.

00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,934

supposed to be cooking for me.

that, it was, you know,

- We're fine.
- Not fighting?

51
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,166
Fen, Josh is a guy I banged,

52
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,126
and when a woman
of a certain caliber,

53
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,382
and a certain skill set
bangs a guy like Josh,

54
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,886
or basically anyone who
isn't a complete sociopath,

55
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,216

73
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:00,637

my friend Sheila Cozener go.

She hasn't done anything wrong,
just the opposite.

75
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,882
You should get
Zelda to promise

76
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,638
to bury the woman's book,
as well.

77
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:09,266
Otherwise they can
always find her again.

78

And you.

79
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,725
Zelda needs your knowledge
of the Mirror World.

80

Your experience is, well,
exceedingly rare.

89
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:39,383
She didn't want you to.

90
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:42,090
Look, those who go
into the Mirror World

91
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,137
rarely find their
way out, but you did.

92
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,137
- I hoped you could...
- Recap my time as a monster?

93
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,015
Funny. When I offered you
my notes before,

94
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:51,346
you said you had everything.

95
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,933
I didn't know then
how much I didn't know.

96
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:59,107
I went in to find her.
I found something else.

97

but incomplete.

98
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,692

When you're in there
long enough, it refracts you.

101
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,661
Those weren't her,
they were echoes.

102
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,910
You need to track down
the real her,

103
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,586

107
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:25,262
I experimented.

108

to go haywire.

is pull her out.

00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,949
If Zelda has agreed
to your terms, of course.

then bury her book.

extremely cursed.

182
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:56,890
KADY: No.

183
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,309
Okay, this doesn't
look like much,

184
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,057
but legend has it

185
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,479
there's a lot of power
trapped inside.

186
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:05,273
But no one knows
how to crack it open.

187
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,476
Yes, Pete, this is it.

188
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,185
Well, you're not gonna
believe this,

189
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,818
but it's actually in the hoard
of a dragon, which are real.

190
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,942
- Oh, yeah, we know.
- Yeah, I've met three.

191
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,651
Oh, you...

192
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:19,034
Okay. Uh, this dragon,
though, is in New York.

193
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,116
The Hudson tunnels.
Yeah, I've met her.

194
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:22,290
No, East River.

195
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,286
- Ugh.
- Garbage dragon, got it.

196
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,542
So how do we get an audience?

197
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,919
You talk to her herald.

198
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,842
The dragon has an assistant?

199
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,420
9:00 a.m. Bring something
to trade.

200
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,346
Great, so we have
a few hours

201
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,220
to find something
to impress a dragon.

202
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:44,063
There's gotta be
something around here.

203
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:45,606
Your friends are lovely.

204
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,979
Well, after this, we're even.

205
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:53,277
You saved my life, so...
No, not quite.

206
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,441
(LAUGHS) What?
You're surprised?

207
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,994
You thought I was
a complete selfish prick?

208
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,663
What do you really
know about me?

209
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,750
Oh, right.

210
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,167
That I was a fucking
great lieutenant to Marina.

211
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:07,540
What I am is loyal.

212
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,121
To the right person.

213
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,300
- And that's me?
- PETE: Could be.

214
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,049
You ready to graduate
from helping your college buds

215
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,256
to solving a real crisis?

216
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,591
Like what's happening
with the hedges.

217
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,974
When one hedge blows up
a Library branch, shit gets bad.

218
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,680
Who knew?

219
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,523
- Does the Library know who did it?
- No.

220
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,693
So we're all terrorists.

221
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:33,608
They're making
Library cards mandatory,

222
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:34,698
outlawing spells...

223
00:09:34,783 --> 00:09:35,864
You're right.

224
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,319
We gotta do something.
Turn Whitley in.

225
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,573
She did it.

226
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:42,572
She stood here and said

227
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,657
she would make them pay
for killing her boyfriend.

228
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:48,165
They did kill her boyfriend.
They almost killed me.

229
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,292
They deserve to pay.
She did us a favor.

230
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,465
She made life harder
for all of us.

231
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,003
Look, I'm on
the Library's list.

232
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,588
I can't turn her in.

233
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,511
But you can.

234
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,057
Take the heat
off of everyone

235
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,138
until we figure out
what to do next.

236
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:14,065
JULIA: Twenty-three.
Thought you bailed.

237
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:17,865
Just, you know,
figuring some shit out.

238
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,785
So, Shoshana, she...

239
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,237
She get you solved?

240
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,623
Mmm, she's dead.

241
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,996
I'm sorry.
That's heavy.

242
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,498
Yeah, it is.

243
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,295
Still no answers.

244
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,874
No closer to what I am.

245
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,630
And Eliot's still alive,

246
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:40,133
but that means we have
to help The Monster.

247
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:41,885
Which is why I'm drinking.

248
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,091
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

249
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:48,144
I could use a drink, too.

250
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:50,894
I have a real fun message
to deliver.

251
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,728
KADY: Hey.

252
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,233
Where've you been?

253
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,189
PENNY: Timeline jumping.

254
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:03,119
I actually met your Penny.

255
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:08,332
He's, well,
dead, but good.

256
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,836
And he asked me to tell you
that he's sorry.

257
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,672
And he loves you.

258
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,418
In other words,
not coming back, right?

259
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,172
That's...

260
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,182
What am I supposed
to do with that?

261
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:36,185
Truth is, he was pretty
broken up about it.

262
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:39,863
He asked
that you let him go.

263
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,034
He's proud of you.

264
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,120
(SCOFFS)

265
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,413
He knows you're moving on,
taking charge.

You're gonna find
your way and...

268
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,286

269
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:59,212
God, what the fuck
does he know?

270
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,438
Oh! (SIGHS)

271
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:16,483
- Well, this is just what I needed today.
- Hi, Mom.

272
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,063
I went to get a Library card

273
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,614
and they treated me like
the mother of a criminal,

274
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,408
which I guess I am now.

275
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,828
- What did you tell them?
- What is there to tell?

276
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:31,248
I never see you unless
you need something.

277
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,456
It's just a simple
cooperative spell.

278
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,881
And yet you came all this way.

279
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:42,051
Okay, it requires a mother
and a daughter.

280
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,421
Well, you could say "please."

281
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,341
Fine. Please.

282
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,344
I'm afraid we have to
make it quick. I have plans.

283
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,405
Wow, you've really done
a lot with this place.

284
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,823
Well, the Library helped me

285
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:07,447
redo Daniel's
architectural spells

286
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:08,994
and his protection wards.

287
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,821
You mean that crazy
lockdown spell

Dad installed after
he saw <i>The Purge?</i>

289

I'm alone now, Alice.
A defenseless widow.

290
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,498
What's that?

291
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:24,297
The Library put that in after
the Modesto Act of Terror.

292
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,674
Keeps track of magic use.

293
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,050
So you take their handouts,

294
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,723
and in exchange you
let them spy on you?

295
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,142
The gas company keeps
a meter behind the garage.

296
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,561
Are they spying on me?

297
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,310
The Library
saved magic, Alice.

298
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,232
They provide a resource.

299
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,811
Who cares if they keep track
of who uses it?

300
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,736
They gave you
extra magic for that?

301
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,065
You always resented
my flowers.

302
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:50,324
You're both pretty.
You both deserve my attention.

No, no, not until
we've located the item.

call you back.

It has to be now.

I'm Harold, the herald
of the East River Dragon.

00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,496
You are leaving.

358
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:04,044
You did not earn
what you're here to seek.

359
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,042
No, no, no, ignore her.

360
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,374
I will do anything.

361
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:13,967
The vision changes.
You're celebrating.

362
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:18,175
You stand on a stone path
that you will lay.

363
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:24,018
Next to a roof, you re-thatch.
Near a garden, you will plant.

364
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:26,276
So, to get a prophecy

365
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,522
we have to landscape
your yard. Huh?

366
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,734
- Your wish is...
- My command.

367
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:34,743
Small note?

368
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,747
Your whole predicting-what-
we're-gonna-say thing

369
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,949
- is a tad...
- Annoying.

370
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,202
Oh, you're good.

in the Physical Kids cottage?

I've been meaning
to reach out.

Notice you got
magic back. Amazing.

376

They didn't have an appropriate
thank-you card at Target.

377
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,598
So, you got this in Fillory
and used it to rob a dragon?

378
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,399
Uh, no. Why would I? (LAUGHS)

379
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:09,977
Because you're
a dragon-obsessed

who does selfish things

- for personal gain.
- Oh, please.

00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:16,617
Name one example of...
Wait, don't.

383
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,785
I remember.

384
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,612
You're literally dripping
with sweat,

385
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,743
which is usually
a pretty good sign

386
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:23,977
that somebody's
hiding something.

387
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,084
Okay, fine. You caught me.

388
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,040
Happy?

389
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,546
Hello? Q?

00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:40,636
- Anyone?
- QUENTIN: Hey.

What are you?

You were supposed
to be back hours ago.

Kady had to cast a locator.

Somebody moved
this entire cottage.

00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:50,772
Right, uh, sorry.

so complicated.

- Is that chili?
- Yeah.

Before you ask, yes,
it was my tranquilizer dart.

But some douchewad
stole it from me.

405
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,458
I would never
cross a dragon.

00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,043
I'm not an idiot. (CHUCKLES)

00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,928
Um, but what are
you doing here?

408
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:21,177
I needed a place
to gestate,

409

still enrolled, so...

Well, this is some serious
Mr. Miyagi bullshit.

But wasn't Mr. Miyagi
actually training Daniel-san

00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,043
for his big fight
against Cobra Kai?

417
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,796
Do you think we're learning
secret fighting skills?

418
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:59,128
When did you watch
<i>The Karate Kid?</i>

419
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:03,386
Over there, the garden is
overgrown with strangler vines.

420
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,559
Why do you think
we're avoiding that part?

I have seen a vision.

by your hand. Weeds, gone.

- I'm gonna go take care of a weed.

that stole from the dragon.

I don't know,
Q's acting like it's real.

427
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:29,416
He's taking this whole
"father" thing pretty seriously.

428
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,502
He's talking about what
kind of dad he wants to be.

429
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,670
Look at her.

430
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,088

every mental ward.

some shit on him.

he didn't find anything.

be called "Mom."

The reason it's not working

460
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:49,599
is because you would
rather go on a date

that we'd finally be done

00:31:28,637 --> 00:31:31,050
and you'd wash your hands
as a mother, but you didn't.

710
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,057
You still protect me.

711
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,389
In your own way.

712
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:42,478
Which means I was the one
choosing to not be your daughter.

00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:47,687
Oh, honey...

714
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:52,950
So, it was your fault?

I joined The Order.

what your deal really is.

it's useful, right?

- Human.

00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:33,870
I never even thought
about being a mom, you know?

820
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,826
And then I found out and...

821
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,627
You realized you wanted to.

822
00:37:37,714 --> 00:37:39,330

and I sort of forgot to,
you know...

Fuck euphemisms, abort it.

00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:57,024

- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Thank you.

00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:04,022

give it to a nice couple."

Fine. But I am not letting it
cramp my style.

and the chance to fertilize it,

unprecedented, and...

834
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:17,001

to revenge-eat me.

Good thing that you're...

838
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,678
- You know, giving it to...
- No, no, that's the thing.

839
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:30,381
I thought I had zero.

840

that egg and...

00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:35,062
I get it now.

for this, too.

can be awesome, right?

makes great artists, right?

- Okay.

in recovering your truth.

your current circumstance.

any advice on how I do that?

00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,061
MARGO: We're gonna
nab this cat bitch

885
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:03,951
- and get you that prophecy.
- Thanks, Margo.

886
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:06,002
And then I'm gonna
slather myself in butter,

887
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:09,332
throw myself at Josh's feet
and beg for forgiveness.

888
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:12,004
Um, I mean, I guess
that's one way of apologizing.

889
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:13,836
I'm gonna marry that man, Fen.

890
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:16,051
And I want you
to give me away.

891
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,382
Oh. (LAUGHS)

892
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,842
But you and I
aren't really...

893
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,761
Oh, this is a dream.

894
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,150
Hey!

895
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:29,611
Oops!

896
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:31,194
Guess I run fast in dreams.

897
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:34,698
Finally caught you, Napster.

898
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,221
- Oh, wow, you're beautiful...
- (SNARLS)

899
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:41,742
(SNARLS)

900
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,203
- Scary.
- Why aren't you waking up?

901
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:46,876
Little trick from
my friend Margo.

902
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:49,455
Potion called Ambien.

903
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:51,381
I may never wake up.

904
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:54,426
You found a way so quickly.

905
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,923
This bodes well
for your future.

906
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:02,144
I'm ready.

907
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,062
Tell me.

908
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:07,231
(CHUCKLES) Oh.

909
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:09,562
You're not gonna like it.

910
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:12,440
Like what?

911
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,066
Your destiny.

912
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:16,114
Very hard to change.

913
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,692
Last chance to ask me
for someone else's instead.

914
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,652
"Someone else's"?

915
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,539
- I can do that?
- Of course.

916
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:26,168
What'll it be?

917
00:42:26,753 --> 00:42:27,789
I'm...

918
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,047
Margo might need this
more than I do.

919
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,583
She rules Fillory, so...

920
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:35,969
Ah, yes.

921
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,012
The girl raised
to marry the king.

922
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:41,715
Of course you're more worried
about her than yourself.

923
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:42,849
Let me ask you a question.

924
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:45,139
Do you value yourself, Fen?

925
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:46,762
Of course I do.

926
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:49,519
I... Think I do.

927
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:51,943
I'm not sure.

928
00:42:54,447 --> 00:42:56,564
I need to, don't I?

929
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:58,778
What good am I to Fillory
if I don't?

930
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:02,454
Okay.

931
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:07,370
I want mine.

932
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,621
Tell me my destiny.

933
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:12,923
Your destiny

934
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:17,630
concerns High King Margo.

935
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,803
Seriously? After all that?

936
00:43:19,889 --> 00:43:23,053
A moment will come to protect
the future of Fillory.

937
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,929
A moment to stand
beside the High King

938
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:27,595
before all the leaders
of your world...

939
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:30,431
- I can do that.
- And then dethrone her.

940
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:34,185
- Excuse me?
- Violently, if necessary.

941
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,564
Take her crown, Fen.

942
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:40,115
Even if that means
drenching it in her blood.
