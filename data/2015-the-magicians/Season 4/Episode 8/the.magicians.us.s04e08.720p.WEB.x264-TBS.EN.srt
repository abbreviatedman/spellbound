1
00:00:07,228 --> 00:00:09,236
Previously,
on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:09,278 --> 00:00:11,062
To go back to 40, you're gonna want
to turn this dial

3
00:00:11,188 --> 00:00:13,732
three clicks to the right.
Tell Kady I love her.

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,481
Pete?
You're Lovelady?

5
00:00:16,525 --> 00:00:18,314
This is the Black Market?

6
00:00:18,358 --> 00:00:20,167
You'd be surprised
what you can find in here.

7
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:22,941
- Josh, I didn't...
- Didn't mean to hurt me?

8
00:00:22,984 --> 00:00:24,469
Yes, you did.

9
00:00:24,512 --> 00:00:26,869
Believe it or not, I know
exactly who you are, Margo.

10
00:00:26,913 --> 00:00:28,135
- Who's she?
- That's Carol.

11
00:00:28,178 --> 00:00:29,182
That's Carol?

12
00:00:31,321 --> 00:00:33,504
Poppy Kline.
Draconologist,

13
00:00:33,547 --> 00:00:35,337
post-graduate fellow,
and fuel researcher.

14
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:43,062
Hey, who are you?

15
00:00:43,106 --> 00:00:45,376
Why am I having
these stupid dreams?

16
00:00:47,601 --> 00:00:49,042
Harriet?

17
00:00:52,184 --> 00:00:53,320
Sheila Cozener?

18
00:00:53,363 --> 00:00:54,716
You've been a busy girl.

19
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,374
They have my friend Sheila.

20
00:00:56,418 --> 00:00:58,950
I know.

21
00:01:00,303 --> 00:01:03,314
I need your help.

22
00:01:16,714 --> 00:01:19,857
Jesus-based-on-the-novel-
Christ-by-Sapphire.

23
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,733
What... what are you doing here?

24
00:01:21,777 --> 00:01:23,611
I thought you needed some help.

25
00:01:23,654 --> 00:01:25,836
You're welcome, by the way,
for risking regicide.

26
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,626
"Help"?
But you just wished me well

27
00:01:27,669 --> 00:01:31,467
on my... my "solo op"
not a day ago.

28
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,824
I had a good think
about that, Fen.

29
00:01:33,867 --> 00:01:36,748
And, uh, these dreams
you've been having...

30
00:01:36,792 --> 00:01:39,237
who are they really about?

31
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,423
Well, I dreamed of a bunny
with its throat all...

32
00:01:42,466 --> 00:01:44,605
- Me, Fen.
- Hmm.

33
00:01:44,648 --> 00:01:47,268
Talking animals
are my constituency,

34
00:01:47,311 --> 00:01:49,275
and your next dream was about

35
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:51,545
my birthright lizard.

36
00:01:51,588 --> 00:01:54,208
I... I also dreamt about Josh.

37
00:01:54,251 --> 00:01:57,786
Fucking up some shit he was
supposed to be cooking for me.

38
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,402
Sorry, it's...

39
00:01:59,445 --> 00:02:02,588
I just thought that
it was, you know...

40
00:02:02,631 --> 00:02:05,512
my quest.

41
00:02:05,555 --> 00:02:06,865
Okay.

42
00:02:06,908 --> 00:02:09,484
On the off chance,
then I'm your wingwoman.

43
00:02:09,528 --> 00:02:11,928
Right.

44
00:02:11,972 --> 00:02:15,289
I don't mean to pry
but, uh, speaking of Josh...

45
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,475
Are you and he...
We're fine.

46
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:19,567
Not fighting?

47
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,356
Fen, Josh is a guy I banged,

48
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,014
and when a woman
of a certain caliber

49
00:02:23,058 --> 00:02:25,503
in a certain skill set
bangs a guy like Josh...

50
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:27,990
Or basically anyone who isn't
a complete sociopath...

51
00:02:28,034 --> 00:02:30,914
They get a little weird.

52
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:32,573
It'll pass.

53
00:02:32,617 --> 00:02:34,406
Okay, so it's not about...

54
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,501
Fen, don't accuse me

55
00:02:36,545 --> 00:02:38,596
of catching feelings, all right?

56
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,862
It's insulting.

57
00:02:39,906 --> 00:02:41,608
Okay, sorry.

58
00:02:41,652 --> 00:02:43,179
Well, if we're both here,

59
00:02:43,223 --> 00:02:45,013
who'll run the kingdom?

60
00:02:45,056 --> 00:02:46,671
Josh.

61
00:02:49,552 --> 00:02:51,604
Uhh!

62
00:02:51,647 --> 00:02:53,567
Don't forget your little knife.

63
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:58,150
So all of a sudden
you need my help?

64
00:02:58,194 --> 00:03:00,507
Yes, it really must be you.

65
00:03:00,551 --> 00:03:02,777
As long as this doesn't end
with you arresting me.

66
00:03:02,821 --> 00:03:04,654
It won't.

67
00:03:04,697 --> 00:03:06,768
And does end with you letting
my friend Sheila Cozener go.

68
00:03:06,792 --> 00:03:09,106
She hasn't done anything wrong.
Just the opposite.

69
00:03:09,149 --> 00:03:11,507
You should get Zelda
to promise to bury

70
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,990
the woman's book, as well.

71
00:03:13,034 --> 00:03:15,610
Otherwise they can always
find her again.

72
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,267
And you.

73
00:03:17,312 --> 00:03:20,629
Zelda needs your knowledge
of the Mirror World.

74
00:03:20,672 --> 00:03:23,946
Your experience is, well,
exceedingly rare.

75
00:03:25,168 --> 00:03:27,263
Who's in the Mirror World?

76
00:03:27,306 --> 00:03:29,052
Harriet.

77
00:03:29,096 --> 00:03:31,715
The Fuzzbeater...

78
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:34,771
who undermined everything
that you believe in.

79
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:38,044
She's always had
a strong spirit.

80
00:03:38,087 --> 00:03:40,750
Like her mother.

81
00:03:40,794 --> 00:03:42,671
Oh...

82
00:03:42,715 --> 00:03:44,111
I didn't know.

83
00:03:44,155 --> 00:03:46,163
She didn't want you to.

84
00:03:46,206 --> 00:03:48,694
Look, those who go
into the Mirror World

85
00:03:48,738 --> 00:03:50,396
rarely find their way out,
but you did.

86
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,320
I hoped you could...
Recap my time as a monster?

87
00:03:54,194 --> 00:03:56,201
Funny, when I offered you
my notes before,

88
00:03:56,245 --> 00:03:57,686
you said you had everything.

89
00:03:57,729 --> 00:03:59,781
I didn't know then...

90
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:02,181
how much I didn't know.

91
00:04:02,225 --> 00:04:04,014
I went in to find her.

92
00:04:04,058 --> 00:04:05,498
I found something else.

93
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:08,816
Like reflections,
but incomplete.

94
00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:11,216
Wrong, warped.

95
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,180
I called them shards.

96
00:04:13,223 --> 00:04:15,843
When you're in there
long enough, it refracts you.

97
00:04:15,886 --> 00:04:18,374
Those weren't her,
they were echoes.

98
00:04:18,417 --> 00:04:20,469
You need to track down
the real her,

99
00:04:20,512 --> 00:04:21,866
but that'll be a problem.

100
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:23,219
Why?

101
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:25,227
Doing magic in there
is insanely dangerous.

102
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,890
When I was a niffin I...

103
00:04:29,547 --> 00:04:31,512
I experimented.

104
00:04:31,555 --> 00:04:35,047
It's easy for a spell
to go haywire.

105
00:04:35,091 --> 00:04:38,146
Bounce around, kill everything
in its path.

106
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,896
Pretty gruesomely.

107
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,518
What you need to do
is pull her out.

108
00:04:44,562 --> 00:04:47,225
Good.
How?

109
00:04:47,268 --> 00:04:49,407
I might have something.

110
00:04:49,451 --> 00:04:52,332
If Zelda has agreed
to your terms, of course.

111
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,557
Free Sheila, then bury her book.

112
00:04:54,601 --> 00:04:55,911
Yes.

113
00:04:55,954 --> 00:04:58,181
And an extra month's supply

114
00:04:58,224 --> 00:05:01,192
of campus-wide rations
every semester.

115
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:03,679
A month?
That's...

116
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:07,303
Fine.
Agreed.

117
00:05:07,346 --> 00:05:08,524
The spell?

118
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:10,358
It turns an ordinary object

119
00:05:10,402 --> 00:05:13,675
into, well, sort of a beacon.

120
00:05:13,718 --> 00:05:16,600
Relies on very specific
connections between people.

121
00:05:16,643 --> 00:05:18,433
In fact...

122
00:05:18,476 --> 00:05:20,092
the only person in this room

123
00:05:20,135 --> 00:05:22,143
with any shot
of pulling this off

124
00:05:22,187 --> 00:05:24,107
is you, Alice.

125
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,590
What does that mean?

126
00:05:25,635 --> 00:05:27,730
Well, something I suspect
you're not going

127
00:05:27,773 --> 00:05:30,392
to enjoy in the least.

128
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:53,394
It is not
a good morning, America.

129
00:05:53,438 --> 00:05:55,926
Because of you, I stopped
doing anything fun

130
00:05:55,969 --> 00:05:58,414
to this body,
so why is my inside

131
00:05:58,457 --> 00:05:59,941
full of angry ants?

132
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,211
Well, you're probably
going through withdrawal

133
00:06:02,255 --> 00:06:04,655
from drinking, drugs...

134
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:06,183
More drugs would help.

135
00:06:06,226 --> 00:06:07,841
No.

136
00:06:07,885 --> 00:06:09,587
No drugs.
We have a deal.

137
00:06:09,631 --> 00:06:11,595
That you would help me
find a god

138
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,647
and that I wouldn't hurt
this body anymore,

139
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:17,400
but your eyes were closed,
so... not helpful.

140
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:19,670
No deal.

141
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:20,848
Yes, drugs.

142
00:06:20,891 --> 00:06:23,947
No. Look, I found some leads.

143
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:25,387
Okay?

144
00:06:25,432 --> 00:06:27,046
Um...

145
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:29,447
Charlemagne's globus cruciger.

146
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,081
You know, it...
That could have been a...

147
00:06:31,105 --> 00:06:33,637
I give you a mummy
and you give me guesses.

148
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,081
The mandrake god is dead.

149
00:06:36,124 --> 00:06:38,438
Finding his piece
should be easy.

150
00:06:38,482 --> 00:06:41,450
I just need another day.

151
00:06:42,453 --> 00:06:44,374
Please.

152
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,794
There's a man in the TV
who deserves my wrath.

153
00:06:52,929 --> 00:06:55,897
I'll be back
when I'm done with him.

154
00:07:00,872 --> 00:07:02,663
That was not super dignified.

155
00:07:02,706 --> 00:07:04,015
If you have any ideas,

156
00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:07,202
we're looking
for an ancient artifact

157
00:07:07,245 --> 00:07:08,816
that was lost
to the Black Market

158
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,039
a few hundred years ago.

159
00:07:10,082 --> 00:07:12,221
Actually, I...

160
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:15,145
I do know a guy.

161
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:17,153
But...

162
00:07:17,196 --> 00:07:19,161
Julia's not gonna like it.

163
00:07:19,204 --> 00:07:20,558
Pete?

164
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:22,173
He's...

165
00:07:22,216 --> 00:07:23,919
untrustworthy and a creep.

166
00:07:23,962 --> 00:07:26,231
No.
Actually...

167
00:07:26,275 --> 00:07:28,109
I go by Lovelady now.

168
00:07:28,152 --> 00:07:31,120
It's just, we're not really
in a position

169
00:07:31,164 --> 00:07:33,609
to refuse help right now.

170
00:07:33,652 --> 00:07:34,787
Fine.

171
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,624
You guys can deal with Lovelady.

172
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:41,683
I'm getting a drink.

173
00:07:45,088 --> 00:07:47,576
She made Lovelady sound lame.

174
00:07:47,619 --> 00:07:49,234
What'd you find?

175
00:07:49,278 --> 00:07:51,766
Okay...

176
00:07:51,809 --> 00:07:53,380
we have this rock.

177
00:07:53,424 --> 00:07:55,869
Petrifies anything it touches.

178
00:07:55,912 --> 00:07:57,177
Mm-mm.

179
00:07:57,221 --> 00:07:58,967
And I know you
said "stone organ."

180
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:02,896
This is a pipe organ...
Extremely cursed.

181
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:04,729
- No.
- Okay, this doesn't

182
00:08:04,772 --> 00:08:07,260
look like much,
but legend has it

183
00:08:07,303 --> 00:08:09,661
there's a lot of power
trapped inside.

184
00:08:09,704 --> 00:08:11,382
But, uh, no one knows...
Yeah, that's it.

185
00:08:11,406 --> 00:08:13,677
- How to crack it open.
- Yes, Pete, this is it.

186
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,247
Well, you're not gonna
believe this,

187
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,430
but it's actually
in the hoard of a dragon.

188
00:08:17,474 --> 00:08:19,088
Which are real.

189
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:21,053
- Oh, yeah, we know.
- Yeah, I've met three.

190
00:08:21,096 --> 00:08:22,886
Oh, you...

191
00:08:22,929 --> 00:08:26,116
okay, uh, this dragon, though,
is in New York.

192
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,255
The Hudson tunnels.
Yeah, I've met her.

193
00:08:28,298 --> 00:08:29,957
No, East River.

194
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:32,445
- Ugh.
- Garbage dragon, got it.

195
00:08:32,488 --> 00:08:34,496
So how do we get an audience?

196
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,202
You talk to her herald.

197
00:08:37,246 --> 00:08:39,036
The dragon has an assistant?

198
00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:41,829
9:00 a.m.
Bring something to trade.

199
00:08:41,873 --> 00:08:43,924
Great, so we have a few hours
to find something

200
00:08:43,968 --> 00:08:46,499
to impress a dragon.

201
00:08:47,633 --> 00:08:51,125
There's... gotta be something
around here.

202
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,916
Your friends are lovely.

203
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,272
Well, after this we're even.

204
00:08:56,145 --> 00:08:59,069
You saved my life,
so... no.

205
00:08:59,113 --> 00:09:00,641
Not quite.

206
00:09:00,684 --> 00:09:02,430
What, you're surprised?

207
00:09:02,474 --> 00:09:06,228
You thought I was
a complete selfish prick?

208
00:09:06,271 --> 00:09:09,021
What do you really know
about me?

209
00:09:09,065 --> 00:09:10,418
Oh, right... that I was

210
00:09:10,461 --> 00:09:12,382
a fucking great lieutenant
to Marina.

211
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:15,219
What I am is loyal.

212
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,405
To the right person.

213
00:09:18,449 --> 00:09:20,544
- And that's me?
- Could be.

214
00:09:20,587 --> 00:09:23,337
You ready to graduate
from helping your college buds

215
00:09:23,381 --> 00:09:25,519
to solving a real crisis?

216
00:09:25,564 --> 00:09:27,964
Like what's happening
with the hedges.

217
00:09:28,008 --> 00:09:31,412
When one hedge blows up
a Library branch, it gets bad.

218
00:09:31,455 --> 00:09:33,507
Who knew?

219
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,792
Does the Library know
who did it?

220
00:09:34,816 --> 00:09:35,777
No.

221
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,312
So we're all terrorists.

222
00:09:39,356 --> 00:09:41,800
They're making Library cards
mandatory, outlawing spells...

223
00:09:41,843 --> 00:09:43,197
You're right.

224
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,292
We gotta do something.

225
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,824
Turn Whitley in.
She did it.

226
00:09:47,867 --> 00:09:50,835
She stood here and said
she would make them pay

227
00:09:50,878 --> 00:09:52,101
for killing her boyfriend.

228
00:09:52,145 --> 00:09:53,498
They did kill her boyfriend.

229
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:55,506
They almost killed me.

230
00:09:55,549 --> 00:09:58,517
They deserve to pay.
She did us a favor.

231
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,354
She made life harder
for all of us.

232
00:10:01,398 --> 00:10:04,409
Look, I'm on the Library's list.

233
00:10:04,453 --> 00:10:07,465
I can't turn her in.

234
00:10:07,508 --> 00:10:10,738
But you can.

235
00:10:10,782 --> 00:10:12,440
Take the heat off of everyone

236
00:10:12,484 --> 00:10:15,496
until we figure out
what to do next.

237
00:10:18,682 --> 00:10:20,254
23.

238
00:10:20,297 --> 00:10:21,519
Thought you bailed.

239
00:10:21,563 --> 00:10:23,832
Just, you know...

240
00:10:23,876 --> 00:10:25,884
figuring some shit out.

241
00:10:25,927 --> 00:10:29,376
So Shoshana, she...

242
00:10:29,419 --> 00:10:31,297
she get you solved?

243
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,613
Mm, she's dead.

244
00:10:34,657 --> 00:10:36,621
I'm sorry.
That's heavy.

245
00:10:36,665 --> 00:10:37,886
Yeah, it is.

246
00:10:37,931 --> 00:10:39,938
Still no answers.

247
00:10:39,981 --> 00:10:42,382
No closer to what I am.

248
00:10:42,427 --> 00:10:44,041
And Eliot's still alive,

249
00:10:44,084 --> 00:10:47,795
but that means we have
to help The Monster.

250
00:10:47,838 --> 00:10:49,541
Which is why I'm drinking.

251
00:10:53,076 --> 00:10:55,869
I could use a drink, too.

252
00:10:55,913 --> 00:10:58,489
I have a real fun message
to deliver.

253
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:03,334
Hey.

254
00:11:03,377 --> 00:11:04,948
Where've you been?

255
00:11:04,991 --> 00:11:06,737
Timeline jumping.

256
00:11:06,782 --> 00:11:10,710
I actually met your Penny.

257
00:11:12,063 --> 00:11:14,376
He's... he's, well, dead,

258
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,169
but good.

259
00:11:17,213 --> 00:11:20,530
And he asked me to tell you
that he's sorry.

260
00:11:21,796 --> 00:11:24,458
And he loves you.

261
00:11:24,503 --> 00:11:27,164
In other words,
not coming back, right?

262
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,918
That's...

263
00:11:31,966 --> 00:11:34,759
What am I supposed
to do with that?

264
00:11:39,691 --> 00:11:42,092
Truth is, he...

265
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:43,838
was pretty broken up about it.

266
00:11:43,881 --> 00:11:47,635
He asked that you let him go.

267
00:11:50,604 --> 00:11:52,174
He's proud of you.

268
00:11:52,218 --> 00:11:55,098
He knows you're moving on,
taking charge.

269
00:11:55,143 --> 00:11:58,154
You're gonna find
your way and...

270
00:11:59,988 --> 00:12:02,213
Be happy.

271
00:12:04,745 --> 00:12:07,102
God, what the fuck does he know?

272
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,982
Oh.

273
00:12:21,025 --> 00:12:22,771
Well, this is just
what I needed today.

274
00:12:22,815 --> 00:12:24,211
Hi, Mom.

275
00:12:25,957 --> 00:12:27,878
I went to get a Library card

276
00:12:27,922 --> 00:12:30,191
and they treated me like
the mother of a criminal...

277
00:12:30,235 --> 00:12:33,159
Which... I guess I am now.

278
00:12:33,203 --> 00:12:35,734
- What did you tell them?
- What is there to tell?

279
00:12:35,778 --> 00:12:39,095
I never see you
unless you need something.

280
00:12:41,234 --> 00:12:43,242
It's just a simple
cooperative spell.

281
00:12:44,726 --> 00:12:46,777
And yet you came all this way.

282
00:12:46,821 --> 00:12:49,963
Okay, it requires
a mother and a daughter.

283
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:54,285
Well, you could say "please."

284
00:12:54,328 --> 00:12:55,376
Fine.

285
00:12:55,419 --> 00:12:57,209
Please.

286
00:12:57,252 --> 00:12:58,538
I'm afraid we have
to make it quick.

287
00:12:58,562 --> 00:13:00,788
I have plans.

288
00:13:07,728 --> 00:13:09,911
Wow, you've really done
a lot with this place.

289
00:13:09,954 --> 00:13:11,656
Well, the Library helped me redo

290
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,663
Daniel's architectural spells

291
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,584
and his protection wards.

292
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,810
You mean that crazy
lock-down spell Dad installed

293
00:13:17,854 --> 00:13:19,905
after he saw "The Purge"?

294
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:22,045
I'm alone now, Alice.

295
00:13:22,088 --> 00:13:24,401
A defenseless widow.

296
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,806
What's that?

297
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:30,861
The Library put that in after
the Modesto Act of Terror.

298
00:13:30,905 --> 00:13:33,043
Keeps track of magic use.

299
00:13:33,087 --> 00:13:35,008
So you take their handouts,
and in exchange

300
00:13:35,051 --> 00:13:36,710
you let them spy on you?

301
00:13:36,753 --> 00:13:38,718
The gas company keeps a meter
behind the garage.

302
00:13:38,761 --> 00:13:40,987
Are they spying on me?

303
00:13:41,031 --> 00:13:43,780
The Library saved magic, Alice.

304
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:45,701
They provide a resource.

305
00:13:45,745 --> 00:13:48,058
Who cares if they keep track
of who uses it?

306
00:13:48,101 --> 00:13:50,502
They gave you extra magic
for that?

307
00:13:50,545 --> 00:13:52,772
You always resented my flowers.

308
00:13:52,815 --> 00:13:54,780
You're both pretty.

309
00:13:54,823 --> 00:13:56,700
You both deserve my attention.

310
00:13:56,743 --> 00:13:58,184
Jesus Christ, Stephanie.

311
00:13:58,228 --> 00:14:00,124
I don't give a shit about
your stupid ditch weeds.

312
00:14:00,148 --> 00:14:02,942
Lives are at stake.
Let's get started.

313
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,179
I mean, sure it's enchanted,

314
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:10,710
but what's a dragon gonna do
with a human-sized telescope?

315
00:14:10,755 --> 00:14:12,850
I don't know.
I'm all out of baby teeth.

316
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:14,900
Hello?
Yes, we are going to be

317
00:14:14,945 --> 00:14:17,607
delayed indefinitely.
Please hold.

318
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,833
No, no, not until
we've located the item.

319
00:14:19,877 --> 00:14:20,900
I'm gonna have to call you back.

320
00:14:20,924 --> 00:14:22,190
Please hold.

321
00:14:22,234 --> 00:14:24,983
Please hold, I...
This is not a good time.

322
00:14:25,028 --> 00:14:27,340
It has to be now.
You the herald?

323
00:14:27,384 --> 00:14:31,007
I'm Harold, the Herald
of the East River Dragon.

324
00:14:31,051 --> 00:14:33,757
I responded to a confusingly
worded help-wanted ad.

325
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,764
Can we just talk to your boss?

326
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:36,856
We're closed, sir.

327
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:38,034
I... Just come on.

328
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:39,955
We have an emergency.

329
00:14:39,998 --> 00:14:42,224
Regarding an item
that perhaps you've lost,

330
00:14:42,268 --> 00:14:44,276
or someone may have stolen?

331
00:14:44,319 --> 00:14:46,021
Yeah, we could help.
We could find it.

332
00:14:46,065 --> 00:14:47,986
Nice offer, but I doubt you can.

333
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:50,299
Just tell us what got stolen.

334
00:14:50,342 --> 00:14:52,133
Yeah, come on.
We're professionals.

335
00:14:55,842 --> 00:14:59,028
This elixir is worth more
than both of you.

336
00:14:59,072 --> 00:15:00,513
The Great Lady of the East River

337
00:15:00,556 --> 00:15:02,040
will give you
whatever you choose

338
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:04,048
if you recover it.

339
00:15:04,091 --> 00:15:05,532
But you won't.

340
00:15:05,575 --> 00:15:08,980
The thief used this.

341
00:15:09,023 --> 00:15:10,377
It's untrackable.

342
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:13,126
Can I see that?

343
00:15:16,138 --> 00:15:17,535
We can do this.

344
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:19,019
You seem confident.

345
00:15:19,062 --> 00:15:20,305
Yeah, well,
his tracking spell failed

346
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:21,570
because he used
the wrong circumstances.

347
00:15:21,594 --> 00:15:23,141
He didn't know where
the thief got this.

348
00:15:23,165 --> 00:15:25,304
- Which is?
- Fillory.

349
00:15:25,348 --> 00:15:27,486
- Oh.
- Hello? Yes. Right away.

350
00:15:33,946 --> 00:15:35,517
Oh.

351
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:39,227
Are you the lady from...
Your dreams?

352
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:44,203
So you're a prophet?

353
00:15:44,246 --> 00:15:47,695
And a, uh, cat-type person?

354
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:49,616
Did I appear
in your dreams as well?

355
00:15:49,659 --> 00:15:52,190
Wait, you don't know

356
00:15:52,234 --> 00:15:54,155
if you were in my dreams?

357
00:15:54,198 --> 00:15:56,381
It was rhetorical.

358
00:15:58,214 --> 00:16:00,440
You desire your future.

359
00:16:00,484 --> 00:16:03,452
See you're just stating
the obvious.

360
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:06,463
A vision.

361
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,471
You are leaving.

362
00:16:08,515 --> 00:16:11,090
You did not earn
what you're here to seek.

363
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:13,097
No, no, no, ignore her.

364
00:16:13,141 --> 00:16:15,367
I will do anything.

365
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,514
The vision changes.

366
00:16:19,558 --> 00:16:20,824
You're celebrating.

367
00:16:20,867 --> 00:16:23,486
You stand on a stone path

368
00:16:23,529 --> 00:16:26,148
that you will lay.

369
00:16:26,192 --> 00:16:29,378
Next to a roof you re-thatch

370
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,866
near a garden you will plant.

371
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:35,882
So to get a prophecy we have
to landscape your yard, huh?

372
00:16:35,925 --> 00:16:37,235
Your wish is...

373
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:40,202
My command.

374
00:16:40,246 --> 00:16:41,731
Small note?

375
00:16:41,774 --> 00:16:43,627
Your whole predicting-what-
we're-gonna-say thing

376
00:16:43,651 --> 00:16:44,698
is a tad...

377
00:16:44,742 --> 00:16:45,877
Annoying.

378
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:48,278
Oh, you're good.

379
00:16:57,313 --> 00:16:58,971
Poppy.

380
00:16:59,014 --> 00:17:01,415
What are you doing in
the Physical Kids' Cottage?

381
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:04,340
I've been meaning to reach out.

382
00:17:04,383 --> 00:17:06,522
Notice you got magic back.
Amazing.

383
00:17:06,565 --> 00:17:09,665
They didn't have an appropriate
thank-you card at Target.

384
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:13,287
So you got this in Fillory
and used it to rob a dragon?

385
00:17:13,331 --> 00:17:15,731
Uh, no.
Why would I?

386
00:17:15,776 --> 00:17:17,696
Because you're
a dragon-obsessed crazy person

387
00:17:17,739 --> 00:17:19,068
who does selfish things
for personal gain.

388
00:17:19,092 --> 00:17:20,402
Oh, please.

389
00:17:20,445 --> 00:17:23,763
Name one example of...
Wait, don't.

390
00:17:23,807 --> 00:17:25,902
I remember.

391
00:17:25,945 --> 00:17:28,563
You're literally dripping
with sweat, which is a...

392
00:17:28,607 --> 00:17:31,008
Usually a pretty good sign that
somebody's hiding something.

393
00:17:31,052 --> 00:17:34,718
Okay, fine.
You caught me.

394
00:17:36,857 --> 00:17:39,344
Happy?

395
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,666
Hello?

396
00:17:43,709 --> 00:17:45,848
Q?

397
00:17:45,892 --> 00:17:47,856
Anyone?
Hey.

398
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,776
What are...
What are you doing here?

399
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,192
What are you?
You were supposed to

400
00:17:51,217 --> 00:17:52,701
be back hours ago.

401
00:17:52,744 --> 00:17:54,098
Kady had to cast a locator.

402
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:56,716
Somebody moved
this entire cottage.

403
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:57,939
Right, uh, sorry.

404
00:17:57,982 --> 00:18:00,819
Things just got, um,
so complicated.

405
00:18:00,863 --> 00:18:02,914
- Is that chili?
- Yeah.

406
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,660
Will you just give me a...

407
00:18:04,703 --> 00:18:06,887
Will you just excuse me
for a second, um...

408
00:18:11,294 --> 00:18:13,738
- Oh, hey, there.
- Oh, hello.

409
00:18:13,782 --> 00:18:14,786
Belly.

410
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:18,147
Okay, before you ask: Yes, it was
my tranquilizer dart.

411
00:18:18,191 --> 00:18:20,112
But some douchewad
stole it from me.

412
00:18:20,155 --> 00:18:24,302
I would never cross a dragon.
I'm not an idiot.

413
00:18:24,345 --> 00:18:26,135
Um, but what are you doing here?

414
00:18:26,178 --> 00:18:28,186
I needed a place to gestate,

415
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:31,895
and I'm, mm, technically
still enrolled, so...

416
00:18:36,828 --> 00:18:40,320
Julia, we have some news.

417
00:18:40,364 --> 00:18:42,721
I'm going to be a dad.

418
00:18:51,013 --> 00:18:54,331
Well, this is some serious
Mr. Miyagi bullshit.

419
00:18:54,374 --> 00:18:57,081
But wasn't Mr. Miyagi

420
00:18:57,124 --> 00:18:58,826
actually training Daniel-san

421
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,878
for his big fight
against Cobra Kai?

422
00:19:00,921 --> 00:19:03,279
Do you think we're learning
secret fighting skills?

423
00:19:03,322 --> 00:19:06,465
When did you watch
"The Karate Kid"?

424
00:19:06,508 --> 00:19:08,385
Over there,
the garden is overgrown

425
00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:10,000
with Strangler Vines.

426
00:19:10,043 --> 00:19:12,095
Why do you think
we're avoiding that part?

427
00:19:12,139 --> 00:19:13,492
I have seen a vision.

428
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,500
All vines trimmed by your hand.

429
00:19:15,543 --> 00:19:17,551
Weeds, gone.

430
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,051
Where you going?

431
00:19:23,094 --> 00:19:25,888
I'm gonna go take care
of a weed.

432
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,459
It's an act, right?

433
00:19:27,502 --> 00:19:30,296
She's gotta be the one
that stole from the dragon.

434
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,958
I don't know, Q's acting
like it's real.

435
00:19:33,002 --> 00:19:36,057
He's taking this whole "father"
thing pretty seriously.

436
00:19:36,101 --> 00:19:38,196
He's talking about what kind
of dad he wants to be.

437
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,029
I mean, look at her.

438
00:19:40,073 --> 00:19:42,997
She's sketchy on a good day.

439
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,223
Definitely hiding something.

440
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:48,279
I can feel it
through every mental ward.

441
00:19:48,322 --> 00:19:51,247
Bet she cast some shit on him.

442
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,600
Hmm.

443
00:19:52,644 --> 00:19:55,349
Dragon erotica?

444
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:58,187
"The Dragon Riders of Porn."

445
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:00,543
By Poppy Kline.

446
00:20:00,588 --> 00:20:04,778
Oh, number-one best seller
in its category.

447
00:20:04,821 --> 00:20:07,134
Oh, wow.

448
00:20:07,177 --> 00:20:09,535
It's detailed.

449
00:20:09,578 --> 00:20:11,193
The elixir?

450
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,646
I thought Q said
he didn't find anything.

451
00:20:15,689 --> 00:20:18,613
Why is it empty?

452
00:20:23,546 --> 00:20:25,292
It's not glowing, Alice.

453
00:20:25,335 --> 00:20:27,125
I can see that, Stephanie.

454
00:20:27,168 --> 00:20:28,522
Well, that's five tries,

455
00:20:28,565 --> 00:20:30,530
and I am not having
my magic suspended

456
00:20:30,573 --> 00:20:32,144
because of your
thumb-heavy casting.

457
00:20:32,187 --> 00:20:33,759
I'm not thumb-heavy!

458
00:20:33,803 --> 00:20:36,727
It's not your fault that
you inherited Daniel's fingers.

459
00:20:36,771 --> 00:20:38,517
The problem is casting a spell

460
00:20:38,561 --> 00:20:40,263
that requires a connection
with a mother

461
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:41,834
who refuses to be called
"Mom."

462
00:20:41,877 --> 00:20:44,453
Connections take two people,
Alice.

463
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,552
I don't mean to be rude,

464
00:20:47,596 --> 00:20:49,472
but I did tell you
that I had previous plans.

465
00:20:49,516 --> 00:20:51,654
Now you act like I can
just drop everything

466
00:20:51,698 --> 00:20:53,619
for your thick-fingered spells.

467
00:20:53,662 --> 00:20:54,972
The reason it's not working

468
00:20:55,015 --> 00:20:56,475
is because you would rather
go on a date

469
00:20:56,499 --> 00:20:57,610
than help your own daughter.

470
00:20:57,635 --> 00:20:58,900
It's not a date.

471
00:20:58,943 --> 00:21:00,515
It's Carol.

472
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,614
The last time you saw her
you electrocuted her,

473
00:21:03,658 --> 00:21:05,883
so best not test her loyalty.

474
00:21:05,927 --> 00:21:08,633
The Library offers rewards
for fugitives.

475
00:21:08,677 --> 00:21:09,812
Out the back.

476
00:21:13,914 --> 00:21:17,712
I'm not leaving
without my spell.

477
00:21:17,755 --> 00:21:19,720
Nice illusion work, Carol.

478
00:21:19,763 --> 00:21:21,073
You look great.

479
00:21:21,116 --> 00:21:22,993
I mean, you always
look great, I just...

480
00:21:23,037 --> 00:21:25,350
I'm... I'm really sorry
about last time.

481
00:21:25,393 --> 00:21:27,445
Let's just leave it
in the past, shall we?

482
00:21:27,488 --> 00:21:28,930
For what it's worth,

483
00:21:28,973 --> 00:21:31,068
the Library doesn't like me
very much, either.

484
00:21:31,112 --> 00:21:32,072
Why is that?

485
00:21:32,116 --> 00:21:34,603
My new business.

486
00:21:41,194 --> 00:21:43,114
Marital aids.

487
00:21:43,158 --> 00:21:46,519
Your partner feels everything,
even long-distance.

488
00:21:46,562 --> 00:21:48,527
Especially long-distance.

489
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:51,102
Oh. Wow.

490
00:21:51,145 --> 00:21:53,546
Now, who is that?

491
00:21:53,589 --> 00:21:54,856
They work for the Library.

492
00:21:54,899 --> 00:21:56,209
Well, I'll just send them away.

493
00:21:56,252 --> 00:21:57,887
What are they doing here
in the first place?

494
00:21:57,911 --> 00:21:59,002
I don't know what...

495
00:21:59,046 --> 00:22:01,054
You called them on me.

496
00:22:01,097 --> 00:22:02,624
I would never!

497
00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:04,458
Oh, would you just stop
for once, Mother?

498
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:14,017
Bollocks.

499
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,632
No, wh... what did you do?

500
00:22:15,675 --> 00:22:17,310
My dad's Purge protocol.
I locked them out.

501
00:22:17,334 --> 00:22:19,647
And us in.

502
00:22:21,611 --> 00:22:24,973
Aah! Fen!
Fen!

503
00:22:25,016 --> 00:22:27,329
Umber's Balls!
What did you do?

504
00:22:27,373 --> 00:22:30,690
I shoved this bullshit artist
right in the briar patch.

505
00:22:30,733 --> 00:22:33,178
Thought she'd see it coming.
Guess not.

506
00:22:33,221 --> 00:22:35,316
Margo, don't do this.
I'll never get my prophecy.

507
00:22:35,361 --> 00:22:37,237
Yes, free me or no prophecy!

508
00:22:37,281 --> 00:22:40,859
Oh, shut your lie-gina,
you cat-dressing con artist.

509
00:22:40,904 --> 00:22:42,388
How can I save you?

510
00:22:42,431 --> 00:22:44,875
I see some shears

511
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:46,403
in the shed!

512
00:22:46,446 --> 00:22:47,407
Oh.

513
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:49,022
What?

514
00:22:49,066 --> 00:22:50,898
You didn't predict this?

515
00:22:50,942 --> 00:22:52,906
It's all a lie, Fen.

516
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:56,049
She's been using us
to do her shit work.

517
00:22:57,838 --> 00:23:00,719
Oh, my gods.

518
00:23:00,763 --> 00:23:03,033
I deloused this wench's goat.

519
00:23:03,076 --> 00:23:06,045
Okay, I confess!
I lied!

520
00:23:06,088 --> 00:23:08,489
No shit, Benedict Cumber-douche.

521
00:23:08,532 --> 00:23:09,929
But why?

522
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:12,504
Because you people keep coming.

523
00:23:12,548 --> 00:23:15,080
Eating my food and...

524
00:23:15,123 --> 00:23:16,782
And ruining my yard.

525
00:23:16,825 --> 00:23:18,179
We do?

526
00:23:18,222 --> 00:23:20,099
In dreams she appears near here,

527
00:23:20,142 --> 00:23:21,539
so you all come to find her.

528
00:23:21,582 --> 00:23:23,547
And then you force them
to work for you.

529
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,860
I only wanted to repair
what was destroyed

530
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,170
by pilgrims like you.

531
00:23:27,214 --> 00:23:30,574
So the real Green Hood,
what's her deal?

532
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:33,018
A Questing Creature.

533
00:23:33,061 --> 00:23:34,459
She can only be caught
in dreams.

534
00:23:34,503 --> 00:23:35,986
It's tricky.

535
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,906
She is called The Napster.

536
00:23:37,951 --> 00:23:41,005
- "Napster"?
- Like the music-sharing site?

537
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:43,493
I met Sean Parker at an Arby's.

538
00:23:43,538 --> 00:23:47,160
I seriously underestimate you
sometimes, you know that?

539
00:23:47,204 --> 00:23:48,906
Yeah, no, I know that.

540
00:23:48,949 --> 00:23:50,259
Well, not anymore.

541
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,267
I hate Fillory
for making me say this,

542
00:23:52,311 --> 00:23:55,889
but we have to shut down
The Napster.

543
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:04,619
Hey, what are you doing?

544
00:24:04,662 --> 00:24:06,321
Uh...

545
00:24:06,365 --> 00:24:09,333
Poppy wanted to feel like
she was on a beach,

546
00:24:09,377 --> 00:24:12,606
so just... I'm helping her out.

547
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:17,626
Definitely acting normal.

548
00:24:22,034 --> 00:24:25,395
Holy shit.

549
00:24:25,439 --> 00:24:27,970
Guys, I think I've got it.

550
00:24:28,014 --> 00:24:30,851
Yeah, I mean, that's one way
of putting it...

551
00:24:30,895 --> 00:24:32,160
The way the lava's erupting.

552
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:33,688
Don't... don't you get it?

553
00:24:33,732 --> 00:24:36,395
It's the elixir.

554
00:24:38,446 --> 00:24:39,843
- Oh, God.
- Ah!

555
00:24:41,195 --> 00:24:43,029
The elixir is dragon spooge.

556
00:24:43,072 --> 00:24:45,036
Why?
Why would she steal that?

557
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,699
Holy fuck.

558
00:24:47,742 --> 00:24:51,016
So, remember how we said
Quentin was the father?

559
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,151
We lied.

560
00:24:52,194 --> 00:24:53,722
So you're saying you...

561
00:24:53,766 --> 00:24:55,556
Turkey-bastered myself
with dragon semen.

562
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:56,952
No big.

563
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,265
I have a few...
thousand questions.

564
00:24:59,308 --> 00:25:01,884
Think of dragons
as universal sperm donors.

565
00:25:01,928 --> 00:25:04,198
Makes for some
really cool hybrids.

566
00:25:04,241 --> 00:25:05,899
My kid's gonna be epic.

567
00:25:05,944 --> 00:25:08,300
It sounds kind of dangerous.

568
00:25:08,343 --> 00:25:10,134
Do you have any idea
how big it's gonna...

569
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:11,967
Oh, nope.
This is a first.

570
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,626
Historic.

571
00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:15,895
I suggest you back the fuck up.

572
00:25:15,938 --> 00:25:18,339
No one is taking my baby.

573
00:25:18,382 --> 00:25:21,219
Said the world's first
true mama of dragons.

574
00:25:21,264 --> 00:25:22,704
Look, Poppy, I don't know you,

575
00:25:22,748 --> 00:25:24,712
but you're acting kind of...

576
00:25:24,756 --> 00:25:27,025
just trust me when I say
magical pregnancies

577
00:25:27,068 --> 00:25:29,033
can mess with your head.

578
00:25:29,076 --> 00:25:32,088
Especially the people
around you.

579
00:25:34,096 --> 00:25:37,064
Oh, crap.

580
00:25:37,107 --> 00:25:40,861
You know what, hold that...
Two... thought two seconds.

581
00:25:40,905 --> 00:25:42,301
Guys, sidebar?

582
00:25:45,968 --> 00:25:47,932
Dragon fetus.

583
00:25:47,975 --> 00:25:49,766
That's why Q's acting crazy.

584
00:25:49,809 --> 00:25:52,210
Must have some sort
of built-in protection.

585
00:25:52,253 --> 00:25:54,915
It's touch.

586
00:25:59,018 --> 00:26:01,855
So that's dragon pregnancy porn?

587
00:26:01,899 --> 00:26:03,776
Don't kink shame.

588
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:07,006
No, it says here that
dragon babies have a pheromone.

589
00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:10,410
Anything touches them,
it takes over.

590
00:26:10,454 --> 00:26:13,117
Forces them to nurture
so the baby's safe.

591
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,474
So Q touched Poppy's belly,

592
00:26:15,517 --> 00:26:17,263
and now they're nesting.

593
00:26:17,307 --> 00:26:19,096
The hell are we gonna do?

594
00:26:21,061 --> 00:26:22,588
Traveler-proof wards.

595
00:26:22,631 --> 00:26:24,028
Balls.

596
00:26:24,072 --> 00:26:25,949
I'm supposed to be on easy duty.

597
00:26:25,993 --> 00:26:27,433
"Tag 'em and bag 'em,"

598
00:26:27,476 --> 00:26:29,092
not "manage
'a hostage situation,"

599
00:26:29,135 --> 00:26:30,357
for shit's sake.

600
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,059
We know it's
a hostage situation?

601
00:26:32,103 --> 00:26:33,325
Don't be daft.

602
00:26:33,369 --> 00:26:34,654
When people turn in friends
and family,

603
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:36,293
sometimes they take it
a touch personal.

604
00:26:36,336 --> 00:26:38,015
You think she realized
that Stephanie called us?

605
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:40,265
Muhammed, I have no idea.

606
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:42,011
I also don't really give a fuck.

607
00:26:42,055 --> 00:26:46,201
I do. Protocol dictates
that we break in there.

608
00:26:46,245 --> 00:26:48,209
Arrest the fugitive
before anything happens.

609
00:26:48,253 --> 00:26:50,565
Let me know
when you get through the wards.

610
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,094
I'll just be over here.

611
00:26:52,137 --> 00:26:54,668
Wanking.

612
00:26:54,712 --> 00:26:57,593
We can deploy the screamers.

613
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:02,176
You're doing the paperwork.

614
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,577
Alice, I don't know

615
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,672
why they're here, okay?

616
00:27:06,715 --> 00:27:09,683
It's probably just a...
A friendly, routine visit.

617
00:27:09,727 --> 00:27:11,080
Just admit it, Stephanie.

618
00:27:11,124 --> 00:27:12,608
You blame me
for all your problems.

619
00:27:12,651 --> 00:27:14,092
That is not true.

620
00:27:14,135 --> 00:27:15,551
You barely think of me
as a daughter.

621
00:27:15,575 --> 00:27:17,080
The second you had a chance
to turn me in

622
00:27:17,104 --> 00:27:18,214
for your own benefit,
you took it.

623
00:27:18,238 --> 00:27:19,504
No, I didn't!

624
00:27:19,548 --> 00:27:23,345
I... turned in Carol.

625
00:27:23,389 --> 00:27:25,178
What?

626
00:27:25,222 --> 00:27:27,273
Hi, Carol.

627
00:27:33,471 --> 00:27:36,133
We came for the elixir.
The elixir's definitely gone.

628
00:27:36,178 --> 00:27:38,360
We're not getting it back,
so now what?

629
00:27:38,403 --> 00:27:39,713
I don't know.

630
00:27:39,756 --> 00:27:40,910
I guess we gotta find
something else

631
00:27:40,934 --> 00:27:42,768
to give the dragon.

632
00:27:43,903 --> 00:27:47,176
It says here that dragon eggs
take three years to gestate.

633
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,228
So this is informative

634
00:27:49,271 --> 00:27:51,410
dragon pregnancy porn.

635
00:27:51,453 --> 00:27:53,942
Poppy stole the elixir
last week.

636
00:27:53,985 --> 00:27:55,862
Would she be
this pregnant already?

637
00:27:55,905 --> 00:27:56,953
You think she's lying.

638
00:27:56,996 --> 00:27:58,961
Well, it's Poppy.

639
00:27:59,004 --> 00:28:00,794
I mean, what... what sounds real?

640
00:28:00,837 --> 00:28:03,936
A reptile-redhead hybrid
or a lying thief

641
00:28:03,981 --> 00:28:06,250
stashing actual fertilized
dragon eggs somewhere?

642
00:28:06,294 --> 00:28:08,302
I'll beat it out of him.

643
00:28:08,345 --> 00:28:10,004
So you're...

644
00:28:10,047 --> 00:28:13,016
- Normal human pregnant.
- Seriously?

645
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:14,849
How do we ever believe
anything you say?

646
00:28:14,892 --> 00:28:16,376
It's called a misdirect.

647
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,662
Yeah, so that you didn't
find Falcor.

648
00:28:17,686 --> 00:28:18,928
We're not
calling it "Falcor."

649
00:28:18,952 --> 00:28:20,479
Would you please let me have...

650
00:28:20,523 --> 00:28:21,967
Okay, well, how is it
even possible

651
00:28:22,006 --> 00:28:23,578
you used the elixir
to fertilize that?

652
00:28:23,622 --> 00:28:25,586
Duh.
Dragons are just fancy fish.

653
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,725
Spray a load on the egg,
and voila.

654
00:28:27,768 --> 00:28:29,403
Okay, you two have got
the pheromone crazies.

655
00:28:29,427 --> 00:28:31,061
You've touched the egg
and now it's making you

656
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:33,661
do stupid things.

657
00:28:33,704 --> 00:28:35,669
You let go of Falcor!

658
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,823
I will murder you
if you hurt my baby!

659
00:28:36,847 --> 00:28:38,549
Do you understand?

660
00:28:38,593 --> 00:28:41,124
Uh, guys?

661
00:28:41,167 --> 00:28:43,700
Why do I want to lick this egg?
I want to lick this egg.

662
00:28:43,743 --> 00:28:45,795
Oh, that goes away
in a few minutes.

663
00:28:45,838 --> 00:28:47,409
Mm-hmm.

664
00:28:47,454 --> 00:28:50,159
- Oh, boy.
- Egg beats oven mitts, bitch.

665
00:28:50,202 --> 00:28:51,774
Now you're my sister-wife.

666
00:28:51,818 --> 00:28:53,016
Yo, Julia, you want to get
a lick off this egg?

667
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,481
Oh, four parents?

668
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:55,591
I mean, I guess it worked
on "Big Love."

669
00:28:55,615 --> 00:28:56,769
Julia, do not lick that egg!

670
00:28:56,793 --> 00:28:58,059
Don't... don't!

671
00:29:00,067 --> 00:29:03,035
The funny thing is,
magic doesn't work on me

672
00:29:03,078 --> 00:29:04,912
the way it does on you!

673
00:29:04,956 --> 00:29:06,876
Travel or follow us,
and it's eggs over easy,

674
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,923
you hear me?

675
00:29:10,761 --> 00:29:12,856
It's Sam's gun.
The cop.

676
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,995
I kept it.
Smart.

677
00:29:15,038 --> 00:29:17,526
No, no...

678
00:29:18,574 --> 00:29:20,495
Falcor...

679
00:29:33,501 --> 00:29:35,290
The Library won't stop
at screaming books.

680
00:29:35,334 --> 00:29:36,731
We have to find
a way out of here.

681
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:39,612
Or Carol could do
the right thing

682
00:29:39,656 --> 00:29:41,358
and turn herself in.

683
00:29:41,401 --> 00:29:43,627
All I'm doing
is selling intimacy aids.

684
00:29:43,671 --> 00:29:45,329
Oh, please.

685
00:29:45,373 --> 00:29:48,646
Half your customers use them
to punish their enemies.

686
00:29:48,691 --> 00:29:51,135
Carol, voodoo dolls for fucking

687
00:29:51,178 --> 00:29:53,186
are still fucking voodoo dolls.

688
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,193
They are.

689
00:29:55,237 --> 00:29:57,158
Could we use those
on the Librarians outside?

690
00:29:57,201 --> 00:30:01,784
- They require DNA.
- Oh, I have that.

691
00:30:01,828 --> 00:30:04,447
Oh, Jesus Christ, Miss Judgey.

692
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:06,236
I didn't.

693
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:10,208
Not that I wouldn't,
but they were here this morning,

694
00:30:10,252 --> 00:30:12,653
and their mugs are in the sink.

695
00:30:14,704 --> 00:30:17,934
And maybe next time...
you will listen to me.

696
00:30:17,978 --> 00:30:21,819
I have been trying
to get rid of you all day long.

697
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:23,783
The least you could do
is acknowledge

698
00:30:23,827 --> 00:30:25,616
that I didn't turn you in.

699
00:30:25,659 --> 00:30:27,798
You turned in your best friend.

700
00:30:27,842 --> 00:30:30,504
That spell just proves
that we are strangers.

701
00:30:30,548 --> 00:30:32,599
And I am fine with it,
because I wouldn't want

702
00:30:32,643 --> 00:30:34,607
to be related to somebody
who did what you did.

703
00:30:34,651 --> 00:30:36,353
You...

704
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:42,769
Alice, you do not
make this easy.

705
00:30:44,646 --> 00:30:46,872
I know what you're capable of.

706
00:30:46,916 --> 00:30:49,796
Good and bad.

707
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:53,899
But there is nothing
that you could say,

708
00:30:53,943 --> 00:30:56,430
there is nothing
that you could do,

709
00:30:56,475 --> 00:31:00,054
that would make me turn you in.

710
00:31:04,069 --> 00:31:07,343
You are all I have.

711
00:31:14,021 --> 00:31:15,679
Could we try
the mother-daughter spell

712
00:31:15,723 --> 00:31:16,901
one more time?

713
00:31:23,973 --> 00:31:25,936
Why did it work this time?

714
00:31:30,956 --> 00:31:33,138
You and I
never liked each other,

715
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:36,106
and when Dad died, I thought
that we'd finally be done

716
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:38,638
and you'd wash your hands
as a mother, but you didn't.

717
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,696
You still protect me.

718
00:31:42,741 --> 00:31:45,054
In your own way.

719
00:31:45,097 --> 00:31:47,236
Which means I was the one

720
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:50,030
choosing to not be
your daughter.

721
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:55,136
Oh, honey...

722
00:31:58,192 --> 00:32:00,592
So it was your fault?

723
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,805
Are you bitches ready
for a puppet show?

724
00:32:13,948 --> 00:32:16,131
Oh...

725
00:32:16,175 --> 00:32:17,920
Mmm.

726
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:24,336
- Are you okay?
- Uh-huh.

727
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,955
Oh, my God.

728
00:32:31,189 --> 00:32:32,455
Do that one again.

729
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:02,091
It's over, Jules.
Give us the egg.

730
00:33:02,135 --> 00:33:04,449
What part of "I have a gun"
did you forget about?

731
00:33:04,492 --> 00:33:07,591
Back off, or your baby gets it.

732
00:33:07,635 --> 00:33:09,337
Fine.

733
00:33:09,381 --> 00:33:11,213
You gonna hold your arms
out there all night?

734
00:33:17,106 --> 00:33:19,463
Holy fuck.

735
00:33:19,507 --> 00:33:21,994
Sh...

736
00:33:22,038 --> 00:33:24,046
Why the hell

737
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:25,530
is everybody yelling?

738
00:33:25,573 --> 00:33:28,498
Oh, I... I sent them
to find your elixir.

739
00:33:28,542 --> 00:33:30,200
It is here, O Ancient One.

740
00:33:30,244 --> 00:33:31,597
In this egg.

741
00:33:31,641 --> 00:33:33,386
It's, um...
It's kind of fertilized.

742
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:34,521
What?

743
00:33:34,565 --> 00:33:38,013
I'm only 12,422.

744
00:33:38,056 --> 00:33:40,544
Too young to be a mother.

745
00:33:40,588 --> 00:33:43,600
Wait, how can you hold it
like that?

746
00:33:45,695 --> 00:33:48,052
- Here, if you'd just take it...
- It's mine!

747
00:33:48,095 --> 00:33:50,103
I won it off
the Seine River Dragon.

748
00:33:50,147 --> 00:33:53,552
This is Amelie's egg?

749
00:33:53,595 --> 00:33:55,471
Is... is that good?

750
00:33:55,515 --> 00:33:58,091
Well, not for Amelie.

751
00:33:58,134 --> 00:34:00,360
In the basket.

752
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,066
No, no, please!

753
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,658
I need it! Please!
Julie, let's talk about this.

754
00:34:04,682 --> 00:34:06,527
It's not too late
to do the right thing, Julia.

755
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:09,134
No, no...

756
00:34:09,177 --> 00:34:10,661
My baby!
No, no, no!

757
00:34:10,705 --> 00:34:12,320
- No, my...
- No, no, no!

758
00:34:12,363 --> 00:34:15,113
Falcor!
My baby!

759
00:34:15,157 --> 00:34:16,946
Falcor!

760
00:34:20,744 --> 00:34:23,275
Baby...

761
00:34:32,645 --> 00:34:34,435
Thank you, Alice.

762
00:34:34,478 --> 00:34:36,311
Truly.

763
00:34:36,355 --> 00:34:38,319
I've arranged
for the increase in rations.

764
00:34:38,363 --> 00:34:40,152
Thank you, as well.

765
00:34:40,196 --> 00:34:42,684
Well, for once,

766
00:34:42,728 --> 00:34:45,608
everyone in this room
has done something good.

767
00:34:45,652 --> 00:34:49,362
Let's enjoy it
for the five seconds it lasts.

768
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,215
Of course.

769
00:34:56,259 --> 00:34:57,567
Sheila.

770
00:34:57,612 --> 00:35:00,100
And, five seconds over.

771
00:35:04,158 --> 00:35:05,686
Alice.

772
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,476
It's good to see you.

773
00:35:09,178 --> 00:35:11,098
Why are you wearing that?

774
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:12,670
Well, um...

775
00:35:12,713 --> 00:35:14,329
it's because I joined the Order.

776
00:35:14,372 --> 00:35:16,641
And on that note...

777
00:35:16,685 --> 00:35:21,181
- What the fuck did you do to her?
- Nothing, I promise.

778
00:35:21,224 --> 00:35:23,538
- They forced you!
- Alice, please just sit down.

779
00:35:23,581 --> 00:35:26,680
- No!
- It's everything I ever wanted.

780
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:28,621
- Do you know what they do?
- No, nothing's perfect.

781
00:35:28,645 --> 00:35:31,787
- People have died!
- Alice...

782
00:35:31,831 --> 00:35:35,323
what you did for me,
I will always owe you.

783
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:38,596
But now you should see
what I'm working on.

784
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,913
Alice, I'm helping people.

785
00:35:41,957 --> 00:35:43,572
It's good.

786
00:35:43,616 --> 00:35:45,754
And now you're safe, too, Alice.

787
00:35:45,798 --> 00:35:47,587
As a Junior Librarian,
Sheila's book

788
00:35:47,631 --> 00:35:49,203
has been placed
in the Poison Room,

789
00:35:49,246 --> 00:35:51,298
where any inconsistencies
with your book

790
00:35:51,341 --> 00:35:54,614
will remain undetected.

791
00:35:54,659 --> 00:35:56,666
The beacon, please.

792
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:00,289
They're not good, okay?

793
00:36:00,333 --> 00:36:01,948
They're compromised.
They are the enemy.

794
00:36:01,991 --> 00:36:05,308
Everyone in this room
is your ally.

795
00:36:05,352 --> 00:36:07,316
No.

796
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,372
You have to let me go, hon.

797
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,894
How are you?

798
00:36:32,937 --> 00:36:34,814
Well, I, uh...

799
00:36:34,857 --> 00:36:37,913
I didn't get egg fever, so...

800
00:36:37,956 --> 00:36:39,746
I mean, about that.

801
00:36:39,789 --> 00:36:43,675
The not knowing
what your deal really is.

802
00:36:45,115 --> 00:36:47,516
Well, whatever it is,
it's useful, right?

803
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:50,047
I didn't ask that.

804
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:52,055
I don't know.

805
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:56,551
Q and I, we...

806
00:36:56,594 --> 00:36:58,601
used to be the same.

807
00:36:58,646 --> 00:37:01,045
I mean, we were the same thing.

808
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:03,141
Magicians?

809
00:37:03,185 --> 00:37:04,712
Human.

810
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:07,811
And now I'm...
I don't know what I am.

811
00:37:07,855 --> 00:37:10,692
Unless a god walks in,
I'm gonna outlive everyone.

812
00:37:10,735 --> 00:37:13,747
Hard to describe
what that feels like.

813
00:37:13,791 --> 00:37:16,933
Except alone.

814
00:37:16,977 --> 00:37:18,811
Funny thing about Travelers?

815
00:37:18,854 --> 00:37:21,909
We're not exactly human either.

816
00:37:21,953 --> 00:37:23,960
You're alone...

817
00:37:24,005 --> 00:37:26,187
and you're not.

818
00:37:27,584 --> 00:37:30,639
Oh, Jesus.

819
00:37:30,683 --> 00:37:33,170
Oh, please tell me
that Coldwater's egg hangover

820
00:37:33,214 --> 00:37:34,348
is worse than mine.

821
00:37:38,888 --> 00:37:41,375
It's just...

822
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:44,257
I never even thought about
being a mom, you know?

823
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,220
And then I found out and...

824
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:48,011
You realized you wanted to.

825
00:37:48,054 --> 00:37:49,712
Oh, God, no.

826
00:37:49,757 --> 00:37:51,982
I was like,
"Hi, field researcher.

827
00:37:52,026 --> 00:37:53,990
I let poison things
bite me for fun.

828
00:37:54,034 --> 00:37:55,300
No baby.

829
00:37:55,343 --> 00:37:57,089
But I got invited to see

830
00:37:57,133 --> 00:37:59,053
a Haitian Spiketoe
mating ritual,

831
00:37:59,096 --> 00:38:01,279
and I sorta forgot to,

832
00:38:01,323 --> 00:38:02,937
you know...

833
00:38:02,982 --> 00:38:05,993
ah, fuck euphemisms... abort it.

834
00:38:06,036 --> 00:38:08,961
Oh.

835
00:38:09,005 --> 00:38:10,445
I'm sorry to hear that.

836
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:12,278
Thank you.

837
00:38:12,321 --> 00:38:14,504
So I was like, okay,
give it to a nice couple.

838
00:38:14,548 --> 00:38:16,992
Fine. But I am not letting it
cramp my style.

839
00:38:17,036 --> 00:38:18,519
And then the egg,

840
00:38:18,563 --> 00:38:19,916
and the chance to fertilize it...

841
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,928
Unprecedented... and...

842
00:38:22,972 --> 00:38:25,852
I basically begged
the East River Dragon

843
00:38:25,896 --> 00:38:27,511
to revenge-eat me.

844
00:38:27,554 --> 00:38:31,221
I mean,
zero mothering instincts.

845
00:38:31,265 --> 00:38:33,971
Well, maybe it's a...

846
00:38:34,015 --> 00:38:36,415
good thing that you're...

847
00:38:36,459 --> 00:38:37,899
you know, giving it to...

848
00:38:37,943 --> 00:38:39,077
No, no, that's the thing.

849
00:38:39,122 --> 00:38:40,911
I thought I had zero.

850
00:38:40,955 --> 00:38:44,097
But then I touched
that egg and...

851
00:38:44,141 --> 00:38:46,628
I get it now.

852
00:38:46,672 --> 00:38:48,636
And now I feel it for this, too.

853
00:38:50,207 --> 00:38:52,521
Oh, wow.

854
00:38:53,918 --> 00:38:56,973
- Are you sure?
- I mean...

855
00:38:57,017 --> 00:38:59,374
unconventional parents
can be awesome, right?

856
00:38:59,417 --> 00:39:01,120
Or shitty.

857
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:02,349
Think about
the weird places it'll...

858
00:39:02,392 --> 00:39:05,229
And... and the germs
it'll be exposed to.

859
00:39:05,273 --> 00:39:07,281
Its immune system
will be amazing.

860
00:39:07,324 --> 00:39:10,423
And if Mom's
a selfish brat, well..

861
00:39:10,467 --> 00:39:13,173
It's not like good parenting
makes great artists, right?

862
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:15,094
I, um... I think that

863
00:39:15,138 --> 00:39:17,669
you should sleep this off
for just a couple of days.

864
00:39:17,712 --> 00:39:20,375
Here.
No, you convinced me.

865
00:39:20,419 --> 00:39:23,125
- Wait, I...
- I'm gonna crush this.

866
00:39:23,169 --> 00:39:25,743
Me and Dakota.

867
00:39:25,787 --> 00:39:27,184
Draco.

868
00:39:27,228 --> 00:39:29,410
Mm, Misti?

869
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,342
Thank you, Quentin.

870
00:39:34,386 --> 00:39:37,223
Yeah, any time.
Yeah.

871
00:39:40,584 --> 00:39:42,199
Is it mine?

872
00:39:43,683 --> 00:39:46,214
No.

873
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:49,139
Why, did you want it to be?

874
00:39:52,282 --> 00:39:54,638
You think you'll ever be a dad?

875
00:39:56,253 --> 00:39:57,868
I hope so.

876
00:39:57,912 --> 00:40:01,500
- Cool, 'cause I'm making you
the godfather. - Wait, what?

877
00:40:01,627 --> 00:40:03,329
Okay, I can't drink,
so I need to go make

878
00:40:03,373 --> 00:40:05,773
a 6,000 egg omelet immediately.

879
00:40:05,817 --> 00:40:08,174
Oh...

880
00:40:20,612 --> 00:40:24,017
At the behest of my mistress.

881
00:40:24,061 --> 00:40:25,021
Thank you.

882
00:40:25,065 --> 00:40:27,116
Uh, tell her we all said so.

883
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:30,302
I also have a message
for the former goddess.

884
00:40:30,346 --> 00:40:32,484
My mistress wishes you
good fortune

885
00:40:32,529 --> 00:40:34,187
in recovering your truth.

886
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:37,242
She advises you not to accept
your current circumstance.

887
00:40:37,286 --> 00:40:40,036
It would we best for you,
and all of our kind,

888
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,527
that you make this state
you find yourself in...

889
00:40:43,571 --> 00:40:45,972
temporary.

890
00:40:46,015 --> 00:40:47,500
Okay.

891
00:40:47,543 --> 00:40:50,118
Your mistress have any advice
on how I do that?

892
00:40:50,162 --> 00:40:53,043
You must seek The Binder.

893
00:40:53,087 --> 00:40:55,574
She then went on to explain

894
00:40:55,618 --> 00:40:57,451
what that means
in elaborate detail?

895
00:41:09,716 --> 00:41:11,374
We're gonna nab this cat bitch

896
00:41:11,418 --> 00:41:12,835
and get you that prophecy.
Thanks, Margo.

897
00:41:12,859 --> 00:41:15,477
And then I'm gonna
slather myself in butter,

898
00:41:15,521 --> 00:41:18,489
throw myself at Josh's feet,
and beg for forgiveness.

899
00:41:18,533 --> 00:41:21,283
Um, I mean, I guess
that's one way of apologizing.

900
00:41:21,326 --> 00:41:23,334
I'm gonna marry that man, Fen.

901
00:41:23,378 --> 00:41:26,128
And I want you to give me away.

902
00:41:26,171 --> 00:41:27,611
Um...

903
00:41:27,655 --> 00:41:30,186
But you and I aren't really...

904
00:41:30,231 --> 00:41:32,369
Oh, this is a dream.

905
00:41:35,424 --> 00:41:36,603
Hey!

906
00:41:37,956 --> 00:41:39,221
Oops.

907
00:41:39,266 --> 00:41:40,793
Guess I run fast in dreams.

908
00:41:42,277 --> 00:41:45,289
Finally caught you, Napster.

909
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,435
Oh, wow, you're beautiful...

910
00:41:49,479 --> 00:41:50,962
Oh.

911
00:41:51,006 --> 00:41:53,756
- S-scary.
- Why aren't you waking up?

912
00:41:53,799 --> 00:41:56,287
Little trick
from my friend Margo.

913
00:41:56,332 --> 00:41:58,731
Potion called Ambien.

914
00:41:58,776 --> 00:42:01,481
I may never wake up.

915
00:42:01,526 --> 00:42:03,576
You found a way so quickly.

916
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:05,541
This bodes well for your future.

917
00:42:10,386 --> 00:42:11,913
I'm ready.

918
00:42:11,957 --> 00:42:14,489
Tell me.

919
00:42:17,849 --> 00:42:19,900
You're not gonna like it.

920
00:42:19,944 --> 00:42:22,040
Like... what?

921
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:23,437
Your destiny.

922
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,487
Very hard to change.

923
00:42:25,532 --> 00:42:28,106
Last chance to ask me
for someone else's instead.

924
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:31,030
"Someone else's"?

925
00:42:31,074 --> 00:42:32,689
I can do that?

926
00:42:32,733 --> 00:42:34,522
Of course.

927
00:42:34,567 --> 00:42:36,007
What'll it be?

928
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:38,625
I'm...

929
00:42:39,804 --> 00:42:42,510
Margo might need this
more than I do.

930
00:42:42,553 --> 00:42:44,168
She rules Fillory, so...

931
00:42:44,212 --> 00:42:46,133
Ah, yes.

932
00:42:46,176 --> 00:42:48,577
The girl raised
to marry the king.

933
00:42:48,621 --> 00:42:51,195
Of course you're more worried
about her than yourself.

934
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:53,203
Let me ask you a question:

935
00:42:53,247 --> 00:42:54,862
Do you value yourself, Fen?

936
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:56,215
Of course I do.

937
00:42:56,259 --> 00:42:57,874
I...

938
00:42:57,918 --> 00:43:00,536
think I do.

939
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:02,195
I'm not sure.

940
00:43:03,810 --> 00:43:06,254
I need to, don't I?

941
00:43:06,298 --> 00:43:09,833
What good am I to Fillory
if I don't?

942
00:43:09,877 --> 00:43:11,798
Okay.

943
00:43:14,154 --> 00:43:16,904
I want mine.

944
00:43:16,947 --> 00:43:19,130
Tell me my destiny.

945
00:43:21,269 --> 00:43:24,586
Your destiny...

946
00:43:24,629 --> 00:43:26,812
concerns High King Margo.

947
00:43:26,856 --> 00:43:28,645
Seriously?

948
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:30,172
After all that?

949
00:43:30,217 --> 00:43:32,705
A moment will come to protect
the future of Fillory.

950
00:43:32,748 --> 00:43:34,930
A moment to stand
beside the High King

951
00:43:34,974 --> 00:43:37,025
before all the leaders
of your world...

952
00:43:37,069 --> 00:43:38,291
I can do that.

953
00:43:38,335 --> 00:43:41,172
And then dethrone her.

954
00:43:41,215 --> 00:43:42,176
Excuse me?

955
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:43,878
Violently if necessary.

956
00:43:43,922 --> 00:43:45,668
Take her crown, Fen.

957
00:43:45,711 --> 00:43:50,294
Even if that means
drenching it in her blood.
