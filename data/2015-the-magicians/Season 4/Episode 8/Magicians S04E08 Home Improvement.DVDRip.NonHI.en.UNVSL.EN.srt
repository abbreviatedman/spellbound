<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:03,136 --> 00:00:04,536
To go back to 40,
you're gonna want

3
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:06,539
to turn this dial three
clicks to the right.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,664
Tell Kady I love her.

5
00:00:07,774 --> 00:00:10,403
Pete? You're Lovelady?

6
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:12,339
This is the Black Market?

7
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:14,642
You'd be surprised
what you can find in here.

8
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:17,082
Josh, I didn't... Didn't
mean to hurt me?

9
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:18,379
Yes, you did.

10
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:20,977
Believe it or not, I know
exactly who you are, Margo.

11
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:22,054
Who's she?

12
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:23,555
That's Carol. That's Carol?

13
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:27,452
Poppy Kline. Draconologist,

14
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,554
<i>post-graduate fellow
and field researcher.</i>

15
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,232
Hey! Who are you?

16
00:00:37,337 --> 00:00:39,670
Why am I having
these stupid dreams?

17
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,202
Harriet?

18
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:47,506
Sheila Cozener?

19
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:48,947
You've been a busy girl.

20
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,415
They have my friend Sheila.

21
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:51,541
I know.

22
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,580
I need your help.

23
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:14,204
Jesus, based on the
novel Christ, by Sapphire!

24
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:15,902
What? What are you doing here?

25
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:17,568
I thought you needed some help.

26
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,244
You're welcome, by the
way, for risking regicide.

27
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:21,838
Help? But you
just wished me well

28
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,544
on my "solo-op," not a day ago.

29
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,751
I had a good think
about that, Fen.

30
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:30,653
Oh. And, uh, these
dreams you've been having,

31
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,226
who are they really about?

32
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:36,457
Well, I dreamed of a
bunny with its throat all...

33
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:38,092
Me, Fen.

34
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,630
Hmm. Talking animals
are my constituency,

35
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:45,399
and your next dream was
about my birthright lizard.

36
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:48,099
Oh, I also dreamt about Josh.

37
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,939
Fucking up some shit he was
supposed to be cooking for me.

38
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:55,479
Sorry, it's... I just thought
that, it was, you know,

39
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,745
my quest.

40
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:00,716
Okay.

41
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,313
On the off chance, then
I'm your wing woman.

42
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:04,891
Right.

43
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:09,158
I don't mean to pry, but,
uh, speaking of Josh...

44
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:11,497
Are you and he...

45
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,226
We're fine. Not fighting?

46
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,166
Fen, Josh is a guy I banged,

47
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:17,134
and when a woman
of a certain caliber,

48
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,399
and a certain skill set
bangs a guy like Josh,

49
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:21,908
or basically anyone who
isn't a complete sociopath,

50
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,238
they get a little weird.

51
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:26,341
It'll pass.

52
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:28,176
Okay, so it's not about...

53
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:32,116
Fen, don't accuse me
of catching feelings.

54
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,847
All right? It's insulting.

55
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:35,354
Okay. Sorry.

56
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:37,021
Well, if we're both here,

57
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:39,017
who'll run the kingdom?

58
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:40,389
Josh.

59
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:47,290
Don't forget your little knife.

60
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:50,160
Okay.

61
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:52,263
So all of a sudden,
you need my help?

62
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:54,171
Yes, it really must be you.

63
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,607
As long as this doesn't
end with you arresting me.

64
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:57,701
It won't.

65
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:00,645
And does end with you letting
my friend Sheila Cozener go.

66
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:03,047
She hasn't done anything
wrong, just the opposite.

67
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,880
You should get Zelda to promise

68
00:03:04,985 --> 00:03:06,647
to bury the woman's
book, as well.

69
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,280
Otherwise they can
always find her again.

70
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:10,682
And you.

71
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:13,722
Zelda needs your
knowledge of the Mirror World.

72
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:17,729
Your experience is,
well, exceedingly rare.

73
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,361
Who's in the Mirror World?

74
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:22,068
Harriet.

75
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:24,365
The Fuzzbeater?

76
00:03:25,806 --> 00:03:27,638
Who undermined
everything that you believe in.

77
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:31,035
She's always
had a strong spirit.

78
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,843
Like her mother.

79
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:35,581
Oh.

80
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:37,349
I didn't know.

81
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,386
She didn't want you to.

82
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,085
Look, those who go
into the Mirror World

83
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:44,158
rarely find their
way out, but you did.

84
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,126
I hoped you could... Recap
my time as a monster?

85
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:50,020
Funny. When I offered
you my notes before,

86
00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:51,360
you said you had everything.

87
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:54,924
I didn't know then
how much I didn't know.

88
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:59,105
I went in to find her. I
found something else.

89
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,738
Like reflections,
but incomplete.

90
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,710
Wrong, warped.

91
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:06,406
I called them shards.

92
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,415
When you're in there
long enough, it refracts you.

93
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,679
Those weren't her,
they were echoes.

94
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:13,916
You need to track
down the real her,

95
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,580
but that'll be a problem.

96
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:16,689
Why?

97
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,851
Doing magic in there
is insanely dangerous.

98
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,484
When I was a Niffin, I...

99
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,259
I experimented.

100
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:27,901
It's easy for a
spell to go haywire.

101
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:31,697
Bounce around, kill
everything in its path,

102
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,502
pretty gruesomely.

103
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,910
What you need to
do is pull her out.

104
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:39,742
Good. How?

105
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:42,279
I might have something.

106
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,947
If Zelda has agreed to
your terms, of course.

107
00:04:46,386 --> 00:04:47,911
Free Sheila, then bury her book.

108
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:49,286
Yes.

109
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:51,687
And an extra month's supply

110
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:54,523
of campus-wide
rations, every semester.

111
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:55,755
A month? That's...

112
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:01,998
Fine. Agreed. The spell?

113
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:06,472
It turns an ordinary
object into sort of a beacon.

114
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,771
Relies on very specific
connections between people.

115
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:10,867
In fact,

116
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,303
the only person in this room

117
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,439
with any shot
of pulling this off

118
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:17,416
is you, Alice.

119
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,644
What does that mean?

120
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:20,849
Well, something I suspect

121
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:23,480
you're not going
to enjoy in the least.

122
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:46,776
It is not a good
morning, America.

123
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,742
Because of you, I stopped doing

124
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:49,889
anything fun to this body,

125
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:53,353
so why is my inside
full of angry ants?

126
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:54,630
Well, you're probably
going through

127
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:58,182
withdrawal from
drinking, drugs...

128
00:05:58,258 --> 00:05:59,351
More drugs would help.

129
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:00,985
No.

130
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:02,723
No drugs. We have a deal.

131
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,661
That you would
help me find a god,

132
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:06,757
and that I wouldn't
hurt this body anymore,

133
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:10,531
but your eyes were
closed, so not helpful.

134
00:06:10,637 --> 00:06:12,799
No deal.

135
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:13,932
Yes, drugs.

136
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:18,171
No. Look, I found
some leads. Okay?

137
00:06:18,645 --> 00:06:19,806
Um...

138
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,715
Charlemagne's Globus Cruciger

139
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:24,193
You know, it... That
could have been a...

140
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,880
I give you a mummy
and you give me guesses.

141
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,783
The mandrake god is dead.

142
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,521
Finding his piece
should be easy.

143
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:34,561
I just need another day.

144
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,463
Please.

145
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:44,871
There's a man in the TV
who deserves my wrath.

146
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:49,204
I'll be back when
I'm done with him.

147
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,644
That was not super dignified.

148
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,217
If you have any ideas,

149
00:06:57,284 --> 00:07:00,516
we're looking for
an ancient artifact

150
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,055
that was lost to
the Black Market

151
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:03,454
a few hundred years ago.

152
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:05,149
Actually, I...

153
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,022
I do know a guy.

154
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,094
But...

155
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,097
Julia's not gonna like it.

156
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:15,097
Pete? He's

157
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:18,060
untrustworthy and a creep. No!

158
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:21,131
Actually, I go by Lovelady now.

159
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:23,506
It's just, we're not really

160
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,909
in a position to
refuse help right now.

161
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:27,672
Fine.

162
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,580
You guys can deal with Lovelady.

163
00:07:32,152 --> 00:07:33,882
I'm getting a drink.

164
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:40,460
She made Lovelady sound lame.

165
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,395
What'd you find?

166
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,624
Okay...

167
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,461
We have this rock.

168
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,797
Petrifies anything it touches.

169
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:49,993
Mmm-mmm.

170
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:51,901
And I know you
said, "stone organ."

171
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:55,374
This is a pipe organ,
extremely cursed.

172
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:56,868
No.

173
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,309
Okay, this doesn't
look like much,

174
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,073
but legend has it

175
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,479
there's a lot of
power trapped inside.

176
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:05,279
But no one knows
how to crack it open.

177
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:06,479
Yes, Pete, this is it.

178
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,181
Well, you're not
gonna believe this,

179
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:11,850
but it's actually in the hoard
of a dragon, which are real.

180
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,950
Oh, yeah, we know.
Yeah, I've met three.

181
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,655
Oh, you...

182
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:19,028
Okay. Uh, this dragon,
though, is in New York.

183
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:21,124
The Hudson tunnels.
Yeah, I've met her.

184
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,294
No, East River.

185
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,298
Ugh. Garbage dragon, got it.

186
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:27,534
So how do we get an audience?

187
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,905
You talk to her herald.

188
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,842
The dragon has an assistant?

189
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:34,414
9:00 a.m. Bring
something to trade.

190
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,346
Great, so we have a few hours

191
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,213
to find something
to impress a dragon.

192
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:44,051
There's gotta be
something around here.

193
00:08:44,157 --> 00:08:45,591
Your friends are lovely.

194
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,991
Well, after this, we're even.

195
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:53,300
You saved my life,
so... No, not quite.

196
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,458
What? You're surprised?

197
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,994
You thought I was a
complete selfish prick?

198
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:01,667
What do you really
know about me?

199
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:02,741
Oh, right.

200
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:05,175
That I was a fucking
great lieutenant to Marina.

201
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:07,544
What I am is loyal.

202
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:09,115
To the right person.

203
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:13,280
And that's me? PETE: Could be.

204
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,049
You ready to graduate from
helping your college buds

205
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:18,250
to solving a real crisis?

206
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,589
Like what's happening
with the hedges.

207
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:23,993
When one hedge blows up a
Library branch, shit gets bad.

208
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,726
Who knew?

209
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:28,530
Does the Library
know who did it? No.

210
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:30,695
So we're all terrorists.

211
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,600
They're making Library
cards mandatory,

212
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:34,706
outlawing spells...

213
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:35,867
You're right.

214
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,341
We gotta do something.
Turn Whitley in.

215
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,573
She did it.

216
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:42,577
She stood here and said

217
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,675
she would make them
pay for killing her boyfriend.

218
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:48,153
They did kill her boyfriend.
They almost killed me.

219
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:51,281
They deserve to pay.
She did us a favor.

220
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,451
She made life
harder for all of us.

221
00:09:54,027 --> 00:09:57,020
Look, I'm on the Library's list.

222
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,588
I can't turn her in.

223
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:01,527
But you can.

224
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,097
Take the heat off of everyone

225
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:07,130
until we figure out
what to do next.

226
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:14,080
Twenty-three.
Thought you bailed.

227
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:17,879
Just, you know,
figuring some shit out.

228
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:21,783
So, Shoshana, she...

229
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,254
She get you solved?

230
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,618
Mmm, she's dead.

231
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:28,992
I'm sorry. That's heavy.

232
00:10:29,095 --> 00:10:30,495
Yeah, it is.

233
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:32,293
Still no answers.

234
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:34,891
No closer to what I am.

235
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:36,630
And Eliot's still alive,

236
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:40,138
but that means we have
to help The Monster.

237
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,868
Which is why I'm drinking.

238
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:48,142
I could use a drink, too.

239
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,877
I have a real fun
message to deliver.

240
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,748
Hey.

241
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,256
Where've you been?

242
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,189
Timeline jumping.

243
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:03,127
I actually met your Penny.

244
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:08,324
He's, well, dead, but good.

245
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,836
And he asked me to
tell you that he's sorry.

246
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:15,666
And he loves you.

247
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,410
In other words, not
coming back, right?

248
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,175
That's...

249
00:11:24,217 --> 00:11:26,186
What am I supposed
to do with that?

250
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:36,192
Truth is, he was pretty
broken up about it.

251
00:11:36,296 --> 00:11:39,858
He asked that you let him go.

252
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,030
He's proud of you.

253
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:47,401
He knows you're
moving on, taking charge.

254
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:50,534
You're gonna find
your way and...

255
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:53,305
Be happy.

256
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:59,215
God, what the fuck does he know?

257
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,426
Oh!

258
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:16,500
Well, this is just what I
needed today. Hi, Mom.

259
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,063
I went to get a Library card

260
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:22,608
and they treated me like
the mother of a criminal,

261
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:25,406
which I guess I am now.

262
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:27,844
What did you tell them?
What is there to tell?

263
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:31,248
I never see you unless
you need something.

264
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:35,448
It's just a simple
cooperative spell.

265
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,883
And yet you came all this way.

266
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,053
Okay, it requires a
mother and a daughter.

267
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,421
Well, you could say "please."

268
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:48,358
Fine. Please.

269
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:51,367
I'm afraid we have to
make it quick. I have plans.

270
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:03,410
Wow, you've really
done a lot with this place.

271
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:04,815
Well, the Library helped me

272
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:07,443
redo Daniel's
architectural spells

273
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:08,987
and his protection wards.

274
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,818
You mean that
crazy lockdown spell

275
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,824
Dad installed after
he saw <i>The Purge?</i>

276
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:17,825
I'm alone now, Alice.
A defenseless widow.

277
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,498
What's that?

278
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:24,294
The Library put that in after
the Modesto Act of Terror.

279
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,669
Keeps track of magic use.

280
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:28,071
So you take their handouts,

281
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,701
and in exchange you
let them spy on you?

282
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,142
The gas company keeps
a meter behind the garage.

283
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:34,578
Are they spying on me?

284
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:37,310
The Library saved magic, Alice.

285
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:39,215
They provide a resource.

286
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,811
Who cares if they keep
track of who uses it?

287
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:43,720
They gave you
extra magic for that?

288
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,054
You always resented my flowers.

289
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:50,324
You're both pretty. You
both deserve my attention.

290
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,693
Jesus Christ, Stephanie.

291
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:53,642
I don't give a shit about
your stupid ditch weeds.

292
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,861
Lives are at stake.

293
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,367
Let's get started.

294
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:01,632
I mean, sure it's enchanted,

295
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,303
but what's a dragon gonna do
with a human-sized telescope?

296
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:06,903
I don't know. I'm all out of baby teeth.
- Hello?

297
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,505
Yes, we are going to
be delayed indefinitely.

298
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:10,606
Please hold.

299
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,118
No, no, not until
we've located the item.

300
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,263
I'm gonna have to call you back.

301
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:16,483
Please hold. Please hold, I...

302
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:18,354
This is not a good time.

303
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:20,791
It has to be now.
You the herald?

304
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:24,854
I'm Harold, the herald
of the East River Dragon.

305
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,024
I responded to a confusingly
worded help-wanted ad.

306
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,069
Can we just talk to your boss?

307
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,330
We're closed, sir.
I... Just come on.

308
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:33,100
We have an emergency.

309
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,698
Regarding an item
that perhaps you've lost,

310
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,902
or someone may have stolen?

311
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,341
Yeah, we could
help. We could find it.

312
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:41,244
Nice offer, but I doubt you can.

313
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,612
Just tell us what got stolen.
- Yeah.

314
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,150
Come on. We're professionals.

315
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:52,119
This elixir is worth
more than both of you.

316
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,955
The Great Lady of the East River

317
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,358
will give you
whatever you choose

318
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:57,226
if you recover it.

319
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:58,855
But you won't.

320
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:01,730
The thief used this.

321
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:03,735
It's untrackable.

322
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:05,366
Can I see that?

323
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,733
We can do this.

324
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,141
<i>You seem confident.</i>

325
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,355
Yeah, well, his
tracking spell failed

326
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:14,857
because he used the
wrong circumstances.

327
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:16,441
He didn't know
where the thief got this.

328
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:18,017
Which is? Fillory.

329
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,211
Oh.

330
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:20,776
Hello? Yes. Right away.

331
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:27,626
Oh.

332
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:30,797
Are you the lady
from... Your dreams?

333
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,301
So, you're a prophet?

334
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:40,567
And a cat-type person?

335
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,836
Did I appear in
your dreams as well?

336
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:46,572
Wait, you don't know if
you were in my dreams?

337
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:49,480
It was rhetorical.

338
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:53,415
You desire your future.

339
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:56,513
See, you're just
stating the obvious.

340
00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:59,484
A vision.

341
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:01,493
You are leaving.

342
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:04,029
You did not earn what
you're here to seek.

343
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:06,031
No, no, no, ignore her.

344
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,397
I will do anything.

345
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:13,972
The vision changes.
You're celebrating.

346
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:18,169
You stand on a stone
path that you will lay.

347
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:24,010
Next to a roof, you re-thatch.
Near a garden, you will plant.

348
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:26,284
So, to get a prophecy

349
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,514
we have to landscape
your yard. Huh?

350
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:31,718
Your wish is... My command.

351
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,759
Small note?

352
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,747
Your whole predicting-what-
we're-gonna-say thing

353
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:38,958
is a tad... Annoying.

354
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:41,194
Oh, you're good.

355
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:54,273
Poppy. What are you doing
in the Physical Kids cottage?

356
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:56,859
I've been meaning to reach out.

357
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:59,512
Notice you got
magic back. Amazing.

358
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:01,859
They didn't have an appropriate
thank-you card at Target.

359
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:05,583
So, you got this in Fillory
and used it to rob a dragon?

360
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,388
Uh, no. Why would I?

361
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:09,985
Because you're a dragon-obsessed

362
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:11,462
crazy person who
does selfish things

363
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,829
for personal gain. Oh, please.

364
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:16,631
Name one example
of... Wait, don't.

365
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,762
I remember.

366
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,601
You're literally
dripping with sweat,

367
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,732
which is usually
a pretty good sign

368
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:23,986
that somebody's
hiding something.

369
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,070
Okay, fine. You caught me.

370
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,040
Happy?

371
00:17:34,921 --> 00:17:37,550
Hello? Q?

372
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:40,651
Anyone? QUENTIN: Hey.

373
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,592
What are you doing here?

374
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:43,695
What are you?

375
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:45,493
You were supposed
to be back hours ago.

376
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,033
Kady had to cast a locator.

377
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,897
Somebody moved
this entire cottage.

378
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:50,765
Right, uh, sorry.

379
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,567
Things just got so complicated.

380
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:55,733
Is that chili? Yeah.

381
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:56,881
Will you just give me a...

382
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,844
Will you just excuse
me for a second? Um...

383
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,407
Oh, hey, there. Oh, hello.

384
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,948
Belly. POPPY: Okay.

385
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:10,990
Before you ask, yes, it
was my tranquilizer dart.

386
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,888
But some douchewad
stole it from me.

387
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:14,450
I would never cross a dragon.

388
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,051
I'm not an idiot.

389
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:18,922
Um, but what are you doing here?

390
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:21,194
I needed a place to gestate,

391
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:24,237
and I'm, hmm, technically
still enrolled, so...

392
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:32,669
Julia, we have some news.

393
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:36,010
I'm going to be a dad.

394
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:48,087
Well, this is some
serious Mr. Miyagi bullshit.

395
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,154
But wasn't Mr. Miyagi
actually training Daniel-san

396
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:54,062
for his big fight
against Cobra Kai?

397
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,796
Do you think we're
learning secret fighting skills?

398
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:59,134
When did you watch
<i>The Karate Kid?</i>

399
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:03,372
Over there, the garden is
overgrown with strangler vines.

400
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:05,570
Why do you think
we're avoiding that part?

401
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,011
I have seen a vision.

402
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:11,073
All vines trimmed by
your hand. Weeds, gone.

403
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:18,118
Where you going? I'm
gonna go take care of a weed.

404
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:20,989
It's an act, right?

405
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:23,756
She's gotta be the one
that stole from the dragon.

406
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,991
I don't know, Q's
acting like it's real.

407
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:29,433
He's taking this whole
"father" thing pretty seriously.

408
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,502
He's talking about what
kind of dad he wants to be.

409
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:33,664
Look at her.

410
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:35,105
She's sketchy on a good day.

411
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:38,370
Definitely hiding something.

412
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:41,641
I can feel it through
every mental ward.

413
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,307
Bet she cast some shit on him.

414
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,779
Hmm?

415
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:48,047
Dragon erotica?

416
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:51,386
<i>"The Dragon Riders of Porn."</i>

417
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,322
By Poppy Kline.

418
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:57,524
Hmm, number-one
bestseller in its category.

419
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,564
Oh, wow.

420
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:01,827
It's detailed.

421
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:03,802
The elixir?

422
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,450
I thought Q said he
didn't find anything.

423
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:10,204
Why is it empty?

424
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:20,278
It's not glowing, Alice. I
can see that, Stephanie.

425
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:21,752
Well, that's five tries.

426
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:23,846
And I am not having
my magic suspended

427
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:25,323
because of your
thumb-heavy casting.

428
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:26,757
I'm not thumb-heavy!

429
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:30,023
It's not your fault that you
inherited Daniel's fingers.

430
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:31,758
The problem is casting a spell

431
00:20:31,864 --> 00:20:33,492
that requires a
connection with a mother

432
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,194
who refuses to be called "Mom."

433
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,702
Connections take
two people, Alice.

434
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:40,796
I don't mean to be rude,

435
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,738
but I did tell you that
I had previous plans.

436
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:45,038
Now you act like I
can just drop everything

437
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:47,012
for your thick-fingered spells.

438
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,308
The reason it's not working

439
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:49,591
is because you would
rather go on a date

440
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:50,844
than help your own daughter.

441
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,111
It's not a date.

442
00:20:52,218 --> 00:20:53,447
It's Carol.

443
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,783
The last time you saw
her you electrocuted her,

444
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:59,188
so best not test her loyalty.

445
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,887
The Library offers
rewards for fugitives.

446
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:03,088
Out the back.

447
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,231
I'm not leaving
without my spell.

448
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:12,938
Nice illusion work, Carol.

449
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,268
You look great.

450
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:16,637
I mean, you always
look great, I just...

451
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:18,973
I'm really sorry
about last time.

452
00:21:19,078 --> 00:21:20,589
Let's just leave it in
the past, shall we?

453
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,672
For what it's worth,

454
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,807
the Library doesn't like
me very much, either.

455
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,250
Why is that?

456
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:26,751
My new business.

457
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,285
Marital aids.

458
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:39,524
Your partner feels
everything, even long-distance.

459
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,123
Especially long-distance.

460
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:44,033
Oh, wow.

461
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,795
Now, who is that?

462
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:47,831
They work for the Library.

463
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,465
Well, I'll just send them away.

464
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:50,952
What are they doing
here in the first place?

465
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,103
I don't know what...

466
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:54,147
You called them on me.

467
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:55,612
I would never!

468
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,343
Oh, would you just
stop for once, Mother?

469
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:06,986
Bollocks.

470
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:08,526
No, what did you do?

471
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,307
My dad's <i>Purge</i> protocol.
I locked them out.

472
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,498
And us in.

473
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:18,036
Fen! Fen!

474
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:20,663
Umber's Balls! What did you do?

475
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:23,538
I shoved this bullshit
artist right in the briar patch.

476
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:26,202
Thought she'd see
it coming. Guess not.

477
00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:28,781
Margo, don't do this. I'll
never get my prophecy.

478
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:30,680
Yes, free me or no prophecy!

479
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:33,719
Oh, shut your lie-gina,
you cat-dressing con artist.

480
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:35,048
How can I save you?

481
00:22:35,154 --> 00:22:39,023
I see some shears in the shed.

482
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:40,319
Oh.

483
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:41,951
What?

484
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,723
You didn't predict this?

485
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,730
It's all a lie, Fen.

486
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:48,926
She's been using
us to do her shit work.

487
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:52,972
Oh, my gods.

488
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,902
I deloused this wench's goat.

489
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:58,876
Okay, I confess! I lied!

490
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:01,641
No shit, Benedict Cumber-douche.

491
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:02,714
But why?

492
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:05,410
Because you people keep coming.

493
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:07,884
Eating my food

494
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,512
and ruining my yard.

495
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:10,851
We do?

496
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:13,085
In dreams, she
appears near here,

497
00:23:13,192 --> 00:23:14,558
so you all come to find her.

498
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:16,562
And then you force
them to work for you.

499
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:18,858
I only wanted to repair
what was destroyed

500
00:23:18,931 --> 00:23:19,955
by pilgrims like you.

501
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:23,467
So the real Green
Hood, what's her deal?

502
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:25,029
A Questing Creature.

503
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:28,201
She can only be caught
in dreams. It's tricky.

504
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,606
She is called The Napster.

505
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:31,709
"Napster"?

506
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:32,897
Like the music-sharing site?

507
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:35,710
I met Sean Parker at an Arby's.

508
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:39,916
I seriously underestimate
you sometimes, you know that?

509
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:41,681
Yeah, no, I know that.

510
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:43,017
Well, not anymore.

511
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,216
I hate Fillory for
making me say this,

512
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,385
but we have to shut
down The Napster.

513
00:23:57,136 --> 00:23:58,297
Hey, what are you doing?

514
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:02,707
Oh, Poppy wanted to feel
like she was on a beach,

515
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:05,711
so I'm just helping her out.

516
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,442
Definitely acting normal.

517
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:17,313
Holy shit.

518
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:20,148
Guys, I think I've got it.

519
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:24,160
Yeah, I mean, that's
one way of putting it

520
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:25,526
the way the lava's erupting.

521
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:26,963
Don't you get it?

522
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:28,932
It's the elixir.

523
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:32,969
Oh, God. Ah!

524
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,135
The elixir is dragon spooge.

525
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,268
Why? Why would she steal that?

526
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:40,836
Holy fuck.

527
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,442
So, remember how we
said Quentin was the father?

528
00:24:44,283 --> 00:24:45,307
We lied.

529
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:47,108
So you're saying you...

530
00:24:47,186 --> 00:24:49,382
Turkey-bastered myself
with dragon semen. No big.

531
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,617
I have a few thousand questions.

532
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:55,092
Think of dragons as
universal sperm donors.

533
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,356
Makes for some
really cool hybrids.

534
00:24:57,463 --> 00:24:58,988
My kid's gonna be epic.

535
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:01,329
It sounds kind of dangerous.

536
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,464
Do you have any idea
how big it's gonna...

537
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:05,132
Oh, nope. This is a first.

538
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:06,495
Historic.

539
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:08,806
I suggest you back the fuck up.

540
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:10,670
No one is taking my baby.

541
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:14,838
Said the world's first
true mama of dragons.

542
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:17,233
Look, Poppy, I don't know
you, but you're acting kind of...

543
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:20,248
Just trust me when I
say magical pregnancies

544
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,352
can mess with your head.

545
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,482
Especially the
people around you.

546
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,892
Oh, crap.

547
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:33,858
You know what, hold that
thought... Two seconds.

548
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:35,264
Guys, sidebar?

549
00:25:39,438 --> 00:25:40,462
Dragon fetus.

550
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,902
That's why Q's acting crazy.

551
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:45,341
Must have some sort
of built-in protection.

552
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:46,411
It's touch.

553
00:25:52,418 --> 00:25:54,853
So that's dragon pregnancy porn?

554
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,513
Don't kink-shame.

555
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:57,920
No, it says here

556
00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:00,219
that dragon babies
have a pheromone.

557
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:03,490
Anything touches
them, it takes over.

558
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:06,327
Forces them to nurture
so the baby's safe.

559
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:10,267
So Q touched Poppy's
belly, and now they're nesting.

560
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:12,065
The hell are we gonna do?

561
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:15,602
Traveller-proof wards.

562
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:16,932
Balls.

563
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:18,874
I'm supposed to be on easy duty.

564
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:20,344
"Tag 'em and bag 'em,"

565
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,211
not "manage a hostage
situation," for shit's sake.

566
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:25,808
We know it's a hostage
situation? Don't be daft.

567
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,429
When people turn
in friends and family,

568
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:28,997
sometimes they take
it a touch personal.

569
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:30,698
You think she realized
that Stephanie called us?

570
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:33,191
Muhammed, I have no idea.

571
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,920
I also don't really give a fuck.

572
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:38,191
I do. Protocol dictates
that we break in there.

573
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,130
Arrest the fugitive
before anything happens.

574
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:43,464
Let me know when you
get through the wards.

575
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:45,770
I'll just be over
here, planking.

576
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:50,333
We can deploy the screamers.

577
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:54,740
You're doing the paperwork.

578
00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:59,581
Alice, I don't know
why they're here, okay?

579
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:02,985
It's probably just a
friendly, routine visit.

580
00:27:03,088 --> 00:27:04,088
Just admit it, Stephanie.

581
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:05,500
You blame me for
all your problems.

582
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:07,823
That is not true. You barely
think of me as a daughter.

583
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:09,155
The second you had a chance

584
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:11,039
to turn me in for your
own benefit, you took it.

585
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:12,759
No, I didn't!

586
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:14,933
I turned in Carol.

587
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:17,101
What?

588
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,004
Hi, Carol.

589
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:28,771
We came for the elixir.
The elixir's definitely gone.

590
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:30,873
We're not getting it
back, so now what?

591
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,246
I don't know.

592
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,517
I guess we gotta find
something else to give the dragon.

593
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:39,622
It says here that dragon eggs
take three years to gestate.

594
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:41,850
So this is informative

595
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,088
dragon pregnancy porn.

596
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:46,598
Poppy stole the
elixir last week.

597
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,497
Would she be this
pregnant already?

598
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,829
You think she's lying.

599
00:27:49,902 --> 00:27:51,063
Well, it's Poppy.

600
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:53,467
I mean, what sounds real?

601
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:56,771
A reptile-redhead
hybrid or a lying thief

602
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,762
stashing actual fertilized
dragon eggs somewhere?

603
00:27:59,478 --> 00:28:00,639
I'll beat it out of them.

604
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,948
So you're...

605
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:05,416
- Normal human pregnant.
- Seriously?

606
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:07,648
How do we ever
believe anything you say?

607
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:08,719
It's called a misdirect.

608
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,345
Yeah, so that you
didn't find Falcor.

609
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:11,787
We're not calling it "Falcor."

610
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:12,934
Would you please let me have...

611
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:14,035
Okay, well, how
is it even possible

612
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:16,153
you used the elixir
to fertilize that?

613
00:28:16,762 --> 00:28:18,230
Dragons are just fancy fish.

614
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,026
Spray a load on
the egg, and <i>voilà.</i>

615
00:28:20,332 --> 00:28:22,096
Okay, you two have got
the pheromone crazies.

616
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:25,660
You've touched the egg, and
now it's making you do stupid things.

617
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:28,701
You let go of Falcor!

618
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:31,047
I will murder you if you hurt
my baby. Do you understand?

619
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:32,577
Uh, guys?

620
00:28:33,645 --> 00:28:34,885
Why do I want to lick this egg?

621
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:36,108
I want to lick this egg.

622
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:38,717
Oh, that goes away
in a few minutes.

623
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:41,217
Oh, boy.

624
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,664
Egg beats oven mitts, bitch.

625
00:28:42,688 --> 00:28:44,020
Now you're my sister-wife.

626
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:45,600
Julia, you want to
get a lick off this egg?

627
00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:46,751
Ooh, four parents?

628
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:48,069
I mean, I guess it
worked on <i>Big Love.</i>

629
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:49,322
Julia, do not lick that egg!

630
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,394
Don't...

631
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:55,959
The funny thing is,
magic doesn't work on me

632
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:57,195
the way it does on you!

633
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:00,937
Travel or follow us and it's
eggs over easy, you hear me?

634
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,835
It's Sam's gun.
The cop. I kept it.

635
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,402
Smart.

636
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:09,378
No. KADY: Back off.

637
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,440
Falcor.

638
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,338
The Library won't stop
at screaming books.

639
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:29,733
We have to find
a way out of here.

640
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:34,262
Or Carol could do the right
thing and turn herself in.

641
00:29:34,373 --> 00:29:36,774
All I'm doing is
selling intimacy aids.

642
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:37,875
Oh, please.

643
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:41,607
Half your customers use
them to punish their enemies.

644
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,976
Carol, voodoo dolls for fucking
are still fucking voodoo dolls.

645
00:29:46,418 --> 00:29:47,418
They are.

646
00:29:48,253 --> 00:29:49,998
Could we use those on
the Librarians outside?

647
00:29:50,022 --> 00:29:51,388
They require DNA.

648
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:53,815
Oh, I have that.

649
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:57,352
Oh, Jesus Christ, Miss Judgey.

650
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,462
I didn't.

651
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:00,758
Not that I wouldn't,

652
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:02,994
but they were here this morning,

653
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,070
and their mugs are in the sink.

654
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,167
And maybe next time,

655
00:30:09,574 --> 00:30:10,837
you will listen to me.

656
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:14,711
I have been trying to
get rid of you all day long.

657
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,679
The least you could
do is acknowledge

658
00:30:16,782 --> 00:30:18,478
that I didn't turn you in.

659
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,680
You turned in your best friend.

660
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,285
That spell just proves
that we are strangers.

661
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:25,381
And I am fine with it,
because I wouldn't want

662
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,356
to be related to somebody
who did what you did.

663
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:28,859
You...

664
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,133
Alice, you do not
make this easy.

665
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,365
I know what you're capable of.

666
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:41,537
Good and bad.

667
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:46,108
But there is nothing
that you could say,

668
00:30:46,645 --> 00:30:48,511
there is nothing
that you could do,

669
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:52,649
that would make me turn you in.

670
00:30:56,755 --> 00:30:58,656
You are all I have.

671
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:09,229
Could we try the mother-daughter
spell one more time?

672
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,639
Why did it work this time?

673
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:25,848
You and I never
liked each other,

674
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:28,596
and when Dad died, I thought
that we'd finally be done

675
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,055
and you'd wash your hands
as a mother, but you didn't.

676
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:35,054
You still protect me.

677
00:31:35,594 --> 00:31:37,392
In your own way.

678
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:42,501
Which means I was the one
choosing to not be your daughter.

679
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:47,701
Oh, honey...

680
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:52,939
So, it was your fault?

681
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,214
Are you bitches ready
for a puppet show?

682
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:07,391
Oh.

683
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:10,094
Mmm.

684
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:15,299
Are you okay?

685
00:32:15,801 --> 00:32:16,801
Uh-huh.

686
00:32:16,902 --> 00:32:19,201
Oh, my God.

687
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:24,642
Do that one again.

688
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,329
It's over, Jules.
Give us the egg.

689
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,806
What part of "I have a
gun" did you forget about?

690
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:59,935
Back off, or your baby gets it.

691
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:01,775
Fine.

692
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:03,607
You gonna hold your
arms out there all night?

693
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:11,713
Holy fuck.

694
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:12,823
Oh, shit.

695
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,622
Why the hell is
everybody yelling?

696
00:33:18,797 --> 00:33:20,959
I sent them to find your elixir.

697
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:23,297
It is here, O Ancient
One. In this egg.

698
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:25,703
It's, um, kind of fertilized.

699
00:33:25,804 --> 00:33:26,863
What?

700
00:33:26,972 --> 00:33:30,033
I'm only 12,422.

701
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:32,007
Too young to be a mother.

702
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:35,838
Wait, how can
you hold it like that?

703
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:38,206
Um...

704
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:40,080
Here, if you'd just
take it... It's mine!

705
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:42,154
I won it off the
Seine River Dragon.

706
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:45,520
This is Amelie's egg?

707
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,422
Is that good?

708
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:50,056
Well, not for Amelie.

709
00:33:50,295 --> 00:33:52,196
In the basket.

710
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:55,027
No, no, please!

711
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,644
I need it! Please! Julia,
come on. Let's talk about this.

712
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:58,513
It's not too late to do
the right thing, Julia.

713
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:01,063
No, no...

714
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:02,640
My baby. QUENTIN: No, no, no.

715
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,335
No, my... No, no, no.

716
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:07,038
Falcor... My baby.

717
00:34:07,112 --> 00:34:08,876
Falcor!

718
00:34:13,118 --> 00:34:14,245
Baby...

719
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:25,761
Thank you, Alice. Truly.

720
00:34:26,998 --> 00:34:28,694
I've arranged for the
increase in rations.

721
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:30,429
Thank you, as well.

722
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:33,168
Well, for once,

723
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:36,299
everyone in this room
has done something good.

724
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:39,242
Let's enjoy it for the
five seconds it lasts.

725
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:46,577
Of course.

726
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:47,880
Sheila.

727
00:34:47,953 --> 00:34:50,047
And, five seconds over.

728
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,589
Alice. It's good to see you.

729
00:34:59,698 --> 00:35:01,132
Why are you wearing that?

730
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:04,532
Well, it's because
I joined The Order.

731
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:06,869
And on that note...

732
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:11,509
What the fuck did you do
to her? Nothing, I promise.

733
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,738
They forced you. Alice,
please just sit down.

734
00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:16,839
No! It's everything
I ever wanted.

735
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,828
Do you know what they
do? No, nothing's perfect.

736
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:20,909
People have died! Alice,

737
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,413
what you did for me,
I will always owe you.

738
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:28,756
But now you should
see what I'm working on.

739
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:30,990
Alice, I'm helping people.

740
00:35:32,364 --> 00:35:33,525
It's good.

741
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:35,931
And now you're safe, too, Alice.

742
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:37,094
As a Junior Librarian,

743
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:39,137
Sheila's book has been
placed in the Poison Room,

744
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:43,231
where any inconsistencies with
your book will remain undetected.

745
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,635
The beacon, please.

746
00:35:48,213 --> 00:35:50,182
Shiela, they're not good, okay?

747
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:52,079
They're compromised.
They are the enemy.

748
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,314
Everyone in this
room is your ally.

749
00:35:56,121 --> 00:35:57,121
No.

750
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:59,018
You have to let me go, hon.

751
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:23,274
How are you?

752
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:26,876
Well, I didn't get
egg fever, so...

753
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:29,685
I mean, about that.

754
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:33,519
The not knowing
what your deal really is.

755
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,392
Well, whatever it
is, it's useful, right?

756
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:39,129
I didn't ask that.

757
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:40,898
I don't know.

758
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:44,968
Q and I, we...

759
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:48,670
Used to be the same.

760
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,232
I mean, we were the same thing.

761
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:53,902
Magicians? Human.

762
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:57,682
And now I'm... I
don't know what I am.

763
00:36:57,749 --> 00:37:00,514
Unless a god walks in,
I'm gonna outlive everyone.

764
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:02,816
Hard to describe
what that feels like.

765
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:04,855
Except alone.

766
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,591
Funny thing about Travellers,

767
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:10,889
we're not exactly human either.

768
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:14,889
You're alone, and you're not.

769
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:18,736
Oh...

770
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:20,271
Jesus.

771
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:24,433
Oh, please tell me that Coldwater's
egg hangover is worse than mine.

772
00:37:29,347 --> 00:37:30,347
It's just...

773
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:33,878
I never even thought about
being a mom, you know?

774
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:35,853
And then I found out and...

775
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,616
You realized you wanted to.

776
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:39,350
Oh, God, no.

777
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:41,893
I was like, "Hi,
field researcher.

778
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,055
"I let poison things bite
me for fun. No baby."

779
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:48,623
But I got invited to see a
Haitian Spiketoe mating ritual,

780
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:52,067
and I sort of forgot
to, you know...

781
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,971
Fuck euphemisms, abort it.

782
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:57,031
Oh.

783
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:01,274
I'm sorry to hear
that. Thank you.

784
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:04,041
So I was like, "Okay,
give it to a nice couple."

785
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:06,607
Fine. But I am not
letting it cramp my style.

786
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:09,449
And then the egg, and
the chance to fertilize it,

787
00:38:09,554 --> 00:38:12,456
unprecedented, and...

788
00:38:12,557 --> 00:38:16,995
I basically begged the East
River Dragon to revenge-eat me.

789
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:20,088
I mean, zero
mothering instincts.

790
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,562
Well, maybe it's a...

791
00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:25,894
Good thing that you're...

792
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,667
You know, giving it to...
No, no, that's the thing.

793
00:38:28,773 --> 00:38:30,401
I thought I had zero.

794
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:32,501
But then I touched
that egg and...

795
00:38:34,045 --> 00:38:35,069
I get it now.

796
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:38,173
And now I feel it for this, too.

797
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:41,149
Oh, wow.

798
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:45,818
Are you sure? I mean,

799
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:48,952
unconventional parents
can be awesome, right?

800
00:38:49,027 --> 00:38:50,027
Or shitty.

801
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:52,688
Think about the
weird places it'll...

802
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:55,562
And the germs
it'll be exposed to.

803
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,636
Its immune system
will be amazing.

804
00:38:57,702 --> 00:39:00,763
And if Mom's a
selfish brat, well...

805
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:03,502
It's not like good parenting
makes great artists, right?

806
00:39:03,608 --> 00:39:07,340
I, um, think that you
should sleep this off

807
00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:08,971
for just a couple of days. Here.

808
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:10,675
No, you convinced me.

809
00:39:10,782 --> 00:39:13,411
Wait, I... I'm gonna crush this.

810
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,009
Me and Dakota.

811
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:17,487
Draco.

812
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:19,823
Misti?

813
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,060
Thank you, Quentin.

814
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:26,622
Yeah, anytime. Yeah...

815
00:39:31,336 --> 00:39:32,395
Is it mine?

816
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,372
No.

817
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:38,241
Why? Did you want it to be?

818
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:44,372
You think you'll ever be a dad?

819
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:47,584
I hope so.

820
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:51,021
Cool, 'cause I'm making
you the godfather.

821
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,083
Wait, what? Okay.

822
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:57,151
I can't drink, so I need to go make
a 6,000 egg omelet immediately.

823
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:58,858
Oh.

824
00:40:11,676 --> 00:40:13,645
At the behest of my mistress.

825
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:18,011
Thank you. Tell
her we all said so.

826
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,950
I also have a message
for the former goddess.

827
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:24,318
My mistress wishes you good
fortune in recovering your truth.

828
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,881
She advises you not to accept
your current circumstance.

829
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:30,895
It would be best for
you and all of our kind

830
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:34,228
that you make this
state you find yourself in

831
00:40:34,299 --> 00:40:35,392
temporary.

832
00:40:36,968 --> 00:40:40,700
Okay. Your mistress have
any advice on how I do that?

833
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:42,968
You must seek The Binder.

834
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:48,068
She then went on to explain
what that means in elaborate detail?

835
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:02,069
We're gonna nab this cat bitch

836
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:03,959
and get you that
prophecy. Thanks, Margo.

837
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:05,997
And then I'm gonna
slather myself in butter,

838
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:09,329
throw myself at Josh's
feet and beg for forgiveness.

839
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:11,996
Um, I mean, I guess that's
one way of apologizing.

840
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:13,833
I'm gonna marry that man, Fen.

841
00:41:14,372 --> 00:41:16,068
And I want you to give me away.

842
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:18,399
Oh.

843
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,842
But you and I aren't really...

844
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:22,776
Oh, this is a dream.

845
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,150
Hey!

846
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:29,619
Oops!

847
00:41:29,754 --> 00:41:31,188
Guess I run fast in dreams.

848
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:34,687
Finally caught you, Napster.

849
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,069
Oh, wow, you're beautiful...

850
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:44,198
Scary. Why aren't you waking up?

851
00:41:44,302 --> 00:41:46,862
Little trick from
my friend Margo.

852
00:41:46,971 --> 00:41:49,463
Potion called Ambien.

853
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,372
I may never wake up.

854
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:54,443
You found a way so quickly.

855
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,946
This bodes well for your future.

856
00:42:01,152 --> 00:42:02,152
I'm ready.

857
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:05,053
Tell me.

858
00:42:05,156 --> 00:42:07,216
Oh.

859
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:09,550
You're not gonna like it.

860
00:42:10,795 --> 00:42:12,457
Like what?

861
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,055
Your destiny.

862
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:16,134
Very hard to change.

863
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,692
Last chance to ask me
for someone else's instead.

864
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,671
"Someone else's"?

865
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:24,542
I can do that? Of course.

866
00:42:25,176 --> 00:42:26,176
What'll it be?

867
00:42:26,744 --> 00:42:27,803
I'm...

868
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:32,040
Margo might need
this more than I do.

869
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,583
She rules Fillory, so...

870
00:42:34,986 --> 00:42:35,986
Ah, yes.

871
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:39,015
The girl raised
to marry the king.

872
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:41,719
Of course you're more
worried about her than yourself.

873
00:42:41,826 --> 00:42:42,866
Let me ask you a question.

874
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:45,159
Do you value yourself, Fen?

875
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:46,757
Of course I do.

876
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:49,527
I... Think I do.

877
00:42:50,935 --> 00:42:51,935
I'm not sure.

878
00:42:54,439 --> 00:42:56,567
I need to, don't I?

879
00:42:57,008 --> 00:42:58,772
What good am I
to Fillory if I don't?

880
00:43:01,446 --> 00:43:02,446
Okay.

881
00:43:04,849 --> 00:43:07,375
I want mine.

882
00:43:07,452 --> 00:43:08,613
Tell me my destiny.

883
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:12,923
Your destiny

884
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,622
concerns High King Margo.

885
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:19,788
Seriously? After all that?

886
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:23,061
A moment will come to
protect the future of Fillory.

887
00:43:23,134 --> 00:43:24,932
A moment to stand
beside the High King

888
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:27,600
before all the
leaders of your world...

889
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:30,436
I can do that. And
then dethrone her.

890
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:34,210
Excuse me?
Violently, if necessary.

891
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,576
Take her crown, Fen.

892
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:40,115
Even if that means
drenching it in her blood.
