1
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,758
Previously, on The Magicians.

2
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,718
…and when the moment comes, do it.

3
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:13,138
Mayakovsky told you what your discipline is?

4
00:00:13,222 --> 00:00:16,933
Repair of small objects.

5
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,519
You did always excel at minor mendings.

6
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:22,313
- I want you in my life.
- I want that, too.

7
00:00:22,397 --> 00:00:25,817
The Binder knew Julia had many questions.
He knew the answer.

8
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:27,902
So you can help me become a goddess again.

9
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:30,447
You’re hoarding magic.
Trying to become a god.

10
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:33,658
By becoming one of them,
I can rip their secrets away from them.

11
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:36,327
I redirected the power
I need into a reservoir.

12
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,621
You’re saying Josh is a fucking fish?

13
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,957
This should fix the whole fish deal.
I’ll bring Eliot back.

14
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,293
My sister. I need to find her a body.

15
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:45,754
- So The Monster took Julia?
- We need to find them.

16
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:48,256
We have the axes and the demon bottles.
You have the incorporate bond.

17
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,383
Casting an incorporate bond
strong enough to hold a god

18
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,969
would take an insane amount of power.

19
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,346
The question is, who put us here?

20
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,431
Our parents.

21
00:00:56,515 --> 00:00:59,559
They’re more vulnerable than you think,
if we can get to their realm.

22
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:01,895
We had a key. A scroll.

23
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:04,231
Julia, if you’re in there. I’m sorry.

24
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:09,736
Hey. Monster lady.

25
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:22,040
Adorable. So determined.

26
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:23,834
Maybe I’ll keep you as pets.

27
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,804
Then again, I like my pets strong.

28
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:38,473
And you’re weak. You're already fading.
Aren't you?

29
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:59,619
It worked. Q, the bond.

30
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,746
I don’t know how long
that’s going to hold.

31
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,665
We need to get to Brakebills,
I have something that can help.

32
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:05,667
- We need to get her help.
- Wait, where's Eliot?

33
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:07,794
We can’t. We don’t have enough.
We have to go back to the Reservoir.

34
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,337
After we get her to a doctor.

35
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:11,131
No, he’s right. Go to the reservoir.

36
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:12,716
She's right.

37
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:19,097
Always gotta be a fuckin' twist.

38
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,406
In my office. Under the desk, trap door…

39
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,075
Popper twenty-two to unlock.
Don't put your hand in there.

40
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:43,163
Temperature’s at absolute zero.
Should slow her down a bit. Go.

41
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:46,291
You okay?

42
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:49,335
You wanna hurry that up?

43
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,337
Give her something for pain at least.

44
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,048
Yeah, I just did. Twice.

45
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:57,010
- Damn it.
- Here. My last one. Use it on her.

46
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,387
- You’re going to be okay. Stay with me.
- Thank you, Henry.

47
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:01,181
Restraints please?

48
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:03,558
You’re okay.

49
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:06,394
- What’s happening to her?
- So, her body, which is very weird,

50
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,688
it keeps trying to close the wound.
Which is heavily enchanted

51
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:10,190
because the weapon was also very weird.

52
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:13,234
- It tears itself right back open again.
- Well, make it stop.

53
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,737
I hadn't thought of that.
Thank you.

54
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:18,364
I will use this to keep her comfortable.
And…

55
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,866
How long is she gonna be like this?

56
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,077
We are not in what I would call
charted territory right now.

57
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:29,334
I think I might know someone.

58
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:31,586
It was a difficult choice
for Penny Twenty-three,

59
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,296
to even call upon The Binder.

60
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,675
The Binder was certain, however, Penny
Twenty-three had made the right choice.

61
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,427
Julia, The Binder explained…

62
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:44,140
would remain in a cycle of wounding,
agony, for millennia.

63
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,685
Her body required transformation.

64
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:54,568
Luckily, this was The Binder's expertise.

65
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,362
Well, great. Let's get on with it.

66
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:58,780
The Binder needed direction.

67
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:03,284
Initiate her long and arduous
journey to full goddesshood,

68
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:06,079
or revert her body to that
of a mere human?

69
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,004
If it was up to me,
that would be a no-brainer.

70
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,296
Yeah, but it's not.

71
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,005
And it should be her choice.

72
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:21,470
The Binder paused for Julia
to make that choice.

73
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:27,851
Then dryly noted
she wasn’t in a talking mood.

74
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,981
The Binder assumed he was speaking
with her husband or master?

75
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:34,816
No. No.

76
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,734
And yet the decision had to be made.

77
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:41,323
Surely not, the Binder reasoned,
by this spinster nursemaid.

78
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,576
I run this hospital, book.

79
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,661
Still, the Binder replied,

80
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:49,873
stating the obvious
to the strident female,

81
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,834
someone needed to choose for Julia.

82
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,503
Reed’s mark.

83
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:58,423
Best of bad options. Damage was done.

84
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:03,470
I'd rather not die
so it's fine on that level.

85
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:05,722
But also…

86
00:05:06,682 --> 00:05:10,769
Look, I’ve no interest in being
Batman, but there comes a point

87
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:13,980
when even selfish bros need to mobilize.

88
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,441
Six Hedges in the last forty-eight hours

89
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:19,235
were pulled into vans
by men wearing grey.

90
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,572
- Woke up at home, with Reed's Marks.
- Jesus.

91
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,533
The Library has stopped pretending.

92
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:28,370
They're rounding us up.
We need you.

93
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,710
You know what I wanted
to do with my life?

94
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:37,087
To be?

95
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,050
Penny's goddamn girlfriend.

96
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:47,639
I acted tough, but all I wanted was him.

97
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:49,600
You're human.

98
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:52,519
I'm weak.

99
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:56,148
Kady, die when less people need you.

100
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:08,326
- Hey.
- Hey.

101
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:13,164
I honestly feel like I’ve been run over
by six or eight trucks, but I’m fine.

102
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:15,167
And by fine you mean…

103
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,378
What does it look like?

104
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:22,465
We have to talk about the Monster.
His sister, I saw her plan.

105
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:25,385
Her goal. It’s way worse than
slaughtering the entire Library.

106
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:27,679
They want to take it up with their parents.
The Old Gods.

107
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,639
Wait, what does that even mean?

108
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,767
I don't know, and neither did she, she
just knows it would feel good to kill them,

109
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,770
and eradicate us in some sort of
insane nuclear winter,

110
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,355
which she could give
negative three shits about.

111
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,399
Do they know how to get to the Old Gods?

112
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:41,860
They found a spell at the library.

113
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:43,611
It opens a door to their plane.

114
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:46,906
My guess is The Monster wants to
find his sister, finish the plan,

115
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:50,702
kill the Old Gods or get
smashed to a pulp trying

116
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,788
That means smash Eliot.

117
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:57,083
The upside to them
inhabiting our bodies is,

118
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,711
she left this in my pocket.

119
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,382
Whatever's in this is sure
to unlock the door.

120
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:05,717
Holy shit. Well done.

121
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,387
Well shit, I was ready to give up.

122
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:11,890
Welcome back.

123
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:16,060
- Towel?
- Uh, yeah. Thank you.

124
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,062
So was it weird? Being a fish?

125
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:22,526
It felt, uh, very natural.

126
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,279
The weird part was

127
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:37,499
how you were so incredibly selfless

128
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,877
and, no offense, sweet which is…

129
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,130
Not on brand? I know.

130
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,593
Anyone who really knows me
knows that I'll do anything if I love you.

131
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:53,265
Listen, Hoberman, don't be stupid.

132
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:57,227
I'm not actually fun or easy
when I'm in love.

133
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,440
Fun and easy are overrated.

134
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:12,867
- Oh, Christ, not…
- Oh. Ooh my day.

135
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:15,411
Oh, hi. Sorry, I just un-fished.

136
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,997
So, anyone else super hungry?

137
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:21,418
I'm craving fish sticks? Is that weird?

138
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:22,920
You know what, I'm just gonna go with it.

139
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:28,842
Where's Eliot?

140
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:30,260
Did you do it?

141
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,887
We got one so far.

142
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,473
You didn't save Eliot, did you?

143
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:39,227
Of course you didn't,
you cocked it up trying to save Julia.

144
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:43,148
- That bitch has a bulletproof body.
- Not anymore.

145
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:45,442
We don’t even know
if Eliot’s still alive in there.

146
00:08:45,526 --> 00:08:46,818
You don't even know
what the hell was going on.

147
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:50,488
- You had one fucking job you…
- Yeah, fuck off, Margo!

148
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:56,077
Oh, Jesus Herbert Walker Christ,
you're predictable, you know that?

149
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:57,620
What the shit?

150
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,289
Oh my God.

151
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:02,876
It just came out of me. So strong.

152
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:09,132
Guys. I think I have
some special Fish Magicks.

153
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,553
Act out. Right?

154
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:16,055
Or you touched the Reservoir.
And you got dosed up.

155
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,058
Yeah, that makes
a thousand times more sense.

156
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,937
But still pretty act out worthy, no?

157
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:29,987
- Hello, Kady.
- How are you, Zelda?

158
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:32,155
I understand your anger.

159
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:35,283
No, see, that'd require
actual human feelings.

160
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:36,326
Kady.

161
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:40,830
You piece of shit,
pearl-clutching, sociopath…

162
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,499
None of this was calculated on my part.

163
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,293
Everett,

164
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:49,839
I have believed in his goodness
for over a century.

165
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,301
Everett is in it for Everett.

166
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:59,683
If you are right,
then all the death, all of it,

167
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:03,353
it's on my hands.

168
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:08,901
Look,

169
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:13,530
I know you're not evil.

170
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:17,451
Just the definition of "obedience."

171
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,413
I used to be.

172
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,460
Prove it.

173
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:30,422
Man, I’m good.

174
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,219
Yeah. Great, thanks.

175
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:52,486
So. You, uh…

176
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:56,740
- You feel okay?
- Yeah, thanks.

177
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:00,577
And by thanks, I mean,
thank you for deciding that I should age,

178
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,745
grow old,
and probably die from a paper cut.

179
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:06,040
Oh yeah, and that I’ll
never get to do magic again,

180
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,375
because I’m perfect now.

181
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,169
Did Professor Lipson tell you?

182
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:11,796
I am perfectly normal.

183
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,968
And magic doesn’t come from normal.
So thank you for deciding that without me.

184
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,138
I um,

185
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:22,808
have to do that thing.

186
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,730
- Look. It was a shit decision.
- It was my decision.

187
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:30,607
- I know.
- Do you?

188
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:35,028
Because I don’t. I will never know.

189
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:37,906
I just know that this is not
how it was supposed to be.

190
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:40,867
Okay, truth, I was selfish,

191
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:44,162
you were in pain and it was
never gonna stop and I couldn’t.

192
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:46,373
And you know what?

193
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:50,627
I would do it again
to not lose you again.

194
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:00,012
Wait.

195
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:03,098
Penny...

196
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:11,607
Just stay here
and let me be pissed at you.

197
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:14,610
I can do that.

198
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:27,247
So Everett wants to be a god.

199
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:29,082
And now he's so juiced,

200
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,167
that he can just rip
the god-power right out of Eliot.

201
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,795
So why don’t we just let him?

202
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:35,630
So, let that psycho book-fondler

203
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:38,300
rip the Monster out of
Eliot and probably kill him?

204
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:44,931
- Hey, come on, where are you going?
- She's pissed at me

205
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:47,267
but more pissed at herself
for being so pissed.

206
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:49,602
She's not great at apologizing
so she’s going to walk around

207
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,729
until she calms down, and hope I forget.

208
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:54,607
She’s right. Anything where he could die
is off the table.

209
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:57,402
- Hello.
- Shit! I mean, hi.

210
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,738
Where is my sister?

211
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:02,073
Where is the scroll?

212
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:05,243
Uh, the scroll?

213
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:08,038
- Answer me now.
- Um, what does it look like again?

214
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,334
No.

215
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:20,884
I don't like you. Do I?

216
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,344
I have no idea.

217
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:26,639
But I can assure you,

218
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,100
you will hate me.

219
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:50,914
Hello.

220
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:56,086
You did it. What an achievement, huh?
Two humans.

221
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,255
Test seven-sixty-four is
usually what trips your kind up.

222
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,008
But, hey,
as we say in linear based binary,

223
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:04,886
infinite time is just
a parabolic lost sock.

224
00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:06,722
Right?

225
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:17,149
You do speak Linear Base Binary,
don't you?

226
00:14:18,233 --> 00:14:21,236
No? Then how did you complete
Task seven-sixty-four?

227
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,405
Or the rest of the 1,293?

228
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,406
- Okay, so we're not on a Quest.-
We were.

229
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,908
- Yeah, last year.
- Crushed it.

230
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,868
Totally, except the part
that we're trying to fix now.

231
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:32,580
Wait, wait. Hold on. How do you have
The Resonant Singularity Scroll?

232
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:34,583
Kind of by accident.

233
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,669
My fish magicks went off. And…

234
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:39,337
Don’t…don’t…

235
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:42,382
I was not trained for this eventuality.

236
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:44,259
We just want to talk to an Old God.

237
00:14:46,345 --> 00:14:47,888
Do you now.

238
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:52,351
Let me explain this in a way
that you might understand.

239
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:54,686
A chihuahua

240
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:58,648
just demanded a blowjob
from an archangel.

241
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:03,487
Hm? Also, I'm not explaining
fish magicks to my bosses.

242
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:06,197
It’s a real…

243
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:09,325
Also, tee time.

244
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,744
No, come on. Look, hang on.
Hang on, look.

245
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,246
We need the Old Gods,
but they need us too.

246
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,707
Need you? Hubris much?

247
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,752
Five minutes? Please.

248
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:21,004
So the Old Gods wouldn't maybe
be a little bit motivated

249
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:23,256
to help once we tell them about the…

250
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,008
Not really.

251
00:15:25,092 --> 00:15:28,928
Those monsters,
sorry nobody told you, but,

252
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:30,013
they can't be killed.

253
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:31,973
Then why create them at all?

254
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:34,393
Why are nickels bigger than dimes?

255
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:37,395
Why are nickels bigger than dimes?

256
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,231
Wait, so there's no way to stop them?

257
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:45,695
You said "kill."

258
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:46,738
They can be stopped.

259
00:15:46,822 --> 00:15:49,616
And can you think of any good reason

260
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,411
why your bosses wouldn't want
us to do that?

261
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:57,040
I mean, if they don’t have
to actually do anything,

262
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,668
can't hurt.

263
00:16:02,504 --> 00:16:05,215
Okay, boys. Here's my advice.

264
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:09,178
Drop 'em in the Seam.

265
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:11,221
The Seam?

266
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:14,224
This is ridiculous, you're imbeciles.

267
00:16:14,308 --> 00:16:16,976
Not arguing that, but

268
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,022
the seam between what, exactly?

269
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:25,276
This universe and,
y'know, the anti-verse.

270
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,529
Where everything's all dead.

271
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:32,534
So we go to the dead-verse.

272
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:35,495
Duck-on-a-muffin, no!

273
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,498
You go up to the Seam,
you drop the suckers in.

274
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:42,627
And that would be, where?

275
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:44,087
Use your heads, guys.

276
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:46,256
The Seam's not quite sealed,

277
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,216
what could that mean oh,

278
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,344
maybe it leaked,
and created a weird little pocket world

279
00:16:51,428 --> 00:16:53,889
where everything's all
backwards and lifeless.

280
00:16:54,473 --> 00:16:57,684
- Wait, The Mirror World!?
- Sure. Not a bad name.

281
00:16:57,768 --> 00:17:00,979
So you go there, you find the Seam.

282
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:04,983
And whatever you toss in will
never, ever come back out again.

283
00:17:05,067 --> 00:17:07,110
I am insanely late.

284
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:10,780
Here you go.

285
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:14,826
To the victors, cake!

286
00:17:19,998 --> 00:17:23,209
Okay, but the Mirror
Room is an entire world,

287
00:17:23,293 --> 00:17:24,753
how are we gonna find the Seam?

288
00:17:24,837 --> 00:17:28,548
Goddamn it, I don’t think I could
ever eat non-Old-God cake again.

289
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:31,343
Perfection is a curse.

290
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:36,598
Oh, right, find the Seam?

291
00:17:36,682 --> 00:17:38,516
- Guy didn't say.
- We don't have to go looking for it.

292
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,894
I think I know where it is.

293
00:17:43,522 --> 00:17:46,733
There’s this place, this door,

294
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:50,445
and what’s behind it felt different.

295
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:51,654
Different like?

296
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:54,283
Like I knew I shouldn’t go near it.
Even when I was a Niffin.

297
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:57,327
Well, perfect, we should definitely
all walk right in there.

298
00:17:57,411 --> 00:18:00,538
So, according to Fogg,
the Monster is out there right now.

299
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:02,499
Confused, for as long
as that spell will last.

300
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:06,002
Twenty-Three,
if you can Travel us out there,

301
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:07,754
we have an opportunity to surprise him.

302
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:09,923
This is where we open
the room for pitches,

303
00:18:10,007 --> 00:18:13,051
because I accidentally
lost all my fish magicks,

304
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:15,386
and now none of us has the juice
to do the Bond.

305
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,599
What about Dean Fogg? He’s gotta have
an extra battery, right?

306
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:20,683
Nothing powerful enough. We asked.

307
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,644
There has to be something else.

308
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:25,939
There is.

309
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:28,399
Hedge Witches.

310
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:29,776
Can barely tie their shoes.

311
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,654
Fuck you, and also you're wrong.

312
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:35,949
A huge untapped pool.

313
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:40,120
Look, they're used to crumbs and
yes, ambient is low.

314
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:43,289
- But you know what amplifies it?
- Cooperative magic.

315
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:45,041
We tell everyone,

316
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:49,462
and I mean all over the world,
wherever there's a pipe.

317
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:51,297
Fillory even.

318
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:54,384
And we all do the same
thing at the same time

319
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:57,929
You can't get that many people
to cooperate,

320
00:18:58,013 --> 00:18:59,264
this isn't Sesame Street.

321
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:01,683
There are some shitty Hedges.

322
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:04,477
But there are enough good ones
that we could pull this off.

323
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:08,148
And we need them. Kady's right.
This is a good idea.

324
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:10,817
We need a way to get the message out, fast.
To time it right.

325
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:15,071
- I've got someone who can help.
- They’d have to keep casting the entire time.

326
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:17,783
So we can keep the Monsters in the bottles
until we get them through the Seam.

327
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:21,745
This is right on the hairy edge
of what I'd even call a plan.

328
00:19:24,665 --> 00:19:27,584
- Hey, Q, Can we talk a sec?
- Yeah.

329
00:19:27,668 --> 00:19:30,545
- I've been thinking.
- Me too. I think that

330
00:19:30,629 --> 00:19:33,256
you should tell me where
the Seam is so that I can do it.

331
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,591
Why you?

332
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:39,012
Because I’m better equipped to…

333
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:44,267
Because I want you to be safe.

334
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:46,436
I want you to be safe.

335
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:57,280
Are you saying that you…

336
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,407
No, I’m saying that we’ve…

337
00:19:59,491 --> 00:20:04,663
we’ve tried the whole saving each
other thing with mixed results.

338
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:09,084
Yeah, sure, but I…

339
00:20:09,168 --> 00:20:11,628
I… And I've been thinking
about what works best,

340
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:15,840
and I think…no, I know
we’re best when we’re a team.

341
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:18,677
Okay, when me and you, together.

342
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:23,891
If nothing else, I like the sound of it.

343
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:27,060
Because it's true.

344
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:30,480
So, it’s decided?

345
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:33,566
Okay, people, let's do this.

346
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:37,905
If you need to touch butts, make it
quick, we got a multiverse to save.

347
00:20:38,697 --> 00:20:40,574
How does she know our thing?

348
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:56,798
Stop torturing yourself.

349
00:20:58,175 --> 00:20:59,593
- I want to help.
- Julia,

350
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:02,471
it’s going to be okay.

351
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:05,349
Or it won’t.

352
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:08,727
You're just zen because you think
this is it,

353
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:12,439
what Other Penny told you,
some big thing you have to do.

354
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:14,816
No.

355
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,528
I'm zen ‘cause there's
a lot scarier shit than dying.

356
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:22,157
And right now I'm looking at you.
So I'm good.

357
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:28,038
Bye, Julia.

358
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,874
Bye.

359
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:49,642
There's something
I want you to know, Sister.

360
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:55,649
This world, it's not just the bad things
or the ones who wronged us.

361
00:21:57,734 --> 00:22:00,320
There’s…

362
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:05,617
There’s such beauty. In everything.

363
00:22:05,701 --> 00:22:07,744
Even the quiet.

364
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,831
Especially the quiet.

365
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,764
Hey!

366
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:31,268
Hey, motherfucker.

367
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:41,903
Eliot.

368
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:43,780
Eliot.

369
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:45,282
Eliot, stay with me.

370
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:53,916
Now!

371
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,668
Eliot!

372
00:23:47,886 --> 00:23:48,887
Eliot?

373
00:23:48,971 --> 00:23:51,806
If there's a tunnel with grandma tell
her to piss off and come back to me.

374
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,350
You selfish fuck! Get back here!

375
00:23:54,935 --> 00:23:55,853
Eliot?

376
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:59,231
Eliot, please.

377
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:01,817
Eliot!

378
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:06,196
Well, when you put it so sweetly, Bambi.

379
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,991
Do something.
Please.

380
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:11,701
They need all the ambient for those bottles.

381
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:13,703
What is the point of being a Magician
if you can't do this?

382
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:15,455
Before I was a Magician,
I was a trauma surgeon,

383
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:17,582
I'm perfectly capable of saving
him the old-fashioned way.

384
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:19,668
If you need to cry go outside.

385
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:30,888
- They holding?
- Yeah. For now. We have to hurry.

386
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,655
Okay.

387
00:24:48,739 --> 00:24:50,573
Home is right through here,

388
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:53,451
we do this, we move quick.

389
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:55,286
Okay, remember, no Travelling,

390
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:56,913
and no magic.

391
00:24:56,997 --> 00:24:58,916
It goes bad fast here.

392
00:25:19,186 --> 00:25:21,104
- Alice?
- Just give me a sec.

393
00:25:21,188 --> 00:25:23,524
We’ll listen to your gut next time.

394
00:25:35,786 --> 00:25:37,912
It’s the lab?

395
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:39,247
Why?

396
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:40,791
Who cares?

397
00:25:47,256 --> 00:25:48,924
Careful.

398
00:25:57,516 --> 00:25:59,267
That's it.

399
00:25:59,351 --> 00:26:00,602
That’s The Seam.

400
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:11,238
Okay, let’s do this.

401
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:24,668
Okay. Let me.

402
00:26:26,837 --> 00:26:27,838
Everett.

403
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:34,636
Quentin?

404
00:26:35,846 --> 00:26:37,472
That's mine.

405
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:39,224
Hand it over, please?

406
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:42,436
- You know you can’t cast in here.
- I know.

407
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:47,191
Mutually assured destruction.

408
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:51,278
Which is why you'll give it to me.

409
00:26:59,786 --> 00:27:01,287
You tried.

410
00:27:01,371 --> 00:27:03,248
You did. I'm impressed.

411
00:27:04,082 --> 00:27:05,375
But that bond won't hold.

412
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:09,003
Give it to me before the Monster gets out
and everything goes far more shit-shaped.

413
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:10,839
Quentin, I think you need to…

414
00:27:10,923 --> 00:27:14,051
Your friend Eliot is safe.
I'll let you go.

415
00:27:15,177 --> 00:27:16,637
Just let me handle this.

416
00:27:17,221 --> 00:27:20,974
- You'll become a god.
- You've met gods, but I won't be like them.

417
00:27:21,725 --> 00:27:25,020
I studied them so I could do better,
be better.

418
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:27,481
Trust me.

419
00:27:29,107 --> 00:27:30,442
Okay.

420
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:36,240
Okay. I get it.
Okay.

421
00:27:39,368 --> 00:27:42,203
You always were smarter than
the books gave you credit for.

422
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:44,622
It'll be okay, Q.

423
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:48,001
In fact you'll go down as a hero,
I'll make sure of it.

424
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:50,754
Take her. Do it. Now.

425
00:27:50,838 --> 00:27:53,340
What? No!

426
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:56,009
- What did you do?
- Just a Minor Mending.

427
00:27:56,093 --> 00:55:53,830
Quentin!

428
00:27:56,093 --> 00:27:58,262
Give it to me.

429
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:30,080
Hey.

430
00:30:31,081 --> 00:30:32,875
Been a while.

431
00:30:35,002 --> 00:30:37,004
Welcome to the Underworld.

432
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:39,882
Oh, shit.

433
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:43,177
Really?

434
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:49,308
What’s this?

435
00:30:49,808 --> 00:30:51,143
Hot chocolate.

436
00:30:54,897 --> 00:30:57,566
I'm dead but there's still hot chocolate.

437
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:00,861
That's a good sign.

438
00:31:04,865 --> 00:31:06,533
What did I do?

439
00:31:08,535 --> 00:31:10,037
What do you think you did?

440
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:13,874
I don't know, it happened so fast.

441
00:31:20,172 --> 00:31:23,467
This is the part
where I can't lie, right?

442
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,723
My whole life is…

443
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,391
Revealed.

444
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,731
But it only means anything
if you reveal it to yourself.

445
00:31:39,775 --> 00:31:41,944
Okay.

446
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:51,620
Most of my life I’ve been, um,
in and out of hospitals, and,

447
00:31:54,498 --> 00:31:56,583
you know,

448
00:31:56,667 --> 00:31:59,253
suicidal thoughts, and notes,

449
00:32:00,921 --> 00:32:02,381
a lot of notes.

450
00:32:03,674 --> 00:32:05,551
Attempts and...

451
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:12,224
Meds and therapy. And then

452
00:32:14,101 --> 00:32:16,562
I found Brakebills,

453
00:32:18,605 --> 00:32:20,774
and all that went away.

454
00:32:23,151 --> 00:32:26,572
Or…I thought, but…

455
00:32:27,865 --> 00:32:28,866
But?

456
00:32:31,952 --> 00:32:36,206
Did I do something brave
to save my friends,

457
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:40,460
or did I finally find a way
to kill myself?

458
00:32:44,173 --> 00:32:45,757
Okay.

459
00:32:45,841 --> 00:32:48,218
I can see we’re gonna
need the deluxe package.

460
00:32:48,302 --> 00:32:50,721
Which…it’s okay. No surprise.

461
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:53,891
Let’s go.

462
00:33:03,692 --> 00:33:05,694
I don't know what to say.

463
00:33:25,589 --> 00:33:28,467
I mean, what words are ever going to…

464
00:33:29,384 --> 00:33:30,719
They won't.

465
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:51,276
Appreciate the level
of sincere grief, dude,

466
00:35:52,945 --> 00:35:57,074
I seem to remember when I kicked it?
You laughing.

467
00:36:02,246 --> 00:36:03,621
I’m really sorry about that.

468
00:36:03,705 --> 00:36:07,793
It’s okay. I’ve met you.

469
00:36:10,879 --> 00:36:12,464
I think you know your answer now.

470
00:36:13,465 --> 00:36:16,093
The story, for them, it's just starting.

471
00:36:17,344 --> 00:36:21,306
But it won't be the same story,
because of you.

472
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:24,350
You didn't just save their lives,

473
00:36:24,434 --> 00:36:26,978
you changed their lives

474
00:36:27,062 --> 00:36:29,606
as much as they changed yours.

475
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:32,109
You didn't want to leave all that.
Did you?

476
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:53,422
- It’s time to say goodbye.
- All right. Just one last look.

477
00:37:56,401 --> 00:37:57,945
Are they gonna be okay?

478
00:37:59,363 --> 00:38:02,282
Oh yeah, once they reach here, just fine.

479
00:38:03,408 --> 00:38:04,993
No, up there.

480
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:09,122
Oh, up there.

481
00:38:11,625 --> 00:38:15,754
You'll notice control is done
with the ring finger positioning

482
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:17,172
if you watch...

483
00:38:34,398 --> 00:38:37,650
And the blood. Feels like we're
never gonna get it all out.

484
00:38:37,734 --> 00:38:42,322
Then we tear down and rebuild.
Which is probably long overdue.

485
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,033
I got here as fast as I could.

486
00:38:45,951 --> 00:38:47,452
Thank you.

487
00:38:47,536 --> 00:38:50,455
With so few Librarians, each is precious.

488
00:38:50,539 --> 00:38:53,458
We're lucky you're still here.
To run this place.

489
00:38:55,252 --> 00:38:57,212
Oh no.

490
00:38:57,296 --> 00:38:58,171
No, I can't do that.

491
00:38:58,255 --> 00:39:01,007
Your humility is charming
but this isn't the time.

492
00:39:01,091 --> 00:39:03,510
I know what I'm capable of,

493
00:39:04,219 --> 00:39:05,679
what I feel.

494
00:39:06,471 --> 00:39:07,764
It should not be me.

495
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:11,602
I know exactly who we need.
But I'm not sure they...

496
00:39:12,352 --> 00:39:14,020
We need you to go find someone.

497
00:39:14,104 --> 00:39:17,316
And do your very best to convince
them to come and help us.

498
00:39:17,858 --> 00:39:19,193
Alice Quinn.

499
00:39:23,113 --> 00:39:24,448
Eliot and Margo.

500
00:39:25,657 --> 00:39:26,950
Yeah.

501
00:39:28,035 --> 00:39:29,369
That one’s kind of funny.

502
00:39:29,953 --> 00:39:32,789
Funny ha-ha or funny... uh-oh?

503
00:39:33,373 --> 00:39:35,041
God, this feels so good.

504
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:36,584
It sure does.

505
00:39:36,668 --> 00:39:38,586
Okay, let's see what-the-what

506
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,588
with getting un-banished my throne back

507
00:39:40,672 --> 00:39:43,842
and my man for some
white-hot grief banging.

508
00:39:45,177 --> 00:39:47,512
I’m sorry,

509
00:39:47,596 --> 00:39:49,305
that came out way harsher than I thought.

510
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:50,265
It's okay.

511
00:39:50,349 --> 00:39:53,601
It's gonna be weird
for a little while, so,

512
00:39:53,685 --> 00:39:55,771
we’re just going to have to…

513
00:39:58,065 --> 00:39:59,775
Margo?

514
00:40:05,697 --> 00:40:09,284
The fuck did they do to my castle?

515
00:40:13,163 --> 00:40:14,914
Uh, pardon me, sir?

516
00:40:14,998 --> 00:40:17,626
Crazy question but,

517
00:40:18,335 --> 00:40:21,004
Fillory is still ruled by
Acting High King Fen, right?

518
00:40:21,088 --> 00:40:23,715
If this is some kind of loyalty test…

519
00:40:23,799 --> 00:40:27,302
No, no, uh, we've just
been away for a while.

520
00:40:28,387 --> 00:40:30,847
The Dark King reigns.
Glory to his rule.

521
00:40:30,931 --> 00:40:34,267
High King Fen and Josh The Fresh Prince
were overthrown three hundred years ago.

522
00:40:34,351 --> 00:40:36,645
The gods curse them both.

523
00:40:37,312 --> 00:40:38,647
Have a good day.

524
00:40:45,821 --> 00:40:48,698
The one that I'm the most worried about
is Julia.

525
00:40:48,782 --> 00:40:50,450
I know.

526
00:40:51,535 --> 00:40:53,453
She’s fought so hard for magic.

527
00:40:53,537 --> 00:40:55,288
She's been in a weird place.

528
00:40:55,372 --> 00:40:58,834
Then comes to the end
of this crazy journey

529
00:41:01,211 --> 00:41:02,629
and feels at peace.

530
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,965
And magic?

531
00:41:06,091 --> 00:41:08,093
Comes from pain.

532
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,575
Goodbye, Q.

533
00:41:39,583 --> 00:41:41,835
Q, are you doing this?

534
00:41:49,885 --> 00:41:51,178
Holy shit.

535
00:41:58,143 --> 00:41:59,561
I’m doing this.

536
00:42:13,575 --> 00:42:15,034
Did you?

537
00:42:15,118 --> 00:42:17,454
Did you just see that? I have…

538
00:42:18,747 --> 00:42:20,582
Yeah.

539
00:42:20,666 --> 00:42:23,377
So, what are you going to do with it?

540
00:42:28,799 --> 00:42:31,050
What happens next?

541
00:42:31,134 --> 00:42:33,554
Learn to love the mysteries, man.

542
00:42:34,388 --> 00:42:36,347
Can I ask you something?

543
00:42:36,431 --> 00:42:37,766
Yes. I'm nicer.

544
00:42:39,643 --> 00:42:44,314
All that stuff we think protects us
or motivates us or scares us up there?

545
00:42:44,398 --> 00:42:48,110
Here, it just all falls away.

546
00:42:49,152 --> 00:42:51,822
You're finally just you.

547
00:42:53,782 --> 00:42:55,158
You'll see.

548
00:43:07,629 --> 00:43:10,549
This is as far as I go, brother.

549
00:43:56,637 --> 00:43:58,972
