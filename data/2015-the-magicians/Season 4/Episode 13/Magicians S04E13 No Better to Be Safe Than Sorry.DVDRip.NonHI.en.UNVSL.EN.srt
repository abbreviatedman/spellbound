1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,512
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,536 --> 00:00:04,698
When the moment comes, do it.

3
00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:07,172
Mayakovsky told you
what your discipline is?

4
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:10,973
<i>Repair of small objects.</i>

5
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:13,445
<i>You did always excel
at minor mending.</i>

6
00:00:13,614 --> 00:00:16,345
I want you in my
life. I want that too.

7
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,681
<i>The Binder knew Julia
had many questions.</i>

8
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:19,845
And he knew the answer.

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,786
So you can help me
become a goddess again?

10
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,484
You're hoarding magic,
trying to become a god?

11
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:27,653
By becoming one of them, I can
rip their secrets away from them.

12
00:00:27,794 --> 00:00:30,320
<i>I redirected the power
I need into a reservoir.</i>

13
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:32,696
<i>You're saying Josh
is a fucking fish?</i>

14
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,044
This should fix the whole
fish deal. I'll bring Eliot back.

15
00:00:35,068 --> 00:00:37,333
<i>My sister... I need
to find her a body.</i>

16
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:38,548
<i>So The Monster took Julia.</i>

17
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:39,649
<i>We need to find them.</i>

18
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:42,352
We have the axes and the demon
bottles. You have the incorporate bond.

19
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:45,005
Casting an incorporate bond
strong enough to hold a god

20
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:46,978
<i>would take an insane
amount of power.</i>

21
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,243
The question is,
who put us here?

22
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:50,440
Our parents.

23
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,544
They're more vulnerable than you
think. If we can get to their realm.

24
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,316
<i>We had a key. A scroll.</i>

25
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:58,257
Julia, if you're in
there, I'm sorry.

26
00:00:59,593 --> 00:01:01,721
Hey, Monster

27
00:01:02,496 --> 00:01:03,759
Lady.

28
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,073
Adorable. So determined.

29
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,872
Maybe I'll keep you as pets.

30
00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:30,754
Then again, I like my pets
strong, and you're weak.

31
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:32,486
You're already
fading, aren't you?

32
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,637
It worked. Q, the bond.

33
00:01:53,747 --> 00:01:55,427
I don't know how long
that's going to hold.

34
00:01:55,482 --> 00:01:56,559
We need to get to Brakebills.

35
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:57,727
I have something that can help.

36
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:59,720
We need to get her
help. Wait, where's Eliot?

37
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,898
We can't. We don't have enough.
We have to go back to the reservoir.

38
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:03,151
After we get her to a doctor.

39
00:02:03,256 --> 00:02:05,157
No, he's right. We have
to go to the reservoir.

40
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:06,725
She's right.

41
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:13,130
Always gotta be a fucking twist.

42
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:30,443
In my office, under
my desk, trap door,

43
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:33,112
Popper 22 to unlock.
Don't put your hand in there.

44
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:34,821
Temperature's at absolute zero.

45
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:37,153
Should slow her down a bit. Go!

46
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:39,919
You're okay.

47
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:42,289
You wanna hurry that up?

48
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,308
Give her something
for the pain at least!

49
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,960
I just did. Twice.

50
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:51,029
Damn it. Here, my
last one. Use it on her.

51
00:02:51,138 --> 00:02:52,348
You'll be okay. Stay with me.

52
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:53,396
Thank you, Henry.

53
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,202
Restraints, please!

54
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:56,640
You're okay.

55
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:58,703
What's happening to her?

56
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:00,474
So her body,
which is very weird,

57
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:01,858
it keeps trying to
close the wound

58
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:03,043
which is heavily enchanted

59
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,394
because the weapon
was also very weird,

60
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:06,284
and it just tears itself
right back open again.

61
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,430
Well, make it stop!

62
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:08,854
I hadn't thought
of that, thank you.

63
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,617
I will use this to keep
her comfortable and...

64
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,524
How long is she
gonna be like this?

65
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:16,119
We are not in what I would
call charted territory right now.

66
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:22,901
I think I might know someone.

67
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,567
<i>It was a difficult
choice for Penny 23</i>

68
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,300
to even call upon The Binder.

69
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:30,707
The Binder was certain, however,
that Penny 23 had made the right choice.

70
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:33,438
Julia, The Binder explained,

71
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:37,279
would remain in a cycle of
wounding, agony, for millennia.

72
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:40,211
Her body required
transformation.

73
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:43,916
Luckily...

74
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:48,189
this was The Binder's expertise.

75
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,340
Well, great. Let's
get on with it.

76
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:52,924
The Binder needed direction.

77
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:56,768
Initiate her long and arduous
journey to full goddesshood

78
00:03:57,604 --> 00:04:00,096
or revert her body to
that of a mere human?

79
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,152
If it was up to me,
that'd be a no-brainer.

80
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:04,303
Yeah, but it's not.

81
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:09,047
It should be her choice.

82
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:15,450
The Binder paused for
Julia to make that choice.

83
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:21,889
Then dryly noted, she
wasn't in a talking mood.

84
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:24,954
The Binder assumed he was

85
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:26,897
speaking with her
husband or master?

86
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:28,060
No. No!

87
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,738
And yet the decision
had to be made,

88
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:31,965
surely not,

89
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:35,372
The Binder reasoned,
by this spinster nursemaid.

90
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,605
Uh, I run this hospital, Book.

91
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,771
Still, and The Binder replied,

92
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:43,476
stating the obvious
to the strident female,

93
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:45,850
someone needed
to choose for Julia.

94
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,419
<i>Reed's Mark.</i>

95
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,459
<i>Best of bad options.
Damage was done.</i>

96
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:57,391
I'd rather not die, so
it's fine on that level,

97
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,493
but also...

98
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:03,602
Look, I've no interest
in being Batman,

99
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,300
but there comes a point when
even selfish bros need to mobilize.

100
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:10,307
Six hedges, in
the last 48 hours,

101
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,845
were pulled into vans
by men wearing gray.

102
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:16,080
Woke up at home with
Reed's Marks. Jesus.

103
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,576
The Library just
stopped pretending.

104
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:20,282
They're rounding us up.

105
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:22,378
We need you.

106
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,961
You know what I
wanted to do with my life?

107
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:30,688
To be?

108
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,761
Penny's goddamn girlfriend.

109
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:41,036
I acted tough, but
all I wanted was him.

110
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:43,337
You're human.

111
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,570
I'm weak.

112
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:50,176
Kady, die when
less people need you.

113
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,551
Hey. Hey.

114
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:04,022
Honestly, I feel like
I've been run over

115
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:07,192
by six or eight
trucks, but I'm fine.

116
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,166
And by fine, you mean...

117
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:11,535
What does it look like?

118
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:14,505
We need to talk
about The Monster.

119
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:16,509
His sister. I saw
her plan, her goal.

120
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:19,271
And it's way worse than
slaughtering the entire Library.

121
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,678
They want to take it up with
their parents, the Old Gods.

122
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:23,682
Wait, what does that even mean?

123
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,110
I don't know, and
neither does she.

124
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:26,863
She just knows it would
feel good to kill them

125
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,914
and eradicate us in some
sort of insane nuclear winter

126
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,467
which she could give
negative three shits about.

127
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,392
Do they know how to
get to the Old Gods?

128
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,022
They found a spell,
uh, in the Library.

129
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:37,655
It opens a door to their plane.

130
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,090
My guess is The Monster
wants to find his sister,

131
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,396
finish the plan,
kill the Old Gods

132
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:44,471
or get smashed to a pulp trying.

133
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:46,767
That means smash Eliot.

134
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:51,144
Well, the upside to them
inhabiting our bodies

135
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,509
is she left this in my pocket.

136
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,743
Whatever's in this is
sure to unlock the door.

137
00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:59,753
Holy shit, well done.

138
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,382
Well, shit, I was
ready to give up.

139
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:05,919
Welcome back.

140
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,220
Oh, oh!

141
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:10,090
Towel? Uh, yeah. Thank you.

142
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,926
So was it weird being a fish?

143
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:16,201
It felt, uh, very natural.

144
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,300
The weird part was

145
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:30,748
how you were so
incredibly selfless

146
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,481
and, no offense, sweet.

147
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:37,056
Which is... Not
on brand? I know.

148
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:39,588
Anyone who really knows me

149
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,628
knows that I'll do
anything if I love you.

150
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,294
Listen, Hoberman,
don't be stupid.

151
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm not actually fun or
easy when I'm in love.

152
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,370
Fun and easy are overrated.

153
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,385
Oh, Christ. Not
my day. Oh! Uh...

154
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,354
Oh, hi! Sorry, I just un-fished.

155
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:11,948
So, anyone else super hungry?

156
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,694
I'm craving fish sticks.

157
00:08:14,794 --> 00:08:16,994
Is that weird? You know
what? I'm just gonna go with it.

158
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:22,597
Where's Eliot?

159
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:24,330
Did you do it?

160
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,662
We got one so far.

161
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,501
You didn't save Eliot, did you?

162
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:30,303
Of course you didn't.

163
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,010
You cocked it up
trying to save Julia.

164
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:37,216
That bitch has a bulletproof
body. Not anymore.

165
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:39,343
We don't even know
if Eliot's still alive.

166
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:40,496
Yeah, it was a shit-show.

167
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,597
You don't even know
what the hell was going on.

168
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:43,453
You had one fucking job...

169
00:08:43,556 --> 00:08:44,556
Yeah, fuck off, Margo.

170
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:47,217
Oh, Jesus Herbert Walker Christ.

171
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:48,647
You're predictable,
you know that?

172
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,057
Whoa.

173
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:53,190
What the shit? Oh, my God!

174
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,901
It just came out
of me so strong.

175
00:08:57,003 --> 00:09:02,840
Guys, I think I have
some special fish magicks.

176
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:05,375
Oh!

177
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:07,310
Act out, right?

178
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:10,014
Or you touched the reservoir
and you got dosed up.

179
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:13,053
Yeah, that makes a
thousand times more sense.

180
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:15,883
But still pretty act
out worthy, no?

181
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:23,024
Hello, Kady. How are you, Zelda?

182
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,093
I understand you're angry.

183
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:28,259
No, see, that'd require
actual human feelings.

184
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:29,368
Kady...

185
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:33,771
You piece-of-shit,
pearl-clutching sociopathic...

186
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,568
None of this was
calculated on my part.

187
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:38,308
Everett...

188
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:42,948
I have believed in his
goodness for over a century.

189
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:45,041
Everett is in it for Everett.

190
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:50,814
If you are right,
then all the death,

191
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:53,056
all of it,

192
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,328
it's on my hands.

193
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,062
Look,

194
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:05,262
I know you're not evil.

195
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:10,342
Just the definition
of obedience.

196
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:14,474
I used to be.

197
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:19,485
Prove it.

198
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:23,453
Hmm. Man, I'm good.

199
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:27,959
Yeah. Great, thanks.

200
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:47,405
So you... So you feel okay?

201
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,639
Yeah, thanks.

202
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:53,314
And by thanks I mean thank
you for deciding that I should age,

203
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,615
grow old, and probably
die from a paper cut.

204
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,686
Oh, yeah, and that I'll
never get to do magic again

205
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,191
because I'm perfect now.

206
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:01,793
Did Professor Lipson tell you?

207
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:04,191
I am perfectly normal.

208
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,800
And we all know magic
doesn't come from normal,

209
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:08,926
so thank you for
deciding that without me.

210
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:13,099
I, um...

211
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,635
Have to do that thing.

212
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,310
Look, it was a shit decision.

213
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,414
It was my decision. I know.

214
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,984
Do you? 'Cause I don't.

215
00:11:25,752 --> 00:11:27,152
I will never know.

216
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:30,718
I just know that this is not
how it was supposed to be.

217
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:33,159
Okay, truth, I was selfish.

218
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,860
You were in pain

219
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:37,124
and it was never going
to stop, and I couldn't.

220
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,364
And you know what?

221
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:43,366
I would do it again
to not lose you again.

222
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:53,006
Wait.

223
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:56,079
Penny.

224
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:03,914
You just stay here and
let me be pissed at you.

225
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:07,659
I can do that.

226
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:20,200
So Everett wants to be a god.

227
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:22,105
And now he's so juiced that

228
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,200
he can just rip the god
power right out of Eliot.

229
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:26,906
So why don't we just let him?

230
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:30,006
So let that psycho book-fondler
rip The Monster out of Eliot

231
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,381
and probably kill him?

232
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:36,079
Hey, come on.
Where are you going?

233
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:38,021
She's pissed at me,

234
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,219
but more pissed at
herself for being so pissed.

235
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:41,659
She's not great at apologizing,

236
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,805
so she's going to walk around

237
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:44,306
until she calms down
and hope I forget.

238
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,425
She's right. Anything where
he could die is off the table.

239
00:12:47,734 --> 00:12:51,034
Hello. Shit! I mean, hi.

240
00:12:51,137 --> 00:12:52,628
Where is my sister?

241
00:12:53,906 --> 00:12:55,135
And where is the scroll?

242
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:58,268
"The scroll"?

243
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,776
Answer me now.

244
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:01,190
Um, what does
it look like again?

245
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:02,238
Ahh!

246
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:05,849
No.

247
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:13,952
I don't like you, do I?

248
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,790
I have no idea,

249
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:21,027
but I can assure
you, you will hate me.

250
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:42,187
Ahh!

251
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:43,347
Hello!

252
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:45,116
Ahh!

253
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:46,191
You did it.

254
00:13:46,292 --> 00:13:48,989
What an achievement,
huh? Two humans!

255
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:52,155
Task 764 is usually
what trips your kind up.

256
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:54,996
But, hey, as we say
in Linear Base Binary,

257
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:57,627
"Infinite time is just
a parabolic lost sock."

258
00:13:58,104 --> 00:13:59,595
Right?

259
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:04,039
Right?

260
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:07,873
You do speak

261
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,448
Linear Base Binary, don't you?

262
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,154
No? Then how did
you complete Task 764

263
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,348
or the rest of the 1,293?

264
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:17,720
Okay, so we're not on a quest.

265
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:19,383
We were. Yeah, last year.

266
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:20,869
Crushed it. Totally,
except for the part

267
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:22,004
that we're trying to fix now.

268
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,223
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

269
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,507
How do you have the
Resonant Singularity Scroll?

270
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,659
Kind of by accident.

271
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,435
My fish magicks went off and...

272
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,731
No, don't.

273
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:35,400
I was not trained
for this eventuality.

274
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,339
We just want to
talk to an Old God.

275
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,212
Do you now?

276
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:45,246
Let me explain this in a way
that you might understand.

277
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,520
A chihuahua

278
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,085
just demanded a
blowjob from an archangel.

279
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:56,528
Hmm? Also I am not explaining
fish magicks to my bosses.

280
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,530
It's a real...

281
00:14:58,598 --> 00:14:59,964
Also

282
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,295
tee time.

283
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:04,198
No, come on. No,
hang on! Hang on.

284
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,190
Look, we need the Old
Gods, but they need us too!

285
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:08,739
Need you? Hubris much?

286
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:11,771
Five minutes? Please.

287
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,490
So the Old Gods wouldn't maybe
be a little bit motivated to help

288
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:15,777
once we told them about the...

289
00:15:15,882 --> 00:15:18,875
Not really. Those monsters...

290
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:23,089
Sorry nobody told you,
but they can't be killed.

291
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:25,057
Then why create them at all?

292
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,286
Why are nickels
bigger than dimes?

293
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:30,560
Huh. Why are nickels
bigger than dimes?

294
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,310
Stop. Wait, so there's
no way to stop them?

295
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:34,493
Yes!

296
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:39,763
You said kill. They
can be stopped.

297
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:42,464
And can you think
of any good reason

298
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:46,273
why your bosses
wouldn't want us to do that?

299
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:50,014
I mean, if they don't have
to actually do anything,

300
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,209
can't hurt.

301
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,947
Okay, boys, here's my advice.

302
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,658
Drop 'em in the Seam.

303
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:04,162
The Seam?

304
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,300
This is ridiculous!
You're imbeciles!

305
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,167
Not arguing that, but the Seam

306
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,337
between what exactly?

307
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:18,336
This universe and,
you know, the antiverse.

308
00:16:18,678 --> 00:16:20,010
Where everything's all dead?

309
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:21,671
Oh.

310
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:24,650
So we go to the dead-verse?

311
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:28,246
Duck-on-a-muffin! No!

312
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:31,582
You go up to the Seam,
you drop the suckers in.

313
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:34,257
And that would be

314
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:37,121
where? Use your heads, guys.

315
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,231
The Seam's not quite sealed.

316
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,664
What could that mean? Oh!

317
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:44,032
Maybe it leaked and created
a weird little pocket world

318
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:46,970
where everything's all
backwards and lifeless.

319
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:48,500
Like the Mirror World?

320
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:50,668
Sure, not a bad name.

321
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,642
So you go there,
you find the Seam,

322
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:55,375
and whatever you toss in

323
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:57,473
will never ever
come back out again.

324
00:16:57,917 --> 00:17:00,318
I am insanely late.

325
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:02,177
Here you go.

326
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,355
To the victors.

327
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,859
Cake.

328
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,796
Okay, but the Mirror
Realm's an entire world.

329
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,430
How are we gonna find the Seam?

330
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:17,536
God damn it.

331
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,196
I don't think I could ever
eat non-Old God cake again.

332
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:21,964
Perfection is a curse.

333
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:26,278
Oh. Right.

334
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:29,144
Find the Seam. Guy didn't say.

335
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,559
We don't have
to go looking for it.

336
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,017
I think I know where it is.

337
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:38,520
There's this place, this door,

338
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:42,187
and what's behind
it felt different.

339
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:43,519
"Different," like?

340
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:46,097
Like I knew I shouldn't go
near it even when I was a Niffin.

341
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:49,059
Well, perfect, we should
definitely all walk right in there.

342
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:52,464
So according to Fogg, The
Monster's out there right now,

343
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:54,767
<i>confused for as long
as that spell will last.</i>

344
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:57,571
23, if you can
travel us out there,

345
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:59,737
we have an opportunity
to surprise him.

346
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,045
Now this is where we
open up the room for pitches,

347
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,209
because I accidentally
lost all my fish magicks,

348
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:07,378
and now none of us has
the juice to do the bond.

349
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,046
Well, what about Dean Fogg?

350
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:11,041
I mean, he's got to have
an extra battery, right?

351
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:12,637
Uh, nothing powerful
enough. We asked.

352
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:14,517
There has to be something else.

353
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:17,122
There is.

354
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:19,858
Hedge witches.

355
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:21,765
Can barely tie their shoes.

356
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:23,062
Fuck you.

357
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,600
And also, you're wrong.

358
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:27,065
A huge untapped pool.

359
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:28,698
Look, they're used to crumbs

360
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,303
and, yes, ambient is low,

361
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:33,410
but you know what amplifies it?

362
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,872
Cooperative magic.

363
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,045
We tell everyone,

364
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:40,444
and I mean all over the
world, wherever there's a pipe,

365
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,444
Fillory, even,

366
00:18:43,222 --> 00:18:46,351
and we all do the same
thing at the same time.

367
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:49,224
You can't get that many
people to cooperate.

368
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:51,254
This isn't <i>Sesame Street.</i>

369
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,489
There are some shitty hedges,

370
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,211
but there are enough good
ones that we could pull this off,

371
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:57,601
and we need them.

372
00:18:58,004 --> 00:19:00,098
Kady's right, this
is a good idea.

373
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,673
We need a way to get the
message out fast, to time it right.

374
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:04,453
Yeah. I've got
someone who can help.

375
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,469
They'd have to keep
casting the entire time

376
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:08,657
so we can keep The
Monsters in the bottles

377
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:10,001
till we get them
through the Seam.

378
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:13,684
This is right on the hairy edge
of what I'd even call a plan.

379
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,352
Hey, Q, can we talk for a sec?

380
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:19,457
Yeah.

381
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:20,754
I've been thinking...

382
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,522
Me too. I think that, um,

383
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:25,120
you should tell me where
the Seam is so that I can do it.

384
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:26,426
Why you?

385
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:30,701
Because I'm
better equipped to...

386
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:35,705
Because I want you to be safe.

387
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,871
I want you to be safe.

388
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:50,322
Are you saying that you...
No, I'm saying that we've...

389
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,055
We've tried the whole
"saving each other" thing

390
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,288
with mixed results.

391
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:01,063
Yeah. Sure, but I...

392
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:02,795
I've been thinking
about what works best,

393
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:07,064
and I think... No, I know we
are best when we're a team.

394
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:10,675
Okay, when me and you together.

395
00:20:14,146 --> 00:20:15,876
If nothing else, I
like the sound of it.

396
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,517
Because it's true.

397
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:21,647
So it's decided?

398
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:25,554
Okay, people, let's do this.

399
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:27,354
If you need to touch
butts, make it quick,

400
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:29,588
we got a multiverse to save.

401
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:32,422
How does she know our thing?

402
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:48,571
Stop torturing yourself.

403
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:53,511
I want to help. Julia,
it's gonna be okay.

404
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,089
Or it won't.

405
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:00,390
You're just zen because
you think this is it.

406
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:04,393
What other Penny told you,
some big thing you have to do.

407
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,363
No.

408
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:09,402
I'm zen 'cause there's a
lot scarier shit than dying.

409
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:13,003
And right now, I'm
looking at you, so I'm good.

410
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:20,035
Bye, Julia.

411
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,775
Bye.

412
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:40,055
There's something I
want you to know, sister.

413
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:46,437
This world, it's not just the bad
things or the ones who wronged us.

414
00:21:48,574 --> 00:21:50,543
There is...

415
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:56,010
There is such
beauty in everything.

416
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:58,442
Even the quiet,

417
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,811
especially the quiet.

418
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:18,469
Hey!

419
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,031
Hey, motherfucker!

420
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:32,780
Eliot.

421
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:34,653
Eliot?

422
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:36,287
Eliot, stay with me.

423
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:44,755
Now!

424
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,192
Eliot!

425
00:22:57,142 --> 00:23:02,706
<i>Ooh</i>

426
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:06,513
<i>All this time when we walk</i>

427
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:10,078
<i>We won't feel</i>

428
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:13,648
<i>But sometime in a box</i>

429
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:17,857
<i>It won't steal you</i>

430
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,923
<i>Oh, this time when I walk</i>

431
00:23:21,033 --> 00:23:24,993
<i>I won't feel, I won't feel</i>

432
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,404
<i>Oh, this time when I talk</i>

433
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:32,467
<i>It's not real, it's not real</i>

434
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:34,877
<i>Not real</i>

435
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,514
Eliot.

436
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,076
If there's a tunnel
with Grandma,

437
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:42,764
tell her to piss off
and come back to me,

438
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,313
you selfish fuck! Get back here!

439
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:46,891
Eliot.

440
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,053
Eliot, please.

441
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:52,658
Eliot!

442
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,797
Well, when you put it
so sweetly, Bambi, hmm?

443
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:01,064
Do something, please!

444
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,684
They need all the
ambient for those bottles.

445
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:05,041
What is the point of being a
magician if you can't use it?

446
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,688
Before I was a magician,
I was a trauma surgeon.

447
00:24:06,712 --> 00:24:08,823
I'm perfectly capable of saving
him the old-fashioned way.

448
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:10,645
If you need to cry, go outside.

449
00:24:19,391 --> 00:24:21,860
They holding? Yeah, for
now, but we have to hurry.

450
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:41,077
Okay, home is
right through here.

451
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:43,982
We do this, we move quick.

452
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:46,050
Okay, remember, no traveling

453
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:47,876
and no magic.

454
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,387
It goes bad fast here.

455
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:12,008
Alice? Just give me a sec.

456
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:13,971
We'll listen to
your gut next time.

457
00:25:26,592 --> 00:25:29,528
It's the lab. Why?

458
00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:31,356
Who cares?

459
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:39,737
Careful.

460
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,980
That's it.

461
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:51,612
It's the Seam.

462
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:00,219
Okay, let's do this.

463
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:14,700
Okay, let me...

464
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:17,875
Everett.

465
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:24,416
Quentin...

466
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:26,877
That's mine.

467
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,115
Hand it over, please.

468
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:31,356
You know you can't cast in here.

469
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,721
I know.

470
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,452
Mutually assured destruction.

471
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:40,799
Which is why
you'll give it to me.

472
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:51,037
You tried.

473
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,276
You did. I'm impressed.

474
00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:55,412
But that bond won't hold.

475
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:57,081
Give it to me before
The Monster gets out

476
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,051
and everything goes
far more shit-shaped.

477
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,358
Quentin, I think you need to...

478
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,712
Your friend Eliot is
safe. I'll let you go.

479
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,622
Just let me handle this.

480
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:07,983
You'll become a god.

481
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:10,958
And you've met gods,
but I won't be like them.

482
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:14,997
I studied them so I
could do better, be better.

483
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:17,259
Trust me.

484
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,305
Okay.

485
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,299
Okay, I get it.

486
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,269
Okay.

487
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:32,118
You always were smarter than
the books gave you credit for.

488
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:33,976
It'll be okay, Q.

489
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:36,314
In fact, you'll go
down as a hero.

490
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:37,979
I'll make sure of it.

491
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,452
Take her, do it now.

492
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,386
No... No!

493
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:45,958
What did you do? Just
some minor mending.

494
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:47,691
Quentin! Give it to me!

495
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:18,641
Hey.

496
00:30:19,951 --> 00:30:21,146
Been awhile.

497
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:25,584
Welcome to the Underworld.

498
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:28,692
Oh, shit.

499
00:30:30,796 --> 00:30:32,094
Really?

500
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,133
What's this?

501
00:30:38,804 --> 00:30:40,067
Hot chocolate.

502
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:45,974
I'm dead, but there's
still hot chocolate.

503
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,871
That's a good sign.

504
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:55,449
What did I do?

505
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:59,018
What do you think you did?

506
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,828
I don't know. It
happened so fast.

507
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,799
This is the part
where I can't lie, right?

508
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:18,501
I mean, my whole life is...

509
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:20,268
Revealed.

510
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:26,046
But it only means anything
if you reveal it to yourself.

511
00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:29,915
Okay.

512
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:32,081
Um...

513
00:31:36,528 --> 00:31:40,090
Most of my life, I've been
in and out of hospitals and...

514
00:31:43,335 --> 00:31:44,598
You know,

515
00:31:45,537 --> 00:31:48,006
just suicidal
thoughts and notes.

516
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,107
A lot of notes.

517
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:53,935
Attempts and...

518
00:31:57,516 --> 00:32:00,384
Meds and therapy and then...

519
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:04,889
Then I found Brakebills.

520
00:32:07,526 --> 00:32:09,290
And all that went away.

521
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:15,566
I thought, but...

522
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:17,794
But?

523
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:24,902
Did I do something
brave to save my friends

524
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:29,109
or did I finally find
a way to kill myself?

525
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:34,313
Okay.

526
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,152
I can see we're going to need

527
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:38,120
the deluxe package,
which... It's okay.

528
00:32:38,223 --> 00:32:39,486
No surprise.

529
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:42,658
Let's go.

530
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,430
I don't know what to say.

531
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,026
I mean, what words
are ever going to...

532
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:19,622
They won't.

533
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,177
<i>We're talking away</i>

534
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:47,518
<i>I don't know what I'm to say</i>

535
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,385
<i>I'll say it anyway</i>

536
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:55,198
<i>Today's another day to find you</i>

537
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:57,602
<i>Shying away</i>

538
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:02,173
<i>I'll be coming for
your love, okay?</i>

539
00:34:02,274 --> 00:34:07,542
<i>Take on me</i>

540
00:34:07,746 --> 00:34:09,578
<i>Take on me</i>

541
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:14,745
<i>Take me on</i>

542
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,487
<i>Take on me</i>

543
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:21,555
<i>I'll be gone</i>

544
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:28,394
<i>In a day or two</i>

545
00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:33,835
<i>So needless to say</i>

546
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:36,771
<i>I'm odds and ends</i>

547
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:38,400
<i>But that's me</i>

548
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:41,071
<i>I'm stumbling away</i>

549
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,539
<i>Slowly learning
that life is okay</i>

550
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:48,219
<i>Say after me</i>

551
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:52,916
<i>It's no better to
be safe than sorry</i>

552
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:57,929
<i>Take on me</i>

553
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:00,058
<i>Take on me</i>

554
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:05,297
<i>Take me on</i>

555
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,462
<i>Take on me</i>

556
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:12,542
<i>I'll be gone</i>

557
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:19,184
<i>In a day or two</i>

558
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,464
Wow.

559
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:40,136
Appreciate the level
of sincere grief, dude.

560
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,771
I seem to remember
when I kicked it,

561
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,603
you laughing.

562
00:35:50,415 --> 00:35:52,646
I'm really sorry about that.

563
00:35:52,851 --> 00:35:54,149
It's okay.

564
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:56,819
I've met you.

565
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:01,356
I think you know
your answer now.

566
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,852
The story for them,
it's just starting,

567
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:09,794
but it won't be the same
story because of you.

568
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,463
You didn't just
save their lives,

569
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,239
you changed their lives

570
00:36:15,974 --> 00:36:17,943
as much as they changed yours.

571
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,570
You didn't want to
leave all that, did you?

572
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:39,796
It's time to say goodbye.

573
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,299
All right, just one last look.

574
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:46,536
<i>Oh, the things that you say</i>

575
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:49,201
<i>Is it a life</i>

576
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:54,007
<i>Or just to play my worries away?</i>

577
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:58,480
<i>You're all the things
I've got to remember</i>

578
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:01,352
<i>Shying away</i>

579
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:05,557
<i>I'll be coming for you anyway</i>

580
00:37:05,757 --> 00:37:11,196
<i>Take on me</i>

581
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,889
<i>Take on me</i>

582
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:18,367
<i>Take me on</i>

583
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:20,334
<i>Take on me</i>

584
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:25,605
<i>I'll be gone</i>

585
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:32,115
<i>In a day or two</i>

586
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:40,289
<i>I'll be gone</i>

587
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:44,355
<i>In a day or two</i>

588
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,062
Are they gonna be okay?

589
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,529
Oh, yeah.

590
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,536
Once they reach here, just fine.

591
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:53,901
No, up there.

592
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,938
Oh...

593
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,475
Up there.

594
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,141
You'll notice control is done

595
00:38:02,247 --> 00:38:04,716
with the ring
finger positioning.

596
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,115
If you watch...

597
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:25,194
And the blood, it feels like

598
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,647
we're never going
to get it all out.

599
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:28,230
Then we tear down and rebuild,

600
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:31,308
which is probably long overdue.

601
00:38:31,943 --> 00:38:33,969
I got here as fast as I could.

602
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:36,076
Thank you.

603
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,375
With so few Librarians,
each is precious.

604
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:42,451
We're lucky you're still
here to run this place.

605
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:45,579
Oh, no.

606
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:47,186
No, I can't do that.

607
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:49,927
Your humility is charming,
but this isn't the time.

608
00:38:50,295 --> 00:38:52,127
I know what I'm capable of,

609
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,465
what I feel...

610
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:56,800
It should not be me.

611
00:38:57,302 --> 00:39:00,431
I know exactly who we
need, but I'm not sure they...

612
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:02,835
We need you to go find someone

613
00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:05,877
and do your very best to
convince them to come and help us.

614
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:08,169
Alice Quinn.

615
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:13,379
Eliot and Margo?

616
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:15,713
Yeah.

617
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:18,323
Almost kind of funny.

618
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:21,316
Funny "ha-ha" or funny "uh-oh"?

619
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,860
<i>God, this feels so good.</i>

620
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:25,460
It sure does.

621
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,523
Okay. Let's see what-the-what
with getting un-banished,

622
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:32,297
my throne back, and my man
for some white-hot grief banging.

623
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:35,639
I'm sorry.

624
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:38,170
That came out way
harsher than I thought.

625
00:39:38,243 --> 00:39:39,302
It's okay.

626
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:42,412
It's going to be
weird for a little while,

627
00:39:42,513 --> 00:39:44,141
so we're just
going to have to...

628
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:48,050
Margo.

629
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:58,055
The fuck did they
do to my castle?

630
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,895
Uh, pardon me, sir.

631
00:40:04,102 --> 00:40:06,196
Crazy question,

632
00:40:07,205 --> 00:40:09,970
but Fillory is still ruled by
Acting High King Fen, right?

633
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:12,606
If this is some
kind of loyalty test...

634
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:14,211
Uh, no, no. Uh...

635
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:16,339
We've just been away for awhile.

636
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:19,447
The Dark King
reigns, glory to his rule.

637
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,447
High King Fen and
Josh the Fresh Prince

638
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:23,282
were overthrown 300 years ago.

639
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:25,082
The gods curse them both.

640
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:27,683
Have a good day.

641
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:37,592
The one that I'm the
most worried about is Julia.

642
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,365
I know.

643
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:42,404
She's fought so hard for magic.

644
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:44,066
She's been in a weird place.

645
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:48,637
Then she comes to the
end of this crazy journey

646
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:51,582
and feels at peace.

647
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,782
And magic?

648
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,652
Comes from pain.

649
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:20,009
Goodbye, Q.

650
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:30,183
Q, are you doing this?

651
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:40,159
Holy shit.

652
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,530
I'm doing this.

653
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:05,387
Did you... Did
you just see that?

654
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,155
Yeah.

655
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,258
So what are you
going to do with it?

656
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:18,959
What happens next?

657
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:21,831
Learn to love the
mysteries, man.

658
00:42:23,074 --> 00:42:24,770
Can I ask you something?

659
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,700
Yes, I'm nicer.

660
00:42:28,513 --> 00:42:30,379
All that stuff that we think

661
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:33,315
protects us or motivates
us or scares us up there,

662
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,377
here it just all falls away.

663
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:40,322
You're finally just you.

664
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:44,086
You'll see.

665
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:59,043
This is as far as I go, brother.
