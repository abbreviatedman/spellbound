trying to save Julia.

174
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:37,218
- That bitch has a bulletproof body.
- Not anymore.

175
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,345
We don't even know
if Eliot's still alive.

176
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,496
PENNY 23: Yeah, it was
a shit-show.

177
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,580
You don't even know what
the hell was going on.

178
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,436
You had one fucking job...

179
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:44,565
Yeah, fuck off, Margo.

180
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,232
Oh, Jesus Herbert
Walker Christ.

181
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,638
You're predictable,
you know that?

182
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,069
JOSH: Whoa.

183
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:53,193
- MARGO: What the shit?
- Oh, my God!

184
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,901
It just came out of me
so strong.

185
00:08:56,995 --> 00:09:02,832
Guys, I think I have
some special fish magicks.

186
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,371
Oh!

187
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,294
Act out, right?

188
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,997
Or you touched the reservoir
and you got dosed up.

189
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:13,050
Yeah, that makes
a thousand times more sense.

190
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,886
But still pretty
act out worthy, no?

191
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,018
- ZELDA: Hello, Kady.
- How are you, Zelda?

192
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,099
I understand
you're angry.

193
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,274
No, see, that'd require
actual human feelings.

194
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,359
Kady...

195
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:33,779
You piece-of-shit,
pearl-clutching sociopathic...

196
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,564
None of this was
calculated on my part.

197
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,325
Everett...

198
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:42,951
I have believed in his goodness
for over a century.

199
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,033
Everett is in it
for Everett.

200
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,834
If you are right,
then all the death,

201
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,048
all of it,

202
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,339
it's on my hands.

203
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,053
Look,

204
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,268
I know you're not evil.

205
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:10,350
Just the definition
of obedience.

206
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,483
I used to be.

207
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,491
Prove it.

208
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,449
Hmm. Man, I'm good.

209
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,951
Yeah.
Great, thanks.

210
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:47,390
So you...
So you feel okay?

211
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,642
Yeah, thanks.

212
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,316
And by thanks I mean thank you
for deciding that I should age,

213
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:55,611
grow old, and probably die
from a paper cut.

214
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,697
Oh, yeah, and that I'll never
get to do magic again

215
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,194
because I'm perfect now.

216
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:01,784
Did Professor Lipson
tell you?

217
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,199
I am perfectly normal.

218
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,788
And we all know magic
doesn't come from normal,

219
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,912
so thank you for
deciding that without me.

220
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,082
I, um...
(CLEARS THROAT)

221
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,627
Have to do that thing.

222
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,302
Look, it was
a shit decision.

223
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,425
- It was my decision.
- I know.

224
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,973
Do you? 'Cause I don't.

225
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,134
I will never know.

226
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:30,722
I just know that this is
not how it was supposed to be.

227
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,144
Okay, truth,
I was selfish.

228
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,860
You were in pain

229
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,106
and it was never going to stop,
and I couldn't.

230
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,364
And you know what?

231
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:43,363
I would do it again
to not lose you again.

232
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,001
Wait.

233
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,088
(SIGHS) Penny.

234
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,929
You just stay here
and let me be pissed at you.

235
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,633
I can do that.

236
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,191
JOSH: So Everett
wants to be a god.

237
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,113
And now he's so juiced that

238
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,192
he can just rip the god power
right out of Eliot.

239
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,902
So why don't we
just let him?

240
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,989
So let that psycho book-fondler rip
The Monster out of Eliot

241
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,403
- and probably kill him?
- (SIGHS)

242
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,081
Hey, come on.
Where are you going?

243
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,004
She's pissed at me,

244
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,208
but more pissed at herself
for being so pissed.

245
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,667
She's not great
at apologizing,

246
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,821
so she's going to
walk around

247
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,323
until she calms down
and hope I forget.

248
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:47,431
She's right. Anything where
he could die is off the table.

249
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:51,014
- Hello.
- Shit! I mean, hi.

250
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,636
Where is my sister?

251
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,139
And where is the scroll?

252
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:58,271
"The scroll"?

look like again?

00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,233
Ahh!

- No.

I have no idea,

but I can assure you,
you will hate me.

You did it.

What an achievement, huh?
Two humans!

Task 764 is usually what trips your kind up.

You do speak

Linear Base Binary,
don't you?

276
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,143
No? Then how did you
complete Task 764

277
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,345
or the rest of the 1,293?

278
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:17,725
Okay, so we're not
on a quest.

279
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,351
- JOSH: We were.
- Yeah, last year.

280
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:20,878
- Crushed it.
- Totally, except for the part

281

that we're trying
to fix now.

Wait, wait, wait,
hold on.

00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,507
How do you have the
Resonant Singularity Scroll?

284
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,648
Kind of by accident.

285
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,447
My fish magicks
went off and...

286
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,743
No, don't.

287
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:35,406
I was not trained
for this eventuality.

288
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,328
We just want to talk
to an Old God.

A chihuahua

00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,096
just demanded a blowjob
from an archangel.

Hmm? Also I am not
explaining fish magicks to my bosses.

No, come on.
No, hang on! Hang on.

be a little bit motivated to help

Sorry nobody told you,
but they can't be killed.

307
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,038
Then why
create them at all?

00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,295
Why are nickels bigger
than dimes?

00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,552
Huh. Why are nickels
bigger than dimes?

310
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,318
Stop. Wait,
so there's no way to stop them?

You said kill.
They can be stopped.

(STAMMERS) And can you think
of any good reason

315
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:46,277
why your bosses
wouldn't want us to do that?

316
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:50,026
I mean, if they don't
have to actually do anything,

317
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,194
can't hurt.

00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,947
Okay, boys,
here's my advice.

320
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,658
Drop 'em in the Seam.

321
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,169
The Seam?

322
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,297
This is ridiculous!
You're imbeciles!

323
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:11,172
Not arguing that,
but the Seam

324
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,337
between what exactly?

325
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:18,343
This universe and,
you know, the antiverse.

326
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,018
Where everything's all dead?

327
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,686
BOTH: Oh.

328
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,644
So we go to
the dead-verse?

329
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:28,235
(CHUCKLES)
Duck-on-a-muffin! No!

330
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,567
You go up to the Seam,
you drop the suckers in.

331
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,241
And that would be

332
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,114
- where?
- Use your heads, guys.

333
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,245
The Seam's not quite sealed.

334
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,664
What could that mean? Oh!

335
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,039
Maybe it leaked and created
a weird little pocket world

336
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,962
where everything's
all backwards and lifeless.

337
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,497
Like the Mirror World?

338
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,674
Sure, not a bad name.

339
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,631
So you go there,
you find the Seam,

340
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,383
and whatever
you toss in

341
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,465
will never ever
come back out again.

Okay, but the Mirror Realm's
an entire world.

How are we gonna

Oh. Right.

352
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:29,122

Guy didn't say.

353

We don't have to
go looking for it.

354
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,002
I think I know where it is.

355
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:38,506
There's this place,
this door,

356
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:42,183
and what's behind it
felt different.

357
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,514
"Different," like?

358
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:46,101

it even when I was a Niffin.

359

Well, perfect, we should definitely
all walk right in there.

360
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:52,482

The Monster's out there right now,

travel us out there,

363
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,743
we have an opportunity
to surprise him.

364
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:02,029
JOSH: Now this is where we open
up the room for pitches,

365
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,198
because I accidentally lost
all my fish magicks,

366
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:07,376
and now none of us has
the juice to do the bond.

367
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,043
Well, what about
Dean Fogg?

368
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,050
I mean, he's got to have
an extra battery, right?

369
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,653
Uh, nothing powerful enough.
We asked.

370
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,500
There has to be
something else.

371
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,128
There is.

and, yes, ambient is low,

379
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,401

what amplifies it?

380
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,860

382

at the same time.
