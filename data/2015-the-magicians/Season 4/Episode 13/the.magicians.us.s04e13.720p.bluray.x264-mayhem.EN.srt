1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,520
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:04,706
When the moment comes,
do it.

3
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:07,163
Mayakovsky told you
what your discipline is?

4
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:10,967
<i>Repair of small objects.</i>

5
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:13,420
<i>You did always excel
at minor mending.</i>

6
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:16,340
- I want you in my life.
- I want that too.

7
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,675
<i>The Binder knew Julia
had many questions.</i>

8
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:19,850
And he knew the answer.

9
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:21,769
So you can help me
become a goddess again?

10
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,472
You're hoarding magic,
trying to become a god?

11
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:27,650
By becoming one of them,
I can rip their secrets away from them.

12
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:30,316
<i>I redirected the power
I need into a reservoir.</i>

13
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,692
<i>You're saying Josh
is a fucking fish?</i>

14
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:35,053
This should fix the whole fish deal.
I'll bring Eliot back.

15
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:37,319
<i>My sister...
I need to find her a body.</i>

16
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,556
<i>So The Monster took Julia.</i>

17
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,641
<i>We need to find them.</i>

18
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:42,352
We have the axes and the demon bottles.
You have the incorporate bond.

19
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,993
Casting an incorporate bond
strong enough to hold a god

20
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,960
<i>would take
an insane amount of power.</i>

21
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,255
The question is,
who put us here?

22
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:50,460
Our parents.

23
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,544
They're more vulnerable than you think.
If we can get to their realm.

24
00:00:53,637 --> 00:00:55,299
<i>We had a key.
A scroll.</i>

25
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:58,257
Julia, if you're in there,
I'm sorry.

26
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,718
Hey, Monster

27
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,765
Lady.

28
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,073
Adorable.
So determined.

29
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,866
Maybe I'll keep you as pets.

30
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:30,748
Then again, I like my pets strong,
and you're weak.

31
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:32,503
You're already fading,
aren't you?

32
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,648
It worked.
Q, the bond.

33
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,419
I don't know how long
that's going to hold.

34
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,551
We need to
get to Brakebills.

35
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:57,719
I have something
that can help.

36
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:59,700
- We need to get her help.
- Wait, where's Eliot?

37
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,889
We can't. We don't have enough.
We have to go back to the reservoir.

38
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,154
After we get her
to a doctor.

39
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,160
No, he's right.
We have to go to the reservoir.

40
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:06,700
She's right.

41
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:13,130
Always gotta be
a fucking twist.

42
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,439
In my office,
under my desk, trap door,

43
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,108
Popper 22 to unlock.
Don't put your hand in there.

44
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:34,819
Temperature's at
absolute zero.

45
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,147
Should slow her down
a bit. Go!

46
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:39,900
You're okay.

47
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,280
You wanna
hurry that up?

48
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,308
Give her something
for the pain at least!

49
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,948
I just did. Twice.

50
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,043
- Damn it.
- Here, my last one. Use it on her.

51
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,357
You'll be okay.
Stay with me.

52
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:53,417
Thank you, Henry.

53
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,168
Restraints, please!

54
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,660
You're okay.

55
00:02:57,636 --> 00:02:58,717
What's happening
to her?

56
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:00,466
So her body,
which is very weird,

57
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,866
it keeps trying
to close the wound

58
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,051
which is heavily enchanted

59
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,410
because the weapon
was also very weird,

60
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,274
and it just tears itself
right back open again.

61
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,413
Well, make it stop!

62
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,837
I hadn't thought of that,
thank you.

63
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,606
I will use this to
keep her comfortable and...

64
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,524
How long is she
gonna be like this?

65
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,102
We are not in what I would call
charted territory right now.

66
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:22,901
I think I might know someone.

67
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,570
<i>It was
a difficult choice for Penny 23</i>

68
00:03:25,664 --> 00:03:27,280
to even call upon The Binder.

69
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,705
The Binder was certain, however,
that Penny 23 had made the right choice.

70
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,453
Julia, The Binder explained,

71
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:37,291
would remain in a cycle of wounding,
agony, for millennia.

72
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,213
Her body required
transformation.

73
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:43,922
Luckily...

74
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:48,180
...this was The Binder's expertise.

75
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,332
Well, great.
Let's get on with it.

76
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,916
The Binder
needed direction.

77
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,772
Initiate her long and arduous
journey to full goddesshood

78
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:00,104
or revert her body
to that of a mere human?

79
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,136
If it was up to me,
that'd be a no-brainer.

80
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,321
Yeah, but it's not.

81
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,030
It should be her choice.

82
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:15,454
The Binder paused for Julia
to make that choice.

83
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:21,881
Then dryly noted,
she wasn't in a talking mood.

84
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:24,963
The Binder assumed he was

85
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,888
speaking with
her husband or master?

86
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,056
No. No!

87
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,726
And yet the decision
had to be made,

88
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:31,973
surely not,

89
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:35,352
The Binder reasoned,
by this spinster nursemaid.

90
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,609
Uh, I run this hospital, Book.

91
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,771
Still, and
The Binder replied,

92
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:43,481
stating the obvious
to the strident female,

93
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,858
someone needed
to choose for Julia.

94
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,407
<i>Reed's Mark.</i>

95
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:52,457
<i>Best of bad options.
Damage was done.</i>

96
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,374
I'd rather not die,
so it's fine on that level,

97
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,505
but also...

98
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:03,585
Look, I've no interest
in being Batman,

99
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:07,297
but there comes a point when even
selfish bros need to mobilize.

100
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,303
Six hedges,
in the last 48 hours,

101
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,851
were pulled into vans
by men wearing gray.

102
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:16,064
- Woke up at home with Reed's Marks.
- Jesus.

103
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,558
The Library
just stopped pretending.

104
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:20,268
They're rounding us up.

105
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:22,399
We need you.

106
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,950
You know what
I wanted to do with my life?

107
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:30,702
To be?

108
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,750
Penny's goddamn girlfriend.

109
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:41,039
I acted tough,
but all I wanted was him.

110
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,333
You're human.

111
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,592
I'm weak.

112
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:50,174
Kady, die when
less people need you.

113
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,559
- Hey.
- Hey.

114
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,027
Honestly, I feel like
I've been run over

115
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:07,198
by six or eight trucks,
but I'm fine.

116
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:09,150
And by fine,
you mean...

117
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:11,531
What does it look like?

118
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,496
We need to talk
about The Monster.

119
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,495
His sister. I saw her plan,
her goal.

120
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:19,285
And it's way worse than slaughtering
the entire Library.

121
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,666
They want to take it up
with their parents, the Old Gods.

122
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,664
Wait, what does that
even mean?

123
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,118
I don't know,
and neither does she.

124
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,863
She just knows it would
feel good to kill them

125
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,925
and eradicate us in some sort
of insane nuclear winter

126
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:31,450
which she could give
negative three shits about.

127
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,386
Do they know how
to get to the Old Gods?

128
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:36,014
They found a spell,
uh, in the Library.

129
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,640
It opens a door
to their plane.

130
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,101
My guess is The Monster wants
to find his sister,

131
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:42,399
finish the plan,
kill the Old Gods

132
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,477
or get smashed
to a pulp trying.

133
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:46,779
That means smash Eliot.

134
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:51,151
Well, the upside
to them inhabiting our bodies

135
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,486
is she left this
in my pocket.

136
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,743
Whatever's in this
is sure to unlock the door.

137
00:06:58,293 --> 00:06:59,750
Holy shit,
well done.

138
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,378
Well, shit,
I was ready to give up.

139
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:05,923
Welcome back.

140
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,212
Oh, oh!

141
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,094
- Towel?
- Uh, yeah. Thank you.

142
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:11,921
So was it weird
being a fish?

143
00:07:12,349 --> 00:07:16,184
It felt, uh,
very natural.

144
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,311
The weird part was

145
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:30,740
how you were
so incredibly selfless

146
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:33,492
and, no offense, sweet.

147
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:37,030
- Which is...
- Not on brand? I know.

148
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,574
Anyone who
really knows me

149
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,625
knows that I'll do
anything if I love you.

150
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,294
Listen, Hoberman,
don't be stupid.

151
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:51,006
I'm not actually fun
or easy when I'm in love.

152
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,381
Fun and easy are overrated.

153
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:06,400
- Oh, Christ. Not my day.
- Oh! Uh...

154
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:09,358
Oh, hi! Sorry,
I just un-fished.

155
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,939
So, anyone else
super hungry?

156
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,700
I'm craving fish sticks.

157
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:16,986
Is that weird? You know what?
I'm just gonna go with it.

158
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:22,583
Where's Eliot?

159
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,327
Did you do it?

160
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,662
We got one so far.

161
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,497
You didn't save Eliot,
did you?

162
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:30,295
Of course you didn't.

163
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:33,010
You cocked it up
trying to save Julia.

164
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:37,218
- That bitch has a bulletproof body.
- Not anymore.

165
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,345
We don't even know
if Eliot's still alive.

166
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,496
Yeah, it was
a shit-show.

167
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,580
You don't even know what
the hell was going on.

168
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,436
You had one fucking job...

169
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:44,565
Yeah, fuck off, Margo.

170
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,232
Oh, Jesus Herbert
Walker Christ.

171
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,638
You're predictable,
you know that?

172
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,069
Whoa.

173
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:53,193
- What the shit?
- Oh, my God!

174
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,901
It just came out of me
so strong.

175
00:08:56,995 --> 00:09:02,832
Guys, I think I have
some special fish magicks.

176
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,371
Oh!

177
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:07,294
Act out, right?

178
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,997
Or you touched the reservoir
and you got dosed up.

179
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:13,050
Yeah, that makes
a thousand times more sense.

180
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,886
But still pretty
act out worthy, no?

181
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,018
- Hello, Kady.
- How are you, Zelda?

182
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,099
I understand
you're angry.

183
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,274
No, see, that'd require
actual human feelings.

184
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,359
Kady...

185
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:33,779
You piece-of-shit,
pearl-clutching sociopathic...

186
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,564
None of this was
calculated on my part.

187
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,325
Everett...

188
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:42,951
I have believed in his goodness
for over a century.

189
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,033
Everett is in it
for Everett.

190
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,834
If you are right,
then all the death,

191
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,048
all of it,

192
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,339
it's on my hands.

193
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,053
Look,

194
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,268
I know you're not evil.

195
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:10,350
Just the definition
of obedience.

196
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,483
I used to be.

197
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,491
Prove it.

198
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,449
Hmm. Man, I'm good.

199
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:27,951
Yeah.
Great, thanks.

200
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:47,390
So you...
So you feel okay?

201
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,642
Yeah, thanks.

202
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,316
And by thanks I mean thank you
for deciding that I should age,

203
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:55,611
grow old, and probably die
from a paper cut.

204
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,697
Oh, yeah, and that I'll never
get to do magic again

205
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,194
because I'm perfect now.

206
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:01,784
Did Professor Lipson
tell you?

207
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:04,199
I am perfectly normal.

208
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,788
And we all know magic
doesn't come from normal,

209
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,912
so thank you for
deciding that without me.

210
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,082
I, um...

211
00:11:13,965 --> 00:11:15,627
Have to do that thing.

212
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,302
Look, it was
a shit decision.

213
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,425
- It was my decision.
- I know.

214
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,973
Do you? 'Cause I don't.

215
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,134
I will never know.

216
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:30,722
I just know that this is
not how it was supposed to be.

217
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,144
Okay, truth,
I was selfish.

218
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,860
You were in pain

219
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,106
and it was never going to stop,
and I couldn't.

220
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,364
And you know what?

221
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:43,363
I would do it again
to not lose you again.

222
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,001
Wait.

223
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,088
Penny.

224
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,929
You just stay here
and let me be pissed at you.

225
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,633
I can do that.

226
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,191
So Everett
wants to be a god.

227
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,113
And now he's so juiced that

228
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,192
he can just rip the god power
right out of Eliot.

229
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,902
So why don't we
just let him?

230
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,989
So let that psycho book-fondler rip
The Monster out of Eliot

231
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,403
and probably kill him?

232
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,081
Hey, come on.
Where are you going?

233
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,004
She's pissed at me,

234
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,208
but more pissed at herself
for being so pissed.

235
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,667
She's not great
at apologizing,

236
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,821
so she's going to
walk around

237
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,323
until she calms down
and hope I forget.

238
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:47,431
She's right. Anything where
he could die is off the table.

239
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:51,014
- Hello.
- Shit! I mean, hi.

240
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,636
Where is my sister?

241
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,139
And where is the scroll?

242
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:58,271
"The scroll"?

243
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,776
Answer me now.

244
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,173
Um, what does it
look like again?

245
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,233
Ahh!

246
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:05,858
No.

247
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:13,950
I don't like you, do I?

248
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,784
I have no idea,

249
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:21,044
but I can assure you,
you will hate me.

250
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,190
Ahh!

251
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,361
Hello!

252
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,113
Ahh!

253
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,199
You did it.

254
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,992
What an achievement, huh?
Two humans!

255
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:52,155
Task 764 is usually what trips your kind up.

256
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,991
But, hey, as we say
in Linear Base Binary,

257
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,622
"Infinite time is just
a parabolic lost sock."

258
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,578
Right?

259
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,045
Right?

260
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,878
You do speak

261
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,429
Linear Base Binary,
don't you?

262
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,143
No? Then how did you
complete Task 764

263
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,345
or the rest of the 1,293?

264
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:17,725
Okay, so we're not
on a quest.

265
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,351
- We were.
- Yeah, last year.

266
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:20,878
- Crushed it.
- Totally, except for the part

267
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,004
that we're trying
to fix now.

268
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,235
Wait, wait, wait,
hold on.

269
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,507
How do you have the
Resonant Singularity Scroll?

270
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,648
Kind of by accident.

271
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,447
My fish magicks
went off and...

272
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,743
No, don't.

273
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:35,406
I was not trained
for this eventuality.

274
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,328
We just want to talk
to an Old God.

275
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:40,212
Do you now?

276
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:45,257
Let me explain this in a way
that you might understand.

277
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,509
A chihuahua

278
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,096
just demanded a blowjob
from an archangel.

279
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:56,511
Hmm? Also I am not
explaining fish magicks to my bosses.

280
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:58,522
It's a real...

281
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,972
Also

282
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:02,316
tee time.

283
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,192
No, come on.
No, hang on! Hang on.

284
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,198
Look, we need the Old Gods,
but they need us too!

285
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,731
Need you? Hubris much?

286
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,775
Five minutes? Please.

287
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,473
So the Old Gods wouldn't maybe
be a little bit motivated to help

288
00:15:14,497 --> 00:15:15,783
once we told them about the...

289
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,866
Not really.
Those monsters...

290
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:23,087
Sorry nobody told you,
but they can't be killed.

291
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,038
Then why
create them at all?

292
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,295
Why are nickels bigger
than dimes?

293
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,552
Huh. Why are nickels
bigger than dimes?

294
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,318
Stop. Wait,
so there's no way to stop them?

295
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,510
Yes!

296
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:39,770
You said kill.
They can be stopped.

297
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:42,473
And can you think
of any good reason

298
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:46,277
why your bosses
wouldn't want us to do that?

299
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:50,026
I mean, if they don't
have to actually do anything,

300
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,194
can't hurt.

301
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,947
Okay, boys,
here's my advice.

302
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,658
Drop 'em in the Seam.

303
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:04,169
The Seam?

304
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,297
This is ridiculous!
You're imbeciles!

305
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:11,172
Not arguing that,
but the Seam

306
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,337
between what exactly?

307
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:18,343
This universe and,
you know, the antiverse.

308
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,018
Where everything's all dead?

309
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,686
Oh.

310
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:24,644
So we go to
the dead-verse?

311
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:28,235
Duck-on-a-muffin! No!

312
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:31,567
You go up to the Seam,
you drop the suckers in.

313
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:34,241
And that would be

314
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,114
- where?
- Use your heads, guys.

315
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,245
The Seam's not quite sealed.

316
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,664
What could that mean? Oh!

317
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,039
Maybe it leaked and created
a weird little pocket world

318
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,962
where everything's
all backwards and lifeless.

319
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,497
Like the Mirror World?

320
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,674
Sure, not a bad name.

321
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,631
So you go there,
you find the Seam,

322
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,383
and whatever
you toss in

323
00:16:55,473 --> 00:16:57,465
will never ever
come back out again.

324
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:00,301
I am insanely late.

325
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,181
Here you go.

326
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,355
To the victors.

327
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,859
Cake.

328
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,782
Okay, but the Mirror Realm's
an entire world.

329
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,445
How are we gonna
find the Seam?

330
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:17,536
God damn it.

331
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:20,200
I don't think I could ever eat
non-Old God cake again.

332
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,947
Perfection is a curse.

333
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:26,292
Oh. Right.

334
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:29,122
Find the Seam.
Guy didn't say.

335
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,567
We don't have to
go looking for it.

336
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,002
I think I know where it is.

337
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:38,506
There's this place,
this door,

338
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:42,183
and what's behind it
felt different.

339
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,514
"Different," like?

340
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:46,101
Like I knew I shouldn't go near
it even when I was a Niffin.

341
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:49,051
Well, perfect, we should definitely
all walk right in there.

342
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:52,482
So according to Fogg,
The Monster's out there right now,

343
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,775
<i>confused for as long
as that spell will last.</i>

344
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,573
23, if you can
travel us out there,

345
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,743
we have an opportunity
to surprise him.

346
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:02,029
Now this is where we open
up the room for pitches,

347
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,198
because I accidentally lost
all my fish magicks,

348
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:07,376
and now none of us has
the juice to do the bond.

349
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,043
Well, what about
Dean Fogg?

350
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,050
I mean, he's got to have
an extra battery, right?

351
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,653
Uh, nothing powerful enough.
We asked.

352
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,500
There has to be
something else.

353
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:17,128
There is.

354
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:19,839
Hedge witches.

355
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:21,757
Can barely tie
their shoes.

356
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:23,058
Fuck you.

357
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:24,597
And also, you're wrong.

358
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:27,062
A huge untapped pool.

359
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,684
Look, they're
used to crumbs

360
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,312
and, yes, ambient is low,

361
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,401
but you know
what amplifies it?

362
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,860
Cooperative magic.

363
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,022
We tell everyone,

364
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:40,450
and I mean all over the world,
wherever there's a pipe,

365
00:18:41,412 --> 00:18:42,448
Fillory, even,

366
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:46,369
and we all do the same thing
at the same time.

367
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:49,202
You can't get
that many people to cooperate.

368
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,248
This isn't <i>Sesame Street.</i>

369
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,497
There are
some shitty hedges,

370
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:56,194
but there are enough good ones
that we could pull this off,

371
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,584
and we need them.

372
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:00,095
Kady's right,
this is a good idea.

373
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,677
We need a way to get the message
out fast, to time it right.

374
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,453
- Yeah.
- I've got someone who can help.

375
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,469
They'd have to keep casting
the entire time

376
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,665
so we can keep
The Monsters in the bottles

377
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,009
till we get them
through the Seam.

378
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:13,688
This is right on the hairy edge
of what I'd even call a plan.

379
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,363
Hey, Q,
can we talk for a sec?

380
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:19,449
Yeah.

381
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,740
I've been thinking...

382
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,533
Me too.
I think that, um,

383
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,112
you should tell me where the Seam is
so that I can do it.

384
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:26,413
Why you?

385
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,709
Because I'm
better equipped to...

386
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,713
Because
I want you to be safe.

387
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,882
I want you to be safe.

388
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,308
- Are you saying that you...
- No, I'm saying that we've...

389
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,061
We've tried the whole
"saving each other" thing

390
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:56,268
with mixed results.

391
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,068
Yeah. Sure, but I...

392
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,774
I've been thinking
about what works best,

393
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:07,078
and I think... No, I know
we are best when we're a team.

394
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,658
Okay, when me
and you together.

395
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,871
If nothing else,
I like the sound of it.

396
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:18,502
Because it's true.

397
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,630
So it's decided?

398
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:25,552
Okay, people,
let's do this.

399
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,348
If you need to touch butts,
make it quick,

400
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:29,597
we got a multiverse to save.

401
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:32,437
How does she
know our thing?

402
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,573
Stop
torturing yourself.

403
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:53,496
- I want to help.
- Julia, it's gonna be okay.

404
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,086
Or it won't.

405
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,374
You're just zen because
you think this is it.

406
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:04,382
What other Penny told you,
some big thing you have to do.

407
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:06,346
No.

408
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:09,391
I'm zen 'cause there's a lot
scarier shit than dying.

409
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:13,011
And right now,
I'm looking at you, so I'm good.

410
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,018
Bye, Julia.

411
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:22,779
Bye.

412
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:40,038
There's something
I want you to know, sister.

413
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:46,420
This world, it's not just the bad things
or the ones who wronged us.

414
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,549
There is...

415
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:56,021
There is such beauty
in everything.

416
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,439
Even the quiet,

417
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,811
especially the quiet.

418
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,461
Hey!

419
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:22,042
Hey, motherfucker!

420
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:32,758
Eliot.

421
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:34,638
Eliot?

422
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,261
Eliot, stay with me.

423
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:44,777
Now!

424
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,192
Eliot!

425
00:22:57,126 --> 00:23:02,713
<i>Ooh</i>

426
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,508
<i>All this time when we walk</i>

427
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:10,087
<i>We won't feel</i>

428
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,639
<i>But sometime in a box</i>

429
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:17,845
<i>It won't steal you</i>

430
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,931
<i>Oh, this time when I walk</i>

431
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:24,985
<i>I won't feel, I won't feel</i>

432
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,404
<i>Oh, this time when I talk</i>

433
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,484
<i>It's not real, it's not real</i>

434
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:34,865
<i>Not real</i>

435
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,495
Eliot.

436
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,076
If there's a tunnel
with Grandma,

437
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,770
tell her to piss off
and come back to me,

438
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,332
you selfish fuck!
Get back here!

439
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:46,883
Eliot.

440
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,051
Eliot, please.

441
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,674
Eliot!

442
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,809
Well, when you put it
so sweetly, Bambi, hmm?

443
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,062
Do something, please!

444
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,667
They need all the ambient
for those bottles.

445
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,024
What is the point of being a magician
if you can't use it?

446
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,671
Before I was a magician,
I was a trauma surgeon.

447
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,840
I'm perfectly capable of saving him
the old-fashioned way.

448
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,651
If you need to cry,
go outside.

449
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,867
- They holding?
- Yeah, for now, but we have to hurry.

450
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:41,061
Okay, home is
right through here.

451
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:43,980
We do this,
we move quick.

452
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:46,065
Okay, remember,
no traveling

453
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:47,893
and no magic.

454
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,398
It goes bad fast here.

455
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,000
- Alice?
- Just give me a sec.

456
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:13,968
We'll listen
to your gut next time.

457
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,521
It's the lab. Why?

458
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,353
Who cares?

459
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:39,744
Careful.

460
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:49,955
That's it.

461
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,626
It's the Seam.

462
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:00,219
Okay, let's do this.

463
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,691
Okay, let me...

464
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:17,867
Everett.

465
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,413
Quentin...

466
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:26,874
That's mine.

467
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,127
Hand it over, please.

468
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,337
You know
you can't cast in here.

469
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,709
I know.

470
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:36,460
Mutually assured destruction.

471
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,804
Which is why
you'll give it to me.

472
00:26:49,817 --> 00:26:51,024
You tried.

473
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,267
You did. I'm impressed.

474
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,395
But that bond won't hold.

475
00:26:55,489 --> 00:26:57,089
Give it to me before
The Monster gets out

476
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,028
and everything goes
far more shit-shaped.

477
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,359
Quentin, I think
you need to...

478
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:03,695
Your friend Eliot is safe.
I'll let you go.

479
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,622
Just let me handle this.

480
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:07,995
You'll become a god.

481
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,953
And you've met gods,
but I won't be like them.

482
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:15,006
I studied them so I could
do better, be better.

483
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,253
Trust me.

484
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:20,303
Okay.

485
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,299
Okay, I get it.

486
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:26,263
Okay.

487
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:32,107
You always were smarter
than the books gave you credit for.

488
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:33,978
It'll be okay, Q.

489
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:36,311
In fact, you'll
go down as a hero.

490
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:37,983
I'll make sure of it.

491
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,444
Take her, do it now.

492
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,409
No... No!

493
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:46,048
- What did you do?
- Just some minor mending.

494
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:47,843
- Quentin!
- Give it to me!

495
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:18,647
Hey.

496
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,150
Been awhile.

497
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,567
Welcome to the Underworld.

498
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:28,692
Oh, shit.

499
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:32,073
Really?

500
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,121
What's this?

501
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,081
Hot chocolate.

502
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:45,959
I'm dead, but there's still hot chocolate.

503
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:49,879
That's a good sign.

504
00:30:53,727 --> 00:30:55,434
What did I do?

505
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:59,018
What do you think
you did?

506
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,817
I don't know.
It happened so fast.

507
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,780
This is the part
where I can't lie, right?

508
00:31:16,458 --> 00:31:18,495
I mean, my whole life is...

509
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,288
Revealed.

510
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:26,041
But it only means anything
if you reveal it to yourself.

511
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:29,923
Okay.

512
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:32,096
Um...

513
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,104
Most of my life, I've been
in and out of hospitals and...

514
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,604
You know,

515
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:47,987
just suicidal thoughts
and notes.

516
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,107
A lot of notes.

517
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,943
Attempts and...

518
00:31:57,499 --> 00:32:00,367
Meds and therapy and then...

519
00:32:02,963 --> 00:32:04,875
Then I found Brakebills.

520
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:09,296
And all that went away.

521
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,421
I... I...

522
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:15,552
I thought, but...

523
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:17,801
But?

524
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:24,898
Did I do something brave
to save my friends

525
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:29,104
or did I finally find a way
to kill myself?

526
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,317
Okay.

527
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:36,160
I can see we're going to need

528
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:38,112
the deluxe package, which...
It's okay.

529
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,492
No surprise.

530
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:42,666
Let's go.

531
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,424
I don't know what to say.

532
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:17,026
I mean, what words
are ever going to...

533
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:19,620
They won't.

534
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:43,177
<i>We're talking away</i>

535
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:47,515
<i>I don't know what I'm to say</i>

536
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,397
<i>I'll say it anyway</i>

537
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:55,198
<i>Today's another day
to find you</i>

538
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:57,616
<i>Shying away</i>

539
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:02,155
<i>I'll be coming
for your love, okay?</i>

540
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:07,536
<i>Take on me</i>

541
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,586
<i>Take on me</i>

542
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:14,759
<i>Take me on</i>

543
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,464
<i>Take on me</i>

544
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:21,550
<i>I'll be gone</i>

545
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:28,394
<i>In a day or two</i>

546
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,815
<i>So needless to say</i>

547
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,776
<i>I'm odds and ends</i>

548
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,402
<i>But that's me</i>

549
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:41,076
<i>I'm stumbling away</i>

550
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,539
<i>Slowly learning
that life is okay</i>

551
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,205
<i>Say after me</i>

552
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:52,921
<i>It's no better to be safe
than sorry</i>

553
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:57,924
<i>Take on me</i>

554
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:00,050
<i>Take on me</i>

555
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:05,301
<i>Take me on</i>

556
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,470
<i>Take on me</i>

557
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:12,525
<i>I'll be gone</i>

558
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:19,195
<i>In a day or two</i>

559
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,464
Wow.

560
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,128
Appreciate the level
of sincere grief, dude.

561
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,760
I seem to remember
when I kicked it,

562
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,591
you laughing.

563
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,640
I'm really sorry about that.

564
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,145
It's okay.

565
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:56,819
I've met you.

566
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,364
I think you know
your answer now.

567
00:36:02,369 --> 00:36:04,861
The story for them,
it's just starting,

568
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:09,783
but it won't be the same story
because of you.

569
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:12,452
You didn't just
save their lives,

570
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,250
you changed their lives

571
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,922
as much as they
changed yours.

572
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:20,585
You didn't want to
leave all that, did you?

573
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:39,771
It's time to say goodbye.

574
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:42,277
All right,
just one last look.

575
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:46,536
<i>Oh, the things that you say</i>

576
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:49,204
<i>Is it a life</i>

577
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:54,001
<i>Orjust to play
my worries away?</i>

578
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:58,457
<i>You're all the things
I've got to remember</i>

579
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,338
<i>Shying away</i>

580
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:05,554
<i>I'll be coming for you anyway</i>

581
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:12,888
<i>Take on me</i>

582
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:18,355
<i>Take me on</i>

583
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:20,315
<i>Take on me</i>

584
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:25,617
<i>I'll be gone</i>

585
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:32,115
<i>In a day or two</i>

586
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:40,294
<i>I'll be gone</i>

587
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:44,336
<i>In a day or two</i>

588
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,053
Are they gonna be okay?

589
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,507
Oh, yeah.

590
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,513
Once they reach here,
just fine.

591
00:37:52,145 --> 00:37:53,886
No, up there.

592
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:56,935
Oh...

593
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:58,482
Up there.

594
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,152
You'll notice control is done

595
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:04,696
with the ring finger
positioning.

596
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,115
If you watch...

597
00:38:23,593 --> 00:38:25,209
And the blood, it feels like

598
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,655
we're never going to
get it all out.

599
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,215
Then we tear down
and rebuild,

600
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:31,302
which is probably
long overdue.

601
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:33,972
I got here
as fast as I could.

602
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:36,054
Thank you.

603
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,398
With so few Librarians,
each is precious.

604
00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:42,443
We're lucky you're still here
to run this place.

605
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:45,563
Oh, no.

606
00:38:45,949 --> 00:38:47,190
No, I can't do that.

607
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:49,905
Your humility is charming,
but this isn't the time.

608
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,118
I know what I'm capable of,

609
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,454
what I feel...

610
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:56,786
It should not be me.

611
00:38:57,293 --> 00:39:00,411
I know exactly who we need,
but I'm not sure they...

612
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:02,830
We need you
to go find someone

613
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:05,883
and do your very best to convince them
to come and help us.

614
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:08,169
Alice Quinn.

615
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,386
Eliot and Margo?

616
00:39:14,561 --> 00:39:15,722
Yeah.

617
00:39:16,855 --> 00:39:18,312
Almost kind of funny.

618
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,311
Funny "ha-ha"
or funny "uh-oh"?

619
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:23,854
<i>God,
this feels so good.</i>

620
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,439
It sure does.

621
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,523
Okay. Let's see what-the-what
with getting un-banished,

622
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:32,280
my throne back, and my man
for some white-hot grief banging.

623
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:35,613
I'm sorry.

624
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,164
That came out
way harsher than I thought.

625
00:39:38,251 --> 00:39:39,287
It's okay.

626
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:42,412
It's going to be weird
for a little while,

627
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,121
so we're just
going to have to...

628
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:48,050
Margo.

629
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:58,053
The fuck did they do
to my castle?

630
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,895
Uh, pardon me, sir.

631
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,193
Crazy question,

632
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:09,984
but Fillory is still ruled
by Acting High King Fen, right?

633
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:12,612
If this is some
kind of loyalty test...

634
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,196
Uh, no, no. Uh...

635
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:16,324
We've just been
away for awhile.

636
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:19,452
The Dark King reigns,
glory to his rule.

637
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,458
High King Fen
and Josh the Fresh Prince

638
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,285
were overthrown
300 years ago.

639
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:25,079
The gods curse them both.

640
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,668
Have a good day.

641
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:37,595
The one that I'm the most
worried about is Julia.

642
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,343
I know.

643
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,387
She's fought so hard
for magic.

644
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:44,064
She's been
in a weird place.

645
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:48,652
Then she comes to the end
of this crazy journey

646
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,567
and feels at peace.

647
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,782
And magic?

648
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:56,652
Comes from pain.

649
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:20,009
Goodbye, Q.

650
00:41:28,403 --> 00:41:30,190
Q, are you doing this?

651
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,154
Holy shit.

652
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,541
I'm doing this.

653
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:05,396
Did you...
Did you just see that?

654
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:08,140
- I...
- Yeah.

655
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,270
So what are you
going to do with it?

656
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:18,943
What happens next?

657
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:21,829
Learn to love
the mysteries, man.

658
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,789
Can I ask you something?

659
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,700
Yes, I'm nicer.

660
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:30,370
All that stuff
that we think

661
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:33,299
protects us or motivates us or
scares us up there,

662
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:36,377
here it just all falls away.

663
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,305
You're finally just you.

664
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,100
You'll see.

665
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:59,032
This is as far as
I go, brother.
