1
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:08,579
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:10,619
When the moment comes, do it.

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,119
Mayakovsky told you
what your discipline is?

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,954
Repair of small objects.

5
00:00:16,955 --> 00:00:19,540
You did always excel at Minor Mendings.

6
00:00:19,541 --> 00:00:22,333
- I want you in my life.
- I want that too.

7
00:00:22,334 --> 00:00:24,719
The Binder knew Julia
had many questions,

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,759
and he knew the answer.

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,923
So you can help me
become a goddess again.

10
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:30,467
You're hoarding magic,
trying to become a god?

11
00:00:30,468 --> 00:00:31,779
By becoming one of them,

12
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:33,679
I can rip their secrets away from them.

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,348
I redirected the power I
need into a reservoir.

14
00:00:36,349 --> 00:00:38,639
You're saying Josh is a fuckin' fish?

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,959
This should fix the whole fish deal.

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,978
I'll bring Eliot back.

17
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:43,313
My sister... I need to find her body.

18
00:00:43,314 --> 00:00:45,774
- So the Monster took Julia.
- We need to find them.

19
00:00:45,775 --> 00:00:47,192
We have the axes and the demon bottles.

20
00:00:47,193 --> 00:00:49,519
- You have the incorporate bond.
- Casting an incorporate bond

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,579
strong enough to hold a god

22
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,990
would take an insane amount of power.

23
00:00:52,991 --> 00:00:55,367
The question is who put us here?

24
00:00:55,368 --> 00:00:56,451
Our parents.

25
00:00:56,452 --> 00:00:58,161
They're more vulnerable than you think,

26
00:00:58,162 --> 00:00:59,580
if we can get to their realm.

27
00:00:59,581 --> 00:01:01,399
We had a key, the scroll.

28
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,252
Julia, if you're in there, I'm sorry.

29
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,713
Hey, monster...

30
00:01:07,714 --> 00:01:09,756
lady.

31
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:22,079
Adorable. So determined.

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,840
Maybe I'll keep you as pets.

33
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:35,670
Then again, I like my pets strong,

34
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:36,742
and you're weak.

35
00:01:36,743 --> 00:01:38,494
You're already fading, aren't you?

36
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,639
It worked. Cue the bond.

37
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,479
I don't know how long
it's going to hold.

38
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,659
We need to get to Brakebills.

39
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,699
I have something that can help.

40
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,679
- We need to get her help.
- Wait, where's Eliot?

41
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,399
We don't even have enough.
We have to go back

42
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,200
- to the Reservoir.
- After we get her to a doctor.

43
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,149
No, he's right. We have
to go to the reservoir.

44
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,700
She's right.

45
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,117
Always gotta be a fucking twist.

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.addic7ed.com</font> --

47
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:36,426
In my office, under my desk, trap door,

48
00:02:36,427 --> 00:02:39,096
Popper 22 to unlock. Don't
put your hand in there.

49
00:02:39,097 --> 00:02:40,820
Temperature's at absolute zero.

50
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:43,183
Should slow her down a bit. Go!

51
00:02:43,184 --> 00:02:46,139
You're okay.

52
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,240
You wanna hurry that up?

53
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,999
Give her something for
the pain at least!

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,079
Yeah, I just did. Twice.

55
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,460
Damn it.

56
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,050
Here, my last one. Use it on her.

57
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:58,150
You'll be okay. Stay with me.

58
00:02:58,157 --> 00:02:59,408
Thank you, Henry.

59
00:02:59,409 --> 00:03:01,199
Restraints, please!

60
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,419
You're okay. What's happening to her?

61
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,409
So her body, which is very weird,

62
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,699
it keeps trying to close the wound

63
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,709
which is heavily enchanted

64
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,279
because the weapon was also very weird,

65
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,199
and it just tears itself
right back open again.

66
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,169
- Well, make it stop!
- I hadn't thought of that.

67
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,439
Thank you.

68
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,169
I will use this to keep
her comfortable and...

69
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,560
How long is she gonna be like this?

70
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,899
We are not in what I would call

71
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,060
charted territory right now.

72
00:03:27,186 --> 00:03:29,209
I think I might know someone.

73
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,606
It was a difficult choice for Penny 23

74
00:03:31,607 --> 00:03:33,314
to even call upon The Binder.

75
00:03:33,315 --> 00:03:34,699
The Binder was certain, however,

76
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,660
that Penny 23 had made the right choice.

77
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,440
Julia, The Binder explained,

78
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:43,326
would remain in a cycle of
wounding, agony for millennia.

79
00:03:43,327 --> 00:03:46,706
Her body required transformation.

80
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:49,917
Luckily...

81
00:03:49,918 --> 00:03:52,319
this was The Binder's...

82
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,510
expertise.

83
00:03:55,339 --> 00:03:57,150
Well, great. Let's get on with it.

84
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:58,800
The Binder needed direction:

85
00:03:58,801 --> 00:04:01,649
Initiate her long and arduous journey

86
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,299
to full goddesshood

87
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,100
or revert her body to
that of a mere human?

88
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,079
If it was up to me,
that'd be a no brainer.

89
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,300
Yeah, but it's not.

90
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:15,020
It should be her choice.

91
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:21,460
The Binder paused for Julia
to make that choice.

92
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:27,820
Then dryly noted she
wasn't in a talking mood.

93
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:32,269
The Binder assumed he was
speaking with her husband

94
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:34,819
- or master?
- No. No!

95
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,619
And yet the decision had to be made...

96
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,719
surely not, The Binder reasoned,

97
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,259
by this spinster nursemaid.

98
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,679
Uh, I run this hospital, book.

99
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,659
Still, The Binder replied,

100
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,699
stating the obvious to
the strident female,

101
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,820
someone needed to choose for Julia.

102
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,499
Reed's Mark.

103
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,420
Best of bad options. Damage was done.

104
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:03,490
I'd rather not die, so
it's fine on that level,

105
00:05:03,491 --> 00:05:06,280
but also...

106
00:05:06,285 --> 00:05:09,639
look, I've no interest in being Batman,

107
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,779
but there comes a point

108
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,880
when even selfish bros need to mobilize.

109
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:17,730
Six hedges in the last 48
hours were pulled into vans

110
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:19,060
by men wearing gray.

111
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,319
Woke up at home with Reed's Marks.

112
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,539
Jesus.

113
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,553
The Library just stopped pretending.

114
00:05:24,554 --> 00:05:27,029
They're rounding us up.

115
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,360
We need you.

116
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:35,040
You know what I wanted
to do with my life?

117
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:37,209
To be?

118
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:42,040
Penny's goddamn girlfriend.

119
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:47,659
I acted tough, but all I wanted was him.

120
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,620
You're human.

121
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:52,349
I'm weak.

122
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:56,160
Kady, die when less people need you.

123
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:08,339
- Hey.
- Hey.

124
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,939
Honestly, I feel like I've been run over

125
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,199
by six or eight trucks, but I'm fine.

126
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,160
And by fine, you mean...

127
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,390
What does it look like?

128
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,539
We need to talk about the Monster.

129
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,479
His sister. I saw her plan,

130
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,260
her goal. It's way worse than
slaughtering the entire Library.

131
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,699
They want to take it up with
their parents, the Old Gods.

132
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,659
Wait, what... what does that even mean?

133
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,077
I don't know, and neither does she.

134
00:06:31,078 --> 00:06:32,787
She just knows it would
feel good to kill them

135
00:06:32,788 --> 00:06:35,699
and eradicate us in some sort
of insane nuclear winter

136
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,370
which she could give
negative three shits about.

137
00:06:37,376 --> 00:06:39,419
Do they know how to get to the Old Gods?

138
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,940
They found a spell in the Library.

139
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:43,632
It opens a door to their plane.

140
00:06:43,633 --> 00:06:46,099
My guess is the Monster
wants to find his sister,

141
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,979
finish the plan, kill the Old Gods

142
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,279
or get smashed to a pulp trying.

143
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,780
That means smash Eliot.

144
00:06:54,393 --> 00:06:57,103
The upside to them
inhabiting our bodies is...

145
00:06:57,104 --> 00:07:00,390
she left this in my pocket.

146
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:03,520
Whatever's in this is
sure to unlock the door.

147
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,730
Holy shit, well done.

148
00:07:05,738 --> 00:07:08,400
Well, shit, I was ready to give up.

149
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:11,909
Welcome back.

150
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,240
Oh, oh!

151
00:07:13,842 --> 00:07:16,079
- Towel?
- Uh, yeah. Thank you.

152
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,319
So was it weird being a fish?

153
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,849
It felt, uh,

154
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:22,540
very... natural.

155
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,280
The weird part was...

156
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:37,519
How you were so incredibly selfless

157
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,480
and, no offense, sweet.

158
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,879
Which is...

159
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,120
Not on brand? I know.

160
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,659
Anyone who really knows me

161
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,600
knows that I'll do
anything if I love you.

162
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,260
Listen, Hoberman, don't be stupid.

163
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:57,239
I'm not actually fun or
easy when I'm in love.

164
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,309
Fun and easy are overrated.

165
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:10,879
Oh, Christ.

166
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,359
- Not my day.
- Oh! Uh...

167
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,279
Oh, hi! Sorry, I just un-fished.

168
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,980
So anyone else super hungry?

169
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,719
I... I... I'm craving fishsticks.

170
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,939
Is that weird? You know what?
I'm just gonna go with it.

171
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:28,862
Where's Eliot?

172
00:08:28,863 --> 00:08:31,169
Did you do it?

173
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,759
We got one so far.

174
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,510
You didn't save Eliot, did you?

175
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,411
Of course you didn't.

176
00:08:36,412 --> 00:08:39,260
You cocked it up trying to save Julia.

177
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:42,719
That bitch has a bulletproof body.

178
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,919
- Not anymore.
- We don't even know

179
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,839
- if Eliot's still alive.
- Yeah, it was a shit-show.

180
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,179
You don't even know what
the hell was going on.

181
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,459
You had one fucking job...

182
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,439
- Yeah, fuck off, Margo.
- Oh, Jesus Herbert

183
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,597
Walker Christ... you're
predictable, you know that?

184
00:08:54,598 --> 00:08:56,079
Whoa!

185
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,579
What the shit?

186
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,309
Oh, my God!

187
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:02,889
It just came out of me so strong.

188
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:07,520
Guys, I think I have some special

189
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,120
fish magicks.

190
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,550
Oh, act out, right?

191
00:09:13,554 --> 00:09:15,960
Or you touched the Reservoir,
and you got dosed up.

192
00:09:15,964 --> 00:09:19,079
Yeah, that makes a
thousand times more sense.

193
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,940
But still pretty act out worthy, no?

194
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,540
Hello, Kady.

195
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:29,999
How are you, Zelda?

196
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,339
I understand you're angry.

197
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:35,110
No, see, that'd require
actual human feelings.

198
00:09:35,117 --> 00:09:37,780
- Kady.
- You piece of shit

199
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:40,849
pearl-clutching sociopathic...

200
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,500
None of this was calculated on my part.

201
00:09:43,896 --> 00:09:46,160
Everett?

202
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:49,879
I have believed in his
goodness for over a century.

203
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,120
Everett is in it for Everett.

204
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:58,569
If you are right, then all the death,

205
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:01,699
all of it,

206
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,360
it's on my hands.

207
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:10,580
Look...

208
00:10:10,589 --> 00:10:13,070
I know you're not evil.

209
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:17,499
Just the definition of obedience.

210
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:21,450
I used to be.

211
00:10:24,603 --> 00:10:27,289
Prove it.

212
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:30,440
Hmm, man, I'm good.

213
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,220
Yeah. Great, thanks.

214
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,979
So you... you feel okay?

215
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,440
Yeah, thanks.

216
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:00,630
And by thanks I mean thank you
for deciding that I should age,

217
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:02,765
grow old, and probably
die from a paper cut.

218
00:11:02,766 --> 00:11:05,910
Oh, yeah, and that I'll
never get to do magic again

219
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,395
because I'm perfect now.

220
00:11:07,396 --> 00:11:09,189
Did Professor Lipson tell you?

221
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,540
I am perfectly normal.

222
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,839
And we all know that magic
doesn't come from normal,

223
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,980
so thank you for deciding
that without me.

224
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:21,039
I, um...

225
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,100
have to do that thing.

226
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:27,291
Look, it was a shit decision.

227
00:11:27,292 --> 00:11:28,739
It was my decision.

228
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,619
- I know.
- Do you?

229
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,669
'Cause I don't.

230
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,879
I will never know.

231
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,926
I just know that this is not
how it was supposed to be.

232
00:11:37,927 --> 00:11:40,670
Okay, truth, I was selfish.

233
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:43,149
You were in pain and it
was never going to stop,

234
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,160
and I couldn't.

235
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,380
And you know what?

236
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:51,010
I would do it again to
not lose you again.

237
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,260
Wait.

238
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,080
Penny.

239
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,620
You just stay here and
let me be pissed at you.

240
00:12:13,141 --> 00:12:15,755
I can do that.

241
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,239
So Everett wants to be a god.

242
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,840
And now he's so juiced

243
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:31,139
that he can just rip the god
power right out of Eliot.

244
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,899
So why don't we just let him?

245
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,619
So let that psycho book-fondler

246
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,320
rip the Monster out of Eliot
and probably kill him?

247
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,979
Hey, come on. Where are you going?

248
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,640
She's pissed at me

249
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,259
but more pissed at herself
for being so pissed.

250
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,669
She's not great at apologizing,

251
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:50,439
so she's going to walk
around until she calms down

252
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,749
- and hope I forget.
- She right.

253
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,627
Anything where he could
die is off the table.

254
00:12:54,628 --> 00:12:57,999
- Hello.
- Shit! I mean, hi.

255
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,359
Where is my sister?

256
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,093
And where is the scroll?

257
00:13:02,094 --> 00:13:05,259
The scroll?

258
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,119
- Answer me now.
- Um, uh...

259
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,129
what does it look like again?

260
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:09,380
Ah!

261
00:13:10,853 --> 00:13:13,187
No.

262
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,879
I don't like you. Do I?

263
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,259
I have no idea,

264
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:28,120
but I can sure you, you will hate me.

265
00:13:41,508 --> 00:13:43,468
- Aah!
- Aah!

266
00:13:43,469 --> 00:13:44,469
_

267
00:13:49,404 --> 00:13:50,933
Hello!

268
00:13:50,934 --> 00:13:53,144
You did it.

269
00:13:53,145 --> 00:13:56,160
What an achievement, huh? Two humans!

270
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,810
Task 764 is usually what
trips your kind up.

271
00:13:58,817 --> 00:14:01,750
But, hey, as we say in
the Linear Base Binary,

272
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:04,260
"Infinite time is just a
parabolic lost sock."

273
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:07,300
Right?

274
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,080
Right?

275
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,160
You do speak... Linear
Base Binary, don't you?

276
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:21,249
No? Then how did you complete Task 764

277
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,259
or the rest of the 1,293?

278
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,839
Okay, so we're not on a quest.

279
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,419
- We were.
- Yeah, last year.

280
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,859
- Crushed it.
- Totally, except for the part

281
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:28,880
that we're trying to fix now.

282
00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:30,279
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on.

283
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,599
How do you have the Resonant
Singularity Scroll?

284
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,602
Kind of by accident.

285
00:14:34,603 --> 00:14:37,710
My fish magicks went off and...

286
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,349
No, don't.

287
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:42,399
I was not trained for this eventuality.

288
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,260
We just want to talk to an Old God.

289
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,860
Do you now.

290
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:52,370
Let me explain this in a way
that you might understand.

291
00:14:52,371 --> 00:14:55,519
A Chihuahua...

292
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,479
just demanded a blowjob
from an archangel.

293
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,399
Hmm? Also I am not explaining
fish magicks to my bosses.

294
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,019
It's a real...

295
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,150
Also...

296
00:15:08,158 --> 00:15:09,339
tee time.

297
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,279
No, come on. No, hang on, hang on!

298
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,266
Look, we need the Old Gods
but they need us too!

299
00:15:13,267 --> 00:15:15,726
Need you? Hubris much?

300
00:15:15,727 --> 00:15:18,769
Five minutes? Please.

301
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:20,319
So the Old Gods wouldn't maybe be

302
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,900
a little bit motivated to help
once we told them about...

303
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:25,820
Ah, not really. Those monsters...

304
00:15:25,821 --> 00:15:30,032
Sorry nobody told you,
but, uh, can't be killed.

305
00:15:30,033 --> 00:15:31,993
Then why create them at all?

306
00:15:31,994 --> 00:15:34,910
Why are nickels bigger than dimes?

307
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:37,079
Huh, why are nickels bigger than dimes?

308
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,299
Stop. Wait, so there's
no way to stop them?

309
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:46,757
You said kill. They can be stopped.

310
00:15:46,758 --> 00:15:49,635
Uh, and can you think of any good reason

311
00:15:49,636 --> 00:15:53,490
why your bosses wouldn't
want us to do that?

312
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:57,059
I mean, if they don't have
to actually do anything,

313
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,687
can't hurt.

314
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,680
Okay, boys, here's my advice.

315
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,580
Drop 'em in the Seam.

316
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:11,240
The Seam?

317
00:16:11,241 --> 00:16:14,243
This is ridiculous! You're imbeciles!

318
00:16:14,244 --> 00:16:15,639
Not arguing that,

319
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:20,599
but the Seam... between what exactly?

320
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:25,296
This universe and, you
know, the antiverse.

321
00:16:25,297 --> 00:16:27,548
Where everything's all dead?

322
00:16:27,549 --> 00:16:29,129
Oh!

323
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:32,019
So we go to the... the deadverse.

324
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,449
Duck-on-a-muffin! No!

325
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:38,499
You go up to the Seam,
you drop the suckers in.

326
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,449
And that would be...

327
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,659
where?

328
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,106
Use your heads, guys.

329
00:16:44,107 --> 00:16:46,250
The Seam's not quite sealed.

330
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:48,040
What could that mean? Oh!

331
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,399
Maybe it leaked and created
a weird little pocket world

332
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,900
where everything's all
backwards and lifeless.

333
00:16:53,909 --> 00:16:55,451
Like the Mirror World?

334
00:16:55,452 --> 00:16:57,703
Sure, not a bad name.

335
00:16:57,704 --> 00:17:00,989
So you go there, you find the Seam,

336
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,559
and whatever you toss in

337
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,839
will never ever come back out again.

338
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,829
I am insanely late.

339
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,120
Here you go.

340
00:17:10,801 --> 00:17:13,310
To the victors.

341
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,820
Cake.

342
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,019
Okay, but the Mirror
Realm's an entire world.

343
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,539
How are we gonna find the Seam?

344
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,599
God damn it.

345
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,500
I don't think I could ever eat
a non-Old God cake again.

346
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:31,363
Perfection is a curse.

347
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,639
Oh, right.

348
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,159
Find the Seam. Guy didn't say.

349
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,509
We don't have to go looking for it.

350
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,660
I think I know where it is.

351
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,499
There's this place, this door,

352
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,470
and what's behind it felt different.

353
00:17:50,478 --> 00:17:51,674
Different, like?

354
00:17:51,675 --> 00:17:54,299
Like I knew I shouldn't go near
it even when I was a niffin.

355
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:57,239
Well, perfect, we should definitely
all walk right in there.

356
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,339
So according to Fogg,

357
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,549
the Monster's out there right now,

358
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:03,079
confused for as long as
that spell will last.

359
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,039
23, if you can travel us out there,

360
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,770
we have an opportunity to surprise him.

361
00:18:07,774 --> 00:18:09,960
Now this is where we open
up the room for pitches,

362
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:12,299
because I accidentally
lost all my fish magicks,

363
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,400
and now none of us has the
juice to do the Bond.

364
00:18:15,407 --> 00:18:17,069
Well, what about taking Fogg?

365
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,579
I mean, he's got to have
an extra battery, right?

366
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,702
Uh, nothing powerful enough. We asked.

367
00:18:20,703 --> 00:18:22,660
There has to be something else.

368
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,140
There is.

369
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,140
Hedge witches.

370
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:29,795
Can barely tie their shoes.

371
00:18:29,796 --> 00:18:31,079
Fuck you.

372
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,639
And also, you're wrong.

373
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,090
A huge untapped pool.

374
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:36,927
Look, they're used to crumbs

375
00:18:36,928 --> 00:18:39,990
and, yes, ambient is low,

376
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:41,474
but you know what amplifies it?

377
00:18:41,475 --> 00:18:43,100
Cooperative magic.

378
00:18:43,101 --> 00:18:45,061
We tell everyone,

379
00:18:45,062 --> 00:18:49,100
and I mean all of the world,
wherever there's a pipe.

380
00:18:49,107 --> 00:18:51,100
Fillory, even,

381
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:54,403
and we all do the same
thing at the same time.

382
00:18:54,404 --> 00:18:57,779
You can't get that many
people to cooperate.

383
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,280
This isn't "Sesame Street."

384
00:18:59,284 --> 00:19:01,702
There are some shitty hedges,

385
00:19:01,703 --> 00:19:04,299
but there are enough good ones
that we could pull this off,

386
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,950
and we need them.

387
00:19:05,957 --> 00:19:08,179
Kady's right, this is a good idea.

388
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,859
We need a way to get
the message out fast,

389
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,869
to time it right.

390
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,439
I've got someone who can help.

391
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,130
They'd have to keep
casting the entire time

392
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:16,569
so we can keep the
Monsters in the bottles

393
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:17,920
till we get them through the Seam.

394
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,729
This is right on the hairy edge

395
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,740
of what I'd even call a plan.

396
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,439
Hey, Q, can we talk for a second?

397
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,659
Uh, yeah.

398
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,799
I've been thinking.

399
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,759
Me too. I... I think that, um,

400
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,150
you should tell me where the
Seam is so that I can do it.

401
00:19:33,151 --> 00:19:35,630
Why you?

402
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:39,450
Because I'm... I'm better equipped to...

403
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,099
Because I just want you to be safe.

404
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,419
I want you to be safe.

405
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,170
Are you saying that you...

406
00:19:57,175 --> 00:19:59,170
No, I'm saying that we've...

407
00:19:59,177 --> 00:20:01,979
we've tried the whole
"saving each other" thing

408
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,740
with mixed results.

409
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:09,103
Yeah. Sure, but I...

410
00:20:09,104 --> 00:20:11,539
I've... I've been thinking
about what works best,

411
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:15,709
and I think... no, I know we
are best when we're a team.

412
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:18,660
Okay, when me and you together.

413
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,900
If nothing else, I like the sound of it.

414
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,940
Because it's true.

415
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:30,600
So it's decided?

416
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:33,586
Okay, people, let's do this.

417
00:20:33,587 --> 00:20:35,499
If you need to touch
butts, make it quick,

418
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,900
we got a multiverse to save.

419
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,560
How does she know our thing?

420
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,990
Stop torturing yourself.

421
00:20:57,999 --> 00:21:02,310
- I want to help.
- Julia, it's gonna be okay.

422
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,360
Or it won't.

423
00:21:05,368 --> 00:21:09,240
You're just Zen because
you think this is it.

424
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:12,458
What other Penny told you,
some big thing you have to do.

425
00:21:12,459 --> 00:21:14,640
No.

426
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:17,546
I'm Zen 'cause there's a lot
scarier shit than dying.

427
00:21:17,547 --> 00:21:21,550
And right now, I'm looking
at you, so I'm good.

428
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,060
Bye, Julia.

429
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,590
Bye.

430
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:49,280
There's something I want
you to know, sister.

431
00:21:49,287 --> 00:21:53,729
This world, it's not just the bad things

432
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,940
or the ones who wronged us.

433
00:21:57,295 --> 00:22:00,060
There is...

434
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:05,636
there is such beauty in everything.

435
00:22:05,637 --> 00:22:08,549
Even the quiet,

436
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:10,820
especially the quiet.

437
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,940
Hey!

438
00:22:28,994 --> 00:22:31,287
Hey, motherfucker!

439
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,920
Eliot.

440
00:22:41,923 --> 00:22:43,799
Eliot?

441
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,302
Eliot, stay with me.

442
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,920
Now!

443
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,680
Eliot!

444
00:23:47,322 --> 00:23:48,710
Eliot.

445
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,049
If there's a tunnel with Grandma,

446
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:51,739
tell her to piss off
and come back to me,

447
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,340
you selfish fuck! Get back here!

448
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,860
Eliot.

449
00:23:57,415 --> 00:24:00,390
Eliot, please.

450
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,700
Eliot!

451
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,860
Well, when you put it
so sweetly, Bambi, hmm?

452
00:24:08,239 --> 00:24:09,990
Do something, please!

453
00:24:09,991 --> 00:24:11,720
They need all the ambient
for those bottles.

454
00:24:11,721 --> 00:24:13,539
What is the point of being a
magician if you can't use it?

455
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,519
Before I was a magician,
I was a trauma surgeon.

456
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,639
I'm perfectly capable of saving
him the old-fashioned way.

457
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,429
If you need to cry, go outside.

458
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:29,439
- They holding?
- Yeah,

459
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,880
for now, but we have to hurry.

460
00:24:47,061 --> 00:24:50,280
Okay, home is right through here.

461
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:53,470
We do this, we move quick.

462
00:24:53,471 --> 00:24:55,305
Okay, remember, no traveling

463
00:24:55,306 --> 00:24:56,989
and no magic.

464
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,000
It goes bad fast here.

465
00:25:18,976 --> 00:25:21,119
- Alice?
- Just give me a sec.

466
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,180
We'll listen to your gut next time.

467
00:25:35,513 --> 00:25:39,079
It's the lab. Why?

468
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,110
Who cares?

469
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:48,940
Careful.

470
00:25:57,452 --> 00:25:59,279
That's it.

471
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,620
It's the Seam.

472
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,040
Okay, let's do this.

473
00:26:21,643 --> 00:26:24,686
Okay, let me get it...

474
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:27,820
Everett.

475
00:26:32,833 --> 00:26:37,570
Quentin... that's mine.

476
00:26:37,575 --> 00:26:39,243
Hand it over, please.

477
00:26:39,244 --> 00:26:41,369
No, you can't cast in here.

478
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:42,440
I know.

479
00:26:44,228 --> 00:26:47,210
Mutually assured destruction.

480
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:51,280
Which is why you'll give it to me.

481
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:01,960
You tried. You did.

482
00:27:01,975 --> 00:27:03,267
I'm impressed.

483
00:27:03,268 --> 00:27:05,394
But that bond won't hold.

484
00:27:05,395 --> 00:27:07,069
Give it to me before
the Monster gets out

485
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:09,020
and everything goes
far more shit-shaped.

486
00:27:09,023 --> 00:27:10,858
Quentin, I think I need you to... to...

487
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:14,430
Your friend Eliot is
safe. I'll let you go.

488
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:16,655
Just let me handle this.

489
00:27:16,656 --> 00:27:18,115
You'll become a god.

490
00:27:18,116 --> 00:27:20,993
And you've met gods, but
I won't be like them.

491
00:27:20,994 --> 00:27:25,038
I studied them so I could
do better, be better.

492
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:27,499
Trust me.

493
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:31,030
Okay.

494
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,900
Okay, I get it.

495
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,240
Okay.

496
00:27:38,678 --> 00:27:42,223
You always were smarter than
the books gave you credit for.

497
00:27:42,224 --> 00:27:43,420
It'll be okay, Q.

498
00:27:44,642 --> 00:27:46,949
In fact, you'll go down as a hero.

499
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:48,020
I'll make sure of it.

500
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,770
Take her, do it now.

501
00:27:50,773 --> 00:27:54,234
No... no!

502
00:27:54,235 --> 00:27:55,239
- No!
- What did you do?

503
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,249
Just a Minor Mending.

504
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,340
- Quentin!
- Give it to me!

505
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:30,739
Hey.

506
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,760
Been awhile.

507
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,020
Welcome to the Underworld.

508
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,820
Oh, shit.

509
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,160
Really?

510
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,639
What's this?

511
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,220
Hot chocolate.

512
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:56,539
I'm dead, but there's
still hot chocolate.

513
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,860
That's a good sign.

514
00:31:04,771 --> 00:31:06,570
What did I do?

515
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:10,020
What did you think you did?

516
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:13,880
I don't know. It happened so fast.

517
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:23,480
This is the part where
I can't lie, right?

518
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:29,739
I mean, my whole life is...

519
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,400
Revealed.

520
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:37,740
But it only means anything if
you reveal it to yourself.

521
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,959
Okay.

522
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,020
Um...

523
00:31:47,481 --> 00:31:50,359
Most of my life, I've been
in and out of hospitals

524
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:53,170
and...

525
00:31:54,321 --> 00:31:57,539
You know, just suicidal thoughts

526
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:00,580
and notes.

527
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:03,329
A lot of notes.

528
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:05,900
Attempts and...

529
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,299
meds and therapy

530
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,240
and then...

531
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,520
Then I found Brakebills...

532
00:32:18,345 --> 00:32:20,910
and all that went away.

533
00:32:22,683 --> 00:32:25,189
I...

534
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:26,560
I thought, but...

535
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,880
But?

536
00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:36,829
Did I do something brave
to save my friends

537
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:40,500
or did I finally find
a way to kill myself?

538
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,719
Okay.

539
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,999
I can see we're going to
need the deluxe package,

540
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,740
which... it's okay. No surprise.

541
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:53,909
Let's go.

542
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:05,960
I don't know what to say.

543
00:33:25,983 --> 00:33:28,486
I mean, what words are ever going to...

544
00:33:28,487 --> 00:33:30,380
They won't.

Appreciate the level of
sincere grief, dude.

572
00:35:52,893 --> 00:35:54,756
I seem to remember when I kicked it...

573
00:35:54,757 --> 00:35:56,570
you laughing.

574
00:36:00,901 --> 00:36:03,640
I'm really sorry about that.

575
00:36:03,641 --> 00:36:05,070
It's okay.

576
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,780
I'm not you.

577
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,480
I think you know your answer now.

578
00:36:12,483 --> 00:36:16,111
The story for them, it's just starting

579
00:36:16,112 --> 00:36:21,324
but it won't be the same
story because of you.

580
00:36:21,325 --> 00:36:24,160
You didn't just save their lives,

581
00:36:24,161 --> 00:36:26,760
you changed their lives

582
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:29,429
as much as they changed yours.

583
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:31,739
You didn't want to leave
all that, did you?

584
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,819
It's time to say good-bye.

585
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,200

Oh, yeah.

602
00:38:00,696 --> 00:38:02,859
Once they reach here, just fine.

603
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,000
No, up there.

604
00:38:05,859 --> 00:38:09,892
Oh... up there.

605
00:38:11,531 --> 00:38:13,530
You'll notice control is done

606
00:38:13,533 --> 00:38:15,709
with the ring finger positioning.

607
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,920
If you watch...

608
00:38:34,291 --> 00:38:35,542
And the blood,

609
00:38:35,543 --> 00:38:37,690
it feels like we're never
going to get it all out.

610
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:39,213
Then we tear down and rebuild,

611
00:38:39,214 --> 00:38:42,340
which is probably long overdue.

612
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:45,020
I got here as fast as I could.

613
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:47,240
Thank you.

614
00:38:47,242 --> 00:38:50,469
With so few Librarians,
each is precious.

615
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:53,460
We're lucky you're still
here to run this place.

616
00:38:54,908 --> 00:38:56,910
Oh, no.

617
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,189
No, I can't do that.

618
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:01,040
Your humility is charming,
but this isn't the time.

619
00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:03,910
I know what I'm capable of,

620
00:39:03,917 --> 00:39:06,319
what I feel...

621
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,780
it should not be me.

622
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,599
I know exactly who I need,
but I'm not sure they...

623
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,890
we need you to go find someone

624
00:39:13,894 --> 00:39:15,450
and do your very best to convince them

625
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,730
to come and help us.

626
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:20,630
Alice Quinn.

627
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,460
Eliot and Margo?

628
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,820
Yeah.

629
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:29,379
Almost kind of funny.

630
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:33,299
Funny "ha-ha" or funny "uh-oh"?

631
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,080
God, this feels so good.

632
00:39:35,082 --> 00:39:36,350
It sure does.

633
00:39:36,353 --> 00:39:39,749
Okay. Let's see what-the-what
on getting unbanished,

634
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:43,460
my throne back, and my man for
some white-hot grief banging.

635
00:39:45,487 --> 00:39:47,300
I'm sorry.

636
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:49,219
That came out way
harsher than I thought.

637
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,280
It's okay.

638
00:39:50,284 --> 00:39:52,360
It's going to be weird
for a little while

639
00:39:52,369 --> 00:39:55,650
so we're just going to have to...

640
00:39:57,771 --> 00:39:59,810
Margo.

641
00:40:05,174 --> 00:40:08,809
The fuck did they do to my castle?

642
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,929
Uh, pardon me, sir.

643
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:16,699
Crazy question,

644
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:21,022
but, um, Fillory is still ruled
by Acting High King Fen, right?

645
00:40:21,023 --> 00:40:23,733
If this is some kind of loyalty test...

646
00:40:23,734 --> 00:40:28,000
Uh, no, no. Uh, we've just
been away for awhile.

647
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:30,399
The Dark King reigns, glory to his rule.

648
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,719
High King Fen and Josh the Fresh Prince

649
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,285
were overthrown 300 years ago.

650
00:40:34,286 --> 00:40:36,663
The gods curse them both.

651
00:40:36,664 --> 00:40:39,160
Have a good day.

652
00:40:45,685 --> 00:40:48,717
One that I'm the most
worried about is Julia.

653
00:40:48,718 --> 00:40:50,460
I know.

654
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:53,359
She fought so hard for magic.

655
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,299
She's been in a weird place.

656
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:58,639
Then she comes to the end
of this crazy journey

657
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,640
and... feels at peace.

658
00:41:03,369 --> 00:41:05,880
And magic?

659
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:08,109
Comes from pain.

660
00:41:29,395 --> 00:41:31,844
Good-bye, Q.

661
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:41,880
Q, are you doing this?

662
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:51,160
Holy shit.

663
00:41:58,016 --> 00:41:59,579
I'm doing this.

664
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:16,950
Did you... did you just see that?

665
00:42:16,952 --> 00:42:19,474
- I...
- Yeah.

666
00:42:19,475 --> 00:42:23,630
So what are you going to do with it?

667
00:42:28,525 --> 00:42:30,520
What happens next?

668
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:33,571
Learn to love the mysteries, man.

669
00:42:33,572 --> 00:42:36,089
Can I ask you something?

670
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:37,759
Yes, I'm nicer.

671
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:42,259
All that stuff that we think protects us

672
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,319
or motivates us or scares us up there,

673
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:48,128
here it just all falls away.

674
00:42:48,975 --> 00:42:51,700
You're finally just you.

675
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,300
You'll see.

676
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:03,689
_

677
00:43:07,327 --> 00:43:10,559
This is as far as I go, brother.
