<i>Previously on</i>
The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,749
The following books have been removed
from circulation for revisions...

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,922
They're filling
in the endings of our books.

4
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,527
I'm sorry about
your friend's books, but...

5
00:00:09,551 --> 00:00:11,634
Just go while you still
have the chance.

6
00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:16,344
Technically, I have sexually
transmitted lycanthropy.

7
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,345
The other Josh
told me something terrible

8
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:19,721
was going to happen to him.

9
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:20,955
It was called
"The Quickening."

10
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,220
It's going to happen
to me, too.

11
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:23,930
- I'm...
- A full-on goddess.

12
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,649
I'm not connected
to anything anymore.

13
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:30,604
My dad and I used
to build model airplanes.

14
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:34,031
You got your hands on this,
and it ended up in 20 pieces.

15
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:36,780
Magic's gone. I went into
remission a week later.

16
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,157
You turned your back
on what happens to your dad.

17
00:00:39,248 --> 00:00:41,581
It's a voicemail from my mom.

18
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,533
Will you sit here
for a minute?

19
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:44,835
Yeah.

20
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,212
I know Bacchus. He's a friend.

21
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,379
Then you'll poison him.

22
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:52,004
You know what's incredible?
How you can be such a good friend

23
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:54,211
and such a terrible friend
at the exact same time.

24
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:56,637
Gods are so tricky.

25
00:00:56,723 --> 00:01:01,218
<i>They took this part of me
that knew things.</i>

26
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,834
How long
has he been there?

27
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:09,566
Since we got
back from Fillory.

28
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:12,611
- He brought you back?
- I was as surprised as you.

29
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:20,321
- Meanwhile, you are baking.
- Condolence muffins.

30
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,531
For Quentin?

31
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,456
His dad
just passed away.

32
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:27,707
And a bullshit yuppie pastry
is gonna help him with that?

33
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,788
A muffin is not a pastry.
It's a quickbread.

34
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,589
What the hell
is wrong with you?

35
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:35,669
I had to help The Monster murder
a friend of mine, and I'm not happy about it.

36
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:39,051
From the looks of it,
neither is he.

37
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:40,368
Well, I don't get
why he's depressed.

38
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:41,392
He got what he wanted.

39
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,014
Where's Darth Eliot?

40
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,726
She's gonna
get us all killed.

41
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:03,830
I have examined this
over and over again,

42
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:06,202
and it still won't
reveal itself to me.

43
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,535
Why can't I
remember anything?

44
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:11,121
I don't know.
Total drag, I get you.

45
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,752
But that's kind of what goes
along with a human body.

46
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,755
Aches, pains,
can't remember shit.

47
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:19,883
And since you're done with your whole deal,
I was thinking...

48
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,135
What deal
are you talking about?

49
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,555
We led you to Bacchus.

50
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,682
You killed him.

51
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:31,392
- So now that we're done-sies...
- Don't speak to me of done-sies.

52
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,226
Only Bacchus
is done-sies.

53
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,529
I'm just saying,
you got your vengeance.

54
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:38,277
Might wanna try another body.

55
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:41,777
Maybe a non-human one.

56
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,323
I don't know.

57
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,788
See if it helps with
the whole remembering thing.

58
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:48,245
I'm good.

59
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:52,795
Fuck.

60
00:03:01,473 --> 00:03:04,557
You look like you could use
a big ball of carbs.

61
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:13,688
Jesus tits,
this is a good ball of carbs.

62
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,235
I thought
you were pissed at me.

63
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:19,439
Oh, I'm not gonna pretend
I'm happy about Bacchus,

64
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:23,698
but I'm still
sorry about Eliot.

65
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:41,211
Josh?
Are you okay?

66
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,570
Oh.

67
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:58,988
Oh...

68
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:31,803
You want me to come?

69
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,017
I'm gonna miss the funeral.

70
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,015
I missed everything
leading up to it.

71
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,523
There's nothing you can say
to my mom that'll change that.

72
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,980
Well, I could say that
it's not your fault.

73
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:45,441
The way she sees it,
she's the grown-up

74
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:49,245
and I'm still making
the same kid mistakes I always did.

75
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,618
- You break things.
- I break things.

76
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,371
Parents are the worst.

77
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,461
What about you?

78
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,413
Oh, you know.

79
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,340
I was gonna look through
all the stolen books

80
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,042
Marina has stashed around.

81
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,002
See if I could find out
why I'm indestructible

82
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,837
yet can't do magic.

83
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:11,176
What about Penny?
He still, uh, sweating you?

84
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,556
- He's not sweating me.
- Oh, right.

85
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,852
He's just following you around
with that "I'm totally into you,

86
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,503
"but I'm not gonna say
anything about it" vibe.

87
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,985
- Quentin.
- What? I'm just saying.

88
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:24,940
Maybe he could help you
with the research.

89
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,399
You're a dick.

90
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,075
I am a dick.

91
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:45,593
Hey, uh... Penny 23.
Look at that.

92
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,215
That sounded real natural.

93
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,092
Why are you skittish as fuck?

94
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,423
Am I? That's... No.

95
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:51,553
What's in the bag?

96
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,305
Oh, nothing.

97
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,386
- You got blood on your face.
- What?

98
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,937
Yeah, look in the mirror.

99
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,810
Oh, no, no, no, no, don't.

100
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,961
It's not what it looks like.

101
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:02,648
Oh! It looks like
a dead animal.

102
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,480
Okay, maybe it is
what it looks like.

103
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,844
- Is this 'cause of The Quickening?
- I don't know.

104
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,110
- Well, it's something.
- Look, I don't know what to do.

105
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,223
Well, I was pretty damn clear
about one thing, wasn't I?

106
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:13,474
- You stay away from...
- Hey, guys.

107
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,455
Julia. Hey.

108
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,159
Hey, did Marina stash
any books in here?

109
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,856
- What?
- Uh... Books? No, I...

110
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,274
- I think in the... Yeah.
- The other room?

111
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:23,210
Yeah, just not in the subject
I'm looking for.

112
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,124
About god problems.

113
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:28,753
You know, like, where did they
go for magical medical advice?

114
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:31,840
Why don't I help you look,
you know?

115
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:34,342
- Uh, what about the Maenads?
- The... The Maenads?

116
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:36,894
The followers of Bacchus'.

117
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,814
They're kind of high priestess/nurses
of the gods.

118
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,687
They were always
at Bacchus' parties

119
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:44,940
and when he would get
too wrecked, which was always,

120
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,730
they pulled him out and gave
him a divine B12 shot or...

121
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:51,405
Wait, wait, so The Monster killed Bacchus
but didn't touch the Maenads?

122
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,991
They're probably
still in Fillory.

123
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,141
They were
pretty attached to him.

124
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,327
Oh, I... I can take you.

125
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,330
Yeah, that'd be great.
Um, thanks, Josh.

126
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:02,249
Yeah.

127
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,752
You get this Quickening bullshit
figured out right now.

128
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,424
Okay.

129
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:15,554
I didn't think I passed it on.
You never said anything.

130
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:19,684
Oh, I'm sorry.
Were you waiting for me to tell you?

131
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:20,875
You never disclosed
your status

132
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:22,481
to me in the first place.

133
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,603
Because you were

134
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,936
so understanding,
I thought you knew.

135
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:30,357
Uh, it was a little bit of a low point
for me, that night.

136
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,441
Oh, well, great to hear.

137
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,948
I don't mean you.

138
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,946
I was going through
a bad divorce.

139
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,451
You're the first person

140
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,033
who really seemed to get
what I was going through.

141
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:44,704
Fine, whatever.
Look... Look, I just need your help.

142
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:48,750
What is going on with me?
With us? The Quickening?

143
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,130
Well, I don't really
know everything.

144
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:55,639
You're a goddamn cryptozoology professor.
What do you know?

145
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,183
Lycanthropy is technically
a curse.

146
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,637
Transformations are tied
to the lunar cycle

147
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:05,813
and behavioral changes
are mostly non-lethal,

148
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,564
except during
The Quickening.

149
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,317
Well, that sounds
pretty, pretty bad.

150
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,945
Oh, luckily, it only happens
every 30 years or so.

151
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:17,620
In the 48 hours leading up,
all lycanthropes experience urges

152
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:21,240
starting in the form of nightmares
or even waking dreams.

153
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,621
What is the curse
trying to make me do?

154
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:27,205
Have traditional sex with
an uninfected person

155
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,879
- or kill them.
- Jesus K. LeChrist.

156
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:35,179
The urges increase as the moon
moves towards its aphelion.

157
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:38,178
The climax, as it were,
and the lycanthropic high point

158
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:41,011
of lupinity
or wolf-ness.

159
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:44,597
I took your class, Helen.
I know what lupinity means.

160
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:48,443
Why can't I just
lock myself up in a cage

161
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,019
until The Quickening passes?

162
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,696
Because that won't
satisfy the urge.

163
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,775
You need to have sex or kill
or you'll rip your own guts out.

164
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,202
That's how the curse
is ensured to spread.

165
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,495
It's quite clever, actually.

166
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:00,788
Oh, yeah, real clever

167
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,143
how I'm going to rape
or murder someone

168
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,658
in the next two days,
no matter what.

169
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:06,586
If you try to suppress it,
it's always possible you'll do both

170
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,333
or commit suicide.

171
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:11,040
Just, you know, to have
all the options on the table.

172
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,008
What the hell
am I going to do?

173
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,460
What... What are
we going to do?

174
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,301
- Have you considered Tinder?
- What? No.

175
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,225
Because I have
a really, really bad STD

176
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:24,099
and that sort of kills
the desire to sleep with anyone.

177
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,976
- So forget...
- Mmm-hmm.

178
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,273
Wait.

179
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,270
Did you do that?

180
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,482
Yes. And it worked.

181
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:35,732
- That is why I am not going crazy right now.
- Huh.

182
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,735
Oh, you are
very charming, Josh.

183
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,034
I'm sure you'll have
no trouble finding someone

184
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,614
to dance with before,
you know,

185
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,700
the wolf makes
a choice for you.

186
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,035
Good luck, Josh.

187
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,751
The Librarians don't know
I've been living here.

188
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,462
Apologies for the mess.

189
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:02,432
Oh, and, uh, for how
I brought you here.

190
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,181
I didn't mean
to be rough.

191
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,934
I just wanted to get you out of sight
before you got caught.

192
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,142
You do remember me,
don't you? I'm Christopher...

193
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,477
Plover.

194
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,859
You're the child molester
who's directly responsible

195
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,982
for Martin Chatwin
becoming The Beast.

196
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:22,533
I also wrote some
very popular books.

197
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,280
How did you
end up here anyway?

198
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,912
Oh, that's a long
and boring story.

199
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:30,703
The important thing is
we can help each other.

200
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,126
- See, I need an extra pair of hands.
- No.

201
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:38,636
And yet I know very well
that you could use my help.

202
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,464
You're trying to escape
The Order, aren't you?

203
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:42,924
From the looks of it,
we both are.

204
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:48,054
You didn't leave with Santa Claus.
Why not?

205
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:52,308
- I get sleigh-sick.
- You can say what you want.

206
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:55,607
But I know the real reason...
Oh, please don't touch that. Please.

207
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:58,235
The real reason
you stayed behind.

208
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:03,239
You were looking for your book,
yours and your friends'.

209
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,783
Do you have them?

210
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,740
The books are
in the Revision Room.

211
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,410
But I happen to know
where that is.

212
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:15,839
So you help me with my little something,
and I'll take you there.

213
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,211
Deal?

214
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:25,592
I don't know why your father
made so many of them.

215
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,768
He liked planes.

216
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,847
A creative outlet.

217
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:35,852
He's dead, Mom.
We can stop criticizing him.

218
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,404
I didn't want to be here at all, you know,
but there was no one else.

219
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,656
Molly is furious.

220
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,405
You know how
she felt about Ted.

221
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,161
I know, I'm sorry, I...

222
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,326
I was traveling and my phone died and I...

223
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,293
You're the only
millennial I know

224
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,166
who isn't buried
in his phone 24/7.

225
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,963
Are we going
to do this again?

226
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,421
What was wrong with him, huh?

227
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,551
People make friends.
That's normal.

228
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:12,222
He was normal.
I divorced him, he was so normal,

229
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,186
so where are
his goddamn friends?

230
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,525
There was no one
at the funeral.

231
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,437
I don't know.

232
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:21,981
Did he ever date?

233
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,691
Never mind.
I don't want to know.

234
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:30,456
Okay, so we pack
these boxes.

235
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,079
Yeah, unless you want
to keep all this junk.

236
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,147
I found a guy upstate.
He'll take them off your hands,

237
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,584
but you have to
get it done by tomorrow.

238
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:44,838
- I... I got it.
- Okay, just, um, be careful.

239
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,054
Don't break anything.

240
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,854
Christ on a goddamn
communion wafer.

241
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,104
It's like I'm caught in a real-life game
of marry-fuck-kill,

242
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,775
only "marry"
is off the table.

243
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:02,988
- What are you gonna do about it?
- I have no goddamn clue.

244
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:05,010
Why do you think I'm sitting
here with my head in my hands,

245
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,401
the traditional
Hoberman despair position?

246
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:10,283
Okay, then
here's a plan.

247
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,288
We're going to
fix this bullshit.

248
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,412
I don't want to add
to your problems, Margo.

249
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,062
So 'cause of that,
you're gonna sit back

250
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,877
and just let this shit
happen to you?

251
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,375
Huh?

252
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,548
This ain't prom night,

253
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,750
and the only thing
I know for sure

254
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:26,633
is you're not going to fix anything
if you nutsack out on me.

255
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:29,261
I won't nutsack out.

256
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,558
Good. That's what
I want to hear.

257
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,012
Because we are going to find
a way out of this thing,

258
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,606
or we're gonna die trying.

259
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:48,053
I'm starting to see why no one's ever
beaten this curse. It's like herpes.

260
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,241
Cockroach-in-a-nuclear-war-level
impossible to stomp out.

261
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:55,291
Well, I found some shit on a ritual
from an Indonesian tribe.

262
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:58,665
It's supposed to prevent
supernatural transformations.

263
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:02,001
Or maybe cause them.
My Indonesian sucks.

264
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:05,884
Uber alert.

265
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,008
You know, these surge prices
are really getting out of...

266
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:12,091
Oh, no. Oh, no,
no, no, no, no.

267
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,019
Okay, surge prices piss me off, too,
but are you all right?

268
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:18,101
I've always been upfront
about my L-positive status

269
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,480
with any potential partners
before anything happens.

270
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:24,649
- What's that have to do with Uber?
- Isaac wasn't.

271
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,400
Oh.

272
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:29,108
So how many people
did Isaac do doggy-style?

273
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,570
Just one, and I'm going
to go warn her now.

274
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,331
Uh-huh. Yup! What a Monday!

275
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:40,711
So this book
is used to help me locate

276
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,629
different worlds via
a cooperative spell?

277
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,707
It is called
<i>The World Book.</i>

278
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:48,010
Yes, I can read.
So it's like the encyclopedia.

279
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,255
- More like an atlas.
- What world are you looking for?

280
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:54,933
One where I can be happy,
where I can belong.

281
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:59,805
No, it's not what you think.
I'm not interested in that.

282
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,391
I just want to go somewhere
where I can do no harm.

283
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,064
I'll never do that again.
I swear on my life.

284
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,567
Yeah, well, I don't know
if I believe you.

285
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,112
I spent years
being tortured by Martin,

286
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,031
plenty of time
to think on my actions

287
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,450
and regret them.

288
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:21,745
Did you never unintentionally
hurt someone you love, Alice?

289
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,664
I never molested a child.

290
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,800
But, yes, I've done
things I regret.

291
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,712
- Don't you deserve happiness?
- No.

292
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:35,633
Oh, come on, don't be so hard on yourself.
We all deserve it.

293
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,638
I don't think you do.

294
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,888
I don't particularly
care what you think.

295
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,855
You need my help finding
the Revision Room.

296
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,558
So either you help me
with this spell,

297
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,439
or you're on your own.

298
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,691
- Who are you?
- Hi, uh, I'm Josh.

299
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,366
I'm Isaac's friend.

300
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,656
Isaac.

301
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,363
He hooked up with you
that one time.

302
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,494
Oh.

303
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,626
Right.

304
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:05,246
Look, it's a really
bad time right now.

305
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,651
Oh, uh, no, Isaac really wanted me
to talk to you about something,

306
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:11,294
and it's kind of an emergency.
So can I come in, please?

307
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:13,879
How do you
know Isaac again?

308
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,555
Oh, uh...

309
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,884
He and I met
at Jewish camp.

310
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:22,100
This is kind of weird.
I mean, why did he send a friend

311
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,500
instead of, like,
calling me himself?

312
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:27,814
- He's got, uh, laryngitis.
- So he can't text?

313
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,608
And he broke
all of his fingers.

314
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:35,117
Anyhoo, I've got to talk to you
about Isaac's problem,

315
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:39,534
which he's embarrassed because
he came down with something,

316
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,499
and he's afraid that you might have
caught it from him.

317
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:46,291
- Caught what?
- Oh, just a

318
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,129
herpes-like thing.

319
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:51,295
- He gave me herpes?
- I believe I said "herpes-like."

320
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,838
Well, what the hell is it?

321
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,448
The only way to know
if you got it is to sort of

322
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,658
go through the symptoms and see
if you've been experiencing them.

323
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,390
Okay, Josh
from Jewish camp,

324
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,560
I'm going to discuss
genital warts

325
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:05,014
and discharge with you
'cause we just met.

326
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,849
Jesus Christ. Fuck my life!

327
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:11,688
Look, have you maybe not been
feeling yourself lately?

328
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:14,524
Not really. And I'm
beginning to wonder

329
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,057
why I let you in,
in the first place.

330
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:19,532
Great, and, uh, have you
maybe been having dreams

331
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,909
that are weird and violent?

332
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,209
Maybe.

333
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,786
Right, well, this last one
might sound a little crazy,

334
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,841
but have you maybe been unable
to control yourself around guys?

335
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:34,672
Get out of my apartment.

336
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,114
Oh, wait. No, no, no.
This wasn't me

337
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,491
- trying to freak you out.
- Seriously, get out!

338
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:42,351
Okay, please, just let me help you.
I just want to help.

339
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,723
It's been a really
hard couple of days.

340
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:52,102
I've been totally freaking,
like...

341
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,649
- What's wrong with me?
- I know what you mean,

342
00:17:56,742 --> 00:18:00,326
and it's completely normal,

343
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,781
and I assure you,
this is not your fault.

344
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:08,414
That's so good to hear.
I mean,

345
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:13,169
how could I even do that
to someone else?

346
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,752
It's a total mess in there.

347
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,672
- Uh, a mess? Uh, where?
- Mmm-hmm.

348
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,781
- Jesus tits.
- It's not that bad, is it?

349
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:44,743
Is it possible for an entire forest
to do the walk of shame?

350
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:48,872
Seriously, nature is not
supposed to be this sticky.

351
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,244
Uh-oh.

352
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,415
You think she's
who we're looking for?

353
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:57,380
- Whoa, whoa! Wait, wait! Don't!
- Why not?

354
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,553
Because you have
something to live for?

355
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,848
I'm a Maenad.
The god that I'm here to serve is dead.

356
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,513
I literally have
nothing to live for.

357
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:08,812
But thanks, thanks for the less
than basic understanding

358
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,396
of my life's purpose.

359
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:13,692
No, no, no! Wait! Don't, please.
We need your help.

360
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,069
Shoshana.

361
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,772
Shoshana.
We need your help, Shoshana.

362
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,782
Hmm?

363
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,948
Peach Schnapps.

364
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,832
Bacchus left that
for the talking bears to find.

365
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:31,626
Okay, so how
about a toast?

366
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,704
Right? Ba... Bacchus would've
wanted us to drink.

367
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:36,005
God, like, so much. Yeah.

368
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,254
Okay, so to Bacchus.

369
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,220
To Bacchus.

370
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:46,217
- Oh, God, it smells like pee sangria.
- I don't give a shit. Drink it.

371
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,178
- To, uh, Bacchus!
- Bacchus.

372
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,682
Whoo!

373
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,271
Oh, that's good shit.

374
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:03,196
Um, I was a goddess
and I gave away my power,

375
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:07,245
and now I can't use magic.
Only I'm indestructible.

376
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:11,416
So maybe you can help me
understand what is going on.

377
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,127
You were a goddess?

378
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:16,713
Yeah.

379
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:20,876
If all these other Maenads

380
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,428
hadn't run through the poison
wine like a bunch of bitches,

381
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:25,722
I wouldn't even
be in this situation!

382
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:28,551
Well, maybe if you help us,
we can...

383
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,150
Oh...

384
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:43,736
I'm sorry. What are you... What are you doing?

385
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,567
I'm trying to read your aura.

386
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,119
Maybe we can just
get the pine cone out of my face?

387
00:20:57,548 --> 00:21:00,416
- Okay.
- That's what I thought.

388
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,171
Inconclusive.

389
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,720
I do know a ritual that could
help diagnose you further.

390
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,590
But, um, it's pretty intimate.

391
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,972
Um, okay.
I can live with that.

392
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,475
Yeah, the only thing is
I... I can't perform it.

393
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,773
Uh, why not?

394
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,225
Well, I don't believe in you.

395
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,651
I can help interpret,

396
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:22,775
but you need someone
who believes in you,

397
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,233
okay, who worships you,

398
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:28,114
body and soul,

399
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:30,696
to perform the ritual.

400
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,244
Anyone come to mind?

401
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:42,750
Fine, I'll help.

402
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,969
Jesus R.R. Christ.

403
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,177
An innocent girl is a murderer

404
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,554
'cause I couldn't
get to her in time.

405
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,809
Oh, put your tit back
in your training bra, wolf boy.

406
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,849
We don't really know
how innocent this girl was.

407
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:00,184
Sleeping with
her Uber driver

408
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,815
sounds like she had
a death wish to begin with.

409
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:04,646
- You're not helping.
- Drink.

410
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,447
- Is this a potion?
- It's alcohol.

411
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:08,116
Good enough.

412
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:10,364
While you were busy with
your domestic issues,

413
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:13,117
I managed to translate
this Indonesian ritual,

414
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:15,449
and good news is
this is first-year Brakebills

415
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:17,535
multi-culti elective crap.

416
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:20,211
So we can definitely pull it off
without breaking the magic bank.

417
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:24,917
Only prob is finding
one exotic ingredient.

418
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:29,797
Uh, what type of exotic
are we talking about here?

419
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:33,641
We need a living Komodo dragon
so we can cut out its heart,

420
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,686
and I heard a rumor Kanye keeps one
in his New York apartment.

421
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,310
- That sounds on-brand.
- Let's go.

422
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,902
Uh, wait. I have to
give you something.

423
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:48,281
It's loaded
with silver bullets.

424
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:52,361
The Quickening has started
to do weird things to me and...

425
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,822
Well, if I wolf-out,

426
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,372
you might need to stop me.

427
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,082
It's not gonna come to that.

428
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:04,464
I promise.

429
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:09,135
Now come on.
Let's go steal Kanye's lizard.

430
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:41,418
As you can see,
rather hard to get in unseen.

431
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,460
Not if you can bend light.

432
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:46,130
Regardless, stealing
the books isn't really

433
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,582
the biggest issue,
is it?

434
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:50,732
If the Library discovers they're gone,
they're gonna come after you.

435
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,073
Yeah, but if they
read my book,

436
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,713
they'll know exactly
where I'll be.

437
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:57,600
Yes, but what if
they read your book

438
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,803
and still had no idea
where you were?

439
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,393
What are you proposing?

440
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:08,149
When I was writing <i>The Wandering Dune,</i>
I was also studying magic.

441
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,396
Now, I kept
blowing deadlines

442
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:13,700
until I found a spell
for automatic writing.

443
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:17,746
Now, you feed it a premise
and it constructs an airtight storyline.

444
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:20,323
I gather they use it in
Hollywood all the time.

445
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,541
That explains Netflix.

446
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:25,332
How does this spell work?

447
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,255
Why, we steal the manuscripts,
pull the endings,

448
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:29,986
cast a spell on them,
and then replace them

449
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,297
just before they take them away
to bind them as books.

450
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:34,300
<i>Voilà</i>. Oh, you'll be
very surprised

451
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,847
how your stories turn out.

452
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,094
Let me guess.

453
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:39,904
You'll show me how to do the spell
if I help you with the <i>World Book?</i>

454
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:42,016
Well, that only
seems fair, doesn't it?

455
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:46,851
Look, do you want
my help or not?

456
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,619
Mom, I told you I'd have this
done by tomorrow, so just...

457
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:00,538
Jesus.

458
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:02,703
Hello?

459
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:05,710
I found these in your
dead father's fridge.

460
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:09,248
They're not quite what
I'd hoped they'd be.

461
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,590
You finished
with the killing yet?

462
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:13,043
With the, uh...

463
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:14,137
What?

464
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:17,714
Your father's dead. I thought, perhaps,
you'd get angry and kill things.

465
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:18,808
That's what I'd do.

466
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:21,434
It's not really
what people do.

467
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:23,603
Nowadays, anyway.

468
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:26,727
You're not going
to kill anything?

469
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:28,392
Interesting.

470
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:32,980
Frozen peas?

471
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,780
Nope. No, thanks.

472
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:38,155
Let's go, then.

473
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,827
I'm bored of this food.

474
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:42,496
Can I just have
a few minutes to finish this?

475
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,581
This is important to you?

476
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,502
Yeah, it is.

477
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,258
This is a very
interesting game,

478
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:57,007
the loving
your dead dad game.

479
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,349
I don't understand it.

480
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,476
It's not a game. It...

481
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:08,727
There must be someone
who's important to you,

482
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:10,854
who you... Who you miss.

483
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,398
I don't remember.

484
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:15,446
But perhaps you're right.

485
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,444
I could learn
something from this.

486
00:26:19,203 --> 00:26:20,694
I'll let you play
this game.

487
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:25,415
I will sit still,
and I won't kill anything

488
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:27,117
and I'll watch you
while you...

489
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:29,419
You think about
your dead father?

490
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:31,041
Is that what
you're doing?

491
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,131
Yeah. Kind of.

492
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:38,590
This is the weirdest thing
I've ever done.

493
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,013
But maybe it'll be fun.

494
00:26:56,115 --> 00:27:01,986
I... She wasn't lying.
This is pretty intimate.

495
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:03,778
Yeah, well,

496
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,660
you're not the one who has to strip naked
and be anointed with oil.

497
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,707
Are you sure
you want to do this?

498
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,465
I don't really see
another way, do you?

499
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,796
Wait. Um...

500
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:21,546
Maybe there is
another way? Uh...

501
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,390
Something a little
less painful?

502
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,555
- Painful?
- Not painful. Um...

503
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,475
You know
I'm not broken, right?

504
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,518
I'm not some flower
or a delicate piece of glass.

505
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:40,149
I'm a person,
and people heal.

506
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:44,402
Yeah, look, I... I'm just not
very comfortable with the way

507
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:45,598
this is going down, you know?

508
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,182
Yeah, well, this isn't
really about you.

509
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,412
So maybe you could
just get over yourself.

510
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,206
I'm trying.

511
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,089
It's nothing you
haven't seen before.

512
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,384
Ta-da.

513
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:11,138
I guess I should start.

514
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,435
- I guess you should.
- Yeah.

515
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:42,256
<i>I do what I want
Don't do what I'm told</i>

516
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,887
<i>What I'm told</i>

517
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,428
<i>Been riding on the edge</i>

518
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:51,010
<i>With your heart in
a chokehold</i>

519
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:53,312
<i>Heart in a chokehold</i>

520
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,812
<i>Maybe I'm a lost cause</i>

521
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:58,435
I...

522
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,686
What's wrong?

523
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,362
I, uh...

524
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:04,316
I got to go up front.

525
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:06,739
<i>Won't do what I'm told</i>

526
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:09,161
Are you asking
if you can touch my boobs?

527
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:13,162
I am asking you
if I can touch your boobs.

528
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,910
You can touch my boobs.

529
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,421
Just don't break them.

530
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:18,747
Ha-ha.

531
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:26,470
<i>You should know You should know
You should know</i>

532
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:27,797
<i>Oh</i>

533
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:28,933
What?

534
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,553
No, it's just... It's cold.

535
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:33,887
Oh, I'm sorry.
I can warm it up.

536
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:37,270
<i>I don't know how
to give you my love, babe</i>

537
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,397
<i>'Cause I'm too good
at messing it up</i>

538
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:44,777
<i>Maybe I could change</i>

539
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:48,359
<i>By now you should know
everything is strange</i>

540
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,661
It's weird for me,
too, you know.

541
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:58,586
<i>Give you my love</i>

542
00:29:58,672 --> 00:30:01,710
<i>I don't know how
to give you my love</i>

543
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,088
You ready
to wash my feet?

544
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,686
- Now what?
- Scream!

545
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:23,815
Now eat it!
Uh...

546
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,486
It's not bad, actually.

547
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:37,249
I told you, vulnerable is
not technically endangered.

548
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:38,396
I think I'm going
to be sick.

549
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,127
Don't you dare throw up
that lizard heart.

550
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:41,316
We killed
a vulnerable creature

551
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,376
to save your ass.

552
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:44,082
It better not
be for nothing.

553
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:47,044
Not to mention that is not the way
I thought I'd meet Kanye.

554
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:48,594
It's actually
less messed up

555
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,887
than the way
I thought it'd be.

556
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:50,973
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

557
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:54,266
<i>You want me, Josh?</i>

558
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,894
<i>You know what
would be hot right now?</i>

559
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:04,022
<i>If you just took me
right here in this car.</i>

560
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:06,983
- Stop the car!
- What is it?

561
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:08,781
Pull the car over
right fucking now!

562
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:11,994
No, no!

563
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:48,317
Son of a clit!

564
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:49,648
The ritual didn't work.

565
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,074
Oh, is that why you screamed
and ran out of the car?

566
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,696
Just let me in, okay?

567
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:55,904
Why? So you can
wolf-hump me to death?

568
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:59,866
No, I wanted to do things,
but you're safe now, okay?

569
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,076
- It passed.
- How?

570
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:04,792
I kind of turned
a tree into a werewolf,

571
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,372
if you know
what I'm saying.

572
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:07,466
Oh, got it.

573
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:09,921
It's not a permanent solution.

574
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,593
But it's enough
to keep the urges off

575
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,421
until we get to
where we're going.

576
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,381
You mind telling me
where that is, maple dick?

577
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,141
Brakebills.

578
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:22,100
I thought this
would be interesting.

579
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:23,605
It's not.

580
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,607
I'm almost done. Just...

581
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,946
A little while longer
and then we can go.

582
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:35,075
- Why did you do that?
- Slightly more interesting.

583
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:36,198
No.

584
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:38,158
Stop it!

585
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:42,542
I don't understand.
Your father is dead, right?

586
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,869
So these belong
to you now, do they not?

587
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,044
Yes, they belong to me.

588
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,164
What is your point?

589
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:49,920
Why are you
doing any of this?

590
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:53,219
Because I told my mom
I would, okay?

591
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:58,300
Jesus Christ, I can't believe
I'm having to explain this.

592
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:02,262
Why does your mother have such
strange power over you?

593
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:06,273
Because once,
when I was a kid,

594
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,975
I broke an ashtray.

595
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,527
And now
she still fucking thinks

596
00:33:10,614 --> 00:33:11,614
that I break everything.

597
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:13,866
Because...

598
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:18,115
Basically, your parents never
change how they see you.

599
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:19,205
No matter what.

600
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,414
So if they can't
change how they see you,

601
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:25,039
then why does it matter?

602
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:29,163
Because sometimes
I think she's right.

603
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,916
Things break around me.

604
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:36,175
Alice, my dad,

605
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,597
all of goddamn magic.

606
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,758
Then break them
on purpose.

607
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:42,889
They're your planes.

608
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,853
You can do what
you want with them.

609
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,314
Maybe you'll feel better.

610
00:34:52,841 --> 00:34:54,082
I don't mean to be rude,

611
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:57,839
but here I am helping as promised
without an assurance you'll do the same.

612
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,136
Jesus, you're relentless.

613
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,464
Okay, fine.
I'll help you with your spell.

614
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,140
Yet you seem
to hate yourself for it.

615
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:06,018
I mean, you can
understand my worry.

616
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,471
I don't have to be
happy about it.

617
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:09,565
A word of advice.

618
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:12,358
If you want to survive,
stop torturing yourself.

619
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:14,857
Maybe you could do with
a little more self-hatred.

620
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,233
And fewer Mr. Rogers vests.

621
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:20,991
You think that what you've done
and who you are, are the same thing.

622
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:23,486
When they don't match up,
you hate yourself.

623
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,912
Alice, they'll never match up.

624
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:27,490
You don't know
anything about me.

625
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:29,437
I know what it feels like
to be unable to change

626
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:30,918
no matter how much
I want to.

627
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:35,252
Children don't care
if you contradict yourself, you know?

628
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,404
Perhaps that's
a bad example coming from me,

629
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:39,548
but I'm just trying to help.

630
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:44,473
Please just stop doing...

631
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:51,931
What is it?

632
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:53,687
The end of Quentin's book.

633
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:56,064
He's going to die.

634
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:58,938
Isn't that how
all books end?

635
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,366
His ends next week.

636
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:08,160
And as requested,

637
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,990
the water my feet
were bathed in.

638
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,537
That's pretty murky.

639
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,251
Okay, judgey.

640
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,881
What's it mean?

641
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,670
It's too early to say.

642
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,045
This is very interesting,
though.

643
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:25,215
I thought you said
you didn't have any power.

644
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:29,261
- No. I don't. I... I can't do magic.
- Those aren't the same.

645
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:31,804
Oh, this,

646
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:35,228
this is real weird.

647
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:39,896
You weren't bullshitting me

648
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:41,855
when you said you were
a goddess, were you?

649
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:46,536
No, but how... How can I be a goddess
if I don't have any power?

650
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,954
Maybe you think
you don't, but...

651
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:54,039
I have never seen anything
like this before.

652
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,667
So we're good now?

653
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:00,500
You're not gonna
kill yourself?

654
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,129
No, I can't now.

655
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,132
I have a new deity to follow.

656
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:08,392
Oh, boy.

657
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,226
I think
you're overreacting.

658
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,820
I could've sexually assaulted
you or ate you.

659
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,551
I don't honestly know how
things would've turned out.

660
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,817
It's no reason to give up.
There's got to be a solution.

661
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,618
I've got, what, a couple hours
before The Quickening takes over,

662
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:31,038
and I'm sorry if that makes me
a wimp or whatever,

663
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:32,865
but I don't want to rape
or murder anyone.

664
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,040
Oh, come on.

665
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:36,919
There are plenty of people
who deserve to be killed.

666
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:39,664
I can think of a half dozen
at Brakebills alone.

667
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,318
If you can just keep
your twat together,

668
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:44,176
I'm sure I can get at least
one of them down here.

669
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,128
I mean,
Todd totally owes me.

670
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:49,508
- He doesn't owe you his life.
- Doesn't he?

671
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,103
I can't do it, Margo.

672
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:55,771
Well, you can't do nothing,

673
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:57,519
because you'll die
in this cage.

674
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,020
At least I can live with that.

675
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:01,777
I mean, not live exactly,

676
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:03,445
but you...
You get what I'm saying.

677
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:04,863
This is bullshit.

678
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,865
You're just throwing
your life away.

679
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,593
I was thinking more
like noble sacrifice.

680
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,493
Screw your noble sacrifice!

681
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:14,498
What is it with you boys
and your noble sacrifice?

682
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:15,950
I'm not gonna let you do it.

683
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:17,160
Well, it's not your choice.

684
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,661
You can't fix me, okay?

685
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:19,962
Some things are just broken,

686
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,192
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

687
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:22,832
Said the quitter
right before he quit.

688
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:25,794
You think I want to die?
Of course I fucking don't!

689
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:28,324
But... But I don't see a way out of this,
and frankly you not giving up

690
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:29,708
is making what
I have to do harder.

691
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:36,395
You want to do
something stupid?

692
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:44,232
Fine by me.

693
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,442
What the hell are you doing?

694
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:47,739
Something stupider.

695
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:53,537
This isn't a joke, Margo. I... I'm not
going to be able to control myself.

696
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:55,660
I might kill you or...

697
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,991
- Or...
- Or what?

698
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,627
Fuck me?

699
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,585
Margo.

700
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:08,177
This curse isn't curable.

701
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,212
I don't want you
to go through this.

702
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:11,888
- The... The Quickening is...
- Why not?

703
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:12,975
Because...

704
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,304
I like you.

705
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:17,686
I like you, too.

706
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:23,192
And I'm not gonna lose
another friend today, okay?

707
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,489
I can't make you
kill someone,

708
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,113
but I can consent.

709
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:41,122
Damn.

710
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,249
The Quickening makes you
a really good kisser.

711
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,705
I know.

712
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:54,466
That was more cathartic
than I thought it would be.

713
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:57,222
It was kind of fun,
wasn't it?

714
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:04,892
It feels good after you deal
with death, doesn't it?

715
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:07,235
A little.

716
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:08,563
Still hurts,

717
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,691
but eventually it hurts
a little less.

718
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:12,784
Uh-huh.

719
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:18,580
I'm going to need your help
to search for more gods.

720
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:21,534
You'll be more useful to me
if you feel better,

721
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:26,339
so you should know that
your friend Eliot is dead.

722
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:33,132
You can smash
more things if you want.

723
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:35,635
And then we'll go
get something to eat.

724
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:38,225
Sound good?

725
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,730
I cannot believe
you just did that.

726
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:50,905
I rocked your world.
Get over it.

727
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,529
Oh, no, you...
That was great.

728
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:58,078
It's just you can't
have sex now with anyone

729
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:01,953
who isn't L-positive
without infecting them.

730
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,784
You know, so...

731
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:06,499
Since when is
P-in-the-V sex

732
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:09,457
the pinnacle of what one
or two or three or five

733
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,337
or an animal can do together?

734
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:14,174
I mean, it's not even
on my top 10.

735
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:17,715
I guess I see
your point there.

736
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,224
All the same,

737
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,018
what are you gonna do
about The Quickening?

738
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:23,687
How... How are you
gonna handle that?

739
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:25,890
In what, 30 years?

740
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,475
No way I'm gonna
live that long.

741
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,355
And if I do,
Todd totally owes me.

742
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,319
You're joking, right?

743
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:32,980
You're joking.

744
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,824
So what is this? This is...

745
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,031
This is
just casual, right?

746
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:44,833
We're not...
You know?

747
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:48,246
I saved your
fucking life, bitch.

748
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:51,749
Casual that.

749
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:55,503
Thanks, Margo.

750
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,216
I'm sorry we couldn't

751
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:02,141
figure out a way to help,

752
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,514
you know...

753
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:07,769
I am, too.

754
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,936
I would have done
anything to save him.

755
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:19,405
But I think he might
actually be gone.

756
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,495
<i>I felt the moment
his soul died.</i>

757
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,088
It only hurt
for a second.

758
00:42:31,174 --> 00:42:35,384
I promise he didn't suffer.

759
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,926
You'll come around.

760
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,556
I know it.

761
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:50,812
<i>Let's take it right back</i>

762
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,484
<i>Hello?</i>

763
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:57,064
<i>But we never look back</i>

764
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:59,525
<i>No, we only look forward</i>

765
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:03,579
<i>To all the new pain</i>

766
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:06,532
<i>And violence that we blame</i>

767
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:08,367
<i>No, we never look back</i>

768
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,954
<i>No, we only look forward</i>

769
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,542
Hello?

770
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:14,919
<i>With all our fate</i>

771
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:18,298
<i>Hearts broken from the start</i>

772
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,346
Is anybody there?

773
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:24,178
Margo!

774
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:28,308
<i>Only to be held tall</i>

775
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:31,390
<i>By the writing on the wall</i>

776
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:35,478
<i>We don't need
no premonitions, no</i>

777
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:43,990
<i>Let's take it right back</i>

778
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,948
<i>To where it all began</i>

779
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:50,000
<i>But we never look back</i>

780
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:52,328
<i>No, we only look forward</i>

781
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:55,960
<i>To all the new shame</i>

782
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,588
<i>And waste of what we gain</i>
