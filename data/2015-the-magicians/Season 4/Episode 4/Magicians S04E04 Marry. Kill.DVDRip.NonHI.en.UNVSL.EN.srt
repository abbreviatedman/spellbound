00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,697
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,933
They're filling in the
endings of our books.

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,519
I'm sorry about your
friend's books, but...

4
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:11,637
Just go while you
still have the chance.

5
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:16,380
Technically, I have sexually
transmitted lycanthropy.

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,351
The other Josh told
me something terrible

7
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:19,750
was going to happen to him.

8
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,964
It was called "The Quickening."

9
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:22,268
It's going to happen to me, too.

10
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:23,950
I'm... A full-on goddess.

11
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:27,658
I'm not connected
to anything anymore.

12
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:30,630
My dad and I used to
build model airplanes.

13
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:34,031
You got your hands on this,
and it ended up in 20 pieces.

14
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:36,798
Magic's gone. I went into
remission a week later.

15
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,169
You turned your back on
what happens to your dad.

16
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:41,606
It's a voicemail from my mom.

17
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:43,541
Will you sit here for a minute?

18
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:44,844
Yeah.

19
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:48,238
I know Bacchus. He's a friend.

20
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:49,374
Then you'll poison him.

21
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:52,009
You know what's incredible?
How you can be such a good friend

22
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:54,247
and such a terrible friend
at the exact same time.

23
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:56,654
Gods are so tricky.

24
00:00:56,723 --> 00:01:01,218
<i>They took this part of
me that knew things.</i>

25
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:06,843
How long has he been there?

26
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:09,564
Since we got back from Fillory.

27
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:12,632
He brought you back? I
was as surprised as you.

28
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:20,344
Meanwhile, you are
baking. Condolence muffins.

29
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,542
For Quentin?

30
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,482
His dad just passed away.

31
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:27,715
And a bullshit yuppie pastry
is gonna help him with that?

32
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:29,780
A muffin is not a
pastry. It's a quickbread.

33
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,623
What the hell is wrong with you?

34
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:35,686
I had to help The Monster murder a
friend of mine, and I'm not happy about it.

35
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:39,059
From the looks
of it, neither is he.

36
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:40,376
Well, I don't get
why he's depressed.

37
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,400
He got what he wanted.

38
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:44,032
Where's Darth Eliot?

39
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:51,741
She's gonna get us all killed.

40
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:03,853
I have examined this
over and over again,

41
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:06,223
and it still won't
reveal itself to me.

42
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,558
Why can't I remember anything?

43
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:11,121
I don't know. Total
drag, I get you.

44
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:13,758
But that's kind of what goes
along with a human body.

45
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:16,770
Aches, pains,
can't remember shit.

46
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:19,898
And since you're done with
your whole deal, I was thinking...

47
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,135
What deal are you talking about?

48
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,578
We led you to Bacchus.

49
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,705
You killed him.

50
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,411
So now that we're done-sies...
Don't speak to me of done-sies.

51
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,249
Only Bacchus is done-sies.

52
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,552
I'm just saying, you
got your vengeance.

53
00:02:36,623 --> 00:02:38,285
Might wanna try another body.

54
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:41,794
Maybe a non-human one.

55
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:43,319
I don't know.

56
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,800
See if it helps with the
whole remembering thing.

57
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,259
I'm good.

58
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,803
Fuck.

59
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:04,542
You look like you could
use a big ball of carbs.

60
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:13,684
Jesus tits, this is a
good ball of carbs.

61
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,258
I thought you were pissed at me.

62
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:19,458
Oh, I'm not gonna pretend
I'm happy about Bacchus,

63
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:23,698
but I'm still sorry about Eliot.

64
00:03:37,851 --> 00:03:41,219
Josh? Are you okay?

65
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:57,570
Oh.

66
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:59,004
Oh...

67
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:31,794
You want me to come?

68
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:34,034
I'm gonna miss the funeral.

69
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:36,042
I missed everything
leading up to it.

70
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,546
There's nothing you can say
to my mom that'll change that.

71
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:42,014
Well, I could say
that it's not your fault.

72
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:45,450
The way she sees
it, she's the grown-up

73
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,251
and I'm still making the
same kid mistakes I always did.

74
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,621
You break things.
I break things.

75
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:54,354
Parents are the worst.

76
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:57,492
What about you?

77
00:04:57,564 --> 00:04:59,430
Oh, you know.

78
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,365
I was gonna look through
all the stolen books

79
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:03,062
Marina has stashed around.

80
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,037
See if I could find out
why I'm indestructible

81
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:06,869
yet can't do magic.

82
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,207
What about Penny? He
still, uh, sweating you?

83
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:13,543
He's not sweating me. Oh, right.

84
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,878
He's just following you around
with that "I'm totally into you,

85
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,494
"but I'm not gonna say
anything about it" vibe.

86
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:21,010
Quentin. What? I'm just saying.

87
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:24,956
Maybe he could help
you with the research.

88
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,425
You're a dick.

89
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,086
I am a dick.

90
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:45,609
Hey, uh... Penny
23. Look at that.

91
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,238
That sounded real natural.

92
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:49,112
Why are you skittish as fuck?

93
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,445
Am I? That's... No.

94
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:51,576
What's in the bag?

95
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,313
Oh, nothing.

96
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:55,415
You got blood on
your face. What?

97
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:56,956
Yeah, look in the mirror.

98
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,821
Oh, no, no, no, no, don't.

99
00:05:58,892 --> 00:05:59,969
It's not what it looks like.

100
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:02,656
Oh! It looks like a dead animal.

101
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:05,494
Okay, maybe it is
what it looks like.

102
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,844
Is this 'cause of The
Quickening? I don't know.

103
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,133
Well, it's something. Look,
I don't know what to do.

104
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,215
Well, I was pretty damn
clear about one thing, wasn't I?

105
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:13,482
- You stay away from...
- Hey, guys.

106
00:06:13,506 --> 00:06:15,475
Julia. Hey.

107
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,171
Hey, did Marina stash
any books in here?

108
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:19,805
What? Uh... Books? No, I...

109
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,290
I think in the... Yeah.
The other room?

110
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,215
Yeah, just not in the
subject I'm looking for.

111
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,147
About god problems.

112
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:28,780
You know, like, where did they
go for magical medical advice?

113
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:31,882
Why don't I help
you look, you know?

114
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:34,359
Uh, what about the
Maenads? The... The Maenads?

115
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,896
The followers of Bacchus'.

116
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:39,831
They're kind of high
priestess/nurses of the gods.

117
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,698
They were always
at Bacchus' parties

118
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:44,932
and when he would get too
wrecked, which was always,

119
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:47,734
they pulled him out and
gave him a divine B12 shot or...

120
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:51,402
Wait, wait, so The Monster killed
Bacchus but didn't touch the Maenads?

121
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:54,013
They're probably
still in Fillory.

122
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,124
They were pretty
attached to him.

123
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,344
Oh, I... I can take you.

124
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,353
Yeah, that'd be great.
Um, thanks, Josh.

125
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:02,251
Yeah.

126
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:04,791
You get this Quickening
bullshit figured out right now.

127
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:07,418
Okay.

128
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:15,566
I didn't think I passed it
on. You never said anything.

129
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:19,697
Oh, I'm sorry. Were you
waiting for me to tell you?

130
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:20,883
You never disclosed your status

131
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,500
to me in the first place.

132
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:23,634
Because you were

133
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,942
so understanding,
I thought you knew.

134
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,348
Uh, it was a little bit of a
low point for me, that night.

135
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,484
Oh, well, great to hear.

136
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,953
I don't mean you.

137
00:07:35,088 --> 00:07:36,989
I was going through
a bad divorce.

138
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,457
You're the first person

139
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:41,017
who really seemed to get
what I was going through.

140
00:07:41,227 --> 00:07:44,720
Fine, whatever. Look...
Look, I just need your help.

141
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:48,767
What is going on with me?
With us? The Quickening?

142
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:51,134
Well, I don't really
know everything.

143
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:55,668
You're a goddamn cryptozoology
professor. What do you know?

144
00:07:55,742 --> 00:07:58,177
Lycanthropy is
technically a curse.

145
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,637
Transformations are
tied to the lunar cycle

146
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:05,843
and behavioral changes
are mostly non-lethal,

147
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,581
except during The Quickening.

148
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:10,351
Well, that sounds
pretty, pretty bad.

149
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:12,949
Oh, luckily, it only happens
every 30 years or so.

150
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:17,623
In the 48 hours leading up, all
lycanthropes experience urges

151
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:21,259
starting in the form of
nightmares or even waking dreams.

152
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,633
What is the curse
trying to make me do?

153
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:27,196
Have traditional sex
with an uninfected person

154
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,902
or kill them. Jesus K. LeChrist.

155
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:35,176
The urges increase as the
moon moves towards its aphelion.

156
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:38,184
The climax, as it were, and
the lycanthropic high point

157
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:41,050
of lupinity or wolf-ness.

158
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:44,614
I took your class, Helen. I
know what lupinity means.

159
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:48,456
Why can't I just lock
myself up in a cage

160
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,053
until The Quickening passes?

161
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,725
Because that won't
satisfy the urge.

162
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,792
You need to have sex or kill
or you'll rip your own guts out.

163
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,236
That's how the curse
is ensured to spread.

164
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,499
It's quite clever, actually.

165
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:00,767
Oh, yeah, real clever

166
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:02,151
how I'm going to rape
or murder someone

167
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:03,666
in the next two
days, no matter what.

168
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,611
If you try to suppress it, it's
always possible you'll do both

169
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,341
or commit suicide.

170
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:11,044
Just, you know, to have
all the options on the table.

171
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:13,016
What the hell am I going to do?

172
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,486
What... What are we going to do?

173
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:18,321
Have you considered
Tinder? What? No.

174
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,259
Because I have a
really, really bad STD

175
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:24,126
and that sort of kills the
desire to sleep with anyone.

176
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:25,995
So forget... Mmm-hmm.

177
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,295
Wait.

178
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,268
Did you do that?

179
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,532
Yes. And it worked.

180
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:35,734
That is why I am not
going crazy right now. Huh.

181
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,735
Oh, you are very charming, Josh.

182
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:42,042
I'm sure you'll have no
trouble finding someone

183
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:43,640
to dance with before, you know,

184
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:45,708
the wolf makes a choice for you.

185
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,046
Good luck, Josh.

186
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:55,794
The Librarians don't
know I've been living here.

187
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:58,457
Apologies for the mess.

188
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:02,427
Oh, and, uh, for how
I brought you here.

189
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:04,198
I didn't mean to be rough.

190
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,934
I just wanted to get you out
of sight before you got caught.

191
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,176
You do remember me,
don't you? I'm Christopher...

192
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:12,473
Plover.

193
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:15,873
You're the child molester
who's directly responsible

194
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,974
for Martin Chatwin
becoming The Beast.

195
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:22,521
I also wrote some
very popular books.

196
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,283
How did you end up here anyway?

197
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,917
Oh, that's a long
and boring story.

198
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:30,720
The important thing is
we can help each other.

199
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,129
See, I need an extra
pair of hands. No.

200
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:38,631
And yet I know very well
that you could use my help.

201
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,504
You're trying to escape
The Order, aren't you?

202
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:42,940
From the looks
of it, we both are.

203
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:48,074
You didn't leave with
Santa Claus. Why not?

204
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:52,312
I get sleigh-sick. You
can say what you want.

205
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:55,616
But I know the real reason... Oh,
please don't touch that. Please.

206
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:58,248
The real reason
you stayed behind.

207
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:03,260
You were looking for your
book, yours and your friends'.

208
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,795
Do you have them?

209
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,766
The books are in
the Revision Room.

210
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:11,430
But I happen to
know where that is.

211
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:15,839
So you help me with my little
something, and I'll take you there.

212
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:17,207
Deal?

213
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:25,617
I don't know why your
father made so many of them.

214
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,745
He liked planes.

215
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,852
A creative outlet.

216
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:35,889
He's dead, Mom. We
can stop criticizing him.

217
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:39,399
I didn't want to be here at all, you
know, but there was no one else.

218
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:41,662
Molly is furious.

219
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,396
You know how she felt about Ted.

220
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:46,169
I know, I'm sorry, I...

221
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,337
I was traveling and
my phone died and I...

222
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:53,309
You're the only
millennial I know

223
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,177
who isn't buried
in his phone 24/7.

224
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:56,944
Are we going to do this again?

225
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,415
What was wrong with him, huh?

226
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,551
People make
friends. That's normal.

227
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:12,227
He was normal. I divorced
him, he was so normal,

228
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,198
so where are his
goddamn friends?

229
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,537
There was no one at the funeral.

230
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,435
I don't know.

231
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:22,000
Did he ever date?

232
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,703
Never mind. I
don't want to know.

233
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,475
Okay, so we pack these boxes.

234
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,110
Yeah, unless you want
to keep all this junk.

235
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:35,130
I found a guy upstate. He'll
take them off your hands,

236
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,589
but you have to get
it done by tomorrow.

237
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:44,858
I... I got it. Okay,
just, um, be careful.

238
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,062
Don't break anything.

239
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:53,868
Christ on a goddamn
communion wafer.

240
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,104
It's like I'm caught in a
real-life game of marry-fuck-kill,

241
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:58,838
only "marry" is off the table.

242
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:03,007
What are you gonna do about
it? I have no goddamn clue.

243
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,027
Why do you think I'm sitting
here with my head in my hands,

244
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:07,418
the traditional Hoberman
despair position?

245
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:10,286
Okay, then here's a plan.

246
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,286
We're going to
fix this bullshit.

247
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,418
I don't want to add to
your problems, Margo.

248
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,054
So 'cause of that,
you're gonna sit back

249
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,892
and just let this
shit happen to you?

250
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:19,392
Huh?

251
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,525
This ain't prom night,

252
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:23,769
and the only thing
I know for sure

253
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:26,635
is you're not going to fix
anything if you nutsack out on me.

254
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:29,266
I won't nutsack out.

255
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:31,573
Good. That's
what I want to hear.

256
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:35,006
Because we are going to
find a way out of this thing,

257
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:37,609
or we're gonna die trying.

258
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:48,070
I'm starting to see why no one's
ever beaten this curse. It's like herpes.

259
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:51,258
Cockroach-in-a-nuclear-war-level
impossible to stomp out.

260
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:55,291
Well, I found some shit on a
ritual from an Indonesian tribe.

261
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:58,667
It's supposed to prevent
supernatural transformations.

262
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:02,005
Or maybe cause them.
My Indonesian sucks.

263
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:05,912
Uber alert.

264
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:09,039
You know, these surge
prices are really getting out of...

265
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:12,108
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

266
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,019
Okay, surge prices piss me
off, too, but are you all right?

267
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:18,124
I've always been upfront
about my L-positive status

268
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,559
with any potential partners
before anything happens.

269
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:24,654
What's that have to do
with Uber? Isaac wasn't.

270
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,423
Oh.

271
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:29,128
So how many people
did Isaac do doggy-style?

272
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,570
Just one, and I'm going
to go warn her now.

273
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,331
Uh-huh. Yup! What a Monday!

274
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,739
So this book is used
to help me locate

275
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,645
different worlds via
a cooperative spell?

276
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,707
It is called <i>The World Book.</i>

277
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:48,084
Yes, I can read. So it's
like the encyclopedia.

278
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:51,283
More like an atlas. What
world are you looking for?

279
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:54,919
One where I can be
happy, where I can belong.

280
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:59,823
No, it's not what you think.
I'm not interested in that.

281
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,391
I just want to go somewhere
where I can do no harm.

282
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,061
I'll never do that again.
I swear on my life.

283
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,573
Yeah, well, I don't
know if I believe you.

284
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,109
I spent years being
tortured by Martin,

285
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,037
plenty of time to
think on my actions

286
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,439
and regret them.

287
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:21,747
Did you never unintentionally
hurt someone you love, Alice?

288
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,690
I never molested a child.

289
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:28,795
But, yes, I've
done things I regret.

290
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:31,729
Don't you deserve happiness? No.

291
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:35,665
Oh, come on, don't be so hard
on yourself. We all deserve it.

292
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:37,636
I don't think you do.

293
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:40,897
I don't particularly
care what you think.

294
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:42,873
You need my help
finding the Revision Room.

295
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,570
So either you help
me with this spell,

296
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:46,442
or you're on your own.

297
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,714
Who are you? Hi, uh, I'm Josh.

298
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,377
I'm Isaac's friend.

299
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:55,685
Isaac.

300
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:58,384
He hooked up with
you that one time.

301
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,482
Oh.

302
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,626
Right.

303
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:05,260
Look, it's a really
bad time right now.

304
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:07,643
Oh, uh, no, Isaac really wanted
me to talk to you about something,

305
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:11,297
and it's kind of an emergency.
So can I come in, please?

306
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,905
How do you know Isaac again?

307
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,566
Oh, uh...

308
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,907
He and I met at Jewish camp.

309
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:22,108
This is kind of weird. I mean,
why did he send a friend

310
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:23,492
instead of, like,
calling me himself?

311
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:27,817
He's got, uh, laryngitis.
So he can't text?

312
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:30,617
And he broke all of his fingers.

313
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:35,119
Anyhoo, I've got to talk to
you about Isaac's problem,

314
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:39,529
which he's embarrassed because
he came down with something,

315
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,499
and he's afraid that you
might have caught it from him.

316
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:46,299
Caught what? Oh, just a

317
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:48,135
herpes-like thing.

318
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:51,301
He gave me herpes? I
believe I said "herpes-like."

319
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,844
Well, what the hell is it?

320
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:54,456
The only way to know
if you got it is to sort of

321
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,658
go through the symptoms and see
if you've been experiencing them.

322
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,413
Okay, Josh from Jewish camp,

323
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:01,579
I'm going to
discuss genital warts

324
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:05,022
and discharge with
you 'cause we just met.

325
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:07,893
Jesus Christ. Fuck my life!

326
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,727
Look, have you maybe not
been feeling yourself lately?

327
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:14,528
Not really. And I'm
beginning to wonder

328
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,040
why I let you in,
in the first place.

329
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:19,561
Great, and, uh, have you
maybe been having dreams

330
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:21,904
that are weird and violent?

331
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,233
Maybe.

332
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,803
Right, well, this last one
might sound a little crazy,

333
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,841
but have you maybe been unable
to control yourself around guys?

334
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,686
Get out of my apartment.

335
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:36,098
Oh, wait. No, no,
no. This wasn't me

336
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:37,499
trying to freak you
out. Seriously, get out!

337
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:42,359
Okay, please, just let me
help you. I just want to help.

338
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,723
It's been a really
hard couple of days.

339
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:52,097
I've been totally
freaking, like...

340
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,666
What's wrong with me?
I know what you mean,

341
00:17:56,742 --> 00:18:00,338
and it's completely normal,

342
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,815
and I assure you,
this is not your fault.

343
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:08,446
That's so good to hear. I mean,

344
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:13,186
how could I even do
that to someone else?

345
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,752
It's a total mess in there.

346
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,694
Uh, a mess? Uh, where? Mmm-hmm.

347
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:36,772
Jesus tits. It's
not that bad, is it?

348
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:44,754
Is it possible for an entire
forest to do the walk of shame?

349
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:48,886
Seriously, nature is not
supposed to be this sticky.

350
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:51,263
Uh-oh.

351
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:54,432
You think she's who
we're looking for?

352
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,397
Whoa, whoa! Wait,
wait! Don't! Why not?

353
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,564
Because you have
something to live for?

354
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,837
I'm a Maenad. The god
that I'm here to serve is dead.

355
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,535
I literally have
nothing to live for.

356
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:08,809
But thanks, thanks for the
less than basic understanding

357
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:10,416
of my life's purpose.

358
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:13,681
No, no, no! Wait! Don't,
please. We need your help.

359
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:16,083
Shoshana.

360
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,784
Shoshana. We need
your help, Shoshana.

361
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:21,786
Hmm?

362
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:23,956
Peach Schnapps.

363
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,866
Bacchus left that for
the talking bears to find.

364
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:31,631
Okay, so how about a toast?

365
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,696
Right? Ba... Bacchus
would've wanted us to drink.

366
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,032
God, like, so much. Yeah.

367
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,236
Okay, so to Bacchus.

368
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,276
To Bacchus.

369
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:46,251
Oh, God, it smells like pee
sangria. I don't give a shit. Drink it.

370
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:49,186
To, uh, Bacchus! Bacchus.

371
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:50,689
Whoo!

372
00:19:56,896 --> 00:19:59,297
Oh, that's good shit.

373
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:03,201
Um, I was a goddess
and I gave away my power,

374
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:07,263
and now I can't use magic.
Only I'm indestructible.

375
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:11,401
So maybe you can help me
understand what is going on.

376
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,141
You were a goddess?

377
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:16,713
Yeah.

378
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:20,915
If all these other Maenads

379
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:23,455
hadn't run through the poison
wine like a bunch of bitches,

380
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,753
I wouldn't even
be in this situation!

381
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:28,556
Well, maybe if you
help us, we can...

382
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,161
Oh...

383
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:43,742
I'm sorry. What are
you... What are you doing?

384
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,573
I'm trying to read your aura.

385
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,108
Maybe we can just get the
pine cone out of my face?

386
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:00,424
Okay. That's what I thought.

387
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:02,189
Inconclusive.

388
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,720
I do know a ritual that could
help diagnose you further.

389
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,596
But, um, it's pretty intimate.

390
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:12,004
Um, okay. I can live with that.

391
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:14,506
Yeah, the only thing
is I... I can't perform it.

392
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:16,804
Uh, why not?

393
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:18,242
Well, I don't believe in you.

394
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,676
I can help interpret,

395
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:22,772
but you need someone
who believes in you,

396
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,244
okay, who worships you,

397
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:28,116
body and soul,

398
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:30,713
to perform the ritual.

399
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:34,253
Anyone come to mind?

400
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:42,764
Fine, I'll help.

401
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,969
Jesus R.R. Christ.

402
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:50,205
An innocent girl is a murderer

403
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:52,575
'cause I couldn't
get to her in time.

404
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,809
Oh, put your tit back in
your training bra, wolf boy.

405
00:21:56,115 --> 00:21:58,880
We don't really know
how innocent this girl was.

406
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:00,214
Sleeping with her Uber driver

407
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:02,846
sounds like she had a
death wish to begin with.

408
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:04,686
You're not helping. Drink.

409
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:06,453
Is this a potion? It's alcohol.

410
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,118
Good enough.

411
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:10,390
While you were busy
with your domestic issues,

412
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:13,125
I managed to translate
this Indonesian ritual,

413
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:15,464
and good news is this
is first-year Brakebills

414
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:17,560
multi-culti elective crap.

415
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:20,231
So we can definitely pull it off
without breaking the magic bank.

416
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:24,937
Only prob is finding
one exotic ingredient.

417
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:29,808
Uh, what type of exotic
are we talking about here?

418
00:22:30,316 --> 00:22:33,650
We need a living Komodo
dragon so we can cut out its heart,

419
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:36,689
and I heard a rumor Kanye keeps
one in his New York apartment.

420
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:39,315
That sounds on-brand. Let's go.

421
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:44,888
Uh, wait. I have to
give you something.

422
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,295
It's loaded with silver bullets.

423
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:52,361
The Quickening has started
to do weird things to me and...

424
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,833
Well, if I wolf-out,

425
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:56,375
you might need to stop me.

426
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:02,080
It's not gonna come to that.

427
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:04,444
I promise.

428
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:09,150
Now come on. Let's
go steal Kanye's lizard.

429
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:41,443
As you can see, rather
hard to get in unseen.

430
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,489
Not if you can bend light.

431
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:46,150
Regardless, stealing
the books isn't really

432
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:47,591
the biggest issue, is it?

433
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,740
If the Library discovers they're
gone, they're gonna come after you.

434
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:52,073
Yeah, but if they read my book,

435
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,725
they'll know
exactly where I'll be.

436
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:57,629
Yes, but what if
they read your book

437
00:23:57,703 --> 00:23:59,797
and still had no idea
where you were?

438
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:03,402
What are you proposing?

439
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:08,140
When I was writing <i>The Wandering
Dune,</i> I was also studying magic.

440
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:10,415
Now, I kept blowing deadlines

441
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:13,714
until I found a spell
for automatic writing.

442
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:17,746
Now, you feed it a premise and
it constructs an airtight storyline.

443
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:20,315
I gather they use it in
Hollywood all the time.

444
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:22,522
That explains Netflix.

445
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:25,327
How does this spell work?

446
00:24:25,531 --> 00:24:28,262
Why, we steal the
manuscripts, pull the endings,

447
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:29,978
cast a spell on them,
and then replace them

448
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:32,301
just before they take them
away to bind them as books.

449
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:34,306
<i>Voilà.</i> Oh, you'll
be very surprised

450
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:35,864
how your stories turn out.

451
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:37,102
Let me guess.

452
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:39,896
You'll show me how to do the spell
if I help you with the <i>World Book?</i>

453
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:42,013
Well, that only
seems fair, doesn't it?

454
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:46,844
Look, do you want
my help or not?

455
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:58,625
Mom, I told you I'd have this
done by tomorrow, so just...

456
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:00,532
Jesus.

457
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:02,691
Hello?

458
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:05,699
I found these in your
dead father's fridge.

459
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:09,264
They're not quite what
I'd hoped they'd be.

460
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,610
You finished with
the killing yet?

461
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:13,077
With the, uh...

462
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:14,145
What?

463
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:17,741
Your father's dead. I thought,
perhaps, you'd get angry and kill things.

464
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:18,816
That's what I'd do.

465
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:21,448
It's not really what people do.

466
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:23,617
Nowadays, anyway.

467
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:26,716
You're not going
to kill anything?

468
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:28,388
Interesting.

469
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:32,993
Frozen peas?

470
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:34,795
Nope. No, thanks.

471
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:38,163
Let's go, then.

472
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:39,830
I'm bored of this food.

473
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:42,500
Can I just have a few
minutes to finish this?

474
00:25:46,412 --> 00:25:47,573
This is important to you?

475
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,513
Yeah, it is.

476
00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:54,286
This is a very interesting game,

477
00:25:54,353 --> 00:25:57,016
the loving your dead dad game.

478
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,360
I don't understand it.

479
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,490
It's not a game. It...

480
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,731
There must be someone
who's important to you,

481
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:10,859
who you... Who you miss.

482
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:13,404
I don't remember.

483
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:15,469
But perhaps you're right.

484
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:17,442
I could learn
something from this.

485
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:20,702
I'll let you play this game.

486
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:25,446
I will sit still, and I
won't kill anything

487
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:27,145
and I'll watch you while you...

488
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:29,415
You think about
your dead father?

489
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:31,047
Is that what you're doing?

490
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,120
Yeah. Kind of.

491
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:38,596
This is the weirdest
thing I've ever done.

492
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:45,030
But maybe it'll be fun.

493
00:26:56,115 --> 00:27:01,986
I... She wasn't lying.
This is pretty intimate.

494
00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:03,821
Yeah, well,

495
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:06,654
you're not the one who has to
strip naked and be anointed with oil.

496
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,696
Are you sure you
want to do this?

497
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,465
I don't really see
another way, do you?

498
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:17,792
Wait. Um...

499
00:27:19,438 --> 00:27:21,566
Maybe there is
another way? Uh...

500
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,401
Something a little less painful?

501
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:26,574
Painful? Not painful. Um...

502
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,475
You know I'm not broken, right?

503
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,518
I'm not some flower or
a delicate piece of glass.

504
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:40,152
I'm a person, and people heal.

505
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:44,422
Yeah, look, I... I'm just not
very comfortable with the way

506
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:45,607
this is going down, you know?

507
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:47,191
Yeah, well, this
isn't really about you.

508
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:50,432
So maybe you could
just get over yourself.

509
00:27:51,937 --> 00:27:53,200
I'm trying.

510
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,066
It's nothing you
haven't seen before.

511
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,372
Ta-da.

512
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:11,152
I guess I should start.

513
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,452
I guess you should. Yeah.

514
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:42,281
<i>I do what I want
Don't do what I'm told</i>

515
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,024
<i>What I'm told</i>

516
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:48,426
<i>Been riding on the edge</i>

517
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:51,019
<i>With your heart in a chokehold</i>

518
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:53,327
<i>Heart in a chokehold</i>

519
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:56,829
<i>Maybe I'm a lost cause</i>

520
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,697
What's wrong?

521
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:01,364
I, uh...

522
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,342
I got to go up front.

523
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:06,736
<i>Won't do what I'm told</i>

524
00:29:06,812 --> 00:29:09,145
Are you asking if you
can touch my boobs?

525
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:13,185
I am asking you if I
can touch your boobs.

526
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,910
You can touch my boobs.

527
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,421
Just don't break them.

528
00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:18,750
Ha-ha.

529
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:26,456
<i>You should know You
should know You should know</i>

530
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:27,760
<i>Oh</i>

531
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:28,957
What?

532
00:29:29,034 --> 00:29:30,559
No, it's just... It's cold.

533
00:29:30,636 --> 00:29:33,902
Oh, I'm sorry. I can warm it up.

534
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:37,306
<i>I don't know how to
give you my love, babe</i>

535
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:40,403
<i>'Cause I'm too
good at messing it up</i>

536
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:44,845
<i>Maybe I could change</i>

537
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:48,375
<i>By now you should
know everything is strange</i>

538
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,649
It's weird for me,
too, you know.

539
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:55,591
<i>Give you my love</i>

540
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:58,529
<i>Give you my love</i>

541
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:01,624
<i>I don't know how
to give you my love</i>

542
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,099
You ready to wash my feet?

543
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,709
Now what? Scream!

544
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:23,819
Now eat it! Uh...

545
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:31,491
It's not bad, actually.

546
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:37,266
I told you, vulnerable is
not technically endangered.

547
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:38,413
I think I'm going to be sick.

548
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:40,133
Don't you dare throw
up that lizard heart.

549
00:30:40,205 --> 00:30:41,316
We killed a vulnerable creature

550
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,399
to save your ass.

551
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:44,102
It better not be for nothing.

552
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:47,044
Not to mention that is not the
way I thought I'd meet Kanye.

553
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:48,608
It's actually less messed up

554
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,920
than the way I thought it'd be.

555
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:50,981
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

556
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:54,286
<i>You want me, Josh?</i>

557
00:30:58,123 --> 00:31:00,922
<i>You know what would
be hot right now?</i>

558
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:04,019
<i>If you just took me
right here in this car.</i>

559
00:31:05,564 --> 00:31:06,998
Stop the car! What is it?

560
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:08,795
Pull the car over
right fucking now!

561
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,002
No, no!

562
00:31:45,771 --> 00:31:48,331
Son of a clit!

563
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:49,670
The ritual didn't work.

564
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,108
Oh, is that why you screamed
and ran out of the car?

565
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:53,702
Just let me in, okay?

566
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:55,907
Why? So you can
wolf-hump me to death?

567
00:31:55,981 --> 00:31:59,884
No, I wanted to do things,
but you're safe now, okay?

568
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:01,078
It passed. How?

569
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,820
I kind of turned a
tree into a werewolf,

570
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,381
if you know what I'm saying.

571
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:07,458
Oh, got it.

572
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:09,952
It's not a permanent solution.

573
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:11,621
But it's enough to
keep the urges off

574
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:13,460
until we get to
where we're going.

575
00:32:13,532 --> 00:32:15,398
You mind telling me
where that is, maple dick?

576
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:18,133
Brakebills.

577
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:22,097
I thought this
would be interesting.

578
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:23,600
It's not.

579
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:25,605
I'm almost done. Just...

580
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,946
A little while longer
and then we can go.

581
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:35,084
Why did you do that?
Slightly more interesting.

582
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:36,212
No.

583
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:38,181
Stop it!

584
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:42,558
I don't understand.
Your father is dead, right?

585
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,892
So these belong to
you now, do they not?

586
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,022
Yes, they belong to me.

587
00:32:46,932 --> 00:32:48,195
What is your point?

588
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:49,928
Why are you doing any of this?

589
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:53,199
Because I told my
mom I would, okay?

590
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:58,305
Jesus Christ, I can't believe
I'm having to explain this.

591
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:02,279
Why does your mother have
such strange power over you?

592
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:06,281
Because once, when I was a kid,

593
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:07,979
I broke an ashtray.

594
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:10,547
And now she still fucking thinks

595
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:11,622
that I break everything.

596
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:13,858
Because...

597
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:18,129
Basically, your parents never
change how they see you.

598
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:19,196
No matter what.

599
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,426
So if they can't change
how they see you,

600
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:25,027
then why does it matter?

601
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:29,171
Because sometimes
I think she's right.

602
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,904
Things break around me.

603
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:36,175
Alice, my dad,

604
00:33:36,281 --> 00:33:38,580
all of goddamn magic.

605
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,781
Then break them on purpose.

606
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:42,886
They're your planes.

607
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,853
You can do what
you want with them.

608
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,326
Maybe you'll feel better.

609
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:54,135
I don't mean to be rude,

610
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,857
but here I am helping as promised
without an assurance you'll do the same.

611
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,158
Jesus, you're relentless.

612
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,495
Okay, fine. I'll help
you with your spell.

613
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:03,125
Yet you seem to
hate yourself for it.

614
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:06,032
I mean, you can
understand my worry.

615
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,506
I don't have to
be happy about it.

616
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:09,573
A word of advice.

617
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:12,374
If you want to survive,
stop torturing yourself.

618
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:14,879
Maybe you could do with
a little more self-hatred.

619
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:17,239
And fewer Mr. Rogers vests.

620
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:20,980
You think that what you've done
and who you are, are the same thing.

621
00:35:21,753 --> 00:35:23,483
When they don't match
up, you hate yourself.

622
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:25,918
Alice, they'll never match up.

623
00:35:25,991 --> 00:35:27,516
You don't know
anything about me.

624
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:29,437
I know what it feels like
to be unable to change

625
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:30,929
no matter how much I want to.

626
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:35,266
Children don't care if you
contradict yourself, you know?

627
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:38,412
Perhaps that's a bad
example coming from me,

628
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:39,556
but I'm just trying to help.

629
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:44,467
Please just stop doing...

630
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:51,942
What is it?

631
00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:53,679
The end of Quentin's book.

632
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:56,084
He's going to die.

633
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:58,946
Isn't that how all books end?

634
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,354
His ends next week.

635
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,190
And as requested,

636
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:09,996
the water my feet
were bathed in.

637
00:36:13,405 --> 00:36:14,532
That's pretty murky.

638
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:16,267
Okay, judgey.

639
00:36:16,808 --> 00:36:17,867
What's it mean?

640
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:19,668
It's too early to say.

641
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,045
This is very
interesting, though.

642
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:25,206
I thought you said you
didn't have any power.

643
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:29,280
No. I don't. I... I can't do
magic. Those aren't the same.

644
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:31,819
Oh, this,

645
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:35,225
this is real weird.

646
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:39,926
You weren't bullshitting me

647
00:36:39,998 --> 00:36:41,899
when you said you were
a goddess, were you?

648
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:46,529
No, but how... How can I be a
goddess if I don't have any power?

649
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:48,971
Maybe you think
you don't, but...

650
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:54,036
I have never seen
anything like this before.

651
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,678
So we're good now?

652
00:36:57,749 --> 00:37:00,514
You're not gonna kill yourself?

653
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:02,144
No, I can't now.

654
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,121
I have a new deity to follow.

655
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:08,392
Oh, boy.

656
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,230
I think you're overreacting.

657
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,839
I could've sexually
assaulted you or ate you.

658
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,551
I don't honestly know how
things would've turned out.

659
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,840
It's no reason to give up.
There's got to be a solution.

660
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,641
I've got, what, a couple hours
before The Quickening takes over,

661
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:31,046
and I'm sorry if that makes
me a wimp or whatever,

662
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:32,880
but I don't want to
rape or murder anyone.

663
00:37:32,951 --> 00:37:34,044
Oh, come on.

664
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:36,921
There are plenty of people
who deserve to be killed.

665
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:39,689
I can think of a half
dozen at Brakebills alone.

666
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,318
If you can just keep
your twat together,

667
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,193
I'm sure I can get at least
one of them down here.

668
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,128
I mean, Todd totally owes me.

669
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:49,530
He doesn't owe you
his life. Doesn't he?

670
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,103
I can't do it, Margo.

671
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:55,801
Well, you can't do nothing,

672
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:57,536
because you'll die in this cage.

673
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,043
At least I can live with that.

674
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,770
I mean, not live exactly,

675
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:03,474
but you... You get
what I'm saying.

676
00:38:03,548 --> 00:38:04,846
This is bullshit.

677
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,876
You're just throwing
your life away.

678
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:08,585
I was thinking more
like noble sacrifice.

679
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:10,485
Screw your noble sacrifice!

680
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:14,517
What is it with you boys
and your noble sacrifice?

681
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:15,992
I'm not gonna let you do it.

682
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,153
Well, it's not your choice.

683
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,695
You can't fix me, okay?

684
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:19,992
Some things are just broken,

685
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:21,208
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

686
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:22,860
Said the quitter
right before he quit.

687
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:25,836
You think I want to die?
Of course I fucking don't!

688
00:38:25,904 --> 00:38:28,315
But... But I don't see a way out of
this, and frankly you not giving up

689
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:29,699
is making what I
have to do harder.

690
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,411
You want to do something stupid?

691
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:44,252
Fine by me.

692
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,442
What the hell are you doing?

693
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,725
Something stupider.

694
00:38:50,228 --> 00:38:53,562
This isn't a joke, Margo. I... I'm
not going to be able to control myself.

695
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:55,691
I might kill you or...

696
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:56,996
Or... Or what?

697
00:38:59,304 --> 00:39:00,636
Fuck me?

698
00:39:03,308 --> 00:39:04,606
Margo.

699
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:08,171
This curse isn't curable.

700
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,242
I don't want you
to go through this.

701
00:39:10,315 --> 00:39:11,908
The... The Quickening
is... Why not?

702
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:12,983
Because...

703
00:39:13,885 --> 00:39:15,319
I like you.

704
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:17,682
I like you, too.

705
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:23,189
And I'm not gonna lose
another friend today, okay?

706
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,493
I can't make you kill someone,

707
00:39:30,335 --> 00:39:32,133
but I can consent.

708
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:41,145
Damn.

709
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,272
The Quickening makes
you a really good kisser.

710
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:44,714
I know.

711
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:54,485
That was more cathartic
than I thought it would be.

712
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:57,222
It was kind of fun, wasn't it?

713
00:40:00,665 --> 00:40:04,898
It feels good after you
deal with death, doesn't it?

714
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:07,262
A little.

715
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:08,567
Still hurts,

716
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,702
but eventually it
hurts a little less.

717
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,776
Uh-huh.

718
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:18,608
I'm going to need your
help to search for more gods.

719
00:40:18,683 --> 00:40:21,551
You'll be more useful
to me if you feel better,

720
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:26,353
so you should know that
your friend Eliot is dead.

721
00:40:30,228 --> 00:40:33,164
You can smash more
things if you want.

722
00:40:33,231 --> 00:40:35,632
And then we'll go
get something to eat.

723
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:38,233
Sound good?

724
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,742
I cannot believe
you just did that.

725
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,913
I rocked your
world. Get over it.

726
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:54,544
Oh, no, you... That was great.

727
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:58,078
It's just you can't have
sex now with anyone

728
00:40:58,156 --> 00:41:01,957
who isn't L-positive
without infecting them.

729
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,784
You know, so...

730
00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:06,525
Since when is P-in-the-V sex

731
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:09,499
the pinnacle of what
one or two or three or five

732
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:11,331
or an animal can do together?

733
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:14,204
I mean, it's not
even on my top 10.

734
00:41:16,107 --> 00:41:17,735
I guess I see your point there.

735
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,236
All the same,

736
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,041
what are you gonna do
about The Quickening?

737
00:41:22,113 --> 00:41:23,706
How... How are you
gonna handle that?

738
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,909
In what, 30 years?

739
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,475
No way I'm gonna live that long.

740
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,350
And if I do, Todd
totally owes me.

741
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,319
You're joking, right?

742
00:41:31,723 --> 00:41:32,986
You're joking.

743
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:39,862
So what is this? This is...

744
00:41:39,931 --> 00:41:42,059
This is just casual, right?

745
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:44,830
We're not... You know?

746
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:48,269
I saved your
fucking life, bitch.

747
00:41:50,141 --> 00:41:51,769
Casual that.

748
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:55,503
Thanks, Margo.

749
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,250
I'm sorry we couldn't

750
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:02,150
figure out a way to help,

751
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,518
you know...

752
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:07,786
I am, too.

753
00:42:10,328 --> 00:42:12,957
I would have done
anything to save him.

754
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:19,399
But I think he might
actually be gone.

755
00:42:24,342 --> 00:42:26,504
<i>I felt the moment his soul died.</i>

756
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,111
It only hurt for a second.

757
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:35,381
I promise he didn't suffer.

758
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,915
You'll come around.

759
00:42:40,091 --> 00:42:41,559
I know it.

760
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:50,835
<i>Let's take it right back</i>

761
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,495
<i>Hello?</i>

762
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:57,067
<i>But we never look back</i>

763
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:59,542
<i>No, we only look forward</i>

764
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:03,570
<i>To all the new pain</i>

765
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:06,549
<i>And violence that we blame</i>

766
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:08,381
<i>No, we never look back</i>

767
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,951
<i>No, we only look forward</i>

768
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:13,557
Hello?

769
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:14,922
<i>With all our fate</i>

770
00:43:15,026 --> 00:43:18,292
<i>Hearts broken from the start</i>

771
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,326
Is anybody there?

772
00:43:21,899 --> 00:43:24,198
Margo!

773
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:28,296
<i>Only to be held tall</i>

774
00:43:28,406 --> 00:43:31,399
<i>By the writing on the wall</i>

775
00:43:31,476 --> 00:43:35,470
<i>We don't need no
premonitions, no</i>

776
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:43,987
<i>Let's take it right back</i>

777
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:46,956
<i>To where it all began</i>

778
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:49,994
<i>But we never look back</i>

779
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:52,325
<i>No, we only look forward</i>

780
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:55,958
<i>To all the new shame</i>

781
00:43:56,067 --> 00:43:58,593
<i>And waste of what we gain</i>
