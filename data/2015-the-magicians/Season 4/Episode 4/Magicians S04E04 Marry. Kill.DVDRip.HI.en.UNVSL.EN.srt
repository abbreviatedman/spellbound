Then you'll poison him.

How you can be such a good friend

24
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:54,247

at the exact same time.

Don't speak to me of done-sies.

tied to the lunar cycle

are mostly non-lethal,

lycanthropes experience urges

167
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:21,259
starting in the form of
nightmares or even waking dreams.

00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:48,456
Why can't I just lock
myself up in a cage

176
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,053
until The Quickening passes?

177
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,725
Because that won't
satisfy the urge.

178
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,792
You need to have sex or kill
or you'll rip your own guts out.

179
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,236
That's how the curse
is ensured to spread.

180
00:08:58,304 --> 00:08:59,499
It's quite clever, actually.

181
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:00,767
Oh, yeah, real clever

182
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:02,151
how I'm going to rape
or murder someone

183
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:03,666
in the next two
days, no matter what.

184
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,611
If you try to suppress it, it's
always possible you'll do both

185
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,341
or commit suicide.

186
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:11,044
Just, you know, to have
all the options on the table.

187
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:13,016
What the hell am I going to do?

188
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,486
What... What are we going to do?

189
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:18,321
Have you considered
Tinder? What? No.

190
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,259
Because I have a
really, really bad STD

191
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:24,126
and that sort of kills the
desire to sleep with anyone.

192
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:25,995
So forget... Mmm-hmm.

193
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,295
Wait.

194
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,268
Did you do that?

195
00:09:30,336 --> 00:09:32,532
Yes. And it worked.

196
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:35,734
That is why I am not
going crazy right now. Huh.

197
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,735
Oh, you are very charming, Josh.

198
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:42,042
I'm sure you'll have no
trouble finding someone

199
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:43,640
to dance with before, you know,

200
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:45,708
the wolf makes a choice for you.

201
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,046
Good luck, Josh.

202
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:55,794
PLOVER: The Librarians
don't know I've been living here.

203
00:09:55,862 --> 00:09:58,457
Apologies for the mess.

204
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:02,427
Oh, and, uh, for how
I brought you here.

205
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:04,198
I didn't mean to be rough.

206
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,934
I just wanted to get you out
of sight before you got caught.

207
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,176
You do remember me,
don't you? I'm Christopher...

208
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:12,473
Plover.

209
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:15,873
You're the child molester
who's directly responsible

210
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,974
for Martin Chatwin
becoming The Beast.

211
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:22,521
I also wrote some
very popular books.

212
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:24,283
How did you end up here anyway?

213
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,917
Oh, that's a long
and boring story.

214
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,120
(SIGHS)

215
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:30,720
The important thing is
we can help each other.

216
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,129
See, I need an extra
pair of hands. No.

217
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:38,631
And yet I know very well
that you could use my help.

218
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:41,504
You're trying to escape
The Order, aren't you?

219
00:10:41,574 --> 00:10:42,940
From the looks
of it, we both are.

220
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:48,074
You didn't leave with
Santa Claus. Why not?

221
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:52,312
I get sleigh-sick. You
can say what you want.

222
00:10:52,452 --> 00:10:55,616
But I know the real reason... Oh,
please don't touch that. Please.

223
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:58,248
The real reason
you stayed behind.

224
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:03,260
You were looking for your
book, yours and your friends'.

225
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,795
Do you have them?

226
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,766
The books are in
the Revision Room.

227
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:11,430
But I happen to
know where that is.

228
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:15,839
So you help me with my little
something, and I'll take you there.

229
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:17,207
Deal?

230
00:11:22,715 --> 00:11:25,617
LAURA: I don't know why your
father made so many of them.

231
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,745
He liked planes. (CHUCKLES)

232
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,852
A creative outlet.

233
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:35,889
He's dead, Mom. We
can stop criticizing him.

234
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:39,399
I didn't want to be here at all, you
know, but there was no one else.

235
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:41,662
Molly is furious.

236
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:43,396
You know how she felt about Ted.

237
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:46,169
I know, I'm sorry, I...

238
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,337
I was traveling and my
phone died and I... (SCOFFS)

239
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:53,309
You're the only
millennial I know

240
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,177
who isn't buried
in his phone 24/7.

241
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:56,944
Are we going to do this again?

242
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,281
(SIGHING)

243
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:04,415
What was wrong with him, huh?

244
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,551
People make
friends. That's normal.

245
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:12,227
He was normal. I divorced
him, he was so normal,

246
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,198
so where are his
goddamn friends?

247
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,537
There was no one at the funeral.

248
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,435
I don't know.

249
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:22,000
Did he ever date?

250
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,703
Never mind. I
don't want to know.

251
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,475
Okay, so we pack these boxes.

252
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,110
Yeah, unless you want
to keep all this junk.

253
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:35,130
I found a guy upstate. He'll
take them off your hands,

254
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,589
but you have to get
it done by tomorrow.

255
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:44,858
I... I got it. Okay,
just, um, be careful.

256
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,062
Don't break anything.

257
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:53,868
Christ on a goddamn
communion wafer.

258
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,104
It's like I'm caught in a
real-life game of marry-fuck-kill,

259
00:12:57,176 --> 00:12:58,838
only "marry" is off the table.

260
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:03,007
What are you gonna do about
it? I have no goddamn clue.

261
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,027
Why do you think I'm sitting
here with my head in my hands,

262
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:07,418
the traditional Hoberman
despair position?

263
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:10,286
Okay, then here's a plan.

264
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,286
We're going to
fix this bullshit.

265
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:14,418
I don't want to add to
your problems, Margo.

266
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:16,054
So 'cause of that,
you're gonna sit back

267
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,892
and just let this
shit happen to you?

268
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:19,392
Huh?

269
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,525
This ain't prom night,

270
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:23,769
and the only thing
I know for sure

271
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:26,635
is you're not going to fix
anything if you nutsack out on me.

272
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:29,266
I won't nutsack out.

273
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:31,573
Good. That's
what I want to hear.

274
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:35,006
Because we are going to
find a way out of this thing,

275
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:37,609
or we're gonna die trying.

276
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,310
(SIGHING)

277
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:48,070
I'm starting to see why no one's
ever beaten this curse. It's like herpes.

278
00:13:48,094 --> 00:13:51,258
Cockroach-in-a-nuclear-war-level
impossible to stomp out.

279
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:55,291
Well, I found some shit on a
ritual from an Indonesian tribe.

280
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:58,667
It's supposed to prevent
supernatural transformations.

281
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:02,005
Or maybe cause them.
My Indonesian sucks.

282
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:03,475
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

283
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:05,912
Uber alert.

284
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:09,039
You know, these surge
prices are really getting out of...

285
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:12,108
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

286
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,019
Okay, surge prices piss me
off, too, but are you all right?

287
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:18,124
I've always been upfront
about my L-positive status

288
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,559
with any potential partners
before anything happens.

289
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:24,654
What's that have to do
with Uber? Isaac wasn't.

290
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,423
Oh.

291
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:29,128
So how many people
did Isaac do doggy-style?

292
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,570
Just one, and I'm going
to go warn her now.

293
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,331
Uh-huh. Yup! What a Monday!

294
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,739
So this book is used
to help me locate

295
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,645
different worlds via
a cooperative spell?

296
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,707
It is called <i>The World Book.</i>

297
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:48,084
Yes, I can read. So it's
like the encyclopedia.

298
00:14:48,154 --> 00:14:51,283
More like an atlas. What
world are you looking for?

299
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:54,919
One where I can be
happy, where I can belong.

300
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:59,823
(SIGHING) No, it's not what
you think. I'm not interested in that.

301
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,391
I just want to go somewhere
where I can do no harm.

302
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,061
I'll never do that again.
I swear on my life.

303
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,573
Yeah, well, I don't
know if I believe you.

304
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:11,109
I spent years being
tortured by Martin,

305
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,037
plenty of time to
think on my actions

306
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,439
and regret them.

307
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:21,747
Did you never unintentionally
hurt someone you love, Alice?

308
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:25,690
I never molested a child.

309
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:28,795
But, yes, I've
done things I regret.

310
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:31,729
Don't you deserve happiness? No.

311
00:15:31,898 --> 00:15:35,665
Oh, come on, don't be so hard
on yourself. We all deserve it.

312
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:37,636
I don't think you do.

313
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:40,897
I don't particularly
care what you think.

314
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:42,873
You need my help
finding the Revision Room.

315
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,570
So either you help
me with this spell,

316
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:46,442
or you're on your own.

317
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:48,074
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

318
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,714
Who are you? Hi, uh, I'm Josh.

319
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,377
I'm Isaac's friend.

320
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:55,685
Isaac.

321
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:58,384
He hooked up with
you that one time.

322
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,482
Oh.

323
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,626
Right.

324
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:05,260
Look, it's a really
bad time right now.

325
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:07,643
Oh, uh, no, Isaac really wanted
me to talk to you about something,

326
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:11,297
and it's kind of an emergency.
So can I come in, please?

327
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,905
How do you know Isaac again?

328
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,566
Oh, uh...

329
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,907
He and I met at Jewish camp.

330
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:22,108
This is kind of weird. I mean,
why did he send a friend

331
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:23,492
instead of, like,
calling me himself?

332
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:27,817
He's got, uh, laryngitis.
So he can't text?

333
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:30,617
And he broke all of his fingers.

334
00:16:31,023 --> 00:16:35,119
Anyhoo, I've got to talk to
you about Isaac's problem,

335
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:39,529
which he's embarrassed because
he came down with something,

336
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,499
and he's afraid that you
might have caught it from him.

337
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:46,299
Caught what? Oh, just a

338
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:48,135
herpes-like thing.

339
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:51,301
He gave me herpes? I
believe I said "herpes-like."

340
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,844
Well, what the hell is it?

341
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:54,456
The only way to know
if you got it is to sort of

342
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,658
go through the symptoms and see
if you've been experiencing them.

343
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,413
Okay, Josh from Jewish camp,

344
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:01,579
I'm going to
discuss genital warts

345
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:05,022
and discharge with
you 'cause we just met.

346
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:07,893
Jesus Christ. Fuck my life!

347
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,727
Look, have you maybe not
been feeling yourself lately?

348
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:14,528
Not really. And I'm
beginning to wonder

349
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,040
why I let you in,
in the first place.

350
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:19,561
Great, and, uh, have you
maybe been having dreams

351
00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:21,904
that are weird and violent?

352
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,233
Maybe.

353
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,803
Right, well, this last one
might sound a little crazy,

354
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,841
but have you maybe been unable
to control yourself around guys?

355
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,686
Get out of my apartment.

356
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:36,098
Oh, wait. No, no,
no. This wasn't me

357
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:37,499
trying to freak you
out. Seriously, get out!

358
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:42,359
Okay, please, just let me
help you. I just want to help.

359
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,723
(VOICE BREAKING) It's been
a really hard couple of days.

360
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:52,097
I've been totally
freaking, like...

361
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,666
What's wrong with me?
I know what you mean,

362
00:17:56,742 --> 00:18:00,338
and it's completely normal,

363
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,815
and I assure you,
this is not your fault.

364
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:08,446
That's so good to hear. I mean,

365
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:13,186
how could I even do
that to someone else?

366
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,752
It's a total mess in
there. (CHUCKLING)

367
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,694
Uh, a mess? Uh, where? Mmm-hmm.

368
00:18:30,142 --> 00:18:31,405
(GASPS)

369
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:36,772
Jesus tits. It's
not that bad, is it?

370
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:44,754
JULIA: Is it possible for an entire
forest to do the walk of shame?

371
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:48,886
PENNY 23: Seriously, nature
is not supposed to be this sticky.

372
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:51,263
(DOG BARKING) Uh-oh.

373
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:54,432
You think she's who
we're looking for?

374
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,397
Whoa, whoa! Wait,
wait! Don't! Why not?

375
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,564
Because you have
something to live for?

376
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,837
I'm a Maenad. The god
that I'm here to serve is dead.

377
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,535
I literally have
nothing to live for.

378
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:08,809
But thanks, thanks for the
less than basic understanding

379
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:10,416
of my life's purpose.

380
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:13,681
No, no, no! Wait! Don't,
please. We need your help.

381
00:19:14,854 --> 00:19:16,083
Shoshana.

382
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,784
Shoshana. We need
your help, Shoshana.

383
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:21,786
Hmm?

384
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:23,956
Peach Schnapps. (CRYING)

385
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,866
Bacchus left that for
the talking bears to find.

386
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:31,631
Okay, so how about a toast?

387
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,696
Right? Ba... Bacchus
would've wanted us to drink.

388
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,032
God, like, so much. Yeah.

389
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,236
Okay, so to Bacchus.

390
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,276
To Bacchus.

391
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:46,251
Oh, God, it smells like pee
sangria. I don't give a shit. Drink it.

392
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:49,186
To, uh, Bacchus! Bacchus.

393
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:50,689
(SOBBING) JULIA: Whoo!

394
00:19:56,896 --> 00:19:59,297
Oh, that's good shit.
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

395
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:03,201
Um, I was a goddess
and I gave away my power,

396
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:07,263
and now I can't use magic.
Only I'm indestructible.

397
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:11,401
So maybe you can help me
understand what is going on.

398
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,141
You were a goddess?

399
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:16,713
Yeah.

400
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,582
(SIGHING)

401
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:20,915
If all these other Maenads

402
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:23,455
hadn't run through the poison
wine like a bunch of bitches,

403
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,753
I wouldn't even
be in this situation!

404
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:28,556
Well, maybe if you
help us, we can...

405
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:29,686
(INHALING SHARPLY)

406
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:31,993
(HOWLING)

407
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,161
(SHOSHANA SHRIEKING) Oh...

408
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:43,742
I'm sorry. What are you...
What are you doing? (PANTING)

409
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,573
I'm trying to read your aura.

410
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:47,078
(ULULATING)

411
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,108
Maybe we can just get the
pine cone out of my face?

412
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:00,424
Okay. That's what I thought.

413
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:02,189
Inconclusive.

414
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,720
I do know a ritual that could
help diagnose you further.

415
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,596
But, um, it's pretty intimate.

416
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:12,004
Um, okay. I can live with that.

417
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:14,506
Yeah, the only thing
is I... I can't perform it.

418
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:16,804
Uh, why not?

419
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:18,242
Well, I don't believe in you.

420
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:19,676
I can help interpret,

421
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:22,772
but you need someone
who believes in you,

422
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,244
okay, who worships you,

423
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:28,116
body and soul,

424
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:30,713
to perform the ritual.

425
00:21:33,092 --> 00:21:34,253
Anyone come to mind?

426
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:42,764
Fine, I'll help.

427
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,969
Jesus R.R. Christ.

428
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:50,205
An innocent girl is a murderer

429
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:52,575
'cause I couldn't
get to her in time.

430
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,809
Oh, put your tit back in
your training bra, wolf boy.

431
00:21:56,115 --> 00:21:58,880
We don't really know
how innocent this girl was.

432
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:00,214
Sleeping with her Uber driver

433
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:02,846
sounds like she had a
death wish to begin with.

434
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:04,686
You're not helping. Drink.

435
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:06,453
Is this a potion? It's alcohol.

436
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,118
Good enough.

437
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:10,390
While you were busy
with your domestic issues,

438
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:13,125
I managed to translate
this Indonesian ritual,

439
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:15,464
and good news is this
is first-year Brakebills

440
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:17,560
multi-culti elective crap.

441
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:20,231
So we can definitely pull it off
without breaking the magic bank.

442
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:24,937
Only prob is finding
one exotic ingredient.

443
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:29,808
Uh, what type of exotic
are we talking about here?

444
00:22:30,316 --> 00:22:33,650
We need a living Komodo
dragon so we can cut out its heart,

445
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:36,689
and I heard a rumor Kanye keeps
one in his New York apartment.

446
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:39,315
That sounds on-brand. Let's go.

447
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:40,689
(SIGHING)

448
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:44,888
Uh, wait. I have to
give you something.

449
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,295
It's loaded with silver bullets.

450
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:52,361
The Quickening has started
to do weird things to me and...

451
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,833
Well, if I wolf-out,

452
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:56,375
you might need to stop me.

453
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:02,080
It's not gonna come to that.

454
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:04,444
I promise.

455
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:09,150
Now come on. Let's
go steal Kanye's lizard.

456
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:41,443
(WHISPERING) As you can
see, rather hard to get in unseen.

457
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,489
Not if you can bend light.

458
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:46,150
Regardless, stealing
the books isn't really

459
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:47,591
the biggest issue, is it?

460
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,740
If the Library discovers they're
gone, they're gonna come after you.

461
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:52,073
Yeah, but if they read my book,

462
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,725
they'll know
exactly where I'll be.

463
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:57,629
Yes, but what if
they read your book

464
00:23:57,703 --> 00:23:59,797
and still had no idea
where you were?

465
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:03,402
What are you proposing?

466
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:08,140
When I was writing <i>The Wandering
Dune,</i> I was also studying magic.

467
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:10,415
Now, I kept blowing deadlines

468
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:13,714
until I found a spell
for automatic writing.

469
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:17,746
Now, you feed it a premise and
it constructs an airtight storyline.

470
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:20,315
I gather they use it in
Hollywood all the time.

471
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:22,522
That explains Netflix.

472
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:25,327
How does this spell work?

473
00:24:25,531 --> 00:24:28,262
Why, we steal the
manuscripts, pull the endings,

474
00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:29,978
cast a spell on them,
and then replace them

475
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:32,301
just before they take them
away to bind them as books.

476
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:34,306
<i>Voilà.</i> Oh, you'll
be very surprised

477
00:24:34,373 --> 00:24:35,864
how your stories turn out.

478
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:37,102
Let me guess.

479
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:39,896
You'll show me how to do the spell
if I help you with the <i>World Book?</i>

480
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:42,013
Well, that only
seems fair, doesn't it?

481
00:24:43,248 --> 00:24:46,844
Look, do you want
my help or not?

482
00:24:53,192 --> 00:24:54,319
(DOOR CLOSES)

483
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:58,625
Mom, I told you I'd have this
done by tomorrow, so just...

484
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:00,532
Jesus.

485
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:02,691
Hello?

486
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:05,699
I found these in your
dead father's fridge.

487
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:09,264
They're not quite what
I'd hoped they'd be.

488
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,610
You finished with
the killing yet?

489
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:13,077
With the, uh...

490
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:14,145
What?

491
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:17,741
Your father's dead. I thought,
perhaps, you'd get angry and kill things.

492
00:25:17,816 --> 00:25:18,816
That's what I'd do.

493
00:25:19,718 --> 00:25:21,448
It's not really what people do.

494
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:23,617
Nowadays, anyway.

495
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:26,716
You're not going
to kill anything?

496
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:28,388
Interesting.

497
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:30,292
(EXHALING DEEPLY)

498
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:32,993
Frozen peas?

499
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:34,795
Nope. No, thanks.

500
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:38,163
Let's go, then.

501
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:39,830
I'm bored of this food.

502
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:42,500
Can I just have a few
minutes to finish this?

503
00:25:46,412 --> 00:25:47,573
This is important to you?

504
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,513
Yeah, it is.

505
00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:54,286
This is a very interesting game,

506
00:25:54,353 --> 00:25:57,016
the loving your dead dad game.

507
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,360
I don't understand it.

508
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,490
It's not a game. It...

509
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,731
There must be someone
who's important to you,

510
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:10,859
who you... Who you miss.

511
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:13,404
I don't remember.

512
00:26:13,739 --> 00:26:15,469
But perhaps you're right.

513
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:17,442
I could learn
something from this.

514
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:20,702
I'll let you play this game.

goddess if I don't have any power?

692
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:48,971
Maybe you think
you don't, but...

693
00:36:50,508 --> 00:36:54,036
I have never seen
anything like this before.

694
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,678
So we're good now?

695
00:36:57,749 --> 00:37:00,514
You're not gonna kill yourself?

696
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:02,144
No, I can't now.

697
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,121
I have a new deity to follow.

698
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:08,392
Oh, boy.

699
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,230
I think you're overreacting.

700
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,839
I could've sexually
assaulted you or ate you.

701
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,551
I don't honestly know how
things would've turned out.

702
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,840
It's no reason to give up.
There's got to be a solution.

703
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,641
I've got, what, a couple hours
before The Quickening takes over,

704
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:31,046
and I'm sorry if that makes
me a wimp or whatever,

705
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:32,880
but I don't want to
rape or murder anyone.

706
00:37:32,951 --> 00:37:34,044
Oh, come on.

707
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:36,921
There are plenty of people
who deserve to be killed.

708
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:39,689
I can think of a half
dozen at Brakebills alone.

709
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,318
If you can just keep
your twat together,

710
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,193
I'm sure I can get at least
one of them down here.

711
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,128
I mean, Todd totally owes me.

712
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:49,530
He doesn't owe you
his life. Doesn't he?

713
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,103
I can't do it, Margo.

714
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:55,801
Well, you can't do nothing,

715
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:57,536
because you'll die in this cage.

716
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,043
At least I can live with that.

717
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,770
I mean, not live exactly,

718
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:03,474
but you... You get
what I'm saying.

719
00:38:03,548 --> 00:38:04,846
This is bullshit.

720
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,876
You're just throwing
your life away.

721
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:08,585
I was thinking more
like noble sacrifice.

722
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:10,485
Screw your noble sacrifice!

723
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:14,517
What is it with you boys
and your noble sacrifice?

724
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:15,992
I'm not gonna let you do it.

725
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,153
Well, it's not your choice.

726
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,695
You can't fix me, okay?

727
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:19,992
Some things are just broken,

728
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:21,208
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

729
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:22,860
Said the quitter
right before he quit.

730
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:25,836
You think I want to die?
Of course I fucking don't!

731
00:38:25,904 --> 00:38:28,315
But... But I don't see a way out of
this, and frankly you not giving up

732
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:29,699
is making what I
have to do harder.

733
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,411
You want to do something stupid?

734
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:44,252
Fine by me.

735
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,442
What the hell are you doing?

736
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,725
Something stupider.

737
00:38:50,228 --> 00:38:53,562
This isn't a joke, Margo. I... I'm
not going to be able to control myself.

738
00:38:53,631 --> 00:38:55,691
I might kill you or...

739
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:56,996
Or... Or what?

740
00:38:59,304 --> 00:39:00,636
Fuck me?

741
00:39:03,308 --> 00:39:04,606
Margo.

742
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:08,171
This curse isn't curable.

743
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,242
I don't want you
to go through this.

744
00:39:10,315 --> 00:39:11,908
The... The Quickening
is... Why not?

745
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:12,983
Because...

746
00:39:13,885 --> 00:39:15,319
I like you.

747
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:17,682
I like you, too.

748
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:23,189
And I'm not gonna lose
another friend today, okay?

749
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,493
I can't make you kill someone,

750
00:39:30,335 --> 00:39:32,133
but I can consent.

751
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:41,145
Damn.

752
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,272
The Quickening makes
you a really good kisser.

753
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:44,714
I know.

754
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:54,485
That was more cathartic
than I thought it would be.

755
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:57,222
It was kind of fun, wasn't it?

756
00:40:00,665 --> 00:40:04,898
It feels good after you
deal with death, doesn't it?

757
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:07,262
A little.

758
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:08,567
Still hurts,

759
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,702
but eventually it
hurts a little less.

760
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,776
Uh-huh.

761
00:40:15,513 --> 00:40:18,608
I'm going to need your
help to search for more gods.

762
00:40:18,683 --> 00:40:21,551
You'll be more useful
to me if you feel better,

763
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:26,353
so you should know that
your friend Eliot is dead.

764
00:40:30,228 --> 00:40:33,164
You can smash more
things if you want.

765
00:40:33,231 --> 00:40:35,632
And then we'll go
get something to eat.

766
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:38,233
Sound good?

767
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,742
I cannot believe
you just did that.

768
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,913
I rocked your
world. Get over it.

769
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:54,544
Oh, no, you... That was great.

770
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:58,078
It's just you can't have
sex now with anyone

771
00:40:58,156 --> 00:41:01,957
who isn't L-positive
without infecting them.

772
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,784
You know, so...

773
00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:06,525
Since when is P-in-the-V sex

774
00:41:06,597 --> 00:41:09,499
the pinnacle of what
one or two or three or five

775
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:11,331
or an animal can do together?

776
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:14,204
I mean, it's not
even on my top 10.

777
00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:15,501
(CHUCKLES)

778
00:41:16,107 --> 00:41:17,735
I guess I see your point there.

779
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,236
All the same,

780
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,041
what are you gonna do
about The Quickening?

781
00:41:22,113 --> 00:41:23,706
How... How are you
gonna handle that?

782
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,909
In what, 30 years?

783
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,475
No way I'm gonna live that long.

784
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:29,350
And if I do, Todd
totally owes me.

785
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,319
You're joking, right?

786
00:41:31,723 --> 00:41:32,986
You're joking.

787
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,493
(LAUGHS)

788
00:41:37,028 --> 00:41:39,862
So what is this? This is...

789
00:41:39,931 --> 00:41:42,059
(STAMMERS) This
is just casual, right?

790
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:44,830
We're not... You know?

791
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:48,269
I saved your
fucking life, bitch.

792
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,339
(SCOFFS)

793
00:41:50,141 --> 00:41:51,769
Casual that.

794
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:55,503
Thanks, Margo.

795
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,250
I'm sorry we couldn't

796
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:02,150
figure out a way to help,

797
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,518
you know...

798
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:07,786
I am, too.

799
00:42:10,328 --> 00:42:12,957
I would have done
anything to save him.

800
00:42:16,634 --> 00:42:19,399
But I think he might
actually be gone.

801
00:42:24,342 --> 00:42:26,504
THE MONSTER: <i>I felt
the moment his soul died.</i>

802
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,111
It only hurt for a second.

803
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:35,381
I promise he didn't suffer.

804
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:37,813
(LAUGHS)

805
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,915
You'll come around.

806
00:42:40,091 --> 00:42:41,559
I know it.

807
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:50,835
MAN: (SINGING)
<i>Let's take it right back</i>

808
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,495
ELIOT: (YELLING) <i>Hello?</i>

809
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:57,067
<i>But we never look back</i>

810
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:59,542
<i>No, we only look forward</i>

811
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:03,570
<i>To all the new pain</i>

812
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:06,549
<i>And violence that we blame</i>

813
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:08,381
<i>No, we never look back</i>

814
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,951
<i>No, we only look forward</i>

815
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:13,557
Hello?

816
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:14,922
<i>With all our fate</i>

817
00:43:15,026 --> 00:43:18,292
<i>Hearts broken from the start</i>

818
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,326
(YELLS) Is anybody there?

819
00:43:21,899 --> 00:43:24,198
Margo!

820
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:28,296
<i>Only to be held tall</i>

821
00:43:28,406 --> 00:43:31,399
<i>By the writing on the wall</i>

822
00:43:31,476 --> 00:43:35,470
<i>We don't need no
premonitions, no</i>

823
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:43,987
<i>Let's take it right back</i>

824
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:46,956
<i>To where it all began</i>

825
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:49,994
<i>But we never look back</i>

826
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:52,325
<i>No, we only look forward</i>

827
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:55,958
<i>To all the new shame</i>

828
00:43:56,067 --> 00:43:58,593
<i>And waste of what we gain</i>
