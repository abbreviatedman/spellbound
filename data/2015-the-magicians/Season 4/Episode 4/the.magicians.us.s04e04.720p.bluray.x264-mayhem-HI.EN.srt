How you can be such a good friend

24

or wolf-ness.

174
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:44,597
I took your class, Helen.
I know what lupinity means.

175
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:48,443
Why can't I just
lock myself up in a cage

176
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,019
until The Quickening passes?

177
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:52,696
Because that won't
satisfy the urge.

178
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,775
You need to have sex or kill
or you'll rip your own guts out.

179
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,202
That's how the curse
is ensured to spread.

180
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,495
It's quite clever, actually.

181
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:00,788
Oh, yeah, real clever

182
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,143
how I'm going to rape
or murder someone

183
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,658
in the next two days,
no matter what.

184
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:06,586
If you try to suppress it,
it's always possible you'll do both

185
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,333
or commit suicide.

186
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:11,040
Just, you know, to have
all the options on the table.

187
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,008
What the hell
am I going to do?

188
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,460
What... What are
we going to do?

189
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,301
- Have you considered Tinder?
- What? No.

190
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,225
Because I have
a really, really bad STD

191
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:24,099
and that sort of kills
the desire to sleep with anyone.

192
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:25,976
- So forget...
- Mmm-hmm.

193
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,273
Wait.

194
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,270
Did you do that?

195
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,482
Yes. And it worked.

196
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:35,732
- That is why I am not going crazy right now.
- Huh.

197
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,735
Oh, you are
very charming, Josh.

198
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,034
I'm sure you'll have
no trouble finding someone

199
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,614
to dance with before,
you know,

200
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,700
the wolf makes
a choice for you.

201
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,035
Good luck, Josh.

202
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,751
PLOVER: The Librarians don't know
I've been living here.

203
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,462
Apologies for the mess.

204
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:02,432
Oh, and, uh, for how
I brought you here.

205
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,181
I didn't mean
to be rough.

206
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,934
I just wanted to get you out of sight
before you got caught.

207
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,142
You do remember me,
don't you? I'm Christopher...

208
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:12,477
Plover.

209
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,859
You're the child molester
who's directly responsible

210
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,982
for Martin Chatwin
becoming The Beast.

211
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:22,533
I also wrote some
very popular books.

212
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:24,280
How did you
end up here anyway?

213
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:26,912
Oh, that's a long
and boring story.

214
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,117
(SIGHS)

215
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:30,703
The important thing is
we can help each other.

216
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,126
- See, I need an extra pair of hands.
- No.

217
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:38,636
And yet I know very well
that you could use my help.

218
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:41,464
You're trying to escape
The Order, aren't you?

219
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:42,924
From the looks of it,
we both are.

220
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:48,054
You didn't leave with Santa Claus.
Why not?

221
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:52,308
- I get sleigh-sick.
- You can say what you want.

222
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:55,607
But I know the real reason...
Oh, please don't touch that. Please.

223
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:58,235
The real reason
you stayed behind.

224
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:03,239
You were looking for your book,
yours and your friends'.

225
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:05,783
Do you have them?

226
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,740
The books are
in the Revision Room.

227
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,410
But I happen to know
where that is.

228
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:15,839
So you help me with my little something,
and I'll take you there.

229
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,211
Deal?

230
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:25,592
LAURA: I don't know why your father
made so many of them.

231
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,768
- He liked planes.
- (CHUCKLES)

232
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,847
A creative outlet.

233
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:35,852
He's dead, Mom.
We can stop criticizing him.

234
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,404
I didn't want to be here at all, you know,
but there was no one else.

235
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,656
Molly is furious.

236
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,405
You know how
she felt about Ted.

237
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,161
I know, I'm sorry, I...

238
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:51,326
- I was traveling and my phone died and I...
- (SCOFFS)

239
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,293
You're the only
millennial I know

240
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,166
who isn't buried
in his phone 24/7.

241
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,963
Are we going
to do this again?

242
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,293
(SIGHING)

243
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,421
What was wrong with him, huh?

244
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,551
People make friends.
That's normal.

245
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:12,222
He was normal.
I divorced him, he was so normal,

246
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,186
so where are
his goddamn friends?

247
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,525
There was no one
at the funeral.

248
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,437
I don't know.

249
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:21,981
Did he ever date?

250
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,691
Never mind.
I don't want to know.

251
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:30,456
Okay, so we pack
these boxes.

252
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:33,079
Yeah, unless you want
to keep all this junk.

253
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,147
I found a guy upstate.
He'll take them off your hands,

254
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,584
but you have to
get it done by tomorrow.

255
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:44,838
- I... I got it.
- Okay, just, um, be careful.

256
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,054
Don't break anything.

257
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,854
Christ on a goddamn
communion wafer.

258
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,104
It's like I'm caught in a real-life game
of marry-fuck-kill,

259
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,775
only "marry"
is off the table.

260
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:02,988
- What are you gonna do about it?
- I have no goddamn clue.

261
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:05,010
Why do you think I'm sitting
here with my head in my hands,

262
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:07,401
the traditional
Hoberman despair position?

263
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:10,283
Okay, then
here's a plan.

264
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,288
We're going to
fix this bullshit.

265
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,412
I don't want to add
to your problems, Margo.

266
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,062
So 'cause of that,
you're gonna sit back

267
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,877
and just let this shit
happen to you?

268
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,375
Huh?

269
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,548
This ain't prom night,

270
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,750
and the only thing
I know for sure

271
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:26,633
is you're not going to fix anything
if you nutsack out on me.

272
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:29,261
I won't nutsack out.

273
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,558
Good. That's what
I want to hear.

274
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,012
Because we are going to find
a way out of this thing,

275
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,606
or we're gonna die trying.

276
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,310
(SIGHING)

277
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:48,053
I'm starting to see why no one's ever
beaten this curse. It's like herpes.

278
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,241
Cockroach-in-a-nuclear-war-level
impossible to stomp out.

279
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:55,291
Well, I found some shit on a ritual
from an Indonesian tribe.

280
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:58,665
It's supposed to prevent
supernatural transformations.

281
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:02,001
Or maybe cause them.
My Indonesian sucks.

(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

283
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:05,884
Uber alert.

00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,008
You know, these surge prices
are really getting out of...

285
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:12,091
Oh, no. Oh, no,
no, no, no, no.

286
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:15,019
Okay, surge prices piss me off, too,
but are you all right?

287
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:18,101
I've always been upfront
about my L-positive status

288
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,480
with any potential partners
before anything happens.

289
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:24,649
- What's that have to do with Uber?
- Isaac wasn't.

290
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,400
Oh.

291
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:29,108
So how many people
did Isaac do doggy-style?

292
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,570
Just one, and I'm going
to go warn her now.

293
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,331
Uh-huh. Yup! What a Monday!

294
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:40,711
So this book
is used to help me locate

295
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,629
different worlds via
a cooperative spell?

296
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,707
It is called
<i>The World Book.</i>

297
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:48,010
Yes, I can read.
So it's like the encyclopedia.

298
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,255
- More like an atlas.
- What world are you looking for?

299
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:54,933
One where I can be happy,
where I can belong.

300
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:59,805
(SIGHING) No, it's not what you think.
I'm not interested in that.

301
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,391
I just want to go somewhere
where I can do no harm.

302
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,064
I'll never do that again.
I swear on my life.

303
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,567
Yeah, well, I don't know
if I believe you.

304
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,112
I spent years
being tortured by Martin,

305
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,031
plenty of time
to think on my actions

306
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,450
and regret them.

307
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:21,745
Did you never unintentionally
hurt someone you love, Alice?

308
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:25,664
I never molested a child.

309
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,800
But, yes, I've done
things I regret.

310
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,712
- Don't you deserve happiness?
- No.

311
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:35,633
Oh, come on, don't be so hard on yourself.
We all deserve it.

312
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,638
I don't think you do.

313
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:40,888
I don't particularly
care what you think.

314
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,855
You need my help finding
the Revision Room.

315
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,558
So either you help me
with this spell,

316
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,439
or you're on your own.

- Hi, uh, I'm Josh.

00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,366
I'm Isaac's friend.

00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,656
Isaac.

321
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,363
He hooked up with you
that one time.

322
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,494
Oh.

323
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,626
Right.

324
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:05,246
Look, it's a really
bad time right now.

325
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,651
Oh, uh, no, Isaac really wanted me
to talk to you about something,

326
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:11,294
and it's kind of an emergency.
So can I come in, please?

327
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:13,879
How do you
know Isaac again?

328
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,555
Oh, uh...

329
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,884
He and I met
at Jewish camp.

330
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:22,100
This is kind of weird.
I mean, why did he send a friend

331
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,500
instead of, like,
calling me himself?

332
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:27,814
- He's got, uh, laryngitis.
- So he can't text?

333
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,608
And he broke
all of his fingers.

334
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:35,117
Anyhoo, I've got to talk to you
about Isaac's problem,

335
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:39,534
which he's embarrassed because
he came down with something,

336
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,499
and he's afraid that you might have
caught it from him.

337
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:46,291
- Caught what?
- Oh, just a

338
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,129
herpes-like thing.

339
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:51,295
- He gave me herpes?
- I believe I said "herpes-like."

340
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:52,838
Well, what the hell is it?

341
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:54,448
The only way to know
if you got it is to sort of

342
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,658
go through the symptoms and see
if you've been experiencing them.

343
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:59,390
Okay, Josh
from Jewish camp,

344
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:01,560
I'm going to discuss
genital warts

345
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:05,014
and discharge with you
'cause we just met.

346
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,849
Jesus Christ. Fuck my life!

347
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:11,688
Look, have you maybe not been
feeling yourself lately?

348
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:14,524
Not really. And I'm
beginning to wonder

349
00:17:14,617 --> 00:17:16,057
why I let you in,
in the first place.

350
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:19,532
Great, and, uh, have you
maybe been having dreams

351
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:21,909
that are weird and violent?

352
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,209
Maybe.

353
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,786
Right, well, this last one
might sound a little crazy,

354
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,841
but have you maybe been unable
to control yourself around guys?

355
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:34,672
Get out of my apartment.

356
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,114
Oh, wait. No, no, no.
This wasn't me

357
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,491
- trying to freak you out.
- Seriously, get out!

358
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:42,351
Okay, please, just let me help you.
I just want to help.

359
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,723
(VOICE BREAKING) It's been a really
hard couple of days.

360
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:52,102
I've been totally freaking,
like...

361
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,649
- What's wrong with me?
- I know what you mean,

362
00:17:56,742 --> 00:18:00,326
and it's completely normal,

363
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:03,781
and I assure you,
this is not your fault.

364
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:08,414
That's so good to hear.
I mean,

365
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:13,169
how could I even do that
to someone else?

366
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,752
It's a total mess in there.
(CHUCKLING)

367
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,672
- Uh, a mess? Uh, where?
- Mmm-hmm.

368
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,392
(GASPS)

369
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,781
- Jesus tits.
- It's not that bad, is it?

370
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:44,743
JULIA: Is it possible for an entire forest
to do the walk of shame?

371
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:48,872
PENNY 23: Seriously, nature is not
supposed to be this sticky.

372
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,244
- (DOG BARKING)
- Uh-oh.

373
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,415
You think she's
who we're looking for?

374
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:57,380
- Whoa, whoa! Wait, wait! Don't!
- Why not?

375
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,553
Because you have
something to live for?

376
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,848
I'm a Maenad.
The god that I'm here to serve is dead.

377
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,513
I literally have
nothing to live for.

378
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:08,812
But thanks, thanks for the less
than basic understanding

379
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,396
of my life's purpose.

380
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:13,692
No, no, no! Wait! Don't, please.
We need your help.

381
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,069
Shoshana.

382
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,772
Shoshana.
We need your help, Shoshana.

383
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,782
Hmm?

384
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,948
Peach Schnapps.
(CRYING)

385
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,832
Bacchus left that
for the talking bears to find.

386
00:19:28,918 --> 00:19:31,626
Okay, so how
about a toast?

387
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,704
Right? Ba... Bacchus would've
wanted us to drink.

388
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:36,005
God, like, so much. Yeah.

389
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:38,254
Okay, so to Bacchus.

390
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,220
To Bacchus.

391
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:46,217
- Oh, God, it smells like pee sangria.
- I don't give a shit. Drink it.

392
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,178
- To, uh, Bacchus!
- Bacchus.

393
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,682
- (SOBBING)
- JULIA: Whoo!

394
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,271
Oh, that's good shit.
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

395
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:03,196
Um, I was a goddess
and I gave away my power,

396
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:07,245
and now I can't use magic.
Only I'm indestructible.

397
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:11,416
So maybe you can help me
understand what is going on.

398
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,127
You were a goddess?

399
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:16,713
Yeah.

400
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:19,545
(SIGHING)

401
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:20,876
If all these other Maenads

402
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:23,428
hadn't run through the poison
wine like a bunch of bitches,

403
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:25,722
I wouldn't even
be in this situation!

404
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:28,551
Well, maybe if you help us,
we can...

405
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,680
(INHALING SHARPLY)

406
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,978
(HOWLING)

407
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,150
- (SHOSHANA SHRIEKING)
- Oh...

408
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:43,736
- I'm sorry. What are you... What are you doing?
- (PANTING)

409
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,567
I'm trying to read your aura.

410
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,072
(ULULATING)

411
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,119
Maybe we can just
get the pine cone out of my face?

412
00:20:57,548 --> 00:21:00,416
- Okay.
- That's what I thought.

413
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,171
Inconclusive.

414
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,720
I do know a ritual that could
help diagnose you further.

415
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,590
But, um, it's pretty intimate.

416
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,972
Um, okay.
I can live with that.

417
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,475
Yeah, the only thing is
I... I can't perform it.

418
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:16,773
Uh, why not?

419
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:18,225
Well, I don't believe in you.

420
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:19,651
I can help interpret,

421
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:22,775
but you need someone
who believes in you,

422
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,233
okay, who worships you,

423
00:21:26,327 --> 00:21:28,114
body and soul,

424
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:30,696
to perform the ritual.

425
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,244
Anyone come to mind?

426
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:42,750
Fine, I'll help.

427
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,969
Jesus R.R. Christ.

428
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,177
An innocent girl is a murderer

429
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,554
'cause I couldn't
get to her in time.

430
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:55,809
Oh, put your tit back
in your training bra, wolf boy.

431
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,849
We don't really know
how innocent this girl was.

432
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:00,184
Sleeping with
her Uber driver

433
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,815
sounds like she had
a death wish to begin with.

434
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:04,646
- You're not helping.
- Drink.

435
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,447
- Is this a potion?
- It's alcohol.

436
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:08,116
Good enough.

437
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:10,364
While you were busy with
your domestic issues,

438
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:13,117
I managed to translate
this Indonesian ritual,

439
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:15,449
and good news is
this is first-year Brakebills

440
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:17,535
multi-culti elective crap.

441
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:20,211
So we can definitely pull it off
without breaking the magic bank.

442
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:24,917
Only prob is finding
one exotic ingredient.

443
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:29,797
Uh, what type of exotic
are we talking about here?

444
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:33,641
We need a living Komodo dragon
so we can cut out its heart,

445
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,686
and I heard a rumor Kanye keeps one
in his New York apartment.

446
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,310
- That sounds on-brand.
- Let's go.

447
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,686
(SIGHING)

448
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,902
Uh, wait. I have to
give you something.

449
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:48,281
It's loaded
with silver bullets.

450
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:52,361
The Quickening has started
to do weird things to me and...

451
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,822
Well, if I wolf-out,

452
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,372
you might need to stop me.

453
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,082
It's not gonna come to that.

454
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:04,464
I promise.

455
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:09,135
Now come on.
Let's go steal Kanye's lizard.

456
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:41,418
(WHISPERING) As you can see,
rather hard to get in unseen.

457
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,460
Not if you can bend light.

458
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:46,130
Regardless, stealing
the books isn't really

459
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,582
the biggest issue,
is it?

460
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:50,732
If the Library discovers they're gone,
they're gonna come after you.

461
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,073
Yeah, but if they
read my book,

462
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,713
they'll know exactly
where I'll be.

463
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:57,600
Yes, but what if
they read your book

464
00:23:57,686 --> 00:23:59,803
and still had no idea
where you were?

465
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,393
What are you proposing?

466
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:08,149
When I was writing <i>The Wandering Dune,</i>
I was also studying magic.

467
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,396
Now, I kept
blowing deadlines

468
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:13,700
until I found a spell
for automatic writing.

469
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:17,746
Now, you feed it a premise
and it constructs an airtight storyline.

470
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:20,323
I gather they use it in
Hollywood all the time.

471
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,541
That explains Netflix.

472
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:25,332
How does this spell work?

473
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,255
Why, we steal the manuscripts,
pull the endings,

474
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:29,986
cast a spell on them,
and then replace them

475
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,297
just before they take them away
to bind them as books.

476
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:34,300
<i>Voilà</i>. Oh, you'll be
very surprised

477
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,847
how your stories turn out.

478
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,094
Let me guess.

479
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:39,904
You'll show me how to do the spell
if I help you with the <i>World Book?</i>

480
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:42,016
Well, that only
seems fair, doesn't it?

481
00:24:43,232 --> 00:24:46,851
Look, do you want
my help or not?

482
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,316
(DOOR CLOSES)

483
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,619
Mom, I told you I'd have this
done by tomorrow, so just...

484
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:00,538
Jesus.

485
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:02,703
Hello?

486
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:05,710
I found these in your
dead father's fridge.

487
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:09,248
They're not quite what
I'd hoped they'd be.

488
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,590
You finished
with the killing yet?

489
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:13,043
With the, uh...

490
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:14,137
What?

491
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:17,714
Your father's dead. I thought, perhaps,
you'd get angry and kill things.

492
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:18,808
That's what I'd do.

493
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:21,434
It's not really
what people do.

494
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:23,603
Nowadays, anyway.

495
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:26,727
You're not going
to kill anything?

496
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:28,392
Interesting.

497
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:30,272
(EXHALING DEEPLY)

498
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:32,980
Frozen peas?

499
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,780
Nope. No, thanks.

500
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:38,155
Let's go, then.

501
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,827
I'm bored of this food.

502
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:42,496
Can I just have
a few minutes to finish this?

503
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,581
This is important to you?

504
00:25:49,715 --> 00:25:51,502
Yeah, it is.

505
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,258
This is a very
interesting game,

506
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:57,007
the loving
your dead dad game.

507
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,349
I don't understand it.

508
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,476
It's not a game. It...

509
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:08,727
There must be someone

686
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:29,261
- No. I don't. I... I can't do magic.
- Those aren't the same.

687
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:31,804
Oh, this,

688
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:35,228
this is real weird.
(GASPING)

689
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:39,896
You weren't bullshitting me

690
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:41,855
when you said you were
a goddess, were you?

691
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:46,536
No, but how... How can I be a goddess
if I don't have any power?

692
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,954
Maybe you think
you don't, but...

693
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:54,039
I have never seen anything
like this before.

694
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,667
So we're good now?

695
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:00,500
You're not gonna
kill yourself?

696
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,129
No, I can't now.

697
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,132
I have a new deity to follow.

698
00:37:07,392 --> 00:37:08,392
Oh, boy.

699
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,226
I think
you're overreacting.

700
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,820
I could've sexually assaulted
you or ate you.

701
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,551
I don't honestly know how
things would've turned out.

702
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,817
It's no reason to give up.
There's got to be a solution.

703
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:28,618
I've got, what, a couple hours
before The Quickening takes over,

704
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:31,038
and I'm sorry if that makes me
a wimp or whatever,

705
00:37:31,124 --> 00:37:32,865
but I don't want to rape
or murder anyone.

706
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,040
Oh, come on.

707
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:36,919
There are plenty of people
who deserve to be killed.

708
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:39,664
I can think of a half dozen
at Brakebills alone.

709
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,318
If you can just keep
your twat together,

710
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:44,176
I'm sure I can get at least
one of them down here.

711
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,128
I mean,
Todd totally owes me.

712
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:49,508
- He doesn't owe you his life.
- Doesn't he?

713
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,103
I can't do it, Margo.

714
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:55,771
Well, you can't do nothing,

715
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:57,519
because you'll die
in this cage.

716
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,020
At least I can live with that.

717
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:01,777
I mean, not live exactly,

718
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:03,445
but you...
You get what I'm saying.

719
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:04,863
This is bullshit.

720
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,865
You're just throwing
your life away.

721
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,593
I was thinking more
like noble sacrifice.

722
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,493
Screw your noble sacrifice!

723
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:14,498
What is it with you boys
and your noble sacrifice?

724
00:38:14,584 --> 00:38:15,950
I'm not gonna let you do it.

725
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:17,160
Well, it's not your choice.

726
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,661
You can't fix me, okay?

727
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:19,962
Some things are just broken,

728
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,192
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

729
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:22,832
Said the quitter
right before he quit.

730
00:38:22,926 --> 00:38:25,794
You think I want to die?
Of course I fucking don't!

731
00:38:25,887 --> 00:38:28,324
But... But I don't see a way out of this,
and frankly you not giving up

732
00:38:28,348 --> 00:38:29,708
is making what
I have to do harder.

733
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:36,395
You want to do
something stupid?

734
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:44,232
Fine by me.

735
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,442
What the hell are you doing?

736
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:47,739
Something stupider.

737
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:53,537
This isn't a joke, Margo. I... I'm not
going to be able to control myself.

738
00:38:53,623 --> 00:38:55,660
I might kill you or...

739
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,991
- Or...
- Or what?

740
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,627
Fuck me?

741
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,585
Margo.

742
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:08,177
This curse isn't curable.

743
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,212
I don't want you
to go through this.

744
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:11,888
- The... The Quickening is...
- Why not?

745
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:12,975
Because...

746
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,304
I like you.

747
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:17,686
I like you, too.

748
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:23,192
And I'm not gonna lose
another friend today, okay?

749
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,489
I can't make you
kill someone,

750
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,113
but I can consent.

751
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:41,122
Damn.

752
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,249
The Quickening makes you
a really good kisser.

753
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,705
I know.

754
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:54,466
That was more cathartic
than I thought it would be.

755
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:57,222
It was kind of fun,
wasn't it?

756
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:04,892
It feels good after you deal
with death, doesn't it?

757
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:07,235
A little.

758
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:08,563
Still hurts,

759
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,691
but eventually it hurts
a little less.

760
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:12,784
Uh-huh.

761
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:18,580
I'm going to need your help
to search for more gods.

762
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:21,534
You'll be more useful to me
if you feel better,

763
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:26,339
so you should know that
your friend Eliot is dead.

764
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:33,132
You can smash
more things if you want.

765
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:35,635
And then we'll go
get something to eat.

766
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:38,225
Sound good?

767
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,730
I cannot believe
you just did that.

768
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:50,905
I rocked your world.
Get over it.

769
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,529
Oh, no, you...
That was great.

770
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:58,078
It's just you can't
have sex now with anyone

771
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:01,953
who isn't L-positive
without infecting them.

772
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,784
You know, so...

773
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:06,499
Since when is
P-in-the-V sex

774
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:09,457
the pinnacle of what one
or two or three or five

775
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,337
or an animal can do together?

776
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:14,174
I mean, it's not even
on my top 10.

777
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,504
(CHUCKLES)

778
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:17,715
I guess I see
your point there.

779
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,224
All the same,

780
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,018
what are you gonna do
about The Quickening?

781
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:23,687
How... How are you
gonna handle that?

782
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:25,890
In what, 30 years?

783
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,475
No way I'm gonna
live that long.

784
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,355
And if I do,
Todd totally owes me.

785
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,319
You're joking, right?

786
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:32,980
You're joking.

787
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,493
(LAUGHS)

788
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,824
So what is this? This is...

789
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,031
(STAMMERS) This is
just casual, right?

790
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:44,833
We're not...
You know?

791
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:48,246
I saved your
fucking life, bitch.

792
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,339
(SCOFFS)

793
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:51,749
Casual that.

794
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:55,503
Thanks, Margo.

795
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,216
I'm sorry we couldn't

796
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:02,141
figure out a way to help,

797
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:03,514
you know...

798
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:07,769
I am, too.

799
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,936
I would have done
anything to save him.

800
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:19,405
But I think he might
actually be gone.

801
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,495
THE MONSTER: <i>I felt the moment
his soul died.</i>

802
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,088
It only hurt
for a second.

803
00:42:31,174 --> 00:42:35,384
I promise he didn't suffer.

804
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:37,799
(LAUGHS)

805
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,926
You'll come around.

806
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,556
I know it.

807
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:50,812
MAN: (SINGING)
<i>Let's take it right back</i>

808
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,484
ELIOT: (YELLING) <i>Hello?</i>

809
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:57,064
<i>But we never look back</i>

810
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:59,525
<i>No, we only look forward</i>

811
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:03,579
<i>To all the new pain</i>

812
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:06,532
<i>And violence that we blame</i>

813
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:08,367
<i>No, we never look back</i>

814
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,954
<i>No, we only look forward</i>

815
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,542
Hello?

816
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:14,919
<i>With all our fate</i>

817
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:18,298
<i>Hearts broken from the start</i>

818
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,346
(YELLS) Is anybody there?

819
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:24,178
Margo!

820
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:28,308
<i>Only to be held tall</i>

821
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:31,390
<i>By the writing on the wall</i>

822
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:35,478
<i>We don't need
no premonitions, no</i>

823
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:43,990
<i>Let's take it right back</i>

824
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,948
<i>To where it all began</i>

825
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:50,000
<i>But we never look back</i>

826
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:52,328
<i>No, we only look forward</i>

827
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:55,960
<i>To all the new shame</i>

828
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,588
<i>And waste of what we gain</i>
