1
00:00:07,023 --> 00:00:08,343
- Previously on
"The Magicians"...

2
00:00:09,133 --> 00:00:10,253
"The following books
have been removed

3
00:00:10,253 --> 00:00:12,103
from circulation for revisions."

4
00:00:12,103 --> 00:00:13,993
They're filling in the
endings of our books.

5
00:00:13,993 --> 00:00:15,093
- I'm sorry about your
friend's books, but...

6
00:00:15,093 --> 00:00:17,983
- Just go while you
still have the chance.

7
00:00:18,923 --> 00:00:21,963
- Technically,
I have sexually transmitted lycanthropy.

8
00:00:21,963 --> 00:00:24,033
The other Josh told
me something terrible

9
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:25,983
was going to happen to him.

10
00:00:25,983 --> 00:00:27,943
- It was called the Quickening.
- It's going to happen to me too.

11
00:00:27,943 --> 00:00:29,123
- I'm a full-on goddess.

12
00:00:31,953 --> 00:00:33,123
I'm not connected
to anything anymore.

13
00:00:33,123 --> 00:00:36,123
- My dad and I used to
build model airplanes.

14
00:00:36,123 --> 00:00:39,943
Get your hands on this and
you ended up in 20 pieces.

15
00:00:39,943 --> 00:00:42,113
Magic's gone.
I went into remission a week later.

16
00:00:42,113 --> 00:00:44,953
- You turned your back on
what happens to your dad.

17
00:00:44,953 --> 00:00:47,053
- It's a voicemail from my mom.

18
00:00:47,053 --> 00:00:49,093
Let me sit here for a minute.

19
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:53,983
- I know Bacchus.
- He's a friend.

20
00:00:53,983 --> 00:00:55,023
- Then you'll poison him.

21
00:00:55,023 --> 00:00:56,113
- You know what's incredible?

22
00:00:56,113 --> 00:00:58,043
How you can be
such a good friend

23
00:00:58,043 --> 00:00:59,973
and such a terrible friend
at the exact same time.

24
00:00:59,973 --> 00:01:02,083
- Gods are so tricky.

25
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:06,973
They took this part of
me that knew things.

26
00:01:11,033 --> 00:01:12,943
- How long has he been there?

27
00:01:12,943 --> 00:01:15,093
- Since we got
back from Fillory.

28
00:01:15,093 --> 00:01:16,953
- He brought you back?

29
00:01:16,953 --> 00:01:18,093
- I was as surprised as you.

30
00:01:20,053 --> 00:01:23,093
- Meanwhile, you are baking.

31
00:01:23,093 --> 00:01:26,033
- Condolence muffins.

32
00:01:26,033 --> 00:01:28,093
For Quentin?

33
00:01:28,093 --> 00:01:30,063
His dad just passed away.

34
00:01:30,063 --> 00:01:31,563
- And a bullshit yuppie pastry

35
00:01:31,564 --> 00:01:33,063
is gonna help him with that?

36
00:01:33,063 --> 00:01:35,983
A muffin is not a pastry.
It's a quickbread.

37
00:01:35,983 --> 00:01:37,123
- What the hell
is wrong with you?

38
00:01:37,123 --> 00:01:39,013
- I had to help the Monster
murder a friend of mine

39
00:01:39,013 --> 00:01:41,133
and I'm not happy about it.

40
00:01:43,033 --> 00:01:44,153
- From the looks of
it, neither is he.

41
00:01:44,153 --> 00:01:45,953
- Well,
I don't get why he's depressed.

42
00:01:45,953 --> 00:01:48,033
He got what he wanted.

43
00:01:48,033 --> 00:01:51,003
- Where's Darth Eliot?

44
00:01:55,063 --> 00:01:57,093
- She's gonna get us all killed.

45
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:09,023
- I have examined this
over and over again,

46
00:02:09,023 --> 00:02:11,993
and it still won't
reveal itself to me.

47
00:02:11,993 --> 00:02:14,093
Why can't I remember anything?

48
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:15,128
- I don't know.

49
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:16,163
Total drag, I get ya.

50
00:02:16,163 --> 00:02:19,083
But that's kind of what goes
along with a human body.

51
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:22,163
Aches, pain,
can't remember shit.

52
00:02:22,163 --> 00:02:24,153
And since you're done
with your whole deal,

53
00:02:24,153 --> 00:02:28,103
- I was thinking...
- What deal are you talking about?

54
00:02:28,103 --> 00:02:30,103
- We led you to Bacchus.

55
00:02:30,103 --> 00:02:32,133
You killed him.

56
00:02:32,133 --> 00:02:35,523
- So now that we're done-sies...
- Don't speak to me

57
00:02:35,524 --> 00:02:37,063
of done-sies.

58
00:02:37,063 --> 00:02:38,963
Only Bacchus is done-sies.

59
00:02:38,963 --> 00:02:42,093
- I'm just saying you
got your vengeance.

60
00:02:42,093 --> 00:02:44,183
Might wanna try another body.

61
00:02:44,183 --> 00:02:46,983
Maybe a non-human one.

62
00:02:47,983 --> 00:02:50,193
I don't know.

63
00:02:50,193 --> 00:02:52,163
See if it helps with the
whole remembering thing.

64
00:02:52,163 --> 00:02:53,983
- I'm good.

65
00:02:56,063 --> 00:02:58,193
- Fuck.

66
00:03:07,033 --> 00:03:10,073
- You look like you could
use a big ball of carbs.

67
00:03:15,093 --> 00:03:17,098
- Jesus' tits!

68
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:19,103
This is a good ball of carbs.

69
00:03:20,063 --> 00:03:21,973
I thought you were pissed at me.

70
00:03:21,973 --> 00:03:25,063
- Oh, I'm not gonna pretend
I'm happy about Bacchus,

71
00:03:25,063 --> 00:03:29,133
but I'm still sorry about Eliot.

72
00:03:42,093 --> 00:03:45,023
- Josh?

73
00:03:45,023 --> 00:03:46,983
Are you okay?

74
00:04:02,063 --> 00:04:04,023
Oh.

75
00:04:36,013 --> 00:04:38,093
- You want me to come?

76
00:04:38,093 --> 00:04:40,023
- I'm gonna miss the funeral.

77
00:04:40,023 --> 00:04:41,183
I missed everything
leading up to it.

78
00:04:41,183 --> 00:04:43,138
There's nothing you can say

79
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:45,093
to my mom that'll change that.

80
00:04:45,093 --> 00:04:47,153
- Well, I could say that
it's not your fault.

81
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:50,913
- The way she sees
it, she's the grown-up

82
00:04:50,913 --> 00:04:52,968
and I'm still making the same

83
00:04:52,969 --> 00:04:55,023
kid mistakes I always did.

84
00:04:55,023 --> 00:04:56,038
- You break things.

85
00:04:56,039 --> 00:04:57,053
- I break things.

86
00:04:57,053 --> 00:05:00,033
Parents are the worst.

87
00:05:01,143 --> 00:05:03,093
- What about you?

88
00:05:03,093 --> 00:05:05,033
- Oh, you know.

89
00:05:05,033 --> 00:05:06,983
Gonna look through
all the stolen books

90
00:05:06,983 --> 00:05:08,143
Marina has stashed around.

91
00:05:08,143 --> 00:05:10,983
See if I could find out
why I'm indestructible

92
00:05:10,983 --> 00:05:12,133
yet can't do magic.

93
00:05:12,133 --> 00:05:13,983
What about Penny?

94
00:05:13,983 --> 00:05:16,913
He still, uh, sweating you?

95
00:05:16,913 --> 00:05:19,073
- He's not sweating me.
- Oh, right.

96
00:05:19,073 --> 00:05:22,103
He's just following you around
with that "I'm totally into you

97
00:05:22,103 --> 00:05:24,033
but I'm not gonna say
anything about it" vibe.

98
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:26,173
- Quentin!
- What? I'm just saying.

99
00:05:26,173 --> 00:05:30,913
Maybe he could help
you with the research.

100
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:33,163
- You're a dick.
- I am a dick.

101
00:05:47,093 --> 00:05:51,033
Hey, uh, Penny 23!
Look at that.

102
00:05:51,033 --> 00:05:53,093
- That sounded real natural.

103
00:05:53,093 --> 00:05:54,173
Why are you skittish as fuck?

104
00:05:54,173 --> 00:05:56,063
- Am I? That's... no.

105
00:05:56,063 --> 00:05:57,083
- What's in the bag?

106
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,153
- Oh, nothing.

107
00:05:59,153 --> 00:06:01,033
- You got blood on your face.
- What?

108
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:02,913
- Yeah, look in the mirror.

109
00:06:02,913 --> 00:06:04,093
- Oh, ah, no-no-no-no-no!
- Don't!

110
00:06:04,093 --> 00:06:05,913
It's not what it looks like!

111
00:06:05,913 --> 00:06:08,113
- Oh!
- It looks like a dead animal.

112
00:06:08,113 --> 00:06:10,913
- Okay,
maybe it is what it looks like.

113
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:12,163
- Is this 'cause
of the Quickening?

114
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:14,073
- I don't know.
- Well, it's something.

115
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:16,033
- Look, I don't know what to do.

116
00:06:16,033 --> 00:06:17,163
- Well, I was pretty damn clear
- about one thing, wasn't I?

117
00:06:17,163 --> 00:06:19,973
You stay away from... - Hey.

118
00:06:19,974 --> 00:06:21,023
- Julia! Hey!

119
00:06:21,023 --> 00:06:22,933
- Hey, did Marina stash
any books in here?

120
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:24,163
- What?

121
00:06:24,163 --> 00:06:26,103
- Uh, books? No, I... I think in the...
- The other room?

122
00:06:26,103 --> 00:06:28,923
Yeah, just not in the
subject I'm looking for.

123
00:06:28,923 --> 00:06:30,163
About God problems.

124
00:06:30,163 --> 00:06:32,103
You know, like where did they go

125
00:06:32,103 --> 00:06:34,113
for magical medical advice?

126
00:06:34,113 --> 00:06:36,203
- Well, why... why don't I help you
look, you know?

127
00:06:36,203 --> 00:06:38,913
- Uh, what about the Maenads?

128
00:06:38,913 --> 00:06:40,033
- The... the Maenads?

129
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:42,033
- The, uh, followers of Bacchus.

130
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:45,153
They're kind of high
priestess/nurses of the Gods.

131
00:06:45,153 --> 00:06:47,063
They were always
at Bacchus' parties

132
00:06:47,063 --> 00:06:49,923
and when he would get too
wrecked, which was always,

133
00:06:49,923 --> 00:06:52,953
they pulled him out and gave
him a divine B12 shot or...

134
00:06:52,953 --> 00:06:55,033
- Wait, wait,
so the Monster killed Bacchus

135
00:06:55,033 --> 00:06:57,033
but didn't touch the Maenads?

136
00:06:57,033 --> 00:06:59,183
- Well, they're probably
still in Fillory.

137
00:06:59,183 --> 00:07:00,183
They were pretty
attached to him.

138
00:07:00,183 --> 00:07:02,173
- Oh, I... I can take you.

139
00:07:02,173 --> 00:07:04,203
- Yeah, that'd be great.

140
00:07:04,203 --> 00:07:05,953
Uh, thanks, Josh.

141
00:07:05,953 --> 00:07:07,203
- Yeah!

142
00:07:07,203 --> 00:07:08,658
- You get this Quickening

143
00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:10,113
bullshit figured out right now.

144
00:07:10,113 --> 00:07:13,053
Okay.

145
00:07:18,163 --> 00:07:19,443
- I didn't think I passed it on.

146
00:07:20,113 --> 00:07:22,033
You never said anything.

147
00:07:22,033 --> 00:07:23,103
- Oh, I'm sorry.

148
00:07:23,103 --> 00:07:26,073
Were you waiting
for me to tell you?

149
00:07:26,073 --> 00:07:28,163
- You never disclosed your status
- to me in the first place.

150
00:07:28,163 --> 00:07:31,073
- Because you were
so understanding,

151
00:07:31,073 --> 00:07:33,143
I thought you knew.

152
00:07:33,143 --> 00:07:35,163
Uh, it was a little bit
of a low point for me,

153
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,023
that night.

154
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:39,043
- Oh, well, great to hear.

155
00:07:39,043 --> 00:07:41,033
- I don't mean you!

156
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:43,113
I was going through
a bad divorce.

157
00:07:43,113 --> 00:07:45,913
You're the first person
who really seemed to get

158
00:07:45,913 --> 00:07:47,913
what I was going through.

159
00:07:47,913 --> 00:07:51,103
- Fine, whatever.
- Look... look, I... I just need your help.

160
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:52,618
What is going on with me?

161
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:54,133
With us?

162
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:55,913
The Quickening?

163
00:07:55,913 --> 00:07:58,173
- Well,
I don't really know everything.

164
00:07:58,173 --> 00:08:01,033
- You're a goddamn
Cryptozoology professor.

165
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:02,093
What do you know?

166
00:08:02,093 --> 00:08:05,103
- Lycanthropy is
technically a curse.

167
00:08:05,103 --> 00:08:08,023
Un, transformations are
tied to the lunar cycle

168
00:08:08,023 --> 00:08:12,093
and behavioral changes
are mostly non-lethal...

169
00:08:12,093 --> 00:08:14,053
except during the Quickening.

170
00:08:14,053 --> 00:08:16,163
- Well, that sounds
pretty, pretty bad.

171
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:19,113
Oh, luckily it only happens
every 30 years or so.

172
00:08:19,113 --> 00:08:22,558
In the 48 hours leading
up, all Lycanthropes

173
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:25,913
experience urges starting
in the form of nightmares

174
00:08:25,913 --> 00:08:27,923
or even waking dreams.

175
00:08:27,923 --> 00:08:29,913
- What is the curse
trying to make me do?

176
00:08:29,913 --> 00:08:33,913
- Have traditional sex
with an unaffected person

177
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:35,173
or kill them.

178
00:08:35,173 --> 00:08:37,143
- Jesus K. LeChrist.

179
00:08:37,143 --> 00:08:39,953
- The urges increase as
the moon moves towards

180
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:41,923
its aphelion.

181
00:08:41,923 --> 00:08:44,913
The climax, as it were,
and the lycanthropic high point

182
00:08:44,913 --> 00:08:47,133
of lupinity or wolf-ness.

183
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:49,093
- I took your class, Helen.

184
00:08:49,094 --> 00:08:51,053
I know what lupinity means.

185
00:08:51,053 --> 00:08:54,933
Why can't I just lock
myself up in a cage

186
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:56,163
until the Quickening passes?

187
00:08:56,163 --> 00:08:59,053
- Because that won't
satisfy the urge.

188
00:08:59,053 --> 00:09:00,558
You need to have sex or kill or

189
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:02,063
you'll rip your own guts out.

190
00:09:02,063 --> 00:09:04,133
That's how the curse
is ensured to spread.

191
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:05,983
It's quite clever actually.

192
00:09:05,983 --> 00:09:07,113
- Oh, yeah, real clever.

193
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:08,153
I'm going to rape
or murder someone

194
00:09:08,153 --> 00:09:10,063
in the next two
days no matter what.

195
00:09:10,063 --> 00:09:12,093
- If you try to suppress
it, it's always possible

196
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:14,193
you'll do both or
commit suicide.

197
00:09:14,193 --> 00:09:17,183
Just, you know,
to have all the options on the table.

198
00:09:17,183 --> 00:09:19,163
- What the hell
am I going to do?

199
00:09:19,163 --> 00:09:21,943
What... what are we going to do?

200
00:09:21,943 --> 00:09:23,163
- Have you considered Tinder?

201
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:24,943
- What? No!

202
00:09:24,943 --> 00:09:27,913
Because I have a
really, really bad STD

203
00:09:27,913 --> 00:09:30,163
and that sort of kills the
desire to sleep with anyone.

204
00:09:30,163 --> 00:09:33,183
So forget... wait.

205
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,943
Did you do that?

206
00:09:36,933 --> 00:09:37,993
- Yes.

207
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,053
And it worked.

208
00:09:39,053 --> 00:09:41,163
That is why I am not
going crazy right now.

209
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,943
- Huh.

210
00:09:42,943 --> 00:09:44,983
- Ugh, well,
you are very charming, Josh.

211
00:09:44,983 --> 00:09:48,153
I'm sure you'll have no
trouble finding someone to

212
00:09:48,153 --> 00:09:52,113
dance with before, you know,
the wolf makes a choice for you.

213
00:09:52,113 --> 00:09:53,173
Good luck, Josh.

214
00:09:58,163 --> 00:10:01,993
- The librarians don't
know I've been living here.

215
00:10:01,993 --> 00:10:05,003
Apologies for the mess.

216
00:10:05,003 --> 00:10:09,003
Oh, and, uh,
for how I brought you here.

217
00:10:09,003 --> 00:10:11,003
I... I didn't mean to be rough.

218
00:10:11,003 --> 00:10:12,593
I... I just wanted to get you out

219
00:10:12,594 --> 00:10:14,183
of sight before you got caught.

220
00:10:14,183 --> 00:10:16,173
You do remember me, don't you?

221
00:10:16,173 --> 00:10:19,933
I'm... I'm Christopher... - Plover.

222
00:10:19,933 --> 00:10:22,133
You're the child molester
who's directly responsible

223
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:24,033
for Martin Chatwin
becoming The Beast.

224
00:10:25,193 --> 00:10:29,023
- I also wrote some
very popular books.

225
00:10:29,023 --> 00:10:30,943
- How did you end
up here anyway?

226
00:10:30,943 --> 00:10:33,103
- Oh, that's a
long, boring story.

227
00:10:34,183 --> 00:10:37,023
The important thing is
we can help each other.

228
00:10:37,023 --> 00:10:40,163
See, I need an extra pair of hands.
- No.

229
00:10:40,163 --> 00:10:45,133
- And yet, I know very well
that you could use my help.

230
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:47,993
You're trying to escape The
Order, aren't you?

231
00:10:47,993 --> 00:10:50,033
- From the looks of
it, we both are.

232
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:54,193
You didn't leave with Santa Claus.
Why not?

233
00:10:54,193 --> 00:10:56,943
- I get sleigh-sick.

234
00:10:56,943 --> 00:10:58,963
- You can say what you want.

235
00:10:58,963 --> 00:11:00,913
But I know the real reason...

236
00:11:00,913 --> 00:11:02,143
- Oh, please don't touch that.
- Please.

237
00:11:02,143 --> 00:11:04,193
The real reason
you stayed behind.

238
00:11:05,993 --> 00:11:08,123
You were looking for your book.

239
00:11:08,123 --> 00:11:10,943
Yours and your friend's.

240
00:11:10,943 --> 00:11:12,153
- Do you have them?

241
00:11:12,153 --> 00:11:15,133
- The books are in
the Revision Room.

242
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,123
But I happen to
know where that is.

243
00:11:17,123 --> 00:11:20,153
So you help me with
my little something

244
00:11:20,153 --> 00:11:22,153
and I'll take you there.

245
00:11:22,153 --> 00:11:23,943
Deal?

246
00:11:29,847 --> 00:11:32,747
- I don't know why your
father made so many of them.

247
00:11:32,747 --> 00:11:35,747
- He liked planes.

248
00:11:35,747 --> 00:11:38,667
A creative outlet.

249
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:40,777
- He's dead, Mom.

250
00:11:40,778 --> 00:11:42,887
We can stop criticizing him.

251
00:11:42,887 --> 00:11:44,877
- I didn't want to be here at
all, you know,

252
00:11:44,877 --> 00:11:46,857
but there was no one else.

253
00:11:46,857 --> 00:11:48,767
Molly is furious.

254
00:11:48,767 --> 00:11:51,677
You know how she felt about Ted.

255
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:53,637
- I know, I'm sorry, I...

256
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:58,667
I was traveling and
my phone died and I...

257
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:00,647
- You're the only
millennial I know

258
00:12:00,647 --> 00:12:02,647
who isn't buried
in his phone 24/7.

259
00:12:02,647 --> 00:12:04,627
- Are we going to do this again?

260
00:12:09,867 --> 00:12:11,697
What was wrong with him, huh?

261
00:12:12,677 --> 00:12:13,782
People make friends.

262
00:12:13,783 --> 00:12:14,887
That's normal.

263
00:12:16,717 --> 00:12:17,857
He was normal.

264
00:12:17,857 --> 00:12:19,907
I divorced him,
he was so normal, so...

265
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:22,757
where are his goddamn friends?

266
00:12:22,757 --> 00:12:24,747
There was no one at the funeral.

267
00:12:25,867 --> 00:12:27,857
- I don't know.

268
00:12:27,857 --> 00:12:28,897
- Did he ever date?

269
00:12:28,897 --> 00:12:30,777
- Never mind.
- I don't want to know.

270
00:12:34,677 --> 00:12:37,747
- Okay, so we pack these boxes.

271
00:12:37,747 --> 00:12:40,637
- Yeah, unless you want
to keep all this junk.

272
00:12:40,637 --> 00:12:41,887
- I found a guy upstate.
- He'll take them off your hands,

273
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:44,747
But you have to get
it done by tomorrow.

274
00:12:44,747 --> 00:12:47,647
- I... I got it.

275
00:12:47,647 --> 00:12:52,757
- Okay, just, um... Be careful.

276
00:12:54,877 --> 00:12:57,647
Don't break anything.

277
00:12:57,647 --> 00:13:00,867
- Christ on a goddamn
communion wafer.

278
00:13:00,867 --> 00:13:03,262
- It's like I'm caught
in a real-life game

279
00:13:03,263 --> 00:13:05,887
of Marry-Fuck-Kill,
only "marry" is off the table.

280
00:13:05,887 --> 00:13:07,667
- Well,
what are you gonna do about it?

281
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:09,777
- I have no goddamn clue.

282
00:13:09,777 --> 00:13:11,767
Why do you think I'm sitting

283
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:14,637
- here with my head in my hands, the
traditional Hoberman - despair position?

284
00:13:14,637 --> 00:13:17,747
- Okay, then here's a plan.

285
00:13:17,747 --> 00:13:19,677
We're going to
fix this bullshit.

286
00:13:19,677 --> 00:13:21,717
- I don't want to add
to your problems, Margo.

287
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:22,867
- So 'cause of that,
you're gonna sit back

288
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:24,877
and just let this
shit happen to you?

289
00:13:24,877 --> 00:13:26,727
Huh?

290
00:13:26,727 --> 00:13:29,757
This ain't prom night,
and the only thing I know

291
00:13:29,758 --> 00:13:32,627
for sure is you're not
going to fix anything

292
00:13:32,627 --> 00:13:33,757
if you nutsack out on me.

293
00:13:33,757 --> 00:13:36,677
- I won't nutsack out.

294
00:13:36,677 --> 00:13:38,767
- Good.
- That's what I want to hear.

295
00:13:38,767 --> 00:13:42,727
Because we are going to
find a way out of this thing

296
00:13:42,727 --> 00:13:44,757
or we're gonna die trying.

297
00:13:52,907 --> 00:13:54,627
- I'm starting to see why no

298
00:13:53,757 --> 00:13:54,917
one's ever beaten this curse.

299
00:13:55,747 --> 00:13:57,727
It's like herpes!

300
00:13:57,727 --> 00:13:59,767
- Cockroach-in-a-nuclear-war-
- level impossible to stomp out.

301
00:13:59,767 --> 00:14:01,877
- Well,
I found some shit on a ritual

302
00:14:01,877 --> 00:14:03,797
from an Indonesian tribe.

303
00:14:03,797 --> 00:14:06,877
It's supposed to prevent
supernatural transformations.

304
00:14:07,887 --> 00:14:09,307
Or maybe cause them.

305
00:14:09,308 --> 00:14:10,727
My Indonesian sucks.

306
00:14:12,817 --> 00:14:14,747
- Uber alert.

307
00:14:14,747 --> 00:14:17,707
You know, these surge prices

308
00:14:17,707 --> 00:14:19,217
are really getting out of...
Oh, no.

309
00:14:19,218 --> 00:14:20,727
Oh, no-no-no-no-no.

310
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:22,707
- Okay, surge prices piss me
off, too,

311
00:14:22,707 --> 00:14:23,877
but are you all right?

312
00:14:23,877 --> 00:14:26,677
- I've always been upfront
about my L-positive status

313
00:14:26,677 --> 00:14:29,797
with any potential partners
before anything happens.

314
00:14:29,797 --> 00:14:31,757
- What's that have
to do with Uber?

315
00:14:31,757 --> 00:14:32,857
- Isaac wasn't.

316
00:14:32,857 --> 00:14:34,817
- Oh!

317
00:14:34,817 --> 00:14:37,737
So how many people did
Isaac do doggy-style?

318
00:14:37,737 --> 00:14:40,847
- Just one and I'm going
to go warn her now.

319
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:42,822
Uh-huh, yup!

320
00:14:42,823 --> 00:14:44,797
What a Monday!

321
00:14:45,897 --> 00:14:48,867
- So this book is
used to help me locate

322
00:14:48,867 --> 00:14:50,827
different worlds via
a cooperative spell?

323
00:14:50,827 --> 00:14:52,847
- It is called "The World Book."

324
00:14:52,847 --> 00:14:54,677
- Yes, I can read.

325
00:14:54,677 --> 00:14:55,877
So it's like the encyclopedia.

326
00:14:55,877 --> 00:14:57,797
- More like an atlas.

327
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:59,727
- What world are
you looking for?

328
00:14:59,727 --> 00:15:03,727
- One where I can be
happy, where I can belong.

329
00:15:04,797 --> 00:15:06,747
No, it's not what you think.

330
00:15:06,747 --> 00:15:08,717
I'm not interested in that.

331
00:15:08,717 --> 00:15:11,737
I... I just want to go somewhere
where I can do no harm.

332
00:15:11,737 --> 00:15:12,757
I'll never do that again.

333
00:15:12,758 --> 00:15:13,777
I swear on my life.

334
00:15:13,777 --> 00:15:15,757
- Yeah, well,
I don't know if I believe you.

335
00:15:16,857 --> 00:15:19,887
- I spent years being
tortured by Martin,

336
00:15:19,887 --> 00:15:26,717
plenty of time to think on
my actions and regret them.

337
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,312
Did you never unintentionally

338
00:15:28,313 --> 00:15:29,907
hurt someone you love, Alice?

339
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:33,857
- I never molested a child.

340
00:15:35,707 --> 00:15:37,827
But, yes,
I've done things I regret.

341
00:15:37,827 --> 00:15:39,697
- Don't you deserve happiness?

342
00:15:39,697 --> 00:15:40,767
- No.

343
00:15:40,767 --> 00:15:42,747
- Oh,
don't be so hard on yourself.

344
00:15:42,747 --> 00:15:43,857
We all deserve it.

345
00:15:43,857 --> 00:15:45,867
- I don't think you do.

346
00:15:47,707 --> 00:15:48,867
- Well, I don't particularly
care what you think.

347
00:15:48,867 --> 00:15:50,867
You need my help finding
the Revision Room.

348
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,797
So either you help
me with this spell

349
00:15:52,797 --> 00:15:54,907
or you're on your own.

350
00:15:57,817 --> 00:15:58,847
- Who are you?

351
00:15:58,848 --> 00:15:59,877
- Hi, uh, I'm Josh.

352
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:02,827
I'm Isaac's friend.

353
00:16:02,827 --> 00:16:04,627
- Isaac.

354
00:16:04,627 --> 00:16:06,817
- He hooked up with
you that one time.

355
00:16:06,817 --> 00:16:08,887
- Oh.

356
00:16:08,887 --> 00:16:11,627
Right.

357
00:16:11,627 --> 00:16:13,727
Look, it's a really
bad time right now.

358
00:16:13,727 --> 00:16:15,737
- Oh, uh, no,
Isaac really wanted me to talk to you

359
00:16:15,737 --> 00:16:16,867
about something and it's
kind of an emergency.

360
00:16:16,867 --> 00:16:19,707
So can I come in, please?

361
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:21,897
- How do you know Isaac again?

362
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:27,767
- Oh, uh... Uh,
he and I met at Jewish camp.

363
00:16:27,767 --> 00:16:28,877
- This is kind of weird.

364
00:16:28,877 --> 00:16:31,827
I mean, why did he send a
friend instead of, like,

365
00:16:30,747 --> 00:16:31,827
calling me himself?

366
00:16:31,827 --> 00:16:34,877
- He's got, uh, laryngitis.

367
00:16:34,877 --> 00:16:36,627
- So he can't text?

368
00:16:36,627 --> 00:16:39,707
- And he broke all
of his fingers.

369
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:43,717
Anyhoo, I've got to talk to
you about Isaac's problem,

370
00:16:43,717 --> 00:16:45,742
which he's embarrassed because

371
00:16:45,743 --> 00:16:47,767
he came down with something

372
00:16:47,767 --> 00:16:50,847
and he's afraid that you
might have caught it from him.

373
00:16:50,847 --> 00:16:52,747
- Caught what?

374
00:16:52,747 --> 00:16:56,747
- Oh,
just a... herpes-like thing.

375
00:16:56,747 --> 00:16:58,737
- He gave me herpes?

376
00:16:58,737 --> 00:16:59,767
- I believe I said herpes-like.

377
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:01,627
- Well, what the hell is it?

378
00:17:01,627 --> 00:17:02,777
- The only way to know if
you got it is to, sort of,

379
00:17:02,777 --> 00:17:05,717
go through the symptoms
and see if you've been

380
00:17:03,877 --> 00:17:05,717
experiencing them.

381
00:17:05,717 --> 00:17:09,897
- Okay, Josh from Jewish
camp, I'm going to discuss

382
00:17:09,897 --> 00:17:11,392
genital warts and
discharge with you

383
00:17:11,393 --> 00:17:12,887
'cause we just met.

384
00:17:14,707 --> 00:17:15,887
- Jesus Christ.
- Fuck my life!

385
00:17:15,887 --> 00:17:17,872
- Look, have you maybe not

386
00:17:17,873 --> 00:17:19,857
been feeling yourself lately?

387
00:17:19,857 --> 00:17:21,777
- Not really.

388
00:17:21,777 --> 00:17:24,767
And I'm beginning to
wonder why I let you in

389
00:17:22,857 --> 00:17:24,767
in the first place.

390
00:17:24,767 --> 00:17:27,737
- Great, and, uh,
have you maybe been having dreams

391
00:17:27,737 --> 00:17:29,837
that are weird and violent?

392
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:33,727
- Maybe.

393
00:17:33,727 --> 00:17:35,177
- Right, well, this last one

394
00:17:35,178 --> 00:17:38,127
might sound a little
crazy, but have you, maybe,

395
00:17:38,128 --> 00:17:41,627
been unable to control
yourself around guys?

396
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:42,787
- Get out of my apartment.

397
00:17:42,787 --> 00:17:44,717
- Oh, wait. No-no-no.

398
00:17:42,787 --> 00:17:45,837
- This wasn't... I mean...
- Seriously, get out!

399
00:17:45,837 --> 00:17:47,867
- Okay, please,
just let me help you.

400
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,867
I just want to help.

401
00:17:52,637 --> 00:17:55,637
- It's been a really
hard couple of days.

402
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,897
I've been totally
freaking, like...

403
00:18:01,777 --> 00:18:03,657
What's wrong with me?

404
00:18:03,657 --> 00:18:08,797
- I know what you mean
and it's completely normal

405
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:11,897
and I assure you,
this is not your fault.

406
00:18:11,897 --> 00:18:14,857
- That's so good to hear.

407
00:18:14,857 --> 00:18:21,907
I mean, how could I even
do that to someone else?

408
00:18:21,907 --> 00:18:25,627
It's a total mess in there.

409
00:18:25,627 --> 00:18:26,837
- Uh, a mess?
- Uh-huh.

410
00:18:26,837 --> 00:18:27,887
- Uh, where?

411
00:18:40,757 --> 00:18:42,737
- Jesus' tits.

412
00:18:42,737 --> 00:18:45,627
- It's not that bad, is it?

413
00:18:48,857 --> 00:18:50,837
- Is it possible for an entire

414
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,817
forest to do the walk of shame?

415
00:18:52,817 --> 00:18:57,667
- Seriously, nature is not
supposed to be this sticky.

416
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:02,847
- Uh-oh, you think she's
who we're looking for?

417
00:19:02,847 --> 00:19:04,777
- Whoa, whoa!
- Wait, wait! Don't!

418
00:19:04,777 --> 00:19:05,857
- Why not?

419
00:19:05,857 --> 00:19:07,877
- Because you have
something to live for?

420
00:19:07,877 --> 00:19:09,647
- I'm a Maenad.

421
00:19:09,647 --> 00:19:10,857
The God that I'm here
to serve is dead.

422
00:19:10,857 --> 00:19:13,787
I literally have
nothing to live for.

423
00:19:13,787 --> 00:19:15,317
But thanks... thanks for the less

424
00:19:15,318 --> 00:19:18,627
than basic understanding
of my life's purpose.

425
00:19:18,627 --> 00:19:19,817
- No, no, no! Wait!
- Don't, please.

426
00:19:19,817 --> 00:19:21,827
We need your help.

427
00:19:22,887 --> 00:19:24,777
- Shoshana.

428
00:19:24,777 --> 00:19:26,867
- Shoshana.
- We need your help, Shoshana.

429
00:19:29,647 --> 00:19:30,847
Hmm?

430
00:19:30,847 --> 00:19:33,867
- Peach Schnapps.

431
00:19:33,867 --> 00:19:37,627
Bacchus left that for the
talking bears to find.

432
00:19:37,627 --> 00:19:39,857
- Okay, so how about a toast?

433
00:19:39,857 --> 00:19:41,877
Right? Ba... Bacchus would've
wanted us to drink.

434
00:19:41,877 --> 00:19:42,877
God, like, so much.

435
00:19:42,878 --> 00:19:43,877
Yeah.

436
00:19:43,877 --> 00:19:46,637
- Okay, so to Bacchus.

437
00:19:49,657 --> 00:19:50,907
- To Bacchus.

438
00:19:50,907 --> 00:19:52,787
- God,
it smells like pee sangria.

439
00:19:52,787 --> 00:19:54,677
- I don't give a shit.
- Drink it.

440
00:19:54,677 --> 00:19:56,827
- To, uh, Bacchus!

441
00:19:56,827 --> 00:19:57,862
- Bacchus.

442
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:58,897
- Whoo!

443
00:20:05,647 --> 00:20:08,847
Oh, that's good shit.

444
00:20:08,847 --> 00:20:11,787
- Um, I was a goddess
and I gave away my power

445
00:20:11,787 --> 00:20:14,637
and now I can't use magic.

446
00:20:14,637 --> 00:20:15,847
Only I'm indestructible.

447
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:19,857
So maybe you can help me
understand what is going on.

448
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,877
- You were a goddess?

449
00:20:23,877 --> 00:20:26,807
- Yeah.

450
00:20:27,877 --> 00:20:31,847
If all these other Maenads
hadn't run through the poison

451
00:20:31,847 --> 00:20:34,627
- wine like a bunch of bitches,
I wouldn't even be - in this situation!

452
00:20:34,627 --> 00:20:36,857
- Well,
maybe if you help us we can...

453
00:20:48,827 --> 00:20:50,647
- I'm sorry.

454
00:20:50,647 --> 00:20:52,627
- What are you...
- What are you doing?

455
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:53,887
- I'm trying to read your aura.

456
00:20:57,697 --> 00:21:00,727
- Maybe we can just get the
pinecone out of my face?

457
00:21:05,717 --> 00:21:07,657
Okay.

458
00:21:07,657 --> 00:21:08,857
- That's what I thought.

459
00:21:08,857 --> 00:21:10,837
Inconclusive.

460
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:12,837
I do know a ritual that could

461
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,837
help diagnose you further.

462
00:21:14,837 --> 00:21:17,667
But, um, it's pretty intimate.

463
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:18,787
- Um, okay.

464
00:21:18,788 --> 00:21:19,907
I can live with that.

465
00:21:19,907 --> 00:21:22,867
- Yeah, the only thing is
I... I... I can't perform it.

466
00:21:22,867 --> 00:21:25,627
- Uh, why not?

467
00:21:25,627 --> 00:21:26,817
- I don't believe in you.

468
00:21:26,817 --> 00:21:30,192
I can help interpret,
but you need someone

469
00:21:30,193 --> 00:21:34,837
who believes in you,
okay, who worships you,

470
00:21:34,837 --> 00:21:38,847
body and soul,
to perform the ritual.

471
00:21:41,627 --> 00:21:42,737
Anyone come to mind?

472
00:21:47,877 --> 00:21:50,887
- Fine, I'll help.

473
00:21:55,677 --> 00:21:57,647
- Jesus R.R. Christ.

474
00:21:57,647 --> 00:22:00,857
An innocent girl is a
murderer 'cause I couldn't get

475
00:22:00,858 --> 00:22:01,887
to her in time.

476
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:05,627
- Oh, put your tit back in
your training bra, wolf boy.

477
00:22:05,627 --> 00:22:08,627
We don't really know how
innocent this girl was.

478
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:11,807
Sleeping with her Uber
driver sounds like she had

479
00:22:09,857 --> 00:22:11,807
a death wish to begin with.

480
00:22:11,807 --> 00:22:12,827
- You're not helping.

481
00:22:12,828 --> 00:22:13,847
- Drink.

482
00:22:13,847 --> 00:22:15,827
- Is this a potion?
- It's alcohol.

483
00:22:15,827 --> 00:22:17,687
- Good enough.

484
00:22:17,687 --> 00:22:19,717
- While you were busy
with your domestic issues,

485
00:22:19,717 --> 00:22:22,627
I managed to translate
this Indonesian ritual

486
00:22:22,627 --> 00:22:24,727
and good news is this
is first-year Brakebills

487
00:22:24,727 --> 00:22:26,727
multi-culti elective crap.

488
00:22:26,727 --> 00:22:29,707
So we can definitely pull
it off without breaking

489
00:22:27,877 --> 00:22:29,707
the magic bank.

490
00:22:29,707 --> 00:22:33,897
Only prob is finding
one exotic ingredient.

491
00:22:33,897 --> 00:22:39,727
- Uh, what type of exotic
are we talking about here?

492
00:22:39,727 --> 00:22:42,642
- We need a living Komodo
dragon so we can cut out

493
00:22:42,643 --> 00:22:45,857
its heart,
and I heard a rumor Kanye keeps

494
00:22:43,637 --> 00:22:45,857
one in his New York apartment.

495
00:22:45,857 --> 00:22:47,677
- That sounds on-brand.

496
00:22:47,677 --> 00:22:48,837
- Let's go.

497
00:22:51,627 --> 00:22:53,877
- Uh... uh, wait.
- I have to give you something.

498
00:22:55,727 --> 00:22:57,737
It's loaded with silver bullets.

499
00:22:57,737 --> 00:22:59,757
The Quickening has started to

500
00:22:59,757 --> 00:23:04,647
do weird things to me and...
Well, if I wolf-out,

501
00:23:04,647 --> 00:23:05,847
you might need to stop me.

502
00:23:09,627 --> 00:23:12,677
- It's not gonna come to that.

503
00:23:12,677 --> 00:23:15,637
I promise.

504
00:23:15,637 --> 00:23:17,142
Now come on.

505
00:23:17,143 --> 00:23:18,647
Let's go steal Kanye's lizard.

506
00:23:46,837 --> 00:23:50,827
- As you can see,
it's rather hard to get in unseen.

507
00:23:50,827 --> 00:23:52,757
- Not if you can bend light.

508
00:23:52,757 --> 00:23:55,677
- Regardless,
stealing the books isn't really

509
00:23:55,677 --> 00:23:57,697
the biggest issue, is it?

510
00:23:57,697 --> 00:23:58,857
If the library
discovers they're gone,

511
00:23:58,857 --> 00:23:59,897
they're gonna come after you.

512
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:03,657
- Yeah, but if they read my
book, they'll know exactly

513
00:24:01,667 --> 00:24:03,657
where I'll be.

514
00:24:03,657 --> 00:24:06,767
- Yes,
but what if they read your book

515
00:24:06,767 --> 00:24:09,697
and still had no
idea where you were?

516
00:24:11,707 --> 00:24:12,867
- What are you proposing?

517
00:24:12,867 --> 00:24:15,657
- When I was writing
"The Wandering Dune,"

518
00:24:15,657 --> 00:24:17,737
I was also studying magic.

519
00:24:17,737 --> 00:24:21,307
I... I kept blowing deadlines
until I found a spell

520
00:24:21,308 --> 00:24:22,887
for automatic writing.

521
00:24:22,887 --> 00:24:25,802
Now, you feed it a
premise and it constructs

522
00:24:25,803 --> 00:24:26,897
an airtight storyline.

523
00:24:26,897 --> 00:24:29,857
I... I gather they use it
in Hollywood all the time.

524
00:24:29,857 --> 00:24:31,877
- That explains Netflix.

525
00:24:33,667 --> 00:24:34,867
How does this spell work?

526
00:24:34,867 --> 00:24:37,667
- Uh, we steal the
manuscripts, pull the endings,

527
00:24:37,667 --> 00:24:39,667
cast a spell on them,
and then replace them

528
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:41,737
just before they take them
away to bind them as books.

529
00:24:41,737 --> 00:24:43,757
Voilà!

530
00:24:41,737 --> 00:24:44,907
Oh, you'll be very surprised
how your stories turn out,

531
00:24:44,907 --> 00:24:46,657
- Let me guess.

532
00:24:46,657 --> 00:24:49,627
You'll show me how to do
the spell if I help you

533
00:24:47,727 --> 00:24:49,627
with the World Book?

534
00:24:49,627 --> 00:24:51,727
- Well, that only seems
fair, doesn't it?

535
00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:56,647
Look,
do you want my help or not?

536
00:25:05,627 --> 00:25:07,737
- Mom, I told you I'd have
this done by tomorrow.

537
00:25:07,737 --> 00:25:09,767
So just... ah, Jesus.

538
00:25:10,797 --> 00:25:12,667
Hello?

539
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:14,717
- I found these in your
dead father's fridge.

540
00:25:15,727 --> 00:25:18,767
They're not quite what
I'd hoped they'd be.

541
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,787
You finished with
the killing yet?

542
00:25:20,787 --> 00:25:22,897
- With the, uh... what?

543
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:24,777
- You father's dead.

544
00:25:24,777 --> 00:25:27,627
I thought perhaps you'd
get angry and kill things.

545
00:25:27,627 --> 00:25:28,867
That's what I'd do.

546
00:25:28,867 --> 00:25:30,727
- It's not really
what people do.

547
00:25:31,727 --> 00:25:32,887
Nowadays, anyway.

548
00:25:32,887 --> 00:25:36,697
- You're not going
to kill anything?

549
00:25:36,697 --> 00:25:37,907
Interesting.

550
00:25:40,787 --> 00:25:42,647
Frozen peas?

551
00:25:42,647 --> 00:25:43,667
- Nope.

552
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:44,687
Uh, no thanks.

553
00:25:45,897 --> 00:25:47,697
- Let's go then.

554
00:25:47,697 --> 00:25:48,907
I'm bored of this food.

555
00:25:48,907 --> 00:25:52,647
- Can I just have a few
minutes to finish this?

556
00:25:55,717 --> 00:25:57,627
- This is important to you.

557
00:25:58,787 --> 00:26:00,877
- Yeah, it is.

558
00:26:00,877 --> 00:26:03,687
- This is a very
interesting game,

559
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:06,797
the loving your dead dad game.

560
00:26:09,637 --> 00:26:10,817
I don't understand it.

561
00:26:10,817 --> 00:26:12,307
- It's not a game.

562
00:26:12,308 --> 00:26:18,637
It... There must be someone
who's important to you,

563
00:26:18,637 --> 00:26:20,897
who you... who you miss.

564
00:26:20,897 --> 00:26:22,877
- I don't remember.

565
00:26:22,877 --> 00:26:24,757
But perhaps you're right.

566
00:26:24,757 --> 00:26:27,627
I could learn
something from this.

567
00:26:28,677 --> 00:26:30,667
I'll let you play this game.

568
00:26:30,667 --> 00:26:34,717
I will sit still and
I won't kill anything

569
00:26:34,717 --> 00:26:37,627
and I'll watch you while
you... you think about

570
00:26:37,627 --> 00:26:38,727
your dead father?

571
00:26:38,727 --> 00:26:40,677
Is that what you're doing?

572
00:26:40,677 --> 00:26:42,242
- Yeah.

573
00:26:42,243 --> 00:26:43,807
Kind of.

574
00:26:44,887 --> 00:26:48,627
- This is the weirdest
thing I've ever done.

575
00:26:51,897 --> 00:26:53,907
But maybe it'll be fun.

576
00:27:05,687 --> 00:27:07,817
- I... she wasn't lying.

577
00:27:07,817 --> 00:27:11,807
This is pretty intimate.

578
00:27:11,807 --> 00:27:14,707
- Yeah, well, you're not the
one who has to strip naked

579
00:27:14,707 --> 00:27:15,907
and be anointed with oil.

580
00:27:20,687 --> 00:27:22,707
- Are you sure you
want to do this?

581
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:24,757
- I don't really see another
way, do you?

582
00:27:25,887 --> 00:27:28,707
- Wait, um,
maybe there is another way?

583
00:27:28,707 --> 00:27:31,627
Uh...

584
00:27:31,907 --> 00:27:33,807
Something a little less painful?

585
00:27:33,807 --> 00:27:35,767
- Painful?
- Not... not painful.

586
00:27:35,767 --> 00:27:40,627
- Um...
- You know I'm not broken, right?

587
00:27:40,807 --> 00:27:43,777
I'm not some flower or a
delicate piece of glass.

588
00:27:45,787 --> 00:27:49,807
I'm a person and people heal.

589
00:27:51,627 --> 00:27:53,272
- Yeah, look,
I'm ju... I'm just not very

590
00:27:53,273 --> 00:27:55,697
comfortable with the way
this is going down, you know?

591
00:27:55,697 --> 00:27:57,827
- Yeah, well,
this isn't really about you.

592
00:27:57,827 --> 00:28:00,627
So maybe you could
just get over yourself.

593
00:28:01,667 --> 00:28:02,837
- I'm trying.

594
00:28:04,787 --> 00:28:06,757

haven't seen before.

00:28:12,687 --> 00:28:14,767
Ta-da.

596
00:28:18,627 --> 00:28:20,837

wolf-hump me to death?

but you're safe now, okay?

- How?

656

would be interesting.

665
00:32:32,677 --> 00:32:33,727
It's not.

666
00:32:33,727 --> 00:32:34,742

A little while longer
and then we can go.

669
00:32:41,717 --> 00:32:43,672
Why did you do that?

670
00:32:43,673 --> 00:32:45,627
- Slightly more interesting.

671
00:32:45,627 --> 00:32:47,677
- No.

672
00:32:47,677 --> 00:32:48,677
Stop it!

673
00:32:49,897 --> 00:32:51,297
I don't understand.

674
00:32:51,298 --> 00:32:52,697
Your father is dead, right?

675
00:32:52,697 --> 00:32:54,707
So these belong to you
now, do they not?

676
00:32:54,707 --> 00:32:56,817
- Yes, they belong to me.

677
00:32:56,817 --> 00:32:58,697
What is your point?

678
00:32:58,697 --> 00:32:59,827
- Why are you doing any of this?

679
00:32:59,827 --> 00:33:03,707
- Because I told my mom I
would, okay?

680
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:07,197
Jesus Christ, I can't believe

681
00:33:07,198 --> 00:33:08,677
I'm having to explain this.

682
00:33:08,677 --> 00:33:10,692
- Why does your mother have

683
00:33:10,693 --> 00:33:12,707
such strange power over you?

684
00:33:14,657 --> 00:33:18,757
- Because once, when I was a
kid, I broke an ashtray.

685
00:33:18,757 --> 00:33:20,737
And now she still fucking

686
00:33:20,738 --> 00:33:22,717
thinks that I break everything.

687
00:33:22,717 --> 00:33:26,357
Because...
Basically, your parents never

688
00:33:26,358 --> 00:33:27,817
change how they see you.

689
00:33:27,817 --> 00:33:29,757
No matter what.

690
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:33,827
- So if they can't
change how they see you,

691
00:33:33,827 --> 00:33:37,647
then why does it matter?

692
00:33:37,647 --> 00:33:39,627
- Because sometimes
I think she's right.

693
00:33:40,717 --> 00:33:42,647
Things break around me.

694
00:33:43,737 --> 00:33:48,907
Alice, my dad,
all of goddamn magic.

695
00:33:48,907 --> 00:33:51,667
- Then break them on purpose.

696
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:52,827
They're your planes.

697
00:33:52,827 --> 00:33:55,687
You can do what
you want with them.

698
00:33:55,687 --> 00:33:58,677
Maybe you'll feel better.

699
00:35:02,777 --> 00:35:05,247
- I don't meant to be
rude, but here I am helping

700
00:35:05,248 --> 00:35:07,797
as promised without an
assurance you'll do the same.

701
00:35:07,797 --> 00:35:09,637
- Jesus, you're relentless.

702
00:35:09,637 --> 00:35:11,677
- Okay, fine.
- I'll help you with your spell.

703
00:35:11,677 --> 00:35:13,837
- Yet you seem to
hate yourself for it.

704
00:35:13,837 --> 00:35:16,677
I mean,
you can understand my worry.

705
00:35:16,677 --> 00:35:18,657
- I don't have to
be happy about it.

706
00:35:18,657 --> 00:35:19,797
- A word of advice.

707
00:35:19,797 --> 00:35:22,627
If you want to survive,
stop torturing yourself.

708
00:35:22,627 --> 00:35:24,857
- Maybe you could do will
a little more self-hatred.

709
00:35:24,857 --> 00:35:27,757
And fewer Mr. Rogers vests.

710
00:35:27,757 --> 00:35:30,697
- You think that what
you've done and who you are

711
00:35:30,698 --> 00:35:31,737
are the same thing.

712
00:35:31,737 --> 00:35:33,797
When they don't match
up, you hate yourself.

713
00:35:33,797 --> 00:35:35,817
Alice, they'll never match up.

714
00:35:35,817 --> 00:35:37,737
- You don't know
anything about me.

715
00:35:37,737 --> 00:35:39,717
- I know what it feels
like to be unable to change

716
00:35:39,717 --> 00:35:41,857
no matter how much I want to.

717
00:35:41,857 --> 00:35:43,767
Children don't care if you

718
00:35:43,768 --> 00:35:45,677
contradict yourself, you know?

719
00:35:46,837 --> 00:35:48,737
- Perhaps that's a bad
example coming from me,

720
00:35:48,737 --> 00:35:50,817
but I'm just trying to help.

721
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:54,697
- Please just stop doing...

722
00:36:00,777 --> 00:36:01,857
- What is it?

723
00:36:01,857 --> 00:36:04,717
- The end of Quentin's book.

724
00:36:04,717 --> 00:36:06,697
He's going to die.

725
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:08,857
- Isn't that how all books end?

726
00:36:10,657 --> 00:36:12,677
- His ends next week.

727
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:19,837
- Uh, as requested,
the water my feet were bathed in.

728
00:36:22,817 --> 00:36:24,777
- Ugh, that's pretty murky.

729
00:36:24,777 --> 00:36:26,777
- Okay, judgey.

730
00:36:26,777 --> 00:36:27,837
What's it mean?

731
00:36:27,837 --> 00:36:30,657
- It's too early to say.

732
00:36:30,657 --> 00:36:32,817
This is very interesting though.

733
00:36:32,817 --> 00:36:35,677
I thought you said you
didn't have any power.

734
00:36:35,677 --> 00:36:36,747
- No. I... I don't.

735
00:36:36,748 --> 00:36:37,817
I can't do magic.

736
00:36:37,817 --> 00:36:39,797
- Those aren't the same.

737
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:44,837
Oh, this... This is real weird.

738
00:36:48,717 --> 00:36:51,797
You weren't bullshitting
me when you said you were

739
00:36:49,817 --> 00:36:51,797
a goddess, were you?

740
00:36:51,797 --> 00:36:54,837
- No,
but how... how can I be a goddess

741
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,717
if I don't have any power?

742
00:36:56,717 --> 00:36:58,817
- Maybe you think you
don't, but...

743
00:37:00,737 --> 00:37:03,777
I have never seen
anything like this before.

744
00:37:05,737 --> 00:37:07,717
- So we're good now?

745
00:37:07,717 --> 00:37:10,697
You're not gonna kill yourself?

746
00:37:10,697 --> 00:37:11,887
- No, I can't now.

747
00:37:11,887 --> 00:37:13,877
I have a new deity to follow.

748
00:37:16,877 --> 00:37:18,857
- Oh, boy.

749
00:37:27,677 --> 00:37:29,657
- I think you're overreacting.

750
00:37:29,657 --> 00:37:31,797
- I could've sexually
assaulted you or ate you.

751
00:37:31,797 --> 00:37:33,697
I don't honestly know how
things would've turned out.

752
00:37:33,697 --> 00:37:34,717
- It's no reason to give up.

753
00:37:34,717 --> 00:37:35,797
There's got to be a solution.

754
00:37:35,797 --> 00:37:38,737
- I've got, what,
a couple hours before the Quickening

755
00:37:38,737 --> 00:37:40,857
takes over,
and I'm sorry if that

756
00:37:38,737 --> 00:37:42,797
makes me a wimp or whatever,
but I don't want to rape

757
00:37:40,857 --> 00:37:42,797
or murder anyone.

758
00:37:42,797 --> 00:37:44,737
- Oh, come on.

759
00:37:44,737 --> 00:37:46,857
There are plenty of people
who deserve to be killed.

760
00:37:46,857 --> 00:37:49,737
I can think of a half
dozen at Brakebills alone.

761
00:37:49,737 --> 00:37:50,907
If you can just keep
your twat together,

762
00:37:50,907 --> 00:37:53,887
I'm sure I can get at least
one of them down here.

763
00:37:53,887 --> 00:37:55,837
I mean, Todd totally owes me.

764
00:37:55,837 --> 00:37:57,907
- He doesn't owe you his life.

765
00:37:57,907 --> 00:38:00,697
- Doesn't he?

766
00:38:02,717 --> 00:38:03,857
- I can't do it, Margo.

767
00:38:03,857 --> 00:38:07,737
- Well, you can't do
nothing, because you'll die

768
00:38:05,757 --> 00:38:07,737
in this cage.

769
00:38:07,737 --> 00:38:08,857
- At least I can live with that.

770
00:38:08,857 --> 00:38:13,677
I mean, not live exactly,
but you get what I'm saying.

771
00:38:13,677 --> 00:38:14,887
- This is bullshit.

772
00:38:14,887 --> 00:38:16,777
You're just throwing
your life away.

773
00:38:16,777 --> 00:38:18,737
- I was thinking more
like noble sacrifice.

774
00:38:18,737 --> 00:38:20,877
- Screw your noble sacrifice!

775
00:38:20,877 --> 00:38:24,697
What is it with you boys
and your noble sacrifice?

776
00:38:24,697 --> 00:38:25,837
I'm not gonna let you do it.

777
00:38:25,837 --> 00:38:26,907
- Well, it's not your choice.

778
00:38:26,907 --> 00:38:28,737
You can't fix me, okay?

779
00:38:28,737 --> 00:38:31,717
Some things are just
broken, and there's nothing

780
00:38:29,837 --> 00:38:31,717
you can do about it.

781
00:38:31,717 --> 00:38:32,797
- Said the quitter
right before he quit.

782
00:38:32,797 --> 00:38:33,877
- You think I want to die?

783
00:38:33,877 --> 00:38:35,777
Of course I fucking don't!

784
00:38:35,777 --> 00:38:36,907
But I don't see a
way out of this,

785
00:38:36,907 --> 00:38:39,747
and frankly you not
giving up is making what

786
00:38:39,748 --> 00:38:40,777
I have to do harder.

787
00:38:44,797 --> 00:38:46,817

00:38:51,737 --> 00:38:53,797
Fine by me.

789
00:38:53,797 --> 00:38:55,777
- What the hell are you doing?

790
00:38:55,777 --> 00:38:57,717
- Something stupider.

791
00:39:01,817 --> 00:39:02,897
- This isn't a joke, Margo!

792
00:39:03,817 --> 00:39:04,907
I'm not going to be
able to control myself.

793
00:39:04,907 --> 00:39:09,797
- I might kill you or... or...
- Or what?

794
00:39:09,797 --> 00:39:11,837
Fuck me?

795
00:39:14,657 --> 00:39:16,627
- Margo.

796
00:39:16,627 --> 00:39:19,737
This curse isn't curable.

797
00:39:19,737 --> 00:39:20,887
I don't want you
to go through this.

798
00:39:20,887 --> 00:39:22,797
The Quickening is... - Why not?

799
00:39:22,797 --> 00:39:27,737
- Because... I like you.

800
00:39:27,737 --> 00:39:30,797
- I like you too.

801
00:39:30,797 --> 00:39:33,887
And I'm not gonna lose
another friend today, okay?

802
00:39:37,657 --> 00:39:43,797
I can't make you kill
someone, but I can consent.

803
00:39:50,777 --> 00:39:52,637
Damn.

804
00:39:52,637 --> 00:39:54,677
The Quickening makes you
a really good kisser.

805
00:39:54,677 --> 00:39:56,677
- I know.

806
00:40:00,797 --> 00:40:05,837
- That was more cathartic
than I thought it would be.

807
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:08,817
- It was kind of fun, wasn't it?

808
00:40:11,697 --> 00:40:16,657
It feels good after you deal with
death, doesn't it?

809
00:40:16,657 --> 00:40:18,657
- A little.

810
00:40:18,657 --> 00:40:22,877
Still hurts, but...
eventually it hurts a little less.

811
00:40:26,637 --> 00:40:29,697
- I'm going to need your
help to search for more Gods.

812
00:40:29,697 --> 00:40:32,677
You'll be more useful to
me if you feel better,

813
00:40:32,677 --> 00:40:37,697
so you should know that
your friend Eliot is dead.

814
00:40:41,637 --> 00:40:44,657
You can smash more
things if you want.

815
00:40:44,657 --> 00:40:47,837
And then we'll go
get something to eat.

816
00:40:47,837 --> 00:40:49,837
Sound good?

817
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:58,907
- I cannot believe
you just did that.

818
00:40:58,907 --> 00:41:00,397
- I rocked your world.

819
00:41:00,398 --> 00:41:01,887
Get over it.

820
00:41:01,887 --> 00:41:05,837
- Oh, no, you... that was great.

821
00:41:05,837 --> 00:41:09,637
It's just you can't
have sex now with anyone

822
00:41:09,637 --> 00:41:12,907
who isn't L-positive
without infecting them.

823
00:41:12,907 --> 00:41:17,697
- You know, so...
- Since when is P-in-the-V sex

824
00:41:17,697 --> 00:41:20,677
the pinnacle of what one
or two or three or five

825
00:41:20,677 --> 00:41:22,817
or an animal can do together?

826
00:41:22,817 --> 00:41:25,677
I mean,
it's not even on my top ten.

827
00:41:26,907 --> 00:41:29,697
I guess I see your point there.

828
00:41:29,697 --> 00:41:31,292
All the same, what are you

829
00:41:31,293 --> 00:41:32,887
gonna do about the Quickening?

830
00:41:32,887 --> 00:41:34,837
How are you gonna handle that?

831
00:41:34,837 --> 00:41:36,887
- In what, 30 years?

832
00:41:36,887 --> 00:41:38,797
No way I'm gonna live that long.

833
00:41:38,797 --> 00:41:40,717
And if I do,
Todd totally owes me.

834
00:41:40,717 --> 00:41:42,837
- You're joking, right?

835
00:41:42,837 --> 00:41:45,717
You're joking.

836
00:41:48,637 --> 00:41:49,762

life, bitch.

840
00:42:01,697 --> 00:42:05,637
- Casual that.

841
00:42:05,637 --> 00:42:07,637

I'm sorry we couldn't
figure out a way to help,

843
00:42:13,677 --> 00:42:19,677
you know... - I am too.

844
00:42:21,677 --> 00:42:23,887
I would have done
anything to save him.

845
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:30,737
But I think he might
actually be gone.

846
00:42:34,817 --> 00:42:37,837
- I felt the moment
his soul died.

847
00:42:39,877 --> 00:42:42,657
It only hurt for a second.

848
00:42:42,657 --> 00:42:46,757
I promise he didn't suffer.

849
00:42:48,907 --> 00:42:51,657
You'll come around.

850
00:42:51,657 --> 00:42:55,637
