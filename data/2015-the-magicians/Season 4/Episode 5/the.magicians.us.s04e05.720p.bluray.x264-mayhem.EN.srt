00:00:00,918 --> 00:00:02,534
<i>Previously on</i>
The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,628 --> 00:00:04,790
- Will you play with me?
- No!

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,212
You do remember me,
don't you?

4
00:00:06,298 --> 00:00:08,460
- I'm Christopher...
- Plover.

5
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,291
<i>You were looking
for your book.</i>

6
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:12,843
<i>Yours and your friends' books
are in the Revision Room.</i>

7
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,047
<i>But I happen to know
where that is.</i>

8
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:17,507
The end of Quentin's book.
He's going to die.

9
00:00:17,601 --> 00:00:19,388
Isn't that how
all books end?

10
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:20,764
His ends next week.

11
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:24,939
Your birthright box, which it
has been my honor to guard,

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,978
dictated your absence from
the kingdom and your return.

13
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,400
We need
your help, Shoshana.

14
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:34,065
I have a new deity to follow.

15
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,323
<i>The Poison Room fountain has
a stack of books for a statue.</i>

16
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,766
<i>- So, if we find the right fountain...
- We can walk right in.</i>

17
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,498
<i>When you get back
what the gods took from you,</i>

18
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:45,372
could I maybe
have Eliot back?

19
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:50,211
<i>You were friends
with Eliot. Very best friends.</i>

20
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,338
You should know that
your friend Eliot is dead.

21
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:55,924
<i>I felt the moment
his soul died.</i>

22
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:58,593
Or he's trapped in there.

23
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,516
<i>Forced to watch everything
The Monster does,</i>

24
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:03,515
<i>just waiting for us
to find a way to help him.</i>

25
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,600
<i>Hello?</i>

26
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:12,854
There's one thing

27
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:16,032
every resident of the Physical Kids
cottage must know.

28
00:01:16,368 --> 00:01:17,825
Where the bathroom is.

29
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:19,994
- How to make...
- How to make...

30
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,684
- ...our signature cocktail.
- How to make our signature cocktail.

31
00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:23,869
That's what
I was trying to...

32
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,040
That's what I meant to say.

33
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:27,914
Oh.

34
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,000
Now you can make it
on your own.

35
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:34,713
Should I get that?

36
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:40,135
Rather not.

37
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,472
Ah!

38
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,771
- There you are.
- Here I am.

39
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,227
Sorry, I had to interrupt
an orgy upstairs.

40
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,975
You broke up the orgy?

41
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:54,233
No, I told them there was
a bigger room two doors down.

42
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:55,905
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

43
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,776
Now,
I don't say this lightly,

44
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,408
but I think this might be
our best party yet.

45
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:05,911
And I say this with the weight
of my whole heart.

46
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:07,579
I concur.

47
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:11,955
- I'll get it.
- Don't.

48
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:15,167
Whoever is that desperate
to come in can't be fun.

49
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:20,931
Oh.

50
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:23,758
What do you like most
about summer?

51
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,059
Mmm...

52
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,095
Nothing.

53
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:28,850
You don't like summer?

54
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:33,526
No.

55
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:36,404
Nothing's what I love
about summer.

56
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,028
No class, no people,

57
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,906
just beautiful nothing.

58
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,409
No.

59
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,076
Go make me a drink.

60
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:51,828
Okay.

61
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,508
I'm Eliot, by the way.

62
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:58,835
Uh-oh.

63
00:02:58,929 --> 00:03:00,636
That's...
Eliot's my name, too.

64
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,390
Well, that can't be.
What's your middle name?

65
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,054
Um...

66
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,144
Todd?

67
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,350
Should I get that?

68
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,397
Never answer a cop knock.

69
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,567
Beautiful nothing.

70
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,949
Now that's the kind
of man I need.

71
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,158
Don't answer it.
Then we have to talk to them.

72
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,865
Oh, come on. I just want
to see who it is.

73
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,744
No, you can't come in.

74
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,082
Well, I'm sorry, but that sounds
like a you problem.

75
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:39,427
Margo!

76
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,002
Margo!

77
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,349
Eliot!

78
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,646
- Inside. Inside, we must go inside...
- What?

79
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,922
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, no. Do we know you?
- They're coming.

80
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:01,986
Let me inside, please. I won't harm her.
This is only for your urgent attention.

81
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,652
Yeah, I'm not worried
about you harming her.

82
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,998
But you make a point.
Uh, let's go.

83
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,091
Are you done being sad now?

84
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,476
- I need your help.
- No, I'm not.

85
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:34,055
Is this about your friend?

86
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,641
Because that's not
a problem.

87
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:38,563
I'm your friend.

88
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,278
He's gone, but I'm here.

89
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:42,897
Same number of friends.

90
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,200
So...

91
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,659
What is this?

92
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,326
How am I supposed to know?

93
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,499
I would like for you
to be helpful, Quentin.

94
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,168
It's...

95
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,716
Really old?

96
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,048
Like
beginning-of-civilization old.

97
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,219
And where was that?

98
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,140
Mesopotamia
was the first...

99
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,472
That's very helpful, thank you.
I will see you back at the apartment.

100
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:29,402
So spacious.

101
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:31,859
Mine wasn't nearly
half this size.

102
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,328
What's with the...

103
00:05:35,961 --> 00:05:37,327
That out there, is it...

104
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,748
Sorry, I'm at a loss for words,
which is new for me.

105
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,128
I'm sure you're
quite flummoxed.

106
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:44,459
Sit, sit, sit.

107
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,213
Well, the good news,
a monster possessed you

108
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,672
and is inhabiting your body.

109
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,341
- What?
- He normally tears people to shreds,

110
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,892
so, believe me,
this is preferable.

111
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,081
And when he possessed you...

112
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,562
he thrust all of you

113
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,474
to this nook of your mind that
holds all your remembrances.

114
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:01,442
Everything here is
a remembrance.

115
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,936
Even your friend here.

116
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:07,528
Now, do me a favor.
Imagine she's not here.

117
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,624
- What the fuck?
- Tell me.

118
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,437
I've been trying
to understand it.

119
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:19,577
I just can't figure it out.

120
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:21,002
What is "fuck"?

121
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:27,009
Well, um, it's sort of, like,
a chameleon of a word.

122
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,463
Wait, um... Who are you?

123
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:31,673
Oh. Uh...

124
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:33,929
Well, I'm Charlton.

125
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:37,971
Now, I have repressed
many memories,

126
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,557
but I would never forget
somebody named Charlton.

127
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,142
- Thank you.
- Not a compliment.

128
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,650
I'm not a memory. I once was
possessed by The Monster, too.

129
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:50,316
I was in my memory for...
It's hard to say.

130
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,902
That's it. I'm pretty sure
I shot you.

131
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,282
Or your body, at least.

132
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:55,950
Sorry.

133
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,452
No bother.

134
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,331
It was The Monster's
longer than it was mine.

135
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,128
And I have quite enjoyed
the change of scenery.

136
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:04,872
This is what I call
your Happy Place.

137
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:08,171
All your pleasant
remembrances live here.

138
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:12,426
It's very easy to get content
and lose track of time. And reality.

139
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,928
So, you're here
to break me out.

140
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,890
My knight in drab armor.

141
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,221
No, that would be ridiculous.
We stay here.

142
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:24,309
- We don't. I'm taking my body back.
- No, no, no.

143
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,065
This is the only place
the creatures can't come.

144
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,438
We can't... Oh. Right.

145
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,945
The scary shrieky things
that live outside.

146
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,993
- What are they?
- The Monster's other hosts.

147
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,238
Inmates from the Castle.

148
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:41,201
Horrible, wretched mistakes of the gods,
all of them.

149
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,206
Yeah, but if this is
all my memory,

150
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,776
then they
can't really hurt us, right?

151
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,918
Would you care
to ask the Knight Ora?

152
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,340
She was here before you.

153
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,904
- I would, actually.
- Well, you can't.

154
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:51,794
Because she's dead.
Dead fuck.

155
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,179
That's not quite right.

156
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:57,679
And I told her that when you die here,
you're gone forever.

157
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:00,978
But she just had to try and find her door,
and pray imagine what befell her?

158
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:02,730
Devoured by creatures.

159
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,687
Flesh rent from her bones,
skin torn from her skull.

160
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:08,520
She died staring
at her own face held before her.

161
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,069
- That is awful.
- Yeah.

162
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:14,988
What's this about a door?

163
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,387
Could you not, please?

164
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:23,876
What, no time for cheer?

165
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,461
We escaped the Library, safe.

166
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,793
You hid your friends.
They're safe, too.

167
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,340
Yeah, well, not Quentin.

168
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:33,427
And what exactly
are you gonna do about it, hmm?

169
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,879
Besides scowl?

170
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,555
Save him.

171
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,179
Warn him, I don't know.
I don't owe you an answer.

172
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,677
You wanna know
what I think?

173
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,181
Jesus God, never.

174
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:45,856
I think we need to cast another spell
on that book for you.

175
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,935
I know exactly where I need to go.
Quentin's book showed me where he is.

176
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,895
And he only has
a couple days left.

177
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,356
Oh. So, you trust one book
and not the other.

178
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,691
That's funny.

179
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,973
There's only one place I can
try to make things right.

180
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,363
Redemption arc.

181
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,328
Word of advice,
'cause I can see you need it,

182
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,334
apologize for what you've done, fine,
but never for who you are.

183
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:09,129
'Cause you'll never be able
to change that. So, why pretend?

184
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,136
We're getting closer,
aren't we?

185
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,472
Just a few fountains away.

186
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:24,311
All I need
is one moment

187
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:28,232
to find my friends
and tell them I'm alive. Help me.

188
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,356
Or I'm kicking you
out of the Happy Place.

189
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:34,109
- I can do that. Right?
- Yeah.

190
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,068
There's a door somewhere.

191
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,538
Hidden deep
in a forgotten remembrance.

192
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,035
Forgotten remembrance?

193
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,005
For me, it was the door
to my childhood bedroom.

194
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,619
But not part
of the memory.

195
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,838
- Just there.
- What memory?

196
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,757
How did you get there,
Charlton?

197
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,343
You can get
to any memory.

198
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,213
You just think on it
and walk outside.

199
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,265
The one you seek, though,
is difficult to find. It's hidden well.

200
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,222
Even from you.

201
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:09,478
It hides in the place you think
of least because you don't wish to.

202
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,643
Why? Because it's so terrible.

203
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,944
Huh. So, just my most repressed
and traumatic memory.

204
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,320
This'll be fun.

205
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,320
Come on, Charlton.

206
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,538
Time to take a walk
down memory lane.

207
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,201
- Wait, wait, wait. Why do I have to come?
- You're coming.

208
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,787
Are you sure this is
the right one?

209
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:32,959
What, you don't trust
the book?

210
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,042
Well, no, it's just,
I've never seen one locked before.

211
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,752
Here.

212
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,601
I'll throw this down for you
in case you change your mind

213
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,457
- and you wanna climb back up.
- Very good.

214
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:15,832
Right.

215
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,719
Well, Alice, I suppose
this is goodbye.

216
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:26,722
I do hope wherever you go is
where you're supposed to be.

217
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,389
Same to you.

218
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,892
Right. Well, here goes.

219
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,752
Hey, 23. Can I get a ride?

220
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,589
I ain't your personal Uber.

221
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,220
I'm back to Earth
after finishing the eggs,

222
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,173
which I'm telling myself
come from a chicken.

223
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:09,101
It'll be real quick.
I just need to get my birthright box.

224
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,520
And I'd love to do that

225
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:13,268
before having to break
the Eliot news to the whole castle.

226
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,065
Because that's not
gonna be a short convo.

227
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,438
Yeah, I'm helping Julia
with a god power thing.

228
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:20,613
You're seriously blowing me off
to score points with your crush?

229
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:23,153
I'm the only one
that can perform the ritual.

230
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,235
You're the one that brought
your fuckboy with you.

231
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:31,533
I brought Josh 'cause we needed
a decent cook. And we're cool.

232
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,625
Just like Julia
and me are cool.

233
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,120
- Cool?
- Cool. So, about that ride.

234
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,000
Thanks for breakfast.

235
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:42,047
High King Margo, you're back.

236
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:44,638
Where's Eliot?

237
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:53,475
Hey, Julia, uh...

238
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,681
Ready to run some diagnostics?

239
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:59,018
- 'Sup, Shoshana?
- Oh. We already ran them.

240
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,065
Oh, uh...

241
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,397
- Okay, what did they say?
- Inconclusive.

242
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,649
Uh, we're looking for
the right ritual to try.

243
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:10,283
But, um, I'm her follower now,
so I can handle it.

244
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,125
- Right, so I'll just...
- Do you happen to know

245
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,669
any diagnostics to run
on pseudo gods or whatever?

246
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,296
Can't say that I do.

247
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:21,590
Mmm. Oh.

248
00:13:21,676 --> 00:13:24,965
So, we're good here, then.

249
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:30,049
Right. I'm gonna bounce.

250
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:33,181
Text me if you, uh,
need a ride, or...

251
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,014
- Something.
- Thanks, Penny.

252
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:42,444
Oh, shit. I totally forgot to ask
if you have any magical wards or cloaks.

253
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,066
They could be interfering.

254
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,274
Uh, yeah, a massive
cloaking spell.

255
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,905
This evil bitch Irene
McAllistair is after me...

256
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,827
Uh, you can't remove it.
I need it.

257
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,075
Oh, crap, I just did.

258
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,705
Uh, just, um, give me
30 seconds. I'll protect you.

259
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,587
Julia.

260
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,464
Check out this bitch.

261
00:14:02,592 --> 00:14:03,592
Iris.

262
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:08,504
What are you doing here?

263
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:11,636
That Monster you let out of
the castle is after me and my friends.

264
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,809
Gods in hiding.
It's so gauche.

265
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:16,683
- But you're gonna help us trap him.
- I'll help you.

266
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,642
If you tell me what I am.

267
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,813
I'm not a human. Not a god.

268
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,732
You're the worst parts
of both.

269
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,319
Helpless as a human,
immortal as a god.

270
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,899
So, everyone you
ever love will die

271
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:33,404
and you're just stuck here
on this stupid rock, alone, forever.

272
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:34,955
Because no one can kill you

273
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:38,409
except for... Oh,
hey, someone exactly like me.

274
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,120
So, listen.
This is a living stone.

275
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,964
Its blood keeps The Monster
from traveling.

276
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,987
Blackspire's made of thousands of these.
That's why it's the perfect prison.

277
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,378
Unless, of course,
someone opens the door.

278
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,597
But the blood can hold him
in place for a few minutes.

279
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,175
So, bleed the stone,
dump the blood on him,

280
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,476
I'll take him
to the castle.

281
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,139
You really need me,
or did you just come here to talk shit?

282
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,813
Gods can't touch the blood.

283
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,941
It fritzes our powers.
Not that that's a problem for you.

284
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,908
I'll be watching.
Once you dump the blood, I'll do the rest.

285
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:15,534
And please, don't
do your usual thing and screw it up.

286
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,914
Okay.
Cloak's back on.

287
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:25,543
What?

288
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:30,177
Do I have a booger?

289
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,512
Oh.

290
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,594
That wasn't as bad
as I expected,

291
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:43,474
considering it was
my first cry as a widow.

292
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,485
Yeah. Just two short hours.

293
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,063
How long did you cry?

294
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,776
When you found out
that Eliot's... That he...

295
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,827
I've been a little busy.

296
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,572
And it seems like
you're good now.

297
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,787
- So, I'm gonna go.
- Wait, Margo.

298
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,161
Margo.

299
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:07,373
High King Margo.

300
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,920
- You're returned.
- And just leaving.

301
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:15,006
Before you do, could you say hello
to Her Slowness, Abigail?

302
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:19,135
She's not herself.
Seeing you might lift her spirits.

303
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,469
What's wrong with her?

304
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,766
She's not speaking.

305
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,478
She hasn't said a word
to me all day.

306
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,393
Rafe.

307
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,568
Come here.

308
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:38,745
So, great, you have each other.
I'm going to find my birthright box.

309
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,334
Look,
not to be a dick,

310
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,083
but, uh, drawing blood
from a stone is a saying for a reason.

311
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:50,007
Yeah, I know.
She wasn't in the mood to elaborate.

312
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,004
Yeah, she was
too busy making threats.

313
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:55,429
Shoshana has her reservations,
but we have no choice, so...

314
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,926
Wait, what reservations?

315
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,536
- Well, Shoshana thinks that...
- Iris can't be trusted. Okay?

316
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,303
That bitch is all sketch.
Bacchus hated her.

317
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,683
Why, did she give him
an intervention?

318
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:07,642
No, he wouldn't say,
and he told me everything.

319
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,442
Okay, look, the point is,

320
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,943
Iris talked him into doing something
a long time ago, okay?

321
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,069
And the fact that he wouldn't
say what it was,

322
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,526
that should be enough
to scare us off.

323
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:21,162
Look, we don't have a choice.
Iris made that damn clear.

324
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,161
- So, if you could help us...
- I am helping.

325
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:24,913
No, Shoshana,
you're getting in the way.

326
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:28,454
No, she's right.
We have to do this.

327
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:33,838
Q, if this works, Eliot will be locked
in Castle Blackspire forever.

328
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,503
Eliot's dead.

329
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,011
And The Monster's
coming back here,

330
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:42,343
so let's figure this out
before he does?

331
00:17:52,947 --> 00:17:53,983
Hey.

332
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,571
Hey.

333
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,821
Penny, right?

334
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,032
I know you?

335
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,594
Well, here it is,
Charlton. My greatest trauma.

336
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,048
Someone put a sheet over you
and wheeled around your strange bed.

337
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:24,222
That's Logan Kinnear.

338
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:25,973
Very deceased.

339
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,434
That's me.

340
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,559
The first time
I ever used magic was...

341
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:35,191
To kill Logan
with that school bus.

342
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,023
That is very fuck.

343
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:40,446
That's still not quite right.

344
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,869
It's more of an adverb.

345
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,073
Anyway, he was a bully.

346
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:49,001
He was the single
worst person in my life.

347
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:52,379
I can't tell you how many times
he made me think about killing myself.

348
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,458
But when I did this,

349
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,128
I became the worst person
in my life.

350
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:03,678
Well, this has been
very therapeutic,

351
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,350
but I'm not seeing
any doors.

352
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:09,437
Is there something
especially painful that you're avoiding?

353
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:15,273
Look at me. I would say
that I am suffering some very special pain.

354
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,483
Well, it's not all bad.

355
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,903
You have a friend
to comfort you.

356
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,911
My only
childhood friend.

357
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,414
Taylor.

358
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,543
Everyone else would
taunt and bully me,

359
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,997
but never Taylor. Never.

360
00:19:37,218 --> 00:19:38,584
Oh, shit.

361
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,920
I think I know
where we need to go.

362
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:45,803
- Bitch.
- Yeah!

363
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,746
You can kick him
harder than that.

364
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:48,830
What,
you wanna kiss boys?

365
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,174
- Queer.
- Kick him.

366
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:51,833
- Faggot.
- Little bitch.

367
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,794
- Let's kick him.
- Come on, kick him.

368
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:56,561
All right, that's enough.

369
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:57,944
He gets the point.

370
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:00,530
Let's go, come on.
Let's go. Out of here.

371
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,857
Let's go. Come on.

372
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:05,865
Hey! Eliot!

373
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:07,783
I said, that's enough.

374
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:10,624
Oh, my...

375
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,580
Come on, Taylor.
Let's go, buddy.

376
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:17,210
Hating myself for who I am
is one thing,

377
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,708
but to hurt somebody else?

378
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:28,140
- Do you see a door?
- None.

379
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,468
Back to the Happy Place?

380
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:37,066
Hey!

381
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:38,773
Hey.

382
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,734
You got to get a visitor's pass
from the front office.

383
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,378
Oh, my God, it worked.

384
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,260
Fantastic news.

385
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,141
Ow! Oh, God.

386
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:13,563
What are you doing?

387
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,810
Uh, reading.

388
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:18,151
Hmm.

389
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,063
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

390
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,529
You are so boring sometimes.

391
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,158
Look what I found.

392
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:32,413
How did you do that?

393
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,992
I went to Mesopotamia,
like you told me to.

394
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,251
I never said...

395
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:38,857
It's really quite different
than I remember,

396
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:40,338
and I couldn't find
anything useful.

397
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,837
I got so frustrated
I almost broke it.

398
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:46,591
But when I pick it up
and focus my power into it,

399
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:48,967
this happens.

400
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,389
What does it say?

401
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,559
We could look those up.
The symbols.

402
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,637
- Really? How?
- Books.

403
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:55,814
Books.

404
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:58,140
- There's a library here.
- Library.

405
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:00,859
Or we can take
a field trip.

406
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:02,106
- Field trip.
- To...

407
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,801
Brakebills. We could take
a field trip to Brakebills.

408
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:08,192
They have a huge library.

409
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:09,943
Field trip to...

410
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,370
- Tons of books.
- Brakebills.

411
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:18,915
Holy dick shit!

412
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,088
- What are you doing?
- The Last Lay.

413
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:24,215
The widow lays
in her marital bed

414
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,884
buried in the garments
of her deceased love.

415
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,716
I was worried. You weren't
at the bare-breasted laments.

416
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:33,224
Yeah? My boobs can lament
just fine covered, thanks.

417
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:35,216
Can we get
the locksmith up here?

418
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,599
Everyone's gone for the day.

419
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,142
The whole staff is gone?

420
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:41,229
Except for the carpenters building
the Altar of Remembrance.

421
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:02,922
Hi, Quentin.

422
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,631
I need to tell you something.
Can I come in?

423
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,301
- Uh, no.
- Fine.

424
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,347
- I was in the Library...
- Of course you were.

425
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:17,678
Don't be a shit.

426
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,270
They locked me up, okay?

427
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,268
But I escaped,

428
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,566
and I changed our books
so that they can't track us.

429
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,694
And when I was reading your book,
I read the end.

430
00:23:27,323 --> 00:23:29,155
Q, you die in two days.

431
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:31,988
Why should I believe you?

432
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:39,408
You're bleeding a living stone, right?
To kill The Monster?

433
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,565
You spend two whole days
bleeding it,

434
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,751
and when you finally douse him with it,
he kills you.

435
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:48,758
Look, I'm not here
to scare you.

436
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,209
I'm just here to tell you to forget
the plan and run now.

437
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:54,256
If we don't trap The Monster,
Iris kills Julia.

438
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:59,061
So, thank you for the information,
but I'm not bailing on her.

439
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,512
It's your life, Q.

440
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:01,722
What if I beat the book?

441
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:05,184
It says it takes two days.
What if I bleed it faster than that?

442
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,938
Any changes to the book
can have a ripple effect.

443
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,822
Maybe it would work.

444
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:16,911
I can't do it any faster,
so if you care to help, um...

445
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,710
I hate books.

446
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,421
Let's go back
to the apartment.

447
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:34,470
Nope, sorry. If we wanna
find it, it's gonna be here.

448
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:37,684
This is it.

449
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,476
- You found it?
- Yes.

450
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:41,562
- No.
- No?

451
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,018
Yes?

452
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:47,976
This game is confusing.

453
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,856
- Which is it?
- Yes.

454
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:54,442
We found something.
It's just the wrong thing.

455
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:56,367
It's just totally wrong.

456
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,907
I'm sorry.

457
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:09,790
I really hate books.

458
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,310
Okay.

459
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:23,603
This is the inscription,
but we're trying to stall him.

460
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,180
I thought I was helping.

461
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:28,312
I know. Look, you should
go help Q at the apartment.

462
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:30,815
Please let me stay.
I'll stall him, I'll shut up,

463
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,645
I'll do whatever
you want, just...

464
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:34,864
He already took
Bacchus from me.

465
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,987
I couldn't stand losing
another god to him.

466
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,073
Okay. Just stay out
of the way, got it?

467
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:41,988
Yes, yes, my goddess.
Yes.

468
00:25:43,417 --> 00:25:44,457
This is too many.

469
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,660
If I cut it down anymore,
we're chopping bone.

470
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,503
Any one of these
could have the door.

471
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:49,869
Or a creature
waiting to kill us.

472
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,210
It's really best
if we stay here.

473
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:55,840
No, I have to let my friends
know I'm still in here.

474
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,799
We have to go back.

475
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,382
Whatever you say,
Jack Shephard.

476
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:05,554
Was that a <i>Lost</i> reference?

477
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,083
You watched it all
one week over Christmas.

478
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,975
I stayed in that memory for a while.
What did you think of the finale?

479
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,150
Stay on task, Charlton.

480
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:14,111
How do we survive visiting
all of these memories?

481
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:16,801
The large man in the short pants
was quite awful, wasn't he?

482
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,985
- That's what we need.
- More large men in short pants?

483
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,370
Even better.

484
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:24,956
Charlton,
meet my friends.

485
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,622
Quentin, from the time
I convinced him to fight Penny.

486
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:31,504
Fen, who was ready to fight
pirates at a moment's notice.

487
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,502
And Margo,
the Welters captain.

488
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,710
No force in heaven
or on Earth is more terrifying.

489
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,887
If you pathetic
sons of bitches

490
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:42,682
aren't crying blood
by the time this is over...

491
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:43,768
Okay, okay.

492
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,969
Save it for the creatures
that you'll be fighting

493
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:49,852
while I look for a door back
to my body located in one of these.

494
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:53,606
Every memory, I've shoved
to a dark corner of my mind.

495
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:56,733
Because being self-aware
and happy don't always mix.

496
00:26:57,407 --> 00:27:00,275
Let's start with
the Embarrassments Minora.

497
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:05,284
The worst haircut
of my life.

498
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:15,544
I'm sorry.

499
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:18,335
He's just a little shy.

500
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:23,427
Are you serious right now?

501
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,246
Well, it's not like this
has ever happened before.

502
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:30,184
Failing that, we move on
to the darker stuff.

503
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:31,515
All right, let's do this.

504
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,937
Welcome to the
Physical Kids cottage.

505
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:37,733
I sleep with people's
boyfriends.

506
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:58,546
I've betrayed my friends
by accident.

507
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:01,010
Go left, go left.

508
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:12,722
And on purpose.

509
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,068
Guards.

510
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:18,982
No, Eliot.

511
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:21,440
- Take her to the dungeon.
- No!

512
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:23,817
Eliot...

513
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:29,322
God damn it.

514
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,408
There's still no
fucking doors.

515
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,288
I was feeling really
good about those.

516
00:28:33,587 --> 00:28:34,873
Brace yourselves, everyone.

517
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,250
It's daddy issues and dicks
from here on out.

518
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,295
They're here.

519
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,046
Run. Run.

520
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:50,278
You ever tango with
a knife maker's daughter?

521
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:51,479
Come at me!

522
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:53,898
I got this!

523
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,610
Your face looks
like a scrotum!

524
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:02,365
Go!

525
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,902
You bargain-basement creature!

526
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,340
Get some towels.

527
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,355
- Is it bad?
- Don't look.

528
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,843
- Fuck.
- You got it right.

529
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:29,931
Yeah.

530
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:43,154
That should do it.

531
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:48,155
It just needs to drain and...
For a minute or two.

532
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:52,243
You can, uh, leave now.

533
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:56,034
Uh, when Julia gets out
of the Brakebills ward,

534
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:58,996
she'll text me
and I'll meet her in the park.

535
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:01,877
Then we trap The Monster today,
not in two days. So we're good.

536
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,459
Deathly fate averted.

537
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:05,885
I should be there with you

538
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,824
just in case what happens
in the book starts happening.

539
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:10,386
I'm about to kill my friend.
It's a monster, I know,

540
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,138
but it's a monster with his face
and eyes and I'm just...

541
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:16,642
I don't have space
for us right now.

542
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,098
I'm not asking you to!

543
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:25,650
"A dog approached,
wanting to play.

544
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:30,242
"The owner followed to talk to Quentin,
distracting him.

545
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:31,536
"And in that moment,

546
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:34,238
"The Monster saw
the stone's blood and Quentin,

547
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:37,742
"and with a mere thought,
sliced him apart,

548
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:41,337
"so ending the story
of Quentin Coldwater."

549
00:30:43,425 --> 00:30:46,714
I didn't come here to make up with you.
I came here to save your life.

550
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,509
I'm just trying to figure out how to fix
this mountain of shit that I've created.

551
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:53,846
Well, it's gonna take
a lot more than just my life.

552
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,025
I sent Christopher Plover
to the Poison World.

553
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,312
I figure that should give me
some points in my favor.

554
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:07,442
You what?

555
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,491
Well, I was supposed to
send him to a peaceful world,

556
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,930
but I thought that maybe he would
do something to a little kid and...

557
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,640
And you know what,
he doesn't deserve peace.

558
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:16,530
Oh, my God.

559
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,497
Sorry, I'm back where you were
confessing to murdering

560
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:21,898
my favorite
children's book author.

561
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:26,132
- And, yeah, I know, he's evil, but it's...
- So, does that make me good?

562
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:29,461
Does killing him
make me better or worse?

563
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,264
I don't know.

564
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:37,768
I am trying.

565
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:41,018
Okay, Quentin?
I am always trying.

566
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:46,770
So, if you have some recipe
for perfect redemption, just tell me.

567
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:50,323
Because I can't change the way
that you feel, so just...

568
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,951
There's a spell...

569
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:01,579
Okay, there's a spell
in here that...

570
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:04,518
That will tell me
where I'm supposed to go.

571
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:07,715
So, just let me come with you
and then do this spell with me.

572
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:09,918
And then wherever
it says to go, I'll go,

573
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:12,628
and I will stay there for good, okay?
Just let me help you.

574
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,845
Wherever it says?

575
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,560
Do you promise?

576
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:27,522
I promise.

577
00:32:30,532 --> 00:32:33,821
Do whatever you gotta do.
Just get it open.

578
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,663
This seems rash,
even for you.

579
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:43,201
Well, like my ex always said,
"I'll be happy once that box is open."

580
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:46,170
Margo, have you cried yet?
For Eliot?

581
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:48,748
Fen, I'm only gonna
say this once.

582
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:52,590
Me joining your sad-face
therapy party is dumb.

583
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:57,140
Because I can't cry out
all the sadness, ever.

584
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:03,973
Because if I start,
I'll never stop, understand?

585
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,316
I'll be useless forever.

586
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:11,650
And somebody has
to rule this kingdom,

587
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,608
and I will be God damned
if I drop the ball

588
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:17,364
'cause I was too busy lamenting
with my tits out, all right?

589
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:21,531
Your Majesty.

590
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:23,366
With deep regret,
I must inform you,

591
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:27,086
the royal sheep choir,
they've gone silent, too.

592
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,942
But we need them
for the memorial.

593
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,919
Who else will sing
the <i>Bleats of Despair?</i>

594
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:33,463
High King Margo.

595
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,395
A talking lizard
of the Dunes.

596
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:47,394
I've only ever read
about these.

597
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:50,898
Well, what's my birthright,
you scaly shit?

598
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,492
It's the talking animals.

599
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,865
They've all been struck dumb.

600
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:05,116
Well, shit.
All right, Fen.

601
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,287
I think I will do a ritual. Earth specialty.
The sleep of solitude.

602
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,919
I pop an Ambien,
everyone leaves me alone till noon.

603
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,465
That'll be perfect.

604
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,223
Hmm.

605
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,548
I never asked.

606
00:34:21,268 --> 00:34:23,555
When you found
your door, um,

607
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:27,021
what memory was it?

608
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:31,810
The day that I left home.

609
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:33,853
That's it?

610
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,448
- That's your most traumatic memory?
- Yes.

611
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:41,361
Because I left... Home.

612
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:45,164
But it was when you were confronted
with what you fear most.

613
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,334
Great.

614
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:53,506
So, just figure out what that is
and I'll make a distraction,

615
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,800
and then you can go there.

616
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:58,128
I know you're just a memory,

617
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,008
but you're a very
generous one.

618
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:04,842
Well, you sacrifice
for people you love.

619
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:08,137
Oh, shit.

620
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,440
I get it.

621
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:15,945
Q, I'm gonna
take you up on that.

622
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:24,199
Lead the creatures
to my puberty. Go bravely.

623
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,614
Okay.

624
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,629
I know where I need to go.

625
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:39,294
Did it happen?

626
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,803
Fifty years.

627
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:46,141
It happened.

628
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,390
Okay, so, they should be
coming from there.

629
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:56,728
I'll stand here. He'll come to me,
and then you drench him.

630
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,281
It was sort of beautiful.

631
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,401
It really was.

632
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:07,538
I know this sounds dumb,
but us... We...

633
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,708
You know, think about it.
Like, we work.

634
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:18,800
And we know it 'cause we've lived it.
Who gets that kind of proof of concept?

635
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:27,304
We were just injected with
a half-century of emotion,

636
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:30,558
so I get that maybe
you're not thinking clearly.

637
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:34,015
No, I'm just saying,
what if we gave it a shot?

638
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:38,561
I mean, would that be
that crazy?

639
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:44,234
Why the fuck not?

640
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:51,157
I know you and you aren't...

641
00:36:51,251 --> 00:36:53,459
- What's it matter?
- Don't be naive. It matters.

642
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:57,459
Q, come on. I love you,

643
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:01,171
but you have to know
that that's not me

644
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:02,752
and that's definitely
not you,

645
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:05,304
not when we have a choice.

646
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:10,225
Okay. I...

647
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,810
Okay.

648
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:15,481
Sorry, I...

649
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,937
What the hell
is wrong with you?

650
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:23,693
And what the hell
are you doing?

651
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,029
Q, the dog.

652
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:35,660
- Hi.
- Sorry about him.

653
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,356
Train them all you want,
they're still gonna do

654
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,483
- what they're gonna do, you know?
- Mmm-hmm.

655
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:40,623
You have a dog?

656
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:42,458
Q, she's the distraction.

657
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:45,511
No. Right, sorry,
I got... Uh...

658
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,133
All right, man.

659
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,056
Okay.

660
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:52,788
Q, I'm gonna pour the blood on him, okay?
You just run right now, please.

661
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,678
No, look,
stick to the plan. Go.

662
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,430
They're coming.

663
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,857
Someone good
and true loves you.

664
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:03,563
And he went out
on a limb.

665
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:07,108
And, yeah, it was
a little crazy, but you knew.

666
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,948
You knew this was a moment
that truly mattered

667
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:11,245
and you just snuffed it out.

668
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:24,091
Q, I'm sorry.

669
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,048
I was afraid.

670
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,595
And when I'm afraid,
I run away.

671
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:56,122
If I ever get out
of here, Q,

672
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:57,370
know that when I'm braver

673
00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:00,123
it's 'cause I learned it
from you.

674
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:07,627
Quentin.

675
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:31,567
Q.

676
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,322
Q.

677
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:41,335
It's me. It's Eliot.

678
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:46,170
- Okay, no games, come on. Let's just go.
- It's Eliot.

679
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:48,087
No, bullshit. Come on.

680
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:50,010
Fifty years.

681
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,347
- Who gets proof of concept like that?
- What?

682
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:56,641
Peaches and plums,
motherfucker.

683
00:39:57,604 --> 00:39:58,970
I'm alive in here.

684
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:01,104
Eliot.

685
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:04,775
No.

686
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,118
Did it work?

687
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:22,285
I hope so.

688
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:28,131
You fucked it up.
I warned you.

689
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:30,668
No!
Wait, don't!

690
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:34,681
Look what you did.

691
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:36,642
Iris.

692
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:39,760
Fancy seeing you here.

693
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,564
I'd like it back now.

694
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,985
I'm sorry.

695
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,074
You tried to trick me.

696
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,951
No. No, it wasn't...

697
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:01,990
The plan worked,
right, Q?

698
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:04,205
Who is this now?

699
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,161
Right, the plan...
We...

700
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:07,881
We got Iris for you.

701
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:10,583
We couldn't tell you
because she was watching,

702
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:12,678
but we did it.

703
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:17,885
This was all just
a plan for me?

704
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:20,763
Yeah.

705
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,769
Yeah, yeah.

706
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:24,855
And here's the best part.

707
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:28,851
We didn't wanna show you
till you had the piece from Iris.

708
00:41:28,945 --> 00:41:30,311
According to this,

709
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,821
uh, all those organs,

710
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:34,732
they're building blocks

711
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:37,777
trying to piece together
a body.

712
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:40,783
Is it yours?

713
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,920
Impressive.

714
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,706
Eliot's alive.

715
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,668
- What?
- He's alive.

716
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:04,970
Any minute now.

717
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:17,115
I was just about
to leave...

718
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,742
Does she know that
I just saved your life?

719
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:25,700
No. I never thanked you
for that.

720
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:30,462
He made me hesitate,
and if I hadn't, Eliot would be gone.

721
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:36,636
If The Monster's building a body,
maybe there's a way that we can save him.

722
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,546
I can help.

723
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,097
Just let me stay.

724
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:46,099
You saved my life.
You can save my life 50 times.

725
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:50,141
It's not gonna change
anything between us.

726
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:53,352
I loved you.

727
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,236
But you couldn't trust that.

728
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:11,287
It's done.

729
00:43:23,351 --> 00:43:25,513
Goodbye, Alice.
