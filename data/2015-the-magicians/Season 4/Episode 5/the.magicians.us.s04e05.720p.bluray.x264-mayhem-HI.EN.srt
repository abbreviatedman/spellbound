That's not quite right.

177
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:57,679
And I told her that when you die here,
you're gone forever.

178
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:00,978
But she just had to try and find her door,
and pray imagine what befell her?

179
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:02,730
Devoured by creatures.

180
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,687
Flesh rent from her bones,
skin torn from her skull.

181
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:08,520
She died staring
at her own face held before her.

182
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,069
- That is awful.
- Yeah.

183
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:14,988
What's this about a door?

184
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,694
(PLOVER WHISTLING)

185
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,387
- Could you not, please?
- (STOPS WHISTLING)

186
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:23,876
What, no time for cheer?

187
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,461
We escaped the Library, safe.

188
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,793
You hid your friends.
They're safe, too.

189
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,340
Yeah, well, not Quentin.

190
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:33,427
And what exactly
are you gonna do about it, hmm?

191
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,879
Besides scowl?

192
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,555
Save him.

193
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,179
Warn him, I don't know.
I don't owe you an answer.

194
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:40,677
You wanna know
what I think?

195
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,181
Jesus God, never.

196
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:45,856
I think we need to cast another spell
on that book for you.

197
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,935
I know exactly where I need to go.
Quentin's book showed me where he is.

198
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:50,895
And he only has
a couple days left.

199
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:53,356
Oh. So, you trust one book
and not the other.

200
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,691
That's funny.

201
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,973
There's only one place I can
try to make things right.

Word of advice,
'cause I can see you need it,

204
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,334
apologize for what you've done, fine,
but never for who you are.

'Cause you'll never be able
to change that. So, why pretend?

206

aren't we?

207
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,472

All I need
is one moment

210
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:28,232
to find my friends
and tell them I'm alive. Help me.

211
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,356
Or I'm kicking you
out of the Happy Place.

212
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:34,109
- I can do that. Right?
- Yeah.

213
00:09:37,327 --> 00:09:39,068
There's a door somewhere.

214
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,538
(CLEARS THROAT) Hidden deep
in a forgotten remembrance.

215
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,035
Forgotten remembrance?

216
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,005
For me, it was the door
to my childhood bedroom.

217
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,619
But not part
of the memory.

218
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,838
- Just there.
- What memory?

219
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,757
How did you get there,
Charlton?

220
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,343
You can get
to any memory.

221
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,213
You just think on it
and walk outside.

222
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,265
The one you seek, though,
is difficult to find. It's hidden well.

223
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,222
Even from you.

224
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:09,478
It hides in the place you think
of least because you don't wish to.

225
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,643
Why? Because it's so terrible.

226
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,944
Huh. So, just my most repressed
and traumatic memory.

227
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,320
This'll be fun.

228
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,320
Come on, Charlton.

229
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:24,538
Time to take a walk
down memory lane.

230
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:28,201
- Wait, wait, wait. Why do I have to come?
- You're coming.

231
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,787
Are you sure this is
the right one?

232
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:32,959
What, you don't trust
the book?

233
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,042
Well, no, it's just,
I've never seen one locked before.

234
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,752
Here.

Well, Alice, I suppose
this is goodbye.

where you're supposed to be.

I ain't your personal Uber.

which I'm telling myself
come from a chicken.

251

It'll be real quick.
I just need to get my birthright box.

And I'd love to do that

before having to break
the Eliot news to the whole castle.

254

Because that's not
gonna be a short convo.

Yeah, I'm helping Julia
with a god power thing.

256
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:20,613
You're seriously blowing me off
to score points with your crush?

257

I'm the only one
that can perform the ritual.

You're the one that brought
your fuckboy with you.

I brought Josh 'cause we needed
a decent cook. And we're cool.

Just like Julia
and me are cool.

- Cool?
- Cool. So, about that ride.

- Okay, what did they say?
- Inconclusive.

the right ritual to try.

so I can handle it.

- Right, so I'll just...
- Do you happen to know

00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,669
any diagnostics to run
on pseudo gods or whatever?

need a ride, or...

- Something.
- Thanks, Penny.

280

Oh, shit. I totally forgot to ask
if you have any magical wards or cloaks.

00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,066

- But you're gonna help us trap him.
- I'll help you.

294

If you tell me what I am.

295
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,813
I'm not a human. Not a god.

296
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:23,732
You're the worst parts
of both.

immortal as a god.

So, everyone you
ever love will die

00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:33,404
and you're just stuck here
on this stupid rock, alone, forever.

except for... Oh,
hey, someone exactly like me.

302
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,120
So, listen.
This is a living stone.

303
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,964
Its blood keeps The Monster
from traveling.

304
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,987
Blackspire's made of thousands of these.
That's why it's the perfect prison.

305
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,378
Unless, of course,
someone opens the door.

306
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,597
But the blood can hold him
in place for a few minutes.

307
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,175
So, bleed the stone,
dump the blood on him,

308
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,476
I'll take him
to the castle.

309
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,139
You really need me,
or did you just come here to talk shit?

310
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,813
Gods can't touch the blood.

311
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,941
It fritzes our powers.
Not that that's a problem for you.

312
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,908
I'll be watching.
Once you dump the blood, I'll do the rest.

313
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:15,534
And please, don't
do your usual thing and screw it up.

314

(EXHALES) Okay.

Oh. (CHUCKLES)

319
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,594
That wasn't as bad
as I expected,

320
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:43,474
considering it was
my first cry as a widow.

321
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:46,485
Yeah. Just two short hours.

322
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,063
How long did you cry?

323
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,776
When you found out
that Eliot's... That he...

324
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,827
I've been a little busy.

325
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,572
And it seems like
you're good now.

326
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,787
- So, I'm gonna go.
- Wait, Margo.

327
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,161
Margo.

328
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:07,373
High King Margo.

329
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,920
- You're returned.
- And just leaving.

330
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:15,006
Before you do, could you say hello
to Her Slowness, Abigail?

331
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:19,135
She's not herself.
Seeing you might lift her spirits.

332
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,469
What's wrong with her?

333
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,766
She's not speaking.

334
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,478
She hasn't said a word
to me all day.

335
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,393
Rafe.

336
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,568
Come here.

337
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:38,745
So, great, you have each other.
I'm going to find my birthright box.

338
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:44,334
QUENTIN: Look,
not to be a dick,

339
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,083
but, uh, drawing blood
from a stone is a saying for a reason.

340
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:50,007
Yeah, I know.
She wasn't in the mood to elaborate.

341
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,004
Yeah, she was
too busy making threats.

342
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:55,429
Shoshana has her reservations,
but we have no choice, so...

343
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,926
Wait, what reservations?

344
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,536
- Well, Shoshana thinks that...
- Iris can't be trusted. Okay?

345
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,303
That bitch is all sketch.
