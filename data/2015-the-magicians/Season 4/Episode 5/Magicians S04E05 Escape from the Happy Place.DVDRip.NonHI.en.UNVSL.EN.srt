00:00:00,934 --> 00:00:02,562
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,636 --> 00:00:04,798
Will you play with me? No!

3
00:00:04,872 --> 00:00:06,238
You do remember me, don't you?

4
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:08,468
I'm Christopher... Plover.

5
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:10,306
<i>You were looking for your book.</i>

6
00:00:10,377 --> 00:00:12,846
<i>Yours and your friends' books
are in the Revision Room.</i>

7
00:00:12,913 --> 00:00:15,075
<i>But I happen to
know where that is.</i>

8
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:17,549
The end of Quentin's
book. He's going to die.

9
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:19,416
Isn't that how all books end?

10
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:20,784
His ends next week.

11
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:24,950
Your birthright box, which it
has been my honor to guard,

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,989
dictated your absence from
the kingdom and your return.

13
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,389
We need your help, Shoshana.

14
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:34,096
I have a new deity to follow.

15
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:37,399
<i>The Poison Room fountain
has a stack of books for a statue.</i>

16
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:39,782
<i>So, if we find the right fountain...</i>
ALICE: <i>We can walk right in.</i>

17
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:42,503
<i>When you get back what
the gods took from you,</i>

18
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:45,375
could I maybe have Eliot back?

19
00:00:45,812 --> 00:00:50,216
<i>You were friends with
Eliot. Very best friends.</i>

20
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:53,345
You should know that
your friend Eliot is dead.

21
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:55,918
<i>I felt the moment his soul died.</i>

22
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:58,619
Or he's trapped in there.

23
00:00:58,692 --> 00:01:00,524
<i>Forced to watch everything
The Monster does,</i>

24
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:03,530
<i>just waiting for us to
find a way to help him.</i>

25
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,592
<i>Hello?</i>

26
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:12,868
There's one thing

27
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,035
every resident of the Physical
Kids cottage must know.

28
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:17,844
Where the bathroom is.

29
00:01:18,278 --> 00:01:19,974
How to make... How to make...

30
00:01:20,347 --> 00:01:22,692
our signature cocktail. How
to make our signature cocktail.

31
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:23,916
That's what I was trying to...

32
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:25,044
That's what I meant to say.

33
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:27,914
Oh.

34
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:30,018
Now you can make it on your own.

35
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:34,725
Should I get that?

36
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:40,163
Rather not.

37
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,502
Ah!

38
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,767
There you are. Here I am.

39
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:49,236
Sorry, I had to interrupt
an orgy upstairs.

40
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:51,001
You broke up the orgy?

41
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:54,242
No, I told them there was a
bigger room two doors down.

42
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:55,907
Mmm. Mmm.

43
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:59,776
Now, I don't say this lightly,

44
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:02,413
but I think this might
be our best party yet.

45
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:05,917
And I say this with the
weight of my whole heart.

46
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:07,587
I concur.

47
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:11,992
I'll get it. Don't.

48
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:15,160
Whoever is that desperate
to come in can't be fun.

49
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,940
Oh.

50
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:23,774
What do you like
most about summer?

51
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:25,039
Mmm...

52
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,106
Nothing.

53
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:28,876
You don't like summer?

54
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,517
No.

55
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:36,418
Nothing's what I
love about summer.

56
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:39,016
No class, no people,

57
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,929
just beautiful nothing.

58
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:46,395
No.

59
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:50,068
Go make me a drink.

60
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,833
Okay.

61
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,508
I'm Eliot, by the way.

62
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:58,840
Uh-oh.

63
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,642
That's... Eliot's my name, too.

64
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,378
Well, that can't be.
What's your middle name?

65
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,077
Um...

66
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:07,153
Todd?

67
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:10,381
Should I get that?

68
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:12,392
Never answer a cop knock.

69
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,556
Beautiful nothing.

70
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,960
Now that's the
kind of man I need.

71
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:26,172
Don't answer it. Then
we have to talk to them.

72
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,868
Oh, come on. I just
want to see who it is.

73
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,744
No, you can't come in.

74
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:37,079
Well, I'm sorry, but that
sounds like a you problem.

75
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:39,418
Margo!

76
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,013
Margo!

77
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,360
Eliot!

78
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,703
Inside. Inside, we
must go inside... What?

79
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:57,863
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no. Do
we know you? They're coming.

80
00:03:57,938 --> 00:04:02,000
Let me inside, please. I won't harm her.
This is only for your urgent attention.

81
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:05,668
Yeah, I'm not worried
about you harming her.

82
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:15,013
But you make a
point. Uh, let's go.

83
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,094
Are you done being sad now?

84
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,461
I need your help. No, I'm not.

85
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:34,064
Is this about your friend?

86
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:36,638
Because that's not a problem.

87
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:38,578
I'm your friend.

88
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:41,281
He's gone, but I'm here.

89
00:04:41,515 --> 00:04:42,915
Same number of friends.

90
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:46,180
So...

91
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:51,657
What is this?

92
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:54,319
How am I supposed to know?

93
00:04:54,828 --> 00:04:57,491
I would like for you
to be helpful, Quentin.

94
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,160
It's...

95
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:02,702
Really old?

96
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,071
Like
beginning-of-civilization old.

97
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,231
And where was that?

98
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:09,140
Mesopotamia was the first...

99
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:12,475
That's very helpful, thank you. I
will see you back at the apartment.

100
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:29,422
So spacious.

101
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,850
Mine wasn't
nearly half this size.

102
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,328
What's with the...

103
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:37,335
That out there, is it...

104
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:41,774
Sorry, I'm at a loss for
words, which is new for me.

105
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,140
I'm sure you're quite flummoxed.

106
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,473
Sit, sit, sit.

107
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:48,239
Well, the good news, a
monster possessed you

108
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:49,681
and is inhabiting your body.

109
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:52,384
What? He normally
tears people to shreds,

110
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:53,943
so, believe me,
this is preferable.

111
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,097
And when he possessed you...

112
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:56,555
he thrust all of you

113
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:59,486
to this nook of your mind that
holds all your remembrances.

114
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:01,461
Everything here
is a remembrance.

115
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:03,920
Even your friend here.

116
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:07,565
Now, do me a favor.
Imagine she's not here.

117
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,606
What the fuck? Tell me.

118
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,454
I've been trying
to understand it.

119
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:19,571
I just can't figure it out.

120
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:21,006
What is "fuck"?

121
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:27,018
Well, um, it's sort of, like,
a chameleon of a word.

122
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:30,481
Wait, um... Who are you?

123
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:31,684
Oh. Uh...

124
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:33,921
Well, I'm Charlton.

125
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:37,991
Now, I have repressed
many memories,

126
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,557
but I would never forget
somebody named Charlton.

127
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:43,126
Thank you. Not a compliment.

128
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:46,667
I'm not a memory. I once was
possessed by The Monster, too.

129
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,342
I was in my memory
for... It's hard to say.

130
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,936
That's it. I'm pretty
sure I shot you.

131
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:54,276
Or your body, at least.

132
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:55,979
Sorry.

133
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,449
No bother.

134
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,353
It was The Monster's
longer than it was mine.

135
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,117
And I have quite enjoyed
the change of scenery.

136
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,881
This is what I call
your Happy Place.

137
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,188
All your pleasant
remembrances live here.

138
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:12,426
It's very easy to get content
and lose track of time. And reality.

139
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,928
So, you're here to break me out.

140
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,894
My knight in drab armor.

141
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:20,236
No, that would be
ridiculous. We stay here.

142
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:24,301
We don't. I'm taking my
body back. No, no, no.

143
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,077
This is the only place
the creatures can't come.

144
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,481
We can't... Oh. Right.

145
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,950
The scary shrieky
things that live outside.

146
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,982
What are they? The
Monster's other hosts.

147
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,250
Inmates from the Castle.

148
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:41,227
Horrible, wretched mistakes
of the gods, all of them.

149
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,229
Yeah, but if this
is all my memory,

150
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,776
then they can't
really hurt us, right?

151
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,933
Would you care to
ask the Knight Ora?

152
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,366
She was here before you.

153
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:49,869
I would, actually.
Well, you can't.

154
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,802
Because she's dead. Dead fuck.

155
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:54,199
That's not quite right.

156
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:57,711
And I told her that when you
die here, you're gone forever.

157
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:00,975
But she just had to try and find her
door, and pray imagine what befell her?

158
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:02,746
Devoured by creatures.

159
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:05,713
Flesh rent from her bones,
skin torn from her skull.

160
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,516
She died staring at her
own face held before her.

161
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,092
That is awful. Yeah.

162
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:14,991
What's this about a door?

163
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,227
Could you not, please?

164
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:23,867
What, no time for cheer?

165
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,473
We escaped the Library, safe.

166
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,799
You hid your friends.
They're safe, too.

167
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,343
Yeah, well, not Quentin.

168
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,446
And what exactly are you
gonna do about it, hmm?

169
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,879
Besides scowl?

170
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,577
Save him.

171
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:39,175
Warn him, I don't know. I
don't owe you an answer.

172
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:40,715
You wanna know what I think?

173
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:42,221
Jesus God, never.

174
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:45,884
I think we need to cast another
spell on that book for you.

175
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,952
I know exactly where I need to go.
Quentin's book showed me where he is.

176
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:50,921
And he only has
a couple days left.

177
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,364
Oh. So, you trust one
book and not the other.

178
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,697
That's funny.

179
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,981
There's only one place I
can try to make things right.

180
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,371
Redemption arc.

181
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:03,340
Word of advice, 'cause
I can see you need it,

182
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,341
apologize for what you've done,
fine, but never for who you are.

183
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:09,110
'Cause you'll never be able to
change that. So, why pretend?

184
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:16,117
We're getting closer, aren't we?

185
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:18,452
Just a few fountains away.

186
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:24,331
All I need is one moment

187
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:28,232
to find my friends and tell
them I'm alive. Help me.

188
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:31,371
Or I'm kicking you
out of the Happy Place.

189
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:34,101
I can do that. Right? Yeah.

190
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,073
There's a door somewhere.

191
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:42,546
Hidden deep in a
forgotten remembrance.

192
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,047
Forgotten remembrance?

193
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:45,997
For me, it was the door
to my childhood bedroom.

194
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,619
But not part of the memory.

195
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,858
Just there. What memory?

196
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,757
How did you get there, Charlton?

197
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,320
You can get to any memory.

198
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:59,228
You just think on
it and walk outside.

199
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:02,263
The one you seek, though, is
difficult to find. It's hidden well.

200
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,236
Even from you.

201
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:09,475
It hides in the place you think of
least because you don't wish to.

202
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:12,635
Why? Because it's so terrible.

203
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:16,948
Huh. So, just my most
repressed and traumatic memory.

204
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,309
This'll be fun.

205
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,320
Come on, Charlton.

206
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,557
Time to take a walk
down memory lane.

207
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:28,186
Wait, wait, wait. Why do I
have to come? You're coming.

208
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:30,793
Are you sure this
is the right one?

209
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:32,999
What, you don't trust the book?

210
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:36,059
Well, no, it's just, I've never
seen one locked before.

211
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,763
Here.

212
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:07,610
I'll throw this down for you
in case you change your mind

213
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:09,466
and you wanna climb
back up. Very good.

214
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:15,834
Right.

215
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,707
Well, Alice, I suppose
this is goodbye.

216
00:11:21,948 --> 00:11:26,716
I do hope wherever you go is
where you're supposed to be.

217
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,381
Same to you.

218
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:30,883
Right. Well, here goes.

219
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,741
Hey, 23. Can I get a ride?

220
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,583
I ain't your personal Uber.

221
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,254
I'm back to Earth
after finishing the eggs,

222
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,190
which I'm telling myself
come from a chicken.

223
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:09,093
It'll be real quick. I just
need to get my birthright box.

224
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:10,529
And I'd love to do that

225
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:13,294
before having to break the
Eliot news to the whole castle.

226
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:15,062
Because that's not
gonna be a short convo.

227
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:17,430
Yeah, I'm helping Julia
with a god power thing.

228
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,606
You're seriously blowing me off
to score points with your crush?

229
00:12:21,374 --> 00:12:23,172
I'm the only one that
can perform the ritual.

230
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,235
You're the one that brought
your fuckboy with you.

231
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:31,547
I brought Josh 'cause we needed
a decent cook. And we're cool.

232
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,614
Just like Julia and me are cool.

233
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,120
Cool? Cool. So, about that ride.

234
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,023
Thanks for breakfast.

235
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:42,061
High King Margo, you're back.

236
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,630
Where's Eliot?

237
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:53,466
Hey, Julia, uh...

238
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,672
Ready to run some diagnostics?

239
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:59,002
'Sup, Shoshana? Oh.
We already ran them.

240
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:01,077
Oh, uh...

241
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:03,412
Okay, what did they
say? Inconclusive.

242
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,684
Uh, we're looking for
the right ritual to try.

243
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:10,281
But, um, I'm her follower
now, so I can handle it.

244
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,125
Right, so I'll just... Do
you happen to know

245
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:17,652
any diagnostics to run on
pseudo gods or whatever?

246
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:20,291
Can't say that I do.

247
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:21,595
Mmm. Oh.

248
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:24,968
So, we're good here, then.

249
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,067
Right. I'm gonna bounce.

250
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:33,170
Text me if you,
uh, need a ride, or...

251
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:37,008
Something. Thanks, Penny.

252
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:42,453
Oh, shit. I totally forgot to ask if you
have any magical wards or cloaks.

253
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:44,081
They could be interfering.

254
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:46,285
Uh, yeah, a massive
cloaking spell.

255
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:48,919
This evil bitch Irene
McAllistair is after me...

256
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,861
Uh, you can't
remove it. I need it.

257
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,092
Oh, crap, I just did.

258
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,694
Uh, just, um, give me 30
seconds. I'll protect you.

259
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:00,604
Julia.

260
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,475
Check out this bitch.

261
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:03,608
Iris.

262
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:08,546
What are you doing here?

263
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:11,641
That Monster you let out of the
castle is after me and my friends.

264
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,812
Gods in hiding. It's so gauche.

265
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,679
But you're gonna help
us trap him. I'll help you.

266
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:18,657
If you tell me what I am.

267
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,824
I'm not a human. Not a god.

268
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,723
You're the worst parts of both.

269
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,330
Helpless as a human,
immortal as a god.

270
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,891
So, everyone you
ever love will die

271
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:33,433
and you're just stuck here on
this stupid rock, alone, forever.

272
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:34,974
Because no one can kill you

273
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:38,409
except for... Oh, hey,
someone exactly like me.

274
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,143
So, listen. This
is a living stone.

275
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,980
Its blood keeps The
Monster from traveling.

276
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,995
Blackspire's made of thousands of
these. That's why it's the perfect prison.

277
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,386
Unless, of course,
someone opens the door.

278
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,620
But the blood can hold him
in place for a few minutes.

279
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:55,184
So, bleed the stone,
dump the blood on him,

280
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:56,490
I'll take him to the castle.

281
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:00,158
You really need me, or did
you just come here to talk shit?

282
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,836
Gods can't touch the blood.

283
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,930
It fritzes our powers. Not
that that's a problem for you.

284
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:10,904
I'll be watching. Once you
dump the blood, I'll do the rest.

285
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:15,542
And please, don't do your
usual thing and screw it up.

286
00:15:18,985 --> 00:15:21,921
Okay. Cloak's back on.

287
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,551
What?

288
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:30,194
Do I have a booger?

289
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,535
Oh.

290
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,594
That wasn't as
bad as I expected,

291
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:43,471
considering it was
my first cry as a widow.

292
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:46,477
Yeah. Just two short hours.

293
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:50,082
How long did you cry?

294
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,779
When you found out
that Eliot's... That he...

295
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:55,822
I've been a little busy.

296
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:58,587
And it seems like
you're good now.

297
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:00,789
So, I'm gonna go. Wait, Margo.

298
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:02,952
Margo.

299
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:04,154
Margo.

300
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,389
High King Margo.

301
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:09,929
You're returned.
And just leaving.

302
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:14,998
Before you do, could you say
hello to Her Slowness, Abigail?

303
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:19,140
She's not herself. Seeing
you might lift her spirits.

304
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:20,472
What's wrong with her?

305
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,772
She's not speaking.

306
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,484
She hasn't said a
word to me all day.

307
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,415
Rafe.

308
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,580
Come here.

309
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:38,760
So, great, you have each other.
I'm going to find my birthright box.

310
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,362
Look, not to be a dick,

311
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:47,100
but, uh, drawing blood from a
stone is a saying for a reason.

312
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:50,041
Yeah, I know. She wasn't
in the mood to elaborate.

313
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,010
Yeah, she was too
busy making threats.

314
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:55,440
Shoshana has her reservations,
but we have no choice, so...

315
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,949
Wait, what reservations?

316
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,484
Well, Shoshana thinks that...
Iris can't be trusted. Okay?

317
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:02,317
That bitch is all sketch.
Bacchus hated her.

318
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,721
Why, did she give
him an intervention?

319
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,658
No, he wouldn't say,
and he told me everything.

320
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:09,457
Okay, look, the point is,

321
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:12,966
Iris talked him into doing
something a long time ago, okay?

322
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,092
And the fact that he
wouldn't say what it was,

323
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,534
that should be
enough to scare us off.

324
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:21,171
Look, we don't have a choice.
Iris made that damn clear.

325
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,175
So, if you could help
us... I am helping.

326
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:24,904
No, Shoshana, you're
getting in the way.

327
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:28,471
No, she's right.
We have to do this.

328
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:33,853
Q, if this works, Eliot will be
locked in Castle Blackspire forever.

329
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,520
Eliot's dead.

330
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,025
And The Monster's
coming back here,

331
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,357
so let's figure this
out before he does?

332
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:53,963
Hey.

333
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:55,566
Hey.

334
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:58,838
Penny, right?

335
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,044
I know you?

336
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,594
Well, here it is, Charlton.
My greatest trauma.

337
00:18:18,197 --> 00:18:21,065
Someone put a sheet over you and
wheeled around your strange bed.

338
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:24,233
That's Logan Kinnear.

339
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:25,970
Very deceased.

340
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,434
That's me.

341
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,570
The first time I ever
used magic was...

342
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:35,208
To kill Logan with
that school bus.

343
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,008
That is very fuck.

344
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:40,443
That's still not quite right.

345
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:42,852
It's more of an adverb.

346
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:46,088
Anyway, he was a bully.

347
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:48,992
He was the single
worst person in my life.

348
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:52,356
I can't tell you how many times he
made me think about killing myself.

349
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:56,467
But when I did this,

350
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,128
I became the worst
person in my life.

351
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:03,670
Well, this has been
very therapeutic,

352
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,342
but I'm not seeing any doors.

353
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:09,441
Is there something especially
painful that you're avoiding?

354
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:15,287
Look at me. I would say that I am
suffering some very special pain.

355
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,483
Well, it's not all bad.

356
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,886
You have a friend
to comfort you.

357
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,922
My only childhood friend.

358
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:27,431
Taylor.

359
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:31,537
Everyone else would
taunt and bully me,

360
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:35,003
but never Taylor. Never.

361
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:38,575
Oh, shit.

362
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:41,938
I think I know
where we need to go.

363
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:45,815
Bitch. BOY 2: Yeah!

364
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,729
You can kick him
harder than that.

365
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:48,830
What, you wanna kiss boys?

366
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,054
Queer. BOY 6: Kick him.

367
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:51,833
- Faggot.
- Little bitch.

368
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,758
- Let's kick him.
- Come on, kick him.

369
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:56,557
All right, that's enough.

370
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:57,924
He gets the point.

371
00:19:58,064 --> 00:20:00,533
Let's go, come on.
Let's go. Out of here.

372
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:01,862
Let's go. Come on.

373
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:05,870
Hey! Eliot!

374
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:07,763
I said, that's enough.

375
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:10,637
Oh, my...

376
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,572
Come on, Taylor.
Let's go, buddy.

377
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,212
Hating myself for
who I am is one thing,

378
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,708
but to hurt somebody else?

379
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,157
Do you see a door? None.

380
00:20:28,594 --> 00:20:30,495
Back to the Happy Place?

381
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:37,061
Hey!

382
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:38,761
Hey.

383
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:42,726
You got to get a visitor's
pass from the front office.

384
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,390
Oh, my God, it worked.

385
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:08,257
Fantastic news.

386
00:21:08,801 --> 00:21:10,133
Ow! Oh, God.

387
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:13,571
What are you doing?

388
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,804
Uh, reading.

389
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:18,143
Hmm.

390
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,078
Hmm. BOTH: Hmm.

391
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:23,544
You are so boring sometimes.

392
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:27,150
Look what I found.

393
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:32,416
How did you do that?

394
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:34,983
I went to Mesopotamia,
like you told me to.

395
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,254
I never said...

396
00:21:37,329 --> 00:21:38,874
It's really quite different
than I remember,

397
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:40,366
and I couldn't find
anything useful.

398
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:42,867
I got so frustrated
I almost broke it.

399
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:46,599
But when I pick it up
and focus my power into it,

400
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:48,971
this happens.

401
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,401
What does it say?

402
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,570
We could look those
up. The symbols.

403
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,637
Really? How? JULIA: Books.

404
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:55,814
Books.

405
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:58,146
- There's a library here.
- Library.

406
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,884
Or we can take a field trip.

407
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:02,114
Field trip. To...

408
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:05,801
Brakebills. We could take
a field trip to Brakebills.

409
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:08,192
They have a huge library.

410
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,951
Field trip to...

411
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:12,362
Tons of books. Brakebills.

412
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:18,897
Holy dick shit!

413
00:22:19,872 --> 00:22:22,068
What are you
doing? The Last Lay.

414
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:24,240
The widow lays
in her marital bed

415
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,870
buried in the garments
of her deceased love.

416
00:22:27,413 --> 00:22:29,712
I was worried. You weren't
at the bare-breasted laments.

417
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:33,216
Yeah? My boobs can lament
just fine covered, thanks.

418
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:35,233
Can we get the
locksmith up here?

419
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:36,614
Everyone's gone for the day.

420
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,154
The whole staff is gone?

421
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:41,220
Except for the carpenters
building the Altar of Remembrance.

422
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:02,914
Hi, Quentin.

423
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:09,649
I need to tell you
something. Can I come in?

424
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:12,318
Uh, no. Fine.

425
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:16,361
I was in the Library...
Of course you were.

426
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:17,691
Don't be a shit.

427
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,258
They locked me up, okay?

428
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:21,294
But I escaped,

429
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:23,563
and I changed our books
so that they can't track us.

430
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:26,699
And when I was reading
your book, I read the end.

431
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,171
Q, you die in two days.

432
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:32,004
Why should I believe you?

433
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:39,408
You're bleeding a living stone,
right? To kill The Monster?

434
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:43,565
You spend two
whole days bleeding it,

435
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,751
and when you finally douse
him with it, he kills you.

436
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:48,755
Look, I'm not here to scare you.

437
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:51,201
I'm just here to tell you to
forget the plan and run now.

438
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:54,256
If we don't trap The
Monster, Iris kills Julia.

439
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:59,065
So, thank you for the information,
but I'm not bailing on her.

440
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:00,538
It's your life, Q.

441
00:24:00,606 --> 00:24:01,733
What if I beat the book?

442
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:05,169
It says it takes two days.
What if I bleed it faster than that?

443
00:24:06,712 --> 00:24:09,944
Any changes to the book
can have a ripple effect.

444
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:11,808
Maybe it would work.

445
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:16,919
I can't do it any faster,
so if you care to help, um...

446
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:27,724
I hate books.

447
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:30,429
Let's go back to the apartment.

448
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:34,465
Nope, sorry. If we wanna
find it, it's gonna be here.

449
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:37,675
This is it.

450
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:40,504
You found it? Yes.

451
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:41,579
No. No?

452
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,007
Yes?

453
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:47,976
This game is confusing.

454
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:49,854
Which is it? JULIA: Yes.

455
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:54,459
We found something.
It's just the wrong thing.

456
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:56,358
It's just totally wrong.

457
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:58,892
I'm sorry.

458
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:09,804
I really hate books.

459
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:21,319
Okay.

460
00:25:21,387 --> 00:25:23,618
This is the inscription,
but we're trying to stall him.

461
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,180
I thought I was helping.

462
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:28,317
I know. Look, you should
go help Q at the apartment.

463
00:25:28,394 --> 00:25:30,829
Please let me stay.
I'll stall him, I'll shut up,

464
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:32,660
I'll do whatever
you want, just...

465
00:25:33,165 --> 00:25:34,861
He already took Bacchus from me.

466
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:36,993
I couldn't stand losing
another god to him.

467
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:40,065
Okay. Just stay out
of the way, got it?

468
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:41,997
Yes, yes, my goddess. Yes.

469
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:44,489
This is too many.

470
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,671
If I cut it down anymore,
we're chopping bone.

471
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,514
Any one of these
could have the door.

472
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,860
Or a creature
waiting to kill us.

473
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:52,214
It's really best
if we stay here.

474
00:25:53,318 --> 00:25:55,844
No, I have to let my
friends know I'm still in here.

475
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,788
We have to go back.

476
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,382
Whatever you say, Jack Shephard.

477
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:05,557
Was that a <i>Lost</i> reference?

478
00:26:05,631 --> 00:26:07,075
You watched it all one
week over Christmas.

479
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:10,001
I stayed in that memory for a while.
What did you think of the finale?

480
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,162
Stay on task, Charlton.

481
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:14,134
How do we survive visiting
all of these memories?

482
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:16,818
The large man in the short
pants was quite awful, wasn't he?

483
00:26:16,842 --> 00:26:18,842
That's what we need. More
large men in short pants?

484
00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:21,379
Even better.

485
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:24,949
Charlton, meet my friends.

486
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,610
Quentin, from the time I
convinced him to fight Penny.

487
00:26:28,287 --> 00:26:31,519
Fen, who was ready to fight
pirates at a moment's notice.

488
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,525
And Margo, the Welters captain.

489
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,721
No force in heaven or
on Earth is more terrifying.

490
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:38,889
If you pathetic sons of bitches

491
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:42,694
aren't crying blood by
the time this is over...

492
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:43,768
Okay, okay.

493
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:45,997
Save it for the creatures
that you'll be fighting

494
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:49,872
while I look for a door back to
my body located in one of these.

495
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:53,606
Every memory, I've shoved
to a dark corner of my mind.

496
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:56,739
Because being self-aware
and happy don't always mix.

497
00:26:57,416 --> 00:27:00,284
Let's start with the
Embarrassments Minora.

498
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:05,284
The worst haircut of my life.

499
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:15,560
I'm sorry.

500
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:18,329
He's just a little shy.

501
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:23,435
Are you serious right now?

502
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,254
Well, it's not like this has
ever happened before.

503
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:30,215
Failing that, we move
on to the darker stuff.

504
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:31,511
All right, let's do this.

505
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:33,945
Welcome to the
Physical Kids cottage.

506
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:37,718
I sleep with
people's boyfriends.

507
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,540
I've betrayed my
friends by accident.

508
00:27:59,545 --> 00:28:01,013
Go left, go left.

509
00:28:10,989 --> 00:28:12,719
And on purpose.

510
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:17,056
Guards.

511
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:18,994
No, Eliot.

512
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:21,423
Take her to the dungeon. No!

513
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:23,828
Eliot...

514
00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:29,337
God damn it.

515
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,442
There's still no fucking doors.

516
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,308
I was feeling really
good about those.

517
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:34,877
Brace yourselves, everyone.

518
00:28:34,947 --> 00:28:37,246
It's daddy issues and
dicks from here on out.

519
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:40,310
They're here.

520
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,055
Run. Run.

521
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:50,287
You ever tango with a
knife maker's daughter?

522
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:51,495
Come at me!

523
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:53,898
I got this!

524
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,638
Your face looks like a scrotum!

525
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:02,373
Go!

526
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:06,941
You bargain-basement creature!

527
00:29:18,357 --> 00:29:19,357
Get some towels.

528
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:21,211
Is it bad? - Don't look.

529
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:27,857
Fuck. You got it right.

530
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:29,927
Yeah.

531
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:43,145
That should do it.

532
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:48,150
It just needs to drain
and... For a minute or two.

533
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:52,256
You can, uh, leave now.

534
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:56,060
Uh, when Julia gets out
of the Brakebills ward,

535
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:59,030
she'll text me and I'll
meet her in the park.

536
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:01,896
Then we trap The Monster today,
not in two days. So we're good.

537
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:04,462
Deathly fate averted.

538
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:05,902
I should be there with you

539
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,815
just in case what happens
in the book starts happening.

540
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:10,399
I'm about to kill my friend.
It's a monster, I know,

541
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,172
but it's a monster with his
face and eyes and I'm just...

542
00:30:13,245 --> 00:30:16,682
I don't have space
for us right now.

543
00:30:16,748 --> 00:30:18,114
I'm not asking you to!

544
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:25,648
"A dog approached,
wanting to play.

545
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:30,259
"The owner followed to talk
to Quentin, distracting him.

546
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:31,558
"And in that moment,

547
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:34,259
"The Monster saw the
stone's blood and Quentin,

548
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:37,762
"and with a mere
thought, sliced him apart,

549
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:41,337
"so ending the story
of Quentin Coldwater."

550
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:46,708
I didn't come here to make up with
you. I came here to save your life.

551
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:50,506
I'm just trying to figure out how to fix
this mountain of shit that I've created.

552
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:53,842
Well, it's gonna take a
lot more than just my life.

553
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,025
I sent Christopher Plover
to the Poison World.

554
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:06,330
I figure that should give
me some points in my favor.

555
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:07,457
You what?

556
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,494
Well, I was supposed to
send him to a peaceful world,

557
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:12,947
but I thought that maybe he would
do something to a little kid and...

558
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:14,649
And you know what, he
doesn't deserve peace.

559
00:31:14,673 --> 00:31:16,539
Oh, my God.

560
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:20,508
Sorry, I'm back where you
were confessing to murdering

561
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:21,889
my favorite
children's book author.

562
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:26,146
And, yeah, I know, he's evil, but
it's... So, does that make me good?

563
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:29,484
Does killing him make
me better or worse?

564
00:31:31,256 --> 00:31:32,256
I don't know.

565
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:37,753
I am trying.

566
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:41,029
Okay, Quentin? I
am always trying.

567
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:46,765
So, if you have some recipe for
perfect redemption, just tell me.

568
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:50,334
Because I can't change the
way that you feel, so just...

569
00:31:56,548 --> 00:31:57,948
There's a spell...

570
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:01,583
Okay, there's a
spell in here that...

571
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:04,534
That will tell me where
I'm supposed to go.

572
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:07,718
So, just let me come with you
and then do this spell with me.

573
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:09,955
And then wherever
it says to go, I'll go,

574
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:12,623
and I will stay there for good,
okay? Just let me help you.

575
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:17,826
Wherever it says?

576
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:23,568
Do you promise?

577
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:27,542
I promise.

578
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:33,815
Do whatever you gotta
do. Just get it open.

579
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,651
This seems rash, even for you.

580
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:43,224
Well, like my ex always said, "I'll
be happy once that box is open."

581
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:46,155
Margo, have you
cried yet? For Eliot?

582
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:48,756
Fen, I'm only
gonna say this once.

583
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:52,601
Me joining your sad-face
therapy party is dumb.

584
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:57,142
Because I can't cry out
all the sadness, ever.

585
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:03,981
Because if I start, I'll
never stop, understand?

586
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:08,320
I'll be useless forever.

587
00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:11,653
And somebody has
to rule this kingdom,

588
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:14,625
and I will be God
damned if I drop the ball

589
00:33:14,693 --> 00:33:17,356
'cause I was too busy lamenting
with my tits out, all right?

590
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:21,565
Your Majesty.

591
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:23,363
With deep regret,
I must inform you,

592
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:27,098
the royal sheep choir,
they've gone silent, too.

593
00:33:27,439 --> 00:33:28,959
But we need them
for the memorial.

594
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,938
Who else will sing
the <i>Bleats of Despair?</i>

595
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:33,477
High King Margo.

596
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:45,415
A talking lizard of the Dunes.

597
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,425
I've only ever read about these.

598
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:50,894
Well, what's my
birthright, you scaly shit?

599
00:33:57,302 --> 00:33:58,497
It's the talking animals.

600
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:00,871
They've all been struck dumb.

601
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:05,108
Well, shit. All right, Fen.

602
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:09,313
I think I will do a ritual. Earth
specialty. The sleep of solitude.

603
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:11,941
I pop an Ambien, everyone
leaves me alone till noon.

604
00:34:12,017 --> 00:34:13,451
That'll be perfect.

605
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,247
Hmm.

606
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:20,553
I never asked.

607
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:23,558
When you found your door, um,

608
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:27,029
what memory was it?

609
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:31,832
The day that I left home.

610
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:33,864
That's it?

611
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,437
That's your most
traumatic memory? Yes.

612
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:41,375
Because I left... Home.

613
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:45,178
But it was when you were
confronted with what you fear most.

614
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:47,351
Great.

615
00:34:48,153 --> 00:34:53,524
So, just figure out what that
is and I'll make a distraction,

616
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,788
and then you can go there.

617
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:58,119
I know you're just a memory,

618
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:01,023
but you're a very generous one.

619
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:04,834
Well, you sacrifice
for people you love.

620
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:08,137
Oh, shit.

621
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,440
I get it.

622
00:35:12,877 --> 00:35:15,938
Q, I'm gonna take
you up on that.

623
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:24,219
Lead the creatures to
my puberty. Go bravely.

624
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:26,619
Okay.

625
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:34,627
I know where I need to go.

626
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:39,296
Did it happen?

627
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:41,797
Fifty years.

628
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,138
It happened.

629
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:52,413
Okay, so, they should
be coming from there.

630
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:56,717
I'll stand here. He'll come to
me, and then you drench him.

631
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,292
It was sort of beautiful.

632
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,424
It really was.

633
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:07,526
I know this sounds
dumb, but us... We...

634
00:36:09,234 --> 00:36:11,703
You know, think
about it. Like, we work.

635
00:36:14,072 --> 00:36:18,806
And we know it 'cause we've lived it.
Who gets that kind of proof of concept?

636
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:27,312
We were just injected with
a half-century of emotion,

637
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:30,583
so I get that maybe
you're not thinking clearly.

638
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:34,023
No, I'm just saying,
what if we gave it a shot?

639
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:38,561
I mean, would
that be that crazy?

640
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,228
Why the fuck not?

641
00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:51,175
I know you and you aren't...

642
00:36:51,242 --> 00:36:53,473
What's it matter? Don't
be naive. It matters.

643
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:57,478
Q, come on. I love you,

644
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:01,179
but you have to
know that that's not me

645
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:02,777
and that's definitely not you,

646
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:05,289
not when we have a choice.

647
00:37:09,027 --> 00:37:10,222
Okay. I...

648
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:11,793
Okay.

649
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:15,460
Sorry, I...

650
00:37:18,937 --> 00:37:20,929
What the hell is wrong with you?

651
00:37:22,407 --> 00:37:23,705
And what the hell are you doing?

652
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,040
Q, the dog.

653
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:35,653
Hi. Sorry about him.

654
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,364
Train them all you want,
they're still gonna do

655
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:39,348
what they're gonna do, you know?
- Mmm-hmm.

656
00:37:39,524 --> 00:37:40,651
You have a dog?

657
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:42,489
Q, she's the distraction.

658
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,530
No. Right, sorry, I got... Uh...

659
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,121
All right, man.

660
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:50,060
Okay.

661
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:52,780
Q, I'm gonna pour the blood on him,
okay? You just run right now, please.

662
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:54,670
No, look, stick to the plan. Go.

663
00:37:55,073 --> 00:37:56,439
They're coming.

664
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:01,839
Someone good and true loves you.

665
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:03,574
And he went out on a limb.

666
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:07,108
And, yeah, it was a
little crazy, but you knew.

667
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:09,944
You knew this was a
moment that truly mattered

668
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:11,249
and you just snuffed it out.

669
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:24,102
Q, I'm sorry.

670
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,070
I was afraid.

671
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,607
And when I'm afraid, I run away.

672
00:38:54,299 --> 00:38:56,131
If I ever get out of here, Q,

673
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:57,396
know that when I'm braver

674
00:38:57,468 --> 00:39:00,131
it's 'cause I
learned it from you.

675
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:07,638
Quentin.

676
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:31,561
Q.

677
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,333
Q.

678
00:39:39,244 --> 00:39:41,338
It's me. It's Eliot.

679
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:46,178
Okay, no games, come
on. Let's just go. It's Eliot.

680
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:48,076
No, bullshit. Come on.

681
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:50,018
Fifty years.

682
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,358
Who gets proof of
concept like that? What?

683
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:56,661
Peaches and plums, motherfucker.

684
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:58,995
I'm alive in here.

685
00:40:00,031 --> 00:40:01,090
Eliot.

686
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:04,768
No.

687
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,106
Did it work?

688
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:22,285
I hope so.

689
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:28,123
You fucked it up. I warned you.

690
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:30,694
No! Wait, don't!

691
00:40:33,698 --> 00:40:34,698
Look what you did.

692
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:36,633
Iris.

693
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:39,766
Fancy seeing you here.

694
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,575
I'd like it back now.

695
00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:52,981
I'm sorry.

696
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,086
You tried to trick me.

697
00:40:58,156 --> 00:40:59,954
No. No, it wasn't...

698
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:01,988
The plan worked, right, Q?

699
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:04,222
Who is this now?

700
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,161
Right, the plan... We...

701
00:41:06,898 --> 00:41:07,898
We got Iris for you.

702
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:10,595
We couldn't tell you
because she was watching,

703
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:12,693
but we did it.

704
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:17,900
This was all just a plan for me?

705
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,769
Yeah.

706
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,780
Yeah, yeah.

707
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:24,849
And here's the best part.

708
00:41:25,717 --> 00:41:28,881
We didn't wanna show you
till you had the piece from Iris.

709
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:30,319
According to this,

710
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:32,815
uh, all those organs,

711
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:34,751
they're building blocks

712
00:41:35,526 --> 00:41:37,791
trying to piece together a body.

713
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:40,798
Is it yours?

714
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:46,927
Impressive.

715
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,706
Eliot's alive.

716
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,668
What? He's alive.

717
00:42:03,488 --> 00:42:04,979
Any minute now.

718
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,130
I was just about to leave...

719
00:42:20,972 --> 00:42:22,770
Does she know that
I just saved your life?

720
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,708
No. I never
thanked you for that.

721
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:30,479
He made me hesitate, and if
I hadn't, Eliot would be gone.

722
00:42:32,183 --> 00:42:36,621
If The Monster's building a body,
maybe there's a way that we can save him.

723
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:38,554
I can help.

724
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,086
Just let me stay.

725
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:46,088
You saved my life. You
can save my life 50 times.

726
00:42:46,264 --> 00:42:50,167
It's not gonna change
anything between us.

727
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:53,360
I loved you.

728
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:02,239
But you couldn't trust that.

729
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:11,278
It's done.

730
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:25,495
Goodbye, Alice.
