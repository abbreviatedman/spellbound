00:00:06,958 --> 00:00:08,429
Previously on <i>"The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:08,617 --> 00:00:10,547
- Will you play with me?
- No!

3
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:12,479
You do remember me, don't you?

4
00:00:12,487 --> 00:00:14,217
- I... I'm Christopher...
- Plover.

5
00:00:14,547 --> 00:00:15,717
You were looking for your book.

6
00:00:15,727 --> 00:00:18,983
Yours and your friends' books
are in the Revision Room.

7
00:00:18,984 --> 00:00:20,932
But I happen to know
where that is.

8
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:23,602
The end of Quentin's book.
He's going to die.

9
00:00:23,603 --> 00:00:25,573
Isn't that how all books end?

10
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:26,573
His ends next week.

11
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:28,573
Your birthright box,

12
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:30,693
which it has been
my honor to guard,

13
00:00:30,693 --> 00:00:33,633
dictated your absence
from the kingdom

14
00:00:33,643 --> 00:00:34,713
and your return.

15
00:00:34,713 --> 00:00:37,713
We need your help, Shoshana.

16
00:00:37,713 --> 00:00:39,653
I have a new deity to follow.

17
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:43,573
The Poison Room fountain has
a stack of books for a statue.

18
00:00:43,593 --> 00:00:45,533
- So if we find the right fountain...
- We can walk right in.

19
00:00:45,543 --> 00:00:48,543
When you get back
what the gods took from you,

20
00:00:48,563 --> 00:00:51,593
could I maybe have Eliot back?

21
00:00:51,603 --> 00:00:53,713
You were friends with Eliot.

22
00:00:53,723 --> 00:00:55,713
The very best of friends.

23
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:59,683
You should know that
your friend Eliot is dead.

24
00:00:59,703 --> 00:01:02,653
I felt the moment his soul died.

25
00:01:02,673 --> 00:01:04,593
Or he's trapped in there.

26
00:01:04,603 --> 00:01:06,543
Forced to watch everything
the Monster does,

27
00:01:06,563 --> 00:01:10,513
just waiting for us
to find a way to help him.

28
00:01:11,733 --> 00:01:14,653
Hello?

29
00:01:17,513 --> 00:01:18,543
There's one thing

30
00:01:18,563 --> 00:01:21,733
every resident of the Physical Kids cottage
must know.

31
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:23,623
Where the bathroom is.

32
00:01:23,623 --> 00:01:25,713
- How to make...
- How to make.

33
00:01:25,733 --> 00:01:28,593
- Our signature cocktail.
- How to make our signature cocktail.

34
00:01:28,603 --> 00:01:29,593
That's what I was trying to...

35
00:01:29,593 --> 00:01:30,733
That's what I meant to say.

36
00:01:32,653 --> 00:01:33,713
Oh.

37
00:01:33,723 --> 00:01:35,713
Now you can make it on your own.

38
00:01:38,753 --> 00:01:40,723
Should I get that?

39
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:47,523
Rather not.

40
00:01:48,723 --> 00:01:51,523
Ah. There you are.

41
00:01:51,533 --> 00:01:52,683
Here I am.

42
00:01:52,703 --> 00:01:55,533
Sorry, I had to interrupt
an orgy upstairs.

43
00:01:55,543 --> 00:01:56,603
You broke up the orgy?

44
00:01:56,623 --> 00:01:59,533
No, I told them
there was a bigger room

45
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:00,533
two doors down.

46
00:02:00,543 --> 00:02:02,563
Mmm.

47
00:02:02,563 --> 00:02:03,713
Now...

48
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:05,643
I don't say this lightly,

49
00:02:05,653 --> 00:02:08,583
but I think this might be
our best party yet.

50
00:02:08,593 --> 00:02:11,743
And I say this with
the weight of my whole heart.

51
00:02:11,753 --> 00:02:13,613
I concur.

52
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:17,713
- I'll get it.
- Don't.

53
00:02:17,723 --> 00:02:21,533
Whoever is that desperate
to come in can't be fun.

54
00:02:25,623 --> 00:02:27,553
Oh.

55
00:02:27,563 --> 00:02:29,623
What do you like most
about summer?

56
00:02:29,623 --> 00:02:31,633
Hmm...

57
00:02:31,653 --> 00:02:32,773
Nothing.

58
00:02:32,783 --> 00:02:34,713
You don't like summer?

59
00:02:37,683 --> 00:02:39,623
No.

60
00:02:39,623 --> 00:02:41,713
Nothing's what I love
about summer.

61
00:02:41,723 --> 00:02:43,623
No class.

62
00:02:43,623 --> 00:02:46,623
No people, just...

63
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,673
beautiful nothing.

64
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:54,553
No...

65
00:02:54,563 --> 00:02:55,753
Go make me a drink.

66
00:02:55,773 --> 00:02:59,653
Mm-kay.

67
00:03:01,713 --> 00:03:03,623
I'm Eliot, by the way.

68
00:03:03,633 --> 00:03:04,753
Uh-oh.

69
00:03:04,753 --> 00:03:07,683
That's... Eliot's my name, too.

70
00:03:07,693 --> 00:03:09,553
Well, that can't be.

71
00:03:09,563 --> 00:03:10,693
What's your middle name?

72
00:03:10,713 --> 00:03:11,783
Um...

73
00:03:11,783 --> 00:03:12,783
Todd?

74
00:03:14,753 --> 00:03:16,573
Should I get that?

75
00:03:16,593 --> 00:03:17,683
Never answer a cop knock.

76
00:03:17,683 --> 00:03:19,593
Oh.

77
00:03:23,693 --> 00:03:25,633
Beautiful nothing.

78
00:03:25,653 --> 00:03:27,713
Now that's the kind of man
I need.

79
00:03:29,653 --> 00:03:31,713
Don't answer it.
Then we have to talk to them.

80
00:03:31,723 --> 00:03:34,683
Oh, come on.
I just want to see who it is.

81
00:03:37,673 --> 00:03:40,593
No, you can't come in.

82
00:03:40,593 --> 00:03:43,653
Well, I'm sorry, but that
sounds like a you problem.

83
00:03:43,653 --> 00:03:45,593
Margo!

84
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:48,633
Margo!

85
00:03:52,783 --> 00:03:56,593
Eliot!

86
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,693
Inside.

87
00:03:59,713 --> 00:04:01,503
- What?
- Inside, we must go inside...

88
00:04:01,503 --> 00:04:02,503
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, no.
Do we know you?

89
00:04:02,503 --> 00:04:03,683
They're coming.

90
00:04:03,683 --> 00:04:04,593
Let me inside, please.

91
00:04:04,613 --> 00:04:06,503
I won't harm her.

92
00:04:06,503 --> 00:04:07,713
This is only
for your urgent attention.

93
00:04:08,753 --> 00:04:11,653
Yeah, I'm not worried about
you harming her.

94
00:04:17,743 --> 00:04:20,703
But you make a point.
Uh, let's go.

95
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:33,753
Are you done being sad now?

96
00:04:33,763 --> 00:04:35,503
I need your help.

97
00:04:35,513 --> 00:04:36,723
No, I'm not.

98
00:04:36,733 --> 00:04:40,623
Is this about your friend?

99
00:04:40,633 --> 00:04:42,653
Because that's not a problem.

100
00:04:42,673 --> 00:04:44,623
I'm your friend.

101
00:04:44,623 --> 00:04:46,773
He's gone, but I'm here.

102
00:04:46,793 --> 00:04:50,573
Same number of friends.

103
00:04:50,593 --> 00:04:51,753
So.

104
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:58,653
What is this?

105
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,563
How am I supposed to know?

106
00:05:00,573 --> 00:05:03,623
I would like for you
to be helpful, Quentin.

107
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:06,673
It's...

108
00:05:06,683 --> 00:05:08,673
really old?

109
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,723
Like beginning
of civilization old.

110
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:11,793
And where was that?

111
00:05:12,503 --> 00:05:14,763
Mesopotamia was the first...

112
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:16,673
That's very helpful, thank you.

113
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:18,613
I will see you
back at the apartment.

114
00:05:28,023 --> 00:05:32,073
<font color="#00FFFF">Synced & corrected by</font> <font color="#D81D1D">MaxPayne</font>

115
00:05:32,113 --> 00:05:35,733
So... spacious.

116
00:05:35,743 --> 00:05:37,793
Mine wasn't nearly
half this size.

117
00:05:38,503 --> 00:05:41,573
What's with the...

118
00:05:41,593 --> 00:05:44,513
that out there, is it...

119
00:05:44,523 --> 00:05:46,753
Sorry, I'm at a loss for words,
which is new for me.

120
00:05:46,753 --> 00:05:48,683
I'm sure you're quite flummoxed.

121
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:51,613
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit,
sit, sit, sit, sit.

122
00:05:51,623 --> 00:05:52,683
Well, the good news:

123
00:05:52,683 --> 00:05:55,743
A monster possessed you
and is inhabiting your body.

124
00:05:55,753 --> 00:05:57,553
- What?
- He normally tears people

125
00:05:57,563 --> 00:05:59,733
to shreds, so believe me,
this is preferable.

126
00:05:59,743 --> 00:06:02,623
And when he possessed you,
he thrust all of you

127
00:06:02,633 --> 00:06:03,753
to this nook of your mind

128
00:06:03,753 --> 00:06:05,613
that holds
all your remembrances.

129
00:06:05,623 --> 00:06:08,573
Everything here is remembrance.

130
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:09,743
Even your friend here.

131
00:06:09,753 --> 00:06:11,723
Now, do me a favor.

132
00:06:11,733 --> 00:06:14,723
Imagine she's not here.

133
00:06:19,753 --> 00:06:20,793
What the fuck?

134
00:06:21,503 --> 00:06:22,563
Oh, tell me.

135
00:06:22,563 --> 00:06:23,753
I've been trying
to understand it.

136
00:06:23,753 --> 00:06:25,603
I just can't figure it out.

137
00:06:25,613 --> 00:06:27,633
What is "fuck"?

138
00:06:27,643 --> 00:06:28,623
Well...

139
00:06:28,623 --> 00:06:30,683
um, well, it's sort of like a...

140
00:06:30,693 --> 00:06:32,723
a chameleon of a word.

141
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:35,513
Wait, um...

142
00:06:35,523 --> 00:06:36,613
Who are you?

143
00:06:36,623 --> 00:06:38,673
Oh, uh, well,

144
00:06:38,683 --> 00:06:39,763
I'm Charlton.

145
00:06:39,773 --> 00:06:43,753
Now, I have repressed
many memories,

146
00:06:43,753 --> 00:06:47,513
but I would never forget
somebody named Charlton.

147
00:06:47,523 --> 00:06:48,723
- Thank you.
- Not a compliment.

148
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:49,723
I'm not a memory.

149
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:52,643
I once was possessed
by the Monster too.

150
00:06:52,653 --> 00:06:54,733
I was in my memory for...

151
00:06:54,743 --> 00:06:55,703
it's hard to say.

152
00:06:55,723 --> 00:06:57,523
That's it.

153
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:58,683
I'm pretty sure I shot you.

154
00:06:58,683 --> 00:07:00,503
Or your body, at least.

155
00:07:00,513 --> 00:07:01,703
Sorry.

156
00:07:01,723 --> 00:07:03,643
No bother.

157
00:07:03,663 --> 00:07:05,753
It was the Monster's longer
than it was mine.

158
00:07:05,763 --> 00:07:08,763
And I have quite enjoyed
the change of scenery.

159
00:07:08,773 --> 00:07:11,663
This is what I call
your Happy Place.

160
00:07:11,673 --> 00:07:13,773
All your pleasant remembrances
live here.

161
00:07:13,793 --> 00:07:17,503
It's very easy to get content
and lose track of time.

162
00:07:17,513 --> 00:07:17,773
And reality.

163
00:07:17,793 --> 00:07:20,733
So you're here to break me out.

164
00:07:20,743 --> 00:07:23,623
My knight in drab armor.

165
00:07:23,623 --> 00:07:24,623
No, that would be ridiculous.

166
00:07:24,623 --> 00:07:26,703
We stay here.

167
00:07:26,723 --> 00:07:28,623
We don't.
I'm taking my body back.

168
00:07:28,633 --> 00:07:29,743
No, no, no, no, no.

169
00:07:29,753 --> 00:07:32,753
This is the only place
the creatures can't come.

170
00:07:32,763 --> 00:07:35,513
We can't... oh, right.

171
00:07:35,523 --> 00:07:37,693
The scary shrieky things
that live outside.

172
00:07:37,703 --> 00:07:38,723
What are they?

173
00:07:38,733 --> 00:07:41,503
The Monster's other hosts.

174
00:07:41,513 --> 00:07:42,653
Inmates from the Castle.

175
00:07:42,673 --> 00:07:45,683
Horrible, wretched mistakes
of the gods,

176
00:07:45,693 --> 00:07:46,703
all of them.

177
00:07:46,723 --> 00:07:48,773
Yeah, but if... if this
is all my memory,

178
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,683
then they can't really
hurt us, right?

179
00:07:50,683 --> 00:07:52,683
Would you care to ask
the Knight Ora?

180
00:07:52,683 --> 00:07:53,793
She was here before you.

181
00:07:54,503 --> 00:07:55,683
- I would, actually.
- Well, you can't.

182
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,643
Because she's dead.
Dead fuck.

183
00:07:58,653 --> 00:07:59,673
That's not quite right.

184
00:07:59,683 --> 00:08:02,683
And I told her that
when you die here,

185
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:04,683
you're gone forever,
but she just had to try

186
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,733
and find her door, and pray
imagine what befell her?

187
00:08:06,743 --> 00:08:08,673
Devoured by creatures.

188
00:08:08,683 --> 00:08:10,503
Flesh rent from her bones.

189
00:08:10,503 --> 00:08:11,563
Skin torn from her skull.

190
00:08:11,573 --> 00:08:13,633
She died staring at her own face

191
00:08:13,643 --> 00:08:16,683
held before her.

192
00:08:16,693 --> 00:08:19,513
- That is awful.
- Yeah.

193
00:08:19,523 --> 00:08:20,743
What's this about a door?

194
00:08:26,513 --> 00:08:28,503
Could you not, please?

195
00:08:28,503 --> 00:08:29,733
What, no time for cheer?

196
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:32,543
We escaped the Library safe.

197
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,673
You hid your friends.
They're safe, too.

198
00:08:34,693 --> 00:08:36,533
Yeah, well, not Quentin.

199
00:08:36,543 --> 00:08:38,773
And what exactly are you
gonna do about it, hmm?

200
00:08:38,783 --> 00:08:40,643
Besides scowl?

201
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:41,723
Save him.

202
00:08:41,733 --> 00:08:44,773
Warn him, I don't know.
I don't owe you an answer.

203
00:08:44,783 --> 00:08:45,723
You wanna know what I think?

204
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,733
Jesus God, never.

205
00:08:47,743 --> 00:08:50,533
I think we need to cast
another spell on that book

206
00:08:50,543 --> 00:08:51,693
for you.

207
00:08:51,703 --> 00:08:53,523
I know exactly
where I need to go.

208
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,693
Quentin's book showed me
where he is.

209
00:08:54,703 --> 00:08:55,743
And he only has
a couple days left.

210
00:08:55,753 --> 00:08:59,573
Oh, so you trust one book
and not the other?

211
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:02,573
That's funny.

212
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,693
There's only one place
I can try to make things right.

213
00:09:04,703 --> 00:09:05,743
Redemption arc.

214
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:09,503
Word of advice,
'cause I can see you need it.

215
00:09:09,513 --> 00:09:10,653
Apologize for
what you've done, fine.

216
00:09:10,663 --> 00:09:11,713
But never for who you are.

217
00:09:11,723 --> 00:09:13,533
'Cause you'll never
be able to change that.

218
00:09:13,543 --> 00:09:15,503
So why pretend?

219
00:09:19,703 --> 00:09:22,543
We're getting closer, aren't we?

220
00:09:22,553 --> 00:09:25,713
Just a few fountains away.

221
00:09:25,723 --> 00:09:27,783
All I need

222
00:09:28,503 --> 00:09:30,553
is one moment

223
00:09:30,573 --> 00:09:32,723
to find my friends
and tell them I'm alive.

224
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:34,733
Help me.

225
00:09:34,743 --> 00:09:36,753
Or I'm kicking you
out of the Happy Place.

226
00:09:36,763 --> 00:09:38,503
I can do that.

227
00:09:38,513 --> 00:09:40,643
Right?
Yeah.

228
00:09:42,753 --> 00:09:45,503
There's a door somewhere.

229
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:48,503
Hidden deep
in a forgotten remembrance.

230
00:09:48,503 --> 00:09:49,703
Forgotten remembrance?

231
00:09:49,713 --> 00:09:51,693
For me it was the door
to my childhood bedroom.

232
00:09:51,703 --> 00:09:54,523
But not... part of the memory.

233
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:55,703
Just...

234
00:09:55,713 --> 00:09:56,763
just there.
What memory?

235
00:09:56,773 --> 00:10:00,513
Where... how did
you get there, Charlton?

236
00:10:00,523 --> 00:10:02,673
You can get to any memory.

237
00:10:02,693 --> 00:10:04,783
You just think on it
and walk outside.

238
00:10:05,503 --> 00:10:07,513
The one you seek, though,
is difficult to find.

239
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,703
It's hidden well.

240
00:10:08,713 --> 00:10:10,713
Even from you.

241
00:10:10,723 --> 00:10:12,713
It hides in the place
you think of least

242
00:10:12,723 --> 00:10:15,663
because you don't wish to.

243
00:10:15,673 --> 00:10:16,623
Why?

244
00:10:16,633 --> 00:10:18,773
Because it's so terrible.

245
00:10:18,783 --> 00:10:20,753
Huh.
So just my most

246
00:10:20,763 --> 00:10:23,553
repressed and traumatic memory.

247
00:10:23,573 --> 00:10:26,583
This'll be fun.

248
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:28,733
Come on, Charlton.

249
00:10:28,743 --> 00:10:30,583
Time to take a walk
down memory lane.

250
00:10:30,593 --> 00:10:32,543
Wait, wait, wait.

251
00:10:32,553 --> 00:10:33,783
Why do I have to come?
You're coming.

252
00:10:34,503 --> 00:10:36,783
Are you sure this is
the right one?

253
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:38,703
What, you don't trust the book?

254
00:10:38,713 --> 00:10:40,513
Well, no, it's just I...

255
00:10:40,523 --> 00:10:41,753
Well, I've never seen one
locked before.

256
00:10:41,753 --> 00:10:44,583
Here.

257
00:11:11,523 --> 00:11:13,533
I'll throw this down for you
in case you change your mind

258
00:11:13,543 --> 00:11:14,613
and you wanna climb back up.

259
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:17,573
Oh, very good.

260
00:11:20,543 --> 00:11:24,503
Right.

261
00:11:24,503 --> 00:11:27,603
Well, Alice, I suppose
this is good-bye.

262
00:11:27,613 --> 00:11:30,583
I do hope wherever you go is...

263
00:11:30,593 --> 00:11:32,623
is where you're supposed to be.

264
00:11:32,633 --> 00:11:34,533
Same to you.

265
00:11:34,543 --> 00:11:37,763
Right.
Well, here goes...

266
00:12:02,613 --> 00:12:08,743
- Hey, 23! Can I get a ride?
- I ain't your personal Uber.

267
00:12:08,753 --> 00:12:11,123
I'm back to Earth
after finishing the eggs,

268
00:12:11,127 --> 00:12:13,211
which I'm telling myself
come from a chicken.

269
00:12:13,213 --> 00:12:14,283
It'll be real quick.

270
00:12:14,293 --> 00:12:16,373
I just need to get
my birthright box.

271
00:12:16,383 --> 00:12:20,077
And I'd love to do that before having to
break the Eliot news to the whole castle.

272
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:22,328
Because that's not gonna be
a short convo.

273
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:24,654
Yeah, I'm helping Julia
with a god power thing.

274
00:12:24,655 --> 00:12:28,078
You're seriously blowing me off
to score points with your crush?

275
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:29,987
I'm the only one that
can perform the ritual.

276
00:12:29,988 --> 00:12:33,088
You're the one that brought
your fuckboy with you.

277
00:12:33,098 --> 00:12:38,672
I brought Josh 'cause we needed
a decent cook. And we're cool.

278
00:12:38,673 --> 00:12:40,118
Just like Julia and me are cool.

279
00:12:40,128 --> 00:12:43,078
- Cool?
- Cool, so about that ride?

280
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:46,078
Thanks for breakfast.

281
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:48,348
High King Margo, you're back!

282
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:52,168
Where's Eliot?

283
00:12:58,148 --> 00:13:00,198
Hey, Julia, uh...

284
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:02,198
ready to run some diagnostics?

285
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:06,178
Sup, Shoshana?
Oh, we already ran them.

286
00:13:06,188 --> 00:13:09,360
Oh, uh...
Okay, what did they say?

287
00:13:09,361 --> 00:13:10,385
Inconclusive.

288
00:13:10,386 --> 00:13:12,788
Uh, we're looking for
the right ritual to try.

289
00:13:12,789 --> 00:13:17,298
But, um, I'm her follower now,
so I can handle it.

290
00:13:17,308 --> 00:13:20,966
- Right, so I'll just...
- Oh, do you happen to know

291
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:25,348
any diagnostics to run
on pseudo-gods or whatever?

292
00:13:25,358 --> 00:13:27,088
Can't say that I do.

293
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:29,328
Mm.
Oh, so...

294
00:13:29,338 --> 00:13:33,208
We're good here, then.

295
00:13:33,218 --> 00:13:36,308
Right.
I'm gonna bounce.

296
00:13:36,318 --> 00:13:42,218
Uh, text me if you, uh,
need a ride, or... something.

297
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,960
- Thanks, Penny.
- Oh, shit, I...

298
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:49,711
I totally forgot to ask
if you have any magical wards or cloaks.

299
00:13:49,721 --> 00:13:50,801
They could be interfering.

300
00:13:50,811 --> 00:13:53,661
Uh, yeah, a massive cloaking spell.

301
00:13:53,671 --> 00:13:55,731
This evil bitch
Irene McAllister is after me...

302
00:13:55,741 --> 00:13:57,681
So, uh, you can't remove it.
I need it.

303
00:13:57,691 --> 00:14:00,196
Oh, crap, I just did.

304
00:14:00,197 --> 00:14:05,457
Um, just, um, give me 30 seconds.
I'll protect you.

305
00:14:05,467 --> 00:14:07,287
Julia.

306
00:14:07,297 --> 00:14:09,277
Check out this bitch.

307
00:14:09,287 --> 00:14:10,317
Iris.

308
00:14:13,287 --> 00:14:14,457
What are you doing here?

309
00:14:14,467 --> 00:14:16,277
That Monster you let
out of the Castle

310
00:14:16,287 --> 00:14:18,287
is after me and my friends.

311
00:14:18,297 --> 00:14:20,327
Gods in hiding.
It's so gauche.

312
00:14:20,337 --> 00:14:22,196
But you're gonna
help us trap him.

313
00:14:22,197 --> 00:14:23,447
I'll help you.

314
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:25,297
If you tell me what I am.

315
00:14:25,307 --> 00:14:27,217
I'm not a human.

316
00:14:27,227 --> 00:14:28,357
Not a god.

317
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,327
You're the worst parts of both.

318
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:33,477
Helpless as a human,
immortal as a god,

319
00:14:34,197 --> 00:14:38,699
so everyone you ever love will die and
you're just stuck here on this stupid rock,

320
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,630
alone, forever.

321
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:41,620
Because no one can kill you

322
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,670
except for, oh, hey,

323
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,630
someone exactly like me.

324
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:46,710
So listen.

325
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,700
This is a living stone.

326
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,720
Its blood keeps the Monster
from traveling.

327
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:53,700
Blackspire's made of thousands of these.
That's why it's the perfect prison.

328
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:56,620
Unless, of course,
someone opens the door.

329
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,600
But the blood can hold him
in place for a few minutes.

330
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,820
So bleed the stone,
dump the blood on him.

331
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,650
I'll take him to the Castle.

332
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,670
You really need me, or...

333
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,580
did you just come here
to talk shit?

334
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,680
Mm.

335
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,680
Gods can't touch the blood.

336
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:11,680
It fritzes our powers,

337
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,830
not that that's a problem
for you.

338
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,860
I'll be watching.

339
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,770
Once you dump the blood,
I'll do the rest.

340
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:22,670
And please, don't do your
usual thing and screw it up.

341
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:30,860
Okay.
Cloak's back on.

342
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:32,480
What?

343
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,380
Do I have a booger?

344
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,540
Well.

345
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,440
That wasn't as bad
as I expected,

346
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:50,370
considering it was
my first cry as a widow.

347
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:54,520
Yeah.
Just two short hours.

348
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:57,380
How long did you cry?

349
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,500
When you found out
that Eliot's...

350
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,520
that he...

351
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:03,440
I've been a little busy.

352
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:05,480
And it seems like
you're good now.

353
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:06,510
So I'm gonna go.

354
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,490
Wait, wait, Margo.

355
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:09,570
Margo.

356
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:12,570
Margo.

357
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,450
High King Margo.

358
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,590
You're returned.
And just leaving.

359
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,570
Before you do,

360
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:22,440
could you say hello
to Her Slowness, Abigail?

361
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,580
She's not herself.

362
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,560
Seeing you might lift
her spirits.

363
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,590
What's wrong with her?

364
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,370
She's not speaking.

365
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,420
She hasn't said a word
to me all day.

366
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,440
Rafe.

367
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:37,510
Come here.

368
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,410
So, great, you have each other.

369
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,530
I'm going to find
my birthright box.

370
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,650
Look, not to be a dick, but, uh,

371
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:53,540
drawing blood from a stone
is a saying for a reason.

372
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,580
Yeah, I know.

373
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,510
She wasn't in the mood
to elaborate.

374
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,630
Yeah, she was too busy
making threats.

375
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:01,370
Shoshana has her reservations,

376
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:02,390
but we have no choice, so...

377
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,590
Wait, what reservations?

378
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,370
- Well, Shoshana thinks that...
- Iris can't be trusted.

379
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:07,560
Okay?
That bitch is all sketch.

380
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:09,420
Bacchus hated her.

381
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,510
Why, did she, uh, give him
an intervention?

382
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,550
No, he wouldn't say.

383
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,500
And he told me everything.

384
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,590
Okay, look, the point is,

385
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,440
Iris talked him
into doing something

386
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:19,610
a long time ago, okay,

387
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,650
and the fact that he wouldn't
say what it was?

388
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:24,470
That should be enough
to scare us off.

389
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,510
Look, we don't have a choice.

390
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,370
Iris made that damn clear.

391
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:29,610
So if you could help us...
I am helping.

392
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,450
No, Shoshana, you're
getting in the way.

393
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:35,460
No, she's right.
We have to do this.

394
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:38,400
Q, if this works,

395
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:41,530
Eliot will be locked
in Castle Blackspire forever.

396
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,370
Eliot's dead.

397
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:46,470
And the Monster's
coming back here.

398
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,430
So let's figure this out
before he does.

399
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,510
- Hey.
- Hey.

400
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:08,640
- Penny, right?
- I know you?

401
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,430
Well, here it is, Charlton.

402
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,570
My greatest trauma.

403
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,370
Someone put a sheet over you

404
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:28,500
and wheeled around
your strange bed.

405
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:32,390
That's Logan Kinnear.

406
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,570
Very deceased.

407
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,440
That's me.

408
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,510
The first time I ever
used magic was, um...

409
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,600
to kill Logan
with that school bus.

410
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,610
That is very fuck.

411
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,550
That's, um, still
not quite right.

412
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,440
It's more of an adverb.

413
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,610
Anyway, he was a bully.

414
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,570
He was the single worst person
in my life.

415
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,420
I can't tell you how many times

416
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:02,510
he made me think
about killing myself.

417
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,450
But when I did this,

418
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:08,380
I became the worst person
in my life.

419
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,620
Well, this has been...

420
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,470
very therapeutic.

421
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,420
Um, but I'm not seeing
any doors.

422
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,480
Is there something...

423
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,590
especially painful
that you're avoiding?

424
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,460
Look at me.
I would say that I...

425
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:23,400
I... I am suffering
some very special pain.

426
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:25,580
Well, it's not all bad.

427
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,570
You have a friend
to comfort you.

428
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,520
My only childhood friend.

429
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:35,590
Taylor.

430
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,520
Everyone else would
taunt and bully me,

431
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:41,520
but never Taylor.

432
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:44,580
Never.

433
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,620
Oh, shit.

434
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:51,410
I think I know
where we need to go.

435
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,590
- Bitch.
- Yeah!

436
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,410
You can kick him
harder than that.

437
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,520
What, you wanna kiss boys?

438
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,620
- Queer.
- Kick him.

439
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,470
- Faggot.
- Little bitch.

440
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,470
- Let's kick him.
- Come on, kick him.

441
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,500
All right, that's enough.

442
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,590
He gets the point.

443
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,500
Let's go, come on.
Let's go.

444
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,500
Out of here.

445
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,470
Let's go.
Come on.

446
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,570
Hey! Eliot!

447
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,570
I said that's enough.

448
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,500
Oh, my.

449
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:21,610
Come on, Taylor.
Let's go, buddy.

450
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:25,580
Hating myself for who I am
is one thing, but...

451
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:29,540
to hurt somebody else?

452
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:35,630
- Do you see a door?
- None.

453
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,640
Back to the Happy Place?

454
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,550
Hey!

455
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,440
Hey.

456
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,560
You got to get a visitor's pass
from the front office.

457
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,440
Oh, my God, it worked.

458
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:15,600
Fantastic news.

459
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,500
Ow, oh, God.

460
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,590
What are you doing?

461
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,450
Um, reading.

462
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:33,530
You are so boring sometimes.

463
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,590
Look what I found.

464
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,450
How did you do that?

465
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,370
I went to Mesopotamia
like you told me to.

466
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,420
I never said...

467
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,460
It's really quite different
than I remember,

468
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,620
and I couldn't find
anything useful.

469
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:50,580
I got so frustrated
I almost broke it.

470
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,460
But when I pick it up

471
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,500
and focus my power into it,

472
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,580
this happens.

473
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,620
What does it say?

474
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,480
We could look those up.

475
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,430
The symbols.
Really? How?

476
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,380
Books.

477
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,400
Books.

478
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:05,620
- There's a library here.
- Mm, library.

479
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:08,560
Or we can take a field trip.

480
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:12,560
- Field trip...
- To... Brakebills.

481
00:22:12,561 --> 00:22:13,570
We could take a field trip
to Brakebills.

482
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,630
They have... they have
a huge library.

483
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,570
Field trip to...

484
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,610
- Tons of books.
- To Brakebills.

485
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:27,510
Holy dick shit!

486
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,510
What are you doing?

487
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,620
The Last Lay.

488
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:31,630
The widow lays
in her marital bed

489
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,600
buried in the garments
of her deceased love.

490
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:37,540
I was worried; You weren't
at the bare-breasted laments.

491
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:41,460
Yeah? My boobs can lament
just fine covered, thanks.

492
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:44,500
- Can we get the locksmith up here?
- Everyone's gone for the day.

493
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:47,460
- The whole staff is gone?
- Except for the carpenters

494
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,370
building the Altar
of Remembrance.

495
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:12,380
Hi, Quentin.

496
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,610
I need to tell you something.

497
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,470
Can I come in?

498
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,480
- Uh, no.
- Fine.

499
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,580
I was in the Library...

500
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,640
Of course you were.

501
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:26,580
Don't be a shit.

502
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,370
They locked me up, okay?

503
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,460
And... but I escaped,

504
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:32,620
and I changed our books
so that they can't track us.

505
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:35,540
And when I was reading
your book I read the end.

506
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:38,590
Q, you die in two days.

507
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,470
Why should I believe you?

508
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,620
You're bleeding
a living stone, right?

509
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:50,580
To kill the Monster?

510
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,480
You spend two whole days
bleeding it

511
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,500
and when you finally douse him
with it, he kills you.

512
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,520
I'm not here to scare you.

513
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:57,610
I'm just here to tell you

514
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:00,470
to forget the plan and run now.

515
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,620
If we don't trap the Monster,

516
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:04,390
Iris kills Julia.

517
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,530
So thank you
for the information,

518
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,630
but I'm not bailing on her.

519
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,390
It's your life, Q.

520
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,500
What if I beat the book?

521
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:15,390
It says it takes two days.
What if I bleed it faster than that?

522
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,600
Any changes to the book
can have a ripple effect.

523
00:24:18,610 --> 00:24:21,380
Maybe it would work.

524
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:24,370
I can't do it any faster,
so if you...

525
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:26,570
care to help, um...

526
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:37,380
I... hate books.

527
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:39,410
Let's go back to the apartment.

528
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,380
Nope, sorry.

529
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:45,390
If we wanna find it,
it's gonna be here.

530
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,430
This is it.

531
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,550
You found it?

532
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,480
- Yes. No?
- No.

533
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,640
Yes...?

534
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,620
This game is confusing.

535
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,480
- Which is it?
- Yes.

536
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,500
We found something.

537
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:03,500
It's just the, um,
the wrong thing.

538
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,620
It's just totally wrong.

539
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,620
I'm sorry.

540
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:18,590
I really hate books.

541
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,380
Okay.

542
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:32,790
This is the inscription,
but we're trying to stall him.

543
00:25:32,791 --> 00:25:34,133
I thought I was helping.

544
00:25:34,134 --> 00:25:36,920
I know. Look, you should
go help Q at the apartment.

545
00:25:36,923 --> 00:25:39,520
Please let me stay.
I'll stall him, I'll shut up,

546
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:41,600
I'll do whatever you want,
just...

547
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,560
he already took Bacchus from me.

548
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:46,410
I couldn't stand losing
another god to him.

549
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,336
Okay. Just stay out of the way, got it?

550
00:25:49,369 --> 00:25:52,149
Yes, yes, my goddess.
Yes.

551
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,379
This is too many.

552
00:25:53,441 --> 00:25:55,631
If I cut it down any more,
we're chopping bone.

553
00:25:55,641 --> 00:25:57,451
Any one of these
could have the door.

554
00:25:57,461 --> 00:25:58,661
Or creature waiting to kill us.

555
00:25:58,671 --> 00:26:01,601
It's really best
if we stay here.

556
00:26:01,611 --> 00:26:04,681
No, I have to let my friends
know I'm still in here.

557
00:26:04,691 --> 00:26:06,721
We have to go back.

558
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:10,691
Whatever you say, Jack Shepherd.

559
00:26:10,701 --> 00:26:14,189
Was that a... "Lost" reference?

560
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,990
You watched it all
one week over Christmas.

561
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,821
I stayed in that memory
for a while.

562
00:26:17,831 --> 00:26:18,831
What did you think
of the finale?

563
00:26:18,841 --> 00:26:20,298
Stay on task, Charlton.

564
00:26:20,299 --> 00:26:22,449
How do we survive visiting
all of these memories?

565
00:26:22,459 --> 00:26:25,560
Oh, the large man in the short
pants was quite awful, wasn't he?

566
00:26:25,806 --> 00:26:27,947
- That's what we need.
- More large men in short pants?

567
00:26:29,528 --> 00:26:30,438
Even better.

568
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:33,649
Charlton, meet my friends.

569
00:26:33,649 --> 00:26:36,559
Quentin from the time
I convinced him to fight Penny.

570
00:26:36,569 --> 00:26:40,439
Fen, who was ready to fight
pirates at a moment's notice.

571
00:26:40,449 --> 00:26:42,459
And Margo the Welters captain.

572
00:26:42,469 --> 00:26:45,579
No force in heaven or on Earth
is more terrifying.

573
00:26:45,589 --> 00:26:51,870
If you pathetic sons of bitches aren't
crying blood by the time this is over...

574
00:26:51,871 --> 00:26:52,479
Okay, okay.

575
00:26:52,489 --> 00:26:54,399
Save it for the creatures
that you'll be fighting

576
00:26:54,399 --> 00:26:56,619
while I look for a door
back to my body

577
00:26:56,629 --> 00:26:58,599
located in one of these.

578
00:26:58,609 --> 00:27:02,489
Every memory I've shoved
to a dark corner of my mind.

579
00:27:02,499 --> 00:27:05,509
Because being self-aware
and happy don't always mix.

580
00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:10,569
Let's start with
the Embarrassments Minora.

581
00:27:12,479 --> 00:27:16,499
The worst haircut of my life.

582
00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:24,659
I'm sorry.

583
00:27:24,669 --> 00:27:27,609
He's just a little shy.

584
00:27:30,639 --> 00:27:32,649
Are you serious right now?

585
00:27:32,649 --> 00:27:34,659
Well, it's not like
this has ever happened before.

586
00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:38,619
Failing that, we move on
to the darker stuff.

587
00:27:38,629 --> 00:27:40,459
All right, let's do this.

588
00:27:40,469 --> 00:27:42,579
Welcome to the Physical Kids
cottage.

589
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:46,609
I sleep with people's
boyfriends.

590
00:28:03,639 --> 00:28:08,399
I've betrayed my friends
by accident.

591
00:28:08,409 --> 00:28:09,669
Go left, go left.

592
00:28:19,449 --> 00:28:21,619
And on purpose.

593
00:28:24,489 --> 00:28:26,429
Guards.

594
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:27,649
No, Eliot.

595
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:30,679
- Take her to the dungeon.
- No!

596
00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:33,499
Eliot...

597
00:28:36,449 --> 00:28:38,489
Ugh, God damn it.

598
00:28:38,499 --> 00:28:40,459
There's still no fucking doors.

599
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:42,399
I was feeling really good
about those.

600
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:43,599
Brace yourselves, everyone.

601
00:28:43,609 --> 00:28:46,539
Alt's daddy issues and dicks
from here on out.

602
00:28:48,459 --> 00:28:52,409
They're here.

603
00:28:52,419 --> 00:28:57,439
Run. Run.

604
00:28:57,449 --> 00:28:59,419
You even tango with
a knife maker's daughter?

605
00:28:59,429 --> 00:29:00,529
Come at me!

606
00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:02,599
I got this!

607
00:29:02,609 --> 00:29:05,419
[growling

608
00:29:06,459 --> 00:29:09,539
Your face looks like a scrotum!

609
00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:12,419
Agh! Go!

610
00:29:13,549 --> 00:29:16,539
You bargain basement creature!

611
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:26,619
Oh...

612
00:29:26,629 --> 00:29:28,439
Get some towels.

613
00:29:28,449 --> 00:29:32,429
- Is it bad?
- Don't look.

614
00:29:33,549 --> 00:29:35,429
Fuck.

615
00:29:35,439 --> 00:29:38,549
You got it right.
Yeah.

616
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:53,629
That should do it.

617
00:29:53,639 --> 00:29:57,399
It just needs to drain and...

618
00:29:57,399 --> 00:29:59,469
for a minute or two.

619
00:29:59,479 --> 00:30:02,609
You can, uh, leave now.

620
00:30:02,619 --> 00:30:06,211
Uh, when Julia gets out
of the Brakebills ward,

621
00:30:06,212 --> 00:30:08,462
she'll text me
and I'll meet her in the park.

622
00:30:08,472 --> 00:30:11,212
Then we trap the Monster today,
not in two days.

623
00:30:11,212 --> 00:30:12,322
So we're good.

624
00:30:13,348 --> 00:30:14,398
Deathly fate averted.

625
00:30:14,508 --> 00:30:15,538
I should... I should
be there with you

626
00:30:15,548 --> 00:30:17,777
just in case what happens
in the book starts happening.

627
00:30:17,778 --> 00:30:19,037
I'm about to kill my friend.

628
00:30:19,038 --> 00:30:22,190
It's a monster, I know, but it's a
monster with his face and eyes

629
00:30:22,193 --> 00:30:26,711
and I'm just... I don't have
space for us right now.

630
00:30:26,712 --> 00:30:28,622
I'm not asking you to!

631
00:30:32,672 --> 00:30:36,702
"A dog approached,
wanting to play.

632
00:30:36,712 --> 00:30:39,872
"The owner followed to talk
to Quentin, distracting him.

633
00:30:39,882 --> 00:30:40,892
"And in that moment,

634
00:30:40,902 --> 00:30:44,632
"The Monster saw
the stone's blood and Quentin,

635
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:47,728
"and, with a mere thought,
sliced him apart,

636
00:30:47,729 --> 00:30:51,869
so ending the story
of Quentin Coldwater."

637
00:30:53,458 --> 00:30:54,978
I didn't come here
to make up with you.

638
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:56,869
I came here to save your life.

639
00:30:56,879 --> 00:30:58,809
I'm just trying to figure out
how to fix

640
00:30:58,819 --> 00:31:01,759
this mountain of shit
that I've created.

641
00:31:01,769 --> 00:31:05,849
Well, it's gonna take
a lot more than just my life.

642
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:13,979
I sent Christopher Plover
to the Poison World.

643
00:31:13,989 --> 00:31:16,749
I figure that should give me
some points in my favor.

644
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:17,999
You what?

645
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:20,348
Well, I was supposed to
send him to a peaceful world,

646
00:31:20,349 --> 00:31:22,742
but I thought that maybe he would
do something to a little kid and...

647
00:31:22,743 --> 00:31:24,259
And you know what,
he doesn't deserve peace.

648
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:27,260
Oh, my God. Oh.

649
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:29,987
Sorry, I'm back
where you were confessing

650
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:31,968
to murdering my favorite
children's book author

651
00:31:31,978 --> 00:31:36,245
and yeah, I know, he's evil, but it's...
But does that make me good?

652
00:31:36,247 --> 00:31:40,417
Does killing him make me
better or worse?

653
00:31:40,427 --> 00:31:42,417
I don't know.

654
00:31:45,347 --> 00:31:47,397
I am trying.

655
00:31:47,407 --> 00:31:51,527
Okay, Quentin?
I am always trying.

656
00:31:52,247 --> 00:31:55,397
So if you have some recipe
for perfect redemption,

657
00:31:55,407 --> 00:31:57,277
just tell me.

658
00:31:57,287 --> 00:31:58,517
Because I can't change
the way that you feel,

659
00:31:58,527 --> 00:32:00,497
so just...

660
00:32:05,517 --> 00:32:08,487
There's a spell...

661
00:32:08,497 --> 00:32:10,387
Okay, there's a spell in here

662
00:32:10,397 --> 00:32:12,327
that...

663
00:32:12,337 --> 00:32:14,487
that will tell me
where I'm supposed to go.

664
00:32:14,497 --> 00:32:16,247
So just let me come with you

665
00:32:16,247 --> 00:32:17,377
and then do this spell with me.

666
00:32:17,387 --> 00:32:19,427
And then wherever
it says to go, I'll go,

667
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,277
and I will stay there
for good, okay?

668
00:32:21,287 --> 00:32:22,387
Just let me help you.

669
00:32:26,247 --> 00:32:27,427
Wherever it says?

670
00:32:31,527 --> 00:32:35,397
Do you promise?

671
00:32:35,407 --> 00:32:38,387
Promise.

672
00:32:40,327 --> 00:32:41,487
Do whatever you gotta do.

673
00:32:41,497 --> 00:32:43,427
Just get it open.

674
00:32:46,287 --> 00:32:48,377
This seems rash, even for you.

675
00:32:48,387 --> 00:32:51,247
Well, like my ex always said,

676
00:32:51,257 --> 00:32:53,257
I'll be happy once that box
is open.

677
00:32:53,267 --> 00:32:54,417
Margo, have you cried yet?

678
00:32:54,427 --> 00:32:56,437
For Eliot?

679
00:32:56,447 --> 00:32:58,407
Fen, I'm only gonna
say this once.

680
00:32:58,417 --> 00:33:03,347
Me joining your sad-face
therapy party is dumb.

681
00:33:03,357 --> 00:33:09,247
Because I can't cry out
all the sadness ever.

682
00:33:09,257 --> 00:33:11,307
Because if I start,

683
00:33:11,317 --> 00:33:15,397
I'll never stop, understand?

684
00:33:15,407 --> 00:33:19,347
I'll be useless forever.

685
00:33:19,357 --> 00:33:21,327
And somebody has to rule
this kingdom,

686
00:33:21,337 --> 00:33:22,527
and I will be God-damned

687
00:33:23,247 --> 00:33:24,357
if I drop the ball

688
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,377
'cause I was too busy
lamenting with my tits out,

689
00:33:26,387 --> 00:33:29,357
all right?

690
00:33:29,377 --> 00:33:31,307
Your Majesty.

691
00:33:31,317 --> 00:33:33,517
With deep regret
I must inform you,

692
00:33:33,527 --> 00:33:36,477
the royal sheep choir?
They've gone silent too.

693
00:33:36,487 --> 00:33:37,497
But we need them
for the memorial.

694
00:33:37,507 --> 00:33:41,347
Who else will sing
the Bleats of Despair?

695
00:33:41,357 --> 00:33:43,527
High King Margo.

696
00:33:53,357 --> 00:33:55,307
A talking lizard of the Dunes.

697
00:33:55,317 --> 00:33:57,287
I've only ever read about these.

698
00:33:57,297 --> 00:34:02,247
Well, what's my birthright,
you scaly shit?

699
00:34:06,407 --> 00:34:08,457
It's the talking animals.

700
00:34:08,477 --> 00:34:11,317
They've all been struck dumb.

701
00:34:11,337 --> 00:34:13,527
Well, shit.

702
00:34:14,247 --> 00:34:19,560
All right, Fen. I think I will do a ritual.
Earth specialty. The sleep of solitude.

703
00:34:19,561 --> 00:34:21,377
I pop an Ambien, everyone
leaves me alone till noon.

704
00:34:21,397 --> 00:34:24,257
That'll be perfect.

705
00:34:27,437 --> 00:34:30,317
Mm, I never asked.

706
00:34:30,337 --> 00:34:33,357
When you found your door, um...

707
00:34:33,377 --> 00:34:37,257
what memory was it?

708
00:34:40,297 --> 00:34:42,257
The day that I left home.

709
00:34:42,277 --> 00:34:43,437
That's it?

710
00:34:43,457 --> 00:34:46,277
That's your most
traumatic memory?

711
00:34:46,297 --> 00:34:47,337
Yes.

712
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:49,397
Because I left...

713
00:34:49,397 --> 00:34:51,317
Home.

714
00:34:51,337 --> 00:34:53,247
But it was
when you were confronted

715
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,457
with what you fear most.

716
00:34:55,477 --> 00:34:57,417
Great.

717
00:34:57,437 --> 00:35:00,527
So just figure out what that is

718
00:35:01,247 --> 00:35:03,317
and I'll make a distraction,

719
00:35:03,317 --> 00:35:05,417
and then... and then you can
go there.

720
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:08,457
I know you're
just a memory, but...

721
00:35:08,457 --> 00:35:12,297
you're a very generous one.

722
00:35:12,297 --> 00:35:16,397
Well, you sacrifice
for people you love.

723
00:35:16,417 --> 00:35:19,397
Oh, shit.

724
00:35:19,397 --> 00:35:22,317
I get it.

725
00:35:22,337 --> 00:35:27,457
Q, I'm gonna take you
up on that.

726
00:35:29,497 --> 00:35:32,397
Lead the creatures
to my puberty.

727
00:35:32,417 --> 00:35:34,297
Go bravely.

728
00:35:35,297 --> 00:35:37,317
Okay.

729
00:35:42,377 --> 00:35:44,377
I know where I need to go.

730
00:35:48,397 --> 00:35:50,357
Did it happen?

731
00:35:50,377 --> 00:35:54,527
Fifty years.

732
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,507
It happened.

733
00:36:01,257 --> 00:36:02,507
Okay, so they should
be coming from there.

734
00:36:02,507 --> 00:36:04,357
I'll stand here.
He'll come to me.

735
00:36:04,377 --> 00:36:07,337
And then you drench him.

736
00:36:10,357 --> 00:36:11,527
It was sort of beautiful.

737
00:36:12,247 --> 00:36:14,257
It really was.

738
00:36:14,277 --> 00:36:16,527
I know this sounds dumb...

739
00:36:17,247 --> 00:36:19,337
but us.
We...

740
00:36:19,357 --> 00:36:20,277
You know, think about it.

741
00:36:20,297 --> 00:36:24,317
Like, we... we work.

742
00:36:24,337 --> 00:36:26,337
And we know it 'cause
we've lived it.

743
00:36:26,357 --> 00:36:29,357
Who gets that kind
of proof of concept?

744
00:36:33,527 --> 00:36:35,297
We were just injected with

745
00:36:35,297 --> 00:36:37,337
a half-century of emotion,

746
00:36:37,357 --> 00:36:41,247
so I get that maybe
you're not thinking clearly.

747
00:36:41,257 --> 00:36:42,527
No, I'm just saying,
what if we...

748
00:36:42,527 --> 00:36:44,527
gave it a shot?

749
00:36:47,277 --> 00:36:49,527
I mean, would that
be that crazy?

750
00:36:52,357 --> 00:36:56,397
Why the fuck not?
I...

751
00:36:56,417 --> 00:36:59,527
I know you and you...

752
00:37:00,247 --> 00:37:01,417
aren't...

753
00:37:01,437 --> 00:37:04,527
- What's the matter?
- Don't be naive. It matters.

754
00:37:04,527 --> 00:37:06,397
Q, come on.

755
00:37:06,417 --> 00:37:09,437
I love you, but...

756
00:37:09,437 --> 00:37:11,437
you have to know
that that's not me

757
00:37:11,457 --> 00:37:13,317
and that's definitely not you,

758
00:37:13,337 --> 00:37:16,437
not when...
not when we have a choice.

759
00:37:19,337 --> 00:37:20,527
Okay. I...

760
00:37:21,247 --> 00:37:24,337
Okay.

761
00:37:24,357 --> 00:37:26,297
Sorry, I...

762
00:37:29,317 --> 00:37:32,437
What the hell is wrong with you?

763
00:37:32,437 --> 00:37:36,437
And what the hell are you doing?

764
00:37:39,297 --> 00:37:42,397
Q, the dog.

765
00:37:44,417 --> 00:37:46,297
- Hi.
- Sorry about him.

766
00:37:46,356 --> 00:37:48,213
Train 'em all you want,
they're still gonna do

767
00:37:48,214 --> 00:37:50,009
- what they're gonna do, you know?
- Mm-hmm.

768
00:37:50,009 --> 00:37:50,879
You have a dog?

769
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,840
- Q, she's the distraction.
- Hmm? No, I...

770
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:57,630
- right, sorry, I got... uh.
- All right, man.

771
00:37:59,932 --> 00:38:00,764
Okay.

772
00:38:00,765 --> 00:38:01,935
Q, I'm gonna pour
the blood on him, okay?

773
00:38:01,935 --> 00:38:03,745
You just run right now, please.

774
00:38:03,765 --> 00:38:05,685
No, look,
stick to the plan. Go.

775
00:38:05,685 --> 00:38:07,805
They're coming.

776
00:38:09,368 --> 00:38:11,428
Someone good and true

777
00:38:11,448 --> 00:38:12,468
loves you.

778
00:38:12,488 --> 00:38:14,408
And he went out on a limb.

779
00:38:14,428 --> 00:38:16,368
And, yeah,
it was a little crazy,

780
00:38:16,388 --> 00:38:17,508
but you knew.

781
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:20,428
You knew this was a moment
that truly mattered

782
00:38:20,428 --> 00:38:21,568
and you just snuffed it out.

783
00:38:32,588 --> 00:38:34,568
Q, I'm sorry.

784
00:38:39,388 --> 00:38:40,528
I was afraid.

785
00:38:40,548 --> 00:38:44,368
And when I'm afraid, I run away.

786
00:39:04,528 --> 00:39:06,488
If I ever get out of here, Q,

787
00:39:06,508 --> 00:39:07,548
know that when I'm braver

788
00:39:07,568 --> 00:39:10,568
it's 'cause I learned it
from you.

789
00:39:16,568 --> 00:39:18,428
Quentin.

790
00:39:40,528 --> 00:39:45,448
Q.

791
00:39:45,468 --> 00:39:46,608
Q.

792
00:39:49,508 --> 00:39:50,588
It's me.

793
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:53,468
It's Eliot.

794
00:39:53,468 --> 00:39:54,588
Okay, no games, come on.

795
00:39:54,608 --> 00:39:56,568
Let's just go.
It's Eliot.

796
00:39:56,568 --> 00:39:58,548
No, bullshit.
Come on.

797
00:39:58,548 --> 00:40:00,508
Fifty years.

798
00:40:00,528 --> 00:40:03,368
Who gets proof of concept
like that?

799
00:40:03,388 --> 00:40:04,488
What?

800
00:40:04,488 --> 00:40:07,588
Peaches and plums, motherfucker.

801
00:40:07,608 --> 00:40:10,508
I'm alive in here.

802
00:40:10,528 --> 00:40:13,468
Eliot.

803
00:40:13,488 --> 00:40:15,488
Whoa, no!

804
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:31,408
Did it work?

805
00:40:31,408 --> 00:40:33,588
I hope so.

806
00:40:36,548 --> 00:40:39,638
You fucked it up.
I warned you.

807
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:42,548
- No!
- Wait, don't!

808
00:40:44,448 --> 00:40:46,428
Look what you did.

809
00:40:46,448 --> 00:40:48,468
Iris.

810
00:40:48,468 --> 00:40:52,468
Fancy seeing you here.

811
00:40:52,468 --> 00:40:55,408
I'd like it back now.

812
00:41:02,428 --> 00:41:04,408
I'm sorry.

813
00:41:06,638 --> 00:41:08,528
You tried to trick me.

814
00:41:08,548 --> 00:41:10,508
No. No, it wasn't...

815
00:41:10,508 --> 00:41:13,448
The plan worked, right, Q?

816
00:41:13,448 --> 00:41:14,588
Who is this now?

817
00:41:14,588 --> 00:41:16,588
Right the plan, the... we...

818
00:41:16,608 --> 00:41:18,368
We got Iris for you.

819
00:41:18,388 --> 00:41:20,528
We couldn't tell you
because she was watching,

820
00:41:20,548 --> 00:41:22,448
but we...

821
00:41:22,448 --> 00:41:25,468
we did it.

822
00:41:25,488 --> 00:41:29,548
This was all just a plan...
for me?

823
00:41:29,568 --> 00:41:31,468
Yeah.

824
00:41:31,468 --> 00:41:33,588
Yeah, yeah, and, um...

825
00:41:33,588 --> 00:41:35,588
and here's the best part.

826
00:41:35,588 --> 00:41:37,428
We didn't wanna show you

827
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:38,638
till you had the piece
from Iris.

828
00:41:38,638 --> 00:41:40,588
According to this,

829
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:43,568
uh, all those organs?

830
00:41:43,568 --> 00:41:45,588
They're building blocks.

831
00:41:45,608 --> 00:41:48,588
Trying to piece together a body.

832
00:41:48,608 --> 00:41:51,488
Is it yours?

833
00:41:56,448 --> 00:41:59,448
Impressive.

834
00:41:59,468 --> 00:42:02,508
Eliot's alive.

835
00:42:02,508 --> 00:42:03,618
What?

836
00:42:03,638 --> 00:42:07,468
He's alive.

837
00:42:13,588 --> 00:42:16,488
Any minute now.

838
00:42:25,568 --> 00:42:27,588
I was just about to leave, I...

839
00:42:31,468 --> 00:42:33,368
Does she know that
I just saved your life?

840
00:42:33,368 --> 00:42:34,448
No.

841
00:42:34,448 --> 00:42:36,588
I never thanked you for that.

842
00:42:36,608 --> 00:42:38,638
He made me hesitate,
and if I hadn't...

843
00:42:38,638 --> 00:42:42,508
Eliot would be gone.

844
00:42:42,528 --> 00:42:46,368
If the Monster's building a body,
maybe there's a way that we can...

845
00:42:46,368 --> 00:42:47,448
save him.

846
00:42:47,468 --> 00:42:49,508
I can help.

847
00:42:49,528 --> 00:42:53,468
Just let me stay.

848
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:54,428
You saved my life.

849
00:42:54,448 --> 00:42:56,508
You can save my life 50 times.

850
00:42:56,528 --> 00:42:58,568
It's not gonna change...

851
00:42:58,568 --> 00:43:01,468
anything between us.

852
00:43:01,468 --> 00:43:03,638
I loved you.

853
00:43:10,488 --> 00:43:14,448
Maybe you couldn't trust that.

854
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:21,618
It's done.

855
00:43:33,548 --> 00:43:36,368
Good-bye, Alice.
