really hurt us, right?

ask the Knight Ora?

die here, you're gone forever.

00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:00,975
But she just had to try and find her
door, and pray imagine what befell her?

179
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:02,746
Devoured by creatures.

180
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:05,713
Flesh rent from her bones,
skin torn from her skull.

181
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:08,516
She died staring at her
own face held before her.

182
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,092
That is awful. Yeah.

183
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:14,991
What's this about a door?

184
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:16,688
(PLOVER WHISTLING)

Could you not, please?
(STOPS WHISTLING)

186
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:23,867
What, no time for cheer?

187
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,473
We escaped the Library, safe.

188
00:08:26,773 --> 00:08:28,799
You hid your friends.
They're safe, too.

189
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,343
Yeah, well, not Quentin.

190
00:08:30,977 --> 00:08:33,446
And what exactly are you
gonna do about it, hmm?

191
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,879
Besides scowl?

192
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,577
Save him.

193
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:39,175
Warn him, I don't know. I
don't owe you an answer.

194
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:40,715
You wanna know what I think?

195
00:08:40,787 --> 00:08:42,221
Jesus God, never.

196
00:08:42,288 --> 00:08:45,884
I think we need to cast another
spell on that book for you.

197
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,952
I know exactly where I need to go.
Quentin's book showed me where he is.

198
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:50,921
And he only has
a couple days left.

199
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,364
Oh. So, you trust one
book and not the other.

200
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:55,697
That's funny.

201
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,981
There's only one place I
can try to make things right.

change that. So, why pretend?

to find my friends and tell
them I'm alive. Help me.

211
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:31,371
Or I'm kicking you
out of the Happy Place.

212
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:34,101
I can do that. Right? Yeah.

213
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,073
There's a door somewhere.

214
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:42,546
(CLEARS THROAT) Hidden
deep in a forgotten remembrance.

215
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,047
Forgotten remembrance?

216
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:45,997
For me, it was the door
to my childhood bedroom.

217
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,619
But not part of the memory.

218
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,858
Just there. What memory?

219
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,757
How did you get there, Charlton?

220
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,320
You can get to any memory.

221
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:59,228
You just think on
it and walk outside.

222
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:02,263
The one you seek, though, is
difficult to find. It's hidden well.

223
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,236
Even from you.

224
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:09,475
It hides in the place you think of
least because you don't wish to.

225
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:12,635
Why? Because it's so terrible.

226
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:16,948
Huh. So, just my most
repressed and traumatic memory.

227
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,309
This'll be fun.

228
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,320
Come on, Charlton.

00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,557
Time to take a walk
down memory lane.

Wait, wait, wait. Why do I
have to come? You're coming.

231
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:30,793
Are you sure this
is the right one?

232
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:32,999
What, you don't trust the book?

233
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:36,059
Well, no, it's just, I've never
seen one locked before.

234

which I'm telling myself
come from a chicken.

251

It'll be real quick. I just
need to get my birthright box.

Eliot news to the whole castle.

gonna be a short convo.

Yeah, I'm helping Julia
with a god power thing.

You're seriously blowing me off
to score points with your crush?

I'm the only one that
can perform the ritual.

your fuckboy with you.

a decent cook. And we're cool.

say? Inconclusive.

the right ritual to try.

now, so I can handle it.

Right, so I'll just... Do
you happen to know

any diagnostics to run on

Oh, shit. I totally forgot to ask if you
have any magical wards or cloaks.

What are you doing here?

291
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:11,641
That Monster you let out of the
castle is after me and my friends.

293
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,679
But you're gonna help
us trap him. I'll help you.

294
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:18,657
If you tell me what I am.

295
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,824
I'm not a human. Not a god.

296
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,723
You're the worst parts of both.

297
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,330

immortal as a god.

So, everyone you
ever love will die

and you're just stuck here on
this stupid rock, alone, forever.

300

except for... Oh, hey,
someone exactly like me.

00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,143
So, listen. This
is a living stone.

303
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:43,980
Its blood keeps The
Monster from traveling.

304
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,995
Blackspire's made of thousands of
these. That's why it's the perfect prison.

305
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,386
Unless, of course,
someone opens the door.

306
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,620
But the blood can hold him
in place for a few minutes.

307
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:55,184
So, bleed the stone,
dump the blood on him,

308
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:56,490
I'll take him to the castle.

309
00:14:57,029 --> 00:15:00,158
You really need me, or did
you just come here to talk shit?

310

Gods can't touch the blood.

311
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:06,930
It fritzes our powers. Not
that that's a problem for you.

312
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:10,904
I'll be watching. Once you
dump the blood, I'll do the rest.

313
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:15,542
And please, don't do your
usual thing and screw it up.

314

Oh. (CHUCKLES)

319
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,594
That wasn't as
bad as I expected,

320
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:43,471
considering it was
my first cry as a widow.

321
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:46,477
Yeah. Just two short hours.

322
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:50,082
How long did you cry?

323
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:53,779
When you found out
that Eliot's... That he...

324
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:55,822
I've been a little busy.

325
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:58,587
And it seems like
you're good now.

326
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:00,789
So, I'm gonna go. Wait, Margo.

327
00:16:01,928 --> 00:16:02,952
Margo.

328
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:04,154
Margo.

329
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,389
High King Margo.

330
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:09,929
You're returned.
And just leaving.

331
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:14,998
Before you do, could you say
hello to Her Slowness, Abigail?

332
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:19,140
She's not herself. Seeing
you might lift her spirits.

333
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:20,472
What's wrong with her?

334
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,772
She's not speaking.

335
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,484
She hasn't said a
word to me all day.

336
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:27,415
Rafe.

337
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,580
Come here.

338
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:38,760
So, great, you have each other.
I'm going to find my birthright box.

339
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:44,362
QUENTIN: Look, not to be a dick,

340
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:47,100
but, uh, drawing blood from a
stone is a saying for a reason.

341
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:50,041
Yeah, I know. She wasn't
in the mood to elaborate.

342
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:52,010
Yeah, she was too
busy making threats.

343
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:55,440
Shoshana has her reservations,
but we have no choice, so...

344
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:56,949
Wait, what reservations?

345
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:59,484
Well, Shoshana thinks that...
Iris can't be trusted. Okay?

346
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:02,317
That bitch is all sketch.
Bacchus hated her.

347
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:04,721
Why, did she give
him an intervention?

348
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,658
No, he wouldn't say,

something a long time ago, okay?

wouldn't say what it was,

enough to scare us off.
