1
00:00:06,678 --> 00:00:08,563
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:08,573 --> 00:00:10,962
- Will you play with me?
- No!

3
00:00:10,973 --> 00:00:12,486
You do remember me, don't you?

4
00:00:12,496 --> 00:00:14,154
- I... I'm Christopher...
- Plover.

5
00:00:14,165 --> 00:00:15,924
You were looking for your book.

6
00:00:15,934 --> 00:00:18,884
Yours and your friends' books
are in the Revision Room.

7
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:20,712
But I happen to know where that is.

8
00:00:20,722 --> 00:00:23,584
The end of Quentin's book.
He's going to die.

9
00:00:23,594 --> 00:00:25,499
Isn't that how all books end?

10
00:00:25,509 --> 00:00:26,848
His ends next week.

11
00:00:26,858 --> 00:00:28,502
Your birthright box,

12
00:00:28,512 --> 00:00:30,939
which it has been my honor to guard,

13
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:33,725
dictated your absence from the kingdom

14
00:00:33,735 --> 00:00:34,987
and your return.

15
00:00:34,997 --> 00:00:37,946
We need your help, Shoshana.

16
00:00:37,956 --> 00:00:39,774
I have a new deity to follow.

17
00:00:39,784 --> 00:00:41,385
The Poison Room fountain

18
00:00:41,395 --> 00:00:43,282
has a stack of books for a statue.

19
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,805
- So if we find the right fountain...
- We can walk right in.

20
00:00:45,816 --> 00:00:48,392
When you get back what
the gods took from you,

21
00:00:48,402 --> 00:00:51,525
could I maybe have Eliot back?

22
00:00:51,535 --> 00:00:54,006
You were friends with Eliot.

23
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:56,051
The very best of friends.

24
00:00:56,061 --> 00:00:59,881
You should know that
your friend Eliot is dead.

25
00:00:59,891 --> 00:01:02,797
I felt the moment his soul died.

26
00:01:02,807 --> 00:01:04,582
Or he's trapped in there.

27
00:01:04,592 --> 00:01:06,410
Forced to watch everything
the Monster does,

28
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,250
just waiting for us
to find a way to help him.

29
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,689
Hello?

30
00:01:17,257 --> 00:01:18,726
There's one thing

31
00:01:18,736 --> 00:01:22,034
every resident of the Physical
Kids cottage must know.

32
00:01:22,044 --> 00:01:24,080
Where the bathroom is.

33
00:01:24,091 --> 00:01:26,125
- How to make...
- How to make.

34
00:01:26,136 --> 00:01:28,638
- Our signature cocktail.
- How to make our signature cocktail.

35
00:01:28,649 --> 00:01:29,868
That's what I was trying to...

36
00:01:29,878 --> 00:01:31,043
that's what I meant to say.

37
00:01:34,012 --> 00:01:36,004
Now you can make it on your own.

38
00:01:39,104 --> 00:01:41,053
Should I get that?

39
00:01:44,414 --> 00:01:47,243
Rather not.

40
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:51,411
Ah. There you are.

41
00:01:51,421 --> 00:01:52,891
Here I am.

42
00:01:52,901 --> 00:01:55,372
Sorry, I had to interrupt
an orgy upstairs.

43
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:56,982
You broke up the orgy?

44
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,332
No, I told them there was a bigger room

45
00:01:59,342 --> 00:02:00,377
two doors down.

46
00:02:02,432 --> 00:02:04,032
Now...

47
00:02:04,042 --> 00:02:05,730
I don't say this lightly,

48
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,515
but I think this might be
our best party yet.

49
00:02:08,525 --> 00:02:12,084
And I say this with
the weight of my whole heart.

50
00:02:12,094 --> 00:02:13,694
I concur.

51
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:17,959
- I'll get it.
- Don't.

52
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:21,277
Whoever is that desperate
to come in can't be fun.

53
00:02:27,457 --> 00:02:29,623
What do you like most about summer?

54
00:02:31,722 --> 00:02:33,148
Nothing.

55
00:02:33,158 --> 00:02:34,899
You don't like summer?

56
00:02:37,815 --> 00:02:39,633
No.

57
00:02:39,643 --> 00:02:41,983
Nothing's what I love about summer.

58
00:02:41,993 --> 00:02:43,637
No class.

59
00:02:43,647 --> 00:02:46,684
No people, just...

60
00:02:46,694 --> 00:02:48,947
beautiful nothing.

61
00:02:50,915 --> 00:02:54,387
No...

62
00:02:54,397 --> 00:02:56,128
Go make me a drink.

63
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,657
I'm Eliot, by the way.

64
00:03:05,147 --> 00:03:07,879
That's... Eliot's my name, too.

65
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:09,402
Well, that can't be.

66
00:03:09,412 --> 00:03:10,925
What's your middle name?

67
00:03:12,212 --> 00:03:15,147
Todd?

68
00:03:15,157 --> 00:03:16,496
Should I get that?

69
00:03:16,506 --> 00:03:17,845
Never answer a cop knock.

70
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:25,679
Beautiful nothing.

71
00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:27,986
Now that's the kind of man I need.

72
00:03:29,737 --> 00:03:31,990
Don't answer it.
Then we have to talk to them.

73
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,872
Oh, come on.
I just want to see who it is.

74
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,607
No, you can't come in.

75
00:03:40,617 --> 00:03:43,741
Well, I'm sorry, but that
sounds like a you problem.

76
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:45,525
Margo!

77
00:03:45,535 --> 00:03:48,712
Margo!

78
00:03:53,238 --> 00:03:56,503
Eliot!

79
00:03:58,548 --> 00:03:59,887
Inside.

80
00:03:59,897 --> 00:04:01,585
- What?
- Inside, we must go inside...

81
00:04:01,595 --> 00:04:03,848
- Yeah, yeah, no. Do we know you?
- They're coming.

82
00:04:03,858 --> 00:04:06,241
Let me inside, please. I won't harm her.

83
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:09,070
This is only for your urgent attention.

84
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,769
Yeah, I'm not worried
about you harming her.

85
00:04:18,046 --> 00:04:20,952
But you make a point. Uh, let's go.

86
00:04:31,973 --> 00:04:34,095
Are you done being sad now?

87
00:04:34,105 --> 00:04:35,270
I need your help.

88
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,011
No, I'm not.

89
00:04:37,021 --> 00:04:40,667
Is this about your friend?

90
00:04:40,677 --> 00:04:42,756
Because that's not a problem.

91
00:04:42,766 --> 00:04:44,628
I'm your friend.

92
00:04:44,638 --> 00:04:47,195
He's gone, but I'm here.

93
00:04:47,205 --> 00:04:50,503
Same number of friends.

94
00:04:50,513 --> 00:04:52,210
So.

95
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,772
What is this?

96
00:04:58,782 --> 00:05:00,470
How am I supposed to know?

97
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,647
I would like for you
to be helpful, Quentin.

98
00:05:03,657 --> 00:05:06,911
It's...

99
00:05:06,921 --> 00:05:08,782
really old?

100
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:10,958
Like beginning of civilization old.

101
00:05:10,968 --> 00:05:12,220
And where was that?

102
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:15,136
Mesopotamia was the first...

103
00:05:15,146 --> 00:05:16,790
That's very helpful, thank you.

104
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,628
I will see you back at the apartment.

105
00:05:29,213 --> 00:05:32,052
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

106
00:05:32,544 --> 00:05:36,027
- So... spacious.

107
00:05:36,037 --> 00:05:38,203
Mine wasn't nearly half this size.

108
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,667
What's with the...

109
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:44,339
that out there, is it...

110
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:47,212
Sorry, I'm at a loss for words,
which is new for me.

111
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:48,822
I'm sure you're quite flummoxed.

112
00:05:48,832 --> 00:05:51,608
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit,
sit, sit, sit, sit.

113
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:53,174
Well, the good news:

114
00:05:53,184 --> 00:05:56,221
a monster possessed you
and is inhabiting your body.

115
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,918
- What?
- He normally tears people

116
00:05:57,928 --> 00:06:00,007
to shreds, so believe me,
this is preferable.

117
00:06:00,017 --> 00:06:02,662
And when he possessed you,
he thrust all of you

118
00:06:02,672 --> 00:06:05,622
to this nook of your mind that
holds all your remembrances.

119
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:08,327
Everything here is remembrance.

120
00:06:08,338 --> 00:06:10,017
Even your friend here.

121
00:06:10,027 --> 00:06:11,976
Now, do me a favor.

122
00:06:11,986 --> 00:06:14,945
Imagine she's not here.

123
00:06:20,037 --> 00:06:21,202
What the fuck?

124
00:06:21,212 --> 00:06:22,769
Oh, tell me.

125
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:25,555
I've been trying to understand it.
I just can't figure it out.

126
00:06:25,565 --> 00:06:27,687
What is "fuck"?

127
00:06:27,697 --> 00:06:28,906
Well...

128
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,864
um, well, it's sort of like a...

129
00:06:30,874 --> 00:06:33,040
a chameleon of a word.

130
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,347
Wait, um...

131
00:06:35,357 --> 00:06:36,609
Who are you?

132
00:06:36,619 --> 00:06:38,872
Oh, uh, well,

133
00:06:38,882 --> 00:06:40,178
I'm Charlton.

134
00:06:40,188 --> 00:06:44,051
Now, I have repressed many memories,

135
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:47,315
but I would never forget
somebody named Charlton.

136
00:06:47,325 --> 00:06:48,969
- Thank you.
- Not a compliment.

137
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:50,318
I'm not a memory.

138
00:06:50,328 --> 00:06:52,756
I once was possessed by the Monster too.

139
00:06:52,766 --> 00:06:55,062
I was in my memory for...

140
00:06:55,072 --> 00:06:56,194
it's hard to say.

141
00:06:56,204 --> 00:06:57,369
That's it.

142
00:06:57,379 --> 00:06:58,849
I'm pretty sure I shot you.

143
00:06:58,859 --> 00:07:00,285
Or your body, at least.

144
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:01,939
Sorry.

145
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:03,723
No bother.

146
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:06,117
It was the Monster's longer
than it was mine.

147
00:07:06,127 --> 00:07:09,163
And I have quite enjoyed
the change of scenery.

148
00:07:09,173 --> 00:07:11,775
This is what I call your Happy Place.

149
00:07:11,785 --> 00:07:14,212
All your pleasant remembrances
live here.

150
00:07:14,222 --> 00:07:17,258
It's very easy to get content
and lose track of time.

151
00:07:17,268 --> 00:07:18,433
And reality.

152
00:07:18,443 --> 00:07:21,001
So you're here to break me out.

153
00:07:21,011 --> 00:07:23,613
My knight in drab armor.

154
00:07:23,623 --> 00:07:24,918
No, that would be ridiculous.

155
00:07:24,928 --> 00:07:26,920
We stay here.

156
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,661
We don't. I'm taking my body back.

157
00:07:28,671 --> 00:07:30,445
No, no, no, no, no.

158
00:07:30,455 --> 00:07:33,100
This is the only place
the creatures can't come.

159
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:35,320
We can't... oh, right.

160
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,975
The scary shrieky things
that live outside.

161
00:07:37,985 --> 00:07:39,147
What are they?

162
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:41,282
The Monster's other hosts.

163
00:07:41,292 --> 00:07:43,153
Inmates from the Castle.

164
00:07:43,164 --> 00:07:45,896
Horrible, wretched mistakes of the gods,

165
00:07:45,906 --> 00:07:47,245
all of them.

166
00:07:47,255 --> 00:07:49,247
Yeah, but if... if this
is all my memory,

167
00:07:49,257 --> 00:07:50,814
then they can't really hurt us, right?

168
00:07:50,824 --> 00:07:52,816
Would you care to ask the Knight Ora?

169
00:07:52,826 --> 00:07:54,208
She was here before you.

170
00:07:54,218 --> 00:07:55,819
- I would, actually.
- Well, you can't.

171
00:07:55,829 --> 00:07:58,735
Because she's dead. Dead fuck.

172
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:00,127
That's not quite right.

173
00:08:00,137 --> 00:08:02,826
And I told her that when you die here,

174
00:08:02,836 --> 00:08:04,871
you're gone forever,
but she just had to try

175
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:07,047
and find her door, and pray
imagine what befell her?

176
00:08:07,057 --> 00:08:08,788
Devoured by creatures.

177
00:08:08,798 --> 00:08:10,268
Flesh rent from her bones.

178
00:08:10,278 --> 00:08:11,791
Skin torn from her skull.

179
00:08:11,801 --> 00:08:13,706
She died staring at her own face

180
00:08:13,716 --> 00:08:16,883
held before her.

181
00:08:16,893 --> 00:08:19,320
- That is awful.
- Yeah.

182
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,061
What's this about a door?

183
00:08:26,337 --> 00:08:28,242
Could you not, please?

184
00:08:28,252 --> 00:08:29,983
What, no time for cheer?

185
00:08:29,993 --> 00:08:32,420
We escaped the Library safe.

186
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,814
You hid your friends. They're safe, too.

187
00:08:34,824 --> 00:08:36,381
Yeah, well, not Quentin.

188
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:39,166
And what exactly are you
gonna do about it, hmm?

189
00:08:39,176 --> 00:08:40,733
Besides scowl?

190
00:08:40,743 --> 00:08:42,343
Save him.

191
00:08:42,353 --> 00:08:45,172
Warn him, I don't know.
I don't owe you an answer.

192
00:08:45,182 --> 00:08:46,614
You wanna know what I think?

193
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,001
Jesus God, never.

194
00:08:48,011 --> 00:08:51,918
I think we need to cast another
spell on that book for you.

195
00:08:51,928 --> 00:08:53,354
I know exactly where I need to go.

196
00:08:53,364 --> 00:08:54,878
Quentin's book showed me where he is.

197
00:08:54,888 --> 00:08:56,401
And he only has a couple days left.

198
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:59,491
Oh, so you trust one book
and not the other?

199
00:08:59,501 --> 00:09:02,494
That's funny.

200
00:09:02,504 --> 00:09:04,844
There's only one place
I can try to make things right.

201
00:09:04,854 --> 00:09:06,367
Redemption arc.

202
00:09:06,377 --> 00:09:09,327
Word of advice,
'cause I can see you need it.

203
00:09:09,337 --> 00:09:11,088
Apologize for what you've done, fine.

204
00:09:11,099 --> 00:09:12,243
But never for who you are.

205
00:09:12,253 --> 00:09:15,212
'Cause you'll never be able to
change that. So why pretend?

206
00:09:19,869 --> 00:09:22,427
We're getting closer, aren't we?

207
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:25,952
Just a few fountains away.

208
00:09:25,962 --> 00:09:28,563
All I need

209
00:09:28,573 --> 00:09:30,435
is one moment

210
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,959
to find my friends
and tell them I'm alive.

211
00:09:32,969 --> 00:09:35,092
Help me.

212
00:09:35,102 --> 00:09:37,094
Or I'm kicking you
out of the Happy Place.

213
00:09:37,104 --> 00:09:38,269
I can do that.

214
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,716
- Right?
- Yeah.

215
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:45,363
There's a door somewhere.

216
00:09:45,373 --> 00:09:48,279
Hidden deep in a forgotten remembrance.

217
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:49,889
Forgotten remembrance?

218
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:51,891
For me it was the door
to my childhood bedroom.

219
00:09:51,901 --> 00:09:54,372
But not... part of the memory.

220
00:09:54,382 --> 00:09:56,026
Just...

221
00:09:56,036 --> 00:09:57,592
- just there.
- What memory?

222
00:09:57,602 --> 00:10:00,334
Where... how did
you get there, Charlton?

223
00:10:00,344 --> 00:10:02,859
You can get to any memory.

224
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:05,209
You just think on it and walk outside.

225
00:10:05,219 --> 00:10:07,298
The one you seek, though,
is difficult to find.

226
00:10:07,308 --> 00:10:08,908
It's hidden well.

227
00:10:08,918 --> 00:10:10,910
Even from you.

228
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,912
It hides in the place you think of least

229
00:10:12,922 --> 00:10:15,785
because you don't wish to.

230
00:10:15,795 --> 00:10:16,873
Why?

231
00:10:16,883 --> 00:10:19,179
Because it's so terrible.

232
00:10:19,189 --> 00:10:21,094
Huh. So just my most

233
00:10:21,104 --> 00:10:23,444
repressed and traumatic memory.

234
00:10:23,454 --> 00:10:26,534
This'll be fun.

235
00:10:26,544 --> 00:10:29,059
Come on, Charlton.

236
00:10:29,069 --> 00:10:30,538
Time to take a walk down memory lane.

237
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:32,453
Wait, wait, wait.

238
00:10:32,463 --> 00:10:34,238
- Why do I have to come?
- You're coming.

239
00:10:34,248 --> 00:10:37,284
Are you sure this is the right one?

240
00:10:37,294 --> 00:10:38,895
What, you don't trust the book?

241
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:40,287
Well, no, it's just I...

242
00:10:40,297 --> 00:10:42,072
well, I've never seen one locked before.

243
00:10:42,082 --> 00:10:44,475
Here.

244
00:11:11,327 --> 00:11:13,652
I'll throw this down for you
in case you change your mind

245
00:11:13,663 --> 00:11:16,526
- and you wanna climb back up.
- Oh, very good.

246
00:11:20,642 --> 00:11:21,932
Right.

247
00:11:24,254 --> 00:11:27,595
Well, Alice, I suppose this is good-bye.

248
00:11:27,605 --> 00:11:30,555
I do hope wherever you go is...

249
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,687
is where you're supposed to be.

250
00:11:32,697 --> 00:11:34,385
Same to you.

251
00:11:34,395 --> 00:11:37,351
Right. Well, here goes...

252
00:12:02,584 --> 00:12:04,894
Hey, 23. Can I get a ride?

253
00:12:06,084 --> 00:12:08,685
I ain't your personal Uber.

254
00:12:09,117 --> 00:12:11,283
I'm back to Earth
after finishing the eggs,

255
00:12:11,294 --> 00:12:13,273
which I'm telling myself
come from a chicken.

256
00:12:13,284 --> 00:12:16,158
It'll be real quick. I just
need to get my birthright box.

257
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:18,596
And I'd love to do that before
having to break the Eliot news

258
00:12:18,606 --> 00:12:20,249
to the whole castle.

259
00:12:20,259 --> 00:12:22,251
Because that's not gonna be
a short convo.

260
00:12:22,261 --> 00:12:24,515
Yeah, I'm helping Julia
with a god power thing.

261
00:12:24,525 --> 00:12:26,299
You're seriously blowing me off

262
00:12:26,309 --> 00:12:28,301
to score points with your crush?

263
00:12:28,311 --> 00:12:30,172
I'm the only one that
can perform the ritual.

264
00:12:30,182 --> 00:12:33,393
You're the one that brought
your fuckboy with you.

265
00:12:33,403 --> 00:12:35,134
I brought Josh

266
00:12:35,144 --> 00:12:37,484
'cause we needed a decent cook.

267
00:12:37,494 --> 00:12:38,659
And we're cool.

268
00:12:38,669 --> 00:12:40,487
Just like Julia and me are cool.

269
00:12:40,497 --> 00:12:43,316
- Cool?
- Cool, so about that ride?

270
00:12:43,326 --> 00:12:46,319
Thanks for breakfast.

271
00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:49,201
High King Margo, you're back!

272
00:12:50,638 --> 00:12:52,640
Where's Eliot?

273
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:00,681
Hey, Julia...

274
00:13:00,691 --> 00:13:02,727
ready to run some diagnostics?

275
00:13:02,737 --> 00:13:06,600
- Sup, Shoshana?
- Oh, we already ran them.

276
00:13:08,177 --> 00:13:09,422
Okay, what did they say?

277
00:13:09,433 --> 00:13:10,517
Inconclusive.

278
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,650
Uh, we're looking for
the right ritual to try.

279
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,739
But, um, I'm her follower now,

280
00:13:14,749 --> 00:13:18,046
so I can handle it.

281
00:13:18,056 --> 00:13:21,180
- Right, so I'll just...
- Oh, do you happen to know

282
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,790
any diagnostics to run

283
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,228
on pseudo-gods or whatever?

284
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:27,403
Can't say that I do.

285
00:13:27,413 --> 00:13:30,189
So...

286
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:33,758
We're good here, then.

287
00:13:33,768 --> 00:13:35,194
Right.

288
00:13:35,204 --> 00:13:37,065
I'm gonna bounce.

289
00:13:37,075 --> 00:13:39,198
Uh, text me if you, uh,

290
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:41,679
need a ride, or...

291
00:13:41,689 --> 00:13:42,810
something.

292
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,770
- Thanks, Penny.
- Oh, shit, I...

293
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,556
I totally forgot to ask if you
have any magical wards or cloaks.

294
00:13:49,566 --> 00:13:50,862
They could be interfering.

295
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:53,429
Uh, yeah, a massive cloaking spell.

296
00:13:53,439 --> 00:13:55,693
This evil bitch
Irene McAllister is after me...

297
00:13:55,703 --> 00:13:57,608
so, uh, you can't remove it. I need it.

298
00:13:57,618 --> 00:14:00,306
Oh, crap, I just did.

299
00:14:00,316 --> 00:14:02,569
Um, just, um, give me 30 seconds.

300
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:06,181
I'll protect you.

301
00:14:06,191 --> 00:14:07,618
Julia.

302
00:14:07,628 --> 00:14:09,576
Check out this bitch.

303
00:14:09,586 --> 00:14:10,674
Iris.

304
00:14:13,582 --> 00:14:15,076
What are you doing here?

305
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:18,672
That Monster you let out of the
Castle is after me and my friends.

306
00:14:18,682 --> 00:14:20,805
Gods in hiding. It's so gauche.

307
00:14:20,815 --> 00:14:22,284
But you're gonna help us trap him.

308
00:14:22,294 --> 00:14:24,156
I'll help you.

309
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:25,636
If you tell me what I am.

310
00:14:25,646 --> 00:14:27,420
I'm not a human.

311
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,856
Not a god.

312
00:14:28,866 --> 00:14:30,728
You're the worst parts of both.

313
00:14:30,738 --> 00:14:34,253
Helpless as a human, immortal as a god,

314
00:14:34,263 --> 00:14:36,168
so everyone you ever love will die

315
00:14:36,178 --> 00:14:38,692
and you're just stuck here
on this stupid rock,

316
00:14:38,702 --> 00:14:40,520
alone, forever.

317
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:41,739
Because no one can kill you

318
00:14:41,749 --> 00:14:43,610
except for, oh, hey,

319
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,525
someone exactly like me.

320
00:14:45,535 --> 00:14:46,744
So listen.

321
00:14:46,754 --> 00:14:48,702
This is a living stone.

322
00:14:48,712 --> 00:14:50,835
Its blood keeps the Monster
from traveling.

323
00:14:50,845 --> 00:14:52,412
Blackspire's made of thousands of these.

324
00:14:52,423 --> 00:14:53,820
That's why it's the perfect prison.

325
00:14:53,831 --> 00:14:56,536
Unless, of course,
someone opens the door.

326
00:14:56,546 --> 00:14:59,408
But the blood can hold him
in place for a few minutes.

327
00:14:59,418 --> 00:15:02,150
So bleed the stone,
dump the blood on him.

328
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,630
I'll take him to the Castle.

329
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,589
You really need me, or...

330
00:15:05,599 --> 00:15:07,329
did you just come here to talk shit?

331
00:15:08,645 --> 00:15:10,637
Gods can't touch the blood.

332
00:15:10,647 --> 00:15:11,899
It fritzes our powers,

333
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:14,162
not that that's a problem for you.

334
00:15:14,172 --> 00:15:15,555
I'll be watching.

335
00:15:15,565 --> 00:15:17,949
Once you dump the blood,
I'll do the rest.

336
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:20,386
And please, don't do your usual thing

337
00:15:20,396 --> 00:15:22,616
and screw it up.

338
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:31,266
Okay. Cloak's back on.

339
00:15:31,276 --> 00:15:32,626
What?

340
00:15:35,672 --> 00:15:37,326
Do I have a booger?

341
00:15:41,896 --> 00:15:43,888
Well.

342
00:15:43,898 --> 00:15:46,542
That wasn't as bad as I expected,

343
00:15:46,552 --> 00:15:50,372
considering it was
my first cry as a widow.

344
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:54,812
Yeah. Just two short hours.

345
00:15:54,822 --> 00:15:57,379
How long did you cry?

346
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,773
When you found out that Eliot's...

347
00:15:59,783 --> 00:16:00,818
that he...

348
00:16:00,828 --> 00:16:03,559
I've been a little busy.

349
00:16:03,569 --> 00:16:05,692
And it seems like you're good now.

350
00:16:05,702 --> 00:16:06,780
So I'm gonna go.

351
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,739
Wait, wait, Margo.

352
00:16:08,749 --> 00:16:09,957
Margo.

353
00:16:09,967 --> 00:16:12,960
Margo.

354
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,570
High King Margo.

355
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,008
- You're returned.
- And just leaving.

356
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:18,966
Before you do,

357
00:16:18,976 --> 00:16:22,535
could you say hello
to Her Slowness, Abigail?

358
00:16:22,545 --> 00:16:23,971
She's not herself.

359
00:16:23,981 --> 00:16:25,930
Seeing you might lift her spirits.

360
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:28,019
What's wrong with her?

361
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:30,325
She's not speaking.

362
00:16:30,335 --> 00:16:32,588
She hasn't said a word to me all day.

363
00:16:32,598 --> 00:16:34,547
Rafe.

364
00:16:34,557 --> 00:16:37,811
Come here.

365
00:16:42,391 --> 00:16:43,774
So, great, you have each other.

366
00:16:43,784 --> 00:16:45,786
I'm going to find my birthright box.

367
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:51,519
Look, not to be a dick, but, uh,

368
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:54,217
drawing blood from a stone
is a saying for a reason.

369
00:16:54,228 --> 00:16:56,787
Yeah, I know. She wasn't
in the mood to elaborate.

370
00:16:56,797 --> 00:16:59,267
Yeah, she was too busy making threats.

371
00:16:59,277 --> 00:17:02,444
Shoshana has her reservations,
but we have no choice, so...

372
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:04,011
Wait, what reservations?

373
00:17:04,021 --> 00:17:06,318
- Well, Shoshana thinks that...
- Iris can't be trusted.

374
00:17:06,328 --> 00:17:07,972
Okay? That bitch is all sketch.

375
00:17:07,982 --> 00:17:09,538
Bacchus hated her.

376
00:17:09,548 --> 00:17:11,802
Why, did she, uh, give
him an intervention?

377
00:17:11,812 --> 00:17:12,890
No, he wouldn't say.

378
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,761
And he told me everything.

379
00:17:14,771 --> 00:17:16,371
Okay, look, the point is,

380
00:17:16,381 --> 00:17:18,634
Iris talked him into doing something

381
00:17:18,644 --> 00:17:20,071
a long time ago, okay,

382
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:22,290
and the fact that he wouldn't
say what it was?

383
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,684
That should be enough to scare us off.

384
00:17:24,694 --> 00:17:26,773
Look, we don't have a choice.

385
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,296
Iris made that damn clear.

386
00:17:28,306 --> 00:17:30,081
- So if you could help us...
- I am helping.

387
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:32,605
No, Shoshana, you're getting in the way.

388
00:17:32,615 --> 00:17:35,618
No, she's right. We have to do this.

389
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,437
Q, if this works,

390
00:17:38,447 --> 00:17:41,832
Eliot will be locked
in Castle Blackspire forever.

391
00:17:41,842 --> 00:17:44,312
Eliot's dead.

392
00:17:44,322 --> 00:17:46,706
And the Monster's coming back here.

393
00:17:46,716 --> 00:17:49,545
So let's figure this out before he does.

394
00:17:59,685 --> 00:18:01,089
Hey.

395
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,710
Hey.

396
00:18:04,473 --> 00:18:06,047
Penny, right?

397
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,304
I know you?

398
00:18:22,304 --> 00:18:24,035
Well, here it is, Charlton.

399
00:18:24,046 --> 00:18:26,125
My greatest trauma.

400
00:18:26,135 --> 00:18:29,259
Someone put a sheet over you and
wheeled around your strange bed.

401
00:18:29,269 --> 00:18:32,567
That's Logan Kinnear.

402
00:18:32,577 --> 00:18:34,351
Very deceased.

403
00:18:35,143 --> 00:18:36,613
That's me.

404
00:18:37,335 --> 00:18:40,164
The first time I ever
used magic was, um...

405
00:18:40,933 --> 00:18:44,230
to kill Logan with that school bus.

406
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,276
That is very fuck.

407
00:18:46,286 --> 00:18:48,104
That's, um, still not quite right.

408
00:18:48,114 --> 00:18:51,716
It's more of an adverb.

409
00:18:51,726 --> 00:18:54,078
Anyway, he was a bully.

410
00:18:54,089 --> 00:18:57,156
He was the single worst person
in my life.

411
00:18:57,166 --> 00:19:01,006
I can't tell you how many times he
made me think about killing myself.

412
00:19:02,998 --> 00:19:04,729
But when I did this,

413
00:19:04,739 --> 00:19:07,131
I became the worst person in my life.

414
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:10,163
Well, this has been...

415
00:19:10,385 --> 00:19:11,823
very therapeutic.

416
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,651
Um, but I'm not seeing any doors.

417
00:19:13,661 --> 00:19:15,261
Is there something...

418
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:19,222
especially painful that you're avoiding?

419
00:19:19,232 --> 00:19:20,789
Look at me. I would say that I...

420
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,618
I... I am suffering
some very special pain.

421
00:19:23,628 --> 00:19:26,185
Well, it's not all bad.

422
00:19:26,195 --> 00:19:29,111
You have a friend to comfort you.

423
00:19:30,678 --> 00:19:33,932
My only childhood friend.

424
00:19:33,942 --> 00:19:36,195
Taylor.

425
00:19:36,205 --> 00:19:39,024
Everyone else would taunt and bully me,

426
00:19:39,034 --> 00:19:41,984
but never Taylor.

427
00:19:41,994 --> 00:19:45,204
Never.

428
00:19:45,214 --> 00:19:47,293
Oh, shit.

429
00:19:47,303 --> 00:19:51,569
I think I know where we need to go.

430
00:19:52,831 --> 00:19:54,213
- Bitch.
- Yeah!

431
00:19:54,223 --> 00:19:55,650
You can kick him harder than that.

432
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,955
What, you wanna kiss boys?

433
00:19:56,965 --> 00:19:58,348
- Queer.
- Kick him.

434
00:19:58,358 --> 00:19:59,828
- Faggot.
- Little bitch.

435
00:19:59,838 --> 00:20:01,830
- Let's kick him.
- Come on, kick him.

436
00:20:03,015 --> 00:20:04,876
All right, that's enough.

437
00:20:04,886 --> 00:20:06,182
He gets the point.

438
00:20:06,192 --> 00:20:07,879
Let's go, come on. Let's go.

439
00:20:07,889 --> 00:20:10,762
Out of here. Let's go. Come on.

440
00:20:12,154 --> 00:20:14,146
Hey! Eliot!

441
00:20:14,156 --> 00:20:16,071
I said that's enough.

442
00:20:17,638 --> 00:20:18,890
Oh, my.

443
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,285
Come on, Taylor. Let's go, buddy.

444
00:20:22,295 --> 00:20:26,202
Hating myself for who I am
is one thing, but...

445
00:20:26,212 --> 00:20:30,162
to hurt somebody else?

446
00:20:34,176 --> 00:20:35,385
Do you see a door?

447
00:20:35,395 --> 00:20:36,429
None.

448
00:20:36,439 --> 00:20:38,354
Back to the Happy Place?

449
00:20:44,012 --> 00:20:46,091
Hey!

450
00:20:46,101 --> 00:20:48,746
Hey.

451
00:20:48,756 --> 00:20:51,096
You got to get a visitor's pass
from the front office.

452
00:21:10,735 --> 00:21:13,651
Oh, my God, it worked.

453
00:21:15,217 --> 00:21:17,862
- Fantastic news.
- Ow, oh, God.

454
00:21:20,309 --> 00:21:23,215
What are you doing?

455
00:21:23,225 --> 00:21:25,053
Um, reading.

456
00:21:28,796 --> 00:21:34,009
You are so boring sometimes.

457
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:35,368
Look what I found.

458
00:21:38,893 --> 00:21:40,755
How did you do that?

459
00:21:40,765 --> 00:21:43,453
I went to Mesopotamia
like you told me to.

460
00:21:43,463 --> 00:21:44,976
I never said...

461
00:21:44,986 --> 00:21:46,761
It's really quite different
than I remember,

462
00:21:46,771 --> 00:21:48,327
and I couldn't find anything useful.

463
00:21:48,337 --> 00:21:51,156
I got so frustrated I almost broke it.

464
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:52,767
But when I pick it up

465
00:21:52,777 --> 00:21:54,899
and focus my power into it,

466
00:21:54,909 --> 00:21:57,162
this happens.

467
00:21:57,172 --> 00:21:58,337
What does it say?

468
00:21:58,347 --> 00:21:59,861
We could look those up.

469
00:21:59,871 --> 00:22:01,732
- The symbols.
- Really? How?

470
00:22:01,742 --> 00:22:02,777
Books.

471
00:22:02,787 --> 00:22:04,126
Books.

472
00:22:04,136 --> 00:22:06,345
- There's a library here.
- Mm, library.

473
00:22:06,355 --> 00:22:09,087
Or we can take a field trip.

474
00:22:09,097 --> 00:22:11,176
- Field trip...
- To...

475
00:22:11,186 --> 00:22:13,926
Brakebills. We could take a
field trip to Brakebills.

476
00:22:13,937 --> 00:22:16,399
They have... they have a huge library.

477
00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:18,096
Field trip to...

478
00:22:18,106 --> 00:22:21,196
- Tons of books.
- To Brakebills.

479
00:22:25,461 --> 00:22:27,932
Holy dick shit!

480
00:22:27,942 --> 00:22:29,020
What are you doing?

481
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,326
The Last Lay.

482
00:22:30,336 --> 00:22:32,415
The widow lays in her marital bed

483
00:22:32,425 --> 00:22:35,287
buried in the garments
of her deceased love.

484
00:22:35,297 --> 00:22:38,029
I was worried; you weren't
at the bare-breasted laments.

485
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:41,816
Yeah? My boobs can lament
just fine covered, thanks.

486
00:22:41,826 --> 00:22:43,426
Can we get the locksmith up here?

487
00:22:43,436 --> 00:22:44,906
Everyone's gone for the day.

488
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:46,298
The whole staff is gone?

489
00:22:46,308 --> 00:22:47,822
Except for the carpenters

490
00:22:47,832 --> 00:22:49,485
building the Altar of Remembrance.

491
00:23:09,897 --> 00:23:11,330
Hi, Quentin.

492
00:23:16,447 --> 00:23:19,005
I need to tell you something.
Can I come in?

493
00:23:19,015 --> 00:23:22,052
- No.
- Fine.

494
00:23:22,863 --> 00:23:24,158
I was in the Library...

495
00:23:24,168 --> 00:23:25,377
Of course you were.

496
00:23:25,387 --> 00:23:27,118
Don't be a shit.

497
00:23:27,128 --> 00:23:28,424
They locked me up, okay?

498
00:23:28,434 --> 00:23:30,077
And... but I escaped,

499
00:23:30,087 --> 00:23:33,341
and I changed our books
so that they can't track us.

500
00:23:33,351 --> 00:23:35,996
And when I was reading
your book I read the end.

501
00:23:36,006 --> 00:23:39,173
Q, you die in two days.

502
00:23:39,183 --> 00:23:42,752
Why should I believe you?

503
00:23:45,146 --> 00:23:47,268
You're bleeding a living stone, right?

504
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:51,185
To kill the Monster?

505
00:23:51,195 --> 00:23:52,839
You spend two whole days bleeding it

506
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:55,886
and when you finally douse him
with it, he kills you.

507
00:23:55,896 --> 00:23:57,278
I'm not here to scare you.

508
00:23:57,288 --> 00:23:58,845
I'm just here to tell you

509
00:23:58,855 --> 00:24:00,850
to forget the plan and run now.

510
00:24:00,861 --> 00:24:04,547
If we don't trap the
Monster, Iris kills Julia.

511
00:24:04,557 --> 00:24:07,027
So thank you for the information,

512
00:24:07,037 --> 00:24:08,333
but I'm not bailing on her.

513
00:24:08,343 --> 00:24:09,552
It's your life, Q.

514
00:24:09,562 --> 00:24:10,901
What if I beat the book?

515
00:24:10,911 --> 00:24:12,250
It says it takes two days.

516
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:15,558
What if I bleed it faster than that?

517
00:24:15,568 --> 00:24:19,213
Any changes to the book
can have a ripple effect.

518
00:24:19,223 --> 00:24:21,520
Maybe it would work.

519
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:24,480
I can't do it any faster, so if you...

520
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:27,057
care to help, um...

521
00:24:34,151 --> 00:24:37,493
I... hate books.

522
00:24:37,503 --> 00:24:39,582
Let's go back to the apartment.

523
00:24:39,592 --> 00:24:41,584
Nope, sorry.

524
00:24:41,594 --> 00:24:45,544
If we wanna find it, it's gonna be here.

525
00:24:45,554 --> 00:24:47,633
This is it.

526
00:24:47,643 --> 00:24:49,026
You found it?

527
00:24:49,036 --> 00:24:50,897
- Yes. No?
- No.

528
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:53,344
Yes...?

529
00:24:55,346 --> 00:24:57,295
This game is confusing.

530
00:24:57,305 --> 00:24:59,036
- Which is it?
- Yes.

531
00:24:59,046 --> 00:25:00,864
We found something.

532
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,910
It's just the, um, the wrong thing.

533
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,347
It's just totally wrong.

534
00:25:06,357 --> 00:25:08,229
I'm sorry.

535
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:19,109
I really hate books.

536
00:25:29,386 --> 00:25:30,418
Okay.

537
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:32,939
This is the inscription,
but we're trying to stall him.

538
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:34,375
I thought I was helping.

539
00:25:34,385 --> 00:25:37,335
I know. Look, you should go
help Q at the apartment.

540
00:25:37,345 --> 00:25:40,033
Please let me stay. I'll
stall him, I'll shut up,

541
00:25:40,043 --> 00:25:42,209
I'll do whatever you want, just...

542
00:25:42,219 --> 00:25:44,037
he already took Bacchus from me.

543
00:25:44,047 --> 00:25:46,605
I couldn't stand losing
another god to him.

544
00:25:46,615 --> 00:25:47,954
Okay.

545
00:25:47,964 --> 00:25:49,347
Just stay out of the way, got it?

546
00:25:49,357 --> 00:25:51,654
Yes, yes, my goddess. Yes.

547
00:25:51,664 --> 00:25:53,394
This is too many.

548
00:25:53,404 --> 00:25:56,049
If I cut it down any more,
we're chopping bone.

549
00:25:56,059 --> 00:25:57,529
Any one of these could have the door.

550
00:25:57,539 --> 00:25:59,183
Or creature waiting to kill us.

551
00:25:59,193 --> 00:26:01,968
It's really best if we stay here.

552
00:26:01,978 --> 00:26:05,232
No, I have to let my friends
know I'm still in here.

553
00:26:05,242 --> 00:26:07,408
We have to go back.

554
00:26:07,418 --> 00:26:11,282
Whatever you say, Jack Shepherd.

555
00:26:11,292 --> 00:26:14,328
Was that a... "Lost" reference?

556
00:26:14,338 --> 00:26:16,156
You watched it all
one week over Christmas.

557
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:17,680
I stayed in that memory for a while.

558
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:20,421
- What did you think of the finale?
- Stay on task, Charlton.

559
00:26:20,431 --> 00:26:23,033
How do we survive visiting
all of these memories?

560
00:26:23,043 --> 00:26:25,684
Oh, the large man in the short
pants was quite awful, wasn't he?

561
00:26:25,695 --> 00:26:29,430
- That's what we need.
- More large men in short pants?

562
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,432
Even better.

563
00:26:31,442 --> 00:26:33,566
Charlton, meet my friends.

564
00:26:34,273 --> 00:26:36,960
Quentin from the time
I convinced him to fight Penny.

565
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,049
Fen, who was ready to fight pirates

566
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:40,616
at a moment's notice.

567
00:26:40,626 --> 00:26:42,705
And Margo the Welters captain.

568
00:26:42,715 --> 00:26:46,012
No force in heaven or on Earth
is more terrifying.

569
00:26:46,022 --> 00:26:48,232
If you pathetic sons of bitches

570
00:26:48,242 --> 00:26:51,409
aren't crying blood
by the time this is over...

571
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:53,106
Okay, okay.

572
00:26:53,116 --> 00:26:55,282
Save it for the creatures
that you'll be fighting

573
00:26:55,292 --> 00:26:57,371
while I look for a door back to my body

574
00:26:57,381 --> 00:26:59,112
located in one of these.

575
00:26:59,122 --> 00:27:02,768
Every memory I've shoved
to a dark corner of my mind.

576
00:27:02,778 --> 00:27:06,076
Because being self-aware
and happy don't always mix.

577
00:27:06,086 --> 00:27:10,960
Let's start with
the Embarrassments Minora.

578
00:27:12,745 --> 00:27:16,782
The worst haircut of my life.

579
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,312
I'm sorry.

580
00:27:25,322 --> 00:27:28,064
He's just a little shy.

581
00:27:31,198 --> 00:27:33,277
Are you serious right now?

582
00:27:33,287 --> 00:27:35,453
Well, it's not like
this has ever happened before.

583
00:27:35,463 --> 00:27:39,152
Failing that, we move on
to the darker stuff.

584
00:27:39,162 --> 00:27:40,676
All right, let's do this.

585
00:27:40,686 --> 00:27:42,992
Welcome to the Physical Kids cottage.

586
00:27:45,168 --> 00:27:47,083
I sleep with people's boyfriends.

587
00:28:04,187 --> 00:28:08,486
I've betrayed my friends by accident.

588
00:28:08,496 --> 00:28:10,324
Go left, go left.

589
00:28:19,637 --> 00:28:22,118
And on purpose.

590
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,547
Guards.

591
00:28:26,557 --> 00:28:28,288
No, Eliot.

592
00:28:28,298 --> 00:28:31,378
- Take her to the dungeon.
- No!

593
00:28:31,388 --> 00:28:33,739
Eliot...

594
00:28:36,611 --> 00:28:38,777
Ugh, God damn it.

595
00:28:38,787 --> 00:28:40,692
There's still no fucking doors.

596
00:28:40,702 --> 00:28:42,476
I was feeling really good about those.

597
00:28:42,486 --> 00:28:44,087
Brace yourselves, everyone.

598
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:46,872
AIt's daddy issues and dicks
from here on out.

599
00:28:48,666 --> 00:28:52,530
They're here.

600
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,718
Run. Run.

601
00:28:57,719 --> 00:28:59,537
You even tango with a
knife maker's daughter?

602
00:28:59,547 --> 00:29:00,756
Come at me!

603
00:29:01,854 --> 00:29:03,149
I got this!

604
00:29:03,159 --> 00:29:05,543
[growling

605
00:29:06,684 --> 00:29:09,895
Your face looks like a scrotum!

606
00:29:09,905 --> 00:29:12,550
Agh! Go!

607
00:29:13,909 --> 00:29:16,825
You bargain basement creature!

608
00:29:27,444 --> 00:29:28,609
Get some towels.

609
00:29:28,619 --> 00:29:31,820
- Is it bad?
- Don't look.

610
00:29:33,886 --> 00:29:35,573
Fuck.

611
00:29:35,583 --> 00:29:37,793
You got it right.

612
00:29:37,804 --> 00:29:38,848
Yeah.

613
00:29:51,918 --> 00:29:54,302
That should do it.

614
00:29:54,314 --> 00:29:57,568
It just needs to drain and...

615
00:29:57,578 --> 00:29:59,875
for a minute or two.

616
00:29:59,885 --> 00:30:03,270
You can, uh, leave now.

617
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,490
Uh, when Julia gets out
of the Brakebills ward,

618
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,406
she'll text me
and I'll meet her in the park.

619
00:30:09,416 --> 00:30:11,539
Then we trap the Monster today,
not in two days.

620
00:30:11,549 --> 00:30:13,018
So we're good.

621
00:30:13,028 --> 00:30:14,454
Deathly fate averted.

622
00:30:14,465 --> 00:30:16,022
I should... I should be there with you

623
00:30:16,033 --> 00:30:18,067
just in case what happens
in the book starts happening.

624
00:30:18,077 --> 00:30:19,338
I'm about to kill my friend.

625
00:30:19,349 --> 00:30:22,506
It's a monster, I know, but it's
a monster with his face and eyes

626
00:30:22,516 --> 00:30:24,639
and I'm just... I don't

627
00:30:24,649 --> 00:30:26,709
have space for us right now.

628
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,566
I'm not asking you to!

629
00:30:32,786 --> 00:30:35,759
"A dog approached, wanting to play.

630
00:30:36,878 --> 00:30:40,437
"The owner followed to talk
to Quentin, distracting him.

631
00:30:40,447 --> 00:30:41,786
"And in that moment,

632
00:30:41,796 --> 00:30:44,615
"The Monster saw
the stone's blood and Quentin,

633
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:49,011
"and, with a mere thought,
sliced him apart,

634
00:30:49,021 --> 00:30:53,494
so ending the story
of Quentin Coldwater."

635
00:30:53,504 --> 00:30:55,322
I didn't come here to make up with you.

636
00:30:55,332 --> 00:30:57,019
I came here to save your life.

637
00:30:57,029 --> 00:30:58,847
I'm just trying to figure out how to fix

638
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,763
this mountain of shit that I've created.

639
00:31:01,773 --> 00:31:05,994
Well, it's gonna take
a lot more than just my life.

640
00:31:10,825 --> 00:31:14,428
I sent Christopher Plover
to the Poison World.

641
00:31:14,438 --> 00:31:16,604
I figure that should give me
some points in my favor.

642
00:31:16,614 --> 00:31:18,432
You what?

643
00:31:18,442 --> 00:31:20,543
Well, I was supposed to send
him to a peaceful world,

644
00:31:20,554 --> 00:31:23,001
but I thought that maybe he would
do something to a little kid and...

645
00:31:23,011 --> 00:31:24,742
and you know what,
he doesn't deserve peace.

646
00:31:24,752 --> 00:31:27,745
Oh, my God. Oh.

647
00:31:27,755 --> 00:31:30,183
Sorry, I'm back
where you were confessing

648
00:31:30,193 --> 00:31:32,141
to murdering my favorite
children's book author

649
00:31:32,151 --> 00:31:33,925
and yeah, I know, he's evil,

650
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:36,537
- but it's...
- But does that make me good?

651
00:31:36,547 --> 00:31:41,150
Does killing him make me
better or worse?

652
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,118
I don't know.

653
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,070
I am trying.

654
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,509
Okay, Quentin? I am always trying.

655
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:56,078
So if you have some recipe
for perfect redemption,

656
00:31:56,088 --> 00:31:57,688
just tell me.

657
00:31:57,698 --> 00:31:59,473
Because I can't change
the way that you feel,

658
00:31:59,483 --> 00:32:01,354
so just...

659
00:32:06,446 --> 00:32:09,396
There's a spell...

660
00:32:09,406 --> 00:32:12,023
Okay, there's a spell in here that...

661
00:32:12,887 --> 00:32:15,146
that will tell me
where I'm supposed to go.

662
00:32:15,157 --> 00:32:17,895
So just let me come with you
and then do this spell with me.

663
00:32:17,906 --> 00:32:20,028
And then wherever
it says to go, I'll go,

664
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:22,984
and I will stay there for good, okay?
Just let me help you.

665
00:32:26,553 --> 00:32:28,120
Wherever it says?

666
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:36,074
Do you promise?

667
00:32:36,084 --> 00:32:39,087
Promise.

668
00:32:40,915 --> 00:32:42,472
Do whatever you gotta do.

669
00:32:42,482 --> 00:32:44,136
Just get it open.

670
00:32:46,747 --> 00:32:49,000
This seems rash, even for you.

671
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,568
Well, like my ex always said,

672
00:32:51,578 --> 00:32:53,614
I'll be happy once that box is open.

673
00:32:53,624 --> 00:32:55,137
Margo, have you cried yet?

674
00:32:55,147 --> 00:32:57,182
For Eliot?

675
00:32:57,192 --> 00:32:59,097
Fen, I'm only gonna say this once.

676
00:32:59,107 --> 00:33:03,928
Me joining your sad-face
therapy party is dumb.

677
00:33:03,938 --> 00:33:09,630
Because I can't cry out
all the sadness ever.

678
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,806
Because if I start,

679
00:33:11,816 --> 00:33:16,071
I'll never stop, understand?

680
00:33:16,081 --> 00:33:19,944
I'll be useless forever.

681
00:33:19,954 --> 00:33:21,859
And somebody has to rule this kingdom,

682
00:33:21,869 --> 00:33:23,513
and I will be God-damned

683
00:33:23,523 --> 00:33:24,949
if I drop the ball

684
00:33:24,959 --> 00:33:26,995
'cause I was too busy
lamenting with my tits out,

685
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,954
all right?

686
00:33:29,964 --> 00:33:31,782
Your Majesty.

687
00:33:31,792 --> 00:33:34,481
With deep regret I must inform you,

688
00:33:34,491 --> 00:33:37,527
the royal sheep choir?
They've gone silent too.

689
00:33:37,537 --> 00:33:38,963
But we need them for the memorial.

690
00:33:38,973 --> 00:33:41,966
Who else will sing
the Bleats of Despair?

691
00:33:41,976 --> 00:33:44,457
High King Margo.

692
00:33:53,988 --> 00:33:55,806
A talking lizard of the Dunes.

693
00:33:55,816 --> 00:33:57,808
I've only ever read about these.

694
00:33:57,818 --> 00:34:02,475
Well, what's my birthright,
you scaly shit?

695
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:09,298
It's the talking animals.

696
00:34:09,308 --> 00:34:11,822
They've all been struck dumb.

697
00:34:11,832 --> 00:34:14,521
Well, shit.

698
00:34:14,531 --> 00:34:16,000
All right, Fen.

699
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:18,046
I think I will do a ritual.
Earth specialty.

700
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,787
The sleep of solitude.

701
00:34:19,797 --> 00:34:22,050
I pop an Ambien, everyone
leaves me alone till noon.

702
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,541
That'll be perfect.

703
00:34:28,196 --> 00:34:31,146
Mm, I never asked.

704
00:34:31,156 --> 00:34:33,931
When you found your door, um...

705
00:34:33,941 --> 00:34:37,510
what memory was it?

706
00:34:40,687 --> 00:34:42,592
The day that I left home.

707
00:34:42,602 --> 00:34:44,246
That's it?

708
00:34:44,256 --> 00:34:46,683
That's your most traumatic memory?

709
00:34:46,693 --> 00:34:47,858
Yes.

710
00:34:47,868 --> 00:34:50,078
Because I left...

711
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,819
Home.

712
00:34:51,829 --> 00:34:53,560
But it was when you were confronted

713
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:56,301
with what you fear most.

714
00:34:56,311 --> 00:34:58,173
Great.

715
00:34:58,183 --> 00:35:01,568
So just figure out what that is

716
00:35:01,578 --> 00:35:03,787
and I'll make a distraction,

717
00:35:03,797 --> 00:35:06,137
and then... and then you can go there.

718
00:35:06,147 --> 00:35:09,271
I know you're just a memory, but...

719
00:35:09,281 --> 00:35:12,709
you're a very generous one.

720
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:17,148
Well, you sacrifice for people you love.

721
00:35:17,158 --> 00:35:20,064
Oh, shit.

722
00:35:20,074 --> 00:35:21,966
I get it.

723
00:35:22,823 --> 00:35:26,907
Q, I'm gonna take you up on that.

724
00:35:30,433 --> 00:35:33,121
Lead the creatures to my puberty.

725
00:35:33,138 --> 00:35:34,705
Go bravely.

726
00:35:35,775 --> 00:35:37,864
Okay.

727
00:35:42,967 --> 00:35:44,925
I know where I need to go.

728
00:35:48,774 --> 00:35:50,722
Did it happen?

729
00:35:50,732 --> 00:35:52,733
Fifty years.

730
00:35:55,258 --> 00:35:57,130
It happened.

731
00:36:01,351 --> 00:36:03,169
Okay, so they should
be coming from there.

732
00:36:03,179 --> 00:36:04,693
I'll stand here. He'll come to me.

733
00:36:04,703 --> 00:36:07,575
And then you drench him.

734
00:36:10,709 --> 00:36:12,265
It was sort of beautiful.

735
00:36:12,275 --> 00:36:14,354
It really was.

736
00:36:14,364 --> 00:36:17,270
I know this sounds dumb...

737
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,621
but us. We...

738
00:36:19,631 --> 00:36:22,550
You know, think about it.
Like, we... we work.

739
00:36:24,592 --> 00:36:26,628
And we know it 'cause we've lived it.

740
00:36:26,638 --> 00:36:29,641
Who gets that kind of proof of concept?

741
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:35,811
We were just injected with

742
00:36:35,821 --> 00:36:37,639
a half-century of emotion,

743
00:36:37,649 --> 00:36:41,338
so I get that maybe
you're not thinking clearly.

744
00:36:41,348 --> 00:36:43,296
No, I'm just saying, what if we...

745
00:36:43,306 --> 00:36:45,178
gave it a shot?

746
00:36:47,397 --> 00:36:50,183
I mean, would that be that crazy?

747
00:36:52,664 --> 00:36:56,832
Why the fuck not? I...

748
00:36:56,842 --> 00:37:00,270
I know you and you...

749
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,967
aren't...

750
00:37:01,977 --> 00:37:05,231
- What's the matter?
- Don't be naive. It matters.

751
00:37:05,241 --> 00:37:06,842
Q, come on.

752
00:37:06,852 --> 00:37:09,932
I love you, but...

753
00:37:09,942 --> 00:37:11,977
you have to know that that's not me

754
00:37:11,987 --> 00:37:13,675
and that's definitely not you,

755
00:37:13,685 --> 00:37:16,949
not when... not when we have a choice.

756
00:37:19,691 --> 00:37:21,247
Okay. I...

757
00:37:21,257 --> 00:37:24,642
Okay.

758
00:37:24,652 --> 00:37:26,436
Sorry, I...

759
00:37:29,526 --> 00:37:32,911
What the hell is wrong with you?

760
00:37:32,921 --> 00:37:36,925
And what the hell are you doing?

761
00:37:39,536 --> 00:37:42,757
Q, the dog.

762
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:46,490
- Hi.
- Sorry about him.

763
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,019
Train 'em all you want,
they're still gonna do

764
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,885
- what they're gonna do, you know?
- Mm-hmm.

765
00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:51,582
You have a dog?

766
00:37:51,592 --> 00:37:54,454
- Q, she's the distraction.
- Hmm? No, I...

767
00:37:54,464 --> 00:37:56,674
right, sorry, I got... uh.

768
00:37:56,685 --> 00:37:57,947
All right, man.

769
00:37:59,513 --> 00:38:00,625
Okay.

770
00:38:00,636 --> 00:38:02,332
Q, I'm gonna pour
the blood on him, okay?

771
00:38:02,342 --> 00:38:03,638
You just run right now, please.

772
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:05,596
No, look, stick to the plan. Go.

773
00:38:05,606 --> 00:38:07,739
They're coming.

774
00:38:09,392 --> 00:38:11,602
Someone good and true

775
00:38:11,612 --> 00:38:12,734
loves you.

776
00:38:12,744 --> 00:38:14,518
And he went out on a limb.

777
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:16,389
And, yeah, it was a little crazy,

778
00:38:16,399 --> 00:38:17,869
but you knew.

779
00:38:17,879 --> 00:38:20,611
You knew this was a moment
that truly mattered

780
00:38:20,621 --> 00:38:22,047
and you just snuffed it out.

781
00:38:33,025 --> 00:38:34,940
Q, I'm sorry.

782
00:38:39,379 --> 00:38:40,892
I was afraid.

783
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:44,297
And when I'm afraid, I run away.

784
00:39:04,839 --> 00:39:06,788
If I ever get out of here, Q,

785
00:39:06,798 --> 00:39:07,963
know that when I'm braver

786
00:39:07,973 --> 00:39:10,932
it's 'cause I learned it from you.

787
00:39:16,982 --> 00:39:18,538
Quentin.

788
00:39:40,875 --> 00:39:45,652
Q.

789
00:39:45,662 --> 00:39:47,132
Q.

790
00:39:49,841 --> 00:39:51,049
It's me.

791
00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:53,704
It's Eliot.

792
00:39:53,714 --> 00:39:55,097
Okay, no games, come on.

793
00:39:55,107 --> 00:39:57,012
- Let's just go.
- It's Eliot.

794
00:39:57,022 --> 00:39:58,927
No, bullshit. Come on.

795
00:39:58,937 --> 00:40:00,842
Fifty years.

796
00:40:00,852 --> 00:40:03,453
Who gets proof of concept like that?

797
00:40:03,463 --> 00:40:04,759
What?

798
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:08,066
Peaches and plums, motherfucker.

799
00:40:08,076 --> 00:40:10,852
I'm alive in here.

800
00:40:10,862 --> 00:40:13,724
Eliot.

801
00:40:13,734 --> 00:40:15,692
Whoa, no!

802
00:40:28,662 --> 00:40:31,481
Did it work?

803
00:40:31,491 --> 00:40:34,059
I hope so.

804
00:40:36,931 --> 00:40:40,229
You fucked it up. I warned you.

805
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:42,894
- No!
- Wait, don't!

806
00:40:44,591 --> 00:40:46,583
Look what you did.

807
00:40:46,593 --> 00:40:48,672
Iris.

808
00:40:48,682 --> 00:40:52,676
Fancy seeing you here.

809
00:40:52,686 --> 00:40:55,505
I'd like it back now.

810
00:41:02,565 --> 00:41:04,437
I'm sorry.

811
00:41:07,266 --> 00:41:08,910
You tried to trick me.

812
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,825
No. No, it wasn't...

813
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:13,610
The plan worked, right, Q?

814
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,046
Who is this now?

815
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:17,135
Right the plan, the... we...

816
00:41:17,145 --> 00:41:18,789
we got Iris for you.

817
00:41:18,799 --> 00:41:20,922
We couldn't tell you
because she was watching,

818
00:41:20,932 --> 00:41:22,619
but we...

819
00:41:22,629 --> 00:41:25,752
we did it.

820
00:41:25,762 --> 00:41:29,974
This was all just a plan... for me?

821
00:41:29,984 --> 00:41:31,671
Yeah.

822
00:41:31,681 --> 00:41:34,109
Yeah, yeah, and, um...

823
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:36,067
and here's the best part.

824
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:37,547
We didn't wanna show you

825
00:41:37,557 --> 00:41:39,244
till you had the piece from Iris.

826
00:41:39,254 --> 00:41:41,116
According to this,

827
00:41:41,126 --> 00:41:43,988
uh, all those organs?

828
00:41:43,998 --> 00:41:46,077
They're building blocks.

829
00:41:46,087 --> 00:41:49,080
Trying to piece together a body.

830
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:51,701
Is it yours?

831
00:41:56,576 --> 00:41:59,656
Impressive.

832
00:41:59,666 --> 00:42:02,833
Eliot's alive.

833
00:42:02,843 --> 00:42:04,182
What?

834
00:42:04,192 --> 00:42:07,674
He's alive.

835
00:42:14,028 --> 00:42:16,726
Any minute now.

836
00:42:25,997 --> 00:42:27,999
I was just about to leave, I...

837
00:42:31,698 --> 00:42:33,342
Does she know that
I just saved your life?

838
00:42:33,352 --> 00:42:34,647
No.

839
00:42:34,657 --> 00:42:37,085
I never thanked you for that.

840
00:42:37,095 --> 00:42:39,217
He made me hesitate, and if I hadn't...

841
00:42:39,227 --> 00:42:42,873
Eliot would be gone.

842
00:42:42,883 --> 00:42:44,179
If the Monster's building a body,

843
00:42:44,189 --> 00:42:46,355
maybe there's a way that we can...

844
00:42:46,365 --> 00:42:47,660
save him.

845
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:49,880
I can help.

846
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:53,710
Just let me stay.

847
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:54,841
You saved my life.

848
00:42:54,851 --> 00:42:56,843
You can save my life 50 times.

849
00:42:56,853 --> 00:42:59,020
It's not gonna change...

850
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:01,674
anything between us.

851
00:43:01,684 --> 00:43:04,165
I loved you.

852
00:43:10,737 --> 00:43:14,567
Maybe you couldn't trust that.

853
00:43:19,224 --> 00:43:22,140
It's done.

854
00:43:33,934 --> 00:43:36,328
Good-bye, Alice.
