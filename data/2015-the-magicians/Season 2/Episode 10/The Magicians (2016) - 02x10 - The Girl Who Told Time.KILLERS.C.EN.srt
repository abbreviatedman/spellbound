1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,514
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:01,634 --> 00:00:04,028
This contract initiates our
services in exchange for...

3
00:00:04,148 --> 00:00:06,150
Unlimited manual
and magical labor?

4
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,136
You signed that insane contract?

5
00:00:08,171 --> 00:00:10,591
- Yeah, it's okay.
- How the hell is that okay?

6
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:11,921
Because I get magic back.

7
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:13,419
Did you do this for me?

8
00:00:13,454 --> 00:00:16,655
I'm Bayler, a proud soldier
of Fillorians United.

9
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,357
We will not rest until

10
00:00:18,392 --> 00:00:20,359
a Fillorian sits
upon the throne.

11
00:00:20,394 --> 00:00:22,428
The fairies can bring back
The Wellspring?

12
00:00:22,463 --> 00:00:24,496
- They can.
- And in return?

13
00:00:24,532 --> 00:00:26,331
A royal child of Whitespire.

14
00:00:26,367 --> 00:00:27,733
We're getting married.

15
00:00:27,768 --> 00:00:30,402
Apparently all monarchs are
entitled to one of each:

16
00:00:30,438 --> 00:00:31,831
<i>a wife and a husband.</i>

17
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:34,239
Alice, I hope you meant it.

18
00:00:34,275 --> 00:00:38,110
I hope you just go
and do beautiful magic.

19
00:00:38,145 --> 00:00:39,545
<i>Quentin says go free.</i>

20
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,214
<i>You fed him to Reynard.</i>

21
00:00:42,249 --> 00:00:43,415
<i>He knew how to survive.</i>

22
00:00:43,451 --> 00:00:45,584
<i>Yeah, by doing what you want.</i>

23
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:48,353
<i>That's all you see anymore,
is what you want.</i>

24
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:50,622
You don't feel
anymore, Julia--

25
00:00:50,658 --> 00:00:52,391
not the way a human does.

26
00:00:52,426 --> 00:00:53,592
Do you remember the gift

27
00:00:53,627 --> 00:00:55,194
that Jane was given in the book

28
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:56,762
"The Girl Who Told Time"?

29
00:00:56,797 --> 00:00:58,897
<i>Ember gave her the ability
to fuck with time</i>

30
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,432
<i>on a cosmic scale.</i>

31
00:01:00,468 --> 00:01:02,701
<i>Jane used it to create
a time loop.</i>

32
00:01:02,736 --> 00:01:06,305
<i>In each loop,
Jane alters something</i>

33
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,706
to see if it'll
change the outcome.

34
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:08,807
What's different this time?

35
00:01:08,843 --> 00:01:09,843
I was at Brakebills.

36
00:01:09,877 --> 00:01:10,917
You were supposed to be.

37
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:13,445
Or you were, like, 39 times.

38
00:01:13,481 --> 00:01:14,847
You were the thing they changed.

39
00:01:22,389 --> 00:01:25,190
Very impressive, Ms. Wicker.

40
00:01:25,226 --> 00:01:26,425
Let me do it again.

41
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,760
I was wondering
what would happen

42
00:01:28,796 --> 00:01:32,731
if I connected the sequence with
Atsuko's Spectral Refraction.

43
00:01:32,766 --> 00:01:33,832
All right.

44
00:01:50,751 --> 00:01:53,418
That is a second year spell.

45
00:01:53,454 --> 00:01:54,753
I--I read ahead.

46
00:01:54,788 --> 00:01:56,922
More than that, you--

47
00:01:56,957 --> 00:01:59,758
you understood the theory
behind the spell, and--

48
00:01:59,793 --> 00:02:02,394
and you reshaped it.

49
00:02:02,429 --> 00:02:05,197
Your discipline is
meta-composition.

50
00:02:05,232 --> 00:02:07,533
You are a Knowledge student.

51
00:02:07,568 --> 00:02:09,935
- Knowledge?
- Part psychic, part physical.

52
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,571
There really is no branch
it doesn't touch on.

53
00:02:12,606 --> 00:02:14,907
The short version:
you are drawn,

54
00:02:14,942 --> 00:02:18,477
mind and body,
to the discovery of magic.

55
00:02:18,512 --> 00:02:21,246
Is it true that they--
um, well that we--

56
00:02:21,282 --> 00:02:23,348
live in the attic
above the Library?

57
00:02:23,384 --> 00:02:26,818
I assure you it is much more
luxurious than it sounds.

58
00:02:26,854 --> 00:02:28,787
No, I mean, it sounds
like bliss, actually.

59
00:02:28,822 --> 00:02:31,490
I enjoyed it.

60
00:02:31,525 --> 00:02:32,691
You were a Knowledge student?

61
00:02:32,726 --> 00:02:34,259
I am a Knowledge student.

62
00:02:34,295 --> 00:02:36,528
It doesn't end with your degree.

63
00:02:36,564 --> 00:02:38,297
You have a rare gift, Julia,

64
00:02:38,332 --> 00:02:42,534
and I must admit I'm envious
of the many rich discoveries

65
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,403
that you have ahead of you.

66
00:02:44,438 --> 00:02:45,704
Welcome.

67
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:48,807
Thank you.

68
00:03:05,593 --> 00:03:07,893
You are free to go.

69
00:03:07,928 --> 00:03:09,494
Why would you let me go?

70
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,830
Because, Ms. Wicker,

71
00:03:11,865 --> 00:03:13,599
you are not a student here,

72
00:03:13,634 --> 00:03:15,867
and I'm not running a jail.

73
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:19,371
Kady locked me up
for a good reason.

74
00:03:19,406 --> 00:03:21,573
I should feel terrible

75
00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:23,008
about what I did.

76
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,879
But I don't.

77
00:03:27,915 --> 00:03:30,749
I just think it's terrible,

78
00:03:30,784 --> 00:03:34,419
and I think I would've never
done it if I were me.

79
00:03:34,455 --> 00:03:36,888
One thing I've learned
about you, Ms. Wicker,

80
00:03:36,924 --> 00:03:39,491
is that you are a searcher.

81
00:03:42,363 --> 00:03:44,029
You don't know me.

82
00:03:44,064 --> 00:03:47,599
39 times I've known you.

83
00:03:47,635 --> 00:03:50,469
Which is why I trust that
you'll put aside your fear

84
00:03:50,504 --> 00:03:52,471
and self-pity

85
00:03:52,506 --> 00:03:55,540
and look for the answers
that can save you.

86
00:04:00,414 --> 00:04:02,581
Why am I the only one
worried about this wedding?

87
00:04:06,787 --> 00:04:09,388
Congratulations.
You failed.

88
00:04:09,423 --> 00:04:12,057
Oh, hey, hey, um,

89
00:04:12,092 --> 00:04:13,592
King needs more wine.

90
00:04:13,627 --> 00:04:15,494
Of course, sire.

91
00:04:15,529 --> 00:04:17,062
I feel bad;
I forgot your name.

92
00:04:17,097 --> 00:04:19,064
It's Smedley, sire.

93
00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:20,932
Smedley.
Thanks, Smedley.

94
00:04:20,968 --> 00:04:23,635
Hey. I'll take that.

95
00:04:23,671 --> 00:04:25,904
Oh, no, wait, I'm--
I'm not done.

96
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:28,707
I think you were.

97
00:04:28,742 --> 00:04:29,975
Not cool.

98
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,577
Those grapes died
for nothing now.

99
00:04:32,613 --> 00:04:34,980
Those grapes died
so you might live.

100
00:04:35,015 --> 00:04:36,615
Because if you keep drinking,

101
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,917
I will seriously cut a bitch.

102
00:04:38,952 --> 00:04:40,819
You never yell at Eliot
for being drunk.

103
00:04:40,854 --> 00:04:42,521
Because Eliot's fun.

104
00:04:42,556 --> 00:04:45,324
You're depressing.
It's been three months.

105
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:48,493
Technically, it's only been
a couple of days on Earth, so...

106
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:50,429
Three months on Fillory

107
00:04:50,464 --> 00:04:52,864
of emo Quentin.

108
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,766
Not my favorite Quentin.

109
00:04:54,802 --> 00:04:57,803
I didn't know that you liked
any of the Quentins.

110
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:01,606
I had to let Alice go.

111
00:05:01,642 --> 00:05:04,109
I'm...

112
00:05:04,144 --> 00:05:05,677
sympathetic.

113
00:05:05,713 --> 00:05:06,878
Okay?

114
00:05:06,914 --> 00:05:08,580
But meanwhile,

115
00:05:08,615 --> 00:05:11,683
Groomzilla is suddenly
my full-time job.

116
00:05:11,719 --> 00:05:12,984
I need your help.

117
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,721
Bambi!
This is an emergency.

118
00:05:15,756 --> 00:05:17,456
These are all wrong.

119
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:19,825
You're banished forever.
Thank you.

120
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,894
He's just so mean
when he needs things.

121
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:25,564
Eliot needs a friend, asshole.

122
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:27,566
It's your turn to be button boy

123
00:05:27,601 --> 00:05:29,868
and run his random
Earth errands.

124
00:05:29,903 --> 00:05:31,937
I need a free moment

125
00:05:31,972 --> 00:05:34,606
to rub one out in a hot bath

126
00:05:34,641 --> 00:05:37,476
before I fucking kill someone.

127
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:39,878
That someone being you.

128
00:05:41,148 --> 00:05:42,647
Message received.

129
00:05:42,683 --> 00:05:46,051
And get your feet off my throne.

130
00:05:50,457 --> 00:05:52,057
This is insane.
Why the fuck would Fogg

131
00:05:52,092 --> 00:05:53,092
let Julia go?

132
00:05:53,127 --> 00:05:54,126
Haven't you ever noticed?

133
00:05:54,161 --> 00:05:55,827
Fogg isn't that helpful.

134
00:05:55,863 --> 00:05:57,896
Plus, you knew he couldn't
keep her in there forever.

135
00:05:57,931 --> 00:05:59,998
Yeah, well, I thought
she'd at least be in there

136
00:06:00,033 --> 00:06:02,567
long enough for us to figure out
what to do next.

137
00:06:02,603 --> 00:06:03,935
Where are you going?

138
00:06:03,971 --> 00:06:07,205
I still have Reynard
to deal with.

139
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:09,441
And I really don't want
to run into Julia.

140
00:06:09,476 --> 00:06:10,675
Fine, let's go.

141
00:06:10,711 --> 00:06:11,977
Okay, no.

142
00:06:12,012 --> 00:06:14,880
Penny, Reynard is my problem.

143
00:06:14,915 --> 00:06:16,181
We've been over this.

144
00:06:16,216 --> 00:06:18,984
Rapist monsters are
a universal problem.

145
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:20,719
And the last time
you tried to help,

146
00:06:20,754 --> 00:06:24,122
you signed, like, a billion-year
contract with The Order.

147
00:06:25,726 --> 00:06:27,025
When does that start,
by the way?

148
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,794
Not today.

149
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:31,129
Takes 'em four weeks to process
a book request.

150
00:06:31,165 --> 00:06:32,798
Let's go.

151
00:06:41,742 --> 00:06:43,975
Uh...

152
00:06:44,011 --> 00:06:46,678
where are we?

153
00:06:46,713 --> 00:06:49,014
Penny, we've processed
your application

154
00:06:49,049 --> 00:06:51,583
and would like to formally
welcome you to The Order.

155
00:06:53,754 --> 00:06:55,921
Shit.

156
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:05,931
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny
www.addic7ed.com</font>

157
00:07:05,966 --> 00:07:08,767
Congratulations!

158
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,875
Kady, we've allowed you here
to assist in Penny's transition.

159
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,710
But I'm afraid I'm not allowed
to discuss the business

160
00:07:18,745 --> 00:07:20,045
of The Order with you present.

161
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,047
Yeah, fine.
I'll fuck off.

162
00:07:22,082 --> 00:07:24,082
Uh, no eating or drinking
in the Library

163
00:07:24,117 --> 00:07:25,317
except where posted.

164
00:07:26,854 --> 00:07:28,887
Now, Penny,

165
00:07:28,922 --> 00:07:32,190
we need to go over some
of your...obligations.

166
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:36,161
I just don't get it.

167
00:07:36,196 --> 00:07:38,129
I mean, I did head off
a famine--

168
00:07:38,165 --> 00:07:40,232
personally staved off a war.

169
00:07:40,267 --> 00:07:42,067
Not to mention, The Wellspring
is back online.

170
00:07:42,102 --> 00:07:44,703
And yet the people don't like me
any more than they did.

171
00:07:44,738 --> 00:07:47,105
How can you possibly know
what they actually think of you?

172
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,008
There's this Earth magician,
Nate Silver.

173
00:07:50,043 --> 00:07:53,011
I adapted one of his
polling spells.

174
00:07:53,046 --> 00:07:56,314
Right now, my approval rating
is at 26%,

175
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,283
which is not good, Bayler.

176
00:07:58,318 --> 00:07:59,684
Not at all.

177
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,320
But still, why ask me?

178
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:05,023
Mmm, I don't know.

179
00:08:05,058 --> 00:08:07,325
I figured you might know
why they hate me so much,

180
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,327
seeing as you tried
to murder me.

181
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:12,030
Okay, that was before
I got to know you.

182
00:08:12,065 --> 00:08:15,967
And before you introduced me
to this Earth delicacy--

183
00:08:16,003 --> 00:08:17,335
na-chos.

184
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:20,805
Wait till you try
your first margarita.

185
00:08:20,841 --> 00:08:22,941
Mmm.

186
00:08:22,976 --> 00:08:24,843
Listen...

187
00:08:24,878 --> 00:08:27,679
If you're really worried about
what the people think of you,

188
00:08:27,714 --> 00:08:28,914
let's talk about your wedding.

189
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:31,082
Ugh.
Can we not?

190
00:08:31,118 --> 00:08:32,617
Historically,

191
00:08:32,653 --> 00:08:35,654
a royal wedding is the perfect
time for a monarch

192
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:37,122
to make their appeal
to the people.

193
00:08:37,157 --> 00:08:39,090
Idri prefers a private ceremony.

194
00:08:39,126 --> 00:08:41,059
But what if you went public?

195
00:08:41,094 --> 00:08:43,194
Might improve your polling.

196
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:49,100
One for $20, three for $50.

197
00:08:49,136 --> 00:08:52,070
Which gets you the highest?

198
00:08:52,105 --> 00:08:53,939
Highest?

199
00:08:53,974 --> 00:08:56,975
This is grown locally
from heirloom seed stock,

200
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,945
paired with the ideal pastry
for a curated drug experience.

201
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,313
This will make you levitate.

202
00:09:01,348 --> 00:09:03,748
This is like being
hugged by a rainbow.

203
00:09:03,784 --> 00:09:06,051
This is like being
blown by a rainbow.

204
00:09:06,086 --> 00:09:07,285
Do not mix these up.

205
00:09:07,321 --> 00:09:08,720
Yeah, I'll take six.

206
00:09:11,358 --> 00:09:14,793
So the High King needs me?

207
00:09:14,828 --> 00:09:17,896
Yes, he asked
for you specifically.

208
00:09:17,931 --> 00:09:19,664
A command performance.

209
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,267
Righteous.

210
00:09:22,302 --> 00:09:23,835
How are--
how are you doing?

211
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,171
The last time I saw you,
you weren't...

212
00:09:26,206 --> 00:09:28,106
doing so good.

213
00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:29,941
Whatever happened with
the whole, uh--

214
00:09:29,977 --> 00:09:31,142
I let her go.

215
00:09:31,178 --> 00:09:33,044
I'm fine.

216
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,879
I've been self-medicating, so--

217
00:09:34,915 --> 00:09:36,848
uh, they don't have
Abilify in Fillory,

218
00:09:36,883 --> 00:09:39,217
but I have been improvising.

219
00:09:39,252 --> 00:09:43,221
Well, this is Dr. Josh's
prescription.

220
00:09:43,256 --> 00:09:45,857
I mean, we don't have
to race off to Fillory

221
00:09:45,892 --> 00:09:48,226
right this second.

222
00:09:48,261 --> 00:09:49,894
We have a minute.
What's it do?

223
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:52,931
Dude, lets you see
into other worlds.

224
00:09:52,966 --> 00:09:54,165
It's rad.

225
00:10:02,743 --> 00:10:04,175
This<i> is</i> rad.

226
00:10:18,358 --> 00:10:20,725
Is that you...

227
00:10:20,761 --> 00:10:23,361
Quentin?

228
00:10:23,397 --> 00:10:25,830
Um...

229
00:10:25,866 --> 00:10:28,767
you look familiar.

230
00:10:28,802 --> 00:10:31,903
Holy shit, Julia?

231
00:10:31,938 --> 00:10:33,938
Why do you look
like a 12-year-old?

232
00:10:33,974 --> 00:10:35,907
Because I'm her Shade.

233
00:10:38,378 --> 00:10:41,446
Oh, Q, I'm so happy
to see you again.

234
00:10:41,481 --> 00:10:43,281
I really, really missed you.

235
00:10:43,316 --> 00:10:44,783
Her Shade?

236
00:10:44,818 --> 00:10:46,951
I thought that you were gone.

237
00:10:46,987 --> 00:10:48,286
I'm lost.

238
00:10:48,321 --> 00:10:50,221
I can't find my way home.

239
00:10:51,925 --> 00:10:53,725
This is getting less rad.

240
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,193
Please, Quentin.

241
00:10:55,228 --> 00:10:57,195
I've been looking for a way out,
and then...

242
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,998
suddenly I could see you.

243
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:02,100
Yeah, you're in another world.

244
00:11:02,135 --> 00:11:03,835
Um...

245
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,036
where are you?

246
00:11:05,072 --> 00:11:07,972
I have no idea.

247
00:11:08,008 --> 00:11:09,274
I can't stay here.

248
00:11:09,309 --> 00:11:10,508
Time is running out.

249
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:12,477
- Can you help me?
- Yeah, I'll try.

250
00:11:12,512 --> 00:11:13,778
H-how can I find you?

251
00:11:13,814 --> 00:11:15,013
I don't know.

252
00:11:15,048 --> 00:11:16,514
I don't even know
how I got here.

253
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,183
Please, Quentin.

254
00:11:18,218 --> 00:11:20,318
I have to get back to Julia.

255
00:11:20,353 --> 00:11:22,520
You have to find me
before it's too late.

256
00:11:42,572 --> 00:11:44,019
Holy shit, are we at war?

257
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:45,574
I wish we were at war.

258
00:11:45,609 --> 00:11:47,643
These are the place settings
for the wedding.

259
00:11:47,678 --> 00:11:49,411
Much more dangerous.

260
00:11:49,447 --> 00:11:51,213
How's Josh doing in
the royal kitchens?

261
00:11:51,248 --> 00:11:53,082
Uh...

262
00:11:53,117 --> 00:11:56,318
he's declared them "adequate."

263
00:11:56,353 --> 00:11:58,087
Eliot, I have to go
back to Earth.

264
00:11:58,122 --> 00:11:59,321
Don't be ridiculous.

265
00:11:59,356 --> 00:12:01,290
You have far too much
to do here.

266
00:12:01,325 --> 00:12:02,925
I had a vision, okay?

267
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,662
A way that I can
maybe help Julia.

268
00:12:08,099 --> 00:12:10,299
I can't ignore it.

269
00:12:10,334 --> 00:12:11,667
Can't you?

270
00:12:11,702 --> 00:12:14,603
It was a motherfucking
vision, El.

271
00:12:14,638 --> 00:12:16,205
Look, I don't know
how else to say it.

272
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,639
I just--I feel like this
is something that I--

273
00:12:17,675 --> 00:12:19,374
I have to do right now.

274
00:12:22,346 --> 00:12:23,545
I can see that.

275
00:12:25,683 --> 00:12:28,183
Yeah.

276
00:12:28,219 --> 00:12:32,087
If you miss my wedding,
I will kill you.

277
00:12:32,123 --> 00:12:34,189
- Okay.
- Okay.

278
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,995
Hey, uh, can you help me
find some information?

279
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,230
Of course.

280
00:12:41,265 --> 00:12:42,498
What are you looking for?

281
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:44,032
Well, say you have a--

282
00:12:44,068 --> 00:12:46,668
a being with an enormous
amount of power.

283
00:12:46,704 --> 00:12:49,738
I'm looking for how
someone might...

284
00:12:49,773 --> 00:12:51,507
you know, defeat them.

285
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:53,208
How much power?

286
00:12:53,244 --> 00:12:55,644
Let's say...
god-like?

287
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,312
So classical myths?

288
00:12:57,348 --> 00:13:00,983
No, more like a how-to manual.

289
00:13:01,018 --> 00:13:02,351
Let me check upstairs.

290
00:13:17,735 --> 00:13:19,234
So do we just wait?

291
00:13:26,243 --> 00:13:27,442
Oh.

292
00:13:34,685 --> 00:13:36,018
I'm afraid we don't have
any books available

293
00:13:36,053 --> 00:13:37,619
on that particular topic.

294
00:13:37,655 --> 00:13:41,790
There's nothing in the entire
Library of the Neitherlands

295
00:13:41,825 --> 00:13:43,659
on killing any kind of god?

296
00:13:43,694 --> 00:13:45,494
Have you considered that it
might not be strictly possible

297
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:47,329
to do so?

298
00:13:47,364 --> 00:13:50,165
Didn't the Norse Gods kill
each other, like, all the time?

299
00:13:50,201 --> 00:13:52,067
The Library is full of stories.

300
00:13:52,102 --> 00:13:53,368
It happened.

301
00:13:53,404 --> 00:13:54,570
I know it has.

302
00:13:54,605 --> 00:13:56,705
In Fillory,
The Beast killed Umber.

303
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,607
Sounds fascinating.

304
00:13:58,642 --> 00:14:00,475
Unfortunately, there is no
written record

305
00:14:00,511 --> 00:14:03,679
of the type you seek regarding
the mechanics of such an event.

306
00:14:03,714 --> 00:14:05,214
Terribly sorry.

307
00:14:15,359 --> 00:14:18,627
Struck out looking
for a god-murder spell.

308
00:14:18,662 --> 00:14:21,296
It can't be that no one
in all of history ever--

309
00:14:21,332 --> 00:14:23,532
Well, apparently,
no one ever wrote it down.

310
00:14:25,302 --> 00:14:26,501
Look, if a way exists,

311
00:14:26,537 --> 00:14:27,736
I'm finding it.

312
00:14:27,771 --> 00:14:29,438
So what's up with your hands?

313
00:14:29,473 --> 00:14:31,740
They told me there are
books to help me,

314
00:14:31,775 --> 00:14:35,611
but I'd have to do the research
on my own time.

315
00:14:35,646 --> 00:14:38,347
Seriously? What are you
supposed to do in the meantime?

316
00:14:38,382 --> 00:14:41,183
My job.

317
00:14:41,218 --> 00:14:43,385
Apparently, I track down
overdue books,

318
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:47,322
and this one has been checked
out for over ten years.

319
00:14:47,358 --> 00:14:48,590
You got to be kidding.

320
00:14:48,626 --> 00:14:51,393
Since I still can't cast,

321
00:14:51,428 --> 00:14:53,829
I thought you could help me out
with a little locator spell?

322
00:15:07,177 --> 00:15:08,243
My King.

323
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:09,478
Hi, Fen.

324
00:15:11,348 --> 00:15:12,581
Are you all right?

325
00:15:12,616 --> 00:15:16,151
Yes, fine.
How go the wedding preparations?

326
00:15:16,186 --> 00:15:19,321
Oh... they're fine.

327
00:15:19,356 --> 00:15:20,889
Is there anything
I can help with?

328
00:15:23,294 --> 00:15:27,763
Is that something that you'd
actually want to help with?

329
00:15:27,798 --> 00:15:30,265
You're acting like you think
I'd disapprove of it.

330
00:15:30,301 --> 00:15:33,802
Your husband is about to
welcome another husband

331
00:15:33,837 --> 00:15:35,604
into his bed.

332
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:37,339
You're a king.

333
00:15:37,374 --> 00:15:39,174
Of course you will.

334
00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:42,644
I gather a three-person marriage
isn't normal on Earth?

335
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,881
Not outside of Utah.

336
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:47,349
Or some websites.

337
00:15:47,384 --> 00:15:51,286
Those are cities
made of pixels, right?

338
00:15:51,322 --> 00:15:52,621
Close.

339
00:15:52,656 --> 00:15:55,724
My mission,
so you understand it,

340
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,226
is to protect our
growing family.

341
00:15:58,262 --> 00:16:00,629
Your marriage to Idri means
a stronger kingdom

342
00:16:00,664 --> 00:16:02,397
to raise our child in.

343
00:16:02,433 --> 00:16:04,566
You are being way more
understanding about this

344
00:16:04,601 --> 00:16:06,601
than I would be in your shoes.

345
00:16:06,637 --> 00:16:08,203
That's my job.

346
00:16:10,741 --> 00:16:14,176
Look, I'm gonna go talk
to my royal chef.

347
00:16:14,211 --> 00:16:15,711
Care to join?

348
00:16:15,746 --> 00:16:16,812
Thanks.

349
00:16:16,847 --> 00:16:19,414
I'm... not feeling good.

350
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,450
It's morning sickness.

351
00:16:58,355 --> 00:17:00,322
Q, leave.

352
00:17:00,357 --> 00:17:01,357
I'm not going anywhere.

353
00:17:01,392 --> 00:17:02,624
Just open the door.

354
00:17:04,595 --> 00:17:06,495
Fuck, I could've--

355
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:07,729
I could've killed you.

356
00:17:10,701 --> 00:17:13,702
You know, I never--
I never once stopped to ask

357
00:17:13,737 --> 00:17:15,537
if I was doing the right thing.

358
00:17:18,475 --> 00:17:20,509
And now it's all I ask.

359
00:17:23,013 --> 00:17:25,514
If I did this,

360
00:17:25,549 --> 00:17:27,549
would Q look at me
like I'm evil?

361
00:17:32,423 --> 00:17:34,356
I can't...

362
00:17:34,391 --> 00:17:37,025
really feel any of it anymore.

363
00:17:38,862 --> 00:17:40,829
I'm doing it from memory.

364
00:17:45,302 --> 00:17:47,269
I'm broken.

365
00:17:47,304 --> 00:17:49,604
And that makes me dangerous.

366
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,507
So you should go.

367
00:17:52,543 --> 00:17:55,043
Jules...

368
00:17:55,078 --> 00:17:57,379
I talked to your Shade.

369
00:18:01,485 --> 00:18:04,653
Wait, so you saw her in a--

370
00:18:04,688 --> 00:18:07,823
Yeah, uh, I mean,
there were drugs involved.

371
00:18:07,858 --> 00:18:09,724
But I--I know that it was real.

372
00:18:10,994 --> 00:18:12,427
And she's still alive?

373
00:18:12,463 --> 00:18:14,029
Yeah.

374
00:18:14,064 --> 00:18:15,764
Well, I don't really know
if that term applies here,

375
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:17,332
but she's not gone.

376
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:22,370
So where is she?

377
00:18:22,406 --> 00:18:24,639
I don't know.

378
00:18:24,675 --> 00:18:26,541
But wherever she is,

379
00:18:26,577 --> 00:18:28,343
she wants us to find her.

380
00:18:31,915 --> 00:18:34,516
- What is this?
- Culinary classic.

381
00:18:34,551 --> 00:18:37,919
Oysters and pearls
from the French Laundry.

382
00:18:37,955 --> 00:18:39,955
I had to get Thomas Keller
so wrecked

383
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,957
before he'd show me
the secret to that recipe.

384
00:18:47,397 --> 00:18:50,432
Mmm.

385
00:18:50,467 --> 00:18:53,468
I just don't think
it's "Fillory" enough.

386
00:18:53,504 --> 00:18:56,638
But half of Fillory
eats boiled mutton.

387
00:18:56,673 --> 00:18:58,507
Let's introduce them to,
like, actual food.

388
00:18:58,542 --> 00:18:59,941
This is their world.

389
00:18:59,977 --> 00:19:01,843
We have to meet them halfway,
don't you think?

390
00:19:01,879 --> 00:19:03,512
Well, if half your recipe
is shit,

391
00:19:03,547 --> 00:19:04,980
it's all going to taste
like shit.

392
00:19:05,015 --> 00:19:06,948
Okay, okay.
Fine, fine.

393
00:19:06,984 --> 00:19:08,717
Forget the dish.

394
00:19:08,752 --> 00:19:11,920
Let's start with, "What do you
want people to feel

395
00:19:11,955 --> 00:19:13,822
when they eat it?"

396
00:19:13,857 --> 00:19:16,525
I want everyone to like me.

397
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,426
Then let's just make this easy.

398
00:19:18,462 --> 00:19:20,695
I'll make a potion.
Poof!

399
00:19:20,731 --> 00:19:22,130
They'll like you!

400
00:19:22,165 --> 00:19:24,566
- Donesies!
- I need this.

401
00:19:29,907 --> 00:19:31,373
There's nothing in here either.

402
00:19:31,408 --> 00:19:32,707
Got to keep looking.

403
00:19:32,743 --> 00:19:35,577
So scratchy.

404
00:19:35,612 --> 00:19:37,612
Go away, Todd.

405
00:19:37,648 --> 00:19:40,015
Stuff about the afterlife
is super wonky.

406
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,517
It's too close to religion.

407
00:19:42,553 --> 00:19:45,554
It's--it's hard to figure out
what's not a flat-out lie.

408
00:19:45,589 --> 00:19:46,621
Right?

409
00:19:46,657 --> 00:19:49,491
Hey, is this place real?

410
00:19:51,662 --> 00:19:52,961
No.

411
00:19:55,532 --> 00:19:56,998
You're hungover, Todd.

412
00:19:58,435 --> 00:20:00,402
Look, I found a passage here.

413
00:20:00,437 --> 00:20:03,104
Sort of vague,
but it mentions Shades.

414
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,873
One passage in a dozen books?

415
00:20:04,908 --> 00:20:08,009
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, Shades.

416
00:20:08,045 --> 00:20:09,177
I mean, something.

417
00:20:09,212 --> 00:20:10,712
Nobody talks about Shades.

418
00:20:10,747 --> 00:20:11,746
There's got to be a reason.

419
00:20:11,782 --> 00:20:13,415
I know, right?

420
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:17,485
I mean, when Fogg talked
about 'em the other day,

421
00:20:17,521 --> 00:20:20,055
it was the first
I heard about 'em.

422
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,825
What?

423
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:27,796
My work study job--
I type up Fogg's memoirs.

424
00:20:27,831 --> 00:20:30,732
I guess he has, like,
a crazy book deal.

425
00:20:30,767 --> 00:20:32,734
He's led a seriously weird life.

426
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:35,971
Did you know that
he and Bob Ross

427
00:20:36,006 --> 00:20:39,074
had a dark artistic rivalry,
and--

428
00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:40,642
What did he say about Shades?

429
00:20:42,045 --> 00:20:44,813
Something like he knew someone

430
00:20:44,848 --> 00:20:47,182
who was obsessed with them?

431
00:20:47,217 --> 00:20:50,151
I do know--
or I suppose I knew

432
00:20:50,187 --> 00:20:52,621
someone who was
interested in Shades--

433
00:20:52,656 --> 00:20:53,955
was.

434
00:20:53,991 --> 00:20:56,524
Ah, it's rather confusing.

435
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,464
Confusing why?

436
00:20:57,584 --> 00:20:59,628
Because you know her too.

437
00:20:59,663 --> 00:21:00,996
It's Alice.

438
00:21:06,301 --> 00:21:08,769
Honestly, I don't think that
she knew anything about Shades.

439
00:21:08,805 --> 00:21:09,805
No, of course not.

440
00:21:10,101 --> 00:21:11,601
That Alice didn't.

441
00:21:11,636 --> 00:21:13,269
This Alice is a different story.

442
00:21:13,304 --> 00:21:14,771
What do you mean "this" Alice?

443
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:17,340
Do you recall the time loop
I told you about?

444
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:19,208
The 39 lifetimes?

445
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:21,077
No one remembers them except me.

446
00:21:21,112 --> 00:21:22,712
Yeah, of course.
You knew another me.

447
00:21:22,747 --> 00:21:24,580
The Alice from the 23rd timeline

448
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,150
was the sole survivor
of The Beast.

449
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:30,253
She became obsessed
with the afterlife,

450
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:33,389
how to commune with lost souls,

451
00:21:33,424 --> 00:21:35,091
and Shades.

452
00:21:35,126 --> 00:21:38,661
Would she know
where one would go?

453
00:21:38,696 --> 00:21:40,096
I don't know what she knew.

454
00:21:40,131 --> 00:21:41,631
She just talked
about them a lot.

455
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:44,333
She was different
than your Alice.

456
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:47,336
She was hurt--broken.

457
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:48,738
We need to talk to her.

458
00:21:48,773 --> 00:21:51,174
Well, you can't.
It's already happened.

459
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:54,777
Essentially in another universe.

460
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:58,281
It's gone.

461
00:21:58,316 --> 00:22:00,316
Well, what about
a Tesla Flexion?

462
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,421
What is it?

463
00:22:05,456 --> 00:22:07,557
It's how we could talk to her.

464
00:22:13,731 --> 00:22:15,331
Can I ask you a woman question?

465
00:22:15,366 --> 00:22:18,234
Ugh. I barely
understand women.

466
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:19,735
I think my pregnant wife

467
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:23,105
might be having weird
pregnant wife feelings.

468
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:24,340
Ew.

469
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:25,875
Definitely not my rice bowl.

470
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:30,346
She just seems like
her head is elsewhere

471
00:22:30,381 --> 00:22:31,647
all the time.

472
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:32,648
What do you mean?

473
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,250
Every time I run into her,

474
00:22:34,285 --> 00:22:36,352
I feel like I'm interrupting
a conversation.

475
00:22:36,387 --> 00:22:38,287
Except there's
no one else there.

476
00:22:47,298 --> 00:22:49,832
What is it?

477
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:52,335
Nothing.

478
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,237
I need some air.

479
00:23:02,747 --> 00:23:04,647
Fuzzbeat?

480
00:23:04,682 --> 00:23:06,249
It's, like, a website.

481
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:08,517
They do serious news
and cat videos at the same time.

482
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,186
That's fucking dumb.

483
00:23:10,221 --> 00:23:12,141
Well, it's where the tracking
spell said to go.

484
00:23:14,592 --> 00:23:16,359
We're looking for Harriet.

485
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:17,894
And you are?

486
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:19,762
Just tell we're from The Order.

487
00:23:19,797 --> 00:23:22,531
Is that the new Pilates place?

488
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,200
- Yes.
- Sweet.

489
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,842
That's a fucking unicorn
in a tutu.

490
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:43,252
We're here for the book.

491
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:45,655
"Principles of Conjuring
Elementals."

492
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,790
It's ten years overdue.

493
00:23:48,826 --> 00:23:50,393
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

494
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:53,262
She's not casting.

495
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:54,764
She's signing.

496
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,766
Oh.

497
00:23:56,801 --> 00:23:58,467
Yeah, I--I don't--
I don't speak that.

498
00:23:58,503 --> 00:24:00,670
She said we don't
look like librarians.

499
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:03,239
All right, well, you know,

500
00:24:03,274 --> 00:24:04,774
tell her we're looking
for the book.

501
00:24:06,811 --> 00:24:09,445
We need that book back.

502
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,646
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

503
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:12,782
Your signing is terrible.

504
00:24:12,817 --> 00:24:16,619
Yeah, my signing's
a little rusty.

505
00:24:32,537 --> 00:24:35,438
- What'd she say?
- Uh, don't worry about it.

506
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:39,342
So what's your deal?

507
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:43,779
You write listicles, and you do
magic in your spare time?

508
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:44,847
No.

509
00:24:44,882 --> 00:24:46,816
This is my magic.

510
00:24:46,851 --> 00:24:48,517
What are you talking about?

511
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:49,919
Your clickbait site?

512
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,726
Yeah, right.

513
00:24:56,761 --> 00:24:59,528
- What the fuck is she saying?
- Shh.

514
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:00,930
See for yourself.

515
00:25:03,067 --> 00:25:06,535
"18 Pandas With Things
That Look Like Pandas"?

516
00:25:06,571 --> 00:25:08,337
Half of those don't
even look like pandas.

517
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:16,512
That's how to conjure
dark matter!

518
00:25:16,547 --> 00:25:18,047
What did you do to the pandas?

519
00:25:18,082 --> 00:25:20,049
It's an encoded spell.

520
00:25:20,084 --> 00:25:21,484
All these articles are.

521
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:25,454
Wait, wait, how about--

522
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,490
how about "Drunk Guys
Eating Kids' Vitamins"?

523
00:25:32,663 --> 00:25:34,663
No! Really?

524
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,399
- Oh, my God, that's--
- Yeah, when you guys

525
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:38,434
are done bonding, do you think
you could ask her

526
00:25:38,469 --> 00:25:39,869
for the book now, please?

527
00:25:39,904 --> 00:25:42,371
Relax, kid.

528
00:25:42,407 --> 00:25:44,573
I'll find it.

529
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:45,609
Oh.

530
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:48,644
Mm!

531
00:25:48,679 --> 00:25:49,745
Just give us a sec.

532
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:57,086
So I don't get it.
Why do all this?

533
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,863
You're not wrong.

534
00:26:10,134 --> 00:26:13,369
Well, I was looking
for the kind of knowledge

535
00:26:13,404 --> 00:26:14,937
the Library doesn't have.

536
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:18,541
Oh, the usual--
beauty tips, recipes,

537
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:20,009
how to kill a trickster god.

538
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:29,552
Ah.

539
00:26:43,367 --> 00:26:46,001
- Here you go.
- Finally.

540
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:47,436
Let's go.

541
00:26:47,472 --> 00:26:49,438
- Have a nice day.
- Fuck off.

542
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:01,951
Thank you.

543
00:27:12,218 --> 00:27:14,465
Why am I staring at a plate
of half-eaten nachos?

544
00:27:14,581 --> 00:27:17,119
A question I've asked myself
very often at 3:00 a.m.

545
00:27:17,239 --> 00:27:20,274
- So I was doing the dishes--
- You're supposed to be cooking.

546
00:27:20,394 --> 00:27:21,735
I know. I...

547
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:24,471
kind of roofied the dishwasher.

548
00:27:24,506 --> 00:27:27,708
Um, that is not okay.

549
00:27:27,743 --> 00:27:30,477
No, not "roofied" roofied.

550
00:27:30,512 --> 00:27:32,646
Uh, more like he loves
everyone so much,

551
00:27:32,681 --> 00:27:33,847
he's catatonic.

552
00:27:33,882 --> 00:27:35,115
It was an accident.

553
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:38,085
I was testing
the potion for you.

554
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,387
Might have made it
a little too strong.

555
00:27:40,422 --> 00:27:41,922
Forget it.
Doesn't matter.

556
00:27:41,957 --> 00:27:44,725
The point is, I found this.

557
00:27:49,865 --> 00:27:53,033
"Wedding day.
Western gate unguarded.

558
00:27:53,068 --> 00:27:55,502
Bring gifts there."

559
00:27:55,537 --> 00:27:58,405
I'm assuming they're not talking
about actual gifts.

560
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,873
No.

561
00:27:59,908 --> 00:28:01,742
They're talking about
chopping our heads off.

562
00:28:01,777 --> 00:28:02,909
Ooh.

563
00:28:02,945 --> 00:28:05,679
That backgammon-playing prick.

564
00:28:05,714 --> 00:28:07,914
Ah! I was so stupid.

565
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,983
After all the hours I spent
down in the dungeon,

566
00:28:10,019 --> 00:28:11,952
I actually thought
I'd won Bayler over.

567
00:28:11,987 --> 00:28:13,854
I thought I had
rehabbed his soul.

568
00:28:13,889 --> 00:28:15,722
Oh, honey.

569
00:28:15,758 --> 00:28:19,559
We both know rehab is about more
than nachos and backgammon.

570
00:28:19,595 --> 00:28:20,794
Is it?

571
00:28:20,829 --> 00:28:22,696
Is it, Margo?

572
00:28:22,731 --> 00:28:25,932
Wait, so you're upset because
the guy who tried to kill you

573
00:28:25,968 --> 00:28:28,435
is gonna try and kill you again?

574
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,670
I should've executed him.

575
00:28:29,705 --> 00:28:30,671
It's not like anybody
likes me anyway.

576
00:28:30,706 --> 00:28:32,105
I'm down 5%.

577
00:28:32,141 --> 00:28:34,741
And now the Fu Fighters
are gonna red my wedding!

578
00:28:34,777 --> 00:28:35,976
No.

579
00:28:36,011 --> 00:28:38,011
Okay? We won't let that happen.

580
00:28:39,181 --> 00:28:40,914
Josh, where's that dishwasher?

581
00:28:40,949 --> 00:28:41,915
Still in the armoire.

582
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:43,817
Why is he in the armoire?

583
00:28:43,852 --> 00:28:45,952
'Cause I'm not good
in a crisis, okay?

584
00:28:45,988 --> 00:28:48,955
How were you ever a drug dealer?

585
00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:53,894
Look, that note was meant
for the dishwasher.

586
00:28:53,929 --> 00:28:56,463
He's probably been passing
messages to the Fu Fighters

587
00:28:56,498 --> 00:28:58,398
this whole time,
so here's what we do.

588
00:28:58,434 --> 00:29:00,000
We help him sober up,
and then--

589
00:29:00,035 --> 00:29:01,768
We execute him.

590
00:29:01,804 --> 00:29:03,203
No.

591
00:29:03,238 --> 00:29:06,006
But it means so much to me
that you want to.

592
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,876
We put the note back
into the dirty dishes.

593
00:29:09,912 --> 00:29:13,480
We let him find it and take it
back to the Fu Fighters' base.

594
00:29:13,515 --> 00:29:14,681
Josh?

595
00:29:14,717 --> 00:29:16,483
How much of that potion
can you make?

596
00:29:16,518 --> 00:29:18,618
I--I don't know.
A buttload?

597
00:29:18,654 --> 00:29:19,853
That'll do.

598
00:29:23,158 --> 00:29:25,125
Bambi, what are you casting?

599
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,160
Tracking spell.

600
00:29:27,196 --> 00:29:28,862
Then we'll know exactly
where to find

601
00:29:28,897 --> 00:29:31,098
those Dave Grohl-wannabe
bitches.

602
00:29:35,971 --> 00:29:37,137
Gotcha.

603
00:29:37,172 --> 00:29:39,172
The Fu Fighters' encampment.

604
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:41,241
Okay, guys, here you go.

605
00:29:41,276 --> 00:29:44,911
Aw, it's a shame, isn't it, El?

606
00:29:44,947 --> 00:29:47,481
Utter shame.

607
00:29:47,516 --> 00:29:48,715
I mean, I can't be the one

608
00:29:48,751 --> 00:29:50,951
to sneak into
the Fu Fighters' base.

609
00:29:50,986 --> 00:29:52,519
Certainly not.
You don't sneak.

610
00:29:52,554 --> 00:29:53,887
Mm-mm.

611
00:29:53,922 --> 00:29:55,822
And you can't be the one
to dump that potion

612
00:29:55,858 --> 00:29:59,526
into whatever disgusting stew
they're cooking for dinner.

613
00:29:59,561 --> 00:30:00,794
Sadly, no.

614
00:30:00,829 --> 00:30:03,063
My eminence is too easy
to spot from afar.

615
00:30:03,098 --> 00:30:04,698
Hmm.

616
00:30:04,733 --> 00:30:07,701
If only we had someone
they'd never seen--

617
00:30:07,736 --> 00:30:11,271
Guys, stop the bit.
I'll go.

618
00:30:11,306 --> 00:30:16,243
Eternal glory awaits you,
O Joshua of Yonkers.

619
00:30:16,278 --> 00:30:19,946
Eternal glory.

620
00:30:19,982 --> 00:30:21,181
You done?

621
00:30:21,216 --> 00:30:23,016
I'm done.

622
00:30:23,051 --> 00:30:24,251
Great.

623
00:30:30,058 --> 00:30:32,159
Here's your overdue book.

624
00:30:32,194 --> 00:30:35,162
Now can you find me some shit
to help with my hands, please?

625
00:30:35,197 --> 00:30:37,798
I will look for some<i> thing</i>

626
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:39,800
to help you with that
in just a moment.

627
00:30:56,218 --> 00:30:58,051
Are you okay?

628
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,726
Uh, hello?

629
00:31:11,733 --> 00:31:13,266
Uh, I asked you a question, man.

630
00:31:13,302 --> 00:31:15,035
- Are you okay?
- No!

631
00:31:16,672 --> 00:31:18,605
I can't control my...

632
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,840
look out!

633
00:31:25,614 --> 00:31:27,147
No!

634
00:31:29,251 --> 00:31:32,448
I can't... stop!

635
00:31:52,214 --> 00:31:54,916
The card was cursed.
A Modus Hex.

636
00:31:54,951 --> 00:31:56,984
It forces you to perform
an action against your will.

637
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,586
Yeah, but that dude
killed himself.

638
00:31:58,621 --> 00:32:00,154
Okay? The hex didn't
make him do that.

639
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,723
His name was Howard.

640
00:32:01,758 --> 00:32:03,925
And if it wasn't
for his bravery,

641
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,526
the hex would have forced him
to do something

642
00:32:05,562 --> 00:32:07,028
incredibly dangerous.

643
00:32:07,063 --> 00:32:08,629
Open a door?

644
00:32:08,665 --> 00:32:10,098
It isn't just any door.

645
00:32:10,133 --> 00:32:12,066
Then what is it?

646
00:32:12,102 --> 00:32:14,035
As a novice of The Order,
there are many secrets

647
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,770
that will be imparted to you
when the time is right.

648
00:32:15,805 --> 00:32:16,971
I just watched a man
kill himself!

649
00:32:17,006 --> 00:32:18,206
What's behind the door?

650
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,710
The Poison Room.

651
00:32:22,746 --> 00:32:24,545
The what?

652
00:32:24,581 --> 00:32:26,647
It's where we store books
too dangerous for the public.

653
00:32:26,683 --> 00:32:29,550
I suspect Harriet's curse was an
attempt to steal its contents.

654
00:32:29,586 --> 00:32:31,185
Wait, Howard kamikazed himself

655
00:32:31,221 --> 00:32:33,554
'cause someone wanted
some banned books?

656
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,757
That's pretty fucked up!

657
00:32:35,792 --> 00:32:37,425
What is...

658
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:40,128
fucked up is that there
is knowledge out there

659
00:32:40,163 --> 00:32:41,696
so dangerous we need
a Poison Room

660
00:32:41,731 --> 00:32:43,164
so it doesn't fall
into the wrong hands.

661
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:46,701
That is why Howard
sacrificed his life.

662
00:32:46,736 --> 00:32:48,636
It's something all
Librarians would do.

663
00:32:48,671 --> 00:32:50,571
So he had to die to keep
someone from getting

664
00:32:50,607 --> 00:32:52,573
their hands on what?

665
00:32:52,609 --> 00:32:54,475
Some crazy battle magic?

666
00:32:54,511 --> 00:32:56,210
There is knowledge
behind that door, Penny,

667
00:32:56,246 --> 00:32:59,614
that could destroy more
than just people.

668
00:32:59,649 --> 00:33:02,917
It could destroy worlds.

669
00:33:02,952 --> 00:33:05,553
The Tesla Flexion has only
been successfully employed

670
00:33:05,588 --> 00:33:06,988
once before.

671
00:33:07,023 --> 00:33:09,791
Luckily, we're using
the original equipment,

672
00:33:09,826 --> 00:33:12,093
left to Brakebills by
the man who invented it.

673
00:33:12,128 --> 00:33:13,528
Nikola Tesla?

674
00:33:13,563 --> 00:33:15,630
No, Fred Flexion.

675
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,233
Okay.

676
00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:21,803
And it's only been used
once before because--

677
00:33:21,838 --> 00:33:24,739
Three people died trying
to shut it down last time.

678
00:33:24,774 --> 00:33:26,507
What's the tent for?

679
00:33:26,543 --> 00:33:29,710
The Flexion is a fold between
two different realities.

680
00:33:29,746 --> 00:33:32,046
The tented area is where
they cross over.

681
00:33:32,081 --> 00:33:34,215
Now, Ms. Wicker and I
will work together

682
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,650
to cast the Flexion,

683
00:33:35,685 --> 00:33:37,819
but if we hold it longer
than two minutes,

684
00:33:37,854 --> 00:33:40,121
we will all die.

685
00:33:40,156 --> 00:33:42,156
Well, don't sugarcoat it.

686
00:33:42,192 --> 00:33:43,858
Quentin...

687
00:33:46,529 --> 00:33:47,995
Get the answers that you need,

688
00:33:48,031 --> 00:33:50,164
and then get out.

689
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,533
Understood?

690
00:33:52,569 --> 00:33:56,037
And try not to touch
anything in there.

691
00:33:56,072 --> 00:33:58,239
Okay. Why?

692
00:33:58,274 --> 00:33:59,640
Matter from different realities

693
00:33:59,676 --> 00:34:01,075
occupying the same space

694
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,276
can create a paradox.

695
00:34:02,312 --> 00:34:05,079
More like an explosion.

696
00:34:05,114 --> 00:34:07,281
As well a mess of problems
for the people who'd find

697
00:34:07,317 --> 00:34:10,017
what's left of our bodies.

698
00:34:10,053 --> 00:34:11,652
Touch nothing.

699
00:34:11,688 --> 00:34:13,154
Got it.

700
00:34:15,091 --> 00:34:17,158
Dude, their shit was
seriously jacked up.

701
00:34:17,193 --> 00:34:19,694
Their K-holes were
inside K-holes.

702
00:34:19,729 --> 00:34:21,629
Does that even make sense?

703
00:34:21,664 --> 00:34:23,164
I'm just saying, the Fu Fighters

704
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:26,200
are out of "comish"
for the foreseeable future.

705
00:34:26,236 --> 00:34:28,102
Your wedding may
proceed apace, sire.

706
00:34:28,137 --> 00:34:32,740
And you, good sir, may shave
any nymph in the kingdom.

707
00:34:32,775 --> 00:34:35,843
- Like right now?
- Like right now.

708
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:38,846
You are my once and future king.

709
00:34:43,186 --> 00:34:44,986
Just floating this:

710
00:34:45,021 --> 00:34:48,189
would it be weird
if I fucked Josh?

711
00:34:48,224 --> 00:34:50,791
I certainly hope
it would be weird.

712
00:34:53,229 --> 00:34:55,930
To my quick-thinking Bambi,

713
00:34:55,965 --> 00:34:57,932
who saved the day again.

714
00:35:00,937 --> 00:35:02,303
Speaking of saving the day,

715
00:35:02,338 --> 00:35:05,740
did you ever manage
to talk to Fen?

716
00:35:05,775 --> 00:35:08,609
Um, yeah.

717
00:35:08,645 --> 00:35:09,810
She's fine.

718
00:35:09,846 --> 00:35:10,945
Good.

719
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,179
That's a relief.

720
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:17,351
Fen? Fen!

721
00:35:24,227 --> 00:35:26,928
I want to talk to you about
the terms of our deal.

722
00:35:34,103 --> 00:35:36,037
Oh, shit.

723
00:35:36,072 --> 00:35:38,105
- Shit, shit--
- You saw it?

724
00:35:38,141 --> 00:35:40,141
You saw it too.

725
00:35:40,176 --> 00:35:41,142
Fen!

726
00:35:41,177 --> 00:35:43,110
I'm not going mad.

727
00:35:43,146 --> 00:35:46,380
Well...

728
00:35:46,416 --> 00:35:48,649
no.

729
00:35:48,685 --> 00:35:50,318
You're not.

730
00:35:50,353 --> 00:35:53,154
It was a fairy, okay?

731
00:35:53,189 --> 00:35:55,256
Look, the day
The Wellspring failed,

732
00:35:55,291 --> 00:35:57,391
I made a deal to save
Eliot's life.

733
00:35:57,427 --> 00:35:58,893
You did, too.

734
00:35:58,928 --> 00:36:00,728
I don't understand.

735
00:36:00,763 --> 00:36:02,964
You agreed to do whatever
it took to save him.

736
00:36:02,999 --> 00:36:04,131
But I didn't.

737
00:36:04,167 --> 00:36:06,734
Well, you did.

738
00:36:06,769 --> 00:36:08,002
What do they want?

739
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,405
Your baby.

740
00:36:11,441 --> 00:36:13,307
- What?
- Fen...

741
00:36:13,343 --> 00:36:15,176
I can stop this.

742
00:36:15,211 --> 00:36:17,311
You better fix this, because I
will not let them

743
00:36:17,347 --> 00:36:18,913
take my child.

744
00:36:22,986 --> 00:36:25,653
Fuck.

745
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,868
Quentin?

746
00:37:13,903 --> 00:37:14,935
Is that you?

747
00:37:14,971 --> 00:37:16,203
You're in a Tesla Flexion.

748
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:18,272
I'm from another timeline.

749
00:37:18,307 --> 00:37:19,840
We only have two minutes.

750
00:37:19,876 --> 00:37:21,876
I need you to tell me
everything you know

751
00:37:21,911 --> 00:37:23,344
about Shades.

752
00:37:23,379 --> 00:37:25,112
It is you.

753
00:37:25,148 --> 00:37:26,881
Another you--you're alive.

754
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:29,884
No, stop.
We can't touch.

755
00:37:29,919 --> 00:37:31,252
I'm sorry.
We have to go fast.

756
00:37:31,287 --> 00:37:33,087
I understand.

757
00:37:33,122 --> 00:37:34,989
Um...

758
00:37:35,024 --> 00:37:36,123
I'll tell you everything I know.

759
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:38,025
It's just...

760
00:37:38,061 --> 00:37:39,927
I thought I'd never
see you again.

761
00:37:39,962 --> 00:37:42,930
The Beast, he--
he tore you apart

762
00:37:42,965 --> 00:37:44,965
piece by piece,
but not just your body,

763
00:37:45,001 --> 00:37:46,901
but your--your Shade,
everything.

764
00:37:46,936 --> 00:37:48,502
My Shade.
Do you know where it went?

765
00:37:48,538 --> 00:37:51,472
I searched everywhere for it.

766
00:37:51,507 --> 00:37:53,774
You can't rest in peace
without it.

767
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:56,811
But there are no books
on how to do...

768
00:37:56,846 --> 00:37:59,146
so I traveled the world in
search of anyone, anything,

769
00:37:59,182 --> 00:38:00,347
that could help me.

770
00:38:00,383 --> 00:38:02,850
What did you learn?

771
00:38:02,885 --> 00:38:05,920
Shades go to The Underworld.

772
00:38:05,955 --> 00:38:07,121
There's an Underworld?

773
00:38:07,156 --> 00:38:08,989
It's only accessible
to the dead.

774
00:38:09,025 --> 00:38:10,925
But there's a catch.

775
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,160
Alice, what happened
to your hand?

776
00:38:13,196 --> 00:38:14,995
Doesn't matter.

777
00:38:15,031 --> 00:38:18,332
It's the least I gave up
to learn this.

778
00:38:21,904 --> 00:38:23,838
The living can access
The Underworld

779
00:38:23,873 --> 00:38:25,073
with the help of a Gatekeeper.

780
00:38:25,108 --> 00:38:27,041
- A Gatekeeper?
- An ancient one.

781
00:38:27,076 --> 00:38:29,310
A being older than
the world itself.

782
00:38:29,345 --> 00:38:32,146
Okay, how do you find
one of those?

783
00:38:32,181 --> 00:38:34,315
I don't know.

784
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:37,451
I'm still looking.

785
00:38:42,291 --> 00:38:44,225
- I have to go.
- Please, please--

786
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:45,559
just one more thing.

787
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,496
We can't hold it
much longer, Quentin!

788
00:38:48,531 --> 00:38:51,432
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

789
00:38:51,467 --> 00:38:53,467
Sorry for what?

790
00:38:55,204 --> 00:38:57,938
When you died,

791
00:38:57,974 --> 00:38:59,874
we weren't in a good place.

792
00:39:01,477 --> 00:39:04,245
We were--we were fighting,

793
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:08,415
and I was too proud to--
to let it go.

794
00:39:12,088 --> 00:39:13,854
I don't know what that
other Quentin felt,

795
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:17,057
but in this world, I love you.

796
00:39:17,093 --> 00:39:18,826
Okay.

797
00:39:18,861 --> 00:39:21,362
No matter what.

798
00:39:21,397 --> 00:39:23,130
I love you.

799
00:39:46,544 --> 00:39:49,202
Yeah, but Harriet didn't know
the guy was gonna kill himself.

800
00:39:49,322 --> 00:39:50,547
Are you defending her?

801
00:39:50,583 --> 00:39:54,090
No, I'm just saying that
she's not totally wrong.

802
00:39:55,194 --> 00:39:56,794
The Librarians are
hiding something.

803
00:39:56,829 --> 00:39:58,762
Yeah, things that are
insanely dangerous.

804
00:39:58,798 --> 00:40:00,364
They could have good reasons.

805
00:40:00,399 --> 00:40:01,565
Okay, and who the fuck
are librarians to decide

806
00:40:01,601 --> 00:40:03,300
who gets what?

807
00:40:03,336 --> 00:40:05,169
Do you really want every
Hedge Witch with a grudge

808
00:40:05,204 --> 00:40:07,671
and a bad idea to get
a nuclear bomb?

809
00:40:07,707 --> 00:40:09,707
Fuck you.

810
00:40:09,742 --> 00:40:11,675
I'm not talking about you.

811
00:40:11,711 --> 00:40:14,712
Yeah, you are.

812
00:40:14,747 --> 00:40:18,148
No, I'm not.

813
00:40:18,184 --> 00:40:19,550
Think we might be too late.

814
00:40:19,585 --> 00:40:22,186
Motherfucker.

815
00:40:24,957 --> 00:40:26,657
No.

816
00:40:26,692 --> 00:40:28,325
No, no...

817
00:40:45,411 --> 00:40:48,579
"The Ars Deicidium"?

818
00:40:48,614 --> 00:40:50,214
"The Art of Killing Gods."

819
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:56,420
Eliot?
Oh, thank God.

820
00:40:56,455 --> 00:40:58,255
I don't know what to do.

821
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,957
Margo made a deal with
the fairies and they're

822
00:40:59,992 --> 00:41:02,292
coming for our baby.

823
00:41:04,964 --> 00:41:06,930
A deal is a deal.

824
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,607
You've been staring
at that page for an hour.

825
00:41:17,977 --> 00:41:19,610
Oh.

826
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:24,348
I just keep seeing her face.

827
00:41:29,955 --> 00:41:31,755
I get that you're hurting.

828
00:41:34,894 --> 00:41:37,261
I don't know what to say
to make you feel better.

829
00:41:37,296 --> 00:41:39,563
It's okay.

830
00:41:39,598 --> 00:41:41,899
I don't really want
to feel better anyway.

831
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:58,949
Maybe I better not
show you this then.

832
00:41:58,984 --> 00:42:01,452
I think I figured out
what an Ancient One is.

833
00:42:08,494 --> 00:42:10,694
No fucking way.

834
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:21,208
