1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,514
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:02,634 --> 00:00:05,028
This contract initiates our
services in exchange for...

3
00:00:05,148 --> 00:00:07,150
Unlimited manual and magical labor?

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:09,136
You signed that insane contract?

5
00:00:09,171 --> 00:00:11,591
- Yeah, it's okay.
- How the hell is that okay?

6
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:12,921
Because I get magic back.

7
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:14,419
Did you do this for me?

8
00:00:14,454 --> 00:00:17,655
I'm Bayler, a proud soldier
of Fillorians United.

9
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:19,357
We will not rest until

10
00:00:19,392 --> 00:00:21,359
a Fillorian sits upon the throne.

11
00:00:21,394 --> 00:00:23,428
The fairies can bring back
The Wellspring?

12
00:00:23,463 --> 00:00:25,496
- They can.
- And in return?

13
00:00:25,532 --> 00:00:27,331
A royal child of Whitespire.

14
00:00:27,367 --> 00:00:28,733
We're getting married.

15
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:31,402
Apparently all monarchs are
entitled to one of each:

16
00:00:31,438 --> 00:00:32,831
a wife and a husband.

17
00:00:32,951 --> 00:00:35,239
Alice, I hope you meant it.

18
00:00:35,275 --> 00:00:39,110
I hope you just go
and do beautiful magic.

19
00:00:39,145 --> 00:00:40,545
Quentin says go free.

20
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,214
You fed him to Reynard.

21
00:00:43,249 --> 00:00:44,415
He knew how to survive.

22
00:00:44,451 --> 00:00:46,584
Yeah, by doing what you want.

23
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:49,353
That's all you see anymore,
is what you want.

24
00:00:49,389 --> 00:00:51,622
You don't feel anymore, Julia...

25
00:00:51,658 --> 00:00:53,391
not the way a human does.

26
00:00:53,426 --> 00:00:54,592
Do you remember the gift

27
00:00:54,627 --> 00:00:56,194
that Jane was given in the book

28
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:57,762
"The Girl Who Told Time"?

29
00:00:57,797 --> 00:00:59,897
Ember gave her the ability
to fuck with time

30
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:01,432
on a cosmic scale.

31
00:01:01,468 --> 00:01:03,701
Jane used it to create a time loop.

32
00:01:03,736 --> 00:01:07,305
In each loop, Jane alters something

33
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,706
to see if it'll change the outcome.

34
00:01:08,741 --> 00:01:09,807
What's different this time?

35
00:01:09,843 --> 00:01:10,843
I was at Brakebills.

36
00:01:10,877 --> 00:01:11,917
You were supposed to be.

37
00:01:11,945 --> 00:01:14,445
Or you were, like, 39 times.

38
00:01:14,481 --> 00:01:15,847
You were the thing they changed.

39
00:01:23,389 --> 00:01:26,190
Very impressive, Ms. Wicker.

40
00:01:26,226 --> 00:01:27,425
Let me do it again.

41
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,760
I was wondering what would happen

42
00:01:29,796 --> 00:01:33,731
if I connected the sequence with
Atsuko's Spectral Refraction.

43
00:01:33,766 --> 00:01:34,832
All right.

44
00:01:51,751 --> 00:01:54,418
That is a second year spell.

45
00:01:54,454 --> 00:01:55,753
I...I read ahead.

46
00:01:55,788 --> 00:01:57,922
More than that, you...

47
00:01:57,957 --> 00:02:00,758
you understood the theory
behind the spell, and...

48
00:02:00,793 --> 00:02:03,394
and you reshaped it.

49
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:06,197
Your discipline is meta-composition.

50
00:02:06,232 --> 00:02:08,533
You are a Knowledge student.

51
00:02:08,568 --> 00:02:10,935
- Knowledge?
- Part psychic, part physical.

52
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,571
There really is no branch
it doesn't touch on.

53
00:02:13,606 --> 00:02:15,907
The short version: you are drawn,

54
00:02:15,942 --> 00:02:19,477
mind and body,
to the discovery of magic.

55
00:02:19,512 --> 00:02:22,246
Is it true that they...
um, well that we...

56
00:02:22,282 --> 00:02:24,348
live in the attic above the Library?

57
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:27,818
I assure you it is much more
luxurious than it sounds.

58
00:02:27,854 --> 00:02:29,787
No, I mean, it sounds
like bliss, actually.

59
00:02:29,822 --> 00:02:32,490
I enjoyed it.

60
00:02:32,525 --> 00:02:33,691
You were a Knowledge student?

61
00:02:33,726 --> 00:02:35,259
I am a Knowledge student.

62
00:02:35,295 --> 00:02:37,528
It doesn't end with your degree.

63
00:02:37,564 --> 00:02:39,297
You have a rare gift, Julia,

64
00:02:39,332 --> 00:02:43,534
and I must admit I'm envious
of the many rich discoveries

65
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,403
that you have ahead of you.

66
00:02:45,438 --> 00:02:46,704
Welcome.

67
00:02:48,341 --> 00:02:49,807
Thank you.

68
00:03:06,593 --> 00:03:08,893
You are free to go.

69
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,494
Why would you let me go?

70
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,830
Because, Ms. Wicker,

71
00:03:12,865 --> 00:03:14,599
you are not a student here,

72
00:03:14,634 --> 00:03:16,867
and I'm not running a jail.

73
00:03:16,903 --> 00:03:20,371
Kady locked me up for a good reason.

74
00:03:20,406 --> 00:03:22,573
I should feel terrible

75
00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:24,008
about what I did.

76
00:03:26,312 --> 00:03:28,879
But I don't.

77
00:03:28,915 --> 00:03:31,749
I just think it's terrible,

78
00:03:31,784 --> 00:03:35,419
and I think I would've never
done it if I were me.

79
00:03:35,455 --> 00:03:37,888
One thing I've learned
about you, Ms. Wicker,

80
00:03:37,924 --> 00:03:40,491
is that you are a searcher.

81
00:03:43,363 --> 00:03:45,029
You don't know me.

82
00:03:45,064 --> 00:03:48,599
39 times I've known you.

83
00:03:48,635 --> 00:03:51,469
Which is why I trust that
you'll put aside your fear

84
00:03:51,504 --> 00:03:53,471
and self-pity

85
00:03:53,506 --> 00:03:56,540
and look for the answers
that can save you.

86
00:04:01,414 --> 00:04:03,581
Why am I the only one
worried about this wedding?

87
00:04:07,787 --> 00:04:10,388
Congratulations. You failed.

88
00:04:10,423 --> 00:04:13,057
Oh, hey, hey, um,

89
00:04:13,092 --> 00:04:14,592
King needs more wine.

90
00:04:14,627 --> 00:04:16,494
Of course, sire.

91
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:18,062
I feel bad; I forgot your name.

92
00:04:18,097 --> 00:04:20,064
It's Smedley, sire.

93
00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:21,932
Smedley. Thanks, Smedley.

94
00:04:21,968 --> 00:04:24,635
Hey. I'll take that.

95
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:26,904
Oh, no, wait, I'm... I'm not done.

96
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:29,707
I think you were.

97
00:04:29,742 --> 00:04:30,975
Not cool.

98
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,577
Those grapes died for nothing now.

99
00:04:33,613 --> 00:04:35,980
Those grapes died so you might live.

100
00:04:36,015 --> 00:04:37,615
Because if you keep drinking,

101
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,917
I will seriously cut a bitch.

102
00:04:39,952 --> 00:04:41,819
You never yell at Eliot for being drunk.

103
00:04:41,854 --> 00:04:43,521
Because Eliot's fun.

104
00:04:43,556 --> 00:04:46,324
You're depressing.
It's been three months.

105
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:49,493
Technically, it's only been
a couple of days on Earth, so...

106
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:51,429
Three months on Fillory

107
00:04:51,464 --> 00:04:53,864
of emo Quentin.

108
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,766
Not my favorite Quentin.

109
00:04:55,802 --> 00:04:58,803
I didn't know that you liked
any of the Quentins.

110
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:02,606
I had to let Alice go.

111
00:05:02,642 --> 00:05:05,109
I'm...

112
00:05:05,144 --> 00:05:06,677
sympathetic.

113
00:05:06,713 --> 00:05:07,878
Okay?

114
00:05:07,914 --> 00:05:09,580
But meanwhile,

115
00:05:09,615 --> 00:05:12,683
Groomzilla is suddenly my full-time job.

116
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:13,984
I need your help.

117
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,721
Bambi! This is an emergency.

118
00:05:16,756 --> 00:05:18,456
These are all wrong.

119
00:05:18,491 --> 00:05:20,825
You're banished forever. Thank you.

120
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,894
He's just so mean when he needs things.

121
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,564
Eliot needs a friend, asshole.

122
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:28,566
It's your turn to be button boy

123
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:30,868
and run his random Earth errands.

124
00:05:30,903 --> 00:05:32,937
I need a free moment

125
00:05:32,972 --> 00:05:35,606
to rub one out in a hot bath

126
00:05:35,641 --> 00:05:38,476
before I fucking kill someone.

127
00:05:38,511 --> 00:05:40,878
That someone being you.

128
00:05:42,148 --> 00:05:43,647
Message received.

129
00:05:43,683 --> 00:05:47,051
And get your feet off my throne.

130
00:05:51,457 --> 00:05:53,057
This is insane. Why the fuck would Fogg

131
00:05:53,092 --> 00:05:54,092
let Julia go?

132
00:05:54,127 --> 00:05:55,126
Haven't you ever noticed?

133
00:05:55,161 --> 00:05:56,827
Fogg isn't that helpful.

134
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,896
Plus, you knew he couldn't
keep her in there forever.

135
00:05:58,931 --> 00:06:00,998
Yeah, well, I thought
she'd at least be in there

136
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:03,567
long enough for us to figure out
what to do next.

137
00:06:03,603 --> 00:06:04,935
Where are you going?

138
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:08,205
I still have Reynard to deal with.

139
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:10,441
And I really don't want
to run into Julia.

140
00:06:10,476 --> 00:06:11,675
Fine, let's go.

141
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,977
Okay, no.

142
00:06:13,012 --> 00:06:15,880
Penny, Reynard is my problem.

143
00:06:15,915 --> 00:06:17,181
We've been over this.

144
00:06:17,216 --> 00:06:19,984
Rapist monsters are a universal problem.

145
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:21,719
And the last time you tried to help,

146
00:06:21,754 --> 00:06:25,122
you signed, like, a billion-year
contract with The Order.

147
00:06:26,726 --> 00:06:28,025
When does that start, by the way?

148
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,794
Not today.

149
00:06:29,829 --> 00:06:32,129
Takes 'em four weeks to process
a book request.

150
00:06:32,165 --> 00:06:33,798
Let's go.

151
00:06:42,742 --> 00:06:44,975
Uh...

152
00:06:45,011 --> 00:06:47,678
where are we?

153
00:06:47,713 --> 00:06:50,014
Penny, we've processed your application

154
00:06:50,049 --> 00:06:53,320
and would like to formally
welcome you to The Order.

155
00:06:54,754 --> 00:06:56,734
Shit.

156
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,420
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<b>WEB-DL resync by kinglouisxx</b>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</fo

157
00:07:06,966 --> 00:07:09,767
Congratulations!

158
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,975
Kady, we've allowed you here
to assist in Penny's transition.

159
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,810
But I'm afraid I'm not allowed
to discuss the business

160
00:07:19,845 --> 00:07:21,145
of The Order with you present.

161
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,147
Yeah, fine. I'll fuck off.

162
00:07:23,182 --> 00:07:25,182
Uh, no eating or drinking in the Library

163
00:07:25,217 --> 00:07:26,417
except where posted.

164
00:07:27,954 --> 00:07:29,987
Now, Penny,

165
00:07:30,022 --> 00:07:33,290
we need to go over some
of your... obligations.

166
00:07:36,028 --> 00:07:37,261
I just don't get it.

167
00:07:37,296 --> 00:07:39,229
I mean, I did head off a famine...

168
00:07:39,265 --> 00:07:41,332
personally staved off a war.

169
00:07:41,367 --> 00:07:43,167
Not to mention, The Wellspring
is back online.

170
00:07:43,202 --> 00:07:45,803
And yet the people don't like me
any more than they did.

171
00:07:45,838 --> 00:07:48,205
How can you possibly know
what they actually think of you?

172
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,108
There's this Earth magician,
Nate Silver.

173
00:07:51,143 --> 00:07:54,111
I adapted one of his polling spells.

174
00:07:54,146 --> 00:07:57,414
Right now, my approval rating is at 26%,

175
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,383
which is not good, Bayler.

176
00:07:59,418 --> 00:08:00,784
Not at all.

177
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,420
But still, why ask me?

178
00:08:03,456 --> 00:08:06,123
Mmm, I don't know.

179
00:08:06,158 --> 00:08:08,425
I figured you might know
why they hate me so much,

180
00:08:08,461 --> 00:08:10,427
seeing as you tried to murder me.

181
00:08:10,463 --> 00:08:13,130
Okay, that was before I got to know you.

182
00:08:13,165 --> 00:08:17,067
And before you introduced me
to this Earth delicacy...

183
00:08:17,103 --> 00:08:18,435
na-chos.

184
00:08:18,471 --> 00:08:21,905
Wait till you try your first margarita.

185
00:08:21,941 --> 00:08:24,041
Mmm.

186
00:08:24,076 --> 00:08:25,943
Listen...

187
00:08:25,978 --> 00:08:28,779
If you're really worried about
what the people think of you,

188
00:08:28,814 --> 00:08:30,014
let's talk about your wedding.

189
00:08:30,049 --> 00:08:32,182
Ugh. Can we not?

190
00:08:32,218 --> 00:08:33,717
Historically,

191
00:08:33,753 --> 00:08:36,754
a royal wedding is the perfect
time for a monarch

192
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:38,222
to make their appeal to the people.

193
00:08:38,257 --> 00:08:40,190
Idri prefers a private ceremony.

194
00:08:40,226 --> 00:08:42,159
But what if you went public?

195
00:08:42,194 --> 00:08:44,294
Might improve your polling.

196
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:50,200
One for $20, three for $50.

197
00:08:50,236 --> 00:08:53,170
Which gets you the highest?

198
00:08:53,205 --> 00:08:55,039
Highest?

199
00:08:55,074 --> 00:08:58,075
This is grown locally
from heirloom seed stock,

200
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:01,045
paired with the ideal pastry
for a curated drug experience.

201
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,413
This will make you levitate.

202
00:09:02,448 --> 00:09:04,848
This is like being hugged by a rainbow.

203
00:09:04,884 --> 00:09:07,151
This is like being blown by a rainbow.

204
00:09:07,186 --> 00:09:08,385
Do not mix these up.

205
00:09:08,421 --> 00:09:09,820
Yeah, I'll take six.

206
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:15,893
So the High King needs me?

207
00:09:15,928 --> 00:09:18,996
Yes, he asked for you specifically.

208
00:09:19,031 --> 00:09:20,764
A command performance.

209
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,367
Righteous.

210
00:09:23,402 --> 00:09:24,935
How are... how are you doing?

211
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,271
The last time I saw you, you weren't...

212
00:09:27,306 --> 00:09:29,206
doing so good.

213
00:09:29,241 --> 00:09:31,041
Whatever happened with the whole, uh...

214
00:09:31,077 --> 00:09:32,242
I let her go.

215
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:34,144
I'm fine.

216
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,979
I've been self-medicating, so...

217
00:09:36,015 --> 00:09:37,948
uh, they don't have Abilify in Fillory,

218
00:09:37,983 --> 00:09:40,317
but I have been improvising.

219
00:09:40,352 --> 00:09:44,321
Well, this is Dr. Josh's prescription.

220
00:09:44,356 --> 00:09:46,957
I mean, we don't have
to race off to Fillory

221
00:09:46,992 --> 00:09:49,326
right this second.

222
00:09:49,361 --> 00:09:50,994
We have a minute. What's it do?

223
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:54,031
Dude, lets you see into other worlds.

224
00:09:54,066 --> 00:09:55,265
It's rad.

225
00:10:03,843 --> 00:10:05,275
This is rad.

226
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,825
Is that you...

227
00:10:21,861 --> 00:10:24,461
Quentin?

228
00:10:24,497 --> 00:10:26,930
Um...

229
00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:29,867
you look familiar.

230
00:10:29,902 --> 00:10:33,003
Holy shit, Julia?

231
00:10:33,038 --> 00:10:35,038
Why do you look like a 12-year-old?

232
00:10:35,074 --> 00:10:37,007
Because I'm her Shade.

233
00:10:39,478 --> 00:10:42,546
Oh, Q, I'm so happy to see you again.

234
00:10:42,581 --> 00:10:44,381
I really, really missed you.

235
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:45,883
Her Shade?

236
00:10:45,918 --> 00:10:48,051
I thought that you were gone.

237
00:10:48,087 --> 00:10:49,386
I'm lost.

238
00:10:49,421 --> 00:10:51,321
I can't find my way home.

239
00:10:53,025 --> 00:10:54,825
This is getting less rad.

240
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,293
Please, Quentin.

241
00:10:56,328 --> 00:10:58,295
I've been looking for a way out,
and then...

242
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:01,098
suddenly I could see you.

243
00:11:01,133 --> 00:11:03,200
Yeah, you're in another world.

244
00:11:03,235 --> 00:11:04,700
Um...

245
00:11:04,821 --> 00:11:05,987
where are you?

246
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:07,747
I have no idea.

247
00:11:09,108 --> 00:11:10,374
I can't stay here.

248
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:11,608
Time is running out.

249
00:11:11,644 --> 00:11:13,577
- Can you help me?
- Yeah, I'll try.

250
00:11:13,612 --> 00:11:15,790
- H-how can I find you?
- I don't know.

251
00:11:15,815 --> 00:11:17,614
I don't even know how I got here.

252
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,283
Please, Quentin.

253
00:11:19,318 --> 00:11:21,418
I have to get back to Julia.

254
00:11:21,453 --> 00:11:23,620
You have to find me
before it's too late.

255
00:11:44,072 --> 00:11:45,519
Holy shit, are we at war?

256
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,074
I wish we were at war.

257
00:11:47,109 --> 00:11:49,143
These are the place settings
for the wedding.

258
00:11:49,178 --> 00:11:50,911
Much more dangerous.

259
00:11:50,947 --> 00:11:52,713
How's Josh doing in the royal kitchens?

260
00:11:52,748 --> 00:11:54,582
Uh...

261
00:11:54,617 --> 00:11:57,818
he's declared them "adequate."

262
00:11:57,853 --> 00:11:59,587
Eliot, I have to go back to Earth.

263
00:11:59,622 --> 00:12:00,821
Don't be ridiculous.

264
00:12:00,856 --> 00:12:02,790
You have far too much to do here.

265
00:12:02,825 --> 00:12:04,425
I had a vision, okay?

266
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:08,162
A way that I can maybe help Julia.

267
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,799
I can't ignore it.

268
00:12:11,834 --> 00:12:13,167
Can't you?

269
00:12:13,202 --> 00:12:16,103
It was a motherfucking vision, El.

270
00:12:16,138 --> 00:12:17,705
Look, I don't know how else to say it.

271
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,139
I just... I feel like this
is something that I...

272
00:12:19,175 --> 00:12:20,874
I have to do right now.

273
00:12:23,846 --> 00:12:25,045
I can see that.

274
00:12:27,183 --> 00:12:29,683
Yeah.

275
00:12:29,719 --> 00:12:33,587
If you miss my wedding, I will kill you.

276
00:12:33,623 --> 00:12:35,689
- Okay.
- Okay.

277
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,495
Hey, uh, can you help me
find some information?

278
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,730
Of course.

279
00:12:42,765 --> 00:12:43,998
What are you looking for?

280
00:12:44,033 --> 00:12:45,532
Well, say you have a...

281
00:12:45,568 --> 00:12:48,168
a being with an enormous
amount of power.

282
00:12:48,204 --> 00:12:51,238
I'm looking for how someone might...

283
00:12:51,273 --> 00:12:53,007
you know, defeat them.

284
00:12:53,042 --> 00:12:54,708
How much power?

285
00:12:54,744 --> 00:12:57,144
Let's say... god-like?

286
00:12:57,179 --> 00:12:58,812
So classical myths?

287
00:12:58,848 --> 00:13:02,483
No, more like a how-to manual.

288
00:13:02,518 --> 00:13:03,851
Let me check upstairs.

289
00:13:19,235 --> 00:13:20,734
So do we just wait?

290
00:13:27,743 --> 00:13:28,942
Oh.

291
00:13:36,185 --> 00:13:37,518
I'm afraid we don't have
any books available

292
00:13:37,553 --> 00:13:39,119
on that particular topic.

293
00:13:39,155 --> 00:13:43,290
There's nothing in the entire
Library of the Neitherlands

294
00:13:43,325 --> 00:13:45,159
on killing any kind of god?

295
00:13:45,194 --> 00:13:46,994
Have you considered that it
might not be strictly possible

296
00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:48,829
to do so?

297
00:13:48,864 --> 00:13:51,665
Didn't the Norse Gods kill
each other, like, all the time?

298
00:13:51,701 --> 00:13:53,567
The Library is full of stories.

299
00:13:53,602 --> 00:13:54,868
It happened.

300
00:13:54,904 --> 00:13:56,070
I know it has.

301
00:13:56,105 --> 00:13:58,205
In Fillory, The Beast killed Umber.

302
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,107
Sounds fascinating.

303
00:14:00,142 --> 00:14:01,975
Unfortunately, there is no
written record

304
00:14:02,011 --> 00:14:05,179
of the type you seek regarding
the mechanics of such an event.

305
00:14:05,214 --> 00:14:06,714
Terribly sorry.

306
00:14:16,859 --> 00:14:20,127
Struck out looking
for a god-murder spell.

307
00:14:20,162 --> 00:14:22,796
It can't be that no one
in all of history ever...

308
00:14:22,832 --> 00:14:25,032
Well, apparently,
no one ever wrote it down.

309
00:14:26,802 --> 00:14:28,001
Look, if a way exists,

310
00:14:28,037 --> 00:14:29,236
I'm finding it.

311
00:14:29,271 --> 00:14:30,938
So what's up with your hands?

312
00:14:30,973 --> 00:14:33,240
They told me there are books to help me,

313
00:14:33,275 --> 00:14:37,111
but I'd have to do the research
on my own time.

314
00:14:37,146 --> 00:14:39,847
Seriously? What are you
supposed to do in the meantime?

315
00:14:39,882 --> 00:14:42,683
My job.

316
00:14:42,718 --> 00:14:44,885
Apparently, I track down overdue books,

317
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,822
and this one has been checked
out for over ten years.

318
00:14:48,858 --> 00:14:50,090
You got to be kidding.

319
00:14:50,126 --> 00:14:52,893
Since I still can't cast,

320
00:14:52,928 --> 00:14:55,329
I thought you could help me out
with a little locator spell?

321
00:15:08,677 --> 00:15:09,743
My King.

322
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:10,978
Hi, Fen.

323
00:15:12,848 --> 00:15:14,081
Are you all right?

324
00:15:14,116 --> 00:15:17,651
Yes, fine.
How go the wedding preparations?

325
00:15:17,686 --> 00:15:20,821
Oh... they're fine.

326
00:15:20,856 --> 00:15:22,389
Is there anything I can help with?

327
00:15:24,794 --> 00:15:29,263
Is that something that you'd
actually want to help with?

328
00:15:29,298 --> 00:15:31,765
You're acting like you think
I'd disapprove of it.

329
00:15:31,801 --> 00:15:35,302
Your husband is about to
welcome another husband

330
00:15:35,337 --> 00:15:37,104
into his bed.

331
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:38,839
You're a king.

332
00:15:38,874 --> 00:15:40,674
Of course you will.

333
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:44,144
I gather a three-person marriage
isn't normal on Earth?

334
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,381
Not outside of Utah.

335
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:48,849
Or some websites.

336
00:15:48,884 --> 00:15:52,786
Those are cities made of pixels, right?

337
00:15:52,822 --> 00:15:54,121
Close.

338
00:15:54,156 --> 00:15:57,224
My mission, so you understand it,

339
00:15:57,259 --> 00:15:59,726
is to protect our growing family.

340
00:15:59,762 --> 00:16:02,129
Your marriage to Idri means
a stronger kingdom

341
00:16:02,164 --> 00:16:03,897
to raise our child in.

342
00:16:03,933 --> 00:16:06,066
You are being way more
understanding about this

343
00:16:06,101 --> 00:16:08,101
than I would be in your shoes.

344
00:16:08,137 --> 00:16:09,703
That's my job.

345
00:16:12,241 --> 00:16:15,676
Look, I'm gonna go talk
to my royal chef.

346
00:16:15,711 --> 00:16:17,211
Care to join?

347
00:16:17,246 --> 00:16:18,312
Thanks.

348
00:16:18,347 --> 00:16:20,914
I'm... not feeling good.

349
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,950
It's morning sickness.

350
00:16:59,855 --> 00:17:01,822
Q, leave.

351
00:17:01,857 --> 00:17:02,857
I'm not going anywhere.

352
00:17:02,892 --> 00:17:04,124
Just open the door.

353
00:17:06,095 --> 00:17:07,995
Fuck, I could've...

354
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,229
I could've killed you.

355
00:17:12,201 --> 00:17:15,202
You know, I never...
I never once stopped to ask

356
00:17:15,237 --> 00:17:17,037
if I was doing the right thing.

357
00:17:19,975 --> 00:17:22,009
And now it's all I ask.

358
00:17:24,513 --> 00:17:27,014
If I did this,

359
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:29,049
would Q look at me like I'm evil?

360
00:17:33,923 --> 00:17:35,856
I can't...

361
00:17:35,891 --> 00:17:38,525
really feel any of it anymore.

362
00:17:40,362 --> 00:17:42,329
I'm doing it from memory.

363
00:17:46,802 --> 00:17:48,769
I'm broken.

364
00:17:48,804 --> 00:17:51,104
And that makes me dangerous.

365
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:54,007
So you should go.

366
00:17:54,043 --> 00:17:56,543
Jules...

367
00:17:56,578 --> 00:17:58,879
I talked to your Shade.

368
00:18:02,985 --> 00:18:06,153
Wait, so you saw her in a...

369
00:18:06,188 --> 00:18:09,323
Yeah, uh, I mean,
there were drugs involved.

370
00:18:09,358 --> 00:18:11,224
But I... I know that it was real.

371
00:18:12,494 --> 00:18:13,927
And she's still alive?

372
00:18:13,963 --> 00:18:15,529
Yeah.

373
00:18:15,564 --> 00:18:17,264
Well, I don't really know
if that term applies here,

374
00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:18,832
but she's not gone.

375
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:23,870
So where is she?

376
00:18:23,906 --> 00:18:26,139
I don't know.

377
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,041
But wherever she is,

378
00:18:28,077 --> 00:18:29,843
she wants us to find her.

379
00:18:33,415 --> 00:18:36,016
- What is this?
- Culinary classic.

380
00:18:36,051 --> 00:18:39,419
Oysters and pearls
from the French Laundry.

381
00:18:39,455 --> 00:18:41,455
I had to get Thomas Keller so wrecked

382
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,457
before he'd show me
the secret to that recipe.

383
00:18:48,897 --> 00:18:51,932
Mmm.

384
00:18:51,967 --> 00:18:54,968
I just don't think
it's "Fillory" enough.

385
00:18:55,004 --> 00:18:58,138
But half of Fillory eats boiled mutton.

386
00:18:58,173 --> 00:19:00,007
Let's introduce them to,
like, actual food.

387
00:19:00,042 --> 00:19:01,441
This is their world.

388
00:19:01,477 --> 00:19:03,343
We have to meet them halfway,
don't you think?

389
00:19:03,379 --> 00:19:05,012
Well, if half your recipe is shit,

390
00:19:05,047 --> 00:19:06,480
it's all going to taste like shit.

391
00:19:06,515 --> 00:19:08,448
Okay, okay. Fine, fine.

392
00:19:08,484 --> 00:19:10,217
Forget the dish.

393
00:19:10,252 --> 00:19:13,420
Let's start with, "What do you
want people to feel

394
00:19:13,455 --> 00:19:15,322
when they eat it?"

395
00:19:15,357 --> 00:19:18,025
I want everyone to like me.

396
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,926
Then let's just make this easy.

397
00:19:19,962 --> 00:19:22,195
I'll make a potion. Poof!

398
00:19:22,231 --> 00:19:23,630
They'll like you!

399
00:19:23,665 --> 00:19:26,066
- Donesies!
- I need this.

400
00:19:31,407 --> 00:19:32,873
There's nothing in here either.

401
00:19:32,908 --> 00:19:34,207
Got to keep looking.

402
00:19:34,243 --> 00:19:37,077
So scratchy.

403
00:19:37,112 --> 00:19:39,112
Go away, Todd.

404
00:19:39,148 --> 00:19:41,515
Stuff about the afterlife
is super wonky.

405
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:44,017
It's too close to religion.

406
00:19:44,053 --> 00:19:47,054
It's... it's hard to figure out
what's not a flat-out lie.

407
00:19:47,089 --> 00:19:48,121
Right?

408
00:19:48,157 --> 00:19:50,991
Hey, is this place real?

409
00:19:53,162 --> 00:19:54,461
No.

410
00:19:57,032 --> 00:19:58,498
You're hungover, Todd.

411
00:19:59,935 --> 00:20:01,902
Look, I found a passage here.

412
00:20:01,937 --> 00:20:04,604
Sort of vague, but it mentions Shades.

413
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,373
One passage in a dozen books?

414
00:20:06,408 --> 00:20:09,509
Oh, yeah. Yeah, Shades.

415
00:20:09,545 --> 00:20:10,677
I mean, something.

416
00:20:10,712 --> 00:20:12,212
Nobody talks about Shades.

417
00:20:12,247 --> 00:20:13,246
There's got to be a reason.

418
00:20:13,282 --> 00:20:14,915
I know, right?

419
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:18,985
I mean, when Fogg talked
about 'em the other day,

420
00:20:19,021 --> 00:20:21,555
it was the first I heard about 'em.

421
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,325
What?

422
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,296
My work study job...
I type up Fogg's memoirs.

423
00:20:29,331 --> 00:20:32,232
I guess he has, like, a crazy book deal.

424
00:20:32,267 --> 00:20:34,234
He's led a seriously weird life.

425
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:37,471
Did you know that he and Bob Ross

426
00:20:37,506 --> 00:20:40,574
had a dark artistic rivalry, and...

427
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:42,142
What did he say about Shades?

428
00:20:43,545 --> 00:20:46,313
Something like he knew someone

429
00:20:46,348 --> 00:20:48,682
who was obsessed with them?

430
00:20:48,717 --> 00:20:51,651
I do know... or I suppose I knew

431
00:20:51,687 --> 00:20:54,121
someone who was interested in Shades...

432
00:20:54,156 --> 00:20:55,455
was.

433
00:20:55,491 --> 00:20:58,024
Ah, it's rather confusing.

434
00:20:58,051 --> 00:21:01,128
- Confusing why?
- Because you know her too.

435
00:21:01,163 --> 00:21:02,496
It's Alice.

436
00:21:07,201 --> 00:21:09,669
Honestly, I don't think that
she knew anything about Shades.

437
00:21:09,705 --> 00:21:10,705
No, of course not.

438
00:21:11,101 --> 00:21:12,601
That Alice didn't.

439
00:21:12,636 --> 00:21:14,269
This Alice is a different story.

440
00:21:14,304 --> 00:21:15,771
What do you mean "this" Alice?

441
00:21:15,806 --> 00:21:18,340
Do you recall the time loop
I told you about?

442
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,208
The 39 lifetimes?

443
00:21:20,244 --> 00:21:22,077
No one remembers them except me.

444
00:21:22,112 --> 00:21:23,712
Yeah, of course. You knew another me.

445
00:21:23,747 --> 00:21:25,580
The Alice from the 23rd timeline

446
00:21:25,616 --> 00:21:28,150
was the sole survivor of The Beast.

447
00:21:28,185 --> 00:21:31,253
She became obsessed with the afterlife,

448
00:21:31,288 --> 00:21:34,389
how to commune with lost souls,

449
00:21:34,424 --> 00:21:36,091
and Shades.

450
00:21:36,126 --> 00:21:39,661
Would she know where one would go?

451
00:21:39,696 --> 00:21:41,096
I don't know what she knew.

452
00:21:41,131 --> 00:21:42,631
She just talked about them a lot.

453
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:45,333
She was different than your Alice.

454
00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:48,336
She was hurt... broken.

455
00:21:48,372 --> 00:21:49,738
We need to talk to her.

456
00:21:49,773 --> 00:21:52,174
Well, you can't. It's already happened.

457
00:21:52,209 --> 00:21:55,777
Essentially in another universe.

458
00:21:55,813 --> 00:21:59,281
It's gone.

459
00:21:59,316 --> 00:22:01,316
Well, what about a Tesla Flexion?

460
00:22:04,188 --> 00:22:06,421
What is it?

461
00:22:06,456 --> 00:22:08,557
It's how we could talk to her.

462
00:22:14,731 --> 00:22:16,331
Can I ask you a woman question?

463
00:22:16,366 --> 00:22:19,234
Ugh. I barely understand women.

464
00:22:19,269 --> 00:22:20,735
I think my pregnant wife

465
00:22:20,771 --> 00:22:24,105
might be having weird
pregnant wife feelings.

466
00:22:24,141 --> 00:22:25,340
Ew.

467
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:26,875
Definitely not my rice bowl.

468
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:31,346
She just seems like
her head is elsewhere

469
00:22:31,381 --> 00:22:32,647
all the time.

470
00:22:32,683 --> 00:22:33,648
What do you mean?

471
00:22:33,684 --> 00:22:35,250
Every time I run into her,

472
00:22:35,285 --> 00:22:37,352
I feel like I'm interrupting
a conversation.

473
00:22:37,387 --> 00:22:39,287
Except there's no one else there.

474
00:22:48,298 --> 00:22:50,832
What is it?

475
00:22:50,868 --> 00:22:53,335
Nothing.

476
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,237
I need some air.

477
00:23:03,747 --> 00:23:05,647
Fuzzbeat?

478
00:23:05,682 --> 00:23:07,249
It's, like, a website.

479
00:23:07,284 --> 00:23:09,517
They do serious news
and cat videos at the same time.

480
00:23:09,553 --> 00:23:11,186
That's fucking dumb.

481
00:23:11,221 --> 00:23:13,141
Well, it's where the tracking
spell said to go.

482
00:23:15,592 --> 00:23:17,359
We're looking for Harriet.

483
00:23:17,394 --> 00:23:18,894
And you are?

484
00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:20,762
Just tell we're from The Order.

485
00:23:20,797 --> 00:23:23,531
Is that the new Pilates place?

486
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:25,200
- Yes.
- Sweet.

487
00:23:31,742 --> 00:23:33,842
That's a fucking unicorn in a tutu.

488
00:23:42,386 --> 00:23:44,252
We're here for the book.

489
00:23:44,288 --> 00:23:46,655
"Principles of Conjuring Elementals."

490
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,790
It's ten years overdue.

491
00:23:49,826 --> 00:23:51,393
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

492
00:23:51,428 --> 00:23:54,262
She's not casting.

493
00:23:54,298 --> 00:23:55,764
She's signing.

494
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:57,766
Oh.

495
00:23:57,801 --> 00:23:59,467
Yeah, I... I don't...
I don't speak that.

496
00:23:59,503 --> 00:24:01,670
She said we don't look like librarians.

497
00:24:01,705 --> 00:24:04,239
All right, well, you know,

498
00:24:04,274 --> 00:24:05,774
tell her we're looking for the book.

499
00:24:07,811 --> 00:24:10,445
We need that book back.

500
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,646
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

501
00:24:11,682 --> 00:24:13,782
Your signing is terrible.

502
00:24:13,817 --> 00:24:17,619
Yeah, my signing's a little rusty.

503
00:24:33,537 --> 00:24:36,438
- What'd she say?
- Uh, don't worry about it.

504
00:24:38,542 --> 00:24:40,342
So what's your deal?

505
00:24:40,377 --> 00:24:44,779
You write listicles, and you do
magic in your spare time?

506
00:24:44,815 --> 00:24:45,847
No.

507
00:24:45,882 --> 00:24:47,816
This is my magic.

508
00:24:47,851 --> 00:24:49,517
What are you talking about?

509
00:24:49,553 --> 00:24:50,919
Your clickbait site?

510
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,726
Yeah, right.

511
00:24:57,761 --> 00:25:00,528
- What the fuck is she saying?
- Shh.

512
00:25:00,564 --> 00:25:01,930
See for yourself.

513
00:25:04,067 --> 00:25:07,535
"18 Pandas With Things
That Look Like Pandas"?

514
00:25:07,571 --> 00:25:09,337
Half of those don't
even look like pandas.

515
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:17,512
That's how to conjure dark matter!

516
00:25:17,547 --> 00:25:19,047
What did you do to the pandas?

517
00:25:19,082 --> 00:25:21,049
It's an encoded spell.

518
00:25:21,084 --> 00:25:22,484
All these articles are.

519
00:25:24,755 --> 00:25:26,454
Wait, wait, how about...

520
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:28,490
how about "Drunk Guys
Eating Kids' Vitamins"?

521
00:25:33,663 --> 00:25:35,663
No! Really?

522
00:25:35,699 --> 00:25:37,399
- Oh, my God, that's...
- Yeah, when you guys

523
00:25:37,434 --> 00:25:39,434
are done bonding, do you think
you could ask her

524
00:25:39,469 --> 00:25:40,869
for the book now, please?

525
00:25:40,904 --> 00:25:43,371
Relax, kid.

526
00:25:43,407 --> 00:25:45,573
I'll find it.

527
00:25:45,609 --> 00:25:46,609
Oh.

528
00:25:48,345 --> 00:25:49,644
Mm!

529
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:50,745
Just give us a sec.

530
00:25:54,785 --> 00:25:58,086
So I don't get it. Why do all this?

531
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,863
You're not wrong.

532
00:26:11,134 --> 00:26:14,369
Well, I was looking
for the kind of knowledge

533
00:26:14,404 --> 00:26:15,937
the Library doesn't have.

534
00:26:17,541 --> 00:26:19,541
Oh, the usual... beauty tips, recipes,

535
00:26:19,576 --> 00:26:21,009
how to kill a trickster god.

536
00:26:29,386 --> 00:26:30,552
Ah.

537
00:26:44,367 --> 00:26:47,001
- Here you go.
- Finally.

538
00:26:47,037 --> 00:26:48,436
Let's go.

539
00:26:48,472 --> 00:26:50,438
- Have a nice day.
- Fuck off.

540
00:27:01,518 --> 00:27:02,951
Thank you.

541
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:15,556
Why am I staring at a plate
of half-eaten nachos?

542
00:27:15,681 --> 00:27:18,219
A question I've asked myself
very often at 3:00 a.m.

543
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:21,374
- So I was doing the dishes...
- You're supposed to be cooking.

544
00:27:21,494 --> 00:27:22,835
I know. I...

545
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:25,571
kind of roofied the dishwasher.

546
00:27:25,606 --> 00:27:28,808
Um, that is not okay.

547
00:27:28,843 --> 00:27:31,577
No, not "roofied" roofied.

548
00:27:31,612 --> 00:27:33,746
Uh, more like he loves everyone so much,

549
00:27:33,781 --> 00:27:34,947
he's catatonic.

550
00:27:34,982 --> 00:27:36,215
It was an accident.

551
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:39,185
I was testing the potion for you.

552
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,487
Might have made it a little too strong.

553
00:27:41,522 --> 00:27:43,022
Forget it. Doesn't matter.

554
00:27:43,057 --> 00:27:45,825
The point is, I found this.

555
00:27:50,965 --> 00:27:54,133
"Wedding day. Western gate unguarded.

556
00:27:54,168 --> 00:27:56,602
Bring gifts there."

557
00:27:56,637 --> 00:27:59,505
I'm assuming they're not talking
about actual gifts.

558
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,973
No.

559
00:28:01,008 --> 00:28:02,842
They're talking about
chopping our heads off.

560
00:28:02,877 --> 00:28:04,009
Ooh.

561
00:28:04,045 --> 00:28:06,779
That backgammon-playing prick.

562
00:28:06,814 --> 00:28:09,014
Ah! I was so stupid.

563
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:11,083
After all the hours I spent
down in the dungeon,

564
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:13,052
I actually thought I'd won Bayler over.

565
00:28:13,087 --> 00:28:14,954
I thought I had rehabbed his soul.

566
00:28:14,989 --> 00:28:16,822
Oh, honey.

567
00:28:16,858 --> 00:28:20,659
We both know rehab is about more
than nachos and backgammon.

568
00:28:20,695 --> 00:28:21,894
Is it?

569
00:28:21,929 --> 00:28:23,796
Is it, Margo?

570
00:28:23,831 --> 00:28:27,032
Wait, so you're upset because
the guy who tried to kill you

571
00:28:27,068 --> 00:28:29,535
is gonna try and kill you again?

572
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:30,770
I should've executed him.

573
00:28:30,805 --> 00:28:31,771
It's not like anybody likes me anyway.

574
00:28:31,806 --> 00:28:33,205
I'm down 5%.

575
00:28:33,241 --> 00:28:35,841
And now the Fu Fighters
are gonna red my wedding!

576
00:28:35,877 --> 00:28:37,076
No.

577
00:28:37,111 --> 00:28:39,111
Okay? We won't let that happen.

578
00:28:40,281 --> 00:28:42,014
Josh, where's that dishwasher?

579
00:28:42,049 --> 00:28:43,015
Still in the armoire.

580
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:44,917
Why is he in the armoire?

581
00:28:44,952 --> 00:28:47,052
'Cause I'm not good in a crisis, okay?

582
00:28:47,088 --> 00:28:50,055
How were you ever a drug dealer?

583
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:54,994
Look, that note was meant
for the dishwasher.

584
00:28:55,029 --> 00:28:57,563
He's probably been passing
messages to the Fu Fighters

585
00:28:57,598 --> 00:28:59,498
this whole time, so here's what we do.

586
00:28:59,534 --> 00:29:01,100
We help him sober up, and then...

587
00:29:01,135 --> 00:29:02,868
We execute him.

588
00:29:02,904 --> 00:29:04,303
No.

589
00:29:04,338 --> 00:29:07,106
But it means so much to me
that you want to.

590
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:10,976
We put the note back
into the dirty dishes.

591
00:29:11,012 --> 00:29:14,580
We let him find it and take it
back to the Fu Fighters' base.

592
00:29:14,615 --> 00:29:15,781
Josh?

593
00:29:15,817 --> 00:29:17,583
How much of that potion can you make?

594
00:29:17,618 --> 00:29:19,718
I...I don't know. A buttload?

595
00:29:19,754 --> 00:29:20,953
That'll do.

596
00:29:24,258 --> 00:29:26,225
Bambi, what are you casting?

597
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,260
Tracking spell.

598
00:29:28,296 --> 00:29:29,962
Then we'll know exactly where to find

599
00:29:29,997 --> 00:29:32,198
those Dave Grohl-wannabe bitches.

600
00:29:37,071 --> 00:29:38,237
Gotcha.

601
00:29:38,272 --> 00:29:40,272
The Fu Fighters' encampment.

602
00:29:40,308 --> 00:29:42,341
Okay, guys, here you go.

603
00:29:42,376 --> 00:29:46,011
Aw, it's a shame, isn't it, El?

604
00:29:46,047 --> 00:29:48,581
Utter shame.

605
00:29:48,616 --> 00:29:49,815
I mean, I can't be the one

606
00:29:49,851 --> 00:29:52,051
to sneak into the Fu Fighters' base.

607
00:29:52,086 --> 00:29:53,619
Certainly not. You don't sneak.

608
00:29:53,654 --> 00:29:54,987
Mm-mm.

609
00:29:55,022 --> 00:29:56,922
And you can't be the one
to dump that potion

610
00:29:56,958 --> 00:30:00,626
into whatever disgusting stew
they're cooking for dinner.

611
00:30:00,661 --> 00:30:01,894
Sadly, no.

612
00:30:01,929 --> 00:30:04,163
My eminence is too easy
to spot from afar.

613
00:30:04,198 --> 00:30:05,798
Hmm.

614
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:08,801
If only we had someone
they'd never seen...

615
00:30:08,836 --> 00:30:12,371
Guys, stop the bit. I'll go.

616
00:30:12,406 --> 00:30:17,343
Eternal glory awaits you,
O Joshua of Yonkers.

617
00:30:17,378 --> 00:30:21,046
Eternal glory.

618
00:30:21,082 --> 00:30:22,281
You done?

619
00:30:22,316 --> 00:30:24,116
I'm done.

620
00:30:24,151 --> 00:30:25,351
Great.

621
00:30:31,158 --> 00:30:33,259
Here's your overdue book.

622
00:30:33,294 --> 00:30:36,262
Now can you find me some shit
to help with my hands, please?

623
00:30:36,297 --> 00:30:38,898
I will look for some thing

624
00:30:38,933 --> 00:30:40,900
to help you with that in just a moment.

625
00:30:57,318 --> 00:30:59,151
Are you okay?

626
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,826
Uh, hello?

627
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:14,366
Uh, I asked you a question, man.

628
00:31:14,402 --> 00:31:16,135
- Are you okay?
- No!

629
00:31:17,772 --> 00:31:19,705
I can't control my...

630
00:31:19,888 --> 00:31:21,088
look out!

631
00:31:26,714 --> 00:31:28,247
No!

632
00:31:30,351 --> 00:31:33,548
I can't... stop!

633
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:55,823
The card was cursed. A Modus Hex.

634
00:31:55,851 --> 00:31:57,884
It forces you to perform
an action against your will.

635
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,486
Yeah, but that dude killed himself.

636
00:31:59,521 --> 00:32:01,054
Okay? The hex didn't make him do that.

637
00:32:01,090 --> 00:32:02,623
His name was Howard.

638
00:32:02,658 --> 00:32:04,825
And if it wasn't for his bravery,

639
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,426
the hex would have forced him
to do something

640
00:32:06,462 --> 00:32:07,928
incredibly dangerous.

641
00:32:07,963 --> 00:32:09,529
Open a door?

642
00:32:09,565 --> 00:32:10,998
It isn't just any door.

643
00:32:11,033 --> 00:32:12,966
Then what is it?

644
00:32:13,002 --> 00:32:14,935
As a novice of The Order,
there are many secrets

645
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,670
that will be imparted to you
when the time is right.

646
00:32:16,705 --> 00:32:17,871
I just watched a man kill himself!

647
00:32:17,906 --> 00:32:19,106
What's behind the door?

648
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,610
The Poison Room.

649
00:32:23,646 --> 00:32:25,445
The what?

650
00:32:25,481 --> 00:32:27,547
It's where we store books
too dangerous for the public.

651
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:30,450
I suspect Harriet's curse was an
attempt to steal its contents.

652
00:32:30,486 --> 00:32:32,085
Wait, Howard kamikazed himself

653
00:32:32,121 --> 00:32:34,454
'cause someone wanted some banned books?

654
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,657
That's pretty fucked up!

655
00:32:36,692 --> 00:32:38,325
What is...

656
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:41,028
fucked up is that there
is knowledge out there

657
00:32:41,063 --> 00:32:42,596
so dangerous we need a Poison Room

658
00:32:42,631 --> 00:32:44,064
so it doesn't fall into the wrong hands.

659
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:47,601
That is why Howard sacrificed his life.

660
00:32:47,636 --> 00:32:49,536
It's something all Librarians would do.

661
00:32:49,571 --> 00:32:51,471
So he had to die to keep
someone from getting

662
00:32:51,507 --> 00:32:53,473
their hands on what?

663
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:55,375
Some crazy battle magic?

664
00:32:55,411 --> 00:32:57,110
There is knowledge
behind that door, Penny,

665
00:32:57,146 --> 00:33:00,514
that could destroy more
than just people.

666
00:33:00,549 --> 00:33:03,817
It could destroy worlds.

667
00:33:03,852 --> 00:33:06,453
The Tesla Flexion has only
been successfully employed

668
00:33:06,488 --> 00:33:07,888
once before.

669
00:33:07,923 --> 00:33:10,691
Luckily, we're using
the original equipment,

670
00:33:10,726 --> 00:33:12,993
left to Brakebills by
the man who invented it.

671
00:33:13,028 --> 00:33:14,428
Nikola Tesla?

672
00:33:14,463 --> 00:33:16,530
No, Fred Flexion.

673
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,133
Okay.

674
00:33:20,169 --> 00:33:22,703
And it's only been used
once before because...

675
00:33:22,738 --> 00:33:25,639
Three people died trying
to shut it down last time.

676
00:33:25,674 --> 00:33:27,407
What's the tent for?

677
00:33:27,443 --> 00:33:30,610
The Flexion is a fold between
two different realities.

678
00:33:30,646 --> 00:33:32,946
The tented area is where
they cross over.

679
00:33:32,981 --> 00:33:35,115
Now, Ms. Wicker and I will work together

680
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,550
to cast the Flexion,

681
00:33:36,585 --> 00:33:38,719
but if we hold it longer
than two minutes,

682
00:33:38,754 --> 00:33:41,021
we will all die.

683
00:33:41,056 --> 00:33:43,056
Well, don't sugarcoat it.

684
00:33:43,092 --> 00:33:44,758
Quentin...

685
00:33:47,429 --> 00:33:48,895
Get the answers that you need,

686
00:33:48,931 --> 00:33:51,064
and then get out.

687
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,433
Understood?

688
00:33:53,469 --> 00:33:56,937
And try not to touch anything in there.

689
00:33:56,972 --> 00:33:59,139
Okay. Why?

690
00:33:59,174 --> 00:34:00,540
Matter from different realities

691
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,975
occupying the same space

692
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:03,176
can create a paradox.

693
00:34:03,212 --> 00:34:05,979
More like an explosion.

694
00:34:06,014 --> 00:34:08,181
As well a mess of problems
for the people who'd find

695
00:34:08,217 --> 00:34:10,917
what's left of our bodies.

696
00:34:10,953 --> 00:34:12,552
Touch nothing.

697
00:34:12,588 --> 00:34:14,054
Got it.

698
00:34:15,991 --> 00:34:18,058
Dude, their shit was
seriously jacked up.

699
00:34:18,093 --> 00:34:20,594
Their K-holes were inside K-holes.

700
00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:22,529
Does that even make sense?

701
00:34:22,564 --> 00:34:24,064
I'm just saying, the Fu Fighters

702
00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:27,100
are out of "comish"
for the foreseeable future.

703
00:34:27,136 --> 00:34:29,002
Your wedding may proceed apace, sire.

704
00:34:29,037 --> 00:34:33,640
And you, good sir, may shave
any nymph in the kingdom.

705
00:34:33,675 --> 00:34:36,743
- Like right now?
- Like right now.

706
00:34:36,779 --> 00:34:39,746
You are my once and future king.

707
00:34:44,086 --> 00:34:45,886
Just floating this:

708
00:34:45,921 --> 00:34:49,089
would it be weird if I fucked Josh?

709
00:34:49,124 --> 00:34:51,691
I certainly hope it would be weird.

710
00:34:54,129 --> 00:34:56,830
To my quick-thinking Bambi,

711
00:34:56,865 --> 00:34:58,832
who saved the day again.

712
00:35:01,837 --> 00:35:03,203
Speaking of saving the day,

713
00:35:03,238 --> 00:35:06,640
did you ever manage to talk to Fen?

714
00:35:06,675 --> 00:35:09,509
Um, yeah.

715
00:35:09,545 --> 00:35:10,710
She's fine.

716
00:35:10,746 --> 00:35:11,845
Good.

717
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,079
That's a relief.

718
00:35:14,983 --> 00:35:18,251
Fen? Fen!

719
00:35:25,127 --> 00:35:27,828
I want to talk to you about
the terms of our deal.

720
00:35:35,003 --> 00:35:36,937
Oh, shit.

721
00:35:36,972 --> 00:35:39,005
- Shit, shit...
- You saw it?

722
00:35:39,041 --> 00:35:41,041
You saw it too.

723
00:35:41,076 --> 00:35:42,042
Fen!

724
00:35:42,077 --> 00:35:44,010
I'm not going mad.

725
00:35:44,046 --> 00:35:47,280
Well...

726
00:35:47,316 --> 00:35:49,549
no.

727
00:35:49,585 --> 00:35:51,218
You're not.

728
00:35:51,253 --> 00:35:54,054
It was a fairy, okay?

729
00:35:54,089 --> 00:35:56,156
Look, the day The Wellspring failed,

730
00:35:56,191 --> 00:35:58,291
I made a deal to save Eliot's life.

731
00:35:58,327 --> 00:35:59,793
You did, too.

732
00:35:59,828 --> 00:36:01,628
I don't understand.

733
00:36:01,663 --> 00:36:03,864
You agreed to do whatever
it took to save him.

734
00:36:03,899 --> 00:36:05,031
But I didn't.

735
00:36:05,067 --> 00:36:07,634
Well, you did.

736
00:36:07,669 --> 00:36:08,902
What do they want?

737
00:36:10,739 --> 00:36:12,305
Your baby.

738
00:36:12,341 --> 00:36:14,207
- What?
- Fen...

739
00:36:14,243 --> 00:36:16,076
I can stop this.

740
00:36:16,111 --> 00:36:18,211
You better fix this, because I
will not let them

741
00:36:18,247 --> 00:36:19,813
take my child.

742
00:36:23,886 --> 00:36:26,553
Fuck.

743
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,768
Quentin?

744
00:37:14,803 --> 00:37:15,835
Is that you?

745
00:37:15,871 --> 00:37:17,103
You're in a Tesla Flexion.

746
00:37:17,139 --> 00:37:19,172
I'm from another timeline.

747
00:37:19,207 --> 00:37:20,740
We only have two minutes.

748
00:37:20,776 --> 00:37:22,776
I need you to tell me
everything you know

749
00:37:22,811 --> 00:37:24,244
about Shades.

750
00:37:24,279 --> 00:37:26,012
It is you.

751
00:37:26,048 --> 00:37:27,781
Another you... you're alive.

752
00:37:27,816 --> 00:37:30,784
No, stop. We can't touch.

753
00:37:30,819 --> 00:37:32,152
I'm sorry. We have to go fast.

754
00:37:32,187 --> 00:37:33,987
I understand.

755
00:37:34,022 --> 00:37:35,889
Um...

756
00:37:35,924 --> 00:37:37,023
I'll tell you everything I know.

757
00:37:37,059 --> 00:37:38,925
It's just...

758
00:37:38,961 --> 00:37:40,827
I thought I'd never see you again.

759
00:37:40,862 --> 00:37:43,830
The Beast, he... he tore you apart

760
00:37:43,865 --> 00:37:45,865
piece by piece, but not just your body,

761
00:37:45,901 --> 00:37:47,801
but your... your Shade, everything.

762
00:37:47,836 --> 00:37:49,402
My Shade. Do you know where it went?

763
00:37:49,438 --> 00:37:52,372
I searched everywhere for it.

764
00:37:52,407 --> 00:37:54,674
You can't rest in peace without it.

765
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:57,711
But there are no books on how to do...

766
00:37:57,746 --> 00:38:00,046
so I traveled the world in
search of anyone, anything,

767
00:38:00,082 --> 00:38:01,247
that could help me.

768
00:38:01,283 --> 00:38:03,750
What did you learn?

769
00:38:03,785 --> 00:38:06,820
Shades go to The Underworld.

770
00:38:06,855 --> 00:38:08,021
There's an Underworld?

771
00:38:08,056 --> 00:38:09,889
It's only accessible to the dead.

772
00:38:09,925 --> 00:38:11,825
But there's a catch.

773
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,060
Alice, what happened to your hand?

774
00:38:14,096 --> 00:38:15,895
Doesn't matter.

775
00:38:15,931 --> 00:38:19,232
It's the least I gave up to learn this.

776
00:38:22,804 --> 00:38:24,738
The living can access The Underworld

777
00:38:24,773 --> 00:38:25,973
with the help of a Gatekeeper.

778
00:38:26,008 --> 00:38:27,941
- A Gatekeeper?
- An ancient one.

779
00:38:27,976 --> 00:38:30,210
A being older than the world itself.

780
00:38:30,245 --> 00:38:33,046
Okay, how do you find one of those?

781
00:38:33,081 --> 00:38:35,215
I don't know.

782
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:38,351
I'm still looking.

783
00:38:43,191 --> 00:38:45,125
- I have to go.
- Please, please...

784
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,459
just one more thing.

785
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,396
We can't hold it much longer, Quentin!

786
00:38:49,431 --> 00:38:52,332
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

787
00:38:52,367 --> 00:38:54,367
Sorry for what?

788
00:38:56,104 --> 00:38:58,838
When you died,

789
00:38:58,874 --> 00:39:00,774
we weren't in a good place.

790
00:39:02,377 --> 00:39:05,145
We were... we were fighting,

791
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:09,315
and I was too proud to... to let it go.

792
00:39:12,988 --> 00:39:14,754
I don't know what that
other Quentin felt,

793
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:17,957
but in this world, I love you.

794
00:39:17,993 --> 00:39:19,726
Okay.

795
00:39:19,761 --> 00:39:22,262
No matter what.

796
00:39:22,297 --> 00:39:24,030
I love you.

797
00:39:47,444 --> 00:39:49,945
Yeah, but Harriet didn't know
the guy was gonna kill himself.

798
00:39:50,023 --> 00:39:51,447
Are you defending her?

799
00:39:51,483 --> 00:39:54,990
No, I'm just saying that
she's not totally wrong.

800
00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:57,694
The Librarians are hiding something.

801
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:59,573
Yeah, things that are
insanely dangerous.

802
00:39:59,598 --> 00:40:01,164
They could have good reasons.

803
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:02,365
Okay, and who the fuck
are librarians to decide

804
00:40:02,401 --> 00:40:04,100
who gets what?

805
00:40:04,136 --> 00:40:05,969
Do you really want every
Hedge Witch with a grudge

806
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:08,471
and a bad idea to get a nuclear bomb?

807
00:40:08,507 --> 00:40:10,507
Fuck you.

808
00:40:10,542 --> 00:40:12,475
I'm not talking about you.

809
00:40:12,511 --> 00:40:15,512
Yeah, you are.

810
00:40:15,547 --> 00:40:18,948
No, I'm not.

811
00:40:18,984 --> 00:40:20,350
Think we might be too late.

812
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:22,986
Motherfucker.

813
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:27,457
No.

814
00:40:27,492 --> 00:40:29,125
No, no...

815
00:40:46,211 --> 00:40:49,379
"The Ars Deicidium"?

816
00:40:49,414 --> 00:40:51,014
"The Art of Killing Gods."

817
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:57,220
Eliot? Oh, thank God.

818
00:40:57,255 --> 00:40:59,055
I don't know what to do.

819
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,757
Margo made a deal with
the fairies and they're

820
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:03,092
coming for our baby.

821
00:41:05,764 --> 00:41:07,730
A deal is a deal.

822
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:17,407
You've been staring
at that page for an hour.

823
00:41:18,777 --> 00:41:20,410
Oh.

824
00:41:23,114 --> 00:41:25,148
I just keep seeing her face.

825
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:32,555
I get that you're hurting.

826
00:41:35,694 --> 00:41:38,061
I don't know what to say
to make you feel better.

827
00:41:38,096 --> 00:41:40,363
It's okay.

828
00:41:40,398 --> 00:41:42,699
I don't really want
to feel better anyway.

829
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:58,991
Maybe I better not show you this then.

830
00:41:59,784 --> 00:42:02,252
I think I figured out
what an Ancient One is.

831
00:42:09,294 --> 00:42:11,494
No fucking way.
