Mmm, I don't know.

188
00:08:05,058 --> 00:08:07,325

why they hate me so much,

to murder me.

Ugh.

199
00:08:31,118 --> 00:08:32,617
Historically,

200
00:08:32,653 --> 00:08:35,654
a royal wedding is the perfect
time for a monarch

201
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:37,122
to make their appeal
to the people.

202
00:08:37,157 --> 00:08:39,090
Idri prefers a private ceremony.

203
00:08:39,126 --> 00:08:41,059
But what if you went public?

204
00:08:41,094 --> 00:08:43,194
Might improve your polling.

205
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:49,100
One for $20, three for $50.

206
00:08:49,136 --> 00:08:52,070
