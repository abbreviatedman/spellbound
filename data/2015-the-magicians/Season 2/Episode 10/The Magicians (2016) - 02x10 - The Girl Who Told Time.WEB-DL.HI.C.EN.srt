why they hate me so much,

Ugh. Can we not?

199
00:08:32,218 --> 00:08:33,717
Historically,

200
00:08:33,753 --> 00:08:36,754
a royal wedding is the perfect
time for a monarch

201
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:38,222
to make their appeal to the people.

202
00:08:38,257 --> 00:08:40,190
Idri prefers a private ceremony.

203
00:08:40,226 --> 00:08:42,159
But what if you went public?

204
00:08:42,194 --> 00:08:44,294
Might improve your polling.

205
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:50,200
One for $20, three for $50.

206
00:08:50,236 --> 00:08:53,170
Which gets you the highest?

207

Yes, he asked for you specifically.
