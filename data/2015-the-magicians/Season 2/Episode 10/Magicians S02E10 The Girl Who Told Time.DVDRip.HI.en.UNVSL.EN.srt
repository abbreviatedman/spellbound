00:00:00,968 --> 00:00:02,493
QUENTIN: <i>Previously
on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:04,902
This contract initiates our
services in exchange for...

3
00:00:04,972 --> 00:00:07,237
Unlimited manual
and magical labor?

4
00:00:07,307 --> 00:00:09,970
You signed that insane
contract? Yeah, it's okay.

5
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:11,739
How the hell is that okay?

6
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:12,973
Because I get magic back.

7
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:14,309
Did you do this for me?

8
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:17,476
I'm Bayler. A proud
soldier of Fillorians United.

9
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:21,318
And we will not rest until a
Fillorian sits upon the throne.

10
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:23,117
The Fairies can bring
back the Wellspring?

11
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,190
They can.

12
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:25,315
And in return?

13
00:00:25,392 --> 00:00:27,293
A royal child of Whitespire.

14
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,361
We're getting married.

15
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:29,896
Apparently, all monarchs

16
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:32,865
<i>are entitled to one of
each, a wife and a husband.</i>

17
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:35,198
Alice, I hope you meant it.

18
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:38,762
I hope you just go
and do beautiful magic.

19
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:40,535
<i>Quentin says go free.</i>

20
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:43,099
KADY: <i>You fed him to Reynard.</i>

21

JULIA: <i>He knew how to survive.</i>

22
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,605
KADY: <i>Yeah, by
doing what you want!</i>

23
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,582
<i>That's all you see
anymore, is what you want.</i>

24
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,744
You don't feel anymore, Julia,

25
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,286
not the way a human does.

26
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:56,118
Do you remember the gift
that Jane was given in the book

27
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,623
<i>The Girl Who Told Time?</i>

28
00:00:57,691 --> 00:00:59,956
<i>Ember gave her the
ability to fuck with time,</i>

29
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:01,154
<i>on a cosmic scale.</i>

30
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,629
<i>And Jane used it
to create a time loop.</i>

31
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:07,156
<i>In each loop, Jane
alters something</i>

32
00:01:07,234 --> 00:01:08,311
to see if it'll change
the outcome.

33
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:09,769
What's different this time?

34
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,101
I was at Brakebills? QUENTIN:
You were supposed to be.

35
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:14,300
Or you were, like, 39 times.

36
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:15,933
You were the thing they changed.

37
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:26,110
Very impressive, Ms. Wicker.

38
00:01:26,186 --> 00:01:27,711
Let me do it again.

39
00:01:27,788 --> 00:01:29,780
I was wondering
what would happen

40
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:33,156
if I connected the sequence
with Atsuko's Spectral Refraction.

41
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:35,526
All right.

42
00:01:36,897 --> 00:01:38,297
(EXHALES)

43
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:46,405
(CHUCKLES)

44
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,240
That is a second-year spell.

45
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:55,839
I read ahead.

46
00:01:55,916 --> 00:02:00,377
More than that, you understood
the theory behind the spell,

47
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:03,447
and you reshaped it.

48
00:02:03,523 --> 00:02:07,927
Your discipline is meta-composition.
You are a Knowledge student.

49
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:09,495
Knowledge?

50
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:11,003
Mmm-hmm. Part
psychic, part physical.

51
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:13,466
There really is no
branch it doesn't touch on.

52
00:02:13,533 --> 00:02:16,901
The short version, you
are drawn, mind and body,

53
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,364
to the discovery of magic.

54
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:21,374
Is it true that they, uh...

55
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:24,240
That we live in the
attic above the Library?

56
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:27,878
I assure you, it is much
more luxurious than it sounds.

57
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:30,281
No, I mean, that
sounds like bliss, actually.

58
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,818
I enjoyed it.

59
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:33,777
You were a Knowledge student?

60
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:35,322
I am a Knowledge student.

61
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,551
It doesn't end with your degree.

62
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,388
You have a rare gift, Julia.

63
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:43,920
And I must admit I am envious
of the many rich discoveries

64
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,330
that you have ahead
of you. Welcome.

65
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:49,767
Thank you.

00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,650
You are free to go.

68
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:10,548
Why would you let me go?

69
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:14,220
DEAN: Because, Ms. Wicker,
you are not a student here,

70
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,793
and I am not running a jail.

71
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:20,225
Kady locked me up
for a good reason.

72
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:23,833
I should feel terrible
about what I did.

73
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,867
But I don't.

74
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:31,907
I just think it's terrible,

75
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:35,437
and I think I would have
never done it if I were me.

76
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:38,007
One thing I've learned
about you, Ms. Wicker,

77
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:40,281
is that you are a searcher.

78
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:45,319
You don't know me.

79
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:47,987
Thirty-nine times,
I've known you,

80
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:52,622
which is why I trust that you'll
put aside your fear and self-pity

81
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:56,899
and look for the answers
that can save you.

82
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,776
ELIOT: Why am I the only
one worried about this wedding?

83
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:06,846
Mmm...

Congratulations. You failed.

00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,920
King needs more wine.

87
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,581
Of course, sire.

88
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,521
I feel bad. I forgot your name.

89
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:20,026
It's Smedley, sire.

90
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,028
Smedley. Thanks, Smedley.

91
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,559
Hey, I'll take that.

92
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:27,262
Oh, no. Wait. I'm not done.

93
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:28,962
I think you were.

94
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:33,295
Not cool. Those grapes
died for nothing now.

95
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,842
Those grapes died
so you might live,

96
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:39,778
because if you keep drinking,
I will seriously cut a bitch.

97

You never yell at
Eliot for being drunk.

98

Because Eliot's fun. You're
depressing. It's been three months.

99
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:49,551
Technically, it's only been a
couple of days on Earth, so...

100
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:53,424
Three months on
Fillory of Emo Quentin.

101
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,859
Not my favorite Quentin.

102
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:58,125

liked any of the Quentins.

he needs things. It's...

Earth errands.

rub one out in a hot bath

fuck would Fogg let Julia go?

I mean, haven't you ever
noticed? Fogg isn't that helpful.

122
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:58,890
Plus, you knew he couldn't
keep her in there forever.

123
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,360
Yeah, well, I thought she'd at
least be in there long enough

out what to do next.

Reynard to deal with,

127

want to run into Julia.

time you tried to help,

me any more than they did.

177
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,246
But what if you went public?

178
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:44,314
Might improve your polling.

179
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,288
One for $20, three for $50.

180
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,026
Which gets you the highest?

181
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,034
Highest?

from heirloom seed stock,

for a curated drug experience.

This will make you levitate.

185
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:04,635
This is like being
hugged by a rainbow.

186
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:08,307
This is like being blown by a
rainbow. Do not mix these up.

187
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,145
Yeah, I'll take six.

188
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:15,216
So the High King needs me?

189
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,481
Yes, he asked
for you specifically.

190
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,720
A command performance.
Righteous. (CHUCKLES)

191
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:25,455
How are... How are you doing?

192
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:28,969
The last time I saw you,
you weren't doing so good.

193
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:30,936
Whatever happened
with the whole, uh...

194
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:33,530
I let her go. I'm fine.

Abilify in Fillory,

197
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:40,303
but I have been improvising.

198
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,249
Well, this is Doctor
Josh's prescription.

199
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:48,053
I mean, we don't have to race
off to Fillory right this second.

200
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:51,088
We have a minute. What's it do?

201
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:54,650

into other worlds. It's rad.

00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:25,691
Um...

207
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,052
You look familiar.

208
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,425
Holy shit, Julia.

209
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:35,301
Why do you look
like a 12-year-old?

210
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,269
Because I'm her Shade.

211
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:42,508
Oh, Q, I'm so happy
to see you again.

212
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:43,907
I really, really missed you.

213
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:47,879
Her Shade? I thought
that you were gone.

214
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,144
I'm lost. I can't
find my way home.

215
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:54,748
This is getting less rad.

Please, Quentin,

217
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,154
I've been looking for a way out,

218
00:10:58,224 --> 00:10:59,954
and then suddenly
I could see you.

219
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:04,028
Yeah, you're in
another world. Um...

220
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:05,924
Where are you?

221
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,365
I have no idea.

222
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:12,369
I can't stay here. Time is
running out. Can you help me?

223
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:14,839
Yeah, I'll try. How
can I find you?

I don't know. I don't
even know how I got here.

have to get back to Julia.

Don't be ridiculous. You
have far too much to do here.

236
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,490
No, I had a vision, okay?

237
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,825
A way that I can
maybe help Julia.

238
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,498
I can't ignore it.

Can't you?

00:12:14,767 --> 00:12:17,362
It was a motherfucking

how else to say it.

Can you help me
find some information?

249
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:45,124
Of course. What
are you looking for?

an enormous amount of power.

might, you know, defeat them?

252
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,038
How much power?

253
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,237
Let's say, god-like?

254
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:00,112
So classical myths.

255
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:03,479
No. More like a how-to manual.

Oh.

I'm afraid we don't
have any books available

261

on that particular topic.

262
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:44,688
There's nothing in the entire
Library of the Neitherlands

263
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,749
on killing any kind of god?

264
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,990
Have you considered that it might
not be strictly possible to do so?

265
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:52,862
Didn't the Norse gods kill
each other, like, all the time?

266

The Library is full of stories.

Fillory, The Beast killed Umber.

They told me there
are books to help me,

278
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:38,605
but I'd have to do the
research on my own time.

supposed to do in the meantime?

down overdue books.

00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:14,049
Let's start with
what do you want

351
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,850
people to feel when they eat it?

352
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:18,716
I want everyone to like me.

353
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,323
Then let's just make this easy.

354
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:22,418
I'll make a potion.

355
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:24,998
Poof! They'll like you.

356
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:26,064
Donesies!

357
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:27,464
I need this.

358
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,101
There's nothing in here, either.

359
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,903
Got to keep looking.
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

360
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:38,344
So scratchy.

361
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,335
Go away, Todd.

362
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:43,449
Stuff about the
afterlife is super-wonky.

363
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,712
It's too close to religion.

364
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:49,017
It's hard to figure out what's
not a flat-out lie. Right?

365
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:50,379
TODD: Hey...

366
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:52,081
Is this place real?

367
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:55,551
No.

368
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:00,297
You're hungover, Todd.

369
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,032
Look, I found a passage here.

370
00:20:03,102 --> 00:20:05,435
Sort of vague, but
it mentions Shades.

371
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,936
One passage in a dozen books.

372
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:10,738
Oh, yeah. Yeah, Shades.

373
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,443
JULIA: I mean, it's something.

374
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:14,810
Nobody talks about Shades.
There's got to be a reason.

375
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,285
I know, right? I mean, when Fogg
talked about them the other day,

376
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,548
it was the first I
heard about them.

377
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:26,650
What?

378
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,422
My work study job,

379
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:30,360
I type up Fogg's memoirs.

380
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:33,593
I guess he has, like,
a crazy book deal.

381
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,601
He's led a seriously weird life.

382
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:38,695
Did you know that
he and Bob Ross

383
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:41,570
had a dark artistic
rivalry? I mean...

384
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,836
What did he say about Shades?

385
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:50,041
Something like he knew someone
who was obsessed with them.

386
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:52,883
DEAN: <i>I do know
or, I suppose, I knew</i>

387
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:55,478
someone who is
interested in Shades.

388
00:20:55,821 --> 00:20:59,258
Was. Uh, it's rather confusing.

389
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:00,549
Confusing, why?

390
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:02,595
Because you know her, too.

391
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:03,788
It's Alice.

392
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:13,099
Honestly, I don't think that she
knew anything about Shades.

393
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:15,937
No, of course not.
That Alice didn't.

394
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,601
This Alice is a different story.

395
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,110
What do you mean, "this Alice"?

396
00:21:19,178 --> 00:21:21,704
Do you recall the time
loop I told you about?

397
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:25,343
The 39 lifetimes? No one
remembers them except me.

398
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,079
Yeah, of course.
You knew another me.

399
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:29,145
The Alice from the 23rd timeline

400
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:31,156
was the sole
survivor of The Beast.

401
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:34,284
She became obsessed
with the afterlife,

402
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:38,854
how to commune with
lost souls and Shades.

403
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:42,969
Okay, well, would she
know where one would go?

404
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:46,572
I don't know what she knew.
She just talked about them a lot.

405
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:49,165
She was different
than your Alice.

406
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:51,437
She was hurt, broken.

407
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,069
We need to talk to her.

408
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:56,047
Well, you can't. It's
already happened.

409
00:21:56,115 --> 00:21:58,243
Essentially, in
another universe.

410
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,151
It's gone.

411
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:04,352
What about a Tesla Flexion?

412
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:08,492
What is it?

413
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,221
It's how we could talk to her.

414
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:19,503
Can I ask you a woman question?

415
00:22:19,638 --> 00:22:22,472
(SCOFFS) I barely
understand women.

416
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:27,241
I think my pregnant wife might be
having weird pregnant-wife feelings.

417
00:22:27,313 --> 00:22:28,542
Ew.

418
00:22:28,614 --> 00:22:31,106
Definitely not my rice bowl.

419
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:35,821
Seems like her head is
elsewhere all the time.

420
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,088
What do you mean?

421
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:38,488
Every time I run into her,

422
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:40,992
I feel like I'm interrupting
a conversation,

423
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,722
except there's
no one else there.

424
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,399
What is it?

425
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:58,205
Nothing. I'll talk to her.
(EXHALES) I need some air.

426
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:00,404
Yeah.

427

428
00:23:09,088 --> 00:23:10,181
It's like a website.

429
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:13,454
They do serious news and
cat videos at the same time.

430
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:14,549
That's fucking dumb.

431
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:16,467
Well, it's where the
tracking spell said to go.

432
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:21,191
We're looking for Harriet?

433
00:23:21,267 --> 00:23:22,267
And you are?

434
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:24,064
Just tell her we're
from The Order.

435
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:25,866
Is that the new Pilates place?

436
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,072
Yes.

437
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,301
Sweet.

438
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:35,213
Okay.

Yeah, I don't speak that.

look like Librarians.

447

All right, well, you know, tell
her we're looking for the book.

448
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,642
We need that book back.

451
00:24:17,323 --> 00:24:20,885

do magic in your spare time?

456
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,983
No, this is my magic.

Yeah, right.

460
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:04,998

to conjure dark matter.

What did you do to the pandas?

It's an encoded spell.

Well, I was looking for
the kind of knowledge

00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:19,244
the Library doesn't have.

a plate of half-eaten nachos?

myself very often at 3:00 a.m.

roofied the dishwasher.

testing the potion for you.

it a little too strong.

talking about actual gifts.

is gonna try and kill you again?

Why is he in the armoire?

We put the note back
in to the dirty dishes.

524
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:19,722
We let him find it, and take it
back to the FU Fighters' base.

525
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:23,159
Josh, how much of that
potion can you make?

526
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:25,220
I don't know. A buttload?

527
00:29:25,364 --> 00:29:26,730
That'll do.

528
00:29:29,835 --> 00:29:31,861
Bambi, what are you casting?

529
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:33,735
Tracking spell.

530
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:35,433
Then we'll know
exactly where to find

531
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:37,601
those Dave Grohl
wannabe bitches.

532
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:45,511
Got you. The FU
Fighters' encampment.

533
00:29:45,651 --> 00:29:47,620
Okay, guys, here you go.

534
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:51,218
(SIGHS) It's a
shame, isn't it, El?

535
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,486
(SIGHS) Utter shame.

536
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:57,292
I mean, I can't be the one to
sneak into the FU Fighters' base.

537
00:29:57,362 --> 00:30:00,093
Certainly not. You
don't sneak. Mmm-mmm.

538
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:02,464
And you can't be the
one to dump that potion

539
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:06,027
into whatever disgusting
stew they're cooking for dinner.

540
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:09,233
Sadly, no. My eminence is
too easy to spot from afar.

541
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:10,833
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

542
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:13,845
If only we had someone
they'd never seen before.

543
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:16,381

you, O Joshua of Yonkers.

545
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:25,148
Eternal glory.

546
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:27,854
You done?

547
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:29,289
I'm done.

548
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:30,789
Great.

549
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:38,529
Here's your overdue book.

550
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,606
Now, can you find me some
shit to help with my hands, please?

551
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:46,077
I will look for something to help
you with that in just a moment.

552
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:04,552
Are you okay?

553
00:31:11,837 --> 00:31:13,203
Uh, hello?

554
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:20,609
I asked you a question,
man. Are you okay?

555
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:22,045
No.

556
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:24,843
I can't control my...

557
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:25,916

(EXHALES HEAVILY)

566
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,275
The card was cursed.

567
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:01,376
A Modus Hex.

568
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:03,547
It forces you to perform
an action against your will.

569
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:05,199
Yeah, but that dude
killed himself, okay?

570
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:06,816
The hex didn't make him do that.

571
00:32:06,892 --> 00:32:08,383
His name was Howard.

572
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,588
And if it wasn't
for his bravery,

573
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:13,996
the hex would have forced him to
do something incredibly dangerous.

574
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:15,260
Open a door?

575
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:16,995
That isn't just any door.

576
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:18,661
Then what is it?

577
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,739
As a novice of The Order,
there are many secrets

578
00:32:20,806 --> 00:32:22,417
that will be imparted to
you when the time is right.

579
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:25,536
I just watched a man kill
himself. What's behind the door?

580
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:28,611
The Poison Room.

581
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:31,044
The what?

582
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:33,261
It's where we store books
too dangerous for the public.

583
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,982
I suspect Harriet's curse was
an attempt to steal its contents.

584
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:37,919
Wait. Howard kamikazed himself

585
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:40,049
'cause someone wanted
some banned books?

586
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:42,320
That's pretty fucked-up.

587
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:45,023
What is (WHISPERS) fucked-up

588
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:46,724
is that there is
knowledge out there

589
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,323
so dangerous we
need a Poison Room,

590
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,392
so it doesn't fall
into the wrong hands.

591
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:53,098
That is why Howard
sacrificed his life.

592
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:55,299
It's something all
Librarians would do.

593
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:56,841
So he had to die to keep someone

594
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:58,638
from getting their
hands on what?

595
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:01,145
Some crazy battle magic?

596
00:33:01,213 --> 00:33:02,790
There is knowledge
behind that door, Penny,

597
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:06,148
that could destroy
more than just people.

598
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:07,982
It could destroy worlds.

599
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:11,113
The Tesla Flexion has only been

600
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:13,624
successfully
employed once before.

601
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:16,389
Luckily, we're using
the original equipment,

602
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:18,726
left to Brakebills by
the man who invented it.

603
00:33:18,797 --> 00:33:20,129
Nikola Tesla?

604
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:22,133
No, Fred Flexion.

605
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:28,206
Okay, and it's only been
used once before because...

606
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:31,539
Three people died trying
to shut it down last time.

607
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,203
What's the tent for?

608
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:36,544
The Flexion is a fold
between two different realities.

609
00:33:36,615 --> 00:33:38,675
The tented area is
where they cross over.

610
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:42,448
Now, Ms. Wicker and I will
work together to cast the Flexion,

611
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:47,323
but if we hold it longer than
two minutes, we will all die.

612
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:49,122
Well, don't sugarcoat it.

613
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:50,759
Quentin.

614
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:55,791
Get the answers that
you need, and then get out.

615
00:33:57,002 --> 00:33:58,527
Understood?

616
00:33:59,271 --> 00:34:02,298
And try not to touch
anything in there.

617
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:04,840
Okay. Why?

618
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,283
Matter from different realities

619
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:09,371
occupying the same
space can create a paradox.

620
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:11,211
More like an explosion.

problems for the people

who'd find what's
left of our bodies.

623
00:34:17,122 --> 00:34:18,988
Touch nothing. Got it.

624
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,854
Dude, their shit was
seriously jacked up.

625
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:26,364
Their K-holes
were inside K-holes.

626
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:28,229

00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:32,596

the foreseeable future.

it would be weird.

00:38:53,431 --> 00:38:55,332
We can't hold it
much longer, Quentin.

700
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,426
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

701
00:38:58,803 --> 00:39:00,465
Sorry for what?

702
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,565
When you died,

703
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:06,301
we weren't in a good place.

704
00:39:08,413 --> 00:39:14,876
We were fighting, and I
was just too proud to let it go.

705
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:20,481
No. I don't know what
that other Quentin thought,

706
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:23,187
but, in this world, I love you.

707
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,288
Okay.

708
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:29,192
No matter what, I love you.

709
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:32,536

(TESLA FLEXION POWERS DOWN)

711
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:57,656
Yeah, but Harriet didn't know
the guy was gonna kill himself.

712
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:59,027
Are you defending her?

713
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:02,556
No, I'm just saying that
she's not totally wrong.

714
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,302
The Librarians are
hiding some things.

715
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:07,032
Yeah, things that are
insanely dangerous!

716
00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:08,630
They could have good reasons.

717
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:11,505
Okay, and who the fuck are
Librarians to decide who gets what?

718
00:40:11,576 --> 00:40:13,954
Do you really want every hedge
witch with a grudge and a bad idea

719
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:15,947
to get a nuclear bomb?

720
00:40:16,481 --> 00:40:17,744
Fuck you.

721
00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:20,309
I'm not talking about you.

722
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,220
Yeah, you are.

723
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:25,747
No, I'm not.

724
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:28,818
I think we might be too late.

725
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:30,885
Motherfucker.

726
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:34,860
No.

727
00:40:35,366 --> 00:40:37,597
No. No.

(SIGHS)

729
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:55,615
PENNY: <i>The Ars Deicidium?</i>

730
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:59,157
The art of killing gods.

731

(SOBBING) Eliot. Oh, thank God.

732
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:06,491
I don't know what to do.

733
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:08,192
Margo made a
deal with the Fairies,

734
00:41:08,266 --> 00:41:09,825
and they're coming for our baby.

735
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:15,197
A deal's a deal.

736
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:16,373
(SOBBING)

737
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,873
You've been staring
at that page for an hour.

738
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:27,617
Uh...

739
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:33,188
I just keep seeing her face.

740
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,757
I get that you're hurting.

741
00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:45,734
I don't know what to say
to make you feel better.

742
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:49,706
It's okay. I don't really
want to feel better anyway.

743
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:06,652
Maybe I'd better not
show you this, then.

744
00:42:07,692 --> 00:42:10,127
I think I figured out
what an Ancient One is.

745
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:18,393
No fucking way.
