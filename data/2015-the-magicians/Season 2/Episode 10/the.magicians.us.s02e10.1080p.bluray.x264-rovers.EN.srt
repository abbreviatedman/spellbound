1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,514
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:02,634 --> 00:00:05,028
This contract initiates our
services in exchange for...

3
00:00:05,148 --> 00:00:07,150
Unlimited manual and magical labor?

4
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:09,136
You signed that insane contract?

5
00:00:09,171 --> 00:00:11,591
- Yeah, it's okay.
- How the hell is that okay?

6
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:12,921
Because I get magic back.

7
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:14,419
Did you do this for me?

8
00:00:14,454 --> 00:00:17,655
I'm Bayler, a proud soldier
of Fillorians United.

9
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:19,357
We will not rest until

10
00:00:19,392 --> 00:00:21,359
a Fillorian sits upon the throne.

11
00:00:21,394 --> 00:00:23,428
The fairies can bring back
The Wellspring?

12
00:00:23,463 --> 00:00:25,496
- They can.
- And in return?

13
00:00:25,532 --> 00:00:27,331
A royal child of Whitespire.

14
00:00:27,367 --> 00:00:28,733
We're getting married.

15
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:31,402
Apparently all monarchs are
entitled to one of each:

16
00:00:31,438 --> 00:00:32,831
a wife and a husband.

17
00:00:32,951 --> 00:00:35,239
Alice, I hope you meant it.

18
00:00:35,275 --> 00:00:39,110
I hope you just go
and do beautiful magic.

19
00:00:39,145 --> 00:00:40,545
Quentin says go free.

20
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,214
You fed him to Reynard.

21
00:00:43,249 --> 00:00:44,415
He knew how to survive.

22
00:00:44,451 --> 00:00:46,584
Yeah, by doing what you want.

23
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:49,353
That's all you see anymore,
is what you want.

24
00:00:49,389 --> 00:00:51,622
You don't feel anymore, Julia...

25
00:00:51,658 --> 00:00:53,391
not the way a human does.

26
00:00:53,426 --> 00:00:54,592
Do you remember the gift

27
00:00:54,627 --> 00:00:56,194
that Jane was given in the book

28
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:57,762
"The Girl Who Told Time"?

29
00:00:57,797 --> 00:00:59,897
Ember gave her the ability
to fuck with time

30
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:01,432
on a cosmic scale.

31
00:01:01,468 --> 00:01:03,701
Jane used it to create a time loop.

32
00:01:03,736 --> 00:01:07,305
In each loop, Jane alters something

33
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:08,706
to see if it'll change the outcome.

34
00:01:08,741 --> 00:01:09,807
What's different this time?

35
00:01:09,843 --> 00:01:10,843
I was at Brakebills.

36
00:01:10,877 --> 00:01:11,917
You were supposed to be.

37
00:01:11,945 --> 00:01:14,445
Or you were, like, 39 times.

38
00:01:14,481 --> 00:01:15,847
You were the thing they changed.

39
00:01:23,389 --> 00:01:26,190
Very impressive, Ms. Wicker.

40
00:01:26,226 --> 00:01:27,425
Let me do it again.

41
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,760
I was wondering what would happen

42
00:01:29,796 --> 00:01:33,731
if I connected the sequence with
Atsuko's Spectral Refraction.

43
00:01:33,766 --> 00:01:34,832
All right.

44
00:01:51,751 --> 00:01:54,418
That is a second year spell.

45
00:01:54,454 --> 00:01:55,753
I...I read ahead.

46
00:01:55,788 --> 00:01:57,922
More than that, you...

47
00:01:57,957 --> 00:02:00,758
you understood the theory
behind the spell, and...

48
00:02:00,793 --> 00:02:03,394
and you reshaped it.

49
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:06,197
Your discipline is meta-composition.

50
00:02:06,232 --> 00:02:08,533
You are a Knowledge student.

51
00:02:08,568 --> 00:02:10,935
- Knowledge?
- Part psychic, part physical.

52
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,571
There really is no branch
it doesn't touch on.

53
00:02:13,606 --> 00:02:15,907
The short version: you are drawn,

54
00:02:15,942 --> 00:02:19,477
mind and body,
to the discovery of magic.

55
00:02:19,512 --> 00:02:22,246
Is it true that they...
um, well that we...

56
00:02:22,282 --> 00:02:24,348
live in the attic above the Library?

57
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:27,818
I assure you it is much more
luxurious than it sounds.

58
00:02:27,854 --> 00:02:29,787
No, I mean, it sounds
like bliss, actually.

59
00:02:29,822 --> 00:02:32,490
I enjoyed it.

60
00:02:32,525 --> 00:02:33,691
You were a Knowledge student?

61
00:02:33,726 --> 00:02:35,259
I am a Knowledge student.

62
00:02:35,295 --> 00:02:37,528
It doesn't end with your degree.

63
00:02:37,564 --> 00:02:39,297
You have a rare gift, Julia,

64
00:02:39,332 --> 00:02:43,534
and I must admit I'm envious
of the many rich discoveries

65
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:45,403
that you have ahead of you.

66
00:02:45,438 --> 00:02:46,704
Welcome.

67
00:02:48,341 --> 00:02:49,807
Thank you.

68
00:03:06,593 --> 00:03:08,893
You are free to go.

69
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,494
Why would you let me go?

70
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,830
Because, Ms. Wicker,

71
00:03:12,865 --> 00:03:14,599
you are not a student here,

72
00:03:14,634 --> 00:03:16,867
and I'm not running a jail.

73
00:03:16,903 --> 00:03:20,371
Kady locked me up for a good reason.

74
00:03:20,406 --> 00:03:22,573
I should feel terrible

75
00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:24,008
about what I did.

76
00:03:26,312 --> 00:03:28,879
But I don't.

77
00:03:28,915 --> 00:03:31,749
I just think it's terrible,

78
00:03:31,784 --> 00:03:35,419
and I think I would've never
done it if I were me.

79
00:03:35,455 --> 00:03:37,888
One thing I've learned
about you, Ms. Wicker,

80
00:03:37,924 --> 00:03:40,491
is that you are a searcher.

81
00:03:43,363 --> 00:03:45,029
You don't know me.

82
00:03:45,064 --> 00:03:48,599
39 times I've known you.

83
00:03:48,635 --> 00:03:51,469
Which is why I trust that
you'll put aside your fear

84
00:03:51,504 --> 00:03:53,471
and self-pity

85
00:03:53,506 --> 00:03:56,540
and look for the answers
that can save you.

86
00:04:01,414 --> 00:04:03,581
Why am I the only one
worried about this wedding?

87
00:04:07,787 --> 00:04:10,388
Congratulations. You failed.

88
00:04:10,423 --> 00:04:13,057
Oh, hey, hey, um,

89
00:04:13,092 --> 00:04:14,592
King needs more wine.

90
00:04:14,627 --> 00:04:16,494
Of course, sire.

91
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:18,062
I feel bad; I forgot your name.

92
00:04:18,097 --> 00:04:20,064
It's Smedley, sire.

93
00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:21,932
Smedley. Thanks, Smedley.

94
00:04:21,968 --> 00:04:24,635
Hey. I'll take that.

95
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:26,904
Oh, no, wait, I'm... I'm not done.

96
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:29,707
I think you were.

97
00:04:29,742 --> 00:04:30,975
Not cool.

98
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,577
Those grapes died for nothing now.

99
00:04:33,613 --> 00:04:35,980
Those grapes died so you might live.

100
00:04:36,015 --> 00:04:37,615
Because if you keep drinking,

101
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,917
I will seriously cut a bitch.

102
00:04:39,952 --> 00:04:41,819
You never yell at Eliot for being drunk.

103
00:04:41,854 --> 00:04:43,521
Because Eliot's fun.

104
00:04:43,556 --> 00:04:46,324
You're depressing.
It's been three months.

105
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:49,493
Technically, it's only been
a couple of days on Earth, so...

106
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:51,429
Three months on Fillory

107
00:04:51,464 --> 00:04:53,864
of emo Quentin.

108
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,766
Not my favorite Quentin.

109
00:04:55,802 --> 00:04:58,803
I didn't know that you liked
any of the Quentins.

110
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:02,606
I had to let Alice go.

111
00:05:02,642 --> 00:05:05,109
I'm...

112
00:05:05,144 --> 00:05:06,677
sympathetic.

113
00:05:06,713 --> 00:05:07,878
Okay?

114
00:05:07,914 --> 00:05:09,580
But meanwhile,

115
00:05:09,615 --> 00:05:12,683
Groomzilla is suddenly my full-time job.

116
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:13,984
I need your help.

117
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,721
Bambi! This is an emergency.

118
00:05:16,756 --> 00:05:18,456
These are all wrong.

119
00:05:18,491 --> 00:05:20,825
You're banished forever. Thank you.

120
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,894
He's just so mean when he needs things.

121
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:26,564
Eliot needs a friend, asshole.

122
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:28,566
It's your turn to be button boy

123
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:30,868
and run his random Earth errands.

124
00:05:30,903 --> 00:05:32,937
I need a free moment

125
00:05:32,972 --> 00:05:35,606
to rub one out in a hot bath

126
00:05:35,641 --> 00:05:38,476
before I fucking kill someone.

127
00:05:38,511 --> 00:05:40,878
That someone being you.

128
00:05:42,148 --> 00:05:43,647
Message received.

129
00:05:43,683 --> 00:05:47,051
And get your feet off my throne.

130
00:05:51,457 --> 00:05:53,057
This is insane. Why the fuck would Fogg

131
00:05:53,092 --> 00:05:54,092
let Julia go?

132
00:05:54,127 --> 00:05:55,126
Haven't you ever noticed?

133
00:05:55,161 --> 00:05:56,827
Fogg isn't that helpful.

134
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,896
Plus, you knew he couldn't
keep her in there forever.

135
00:05:58,931 --> 00:06:00,998
Yeah, well, I thought
she'd at least be in there

136
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:03,567
long enough for us to figure out
what to do next.

137
00:06:03,603 --> 00:06:04,935
Where are you going?

138
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:08,205
I still have Reynard to deal with.

139
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:10,441
And I really don't want
to run into Julia.

140
00:06:10,476 --> 00:06:11,675
Fine, let's go.

141
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,977
Okay, no.

142
00:06:13,012 --> 00:06:15,880
Penny, Reynard is my problem.

143
00:06:15,915 --> 00:06:17,181
We've been over this.

144
00:06:17,216 --> 00:06:19,984
Rapist monsters are a universal problem.

145
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:21,719
And the last time you tried to help,

146
00:06:21,754 --> 00:06:25,122
you signed, like, a billion-year
contract with The Order.

147
00:06:26,726 --> 00:06:28,025
When does that start, by the way?

148
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,794
Not today.

149
00:06:29,829 --> 00:06:32,129
Takes 'em four weeks to process
a book request.

150
00:06:32,165 --> 00:06:33,798
Let's go.

151
00:06:42,742 --> 00:06:44,975
Uh...

152
00:06:45,011 --> 00:06:47,678
where are we?

153
00:06:47,713 --> 00:06:50,014
Penny, we've processed your application

154
00:06:50,049 --> 00:06:53,320
and would like to formally
welcome you to The Order.

155
00:06:54,754 --> 00:06:56,734
Shit.

156
00:07:06,966 --> 00:07:09,767
Congratulations!

157
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,975
Kady, we've allowed you here
to assist in Penny's transition.

158
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,810
But I'm afraid I'm not allowed
to discuss the business

159
00:07:19,845 --> 00:07:21,145
of The Order with you present.

160
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,147
Yeah, fine. I'll fuck off.

161
00:07:23,182 --> 00:07:25,182
Uh, no eating or drinking in the Library

162
00:07:25,217 --> 00:07:26,417
except where posted.

163
00:07:27,954 --> 00:07:29,987
Now, Penny,

164
00:07:30,022 --> 00:07:33,290
we need to go over some
of your... obligations.

165
00:07:36,028 --> 00:07:37,261
I just don't get it.

166
00:07:37,296 --> 00:07:39,229
I mean, I did head off a famine...

167
00:07:39,265 --> 00:07:41,332
personally staved off a war.

168
00:07:41,367 --> 00:07:43,167
Not to mention, The Wellspring
is back online.

169
00:07:43,202 --> 00:07:45,803
And yet the people don't like me
any more than they did.

170
00:07:45,838 --> 00:07:48,205
How can you possibly know
what they actually think of you?

171
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,108
There's this Earth magician,
Nate Silver.

172
00:07:51,143 --> 00:07:54,111
I adapted one of his polling spells.

173
00:07:54,146 --> 00:07:57,414
Right now, my approval rating is at 26%,

174
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,383
which is not good, Bayler.

175
00:07:59,418 --> 00:08:00,784
Not at all.

176
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,420
But still, why ask me?

177
00:08:03,456 --> 00:08:06,123
Mmm, I don't know.

178
00:08:06,158 --> 00:08:08,425
I figured you might know
why they hate me so much,

179
00:08:08,461 --> 00:08:10,427
seeing as you tried to murder me.

180
00:08:10,463 --> 00:08:13,130
Okay, that was before I got to know you.

181
00:08:13,165 --> 00:08:17,067
And before you introduced me
to this Earth delicacy...

182
00:08:17,103 --> 00:08:18,435
na-chos.

183
00:08:18,471 --> 00:08:21,905
Wait till you try your first margarita.

184
00:08:21,941 --> 00:08:24,041
Mmm.

185
00:08:24,076 --> 00:08:25,943
Listen...

186
00:08:25,978 --> 00:08:28,779
If you're really worried about
what the people think of you,

187
00:08:28,814 --> 00:08:30,014
let's talk about your wedding.

188
00:08:30,049 --> 00:08:32,182
Ugh. Can we not?

189
00:08:32,218 --> 00:08:33,717
Historically,

190
00:08:33,753 --> 00:08:36,754
a royal wedding is the perfect
time for a monarch

191
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:38,222
to make their appeal to the people.

192
00:08:38,257 --> 00:08:40,190
Idri prefers a private ceremony.

193
00:08:40,226 --> 00:08:42,159
But what if you went public?

194
00:08:42,194 --> 00:08:44,294
Might improve your polling.

195
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:50,200
One for $20, three for $50.

196
00:08:50,236 --> 00:08:53,170
Which gets you the highest?

197
00:08:53,205 --> 00:08:55,039
Highest?

198
00:08:55,074 --> 00:08:58,075
This is grown locally
from heirloom seed stock,

199
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:01,045
paired with the ideal pastry
for a curated drug experience.

200
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,413
This will make you levitate.

201
00:09:02,448 --> 00:09:04,848
This is like being hugged by a rainbow.

202
00:09:04,884 --> 00:09:07,151
This is like being blown by a rainbow.

203
00:09:07,186 --> 00:09:08,385
Do not mix these up.

204
00:09:08,421 --> 00:09:09,820
Yeah, I'll take six.

205
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:15,893
So the High King needs me?

206
00:09:15,928 --> 00:09:18,996
Yes, he asked for you specifically.

207
00:09:19,031 --> 00:09:20,764
A command performance.

208
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,367
Righteous.

209
00:09:23,402 --> 00:09:24,935
How are... how are you doing?

210
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,271
The last time I saw you, you weren't...

211
00:09:27,306 --> 00:09:29,206
doing so good.

212
00:09:29,241 --> 00:09:31,041
Whatever happened with the whole, uh...

213
00:09:31,077 --> 00:09:32,242
I let her go.

214
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:34,144
I'm fine.

215
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,979
I've been self-medicating, so...

216
00:09:36,015 --> 00:09:37,948
uh, they don't have Abilify in Fillory,

217
00:09:37,983 --> 00:09:40,317
but I have been improvising.

218
00:09:40,352 --> 00:09:44,321
Well, this is Dr. Josh's prescription.

219
00:09:44,356 --> 00:09:46,957
I mean, we don't have
to race off to Fillory

220
00:09:46,992 --> 00:09:49,326
right this second.

221
00:09:49,361 --> 00:09:50,994
We have a minute. What's it do?

222
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:54,031
Dude, lets you see into other worlds.

223
00:09:54,066 --> 00:09:55,265
It's rad.

224
00:10:03,843 --> 00:10:05,275
This is rad.

225
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:21,825
Is that you...

226
00:10:21,861 --> 00:10:24,461
Quentin?

227
00:10:24,497 --> 00:10:26,930
Um...

228
00:10:26,966 --> 00:10:29,867
you look familiar.

229
00:10:29,902 --> 00:10:33,003
Holy shit, Julia?

230
00:10:33,038 --> 00:10:35,038
Why do you look like a 12-year-old?

231
00:10:35,074 --> 00:10:37,007
Because I'm her Shade.

232
00:10:39,478 --> 00:10:42,546
Oh, Q, I'm so happy to see you again.

233
00:10:42,581 --> 00:10:44,381
I really, really missed you.

234
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:45,883
Her Shade?

235
00:10:45,918 --> 00:10:48,051
I thought that you were gone.

236
00:10:48,087 --> 00:10:49,386
I'm lost.

237
00:10:49,421 --> 00:10:51,321
I can't find my way home.

238
00:10:53,025 --> 00:10:54,825
This is getting less rad.

239
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,293
Please, Quentin.

240
00:10:56,328 --> 00:10:58,295
I've been looking for a way out,
and then...

241
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:01,098
suddenly I could see you.

242
00:11:01,133 --> 00:11:03,200
Yeah, you're in another world.

243
00:11:03,235 --> 00:11:04,700
Um...

244
00:11:04,821 --> 00:11:05,987
where are you?

245
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:07,747
I have no idea.

246
00:11:09,108 --> 00:11:10,374
I can't stay here.

247
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:11,608
Time is running out.

248
00:11:11,644 --> 00:11:13,577
- Can you help me?
- Yeah, I'll try.

249
00:11:13,612 --> 00:11:15,790
- H-how can I find you?
- I don't know.

250
00:11:15,815 --> 00:11:17,614
I don't even know how I got here.

251
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,283
Please, Quentin.

252
00:11:19,318 --> 00:11:21,418
I have to get back to Julia.

253
00:11:21,453 --> 00:11:23,620
You have to find me
before it's too late.

254
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,319
Holy shit, are we at war?

255
00:11:47,439 --> 00:11:48,874
I wish we were at war.

256
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:50,943
These are the place settings
for the wedding.

257
00:11:50,978 --> 00:11:52,711
Much more dangerous.

258
00:11:52,747 --> 00:11:54,513
How's Josh doing in the royal kitchens?

259
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:56,382
Uh...

260
00:11:56,417 --> 00:11:59,618
he's declared them "adequate."

261
00:11:59,653 --> 00:12:01,387
Eliot, I have to go back to Earth.

262
00:12:01,422 --> 00:12:02,621
Don't be ridiculous.

263
00:12:02,656 --> 00:12:04,590
You have far too much to do here.

264
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,225
I had a vision, okay?

265
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,962
A way that I can maybe help Julia.

266
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,599
I can't ignore it.

267
00:12:13,634 --> 00:12:14,967
Can't you?

268
00:12:15,002 --> 00:12:17,903
It was a motherfucking vision, El.

269
00:12:17,938 --> 00:12:19,505
Look, I don't know how else to say it.

270
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,939
I just... I feel like this
is something that I...

271
00:12:20,975 --> 00:12:22,674
I have to do right now.

272
00:12:25,646 --> 00:12:26,845
I can see that.

273
00:12:28,983 --> 00:12:31,483
Yeah.

274
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,387
If you miss my wedding, I will kill you.

275
00:12:35,423 --> 00:12:37,489
- Okay.
- Okay.

276
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,295
Hey, uh, can you help me
find some information?

277
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,530
Of course.

278
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:45,798
What are you looking for?

279
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,332
Well, say you have a...

280
00:12:47,368 --> 00:12:49,968
a being with an enormous
amount of power.

281
00:12:50,004 --> 00:12:53,038
I'm looking for how someone might...

282
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:54,807
you know, defeat them.

283
00:12:54,842 --> 00:12:56,508
How much power?

284
00:12:56,544 --> 00:12:58,944
Let's say... god-like?

285
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:00,612
So classical myths?

286
00:13:00,648 --> 00:13:04,283
No, more like a how-to manual.

287
00:13:04,318 --> 00:13:05,651
Let me check upstairs.

288
00:13:21,035 --> 00:13:22,534
So do we just wait?

289
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:30,742
Oh.

290
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:39,318
I'm afraid we don't have
any books available

291
00:13:39,353 --> 00:13:40,919
on that particular topic.

292
00:13:40,955 --> 00:13:45,090
There's nothing in the entire
Library of the Neitherlands

293
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,959
on killing any kind of god?

294
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,794
Have you considered that it
might not be strictly possible

295
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,629
to do so?

296
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:53,465
Didn't the Norse Gods kill
each other, like, all the time?

297
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:55,367
The Library is full of stories.

298
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:56,668
It happened.

299
00:13:56,704 --> 00:13:57,870
I know it has.

300
00:13:57,905 --> 00:14:00,005
In Fillory, The Beast killed Umber.

301
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,907
Sounds fascinating.

302
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,775
Unfortunately, there is no
written record

303
00:14:03,811 --> 00:14:06,979
of the type you seek regarding
the mechanics of such an event.

304
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:08,514
Terribly sorry.

305
00:14:18,659 --> 00:14:21,927
Struck out looking
for a god-murder spell.

306
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:24,596
It can't be that no one
in all of history ever...

307
00:14:24,632 --> 00:14:26,832
Well, apparently,
no one ever wrote it down.

308
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:29,801
Look, if a way exists,

309
00:14:29,837 --> 00:14:31,036
I'm finding it.

310
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:32,738
So what's up with your hands?

311
00:14:32,773 --> 00:14:35,040
They told me there are books to help me,

312
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:38,911
but I'd have to do the research
on my own time.

313
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:41,647
Seriously? What are you
supposed to do in the meantime?

314
00:14:41,682 --> 00:14:44,483
My job.

315
00:14:44,518 --> 00:14:46,685
Apparently, I track down overdue books,

316
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,622
and this one has been checked
out for over ten years.

317
00:14:50,658 --> 00:14:51,890
You got to be kidding.

318
00:14:51,926 --> 00:14:54,693
Since I still can't cast,

319
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:57,129
I thought you could help me out
with a little locator spell?

320
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:11,543
My King.

321
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:12,778
Hi, Fen.

322
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:15,881
Are you all right?

323
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:19,451
Yes, fine.
How go the wedding preparations?

324
00:15:19,486 --> 00:15:22,621
Oh... they're fine.

325
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:24,189
Is there anything I can help with?

326
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:31,063
Is that something that you'd
actually want to help with?

327
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:33,565
You're acting like you think
I'd disapprove of it.

328
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:37,102
Your husband is about to
welcome another husband

329
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:38,904
into his bed.

330
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:40,639
You're a king.

331
00:15:40,674 --> 00:15:42,474
Of course you will.

332
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:45,944
I gather a three-person marriage
isn't normal on Earth?

333
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:49,181
Not outside of Utah.

334
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:50,649
Or some websites.

335
00:15:50,684 --> 00:15:54,586
Those are cities made of pixels, right?

336
00:15:54,622 --> 00:15:55,921
Close.

337
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:59,024
My mission, so you understand it,

338
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:01,526
is to protect our growing family.

339
00:16:01,562 --> 00:16:03,929
Your marriage to Idri means
a stronger kingdom

340
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:05,697
to raise our child in.

341
00:16:05,733 --> 00:16:07,866
You are being way more
understanding about this

342
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:09,901
than I would be in your shoes.

343
00:16:09,937 --> 00:16:11,503
That's my job.

344
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:17,476
Look, I'm gonna go talk
to my royal chef.

345
00:16:17,511 --> 00:16:19,011
Care to join?

346
00:16:19,046 --> 00:16:20,112
Thanks.

347
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:22,714
I'm... not feeling good.

348
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,750
It's morning sickness.

349
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:03,622
Q, leave.

350
00:17:03,657 --> 00:17:04,657
I'm not going anywhere.

351
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:05,924
Just open the door.

352
00:17:07,895 --> 00:17:09,795
Fuck, I could've...

353
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:11,029
I could've killed you.

354
00:17:14,001 --> 00:17:17,002
You know, I never...
I never once stopped to ask

355
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:18,837
if I was doing the right thing.

356
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:23,809
And now it's all I ask.

357
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:28,814
If I did this,

358
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:30,849
would Q look at me like I'm evil?

359
00:17:35,723 --> 00:17:37,656
I can't...

360
00:17:37,691 --> 00:17:40,325
really feel any of it anymore.

361
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:44,129
I'm doing it from memory.

362
00:17:48,602 --> 00:17:50,569
I'm broken.

363
00:17:50,604 --> 00:17:52,904
And that makes me dangerous.

364
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,807
So you should go.

365
00:17:55,843 --> 00:17:58,343
Jules...

366
00:17:58,378 --> 00:18:00,679
I talked to your Shade.

367
00:18:04,785 --> 00:18:07,953
Wait, so you saw her in a...

368
00:18:07,988 --> 00:18:11,123
Yeah, uh, I mean,
there were drugs involved.

369
00:18:11,158 --> 00:18:13,024
But I... I know that it was real.

370
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:15,727
And she's still alive?

371
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:17,329
Yeah.

372
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:19,064
Well, I don't really know
if that term applies here,

373
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:20,632
but she's not gone.

374
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,670
So where is she?

375
00:18:25,706 --> 00:18:27,939
I don't know.

376
00:18:27,975 --> 00:18:29,841
But wherever she is,

377
00:18:29,877 --> 00:18:31,643
she wants us to find her.

378
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:37,816
- What is this?
- Culinary classic.

379
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:41,219
Oysters and pearls
from the French Laundry.

380
00:18:41,255 --> 00:18:43,255
I had to get Thomas Keller so wrecked

381
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,257
before he'd show me
the secret to that recipe.

382
00:18:50,697 --> 00:18:53,732
Mmm.

383
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:56,768
I just don't think
it's "Fillory" enough.

384
00:18:56,804 --> 00:18:59,938
But half of Fillory eats boiled mutton.

385
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:01,807
Let's introduce them to,
like, actual food.

386
00:19:01,842 --> 00:19:03,241
This is their world.

387
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:05,143
We have to meet them halfway,
don't you think?

388
00:19:05,179 --> 00:19:06,812
Well, if half your recipe is shit,

389
00:19:06,847 --> 00:19:08,280
it's all going to taste like shit.

390
00:19:08,315 --> 00:19:10,248
Okay, okay. Fine, fine.

391
00:19:10,284 --> 00:19:12,017
Forget the dish.

392
00:19:12,052 --> 00:19:15,220
Let's start with, "What do you
want people to feel

393
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:17,122
when they eat it?"

394
00:19:17,157 --> 00:19:19,825
I want everyone to like me.

395
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,726
Then let's just make this easy.

396
00:19:21,762 --> 00:19:23,995
I'll make a potion. Poof!

397
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,430
They'll like you!

398
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:27,866
- Donesies!
- I need this.

399
00:19:33,207 --> 00:19:34,673
There's nothing in here either.

400
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:36,007
Got to keep looking.

401
00:19:36,043 --> 00:19:38,877
So scratchy.

402
00:19:38,912 --> 00:19:40,912
Go away, Todd.

403
00:19:40,948 --> 00:19:43,315
Stuff about the afterlife
is super wonky.

404
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,817
It's too close to religion.

405
00:19:45,853 --> 00:19:48,854
It's... it's hard to figure out
what's not a flat-out lie.

406
00:19:48,889 --> 00:19:49,921
Right?

407
00:19:49,957 --> 00:19:52,791
Hey, is this place real?

408
00:19:54,962 --> 00:19:56,261
No.

409
00:19:58,832 --> 00:20:00,298
You're hungover, Todd.

410
00:20:01,735 --> 00:20:03,702
Look, I found a passage here.

411
00:20:03,737 --> 00:20:06,404
Sort of vague, but it mentions Shades.

412
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,173
One passage in a dozen books?

413
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:11,309
Oh, yeah. Yeah, Shades.

414
00:20:11,345 --> 00:20:12,477
I mean, something.

415
00:20:12,512 --> 00:20:14,012
Nobody talks about Shades.

416
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:15,046
There's got to be a reason.

417
00:20:15,082 --> 00:20:16,715
I know, right?

418
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,785
I mean, when Fogg talked
about 'em the other day,

419
00:20:20,821 --> 00:20:23,355
it was the first I heard about 'em.

420
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:27,125
What?

421
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:31,096
My work study job...
I type up Fogg's memoirs.

422
00:20:31,131 --> 00:20:34,032
I guess he has, like, a crazy book deal.

423
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,034
He's led a seriously weird life.

424
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:39,271
Did you know that he and Bob Ross

425
00:20:39,306 --> 00:20:42,374
had a dark artistic rivalry, and...

426
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:43,942
What did he say about Shades?

427
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:48,113
Something like he knew someone

428
00:20:48,148 --> 00:20:50,482
who was obsessed with them?

429
00:20:50,517 --> 00:20:53,451
I do know... or I suppose I knew

430
00:20:53,487 --> 00:20:55,921
someone who was interested in Shades...

431
00:20:55,956 --> 00:20:57,255
was.

432
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:59,824
Ah, it's rather confusing.

433
00:20:59,851 --> 00:21:02,928
- Confusing why?
- Because you know her too.

434
00:21:02,963 --> 00:21:04,296
It's Alice.

435
00:21:10,501 --> 00:21:12,969
Honestly, I don't think that
she knew anything about Shades.

436
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:14,005
No, of course not.

437
00:21:14,401 --> 00:21:15,901
That Alice didn't.

438
00:21:15,936 --> 00:21:17,569
This Alice is a different story.

439
00:21:17,604 --> 00:21:19,071
What do you mean "this" Alice?

440
00:21:19,106 --> 00:21:21,640
Do you recall the time loop
I told you about?

441
00:21:21,675 --> 00:21:23,508
The 39 lifetimes?

442
00:21:23,544 --> 00:21:25,377
No one remembers them except me.

443
00:21:25,412 --> 00:21:27,012
Yeah, of course. You knew another me.

444
00:21:27,047 --> 00:21:28,880
The Alice from the 23rd timeline

445
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,450
was the sole survivor of The Beast.

446
00:21:31,485 --> 00:21:34,553
She became obsessed with the afterlife,

447
00:21:34,588 --> 00:21:37,689
how to commune with lost souls,

448
00:21:37,724 --> 00:21:39,391
and Shades.

449
00:21:39,426 --> 00:21:42,961
Would she know where one would go?

450
00:21:42,996 --> 00:21:44,396
I don't know what she knew.

451
00:21:44,431 --> 00:21:45,931
She just talked about them a lot.

452
00:21:45,966 --> 00:21:48,633
She was different than your Alice.

453
00:21:48,669 --> 00:21:51,636
She was hurt... broken.

454
00:21:51,672 --> 00:21:53,038
We need to talk to her.

455
00:21:53,073 --> 00:21:55,474
Well, you can't. It's already happened.

456
00:21:55,509 --> 00:21:59,077
Essentially in another universe.

457
00:21:59,113 --> 00:22:02,581
It's gone.

458
00:22:02,616 --> 00:22:04,616
Well, what about a Tesla Flexion?

459
00:22:07,488 --> 00:22:09,721
What is it?

460
00:22:09,756 --> 00:22:11,857
It's how we could talk to her.

461
00:22:18,031 --> 00:22:19,631
Can I ask you a woman question?

462
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:22,534
Ugh. I barely understand women.

463
00:22:22,569 --> 00:22:24,035
I think my pregnant wife

464
00:22:24,071 --> 00:22:27,405
might be having weird
pregnant wife feelings.

465
00:22:27,441 --> 00:22:28,640
Ew.

466
00:22:28,675 --> 00:22:30,175
Definitely not my rice bowl.

467
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:34,646
She just seems like
her head is elsewhere

468
00:22:34,681 --> 00:22:35,947
all the time.

469
00:22:35,983 --> 00:22:36,948
What do you mean?

470
00:22:36,984 --> 00:22:38,550
Every time I run into her,

471
00:22:38,585 --> 00:22:40,652
I feel like I'm interrupting
a conversation.

472
00:22:40,687 --> 00:22:42,587
Except there's no one else there.

473
00:22:51,598 --> 00:22:54,132
What is it?

474
00:22:54,168 --> 00:22:56,635
Nothing.

475
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:58,537
I need some air.

476
00:23:07,047 --> 00:23:08,947
Fuzzbeat?

477
00:23:08,982 --> 00:23:10,549
It's, like, a website.

478
00:23:10,584 --> 00:23:12,817
They do serious news
and cat videos at the same time.

479
00:23:12,853 --> 00:23:14,486
That's fucking dumb.

480
00:23:14,521 --> 00:23:16,441
Well, it's where the tracking
spell said to go.

481
00:23:18,892 --> 00:23:20,659
We're looking for Harriet.

482
00:23:20,694 --> 00:23:22,194
And you are?

483
00:23:22,229 --> 00:23:24,062
Just tell we're from The Order.

484
00:23:24,097 --> 00:23:26,831
Is that the new Pilates place?

485
00:23:26,867 --> 00:23:28,500
- Yes.
- Sweet.

486
00:23:35,042 --> 00:23:37,142
That's a fucking unicorn in a tutu.

487
00:23:45,686 --> 00:23:47,552
We're here for the book.

488
00:23:47,588 --> 00:23:49,955
"Principles of Conjuring Elementals."

489
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:52,090
It's ten years overdue.

490
00:23:53,126 --> 00:23:54,693
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

491
00:23:54,728 --> 00:23:57,562
She's not casting.

492
00:23:57,598 --> 00:23:59,064
She's signing.

493
00:23:59,099 --> 00:24:01,066
Oh.

494
00:24:01,101 --> 00:24:02,767
Yeah, I... I don't...
I don't speak that.

495
00:24:02,803 --> 00:24:04,970
She said we don't look like librarians.

496
00:24:05,005 --> 00:24:07,539
All right, well, you know,

497
00:24:07,574 --> 00:24:09,074
tell her we're looking for the book.

498
00:24:11,111 --> 00:24:13,745
We need that book back.

499
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,946
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

500
00:24:14,982 --> 00:24:17,082
Your signing is terrible.

501
00:24:17,117 --> 00:24:20,919
Yeah, my signing's a little rusty.

502
00:24:36,837 --> 00:24:39,738
- What'd she say?
- Uh, don't worry about it.

503
00:24:41,842 --> 00:24:43,642
So what's your deal?

504
00:24:43,677 --> 00:24:48,079
You write listicles, and you do
magic in your spare time?

505
00:24:48,115 --> 00:24:49,147
No.

506
00:24:49,182 --> 00:24:51,116
This is my magic.

507
00:24:51,151 --> 00:24:52,817
What are you talking about?

508
00:24:52,853 --> 00:24:54,219
Your clickbait site?

509
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,026
Yeah, right.

510
00:25:01,061 --> 00:25:03,828
- What the fuck is she saying?
- Shh.

511
00:25:03,864 --> 00:25:05,230
See for yourself.

512
00:25:07,367 --> 00:25:10,835
"18 Pandas With Things
That Look Like Pandas"?

513
00:25:10,871 --> 00:25:12,637
Half of those don't
even look like pandas.

514
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:20,812
That's how to conjure dark matter!

515
00:25:20,847 --> 00:25:22,347
What did you do to the pandas?

516
00:25:22,382 --> 00:25:24,349
It's an encoded spell.

517
00:25:24,384 --> 00:25:25,784
All these articles are.

518
00:25:28,055 --> 00:25:29,754
Wait, wait, how about...

519
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,790
how about "Drunk Guys
Eating Kids' Vitamins"?

520
00:25:36,963 --> 00:25:38,963
No! Really?

521
00:25:38,999 --> 00:25:40,699
- Oh, my God, that's...
- Yeah, when you guys

522
00:25:40,734 --> 00:25:42,734
are done bonding, do you think
you could ask her

523
00:25:42,769 --> 00:25:44,169
for the book now, please?

524
00:25:44,204 --> 00:25:46,671
Relax, kid.

525
00:25:46,707 --> 00:25:48,873
I'll find it.

526
00:25:48,909 --> 00:25:49,909
Oh.

527
00:25:51,645 --> 00:25:52,944
Mm!

528
00:25:52,979 --> 00:25:54,045
Just give us a sec.

529
00:25:58,085 --> 00:26:01,386
So I don't get it. Why do all this?

530
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,163
You're not wrong.

531
00:26:14,434 --> 00:26:17,669
Well, I was looking
for the kind of knowledge

532
00:26:17,704 --> 00:26:19,237
the Library doesn't have.

533
00:26:20,841 --> 00:26:22,841
Oh, the usual... beauty tips, recipes,

534
00:26:22,876 --> 00:26:24,309
how to kill a trickster god.

535
00:26:32,686 --> 00:26:33,852
Ah.

536
00:26:47,667 --> 00:26:50,301
- Here you go.
- Finally.

537
00:26:50,337 --> 00:26:51,736
Let's go.

538
00:26:51,772 --> 00:26:53,738
- Have a nice day.
- Fuck off.

539
00:27:04,818 --> 00:27:06,251
Thank you.

540
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:20,806
Why am I staring at a plate
of half-eaten nachos?

541
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:23,469
A question I've asked myself
very often at 3:00 a.m.

542
00:27:23,589 --> 00:27:26,624
- So I was doing the dishes...
- You're supposed to be cooking.

543
00:27:26,744 --> 00:27:28,085
I know. I...

544
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,821
kind of roofied the dishwasher.

545
00:27:30,856 --> 00:27:34,058
Um, that is not okay.

546
00:27:34,093 --> 00:27:36,827
No, not "roofied" roofied.

547
00:27:36,862 --> 00:27:38,996
Uh, more like he loves everyone so much,

548
00:27:39,031 --> 00:27:40,197
he's catatonic.

549
00:27:40,232 --> 00:27:41,465
It was an accident.

550
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,435
I was testing the potion for you.

551
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:46,737
Might have made it a little too strong.

552
00:27:46,772 --> 00:27:48,272
Forget it. Doesn't matter.

553
00:27:48,307 --> 00:27:51,075
The point is, I found this.

554
00:27:56,215 --> 00:27:59,383
"Wedding day. Western gate unguarded.

555
00:27:59,418 --> 00:28:01,852
Bring gifts there."

556
00:28:01,887 --> 00:28:04,755
I'm assuming they're not talking
about actual gifts.

557
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,223
No.

558
00:28:06,258 --> 00:28:08,092
They're talking about
chopping our heads off.

559
00:28:08,127 --> 00:28:09,259
Ooh.

560
00:28:09,295 --> 00:28:12,029
That backgammon-playing prick.

561
00:28:12,064 --> 00:28:14,264
Ah! I was so stupid.

562
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,333
After all the hours I spent
down in the dungeon,

563
00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:18,302
I actually thought I'd won Bayler over.

564
00:28:18,337 --> 00:28:20,204
I thought I had rehabbed his soul.

565
00:28:20,239 --> 00:28:22,072
Oh, honey.

566
00:28:22,108 --> 00:28:25,909
We both know rehab is about more
than nachos and backgammon.

567
00:28:25,945 --> 00:28:27,144
Is it?

568
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:29,046
Is it, Margo?

569
00:28:29,081 --> 00:28:32,282
Wait, so you're upset because
the guy who tried to kill you

570
00:28:32,318 --> 00:28:34,785
is gonna try and kill you again?

571
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,020
I should've executed him.

572
00:28:36,055 --> 00:28:37,021
It's not like anybody likes me anyway.

573
00:28:37,056 --> 00:28:38,455
I'm down 5%.

574
00:28:38,491 --> 00:28:41,091
And now the Fu Fighters
are gonna red my wedding!

575
00:28:41,127 --> 00:28:42,326
No.

576
00:28:42,361 --> 00:28:44,361
Okay? We won't let that happen.

577
00:28:45,531 --> 00:28:47,264
Josh, where's that dishwasher?

578
00:28:47,299 --> 00:28:48,265
Still in the armoire.

579
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,167
Why is he in the armoire?

580
00:28:50,202 --> 00:28:52,302
'Cause I'm not good in a crisis, okay?

581
00:28:52,338 --> 00:28:55,305
How were you ever a drug dealer?

582
00:28:57,009 --> 00:29:00,244
Look, that note was meant
for the dishwasher.

583
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:02,813
He's probably been passing
messages to the Fu Fighters

584
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,748
this whole time, so here's what we do.

585
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,350
We help him sober up, and then...

586
00:29:06,385 --> 00:29:08,118
We execute him.

587
00:29:08,154 --> 00:29:09,553
No.

588
00:29:09,588 --> 00:29:12,356
But it means so much to me
that you want to.

589
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:16,226
We put the note back
into the dirty dishes.

590
00:29:16,262 --> 00:29:19,830
We let him find it and take it
back to the Fu Fighters' base.

591
00:29:19,865 --> 00:29:21,031
Josh?

592
00:29:21,067 --> 00:29:22,833
How much of that potion can you make?

593
00:29:22,868 --> 00:29:24,968
I...I don't know. A buttload?

594
00:29:25,004 --> 00:29:26,203
That'll do.

595
00:29:29,508 --> 00:29:31,475
Bambi, what are you casting?

596
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:33,510
Tracking spell.

597
00:29:33,546 --> 00:29:35,212
Then we'll know exactly where to find

598
00:29:35,247 --> 00:29:37,448
those Dave Grohl-wannabe bitches.

599
00:29:42,321 --> 00:29:43,487
Gotcha.

600
00:29:43,522 --> 00:29:45,522
The Fu Fighters' encampment.

601
00:29:45,558 --> 00:29:47,591
Okay, guys, here you go.

602
00:29:47,626 --> 00:29:51,261
Aw, it's a shame, isn't it, El?

603
00:29:51,297 --> 00:29:53,831
Utter shame.

604
00:29:53,866 --> 00:29:55,065
I mean, I can't be the one

605
00:29:55,101 --> 00:29:57,301
to sneak into the Fu Fighters' base.

606
00:29:57,336 --> 00:29:58,869
Certainly not. You don't sneak.

607
00:29:58,904 --> 00:30:00,237
Mm-mm.

608
00:30:00,272 --> 00:30:02,172
And you can't be the one
to dump that potion

609
00:30:02,208 --> 00:30:05,876
into whatever disgusting stew
they're cooking for dinner.

610
00:30:05,911 --> 00:30:07,144
Sadly, no.

611
00:30:07,179 --> 00:30:09,413
My eminence is too easy
to spot from afar.

612
00:30:09,448 --> 00:30:11,048
Hmm.

613
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:14,051
If only we had someone
they'd never seen...

614
00:30:14,086 --> 00:30:17,621
Guys, stop the bit. I'll go.

615
00:30:17,656 --> 00:30:22,593
Eternal glory awaits you,
O Joshua of Yonkers.

616
00:30:22,628 --> 00:30:26,296
Eternal glory.

617
00:30:26,332 --> 00:30:27,531
You done?

618
00:30:27,566 --> 00:30:29,366
I'm done.

619
00:30:29,401 --> 00:30:30,601
Great.

620
00:30:36,408 --> 00:30:38,509
Here's your overdue book.

621
00:30:38,544 --> 00:30:41,512
Now can you find me some shit
to help with my hands, please?

622
00:30:41,547 --> 00:30:44,148
I will look for some thing

623
00:30:44,183 --> 00:30:46,150
to help you with that in just a moment.

624
00:31:02,568 --> 00:31:04,401
Are you okay?

625
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,076
Uh, hello?

626
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:19,616
Uh, I asked you a question, man.

627
00:31:19,652 --> 00:31:21,385
- Are you okay?
- No!

628
00:31:23,022 --> 00:31:24,955
I can't control my...

629
00:31:25,138 --> 00:31:26,338
look out!

630
00:31:31,964 --> 00:31:33,497
No!

631
00:31:35,601 --> 00:31:38,798
I can't... stop!

632
00:31:58,871 --> 00:32:01,573
The card was cursed. A Modus Hex.

633
00:32:01,601 --> 00:32:03,634
It forces you to perform
an action against your will.

634
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,236
Yeah, but that dude killed himself.

635
00:32:05,271 --> 00:32:06,804
Okay? The hex didn't make him do that.

636
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,373
His name was Howard.

637
00:32:08,408 --> 00:32:10,575
And if it wasn't for his bravery,

638
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:12,176
the hex would have forced him
to do something

639
00:32:12,212 --> 00:32:13,678
incredibly dangerous.

640
00:32:13,713 --> 00:32:15,279
Open a door?

641
00:32:15,315 --> 00:32:16,748
It isn't just any door.

642
00:32:16,783 --> 00:32:18,716
Then what is it?

643
00:32:18,752 --> 00:32:20,685
As a novice of The Order,
there are many secrets

644
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,420
that will be imparted to you
when the time is right.

645
00:32:22,455 --> 00:32:23,621
I just watched a man kill himself!

646
00:32:23,656 --> 00:32:24,856
What's behind the door?

647
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,360
The Poison Room.

648
00:32:29,396 --> 00:32:31,195
The what?

649
00:32:31,231 --> 00:32:33,297
It's where we store books
too dangerous for the public.

650
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:36,200
I suspect Harriet's curse was an
attempt to steal its contents.

651
00:32:36,236 --> 00:32:37,835
Wait, Howard kamikazed himself

652
00:32:37,871 --> 00:32:40,204
'cause someone wanted some banned books?

653
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,407
That's pretty fucked up!

654
00:32:42,442 --> 00:32:44,075
What is...

655
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:46,778
fucked up is that there
is knowledge out there

656
00:32:46,813 --> 00:32:48,346
so dangerous we need a Poison Room

657
00:32:48,381 --> 00:32:49,814
so it doesn't fall into the wrong hands.

658
00:32:49,849 --> 00:32:53,351
That is why Howard sacrificed his life.

659
00:32:53,386 --> 00:32:55,286
It's something all Librarians would do.

660
00:32:55,321 --> 00:32:57,221
So he had to die to keep
someone from getting

661
00:32:57,257 --> 00:32:59,223
their hands on what?

662
00:32:59,259 --> 00:33:01,125
Some crazy battle magic?

663
00:33:01,161 --> 00:33:02,860
There is knowledge
behind that door, Penny,

664
00:33:02,896 --> 00:33:06,264
that could destroy more
than just people.

665
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:09,567
It could destroy worlds.

666
00:33:09,602 --> 00:33:12,203
The Tesla Flexion has only
been successfully employed

667
00:33:12,238 --> 00:33:13,638
once before.

668
00:33:13,673 --> 00:33:16,441
Luckily, we're using
the original equipment,

669
00:33:16,476 --> 00:33:18,743
left to Brakebills by
the man who invented it.

670
00:33:18,778 --> 00:33:20,178
Nikola Tesla?

671
00:33:20,213 --> 00:33:22,280
No, Fred Flexion.

672
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,883
Okay.

673
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,453
And it's only been used
once before because...

674
00:33:28,488 --> 00:33:31,389
Three people died trying
to shut it down last time.

675
00:33:31,424 --> 00:33:33,157
What's the tent for?

676
00:33:33,193 --> 00:33:36,360
The Flexion is a fold between
two different realities.

677
00:33:36,396 --> 00:33:38,696
The tented area is where
they cross over.

678
00:33:38,731 --> 00:33:40,865
Now, Ms. Wicker and I will work together

679
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,300
to cast the Flexion,

680
00:33:42,335 --> 00:33:44,469
but if we hold it longer
than two minutes,

681
00:33:44,504 --> 00:33:46,771
we will all die.

682
00:33:46,806 --> 00:33:48,806
Well, don't sugarcoat it.

683
00:33:48,842 --> 00:33:50,508
Quentin...

684
00:33:53,179 --> 00:33:54,645
Get the answers that you need,

685
00:33:54,681 --> 00:33:56,814
and then get out.

686
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:59,183
Understood?

687
00:33:59,219 --> 00:34:02,687
And try not to touch anything in there.

688
00:34:02,722 --> 00:34:04,889
Okay. Why?

689
00:34:04,924 --> 00:34:06,290
Matter from different realities

690
00:34:06,326 --> 00:34:07,725
occupying the same space

691
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,926
can create a paradox.

692
00:34:08,962 --> 00:34:11,729
More like an explosion.

693
00:34:11,764 --> 00:34:13,931
As well a mess of problems
for the people who'd find

694
00:34:13,967 --> 00:34:16,667
what's left of our bodies.

695
00:34:16,703 --> 00:34:18,302
Touch nothing.

696
00:34:18,338 --> 00:34:19,804
Got it.

697
00:34:21,741 --> 00:34:23,808
Dude, their shit was
seriously jacked up.

698
00:34:23,843 --> 00:34:26,344
Their K-holes were inside K-holes.

699
00:34:26,379 --> 00:34:28,279
Does that even make sense?

700
00:34:28,314 --> 00:34:29,814
I'm just saying, the Fu Fighters

701
00:34:29,849 --> 00:34:32,850
are out of "comish"
for the foreseeable future.

702
00:34:32,886 --> 00:34:34,752
Your wedding may proceed apace, sire.

703
00:34:34,787 --> 00:34:39,390
And you, good sir, may shave
any nymph in the kingdom.

704
00:34:39,425 --> 00:34:42,493
- Like right now?
- Like right now.

705
00:34:42,529 --> 00:34:45,496
You are my once and future king.

706
00:34:49,836 --> 00:34:51,636
Just floating this:

707
00:34:51,671 --> 00:34:54,839
would it be weird if I fucked Josh?

708
00:34:54,874 --> 00:34:57,441
I certainly hope it would be weird.

709
00:34:59,879 --> 00:35:02,580
To my quick-thinking Bambi,

710
00:35:02,615 --> 00:35:04,582
who saved the day again.

711
00:35:07,587 --> 00:35:08,953
Speaking of saving the day,

712
00:35:08,988 --> 00:35:12,390
did you ever manage to talk to Fen?

713
00:35:12,425 --> 00:35:15,259
Um, yeah.

714
00:35:15,295 --> 00:35:16,460
She's fine.

715
00:35:16,496 --> 00:35:17,595
Good.

716
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,829
That's a relief.

717
00:35:20,733 --> 00:35:24,001
Fen? Fen!

718
00:35:30,877 --> 00:35:33,578
I want to talk to you about
the terms of our deal.

719
00:35:40,753 --> 00:35:42,687
Oh, shit.

720
00:35:42,722 --> 00:35:44,755
- Shit, shit...
- You saw it?

721
00:35:44,791 --> 00:35:46,791
You saw it too.

722
00:35:46,826 --> 00:35:47,792
Fen!

723
00:35:47,827 --> 00:35:49,760
I'm not going mad.

724
00:35:49,796 --> 00:35:53,030
Well...

725
00:35:53,066 --> 00:35:55,299
no.

726
00:35:55,335 --> 00:35:56,968
You're not.

727
00:35:57,003 --> 00:35:59,804
It was a fairy, okay?

728
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,906
Look, the day The Wellspring failed,

729
00:36:01,941 --> 00:36:04,041
I made a deal to save Eliot's life.

730
00:36:04,077 --> 00:36:05,543
You did, too.

731
00:36:05,578 --> 00:36:07,378
I don't understand.

732
00:36:07,413 --> 00:36:09,614
You agreed to do whatever
it took to save him.

733
00:36:09,649 --> 00:36:10,781
But I didn't.

734
00:36:10,817 --> 00:36:13,384
Well, you did.

735
00:36:13,419 --> 00:36:14,652
What do they want?

736
00:36:16,489 --> 00:36:18,055
Your baby.

737
00:36:18,091 --> 00:36:19,957
- What?
- Fen...

738
00:36:19,993 --> 00:36:21,826
I can stop this.

739
00:36:21,861 --> 00:36:23,961
You better fix this, because I
will not let them

740
00:36:23,997 --> 00:36:25,563
take my child.

741
00:36:29,636 --> 00:36:32,303
Fuck.

742
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:20,518
Quentin?

743
00:37:20,553 --> 00:37:21,585
Is that you?

744
00:37:21,621 --> 00:37:22,853
You're in a Tesla Flexion.

745
00:37:22,889 --> 00:37:24,922
I'm from another timeline.

746
00:37:24,957 --> 00:37:26,490
We only have two minutes.

747
00:37:26,526 --> 00:37:28,526
I need you to tell me
everything you know

748
00:37:28,561 --> 00:37:29,994
about Shades.

749
00:37:30,029 --> 00:37:31,762
It is you.

750
00:37:31,798 --> 00:37:33,531
Another you... you're alive.

751
00:37:33,566 --> 00:37:36,534
No, stop. We can't touch.

752
00:37:36,569 --> 00:37:37,902
I'm sorry. We have to go fast.

753
00:37:37,937 --> 00:37:39,737
I understand.

754
00:37:39,772 --> 00:37:41,639
Um...

755
00:37:41,674 --> 00:37:42,773
I'll tell you everything I know.

756
00:37:42,809 --> 00:37:44,675
It's just...

757
00:37:44,711 --> 00:37:46,577
I thought I'd never see you again.

758
00:37:46,612 --> 00:37:49,580
The Beast, he... he tore you apart

759
00:37:49,615 --> 00:37:51,615
piece by piece, but not just your body,

760
00:37:51,651 --> 00:37:53,551
but your... your Shade, everything.

761
00:37:53,586 --> 00:37:55,152
My Shade. Do you know where it went?

762
00:37:55,188 --> 00:37:58,122
I searched everywhere for it.

763
00:37:58,157 --> 00:38:00,424
You can't rest in peace without it.

764
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:03,461
But there are no books on how to do...

765
00:38:03,496 --> 00:38:05,796
so I traveled the world in
search of anyone, anything,

766
00:38:05,832 --> 00:38:06,997
that could help me.

767
00:38:07,033 --> 00:38:09,500
What did you learn?

768
00:38:09,535 --> 00:38:12,570
Shades go to The Underworld.

769
00:38:12,605 --> 00:38:13,771
There's an Underworld?

770
00:38:13,806 --> 00:38:15,639
It's only accessible to the dead.

771
00:38:15,675 --> 00:38:17,575
But there's a catch.

772
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:19,810
Alice, what happened to your hand?

773
00:38:19,846 --> 00:38:21,645
Doesn't matter.

774
00:38:21,681 --> 00:38:24,982
It's the least I gave up to learn this.

775
00:38:28,554 --> 00:38:30,488
The living can access The Underworld

776
00:38:30,523 --> 00:38:31,723
with the help of a Gatekeeper.

777
00:38:31,758 --> 00:38:33,691
- A Gatekeeper?
- An ancient one.

778
00:38:33,726 --> 00:38:35,960
A being older than the world itself.

779
00:38:35,995 --> 00:38:38,796
Okay, how do you find one of those?

780
00:38:38,831 --> 00:38:40,965
I don't know.

781
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,101
I'm still looking.

782
00:38:48,941 --> 00:38:50,875
- I have to go.
- Please, please...

783
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,209
just one more thing.

784
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,146
We can't hold it much longer, Quentin!

785
00:38:55,181 --> 00:38:58,082
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

786
00:38:58,117 --> 00:39:00,117
Sorry for what?

787
00:39:01,854 --> 00:39:04,588
When you died,

788
00:39:04,624 --> 00:39:06,524
we weren't in a good place.

789
00:39:08,127 --> 00:39:10,895
We were... we were fighting,

790
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:15,065
and I was too proud to... to let it go.

791
00:39:18,738 --> 00:39:20,504
I don't know what that
other Quentin felt,

792
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:23,707
but in this world, I love you.

793
00:39:23,743 --> 00:39:25,476
Okay.

794
00:39:25,511 --> 00:39:28,012
No matter what.

795
00:39:28,047 --> 00:39:29,780
I love you.

796
00:39:55,042 --> 00:39:57,543
Yeah, but Harriet didn't know
the guy was gonna kill himself.

797
00:39:57,621 --> 00:39:59,045
Are you defending her?

798
00:39:59,081 --> 00:40:02,588
No, I'm just saying that
she's not totally wrong.

799
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,292
The Librarians are hiding something.

800
00:40:05,327 --> 00:40:07,171
Yeah, things that are
insanely dangerous.

801
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,762
They could have good reasons.

802
00:40:08,797 --> 00:40:09,963
Okay, and who the fuck
are librarians to decide

803
00:40:09,999 --> 00:40:11,698
who gets what?

804
00:40:11,734 --> 00:40:13,567
Do you really want every
Hedge Witch with a grudge

805
00:40:13,602 --> 00:40:16,069
and a bad idea to get a nuclear bomb?

806
00:40:16,105 --> 00:40:18,105
Fuck you.

807
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,073
I'm not talking about you.

808
00:40:20,109 --> 00:40:23,110
Yeah, you are.

809
00:40:23,145 --> 00:40:26,546
No, I'm not.

810
00:40:26,582 --> 00:40:27,948
Think we might be too late.

811
00:40:27,983 --> 00:40:30,584
Motherfucker.

812
00:40:33,355 --> 00:40:35,055
No.

813
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:36,723
No, no...

814
00:40:53,809 --> 00:40:56,977
"The Ars Deicidium"?

815
00:40:57,012 --> 00:40:58,612
"The Art of Killing Gods."

816
00:41:02,117 --> 00:41:04,818
Eliot? Oh, thank God.

817
00:41:04,853 --> 00:41:06,653
I don't know what to do.

818
00:41:06,688 --> 00:41:08,355
Margo made a deal with
the fairies and they're

819
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:10,690
coming for our baby.

820
00:41:13,362 --> 00:41:15,328
A deal is a deal.

821
00:41:22,738 --> 00:41:25,005
You've been staring
at that page for an hour.

822
00:41:26,375 --> 00:41:28,008
Oh.

823
00:41:30,712 --> 00:41:32,746
I just keep seeing her face.

824
00:41:38,353 --> 00:41:40,153
I get that you're hurting.

825
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:45,659
I don't know what to say
to make you feel better.

826
00:41:45,694 --> 00:41:47,961
It's okay.

827
00:41:47,996 --> 00:41:50,297
I don't really want
to feel better anyway.

828
00:42:03,178 --> 00:42:06,589
Maybe I better not show you this then.

829
00:42:07,382 --> 00:42:09,850
I think I figured out
what an Ancient One is.

830
00:42:16,892 --> 00:42:19,092
No fucking way.
