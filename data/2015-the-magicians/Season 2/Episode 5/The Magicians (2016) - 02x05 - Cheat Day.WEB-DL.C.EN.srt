1
00:00:01,213 --> 00:00:02,320
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,926
You may address me as Reynard the Fox,

3
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:07,027
trickster of the faithful,
the very stupid.

4
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:11,850
You must be Marina.

5
00:00:13,574 --> 00:00:16,408
I need you to tell me
about the thing that killed you.

6
00:00:16,443 --> 00:00:19,344
There was a girl.

7
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:23,181
40 years ago, she vanished
Reynard from Earth.

8
00:00:23,217 --> 00:00:25,350
Charlie, my brother,
he was really, really good.

9
00:00:25,385 --> 00:00:27,119
You know that spell I did
on the first day of class

10
00:00:27,154 --> 00:00:28,620
with the glass horse? He taught me that.

11
00:00:28,655 --> 00:00:31,990
I fell for this professor.
He was married.

12
00:00:32,025 --> 00:00:35,360
I thought I could make him love me again

13
00:00:35,395 --> 00:00:37,696
if I could make myself prettier.

14
00:00:37,731 --> 00:00:40,332
I really believed he might
actually be able

15
00:00:40,367 --> 00:00:41,933
to undo what I did.

16
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:45,036
It burned until he wasn't there anymore.

17
00:00:45,072 --> 00:00:47,472
I gave up magic and never looked back.

18
00:00:50,644 --> 00:00:52,644
No!

19
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:54,212
Alice is gone.

20
00:00:54,248 --> 00:00:55,580
There's a creature,

21
00:00:55,616 --> 00:00:57,015
she's called the White Lady.

22
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:58,350
I want my hands back.

23
00:00:58,385 --> 00:01:00,552
No!

24
00:01:00,587 --> 00:01:03,054
Alice Quinn. Bring her back to life.

25
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,256
I can't.

26
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:05,624
Is there nothing else you desire?

27
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:06,659
Send me home.

28
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,467
I spoke with Professor Lipson

29
00:01:15,502 --> 00:01:17,269
about the tests she ran.

30
00:01:17,304 --> 00:01:19,571
But I'm sorry to say that

31
00:01:19,606 --> 00:01:21,206
we don't even know where to start.

32
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:23,108
Okay, is this a normal candle or what...

33
00:01:28,215 --> 00:01:29,514
Of course.

34
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,116
You cure your own hands
just fine, but mine,

35
00:01:31,151 --> 00:01:32,517
you can't do a fucking thing about, huh?

36
00:01:32,553 --> 00:01:37,422
Broken or not, my hands are my hands.

37
00:01:37,457 --> 00:01:39,424
Yours are something else.

38
00:01:39,459 --> 00:01:41,193
There's nothing we can do.

39
00:01:41,228 --> 00:01:42,994
And Brakebills continues its tradition

40
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,296
of fucking my shit.

41
00:01:44,331 --> 00:01:46,398
There's nothing we can do here.

42
00:01:46,433 --> 00:01:49,334
There are other options.

43
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:53,138
One, I send you to someone
who may know more.

44
00:01:53,173 --> 00:01:54,306
Yes. Who is it?

45
00:01:54,341 --> 00:01:55,607
Professor Mayakovsky.

46
00:01:55,642 --> 00:01:57,375
The drunk perv in the igloo?

47
00:01:57,411 --> 00:01:58,710
Pass.

48
00:01:58,745 --> 00:02:00,245
What's option two?

49
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,981
Hmm, well, you won't have to worry

50
00:02:03,016 --> 00:02:05,116
about your hands or magic at all.

51
00:02:05,152 --> 00:02:07,052
It's actually where I sent Quentin.

52
00:02:07,087 --> 00:02:09,020
Where's Quentin?

53
00:02:20,701 --> 00:02:23,134
So we finally get
to the cashier and guess what.

54
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:27,005
- Hmm?
- I left my wallet in the car.

55
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,641
- Oh, man.
- Talk about bad timing.

56
00:02:29,676 --> 00:02:31,776
Yeah.

57
00:02:31,812 --> 00:02:34,279
Hey, does Donut House,
does that taste like donuts?

58
00:02:34,314 --> 00:02:36,348
I just use that thing for soup.

59
00:02:36,383 --> 00:02:38,783
Soup?

60
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:40,819
What the fuck?

61
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:24,741

62
00:03:38,578 --> 00:03:42,247
Hello?

63
00:03:43,317 --> 00:03:45,417
Professor Mayakovsky?

64
00:03:52,626 --> 00:03:54,359
Shh...

65
00:03:54,394 --> 00:03:56,828
Hey! Hey, let me down!

66
00:03:56,863 --> 00:03:59,297
I'm a student!

67
00:04:02,502 --> 00:04:04,135
Dick.

68
00:04:07,407 --> 00:04:10,075
"Chicago Register." July '76.

69
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,209
You know, dead or not,
Marina could have been

70
00:04:11,244 --> 00:04:12,677
a little more specific.

71
00:04:12,713 --> 00:04:15,513
I still don't know what I'm looking for.

72
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:18,183
Look, banishing Reynard had to
take an insane amount of energy.

73
00:04:18,218 --> 00:04:22,320
So any sort of strange event
or operation.

74
00:04:22,356 --> 00:04:25,357
Yeah, that's literally
the definition of "news."

75
00:04:25,392 --> 00:04:27,158
We'll know it when we see it.

76
00:04:43,643 --> 00:04:45,543
I need some fuel.

77
00:04:54,821 --> 00:04:56,988
Okay.

78
00:05:01,528 --> 00:05:02,894
You okay?

79
00:05:09,469 --> 00:05:11,703
Is that the second time today?

80
00:05:11,738 --> 00:05:13,671
Third.

81
00:05:22,549 --> 00:05:24,315
Here.

82
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:27,385
Oh, God, Jules, I...

83
00:05:27,421 --> 00:05:28,787
- Fuck!
- Hey.

84
00:05:28,822 --> 00:05:30,555
- Fuck.
- Hey, come on, come on.

85
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,690
- Hey, sit.
- Why?

86
00:05:32,726 --> 00:05:34,826
Why won't it just end?

87
00:05:34,861 --> 00:05:37,862
Why does it just keep getting
worse and worse?

88
00:05:37,898 --> 00:05:39,631
I'm so sorry.

89
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:41,699
Whatever's... what's the spell

90
00:05:41,735 --> 00:05:43,601
to terminate it or whatever?

91
00:05:43,637 --> 00:05:45,336
I mean, there's stuff out
there, but it's all shady,

92
00:05:45,372 --> 00:05:48,540
Dark Ages shit from before
modern medicine.

93
00:05:48,575 --> 00:05:50,708
You don't cauterize a paper cut

94
00:05:50,744 --> 00:05:52,877
with a crazy, medieval blowtorch.

95
00:05:52,913 --> 00:05:55,613
Sounds like exactly what I wanna do.

96
00:05:55,649 --> 00:05:57,749
Not if it erases your uterus and kidneys

97
00:05:57,784 --> 00:05:59,717
along with the fetus.

98
00:05:59,753 --> 00:06:01,419
Jesus.

99
00:06:01,455 --> 00:06:04,689
Hey, it's... it's okay.

100
00:06:04,724 --> 00:06:08,560
Jules, this is a simple,
totally mundane procedure.

101
00:06:08,595 --> 00:06:10,895
Is it? 'Cause it might not be a simple,

102
00:06:10,931 --> 00:06:12,730
totally mundane human embryo.

103
00:06:12,766 --> 00:06:14,933
I mean...

104
00:06:14,968 --> 00:06:18,703
I don't even know if it's
Reynard's or Richard's.

105
00:06:18,738 --> 00:06:23,575
Right now, it is just a clump of cells.

106
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:27,245
Okay, so, let's just
put a pin in all this, okay?

107
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,280
We'll make an appointment.

108
00:06:37,023 --> 00:06:40,391
Your Majesty. It's ready.

109
00:06:40,427 --> 00:06:43,761
At the very least, I hope you
solved the carbonation issue.

110
00:06:43,797 --> 00:06:48,032
We had to dump that last glass
in another world, you know.

111
00:06:48,068 --> 00:06:50,001
Still bubbling.

112
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,009
Oh, the miles we must walk.

113
00:06:58,044 --> 00:07:01,212
My King. I have the best news.

114
00:07:01,248 --> 00:07:03,681
If that rabbit
was a prosecco, I'd agree.

115
00:07:03,717 --> 00:07:05,950
This isn't just a rabbit.

116
00:07:05,986 --> 00:07:08,686
- Pregnant.
- Jesus.

117
00:07:08,722 --> 00:07:10,522
We're going to be parents.

118
00:07:10,557 --> 00:07:12,857
That rabbit knows if you're...

119
00:07:12,893 --> 00:07:15,293
- Pregnant.
- Okay, okay.

120
00:07:18,298 --> 00:07:20,031
- You're not smiling.
- I'm sorry.

121
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:21,766
- It's just... you see...
- Pregnant.

122
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:24,536
Okay, rabbit! Chill.

123
00:07:27,307 --> 00:07:28,973
Ah, ah! Where do you think you're going?

124
00:07:29,009 --> 00:07:31,309
It may suck all the moisture
from my tongue,

125
00:07:31,344 --> 00:07:34,846
but damned if I'm not going
to toast to this shit.

126
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:38,683
To our violently attractive progeny.

127
00:07:48,962 --> 00:07:50,995
Hey, yo! Yo, let me down, okay?

128
00:07:51,031 --> 00:07:54,632
What the fuck is this shit?

129
00:07:54,668 --> 00:07:56,434
What do you want?

130
00:07:56,469 --> 00:07:58,870
My hands can't cast spells anymore.

131
00:07:58,905 --> 00:08:03,441
This is not Mayakovsy's Home
for Magically Inert.

132
00:08:03,476 --> 00:08:07,712
But maybe an exchange.

133
00:08:07,747 --> 00:08:09,380
What do you got in mind?

134
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,482
I'm in the middle of project.

135
00:08:11,518 --> 00:08:14,686
Help me, I do what I can.

136
00:08:17,591 --> 00:08:19,657
- I'm in.
- Okay.

137
00:08:27,801 --> 00:08:29,601
Is everybody out here
really so lifeless?

138
00:08:29,636 --> 00:08:33,438
Yes. We are, we are.
That's why we drink.

139
00:08:33,473 --> 00:08:34,939
Well, I drink just fine as a Magician.

140
00:08:34,975 --> 00:08:37,108
Yeah, because your world
was so overwhelming and scary

141
00:08:37,143 --> 00:08:38,643
and you needed a break from it all.

142
00:08:38,678 --> 00:08:39,844
Now you're gonna drink

143
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:41,346
because each day is so goddamn dull

144
00:08:41,381 --> 00:08:44,616
and that takes a lot more booze.

145
00:08:44,651 --> 00:08:45,917
You ever cast anymore?

146
00:08:45,952 --> 00:08:47,151
God, no.

147
00:08:47,187 --> 00:08:48,653
Sorry, that was stupid.

148
00:08:48,688 --> 00:08:50,722
No, it's okay.

149
00:08:50,757 --> 00:08:52,023
I mean, nobody ever gives up magic

150
00:08:52,058 --> 00:08:55,426
because everything's peachy.

151
00:08:55,462 --> 00:08:57,195
You wanna tell me?

152
00:09:03,536 --> 00:09:04,936
- Uh...
- I'm sorry.

153
00:09:04,971 --> 00:09:07,472
No. I shouldn't have asked.

154
00:09:07,507 --> 00:09:10,441
I can see that it's recent.

155
00:09:10,477 --> 00:09:13,511
It's fucking madness.

156
00:09:13,546 --> 00:09:16,381
Teaching that stuff to kids.
I mean... kids.

157
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,016
It's like, what's the point? You know?

158
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:19,951
'Cause it feels like for every
one thing that we fix,

159
00:09:19,986 --> 00:09:22,720
five shitty things
spring up in its place.

160
00:09:22,756 --> 00:09:25,023
Because each spell
is just another complication.

161
00:09:25,058 --> 00:09:26,858
That we cast another spell to fix.

162
00:09:26,893 --> 00:09:28,926
Repeat, repeat, repeat.

163
00:09:28,962 --> 00:09:32,830
Until there's no spell left
and you're just...

164
00:09:32,866 --> 00:09:37,468
- you're left with...
- A big fucking problem.

165
00:09:40,106 --> 00:09:43,908
Oh, shit. I have a meeting in 15.

166
00:09:43,943 --> 00:09:45,743
Ooh.

167
00:09:48,148 --> 00:09:50,014
I'm sorry. That was just reflex.

168
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:53,584
Uh, that... I... um...

169
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:57,855
Just... just put this
on the company card.

170
00:09:57,891 --> 00:09:59,490
They won't notice.

171
00:10:01,928 --> 00:10:03,594
I am happy.

172
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:05,563
Yay, a baby.

173
00:10:05,598 --> 00:10:08,232
Eliot, what is this about?

174
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:13,204
I really wanna know.

175
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:17,608
My father was not the best...

176
00:10:17,644 --> 00:10:19,043
Wine, Your Majesty.

177
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:20,778
Bad dad.

178
00:10:20,814 --> 00:10:25,550
So I suppose I don't
exactly have the proper,

179
00:10:25,585 --> 00:10:27,552
uh, uh...

180
00:10:27,587 --> 00:10:29,120
template to...

181
00:10:29,155 --> 00:10:31,022
Ahh!

182
00:10:31,057 --> 00:10:33,257
Quiet!

183
00:10:33,293 --> 00:10:35,960
You are not welcome here,
child of Earth.

184
00:10:38,164 --> 00:10:39,263
Eliot!

185
00:10:48,608 --> 00:10:51,109
Wait.

186
00:10:51,144 --> 00:10:53,077
This is not over, child of Earth.

187
00:10:57,684 --> 00:10:59,584
Dungeon.

188
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,921
What the hell was that about?

189
00:11:03,957 --> 00:11:07,058
I tried expressing my emotions.

190
00:11:07,093 --> 00:11:09,193
Lesson learned.

191
00:11:12,636 --> 00:11:16,766
Shittiest security ever.

192
00:11:17,882 --> 00:11:19,816
So what are we supposed to do?

193
00:11:19,851 --> 00:11:22,452
- Ship 'em back to Loria?
- Actually, Your Highness,

194
00:11:22,487 --> 00:11:24,220
he's not from Loria.

195
00:11:24,256 --> 00:11:25,922
He's a native Fillorian.

196
00:11:25,957 --> 00:11:28,524
My own people are trying to kill me?

197
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,660
Hmm. So French.

198
00:11:30,695 --> 00:11:33,429
They're commoners. Not to worry.

199
00:11:33,465 --> 00:11:35,932
Oh, whoa, whoa. I'm worried.

200
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:39,235
I urge a public execution, today.

201
00:11:39,271 --> 00:11:41,771
Might I suggest strangulation?

202
00:11:41,806 --> 00:11:43,339
For the symbolism.

203
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:44,707
We don't wish to fall to his level.

204
00:11:44,743 --> 00:11:46,976
The Bed of a Thousand Spikes
should do just fine.

205
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:56,352
Her Slowness suggests tying
each of his limbs to a centaur,

206
00:11:56,388 --> 00:11:59,289
and as they stretch him, inch by inch,

207
00:11:59,324 --> 00:12:03,860
a fifth centaur sets the spike,
if you will.

208
00:12:03,895 --> 00:12:05,528
Jesus, no.

209
00:12:05,563 --> 00:12:08,398
Everyone out. This is a matter
for the Queen and me.

210
00:12:09,901 --> 00:12:12,935
That sloth is psychotic.

211
00:12:12,971 --> 00:12:15,471
It's all psychotic.

212
00:12:15,507 --> 00:12:17,907
Did you hear how Tick said "commoners"?

213
00:12:17,942 --> 00:12:20,243
When we're the least snobby
people in a room,

214
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:22,612
there's something wrong with the room.

215
00:12:29,788 --> 00:12:31,354
Yes?

216
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:33,856
I wanted to apologize.

217
00:12:33,892 --> 00:12:37,360
I'm sorry, um...

218
00:12:37,395 --> 00:12:38,995
Okay.

219
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,833
What?

220
00:12:43,868 --> 00:12:49,639
I just... I don't know
if you accepted my apology.

221
00:12:49,674 --> 00:12:52,875
Yes.

222
00:12:52,911 --> 00:12:55,578
- Okay.
- Actually, no.

223
00:12:55,613 --> 00:12:58,014
No, I don't.

224
00:12:58,049 --> 00:13:00,817
We had just talked about
how terrible magic is,

225
00:13:00,852 --> 00:13:03,286
and then you went and did it.

226
00:13:03,321 --> 00:13:05,588
It was just a tiny spell.

227
00:13:05,623 --> 00:13:07,390
There are a lot of companies like this.

228
00:13:07,425 --> 00:13:09,659
I'm sure Fogg can find
another one for you.

229
00:13:13,498 --> 00:13:14,897
Okay.

230
00:13:32,484 --> 00:13:33,850
They're useless, right?

231
00:13:33,885 --> 00:13:37,820
Well, maybe not useless.

232
00:13:40,558 --> 00:13:43,393
You can still grab hold
of things, wave hello,

233
00:13:43,428 --> 00:13:45,094
rub away a lonely night.

234
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:46,496
Okay, but for magic?

235
00:13:46,531 --> 00:13:48,398
For magic? Useless.

236
00:13:50,802 --> 00:13:52,769
How was your travel?

237
00:13:52,804 --> 00:13:54,937
Fine.

238
00:13:54,973 --> 00:13:58,107
Aim's good. I just can't
take people with me.

239
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,076
Some might call that blessing.

240
00:14:00,111 --> 00:14:02,612
Yeah, well the option
would be nice, so...

241
00:14:02,647 --> 00:14:04,547
I mean, can you help me?
What are we doing here?

242
00:14:04,582 --> 00:14:06,315
I can help you.

243
00:14:06,351 --> 00:14:09,452
But first, your end of deal.

244
00:14:19,497 --> 00:14:21,597
Take out all the knots.

245
00:14:23,902 --> 00:14:26,936
What the hell?

246
00:14:26,971 --> 00:14:31,140
- Ms. Wicker.
- Uh, Julia.

247
00:14:31,176 --> 00:14:34,577
The test was positive.

248
00:14:34,612 --> 00:14:37,113
If you'd like, we can
discuss your options.

249
00:14:37,148 --> 00:14:39,649
- I want an abortion.
- Okay.

250
00:14:39,684 --> 00:14:41,818
That's something that we can
perform here in office.

251
00:14:41,853 --> 00:14:44,921
Great. Uh, today?

252
00:14:44,956 --> 00:14:46,689
Unfortunately, we do have
a waiting list,

253
00:14:46,724 --> 00:14:48,424
but it should just be a couple of days.

254
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,527
Days?

255
00:14:51,563 --> 00:14:54,163
Doctor, I can't wait a couple of days.

256
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:56,666
Please, I...

257
00:14:58,603 --> 00:15:03,639
If I suspect abuse,
I'm obligated to report it.

258
00:15:03,675 --> 00:15:05,508
Julia, you're safe here.

259
00:15:05,543 --> 00:15:07,910
You can talk about what happened.

260
00:15:07,946 --> 00:15:12,515
No one is above the law.

261
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,784
Ah, sorry.

262
00:15:14,819 --> 00:15:18,554
I wish that were true.

263
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,023
Look, I just want this to be over,

264
00:15:21,059 --> 00:15:24,527
and you can help me.

265
00:15:24,562 --> 00:15:27,463
Please.

266
00:15:27,499 --> 00:15:29,532
Okay.

267
00:15:29,567 --> 00:15:31,868
We'll set you up
for an ultrasound today.

268
00:15:31,903 --> 00:15:35,004
Tomorrow, you can perform the procedure.

269
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:37,473
We open at 8:00.

270
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:40,610
- Thank you.
- See you then.

271
00:15:53,563 --> 00:15:54,496
Hi.

272
00:15:54,532 --> 00:15:55,931
Leave.

273
00:15:55,967 --> 00:15:58,534
- You don't get to say that.
- And why not?

274
00:15:58,569 --> 00:16:00,836
Uh, because you're in our castle.

275
00:16:00,871 --> 00:16:03,005
Which is on my land.

276
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,774
Uh, excuse me, my manners.

277
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,710
I'm Eliot, High King of Fillory.

278
00:16:07,745 --> 00:16:12,614
And I'm Bayler, a proud
soldier of Fillorians United.

279
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,883
A FU fighter.

280
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:17,753
- Did you say, "Foo Fighter"?
- Margo, behave.

281
00:16:17,788 --> 00:16:21,090
We will not rest until a
Fillorian sits upon the throne.

282
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,792
Okay, tell Ember.

283
00:16:23,828 --> 00:16:25,060
He issued the decree.

284
00:16:25,096 --> 00:16:27,997
We will execute every child of Earth

285
00:16:28,032 --> 00:16:31,567
that crosses into our land until
there are none left to kill.

286
00:16:31,602 --> 00:16:34,470
And yet, you laugh.

287
00:16:36,707 --> 00:16:39,041
- I mean, a Foo Fighter?
- Margo.

288
00:16:39,076 --> 00:16:42,911
If we execute him, then he's a martyr.

289
00:16:42,947 --> 00:16:44,947
Shit.

290
00:16:44,982 --> 00:16:46,915
When was the last time
either of us dealt with

291
00:16:46,951 --> 00:16:49,084
a political insurgency?

292
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,054
Unless getting kicked out
of a fivesome counts.

293
00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:53,722
- First for me.
- Same.

294
00:16:53,758 --> 00:16:56,025
I'm thinking we should probably bone up.

295
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,826
Like, study?

296
00:16:57,862 --> 00:16:59,762
I'll grab what I can from
the Brakebills Library.

297
00:16:59,797 --> 00:17:01,063
Fine.

298
00:17:01,098 --> 00:17:03,899
And grab some Adderall
while you're there.

299
00:17:12,443 --> 00:17:16,078
Okay, I'm done.

300
00:17:16,113 --> 00:17:18,714
Oh, shit! What?
Do not... don't... please...

301
00:17:18,749 --> 00:17:20,449
don't sneak up on me like that.

302
00:17:20,484 --> 00:17:21,984
This is my house.

303
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:23,852
Look, I finished untying
your bondage kit.

304
00:17:23,888 --> 00:17:25,054
You gonna teach me now?

305
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:27,689
You finish first step.

306
00:17:27,725 --> 00:17:30,959
Next... the table.

307
00:17:33,697 --> 00:17:35,197
What about it?

308
00:17:35,232 --> 00:17:37,566
You make it sawdust.

309
00:17:37,601 --> 00:17:41,970
Do not worry. I give you tool.

310
00:17:42,006 --> 00:17:44,039
Enjoy.

311
00:17:57,254 --> 00:18:00,255
What are you still doing here?

312
00:18:00,291 --> 00:18:02,191
I'm just finishing up.

313
00:18:02,226 --> 00:18:03,792
Gonna jerk it?

314
00:18:03,828 --> 00:18:05,661
- Break in the office?
- No.

315
00:18:05,696 --> 00:18:06,795
What? No, I'm...

316
00:18:06,831 --> 00:18:07,963
It's the only place I can.

317
00:18:07,998 --> 00:18:11,667
Wife and two kids? No privacy at home.

318
00:18:11,702 --> 00:18:14,736
I'm not doing that...

319
00:18:14,772 --> 00:18:15,871
here.

320
00:18:15,906 --> 00:18:17,940
Just saying. It's no judgment.

321
00:18:17,975 --> 00:18:20,609
Adios.

322
00:18:24,615 --> 00:18:28,083
I owe you an apology for being a bitch.

323
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:30,819
Could you knock, please?

324
00:18:32,256 --> 00:18:34,223
What? Were you masturbating
in your office?

325
00:18:34,258 --> 00:18:35,824
No!

326
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,893
Whatever. I do.

327
00:18:37,928 --> 00:18:39,761
What is this place?

328
00:18:44,135 --> 00:18:46,034
I'm sorry, again, about the spell, I...

329
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:49,738
I'm sorry for making you feel sorry.

330
00:18:49,773 --> 00:18:54,543
It was just a stupid spell.

331
00:18:54,578 --> 00:18:56,044
Thank you.

332
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,679
Want some?

333
00:18:57,715 --> 00:18:59,715
Vodka. Bit of lime.

334
00:19:04,755 --> 00:19:06,588
You should stay.

335
00:19:06,624 --> 00:19:07,789
Forget what I said earlier.

336
00:19:07,825 --> 00:19:12,161
I think we'd be good friends.

337
00:19:12,196 --> 00:19:14,696
I would like that.

338
00:19:14,732 --> 00:19:16,765
What the hell are we
still doing in the office?

339
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,168
Right? Let's get out of here.

340
00:19:19,203 --> 00:19:20,536
- Mm.
- Finish that.

341
00:19:20,571 --> 00:19:22,604
- Come on.
- Okay.

342
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,139
Yes!

343
00:19:31,015 --> 00:19:32,748
Take a break.

344
00:19:34,251 --> 00:19:36,618
No trick, no test. I promise.

345
00:19:45,095 --> 00:19:46,628
That's it?

346
00:19:46,664 --> 00:19:49,798
Take your balls out
of your purse and drink.

347
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,736
No, if we're gonna talk
about what we did,

348
00:19:54,772 --> 00:19:56,104
then we have to call it what it is.

349
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,040
It's stupid. It's so fucking stupid.

350
00:19:58,075 --> 00:20:00,142
It's the stupidest
I've ever fucking been.

351
00:20:00,177 --> 00:20:02,344
Reynard set us up.

352
00:20:02,379 --> 00:20:04,346
Yeah, but I should have known better.

353
00:20:04,381 --> 00:20:08,250
You know, I knew the difference
between magic and miracles.

354
00:20:08,285 --> 00:20:12,154
One is real and one is
a lie with sparkles.

355
00:20:12,189 --> 00:20:16,792
Like a nice female god was
gonna glide in and save...

356
00:20:16,827 --> 00:20:19,761
It sounds so naive
to ever believe in that.

357
00:20:19,797 --> 00:20:22,331
Look, there is one way through this,

358
00:20:22,366 --> 00:20:25,834
and that is to find out
what happened 40 years ago.

359
00:20:25,869 --> 00:20:27,769
Yeah, and banish the fuck
out of Reynard.

360
00:20:27,805 --> 00:20:31,240
Yeah, so let's just get this
pesky abortion out of the way,

361
00:20:31,275 --> 00:20:33,675
and that's next on the list.

362
00:20:33,711 --> 00:20:36,044
I know this is
a straightforward procedure.

363
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,081
It's probably, you know,
the simplest thing

364
00:20:39,116 --> 00:20:42,217
I've had to deal with in months.

365
00:20:42,253 --> 00:20:44,253
But I am nervous.

366
00:20:48,926 --> 00:20:51,393
I had one.

367
00:20:54,732 --> 00:20:57,065
He was a drummer.

368
00:20:59,103 --> 00:21:01,803
And he said he couldn't
get it up with a condom.

369
00:21:03,807 --> 00:21:05,741
But...

370
00:21:05,776 --> 00:21:10,178
I...I remember the night before.

371
00:21:10,214 --> 00:21:13,215
It... I felt...

372
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:17,119
I felt lonely.

373
00:21:20,057 --> 00:21:21,823
Yeah.

374
00:21:21,859 --> 00:21:24,693
But you're not alone.

375
00:21:24,728 --> 00:21:26,728
I'm your best bitch, remember?

376
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,033
Yeah.

377
00:21:31,068 --> 00:21:34,403
Okay, your turn. Truth or dare.

378
00:21:34,438 --> 00:21:37,239
Truth.

379
00:21:37,274 --> 00:21:39,207
Do you still blame yourself?

380
00:21:39,243 --> 00:21:41,943
Shit. Okay.

381
00:21:41,979 --> 00:21:43,345
Sorry, no.

382
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:46,315
I think I'm drunker than I think I am.

383
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:48,116
Was that a sentence?

384
00:21:48,152 --> 00:21:51,219
No, I said truth.

385
00:21:51,255 --> 00:21:55,457
So do you know what happened?

386
00:21:55,492 --> 00:21:57,059
I mean, just what Alice told me.

387
00:21:57,094 --> 00:22:00,896
That you changed your face
for a professor

388
00:22:00,931 --> 00:22:04,266
and it got screwed up
and Charlie tried to save you.

389
00:22:04,301 --> 00:22:06,335
Yeah, that's the gist.

390
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:10,105
How is Alice?

391
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,240
Uh, Alice is dead.

392
00:22:23,354 --> 00:22:26,021
I don't blame myself.

393
00:22:26,056 --> 00:22:29,758
Except for when I first wake up...

394
00:22:29,793 --> 00:22:31,393
and when I go to bed

395
00:22:31,428 --> 00:22:36,264
and all the time in between.

396
00:22:40,537 --> 00:22:42,537
Your turn.

397
00:22:45,075 --> 00:22:46,908
Dare.

398
00:22:46,944 --> 00:22:48,577
Dare.

399
00:22:52,383 --> 00:22:53,949
My dare is to smoke weed?

400
00:22:53,984 --> 00:22:56,318
It's very middle school.

401
00:22:59,289 --> 00:23:01,523
Oh, oh.

402
00:23:01,558 --> 00:23:03,925
Do you know...

403
00:23:03,961 --> 00:23:05,460
do you know Weizenheim's Third?

404
00:23:05,496 --> 00:23:08,096
It's a tiny, little
weather suspension spell.

405
00:23:08,132 --> 00:23:10,232
- I thought you didn't...
- I don't.

406
00:23:10,267 --> 00:23:11,933
This doesn't count.

407
00:23:11,969 --> 00:23:13,201
Today's a cheat day.

408
00:23:13,237 --> 00:23:16,037
Right.

409
00:23:16,073 --> 00:23:19,508
Oh, the trick to this one
is that you enchant your lips.

410
00:23:31,522 --> 00:23:34,523
- And you're a smoke artiste.
- Mm. Okay.

411
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:35,924
Your turn.

412
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:37,392
Don't, like, burn yourself.

413
00:23:37,428 --> 00:23:39,428
- Okay, how do you do it?
- Oh, um...

414
00:23:39,463 --> 00:23:40,862
Okay, let me.

415
00:24:01,385 --> 00:24:03,351
You're a fucking dork.

416
00:24:03,387 --> 00:24:05,487
You're just jealous that
I'm such a quick study.

417
00:24:05,522 --> 00:24:08,490
Yeah.

418
00:24:08,525 --> 00:24:10,525
Okay.

419
00:24:19,369 --> 00:24:21,069
What is that?

420
00:24:21,104 --> 00:24:22,971
This one's my favorite.

421
00:24:32,182 --> 00:24:34,015
That's my favorite, too.

422
00:24:38,322 --> 00:24:39,988
- Ooh!
- Come on in.

423
00:24:40,023 --> 00:24:42,390
Okay.

424
00:24:42,426 --> 00:24:44,960
Emily Greenstreet,

425
00:24:44,995 --> 00:24:47,429
living the loft life, huh?

426
00:24:47,464 --> 00:24:49,498
Yeah.

427
00:24:49,533 --> 00:24:50,966
Wine opener?

428
00:24:51,001 --> 00:24:53,134
One of those drawers. One of the...

429
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:55,504
Wine opener.

430
00:24:55,539 --> 00:24:58,440
Ahh, wine opener, wine opener.

431
00:24:58,475 --> 00:25:01,209
Hey.

432
00:25:01,245 --> 00:25:05,413
I wanna do a spell.

433
00:25:05,449 --> 00:25:07,215
Why don't we keep drinking

434
00:25:07,251 --> 00:25:11,353
and make some really,
really bad decisions?

435
00:25:11,388 --> 00:25:14,032
That sounds, I don't know, kind of fun.

436
00:25:14,057 --> 00:25:17,181
Yeah. You'll like it.

437
00:25:17,928 --> 00:25:20,263
- Mm.
- Come on.

438
00:25:21,154 --> 00:25:22,964
Cheat day.

439
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:26,273
The defenestration of Prague.

440
00:25:26,328 --> 00:25:27,427
No, you already said that.

441
00:25:27,463 --> 00:25:29,196
- There were two.
- Mm.

442
00:25:29,931 --> 00:25:31,898
Look, any hope you had
of saving this guy

443
00:25:31,933 --> 00:25:33,332
is out the window.

444
00:25:33,368 --> 00:25:35,723
Like the guys in Prague.

445
00:25:37,939 --> 00:25:39,405
Shit.

446
00:25:39,441 --> 00:25:45,111
Eliot, we said we'd do
whatever actually works.

447
00:25:45,146 --> 00:25:48,281
Fine. We'll tell the council
in the morning.

448
00:25:48,316 --> 00:25:49,482
But I'll do it.

449
00:25:49,517 --> 00:25:52,185
The man's life is my burden to bear.

450
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:56,288
Get over yourself, Ned Stark.

451
00:25:58,026 --> 00:25:59,826
Ned Stark.

452
00:26:11,206 --> 00:26:13,473
Do you even like magic?

453
00:26:13,508 --> 00:26:15,975
Yeah, like...

454
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:20,313
Like I like money or food
or any other useful shit.

455
00:26:20,348 --> 00:26:23,015
Money and food
don't explode in your face.

456
00:26:23,051 --> 00:26:26,786
You came to Brakebills
only to ease your suffering.

457
00:26:26,821 --> 00:26:30,256
The voices. It was all chore and burden.

458
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:33,159
But you saved yourself, traveler.

459
00:26:33,194 --> 00:26:35,962
Good.

460
00:26:35,997 --> 00:26:38,464
Maybe you're simply done.

461
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:42,468
Now's your chance. Walk away.

462
00:26:42,504 --> 00:26:46,272
Why? Chance at what?

463
00:26:46,307 --> 00:26:49,876
Few years of happy life.

464
00:26:52,147 --> 00:26:57,216
There is bad surprise
in store for everyone.

465
00:26:57,252 --> 00:27:00,887
What surprise?

466
00:27:00,922 --> 00:27:05,391
Energy current should be constant.

467
00:27:07,195 --> 00:27:12,064
But it's not. Why?

468
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,300
There is something happening to magic.

469
00:27:14,335 --> 00:27:16,836
The wellspring in Fillory.

470
00:27:16,871 --> 00:27:20,006
- The current is sputtering.
- And they're trying to fix it.

471
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:22,308
Maybe it's going to disappear.

472
00:27:22,343 --> 00:27:24,977
- If that's the case...
- Shit could get real.

473
00:27:25,013 --> 00:27:29,115
If magic goes, it will be
very bad time to be Magician,

474
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:32,852
so consider the advantage
of getting out now.

475
00:27:32,887 --> 00:27:34,587
All right. Okay, thank you.

476
00:27:34,622 --> 00:27:37,857
I'll meditate on it. I...

477
00:27:37,892 --> 00:27:40,960
Right now, I'm staying.

478
00:27:40,995 --> 00:27:45,164
Then you're just fancy scarf
wrapped around an idiot.

479
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,633
You know what?
If it's so bad, you get out!

480
00:27:47,669 --> 00:27:50,436
You leave, I'll leave.

481
00:27:50,471 --> 00:27:53,639
I cannot leave. Thanks for reminder.

482
00:27:53,675 --> 00:27:56,676
What... what, you're trapped here?

483
00:27:56,711 --> 00:27:59,245
Remarkably like that.

484
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,347
Incorporate bond.

485
00:28:01,382 --> 00:28:03,416
Even I cannot break.

486
00:28:03,451 --> 00:28:05,318
Why?

487
00:28:05,353 --> 00:28:09,488
What did you do?

488
00:28:09,524 --> 00:28:12,291
I'm not drunk enough to talk about it.

489
00:28:17,699 --> 00:28:22,101
Okay!

490
00:28:22,136 --> 00:28:24,203
I make love to many students.

491
00:28:24,239 --> 00:28:28,641
And then I fucked the wrong one.

492
00:28:28,676 --> 00:28:31,077
Oops.

493
00:28:31,112 --> 00:28:34,080
They sent you here? God.

494
00:28:34,115 --> 00:28:35,615
It was that...

495
00:28:39,621 --> 00:28:42,588
Or give up magic.

496
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:45,591
- Like you're telling me to.
- Yes.

497
00:28:45,627 --> 00:28:48,127
I made my choice.

498
00:29:03,378 --> 00:29:06,145
Wakey, wakey.

499
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:09,315
You have 15 minutes to save your life.

500
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:12,518
Tell me, if you were in charge,

501
00:29:12,553 --> 00:29:15,655
how would the FU Fighters fix Fillory?

502
00:29:17,325 --> 00:29:20,026
It's an illusion spell.

503
00:29:20,061 --> 00:29:21,527
Party trick, really. It'll only last

504
00:29:21,562 --> 00:29:24,463
as long as your skin's wet.

505
00:29:24,499 --> 00:29:25,998
You first.

506
00:29:26,034 --> 00:29:29,235
Yeah. You know, this is
the weirdest foreplay.

507
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,404
Oh, my God. Stop.

508
00:29:31,439 --> 00:29:33,739
Robe off!

509
00:29:37,145 --> 00:29:40,012
Whoa, what is that?

510
00:29:40,048 --> 00:29:41,547
Oh, right, uh...

511
00:29:41,582 --> 00:29:43,082
You joined some kinda gang?

512
00:29:43,117 --> 00:29:45,017
Yes.

513
00:29:45,053 --> 00:29:46,385
Okay.

514
00:29:46,421 --> 00:29:49,121
Hop in.

515
00:30:14,115 --> 00:30:16,282
Did it work?

516
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,223
Oh, shit.

517
00:30:24,258 --> 00:30:25,791
Don't judge me, please.

518
00:30:25,827 --> 00:30:29,662
I'm not. I'm just
putting it all together.

519
00:30:29,697 --> 00:30:32,565
You, Charlie.

520
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,334
That's why he's at Brakebills South.

521
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:36,669
I mean, I had a lot of theories.

522
00:30:36,704 --> 00:30:38,738
Shh.

523
00:30:38,773 --> 00:30:41,307
You're ruining it.

524
00:30:41,342 --> 00:30:45,811
Just tell me what you think
when you look at me.

525
00:30:45,847 --> 00:30:49,348
And can you maybe try a Russian accent?

526
00:31:00,294 --> 00:31:03,629
You didn't wanna...

527
00:31:03,664 --> 00:31:05,865
This is what I miss the most.

528
00:31:10,872 --> 00:31:14,340
So...

529
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:16,142
your turn.

530
00:31:40,601 --> 00:31:43,702
It's her.

531
00:31:43,738 --> 00:31:45,438
It's your memories.

532
00:31:48,776 --> 00:31:52,678
Well? Anything you wanna say?

533
00:31:54,589 --> 00:31:57,556
I just really fucking miss you.

534
00:32:49,266 --> 00:32:51,799
What is...

535
00:32:51,835 --> 00:32:56,070
- is that?
- Yeah.

536
00:32:56,106 --> 00:32:58,539
Um, hey, I... I've gotta get home.

537
00:32:58,575 --> 00:33:01,276
Um...

538
00:33:01,311 --> 00:33:03,211
I had a good time.

539
00:33:03,246 --> 00:33:05,713
You don't have to go.
We can do it again.

540
00:33:05,749 --> 00:33:07,315
You said yesterday was cheat day.

541
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:09,183
You can't...

542
00:33:09,219 --> 00:33:11,719
You can't cheat every day.

543
00:33:11,755 --> 00:33:14,455
I won't tell.

544
00:33:14,491 --> 00:33:18,159
No, I don't want to.

545
00:33:18,194 --> 00:33:20,395
So, what, you're... done with me?

546
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:23,097
I...I was helping you.

547
00:33:23,133 --> 00:33:24,832
That's not what I said.

548
00:33:24,868 --> 00:33:27,802
Tell me, then. What are you saying?

549
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,207
Last night was...

550
00:33:36,513 --> 00:33:38,746
It felt really good, and it was...

551
00:33:41,151 --> 00:33:44,719
Probably exactly what I needed, but I...

552
00:33:44,754 --> 00:33:49,590
It was also really weird and sad
and I feel awful.

553
00:33:49,626 --> 00:33:53,428
I feel worse than before.

554
00:33:53,463 --> 00:33:55,463
Apologies for my terrible life.

555
00:33:58,868 --> 00:34:01,469
I just don't wanna use magic like that.

556
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:08,876
I'm sorry for everything you lost.

557
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,783
I'll see you at work.

558
00:34:23,793 --> 00:34:28,596
It is after much deliberation
that I have decided...

559
00:34:28,631 --> 00:34:30,565
we will not execute the prisoner.

560
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,433
What?

561
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:35,136
Your Majesty, I'm...

562
00:34:35,171 --> 00:34:36,738
It is in Fillory's best interest.

563
00:34:36,773 --> 00:34:40,174
We agreed to have the prisoner
executed today.

564
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:42,877
We did. But I changed my mind.

565
00:34:45,181 --> 00:34:47,448
Well, I didn't.

566
00:34:47,484 --> 00:34:48,750
And I'm High Queen.

567
00:34:48,785 --> 00:34:50,685
The Queen may voice her opinion,

568
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,489
but ultimate judgment
belongs to the King.

569
00:34:54,524 --> 00:34:59,193
So this is what
the patriarchy smells like?

570
00:34:59,229 --> 00:35:01,262
It's not the freshest.

571
00:35:03,533 --> 00:35:05,833
You are a king. Act like it.

572
00:35:05,869 --> 00:35:08,836
I'm not just a king.

573
00:35:08,872 --> 00:35:10,605
Fen's pregnant.

574
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,541
I'm gonna be a father.

575
00:35:15,178 --> 00:35:18,246
Mm.

576
00:35:18,281 --> 00:35:20,381
And I would like to raise my child

577
00:35:20,417 --> 00:35:25,553
in a world that does not just
kill its problems away.

578
00:35:25,588 --> 00:35:30,191
We hear them and we
address them accordingly.

579
00:35:30,226 --> 00:35:32,393
That is fucking stupid.

580
00:35:32,429 --> 00:35:34,729
You wanna rule a kingdom? Guess what.

581
00:35:34,764 --> 00:35:38,599
People are gonna die no matter what.

582
00:35:38,635 --> 00:35:41,302
Just trying to make sure
that it isn't you, okay?

583
00:35:49,946 --> 00:35:51,679
Julia, I'll check you in.

584
00:35:51,714 --> 00:35:53,448
Dr. Higgins will be ready shortly.

585
00:35:55,351 --> 00:35:56,851
Okay.

586
00:36:10,767 --> 00:36:12,600
I'm sorry, you're not in here.

587
00:36:12,635 --> 00:36:13,801
Excuse me?

588
00:36:13,837 --> 00:36:15,870
You don't have an appointment.

589
00:36:15,905 --> 00:36:18,473
The doctor gave me one.
I mean, there must be a mistake.

590
00:36:18,508 --> 00:36:20,808
I'm sorry, but without an
appointment, I can't let you in.

591
00:36:20,844 --> 00:36:23,377
Look, it's Wicker. Julia Wicker.

592
00:36:23,413 --> 00:36:24,912
You just said my name two seconds ago.

593
00:36:24,948 --> 00:36:26,781
Can you just pick up the phone
and ask her?

594
00:36:31,454 --> 00:36:34,388
Doctor, there's a woman
claiming she's a patient.

595
00:36:34,424 --> 00:36:35,690
No, she doesn't.

596
00:36:35,725 --> 00:36:38,826
Uh, Julia Wicker.

597
00:36:38,862 --> 00:36:40,828
But, Doctor...

598
00:36:40,864 --> 00:36:43,764
Okay.

599
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,767
- You can go ahead.
- Yeah, thanks.

600
00:36:46,803 --> 00:36:49,570
I'll be right here.

601
00:37:00,808 --> 00:37:04,077
No geese!

602
00:37:04,112 --> 00:37:06,112
Oh.

603
00:37:06,147 --> 00:37:08,748
Phew.

604
00:37:08,783 --> 00:37:11,184
You finish table. Good work.

605
00:37:11,219 --> 00:37:14,053
Yeah, so can we get to this?

606
00:37:14,089 --> 00:37:16,723
Enough "Karate Kid" bullshit.

607
00:37:16,758 --> 00:37:18,858
Not bullshit.

608
00:37:21,096 --> 00:37:23,696
Ask yourself a question:

609
00:37:23,732 --> 00:37:27,267
What will a Magician need
if dark days come?

610
00:37:27,302 --> 00:37:29,669
Answer: magic.

611
00:37:29,704 --> 00:37:31,104
But if it is gone, it is gone, you say.

612
00:37:31,139 --> 00:37:34,874
Not so, if you store it like a battery.

613
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:37,076
That's what I am building.

614
00:37:44,953 --> 00:37:46,719
Those knots?

615
00:37:46,755 --> 00:37:49,255
Old class project, tied with magic.

616
00:37:49,291 --> 00:37:53,293
That table, stained through with magic.

617
00:37:53,328 --> 00:37:58,197
You release the energy,
I store it for rainy day.

618
00:37:58,233 --> 00:38:02,502
So my hands, are you
gonna teach me or what?

619
00:38:02,537 --> 00:38:05,705
You can travel to Fillory.

620
00:38:08,009 --> 00:38:10,176
It's the worst place
in the universe, yeah.

621
00:38:10,211 --> 00:38:13,746
You go there. Get this.

622
00:38:13,782 --> 00:38:16,049
Moss. You need moss.

623
00:38:16,084 --> 00:38:18,751
It's amazing. Can carry current.

624
00:38:18,787 --> 00:38:22,855
Do not care.

625
00:38:25,327 --> 00:38:28,027
I'll get it.

626
00:38:35,337 --> 00:38:37,603
Gods, it's good to see you.

627
00:38:37,639 --> 00:38:38,972
You asshole!

628
00:38:39,007 --> 00:38:40,773
You come here with no warning

629
00:38:40,809 --> 00:38:42,275
and try to kill my husband.

630
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:44,677
Of course I did.

631
00:38:44,713 --> 00:38:46,646
I thought you were waiting.

632
00:38:46,681 --> 00:38:48,648
I'm not a FU Fighter anymore.

633
00:38:48,683 --> 00:38:50,616
You always knew
that one day I'd have to...

634
00:38:50,652 --> 00:38:54,153
Marry him, yes, and then
you'd be here, on the inside.

635
00:38:54,189 --> 00:38:58,624
You can't tell me that you don't
care about Fillory anymore.

636
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,360
I'm pregnant.

637
00:39:04,065 --> 00:39:06,265
- Then for the child.
- What?

638
00:39:06,301 --> 00:39:08,234
All I ask is you get us
information we need to...

639
00:39:08,269 --> 00:39:10,770
Bayler!

640
00:39:10,805 --> 00:39:13,172
Did I say "ask"?

641
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:15,675
I meant help us.

642
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:18,611
Or I go to your king
and tell him exactly how well

643
00:39:18,646 --> 00:39:20,713
I know his wife.

644
00:39:20,749 --> 00:39:22,882
Then I'll tell him myself.

645
00:39:22,917 --> 00:39:26,319
Word travels fast about the High King.

646
00:39:26,354 --> 00:39:28,321
Emotional.

647
00:39:28,356 --> 00:39:30,623
Easily wounded.

648
00:39:30,658 --> 00:39:33,126
Try it and see.

649
00:39:33,161 --> 00:39:35,895
Or help the cause.

650
00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:43,369
If the FU Fighters make another move,

651
00:39:43,405 --> 00:39:45,405
I'll kill you myself.

652
00:39:53,248 --> 00:39:55,782
That should do it.

653
00:39:55,817 --> 00:39:57,717
How are you feeling?

654
00:39:57,752 --> 00:40:03,423
Like I finally understand why
people take these kind of drugs.

655
00:40:03,458 --> 00:40:04,957
Okay, we'll start the procedure.

656
00:40:04,993 --> 00:40:06,059
You may feel some cramping,

657
00:40:06,094 --> 00:40:08,194
and that's perfectly normal.

658
00:40:21,076 --> 00:40:23,776
What... what's wrong?

659
00:40:23,812 --> 00:40:27,013
Morning cobwebs. Excuse me.

660
00:40:27,048 --> 00:40:30,383
- Just relax.
- Okay.

661
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:56,876
What are you doing?

662
00:41:02,083 --> 00:41:03,783
Wait.

663
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,986
Stop.

664
00:41:10,358 --> 00:41:11,991
- Stop it! Wait!
- I can't.

665
00:41:12,026 --> 00:41:13,793
Stop! What are you doing? No!

666
00:41:13,828 --> 00:41:14,794
Kady!

667
00:41:14,829 --> 00:41:16,195
Kady!

668
00:41:16,231 --> 00:41:17,864
Kady!

669
00:41:17,899 --> 00:41:21,100
- I can't...
- Stop!

670
00:41:30,945 --> 00:41:32,411
Oh, my God.

671
00:41:32,447 --> 00:41:35,882
Holy fuck.

672
00:41:35,917 --> 00:41:39,986
Oh, my...

673
00:41:40,021 --> 00:41:41,354
- Do it.
- What?

674
00:41:41,389 --> 00:41:43,055
Do it. You have wards.

675
00:41:43,091 --> 00:41:45,224
The thing, it got to her.
Just get it out of me, Kady.

676
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,526
Julia, that is a dead body.

677
00:41:46,561 --> 00:41:49,362
We need to get rid of it right now.

678
00:41:49,397 --> 00:41:51,197
Fuck, Jules.

679
00:41:51,232 --> 00:41:53,166
We will find another way.

680
