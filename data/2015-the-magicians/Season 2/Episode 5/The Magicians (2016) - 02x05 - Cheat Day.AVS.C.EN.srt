00:00:00,213 --> 00:00:01,320
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,926
You may address me
as Reynard the Fox,

3
00:00:02,962 --> 00:00:06,027
trickster of the faithful,
the very stupid.

4
00:00:09,344 --> 00:00:10,850
You must be Marina.

5
00:00:12,574 --> 00:00:15,408
I need you to tell me
about the thing that killed you.

6
00:00:15,443 --> 00:00:18,344
There was a girl.

7
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:22,181
40 years ago, she vanished
Reynard from Earth.

8
00:00:22,217 --> 00:00:24,350
<i>Charlie, my brother,
he was really, really good.</i>

9
00:00:24,385 --> 00:00:26,119
<i>You know that spell I did
on the first day of class</i>

10
00:00:26,154 --> 00:00:27,620
<i>with the glass horse?
He taught me that.</i>

11
00:00:27,655 --> 00:00:30,990
I fell for this professor.
He was married.

12
00:00:31,025 --> 00:00:34,360
I thought I could
make him love me again

13
00:00:34,395 --> 00:00:36,696
if I could make myself prettier.

14
00:00:36,731 --> 00:00:39,332
<i>I really believed he might
actually be able</i>

15
00:00:39,367 --> 00:00:40,933
<i>to undo what I did.</i>

16
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:44,036
It burned until he wasn't
there anymore.

17
00:00:44,072 --> 00:00:46,472
I gave up magic
and never looked back.

18
00:00:49,644 --> 00:00:51,644
No!

19
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:53,212
<i>Alice is gone.</i>

20
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,580
<i>There's a creature,</i>

21
00:00:54,616 --> 00:00:56,015
<i>she's called the White Lady.</i>

22
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:57,350
I want my hands back.

23
00:00:57,385 --> 00:00:59,552
No!

24
00:00:59,587 --> 00:01:02,054
Alice Quinn.
Bring her back to life.

25
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,256
I can't.

26
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:04,624
Is there nothing else
you desire?

27
00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:05,659
Send me home.

28
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,467
I spoke with Professor Lipson

29
00:01:14,502 --> 00:01:16,269
about the tests she ran.

30
00:01:16,304 --> 00:01:18,571
But I'm sorry to say that

31
00:01:18,606 --> 00:01:20,206
we don't even know
where to start.

32
00:01:20,241 --> 00:01:22,108
Okay, is this a normal candle
or what--

33
00:01:27,215 --> 00:01:28,514
Of course.

34
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,116
You cure your own hands
just fine, but mine,

35
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:31,517
you can't do
a fucking thing about, huh?

36
00:01:31,553 --> 00:01:36,422
Broken or not,
my hands are my hands.

37
00:01:36,457 --> 00:01:38,424
Yours are something else.

38
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:40,193
There's nothing we can do.

39
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:41,994
And Brakebills
continues its tradition

40
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,296
of fucking my shit.

41
00:01:43,331 --> 00:01:45,398
There's nothing we can do here.

42
00:01:45,433 --> 00:01:48,334
There are other options.

43
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:52,138
One, I send you to someone
who may know more.

44
00:01:52,173 --> 00:01:53,306
Yes. Who is it?

45
00:01:53,341 --> 00:01:54,607
Professor Mayakovsky.

46
00:01:54,642 --> 00:01:56,375
The drunk perv in the igloo?

47
00:01:56,411 --> 00:01:57,710
Pass.

48
00:01:57,745 --> 00:01:59,245
What's option two?

49
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,981
Hmm, well,
you won't have to worry

50
00:02:02,016 --> 00:02:04,116
about your hands
or magic at all.

51
00:02:04,152 --> 00:02:06,052
It's actually where
I sent Quentin.

52
00:02:06,087 --> 00:02:08,020
Where's Quentin?

53
00:02:19,701 --> 00:02:22,134
So we finally get
to the cashier and guess what.

54
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:26,005
- Hmm?
- I left my wallet in the car.

55
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,641
- Oh, man.
- Talk about bad timing.

56
00:02:28,676 --> 00:02:30,776
Yeah.

57
00:02:30,812 --> 00:02:33,279
Hey, does Donut House,
does that taste like donuts?

58
00:02:33,314 --> 00:02:35,348
I just use that thing for soup.

59
00:02:35,383 --> 00:02:37,783
Soup?

60
00:02:37,819 --> 00:02:39,819
What the fuck?

You know, dead or not,
Marina could have been

70
00:04:10,244 --> 00:04:11,677
a little more specific.

71
00:04:11,713 --> 00:04:14,513
I still don't know
what I'm looking for.

72
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:17,183
Look, banishing Reynard had to
take an insane amount of energy.

73
00:04:17,218 --> 00:04:21,320
So any sort of strange event
or operation.

74
00:04:21,356 --> 00:04:24,357
Yeah, that's literally
the definition of "news."

75
00:04:24,392 --> 00:04:26,158
We'll know it when we see it.

00:04:42,643 --> 00:04:44,543
I need some fuel.

00:04:53,821 --> 00:04:55,988
Okay.

79
00:05:00,528 --> 00:05:01,894
You okay?

80
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:10,703
Is that the second time today?

81
00:05:10,738 --> 00:05:12,671
Third.

Oh, God, Jules, I--

84
00:05:26,421 --> 00:05:27,787
- Fuck!
- Hey.

85
00:05:27,822 --> 00:05:29,555
- Fuck.
- Hey, come on, come on.

86
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,690
- Hey, sit.
- Why?

87
00:05:31,726 --> 00:05:33,826
Why won't it just end?

88
00:05:33,861 --> 00:05:36,862
Why does it just keep getting
worse and worse?

89
00:05:36,898 --> 00:05:38,631
I'm so sorry.

90
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,699
Whatever's--
what's the spell

91
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,601
to terminate it or whatever?

92
00:05:42,637 --> 00:05:44,336
I mean, there's stuff out
there, but it's all shady,

93
00:05:44,372 --> 00:05:47,540
Dark Ages shit from before
modern medicine.

94
00:05:47,575 --> 00:05:49,708
You don't cauterize a paper cut

95
00:05:49,744 --> 00:05:51,877
with a crazy,
medieval blowtorch.

96
00:05:51,913 --> 00:05:54,613
Sounds like exactly
what I wanna do.

97
00:05:54,649 --> 00:05:56,749
Not if it erases
your uterus and kidneys

98
00:05:56,784 --> 00:05:58,717
along with the fetus.

99
00:05:58,753 --> 00:06:00,419
Jesus.

100
00:06:00,455 --> 00:06:03,689
Hey, it's--it's okay.

101
00:06:03,724 --> 00:06:07,560
Jules, this is a simple,
totally mundane procedure.

102
00:06:07,595 --> 00:06:09,895
Is it? 'Cause it might not
be a simple,

103
00:06:09,931 --> 00:06:11,730
totally mundane human embryo.

104
00:06:11,766 --> 00:06:13,933
I mean--

105
00:06:13,968 --> 00:06:17,703
I don't even know if it's
Reynard's or Richard's.

106
00:06:17,738 --> 00:06:22,575
Right now, it is just
a clump of cells.

107
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:26,245
Okay, so, let's just
put a pin in all this, okay?

108
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,280
We'll make an appointment.

109
00:06:36,023 --> 00:06:39,391
Your Majesty.
It's ready.

110
00:06:39,427 --> 00:06:42,761
At the very least, I hope you
solved the carbonation issue.

111
00:06:42,797 --> 00:06:47,032
We had to dump that last glass
in another world, you know.

112
00:06:47,068 --> 00:06:49,001
Still bubbling.

113
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,009
Oh, the miles we must walk.

114
00:06:57,044 --> 00:07:00,212
My King.
I have the best news.

115
00:07:00,248 --> 00:07:02,681
If that rabbit
was a prosecco, I'd agree.

116
00:07:02,717 --> 00:07:04,950
This isn't just a rabbit.

117
00:07:04,986 --> 00:07:07,686
- Pregnant.
- Jesus.

118
00:07:07,722 --> 00:07:09,522
We're going to be parents.

119
00:07:09,557 --> 00:07:11,857
That rabbit knows if you're--

120
00:07:11,893 --> 00:07:14,293
- Pregnant.
- Okay, okay.

121
00:07:17,298 --> 00:07:19,031
- You're not smiling.
- I'm sorry.

122
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:20,766
- It's just--you see--
- Pregnant.

123
00:07:20,801 --> 00:07:23,536
Okay, rabbit! Chill.

124
00:07:26,307 --> 00:07:27,973
Ah, ah! Where do you think
you're going?

125
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:30,309
It may suck all the moisture
from my tongue,

126
00:07:30,344 --> 00:07:33,846
but damned if I'm not going
to toast to this shit.

127
00:07:33,881 --> 00:07:37,683
To our violently attractive
progeny.

128
00:07:47,962 --> 00:07:49,995
Hey, yo!
Yo, let me down, okay?

129
00:07:50,031 --> 00:07:53,632
What the fuck is this shit?

130
00:07:53,668 --> 00:07:55,434
What do you want?

131
00:07:55,469 --> 00:07:57,870
My hands can't
cast spells anymore.

132
00:07:57,905 --> 00:08:02,441
This is not Mayakovsy's Home
for Magically Inert.

133
00:08:02,476 --> 00:08:06,712
But maybe an exchange.

134
00:08:06,747 --> 00:08:08,380
What do you got in mind?

135
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,482
I'm in the middle of project.

136
00:08:10,518 --> 00:08:13,686
Help me, I do what I can.

137
00:08:16,591 --> 00:08:18,657
- I'm in.
- Okay.

138
00:08:26,801 --> 00:08:28,601
Is everybody out here
really so lifeless?

139
00:08:28,636 --> 00:08:32,438
Yes. We are, we are.
That's why we drink.

140
00:08:32,473 --> 00:08:33,939
Well, I drink just fine
as a Magician.

141
00:08:33,975 --> 00:08:36,108
Yeah, because your world
was so overwhelming and scary

142
00:08:36,143 --> 00:08:37,643
and you needed a break
from it all.

143
00:08:37,678 --> 00:08:38,844
Now you're gonna drink

144
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:40,346
because each day
is so goddamn dull

145
00:08:40,381 --> 00:08:43,616
and that takes a lot more booze.

146
00:08:43,651 --> 00:08:44,917
You ever cast anymore?

147
00:08:44,952 --> 00:08:46,151
God, no.

148
00:08:46,187 --> 00:08:47,653
Sorry, that was stupid.

149
00:08:47,688 --> 00:08:49,722
No, it's okay.

150
00:08:49,757 --> 00:08:51,023
I mean, nobody ever
gives up magic

151
00:08:51,058 --> 00:08:54,426
because everything's peachy.

152
00:08:54,462 --> 00:08:56,195
You wanna tell me?

153
00:09:02,536 --> 00:09:03,936
- Uh--
- I'm sorry.

154
00:09:03,971 --> 00:09:06,472
No. I shouldn't have asked.

155
00:09:06,507 --> 00:09:09,441
I can see that it's recent.

156
00:09:09,477 --> 00:09:12,511
It's fucking madness.

157
00:09:12,546 --> 00:09:15,381
Teaching that stuff to kids.
I mean...kids.

158
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,016
It's like, what's the point?
You know?

159
00:09:17,051 --> 00:09:18,951
'Cause it feels like for every
one thing that we fix,

160
00:09:18,986 --> 00:09:21,720
five shitty things
spring up in its place.

161
00:09:21,756 --> 00:09:24,023
Because each spell
is just another complication.

162
00:09:24,058 --> 00:09:25,858
That we cast
another spell to fix.

163
00:09:25,893 --> 00:09:27,926
Repeat, repeat, repeat.

164
00:09:27,962 --> 00:09:31,830
Until there's no spell left
and you're just--

165
00:09:31,866 --> 00:09:36,468
- you're left with--
- A big fucking problem.

166
00:09:39,106 --> 00:09:42,908
Oh, shit.
I have a meeting in 15.

167
00:09:42,943 --> 00:09:44,743
Ooh.

168
00:09:47,148 --> 00:09:49,014
I'm sorry.
That was just reflex.

169
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,584
Uh, that--I--um...

170
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,855
Just--just put this
on the company card.

171
00:09:56,891 --> 00:09:58,490
They won't notice.

172
00:10:00,928 --> 00:10:02,594
<i>I am happy.</i>

173
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,563
Yay, a baby.

174
00:10:04,598 --> 00:10:07,232
Eliot, what is this about?

175
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,204
I really wanna know.

176
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:16,608
My father was not the best...

177
00:10:16,644 --> 00:10:18,043
Wine, Your Majesty.

178
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,778
Bad dad.

179
00:10:19,814 --> 00:10:24,550
So I suppose I don't
exactly have the proper,

180
00:10:24,585 --> 00:10:26,552
uh, uh...

181
00:10:26,587 --> 00:10:28,120
template to--

182
00:10:28,155 --> 00:10:30,022
Ahh!

183
00:10:30,057 --> 00:10:32,257
Quiet!

184
00:10:32,293 --> 00:10:34,960
You are not welcome here,
child of Earth.

185
00:10:37,164 --> 00:10:38,263
Eliot!

186
00:10:47,608 --> 00:10:50,109
Wait.

187
00:10:50,144 --> 00:10:52,077
This is not over,
child of Earth.

188
00:10:56,684 --> 00:10:58,584
Dungeon.

189
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,921
What the hell was that about?

190
00:11:02,957 --> 00:11:06,058
I tried expressing my emotions.

191
00:11:06,093 --> 00:11:08,193
Lesson learned.

192
00:11:11,894 --> 00:11:16,364
Shittiest security ever.

193
00:11:16,882 --> 00:11:18,816
So what are we supposed to do?

194
00:11:18,851 --> 00:11:21,452
- Ship 'em back to Loria?
- Actually, Your Highness,

195
00:11:21,487 --> 00:11:23,220
he's not from Loria.

196
00:11:23,256 --> 00:11:24,922
He's a native Fillorian.

197
00:11:24,957 --> 00:11:27,524
My own people
are trying to kill me?

198
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,660
Hmm.
So French.

199
00:11:29,695 --> 00:11:32,429
They're commoners.
Not to worry.

200
00:11:32,465 --> 00:11:34,932
Oh, whoa, whoa.
I'm worried.

201
00:11:34,967 --> 00:11:38,235
I urge
a public execution, today.

202
00:11:38,271 --> 00:11:40,771
Might I suggest strangulation?

203
00:11:40,806 --> 00:11:42,339
For the symbolism.

204
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,707
We don't wish
to fall to his level.

205
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,976
The Bed of a Thousand Spikes
should do just fine.

206
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:55,352
Her Slowness suggests tying
each of his limbs to a centaur,

207
00:11:55,388 --> 00:11:58,289
and as they stretch him,
inch by inch,

208
00:11:58,324 --> 00:12:02,860
a fifth centaur sets the spike,
if you will.

209
00:12:02,895 --> 00:12:04,528
Jesus, no.

210
00:12:04,563 --> 00:12:07,398
Everyone out. This is a matter
for the Queen and me.

211
00:12:08,901 --> 00:12:11,935
That sloth is psychotic.

212
00:12:11,971 --> 00:12:14,471
It's all psychotic.

213
00:12:14,507 --> 00:12:16,907
Did you hear how Tick
said "commoners"?

214
00:12:16,942 --> 00:12:19,243
When we're the least snobby
people in a room,

215
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:21,612
there's something wrong
with the room.

216
00:12:28,788 --> 00:12:30,354
Yes?

217
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:32,856
I wanted to apologize.

218
00:12:32,892 --> 00:12:36,360
I'm sorry, um...

219
00:12:36,395 --> 00:12:37,995
Okay.

220
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,833
What?

221
00:12:42,868 --> 00:12:48,639
I just--I don't know
if you accepted my apology.

222
00:12:48,674 --> 00:12:51,875
Yes.

223
00:12:51,911 --> 00:12:54,578
- Okay.
- Actually, no.

224
00:12:54,613 --> 00:12:57,014
No, I don't.

225
00:12:57,049 --> 00:12:59,817
We had just talked about
how terrible magic is,

226
00:12:59,852 --> 00:13:02,286
and then you went and did it.

227
00:13:02,321 --> 00:13:04,588
It was just a tiny spell.

228
00:13:04,623 --> 00:13:06,390
There are a lot
of companies like this.

229
00:13:06,425 --> 00:13:08,659
I'm sure Fogg can find
another one for you.

230
00:13:12,498 --> 00:13:13,897
Okay.

231
00:13:31,484 --> 00:13:32,850
<i>They're useless, right?</i>

232
00:13:32,885 --> 00:13:36,820
Well, maybe not useless.

233
00:13:39,558 --> 00:13:42,393
You can still grab hold
of things, wave hello,

234
00:13:42,428 --> 00:13:44,094
rub away a lonely night.

235
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,496
Okay, but for magic?

236
00:13:45,531 --> 00:13:47,398
For magic? Useless.

237
00:13:49,802 --> 00:13:51,769
How was your travel?

238
00:13:51,804 --> 00:13:53,937
Fine.

239
00:13:53,973 --> 00:13:57,107
Aim's good. I just can't
take people with me.

240
00:13:57,143 --> 00:13:59,076
Some might call that blessing.

241
00:13:59,111 --> 00:14:01,612
Yeah, well the option
would be nice, so--

242
00:14:01,647 --> 00:14:03,547
I mean, can you help me?
What are we doing here?

243
00:14:03,582 --> 00:14:05,315
I can help you.

244
00:14:05,351 --> 00:14:08,452
But first, your end of deal.

245
00:14:18,497 --> 00:14:20,597
Take out all the knots.

246
00:14:22,902 --> 00:14:25,936
What the hell?

247
00:14:25,971 --> 00:14:30,140
- Ms. Wicker.
- Uh, Julia.

248
00:14:30,176 --> 00:14:33,577
The test was positive.

249
00:14:33,612 --> 00:14:36,113
If you'd like, we can
discuss your options.

250
00:14:36,148 --> 00:14:38,649
- I want an abortion.
- Okay.

251
00:14:38,684 --> 00:14:40,818
That's something that we can
perform here in office.

252
00:14:40,853 --> 00:14:43,921
Great. Uh, today?

253
00:14:43,956 --> 00:14:45,689
Unfortunately, we do have
a waiting list,

254
00:14:45,724 --> 00:14:47,424
but it should just be
a couple of days.

255
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,527
Days?

256
00:14:50,563 --> 00:14:53,163
Doctor, I can't wait
a couple of days.

257
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,666
Please, I--

258
00:14:57,603 --> 00:15:02,639
If I suspect abuse,
I'm obligated to report it.

259
00:15:02,675 --> 00:15:04,508
Julia, you're safe here.

260
00:15:04,543 --> 00:15:06,910
You can talk about
what happened.

261
00:15:06,946 --> 00:15:11,515
No one is above the law.

262
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,784
Ah, sorry.

263
00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:17,554
I wish that were true.

264
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:20,023
Look, I just want this
to be over,

265
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:23,527
and you can help me.

266
00:15:23,562 --> 00:15:26,463
Please.

267
00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:28,532
Okay.

268
00:15:28,567 --> 00:15:30,868
We'll set you up
for an ultrasound today.

269
00:15:30,903 --> 00:15:34,004
Tomorrow, you can perform
the procedure.

270
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:36,473
We open at 8:00.

271
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:39,610
- Thank you.
- See you then.

272
00:15:50,763 --> 00:15:51,696
Hi.

273
00:15:51,732 --> 00:15:53,131
Leave.

274
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:55,734
- You don't get to say that.
- And why not?

275
00:15:55,769 --> 00:15:58,036
Uh, because
you're in our castle.

276
00:15:58,071 --> 00:16:00,205
Which is on my land.

277
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,974
Uh, excuse me, my manners.

278
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,910
I'm Eliot, High King of Fillory.

279
00:16:04,945 --> 00:16:09,814
And I'm Bayler, a proud
soldier of Fillorians United.

280
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:12,083
A FU fighter.

281
00:16:12,119 --> 00:16:14,953
- Did you say, "Foo Fighter"?
- Margo, behave.

282
00:16:14,988 --> 00:16:18,290
We will not rest until a
Fillorian sits upon the throne.

283
00:16:18,325 --> 00:16:20,992
Okay, tell Ember.

284
00:16:21,028 --> 00:16:22,260
He issued the decree.

285
00:16:22,296 --> 00:16:25,197
We will execute
every child of Earth

286
00:16:25,232 --> 00:16:28,767
that crosses into our land until
there are none left to kill.

287
00:16:28,802 --> 00:16:31,670
And yet, you laugh.

288
00:16:33,907 --> 00:16:36,241
- I mean, a Foo Fighter?
- Margo.

289
00:16:36,276 --> 00:16:40,111
If we execute him,
then he's a martyr.

290
00:16:40,147 --> 00:16:42,147
Shit.

291
00:16:42,182 --> 00:16:44,115
When was the last time
either of us dealt with

292
00:16:44,151 --> 00:16:46,284
a political insurgency?

293
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,254
Unless getting kicked out
of a fivesome counts.

294
00:16:49,289 --> 00:16:50,922
- First for me.
- Same.

295
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,225
I'm thinking we should
probably bone up.

296
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,026
Like, study?

297
00:16:55,062 --> 00:16:56,962
I'll grab what I can from
the Brakebills Library.

298
00:16:56,997 --> 00:16:58,263
Fine.

299
00:16:58,298 --> 00:17:01,099
And grab some Adderall
while you're there.

300
00:17:09,643 --> 00:17:13,278
Okay, I'm done.

301
00:17:13,313 --> 00:17:15,914
Oh, shit! What?
Do not--don't--please--

302
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:17,649
don't sneak up on me like that.

303
00:17:17,684 --> 00:17:19,184
This is my house.

304
00:17:19,219 --> 00:17:21,052
Look, I finished untying
your bondage kit.

305
00:17:21,088 --> 00:17:22,254
You gonna teach me now?

306
00:17:22,289 --> 00:17:24,889
You finish first step.

307
00:17:24,925 --> 00:17:28,159
Next...the table.

308
00:17:30,897 --> 00:17:32,397
What about it?

309
00:17:32,432 --> 00:17:34,766
You make it sawdust.

310
00:17:34,801 --> 00:17:39,170
Do not worry.
I give you tool.

311
00:17:39,206 --> 00:17:41,239
Enjoy.

312
00:17:54,454 --> 00:17:57,455
What are you still doing here?

313
00:17:57,491 --> 00:17:59,391
I'm just finishing up.

314
00:17:59,426 --> 00:18:00,992
Gonna jerk it?

315
00:18:01,028 --> 00:18:02,861
- Break in the office?
- No.

316
00:18:02,896 --> 00:18:03,995
What? No, I'm--

317
00:18:04,031 --> 00:18:05,163
It's the only place I can.

318
00:18:05,198 --> 00:18:08,867
Wife and two kids?
No privacy at home.

319
00:18:08,902 --> 00:18:11,936
I'm not doing that...

320
00:18:11,972 --> 00:18:13,071
here.

321
00:18:13,106 --> 00:18:15,140
Just saying.
It's no judgment.

322
00:18:15,175 --> 00:18:17,809
Adios.

323
00:18:21,815 --> 00:18:25,283
I owe you an apology
for being a bitch.

324
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:28,019
Could you knock, please?

325
00:18:29,456 --> 00:18:31,423
What? Were you masturbating
in your office?

326
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,024
No!

327
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,093
Whatever. I do.

328
00:18:35,128 --> 00:18:36,961
What is this place?

329
00:18:41,335 --> 00:18:43,234
I'm sorry, again,
about the spell, I--

330
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,938
I'm sorry
for making you feel sorry.

331
00:18:46,973 --> 00:18:51,743
It was just a stupid spell.

332
00:18:51,778 --> 00:18:53,244
Thank you.

333
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,879
Want some?

334
00:18:54,915 --> 00:18:56,915
Vodka. Bit of lime.

335
00:19:01,955 --> 00:19:03,788
You should stay.

336
00:19:03,824 --> 00:19:04,989
Forget what I said earlier.

337
00:19:05,025 --> 00:19:09,361
I think we'd be good friends.

338
00:19:09,396 --> 00:19:11,896
I would like that.

339
00:19:11,932 --> 00:19:13,965
What the hell are we
still doing in the office?

340
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,368
Right?
Let's get out of here.

341
00:19:16,403 --> 00:19:17,736
- Mm.
- Finish that.

342
00:19:17,771 --> 00:19:19,804
- Come on.
- Okay.

343
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,339
Yes!

344
00:19:28,215 --> 00:19:29,948
Take a break.

345
00:19:31,451 --> 00:19:33,818
No trick, no test.
I promise.

346
00:19:42,295 --> 00:19:43,828
That's it?

347
00:19:43,864 --> 00:19:46,998
Take your balls out
of your purse and drink.

348
00:19:49,903 --> 00:19:51,936
No, if we're gonna talk
about what we did,

349
00:19:51,972 --> 00:19:53,304
then we have to call it
what it is.

350
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,240
It's stupid.
It's so fucking stupid.

351
00:19:55,275 --> 00:19:57,342
It's the stupidest
I've ever fucking been.

352
00:19:57,377 --> 00:19:59,544
Reynard set us up.

353
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:01,546
Yeah, but I should have
known better.

354
00:20:01,581 --> 00:20:05,450
You know, I knew the difference
between magic and miracles.

355
00:20:05,485 --> 00:20:09,354
One is real and one is
a lie with sparkles.

356
00:20:09,389 --> 00:20:13,992
Like a nice female god was
gonna glide in and save--

357
00:20:14,027 --> 00:20:16,961
It sounds so naive
to ever believe in that.

358
00:20:16,997 --> 00:20:19,531
Look, there is
one way through this,

359
00:20:19,566 --> 00:20:23,034
and that is to find out
what happened 40 years ago.

360
00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:24,969
Yeah, and banish the fuck
out of Reynard.

361
00:20:25,005 --> 00:20:28,440
Yeah, so let's just get this
pesky abortion out of the way,

362
00:20:28,475 --> 00:20:30,875
and that's next on the list.

363
00:20:30,911 --> 00:20:33,244
I know this is
a straightforward procedure.

364
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,281
It's probably, you know,
the simplest thing

365
00:20:36,316 --> 00:20:39,417
I've had to deal with in months.

366
00:20:39,453 --> 00:20:41,453
But I am nervous.

367
00:20:46,126 --> 00:20:48,593
I had one.

368
00:20:51,932 --> 00:20:54,265
He was a drummer.

369
00:20:56,303 --> 00:20:59,003
And he said he couldn't
get it up with a condom.

370
00:21:01,007 --> 00:21:02,941
But--

371
00:21:02,976 --> 00:21:07,378
I--I remember the night before.

372
00:21:07,414 --> 00:21:10,415
It--I felt...

373
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:14,319
I felt lonely.

374
00:21:17,257 --> 00:21:19,023
Yeah.

375
00:21:19,059 --> 00:21:21,893
But you're not alone.

376
00:21:21,928 --> 00:21:23,928
I'm your best bitch, remember?

377
00:21:26,533 --> 00:21:28,233
Yeah.

378
00:21:28,268 --> 00:21:31,603
Okay, your turn.
Truth or dare.

379
00:21:31,638 --> 00:21:34,439
Truth.

380
00:21:34,474 --> 00:21:36,407
Do you still blame yourself?

381
00:21:36,443 --> 00:21:39,143
Shit. Okay.

382
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:40,545
Sorry, no.

383
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,515
I think I'm drunker
than I think I am.

384
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,316
Was that a sentence?

385
00:21:45,352 --> 00:21:48,419
No, I said truth.

386
00:21:48,455 --> 00:21:52,657
So do you know what happened?

387
00:21:52,692 --> 00:21:54,259
I mean, just what Alice told me.

388
00:21:54,294 --> 00:21:58,096
That you changed your face
for a professor

389
00:21:58,131 --> 00:22:01,466
and it got screwed up
and Charlie tried to save you.

390
00:22:01,501 --> 00:22:03,535
Yeah, that's the gist.

391
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:07,305
How is Alice?

392
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,440
Uh, Alice is dead.

393
00:22:20,554 --> 00:22:23,221
I don't blame myself.

394
00:22:23,256 --> 00:22:26,958
Except for when
I first wake up...

395
00:22:26,993 --> 00:22:28,593
and when I go to bed

396
00:22:28,628 --> 00:22:33,464
and all the time in between.

397
00:22:37,737 --> 00:22:39,737
Your turn.

398
00:22:42,275 --> 00:22:44,108
Dare.

399
00:22:44,144 --> 00:22:45,777
Dare.

400
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:51,149
My dare is to smoke weed?

401
00:22:51,184 --> 00:22:53,518
It's very middle school.

402
00:22:56,489 --> 00:22:58,723
Oh, oh.

403
00:22:58,758 --> 00:23:01,125
Do you know--

404
00:23:01,161 --> 00:23:02,660
do you know Weizenheim's Third?

405
00:23:02,696 --> 00:23:05,296
It's a tiny, little
weather suspension spell.

406
00:23:05,332 --> 00:23:07,432
- I thought you didn't--
- I don't.

407
00:23:07,467 --> 00:23:09,133
This doesn't count.

408
00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:10,401
Today's a cheat day.

409
00:23:10,437 --> 00:23:13,237
Right.

410
00:23:13,273 --> 00:23:16,708
Oh, the trick to this one
is that you enchant your lips.

411
00:23:28,722 --> 00:23:31,723
- And you're a smoke artiste.
- Mm. Okay.

412
00:23:31,758 --> 00:23:33,124
Your turn.

413
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:34,592
Don't, like, burn yourself.

414
00:23:34,628 --> 00:23:36,628
- Okay, how do you do it?
- Oh, um...

415
00:23:36,663 --> 00:23:38,062
Okay, let me.

416
00:23:58,585 --> 00:24:00,551
You're a fucking dork.

417
00:24:00,587 --> 00:24:02,687
You're just jealous that
I'm such a quick study.

418
00:24:02,722 --> 00:24:05,690
Yeah.

419
00:24:05,725 --> 00:24:07,725
Okay.

420
00:24:16,569 --> 00:24:18,269
What is that?

421
00:24:18,304 --> 00:24:20,171
This one's my favorite.

422
00:24:29,382 --> 00:24:31,215
That's my favorite, too.

423
00:24:35,522 --> 00:24:37,188
- Ooh!
- Come on in.

424
00:24:37,223 --> 00:24:39,590
Okay.

425
00:24:39,626 --> 00:24:42,160
Emily Greenstreet,

426
00:24:42,195 --> 00:24:44,629
living the loft life, huh?

427
00:24:44,664 --> 00:24:46,698
Yeah.

428
00:24:46,733 --> 00:24:48,166
Wine opener?

429
00:24:48,201 --> 00:24:50,334
One of those drawers.
One of the--

430
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:52,704
Wine opener.

431
00:24:52,739 --> 00:24:55,640
Ahh, wine opener, wine opener.

432
00:24:55,675 --> 00:24:58,409
Hey.

433
00:24:58,445 --> 00:25:02,613
I wanna do a spell.

434
00:25:02,649 --> 00:25:04,415
Why don't we keep drinking

435
00:25:04,451 --> 00:25:08,553
and make some really,
really bad decisions?

436
00:25:08,588 --> 00:25:11,289
That sounds, I don't know,
kind of fun.

437
00:25:11,324 --> 00:25:15,093
Yeah. You'll like it.

438
00:25:15,128 --> 00:25:18,329
- Mm.
- Come on.

439
00:25:18,364 --> 00:25:20,164
Cheat day.

440
00:25:22,023 --> 00:25:23,473
The defenestration of Prague.

441
00:25:23,528 --> 00:25:24,627
No, you already said that.

442
00:25:24,663 --> 00:25:26,396
- There were two.
- Mm.

443
00:25:26,431 --> 00:25:28,398
Look, any hope you had
of saving this guy

444
00:25:28,433 --> 00:25:29,832
is out the window.

445
00:25:29,868 --> 00:25:32,223
Like the guys in Prague.

446
00:25:34,439 --> 00:25:35,905
Shit.

447
00:25:35,941 --> 00:25:41,611
Eliot, we said we'd do
whatever actually works.

448
00:25:41,646 --> 00:25:44,781
Fine. We'll tell the council
in the morning.

449
00:25:44,816 --> 00:25:45,982
But I'll do it.

450
00:25:46,017 --> 00:25:48,685
The man's life
is my burden to bear.

451
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,788
Get over yourself, Ned Stark.

452
00:25:54,526 --> 00:25:56,326
Ned Stark.

453
00:26:07,706 --> 00:26:09,973
Do you even like magic?

454
00:26:10,008 --> 00:26:12,475
Yeah, like...

455
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:16,813
Like I like money or food
or any other useful shit.

456
00:26:16,848 --> 00:26:19,515
Money and food
don't explode in your face.

457
00:26:19,551 --> 00:26:23,286
You came to Brakebills
only to ease your suffering.

458
00:26:23,321 --> 00:26:26,756
The voices.
It was all chore and burden.

459
00:26:26,791 --> 00:26:29,659
But you saved yourself,
traveler.

460
00:26:29,694 --> 00:26:32,462
Good.

461
00:26:32,497 --> 00:26:34,964
Maybe you're simply done.

462
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,968
Now's your chance.
Walk away.

463
00:26:39,004 --> 00:26:42,772
Why? Chance at what?

464
00:26:42,807 --> 00:26:46,376
Few years of happy life.

465
00:26:48,647 --> 00:26:53,716
There is bad surprise
in store for everyone.

466
00:26:53,752 --> 00:26:57,387
What surprise?

467
00:26:57,422 --> 00:27:01,891
Energy current
should be constant.

468
00:27:03,695 --> 00:27:08,564
But it's not.
Why?

469
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,800
There is something
happening to magic.

470
00:27:10,835 --> 00:27:13,336
The wellspring in Fillory.

471
00:27:13,371 --> 00:27:16,506
- The current is sputtering.
- And they're trying to fix it.

472
00:27:16,541 --> 00:27:18,808
Maybe it's going to disappear.

473
00:27:18,843 --> 00:27:21,477
- If that's the case...
- Shit could get real.

474
00:27:21,513 --> 00:27:25,615
If magic goes, it will be
very bad time to be Magician,

475
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:29,352
so consider the advantage
of getting out now.

476
00:27:29,387 --> 00:27:31,087
All right.
Okay, thank you.

477
00:27:31,122 --> 00:27:34,357
I'll meditate on it.
I...

478
00:27:34,392 --> 00:27:37,460
Right now, I'm staying.

479
00:27:37,495 --> 00:27:41,664
Then you're just fancy scarf
wrapped around an idiot.

480
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,133
You know what?
If it's so bad, you get out!

481
00:27:44,169 --> 00:27:46,936
You leave, I'll leave.

482
00:27:46,971 --> 00:27:50,139
I cannot leave.
Thanks for reminder.

483
00:27:50,175 --> 00:27:53,176
What--what,
you're trapped here?

484
00:27:53,211 --> 00:27:55,745
Remarkably like that.

485
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,847
Incorporate bond.

486
00:27:57,882 --> 00:27:59,916
Even I cannot break.

487
00:27:59,951 --> 00:28:01,818
Why?

488
00:28:01,853 --> 00:28:05,988
What did you do?

489
00:28:06,024 --> 00:28:08,791
I'm not drunk enough
to talk about it.

490
00:28:14,199 --> 00:28:18,601
Okay!

491
00:28:18,636 --> 00:28:20,703
I make love to many students.

492
00:28:20,739 --> 00:28:25,141
And then I fucked the wrong one.

493
00:28:25,176 --> 00:28:27,577
Oops.

494
00:28:27,612 --> 00:28:30,580
They sent you here?
God.

495
00:28:30,615 --> 00:28:32,115
It was that...

496
00:28:36,121 --> 00:28:39,088
Or give up magic.

497
00:28:39,124 --> 00:28:42,091
- Like you're telling me to.
- Yes.

498
00:28:42,127 --> 00:28:44,627
<i>I made my choice.</i>

499
00:28:59,878 --> 00:29:02,645
Wakey, wakey.

500
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,815
You have 15 minutes
to save your life.

501
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:09,018
Tell me, if you were in charge,

502
00:29:09,053 --> 00:29:12,155
how would the FU Fighters
fix Fillory?

503
00:29:13,825 --> 00:29:16,526
It's an illusion spell.

504
00:29:16,561 --> 00:29:18,027
Party trick, really.
It'll only last

505
00:29:18,062 --> 00:29:20,963
as long as your skin's wet.

506
00:29:20,999 --> 00:29:22,498
You first.

507
00:29:22,534 --> 00:29:25,735
Yeah. You know, this is
the weirdest foreplay.

508
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:27,904
Oh, my God. Stop.

509
00:29:27,939 --> 00:29:30,239
Robe off!

510
00:29:33,645 --> 00:29:36,512
Whoa, what is that?

511
00:29:36,548 --> 00:29:38,047
Oh, right, uh...

512
00:29:38,082 --> 00:29:39,582
You joined some kinda gang?

513
00:29:39,617 --> 00:29:41,517
Yes.

514
00:29:41,553 --> 00:29:42,885
Okay.

515
00:29:42,921 --> 00:29:45,621
Hop in.

516
00:30:10,615 --> 00:30:12,782
Did it work?

517
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,723
Oh, shit.

518
00:30:20,758 --> 00:30:22,291
Don't judge me, please.

519
00:30:22,327 --> 00:30:26,162
I'm not. I'm just
putting it all together.

520
00:30:26,197 --> 00:30:29,065
You, Charlie.

521
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,834
That's why he's
at Brakebills South.

522
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,169
I mean, I had a lot of theories.

523
00:30:33,204 --> 00:30:35,238
Shh.

524
00:30:35,273 --> 00:30:37,807
You're ruining it.

525
00:30:37,842 --> 00:30:42,311
Just tell me what you think
when you look at me.

526
00:30:42,347 --> 00:30:45,848
And can you maybe try
a Russian accent?

527
00:30:56,794 --> 00:31:00,129
You didn't wanna...

528
00:31:00,164 --> 00:31:02,365
This is what I miss the most.

529
00:31:07,372 --> 00:31:10,840
So...

530
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:12,642
your turn.

531
00:31:37,101 --> 00:31:40,202
It's her.

532
00:31:40,238 --> 00:31:41,938
It's your memories.

533
00:31:45,276 --> 00:31:49,178
Well?
Anything you wanna say?

534
00:31:51,316 --> 00:31:54,283
I just really fucking miss you.

535
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:48,999
What...

536
00:32:49,035 --> 00:32:53,270
- is that?
- Yeah.

537
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:55,739
Um, hey, I--
I've gotta get home.

538
00:32:55,775 --> 00:32:58,476
Um...

539
00:32:58,511 --> 00:33:00,411
I had a good time.

540
00:33:00,446 --> 00:33:02,913
You don't have to go.
We can do it again.

541
00:33:02,949 --> 00:33:04,515
You said yesterday
was cheat day.

542
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,383
You can't...

543
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:08,919
You can't cheat every day.

544
00:33:08,955 --> 00:33:11,655
I won't tell.

545
00:33:11,691 --> 00:33:15,359
No, I don't want to.

546
00:33:15,394 --> 00:33:17,595
So, what, you're...
done with me?

547
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:20,297
I--I was helping you.

548
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:22,032
That's not what I said.

549
00:33:22,068 --> 00:33:25,002
Tell me, then.
What are you saying?

550
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,407
Last night was...

551
00:33:33,713 --> 00:33:35,946
It felt really good,
and it was...

552
00:33:38,351 --> 00:33:41,919
Probably exactly what I needed,
but I...

553
00:33:41,954 --> 00:33:46,790
It was also really weird and sad
and I feel awful.

554
00:33:46,826 --> 00:33:50,628
I feel worse than before.

555
00:33:50,663 --> 00:33:52,663
Apologies for my terrible life.

556
00:33:56,068 --> 00:33:58,669
I just don't wanna
use magic like that.

557
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:06,076
I'm sorry for
everything you lost.

558
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,983
I'll see you at work.

559
00:34:20,993 --> 00:34:25,796
It is after much deliberation
that I have decided...

560
00:34:25,831 --> 00:34:27,765
we will not
execute the prisoner.

561
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,633
What?

562
00:34:29,669 --> 00:34:32,336
Your Majesty, I'm--

563
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:33,938
It is in Fillory's
best interest.

564
00:34:33,973 --> 00:34:37,374
We agreed to have the prisoner
executed today.

565
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:40,077
We did.
But I changed my mind.

566
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:44,648
Well, I didn't.

567
00:34:44,684 --> 00:34:45,950
And I'm High Queen.

568
00:34:45,985 --> 00:34:47,885
The Queen may voice her opinion,

569
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,689
but ultimate judgment
belongs to the King.

570
00:34:51,724 --> 00:34:56,393
So this is what
the patriarchy smells like?

571
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:58,462
It's not the freshest.

572
00:35:00,733 --> 00:35:03,033
You are a king.
Act like it.

573
00:35:03,069 --> 00:35:06,036
I'm not just a king.

574
00:35:06,072 --> 00:35:07,805
Fen's pregnant.

575
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,741
I'm gonna be a father.

576
00:35:12,378 --> 00:35:15,446
Mm.

577
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:17,581
And I would like
to raise my child

578
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:22,753
in a world that does not just
kill its problems away.

579
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:27,391
We hear them and we
address them accordingly.

580
00:35:27,426 --> 00:35:29,593
That is fucking stupid.

581
00:35:29,629 --> 00:35:31,929
You wanna rule a kingdom?
Guess what.

582
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:35,799
People are gonna die
no matter what.

583
00:35:35,835 --> 00:35:38,502
Just trying to make sure
that it isn't you, okay?

584
00:35:47,146 --> 00:35:48,879
<i>Julia, I'll check you in.</i>

585
00:35:48,914 --> 00:35:50,648
<i>Dr. Higgins will be
ready shortly.</i>

586
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:54,051
Okay.

587
00:36:07,967 --> 00:36:09,800
I'm sorry, you're not in here.

588
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:11,001
Excuse me?

589
00:36:11,037 --> 00:36:13,070
You don't have an appointment.

590
00:36:13,105 --> 00:36:15,673
The doctor gave me one.
I mean, there must be a mistake.

591
00:36:15,708 --> 00:36:18,008
I'm sorry, but without an
appointment, I can't let you in.

592
00:36:18,044 --> 00:36:20,577
Look, it's Wicker.
Julia Wicker.

593
00:36:20,613 --> 00:36:22,112
You just said my name
two seconds ago.

594
00:36:22,148 --> 00:36:23,981
Can you just pick up the phone
and ask her?

595
00:36:28,654 --> 00:36:31,588
Doctor, there's a woman
claiming she's a patient.

596
00:36:31,624 --> 00:36:32,890
No, she doesn't.

597
00:36:32,925 --> 00:36:36,026
Uh, Julia Wicker.

598
00:36:36,062 --> 00:36:38,028
But, Doctor--

599
00:36:38,064 --> 00:36:40,964
Okay.

600
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,967
- You can go ahead.
- Yeah, thanks.

601
00:36:44,003 --> 00:36:46,770
I'll be right here.

602
00:36:57,708 --> 00:37:00,977
No geese!

603
00:37:01,012 --> 00:37:03,012
Oh.

604
00:37:03,047 --> 00:37:05,648
Phew.

605
00:37:05,683 --> 00:37:08,084
You finish table.
Good work.

606
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:10,953
Yeah, so can we get to this?

607
00:37:10,989 --> 00:37:13,623
Enough "Karate Kid" bullshit.

608
00:37:13,658 --> 00:37:15,758
Not bullshit.

609
00:37:17,996 --> 00:37:20,596
Ask yourself a question:

610
00:37:20,632 --> 00:37:24,167
What will a Magician need
if dark days come?

611
00:37:24,202 --> 00:37:26,569
Answer: magic.

612
00:37:26,604 --> 00:37:28,004
But if it is gone,
it is gone, you say.

613
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:31,774
Not so, if you store it
like a battery.

614
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:33,976
That's what I am building.

615
00:37:41,853 --> 00:37:43,619
Those knots?

616
00:37:43,655 --> 00:37:46,155
Old class project,
tied with magic.

617
00:37:46,191 --> 00:37:50,193
That table, stained
through with magic.

618
00:37:50,228 --> 00:37:55,097
You release the energy,
I store it for rainy day.

619
00:37:55,133 --> 00:37:59,402
So my hands, are you
gonna teach me or what?

620
00:37:59,437 --> 00:38:02,605
You can travel to Fillory.

621
00:38:04,909 --> 00:38:07,076
It's the worst place
in the universe, yeah.

622
00:38:07,111 --> 00:38:10,646
You go there.
Get this.

623
00:38:10,682 --> 00:38:12,949
Moss. You need moss.

624
00:38:12,984 --> 00:38:15,651
It's amazing.
Can carry current.

625
00:38:15,687 --> 00:38:19,755
Do not care.

626
00:38:22,227 --> 00:38:24,927
I'll get it.

627
00:38:32,237 --> 00:38:34,503
Gods, it's good to see you.

628
00:38:34,539 --> 00:38:35,872
You asshole!

629
00:38:35,907 --> 00:38:37,673
You come here with no warning

630
00:38:37,709 --> 00:38:39,175
and try to kill my husband.

631
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:41,577
Of course I did.

632
00:38:41,613 --> 00:38:43,546
I thought you were waiting.

633
00:38:43,581 --> 00:38:45,548
I'm not a FU Fighter anymore.

634
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:47,516
You always knew
that one day I'd have to--

635
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:51,053
Marry him, yes, and then
you'd be here, on the inside.

636
00:38:51,089 --> 00:38:55,524
You can't tell me that you don't
care about Fillory anymore.

637
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,260
I'm pregnant.

638
00:39:00,965 --> 00:39:03,165
- Then for the child.
- What?

639
00:39:03,201 --> 00:39:05,134
All I ask is you get us
information we need to--

640
00:39:05,169 --> 00:39:07,670
Bayler!

641
00:39:07,705 --> 00:39:10,072
Did I say "ask"?

642
00:39:10,108 --> 00:39:12,575
I meant help us.

643
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:15,511
Or I go to your king
and tell him exactly how well

644
00:39:15,546 --> 00:39:17,613
I know his wife.

645
00:39:17,649 --> 00:39:19,782
Then I'll tell him myself.

646
00:39:19,817 --> 00:39:23,219
Word travels fast
about the High King.

647
00:39:23,254 --> 00:39:25,221
Emotional.

648
00:39:25,256 --> 00:39:27,523
Easily wounded.

649
00:39:27,558 --> 00:39:30,026
Try it and see.

650
00:39:30,061 --> 00:39:32,795
Or help the cause.

651
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,269
If the FU Fighters
make another move,

652
00:39:40,305 --> 00:39:42,305
I'll kill you myself.

653
00:39:50,148 --> 00:39:52,682
That should do it.

654
00:39:52,717 --> 00:39:54,617
How are you feeling?

655
00:39:54,652 --> 00:40:00,323
Like I finally understand why
people take these kind of drugs.

656
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:01,857
Okay, we'll start the procedure.

657
00:40:01,893 --> 00:40:02,959
You may feel some cramping,

658
00:40:02,994 --> 00:40:05,094
and that's perfectly normal.

659
00:40:17,976 --> 00:40:20,676
What--what's wrong?

660
00:40:20,712 --> 00:40:23,913
Morning cobwebs.
Excuse me.

661
00:40:23,948 --> 00:40:27,283
- Just relax.
- Okay.

662
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,776
What are you doing?

663
00:40:58,983 --> 00:41:00,683
Wait.

664
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,886
Stop.

665
00:41:07,258 --> 00:41:08,891
- Stop it! Wait!
- I can't.

666
00:41:08,926 --> 00:41:10,693
Stop!
What are you doing? No!

667
00:41:10,728 --> 00:41:11,694
Kady!

668
00:41:11,729 --> 00:41:13,095
Kady!

669
00:41:13,131 --> 00:41:14,764
Kady!

670
00:41:14,799 --> 00:41:18,000
- I can't...
- Stop!

671
00:41:27,845 --> 00:41:29,311
Oh, my God.

672
00:41:29,347 --> 00:41:32,782
Holy fuck.

673
00:41:32,817 --> 00:41:36,886
Oh, my--

674
00:41:36,921 --> 00:41:38,254
- Do it.
- What?

675
00:41:38,289 --> 00:41:39,955
Do it. You have wards.

676
00:41:39,991 --> 00:41:42,124
The thing, it got to her.
Just get it out of me, Kady.

677
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,426
Julia, that is a dead body.

678
00:41:43,461 --> 00:41:46,262
We need to get rid of it
right now.

679
00:41:46,297 --> 00:41:48,097
Fuck, Jules.

680
00:41:48,132 --> 00:41:50,066
We will find another way.
