1
00:00:01,401 --> 00:00:03,769
<i>- Previously on
"the magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:03,771 --> 00:00:05,337
- You may address me
as Reynard the fox,

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,406
trickster of the faithful,
the very stupid.

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,543
- You must be Marina.

5
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:16,215
- I need you to tell me
about the thing that killed you.

6
00:00:16,217 --> 00:00:19,151
- There was a girl.

7
00:00:19,153 --> 00:00:22,654
40 years ago, she vanished
Reynard from earth.

8
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:24,757
<i>- Charlie, my brother,
he was really, really good.</i>

9
00:00:24,759 --> 00:00:26,592
<i>You know that spell I did
on the first day of class</i>

10
00:00:26,594 --> 00:00:28,360
<i>with the glass horse?
He taught me that.</i>

11
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:31,497
- I fell for this professor.
- He was married.

12
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:35,134
I thought I could
make him love me again

13
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:37,403
if I could make myself prettier.

14
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:40,105
<i>I really believed he might
actually be able</i>

15
00:00:40,107 --> 00:00:41,440
<i>to undo what I did.</i>

16
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:44,510
It burned until he wasn't
there anymore.

17
00:00:44,512 --> 00:00:47,379
I gave up magic
and never looked back.

18
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:52,518
- No!

19
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,819
<i>Alice is gone.</i>

20
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:55,320
<i>There's a creature,</i>

21
00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:56,655
<i>she's called the white lady.</i>

22
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:58,257
- I want my hands back.

23
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:00,259
No!

24
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:02,728
- Alice Quinn.
- Bring her back to life.

25
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,129
- I can't.

26
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:05,531
Is there nothing else
you desire?

27
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:06,565
- Send me home.

28
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:15,274
- I spoke with professor Lipson

29
00:01:15,276 --> 00:01:17,109
about the tests she ran.

30
00:01:17,111 --> 00:01:19,344
But I'm sorry to say that

31
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:20,846
we don't even know
where to start.

32
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:23,148
- Okay, is this a normal candle
or what...

33
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:29,288
Of course.

34
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,622
You cure your own hands
just fine, but mine,

35
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,291
you can't do
a fucking thing about, huh?

36
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:37,196
- Broken or not,
my hands are my hands.

37
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:39,198
Yours are something else.

38
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,833
There's nothing we can do.

39
00:01:40,835 --> 00:01:42,668
- And Brakebills
continues its tradition

40
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,103
of fucking my shit.

41
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:46,171
- There's nothing
we can do here.

42
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:49,141
There are other options.

43
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:52,778
One, I send you to someone
who may know more.

44
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,113
- Yes. Who is it?

45
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:55,347
- Professor Mayakovsky.

46
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:57,316
- The drunk perv in the igloo?

47
00:01:57,318 --> 00:01:58,584
Pass.

48
00:01:58,586 --> 00:01:59,852
What's option two?

49
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:02,721
- Hmm, well,
you won't have to worry

50
00:02:02,723 --> 00:02:04,623
about your hands
or magic at all.

51
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,725
It's actually where
I sent Quentin.

52
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:08,694
- Where's Quentin?

53
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,641
- So we finally get
to the cashier and guess what.

54
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:26,545
- Hmm?
- I left my wallet in the car.

55
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:29,581
- Oh, man.
- Talk about bad timing.

56
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,517
- Yeah.

57
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,919
Hey, does donut house,
does that taste like donuts?

58
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:36,188
- I just use that thing
for soup.

59
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,657
- Soup?

60
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,692
What the fuck?

61
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:41,920
- Hello?

62
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:45,390
Professor Mayakovsky?

63
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:53,966
Shh...

64
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:56,702
Hey! Hey, let me down!

65
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:58,937
I'm a student!

66
00:04:02,476 --> 00:04:03,842
Dick.

67
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,648
- "Chicago register."
July '76.

68
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,916
- You know, dead or not,
Marina could have been

69
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,484
a little more specific.

70
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:14,987
I still don't know
what I'm looking for.

71
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:17,889
- Look, banishing Reynard had to
take an insane amount of energy.

72
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:21,827
So any sort of strange event
or operation.

73
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:24,997
- Yeah, that's literally
the definition of "news."

74
00:04:24,999 --> 00:04:26,865
- We'll know it when we see it.

75
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:45,517
I need some fuel.

76
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:56,828
Okay.

77
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:02,834
You okay?

78
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,677
- Is that the second time today?

79
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:13,645
- Third.

80
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:24,022
- Here.

81
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:27,059
Oh, god, Jules, I...

82
00:05:27,061 --> 00:05:28,560
- Fuck!
- Hey.

83
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:30,395
- Fuck.
- Hey, come on, come on.

84
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:32,497
- Hey, sit.
- Why?

85
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,599
Why won't it just end?

86
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:37,803
Why does it just keep getting
worse and worse?

87
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:39,438
- I'm so sorry.

88
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,506
- Whatever's...
- What's the spell

89
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:43,075
to terminate it or whatever?

90
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:45,010
- I mean, there's stuff out
there, but it's all shady,

91
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:48,380
dark ages shit from before
modern medicine.

92
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:50,515
You don't cauterize a paper cut

93
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,651
with a crazy,
medieval blowtorch.

94
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:55,454
- Sounds like exactly
what I wanna do.

95
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:57,689
- Not if it erases
your uterus and kidneys

96
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,658
along with the fetus.

97
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,059
- Jesus.

98
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:04,529
- Hey, it's... it's okay.

99
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:08,433
Jules, this is a simple,
totally mundane procedure.

100
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:10,702
- Is it? 'Cause it might not
be a simple,

101
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,704
totally mundane human embryo.

102
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,706
I mean...

103
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:18,543
I don't even know if it's
Reynard's or Richard's.

104
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:23,448
- Right now, it is just
a clump of cells.

105
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:26,985
Okay, so, let's just
put a pin in all this, okay?

106
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:28,987
We'll make an appointment.

107
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:39,898
- Your majesty.
- It's ready.

108
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:43,568
- At the very least, I hope you
solved the carbonation issue.

109
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,939
We had to dump that last glass
in another world, you know.

110
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,908
Still bubbling.

111
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:57,749
Oh, the miles we must walk.

112
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:00,752
- My king.
- I have the best news.

113
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,555
- If that rabbit
was a prosecco, I'd agree.

114
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:05,891
- This isn't just a rabbit.

115
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:08,527
- Pregnant.
- Jesus.

116
00:07:08,529 --> 00:07:10,195
- We're going to be parents.

117
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:12,664
- That rabbit knows if you're...

118
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:15,000
- Pregnant.
- Okay, okay.

119
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,805
- You're not smiling.
- I'm sorry.

120
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,606
- It's just... you see...
- pregnant.

121
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,576
- Okay, rabbit! Chill.

122
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:28,780
Ah, ah! Where do you think
you're going?

123
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:30,882
It may suck all the moisture
from my tongue,

124
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:34,653
but damned if I'm not going
to toast to this shit.

125
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:38,723
To our violently attractive
progeny.

126
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,769
- Hey, yo!
- Yo, let me down, okay?

127
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:54,473
What the fuck is this shit?

128
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:55,941
- What do you want?

129
00:07:55,943 --> 00:07:58,677
- My hands can't
cast spells anymore.

130
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:03,181
- This is not Mayakovsy's home
for magically inert.

131
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:07,586
But maybe an exchange.

132
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:09,120
- What do you got in mind?

133
00:08:09,122 --> 00:08:11,223
- I'm in the middle of project.

134
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:14,759
Help me, I do what I can.

135
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,698
- I'm in.
- Okay.

136
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,274
- Is everybody out here
really so lifeless?

137
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:32,978
- Yes. We are, we are.
- That's why we drink.

138
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,746
- Well, I drink just fine
as a magician.

139
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:36,882
- Yeah, because your world
was so overwhelming and scary

140
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:38,517
and you needed a break
from it all.

141
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,684
Now you're gonna drink

142
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:41,086
because each day
is so goddamn dull

143
00:08:41,088 --> 00:08:44,289
and that takes a lot more booze.

144
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,891
- You ever cast anymore?

145
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:47,058
- God, no.

146
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,293
- Sorry, that was stupid.

147
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:50,562
- No, it's okay.

148
00:08:50,564 --> 00:08:51,796
I mean, nobody ever
gives up magic

149
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:55,133
because everything's peachy.

150
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:57,068
You wanna tell me?

151
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:04,776
- Uh...
- I'm sorry.

152
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:07,212
No. I shouldn't have asked.

153
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:10,181
I can see that it's recent.

154
00:09:10,183 --> 00:09:13,251
It's fucking madness.

155
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:15,987
Teaching that stuff to kids.
I mean... Kids.

156
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:17,856
- It's like, what's the point?
- You know?

157
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:19,758
'Cause it feels like for every
one thing that we fix,

158
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,594
five shitty things
spring up in its place.

159
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:24,829
- Because each spell
is just another complication.

160
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:26,698
- That we cast
another spell to fix.

161
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,767
- Repeat, repeat, repeat.

162
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:32,671
- Until there's no spell left
and you're just...

163
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:37,175
- You're left with...
- a big fucking problem.

164
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:43,915
Oh, shit.
I have a meeting in 15.

165
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,617
- Ooh.

166
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,021
I'm sorry.
That was just reflex.

167
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:53,091
Uh, that... I... um...

168
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:57,662
- Just... just put this
on the company card.

169
00:09:57,664 --> 00:09:59,197
They won't notice.

170
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:03,268
<i>- I am happy.</i>

171
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,236
Yay, a baby.

172
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:08,139
- Eliot, what is this about?

173
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,944
I really wanna know.

174
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:17,282
My father was not the best...

175
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:18,984
- Wine, your majesty.

176
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:20,251
- Bad dad.

177
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:25,223
So I suppose I don't
exactly have the proper,

178
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:27,225
uh, uh...

179
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,860
Template to...

180
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:30,962
Ahh!

181
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,964
- Quiet!

182
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,900
You are not welcome here,
child of earth.

183
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:39,137
- Eliot!

184
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:50,849
- Wait.

185
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:52,984
- This is not over,
child of earth.

186
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,224
- Dungeon.

187
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,728
- What the hell was that about?

188
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,998
- I tried expressing
my emotions.

189
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,167
Lesson learned.

190
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:17,375
- Shittiest security ever.

191
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:19,344
- So what are we supposed to do?

192
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:22,047
- Ship 'em back to Loria?
- Actually, your highness,

193
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:23,882
he's not from Loria.

194
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:25,417
- He's a native Fillorian.

195
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:28,119
- My own people
are trying to kill me?

196
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:30,255
Hmm.
So French.

197
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:33,024
- They're commoners.
- Not to worry.

198
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,427
- Oh, whoa, whoa.
- I'm worried.

199
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:38,697
- I urge
a public execution, today.

200
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:41,299
- Might I suggest strangulation?

201
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:42,767
For the symbolism.

202
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:44,235
- We don't wish
to fall to his level.

203
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:46,805
The bed of a thousand spikes
should do just fine.

204
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:55,947
- Her slowness suggests tying
each of his limbs to a centaur,

205
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:58,750
and as they stretch him,
inch by inch,

206
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:03,788
a fifth centaur sets the spike,
if you will.

207
00:12:03,790 --> 00:24:07,578
- Jesus, no.

208
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:08,159
Everyone out. This is a matter
for the queen and me.

209
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,464
- That sloth is psychotic.

210
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:15,066
- It's all psychotic.

211
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,435
Did you hear how tick
said "commoners"?

212
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:19,738
- When we're the least snobby
people in a room,

213
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,207
there's something wrong
with the room.

214
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:30,982
- Yes?

215
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:33,785
- I wanted to apologize.

216
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:36,988
I'm sorry, um...

217
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,857
- Okay.

218
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,361
What?

219
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:49,200
- I just... I don't know
if you accepted my apology.

220
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:52,370
- Yes.

221
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:55,140
- Okay.
- Actually, no.

222
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:57,509
No, I don't.

223
00:12:57,511 --> 00:13:00,378
We had just talked about
how terrible magic is,

224
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,981
and then you went and did it.

225
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:05,216
- It was just a tiny spell.

226
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:06,885
- There are a lot
of companies like this.

227
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:09,420
I'm sure Fogg can find
another one for you.

228
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:14,793
- Okay.

229
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:33,411
<i>- They're useless, right?</i>

230
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:37,515
- Well, maybe not useless.

231
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:43,021
You can still grab hold
of things, wave hello,

232
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:44,956
rub away a lonely night.

233
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,090
- Okay, but for magic?

234
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:47,992
- For magic? Useless.

235
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,463
How was your travel?

236
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,465
- Fine.

237
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:57,569
Aim's good. I just can't
take people with me.

238
00:13:57,571 --> 00:13:59,571
- Some might call that blessing.

239
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:02,073
- Yeah, well the option
would be nice, so...

240
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:04,175
I mean, can you help me?
What are we doing here?

241
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,010
- I can help you.

242
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:09,280
But first, your end of deal.

243
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,392
Take out all the knots.

244
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:26,464
- What the hell?

245
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:31,002
- Ms. wicker.
- Uh, Julia.

246
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:34,038
- The test was positive.

247
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,608
If you'd like, we can
discuss your options.

248
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,077
- I want an abortion.
- Okay.

249
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:41,379
That's something that we can
perform here in office.

250
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:44,482
- Great. Uh, today?

251
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,284
- Unfortunately, we do have
a waiting list,

252
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:48,086
but it should just be
a couple of days.

253
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:50,989
- Days?

254
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:53,992
Doctor, I can't wait
a couple of days.

255
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:56,427
Please, I...

256
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:03,268
- if I suspect abuse,
I'm obligated to report it.

257
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,169
Julia, you're safe here.

258
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:07,505
You can talk about
what happened.

259
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:12,176
No one is above the law.

260
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:14,379
Ah, sorry.

261
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:18,216
I wish that were true.

262
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:20,952
Look, I just want this
to be over,

263
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:24,222
and you can help me.

264
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:27,125
Please.

265
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:28,993
- Okay.

266
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:31,429
We'll set you up
for an ultrasound today.

267
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,699
Tomorrow, you can perform
the procedure.

268
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:37,135
We open at 8:00.

269
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:40,371
- Thank you.
- See you then.

270
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:54,218
. - Hi.

271
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,553
- Leave.

272
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:58,256
- You don't get to say that.
- And why not?

273
00:15:58,258 --> 00:16:00,525
- Uh, because
you're in our castle.

274
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:02,660
- Which is on my land.

275
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:05,463
- Uh, excuse me, my manners.

276
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,265
I'm Eliot, high king of Fillory.

277
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:12,337
- And I'm Bayler, a proud
soldier of fillorians united.

278
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:14,572
A FU fighter.

279
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:17,308
- Did you say, "foo fighter"?
- Margo, behave.

280
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:21,079
- We will not rest until a
Fillorian sits upon the throne.

281
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:23,481
- Okay, tell Ember.

282
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,716
He issued the decree.

283
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:27,652
- We will execute
every child of earth

284
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:31,322
that crosses into our land until
there are none left to kill.

285
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:34,392
And yet, you laugh.

286
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,663
- I mean, a foo fighter?
- Margo.

287
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:42,734
If we execute him,
then he's a martyr.

288
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:44,602
- Shit.

289
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:46,571
When was the last time
either of us dealt with

290
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:48,706
a political insurgency?

291
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,676
- Unless getting kicked out
of a fivesome counts.

292
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,244
- First for me.
- Same.

293
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:56,014
I'm thinking we should
probably bone up.

294
00:16:56,016 --> 00:33:52,300
- Like, study?

295
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:59,450
- I'll grab what I can from
the Brakebills library.

296
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:00,752
- Fine.

297
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:03,755
And grab some Adderall
while you're there.

298
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,733
- Okay, I'm done.

299
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:18,436
Oh, shit! What?
Do not... don't... please...

300
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:20,238
Don't sneak up on me like that.

301
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,639
- This is my house.

302
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:23,541
- Look, I finished untying
your bondage kit.

303
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,076
You gonna teach me now?

304
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:27,412
- You finish first step.

305
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:30,782
Next... The table.

306
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,186
- What about it?

307
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:37,321
- You make it sawdust.

308
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:41,793
Do not worry.
I give you tool.

309
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:43,828
Enjoy.

310
00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:00,211
- What are you still doing here?

311
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:02,213
- I'm just finishing up.

312
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:03,548
- Gonna jerk it?

313
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,416
- Break in the office?
- No.

314
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,551
What? No, I'm...

315
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:07,685
- it's the only place I can.

316
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:11,422
Wife and two kids?
No privacy at home.

317
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,459
- I'm not doing that...

318
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:15,560
Here.

319
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:17,795
- Just saying.
- It's no judgment.

320
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:20,364
Adios.

321
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:27,738
- I owe you an apology
for being a bitch.

322
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,708
- Could you knock, please?

323
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:34,212
- What? Were you masturbating
in your office?

324
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:35,546
- No!

325
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:37,582
- Whatever. I do.

326
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:39,517
- What is this place?

327
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:45,723
- I'm sorry, again,
about the spell, I...

328
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:49,460
- I'm sorry
for making you feel sorry.

329
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:54,298
It was just a stupid spell.

330
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,867
- Thank you.

331
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:57,401
- Want some?

332
00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:59,570
Vodka. Bit of lime.

333
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,377
You should stay.

334
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:07,545
Forget what I said earlier.

335
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:12,216
I think we'd be good friends.

336
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:14,352
- I would like that.

337
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:16,521
- What the hell are we
still doing in the office?

338
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:18,856
Right?
Let's get out of here.

339
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:20,324
- Mm.
- Finish that.

340
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,360
- Come on.
- Okay.

341
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:24,162
- Yes!

342
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,670
- Take a break.

343
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:36,374
No trick, no test.
I promise.

344
00:19:44,018 --> 00:19:44,917
That's it?

345
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:49,687
Take your balls out
of your purse and drink.

346
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:54,292
- No, if we're gonna talk
about what we did,

347
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:55,760
then we have to call it
what it is.

348
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:57,528
It's stupid.
It's so fucking stupid.

349
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,931
It's the stupidest
I've ever fucking been.

350
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:01,933
- Reynard set us up.

351
00:20:01,935 --> 00:20:03,935
- Yeah, but I should have
known better.

352
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:07,872
You know, I knew the difference
between magic and miracles.

353
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:11,809
One is real and one is
a lie with sparkles.

354
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:16,347
Like a nice female god was
gonna glide in and save...

355
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:19,483
It sounds so naive
to ever believe in that.

356
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:21,953
- Look, there is
one way through this,

357
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:25,389
and that is to find out
what happened 40 years ago.

358
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,291
- Yeah, and banish the fuck
out of Reynard.

359
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:30,828
- Yeah, so let's just get this
pesky abortion out of the way,

360
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,231
and that's next on the list.

361
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,700
- I know this is
a straightforward procedure.

362
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:38,703
It's probably, you know,
the simplest thing

363
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:41,839
I've had to deal with in months.

364
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:44,242
But I am nervous.

365
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,349
- I had one.

366
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,854
He was a drummer.

367
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:01,692
And he said he couldn't
get it up with a condom.

368
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:05,463
But...

369
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:10,001
I... I remember the night before.

370
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:13,004
It... I felt...

371
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,941
I felt lonely.

372
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:21,545
- Yeah.

373
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:24,282
- But you're not alone.

374
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:26,450
I'm your best bitch, remember?

375
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,721
- Yeah.

376
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:34,358
- Okay, your turn.
- Truth or dare.

377
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,861
- Truth.

378
00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:38,996
- Do you still blame yourself?

379
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:41,632
- Shit. Okay.

380
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:42,933
- Sorry, no.

381
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:46,070
I think I'm drunker
than I think I am.

382
00:21:46,072 --> 00:21:47,772
Was that a sentence?

383
00:21:47,774 --> 00:21:50,841
- No, I said truth.

384
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:55,046
So do you know what happened?

385
00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:56,714
- I mean, just what
Alice told me.

386
00:21:56,716 --> 00:22:00,418
That you changed your face
for a professor

387
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,921
and it got screwed up
and Charlie tried to save you.

388
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:06,357
- Yeah, that's the gist.

389
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:09,794
How is Alice?

390
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:12,063
- Uh, Alice is dead.

391
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:25,710
- I don't blame myself.

392
00:22:25,712 --> 00:22:29,513
Except for when
I first wake up...

393
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,015
And when I go to bed

394
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:36,053
and all the time in between.

395
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,493
Your turn.

396
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,597
- Dare.

397
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,499
- Dare.

398
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:53,637
My dare is to smoke weed?

399
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:56,073
It's very middle school.

400
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,512
- Oh, oh.

401
00:23:01,514 --> 00:23:03,681
Do you know...

402
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:05,116
Do you know Weizenheim's third?

403
00:23:05,118 --> 00:23:07,818
It's a tiny, little
weather suspension spell.

404
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,920
- I thought you didn't...
- I don't.

405
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:11,689
This doesn't count.

406
00:23:11,691 --> 00:23:13,057
Today's a cheat day.

407
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,593
- Right.

408
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:19,463
- Oh, the trick to this one
is that you enchant your lips.

409
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:34,478
- And you're a smoke artiste.
- Mm. Okay.

410
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,646
- Your turn.

411
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:37,014
Don't, like, burn yourself.

412
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:39,417
- Okay, how do you do it?
- Oh, um...

413
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:40,584
Okay, let me.

414
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,040
You're a fucking dork.

415
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:05,509
You're just jealous that
I'm such a quick study.

416
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:08,512
Yeah.

417
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:10,514
Okay.

418
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:20,791
- What is that?

419
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,860
- This one's my favorite.

420
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,871
- That's my favorite, too.

421
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:39,710
- Ooh!
- Come on in.

422
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:42,046
- Okay.

423
00:24:42,048 --> 00:24:44,682
Emily Greenstreet,

424
00:24:44,684 --> 00:24:47,084
living the loft life, huh?

425
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:49,487
Yeah.

426
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:50,554
Wine opener?

427
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:52,823
- One of those drawers.
- One of the...

428
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,092
- wine opener.

429
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:58,229
Ahh, wine opener, wine opener.

430
00:24:58,231 --> 00:25:00,931
- Hey.

431
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:05,102
I wanna do a spell.

432
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:06,937
- Why don't we keep drinking

433
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:11,041
and make some really,
really bad decisions?

434
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:13,844
That sounds, I don't know,
kind of fun.

435
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:17,681
- Yeah. You'll like it.

436
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:20,851
- Mm.
- Come on.

437
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,920
Cheat day.

438
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:26,690
- The defenestration
. Of Prague.

439
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:27,791
- No, you already said that.

440
00:25:27,793 --> 00:25:29,226
- There were two.
- Mm.

441
00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:31,595
- Look, any hope you had
of saving this guy

442
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:32,930
is out the window.

443
00:25:32,932 --> 00:25:37,601
Like the guys in Prague.

444
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:39,003
- Shit.

445
00:25:39,005 --> 00:25:44,775
- Eliot, we said we'd do
whatever actually works.

446
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:47,912
- Fine. We'll tell the council
in the morning.

447
00:25:47,914 --> 00:25:49,079
But I'll do it.

448
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:51,815
The man's life
is my burden to bear.

449
00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:57,688
- Get over yourself, Ned stark.

450
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,323
Ned stark.

451
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:13,237
- Do you even like magic?

452
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:15,339
- Yeah, like...

453
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:19,977
Like I like money or food
or any other useful shit.

454
00:26:19,979 --> 00:26:22,580
- Money and food
don't explode in your face.

455
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:26,216
You came to Brakebills
only to ease your suffering.

456
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:29,920
The voices.
It was all chore and burden.

457
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,990
But you saved yourself,
traveler.

458
00:26:32,992 --> 00:26:35,659
Good.

459
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:38,062
Maybe you're simply done.

460
00:26:38,064 --> 00:26:42,232
Now's your chance.
Walk away.

461
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:45,903
- Why? Chance at what?

462
00:26:45,905 --> 00:26:49,607
- Few years of happy life.

463
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:56,880
- There is bad surprise
in store for everyone.

464
00:26:56,882 --> 00:27:00,284
- What surprise?

465
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:05,222
- Energy current
should be constant.

466
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:11,762
- But it's not.
- Why?

467
00:27:11,764 --> 00:27:13,964
- There is something
happening to magic.

468
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,266
- The wellspring in Fillory.

469
00:27:16,268 --> 00:27:19,737
- The current is sputtering.
- And they're trying to fix it.

470
00:27:19,739 --> 00:27:21,972
- Maybe it's going to disappear.

471
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:24,341
- If that's the case...
- Shit could get real.

472
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:28,812
- If magic goes, it will be
very bad time to be magician,

473
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:32,416
so consider the advantage
of getting out now.

474
00:27:32,418 --> 00:27:34,351
- All right.
- Okay, thank you.

475
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:37,421
I'll meditate on it.
I...

476
00:27:37,423 --> 00:27:40,324
Right now, I'm staying.

477
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:44,828
- Then you're just fancy scarf
wrapped around an idiot.

478
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,364
- You know what?
- If it's so bad, you get out!

479
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:50,067
You leave, I'll leave.

480
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:53,203
- I cannot leave.
- Thanks for reminder.

481
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:56,407
- What... what,
you're trapped here?

482
00:27:56,409 --> 00:27:58,909
- Remarkably like that.

483
00:27:58,911 --> 00:28:01,045
Incorporate bond.

484
00:28:01,047 --> 00:28:03,247
Even I cannot break.

485
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:05,182
- Why?

486
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:09,153
What did you do?

487
00:28:09,155 --> 00:28:12,156
- I'm not drunk enough
to talk about it.

488
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:21,832
Okay!

489
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:23,901
I make love to many students.

490
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:28,405
And then I fucked the wrong one.

491
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:30,808
Oops.

492
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:33,811
- They sent you here?
- God.

493
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:35,379
- It was that...

494
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:42,219
Or give up magic.

495
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:45,389
- Like you're telling me to.
- Yes.

496
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,991
<i>I made my choice.</i>

497
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:05,876
Wakey, wakey.

498
00:29:05,878 --> 00:29:09,012
You have 15 minutes
to save your life.

499
00:29:09,014 --> 00:29:12,182
Tell me, if you were in charge,

500
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:15,452
how would the FU fighters
fix Fillory?

501
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:19,423
- It's an illusion spell.

502
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:21,158
Party trick, really.
It'll only last

503
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,294
as long as your skin's wet.

504
00:29:24,296 --> 00:58:48,590
You first.

505
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:28,932
- Yeah. You know, this is
the weirdest foreplay.

506
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:31,235
- Oh, my god. Stop.

507
00:29:31,237 --> 00:29:33,504
Robe off!

508
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:39,777
Whoa, what is that?

509
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:41,178
- Oh, right, uh...

510
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,813
- You joined some kinda gang?

511
00:29:42,815 --> 00:29:44,782
- Yes.

512
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:46,216
- Okay.

513
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:48,852
Hop in.

514
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:16,146
Did it work?

515
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,921
Oh, shit.

516
00:30:23,923 --> 00:30:25,355
- Don't judge me, please.

517
00:30:25,357 --> 00:30:29,393
- I'm not. I'm just
putting it all together.

518
00:30:29,395 --> 00:30:32,162
You, Charlie.

519
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:34,965
That's why he's
at Brakebills south.

520
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:36,400
I mean, I had a lot of theories.

521
00:30:36,402 --> 00:30:38,468
- Shh.

522
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,604
You're ruining it.

523
00:30:40,606 --> 00:30:45,375
Just tell me what you think
when you look at me.

524
00:30:45,377 --> 00:30:49,146
And can you maybe try
a Russian accent?

525
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:03,260
- You didn't wanna...

526
00:31:03,262 --> 00:31:05,596
- This is what I miss the most.

527
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:14,004
So...

528
00:31:14,006 --> 00:31:15,639
Your turn.

529
00:31:40,164 --> 00:31:43,300
- It's her.

530
00:31:43,302 --> 00:31:45,235
It's your memories.

531
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:52,409
Well?
Anything you wanna say?

532
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:57,514
- I just really
fucking miss you.

533
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:51,501
What...

534
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:55,405
- Is that?
- Yeah.

535
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:58,342
Um, hey, I...
I've gotta get home.

536
00:32:58,344 --> 00:33:00,978
Um...

537
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,579
I had a good time.

538
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:05,349
- You don't have to go.
- We can do it again.

539
00:33:05,351 --> 00:33:07,017
- You said yesterday
was cheat day.

540
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:08,719
You can't...

541
00:33:08,721 --> 00:33:11,488
You can't cheat every day.

542
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,091
- I won't tell.

543
00:33:14,093 --> 00:33:17,494
No, I don't want to.

544
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:20,063
- So, what, you're...
- Done with me?

545
00:33:20,065 --> 00:33:22,632
I... I was helping you.

546
00:33:22,634 --> 00:33:24,401
- That's not what I said.

547
00:33:24,403 --> 00:33:27,537
- Tell me, then.
- What are you saying?

548
00:33:30,241 --> 00:33:33,043
- Last night was...

549
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:38,515
It felt really good,
and it was...

550
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:44,321
Probably exactly what I needed,
but I...

551
00:33:44,323 --> 00:33:49,192
It was also really weird and sad
and I feel awful.

552
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:53,063
I feel worse than before.

553
00:33:53,065 --> 00:33:55,232
- Apologies
for my terrible life.

554
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:01,338
- I just don't wanna
use magic like that.

555
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,612
I'm sorry for
everything you lost.

556
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:15,552
I'll see you at work.

557
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:28,265
- It is after much deliberation
that I have decided...

558
00:34:28,267 --> 00:34:30,367
We will not
execute the prisoner.

559
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:31,735
- What?

560
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:34,504
Your majesty, I'm...

561
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:36,339
- It is in Fillory's
best interest.

562
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:39,543
- We agreed to have the prisoner
executed today.

563
00:34:39,545 --> 00:34:42,612
- We did.
- But I changed my mind.

564
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:47,117
- Well, I didn't.

565
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,351
And I'm high queen.

566
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:50,320
- The queen may
voice her opinion,

567
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:54,124
but ultimate judgment
belongs to the king.

568
00:34:54,126 --> 00:34:58,728
- So this is what
the patriarchy smells like?

569
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:01,164
It's not the freshest.

570
00:35:03,201 --> 00:35:05,602
You are a king.
Act like it.

571
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:08,605
- I'm not just a king.

572
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:10,273
Fen's pregnant.

573
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:13,410
I'm gonna be a father.

574
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:17,781
Mm.

575
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:19,749
And I would like
to raise my child

576
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:25,222
in a world that does not just
kill its problems away.

577
00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:29,726
We hear them and we
address them accordingly.

578
00:35:29,728 --> 00:35:31,895
- That is fucking stupid.

579
00:35:31,897 --> 00:35:34,364
You wanna rule a kingdom?
Guess what.

580
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:38,235
People are gonna die
no matter what.

581
00:35:38,237 --> 00:35:41,171
Just trying to make sure
that it isn't you, okay?

582
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:51,314
<i>- Julia, I'll check you in.</i>

583
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:53,283
<i>Dr. Higgins will be
ready shortly.</i>

584
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,586
Okay.

585
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:12,435
I'm sorry, you're not in here.

586
00:36:12,437 --> 01:12:24,872
- Excuse me?

587
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:15,505
- You don't have an appointment.

588
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,807
- The doctor gave me one.
- I mean, there must be a mistake.

589
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:20,443
- I'm sorry, but without an
appointment, I can't let you in.

590
00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:22,913
- Look, it's wicker.
- Julia wicker.

591
00:36:22,915 --> 00:36:24,548
You just said my name
two seconds ago.

592
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:26,583
Can you just pick up the phone
and ask her?

593
00:36:30,788 --> 00:36:33,890
- Doctor, there's a woman
claiming she's a patient.

594
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:35,325
No, she doesn't.

595
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:38,595
Uh, Julia wicker.

596
00:36:38,597 --> 00:36:40,597
But, doctor...

597
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:43,400
Okay.

598
00:36:43,402 --> 00:36:46,403
- You can go ahead.
- Yeah, thanks.

599
00:36:46,405 --> 00:36:49,439
- I'll be right here.

600
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:03,853
. - No geese!

601
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:05,855
Oh.

602
00:37:05,857 --> 00:37:08,391
Phew.

603
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:10,894
You finish table.
Good work.

604
00:37:10,896 --> 00:37:13,630
- Yeah, so can we get to this?

605
00:37:13,632 --> 00:37:16,366
Enough "karate kid" bullshit.

606
00:37:16,368 --> 00:37:18,668
- Not bullshit.

607
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:23,006
Ask yourself a question:

608
00:37:23,008 --> 00:37:26,977
What will a magician need
if dark days come?

609
00:37:26,979 --> 00:37:29,346
Magic.

610
00:37:29,348 --> 00:37:30,714
But if it is gone,
it is gone, you say.

611
00:37:30,716 --> 00:37:34,517
Not so, if you store it
like a battery.

612
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:36,820
That's what I am building.

613
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:46,396
Those knots?

614
00:37:46,398 --> 00:37:48,798
Old class project,
tied with magic.

615
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,802
That table, stained
through with magic.

616
00:37:52,804 --> 00:37:57,807
You release the energy,
I store it for rainy day.

617
00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:02,045
- So my hands, are you
gonna teach me or what?

618
00:38:02,047 --> 00:38:05,582
- You can travel to Fillory.

619
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,786
- It's the worst place
in the universe, yeah.

620
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:13,423
- You go there.
- Get this.

621
00:38:13,425 --> 00:38:15,659
- Moss. You need moss.

622
00:38:15,661 --> 00:38:18,428
- It's amazing.
- Can carry current.

623
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:22,632
- Do not care.

624
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:27,804
I'll get it.

625
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:37,314
- Gods, it's good to see you.

626
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:38,581
- You asshole!

627
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:40,450
You come here with no warning

628
00:38:40,452 --> 00:38:41,985
and try to kill my husband.

629
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:44,354
- Of course I did.

630
00:38:44,356 --> 00:38:45,955
I thought you were waiting.

631
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:47,957
- I'm not a FU fighter anymore.

632
00:38:47,959 --> 00:38:49,926
You always knew
that one day I'd have to...

633
00:38:49,928 --> 00:38:53,563
- marry him, yes, and then
you'd be here, on the inside.

634
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:58,335
You can't tell me that you don't
care about Fillory anymore.

635
00:38:58,337 --> 00:39:00,070
- I'm pregnant.

636
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:05,875
- Then for the child.
- What?

637
00:39:05,877 --> 00:39:08,011
- All I ask is you get us
information we need to...

638
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:10,480
- Bayler!

639
00:39:10,482 --> 00:39:12,949
- Did I say "ask"?

640
00:39:12,951 --> 00:39:15,018
I meant help us.

641
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:18,355
Or I go to your king
and tell him exactly how well

642
00:39:18,357 --> 00:39:20,390
I know his wife.

643
00:39:20,392 --> 00:39:22,525
- Then I'll tell him myself.

644
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:26,062
- Word travels fast
about the high king.

645
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:28,031
Emotional.

646
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:30,133
Easily wounded.

647
00:39:30,135 --> 00:39:32,902
Try it and see.

648
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:35,705
Or help the cause.

649
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:43,079
- If the FU fighters
make another move,

650
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:45,115
I'll kill you myself.

651
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:55,425
- That should do it.

652
00:39:55,427 --> 00:39:57,026
How are you feeling?

653
00:39:57,028 --> 00:40:02,932
- Like I finally understand why
people take these kind of drugs.

654
00:40:02,934 --> 00:40:04,567
- Okay, we'll start
the procedure.

655
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:05,668
You may feel some cramping,

656
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,904
and that's perfectly normal.

657
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:23,086
- What... what's wrong?

658
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:26,589
- Morning cobwebs.
- Excuse me.

659
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:30,026
- Just relax.
- Okay.

660
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:56,719
What are you doing?

661
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:03,226
Wait.

662
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,596
Stop.

663
00:41:09,868 --> 00:41:11,601
- Stop it! Wait!
- I can't.

664
00:41:11,603 --> 00:41:13,470
- Stop!
- What are you doing? No!

665
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,471
Kady!

666
00:41:14,473 --> 00:41:15,805
Kady!

667
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:17,507
Kady!

668
00:41:17,509 --> 00:41:20,710
- I can't...
- Stop!

669
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:32,121
- Oh, my god.

670
00:41:32,123 --> 00:41:35,492
Holy fuck.

671
00:41:35,494 --> 00:41:39,596
Oh, my...

672
00:41:39,598 --> 00:41:40,897
- Do it.
- What?

673
00:41:40,899 --> 00:41:42,499
- Do it. You have wards.

674
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:44,767
The thing, it got to her.
Just get it out of me, Kady.

675
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:46,035
- Julia, that is a dead body.

676
00:41:46,037 --> 00:41:49,038
We need to get rid of it
right now.

677
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,773
Fuck, Jules.

678
00:41:50,775 --> 00:41:52,876
We will find another way.
