1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,368
<i>- Previously on
"the magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:02,469 --> 00:00:04,035
- You may address me
as Reynard the fox,

3
00:00:05,104 --> 00:00:07,171
trickster of the faithful,
the very stupid.

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,543
- You must be Marina.

5
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:16,715
- I need you to tell me
about the thing that killed you.

6
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:19,651
- There was a girl.

7
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:23,154
40 years ago, she vanished
Reynard from earth.

8
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:25,257
<i>- Charlie, my brother,
he was really, really good.</i>

9
00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:27,092
<i>You know that spell I did
on the first day of class</i>

10
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:28,860
<i>with the glass horse?
He taught me that.</i>

11
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,997
- I fell for this professor.
- He was married.

12
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:35,634
I thought I could
make him love me again

13
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:37,903
if I could make myself prettier.

14
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:40,605
<i>I really believed he might
actually be able</i>

15
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:41,940
<i>to undo what I did.</i>

16
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:45,010
It burned until he wasn't
there anymore.

17
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:47,879
I gave up magic
and never looked back.

18
00:00:51,018 --> 00:00:53,018
- No!

19
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,319
<i>Alice is gone.</i>

20
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:55,820
<i>There's a creature,</i>

21
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,155
<i>she's called the white lady.</i>

22
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:58,757
- I want my hands back.

23
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,759
No!

24
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:03,228
- Alice Quinn.
- Bring her back to life.

25
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,629
- I can't.

26
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:06,031
Is there nothing else
you desire?

27
00:01:06,033 --> 00:01:07,065
- Send me home.

28
00:01:13,839 --> 00:01:15,774
- I spoke with professor Lipson

29
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,609
about the tests she ran.

30
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:19,844
But I'm sorry to say that

31
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:21,346
we don't even know
where to start.

32
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:23,648
- Okay, is this a normal candle
or what...

33
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:29,788
Of course.

34
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,122
You cure your own hands
just fine, but mine,

35
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:32,791
you can't do
a fucking thing about, huh?

36
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:37,696
- Broken or not,
my hands are my hands.

37
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:39,698
Yours are something else.

38
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,333
There's nothing we can do.

39
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:43,168
- And Brakebills
continues its tradition

40
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,603
of fucking my shit.

41
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:46,671
- There's nothing
we can do here.

42
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:49,641
There are other options.

43
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:53,278
One, I send you to someone
who may know more.

44
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,613
- Yes. Who is it?

45
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:55,847
- Professor Mayakovsky.

46
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:57,816
- The drunk perv in the igloo?

47
00:01:57,818 --> 00:01:59,084
Pass.

48
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:00,352
What's option two?

49
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:03,221
- Hmm, well,
you won't have to worry

50
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,123
about your hands
or magic at all.

51
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,225
It's actually where
I sent Quentin.

52
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,194
- Where's Quentin?

53
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,141
- So we finally get
to the cashier and guess what.

54
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:27,045
- Hmm?
- I left my wallet in the car.

55
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:30,081
- Oh, man.
- Talk about bad timing.

56
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,017
- Yeah.

57
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:34,419
Hey, does donut house,
does that taste like donuts?

58
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:36,688
- I just use that thing
for soup.

59
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,157
- Soup?

60
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,192
What the fuck?

61
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:42,420
- Hello?

62
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:45,890
Professor Mayakovsky?

63
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:54,466
Shh...

64
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:57,202
Hey! Hey, let me down!

65
00:03:57,204 --> 00:03:59,437
I'm a student!

66
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,342
Dick.

67
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,148
- "Chicago register."
July '76.

68
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,416
- You know, dead or not,
Marina could have been

69
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:12,984
a little more specific.

70
00:04:12,986 --> 00:04:15,487
I still don't know
what I'm looking for.

71
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:18,389
- Look, banishing Reynard had to
take an insane amount of energy.

72
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:22,327
So any sort of strange event
or operation.

73
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:25,497
- Yeah, that's literally
the definition of "news."

74
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:27,365
- We'll know it when we see it.

75
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:46,017
I need some fuel.

76
00:04:55,194 --> 00:04:57,328
Okay.

77
00:05:01,867 --> 00:05:03,334
You okay?

78
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:12,177
- Is that the second time today?

79
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:14,145
- Third.

80
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:24,522
- Here.

81
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:27,559
Oh, god, Jules, I...

82
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:29,060
- Fuck!
- Hey.

83
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:30,895
- Fuck.
- Hey, come on, come on.

84
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:32,997
- Hey, sit.
- Why?

85
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,099
Why won't it just end?

86
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:38,303
Why does it just keep getting
worse and worse?

87
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:39,938
- I'm so sorry.

88
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,006
- Whatever's...
- What's the spell

89
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,575
to terminate it or whatever?

90
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:45,510
- I mean, there's stuff out
there, but it's all shady,

91
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:48,880
dark ages shit from before
modern medicine.

92
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:51,015
You don't cauterize a paper cut

93
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,151
with a crazy,
medieval blowtorch.

94
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:55,954
- Sounds like exactly
what I wanna do.

95
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:58,189
- Not if it erases
your uterus and kidneys

96
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,158
along with the fetus.

97
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,559
- Jesus.

98
00:06:01,561 --> 00:06:05,029
- Hey, it's... it's okay.

99
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:08,933
Jules, this is a simple,
totally mundane procedure.

100
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,202
- Is it? 'Cause it might not
be a simple,

101
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,204
totally mundane human embryo.

102
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,206
I mean...

103
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:19,043
I don't even know if it's
Reynard's or Richard's.

104
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:23,948
- Right now, it is just
a clump of cells.

105
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:27,485
Okay, so, let's just
put a pin in all this, okay?

106
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,487
We'll make an appointment.

107
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:40,398
- Your majesty.
- It's ready.

108
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:44,068
- At the very least, I hope you
solved the carbonation issue.

109
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:48,439
We had to dump that last glass
in another world, you know.

110
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,408
Still bubbling.

111
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:58,249
Oh, the miles we must walk.

112
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:01,252
- My king.
- I have the best news.

113
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,055
- If that rabbit
was a prosecco, I'd agree.

114
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:06,391
- This isn't just a rabbit.

115
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:09,027
- Pregnant.
- Jesus.

116
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,695
- We're going to be parents.

117
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:13,164
- That rabbit knows if you're...

118
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,500
- Pregnant.
- Okay, okay.

119
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:20,305
- You're not smiling.
- I'm sorry.

120
00:07:20,307 --> 00:07:22,106
- It's just... you see...
- pregnant.

121
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:25,076
- Okay, rabbit! Chill.

122
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:29,280
Ah, ah! Where do you think
you're going?

123
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,382
It may suck all the moisture
from my tongue,

124
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:35,153
but damned if I'm not going
to toast to this shit.

125
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:39,223
To our violently attractive
progeny.

126
00:07:49,201 --> 00:07:51,269
- Hey, yo!
- Yo, let me down, okay?

127
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:54,973
What the fuck is this shit?

128
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,441
- What do you want?

129
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:59,177
- My hands can't
cast spells anymore.

130
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:03,681
- This is not Mayakovsy's home
for magically inert.

131
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:08,086
But maybe an exchange.

132
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,620
- What do you got in mind?

133
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:11,723
- I'm in the middle of project.

134
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:15,259
Help me, I do what I can.

135
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,198
- I'm in.
- Okay.

136
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:29,774
- Is everybody out here
really so lifeless?

137
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:33,478
- Yes. We are, we are.
- That's why we drink.

138
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,246
- Well, I drink just fine
as a magician.

139
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:37,382
- Yeah, because your world
was so overwhelming and scary

140
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:39,017
and you needed a break
from it all.

141
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,184
Now you're gonna drink

142
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,586
because each day
is so goddamn dull

143
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:44,789
and that takes a lot more booze.

144
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,391
- You ever cast anymore?

145
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:47,558
- God, no.

146
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,793
- Sorry, that was stupid.

147
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:51,062
- No, it's okay.

148
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:52,296
I mean, nobody ever
gives up magic

149
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:55,633
because everything's peachy.

150
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:57,568
You wanna tell me?

151
00:09:03,742 --> 00:09:05,276
- Uh...
- I'm sorry.

152
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:07,712
No. I shouldn't have asked.

153
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:10,681
I can see that it's recent.

154
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:13,751
It's fucking madness.

155
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:16,487
Teaching that stuff to kids.
I mean... Kids.

156
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,356
- It's like, what's the point?
- You know?

157
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,258
'Cause it feels like for every
one thing that we fix,

158
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:23,094
five shitty things
spring up in its place.

159
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:25,329
- Because each spell
is just another complication.

160
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:27,198
- That we cast
another spell to fix.

161
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,267
- Repeat, repeat, repeat.

162
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:33,171
- Until there's no spell left
and you're just...

163
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:37,675
- You're left with...
- a big fucking problem.

164
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:44,415
Oh, shit.
I have a meeting in 15.

165
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,117
- Ooh.

166
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,521
I'm sorry.
That was just reflex.

167
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:53,591
Uh, that... I... um...

168
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:58,162
- Just... just put this
on the company card.

169
00:09:58,164 --> 00:09:59,697
They won't notice.

170
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:03,768
<i>- I am happy.</i>

171
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,736
Yay, a baby.

172
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:08,639
- Eliot, what is this about?

173
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,444
I really wanna know.

174
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:17,782
My father was not the best...

175
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,484
- Wine, your majesty.

176
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:20,751
- Bad dad.

177
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:25,723
So I suppose I don't
exactly have the proper,

178
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:27,725
uh, uh...

179
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,360
Template to...

180
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,462
Ahh!

181
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,464
- Quiet!

182
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,400
You are not welcome here,
child of earth.

183
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:39,637
- Eliot!

184
00:10:48,747 --> 00:10:51,349
- Wait.

185
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:53,484
- This is not over,
child of earth.

186
00:10:57,789 --> 00:10:59,724
- Dungeon.

187
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,228
- What the hell was that about?

188
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,498
- I tried expressing
my emotions.

189
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,667
Lesson learned.

190
00:11:14,772 --> 00:11:19,275
- Shittiest security ever.

191
00:11:19,277 --> 00:11:21,244
- So what are we supposed to do?

192
00:11:21,246 --> 00:11:23,947
- Ship 'em back to Loria?
- Actually, your highness,

193
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:25,782
he's not from Loria.

194
00:11:25,784 --> 00:11:27,317
- He's a native Fillorian.

195
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:30,019
- My own people
are trying to kill me?

196
00:11:30,021 --> 00:11:32,155
Hmm.
So French.

197
00:11:32,157 --> 00:11:34,924
- They're commoners.
- Not to worry.

198
00:11:34,926 --> 00:11:37,327
- Oh, whoa, whoa.
- I'm worried.

199
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:40,597
- I urge
a public execution, today.

200
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:43,199
- Might I suggest strangulation?

201
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:44,667
For the symbolism.

202
00:11:44,669 --> 00:11:46,135
- We don't wish
to fall to his level.

203
00:11:46,137 --> 00:11:48,705
The bed of a thousand spikes
should do just fine.

204
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:57,847
- Her slowness suggests tying
each of his limbs to a centaur,

205
00:11:57,849 --> 00:12:00,650
and as they stretch him,
inch by inch,

206
00:12:00,652 --> 00:12:05,688
a fifth centaur sets the spike,
if you will.

207
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:06,688
- Jesus, no.

208
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:10,359
Everyone out. This is a matter
for the queen and me.

209
00:12:11,295 --> 00:12:14,364
- That sloth is psychotic.

210
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,966
- It's all psychotic.

211
00:12:16,968 --> 00:12:19,335
Did you hear how tick
said "commoners"?

212
00:12:19,337 --> 00:12:21,638
- When we're the least snobby
people in a room,

213
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,107
there's something wrong
with the room.

214
00:12:31,382 --> 00:12:32,882
- Yes?

215
00:12:32,884 --> 00:12:35,685
- I wanted to apologize.

216
00:12:35,687 --> 00:12:38,888
I'm sorry, um...

217
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,757
- Okay.

218
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,261
What?

219
00:12:45,263 --> 00:12:51,100
- I just... I don't know
if you accepted my apology.

220
00:12:51,102 --> 00:12:54,270
- Yes.

221
00:12:54,272 --> 00:12:57,040
- Okay.
- Actually, no.

222
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:59,409
No, I don't.

223
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:02,278
We had just talked about
how terrible magic is,

224
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,881
and then you went and did it.

225
00:13:04,883 --> 00:13:07,116
- It was just a tiny spell.

226
00:13:07,118 --> 00:13:08,785
- There are a lot
of companies like this.

227
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:11,320
I'm sure Fogg can find
another one for you.

228
00:13:14,993 --> 00:13:16,693
- Okay.

229
00:13:33,977 --> 00:13:35,311
<i>- They're useless, right?</i>

230
00:13:35,313 --> 00:13:39,415
- Well, maybe not useless.

231
00:13:41,885 --> 00:13:44,921
You can still grab hold
of things, wave hello,

232
00:13:44,923 --> 00:13:46,856
rub away a lonely night.

233
00:13:46,858 --> 00:13:47,990
- Okay, but for magic?

234
00:13:47,992 --> 00:13:49,892
- For magic? Useless.

235
00:13:52,196 --> 00:13:54,363
How was your travel?

236
00:13:54,365 --> 00:13:56,365
- Fine.

237
00:13:56,367 --> 00:13:59,469
Aim's good. I just can't
take people with me.

238
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:01,471
- Some might call that blessing.

239
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:03,973
- Yeah, well the option
would be nice, so...

240
00:14:03,975 --> 00:14:06,075
I mean, can you help me?
What are we doing here?

241
00:14:06,077 --> 00:14:07,910
- I can help you.

242
00:14:07,912 --> 00:14:11,180
But first, your end of deal.

243
00:14:21,024 --> 00:14:23,292
Take out all the knots.

244
00:14:25,496 --> 00:14:28,364
- What the hell?

245
00:14:28,366 --> 00:14:32,902
- Ms. wicker.
- Uh, Julia.

246
00:14:32,904 --> 00:14:35,938
- The test was positive.

247
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,508
If you'd like, we can
discuss your options.

248
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,977
- I want an abortion.
- Okay.

249
00:14:40,979 --> 00:14:43,279
That's something that we can
perform here in office.

250
00:14:43,281 --> 00:14:46,382
- Great. Uh, today?

251
00:14:46,384 --> 00:14:48,184
- Unfortunately, we do have
a waiting list,

252
00:14:48,186 --> 00:14:49,986
but it should just be
a couple of days.

253
00:14:49,988 --> 00:14:52,889
- Days?

254
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:55,892
Doctor, I can't wait
a couple of days.

255
00:14:55,894 --> 00:14:58,327
Please, I...

256
00:14:59,897 --> 00:15:05,168
- if I suspect abuse,
I'm obligated to report it.

257
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,069
Julia, you're safe here.

258
00:15:07,071 --> 00:15:09,405
You can talk about
what happened.

259
00:15:09,407 --> 00:15:14,076
No one is above the law.

260
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:16,279
Ah, sorry.

261
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:20,116
I wish that were true.

262
00:15:20,118 --> 00:15:22,852
Look, I just want this
to be over,

263
00:15:22,854 --> 00:15:26,122
and you can help me.

264
00:15:26,124 --> 00:15:29,025
Please.

265
00:15:29,027 --> 00:15:30,893
- Okay.

266
00:15:30,895 --> 00:15:33,329
We'll set you up
for an ultrasound today.

267
00:15:33,331 --> 00:15:36,599
Tomorrow, you can perform
the procedure.

268
00:15:36,601 --> 00:15:39,035
We open at 8:00.

269
00:15:39,037 --> 00:15:42,271
- Thank you.
- See you then.

270
00:15:55,252 --> 00:15:56,118
. - Hi.

271
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,453
- Leave.

272
00:15:57,455 --> 00:16:00,156
- You don't get to say that.
- And why not?

273
00:16:00,158 --> 00:16:02,425
- Uh, because
you're in our castle.

274
00:16:02,427 --> 00:16:04,560
- Which is on my land.

275
00:16:04,562 --> 00:16:07,363
- Uh, excuse me, my manners.

276
00:16:07,365 --> 00:16:09,165
I'm Eliot, high king of Fillory.

277
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:14,237
- And I'm Bayler, a proud
soldier of fillorians united.

278
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:16,472
A FU fighter.

279
00:16:16,474 --> 00:16:19,208
- Did you say, "foo fighter"?
- Margo, behave.

280
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:22,979
- We will not rest until a
Fillorian sits upon the throne.

281
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:25,381
- Okay, tell Ember.

282
00:16:25,383 --> 00:16:26,616
He issued the decree.

283
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:29,552
- We will execute
every child of earth

284
00:16:29,554 --> 00:16:33,222
that crosses into our land until
there are none left to kill.

285
00:16:33,224 --> 00:16:36,292
And yet, you laugh.

286
00:16:38,262 --> 00:16:40,563
- I mean, a foo fighter?
- Margo.

287
00:16:40,565 --> 00:16:44,634
If we execute him,
then he's a martyr.

288
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:46,502
- Shit.

289
00:16:46,504 --> 00:16:48,471
When was the last time
either of us dealt with

290
00:16:48,473 --> 00:16:50,606
a political insurgency?

291
00:16:50,608 --> 00:16:53,576
- Unless getting kicked out
of a fivesome counts.

292
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:55,144
- First for me.
- Same.

293
00:16:55,146 --> 00:16:57,914
I'm thinking we should
probably bone up.

294
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,114
- Like, study?

295
00:16:59,216 --> 00:17:02,350
- I'll grab what I can from
the Brakebills library.

296
00:17:02,352 --> 00:17:03,652
- Fine.

297
00:17:03,654 --> 00:17:05,655
And grab some Adderall
while you're there.

298
00:17:14,097 --> 00:17:17,633
- Okay, I'm done.

299
00:17:17,635 --> 00:17:20,336
Oh, shit! What?
Do not... don't... please...

300
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:22,138
Don't sneak up on me like that.

301
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,539
- This is my house.

302
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,441
- Look, I finished untying
your bondage kit.

303
00:17:25,443 --> 00:17:26,976
You gonna teach me now?

304
00:17:26,978 --> 00:17:29,312
- You finish first step.

305
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:32,682
Next... The table.

306
00:17:35,285 --> 00:17:37,086
- What about it?

307
00:17:37,088 --> 00:17:39,221
- You make it sawdust.

308
00:17:39,223 --> 00:17:43,693
Do not worry.
I give you tool.

309
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:45,728
Enjoy.

310
00:17:58,709 --> 00:18:02,111
- What are you still doing here?

311
00:18:02,113 --> 00:18:04,113
- I'm just finishing up.

312
00:18:04,115 --> 00:18:05,448
- Gonna jerk it?

313
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,316
- Break in the office?
- No.

314
00:18:07,318 --> 00:18:08,451
What? No, I'm...

315
00:18:08,453 --> 00:18:09,585
- it's the only place I can.

316
00:18:09,587 --> 00:18:13,322
Wife and two kids?
No privacy at home.

317
00:18:13,324 --> 00:18:16,359
- I'm not doing that...

318
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:17,460
Here.

319
00:18:17,462 --> 00:18:19,695
- Just saying.
- It's no judgment.

320
00:18:19,697 --> 00:18:22,264
Adios.

321
00:18:26,069 --> 00:18:29,638
- I owe you an apology
for being a bitch.

322
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,608
- Could you knock, please?

323
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:36,112
- What? Were you masturbating
in your office?

324
00:18:36,114 --> 00:18:37,446
- No!

325
00:18:37,448 --> 00:18:39,482
- Whatever. I do.

326
00:18:39,484 --> 00:18:41,417
- What is this place?

327
00:18:45,655 --> 00:18:47,623
- I'm sorry, again,
about the spell, I...

328
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:51,360
- I'm sorry
for making you feel sorry.

329
00:18:51,362 --> 00:18:56,198
It was just a stupid spell.

330
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,767
- Thank you.

331
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,301
- Want some?

332
00:18:59,303 --> 00:19:01,470
Vodka. Bit of lime.

333
00:19:06,376 --> 00:19:08,277
You should stay.

334
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:09,445
Forget what I said earlier.

335
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:14,116
I think we'd be good friends.

336
00:19:14,118 --> 00:19:16,252
- I would like that.

337
00:19:16,254 --> 00:19:18,421
- What the hell are we
still doing in the office?

338
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:20,756
Right?
Let's get out of here.

339
00:19:20,758 --> 00:19:22,224
- Mm.
- Finish that.

340
00:19:22,226 --> 00:19:24,260
- Come on.
- Okay.

341
00:19:24,262 --> 00:19:26,062
- Yes!

342
00:19:32,569 --> 00:19:34,570
- Take a break.

343
00:19:35,772 --> 00:19:38,274
No trick, no test.
I promise.

344
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:46,817
That's it?

345
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:51,587
Take your balls out
of your purse and drink.

346
00:19:54,157 --> 00:19:56,192
- No, if we're gonna talk
about what we did,

347
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:57,660
then we have to call it
what it is.

348
00:19:57,662 --> 00:19:59,428
It's stupid.
It's so fucking stupid.

349
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,831
It's the stupidest
I've ever fucking been.

350
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,833
- Reynard set us up.

351
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:05,835
- Yeah, but I should have
known better.

352
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:09,772
You know, I knew the difference
between magic and miracles.

353
00:20:09,774 --> 00:20:13,709
One is real and one is
a lie with sparkles.

354
00:20:13,711 --> 00:20:18,247
Like a nice female god was
gonna glide in and save...

355
00:20:18,249 --> 00:20:21,383
It sounds so naive
to ever believe in that.

356
00:20:21,385 --> 00:20:23,853
- Look, there is
one way through this,

357
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:27,289
and that is to find out
what happened 40 years ago.

358
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:29,191
- Yeah, and banish the fuck
out of Reynard.

359
00:20:29,193 --> 00:20:32,728
- Yeah, so let's just get this
pesky abortion out of the way,

360
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,131
and that's next on the list.

361
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:37,600
- I know this is
a straightforward procedure.

362
00:20:37,602 --> 00:20:40,603
It's probably, you know,
the simplest thing

363
00:20:40,605 --> 00:20:43,739
I've had to deal with in months.

364
00:20:43,741 --> 00:20:46,142
But I am nervous.

365
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,249
- I had one.

366
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:58,754
He was a drummer.

367
00:21:00,624 --> 00:21:03,592
And he said he couldn't
get it up with a condom.

368
00:21:05,395 --> 00:21:07,363
But...

369
00:21:07,365 --> 00:21:11,901
I... I remember the night before.

370
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:14,904
It... I felt...

371
00:21:17,174 --> 00:21:18,841
I felt lonely.

372
00:21:21,611 --> 00:21:23,445
- Yeah.

373
00:21:23,447 --> 00:21:26,182
- But you're not alone.

374
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:28,350
I'm your best bitch, remember?

375
00:21:31,188 --> 00:21:32,621
- Yeah.

376
00:21:32,623 --> 00:21:36,258
- Okay, your turn.
- Truth or dare.

377
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,761
- Truth.

378
00:21:38,763 --> 00:21:40,896
- Do you still blame yourself?

379
00:21:40,898 --> 00:21:43,532
- Shit. Okay.

380
00:21:43,534 --> 00:21:44,833
- Sorry, no.

381
00:21:44,835 --> 00:21:47,970
I think I'm drunker
than I think I am.

382
00:21:47,972 --> 00:21:49,672
Was that a sentence?

383
00:21:49,674 --> 00:21:52,741
- No, I said truth.

384
00:21:52,743 --> 00:21:56,946
So do you know what happened?

385
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:58,614
- I mean, just what
Alice told me.

386
00:21:58,616 --> 00:22:02,318
That you changed your face
for a professor

387
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,821
and it got screwed up
and Charlie tried to save you.

388
00:22:05,823 --> 00:22:08,257
- Yeah, that's the gist.

389
00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:11,694
How is Alice?

390
00:22:11,696 --> 00:22:13,963
- Uh, Alice is dead.

391
00:22:24,841 --> 00:22:27,610
- I don't blame myself.

392
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:31,413
Except for when
I first wake up...

393
00:22:31,415 --> 00:22:32,915
And when I go to bed

394
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:37,953
and all the time in between.

395
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:44,393
Your turn.

396
00:22:46,596 --> 00:22:48,497
- Dare.

397
00:22:48,499 --> 00:22:50,399
- Dare.

398
00:22:53,871 --> 00:22:55,537
My dare is to smoke weed?

399
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:57,973
It's very middle school.

400
00:23:00,944 --> 00:23:03,412
- Oh, oh.

401
00:23:03,414 --> 00:23:05,581
Do you know...

402
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:07,016
Do you know Weizenheim's third?

403
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:09,718
It's a tiny, little
weather suspension spell.

404
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,820
- I thought you didn't...
- I don't.

405
00:23:11,822 --> 00:23:13,589
This doesn't count.

406
00:23:13,591 --> 00:23:14,957
Today's a cheat day.

407
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:17,493
- Right.

408
00:23:17,495 --> 00:23:21,363
- Oh, the trick to this one
is that you enchant your lips.

409
00:23:33,009 --> 00:23:36,378
- And you're a smoke artiste.
- Mm. Okay.

410
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,546
- Your turn.

411
00:23:37,548 --> 00:23:38,914
Don't, like, burn yourself.

412
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:41,317
- Okay, how do you do it?
- Oh, um...

413
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,484
Okay, let me.

414
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,940
You're a fucking dork.

415
00:24:04,942 --> 00:24:07,409
You're just jealous that
I'm such a quick study.

416
00:24:07,411 --> 00:24:10,412
Yeah.

417
00:24:10,414 --> 00:24:12,414
Okay.

418
00:24:20,924 --> 00:24:22,691
- What is that?

419
00:24:22,693 --> 00:24:24,760
- This one's my favorite.

420
00:24:33,737 --> 00:24:35,771
- That's my favorite, too.

421
00:24:39,843 --> 00:24:41,610
- Ooh!
- Come on in.

422
00:24:41,612 --> 00:24:43,946
- Okay.

423
00:24:43,948 --> 00:24:46,582
Emily Greenstreet,

424
00:24:46,584 --> 00:24:48,984
living the loft life, huh?

425
00:24:48,986 --> 00:24:51,387
Yeah.

426
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:52,454
Wine opener?

427
00:24:52,456 --> 00:24:54,723
- One of those drawers.
- One of the...

428
00:24:54,725 --> 00:24:56,992
- wine opener.

429
00:24:56,994 --> 00:25:00,129
Ahh, wine opener, wine opener.

430
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:02,831
- Hey.

431
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:07,002
I wanna do a spell.

432
00:25:07,004 --> 00:25:08,837
- Why don't we keep drinking

433
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:12,941
and make some really,
really bad decisions?

434
00:25:12,943 --> 00:25:15,744
That sounds, I don't know,
kind of fun.

435
00:25:15,746 --> 00:25:19,581
- Yeah. You'll like it.

436
00:25:19,583 --> 00:25:22,751
- Mm.
- Come on.

437
00:25:22,753 --> 00:25:24,820
Cheat day.

438
00:25:28,023 --> 00:25:29,890
- The defenestration
. Of Prague.

439
00:25:29,892 --> 00:25:30,991
- No, you already said that.

440
00:25:30,993 --> 00:25:32,426
- There were two.
- Mm.

441
00:25:32,428 --> 00:25:34,795
- Look, any hope you had
of saving this guy

442
00:25:34,797 --> 00:25:36,130
is out the window.

443
00:25:36,132 --> 00:25:40,801
Like the guys in Prague.

444
00:25:40,803 --> 00:25:42,203
- Shit.

445
00:25:42,205 --> 00:25:47,975
- Eliot, we said we'd do
whatever actually works.

446
00:25:47,977 --> 00:25:51,112
- Fine. We'll tell the council
in the morning.

447
00:25:51,114 --> 00:25:52,279
But I'll do it.

448
00:25:52,281 --> 00:25:55,015
The man's life
is my burden to bear.

449
00:25:55,017 --> 00:26:00,888
- Get over yourself, Ned stark.

450
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,523
Ned stark.

451
00:26:14,035 --> 00:26:16,437
- Do you even like magic?

452
00:26:16,439 --> 00:26:18,539
- Yeah, like...

453
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:23,177
Like I like money or food
or any other useful shit.

454
00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:25,780
- Money and food
don't explode in your face.

455
00:26:25,782 --> 00:26:29,416
You came to Brakebills
only to ease your suffering.

456
00:26:29,418 --> 00:26:33,120
The voices.
It was all chore and burden.

457
00:26:33,122 --> 00:26:36,190
But you saved yourself,
traveler.

458
00:26:36,192 --> 00:26:38,859
Good.

459
00:26:38,861 --> 00:26:41,262
Maybe you're simply done.

460
00:26:41,264 --> 00:26:45,432
Now's your chance.
Walk away.

461
00:26:45,434 --> 00:26:49,103
- Why? Chance at what?

462
00:26:49,105 --> 00:26:52,807
- Few years of happy life.

463
00:26:54,811 --> 00:27:00,080
- There is bad surprise
in store for everyone.

464
00:27:00,082 --> 00:27:03,484
- What surprise?

465
00:27:03,486 --> 00:27:08,422
- Energy current
should be constant.

466
00:27:10,091 --> 00:27:14,962
- But it's not.
- Why?

467
00:27:14,964 --> 00:27:17,164
- There is something
happening to magic.

468
00:27:17,166 --> 00:27:19,466
- The wellspring in Fillory.

469
00:27:19,468 --> 00:27:22,937
- The current is sputtering.
- And they're trying to fix it.

470
00:27:22,939 --> 00:27:25,172
- Maybe it's going to disappear.

471
00:27:25,174 --> 00:27:27,541
- If that's the case...
- Shit could get real.

472
00:27:27,543 --> 00:27:32,012
- If magic goes, it will be
very bad time to be magician,

473
00:27:32,014 --> 00:27:35,616
so consider the advantage
of getting out now.

474
00:27:35,618 --> 00:27:37,551
- All right.
- Okay, thank you.

475
00:27:37,553 --> 00:27:40,621
I'll meditate on it.
I...

476
00:27:40,623 --> 00:27:43,524
Right now, I'm staying.

477
00:27:43,526 --> 00:27:48,028
- Then you're just fancy scarf
wrapped around an idiot.

478
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,564
- You know what?
- If it's so bad, you get out!

479
00:27:50,566 --> 00:27:53,267
You leave, I'll leave.

480
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:56,403
- I cannot leave.
- Thanks for reminder.

481
00:27:56,405 --> 00:27:59,607
- What... what,
you're trapped here?

482
00:27:59,609 --> 00:28:02,109
- Remarkably like that.

483
00:28:02,111 --> 00:28:04,245
Incorporate bond.

484
00:28:04,247 --> 00:28:06,447
Even I cannot break.

485
00:28:06,449 --> 00:28:08,382
- Why?

486
00:28:08,384 --> 00:28:12,353
What did you do?

487
00:28:12,355 --> 00:28:15,356
- I'm not drunk enough
to talk about it.

488
00:28:20,629 --> 00:28:25,032
Okay!

489
00:28:25,034 --> 00:28:27,101
I make love to many students.

490
00:28:27,103 --> 00:28:31,605
And then I fucked the wrong one.

491
00:28:31,607 --> 00:28:34,008
Oops.

492
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:37,011
- They sent you here?
- God.

493
00:28:37,013 --> 00:28:38,579
- It was that...

494
00:28:42,584 --> 00:28:45,419
Or give up magic.

495
00:28:45,421 --> 00:28:48,589
- Like you're telling me to.
- Yes.

496
00:28:48,591 --> 00:28:51,191
<i>I made my choice.</i>

497
00:29:06,241 --> 00:29:09,076
Wakey, wakey.

498
00:29:09,078 --> 00:29:12,212
You have 15 minutes
to save your life.

499
00:29:12,214 --> 00:29:15,382
Tell me, if you were in charge,

500
00:29:15,384 --> 00:29:18,652
how would the FU fighters
fix Fillory?

501
00:29:20,221 --> 00:29:22,623
- It's an illusion spell.

502
00:29:22,625 --> 00:29:24,358
Party trick, really.
It'll only last

503
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,494
as long as your skin's wet.

504
00:29:27,496 --> 00:58:54,990
You first.

505
00:29:27,496 --> 00:29:32,132
- Yeah. You know, this is
the weirdest foreplay.

506
00:29:32,134 --> 00:29:34,435
- Oh, my god. Stop.

507
00:29:34,437 --> 00:29:36,704
Robe off!

508
00:29:40,042 --> 00:29:42,977
Whoa, what is that?

509
00:29:42,979 --> 00:29:44,378
- Oh, right, uh...

510
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,013
- You joined some kinda gang?

511
00:29:46,015 --> 00:29:47,982
- Yes.

512
00:29:47,984 --> 00:29:49,416
- Okay.

513
00:29:49,418 --> 00:29:52,052
Hop in.

514
00:30:16,644 --> 00:30:19,346
Did it work?

515
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,121
Oh, shit.

516
00:30:27,123 --> 00:30:28,555
- Don't judge me, please.

517
00:30:28,557 --> 00:30:32,593
- I'm not. I'm just
putting it all together.

518
00:30:32,595 --> 00:30:35,362
You, Charlie.

519
00:30:35,364 --> 00:30:38,165
That's why he's
at Brakebills south.

520
00:30:38,167 --> 00:30:39,600
I mean, I had a lot of theories.

521
00:30:39,602 --> 00:30:41,668
- Shh.

522
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:43,804
You're ruining it.

523
00:30:43,806 --> 00:30:48,575
Just tell me what you think
when you look at me.

524
00:30:48,577 --> 00:30:52,346
And can you maybe try
a Russian accent?

525
00:31:03,124 --> 00:31:06,460
- You didn't wanna...

526
00:31:06,462 --> 00:31:08,796
- This is what I miss the most.

527
00:31:13,768 --> 00:31:17,204
So...

528
00:31:17,206 --> 00:31:18,839
Your turn.

529
00:31:43,364 --> 00:31:46,500
- It's her.

530
00:31:46,502 --> 00:31:48,435
It's your memories.

531
00:31:51,506 --> 00:31:55,609
Well?
Anything you wanna say?

532
00:31:57,545 --> 00:32:00,714
- I just really
fucking miss you.

533
00:32:51,933 --> 00:32:54,701
What...

534
00:32:54,703 --> 00:32:58,605
- Is that?
- Yeah.

535
00:33:00,607 --> 00:33:03,542
Um, hey, I...
I've gotta get home.

536
00:33:03,544 --> 00:33:06,178
Um...

537
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,779
I had a good time.

538
00:33:07,781 --> 00:33:10,549
- You don't have to go.
- We can do it again.

539
00:33:10,551 --> 00:33:12,217
- You said yesterday
was cheat day.

540
00:33:12,219 --> 00:33:13,919
You can't...

541
00:33:13,921 --> 00:33:16,688
You can't cheat every day.

542
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:19,291
- I won't tell.

543
00:33:19,293 --> 00:33:22,694
No, I don't want to.

544
00:33:22,696 --> 00:33:25,263
- So, what, you're...
- Done with me?

545
00:33:25,265 --> 00:33:27,832
I... I was helping you.

546
00:33:27,834 --> 00:33:29,601
- That's not what I said.

547
00:33:29,603 --> 00:33:32,737
- Tell me, then.
- What are you saying?

548
00:33:35,441 --> 00:33:38,243
- Last night was...

549
00:33:41,314 --> 00:33:43,715
It felt really good,
and it was...

550
00:33:45,685 --> 00:33:49,521
Probably exactly what I needed,
but I...

551
00:33:49,523 --> 00:33:54,392
It was also really weird and sad
and I feel awful.

552
00:33:54,394 --> 00:33:58,263
I feel worse than before.

553
00:33:58,265 --> 00:34:00,432
- Apologies
for my terrible life.

554
00:34:03,636 --> 00:34:06,538
- I just don't wanna
use magic like that.

555
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,812
I'm sorry for
everything you lost.

556
00:34:18,384 --> 00:34:20,752
I'll see you at work.

557
00:34:28,561 --> 00:34:33,465
- It is after much deliberation
that I have decided...

558
00:34:33,467 --> 00:34:35,567
We will not
execute the prisoner.

559
00:34:35,569 --> 00:34:36,935
- What?

560
00:34:36,937 --> 00:34:39,704
Your majesty, I'm...

561
00:34:39,706 --> 00:34:41,539
- It is in Fillory's
best interest.

562
00:34:41,541 --> 00:34:44,743
- We agreed to have the prisoner
executed today.

563
00:34:44,745 --> 00:34:47,812
- We did.
- But I changed my mind.

564
00:34:49,882 --> 00:34:52,317
- Well, I didn't.

565
00:34:52,319 --> 00:34:53,551
And I'm high queen.

566
00:34:53,553 --> 00:34:55,520
- The queen may
voice her opinion,

567
00:34:55,522 --> 00:34:59,324
but ultimate judgment
belongs to the king.

568
00:34:59,326 --> 00:35:03,928
- So this is what
the patriarchy smells like?

569
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:06,364
It's not the freshest.

570
00:35:08,401 --> 00:35:10,802
You are a king.
Act like it.

571
00:35:10,804 --> 00:35:13,805
- I'm not just a king.

572
00:35:13,807 --> 00:35:15,473
Fen's pregnant.

573
00:35:15,475 --> 00:35:18,610
I'm gonna be a father.

574
00:35:19,912 --> 00:35:22,981
Mm.

575
00:35:22,983 --> 00:35:24,949
And I would like
to raise my child

576
00:35:24,951 --> 00:35:30,422
in a world that does not just
kill its problems away.

577
00:35:30,424 --> 00:35:34,926
We hear them and we
address them accordingly.

578
00:35:34,928 --> 00:35:37,095
- That is fucking stupid.

579
00:35:37,097 --> 00:35:39,564
You wanna rule a kingdom?
Guess what.

580
00:35:39,566 --> 00:35:43,435
People are gonna die
no matter what.

581
00:35:43,437 --> 00:35:46,371
Just trying to make sure
that it isn't you, okay?

582
00:35:54,714 --> 00:35:56,514
<i>- Julia, I'll check you in.</i>

583
00:35:56,516 --> 00:35:58,483
<i>Dr. Higgins will be
ready shortly.</i>

584
00:36:00,019 --> 00:36:01,786
Okay.

585
00:36:15,601 --> 00:36:17,635
I'm sorry, you're not in here.

586
00:36:17,637 --> 01:12:35,272
- Excuse me?

587
00:36:17,637 --> 00:36:20,705
- You don't have an appointment.

588
00:36:20,707 --> 00:36:23,007
- The doctor gave me one.
- I mean, there must be a mistake.

589
00:36:23,009 --> 00:36:25,643
- I'm sorry, but without an
appointment, I can't let you in.

590
00:36:25,645 --> 00:36:28,113
- Look, it's wicker.
- Julia wicker.

591
00:36:28,115 --> 00:36:29,748
You just said my name
two seconds ago.

592
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:31,783
Can you just pick up the phone
and ask her?

593
00:36:35,988 --> 00:36:39,090
- Doctor, there's a woman
claiming she's a patient.

594
00:36:39,092 --> 00:36:40,525
No, she doesn't.

595
00:36:40,527 --> 00:36:43,795
Uh, Julia wicker.

596
00:36:43,797 --> 00:36:45,797
But, doctor...

597
00:36:45,799 --> 00:36:48,600
Okay.

598
00:36:48,602 --> 00:36:51,603
- You can go ahead.
- Yeah, thanks.

599
00:36:51,605 --> 00:36:54,639
- I'll be right here.

600
00:37:07,826 --> 00:37:11,128
. - No geese!

601
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:13,130
Oh.

602
00:37:13,132 --> 00:37:15,666
Phew.

603
00:37:15,668 --> 00:37:18,169
You finish table.
Good work.

604
00:37:18,171 --> 00:37:20,905
- Yeah, so can we get to this?

605
00:37:20,907 --> 00:37:23,641
Enough "karate kid" bullshit.

606
00:37:23,643 --> 00:37:25,943
- Not bullshit.

607
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:30,281
Ask yourself a question:

608
00:37:30,283 --> 00:37:34,252
What will a magician need
if dark days come?

609
00:37:34,254 --> 00:37:36,621
Magic.

610
00:37:36,623 --> 00:37:37,989
But if it is gone,
it is gone, you say.

611
00:37:37,991 --> 00:37:41,792
Not so, if you store it
like a battery.

612
00:37:41,794 --> 00:37:44,095
That's what I am building.

613
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:53,671
Those knots?

614
00:37:53,673 --> 00:37:56,073
Old class project,
tied with magic.

615
00:37:56,075 --> 00:38:00,077
That table, stained
through with magic.

616
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:05,082
You release the energy,
I store it for rainy day.

617
00:38:05,084 --> 00:38:09,320
- So my hands, are you
gonna teach me or what?

618
00:38:09,322 --> 00:38:12,857
- You can travel to Fillory.

619
00:38:14,893 --> 00:38:17,061
- It's the worst place
in the universe, yeah.

620
00:38:17,063 --> 00:38:20,698
- You go there.
- Get this.

621
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,934
- Moss. You need moss.

622
00:38:22,936 --> 00:38:25,703
- It's amazing.
- Can carry current.

623
00:38:25,705 --> 00:38:29,907
- Do not care.

624
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:35,079
I'll get it.

625
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,589
- Gods, it's good to see you.

626
00:38:44,591 --> 00:38:45,856
- You asshole!

627
00:38:45,858 --> 00:38:47,725
You come here with no warning

628
00:38:47,727 --> 00:38:49,260
and try to kill my husband.

629
00:38:49,262 --> 00:38:51,629
- Of course I did.

630
00:38:51,631 --> 00:38:53,230
I thought you were waiting.

631
00:38:53,232 --> 00:38:55,232
- I'm not a FU fighter anymore.

632
00:38:55,234 --> 00:38:57,201
You always knew
that one day I'd have to...

633
00:38:57,203 --> 00:39:00,838
- marry him, yes, and then
you'd be here, on the inside.

634
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:05,610
You can't tell me that you don't
care about Fillory anymore.

635
00:39:05,612 --> 00:39:07,345
- I'm pregnant.

636
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:13,150
- Then for the child.
- What?

637
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:15,286
- All I ask is you get us
information we need to...

638
00:39:15,288 --> 00:39:17,755
- Bayler!

639
00:39:17,757 --> 00:39:20,224
- Did I say "ask"?

640
00:39:20,226 --> 00:39:22,293
I meant help us.

641
00:39:22,295 --> 00:39:25,630
Or I go to your king
and tell him exactly how well

642
00:39:25,632 --> 00:39:27,665
I know his wife.

643
00:39:27,667 --> 00:39:29,800
- Then I'll tell him myself.

644
00:39:29,802 --> 00:39:33,337
- Word travels fast
about the high king.

645
00:39:33,339 --> 00:39:35,306
Emotional.

646
00:39:35,308 --> 00:39:37,408
Easily wounded.

647
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:40,177
Try it and see.

648
00:39:40,179 --> 00:39:42,980
Or help the cause.

649
00:39:48,321 --> 00:39:50,354
- If the FU fighters
make another move,

650
00:39:50,356 --> 00:39:52,390
I'll kill you myself.

651
00:40:00,198 --> 00:40:02,700
- That should do it.

652
00:40:02,702 --> 00:40:04,301
How are you feeling?

653
00:40:04,303 --> 00:40:10,207
- Like I finally understand why
people take these kind of drugs.

654
00:40:10,209 --> 00:40:11,842
- Okay, we'll start
the procedure.

655
00:40:11,844 --> 00:40:12,943
You may feel some cramping,

656
00:40:12,945 --> 00:40:15,179
and that's perfectly normal.

657
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:30,361
- What... what's wrong?

658
00:40:30,363 --> 00:40:33,864
- Morning cobwebs.
- Excuse me.

659
00:40:33,866 --> 00:40:37,301
- Just relax.
- Okay.

660
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:03,994
What are you doing?

661
00:41:08,934 --> 00:41:10,501
Wait.

662
00:41:12,738 --> 00:41:13,871
Stop.

663
00:41:17,143 --> 00:41:18,876
- Stop it! Wait!
- I can't.

664
00:41:18,878 --> 00:41:20,745
- Stop!
- What are you doing? No!

665
00:41:20,747 --> 00:41:21,746
Kady!

666
00:41:21,748 --> 00:41:23,080
Kady!

667
00:41:23,082 --> 00:41:24,782
Kady!

668
00:41:24,784 --> 00:41:27,985
- I can't...
- Stop!

669
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:39,396
- Oh, my god.

670
00:41:39,398 --> 00:41:42,767
Holy fuck.

671
00:41:42,769 --> 00:41:46,871
Oh, my...

672
00:41:46,873 --> 00:41:48,172
- Do it.
- What?

673
00:41:48,174 --> 00:41:49,774
- Do it. You have wards.

674
00:41:49,776 --> 00:41:52,042
The thing, it got to her.
Just get it out of me, Kady.

675
00:41:52,044 --> 00:41:53,310
- Julia, that is a dead body.

676
00:41:53,312 --> 00:41:56,313
We need to get rid of it
right now.

677
00:41:56,315 --> 00:41:58,048
Fuck, Jules.

678
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:00,151
We will find another way.
