00:09:31,866 --> 00:09:36,468
- you're left with--
- A big fucking problem.

182
00:09:39,106 --> 00:09:42,908
Oh, shit.
I have a meeting in 15.

183
00:09:42,943 --> 00:09:44,743
Ooh.

184
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:47,112
[light whooshing]

185
00:09:47,148 --> 00:09:49,014
I'm sorry.
That was just reflex.

186
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,584
Uh, that--I--um...

187
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,855
Just--just put this
on the company card.

188
00:09:56,891 --> 00:09:58,490
They won't notice.

189
00:09:58,526 --> 00:10:00,893
[sighs]

190
00:10:00,928 --> 00:10:02,594
<i>I am happy.</i>

191
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:04,563
Yay, a baby.

192
00:10:04,598 --> 00:10:07,232
Eliot, what is this about?

193
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,204
I really wanna know.

194
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:16,608
[sighs]
My father was not the best...

195
00:10:16,644 --> 00:10:18,043
Wine, Your Majesty.

196
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,778
Bad dad.

197
00:10:19,814 --> 00:10:24,550
So I suppose I don't
exactly have the proper,

198
00:10:24,585 --> 00:10:26,552
uh, uh...

199
00:10:26,587 --> 00:10:28,120
template to--

200
00:10:28,155 --> 00:10:30,022
- Ahh!
- [screams]

201
00:10:30,057 --> 00:10:32,257
Quiet!

202
00:10:32,293 --> 00:10:34,960
You are not welcome here,
child of Earth.

203
00:10:37,164 --> 00:10:38,263
Eliot!

204
00:10:38,299 --> 00:10:39,698
[groaning]

205
00:10:39,734 --> 00:10:41,667
[grunting]

206
00:10:47,608 --> 00:10:50,109
Wait.

207
00:10:50,144 --> 00:10:52,077
This is not over,
child of Earth.

208
00:10:56,684 --> 00:10:58,584
Dungeon.

209
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,921
What the hell was that about?

210
00:11:02,957 --> 00:11:06,058
I tried expressing my emotions.

211
00:11:06,093 --> 00:11:08,193
Lesson learned.

212
00:11:11,894 --> 00:11:16,364
Shittiest security ever.

213
00:11:16,882 --> 00:11:18,816
So what are we supposed to do?

214
00:11:18,851 --> 00:11:21,452
- Ship 'em back to Loria?
- Actually, Your Highness,

215
00:11:21,487 --> 00:11:23,220
he's not from Loria.

216
00:11:23,256 --> 00:11:24,922
He's a native Fillorian.

217
00:11:24,957 --> 00:11:27,524
My own people
are trying to kill me?

218
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,660
Hmm.
So French.

219
00:11:29,695 --> 00:11:32,429
They're commoners.
Not to worry.

220
00:11:32,465 --> 00:11:34,932
Oh, whoa, whoa.
I'm worried.

221
00:11:34,967 --> 00:11:38,235
I urge
a public execution, today.

222
00:11:38,271 --> 00:11:40,771
Might I suggest strangulation?

223
00:11:40,806 --> 00:11:42,339
For the symbolism.

224
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,707
We don't wish
to fall to his level.

225
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,976
The Bed of a Thousand Spikes
should do just fine.

226
00:11:46,012 --> 00:11:50,714
[whispering indistinctly]

227
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:55,352
Her Slowness suggests tying
each of his limbs to a centaur,

228
00:11:55,388 --> 00:11:58,289
and as they stretch him,
inch by inch,

229
00:11:58,324 --> 00:12:02,860
a fifth centaur sets the spike,
if you will.

230
00:12:02,895 --> 00:12:04,528
Jesus, no.

231
00:12:04,563 --> 00:12:07,398
Everyone out. This is a matter
for the Queen and me.

232
00:12:08,901 --> 00:12:11,935
That sloth is psychotic.

233
00:12:11,971 --> 00:12:14,471
It's all psychotic.
[sighs]

234
00:12:14,507 --> 00:12:16,907
Did you hear how Tick
said "commoners"?

235
00:12:16,942 --> 00:12:19,243
When we're the least snobby
people in a room,

236
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:21,612
there's something wrong
with the room.

237
00:12:21,647 --> 00:12:23,947
[knocking]

238
00:12:28,788 --> 00:12:30,354
Yes?

239
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:32,856
I wanted to apologize.

240
00:12:32,892 --> 00:12:36,360
I'm sorry, um...

241
00:12:36,395 --> 00:12:37,995
Okay.

242
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,833
What?

243
00:12:42,868 --> 00:12:48,639
I just--I don't know
if you accepted my apology.

244
00:12:48,674 --> 00:12:51,875
Yes.

245
00:12:51,911 --> 00:12:54,578
- Okay.
- Actually, no.

246
00:12:54,613 --> 00:12:57,014
No, I don't.

247
00:12:57,049 --> 00:12:59,817
We had just talked about
how terrible magic is,

248
00:12:59,852 --> 00:13:02,286
and then you went and did it.

249
00:13:02,321 --> 00:13:04,588
It was just a tiny spell.

250
00:13:04,623 --> 00:13:06,390
There are a lot
of companies like this.

251
00:13:06,425 --> 00:13:08,659
I'm sure Fogg can find
another one for you.

252
00:13:10,796 --> 00:13:12,463
[sighs]

253
00:13:12,498 --> 00:13:13,897
Okay.

254
00:13:19,004 --> 00:13:21,772
[mouse clicking]

255
00:13:31,484 --> 00:13:32,850
<i>They're useless, right?</i>

256
00:13:32,885 --> 00:13:36,820
Well, maybe not useless.

257
00:13:39,558 --> 00:13:42,393
You can still grab hold
of things, wave hello,

258
00:13:42,428 --> 00:13:44,094
rub away a lonely night.

259
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,496
Okay, but for magic?

260
00:13:45,531 --> 00:13:47,398
For magic? Useless.

261
00:13:49,802 --> 00:13:51,769
How was your travel?

262
00:13:51,804 --> 00:13:53,937
Fine.

263
00:13:53,973 --> 00:13:57,107
Aim's good. I just can't
take people with me.

264
00:13:57,143 --> 00:13:59,076
Some might call that blessing.

265
00:13:59,111 --> 00:14:01,612
Yeah, well the option
would be nice, so--

266
00:14:01,647 --> 00:14:03,547
I mean, can you help me?
What are we doing here?

267
00:14:03,582 --> 00:14:05,315
I can help you.

268
00:14:05,351 --> 00:14:08,452
But first, your end of deal.

269
00:14:18,497 --> 00:14:20,597
Take out all the knots.

270
00:14:22,902 --> 00:14:25,936
What the hell?

271
00:14:25,971 --> 00:14:30,140
- Ms. Wicker.
- Uh, Julia.

272
00:14:30,176 --> 00:14:33,577
The test was positive.

273
00:14:33,612 --> 00:14:36,113
If you'd like, we can
discuss your options.

274
00:14:36,148 --> 00:14:38,649
- I want an abortion.
- Okay.

275
00:14:38,684 --> 00:14:40,818
That's something that we can
perform here in office.

276
00:14:40,853 --> 00:14:43,921
Great. Uh, today?

277
00:14:43,956 --> 00:14:45,689
Unfortunately, we do have
a waiting list,

278
00:14:45,724 --> 00:14:47,424
but it should just be
a couple of days.

279
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,527
Days?

280
00:14:50,563 --> 00:14:53,163
Doctor, I can't wait
a couple of days.

281
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,666
Please, I--

282
00:14:57,603 --> 00:15:02,639
If I suspect abuse,
I'm obligated to report it.

283
00:15:02,675 --> 00:15:04,508
Julia, you're safe here.

284
00:15:04,543 --> 00:15:06,910
You can talk about
what happened.

285
00:15:06,946 --> 00:15:11,515
- No one is above the law.
- [laughs]

286
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,784
Ah, sorry.

287
00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:17,554
I wish that were true.

288
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:20,023
Look, I just want this
to be over,

289
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:23,527
and you can help me.

290
00:15:23,562 --> 00:15:26,463
Please.

291
00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:28,532
Okay.

292
00:15:28,567 --> 00:15:30,868
We'll set you up
for an ultrasound today.

293
00:15:30,903 --> 00:15:34,004
Tomorrow, you can perform
the procedure.

294
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:36,473
We open at 8:00.

295
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:39,610
- Thank you.
- See you then.

296
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:44,815
[door clicks closed]

297
00:15:50,763 --> 00:15:51,696
Hi.

298
00:15:51,732 --> 00:15:53,131
Leave.

299
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:55,734
- You don't get to say that.
- And why not?

300
00:15:55,769 --> 00:15:58,036
Uh, because
you're in our castle.

301
00:15:58,071 --> 00:16:00,205
Which is on my land.

302
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,974
Uh, excuse me, my manners.

303
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,910
I'm Eliot, High King of Fillory.

304
00:16:04,945 --> 00:16:09,814
And I'm Bayler, a proud
soldier of Fillorians United.

305
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:12,083
A FU fighter.

306
00:16:12,119 --> 00:16:14,953
- Did you say, "Foo Fighter"?
- Margo, behave.

307
00:16:14,988 --> 00:16:18,290
We will not rest until a
Fillorian sits upon the throne.

308
00:16:18,325 --> 00:16:20,992
Okay, tell Ember.

309
00:16:21,028 --> 00:16:22,260
He issued the decree.

310
00:16:22,296 --> 00:16:25,197
We will execute
every child of Earth

311
00:16:25,232 --> 00:16:28,767
that crosses into our land until
there are none left to kill.

312
00:16:28,802 --> 00:16:31,670
- [laughs]
- And yet, you laugh.

313
00:16:33,907 --> 00:16:36,241
- I mean, a Foo Fighter?
- Margo.

314
00:16:36,276 --> 00:16:40,111
If we execute him,
then he's a martyr.

315
00:16:40,147 --> 00:16:42,147
Shit.

316
00:16:42,182 --> 00:16:44,115
When was the last time
either of us dealt with

317
00:16:44,151 --> 00:16:46,284
a political insurgency?

318
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,254
Unless getting kicked out
of a fivesome counts.

319
00:16:49,289 --> 00:16:50,922
- First for me.
- Same.

320
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,225
I'm thinking we should
probably bone up.

321
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,026
Like, study?

322
00:16:55,062 --> 00:16:56,962
I'll grab what I can from
the Brakebills Library.

323
00:16:56,997 --> 00:16:58,263
[groans] Fine.

324
00:16:58,298 --> 00:17:01,099
And grab some Adderall
while you're there.

325
00:17:09,643 --> 00:17:13,278
Okay, I'm done.

326
00:17:13,313 --> 00:17:15,914
Oh, shit! What?
Do not--don't--please--

327
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:17,649
don't sneak up on me like that.

328
00:17:17,684 --> 00:17:19,184
This is my house.

329
00:17:19,219 --> 00:17:21,052
Look, I finished untying
your bondage kit.

330
00:17:21,088 --> 00:17:22,254
You gonna teach me now?

331
00:17:22,289 --> 00:17:24,889
You finish first step.

332
00:17:24,925 --> 00:17:28,159
Next...the table.

333
00:17:30,897 --> 00:17:32,397
What about it?

334
00:17:32,432 --> 00:17:34,766
You make it sawdust.

335
00:17:34,801 --> 00:17:39,170
Do not worry.
I give you tool.

336
00:17:39,206 --> 00:17:41,239
Enjoy.

337
00:17:46,246 --> 00:17:47,846
[sputters]

338
00:17:54,454 --> 00:17:57,455
What are you still doing here?

339
00:17:57,491 --> 00:17:59,391
I'm just finishing up.

340
00:17:59,426 --> 00:18:00,992
Gonna jerk it?

341
00:18:01,028 --> 00:18:02,861
- Break in the office?
- No.

342
00:18:02,896 --> 00:18:03,995
What? No, I'm--

343
00:18:04,031 --> 00:18:05,163
It's the only place I can.

344
00:18:05,198 --> 00:18:08,867
Wife and two kids?
No privacy at home.

345
00:18:08,902 --> 00:18:11,936
I'm not doing that...

346
00:18:11,972 --> 00:18:13,071
here.

347
00:18:13,106 --> 00:18:15,140
Just saying.
It's no judgment.

348
00:18:15,175 --> 00:18:17,809
Adios.

349
00:18:17,844 --> 00:18:19,377
[door rattles closed]

350
00:18:21,815 --> 00:18:25,283
I owe you an apology
for being a bitch.

351
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:28,019
Could you knock, please?

352
00:18:28,055 --> 00:18:29,421
[knocks]

353
00:18:29,456 --> 00:18:31,423
What? Were you masturbating
in your office?

354
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,024
No!

355
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,093
Whatever. I do.

356
00:18:35,128 --> 00:18:36,961
What is this place?

357
00:18:36,997 --> 00:18:38,763
[sighs]

358
00:18:41,335 --> 00:18:43,234
I'm sorry, again,
about the spell, I--

359
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,938
I'm sorry
for making you feel sorry.

360
00:18:46,973 --> 00:18:51,743
It was just a stupid spell.

361
00:18:51,778 --> 00:18:53,244
Thank you.

362
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,879
Want some?

363
00:18:54,915 --> 00:18:56,915
Vodka. Bit of lime.

364
00:19:01,955 --> 00:19:03,788
You should stay.

365
00:19:03,824 --> 00:19:04,989
Forget what I said earlier.

366
00:19:05,025 --> 00:19:09,361
I think we'd be good friends.

367
00:19:09,396 --> 00:19:11,896
I would like that.

368
00:19:11,932 --> 00:19:13,965
What the hell are we
still doing in the office?

369
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,368
Right?
Let's get out of here.

370
00:19:16,403 --> 00:19:17,736
- Mm.
- Finish that.

371
00:19:17,771 --> 00:19:19,804
- Come on.
- Okay.

372
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,339
Yes!

373
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:24,376
[file scraping]

374
00:19:28,215 --> 00:19:29,948
Take a break.

375
00:19:31,451 --> 00:19:33,818
No trick, no test.
I promise.

376
00:19:42,295 --> 00:19:43,828
That's it?

377
00:19:43,864 --> 00:19:46,998
Take your balls out
of your purse and drink.

378
00:19:49,903 --> 00:19:51,936
No, if we're gonna talk
about what we did,

379
00:19:51,972 --> 00:19:53,304
then we have to call it
what it is.

380
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,240
It's stupid.
It's so fucking stupid.

381
00:19:55,275 --> 00:19:57,342
It's the stupidest
I've ever fucking been.

382
00:19:57,377 --> 00:19:59,544
Reynard set us up.

383
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:01,546
Yeah, but I should have
known better.

384
00:20:01,581 --> 00:20:05,450
You know, I knew the difference
between magic and miracles.

385
00:20:05,485 --> 00:20:09,354
One is real and one is
a lie with sparkles.

386
00:20:09,389 --> 00:20:13,992
Like a nice female god was
gonna glide in and save--

387
00:20:14,027 --> 00:20:16,961
It sounds so naive
to ever believe in that.

388
00:20:16,997 --> 00:20:19,531
Look, there is
one way through this,

389
00:20:19,566 --> 00:20:23,034
and that is to find out
what happened 40 years ago.

390
00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:24,969
Yeah, and banish the fuck
out of Reynard.

391
00:20:25,005 --> 00:20:28,440
Yeah, so let's just get this
pesky abortion out of the way,

392
00:20:28,475 --> 00:20:30,875
and that's next on the list.

393
00:20:30,911 --> 00:20:33,244
I know this is
a straightforward procedure.

394
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,281
It's probably, you know,
the simplest thing

395
00:20:36,316 --> 00:20:39,417
I've had to deal with in months.

396
00:20:39,453 --> 00:20:41,453
But I am nervous.

397
00:20:46,126 --> 00:20:48,593
I had one.

398
00:20:51,932 --> 00:20:54,265
He was a drummer.

399
00:20:56,303 --> 00:20:59,003
And he said he couldn't
get it up with a condom.

400
00:21:01,007 --> 00:21:02,941
But--

401
00:21:02,976 --> 00:21:07,378
I--I remember the night before.

402
00:21:07,414 --> 00:21:10,415
It--I felt...

403
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:14,319
I felt lonely.

404
00:21:17,257 --> 00:21:19,023
Yeah.

405
00:21:19,059 --> 00:21:21,893
But you're not alone.

406
00:21:21,928 --> 00:21:23,928
I'm your best bitch, remember?

407
00:21:26,533 --> 00:21:28,233
Yeah.

408
00:21:28,268 --> 00:21:31,603
Okay, your turn.
Truth or dare.

409
00:21:31,638 --> 00:21:34,439
Truth.

410
00:21:34,474 --> 00:21:36,407
Do you still blame yourself?

411
00:21:36,443 --> 00:21:39,143
Shit. Okay.

412
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:40,545
Sorry, no.

413
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:43,515
I think I'm drunker
than I think I am.

414
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,316
Was that a sentence?

415
00:21:45,352 --> 00:21:48,419
No, I said truth.

416
00:21:48,455 --> 00:21:52,657
So do you know what happened?

417
00:21:52,692 --> 00:21:54,259
I mean, just what Alice told me.

418
00:21:54,294 --> 00:21:58,096
That you changed your face
for a professor

419
00:21:58,131 --> 00:22:01,466
and it got screwed up
and Charlie tried to save you.

420
00:22:01,501 --> 00:22:03,535
Yeah, that's the gist.

421
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:07,305
How is Alice?

422
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,440
Uh, Alice is dead.

423
00:22:20,554 --> 00:22:23,221
I don't blame myself.

424
00:22:23,256 --> 00:22:26,958
Except for when
I first wake up...

425
00:22:26,993 --> 00:22:28,593
and when I go to bed

426
00:22:28,628 --> 00:22:33,464
and all the time in between.

427
00:22:37,737 --> 00:22:39,737
Your turn.

428
00:22:42,275 --> 00:22:44,108
Dare.

429
00:22:44,144 --> 00:22:45,777
Dare.

430
00:22:47,113 --> 00:22:48,346
[laughs]

431
00:22:48,381 --> 00:22:49,547
[laughs]

432
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:51,149
My dare is to smoke weed?

433
00:22:51,184 --> 00:22:53,518
It's very middle school.

434
00:22:56,489 --> 00:22:58,723
Oh, oh.

435
00:22:58,758 --> 00:23:01,125
Do you know--

436
00:23:01,161 --> 00:23:02,660
do you know Weizenheim's Third?

437
00:23:02,696 --> 00:23:05,296
It's a tiny, little
weather suspension spell.

438
00:23:05,332 --> 00:23:07,432
- I thought you didn't--
- I don't.

439
00:23:07,467 --> 00:23:09,133
This doesn't count.

440
00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:10,401
Today's a cheat day.

441
00:23:10,437 --> 00:23:13,237
Right.

442
00:23:13,273 --> 00:23:16,708
Oh, the trick to this one
is that you enchant your lips.

443
00:23:28,722 --> 00:23:31,723
- And you're a smoke artiste.
- Mm. Okay.

444
00:23:31,758 --> 00:23:33,124
Your turn.

445
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:34,592
Don't, like, burn yourself.

446
00:23:34,628 --> 00:23:36,628
- Okay, how do you do it?
- Oh, um...

447
00:23:36,663 --> 00:23:38,062
Okay, let me.

448
00:23:57,183 --> 00:23:58,549
[laughs]

449
00:23:58,585 --> 00:24:00,551
- You're a fucking dork.
- [laughs]

450
00:24:00,587 --> 00:24:02,687
You're just jealous that
I'm such a quick study.

451
00:24:02,722 --> 00:24:05,690
- [clears throat]
- Yeah.

452
00:24:05,725 --> 00:24:07,725
Okay.

453
00:24:16,569 --> 00:24:18,269
What is that?

454
00:24:18,304 --> 00:24:20,171
[whispers] This one's
my favorite.

455
00:24:29,382 --> 00:24:31,215
That's my favorite, too.

456
00:24:35,522 --> 00:24:37,188
- Ooh!
- Come on in.

457
00:24:37,223 --> 00:24:39,590
Okay.

458
00:24:39,626 --> 00:24:42,160
[whistles]
Emily Greenstreet,

459
00:24:42,195 --> 00:24:44,629
living the loft life, huh?

460
00:24:44,664 --> 00:24:46,698
- Yeah.
- [laughs]

461
00:24:46,733 --> 00:24:48,166
Wine opener?

462
00:24:48,201 --> 00:24:50,334
One of those drawers.
One of the--

463
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:52,704
Wine opener.

464
00:24:52,739 --> 00:24:55,640
Ahh, wine opener, wine opener.

465
00:24:55,675 --> 00:24:58,409
Hey.

466
00:24:58,445 --> 00:25:02,613
I wanna do a spell.

467
00:25:02,649 --> 00:25:04,415
Why don't we keep drinking

468
00:25:04,451 --> 00:25:08,553
and make some really,
really bad decisions?

469
00:25:08,588 --> 00:25:11,289
That sounds, I don't know,
kind of fun.

470
00:25:11,324 --> 00:25:15,093
Yeah. You'll like it.

471
00:25:15,128 --> 00:25:18,329
- Mm.
- Come on.

472
00:25:18,364 --> 00:25:20,164
Cheat day.

473
00:25:22,023 --> 00:25:23,473
The defenestration of Prague.

474
00:25:23,528 --> 00:25:24,627
No, you already said that.

475
00:25:24,663 --> 00:25:26,396
- There were two.
- Mm.

476
00:25:26,431 --> 00:25:28,398
Look, any hope you had
of saving this guy

477
00:25:28,433 --> 00:25:29,832
is out the window.

478
00:25:29,868 --> 00:25:32,223
Like the guys in Prague.

479
00:25:34,439 --> 00:25:35,905
Shit.

480
00:25:35,941 --> 00:25:41,611
Eliot, we said we'd do
whatever actually works.

481
00:25:41,646 --> 00:25:44,781
Fine. We'll tell the council
in the morning.

482
00:25:44,816 --> 00:25:45,982
But I'll do it.

483
00:25:46,017 --> 00:25:48,685
The man's life
is my burden to bear.

484
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,788
Get over yourself, Ned Stark.

485
00:25:54,526 --> 00:25:56,326
Ned Stark.

486
00:26:07,706 --> 00:26:09,973
Do you even like magic?

487
00:26:10,008 --> 00:26:12,475
Yeah, like...

488
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:16,813
Like I like money or food
or any other useful shit.

489
00:26:16,848 --> 00:26:19,515
Money and food
don't explode in your face.

490
00:26:19,551 --> 00:26:23,286
You came to Brakebills
only to ease your suffering.

491
00:26:23,321 --> 00:26:26,756
The voices.
It was all chore and burden.

492
00:26:26,791 --> 00:26:29,659
But you saved yourself,
traveler.

493
00:26:29,694 --> 00:26:32,462
Good.

494
00:26:32,497 --> 00:26:34,964
Maybe you're simply done.

495
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,968
Now's your chance.
Walk away.

496
00:26:39,004 --> 00:26:42,772
Why? Chance at what?

497
00:26:42,807 --> 00:26:46,376
Few years of happy life.

498
00:26:46,411 --> 00:26:48,611
[laughs]

499
00:26:48,647 --> 00:26:53,716
There is bad surprise
in store for everyone.

500
00:26:53,752 --> 00:26:57,387
What surprise?

501
00:26:57,422 --> 00:27:01,891
Energy current
should be constant.

502
00:27:03,695 --> 00:27:08,564
But it's not.
Why?

503
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,800
There is something
happening to magic.

504
00:27:10,835 --> 00:27:13,336
The wellspring in Fillory.

505
00:27:13,371 --> 00:27:16,506
- The current is sputtering.
- And they're trying to fix it.

506
00:27:16,541 --> 00:27:18,808
Maybe it's going to disappear.

507
00:27:18,843 --> 00:27:21,477
- If that's the case...
- Shit could get real.

508
00:27:21,513 --> 00:27:25,615
If magic goes, it will be
very bad time to be Magician,

509
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:29,352
so consider the advantage
of getting out now.

510
00:27:29,387 --> 00:27:31,087
All right.
Okay, thank you.

511
00:27:31,122 --> 00:27:34,357
I'll meditate on it.
I...

512
00:27:34,392 --> 00:27:37,460
Right now, I'm staying.

513
00:27:37,495 --> 00:27:41,664
Then you're just fancy scarf
wrapped around an idiot.

514
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,133
You know what?
If it's so bad, you get out!

515
00:27:44,169 --> 00:27:46,936
You leave, I'll leave.

516
00:27:46,971 --> 00:27:50,139
I cannot leave.
Thanks for reminder.

517
00:27:50,175 --> 00:27:53,176
What--what,
you're trapped here?

518
00:27:53,211 --> 00:27:55,745
Remarkably like that.

519
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,847
Incorporate bond.

520
00:27:57,882 --> 00:27:59,916
Even I cannot break.

521
00:27:59,951 --> 00:28:01,818
Why?

522
00:28:01,853 --> 00:28:05,988
What did you do?

523
00:28:06,024 --> 00:28:08,791
I'm not drunk enough
to talk about it.

524
00:28:14,199 --> 00:28:18,601
Okay!

525
00:28:18,636 --> 00:28:20,703
I make love to many students.

526
00:28:20,739 --> 00:28:25,141
And then I fucked the wrong one.

527
00:28:25,176 --> 00:28:27,577
Oops.

528
00:28:27,612 --> 00:28:30,580
They sent you here?
God.

529
00:28:30,615 --> 00:28:32,115
It was that...

530
00:28:36,121 --> 00:28:39,088
Or give up magic.

531
00:28:39,124 --> 00:28:42,091
- Like you're telling me to.
- Yes.

532
00:28:42,127 --> 00:28:44,627
<i>I made my choice.</i>

533
00:28:59,878 --> 00:29:02,645
- [bang]
- Wakey, wakey.

534
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,815
You have 15 minutes
to save your life.

535
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:09,018
Tell me, if you were in charge,

536
00:29:09,053 --> 00:29:12,155
how would the FU Fighters
fix Fillory?

537
00:29:13,825 --> 00:29:16,526
It's an illusion spell.

538
00:29:16,561 --> 00:29:18,027
Party trick, really.
It'll only last

539
00:29:18,062 --> 00:29:20,963
as long as your skin's wet.

540
00:29:20,999 --> 00:29:22,498
You first.

541
00:29:22,534 --> 00:29:25,735
Yeah. You know, this is
the weirdest foreplay.

542
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:27,904
Oh, my God. Stop.

543
00:29:27,939 --> 00:29:30,239
Robe off!

544
00:29:30,275 --> 00:29:33,609
[laughs]

545
00:29:33,645 --> 00:29:36,512
Whoa, what is that?

546
00:29:36,548 --> 00:29:38,047
Oh, right, uh...

547
00:29:38,082 --> 00:29:39,582
You joined some kinda gang?

548
00:29:39,617 --> 00:29:41,517
Yes.

549
00:29:41,553 --> 00:29:42,885
Okay.

550
00:29:42,921 --> 00:29:45,621
Hop in.

551
00:29:45,657 --> 00:29:47,957
[laughs]

552
00:29:51,129 --> 00:29:54,130
[speaking Coptic]

553
00:30:10,615 --> 00:30:12,782
[Quentin's voice] Did it work?

554
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:20,723
Oh, shit.

555
00:30:20,758 --> 00:30:22,291
Don't judge me, please.

556
00:30:22,327 --> 00:30:26,162
I'm not. I'm just
putting it all together.

557
00:30:26,197 --> 00:30:29,065
You, Charlie.

558
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,834
That's why he's
at Brakebills South.

559
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,169
I mean, I had a lot of theories.

560
00:30:33,204 --> 00:30:35,238
Shh.

561
00:30:35,273 --> 00:30:37,807
You're ruining it.

562
00:30:37,842 --> 00:30:42,311
Just tell me what you think
when you look at me.

563
00:30:42,347 --> 00:30:45,848
And can you maybe try
a Russian accent?

564
00:30:56,794 --> 00:31:00,129
You didn't wanna...

565
00:31:00,164 --> 00:31:02,365
This is what I miss the most.

566
00:31:07,372 --> 00:31:10,840
So...

567
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:12,642
your turn.

568
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,921
[water running]

569
00:31:37,101 --> 00:31:40,202
It's her.

570
00:31:40,238 --> 00:31:41,938
[Emily's voice]
It's your memories.

571
00:31:45,276 --> 00:31:49,178
Well?
Anything you wanna say?

572
00:31:51,316 --> 00:31:54,283
I just really fucking miss you.

573
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:57,186
<i>[light music]</i>

574
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,527
[sighs]

575
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:48,999
What...
[knocking]

576
00:32:49,035 --> 00:32:53,270
- is that?
- Yeah.

577
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:55,739
Um, hey, I--
I've gotta get home.

578
00:32:55,775 --> 00:32:58,476
Um...

579
00:32:58,511 --> 00:33:00,411
I had a good time.

580
00:33:00,446 --> 00:33:02,913
You don't have to go.
We can do it again.

581
00:33:02,949 --> 00:33:04,515
You said yesterday
was cheat day.

582
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,383
You can't...

583
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:08,919
You can't cheat every day.

584
00:33:08,955 --> 00:33:11,655
I won't tell.

585
00:33:11,691 --> 00:33:15,359
[sighs] No, I don't want to.

586
00:33:15,394 --> 00:33:17,595
So, what, you're...
done with me?

587
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:20,297
I--I was helping you.

588
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:22,032
That's not what I said.

589
00:33:22,068 --> 00:33:25,002
Tell me, then.
What are you saying?

590
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,407
Last night was...

591
00:33:33,713 --> 00:33:35,946
It felt really good,
and it was...

592
00:33:38,351 --> 00:33:41,919
Probably exactly what I needed,
but I...

593
00:33:41,954 --> 00:33:46,790
It was also really weird and sad
and I feel awful.

594
00:33:46,826 --> 00:33:50,628
I feel worse than before.

595
00:33:50,663 --> 00:33:52,663
Apologies for my terrible life.

596
00:33:56,068 --> 00:33:58,669
I just don't wanna
use magic like that.

597
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:06,076
I'm sorry for
everything you lost.

598
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,983
I'll see you at work.

599
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:18,522
[door thuds closed]

600
00:34:20,993 --> 00:34:25,796
It is after much deliberation
that I have decided...

601
00:34:25,831 --> 00:34:27,765
we will not
execute the prisoner.

602
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,633
What?

603
00:34:29,669 --> 00:34:32,336
- Your Majesty, I'm--
- [whispering indistinctly]

604
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:33,938
It is in Fillory's
best interest.

605
00:34:33,973 --> 00:34:37,374
We agreed to have the prisoner
executed today.

606
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:40,077
We did.
But I changed my mind.

607
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:44,648
Well, I didn't.

608
00:34:44,684 --> 00:34:45,950
And I'm High Queen.

609
00:34:45,985 --> 00:34:47,885
The Queen may voice her opinion,

610
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,689
but ultimate judgment
belongs to the King.

611
00:34:51,724 --> 00:34:56,393
So this is what
the patriarchy smells like?

612
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:58,462
It's not the freshest.

613
00:35:00,733 --> 00:35:03,033
You are a king.
Act like it.

614
00:35:03,069 --> 00:35:06,036
I'm not just a king.

615
00:35:06,072 --> 00:35:07,805
Fen's pregnant.

616
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,741
[people murmuring]
I'm gonna be a father.

617
00:35:12,378 --> 00:35:15,446
Mm.

618
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:17,581
And I would like
to raise my child

619
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:22,753
in a world that does not just
kill its problems away.

620
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:27,391
We hear them and we
address them accordingly.

621
00:35:27,426 --> 00:35:29,593
That is fucking stupid.

622
00:35:29,629 --> 00:35:31,929
You wanna rule a kingdom?
Guess what.

623
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:35,799
People are gonna die
no matter what.

624
00:35:35,835 --> 00:35:38,502
Just trying to make sure
that it isn't you, okay?

625
00:35:47,146 --> 00:35:48,879
<i>Julia, I'll check you in.</i>

626
00:35:48,914 --> 00:35:50,648
<i>Dr. Higgins will be
ready shortly.</i>

627
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:54,051
Okay.
[sighs]

628
00:36:07,967 --> 00:36:09,800
I'm sorry, you're not in here.

629
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:11,001
Excuse me?

630
00:36:11,037 --> 00:36:13,070
You don't have an appointment.

631
00:36:13,105 --> 00:36:15,673
The doctor gave me one.
I mean, there must be a mistake.

632
00:36:15,708 --> 00:36:18,008
I'm sorry, but without an
appointment, I can't let you in.

633
00:36:18,044 --> 00:36:20,577
Look, it's Wicker.
Julia Wicker.

634
00:36:20,613 --> 00:36:22,112
You just said my name
two seconds ago.

635
00:36:22,148 --> 00:36:23,981
Can you just pick up the phone
and ask her?

636
00:36:28,654 --> 00:36:31,588
Doctor, there's a woman
claiming she's a patient.

637
00:36:31,624 --> 00:36:32,890
No, she doesn't.

638
00:36:32,925 --> 00:36:36,026
Uh, Julia Wicker.

639
00:36:36,062 --> 00:36:38,028
But, Doctor--

640
00:36:38,064 --> 00:36:40,964
Okay.

641
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,967
- You can go ahead.
- Yeah, thanks.

642
00:36:44,003 --> 00:36:46,770
I'll be right here.

643
00:36:57,708 --> 00:37:00,977
No geese!

644
00:37:01,012 --> 00:37:03,012
Oh.

645
00:37:03,047 --> 00:37:05,648
[groans]
Phew.

646
00:37:05,683 --> 00:37:08,084
You finish table.
Good work.

647
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:10,953
Yeah, so can we get to this?

648
00:37:10,989 --> 00:37:13,623
Enough "Karate Kid" bullshit.

649
00:37:13,658 --> 00:37:15,758
Not bullshit.

650
00:37:17,996 --> 00:37:20,596
Ask yourself a question:

651
00:37:20,632 --> 00:37:24,167
What will a Magician need
if dark days come?

652
00:37:24,202 --> 00:37:26,569
Answer: magic.

653
00:37:26,604 --> 00:37:28,004
But if it is gone,
it is gone, you say.

654
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:31,774
Not so, if you store it
like a battery.

655
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:33,976
That's what I am building.

656
00:37:41,853 --> 00:37:43,619
Those knots?

657
00:37:43,655 --> 00:37:46,155
Old class project,
tied with magic.

658
00:37:46,191 --> 00:37:50,193
That table, stained
through with magic.

659
00:37:50,228 --> 00:37:55,097
You release the energy,
I store it for rainy day.

660
00:37:55,133 --> 00:37:59,402
So my hands, are you
gonna teach me or what?

661
00:37:59,437 --> 00:38:02,605
You can travel to Fillory.

662
00:38:04,909 --> 00:38:07,076
It's the worst place
in the universe, yeah.

663
00:38:07,111 --> 00:38:10,646
You go there.
Get this.

664
00:38:10,682 --> 00:38:12,949
Moss. You need moss.

665
00:38:12,984 --> 00:38:15,651
It's amazing.
Can carry current.

666
00:38:15,687 --> 00:38:19,755
Do not care.

667
00:38:22,227 --> 00:38:24,927
I'll get it.

668
00:38:24,963 --> 00:38:26,796
[chuckles]

669
00:38:32,237 --> 00:38:34,503
Gods, it's good to see you.

670
00:38:34,539 --> 00:38:35,872
You asshole!

671
00:38:35,907 --> 00:38:37,673
You come here with no warning

672
00:38:37,709 --> 00:38:39,175
and try to kill my husband.

673
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:41,577
Of course I did.

674
00:38:41,613 --> 00:38:43,546
I thought you were waiting.

675
00:38:43,581 --> 00:38:45,548
I'm not a FU Fighter anymore.

676
00:38:45,583 --> 00:38:47,516
You always knew
that one day I'd have to--

677
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:51,053
Marry him, yes, and then
you'd be here, on the inside.

678
00:38:51,089 --> 00:38:55,524
You can't tell me that you don't
care about Fillory anymore.

679
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,260
I'm pregnant.

680
00:39:00,965 --> 00:39:03,165
- Then for the child.
- What?

681
00:39:03,201 --> 00:39:05,134
All I ask is you get us
information we need to--

682
00:39:05,169 --> 00:39:07,670
Bayler!

683
00:39:07,705 --> 00:39:10,072
Did I say "ask"?

684
00:39:10,108 --> 00:39:12,575
I meant help us.

685
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:15,511
Or I go to your king
and tell him exactly how well

686
00:39:15,546 --> 00:39:17,613
I know his wife.

687
00:39:17,649 --> 00:39:19,782
Then I'll tell him myself.

688
00:39:19,817 --> 00:39:23,219
Word travels fast
about the High King.

689
00:39:23,254 --> 00:39:25,221
Emotional.

690
00:39:25,256 --> 00:39:27,523
Easily wounded.

691
00:39:27,558 --> 00:39:30,026
Try it and see.

692
00:39:30,061 --> 00:39:32,795
Or help the cause.

693
00:39:36,634 --> 00:39:38,634
[knocks]

694
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,269
If the FU Fighters
make another move,

695
00:39:40,305 --> 00:39:42,305
I'll kill you myself.

696
00:39:50,148 --> 00:39:52,682
That should do it.

697
00:39:52,717 --> 00:39:54,617
How are you feeling?

698
00:39:54,652 --> 00:40:00,323
Like I finally understand why
people take these kind of drugs.

699
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:01,857
Okay, we'll start the procedure.

700
00:40:01,893 --> 00:40:02,959
You may feel some cramping,

701
00:40:02,994 --> 00:40:05,094
and that's perfectly normal.

702
00:40:17,976 --> 00:40:20,676
What--what's wrong?

703
00:40:20,712 --> 00:40:23,913
[sighs] Morning cobwebs.
Excuse me.

704
00:40:23,948 --> 00:40:27,283
- Just relax.
- Okay.

705
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,776
What are you doing?

706
00:40:58,983 --> 00:41:00,683
Wait.

707
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,886
Stop.

708
00:41:03,921 --> 00:41:07,223
[gasping]

709
00:41:07,258 --> 00:41:08,891
- Stop it! Wait!
- I can't.

710
00:41:08,926 --> 00:41:10,693
Stop!
What are you doing? No!

711
00:41:10,728 --> 00:41:11,694
[stabbing sound]
Kady!

712
00:41:11,729 --> 00:41:13,095
- Kady!
- [crying]

713
00:41:13,131 --> 00:41:14,764
- Kady!
- [gasping]

714
00:41:14,799 --> 00:41:18,000
- [gasping] I can't...
- Stop!

715
00:41:18,036 --> 00:41:21,404
[screaming]

716
00:41:27,845 --> 00:41:29,311
Oh, my God.

717
00:41:29,347 --> 00:41:32,782
Holy fuck.

718
00:41:32,817 --> 00:41:36,886
Oh, my--

719
00:41:36,921 --> 00:41:38,254
- Do it.
- What?

720
00:41:38,289 --> 00:41:39,955
