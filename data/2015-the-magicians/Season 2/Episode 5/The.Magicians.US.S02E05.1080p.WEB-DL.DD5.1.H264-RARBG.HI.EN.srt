180
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:32,671
- Until there's no spell left
and you're just...

181
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:37,175
You're left with...
- a big fucking problem.

182
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:43,915
Oh, shit.
I have a meeting in 15.

183
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,617
- Ooh.

184
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:47,919
[Light whooshing]

185
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,021
I'm sorry.
That was just reflex.

186
00:09:50,023 --> 00:09:53,091
Uh, that... i... um...

187
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:57,662
- Just... just put this
on the company card.

188
00:09:57,664 --> 00:09:59,197
They won't notice.

189
00:09:59,199 --> 00:10:01,700
- [Sighs]

190
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:03,268
<i>- I am happy.</i>

191
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,236
Yay, a baby.

192
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:08,139
- Eliot, what is this about?

193
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:12,944
I really wanna know.

194
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:17,282
- [Sighs]
My father was not the best...

195
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:18,984
- Wine, your majesty.

196
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:20,251
- Bad dad.

197
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:25,223
So I suppose I don't
exactly have the proper,

198
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:27,225
uh, uh...

199
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,860
Template to...

200
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:30,962
Ahh!
- [Screams]

201
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,964
- Quiet!

202
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,900
You are not welcome here,
child of earth.

203
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:39,137
- Eliot!

204
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,338
- [Groaning]

205
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,674
- [Grunting]

206
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:50,849
- Wait.

207
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:52,984
- This is not over,
child of earth.

208
00:10:57,289 --> 00:10:59,224
- Dungeon.

209
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,728
- What the hell
was that about?

210
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,998
- I tried expressing
my emotions.

211
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,167
Lesson learned.

212
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:17,375
- Shittiest security ever.

213
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:19,344
- So what are we
supposed to do?

214
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:22,047
Ship 'em back to loria?
- Actually, your highness,

215
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:23,882
he's not from loria.

216
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:25,417
- He's a native fillorian.

217
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:28,119
- My own people
are trying to kill me?

218
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:30,255
Hmm.
So French.

219
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:33,024
- They're commoners.
Not to worry.

220
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,427
- Oh, whoa, whoa.
I'm worried.

221
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:38,697
- I urge
a public execution, today.

222
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:41,299
- Might I suggest
strangulation?

223
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:42,767
For the symbolism.

224
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:44,235
- We don't wish
to fall to his level.

225
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:46,805
The bed of a thousand spikes
should do just fine.

226
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:51,076
- [Whispering indistinctly]

227
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:55,947
- Her slowness suggests tying
each of his limbs to a centaur,

228
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:58,750
and as they stretch him,
inch by inch,

229
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:03,788
a fifth centaur sets the spike,
if you will.

230
00:12:03,790 --> 00:24:07,578
- Jesus, no.

231
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:08,159
Everyone out. This is a matter
for the queen and me.

232
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,464
- That sloth is psychotic.

233
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:15,066
- It's all psychotic.
[Sighs]

234
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,435
Did you hear how tick
said "commoners"?

235
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:19,738
- When we're the least snobby
people in a room,

236
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,207
there's something wrong
with the room.

237
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:24,809
[Knocking]

238
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:30,982
- Yes?

239
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:33,785
- I wanted to apologize.

240
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:36,988
I'm sorry, um...

241
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,857
- Okay.

242
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,361
What?

243
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:49,200
- I just... i don't know
if you accepted my apology.

244
00:12:49,202 --> 00:12:52,370
- Yes.

245
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:55,140
- Okay.
- Actually, no.

246
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:57,509
No, I don't.

247
00:12:57,511 --> 00:13:00,378
We had just talked about
how terrible magic is,

248
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,981
and then you went and did it.

249
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:05,216
- It was just a tiny spell.

250
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:06,885
- There are a lot
of companies like this.

251
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:09,420
I'm sure fogg can find
another one for you.

252
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,091
[Sighs]

253
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:14,793
- Okay.

254
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:22,467
[Mouse clicking]

255
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:33,411
<i>- They're useless, right?</i>

256
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:37,515
- Well, maybe not useless.

257
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:43,021
You can still grab hold
of things, wave hello,

258
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:44,956
rub away a lonely night.

259
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,090
- Okay, but for magic?

260
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:47,992
- For magic? Useless.

261
00:13:50,296 --> 00:13:52,463
How was your travel?

262
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,465
- Fine.

263
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:57,569
Aim's good. I just can't
take people with me.

264
00:13:57,571 --> 00:13:59,571
- Some might
call that blessing.

265
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:02,073
- Yeah, well the option
would be nice, so...

266
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:04,175
I mean, can you help me?
What are we doing here?

267
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,010
- I can help you.

268
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:09,280
But first,
your end of deal.

269
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,392
Take out all the knots.

270
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:26,464
- What the hell?

271
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:31,002
- Ms. wicker.
- Uh, Julia.

272
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:34,038
- The test was positive.

273
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,608
If you'd like, we can
discuss your options.

274
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,077
- I want an abortion.
- Okay.

275
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:41,379
That's something that we can
perform here in office.

276
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:44,482
- Great. Uh, today?

277
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:46,284
- Unfortunately, we do have
a waiting list,

278
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:48,086
but it should just be
a couple of days.

279
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:50,989
- Days?

280
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:53,992
Doctor, I can't wait
a couple of days.

281
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:56,427
Please, i...

282
00:14:57,997 --> 00:15:03,268
- if I suspect abuse,
I'm obligated to report it.

283
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,169
Julia, you're safe here.

284
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:07,505
You can talk about
what happened.

285
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:12,176
No one is above the law.
- [Laughs]

286
00:15:12,178 --> 00:15:14,379
Ah, sorry.

287
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:18,216
I wish that were true.

288
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:20,952
Look, I just want this
to be over,

289
00:15:20,954 --> 00:15:24,222
and you can help me.

290
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:27,125
Please.

291
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:28,993
- Okay.

292
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:31,429
We'll set you up
for an ultrasound today.

293
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,699
Tomorrow, you can perform
the procedure.

294
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:37,135
We open at 8:00.

295
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:40,371
- Thank you.
- See you then.

298
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,553
- Leave.

299
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:58,256
- You don't get to say that.
- And why not?

300
00:15:58,258 --> 00:16:00,525
- Uh, because
you're in our castle.

301
00:16:00,527 --> 00:16:02,660
- Which is on my land.

302
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:05,463
- Uh, excuse me,
my manners.

303
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,265
I'm eliot,
high king of fillory.

304
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:12,337
- And I'm bayler, a proud
soldier of fillorians united.

305
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:14,572
A fu fighter.

306
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:17,308
- Did you say, "foo fighter"?
- Margo, behave.

307
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:21,079
- We will not rest until a
fillorian sits upon the throne.

308
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:23,481
- Okay, tell Ember.

309
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,716
He issued the decree.

310
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:27,652
- We will execute
every child of earth

311
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:31,322
that crosses into our land until
there are none left to kill.

312
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:34,392
- [Laughs]
- And yet, you laugh.

313
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:38,663
- I mean, a foo fighter?
- Margo.

314
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:42,734
If we execute him,
then he's a martyr.

315
00:16:42,736 --> 00:16:44,602
- Shit.

316
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:46,571
When was the last time
either of us dealt with

317
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:48,706
a political insurgency?

318
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:51,676
- Unless getting kicked out
of a fivesome counts.

319
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,244
First for me.
- Same.

320
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:56,014
I'm thinking we should
probably bone up.

321
00:16:56,016 --> 00:33:52,300
- Like, study?

322
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:59,450
- I'll grab what I can from
the brakebills library.

323
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:00,752
- [Groans] Fine.

324
00:17:00,754 --> 00:17:03,755
And grab some Adderall
while you're there.

325
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,733
- Okay, I'm done.

326
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:18,436
Oh, shit! What?
Do not... don't... please...

327
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:20,238
Don't sneak up on me
like that.

328
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,639
- This is my house.

329
00:17:21,641 --> 00:17:23,541
- Look, I finished untying
your bondage kit.

330
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,076
You gonna teach me now?

331
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:27,412
- You finish first step.

332
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:30,782
Next... The table.

333
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,186
- What about it?

334
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:37,321
- You make it sawdust.

335
00:17:37,323 --> 00:17:41,793
Do not worry.
I give you tool.

336
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:43,828
Enjoy.

- What are you
still doing here?

339
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:02,213
- I'm just finishing up.

340
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:03,548
- Gonna jerk it?

341
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,416
Break in the office?
- No.

342
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,551
What? No, I'm...

343
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:07,685
- it's the only place I can.

344
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:11,422
Wife and two kids?
No privacy at home.

345
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,459
- I'm not doing that...

346
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:15,560
Here.

347
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:17,795
- Just saying.
It's no judgment.

348
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:20,364
Adios.

349
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:22,166
[Door rattles closed]

350
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:27,738
- I owe you an apology
for being a bitch.

351
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,708
- Could you knock, please?

352
00:18:30,710 --> 00:37:01,418
[Knocks]

353
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:34,212
- What? Were you masturbating
in your office?

354
00:18:34,214 --> 00:18:35,546
- No!

355
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:37,582
- Whatever. I do.

356
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:39,517
- What is this place?

357
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:41,319
- [Sighs]

358
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:45,723
- I'm sorry, again,
about the spell, i...

359
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:49,460
- I'm sorry
for making you feel sorry.

360
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:54,298
It was just a stupid spell.

361
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,867
- Thank you.

362
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:57,401
- Want some?

363
00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:59,570
Vodka. Bit of lime.

364
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,377
You should stay.

365
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:07,545
Forget what I said earlier.

366
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:12,216
I think we'd be good friends.

367
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:14,352
- I would like that.

368
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:16,521
- What the hell are we
still doing in the office?

369
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:18,856
Right?
Let's get out of here.

370
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:20,324
- Mm.
- Finish that.

371
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:22,360
Come on.
- Okay.

372
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:24,162
- Yes!

373
00:19:24,164 --> 00:19:27,165
Torrent downloaded by RARBG

374
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,670
- Take a break.

375
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:36,374
No trick, no test.
I promise.

376
00:19:44,018 --> 00:19:44,917
That's it?

377
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:49,687
Take your balls out
of your purse and drink.

378
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:54,292
- No, if we're gonna talk
about what we did,

379
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:55,760
then we have to call it
what it is.

380
00:19:55,762 --> 00:19:57,528
It's stupid.
It's so fucking stupid.

381
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,931
It's the stupidest
I've ever fucking been.

382
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:01,933
- Reynard set us up.

383
00:20:01,935 --> 00:20:03,935
- Yeah, but I should have
known better.

384
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:07,872
You know, I knew the difference
between magic and miracles.

385
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:11,809
One is real and one is
a lie with sparkles.

386
00:20:11,811 --> 00:20:16,347
Like a nice female god was
gonna glide in and save...

387
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:19,483
It sounds so naive
to ever believe in that.

388
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:21,953
- Look, there is
one way through this,

389
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:25,389
and that is to find out
what happened 40 years ago.

390
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,291
- Yeah, and banish the fuck
out of Reynard.

391
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:30,828
- Yeah, so let's just get this
pesky abortion out of the way,

392
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,231
and that's next on the list.

393
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,700
- I know this is
a straightforward procedure.

394
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:38,703
It's probably, you know,
the simplest thing

395
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:41,839
I've had to deal with
in months.

396
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:44,242
But I am nervous.

397
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,349
- I had one.

398
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,854
He was a drummer.

399
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:01,692
And he said he couldn't
get it up with a condom.

400
00:21:03,495 --> 00:21:05,463
But...

401
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:10,001
I... i remember the night before.

402
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:13,004
It... i felt...

403
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,941
I felt lonely.

404
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:21,545
- Yeah.

405
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:24,282
- But you're not alone.

406
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:26,450
I'm your best bitch,
remember?

407
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,721
- Yeah.

408
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:34,358
- Okay, your turn.
Truth or dare.

409
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,861
- Truth.

410
00:21:36,863 --> 00:21:38,996
- Do you still
blame yourself?

411
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:41,632
- Shit. Okay.

412
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:42,933
- Sorry, no.

413
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:46,070
I think I'm drunker
than I think I am.

414
00:21:46,072 --> 00:21:47,772
Was that a sentence?

415
00:21:47,774 --> 00:21:50,841
- No, I said truth.

416
00:21:50,843 --> 00:21:55,046
So do you know what happened?

417
00:21:55,048 --> 00:21:56,714
- I mean, just what
Alice told me.

418
00:21:56,716 --> 00:22:00,418
That you changed your face
for a professor

419
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:03,921
and it got screwed up
and Charlie tried to save you.

420
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:06,357
- Yeah, that's the gist.

421
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:09,794
How is Alice?

422
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:12,063
- Uh, Alice is dead.

423
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:25,710
- I don't blame myself.

424
00:22:25,712 --> 00:22:29,513
Except for when
I first wake up...

425
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,015
And when I go to bed

426
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:36,053
and all the time
in between.

427
00:22:40,459 --> 00:22:42,493
Your turn.

428
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,597
- Dare.

429
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,499
- Dare.

430
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:50,801
[Laughs]

431
00:22:50,803 --> 00:22:51,969
- [Laughs]

432
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:53,637
My dare is to smoke weed?

433
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:56,073
It's very middle school.

434
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,512
- Oh, oh.

435
00:23:01,514 --> 00:23:03,681
Do you know...

436
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:05,116
Do you know
weizenheim's third?

437
00:23:05,118 --> 00:23:07,818
It's a tiny, little
weather suspension spell.

438
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,920
- I thought you didn't...
- I don't.

439
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:11,689
This doesn't count.

440
00:23:11,691 --> 00:23:13,057
Today's a cheat day.

441
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,593
- Right.

442
00:23:15,595 --> 00:23:19,463
- Oh, the trick to this one
is that you enchant your lips.

443
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:34,478
And you're a smoke artiste.
- Mm. Okay.

444
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,646
- Your turn.

445
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:37,014
Don't, like, burn yourself.

446
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:39,417
- Okay, how do you do it?
- Oh, um...

447
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:40,584
Okay, let me.

448
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:01,038
[Laughs]

449
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,040
You're a fucking dork.
- [Laughs]

450
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:05,509
You're just jealous that
I'm such a quick study.

451
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:08,512
[Clears throat]
- Yeah.

452
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:10,514
Okay.

453
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:20,791
- What is that?

454
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,860
- [Whispers] This one's
my favorite.

455
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,871
- That's my favorite, too.

456
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:39,710
Ooh!
- Come on in.

457
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:42,046
- Okay.

458
00:24:42,048 --> 00:24:44,682
[Whistles]
Emily greenstreet,

459
00:24:44,684 --> 00:24:47,084
living the loft life,
huh?

460
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:49,487
- Yeah.
- [Laughs]

461
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:50,554
Wine opener?

462
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:52,823
- One of those drawers.
One of the...

463
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,092
- wine opener.

464
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:58,229
Ahh, wine opener, wine opener.

465
00:24:58,231 --> 00:25:00,931
- Hey.

466
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:05,102
I wanna do a spell.

467
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:06,937
- Why don't we keep drinking

468
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:11,041
and make some really,
really bad decisions?

469
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:13,844
That sounds, I don't know,
kind of fun.

470
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:17,681
- Yeah. You'll like it.

471
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:20,851
- Mm.
- Come on.

472
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:22,920
Cheat day.

473
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:26,690
- The defenestration
. Of Prague.

474
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:27,791
- No, you already said that.

475
00:25:27,793 --> 00:25:29,226
- There were two.
- Mm.

476
00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:31,595
- Look, any hope you had
of saving this guy

477
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:32,930
is out the window.

478
00:25:32,932 --> 00:25:37,601
Like the guys in Prague.

479
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:39,003
- Shit.

480
00:25:39,005 --> 00:25:44,775
- Eliot, we said we'd do
whatever actually works.

481
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:47,912
- Fine. We'll tell the council
in the morning.

482
00:25:47,914 --> 00:25:49,079
But I'll do it.

483
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:51,815
The man's life
is my burden to bear.

484
00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:57,688
- Get over yourself,
ned stark.

485
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,323
Ned stark.

486
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:13,237
- Do you even like magic?

487
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:15,339
- Yeah, like...

488
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:19,977
Like I like money or food
or any other useful shit.

489
00:26:19,979 --> 00:26:22,580
- Money and food
don't explode in your face.

490
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:26,216
You came to brakebills
only to ease your suffering.

491
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:29,920
The voices.
It was all chore and burden.

492
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,990
But you saved yourself,
traveler.

493
00:26:32,992 --> 00:26:35,659
Good.

494
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:38,062
Maybe you're simply done.

495
00:26:38,064 --> 00:26:42,232
Now's your chance.
Walk away.

496
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:45,903
- Why? Chance at what?

497
00:26:45,905 --> 00:26:49,607
- Few years of happy life.

498
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:51,609
- [Laughs]

499
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:56,880
- There is bad surprise
in store for everyone.

500
00:26:56,882 --> 00:27:00,284
- What surprise?

501
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:05,222
- Energy current
should be constant.

502
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:11,762
- But it's not.
Why?

503
00:27:11,764 --> 00:27:13,964
- There is something
happening to magic.

504
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:16,266
- The wellspring in fillory.

505
00:27:16,268 --> 00:27:19,737
- The current is sputtering.
- And they're trying to fix it.

506
00:27:19,739 --> 00:27:21,972
- Maybe it's going
to disappear.

507
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:24,341
If that's the case...
- Shit could get real.

508
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:28,812
- If magic goes, it will be
very bad time to be magician,

509
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:32,416
so consider the advantage
of getting out now.

510
00:27:32,418 --> 00:27:34,351
- All right.
Okay, thank you.

511
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:37,421
I'll meditate on it.
I...

512
00:27:37,423 --> 00:27:40,324
Right now, I'm staying.

513
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:44,828
- Then you're just fancy scarf
wrapped around an idiot.

514
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,364
- You know what?
If it's so bad, you get out!

515
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:50,067
You leave, I'll leave.

516
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:53,203
- I cannot leave.
Thanks for reminder.

517
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:56,407
- What... what,
you're trapped here?

518
00:27:56,409 --> 00:27:58,909
- Remarkably like that.

519
00:27:58,911 --> 00:28:01,045
Incorporate bond.

520
00:28:01,047 --> 00:28:03,247
Even I cannot break.

521
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:05,182
- Why?

522
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:09,153
What did you do?

523
00:28:09,155 --> 00:28:12,156
- I'm not drunk enough
to talk about it.

524
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:21,832
Okay!

525
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:23,901
I make love to many students.

526
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:28,405
And then I fucked
the wrong one.

527
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:30,808
Oops.

528
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:33,811
- They sent you here?
God.

529
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:35,379
- It was that...

530
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:42,219
Or give up magic.

531
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:45,389
- Like you're telling me to.
- Yes.

532
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,991
<i>I made my choice.</i>

533
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:05,876
[Bang]
- Wakey, wakey.

534
00:29:05,878 --> 00:29:09,012
You have 15 minutes
