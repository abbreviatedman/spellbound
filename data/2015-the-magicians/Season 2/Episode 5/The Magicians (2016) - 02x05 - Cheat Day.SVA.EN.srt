1
00:00:00,713 --> 00:00:01,820
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,426
You may address me
as Reynard the Fox,

3
00:00:03,462 --> 00:00:06,527
trickster of the faithful,
the very stupid.

4
00:00:09,844 --> 00:00:11,350
You must be Marina.

5
00:00:13,074 --> 00:00:15,908
I need you to tell me
about the thing that killed you.

6
00:00:15,943 --> 00:00:18,844
There was a girl.

7
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:22,681
40 years ago, she vanished
Reynard from Earth.

8
00:00:22,717 --> 00:00:24,850
<i>Charlie, my brother,
he was really, really good.</i>

9
00:00:24,885 --> 00:00:26,619
<i>You know that spell I did
on the first day of class</i>

10
00:00:26,654 --> 00:00:28,120
<i>with the glass horse?
He taught me that.</i>

11
00:00:28,155 --> 00:00:31,490
I fell for this professor.
He was married.

12
00:00:31,525 --> 00:00:34,860
I thought I could
make him love me again

13
00:00:34,895 --> 00:00:37,196
if I could make myself prettier.

14
00:00:37,231 --> 00:00:39,832
<i>I really believed he might
actually be able</i>

15
00:00:39,867 --> 00:00:41,433
<i>to undo what I did.</i>

16
00:00:41,469 --> 00:00:44,536
It burned until he wasn't
there anymore.

17
00:00:44,572 --> 00:00:46,972
I gave up magic
and never looked back.

18
00:00:50,144 --> 00:00:52,144
No!

19
00:00:52,179 --> 00:00:53,712
<i>Alice is gone.</i>

20
00:00:53,748 --> 00:00:55,080
<i>There's a creature,</i>

21
00:00:55,116 --> 00:00:56,515
<i>she's called the White Lady.</i>

22
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:57,850
I want my hands back.

23
00:00:57,885 --> 00:01:00,052
No!

24
00:01:00,087 --> 00:01:02,554
Alice Quinn.
Bring her back to life.

25
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,756
I can't.

26
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:05,124
Is there nothing else
you desire?

27
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:06,159
Send me home.

28
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,967
I spoke with Professor Lipson

29
00:01:15,002 --> 00:01:16,769
about the tests she ran.

30
00:01:16,804 --> 00:01:19,071
But I'm sorry to say that

31
00:01:19,106 --> 00:01:20,706
we don't even know
where to start.

32
00:01:20,741 --> 00:01:22,608
Okay, is this a normal candle
or what--

33
00:01:27,715 --> 00:01:29,014
Of course.

34
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:30,616
You cure your own hands
just fine, but mine,

35
00:01:30,651 --> 00:01:32,017
you can't do
a fucking thing about, huh?

36
00:01:32,053 --> 00:01:36,922
Broken or not,
my hands are my hands.

37
00:01:36,957 --> 00:01:38,924
Yours are something else.

38
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:40,693
There's nothing we can do.

39
00:01:40,728 --> 00:01:42,494
And Brakebills
continues its tradition

40
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:43,796
of fucking my shit.

41
00:01:43,831 --> 00:01:45,898
There's nothing we can do here.

42
00:01:45,933 --> 00:01:48,834
There are other options.

43
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:52,638
One, I send you to someone
who may know more.

44
00:01:52,673 --> 00:01:53,806
Yes. Who is it?

45
00:01:53,841 --> 00:01:55,107
Professor Mayakovsky.

46
00:01:55,142 --> 00:01:56,875
The drunk perv in the igloo?

47
00:01:56,911 --> 00:01:58,210
Pass.

48
00:01:58,245 --> 00:01:59,745
What's option two?

49
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,481
Hmm, well,
you won't have to worry

50
00:02:02,516 --> 00:02:04,616
about your hands
or magic at all.

51
00:02:04,652 --> 00:02:06,552
It's actually where
I sent Quentin.

52
00:02:06,587 --> 00:02:08,520
Where's Quentin?

53
00:02:20,201 --> 00:02:22,634
So we finally get
to the cashier and guess what.

54
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:26,505
- Hmm?
- I left my wallet in the car.

55
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,141
- Oh, man.
- Talk about bad timing.

56
00:02:29,176 --> 00:02:31,276
Yeah.

57
00:02:31,312 --> 00:02:33,779
Hey, does Donut House,
does that taste like donuts?

58
00:02:33,814 --> 00:02:35,848
I just use that thing for soup.

59
00:02:35,883 --> 00:02:38,283
Soup?

60
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,319
What the fuck?

62
00:03:38,078 --> 00:03:41,747
Hello?

63
00:03:42,817 --> 00:03:44,917
Professor Mayakovsky?

64
00:03:52,126 --> 00:03:53,859
Shh--

65
00:03:53,894 --> 00:03:56,328
Hey! Hey, let me down!

66
00:03:56,363 --> 00:03:58,797
I'm a student!

67
00:04:02,002 --> 00:04:03,635
Dick.

00:04:06,907 --> 00:04:09,575
"Chicago Register."
July '76.

69
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,709
You know, dead or not,
Marina could have been

70
00:04:10,744 --> 00:04:12,177
a little more specific.

71
00:04:12,213 --> 00:04:15,013
I still don't know
what I'm looking for.

72
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:17,683
Look, banishing Reynard had to
take an insane amount of energy.

73
00:04:17,718 --> 00:04:21,820
So any sort of strange event
or operation.

74
00:04:21,856 --> 00:04:24,857
Yeah, that's literally
the definition of "news."

75
00:04:24,892 --> 00:04:26,658
We'll know it when we see it.

76
00:04:43,143 --> 00:04:45,043
I need some fuel.

77
00:04:54,321 --> 00:04:56,488
Okay.

78
00:05:01,028 --> 00:05:02,394
You okay?

79
00:05:08,969 --> 00:05:11,203
Is that the second time today?

80
00:05:11,238 --> 00:05:13,171
Third.

81
00:05:22,049 --> 00:05:23,815
Here.

82
00:05:23,851 --> 00:05:26,885
Oh, God, Jules, I--

83
00:05:26,921 --> 00:05:28,287
- Fuck!
- Hey.

84
00:05:28,322 --> 00:05:30,055
- Fuck.
- Hey, come on, come on.

85
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,190
- Hey, sit.
- Why?

86
00:05:32,226 --> 00:05:34,326
Why won't it just end?

87
00:05:34,361 --> 00:05:37,362
Why does it just keep getting
worse and worse?

88
00:05:37,398 --> 00:05:39,131
I'm so sorry.

89
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:41,199
Whatever's--
what's the spell

90
00:05:41,235 --> 00:05:43,101
to terminate it or whatever?

91
00:05:43,137 --> 00:05:44,836
I mean, there's stuff out
there, but it's all shady,

92
00:05:44,872 --> 00:05:48,040
Dark Ages shit from before
modern medicine.

93
00:05:48,075 --> 00:05:50,208
You don't cauterize a paper cut

94
00:05:50,244 --> 00:05:52,377
with a crazy,
medieval blowtorch.

95
00:05:52,413 --> 00:05:55,113
Sounds like exactly
what I wanna do.

96
00:05:55,149 --> 00:05:57,249
Not if it erases
your uterus and kidneys

97
00:05:57,284 --> 00:05:59,217
along with the fetus.

98
00:05:59,253 --> 00:06:00,919
Jesus.

99
00:06:00,955 --> 00:06:04,189
Hey, it's--it's okay.

100
00:06:04,224 --> 00:06:08,060
Jules, this is a simple,
totally mundane procedure.

101
00:06:08,095 --> 00:06:10,395
Is it? 'Cause it might not
be a simple,

102
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,230
totally mundane human embryo.

103
00:06:12,266 --> 00:06:14,433
I mean--

104
00:06:14,468 --> 00:06:18,203
I don't even know if it's
Reynard's or Richard's.

105
00:06:18,238 --> 00:06:23,075
Right now, it is just
a clump of cells.

106
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:26,745
Okay, so, let's just
put a pin in all this, okay?

107
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,780
We'll make an appointment.

108
00:06:36,523 --> 00:06:39,891
Your Majesty.
It's ready.

109
00:06:39,927 --> 00:06:43,261
At the very least, I hope you
solved the carbonation issue.

110
00:06:43,297 --> 00:06:47,532
We had to dump that last glass
in another world, you know.

111
00:06:47,568 --> 00:06:49,501
Still bubbling.

112
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:57,509
Oh, the miles we must walk.

113
00:06:57,544 --> 00:07:00,712
My King.
I have the best news.

114
00:07:00,748 --> 00:07:03,181
If that rabbit
was a prosecco, I'd agree.

115
00:07:03,217 --> 00:07:05,450
This isn't just a rabbit.

116
00:07:05,486 --> 00:07:08,186
- Pregnant.
- Jesus.

117
00:07:08,222 --> 00:07:10,022
We're going to be parents.

118
00:07:10,057 --> 00:07:12,357
That rabbit knows if you're--

119
00:07:12,393 --> 00:07:14,793
- Pregnant.
- Okay, okay.

120
00:07:17,798 --> 00:07:19,531
- You're not smiling.
- I'm sorry.

121
00:07:19,566 --> 00:07:21,266
- It's just--you see--
- Pregnant.

122
00:07:21,301 --> 00:07:24,036
Okay, rabbit! Chill.

123
00:07:26,807 --> 00:07:28,473
Ah, ah! Where do you think
you're going?

124
00:07:28,509 --> 00:07:30,809
It may suck all the moisture
from my tongue,

125
00:07:30,844 --> 00:07:34,346
but damned if I'm not going
to toast to this shit.

126
00:07:34,381 --> 00:07:38,183
To our violently attractive
progeny.

127
00:07:48,462 --> 00:07:50,495
Hey, yo!
Yo, let me down, okay?

128
00:07:50,531 --> 00:07:54,132
What the fuck is this shit?

129
00:07:54,168 --> 00:07:55,934
What do you want?

130
00:07:55,969 --> 00:07:58,370
My hands can't
cast spells anymore.

131
00:07:58,405 --> 00:08:02,941
This is not Mayakovsy's Home
for Magically Inert.

132
00:08:02,976 --> 00:08:07,212
But maybe an exchange.

133
00:08:07,247 --> 00:08:08,880
What do you got in mind?

134
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,982
I'm in the middle of project.

135
00:08:11,018 --> 00:08:14,186
Help me, I do what I can.

136
00:08:17,091 --> 00:08:19,157
- I'm in.
- Okay.

137
00:08:27,301 --> 00:08:29,101
Is everybody out here
really so lifeless?

138
00:08:29,136 --> 00:08:32,938
Yes. We are, we are.
That's why we drink.

139
00:08:32,973 --> 00:08:34,439
Well, I drink just fine
as a Magician.

140
00:08:34,475 --> 00:08:36,608
Yeah, because your world
was so overwhelming and scary

141
00:08:36,643 --> 00:08:38,143
and you needed a break
from it all.

142
00:08:38,178 --> 00:08:39,344
Now you're gonna drink

143
00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:40,846
because each day
is so goddamn dull

144
00:08:40,881 --> 00:08:44,116
and that takes a lot more booze.

145
00:08:44,151 --> 00:08:45,417
You ever cast anymore?

146
00:08:45,452 --> 00:08:46,651
God, no.

147
00:08:46,687 --> 00:08:48,153
Sorry, that was stupid.

148
00:08:48,188 --> 00:08:50,222
No, it's okay.

149
00:08:50,257 --> 00:08:51,523
I mean, nobody ever
gives up magic

150
00:08:51,558 --> 00:08:54,926
because everything's peachy.

151
00:08:54,962 --> 00:08:56,695
You wanna tell me?

152
00:09:03,036 --> 00:09:04,436
- Uh--
- I'm sorry.

153
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:06,972
No. I shouldn't have asked.

154
00:09:07,007 --> 00:09:09,941
I can see that it's recent.

155
00:09:09,977 --> 00:09:13,011
It's fucking madness.

156
00:09:13,046 --> 00:09:15,881
Teaching that stuff to kids.
I mean...kids.

157
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,516
It's like, what's the point?
You know?

158
00:09:17,551 --> 00:09:19,451
'Cause it feels like for every
one thing that we fix,

159
00:09:19,486 --> 00:09:22,220
five shitty things
spring up in its place.

160
00:09:22,256 --> 00:09:24,523
Because each spell
is just another complication.

161
00:09:24,558 --> 00:09:26,358
That we cast
another spell to fix.

162
00:09:26,393 --> 00:09:28,426
Repeat, repeat, repeat.

163
00:09:28,462 --> 00:09:32,330
Until there's no spell left
and you're just--

164
00:09:32,366 --> 00:09:36,968
- you're left with--
- A big fucking problem.

165
00:09:39,606 --> 00:09:43,408
Oh, shit.
I have a meeting in 15.

166
00:09:43,443 --> 00:09:45,243
Ooh.

167
00:09:47,648 --> 00:09:49,514
I'm sorry.
That was just reflex.

168
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:53,084
Uh, that--I--um...

169
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,355
Just--just put this
on the company card.

170
00:09:57,391 --> 00:09:58,990
They won't notice.

171
00:10:01,428 --> 00:10:03,094
<i>I am happy.</i>

172
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,063
Yay, a baby.

173
00:10:05,098 --> 00:10:07,732
Eliot, what is this about?

174
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,704
I really wanna know.

175
00:10:12,739 --> 00:10:17,108
My father was not the best...

176
00:10:17,144 --> 00:10:18,543
Wine, Your Majesty.

177
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:20,278
Bad dad.

178
00:10:20,314 --> 00:10:25,050
So I suppose I don't
exactly have the proper,

179
00:10:25,085 --> 00:10:27,052
uh, uh...

180
00:10:27,087 --> 00:10:28,620
template to--

181
00:10:28,655 --> 00:10:30,522
Ahh!

182
00:10:30,557 --> 00:10:32,757
Quiet!

183
00:10:32,793 --> 00:10:35,460
You are not welcome here,
child of Earth.

184
00:10:37,664 --> 00:10:38,763
Eliot!

185
00:10:48,108 --> 00:10:50,609
Wait.

186
00:10:50,644 --> 00:10:52,577
This is not over,
child of Earth.

187
00:10:57,184 --> 00:10:59,084
Dungeon.

188
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,421
What the hell was that about?

189
00:11:03,457 --> 00:11:06,558
I tried expressing my emotions.

190
00:11:06,593 --> 00:11:08,693
Lesson learned.

191
00:11:12,394 --> 00:11:16,864
Shittiest security ever.

192
00:11:17,382 --> 00:11:19,316
So what are we supposed to do?

193
00:11:19,351 --> 00:11:21,952
- Ship 'em back to Loria?
- Actually, Your Highness,

194
00:11:21,987 --> 00:11:23,720
he's not from Loria.

195
00:11:23,756 --> 00:11:25,422
He's a native Fillorian.

196
00:11:25,457 --> 00:11:28,024
My own people
are trying to kill me?

197
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,160
Hmm.
So French.

198
00:11:30,195 --> 00:11:32,929
They're commoners.
Not to worry.

199
00:11:32,965 --> 00:11:35,432
Oh, whoa, whoa.
I'm worried.

200
00:11:35,467 --> 00:11:38,735
I urge
a public execution, today.

201
00:11:38,771 --> 00:11:41,271
Might I suggest strangulation?

202
00:11:41,306 --> 00:11:42,839
For the symbolism.

203
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,207
We don't wish
to fall to his level.

204
00:11:44,243 --> 00:11:46,476
The Bed of a Thousand Spikes
should do just fine.

205
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:55,852
Her Slowness suggests tying
each of his limbs to a centaur,

206
00:11:55,888 --> 00:11:58,789
and as they stretch him,
inch by inch,

207
00:11:58,824 --> 00:12:03,360
a fifth centaur sets the spike,
if you will.

208
00:12:03,395 --> 00:12:05,028
Jesus, no.

209
00:12:05,063 --> 00:12:07,898
Everyone out. This is a matter
for the Queen and me.

210
00:12:09,401 --> 00:12:12,435
That sloth is psychotic.

211
00:12:12,471 --> 00:12:14,971
It's all psychotic.

212
00:12:15,007 --> 00:12:17,407
Did you hear how Tick
said "commoners"?

213
00:12:17,442 --> 00:12:19,743
When we're the least snobby
people in a room,

214
00:12:19,778 --> 00:12:22,112
there's something wrong
with the room.

215
00:12:29,288 --> 00:12:30,854
Yes?

216
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:33,356
I wanted to apologize.

217
00:12:33,392 --> 00:12:36,860
I'm sorry, um...

218
00:12:36,895 --> 00:12:38,495
Okay.

219
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,333
What?

220
00:12:43,368 --> 00:12:49,139
I just--I don't know
if you accepted my apology.

221
00:12:49,174 --> 00:12:52,375
Yes.

222
00:12:52,411 --> 00:12:55,078
- Okay.
- Actually, no.

223
00:12:55,113 --> 00:12:57,514
No, I don't.

224
00:12:57,549 --> 00:13:00,317
We had just talked about
how terrible magic is,

225
00:13:00,352 --> 00:13:02,786
and then you went and did it.

226
00:13:02,821 --> 00:13:05,088
It was just a tiny spell.

227
00:13:05,123 --> 00:13:06,890
There are a lot
of companies like this.

228
00:13:06,925 --> 00:13:09,159
I'm sure Fogg can find
another one for you.

229
00:13:12,998 --> 00:13:14,397
Okay.

230
00:13:31,984 --> 00:13:33,350
<i>They're useless, right?</i>

231
00:13:33,385 --> 00:13:37,320
Well, maybe not useless.

232
00:13:40,058 --> 00:13:42,893
You can still grab hold
of things, wave hello,

233
00:13:42,928 --> 00:13:44,594
rub away a lonely night.

234
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,996
Okay, but for magic?

235
00:13:46,031 --> 00:13:47,898
For magic? Useless.

236
00:13:50,302 --> 00:13:52,269
How was your travel?

237
00:13:52,304 --> 00:13:54,437
Fine.

238
00:13:54,473 --> 00:13:57,607
Aim's good. I just can't
take people with me.

239
00:13:57,643 --> 00:13:59,576
Some might call that blessing.

240
00:13:59,611 --> 00:14:02,112
Yeah, well the option
would be nice, so--

241
00:14:02,147 --> 00:14:04,047
I mean, can you help me?
What are we doing here?

242
00:14:04,082 --> 00:14:05,815
I can help you.

243
00:14:05,851 --> 00:14:08,952
But first, your end of deal.

244
00:14:18,997 --> 00:14:21,097
Take out all the knots.

245
00:14:23,402 --> 00:14:26,436
What the hell?

246
00:14:26,471 --> 00:14:30,640
- Ms. Wicker.
- Uh, Julia.

247
00:14:30,676 --> 00:14:34,077
The test was positive.

248
00:14:34,112 --> 00:14:36,613
If you'd like, we can
discuss your options.

249
00:14:36,648 --> 00:14:39,149
- I want an abortion.
- Okay.

250
00:14:39,184 --> 00:14:41,318
That's something that we can
perform here in office.

251
00:14:41,353 --> 00:14:44,421
Great. Uh, today?

252
00:14:44,456 --> 00:14:46,189
Unfortunately, we do have
a waiting list,

253
00:14:46,224 --> 00:14:47,924
but it should just be
a couple of days.

254
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,027
Days?

255
00:14:51,063 --> 00:14:53,663
Doctor, I can't wait
a couple of days.

256
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:56,166
Please, I--

257
00:14:58,103 --> 00:15:03,139
If I suspect abuse,
I'm obligated to report it.

258
00:15:03,175 --> 00:15:05,008
Julia, you're safe here.

259
00:15:05,043 --> 00:15:07,410
You can talk about
what happened.

260
00:15:07,446 --> 00:15:12,015
No one is above the law.

261
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,284
Ah, sorry.

262
00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:18,054
I wish that were true.

263
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:20,523
Look, I just want this
to be over,

264
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:24,027
and you can help me.

265
00:15:24,062 --> 00:15:26,963
Please.

266
00:15:26,999 --> 00:15:29,032
Okay.

267
00:15:29,067 --> 00:15:31,368
We'll set you up
for an ultrasound today.

268
00:15:31,403 --> 00:15:34,504
Tomorrow, you can perform
the procedure.

269
00:15:34,539 --> 00:15:36,973
We open at 8:00.

270
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:40,110
- Thank you.
- See you then.

271
00:15:51,263 --> 00:15:52,196
Hi.

272
00:15:52,232 --> 00:15:53,631
Leave.

273
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:56,234
- You don't get to say that.
- And why not?

274
00:15:56,269 --> 00:15:58,536
Uh, because
you're in our castle.

275
00:15:58,571 --> 00:16:00,705
Which is on my land.

276
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,474
Uh, excuse me, my manners.

277
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,410
I'm Eliot, High King of Fillory.

278
00:16:05,445 --> 00:16:10,314
And I'm Bayler, a proud
soldier of Fillorians United.

279
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,583
A FU fighter.

280
00:16:12,619 --> 00:16:15,453
- Did you say, "Foo Fighter"?
- Margo, behave.

281
00:16:15,488 --> 00:16:18,790
We will not rest until a
Fillorian sits upon the throne.

282
00:16:18,825 --> 00:16:21,492
Okay, tell Ember.

283
00:16:21,528 --> 00:16:22,760
He issued the decree.

284
00:16:22,796 --> 00:16:25,697
We will execute
every child of Earth

285
00:16:25,732 --> 00:16:29,267
that crosses into our land until
there are none left to kill.

286
00:16:29,302 --> 00:16:32,170
And yet, you laugh.

287
00:16:34,407 --> 00:16:36,741
- I mean, a Foo Fighter?
- Margo.

288
00:16:36,776 --> 00:16:40,611
If we execute him,
then he's a martyr.

289
00:16:40,647 --> 00:16:42,647
Shit.

290
00:16:42,682 --> 00:16:44,615
When was the last time
either of us dealt with

291
00:16:44,651 --> 00:16:46,784
a political insurgency?

292
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,754
Unless getting kicked out
of a fivesome counts.

293
00:16:49,789 --> 00:16:51,422
- First for me.
- Same.

294
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:53,725
I'm thinking we should
probably bone up.

295
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,526
Like, study?

296
00:16:55,562 --> 00:16:57,462
I'll grab what I can from
the Brakebills Library.

297
00:16:57,497 --> 00:16:58,763
Fine.

298
00:16:58,798 --> 00:17:01,599
And grab some Adderall
while you're there.

299
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:13,778
Okay, I'm done.

300
00:17:13,813 --> 00:17:16,414
Oh, shit! What?
Do not--don't--please--

301
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:18,149
don't sneak up on me like that.

302
00:17:18,184 --> 00:17:19,684
This is my house.

303
00:17:19,719 --> 00:17:21,552
Look, I finished untying
your bondage kit.

304
00:17:21,588 --> 00:17:22,754
You gonna teach me now?

305
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:25,389
You finish first step.

306
00:17:25,425 --> 00:17:28,659
Next...the table.

307
00:17:31,397 --> 00:17:32,897
What about it?

308
00:17:32,932 --> 00:17:35,266
You make it sawdust.

309
00:17:35,301 --> 00:17:39,670
Do not worry.
I give you tool.

310
00:17:39,706 --> 00:17:41,739
Enjoy.

311
00:17:54,954 --> 00:17:57,955
What are you still doing here?

312
00:17:57,991 --> 00:17:59,891
I'm just finishing up.

313
00:17:59,926 --> 00:18:01,492
Gonna jerk it?

314
00:18:01,528 --> 00:18:03,361
- Break in the office?
- No.

315
00:18:03,396 --> 00:18:04,495
What? No, I'm--

316
00:18:04,531 --> 00:18:05,663
It's the only place I can.

317
00:18:05,698 --> 00:18:09,367
Wife and two kids?
No privacy at home.

318
00:18:09,402 --> 00:18:12,436
I'm not doing that...

319
00:18:12,472 --> 00:18:13,571
here.

320
00:18:13,606 --> 00:18:15,640
Just saying.
It's no judgment.

321
00:18:15,675 --> 00:18:18,309
Adios.

322
00:18:22,315 --> 00:18:25,783
I owe you an apology
for being a bitch.

323
00:18:25,819 --> 00:18:28,519
Could you knock, please?

324
00:18:29,956 --> 00:18:31,923
What? Were you masturbating
in your office?

325
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:33,524
No!

326
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,593
Whatever. I do.

327
00:18:35,628 --> 00:18:37,461
What is this place?

328
00:18:41,835 --> 00:18:43,734
I'm sorry, again,
about the spell, I--

329
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:47,438
I'm sorry
for making you feel sorry.

330
00:18:47,473 --> 00:18:52,243
It was just a stupid spell.

331
00:18:52,278 --> 00:18:53,744
Thank you.

332
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,379
Want some?

333
00:18:55,415 --> 00:18:57,415
Vodka. Bit of lime.

334
00:19:02,455 --> 00:19:04,288
You should stay.

335
00:19:04,324 --> 00:19:05,489
Forget what I said earlier.

336
00:19:05,525 --> 00:19:09,861
I think we'd be good friends.

337
00:19:09,896 --> 00:19:12,396
I would like that.

338
00:19:12,432 --> 00:19:14,465
What the hell are we
still doing in the office?

339
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,868
Right?
Let's get out of here.

340
00:19:16,903 --> 00:19:18,236
- Mm.
- Finish that.

341
00:19:18,271 --> 00:19:20,304
- Come on.
- Okay.

342
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,839
Yes!

343
00:19:28,715 --> 00:19:30,448
Take a break.

344
00:19:31,951 --> 00:19:34,318
No trick, no test.
I promise.

345
00:19:42,795 --> 00:19:44,328
That's it?

346
00:19:44,364 --> 00:19:47,498
Take your balls out
of your purse and drink.

347
00:19:50,403 --> 00:19:52,436
No, if we're gonna talk
about what we did,

348
00:19:52,472 --> 00:19:53,804
then we have to call it
what it is.

349
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,740
It's stupid.
It's so fucking stupid.

350
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,842
It's the stupidest
I've ever fucking been.

351
00:19:57,877 --> 00:20:00,044
Reynard set us up.

352
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:02,046
Yeah, but I should have
known better.

353
00:20:02,081 --> 00:20:05,950
You know, I knew the difference
between magic and miracles.

354
00:20:05,985 --> 00:20:09,854
One is real and one is
a lie with sparkles.

355
00:20:09,889 --> 00:20:14,492
Like a nice female god was
gonna glide in and save--

356
00:20:14,527 --> 00:20:17,461
It sounds so naive
to ever believe in that.

357
00:20:17,497 --> 00:20:20,031
Look, there is
one way through this,

358
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:23,534
and that is to find out
what happened 40 years ago.

359
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:25,469
Yeah, and banish the fuck
out of Reynard.

360
00:20:25,505 --> 00:20:28,940
Yeah, so let's just get this
pesky abortion out of the way,

361
00:20:28,975 --> 00:20:31,375
and that's next on the list.

362
00:20:31,411 --> 00:20:33,744
I know this is
a straightforward procedure.

363
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,781
It's probably, you know,
the simplest thing

364
00:20:36,816 --> 00:20:39,917
I've had to deal with in months.

365
00:20:39,953 --> 00:20:41,953
But I am nervous.

366
00:20:46,626 --> 00:20:49,093
I had one.

367
00:20:52,432 --> 00:20:54,765
He was a drummer.

368
00:20:56,803 --> 00:20:59,503
And he said he couldn't
get it up with a condom.

369
00:21:01,507 --> 00:21:03,441
But--

370
00:21:03,476 --> 00:21:07,878
I--I remember the night before.

371
00:21:07,914 --> 00:21:10,915
It--I felt...

372
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:14,819
I felt lonely.

373
00:21:17,757 --> 00:21:19,523
Yeah.

374
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:22,393
But you're not alone.

375
00:21:22,428 --> 00:21:24,428
I'm your best bitch, remember?

376
00:21:27,033 --> 00:21:28,733
Yeah.

377
00:21:28,768 --> 00:21:32,103
Okay, your turn.
Truth or dare.

378
00:21:32,138 --> 00:21:34,939
Truth.

379
00:21:34,974 --> 00:21:36,907
Do you still blame yourself?

380
00:21:36,943 --> 00:21:39,643
Shit. Okay.

381
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,045
Sorry, no.

382
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:44,015
I think I'm drunker
than I think I am.

383
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,816
Was that a sentence?

384
00:21:45,852 --> 00:21:48,919
No, I said truth.

385
00:21:48,955 --> 00:21:53,157
So do you know what happened?

386
00:21:53,192 --> 00:21:54,759
I mean, just what Alice told me.

387
00:21:54,794 --> 00:21:58,596
That you changed your face
for a professor

388
00:21:58,631 --> 00:22:01,966
and it got screwed up
and Charlie tried to save you.

389
00:22:02,001 --> 00:22:04,035
Yeah, that's the gist.

390
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:07,805
How is Alice?

391
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,940
Uh, Alice is dead.

392
00:22:21,054 --> 00:22:23,721
I don't blame myself.

393
00:22:23,756 --> 00:22:27,458
Except for when
I first wake up...

394
00:22:27,493 --> 00:22:29,093
and when I go to bed

395
00:22:29,128 --> 00:22:33,964
and all the time in between.

396
00:22:38,237 --> 00:22:40,237
Your turn.

397
00:22:42,775 --> 00:22:44,608
Dare.

398
00:22:44,644 --> 00:22:46,277
Dare.

399
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:51,649
My dare is to smoke weed?

400
00:22:51,684 --> 00:22:54,018
It's very middle school.

401
00:22:56,989 --> 00:22:59,223
Oh, oh.

402
00:22:59,258 --> 00:23:01,625
Do you know--

403
00:23:01,661 --> 00:23:03,160
do you know Weizenheim's Third?

404
00:23:03,196 --> 00:23:05,796
It's a tiny, little
weather suspension spell.

405
00:23:05,832 --> 00:23:07,932
- I thought you didn't--
- I don't.

406
00:23:07,967 --> 00:23:09,633
This doesn't count.

407
00:23:09,669 --> 00:23:10,901
Today's a cheat day.

408
00:23:10,937 --> 00:23:13,737
Right.

409
00:23:13,773 --> 00:23:17,208
Oh, the trick to this one
is that you enchant your lips.

410
00:23:29,222 --> 00:23:32,223
- And you're a smoke artiste.
- Mm. Okay.

411
00:23:32,258 --> 00:23:33,624
Your turn.

412
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:35,092
Don't, like, burn yourself.

413
00:23:35,128 --> 00:23:37,128
- Okay, how do you do it?
- Oh, um...

414
00:23:37,163 --> 00:23:38,562
Okay, let me.

415
00:23:59,085 --> 00:24:01,051
You're a fucking dork.

416
00:24:01,087 --> 00:24:03,187
You're just jealous that
I'm such a quick study.

417
00:24:03,222 --> 00:24:06,190
Yeah.

418
00:24:06,225 --> 00:24:08,225
Okay.

419
00:24:17,069 --> 00:24:18,769
What is that?

420
00:24:18,804 --> 00:24:20,671
This one's
my favorite.

421
00:24:29,882 --> 00:24:31,715
That's my favorite, too.

422
00:24:36,022 --> 00:24:37,688
- Ooh!
- Come on in.

423
00:24:37,723 --> 00:24:40,090
Okay.

424
00:24:40,126 --> 00:24:42,660
Emily Greenstreet,

425
00:24:42,695 --> 00:24:45,129
living the loft life, huh?

426
00:24:45,164 --> 00:24:47,198
Yeah.

427
00:24:47,233 --> 00:24:48,666
Wine opener?

428
00:24:48,701 --> 00:24:50,834
One of those drawers.
One of the--

429
00:24:50,870 --> 00:24:53,204
Wine opener.

430
00:24:53,239 --> 00:24:56,140
Ahh, wine opener, wine opener.

431
00:24:56,175 --> 00:24:58,909
Hey.

432
00:24:58,945 --> 00:25:03,113
I wanna do a spell.

433
00:25:03,149 --> 00:25:04,915
Why don't we keep drinking

434
00:25:04,951 --> 00:25:09,053
and make some really,
really bad decisions?

435
00:25:09,088 --> 00:25:11,789
That sounds, I don't know,
kind of fun.

436
00:25:11,824 --> 00:25:15,593
Yeah. You'll like it.

437
00:25:15,628 --> 00:25:18,829
- Mm.
- Come on.

438
00:25:18,864 --> 00:25:20,664
Cheat day.

439
00:25:22,523 --> 00:25:23,973
The defenestration of Prague.

440
00:25:24,028 --> 00:25:25,127
No, you already said that.

441
00:25:25,163 --> 00:25:26,896
- There were two.
- Mm.

442
00:25:26,931 --> 00:25:28,898
Look, any hope you had
of saving this guy

443
00:25:28,933 --> 00:25:30,332
is out the window.

444
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:32,723
Like the guys in Prague.

445
00:25:34,939 --> 00:25:36,405
Shit.

446
00:25:36,441 --> 00:25:42,111
Eliot, we said we'd do
whatever actually works.

447
00:25:42,146 --> 00:25:45,281
Fine. We'll tell the council
in the morning.

448
00:25:45,316 --> 00:25:46,482
But I'll do it.

449
00:25:46,517 --> 00:25:49,185
The man's life
is my burden to bear.

450
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:53,288
Get over yourself, Ned Stark.

451
00:25:55,026 --> 00:25:56,826
Ned Stark.

452
00:26:08,206 --> 00:26:10,473
Do you even like magic?

453
00:26:10,508 --> 00:26:12,975
Yeah, like...

454
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:17,313
Like I like money or food
or any other useful shit.

455
00:26:17,348 --> 00:26:20,015
Money and food
don't explode in your face.

456
00:26:20,051 --> 00:26:23,786
You came to Brakebills
only to ease your suffering.

457
00:26:23,821 --> 00:26:27,256
The voices.
It was all chore and burden.

458
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:30,159
But you saved yourself,
traveler.

459
00:26:30,194 --> 00:26:32,962
Good.

460
00:26:32,997 --> 00:26:35,464
Maybe you're simply done.

461
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:39,468
Now's your chance.
Walk away.

462
00:26:39,504 --> 00:26:43,272
Why? Chance at what?

463
00:26:43,307 --> 00:26:46,876
Few years of happy life.

464
00:26:49,147 --> 00:26:54,216
There is bad surprise
in store for everyone.

465
00:26:54,252 --> 00:26:57,887
What surprise?

466
00:26:57,922 --> 00:27:02,391
Energy current
should be constant.

467
00:27:04,195 --> 00:27:09,064
But it's not.
Why?

468
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,300
There is something
happening to magic.

469
00:27:11,335 --> 00:27:13,836
The wellspring in Fillory.

470
00:27:13,871 --> 00:27:17,006
- The current is sputtering.
- And they're trying to fix it.

471
00:27:17,041 --> 00:27:19,308
Maybe it's going to disappear.

472
00:27:19,343 --> 00:27:21,977
- If that's the case...
- Shit could get real.

473
00:27:22,013 --> 00:27:26,115
If magic goes, it will be
very bad time to be Magician,

474
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:29,852
so consider the advantage
of getting out now.

475
00:27:29,887 --> 00:27:31,587
All right.
Okay, thank you.

476
00:27:31,622 --> 00:27:34,857
I'll meditate on it.
I...

477
00:27:34,892 --> 00:27:37,960
Right now, I'm staying.

478
00:27:37,995 --> 00:27:42,164
Then you're just fancy scarf
wrapped around an idiot.

479
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,633
You know what?
If it's so bad, you get out!

480
00:27:44,669 --> 00:27:47,436
You leave, I'll leave.

481
00:27:47,471 --> 00:27:50,639
I cannot leave.
Thanks for reminder.

482
00:27:50,675 --> 00:27:53,676
What--what,
you're trapped here?

483
00:27:53,711 --> 00:27:56,245
Remarkably like that.

484
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,347
Incorporate bond.

485
00:27:58,382 --> 00:28:00,416
Even I cannot break.

486
00:28:00,451 --> 00:28:02,318
Why?

487
00:28:02,353 --> 00:28:06,488
What did you do?

488
00:28:06,524 --> 00:28:09,291
I'm not drunk enough
to talk about it.

489
00:28:14,699 --> 00:28:19,101
Okay!

490
00:28:19,136 --> 00:28:21,203
I make love to many students.

491
00:28:21,239 --> 00:28:25,641
And then I fucked the wrong one.

492
00:28:25,676 --> 00:28:28,077
Oops.

493
00:28:28,112 --> 00:28:31,080
They sent you here?
God.

494
00:28:31,115 --> 00:28:32,615
It was that...

495
00:28:36,621 --> 00:28:39,588
Or give up magic.

496
00:28:39,624 --> 00:28:42,591
- Like you're telling me to.
- Yes.

497
00:28:42,627 --> 00:28:45,127
<i>I made my choice.</i>

498
00:29:00,378 --> 00:29:03,145
Wakey, wakey.

499
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:06,315
You have 15 minutes
to save your life.

500
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:09,518
Tell me, if you were in charge,

501
00:29:09,553 --> 00:29:12,655
how would the FU Fighters
fix Fillory?

502
00:29:14,325 --> 00:29:17,026
It's an illusion spell.

503
00:29:17,061 --> 00:29:18,527
Party trick, really.
It'll only last

504
00:29:18,562 --> 00:29:21,463
as long as your skin's wet.

505
00:29:21,499 --> 00:29:22,998
You first.

506
00:29:23,034 --> 00:29:26,235
Yeah. You know, this is
the weirdest foreplay.

507
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,404
Oh, my God. Stop.

508
00:29:28,439 --> 00:29:30,739
Robe off!

509
00:29:34,145 --> 00:29:37,012
Whoa, what is that?

510
00:29:37,048 --> 00:29:38,547
Oh, right, uh...

511
00:29:38,582 --> 00:29:40,082
You joined some kinda gang?

512
00:29:40,117 --> 00:29:42,017
Yes.

513
00:29:42,053 --> 00:29:43,385
Okay.

514
00:29:43,421 --> 00:29:46,121
Hop in.

515
00:30:11,115 --> 00:30:13,282
Did it work?

516
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,223
Oh, shit.

517
00:30:21,258 --> 00:30:22,791
Don't judge me, please.

518
00:30:22,827 --> 00:30:26,662
I'm not. I'm just
putting it all together.

519
00:30:26,697 --> 00:30:29,565
You, Charlie.

520
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,334
That's why he's
at Brakebills South.

521
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:33,669
I mean, I had a lot of theories.

522
00:30:33,704 --> 00:30:35,738
Shh.

523
00:30:35,773 --> 00:30:38,307
You're ruining it.

524
00:30:38,342 --> 00:30:42,811
Just tell me what you think
when you look at me.

525
00:30:42,847 --> 00:30:46,348
And can you maybe try
a Russian accent?

526
00:30:57,294 --> 00:31:00,629
You didn't wanna...

527
00:31:00,664 --> 00:31:02,865
This is what I miss the most.

528
00:31:07,872 --> 00:31:11,340
So...

529
00:31:11,375 --> 00:31:13,142
your turn.

530
00:31:37,601 --> 00:31:40,702
It's her.

531
00:31:40,738 --> 00:31:42,438
It's your memories.

532
00:31:45,776 --> 00:31:49,678
Well?
Anything you wanna say?

533
00:31:51,816 --> 00:31:54,783
I just really fucking miss you.

534
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:49,499
What...

535
00:32:49,535 --> 00:32:53,770
- is that?
- Yeah.

536
00:32:53,806 --> 00:32:56,239
Um, hey, I--
I've gotta get home.

537
00:32:56,275 --> 00:32:58,976
Um...

538
00:32:59,011 --> 00:33:00,911
I had a good time.

539
00:33:00,946 --> 00:33:03,413
You don't have to go.
We can do it again.

540
00:33:03,449 --> 00:33:05,015
You said yesterday
was cheat day.

541
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,883
You can't...

542
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:09,419
You can't cheat every day.

543
00:33:09,455 --> 00:33:12,155
I won't tell.

544
00:33:12,191 --> 00:33:15,859
No, I don't want to.

545
00:33:15,894 --> 00:33:18,095
So, what, you're...
done with me?

546
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:20,797
I--I was helping you.

547
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,532
That's not what I said.

548
00:33:22,568 --> 00:33:25,502
Tell me, then.
What are you saying?

549
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,907
Last night was...

550
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:36,446
It felt really good,
and it was...

551
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:42,419
Probably exactly what I needed,
but I...

552
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:47,290
It was also really weird and sad
and I feel awful.

553
00:33:47,326 --> 00:33:51,128
I feel worse than before.

554
00:33:51,163 --> 00:33:53,163
Apologies for my terrible life.

555
00:33:56,568 --> 00:33:59,169
I just don't wanna
use magic like that.

556
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,576
I'm sorry for
everything you lost.

557
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,483
I'll see you at work.

558
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:26,296
It is after much deliberation
that I have decided...

559
00:34:26,331 --> 00:34:28,265
we will not
execute the prisoner.

560
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,133
What?

561
00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:32,836
Your Majesty, I'm--

562
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:34,438
It is in Fillory's
best interest.

563
00:34:34,473 --> 00:34:37,874
We agreed to have the prisoner
executed today.

564
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:40,577
We did.
But I changed my mind.

565
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:45,148
Well, I didn't.

566
00:34:45,184 --> 00:34:46,450
And I'm High Queen.

567
00:34:46,485 --> 00:34:48,385
The Queen may voice her opinion,

568
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:52,189
but ultimate judgment
belongs to the King.

569
00:34:52,224 --> 00:34:56,893
So this is what
the patriarchy smells like?

570
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:58,962
It's not the freshest.

571
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:03,533
You are a king.
Act like it.

572
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:06,536
I'm not just a king.

573
00:35:06,572 --> 00:35:08,305
Fen's pregnant.

574
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:11,241
I'm gonna be a father.

575
00:35:12,878 --> 00:35:15,946
Mm.

576
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:18,081
And I would like
to raise my child

577
00:35:18,117 --> 00:35:23,253
in a world that does not just
kill its problems away.

578
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:27,891
We hear them and we
address them accordingly.

579
00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:30,093
That is fucking stupid.

580
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:32,429
You wanna rule a kingdom?
Guess what.

581
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:36,299
People are gonna die
no matter what.

582
00:35:36,335 --> 00:35:39,002
Just trying to make sure
that it isn't you, okay?

583
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:49,379
<i>Julia, I'll check you in.</i>

584
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:51,148
<i>Dr. Higgins will be
ready shortly.</i>

585
00:35:53,051 --> 00:35:54,551
Okay.

586
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:10,300
I'm sorry, you're not in here.

587
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:11,501
Excuse me?

588
00:36:11,537 --> 00:36:13,570
You don't have an appointment.

589
00:36:13,605 --> 00:36:16,173
The doctor gave me one.
I mean, there must be a mistake.

590
00:36:16,208 --> 00:36:18,508
I'm sorry, but without an
appointment, I can't let you in.

591
00:36:18,544 --> 00:36:21,077
Look, it's Wicker.
Julia Wicker.

592
00:36:21,113 --> 00:36:22,612
You just said my name
two seconds ago.

593
00:36:22,648 --> 00:36:24,481
Can you just pick up the phone
and ask her?

594
00:36:29,154 --> 00:36:32,088
Doctor, there's a woman
claiming she's a patient.

595
00:36:32,124 --> 00:36:33,390
No, she doesn't.

596
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:36,526
Uh, Julia Wicker.

597
00:36:36,562 --> 00:36:38,528
But, Doctor--

598
00:36:38,564 --> 00:36:41,464
Okay.

599
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,467
- You can go ahead.
- Yeah, thanks.

600
00:36:44,503 --> 00:36:47,270
I'll be right here.

601
00:36:58,208 --> 00:37:01,477
No geese!

602
00:37:01,512 --> 00:37:03,512
Oh.

603
00:37:03,547 --> 00:37:06,148
Phew.

604
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:08,584
You finish table.
Good work.

605
00:37:08,619 --> 00:37:11,453
Yeah, so can we get to this?

606
00:37:11,489 --> 00:37:14,123
Enough "Karate Kid" bullshit.

607
00:37:14,158 --> 00:37:16,258
Not bullshit.

608
00:37:18,496 --> 00:37:21,096
Ask yourself a question:

609
00:37:21,132 --> 00:37:24,667
What will a Magician need
if dark days come?

610
00:37:24,702 --> 00:37:27,069
Answer: magic.

611
00:37:27,104 --> 00:37:28,504
But if it is gone,
it is gone, you say.

612
00:37:28,539 --> 00:37:32,274
Not so, if you store it
like a battery.

613
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:34,476
That's what I am building.

614
00:37:42,353 --> 00:37:44,119
Those knots?

615
00:37:44,155 --> 00:37:46,655
Old class project,
tied with magic.

616
00:37:46,691 --> 00:37:50,693
That table, stained
through with magic.

617
00:37:50,728 --> 00:37:55,597
You release the energy,
I store it for rainy day.

618
00:37:55,633 --> 00:37:59,902
So my hands, are you
gonna teach me or what?

619
00:37:59,937 --> 00:38:03,105
You can travel to Fillory.

620
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:07,576
It's the worst place
in the universe, yeah.

621
00:38:07,611 --> 00:38:11,146
You go there.
Get this.

622
00:38:11,182 --> 00:38:13,449
Moss. You need moss.

623
00:38:13,484 --> 00:38:16,151
It's amazing.
Can carry current.

624
00:38:16,187 --> 00:38:20,255
Do not care.

625
00:38:22,727 --> 00:38:25,427
I'll get it.

626
00:38:32,737 --> 00:38:35,003
Gods, it's good to see you.

627
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:36,372
You asshole!

628
00:38:36,407 --> 00:38:38,173
You come here with no warning

629
00:38:38,209 --> 00:38:39,675
and try to kill my husband.

630
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:42,077
Of course I did.

631
00:38:42,113 --> 00:38:44,046
I thought you were waiting.

632
00:38:44,081 --> 00:38:46,048
I'm not a FU Fighter anymore.

633
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:48,016
You always knew
that one day I'd have to--

634
00:38:48,052 --> 00:38:51,553
Marry him, yes, and then
you'd be here, on the inside.

635
00:38:51,589 --> 00:38:56,024
You can't tell me that you don't
care about Fillory anymore.

636
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,760
I'm pregnant.

637
00:39:01,465 --> 00:39:03,665
- Then for the child.
- What?

638
00:39:03,701 --> 00:39:05,634
All I ask is you get us
information we need to--

639
00:39:05,669 --> 00:39:08,170
Bayler!

640
00:39:08,205 --> 00:39:10,572
Did I say "ask"?

641
00:39:10,608 --> 00:39:13,075
I meant help us.

642
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:16,011
Or I go to your king
and tell him exactly how well

643
00:39:16,046 --> 00:39:18,113
I know his wife.

644
00:39:18,149 --> 00:39:20,282
Then I'll tell him myself.

645
00:39:20,317 --> 00:39:23,719
Word travels fast
about the High King.

646
00:39:23,754 --> 00:39:25,721
Emotional.

647
00:39:25,756 --> 00:39:28,023
Easily wounded.

648
00:39:28,058 --> 00:39:30,526
Try it and see.

649
00:39:30,561 --> 00:39:33,295
Or help the cause.

650
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:40,769
If the FU Fighters
make another move,

651
00:39:40,805 --> 00:39:42,805
I'll kill you myself.

652
00:39:50,648 --> 00:39:53,182
That should do it.

653
00:39:53,217 --> 00:39:55,117
How are you feeling?

654
00:39:55,152 --> 00:40:00,823
Like I finally understand why
people take these kind of drugs.

655
00:40:00,858 --> 00:40:02,357
Okay, we'll start the procedure.

656
00:40:02,393 --> 00:40:03,459
You may feel some cramping,

657
00:40:03,494 --> 00:40:05,594
and that's perfectly normal.

658
00:40:18,476 --> 00:40:21,176
What--what's wrong?

659
00:40:21,212 --> 00:40:24,413
Morning cobwebs.
Excuse me.

660
00:40:24,448 --> 00:40:27,783
- Just relax.
- Okay.

661
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:54,276
What are you doing?

662
00:40:59,483 --> 00:41:01,183
Wait.

663
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,386
Stop.

664
00:41:07,758 --> 00:41:09,391
- Stop it! Wait!
- I can't.

665
00:41:09,426 --> 00:41:11,193
Stop!
What are you doing? No!

666
00:41:11,228 --> 00:41:12,194
Kady!

667
00:41:12,229 --> 00:41:13,595
Kady!

668
00:41:13,631 --> 00:41:15,264
Kady!

669
00:41:15,299 --> 00:41:18,500
- I can't...
- Stop!

670
00:41:28,345 --> 00:41:29,811
Oh, my God.

671
00:41:29,847 --> 00:41:33,282
Holy fuck.

672
00:41:33,317 --> 00:41:37,386
Oh, my--

673
00:41:37,421 --> 00:41:38,754
- Do it.
- What?

674
00:41:38,789 --> 00:41:40,455
Do it. You have wards.

675
00:41:40,491 --> 00:41:42,624
The thing, it got to her.
Just get it out of me, Kady.

676
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:43,926
Julia, that is a dead body.

677
00:41:43,961 --> 00:41:46,762
We need to get rid of it
right now.

678
00:41:46,797 --> 00:41:48,597
Fuck, Jules.

679
00:41:48,632 --> 00:41:50,566
We will find another way.

680
