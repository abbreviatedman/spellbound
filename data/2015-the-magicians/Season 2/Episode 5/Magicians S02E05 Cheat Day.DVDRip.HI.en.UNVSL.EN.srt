No, if we're gonna
talk about what we did,

call it what it is.

so fucking stupid!

have known better.

between magic and miracles.

gonna glide in and save us...

It sounds so naive
to ever believe in that.

Look, there is one
way through this,

370
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,352
and that is to find out what
happened 40 years ago.

fuck out of Reynard.

your face for a professor,

402

Charlie tried to save you.
