1
00:00:01,101 --> 00:00:02,278
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:04,703
You may address me
as Reynard the Fox,

3
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:07,104
trickster of the
faithful, the very stupid.

4
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:11,773
You must be Marina.

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,409
I need you to tell me about
the thing that killed you.

6
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,516
There was a girl.

7
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,387
Forty years ago, she
banished Reynard from Earth.

8
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:25,502
<i>Charlie, my brother...
He was really, really good.</i>

9
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,170
<i>You know that spell I did
on the first day of class?</i>

10
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:28,754
<i>With The Glass Horse?
He taught me that.</i>

11
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,421
I fell for this professor.

12
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:31,556
He was married.

13
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:35,400
I thought I could make
him love me again.

14
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:37,801
If I could make
myself prettier...

15
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:38,971
<i>I really believed</i>

16
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,599
<i>he might actually be
able to undo what I did.</i>

17
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:42,975
<i>It burned...</i>

18
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,035
Until he wasn't there anymore.

19
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:47,445
I gave up magic, and
never looked back.

20
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:51,851
No!

21
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:54,287
<i>Alice was gone.</i>

22
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:56,983
<i>There's a creature. It's
called the White Lady.</i>

23
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:58,452
I want my hands back.

24
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:03,023
Alice Quinn. Bring
her back to life.

25
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,230
I can't.

26
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:05,909
Is there nothing
else you desire?

27
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:06,933
Send me home.

28
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,843
I spoke with Professor
Lipson about the tests she ran.

29
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:21,141
But, I'm sorry to say that we
don't even know where to start.

30
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:23,048
Okay, is this a normal
candle, or what...

31
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:30,687
Of course. You cure
your own hands just fine,

32
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,669
but mine, you can't do a
fucking thing about, huh?

33
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:36,755
Broken or not, my
hands are my hands.

34
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:39,500
Yours are something else.

35
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,096
There's nothing we can do.

36
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:44,103
And Brakebills continues
its tradition of fucking my shit!

37
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:45,933
There's nothing we can do here.

38
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,906
There are other options.

39
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:53,140
One, I send you to someone
who may know more.

40
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,339
Yes, who is it?

41
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:55,643
Professor Mayakovsky.

42
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:58,580
The drunk perv
in the igloo? Pass.

43
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,011
What's option two?

44
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:02,016
Hmm, well.

45
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:04,786
You won't have to worry about
your hands, or magic at all.

46
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,952
It's actually where
I sent Quentin.

47
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:08,654
Where's Quentin?

48
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,353
So we finally get to the
cashier, and guess what?

49
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:25,608
Hmm? Left my wallet in the car.

50
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,180
Oh, man.

51
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,511
Talk about bad timing.

52
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,110
Yeah.

53
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:34,179
Hey, does "Donut House"...
Does that taste like donuts?

54
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:35,955
I just use that thing for soup.

55
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,614
Soup?

56
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:40,216
The fuck?

57
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,285
Hello?

58
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,282
Professor Mayakovsky?

59
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:53,823
Shit!

60
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:55,434
Hey.

61
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,669
Hey, let me down, I'm a student!

62
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:03,967
Dick.

63
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:10,217
<i>Chicago Register,</i> July '76.

64
00:04:10,283 --> 00:04:12,829
You know, dead or not, Marina
could have been a little more specific.

65
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,516
I still don't know
what I'm looking for.

66
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:18,336
Look, banishing Reynard had to
take an insane amount of energy.

67
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:21,657
So, any sort of strange
event or aberration.

68
00:04:22,629 --> 00:04:25,155
Yeah, that's literally
the definition of news.

69
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:26,928
We'll know it when we see it.

70
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:45,751
I need some fuel.

71
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:03,736
You okay?

72
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:10,996
What is it, the
second time today?

73
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:13,036
Third.

74
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,459
Oh, God. Jules, I...

75
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:28,718
Fuck!

76
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:32,089
Fuck! Fuck! Why...
Come on, come on. Sit.

77
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,968
Why won't it just end?

78
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:37,937
Why does it just keep
getting worse and worse?

79
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:39,464
I'm so sorry.

80
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:42,968
Whatever. What's the spell
to terminate it or whatever?

81
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:46,178
There's stuff out there, but
it's all shady dark ages shit

82
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:48,408
from before modern medicine.

83
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,107
You don't cauterize a paper cut

84
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,085
with a crazy medieval blowtorch.

85
00:05:53,153 --> 00:05:55,315
That sounds like
exactly what I want to do.

86
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:59,183
Not if it erases your uterus
and kidneys along with the fetus.

87
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,160
Jesus.

88
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:02,685
Hey, it's...

89
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:08,792
It's okay, Jules. This is a simple,
totally mundane procedure.

90
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:12,498
Is it? 'Cause it might not be a "simple,
totally mundane" human embryo.

91
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:13,572
I mean...

92
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:18,673
I don't even know if it's
Reynard's or Richard's.

93
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,015
Right now, it is
just a clump of cells.

94
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,287
Okay, so let's just put
a pin in all this, okay?

95
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,581
We'll make an appointment.

96
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,030
Your Majesty...

97
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:40,590
It's ready.

98
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,501
At the very least, I hope you
solved the carbonation issue.

99
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:47,166
We had to dump that last
glass in another world, you know.

100
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,807
Still bubbling.

101
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:56,316
Oh, the miles we must walk.

102
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:01,248
My King, I have the best news!

103
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:03,785
If that rabbit was a
prosecco, I'd agree.

104
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:06,049
This isn't just a rabbit.

105
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:07,793
Pregnant.

106
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:08,861
Jesus.

107
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,588
We're going to be parents!

108
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,095
That rabbit knows
if you're, uh...

109
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,134
Pregnant. Okay, okay.

110
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:19,571
You're not smiling.

111
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:21,335
I'm sorry. It's just, you see...

112
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:23,206
Pregnant. Okay, rabbit, chill!

113
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,008
Uh-uh, where do you
think you're going?

114
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:31,478
It may suck all the
moisture from my tongue,

115
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:33,611
but damned if I'm not
going to toast to this shit.

116
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,523
To our violently
attractive progeny.

117
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:52,765
Hey, yo! Let me down! Okay?
What the fuck is this shit?

118
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:56,603
What do you want?

119
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,975
My hands can't
cast spells anymore.

120
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:03,611
This is not Mayakovsky's
Home For Magically Inert.

121
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:06,380
But, maybe an exchange...

122
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,249
What do you got in mind?

123
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:14,250
I'm in the middle of a project.
Help me, I do what I can.

124
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:19,596
I'm in. Okay.

125
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,785
Is everybody out
here really so lifeless?

126
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:32,938
Yes. We are. We are.
That's why we drink.

127
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:35,205
Well, I drank just
fine as a Magician.

128
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,477
Yeah, because your world
was so overwhelming and scary,

129
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:38,910
and you needed
a break from it all.

130
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,464
Now you're going to drink because
each day is so goddamn dull,

131
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:43,548
and that takes a lot more booze.

132
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,986
Do you ever cast
anymore? God, no.

133
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,640
I'm sorry, that was stupid.

134
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,228
No, it's okay.

135
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:53,456
I mean, nobody ever gives up
magic because everything's peachy.

136
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,064
You want to tell me?

137
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:05,201
Uh... I'm sorry.

138
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:06,906
No, I shouldn't have asked.

139
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,615
I can see that it's recent.

140
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,117
It's fucking madness.

141
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,417
Teaching that stuff
to kids. I mean, kids.

142
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:17,643
It's like, what's the point?

143
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:20,236
You know? 'Cause it feels like
for every one thing that we fix,

144
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,286
five shitty things
spring up in its place.

145
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:25,258
Because each spell is
just another complication.

146
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:26,993
That we cast
another spell to fix.

147
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,092
Repeat, repeat, repeat.

148
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:32,401
Until there's no spell
left, and you're just...

149
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:36,670
You're left with... A
big fucking problem.

150
00:09:40,447 --> 00:09:42,848
Oh, shit! I have
a meeting in 15.

151
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:44,883
Ooh.

152
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:50,447
I'm sorry. That was just reflex.

153
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:53,152
Uh, that... I... Um...

154
00:09:53,827 --> 00:09:54,827
Just...

155
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:59,127
Just put this on the company
card. They won't notice.

156
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:05,570
I am happy. Yay, a baby.

157
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,874
Eliot. What is this about?

158
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:13,203
I really want to know.

159
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:17,817
My father was not the best.

160
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:18,908
Wine, Your Majesty.

161
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,179
Bad dad.

162
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,317
So, I suppose I don't
exactly have the proper,

163
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:27,521
uh, uh...

164
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,228
Template to...

165
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,356
Quiet!

166
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,432
You are not welcome
here, Child of Earth!

167
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:39,671
Eliot!

168
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:49,548
Wait!

169
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:52,979
This is not over,
Child of Earth.

170
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:58,857
Dungeon.

171
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,323
What the hell was that about?

172
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:06,824
I tried expressing my emotions.

173
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:08,699
Lesson learned.

174
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:17,703
Shittiest security ever.

175
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:22,745
So, what are we supposed
to do? Ship him back to Loria?

176
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:25,808
Actually, Your Highness,
he's not from Loria.

177
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:27,581
He's a native Fillorian.

178
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:30,351
My own people
are trying to kill me?

179
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,150
So French.

180
00:11:32,492 --> 00:11:35,121
They're commoners. Not to worry.

181
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:37,493
Oh, whoa, whoa. I'm worried.

182
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:40,090
I urge a public execution today.

183
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:44,431
Might I suggest strangulation?
For the symbolism.

184
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,264
We don't wish
to fall to his level.

185
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:48,434
The Bed of a Thousand
Spikes should do just fine.

186
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:57,875
Her Slowness suggests tying
each of his limbs to a centaur,

187
00:11:57,951 --> 00:12:00,511
and as they stretch
him inch by inch,

188
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:05,423
a fifth centaur "sets
the spike," if you will.

189
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:06,891
Jesus! No.

190
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,259
Everyone, out. This is a
matter for the Queen and me.

191
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:13,965
That sloth is psychotic.

192
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:16,967
They're all psychotic.

193
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,436
Did you hear how
Tick said "commoners?"

194
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:21,738
When we're the least
snobby people in a room,

195
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,639
there's something
wrong with the room.

196
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:32,484
Yes?

197
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:34,616
I wanted to apologize.

198
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,114
I'm sorry, um...

199
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:39,915
Okay.

200
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:44,396
What?

201
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:49,468
I just... I don't know if
you accepted my apology.

202
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:52,261
Yes.

203
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:56,033
Okay. Actually, no.

204
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,408
No, I don't.

205
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:02,414
We had just talked about
how terrible magic is,

206
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:04,246
and then you went and did it.

207
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:07,082
That was just a tiny spell.

208
00:13:07,186 --> 00:13:09,155
There are a lot of
companies like this.

209
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:11,123
I'm sure Fogg can find
another one for you.

210
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:15,927
Okay.

211
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,376
<i>They're useless, right?</i>

212
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:39,346
Well, maybe not "useless."

213
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,750
You can still grab hold
of things, wave hello,

214
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,588
rub away a lonely night.

215
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:49,623
Okay, but for magic?
For magic, useless.

216
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,898
How's your travel?

217
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,493
Fine.

218
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:59,572
Aim's good. I just can't
take people with me.

219
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:01,602
Some might call that blessing.

220
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:03,904
Yeah, well, the option
would be nice, so...

221
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:06,188
I mean, can you help me?
What are we doing here?

222
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:10,616
I can help you. But
first, your end of deal.

223
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,058
Take out all the knots.

224
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:27,600
What the hell?

225
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:31,037
Miss Wicker? Uh, Julia.

226
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:34,168
The test was positive.

227
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,769
If you'd like, we can
discuss your options.

228
00:14:38,845 --> 00:14:40,404
I want an abortion.

229
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,314
Okay. That's something that
we can perform here in-office.

230
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:44,844
Great. Uh, today?

231
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,163
Unfortunately, we
do have a waiting list,

232
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,707
but it should just
be a couple of days.

233
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:51,256
Days?

234
00:14:52,992 --> 00:14:57,794
Doctor, I can't wait a
couple of days. Please. I...

235
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:03,433
If I suspect abuse, I'm
obligated to report it.

236
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,706
Julia, you're safe here.

237
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:08,801
You can talk about
what happened.

238
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:10,771
No one is above the law.

239
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,471
Uh, I'm sorry.

240
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,216
I wish that were true.

241
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:22,088
Look, I just want
this to be over.

242
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,323
And you can help me.

243
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:27,420
Please.

244
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,257
Okay.

245
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,566
We'll set you up for
an ultrasound today.

246
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,625
Tomorrow we can
perform the procedure.

247
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,093
We open at 8:00.

248
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,768
Thank you. I'll see you then.

249
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:56,087
Hi.

250
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:58,385
Leave. You don't
get to say that.

251
00:15:58,491 --> 00:15:59,515
And why not?

252
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:00,718
Uh,

253
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,421
because you're in our castle.

254
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,553
Which is on my land.

255
00:16:04,831 --> 00:16:09,292
Uh, excuse me, my manners.
Um, I'm Eliot, High King of Fillory.

256
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:13,897
And I'm Bayler. A proud
soldier of Fillorians United.

257
00:16:14,507 --> 00:16:15,507
A FU Fighter.

258
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:19,277
Did you say "Foo
Fighter?" Margo, behave.

259
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:22,679
And we will not rest until a
Fillorian sits upon the throne.

260
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:26,716
Okay. Tell Ember.
He issued the decree.

261
00:16:26,786 --> 00:16:31,121
We will execute every Child of
Earth that crosses into our land,

262
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,022
until there are
none left to kill.

263
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:35,893
And yet, you laugh.

264
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:39,662
I mean, a "Foo Fighter?"

265
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:40,732
Margo.

266
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:44,527
If we execute him,
then he's a martyr.

267
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:45,971
Shit.

268
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,140
When was the
last time either of us

269
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,802
dealt with a
political insurgency?

270
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:54,370
Unless getting kicked out of a
five-some counts, first for me.

271
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:55,447
Same.

272
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,814
I'm thinking we should
probably bone up.

273
00:16:57,884 --> 00:16:59,284
Like, study?

274
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,980
I'll grab what I can from
the Brakebills library.

275
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:05,149
Fine. And grab some
Adderall while you're there.

276
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,196
Okay! I'm done!

277
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:21,865
Shit! What... Do not... Don't
sneak up on me like that!

278
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,707
This is my house.

279
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:26,575
Look, I finished untying your
bondage kit. You gonna teach me now?

280
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:29,105
You finish first step.

281
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:32,518
Next, that table.

282
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:36,916
What about it?

283
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:38,082
You make it sawdust.

284
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:41,524
Do not worry, I give you tool.

285
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:45,288
Enjoy.

286
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:00,412
What're you still doing here?

287
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:03,749
I'm just finishing up.

288
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,519
Gonna jerk it?
Break in the office?

289
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,418
No! What? No! I'm...

290
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:12,458
It's the only place I can. Wife
and two kids, no privacy at home.

291
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,188
I'm not doing that...

292
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:17,429
Here.

293
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:19,222
Just saying,
there's no judgment.

294
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:20,832
<i>Adiós.</i>

295
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:29,139
I owe you an apology
for being a bitch.

296
00:18:29,976 --> 00:18:31,308
Could you knock, please?

297
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,072
What, were you
masturbating in your office?

298
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:37,148
No.

299
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,184
Whatever, I do.

300
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,183
What is this place?

301
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:47,784
I'm sorry again about the spell.

302
00:18:47,994 --> 00:18:54,298
I'm sorry for making you feel
sorry. It was just a stupid spell.

303
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:57,202
Thank you.

304
00:18:57,703 --> 00:18:58,796
Want some?

305
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,202
Vodka, bit of lime.

306
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,336
You should stay.

307
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:11,840
Forget what I said earlier. I
think we'd be good friends.

308
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:15,145
I would like that.

309
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:19,324
What the hell are we still
doing in the office, right?

310
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:20,752
Let's get out of here.

311
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,852
Mmm. Finish that. Come on!

312
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:24,195
Okay.

313
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:25,355
Yes!

314
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:34,273
Take a break.

315
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:38,274
No trick, no test, I promise.

316
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:47,876
That's it?

317
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,983
Take your balls out of
your purse and drink!

318
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,900
No, if we're gonna
talk about what we did,

319
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,453
then we have to
call it what it is.

320
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,624
It's stupid! It's
so fucking stupid!

321
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,759
It's the stupidest I've
ever fucking been.

322
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,962
Reynard set us up.

323
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,476
Yeah, but I should
have known better.

324
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:09,067
You know, I knew the difference
between magic and miracles.

325
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:12,103
One is real, and one
is a lie with sparkles.

326
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:17,111
Like a nice, female god was
gonna glide in and save us...

327
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:21,148
It sounds so naive
to ever believe in that.

328
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,151
Look, there is one
way through this,

329
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,352
and that is to find out what
happened 40 years ago.

330
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,060
Yeah, and banish the
fuck out of Reynard.

331
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:32,695
Yeah, so let's just get this
pesky abortion out of the way,

332
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:34,290
and that's next on the list.

333
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,668
I know this is a
straightforward procedure.

334
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,968
It's probably, you
know, the simplest thing

335
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:42,201
I've had to deal with in months.

336
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:45,208
But I'm nervous.

337
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,450
I had one.

338
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:58,117
He was a drummer.

339
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,994
And he said he couldn't
get it up with a condom.

340
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,998
I remember the night before.

341
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:12,998
It...

342
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:14,939
It felt...

343
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:18,308
It felt lonely.

344
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:22,714
Yeah.

345
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:25,009
But you're not alone.

346
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,215
I'm your best bitch, remember?

347
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:31,719
Okay. Yeah.

348
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:35,228
Okay, your turn. Truth or dare?

349
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:37,423
Truth.

350
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:40,338
Do you still blame yourself?

351
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,090
Shit.

352
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:43,859
Okay.

353
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:47,498
Sorry. No, I think I'm
drunker than I think I am.

354
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,003
Was that a sentence?

355
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:51,507
No, I said truth.

356
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:55,710
So, do you know what happened?

357
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:58,740
I mean, just what Alice told me.

358
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:02,346
That you changed
your face for a professor,

359
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:06,051
and it got screwed up, and
Charlie tried to save you.

360
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,923
Yeah, that's the gist.

361
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,785
How is Alice?

362
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:13,229
Uh, Alice is dead.

363
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:26,409
I don't blame myself.

364
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,377
Except for when I first wake up.

365
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:37,746
And when I go to bed,
and all the time in between.

366
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:43,728
Your turn.

367
00:22:46,632 --> 00:22:47,793
Dare.

368
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:49,899
Dare...

369
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:57,200
My dare is to smoke weed?
That's very middle school.

370
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:01,579
Oh, oh.

371
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,680
Do you know...

372
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:07,746
Do you know Weizenheim's Third?

373
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,914
A tiny little weather
suspension spell.

374
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:11,321
I thought you didn't... I don't.

375
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:14,655
This doesn't count.
Today's a cheat day.

376
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:16,153
Right.

377
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:21,063
Oh, the trick to this one is
that you enchant your lips.

378
00:23:33,312 --> 00:23:35,008
And you're a smoke artiste. Mmm.

379
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,216
Okay. Your turn.

380
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:38,676
Don't burn yourself.

381
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:40,813
How do you do it? Oh, um...

382
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:42,448
Okay, let me.

383
00:24:03,242 --> 00:24:05,040
You're a fucking dork.

384
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:07,903
You're just jealous
I'm such a quick study.

385
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:09,408
Yeah.

386
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:11,249
Okay.

387
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:22,554
What is it?

388
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,254
This one's my favorite.

389
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:35,503
It's my favorite, too.

390
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:41,245
Ooh! Come on in.

391
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,372
Okay.

392
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,812
Emily Greenstreet,
living the loft life, huh?

393
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:50,884
Yeah.

394
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,190
Wine opener?

395
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:54,459
One of those
drawers. One of them.

396
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:57,062
Wine opener.

397
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:59,222
Uh, wine opener, wine opener.

398
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:00,561
Hey.

399
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:04,095
I want to do a spell.

400
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:11,769
Why don't we keep drinking and
make some really, really bad decisions?

401
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:16,141
That sounds, I don't
know, kind of fun. Okay.

402
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:18,875
You'll like it.

403
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,820
Mmm. Come on.

404
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,155
Cheat day.

405
00:25:27,793 --> 00:25:29,261
The Defenestration of Prague.

406
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:30,472
No, you already said that.

407
00:25:30,496 --> 00:25:31,987
There were two. Mmm.

408
00:25:32,731 --> 00:25:36,168
Look, any hope you had of
saving this guy is out the window.

409
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:37,430
Like the guys in Prague.

410
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:41,696
Shit.

411
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:46,042
Eliot, we said we'd do
whatever actually works.

412
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:50,573
Fine. I'll tell the
Council in the morning.

413
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:54,651
But I'll do it. The man's
life is my burden to bear.

414
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:57,989
Get over yourself, Ned Stark.

415
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,058
Ned Stark.

416
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:16,472
Do you even like magic?

417
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:17,942
Yeah, like...

418
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:23,246
Like I like money, or food,
or any other useful shit.

419
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:25,784
Money or food don't
explode in your face.

420
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:29,451
You came to Brakebills
only to ease your suffering.

421
00:26:29,621 --> 00:26:33,114
The voices. It was
all chore and burden,

422
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:35,821
but you saved
yourself, Traveler.

423
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:37,589
Good.

424
00:26:38,664 --> 00:26:40,496
Maybe you're simply done.

425
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,666
Now is your chance. Walk away.

426
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:46,828
Why? Chance at what?

427
00:26:49,241 --> 00:26:52,109
Few years of happy life.

428
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:59,314
There is bad surprise
in store. For everyone.

429
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:01,781
What surprise?

430
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:07,916
Energy currents
should be constant.

431
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:11,155
But it's not?

432
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:13,025
Why?

433
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,026
There is something
happening to magic.

434
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:19,670
The Wellspring in Fillory.

435
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:21,331
The current is sputtering.

436
00:27:21,406 --> 00:27:22,806
And they're trying to fix it.

437
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:26,645
Maybe it's going to
disappear. If that's the case...

438
00:27:26,712 --> 00:27:27,771
Shit could get real.

439
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:31,912
If magic goes, it will be
very bad time to be Magician,

440
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:35,352
so, consider the advantage
of getting out now.

441
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,082
All right. Okay, thank you.

442
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:39,186
I'll meditate on it. I...

443
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:41,993
Right now I'm staying.

444
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:47,894
Then you're just a fancy
scarf wrapped around an idiot!

445
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:50,162
You know what, if it's
so bad, you get out!

446
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,300
You leave, I'll leave.

447
00:27:53,372 --> 00:27:56,399
I cannot leave.
Thanks for reminder.

448
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:58,506
What? What, you're trapped here?

449
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:01,511
Remarkably like that.

450
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:05,676
In corporate bond.
Even I cannot break.

451
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:07,309
Why?

452
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,015
What did you do?

453
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:15,019
I'm not drunk
enough to talk about it.

454
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:21,895
Okay!

455
00:28:24,937 --> 00:28:26,929
I make love to many students.

456
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:30,442
And then, I fuck the wrong one.

457
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:32,643
Oops.

458
00:28:34,012 --> 00:28:36,675
And they sent you here? God.

459
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:38,745
It was that...

460
00:28:42,454 --> 00:28:44,047
Or give up magic.

461
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:47,319
Like you're telling me to?

462
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:48,426
Yes.

463
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,285
<i>I made my choice.</i>

464
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,107
Wakey-wakey.

465
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,879
You have 15 minutes
to save your life.

466
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:15,253
Tell me, if you were in charge,

467
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,516
how would the FU
Fighters fix Fillory?

468
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:22,390
It's an illusion spell.

469
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:26,456
Party trick, really. Only lasts
as long as your skin's wet.

470
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:28,527
You first.

471
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,998
Yeah? You know, this
is the weirdest foreplay.

472
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:35,040
Oh, my God, stop. Robe off.

473
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:41,345
Whoa, what is that?

474
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:44,406
Oh, right, I...

475
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:45,712
You joined some kind of gang?

476
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:46,975
Yes.

477
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:50,048
Okay. Hop in.

478
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:18,683
Did it work?

479
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:27,020
Oh, shit.

480
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,559
Don't judge me, please.

481
00:30:28,627 --> 00:30:32,462
I'm not. I'm just
putting it all together.

482
00:30:32,698 --> 00:30:34,690
You. Charlie.

483
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:37,460
That's why he's
at Brakebills South.

484
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,732
I mean, I had a
lot of theories. Shh.

485
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:42,831
You're ruining it.

486
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:47,738
Just tell me what you
think when you look at me.

487
00:30:48,814 --> 00:30:51,147
And could you, maybe,
try a Russian accent?

488
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:04,493
You didn't wanna...

489
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:08,590
This is what I missed the most.

490
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:15,068
So...

491
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:18,302
Your turn.

492
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:44,893
It's her.

493
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:47,972
It's your memories.

494
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:53,168
Well?

495
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,380
Anything you wanna say?

496
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:59,477
I just really fucking miss you.

497
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:55,431
What is...

498
00:32:56,942 --> 00:32:57,966
Is that...

499
00:32:58,043 --> 00:32:59,170
Yeah.

500
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:01,839
Um, hey, I...

501
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,082
I've gotta get home. Um...

502
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:08,014
I had a good time.

503
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:10,954
You don't have to
go, we can do it again.

504
00:33:11,056 --> 00:33:13,252
You said yesterday was
"cheat day." You can't...

505
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:15,856
You can't cheat every day.

506
00:33:16,928 --> 00:33:18,328
I won't tell.

507
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:21,457
No, I don't want to.

508
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:26,967
So what? You're done
with me? I was helping you.

509
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,234
That's not what I said.

510
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:32,638
Well, tell me then.
What are you saying?

511
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,342
Last night was...

512
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,686
It felt really
good, and it was...

513
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:49,750
Probably exactly
what I needed, but I...

514
00:33:49,828 --> 00:33:52,263
It was also really
weird and sad.

515
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,730
And I feel awful.

516
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:55,864
I feel worse than before.

517
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,302
Apologies for my terrible life.

518
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:06,308
I just don't want to
use magic like that.

519
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:13,684
I'm sorry for
everything you lost.

520
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,081
I'll see you at work.

521
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,064
It is after much deliberation
that I have decided...

522
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:35,436
We will not execute
the prisoner.

523
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:36,707
What?

524
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,934
Your Majesty, I'm...

525
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:41,443
It is in Fillory's
best interest.

526
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,816
We agreed to have the
prisoner executed today.

527
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,383
We did. But I changed my mind.

528
00:34:50,355 --> 00:34:53,757
Well, I didn't. And
I'm High Queen.

529
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:55,724
The Queen may voice her opinion,

530
00:34:55,794 --> 00:34:59,424
but ultimate judgment
belongs to the King.

531
00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:01,523
So this is what the
patriarchy smells like.

532
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:05,569
It's not the freshest.

533
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:10,974
You're a king. Act like it.

534
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:12,336
I'm not just a king.

535
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:15,212
Fen is pregnant.

536
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:18,378
I'm gonna be a father.

537
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:20,951
Mmm.

538
00:35:23,188 --> 00:35:26,420
And I would like to
raise my child in a world

539
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:29,689
that does not just
kill its problems away.

540
00:35:30,562 --> 00:35:34,522
We hear them, and we
address them accordingly.

541
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,135
That is fucking stupid.

542
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:39,060
You want to rule a kingdom?

543
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:42,073
Guess what, people are
going to die, no matter what.

544
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:46,109
Just try to make sure
that it isn't you, okay?

545
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:58,120
<i>Julia? I'll check you in.
Dr. Higgins will be ready shortly.</i>

546
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:01,623
Okay...

547
00:36:15,807 --> 00:36:17,036
I'm sorry, you're not in here.

548
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:20,138
Excuse me? You don't
have an appointment.

549
00:36:20,979 --> 00:36:23,278
The doctor gave me one. I
mean, there must be a mistake.

550
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:25,816
I'm sorry, but without an
appointment, I can't let you in.

551
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:28,045
Look, it's Wicker, Julia Wicker.

552
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:30,179
You just said my
name two seconds ago.

553
00:36:30,255 --> 00:36:31,935
Can you just pick up
the phone and ask her?

554
00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:38,522
Doctor, there's a woman
claiming she's a patient.

555
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:40,526
No, she doesn't.

556
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:42,325
Uh, Julia Wicker.

557
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:44,927
But, Doctor...

558
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:47,095
Okay.

559
00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:49,831
You can go ahead.

560
00:36:50,175 --> 00:36:51,541
Yeah, thanks.

561
00:36:52,077 --> 00:36:53,238
I'll be right here.

562
00:37:07,492 --> 00:37:08,755
No geese!

563
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,121
Oh.

564
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:15,456
Phew.

565
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:17,968
You finish table. Good work.

566
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:22,768
Yeah, so can we get to this?
Enough <i>Karate Kid</i> bullshit!

567
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:25,407
Not bullshit.

568
00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:30,040
Ask yourself a question.

569
00:37:30,515 --> 00:37:34,316
What will a Magician
need if dark days come?

570
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:36,251
Answer, magic.

571
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:38,913
"But if it is gone, it is
gone," you say. Not so.

572
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:41,459
If you store it. Like a battery.

573
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:43,755
That's what I'm building!

574
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:52,830
Those knots?

575
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:56,067
Old class project,
tied with magic.

576
00:37:56,141 --> 00:37:59,805
That table, stained
through with magic.

577
00:38:00,178 --> 00:38:04,115
You release the energy,
I store it. For rainy day.

578
00:38:05,183 --> 00:38:08,620
So, my hands? Are you
gonna teach me or what?

579
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:12,017
You can travel to Fillory.

580
00:38:14,759 --> 00:38:17,024
It's the worst place
in the universe, yeah.

581
00:38:17,095 --> 00:38:19,587
You go there. Get this.

582
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:22,763
"Moss"? You need moss?

583
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:25,564
It's amazing. Can
carry current...

584
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:28,504
Do not care!

585
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,143
I'll get it.

586
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,983
Gods, it's good to
see you. You asshole!

587
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:49,025
You come here with no warning
and try to kill my husband?

588
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:52,420
Of course, I did. I
thought you were waiting.

589
00:38:53,398 --> 00:38:55,196
I'm not a FU Fighter anymore.

590
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:57,098
You always knew that
one day I'd have to...

591
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,728
Marry him, yes, and then
you'd be here, on the inside.

592
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:03,599
You can't tell me that you
don't care about Fillory anymore.

593
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,367
I'm pregnant.

594
00:39:10,982 --> 00:39:12,610
Then for the child... What?

595
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:15,129
All I ask is you get us
information we need to...

596
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:16,280
Bayler!

597
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:19,054
Did I say "ask"?

598
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:23,390
I meant "help us,"
or I go to your king

599
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:26,625
and tell him exactly
how well I know his wife.

600
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:28,966
Then I'll tell him myself.

601
00:39:29,634 --> 00:39:31,967
Word travels fast
about the High King.

602
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:34,328
Emotional.

603
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,340
Easily wounded.

604
00:39:37,408 --> 00:39:38,603
Try it and see.

605
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:41,510
Or help the cause.

606
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:51,785
If the FU Fighters make
another move, I'll kill you myself.

607
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:03,226
That should do it.
How are you feeling?

608
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:07,837
Like I finally understand why
people take these kind of drugs.

609
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,518
Okay, we'll start the procedure.

610
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:13,943
You may feel some cramping,
and that's perfectly normal.

611
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:28,892
What...

612
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,121
What's wrong?

613
00:40:30,628 --> 00:40:33,393
Morning cobwebs. Excuse me.

614
00:40:34,132 --> 00:40:35,132
Just relax.

615
00:40:36,067 --> 00:40:37,228
Okay.

616
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:03,359
What are you doing?

617
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:09,766
Wait.

618
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:13,627
Stop.

619
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,805
Stop it! Wait! I can't.

620
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:20,469
Stop! What are you doing? No!

621
00:41:20,545 --> 00:41:22,776
Kady! Kady!

622
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:24,645
Kady!

623
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:26,943
Stop!

624
00:41:37,862 --> 00:41:42,163
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Fuck.

625
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:43,894
Oh, my...

626
00:41:46,738 --> 00:41:48,104
Do it. What?

627
00:41:48,206 --> 00:41:49,504
Do it. You have wards.

628
00:41:49,574 --> 00:41:51,852
The thing... It got to her...
Just get it out of me, Kady.

629
00:41:51,876 --> 00:41:54,710
Julia, that is a dead body. We
need to get rid of it right now.

630
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,010
Look, Jules. We'll
find another way.

631
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:29,171
Help me.
