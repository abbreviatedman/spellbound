right about them being real.

356

Hades created the Underworld,
runs it with his wife, Persephone.

357

They live in a big
house way over here.

It's a beautiful
area called Elysium.

359
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:40,512
Apparently, they used to
come and go like clockwork,

360
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,214
every fall and spring,

361
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,484

they just disappeared.

doing all this, Richard?

is, if he's even still here,

367

me a damn thing.

I'm flagged as
culpable in his death.

371

help me break them.

372
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,410

do they keep the Shades?

Shades are kept at reception.

didn't seem too keen

Fen is in her human
form in the Fairy Realm,

tried to get clever with our deal.

She's in a hospital room.
She's making them bloom.

527

It's a really obvious
miracle, but that's okay.

is gonna die anyways.

Cool. Um...

532
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:25,008
We were looking for a
Shade. Her name's Julia.

533
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:28,673
Yeah. She looks
like her, kind of.

534
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:31,579

a... She's a mess.

536
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,844
Anything else? Um...

537
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:38,589
She's brave and funny,

538
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,956
and she probably made
friends with some of the

539
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:42,961

540
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:45,964
She's curious, and she
won't take "no" for an answer.

541
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,295
Are you looking for
the kind of new one

543

Persephone's room?

544
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:55,438
Because, you know, we're never

545
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,867
supposed to go in
there. (CHUCKLES)

does sound like her.

know, Q. You keep watch.

that whatever it is, it is increasing.

her so hard that I nearly blew you?

and sometimes, his
competition can get a little rough,

622

It's not surprising. You're
my son. How else could it be?

707
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:27,878
But her, the benevolent
Our Lady Underground?

708

Oh, it is all about her.

to move past that.

You know, turn me back?

About 50 straight
minutes of casting,

722

so I'm gonna need
a minute to recharge.

want any clothes or... Mmm.

her in the dungeon.

Brilliant. Josh, I think you
just invented democracy,
