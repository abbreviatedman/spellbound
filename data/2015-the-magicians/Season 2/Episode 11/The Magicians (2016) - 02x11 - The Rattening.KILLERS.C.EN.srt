00:00:00,223 --> 00:00:02,110
Previously on The Magicians...

00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:03,696
<i>My hands won't cast.</i>

3
00:00:03,732 --> 00:00:06,323
- We can help you, Penny.
- What's the catch?

4
00:00:06,443 --> 00:00:07,642
"Bound in service to the library

5
00:00:07,677 --> 00:00:09,777
up to and after my death"?

6
00:00:09,813 --> 00:00:12,213
<i>- That isn't just any door.
- Then what is it?</i>

7
00:00:12,248 --> 00:00:13,348
The Poison Room.

8
00:00:13,383 --> 00:00:14,682
There is knowledge
behind that door

9
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:16,417
that could destroy
more than just people.

10
00:00:16,453 --> 00:00:17,852
It could destroy worlds.

11
00:00:17,887 --> 00:00:19,420
<i>"The Ars Deicidium"?</i>

12
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:21,222
<i>"The art of killing gods."</i>

13
00:00:21,257 --> 00:00:23,658
King Idri is our honored guest.

14
00:00:23,693 --> 00:00:24,926
<i>We're getting married.</i>

15
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:27,595
One big, royal
polyamorous family.

16
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:29,931
The fairies can bring back
the wellspring?

17
00:00:29,966 --> 00:00:30,932
They can.

18
00:00:30,967 --> 00:00:32,433
And in return?

19
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:34,402
<i>The child that grows in the womb</i>

20
00:00:34,437 --> 00:00:36,004
<i>of the High King's wife.</i>

21
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:38,940
<i>Some friends
and I summoned a goddess.</i>

22
00:00:38,975 --> 00:00:41,609
You may address me
as Reynard the Fox,

23
00:00:41,645 --> 00:00:43,511
<i>trickster of the very stupid.</i>

24
00:00:43,546 --> 00:00:46,180
<i>Reynard's son is John Gaines?</i>

25
00:00:46,216 --> 00:00:47,815
<i>My son...</i>

26
00:00:49,552 --> 00:00:51,819
<i>Jules, I talked to your shade.</i>

27
00:00:51,855 --> 00:00:53,054
She's not gone.

28
00:00:53,089 --> 00:00:54,422
So where is she?

29
00:00:54,457 --> 00:00:56,457
Shades go to the Underworld.

30
00:00:56,493 --> 00:00:58,393
The living can access
the Underworld

31
00:00:58,428 --> 00:00:59,794
with the help of a Gatekeeper.

32
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:00,829
An Ancient One.

33
00:01:00,864 --> 00:01:03,431
I think I figured out
what an Ancient One is.

34
00:01:09,205 --> 00:01:11,839
Look, Q, you don't have to
come with me.

35
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:14,709
In fact,
I don't think that you should.

36
00:01:14,744 --> 00:01:17,679
Noted, but I'm coming.

37
00:01:17,714 --> 00:01:20,181
You feel the energy
coming off that?

38
00:01:20,216 --> 00:01:22,917
Yeah, also the stink.

39
00:01:25,855 --> 00:01:29,157
I don't know, my ancient Greek
is a little rusty.

40
00:01:29,192 --> 00:01:31,592
"The old reveals itself
to the new

41
00:01:31,628 --> 00:01:35,029
at the fall of milk teeth."

42
00:01:35,065 --> 00:01:37,098
Milk teeth?

43
00:01:37,133 --> 00:01:38,666
Oh, baby teeth.

44
00:01:38,702 --> 00:01:41,235
You think we have to
stick one in to open it up?

45
00:01:41,271 --> 00:01:42,704
I mean, I could write a spell.

46
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:45,273
Uh, we could find
the nearest child's house

47
00:01:45,308 --> 00:01:46,508
expecting the Tooth Fairy
and--

48
00:01:46,543 --> 00:01:49,243
Break in and steal their teeth?

49
00:01:49,279 --> 00:01:51,746
I'd leave money.

50
00:01:52,982 --> 00:01:54,949
Uh, I hate to bring this up,
but I actually--

51
00:01:54,984 --> 00:01:56,350
I still have one...

52
00:01:56,386 --> 00:01:57,719
a molar that never came in.

53
00:01:57,754 --> 00:01:59,987
Oh, I know an extraction spell.

54
00:02:00,023 --> 00:02:00,955
Ah!

55
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,824
- Fuck!
- Sorry.

56
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:08,029
This dragon better be
fucking cool.

57
00:02:15,238 --> 00:02:17,914
Hmm...

58
00:02:17,949 --> 00:02:20,116
Or not.

59
00:02:36,568 --> 00:02:38,668
I wouldn't have guessed
baby teeth.

60
00:02:38,703 --> 00:02:41,304
Why would a dragon want
baby teeth?

61
00:02:41,339 --> 00:02:44,974
- Shit.
<i>- I collect baby teeth.</i>

62
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:47,477
<i>As I collect many things,
little mammal.</i>

63
00:02:52,817 --> 00:02:55,251
Uh, greetings, your Ladyship.

64
00:02:55,286 --> 00:02:56,986
<i>"Your Ladyship"?</i>

65
00:02:57,021 --> 00:03:00,189
<i>I am a Queen of the Great Worms.</i>

66
00:03:00,225 --> 00:03:01,758
Of course you are.

67
00:03:01,793 --> 00:03:04,227
Uh, that's awesome--I wasn't
suggesting that you weren't.

68
00:03:04,262 --> 00:03:07,463
<i>Your manner does not endear
me to you, human.</i>

69
00:03:10,902 --> 00:03:14,170
We seek passage to the
Underworld, oh Ancient One.

70
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,175
<i>Hmm.
You seek to die.</i>

71
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:23,646
Uh, no, actually, we were
hoping to come back after.

72
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:25,715
<i>Suit yourself.</i>

73
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,817
I require a gift.

74
00:03:27,852 --> 00:03:30,419
A gift?
Um...

75
00:03:30,455 --> 00:03:31,888
yeah, I mean, name it,

76
00:03:31,923 --> 00:03:34,056
and we'll get it for you.

77
00:03:34,092 --> 00:03:37,193
You already have it.

78
00:03:37,228 --> 00:03:39,529
It's in your pocket.

79
00:03:47,071 --> 00:03:49,205
No.
Pick something else.

80
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,407
No, if it gets you
your Shade back--

81
00:03:51,442 --> 00:03:53,142
No.

82
00:03:53,178 --> 00:03:54,811
Fillory is your home.

83
00:03:54,846 --> 00:03:56,579
And what about your friends?
What if they need you?

84
00:03:56,614 --> 00:03:58,581
We can't.

85
00:04:00,652 --> 00:04:03,686
Queen of the Great Worms.

86
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:05,855
What if I, uh,
needed to borrow it

87
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,057
in the future,
just super briefly?

88
00:04:08,092 --> 00:04:09,325
<i>No.</i>

89
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,160
If you wish to return home,

90
00:04:11,196 --> 00:04:12,995
you must find other means.

91
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:16,699
<i>The first door remains open,
little mammal.</i>

92
00:04:16,734 --> 00:04:21,270
Great, um, I super love riddles.

93
00:04:27,111 --> 00:04:30,413
Are you giving me
the button or not?

94
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:42,892
Your bodies will stay here,
and your souls will travel.

95
00:04:42,927 --> 00:04:45,361
You have 24 hours
to return to the portal.

96
00:04:45,396 --> 00:04:46,829
Or?

97
00:04:46,865 --> 00:04:50,166
I sit patiently,
waiting for you to come back.

98
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:54,270
No, I eat you--I'm a fucking
dragon, what do you expect?

99
00:04:54,305 --> 00:04:55,671
Great, good to know.

100
00:04:55,707 --> 00:04:58,474
Then it's settled.

101
00:05:04,182 --> 00:05:06,482
Jesus,
a little warning next time.

102
00:05:06,517 --> 00:05:08,918
Really.

103
00:05:08,953 --> 00:05:12,088
Q, look.

104
00:05:12,123 --> 00:05:13,656
<i>Time to go.</i>

105
00:05:16,694 --> 00:05:18,928
Fucking millennials.

106
00:05:42,253 --> 00:05:44,787
Welcome to the Underworld.

107
00:05:46,858 --> 00:05:49,258
Please take a number.

108
00:05:54,299 --> 00:05:55,865
The fuck?

109

110
00:06:11,382 --> 00:06:13,149
Idri is almost here.

111
00:06:13,184 --> 00:06:16,419
And does anyone know
where Fen is?

112
00:06:20,892 --> 00:06:23,993
I present King Idri of Loria.

113
00:06:27,932 --> 00:06:30,399
My life is perfect.

114
00:06:30,435 --> 00:06:31,734
Hello.

115
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:33,803
Josh--wine, canapÃ©s.

116
00:06:33,838 --> 00:06:35,571
I said have it ready.

117
00:06:35,606 --> 00:06:38,407
We have a lovely blend of--

118
00:06:38,443 --> 00:06:39,575
<i>Ahem. Okay.</i>

119
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,810
And where are the fire dancers?

120
00:06:40,845 --> 00:06:43,980
I don't know.

121
00:06:44,015 --> 00:06:45,648
I'm sorry,
I had a whole thing--

122
00:06:45,683 --> 00:06:47,416
Your Majesty, this presentation

123
00:06:47,452 --> 00:06:50,252
is beautiful, but...

124
00:06:50,288 --> 00:06:52,421
It would be so much better
with fire dancers, I know.

125
00:06:52,457 --> 00:06:55,324
I hope my arrival isn't
causing undue stress.

126
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,026
Stress?

127
00:06:57,061 --> 00:07:00,029
- I'm not stressed--
- Eliot.

128
00:07:00,064 --> 00:07:03,032
- I don't care about ceremony.
- You don't?

129
00:07:03,067 --> 00:07:06,569
- But--
- But I came here for you.

130
00:07:06,604 --> 00:07:10,439
Oh.

131
00:07:10,475 --> 00:07:12,408
Well...

132
00:07:12,443 --> 00:07:15,444
the feeling's mutual.

133
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:20,449
Take me somewhere we can
become a bit better acquainted.

134
00:07:20,485 --> 00:07:22,385
Alone.

135
00:07:25,656 --> 00:07:28,124
Congratulations, you're dead.

136
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:31,827
You've passed through the veil
to the Underworld.

137
00:07:31,863 --> 00:07:33,629
<i>Is this your final destination?</i>

138
00:07:33,664 --> 00:07:35,097
<i>No.</i>

139
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:37,166
<i>It's the first leg
of your journey.</i>

140
00:07:37,201 --> 00:07:40,369
<i>We designed this part
of the Underworld for you,</i>

141
00:07:40,405 --> 00:07:42,938
<i>based on your life
and personal expectations</i>

142
00:07:42,974 --> 00:07:45,808
<i>to facilitate a comfortable
transition.</i>

143
00:07:45,843 --> 00:07:49,879
<i>You've been grouped with others
who have similar expectations.</i>

144
00:07:49,914 --> 00:07:51,147
<i>Perfect, right?</i>

145
00:07:51,182 --> 00:07:54,350
- Ow.
- What?

146
00:07:54,385 --> 00:07:57,253
<i>Settle into this
next stage of your existence.</i>

147
00:07:57,288 --> 00:07:59,688
<i>In the unlikely event
you're missing your Shade,</i>

148
00:07:59,724 --> 00:08:02,324
<i>please report to
a bellhop immediately.</i>

149
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,393
<i>Enjoy your wait.</i>

150
00:08:07,965 --> 00:08:09,398
I guess we need to
find a bellhop.

151
00:08:09,434 --> 00:08:11,300
<i>Security,
we have a Shade-less patron!</i>

152
00:08:11,335 --> 00:08:12,701
<i>What?
Hey!</i>

153
00:08:12,737 --> 00:08:14,070
- Take him away.
- Why? Where are you taking me?

154
00:08:14,105 --> 00:08:16,439
- Thank you, thank you.
- Read me my rights!

155
00:08:16,474 --> 00:08:18,607
Hey, let go!
Wait, ow!

156
00:08:18,643 --> 00:08:21,343
Or, you know, we take a beat.

157
00:08:21,379 --> 00:08:23,045
173.

158
00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:26,315
I'm 173.

159
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,716
Place your hands on the counter

160
00:08:27,752 --> 00:08:30,186
for identification, please.

161
00:08:33,324 --> 00:08:36,092
Hey, do you know where they
were taking that guy just now?

162
00:08:36,127 --> 00:08:39,795
Oh, his soul is missing
a little piece.

163
00:08:39,831 --> 00:08:41,097
They just took him
somewhere where

164
00:08:41,132 --> 00:08:42,898
he would be more comfortable.

165
00:08:42,934 --> 00:08:44,300
So he could be reunited with it?

166
00:08:44,335 --> 00:08:46,168
I doubt it, that's very
difficult to do.

167
00:08:46,204 --> 00:08:48,637
Especially after
a prolonged separation.

168
00:08:48,673 --> 00:08:49,905
Yeah,
but you can't just take--

169
00:08:49,941 --> 00:08:51,373
I assure you, all the Shades

170
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:54,743
are safe and well protected
for their eternity.

171
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:56,779
Nothing to worry over.

172
00:08:56,814 --> 00:08:57,980
Ah, here we are.

173
00:08:58,015 --> 00:09:01,083
Wicker and Coldwater.

174
00:09:01,119 --> 00:09:02,718
Oh.

175
00:09:02,753 --> 00:09:04,120
Oh, my.

176
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:11,994
- What?
- You've both died 39 times.

177
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:14,797
Aha--time loop.
Thought so.

178
00:09:14,832 --> 00:09:17,533
Our computers do not
handle these well.

179
00:09:17,568 --> 00:09:20,202
This will take a bit
to sort out.

180
00:09:20,238 --> 00:09:22,171
Once you're in the system,
we'll reunite you

181
00:09:22,206 --> 00:09:23,572
with your immediate
karmic circle,

182
00:09:23,608 --> 00:09:25,741
but until then, I'll need to
stick you somewhere.

183
00:09:25,776 --> 00:09:27,176
Do you like skiing?

184
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:29,111
Look, I thought
this was just a waystation.

185
00:09:29,147 --> 00:09:31,480
- We're kind of in a hurry--
- Oh, it is.

186
00:09:31,516 --> 00:09:34,016
But souls do stay a while,

187
00:09:34,051 --> 00:09:36,685
until they're ready to...

188
00:09:36,721 --> 00:09:38,120
move on.

189
00:09:38,156 --> 00:09:40,189
Snorkeling?
Art museums?

190
00:09:40,224 --> 00:09:43,092
Actually, is it possible
to check on a few names?

191
00:09:43,127 --> 00:09:46,262
I think I might have
a karmic circle we could visit.

192
00:09:55,573 --> 00:09:56,872
You're making progress.

193
00:09:56,908 --> 00:09:58,073
Am I?

194
00:09:58,109 --> 00:10:00,209
Nothing's happening.

195
00:10:00,244 --> 00:10:02,845
It's an exceedingly
difficult way to do magic.

196
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,148
Trying to isolate muscles not
generally associated with--

197
00:10:06,184 --> 00:10:08,284
Call it what it is.

198
00:10:08,319 --> 00:10:09,919
Sphincter magic.

199
00:10:09,954 --> 00:10:11,620
Gets me there, no shame.

200
00:10:11,656 --> 00:10:12,888
And if it doesn't,

201
00:10:12,924 --> 00:10:15,090
we all need
a healthy pelvic floor.

202
00:10:15,126 --> 00:10:16,959
Now, I'm afraid
study time is over.

203
00:10:16,994 --> 00:10:18,894
I have your next job.

204
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:21,697
- Re-shelving books.
- Great.

205
00:10:21,732 --> 00:10:23,966
Any questions,
direct them to--

206
00:10:24,001 --> 00:10:25,301
where'd she go?

207
00:10:25,336 --> 00:10:26,902
- Sylvia!
<i>- What?</i>

208
00:10:26,938 --> 00:10:28,437
Shh!

209
00:10:32,743 --> 00:10:36,412
Penny, Sylvia.
Sylvia, Penny.

210
00:10:36,447 --> 00:10:38,414
So what, I'm babysitting now?

211
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:39,582
Oh, no.

212
00:10:39,617 --> 00:10:41,050
Sylvia is your supervisor.

213
00:10:41,085 --> 00:10:43,385
Good luck, I'll check back.

214
00:10:46,591 --> 00:10:48,524
Nice scarf.

215
00:10:50,595 --> 00:10:54,863
Anyway, I married Fen
because I had to.

216
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:58,367
But I didn't know her at all.

217
00:10:58,402 --> 00:11:00,869
And now...

218
00:11:00,905 --> 00:11:03,973
I don't know you.

219
00:11:04,008 --> 00:11:05,774
My wife used to say,
there's one way

220
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,712
to learn to be with
another person.

221
00:11:09,747 --> 00:11:11,747
The hard way?

222
00:11:11,782 --> 00:11:14,617
Actually, yes.

223
00:11:14,652 --> 00:11:16,185
Stand up.

224
00:11:21,692 --> 00:11:24,460
Would you mind removing this?

225
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:34,270
Buttons, too, please.

226
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,675
- What are you doing?
- Shh.

227
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:43,078
This is a lesson.

228
00:11:43,114 --> 00:11:46,548
All of them.

229
00:11:46,584 --> 00:11:47,850
Please.

230
00:11:51,989 --> 00:11:53,822
I really hate to bring this up,

231
00:11:53,858 --> 00:11:57,760
but you do realize there's
nothing we can actually do.

232
00:11:57,795 --> 00:11:59,495
Oh, I know.

233
00:12:01,365 --> 00:12:03,599
And yet,
there's so much we can do.

234
00:12:05,636 --> 00:12:08,003
I can't touch you,

235
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:10,439
you can't touch me,

236
00:12:10,474 --> 00:12:14,009
but I can tell you
how I want to touch you.

237
00:12:14,045 --> 00:12:18,080
And you can show me
how you like to be touched.

238
00:12:18,115 --> 00:12:21,083
I admire your
commitment to education.

239
00:12:22,787 --> 00:12:26,155
If you're waiting for
my permission, don't.

240
00:12:37,101 --> 00:12:39,234
What the fuck?

241
00:12:40,738 --> 00:12:43,105
Eliot, Heloise just
turned into a rat!

242
00:12:45,142 --> 00:12:46,308
Who is that?

243
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:50,964
I'm not getting laid
tonight, am I?

244
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:54,977
- This is all of them?
- We can't be sure.

245
00:12:55,332 --> 00:12:56,474
So many people have vanished

246
00:12:56,505 --> 00:12:58,573
and there are so many rats
in the castle already.

247
00:12:58,693 --> 00:13:01,427
Well, one of 'em has to be Fen.

248
00:13:01,496 --> 00:13:03,763
Okay, bottom line it for me.

249
00:13:03,831 --> 00:13:04,964
What the fuck is going on?

250
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:06,399
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

251
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:08,501
But this magic,
I've never seen it before.

252
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,971
Abigail?
If you can hear me, squeak.

253
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,673
Let me know you're okay.

254
00:13:13,741 --> 00:13:17,610
Why didn't I study
how to speak rat in school?

255
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,880
Okay, search the castle.

256
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:21,949
Find every rat.

257
00:13:21,983 --> 00:13:23,583
And then Council meeting.

258
00:13:23,651 --> 00:13:26,419
Or what's left of the Council.

259
00:13:46,941 --> 00:13:48,174
What do we call that?

260
00:13:48,242 --> 00:13:49,942
Mm...

261
00:13:50,011 --> 00:13:52,878
In-sex-tion?

262
00:13:52,947 --> 00:13:55,381
Inter-cepti-course?

263
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:58,618
Incepti-sex.

264
00:13:58,686 --> 00:14:00,753
"Incepti-sex."

265
00:14:00,822 --> 00:14:02,922
I like that.

266
00:14:02,991 --> 00:14:06,058
That said,
I like real life better.

267
00:14:06,127 --> 00:14:08,160
Mm.

268
00:14:08,229 --> 00:14:12,031
But at least this way, we
don't have to get up for beers.

269
00:14:15,937 --> 00:14:17,703
Thank you.

270
00:14:21,643 --> 00:14:24,744
So, no pressure,

271
00:14:24,812 --> 00:14:27,179
but...

272
00:14:27,248 --> 00:14:28,547
any word on the Poison Room?

273
00:14:28,616 --> 00:14:30,082
Believe me,
I want to get in there.

274
00:14:30,151 --> 00:14:31,851
It's--it's above my pay grade.

275
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:33,686
I need a code to get in.

276
00:14:33,755 --> 00:14:35,454
Well, what about that librarian?

277
00:14:35,523 --> 00:14:36,956
Oh, man, if she has the code,

278
00:14:37,025 --> 00:14:39,025
it is locked down tighter
than a nun's pussy.

279
00:14:39,093 --> 00:14:40,993
Right, of course it is.

280
00:14:41,062 --> 00:14:44,864
Hey, does she have
a book of her?

281
00:14:44,932 --> 00:14:47,833
Everyone has a book.

282
00:14:47,902 --> 00:14:48,734
You're thinking...

283
00:14:48,803 --> 00:14:51,504
If the room
is that important--

284
00:14:51,572 --> 00:14:54,006
It's in her book.

285
00:14:54,075 --> 00:14:55,341
Okay.

286
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,410
I can work on that.

287
00:14:57,478 --> 00:14:59,545
Hey, what's up with the Senator?

288
00:14:59,614 --> 00:15:00,946
He went back to work.

289
00:15:01,015 --> 00:15:02,381
He made up some bullshit excuse

290
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,616
about the kidnapping.

291
00:15:03,685 --> 00:15:05,851
All the news outlets bought it.

292
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,453
But hey, get this--

293
00:15:07,522 --> 00:15:10,156
I saw Reynard in the back of
a press photo.

294
00:15:10,224 --> 00:15:12,758
In a suit,
like an advisor or something.

295
00:15:12,827 --> 00:15:14,794
Are you kidding me?

296
00:15:14,862 --> 00:15:17,063
He's a trickster.

297
00:15:17,131 --> 00:15:18,831
Guess that includes his own son.

298
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,166
Jesus Christ.

299
00:15:21,736 --> 00:15:23,436
We can't get one more vote?

300
00:15:23,504 --> 00:15:25,344
We're in touch with
Matthews, Bauer, Wheeler.

301
00:15:25,406 --> 00:15:28,040
Just give 'em a couple of days,
they'll come to their senses.

302
00:15:28,109 --> 00:15:29,442
Call in Senator Cowden.

303
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,210
Why bother?
He won't budge.

304
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,646
We can change his mind.
Trust me.

305
00:15:33,715 --> 00:15:35,648
How?

306
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:37,917
Everyone, give us a minute.

307
00:15:43,391 --> 00:15:46,358
So they're taking
your orders now?

308
00:15:46,427 --> 00:15:47,593
Have been for a while.

309
00:15:47,662 --> 00:15:49,695
I controlled their minds.

310
00:15:49,764 --> 00:15:52,665
Just like you have,
many, many times.

311
00:15:52,734 --> 00:15:54,366
I don't know what
you're talking about.

312
00:15:54,435 --> 00:15:56,402
You know you have that power.

313
00:15:56,471 --> 00:15:58,871
You've been using it
your whole life.

314
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:02,441
I always thought
I had some kind of...

315
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:05,845
god-level good luck.

316
00:16:05,913 --> 00:16:08,881
True, you've only used it
instinctively,

317
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,483
but I'm here now.

318
00:16:10,551 --> 00:16:12,685
I can teach you
how to use it at will.

319
00:16:12,754 --> 00:16:14,286
Easy.

320
00:16:14,355 --> 00:16:16,422
And once you've mastered it,

321
00:16:16,491 --> 00:16:18,924
that's how you get
Cowden's vote.

322
00:16:18,993 --> 00:16:20,526
I don't know that
I want to do that.

323
00:16:20,595 --> 00:16:23,462
- It feels like cheating.
- They all don't cheat?

324
00:16:23,531 --> 00:16:25,598
Everyone uses whatever
they've got, John,

325
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:27,900
and the bad ones don't hesitate.

326
00:16:27,969 --> 00:16:29,201
So someone like you,

327
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,137
someone who wants to do some

328
00:16:31,205 --> 00:16:33,205
actual good in the world,

329
00:16:33,274 --> 00:16:36,275
how can you not?

330
00:16:36,344 --> 00:16:38,344
Here's all you have to do.

331
00:16:38,412 --> 00:16:40,479
Look at me.

332
00:16:43,217 --> 00:16:45,284
You look him
straight in the eye,

333
00:16:45,353 --> 00:16:48,087
and you tell him, plainly.

334
00:16:48,156 --> 00:16:50,389
Directly.

335
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,658
That's it?

336
00:16:52,727 --> 00:16:55,861
It's that simple.

337
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,730
Good luck with the meeting,
Senator.

338
00:17:10,444 --> 00:17:11,884
Why would anyone
want their afterlife

339
00:17:11,913 --> 00:17:14,480
to look like a terrible
middle school birthday party?

340
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:16,148
Is this about your "incident"?

341
00:17:16,217 --> 00:17:18,117
- I moved on.
- Have you?

342
00:17:18,186 --> 00:17:19,585
- Julia?
- Julia!

343
00:17:19,654 --> 00:17:21,787
- Julia!
- Oh, welcome!

344
00:17:21,856 --> 00:17:23,823
Welcome!

345
00:17:23,891 --> 00:17:25,491
Where's Bender?
Is he okay?

346
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,992
He's great.
He moved on.

347
00:17:27,061 --> 00:17:29,829
Uh, who's your friend,
and what's his shoe size?

348
00:17:29,897 --> 00:17:31,897
Uh, we're not really
here to bowl.

349
00:17:31,966 --> 00:17:33,766
Kid, the first rule
of being dead,

350
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:35,835
if you're here, ya bowl.

351
00:17:35,903 --> 00:17:37,469
We're actually not dead, either.

352
00:17:37,538 --> 00:17:38,938
Uh, we're here because
we need your help.

353
00:17:39,006 --> 00:17:40,706
<i>Julia?</i>

354
00:17:47,782 --> 00:17:50,149
What?

355
00:17:50,218 --> 00:17:51,483
Nothing.

356
00:17:51,552 --> 00:17:53,519
It's--it's good to see you,
Richard.

357
00:17:53,588 --> 00:17:56,021
- I mean, the real you.
- The real me?

358
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:58,257
What happened?

359
00:17:58,326 --> 00:17:59,458
I need your help.

360
00:17:59,527 --> 00:18:01,694
I need to find my Shade.

361
00:18:01,762 --> 00:18:03,295
Okay.

362
00:18:04,354 --> 00:18:06,860
The underworld is massive.
There's every ecosystem.

363
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,224
Nearest we can tell,
about 2,000 islands

364
00:18:09,503 --> 00:18:11,203
built to look like Hawaii.

365
00:18:11,271 --> 00:18:12,504
And you went with
a bowling alley?

366
00:18:12,573 --> 00:18:13,573
Fuck yeah.

367
00:18:13,607 --> 00:18:14,806
And the powers that be

368
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,175
are into whatever
helps us settle in

369
00:18:17,244 --> 00:18:18,777
so that we can move on.

370
00:18:18,846 --> 00:18:20,779
Ow, yeah!
Whoo!

371
00:18:20,848 --> 00:18:23,248
- "Powers that be"?
- Yeah. Gods.

372
00:18:23,317 --> 00:18:24,816
We were right about
them being real.

373
00:18:24,885 --> 00:18:26,485
Hades created the Underworld,

374
00:18:26,553 --> 00:18:27,953
runs it with his wife,
Persephone.

375
00:18:28,021 --> 00:18:30,689
They live in a big house
way over here.

376
00:18:30,757 --> 00:18:33,091
It's a beautiful area
called Elysium.

377
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,494
Apparently, they used to
come and go like clockwork

378
00:18:35,562 --> 00:18:38,096
every fall and spring,
but a while back,

379
00:18:38,165 --> 00:18:39,431
they just disappeared.

380
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,501
Wait, why are you
doing all this, Richard?

381
00:18:42,569 --> 00:18:44,836
I know you.
This is a project.

382
00:18:44,905 --> 00:18:46,771
I'm trying to find my son.

383
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,441
I don't know where he is,
if he's even still here.

384
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,976
But he's got to be somewhere.

385
00:18:51,044 --> 00:18:53,912
And they won't tell me
a damn thing.

386
00:18:53,981 --> 00:18:56,014
Why not?

387
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:59,351
I'm flagged as culpable
in his death.

388
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:00,819
There are rules.

389
00:19:00,888 --> 00:19:03,188
And friends to help me
break them.

390
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:07,292
Okay, so wait, so where
do they keep the Shades?

391
00:19:07,361 --> 00:19:08,727
Sorry, we don't know that yet.

392
00:19:08,795 --> 00:19:09,995
So we're flying blind?

393
00:19:10,063 --> 00:19:12,297
Hun, you're gonna have to bowl.

394
00:19:12,366 --> 00:19:14,232
No, look, I had an incident
when I was a kid.

395
00:19:14,301 --> 00:19:16,268
- My fingers got stuck in the--
- Oh, get over it.

396
00:19:16,336 --> 00:19:17,636
Your girl would.

397
00:19:17,704 --> 00:19:19,671
- She's not my girl.
- No shit.

398
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,339
She's tough as granite.

399
00:19:21,408 --> 00:19:23,475
And you're afraid to bowl.

400
00:19:23,544 --> 00:19:24,576
Fine.

401
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:33,385
How long before the dragon
eats you and Quentin?

402
00:19:33,453 --> 00:19:35,086
Tomorrow morning.

403
00:19:35,155 --> 00:19:36,621
Always the one
to tell the impossible

404
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:37,889
to go fuck itself, huh?

405
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:41,426
Yeah, well,
it doesn't always listen.

406
00:19:41,495 --> 00:19:43,695
They'll know where the Shades
are kept at reception.

407
00:19:43,764 --> 00:19:45,897
I don't know,
they didn't seem too keen

408
00:19:45,966 --> 00:19:48,567
on helping out a person
who looked like this.

409
00:19:49,469 --> 00:19:51,536
Shit, it seems to be closing up

410
00:19:51,605 --> 00:19:53,672
much faster down here.

411
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,173
Okay, so we hurry.

412
00:19:55,242 --> 00:19:57,142
But just--not for nothing,
reception isn't keen

413
00:19:57,211 --> 00:19:59,678
to help much of anyone--I can't
count the number of times

414
00:19:59,746 --> 00:20:04,015
I've been kicked out of there,
trying to find my little boy.

415
00:20:04,084 --> 00:20:06,751
- I have an idea.
- Oh, my God, Julia!

416
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,954
I--I got a strike.

417
00:20:09,022 --> 00:20:09,921
Whoo!

418
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,423
Yeah, Q!

419
00:20:11,491 --> 00:20:13,692
The thing about the
Underworld is, the first week,

420
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,627
it's always a strike.

421
00:20:18,165 --> 00:20:20,498
Let him have this one.

422
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:22,367
Whoo!
Go, Q!

423
00:20:22,436 --> 00:20:23,602
Ow!

424
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:33,345
- You wanted to talk?
- You lying son of a bitch.

425
00:20:33,413 --> 00:20:37,349
You turned Fen into a rat,
along with half the castle.

426
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:39,284
Fen is in her human form,

427
00:20:39,353 --> 00:20:40,952
in the Fairy Realm.

428
00:20:41,021 --> 00:20:42,520
And she was taken
because you tried to

429
00:20:42,589 --> 00:20:43,888
get clever with our deal.

430
00:20:43,957 --> 00:20:47,125
So you turned half my staff
into snake food?

431
00:20:47,194 --> 00:20:49,327
- That wasn't the fairies.
- Oh.

432
00:20:49,396 --> 00:20:53,031
Well, it sure smells like
their whimsical bullshit.

433
00:20:54,234 --> 00:20:56,201
"Whimsical."

434
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:58,103
It's the mark of the stupid
and the arrogant

435
00:20:58,171 --> 00:21:00,338
to attack what you can't
comprehend.

436
00:21:00,407 --> 00:21:01,973
Fine.

437
00:21:02,042 --> 00:21:03,775
Get it out of your system.

438
00:21:03,844 --> 00:21:06,144
Then if you know
what's going on,

439
00:21:06,213 --> 00:21:08,213
just tell me.

440
00:21:08,282 --> 00:21:09,981
I take it back.

441
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:13,385
You're not entirely
simple-minded.

442
00:21:13,453 --> 00:21:14,753
There's another power,

443
00:21:14,821 --> 00:21:16,821
which you made the mistake
of overlooking.

444
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,890
You want to be specific, or not?

445
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:20,925
A power without logic.

446
00:21:20,994 --> 00:21:25,330
A power that acts, not for gain,
but solely because it can.

447
00:21:25,399 --> 00:21:27,999
That's the true danger.

448
00:21:28,068 --> 00:21:29,534
Face that.

449
00:21:29,603 --> 00:21:32,203
Or face the end of your kingdom.

450
00:21:41,615 --> 00:21:43,281
Uh, hey.

451
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:46,484
- I got a question for you.
- Of course.

452
00:21:46,553 --> 00:21:48,286
How can I help?

453
00:21:48,355 --> 00:21:51,890
You know, I never got your name.

454
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:54,759
You may call me Head Librarian.

455
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,729
And, uh...

456
00:21:57,798 --> 00:22:00,665
what do I get to call you
outside of work?

457
00:22:00,734 --> 00:22:02,767
I see what you're getting at.

458
00:22:02,836 --> 00:22:05,637
But interoffice courtship
is expressly prohibited.

459
00:22:05,706 --> 00:22:08,106
I'm flattered,
but rules are rule.

460
00:22:08,175 --> 00:22:09,741
Are they?

461
00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:12,877
Always?

462
00:22:12,946 --> 00:22:15,647
Penny, please don't
take it personally,

463
00:22:15,716 --> 00:22:18,283
but you're not my type.

464
00:22:18,352 --> 00:22:20,785
You're a touch
emotionally insecure,

465
00:22:20,854 --> 00:22:23,688
for which you compensate heavily
with boisterousness

466
00:22:23,757 --> 00:22:26,157
and foul language.

467
00:22:26,226 --> 00:22:28,326
I'm here if you need
anything else.

468
00:22:41,808 --> 00:22:44,008
- Hey, guys.
- Mr. Corrigan.

469
00:22:44,077 --> 00:22:45,877
Uh, Mr. Corrigan, you have
no need to be in here.

470
00:22:45,946 --> 00:22:47,178
Just a couple of questions.

471
00:22:47,247 --> 00:22:49,080
- I'm gonna take a number.
- Please, sir.

472
00:22:49,149 --> 00:22:51,182
Um, you know what, I'm gonna
take a couple of numbers,

473
00:22:51,251 --> 00:22:53,351
just in case I don't--
I don't hear the first number.

474
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,020
<i>Yeah, wow, you guys got
a lot of numbers.</i>

475
00:22:55,088 --> 00:22:56,454
Mr. Corrigan,
I beseech you.

476
00:22:56,523 --> 00:22:58,323
Oh, no, does this thing
run out of numbers?

477
00:22:58,392 --> 00:23:00,232
- There we go.
- Playtime's over, Mr. Corrigan.

478
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,960
<i>I'm not playing,
I really have questions.</i>

479
00:23:02,028 --> 00:23:03,428
<i>Quite the jokester you are.
That is it.</i>

480
00:23:03,497 --> 00:23:05,964
- Security!
- Don't call security, Thomas.

481
00:23:06,032 --> 00:23:07,799
- Security!
- Oh, no, security.

482
00:23:07,868 --> 00:23:09,467
<i>- They're on their way.
- No, no, no.</i>

483
00:23:09,536 --> 00:23:11,403
<i>I'm just getting a number here.
Ha ha, very funny.</i>

484
00:23:11,471 --> 00:23:13,605
<i>Does this thing
run out of numbers?</i>

485
00:23:13,673 --> 00:23:15,440
It's locked.

486
00:23:15,509 --> 00:23:18,510
<i>Security!</i>

487
00:23:18,578 --> 00:23:20,378
- "Disconnected Shade."
- Where?

488
00:23:20,447 --> 00:23:21,513
It doesn't say.

489
00:23:21,581 --> 00:23:23,247
Just says "E."

490
00:23:25,118 --> 00:23:27,051
Another one,
"disconnected Shade, 'E.'"

491
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,288
Wait, if they all say "E"...

492
00:23:30,357 --> 00:23:32,123
- Elysium.
- Yes.

493
00:23:32,192 --> 00:23:35,226
Okay, great, it's the complete
opposite end of the Underworld.

494
00:23:35,295 --> 00:23:37,862
Take him away for
disciplinary processing.

495
00:23:37,931 --> 00:23:39,464
- Thank you.
- There's no need, guys.

496
00:23:39,533 --> 00:23:41,065
Okay, you got me.

497
00:23:41,134 --> 00:23:44,702
Hope you had some fun to make
your confinement worthwhile.

498
00:23:44,771 --> 00:23:46,838
Oh, what's a few weeks
out of eternity?

499
00:23:54,815 --> 00:23:57,415
This is books for school kids.

500
00:23:57,484 --> 00:23:58,416
If it's so important,

501
00:23:58,485 --> 00:24:01,119
finding me that five mil
can't be too hard.

502
00:24:01,188 --> 00:24:02,854
I'm not adding
another amendment.

503
00:24:02,923 --> 00:24:05,056
You invited me in.

504
00:24:05,125 --> 00:24:07,559
You knew what you were
getting into.

505
00:24:07,627 --> 00:24:09,527
Right.

506
00:24:18,405 --> 00:24:20,972
You're going to support
this bill.

507
00:24:21,041 --> 00:24:24,476
In fact, your yes will be
the first vote cast.

508
00:24:28,215 --> 00:24:31,449
John, this bill should've
been passed a long time ago.

509
00:24:31,518 --> 00:24:34,853
And I'm sorry for trying to
drag you into the ditch on this.

510
00:24:34,921 --> 00:24:37,622
You have my vote.

511
00:24:37,691 --> 00:24:40,024
Then I thank you for your help.

512
00:24:41,828 --> 00:24:43,194
You all right?

513
00:24:46,466 --> 00:24:48,132
Let me get you some water.

514
00:24:48,201 --> 00:24:51,236
I--I must've
stood up too fast.

515
00:24:51,304 --> 00:24:54,105
Here you go.

516
00:24:54,174 --> 00:24:55,740
I--I need to make a--

517
00:24:55,809 --> 00:24:57,108
Becca!

518
00:24:57,177 --> 00:24:59,985
Becca, get the doctor.
Get the doctor now!

519
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:04,900
John, I'm sorry but

520
00:25:05,207 --> 00:25:07,169
I think you're overestimating
yourself, here.

521
00:25:07,238 --> 00:25:10,472
No, honey,
I'm being 100% literal.

522
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:12,308
I am not human, Cindy.

523
00:25:12,376 --> 00:25:14,877
And I know it sounds ridiculous,
but it is true.

524
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:16,111
Okay...

525
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,314
I think that you have
been working too hard--

526
00:25:18,382 --> 00:25:19,382
No, I haven't.

527
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,707
I haven't.

528
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,053
I am telling you the truth.

529
00:25:24,121 --> 00:25:25,487
Because you are the one I trust.

530
00:25:25,556 --> 00:25:28,691
You are the only one, really.

531
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:32,394
And I really just need
your support right now, babe.

532
00:25:34,298 --> 00:25:36,799
Of course, honey.

533
00:25:36,867 --> 00:25:39,602
I apologize.

534
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:42,438
I know that you always find
a way to do the right thing,

535
00:25:42,506 --> 00:25:44,273
and I am here for you.

536
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:46,008
Whatever you need.

537
00:25:50,014 --> 00:25:51,413
Now come on.

538
00:25:51,482 --> 00:25:53,148
Let's go home.

539
00:26:21,545 --> 00:26:23,312
It's like a Shade orphanage.

540
00:26:23,381 --> 00:26:24,446
We should hurry.

541
00:26:24,515 --> 00:26:25,481
We're running out of time.

542
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:27,116
We should split up.

543
00:26:27,184 --> 00:26:29,285
I kind of have a thing about
splitting up in houses

544
00:26:29,353 --> 00:26:30,986
full of creepy kids.

545
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:42,231
Hey, can we ask you a question?

546
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,400
- Sure.
- What was that?

547
00:26:44,468 --> 00:26:46,068
That you just did
with the money?

548
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:48,470
For the little boy?

549
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:49,638
What little boy?

550
00:26:49,707 --> 00:26:51,907
The little boy
with the shitty dad.

551
00:26:51,976 --> 00:26:52,976
He ran away.

552
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:54,610
And now he's cold and hungry.

553
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:56,945
He'll find it on the sidewalk
any minute.

554
00:26:58,949 --> 00:27:01,183
And that...

555
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:02,951
She's in a hospital room.

556
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,320
She's making them bloom.

557
00:27:04,388 --> 00:27:07,423
It's a really obvious miracle,
but that's okay.

558
00:27:07,491 --> 00:27:09,658
The girl in the room
is gonna die anyways.

559
00:27:09,727 --> 00:27:11,560
So you're all making miracles.

560
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:13,962
Just little tiny ones, though.

561
00:27:14,031 --> 00:27:15,331
Cool.

562
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:18,067
Um, we were looking for a Shade.

563
00:27:18,135 --> 00:27:22,404
- Her name's Julia.
- Yeah, uh, she looks like her.

564
00:27:22,473 --> 00:27:24,239
Kind of.
Um, and--

565
00:27:24,308 --> 00:27:25,974
Well, she's a--
she's a mess.

566
00:27:26,043 --> 00:27:28,510
We all were when we got here.

567
00:27:28,579 --> 00:27:29,678
Anything else?

568
00:27:29,747 --> 00:27:31,780
Um, she's brave.

569
00:27:31,849 --> 00:27:34,450
And funny,
and she probably made friends

570
00:27:34,518 --> 00:27:37,119
with some of the most shy,
maladjusted Shades.

571
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:40,656
She's curious, and she won't
take no for an answer.

572
00:27:41,859 --> 00:27:44,426
Are you looking for
the kind of new one,

573
00:27:44,495 --> 00:27:47,062
who's always getting in trouble
and sneaking into

574
00:27:47,131 --> 00:27:48,931
Ms. Persephone's room--
because, you know,

575
00:27:48,999 --> 00:27:50,866
we're never supposed to
go in there.

576
00:27:51,902 --> 00:27:54,970
Yeah.
Yeah, that does sound like her.

577
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,673
I just saw her.
This way.

578
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:02,411
Up those stairs.

579
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,279
Last door.

580
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,484
- Eugene?
- Yeah?

581
00:28:08,552 --> 00:28:10,185
Who's that?

582
00:28:10,254 --> 00:28:11,553
That's Ms. Persephone.

583
00:28:11,622 --> 00:28:13,722
She hasn't been here
for a really long time

584
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:15,391
and no one knows where she is.

585
00:28:17,795 --> 00:28:20,129
Thank you so much
for all your help.

586
00:28:24,735 --> 00:28:27,936
That's Our Lady Underground.

587
00:28:28,005 --> 00:28:29,338
What?

588
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:31,306
The one that you...

589
00:28:38,382 --> 00:28:41,750
So you were real all along, huh?

590
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:44,219
Just completely AWOL.

591
00:28:44,288 --> 00:28:46,855
Self-centered bitch.

592
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:53,262
We were so stupid to love you.

593
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:54,997
<i>Jules...</i>

594
00:28:55,065 --> 00:28:57,366
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

595
00:28:57,435 --> 00:29:01,069
Look, I'm glad I know.

596
00:29:01,138 --> 00:29:03,172
It's always better to know, Q.

597
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,840
You keep watch.

598
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,408
I'll sneak in
and find the part of me

599
00:29:06,477 --> 00:29:08,043
that already snuck in.

600
00:29:08,112 --> 00:29:09,945
Hmm.

601
00:29:15,352 --> 00:29:17,085
We're under attack.

602
00:29:17,154 --> 00:29:20,823
The Rattening, now reports of
upside down rain.

603
00:29:20,891 --> 00:29:23,826
Correct--as well as ant hills
turning into volcanoes,

604
00:29:23,894 --> 00:29:26,462
the Balmy Sea turning to acid,

605
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:29,631
and the mysterious disappearance
of all blondes

606
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,366
in the province of
Crickety Cove.

607
00:29:31,435 --> 00:29:34,970
The talking animals report
this includes palomino horses.

608
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,806
Also, every chicken in Fillory
has laryngitis.

609
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:41,276
Is there a pattern
to any of this?

610
00:29:41,345 --> 00:29:42,678
None that we can tell.

611
00:29:42,746 --> 00:29:44,913
Only that whatever it is,
it is increasing.

612
00:29:44,982 --> 00:29:47,883
Idri's turned into a rat,
so it isn't the Lorians.

613
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,452
We've incapacitated
the FU Fighters.

614
00:29:50,521 --> 00:29:52,254
That leaves...

615
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:54,156
the people in this room.

616
00:29:57,194 --> 00:29:58,727
Your Highness?

617
00:29:58,796 --> 00:30:00,762
If anyone has anything to say...

618
00:30:00,831 --> 00:30:02,731
I'm embezzling funds
from the royal treasury.

619
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,600
- Why did I just say that?
- Hah!

620
00:30:04,668 --> 00:30:07,803
Because there's truth serum
in this wine.

621
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:11,707
I've truthied you.
Anyone else?

622
00:30:11,775 --> 00:30:14,676
Abigail and I have been using
the castle guards

623
00:30:14,745 --> 00:30:16,245
to run an escort service.

624
00:30:16,313 --> 00:30:17,946
Gross.

625
00:30:18,015 --> 00:30:19,381
But clever.

626
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,550
Doesn't help us.

627
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:23,185
Should've made this stronger.

628
00:30:26,123 --> 00:30:27,556
It was me.

629
00:30:33,163 --> 00:30:35,998
I made a deal with the fairies
and I know where Fen is.

630
00:30:41,672 --> 00:30:45,007
You got to be kidding me.

631
00:30:45,075 --> 00:30:47,042
It's not your break.

632
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:53,282
So what?
You, uh--you gonna report me?

633
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:55,951
Answer a question,
maybe I'll forget to.

634
00:30:57,988 --> 00:30:59,154
What's your question?

635
00:30:59,223 --> 00:31:01,023
You trying to fuck
that librarian?

636
00:31:01,091 --> 00:31:01,957
No!

637
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,825
I saw you.
You want to fuck her.

638
00:31:03,894 --> 00:31:05,327
You want to
lick her butthole, huh?

639
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:06,795
Whoa, Jesus, no!

640
00:31:06,864 --> 00:31:08,764
Then why are you
scamming her so hard

641
00:31:08,832 --> 00:31:11,633
that I nearly blew you?

642
00:31:11,702 --> 00:31:13,135
I just need her name, okay?

643
00:31:13,203 --> 00:31:15,003
Oh, why didn't you ask?
Here.

644
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:20,475
The "S" stands for Shot,
or maybe it's Schiff.

645
00:31:20,544 --> 00:31:22,177
Let me know if you find
anything gross in her book.

646
00:31:22,246 --> 00:31:24,212
I have a feeling she's a total
freak in the sack.

647
00:31:24,281 --> 00:31:25,480
Okay.

648
00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:26,848
What's your deal?

649
00:31:26,917 --> 00:31:29,618
- I have no deal.
- You're a child.

650
00:31:29,687 --> 00:31:30,953
Okay, Grandpa,
that's a little--

651
00:31:31,021 --> 00:31:35,557
What are you even
doing stuck here?

652
00:31:35,626 --> 00:31:38,093
What do they have on you?

653
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:40,862
Nothing.

654
00:31:40,931 --> 00:31:42,397
Okay, fine,
they're protecting me.

655
00:31:42,466 --> 00:31:45,300
Protecting you from what?

656
00:31:45,369 --> 00:31:48,070
My dad is a businessman

657
00:31:48,138 --> 00:31:50,539
and sometimes his competition
can get a little rough,

658
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:51,940
so he sent me here.

659
00:31:52,009 --> 00:31:54,843
- Like, he's a--
- Legitimate businessman.

660
00:31:54,912 --> 00:31:56,311
Can we please not talk about it?

661
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,914
My God, you're like
that whiny little kid

662
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:01,450
in "The Sopranos," Willow.

663
00:32:01,518 --> 00:32:03,352
Jesus Christ, you are so lame.

664
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,953
Please.

665
00:32:06,423 --> 00:32:08,357
And her name was Meadow.

666
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:15,464
You truthied me?

667
00:32:15,532 --> 00:32:17,399
I can't lie.

668
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:19,701
Eliot, I did this for you.

669
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:22,270
- There was no other way.
- Don't.

670
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:26,742
You started this
when you declared war.

671
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:29,678
Now my wife and child are gone.

672
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:31,113
I need to deal with the rats.

673
00:32:31,181 --> 00:32:34,983
I can't risk having to
clean up your next mess.

674
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:41,356
Guards.

675
00:32:41,425 --> 00:32:43,058
No, Eliot.

676
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:46,762
- What are you doing?
- I don't know what else to do.

677
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:50,198
- Take her to the dungeon.
- No!

678
00:32:50,267 --> 00:32:52,868
Eliot...

679
00:32:52,936 --> 00:32:54,903
I'll fix this.

680
00:32:56,907 --> 00:32:59,975
Make sure she gets
the best room.

681
00:33:00,044 --> 00:33:02,611
And see that she gets
her coconut oil.

682
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,780
Good-bye, Margo.

683
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:16,024
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

684
00:33:38,749 --> 00:33:41,183
I know you're in there.

685
00:33:41,251 --> 00:33:42,718
Come out.

686
00:33:42,786 --> 00:33:44,653
It's okay.

687
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:46,221
It's me.

688
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:52,761
Oh, my God.

689
00:33:54,492 --> 00:33:57,520
Julia, I found her she's...

690
00:33:59,382 --> 00:34:00,747
Quentin.

691
00:34:02,551 --> 00:34:05,318
I missed you so much.

692
00:34:05,387 --> 00:34:07,954
Oh, my God.

693
00:34:08,023 --> 00:34:09,322
Hi.

694
00:34:13,228 --> 00:34:15,195
Are you okay?

695
00:34:15,263 --> 00:34:16,830
Yeah.
Are you?

696
00:34:16,898 --> 00:34:19,399
Not really.

697
00:34:19,468 --> 00:34:21,067
Without you.

698
00:34:21,136 --> 00:34:24,003
Did you get Reynard yet?

699
00:34:24,072 --> 00:34:25,972
I'm trying.

700
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:36,716
She talks about him
all the time.

701
00:34:36,785 --> 00:34:38,785
Says he's a good guy.

702
00:34:38,854 --> 00:34:41,354
Stupid sometimes, but good.

703
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:46,960
Is thereny way
we can take her with us too?

704
00:35:00,675 --> 00:35:03,309
I know you told security
to keep me out,

705
00:35:03,378 --> 00:35:05,912
but then I suggested
they let me in.

706
00:35:05,981 --> 00:35:08,314
Stalemate, I guess.

707
00:35:08,383 --> 00:35:09,983
Is this about Cowden?

708
00:35:10,051 --> 00:35:12,552
I think you just
overwhelmed him a little.

709
00:35:12,621 --> 00:35:15,221
I know it's a lot,
but it's worth it.

710
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:17,390
My wife.

711
00:35:17,459 --> 00:35:19,826
Is anything about our
relationship real?

712
00:35:19,895 --> 00:35:23,163
I've been controlling her
from the day we met, right?

713
00:35:23,231 --> 00:35:25,365
Yes.
Lucky her.

714
00:35:25,433 --> 00:35:27,267
How is that?

715
00:35:27,335 --> 00:35:29,035
She's a person.

716
00:35:29,104 --> 00:35:30,303
Yes.

717
00:35:30,372 --> 00:35:31,638
And you're not.

718
00:35:31,706 --> 00:35:33,406
The sooner you wrap
your head around that--

719
00:35:33,475 --> 00:35:35,642
No, no.

720
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:36,710
I don't want it.

721
00:35:36,778 --> 00:35:38,945
You want to be President

722
00:35:39,014 --> 00:35:41,114
of this entire idiotic country.

723
00:35:41,183 --> 00:35:43,516
You have always
sensed your place.

724
00:35:43,585 --> 00:35:45,885
Julia and Kady, they said
you did terrible things.

725
00:35:45,954 --> 00:35:47,787
I should've looked you up
on the spot.

726
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:50,657
You didn't because I
gently suggested you don't.

727
00:35:50,725 --> 00:35:52,325
It's for your own good, kid.

728
00:35:52,394 --> 00:35:54,294
So it's all true.

729
00:35:54,362 --> 00:35:55,895
Those poor women.

730
00:35:55,964 --> 00:35:57,664
Those women were hardly victims.

731
00:35:57,732 --> 00:36:00,166
They said they were just
trying to summon a little help

732
00:36:00,235 --> 00:36:01,434
from some kind of goddess--

733
00:36:01,503 --> 00:36:04,704
They were summoning
an evil bitch!

734
00:36:04,773 --> 00:36:06,739
You looked me up,
says trickster.

735
00:36:06,808 --> 00:36:08,241
See, that's honest.

736
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,609
Yes, I fuck with the weak.

737
00:36:09,678 --> 00:36:11,277
You know what that does?
Improves the herd.

738
00:36:11,346 --> 00:36:14,013
I help the same little creatures
you want to help.

739
00:36:14,082 --> 00:36:15,682
It's not surprising,
you're my son,

740
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,550
how else could it be but her?

741
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:20,353
The benevolent
"Our Lady Underground."

742
00:36:20,422 --> 00:36:22,021
It is all about her.

743
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:26,025
Power, attention, grinding men
and gods into the fucking dirt

744
00:36:26,094 --> 00:36:28,027
and then she leaves!

745
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:41,441
You loved her.

746
00:36:41,509 --> 00:36:44,811
Guess there's some things
you can't control, after all.

747
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,648
I can see you're upset.

748
00:36:48,717 --> 00:36:50,483
But I need you
to move past that.

749
00:36:50,552 --> 00:36:53,119
Stop worrying about humans.

750
00:36:53,188 --> 00:36:54,821
They're beneath you.

751
00:36:54,889 --> 00:36:57,624
This is your birthright, son.

752
00:36:57,692 --> 00:36:59,392
We're gonna do so much together.

753
00:37:03,331 --> 00:37:05,365
How'd you do it?
You know, turn me back?

754
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:07,066
A special Fillorian mint.

755
00:37:07,135 --> 00:37:09,736
And about 50 straight minutes
of casting,

756
00:37:09,804 --> 00:37:12,905
so I'm gonna need a minute
to recharge.

757
00:37:12,974 --> 00:37:15,975
You sure you don't want
any clothes, or...

758
00:37:16,044 --> 00:37:17,477
Eh.

759
00:37:17,545 --> 00:37:18,665
Can't you get Margo to help?

760
00:37:18,713 --> 00:37:20,113
You know, give you a break?

761
00:37:20,181 --> 00:37:22,148
I kind of threw her
in the dungeon.

762
00:37:22,217 --> 00:37:23,549
Got ya.

763
00:37:23,618 --> 00:37:25,518
Well, you'll run yourself dead,

764
00:37:25,587 --> 00:37:26,707
doing everything on your own.

765
00:37:26,755 --> 00:37:28,121
Believe me, I know.

766
00:37:28,189 --> 00:37:30,923
Pass some shit down the chain
to the governors

767
00:37:30,992 --> 00:37:35,762
or the dukes or whatever.

768
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:38,331
You don't have any governors?

769
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,899
No dukes?

770
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:43,403
- Get you some delegates, son.
- Right, really good idea.

771
00:37:43,471 --> 00:37:45,938
Select governors.

772
00:37:46,007 --> 00:37:47,907
Yet another task
for the High King.

773
00:37:47,976 --> 00:37:50,576
Or you just hold an election.

774
00:37:50,645 --> 00:37:54,681
Let the people pick their own,
you do<i> nada.</i>

775
00:37:54,749 --> 00:37:56,082
- That's--
- Stupid, is it stupid?

776
00:37:56,151 --> 00:37:57,850
- I'm sorry.
- Brilliant, Josh.

777
00:37:57,919 --> 00:38:00,753
I think you just invented
democracy,

778
00:38:00,822 --> 00:38:02,622
and it's going to save Fillory.

779
00:38:02,691 --> 00:38:05,224
Well, high five, brother.

780
00:38:09,798 --> 00:38:13,066
- Eliot?
- What the hell?

781
00:38:14,903 --> 00:38:18,271
Dude, I thought you were
off being, like,

782
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,440
the High King of Fillory?

783
00:38:20,508 --> 00:38:22,809
I am.

784
00:38:22,877 --> 00:38:25,478
I was.

785
00:38:25,547 --> 00:38:27,882
I think I just got kicked out.

786
00:38:35,328 --> 00:38:37,495
<i>Of course her book is relocated</i>

787
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:39,664
to the Poison Room.

788
00:38:39,699 --> 00:38:41,032
Okay.

789
00:38:41,067 --> 00:38:42,900
So what's our next move?

790
00:38:42,936 --> 00:38:44,469
Admit I'm fucking cursed?

791
00:38:44,504 --> 00:38:45,470
<i>Is this all you guys do?</i>

792
00:38:45,505 --> 00:38:46,904
Talk about your fee-fees?

793
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,373
I was kind of hoping
you'd get to fucking.

794
00:38:49,409 --> 00:38:50,742
How did you--

795
00:38:50,777 --> 00:38:53,444
Oh, hopped into your mind
when you hopped into hers.

796
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,012
It's a little trick
my dad's friends taught me.

797
00:38:55,048 --> 00:38:58,082
Your dad's friends are perverts?

798
00:38:58,118 --> 00:38:59,717
Thugs.
Magic mobsters.

799
00:38:59,753 --> 00:39:00,818
- No, they're not.
- Jesus.

800
00:39:00,854 --> 00:39:02,086
Which is why I'm leaving.

801
00:39:02,122 --> 00:39:04,288
- So's Willow.
- Meadow, doofus.

802
00:39:04,324 --> 00:39:05,289
Fine, kick me out.

803
00:39:05,325 --> 00:39:06,891
You really don't need my help.

804
00:39:06,926 --> 00:39:08,226
Help with what?

805
00:39:08,261 --> 00:39:10,795
Trying to break into
the Poison Room.

806
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:13,397
I've been in your crappy Nolan
movie for, like, 20 minutes.

807
00:39:13,433 --> 00:39:14,832
I heard everything.

808
00:39:14,868 --> 00:39:16,367
Been trying to get in there
myself, 'cause, you know,

809
00:39:16,402 --> 00:39:18,136
I'm curious about a few things.

810
00:39:18,171 --> 00:39:20,104
So you can either start from
square one on your own,

811
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,341
or you can hop the line
and join...

812
00:39:24,878 --> 00:39:26,744
Well, the pervy mob girl
has a point.

813
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,880
No.
It's dangerous.

814
00:39:28,915 --> 00:39:31,449
You know what's safe?
Nothing.

815
00:39:31,484 --> 00:39:33,017
You're not responsible
for me, okay?

816
00:39:33,052 --> 00:39:36,587
Free will, I exercise that shit.

817
00:39:36,623 --> 00:39:37,688
I'm gonna hate this.

818
00:39:37,724 --> 00:39:39,123
You hate everything.

819
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:41,425
That's why I like you.

820
00:39:41,461 --> 00:39:44,028
<i>Kady.
Kady!</i>

821
00:39:44,063 --> 00:39:45,997
<i>Kady, wake up.</i>

822
00:39:48,735 --> 00:39:50,468
- Kady.
- Hey.

823
00:39:50,503 --> 00:39:53,971
- What?
- Hey, you, uh, you got a guest.

824
00:39:55,275 --> 00:39:58,176
Professor Lipson told me
to bring him here.

825
00:40:01,915 --> 00:40:04,382
If you're still after Reynard,

826
00:40:04,417 --> 00:40:06,350
I want in.

827
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:12,089
Eliot?

828
00:40:14,661 --> 00:40:16,127
Oh, you.

829
00:40:16,162 --> 00:40:19,063
I shouldn't be here, but...

830
00:40:21,201 --> 00:40:23,734
Please.
Your Majesty.

831
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:26,337
- Be careful.
- So not a nice scotch, then?

832
00:40:26,372 --> 00:40:30,708
It will transport you
to the fairy realm.

833
00:40:30,743 --> 00:40:34,111
I must warn you, few return.

834
00:40:34,147 --> 00:40:37,448
But it is a chance to save Fen,

835
00:40:37,483 --> 00:40:39,784
the baby.

836
00:40:39,819 --> 00:40:41,352
I would go, but--

837
00:40:41,387 --> 00:40:43,855
You're a pussy who's in love
with a sloth,

838
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:46,190
who's currently a rat.

839
00:40:46,226 --> 00:40:50,127
And end of the day,
it's my mess to clean up.

840
00:40:50,163 --> 00:40:52,196
Tell Eliot that.

841
00:41:02,008 --> 00:41:03,975
<i>Q, it's time.</i>

842
00:41:05,979 --> 00:41:08,079
This is it.

843
00:41:08,114 --> 00:41:09,747
It's who I couldn't make
the math work.

844
00:41:09,782 --> 00:41:10,982
What math?

845
00:41:11,017 --> 00:41:12,617
Uh, the spell
to bring Alice back.

846
00:41:12,652 --> 00:41:14,852
I knew something was missing,
I just didn't know...

847
00:41:14,888 --> 00:41:18,890
It was me.

848
00:41:18,925 --> 00:41:20,625
You have to go now.

849
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,627
There's a portal in there,

850
00:41:22,662 --> 00:41:24,528
back to reception.

851
00:41:24,564 --> 00:41:26,831
And I'm glad we got to
say good-bye.

852
00:41:30,336 --> 00:41:33,104
Um, I'm gonna be back here
for good one day,

853
00:41:33,139 --> 00:41:36,507
and I am going to find you.

854
00:41:40,513 --> 00:41:42,046
Okay.

855
00:41:51,524 --> 00:41:52,823
You first.

856
00:42:12,545 --> 00:42:15,446
- Jules, what the hell?
- This isn't up for debate.

857
00:42:15,481 --> 00:42:16,981
We came here
so that you could--

858
00:42:17,016 --> 00:42:18,983
Yeah?
So?

859
00:42:19,018 --> 00:42:20,985
Things change.

860
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:22,653
- If you do this--
- I know.

861
00:42:22,689 --> 00:42:24,522
This is my one shot.

862
00:42:24,557 --> 00:42:26,290
And this is what
I want to do with it.

863
00:42:26,326 --> 00:42:28,259
I found them!
Stop!

864
00:42:28,294 --> 00:42:29,560
Come on, or we'll lose her, too.

865
00:42:29,595 --> 00:42:30,962
<i>You can't take that Shade!</i>

866
00:42:33,066 --> 00:42:35,566
It's all going to be okay,
Quentin.

867
