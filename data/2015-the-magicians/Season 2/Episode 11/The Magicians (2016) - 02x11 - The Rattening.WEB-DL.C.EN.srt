1
00:00:01,423 --> 00:00:03,310
Previously on The Magicians...

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:04,896
My hands won't cast.

3
00:00:04,932 --> 00:00:07,523
- We can help you, Penny.
- What's the catch?

4
00:00:07,643 --> 00:00:08,842
"Bound in service to the library

5
00:00:08,877 --> 00:00:10,977
up to and after my death"?

6
00:00:11,013 --> 00:00:13,413
- That isn't just any door.
- Then what is it?

7
00:00:13,448 --> 00:00:14,548
The Poison Room.

8
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:15,882
There is knowledge behind that door

9
00:00:15,918 --> 00:00:17,617
that could destroy
more than just people.

10
00:00:17,653 --> 00:00:19,052
It could destroy worlds.

11
00:00:19,087 --> 00:00:20,620
"The Ars Deicidium"?

12
00:00:20,656 --> 00:00:22,422
"The art of killing gods."

13
00:00:22,457 --> 00:00:24,858
King Idri is our honored guest.

14
00:00:24,893 --> 00:00:26,126
We're getting married.

15
00:00:26,161 --> 00:00:28,795
One big, royal polyamorous family.

16
00:00:28,831 --> 00:00:31,131
The fairies can bring back
the wellspring?

17
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:32,132
They can.

18
00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:33,633
And in return?

19
00:00:33,669 --> 00:00:35,602
The child that grows in the womb

20
00:00:35,637 --> 00:00:37,204
of the High King's wife.

21
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:40,140
Some friends and I summoned a goddess.

22
00:00:40,175 --> 00:00:42,809
You may address me as Reynard the Fox,

23
00:00:42,845 --> 00:00:44,711
trickster of the very stupid.

24
00:00:44,746 --> 00:00:47,380
Reynard's son is John Gaines?

25
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,015
My son...

26
00:00:50,752 --> 00:00:53,019
Jules, I talked to your shade.

27
00:00:53,055 --> 00:00:54,254
She's not gone.

28
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:55,622
So where is she?

29
00:00:55,657 --> 00:00:57,657
Shades go to the Underworld.

30
00:00:57,693 --> 00:00:59,593
The living can access the Underworld

31
00:00:59,628 --> 00:01:00,994
with the help of a Gatekeeper.

32
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:02,029
An Ancient One.

33
00:01:02,064 --> 00:01:04,631
I think I figured out
what an Ancient One is.

34
00:01:10,405 --> 00:01:13,039
Look, Q, you don't have to come with me.

35
00:01:13,075 --> 00:01:15,909
In fact, I don't think that you should.

36
00:01:15,944 --> 00:01:18,879
Noted, but I'm coming.

37
00:01:18,914 --> 00:01:21,381
You feel the energy coming off that?

38
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:24,117
Yeah, also the stink.

39
00:01:27,055 --> 00:01:30,357
I don't know, my ancient Greek
is a little rusty.

40
00:01:30,392 --> 00:01:32,792
"The old reveals itself to the new

41
00:01:32,828 --> 00:01:36,229
at the fall of milk teeth."

42
00:01:36,265 --> 00:01:38,298
Milk teeth?

43
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:39,866
Oh, baby teeth.

44
00:01:39,902 --> 00:01:42,435
You think we have to
stick one in to open it up?

45
00:01:42,471 --> 00:01:43,904
I mean, I could write a spell.

46
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:46,473
Uh, we could find
the nearest child's house

47
00:01:46,508 --> 00:01:47,708
expecting the Tooth Fairy and...

48
00:01:47,743 --> 00:01:50,443
Break in and steal their teeth?

49
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,946
I'd leave money.

50
00:01:54,182 --> 00:01:56,149
Uh, I hate to bring this up,
but I actually...

51
00:01:56,184 --> 00:01:57,550
I still have one...

52
00:01:57,586 --> 00:01:58,919
a molar that never came in.

53
00:01:58,954 --> 00:02:01,187
Oh, I know an extraction spell.

54
00:02:01,223 --> 00:02:02,155
Ah!

55
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,024
- Fuck!
- Sorry.

56
00:02:07,029 --> 00:02:09,229
This dragon better be fucking cool.

57
00:02:16,438 --> 00:02:19,114
Hmm...

58
00:02:19,149 --> 00:02:21,316
Or not.

59
00:02:37,768 --> 00:02:39,868
I wouldn't have guessed baby teeth.

60
00:02:39,903 --> 00:02:42,504
Why would a dragon want baby teeth?

61
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:46,174
- Shit.
- I collect baby teeth.

62
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:48,677
As I collect many things, little mammal.

63
00:02:54,017 --> 00:02:56,451
Uh, greetings, your Ladyship.

64
00:02:56,486 --> 00:02:58,186
"Your Ladyship"?

65
00:02:58,221 --> 00:03:01,389
I am a Queen of the Great Worms.

66
00:03:01,425 --> 00:03:02,958
Of course you are.

67
00:03:02,993 --> 00:03:05,427
Uh, that's awesome... I wasn't
suggesting that you weren't.

68
00:03:05,462 --> 00:03:08,663
Your manner does not endear
me to you, human.

69
00:03:12,102 --> 00:03:15,370
We seek passage to the
Underworld, oh Ancient One.

70
00:03:17,808 --> 00:03:20,375
Hmm. You seek to die.

71
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:24,846
Uh, no, actually, we were
hoping to come back after.

72
00:03:24,881 --> 00:03:26,915
Suit yourself.

73
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,017
I require a gift.

74
00:03:29,052 --> 00:03:31,619
A gift? Um...

75
00:03:31,655 --> 00:03:33,088
yeah, I mean, name it,

76
00:03:33,123 --> 00:03:35,256
and we'll get it for you.

77
00:03:35,292 --> 00:03:38,393
You already have it.

78
00:03:38,428 --> 00:03:40,729
It's in your pocket.

79
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:50,405
No. Pick something else.

80
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,607
No, if it gets you your Shade back...

81
00:03:52,642 --> 00:03:54,342
No.

82
00:03:54,378 --> 00:03:56,011
Fillory is your home.

83
00:03:56,046 --> 00:03:57,779
And what about your friends?
What if they need you?

84
00:03:57,814 --> 00:03:59,781
We can't.

85
00:04:01,852 --> 00:04:04,886
Queen of the Great Worms.

86
00:04:04,921 --> 00:04:07,055
What if I, uh, needed to borrow it

87
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,257
in the future, just super briefly?

88
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:10,525
No.

89
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,360
If you wish to return home,

90
00:04:12,396 --> 00:04:14,195
you must find other means.

91
00:04:14,231 --> 00:04:17,899
The first door remains open,
little mammal.

92
00:04:17,934 --> 00:04:22,470
Great, um, I super love riddles.

93
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:31,613
Are you giving me the button or not?

94
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:44,092
Your bodies will stay here,
and your souls will travel.

95
00:04:44,127 --> 00:04:46,561
You have 24 hours
to return to the portal.

96
00:04:46,596 --> 00:04:48,029
Or?

97
00:04:48,065 --> 00:04:51,366
I sit patiently,
waiting for you to come back.

98
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:55,470
No, I eat you... I'm a fucking
dragon, what do you expect?

99
00:04:55,505 --> 00:04:56,871
Great, good to know.

100
00:04:56,907 --> 00:04:59,674
Then it's settled.

101
00:05:05,382 --> 00:05:07,682
Jesus, a little warning next time.

102
00:05:07,717 --> 00:05:10,118
Really.

103
00:05:10,153 --> 00:05:13,288
Q, look.

104
00:05:13,323 --> 00:05:14,856
Time to go.

105
00:05:17,894 --> 00:05:20,128
Fucking millennials.

106
00:05:43,453 --> 00:05:45,987
Welcome to the Underworld.

107
00:05:48,058 --> 00:05:50,458
Please take a number.

108
00:05:55,499 --> 00:05:57,065
The fuck?

109

110
00:06:12,582 --> 00:06:14,349
Idri is almost here.

111
00:06:14,384 --> 00:06:17,619
And does anyone know where Fen is?

112
00:06:22,092 --> 00:06:25,193
I present King Idri of Loria.

113
00:06:29,132 --> 00:06:31,599
My life is perfect.

114
00:06:31,635 --> 00:06:32,934
Hello.

115
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:35,003
Josh... wine, canapÃ©s.

116
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:36,771
I said have it ready.

117
00:06:36,806 --> 00:06:39,607
We have a lovely blend of...

118
00:06:39,643 --> 00:06:40,775
Ahem. Okay.

119
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,010
And where are the fire dancers?

120
00:06:42,045 --> 00:06:45,180
I don't know.

121
00:06:45,215 --> 00:06:46,848
I'm sorry, I had a whole thing...

122
00:06:46,883 --> 00:06:48,616
Your Majesty, this presentation

123
00:06:48,652 --> 00:06:51,452
is beautiful, but...

124
00:06:51,488 --> 00:06:53,621
It would be so much better
with fire dancers, I know.

125
00:06:53,657 --> 00:06:56,524
I hope my arrival isn't
causing undue stress.

126
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,226
Stress?

127
00:06:58,261 --> 00:07:01,229
- I'm not stressed...
- Eliot.

128
00:07:01,264 --> 00:07:04,232
- I don't care about ceremony.
- You don't?

129
00:07:04,267 --> 00:07:07,769
- But...
- But I came here for you.

130
00:07:07,804 --> 00:07:11,639
Oh.

131
00:07:11,675 --> 00:07:13,608
Well...

132
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:16,644
the feeling's mutual.

133
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,649
Take me somewhere we can
become a bit better acquainted.

134
00:07:21,685 --> 00:07:23,585
Alone.

135
00:07:26,856 --> 00:07:29,324
Congratulations, you're dead.

136
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:33,027
You've passed through the veil
to the Underworld.

137
00:07:33,063 --> 00:07:34,829
Is this your final destination?

138
00:07:34,864 --> 00:07:36,297
No.

139
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,366
It's the first leg of your journey.

140
00:07:38,401 --> 00:07:41,569
We designed this part
of the Underworld for you,

141
00:07:41,605 --> 00:07:44,138
based on your life
and personal expectations

142
00:07:44,174 --> 00:07:47,008
to facilitate a comfortable transition.

143
00:07:47,043 --> 00:07:51,079
You've been grouped with others
who have similar expectations.

144
00:07:51,114 --> 00:07:52,347
Perfect, right?

145
00:07:52,382 --> 00:07:55,550
- Ow.
- What?

146
00:07:55,585 --> 00:07:58,453
Settle into this
next stage of your existence.

147
00:07:58,488 --> 00:08:00,888
In the unlikely event
you're missing your Shade,

148
00:08:00,924 --> 00:08:03,524
please report to a bellhop immediately.

149
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,593
Enjoy your wait.

150
00:08:09,165 --> 00:08:10,598
I guess we need to find a bellhop.

151
00:08:10,634 --> 00:08:12,500
Security, we have a Shade-less patron!

152
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:13,901
What? Hey!

153
00:08:13,937 --> 00:08:15,270
- Take him away.
- Why? Where are you taking me?

154
00:08:15,305 --> 00:08:17,639
- Thank you, thank you.
- Read me my rights!

155
00:08:17,674 --> 00:08:19,807
Hey, let go! Wait, ow!

156
00:08:19,843 --> 00:08:22,543
Or, you know, we take a beat.

157
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:24,245
173.

158
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:27,515
I'm 173.

159
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,916
Place your hands on the counter

160
00:08:28,952 --> 00:08:31,386
for identification, please.

161
00:08:34,524 --> 00:08:37,292
Hey, do you know where they
were taking that guy just now?

162
00:08:37,327 --> 00:08:40,995
Oh, his soul is missing a little piece.

163
00:08:41,031 --> 00:08:42,297
They just took him somewhere where

164
00:08:42,332 --> 00:08:44,098
he would be more comfortable.

165
00:08:44,134 --> 00:08:45,500
So he could be reunited with it?

166
00:08:45,535 --> 00:08:47,368
I doubt it, that's very difficult to do.

167
00:08:47,404 --> 00:08:49,837
Especially after a prolonged separation.

168
00:08:49,873 --> 00:08:51,105
Yeah, but you can't just take...

169
00:08:51,141 --> 00:08:52,573
I assure you, all the Shades

170
00:08:52,609 --> 00:08:55,943
are safe and well protected
for their eternity.

171
00:08:55,979 --> 00:08:57,979
Nothing to worry over.

172
00:08:58,014 --> 00:08:59,180
Ah, here we are.

173
00:08:59,215 --> 00:09:02,283
Wicker and Coldwater.

174
00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:03,918
Oh.

175
00:09:03,953 --> 00:09:05,320
Oh, my.

176
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:13,194
- What?
- You've both died 39 times.

177
00:09:13,229 --> 00:09:15,997
Aha... time loop. Thought so.

178
00:09:16,032 --> 00:09:18,733
Our computers do not handle these well.

179
00:09:18,768 --> 00:09:21,402
This will take a bit to sort out.

180
00:09:21,438 --> 00:09:23,371
Once you're in the system,
we'll reunite you

181
00:09:23,406 --> 00:09:24,772
with your immediate karmic circle,

182
00:09:24,808 --> 00:09:26,941
but until then, I'll need to
stick you somewhere.

183
00:09:26,976 --> 00:09:28,376
Do you like skiing?

184
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:30,311
Look, I thought
this was just a waystation.

185
00:09:30,347 --> 00:09:32,680
- We're kind of in a hurry...
- Oh, it is.

186
00:09:32,716 --> 00:09:35,216
But souls do stay a while,

187
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:37,885
until they're ready to...

188
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:39,320
move on.

189
00:09:39,356 --> 00:09:41,389
Snorkeling? Art museums?

190
00:09:41,424 --> 00:09:44,292
Actually, is it possible
to check on a few names?

191
00:09:44,327 --> 00:09:47,462
I think I might have
a karmic circle we could visit.

192
00:09:56,773 --> 00:09:58,072
You're making progress.

193
00:09:58,108 --> 00:09:59,273
Am I?

194
00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:01,409
Nothing's happening.

195
00:10:01,444 --> 00:10:04,045
It's an exceedingly
difficult way to do magic.

196
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,348
Trying to isolate muscles not
generally associated with...

197
00:10:07,384 --> 00:10:09,484
Call it what it is.

198
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,119
Sphincter magic.

199
00:10:11,154 --> 00:10:12,820
Gets me there, no shame.

200
00:10:12,856 --> 00:10:14,088
And if it doesn't,

201
00:10:14,124 --> 00:10:16,290
we all need a healthy pelvic floor.

202
00:10:16,326 --> 00:10:18,159
Now, I'm afraid study time is over.

203
00:10:18,194 --> 00:10:20,094
I have your next job.

204
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,897
- Re-shelving books.
- Great.

205
00:10:22,932 --> 00:10:25,166
Any questions, direct them to...

206
00:10:25,201 --> 00:10:26,501
where'd she go?

207
00:10:26,536 --> 00:10:28,102
- Sylvia!
- What?

208
00:10:28,138 --> 00:10:29,637
Shh!

209
00:10:33,943 --> 00:10:37,612
Penny, Sylvia. Sylvia, Penny.

210
00:10:37,647 --> 00:10:39,614
So what, I'm babysitting now?

211
00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:40,782
Oh, no.

212
00:10:40,817 --> 00:10:42,250
Sylvia is your supervisor.

213
00:10:42,285 --> 00:10:44,585
Good luck, I'll check back.

214
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,724
Nice scarf.

215
00:10:51,795 --> 00:10:56,063
Anyway, I married Fen because I had to.

216
00:10:56,099 --> 00:10:59,567
But I didn't know her at all.

217
00:10:59,602 --> 00:11:02,069
And now...

218
00:11:02,105 --> 00:11:05,173
I don't know you.

219
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,974
My wife used to say, there's one way

220
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:10,912
to learn to be with another person.

221
00:11:10,947 --> 00:11:12,947
The hard way?

222
00:11:12,982 --> 00:11:15,817
Actually, yes.

223
00:11:15,852 --> 00:11:17,385
Stand up.

224
00:11:22,892 --> 00:11:25,660
Would you mind removing this?

225
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:35,470
Buttons, too, please.

226
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,875
- What are you doing?
- Shh.

227
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:44,278
This is a lesson.

228
00:11:44,314 --> 00:11:47,748
All of them.

229
00:11:47,784 --> 00:11:49,050
Please.

230
00:11:53,189 --> 00:11:55,022
I really hate to bring this up,

231
00:11:55,058 --> 00:11:58,960
but you do realize there's
nothing we can actually do.

232
00:11:58,995 --> 00:12:00,695
Oh, I know.

233
00:12:02,565 --> 00:12:04,799
And yet, there's so much we can do.

234
00:12:06,836 --> 00:12:09,203
I can't touch you,

235
00:12:09,239 --> 00:12:11,639
you can't touch me,

236
00:12:11,674 --> 00:12:15,209
but I can tell you
how I want to touch you.

237
00:12:15,245 --> 00:12:19,280
And you can show me
how you like to be touched.

238
00:12:19,315 --> 00:12:22,283
I admire your commitment to education.

239
00:12:23,987 --> 00:12:27,355
If you're waiting for
my permission, don't.

240
00:12:38,301 --> 00:12:40,434
What the fuck?

241
00:12:41,938 --> 00:12:44,305
Eliot, Heloise just turned into a rat!

242
00:12:46,342 --> 00:12:47,508
Who is that?

243
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:52,164
I'm not getting laid tonight, am I?

244
00:12:55,198 --> 00:12:57,569
- This is all of them?
- We can't be sure.

245
00:12:57,932 --> 00:12:59,074
So many people have vanished

246
00:12:59,105 --> 00:13:01,173
and there are so many rats
in the castle already.

247
00:13:01,293 --> 00:13:04,027
Well, one of 'em has to be Fen.

248
00:13:04,096 --> 00:13:06,363
Okay, bottom line it for me.

249
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,564
What the fuck is going on?

250
00:13:07,633 --> 00:13:08,999
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

251
00:13:09,067 --> 00:13:11,101
But this magic,
I've never seen it before.

252
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:14,571
Abigail? If you can hear me, squeak.

253
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,273
Let me know you're okay.

254
00:13:16,341 --> 00:13:20,210
Why didn't I study
how to speak rat in school?

255
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,480
Okay, search the castle.

256
00:13:23,549 --> 00:13:24,549
Find every rat.

257
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,183
And then Council meeting.

258
00:13:26,251 --> 00:13:29,019
Or what's left of the Council.

259
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:50,774
What do we call that?

260
00:13:50,842 --> 00:13:52,542
Mm...

261
00:13:52,611 --> 00:13:55,478
In-sex-tion?

262
00:13:55,547 --> 00:13:57,981
Inter-cepti-course?

263
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:01,218
Incepti-sex.

264
00:14:01,286 --> 00:14:03,353
"Incepti-sex."

265
00:14:03,422 --> 00:14:05,522
I like that.

266
00:14:05,591 --> 00:14:08,658
That said, I like real life better.

267
00:14:08,727 --> 00:14:10,760
Mm.

268
00:14:10,829 --> 00:14:14,631
But at least this way, we
don't have to get up for beers.

269
00:14:18,537 --> 00:14:20,303
Thank you.

270
00:14:24,243 --> 00:14:27,344
So, no pressure,

271
00:14:27,412 --> 00:14:29,779
but...

272
00:14:29,848 --> 00:14:31,147
any word on the Poison Room?

273
00:14:31,216 --> 00:14:32,682
Believe me, I want to get in there.

274
00:14:32,751 --> 00:14:34,451
It's... it's above my pay grade.

275
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:36,286
I need a code to get in.

276
00:14:36,355 --> 00:14:38,054
Well, what about that librarian?

277
00:14:38,123 --> 00:14:39,556
Oh, man, if she has the code,

278
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,625
it is locked down tighter
than a nun's pussy.

279
00:14:41,693 --> 00:14:43,593
Right, of course it is.

280
00:14:43,662 --> 00:14:47,464
Hey, does she have a book of her?

281
00:14:47,532 --> 00:14:50,433
Everyone has a book.

282
00:14:50,502 --> 00:14:51,334
You're thinking...

283
00:14:51,403 --> 00:14:54,104
If the room is that important...

284
00:14:54,172 --> 00:14:56,606
It's in her book.

285
00:14:56,675 --> 00:14:57,941
Okay.

286
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,010
I can work on that.

287
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:02,145
Hey, what's up with the Senator?

288
00:15:02,214 --> 00:15:03,546
He went back to work.

289
00:15:03,615 --> 00:15:04,981
He made up some bullshit excuse

290
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,216
about the kidnapping.

291
00:15:06,285 --> 00:15:08,451
All the news outlets bought it.

292
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,053
But hey, get this...

293
00:15:10,122 --> 00:15:12,756
I saw Reynard in the back of
a press photo.

294
00:15:12,824 --> 00:15:15,358
In a suit, like an advisor or something.

295
00:15:15,427 --> 00:15:17,394
Are you kidding me?

296
00:15:17,462 --> 00:15:19,663
He's a trickster.

297
00:15:19,731 --> 00:15:21,431
Guess that includes his own son.

298
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,766
Jesus Christ.

299
00:15:24,336 --> 00:15:26,036
We can't get one more vote?

300
00:15:26,104 --> 00:15:27,944
We're in touch with
Matthews, Bauer, Wheeler.

301
00:15:28,006 --> 00:15:30,640
Just give 'em a couple of days,
they'll come to their senses.

302
00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:32,042
Call in Senator Cowden.

303
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,810
Why bother? He won't budge.

304
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:36,246
We can change his mind. Trust me.

305
00:15:36,315 --> 00:15:38,248
How?

306
00:15:38,317 --> 00:15:40,517
Everyone, give us a minute.

307
00:15:45,991 --> 00:15:48,958
So they're taking your orders now?

308
00:15:49,027 --> 00:15:50,193
Have been for a while.

309
00:15:50,262 --> 00:15:52,295
I controlled their minds.

310
00:15:52,364 --> 00:15:55,265
Just like you have, many, many times.

311
00:15:55,334 --> 00:15:56,966
I don't know what you're talking about.

312
00:15:57,035 --> 00:15:59,002
You know you have that power.

313
00:15:59,071 --> 00:16:01,471
You've been using it your whole life.

314
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,041
I always thought I had some kind of...

315
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:08,445
god-level good luck.

316
00:16:08,513 --> 00:16:11,481
True, you've only used it instinctively,

317
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,083
but I'm here now.

318
00:16:13,151 --> 00:16:15,285
I can teach you how to use it at will.

319
00:16:15,354 --> 00:16:16,886
Easy.

320
00:16:16,955 --> 00:16:19,022
And once you've mastered it,

321
00:16:19,091 --> 00:16:21,524
that's how you get Cowden's vote.

322
00:16:21,593 --> 00:16:23,126
I don't know that I want to do that.

323
00:16:23,195 --> 00:16:26,062
- It feels like cheating.
- They all don't cheat?

324
00:16:26,131 --> 00:16:28,198
Everyone uses whatever
they've got, John,

325
00:16:28,266 --> 00:16:30,500
and the bad ones don't hesitate.

326
00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:31,801
So someone like you,

327
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,737
someone who wants to do some

328
00:16:33,805 --> 00:16:35,805
actual good in the world,

329
00:16:35,874 --> 00:16:38,875
how can you not?

330
00:16:38,944 --> 00:16:40,944
Here's all you have to do.

331
00:16:41,012 --> 00:16:43,079
Look at me.

332
00:16:45,817 --> 00:16:47,884
You look him straight in the eye,

333
00:16:47,953 --> 00:16:50,687
and you tell him, plainly.

334
00:16:50,756 --> 00:16:52,989
Directly.

335
00:16:53,058 --> 00:16:55,258
That's it?

336
00:16:55,327 --> 00:16:58,461
It's that simple.

337
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:00,330
Good luck with the meeting, Senator.

338
00:17:13,044 --> 00:17:14,484
Why would anyone want their afterlife

339
00:17:14,513 --> 00:17:17,080
to look like a terrible
middle school birthday party?

340
00:17:17,149 --> 00:17:18,748
Is this about your "incident"?

341
00:17:18,817 --> 00:17:20,717
- I moved on.
- Have you?

342
00:17:20,786 --> 00:17:22,185
- Julia?
- Julia!

343
00:17:22,254 --> 00:17:24,387
- Julia!
- Oh, welcome!

344
00:17:24,456 --> 00:17:26,423
Welcome!

345
00:17:26,491 --> 00:17:28,091
Where's Bender? Is he okay?

346
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,592
He's great. He moved on.

347
00:17:29,661 --> 00:17:32,429
Uh, who's your friend,
and what's his shoe size?

348
00:17:32,497 --> 00:17:34,497
Uh, we're not really here to bowl.

349
00:17:34,566 --> 00:17:36,366
Kid, the first rule of being dead,

350
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:38,435
if you're here, ya bowl.

351
00:17:38,503 --> 00:17:40,069
We're actually not dead, either.

352
00:17:40,138 --> 00:17:41,538
Uh, we're here because
we need your help.

353
00:17:41,606 --> 00:17:43,306
Julia?

354
00:17:50,382 --> 00:17:52,749
What?

355
00:17:52,818 --> 00:17:54,083
Nothing.

356
00:17:54,152 --> 00:17:56,119
It's... it's good to see you, Richard.

357
00:17:56,188 --> 00:17:58,621
- I mean, the real you.
- The real me?

358
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,857
What happened?

359
00:18:00,926 --> 00:18:02,058
I need your help.

360
00:18:02,127 --> 00:18:04,294
I need to find my Shade.

361
00:18:04,362 --> 00:18:05,895
Okay.

362
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:10,960
The underworld is massive.
There's every ecosystem.

363
00:18:11,088 --> 00:18:13,332
Nearest we can tell, about 2,000 islands

364
00:18:13,603 --> 00:18:15,303
built to look like Hawaii.

365
00:18:15,371 --> 00:18:16,604
And you went with a bowling alley?

366
00:18:16,673 --> 00:18:17,673
Fuck yeah.

367
00:18:17,707 --> 00:18:18,906
And the powers that be

368
00:18:18,975 --> 00:18:21,275
are into whatever helps us settle in

369
00:18:21,344 --> 00:18:22,877
so that we can move on.

370
00:18:22,946 --> 00:18:24,879
Ow, yeah! Whoo!

371
00:18:24,948 --> 00:18:27,348
- "Powers that be"?
- Yeah. Gods.

372
00:18:27,417 --> 00:18:28,916
We were right about them being real.

373
00:18:28,985 --> 00:18:30,585
Hades created the Underworld,

374
00:18:30,653 --> 00:18:32,053
runs it with his wife, Persephone.

375
00:18:32,121 --> 00:18:34,789
They live in a big house way over here.

376
00:18:34,857 --> 00:18:37,191
It's a beautiful area called Elysium.

377
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,594
Apparently, they used to
come and go like clockwork

378
00:18:39,662 --> 00:18:42,196
every fall and spring, but a while back,

379
00:18:42,265 --> 00:18:43,531
they just disappeared.

380
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,601
Wait, why are you
doing all this, Richard?

381
00:18:46,669 --> 00:18:48,936
I know you. This is a project.

382
00:18:49,005 --> 00:18:50,871
I'm trying to find my son.

383
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,541
I don't know where he is,
if he's even still here.

384
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,076
But he's got to be somewhere.

385
00:18:55,144 --> 00:18:58,012
And they won't tell me a damn thing.

386
00:18:58,081 --> 00:19:00,114
Why not?

387
00:19:00,183 --> 00:19:03,451
I'm flagged as culpable in his death.

388
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:04,919
There are rules.

389
00:19:04,988 --> 00:19:07,288
And friends to help me break them.

390
00:19:09,058 --> 00:19:11,392
Okay, so wait, so where
do they keep the Shades?

391
00:19:11,461 --> 00:19:12,827
Sorry, we don't know that yet.

392
00:19:12,895 --> 00:19:14,095
So we're flying blind?

393
00:19:14,163 --> 00:19:16,397
Hun, you're gonna have to bowl.

394
00:19:16,466 --> 00:19:18,332
No, look, I had an incident
when I was a kid.

395
00:19:18,401 --> 00:19:20,368
- My fingers got stuck in the...
- Oh, get over it.

396
00:19:20,436 --> 00:19:21,736
Your girl would.

397
00:19:21,804 --> 00:19:23,771
- She's not my girl.
- No shit.

398
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,439
She's tough as granite.

399
00:19:25,508 --> 00:19:27,575
And you're afraid to bowl.

400
00:19:27,644 --> 00:19:28,676
Fine.

401
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:37,485
How long before the dragon
eats you and Quentin?

402
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:39,186
Tomorrow morning.

403
00:19:39,255 --> 00:19:40,721
Always the one to tell the impossible

404
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:41,989
to go fuck itself, huh?

405
00:19:42,058 --> 00:19:45,526
Yeah, well, it doesn't always listen.

406
00:19:45,595 --> 00:19:47,795
They'll know where the Shades
are kept at reception.

407
00:19:47,864 --> 00:19:49,997
I don't know, they didn't seem too keen

408
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:52,667
on helping out a person
who looked like this.

409
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:55,636
Shit, it seems to be closing up

410
00:19:55,705 --> 00:19:57,772
much faster down here.

411
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,273
Okay, so we hurry.

412
00:19:59,342 --> 00:20:01,242
But just... not for nothing,
reception isn't keen

413
00:20:01,311 --> 00:20:03,778
to help much of anyone... I can't
count the number of times

414
00:20:03,846 --> 00:20:08,115
I've been kicked out of there,
trying to find my little boy.

415
00:20:08,184 --> 00:20:10,851
- I have an idea.
- Oh, my God, Julia!

416
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,054
I...I got a strike.

417
00:20:13,122 --> 00:20:14,021
Whoo!

418
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:15,523
Yeah, Q!

419
00:20:15,591 --> 00:20:17,792
The thing about the
Underworld is, the first week,

420
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,727
it's always a strike.

421
00:20:22,265 --> 00:20:24,598
Let him have this one.

422
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:26,467
Whoo! Go, Q!

423
00:20:26,536 --> 00:20:27,702
Ow!

424
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:37,445
- You wanted to talk?
- You lying son of a bitch.

425
00:20:37,513 --> 00:20:41,449
You turned Fen into a rat,
along with half the castle.

426
00:20:41,517 --> 00:20:43,384
Fen is in her human form,

427
00:20:43,453 --> 00:20:45,052
in the Fairy Realm.

428
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:46,620
And she was taken because you tried to

429
00:20:46,689 --> 00:20:47,988
get clever with our deal.

430
00:20:48,057 --> 00:20:51,225
So you turned half my staff
into snake food?

431
00:20:51,294 --> 00:20:53,427
- That wasn't the fairies.
- Oh.

432
00:20:53,496 --> 00:20:57,131
Well, it sure smells like
their whimsical bullshit.

433
00:20:58,334 --> 00:21:00,301
"Whimsical."

434
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,203
It's the mark of the stupid
and the arrogant

435
00:21:02,271 --> 00:21:04,438
to attack what you can't comprehend.

436
00:21:04,507 --> 00:21:06,073
Fine.

437
00:21:06,142 --> 00:21:07,875
Get it out of your system.

438
00:21:07,944 --> 00:21:10,244
Then if you know what's going on,

439
00:21:10,313 --> 00:21:12,313
just tell me.

440
00:21:12,382 --> 00:21:14,081
I take it back.

441
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:17,485
You're not entirely simple-minded.

442
00:21:17,553 --> 00:21:18,853
There's another power,

443
00:21:18,921 --> 00:21:20,921
which you made the mistake
of overlooking.

444
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,990
You want to be specific, or not?

445
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:25,025
A power without logic.

446
00:21:25,094 --> 00:21:29,430
A power that acts, not for gain,
but solely because it can.

447
00:21:29,499 --> 00:21:32,099
That's the true danger.

448
00:21:32,168 --> 00:21:33,634
Face that.

449
00:21:33,703 --> 00:21:36,303
Or face the end of your kingdom.

450
00:21:45,715 --> 00:21:47,381
Uh, hey.

451
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:50,584
- I got a question for you.
- Of course.

452
00:21:50,653 --> 00:21:52,386
How can I help?

453
00:21:52,455 --> 00:21:55,990
You know, I never got your name.

454
00:21:56,058 --> 00:21:58,859
You may call me Head Librarian.

455
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:01,829
And, uh...

456
00:22:01,898 --> 00:22:04,765
what do I get to call you
outside of work?

457
00:22:04,834 --> 00:22:06,867
I see what you're getting at.

458
00:22:06,936 --> 00:22:09,737
But interoffice courtship
is expressly prohibited.

459
00:22:09,806 --> 00:22:12,206
I'm flattered, but rules are rule.

460
00:22:12,275 --> 00:22:13,841
Are they?

461
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:16,977
Always?

462
00:22:17,046 --> 00:22:19,747
Penny, please don't take it personally,

463
00:22:19,816 --> 00:22:22,383
but you're not my type.

464
00:22:22,452 --> 00:22:24,885
You're a touch emotionally insecure,

465
00:22:24,954 --> 00:22:27,788
for which you compensate heavily
with boisterousness

466
00:22:27,857 --> 00:22:30,257
and foul language.

467
00:22:30,326 --> 00:22:32,426
I'm here if you need anything else.

468
00:22:45,908 --> 00:22:48,108
- Hey, guys.
- Mr. Corrigan.

469
00:22:48,177 --> 00:22:49,977
Uh, Mr. Corrigan, you have
no need to be in here.

470
00:22:50,046 --> 00:22:51,278
Just a couple of questions.

471
00:22:51,347 --> 00:22:53,180
- I'm gonna take a number.
- Please, sir.

472
00:22:53,249 --> 00:22:55,282
Um, you know what, I'm gonna
take a couple of numbers,

473
00:22:55,351 --> 00:22:57,451
just in case I don't...
I don't hear the first number.

474
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,120
Yeah, wow, you guys got
a lot of numbers.

475
00:22:59,188 --> 00:23:00,554
Mr. Corrigan, I beseech you.

476
00:23:00,623 --> 00:23:02,423
Oh, no, does this thing
run out of numbers?

477
00:23:02,492 --> 00:23:04,332
- There we go.
- Playtime's over, Mr. Corrigan.

478
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,060
I'm not playing,
I really have questions.

479
00:23:06,128 --> 00:23:07,528
Quite the jokester you are. That is it.

480
00:23:07,597 --> 00:23:10,064
- Security!
- Don't call security, Thomas.

481
00:23:10,132 --> 00:23:11,899
- Security!
- Oh, no, security.

482
00:23:11,968 --> 00:23:13,567
- They're on their way.
- No, no, no.

483
00:23:13,636 --> 00:23:15,503
I'm just getting a number here.
Ha ha, very funny.

484
00:23:15,571 --> 00:23:17,705
Does this thing run out of numbers?

485
00:23:17,773 --> 00:23:19,540
It's locked.

486
00:23:19,609 --> 00:23:22,610
Security!

487
00:23:22,678 --> 00:23:24,478
- "Disconnected Shade."
- Where?

488
00:23:24,547 --> 00:23:25,613
It doesn't say.

489
00:23:25,681 --> 00:23:27,347
Just says "E."

490
00:23:29,218 --> 00:23:31,151
Another one, "disconnected Shade, 'E.'"

491
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,388
Wait, if they all say "E"...

492
00:23:34,457 --> 00:23:36,223
- Elysium.
- Yes.

493
00:23:36,292 --> 00:23:39,326
Okay, great, it's the complete
opposite end of the Underworld.

494
00:23:39,395 --> 00:23:41,962
Take him away for
disciplinary processing.

495
00:23:42,031 --> 00:23:43,564
- Thank you.
- There's no need, guys.

496
00:23:43,633 --> 00:23:45,165
Okay, you got me.

497
00:23:45,234 --> 00:23:48,802
Hope you had some fun to make
your confinement worthwhile.

498
00:23:48,871 --> 00:23:50,938
Oh, what's a few weeks out of eternity?

499
00:23:58,915 --> 00:24:01,515
This is books for school kids.

500
00:24:01,584 --> 00:24:02,516
If it's so important,

501
00:24:02,585 --> 00:24:05,219
finding me that five mil
can't be too hard.

502
00:24:05,288 --> 00:24:06,954
I'm not adding another amendment.

503
00:24:07,023 --> 00:24:09,156
You invited me in.

504
00:24:09,225 --> 00:24:11,659
You knew what you were getting into.

505
00:24:11,727 --> 00:24:13,627
Right.

506
00:24:22,505 --> 00:24:25,072
You're going to support this bill.

507
00:24:25,141 --> 00:24:28,576
In fact, your yes will be
the first vote cast.

508
00:24:32,315 --> 00:24:35,549
John, this bill should've
been passed a long time ago.

509
00:24:35,618 --> 00:24:38,953
And I'm sorry for trying to
drag you into the ditch on this.

510
00:24:39,021 --> 00:24:41,722
You have my vote.

511
00:24:41,791 --> 00:24:44,124
Then I thank you for your help.

512
00:24:45,928 --> 00:24:47,294
You all right?

513
00:24:50,566 --> 00:24:52,232
Let me get you some water.

514
00:24:52,301 --> 00:24:55,336
I...I must've stood up too fast.

515
00:24:55,404 --> 00:24:58,205
Here you go.

516
00:24:58,274 --> 00:24:59,840
I...I need to make a...

517
00:24:59,909 --> 00:25:01,208
Becca!

518
00:25:01,277 --> 00:25:04,085
Becca, get the doctor.
Get the doctor now!

519
00:25:06,699 --> 00:25:09,000
John, I'm sorry but

520
00:25:09,307 --> 00:25:11,269
I think you're overestimating
yourself, here.

521
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:14,572
No, honey, I'm being 100% literal.

522
00:25:14,641 --> 00:25:16,408
I am not human, Cindy.

523
00:25:16,476 --> 00:25:18,977
And I know it sounds ridiculous,
but it is true.

524
00:25:19,046 --> 00:25:20,211
Okay...

525
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,414
I think that you have
been working too hard...

526
00:25:22,482 --> 00:25:23,482
No, I haven't.

527
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,807
I haven't.

528
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,153
I am telling you the truth.

529
00:25:28,221 --> 00:25:29,587
Because you are the one I trust.

530
00:25:29,656 --> 00:25:32,791
You are the only one, really.

531
00:25:32,859 --> 00:25:36,494
And I really just need
your support right now, babe.

532
00:25:38,398 --> 00:25:40,899
Of course, honey.

533
00:25:40,967 --> 00:25:43,702
I apologize.

534
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:46,538
I know that you always find
a way to do the right thing,

535
00:25:46,606 --> 00:25:48,373
and I am here for you.

536
00:25:48,442 --> 00:25:50,108
Whatever you need.

537
00:25:54,114 --> 00:25:55,513
Now come on.

538
00:25:55,582 --> 00:25:57,248
Let's go home.

539
00:26:25,645 --> 00:26:27,412
It's like a Shade orphanage.

540
00:26:27,481 --> 00:26:28,546
We should hurry.

541
00:26:28,615 --> 00:26:29,581
We're running out of time.

542
00:26:29,649 --> 00:26:31,216
We should split up.

543
00:26:31,284 --> 00:26:33,385
I kind of have a thing about
splitting up in houses

544
00:26:33,453 --> 00:26:35,086
full of creepy kids.

545
00:26:44,698 --> 00:26:46,331
Hey, can we ask you a question?

546
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,500
- Sure.
- What was that?

547
00:26:48,568 --> 00:26:50,168
That you just did with the money?

548
00:26:50,237 --> 00:26:52,570
For the little boy?

549
00:26:52,639 --> 00:26:53,738
What little boy?

550
00:26:53,807 --> 00:26:56,007
The little boy with the shitty dad.

551
00:26:56,076 --> 00:26:57,076
He ran away.

552
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:58,710
And now he's cold and hungry.

553
00:26:58,779 --> 00:27:01,045
He'll find it on the sidewalk
any minute.

554
00:27:03,049 --> 00:27:05,283
And that...

555
00:27:05,352 --> 00:27:07,051
She's in a hospital room.

556
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,420
She's making them bloom.

557
00:27:08,488 --> 00:27:11,523
It's a really obvious miracle,
but that's okay.

558
00:27:11,591 --> 00:27:13,758
The girl in the room
is gonna die anyways.

559
00:27:13,827 --> 00:27:15,660
So you're all making miracles.

560
00:27:15,729 --> 00:27:18,062
Just little tiny ones, though.

561
00:27:18,131 --> 00:27:19,431
Cool.

562
00:27:19,499 --> 00:27:22,167
Um, we were looking for a Shade.

563
00:27:22,235 --> 00:27:26,504
- Her name's Julia.
- Yeah, uh, she looks like her.

564
00:27:26,573 --> 00:27:28,339
Kind of. Um, and...

565
00:27:28,408 --> 00:27:30,074
Well, she's a... she's a mess.

566
00:27:30,143 --> 00:27:32,610
We all were when we got here.

567
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:33,778
Anything else?

568
00:27:33,847 --> 00:27:35,880
Um, she's brave.

569
00:27:35,949 --> 00:27:38,550
And funny, and she probably made friends

570
00:27:38,618 --> 00:27:41,219
with some of the most shy,
maladjusted Shades.

571
00:27:41,288 --> 00:27:44,756
She's curious, and she won't
take no for an answer.

572
00:27:45,959 --> 00:27:48,526
Are you looking for the kind of new one,

573
00:27:48,595 --> 00:27:51,162
who's always getting in trouble
and sneaking into

574
00:27:51,231 --> 00:27:53,031
Ms. Persephone's room...
because, you know,

575
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:54,966
we're never supposed to go in there.

576
00:27:56,002 --> 00:27:59,070
Yeah. Yeah, that does sound like her.

577
00:27:59,139 --> 00:28:01,773
I just saw her. This way.

578
00:28:05,412 --> 00:28:06,511
Up those stairs.

579
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,379
Last door.

580
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:12,584
- Eugene?
- Yeah?

581
00:28:12,652 --> 00:28:14,285
Who's that?

582
00:28:14,354 --> 00:28:15,653
That's Ms. Persephone.

583
00:28:15,722 --> 00:28:17,822
She hasn't been here
for a really long time

584
00:28:17,891 --> 00:28:19,491
and no one knows where she is.

585
00:28:21,895 --> 00:28:24,229
Thank you so much for all your help.

586
00:28:28,835 --> 00:28:32,036
That's Our Lady Underground.

587
00:28:32,105 --> 00:28:33,438
What?

588
00:28:33,507 --> 00:28:35,406
The one that you...

589
00:28:42,482 --> 00:28:45,850
So you were real all along, huh?

590
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,319
Just completely AWOL.

591
00:28:48,388 --> 00:28:50,955
Self-centered bitch.

592
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,362
We were so stupid to love you.

593
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:59,097
Jules...

594
00:28:59,165 --> 00:29:01,466
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

595
00:29:01,535 --> 00:29:05,169
Look, I'm glad I know.

596
00:29:05,238 --> 00:29:07,272
It's always better to know, Q.

597
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,940
You keep watch.

598
00:29:09,009 --> 00:29:10,508
I'll sneak in and find the part of me

599
00:29:10,577 --> 00:29:12,143
that already snuck in.

600
00:29:12,212 --> 00:29:14,045
Hmm.

601
00:29:19,452 --> 00:29:21,185
We're under attack.

602
00:29:21,254 --> 00:29:24,923
The Rattening, now reports of
upside down rain.

603
00:29:24,991 --> 00:29:27,926
Correct... as well as ant hills
turning into volcanoes,

604
00:29:27,994 --> 00:29:30,562
the Balmy Sea turning to acid,

605
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:33,731
and the mysterious disappearance
of all blondes

606
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,466
in the province of Crickety Cove.

607
00:29:35,535 --> 00:29:39,070
The talking animals report
this includes palomino horses.

608
00:29:39,139 --> 00:29:41,906
Also, every chicken in Fillory
has laryngitis.

609
00:29:41,975 --> 00:29:45,376
Is there a pattern to any of this?

610
00:29:45,445 --> 00:29:46,778
None that we can tell.

611
00:29:46,846 --> 00:29:49,013
Only that whatever it is,
it is increasing.

612
00:29:49,082 --> 00:29:51,983
Idri's turned into a rat,
so it isn't the Lorians.

613
00:29:52,052 --> 00:29:54,552
We've incapacitated the FU Fighters.

614
00:29:54,621 --> 00:29:56,354
That leaves...

615
00:29:56,423 --> 00:29:58,256
the people in this room.

616
00:30:01,294 --> 00:30:02,827
Your Highness?

617
00:30:02,896 --> 00:30:04,862
If anyone has anything to say...

618
00:30:04,931 --> 00:30:06,831
I'm embezzling funds
from the royal treasury.

619
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,700
- Why did I just say that?
- Hah!

620
00:30:08,768 --> 00:30:11,903
Because there's truth serum
in this wine.

621
00:30:11,972 --> 00:30:15,807
I've truthied you. Anyone else?

622
00:30:15,875 --> 00:30:18,776
Abigail and I have been using
the castle guards

623
00:30:18,845 --> 00:30:20,345
to run an escort service.

624
00:30:20,413 --> 00:30:22,046
Gross.

625
00:30:22,115 --> 00:30:23,481
But clever.

626
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:25,650
Doesn't help us.

627
00:30:25,719 --> 00:30:27,285
Should've made this stronger.

628
00:30:30,223 --> 00:30:31,656
It was me.

629
00:30:37,263 --> 00:30:40,098
I made a deal with the fairies
and I know where Fen is.

630
00:30:45,772 --> 00:30:49,107
You got to be kidding me.

631
00:30:49,175 --> 00:30:51,142
It's not your break.

632
00:30:53,847 --> 00:30:57,382
So what? You, uh... you gonna report me?

633
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:00,051
Answer a question, maybe I'll forget to.

634
00:31:02,088 --> 00:31:03,254
What's your question?

635
00:31:03,323 --> 00:31:05,123
You trying to fuck that librarian?

636
00:31:05,191 --> 00:31:06,057
No!

637
00:31:06,126 --> 00:31:07,925
I saw you. You want to fuck her.

638
00:31:07,994 --> 00:31:09,427
You want to lick her butthole, huh?

639
00:31:09,496 --> 00:31:10,895
Whoa, Jesus, no!

640
00:31:10,964 --> 00:31:12,864
Then why are you scamming her so hard

641
00:31:12,932 --> 00:31:15,733
that I nearly blew you?

642
00:31:15,802 --> 00:31:17,235
I just need her name, okay?

643
00:31:17,303 --> 00:31:19,103
Oh, why didn't you ask? Here.

644
00:31:21,975 --> 00:31:24,575
The "S" stands for Shot,
or maybe it's Schiff.

645
00:31:24,644 --> 00:31:26,277
Let me know if you find
anything gross in her book.

646
00:31:26,346 --> 00:31:28,312
I have a feeling she's a total
freak in the sack.

647
00:31:28,381 --> 00:31:29,580
Okay.

648
00:31:29,649 --> 00:31:30,948
What's your deal?

649
00:31:31,017 --> 00:31:33,718
- I have no deal.
- You're a child.

650
00:31:33,787 --> 00:31:35,053
Okay, Grandpa, that's a little...

651
00:31:35,121 --> 00:31:39,657
What are you even doing stuck here?

652
00:31:39,726 --> 00:31:42,193
What do they have on you?

653
00:31:42,262 --> 00:31:44,962
Nothing.

654
00:31:45,031 --> 00:31:46,497
Okay, fine, they're protecting me.

655
00:31:46,566 --> 00:31:49,400
Protecting you from what?

656
00:31:49,469 --> 00:31:52,170
My dad is a businessman

657
00:31:52,238 --> 00:31:54,639
and sometimes his competition
can get a little rough,

658
00:31:54,708 --> 00:31:56,040
so he sent me here.

659
00:31:56,109 --> 00:31:58,943
- Like, he's a...
- Legitimate businessman.

660
00:31:59,012 --> 00:32:00,411
Can we please not talk about it?

661
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,014
My God, you're like
that whiny little kid

662
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:05,550
in "The Sopranos," Willow.

663
00:32:05,618 --> 00:32:07,452
Jesus Christ, you are so lame.

664
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,053
Please.

665
00:32:10,523 --> 00:32:12,457
And her name was Meadow.

666
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,564
You truthied me?

667
00:32:19,632 --> 00:32:21,499
I can't lie.

668
00:32:21,568 --> 00:32:23,801
Eliot, I did this for you.

669
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:26,370
- There was no other way.
- Don't.

670
00:32:28,108 --> 00:32:30,842
You started this when you declared war.

671
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:33,778
Now my wife and child are gone.

672
00:32:33,847 --> 00:32:35,213
I need to deal with the rats.

673
00:32:35,281 --> 00:32:39,083
I can't risk having to
clean up your next mess.

674
00:32:43,757 --> 00:32:45,456
Guards.

675
00:32:45,525 --> 00:32:47,158
No, Eliot.

676
00:32:47,227 --> 00:32:50,862
- What are you doing?
- I don't know what else to do.

677
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:54,298
- Take her to the dungeon.
- No!

678
00:32:54,367 --> 00:32:56,968
Eliot...

679
00:32:57,036 --> 00:32:59,003
I'll fix this.

680
00:33:01,007 --> 00:33:04,075
Make sure she gets the best room.

681
00:33:04,144 --> 00:33:06,711
And see that she gets her coconut oil.

682
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:08,880
Good-bye, Margo.

683
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:20,124
Oh, shit!

684
00:33:42,849 --> 00:33:45,283
I know you're in there.

685
00:33:45,351 --> 00:33:46,818
Come out.

686
00:33:46,886 --> 00:33:48,753
It's okay.

687
00:33:48,822 --> 00:33:50,321
It's me.

688
00:33:55,028 --> 00:33:56,861
Oh, my God.

689
00:34:00,542 --> 00:34:03,570
Julia, I found her she's...

690
00:34:05,432 --> 00:34:06,797
Quentin.

691
00:34:08,601 --> 00:34:11,368
I missed you so much.

692
00:34:11,437 --> 00:34:14,004
Oh, my God.

693
00:34:14,073 --> 00:34:15,372
Hi.

694
00:34:19,278 --> 00:34:21,245
Are you okay?

695
00:34:21,313 --> 00:34:22,880
Yeah. Are you?

696
00:34:22,948 --> 00:34:25,449
Not really.

697
00:34:25,518 --> 00:34:27,117
Without you.

698
00:34:27,186 --> 00:34:30,053
Did you get Reynard yet?

699
00:34:30,122 --> 00:34:32,022
I'm trying.

700
00:34:40,499 --> 00:34:42,766
She talks about him all the time.

701
00:34:42,835 --> 00:34:44,835
Says he's a good guy.

702
00:34:44,904 --> 00:34:47,404
Stupid sometimes, but good.

703
00:34:50,609 --> 00:34:53,010
Is there any way
we can take her with us too?

704
00:35:06,725 --> 00:35:09,359
I know you told security to keep me out,

705
00:35:09,428 --> 00:35:11,962
but then I suggested they let me in.

706
00:35:12,031 --> 00:35:14,364
Stalemate, I guess.

707
00:35:14,433 --> 00:35:16,033
Is this about Cowden?

708
00:35:16,101 --> 00:35:18,602
I think you just
overwhelmed him a little.

709
00:35:18,671 --> 00:35:21,271
I know it's a lot, but it's worth it.

710
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,440
My wife.

711
00:35:23,509 --> 00:35:25,876
Is anything about our relationship real?

712
00:35:25,945 --> 00:35:29,213
I've been controlling her
from the day we met, right?

713
00:35:29,281 --> 00:35:31,415
Yes. Lucky her.

714
00:35:31,483 --> 00:35:33,317
How is that?

715
00:35:33,385 --> 00:35:35,085
She's a person.

716
00:35:35,154 --> 00:35:36,353
Yes.

717
00:35:36,422 --> 00:35:37,688
And you're not.

718
00:35:37,756 --> 00:35:39,456
The sooner you wrap
your head around that...

719
00:35:39,525 --> 00:35:41,692
No, no.

720
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,760
I don't want it.

721
00:35:42,828 --> 00:35:44,995
You want to be President

722
00:35:45,064 --> 00:35:47,164
of this entire idiotic country.

723
00:35:47,233 --> 00:35:49,566
You have always sensed your place.

724
00:35:49,635 --> 00:35:51,935
Julia and Kady, they said
you did terrible things.

725
00:35:52,004 --> 00:35:53,837
I should've looked you up on the spot.

726
00:35:53,906 --> 00:35:56,707
You didn't because I
gently suggested you don't.

727
00:35:56,775 --> 00:35:58,375
It's for your own good, kid.

728
00:35:58,444 --> 00:36:00,344
So it's all true.

729
00:36:00,412 --> 00:36:01,945
Those poor women.

730
00:36:02,014 --> 00:36:03,714
Those women were hardly victims.

731
00:36:03,782 --> 00:36:06,216
They said they were just
trying to summon a little help

732
00:36:06,285 --> 00:36:07,484
from some kind of goddess...

733
00:36:07,553 --> 00:36:10,754
They were summoning an evil bitch!

734
00:36:10,823 --> 00:36:12,789
You looked me up, says trickster.

735
00:36:12,858 --> 00:36:14,291
See, that's honest.

736
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,659
Yes, I fuck with the weak.

737
00:36:15,728 --> 00:36:17,327
You know what that does?
Improves the herd.

738
00:36:17,396 --> 00:36:20,063
I help the same little creatures
you want to help.

739
00:36:20,132 --> 00:36:21,732
It's not surprising, you're my son,

740
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,600
how else could it be but her?

741
00:36:23,669 --> 00:36:26,403
The benevolent "Our Lady Underground."

742
00:36:26,472 --> 00:36:28,071
It is all about her.

743
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:32,075
Power, attention, grinding men
and gods into the fucking dirt

744
00:36:32,144 --> 00:36:34,077
and then she leaves!

745
00:36:43,689 --> 00:36:47,491
You loved her.

746
00:36:47,559 --> 00:36:50,861
Guess there's some things
you can't control, after all.

747
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:54,698
I can see you're upset.

748
00:36:54,767 --> 00:36:56,533
But I need you to move past that.

749
00:36:56,602 --> 00:36:59,169
Stop worrying about humans.

750
00:36:59,238 --> 00:37:00,871
They're beneath you.

751
00:37:00,939 --> 00:37:03,674
This is your birthright, son.

752
00:37:03,742 --> 00:37:05,442
We're gonna do so much together.

753
00:37:09,381 --> 00:37:11,415
How'd you do it? You know, turn me back?

754
00:37:11,483 --> 00:37:13,116
A special Fillorian mint.

755
00:37:13,185 --> 00:37:15,786
And about 50 straight minutes
of casting,

756
00:37:15,854 --> 00:37:18,955
so I'm gonna need a minute to recharge.

757
00:37:19,024 --> 00:37:22,025
You sure you don't want
any clothes, or...

758
00:37:22,094 --> 00:37:23,527
Eh.

759
00:37:23,595 --> 00:37:24,715
Can't you get Margo to help?

760
00:37:24,763 --> 00:37:26,163
You know, give you a break?

761
00:37:26,231 --> 00:37:28,198
I kind of threw her in the dungeon.

762
00:37:28,267 --> 00:37:29,599
Got ya.

763
00:37:29,668 --> 00:37:31,568
Well, you'll run yourself dead,

764
00:37:31,637 --> 00:37:32,757
doing everything on your own.

765
00:37:32,805 --> 00:37:34,171
Believe me, I know.

766
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:36,973
Pass some shit down the chain
to the governors

767
00:37:37,042 --> 00:37:41,812
or the dukes or whatever.

768
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,381
You don't have any governors?

769
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:45,949
No dukes?

770
00:37:46,018 --> 00:37:49,453
- Get you some delegates, son.
- Right, really good idea.

771
00:37:49,521 --> 00:37:51,988
Select governors.

772
00:37:52,057 --> 00:37:53,957
Yet another task for the High King.

773
00:37:54,026 --> 00:37:56,626
Or you just hold an election.

774
00:37:56,695 --> 00:38:00,731
Let the people pick their own,
you do nada.

775
00:38:00,799 --> 00:38:02,132
- That's...
- Stupid, is it stupid?

776
00:38:02,201 --> 00:38:03,900
- I'm sorry.
- Brilliant, Josh.

777
00:38:03,969 --> 00:38:06,803
I think you just invented democracy,

778
00:38:06,872 --> 00:38:08,672
and it's going to save Fillory.

779
00:38:08,741 --> 00:38:11,274
Well, high five, brother.

780
00:38:15,848 --> 00:38:19,116
- Eliot?
- What the hell?

781
00:38:20,953 --> 00:38:24,321
Dude, I thought you were
off being, like,

782
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:26,490
the High King of Fillory?

783
00:38:26,558 --> 00:38:28,859
I am.

784
00:38:28,927 --> 00:38:31,528
I was.

785
00:38:31,597 --> 00:38:33,932
I think I just got kicked out.

786
00:38:43,778 --> 00:38:45,945
Of course her book is relocated

787
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:48,114
to the Poison Room.

788
00:38:48,149 --> 00:38:49,482
Okay.

789
00:38:49,517 --> 00:38:51,350
So what's our next move?

790
00:38:51,386 --> 00:38:52,919
Admit I'm fucking cursed?

791
00:38:52,954 --> 00:38:53,920
Is this all you guys do?

792
00:38:53,955 --> 00:38:55,354
Talk about your fee-fees?

793
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:57,823
I was kind of hoping
you'd get to fucking.

794
00:38:57,859 --> 00:38:59,192
How did you...

795
00:38:59,227 --> 00:39:01,894
Oh, hopped into your mind
when you hopped into hers.

796
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:03,462
It's a little trick
my dad's friends taught me.

797
00:39:03,498 --> 00:39:06,532
Your dad's friends are perverts?

798
00:39:06,568 --> 00:39:08,167
Thugs. Magic mobsters.

799
00:39:08,203 --> 00:39:09,268
- No, they're not.
- Jesus.

800
00:39:09,304 --> 00:39:10,536
Which is why I'm leaving.

801
00:39:10,572 --> 00:39:12,738
- So's Willow.
- Meadow, doofus.

802
00:39:12,774 --> 00:39:13,739
Fine, kick me out.

803
00:39:13,775 --> 00:39:15,341
You really don't need my help.

804
00:39:15,376 --> 00:39:16,676
Help with what?

805
00:39:16,711 --> 00:39:19,245
Trying to break into the Poison Room.

806
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,847
I've been in your crappy Nolan
movie for, like, 20 minutes.

807
00:39:21,883 --> 00:39:23,282
I heard everything.

808
00:39:23,318 --> 00:39:24,817
Been trying to get in there
myself, 'cause, you know,

809
00:39:24,852 --> 00:39:26,586
I'm curious about a few things.

810
00:39:26,621 --> 00:39:28,554
So you can either start from
square one on your own,

811
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:31,791
or you can hop the line and join...

812
00:39:33,328 --> 00:39:35,194
Well, the pervy mob girl has a point.

813
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:37,330
No. It's dangerous.

814
00:39:37,365 --> 00:39:39,899
You know what's safe? Nothing.

815
00:39:39,934 --> 00:39:41,467
You're not responsible for me, okay?

816
00:39:41,502 --> 00:39:45,037
Free will, I exercise that shit.

817
00:39:45,073 --> 00:39:46,138
I'm gonna hate this.

818
00:39:46,174 --> 00:39:47,573
You hate everything.

819
00:39:47,609 --> 00:39:49,875
That's why I like you.

820
00:39:49,911 --> 00:39:52,478
Kady. Kady!

821
00:39:52,513 --> 00:39:54,447
Kady, wake up.

822
00:39:57,185 --> 00:39:58,918
- Kady.
- Hey.

823
00:39:58,953 --> 00:40:02,421
- What?
- Hey, you, uh, you got a guest.

824
00:40:03,725 --> 00:40:06,626
Professor Lipson told me
to bring him here.

825
00:40:10,365 --> 00:40:12,832
If you're still after Reynard,

826
00:40:12,867 --> 00:40:14,800
I want in.

827
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,539
Eliot?

828
00:40:23,111 --> 00:40:24,577
Oh, you.

829
00:40:24,612 --> 00:40:27,513
I shouldn't be here, but...

830
00:40:29,651 --> 00:40:32,184
Please. Your Majesty.

831
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,787
- Be careful.
- So not a nice scotch, then?

832
00:40:34,822 --> 00:40:39,158
It will transport you
to the fairy realm.

833
00:40:39,193 --> 00:40:42,561
I must warn you, few return.

834
00:40:42,597 --> 00:40:45,898
But it is a chance to save Fen,

835
00:40:45,933 --> 00:40:48,234
the baby.

836
00:40:48,269 --> 00:40:49,802
I would go, but...

837
00:40:49,837 --> 00:40:52,305
You're a pussy who's in love
with a sloth,

838
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,640
who's currently a rat.

839
00:40:54,676 --> 00:40:58,577
And end of the day,
it's my mess to clean up.

840
00:40:58,613 --> 00:41:00,646
Tell Eliot that.

841
00:41:10,458 --> 00:41:12,425
Q, it's time.

842
00:41:14,429 --> 00:41:16,529
This is it.

843
00:41:16,564 --> 00:41:18,197
It's who I couldn't make the math work.

844
00:41:18,232 --> 00:41:19,432
What math?

845
00:41:19,467 --> 00:41:21,067
Uh, the spell to bring Alice back.

846
00:41:21,102 --> 00:41:23,302
I knew something was missing,
I just didn't know...

847
00:41:23,338 --> 00:41:27,340
It was me.

848
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:29,075
You have to go now.

849
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:31,077
There's a portal in there,

850
00:41:31,112 --> 00:41:32,978
back to reception.

851
00:41:33,014 --> 00:41:35,281
And I'm glad we got to say good-bye.

852
00:41:38,786 --> 00:41:41,554
Um, I'm gonna be back here
for good one day,

853
00:41:41,589 --> 00:41:44,957
and I am going to find you.

854
00:41:48,963 --> 00:41:50,496
Okay.

855
00:41:59,974 --> 00:42:01,273
You first.

856
00:42:20,995 --> 00:42:23,896
- Jules, what the hell?
- This isn't up for debate.

857
00:42:23,931 --> 00:42:25,431
We came here so that you could...

858
00:42:25,466 --> 00:42:27,433
Yeah? So?

859
00:42:27,468 --> 00:42:29,435
Things change.

860
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:31,103
- If you do this...
- I know.

861
00:42:31,139 --> 00:42:32,972
This is my one shot.

862
00:42:33,007 --> 00:42:34,740
And this is what I want to do with it.

863
00:42:34,776 --> 00:42:36,709
I found them! Stop!

864
00:42:36,744 --> 00:42:38,010
Come on, or we'll lose her, too.

865
00:42:38,045 --> 00:42:39,412
You can't take that Shade!

866
00:42:39,447 --> 00:42:41,480
Hey! Stop!

867
00:42:41,516 --> 00:42:44,016
It's all going to be okay, Quentin.

868
00:42:44,051 --> 00:42:49,051
