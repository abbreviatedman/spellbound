1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:02,894
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:04,796
<i>My hands won't cast.</i>

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,029
We can help you, Penny.

4
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:07,435
What's the catch?

5
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:10,876
Bound in service to the
Library up to and after my death?

6
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:13,056
<i>That isn't just any door.</i>
PENNY: <i>Then what is it?</i>

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,275
The Poison Room.

8
00:00:14,381 --> 00:00:15,747
There is knowledge
behind that door

9
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:17,293
that could destroy
more than just people.

10
00:00:17,317 --> 00:00:18,751
It could destroy worlds.

11
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:20,515
<i>The Ars Deicidium?</i>

12
00:00:20,587 --> 00:00:22,146
The art of killing gods.

13
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:24,724
King Idri is our honored guest.

14
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:25,992
We're getting married.

15
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:28,628
One big royal
polyamorous family.

16
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,687
The Fairies can bring
back the Wellspring?

17
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:31,764
They can.

18
00:00:31,832 --> 00:00:33,027
And in return?

19
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,093
<i>The child that grows in the
womb of the High King's wife.</i>

20
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:39,796
<i>Some friends and I
summoned a goddess.</i>

21
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,209
You may address me as Reynard
the Fox, trickster of the very stupid.

22
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:47,281
Reynard's son is John Gaines?

23
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:48,747
My son.

24
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:52,581
<i>Jules, I talked to your Shade.</i>

25
00:00:52,653 --> 00:00:53,848
She's not gone.

26
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:55,114
So where is she?

27
00:00:55,522 --> 00:00:57,388
Shades go to the Underworld.

28
00:00:57,591 --> 00:01:00,493
The living can access the Underworld
with the help of a Gatekeeper.

29
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:01,620
An Ancient One.

30
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:04,755
I think I figured out
what an Ancient One is.

31
00:01:10,571 --> 00:01:12,938
Look, Q, you don't
have to come with me.

32
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:15,271
In fact, I don't think
that you should.

33
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:18,640
Noted, but I'm coming.

34
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:20,512
You feel the energy
coming off that?

35
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:23,882
Yeah, also the stink.

36
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:30,280
I don't know. My ancient
Greek is a little rusty.

37
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,658
"The old reveals itself to the
new at the fall of milk teeth."

38
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:37,588
Milk teeth?

39
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:39,497
Oh, uh, baby teeth.

40
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:42,468
You think we have to
stick one in to open it up?

41
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:43,832
I mean, I could write a spell.

42
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:46,100
Uh, we could find the
nearest child's house

43
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:47,573
expecting the
tooth fairy, and...

44
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:48,904
Break in and steal their teeth?

45
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:51,909
I'd leave money.

46
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:55,692
I hate to bring this
up, but I actually...

47
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,378
I still have one.

48
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:58,850
A molar that never came in.

49
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,615
Oh! I know an extraction spell.

50
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:01,914
Ah!

51
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:03,457
Fuck. Sorry.

52
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:09,019
This dragon better
be fucking cool.

53
00:02:16,036 --> 00:02:17,036
Hmm...

54
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:20,396
Or not?

55
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:39,952
I wouldn't have
guessed baby teeth.

56
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:42,153
Why would a dragon
want baby teeth?

57
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:43,322
Shit.

58
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:48,802
I collect baby teeth, as I collect
many things, little mammal.

59
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:56,272
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

60
00:02:56,343 --> 00:03:01,008
"Your Ladyship"? I am a
Queen of the Great Worms.

61
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:03,277
Of course you are.

62
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,546
That's awesome. I wasn't
suggesting that you weren't.

63
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:08,453
Your manner does not
endear me to you, human.

64
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,459
We seek passage to the
Underworld, O Ancient One.

65
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:20,431
Hmm, you seek to die?

66
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,904
Uh, no, actually we were
hoping to come back after.

67
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:26,005
Suit yourself.

68
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:29,101
I require a gift.

69
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:30,269
A gift? Um...

70
00:03:31,745 --> 00:03:34,840
Yeah. I mean, name it,
and we'll get it for you.

71
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,442
You already have it.

72
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,944
It's in your pocket.

73
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:50,655
No. Pick something else.

74
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,757
If this gets you your
Shade back... No.

75
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,028
Fillory is your home.

76
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:59,562
And what about your friends?
What if they need you? We can't.

77
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,777
Queen of the Great Worms,

78
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:07,610
what if I needed to
borrow it in the future?

79
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:08,909
Just super briefly.

80
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:13,885
No. If you wish to return home,
you must find other means.

81
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:17,891
The first door remains
open, little mammal.

82
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:22,396
Great, um, I super love riddles.

83
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,960
Are you giving me
the button or not?

84
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:43,947
Your bodies will stay here,
and your souls will travel.

85
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,645
You have 24 hours
to return to the portal.

86
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,881
Or...

87
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:50,651
I sit patiently, waiting
for you to come back.

88
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:55,019
No, I eat you. I'm a fucking
dragon. What'd you expect?

89
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,786
Great. Good to know.

90
00:04:56,897 --> 00:04:59,457
Then it's settled.

91
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,040
Jesus! A little
warning next time.

92
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:08,473
Really.

93
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,512
Q, look.

94
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:14,405
Time to go.

95
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:19,987
Fucking millennials.

96
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:45,570
Welcome to the Underworld.

97
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:50,550
Please take a number.

98
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:56,222
The fuck...

99
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,541
Idri is almost here. And does
anyone know where Fen is?

100
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,947
I present King Idri of Loria.

101
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:30,554
My life is perfect.

102
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:32,625
Hello.

103
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:36,159
Josh. Wine, canapÃ©s.
I said have it ready.

104
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:39,327
We have a lovely blend of...

105
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:40,523
Okay.

106
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,863
Where are the fire dancers?

107
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,233
I don't know.

108
00:06:45,372 --> 00:06:46,704
I'm sorry. I had
a whole thing...

109
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:51,473
Your Majesty, this
presentation is beautiful, but...

110
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,589
It would be so much better
with fire dancers. I know.

111
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:56,344
I hope my arrival isn't
causing undue stress.

112
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,851
Stress? I'm not stressed.

113
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:03,084
Eliot, I don't care
about ceremony.

114
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,282
You don't? But...

115
00:07:04,357 --> 00:07:07,521
But I came here for you.

116
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:08,894
Oh...

117
00:07:11,531 --> 00:07:14,899
Well, the feeling's mutual.

118
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,271
Take me somewhere we can
become a bit better acquainted.

119
00:07:21,508 --> 00:07:22,508
Alone.

120
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:29,281
<i>Congratulations, you're dead!</i>

121
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:32,546
<i>You've passed through
the veil, to the Underworld.</i>

122
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:36,182
<i>Is this your final
destination? No.</i>

123
00:07:36,323 --> 00:07:38,155
<i>It's the first leg
of your journey.</i>

124
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:41,624
<i>We designed this part
of the Underworld for you,</i>

125
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:44,023
<i>based on your life and
personal expectations</i>

126
00:07:44,097 --> 00:07:46,931
<i>to facilitate a
comfortable transition.</i>

127
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,464
<i>You've been grouped with others
who have similar expectations.</i>

128
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:52,204
<i>Perfect, right?</i>

129
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:54,704
<i>This is your time
to process...</i> Ow.

130
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:55,774
What?

131
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,969
<i>And settle into this next
stage of your existence.</i>

132
00:07:58,578 --> 00:08:00,706
<i>In the unlikely event
you're missing your Shade,</i>

133
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,840
<i>please report to a
bellhop immediately.</i>

134
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,950
<i>Enjoy your wait.</i>

135
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:10,833
I guess we need
to find bellhops.

136
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:12,689
Security! We have
a Shadeless patron.

137
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:13,836
What? BELLHOP: Take him away.

138
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,860
Why? Where are you taking
me? Thank you. Thank you.

139
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,828
Read me my rights.
Let go. Wait... Ow!

140
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,935
Or, you know, we take a beat.

141
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,667
173.

142
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:27,733
173.

143
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:31,244
Place your hands on the
counter for identification, please.

144
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:37,347
Hey, do you know where they
were taking that guy just now?

145
00:08:37,417 --> 00:08:41,081
Oh, his soul is
missing a little piece.

146
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:43,953
They just took him somewhere
where he would be more comfortable.

147
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,549
So he could be reunited with it?

148
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:47,490
I doubt it. That's
very difficult to do,

149
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,722
especially after a
prolonged separation.

150
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:50,873
Yeah, but you can't just take...

151
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,264
I assure you, all
the Shades are safe

152
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,928
and well protected
for their eternity.

153
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:57,732
Nothing to worry over.

154
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:01,603
Ah, here we are.
Wicker and Coldwater.

155
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:02,975
Oh.

156
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:04,801
Oh, my...

157
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,580
What?

158
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,642
You've both died 39 times?

159
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:13,776
No. A-ha!

160
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:18,390
Time loop. Thought so. Our
computers do not handle these well.

161
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:21,025
This will take
a bit to sort out.

162
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:23,721
Once you're in the
system, we'll reunite you

163
00:09:23,797 --> 00:09:25,766
with your immediate
karmic circle,

164
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:28,310
but until then, I'll need to stick
you somewhere. Do you like skiing?

165
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:31,133
Look, I thought this was just a
way station? We're kind of in a hurry.

166
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:35,266
Oh, it is, but souls
do stay a while

167
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,001
until they're ready to

168
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,239
move on.

169
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,171
Snorkeling? Art museums?

170
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,842
Actually, is it possible to
check on a few names?

171
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,286
I think I might have a
karmic circle we could visit.

172
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,940
You're making progress.

173
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:00,661
Am I? Nothing's happening.

174
00:10:01,501 --> 00:10:04,096
It's an exceedingly
difficult way to do magic,

175
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:07,401
trying to isolate muscles not
generally associated with...

176
00:10:07,507 --> 00:10:10,067
Call it what it is.
Sphincter magic.

177
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,779
Gets me there? No shame.

178
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:16,210
And if it doesn't, we all
need a healthy pelvic floor.

179
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,582
Now, I'm afraid study time
is over. I have your next job.

180
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:21,521
Re-shelving books.

181
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:22,681
Great.

182
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,690
Any questions, direct them to...

183
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:27,059
Where'd she go? Sylvia!

184
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,559
What? Shh!

185
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:36,300
Penny, Sylvia. Sylvia, Penny.

186
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:39,396
So what, I'm babysitting now?

187
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:42,405
Oh, no, Sylvia is
your supervisor.

188
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,273
Good luck! I'll check back.

189
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:49,079
Nice scarf.

190
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:54,978
Anyway, I married
Fen because I had to.

191
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:58,220
I didn't know her at all.

192
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:01,051
And now,

193
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:03,424
I don't know you.

194
00:11:05,398 --> 00:11:09,494
My wife used to say there's one
way to learn to be with another person.

195
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,838
The hard way?

196
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:14,373
Actually, yes.

197
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,170
Stand up.

198
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:25,182
Would you mind removing this?

199
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,721
Buttons, too, please.

200
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,689
What are you doing? Shh.

201
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:41,960
This is a lesson.

202
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,470
All of them.

203
00:11:47,774 --> 00:11:48,774
Please.

204
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,977
I really hate to bring this up,

205
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,482
but you do realize

206
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,711
there's nothing
we can actually do.

207
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,184
Oh, I know.

208
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:04,624
And yet there's so
much we can do.

209
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,794
I can't touch you.

210
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,289
You can't touch me.

211
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:14,358
But I can tell you how
I want to touch you.

212
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:18,899
And you can show me
how you like to be touched.

213
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:23,340
I admire your
commitment to education.

214
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,911
If you're waiting for
my permission, don't.

215
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:40,652
What the fuck?

216
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:44,396
Eliot, Heloise just
turned into a rat!

217
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,765
What was that?

218
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:51,902
I'm not getting
laid tonight, am I?

219
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:56,836
This is all of them?

220
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:58,343
We can't be sure.

221
00:12:58,411 --> 00:12:59,572
So many people have vanished,

222
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,566
and there are so many
rats in the castle already.

223
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:04,443
Well, one of them has to be Fen.

224
00:13:04,717 --> 00:13:08,085
Okay, bottom-line it for me,
what the fuck is going on?

225
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:11,885
I'm sorry, Your Highness, but,
this magic, I've never seen it before.

226
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:15,190
Abigail? If you can
hear me, squeak.

227
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,786
Let me know you're okay.

228
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:20,691
Why didn't I study how
to speak rat in school?

229
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,703
Okay. Search the
castle. Find every rat.

230
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:29,573
And then council meeting,
or what's left of the council.

231
00:13:50,063 --> 00:13:52,157
What do we call that? Mmm.

232
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:54,458
In-sex-tion?

233
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:58,494
Inter-cepti-course?

234
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,403
Incepti-sex?

235
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,601
"Incepti-sex."

236
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:04,803
I like that.

237
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:09,141
That said, I like
real life better.

238
00:14:09,248 --> 00:14:10,248
Mmm.

239
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:14,744
But at least, this way, we
don't have to get up for beers.

240
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,251
Thank you.

241
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,462
So no pressure,

242
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:31,296
but any word on the Poison Room?

243
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:35,071
Believe me, I wanna get in
there. It's above my pay grade.

244
00:14:35,641 --> 00:14:37,132
I need a code to get in.

245
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,710
Well, what about that Librarian?

246
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:42,043
Oh, man, if she has the code, it is
locked down tighter than a nun's pussy.

247
00:14:42,148 --> 00:14:43,446
Right, of course it is.

248
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:47,310
Hey, does she
have a book of her?

249
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:49,855
Everyone has a book.

250
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:51,881
You're thinking...

251
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:54,553
I mean, if the room
is that important...

252
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,493
It's in her book.

253
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,087
Okay.

254
00:14:58,498 --> 00:14:59,864
I can work on that.

255
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,365
Hey, what's up with the senator?

256
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,097
He went back to work.

257
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,662
He made up some bullshit
excuse about the kidnapping.

258
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:08,271
All the news outlets bought it.

259
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,441
But hey, get this.

260
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,336
I saw Reynard in the
back of a press photo

261
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,848
in a suit, like an
advisor or something.

262
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:16,915
Are you kidding me?

263
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:19,583
He's a trickster.

264
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:21,849
Guess that includes his own son.

265
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,219
Jesus Christ.

266
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:26,423
We can't get one more vote?

267
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:28,791
We're in touch with
Matthews, Bauer, Wheeler.

268
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,006
Just give them a couple days.
They'll come to their senses.

269
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,623
Call in Senator Cowden.

270
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:34,257
Why bother? He won't budge.

271
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:35,767
We can change his mind.

272
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:37,235
Trust me. How?

273
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,634
Everyone, give us a minute.

274
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:48,639
So they're taking
your orders now?

275
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,710
Have been for a while.
I controlled their minds,

276
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,786
just like you have
many, many times.

277
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,475
I don't know what
you're talking about.

278
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,491
You know you have that power.

279
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:02,119
You've been using
it your whole life.

280
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:07,233
I always thought I had some
kind of god-level good luck.

281
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:13,503
True, you've only used it
instinctively, but I'm here now.

282
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:16,202
I can teach you how
to use it at will. Easy.

283
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,502
And once you've mastered it,

284
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:21,480
that's how you
get Cowden's vote.

285
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:24,714
I don't know that I wanna
do that. It feels like cheating.

286
00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:26,480
They all don't cheat?

287
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:28,746
Everyone uses whatever
they've got, John,

288
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,813
and the bad ones don't hesitate.

289
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,955
So someone like you,
someone who wants to do

290
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:36,086
some actual good in the world,

291
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:37,595
how can you not?

292
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:41,162
Here's all you have to do.

293
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,560
Look at me.

294
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:49,637
You look him straight in
the eye, and you tell him,

295
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:52,136
plainly, directly.

296
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,513
That's it?

297
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:57,474
It's that simple.

298
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:00,744
Good luck with the
meeting, Senator.

299
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,043
Why would anyone
want their afterlife

300
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:17,593
to look like a terrible
middle-school birthday party?

301
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,104
Is this about your incident?

302
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:21,140
I've moved on. Have you?

303
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:22,698
Julia? Julia!

304
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,504
Julia! Oh, my God! Welcome!

305
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:26,102
Julia! Welcome!

306
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,670
Where's Bender? Is he okay?

307
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:30,273
He's great. He moved on.

308
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:32,944
Uh, who's your friend,
and what's his shoe size?

309
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:35,045
We're not really here to bowl.

310
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:38,818
Kid, the first rule of being
dead. If you're here, you bowl.

311
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,491
We're actually not dead, either.

312
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,937
Uh, we're here because
we need your help.

313
00:17:41,961 --> 00:17:43,088
Julia?

314
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:51,970
What?

315
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:57,735
Nothing. It's good to see
you, Richard. The real you.

316
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,903
The real me? What happened?

317
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:04,316
I need your help. I
need to find my Shade.

318
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:05,917
Okay.

319
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:10,823
The Underworld is massive.

320
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,017
There's every ecosystem.
Nearest we can tell,

321
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,153
about 2,000 islands
built to look like Hawaii.

322
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:17,628
And you went with
the bowling alley?

323
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,863
And the powers that
be are into whatever

324
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:23,334
helps us settle in, so
that we can move on.

325
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:24,927
Yeah!

326
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:27,285
Yes! JULIA: Powers that be?

327
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:29,933
Yeah, gods. We were
right about them being real.

328
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:33,138
Hades created the Underworld,
runs it with his wife, Persephone.

329
00:18:33,212 --> 00:18:35,738
They live in a big
house way over here.

330
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:38,284
It's a beautiful
area called Elysium.

331
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:40,512
Apparently, they used to
come and go like clockwork,

332
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,214
every fall and spring,

333
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,484
but, a while back,
they just disappeared.

334
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:46,549
Wait. Why are you
doing all this, Richard?

335
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:50,026
I know you. This is a project.

336
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:51,357
I'm trying to find my son.

337
00:18:51,998 --> 00:18:54,399
I don't know where he
is, if he's even still here,

338
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,060
but he's got to be somewhere,

339
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,331
and they won't tell
me a damn thing.

340
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,401
Why not?

341
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:04,004
I'm flagged as
culpable in his death.

342
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:05,772
There are rules.

343
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:08,479
And friends to
help me break them.

344
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,410
Okay, so wait. So where
do they keep the Shades?

345
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,113
Sorry, we don't know that yet.

346
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,220
So we're flying blind?

347
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:17,518
Hon, you're gonna have to bowl.

348
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,470
No, look, I had an incident when I
was a kid. My fingers got stuck and...

349
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,858
Oh, get over it.
Your girl would.

350
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:23,972
She's not my girl.

351
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,056
No shit. She's tough as granite,

352
00:19:26,132 --> 00:19:28,431
and you're afraid to bowl.

353
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:29,801
Fine.

354
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:38,069
How long before the
dragon eats you and Quentin?

355
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:39,635
Tomorrow morning.

356
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:43,014
Always the one to tell the
impossible to go fuck itself, huh?

357
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,641
Yeah, well, it
doesn't always listen.

358
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:48,830
They'll know where the
Shades are kept at reception.

359
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,187
I don't know. They
didn't seem too keen

360
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:53,089
on helping out a person
who looked like this.

361
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:55,527
Shit.

362
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,927
It seems to be closing
up much faster down here.

363
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,959
Okay, so we hurry, but
just... Not for nothing,

364
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,645
reception isn't keen to
help much of anyone.

365
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:05,714
I can't count the number of
times I've been kicked out of there,

366
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:07,673
trying to find my little boy.

367
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:10,242
Whoo! I have an idea.

368
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:13,869
Oh, my God.
Julia! I got a strike.

369
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,076
Yeah, Q!

370
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:18,875
The thing about the
Underworld is, the first week,

371
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:20,852
it's always a strike.

372
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:24,654
Let him have this one.

373
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:28,389
Whoo! Go, Q!

374
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,024
You wanted to talk?

375
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:38,434
You lying son of a bitch.

376
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:42,401
You turned Fen into a rat
along with half the castle.

377
00:20:42,475 --> 00:20:45,468
Fen is in her human
form in the Fairy Realm,

378
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:48,977
and she was taken because you
tried to get clever with our deal.

379
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:52,348
So you turn half my
staff into snake food?

380
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,818
That wasn't the Fairies. Huh.

381
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,884
Well, it sure smells like
their whimsical bullshit.

382
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:00,653
"Whimsical"?

383
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:03,360
It's the mark of the
stupid and the arrogant

384
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,762
to attack what you
can't comprehend.

385
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,227
Fine.

386
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:08,927
Get it out of your system.

387
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:12,062
Then, if you know what's
going on, just tell me.

388
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:17,409
I take it back. You're
not entirely simpleminded.

389
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:21,738
There's another power which you've
made the mistake of overlooking.

390
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:24,016
You wanna be specific or not?

391
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,779
A power without logic.

392
00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:29,451
A power that acts, not for
gain but solely because it can.

393
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:32,219
That's the true danger.

394
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:36,156
Face that, or face the
end of your kingdom.

395
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:47,739
Uh, hey!

396
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,568
I got a question for you.

397
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,339
Of course. How can I help?

398
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:55,047
You know, I never got your name.

399
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:59,210
You may call me Head Librarian.

400
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,257
And, uh, what do I get to
call you outside of work?

401
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:07,688
I see what you're getting at.

402
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,394
But intra-office courtship
is expressly prohibited.

403
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,265
I'm flattered, but
rules are rules.

404
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,800
Are they?

405
00:22:14,934 --> 00:22:15,934
Always?

406
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:23,041
Penny, please don't take it
personally, but you're not my type.

407
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:25,809
You're a touch
emotionally insecure,

408
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:27,813
for which you compensate heavily

409
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,940
with boisterousness
and foul language.

410
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,385
I'm here if you
need anything else.

411
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:48,362
Hey, guys!

412
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:51,437
Mr. Corrigan. Mr. Corrigan,
you have no need to be in here.

413
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:52,981
Just a couple of questions.
I'm gonna take a number.

414
00:22:53,005 --> 00:22:54,303
Please, sir.

415
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,251
You know what? I'm gonna
take a couple of numbers

416
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:58,301
just in case I don't
hear the first number.

417
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:00,343
Yeah, wow, you guys
got a lot of numbers.

418
00:23:00,446 --> 00:23:01,723
Now, Mr. Corrigan,
I beseech you.

419
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:03,682
No. Does this thing
run out of numbers?

420
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:05,460
There we go. Play time
is over, Mr. Corrigan.

421
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:06,728
I'm not playing. I
really have questions.

422
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,963
Quite the jokester, you are.

423
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:09,546
That is it. Look, security!

424
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:11,022
Don't call security, Thomas.

425
00:23:11,123 --> 00:23:12,716
Security! Oh, no! Security.

426
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:13,986
They're on their way.

427
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,237
No, no, no. I'm just
getting a number here.

428
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:16,504
Ha-ha. Very funny, Mr. Corrigan.

429
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:18,360
Does this thing
run out of numbers?

430
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:20,091
It's locked.

431
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:25,534
"Disconnected Shade." Where?

432
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:27,834
It doesn't say. Just says, "E."

433
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:32,305
Here's another one.
"Disconnected Shade, E."

434
00:23:32,378 --> 00:23:34,210
"E." They all say "E."

435
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:37,105
Elysium. Yes.

436
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:39,978
Okay, great, the complete
opposite end of the Underworld.

437
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,664
Guys, I'm just... Take him
away for disciplinary processing.

438
00:23:42,688 --> 00:23:44,213
Thank you. There's
no need, guys.

439
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,350
Okay, you got me.

440
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:49,520
Hope you had some fun to
make your confinement worthwhile.

441
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:52,030
Aw, what's a few
weeks out of eternity?

442
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:02,306
This is books, for school kids.

443
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:06,334
If it's so important, finding
me that $5 mil can't be too hard.

444
00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:07,744
I'm not adding
another amendment.

445
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:11,909
You invited me in. You knew
what you were getting into.

446
00:24:12,885 --> 00:24:14,148
Right.

447
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:25,325
You're going to
support this bill.

448
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:29,364
In fact, your "yes" will
be the first vote cast.

449
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:36,375
John, this bill should have
been passed a long time ago.

450
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:39,244
And I'm sorry for trying to
drag you into the ditch on this.

451
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:41,036
You have my vote.

452
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,807
And I thank you for your help.

453
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:48,045
You all right?

454
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:53,422
Let me get you some water.

455
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:56,155
I must've stood up too fast.

456
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,922
Here you go.

457
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,796
I need a minute.

458
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:04,926
Becca. Becca! Get the
doctor. Get the doctor, now!

459
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:10,633
John, I'm sorry,

460
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:12,589
but I think you're
overestimating yourself here.

461
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:15,842
No, honey, I am
being 100% literal.

462
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,809
I am not human, Cindy.

463
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:20,512
And I know it sounds
ridiculous, but it is true.

464
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:23,885
Okay. I think that you have
been working too hard...

465
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:25,787
No, I haven't. I haven't.

466
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:31,120
I am telling you the truth
because you are the one I trust.

467
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,028
You are the only one, really.

468
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:37,335
And I really just need your
support right now, babe.

469
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,507
Of course, honey.

470
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:44,233
I apologize.

471
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,206
I know that you
always find a way

472
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,475
to do the right thing,
and I am here for you,

473
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:51,383
whatever you need.

474
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:57,888
Now, come on, let's go home.

475
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:28,752
It's like a Shade orphanage.

476
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:32,153
We should hurry. We're running
out of time. We should split up.

477
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:36,823
I kind of have a thing about splitting
up in houses full of creepy kids.

478
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:47,839
Hey, can we ask you a question?

479
00:26:47,906 --> 00:26:49,067
Sure.

480
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:51,439
What was that that you
just did with the money?

481
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:53,405
For the little boy?

482
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,779
What little boy? The little
boy with the shitty dad.

483
00:26:57,516 --> 00:27:00,486
He ran away, and now
he's cold and hungry.

484
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,281
He'll find it on the
sidewalk any minute.

485
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:06,653
And that's...

486
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:10,127
She's in a hospital room.
She's making them bloom.

487
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:12,897
It's a really obvious
miracle, but that's okay.

488
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:15,294
The girl in the room
is gonna die anyways.

489
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,569
So you're all making miracles?

490
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,532
Just little tiny ones, though.

491
00:27:19,605 --> 00:27:21,437
Cool. Um...

492
00:27:22,174 --> 00:27:25,008
We were looking for a
Shade. Her name's Julia.

493
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:28,673
Yeah. She looks
like her, kind of.

494
00:27:29,348 --> 00:27:31,579
And... Well, she's
a... She's a mess.

495
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,514
We all were when we got here.

496
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,844
Anything else? Um...

497
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:38,589
She's brave and funny,

498
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,956
and she probably made
friends with some of the

499
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:42,961
most shy, maladjusted Shades.

500
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:45,964
She's curious, and she
won't take "no" for an answer.

501
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,295
Are you looking for
the kind of new one

502
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:51,837
who's always getting in trouble

503
00:27:51,937 --> 00:27:53,997
and sneaking into Ms.
Persephone's room?

504
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:55,438
Because, you know, we're never

505
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:56,867
supposed to go in there.

506
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,941
Yeah. Yeah, that
does sound like her.

507
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:02,405
I just saw her. This way.

508
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,920
Up those stairs, last door.

509
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,325
Eugene? Yeah?

510
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:15,758
Who's that?

511
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:17,295
That's Ms. Persephone.

512
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:21,766
She hasn't been here for a really long
time, and no one knows where she is.

513
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,933
Thank you so much
for all your help.

514
00:28:30,676 --> 00:28:32,702
That's Our Lady Underground.

515
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:36,204
What? The one that you...

516
00:28:44,122 --> 00:28:46,455
So you were real all along, huh?

517
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:48,993
Just completely AWOL.

518
00:28:50,162 --> 00:28:52,222
Self-centered bitch.

519
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:57,293
We were so stupid to love you.

520
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:01,396
Jules, I'm sorry.

521
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:02,735
For what?

522
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:05,339
Look, I'm glad I know.

523
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:09,939
It's always better to
know, Q. You keep watch.

524
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:13,616
I'm gonna sneak in and find the
part of me that already snuck in.

525
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:15,253
Hmm.

526
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:22,417
We're under attack.

527
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:26,592
The Rattening. Now
reports of upside down rain?

528
00:29:26,665 --> 00:29:29,931
Correct. As well as
anthills turning to volcanoes,

529
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:32,197
the Balmy Sea turning to acid,

530
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:34,467
and the mysterious disappearance

531
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:37,168
of all blondes in the
province of Crickety Cove.

532
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:40,610
The talking-animals report.
This includes palomino horses.

533
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:43,181
Also, every chicken
in Fillory has laryngitis.

534
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:46,380
Is there a pattern
to any of this?

535
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:50,713
None that we can tell. Only
that whatever it is, it is increasing.

536
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:53,691
Idri's turned into a rat,
so it isn't the Lorians.

537
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:56,126
We've incapacitated
the FU Fighters.

538
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:59,790
That leaves the
people in this room.

539
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:03,961
Your Highness?

540
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,370
If anyone has anything to say...

541
00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:08,339
I'm embezzling funds
from the royal treasury.

542
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:10,205
Why did I just say that? Ha!

543
00:30:10,275 --> 00:30:12,540
Because there's truth
serum in this wine.

544
00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:14,636
I've truthied you.

545
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:17,405
Anyone else?

546
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:21,715
Abigail and I have been using the
castle guards to run an escort service.

547
00:30:21,787 --> 00:30:23,050
Gross.

548
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:24,714
Clever.

549
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,388
Doesn't help us.

550
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,056
Should have made this stronger.

551
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:32,563
It was me.

552
00:30:38,904 --> 00:30:42,341
I made a deal with the Fairies,
and I know where Fen is.

553
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:49,881
You've got to be kidding me.

554
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:51,943
It's not your break.

555
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:58,286
So, what, you, uh,
gonna report me?

556
00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:01,159
Answer a question,
maybe I'll forget to.

557
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:04,862
What's your question?

558
00:31:04,963 --> 00:31:06,488
You trying to fuck
that Librarian?

559
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:07,598
No.

560
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:08,895
I saw you.

561
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:10,945
You wanna fuck her. You
wanna lick her butthole, huh?

562
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:12,369
Oh, Jesus, no!

563
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:16,169
Then why are you scamming
her so hard that I nearly blew you?

564
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:18,807
I just need her name. Okay?

565
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,402
Oh, why didn't you ask? Here.

566
00:31:23,582 --> 00:31:26,211
The "S" stands for "Shot,"
or maybe it's "Schiff."

567
00:31:26,485 --> 00:31:28,062
Let me know if you find
anything gross in her book.

568
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:29,764
I have a feeling she's
a total freak in the sack.

569
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:31,848
Okay, what's your deal?

570
00:31:32,691 --> 00:31:34,455
I have no deal. You're a child.

571
00:31:35,494 --> 00:31:36,838
Okay, grandpa,
that's a little bit...

572
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:39,661
What are you even
doing stuck here?

573
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,595
What do they have on you?

574
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,568
Nothing.

575
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,891
Okay, fine. They're
protecting me.

576
00:31:47,973 --> 00:31:49,236
Protecting you from what?

577
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:53,605
My dad is a businessman,

578
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:56,079
and sometimes, his
competition can get a little rough,

579
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:57,172
so he sent me here.

580
00:31:57,883 --> 00:32:00,318
Like, he's a...
Legitimate businessman.

581
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,196
Can we please not talk about it?

582
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:06,817
My God, you're like that whiny
little kid in <i>The Sopranos.</i> Willow.

583
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:09,721
Jesus Christ! You
are so lame. Please.

584
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:13,622
And her name was Meadow.

585
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:20,865
You truthied me.

586
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:22,573
I can't lie.

587
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:26,712
Eliot, I did this for you.
There was no other way.

588
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:27,905
Don't.

589
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:32,284
You started this when
you declared war.

590
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:35,248
Now, my wife and child are gone.

591
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,683
I need to deal with the rats.

592
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:40,121
I can't risk having to
clean up your next mess.

593
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:46,330
Guards.

594
00:32:47,032 --> 00:32:49,695
No, Eliot, what are you doing?

595
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:51,202
I don't know what else to do.

596
00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:54,300
Take her to the dungeon. No!

597
00:32:55,774 --> 00:32:56,833
Eliot.

598
00:32:58,577 --> 00:32:59,806
I'll fix this.

599
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:04,708
Make sure she
gets the best room.

600
00:33:05,884 --> 00:33:08,046
And see that she
gets her coconut oil.

601
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:09,750
Goodbye, Margo.

602
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:21,699
Oh, shit!

603
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:45,554
I know you're in there.

604
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:48,025
Come out.

605
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:49,519
It's okay.

606
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:51,328
It's me.

607
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:58,297
Oh, my God.

608
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:05,272
Julia, I found her. She's...

609
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:08,639
Quentin.

610
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:11,774
I missed you so much.

611
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,050
Oh, my God.

612
00:34:16,021 --> 00:34:17,021
Hi.

613
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:22,485
Are you okay?

614
00:34:23,328 --> 00:34:24,694
Yeah. Are you?

615
00:34:25,697 --> 00:34:27,222
Not really,

616
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:28,532
without you.

617
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,691
Did you get Reynard yet?

618
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:33,203
I'm trying.

619
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:41,525
I missed you, too. I can't...

620
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:44,481
She talks about
him all the time.

621
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:46,040
Says he's a good guy.

622
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,418
Stupid sometimes, but good.

623
00:34:52,691 --> 00:34:54,956
Is there any way we
can take her with us, too?

624
00:35:08,974 --> 00:35:11,102
I know you told
security to keep me out,

625
00:35:11,176 --> 00:35:13,202
but then I suggested
they let me in.

626
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:15,579
Stalemate, I guess.

627
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:17,839
Is this about Cowden?

628
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,615
I think you just
overwhelmed him a little.

629
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:23,345
I know it's a lot,
but it's worth it.

630
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:24,684
My wife.

631
00:35:25,557 --> 00:35:28,026
Is anything about
our relationship real?

632
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,789
I've been controlling her
from the day we met, right?

633
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:33,163
Yes. Lucky her.

634
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:34,759
How is that?

635
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,693
She's a person.

636
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:39,262
Yes, and you're not.

637
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:41,349
The sooner you wrap
your head around that...

638
00:35:41,373 --> 00:35:43,239
No. No.

639
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:44,808
I don't want it.

640
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:49,277
You want to be President
of this entire idiotic country.

641
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:51,441
You have always
sensed your place.

642
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:52,711
Julia and Kady,

643
00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:54,150
they said you
did terrible things.

644
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:55,847
I should have looked
you up on the spot.

645
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,389
You didn't because I
gently suggested you don't.

646
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,290
It's for your own good, kid.

647
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:01,392
So it's all true.

648
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:03,589
Those poor women...

649
00:36:04,129 --> 00:36:05,722
Those women were hardly victims.

650
00:36:05,797 --> 00:36:07,766
They said they were
just trying to summon

651
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,392
a little help from
some kind of goddess.

652
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:11,459
They were summoning
an evil bitch.

653
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:14,840
You looked me up?
Says "Trickster"?

654
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:17,670
See, that's honest.
Yes, I fuck with the weak.

655
00:36:17,742 --> 00:36:19,438
You know what that
does? Improves the herd.

656
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:22,379
I help the same little
creatures you want to help.

657
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:24,687
It's not surprising. You're
my son. How else could it be?

658
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:27,878
But her, the benevolent
Our Lady Underground?

659
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:30,148
Oh, it is all about her.

660
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:32,952
Power, attention,
grinding men and gods

661
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,289
into the fucking dirt,
and then she leaves.

662
00:36:45,837 --> 00:36:47,100
You loved her.

663
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:52,876
Guess there are some
things you can't control after all.

664
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,742
I can see you're upset,

665
00:36:56,815 --> 00:36:58,807
but I need you
to move past that.

666
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:02,786
Stop worrying about
humans. They're beneath you.

667
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:04,853
This is your birthright, son.

668
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,652
We're gonna do so much together.

669
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:13,474
How'd you do it? You
know, turn me back?

670
00:37:13,498 --> 00:37:15,126
A special Fillorian mint.

671
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,832
About 50 straight
minutes of casting,

672
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,133
so I'm gonna need
a minute to recharge.

673
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:24,337
You're sure you don't
want any clothes or... Mmm.

674
00:37:25,677 --> 00:37:28,272
Can't you get Margo to help,
you know, give you a break?

675
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:30,381
I kind of threw
her in the dungeon.

676
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:31,575
Got you.

677
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:35,017
Well, you'll run yourself dead
doing everything on your own.

678
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:36,310
Believe me, I know.

679
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:37,821
Pass some shit down the chain,

680
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:40,620
to the governors or
the dukes or whatever.

681
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,157
You don't have any governors?

682
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:47,624
No dukes?

683
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,624
Get you some delegates, son!

684
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:51,727
Right. Really good idea.

685
00:37:51,836 --> 00:37:53,429
Select governors.

686
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:56,034
Yet another task
for the High King.

687
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,599
Or you just hold an election.

688
00:37:58,743 --> 00:38:01,611
Let the people pick
their own. You do <i>nada.</i>

689
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:04,577
That's... Stupid? Is
it stupid? I'm sorry.

690
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:08,848
Brilliant. Josh, I think you
just invented democracy,

691
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,650
and it's going to save Fillory.

692
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:13,017
Well, high five, brother!

693
00:38:16,828 --> 00:38:18,956
Eliot?

694
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,294
What the hell?

695
00:38:23,168 --> 00:38:24,363
Dude,

696
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:28,006
I thought you were off being,
like, the High King of Fillory.

697
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:29,734
I am.

698
00:38:30,742 --> 00:38:31,742
I was.

699
00:38:33,645 --> 00:38:35,773
I think I just got kicked out.

700
00:38:45,523 --> 00:38:49,483
Of course. Her book is
relocated to the Poison Room.

701
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:51,756
Okay.

702
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,428
So what's our next move?

703
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,357
Admit I'm fucking cursed?

704
00:38:55,466 --> 00:38:56,644
Is this all you guys do?

705
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,068
You talk about your fee-fees?

706
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,547
I was kind of hoping
you'd get to fucking.

707
00:38:59,571 --> 00:39:00,630
What?

708
00:39:00,872 --> 00:39:02,067
How did you...

709
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,506
Oh, I hopped into your mind
when you hopped into hers.

710
00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:06,020
It's a little trick my
dad's friends taught me.

711
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:09,208
Your dad's friends are perverts?

712
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,942
Thugs. Magic mobsters.

713
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,108
No, they're not. Jesus.

714
00:39:12,217 --> 00:39:13,947
Which is why I'm
leaving. So's Willow.

715
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,044
Meadow, doofus.
Fine, kick me out,

716
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,418
if you really don't
need my help.

717
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:19,113
Help with what?

718
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,052
Trying to break into
the Poison Room.

719
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:23,404
I've been in your
crappy Nolan movie

720
00:39:23,428 --> 00:39:25,192
for, like, 20 minutes.
I heard everything.

721
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:26,473
I've been trying to
get in there myself

722
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:29,262
'cause, you know, I'm
curious about a few things.

723
00:39:29,334 --> 00:39:31,045
So either you start from
square one on your own,

724
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:34,096
or you can hop
the line and join...

725
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,105
The pervy mob
girl has a point. No.

726
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:41,211
It's dangerous. You
know what's safe?

727
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:42,641
Nothing.

728
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,024
You're not responsible
for me, okay?

729
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,539
Free will. I exercise that shit.

730
00:39:47,452 --> 00:39:48,452
I'm gonna hate this.

731
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:50,988
You hate everything.
It's why I like you.

732
00:39:52,257 --> 00:39:56,160
Kady. Kady. Kady, wake up.

733
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:00,827
Kady. Hey.

734
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,094
What?

735
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:04,658
Hey, you got a guest.

736
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,033
Professor Lipson told
me to bring him here.

737
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:16,303
If you're still after
Reynard, I want in.

738
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:22,914
Eliot?

739
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:26,515
Oh, you.

740
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:29,290
I shouldn't be here, but...

741
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:35,325
Please, Your
Majesty, be careful.

742
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:37,161
So not a nice Scotch, then.

743
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:40,399
It will transport you
to the Fairy Realm.

744
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:44,407
I must warn you, few return.

745
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:49,006
But if there's a chance
to save Fen, the baby...

746
00:40:50,848 --> 00:40:51,872
I would go, but...

747
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:57,150
You're a pussy, who's in love
with a sloth who's currently a rat,

748
00:40:57,221 --> 00:40:59,918
and, end of the day,
it's my mess to clean up.

749
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:02,691
Tell Eliot that.

750
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,065
Q, it's time.

751
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:20,868
This is it. It's why I couldn't
make the math work.

752
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:22,971
What math? The spell
to bring Alice back.

753
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:25,312
I knew something was
missing. I just didn't know...

754
00:41:25,383 --> 00:41:26,544
It was me.

755
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:30,811
You have to go now.

756
00:41:31,556 --> 00:41:34,583
There's a portal in
there, back to reception.

757
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,395
And I'm glad we
got to say goodbye.

758
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:44,098
I'm gonna be back
here for good one day,

759
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:47,067
and I am going to find you.

760
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:52,275
Okay.

761
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:03,253
You first.

762
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:25,108
Jules, what the hell?

763
00:42:25,176 --> 00:42:26,405
This isn't up for debate.

764
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:27,755
We came here
so that you could...

765
00:42:27,779 --> 00:42:30,806
Yeah. So? Things change.

766
00:42:31,783 --> 00:42:33,183
If you do this... I know.

767
00:42:33,518 --> 00:42:36,852
This is my one shot, and
this is what I want to do with it.

768
00:42:37,255 --> 00:42:39,224
I found them! Stop!

769
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:40,690
Come on, or we'll lose her, too.

770
00:42:40,758 --> 00:42:42,078
You can't take that Shade.

771
00:42:42,827 --> 00:42:43,920
You, stop!

772
00:42:43,995 --> 00:42:46,123
It's all going to
be okay, Quentin.
