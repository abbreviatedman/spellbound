364
00:17:20,745 --> 00:17:22,229

- Julia!

365
00:17:22,315 --> 00:17:24,346

- Oh, welcome!

366
00:17:24,471 --> 00:17:25,971

377
00:17:53,207 --> 00:17:54,292

384

The underworld is massive.
There's every ecosystem.

385
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,480
Nearest we can tell,
about 2,000 islands

386
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,099

387
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,550

a bowling alley?

388
00:18:16,575 --> 00:18:17,627
Fuck yeah.

389
00:18:17,652 --> 00:18:18,702
And the powers that be

390
00:18:18,771 --> 00:18:21,071
are into whatever
helps us settle in

391
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,673
so that we can move on.

392
00:18:22,816 --> 00:18:24,675
Ow, yeah!
Whoo!

393
00:18:25,027 --> 00:18:27,199
- "Powers that be"?
- Yeah. Gods.

394
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,894
We were right about
them being real.

395
00:18:28,964 --> 00:18:30,566
Hades created the Underworld,

396
00:18:30,699 --> 00:18:32,191
runs it with his wife,
Persephone.

397
00:18:32,238 --> 00:18:34,699
They live in a big house
way over here.

398
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:37,191
It's a beautiful area
called Elysium.

399
00:18:37,347 --> 00:18:39,464
Apparently, they used to
come and go like clockwork

400
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:42,081
every fall and spring,
but a while back,

401
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:43,472
they just disappeared.

402
00:18:43,535 --> 00:18:45,644
Wait, why are you
doing all this, Richard?

403
00:18:46,683 --> 00:18:48,732
I know you.
This is a project.

404
00:18:49,105 --> 00:18:50,667
I'm trying to find my son.

405
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,337
I don't know where he is,
if he's even still here.

406
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,050
But he's got to be somewhere.

407
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,808
And they won't tell me
a damn thing.

408
00:18:58,081 --> 00:18:59,910
Why not?

409
00:19:00,214 --> 00:19:03,247
I'm flagged as culpable
in his death.

410
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:04,878
There are rules.

411
00:19:05,058 --> 00:19:07,308
And friends to help me
break them.

412
00:19:09,253 --> 00:19:11,269
Okay, so wait, so where
do they keep the Shades?

413
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:12,956
Sorry, we don't know that yet.

414
00:19:13,089 --> 00:19:14,151
So we're flying blind?

415
00:19:14,316 --> 00:19:16,488
Hun, you're gonna have to bowl.

416
00:19:16,542 --> 00:19:18,597
No, look, I had an incident
when I was a kid.

417
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,324
- My fingers got stuck in the...
- Oh, get over it.

418

Your girl would.

419
00:19:21,855 --> 00:19:23,691
- She's not my girl.
- No shit.

420
00:19:23,785 --> 00:19:25,402
She's tough as granite.

421
00:19:25,535 --> 00:19:27,371
And you're afraid to bowl.

422
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,472
Fine.

423
00:19:33,943 --> 00:19:37,281
How long before the dragon
eats you and Quentin?

424
00:19:37,591 --> 00:19:38,982
Tomorrow morning.

Yeah, well,

are kept at reception.

count the number of times

trying to find my little boy.

- Oh, my God, Julia!

- You wanted to talk?
- You lying son of a bitch.

447
00:20:37,761 --> 00:20:41,151
You turned Fen into a rat,
along with half the castle.

448
00:20:41,386 --> 00:20:43,026
Fen is in her human form,

449
00:20:43,249 --> 00:20:44,848
in the Fairy Realm.

450
00:20:45,097 --> 00:20:46,721

because you tried to

451

get clever with our deal.

452

into snake food?

- That wasn't the fairies.
- Oh.

903
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:41,633
Um, I'm gonna be back here
for good one day,

904
00:41:41,868 --> 00:41:44,915
and I am going to find you.

905
00:41:48,915 --> 00:41:50,204
Okay.
