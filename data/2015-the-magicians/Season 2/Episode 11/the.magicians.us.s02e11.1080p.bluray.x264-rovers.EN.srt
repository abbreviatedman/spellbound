1
00:00:01,423 --> 00:00:03,310
Previously on The Magicians...

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:04,896
My hands won't cast.

3
00:00:04,932 --> 00:00:07,523
- We can help you, Penny.
- What's the catch?

4
00:00:07,643 --> 00:00:08,842
"Bound in service to the library

5
00:00:08,877 --> 00:00:10,977
up to and after my death"?

6
00:00:11,013 --> 00:00:13,413
- That isn't just any door.
- Then what is it?

7
00:00:13,448 --> 00:00:14,548
The Poison Room.

8
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:15,882
There is knowledge behind that door

9
00:00:15,918 --> 00:00:17,617
that could destroy
more than just people.

10
00:00:17,653 --> 00:00:19,052
It could destroy worlds.

11
00:00:19,087 --> 00:00:20,620
"The Ars Deicidium"?

12
00:00:20,656 --> 00:00:22,422
"The art of killing gods."

13
00:00:22,457 --> 00:00:24,858
King Idri is our honored guest.

14
00:00:24,893 --> 00:00:26,126
We're getting married.

15
00:00:26,161 --> 00:00:28,795
One big, royal polyamorous family.

16
00:00:28,831 --> 00:00:31,131
The fairies can bring back
the wellspring?

17
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:32,132
They can.

18
00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:33,633
And in return?

19
00:00:33,669 --> 00:00:35,602
The child that grows in the womb

20
00:00:35,637 --> 00:00:37,204
of the High King's wife.

21
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:40,140
Some friends and I summoned a goddess.

22
00:00:40,175 --> 00:00:42,809
You may address me as Reynard the Fox,

23
00:00:42,845 --> 00:00:44,711
trickster of the very stupid.

24
00:00:44,746 --> 00:00:47,380
Reynard's son is John Gaines?

25
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:49,015
My son...

26
00:00:50,752 --> 00:00:53,019
Jules, I talked to your shade.

27
00:00:53,055 --> 00:00:54,254
She's not gone.

28
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:55,622
So where is she?

29
00:00:55,657 --> 00:00:57,657
Shades go to the Underworld.

30
00:00:57,693 --> 00:00:59,593
The living can access the Underworld

31
00:00:59,628 --> 00:01:00,994
with the help of a Gatekeeper.

32
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:02,029
An Ancient One.

33
00:01:02,064 --> 00:01:04,631
I think I figured out
what an Ancient One is.

34
00:01:10,405 --> 00:01:13,039
Look, Q, you don't have to come with me.

35
00:01:13,075 --> 00:01:15,909
In fact, I don't think that you should.

36
00:01:15,944 --> 00:01:18,879
Noted, but I'm coming.

37
00:01:18,914 --> 00:01:21,381
You feel the energy coming off that?

38
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:24,117
Yeah, also the stink.

39
00:01:27,055 --> 00:01:30,357
I don't know, my ancient Greek
is a little rusty.

40
00:01:30,392 --> 00:01:32,792
"The old reveals itself to the new

41
00:01:32,828 --> 00:01:36,229
at the fall of milk teeth."

42
00:01:36,265 --> 00:01:38,298
Milk teeth?

43
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:39,866
Oh, baby teeth.

44
00:01:39,902 --> 00:01:42,435
You think we have to
stick one in to open it up?

45
00:01:42,471 --> 00:01:43,904
I mean, I could write a spell.

46
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:46,473
Uh, we could find
the nearest child's house

47
00:01:46,508 --> 00:01:47,708
expecting the Tooth Fairy and...

48
00:01:47,743 --> 00:01:50,443
Break in and steal their teeth?

49
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,946
I'd leave money.

50
00:01:54,182 --> 00:01:56,149
Uh, I hate to bring this up,
but I actually...

51
00:01:56,184 --> 00:01:57,550
I still have one...

52
00:01:57,586 --> 00:01:58,919
a molar that never came in.

53
00:01:58,954 --> 00:02:01,187
Oh, I know an extraction spell.

54
00:02:01,223 --> 00:02:02,155
Ah!

55
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,024
- Fuck!
- Sorry.

56
00:02:07,029 --> 00:02:09,229
This dragon better be fucking cool.

57
00:02:16,438 --> 00:02:19,114
Hmm...

58
00:02:19,149 --> 00:02:21,316
Or not.

59
00:02:37,768 --> 00:02:39,868
I wouldn't have guessed baby teeth.

60
00:02:39,903 --> 00:02:42,504
Why would a dragon want baby teeth?

61
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:46,174
- Shit.
- I collect baby teeth.

62
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:48,677
As I collect many things, little mammal.

63
00:02:54,017 --> 00:02:56,451
Uh, greetings, your Ladyship.

64
00:02:56,486 --> 00:02:58,186
"Your Ladyship"?

65
00:02:58,221 --> 00:03:01,389
I am a Queen of the Great Worms.

66
00:03:01,425 --> 00:03:02,958
Of course you are.

67
00:03:02,993 --> 00:03:05,427
Uh, that's awesome... I wasn't
suggesting that you weren't.

68
00:03:05,462 --> 00:03:08,663
Your manner does not endear
me to you, human.

69
00:03:12,102 --> 00:03:15,370
We seek passage to the
Underworld, oh Ancient One.

70
00:03:17,808 --> 00:03:20,375
Hmm. You seek to die.

71
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:24,846
Uh, no, actually, we were
hoping to come back after.

72
00:03:24,881 --> 00:03:26,915
Suit yourself.

73
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,017
I require a gift.

74
00:03:29,052 --> 00:03:31,619
A gift? Um...

75
00:03:31,655 --> 00:03:33,088
yeah, I mean, name it,

76
00:03:33,123 --> 00:03:35,256
and we'll get it for you.

77
00:03:35,292 --> 00:03:38,393
You already have it.

78
00:03:38,428 --> 00:03:40,729
It's in your pocket.

79
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:50,405
No. Pick something else.

80
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,607
No, if it gets you your Shade back...

81
00:03:52,642 --> 00:03:54,342
No.

82
00:03:54,378 --> 00:03:56,011
Fillory is your home.

83
00:03:56,046 --> 00:03:57,779
And what about your friends?
What if they need you?

84
00:03:57,814 --> 00:03:59,781
We can't.

85
00:04:01,852 --> 00:04:04,886
Queen of the Great Worms.

86
00:04:04,921 --> 00:04:07,055
What if I, uh, needed to borrow it

87
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,257
in the future, just super briefly?

88
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:10,525
No.

89
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,360
If you wish to return home,

90
00:04:12,396 --> 00:04:14,195
you must find other means.

91
00:04:14,231 --> 00:04:17,899
The first door remains open,
little mammal.

92
00:04:17,934 --> 00:04:22,470
Great, um, I super love riddles.

93
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:31,613
Are you giving me the button or not?

94
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:44,092
Your bodies will stay here,
and your souls will travel.

95
00:04:44,127 --> 00:04:46,561
You have 24 hours
to return to the portal.

96
00:04:46,596 --> 00:04:48,029
Or?

97
00:04:48,065 --> 00:04:51,366
I sit patiently,
waiting for you to come back.

98
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:55,470
No, I eat you... I'm a fucking
dragon, what do you expect?

99
00:04:55,505 --> 00:04:56,871
Great, good to know.

100
00:04:56,907 --> 00:04:59,674
Then it's settled.

101
00:05:05,382 --> 00:05:07,682
Jesus, a little warning next time.

102
00:05:07,717 --> 00:05:10,118
Really.

103
00:05:10,153 --> 00:05:13,288
Q, look.

104
00:05:13,323 --> 00:05:14,856
Time to go.

105
00:05:17,894 --> 00:05:20,128
Fucking millennials.

106
00:05:43,453 --> 00:05:45,987
Welcome to the Underworld.

107
00:05:48,058 --> 00:05:50,458
Please take a number.

108
00:05:55,499 --> 00:05:57,065
The fuck?

109
00:06:12,582 --> 00:06:14,349
Idri is almost here.

110
00:06:14,384 --> 00:06:17,619
And does anyone know where Fen is?

111
00:06:22,092 --> 00:06:25,193
I present King Idri of Loria.

112
00:06:29,132 --> 00:06:31,599
My life is perfect.

113
00:06:31,635 --> 00:06:32,934
Hello.

114
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:35,003
Josh... wine, canapÃ©s.

115
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:36,771
I said have it ready.

116
00:06:36,806 --> 00:06:39,607
We have a lovely blend of...

117
00:06:39,643 --> 00:06:40,775
Ahem. Okay.

118
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,010
And where are the fire dancers?

119
00:06:42,045 --> 00:06:45,180
I don't know.

120
00:06:45,215 --> 00:06:46,848
I'm sorry, I had a whole thing...

121
00:06:46,883 --> 00:06:48,616
Your Majesty, this presentation

122
00:06:48,652 --> 00:06:51,452
is beautiful, but...

123
00:06:51,488 --> 00:06:53,621
It would be so much better
with fire dancers, I know.

124
00:06:53,657 --> 00:06:56,524
I hope my arrival isn't
causing undue stress.

125
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,226
Stress?

126
00:06:58,261 --> 00:07:01,229
- I'm not stressed...
- Eliot.

127
00:07:01,264 --> 00:07:04,232
- I don't care about ceremony.
- You don't?

128
00:07:04,267 --> 00:07:07,769
- But...
- But I came here for you.

129
00:07:07,804 --> 00:07:11,639
Oh.

130
00:07:11,675 --> 00:07:13,608
Well...

131
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:16,644
the feeling's mutual.

132
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:21,649
Take me somewhere we can
become a bit better acquainted.

133
00:07:21,685 --> 00:07:23,585
Alone.

134
00:07:26,856 --> 00:07:29,324
Congratulations, you're dead.

135
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:33,027
You've passed through the veil
to the Underworld.

136
00:07:33,063 --> 00:07:34,829
Is this your final destination?

137
00:07:34,864 --> 00:07:36,297
No.

138
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,366
It's the first leg of your journey.

139
00:07:38,401 --> 00:07:41,569
We designed this part
of the Underworld for you,

140
00:07:41,605 --> 00:07:44,138
based on your life
and personal expectations

141
00:07:44,174 --> 00:07:47,008
to facilitate a comfortable transition.

142
00:07:47,043 --> 00:07:51,079
You've been grouped with others
who have similar expectations.

143
00:07:51,114 --> 00:07:52,347
Perfect, right?

144
00:07:52,382 --> 00:07:55,550
- Ow.
- What?

145
00:07:55,585 --> 00:07:58,453
Settle into this
next stage of your existence.

146
00:07:58,488 --> 00:08:00,888
In the unlikely event
you're missing your Shade,

147
00:08:00,924 --> 00:08:03,524
please report to a bellhop immediately.

148
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,593
Enjoy your wait.

149
00:08:09,165 --> 00:08:10,598
I guess we need to find a bellhop.

150
00:08:10,634 --> 00:08:12,500
Security, we have a Shade-less patron!

151
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:13,901
What? Hey!

152
00:08:13,937 --> 00:08:15,270
- Take him away.
- Why? Where are you taking me?

153
00:08:15,305 --> 00:08:17,639
- Thank you, thank you.
- Read me my rights!

154
00:08:17,674 --> 00:08:19,807
Hey, let go! Wait, ow!

155
00:08:19,843 --> 00:08:22,543
Or, you know, we take a beat.

156
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:24,245
173.

157
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:27,515
I'm 173.

158
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,916
Place your hands on the counter

159
00:08:28,952 --> 00:08:31,386
for identification, please.

160
00:08:34,524 --> 00:08:37,292
Hey, do you know where they
were taking that guy just now?

161
00:08:37,327 --> 00:08:40,995
Oh, his soul is missing a little piece.

162
00:08:41,031 --> 00:08:42,297
They just took him somewhere where

163
00:08:42,332 --> 00:08:44,098
he would be more comfortable.

164
00:08:44,134 --> 00:08:45,500
So he could be reunited with it?

165
00:08:45,535 --> 00:08:47,368
I doubt it, that's very difficult to do.

166
00:08:47,404 --> 00:08:49,837
Especially after a prolonged separation.

167
00:08:49,873 --> 00:08:51,105
Yeah, but you can't just take...

168
00:08:51,141 --> 00:08:52,573
I assure you, all the Shades

169
00:08:52,609 --> 00:08:55,943
are safe and well protected
for their eternity.

170
00:08:55,979 --> 00:08:57,979
Nothing to worry over.

171
00:08:58,014 --> 00:08:59,180
Ah, here we are.

172
00:08:59,215 --> 00:09:02,283
Wicker and Coldwater.

173
00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:03,918
Oh.

174
00:09:03,953 --> 00:09:05,320
Oh, my.

175
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:13,194
- What?
- You've both died 39 times.

176
00:09:13,229 --> 00:09:15,997
Aha... time loop. Thought so.

177
00:09:16,032 --> 00:09:18,733
Our computers do not handle these well.

178
00:09:18,768 --> 00:09:21,402
This will take a bit to sort out.

179
00:09:21,438 --> 00:09:23,371
Once you're in the system,
we'll reunite you

180
00:09:23,406 --> 00:09:24,772
with your immediate karmic circle,

181
00:09:24,808 --> 00:09:26,941
but until then, I'll need to
stick you somewhere.

182
00:09:26,976 --> 00:09:28,376
Do you like skiing?

183
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:30,311
Look, I thought
this was just a waystation.

184
00:09:30,347 --> 00:09:32,680
- We're kind of in a hurry...
- Oh, it is.

185
00:09:32,716 --> 00:09:35,216
But souls do stay a while,

186
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:37,885
until they're ready to...

187
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:39,320
move on.

188
00:09:39,356 --> 00:09:41,389
Snorkeling? Art museums?

189
00:09:41,424 --> 00:09:44,292
Actually, is it possible
to check on a few names?

190
00:09:44,327 --> 00:09:47,462
I think I might have
a karmic circle we could visit.

191
00:09:56,773 --> 00:09:58,072
You're making progress.

192
00:09:58,108 --> 00:09:59,273
Am I?

193
00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:01,409
Nothing's happening.

194
00:10:01,444 --> 00:10:04,045
It's an exceedingly
difficult way to do magic.

195
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,348
Trying to isolate muscles not
generally associated with...

196
00:10:07,384 --> 00:10:09,484
Call it what it is.

197
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,119
Sphincter magic.

198
00:10:11,154 --> 00:10:12,820
Gets me there, no shame.

199
00:10:12,856 --> 00:10:14,088
And if it doesn't,

200
00:10:14,124 --> 00:10:16,290
we all need a healthy pelvic floor.

201
00:10:16,326 --> 00:10:18,159
Now, I'm afraid study time is over.

202
00:10:18,194 --> 00:10:20,094
I have your next job.

203
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,897
- Re-shelving books.
- Great.

204
00:10:22,932 --> 00:10:25,166
Any questions, direct them to...

205
00:10:25,201 --> 00:10:26,501
where'd she go?

206
00:10:26,536 --> 00:10:28,102
- Sylvia!
- What?

207
00:10:28,138 --> 00:10:29,637
Shh!

208
00:10:33,943 --> 00:10:37,612
Penny, Sylvia. Sylvia, Penny.

209
00:10:37,647 --> 00:10:39,614
So what, I'm babysitting now?

210
00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:40,782
Oh, no.

211
00:10:40,817 --> 00:10:42,250
Sylvia is your supervisor.

212
00:10:42,285 --> 00:10:44,585
Good luck, I'll check back.

213
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,724
Nice scarf.

214
00:10:51,795 --> 00:10:56,063
Anyway, I married Fen because I had to.

215
00:10:56,099 --> 00:10:59,567
But I didn't know her at all.

216
00:10:59,602 --> 00:11:02,069
And now...

217
00:11:02,105 --> 00:11:05,173
I don't know you.

218
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,974
My wife used to say, there's one way

219
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:10,912
to learn to be with another person.

220
00:11:10,947 --> 00:11:12,947
The hard way?

221
00:11:12,982 --> 00:11:15,817
Actually, yes.

222
00:11:15,852 --> 00:11:17,385
Stand up.

223
00:11:22,892 --> 00:11:25,660
Would you mind removing this?

224
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:35,470
Buttons, too, please.

225
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,875
- What are you doing?
- Shh.

226
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:44,278
This is a lesson.

227
00:11:44,314 --> 00:11:47,748
All of them.

228
00:11:47,784 --> 00:11:49,050
Please.

229
00:11:53,189 --> 00:11:55,022
I really hate to bring this up,

230
00:11:55,058 --> 00:11:58,960
but you do realize there's
nothing we can actually do.

231
00:11:58,995 --> 00:12:00,695
Oh, I know.

232
00:12:02,565 --> 00:12:04,799
And yet, there's so much we can do.

233
00:12:06,836 --> 00:12:09,203
I can't touch you,

234
00:12:09,239 --> 00:12:11,639
you can't touch me,

235
00:12:11,674 --> 00:12:15,209
but I can tell you
how I want to touch you.

236
00:12:15,245 --> 00:12:19,280
And you can show me
how you like to be touched.

237
00:12:19,315 --> 00:12:22,283
I admire your commitment to education.

238
00:12:23,987 --> 00:12:27,355
If you're waiting for
my permission, don't.

239
00:12:38,301 --> 00:12:40,434
What the fuck?

240
00:12:41,938 --> 00:12:44,305
Eliot, Heloise just turned into a rat!

241
00:12:46,342 --> 00:12:47,508
Who is that?

242
00:12:49,479 --> 00:12:52,164
I'm not getting laid tonight, am I?

243
00:12:55,648 --> 00:12:58,019
- This is all of them?
- We can't be sure.

244
00:12:58,382 --> 00:12:59,524
So many people have vanished

245
00:12:59,555 --> 00:13:01,623
and there are so many rats
in the castle already.

246
00:13:01,743 --> 00:13:04,477
Well, one of 'em has to be Fen.

247
00:13:04,546 --> 00:13:06,813
Okay, bottom line it for me.

248
00:13:06,881 --> 00:13:08,014
What the fuck is going on?

249
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:09,449
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

250
00:13:09,517 --> 00:13:11,551
But this magic,
I've never seen it before.

251
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,021
Abigail? If you can hear me, squeak.

252
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:16,723
Let me know you're okay.

253
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:20,660
Why didn't I study
how to speak rat in school?

254
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,930
Okay, search the castle.

255
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:24,999
Find every rat.

256
00:13:25,033 --> 00:13:26,633
And then Council meeting.

257
00:13:26,701 --> 00:13:29,469
Or what's left of the Council.

258
00:13:49,991 --> 00:13:51,224
What do we call that?

259
00:13:51,292 --> 00:13:52,992
Mm...

260
00:13:53,061 --> 00:13:55,928
In-sex-tion?

261
00:13:55,997 --> 00:13:58,431
Inter-cepti-course?

262
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,668
Incepti-sex.

263
00:14:01,736 --> 00:14:03,803
"Incepti-sex."

264
00:14:03,872 --> 00:14:05,972
I like that.

265
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:09,108
That said, I like real life better.

266
00:14:09,177 --> 00:14:11,210
Mm.

267
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,081
But at least this way, we
don't have to get up for beers.

268
00:14:18,987 --> 00:14:20,753
Thank you.

269
00:14:24,693 --> 00:14:27,794
So, no pressure,

270
00:14:27,862 --> 00:14:30,229
but...

271
00:14:30,298 --> 00:14:31,597
any word on the Poison Room?

272
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,132
Believe me, I want to get in there.

273
00:14:33,201 --> 00:14:34,901
It's... it's above my pay grade.

274
00:14:34,969 --> 00:14:36,736
I need a code to get in.

275
00:14:36,805 --> 00:14:38,504
Well, what about that librarian?

276
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:40,006
Oh, man, if she has the code,

277
00:14:40,075 --> 00:14:42,075
it is locked down tighter
than a nun's pussy.

278
00:14:42,143 --> 00:14:44,043
Right, of course it is.

279
00:14:44,112 --> 00:14:47,914
Hey, does she have a book of her?

280
00:14:47,982 --> 00:14:50,883
Everyone has a book.

281
00:14:50,952 --> 00:14:51,784
You're thinking...

282
00:14:51,853 --> 00:14:54,554
If the room is that important...

283
00:14:54,622 --> 00:14:57,056
It's in her book.

284
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,391
Okay.

285
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,460
I can work on that.

286
00:15:00,528 --> 00:15:02,595
Hey, what's up with the Senator?

287
00:15:02,664 --> 00:15:03,996
He went back to work.

288
00:15:04,065 --> 00:15:05,431
He made up some bullshit excuse

289
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,666
about the kidnapping.

290
00:15:06,735 --> 00:15:08,901
All the news outlets bought it.

291
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,503
But hey, get this...

292
00:15:10,572 --> 00:15:13,206
I saw Reynard in the back of
a press photo.

293
00:15:13,274 --> 00:15:15,808
In a suit, like an advisor or something.

294
00:15:15,877 --> 00:15:17,844
Are you kidding me?

295
00:15:17,912 --> 00:15:20,113
He's a trickster.

296
00:15:20,181 --> 00:15:21,881
Guess that includes his own son.

297
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:23,216
Jesus Christ.

298
00:15:24,786 --> 00:15:26,486
We can't get one more vote?

299
00:15:26,554 --> 00:15:28,394
We're in touch with
Matthews, Bauer, Wheeler.

300
00:15:28,456 --> 00:15:31,090
Just give 'em a couple of days,
they'll come to their senses.

301
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:32,492
Call in Senator Cowden.

302
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,260
Why bother? He won't budge.

303
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:36,696
We can change his mind. Trust me.

304
00:15:36,765 --> 00:15:38,698
How?

305
00:15:38,767 --> 00:15:40,967
Everyone, give us a minute.

306
00:15:46,441 --> 00:15:49,408
So they're taking your orders now?

307
00:15:49,477 --> 00:15:50,643
Have been for a while.

308
00:15:50,712 --> 00:15:52,745
I controlled their minds.

309
00:15:52,814 --> 00:15:55,715
Just like you have, many, many times.

310
00:15:55,784 --> 00:15:57,416
I don't know what you're talking about.

311
00:15:57,485 --> 00:15:59,452
You know you have that power.

312
00:15:59,521 --> 00:16:01,921
You've been using it your whole life.

313
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:05,491
I always thought I had some kind of...

314
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:08,895
god-level good luck.

315
00:16:08,963 --> 00:16:11,931
True, you've only used it instinctively,

316
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,533
but I'm here now.

317
00:16:13,601 --> 00:16:15,735
I can teach you how to use it at will.

318
00:16:15,804 --> 00:16:17,336
Easy.

319
00:16:17,405 --> 00:16:19,472
And once you've mastered it,

320
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,974
that's how you get Cowden's vote.

321
00:16:22,043 --> 00:16:23,576
I don't know that I want to do that.

322
00:16:23,645 --> 00:16:26,512
- It feels like cheating.
- They all don't cheat?

323
00:16:26,581 --> 00:16:28,648
Everyone uses whatever
they've got, John,

324
00:16:28,716 --> 00:16:30,950
and the bad ones don't hesitate.

325
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:32,251
So someone like you,

326
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,187
someone who wants to do some

327
00:16:34,255 --> 00:16:36,255
actual good in the world,

328
00:16:36,324 --> 00:16:39,325
how can you not?

329
00:16:39,394 --> 00:16:41,394
Here's all you have to do.

330
00:16:41,462 --> 00:16:43,529
Look at me.

331
00:16:46,267 --> 00:16:48,334
You look him straight in the eye,

332
00:16:48,403 --> 00:16:51,137
and you tell him, plainly.

333
00:16:51,206 --> 00:16:53,439
Directly.

334
00:16:53,508 --> 00:16:55,708
That's it?

335
00:16:55,777 --> 00:16:58,911
It's that simple.

336
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,780
Good luck with the meeting, Senator.

337
00:17:13,494 --> 00:17:14,934
Why would anyone want their afterlife

338
00:17:14,963 --> 00:17:17,530
to look like a terrible
middle school birthday party?

339
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,198
Is this about your "incident"?

340
00:17:19,267 --> 00:17:21,167
- I moved on.
- Have you?

341
00:17:21,236 --> 00:17:22,635
- Julia?
- Julia!

342
00:17:22,704 --> 00:17:24,837
- Julia!
- Oh, welcome!

343
00:17:24,906 --> 00:17:26,873
Welcome!

344
00:17:26,941 --> 00:17:28,541
Where's Bender? Is he okay?

345
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:30,042
He's great. He moved on.

346
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,879
Uh, who's your friend,
and what's his shoe size?

347
00:17:32,947 --> 00:17:34,947
Uh, we're not really here to bowl.

348
00:17:35,016 --> 00:17:36,816
Kid, the first rule of being dead,

349
00:17:36,885 --> 00:17:38,885
if you're here, ya bowl.

350
00:17:38,953 --> 00:17:40,519
We're actually not dead, either.

351
00:17:40,588 --> 00:17:41,988
Uh, we're here because
we need your help.

352
00:17:42,056 --> 00:17:43,756
Julia?

353
00:17:50,832 --> 00:17:53,199
What?

354
00:17:53,268 --> 00:17:54,533
Nothing.

355
00:17:54,602 --> 00:17:56,569
It's... it's good to see you, Richard.

356
00:17:56,638 --> 00:17:59,071
- I mean, the real you.
- The real me?

357
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,307
What happened?

358
00:18:01,376 --> 00:18:02,508
I need your help.

359
00:18:02,577 --> 00:18:04,744
I need to find my Shade.

360
00:18:04,812 --> 00:18:06,345
Okay.

361
00:18:09,454 --> 00:18:11,960
The underworld is massive.
There's every ecosystem.

362
00:18:12,088 --> 00:18:14,332
Nearest we can tell, about 2,000 islands

363
00:18:14,603 --> 00:18:16,303
built to look like Hawaii.

364
00:18:16,371 --> 00:18:17,604
And you went with a bowling alley?

365
00:18:17,673 --> 00:18:18,673
Fuck yeah.

366
00:18:18,707 --> 00:18:19,906
And the powers that be

367
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:22,275
are into whatever helps us settle in

368
00:18:22,344 --> 00:18:23,877
so that we can move on.

369
00:18:23,946 --> 00:18:25,879
Ow, yeah! Whoo!

370
00:18:25,948 --> 00:18:28,348
- "Powers that be"?
- Yeah. Gods.

371
00:18:28,417 --> 00:18:29,916
We were right about them being real.

372
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:31,585
Hades created the Underworld,

373
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:33,053
runs it with his wife, Persephone.

374
00:18:33,121 --> 00:18:35,789
They live in a big house way over here.

375
00:18:35,857 --> 00:18:38,191
It's a beautiful area called Elysium.

376
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,594
Apparently, they used to
come and go like clockwork

377
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:43,196
every fall and spring, but a while back,

378
00:18:43,265 --> 00:18:44,531
they just disappeared.

379
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,601
Wait, why are you
doing all this, Richard?

380
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:49,936
I know you. This is a project.

381
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:51,871
I'm trying to find my son.

382
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,541
I don't know where he is,
if he's even still here.

383
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,076
But he's got to be somewhere.

384
00:18:56,144 --> 00:18:59,012
And they won't tell me a damn thing.

385
00:18:59,081 --> 00:19:01,114
Why not?

386
00:19:01,183 --> 00:19:04,451
I'm flagged as culpable in his death.

387
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:05,919
There are rules.

388
00:19:05,988 --> 00:19:08,288
And friends to help me break them.

389
00:19:10,058 --> 00:19:12,392
Okay, so wait, so where
do they keep the Shades?

390
00:19:12,461 --> 00:19:13,827
Sorry, we don't know that yet.

391
00:19:13,895 --> 00:19:15,095
So we're flying blind?

392
00:19:15,163 --> 00:19:17,397
Hun, you're gonna have to bowl.

393
00:19:17,466 --> 00:19:19,332
No, look, I had an incident
when I was a kid.

394
00:19:19,401 --> 00:19:21,368
- My fingers got stuck in the...
- Oh, get over it.

395
00:19:21,436 --> 00:19:22,736
Your girl would.

396
00:19:22,804 --> 00:19:24,771
- She's not my girl.
- No shit.

397
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,439
She's tough as granite.

398
00:19:26,508 --> 00:19:28,575
And you're afraid to bowl.

399
00:19:28,644 --> 00:19:29,676
Fine.

400
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:38,485
How long before the dragon
eats you and Quentin?

401
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:40,186
Tomorrow morning.

402
00:19:40,255 --> 00:19:41,721
Always the one to tell the impossible

403
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,989
to go fuck itself, huh?

404
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:46,526
Yeah, well, it doesn't always listen.

405
00:19:46,595 --> 00:19:48,795
They'll know where the Shades
are kept at reception.

406
00:19:48,864 --> 00:19:50,997
I don't know, they didn't seem too keen

407
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:53,667
on helping out a person
who looked like this.

408
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:56,636
Shit, it seems to be closing up

409
00:19:56,705 --> 00:19:58,772
much faster down here.

410
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,273
Okay, so we hurry.

411
00:20:00,342 --> 00:20:02,242
But just... not for nothing,
reception isn't keen

412
00:20:02,311 --> 00:20:04,778
to help much of anyone... I can't
count the number of times

413
00:20:04,846 --> 00:20:09,115
I've been kicked out of there,
trying to find my little boy.

414
00:20:09,184 --> 00:20:11,851
- I have an idea.
- Oh, my God, Julia!

415
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,054
I...I got a strike.

416
00:20:14,122 --> 00:20:15,021
Whoo!

417
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,523
Yeah, Q!

418
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:18,792
The thing about the
Underworld is, the first week,

419
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,727
it's always a strike.

420
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:25,598
Let him have this one.

421
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:27,467
Whoo! Go, Q!

422
00:20:27,536 --> 00:20:28,702
Ow!

423
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:38,445
- You wanted to talk?
- You lying son of a bitch.

424
00:20:38,513 --> 00:20:42,449
You turned Fen into a rat,
along with half the castle.

425
00:20:42,517 --> 00:20:44,384
Fen is in her human form,

426
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:46,052
in the Fairy Realm.

427
00:20:46,121 --> 00:20:47,620
And she was taken because you tried to

428
00:20:47,689 --> 00:20:48,988
get clever with our deal.

429
00:20:49,057 --> 00:20:52,225
So you turned half my staff
into snake food?

430
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:54,427
- That wasn't the fairies.
- Oh.

431
00:20:54,496 --> 00:20:58,131
Well, it sure smells like
their whimsical bullshit.

432
00:20:59,334 --> 00:21:01,301
"Whimsical."

433
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:03,203
It's the mark of the stupid
and the arrogant

434
00:21:03,271 --> 00:21:05,438
to attack what you can't comprehend.

435
00:21:05,507 --> 00:21:07,073
Fine.

436
00:21:07,142 --> 00:21:08,875
Get it out of your system.

437
00:21:08,944 --> 00:21:11,244
Then if you know what's going on,

438
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:13,313
just tell me.

439
00:21:13,382 --> 00:21:15,081
I take it back.

440
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:18,485
You're not entirely simple-minded.

441
00:21:18,553 --> 00:21:19,853
There's another power,

442
00:21:19,921 --> 00:21:21,921
which you made the mistake
of overlooking.

443
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,990
You want to be specific, or not?

444
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:26,025
A power without logic.

445
00:21:26,094 --> 00:21:30,430
A power that acts, not for gain,
but solely because it can.

446
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:33,099
That's the true danger.

447
00:21:33,168 --> 00:21:34,634
Face that.

448
00:21:34,703 --> 00:21:37,303
Or face the end of your kingdom.

449
00:21:46,715 --> 00:21:48,381
Uh, hey.

450
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:51,584
- I got a question for you.
- Of course.

451
00:21:51,653 --> 00:21:53,386
How can I help?

452
00:21:53,455 --> 00:21:56,990
You know, I never got your name.

453
00:21:57,058 --> 00:21:59,859
You may call me Head Librarian.

454
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,829
And, uh...

455
00:22:02,898 --> 00:22:05,765
what do I get to call you
outside of work?

456
00:22:05,834 --> 00:22:07,867
I see what you're getting at.

457
00:22:07,936 --> 00:22:10,737
But interoffice courtship
is expressly prohibited.

458
00:22:10,806 --> 00:22:13,206
I'm flattered, but rules are rule.

459
00:22:13,275 --> 00:22:14,841
Are they?

460
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:17,977
Always?

461
00:22:18,046 --> 00:22:20,747
Penny, please don't take it personally,

462
00:22:20,816 --> 00:22:23,383
but you're not my type.

463
00:22:23,452 --> 00:22:25,885
You're a touch emotionally insecure,

464
00:22:25,954 --> 00:22:28,788
for which you compensate heavily
with boisterousness

465
00:22:28,857 --> 00:22:31,257
and foul language.

466
00:22:31,326 --> 00:22:33,426
I'm here if you need anything else.

467
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:49,108
- Hey, guys.
- Mr. Corrigan.

468
00:22:49,177 --> 00:22:50,977
Uh, Mr. Corrigan, you have
no need to be in here.

469
00:22:51,046 --> 00:22:52,278
Just a couple of questions.

470
00:22:52,347 --> 00:22:54,180
- I'm gonna take a number.
- Please, sir.

471
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:56,282
Um, you know what, I'm gonna
take a couple of numbers,

472
00:22:56,351 --> 00:22:58,451
just in case I don't...
I don't hear the first number.

473
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,120
Yeah, wow, you guys got
a lot of numbers.

474
00:23:00,188 --> 00:23:01,554
Mr. Corrigan, I beseech you.

475
00:23:01,623 --> 00:23:03,423
Oh, no, does this thing
run out of numbers?

476
00:23:03,492 --> 00:23:05,332
- There we go.
- Playtime's over, Mr. Corrigan.

477
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,060
I'm not playing,
I really have questions.

478
00:23:07,128 --> 00:23:08,528
Quite the jokester you are. That is it.

479
00:23:08,597 --> 00:23:11,064
- Security!
- Don't call security, Thomas.

480
00:23:11,132 --> 00:23:12,899
- Security!
- Oh, no, security.

481
00:23:12,968 --> 00:23:14,567
- They're on their way.
- No, no, no.

482
00:23:14,636 --> 00:23:16,503
I'm just getting a number here.
Ha ha, very funny.

483
00:23:16,571 --> 00:23:18,705
Does this thing run out of numbers?

484
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:20,540
It's locked.

485
00:23:20,609 --> 00:23:23,610
Security!

486
00:23:23,678 --> 00:23:25,478
- "Disconnected Shade."
- Where?

487
00:23:25,547 --> 00:23:26,613
It doesn't say.

488
00:23:26,681 --> 00:23:28,347
Just says "E."

489
00:23:30,218 --> 00:23:32,151
Another one, "disconnected Shade, 'E.'"

490
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:35,388
Wait, if they all say "E"...

491
00:23:35,457 --> 00:23:37,223
- Elysium.
- Yes.

492
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:40,326
Okay, great, it's the complete
opposite end of the Underworld.

493
00:23:40,395 --> 00:23:42,962
Take him away for
disciplinary processing.

494
00:23:43,031 --> 00:23:44,564
- Thank you.
- There's no need, guys.

495
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:46,165
Okay, you got me.

496
00:23:46,234 --> 00:23:49,802
Hope you had some fun to make
your confinement worthwhile.

497
00:23:49,871 --> 00:23:51,938
Oh, what's a few weeks out of eternity?

498
00:23:59,915 --> 00:24:02,515
This is books for school kids.

499
00:24:02,584 --> 00:24:03,516
If it's so important,

500
00:24:03,585 --> 00:24:06,219
finding me that five mil
can't be too hard.

501
00:24:06,288 --> 00:24:07,954
I'm not adding another amendment.

502
00:24:08,023 --> 00:24:10,156
You invited me in.

503
00:24:10,225 --> 00:24:12,659
You knew what you were getting into.

504
00:24:12,727 --> 00:24:14,627
Right.

505
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:26,072
You're going to support this bill.

506
00:24:26,141 --> 00:24:29,576
In fact, your yes will be
the first vote cast.

507
00:24:33,315 --> 00:24:36,549
John, this bill should've
been passed a long time ago.

508
00:24:36,618 --> 00:24:39,953
And I'm sorry for trying to
drag you into the ditch on this.

509
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:42,722
You have my vote.

510
00:24:42,791 --> 00:24:45,124
Then I thank you for your help.

511
00:24:46,928 --> 00:24:48,294
You all right?

512
00:24:51,566 --> 00:24:53,232
Let me get you some water.

513
00:24:53,301 --> 00:24:56,336
I...I must've stood up too fast.

514
00:24:56,404 --> 00:24:59,205
Here you go.

515
00:24:59,274 --> 00:25:00,840
I...I need to make a...

516
00:25:00,909 --> 00:25:02,208
Becca!

517
00:25:02,277 --> 00:25:05,085
Becca, get the doctor.
Get the doctor now!

518
00:25:08,199 --> 00:25:10,500
John, I'm sorry but

519
00:25:10,807 --> 00:25:12,769
I think you're overestimating
yourself, here.

520
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:16,072
No, honey, I'm being 100% literal.

521
00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:17,908
I am not human, Cindy.

522
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:20,477
And I know it sounds ridiculous,
but it is true.

523
00:25:20,546 --> 00:25:21,711
Okay...

524
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,914
I think that you have
been working too hard...

525
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:24,982
No, I haven't.

526
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:26,307
I haven't.

527
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,653
I am telling you the truth.

528
00:25:29,721 --> 00:25:31,087
Because you are the one I trust.

529
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:34,291
You are the only one, really.

530
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:37,994
And I really just need
your support right now, babe.

531
00:25:39,898 --> 00:25:42,399
Of course, honey.

532
00:25:42,467 --> 00:25:45,202
I apologize.

533
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:48,038
I know that you always find
a way to do the right thing,

534
00:25:48,106 --> 00:25:49,873
and I am here for you.

535
00:25:49,942 --> 00:25:51,608
Whatever you need.

536
00:25:55,614 --> 00:25:57,013
Now come on.

537
00:25:57,082 --> 00:25:58,748
Let's go home.

538
00:26:27,145 --> 00:26:28,912
It's like a Shade orphanage.

539
00:26:28,981 --> 00:26:30,046
We should hurry.

540
00:26:30,115 --> 00:26:31,081
We're running out of time.

541
00:26:31,149 --> 00:26:32,716
We should split up.

542
00:26:32,784 --> 00:26:34,885
I kind of have a thing about
splitting up in houses

543
00:26:34,953 --> 00:26:36,586
full of creepy kids.

544
00:26:46,198 --> 00:26:47,831
Hey, can we ask you a question?

545
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,000
- Sure.
- What was that?

546
00:26:50,068 --> 00:26:51,668
That you just did with the money?

547
00:26:51,737 --> 00:26:54,070
For the little boy?

548
00:26:54,139 --> 00:26:55,238
What little boy?

549
00:26:55,307 --> 00:26:57,507
The little boy with the shitty dad.

550
00:26:57,576 --> 00:26:58,576
He ran away.

551
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:00,210
And now he's cold and hungry.

552
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:02,545
He'll find it on the sidewalk
any minute.

553
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:06,783
And that...

554
00:27:06,852 --> 00:27:08,551
She's in a hospital room.

555
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,920
She's making them bloom.

556
00:27:09,988 --> 00:27:13,023
It's a really obvious miracle,
but that's okay.

557
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:15,258
The girl in the room
is gonna die anyways.

558
00:27:15,327 --> 00:27:17,160
So you're all making miracles.

559
00:27:17,229 --> 00:27:19,562
Just little tiny ones, though.

560
00:27:19,631 --> 00:27:20,931
Cool.

561
00:27:20,999 --> 00:27:23,667
Um, we were looking for a Shade.

562
00:27:23,735 --> 00:27:28,004
- Her name's Julia.
- Yeah, uh, she looks like her.

563
00:27:28,073 --> 00:27:29,839
Kind of. Um, and...

564
00:27:29,908 --> 00:27:31,574
Well, she's a... she's a mess.

565
00:27:31,643 --> 00:27:34,110
We all were when we got here.

566
00:27:34,179 --> 00:27:35,278
Anything else?

567
00:27:35,347 --> 00:27:37,380
Um, she's brave.

568
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:40,050
And funny, and she probably made friends

569
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:42,719
with some of the most shy,
maladjusted Shades.

570
00:27:42,788 --> 00:27:46,256
She's curious, and she won't
take no for an answer.

571
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:50,026
Are you looking for the kind of new one,

572
00:27:50,095 --> 00:27:52,662
who's always getting in trouble
and sneaking into

573
00:27:52,731 --> 00:27:54,531
Ms. Persephone's room...
because, you know,

574
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:56,466
we're never supposed to go in there.

575
00:27:57,502 --> 00:28:00,570
Yeah. Yeah, that does sound like her.

576
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:03,273
I just saw her. This way.

577
00:28:06,912 --> 00:28:08,011
Up those stairs.

578
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,879
Last door.

579
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,084
- Eugene?
- Yeah?

580
00:28:14,152 --> 00:28:15,785
Who's that?

581
00:28:15,854 --> 00:28:17,153
That's Ms. Persephone.

582
00:28:17,222 --> 00:28:19,322
She hasn't been here
for a really long time

583
00:28:19,391 --> 00:28:20,991
and no one knows where she is.

584
00:28:23,395 --> 00:28:25,729
Thank you so much for all your help.

585
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:33,536
That's Our Lady Underground.

586
00:28:33,605 --> 00:28:34,938
What?

587
00:28:35,007 --> 00:28:36,906
The one that you...

588
00:28:43,982 --> 00:28:47,350
So you were real all along, huh?

589
00:28:47,419 --> 00:28:49,819
Just completely AWOL.

590
00:28:49,888 --> 00:28:52,455
Self-centered bitch.

591
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:58,862
We were so stupid to love you.

592
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:00,597
Jules...

593
00:29:00,665 --> 00:29:02,966
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

594
00:29:03,035 --> 00:29:06,669
Look, I'm glad I know.

595
00:29:06,738 --> 00:29:08,772
It's always better to know, Q.

596
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,440
You keep watch.

597
00:29:10,509 --> 00:29:12,008
I'll sneak in and find the part of me

598
00:29:12,077 --> 00:29:13,643
that already snuck in.

599
00:29:13,712 --> 00:29:15,545
Hmm.

600
00:29:20,952 --> 00:29:22,685
We're under attack.

601
00:29:22,754 --> 00:29:26,423
The Rattening, now reports of
upside down rain.

602
00:29:26,491 --> 00:29:29,426
Correct... as well as ant hills
turning into volcanoes,

603
00:29:29,494 --> 00:29:32,062
the Balmy Sea turning to acid,

604
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:35,231
and the mysterious disappearance
of all blondes

605
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,966
in the province of Crickety Cove.

606
00:29:37,035 --> 00:29:40,570
The talking animals report
this includes palomino horses.

607
00:29:40,639 --> 00:29:43,406
Also, every chicken in Fillory
has laryngitis.

608
00:29:43,475 --> 00:29:46,876
Is there a pattern to any of this?

609
00:29:46,945 --> 00:29:48,278
None that we can tell.

610
00:29:48,346 --> 00:29:50,513
Only that whatever it is,
it is increasing.

611
00:29:50,582 --> 00:29:53,483
Idri's turned into a rat,
so it isn't the Lorians.

612
00:29:53,552 --> 00:29:56,052
We've incapacitated the FU Fighters.

613
00:29:56,121 --> 00:29:57,854
That leaves...

614
00:29:57,923 --> 00:29:59,756
the people in this room.

615
00:30:02,794 --> 00:30:04,327
Your Highness?

616
00:30:04,396 --> 00:30:06,362
If anyone has anything to say...

617
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:08,331
I'm embezzling funds
from the royal treasury.

618
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,200
- Why did I just say that?
- Hah!

619
00:30:10,268 --> 00:30:13,403
Because there's truth serum
in this wine.

620
00:30:13,472 --> 00:30:17,307
I've truthied you. Anyone else?

621
00:30:17,375 --> 00:30:20,276
Abigail and I have been using
the castle guards

622
00:30:20,345 --> 00:30:21,845
to run an escort service.

623
00:30:21,913 --> 00:30:23,546
Gross.

624
00:30:23,615 --> 00:30:24,981
But clever.

625
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:27,150
Doesn't help us.

626
00:30:27,219 --> 00:30:28,785
Should've made this stronger.

627
00:30:31,723 --> 00:30:33,156
It was me.

628
00:30:38,763 --> 00:30:41,598
I made a deal with the fairies
and I know where Fen is.

629
00:30:47,272 --> 00:30:50,607
You got to be kidding me.

630
00:30:50,675 --> 00:30:52,642
It's not your break.

631
00:30:55,347 --> 00:30:58,882
So what? You, uh... you gonna report me?

632
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:01,551
Answer a question, maybe I'll forget to.

633
00:31:03,588 --> 00:31:04,754
What's your question?

634
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:06,623
You trying to fuck that librarian?

635
00:31:06,691 --> 00:31:07,557
No!

636
00:31:07,626 --> 00:31:09,425
I saw you. You want to fuck her.

637
00:31:09,494 --> 00:31:10,927
You want to lick her butthole, huh?

638
00:31:10,996 --> 00:31:12,395
Whoa, Jesus, no!

639
00:31:12,464 --> 00:31:14,364
Then why are you scamming her so hard

640
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:17,233
that I nearly blew you?

641
00:31:17,302 --> 00:31:18,735
I just need her name, okay?

642
00:31:18,803 --> 00:31:20,603
Oh, why didn't you ask? Here.

643
00:31:23,475 --> 00:31:26,075
The "S" stands for Shot,
or maybe it's Schiff.

644
00:31:26,144 --> 00:31:27,777
Let me know if you find
anything gross in her book.

645
00:31:27,846 --> 00:31:29,812
I have a feeling she's a total
freak in the sack.

646
00:31:29,881 --> 00:31:31,080
Okay.

647
00:31:31,149 --> 00:31:32,448
What's your deal?

648
00:31:32,517 --> 00:31:35,218
- I have no deal.
- You're a child.

649
00:31:35,287 --> 00:31:36,553
Okay, Grandpa, that's a little...

650
00:31:36,621 --> 00:31:41,157
What are you even doing stuck here?

651
00:31:41,226 --> 00:31:43,693
What do they have on you?

652
00:31:43,762 --> 00:31:46,462
Nothing.

653
00:31:46,531 --> 00:31:47,997
Okay, fine, they're protecting me.

654
00:31:48,066 --> 00:31:50,900
Protecting you from what?

655
00:31:50,969 --> 00:31:53,670
My dad is a businessman

656
00:31:53,738 --> 00:31:56,139
and sometimes his competition
can get a little rough,

657
00:31:56,208 --> 00:31:57,540
so he sent me here.

658
00:31:57,609 --> 00:32:00,443
- Like, he's a...
- Legitimate businessman.

659
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,911
Can we please not talk about it?

660
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,514
My God, you're like
that whiny little kid

661
00:32:04,583 --> 00:32:07,050
in "The Sopranos," Willow.

662
00:32:07,118 --> 00:32:08,952
Jesus Christ, you are so lame.

663
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,553
Please.

664
00:32:12,023 --> 00:32:13,957
And her name was Meadow.

665
00:32:19,164 --> 00:32:21,064
You truthied me?

666
00:32:21,132 --> 00:32:22,999
I can't lie.

667
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:25,301
Eliot, I did this for you.

668
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:27,870
- There was no other way.
- Don't.

669
00:32:29,608 --> 00:32:32,342
You started this when you declared war.

670
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:35,278
Now my wife and child are gone.

671
00:32:35,347 --> 00:32:36,713
I need to deal with the rats.

672
00:32:36,781 --> 00:32:40,583
I can't risk having to
clean up your next mess.

673
00:32:45,257 --> 00:32:46,956
Guards.

674
00:32:47,025 --> 00:32:48,658
No, Eliot.

675
00:32:48,727 --> 00:32:52,362
- What are you doing?
- I don't know what else to do.

676
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:55,798
- Take her to the dungeon.
- No!

677
00:32:55,867 --> 00:32:58,468
Eliot...

678
00:32:58,536 --> 00:33:00,503
I'll fix this.

679
00:33:02,507 --> 00:33:05,575
Make sure she gets the best room.

680
00:33:05,644 --> 00:33:08,211
And see that she gets her coconut oil.

681
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,380
Good-bye, Margo.

682
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:21,624
Oh, shit!

683
00:33:44,349 --> 00:33:46,783
I know you're in there.

684
00:33:46,851 --> 00:33:48,318
Come out.

685
00:33:48,386 --> 00:33:50,253
It's okay.

686
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:51,821
It's me.

687
00:33:56,528 --> 00:33:58,361
Oh, my God.

688
00:34:02,742 --> 00:34:05,770
Julia, I found her she's...

689
00:34:07,632 --> 00:34:08,997
Quentin.

690
00:34:10,801 --> 00:34:13,568
I missed you so much.

691
00:34:13,637 --> 00:34:16,204
Oh, my God.

692
00:34:16,273 --> 00:34:17,572
Hi.

693
00:34:21,478 --> 00:34:23,445
Are you okay?

694
00:34:23,513 --> 00:34:25,080
Yeah. Are you?

695
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:27,649
Not really.

696
00:34:27,718 --> 00:34:29,317
Without you.

697
00:34:29,386 --> 00:34:32,253
Did you get Reynard yet?

698
00:34:32,322 --> 00:34:34,222
I'm trying.

699
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:44,966
She talks about him all the time.

700
00:34:45,035 --> 00:34:47,035
Says he's a good guy.

701
00:34:47,104 --> 00:34:49,604
Stupid sometimes, but good.

702
00:34:52,809 --> 00:34:55,210
Is there any way
we can take her with us too?

703
00:35:08,925 --> 00:35:11,559
I know you told security to keep me out,

704
00:35:11,628 --> 00:35:14,162
but then I suggested they let me in.

705
00:35:14,231 --> 00:35:16,564
Stalemate, I guess.

706
00:35:16,633 --> 00:35:18,233
Is this about Cowden?

707
00:35:18,301 --> 00:35:20,802
I think you just
overwhelmed him a little.

708
00:35:20,871 --> 00:35:23,471
I know it's a lot, but it's worth it.

709
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,640
My wife.

710
00:35:25,709 --> 00:35:28,076
Is anything about our relationship real?

711
00:35:28,145 --> 00:35:31,413
I've been controlling her
from the day we met, right?

712
00:35:31,481 --> 00:35:33,615
Yes. Lucky her.

713
00:35:33,683 --> 00:35:35,517
How is that?

714
00:35:35,585 --> 00:35:37,285
She's a person.

715
00:35:37,354 --> 00:35:38,553
Yes.

716
00:35:38,622 --> 00:35:39,888
And you're not.

717
00:35:39,956 --> 00:35:41,656
The sooner you wrap
your head around that...

718
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:43,892
No, no.

719
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,960
I don't want it.

720
00:35:45,028 --> 00:35:47,195
You want to be President

721
00:35:47,264 --> 00:35:49,364
of this entire idiotic country.

722
00:35:49,433 --> 00:35:51,766
You have always sensed your place.

723
00:35:51,835 --> 00:35:54,135
Julia and Kady, they said
you did terrible things.

724
00:35:54,204 --> 00:35:56,037
I should've looked you up on the spot.

725
00:35:56,106 --> 00:35:58,907
You didn't because I
gently suggested you don't.

726
00:35:58,975 --> 00:36:00,575
It's for your own good, kid.

727
00:36:00,644 --> 00:36:02,544
So it's all true.

728
00:36:02,612 --> 00:36:04,145
Those poor women.

729
00:36:04,214 --> 00:36:05,914
Those women were hardly victims.

730
00:36:05,982 --> 00:36:08,416
They said they were just
trying to summon a little help

731
00:36:08,485 --> 00:36:09,684
from some kind of goddess...

732
00:36:09,753 --> 00:36:12,954
They were summoning an evil bitch!

733
00:36:13,023 --> 00:36:14,989
You looked me up, says trickster.

734
00:36:15,058 --> 00:36:16,491
See, that's honest.

735
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,859
Yes, I fuck with the weak.

736
00:36:17,928 --> 00:36:19,527
You know what that does?
Improves the herd.

737
00:36:19,596 --> 00:36:22,263
I help the same little creatures
you want to help.

738
00:36:22,332 --> 00:36:23,932
It's not surprising, you're my son,

739
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,800
how else could it be but her?

740
00:36:25,869 --> 00:36:28,603
The benevolent "Our Lady Underground."

741
00:36:28,672 --> 00:36:30,271
It is all about her.

742
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:34,275
Power, attention, grinding men
and gods into the fucking dirt

743
00:36:34,344 --> 00:36:36,277
and then she leaves!

744
00:36:45,889 --> 00:36:49,691
You loved her.

745
00:36:49,759 --> 00:36:53,061
Guess there's some things
you can't control, after all.

746
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:56,898
I can see you're upset.

747
00:36:56,967 --> 00:36:58,733
But I need you to move past that.

748
00:36:58,802 --> 00:37:01,369
Stop worrying about humans.

749
00:37:01,438 --> 00:37:03,071
They're beneath you.

750
00:37:03,139 --> 00:37:05,874
This is your birthright, son.

751
00:37:05,942 --> 00:37:07,642
We're gonna do so much together.

752
00:37:11,581 --> 00:37:13,615
How'd you do it? You know, turn me back?

753
00:37:13,683 --> 00:37:15,316
A special Fillorian mint.

754
00:37:15,385 --> 00:37:17,986
And about 50 straight minutes
of casting,

755
00:37:18,054 --> 00:37:21,155
so I'm gonna need a minute to recharge.

756
00:37:21,224 --> 00:37:24,225
You sure you don't want
any clothes, or...

757
00:37:24,294 --> 00:37:25,727
Eh.

758
00:37:25,795 --> 00:37:26,915
Can't you get Margo to help?

759
00:37:26,963 --> 00:37:28,363
You know, give you a break?

760
00:37:28,431 --> 00:37:30,398
I kind of threw her in the dungeon.

761
00:37:30,467 --> 00:37:31,799
Got ya.

762
00:37:31,868 --> 00:37:33,768
Well, you'll run yourself dead,

763
00:37:33,837 --> 00:37:34,957
doing everything on your own.

764
00:37:35,005 --> 00:37:36,371
Believe me, I know.

765
00:37:36,439 --> 00:37:39,173
Pass some shit down the chain
to the governors

766
00:37:39,242 --> 00:37:44,012
or the dukes or whatever.

767
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,581
You don't have any governors?

768
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:48,149
No dukes?

769
00:37:48,218 --> 00:37:51,653
- Get you some delegates, son.
- Right, really good idea.

770
00:37:51,721 --> 00:37:54,188
Select governors.

771
00:37:54,257 --> 00:37:56,157
Yet another task for the High King.

772
00:37:56,226 --> 00:37:58,826
Or you just hold an election.

773
00:37:58,895 --> 00:38:02,931
Let the people pick their own,
you do nada.

774
00:38:02,999 --> 00:38:04,332
- That's...
- Stupid, is it stupid?

775
00:38:04,401 --> 00:38:06,100
- I'm sorry.
- Brilliant, Josh.

776
00:38:06,169 --> 00:38:09,003
I think you just invented democracy,

777
00:38:09,072 --> 00:38:10,872
and it's going to save Fillory.

778
00:38:10,941 --> 00:38:13,474
Well, high five, brother.

779
00:38:18,048 --> 00:38:21,316
- Eliot?
- What the hell?

780
00:38:23,153 --> 00:38:26,521
Dude, I thought you were
off being, like,

781
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:28,690
the High King of Fillory?

782
00:38:28,758 --> 00:38:31,059
I am.

783
00:38:31,127 --> 00:38:33,728
I was.

784
00:38:33,797 --> 00:38:36,132
I think I just got kicked out.

785
00:38:45,978 --> 00:38:48,145
Of course her book is relocated

786
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,314
to the Poison Room.

787
00:38:50,349 --> 00:38:51,682
Okay.

788
00:38:51,717 --> 00:38:53,550
So what's our next move?

789
00:38:53,586 --> 00:38:55,119
Admit I'm fucking cursed?

790
00:38:55,154 --> 00:38:56,120
Is this all you guys do?

791
00:38:56,155 --> 00:38:57,554
Talk about your fee-fees?

792
00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:00,023
I was kind of hoping
you'd get to fucking.

793
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:01,392
How did you...

794
00:39:01,427 --> 00:39:04,094
Oh, hopped into your mind
when you hopped into hers.

795
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:05,662
It's a little trick
my dad's friends taught me.

796
00:39:05,698 --> 00:39:08,732
Your dad's friends are perverts?

797
00:39:08,768 --> 00:39:10,367
Thugs. Magic mobsters.

798
00:39:10,403 --> 00:39:11,468
- No, they're not.
- Jesus.

799
00:39:11,504 --> 00:39:12,736
Which is why I'm leaving.

800
00:39:12,772 --> 00:39:14,938
- So's Willow.
- Meadow, doofus.

801
00:39:14,974 --> 00:39:15,939
Fine, kick me out.

802
00:39:15,975 --> 00:39:17,541
You really don't need my help.

803
00:39:17,576 --> 00:39:18,876
Help with what?

804
00:39:18,911 --> 00:39:21,445
Trying to break into the Poison Room.

805
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,047
I've been in your crappy Nolan
movie for, like, 20 minutes.

806
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:25,482
I heard everything.

807
00:39:25,518 --> 00:39:27,017
Been trying to get in there
myself, 'cause, you know,

808
00:39:27,052 --> 00:39:28,786
I'm curious about a few things.

809
00:39:28,821 --> 00:39:30,754
So you can either start from
square one on your own,

810
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:33,991
or you can hop the line and join...

811
00:39:35,528 --> 00:39:37,394
Well, the pervy mob girl has a point.

812
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:39,530
No. It's dangerous.

813
00:39:39,565 --> 00:39:42,099
You know what's safe? Nothing.

814
00:39:42,134 --> 00:39:43,667
You're not responsible for me, okay?

815
00:39:43,702 --> 00:39:47,237
Free will, I exercise that shit.

816
00:39:47,273 --> 00:39:48,338
I'm gonna hate this.

817
00:39:48,374 --> 00:39:49,773
You hate everything.

818
00:39:49,809 --> 00:39:52,075
That's why I like you.

819
00:39:52,111 --> 00:39:54,678
Kady. Kady!

820
00:39:54,713 --> 00:39:56,647
Kady, wake up.

821
00:39:59,385 --> 00:40:01,118
- Kady.
- Hey.

822
00:40:01,153 --> 00:40:04,621
- What?
- Hey, you, uh, you got a guest.

823
00:40:05,925 --> 00:40:08,826
Professor Lipson told me
to bring him here.

824
00:40:12,565 --> 00:40:15,032
If you're still after Reynard,

825
00:40:15,067 --> 00:40:17,000
I want in.

826
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,739
Eliot?

827
00:40:25,311 --> 00:40:26,777
Oh, you.

828
00:40:26,812 --> 00:40:29,713
I shouldn't be here, but...

829
00:40:31,851 --> 00:40:34,384
Please. Your Majesty.

830
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,987
- Be careful.
- So not a nice scotch, then?

831
00:40:37,022 --> 00:40:41,358
It will transport you
to the fairy realm.

832
00:40:41,393 --> 00:40:44,761
I must warn you, few return.

833
00:40:44,797 --> 00:40:48,098
But it is a chance to save Fen,

834
00:40:48,133 --> 00:40:50,434
the baby.

835
00:40:50,469 --> 00:40:52,002
I would go, but...

836
00:40:52,037 --> 00:40:54,505
You're a pussy who's in love
with a sloth,

837
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,840
who's currently a rat.

838
00:40:56,876 --> 00:41:00,777
And end of the day,
it's my mess to clean up.

839
00:41:00,813 --> 00:41:02,846
Tell Eliot that.

840
00:41:12,658 --> 00:41:14,625
Q, it's time.

841
00:41:16,629 --> 00:41:18,729
This is it.

842
00:41:18,764 --> 00:41:20,397
It's who I couldn't make the math work.

843
00:41:20,432 --> 00:41:21,632
What math?

844
00:41:21,667 --> 00:41:23,267
Uh, the spell to bring Alice back.

845
00:41:23,302 --> 00:41:25,502
I knew something was missing,
I just didn't know...

846
00:41:25,538 --> 00:41:29,540
It was me.

847
00:41:29,575 --> 00:41:31,275
You have to go now.

848
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:33,277
There's a portal in there,

849
00:41:33,312 --> 00:41:35,178
back to reception.

850
00:41:35,214 --> 00:41:37,481
And I'm glad we got to say good-bye.

851
00:41:40,986 --> 00:41:43,754
Um, I'm gonna be back here
for good one day,

852
00:41:43,789 --> 00:41:47,157
and I am going to find you.

853
00:41:51,163 --> 00:41:52,696
Okay.

854
00:42:02,174 --> 00:42:03,473
You first.

855
00:42:23,195 --> 00:42:26,096
- Jules, what the hell?
- This isn't up for debate.

856
00:42:26,131 --> 00:42:27,631
We came here so that you could...

857
00:42:27,666 --> 00:42:29,633
Yeah? So?

858
00:42:29,668 --> 00:42:31,635
Things change.

859
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:33,303
- If you do this...
- I know.

860
00:42:33,339 --> 00:42:35,172
This is my one shot.

861
00:42:35,207 --> 00:42:36,940
And this is what I want to do with it.

862
00:42:36,976 --> 00:42:38,909
I found them! Stop!

863
00:42:38,944 --> 00:42:40,210
Come on, or we'll lose her, too.

864
00:42:40,245 --> 00:42:41,612
You can't take that Shade!

865
00:42:41,647 --> 00:42:43,680
Hey! Stop!

866
00:42:43,716 --> 00:42:46,216
It's all going to be okay, Quentin.
