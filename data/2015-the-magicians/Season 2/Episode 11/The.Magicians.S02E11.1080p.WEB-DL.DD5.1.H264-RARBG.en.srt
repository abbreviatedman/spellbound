00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:03,335
<i>- Previously on
"The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:03,337 --> 00:00:05,070
<i>- My hands won't cast.</i>

3
00:00:05,072 --> 00:00:07,206
- We can help you, penny.
- What's the catch?

4
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:08,407
"Bound in service to the library

5
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:10,509
up to and after my death"?

6
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:13,078
<i>- That isn't just any door.
- Then what is it?</i>

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,179
- The poison room.

8
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,447
There is knowledge
behind that door

9
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:17,216
that could destroy
more than just people.

10
00:00:17,218 --> 00:00:18,417
It could destroy worlds.

11
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:20,219
<i>- "The ars deicidium"?</i>

12
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:22,087
<i>- "The art of killing gods."</i>

13
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:24,423
- King Idri is our
honored guest.

14
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:25,758
<i>We're getting married.</i>

15
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,360
One big, royal
polyamorous family.

16
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,462
- The fairies can bring back
the wellspring?

17
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,463
- They can.

18
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:33,232
- And in return?

19
00:00:33,234 --> 00:00:35,200
<i>- The child that grows
in the womb</i>

20
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:37,036
<i>of the high king's wife.</i>

21
00:00:37,038 --> 00:00:39,772
<i>- Some friends
and I summoned a goddess.</i>

22
00:00:39,774 --> 00:00:42,374
- You may address me
as Reynard the fox,

23
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,276
<i>trickster of the very stupid.</i>

24
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:46,812
<i>- Reynard's son is John Gaines?</i>

25
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:48,447
<i>- My son...</i>

26
00:00:50,283 --> 00:00:52,384
<i>- Jules, I talked to your shade.</i>

27
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:53,552
She's not gone.

28
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:55,220
- So where is she?

29
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:57,256
- Shades go to the underworld.

30
00:00:57,258 --> 00:00:59,158
The living can access
the underworld

31
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,325
with the help of a gatekeeper.

32
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:04,196
- I think I figured out
what an ancient one is.

33
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:12,571
- Look, Q, you don't have to
come with me.

34
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:15,474
In fact,
I don't think that you should.

35
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:18,444
- Noted, but I'm coming.

36
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:20,846
You feel the energy
coming off that?

37
00:01:20,848 --> 00:01:23,549
- Yeah, also the stink.

38
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,822
- I don't know, my ancient Greek
is a little rusty.

39
00:01:29,824 --> 00:01:32,357
- "The old reveals itself
to the new

40
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:35,561
at the fall of milk teeth."

41
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:37,596
Milk teeth?

42
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:39,431
- Oh, baby teeth.

43
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,867
You think we have to
stick one in to open it up?

44
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:43,435
- I mean, I could write a spell.

45
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:46,105
Uh, we could find
the nearest child's house

46
00:01:46,107 --> 00:01:47,306
expecting the tooth fairy and...

47
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:49,875
- break in
and steal their teeth?

48
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:52,377
- I'd leave money.

49
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:55,481
- Uh, I hate to bring this up,
but I actually...

50
00:01:55,483 --> 00:01:57,182
I still have one...

51
00:01:57,184 --> 00:01:58,450
A molar that never came in.

52
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,519
- Oh,
I know an extraction spell.

53
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:01,553
- Ah!

54
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:03,522
- Fuck!
- Sorry.

55
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:08,660
- This dragon better be
fucking cool.

56
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:18,470
- Hmm...

57
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,639
Or not.

58
00:02:37,357 --> 00:02:39,458
- I wouldn't have guessed
baby teeth.

59
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,927
Why would a dragon want
baby teeth?

60
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:45,664
- Shit.
<i>- I collect baby teeth.</i>

61
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,267
<i>As I collect many things,
little mammal.</i>

62
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,741
- uh, greetings, your ladyship.

63
00:02:55,743 --> 00:02:57,676
<i>- "Your ladyship"?</i>

64
00:02:57,678 --> 00:03:00,679
<i>I am a queen of the great worms.</i>

65
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,648
- Of course you are.

66
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,284
Uh, that's awesome... I wasn't
suggesting that you weren't.

67
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:08,220
<i>- Your manner does not endear
me to you, human.</i>

68
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:14,726
- We seek passage to the
underworld, oh ancient one.

69
00:03:17,398 --> 00:03:20,232
<i>- Hmm.
- You seek to die.</i>

70
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:24,436
- Uh, no, actually, we were
hoping to come back after.

71
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:26,505
<i>- Suit yourself.</i>

72
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:28,574
I require a gift.

73
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:31,276
- A gift?
- Um...

74
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:32,644
Yeah, I mean, name it,

75
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,613
and we'll get it for you.

76
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:37,716
- You already have it.

77
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:40,285
It's in your pocket.

78
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,229
- No.
- Pick something else.

79
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:52,231
- No, if it gets you
your shade back...

80
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:53,665
- no.

81
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,567
Fillory is your home.

82
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,369
And what about your friends?
What if they need you?

83
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:59,304
We can't.

84
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,509
- Queen of the great worms.

85
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:06,645
What if I, uh,
needed to borrow it

86
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:08,647
in the future,
just super briefly?

87
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:10,015
<i>- No.</i>

88
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:11,717
If you wish to return home,

89
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,752
you must find other means.

90
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:17,522
<i>The first door remains open,
little mammal.</i>

91
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:21,793
- Great, um,
I super love riddles.

92
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:31,303
- Are you giving me
the button or not?

93
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:43,649
- Your bodies will stay here,
and your souls will travel.

94
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:46,018
You have 24 hours
to return to the portal.

95
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,619
- Or?

96
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:51,023
- I sit patiently,
waiting for you to come back.

97
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:54,760
No, I eat you... I'm a fucking
dragon, what do you expect?

98
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:56,461
- Great, good to know.

99
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,298
- Then it's settled.

100
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,372
- Jesus,
a little warning next time.

101
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,541
- Really.

102
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:12,678
Q, look.

103
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,446
<i>- Time to go.</i>

104
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,651
Fucking millennials.

105
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:45,477
- Welcome to the underworld.

106
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:49,815
Please take a number.

107
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:56,555
- The fuck?

108
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:13,905
- Idri is almost here.

109
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:17,109
And does anyone know
where fen is?

110
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:24,716
- I present king Idri of Loria.

111
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,956
- My life is perfect.

112
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,591
Hello.

113
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:34,593
Josh... wine, canapÃ©s.

114
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:36,428
I said have it ready.

115
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,930
- We have a lovely blend of...

116
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:40,432
<i>Ahem. Okay.</i>

117
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:41,600
- And where are
the fire dancers?

118
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:44,736
I don't know.

119
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,471
I'm sorry,
I had a whole thing...

120
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:47,939
- your majesty,
this presentation

121
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:50,976
is beautiful, but...

122
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:53,478
- It would be so much better
with fire dancers, I know.

123
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,881
- I hope my arrival isn't
causing undue stress.

124
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:57,783
- Stress?

125
00:06:57,785 --> 00:07:00,786
- I'm not stressed...
- Eliot.

126
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:03,855
- I don't care about ceremony.
- You don't?

127
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:07,459
- But...
- but I came here for you.

128
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:10,996
- Oh.

129
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:12,964
Well...

130
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:16,501
The feeling's mutual.

131
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:21,006
- Take me somewhere we can
become a bit better acquainted.

132
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:23,041
Alone.

133
00:07:26,512 --> 00:07:28,914
- Congratulations, you're dead.

134
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:32,651
You've passed through the veil
to the underworld.

135
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:34,519
<i>Is this your final destination?</i>

136
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:35,887
<i>No.</i>

137
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:37,923
<i>It's the first leg
of your journey.</i>

138
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:41,226
<i>We designed this part
of the underworld for you,</i>

139
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:43,728
<i>based on your life
and personal expectations</i>

140
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,798
<i>to facilitate a comfortable
transition.</i>

141
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,669
<i>You've been grouped with others
who have similar expectations.</i>

142
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:51,903
<i>Perfect, right?</i>

143
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:55,207
- Ow.
- What?

144
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:57,976
<i>- Settle into this
next stage of your existence.</i>

145
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:00,545
<i>In the unlikely event
you're missing your shade,</i>

146
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,948
<i>please report to
a bellhop immediately.</i>

147
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,050
<i>Enjoy your wait.</i>

148
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,522
- I guess we need to
find a bellhop.

149
00:08:10,524 --> 00:08:11,923
<i>- Security,
we have a shade-less patron!</i>

150
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,592
<i>- What?
- Hey!</i>

151
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:14,860
- Take him away.
- Why? Where are you taking me?

152
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:16,995
- Thank you, thank you.
- Read me my rights!

153
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:19,498
Hey, let go!
Wait, ow!

154
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,933
- Or, you know, we take a beat.

155
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:23,768
- 173.

156
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:27,072
- I'm 173.

157
00:08:27,074 --> 00:08:28,607
- Place your hands
on the counter

158
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:30,876
for identification, please.

159
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:36,882
- Hey, do you know where they
were taking that guy just now?

160
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:40,652
- Oh, his soul is missing
a little piece.

161
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:41,887
They just took him
somewhere where

162
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:43,722
he would be more comfortable.

163
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:45,056
- So he could be
reunited with it?

164
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:46,958
- I doubt it, that's very
difficult to do.

165
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,528
Especially after
a prolonged separation.

166
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,729
- Yeah,
but you can't just take...

167
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:52,097
- I assure you, all the shades

168
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:55,600
are safe and well protected
for their eternity.

169
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:57,602
Nothing to worry over.

170
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:58,770
Ah, here we are.

171
00:08:58,772 --> 00:09:01,740
Wicker and Coldwater.

172
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:03,608
Oh.

173
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,876
Oh, my.

174
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:12,851
- What?
- You've both died 39 times.

175
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:15,687
Aha... time loop.
Thought so.

176
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:18,123
Our computers do not
handle these well.

177
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:21,026
This will take a bit
to sort out.

178
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:22,961
Once you're in the system,
we'll reunite you

179
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:24,629
with your immediate
karmic circle,

180
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:26,631
but until then, I'll need to
stick you somewhere.

181
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:27,966
Do you like skiing?

182
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:29,901
- Look, I thought
this was just a waystation.

183
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,037
- We're kind of in a hurry...
- oh, it is.

184
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:34,839
But souls do stay a while,

185
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:37,576
until they're ready to...

186
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:38,910
Move on.

187
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,979
Snorkeling?
Art museums?

188
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:43,915
- Actually, is it possible
to check on a few names?

189
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,952
I think I might have
a karmic circle we could visit.

190
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:57,696
- You're making progress.

191
00:09:57,698 --> 00:09:58,863
- Am I?

192
00:09:58,865 --> 00:10:00,966
Nothing's happening.

193
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:03,835
- It's an exceedingly
difficult way to do magic.

194
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:06,938
Trying to isolate muscles not
generally associated with...

195
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,873
- call it what it is.

196
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,742
Sphincter magic.

197
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:12,143
Gets me there, no shame.

198
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:13,712
- And if it doesn't,

199
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:15,880
we all need
a healthy pelvic floor.

200
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:17,782
Now, I'm afraid
study time is over.

201
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,718
I have your next job.

202
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,354
- Re-shelving books.
- Great.

203
00:10:22,356 --> 00:10:24,789
- Any questions,
direct them to...

204
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:25,924
Where'd she go?

205
00:10:25,926 --> 00:10:27,726
- Sylvia!
<i>- What?</i>

206
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:29,060
- Shh!

207
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:37,102
Penny, Sylvia.
Sylvia, penny.

208
00:10:37,104 --> 00:10:38,970
- So what, I'm babysitting now?

209
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,105
- Oh, no.

210
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:41,840
Sylvia is your supervisor.

211
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:44,009
Good luck, I'll check back.

212
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:49,114
- Nice scarf.

213
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:55,687
- Anyway, I married fen
because I had to.

214
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:58,923
But I didn't know her at all.

215
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:01,660
And now...

216
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:04,796
I don't know you.

217
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:06,431
- My wife used to say,
there's one way

218
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:10,235
to learn to be with
another person.

219
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:12,404
- The hard way?

220
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:15,140
- Actually, yes.

221
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:16,908
Stand up.

222
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:25,116
Would you mind removing this?

223
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,959
Buttons, too, please.

224
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:40,165
- What are you doing?
- Shh.

225
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:43,868
This is a lesson.

226
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:47,072
All of them.

227
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:48,473
Please.

228
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:54,813
- I really hate
to bring this up,

229
00:11:54,815 --> 00:11:58,249
but you do realize there's
nothing we can actually do.

230
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:00,118
- Oh, I know.

231
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,189
And yet,
there's so much we can do.

232
00:12:06,193 --> 00:12:08,827
I can't touch you,

233
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:11,196
you can't touch me,

234
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:14,833
but I can tell you
how I want to touch you.

235
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:18,903
And you can show me
how you like to be touched.

236
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,906
- I admire your
commitment to education.

237
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:26,878
If you're waiting for
my permission, don't.

238
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:40,024
What the fuck?

239
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:43,895
Eliot, Heloise just
turned into a rat!

240
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,065
Who is that?

241
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:51,035
- I'm not getting laid
tonight, am I?

242
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:57,208
- This is all of them?
- We can't be sure.

243
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,777
So many people have vanished

244
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,912
and there are so many rats
in the castle already.

245
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:03,815
Well, one of 'em has to be fen.

246
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:05,917
Okay, bottom line it for me.

247
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,252
What the fuck is going on?

248
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:08,787
- I'm sorry, your highness.

249
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,889
But this magic,
I've never seen it before.

250
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:14,259
- Abigail?
- If you can hear me, squeak.

251
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:15,994
Let me know you're okay.

252
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:19,831
Why didn't I study
how to speak rat in school?

253
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,001
- Okay, search the castle.

254
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:24,202
Find every rat.

255
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:25,904
And then council meeting.

256
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:28,506
Or what's left of the council.

257
00:13:48,962 --> 00:13:50,361
- What do we call that?

258
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:52,030
- Mm...

259
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:54,966
In-sex-tion?

260
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:57,535
- Inter-cepti-course?

261
00:13:57,537 --> 00:14:00,572
Incepti-sex.

262
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:02,941
"Incepti-sex."

263
00:14:02,943 --> 00:14:05,210
I like that.

264
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:08,346
That said,
I like real life better.

265
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,582
- Mm.

266
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:14,319
- But at least this way, we
don't have to get up for beers.

267
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:19,958
- Thank you.

268
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,898
- So, no pressure,

269
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,400
but...

270
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:30,902
Any word on the poison room?

271
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:32,337
- Believe me,
I want to get in there.

272
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:33,972
It's... it's above my pay grade.

273
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:36,007
I need a code to get in.

274
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:37,642
- Well, what about
that librarian?

275
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:39,377
- Oh, man, if she has the code,

276
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,279
it is locked down tighter
than a nun's pussy.

277
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:43,281
- Right, of course it is.

278
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:46,985
Hey, does she have
a book of her?

279
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:49,988
- Everyone has a book.

280
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,055
You're thinking...

281
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,658
- If the room
is that important...

282
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,094
- it's in her book.

283
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:57,528
Okay.

284
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,564
I can work on that.

285
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,666
Hey, what's up with the senator?

286
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:03,101
- He went back to work.

287
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:04,602
He made up some bullshit excuse

288
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:06,004
about the kidnapping.

289
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:08,006
All the news outlets bought it.

290
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:09,674
But hey, get this...

291
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:12,410
I saw Reynard in the back of
a press photo.

292
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,946
In a suit,
like an advisor or something.

293
00:15:14,948 --> 00:15:16,981
- Are you kidding me?

294
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:19,350
- He's a trickster.

295
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:21,019
Guess that includes his own son.

296
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:22,420
- Jesus Christ.

297
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:25,657
- We can't get one more vote?

298
00:15:25,659 --> 00:15:27,926
- We're in touch with
Matthews, Bauer, Wheeler.

299
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:30,295
Just give 'em a couple of days,
they'll come to their senses.

300
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:31,629
- Call in senator Cowden.

301
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:33,431
- Why bother?
- He won't budge.

302
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,633
- We can change his mind.
- Trust me.

303
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:38,002
- How?

304
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:40,138
- Everyone, give us a minute.

305
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:48,579
- So they're taking
your orders now?

306
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:49,948
- Have been for a while.

307
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,050
I controlled their minds.

308
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:55,019
Just like you have,
many, many times.

309
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:56,587
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

310
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:58,623
- You know you have that power.

311
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,326
You've been using it
your whole life.

312
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:04,662
- I always thought
I had some kind of...

313
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:08,333
God-level good luck.

314
00:16:08,335 --> 00:16:11,069
- True, you've only used it
instinctively,

315
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:12,704
but I'm here now.

316
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:14,706
I can teach you
how to use it at will.

317
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:16,541
Easy.

318
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:18,643
And once you've mastered it,

319
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:21,412
that's how you get
Cowden's vote.

320
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:22,747
- I don't know that
I want to do that.

321
00:16:22,749 --> 00:16:25,683
- It feels like cheating.
- They all don't cheat?

322
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:27,986
Everyone uses whatever
they've got, John,

323
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,088
and the bad ones don't hesitate.

324
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,489
So someone like you,

325
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,424
someone who wants to do some

326
00:16:33,426 --> 00:16:35,493
actual good in the world,

327
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:38,496
how can you not?

328
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,565
Here's all you have to do.

329
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:42,600
Look at me.

330
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,505
You look him
straight in the eye,

331
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:50,208
and you tell him, plainly.

332
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,610
Directly.

333
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:55,013
- That's it?

334
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:58,182
- It's that simple.

335
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,018
Good luck with the meeting,
senator.

336
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:14,198
- Why would anyone
want their afterlife

337
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,701
to look like a terrible
middle school birthday party?

338
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,436
- Is this about your "incident"?

339
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:20,405
- I moved on.
- Have you?

340
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:21,806
- Julia?
- Julia!

341
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:23,808
- Julia!
- Oh, welcome!

342
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,177
Welcome!

343
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:27,712
- Where's bender?
- Is he okay?

344
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,480
- He's great.
- He moved on.

345
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:32,183
- Uh, who's your friend,
and what's his shoe size?

346
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:34,252
- Uh, we're not really
here to bowl.

347
00:17:34,254 --> 00:17:36,154
- Kid, the first rule
of being dead,

348
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:38,189
if you're here, ya bowl.

349
00:17:38,191 --> 00:17:39,690
- We're actually not dead,
either.

350
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,125
Uh, we're here because
we need your help.

351
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:42,794
<i>- Julia?</i>

352
00:17:49,768 --> 00:17:52,270
What?

353
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:53,704
- Nothing.

354
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:55,706
It's... it's good to see you,
Richard.

355
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:58,176
- I mean, the real you.
- The real me?

356
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:00,511
What happened?

357
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:01,679
- I need your help.

358
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:03,748
I need to find my shade.

359
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,516
- Okay.

360
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:11,189
- The underworld is massive.
- There's every ecosystem.

361
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:13,357
Nearest we can tell,
about 2,000 islands

362
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,159
built to look like Hawaii.

363
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:16,394
- And you went with
a bowling alley?

364
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:17,395
- Fuck yeah.

365
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:18,629
- And the powers that be

366
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:21,099
are into whatever
helps us settle in

367
00:18:21,101 --> 00:18:22,600
so that we can move on.

368
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,602
- Ow, yeah!
- Whoo!

369
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:27,171
- "Powers that be"?
- Yeah. Gods.

370
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:28,639
We were right about
them being real.

371
00:18:28,641 --> 00:18:30,374
Hades created the underworld,

372
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:31,742
runs it with his wife,
Persephone.

373
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:34,512
They live in a big house
way over here.

374
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:37,215
It's a beautiful area
called Elysium.

375
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:39,383
- Apparently, they used to
come and go like clockwork

376
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:41,686
every fall and spring,
but a while back,

377
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:43,321
they just disappeared.

378
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:46,390
- Wait, why are you
doing all this, Richard?

379
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:48,659
I know you.
This is a project.

380
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:50,561
- I'm trying to find my son.

381
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:53,297
I don't know where he is,
if he's even still here.

382
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,732
But he's got to be somewhere.

383
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:57,535
And they won't tell me
a damn thing.

384
00:18:57,537 --> 00:18:59,770
- Why not?

385
00:18:59,772 --> 00:19:03,274
- I'm flagged as culpable
in his death.

386
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:04,675
There are rules.

387
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:07,145
And friends to help me
break them.

388
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:11,249
- Okay, so wait, so where
do they keep the shades?

389
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:12,583
- Sorry, we don't know that yet.

390
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:14,152
- So we're flying blind?

391
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:16,420
- Hun,
you're gonna have to bowl.

392
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:18,356
- No, look, I had an incident
when I was a kid.

393
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:20,224
- My fingers got stuck in the...
- oh, get over it.

394
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:21,526
Your girl would.

395
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:23,561
- She's not my girl.
- No shit.

396
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:25,263
She's tough as granite.

397
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:27,365
And you're afraid to bowl.

398
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:28,432
- Fine.

399
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:37,308
- How long before the dragon
eats you and Quentin?

400
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,210
- Tomorrow morning.

401
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:40,478
- Always the one
to tell the impossible

402
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,712
to go fuck itself, huh?

403
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:45,483
- Yeah, well,
it doesn't always listen.

404
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:47,585
- They'll know where the shades
are kept at reception.

405
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:49,720
- I don't know,
they didn't seem too keen

406
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:52,356
on helping out a person
who looked like this.

407
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,426
Shit, it seems to be closing up

408
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:57,495
much faster down here.

409
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:59,263
- Okay, so we hurry.

410
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:01,232
But just... not for nothing,
reception isn't keen

411
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:03,668
to help much of anyone... I can't
count the number of times

412
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:07,772
I've been kicked out of there,
trying to find my little boy.

413
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:10,575
- I have an idea.
- Oh, my god, Julia!

414
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:12,577
I... I got a strike.

415
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:13,578
- Whoo!

416
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,479
Yeah, q!

417
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:17,515
- The thing about the
underworld is, the first week,

418
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:19,417
it's always a strike.

419
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:24,355
- Let him have this one.

420
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:26,257
Whoo!
Go, q!

421
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:27,358
Ow!

422
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:37,368
- You wanted to talk?
- You lying son of a bitch.

423
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:40,871
You turned fen into a rat,
along with half the castle.

424
00:20:40,873 --> 00:20:42,807
- Fen is in her human form,

425
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:44,709
in the fairy realm.

426
00:20:44,711 --> 00:20:46,377
And she was taken
because you tried to

427
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:47,645
get clever with our deal.

428
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:50,848
- So you turned half my staff
into snake food?

429
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,384
- That wasn't the fairies.
- Oh.

430
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:56,687
Well, it sure smells like
their whimsical bullshit.

431
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:00,258
- "Whimsical."

432
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,826
It's the mark of the stupid
and the arrogant

433
00:21:01,828 --> 00:21:04,262
to attack what you can't
comprehend.

434
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:05,763
- Fine.

435
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,598
Get it out of your system.

436
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,734
Then if you know
what's going on,

437
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:11,802
just tell me.

438
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:13,771
- I take it back.

439
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:17,275
You're not entirely
simple-minded.

440
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:18,576
There's another power,

441
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:20,645
which you made the mistake
of overlooking.

442
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:22,680
- You want to be specific,
or not?

443
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:24,715
- A power without logic.

444
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:28,886
A power that acts, not for gain,
but solely because it can.

445
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:31,622
That's the true danger.

446
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,424
Face that.

447
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:35,793
Or face the end of your kingdom.

448
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,338
- Uh, hey.

449
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,341
- I got a question for you.
- Of course.

450
00:21:50,343 --> 00:21:52,343
How can I help?

451
00:21:52,345 --> 00:21:55,680
- You know,
I never got your name.

452
00:21:55,682 --> 00:21:58,582
- You may call me
head librarian.

453
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:01,552
And, uh...

454
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:04,555
What do I get to call you
outside of work?

455
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:06,624
- I see what you're getting at.

456
00:22:06,626 --> 00:22:09,527
But interoffice courtship
is expressly prohibited.

457
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:11,729
I'm flattered,
but rules are rule.

458
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:13,597
- Are they?

459
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:16,701
Always?

460
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:19,503
- Penny, please don't
take it personally,

461
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:22,373
but you're not my type.

462
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:24,608
You're a touch
emotionally insecure,

463
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:27,545
for which you compensate heavily
with boisterousness

464
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:29,914
and foul language.

465
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:31,949
I'm here if you need
anything else.

466
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,765
- Hey, guys.
- Mr. Corrigan.

467
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:49,667
Uh, Mr. Corrigan, you have
no need to be in here.

468
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:50,901
- Just a couple of questions.

469
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:52,837
- I'm gonna take a number.
- Please, sir.

470
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,905
- Um, you know what, I'm gonna
take a couple of numbers,

471
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:57,408
just in case I don't...
I don't hear the first number.

472
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:58,776
<i>Yeah, wow, you guys got
a lot of numbers.</i>

473
00:22:58,778 --> 00:23:00,511
- Mr. Corrigan,
I beseech you.

474
00:23:00,513 --> 00:23:02,380
- Oh, no, does this thing
run out of numbers?

475
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:03,981
- There we go.
- Playtime's over, Mr. Corrigan.

476
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:05,783
<i>- I'm not playing,
I really have questions.</i>

477
00:23:05,785 --> 00:23:07,518
<i>- Quite the jokester you are.
- That is it.</i>

478
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,787
- Security!
- Don't call security, Thomas.

479
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:11,655
- Security!
- Oh, no, security.

480
00:23:11,657 --> 00:23:13,557
<i>- They're on their way.
- No, no, no.</i>

481
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,526
<i>- I'm just getting a number here.
- Ha ha, very funny.</i>

482
00:23:15,528 --> 00:23:17,528
<i>- Does this thing
run out of numbers?</i>

483
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,996
- It's locked.

484
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:22,400
<i>Security!</i>

485
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:23,934
- "Disconnected shade."
- Where?

486
00:23:23,936 --> 00:23:25,403
- It doesn't say.

487
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:28,839
Just says "E."

488
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:30,841
Another one,
"disconnected shade, 'E.'"

489
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:33,878
- wait, if they all say "E"...

490
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,913
- Elysium.
- Yes.

491
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,983
- Okay, great, it's the complete
opposite end of the underworld.

492
00:23:38,985 --> 00:23:41,685
- Take him away for
disciplinary processing.

493
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:43,020
- Thank you.
- There's no need, guys.

494
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:44,855
Okay, you got me.

495
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:48,559
- Hope you had some fun to make
your confinement worthwhile.

496
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:50,694
- Oh, what's a few weeks
out of eternity?

497
00:23:58,571 --> 00:24:00,971
- This is books for school kids.

498
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:02,506
- If it's so important,

499
00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:04,942
finding me that five mil
can't be too hard.

500
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,710
- I'm not adding
another amendment.

501
00:24:06,712 --> 00:24:08,879
- You invited me in.

502
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:11,482
You knew what you were
getting into.

503
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:13,451
- Right.

504
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:24,829
You're going to support
this bill.

505
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:28,032
In fact, your yes will be
the first vote cast.

506
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:35,539
- John, this bill should've
been passed a long time ago.

507
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:38,709
And I'm sorry for trying to
drag you into the ditch on this.

508
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:41,545
You have my vote.

509
00:24:41,547 --> 00:24:43,747
- Then I thank you
for your help.

510
00:24:45,684 --> 00:24:46,817
You all right?

511
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,922
- Let me get you some water.

512
00:24:51,924 --> 00:24:55,025
- I... I must've
stood up too fast.

513
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:57,895
Here you go.

514
00:24:57,897 --> 00:24:59,597
I... I need to make a...

515
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:00,898
- Becca!

516
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,667
Becca, get the doctor.
Get the doctor now!

517
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:09,039
- John, I'm sorry,
. But...

518
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:11,108
I think you're overestimating
yourself, here.

519
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:14,545
- No, honey,
I'm being 100% literal.

520
00:25:14,547 --> 00:25:16,213
I am not human, Cindy.

521
00:25:16,215 --> 00:25:18,716
And I know it sounds ridiculous,
but it is true.

522
00:25:18,718 --> 00:25:20,217
- Okay...

523
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:22,219
I think that you have
been working too hard...

524
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:23,254
- no, I haven't.

525
00:25:23,256 --> 00:25:26,156
I haven't.

526
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:27,992
I am telling you the truth.

527
00:25:27,994 --> 00:25:29,593
Because you are the one I trust.

528
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:32,696
You are the only one, really.

529
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:36,166
And I really just need
your support right now, babe.

530
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:40,604
- Of course, honey.

531
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:43,607
I apologize.

532
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:46,277
I know that you always find
a way to do the right thing,

533
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:48,145
and I am here for you.

534
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:49,780
Whatever you need.

535
00:25:53,753 --> 00:25:55,286
Now come on.

536
00:25:55,288 --> 00:25:57,054
Let's go home.

537
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:27,217
- It's like a shade orphanage.

538
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:28,319
- We should hurry.

539
00:26:28,321 --> 00:26:29,587
We're running out of time.

540
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:31,221
We should split up.

541
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:33,190
- I kind of have a thing about
splitting up in houses

542
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:34,892
full of creepy kids.

543
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:46,136
Hey, can we ask you a question?

544
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:48,272
- Sure.
- What was that?

545
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:49,840
That you just did
with the money?

546
00:26:49,842 --> 00:26:52,343
- For the little boy?

547
00:26:52,345 --> 00:26:53,677
- What little boy?

548
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,713
- The little boy
with the shitty dad.

549
00:26:55,715 --> 00:26:56,914
He ran away.

550
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:58,649
And now he's cold and hungry.

551
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:00,818
He'll find it on the sidewalk
any minute.

552
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:05,155
- And that...

553
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:06,824
- She's in a hospital room.

554
00:27:06,826 --> 00:27:08,626
She's making them bloom.

555
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:11,362
It's a really obvious miracle,
but that's okay.

556
00:27:11,364 --> 00:27:13,697
The girl in the room
is gonna die anyways.

557
00:27:13,699 --> 00:27:15,633
- So you're all making miracles.

558
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:17,801
- Just little tiny ones, though.

559
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,236
- Cool.

560
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:22,206
Um, we were looking for a shade.

561
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:26,310
- Her name's Julia.
- Yeah, uh, she looks like her.

562
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:28,178
Kind of.
Um, and...

563
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,114
- well, she's a...
- She's a mess.

564
00:27:30,116 --> 00:27:32,383
- We all were when we got here.

565
00:27:32,385 --> 00:27:33,717
Anything else?

566
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:35,819
- Um, she's brave.

567
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:38,355
And funny,
and she probably made friends

568
00:27:38,357 --> 00:27:41,258
with some of the most shy,
maladjusted shades.

569
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,662
She's curious, and she won't
take no for an answer.

570
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:48,666
- Are you looking for
the kind of new one,

571
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:51,168
who's always getting in trouble
and sneaking into

572
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,903
Ms. Persephone's room...
Because, you know,

573
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:54,705
we're never supposed to
go in there.

574
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:58,942
Yeah.
Yeah, that does sound like her.

575
00:27:58,944 --> 00:28:01,679
- I just saw her.
- This way.

576
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:06,350
Up those stairs.

577
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:08,252
Last door.

578
00:28:10,423 --> 00:28:12,423
- Eugene?
- Yeah?

579
00:28:12,425 --> 00:28:14,158
- Who's that?

580
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,459
- That's Ms. Persephone.

581
00:28:15,461 --> 00:28:17,795
She hasn't been here
for a really long time

582
00:28:17,797 --> 00:28:19,329
and no one knows where she is.

583
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:24,034
- Thank you so much
for all your help.

584
00:28:28,773 --> 00:28:31,775
That's our lady underground.

585
00:28:31,777 --> 00:28:33,277
- What?

586
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,245
The one that you...

587
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:45,789
- so you were real
all along, huh?

588
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:48,025
Just completely awol.

589
00:28:48,027 --> 00:28:50,728
Self-centered bitch.

590
00:28:53,466 --> 00:28:57,034
We were so stupid to love you.

591
00:28:57,036 --> 00:28:58,969
<i>- Jules...</i>

592
00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:01,271
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

593
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:05,242
Look, I'm glad I know.

594
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,010
It's always better to know, q.

595
00:29:07,012 --> 00:29:08,912
You keep watch.

596
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,347
I'll sneak in
and find the part of me

597
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:11,949
that already snuck in.

598
00:29:11,951 --> 00:29:13,884
Hmm.

599
00:29:19,324 --> 00:29:21,258
- We're under attack.

600
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,895
The rattening, now reports of
upside down rain.

601
00:29:24,897 --> 00:29:27,865
- Correct... as well as ant hills
turning into volcanoes,

602
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:30,367
the balmy sea turning to acid,

603
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:33,504
and the mysterious disappearance
of all blondes

604
00:29:33,506 --> 00:29:35,472
in the province of
Crickety Cove.

605
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:38,976
- The talking animals report
this includes palomino horses.

606
00:29:38,978 --> 00:29:41,845
Also, every chicken in Fillory
has laryngitis.

607
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:45,082
- Is there a pattern
to any of this?

608
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:46,550
- None that we can tell.

609
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:48,952
Only that whatever it is,
it is increasing.

610
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:51,922
- Idri's turned into a rat,
so it isn't the Lorians.

611
00:29:51,924 --> 00:29:54,391
We've incapacitated
the fu fighters.

612
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:56,059
That leaves...

613
00:29:56,061 --> 00:29:57,995
The people in this room.

614
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:02,566
- Your highness?

615
00:30:02,568 --> 00:30:04,802
- If anyone has anything
to say...

616
00:30:04,804 --> 00:30:06,570
- I'm embezzling funds
from the royal treasury.

617
00:30:06,572 --> 00:30:08,472
- Why did I just say that?
- Hah!

618
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:11,842
Because there's truth serum
in this wine.

619
00:30:11,844 --> 00:30:15,546
I've truthied you.
Anyone else?

620
00:30:15,548 --> 00:30:18,549
- Abigail and I have been using
the castle guards

621
00:30:18,551 --> 00:30:20,017
to run an escort service.

622
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:21,585
- Gross.

623
00:30:21,587 --> 00:30:23,287
But clever.

624
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:25,422
Doesn't help us.

625
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:26,990
Should've made this stronger.

626
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:31,428
- It was me.

627
00:30:37,036 --> 00:30:39,603
I made a deal with the fairies
and I know where fen is.

628
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,979
- You got to be kidding me.

629
00:30:48,981 --> 00:30:50,948
- It's not your break.

630
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:57,354
- So what?
- You, uh... you gonna report me?

631
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:59,857
- Answer a question,
maybe I'll forget to.

632
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,160
- What's your question?

633
00:31:03,162 --> 00:31:04,895
- You trying to fuck that
librarian?

634
00:31:04,897 --> 00:31:05,996
- No!

635
00:31:05,998 --> 00:31:07,865
- I saw you.
- You want to fuck her.

636
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:09,099
You want to
lick her butthole, huh?

637
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:10,634
- Whoa, Jesus, no!

638
00:31:10,636 --> 00:31:12,603
- Then why are you
scamming her so hard

639
00:31:12,605 --> 00:31:15,505
that I nearly blew you?

640
00:31:15,507 --> 00:31:17,140
- I just need her name, okay?

641
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:18,942
- Oh, why didn't you ask?
- Here.

642
00:31:21,913 --> 00:31:24,548
The "s" stands for shot,
or maybe it's schiff.

643
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:26,149
Let me know if you find
anything gross in her book.

644
00:31:26,151 --> 00:31:28,018
I have a feeling she's a total
freak in the sack.

645
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,386
- Okay.

646
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:30,888
What's your deal?

647
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:33,490
- I have no deal.
- You're a child.

648
00:31:33,492 --> 00:31:34,958
- Okay, grandpa,
that's a little...

649
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,463
- what are you even
doing stuck here?

650
00:31:39,465 --> 00:31:41,899
What do they have on you?

651
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:44,668
- Nothing.

652
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46,136
Okay, fine,
they're protecting me.

653
00:31:46,138 --> 00:31:49,072
- Protecting you from what?

654
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:52,042
- My dad is a businessman

655
00:31:52,044 --> 00:31:54,411
and sometimes his competition
can get a little rough,

656
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:55,946
so he sent me here.

657
00:31:55,948 --> 00:31:58,649
- Like, he's a...
- Legitimate businessman.

658
00:31:58,651 --> 00:32:00,384
Can we please not talk about it?

659
00:32:00,386 --> 00:32:02,986
- My god, you're like
that whiny little kid

660
00:32:02,988 --> 00:32:05,389
in "the sopranos," Willow.

661
00:32:05,391 --> 00:32:07,157
- Jesus Christ, you are so lame.

662
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:08,926
Please.

663
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:12,229
And her name was Meadow.

664
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:19,236
- You truthied me?

665
00:32:19,238 --> 00:32:21,171
I can't lie.

666
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:23,573
Eliot, I did this for you.

667
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:26,176
- There was no other way.
- Don't.

668
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:30,614
You started this
when you declared war.

669
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:33,550
Now my wife and child are gone.

670
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:35,118
I need to deal with the rats.

671
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,722
I can't risk having to
clean up your next mess.

672
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:45,162
Guards.

673
00:32:45,164 --> 00:32:47,064
- No, Eliot.

674
00:32:47,066 --> 00:32:50,600
- What are you doing?
- I don't know what else to do.

675
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:54,004
- Take her to the dungeon.
- No!

676
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:56,707
Eliot...

677
00:32:56,709 --> 00:32:58,642
I'll fix this.

678
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:04,047
- Make sure she gets
the best room.

679
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:06,550
And see that she gets
her coconut oil.

680
00:33:06,552 --> 00:33:08,585
Good-bye, Margo.

681
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:19,997
<i>- Oh, shit!</i>

682
00:33:42,588 --> 00:33:45,022
- I know you're in there.

683
00:33:45,024 --> 00:33:46,623
Come out.

684
00:33:46,625 --> 00:33:48,558
It's okay.

685
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,060
It's me.

686
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:56,566
Oh, my god.

687
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:05,242
- Julia, I found her.
- She's...

688
00:34:05,244 --> 00:34:06,543
- Quentin.

689
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:11,248
I missed you so much.

690
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:13,617
- Oh, my god.

691
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:15,185
Hi.

692
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,158
- Are you okay?

693
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,492
- Yeah.
- Are you?

694
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:25,328
- Not really.

695
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:26,696
Without you.

696
00:34:26,698 --> 00:34:29,633
- Did you get Reynard yet?

697
00:34:29,635 --> 00:34:31,668
- I'm trying.

698
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:42,546
- She talks about him
all the time.

699
00:34:42,548 --> 00:34:44,614
Says he's a good guy.

700
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:47,250
Stupid sometimes, but good.

701
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:52,589
- Is there any way
we can take her with us too?

702
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:09,272
- I know you told security
to keep me out,

703
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:11,575
but then I suggested
they let me in.

704
00:35:11,577 --> 00:35:14,277
Stalemate, I guess.

705
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:16,146
Is this about Cowden?

706
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:18,448
I think you just
overwhelmed him a little.

707
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:21,218
I know it's a lot,
but it's worth it.

708
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,320
- My wife.

709
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:25,689
Is anything about our
relationship real?

710
00:35:25,691 --> 00:35:28,792
I've been controlling her
from the day we met, right?

711
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:31,294
- Yes.
- Lucky her.

712
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:33,230
- How is that?

713
00:35:33,232 --> 00:35:34,698
She's a person.

714
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,233
- Yes.

715
00:35:36,235 --> 00:35:37,501
And you're not.

716
00:35:37,503 --> 00:35:39,302
The sooner you wrap
your head around that...

717
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,538
- no, no.

718
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,572
I don't want it.

719
00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:44,741
- You want to be president

720
00:35:44,743 --> 00:35:47,244
of this entire idiotic country.

721
00:35:47,246 --> 00:35:49,412
You have always
sensed your place.

722
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:51,715
- Julia and Kady, they said
you did terrible things.

723
00:35:51,717 --> 00:35:53,617
I should've looked you up
on the spot.

724
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:56,520
- You didn't because I
gently suggested you don't.

725
00:35:56,522 --> 00:35:58,255
It's for your own good, kid.

726
00:35:58,257 --> 00:36:00,223
- So it's all true.

727
00:36:00,225 --> 00:36:01,725
Those poor women.

728
00:36:01,727 --> 00:36:03,593
Those women were hardly victims.

729
00:36:03,595 --> 00:36:05,829
- They said they were just
trying to summon a little help

730
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:07,430
from some kind of goddess...

731
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:10,600
- they were summoning
an evil bitch!

732
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:12,602
You looked me up,
says trickster.

733
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:14,204
See, that's honest.

734
00:36:14,206 --> 00:36:15,505
Yes, I fuck with the weak.

735
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:17,407
You know what that does?
Improves the herd.

736
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:19,843
I help the same little creatures
you want to help.

737
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:21,578
It's not surprising,
you're my son,

738
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,480
how else could it be but her?

739
00:36:23,482 --> 00:36:26,316
The benevolent
"our lady underground."

740
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:27,851
It is all about her.

741
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:31,688
Power, attention, grinding men
and gods into the fucking dirt

742
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,757
and then she leaves!

743
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:47,504
You loved her.

744
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:50,574
- Guess there's some things
you can't control, after all.

745
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,511
- I can see you're upset.

746
00:36:54,513 --> 00:36:56,379
But I need you
to move past that.

747
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:58,748
Stop worrying about humans.

748
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,650
They're beneath you.

749
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:03,553
This is your birthright, son.

750
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,388
We're gonna do so much together.

751
00:37:09,428 --> 00:37:11,361
- How'd you do it?
- You know, turn me back?

752
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:13,296
- A special Fillorian mint.

753
00:37:13,298 --> 00:37:15,632
And about 50 straight minutes
of casting,

754
00:37:15,634 --> 00:37:18,768
so I'm gonna need a minute
to recharge.

755
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:21,671
You sure you don't want
any clothes, or...

756
00:37:21,673 --> 00:37:23,440
- Eh.

757
00:37:23,442 --> 00:37:24,574
Can't you get Margo to help?

758
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,276
You know, give you a break?

759
00:37:26,278 --> 00:37:27,811
- I kind of threw her
in the dungeon.

760
00:37:27,813 --> 00:37:29,479
- Got ya.

761
00:37:29,481 --> 00:37:31,448
Well, you'll run yourself dead,

762
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:32,582
doing everything on your own.

763
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:34,284
- Believe me, I know.

764
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:36,786
- Pass some shit down the chain
to the governors

765
00:37:36,788 --> 00:37:41,658
or the Dukes or whatever.

766
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:44,294
You don't have any governors?

767
00:37:44,296 --> 00:37:45,762
No Dukes?

768
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:49,366
- Get you some delegates, son.
- Right, really good idea.

769
00:37:49,368 --> 00:37:51,768
Select governors.

770
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,737
Yet another task
for the high king.

771
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:56,473
- Or you just hold an election.

772
00:37:56,475 --> 00:38:00,577
Let the people pick their own,
you do<i> nada.</i>

773
00:38:00,579 --> 00:38:01,878
- That's...
- Stupid, is it stupid?

774
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,747
- I'm sorry.
- Brilliant, Josh.

775
00:38:03,749 --> 00:38:06,683
I think you just invented
democracy,

776
00:38:06,685 --> 00:38:08,585
and it's going to save Fillory.

777
00:38:08,587 --> 00:38:10,887
- Well, high five, brother.

778
00:38:15,661 --> 00:38:18,828
- Eliot?
- What the hell?

779
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:23,900
- Dude, I thought you were
off being, like,

780
00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:26,403
the high king of Fillory?

781
00:38:26,405 --> 00:38:28,538
- I am.

782
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:31,441
I was.

783
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:33,543
I think I just got kicked out.

784
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:45,555
<i>- Of course her book
is relocated</i>

785
00:38:45,557 --> 00:38:47,857
to the poison room.

786
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:49,359
- Okay.

787
00:38:49,361 --> 00:38:51,061
So what's our next move?

788
00:38:51,063 --> 00:38:52,529
- Admit I'm fucking cursed?

789
00:38:52,531 --> 00:38:53,530
<i>- Is this all you guys do?</i>

790
00:38:53,532 --> 00:38:55,065
Talk about your fee-fees?

791
00:38:55,067 --> 00:38:57,434
I was kind of hoping
you'd get to fucking.

792
00:38:57,436 --> 00:38:59,069
- How did you...

793
00:38:59,071 --> 00:39:01,805
- oh, hopped into your mind
when you hopped into hers.

794
00:39:01,807 --> 00:39:03,373
It's a little trick
my dad's friends taught me.

795
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:06,409
- Your dad's friends
are perverts?

796
00:39:06,411 --> 00:39:07,944
- Thugs.
- Magic mobsters.

797
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:09,012
- No, they're not.
- Jesus.

798
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:10,413
- Which is why I'm leaving.

799
00:39:10,415 --> 00:39:12,415
- So's Willow.
- Meadow, doofus.

800
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:13,583
Fine, kick me out.

801
00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:15,085
You really don't need my help.

802
00:39:15,087 --> 00:39:16,553
- Help with what?

803
00:39:16,555 --> 00:39:19,356
- Trying to break into
the poison room.

804
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:21,524
I've been in your crappy Nolan
movie for, like, 20 minutes.

805
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,393
I heard everything.

806
00:39:23,395 --> 00:39:24,661
Been trying to get in there
myself, 'cause, you know,

807
00:39:24,663 --> 00:39:26,463
I'm curious about a few things.

808
00:39:26,465 --> 00:39:28,431
So you can either start from
square one on your own,

809
00:39:28,433 --> 00:39:31,534
or you can hop the line
and join...

810
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:34,938
- Well, the pervy mob girl
has a point.

811
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,040
- No.
- It's dangerous.

812
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:39,843
- You know what's safe?
- Nothing.

813
00:39:39,845 --> 00:39:41,144
You're not responsible
for me, okay?

814
00:39:41,146 --> 00:39:44,647
Free will, I exercise that shit.

815
00:39:44,649 --> 00:39:45,882
- I'm gonna hate this.

816
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,450
- You hate everything.

817
00:39:47,452 --> 00:39:49,519
That's why I like you.

818
00:39:49,521 --> 00:39:52,155
<i>- Kady.
- Kady!</i>

819
00:39:52,157 --> 00:39:54,057
<i>Kady, wake up.</i>

820
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,862
- Kady.
- Hey.

821
00:39:58,864 --> 00:40:02,031
- What?
- Hey, you, uh, you got a guest.

822
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:05,502
Professor Lipson told me
to bring him here.

823
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:12,475
- If you're still after Reynard,

824
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:14,511
I want in.

825
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:20,183
- Eliot?

826
00:40:22,654 --> 00:40:24,421
Oh, you.

827
00:40:24,423 --> 00:40:27,090
- I shouldn't be here, but...

828
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,061
Please.
Your majesty.

829
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:34,597
- Be careful.
- So not a nice scotch, then?

830
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:38,701
- It will transport you
to the fairy realm.

831
00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:42,172
I must warn you, few return.

832
00:40:42,174 --> 00:40:45,508
But it is a chance to save fen,

833
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:47,911
the baby.

834
00:40:47,913 --> 00:40:49,579
I would go, but...

835
00:40:49,581 --> 00:40:52,015
- you're a pussy who's in love
with a sloth,

836
00:40:52,017 --> 00:40:54,451
who's currently a rat.

837
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:58,188
And end of the day,
it's my mess to clean up.

838
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,457
Tell Eliot that.

839
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:12,035
<i>- Q, it's time.</i>

840
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:16,206
- This is it.

841
00:41:16,208 --> 00:41:17,774
It's who I couldn't make
the math work.

842
00:41:17,776 --> 00:41:19,108
- What math?

843
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,977
- Uh, the spell
to bring Alice back.

844
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:23,012
I knew something was missing,
I just didn't know...

845
00:41:23,014 --> 00:41:27,050
- It was me.

846
00:41:27,052 --> 00:41:28,685
You have to go now.

847
00:41:28,687 --> 00:41:30,687
There's a portal in there,

848
00:41:30,689 --> 00:41:32,755
back to reception.

849
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:34,991
And I'm glad we got to
say good-bye.

850
00:41:38,562 --> 00:41:41,231
Um, I'm gonna be back here
for good one day,

851
00:41:41,233 --> 00:41:44,634
and I am going to find you.

852
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:50,139
Okay.

853
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,817
- You first.

854
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:23,706
- Jules, what the hell?
- This isn't up for debate.

855
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,141
- We came here
so that you could...

856
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:27,143
- yeah?
- So?

857
00:42:27,145 --> 00:42:29,145
Things change.

858
00:42:29,147 --> 00:42:30,713
- If you do this...
- I know.

859
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:32,749
This is my one shot.

860
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:34,584
And this is what
I want to do with it.

861
00:42:34,586 --> 00:42:36,553
- I found them!
- Stop!

862
00:42:36,555 --> 00:42:37,787
- Come on,
or we'll lose her, too.

863
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:39,122
<i>- You can't take that shade!</i>

864
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:43,626
- It's all going to be okay,
Quentin.
