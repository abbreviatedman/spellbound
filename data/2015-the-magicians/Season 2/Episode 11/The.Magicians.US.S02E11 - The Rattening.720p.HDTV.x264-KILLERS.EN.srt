- Julia!

366
00:17:19,686 --> 00:17:21,717

- Oh, welcome!

367
00:17:21,842 --> 00:17:23,342

There's every ecosystem.

386
00:18:07,335 --> 00:18:09,444
Nearest we can tell,

387

389
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:13,591
Fuck yeah.

390
00:18:13,616 --> 00:18:14,666

391
00:18:14,735 --> 00:18:17,035

helps us settle in

392
00:18:17,104 --> 00:18:18,637

393
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,639

Whoo!

394
00:18:20,991 --> 00:18:23,163

- Yeah. Gods.

395
00:18:23,264 --> 00:18:24,858
We were right about
them being real.

396
00:18:24,928 --> 00:18:26,530
Hades created the Underworld,

397
00:18:26,663 --> 00:18:28,155

Persephone.

398
00:18:28,202 --> 00:18:30,663
They live in a big house
way over here.

399
00:18:30,827 --> 00:18:33,155
It's a beautiful area
called Elysium.

400
00:18:33,311 --> 00:18:35,428
Apparently, they used to
come and go like clockwork

401
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:38,045
every fall and spring,
but a while back,

402
00:18:38,131 --> 00:18:39,436
they just disappeared.

403
00:18:39,499 --> 00:18:41,608
Wait, why are you
doing all this, Richard?

404
00:18:42,647 --> 00:18:44,696
I know you.
This is a project.

405
00:18:45,069 --> 00:18:46,631
I'm trying to find my son.

406
00:18:46,944 --> 00:18:49,301
I don't know where he is,
if he's even still here.

407
00:18:49,514 --> 00:18:51,014
But he's got to be somewhere.

408
00:18:51,194 --> 00:18:53,772
And they won't tell me
a damn thing.

409
00:18:54,045 --> 00:18:55,874
Why not?

410
00:18:56,178 --> 00:18:59,211
I'm flagged as culpable
in his death.

411
00:18:59,522 --> 00:19:00,842
There are rules.

412
00:19:01,022 --> 00:19:03,272
And friends to help me
break them.

413
00:19:05,217 --> 00:19:07,233

do they keep the Shades?

414

Sorry, we don't know that yet.

415
00:19:09,053 --> 00:19:10,115
So we're flying blind?

416
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,452
Hun, you're gonna have to bowl.

417
00:19:12,506 --> 00:19:14,561
No, look, I had an incident
when I was a kid.

418
00:19:14,624 --> 00:19:16,280

- Oh, get over it.

Your girl would.

420

- She's not my girl.
- No shit.

421

She's tough as granite.

422
00:19:21,499 --> 00:19:23,335
And you're afraid to bowl.

423
00:19:23,404 --> 00:19:24,436
Fine.

424
00:19:29,907 --> 00:19:33,245

eats you and Quentin?
