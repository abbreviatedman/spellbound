00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,766
I need to know where your
Dicranium Scoparium Majorus grows.

181
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,234
Are you having a seizure?

182
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,339
Moss? Why?

183
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:41,430
Fix my hands.

184
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:42,618
You got a royal
botanist or something?

185
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,611
Oh, well, um, we did,

186
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:47,169
but apparently he sort
of got eaten on the job.

187
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:49,506
By what? A plant? (CHUCKLING)

188
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:52,985
(SIGHS)

189
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,517
I hate this place.

190
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,247
Try the royal map-maker.

191
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:02,660
Love ya.

192
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:05,460
So she's only shown
herself to me that I know of.

193
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,200
I don't know.

194
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:10,669
Maybe I'm tuned into her
ghost channel or something, or...

195
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:14,385
Maybe it has something
to do with this. I don't know.

196
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,169
I believe you.

197
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,335
You do?

198
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,538
I know my daughter.
She's trying to protect us.

199
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:24,516
Seeing her like that would be very
upsetting for her mother and me,

200
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,279
but she led you
to this for a reason.

201
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,185
Alice called a
couple of months ago

202
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:32,919
about some ghost children
trapped in an estate in England.

203
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:35,461
The Plover Estate.
Yes, yes, that's the one.

204
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,463
I was delighted to
help. Got a hold of this,

205
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,524
planned to give it to her when
she had the time to visit, but then...

206
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:49,005
Well, anyway, you
see, the ancients had

207
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:53,536
many ways of dealing with
ghosts out of necessity back then.

208
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:56,515
Alice's Ka, her soul,

209
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,085
is not at rest, but it can be.

210
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:03,856
Now, one ancient
civilization that really mastered

211
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:07,291
the whole getting-one's-
soul-to-rest thing...

212
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,828
The Egyptians.

213
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:12,823
Wait, are you saying that
Alice wants us to build...

214
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,395
Ecce.

215
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,038
In pyramis.

216
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:22,669
ELIOT: Oh, my God.

217
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,869
What's going on?

218
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:26,276
Just another day in the office?

219
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:29,948
(FANFARE PLAYING)

220
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:35,087
PICKWICK: Your Majesties,
the much-venerated emissaries

221
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:36,554
of our neighbors to the north.

222
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:39,855
I present Prince Ess of Loria.

223
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:43,552
ELIOT: I'm sorry...

224
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:46,090
Princess?

225
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,264
Please, call me Ess.

226
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:50,431
Prince Ess.

227
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:53,632
(CHUCKLES) Oh, my God.
Fuck your parents, dude.

228
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:55,266
ESS: We've got a problem.

229
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,486
You guys have been fucking
shit up for over half a century.

230
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,569
Okay.

231
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:00,222
This is how Lorians
talk? ESS: And look...

232
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:01,690
(WHISPERING) The
Prince speaks fluent Earth.

233
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:05,617
Rumor has it his mother
is from, uh... Cincinn-ah-ti.

234
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:06,744
Oh...

235
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,811
until The Beast
drained the Wellspring.

236
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:11,153
And then, oh, yeah...

237
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:14,453
You jokers let Ember take
a dump... Get to your point.

238
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:17,994
Loria depends on the
Wellspring's tributaries,

239
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:19,929
but now their magic's
jacked. Not enough.

240
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,761
Crops, rivers, entire
species are affected.

241
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:24,827
You dicked us over. No.

242
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,839
We're trying to fix it, so...

243
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,670
Great, then this should be easy.

244
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:31,506
I'm here to propose a treaty
between our two kingdoms.

245
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:34,240
A 50-50 split of the Wellspring.

246
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,891
(COURTIERS MURMURING)
And to seal the alliance,

247
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:39,545
I, Crown Prince of Loria,
offer my hand in marriage

248
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:41,721
to the Virgin Queen Margo.

249
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:47,020
Um... (SNICKERING) Okay.

250
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:50,086

virgin? Bambi, please, let me.

(CLEARS THROAT)

252
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,465
Ess, thank you.

253
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:56,025
We will consider
your generous offer.

254
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:57,195
No, we will not.

255
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,465
Margo, please.

256
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,903
Listen, Prince Ess,
I'm not a sharer,

257
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:05,745
so why don't you walk
yourself and your un-ironic furs

258
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:07,178
out of my castle?

259
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:10,148
All right then.

I'll make it worth your
while if you just show me

266
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,364
where the goddamn moss grows.

267
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:27,764
I told you,

268
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:29,735
I'll draw your
map for you next...

isn't a single accurate map

around to my offer.

anything if I were you.

who can... What?

No, you're not leaving me in a
castle full of barbarian frat bros.

00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:01,586
Okay, fine, but while
we're talking about them,

297
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:03,105
you could've been
a little diplomatic.

298
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,894
By agreeing to marry a
complete stranger on the spot?

299
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,092
I did it.

300
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:08,995
That was different.

301
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:12,037
(SCOFFS) You're right, this
would only really be equivalent

302

if Ess was a girl, and you
found pussy, you know,

303

interesting in a "sometimes
you like Thai food" kind of way,

304
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:21,439
and now it's all Thai
food forever till you die.

00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,779
No, he's a man,

306
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,944
who seems arrogant and entitled

307

and unclear on the
concept of consent.

308

I can't imagine what
could possibly go wrong.

00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,289
Look, I'm not
saying do it. It's just...

You're a queen. I'm a king.

We don't necessarily
marry for love.

312
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,093
It's part of the job.

313
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,270
Fine, I'll talk to him,

314
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:47,671

out of this epic clusterfuck.

Yeah, except blood. Human blood.

And if that's what it is,

324
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:30,046
it's the DNA of whoever cast
the banishing, so let's hope, right?

325
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:31,209
Yeah.

326
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,701
How long does it take?

327
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:53,330
It should work right away.

328
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,533
It's been decades.

329
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:57,042
I mean, whoever did the
banishing could be dead by now.

330
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:59,168

Let's not bring
Stephanie into this just yet.

uh, you go up, hang the mirror.

00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:27,333
First, uh, memorize this.

357
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,993
Recite it when you're up there.

358
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:30,730
This looks like
Arabic, but not...

359
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:32,635
Yes, Egyptian Arabic.

360
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,640
Huh? Okay... (STAMMERING)

361
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:37,108
Well, my Egyptian
Arabic is a little rusty.

362
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,369
No, you'll be fine.
Just whatever you do,

363
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:42,438
don't let the mirror shatter.
I've already enchanted it.

364
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:43,615
Now...

365
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,810
We've only got one shot.

366
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:48,764
Well, then Daniel, I
think that you should do it.

367
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:51,849
You do it. No. I mean,
if it's that important...

368
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,722
No, Quentin, please. Just you.

369
00:19:58,631 --> 00:19:59,655
Yeah.

370
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:03,629
Give me a minute with this.

371
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,249
Oh, my God.

372
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:24,015
There you are.

373
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:53,408
Who are you? (GASPS)

374
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:54,918
Why did you follow me?

375
00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:58,180
Hi.

376
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:01,285
My name is Julia.
I need your help.

377
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,860
It's Reynard. He's back.

378
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,501
How?

379
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,704
Look, it's a long
story. It was a mistake.

380
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:17,934
He hurt you too, didn't
he? Okay, I'm sorry.

381
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,774
I'm... I cannot help you.

382
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,005
What? Wait, I am pregnant.

383
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:29,213
He... Don't worry,

384
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:31,551
the thing will never be born.

385
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,558
I don't care if I have
to jump off a building.

386
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,788
But I cannot let him do
this to another woman.

387
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:37,523
You banished him once.

388
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:39,929
All I am asking is for you
to teach me how to do it.

389
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,339
I think you better come inside.

390
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:06,457
Oh! Shit.

391
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,592
(PANTING)

392
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:19,366
Well... Alanis Morissette.

393
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,275
Alice loved that cat.

394
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,342
Okay, but why...

395
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,641
I've always had a
terrible fear of heights.

396
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:29,011
One day, Alanis Morissette
got stuck on the roof.

397
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:31,209
Alice begged me to get
her down, but I couldn't,

398
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:34,219
and honestly, I yelled at her,

399
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:36,531
because sometimes that is what
one does when one is ashamed.

400
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:38,183
And the cat...

401
00:22:39,258 --> 00:22:41,420
It did not end well.

402
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,994
I don't know if Alice
ever forgave me

403
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:49,497
for not being brave enough.

404
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,302
Maybe she will now.

405
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,104
No, Daniel, you don't have
to do that. Look, I can do it.

406
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,240
No, I can do it.

407
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,306
For Alice.

408
00:23:03,449 --> 00:23:05,042

00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:10,255

Whoa, whoa! Ow.

414
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:21,961
Daniel.

415
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:26,936
(MEN LAUGHING) Yeah, right?

416
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:28,167
And then they came across.

417
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,367
MARGO: Hey.

418
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:33,807
Are you kidding me?

(SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE)

420
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:43,321
So...

421
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:45,623
When's the wedding?

422
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:48,387
If we forgo the marriage,

423
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:52,286
I'm willing to grant you periodic
access to the Wellspring...

424
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,560
You think this is a negotiation?

425
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,465
No marriage, no treaty...

426
00:23:58,237 --> 00:23:59,364
No castle back.

427
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,474
Okay, Conan,

428
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:05,042
let me explain to you how
marriage works where I come from.

429
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,942
Oh, spare me. I know.

430
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,305
My mother shipped me
off to Exeter when I was 16.

431
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:10,405
You?

432
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:13,011
Fancy New England
boarding school?

433
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:14,819
Had a dorm full
of future senators

convinced I was an
exchange student from Iceland.

435
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:18,614
Point is, I get it.

436
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,744
I'm shockingly progressive
for a Lorian. (SCOFFS)

437
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,729
We get married, I'd still
let you speak in public.

438
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,640
I'd make sure that you...
Jesus, I'm not marrying you.

439
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:27,030
You think I wanna
marry a virgin?

440
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:29,068
This is purely
political. Oh, my God.

441
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:30,831
I'm not a virgin.

442
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:35,641
Look, I've had
the best in Loria,

443
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,509
and Lorians are the best.

444
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:41,244
Hmm. So either way,

445
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:43,075
you're a virgin to
me, sweetheart.

446
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,242
I'm not your sweetheart,

447
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:51,948
and I'm certain that
I can bang circles

448
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:54,994
around your boring
little Lorian hoes,

449
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,720
'cause I'm a very smart,

very liberated woman,

451
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,930
and when I set my
mind to something,

452
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:06,933
I master it.

453
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:10,633
And you've mastered what?

454
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,978
Never touching a man?

455
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:16,941
Not touching, touching...

456
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:20,443
I'm good at both.

Say it, or I'll stop.

459

Don't stop.

460

Beg me.

461
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:36,901
I like you.

ELIOT: So you waited until now
to tell me about you and Bayler?

463
00:25:42,408 --> 00:25:43,551
I've been trying to tell you.

464
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:44,753
It's been a little insane today.

465
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:46,421
I'm not trying to keep secrets
from you. That's my point.

466
00:25:46,445 --> 00:25:49,472
Eliot, please understand.

467
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:51,774
I had a life before you came.

468
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,376
I had no idea if you
even would come.

469
00:25:54,787 --> 00:25:57,586
Fillory is my home,
and I care about it.

470
00:25:58,524 --> 00:25:59,924
So you became a terrorist?

471
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:01,290
(SIGHS) We're not violent.

472
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:04,192
I'd call your ex-boyfriend
trying to strangle me

473
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:05,492
a little bit violent!

00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:06,725
He's not my...

475
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:09,533
We were close, yes,

476
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:12,264
but hurting people
was never the plan.

477
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:15,068
I have no idea who
you are. I'm your wife.

478
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,217
Because your father made you.

479
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,401
I could've walked out of here

480
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:18,741
a long time ago.

481
00:26:18,811 --> 00:26:20,040
Then why didn't you?

482
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:22,545
If you hate us so much,
if you hate me so much,

483
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:24,310
why didn't you? Because I don't.

484
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:26,477
I believe in you.
You think I stayed

485
00:26:26,552 --> 00:26:29,613
because you're just so
deeply attracted to me?

wants you to succeed.

I want us to.

(SIGHS) So what
am I supposed to do

489
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:42,634
with your good friend
in the dungeon, huh?

490
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:43,741
You should keep him there.

491
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:45,236
I don't think you can trust him.

492
00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:46,897
Do you think I can trust you?

DANA: I was 21.

494
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,339
It didn't seem so
crazy back then to think

495
00:26:57,416 --> 00:27:00,511
I could summon the
goddess, do good.

496
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:02,521
Yeah, that's what I wanted too.

497
00:27:02,588 --> 00:27:04,921
I couldn't get rid
of the baby either.

What?

499
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:09,252
I wasn't the only one
he raped that night,

500

but I was the only
one who got pregnant.

501
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:13,627

502
00:27:13,699 --> 00:27:15,497
I tried everything.

00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:18,002
I even thought
about killing myself,

through with it.

Okay, I got it. I'll find you.

tell anyone you saw this...

Ooh, oh, no, no, no.
No, I'd never. I, uh...

both of your legs

I'm too crazy right now.

I don't know what you
want from me, okay?

572
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:06,156
Okay. I want you to start
by understanding something,

573
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:08,591
and I don't expect you
to like the idea of this,

574

to have that baby.

but that little demigod
growing inside of you

579
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:22,073
is like a tiny nuclear reactor.

580
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:27,044
You have one chance to harness
that power when you give birth.

581
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:28,410
Then I don't want that power.

582
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,675
Yes, you do,

583
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:31,683
because that's how
I banished Reynard,

584
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,446

585

586
00:32:35,821 --> 00:32:37,084

(REYNARD LAUGHS)
(GASPS) Oh, God.

712
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:37,868
Too slow. Sorry.

713
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:42,405
(SNIFFS DEEPLY)
Dana. In the flesh.

714
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:44,070
I'd heard you were dead.

715
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:46,270
You hid well. I'm impressed.

716
00:40:46,344 --> 00:40:49,109
What happened? You slipped up.

717
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,180
(GASPS)

718
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:56,120
I think you have
some apologizing to do.

719
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,817
Don't you?

720
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,829
I have reached my decision.

721
00:41:11,903 --> 00:41:16,398
I will marry the Prince
of Loria, on one condition.

722
00:41:16,741 --> 00:41:20,371
I want a tour of his
kingdom right now.

723
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,748
Wedding first, then a tour.

724
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:34,959
Last tree, and done.

725
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,256
Oh, no.

726
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:43,835
No, no, no.

727
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:46,600
This is the worst
day of my life.

728
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:49,363
I know, right?
Crazy illusion magic.

729
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:51,835
So, hey, what do you
think about making that...

730
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:55,640
Map.

731
00:41:57,048 --> 00:41:58,209
You drew it for me.

732
00:41:58,282 --> 00:41:59,375
Yes.

733
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,009
I made an exception.

734
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:04,755
Thank you.

735
00:42:07,592 --> 00:42:09,151
You're still bat
shit crazy, man.

736
00:42:09,227 --> 00:42:10,388
I heard that.

737
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:13,687
Margo, please.

738
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,765
You fucked with us.

739
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:17,131
Mmm-hmm. Yes, you did.

740
00:42:17,402 --> 00:42:18,836
You fucked with our castle.

741
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:20,269
Amen, sister.

742
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:22,534
And now we're gonna
put our Jimmy Choos

743
00:42:22,607 --> 00:42:25,941
so far up your ass, you're
gonna taste next season.

744
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:28,639
Exactly, whatever that means.

745
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:34,512
Because the High King and I hereby
declare war on the Kingdom of Loria!

746
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:35,813
Yes!

747
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:38,387
Wait...

748
00:42:40,425 --> 00:42:41,586
Really?
