1
00:00:01,058 --> 00:00:03,178
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:04,915
Alice, whose house is this exactly?

3
00:00:05,035 --> 00:00:07,569
- Alice?
- Hi, Dad.

4
00:00:07,604 --> 00:00:10,972
- You know how I feel about Mom.
- Fine. Stephanie.

5
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,552
Ugh, I just feel like
I'm being pulled back

6
00:00:12,576 --> 00:00:15,110
into this version of me
when I was, like, 12

7
00:00:15,145 --> 00:00:17,546
and furious and invisible and mute.

8
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:19,147
You cure your own hands just fine,

9
00:00:19,183 --> 00:00:21,149
but mine, you can't do
a fucking thing about, huh?

10
00:00:21,185 --> 00:00:22,984
There are other options.

11
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,454
You can travel to Fillory.

12
00:00:25,489 --> 00:00:28,156
Go there, get this.

13
00:00:28,192 --> 00:00:29,524
I'll do what I can.

14
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,494
You may address me as Reynard the Fox.

15
00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:34,329
Reynard is targeting hedges.

16
00:00:34,364 --> 00:00:36,298
There was a girl. Forty years ago,

17
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:39,034
she banished Reynard from Earth.

18
00:00:39,069 --> 00:00:41,870
I still don't know what I'm looking for.

19
00:00:41,905 --> 00:00:45,941
Any sort of strange event or aberration.

20
00:00:47,578 --> 00:00:50,278
- The test was positive.
- Fuck!

21
00:00:50,314 --> 00:00:51,513
Yeah, so let's just get

22
00:00:51,548 --> 00:00:53,648
this pesky abortion out of the way.

23
00:00:53,684 --> 00:00:54,684
Kady!

24
00:00:56,653 --> 00:01:00,055
I'm Bayler, a proud soldier
of Fillorians United.

25
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,456
I'm not a Fu Fighter anymore.

26
00:01:01,492 --> 00:01:03,391
Help us, or I go to your king,

27
00:01:03,427 --> 00:01:06,128
and tell him exactly
how well I know his wife.

28
00:01:06,163 --> 00:01:07,763
Then I'll tell him myself.

29
00:01:07,798 --> 00:01:09,231
What is she doing?

30
00:01:09,266 --> 00:01:10,932
She can't. She'll niffin out.

31
00:01:14,004 --> 00:01:16,171
Your turn.

32
00:01:16,206 --> 00:01:18,940
- Quentin says go free.
- Alice!

33
00:01:44,968 --> 00:01:48,904
Um...

34
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:51,239
Remind me again
what summoning Alice's niffin

35
00:01:51,275 --> 00:01:53,875
has to do with the...

36
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:56,845
tai chi... I mean, ballet.

37
00:02:00,017 --> 00:02:01,950
Ooh.

38
00:02:01,985 --> 00:02:04,052
God, he should never do that move again.

39
00:02:04,087 --> 00:02:06,555
It's niffin bait.
You have to call to them

40
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,256
at their point of their transformation

41
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:09,491
with something personal.

42
00:02:09,526 --> 00:02:11,793
Oh... It's a sex thing.

43
00:02:11,829 --> 00:02:14,796
No, it's Cirque Du Soleil.
You know Cirque Du Soleil?

44
00:02:14,832 --> 00:02:17,032
You and Alice had sex
to Cirque Du Soleil?

45
00:02:17,067 --> 00:02:18,907
No, it was something
I would do to cheer her up

46
00:02:18,936 --> 00:02:20,702
when she was sad. It made her laugh.

47
00:02:20,737 --> 00:02:22,237
Ugh.

48
00:02:22,272 --> 00:02:23,872
That just made my heart hurt a little.

49
00:02:23,907 --> 00:02:26,908
- Shut up.
- I was being sincere.

50
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,143
Does he have the box?

51
00:02:28,178 --> 00:02:29,811
I mean, what if this actually works?

52
00:02:29,847 --> 00:02:33,548
Yes, but be warned, he wants
to try to reason with her.

53
00:02:33,584 --> 00:02:35,884
She was working on
some sort of reversal spell.

54
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:38,386
He thinks he can somehow finish it.

55
00:02:38,422 --> 00:02:40,822
He's convinced she wants him to.

56
00:02:40,858 --> 00:02:41,890
Oh, Jesus.

57
00:02:41,925 --> 00:02:44,326
Okay, I'm starting over.

58
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:45,894
No, Q, stop.

59
00:02:45,929 --> 00:02:49,397
If Alice was still a niffin...
if she was still here...

60
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:51,533
You've been at this an hour.

61
00:02:51,568 --> 00:02:55,537
You can't summon her,
because she's gone.

62
00:02:55,572 --> 00:02:58,073
It's just I saw her... it felt so real.

63
00:02:58,108 --> 00:03:00,342
Why don't we get you
back to the castle, huh?

64
00:03:00,377 --> 00:03:02,644
Some rest, some food.

65
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:05,213
And hey, there's an entire
kingdom's-worth

66
00:03:05,249 --> 00:03:07,983
of problems to distract you.

67
00:03:08,018 --> 00:03:11,686
We really are beset,
and could use your help.

68
00:03:11,722 --> 00:03:14,389
- I hear you, I'm just...
- Good, vamanos.

69
00:03:14,424 --> 00:03:16,791
Her memorial is tomorrow.

70
00:03:16,827 --> 00:03:19,594
I should go and look
her parents in the eye...

71
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,365
tell them how she died.

72
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,501
And then...

73
00:03:26,536 --> 00:03:28,169
I'll come back to Fillory,

74
00:03:28,205 --> 00:03:31,606
and I'll be a king. I promise.

75
00:03:31,642 --> 00:03:33,808
Can I trust you with this?
No offense, Q,

76
00:03:33,844 --> 00:03:36,144
you're a little crazy right now.

77
00:03:36,179 --> 00:03:38,647
Maybe, but yeah.

78
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:07,442
Ah, the sacrifice.

79
00:04:07,477 --> 00:04:09,377
Uh, the plinth is in the backyard.

80
00:04:09,413 --> 00:04:11,846
Follow me. Just, uh, watch the rug.

81
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:16,117
Daniel...

82
00:04:16,153 --> 00:04:19,321
reconfigured the entire house,
and still...

83
00:04:19,356 --> 00:04:24,726
everywhere I look, I see
something that Alice touched.

84
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:27,662
My children loved me.

85
00:04:27,698 --> 00:04:31,032
- I was a good mother.
- You were, Stephanie, you were.

86
00:04:31,068 --> 00:04:33,668
- So much better than my mother.
- Of cour...

87
00:04:33,704 --> 00:04:35,837
What have I done to deserve this?

88
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,154
Um, hi.

89
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,527
Alice?

90
00:05:01,298 --> 00:05:05,533
Alice...

91
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:07,168
Are you really there?

92
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,377
Okay.

93
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,525
You're kind of freaking me out.

94
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,428
I mean, I love you, but you're
very ghost-like right now, so...

95
00:05:37,134 --> 00:05:39,467
Okay.

96
00:05:43,306 --> 00:05:45,440
I can't.

97
00:05:49,513 --> 00:05:51,513
Okay.

98
00:05:51,548 --> 00:05:55,383
Okay, okay...

99
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,954
No.

100
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:03,691
Eliot and Margo are right. You're...

101
00:06:03,727 --> 00:06:06,895
she's gone, and you're a little crazy.

102
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,386
Or not.

103
00:06:55,712 --> 00:06:57,745
Alice.

104
00:07:11,328 --> 00:07:13,628
Just don't jump out at me, okay?

105
00:07:26,343 --> 00:07:28,409
Quentin?

106
00:07:28,445 --> 00:07:29,744
Is that you?

107
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:32,580
Uh, sorry, Mr. Q... or Daniel. Sorry.

108
00:07:32,615 --> 00:07:33,948
Give me a hug.

109
00:07:39,055 --> 00:07:42,023
How on earth did you get into
my private study?

110
00:07:42,058 --> 00:07:44,258
Uh...

111
00:07:44,294 --> 00:07:46,394
There's, um, something going on.

112
00:07:52,369 --> 00:07:54,469
Yeah.

113
00:07:54,504 --> 00:07:55,837
Yeah, got it.

114
00:07:55,872 --> 00:07:56,882
Tell them I'm Hannah's daughter,

115
00:07:56,906 --> 00:08:00,007
and this is an emergency.

116
00:08:00,043 --> 00:08:04,345
Can you just tell her
to call me, please?

117
00:08:04,381 --> 00:08:06,314
- Hey.
- Hey.

118
00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:09,317
Uh, I mixed up your dose.
It's on the counter.

119
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,724
To all the heroine I am not taking.

120
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,059
Cheers.

121
00:08:20,063 --> 00:08:21,729
- Mm.
- Did you get the pickles?

122
00:08:21,765 --> 00:08:22,864
Yep.

123
00:08:28,004 --> 00:08:31,572
You found something.

124
00:08:31,608 --> 00:08:34,409
August 19th, 1976, 7:00 a.m.

125
00:08:34,444 --> 00:08:35,988
An unseasonal hailstorm
hit the Northeast.

126
00:08:36,012 --> 00:08:37,345
Nothing too crazy, right?

127
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,548
An hour later,
a tidal wave slammed into Miami.

128
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,617
Hour after that, hurricanes
struck both the coasts

129
00:08:42,652 --> 00:08:44,218
of Peru, Chile.

130
00:08:44,254 --> 00:08:46,487
I mean, something rippled down
the entire hemisphere,

131
00:08:46,523 --> 00:08:51,526
and if you follow the chain
reaction back to its source...

132
00:08:51,561 --> 00:08:54,095
Hoboken, New Jersey?

133
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,063
Nothing ever starts
in Hoboken, New Jersey.

134
00:08:56,099 --> 00:08:59,434
Well, on August 19th,
some time before dawn,

135
00:08:59,469 --> 00:09:01,102
this happened.

136
00:09:01,137 --> 00:09:03,104
Industrial park burned to the ground.

137
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:04,972
No one could explain
what caused the fire,

138
00:09:05,008 --> 00:09:08,676
or why it left one single
building standing untouched

139
00:09:08,711 --> 00:09:11,612
with a perfect circle of burn around it.

140
00:09:16,419 --> 00:09:17,685
Thank you.

141
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,821
Mm. Mm-hmm.

142
00:09:19,856 --> 00:09:20,988
Next.

143
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,438
- Eliot, I need to talk to you.
- Oh, thank you.

144
00:09:25,462 --> 00:09:29,063
It's about that Fu Fighter
in the dungeon.

145
00:09:29,098 --> 00:09:32,300
What the actual
all-encompassing fuck is this?

146
00:09:32,335 --> 00:09:34,168
Your majesty, you said you wanted

147
00:09:34,204 --> 00:09:37,038
- a unicorn milk latte.
- I was joking.

148
00:09:37,073 --> 00:09:38,973
Wait, you milked a unicorn?

149
00:09:41,044 --> 00:09:44,879
So listen, about Bayler...

150
00:09:44,914 --> 00:09:48,691
Holy shit,
the walking plot twist returns.

151
00:09:48,726 --> 00:09:50,860
- Hi, I need something.
- Shocker.

152
00:09:50,895 --> 00:09:53,930
Hey, Fen, look who it is. Uncy Penny.

153
00:09:53,965 --> 00:09:56,899
That's right, I knocked her up.
No big deal.

154
00:09:56,935 --> 00:09:58,534
Uh, congratulations?

155
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,247
Like I needed more people
calling me daddy,

156
00:10:00,271 --> 00:10:03,673
but yes, thanks. We're thrilled.

157
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:04,907
Uh...

158
00:10:04,943 --> 00:10:07,210
Fen, um, could you give us

159
00:10:07,245 --> 00:10:10,379
just like one moment, please?

160
00:10:14,085 --> 00:10:17,553
- Yeah, so I'm here...
- I heard...

161
00:10:17,589 --> 00:10:20,957
you heard...

162
00:10:20,992 --> 00:10:22,892
Alice. I know you two were close.

163
00:10:22,927 --> 00:10:24,493
Please shut up.

164
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:26,529
I am trying to ask if you are okay.

165
00:10:26,564 --> 00:10:27,697
Are you okay?

166
00:10:29,767 --> 00:10:31,634
Okay. I need to know

167
00:10:31,669 --> 00:10:34,837
where your Dicranium
Scoparium Majorus grows.

168
00:10:34,873 --> 00:10:38,107
Are you having a seizure?

169
00:10:38,142 --> 00:10:40,142
Moss? Why?

170
00:10:40,178 --> 00:10:41,277
Fix my hands.

171
00:10:41,312 --> 00:10:42,656
You got a royal botanist or something?

172
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,347
Oh, well, um, we did,

173
00:10:44,382 --> 00:10:47,250
but apparently he sort of
got eaten on the job.

174
00:10:47,285 --> 00:10:49,986
By what? A... a plant?

175
00:10:53,858 --> 00:10:56,792
I hate this place.

176
00:10:56,828 --> 00:11:00,363
Try the royal map-maker.

177
00:11:00,398 --> 00:11:02,398
Love ya.

178
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:07,036
So she's only shown herself
to me that I know of.

179
00:11:07,071 --> 00:11:08,415
I don't know. Maybe I'm tuned into

180
00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:12,141
her ghost channel or something, or...

181
00:11:12,176 --> 00:11:13,587
maybe it has something to do with this.

182
00:11:13,611 --> 00:11:14,911
I don't know.

183
00:11:14,946 --> 00:11:17,246
- I believe you.
- You do?

184
00:11:17,282 --> 00:11:19,382
I know my daughter.
She's trying to protect us.

185
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:21,517
Seeing her like that would be...

186
00:11:21,552 --> 00:11:24,320
very upsetting for her mother and me,

187
00:11:24,355 --> 00:11:26,989
but she led you to this for a reason.

188
00:11:27,025 --> 00:11:28,891
Uh, Alice called a couple of months ago

189
00:11:28,927 --> 00:11:32,628
about some ghost children
trapped in an estate in England.

190
00:11:32,664 --> 00:11:35,164
- The Plover estate.
- Yes, yes, that's the one.

191
00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:37,366
I was delighted to help.
Got a hold of this,

192
00:11:37,402 --> 00:11:40,469
planned to give it to her
when she had the time to visit,

193
00:11:40,505 --> 00:11:42,438
but then...

194
00:11:45,543 --> 00:11:48,678
Well, anyway, you see the ancients had

195
00:11:48,713 --> 00:11:53,482
many ways of dealing with ghosts
out of necessity back then.

196
00:11:53,518 --> 00:11:56,986
Alice's Ka, her soul,

197
00:11:57,021 --> 00:11:58,754
is not at rest, but it can be.

198
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:03,559
Now, one ancient civilization
that really mastered

199
00:12:03,594 --> 00:12:07,229
the whole getting-one's-
soul-to-rest thing...

200
00:12:07,265 --> 00:12:09,966
The Egyptians.

201
00:12:10,001 --> 00:12:13,769
Wait, are you seeing that
Alice wants us to build...

202
00:12:13,805 --> 00:12:15,972
Ecce.

203
00:12:16,007 --> 00:12:18,140
In pyramis.

204
00:12:20,611 --> 00:12:22,311
Oh, my God.

205
00:12:22,347 --> 00:12:23,512
What's going on?

206
00:12:23,548 --> 00:12:25,881
Just another day in the office?

207
00:12:31,956 --> 00:12:34,924
Your majesties,
the much-venerated Emissaries

208
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,559
of our neighbors to the north.

209
00:12:36,594 --> 00:12:40,663
I present Prince Ess of Loria.

210
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,100
I'm sorry...

211
00:12:44,135 --> 00:12:46,002
Princess?

212
00:12:46,037 --> 00:12:48,671
Please, call me Ess.

213
00:12:48,706 --> 00:12:50,439
Prince Ess.

214
00:12:50,475 --> 00:12:54,176
Oh, my God. Fuck your parents, dude.

215
00:12:54,212 --> 00:12:55,344
We got a problem.

216
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,523
You guys have been fucking shit up

217
00:12:56,547 --> 00:12:58,314
- for over half a century.
- Okay.

218
00:12:58,349 --> 00:13:00,049
- This is how Lorians talk?
- And look...

219
00:13:00,084 --> 00:13:01,517
The Prince speaks fluent Earth.

220
00:13:01,552 --> 00:13:06,522
Rumor has it his mother is from,
uh, Cincinn-ah-ti.

221
00:13:06,557 --> 00:13:08,758
Until The Beast drained the Wellspring.

222
00:13:08,793 --> 00:13:11,627
And then... oh, yeah...

223
00:13:11,662 --> 00:13:13,229
you jokers let Ember take a dump...

224
00:13:13,264 --> 00:13:15,531
Get to your point.

225
00:13:15,566 --> 00:13:17,867
Loria depends on
the Wellspring's tributaries,

226
00:13:17,902 --> 00:13:19,769
but now their magic's jacked.
Not enough.

227
00:13:19,804 --> 00:13:23,272
Crops, rivers,
entire species are affected.

228
00:13:23,307 --> 00:13:24,640
- You dicked us over.
- No.

229
00:13:24,675 --> 00:13:26,642
We're trying to fix it, so...

230
00:13:26,677 --> 00:13:28,477
Great, then this should be easy.

231
00:13:28,513 --> 00:13:31,414
I'm here to propose a treaty
between our two kingdoms.

232
00:13:31,449 --> 00:13:34,150
A 50/50 split of the Wellspring.

233
00:13:34,185 --> 00:13:35,751
And to seal the alliance,

234
00:13:35,787 --> 00:13:40,289
I, Crown Prince of Loria,
offer my hand in marriage

235
00:13:40,324 --> 00:13:44,393
to the Virgin Queen Margo.

236
00:13:44,429 --> 00:13:46,929
Um... okay.

237
00:13:46,964 --> 00:13:50,533
- Did he just call me a virgin?
- Bambi, please, let me.

238
00:13:50,568 --> 00:13:53,436
Ess, thank you.

239
00:13:53,471 --> 00:13:56,038
We will consider your generous offer.

240
00:13:56,074 --> 00:13:58,474
- No, we will not.
- Margo, please.

241
00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:02,111
Listen, Princess, I'm not a sharer,

242
00:14:02,146 --> 00:14:05,614
so why don't you walk yourself
and your un-ironic furs

243
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,944
out of my castle?

244
00:14:08,686 --> 00:14:10,119
All right then.

245
00:14:10,154 --> 00:14:14,356
Plan B. Ilario!

246
00:14:14,392 --> 00:14:17,193
- Seriously? A wand?
- Guards!

247
00:14:21,365 --> 00:14:23,043
Listen, I'm friends with
the High King, okay?

248
00:14:23,067 --> 00:14:24,745
I'll make it worth your while
if you just show me

249
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:27,603
- where the goddamn moss grows.
- I told you,

250
00:14:27,638 --> 00:14:29,305
I'll draw your map for you next Thurs...

251
00:14:34,912 --> 00:14:36,779
Shit.

252
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,573
Oh, this is bad.

253
00:14:46,608 --> 00:14:48,875
This is very bad.

254
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,180
Are you fucking kidding me?

255
00:14:53,215 --> 00:14:54,759
Do you understand
that castle's full of people?

256
00:14:54,783 --> 00:14:56,761
Do you understand there isn't
a single accurate map

257
00:14:56,785 --> 00:14:58,452
of this entire place now?

258
00:15:02,825 --> 00:15:06,326
What the...

259
00:15:06,362 --> 00:15:09,696
Shit is radioactive.

260
00:15:09,732 --> 00:15:13,633
Your majesties, welcome to Loria.

261
00:15:25,614 --> 00:15:27,547
You kidnapped our castle?

262
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,082
I'll put it back,

263
00:15:29,118 --> 00:15:31,718
as soon as you come around to my offer.

264
00:15:31,754 --> 00:15:33,020
So many hostages.

265
00:15:33,055 --> 00:15:35,689
I wouldn't try anything if I were you.

266
00:15:35,724 --> 00:15:38,158
Guards? Dungeon.

267
00:15:38,193 --> 00:15:42,462
The rest of you, hang here.

268
00:15:42,498 --> 00:15:44,698
Shit.

269
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:46,199
- Shit.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

270
00:15:46,235 --> 00:15:48,135
I'll jump in the doppel-banger,

271
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:50,237
- and I'll find someone who can...
- What?

272
00:15:50,272 --> 00:15:51,972
- Travel here and help?
- Yes.

273
00:15:52,007 --> 00:15:54,841
Q took the button to
some godforsaken 'burb.

274
00:15:54,877 --> 00:15:56,977
No, you're not leaving me in a castle

275
00:15:57,012 --> 00:15:58,089
full of barbarian frat bros.

276
00:15:58,113 --> 00:15:59,346
Okay, fine,

277
00:15:59,381 --> 00:16:00,914
but while we're talking about them,

278
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:02,360
you could've been a little diplomatic.

279
00:16:02,384 --> 00:16:05,519
By agreeing to marry
a complete stranger on the spot?

280
00:16:05,554 --> 00:16:07,154
I did it.

281
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:09,356
That was different.

282
00:16:09,391 --> 00:16:11,425
You're right, this would only
really be equivalent

283
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,661
if Ess was a girl,
and you found pussy, you know,

284
00:16:14,696 --> 00:16:17,531
interesting in a sometimes-
you-like-Thai-food kinda way,

285
00:16:17,566 --> 00:16:20,801
and now it's all Thai food
forever till you die.

286
00:16:20,836 --> 00:16:23,136
No, he's a man,

287
00:16:23,172 --> 00:16:25,372
who seems arrogant and entitled

288
00:16:25,407 --> 00:16:27,441
and unclear on the concept of consent.

289
00:16:27,476 --> 00:16:31,344
I can't imagine
what could possibly go wrong.

290
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,281
Look, I'm not saying do it. It's just...

291
00:16:34,316 --> 00:16:37,017
You're a queen. I'm a king.

292
00:16:37,052 --> 00:16:38,852
We don't necessarily marry for love.

293
00:16:38,887 --> 00:16:41,688
It's part of the job.

294
00:16:41,723 --> 00:16:43,623
Fine, I'll talk to him,

295
00:16:43,659 --> 00:16:48,061
but only to negotiate us
out of this epic clusterfuck.

296
00:16:48,097 --> 00:16:51,098
I'm staying a virgin.

297
00:16:53,102 --> 00:16:54,801
40 years ago, everything burned down

298
00:16:54,837 --> 00:16:58,271
except this building.

299
00:16:58,307 --> 00:16:59,639
Wait a minute.

300
00:16:59,675 --> 00:17:01,475
Here.

301
00:17:11,887 --> 00:17:13,220
Okay.

302
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:19,392
No way is this sigil 40 years old.

303
00:17:19,428 --> 00:17:21,862
I mean, hardly anything
stays hot that long.

304
00:17:21,897 --> 00:17:24,197
Yeah, except blood. Human blood.

305
00:17:24,233 --> 00:17:26,233
And if that's what it is,
it's the DNA of

306
00:17:26,268 --> 00:17:29,736
whoever cast the banishing,
so let's hope, right?

307
00:17:29,771 --> 00:17:30,871
Yeah.

308
00:17:49,658 --> 00:17:52,626
- How long does it take?
- It should work right away.

309
00:17:52,661 --> 00:17:54,227
It's been decades.

310
00:17:54,263 --> 00:17:56,997
I mean, whoever did the
banishing could be dead by now.

311
00:17:57,032 --> 00:17:59,633
They're... they're probably dead.

312
00:18:03,172 --> 00:18:05,906
Oh, shit, it's her.

313
00:18:05,941 --> 00:18:08,074
It... it's my mom's contact.

314
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,809
Okay, hey, head home, wait, okay?

315
00:18:09,845 --> 00:18:11,044
I gotta go.

316
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:13,146
She can help with the baby situation.

317
00:18:13,182 --> 00:18:16,316
Hello?

318
00:18:22,524 --> 00:18:26,026
The "pyramides" of Giza
provide an excellent blueprint...

319
00:18:26,061 --> 00:18:28,662
specifically,
the one Khufu built to house

320
00:18:28,697 --> 00:18:32,832
the soul of his son, Kawab,
valiantly slain in battle.

321
00:18:32,868 --> 00:18:34,734
Yes, here.

322
00:18:36,405 --> 00:18:38,471
Quentin, let's, uh...

323
00:18:38,507 --> 00:18:42,609
let's not bring Stephanie
into this just yet.

324
00:18:42,644 --> 00:18:44,678
It's too much for her.

325
00:18:49,585 --> 00:18:52,452
Listen, Daniel, I thought
maybe you'd wanna hear about

326
00:18:52,487 --> 00:18:55,188
- what happened to Alice.
- Uh, no...

327
00:18:55,224 --> 00:18:58,225
A blood relative must coax the spirit

328
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:01,695
with a bit of mirror magic.

329
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:03,496
Look into the mirror,

330
00:19:03,532 --> 00:19:07,334
paint a True Image of
the deceased with my words.

331
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:11,238
But first...

332
00:19:17,012 --> 00:19:19,412
Uh, Quentin,

333
00:19:19,448 --> 00:19:22,048
uh, you go up, hang the mirror.

334
00:19:22,084 --> 00:19:26,519
Oh, and... and, uh,
first, uh, memorize this.

335
00:19:26,555 --> 00:19:29,322
- Recite it when you're up there.
- Oh, this looks like Arabic,

336
00:19:29,358 --> 00:19:32,692
- but not...
- Yes, uh, Egyptian Arabic. Eh?

337
00:19:32,728 --> 00:19:33,960
Okay...

338
00:19:33,996 --> 00:19:36,429
Well, my Egyptian Arabic
is a little rusty.

339
00:19:36,465 --> 00:19:38,665
No, you'll... you'll be fine.
Just whatever you do,

340
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,068
don't let the mirror shatter.
I've already enchanted it.

341
00:19:42,104 --> 00:19:46,206
Now, we've only got one shot.

342
00:19:46,241 --> 00:19:47,585
Well, then Daniel,
I think that you should do it.

343
00:19:47,609 --> 00:19:49,309
- You... you do it.
- No.

344
00:19:49,344 --> 00:19:50,655
I mean, if that's important,
and we only have one shot...

345
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:55,115
Now Q... Quentin, please, just... you.

346
00:19:58,186 --> 00:20:01,087
Yeah.

347
00:20:01,123 --> 00:20:03,256
Give me a minute with this.

348
00:20:20,742 --> 00:20:22,542
Oh, my God.

349
00:20:22,577 --> 00:20:24,511
There you are.

350
00:20:52,007 --> 00:20:53,239
Who are you?

351
00:20:53,275 --> 00:20:56,843
Why did you follow me?

352
00:20:56,878 --> 00:20:58,578
Hi.

353
00:20:58,613 --> 00:21:01,748
My name is Julia. I need your help.

354
00:21:01,783 --> 00:21:05,151
It's Reynard. He's back.

355
00:21:07,122 --> 00:21:09,656
- How?
- I...

356
00:21:09,691 --> 00:21:12,826
Look, it's a long story.
It was a mistake.

357
00:21:15,097 --> 00:21:17,130
- He hurt you too, didn't he?
- Okay, I'm sorry.

358
00:21:17,165 --> 00:21:18,932
I'm... I... I... I cannot help you.

359
00:21:18,967 --> 00:21:22,035
What? Wait, I am pregnant.

360
00:21:27,609 --> 00:21:29,342
- He...
- Don't worry,

361
00:21:29,378 --> 00:21:30,910
the thing will never be born.

362
00:21:30,946 --> 00:21:32,846
I don't care if I have to
jump off a building.

363
00:21:32,881 --> 00:21:35,315
But I cannot let him do this
to another woman.

364
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,916
You banished him once.

365
00:21:36,952 --> 00:21:39,819
All I am asking is for you
to teach me how to do it.

366
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:46,826
I think you better come inside.

367
00:22:04,016 --> 00:22:05,783
Oh, shit.

368
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:19,462
Well... Alanis Morissette.

369
00:22:19,497 --> 00:22:23,212
- Alice loved that cat.
- Okay, but why...

370
00:22:23,237 --> 00:22:25,583
I've always had
a terrible fear of heights.

371
00:22:25,608 --> 00:22:27,681
One day, Alanis Morissette
got stuck on the roof.

372
00:22:27,716 --> 00:22:29,883
Alice begged me to get her down,
but I couldn't,

373
00:22:29,918 --> 00:22:32,886
and honestly, I... I yelled at her,

374
00:22:32,921 --> 00:22:34,521
because sometimes that is what one does

375
00:22:34,556 --> 00:22:37,428
when one is ashamed. And the cat...

376
00:22:38,193 --> 00:22:40,561
did not end well.

377
00:22:41,964 --> 00:22:45,499
I don't know if Alice ever forgave me

378
00:22:45,534 --> 00:22:48,669
for not being brave enough.

379
00:22:50,906 --> 00:22:53,206
Maybe she will now.

380
00:22:53,242 --> 00:22:55,542
No, Daniel, you don't have to do that.

381
00:22:55,577 --> 00:22:57,444
Look, I can do it.

382
00:22:57,479 --> 00:23:00,180
No, I can do it.

383
00:23:00,215 --> 00:23:02,315
For Alice.

384
00:23:15,497 --> 00:23:17,431
Voila. Oh...

385
00:23:17,466 --> 00:23:18,532
Whoa.

386
00:23:18,567 --> 00:23:20,333
Daniel.

387
00:23:23,772 --> 00:23:25,539
Yeah, right?

388
00:23:25,574 --> 00:23:27,941
- And then they came across.
- Whoo.

389
00:23:27,976 --> 00:23:30,911
Hey!

390
00:23:30,946 --> 00:23:33,880
Are you kidding me?

391
00:23:33,916 --> 00:23:37,851
Rhaffat jaras. Jaras!

392
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:44,958
So... when's the wedding?

393
00:23:44,993 --> 00:23:47,728
If we forgo the marriage,

394
00:23:47,763 --> 00:23:50,297
I'm willing to grant you periodic access

395
00:23:50,332 --> 00:23:51,332
to the Wellspring...

396
00:23:51,366 --> 00:23:53,567
You think this is a negotiation?

397
00:23:53,602 --> 00:23:57,337
No marriage, no treaty...

398
00:23:57,372 --> 00:23:59,239
no castle back.

399
00:23:59,274 --> 00:24:02,375
Okay, Conan, let me explain to you

400
00:24:02,411 --> 00:24:03,621
how marriage works where I come from.

401
00:24:03,645 --> 00:24:06,012
Oh, spare me. I know.

402
00:24:06,048 --> 00:24:08,181
My mother shipped me off
to Exeter when I was 16.

403
00:24:08,217 --> 00:24:09,649
You?

404
00:24:09,685 --> 00:24:11,885
Fancy New England boarding school?

405
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,386
Had a dorm full of future senators

406
00:24:13,422 --> 00:24:15,856
convinced I was an exchange
student from Iceland.

407
00:24:15,891 --> 00:24:17,457
Point is I get it.

408
00:24:17,493 --> 00:24:19,993
I'm shockingly progressive for a Lorian.

409
00:24:20,028 --> 00:24:22,295
We get married, I'd still
let you speak in public.

410
00:24:22,331 --> 00:24:24,175
- I'd make sure that you...
- Jesus, I'm not marrying you.

411
00:24:24,199 --> 00:24:25,832
You think I wanna marry a virgin?

412
00:24:25,868 --> 00:24:28,401
- This is purely political.
- Oh, my God.

413
00:24:28,437 --> 00:24:30,771
I'm not a virgin.

414
00:24:32,207 --> 00:24:35,308
Look, I've had the best in Loria,

415
00:24:35,344 --> 00:24:38,378
- and Lorians are the best...
- Hm.

416
00:24:38,413 --> 00:24:40,180
So either way...

417
00:24:40,215 --> 00:24:43,984
you're a virgin to me, sweetheart.

418
00:24:44,019 --> 00:24:47,521
I'm not your sweetheart,

419
00:24:47,556 --> 00:24:50,690
and I'm certain that I can bang circles

420
00:24:50,726 --> 00:24:53,894
around your boring little Lorian hoes,

421
00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:56,930
'cause I'm a very smart,

422
00:24:56,965 --> 00:24:59,966
very liberated woman,

423
00:25:00,002 --> 00:25:03,670
and when I set my mind to something,

424
00:25:03,705 --> 00:25:07,507
I master it.

425
00:25:07,543 --> 00:25:10,443
And you've mastered what?

426
00:25:10,479 --> 00:25:12,546
Never touching a man?

427
00:25:12,581 --> 00:25:15,715
Not touching, touching...

428
00:25:17,686 --> 00:25:20,654
I'm good at both.

429
00:25:20,689 --> 00:25:23,290
Oh, you want me to stop?

430
00:25:25,928 --> 00:25:30,864
Say it, or I'll stop.

431
00:25:30,899 --> 00:25:32,866
Don't stop.

432
00:25:32,901 --> 00:25:35,202
Beg me.

433
00:25:35,237 --> 00:25:36,369
I like you.

434
00:25:38,774 --> 00:25:40,819
So you waited until now
to tell me about you and Bayler?

435
00:25:40,843 --> 00:25:43,254
I've been trying to tell you.
It's been a little insane today.

436
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:44,856
I'm not trying to keep secrets from you.

437
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,682
That's my point.
Eliot, please understand.

438
00:25:48,717 --> 00:25:50,750
I had a life before you came.

439
00:25:50,786 --> 00:25:53,353
I had no idea if you even would come.

440
00:25:53,388 --> 00:25:57,190
Fillory is my home, and I care about it.

441
00:25:57,226 --> 00:26:00,026
- So you became a terrorist?
- We're not violent.

442
00:26:00,062 --> 00:26:02,896
I'd call your ex-boyfriend
trying to strangle me

443
00:26:02,931 --> 00:26:06,833
- a little bit violent!
- He's not my...

444
00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:08,301
We were close, yes,

445
00:26:08,337 --> 00:26:11,037
but hurting people was never the plan.

446
00:26:11,073 --> 00:26:13,840
- I have no idea who you are.
- I'm your wife.

447
00:26:13,876 --> 00:26:16,154
- Because your father made you.
- I could've walked out of here

448
00:26:16,178 --> 00:26:19,379
- a long time ago.
- Then why didn't you?

449
00:26:19,414 --> 00:26:21,326
If you hate us so much...
if you hate me so much...

450
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,083
- why didn't you?
- Because I don't.

451
00:26:23,118 --> 00:26:25,252
I believe in you. You think I stayed,

452
00:26:25,287 --> 00:26:28,388
because you're just
so deeply attracted to me?

453
00:26:28,423 --> 00:26:31,892
I am a realist who wants you to succeed.

454
00:26:31,927 --> 00:26:33,460
I want us to.

455
00:26:36,999 --> 00:26:38,932
So what am I supposed to do

456
00:26:38,967 --> 00:26:41,368
with your good friend
in the dungeon, huh?

457
00:26:41,403 --> 00:26:43,970
You should keep him there.
I don't think you can trust him.

458
00:26:44,006 --> 00:26:46,006
Do you think I can trust you?

459
00:26:52,314 --> 00:26:53,546
I was 21.

460
00:26:53,582 --> 00:26:56,182
It didn't seem so crazy
back then to think

461
00:26:56,218 --> 00:26:59,252
I could summon the goddess, do good.

462
00:26:59,288 --> 00:27:01,254
Yeah, that's what I wanted too.

463
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:03,757
I couldn't get rid of the baby either.

464
00:27:03,792 --> 00:27:05,859
What?

465
00:27:05,894 --> 00:27:08,161
I wasn't the only one
he raped that night,

466
00:27:08,196 --> 00:27:11,031
but I was the only one who got pregnant.

467
00:27:11,066 --> 00:27:14,200
- So what did you do?
- I tried everything.

468
00:27:14,236 --> 00:27:17,103
I even thought about killing myself,

469
00:27:17,139 --> 00:27:18,738
but I couldn't go through with it.

470
00:27:18,774 --> 00:27:21,841
You had it?

471
00:27:21,877 --> 00:27:23,610
I'd rather die.

472
00:27:28,917 --> 00:27:31,217
I want to help you, Julia.

473
00:27:31,253 --> 00:27:34,955
I can't banish Reynard again...

474
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:38,124
but you can.

475
00:27:50,706 --> 00:27:51,972
Where's your cat?

476
00:27:52,007 --> 00:27:54,674
Oh, he's around here somewhere.

477
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:56,609
Come on.

478
00:27:56,645 --> 00:27:58,545
Follow me.

479
00:28:08,757 --> 00:28:10,590
You just wait right here, honey.

480
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,293
So sorry about this.

481
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:29,105
Late, Ms. Hansen.

482
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,611
Sit, you have ten minutes
to complete your midterm.

483
00:28:31,731 --> 00:28:34,176
Midterm?

484
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:37,506
But... but I haven't studied.

485
00:28:37,768 --> 00:28:42,251
Even I studied, and I'm dead.

486
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:45,254
Forgot your clothes too? Typical.

487
00:28:49,193 --> 00:28:51,861
Margo? Hey... whoa!

488
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,629
- I swear I was gonna study.
- What?

489
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:56,566
No, no, it's... it's me.
It's actually me.

490
00:28:56,862 --> 00:28:58,397
Oh, God.

491
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:00,197
Oh, God, I'm asleep.

492
00:29:00,232 --> 00:29:01,999
Uh, yeah, you must not be
in imminent danger

493
00:29:02,034 --> 00:29:04,067
if you're napping, wherever you are.

494
00:29:04,103 --> 00:29:06,203
Kidnapped, along with the entire castle.

495
00:29:06,238 --> 00:29:07,478
Yeah, I know, there's a crater.

496
00:29:07,506 --> 00:29:09,840
- Where are you?
- Loria.

497
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:13,377
Some canyon with these
purple-ish rock things.

498
00:29:13,412 --> 00:29:15,879
- Rock things? What...
- Dicks, okay?

499
00:29:15,915 --> 00:29:17,614
They look like dicks.

500
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:19,750
Uh, full-sail or half?

501
00:29:19,785 --> 00:29:22,419
Honestly, it's a variety pack out there.

502
00:29:22,455 --> 00:29:25,856
Okay, uh, I got it. I'll find you.

503
00:29:25,891 --> 00:29:30,093
And Penny, if you ever
tell anyone you saw this...

504
00:29:30,129 --> 00:29:31,628
Ooh... oh, no-no-no-no-no, I'd never.

505
00:29:31,664 --> 00:29:35,833
I, uh... I'd much rather
have you owe me huge.

506
00:29:53,118 --> 00:29:56,119
Scouring the room for a weapon?

507
00:29:56,155 --> 00:29:59,389
You have a look in your eyes,
that's all.

508
00:29:59,425 --> 00:30:01,191
It's called resting bitch face.

509
00:30:12,571 --> 00:30:14,538
The Cock Barrens of Loria.

510
00:30:14,573 --> 00:30:18,475
Okay. Show me where.

511
00:30:22,581 --> 00:30:25,249
There. Right there.

512
00:30:26,886 --> 00:30:31,221
Look, I know this isn't gonna
make anything any better.

513
00:30:33,526 --> 00:30:35,893
I want you know that Alice died a hero.

514
00:30:35,928 --> 00:30:40,163
It's funny...
these stories we tell, hmm?

515
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,611
You'd rather break both of your legs

516
00:30:42,635 --> 00:30:44,801
than have a conversation
with me about this.

517
00:30:44,837 --> 00:30:48,972
I can't stand to think about it.

518
00:30:49,008 --> 00:30:50,307
Do me a favor,

519
00:30:50,342 --> 00:30:54,177
get me a tall glass of
whatever looks strongest.

520
00:30:54,213 --> 00:30:55,946
You're on a lot of painkillers.

521
00:30:55,981 --> 00:30:59,149
My daughter is dead.

522
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,899
Let me guess...

523
00:31:15,935 --> 00:31:18,302
- God.
- My husband said,

524
00:31:18,337 --> 00:31:22,472
"Don't bother me, because
I'm too crazy right now."

525
00:31:25,244 --> 00:31:26,743
Come on.

526
00:31:26,779 --> 00:31:29,713
We gonna finish this or what?

527
00:31:29,748 --> 00:31:31,815
Yeah.

528
00:31:47,967 --> 00:31:51,602
What... what are...

529
00:31:51,637 --> 00:31:54,137
What is that?

530
00:31:54,173 --> 00:31:57,007
Don't be scared.

531
00:31:57,042 --> 00:31:58,675
I don't know what you want
from me, okay?

532
00:31:58,711 --> 00:32:02,879
'Kay. I want you to start
by understanding something,

533
00:32:02,915 --> 00:32:07,017
and I... I... I don't expect you
to like the idea of this,

534
00:32:07,052 --> 00:32:08,518
but you're going to have that baby.

535
00:32:08,554 --> 00:32:09,786
What?

536
00:32:09,822 --> 00:32:14,024
- What the... that is insane.
- Believe me, I know,

537
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:16,960
but that little demigod
growing inside of you

538
00:32:16,996 --> 00:32:19,563
is like a tiny nuclear reactor.

539
00:32:19,598 --> 00:32:22,833
You have one chance
to harness that power

540
00:32:22,868 --> 00:32:24,501
when you give birth.

541
00:32:24,536 --> 00:32:27,137
- Then I don't want that power.
- Yes, you do,

542
00:32:27,172 --> 00:32:29,139
because that's how I banished Reynard,

543
00:32:29,174 --> 00:32:30,907
and that's how you'll do it too,

544
00:32:30,943 --> 00:32:33,610
while in labor with his child.

545
00:32:33,646 --> 00:32:36,880
No!

546
00:32:36,915 --> 00:32:39,650
Not your choice anymore.

547
00:32:48,961 --> 00:32:50,494
Thank you.

548
00:32:50,529 --> 00:32:53,730
Kady, they may be able to help
your friend with her problem,

549
00:32:53,766 --> 00:32:56,767
but listen, I would never ever
do business with them

550
00:32:56,802 --> 00:32:58,502
if I had a choice.

551
00:32:58,537 --> 00:33:01,371
Be careful with people
like this, Maminke.

552
00:33:01,407 --> 00:33:04,541
You don't want to wind up
like your mother.

553
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:07,978
Thanks.

554
00:33:16,422 --> 00:33:18,955
This is Julia. Leave a message.

555
00:33:18,991 --> 00:33:19,991
Shit.

556
00:33:26,218 --> 00:33:28,218
This place is warded up the ass.

557
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:43,600
Shit.

558
00:33:51,366 --> 00:33:54,576
Um, thank you?

559
00:33:56,181 --> 00:33:58,949
You're trapped here too, aren't you?

560
00:34:24,042 --> 00:34:29,312
So if... if I had this baby,
would it be like...

561
00:34:29,348 --> 00:34:32,883
That's not my baby.

562
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:35,886
- That's my Haxenpaxen.
- What?

563
00:34:35,921 --> 00:34:38,955
My Haxenpaxen. I caught it.

564
00:34:38,991 --> 00:34:41,758
Smells unfortunate, but just imagine

565
00:34:41,793 --> 00:34:43,894
what it's giving off magically.

566
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:46,096
Not even a trickster can find us.

567
00:34:46,131 --> 00:34:48,765
We're invisible while we're near him.

568
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,034
Do have to occasionally stock up on food

569
00:34:51,069 --> 00:34:53,904
and kitty litter, though.

570
00:34:53,939 --> 00:34:57,274
How you found me, I suppose.

571
00:34:57,309 --> 00:35:01,111
- So if that's not your child...
- My child is safe.

572
00:35:01,146 --> 00:35:03,213
He'll never know who he really is.

573
00:35:03,248 --> 00:35:06,850
He doesn't even know who I am.
I made sure of it.

574
00:35:06,885 --> 00:35:08,585
It's for the best.

575
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:11,588
He's a good man, Julia.

576
00:35:11,623 --> 00:35:13,757
An influential man.

577
00:35:48,694 --> 00:35:50,026
Kady!

578
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:53,430
Your magic is no good here.

579
00:35:53,465 --> 00:35:56,666
Oh!

580
00:35:56,702 --> 00:35:57,834
What?

581
00:36:00,305 --> 00:36:03,006
Oh, God, what's with Stink-master Flash?

582
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:05,842
Free him too. He's coming with us.

583
00:36:10,782 --> 00:36:13,883
Must've been some negotiation.

584
00:36:13,919 --> 00:36:16,052
Say I did marry him...

585
00:36:16,088 --> 00:36:20,323
- say I...
- Stop, forget what I said.

586
00:36:20,359 --> 00:36:25,662
This whole marriage thing is absurd.

587
00:36:25,697 --> 00:36:28,498
You have no idea
who the other person is.

588
00:36:28,533 --> 00:36:30,667
- It's dangerous.
- If it's that bad,

589
00:36:30,702 --> 00:36:33,103
- have her killed.
- I can't.

590
00:36:33,138 --> 00:36:35,338
We just made a human together.

591
00:36:35,374 --> 00:36:38,074
And the worst is between
the whole lying back

592
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:40,644
and thinking of Fillory,

593
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:44,047
I started to actually like her.

594
00:36:44,082 --> 00:36:47,751
El, what's going on?

595
00:36:47,786 --> 00:36:50,820
One life-altering crisis at a time.

596
00:36:50,856 --> 00:36:52,822
What do you wanna do about the princess?

597
00:36:52,858 --> 00:36:54,557
It's your choice.

598
00:36:54,593 --> 00:36:56,526
I just want what's best for you.

599
00:37:02,134 --> 00:37:03,366
Hey!

600
00:37:03,402 --> 00:37:06,569
I went to the exact spot.
No castle... nothing there.

601
00:37:06,605 --> 00:37:09,072
- It has to be some other dongs.
- There are no more dongs.

602
00:37:09,107 --> 00:37:11,374
That's the only spot
the castle could be.

603
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:13,276
Yeah, well, it doesn't make
any sense unless...

604
00:37:22,421 --> 00:37:27,157
God, please don't let me
be wrong about this.

605
00:37:27,192 --> 00:37:29,159
You guys have been so royally fucked with.

606
00:37:29,194 --> 00:37:32,462
You won't believe where
you've been this whole time.

607
00:37:34,499 --> 00:37:37,467
Okay.

608
00:37:37,502 --> 00:37:39,169
Now you only get one shot, okay?

609
00:37:39,204 --> 00:37:43,006
So remember, you have to tell the truth.

610
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:45,041
I've got this, Quentin.

611
00:37:45,077 --> 00:37:47,343
- Relax.
- Okay.

612
00:37:49,247 --> 00:37:53,650
Oh...

613
00:37:53,685 --> 00:37:55,385
Alice...

614
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:59,389
she needed a strong female role model.

615
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:03,993
She was so lucky to have me for that.

616
00:38:04,029 --> 00:38:05,995
You have to tell the truth.

617
00:38:06,031 --> 00:38:09,699
But that is the truth.

618
00:38:09,735 --> 00:38:12,736
Alice was complicated.

619
00:38:12,771 --> 00:38:14,804
She never figured out how to be a woman.

620
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,006
That's not the truth... not for Alice.

621
00:38:17,042 --> 00:38:20,043
Don't be ridiculous. This is just Alice

622
00:38:20,078 --> 00:38:21,911
up to her usual tricks.

623
00:38:21,947 --> 00:38:23,880
She was always so hard on me.

624
00:38:23,915 --> 00:38:25,315
This is not about you.

625
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:27,183
Will you just for once in your life

626
00:38:27,219 --> 00:38:29,018
put yourself in your daughter's shoes?

627
00:38:29,054 --> 00:38:33,123
What do you want me to say?

628
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:38,895
That I never understood her?

629
00:38:42,167 --> 00:38:45,301
And that I never really tried?

630
00:38:47,773 --> 00:38:53,643
I didn't know having a daughter
would be this hard.

631
00:38:53,678 --> 00:38:55,912
I resented her sometimes.

632
00:38:55,947 --> 00:38:59,251
I...

633
00:38:59,276 --> 00:39:01,486
- I j... I just need a minute.
- No.

634
00:39:01,511 --> 00:39:03,430
- I...
- No.

635
00:39:03,455 --> 00:39:06,153
Come on, we've gotta finish it.
Stephanie!

636
00:39:07,392 --> 00:39:10,293
Ugh.

637
00:39:17,337 --> 00:39:18,638
Idiot.

638
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:26,061
I cast a niffin summoning
and you didn't come.

639
00:39:26,978 --> 00:39:28,544
How? Why?

640
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:29,979
You're wrong.

641
00:39:30,014 --> 00:39:33,115
I was right there.

642
00:39:33,151 --> 00:39:35,418
Oh, Quentin.

643
00:39:35,453 --> 00:39:37,953
We're gonna have so much fun,

644
00:39:37,989 --> 00:39:41,424
just like we did with my parents.

645
00:39:42,994 --> 00:39:46,295
I killed you. My cacodemon...

646
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:49,365
Your cacodemon wasn't
powerful enough to kill me.

647
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,368
It tried, but when it saw
that it couldn't win...

648
00:39:52,403 --> 00:39:56,572
well, let's just say it stuffed
me in a place most convenient.

649
00:39:56,607 --> 00:39:59,575
That stupid tattoo trap on your back.

650
00:40:01,612 --> 00:40:05,214
We're stuck with each other.

651
00:40:06,818 --> 00:40:08,751
Oh, God.

652
00:40:13,257 --> 00:40:17,893
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

653
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,241
Oh! Oh, God.

654
00:40:32,276 --> 00:40:36,112
Too slow. Sorry.

655
00:40:36,147 --> 00:40:39,215
Dana... in the flesh.

656
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,416
I'd heard you were dead.

657
00:40:40,451 --> 00:40:42,618
You hid well. I'm impressed.

658
00:40:42,653 --> 00:40:45,688
What happened? You slipped up.

659
00:40:49,494 --> 00:40:53,395
I think you have some apologizing to do.

660
00:40:53,431 --> 00:40:55,931
Don't you?

661
00:41:05,943 --> 00:41:08,144
I have reached my decision.

662
00:41:08,179 --> 00:41:10,880
I will marry the Prince of Loria,

663
00:41:10,915 --> 00:41:13,115
on one condition.

664
00:41:13,151 --> 00:41:16,786
I want a tour of his kingdom right now.

665
00:41:18,456 --> 00:41:20,890
Wedding first, then a tour.

666
00:41:28,299 --> 00:41:31,233
Last tree, and done.

667
00:41:35,706 --> 00:41:37,273
Oh, no.

668
00:41:37,308 --> 00:41:40,309
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no.

669
00:41:40,344 --> 00:41:43,179
This is the worst day of my life.

670
00:41:43,214 --> 00:41:45,915
I know, right? Crazy illusion magic.

671
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:50,920
So, hey, what do you think
about making that...

672
00:41:50,955 --> 00:41:53,422
Map.

673
00:41:53,457 --> 00:41:55,891
- You drew it for me.
- Yes.

674
00:41:55,927 --> 00:41:59,795
I made an exception.

675
00:41:59,831 --> 00:42:01,297
Thank you.

676
00:42:03,801 --> 00:42:06,869
- You're still batshit crazy, man.
- I heard that.

677
00:42:09,173 --> 00:42:10,773
Margo, please.

678
00:42:10,808 --> 00:42:13,576
- You fucked with us.
- Mm-hmm, yes, he did.

679
00:42:13,611 --> 00:42:16,679
- You fucked with our castle.
- Amen, sister.

680
00:42:16,714 --> 00:42:18,914
And now we're gonna put our Jimmy Choos

681
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:22,451
so far up your ass,
you're gonna taste next season.

682
00:42:22,486 --> 00:42:25,221
Exactly, whatever that means.

683
00:42:25,256 --> 00:42:27,456
Because the High King and I

684
00:42:27,491 --> 00:42:31,093
hereby declare war
on the kingdom of Loria.

685
00:42:31,128 --> 00:42:33,157
Yes!

686
00:42:33,508 --> 00:42:35,703
Wait...

687
00:42:36,934 --> 00:42:38,100
Really?
