1
00:00:00,058 --> 00:00:02,178
Previously on <i>"The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,915
Alice,
whose house is this exactly?

3
00:00:04,035 --> 00:00:06,569
- Alice?
- Hi, Dad.

4
00:00:06,604 --> 00:00:09,972
- You know how I feel about Mom.
- Fine. Stephanie.

5
00:00:10,008 --> 00:00:11,541
Ugh, I just feel like
I'm being pulled back

6
00:00:11,576 --> 00:00:14,110
into this version of me
when I was, like, 12

7
00:00:14,145 --> 00:00:16,546
and furious
and invisible and mute.

8
00:00:16,581 --> 00:00:18,147
You cure your own hands
just fine,

9
00:00:18,183 --> 00:00:20,149
but mine, you can't do
a fucking thing about, huh?

10
00:00:20,185 --> 00:00:21,984
There are other options.

11
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,454
You can travel to Fillory.

12
00:00:24,489 --> 00:00:27,156
Go there, get this.

13
00:00:27,192 --> 00:00:28,524
I'll do what I can.

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,494
You may address me
as Reynard the Fox.

15
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:33,329
<i>Reynard is targeting hedges.</i>

16
00:00:33,364 --> 00:00:35,298
There was a girl.
Forty years ago,

17
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:38,034
she banished Reynard from Earth.

18
00:00:38,069 --> 00:00:40,870
I still don't know
what I'm looking for.

19
00:00:40,905 --> 00:00:44,941
Any sort of strange event
or aberration.

20
00:00:46,578 --> 00:00:49,278
- The test was positive.
- Fuck!

21
00:00:49,314 --> 00:00:50,513
Yeah, so let's just get

22
00:00:50,548 --> 00:00:52,648
this pesky abortion
out of the way.

23
00:00:52,684 --> 00:00:53,684
Kady!

24
00:00:55,653 --> 00:00:59,055
I'm Bayler, a proud soldier
of Fillorians United.

25
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:00,456
I'm not a Fu Fighter anymore.

26
00:01:00,492 --> 00:01:02,391
Help us, or I go to your king,

27
00:01:02,427 --> 00:01:05,128
and tell him exactly
how well I know his wife.

28
00:01:05,163 --> 00:01:06,763
Then I'll tell him myself.

29
00:01:06,798 --> 00:01:08,231
What is she doing?

30
00:01:08,266 --> 00:01:09,932
She can't.
She'll niffin out.

31
00:01:13,004 --> 00:01:15,171
Your turn.

32
00:01:15,206 --> 00:01:17,940
- Quentin says go free.
- Alice!

33
00:01:43,968 --> 00:01:47,904
Um...

34
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:50,239
Remind me again
what summoning Alice's niffin

35
00:01:50,275 --> 00:01:52,875
has to do with the--

36
00:01:52,911 --> 00:01:55,845
tai chi--I mean, ballet.

37
00:01:59,017 --> 00:02:00,950
Ooh.

38
00:02:00,985 --> 00:02:03,052
God, he should never
do that move again.

39
00:02:03,087 --> 00:02:05,555
It's niffin bait.
You have to call to them

40
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:07,256
at their point
of their transformation

41
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:08,491
with something personal.

42
00:02:08,526 --> 00:02:10,793
Oh...
It's a sex thing.

43
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:13,796
No, it's Cirque Du Soleil.
You know Cirque Du Soleil?

44
00:02:13,832 --> 00:02:16,032
You and Alice had sex
to Cirque Du Soleil?

45
00:02:16,067 --> 00:02:17,907
No, it was something
I would do to cheer her up

46
00:02:17,936 --> 00:02:19,702
when she was sad.
It made her laugh.

47
00:02:19,737 --> 00:02:21,237
Ugh.

48
00:02:21,272 --> 00:02:22,872
That just made my heart
hurt a little.

49
00:02:22,907 --> 00:02:25,908
- Shut up.
- I was being sincere.

50
00:02:25,944 --> 00:02:27,143
Does he have the box?

51
00:02:27,178 --> 00:02:28,811
I mean,
what if this actually works?

52
00:02:28,847 --> 00:02:32,548
Yes, but be warned, he wants
to try to reason with her.

53
00:02:32,584 --> 00:02:34,884
She was working on
some sort of reversal spell.

54
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:37,386
He thinks he can
somehow finish it.

55
00:02:37,422 --> 00:02:39,822
He's convinced she wants him to.

56
00:02:39,858 --> 00:02:40,890
Oh, Jesus.

57
00:02:40,925 --> 00:02:43,326
Okay, I'm starting over.

58
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:44,894
No, Q, stop.

59
00:02:44,929 --> 00:02:48,397
If Alice was still a niffin--
if she was still here--

60
00:02:48,433 --> 00:02:50,533
You've been at this an hour.

61
00:02:50,568 --> 00:02:54,537
You can't summon her,
because she's gone.

62
00:02:54,572 --> 00:02:57,073
It's just I saw her--
it felt so real.

63
00:02:57,108 --> 00:02:59,342
Why don't we get you
back to the castle, huh?

64
00:02:59,377 --> 00:03:01,644
Some rest, some food.

65
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:04,213
And hey, there's an entire
kingdom's-worth

66
00:03:04,249 --> 00:03:06,983
of problems to distract you.

67
00:03:07,018 --> 00:03:10,686
We really are beset,
and could use your help.

68
00:03:10,722 --> 00:03:13,389
- I hear you, I'm just--
- Good,<i> vamanos.</i>

69
00:03:13,424 --> 00:03:15,791
Her memorial is tomorrow.

70
00:03:15,827 --> 00:03:18,594
I should go and look
her parents in the eye--

71
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,365
tell them how she died.

72
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,501
And then...

73
00:03:25,536 --> 00:03:27,169
I'll come back to Fillory,

74
00:03:27,205 --> 00:03:30,606
and I'll be a king.
I promise.

75
00:03:30,642 --> 00:03:32,808
Can I trust you with this?
No offense, Q,

76
00:03:32,844 --> 00:03:35,144
you're a little crazy right now.

77
00:03:35,179 --> 00:03:37,647
Maybe, but yeah.

78
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:06,442
Ah, the sacrifice.

79
00:04:06,477 --> 00:04:08,377
Uh, the plinth is
in the backyard.

80
00:04:08,413 --> 00:04:10,846
Follow me.
Just, uh, watch the rug.

81
00:04:13,351 --> 00:04:15,117
Daniel...

82
00:04:15,153 --> 00:04:18,321
reconfigured the entire house,
and still...

83
00:04:18,356 --> 00:04:23,726
everywhere I look, I see
something that Alice touched.

84
00:04:23,761 --> 00:04:26,662
My children loved me.

85
00:04:26,698 --> 00:04:30,032
- I was a good mother.
- You were, Stephanie, you were.

86
00:04:30,068 --> 00:04:32,668
- So much better than my mother.
- Of cour--

87
00:04:32,704 --> 00:04:34,837
What have I done
to deserve this?

88
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:52,154
Um, hi.

89
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,527
Alice?

90
00:05:00,298 --> 00:05:04,533
Alice...

91
00:05:04,569 --> 00:05:06,168
Are you really there?

92
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,377
Okay.

93
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:29,525
You're kind of freaking me out.

94
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,428
I mean, I love you, but you're
very ghost-like right now, so...

95
00:05:36,134 --> 00:05:38,467
Okay.

96
00:05:42,306 --> 00:05:44,440
I can't.

97
00:05:48,513 --> 00:05:50,513
Okay.

98
00:05:50,548 --> 00:05:54,383
Okay, okay...

99
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,954
No.

100
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:02,691
Eliot and Margo are right.
You're--

101
00:06:02,727 --> 00:06:05,895
she's gone,
and you're a little crazy.

102
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,386
Or not.

103
00:06:42,366 --> 00:06:51,698
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny
www.addic7ed.com</font>

104
00:06:54,512 --> 00:06:56,545
Alice.

105
00:07:10,128 --> 00:07:12,428
Just don't jump out at me, okay?

106
00:07:25,143 --> 00:07:27,209
Quentin?

107
00:07:27,245 --> 00:07:28,544
Is that you?

108
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:31,380
Uh, sorry, Mr. Q--
or Daniel. Sorry.

109
00:07:31,415 --> 00:07:32,748
Give me a hug.

110
00:07:37,855 --> 00:07:40,823
How on earth did you get into
my private study?

111
00:07:40,858 --> 00:07:43,058
Uh...

112
00:07:43,094 --> 00:07:45,194
There's, um, something going on.

113
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:53,269
Yeah.

114
00:07:53,304 --> 00:07:54,637
Yeah, got it.

115
00:07:54,672 --> 00:07:55,671
Tell them I'm Hannah's daughter,

116
00:07:55,706 --> 00:07:58,807
and this is an emergency.

117
00:07:58,843 --> 00:08:03,145
Can you just tell her
to call me, please?

118
00:08:03,181 --> 00:08:05,114
- Hey.
- Hey.

119
00:08:05,149 --> 00:08:08,117
Uh, I mixed up your dose.
It's on the counter.

120
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:15,524
To all the heroine
I am not taking.

121
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,859
Cheers.

122
00:08:18,863 --> 00:08:20,529
- Mm.
- Did you get the pickles?

123
00:08:20,565 --> 00:08:21,664
Yep.

124
00:08:26,804 --> 00:08:30,372
You found something.

125
00:08:30,408 --> 00:08:33,209
August 19th, 1976, 7:00 a.m.

126
00:08:33,244 --> 00:08:34,777
An unseasonal hailstorm
hit the Northeast.

127
00:08:34,812 --> 00:08:36,145
Nothing too crazy, right?

128
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,348
An hour later,
a tidal wave slammed into Miami.

129
00:08:39,383 --> 00:08:41,417
Hour after that, hurricanes
struck both the coasts

130
00:08:41,452 --> 00:08:43,018
of Peru, Chile.

131
00:08:43,054 --> 00:08:45,287
I mean, something rippled down
the entire hemisphere,

132
00:08:45,323 --> 00:08:50,326
and if you follow the chain
reaction back to its source...

133
00:08:50,361 --> 00:08:52,895
Hoboken, New Jersey?

134
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,863
Nothing ever starts
in Hoboken, New Jersey.

135
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:58,234
Well, on August 19th,
some time before dawn,

136
00:08:58,269 --> 00:08:59,902
this happened.

137
00:08:59,937 --> 00:09:01,904
Industrial park
burned to the ground.

138
00:09:01,939 --> 00:09:03,772
No one could explain
what caused the fire,

139
00:09:03,808 --> 00:09:07,476
or why it left one single
building standing untouched

140
00:09:07,511 --> 00:09:10,412
with a perfect circle of
burn around it.

141
00:09:15,219 --> 00:09:16,485
Thank you.

142
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,621
Mm.
Mm-hmm.

143
00:09:18,656 --> 00:09:19,788
Next.

144
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,226
- Eliot, I need to talk to you.
- Oh, thank you.

145
00:09:24,262 --> 00:09:27,863
It's about that Fu Fighter
in the dungeon.

146
00:09:27,898 --> 00:09:31,100
What the actual
all-encompassing fuck is this?

147
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,968
Your majesty,
you said you wanted

148
00:09:33,004 --> 00:09:35,838
- a unicorn milk latte.
- I was joking.

149
00:09:35,873 --> 00:09:37,773
Wait, you milked a unicorn?

150
00:09:39,844 --> 00:09:43,679
So listen, about Bayler...

151
00:09:43,714 --> 00:09:47,491
Holy shit,
the walking plot twist returns.

152
00:09:47,526 --> 00:09:49,660
- Hi, I need something.
- Shocker.

153
00:09:49,695 --> 00:09:52,730
Hey, Fen, look who it is.
Uncy Penny.

154
00:09:52,765 --> 00:09:55,699
That's right, I knocked her up.
No big deal.

155
00:09:55,735 --> 00:09:57,334
Uh, congratulations?

156
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,036
Like I needed more people
calling me daddy,

157
00:09:59,071 --> 00:10:02,473
but yes, thanks.
We're thrilled.

158
00:10:02,508 --> 00:10:03,707
Uh...

159
00:10:03,743 --> 00:10:06,010
Fen, um, could you give us

160
00:10:06,045 --> 00:10:09,179
just like one moment, please?

161
00:10:12,885 --> 00:10:16,353
- Yeah, so I'm here--
- I heard--

162
00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:19,757
you heard...

163
00:10:19,792 --> 00:10:21,692
Alice.
I know you two were close.

164
00:10:21,727 --> 00:10:23,293
Please shut up.

165
00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:25,329
I am trying to ask
if you are okay.

166
00:10:25,364 --> 00:10:26,497
Are you okay?

167
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:30,434
Okay.
I need to know

168
00:10:30,469 --> 00:10:33,637
where your Dicranium
Scoparium Majorus grows.

169
00:10:33,673 --> 00:10:36,907
Are you having a seizure?

170
00:10:36,942 --> 00:10:38,942
Moss? Why?

171
00:10:38,978 --> 00:10:40,077
Fix my hands.

172
00:10:40,112 --> 00:10:41,445
You got a royal botanist
or something?

173
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,147
Oh, well, um, we did,

174
00:10:43,182 --> 00:10:46,050
but apparently he sort of
got eaten on the job.

175
00:10:46,085 --> 00:10:48,786
By what?
A--a plant?

176
00:10:52,658 --> 00:10:55,592
I hate this place.

177
00:10:55,628 --> 00:10:59,163
Try the royal map-maker.

178
00:10:59,198 --> 00:11:01,198
Love ya.

179
00:11:01,233 --> 00:11:05,836
So she's only shown herself
to me that I know of.

180
00:11:05,871 --> 00:11:07,204
I don't know.
Maybe I'm tuned into

181
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:10,941
her ghost channel
or something, or...

182
00:11:10,976 --> 00:11:12,376
maybe it has something
to do with this.

183
00:11:12,411 --> 00:11:13,711
I don't know.

184
00:11:13,746 --> 00:11:16,046
- I believe you.
- You do?

185
00:11:16,082 --> 00:11:18,182
I know my daughter.
She's trying to protect us.

186
00:11:18,217 --> 00:11:20,317
Seeing her like that would be...

187
00:11:20,352 --> 00:11:23,120
very upsetting
for her mother and me,

188
00:11:23,155 --> 00:11:25,789
but she led you to this
for a reason.

189
00:11:25,825 --> 00:11:27,691
Uh, Alice called
a couple of months ago

190
00:11:27,727 --> 00:11:31,428
about some ghost children
trapped in an estate in England.

191
00:11:31,464 --> 00:11:33,964
- The Plover estate.
- Yes, yes, that's the one.

192
00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:36,166
I was delighted to help.
Got a hold of this,

193
00:11:36,202 --> 00:11:39,269
planned to give it to her
when she had the time to visit,

194
00:11:39,305 --> 00:11:41,238
but then...

195
00:11:44,343 --> 00:11:47,478
Well, anyway,
you see the ancients had

196
00:11:47,513 --> 00:11:52,282
many ways of dealing with ghosts
out of necessity back then.

197
00:11:52,318 --> 00:11:55,786
Alice's Ka, her soul,

198
00:11:55,821 --> 00:11:57,554
is not at rest, but it can be.

199
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:02,359
Now, one ancient civilization
that really mastered

200
00:12:02,394 --> 00:12:06,029
the whole getting-one's-
soul-to-rest thing--

201
00:12:06,065 --> 00:12:08,766
The Egyptians.

202
00:12:08,801 --> 00:12:12,569
Wait, are you seeing that
Alice wants us to build--

203
00:12:12,605 --> 00:12:14,772
Ecce.

204
00:12:14,807 --> 00:12:16,940
In pyramis.

205
00:12:19,411 --> 00:12:21,111
Oh, my God.

206
00:12:21,147 --> 00:12:22,312
What's going on?

207
00:12:22,348 --> 00:12:24,681
Just another day in the office?

208
00:12:30,756 --> 00:12:33,724
Your majesties,
the much-venerated Emissaries

209
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:35,359
of our neighbors to the north.

210
00:12:35,394 --> 00:12:39,463
I present Prince Ess of Loria.

211
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,900
I'm sorry...

212
00:12:42,935 --> 00:12:44,802
Princess?

213
00:12:44,837 --> 00:12:47,471
Please, call me Ess.

214
00:12:47,506 --> 00:12:49,239
Prince Ess.

215
00:12:49,275 --> 00:12:52,976
Oh, my God.
Fuck your parents, dude.

216
00:12:53,012 --> 00:12:54,144
We got a problem.

217
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,312
You guys have been
fucking shit up

218
00:12:55,347 --> 00:12:57,114
- for over half a century.
- Okay.

219
00:12:57,149 --> 00:12:58,849
- This is how Lorians talk?
- And look...

220
00:12:58,884 --> 00:13:00,317
The Prince speaks fluent Earth.

221
00:13:00,352 --> 00:13:05,322
Rumor has it his mother is from,
uh, Cincinn-ah-ti.

222
00:13:05,357 --> 00:13:07,558
Until The Beast drained
the Wellspring.

223
00:13:07,593 --> 00:13:10,427
And then--oh, yeah--

224
00:13:10,462 --> 00:13:12,029
you jokers let Ember
take a dump--

225
00:13:12,064 --> 00:13:14,331
Get to your point.

226
00:13:14,366 --> 00:13:16,667
Loria depends on
the Wellspring's tributaries,

227
00:13:16,702 --> 00:13:18,569
but now their magic's jacked.
Not enough.

228
00:13:18,604 --> 00:13:22,072
Crops, rivers,
entire species are affected.

229
00:13:22,107 --> 00:13:23,440
- You dicked us over.
- No.

230
00:13:23,475 --> 00:13:25,442
We're trying to fix it, so...

231
00:13:25,477 --> 00:13:27,277
Great, then this should be easy.

232
00:13:27,313 --> 00:13:30,214
I'm here to propose a treaty
between our two kingdoms.

233
00:13:30,249 --> 00:13:32,950
A 50/50 split of the Wellspring.

234
00:13:32,985 --> 00:13:34,551
And to seal the alliance,

235
00:13:34,587 --> 00:13:39,089
I, Crown Prince of Loria,
offer my hand in marriage

236
00:13:39,124 --> 00:13:43,193
to the Virgin Queen Margo.

237
00:13:43,229 --> 00:13:45,729
Um... okay.

238
00:13:45,764 --> 00:13:49,333
- Did he just call me a virgin?
- Bambi, please, let me.

239
00:13:49,368 --> 00:13:52,236
Ess, thank you.

240
00:13:52,271 --> 00:13:54,838
We will consider
your generous offer.

241
00:13:54,874 --> 00:13:57,274
- No, we will not.
- Margo, please.

242
00:13:57,309 --> 00:14:00,911
Listen, Princess,
I'm not a sharer,

243
00:14:00,946 --> 00:14:04,414
so why don't you walk yourself
and your un-ironic furs

244
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:07,451
out of my castle?

245
00:14:07,486 --> 00:14:08,919
All right then.

246
00:14:08,954 --> 00:14:13,156
Plan B.
Ilario!

247
00:14:13,192 --> 00:14:15,993
- Seriously? A wand?
- Guards!

248
00:14:20,165 --> 00:14:21,832
Listen, I'm friends with
the High King, okay?

249
00:14:21,867 --> 00:14:23,533
I'll make it worth your while
if you just show me

250
00:14:23,569 --> 00:14:26,403
- where the goddamn moss grows.
- I told you,

251
00:14:26,438 --> 00:14:28,105
I'll draw your map for you
next Thurs--

252
00:14:33,712 --> 00:14:35,579
Shit.

253
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,173
Oh, this is bad.

254
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,475
This is very bad.

255
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,780
Are you fucking kidding me?

256
00:14:50,815 --> 00:14:52,348
Do you understand
that castle's full of people?

257
00:14:52,383 --> 00:14:54,350
Do you understand there isn't
a single accurate map

258
00:14:54,385 --> 00:14:56,052
of this entire place now?

259
00:15:00,425 --> 00:15:03,926
What the--

260
00:15:03,962 --> 00:15:07,296
Shit is radioactive.

261
00:15:07,332 --> 00:15:11,233
Your majesties,
welcome to Loria.

262
00:15:23,214 --> 00:15:25,147
You kidnapped our castle?

263
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,682
I'll put it back,

264
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:29,318
as soon as you come around
to my offer.

265
00:15:29,354 --> 00:15:30,620
So many hostages.

266
00:15:30,655 --> 00:15:33,289
I wouldn't try anything
if I were you.

267
00:15:33,324 --> 00:15:35,758
Guards? Dungeon.

268
00:15:35,793 --> 00:15:40,062
The rest of you, hang here.

269
00:15:40,098 --> 00:15:42,298
Shit.

270
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,799
- Shit.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

271
00:15:43,835 --> 00:15:45,735
I'll jump in the doppel-banger,

272
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,837
- and I'll find someone who can--
- What?

273
00:15:47,872 --> 00:15:49,572
- Travel here and help?
- Yes.

274
00:15:49,607 --> 00:15:52,441
Q took the button to
some godforsaken 'burb.

275
00:15:52,477 --> 00:15:54,577
No, you're not leaving me
in a castle

276
00:15:54,612 --> 00:15:55,678
full of barbarian frat bros.

277
00:15:55,713 --> 00:15:56,946
Okay, fine,

278
00:15:56,981 --> 00:15:58,514
but while we're talking
about them,

279
00:15:58,549 --> 00:15:59,949
you could've been
a little diplomatic.

280
00:15:59,984 --> 00:16:03,119
By agreeing to marry
a complete stranger on the spot?

281
00:16:03,154 --> 00:16:04,754
I did it.

282
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:06,956
That was different.

283
00:16:06,991 --> 00:16:09,025
You're right, this would only
really be equivalent

284
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,261
if Ess was a girl,
and you found pussy, you know,

285
00:16:12,296 --> 00:16:15,131
interesting in a sometimes-
you-like-Thai-food kinda way,

286
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:18,401
and now it's all Thai food
forever till you die.

287
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,736
No, he's a man,

288
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:22,972
who seems arrogant and entitled

289
00:16:23,007 --> 00:16:25,041
and unclear on
the concept of consent.

290
00:16:25,076 --> 00:16:28,944
I can't imagine
what could possibly go wrong.

291
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,881
Look, I'm not saying do it.
It's just--

292
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,617
You're a queen.
I'm a king.

293
00:16:34,652 --> 00:16:36,452
We don't necessarily
marry for love.

294
00:16:36,487 --> 00:16:39,288
It's part of the job.

295
00:16:39,323 --> 00:16:41,223
Fine, I'll talk to him,

296
00:16:41,259 --> 00:16:45,661
but only to negotiate us
out of this epic clusterfuck.

297
00:16:45,697 --> 00:16:48,698
I'm staying a virgin.

298
00:16:50,702 --> 00:16:52,401
<i>40 years ago,
everything burned down</i>

299
00:16:52,437 --> 00:16:55,871
except this building.

300
00:16:55,907 --> 00:16:57,239
Wait a minute.

301
00:16:57,275 --> 00:16:59,075
Here.

302
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:10,820
Okay.

303
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,992
No way is this sigil
40 years old.

304
00:17:17,028 --> 00:17:19,462
I mean, hardly anything
stays hot that long.

305
00:17:19,497 --> 00:17:21,797
Yeah, except blood.
Human blood.

306
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,833
And if that's what it is,
it's the DNA of

307
00:17:23,868 --> 00:17:27,336
whoever cast the banishing,
so let's hope, right?

308
00:17:27,371 --> 00:17:28,471
Yeah.

309
00:17:47,258 --> 00:17:50,226
- How long does it take?
- It should work right away.

310
00:17:50,261 --> 00:17:51,827
It's been decades.

311
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:54,597
I mean, whoever did the
banishing could be dead by now.

312
00:17:54,632 --> 00:17:57,233
They're--they're probably dead.

313
00:18:00,772 --> 00:18:03,506
Oh, shit, it's her.

314
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,674
It--it's my mom's contact.

315
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,409
Okay, hey,
head home, wait, okay?

316
00:18:07,445 --> 00:18:08,644
I gotta go.

317
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:10,746
She can help
with the baby situation.

318
00:18:10,782 --> 00:18:13,916
Hello?

319
00:18:20,124 --> 00:18:23,626
The "pyramides" of Giza
provide an excellent blueprint--

320
00:18:23,661 --> 00:18:26,262
specifically,
the one Khufu built to house

321
00:18:26,297 --> 00:18:30,432
the soul of his son, Kawab,
valiantly slain in battle.

322
00:18:30,468 --> 00:18:32,334
Yes, here.

323
00:18:34,005 --> 00:18:36,071
Quentin, let's, uh--

324
00:18:36,107 --> 00:18:40,209
let's not bring Stephanie
into this just yet.

325
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,278
It's too much for her.

326
00:18:47,185 --> 00:18:50,052
Listen, Daniel, I thought
maybe you'd wanna hear about

327
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,788
- what happened to Alice.
- Uh, no...

328
00:18:52,824 --> 00:18:55,825
A blood relative
must coax the spirit

329
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,295
with a bit of mirror magic.

330
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:01,096
Look into the mirror,

331
00:19:01,132 --> 00:19:04,934
paint a True Image of
the deceased with my words.

332
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,838
But first...

333
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:17,012
Uh, Quentin,

334
00:19:17,048 --> 00:19:19,648
uh, you go up, hang the mirror.

335
00:19:19,684 --> 00:19:24,119
Oh, and--and, uh,
first, uh, memorize this.

336
00:19:24,155 --> 00:19:26,922
- Recite it when you're up there.
- Oh, this looks like Arabic,

337
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:30,292
- but not--
- Yes, uh, Egyptian Arabic. Eh?

338
00:19:30,328 --> 00:19:31,560
Okay...

339
00:19:31,596 --> 00:19:34,029
Well, my Egyptian Arabic
is a little rusty.

340
00:19:34,065 --> 00:19:36,265
No, you'll--you'll be fine.
Just whatever you do,

341
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,668
don't let the mirror shatter.
I've already enchanted it.

342
00:19:39,704 --> 00:19:43,806
Now, we've only got one shot.

343
00:19:43,841 --> 00:19:45,174
Well, then Daniel,
I think that you should do it.

344
00:19:45,209 --> 00:19:46,909
- You--you do it.
- No.

345
00:19:46,944 --> 00:19:48,244
I mean, if that's important,
and we only have one shot--

346
00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:52,715
Now Q--Quentin,
please, just--you.

347
00:19:55,786 --> 00:19:58,687
Yeah.

348
00:19:58,723 --> 00:20:00,856
Give me a minute with this.

349
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:20,142
Oh, my God.

350
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,111
There you are.

351
00:20:49,607 --> 00:20:50,839
Who are you?

352
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:54,443
Why did you follow me?

353
00:20:54,478 --> 00:20:56,178
Hi.

354
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:59,348
My name is Julia.
I need your help.

355
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:02,751
It's Reynard.
He's back.

356
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:07,256
- How?
- I--

357
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:10,426
Look, it's a long story.
It was a mistake.

358
00:21:12,697 --> 00:21:14,730
- He hurt you too, didn't he?
- Okay, I'm sorry.

359
00:21:14,765 --> 00:21:16,532
I'm--I--I--
I cannot help you.

360
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:19,635
What?
Wait, I am pregnant.

361
00:21:25,209 --> 00:21:26,942
- He...
- Don't worry,

362
00:21:26,978 --> 00:21:28,510
the thing will never be born.

363
00:21:28,546 --> 00:21:30,446
I don't care if I have to
jump off a building.

364
00:21:30,481 --> 00:21:32,915
But I cannot let him do this
to another woman.

365
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,516
You banished him once.

366
00:21:34,552 --> 00:21:37,419
All I am asking is for you
to teach me how to do it.

367
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:44,426
I think you better come inside.

368
00:21:59,516 --> 00:22:01,283
Oh, shit.

369
00:22:10,793 --> 00:22:14,962
Well...
Alanis Morissette.

370
00:22:14,997 --> 00:22:18,499
- Alice loved that cat.
- Okay, but why--

371
00:22:18,534 --> 00:22:20,727
I've always had
a terrible fear of heights.

372
00:22:20,847 --> 00:22:23,181
One day, Alanis Morissette
got stuck on the roof.

373
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:25,383
Alice begged me to get her down,
but I couldn't,

374
00:22:25,418 --> 00:22:28,386
and honestly, I--
I yelled at her,

375
00:22:28,421 --> 00:22:30,021
because sometimes
that is what one does

376
00:22:30,056 --> 00:22:33,658
when one is ashamed.
And the cat...

377
00:22:33,693 --> 00:22:37,428
did not end well.

378
00:22:37,464 --> 00:22:40,999
I don't know if
Alice ever forgave me

379
00:22:41,034 --> 00:22:44,169
for not being brave enough.

380
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,706
Maybe she will now.

381
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:51,042
No, Daniel,
you don't have to do that.

382
00:22:51,077 --> 00:22:52,944
Look, I can do it.

383
00:22:52,979 --> 00:22:55,680
No, I can do it.

384
00:22:55,715 --> 00:22:57,815
For Alice.

385
00:23:10,997 --> 00:23:12,931
Voila.
Oh...

386
00:23:12,966 --> 00:23:14,032
Whoa.

387
00:23:14,067 --> 00:23:15,833
Daniel.

388
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:21,039
Yeah, right?

389
00:23:21,074 --> 00:23:23,441
- And then they came across.
- Whoo.

390
00:23:23,476 --> 00:23:26,411
Hey!

391
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:29,380
Are you kidding me?

392
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:33,351
Rhaffat jaras.
Jaras!

393
00:23:36,556 --> 00:23:40,458
So...
when's the wedding?

394
00:23:40,493 --> 00:23:43,228
If we forgo the marriage,

395
00:23:43,263 --> 00:23:45,797
I'm willing to grant you
periodic access

396
00:23:45,832 --> 00:23:46,832
to the Wellspring--

397
00:23:46,866 --> 00:23:49,067
You think this is a negotiation?

398
00:23:49,102 --> 00:23:52,837
No marriage, no treaty...

399
00:23:52,872 --> 00:23:54,739
no castle back.

400
00:23:54,774 --> 00:23:57,875
Okay, Conan,
let me explain to you

401
00:23:57,911 --> 00:23:59,110
how marriage works
where I come from.

402
00:23:59,145 --> 00:24:01,512
Oh, spare me.
I know.

403
00:24:01,548 --> 00:24:03,681
My mother shipped me off
to Exeter when I was 16.

404
00:24:03,717 --> 00:24:05,149
You?

405
00:24:05,185 --> 00:24:07,385
Fancy New England
boarding school?

406
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,886
Had a dorm
full of future senators

407
00:24:08,922 --> 00:24:11,356
convinced I was an exchange
student from Iceland.

408
00:24:11,391 --> 00:24:12,957
Point is I get it.

409
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,493
I'm shockingly progressive
for a Lorian.

410
00:24:15,528 --> 00:24:17,795
We get married, I'd still
let you speak in public.

411
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,664
- I'd make sure that you--
- Jesus, I'm not marrying you.

412
00:24:19,699 --> 00:24:21,332
You think
I wanna marry a virgin?

413
00:24:21,368 --> 00:24:23,901
- This is purely political.
- Oh, my God.

414
00:24:23,937 --> 00:24:26,271
I'm not a virgin.

415
00:24:27,707 --> 00:24:30,808
Look,
I've had the best in Loria,

416
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,878
- and Lorians are the best...
- Hm.

417
00:24:33,913 --> 00:24:35,680
So either way...

418
00:24:35,715 --> 00:24:39,484
you're a virgin to me,
sweetheart.

419
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:43,021
I'm not your sweetheart,

420
00:24:43,056 --> 00:24:46,190
and I'm certain
that I can bang circles

421
00:24:46,226 --> 00:24:49,394
around your boring
little Lorian hoes,

422
00:24:49,429 --> 00:24:52,430
'cause I'm a very smart,

423
00:24:52,465 --> 00:24:55,466
very liberated woman,

424
00:24:55,502 --> 00:24:59,170
and when I set my mind
to something,

425
00:24:59,205 --> 00:25:03,007
I master it.

426
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:05,943
And you've mastered what?

427
00:25:05,979 --> 00:25:08,046
Never touching a man?

428
00:25:08,081 --> 00:25:11,215
Not touching, touching...

429
00:25:13,186 --> 00:25:16,154
I'm good at both.

430
00:25:16,189 --> 00:25:18,790
Oh, you want me to stop?

431
00:25:21,428 --> 00:25:26,364
Say it, or I'll stop.

432
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:28,366
Don't stop.

433
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,702
Beg me.

434
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:31,869
I like you.

435
00:25:34,274 --> 00:25:36,307
So you waited until now
to tell me about you and Bayler?

436
00:25:36,343 --> 00:25:38,743
I've been trying to tell you.
It's been a little insane today.

437
00:25:38,778 --> 00:25:40,345
I'm not trying to keep
secrets from you.

438
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,182
That's my point.
Eliot, please understand.

439
00:25:44,217 --> 00:25:46,250
I had a life before you came.

440
00:25:46,286 --> 00:25:48,853
I had no idea
if you even would come.

441
00:25:48,888 --> 00:25:52,690
Fillory is my home,
and I care about it.

442
00:25:52,726 --> 00:25:55,526
- So you became a terrorist?
- We're not violent.

443
00:25:55,562 --> 00:25:58,396
I'd call your ex-boyfriend
trying to strangle me

444
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:02,333
- a little bit violent!
- He's not my--

445
00:26:02,369 --> 00:26:03,801
We were close, yes,

446
00:26:03,837 --> 00:26:06,537
but hurting people
was never the plan.

447
00:26:06,573 --> 00:26:09,340
- I have no idea who you are.
- I'm your wife.

448
00:26:09,376 --> 00:26:11,642
- Because your father made you.
- I could've walked out of here

449
00:26:11,678 --> 00:26:14,879
- a long time ago.
- Then why didn't you?

450
00:26:14,914 --> 00:26:16,814
If you hate us so much--
if you hate me so much--

451
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:18,583
- why didn't you?
- Because I don't.

452
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:20,752
I believe in you.
You think I stayed,

453
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:23,888
because you're just
so deeply attracted to me?

454
00:26:23,923 --> 00:26:27,392
I am a realist
who wants you to succeed.

455
00:26:27,427 --> 00:26:28,960
I want us to.

456
00:26:32,499 --> 00:26:34,432
So what am I supposed to do

457
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,868
with your good friend
in the dungeon, huh?

458
00:26:36,903 --> 00:26:39,470
You should keep him there.
I don't think you can trust him.

459
00:26:39,506 --> 00:26:41,506
Do you think I can trust you?

460
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,046
<i>I was 21.</i>

461
00:26:49,082 --> 00:26:51,682
It didn't seem so crazy
back then to think

462
00:26:51,718 --> 00:26:54,752
I could summon the goddess,
do good.

463
00:26:54,788 --> 00:26:56,754
Yeah, that's what I wanted too.

464
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:59,257
I couldn't get rid
of the baby either.

465
00:26:59,292 --> 00:27:01,359
What?

466
00:27:01,394 --> 00:27:03,661
I wasn't the only one
he raped that night,

467
00:27:03,696 --> 00:27:06,531
but I was the only one
who got pregnant.

468
00:27:06,566 --> 00:27:09,700
- So what did you do?
- I tried everything.

469
00:27:09,736 --> 00:27:12,603
I even thought
about killing myself,

470
00:27:12,639 --> 00:27:14,238
but I couldn't go
through with it.

471
00:27:14,274 --> 00:27:17,341
You had it?

472
00:27:17,377 --> 00:27:19,110
I'd rather die.

473
00:27:24,417 --> 00:27:26,717
I want to help you, Julia.

474
00:27:26,753 --> 00:27:30,455
I can't banish Reynard again...

475
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:33,624
but you can.

476
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:47,472
Where's your cat?

477
00:27:47,507 --> 00:27:50,174
Oh, he's around here somewhere.

478
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,109
Come on.

479
00:27:52,145 --> 00:27:54,045
Follow me.

480
00:28:04,257 --> 00:28:06,090
You just wait right here, honey.

481
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,793
So sorry about this.

482
00:28:20,304 --> 00:28:23,305
Late, Ms. Hansen.

483
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,811
Sit, you have ten minutes
to complete your midterm.

484
00:28:25,931 --> 00:28:28,376
Midterm?

485
00:28:28,412 --> 00:28:31,706
But--but I haven't studied.

486
00:28:31,968 --> 00:28:36,451
Even I studied, and I'm dead.

487
00:28:36,487 --> 00:28:39,454
Forgot your clothes too?
Typical.

488
00:28:43,393 --> 00:28:46,061
Margo?
Hey--whoa!

489
00:28:46,096 --> 00:28:47,829
- I swear I was gonna study.
- What?

490
00:28:47,865 --> 00:28:50,766
No, no, it's--it's me.
It's actually me.

491
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,597
Oh, God.

492
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:54,397
Oh, God, I'm asleep.

493
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:56,199
Uh, yeah, you must not be
in imminent danger

494
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,267
if you're napping,
wherever you are.

495
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:00,403
Kidnapped, along with
the entire castle.

496
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:01,678
Yeah, I know, there's a crater.

497
00:29:01,706 --> 00:29:04,040
- Where are you?
- Loria.

498
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:07,577
Some canyon with these
purple-ish rock things.

499
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:10,079
- Rock things? What--
- Dicks, okay?

500
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:11,814
They look like dicks.

501
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,950
Uh, full-sail or half?

502
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:16,619
Honestly, it's a variety pack
out there.

503
00:29:16,655 --> 00:29:20,056
Okay, uh, I got it.
I'll find you.

504
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:24,293
And Penny, if you ever
tell anyone you saw this--

505
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:25,828
Ooh--oh,
no-no-no-no-no, I'd never.

506
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:30,033
I, uh--I'd much rather
have you owe me huge.

507
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:50,319
Scouring the room for a weapon?

508
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:53,589
You have a look in your eyes,
that's all.

509
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,391
It's called resting bitch face.

510
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:08,738
The Cock Barrens of Loria.

511
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:12,675
Okay.
Show me where.

512
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:19,449
There.
Right there.

513
00:30:21,086 --> 00:30:25,421
Look, I know this isn't gonna
make anything any better.

514
00:30:27,726 --> 00:30:30,093
I want you know that
Alice died a hero.

515
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:34,363
It's funny--
these stories we tell, hmm?

516
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,799
You'd rather break
both of your legs

517
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,001
than have a conversation
with me about this.

518
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:43,172
I can't stand to think about it.

519
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,507
Do me a favor,

520
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:48,377
get me a tall glass of
whatever looks strongest.

521
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:50,146
You're on a lot of painkillers.

522
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:53,349
My daughter is dead.

523
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,099
Let me guess...

524
00:31:10,135 --> 00:31:12,502
- God.
- My husband said,

525
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:16,672
"Don't bother me, because
I'm too crazy right now."

526
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:20,943
Come on.

527
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:23,913
We gonna finish this or what?

528
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:26,015
Yeah.

529
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:45,802
What--what are--

530
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:48,337
What is that?

531
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:51,207
Don't be scared.

532
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,875
I don't know what you want
from me, okay?

533
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:57,079
'Kay. I want you to start
by understanding something,

534
00:31:57,115 --> 00:32:01,217
and I--I--I don't expect you
to like the idea of this,

535
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,718
but you're going to
have that baby.

536
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:03,986
What?

537
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:08,224
- What the--that is insane.
- Believe me, I know,

538
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:11,160
but that little demigod
growing inside of you

539
00:32:11,196 --> 00:32:13,763
is like a tiny nuclear reactor.

540
00:32:13,798 --> 00:32:17,033
You have one chance
to harness that power

541
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:18,701
when you give birth.

542
00:32:18,736 --> 00:32:21,337
- Then I don't want that power.
- Yes, you do,

543
00:32:21,372 --> 00:32:23,339
because that's
how I banished Reynard,

544
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:25,107
and that's how you'll do it too,

545
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:27,810
while in labor with his child.

546
00:32:27,846 --> 00:32:31,080
No!

547
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,850
Not your choice anymore.

548
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:44,694
Thank you.

549
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:47,930
Kady, they may be able to help
your friend with her problem,

550
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,967
but listen, I would never ever
do business with them

551
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:52,702
if I had a choice.

552
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:55,571
Be careful with people
like this, Maminke.

553
00:32:55,607 --> 00:32:58,741
You don't want to wind up
like your mother.

554
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:02,178
Thanks.

555
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:13,155
<i>This is Julia.
Leave a message.</i>

556
00:33:13,191 --> 00:33:14,191
Shit.

557
00:33:19,118 --> 00:33:21,118
This place is warded up the ass.

558
00:33:33,499 --> 00:33:36,500
Shit.

559
00:33:44,276 --> 00:33:49,046
Um, thank you?

560
00:33:49,081 --> 00:33:51,849
You're trapped here too,
aren't you?

561
00:34:16,942 --> 00:34:22,212
So if--if I had this baby,
would it be like--

562
00:34:22,248 --> 00:34:25,783
That's not my baby.

563
00:34:25,818 --> 00:34:28,786
- That's my Haxenpaxen.
- What?

564
00:34:28,821 --> 00:34:31,855
My Haxenpaxen.
I caught it.

565
00:34:31,891 --> 00:34:34,658
Smells unfortunate,
but just imagine

566
00:34:34,693 --> 00:34:36,794
what it's giving off magically.

567
00:34:36,829 --> 00:34:38,996
Not even a trickster
can find us.

568
00:34:39,031 --> 00:34:41,665
We're invisible
while we're near him.

569
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,934
Do have to occasionally
stock up on food

570
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:46,804
and kitty litter, though.

571
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:50,174
How you found me, I suppose.

572
00:34:50,209 --> 00:34:54,011
- So if that's not your child--
- My child is safe.

573
00:34:54,046 --> 00:34:56,113
He'll never know
who he really is.

574
00:34:56,148 --> 00:34:59,750
He doesn't even know who I am.
I made sure of it.

575
00:34:59,785 --> 00:35:01,485
It's for the best.

576
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,488
He's a good man, Julia.

577
00:35:04,523 --> 00:35:06,657
An influential man.

578
00:35:41,594 --> 00:35:42,926
Kady!

579
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,330
Your magic is no good here.

580
00:35:46,365 --> 00:35:49,566
Oh!

581
00:35:49,602 --> 00:35:50,734
What?

582
00:35:53,205 --> 00:35:55,906
Oh, God, what's with
Stink-master Flash?

583
00:35:55,941 --> 00:35:58,742
Free him too.
He's coming with us.

584
00:36:03,682 --> 00:36:06,783
Must've been some negotiation.

585
00:36:06,819 --> 00:36:08,952
Say I did marry him--

586
00:36:08,988 --> 00:36:13,223
- say I--
- Stop, forget what I said.

587
00:36:13,259 --> 00:36:18,562
This whole marriage thing
is absurd.

588
00:36:18,597 --> 00:36:21,398
You have no idea
who the other person is.

589
00:36:21,433 --> 00:36:23,567
- It's dangerous.
- If it's that bad,

590
00:36:23,602 --> 00:36:26,003
- have her killed.
- I can't.

591
00:36:26,038 --> 00:36:28,238
We just made a human together.

592
00:36:28,274 --> 00:36:30,974
And the worst is between
the whole lying back

593
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:33,544
and thinking of Fillory,

594
00:36:33,579 --> 00:36:36,947
I started to actually like her.

595
00:36:36,982 --> 00:36:40,651
El, what's going on?

596
00:36:40,686 --> 00:36:43,720
One life-altering
crisis at a time.

597
00:36:43,756 --> 00:36:45,722
What do you wanna do
about the princess?

598
00:36:45,758 --> 00:36:47,457
It's your choice.

599
00:36:47,493 --> 00:36:49,426
I just want what's best for you.

600
00:36:55,034 --> 00:36:56,266
Hey!

601
00:36:56,302 --> 00:36:59,469
I went to the exact spot.
No castle--nothing there.

602
00:36:59,505 --> 00:37:01,972
- It has to be some other dongs.
- There are no more dongs.

603
00:37:02,007 --> 00:37:04,274
That's the only spot
the castle could be.

604
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:06,176
Yeah, well, it doesn't make
any sense unless--

605
00:37:15,321 --> 00:37:20,057
God, please don't let me
be wrong about this.

606
00:37:20,092 --> 00:37:22,059
You guys have been so royally fucked with.

607
00:37:22,094 --> 00:37:25,362
You won't believe where
you've been this whole time.

608
00:37:27,399 --> 00:37:30,367
Okay.

609
00:37:30,402 --> 00:37:32,069
Now you only get one shot, okay?

610
00:37:32,104 --> 00:37:35,906
So remember, you have to
tell the truth.

611
00:37:35,941 --> 00:37:37,941
I've got this, Quentin.

612
00:37:37,977 --> 00:37:40,243
- Relax.
- Okay.

613
00:37:42,147 --> 00:37:46,550
Oh...

614
00:37:46,585 --> 00:37:48,285
Alice--

615
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,289
she needed
a strong female role model.

616
00:37:52,324 --> 00:37:56,893
She was so lucky
to have me for that.

617
00:37:56,929 --> 00:37:58,895
You have to tell the truth.

618
00:37:58,931 --> 00:38:02,599
But that is the truth.

619
00:38:02,635 --> 00:38:05,636
Alice was complicated.

620
00:38:05,671 --> 00:38:07,704
She never figured out
how to be a woman.

621
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,906
That's not the truth--
not for Alice.

622
00:38:09,942 --> 00:38:12,943
Don't be ridiculous.
This is just Alice

623
00:38:12,978 --> 00:38:14,811
up to her usual tricks.

624
00:38:14,847 --> 00:38:16,780
She was always so hard on me.

625
00:38:16,815 --> 00:38:18,215
This is not about you.

626
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:20,083
Will you just
for once in your life

627
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:21,918
put yourself in
your daughter's shoes?

628
00:38:21,954 --> 00:38:26,023
What do you want me to say?

629
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,795
That I never understood her?

630
00:38:35,067 --> 00:38:38,201
And that I never really tried?

631
00:38:40,673 --> 00:38:46,543
I didn't know having a daughter
would be this hard.

632
00:38:46,578 --> 00:38:48,812
I resented her sometimes.

633
00:38:48,847 --> 00:38:52,416
I--

634
00:38:52,451 --> 00:38:54,685
- I j--I just need a minute.
- No.

635
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,319
- I--
- No.

636
00:38:56,355 --> 00:38:59,053
Come on, we've gotta finish it.
Stephanie!

637
00:39:00,292 --> 00:39:03,193
Ugh.

638
00:39:10,402 --> 00:39:11,703
Idiot.

639
00:39:15,308 --> 00:39:17,661
I cast a niffin summoning
and you didn't come.

640
00:39:18,578 --> 00:39:20,144
How? Why?

641
00:39:20,179 --> 00:39:21,579
You're wrong.

642
00:39:21,614 --> 00:39:24,715
I was right there.

643
00:39:24,751 --> 00:39:27,018
Oh, Quentin.

644
00:39:27,053 --> 00:39:29,553
We're gonna have so much fun,

645
00:39:29,589 --> 00:39:33,024
just like we did
with my parents.

646
00:39:34,594 --> 00:39:37,895
I killed you.
My cacodemon--

647
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:40,965
Your cacodemon wasn't
powerful enough to kill me.

648
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,968
It tried, but when it saw
that it couldn't win--

649
00:39:44,003 --> 00:39:48,172
well, let's just say it stuffed
me in a place most convenient.

650
00:39:48,207 --> 00:39:51,175
That stupid tattoo trap
on your back.

651
00:39:53,212 --> 00:39:56,814
We're stuck with each other.

652
00:39:58,418 --> 00:40:00,351
Oh, God.

653
00:40:04,857 --> 00:40:09,493
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

654
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,841
Oh! Oh, God.

655
00:40:23,876 --> 00:40:27,712
Too slow.
Sorry.

656
00:40:27,747 --> 00:40:30,815
Dana...
in the flesh.

657
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:32,016
I'd heard you were dead.

658
00:40:32,051 --> 00:40:34,218
You hid well.
I'm impressed.

659
00:40:34,253 --> 00:40:37,288
What happened?
You slipped up.

660
00:40:41,094 --> 00:40:44,995
I think you have
some apologizing to do.

661
00:40:45,031 --> 00:40:47,531
Don't you?

662
00:40:57,543 --> 00:40:59,744
I have reached my decision.

663
00:40:59,779 --> 00:41:02,480
I will marry
the Prince of Loria,

664
00:41:02,515 --> 00:41:04,715
on one condition.

665
00:41:04,751 --> 00:41:08,386
I want a tour of his kingdom
right now.

666
00:41:10,056 --> 00:41:12,490
Wedding first, then a tour.

667
00:41:19,899 --> 00:41:22,833
Last tree, and done.

668
00:41:27,306 --> 00:41:28,873
Oh, no.

669
00:41:28,908 --> 00:41:31,909
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-
no-no-no-no-no-no.

670
00:41:31,944 --> 00:41:34,779
This is the worst day
of my life.

671
00:41:34,814 --> 00:41:37,515
I know, right?
Crazy illusion magic.

672
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:42,520
So, hey, what do you think
about making that--

673
00:41:42,555 --> 00:41:45,022
Map.

674
00:41:45,057 --> 00:41:47,491
- You drew it for me.
- Yes.

675
00:41:47,527 --> 00:41:51,395
I made an exception.

676
00:41:51,431 --> 00:41:52,897
Thank you.

677
00:41:55,401 --> 00:41:58,469
- You're still batshit crazy, man.
- I heard that.

678
00:42:00,773 --> 00:42:02,373
Margo, please.

679
00:42:02,408 --> 00:42:05,176
- You fucked with us.
- Mm-hmm, yes, he did.

680
00:42:05,211 --> 00:42:08,279
- You fucked with our castle.
- Amen, sister.

681
00:42:08,314 --> 00:42:10,514
And now we're gonna put
our Jimmy Choos

682
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:14,051
so far up your ass,
you're gonna taste next season.

683
00:42:14,086 --> 00:42:16,821
Exactly, whatever that means.

684
00:42:16,856 --> 00:42:19,056
Because the High King and I

685
00:42:19,091 --> 00:42:22,693
hereby declare war
on the kingdom of Loria.

686
00:42:22,728 --> 00:42:25,229
Yes!

687
00:42:25,264 --> 00:42:28,499
Wait...

688
00:42:28,534 --> 00:42:29,700
Really?

689
