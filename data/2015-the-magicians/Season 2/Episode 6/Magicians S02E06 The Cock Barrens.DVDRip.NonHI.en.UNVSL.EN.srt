00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:03,061
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:03,136 --> 00:00:04,798
Alice, whose house
is this, exactly?

3
00:00:04,972 --> 00:00:06,065
Alice.

4
00:00:06,139 --> 00:00:07,139
Hi, Dad.

5
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:09,976
You know how I feel about "Mom."

6
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:11,409
Fine. Stephanie.

7
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:13,709
Ugh! I just feel like I'm
being pulled back into this

8
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:18,115
version of me when I was, like, 12
and furious and invisible and mute.

9
00:00:18,218 --> 00:00:19,618
You cure your
own hands just fine,

10
00:00:19,686 --> 00:00:21,197
but mine you can't do a
fucking thing about, huh?

11
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:22,985
There are other options.

12
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,459
You can travel to Fillory.

13
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:28,286
Go there. Get this.

14
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:29,660
I do what I can.

15
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,365
You may address me
as Reynard the Fox.

16
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,597
<i>Reynard is targeting Hedges.</i>

17
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:35,959
There was a girl.

18
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,200
Forty years ago, she
banished Reynard from Earth.

19
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,505
I still don't know
what I'm looking for.

20
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:44,875
<i>Any sort of strange
event or aberration.</i>

21
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:49,381
<i>The test was positive.</i>

22
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:50,642
Fuck!

23
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,551
<i>Yeah, so let's just get this
pesky abortion out of the way.</i>

24
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,620
Kady!

25
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,085
I'm Bayler, a proud
soldier of Fillorians United.

26
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:01,956
I'm not a FU Fighter anymore.

27
00:01:02,029 --> 00:01:06,364
Help us, or I go to your king and tell
him exactly how well I know his wife.

28
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:07,799
Then I'll tell him myself.

29
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:09,862
What's she doing?

30
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:11,097
She can't, she'll Niffin out.

31
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:15,436
Your turn.

32
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:17,834
Quentin says go free.

33
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:18,911
Alice!

34
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,688
Help me.

35
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,305
Um...

36
00:01:49,343 --> 00:01:53,439
Remind me again what summoning
Alice's Niffin has to do with the...

37
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:55,242
Tai chi?

38
00:01:55,315 --> 00:01:56,681
I mean, ballet.

39
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:01,248
Ugh. Oh...

40
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:04,514
God, he should never
do that move again.

41
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:05,923
It's Niffin bait.

42
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,404
You have to call to them at
their point of their transformation

43
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:09,987
with something personal.

44
00:02:10,063 --> 00:02:11,258
Oh.

45
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:12,492
It's a sex thing.

46
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:15,092
No, it's Cirque Du Soleil.
You know Cirque Du Soleil?

47
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,569
You and Alice had
sex to Cirque Du Soleil?

48
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:19,382
No, it was something I
would do to cheer her up

49
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:20,783
when she was sad.
It made her laugh.

50
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:21,807
Oh...

51
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,342
That just made my
heart hurt a little.

52
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:26,505
Shut up. I was being sincere.

53
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:28,208
Does he have the box?

54
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:30,146
I mean, what if
this actually works?

55
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:33,278
Yes, but be warned, he
wants to try to reason with her.

56
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:36,188
She was working on
some sort of reversal spell.

57
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:38,122
He thinks he can
somehow finish it.

58
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:42,118
He's convinced she
wants him to. Oh, Jesus.

59
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:46,063
Okay, I'm starting
over. No, Q, stop.

60
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:49,570
If Alice was still a Niffin,
if she was still here...

61
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:51,730
You've been at this an hour.

62
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:54,536
You can't summon
her because she's gone.

63
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:58,343
It's just that I saw
her. It felt so real.

64
00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:00,608
Why don't we get you
back to the castle, huh?

65
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,912
Some rest, some food.

66
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:07,353
And hey, there's an entire kingdom's
worth of problems to distract you.

67
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,813
We really are beset
and could use your help.

68
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,357
I hear you. I just...

69
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:14,656
Good. <i>VÃ¡monos.</i>

70
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,856
Her memorial is tomorrow.

71
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,599
I should go and look
her parents in the eye,

72
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,401
tell them how she died.

73
00:03:23,737 --> 00:03:25,171
And then...

74
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,775
I'll come back to Fillory,

75
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:31,402
and I'll be a king. I promise.

76
00:03:31,978 --> 00:03:36,313
Can I trust you with this? No offense,
Q, you're a little crazy right now.

77
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,352
Maybe. But yeah.

78
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,874
Ah, the sacrifice.

79
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,712
The plinth is in the backyard.

80
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:12,218
Follow me. Just watch the rug.

81
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:19,891
Daniel reconfigured the
entire house, and still,

82
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,920
everywhere I look, I see
something that Alice touched.

83
00:04:25,132 --> 00:04:27,431
My children loved me.

84
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:29,630
I was a good mother.

85
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:31,296
You were, Stephanie, you were.

86
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:33,799
So much better than
my mother. Of course...

87
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:36,002
What have I done
to deserve this?

88
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,390
Um...

89
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:53,557
Hi.

90
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,898
Alice?

91
00:05:01,568 --> 00:05:03,036
Alice...

92
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:07,465
Are you really there?

93
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,447
Okay.

94
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,921
You're kind of freaking me out.

95
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:34,297
I mean, I love you, but you're
very ghost-like right now, so...

96
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:38,603
Okay.

97
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,068
I can't.

98
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:50,775
Okay.

99
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,276
Okay, okay...

100
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,551
No.

101
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,388
Eliot and Margo
are right. You're...

102
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:06,657
She's gone, and
you're a little crazy.

103
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,658
Or not.

104
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,183
Alice.

105
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,522
Yeah, okay.

106
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:13,558
Just don't jump out at me, okay?

107
00:07:26,246 --> 00:07:27,578
Quentin?

108
00:07:28,515 --> 00:07:29,778
Is that you?

109
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:32,513
Uh, Sorry, Mr. Q...
Uh, Daniel. Sorry.

110
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:33,745
Give me a hug.

111
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,720
How on earth did you
get into my private study?

112
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:42,795
Uh...

113
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:46,458
There's something going on.

114
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,329
Yeah.

115
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:55,802
Yeah, I got it.

116
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:58,777
Tell her I'm Hannah's daughter,
and this is an emergency.

117
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:02,513
Can you just tell her
to call me, please?

118
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,318
Hey. Hey.

119
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:09,248
Uh, I mixed up your
dose. It's on the counter.

120
00:08:14,094 --> 00:08:16,791
To all the heroin
I am not taking.

121
00:08:16,863 --> 00:08:18,161
Cheers.

122
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,192
Did you get the
pickles? Mmm. Yup.

123
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:29,700
You found something.

124
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:34,510
August 19th, 1976, 7:00 a.m.

125
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:37,551
An unseasonal hailstorm hit the
Northeast. Nothing too crazy, right?

126
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:40,644
An hour later, a tidal
wave slammed into Miami.

127
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,316
Hour after that, hurricanes struck
both the coasts of Peru, Chile.

128
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:46,587
I mean, something rippled
down the entire hemisphere,

129
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:50,187
and if you follow the chain
reaction back to its source...

130
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,326
Hoboken, New Jersey?

131
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,168
Nothing ever starts in
Hoboken, New Jersey.

132
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:59,297
Well, on August 19th,
sometime before dawn,

133
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,533
this happened.

134
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:03,236
Industrial park
burned to the ground.

135
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:05,107
No one could explain
what caused the fire,

136
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:08,842
or why it left one single
building standing untouched

137
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:10,475
with a perfect circle
of burn around it.

138
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:18,651
Thank you. Mmm-hmm.

139
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,857
Mmm-hmm. Next.

140
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,775
Eliot, I need to talk
to you. Oh, thank you.

141
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:28,325
It's about that FU
Fighter in the dungeon.

142
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:32,431
What the actual
all-encompassing fuck is this?

143
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,337
Your Majesty, you said you
wanted a unicorn milk latte.

144
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,535
I was joking.

145
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:38,805
Wait, you milked a unicorn?

146
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:43,409
So listen, about Bayler...

147
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:48,883
Holy shit, the walking
plot twist returns.

148
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,821
Hi, I need something. Shocker.

149
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,485
Hey, Fen, look who
it is. Unky Penny.

150
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,288
That's right, I knocked
her up. No big deal.

151
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:58,762
Congratulations?

152
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:00,509
Like I needed more
people calling me Daddy,

153
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,593
but yes, thanks. We're thrilled.

154
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,670
Uh...

155
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:09,472
Fen, um, could you give us
just like one moment, please?

156
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:10,542
Hmm.

157
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,375
Yeah, so I'm here...

158
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,848
I heard...

159
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,018
You heard...

160
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:22,920
Alice. I know you
two were close.

161
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,514
Please shut up.

162
00:10:24,591 --> 00:10:26,423
I am trying to ask
if you are okay.

163
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:27,620
Are you okay?

164
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,288
Okay.

165
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,766
I need to know where your
Dicranium Scoparium Majorus grows.

166
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:36,234
Are you having a seizure?

167
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,339
Moss? Why?

168
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:41,430
Fix my hands.

169
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:42,618
You got a royal
botanist or something?

170
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,611
Oh, well, um, we did,

171
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:47,169
but apparently he sort
of got eaten on the job.

172
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:49,506
By what? A plant?

173
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,517
I hate this place.

174
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,247
Try the royal map-maker.

175
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:02,660
Love ya.

176
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:05,460
So she's only shown
herself to me that I know of.

177
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,200
I don't know.

178
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:10,669
Maybe I'm tuned into her
ghost channel or something, or...

179
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:14,385
Maybe it has something
to do with this. I don't know.

180
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,169
I believe you.

181
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,335
You do?

182
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,538
I know my daughter.
She's trying to protect us.

183
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:24,516
Seeing her like that would be very
upsetting for her mother and me,

184
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,279
but she led you
to this for a reason.

185
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,185
Alice called a
couple of months ago

186
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:32,919
about some ghost children
trapped in an estate in England.

187
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:35,461
The Plover Estate.
Yes, yes, that's the one.

188
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,463
I was delighted to
help. Got a hold of this,

189
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,524
planned to give it to her when
she had the time to visit, but then...

190
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:49,005
Well, anyway, you
see, the ancients had

191
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:53,536
many ways of dealing with
ghosts out of necessity back then.

192
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:56,515
Alice's Ka, her soul,

193
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,085
is not at rest, but it can be.

194
00:11:59,452 --> 00:12:03,856
Now, one ancient
civilization that really mastered

195
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:07,291
the whole getting-one's-
soul-to-rest thing...

196
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,828
The Egyptians.

197
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:12,823
Wait, are you saying that
Alice wants us to build...

198
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,395
Ecce.

199
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,038
In pyramis.

200
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:22,669
Oh, my God.

201
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,869
What's going on?

202
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:26,276
Just another day in the office?

203
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:35,087
Your Majesties, the
much-venerated emissaries

204
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:36,554
of our neighbors to the north.

205
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:39,855
I present Prince Ess of Loria.

206
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:43,552
I'm sorry...

207
00:12:45,031 --> 00:12:46,090
Princess?

208
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,264
Please, call me Ess.

209
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:50,431
Prince Ess.

210
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:53,632
Oh, my God. Fuck
your parents, dude.

211
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:55,266
We've got a problem.

212
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,486
You guys have been fucking
shit up for over half a century.

213
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,569
Okay.

214
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:00,222
This is how Lorians talk?
- And look...

215
00:13:00,246 --> 00:13:01,690
The Prince speaks fluent Earth.

216
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:05,617
Rumor has it his mother
is from, uh... Cincinn-ah-ti.

217
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:06,744
Oh...

218
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,811
until The Beast
drained the Wellspring.

219
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:11,153
And then, oh, yeah...

220
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:14,453
You jokers let Ember take
a dump... Get to your point.

221
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:17,994
Loria depends on the
Wellspring's tributaries,

222
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:19,929
but now their magic's
jacked. Not enough.

223
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,761
Crops, rivers, entire
species are affected.

224
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:24,827
You dicked us over. No.

225
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,839
We're trying to fix it, so...

226
00:13:26,906 --> 00:13:28,670
Great, then this should be easy.

227
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:31,506
I'm here to propose a treaty
between our two kingdoms.

228
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:34,240
A 50-50 split of the Wellspring.

229
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,891
And to seal the alliance,

230
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:39,545
I, Crown Prince of Loria,
offer my hand in marriage

231
00:13:40,253 --> 00:13:41,721
to the Virgin Queen Margo.

232
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:47,020
Um... Okay.

233
00:13:47,093 --> 00:13:50,086
Did he just call me a
virgin? Bambi, please, let me.

234
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:53,465
Ess, thank you.

235
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:56,025
We will consider
your generous offer.

236
00:13:56,102 --> 00:13:57,195
No, we will not.

237
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:58,465
Margo, please.

238
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,903
Listen, Prince Ess,
I'm not a sharer,

239
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:05,745
so why don't you walk
yourself and your un-ironic furs

240
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:07,178
out of my castle?

241
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:10,148
All right then.

242
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:12,343
Plan B. Ilario!

243
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:15,954
Seriously? A wand?

244
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,354
Guards!

245
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,238
Listen, I'm friends with
the High King, okay?

246
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:24,940
I'll make it worth your
while if you just show me

247
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:26,364
where the goddamn moss grows.

248
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:27,764
I told you,

249
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:29,735
I'll draw your
map for you next...

250
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,637
Shit.

251
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:46,180
Oh, this is bad.

252
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,089
This is very bad.

253
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:53,726
Are you fucking kidding me?

254
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:55,337
Do you understand that
castle's full of people?

255
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,339
Do you understand there
isn't a single accurate map

256
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,025
of this entire place now?

257
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,632
What the...

258
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:08,703
Shit is radioactive.

259
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:14,212
Your Majesties,
welcome to Loria.

260
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:17,379
What? Oh, my God!

261
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,026
You kidnapped our castle?

262
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,657
I'll put it back,

263
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:31,425
as soon as you come
around to my offer.

264
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:33,594
So many hostages.

265
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,794
I wouldn't try
anything if I were you.

266
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:38,068
Guards? Dungeon.

267
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:41,365
The rest of you, hang here.

268
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,341
Shit.

269
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,771
Shit.

270
00:15:45,845 --> 00:15:47,022
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

271
00:15:47,046 --> 00:15:48,742
I'll jump in the doppelbanger,

272
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:50,841
and I'll find someone
who can... What?

273
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:52,579
Travel here and help? Yes.

274
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:55,383
Q took the button to
some godforsaken 'burb.

275
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:59,415
No, you're not leaving me in a
castle full of barbarian frat bros.

276
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:01,586
Okay, fine, but while
we're talking about them,

277
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:03,105
you could've been
a little diplomatic.

278
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,894
By agreeing to marry a
complete stranger on the spot?

279
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,092
I did it.

280
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:08,995
That was different.

281
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:12,037
You're right, this would
only really be equivalent

282
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:15,336
if Ess was a girl, and you
found pussy, you know,

283
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:18,276
interesting in a "sometimes
you like Thai food" kind of way,

284
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:21,439
and now it's all Thai
food forever till you die.

285
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:23,779
No, he's a man,

286
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,944
who seems arrogant and entitled

287
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,179
and unclear on the
concept of consent.

288
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:31,986
I can't imagine what
could possibly go wrong.

289
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,289
Look, I'm not
saying do it. It's just...

290
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,486
You're a queen. I'm a king.

291
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:39,395
We don't necessarily
marry for love.

292
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,093
It's part of the job.

293
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,270
Fine, I'll talk to him,

294
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:47,671
but only to negotiate us
out of this epic clusterfuck.

295
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,606
I'm staying a virgin.

296
00:16:53,813 --> 00:16:56,681
Forty years ago, everything
burned down except this building.

297
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:00,118
Wait a minute.

298
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,245
Here.

299
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:13,930
Okay.

300
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:20,069
No way is this
sigil 40 years old.

301
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:22,131
I mean, hardly anything
stays hot that long.

302
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:24,501
Yeah, except blood. Human blood.

303
00:17:24,944 --> 00:17:26,207
And if that's what it is,

304
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:30,046
it's the DNA of whoever cast
the banishing, so let's hope, right?

305
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:31,209
Yeah.

306
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,701
How long does it take?

307
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:53,330
It should work right away.

308
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:54,533
It's been decades.

309
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:57,042
I mean, whoever did the
banishing could be dead by now.

310
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:59,168
Well, they're probably dead.

311
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,213
Oh, shit, it's her.

312
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,317
It's my mom's contact.

313
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:10,550
Hey, head home, wait, okay?

314
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:11,784
I gotta go.

315
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:13,883
She can help with
the baby situation.

316
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,223
Hello? Good.

317
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:26,761
The pyramids of Giza
provide an excellent blueprint,

318
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,070
specifically the one Khufu built

319
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:33,272
to house the soul of his son,
Kawab, valiantly slain in battle.

320
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:34,607
Yes, here.

321
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:37,773
Ow.

322
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,250
Quentin, let's, uh...

323
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:42,186
Let's not bring
Stephanie into this just yet.

324
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:45,119
It's too much for her.

325
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:53,027
Listen, Daniel, I thought
maybe you'd wanna hear about

326
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:55,432
what happened
to Alice. Uh, no...

327
00:18:55,968 --> 00:19:00,872
A blood relative must coax the
spirit with a bit of mirror magic.

328
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,038
Look into the mirror,

329
00:19:04,343 --> 00:19:07,711
paint a true image of the
deceased with my words.

330
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:10,680
But first...

331
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:18,556
Ah...

332
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:20,151
Quentin,

333
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,653
uh, you go up, hang the mirror.

334
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:24,287
Oh, and, uh...

335
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:27,333
First, uh, memorize this.

336
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,993
Recite it when you're up there.

337
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:30,730
This looks like
Arabic, but not...

338
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:32,635
Yes, Egyptian Arabic.

339
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,640
Huh? Okay...

340
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:37,108
Well, my Egyptian
Arabic is a little rusty.

341
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,369
No, you'll be fine.
Just whatever you do,

342
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:42,438
don't let the mirror shatter.
I've already enchanted it.

343
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:43,615
Now...

344
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,810
We've only got one shot.

345
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:48,764
Well, then Daniel, I
think that you should do it.

346
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:51,849
You do it. No. I mean,
if it's that important...

347
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,722
No, Quentin, please. Just you.

348
00:19:58,631 --> 00:19:59,655
Yeah.

349
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:03,629
Give me a minute with this.

350
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,249
Oh, my God.

351
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:24,015
There you are.

352
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:53,408
Who are you?

353
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:54,918
Why did you follow me?

354
00:20:57,156 --> 00:20:58,180
Hi.

355
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:01,285
My name is Julia.
I need your help.

356
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,860
It's Reynard. He's back.

357
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,501
How?

358
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,704
Look, it's a long
story. It was a mistake.

359
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:17,934
He hurt you too, didn't
he? Okay, I'm sorry.

360
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,774
I'm... I cannot help you.

361
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,005
What? Wait, I am pregnant.

362
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:29,213
He... Don't worry,

363
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:31,551
the thing will never be born.

364
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,558
I don't care if I have
to jump off a building.

365
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,788
But I cannot let him do
this to another woman.

366
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:37,523
You banished him once.

367
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:39,929
All I am asking is for you
to teach me how to do it.

368
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,339
I think you better come inside.

369
00:22:05,457 --> 00:22:06,457
Oh! Shit.

370
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:19,366
Well... Alanis Morissette.

371
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,275
Alice loved that cat.

372
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,342
Okay, but why...

373
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,641
I've always had a
terrible fear of heights.

374
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:29,011
One day, Alanis Morissette
got stuck on the roof.

375
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:31,209
Alice begged me to get
her down, but I couldn't,

376
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:34,219
and honestly, I yelled at her,

377
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:36,531
because sometimes that is what
one does when one is ashamed.

378
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:38,183
And the cat...

379
00:22:39,258 --> 00:22:41,420
It did not end well.

380
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,994
I don't know if Alice
ever forgave me

381
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:49,497
for not being brave enough.

382
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,302
Maybe she will now.

383
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,104
No, Daniel, you don't have
to do that. Look, I can do it.

384
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,240
No, I can do it.

385
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,306
For Alice.

386
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:10,255
There.

387
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:18,329
Oh!

388
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:20,565
Whoa, whoa! Ow.

389
00:23:20,766 --> 00:23:21,961
Daniel.

390
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:26,936
Yeah, right?

391
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:28,167
And then they came across.

392
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,367
Hey.

393
00:23:32,111 --> 00:23:33,807
Are you kidding me?

394
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:43,321
So...

395
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:45,623
When's the wedding?

396
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:48,387
If we forgo the marriage,

397
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:52,286
I'm willing to grant you periodic
access to the Wellspring...

398
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,560
You think this is a negotiation?

399
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,465
No marriage, no treaty...

400
00:23:58,237 --> 00:23:59,364
No castle back.

401
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,474
Okay, Conan,

402
00:24:02,641 --> 00:24:05,042
let me explain to you how
marriage works where I come from.

403
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,942
Oh, spare me. I know.

404
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,305
My mother shipped me
off to Exeter when I was 16.

405
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:10,405
You?

406
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:13,011
Fancy New England
boarding school?

407
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:14,819
Had a dorm full
of future senators

408
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:16,807
convinced I was an
exchange student from Iceland.

409
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:18,614
Point is, I get it.

410
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:20,744
I'm shockingly
progressive for a Lorian.

411
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,729
We get married, I'd still
let you speak in public.

412
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,640
I'd make sure that you...
Jesus, I'm not marrying you.

413
00:24:25,664 --> 00:24:27,030
You think I wanna
marry a virgin?

414
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:29,068
This is purely
political. Oh, my God.

415
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:30,831
I'm not a virgin.

416
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:35,641
Look, I've had
the best in Loria,

417
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,509
and Lorians are the best.

418
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:41,244
Hmm. So either way,

419
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:43,075
you're a virgin to
me, sweetheart.

420
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,242
I'm not your sweetheart,

421
00:24:48,921 --> 00:24:51,948
and I'm certain that
I can bang circles

422
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:54,994
around your boring
little Lorian hoes,

423
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,720
'cause I'm a very smart,

424
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:00,555
very liberated woman,

425
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,930
and when I set my
mind to something,

426
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:06,933
I master it.

427
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:10,633
And you've mastered what?

428
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,978
Never touching a man?

429
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:16,941
Not touching, touching...

430
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:20,443
I'm good at both.

431
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,913
Oh... You want me to stop?

432
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:30,122
Say it, or I'll stop.

433
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:32,923
Don't stop.

434
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:35,264
Beg me.

435
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:36,901
I like you.

436
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:42,384
So you waited until now to
tell me about you and Bayler?

437
00:25:42,408 --> 00:25:43,551
I've been trying to tell you.

438
00:25:43,575 --> 00:25:44,753
It's been a little insane today.

439
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:46,421
I'm not trying to keep secrets
from you. That's my point.

440
00:25:46,445 --> 00:25:49,472
Eliot, please understand.

441
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:51,774
I had a life before you came.

442
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:54,376
I had no idea if you
even would come.

443
00:25:54,787 --> 00:25:57,586
Fillory is my home,
and I care about it.

444
00:25:58,524 --> 00:25:59,924
So you became a terrorist?

445
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:01,290
We're not violent.

446
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:04,192
I'd call your ex-boyfriend
trying to strangle me

447
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:05,492
a little bit violent!

448
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:06,725
He's not my...

449
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:09,533
We were close, yes,

450
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:12,264
but hurting people
was never the plan.

451
00:26:12,337 --> 00:26:15,068
I have no idea who
you are. I'm your wife.

452
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,217
Because your father made you.

453
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,401
I could've walked out of here

454
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:18,741
a long time ago.

455
00:26:18,811 --> 00:26:20,040
Then why didn't you?

456
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:22,545
If you hate us so much,
if you hate me so much,

457
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:24,310
why didn't you? Because I don't.

458
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:26,477
I believe in you.
You think I stayed

459
00:26:26,552 --> 00:26:29,613
because you're just so
deeply attracted to me?

460
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:33,125
I am a realist who
wants you to succeed.

461
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:34,717
I want us to.

462
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,095
So what am I supposed to do

463
00:26:40,199 --> 00:26:42,634
with your good friend
in the dungeon, huh?

464
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:43,741
You should keep him there.

465
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:45,236
I don't think you can trust him.

466
00:26:45,304 --> 00:26:46,897
Do you think I can trust you?

467
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:54,540
I was 21.

468
00:26:55,347 --> 00:26:57,339
It didn't seem so
crazy back then to think

469
00:26:57,416 --> 00:27:00,511
I could summon the
goddess, do good.

470
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:02,521
Yeah, that's what I wanted too.

471
00:27:02,588 --> 00:27:04,921
I couldn't get rid
of the baby either.

472
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,219
What?

473
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:09,252
I wasn't the only one
he raped that night,

474
00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:12,298
but I was the only
one who got pregnant.

475
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:13,627
So what did you do?

476
00:27:13,699 --> 00:27:15,497
I tried everything.

477
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:18,002
I even thought
about killing myself,

478
00:27:18,604 --> 00:27:19,914
but I couldn't go
through with it.

479
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:21,338
You had it?

480
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:24,236
I'd rather die.

481
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:32,514
I want to help you, Julia.

482
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:35,782
I can't banish Reynard again,

483
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:37,589
but you can.

484
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,629
Where's your cat? - Oh!

485
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:56,338
He's around here
somewhere. Come on.

486
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:59,677
Follow me.

487
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:11,754
You just wait right here, honey.

488
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:14,354
So sorry about this.

489
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:30,203
Late, Ms. Hanson.

490
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,979
Sit, you have 10 minutes
to complete your midterm.

491
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:35,513
Midterm?

492
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:38,551
But... But I haven't studied.

493
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:42,811
Even I studied, and I'm dead.

494
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:47,421
Forgot your
clothes too? Typical.

495
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,122
Margo? Hey... Whoa!

496
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:55,964
I swear I was gonna study. What?

497
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:59,163
No, no, it's me.
It's actually me.

498
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:00,763
Oh, God.

499
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:02,539
Oh, God, I'm asleep.

500
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:04,543
Uh, yeah, you must not
be in imminent danger

501
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,704
if you're napping,
wherever you are.

502
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:08,804
Kidnapped, along
with the entire castle.

503
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,712
Yeah, I know, there's a
crater. Where are you?

504
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:12,216
Loria.

505
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:15,743
Some canyon with these
purple-ish rock things.

506
00:29:15,821 --> 00:29:17,050
Rock things? What...

507
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:19,717
Dicks, okay? They
look like dicks.

508
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:22,127
Uh, full-sail or half?

509
00:29:22,194 --> 00:29:25,062
Honestly, it's a
variety pack out there.

510
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:28,225
Okay, I got it. I'll find you.

511
00:29:28,567 --> 00:29:32,470
And, Penny, if you ever
tell anyone you saw this...

512
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:35,234
Ooh, oh, no, no, no.
No, I'd never. I, uh...

513
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:37,602
I'd much rather have
you owe me huge.

514
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,530
Scouring the room for a weapon?

515
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:01,795
You have a look in
your eyes, that's all.

516
00:30:01,867 --> 00:30:03,927
It's called resting bitch face.

517
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:16,848
The Cock Barrens of Loria.

518
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:19,680
Okay. Show me where.

519
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:26,688
There. Right there.

520
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:34,022
Look, I know this isn't gonna
make anything any better.

521
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:38,334
I want you to know
that Alice died a hero.

522
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:41,430
It's funny. These
stories we tell.

523
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,737
Hmm?

524
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:45,053
You'd rather break
both of your legs

525
00:30:45,077 --> 00:30:47,273
than have a conversation
with me about this.

526
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:49,781
I can't stand to think about it.

527
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,713
Do me a favor,

528
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:56,084
and get me a tall glass of
whatever looks strongest.

529
00:30:56,722 --> 00:30:58,418
You're on a lot of painkillers.

530
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:01,050
My daughter is dead.

531
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:19,077
Let me guess... God!

532
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:20,776
My husband said

533
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:23,975
don't bother me, because
I'm too crazy right now.

534
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:28,648
Come on.

535
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,650
We gonna finish this or what?

536
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,251
Yeah.

537
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:52,171
What... What is...

538
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,210
What is that?

539
00:31:56,715 --> 00:31:57,978
Don't be scared.

540
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,184
I don't know what you
want from me, okay?

541
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:06,156
Okay. I want you to start
by understanding something,

542
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:08,591
and I don't expect you
to like the idea of this,

543
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:10,952
but you're going
to have that baby.

544
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:12,224
What?

545
00:32:12,364 --> 00:32:14,265
What the... That is insane.

546
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:16,130
Believe me, I know,

547
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:19,562
but that little demigod
growing inside of you

548
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:22,073
is like a tiny nuclear reactor.

549
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:27,044
You have one chance to harness
that power when you give birth.

550
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:28,410
Then I don't want that power.

551
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,675
Yes, you do,

552
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:31,683
because that's how
I banished Reynard,

553
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,446
and that's how you'll do it too,

554
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:35,749
while in labor with his child.

555
00:32:35,821 --> 00:32:37,084
No!

556
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:40,725
Not your choice anymore.

557
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:53,027
Thank you.

558
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:56,268
Kady, they may be able to
help your friend with her problem,

559
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:58,936
but listen, I would never
ever do business with them

560
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,672
if I had a choice.

561
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:03,945
Be careful with people
like this, <i>Maminka.</i>

562
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:06,484
You don't want to wind
up like your mother.

563
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:10,185
Thanks.

564
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,322
<i>This is Julia. Leave a message.</i>

565
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:22,560
Shit.

566
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,934
This place is warded up the ass.

567
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,618
Shit.

568
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:54,865
Um...

569
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:57,992
Thank you?

570
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:01,399
You're trapped
here too, aren't you?

571
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:27,898
So...

572
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:31,296
If I had this baby,
would it be like...

573
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:35,433
That's not my baby.

574
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,436
That's my Haxenpaxen.

575
00:34:37,676 --> 00:34:38,676
What?

576
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,736
My Haxenpaxen. I caught it.

577
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:44,578
Smells unfortunate,
but just imagine

578
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:46,675
what it's giving off magically.

579
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:48,879
Not even a
trickster can find us.

580
00:34:48,954 --> 00:34:51,583
We're invisible
while we're near him.

581
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:55,787
Do have to occasionally stock
up on food and kitty litter, though.

582
00:34:56,795 --> 00:35:00,095
How you found me, I suppose.

583
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:01,827
So if that's not your child...

584
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,232
My child is safe.

585
00:35:04,002 --> 00:35:06,028
He'll never know
who he really is.

586
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:09,666
He doesn't even know
who I am. I made sure of it.

587
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:11,403
It's for the best.

588
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:13,570
He's a good man, Julia.

589
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:16,607
An influential man.

590
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:52,509
Kady!

591
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:56,281
Your magic is no good here.

592
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:00,751
What?

593
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:05,891
Oh, God, what's with
Stink-master Flash?

594
00:36:05,964 --> 00:36:08,524
Free him too. He's
coming with us.

595
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,937
Must've been some negotiation.

596
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,935
Say I did marry him...

597
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,741
Say I... Stop,
forget what I said.

598
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:26,979
This whole marriage
thing is absurd.

599
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:31,385
You have no idea
who the other person is.

600
00:36:31,456 --> 00:36:34,153
It's dangerous. If it's
that bad, have her killed.

601
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:35,853
I can't.

602
00:36:35,927 --> 00:36:38,089
We just made a human together.

603
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:40,992
And the worst is, between
the whole lying back

604
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:43,558
and thinking of Fillory,

605
00:36:43,635 --> 00:36:46,161
I started to actually like her.

606
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,597
El, what's going on?

607
00:36:50,341 --> 00:36:52,936
One life-altering
crisis at a time.

608
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:55,413
What do you wanna
do about the princess?

609
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,108
It's your choice.

610
00:36:57,182 --> 00:36:59,117
I just want what's best for you.

611
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:05,918
Hey!

612
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:09,759
I went to the exact spot.
No castle, nothing there.

613
00:37:09,828 --> 00:37:10,905
It has to be some other dongs.

614
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:12,022
There are no more dongs.

615
00:37:12,097 --> 00:37:14,225
That's the only spot
the castle could be.

616
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,527
Yeah, well, it doesn't
make any sense unless...

617
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,504
God, please don't let
me be wrong about this.

618
00:37:30,181 --> 00:37:31,911
You guys have been
so royally fucked with.

619
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,780
You won't believe where
you've been this whole time.

620
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:37,845
Okay.

621
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:42,160
Now you only get one shot, okay?

622
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:45,295
So, remember, you
have to tell the truth.

623
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:47,657
I've got this, Quentin.

624
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,829
Relax. Okay.

625
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:57,568
Alice...

626
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:01,311
She needed a strong
female role model.

627
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:05,144
She was so lucky
to have me for that.

628
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:08,986
You have to tell the truth.

629
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:11,045
But that is the truth.

630
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:15,751
Alice was complicated.

631
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:17,819
She never figured out
how to be a woman.

632
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:20,024
That's not the
truth, not for Alice.

633
00:38:20,098 --> 00:38:24,934
Don't be ridiculous. This is
just Alice up to her usual tricks.

634
00:38:25,003 --> 00:38:26,904
She was always so hard on me.

635
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,337
This is not about you.

636
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:29,931
Will you just for
once in your life

637
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:32,034
put yourself in your
daughter's shoes?

638
00:38:32,544 --> 00:38:34,877
What do you want me to say?

639
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:41,412
That I never understood her?

640
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:47,657
And that I never really tried?

641
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:54,958
I didn't know having a
daughter would be this hard.

642
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:59,260
I resented her sometimes. I...

643
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,836
I just need a minute. No.

644
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:06,468
No.

645
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:09,241
Come on, we've gotta
finish it. Stephanie!

646
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:13,050
Ugh.

647
00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:21,554
Idiot.

648
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,698
I cast a Niffin summoning
and you didn't come.

649
00:39:30,635 --> 00:39:32,160
How? Why?

650
00:39:32,237 --> 00:39:33,603
You're wrong.

651
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:35,196
I was right there.

652
00:39:36,808 --> 00:39:38,333
Oh, Quentin.

653
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:41,443
We're gonna have so much fun,

654
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:43,640
just like we did
with my parents.

655
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:45,949
Hmm.

656
00:39:46,651 --> 00:39:49,917
I killed you. My cacodemon...

657
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:52,981
Your cacodemon wasn't
powerful enough to kill me.

658
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:56,260
It tried, but when it
saw that it couldn't win...

659
00:39:56,327 --> 00:40:00,458
Well, let's just say it stuffed
me in a place most convenient.

660
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:03,365
That stupid tattoo
trap on your back.

661
00:40:05,303 --> 00:40:07,397
We're stuck with each other.

662
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,840
Oh...

663
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:12,367
Oh, God.

664
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:20,943
No, no, no.

665
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:35,895
Oh, God.

666
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:37,868
Too slow. Sorry.

667
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:42,405
Dana. In the flesh.

668
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:44,070
I'd heard you were dead.

669
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:46,270
You hid well. I'm impressed.

670
00:40:46,344 --> 00:40:49,109
What happened? You slipped up.

671
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:56,120
I think you have
some apologizing to do.

672
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,817
Don't you?

673
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,829
I have reached my decision.

674
00:41:11,903 --> 00:41:16,398
I will marry the Prince
of Loria, on one condition.

675
00:41:16,741 --> 00:41:20,371
I want a tour of his
kingdom right now.

676
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,748
Wedding first, then a tour.

677
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:34,959
Last tree, and done.

678
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:40,256
Oh, no.

679
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:43,835
No, no, no.

680
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:46,600
This is the worst
day of my life.

681
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:49,363
I know, right?
Crazy illusion magic.

682
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:51,835
So, hey, what do you
think about making that...

683
00:41:54,479 --> 00:41:55,640
Map.

684
00:41:57,048 --> 00:41:58,209
You drew it for me.

685
00:41:58,282 --> 00:41:59,375
Yes.

686
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,009
I made an exception.

687
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:04,755
Thank you.

688
00:42:07,592 --> 00:42:09,151
You're still bat
shit crazy, man.

689
00:42:09,227 --> 00:42:10,388
I heard that.

690
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:13,687
Margo, please.

691
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,765
You fucked with us.

692
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:17,131
Mmm-hmm. Yes, you did.

693
00:42:17,402 --> 00:42:18,836
You fucked with our castle.

694
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:20,269
Amen, sister.

695
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:22,534
And now we're gonna
put our Jimmy Choos

696
00:42:22,607 --> 00:42:25,941
so far up your ass, you're
gonna taste next season.

697
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:28,639
Exactly, whatever that means.

698
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:34,512
Because the High King and I hereby
declare war on the Kingdom of Loria!

699
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:35,813
Yes!

700
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:38,387
Wait...

701
00:42:40,425 --> 00:42:41,586
Really?
