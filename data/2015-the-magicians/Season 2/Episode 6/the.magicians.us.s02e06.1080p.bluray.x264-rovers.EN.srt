1
00:00:01,058 --> 00:00:03,178
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:04,915
Alice, whose house is this exactly?

3
00:00:05,035 --> 00:00:07,569
- Alice?
- Hi, Dad.

4
00:00:07,604 --> 00:00:10,972
- You know how I feel about Mom.
- Fine. Stephanie.

5
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,552
Ugh, I just feel like
I'm being pulled back

6
00:00:12,576 --> 00:00:15,110
into this version of me
when I was, like, 12

7
00:00:15,145 --> 00:00:17,546
and furious and invisible and mute.

8
00:00:17,581 --> 00:00:19,147
You cure your own hands just fine,

9
00:00:19,183 --> 00:00:21,149
but mine, you can't do
a fucking thing about, huh?

10
00:00:21,185 --> 00:00:22,984
There are other options.

11
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:25,454
You can travel to Fillory.

12
00:00:25,489 --> 00:00:28,156
Go there, get this.

13
00:00:28,192 --> 00:00:29,524
I'll do what I can.

14
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,494
You may address me as Reynard the Fox.

15
00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:34,329
Reynard is targeting hedges.

16
00:00:34,364 --> 00:00:36,298
There was a girl. Forty years ago,

17
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:39,034
she banished Reynard from Earth.

18
00:00:39,069 --> 00:00:41,870
I still don't know what I'm looking for.

19
00:00:41,905 --> 00:00:45,941
Any sort of strange event or aberration.

20
00:00:47,578 --> 00:00:50,278
- The test was positive.
- Fuck!

21
00:00:50,314 --> 00:00:51,513
Yeah, so let's just get

22
00:00:51,548 --> 00:00:53,648
this pesky abortion out of the way.

23
00:00:53,684 --> 00:00:54,684
Kady!

24
00:00:56,653 --> 00:01:00,055
I'm Bayler, a proud soldier
of Fillorians United.

25
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,456
I'm not a Fu Fighter anymore.

26
00:01:01,492 --> 00:01:03,391
Help us, or I go to your king,

27
00:01:03,427 --> 00:01:06,128
and tell him exactly
how well I know his wife.

28
00:01:06,163 --> 00:01:07,763
Then I'll tell him myself.

29
00:01:07,798 --> 00:01:09,231
What is she doing?

30
00:01:09,266 --> 00:01:10,932
She can't. She'll niffin out.

31
00:01:14,004 --> 00:01:16,171
Your turn.

32
00:01:16,206 --> 00:01:18,940
- Quentin says go free.
- Alice!

33
00:01:44,968 --> 00:01:48,904
Um...

34
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:51,239
Remind me again
what summoning Alice's niffin

35
00:01:51,275 --> 00:01:53,875
has to do with the...

36
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:56,845
tai chi... I mean, ballet.

37
00:02:00,017 --> 00:02:01,950
Ooh.

38
00:02:01,985 --> 00:02:04,052
God, he should never do that move again.

39
00:02:04,087 --> 00:02:06,555
It's niffin bait.
You have to call to them

40
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,256
at their point of their transformation

41
00:02:08,292 --> 00:02:09,491
with something personal.

42
00:02:09,526 --> 00:02:11,793
Oh... It's a sex thing.

43
00:02:11,829 --> 00:02:14,796
No, it's Cirque Du Soleil.
You know Cirque Du Soleil?

44
00:02:14,832 --> 00:02:17,032
You and Alice had sex
to Cirque Du Soleil?

45
00:02:17,067 --> 00:02:18,907
No, it was something
I would do to cheer her up

46
00:02:18,936 --> 00:02:20,702
when she was sad. It made her laugh.

47
00:02:20,737 --> 00:02:22,237
Ugh.

48
00:02:22,272 --> 00:02:23,872
That just made my heart hurt a little.

49
00:02:23,907 --> 00:02:26,908
- Shut up.
- I was being sincere.

50
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,143
Does he have the box?

51
00:02:28,178 --> 00:02:29,811
I mean, what if this actually works?

52
00:02:29,847 --> 00:02:33,548
Yes, but be warned, he wants
to try to reason with her.

53
00:02:33,584 --> 00:02:35,884
She was working on
some sort of reversal spell.

54
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:38,386
He thinks he can somehow finish it.

55
00:02:38,422 --> 00:02:40,822
He's convinced she wants him to.

56
00:02:40,858 --> 00:02:41,890
Oh, Jesus.

57
00:02:41,925 --> 00:02:44,326
Okay, I'm starting over.

58
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:45,894
No, Q, stop.

59
00:02:45,929 --> 00:02:49,397
If Alice was still a niffin...
if she was still here...

60
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:51,533
You've been at this an hour.

61
00:02:51,568 --> 00:02:55,537
You can't summon her,
because she's gone.

62
00:02:55,572 --> 00:02:58,073
It's just I saw her... it felt so real.

63
00:02:58,108 --> 00:03:00,342
Why don't we get you
back to the castle, huh?

64
00:03:00,377 --> 00:03:02,644
Some rest, some food.

65
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:05,213
And hey, there's an entire
kingdom's-worth

66
00:03:05,249 --> 00:03:07,983
of problems to distract you.

67
00:03:08,018 --> 00:03:11,686
We really are beset,
and could use your help.

68
00:03:11,722 --> 00:03:14,389
- I hear you, I'm just...
- Good, vamanos.

69
00:03:14,424 --> 00:03:16,791
Her memorial is tomorrow.

70
00:03:16,827 --> 00:03:19,594
I should go and look
her parents in the eye...

71
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,365
tell them how she died.

72
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,501
And then...

73
00:03:26,536 --> 00:03:28,169
I'll come back to Fillory,

74
00:03:28,205 --> 00:03:31,606
and I'll be a king. I promise.

75
00:03:31,642 --> 00:03:33,808
Can I trust you with this?
No offense, Q,

76
00:03:33,844 --> 00:03:36,144
you're a little crazy right now.

77
00:03:36,179 --> 00:03:38,647
Maybe, but yeah.

78
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:07,442
Ah, the sacrifice.

79
00:04:07,477 --> 00:04:09,377
Uh, the plinth is in the backyard.

80
00:04:09,413 --> 00:04:11,846
Follow me. Just, uh, watch the rug.

81
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:16,117
Daniel...

82
00:04:16,153 --> 00:04:19,321
reconfigured the entire house,
and still...

83
00:04:19,356 --> 00:04:24,726
everywhere I look, I see
something that Alice touched.

84
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:27,662
My children loved me.

85
00:04:27,698 --> 00:04:31,032
- I was a good mother.
- You were, Stephanie, you were.

86
00:04:31,068 --> 00:04:33,668
- So much better than my mother.
- Of cour...

87
00:04:33,704 --> 00:04:35,837
What have I done to deserve this?

88
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,154
Um, hi.

89
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,527
Alice?

90
00:05:01,298 --> 00:05:05,533
Alice...

91
00:05:05,569 --> 00:05:07,168
Are you really there?

92
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,377
Okay.

93
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,525
You're kind of freaking me out.

94
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,428
I mean, I love you, but you're
very ghost-like right now, so...

95
00:05:37,134 --> 00:05:39,467
Okay.

96
00:05:43,306 --> 00:05:45,440
I can't.

97
00:05:49,513 --> 00:05:51,513
Okay.

98
00:05:51,548 --> 00:05:55,383
Okay, okay...

99
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,954
No.

100
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:03,691
Eliot and Margo are right. You're...

101
00:06:03,727 --> 00:06:06,895
she's gone, and you're a little crazy.

102
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,386
Or not.

103
00:06:55,712 --> 00:06:57,745
Alice.

104
00:07:11,328 --> 00:07:13,628
Just don't jump out at me, okay?

105
00:07:26,343 --> 00:07:28,409
Quentin?

106
00:07:28,445 --> 00:07:29,744
Is that you?

107
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:32,580
Uh, sorry, Mr. Q... or Daniel. Sorry.

108
00:07:32,615 --> 00:07:33,948
Give me a hug.

109
00:07:39,055 --> 00:07:42,023
How on earth did you get into
my private study?

110
00:07:42,058 --> 00:07:44,258
Uh...

111
00:07:44,294 --> 00:07:46,394
There's, um, something going on.

112
00:07:52,369 --> 00:07:54,469
Yeah.

113
00:07:54,504 --> 00:07:55,837
Yeah, got it.

114
00:07:55,872 --> 00:07:56,882
Tell them I'm Hannah's daughter,

115
00:07:56,906 --> 00:08:00,007
and this is an emergency.

116
00:08:00,043 --> 00:08:04,345
Can you just tell her
to call me, please?

117
00:08:04,381 --> 00:08:06,314
- Hey.
- Hey.

118
00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:09,317
Uh, I mixed up your dose.
It's on the counter.

119
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,724
To all the heroine I am not taking.

120
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,059
Cheers.

121
00:08:20,063 --> 00:08:21,729
- Mm.
- Did you get the pickles?

122
00:08:21,765 --> 00:08:22,864
Yep.

123
00:08:28,004 --> 00:08:31,572
You found something.

124
00:08:31,608 --> 00:08:34,409
August 19th, 1976, 7:00 a.m.

125
00:08:34,444 --> 00:08:35,988
An unseasonal hailstorm
hit the Northeast.

126
00:08:36,012 --> 00:08:37,345
Nothing too crazy, right?

127
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,548
An hour later,
a tidal wave slammed into Miami.

128
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,617
Hour after that, hurricanes
struck both the coasts

129
00:08:42,652 --> 00:08:44,218
of Peru, Chile.

130
00:08:44,254 --> 00:08:46,487
I mean, something rippled down
the entire hemisphere,

131
00:08:46,523 --> 00:08:51,526
and if you follow the chain
reaction back to its source...

132
00:08:51,561 --> 00:08:54,095
Hoboken, New Jersey?

133
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,063
Nothing ever starts
in Hoboken, New Jersey.

134
00:08:56,099 --> 00:08:59,434
Well, on August 19th,
some time before dawn,

135
00:08:59,469 --> 00:09:01,102
this happened.

136
00:09:01,137 --> 00:09:03,104
Industrial park burned to the ground.

137
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:04,972
No one could explain
what caused the fire,

138
00:09:05,008 --> 00:09:08,676
or why it left one single
building standing untouched

139
00:09:08,711 --> 00:09:11,612
with a perfect circle of burn around it.

140
00:09:16,419 --> 00:09:17,685
Thank you.

141
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,821
Mm. Mm-hmm.

142
00:09:19,856 --> 00:09:20,988
Next.

143
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,438
- Eliot, I need to talk to you.
- Oh, thank you.

144
00:09:25,462 --> 00:09:29,063
It's about that Fu Fighter
in the dungeon.

145
00:09:29,098 --> 00:09:32,300
What the actual
all-encompassing fuck is this?

146
00:09:32,335 --> 00:09:34,168
Your majesty, you said you wanted

147
00:09:34,204 --> 00:09:37,038
- a unicorn milk latte.
- I was joking.

148
00:09:37,073 --> 00:09:38,973
Wait, you milked a unicorn?

149
00:09:41,044 --> 00:09:44,879
So listen, about Bayler...

150
00:09:44,914 --> 00:09:48,691
Holy shit,
the walking plot twist returns.

151
00:09:48,726 --> 00:09:50,860
- Hi, I need something.
- Shocker.

152
00:09:50,895 --> 00:09:53,930
Hey, Fen, look who it is. Uncy Penny.

153
00:09:53,965 --> 00:09:56,899
That's right, I knocked her up.
No big deal.

154
00:09:56,935 --> 00:09:58,534
Uh, congratulations?

155
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,247
Like I needed more people
calling me daddy,

156
00:10:00,271 --> 00:10:03,673
but yes, thanks. We're thrilled.

157
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:04,907
Uh...

158
00:10:04,943 --> 00:10:07,210
Fen, um, could you give us

159
00:10:07,245 --> 00:10:10,379
just like one moment, please?

160
00:10:14,085 --> 00:10:17,553
- Yeah, so I'm here...
- I heard...

161
00:10:17,589 --> 00:10:20,957
you heard...

162
00:10:20,992 --> 00:10:22,892
Alice. I know you two were close.

163
00:10:22,927 --> 00:10:24,493
Please shut up.

164
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:26,529
I am trying to ask if you are okay.

165
00:10:26,564 --> 00:10:27,697
Are you okay?

166
00:10:29,767 --> 00:10:31,634
Okay. I need to know

167
00:10:31,669 --> 00:10:34,837
where your Dicranium
Scoparium Majorus grows.

168
00:10:34,873 --> 00:10:38,107
Are you having a seizure?

169
00:10:38,142 --> 00:10:40,142
Moss? Why?

170
00:10:40,178 --> 00:10:41,277
Fix my hands.

171
00:10:41,312 --> 00:10:42,656
You got a royal botanist or something?

172
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,347
Oh, well, um, we did,

173
00:10:44,382 --> 00:10:47,250
but apparently he sort of
got eaten on the job.

174
00:10:47,285 --> 00:10:49,986
By what? A... a plant?

175
00:10:53,858 --> 00:10:56,792
I hate this place.

176
00:10:56,828 --> 00:11:00,363
Try the royal map-maker.

177
00:11:00,398 --> 00:11:02,398
Love ya.

178
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:07,036
So she's only shown herself
to me that I know of.

179
00:11:07,071 --> 00:11:08,415
I don't know. Maybe I'm tuned into

180
00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:12,141
her ghost channel or something, or...

181
00:11:12,176 --> 00:11:13,587
maybe it has something to do with this.

182
00:11:13,611 --> 00:11:14,911
I don't know.

183
00:11:14,946 --> 00:11:17,246
- I believe you.
- You do?

184
00:11:17,282 --> 00:11:19,382
I know my daughter.
She's trying to protect us.

185
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:21,517
Seeing her like that would be...

186
00:11:21,552 --> 00:11:24,320
very upsetting for her mother and me,

187
00:11:24,355 --> 00:11:26,989
but she led you to this for a reason.

188
00:11:27,025 --> 00:11:28,891
Uh, Alice called a couple of months ago

189
00:11:28,927 --> 00:11:32,628
about some ghost children
trapped in an estate in England.

190
00:11:32,664 --> 00:11:35,164
- The Plover estate.
- Yes, yes, that's the one.

191
00:11:35,199 --> 00:11:37,366
I was delighted to help.
Got a hold of this,

192
00:11:37,402 --> 00:11:40,469
planned to give it to her
when she had the time to visit,

193
00:11:40,505 --> 00:11:42,438
but then...

194
00:11:45,543 --> 00:11:48,678
Well, anyway, you see the ancients had

195
00:11:48,713 --> 00:11:53,482
many ways of dealing with ghosts
out of necessity back then.

196
00:11:53,518 --> 00:11:56,986
Alice's Ka, her soul,

197
00:11:57,021 --> 00:11:58,754
is not at rest, but it can be.

198
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:03,559
Now, one ancient civilization
that really mastered

199
00:12:03,594 --> 00:12:07,229
the whole getting-one's-
soul-to-rest thing...

200
00:12:07,265 --> 00:12:09,966
The Egyptians.

201
00:12:10,001 --> 00:12:13,769
Wait, are you seeing that
Alice wants us to build...

202
00:12:13,805 --> 00:12:15,972
Ecce.

203
00:12:16,007 --> 00:12:18,140
In pyramis.

204
00:12:20,611 --> 00:12:22,311
Oh, my God.

205
00:12:22,347 --> 00:12:23,512
What's going on?

206
00:12:23,548 --> 00:12:25,881
Just another day in the office?

207
00:12:31,956 --> 00:12:34,924
Your majesties,
the much-venerated Emissaries

208
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,559
of our neighbors to the north.

209
00:12:36,594 --> 00:12:40,663
I present Prince Ess of Loria.

210
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,100
I'm sorry...

211
00:12:44,135 --> 00:12:46,002
Princess?

212
00:12:46,037 --> 00:12:48,671
Please, call me Ess.

213
00:12:48,706 --> 00:12:50,439
Prince Ess.

214
00:12:50,475 --> 00:12:54,176
Oh, my God. Fuck your parents, dude.

215
00:12:54,212 --> 00:12:55,344
We got a problem.

216
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,523
You guys have been fucking shit up

217
00:12:56,547 --> 00:12:58,314
- for over half a century.
- Okay.

218
00:12:58,349 --> 00:13:00,049
- This is how Lorians talk?
- And look...

219
00:13:00,084 --> 00:13:01,517
The Prince speaks fluent Earth.

220
00:13:01,552 --> 00:13:06,522
Rumor has it his mother is from,
uh, Cincinn-ah-ti.

221
00:13:06,557 --> 00:13:08,758
Until The Beast drained the Wellspring.

222
00:13:08,793 --> 00:13:11,627
And then... oh, yeah...

223
00:13:11,662 --> 00:13:13,229
you jokers let Ember take a dump...

224
00:13:13,264 --> 00:13:15,531
Get to your point.

225
00:13:15,566 --> 00:13:17,867
Loria depends on
the Wellspring's tributaries,

226
00:13:17,902 --> 00:13:19,769
but now their magic's jacked.
Not enough.

227
00:13:19,804 --> 00:13:23,272
Crops, rivers,
entire species are affected.

228
00:13:23,307 --> 00:13:24,640
- You dicked us over.
- No.

229
00:13:24,675 --> 00:13:26,642
We're trying to fix it, so...

230
00:13:26,677 --> 00:13:28,477
Great, then this should be easy.

231
00:13:28,513 --> 00:13:31,414
I'm here to propose a treaty
between our two kingdoms.

232
00:13:31,449 --> 00:13:34,150
A 50/50 split of the Wellspring.

233
00:13:34,185 --> 00:13:35,751
And to seal the alliance,

234
00:13:35,787 --> 00:13:40,289
I, Crown Prince of Loria,
offer my hand in marriage

235
00:13:40,324 --> 00:13:44,393
to the Virgin Queen Margo.

236
00:13:44,429 --> 00:13:46,929
Um... okay.

237
00:13:46,964 --> 00:13:50,533
- Did he just call me a virgin?
- Bambi, please, let me.

238
00:13:50,568 --> 00:13:53,436
Ess, thank you.

239
00:13:53,471 --> 00:13:56,038
We will consider your generous offer.

240
00:13:56,074 --> 00:13:58,474
- No, we will not.
- Margo, please.

241
00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:02,111
Listen, Princess, I'm not a sharer,

242
00:14:02,146 --> 00:14:05,614
so why don't you walk yourself
and your un-ironic furs

243
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,944
out of my castle?

244
00:14:08,686 --> 00:14:10,119
All right then.

245
00:14:10,154 --> 00:14:14,356
Plan B. Ilario!

246
00:14:14,392 --> 00:14:17,193
- Seriously? A wand?
- Guards!

247
00:14:21,365 --> 00:14:23,043
Listen, I'm friends with
the High King, okay?

248
00:14:23,067 --> 00:14:24,745
I'll make it worth your while
if you just show me

249
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:27,603
- where the goddamn moss grows.
- I told you,

250
00:14:27,638 --> 00:14:29,305
I'll draw your map for you next Thurs...

251
00:14:34,912 --> 00:14:36,779
Shit.

252
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:47,123
Oh, this is bad.

253
00:14:47,158 --> 00:14:49,425
This is very bad.

254
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,730
Are you fucking kidding me?

255
00:14:53,765 --> 00:14:55,309
Do you understand
that castle's full of people?

256
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,311
Do you understand there isn't
a single accurate map

257
00:14:57,335 --> 00:14:59,002
of this entire place now?

258
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:06,876
What the...

259
00:15:06,912 --> 00:15:10,246
Shit is radioactive.

260
00:15:10,282 --> 00:15:14,183
Your majesties, welcome to Loria.

261
00:15:26,164 --> 00:15:28,097
You kidnapped our castle?

262
00:15:28,133 --> 00:15:29,632
I'll put it back,

263
00:15:29,668 --> 00:15:32,268
as soon as you come around to my offer.

264
00:15:32,304 --> 00:15:33,570
So many hostages.

265
00:15:33,605 --> 00:15:36,239
I wouldn't try anything if I were you.

266
00:15:36,274 --> 00:15:38,708
Guards? Dungeon.

267
00:15:38,743 --> 00:15:43,012
The rest of you, hang here.

268
00:15:43,048 --> 00:15:45,248
Shit.

269
00:15:45,283 --> 00:15:46,749
- Shit.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

270
00:15:46,785 --> 00:15:48,685
I'll jump in the doppel-banger,

271
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,787
- and I'll find someone who can...
- What?

272
00:15:50,822 --> 00:15:52,522
- Travel here and help?
- Yes.

273
00:15:52,557 --> 00:15:55,391
Q took the button to
some godforsaken 'burb.

274
00:15:55,427 --> 00:15:57,527
No, you're not leaving me in a castle

275
00:15:57,562 --> 00:15:58,639
full of barbarian frat bros.

276
00:15:58,663 --> 00:15:59,896
Okay, fine,

277
00:15:59,931 --> 00:16:01,464
but while we're talking about them,

278
00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:02,910
you could've been a little diplomatic.

279
00:16:02,934 --> 00:16:06,069
By agreeing to marry
a complete stranger on the spot?

280
00:16:06,104 --> 00:16:07,704
I did it.

281
00:16:07,739 --> 00:16:09,906
That was different.

282
00:16:09,941 --> 00:16:11,975
You're right, this would only
really be equivalent

283
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:15,211
if Ess was a girl,
and you found pussy, you know,

284
00:16:15,246 --> 00:16:18,081
interesting in a sometimes-
you-like-Thai-food kinda way,

285
00:16:18,116 --> 00:16:21,351
and now it's all Thai food
forever till you die.

286
00:16:21,386 --> 00:16:23,686
No, he's a man,

287
00:16:23,722 --> 00:16:25,922
who seems arrogant and entitled

288
00:16:25,957 --> 00:16:27,991
and unclear on the concept of consent.

289
00:16:28,026 --> 00:16:31,894
I can't imagine
what could possibly go wrong.

290
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:34,831
Look, I'm not saying do it. It's just...

291
00:16:34,866 --> 00:16:37,567
You're a queen. I'm a king.

292
00:16:37,602 --> 00:16:39,402
We don't necessarily marry for love.

293
00:16:39,437 --> 00:16:42,238
It's part of the job.

294
00:16:42,273 --> 00:16:44,173
Fine, I'll talk to him,

295
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:48,611
but only to negotiate us
out of this epic clusterfuck.

296
00:16:48,647 --> 00:16:51,648
I'm staying a virgin.

297
00:16:53,652 --> 00:16:55,351
40 years ago, everything burned down

298
00:16:55,387 --> 00:16:58,821
except this building.

299
00:16:58,857 --> 00:17:00,189
Wait a minute.

300
00:17:00,225 --> 00:17:02,025
Here.

301
00:17:12,437 --> 00:17:13,770
Okay.

302
00:17:17,108 --> 00:17:19,942
No way is this sigil 40 years old.

303
00:17:19,978 --> 00:17:22,412
I mean, hardly anything
stays hot that long.

304
00:17:22,447 --> 00:17:24,747
Yeah, except blood. Human blood.

305
00:17:24,783 --> 00:17:26,783
And if that's what it is,
it's the DNA of

306
00:17:26,818 --> 00:17:30,286
whoever cast the banishing,
so let's hope, right?

307
00:17:30,321 --> 00:17:31,421
Yeah.

308
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:53,176
- How long does it take?
- It should work right away.

309
00:17:53,211 --> 00:17:54,777
It's been decades.

310
00:17:54,813 --> 00:17:57,547
I mean, whoever did the
banishing could be dead by now.

311
00:17:57,582 --> 00:18:00,183
They're... they're probably dead.

312
00:18:03,722 --> 00:18:06,456
Oh, shit, it's her.

313
00:18:06,491 --> 00:18:08,624
It... it's my mom's contact.

314
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,359
Okay, hey, head home, wait, okay?

315
00:18:10,395 --> 00:18:11,594
I gotta go.

316
00:18:11,629 --> 00:18:13,696
She can help with the baby situation.

317
00:18:13,732 --> 00:18:16,866
Hello?

318
00:18:23,074 --> 00:18:26,576
The "pyramides" of Giza
provide an excellent blueprint...

319
00:18:26,611 --> 00:18:29,212
specifically,
the one Khufu built to house

320
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:33,382
the soul of his son, Kawab,
valiantly slain in battle.

321
00:18:33,418 --> 00:18:35,284
Yes, here.

322
00:18:36,955 --> 00:18:39,021
Quentin, let's, uh...

323
00:18:39,057 --> 00:18:43,159
let's not bring Stephanie
into this just yet.

324
00:18:43,194 --> 00:18:45,228
It's too much for her.

325
00:18:50,135 --> 00:18:53,002
Listen, Daniel, I thought
maybe you'd wanna hear about

326
00:18:53,037 --> 00:18:55,738
- what happened to Alice.
- Uh, no...

327
00:18:55,774 --> 00:18:58,775
A blood relative must coax the spirit

328
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:02,245
with a bit of mirror magic.

329
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,046
Look into the mirror,

330
00:19:04,082 --> 00:19:07,884
paint a True Image of
the deceased with my words.

331
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,788
But first...

332
00:19:17,562 --> 00:19:19,962
Uh, Quentin,

333
00:19:19,998 --> 00:19:22,598
uh, you go up, hang the mirror.

334
00:19:22,634 --> 00:19:27,069
Oh, and... and, uh,
first, uh, memorize this.

335
00:19:27,105 --> 00:19:29,872
- Recite it when you're up there.
- Oh, this looks like Arabic,

336
00:19:29,908 --> 00:19:33,242
- but not...
- Yes, uh, Egyptian Arabic. Eh?

337
00:19:33,278 --> 00:19:34,510
Okay...

338
00:19:34,546 --> 00:19:36,979
Well, my Egyptian Arabic
is a little rusty.

339
00:19:37,015 --> 00:19:39,215
No, you'll... you'll be fine.
Just whatever you do,

340
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,618
don't let the mirror shatter.
I've already enchanted it.

341
00:19:42,654 --> 00:19:46,756
Now, we've only got one shot.

342
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:48,135
Well, then Daniel,
I think that you should do it.

343
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:49,859
- You... you do it.
- No.

344
00:19:49,894 --> 00:19:51,205
I mean, if that's important,
and we only have one shot...

345
00:19:51,229 --> 00:19:55,665
Now Q... Quentin, please, just... you.

346
00:19:58,736 --> 00:20:01,637
Yeah.

347
00:20:01,673 --> 00:20:03,806
Give me a minute with this.

348
00:20:21,292 --> 00:20:23,092
Oh, my God.

349
00:20:23,127 --> 00:20:25,061
There you are.

350
00:20:52,557 --> 00:20:53,789
Who are you?

351
00:20:53,825 --> 00:20:57,393
Why did you follow me?

352
00:20:57,428 --> 00:20:59,128
Hi.

353
00:20:59,163 --> 00:21:02,298
My name is Julia. I need your help.

354
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:05,701
It's Reynard. He's back.

355
00:21:07,672 --> 00:21:10,206
- How?
- I...

356
00:21:10,241 --> 00:21:13,376
Look, it's a long story.
It was a mistake.

357
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,680
- He hurt you too, didn't he?
- Okay, I'm sorry.

358
00:21:17,715 --> 00:21:19,482
I'm... I... I... I cannot help you.

359
00:21:19,517 --> 00:21:22,585
What? Wait, I am pregnant.

360
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,892
- He...
- Don't worry,

361
00:21:29,928 --> 00:21:31,460
the thing will never be born.

362
00:21:31,496 --> 00:21:33,396
I don't care if I have to
jump off a building.

363
00:21:33,431 --> 00:21:35,865
But I cannot let him do this
to another woman.

364
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,466
You banished him once.

365
00:21:37,502 --> 00:21:40,369
All I am asking is for you
to teach me how to do it.

366
00:21:44,909 --> 00:21:47,376
I think you better come inside.

367
00:22:05,413 --> 00:22:07,180
Oh, shit.

368
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:20,859
Well... Alanis Morissette.

369
00:22:20,894 --> 00:22:24,609
- Alice loved that cat.
- Okay, but why...

370
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,980
I've always had
a terrible fear of heights.

371
00:22:27,005 --> 00:22:29,078
One day, Alanis Morissette
got stuck on the roof.

372
00:22:29,113 --> 00:22:31,280
Alice begged me to get her down,
but I couldn't,

373
00:22:31,315 --> 00:22:34,283
and honestly, I... I yelled at her,

374
00:22:34,318 --> 00:22:35,918
because sometimes that is what one does

375
00:22:35,953 --> 00:22:38,825
when one is ashamed. And the cat...

376
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,958
did not end well.

377
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:46,896
I don't know if Alice ever forgave me

378
00:22:46,931 --> 00:22:50,066
for not being brave enough.

379
00:22:52,303 --> 00:22:54,603
Maybe she will now.

380
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:56,939
No, Daniel, you don't have to do that.

381
00:22:56,974 --> 00:22:58,841
Look, I can do it.

382
00:22:58,876 --> 00:23:01,577
No, I can do it.

383
00:23:01,612 --> 00:23:03,712
For Alice.

384
00:23:16,894 --> 00:23:18,828
Voila. Oh...

385
00:23:18,863 --> 00:23:19,929
Whoa.

386
00:23:19,964 --> 00:23:21,730
Daniel.

387
00:23:25,169 --> 00:23:26,936
Yeah, right?

388
00:23:26,971 --> 00:23:29,338
- And then they came across.
- Whoo.

389
00:23:29,373 --> 00:23:32,308
Hey!

390
00:23:32,343 --> 00:23:35,277
Are you kidding me?

391
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:39,248
Rhaffat jaras. Jaras!

392
00:23:42,453 --> 00:23:46,355
So... when's the wedding?

393
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:49,125
If we forgo the marriage,

394
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,694
I'm willing to grant you periodic access

395
00:23:51,729 --> 00:23:52,729
to the Wellspring...

396
00:23:52,763 --> 00:23:54,964
You think this is a negotiation?

397
00:23:54,999 --> 00:23:58,734
No marriage, no treaty...

398
00:23:58,769 --> 00:24:00,636
no castle back.

399
00:24:00,671 --> 00:24:03,772
Okay, Conan, let me explain to you

400
00:24:03,808 --> 00:24:05,018
how marriage works where I come from.

401
00:24:05,042 --> 00:24:07,409
Oh, spare me. I know.

402
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:09,578
My mother shipped me off
to Exeter when I was 16.

403
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,046
You?

404
00:24:11,082 --> 00:24:13,282
Fancy New England boarding school?

405
00:24:13,317 --> 00:24:14,783
Had a dorm full of future senators

406
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:17,253
convinced I was an exchange
student from Iceland.

407
00:24:17,288 --> 00:24:18,854
Point is I get it.

408
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,390
I'm shockingly progressive for a Lorian.

409
00:24:21,425 --> 00:24:23,692
We get married, I'd still
let you speak in public.

410
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:25,572
- I'd make sure that you...
- Jesus, I'm not marrying you.

411
00:24:25,596 --> 00:24:27,229
You think I wanna marry a virgin?

412
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:29,798
- This is purely political.
- Oh, my God.

413
00:24:29,834 --> 00:24:32,168
I'm not a virgin.

414
00:24:33,604 --> 00:24:36,705
Look, I've had the best in Loria,

415
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:39,775
- and Lorians are the best...
- Hm.

416
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,577
So either way...

417
00:24:41,612 --> 00:24:45,381
you're a virgin to me, sweetheart.

418
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:48,918
I'm not your sweetheart,

419
00:24:48,953 --> 00:24:52,087
and I'm certain that I can bang circles

420
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:55,291
around your boring little Lorian hoes,

421
00:24:55,326 --> 00:24:58,327
'cause I'm a very smart,

422
00:24:58,362 --> 00:25:01,363
very liberated woman,

423
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:05,067
and when I set my mind to something,

424
00:25:05,102 --> 00:25:08,904
I master it.

425
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,840
And you've mastered what?

426
00:25:11,876 --> 00:25:13,943
Never touching a man?

427
00:25:13,978 --> 00:25:17,112
Not touching, touching...

428
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:22,051
I'm good at both.

429
00:25:22,086 --> 00:25:24,687
Oh, you want me to stop?

430
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:32,261
Say it, or I'll stop.

431
00:25:32,296 --> 00:25:34,263
Don't stop.

432
00:25:34,298 --> 00:25:36,599
Beg me.

433
00:25:36,634 --> 00:25:37,766
I like you.

434
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:42,216
So you waited until now
to tell me about you and Bayler?

435
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,651
I've been trying to tell you.
It's been a little insane today.

436
00:25:44,675 --> 00:25:46,253
I'm not trying to keep secrets from you.

437
00:25:46,277 --> 00:25:50,079
That's my point.
Eliot, please understand.

438
00:25:50,114 --> 00:25:52,147
I had a life before you came.

439
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:54,750
I had no idea if you even would come.

440
00:25:54,785 --> 00:25:58,587
Fillory is my home, and I care about it.

441
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:01,423
- So you became a terrorist?
- We're not violent.

442
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:04,293
I'd call your ex-boyfriend
trying to strangle me

443
00:26:04,328 --> 00:26:08,230
- a little bit violent!
- He's not my...

444
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:09,698
We were close, yes,

445
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:12,434
but hurting people was never the plan.

446
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:15,237
- I have no idea who you are.
- I'm your wife.

447
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:17,551
- Because your father made you.
- I could've walked out of here

448
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:20,776
- a long time ago.
- Then why didn't you?

449
00:26:20,811 --> 00:26:22,723
If you hate us so much...
if you hate me so much...

450
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,480
- why didn't you?
- Because I don't.

451
00:26:24,515 --> 00:26:26,649
I believe in you. You think I stayed,

452
00:26:26,684 --> 00:26:29,785
because you're just
so deeply attracted to me?

453
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:33,289
I am a realist who wants you to succeed.

454
00:26:33,324 --> 00:26:34,857
I want us to.

455
00:26:38,396 --> 00:26:40,329
So what am I supposed to do

456
00:26:40,364 --> 00:26:42,765
with your good friend
in the dungeon, huh?

457
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,367
You should keep him there.
I don't think you can trust him.

458
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:47,403
Do you think I can trust you?

459
00:26:53,711 --> 00:26:54,943
I was 21.

460
00:26:54,979 --> 00:26:57,579
It didn't seem so crazy
back then to think

461
00:26:57,615 --> 00:27:00,649
I could summon the goddess, do good.

462
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:02,651
Yeah, that's what I wanted too.

463
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:05,154
I couldn't get rid of the baby either.

464
00:27:05,189 --> 00:27:07,256
What?

465
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:09,558
I wasn't the only one
he raped that night,

466
00:27:09,593 --> 00:27:12,428
but I was the only one who got pregnant.

467
00:27:12,463 --> 00:27:15,597
- So what did you do?
- I tried everything.

468
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:18,500
I even thought about killing myself,

469
00:27:18,536 --> 00:27:20,135
but I couldn't go through with it.

470
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:23,238
You had it?

471
00:27:23,274 --> 00:27:25,007
I'd rather die.

472
00:27:30,314 --> 00:27:32,614
I want to help you, Julia.

473
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:36,352
I can't banish Reynard again...

474
00:27:36,387 --> 00:27:39,521
but you can.

475
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:53,369
Where's your cat?

476
00:27:53,404 --> 00:27:56,071
Oh, he's around here somewhere.

477
00:27:56,107 --> 00:27:58,006
Come on.

478
00:27:58,042 --> 00:27:59,942
Follow me.

479
00:28:10,154 --> 00:28:11,987
You just wait right here, honey.

480
00:28:13,257 --> 00:28:14,690
So sorry about this.

481
00:28:28,501 --> 00:28:31,502
Late, Ms. Hansen.

482
00:28:31,537 --> 00:28:34,008
Sit, you have ten minutes
to complete your midterm.

483
00:28:34,128 --> 00:28:36,573
Midterm?

484
00:28:36,609 --> 00:28:39,903
But... but I haven't studied.

485
00:28:40,165 --> 00:28:44,648
Even I studied, and I'm dead.

486
00:28:44,684 --> 00:28:47,651
Forgot your clothes too? Typical.

487
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:54,258
Margo? Hey... whoa!

488
00:28:54,293 --> 00:28:56,026
- I swear I was gonna study.
- What?

489
00:28:56,062 --> 00:28:58,963
No, no, it's... it's me.
It's actually me.

490
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:00,794
Oh, God.

491
00:29:01,195 --> 00:29:02,594
Oh, God, I'm asleep.

492
00:29:02,629 --> 00:29:04,396
Uh, yeah, you must not be
in imminent danger

493
00:29:04,431 --> 00:29:06,464
if you're napping, wherever you are.

494
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,600
Kidnapped, along with the entire castle.

495
00:29:08,635 --> 00:29:09,875
Yeah, I know, there's a crater.

496
00:29:09,903 --> 00:29:12,237
- Where are you?
- Loria.

497
00:29:12,272 --> 00:29:15,774
Some canyon with these
purple-ish rock things.

498
00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:18,276
- Rock things? What...
- Dicks, okay?

499
00:29:18,312 --> 00:29:20,011
They look like dicks.

500
00:29:20,047 --> 00:29:22,147
Uh, full-sail or half?

501
00:29:22,182 --> 00:29:24,816
Honestly, it's a variety pack out there.

502
00:29:24,852 --> 00:29:28,253
Okay, uh, I got it. I'll find you.

503
00:29:28,288 --> 00:29:32,490
And Penny, if you ever
tell anyone you saw this...

504
00:29:32,526 --> 00:29:34,025
Ooh... oh, no-no-no-no-no, I'd never.

505
00:29:34,061 --> 00:29:38,230
I, uh... I'd much rather
have you owe me huge.

506
00:29:55,515 --> 00:29:58,516
Scouring the room for a weapon?

507
00:29:58,552 --> 00:30:01,786
You have a look in your eyes,
that's all.

508
00:30:01,822 --> 00:30:03,588
It's called resting bitch face.

509
00:30:14,968 --> 00:30:16,935
The Cock Barrens of Loria.

510
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:20,872
Okay. Show me where.

511
00:30:24,978 --> 00:30:27,646
There. Right there.

512
00:30:29,283 --> 00:30:33,618
Look, I know this isn't gonna
make anything any better.

513
00:30:35,923 --> 00:30:38,290
I want you know that Alice died a hero.

514
00:30:38,325 --> 00:30:42,560
It's funny...
these stories we tell, hmm?

515
00:30:43,697 --> 00:30:45,008
You'd rather break both of your legs

516
00:30:45,032 --> 00:30:47,198
than have a conversation
with me about this.

517
00:30:47,234 --> 00:30:51,369
I can't stand to think about it.

518
00:30:51,405 --> 00:30:52,704
Do me a favor,

519
00:30:52,739 --> 00:30:56,574
get me a tall glass of
whatever looks strongest.

520
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:58,343
You're on a lot of painkillers.

521
00:30:58,378 --> 00:31:01,546
My daughter is dead.

522
00:31:16,797 --> 00:31:18,296
Let me guess...

523
00:31:18,332 --> 00:31:20,699
- God.
- My husband said,

524
00:31:20,734 --> 00:31:24,869
"Don't bother me, because
I'm too crazy right now."

525
00:31:27,641 --> 00:31:29,140
Come on.

526
00:31:29,176 --> 00:31:32,110
We gonna finish this or what?

527
00:31:32,145 --> 00:31:34,212
Yeah.

528
00:31:50,364 --> 00:31:53,999
What... what are...

529
00:31:54,034 --> 00:31:56,534
What is that?

530
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:59,404
Don't be scared.

531
00:31:59,439 --> 00:32:01,072
I don't know what you want
from me, okay?

532
00:32:01,108 --> 00:32:05,276
'Kay. I want you to start
by understanding something,

533
00:32:05,312 --> 00:32:09,414
and I... I... I don't expect you
to like the idea of this,

534
00:32:09,449 --> 00:32:10,915
but you're going to have that baby.

535
00:32:10,951 --> 00:32:12,183
What?

536
00:32:12,219 --> 00:32:16,421
- What the... that is insane.
- Believe me, I know,

537
00:32:16,456 --> 00:32:19,357
but that little demigod
growing inside of you

538
00:32:19,393 --> 00:32:21,960
is like a tiny nuclear reactor.

539
00:32:21,995 --> 00:32:25,230
You have one chance
to harness that power

540
00:32:25,265 --> 00:32:26,898
when you give birth.

541
00:32:26,933 --> 00:32:29,534
- Then I don't want that power.
- Yes, you do,

542
00:32:29,569 --> 00:32:31,536
because that's how I banished Reynard,

543
00:32:31,571 --> 00:32:33,304
and that's how you'll do it too,

544
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:36,007
while in labor with his child.

545
00:32:36,043 --> 00:32:39,277
No!

546
00:32:39,312 --> 00:32:42,047
Not your choice anymore.

547
00:32:51,358 --> 00:32:52,891
Thank you.

548
00:32:52,926 --> 00:32:56,127
Kady, they may be able to help
your friend with her problem,

549
00:32:56,163 --> 00:32:59,164
but listen, I would never ever
do business with them

550
00:32:59,199 --> 00:33:00,899
if I had a choice.

551
00:33:00,934 --> 00:33:03,768
Be careful with people
like this, Maminke.

552
00:33:03,804 --> 00:33:06,938
You don't want to wind up
like your mother.

553
00:33:09,076 --> 00:33:10,375
Thanks.

554
00:33:18,819 --> 00:33:21,352
This is Julia. Leave a message.

555
00:33:21,388 --> 00:33:22,388
Shit.

556
00:33:28,615 --> 00:33:30,615
This place is warded up the ass.

557
00:33:42,996 --> 00:33:45,997
Shit.

558
00:33:53,763 --> 00:33:56,973
Um, thank you?

559
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:01,346
You're trapped here too, aren't you?

560
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:31,709
So if... if I had this baby,
would it be like...

561
00:34:31,745 --> 00:34:35,280
That's not my baby.

562
00:34:35,315 --> 00:34:38,283
- That's my Haxenpaxen.
- What?

563
00:34:38,318 --> 00:34:41,352
My Haxenpaxen. I caught it.

564
00:34:41,388 --> 00:34:44,155
Smells unfortunate, but just imagine

565
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:46,291
what it's giving off magically.

566
00:34:46,326 --> 00:34:48,493
Not even a trickster can find us.

567
00:34:48,528 --> 00:34:51,162
We're invisible while we're near him.

568
00:34:51,197 --> 00:34:53,431
Do have to occasionally stock up on food

569
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:56,301
and kitty litter, though.

570
00:34:56,336 --> 00:34:59,671
How you found me, I suppose.

571
00:34:59,706 --> 00:35:03,508
- So if that's not your child...
- My child is safe.

572
00:35:03,543 --> 00:35:05,610
He'll never know who he really is.

573
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:09,247
He doesn't even know who I am.
I made sure of it.

574
00:35:09,282 --> 00:35:10,982
It's for the best.

575
00:35:11,017 --> 00:35:13,985
He's a good man, Julia.

576
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,154
An influential man.

577
00:35:51,091 --> 00:35:52,423
Kady!

578
00:35:54,127 --> 00:35:55,827
Your magic is no good here.

579
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:59,063
Oh!

580
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:00,231
What?

581
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:05,403
Oh, God, what's with Stink-master Flash?

582
00:36:05,438 --> 00:36:08,239
Free him too. He's coming with us.

583
00:36:13,179 --> 00:36:16,280
Must've been some negotiation.

584
00:36:16,316 --> 00:36:18,449
Say I did marry him...

585
00:36:18,485 --> 00:36:22,720
- say I...
- Stop, forget what I said.

586
00:36:22,756 --> 00:36:28,059
This whole marriage thing is absurd.

587
00:36:28,094 --> 00:36:30,895
You have no idea
who the other person is.

588
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:33,064
- It's dangerous.
- If it's that bad,

589
00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:35,500
- have her killed.
- I can't.

590
00:36:35,535 --> 00:36:37,735
We just made a human together.

591
00:36:37,771 --> 00:36:40,471
And the worst is between
the whole lying back

592
00:36:40,507 --> 00:36:43,041
and thinking of Fillory,

593
00:36:43,076 --> 00:36:46,444
I started to actually like her.

594
00:36:46,479 --> 00:36:50,148
El, what's going on?

595
00:36:50,183 --> 00:36:53,217
One life-altering crisis at a time.

596
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:55,219
What do you wanna do about the princess?

597
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:56,954
It's your choice.

598
00:36:56,990 --> 00:36:58,923
I just want what's best for you.

599
00:37:05,131 --> 00:37:06,363
Hey!

600
00:37:06,399 --> 00:37:09,566
I went to the exact spot.
No castle... nothing there.

601
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:12,069
- It has to be some other dongs.
- There are no more dongs.

602
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:14,371
That's the only spot
the castle could be.

603
00:37:14,407 --> 00:37:16,273
Yeah, well, it doesn't make
any sense unless...

604
00:37:25,418 --> 00:37:30,154
God, please don't let me
be wrong about this.

605
00:37:30,189 --> 00:37:32,156
You guys have been so royally fucked with.

606
00:37:32,191 --> 00:37:35,459
You won't believe where
you've been this whole time.

607
00:37:37,496 --> 00:37:40,464
Okay.

608
00:37:40,499 --> 00:37:42,166
Now you only get one shot, okay?

609
00:37:42,201 --> 00:37:46,003
So remember, you have to tell the truth.

610
00:37:46,038 --> 00:37:48,038
I've got this, Quentin.

611
00:37:48,074 --> 00:37:50,340
- Relax.
- Okay.

612
00:37:52,244 --> 00:37:56,647
Oh...

613
00:37:56,682 --> 00:37:58,382
Alice...

614
00:37:58,417 --> 00:38:02,386
she needed a strong female role model.

615
00:38:02,421 --> 00:38:06,990
She was so lucky to have me for that.

616
00:38:07,026 --> 00:38:08,992
You have to tell the truth.

617
00:38:09,028 --> 00:38:12,696
But that is the truth.

618
00:38:12,732 --> 00:38:15,733
Alice was complicated.

619
00:38:15,768 --> 00:38:17,801
She never figured out how to be a woman.

620
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,003
That's not the truth... not for Alice.

621
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:23,040
Don't be ridiculous. This is just Alice

622
00:38:23,075 --> 00:38:24,908
up to her usual tricks.

623
00:38:24,944 --> 00:38:26,877
She was always so hard on me.

624
00:38:26,912 --> 00:38:28,312
This is not about you.

625
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:30,180
Will you just for once in your life

626
00:38:30,216 --> 00:38:32,015
put yourself in your daughter's shoes?

627
00:38:32,051 --> 00:38:36,120
What do you want me to say?

628
00:38:38,457 --> 00:38:41,892
That I never understood her?

629
00:38:45,164 --> 00:38:48,298
And that I never really tried?

630
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:56,640
I didn't know having a daughter
would be this hard.

631
00:38:56,675 --> 00:38:58,909
I resented her sometimes.

632
00:38:58,944 --> 00:39:02,248
I...

633
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:04,483
- I j... I just need a minute.
- No.

634
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,427
- I...
- No.

635
00:39:06,452 --> 00:39:09,150
Come on, we've gotta finish it.
Stephanie!

636
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:13,290
Ugh.

637
00:39:20,334 --> 00:39:21,635
Idiot.

638
00:39:26,705 --> 00:39:29,058
I cast a niffin summoning
and you didn't come.

639
00:39:29,975 --> 00:39:31,541
How? Why?

640
00:39:31,576 --> 00:39:32,976
You're wrong.

641
00:39:33,011 --> 00:39:36,112
I was right there.

642
00:39:36,148 --> 00:39:38,415
Oh, Quentin.

643
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:40,950
We're gonna have so much fun,

644
00:39:40,986 --> 00:39:44,421
just like we did with my parents.

645
00:39:45,991 --> 00:39:49,292
I killed you. My cacodemon...

646
00:39:49,327 --> 00:39:52,362
Your cacodemon wasn't
powerful enough to kill me.

647
00:39:52,397 --> 00:39:55,365
It tried, but when it saw
that it couldn't win...

648
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,569
well, let's just say it stuffed
me in a place most convenient.

649
00:39:59,604 --> 00:40:02,572
That stupid tattoo trap on your back.

650
00:40:04,609 --> 00:40:08,211
We're stuck with each other.

651
00:40:09,815 --> 00:40:11,748
Oh, God.

652
00:40:16,254 --> 00:40:20,890
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

653
00:40:32,637 --> 00:40:35,238
Oh! Oh, God.

654
00:40:35,273 --> 00:40:39,109
Too slow. Sorry.

655
00:40:39,144 --> 00:40:42,212
Dana... in the flesh.

656
00:40:42,247 --> 00:40:43,413
I'd heard you were dead.

657
00:40:43,448 --> 00:40:45,615
You hid well. I'm impressed.

658
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:48,685
What happened? You slipped up.

659
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:56,392
I think you have some apologizing to do.

660
00:40:56,428 --> 00:40:58,928
Don't you?

661
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,141
I have reached my decision.

662
00:41:11,176 --> 00:41:13,877
I will marry the Prince of Loria,

663
00:41:13,912 --> 00:41:16,112
on one condition.

664
00:41:16,148 --> 00:41:19,783
I want a tour of his kingdom right now.

665
00:41:21,453 --> 00:41:23,887
Wedding first, then a tour.

666
00:41:31,296 --> 00:41:34,230
Last tree, and done.

667
00:41:38,703 --> 00:41:40,270
Oh, no.

668
00:41:40,305 --> 00:41:43,306
No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no.

669
00:41:43,341 --> 00:41:46,176
This is the worst day of my life.

670
00:41:46,211 --> 00:41:48,912
I know, right? Crazy illusion magic.

671
00:41:48,947 --> 00:41:53,917
So, hey, what do you think
about making that...

672
00:41:53,952 --> 00:41:56,419
Map.

673
00:41:56,454 --> 00:41:58,888
- You drew it for me.
- Yes.

674
00:41:58,924 --> 00:42:02,792
I made an exception.

675
00:42:02,828 --> 00:42:04,294
Thank you.

676
00:42:06,798 --> 00:42:09,866
- You're still batshit crazy, man.
- I heard that.

677
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:13,770
Margo, please.

678
00:42:13,805 --> 00:42:16,573
- You fucked with us.
- Mm-hmm, yes, he did.

679
00:42:16,608 --> 00:42:19,676
- You fucked with our castle.
- Amen, sister.

680
00:42:19,711 --> 00:42:21,911
And now we're gonna put our Jimmy Choos

681
00:42:21,947 --> 00:42:25,448
so far up your ass,
you're gonna taste next season.

682
00:42:25,483 --> 00:42:28,218
Exactly, whatever that means.

683
00:42:28,253 --> 00:42:30,453
Because the High King and I

684
00:42:30,488 --> 00:42:34,090
hereby declare war
on the kingdom of Loria.

685
00:42:34,125 --> 00:42:36,154
Yes!

686
00:42:36,505 --> 00:42:38,700
Wait...

687
00:42:39,931 --> 00:42:41,097
Really?
