1
00:00:01,229 --> 00:00:02,750
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:02,864 --> 00:00:06,279
The High King and I hereby declare war

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:07,966
on the Kingdom of Loria.

4
00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:11,536
One cannot simply take back
a declaration of war.

5
00:00:11,571 --> 00:00:14,372
My hands can't cast spells anymore.

6
00:00:14,407 --> 00:00:16,741
Help me, I do what I can.

7
00:00:16,776 --> 00:00:18,409
I'm a member of the Order,

8
00:00:18,445 --> 00:00:20,578
the keepers of The Libraries
of the Neitherlands,

9
00:00:20,614 --> 00:00:21,579
the greatest repository of knowledge.

10
00:00:21,615 --> 00:00:23,815
You're a niffin.

11
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,284
Q, I'm not blood-thirsty,
I just want to be free.

12
00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:27,319
Penny!

13
00:00:27,354 --> 00:00:28,720
We're getting you out!

14
00:00:28,755 --> 00:00:30,989
I guess I could help, for a price.

15
00:00:31,024 --> 00:00:32,624
I want to drive.

16
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:34,759
For an hour a day,
I get control of your body.

17
00:00:34,794 --> 00:00:35,927
Fine, it's a deal.

18
00:00:35,962 --> 00:00:37,362
We're gonna make another you.

19
00:00:37,397 --> 00:00:40,431
You sleep here, your mind
goes into the golem.

20
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:44,169
Eliot!

21
00:00:44,204 --> 00:00:45,904
In the center of your being,

22
00:00:45,939 --> 00:00:47,906
there's a tiny beating heart.

23
00:00:47,941 --> 00:00:49,807
It's called "a Shade."

24
00:00:49,843 --> 00:00:51,543
It's what makes you feel.

25
00:00:51,578 --> 00:00:54,245
The pain will burn you
till there's nothing.

26
00:00:54,281 --> 00:00:55,847
It's Reynard, he's back.

27
00:00:55,882 --> 00:00:56,981
He hurt you too, didn't he?

28
00:00:57,017 --> 00:00:58,516
My child is safe.

29
00:00:58,552 --> 00:01:00,685
He'll never know who he really is.

30
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,353
The test was positive.

31
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,490
You will need to find a Mudang.

32
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:07,358
But you can abort it, right?

33
00:01:07,394 --> 00:01:08,927
This is exorcism.

34
00:01:08,962 --> 00:01:11,196
That thing is not human.

35
00:01:11,231 --> 00:01:13,998
Did it work? Is it gone?

36
00:01:14,034 --> 00:01:17,535
But, Julia, there was a complication.

37
00:01:22,642 --> 00:01:24,542
What do you mean, lost her Shade?

38
00:01:24,578 --> 00:01:27,679
When the Mudang
cut the demigod's soul out,

39
00:01:27,714 --> 00:01:32,050
they... they nicked hers by accident.

40
00:01:32,085 --> 00:01:34,552
Her Shade,

41
00:01:34,588 --> 00:01:37,288
it's gone.

42
00:01:37,324 --> 00:01:40,225
Is she gonna be, like...

43
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,627
Honestly, I...

44
00:01:42,662 --> 00:01:44,495
I don't know.

45
00:01:50,604 --> 00:01:53,037
Good morning.

46
00:01:53,073 --> 00:01:54,405
Hey, Jesus,

47
00:01:54,441 --> 00:01:55,974
what day is it?

48
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:57,308
It's Friday.

49
00:01:57,344 --> 00:01:58,810
Are you...

50
00:01:58,845 --> 00:02:01,546
Listen, I just want to thank you

51
00:02:01,581 --> 00:02:03,915
for everything you did to help me.

52
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,018
You're looking at me like I'm crazy.

53
00:02:08,588 --> 00:02:10,321
I mean, are you?

54
00:02:10,357 --> 00:02:12,490
How do you feel?

55
00:02:12,525 --> 00:02:13,925
How do I feel?

56
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,661
I feel light.

57
00:02:16,696 --> 00:02:19,831
Like a million pound weight's
off my chest.

58
00:02:21,701 --> 00:02:22,934
Come.

59
00:02:22,969 --> 00:02:24,769
So what'd you get?

60
00:02:24,804 --> 00:02:26,437
Anything that skins foxes?

61
00:02:26,473 --> 00:02:28,539
Well...

62
00:02:28,575 --> 00:02:30,408
so back in the day,

63
00:02:30,443 --> 00:02:32,443
Zeus and his little frat bros,

64
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:34,946
they ran around kidnapping and raping

65
00:02:34,981 --> 00:02:36,948
with total impunity, so the Magicians,

66
00:02:36,983 --> 00:02:39,784
they read these spells
to protect their communities,

67
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:41,953
God-killing spells.

68
00:02:41,988 --> 00:02:44,856
The one thing that
they all have in common is

69
00:02:44,891 --> 00:02:47,125
they all failed.

70
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,595
Maybe it just can't be done.

71
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,697
You know what? We need to write our own.

72
00:02:52,732 --> 00:02:55,033
We can use these, there's
some pretty big holes, but...

73
00:02:55,068 --> 00:02:57,068
I mean, a little ambitious.

74
00:02:57,103 --> 00:02:59,437
We need to be ambitious,

75
00:02:59,472 --> 00:03:02,373
like Martin Chatwin facing
Ember and Umber ambitious.

76
00:03:02,409 --> 00:03:03,941
It can be done.

77
00:03:03,977 --> 00:03:06,611
But, you know, say
we get the perfect spell,

78
00:03:06,646 --> 00:03:08,913
think about the energy
it'd take to work it.

79
00:03:08,948 --> 00:03:10,815
- Right.
- See, Dana knew that.

80
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:12,083
She had her power source.

81
00:03:12,118 --> 00:03:15,720
We... I... got rid of mine.

82
00:03:15,755 --> 00:03:17,722
Well, what about Ember in Fillory,

83
00:03:17,757 --> 00:03:18,723
didn't he help Alice?

84
00:03:18,758 --> 00:03:20,625
He's completely AWOL.

85
00:03:22,362 --> 00:03:24,062
Oh, my God.

86
00:03:24,097 --> 00:03:26,998
Dana's baby, Reynard's son.

87
00:03:27,033 --> 00:03:28,966
And there is a ton of lore on demigods.

88
00:03:29,002 --> 00:03:30,635
They're powerful in their own right.

89
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,404
Dana was talking
like he's still out there.

90
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,007
We need to find him.

91
00:03:40,947 --> 00:03:43,081
Hurry up.

92
00:03:43,116 --> 00:03:45,083
I checked your work, it's fine.

93
00:03:45,118 --> 00:03:46,651
Nothing can break a Word As Bond.

94
00:03:46,686 --> 00:03:48,586
I must've overlooked something.

95
00:03:48,621 --> 00:03:51,089
No hurting anyone. No casting magic.

96
00:03:51,124 --> 00:03:52,557
No sex.

97
00:03:52,592 --> 00:03:55,526
Trust me, you locked down
any possible fun.

98
00:03:55,562 --> 00:03:58,096
I held up my end of the deal, Q.

99
00:03:58,131 --> 00:03:59,597
Now it's your turn.

100
00:03:59,632 --> 00:04:01,099
Or box me now

101
00:04:01,134 --> 00:04:04,102
'cause I'll drive you insane.

102
00:04:30,997 --> 00:04:33,097
Midnight, my turn. Got it?

103
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:38,703
Quentin! Where the hell are you?

104
00:04:38,738 --> 00:04:41,139
I'm just glad we managed
to sneak the golem out.

105
00:04:41,174 --> 00:04:45,209
Is it me or is morgue security
ridiculously lax?

106
00:04:45,245 --> 00:04:48,713
Well, I think stealing corpses
isn't generally a thing.

107
00:04:48,748 --> 00:04:50,581
Should be. Kind of fun.

108
00:04:50,617 --> 00:04:52,383
Anyway, according the Healer,

109
00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:54,252
the Bridge should take
a few days to enchant.

110
00:04:54,287 --> 00:04:56,487
Then his consciousness can travel it

111
00:04:56,523 --> 00:04:58,856
from the clay back to his body.

112
00:05:00,093 --> 00:05:02,427
And there's that.

113
00:05:02,462 --> 00:05:04,562
Magic brownout. Wellspring.

114
00:05:04,597 --> 00:05:05,396
Not helping.

115
00:05:05,432 --> 00:05:06,898
How often does that happen?

116
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:09,066
Lately? Sometimes twice a week.

117
00:05:09,102 --> 00:05:11,035
Sometimes twice an hour.

118
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,904
Affects anything that draws current.

119
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:15,406
Completely jacks all spellwork.

120
00:05:15,442 --> 00:05:17,742
We're still trying to fix it.

121
00:05:17,777 --> 00:05:20,077
Shall we go see the patient?

122
00:05:29,622 --> 00:05:31,789
How's it going?

123
00:05:31,825 --> 00:05:33,624
Every time the magic stutters,

124
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,461
they have to start the enchantment over.

125
00:05:36,496 --> 00:05:38,529
Enchant faster.

126
00:05:38,565 --> 00:05:41,098
Yes, Your Majesty.

127
00:05:41,134 --> 00:05:43,734
Is there anything else
that we can be doing?

128
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,636
Hold off the war till he's back.

129
00:05:46,606 --> 00:05:48,606
I had a pigeon drop a confusion spell

130
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:51,943
on the Lorian castle so
they're moving slow about now.

131
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:53,544
How can I help?

132
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,147
Honestly?

133
00:05:56,182 --> 00:05:59,250
You can go back to Brakebills
and check on Julia.

134
00:05:59,285 --> 00:06:01,252
You know you want to.

135
00:06:01,287 --> 00:06:03,054
If anything changes...

136
00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:06,057
I'll enchant a two-way mirror
to Brakebills,

137
00:06:06,092 --> 00:06:07,725
like when Rupert yelled at Jane

138
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,760
through the vanity table in the books.

139
00:06:12,532 --> 00:06:14,832
Hey,

140
00:06:14,868 --> 00:06:17,168
don't worry.

141
00:06:17,203 --> 00:06:20,738
My takeaway lately
is that anything can happen

142
00:06:20,773 --> 00:06:23,107
at any time.

143
00:06:23,142 --> 00:06:25,676
So just be there
for your friend while you can.

144
00:06:28,982 --> 00:06:30,281
Here.

145
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:40,791
Hey.

146
00:06:40,827 --> 00:06:41,859
Hey.

147
00:06:41,895 --> 00:06:43,261
How is she?

148
00:06:43,296 --> 00:06:45,162
Oh, well, she's...

149
00:06:45,198 --> 00:06:47,665
Holy shit.

150
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,667
That infomatrixing spell

151
00:06:49,702 --> 00:06:51,836
worked like a motherfucker.

152
00:06:51,871 --> 00:06:53,905
- Oh, hey, Q.
- Hey.

153
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,941
So I found a hospital outside of Hoboken

154
00:06:56,976 --> 00:06:58,709
that took in a surrendered newborn

155
00:06:58,745 --> 00:07:01,279
August 20, 1976.

156
00:07:01,314 --> 00:07:03,147
Holy shit.

157
00:07:10,156 --> 00:07:12,523
- Jules, what are you...
- I have to go.

158
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:14,892
No, you need to stay behind the wards.

159
00:07:14,928 --> 00:07:16,160
Reynard is...

160
00:07:16,195 --> 00:07:17,995
Reynard could give a shit about us.

161
00:07:18,031 --> 00:07:18,796
Think.

162
00:07:18,831 --> 00:07:20,731
If he was gonna finish me,

163
00:07:20,767 --> 00:07:21,799
he'd have done it by now.

164
00:07:21,834 --> 00:07:24,201
So let's take advantage of that.

165
00:07:27,407 --> 00:07:29,840
Uh, Jules, no, look, she's right.

166
00:07:29,876 --> 00:07:31,809
You're safer here.

167
00:07:31,844 --> 00:07:32,977
No offense, Q,

168
00:07:33,012 --> 00:07:34,812
I didn't actually ask your opinion.

169
00:07:34,847 --> 00:07:36,747
Thanks, though.

170
00:07:36,783 --> 00:07:37,815
Julia, wait.

171

172
00:07:51,764 --> 00:07:53,397
Hi, Julia.

173
00:07:58,004 --> 00:08:00,404
You thought I'd forgotten about you?

174
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,419
You seem like the type to move on quick

175
00:08:02,444 --> 00:08:03,841
when you're finished with a girl.

176
00:08:04,777 --> 00:08:07,244
Eh, generally.

177
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,213
Unless they're carrying my child.

178
00:08:13,152 --> 00:08:15,853
I was protecting you.

179
00:08:16,049 --> 00:08:19,023
And what did you go and do,
you little bitch?

180
00:08:19,221 --> 00:08:21,392
Now, Dana

181
00:08:21,427 --> 00:08:23,961
wouldn't tell me what I wanted to know.

182
00:08:23,997 --> 00:08:27,999
And it got very, very painful for her.

183
00:08:28,034 --> 00:08:30,101
But you have more

184
00:08:30,136 --> 00:08:32,236
common sense than she does.

185
00:08:32,271 --> 00:08:35,206
Tell me where her son is.

186
00:08:35,241 --> 00:08:36,774
Hm.

187
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:39,710
I don't know.

188
00:08:39,746 --> 00:08:40,911
Mm.

189
00:08:49,489 --> 00:08:50,988
You're different.

190
00:08:51,024 --> 00:08:52,790
Someone's had a little, uh,

191
00:08:52,825 --> 00:08:54,225
Shade amputation.

192
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:56,093
I like it.

193
00:08:59,465 --> 00:09:01,232
I know you're there.

194
00:09:01,267 --> 00:09:03,467
Boy.

195
00:09:03,503 --> 00:09:04,935
Quentin.

196
00:09:07,106 --> 00:09:08,172
All right, run.

197
00:09:08,207 --> 00:09:10,174
Go on, run.

198
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:12,910
I'll give you a head start.

199
00:09:18,851 --> 00:09:21,085
I get it. You want to keep me safe.

200
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,153
Thank you.

201
00:09:22,188 --> 00:09:24,255
I'm saying, I just can't

202
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:26,190
sit on my thumbs in Fillory.

203
00:09:26,225 --> 00:09:28,092
Look, you had the thing
before, the Haxenpaxen,

204
00:09:28,127 --> 00:09:30,027
that... that was
making you invisible, right?

205
00:09:30,063 --> 00:09:30,961
So we're in Fillory.

206
00:09:30,997 --> 00:09:32,763
There's a lot of crazy shit here.

207
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:34,198
So find something else.
Then you can go back.

208
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:35,466
You don't get it.

209
00:09:35,501 --> 00:09:37,001
There isn't time.

210
00:09:37,036 --> 00:09:39,036
Hm. She's right, Q, there isn't.

211
00:09:39,072 --> 00:09:40,705
It's my turn soon.

212
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,173
Tick tock.

213
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,874
Uh, okay, look,

214
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,210
I am going to go back. I'll help Kady.

215
00:09:46,245 --> 00:09:47,845
We're... we're gonna keep working.

216
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,280
Margo.

217
00:09:49,315 --> 00:09:51,949
Uh, Julia needs
to stay here for a while.

218
00:09:51,984 --> 00:09:53,451
It's an emergency.

219
00:09:53,486 --> 00:09:55,486
- Fine.
- Thank you.

220
00:09:58,324 --> 00:09:59,857
It's a nice place.

221
00:10:03,896 --> 00:10:04,528
Tick tock.

222
00:10:04,564 --> 00:10:05,830
Oh, shit.

223
00:10:12,238 --> 00:10:14,505
Dude, are you okay?

224
00:10:17,176 --> 00:10:19,910
I'm fine. Nothing to see here.

225
00:10:21,514 --> 00:10:23,314
Using the gold you procured,

226
00:10:23,349 --> 00:10:25,816
we have been able
to amply fund the infantry.

227
00:10:25,852 --> 00:10:27,318
Now, as for Loria...

228
00:10:27,353 --> 00:10:30,020
Some 8,000 troops
are headed to the border.

229
00:10:30,056 --> 00:10:31,355
So we're totally outnumbered.

230
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:33,324
Perhaps not.

231
00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:36,827
Our spies have spotted
the Master Magician Illario

232
00:10:36,863 --> 00:10:37,995
at the edge of the woods.

233
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,597
That bald illusionist dick

234
00:10:39,632 --> 00:10:41,499
who disappeared the entire castle?

235
00:10:41,534 --> 00:10:44,368
We suspect he has enhanced
the number of troops

236
00:10:44,403 --> 00:10:45,669
with trickery.

237
00:10:45,705 --> 00:10:48,205
We believe the actual numbers
are under 3,000.

238
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:49,340
I like those odds.

239
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:52,042
There is also less good news.

240
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:54,345
Said troops appear to be amassing

241
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,514
at the edge of the One-Way-Forest.

242
00:10:56,549 --> 00:10:58,582
A forest of intelligent trees.

243
00:10:58,618 --> 00:11:00,451
Yeah, I've read about it.

244
00:11:00,486 --> 00:11:02,353
Jane Chatwin tried to pass once and...

245
00:11:02,388 --> 00:11:04,622
Uhh, the trees have a

246
00:11:04,657 --> 00:11:06,524
long allegiance with Loria

247
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:10,227
and, begging pardon,
an excessive dislike of Fillory.

248
00:11:10,263 --> 00:11:12,530
Can you move the trees?

249
00:11:12,565 --> 00:11:14,565
They are rooted, Your Highness.

250
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,201
Yeah. I mean with an ax.

251
00:11:17,236 --> 00:11:19,937
That would be ill advised.
They are the last of their kind.

252
00:11:21,908 --> 00:11:23,007
Her Languidness suggests

253
00:11:23,042 --> 00:11:25,209
violence against the One-Way-Forest

254
00:11:25,244 --> 00:11:27,144
could cause civil war here in Fillory.

255
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,612
Well, in the books, the trees had

256
00:11:28,648 --> 00:11:31,215
some sort of ambassador, a dryad.

257
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,550
You need to negotiate with her.

258
00:11:32,585 --> 00:11:35,352
Your Highness, we would not advise...

259
00:11:37,256 --> 00:11:39,056
That worked for Jane?

260
00:11:39,091 --> 00:11:40,424
- Sold.
- Great.

261
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:41,392
I'll come with you.

262
00:11:41,427 --> 00:11:44,295
Uhh, custom strongly dictates that...

263
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:45,729
Yeah, I don't care.

264
00:11:45,765 --> 00:11:48,399
Look, I know the books
almost as well as Quentin does.

265
00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm bored.

266
00:11:50,036 --> 00:11:51,836
Let me be a little useful, okay?

267
00:11:51,871 --> 00:11:53,911
Fine. But I do the talking.

268
00:11:53,943 --> 00:11:57,975
You just stand there and look
vaguely indignant or whatever.

269
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,610
Let's go.

270
00:12:12,491 --> 00:12:13,652
It wasn't enough.

271
00:12:14,157 --> 00:12:16,491
I need more time.

272
00:12:16,526 --> 00:12:17,859
To do what?

273
00:12:17,979 --> 00:12:20,127
None of your business.

274
00:12:20,797 --> 00:12:23,098
Relax, it's nothing.

275
00:12:29,806 --> 00:12:30,872
What?

276
00:12:30,907 --> 00:12:32,147
I like to read. Is that a crime?

277
00:12:32,175 --> 00:12:33,842
You can't be serious.

278
00:12:33,877 --> 00:12:36,611
I have the right to know
what I've been doing.

279
00:12:36,646 --> 00:12:38,513
Illuminated manuscripts.

280
00:12:38,548 --> 00:12:40,548
I remember this from Art History.

281
00:12:40,584 --> 00:12:42,717
Yeah. A-plus for you.

282
00:12:42,753 --> 00:12:44,786
I was just bored.

283
00:12:44,821 --> 00:12:47,388
The monks got tired
of writing the same thing

284
00:12:47,424 --> 00:12:50,959
over and over again so they...

285
00:12:50,994 --> 00:12:53,128
they embellished in the margins.

286
00:12:53,163 --> 00:12:55,697
Well, a lot of priests dabbled in magic.

287
00:12:55,732 --> 00:12:57,065
Some exploded.

288
00:13:01,738 --> 00:13:02,871
Yeah.

289
00:13:02,906 --> 00:13:04,639
Those monks were drama queens.

290
00:13:04,674 --> 00:13:06,975
Okay. "There must be another way

291
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:11,479
to bring back our brother"?

292
00:13:11,515 --> 00:13:14,482
Are you looking for a way to reverse it?

293
00:13:14,518 --> 00:13:17,452
No. No, Q, I'm not.

294
00:13:17,487 --> 00:13:19,387
Then why are you reading about
all these holy men

295
00:13:19,422 --> 00:13:20,422
trying to fix niffins?

296
00:13:20,457 --> 00:13:22,090
What does it matter, Q?

297
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,424
They always fail.

298
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,893
Alice.

299
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:30,932
Oh, my God.

300
00:13:36,773 --> 00:13:37,839
Welcome back, Penny.

301
00:13:37,874 --> 00:13:38,773
I need a book.

302
00:13:38,809 --> 00:13:40,742
"Future Movements in Magic."

303
00:13:40,777 --> 00:13:43,845
All right. Follow me.

304
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,680
Don't they have a copy at Brakebills?

305
00:13:45,715 --> 00:13:46,848
It got destroyed.

306
00:13:46,883 --> 00:13:51,452
I figure you guys
have every book here, so.

307
00:13:51,488 --> 00:13:53,021
Unfortunately, you won't be able

308
00:13:53,056 --> 00:13:54,189
to take this off the premises

309
00:13:54,224 --> 00:13:56,191
since you don't have a library card.

310
00:13:56,226 --> 00:13:58,693
Oh, no-no, I got one, um.

311
00:13:58,728 --> 00:14:00,428
I'm just the errand boy.

312
00:14:00,463 --> 00:14:02,764
Mayakovsky.

313
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:04,232
I'm surprised the two of you get along.

314
00:14:04,267 --> 00:14:07,035
No, we don't. Believe me.

315
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,103
My hands won't cast.

316
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,939
He's the only one that can help me,

317
00:14:10,974 --> 00:14:13,141
if I finish fetching
his goddamn grocery list

318
00:14:13,176 --> 00:14:14,943
so we can get started, so.

319
00:14:14,978 --> 00:14:16,211
Ah.

320
00:14:16,246 --> 00:14:17,545
I can put a rush on this book.

321
00:14:17,581 --> 00:14:18,980
Thank you.

322
00:14:19,015 --> 00:14:20,982
If you're sure
that's what you really want.

323
00:14:21,017 --> 00:14:22,717
Well, I really want magic, so, yeah.

324
00:14:22,752 --> 00:14:25,053
But to pay for it with
servitude to a lying drunkard...

325
00:14:25,088 --> 00:14:26,955
What's the alternative?

326
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,489
Us.

327
00:14:28,525 --> 00:14:30,258
You?

328
00:14:30,293 --> 00:14:32,227
Librarians?

329
00:14:32,262 --> 00:14:33,895
The Order of the Library
of the Neitherlands

330
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,797
are Master Magicians.

331
00:14:35,832 --> 00:14:37,732
We can help you, Penny.

332
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:40,068
'Kay.

333
00:14:40,103 --> 00:14:42,570
What's the catch?

334
00:14:42,606 --> 00:14:44,672
This contract initiates our services

335
00:14:44,708 --> 00:14:45,573
in exchange for...

336
00:14:45,609 --> 00:14:48,643
Unlimited manual and magical labor?

337
00:14:48,678 --> 00:14:50,178
Bound in service to the library

338
00:14:50,213 --> 00:14:52,180
up to and after my death,
are you kidding?

339
00:14:52,215 --> 00:14:53,715
All very standard.

340
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,750
For a period of no less
than one million years?

341
00:14:55,785 --> 00:14:57,619
Okay, lady, are you joking?

342
00:14:57,654 --> 00:14:59,120
No.

343
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,723
Okay.

344
00:15:03,793 --> 00:15:05,526
Okay, here's what Julia found.

345
00:15:05,562 --> 00:15:07,662
August 20, 1976.

346
00:15:07,697 --> 00:15:10,732
Baby surrendered at hospital.

347
00:15:10,767 --> 00:15:12,834
Uh, a nurse, Michelle Walker

348
00:15:12,869 --> 00:15:16,271
transferred it to
a state social worker, uh.

349
00:15:16,306 --> 00:15:18,673
And after that

350
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:20,675
nothing, there's
no record of adoption or...

351
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:22,043
Okay, so,

352
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:23,811
where's Michelle Walker now?

353
00:15:27,017 --> 00:15:28,883
Merciful Sisters Cemetery.

354
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:30,952
Oh, shit.

355
00:15:30,987 --> 00:15:32,620
Sh.

356
00:15:35,158 --> 00:15:36,624
Shit what?

357
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,360
Just... dead ended again.

358
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:40,862
How's Mayakovsky?

359
00:15:40,897 --> 00:15:42,664
Oh, still a jerk-off, you know.

360
00:15:45,735 --> 00:15:47,335
What's wrong with you?

361
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,736
Hm?

362
00:15:48,772 --> 00:15:51,072
Your mind is

363
00:15:51,107 --> 00:15:54,809
- doing something.
- Uh, no, it's not.

364
00:15:54,844 --> 00:15:57,145
He's talking about me, Q.

365
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,579
- Stop that.
- Stop what?

366
00:15:58,615 --> 00:16:01,249
Stop singing Imagine Dragons
to get me off the track.

367
00:16:01,284 --> 00:16:03,184
Lock it up, Q. Seriously.

368
00:16:03,219 --> 00:16:04,986
Look, why are you always
poking around in me anyway?

369
00:16:05,021 --> 00:16:06,087
Can you just leave me alone?

370
00:16:06,122 --> 00:16:07,122
Oh, I'd love to.

371
00:16:07,157 --> 00:16:08,256
You leak, asshole.

372
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:11,225
Okay. I have got to, uh...

373
00:16:15,131 --> 00:16:16,364
The hell was that?

374
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,667
Something's wronger than usual.

375
00:16:19,703 --> 00:16:22,070
And he's a grown man.

376
00:16:22,105 --> 00:16:23,838
Moving on.

377
00:16:23,873 --> 00:16:25,340
Have you eaten lately?

378
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:27,208
You should eat.

379
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:32,780
Penny, we still haven't...

380
00:16:32,816 --> 00:16:34,182
you know,

381
00:16:34,217 --> 00:16:36,184
talked.

382
00:16:37,787 --> 00:16:39,854
Uh, I thought we weren't gonna.

383
00:16:39,889 --> 00:16:42,790
Yeah, well, that was
when this was some quick fun,

384
00:16:42,826 --> 00:16:45,193
not hanging out 24/7

385
00:16:45,228 --> 00:16:47,795
fucking our brains out, robbing banks.

386
00:16:47,831 --> 00:16:49,864
That is fun.

387
00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:50,965
It's all I need.

388
00:16:52,135 --> 00:16:53,301
Okay, here's the deal.

389
00:16:53,336 --> 00:16:55,269
I can't exactly study magic

390
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,971
unless I sign an insane contract

391
00:16:57,007 --> 00:16:59,640
or Mayakovsky stops dicking around.

392
00:16:59,676 --> 00:17:01,976
What I can do
is help stop the evil freak

393
00:17:02,012 --> 00:17:04,045
that tried to rip your heart
out of your chest.

394
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,758
I'll sleep better with him dead. Simple.

395
00:17:07,004 --> 00:17:09,550
You want to keep things
professional? Fine.

396
00:17:09,586 --> 00:17:10,885
It's no big deal.

397
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,456
Good.

398
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:32,649
Greetings!

399
00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:37,195
I am Margo, High Queen of Fillory.

400
00:17:39,232 --> 00:17:41,966
Habla Ingles or what?

401
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,440
Hi.

402
00:17:49,476 --> 00:17:51,209
So you the nymph?

403
00:17:51,244 --> 00:17:52,844
Dryad.

404
00:17:52,879 --> 00:17:54,278
I thought you were all girls.

405
00:17:54,314 --> 00:17:57,548
Listen, I know your
tree buddies don't like us.

406
00:17:57,584 --> 00:17:59,517
The rulers of Fillory
have a long and tragic

407
00:17:59,552 --> 00:18:01,019
history of arboreal disrespect.

408
00:18:01,054 --> 00:18:02,587
Yeah, okay.

409
00:18:02,622 --> 00:18:03,855
Look, it's a new day.

410
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,090
We're a kinder, gentler Fillory.

411
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:09,093
So we need to settle some unrest
with our Lorian neighbors.

412
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,295
Settle unrest.

413
00:18:11,331 --> 00:18:12,630
You mean wage war.

414
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,132
No, we mean

415
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:15,700
button some messy shit up.

416
00:18:15,735 --> 00:18:17,435
Help us here.

417
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,970
We want to make this work.

418
00:18:19,005 --> 00:18:19,971
Respectfully.

419
00:18:20,006 --> 00:18:21,372
That's rich.

420
00:18:21,408 --> 00:18:23,574
Considering your king
apparently wouldn't deign

421
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,543
to come here himself,

422
00:18:25,578 --> 00:18:28,646
sending two females.

423
00:18:28,682 --> 00:18:32,950
Hey, this is Julia.

424
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:35,953
Royal Ambassador.

425
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:38,823
And I am Fillory's
one and only High Queen.

426
00:18:38,858 --> 00:18:40,892
Yes. The insult's been noted.

427
00:18:40,927 --> 00:18:42,660
Passage is denied.

428
00:18:42,696 --> 00:18:43,828
Good day.

429
00:18:46,866 --> 00:18:50,168
Damn it.

430
00:18:50,203 --> 00:18:51,269
Let's go.

431
00:19:05,618 --> 00:19:06,684
Before you ask, no.

432
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,753
No luck with the adoption records.

433
00:19:08,788 --> 00:19:12,423
No luck with the hospital.
And no luck with the nurse.

434
00:19:12,459 --> 00:19:13,691
What's wrong with you?

435
00:19:13,727 --> 00:19:15,593
Your wards are airtight.

436
00:19:15,628 --> 00:19:16,661
You complained, so I fixed them.

437
00:19:16,696 --> 00:19:19,097
Since when are you
that good at fixing anything?

438
00:19:19,132 --> 00:19:20,932
Can we agree that I lose
no matter what I say,

439
00:19:20,967 --> 00:19:21,999
and just stop talking?

440
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:24,602
So Reynard's kid.

441
00:19:24,637 --> 00:19:25,870
Yeah, so,

442
00:19:25,905 --> 00:19:27,205
the trail stops when the nurse dies.

443
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,639
Shit.

444
00:19:28,675 --> 00:19:31,776
If only there was a way
to literally see into the past.

445
00:19:31,811 --> 00:19:33,311
You know, I think I just remembered

446
00:19:33,346 --> 00:19:34,545
there might be a way.

447
00:19:34,581 --> 00:19:36,814
Yeah, time bridge. We thought of that.

448
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,049
There's nothing close enough.

449
00:19:38,084 --> 00:19:39,317
No, uh,

450
00:19:39,352 --> 00:19:41,519
time sight, literally.

451
00:19:41,554 --> 00:19:42,954
We never studied that.

452
00:19:42,989 --> 00:19:45,857
Uh, no, but I think Alice did.

453
00:19:45,892 --> 00:19:47,859
Hmm, uh, can't remember.

454
00:19:47,894 --> 00:19:49,193
Did she or didn't she?

455
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,528
She did, uh.

456
00:19:50,563 --> 00:19:52,063
I think it was

457
00:19:52,098 --> 00:19:54,866
uh, uh, extra reading

458
00:19:54,901 --> 00:19:56,801
in Metageology?

459
00:19:56,836 --> 00:19:57,769
- Nope.
- Nope.

460
00:19:57,804 --> 00:20:00,471
Um, oh, I think, or, it was an elective

461
00:20:00,507 --> 00:20:02,740
in, uh, Basics in Vedic Prognostication.

462
00:20:02,776 --> 00:20:04,876
- Nope.
- Nope. Um.

463
00:20:04,911 --> 00:20:06,911
Give me an extra hour tonight
and I'll tell you.

464
00:20:06,946 --> 00:20:07,912
Hm.

465
00:20:07,947 --> 00:20:09,313
Was it, uh, something we learned

466
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:11,682
in Sunderland's class, I mean,
'cause we never studied...

467
00:20:11,718 --> 00:20:13,651
Are you, like,

468
00:20:13,686 --> 00:20:16,020
having an ADD moment right now, or?

469
00:20:16,055 --> 00:20:18,055
No... it... um...

470
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:18,990
Okay, so here's the thing.

471
00:20:19,025 --> 00:20:20,858
Um, there's this one time,

472
00:20:20,894 --> 00:20:22,193
Alice and I, right?

473
00:20:22,228 --> 00:20:23,594
We were studying;

474
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:26,097
we were sharing lab materials.

475
00:20:26,132 --> 00:20:27,231
And people didn't know this about Alice,

476
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,567
but she was really greedy

477
00:20:29,602 --> 00:20:31,502
with her lab materials.

478
00:20:31,538 --> 00:20:33,070
Um, and

479
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:35,840
so she would offer to help me
for extra time with them...

480
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,875
None of this
is interesting to any of us.

481
00:20:37,911 --> 00:20:38,911
The point is

482
00:20:38,945 --> 00:20:42,180
I would say 20 extra minutes,

483
00:20:42,215 --> 00:20:44,015
one time offer,

484
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,116
take it or leave it.

485
00:20:45,151 --> 00:20:46,250
30.

486
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:49,220
Fine. Deal.

487
00:20:49,255 --> 00:20:50,688
Is how that would go.

488
00:20:50,723 --> 00:20:52,690
In a nutshell.

489
00:20:52,725 --> 00:20:53,758
Phosphoromancy.

490
00:20:53,793 --> 00:20:55,927
My discipline, idiot.

491
00:20:55,962 --> 00:20:58,696
McKellan's got a scope that
can bend light into the past.

492
00:20:58,731 --> 00:21:01,699
Phosphoromancy.

493
00:21:01,734 --> 00:21:03,267
Ugh. I'm an idiot.

494
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,303
Correct.

495
00:21:04,337 --> 00:21:06,604
Shut up, I... remembered.

496
00:21:06,639 --> 00:21:08,306
Uh, okay, so

497
00:21:08,341 --> 00:21:11,142
the viewing device, it's
in Professor McKellan's office.

498
00:21:11,177 --> 00:21:13,110
Ooh, Penny.

499
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,746
See, even he can't wait
to get away from you.

500
00:21:18,351 --> 00:21:20,718
Is this thing gonna work or not?

501
00:21:20,753 --> 00:21:22,920
Eliot has shit to do.

502
00:21:22,956 --> 00:21:25,623
He has to do the work of crossing back.

503
00:21:25,658 --> 00:21:27,825
Not everyone chooses to do so.

504
00:21:27,861 --> 00:21:31,128
Okay. Can you step out for a minute?

505
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,197
Fen, you too, sweetie.

506
00:21:40,773 --> 00:21:43,574
Eliot,

507
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:47,245
you need to come back.

508
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,648
I know that you have
a constant low-key death wish,

509
00:21:50,683 --> 00:21:54,252
but you can't leave.

510
00:21:54,287 --> 00:21:56,187
They don't want me.

511
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,323
They want the High King.

512
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:12,937
I'm faking it, El.

513
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:19,277
So if you could just

514
00:22:19,312 --> 00:22:21,913
please,

515
00:22:21,948 --> 00:22:25,082
please, wake up.

516
00:22:37,063 --> 00:22:40,031
I set it to August 20, 1976.

517
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,037
Holy shit.

518
00:22:48,374 --> 00:22:49,507
What, what do you see?

519
00:22:49,542 --> 00:22:51,008
Uh, just

520
00:22:51,044 --> 00:22:52,510
people waiting.

521
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,653
Oh, here we go.

522
00:23:02,689 --> 00:23:04,155
What?

523
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:07,258
A nurse with a baby.

524
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,235
Uh.

525
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:21,105
What?

526
00:23:23,576 --> 00:23:25,076
You got to be kidding me.

527
00:23:25,111 --> 00:23:26,777
What?

528
00:23:26,813 --> 00:23:27,845
What's wrong?

529
00:23:32,118 --> 00:23:35,119
Ah, shit.

530
00:23:35,154 --> 00:23:36,387
Dana did this.

531
00:23:36,422 --> 00:23:38,289
To protect the baby's identity,

532
00:23:38,324 --> 00:23:41,292
even from spells 40 years in the future.

533
00:23:41,327 --> 00:23:43,841
She thought of everything.

534
00:23:45,668 --> 00:23:47,315
And back to square nothing.

535
00:24:14,773 --> 00:24:15,672
Hi.

536
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:17,407
I'm Julia.

537
00:24:17,443 --> 00:24:18,909
God, been waiting hours

538
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,811
for you to get close enough to grab.

539
00:24:20,846 --> 00:24:22,512
I think my foot fell asleep.

540
00:24:22,548 --> 00:24:24,348
I will never help Fillory.

541
00:24:24,383 --> 00:24:25,482
I'd sooner be skinned.

542
00:24:25,517 --> 00:24:27,417
All right, boys, let him go.

543
00:24:27,453 --> 00:24:29,686
Give us some air, but stay close-ish.

544
00:24:32,157 --> 00:24:33,757
Hate Fillory all you want.

545
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,092
I'm here for one thing,

546
00:24:35,127 --> 00:24:36,793
and then I'm off this planet.

547
00:24:36,829 --> 00:24:38,662
An invisibility spell

548
00:24:38,697 --> 00:24:41,765
strong enough to hide from a god.

549
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,833
And why should I give it to you?

550
00:24:42,868 --> 00:24:45,535
Because I may not
give a shit about Fillory.

551
00:24:45,571 --> 00:24:47,871
But I do, as its Royal Ambassador,

552
00:24:47,906 --> 00:24:50,974
have access to
its guards and its dungeons.

553
00:24:51,009 --> 00:24:53,944
And I'll use A to throw you in B,

554
00:24:53,979 --> 00:24:56,446
but help me, and I'll let you go free.

555
00:24:56,482 --> 00:24:57,614
I don't believe you.

556
00:24:57,649 --> 00:24:58,682
Your loyalty will always lie with...

557
00:24:58,717 --> 00:25:00,150
With me.

558
00:25:00,185 --> 00:25:02,452
My loyalty will always lie with me.

559
00:25:29,181 --> 00:25:31,715
Drill a hole in it. Wear it.

560
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:32,916
No god can sense you.

561
00:25:32,951 --> 00:25:35,685
Thank you.

562
00:25:35,721 --> 00:25:37,721
You're free to go.

563
00:25:46,698 --> 00:25:48,532
Hey, dryad boy!

564
00:25:49,601 --> 00:25:52,869
Come on out.
I saw you in there, sweetheart.

565
00:25:56,708 --> 00:25:59,109
Negotiations are over.

566
00:25:59,144 --> 00:26:00,844
Go home.

567
00:26:00,879 --> 00:26:03,547
I brought you something.

568
00:26:06,318 --> 00:26:08,018
A small token of peace.

569
00:26:08,053 --> 00:26:09,286
It won't change anything.

570
00:26:09,321 --> 00:26:11,621
Just give it to your bosses.

571
00:26:11,657 --> 00:26:13,890
I'm trying to fix this.

572
00:26:23,735 --> 00:26:25,001
Thank you.

573
00:27:06,345 --> 00:27:07,978
I've been looking for you.

574
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:14,518
You've lived here since
the Bush administration,

575
00:27:14,553 --> 00:27:16,286
but you're thousands of years old.

576
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:22,659
You're an AnglerBeast.

577
00:27:22,694 --> 00:27:24,194
That's stupid.

578
00:27:24,229 --> 00:27:26,296
You play too much Dungeons and Dragons.

579
00:27:28,901 --> 00:27:32,102
You knew a man, a long time ago.

580
00:27:32,137 --> 00:27:34,304
He was special and
he lived in a monastery,

581
00:27:34,339 --> 00:27:36,339
a Master Magician.

582
00:27:36,375 --> 00:27:38,875
Friar Joseph.

583
00:27:38,911 --> 00:27:40,210
Ring a bell?

584
00:27:44,349 --> 00:27:46,550
I want to know everything about him.

585
00:27:46,585 --> 00:27:50,053
Well, in the parlance of your time,

586
00:27:50,088 --> 00:27:53,290
fuck you, pay me.

587
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,127
Fresh meat.

588
00:27:57,162 --> 00:28:00,297
Newborns are the sweetest.

589
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,068
You know, I thought about doing that,

590
00:28:05,103 --> 00:28:07,304
but my time is very limited.

591
00:28:07,339 --> 00:28:11,308
So I researched your weak spots instead.

592
00:28:11,343 --> 00:28:13,343
And you believe what you read?

593
00:28:23,121 --> 00:28:26,022
That was stupid of you.

594
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:40,403
Oh, my God.

595
00:28:43,408 --> 00:28:44,841
Alice, what did you do?

596
00:28:44,876 --> 00:28:46,343
Relax.

597
00:28:46,378 --> 00:28:49,746
Can't hurt anybody, remember?

598
00:28:49,781 --> 00:28:50,781
But she's...

599
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,782
A monster.

600
00:28:52,818 --> 00:28:53,950
Technically, I did good here.

601
00:28:53,986 --> 00:28:57,187
I mean, there's a ton of
kid bones in this sandbox.

602
00:28:57,222 --> 00:29:01,358
It wasn't cooperating so I had to use

603
00:29:01,393 --> 00:29:04,027
enhanced interrogation techniques.

604
00:29:04,062 --> 00:29:06,029
To find out what?

605
00:29:06,064 --> 00:29:09,065
We might want to go before
the rest of it lumbers up here.

606
00:29:09,101 --> 00:29:11,067
It's pretty mad at me.

607
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,474
What the hell were you thinking, huh?

608
00:29:17,509 --> 00:29:19,209
You burned down the One-Way-Forest

609
00:29:19,244 --> 00:29:22,712
while I'm trying to
wiggle us out of full-on war?

610
00:29:22,748 --> 00:29:24,881
Those trees were dicks.

611
00:29:24,916 --> 00:29:26,650
They were endangered.

612
00:29:26,685 --> 00:29:28,985
Now trees all over Fillory are enraged

613
00:29:29,021 --> 00:29:29,853
and calling for action.

614
00:29:29,888 --> 00:29:32,889
Do you have any idea
what you did, Julia?

615
00:29:32,924 --> 00:29:34,290
Yeah.

616
00:29:34,326 --> 00:29:35,959
I helped you.

617
00:29:35,994 --> 00:29:37,427
Now you can cross into Loria

618
00:29:37,462 --> 00:29:39,462
and kick their fucking asses
like you wanted to.

619
00:29:39,498 --> 00:29:42,265
This is not how
I wanted to go about that.

620
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,167
Yeah, I know.

621
00:29:44,202 --> 00:29:45,902
So the really good news is

622
00:29:45,937 --> 00:29:47,904
you didn't do anything.

623
00:29:47,939 --> 00:29:49,739
Go back and tell the angry tree lobby

624
00:29:49,775 --> 00:29:52,008
it was all crazy Julia.

625
00:29:52,044 --> 00:29:52,909
You're welcome.

626
00:29:52,944 --> 00:29:54,844
Look, I got what I wanted.

627
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,312
The rest was all a favor to you.

628
00:29:56,348 --> 00:29:58,181
So banish me forever.

629
00:29:58,216 --> 00:30:00,417
Send me home.

630
00:30:00,452 --> 00:30:02,952
You know, in a sick way,

631
00:30:02,988 --> 00:30:04,921
I sort of admire you.

632
00:30:04,956 --> 00:30:07,123
That being said, here's what we do

633
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:09,759
to loose cannons in Fillory, ready?

634
00:30:10,962 --> 00:30:12,796
Guards!

635
00:30:12,831 --> 00:30:15,699
Take this bitch to the dungeon.

636
00:30:15,734 --> 00:30:16,933
You gotta be kidding me.

637
00:30:16,968 --> 00:30:19,269
Now, if you'll excuse me,

638
00:30:19,304 --> 00:30:21,137
I have some damage control to do.

639
00:30:25,877 --> 00:30:28,111
How to break a Word As Bond.

640
00:30:30,816 --> 00:30:33,950
Reversing a Word As Bond.

641
00:30:33,985 --> 00:30:35,885
Amending a Word As Bond.

642
00:30:35,921 --> 00:30:37,821
It's not there.

643
00:30:37,856 --> 00:30:40,857
That's the whole point.
You can't break it.

644
00:30:40,892 --> 00:30:42,525
Why don't you do something useful

645
00:30:42,561 --> 00:30:46,563
and catch up on all the classes
you missed in Fillory?

646
00:30:46,598 --> 00:30:47,964
This isn't working.

647
00:30:47,999 --> 00:30:48,999
Yeah, tell me about it.

648
00:30:49,034 --> 00:30:50,967
Keeping you a secret
and trying to help you

649
00:30:51,002 --> 00:30:53,970
while you do God knows what.

650
00:30:54,005 --> 00:30:56,306
I have to ask for help.
I need to tell someone.

651
00:30:56,341 --> 00:30:57,507
Great idea.

652
00:30:57,542 --> 00:30:59,909
You think you know locked up for crazy?

653
00:30:59,945 --> 00:31:01,478
They'll put you someplace
you can't even imagine.

654
00:31:01,513 --> 00:31:03,313
And they'll box me up so quick...

655
00:31:03,348 --> 00:31:04,647
all your efforts for nothing.
Is that what you want?

656
00:31:04,683 --> 00:31:07,050
I want Alice back. I want the real you.

657
00:31:07,085 --> 00:31:09,552
I want... I...

658
00:31:09,588 --> 00:31:11,488
I can't help Fillory.

659
00:31:11,523 --> 00:31:12,822
And I can't help Eliot.

660
00:31:12,858 --> 00:31:14,257
And I can't help Julia.

661
00:31:14,292 --> 00:31:16,726
And I just want to do...

662
00:31:16,762 --> 00:31:18,862
God, one thing for the person
that deserves it the most.

663
00:31:18,897 --> 00:31:22,198
That's what I want.

664
00:31:22,234 --> 00:31:23,399
God.

665
00:31:26,438 --> 00:31:28,171
I understand.

666
00:31:30,609 --> 00:31:33,843
Do you want to know the truth?

667
00:31:33,879 --> 00:31:35,745
You are a failure.

668
00:31:35,781 --> 00:31:39,182
So stop using me to try to fix that.

669
00:31:39,217 --> 00:31:41,017
Uh-oh, look at the time.

670
00:31:41,051 --> 00:31:44,085
- Uh... wait... no.
- Word As Bond, kid. My turn.

671
00:31:53,219 --> 00:31:55,219
What are we drinking to?

672
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:58,422
Dead ends.

673
00:32:02,901 --> 00:32:04,000
What?

674
00:32:04,036 --> 00:32:05,535
I'm adjusting.

675
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:06,970
You used to hold your liquor better.

676
00:32:07,005 --> 00:32:09,072
Yeah, well, I used to drink for fun.

677
00:32:11,109 --> 00:32:12,976
Now I drink to get too fucked up

678
00:32:13,011 --> 00:32:15,949
to go out and do anything worse.

679
00:32:16,515 --> 00:32:19,382
God, I hope this works as a mixer.

680
00:32:23,088 --> 00:32:24,754
Oh...

681
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:27,824
did I forget to mention
that I have to take this now?

682
00:32:27,859 --> 00:32:29,426
'Cause I'm a junkie.

683
00:32:29,461 --> 00:32:31,061
Ah.

684
00:32:31,096 --> 00:32:33,330
Just trying to stay straight long enough

685
00:32:33,365 --> 00:32:36,833
to find Reynard without
falling the fuck apart.

686
00:32:36,868 --> 00:32:38,101
Kady, we're...

687
00:32:38,136 --> 00:32:41,204
we're gonna find the son.

688
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:43,106
You think?

689
00:32:43,141 --> 00:32:44,941
I think

690
00:32:44,976 --> 00:32:46,076
you and me,

691
00:32:46,111 --> 00:32:48,578
put our minds together?

692
00:32:48,613 --> 00:32:49,846
Shit gets done.

693
00:32:49,881 --> 00:32:52,015
Oh, God.

694
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:55,118
That is so stupid it's sad.

695
00:32:55,153 --> 00:32:57,187
And I don't think you were listening

696
00:32:57,222 --> 00:32:58,988
when I said I'm not
your fucking girlfriend...

697
00:32:59,024 --> 00:33:00,757
Good. I don't want one.

698
00:33:00,792 --> 00:33:02,459
Oh, yeah.

699
00:33:02,494 --> 00:33:03,593
Yeah, I get it.

700
00:33:03,628 --> 00:33:06,930
Yeah, you're very tough, right?

701
00:33:06,965 --> 00:33:09,766
Oh, God... yeah, you're real cool.

702
00:33:09,801 --> 00:33:12,702
You're not hearing me.

703
00:33:12,738 --> 00:33:14,871
I am not your problem.

704
00:33:14,906 --> 00:33:16,906
This isn't your chance to prove

705
00:33:16,942 --> 00:33:20,110
that you're some kind of hero.

706
00:33:20,145 --> 00:33:24,614
You want your dick sucked?
Great, I can do that.

707
00:33:24,649 --> 00:33:28,818
Then I'd love it if you'd fuck off.

708
00:33:56,114 --> 00:33:58,481
BBC World News...

709
00:33:58,517 --> 00:34:00,183
I had him stop for fish and chips.

710
00:34:00,218 --> 00:34:02,018
Best shop in Dublin, he said.

711
00:34:02,053 --> 00:34:03,286
Are you kidding me?

712
00:34:05,223 --> 00:34:07,157
Wait, uh, no, no, just, uh,

713
00:34:07,192 --> 00:34:10,527
just wait here for a second.

714
00:34:10,562 --> 00:34:12,695
You portaled us to Ireland?

715
00:34:13,698 --> 00:34:14,764
To do what?

716
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,099
- Where are we going?
- Home.

717
00:34:16,134 --> 00:34:17,667
It's done. We already did it.

718
00:34:17,702 --> 00:34:20,703
Did what?

719
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:24,274
Alice, what did you do?

720
00:34:24,309 --> 00:34:25,309
Uh,

721
00:34:25,343 --> 00:34:28,211
oh, uh, sir,
where did we just come from?

722
00:34:28,246 --> 00:34:29,846
About three streets that way.

723
00:34:29,881 --> 00:34:32,182
Great. Can we go back there now?

724
00:34:32,217 --> 00:34:34,017
Right.

725
00:34:34,052 --> 00:34:37,220
Wait, Quentin, no. I'm serious, don't.

726
00:34:37,255 --> 00:34:39,155
Q, stop. Hold on.

727
00:34:39,191 --> 00:34:42,225
Q, please, wait.

728
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,160
Please, Quentin, don't.

729
00:34:59,377 --> 00:35:00,810
You...

730
00:35:00,846 --> 00:35:03,079
Tricked you with reverse psychology?

731
00:35:03,114 --> 00:35:04,714
It was shockingly easy.

732
00:35:04,749 --> 00:35:06,349
"No, don't go. Please."

733
00:35:06,384 --> 00:35:08,518
- Alice, what did you do?
- Nothing.

734
00:35:08,553 --> 00:35:11,254
I can't do magic, remember?
I'm stuck inside you.

735
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:13,089
So you did it.

736
00:35:14,759 --> 00:35:16,726
I believe you called to me

737
00:35:16,761 --> 00:35:18,828
with something personal,

738
00:35:18,864 --> 00:35:23,166
at the place of my transformation.

739
00:35:24,202 --> 00:35:25,768
The music you got wrong.

740
00:35:25,804 --> 00:35:27,370
Ponderous.

741
00:35:27,405 --> 00:35:29,339
Ah, but the birds.

742
00:35:29,374 --> 00:35:31,007
I did love those.

743
00:35:31,042 --> 00:35:32,008
All my life,

744
00:35:32,043 --> 00:35:36,212
I thought them God's most perfect

745
00:35:36,248 --> 00:35:37,614
works of art.

746
00:35:37,649 --> 00:35:39,015
Just look at them.

747
00:35:42,387 --> 00:35:43,753
Bit annoying, though.

748
00:35:43,788 --> 00:35:45,922
All that cooing.

749
00:35:45,957 --> 00:35:47,757
Now,

750
00:35:47,792 --> 00:35:50,360
why did you summon me?

751
00:35:50,395 --> 00:35:52,262
Or didn't you mean to do that?

752
00:35:52,297 --> 00:35:53,863
Maybe it was you.

753
00:35:55,233 --> 00:35:56,299
You can see me.

754
00:35:56,334 --> 00:35:57,534
Of course I can.

755
00:35:57,569 --> 00:36:00,870
What on earth are you doing
inside this boy?

756
00:36:00,906 --> 00:36:03,206
Friar Joseph, I...
I've been searching for you.

757
00:36:03,241 --> 00:36:05,942
I need your help. With him.

758
00:36:05,977 --> 00:36:10,146
This crushable little field mouse?

759
00:36:10,181 --> 00:36:12,715
Seni baglamak. I bind you.

760
00:36:12,751 --> 00:36:14,817
Seni baglamak. I bind you!

761
00:36:16,922 --> 00:36:18,388
Silly boy.

762
00:36:18,423 --> 00:36:21,457
I can't be boxed.

763
00:36:24,093 --> 00:36:26,370
I read about you.

764
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:28,692
Priests studying magic
till they've gone too far

765
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,661
that their brothers have to box them.

766
00:36:31,009 --> 00:36:33,009
Except sometimes
the boxing doesn't go right.

767
00:36:33,045 --> 00:36:36,680
Yes, the occasional
niffin did slip through.

768
00:36:36,715 --> 00:36:37,948
That's what I thought.

769
00:36:37,983 --> 00:36:40,116
Until I figured out that

770
00:36:40,152 --> 00:36:42,786
it wasn't a handful
who escaped, it was just you.

771
00:36:42,821 --> 00:36:45,522
You slipped away over and over again

772
00:36:45,557 --> 00:36:47,958
because you figured out how to do it.

773
00:36:47,993 --> 00:36:50,493
You can't be boxed.

774
00:36:50,529 --> 00:36:52,195
I need you to teach me.

775
00:36:52,231 --> 00:36:53,797
- Al...
- Will you make him shut up?

776
00:36:53,832 --> 00:36:55,932
- I can do anything in here.
- No, I won't...

777
00:37:00,372 --> 00:37:01,571
I'll do anything.

778
00:37:01,607 --> 00:37:03,106
I'm serious.

779
00:37:09,915 --> 00:37:11,081
Shit.

780
00:37:11,116 --> 00:37:12,382
Let him go, if he passes out

781
00:37:12,417 --> 00:37:14,251
I won't be able to talk to you anymore.

782
00:37:18,757 --> 00:37:20,390
Please show me how you do it.

783
00:37:20,425 --> 00:37:23,627
I've been like this for six centuries.

784
00:37:23,662 --> 00:37:25,395
The things that I know now

785
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:27,030
you cannot imagine.

786
00:37:27,065 --> 00:37:28,431
That's what I want.

787
00:37:29,801 --> 00:37:31,234
Please, can I go with you?

788
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:33,303
You? With me?

789
00:37:35,874 --> 00:37:39,409
You can't even get out of
this shoddy little Magician.

790
00:37:39,444 --> 00:37:42,646
How smart, how able could you be?

791
00:37:42,681 --> 00:37:47,083
How could you help me
with anything worthwhile?

792
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:48,918
Listen to me, it's not that simple.

793
00:37:48,954 --> 00:37:50,920
But it is.

794
00:37:50,956 --> 00:37:52,756
Free yourself.

795
00:37:52,791 --> 00:37:54,457
But I can't. The... the trap is...

796
00:37:54,493 --> 00:37:56,426
Find a way.

797
00:37:56,461 --> 00:37:58,161
Then find me.

798
00:37:58,196 --> 00:38:00,930
Then I will show you a secret or two.

799
00:38:00,966 --> 00:38:02,932
Because then you'll have proven

800
00:38:02,968 --> 00:38:03,933
that you deserve to know them.

801
00:38:03,969 --> 00:38:05,001
Please.

802
00:38:05,037 --> 00:38:06,303
Thanks for the birds.

803
00:38:07,973 --> 00:38:10,173
- Alice...
- No-no-no-no-no-no-no!

804
00:38:10,208 --> 00:38:11,308
Alice, we can talk about this...

805
00:38:11,343 --> 00:38:12,676
Just shut up! Shut up!

806
00:38:12,711 --> 00:38:14,678
Shut up!

807
00:38:14,713 --> 00:38:16,279
The sound of your voice,

808
00:38:16,315 --> 00:38:18,615
your breath, your body,
your mind, your weakness,

809
00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:19,650
I can't stand it.

810
00:38:19,685 --> 00:38:20,884
Stop it.

811
00:38:26,992 --> 00:38:28,792
Did you do that on purpose?

812
00:38:28,827 --> 00:38:30,827
No.

813
00:38:30,862 --> 00:38:31,961
Then wha...

814
00:38:31,997 --> 00:38:33,063
You know what this is.

815
00:38:33,098 --> 00:38:36,633
This is your body trying
to hold a niffin inside it.

816
00:38:36,668 --> 00:38:37,867
You can't.

817
00:38:37,903 --> 00:38:39,469
Not for much longer.

818
00:38:39,504 --> 00:38:41,271
Or it's gonna kill us both.

819
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,847
Well? Did it work?

820
00:39:23,882 --> 00:39:25,014
No. But...

821
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:26,850
Well, then, get out.

822
00:39:30,055 --> 00:39:31,388
Okay, look.

823
00:39:31,423 --> 00:39:32,489
It's gonna be okay.

824
00:39:32,524 --> 00:39:34,691
I'm pregnant.

825
00:39:34,726 --> 00:39:37,427
We're about to go into war.
We need the king.

826
00:39:37,462 --> 00:39:40,029
I need my husband.

827
00:39:40,065 --> 00:39:42,132
Well, you got me.

828
00:39:42,167 --> 00:39:45,201
I'm gonna take care of you and the kid.

829
00:39:45,237 --> 00:39:48,471
I will untangle this war shit somehow.

830
00:39:48,507 --> 00:39:51,040
I know the High King has the power,

831
00:39:51,076 --> 00:39:54,944
but I will hunt Ember
to the ends of the world

832
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:58,348
to have that stupid rule rewritten.

833
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:02,986
Everything El promised,

834
00:40:03,021 --> 00:40:04,888
I'm gonna deliver.

835
00:40:04,923 --> 00:40:06,122
You hear me?

836
00:40:06,158 --> 00:40:07,957
Yes.

837
00:40:07,993 --> 00:40:10,093
Listen to High King Bambi.

838
00:40:11,096 --> 00:40:13,129
You're alive.

839
00:40:15,267 --> 00:40:17,967
Nice of you to join us, asshole.

840
00:40:20,439 --> 00:40:23,306
Really does sound like
you got it all handled.

841
00:40:23,341 --> 00:40:24,908
I do.

842
00:40:24,943 --> 00:40:28,144
But it's more fun with you.

843
00:40:30,949 --> 00:40:33,082
From "The Book of Dana Wallens."

844
00:40:36,988 --> 00:40:39,088
"His adoptive mother christened him

845
00:40:39,124 --> 00:40:41,157
John Spencer Gaines."

846
00:40:41,193 --> 00:40:42,859
Oh, my God.

847
00:40:42,894 --> 00:40:44,027
You found his name.

848
00:40:44,062 --> 00:40:45,528
Stole, technically.

849
00:40:45,564 --> 00:40:48,865
But I think The Librarian
might let it slide

850
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,267
since now I'm an employee.

851
00:40:51,303 --> 00:40:53,203
Wait... you...

852
00:40:53,238 --> 00:40:55,104
you signed that insane contract?

853
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,140
Yeah, it's okay.

854
00:40:56,174 --> 00:40:57,941
How the hell is that okay?

855
00:40:57,976 --> 00:41:00,276
Because I get magic back.

856
00:41:00,312 --> 00:41:03,780
Least the Order's upfront
about what shit costs.

857
00:41:03,815 --> 00:41:06,115
Plus, the way I see it,
I should already be dead by now.

858
00:41:06,151 --> 00:41:08,051
You know? So this is all bonus.

859
00:41:08,086 --> 00:41:11,287
Who gives a shit about all that future.

860
00:41:11,323 --> 00:41:13,523
Did you do this for me?

861
00:41:13,558 --> 00:41:16,059
Well, not just, but...

862
00:41:16,094 --> 00:41:18,027
yeah. You know, yeah, I did.

863
00:41:18,063 --> 00:41:19,963
Were you not listening to a word I said?

864
00:41:19,998 --> 00:41:21,231
Yeah, I was listening.

865
00:41:21,266 --> 00:41:22,499
But guess what, it's not up to you

866
00:41:22,534 --> 00:41:25,134
to decide if you're worth my time.

867
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:28,037
I get to do whatever the fuck
I want with it,

868
00:41:28,073 --> 00:41:29,038
even if it is spend it on a girl

869
00:41:29,074 --> 00:41:31,307
that threatens to bail
all the goddamn time.

870
00:41:31,343 --> 00:41:33,243
'Cause guess what, Kady?

871
00:41:33,278 --> 00:41:36,145
I didn't think I was ever
gonna fucking see you again.

872
00:41:36,181 --> 00:41:37,914
And that puts shit into perspective.

873
00:41:40,252 --> 00:41:42,051
I love you.

874
00:41:42,087 --> 00:41:43,987
Okay? Deal.

875
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:48,391
Shit.

876
00:41:55,033 --> 00:41:57,267
Okay, enough.

877
00:41:57,302 --> 00:41:59,102
What the fuck?

878
00:41:59,137 --> 00:42:00,837
- Can we do this another time?
- No.

879
00:42:00,872 --> 00:42:02,305
First your mind was weird,

880
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:05,508
then it got locked up,
and now you're bleeding.

881
00:42:05,544 --> 00:42:07,010
Are you high? Are you possessed?

882
00:42:07,045 --> 00:42:09,012
- What's...
- Why do you care?

883
00:42:09,047 --> 00:42:10,613
Because

884
00:42:10,649 --> 00:42:12,282
like it or not,

885
00:42:12,317 --> 00:42:14,183
we're the closest thing
you have to friends.

886
00:42:17,889 --> 00:42:20,957
Yeah, glass jaw. Not a surprise.

887
00:42:20,992 --> 00:42:23,593
Don't look at me. Incept him.

888
00:42:23,628 --> 00:42:26,996
I'll give it to you, you're practical.

889
00:42:33,338 --> 00:42:34,938
Get out of here! Right now!

890
00:42:37,576 --> 00:42:38,898
Alice is in there!

891
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:40,310
What? I don't understand.

892
00:42:40,345 --> 00:42:42,889
Neither do I, but she's in there
and she just tried to kill me!

893
00:42:42,914 --> 00:42:44,880
Okay, well, what the hell should we do?

894
