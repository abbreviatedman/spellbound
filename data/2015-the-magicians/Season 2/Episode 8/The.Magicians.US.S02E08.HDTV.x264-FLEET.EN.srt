1
00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:01,750
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:01,864 --> 00:00:05,279
The High King and I
hereby declare war

3
00:00:05,399 --> 00:00:06,966
on the Kingdom of Loria.

4
00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:10,536
One cannot simply take back
a declaration of war.

5
00:00:10,571 --> 00:00:13,372
My hands can't
cast spells anymore.

6
00:00:13,407 --> 00:00:15,741
<i>Help me, I do what I can.</i>

7
00:00:15,776 --> 00:00:17,409
I'm a member of the Order,

8
00:00:17,445 --> 00:00:19,578
the keepers of The Libraries
of the Neitherlands,

9
00:00:19,614 --> 00:00:20,579
the greatest repository
of knowledge.

10
00:00:20,615 --> 00:00:22,815
<i>You're a niffin.</i>

11
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:25,284
<i>Q, I'm not blood-thirsty,
I just want to be free.</i>

12
00:00:25,319 --> 00:00:26,319
Penny!

13
00:00:26,354 --> 00:00:27,720
<i>We're getting you out!</i>

14
00:00:27,755 --> 00:00:29,989
I guess I could help,
for a price.

15
00:00:30,024 --> 00:00:31,624
I want to drive.

16
00:00:31,659 --> 00:00:33,759
For an hour a day,
I get control of your body.

17
00:00:33,794 --> 00:00:34,927
Fine, it's a deal.

18
00:00:34,962 --> 00:00:36,362
<i>We're gonna make another you.</i>

19
00:00:36,397 --> 00:00:39,431
<i>You sleep here, your mind
goes into the golem.</i>

20
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:43,169
Eliot!

21
00:00:43,204 --> 00:00:44,904
In the center of your being,

22
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:46,906
there's a tiny beating heart.

23
00:00:46,941 --> 00:00:48,807
<i>It's called "a Shade."</i>

24
00:00:48,843 --> 00:00:50,543
<i>It's what makes you feel.</i>

25
00:00:50,578 --> 00:00:53,245
<i>The pain will burn you
till there's nothing.</i>

26
00:00:53,281 --> 00:00:54,847
It's Reynard, he's back.

27
00:00:54,882 --> 00:00:55,981
He hurt you too, didn't he?

28
00:00:56,017 --> 00:00:57,516
My child is safe.

29
00:00:57,552 --> 00:00:59,685
He'll never know
who he really is.

30
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,353
<i>The test was positive.</i>

31
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,490
<i>You will need to find a Mudang.</i>

32
00:01:04,525 --> 00:01:06,358
But you can abort it, right?

33
00:01:06,394 --> 00:01:07,927
This is exorcism.

34
00:01:07,962 --> 00:01:10,196
That thing is not human.

35
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:12,998
Did it work?
Is it gone?

36
00:01:13,034 --> 00:01:16,535
But, Julia,
there was a complication.

37
00:01:21,642 --> 00:01:23,542
<i>What do you mean,
lost her Shade?</i>

38
00:01:23,578 --> 00:01:26,679
When the Mudang
cut the demigod's soul out,

39
00:01:26,714 --> 00:01:31,050
they--they nicked hers
by accident.

40
00:01:31,085 --> 00:01:33,552
Her Shade,

41
00:01:33,588 --> 00:01:36,288
it's gone.

42
00:01:36,324 --> 00:01:39,225
Is she gonna be, like...

43
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,627
Honestly, I--

44
00:01:41,662 --> 00:01:43,495
I don't know.

45
00:01:49,604 --> 00:01:52,037
Good morning.

46
00:01:52,073 --> 00:01:53,405
Hey, Jesus,

47
00:01:53,441 --> 00:01:54,974
what day is it?

48
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:56,308
It's Friday.

49
00:01:56,344 --> 00:01:57,810
Are you...

50
00:01:57,845 --> 00:02:00,546
Listen, I just want to thank you

51
00:02:00,581 --> 00:02:02,915
for everything you did
to help me.

52
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:06,018
You're looking at me
like I'm crazy.

53
00:02:07,588 --> 00:02:09,321
I mean, are you?

54
00:02:09,357 --> 00:02:11,490
How do you feel?

55
00:02:11,525 --> 00:02:12,925
How do I feel?

56
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,661
I feel light.

57
00:02:15,696 --> 00:02:18,831
Like a million pound weight's
off my chest.

58
00:02:20,701 --> 00:02:21,934
Come.

59
00:02:21,969 --> 00:02:23,769
So what'd you get?

60
00:02:23,804 --> 00:02:25,437
Anything that skins foxes?

61
00:02:25,473 --> 00:02:27,539
Well--

62
00:02:27,575 --> 00:02:29,408
so back in the day,

63
00:02:29,443 --> 00:02:31,443
Zeus and his little frat bros,

64
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:33,946
they ran around
kidnapping and raping

65
00:02:33,981 --> 00:02:35,948
with total impunity,
so the Magicians,

66
00:02:35,983 --> 00:02:38,784
they read these spells
to protect their communities,

67
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:40,953
God-killing spells.

68
00:02:40,988 --> 00:02:43,856
The one thing that
they all have in common is

69
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:46,125
they all failed.

70
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,595
Maybe it just can't be done.

71
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,697
You know what?
We need to write our own.

72
00:02:51,732 --> 00:02:54,033
We can use these, there's
some pretty big holes, but--

73
00:02:54,068 --> 00:02:56,068
I mean, a little ambitious.

74
00:02:56,103 --> 00:02:58,437
We need to be ambitious,

75
00:02:58,472 --> 00:03:01,373
like Martin Chatwin facing
Ember and Umber ambitious.

76
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:02,941
It can be done.

77
00:03:02,977 --> 00:03:05,611
But, you know, say
we get the perfect spell,

78
00:03:05,646 --> 00:03:07,913
think about the energy
it'd take to work it.

79
00:03:07,948 --> 00:03:09,815
- Right.
- See, Dana knew that.

80
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,083
She had her power source.

81
00:03:11,118 --> 00:03:14,720
We--I--got rid of mine.

82
00:03:14,755 --> 00:03:16,722
Well, what about
Ember in Fillory,

83
00:03:16,757 --> 00:03:17,723
didn't he help Alice?

84
00:03:17,758 --> 00:03:19,625
He's completely AWOL.

85
00:03:21,362 --> 00:03:23,062
Oh, my God.

86
00:03:23,097 --> 00:03:25,998
Dana's baby, Reynard's son.

87
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:27,966
And there is a ton
of lore on demigods.

88
00:03:28,002 --> 00:03:29,635
They're powerful
in their own right.

89
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,404
Dana was talking
like he's still out there.

90
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,007
We need to find him.

91
00:03:39,947 --> 00:03:42,081
Hurry up.

92
00:03:42,116 --> 00:03:44,083
I checked your work, it's fine.

93
00:03:44,118 --> 00:03:45,651
Nothing can break
a Word As Bond.

94
00:03:45,686 --> 00:03:47,586
I must've overlooked something.

95
00:03:47,621 --> 00:03:50,089
No hurting anyone.
No casting magic.

96
00:03:50,124 --> 00:03:51,557
No sex.

97
00:03:51,592 --> 00:03:54,526
Trust me, you locked down
any possible fun.

98
00:03:54,562 --> 00:03:57,096
I held up my end of the deal, Q.

99
00:03:57,131 --> 00:03:58,597
Now it's your turn.

100
00:03:58,632 --> 00:04:00,099
Or box me now

101
00:04:00,134 --> 00:04:03,102
'cause I'll drive you insane.

102
00:04:29,997 --> 00:04:32,097
Midnight, my turn.
Got it?

103
00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:37,703
<i>Quentin!
Where the hell are you?</i>

104
00:04:37,738 --> 00:04:40,139
I'm just glad we managed
to sneak the golem out.

105
00:04:40,174 --> 00:04:44,209
Is it me or is morgue security
ridiculously lax?

106
00:04:44,245 --> 00:04:47,713
Well, I think stealing corpses
isn't generally a thing.

107
00:04:47,748 --> 00:04:49,581
Should be.
Kind of fun.

108
00:04:49,617 --> 00:04:51,383
Anyway, according the Healer,

109
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,252
the Bridge should take
a few days to enchant.

110
00:04:53,287 --> 00:04:55,487
Then his consciousness
can travel it

111
00:04:55,523 --> 00:04:57,856
from the clay back to his body.

112
00:04:59,093 --> 00:05:01,427
And there's that.

113
00:05:01,462 --> 00:05:03,562
Magic brownout.
Wellspring.

114
00:05:03,597 --> 00:05:04,396
Not helping.

115
00:05:04,432 --> 00:05:05,898
How often does that happen?

116
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:08,066
Lately?
Sometimes twice a week.

117
00:05:08,102 --> 00:05:10,035
Sometimes twice an hour.

118
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,904
Affects anything
that draws current.

119
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:14,406
Completely jacks all spellwork.

120
00:05:14,442 --> 00:05:16,742
We're still trying to fix it.

121
00:05:16,777 --> 00:05:19,077
Shall we go see the patient?

122
00:05:28,622 --> 00:05:30,789
How's it going?

123
00:05:30,825 --> 00:05:32,624
Every time the magic stutters,

124
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,461
they have to start
the enchantment over.

125
00:05:35,496 --> 00:05:37,529
Enchant faster.

126
00:05:37,565 --> 00:05:40,098
Yes, Your Majesty.

127
00:05:40,134 --> 00:05:42,734
Is there anything else
that we can be doing?

128
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:44,636
Hold off the war till he's back.

129
00:05:45,606 --> 00:05:47,606
I had a pigeon
drop a confusion spell

130
00:05:47,641 --> 00:05:50,943
on the Lorian castle so
they're moving slow about now.

131
00:05:50,978 --> 00:05:52,544
How can I help?

132
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,147
Honestly?

133
00:05:55,182 --> 00:05:58,250
You can go back to Brakebills
and check on Julia.

134
00:05:58,285 --> 00:06:00,252
You know you want to.

135
00:06:00,287 --> 00:06:02,054
If anything changes--

136
00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:05,057
I'll enchant a two-way mirror
to Brakebills,

137
00:06:05,092 --> 00:06:06,725
like when Rupert yelled at Jane

138
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,760
through the vanity table
in the books.

139
00:06:11,532 --> 00:06:13,832
Hey,

140
00:06:13,868 --> 00:06:16,168
don't worry.

141
00:06:16,203 --> 00:06:19,738
My takeaway lately
is that anything can happen

142
00:06:19,773 --> 00:06:22,107
at any time.

143
00:06:22,142 --> 00:06:24,676
So just be there
for your friend while you can.

144
00:06:27,982 --> 00:06:29,281
Here.

145
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,791
Hey.

146
00:06:39,827 --> 00:06:40,859
Hey.

147
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,261
How is she?

148
00:06:42,296 --> 00:06:44,162
Oh, well, she's...

149
00:06:44,198 --> 00:06:46,665
Holy shit.

150
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,667
That infomatrixing spell

151
00:06:48,702 --> 00:06:50,836
worked like a motherfucker.

152
00:06:50,871 --> 00:06:52,905
- Oh, hey, Q.
- Hey.

153
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,941
So I found a hospital
outside of Hoboken

154
00:06:55,976 --> 00:06:57,709
that took in
a surrendered newborn

155
00:06:57,745 --> 00:07:00,279
August 20, 1976.

156
00:07:00,314 --> 00:07:02,147
Holy shit.

157
00:07:09,156 --> 00:07:11,523
- Jules, what are you--
- I have to go.

158
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:13,892
No, you need to
stay behind the wards.

159
00:07:13,928 --> 00:07:15,160
Reynard is--

160
00:07:15,195 --> 00:07:16,995
Reynard could give a shit
about us.

161
00:07:17,031 --> 00:07:17,796
Think.

162
00:07:17,831 --> 00:07:19,731
If he was gonna finish me,

163
00:07:19,767 --> 00:07:20,799
he'd have done it by now.

164
00:07:20,834 --> 00:07:23,201
So let's take advantage of that.

165
00:07:26,407 --> 00:07:28,840
Uh, Jules, no, look,
she's right.

166
00:07:28,876 --> 00:07:30,809
You're safer here.

167
00:07:30,844 --> 00:07:31,977
No offense, Q,

168
00:07:32,012 --> 00:07:33,812
I didn't actually
ask your opinion.

169
00:07:33,847 --> 00:07:35,747
Thanks, though.

170
00:07:35,783 --> 00:07:36,815
Julia, wait.

171
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:49,395
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny
www.addic7ed.com</font>

172
00:07:50,764 --> 00:07:52,397
Hi, Julia.

173
00:07:57,004 --> 00:07:59,404
You thought I'd
forgotten about you?

174
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,105
You seem like the type

175
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,840
to move on quick

176
00:08:01,875 --> 00:08:02,841
when you're finished
with a girl.

177
00:08:03,777 --> 00:08:06,244
Eh, generally.

178
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,213
Unless they're
carrying my child.

179
00:08:12,152 --> 00:08:14,853
I was protecting you.

180
00:08:14,888 --> 00:08:16,188
And what did you go and do,

181
00:08:16,223 --> 00:08:18,023
you little bitch?

182
00:08:18,058 --> 00:08:20,392
Now, Dana

183
00:08:20,427 --> 00:08:22,961
wouldn't tell me
what I wanted to know.

184
00:08:22,997 --> 00:08:26,999
And it got
very, very painful for her.

185
00:08:27,034 --> 00:08:29,101
But you have more

186
00:08:29,136 --> 00:08:31,236
common sense than she does.

187
00:08:31,271 --> 00:08:34,206
Tell me where her son is.

188
00:08:34,241 --> 00:08:35,774
Hm.

189
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:38,710
I don't know.

190
00:08:38,746 --> 00:08:39,911
Mm.

191
00:08:48,489 --> 00:08:49,988
You're different.

192
00:08:50,024 --> 00:08:51,790
Someone's had a little, uh,

193
00:08:51,825 --> 00:08:53,225
Shade amputation.

194
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,093
I like it.

195
00:08:58,465 --> 00:09:00,232
I know you're there.

196
00:09:00,267 --> 00:09:02,467
Boy.

197
00:09:02,503 --> 00:09:03,935
Quentin.

198
00:09:06,106 --> 00:09:07,172
All right, run.

199
00:09:07,207 --> 00:09:09,174
Go on, run.

200
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:11,910
I'll give you a head start.

201
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:20,085
<i>I get it.
You want to keep me safe.</i>

202
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,153
Thank you.

203
00:09:21,188 --> 00:09:23,255
I'm saying, I just can't

204
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,190
sit on my thumbs in Fillory.

205
00:09:25,225 --> 00:09:27,092
Look, you had the thing
before, the Haxenpaxen,

206
00:09:27,127 --> 00:09:29,027
that--that was
making you invisible, right?

207
00:09:29,063 --> 00:09:29,961
So we're in Fillory.

208
00:09:29,997 --> 00:09:31,763
There's a lot
of crazy shit here.

209
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:33,198
So find something else.
Then you can go back.

210
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:34,466
You don't get it.

211
00:09:34,501 --> 00:09:36,001
There isn't time.

212
00:09:36,036 --> 00:09:38,036
Hm.
She's right, Q, there isn't.

213
00:09:38,072 --> 00:09:39,705
It's my turn soon.

214
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,173
Tick tock.

215
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:42,874
Uh, okay, look,

216
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,210
I am going to go back.
I'll help Kady.

217
00:09:45,245 --> 00:09:46,845
We're--we're gonna
keep working.

218
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,280
Margo.

219
00:09:48,315 --> 00:09:50,949
Uh, Julia needs
to stay here for a while.

220
00:09:50,984 --> 00:09:52,451
It's an emergency.

221
00:09:52,486 --> 00:09:54,486
- Fine.
- Thank you.

222
00:09:57,324 --> 00:09:58,857
It's a nice place.

223
00:10:02,896 --> 00:10:03,528
Tick tock.

224
00:10:03,564 --> 00:10:04,830
Oh, shit.

225
00:10:11,238 --> 00:10:13,505
Dude, are you okay?

226
00:10:16,176 --> 00:10:18,910
I'm fine.
Nothing to see here.

227
00:10:20,514 --> 00:10:22,314
Using the gold you procured,

228
00:10:22,349 --> 00:10:24,816
we have been able
to amply fund the infantry.

229
00:10:24,852 --> 00:10:26,318
Now, as for Loria...

230
00:10:26,353 --> 00:10:29,020
Some 8,000 troops
are headed to the border.

231
00:10:29,056 --> 00:10:30,355
So we're totally outnumbered.

232
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,324
Perhaps not.

233
00:10:32,359 --> 00:10:35,827
Our spies have spotted
the Master Magician Illario

234
00:10:35,863 --> 00:10:36,995
at the edge of the woods.

235
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:38,597
That bald illusionist dick

236
00:10:38,632 --> 00:10:40,499
who disappeared
the entire castle?

237
00:10:40,534 --> 00:10:43,368
We suspect he has enhanced
the number of troops

238
00:10:43,403 --> 00:10:44,669
with trickery.

239
00:10:44,705 --> 00:10:47,205
We believe the actual numbers
are under 3,000.

240
00:10:47,241 --> 00:10:48,340
I like those odds.

241
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:51,042
There is also less good news.

242
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:53,345
Said troops
appear to be amassing

243
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,514
at the edge of
the One-Way-Forest.

244
00:10:55,549 --> 00:10:57,582
A forest of intelligent trees.

245
00:10:57,618 --> 00:10:59,451
Yeah, I've read about it.

246
00:10:59,486 --> 00:11:01,353
Jane Chatwin
tried to pass once and--

247
00:11:01,388 --> 00:11:03,622
Uhh, the trees have a

248
00:11:03,657 --> 00:11:05,524
long allegiance with Loria

249
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:09,227
and, begging pardon,
an excessive dislike of Fillory.

250
00:11:09,263 --> 00:11:11,530
Can you move the trees?

251
00:11:11,565 --> 00:11:13,565
They are rooted, Your Highness.

252
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,201
Yeah.
I mean with an ax.

253
00:11:16,236 --> 00:11:18,937
That would be ill advised.
They are the last of their kind.

254
00:11:20,908 --> 00:11:22,007
Her Languidness suggests

255
00:11:22,042 --> 00:11:24,209
violence against
the One-Way-Forest

256
00:11:24,244 --> 00:11:26,144
could cause civil war
here in Fillory.

257
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,612
Well, in the books,
the trees had

258
00:11:27,648 --> 00:11:30,215
some sort of ambassador,
a dryad.

259
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:31,550
You need to negotiate with her.

260
00:11:31,585 --> 00:11:34,352
Your Highness,
we would not advise--

261
00:11:36,256 --> 00:11:38,056
That worked for Jane?

262
00:11:38,091 --> 00:11:39,424
- Sold.
- Great.

263
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:40,392
I'll come with you.

264
00:11:40,427 --> 00:11:43,295
Uhh,
custom strongly dictates that--

265
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,729
Yeah, I don't care.

266
00:11:44,765 --> 00:11:47,399
Look, I know the books
almost as well as Quentin does.

267
00:11:47,434 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm bored.

268
00:11:49,036 --> 00:11:50,836
Let me be a little useful, okay?

269
00:11:50,871 --> 00:11:51,670
Fine.

270
00:11:51,705 --> 00:11:52,637
But I do the talking.

271
00:11:52,673 --> 00:11:55,607
You just stand there
and look vaguely indignant

272
00:11:55,642 --> 00:11:56,975
or whatever.

273
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,610
Let's go.

274
00:12:09,191 --> 00:12:10,352
It wasn't enough.

275
00:12:10,857 --> 00:12:13,191
I need more time.

276
00:12:13,226 --> 00:12:14,559
To do what?

277
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:17,462
None of your business.

278
00:12:17,497 --> 00:12:19,798
Relax, it's nothing.

279
00:12:26,506 --> 00:12:27,572
What?

280
00:12:27,607 --> 00:12:28,847
I like to read.
Is that a crime?

281
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,542
You can't be serious.

282
00:12:30,577 --> 00:12:33,311
I have the right to know
what I've been doing.

283
00:12:33,346 --> 00:12:35,213
Illuminated manuscripts.

284
00:12:35,248 --> 00:12:37,248
I remember this
from Art History.

285
00:12:37,284 --> 00:12:39,417
Yeah.
A-plus for you.

286
00:12:39,453 --> 00:12:41,486
I was just bored.

287
00:12:41,521 --> 00:12:44,088
The monks got tired
of writing the same thing

288
00:12:44,124 --> 00:12:47,659
over and over again so they--

289
00:12:47,694 --> 00:12:49,828
they embellished in the margins.

290
00:12:49,863 --> 00:12:52,397
Well, a lot of priests
dabbled in magic.

291
00:12:52,432 --> 00:12:53,765
Some exploded.

292
00:12:58,438 --> 00:12:59,571
Yeah.

293
00:12:59,606 --> 00:13:01,339
Those monks were drama queens.

294
00:13:01,374 --> 00:13:03,675
Okay.
"There must be another way

295
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:08,179
to bring back our brother"?

296
00:13:08,215 --> 00:13:11,182
Are you looking
for a way to reverse it?

297
00:13:11,218 --> 00:13:14,152
No.
No, Q, I'm not.

298
00:13:14,187 --> 00:13:16,087
Then why are you reading about
all these holy men

299
00:13:16,122 --> 00:13:17,122
trying to fix niffins?

300
00:13:17,157 --> 00:13:18,790
What does it matter, Q?

301
00:13:18,825 --> 00:13:20,124
They always fail.

302
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,593
Alice.

303
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,632
Oh, my God.

304
00:13:33,473 --> 00:13:34,539
Welcome back, Penny.

305
00:13:34,574 --> 00:13:35,473
I need a book.

306
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:37,442
"Future Movements in Magic."

307
00:13:37,477 --> 00:13:40,545
All right.
Follow me.

308
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,380
Don't they have a copy
at Brakebills?

309
00:13:42,415 --> 00:13:43,548
It got destroyed.

310
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:48,152
I figure you guys
have every book here, so.

311
00:13:48,188 --> 00:13:49,721
Unfortunately, you won't be able

312
00:13:49,756 --> 00:13:50,889
to take this off the premises

313
00:13:50,924 --> 00:13:52,891
since you don't
have a library card.

314
00:13:52,926 --> 00:13:55,393
Oh, no-no, I got one, um.

315
00:13:55,428 --> 00:13:57,128
I'm just the errand boy.

316
00:13:57,163 --> 00:13:59,464
Mayakovsky.

317
00:13:59,499 --> 00:14:00,932
I'm surprised
the two of you get along.

318
00:14:00,967 --> 00:14:03,735
No, we don't.
Believe me.

319
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,803
My hands won't cast.

320
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,639
He's the only one
that can help me,

321
00:14:07,674 --> 00:14:09,841
if I finish fetching
his goddamn grocery list

322
00:14:09,876 --> 00:14:11,643
so we can get started, so.

323
00:14:11,678 --> 00:14:12,911
Ah.

324
00:14:12,946 --> 00:14:14,245
I can put a rush on this book.

325
00:14:14,281 --> 00:14:15,680
Thank you.

326
00:14:15,715 --> 00:14:17,682
If you're sure
that's what you really want.

327
00:14:17,717 --> 00:14:19,417
Well, I really want magic,
so, yeah.

328
00:14:19,452 --> 00:14:21,753
But to pay for it with
servitude to a lying drunkard--

329
00:14:21,788 --> 00:14:23,655
What's the alternative?

330
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,189
Us.

331
00:14:25,225 --> 00:14:26,958
You?

332
00:14:26,993 --> 00:14:28,927
Librarians?

333
00:14:28,962 --> 00:14:30,595
The Order of the Library
of the Neitherlands

334
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,497
are Master Magicians.

335
00:14:32,532 --> 00:14:34,432
We can help you, Penny.

336
00:14:34,467 --> 00:14:36,768
'Kay.

337
00:14:36,803 --> 00:14:39,270
What's the catch?

338
00:14:39,306 --> 00:14:41,372
This contract
initiates our services

339
00:14:41,408 --> 00:14:42,273
in exchange for--

340
00:14:42,309 --> 00:14:45,343
Unlimited manual
and magical labor?

341
00:14:45,378 --> 00:14:46,878
Bound in service to the library

342
00:14:46,913 --> 00:14:48,880
up to and after my death,
are you kidding?

343
00:14:48,915 --> 00:14:50,415
All very standard.

344
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:52,450
For a period of no less
than one million years?

345
00:14:52,485 --> 00:14:54,319
Okay, lady, are you joking?

346
00:14:54,354 --> 00:14:55,820
No.

347
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:58,423
Okay.

348
00:15:00,493 --> 00:15:02,226
Okay, here's what Julia found.

349
00:15:02,262 --> 00:15:04,362
August 20, 1976.

350
00:15:04,397 --> 00:15:07,432
Baby surrendered at hospital.

351
00:15:07,467 --> 00:15:09,534
Uh, a nurse, Michelle Walker

352
00:15:09,569 --> 00:15:12,971
transferred it to
a state social worker, uh.

353
00:15:13,006 --> 00:15:15,373
And after that

354
00:15:15,408 --> 00:15:17,375
nothing, there's
no record of adoption or...

355
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,743
Okay, so,

356
00:15:18,778 --> 00:15:20,511
where's Michelle Walker now?

357
00:15:23,717 --> 00:15:25,583
Merciful Sisters Cemetery.

358
00:15:25,619 --> 00:15:27,652
Oh, shit.

359
00:15:27,687 --> 00:15:29,320
Sh.

360
00:15:31,858 --> 00:15:33,324
Shit what?

361
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,060
Just--dead ended again.

362
00:15:36,096 --> 00:15:37,562
How's Mayakovsky?

363
00:15:37,597 --> 00:15:39,364
Oh, still a jerk-off,
you know.

364
00:15:42,435 --> 00:15:44,035
What's wrong with you?

365
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,436
Hm?

366
00:15:45,472 --> 00:15:47,772
Your mind is

367
00:15:47,807 --> 00:15:51,509
- doing something.
- Uh, no, it's not.

368
00:15:51,544 --> 00:15:53,845
He's talking about me, Q.

369
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,279
- Stop that.
- Stop what?

370
00:15:55,315 --> 00:15:57,949
Stop singing Imagine Dragons
to get me off the track.

371
00:15:57,984 --> 00:15:59,884
Lock it up, Q.
Seriously.

372
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:01,686
Look, why are you always
poking around in me anyway?

373
00:16:01,721 --> 00:16:02,787
Can you just leave me alone?

374
00:16:02,822 --> 00:16:03,822
Oh, I'd love to.

375
00:16:03,857 --> 00:16:04,956
You leak, asshole.

376
00:16:04,991 --> 00:16:07,925
Okay.
I have got to, uh...

377
00:16:11,831 --> 00:16:13,064
The hell was that?

378
00:16:13,099 --> 00:16:16,367
Something's wronger than usual.

379
00:16:16,403 --> 00:16:18,770
And he's a grown man.

380
00:16:18,805 --> 00:16:20,538
Moving on.

381
00:16:20,573 --> 00:16:22,040
Have you eaten lately?

382
00:16:22,075 --> 00:16:23,908
You should eat.

383
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:29,480
Penny, we still haven't--

384
00:16:29,516 --> 00:16:30,882
you know,

385
00:16:30,917 --> 00:16:32,884
talked.

386
00:16:34,487 --> 00:16:36,554
Uh, I thought we weren't gonna.

387
00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:39,490
Yeah, well, that was
when this was some quick fun,

388
00:16:39,526 --> 00:16:41,893
not hanging out 24/7

389
00:16:41,928 --> 00:16:44,495
fucking our brains out,
robbing banks.

390
00:16:44,531 --> 00:16:46,564
That is fun.

391
00:16:46,599 --> 00:16:47,665
It's all I need.

392
00:16:48,835 --> 00:16:50,001
Okay, here's the deal.

393
00:16:50,036 --> 00:16:51,969
I can't exactly study magic

394
00:16:52,005 --> 00:16:53,671
unless I sign an insane contract

395
00:16:53,707 --> 00:16:56,340
or Mayakovsky stops
dicking around.

396
00:16:56,376 --> 00:16:58,676
What I can do
is help stop the evil freak

397
00:16:58,712 --> 00:17:00,745
that tried to rip your heart
out of your chest.

398
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,448
I'll sleep better with him dead.
Simple.

399
00:17:03,483 --> 00:17:04,949
You want to
keep things professional?

400
00:17:04,984 --> 00:17:06,250
Fine.

401
00:17:06,286 --> 00:17:07,585
It's no big deal.

402
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,156
Good.

403
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,049
Greetings!

404
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:31,595
I am Margo,
High Queen of Fillory.

405
00:17:33,632 --> 00:17:36,366
<i>Habla Ingles</i> or what?

406
00:17:42,508 --> 00:17:43,840
Hi.

407
00:17:43,876 --> 00:17:45,609
So you the nymph?

408
00:17:45,644 --> 00:17:47,244
Dryad.

409
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:48,678
I thought you were all girls.

410
00:17:48,714 --> 00:17:51,948
Listen, I know your
tree buddies don't like us.

411
00:17:51,984 --> 00:17:53,917
The rulers of Fillory
have a long and tragic

412
00:17:53,952 --> 00:17:55,419
history of arboreal disrespect.

413
00:17:55,454 --> 00:17:56,987
Yeah, okay.

414
00:17:57,022 --> 00:17:58,255
Look, it's a new day.

415
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:00,490
We're a kinder, gentler Fillory.

416
00:18:00,526 --> 00:18:03,493
So we need to settle some unrest
with our Lorian neighbors.

417
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:05,695
Settle unrest.

418
00:18:05,731 --> 00:18:07,030
You mean wage war.

419
00:18:07,066 --> 00:18:08,532
No, we mean

420
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:10,100
button some messy shit up.

421
00:18:10,135 --> 00:18:11,835
Help us here.

422
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,370
We want to make this work.

423
00:18:13,405 --> 00:18:14,371
Respectfully.

424
00:18:14,406 --> 00:18:15,772
That's rich.

425
00:18:15,808 --> 00:18:17,974
Considering your king
apparently wouldn't deign

426
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,943
to come here himself,

427
00:18:19,978 --> 00:18:23,046
sending two females.

428
00:18:23,082 --> 00:18:27,350
Hey, this is Julia.

429
00:18:27,386 --> 00:18:30,353
Royal Ambassador.

430
00:18:30,389 --> 00:18:33,223
And I am Fillory's
one and only High Queen.

431
00:18:33,258 --> 00:18:35,292
Yes.
The insult's been noted.

432
00:18:35,327 --> 00:18:37,060
Passage is denied.

433
00:18:37,096 --> 00:18:38,228
Good day.

434
00:18:41,266 --> 00:18:44,568
Damn it.

435
00:18:44,603 --> 00:18:45,669
Let's go.

436
00:19:00,018 --> 00:19:01,084
Before you ask, no.

437
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,153
No luck with
the adoption records.

438
00:19:03,188 --> 00:19:06,823
No luck with the hospital.
And no luck with the nurse.

439
00:19:06,859 --> 00:19:08,091
What's wrong with you?

440
00:19:08,127 --> 00:19:09,993
Your wards are airtight.

441
00:19:10,028 --> 00:19:11,061
You complained, so I fixed them.

442
00:19:11,096 --> 00:19:13,497
Since when are you
that good at fixing anything?

443
00:19:13,532 --> 00:19:15,332
Can we agree that I lose
no matter what I say,

444
00:19:15,367 --> 00:19:16,399
and just stop talking?

445
00:19:16,435 --> 00:19:19,002
So Reynard's kid.

446
00:19:19,037 --> 00:19:20,270
Yeah, so,

447
00:19:20,305 --> 00:19:21,605
the trail stops
when the nurse dies.

448
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,039
Shit.

449
00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:26,176
If only there was a way
to literally see into the past.

450
00:19:26,211 --> 00:19:27,711
You know, I think
I just remembered

451
00:19:27,746 --> 00:19:28,945
there might be a way.

452
00:19:28,981 --> 00:19:31,214
Yeah, time bridge.
We thought of that.

453
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,449
There's nothing close enough.

454
00:19:32,484 --> 00:19:33,717
No, uh,

455
00:19:33,752 --> 00:19:35,919
time sight, literally.

456
00:19:35,954 --> 00:19:37,354
We never studied that.

457
00:19:37,389 --> 00:19:40,257
Uh, no, but I think Alice did.

458
00:19:40,292 --> 00:19:42,259
Hmm, uh, can't remember.

459
00:19:42,294 --> 00:19:43,593
Did she or didn't she?

460
00:19:43,629 --> 00:19:44,928
She did, uh.

461
00:19:44,963 --> 00:19:46,463
I think it was

462
00:19:46,498 --> 00:19:49,266
uh, uh, extra reading

463
00:19:49,301 --> 00:19:51,201
in Metageology?

464
00:19:51,236 --> 00:19:52,169
- Nope.
- Nope.

465
00:19:52,204 --> 00:19:54,871
Um, oh, I think,
or, it was an elective

466
00:19:54,907 --> 00:19:57,140
in, uh, Basics in
Vedic Prognostication.

467
00:19:57,176 --> 00:19:59,276
- Nope.
- Nope. Um.

468
00:19:59,311 --> 00:20:01,311
Give me an extra hour tonight
and I'll tell you.

469
00:20:01,346 --> 00:20:02,312
Hm.

470
00:20:02,347 --> 00:20:03,713
Was it, uh, something we learned

471
00:20:03,749 --> 00:20:06,082
in Sunderland's class, I mean,
'cause we never studied--

472
00:20:06,118 --> 00:20:08,051
Are you, like,

473
00:20:08,086 --> 00:20:10,420
having an ADD moment
right now, or?

474
00:20:10,455 --> 00:20:12,455
No--it--um--

475
00:20:12,491 --> 00:20:13,390
Okay, so here's the thing.

476
00:20:13,425 --> 00:20:15,258
Um, there's this one time,

477
00:20:15,294 --> 00:20:16,593
Alice and I, right?

478
00:20:16,628 --> 00:20:17,994
We were studying;

479
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:20,497
we were sharing lab materials.

480
00:20:20,532 --> 00:20:21,631
And people didn't
know this about Alice,

481
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:23,967
but she was really greedy

482
00:20:24,002 --> 00:20:25,902
with her lab materials.

483
00:20:25,938 --> 00:20:27,470
Um, and

484
00:20:27,506 --> 00:20:30,240
so she would offer to help me
for extra time with them--

485
00:20:30,275 --> 00:20:32,275
None of this
is interesting to any of us.

486
00:20:32,311 --> 00:20:33,311
The point is

487
00:20:33,345 --> 00:20:36,580
I would say 20 extra minutes,

488
00:20:36,615 --> 00:20:38,415
one time offer,

489
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:39,516
take it or leave it.

490
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,650
30.

491
00:20:40,686 --> 00:20:43,620
Fine. Deal.

492
00:20:43,655 --> 00:20:45,088
Is how that would go.

493
00:20:45,123 --> 00:20:47,090
In a nutshell.

494
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:48,158
Phosphoromancy.

495
00:20:48,193 --> 00:20:50,327
My discipline, idiot.

496
00:20:50,362 --> 00:20:53,096
McKellan's got a scope that
can bend light into the past.

497
00:20:53,131 --> 00:20:56,099
Phosphoromancy.

498
00:20:56,134 --> 00:20:57,667
Ugh.
I'm an idiot.

499
00:20:57,703 --> 00:20:58,703
Correct.

500
00:20:58,737 --> 00:21:01,004
Shut up, I--remembered.

501
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,706
Uh, okay, so

502
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:05,542
the viewing device, it's
in Professor McKellan's office.

503
00:21:05,577 --> 00:21:07,510
Ooh, Penny.

504
00:21:07,546 --> 00:21:10,146
See, even he can't wait
to get away from you.

505
00:21:12,751 --> 00:21:15,118
Is this thing gonna work or not?

506
00:21:15,153 --> 00:21:17,320
Eliot has shit to do.

507
00:21:17,356 --> 00:21:20,023
He has to do the work
of crossing back.

508
00:21:20,058 --> 00:21:22,225
Not everyone chooses to do so.

509
00:21:22,261 --> 00:21:25,528
Okay.
Can you step out for a minute?

510
00:21:25,564 --> 00:21:27,597
Fen, you too, sweetie.

511
00:21:35,173 --> 00:21:37,974
Eliot,

512
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:41,645
you need to come back.

513
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,048
I know that you have
a constant low-key death wish,

514
00:21:45,083 --> 00:21:48,652
but you can't leave.

515
00:21:48,687 --> 00:21:50,587
They don't want me.

516
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,723
They want the High King.

517
00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:07,337
I'm faking it, El.

518
00:22:10,275 --> 00:22:13,677
So if you could just

519
00:22:13,712 --> 00:22:16,313
please,

520
00:22:16,348 --> 00:22:19,482
please, wake up.

521
00:22:31,463 --> 00:22:34,431
I set it to August 20, 1976.

522
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,437
Holy shit.

523
00:22:42,774 --> 00:22:43,907
What, what do you see?

524
00:22:43,942 --> 00:22:45,408
Uh, just

525
00:22:45,444 --> 00:22:46,910
people waiting.

526
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,053
Oh, here we go.

527
00:22:57,089 --> 00:22:58,555
What?

528
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:01,658
A nurse with a baby.

529
00:23:10,836 --> 00:23:12,635
Uh.

530
00:23:12,671 --> 00:23:15,505
What?

531
00:23:17,976 --> 00:23:19,476
You got to be kidding me.

532
00:23:19,511 --> 00:23:21,177
What?

533
00:23:21,213 --> 00:23:22,245
What's wrong?

534
00:23:26,518 --> 00:23:29,519
Ah, shit.

535
00:23:29,554 --> 00:23:30,787
Dana did this.

536
00:23:30,822 --> 00:23:32,689
To protect the baby's identity,

537
00:23:32,724 --> 00:23:35,692
even from spells
40 years in the future.

538
00:23:35,727 --> 00:23:39,963
She thought of everything.

539
00:23:39,998 --> 00:23:41,645
And back to square nothing.

540
00:24:07,373 --> 00:24:08,272
Hi.

541
00:24:08,308 --> 00:24:10,007
I'm Julia.

542
00:24:10,043 --> 00:24:11,509
God, been waiting hours

543
00:24:11,544 --> 00:24:13,411
for you to get
close enough to grab.

544
00:24:13,446 --> 00:24:15,112
I think my foot fell asleep.

545
00:24:15,148 --> 00:24:16,948
I will never help Fillory.

546
00:24:16,983 --> 00:24:18,082
I'd sooner be skinned.

547
00:24:18,117 --> 00:24:20,017
All right, boys, let him go.

548
00:24:20,053 --> 00:24:22,286
Give us some air,
but stay close-ish.

549
00:24:24,757 --> 00:24:26,357
Hate Fillory all you want.

550
00:24:26,392 --> 00:24:27,692
I'm here for one thing,

551
00:24:27,727 --> 00:24:29,393
and then I'm off this planet.

552
00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:31,262
An invisibility spell

553
00:24:31,297 --> 00:24:34,365
strong enough
to hide from a god.

554
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,433
And why should I give it to you?

555
00:24:35,468 --> 00:24:38,135
Because I may not
give a shit about Fillory.

556
00:24:38,171 --> 00:24:40,471
But I do,
as its Royal Ambassador,

557
00:24:40,506 --> 00:24:43,574
have access to
its guards and its dungeons.

558
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:46,544
And I'll use A
to throw you in B,

559
00:24:46,579 --> 00:24:49,046
but help me,
and I'll let you go free.

560
00:24:49,082 --> 00:24:50,214
I don't believe you.

561
00:24:50,249 --> 00:24:51,282
Your loyalty will always
lie with--

562
00:24:51,317 --> 00:24:52,750
With me.

563
00:24:52,785 --> 00:24:55,052
My loyalty will
always lie with me.

564
00:25:21,781 --> 00:25:24,315
Drill a hole in it.
Wear it.

565
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,516
No god can sense you.

566
00:25:25,551 --> 00:25:28,285
Thank you.

567
00:25:28,321 --> 00:25:30,321
You're free to go.

568
00:25:39,298 --> 00:25:41,132
Hey, dryad boy!

569
00:25:42,201 --> 00:25:45,469
Come on out.
I saw you in there, sweetheart.

570
00:25:49,308 --> 00:25:51,709
Negotiations are over.

571
00:25:51,744 --> 00:25:53,444
Go home.

572
00:25:53,479 --> 00:25:56,147
I brought you something.

573
00:25:58,918 --> 00:26:00,618
A small token of peace.

574
00:26:00,653 --> 00:26:01,886
It won't change anything.

575
00:26:01,921 --> 00:26:04,221
Just give it to your bosses.

576
00:26:04,257 --> 00:26:06,490
I'm trying to fix this.

577
00:26:16,335 --> 00:26:17,601
Thank you.

578
00:26:58,945 --> 00:27:00,578
I've been looking for you.

579
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:07,118
You've lived here since
the Bush administration,

580
00:27:07,153 --> 00:27:08,886
but you're
thousands of years old.

581
00:27:12,225 --> 00:27:15,259
You're an AnglerBeast.

582
00:27:15,294 --> 00:27:16,794
That's stupid.

583
00:27:16,829 --> 00:27:18,896
You play too much
Dungeons and Dragons.

584
00:27:21,501 --> 00:27:24,702
You knew a man, a long time ago.

585
00:27:24,737 --> 00:27:26,904
He was special and
he lived in a monastery,

586
00:27:26,939 --> 00:27:28,939
a Master Magician.

587
00:27:28,975 --> 00:27:31,475
Friar Joseph.

588
00:27:31,511 --> 00:27:32,810
Ring a bell?

589
00:27:36,949 --> 00:27:39,150
I want to know
everything about him.

590
00:27:39,185 --> 00:27:42,653
Well, in the parlance
of your time,

591
00:27:42,688 --> 00:27:45,890
fuck you, pay me.

592
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,727
Fresh meat.

593
00:27:49,762 --> 00:27:52,897
Newborns are the sweetest.

594
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,668
You know, I thought
about doing that,

595
00:27:57,703 --> 00:27:59,904
but my time is very limited.

596
00:27:59,939 --> 00:28:03,908
So I researched
your weak spots instead.

597
00:28:03,943 --> 00:28:05,943
And you believe what you read?

598
00:28:15,721 --> 00:28:18,622
That was stupid of you.

599
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,003
Oh, my God.

600
00:28:36,008 --> 00:28:37,441
Alice, what did you do?

601
00:28:37,476 --> 00:28:38,943
Relax.

602
00:28:38,978 --> 00:28:42,346
Can't hurt anybody, remember?

603
00:28:42,381 --> 00:28:43,381
But she's--

604
00:28:43,416 --> 00:28:45,382
A monster.

605
00:28:45,418 --> 00:28:46,550
Technically, I did good here.

606
00:28:46,586 --> 00:28:49,787
I mean, there's a ton of
kid bones in this sandbox.

607
00:28:49,822 --> 00:28:53,958
It wasn't cooperating
so I had to use

608
00:28:53,993 --> 00:28:56,627
enhanced
interrogation techniques.

609
00:28:56,662 --> 00:28:58,629
To find out what?

610
00:28:58,664 --> 00:29:01,665
We might want to go before
the rest of it lumbers up here.

611
00:29:01,701 --> 00:29:03,667
It's pretty mad at me.

612
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,074
What the hell
were you thinking, huh?

613
00:29:10,109 --> 00:29:11,809
You burned down
the One-Way-Forest

614
00:29:11,844 --> 00:29:15,312
while I'm trying to
wiggle us out of full-on war?

615
00:29:15,348 --> 00:29:17,481
Those trees were dicks.

616
00:29:17,516 --> 00:29:19,250
They were endangered.

617
00:29:19,285 --> 00:29:21,585
Now trees all over Fillory
are enraged

618
00:29:21,621 --> 00:29:22,453
and calling for action.

619
00:29:22,488 --> 00:29:25,489
Do you have any idea
what you did, Julia?

620
00:29:25,524 --> 00:29:26,890
Yeah.

621
00:29:26,926 --> 00:29:28,559
I helped you.

622
00:29:28,594 --> 00:29:30,027
Now you can cross into Loria

623
00:29:30,062 --> 00:29:32,062
and kick their fucking asses
like you wanted to.

624
00:29:32,098 --> 00:29:34,865
This is not how
I wanted to go about that.

625
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,767
Yeah, I know.

626
00:29:36,802 --> 00:29:38,502
So the really good news is

627
00:29:38,537 --> 00:29:40,504
you didn't do anything.

628
00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:42,339
Go back and tell
the angry tree lobby

629
00:29:42,375 --> 00:29:44,608
it was all crazy Julia.

630
00:29:44,644 --> 00:29:45,509
You're welcome.

631
00:29:45,544 --> 00:29:47,444
Look, I got what I wanted.

632
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,912
The rest was all a favor to you.

633
00:29:48,948 --> 00:29:50,781
So banish me forever.

634
00:29:50,816 --> 00:29:53,017
Send me home.

635
00:29:53,052 --> 00:29:55,552
You know, in a sick way,

636
00:29:55,588 --> 00:29:57,521
I sort of admire you.

637
00:29:57,556 --> 00:29:59,723
That being said,
here's what we do

638
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:02,359
to loose cannons
in Fillory, ready?

639
00:30:03,562 --> 00:30:05,396
Guards!

640
00:30:05,431 --> 00:30:08,299
Take this bitch to the dungeon.

641
00:30:08,334 --> 00:30:09,533
You gotta be kidding me.

642
00:30:09,568 --> 00:30:11,869
Now, if you'll excuse me,

643
00:30:11,904 --> 00:30:13,737
I have some
damage control to do.

644
00:30:18,477 --> 00:30:20,711
How to break a Word As Bond.

645
00:30:23,416 --> 00:30:26,550
Reversing a Word As Bond.

646
00:30:26,585 --> 00:30:28,485
Amending a Word As Bond.

647
00:30:28,521 --> 00:30:30,421
It's not there.

648
00:30:30,456 --> 00:30:33,457
That's the whole point.
You can't break it.

649
00:30:33,492 --> 00:30:35,125
Why don't you
do something useful

650
00:30:35,161 --> 00:30:39,163
and catch up on all the classes
you missed in Fillory?

651
00:30:39,198 --> 00:30:40,564
This isn't working.

652
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:41,599
Yeah, tell me about it.

653
00:30:41,634 --> 00:30:43,567
Keeping you a secret
and trying to help you

654
00:30:43,602 --> 00:30:46,570
while you do God knows what.

655
00:30:46,605 --> 00:30:48,906
I have to ask for help.
I need to tell someone.

656
00:30:48,941 --> 00:30:50,107
Great idea.

657
00:30:50,142 --> 00:30:52,509
You think you know
locked up for crazy?

658
00:30:52,545 --> 00:30:54,078
They'll put you someplace
you can't even imagine.

659
00:30:54,113 --> 00:30:55,913
And they'll box me up so
quick...

660
00:30:55,948 --> 00:30:57,247
all your efforts for nothing.
Is that what you want?

661
00:30:57,283 --> 00:30:59,650
I want Alice back.
I want the real you.

662
00:30:59,685 --> 00:31:02,152
I want--I--

663
00:31:02,188 --> 00:31:04,088
I can't help Fillory.

664
00:31:04,123 --> 00:31:05,422
And I can't help Eliot.

665
00:31:05,458 --> 00:31:06,857
And I can't help Julia.

666
00:31:06,892 --> 00:31:09,326
And I just want to do--

667
00:31:09,362 --> 00:31:11,462
God, one thing for the person
that deserves it the most.

668
00:31:11,497 --> 00:31:14,798
That's what I want.

669
00:31:14,834 --> 00:31:15,999
God.

670
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:20,771
I understand.

671
00:31:23,209 --> 00:31:26,443
Do you want to know the truth?

672
00:31:26,479 --> 00:31:28,345
You are a failure.

673
00:31:28,381 --> 00:31:31,782
So stop using me
to try to fix that.

674
00:31:31,817 --> 00:31:33,617
Uh-oh, look at the time.

675
00:31:33,652 --> 00:31:34,551

- Where are we going?
- Home.

731
00:34:06,834 --> 00:34:08,367
It's done.
We already did it.

732
00:34:08,402 --> 00:34:11,403
Did what?

733
00:34:11,439 --> 00:34:14,974
Alice, what did you do?

734
00:34:15,009 --> 00:34:16,009
Uh,

735
00:34:16,043 --> 00:34:18,911
oh, uh, sir,
where did we just come from?

736
00:34:18,946 --> 00:34:20,546
About three streets that way.

737
00:34:20,581 --> 00:34:22,882
Great.
Can we go back there now?

738
00:34:22,917 --> 00:34:24,717
Right.

739
00:34:24,752 --> 00:34:27,920
Wait, Quentin, no.
I'm serious, don't.

740
00:34:27,955 --> 00:34:29,855
Q, stop.
Hold on.

741
00:34:29,891 --> 00:34:32,925
Q, please, wait.

742
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,860
Please, Quentin, don't.

743
00:34:50,077 --> 00:34:51,510
You...

744
00:34:51,546 --> 00:34:53,779
Tricked you
with reverse psychology?

745
00:34:53,814 --> 00:34:55,414
It was shockingly easy.

746
00:34:55,449 --> 00:34:57,049
"No, don't go.
Please."

747
00:34:57,084 --> 00:34:59,218
- Alice, what did you do?
- Nothing.

748
00:34:59,253 --> 00:35:01,954
I can't do magic, remember?
I'm stuck inside you.

749
00:35:01,989 --> 00:35:03,789
So you did it.

750
00:35:05,459 --> 00:35:07,426
I believe you called to me

751
00:35:07,461 --> 00:35:09,528
with something personal,

752
00:35:09,564 --> 00:35:13,866
at the place of
my transformation.

753
00:35:14,902 --> 00:35:16,468
The music you got wrong.

754
00:35:16,504 --> 00:35:18,070
Ponderous.

755
00:35:18,105 --> 00:35:20,039
Ah, but the birds.

756
00:35:20,074 --> 00:35:21,707
I did love those.

757
00:35:21,742 --> 00:35:22,708
All my life,

758
00:35:22,743 --> 00:35:26,912
I thought them God's
most perfect

759
00:35:26,948 --> 00:35:28,314
works of art.

760
00:35:28,349 --> 00:35:29,715
Just look at them.

761
00:35:33,087 --> 00:35:34,453
Bit annoying, though.

762
00:35:34,488 --> 00:35:36,622
All that cooing.

763
00:35:36,657 --> 00:35:38,457
Now,

764
00:35:38,492 --> 00:35:41,060
why did you summon me?

765
00:35:41,095 --> 00:35:42,962
Or didn't you mean to do that?

766
00:35:42,997 --> 00:35:44,563
Maybe it was you.

767
00:35:45,933 --> 00:35:46,999
You can see me.

768
00:35:47,034 --> 00:35:48,234
Of course I can.

769
00:35:48,269 --> 00:35:51,570
What on earth are you doing
inside this boy?

770
00:35:51,606 --> 00:35:53,906
Friar Joseph, I--
I've been searching for you.

771
00:35:53,941 --> 00:35:56,642
I need your help.
With him.

772
00:35:56,677 --> 00:36:00,846
This crushable
little field mouse?

773
00:36:00,881 --> 00:36:03,415
<i>Seni baglamak.</i>
I bind you.

774
00:36:03,451 --> 00:36:05,517
<i>Seni baglamak.</i>
I bind you!

775
00:36:07,622 --> 00:36:09,088
Silly boy.

776
00:36:09,123 --> 00:36:12,157
I can't be boxed.

777
00:36:12,193 --> 00:36:14,470
I read about you.

778
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,792
Priests studying magic
till they've gone too far

779
00:36:16,828 --> 00:36:18,761
that their brothers
have to box them.

780
00:36:19,109 --> 00:36:21,109
Except sometimes
the boxing doesn't go right.

781
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:24,780
Yes, the occasional
niffin did slip through.

782
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:26,048
That's what I thought.

783
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:28,216
Until I figured out that

784
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:30,886
it wasn't a handful
who escaped, it was just you.

785
00:36:30,921 --> 00:36:33,622
You slipped away
over and over again

786
00:36:33,657 --> 00:36:36,058
because you figured out
how to do it.

787
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:38,593
You can't be boxed.

788
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:40,295
I need you to teach me.

789
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:41,897
- Al--
- Will you make him shut up?

790
00:36:41,932 --> 00:36:44,032
- I can do anything in here.
- No, I won't--

791
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:49,671
I'll do anything.

792
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,206
I'm serious.

793
00:36:58,015 --> 00:36:59,181
Shit.

794
00:36:59,216 --> 00:37:00,482
Let him go, if he passes out

795
00:37:00,517 --> 00:37:02,351
I won't be able
to talk to you anymore.

796
00:37:06,857 --> 00:37:08,490
Please show me how you do it.

797
00:37:08,525 --> 00:37:11,727
I've been like this
for six centuries.

798
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:13,495
The things that I know now

799
00:37:13,530 --> 00:37:15,130
you cannot imagine.

800
00:37:15,165 --> 00:37:16,531
That's what I want.

801
00:37:17,901 --> 00:37:19,334
Please, can I go with you?

802
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,403
You?
With me?

803
00:37:23,974 --> 00:37:27,509
You can't even get out of
this shoddy little Magician.

804
00:37:27,544 --> 00:37:30,746
How smart, how able
could you be?

805
00:37:30,781 --> 00:37:35,183
How could you help me
with anything worthwhile?

806
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:37,018
Listen to me,
it's not that simple.

807
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:39,020
But it is.

808
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:40,856
Free yourself.

809
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:42,557
But I can't.
The--the trap is--

810
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,526
Find a way.

811
00:37:44,561 --> 00:37:46,261
Then find me.

812
00:37:46,296 --> 00:37:49,030
Then I will show you
a secret or two.

813
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:51,032
Because then you'll have proven

814
00:37:51,068 --> 00:37:52,033
that you deserve to know them.

815
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:53,101
Please.

816
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:54,403
Thanks for the birds.

817
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:58,273
- Alice--
- No-no-no-no-no-no-no!

818
00:37:58,308 --> 00:37:59,408
Alice, we can
talk about this--

819
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:00,776
Just shut up!
Shut up!

820
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:02,778
Shut up!

821
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:04,379
The sound of your voice,

822
00:38:04,415 --> 00:38:06,715
your breath, your body,
your mind, your weakness,

823
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:07,750
I can't stand it.

824
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:08,984
Stop it.

825
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:16,892
Did you do that on purpose?

826
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:18,927
No.

827
00:38:18,962 --> 00:38:20,061
Then wha...

828
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:21,163
You know what this is.

829
00:38:21,198 --> 00:38:24,733
This is your body trying
to hold a niffin inside it.

830
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,967
You can't.

831
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:27,569
Not for much longer.

832
00:38:27,604 --> 00:38:29,371
Or it's gonna kill us both.

833
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,947
Well?
Did it work?

834
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:13,114
No. But--

835
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,950
Well, then, get out.

836
00:39:18,155 --> 00:39:19,488
Okay, look.

837
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:20,589
It's gonna be okay.

838
00:39:20,624 --> 00:39:22,791
I'm pregnant.

839
00:39:22,826 --> 00:39:25,527
We're about to go into war.
We need the king.

840
00:39:25,562 --> 00:39:28,129
I need my husband.

841
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:30,232
Well, you got me.

842
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:33,301
I'm gonna take care of you
and the kid.

843
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:36,571
I will untangle
this war shit somehow.

844
00:39:36,607 --> 00:39:39,140
I know the High King
has the power,

845
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:43,044
but I will hunt Ember
to the ends of the world

846
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:46,448
to have that
stupid rule rewritten.

847
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:51,086
Everything El promised,

848
00:39:51,121 --> 00:39:52,988
I'm gonna deliver.

849
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:54,222
You hear me?

850
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:56,057
Yes.

851
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:58,193
Listen to High King Bambi.

852
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:01,229
You're alive.

853
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:06,067
Nice of you to join us, asshole.

854
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:11,406
Really does sound like
you got it all handled.

855
00:40:11,441 --> 00:40:13,008
I do.

856
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:16,244
But it's more fun with you.

857
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:21,182
From "The Book of
Dana Wallens."

858
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:27,188
"His adoptive mother
christened him

859
00:40:27,224 --> 00:40:29,257
John Spencer Gaines."

860
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:30,959
Oh, my God.

861
00:40:30,994 --> 00:40:32,127
You found his name.

862
00:40:32,162 --> 00:40:33,628
Stole, technically.

863
00:40:33,664 --> 00:40:36,965
But I think The Librarian
might let it slide

864
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,367
since now I'm an employee.

865
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:41,303
Wait--you--

866
00:40:41,338 --> 00:40:43,204
you signed that insane contract?

867
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,240
Yeah, it's okay.

868
00:40:44,274 --> 00:40:46,041
How the hell is that okay?

869
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:48,376
Because I get magic back.

870
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:51,880
Least the Order's upfront
about what shit costs.

871
00:40:51,915 --> 00:40:54,215
Plus, the way I see it,
I should already be dead by now.

872
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:56,151
You know?
So this is all bonus.

873
00:40:56,186 --> 00:40:59,387
Who gives a shit
about all that future.

874
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:01,623
Did you do this for me?

875
00:41:01,658 --> 00:41:04,159
Well, not just, but--

876
00:41:04,194 --> 00:41:06,127
yeah.
You know, yeah, I did.

877
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:08,063
Were you not listening
to a word I said?

878
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:09,331
Yeah, I was listening.

879
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:10,599
But guess what,
it's not up to you

880
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:13,234
to decide if
you're worth my time.

881
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:16,137
I get to do whatever the fuck
I want with it,

882
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:17,138
even if it is spend it on a girl

883
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:19,407
that threatens to bail
all the goddamn time.

884
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:21,343
'Cause guess what, Kady?

885
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:24,245
I didn't think I was ever
gonna fucking see you again.

886
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:26,014
And that puts shit
into perspective.

887
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:30,151
I love you.

888
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:32,087
Okay?
Deal.

889
00:41:35,225 --> 00:41:36,491
Shit.

890
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:45,367
Okay, enough.

891
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:47,202
What the fuck?

892
00:41:47,237 --> 00:41:48,937
- Can we do this another time?
- No.

893
00:41:48,972 --> 00:41:50,405
First your mind was weird,

894
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,608
then it got locked up,
and now you're bleeding.

895
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:55,110
Are you high?
Are you possessed?

896
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:57,112
- What's--
- Why do you care?

897
00:41:57,147 --> 00:41:58,713
Because

898
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:00,382
like it or not,

899
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:02,283
we're the closest thing
you have to friends.

900
00:42:05,989 --> 00:42:09,057
Yeah, glass jaw.
Not a surprise.

901
00:42:09,092 --> 00:42:11,693
Don't look at me.
Incept him.

902
00:42:11,728 --> 00:42:15,096
I'll give it to you,
you're practical.

903
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:23,038
Get out of here!
Right now!

904
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:27,142
Alice is in there!

905
00:42:27,177 --> 00:42:28,410
What?
I don't understand.

906
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:29,644
Neither do I, but she's in there

907
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,212
and she just tried to kill me!

908
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:33,214
Okay, well,
what the hell should we do?

909
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:43,408
