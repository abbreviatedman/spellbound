00:00:02,803 --> 00:00:08,071
The High King and I hereby
declare war on the Kingdom of Loria!

3
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:11,667
One cannot simply take
back a declaration of war.

4
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:14,313
My hands can't
cast spells anymore.

5
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:16,541
Help me, I do what I can.

6
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:18,317
I'm a member of The Order,

12
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,161
Well, I guess I
could help for a price.

13
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:34,497
I wanna drive. For an hour a
day, I get control of your body.

14
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:35,828
Fine. It's a deal.

00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:48,211
In the center of your being,
there's a tiny beating heart.

20
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:49,816

26
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:00,890

to find a Mudang.</i>

But you can abort it, right?

30
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:09,069
This is exorcism.

31
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:11,066
That thing is not human.

32
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,063
Did it work? Is it gone?

33
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,309
But, Julia, there
was a complication.

34
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:24,603
QUENTIN: What do you
mean, "lost her Shade"?

35
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,411
When the Mudang cut
the demigod's soul out,

36
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:30,985
they nicked hers by accident.

37
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:35,624
Her Shade, it's gone.

38
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,194
Is she gonna be, like...

39
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:42,164
Honestly,

40
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:44,331

Listen,

00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:03,557
I just want to thank you for

How do you feel?

How do I feel?

54
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:16,660
(EXHALES) I feel light.

Anything that skins foxes?

Yeah, well... (SIGHS)

60
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,106
So, back in the day,

61
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:32,352
Zeus and his, well, frat bros,

62
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:36,254
they ran around kidnapping
and raping with total impunity.

63
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:39,885
So, the Magicians, they'd write these
spells to protect their communities.

64
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:41,354
God-killing spells.

65
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:46,099
The one thing that they all
have in common is they all failed.

66
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:48,958
Maybe it just can't be done.

67
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:51,671
You know what?

68
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,764
We need to write our
own. We can use these.

69
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,184
There's some pretty big
holes, but... (SCOFFS)

70
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,972
I mean, a little ambitious.

71
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,372
We need to be ambitious.

72
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:02,243
Like Martin Chatwin facing
Ember and Umber ambitious.

73
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,782
It can be done.

74

But, you know, say
we get the perfect spell.

75
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:08,913
Think about the energy
it'd take to work it.

76
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:10,820
Right. See, Dana knew that.

77
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,059
She had her power source. We...

78
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,091
I got rid of mine.

79
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:18,794

No hurting anyone.

No casting magic. No sex.

Trust me, you locked
down any possible fun.

Is it me or is morgue
security ridiculously lax?

105
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:48,752
Well, I think stealing
corpses isn't generally a thing.

106
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:50,518
Should be, kind of fun.

107
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:52,452
Anyway, according to the healer,

108
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:54,427
the bridge should take
a few days to enchant.

109
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,520

can travel it

117
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,376
Completely jacks all spellwork.

We're still trying to fix it.

119
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,747
Shall we go see the patient?

120
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:31,058
How's it going?

121
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:35,557
Every time the magic stutters, they
have to start the enchantment over.

122
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,266
Enchant faster.

00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:39,839

I had a pigeon drop a confusion
spell on the Lorian castle,

127
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,951
so they're moving
slow about now.

128
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:53,344
How can I help?

You can go back to

anything can happen at any time.

Oh. Hey, Q. Hey.

147
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:57,050
So, I found a hospital
outside of Hoboken

148
00:06:57,117 --> 00:07:01,213
that took in a surrendered
newborn August 20th, 1976.

149
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:02,581
Holy shit.

150
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,356
Jules, what are
you... I have to go.

151
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,797
No, you need to
stay behind the wards.

152
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,700
Reynard is... Reynard
could give a shit about us.

153
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:21,671
Think. If he was gonna finish
me, he'd have done it by now.

154
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,935
So let's take advantage of that.

155
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:30,945
Uh, Jules, no. Look, she's
right. You're safer here.

156

No offense, Q, I didn't
actually ask your opinion.

157
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:35,979
Thanks, though.

158
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:37,756

00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,038
Hi, Julia.

160
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:00,070
Thought I'd forgotten about you?

161
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,444
You seem like the
type to move on quick

162
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:03,592
when you're
finished with a girl.

163
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:06,245
(LAUGHS) Eh, generally.

164
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,422
Unless they're
carrying my child.

165
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:14,787
I was protecting you.

166
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,798
And what did you go
and do, you little bitch.

167
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,798
Now, Dana wouldn't tell
me what I wanted to know.

168
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:28,006
And it got very,
very painful for her.

169
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:32,039
(CHUCKLES) But you have
more common sense than she does.

170
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,474
Tell me where her son is.

171
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,515
Hmm.

172
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,585
I don't know.

173
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:40,819
Mmm.

175
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:50,822
You're different.

176
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:54,260
Someone's had a little,
uh, Shade amputation.

177
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:55,762
I like it.

178
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:00,806

00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,337
robbing banks thing.

357
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:49,500
That is fun.

358
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:51,735
(SCOFFS) That's funny.

359
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,078
Okay. Here's the deal.

360
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:57,650
I can't exactly study magic
unless I sign an insane contract,

361
00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:59,447
or Mayakovsky
stops dicking around.

362
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,686
What I can do is
help stop the evil freak

363
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:04,595
that tried to rip your
heart out of your chest.

364
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:06,785
I'll sleep better with
him dead. Simple.

365
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:09,491
You wanna keep things
professional? Fine.

366
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,323
It's no big deal.

367
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:16,027
Good.

368
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:33,445
MARGO: Greetings.

369
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:37,485
I am Margo, High
Queen of Fillory.

370
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,457
<i>Habla Inglés</i> or what?

371
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,294
Hi.

372
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:51,696
So, you the nymph?

373
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:53,497
Dryad.

374
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,674
I thought you were all
girls. MARGO: Listen.

375
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,310
I know your tree
buddies don't like us...

376
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:59,777
The rulers of
Fillory have a long

377
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:01,837
and tragic history of
arboreal disrespect.

378
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,348
Yeah, okay.

379
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:04,815
Look, it's a new day.

380
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:06,910
We're a kinder, gentler Fillory.

381
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,887
So we need to settle some
unrest with our Lorian neighbors.

382
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:11,116
Settle unrest?

383
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:13,654
You mean wage war.

384
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:16,490
No, we mean button
some messy shit up.

385
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:17,853
MARGO: Help us here.

386
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:19,455
We wanna make this work.

387
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:21,760
Respectfully. That's rich...

388
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:23,933
Considering your king apparently

389
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:25,801
wouldn't deign to
come here himself,

390
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,498

391
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:30,833
Hey.

392
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,401

393
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,714

394
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,641
And I am Fillory's one
and only High Queen.

395
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,711
Yes, the insult's been noted.

396
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:43,416
Passage is denied.

397
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,990
Good day.

398
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,161
(CHUCKLES) Damn it.

399
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:52,521
Let's go.

400
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,012
Before you ask, no.

401
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,525
No luck with the adoption
records, no luck with the hospital,

402
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:11,847
and no luck with the nurse.

403
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,578
What's wrong with you?

404
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:16,621
Your wards are airtight.

405
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,100
You complained. So I fixed them.

406
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:20,004
Since when are you that
good at fixing anything?

407
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,839
Can we agree that I lose no matter
what I say and just stop talking?

408
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:24,656
So, Reynard's kid...

409
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:28,358
Yeah. So, the trail stops
when the nurse dies.

410
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,969
Shit. If only there was a way

411
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:31,470
to literally see into the past.

412
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:35,571
You know, I think I just
remembered. There might be a way.

413
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:36,870
Yeah, a time bridge?

414
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,934
We thought of that, there's
nothing close enough.

415
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,104
No, uh...

416
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,275
Time sight, literally.

417
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:43,815
We never studied that.

418
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,611
Uh, no, but I think Alice did.

419
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,851
Hmm, uh, can't remember.

420
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,014
Did she or didn't she?

421
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:51,385
She did, uh.

422
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,083
(STAMMERS) I think it was,

423
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:57,691
uh, extra reading
in metageology?

424
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:58,856
Nope. Nope.

425
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:03,561
Um, oh, I think, or, it was an elective
in Basics in Vedic Prognostication.

426
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:05,571
Nope. Nope. Um.

427
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:07,937
Give me an extra hour
tonight and I'll tell you.

428
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:11,842
Hmm. Was it, uh, something
we learned in Sunderland's class.

429
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:13,021
I mean, because we
never studied any...

430
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,045
Are you, like...

431
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:16,675
Having an ADD
moment right now, or...

432
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:18,945
No. Um... (HUMMING)

433
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:20,213
Okay, so here's the thing.

434
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:23,083
Um, there was this one
time, Alice and I, right,

435
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:26,850
we were studying, we
were sharing lab materials.

436
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,592
And people didn't know this about
Alice, but she was really greedy

437
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,359
with her lab materials.

438
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:36,662
Um, and so she would offer to
help me for extra time with them...

439
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,637
None of this is
interesting to any of us.

440
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:42,334
The point is, I would say,
"Twenty extra minutes,

441
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:45,705
"one time offer,
take it or leave it."

442

443
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:48,745
Fine. Deal.

444
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,114
Is how that would
go, in a nutshell.

445
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:54,847

447
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,348
McKellan's got a scope that
can bend light into the past.

449
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:04,924
Ugh. I'm an idiot. Correct.

450
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,896
Shut up, I remembered.

451
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:11,970

it's in Professor McKellan's office.

541
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:33,310

542
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:35,614
He was special, and
he lived in a monastery,

543
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:37,346
a Master Magician.

544
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:39,422

everything about him.

554

So I researched your
weak spots instead.

555

556
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,167

563

564

I mean, there's a ton of
kid bones in this sandbox.

565
00:28:58,704 --> 00:29:01,765

so I had to use

579
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:38,833
Now you can cross into Loria

580

Yeah, I know.

583
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,811
So, the really good news
is you didn't do anything.

584

tree lobby it was all crazy Julia.

585

it wasn't a handful who
escaped. It was just you.

out how to do it.
