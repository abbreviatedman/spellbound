1
00:00:01,229 --> 00:00:02,750
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:02,864 --> 00:00:06,279
The High King and I hereby declare war

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:07,966
on the Kingdom of Loria.

4
00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:11,536
One cannot simply take back
a declaration of war.

5
00:00:11,571 --> 00:00:14,372
My hands can't cast spells anymore.

6
00:00:14,407 --> 00:00:16,741
Help me, I do what I can.

7
00:00:16,776 --> 00:00:18,409
I'm a member of the Order,

8
00:00:18,445 --> 00:00:20,578
the keepers of The Libraries
of the Neitherlands,

9
00:00:20,614 --> 00:00:21,579
the greatest repository of knowledge.

10
00:00:21,615 --> 00:00:23,815
You're a niffin.

11
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,284
Q, I'm not blood-thirsty,
I just want to be free.

12
00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:27,319
Penny!

13
00:00:27,354 --> 00:00:28,720
We're getting you out!

14
00:00:28,755 --> 00:00:30,989
I guess I could help, for a price.

15
00:00:31,024 --> 00:00:32,624
I want to drive.

16
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:34,759
For an hour a day,
I get control of your body.

17
00:00:34,794 --> 00:00:35,927
Fine, it's a deal.

18
00:00:35,962 --> 00:00:37,362
We're gonna make another you.

19
00:00:37,397 --> 00:00:40,431
You sleep here, your mind
goes into the golem.

20
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:44,169
Eliot!

21
00:00:44,204 --> 00:00:45,904
In the center of your being,

22
00:00:45,939 --> 00:00:47,906
there's a tiny beating heart.

23
00:00:47,941 --> 00:00:49,807
It's called "a Shade."

24
00:00:49,843 --> 00:00:51,543
It's what makes you feel.

25
00:00:51,578 --> 00:00:54,245
The pain will burn you
till there's nothing.

26
00:00:54,281 --> 00:00:55,847
It's Reynard, he's back.

27
00:00:55,882 --> 00:00:56,981
He hurt you too, didn't he?

28
00:00:57,017 --> 00:00:58,516
My child is safe.

29
00:00:58,552 --> 00:01:00,685
He'll never know who he really is.

30
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,353
The test was positive.

31
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,490
You will need to find a Mudang.

32
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:07,358
But you can abort it, right?

33
00:01:07,394 --> 00:01:08,927
This is exorcism.

34
00:01:08,962 --> 00:01:11,196
That thing is not human.

35
00:01:11,231 --> 00:01:13,998
Did it work? Is it gone?

36
00:01:14,434 --> 00:01:17,935
But, Julia, there was a complication.

37
00:01:23,042 --> 00:01:24,942
What do you mean, lost her Shade?

38
00:01:24,978 --> 00:01:28,079
When the Mudang
cut the demigod's soul out,

39
00:01:28,114 --> 00:01:32,450
they... they nicked hers by accident.

40
00:01:32,485 --> 00:01:34,952
Her Shade,

41
00:01:34,988 --> 00:01:37,688
it's gone.

42
00:01:37,724 --> 00:01:40,625
Is she gonna be, like...

43
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,027
Honestly, I...

44
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:44,895
I don't know.

45
00:01:51,004 --> 00:01:53,437
Good morning.

46
00:01:53,473 --> 00:01:54,805
Hey, Jesus,

47
00:01:54,841 --> 00:01:56,374
what day is it?

48
00:01:56,409 --> 00:01:57,708
It's Friday.

49
00:01:57,744 --> 00:01:59,210
Are you...

50
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:01,946
Listen, I just want to thank you

51
00:02:01,981 --> 00:02:04,315
for everything you did to help me.

52
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,418
You're looking at me like I'm crazy.

53
00:02:08,988 --> 00:02:10,721
I mean, are you?

54
00:02:10,757 --> 00:02:12,890
How do you feel?

55
00:02:12,925 --> 00:02:14,325
How do I feel?

56
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,061
I feel light.

57
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:20,231
Like a million pound weight's
off my chest.

58
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:23,334
Come.

59
00:02:23,369 --> 00:02:25,169
So what'd you get?

60
00:02:25,204 --> 00:02:26,837
Anything that skins foxes?

61
00:02:26,873 --> 00:02:28,939
Well...

62
00:02:28,975 --> 00:02:30,808
so back in the day,

63
00:02:30,843 --> 00:02:32,843
Zeus and his little frat bros,

64
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,346
they ran around kidnapping and raping

65
00:02:35,381 --> 00:02:37,348
with total impunity, so the Magicians,

66
00:02:37,383 --> 00:02:40,184
they read these spells
to protect their communities,

67
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:42,353
God-killing spells.

68
00:02:42,388 --> 00:02:45,256
The one thing that
they all have in common is

69
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,525
they all failed.

70
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,995
Maybe it just can't be done.

71
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,097
You know what? We need to write our own.

72
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:55,433
We can use these, there's
some pretty big holes, but...

73
00:02:55,468 --> 00:02:57,468
I mean, a little ambitious.

74
00:02:57,503 --> 00:02:59,837
We need to be ambitious,

75
00:02:59,872 --> 00:03:02,773
like Martin Chatwin facing
Ember and Umber ambitious.

76
00:03:02,809 --> 00:03:04,341
It can be done.

77
00:03:04,377 --> 00:03:07,011
But, you know, say
we get the perfect spell,

78
00:03:07,046 --> 00:03:09,313
think about the energy
it'd take to work it.

79
00:03:09,348 --> 00:03:11,215
- Right.
- See, Dana knew that.

80
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,483
She had her power source.

81
00:03:12,518 --> 00:03:16,120
We... I... got rid of mine.

82
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:18,122
Well, what about Ember in Fillory,

83
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:19,123
didn't he help Alice?

84
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:21,025
He's completely AWOL.

85
00:03:22,762 --> 00:03:24,462
Oh, my God.

86
00:03:24,497 --> 00:03:27,398
Dana's baby, Reynard's son.

87
00:03:27,433 --> 00:03:29,366
And there is a ton of lore on demigods.

88
00:03:29,402 --> 00:03:31,035
They're powerful in their own right.

89
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,804
Dana was talking
like he's still out there.

90
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,407
We need to find him.

91
00:03:41,347 --> 00:03:43,481
Hurry up.

92
00:03:43,516 --> 00:03:45,483
I checked your work, it's fine.

93
00:03:45,518 --> 00:03:47,051
Nothing can break a Word As Bond.

94
00:03:47,086 --> 00:03:48,986
I must've overlooked something.

95
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:51,489
No hurting anyone. No casting magic.

96
00:03:51,524 --> 00:03:52,957
No sex.

97
00:03:52,992 --> 00:03:55,926
Trust me, you locked down
any possible fun.

98
00:03:55,962 --> 00:03:58,496
I held up my end of the deal, Q.

99
00:03:58,531 --> 00:03:59,997
Now it's your turn.

100
00:04:00,032 --> 00:04:01,499
Or box me now

101
00:04:01,534 --> 00:04:04,502
'cause I'll drive you insane.

102
00:04:31,397 --> 00:04:33,497
Midnight, my turn. Got it?

103
00:04:33,533 --> 00:04:39,103
Quentin! Where the hell are you?

104
00:04:39,138 --> 00:04:41,539
I'm just glad we managed
to sneak the golem out.

105
00:04:41,574 --> 00:04:45,609
Is it me or is morgue security
ridiculously lax?

106
00:04:45,645 --> 00:04:49,113
Well, I think stealing corpses
isn't generally a thing.

107
00:04:49,148 --> 00:04:50,981
Should be. Kind of fun.

108
00:04:51,017 --> 00:04:52,783
Anyway, according the Healer,

109
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:54,652
the Bridge should take
a few days to enchant.

110
00:04:54,687 --> 00:04:56,887
Then his consciousness can travel it

111
00:04:56,923 --> 00:04:59,256
from the clay back to his body.

112
00:05:00,493 --> 00:05:02,827
And there's that.

113
00:05:02,862 --> 00:05:04,962
Magic brownout. Wellspring.

114
00:05:04,997 --> 00:05:05,796
Not helping.

115
00:05:05,832 --> 00:05:07,298
How often does that happen?

116
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,466
Lately? Sometimes twice a week.

117
00:05:09,502 --> 00:05:11,435
Sometimes twice an hour.

118
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,304
Affects anything that draws current.

119
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:15,806
Completely jacks all spellwork.

120
00:05:15,842 --> 00:05:18,142
We're still trying to fix it.

121
00:05:18,177 --> 00:05:20,477
Shall we go see the patient?

122
00:05:30,022 --> 00:05:32,189
How's it going?

123
00:05:32,225 --> 00:05:34,024
Every time the magic stutters,

124
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,861
they have to start the enchantment over.

125
00:05:36,896 --> 00:05:38,929
Enchant faster.

126
00:05:38,965 --> 00:05:41,498
Yes, Your Majesty.

127
00:05:41,534 --> 00:05:44,134
Is there anything else
that we can be doing?

128
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,036
Hold off the war till he's back.

129
00:05:47,006 --> 00:05:49,006
I had a pigeon drop a confusion spell

130
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:52,343
on the Lorian castle so
they're moving slow about now.

131
00:05:52,378 --> 00:05:53,944
How can I help?

132
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,547
Honestly?

133
00:05:56,582 --> 00:05:59,650
You can go back to Brakebills
and check on Julia.

134
00:05:59,685 --> 00:06:01,652
You know you want to.

135
00:06:01,687 --> 00:06:03,454
If anything changes...

136
00:06:03,489 --> 00:06:06,457
I'll enchant a two-way mirror
to Brakebills,

137
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:08,125
like when Rupert yelled at Jane

138
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,160
through the vanity table in the books.

139
00:06:12,932 --> 00:06:15,232
Hey,

140
00:06:15,268 --> 00:06:17,568
don't worry.

141
00:06:17,603 --> 00:06:21,138
My takeaway lately
is that anything can happen

142
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:23,507
at any time.

143
00:06:23,542 --> 00:06:26,076
So just be there
for your friend while you can.

144
00:06:29,382 --> 00:06:30,681
Here.

145
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:41,191
Hey.

146
00:06:41,227 --> 00:06:42,259
Hey.

147
00:06:42,295 --> 00:06:43,661
How is she?

148
00:06:43,696 --> 00:06:45,562
Oh, well, she's...

149
00:06:45,598 --> 00:06:48,065
Holy shit.

150
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,067
That infomatrixing spell

151
00:06:50,102 --> 00:06:52,236
worked like a motherfucker.

152
00:06:52,271 --> 00:06:54,305
- Oh, hey, Q.
- Hey.

153
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,341
So I found a hospital outside of Hoboken

154
00:06:57,376 --> 00:06:59,109
that took in a surrendered newborn

155
00:06:59,145 --> 00:07:01,679
August 20, 1976.

156
00:07:01,714 --> 00:07:03,547
Holy shit.

157
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:12,923
- Jules, what are you...
- I have to go.

158
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:15,292
No, you need to stay behind the wards.

159
00:07:15,328 --> 00:07:16,560
Reynard is...

160
00:07:16,595 --> 00:07:18,395
Reynard could give a shit about us.

161
00:07:18,431 --> 00:07:19,196
Think.

162
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:21,131
If he was gonna finish me,

163
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:22,199
he'd have done it by now.

164
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:24,601
So let's take advantage of that.

165
00:07:27,807 --> 00:07:30,240
Uh, Jules, no, look, she's right.

166
00:07:30,276 --> 00:07:32,209
You're safer here.

167
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:33,377
No offense, Q,

168
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:35,212
I didn't actually ask your opinion.

169
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:37,147
Thanks, though.

170
00:07:37,183 --> 00:07:38,215
Julia, wait.

171
00:07:52,164 --> 00:07:53,797
Hi, Julia.

172
00:07:58,404 --> 00:08:00,804
You thought I'd forgotten about you?

173
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,819
You seem like the type to move on quick

174
00:08:02,844 --> 00:08:04,241
when you're finished with a girl.

175
00:08:05,177 --> 00:08:07,644
Eh, generally.

176
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,613
Unless they're carrying my child.

177
00:08:13,552 --> 00:08:16,253
I was protecting you.

178
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:19,423
And what did you go and do,
you little bitch?

179
00:08:19,621 --> 00:08:21,792
Now, Dana

180
00:08:21,827 --> 00:08:24,361
wouldn't tell me what I wanted to know.

181
00:08:24,397 --> 00:08:28,399
And it got very, very painful for her.

182
00:08:28,434 --> 00:08:30,501
But you have more

183
00:08:30,536 --> 00:08:32,636
common sense than she does.

184
00:08:32,671 --> 00:08:35,606
Tell me where her son is.

185
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:37,174
Hm.

186
00:08:37,209 --> 00:08:40,110
I don't know.

187
00:08:40,146 --> 00:08:41,311
Mm.

188
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:51,388
You're different.

189
00:08:51,424 --> 00:08:53,190
Someone's had a little, uh,

190
00:08:53,225 --> 00:08:54,625
Shade amputation.

191
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,493
I like it.

192
00:08:59,865 --> 00:09:01,632
I know you're there.

193
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:03,867
Boy.

194
00:09:03,903 --> 00:09:05,335
Quentin.

195
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:08,572
All right, run.

196
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,574
Go on, run.

197
00:09:10,609 --> 00:09:13,310
I'll give you a head start.

198
00:09:19,251 --> 00:09:21,485
I get it. You want to keep me safe.

199
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,553
Thank you.

200
00:09:22,588 --> 00:09:24,655
I'm saying, I just can't

201
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,590
sit on my thumbs in Fillory.

202
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,492
Look, you had the thing
before, the Haxenpaxen,

203
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:30,427
that... that was
making you invisible, right?

204
00:09:30,463 --> 00:09:31,361
So we're in Fillory.

205
00:09:31,397 --> 00:09:33,163
There's a lot of crazy shit here.

206
00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:34,598
So find something else.
Then you can go back.

207
00:09:34,633 --> 00:09:35,866
You don't get it.

208
00:09:35,901 --> 00:09:37,401
There isn't time.

209
00:09:37,436 --> 00:09:39,436
Hm. She's right, Q, there isn't.

210
00:09:39,472 --> 00:09:41,105
It's my turn soon.

211
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,573
Tick tock.

212
00:09:42,608 --> 00:09:44,274
Uh, okay, look,

213
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,610
I am going to go back. I'll help Kady.

214
00:09:46,645 --> 00:09:48,245
We're... we're gonna keep working.

215
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,680
Margo.

216
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:52,349
Uh, Julia needs
to stay here for a while.

217
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:53,851
It's an emergency.

218
00:09:53,886 --> 00:09:55,886
- Fine.
- Thank you.

219
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:00,257
It's a nice place.

220
00:10:04,296 --> 00:10:04,928
Tick tock.

221
00:10:04,964 --> 00:10:06,230
Oh, shit.

222
00:10:12,638 --> 00:10:14,905
Dude, are you okay?

223
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:20,310
I'm fine. Nothing to see here.

224
00:10:21,914 --> 00:10:23,714
Using the gold you procured,

225
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:26,216
we have been able
to amply fund the infantry.

226
00:10:26,252 --> 00:10:27,718
Now, as for Loria...

227
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:30,420
Some 8,000 troops
are headed to the border.

228
00:10:30,456 --> 00:10:31,755
So we're totally outnumbered.

229
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,724
Perhaps not.

230
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:37,227
Our spies have spotted
the Master Magician Illario

231
00:10:37,263 --> 00:10:38,395
at the edge of the woods.

232
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:39,997
That bald illusionist dick

233
00:10:40,032 --> 00:10:41,899
who disappeared the entire castle?

234
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:44,768
We suspect he has enhanced
the number of troops

235
00:10:44,803 --> 00:10:46,069
with trickery.

236
00:10:46,105 --> 00:10:48,605
We believe the actual numbers
are under 3,000.

237
00:10:48,641 --> 00:10:49,740
I like those odds.

238
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:52,442
There is also less good news.

239
00:10:52,478 --> 00:10:54,745
Said troops appear to be amassing

240
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,914
at the edge of the One-Way-Forest.

241
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:58,982
A forest of intelligent trees.

242
00:10:59,018 --> 00:11:00,851
Yeah, I've read about it.

243
00:11:00,886 --> 00:11:02,753
Jane Chatwin tried to pass once and...

244
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:05,022
Uhh, the trees have a

245
00:11:05,057 --> 00:11:06,924
long allegiance with Loria

246
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,627
and, begging pardon,
an excessive dislike of Fillory.

247
00:11:10,663 --> 00:11:12,930
Can you move the trees?

248
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:14,965
They are rooted, Your Highness.

249
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,601
Yeah. I mean with an ax.

250
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:20,337
That would be ill advised.
They are the last of their kind.

251
00:11:22,308 --> 00:11:23,407
Her Languidness suggests

252
00:11:23,442 --> 00:11:25,609
violence against the One-Way-Forest

253
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:27,544
could cause civil war here in Fillory.

254
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,012
Well, in the books, the trees had

255
00:11:29,048 --> 00:11:31,615
some sort of ambassador, a dryad.

256
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,950
You need to negotiate with her.

257
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:35,752
Your Highness, we would not advise...

258
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:39,456
That worked for Jane?

259
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:40,824
- Sold.
- Great.

260
00:11:40,859 --> 00:11:41,792
I'll come with you.

261
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:44,695
Uhh, custom strongly dictates that...

262
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,129
Yeah, I don't care.

263
00:11:46,165 --> 00:11:48,799
Look, I know the books
almost as well as Quentin does.

264
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:50,400
I'm bored.

265
00:11:50,436 --> 00:11:52,236
Let me be a little useful, okay?

266
00:11:52,271 --> 00:11:54,311
Fine. But I do the talking.

267
00:11:54,343 --> 00:11:58,375
You just stand there and look
vaguely indignant or whatever.

268
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,010
Let's go.

269
00:12:12,891 --> 00:12:14,052
It wasn't enough.

270
00:12:14,557 --> 00:12:16,891
I need more time.

271
00:12:16,926 --> 00:12:18,259
To do what?

272
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:20,527
None of your business.

273
00:12:21,197 --> 00:12:23,498
Relax, it's nothing.

274
00:12:30,206 --> 00:12:31,272
What?

275
00:12:31,307 --> 00:12:32,547
I like to read. Is that a crime?

276
00:12:32,575 --> 00:12:34,242
You can't be serious.

277
00:12:34,277 --> 00:12:37,011
I have the right to know
what I've been doing.

278
00:12:37,046 --> 00:12:38,913
Illuminated manuscripts.

279
00:12:38,948 --> 00:12:40,948
I remember this from Art History.

280
00:12:40,984 --> 00:12:43,117
Yeah. A-plus for you.

281
00:12:43,153 --> 00:12:45,186
I was just bored.

282
00:12:45,221 --> 00:12:47,788
The monks got tired
of writing the same thing

283
00:12:47,824 --> 00:12:51,359
over and over again so they...

284
00:12:51,394 --> 00:12:53,528
they embellished in the margins.

285
00:12:53,563 --> 00:12:56,097
Well, a lot of priests dabbled in magic.

286
00:12:56,132 --> 00:12:57,465
Some exploded.

287
00:13:02,138 --> 00:13:03,271
Yeah.

288
00:13:03,306 --> 00:13:05,039
Those monks were drama queens.

289
00:13:05,074 --> 00:13:07,375
Okay. "There must be another way

290
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:11,879
to bring back our brother"?

291
00:13:11,915 --> 00:13:14,882
Are you looking for a way to reverse it?

292
00:13:14,918 --> 00:13:17,852
No. No, Q, I'm not.

293
00:13:17,887 --> 00:13:19,787
Then why are you reading about
all these holy men

294
00:13:19,822 --> 00:13:20,822
trying to fix niffins?

295
00:13:20,857 --> 00:13:22,490
What does it matter, Q?

296
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:23,824
They always fail.

297
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:25,293
Alice.

298
00:13:30,099 --> 00:13:31,332
Oh, my God.

299
00:13:37,173 --> 00:13:38,239
Welcome back, Penny.

300
00:13:38,274 --> 00:13:39,173
I need a book.

301
00:13:39,209 --> 00:13:41,142
"Future Movements in Magic."

302
00:13:41,177 --> 00:13:44,245
All right. Follow me.

303
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,080
Don't they have a copy at Brakebills?

304
00:13:46,115 --> 00:13:47,248
It got destroyed.

305
00:13:47,283 --> 00:13:51,852
I figure you guys
have every book here, so.

306
00:13:51,888 --> 00:13:53,421
Unfortunately, you won't be able

307
00:13:53,456 --> 00:13:54,589
to take this off the premises

308
00:13:54,624 --> 00:13:56,591
since you don't have a library card.

309
00:13:56,626 --> 00:13:59,093
Oh, no-no, I got one, um.

310
00:13:59,128 --> 00:14:00,828
I'm just the errand boy.

311
00:14:00,863 --> 00:14:03,164
Mayakovsky.

312
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,632
I'm surprised the two of you get along.

313
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:07,435
No, we don't. Believe me.

314
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,503
My hands won't cast.

315
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:11,339
He's the only one that can help me,

316
00:14:11,374 --> 00:14:13,541
if I finish fetching
his goddamn grocery list

317
00:14:13,576 --> 00:14:15,343
so we can get started, so.

318
00:14:15,378 --> 00:14:16,611
Ah.

319
00:14:16,646 --> 00:14:17,945
I can put a rush on this book.

320
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:19,380
Thank you.

321
00:14:19,415 --> 00:14:21,382
If you're sure
that's what you really want.

322
00:14:21,417 --> 00:14:23,117
Well, I really want magic, so, yeah.

323
00:14:23,152 --> 00:14:25,453
But to pay for it with
servitude to a lying drunkard...

324
00:14:25,488 --> 00:14:27,355
What's the alternative?

325
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:28,889
Us.

326
00:14:28,925 --> 00:14:30,658
You?

327
00:14:30,693 --> 00:14:32,627
Librarians?

328
00:14:32,662 --> 00:14:34,295
The Order of the Library
of the Neitherlands

329
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,197
are Master Magicians.

330
00:14:36,232 --> 00:14:38,132
We can help you, Penny.

331
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:40,468
'Kay.

332
00:14:40,503 --> 00:14:42,970
What's the catch?

333
00:14:43,006 --> 00:14:45,072
This contract initiates our services

334
00:14:45,108 --> 00:14:45,973
in exchange for...

335
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:49,043
Unlimited manual and magical labor?

336
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:50,578
Bound in service to the library

337
00:14:50,613 --> 00:14:52,580
up to and after my death,
are you kidding?

338
00:14:52,615 --> 00:14:54,115
All very standard.

339
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,150
For a period of no less
than one million years?

340
00:14:56,185 --> 00:14:58,019
Okay, lady, are you joking?

341
00:14:58,054 --> 00:14:59,520
No.

342
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,123
Okay.

343
00:15:04,193 --> 00:15:05,926
Okay, here's what Julia found.

344
00:15:05,962 --> 00:15:08,062
August 20, 1976.

345
00:15:08,097 --> 00:15:11,132
Baby surrendered at hospital.

346
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:13,234
Uh, a nurse, Michelle Walker

347
00:15:13,269 --> 00:15:16,671
transferred it to
a state social worker, uh.

348
00:15:16,706 --> 00:15:19,073
And after that

349
00:15:19,108 --> 00:15:21,075
nothing, there's
no record of adoption or...

350
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:22,443
Okay, so,

351
00:15:22,478 --> 00:15:24,211
where's Michelle Walker now?

352
00:15:27,417 --> 00:15:29,283
Merciful Sisters Cemetery.

353
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:31,352
Oh, shit.

354
00:15:31,387 --> 00:15:33,020
Sh.

355
00:15:35,558 --> 00:15:37,024
Shit what?

356
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,760
Just... dead ended again.

357
00:15:39,796 --> 00:15:41,262
How's Mayakovsky?

358
00:15:41,297 --> 00:15:43,064
Oh, still a jerk-off, you know.

359
00:15:46,135 --> 00:15:47,735
What's wrong with you?

360
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,136
Hm?

361
00:15:49,172 --> 00:15:51,472
Your mind is

362
00:15:51,507 --> 00:15:55,209
- doing something.
- Uh, no, it's not.

363
00:15:55,244 --> 00:15:57,545
He's talking about me, Q.

364
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,979
- Stop that.
- Stop what?

365
00:15:59,015 --> 00:16:01,649
Stop singing Imagine Dragons
to get me off the track.

366
00:16:01,684 --> 00:16:03,584
Lock it up, Q. Seriously.

367
00:16:03,619 --> 00:16:05,386
Look, why are you always
poking around in me anyway?

368
00:16:05,421 --> 00:16:06,487
Can you just leave me alone?

369
00:16:06,522 --> 00:16:07,522
Oh, I'd love to.

370
00:16:07,557 --> 00:16:08,656
You leak, asshole.

371
00:16:08,691 --> 00:16:11,625
Okay. I have got to, uh...

372
00:16:15,531 --> 00:16:16,764
The hell was that?

373
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:20,067
Something's wronger than usual.

374
00:16:20,103 --> 00:16:22,470
And he's a grown man.

375
00:16:22,505 --> 00:16:24,238
Moving on.

376
00:16:24,273 --> 00:16:25,740
Have you eaten lately?

377
00:16:25,775 --> 00:16:27,608
You should eat.

378
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:33,180
Penny, we still haven't...

379
00:16:33,216 --> 00:16:34,582
you know,

380
00:16:34,617 --> 00:16:36,584
talked.

381
00:16:38,187 --> 00:16:40,254
Uh, I thought we weren't gonna.

382
00:16:40,289 --> 00:16:43,190
Yeah, well, that was
when this was some quick fun,

383
00:16:43,226 --> 00:16:45,593
not hanging out 24/7

384
00:16:45,628 --> 00:16:48,195
fucking our brains out, robbing banks.

385
00:16:48,231 --> 00:16:50,264
That is fun.

386
00:16:50,299 --> 00:16:51,365
It's all I need.

387
00:16:52,535 --> 00:16:53,701
Okay, here's the deal.

388
00:16:53,736 --> 00:16:55,669
I can't exactly study magic

389
00:16:55,705 --> 00:16:57,371
unless I sign an insane contract

390
00:16:57,407 --> 00:17:00,040
or Mayakovsky stops dicking around.

391
00:17:00,076 --> 00:17:02,376
What I can do
is help stop the evil freak

392
00:17:02,412 --> 00:17:04,445
that tried to rip your heart
out of your chest.

393
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,158
I'll sleep better with him dead. Simple.

394
00:17:07,404 --> 00:17:09,950
You want to keep things
professional? Fine.

395
00:17:09,986 --> 00:17:11,285
It's no big deal.

396
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:15,856
Good.

397
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,699
Greetings!

398
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:38,245
I am Margo, High Queen of Fillory.

399
00:17:40,282 --> 00:17:43,016
Habla Ingles or what?

400
00:17:49,158 --> 00:17:50,490
Hi.

401
00:17:50,526 --> 00:17:52,259
So you the nymph?

402
00:17:52,294 --> 00:17:53,894
Dryad.

403
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:55,328
I thought you were all girls.

404
00:17:55,364 --> 00:17:58,598
Listen, I know your
tree buddies don't like us.

405
00:17:58,634 --> 00:18:00,567
The rulers of Fillory
have a long and tragic

406
00:18:00,602 --> 00:18:02,069
history of arboreal disrespect.

407
00:18:02,104 --> 00:18:03,637
Yeah, okay.

408
00:18:03,672 --> 00:18:04,905
Look, it's a new day.

409
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,140
We're a kinder, gentler Fillory.

410
00:18:07,176 --> 00:18:10,143
So we need to settle some unrest
with our Lorian neighbors.

411
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:12,345
Settle unrest.

412
00:18:12,381 --> 00:18:13,680
You mean wage war.

413
00:18:13,716 --> 00:18:15,182
No, we mean

414
00:18:15,217 --> 00:18:16,750
button some messy shit up.

415
00:18:16,785 --> 00:18:18,485
Help us here.

416
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,020
We want to make this work.

417
00:18:20,055 --> 00:18:21,021
Respectfully.

418
00:18:21,056 --> 00:18:22,422
That's rich.

419
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:24,624
Considering your king
apparently wouldn't deign

420
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,593
to come here himself,

421
00:18:26,628 --> 00:18:29,696
sending two females.

422
00:18:29,732 --> 00:18:34,000
Hey, this is Julia.

423
00:18:34,036 --> 00:18:37,003
Royal Ambassador.

424
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,873
And I am Fillory's
one and only High Queen.

425
00:18:39,908 --> 00:18:41,942
Yes. The insult's been noted.

426
00:18:41,977 --> 00:18:43,710
Passage is denied.

427
00:18:43,746 --> 00:18:44,878
Good day.

428
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:51,218
Damn it.

429
00:18:51,253 --> 00:18:52,319
Let's go.

430
00:19:06,668 --> 00:19:07,734
Before you ask, no.

431
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:09,803
No luck with the adoption records.

432
00:19:09,838 --> 00:19:13,473
No luck with the hospital.
And no luck with the nurse.

433
00:19:13,509 --> 00:19:14,741
What's wrong with you?

434
00:19:14,777 --> 00:19:16,643
Your wards are airtight.

435
00:19:16,678 --> 00:19:17,711
You complained, so I fixed them.

436
00:19:17,746 --> 00:19:20,147
Since when are you
that good at fixing anything?

437
00:19:20,182 --> 00:19:21,982
Can we agree that I lose
no matter what I say,

438
00:19:22,017 --> 00:19:23,049
and just stop talking?

439
00:19:23,085 --> 00:19:25,652
So Reynard's kid.

440
00:19:25,687 --> 00:19:26,920
Yeah, so,

441
00:19:26,955 --> 00:19:28,255
the trail stops when the nurse dies.

442
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,689
Shit.

443
00:19:29,725 --> 00:19:32,826
If only there was a way
to literally see into the past.

444
00:19:32,861 --> 00:19:34,361
You know, I think I just remembered

445
00:19:34,396 --> 00:19:35,595
there might be a way.

446
00:19:35,631 --> 00:19:37,864
Yeah, time bridge. We thought of that.

447
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,099
There's nothing close enough.

448
00:19:39,134 --> 00:19:40,367
No, uh,

449
00:19:40,402 --> 00:19:42,569
time sight, literally.

450
00:19:42,604 --> 00:19:44,004
We never studied that.

451
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:46,907
Uh, no, but I think Alice did.

452
00:19:46,942 --> 00:19:48,909
Hmm, uh, can't remember.

453
00:19:48,944 --> 00:19:50,243
Did she or didn't she?

454
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:51,578
She did, uh.

455
00:19:51,613 --> 00:19:53,113
I think it was

456
00:19:53,148 --> 00:19:55,916
uh, uh, extra reading

457
00:19:55,951 --> 00:19:57,851
in Metageology?

458
00:19:57,886 --> 00:19:58,819
- Nope.
- Nope.

459
00:19:58,854 --> 00:20:01,521
Um, oh, I think, or, it was an elective

460
00:20:01,557 --> 00:20:03,790
in, uh, Basics in Vedic Prognostication.

461
00:20:03,826 --> 00:20:05,926
- Nope.
- Nope. Um.

462
00:20:05,961 --> 00:20:07,961
Give me an extra hour tonight
and I'll tell you.

463
00:20:07,996 --> 00:20:08,962
Hm.

464
00:20:08,997 --> 00:20:10,363
Was it, uh, something we learned

465
00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:12,732
in Sunderland's class, I mean,
'cause we never studied...

466
00:20:12,768 --> 00:20:14,701
Are you, like,

467
00:20:14,736 --> 00:20:17,070
having an ADD moment right now, or?

468
00:20:17,105 --> 00:20:19,105
No... it... um...

469
00:20:19,141 --> 00:20:20,040
Okay, so here's the thing.

470
00:20:20,075 --> 00:20:21,908
Um, there's this one time,

471
00:20:21,944 --> 00:20:23,243
Alice and I, right?

472
00:20:23,278 --> 00:20:24,644
We were studying;

473
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,147
we were sharing lab materials.

474
00:20:27,182 --> 00:20:28,281
And people didn't know this about Alice,

475
00:20:28,317 --> 00:20:30,617
but she was really greedy

476
00:20:30,652 --> 00:20:32,552
with her lab materials.

477
00:20:32,588 --> 00:20:34,120
Um, and

478
00:20:34,156 --> 00:20:36,890
so she would offer to help me
for extra time with them...

479
00:20:36,925 --> 00:20:38,925
None of this
is interesting to any of us.

480
00:20:38,961 --> 00:20:39,961
The point is

481
00:20:39,995 --> 00:20:43,230
I would say 20 extra minutes,

482
00:20:43,265 --> 00:20:45,065
one time offer,

483
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,166
take it or leave it.

484
00:20:46,201 --> 00:20:47,300
30.

485
00:20:47,336 --> 00:20:50,270
Fine. Deal.

486
00:20:50,305 --> 00:20:51,738
Is how that would go.

487
00:20:51,773 --> 00:20:53,740
In a nutshell.

488
00:20:53,775 --> 00:20:54,808
Phosphoromancy.

489
00:20:54,843 --> 00:20:56,977
My discipline, idiot.

490
00:20:57,012 --> 00:20:59,746
McKellan's got a scope that
can bend light into the past.

491
00:20:59,781 --> 00:21:02,749
Phosphoromancy.

492
00:21:02,784 --> 00:21:04,317
Ugh. I'm an idiot.

493
00:21:04,353 --> 00:21:05,353
Correct.

494
00:21:05,387 --> 00:21:07,654
Shut up, I... remembered.

495
00:21:07,689 --> 00:21:09,356
Uh, okay, so

496
00:21:09,391 --> 00:21:12,192
the viewing device, it's
in Professor McKellan's office.

497
00:21:12,227 --> 00:21:14,160
Ooh, Penny.

498
00:21:14,196 --> 00:21:16,796
See, even he can't wait
to get away from you.

499
00:21:19,401 --> 00:21:21,768
Is this thing gonna work or not?

500
00:21:21,803 --> 00:21:23,970
Eliot has shit to do.

501
00:21:24,006 --> 00:21:26,673
He has to do the work of crossing back.

502
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,875
Not everyone chooses to do so.

503
00:21:28,911 --> 00:21:32,178
Okay. Can you step out for a minute?

504
00:21:32,214 --> 00:21:34,247
Fen, you too, sweetie.

505
00:21:41,823 --> 00:21:44,624
Eliot,

506
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:48,295
you need to come back.

507
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:51,698
I know that you have
a constant low-key death wish,

508
00:21:51,733 --> 00:21:55,302
but you can't leave.

509
00:21:55,337 --> 00:21:57,237
They don't want me.

510
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,373
They want the High King.

511
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:13,987
I'm faking it, El.

512
00:22:16,925 --> 00:22:20,327
So if you could just

513
00:22:20,362 --> 00:22:22,963
please,

514
00:22:22,998 --> 00:22:26,132
please, wake up.

515
00:22:38,113 --> 00:22:41,081
I set it to August 20, 1976.

516
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,087
Holy shit.

517
00:22:49,424 --> 00:22:50,557
What, what do you see?

518
00:22:50,592 --> 00:22:52,058
Uh, just

519
00:22:52,094 --> 00:22:53,560
people waiting.

520
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,703
Oh, here we go.

521
00:23:03,739 --> 00:23:05,205
What?

522
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,308
A nurse with a baby.

523
00:23:17,486 --> 00:23:19,285
Uh.

524
00:23:19,321 --> 00:23:22,155
What?

525
00:23:24,626 --> 00:23:26,126
You got to be kidding me.

526
00:23:26,161 --> 00:23:27,827
What?

527
00:23:27,863 --> 00:23:28,895
What's wrong?

528
00:23:33,168 --> 00:23:36,169
Ah, shit.

529
00:23:36,204 --> 00:23:37,437
Dana did this.

530
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,339
To protect the baby's identity,

531
00:23:39,374 --> 00:23:42,342
even from spells 40 years in the future.

532
00:23:42,377 --> 00:23:44,891
She thought of everything.

533
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:48,365
And back to square nothing.

534
00:24:16,248 --> 00:24:17,147
Hi.

535
00:24:17,183 --> 00:24:18,882
I'm Julia.

536
00:24:18,918 --> 00:24:20,384
God, been waiting hours

537
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:22,286
for you to get close enough to grab.

538
00:24:22,321 --> 00:24:23,987
I think my foot fell asleep.

539
00:24:24,023 --> 00:24:25,823
I will never help Fillory.

540
00:24:25,858 --> 00:24:26,957
I'd sooner be skinned.

541
00:24:26,992 --> 00:24:28,892
All right, boys, let him go.

542
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:31,161
Give us some air, but stay close-ish.

543
00:24:33,632 --> 00:24:35,232
Hate Fillory all you want.

544
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:36,567
I'm here for one thing,

545
00:24:36,602 --> 00:24:38,268
and then I'm off this planet.

546
00:24:38,304 --> 00:24:40,137
An invisibility spell

547
00:24:40,172 --> 00:24:43,240
strong enough to hide from a god.

548
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:44,308
And why should I give it to you?

549
00:24:44,343 --> 00:24:47,010
Because I may not
give a shit about Fillory.

550
00:24:47,046 --> 00:24:49,346
But I do, as its Royal Ambassador,

551
00:24:49,381 --> 00:24:52,449
have access to
its guards and its dungeons.

552
00:24:52,484 --> 00:24:55,419
And I'll use A to throw you in B,

553
00:24:55,454 --> 00:24:57,921
but help me, and I'll let you go free.

554
00:24:57,957 --> 00:24:59,089
I don't believe you.

555
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:00,157
Your loyalty will always lie with...

556
00:25:00,192 --> 00:25:01,625
With me.

557
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,927
My loyalty will always lie with me.

558
00:25:30,656 --> 00:25:33,190
Drill a hole in it. Wear it.

559
00:25:33,225 --> 00:25:34,391
No god can sense you.

560
00:25:34,426 --> 00:25:37,160
Thank you.

561
00:25:37,196 --> 00:25:39,196
You're free to go.

562
00:25:48,173 --> 00:25:50,007
Hey, dryad boy!

563
00:25:51,076 --> 00:25:54,344
Come on out.
I saw you in there, sweetheart.

564
00:25:58,183 --> 00:26:00,584
Negotiations are over.

565
00:26:00,619 --> 00:26:02,319
Go home.

566
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:05,022
I brought you something.

567
00:26:07,793 --> 00:26:09,493
A small token of peace.

568
00:26:09,528 --> 00:26:10,761
It won't change anything.

569
00:26:10,796 --> 00:26:13,096
Just give it to your bosses.

570
00:26:13,132 --> 00:26:15,365
I'm trying to fix this.

571
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,476
Thank you.

572
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,453
I've been looking for you.

573
00:27:13,525 --> 00:27:15,993
You've lived here since
the Bush administration,

574
00:27:16,028 --> 00:27:17,761
but you're thousands of years old.

575
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,134
You're an AnglerBeast.

576
00:27:24,169 --> 00:27:25,669
That's stupid.

577
00:27:25,704 --> 00:27:27,771
You play too much Dungeons and Dragons.

578
00:27:30,376 --> 00:27:33,577
You knew a man, a long time ago.

579
00:27:33,612 --> 00:27:35,779
He was special and
he lived in a monastery,

580
00:27:35,814 --> 00:27:37,814
a Master Magician.

581
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:40,350
Friar Joseph.

582
00:27:40,386 --> 00:27:41,685
Ring a bell?

583
00:27:45,824 --> 00:27:48,025
I want to know everything about him.

584
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:51,528
Well, in the parlance of your time,

585
00:27:51,563 --> 00:27:54,765
fuck you, pay me.

586
00:27:56,535 --> 00:27:58,602
Fresh meat.

587
00:27:58,637 --> 00:28:01,772
Newborns are the sweetest.

588
00:28:03,675 --> 00:28:06,543
You know, I thought about doing that,

589
00:28:06,578 --> 00:28:08,779
but my time is very limited.

590
00:28:08,814 --> 00:28:12,783
So I researched your weak spots instead.

591
00:28:12,818 --> 00:28:14,818
And you believe what you read?

592
00:28:24,596 --> 00:28:27,497
That was stupid of you.

593
00:28:39,845 --> 00:28:41,878
Oh, my God.

594
00:28:44,883 --> 00:28:46,316
Alice, what did you do?

595
00:28:46,351 --> 00:28:47,818
Relax.

596
00:28:47,853 --> 00:28:51,221
Can't hurt anybody, remember?

597
00:28:51,256 --> 00:28:52,256
But she's...

598
00:28:52,291 --> 00:28:54,257
A monster.

599
00:28:54,293 --> 00:28:55,425
Technically, I did good here.

600
00:28:55,461 --> 00:28:58,662
I mean, there's a ton of
kid bones in this sandbox.

601
00:28:58,697 --> 00:29:02,833
It wasn't cooperating so I had to use

602
00:29:02,868 --> 00:29:05,502
enhanced interrogation techniques.

603
00:29:05,537 --> 00:29:07,504
To find out what?

604
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:10,540
We might want to go before
the rest of it lumbers up here.

605
00:29:10,576 --> 00:29:12,542
It's pretty mad at me.

606
00:29:16,815 --> 00:29:18,949
What the hell were you thinking, huh?

607
00:29:18,984 --> 00:29:20,684
You burned down the One-Way-Forest

608
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:24,187
while I'm trying to
wiggle us out of full-on war?

609
00:29:24,223 --> 00:29:26,356
Those trees were dicks.

610
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:28,125
They were endangered.

611
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,460
Now trees all over Fillory are enraged

612
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,328
and calling for action.

613
00:29:31,363 --> 00:29:34,364
Do you have any idea
what you did, Julia?

614
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:35,765
Yeah.

615
00:29:35,801 --> 00:29:37,434
I helped you.

616
00:29:37,469 --> 00:29:38,902
Now you can cross into Loria

617
00:29:38,937 --> 00:29:40,937
and kick their fucking asses
like you wanted to.

618
00:29:40,973 --> 00:29:43,740
This is not how
I wanted to go about that.

619
00:29:43,775 --> 00:29:45,642
Yeah, I know.

620
00:29:45,677 --> 00:29:47,377
So the really good news is

621
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:49,379
you didn't do anything.

622
00:29:49,414 --> 00:29:51,214
Go back and tell the angry tree lobby

623
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,483
it was all crazy Julia.

624
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:54,384
You're welcome.

625
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,319
Look, I got what I wanted.

626
00:29:56,355 --> 00:29:57,787
The rest was all a favor to you.

627
00:29:57,823 --> 00:29:59,656
So banish me forever.

628
00:29:59,691 --> 00:30:01,892
Send me home.

629
00:30:01,927 --> 00:30:04,427
You know, in a sick way,

630
00:30:04,463 --> 00:30:06,396
I sort of admire you.

631
00:30:06,431 --> 00:30:08,598
That being said, here's what we do

632
00:30:08,634 --> 00:30:11,234
to loose cannons in Fillory, ready?

633
00:30:12,437 --> 00:30:14,271
Guards!

634
00:30:14,306 --> 00:30:17,174
Take this bitch to the dungeon.

635
00:30:17,209 --> 00:30:18,408
You gotta be kidding me.

636
00:30:18,443 --> 00:30:20,744
Now, if you'll excuse me,

637
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:22,612
I have some damage control to do.

638
00:30:27,352 --> 00:30:29,586
How to break a Word As Bond.

639
00:30:32,291 --> 00:30:35,425
Reversing a Word As Bond.

640
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,360
Amending a Word As Bond.

641
00:30:37,396 --> 00:30:39,296
It's not there.

642
00:30:39,331 --> 00:30:42,332
That's the whole point.
You can't break it.

643
00:30:42,367 --> 00:30:44,000
Why don't you do something useful

644
00:30:44,036 --> 00:30:48,038
and catch up on all the classes
you missed in Fillory?

645
00:30:48,073 --> 00:30:49,439
This isn't working.

646
00:30:49,474 --> 00:30:50,474
Yeah, tell me about it.

647
00:30:50,509 --> 00:30:52,442
Keeping you a secret
and trying to help you

648
00:30:52,477 --> 00:30:55,445
while you do God knows what.

649
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,781
I have to ask for help.
I need to tell someone.

650
00:30:57,816 --> 00:30:58,982
Great idea.

651
00:30:59,017 --> 00:31:01,384
You think you know locked up for crazy?

652
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,953
They'll put you someplace
you can't even imagine.

653
00:31:02,988 --> 00:31:04,788
And they'll box me up so quick...

654
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:06,122
all your efforts for nothing.
Is that what you want?

655
00:31:06,158 --> 00:31:08,525
I want Alice back. I want the real you.

656
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,027
I want... I...

657
00:31:11,063 --> 00:31:12,963
I can't help Fillory.

658
00:31:12,998 --> 00:31:14,297
And I can't help Eliot.

659
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:15,732
And I can't help Julia.

660
00:31:15,767 --> 00:31:18,201
And I just want to do...

661
00:31:18,237 --> 00:31:20,337
God, one thing for the person
that deserves it the most.

662
00:31:20,372 --> 00:31:23,673
That's what I want.

663
00:31:23,709 --> 00:31:24,874
God.

664
00:31:27,913 --> 00:31:29,646
I understand.

665
00:31:32,084 --> 00:31:35,318
Do you want to know the truth?

666
00:31:35,354 --> 00:31:37,220
You are a failure.

667
00:31:37,256 --> 00:31:40,657
So stop using me to try to fix that.

668
00:31:40,692 --> 00:31:42,492
Uh-oh, look at the time.

669
00:31:42,526 --> 00:31:45,560
- Uh... wait... no.
- Word As Bond, kid. My turn.

670
00:31:54,694 --> 00:31:56,694
What are we drinking to?

671
00:31:57,725 --> 00:31:59,897
Dead ends.

672
00:32:04,376 --> 00:32:05,475
What?

673
00:32:05,511 --> 00:32:07,010
I'm adjusting.

674
00:32:07,045 --> 00:32:08,445
You used to hold your liquor better.

675
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,547
Yeah, well, I used to drink for fun.

676
00:32:12,584 --> 00:32:14,451
Now I drink to get too fucked up

677
00:32:14,486 --> 00:32:17,424
to go out and do anything worse.

678
00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:20,857
God, I hope this works as a mixer.

679
00:32:24,563 --> 00:32:26,229
Oh...

680
00:32:26,265 --> 00:32:29,299
did I forget to mention
that I have to take this now?

681
00:32:29,334 --> 00:32:30,901
'Cause I'm a junkie.

682
00:32:30,936 --> 00:32:32,536
Ah.

683
00:32:32,571 --> 00:32:34,805
Just trying to stay straight long enough

684
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:38,308
to find Reynard without
falling the fuck apart.

685
00:32:38,343 --> 00:32:39,576
Kady, we're...

686
00:32:39,611 --> 00:32:42,679
we're gonna find the son.

687
00:32:42,714 --> 00:32:44,581
You think?

688
00:32:44,616 --> 00:32:46,416
I think

689
00:32:46,451 --> 00:32:47,551
you and me,

690
00:32:47,586 --> 00:32:50,053
put our minds together?

691
00:32:50,088 --> 00:32:51,321
Shit gets done.

692
00:32:51,356 --> 00:32:53,490
Oh, God.

693
00:32:53,525 --> 00:32:56,593
That is so stupid it's sad.

694
00:32:56,628 --> 00:32:58,662
And I don't think you were listening

695
00:32:58,697 --> 00:33:00,463
when I said I'm not
your fucking girlfriend...

696
00:33:00,499 --> 00:33:02,232
Good. I don't want one.

697
00:33:02,267 --> 00:33:03,934
Oh, yeah.

698
00:33:03,969 --> 00:33:05,068
Yeah, I get it.

699
00:33:05,103 --> 00:33:08,405
Yeah, you're very tough, right?

700
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,241
Oh, God... yeah, you're real cool.

701
00:33:11,276 --> 00:33:14,177
You're not hearing me.

702
00:33:14,213 --> 00:33:16,346
I am not your problem.

703
00:33:16,381 --> 00:33:18,381
This isn't your chance to prove

704
00:33:18,417 --> 00:33:21,585
that you're some kind of hero.

705
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:26,089
You want your dick sucked?
Great, I can do that.

706
00:33:26,124 --> 00:33:30,293
Then I'd love it if you'd fuck off.

707
00:33:57,589 --> 00:33:59,956
BBC World News...

708
00:33:59,992 --> 00:34:01,658
I had him stop for fish and chips.

709
00:34:01,693 --> 00:34:03,493
Best shop in Dublin, he said.

710
00:34:03,528 --> 00:34:04,761
Are you kidding me?

711
00:34:06,698 --> 00:34:08,632
Wait, uh, no, no, just, uh,

712
00:34:08,667 --> 00:34:12,002
just wait here for a second.

713
00:34:12,037 --> 00:34:14,170
You portaled us to Ireland?

714
00:34:15,173 --> 00:34:16,239
To do what?

715
00:34:16,275 --> 00:34:17,574
- Where are we going?
- Home.

716
00:34:17,609 --> 00:34:19,142
It's done. We already did it.

717
00:34:19,177 --> 00:34:22,178
Did what?

718
00:34:22,214 --> 00:34:25,749
Alice, what did you do?

719
00:34:25,784 --> 00:34:26,784
Uh,

720
00:34:26,818 --> 00:34:29,686
oh, uh, sir,
where did we just come from?

721
00:34:29,721 --> 00:34:31,321
About three streets that way.

722
00:34:31,356 --> 00:34:33,657
Great. Can we go back there now?

723
00:34:33,692 --> 00:34:35,492
Right.

724
00:34:35,527 --> 00:34:38,695
Wait, Quentin, no. I'm serious, don't.

725
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:40,630
Q, stop. Hold on.

726
00:34:40,666 --> 00:34:43,700
Q, please, wait.

727
00:34:43,735 --> 00:34:45,635
Please, Quentin, don't.

728
00:35:00,852 --> 00:35:02,285
You...

729
00:35:02,321 --> 00:35:04,554
Tricked you with reverse psychology?

730
00:35:04,589 --> 00:35:06,189
It was shockingly easy.

731
00:35:06,224 --> 00:35:07,824
"No, don't go. Please."

732
00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:09,993
- Alice, what did you do?
- Nothing.

733
00:35:10,028 --> 00:35:12,729
I can't do magic, remember?
I'm stuck inside you.

734
00:35:12,764 --> 00:35:14,564
So you did it.

735
00:35:16,234 --> 00:35:18,201
I believe you called to me

736
00:35:18,236 --> 00:35:20,303
with something personal,

737
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:24,641
at the place of my transformation.

738
00:35:25,677 --> 00:35:27,243
The music you got wrong.

739
00:35:27,279 --> 00:35:28,845
Ponderous.

740
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,814
Ah, but the birds.

741
00:35:30,849 --> 00:35:32,482
I did love those.

742
00:35:32,517 --> 00:35:33,483
All my life,

743
00:35:33,518 --> 00:35:37,687
I thought them God's most perfect

744
00:35:37,723 --> 00:35:39,089
works of art.

745
00:35:39,124 --> 00:35:40,490
Just look at them.

746
00:35:43,862 --> 00:35:45,228
Bit annoying, though.

747
00:35:45,263 --> 00:35:47,397
All that cooing.

748
00:35:47,432 --> 00:35:49,232
Now,

749
00:35:49,267 --> 00:35:51,835
why did you summon me?

750
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,737
Or didn't you mean to do that?

751
00:35:53,772 --> 00:35:55,338
Maybe it was you.

752
00:35:56,708 --> 00:35:57,774
You can see me.

753
00:35:57,809 --> 00:35:59,009
Of course I can.

754
00:35:59,044 --> 00:36:02,345
What on earth are you doing
inside this boy?

755
00:36:02,381 --> 00:36:04,681
Friar Joseph, I...
I've been searching for you.

756
00:36:04,716 --> 00:36:07,417
I need your help. With him.

757
00:36:07,452 --> 00:36:11,621
This crushable little field mouse?

758
00:36:11,656 --> 00:36:14,190
Seni baglamak. I bind you.

759
00:36:14,226 --> 00:36:16,292
Seni baglamak. I bind you!

760
00:36:18,397 --> 00:36:19,863
Silly boy.

761
00:36:19,898 --> 00:36:22,932
I can't be boxed.

762
00:36:26,078 --> 00:36:28,355
I read about you.

763
00:36:28,475 --> 00:36:30,677
Priests studying magic
till they've gone too far

764
00:36:30,713 --> 00:36:32,646
that their brothers have to box them.

765
00:36:32,994 --> 00:36:34,994
Except sometimes
the boxing doesn't go right.

766
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:38,665
Yes, the occasional
niffin did slip through.

767
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,933
That's what I thought.

768
00:36:39,968 --> 00:36:42,101
Until I figured out that

769
00:36:42,137 --> 00:36:44,771
it wasn't a handful
who escaped, it was just you.

770
00:36:44,806 --> 00:36:47,507
You slipped away over and over again

771
00:36:47,542 --> 00:36:49,943
because you figured out how to do it.

772
00:36:49,978 --> 00:36:52,478
You can't be boxed.

773
00:36:52,514 --> 00:36:54,180
I need you to teach me.

774
00:36:54,216 --> 00:36:55,782
- Al...
- Will you make him shut up?

775
00:36:55,817 --> 00:36:57,917
- I can do anything in here.
- No, I won't...

776
00:37:02,357 --> 00:37:03,556
I'll do anything.

777
00:37:03,592 --> 00:37:05,091
I'm serious.

778
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,066
Shit.

779
00:37:13,101 --> 00:37:14,367
Let him go, if he passes out

780
00:37:14,402 --> 00:37:16,236
I won't be able to talk to you anymore.

781
00:37:20,742 --> 00:37:22,375
Please show me how you do it.

782
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:25,612
I've been like this for six centuries.

783
00:37:25,647 --> 00:37:27,380
The things that I know now

784
00:37:27,415 --> 00:37:29,015
you cannot imagine.

785
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,416
That's what I want.

786
00:37:31,786 --> 00:37:33,219
Please, can I go with you?

787
00:37:33,255 --> 00:37:35,288
You? With me?

788
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:41,394
You can't even get out of
this shoddy little Magician.

789
00:37:41,429 --> 00:37:44,631
How smart, how able could you be?

790
00:37:44,666 --> 00:37:49,068
How could you help me
with anything worthwhile?

791
00:37:49,104 --> 00:37:50,903
Listen to me, it's not that simple.

792
00:37:50,939 --> 00:37:52,905
But it is.

793
00:37:52,941 --> 00:37:54,741
Free yourself.

794
00:37:54,776 --> 00:37:56,442
But I can't. The... the trap is...

795
00:37:56,478 --> 00:37:58,411
Find a way.

796
00:37:58,446 --> 00:38:00,146
Then find me.

797
00:38:00,181 --> 00:38:02,915
Then I will show you a secret or two.

798
00:38:02,951 --> 00:38:04,917
Because then you'll have proven

799
00:38:04,953 --> 00:38:05,918
that you deserve to know them.

800
00:38:05,954 --> 00:38:06,986
Please.

801
00:38:07,022 --> 00:38:08,288
Thanks for the birds.

802
00:38:09,958 --> 00:38:12,158
- Alice...
- No-no-no-no-no-no-no!

803
00:38:12,193 --> 00:38:13,293
Alice, we can talk about this...

804
00:38:13,328 --> 00:38:14,661
Just shut up! Shut up!

805
00:38:14,696 --> 00:38:16,663
Shut up!

806
00:38:16,698 --> 00:38:18,264
The sound of your voice,

807
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,600
your breath, your body,
your mind, your weakness,

808
00:38:20,635 --> 00:38:21,635
I can't stand it.

809
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:22,869
Stop it.

810
00:38:28,977 --> 00:38:30,777
Did you do that on purpose?

811
00:38:30,812 --> 00:38:32,812
No.

812
00:38:32,847 --> 00:38:33,946
Then wha...

813
00:38:33,982 --> 00:38:35,048
You know what this is.

814
00:38:35,083 --> 00:38:38,618
This is your body trying
to hold a niffin inside it.

815
00:38:38,653 --> 00:38:39,852
You can't.

816
00:38:39,888 --> 00:38:41,454
Not for much longer.

817
00:38:41,489 --> 00:38:43,256
Or it's gonna kill us both.

818
00:39:23,365 --> 00:39:25,832
Well? Did it work?

819
00:39:25,867 --> 00:39:26,999
No. But...

820
00:39:27,035 --> 00:39:28,835
Well, then, get out.

821
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,373
Okay, look.

822
00:39:33,408 --> 00:39:34,474
It's gonna be okay.

823
00:39:34,509 --> 00:39:36,676
I'm pregnant.

824
00:39:36,711 --> 00:39:39,412
We're about to go into war.
We need the king.

825
00:39:39,447 --> 00:39:42,014
I need my husband.

826
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:44,117
Well, you got me.

827
00:39:44,152 --> 00:39:47,186
I'm gonna take care of you and the kid.

828
00:39:47,222 --> 00:39:50,456
I will untangle this war shit somehow.

829
00:39:50,492 --> 00:39:53,025
I know the High King has the power,

830
00:39:53,061 --> 00:39:56,929
but I will hunt Ember
to the ends of the world

831
00:39:56,965 --> 00:40:00,333
to have that stupid rule rewritten.

832
00:40:02,504 --> 00:40:04,971
Everything El promised,

833
00:40:05,006 --> 00:40:06,873
I'm gonna deliver.

834
00:40:06,908 --> 00:40:08,107
You hear me?

835
00:40:08,143 --> 00:40:09,942
Yes.

836
00:40:09,978 --> 00:40:12,078
Listen to High King Bambi.

837
00:40:13,081 --> 00:40:15,114
You're alive.

838
00:40:17,252 --> 00:40:19,952
Nice of you to join us, asshole.

839
00:40:22,424 --> 00:40:25,291
Really does sound like
you got it all handled.

840
00:40:25,326 --> 00:40:26,893
I do.

841
00:40:26,928 --> 00:40:30,129
But it's more fun with you.

842
00:40:32,934 --> 00:40:35,067
From "The Book of Dana Wallens."

843
00:40:38,973 --> 00:40:41,073
"His adoptive mother christened him

844
00:40:41,109 --> 00:40:43,142
John Spencer Gaines."

845
00:40:43,178 --> 00:40:44,844
Oh, my God.

846
00:40:44,879 --> 00:40:46,012
You found his name.

847
00:40:46,047 --> 00:40:47,513
Stole, technically.

848
00:40:47,549 --> 00:40:50,850
But I think The Librarian
might let it slide

849
00:40:50,885 --> 00:40:53,252
since now I'm an employee.

850
00:40:53,288 --> 00:40:55,188
Wait... you...

851
00:40:55,223 --> 00:40:57,089
you signed that insane contract?

852
00:40:57,125 --> 00:40:58,125
Yeah, it's okay.

853
00:40:58,159 --> 00:40:59,926
How the hell is that okay?

854
00:40:59,961 --> 00:41:02,261
Because I get magic back.

855
00:41:02,297 --> 00:41:05,765
Least the Order's upfront
about what shit costs.

856
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,100
Plus, the way I see it,
I should already be dead by now.

857
00:41:08,136 --> 00:41:10,036
You know? So this is all bonus.

858
00:41:10,071 --> 00:41:13,272
Who gives a shit about all that future.

859
00:41:13,308 --> 00:41:15,508
Did you do this for me?

860
00:41:15,543 --> 00:41:18,044
Well, not just, but...

861
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,012
yeah. You know, yeah, I did.

862
00:41:20,048 --> 00:41:21,948
Were you not listening to a word I said?

863
00:41:21,983 --> 00:41:23,216
Yeah, I was listening.

864
00:41:23,251 --> 00:41:24,484
But guess what, it's not up to you

865
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:27,119
to decide if you're worth my time.

866
00:41:27,155 --> 00:41:30,022
I get to do whatever the fuck
I want with it,

867
00:41:30,058 --> 00:41:31,023
even if it is spend it on a girl

868
00:41:31,059 --> 00:41:33,292
that threatens to bail
all the goddamn time.

869
00:41:33,328 --> 00:41:35,228
'Cause guess what, Kady?

870
00:41:35,263 --> 00:41:38,130
I didn't think I was ever
gonna fucking see you again.

871
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:39,899
And that puts shit into perspective.

872
00:41:42,237 --> 00:41:44,036
I love you.

873
00:41:44,072 --> 00:41:45,972
Okay? Deal.

874
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:50,376
Shit.

875
00:41:57,018 --> 00:41:59,252
Okay, enough.

876
00:41:59,287 --> 00:42:01,087
What the fuck?

877
00:42:01,122 --> 00:42:02,822
- Can we do this another time?
- No.

878
00:42:02,857 --> 00:42:04,290
First your mind was weird,

879
00:42:04,325 --> 00:42:07,493
then it got locked up,
and now you're bleeding.

880
00:42:07,529 --> 00:42:08,995
Are you high? Are you possessed?

881
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,997
- What's...
- Why do you care?

882
00:42:11,032 --> 00:42:12,598
Because

883
00:42:12,634 --> 00:42:14,267
like it or not,

884
00:42:14,302 --> 00:42:16,168
we're the closest thing
you have to friends.

885
00:42:19,874 --> 00:42:22,942
Yeah, glass jaw. Not a surprise.

886
00:42:22,977 --> 00:42:25,578
Don't look at me. Incept him.

887
00:42:25,613 --> 00:42:28,981
I'll give it to you, you're practical.

888
00:42:35,323 --> 00:42:36,923
Get out of here! Right now!

889
00:42:39,561 --> 00:42:40,883
Alice is in there!

890
00:42:40,908 --> 00:42:42,295
What? I don't understand.

891
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:44,874
Neither do I, but she's in there
and she just tried to kill me!

892
00:42:44,899 --> 00:42:46,865
Okay, well, what the hell should we do?
