1
00:00:01,168 --> 00:00:02,608
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,803 --> 00:00:08,071
The High King and I hereby
declare war on the Kingdom of Loria!

3
00:00:08,208 --> 00:00:11,667
One cannot simply take
back a declaration of war.

4
00:00:11,912 --> 00:00:14,313
My hands can't
cast spells anymore.

5
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:16,541
Help me, I do what I can.

6
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:18,317
I'm a member of The Order,

7
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:20,354
the keepers of the
libraries of the Neitherlands,

8
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,013
the greatest repository
of knowledge.

9
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:23,089
You're a Niffin.

10
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:26,092
<i>Q, I'm not bloodthirsty.
I just want to be free.</i>

11
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:28,653
Penny! We're getting you out.

12
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,161
Well, I guess I
could help for a price.

13
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:34,497
I wanna drive. For an hour a
day, I get control of your body.

14
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:35,828
Fine. It's a deal.

15
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:37,371
We're gonna make another you.

16
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,306
<i>You sleep here, your
mind goes into the golem.</i>

17
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:44,336
Eliot!

18
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:48,211
In the center of your being,
there's a tiny beating heart.

19
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:49,816
<i>It's called a Shade.</i>

20
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:51,751
<i>It's what makes you feel</i>

21
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:54,287
<i>the pain will burn
you till there's nothing.</i>

22
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:55,751
<i>It's Reynard. He's back.</i>

23
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:57,084
He hurt you too, didn't he?

24
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,385
My child is safe.

25
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:00,890
He'll never know
who he really is.

26
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,427
<i>The test was positive.</i>

27
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:05,488
<i>You'll need to find a Mudang.</i>

28
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,294
But you can abort it, right?

29
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:09,069
This is exorcism.

30
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:11,066
That thing is not human.

31
00:01:11,538 --> 00:01:13,063
Did it work? Is it gone?

32
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,309
But, Julia, there
was a complication.

33
00:01:22,883 --> 00:01:24,603
What do you mean,
"lost her Shade"?

34
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,411
When the Mudang cut
the demigod's soul out,

35
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:30,985
they nicked hers by accident.

36
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:35,624
Her Shade, it's gone.

37
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,194
Is she gonna be, like...

38
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:42,164
Honestly,

39
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:44,331
I don't know.

40
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:52,305
Good morning.

41
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:55,682
Jesus, what day is it?

42
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,317
Friday. Are you...

43
00:01:59,186 --> 00:02:00,245
Listen,

44
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:03,557
I just want to thank you for
everything you did to help me.

45
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:06,383
You're looking at
me like I'm crazy.

46
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:10,287
I mean, are you?

47
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:11,922
How do you feel?

48
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:13,657
How do I feel?

49
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:16,660
I feel light.

50
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:19,736
Like a million-pound
weight's off my chest.

51
00:02:22,075 --> 00:02:24,670
Come. So, what you got?

52
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:26,141
Anything that skins foxes?

53
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:28,544
Yeah, well...

54
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:30,106
So, back in the day,

55
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:32,352
Zeus and his, well, frat bros,

56
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:36,254
they ran around kidnapping
and raping with total impunity.

57
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:39,885
So, the Magicians, they'd write these
spells to protect their communities.

58
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:41,354
God-killing spells.

59
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:46,099
The one thing that they all
have in common is they all failed.

60
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:48,958
Maybe it just can't be done.

61
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:51,671
You know what?

62
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,764
We need to write our
own. We can use these.

63
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,184
There's some
pretty big holes, but...

64
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,972
I mean, a little ambitious.

65
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,372
We need to be ambitious.

66
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:02,243
Like Martin Chatwin facing
Ember and Umber ambitious.

67
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,782
It can be done.

68
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,813
But, you know, say
we get the perfect spell.

69
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:08,913
Think about the energy
it'd take to work it.

70
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:10,820
Right. See, Dana knew that.

71
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:13,059
She had her power source. We...

72
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:15,091
I got rid of mine.

73
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:18,794
Well, what about Ember in
Fillory? Didn't he help Alice?

74
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:20,364
He's completely AWOL.

75
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:22,468
Hmm.

76
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:23,697
Oh, my God.

77
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:25,528
Dana's baby.

78
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,033
Reynard's son.

79
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:29,175
You know, there is a
ton of lore on demigods.

80
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,620
They're powerful
in their own right.

81
00:03:30,644 --> 00:03:32,613
Dana was talking
like he's still out there.

82
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:35,575
We need to find him.

83
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:42,421
Hurry up.

84
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,981
I checked your work, it's fine.

85
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:46,683
Nothing can break
a Word As Bond.

86
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:48,557
I must've overlooked something.

87
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,254
No hurting anyone.

88
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,889
No casting magic. No sex.

89
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,597
Trust me, you locked
down any possible fun.

90
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:58,138
I held up my end of the deal, Q.

91
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,671
Now it's your turn.
Or box me now,

92
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,870
because I'll drive you insane.

93
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:33,029
Midnight. My turn. Got it?

94
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,871
Quentin! Where the hell are you?

95
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:41,245
I'm just glad we managed
to sneak the golem out.

96
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:44,716
Is it me or is morgue
security ridiculously lax?

97
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:48,752
Well, I think stealing
corpses isn't generally a thing.

98
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:50,518
Should be, kind of fun.

99
00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:52,452
Anyway, according to the healer,

100
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:54,427
the bridge should take
a few days to enchant.

101
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,520
Then his consciousness
can travel it

102
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,531
from the clay back to his body.

103
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,196
And there's that.

104
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:05,536
Magic brownout.
Wellspring. Not helping.

105
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:07,673
How often does
that happen? Lately?

106
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,773
Sometimes twice a week.
Sometimes twice an hour.

107
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:13,110
Affects anything
that draws current.

108
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,376
Completely jacks all spellwork.

109
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:17,311
We're still trying to fix it.

110
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,747
Shall we go see the patient?

111
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:31,058
How's it going?

112
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:35,557
Every time the magic stutters, they
have to start the enchantment over.

113
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,266
Enchant faster.

114
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:39,839
Yes, Your Majesty.

115
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:43,554
Is there anything else
that we can be doing?

116
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:46,513
Hold off the war till he's back?

117
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,982
I had a pigeon drop a confusion
spell on the Lorian castle,

118
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,951
so they're moving
slow about now.

119
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:53,344
How can I help?

120
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,246
Honestly?

121
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,949
You can go back to
Brakebills and check on Julia.

122
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:00,922
You know you want to.

123
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:02,986
If anything changes...

124
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:05,692
I'll enchant a two-way
mirror to Brakebills,

125
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,930
like when Rupert yelled at Jane

126
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,833
through the vanity
table in the books.

127
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:13,734
Hey...

128
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,208
Don't worry.

129
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:21,805
My takeaway lately is that
anything can happen at any time.

130
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,875
So just be there for
your friend while you can.

131
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:29,913
Here.

132
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,191
Hey.

133
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,933
Hey. How is she?

134
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,004
Well, she is...

135
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,163
Holy shit!

136
00:06:47,774 --> 00:06:51,472
That info-matrixing spell
worked like a motherfucker.

137
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,043
Oh. Hey, Q. Hey.

138
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:57,050
So, I found a hospital
outside of Hoboken

139
00:06:57,117 --> 00:07:01,213
that took in a surrendered
newborn August 20th, 1976.

140
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:02,581
Holy shit.

141
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,356
Jules, what are
you... I have to go.

142
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,797
No, you need to
stay behind the wards.

143
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,700
Reynard is... Reynard
could give a shit about us.

144
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:21,671
Think. If he was gonna finish
me, he'd have done it by now.

145
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,935
So let's take advantage of that.

146
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:30,945
Uh, Jules, no. Look, she's
right. You're safer here.

147
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:34,778
No offense, Q, I didn't
actually ask your opinion.

148
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:35,979
Thanks, though.

149
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:37,756
Julia, wait!

150
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:53,038
Hi, Julia.

151
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:00,070
Thought I'd forgotten about you?

152
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,444
You seem like the
type to move on quick

153
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:03,592
when you're
finished with a girl.

154
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:06,245
Eh, generally.

155
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,422
Unless they're
carrying my child.

156
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:14,787
I was protecting you.

157
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,798
And what did you go
and do, you little bitch.

158
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,798
Now, Dana wouldn't tell
me what I wanted to know.

159
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:28,006
And it got very,
very painful for her.

160
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:32,039
But you have more common
sense than she does.

161
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,474
Tell me where her son is.

162
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,515
Hmm.

163
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,585
I don't know.

164
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:40,819
Mmm.

165
00:08:49,763 --> 00:08:50,822
You're different.

166
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:54,260
Someone's had a little,
uh, Shade amputation.

167
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:55,762
I like it.

168
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:00,806
I know you're there.

169
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,137
Boy.

170
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,038
Quentin.

171
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:09,748
All right, run. Go on, run.

172
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,544
I'll give you a head start.

173
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:21,125
I get it, you wanna
keep me safe.

174
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:26,092
Thank you. I'm saying, I just
can't sit on my thumbs in Fillory.

175
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:28,235
Look, you had the thing
before, the Haxenpaxen,

176
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:29,666
that was making you invisible.

177
00:09:29,836 --> 00:09:31,464
Right? So, we're in Fillory.

178
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:33,649
There's a lot of crazy shit
here, so find something else.

179
00:09:33,673 --> 00:09:35,437
Then you can go
back. You don't get it.

180
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:37,033
There isn't time.

181
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,143
Hmm. She's
right, Q, there isn't.

182
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,471
It's my turn soon.

183
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:41,847
Tick tock.

184
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,450
Uh, okay, look, I
am going to go back.

185
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:47,883
I'll help Kady. We're
gonna keep working.

186
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:53,286
Margo. Uh, Julia needs to stay
here for a while. It's an emergency.

187
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,958
Fine. Thank you.

188
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,455
Nice place.

189
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:04,862
Tick tock.

190
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,070
Dude, you okay?

191
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,175
I'm fine. Nothing to see here.

192
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:23,354
Using the gold you procured,

193
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:25,688
we have been able to
amply fund the infantry.

194
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,488
Now, as for Loria...

195
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,994
Some 8,000 troops are
headed to the border.

196
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:31,463
So we're totally outnumbered.

197
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:33,260
Perhaps not.

198
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:36,834
Our spies have spotted
their Master Magician Ilario

199
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:37,962
at the edge of the woods.

200
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:41,599
That bald illusionist dick who
disappeared the entire castle?

201
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:45,441
We suspect he has enhanced
the number of troops with trickery.

202
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:48,179
We believe the actual
numbers are under 3,000.

203
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:49,248
I like those odds.

204
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,875
There is also less good news.

205
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,446
Said troops appear
to be amassing

206
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,251
at the edge of the
One-Way-Forest.

207
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,590
A forest of intelligent trees.

208
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,183
Yeah, I've read about it.

209
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:02,459
Jane Chatwin tried
to pass once and...

210
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:06,727
Uh, the trees have a
long allegiance with Loria,

211
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,395
and, begging pardon, an
excessive dislike of Fillory.

212
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,371
Can you move the trees?

213
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,332
They are rooted, Your Highness.

214
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:16,808
Yeah, I mean with an ax.

215
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:20,675
That would be ill advised.
They are the last of their kind.

216
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:25,318
Her Languidness suggests
violence against the One-Way-Forest

217
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:27,286
could cause civil
war here in Fillory.

218
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,982
Well, in the books, the trees
had some sort of ambassador.

219
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:31,223
A dryad?

220
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:32,564
You need to negotiate with her.

221
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:36,024
Your Highness, we
would not advise a...

222
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,591
That worked for Jane?

223
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,360
Sold. Great.

224
00:11:40,767 --> 00:11:42,633
I'll come with you. Uh...

225
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,330
Custom strongly dictates that...

226
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:45,838
Yeah, I don't care.

227
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:48,259
Look, I know the books
almost as well as Quentin does.

228
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:49,867
I'm bored.

229
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,578
Let me be a little
useful, okay? Fine.

230
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:54,143
But I do the talking.

231
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:57,742
You just stand there and look
vaguely indignant or whatever.

232
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,718
Let's go.

233
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:08,422
Oh. Ah.

234
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:14,093
It wasn't enough.

235
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,235
I need more time.

236
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:18,337
To do what?

237
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:19,438
None of your business.

238
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,174
Relax. It's nothing.

239
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,883
What? I like to
read, is that a crime?

240
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:34,186
You can't be serious.

241
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:36,519
I have the right to know
what I've been doing.

242
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,053
All right, illuminated
manuscripts.

243
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,821
I remember this
from art history.

244
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:44,561
Yeah. A-plus for
you. I was just bored.

245
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:49,434
The monks got tired of writing the
same thing over and over again, so they

246
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:53,736
embellished in the margins.

247
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:56,269
Okay, well, a lot of
priests dabbled in magic.

248
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:57,602
Some exploded.

249
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:03,482
Yeah,

250
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,016
those monks were drama queens.

251
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:09,247
Okay. "There must be another
way to bring back our brother."

252
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:15,559
Are you looking for a
way to reverse it? No.

253
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,022
No, Q, I'm not.

254
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:20,909
Then why are you reading about all
these holy men trying to fix Niffins?

255
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:22,458
What does it matter, Q?

256
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,464
They always fail. Alice...

257
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,676
Oh, my God.

258
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,247
Welcome back,
Penny. I need a book.

259
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,284
<i>Future Movements in Magic.</i>

260
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,115
All right, follow me.

261
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,320
Don't they have a
copy at Brakebills?

262
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:47,451
It got destroyed.

263
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,054
I figure you guys have
every book here, so...

264
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,843
Unfortunately, you won't be
able to take this off the premises,

265
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,802
since you don't
have a library card.

266
00:13:56,969 --> 00:13:58,369
Oh, no, no. I got one. Um...

267
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:00,738
I'm just the errand boy.

268
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:02,574
Mayakovsky?

269
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:04,920
I'm surprised the
two of you get along.

270
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,344
No, we don't. Believe me.

271
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,475
My hands won't cast.

272
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:11,776
He's the only one
that can help me,

273
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,717
if I finish fetching his
goddamn grocery list

274
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,446
so we can get started, so...

275
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:16,814
Ah.

276
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,323
I can put a rush on this book.

277
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:21,421
Thank you. If you're sure
that's what you really want.

278
00:14:21,494 --> 00:14:23,292
Well, I really want
magic, so yeah.

279
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:26,065
But to pay for it with
servitude to a lying drunkard?

280
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:27,430
What's the alternative?

281
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:28,891
Us.

282
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:30,102
You?

283
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:32,766
Librarians?

284
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:35,832
The Order of the Library of the
Neitherlands are Master Magicians.

285
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:37,774
We can help you, Penny.

286
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:39,602
Okay.

287
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:42,247
What's the catch?

288
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,909
This contract initiates our
services in exchange for...

289
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:48,580
"Unlimited manual
and Magical labor?

290
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:52,488
"Bound in service to the
Library up to and after my death."

291
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,049
Are you kidding?
All very standard.

292
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,322
"For a period of no less
than one million years."

293
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,160
Okay, lady, are you joking?

294
00:14:58,464 --> 00:14:59,625
No!

295
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,900
Okay.

296
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:06,036
Okay. Here's what Julia found.

297
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:07,801
August 20th, 1976,

298
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,471
baby surrendered at hospital,

299
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:16,181
uh, a nurse, Michelle Walker,
transferred it to a state social worker.

300
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,544
Uh...

301
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:18,915
And after that...

302
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:20,984
Nothing. There's no
record of adoption...

303
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:24,147
Okay, so where's
Michelle Walker now?

304
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:29,523
Merciful Sisters Cemetery.

305
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,187
Oh, shit.

306
00:15:31,631 --> 00:15:32,724
Shit.

307
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:37,095
Shit what?

308
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,796
Just dead-ended again.

309
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,370
How's Mayakovsky?

310
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,103
Well, still a
jerk-off, you know.

311
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:47,809
What's wrong with you?

312
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:49,314
Hmm?

313
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:50,950
Your mind is...

314
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,564
- Doing something.
- Uh, no, it's not.

315
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:57,055
He's talking about me, Q.

316
00:15:57,824 --> 00:15:59,486
Stop that. Stop what?

317
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,994
Stop singing Imagine
Dragons to get me off the track.

318
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:03,791
Lock it up, Q. Seriously.

319
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:05,741
Look, why are you always
poking around in me anyway?

320
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:06,842
Can't you just leave me alone?

321
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:08,926
Oh, I'd love to.
You leak, asshole.

322
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,664
Okay, I have got to, uh...

323
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:17,203
The hell was that?

324
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,009
Something's wronger than usual.

325
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:21,641
And he's a grown man.

326
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,908
Moving on.

327
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:25,950
Have you eaten lately?

328
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,647
You should eat.

329
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:31,784
Penny, we still haven't...

330
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,452
You know, talked.

331
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,458
Uh... I thought
we weren't gonna.

332
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:43,264
Yeah, well, that was when
this was some quick fun,

333
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:46,966
not hanging out 24/7,
fucking our brains out,

334
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:48,337
robbing banks thing.

335
00:16:48,407 --> 00:16:49,500
That is fun.

336
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:51,735
That's funny.

337
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:54,078
Okay. Here's the deal.

338
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:57,650
I can't exactly study magic
unless I sign an insane contract,

339
00:16:57,717 --> 00:16:59,447
or Mayakovsky
stops dicking around.

340
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,686
What I can do is
help stop the evil freak

341
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:04,595
that tried to rip your
heart out of your chest.

342
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:06,785
I'll sleep better with
him dead. Simple.

343
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:09,491
You wanna keep things
professional? Fine.

344
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,323
It's no big deal.

345
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:16,027
Good.

346
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:33,445
Greetings.

347
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:37,485
I am Margo, High
Queen of Fillory.

348
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,457
<i>Habla Inglés</i> or what?

349
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:50,294
Hi.

350
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:51,696
So, you the nymph?

351
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:53,497
Dryad.

352
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,674
I thought you were all girls.
- Listen.

353
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,310
I know your tree
buddies don't like us...

354
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:59,777
The rulers of
Fillory have a long

355
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:01,837
and tragic history of
arboreal disrespect.

356
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,348
Yeah, okay.

357
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:04,815
Look, it's a new day.

358
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:06,910
We're a kinder, gentler Fillory.

359
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:09,887
So we need to settle some
unrest with our Lorian neighbors.

360
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:11,116
Settle unrest?

361
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:13,654
You mean wage war.

362
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:16,490
No, we mean button
some messy shit up.

363
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:17,853
Help us here.

364
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:19,455
We wanna make this work.

365
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:21,760
Respectfully. That's rich...

366
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:23,933
Considering your king apparently

367
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:25,801
wouldn't deign to
come here himself,

368
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,498
sending two females.

369
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:30,833
Hey.

370
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,401
This is Julia,

371
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,714
Royal Ambassador.

372
00:18:37,149 --> 00:18:39,641
And I am Fillory's one
and only High Queen.

373
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,711
Yes, the insult's been noted.

374
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:43,416
Passage is denied.

375
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,990
Good day.

376
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,161
Damn it.

377
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:52,521
Let's go.

378
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,012
Before you ask, no.

379
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,525
No luck with the adoption
records, no luck with the hospital,

380
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:11,847
and no luck with the nurse.

381
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:14,578
What's wrong with you?

382
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:16,621
Your wards are airtight.

383
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,100
You complained. So I fixed them.

384
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:20,004
Since when are you that
good at fixing anything?

385
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,839
Can we agree that I lose no matter
what I say and just stop talking?

386
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:24,656
So, Reynard's kid...

387
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:28,358
Yeah. So, the trail stops
when the nurse dies.

388
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,969
Shit. If only there was a way

389
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:31,470
to literally see into the past.

390
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:35,571
You know, I think I just
remembered. There might be a way.

391
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:36,870
Yeah, a time bridge?

392
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,934
We thought of that, there's
nothing close enough.

393
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,104
No, uh...

394
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,275
Time sight, literally.

395
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:43,815
We never studied that.

396
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,611
Uh, no, but I think Alice did.

397
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,851
Hmm, uh, can't remember.

398
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:50,014
Did she or didn't she?

399
00:19:50,156 --> 00:19:51,385
She did, uh.

400
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:53,083
I think it was,

401
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:57,691
uh, extra reading
in metageology?

402
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:58,856
Nope. Nope.

403
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:03,561
Um, oh, I think, or, it was an elective
in Basics in Vedic Prognostication.

404
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:05,571
Nope. Nope. Um.

405
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:07,937
Give me an extra hour
tonight and I'll tell you.

406
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:11,842
Hmm. Was it, uh, something
we learned in Sunderland's class.

407
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:13,021
I mean, because we
never studied any...

408
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,045
Are you, like...

409
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:16,675
Having an ADD
moment right now, or...

410
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:18,945
No. Um...

411
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:20,213
Okay, so here's the thing.

412
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:23,083
Um, there was this one
time, Alice and I, right,

413
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:26,850
we were studying, we
were sharing lab materials.

414
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:29,592
And people didn't know this about
Alice, but she was really greedy

415
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,359
with her lab materials.

416
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:36,662
Um, and so she would offer to
help me for extra time with them...

417
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,637
None of this is
interesting to any of us.

418
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:42,334
The point is, I would say,
"Twenty extra minutes,

419
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:45,705
"one time offer,
take it or leave it."

420
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:47,145
Thirty.

421
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:48,745
Fine. Deal.

422
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:53,114
Is how that would
go, in a nutshell.

423
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:54,847
Phosphoromancy.

424
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:56,422
My discipline, idiot.

425
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:59,348
McKellan's got a scope that
can bend light into the past.

426
00:20:59,525 --> 00:21:00,959
Phosphoromancy!

427
00:21:02,728 --> 00:21:04,924
Ugh. I'm an idiot. Correct.

428
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,896
Shut up, I remembered.

429
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:11,970
Uh, okay, so, the viewing device,
it's in Professor McKellan's office.

430
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:13,866
Ooh, Penny...

431
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,402
See, even he can't wait
to get away from you.

432
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:21,513
Is this thing gonna work or not?

433
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,613
Eliot has shit to do.

434
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,009
He has to do the
work of crossing back.

435
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:28,551
Not everyone chooses to do so.

436
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:29,687
Okay.

437
00:21:29,822 --> 00:21:31,290
Can you step out for a minute?

438
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:33,954
Fen, you too, sweetie.

439
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,759
Eliot.

440
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,196
You need to come back.

441
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:51,505
I know that you have a
constant low-key death wish,

442
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:53,239
but you can't leave.

443
00:21:55,381 --> 00:21:56,815
They don't want me.

444
00:21:58,584 --> 00:22:00,075
They want the High King.

445
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:12,592
I'm faking it, El.

446
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,237
So if you could just

447
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:21,672
please,

448
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,874
please wake up.

449
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:40,354
I set it to August 20th, 1976.

450
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:46,863
Holy shit.

451
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,631
What? What do you see?

452
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:53,400
Uh, just people waiting.

453
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:03,476
Yeah, here we go.

454
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:05,076
What?

455
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,312
Uh, nurse with a baby.

456
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:18,029
Uh...

457
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:20,098
What?

458
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,803
You gotta be kidding me.

459
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:27,200
What?

460
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:28,802
What's wrong?

461
00:23:33,312 --> 00:23:34,371
Ah, shit.

462
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,341
Dana did this.

463
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:39,216
To protect the baby's identity.

464
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:41,811
Even from spells 40
years in the future.

465
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:43,955
She thought of everything.

466
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,887
And back to square nothing.

467
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:18,190
Hi, I'm Julia.

468
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:21,957
God, been waiting hours for
you to get close enough to grab.

469
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:23,828
Think my foot fell asleep.

470
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:25,363
I will never help Fillory.

471
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:26,792
I'd sooner be skinned.

472
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,094
All right, boys, let him go.

473
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:30,928
Give us some air,
but stay close-ish.

474
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:34,971
Hate Fillory all you want.

475
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,776
I'm here for one thing
and then I'm off this planet.

476
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,877
An invisibility spell.

477
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:41,775
Strong enough
to hide from a god.

478
00:24:43,282 --> 00:24:44,559
And why should I give it to you?

479
00:24:44,583 --> 00:24:46,779
Because I might not
give a shit about Fillory,

480
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,178
but I do, as its
Royal Ambassador,

481
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:52,190
have access to its
guards and its dungeons,

482
00:24:52,358 --> 00:24:54,691
and I'll use A to
throw you in B.

483
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,819
But help me, and
I'll let you go free.

484
00:24:57,930 --> 00:24:58,954
I don't believe you.

485
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:01,159
Your loyalty will always
lie with... With me.

486
00:25:01,533 --> 00:25:03,695
My loyalty will
always lie with me.

487
00:25:30,896 --> 00:25:32,762
Drill a hole in it. Wear it.

488
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:34,228
No god can sense you.

489
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:35,660
Thank you.

490
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:39,037
You're free to go.

491
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,348
Hey, dryad boy!

492
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:53,846
Come on out. I saw
you in there, sweetheart.

493
00:25:58,323 --> 00:25:59,814
Negotiations are over.

494
00:26:00,826 --> 00:26:01,850
Go home.

495
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:03,394
I brought you something.

496
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:09,296
A small token of peace.

497
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:10,597
It won't change anything.

498
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,800
Just give it to your bosses.

499
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,904
I'm trying to fix this.

500
00:26:25,184 --> 00:26:26,184
Thank you.

501
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:09,227
I've been looking for you.

502
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:15,677
You've lived here since
the Bush administration,

503
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:17,101
but you're thousands
of years old.

504
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,535
You're an Anglerbeast.

505
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:25,171
That's stupid.

506
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:27,808
You play too much
<i>Dungeons and Dragons.</i>

507
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:33,310
You knew a man, a long time ago.

508
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:35,614
He was special, and
he lived in a monastery,

509
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:37,346
a Master Magician.

510
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:39,422
Friar Joseph.

511
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:41,488
Ring a bell?

512
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:47,663
I wanna know
everything about him.

513
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,134
Well, in the
parlance of your time,

514
00:27:51,937 --> 00:27:53,803
fuck you, pay me.

515
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:57,669
Fresh meat.

516
00:27:58,644 --> 00:28:00,408
Newborns are the sweetest.

517
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:05,411
You know, I thought
about doing that.

518
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,183
But my time is very limited.

519
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,687
So I researched your
weak spots instead.

520
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:14,520
And you believed what you read?

521
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,167
That was stupid of you.

522
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:41,410
Oh, my God!

523
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:45,951
Alice, what did you do?

524
00:28:46,158 --> 00:28:47,182
Relax.

525
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:50,059
Can't hurt anybody, remember?

526
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:53,431
But she's... A monster.

527
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:55,465
Technically I did good here.

528
00:28:55,534 --> 00:28:58,299
I mean, there's a ton of
kid bones in this sandbox.

529
00:28:58,704 --> 00:29:01,765
It wasn't cooperating,
so I had to use

530
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:04,905
enhanced
interrogation techniques.

531
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:07,204
To find out what?

532
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,908
We might wanna go before
the rest of it lumbers up here.

533
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,743
It's pretty mad at me.

534
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:18,575
What the hell were
you thinking, huh?

535
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,452
You burned down
the One-Way-Forest

536
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:23,051
while I'm trying to wiggle
us out of a full-on war?

537
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:26,156
Those trees were dicks.

538
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:27,790
They were endangered!

539
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:31,336
Now trees all over Fillory are
enraged and calling for action.

540
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:34,202
Do you have any idea
what you did, Julia?

541
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:35,339
Yeah.

542
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:36,907
I helped you.

543
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:38,833
Now you can cross into Loria

544
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:40,788
and kick their fucking
asses like you wanted to.

545
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:43,372
This is not how I
wanted to go about that.

546
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,178
Yeah, I know.

547
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,811
So, the really good news
is you didn't do anything.

548
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:52,449
Go back and tell the angry
tree lobby it was all crazy Julia.

549
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,482
You're welcome.

550
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:57,622
Look, I got what I wanted.
The rest was all a favor to you.

551
00:29:57,696 --> 00:29:59,426
So banish me forever.

552
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:01,726
Send me home.

553
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,793
You know, in a sick way

554
00:30:04,603 --> 00:30:06,162
I sort of admire you.

555
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:10,270
That being said, here's what
we do to loose cannons in Fillory.

556
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:11,401
Ready?

557
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,010
Guards!

558
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,248
Take this bitch to the dungeon.

559
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,109
You've got to be kidding me.

560
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:22,484
Now if you'll excuse me, I
have some damage control to do.

561
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:28,851
How to break a Word As Bond.

562
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:34,298
Reversing a Word As Bond.

563
00:30:35,267 --> 00:30:36,963
Amending a Word As Bond.

564
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:38,498
It's not there.

565
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:40,369
That's the whole point.

566
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,803
You can't break it.

567
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,540
Why don't you do
something useful

568
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:46,737
and catch up on all the
classes you missed in Fillory?

569
00:30:48,046 --> 00:30:50,345
This isn't working.
Yeah, tell me about it.

570
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:53,255
Keeping you a secret and trying to
help you while you do God knows what.

571
00:30:55,387 --> 00:30:57,652
I have to ask for help.
I need to tell someone.

572
00:30:57,723 --> 00:30:59,021
Great idea.

573
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,088
You think you know
locked up for crazy?

574
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:02,904
They'll put you someplace
you can't even imagine,

575
00:31:02,928 --> 00:31:04,405
and they'll box
me up so quick...

576
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:06,174
All your efforts for nothing.
Is that what you want?

577
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:09,066
I want Alice back. I want
the real you. I want, I...

578
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:14,066
I can't help Fillory,
and I can't help Eliot,

579
00:31:14,139 --> 00:31:15,539
and I can't help Julia.

580
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:17,269
And I just wanna do...

581
00:31:17,943 --> 00:31:20,054
God, one thing for the person
that deserves it the most.

582
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:21,273
That's what I want.

583
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:24,816
God.

584
00:31:27,786 --> 00:31:28,845
I understand.

585
00:31:32,157 --> 00:31:33,455
Do you wanna know the truth?

586
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:36,595
You are a failure.

587
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:39,554
So stop using me
to try to fix that.

588
00:31:40,866 --> 00:31:42,232
Uh-oh, look at the time.

589
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,168
Uh, wait, no. Word
As Bond, kid. My turn.

590
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,571
What are we drinking to?

591
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:59,348
Dead ends.

592
00:32:04,623 --> 00:32:05,716
What?

593
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:06,983
I'm adjusting.

594
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:08,559
You used to hold
your liquor better.

595
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:10,958
Yeah, well, I used
to drink for fun.

596
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:16,624
Now I drink to get too fucked up
to go out and do anything worse.

597
00:32:18,503 --> 00:32:20,972
Oh, God, I hope
this works as a mixer.

598
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:26,243
Oh...

599
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,971
Did I forget to mention
that I have to take this now?

600
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:30,877
Because I'm a junkie.

601
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:32,782
Ah.

602
00:32:32,851 --> 00:32:35,013
Just trying to stay
straight long enough

603
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,679
to find Reynard without
falling the fuck apart.

604
00:32:38,757 --> 00:32:41,659
Kady, we're gonna find the son.

605
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,460
You think?

606
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:45,887
I think

607
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:47,798
you and me,

608
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:49,733
put our minds together,

609
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:51,630
shit gets done.

610
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:53,003
Oh, God.

611
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:56,368
That is so stupid, it's sad.

612
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:59,039
And I don't think
you were listening

613
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,830
when I said I'm not
your fucking girlfriend.

614
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:02,245
Well, good. I don't want one.

615
00:33:02,881 --> 00:33:04,975
Oh, God. Yeah, I get it.

616
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:07,950
Yeah, you're very tough, right?

617
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:11,021
Oh, God. Yeah, you're real cool.

618
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:13,153
You're not hearing me.

619
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:16,428
I am not your problem.

620
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:20,657
This isn't your chance to prove
that you're some kind of hero.

621
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:24,732
You want your dick
sucked, great, I can do that.

622
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:28,129
Then I'd love it
if you'd fuck off.

623
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,381
<i>I am Liam McFarland
for</i> BBC World News...

624
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:01,998
I had him stop
for fish and chips.

625
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:03,775
Best shop in Dublin, he said.

626
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:05,637
Are you kidding me?

627
00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:10,380
Wait, uh, no, no. Just, uh,
just wait here for a second.

628
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:13,845
You portaled us to Ireland?

629
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:17,678
To do what? Where
are we going? Home.

630
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,354
It's done. We already did it.

631
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:20,591
Did what?

632
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,753
Alice, what did you do?

633
00:34:26,131 --> 00:34:29,829
Uh, oh, uh, sir, where
did we just come from?

634
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,563
About three streets that way.

635
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:33,730
Great. Can we go back there now?

636
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,005
Right.

637
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:37,676
Wait, Quentin, no.
I'm serious, don't.

638
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,976
Q, stop. Hold on.

639
00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:43,313
Q, please, wait.

640
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:45,775
Please. Quentin, don't.

641
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:04,430
You... Tricked you
with reverse psychology.

642
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:08,267
It was shockingly easy.
"No, don't go. Please."

643
00:35:08,406 --> 00:35:10,034
Alice, what did you do? Nothing.

644
00:35:10,342 --> 00:35:12,675
I can't do magic, remember?
I'm stuck inside you.

645
00:35:13,378 --> 00:35:14,378
So you did it.

646
00:35:16,381 --> 00:35:19,943
I believe you called to me
with something personal

647
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:22,446
at the place of
my transformation.

648
00:35:25,657 --> 00:35:27,455
The music you got wrong.

649
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:29,089
Ponderous.

650
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:32,559
Ah, but the birds.
I did love those.

651
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:39,202
All my life I thought them
God's most perfect works of art.

652
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:42,205
Just look at them.

653
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:46,511
Bit annoying though,
all that cooing.

654
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,881
Now, why did you summon me?

655
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,014
Or didn't you mean to do that?

656
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:55,380
Maybe it was you.

657
00:35:56,021 --> 00:35:58,252
You can see me.

658
00:35:58,323 --> 00:35:59,416
Of course I can.

659
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:02,453
What on Earth are you
doing inside this boy?

660
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,859
Friar Joseph, I've
been searching for you.

661
00:36:05,063 --> 00:36:07,089
I need your help. With him.

662
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:10,501
This crushable
little field mouse?

663
00:36:12,137 --> 00:36:13,696
<i>Seni baglamak.</i> I bind you.

664
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:16,508
<i>Seni baglamak.</i> I bind you!

665
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:20,109
Silly boy.

666
00:36:20,412 --> 00:36:22,972
I can't be boxed.

667
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:28,014
I read about you.

668
00:36:28,286 --> 00:36:30,551
Priests studying magic
till they've gone too far.

669
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,448
That their brothers
have to box them.

670
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:34,755
Except sometimes the
boxing doesn't go right.

671
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:38,387
Yes, the occasional
Niffin did slip through.

672
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:39,723
That's what I thought.

673
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,232
Until I figured out that

674
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:44,602
it wasn't a handful who
escaped. It was just you.

675
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,338
You slipped away
over and over again

676
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:49,079
because you figured
out how to do it.

677
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:51,740
You can't be boxed.

678
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:54,174
I need you to teach me.

679
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:55,656
Al... Will you make him shut up?

680
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,360
I can't do anything
in here. No, I won't...

681
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,320
I'll do anything.

682
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:04,855
I'm serious.

683
00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:13,197
Shit.

684
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:15,984
Let him go. If he passes out, I
won't be able to talk to you anymore.

685
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:21,937
Please show me how you do it.

686
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:25,275
I've been like this
for six centuries.

687
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:29,175
The things that I know
now you cannot imagine.

688
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,510
That's what I want.

689
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,216
Please, can I go with you?

690
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:34,912
You, with me?

691
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:40,949
You can't even get out of
this shoddy little Magician.

692
00:37:41,426 --> 00:37:44,021
How smart, how
able could you be?

693
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:47,788
How could you help me
with anything worthwhile?

694
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,626
No, no, listen to me.
It's not that simple.

695
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:51,726
But it is.

696
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:53,798
Free yourself.

697
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:56,435
But I can't! The trap is...

698
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:58,067
Find a way.

699
00:37:58,243 --> 00:37:59,575
Then find me.

700
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:02,377
Then I will show
you a secret or two.

701
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:05,874
Because then you'll have proven
that you deserve to know them.

702
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,111
Please!

703
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:09,177
Thanks for the birds.

704
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,855
Alice. No. No, no, no, no, no!

705
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:14,268
Alice, we can talk about
this. Just shut up! Shut up!

706
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,193
Shut up!

707
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:18,020
The sound of your voice!

708
00:38:18,229 --> 00:38:19,959
Your breath, your
body, your mind,

709
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:21,363
your weakness, I can't stand it!

710
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:22,466
Stop it!

711
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:30,466
Did you do that on purpose?

712
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:32,268
No.

713
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:34,837
Then... You know what this is?

714
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:38,046
This is your body trying
to hold a Niffin inside it.

715
00:38:38,383 --> 00:38:39,442
You can't.

716
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:40,949
Not for much longer,

717
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:42,854
or it's gonna kill us both.

718
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:25,587
Well? Did it work?

719
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:26,897
No. But...

720
00:39:26,965 --> 00:39:28,228
Well, then get out.

721
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:33,195
Okay, look.

722
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:34,495
It's gonna be okay.

723
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:35,938
I'm pregnant.

724
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:39,272
We're about to go into
war. We need the King.

725
00:39:39,644 --> 00:39:41,112
I need my husband.

726
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,709
Well, you got me.

727
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:46,708
I'm gonna take care
of you and the kid.

728
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:50,411
I will untangle this
war shit somehow.

729
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:52,918
I know the High
King has the power,

730
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:56,826
but I will hunt Ember
to the ends of the world

731
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:59,692
to have that stupid
rule rewritten.

732
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,628
Everything El promised,

733
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:07,666
I'm gonna deliver. You hear me?

734
00:40:08,206 --> 00:40:09,299
Yeah.

735
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,672
Listen to High King Bambi.

736
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,511
You're alive!

737
00:40:17,215 --> 00:40:19,684
Nice of you to join us, asshole.

738
00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:25,052
Really does sound like
you've got it all handled.

739
00:40:25,223 --> 00:40:26,316
I do.

740
00:40:26,691 --> 00:40:28,523
But it's more fun with you.

741
00:40:33,231 --> 00:40:34,927
From the book of Dana Wallens.

742
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:42,474
"His adoptive mother christened
him John Spencer Gaines."

743
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:44,336
Oh, my God.

744
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:45,933
You found his name.

745
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:47,535
Stole, technically.

746
00:40:47,879 --> 00:40:52,317
But I think The Librarian might let
it slide, since now I'm an employee.

747
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,284
What?

748
00:40:54,352 --> 00:40:57,754
You signed that insane
contract? Yeah, it's okay.

749
00:40:57,855 --> 00:40:59,483
How the hell is that okay?

750
00:40:59,557 --> 00:41:00,991
Because I get magic back.

751
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:04,853
At least The Order's
upfront about what shit costs.

752
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:08,192
Plus, the way I see it, I should
already be dead by now, you know?

753
00:41:08,266 --> 00:41:09,564
So, this is all bonus.

754
00:41:09,901 --> 00:41:11,893
Who gives a shit
about all that future?

755
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:14,736
Did you do this for me?

756
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,908
Not just. But...

757
00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:19,737
Yeah. You know, yeah, I did.

758
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:21,780
Were you not listening
to a word I said?

759
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:22,846
Yeah, I was listening.

760
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:26,180
But guess what, it's not up to you
to decide if you're worth my time.

761
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:29,414
I get to do whatever
the fuck I want with it.

762
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:33,451
Even if it is spend it on a girl that
threatens to bail all the goddamn time.

763
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:35,232
Because, guess what, Kady?

764
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:37,379
I didn't think I was ever
gonna fucking see you again.

765
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:39,624
And that put shit
into perspective.

766
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,324
I love you.

767
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:45,336
Okay? Deal.

768
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,233
Shit.

769
00:41:57,648 --> 00:41:58,980
Okay. Enough.

770
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,545
What the fuck?

771
00:42:00,952 --> 00:42:02,592
Can we do this some other time?
- No.

772
00:42:02,754 --> 00:42:04,017
First your mind was weird,

773
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:06,216
then it got locked up,
and now you're bleeding.

774
00:42:07,425 --> 00:42:09,155
Are you high, are you
possessed? What's...

775
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,455
Why do you care?

776
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:13,555
Because, like it or not,

777
00:42:14,232 --> 00:42:15,952
we're the closest thing
you have to friends.

778
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,671
Yeah, glass jaw. Not a surprise.

779
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,365
Don't look at me. Incept him.

780
00:42:26,344 --> 00:42:27,835
I'll give it to you,
you're practical.

781
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:37,686
Get out of here right now!

782
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,517
Alice is in there!

783
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:42,125
What? I don't understand.

784
00:42:42,193 --> 00:42:44,238
Neither do I, but she's in there,
and she just tried to kill me!

785
00:42:44,262 --> 00:42:46,356
Okay. Well, what
the hell should we do?
