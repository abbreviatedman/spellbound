1
00:00:00,567 --> 00:00:04,136
<i>- Previously on
"The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:04,138 --> 00:00:06,071
- The high king and I
hereby declare war

3
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:07,740
on the kingdom of Loria.

4
00:00:07,742 --> 00:00:11,276
- One cannot simply take back
a declaration of war.

5
00:00:11,278 --> 00:00:14,146
- My hands can't
cast spells anymore.

6
00:00:14,148 --> 00:00:16,448
<i>- Help me, I do what I can.</i>

7
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,183
- I'm a member of the order,

8
00:00:18,185 --> 00:00:20,319
the keepers of the libraries
of the Neitherlands,

9
00:00:20,321 --> 00:00:21,553
the greatest repository
of knowledge.

10
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:23,489
<i>- You're a niffin.</i>

11
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:26,091
<i>- Q, I'm not blood-thirsty,
I just want to be free.</i>

12
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:27,092
- Penny!

13
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:28,427
<i>We're getting you out!</i>

14
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:30,763
- I guess I could help,
for a price.

15
00:00:30,765 --> 00:00:32,364
I want to drive.

16
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,433
For an hour a day,
I get control of your body.

17
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:35,567
- Fine, it's a deal.

18
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:37,403
<i>- We're gonna make another you.</i>

19
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:40,205
<i>- You sleep here, your mind
goes into the golem.</i>

20
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:44,209
- Eliot!

21
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:45,511
- In the center of your being,

22
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:47,546
there's a tiny beating heart.

23
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,515
<i>It's called "a shade."</i>

24
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:51,283
<i>It's what makes you feel.</i>

25
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:54,086
<i>The pain will burn you
till there's nothing.</i>

26
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:55,521
- It's Reynard, he's back.

27
00:00:55,523 --> 00:00:56,622
He hurt you too, didn't he?

28
00:00:56,624 --> 00:00:58,257
- My child is safe.

29
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:00,426
He'll never know
who he really is.

30
00:01:00,428 --> 00:01:02,127
<i>- The test was positive.</i>

31
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,264
<i>- You will need to find
a mudang.</i>

32
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:07,132
- But you can abort it, right?

33
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:08,567
- This is exorcism.

34
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,836
That thing is not human.

35
00:01:10,838 --> 00:01:13,806
- Did it work?
- Is it gone?

36
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:17,276
- But, Julia,
there was a complication.

37
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:24,316
<i>- What do you mean,
lost her shade?</i>

38
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:27,419
- When the mudang
cut the demigod's soul out,

39
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:31,824
they... they nicked hers
by accident.

40
00:01:31,826 --> 00:01:34,326
Her shade,

41
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:37,129
it's gone.

42
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:39,865
- Is she gonna be, like...

43
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:42,334
- Honestly, I...

44
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:44,236
I don't know.

45
00:01:50,311 --> 00:01:52,678
Good morning.

46
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,213
Hey, Jesus,

47
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:55,581
what day is it?

48
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,149
- It's Friday.

49
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:58,484
Are you...

50
00:01:58,486 --> 00:02:01,320
- Listen,
I just want to thank you

51
00:02:01,322 --> 00:02:03,622
for everything you did
to help me.

52
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:06,658
You're looking at me
like I'm crazy.

53
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:10,162
I mean, are you?

54
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:12,297
How do you feel?

55
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:13,599
How do I feel?

56
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:16,435
I feel light.

57
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:19,471
Like a million pound weight's
off my chest.

58
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:22,608
Come.

59
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,510
So what'd you get?

60
00:02:24,512 --> 00:02:26,211
Anything that skins foxes?

61
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:28,347
- Well...

62
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:30,215
So back in the day,

63
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:32,217
Zeus and his little frat bros,

64
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:34,653
they ran around
kidnapping and raping

65
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,622
with total impunity,
so The Magicians,

66
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:39,525
they read these spells
to protect their communities,

67
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:41,660
god-killing spells.

68
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:44,563
The one thing that
they all have in common is

69
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:46,899
they all failed.

70
00:02:46,901 --> 00:02:50,369
Maybe it just can't be done.

71
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:52,437
- You know what?
- We need to write our own.

72
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:54,640
We can use these, there's
some pretty big holes, but...

73
00:02:54,642 --> 00:02:56,708
- I mean, a little ambitious.

74
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,244
- We need to be ambitious,

75
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:02,181
like Martin Chatwin facing
ember and umber ambitious.

76
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:03,649
It can be done.

77
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:06,485
But, you know, say
we get the perfect spell,

78
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:08,620
think about the energy
it'd take to work it.

79
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:10,556
- Right.
- See, Dana knew that.

80
00:03:10,558 --> 00:03:11,924
She had her power source.

81
00:03:11,926 --> 00:03:15,460
We... I... got rid of mine.

82
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:17,496
- Well, what about
ember in Fillory,

83
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:18,497
didn't he help Alice?

84
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:20,365
- He's completely awol.

85
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,769
Oh, my god.

86
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:26,705
Dana's baby, Reynard's son.

87
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,640
- And there is a ton
of lore on demigods.

88
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:30,409
They're powerful
in their own right.

89
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:33,212
- Dana was talking
like he's still out there.

90
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:35,681
We need to find him.

91
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,754
- Hurry up.

92
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,790
I checked your work, it's fine.

93
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:46,425
Nothing can break
a word as bond.

94
00:03:46,427 --> 00:03:48,393
- I must've
overlooked something.

95
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,729
- No hurting anyone.
- No casting magic.

96
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,297
No sex.

97
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:55,334
Trust me, you locked down
any possible fun.

98
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:57,736
I held up my end of the deal, Q.

99
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,371
Now it's your turn.

100
00:03:59,373 --> 00:04:00,706
Or box me now

101
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,742
'cause I'll drive you insane.

102
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:32,838
Midnight, my turn.
Got it?

103
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:38,477
<i>- Quentin!
- Where the hell are you?</i>

104
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,846
I'm just glad we managed
to sneak the golem out.

105
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:45,017
Is it me or is morgue security
ridiculously lax?

106
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:48,487
- Well, I think stealing corpses
isn't generally a thing.

107
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:50,389
- Should be.
- Kind of fun.

108
00:04:50,391 --> 00:04:52,057
Anyway, according the healer,

109
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:54,026
the bridge should take
a few days to enchant.

110
00:04:54,028 --> 00:04:56,328
Then his consciousness
can travel it

111
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,563
from the Clay back to his body.

112
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:02,301
And there's that.

113
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:04,403
Magic brownout.
Wellspring.

114
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:05,437
Not helping.

115
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,638
- How often does that happen?

116
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,774
- Lately?
- Sometimes twice a week.

117
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:10,776
Sometimes twice an hour.

118
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:12,644
Affects anything
that draws current.

119
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,080
Completely Jacks all spellwork.

120
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:17,516
We're still trying to fix it.

121
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:19,751
Shall we go see the patient?

122
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:31,563
How's it going?

123
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:33,398
- Every time the magic stutters,

124
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,101
they have to start
the enchantment over.

125
00:05:36,103 --> 00:05:38,370
- Enchant faster.

126
00:05:38,372 --> 00:05:40,806
- Yes, your majesty.

127
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:43,542
- Is there anything else
that we can be doing?

128
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:45,410
- Hold off the war
till he's back.

129
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:48,447
- I had a pigeon
drop a confusion spell

130
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:51,683
on the lorian castle so
they're moving slow about now.

131
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,352
- How can I help?

132
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:55,821
- Honestly?

133
00:05:55,823 --> 00:05:58,890
You can go back to Brakebills
and check on Julia.

134
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:00,926
You know you want to.

135
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:02,761
- If anything changes...

136
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:05,764
- I'll enchant a two-way mirror
to Brakebills,

137
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:07,532
like when Rupert yelled at Jane

138
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,501
through the vanity table
in the books.

139
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,573
Hey,

140
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16,875
don't worry.

141
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:20,479
My takeaway lately
is that anything can happen

142
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:22,881
at any time.

143
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,450
So just be there
for your friend while you can.

144
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:29,921
Here.

145
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:40,532
- Hey.

146
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:41,633
- Hey.

147
00:06:41,635 --> 00:06:42,901
- How is she?

148
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:44,870
- Oh, well, she's...

149
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:47,472
Holy shit.

150
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:49,474
That infomatrixing spell

151
00:06:49,476 --> 00:06:51,610
worked like a motherfucker.

152
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:53,678
- Oh, hey, Q.
- Hey.

153
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,681
- So I found a hospital
outside of Hoboken

154
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:58,483
that took in
a surrendered newborn

155
00:06:58,485 --> 00:07:00,886
August 20, 1976.

156
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:02,821
- Holy shit.

157
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:12,197
- Jules, what are you...
- I have to go.

158
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,666
- No, you need to
stay behind the wards.

159
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:15,834
Reynard is...

160
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:17,803
- Reynard could give a shit
about us.

161
00:07:17,805 --> 00:07:18,804
Think.

162
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:20,505
If he was gonna finish me,

163
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:21,573
he'd have done it by now.

164
00:07:21,575 --> 00:07:23,942
So let's take advantage of that.

165
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:29,581
- Uh, Jules, no, look,
she's right.

166
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:31,550
You're safer here.

167
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:32,784
- No offense, Q,

168
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,619
I didn't actually
ask your opinion.

169
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,521
Thanks, though.

170
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:37,523
- Julia, wait.

171
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:53,038
- Hi, Julia.

172
00:07:57,743 --> 00:08:00,212
You thought I'd
forgotten about you?

173
00:08:00,214 --> 00:08:01,012
- You seem like the type

174
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,547
to move on quick

175
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:03,829
when you're finished
with a girl.

176
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:06,952
Eh, generally.

177
00:08:06,954 --> 00:08:08,987
Unless they're
carrying my child.

178
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:15,627
I was protecting you.

179
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:16,828
And what did you go and do,

180
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,797
you little bitch?

181
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:21,032
Now, Dana

182
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,735
wouldn't tell me
what I wanted to know.

183
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:27,806
And it got
very, very painful for her.

184
00:08:27,808 --> 00:08:29,808
But you have more

185
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,910
common sense than she does.

186
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:34,846
Tell me where her son is.

187
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:36,581
- Hm.

188
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:39,284
I don't know.

189
00:08:39,286 --> 00:08:40,652
- Mm.

190
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,729
You're different.

191
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:52,564
Someone's had a little, uh,

192
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:53,965
shade amputation.

193
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,800
I like it.

194
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:00,906
I know you're there.

195
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:03,108
Boy.

196
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,676
Quentin.

197
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:07,879
All right, run.

198
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,881
Go on, run.

199
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,651
I'll give you a head start.

200
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:20,792
<i>- I get it.
- You want to keep me safe.</i>

201
00:09:20,794 --> 00:09:22,093
Thank you.

202
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:23,929
I'm saying, I just can't

203
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:25,931
sit on my thumbs in Fillory.

204
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:27,866
- Look, you had the thing
before, the haxenpaxen,

205
00:09:27,868 --> 00:09:29,768
that... that was
making you invisible, right?

206
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:30,936
So we're in Fillory.

207
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:32,337
There's a lot
of crazy shit here.

208
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:33,905
So find something else.
Then you can go back.

209
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:35,106
- You don't get it.

210
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:36,775
There isn't time.

211
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:38,810
- Hm.
- She's right, Q, there isn't.

212
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,345
It's my turn soon.

213
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:41,880
Tick tock.

214
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:43,648
- Uh, okay, look,

215
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,917
I am going to go back.
I'll help Kady.

216
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,652
We're... we're gonna
keep working.

217
00:09:47,654 --> 00:09:48,987
Margo.

218
00:09:48,989 --> 00:09:51,723
Uh, Julia needs
to stay here for a while.

219
00:09:51,725 --> 00:09:53,091
It's an emergency.

220
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,126
- Fine.
- Thank you.

221
00:09:57,965 --> 00:09:59,698
- It's a nice place.

222
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,604
- Tick tock.

223
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,145
- Dude, are you okay?

224
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:19,684
- I'm fine.
- Nothing to see here.

225
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:23,054
- Using the gold you procured,

226
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:25,657
we have been able
to amply fund the infantry.

227
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:27,058
Now, as for Loria...

228
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,828
- Some 8,000 troops
are headed to the border.

229
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,029
- So we're totally outnumbered.

230
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:33,064
- Perhaps not.

231
00:10:33,066 --> 00:10:36,635
Our spies have spotted
the master magician Illario

232
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:37,769
at the edge of the woods.

233
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:39,371
- That bald illusionist dick

234
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:41,172
who disappeared
the entire castle?

235
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:44,042
- We suspect he has enhanced
the number of troops

236
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:45,744
with trickery.

237
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:47,979
- We believe the actual numbers
are under 3,000.

238
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,014
- I like those odds.

239
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:51,883
- There is also less good news.

240
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:54,052
Said troops
appear to be amassing

241
00:10:54,054 --> 00:10:56,187
at the edge of
the one-way-forest.

242
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:58,223
A forest of intelligent trees.

243
00:10:58,225 --> 00:11:00,125
- Yeah, I've read about it.

244
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:02,060
Jane Chatwin
tried to pass once and...

245
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:04,396
- uhh, the trees have a

246
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:06,231
long allegiance with Loria

247
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:10,035
and, begging pardon,
an excessive dislike of Fillory.

248
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:12,137
- Can you move the trees?

249
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:14,205
- They are rooted,
your highness.

250
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:16,941
- Yeah.
- I mean with an ax.

251
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:19,711
- That would be ill advised.
- They are the last of their kind.

252
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:23,014
- Her languidness suggests

253
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,983
violence against
the one-way-forest

254
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:26,951
could cause civil war
here in Fillory.

255
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:28,420
- Well, in the books,
the trees had

256
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:30,955
some sort of ambassador,
a dryad.

257
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:32,257
You need to negotiate with her.

258
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:35,026
- Your highness,
we would not advise...

259
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:38,863
- that worked for Jane?

260
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,098
- Sold.
- Great.

261
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,266
I'll come with you.

262
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:44,035
- Uhh,
custom strongly dictates that...

263
00:11:44,037 --> 00:11:45,870
- yeah, I don't care.

264
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,173
Look, I know the books
almost as well as Quentin does.

265
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:49,808
I'm bored.

266
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,476
Let me be a little useful, okay?

267
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:52,711
- Fine.

268
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:53,945
But I do the talking.

269
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:56,247
You just stand there
and look vaguely indignant

270
00:11:56,249 --> 00:11:57,782
or whatever.

271
00:11:57,784 --> 00:11:59,250
Let's go.

272
00:12:11,832 --> 00:12:13,932
- It wasn't enough.

273
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:16,234
I need more time.

274
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,502
- To do what?

275
00:12:17,504 --> 00:12:20,505
- None of your business.

276
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:22,907
Relax, it's nothing.

277
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:30,749
What?

278
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:31,950
I like to read.
Is that a crime?

279
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:33,752
You can't be serious.

280
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:36,354
- I have the right to know
what I've been doing.

281
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:38,256
Illuminated manuscripts.

282
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,291
I remember this
from art history.

283
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:42,460
- Yeah.
- A-plus for you.

284
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,529
I was just bored.

285
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:47,198
- The monks got tired
of writing the same thing

286
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,902
over and over again so they...

287
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:52,971
They embellished in the margins.

288
00:12:52,973 --> 00:12:55,440
- Well, a lot of priests
dabbled in magic.

289
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,875
Some exploded.

290
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:02,547
Yeah.

291
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:04,382
Those monks were drama queens.

292
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:06,885
- Okay.
- "There must be another way

293
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:11,289
to bring back our brother"?

294
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,259
Are you looking
for a way to reverse it?

295
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:17,362
- No.
- No, Q, I'm not.

296
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:19,197
- Then why are you reading about
all these holy men

297
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:20,265
trying to fix niffins?

298
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:21,900
- What does it matter, Q?

299
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:23,234
They always fail.

300
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:24,569
Alice.

301
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:30,875
- Oh, my god.

302
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:37,582
- Welcome back, penny.

303
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:38,917
- I need a book.

304
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,451
"Future movements in magic."

305
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:43,555
- All right.
- Follow me.

306
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:45,456
Don't they have a copy
at Brakebills?

307
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,025
- It got destroyed.

308
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:51,296
I figure you guys
have every book here, so.

309
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:52,864
- Unfortunately,
you won't be able

310
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:54,199
to take this off the premises

311
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:56,201
since you don't
have a library card.

312
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:58,436
- Oh, no-no, I got one, um.

313
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,238
I'm just the errand boy.

314
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,507
- Mayakovsky.

315
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,042
I'm surprised
the two of you get along.

316
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:06,945
- No, we don't.
- Believe me.

317
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:08,947
My hands won't cast.

318
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:10,615
He's the only one
that can help me,

319
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:12,951
if I finish fetching
his goddamn grocery list

320
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:14,619
so we can get started, so.

321
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:16,020
- Ah.

322
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,322
I can put a rush on this book.

323
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:18,890
- Thank you.

324
00:14:18,892 --> 00:14:20,892
- If you're sure
that's what you really want.

325
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:22,493
- Well, I really want magic,
so, yeah.

326
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:24,963
- But to pay for it with
servitude to a lying drunkard...

327
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:26,631
- what's the alternative?

328
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:28,299
- Us.

329
00:14:28,301 --> 00:14:30,068
- You?

330
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,070
Librarians?

331
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:33,605
- The order of the library
of the Neitherlands

332
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:35,506
are master magicians.

333
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:37,508
We can help you, penny.

334
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,911
- 'Kay.

335
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:42,447
What's the catch?

336
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:44,382
- This contract
initiates our services

337
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:45,516
in exchange for...

338
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:48,386
- unlimited manual
and magical labor?

339
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:50,054
Bound in service to the library

340
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,990
up to and after my death,
are you kidding?

341
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:53,458
- All very standard.

342
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,493
- For a period of no less
than one million years?

343
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:57,395
Okay, lady, are you joking?

344
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:58,963
No.

345
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,432
- Okay.

346
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,336
- Okay, here's what Julia found.

347
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:07,405
August 20, 1976.

348
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:10,508
Baby surrendered at hospital.

349
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,577
Uh, a nurse, Michelle Walker

350
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:16,281
transferred it to
a state social worker, uh.

351
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:18,449
And after that

352
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:20,418
nothing, there's
no record of adoption or...

353
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,953
- Okay, so,

354
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:23,521
where's Michelle Walker now?

355
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,559
- Merciful sisters cemetery.

356
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:30,662
- Oh, shit.

357
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:32,363
Shit.

358
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:36,434
- Shit what?

359
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,304
- Just... dead ended again.

360
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:40,605
How's Mayakovsky?

361
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:42,407
- Oh, still a jerk-off,
you know.

362
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:47,145
What's wrong with you?

363
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:48,513
- Hm?

364
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:50,982
- Your mind is

365
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:54,552
- doing something.
- Uh, no, it's not.

366
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:57,055
- He's talking about me, Q.

367
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:58,690
- Stop that.
- Stop what?

368
00:15:58,692 --> 00:16:01,125
- Stop singing imagine dragons
to get me off the track.

369
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,061
- Lock it up, Q.
- Seriously.

370
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:04,963
- Look, why are you always
poking around in me anyway?

371
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:05,964
Can you just leave me alone?

372
00:16:05,966 --> 00:16:07,031
- Oh, I'd love to.

373
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:08,066
You leak, asshole.

374
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:11,135
- Okay.
- I have got to, uh...

375
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:16,174
- The hell was that?

376
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:19,477
- Something's wronger
than usual.

377
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,746
And he's a grown man.

378
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:23,581
Moving on.

379
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,149
Have you eaten lately?

380
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,051
You should eat.

381
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:32,557
- Penny, we still haven't...

382
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,025
You know,

383
00:16:34,027 --> 00:16:36,027
talked.

384
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,630
- Uh, I thought
we weren't gonna.

385
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:42,567
- Yeah, well, that was
when this was some quick fun,

386
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:45,069
not hanging out 24/7

387
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:47,572
fucking our brains out,
robbing banks.

388
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:49,640
- That is fun.

389
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:50,642
- It's all I need.

390
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:53,144
- Okay, here's the deal.

391
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:55,113
I can't exactly study magic

392
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:56,714
unless I sign an insane contract

393
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:59,517
or Mayakovsky stops
dicking around.

394
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,686
What I can do
is help stop the evil freak

395
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:03,755
that tried to rip your heart
out of your chest.

396
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:06,491
I'll sleep better with him dead.
Simple.

397
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:08,092
You want to
keep things professional?

398
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:09,427
Fine.

399
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:10,595
It's no big deal.

400
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:15,400
- good.

401
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,517
- Greetings!

402
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:36,754
I am Margo,
high queen of Fillory.

403
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:41,559
<i>Habla ingles</i> or what?

404
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,200
Hi.

405
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:51,102
So you the nymph?

406
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:52,503
- Dryad.

407
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:54,338
I thought you were all girls.

408
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,341
- Listen, I know your
tree buddies don't like us.

409
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:59,243
- The rulers of Fillory
have a long and tragic

410
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,645
history of arboreal disrespect.

411
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:02,246
- Yeah, okay.

412
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:03,548
Look, it's a new day.

413
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,716
We're a kinder, gentler Fillory.

414
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:08,686
So we need to settle some unrest
with our lorian neighbors.

415
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:11,155
- Settle unrest.

416
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:12,356
You mean wage war.

417
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:13,724
- No, we mean

418
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:15,393
button some messy shit up.

419
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:17,228
- Help us here.

420
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,596
We want to make this work.

421
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:19,597
Respectfully.

422
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,399
- That's rich.

423
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:23,301
Considering your king
apparently wouldn't deign

424
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:25,303
to come here himself,

425
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:28,372
sending two females.

426
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:32,577
- Hey, this is Julia.

427
00:18:32,579 --> 00:18:35,613
Royal ambassador.

428
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,516
And I am Fillory's
one and only high queen.

429
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:40,551
- Yes.
- The insult's been noted.

430
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:42,453
Passage is denied.

431
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,488
Good day.

432
00:18:46,493 --> 00:18:49,794
- Damn it.

433
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,162
Let's go.

434
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,644
- Before you ask, no.

435
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:08,479
No luck with
the adoption records.

436
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:12,316
No luck with the hospital.
And no luck with the nurse.

437
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,384
- What's wrong with you?

438
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:15,453
Your wards are airtight.

439
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:16,787
- You complained,
so I fixed them.

440
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:18,756
- Since when are you
that good at fixing anything?

441
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,591
- Can we agree that I lose
no matter what I say,

442
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:21,592
and just stop talking?

443
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:24,328
So Reynard's kid.

444
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,530
- Yeah, so,

445
00:19:25,532 --> 00:19:26,797
the trail stops
when the nurse dies.

446
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,633
- Shit.

447
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:31,536
- If only there was a way
to literally see into the past.

448
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:33,204
- You know, I think
I just remembered

449
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:34,539
there might be a way.

450
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,574
- Yeah, time bridge.
- We thought of that.

451
00:19:36,576 --> 00:19:37,708
There's nothing close enough.

452
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,210
- No, uh,

453
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:41,279
time sight, literally.

454
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:42,613
- We never studied that.

455
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:45,550
- Uh, no, but I think Alice did.

456
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:47,552
- Hmm, uh, can't remember.

457
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:48,786
- Did she or didn't she?

458
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:50,288
- She did, uh.

459
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,722
I think it was

460
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:54,525
uh, uh, extra reading

461
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,494
in metageology?

462
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:57,695
- Nope.
- Nope.

463
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:00,264
Um, oh, I think,
or, it was an elective

464
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:02,466
in, uh, basics in
Vedic prognostication.

465
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:04,569
- Nope.
- Nope. Um.

466
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:06,571
- Give me an extra hour tonight
and I'll tell you.

467
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:07,805
Hm.

468
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,674
- Was it, uh,
something we learned

469
00:20:09,676 --> 00:20:11,375
in Sunderland's class, I mean,
'cause we never studied...

470
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,344
- are you, like,

471
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:15,646
having an add moment
right now, or?

472
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:17,682
- No... it... um...

473
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:18,816
Okay, so here's the thing.

474
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:20,518
Um, there's this one time,

475
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,819
Alice and I, right?

476
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:23,321
We were studying;

477
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:25,756
we were sharing lab materials.

478
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:26,824
And people didn't
know this about Alice,

479
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:29,393
but she was really greedy

480
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,295
with her lab materials.

481
00:20:31,297 --> 00:20:32,663
Um, and

482
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:35,566
so she would offer to help me
for extra time with them...

483
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,535
- none of this
is interesting to any of us.

484
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:38,569
- The point is

485
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:41,772
I would say 20 extra minutes,

486
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:43,674
one time offer,

487
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:44,742
take it or leave it.

488
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:45,843
- 30.

489
00:20:45,845 --> 00:20:48,813
- Fine. Deal.

490
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:50,414
Is how that would go.

491
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,416
In a nutshell.

492
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,718
- Phosphoromancy.

493
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,553
My discipline, idiot.

494
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:58,422
Mckellan's got a scope that
can bend light into the past.

495
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:01,425
- Phosphoromancy.

496
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:02,893
Ugh.
I'm an idiot.

497
00:21:02,895 --> 00:21:03,894
- Correct.

498
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:06,364
- Shut up, I... remembered.

499
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:07,898
Uh, okay, so

500
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,768
the viewing device, it's
in professor Mckellan's office.

501
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,770
Ooh, penny.

502
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:15,439
- See, even he can't wait
to get away from you.

503
00:21:17,909 --> 00:21:20,478
- Is this thing gonna work
or not?

504
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,647
Eliot has shit to do.

505
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:25,383
- He has to do the work
of crossing back.

506
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:27,551
Not everyone chooses to do so.

507
00:21:27,553 --> 00:21:30,721
- Okay.
- Can you step out for a minute?

508
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:32,790
Fen, you too, sweetie.

509
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,367
Eliot,

510
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:46,871
you need to come back.

511
00:21:46,873 --> 00:21:50,408
I know that you have
a constant low-key death wish,

512
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:53,844
but you can't leave.

513
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:55,813
They don't want me.

514
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:58,916
They want the high king.

515
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:12,596
I'm faking it, El.

516
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:18,869
So if you could just

517
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:21,672
please,

518
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,709
please, wake up.

519
00:22:36,723 --> 00:22:39,690
- I set it to August 20, 1976.

520
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,663
- Holy shit.

521
00:22:47,934 --> 00:22:49,400
- What, what do you see?

522
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:50,668
- Uh, just

523
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,403
people waiting.

524
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:02,446
Oh, here we go.

525
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:03,848
- What?

526
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:06,884
- A nurse with a baby.

527
00:23:15,995 --> 00:23:17,828
Uh.

528
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:20,765
What?

529
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:24,735
You got to be kidding me.

530
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,504
- What?

531
00:23:26,506 --> 00:23:27,538
What's wrong?

532
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:34,779
Ah, shit.

533
00:23:34,781 --> 00:23:36,480
Dana did this.

534
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:37,948
To protect the baby's identity,

535
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,918
even from spells
40 years in the future.

536
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:45,456
She thought of everything.

537
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,658
And back to square nothing.

538
00:24:14,187 --> 00:24:15,519
- Hi.

539
00:24:15,521 --> 00:24:16,954
I'm Julia.

540
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:18,589
God, been waiting hours

541
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:20,491
for you to get
close enough to grab.

542
00:24:20,493 --> 00:24:22,026
I think my foot fell asleep.

543
00:24:22,028 --> 00:24:23,928
- I will never help Fillory.

544
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,029
I'd sooner be skinned.

545
00:24:25,031 --> 00:24:26,997
- All right, boys, let him go.

546
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:29,166
Give us some air,
but stay close-ish.

547
00:24:31,904 --> 00:24:33,237
Hate Fillory all you want.

548
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:34,638
I'm here for one thing,

549
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,507
and then I'm off this planet.

550
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:38,175
An invisibility spell

551
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:41,479
strong enough
to hide from a god.

552
00:24:41,481 --> 00:24:42,746
- And why should I
give it to you?

553
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:45,115
- Because I may not
give a shit about Fillory.

554
00:24:45,117 --> 00:24:47,551
But I do,
as its royal ambassador,

555
00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:50,621
have access to
its guards and its dungeons.

556
00:24:50,623 --> 00:24:53,591
And I'll use a
to throw you in b,

557
00:24:53,593 --> 00:24:55,993
but help me,
and I'll let you go free.

558
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:57,161
- I don't believe you.

559
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:58,629
Your loyalty will always
lie with...

560
00:24:58,631 --> 00:24:59,763
- with me.

561
00:24:59,765 --> 00:25:01,966
My loyalty will
always lie with me.

562
00:25:28,793 --> 00:25:31,228
Drill a hole in it.
Wear it.

563
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,563
No god can sense you.

564
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:35,199
- Thank you.

565
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:37,201
You're free to go.

566
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,045
Hey, dryad boy!

567
00:25:49,315 --> 00:25:52,316
Come on out.
I saw you in there, sweetheart.

568
00:25:56,187 --> 00:25:58,722
- Negotiations are over.

569
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:00,324
Go home.

570
00:26:00,326 --> 00:26:03,060
- I brought you something.

571
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:07,598
A small token of peace.

572
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,999
- It won't change anything.

573
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:11,135
- Just give it to your bosses.

574
00:26:11,137 --> 00:26:13,337
I'm trying to fix this.

575
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:24,615
Thank you.

576
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,825
- I've been looking for you.

577
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:14,098
You've lived here since
the bush administration,

578
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,866
but you're
thousands of years old.

579
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:22,206
You're an anglerbeast.

580
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:23,807
- That's stupid.

581
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,876
You play too much
dungeons and dragons.

582
00:27:28,381 --> 00:27:31,749
- You knew a man,
a long time ago.

583
00:27:31,751 --> 00:27:33,884
He was special and
he lived in a monastery,

584
00:27:33,886 --> 00:27:36,086
a master magician.

585
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:38,389
Friar Joseph.

586
00:27:38,391 --> 00:27:39,823
Ring a bell?

587
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:46,130
I want to know
everything about him.

588
00:27:46,132 --> 00:27:49,700
- Well, in the parlance
of your time,

589
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:52,870
fuck you, pay me.

590
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,774
Fresh meat.

591
00:27:56,776 --> 00:27:59,877
Newborns are the sweetest.

592
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,715
- You know, I thought
about doing that,

593
00:28:04,717 --> 00:28:06,950
but my time is very limited.

594
00:28:06,952 --> 00:28:10,888
So I researched
your weak spots instead.

595
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,923
- And you believe what you read?

596
00:28:22,768 --> 00:28:25,469
That was stupid of you.

597
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:39,983
Oh, my god.

598
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:44,388
Alice, what did you do?

599
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:45,989
- Relax.

600
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:49,293
Can't hurt anybody, remember?

601
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:50,327
- But she's...

602
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:52,296
- a monster.

603
00:28:52,298 --> 00:28:53,897
Technically, I did good here.

604
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:56,867
I mean, there's a ton of
kid bones in this sandbox.

605
00:28:56,869 --> 00:29:01,004
It wasn't cooperating
so I had to use

606
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:03,841
enhanced
interrogation techniques.

607
00:29:03,843 --> 00:29:05,442
- To find out what?

608
00:29:05,444 --> 00:29:08,812
- We might want to go before
the rest of it lumbers up here.

609
00:29:08,814 --> 00:29:10,514
It's pretty mad at me.

610
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,187
- What the hell
were you thinking, huh?

611
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:18,889
You burned down
the one-way-forest

612
00:29:18,891 --> 00:29:22,292
while I'm trying to
wiggle us out of full-on war?

613
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:24,428
Those trees were dicks.

614
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,263
- They were endangered.

615
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:28,465
Now trees all over Fillory
are enraged

616
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:29,867
and calling for action.

617
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:32,402
Do you have any idea
what you did, Julia?

618
00:29:32,404 --> 00:29:33,937
- Yeah.

619
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:35,472
I helped you.

620
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:37,007
Now you can cross into Loria

621
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:39,042
and kick their fucking asses
like you wanted to.

622
00:29:39,044 --> 00:29:41,879
- This is not how
I wanted to go about that.

623
00:29:41,881 --> 00:29:43,814
- Yeah, I know.

624
00:29:43,816 --> 00:29:45,349
So the really good news is

625
00:29:45,351 --> 00:29:47,417
you didn't do anything.

626
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:49,286
Go back and tell
the angry tree lobby

627
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:51,488
it was all crazy Julia.

628
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:52,856
You're welcome.

629
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:54,391
Look, I got what I wanted.

630
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:55,959
The rest was all a favor to you.

631
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,828
So banish me forever.

632
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:00,030
Send me home.

633
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:02,432
- You know, in a sick way,

634
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:04,434
I sort of admire you.

635
00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:06,837
That being said,
here's what we do

636
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:09,339
to loose cannons
in Fillory, ready?

637
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:12,376
Guards!

638
00:30:12,378 --> 00:30:15,379
Take this bitch to the dungeon.

639
00:30:15,381 --> 00:30:16,413
You gotta be kidding me.

640
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:18,849
- Now, if you'll excuse me,

641
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:20,584
I have some
damage control to do.

642
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,558
- How to break a word as bond.

643
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:33,497
Reversing a word as bond.

644
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:35,432
Amending a word as bond.

645
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:37,401
- It's not there.

646
00:30:37,403 --> 00:30:40,404
That's the whole point.
You can't break it.

647
00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:42,105
Why don't you
do something useful

648
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:46,276
and catch up on all the classes
you missed in Fillory?

649
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:47,477
- This isn't working.

650
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:48,912
- Yeah, tell me about it.

651
00:30:48,914 --> 00:30:50,447
- Keeping you a secret
and trying to help you

652
00:30:50,449 --> 00:30:53,517
while you do god knows what.

653
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,919
I have to ask for help.
I need to tell someone.

654
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:57,321
- Great idea.

655
00:30:57,323 --> 00:30:59,456
You think you know
locked up for crazy?

656
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:01,058
They'll put you someplace
you can't even imagine.

657
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,960
And they'll box me up so
quick...

658
00:31:02,962 --> 00:31:04,561
All your efforts for nothing.
Is that what you want?

659
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:06,563
- I want Alice back.
- I want the real you.

660
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:09,299
I want... I...

661
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:11,034
I can't help Fillory.

662
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:12,436
And I can't help Eliot.

663
00:31:12,438 --> 00:31:13,904
And I can't help Julia.

664
00:31:13,906 --> 00:31:16,340
And I just want to do...

665
00:31:16,342 --> 00:31:18,442
God, one thing for the person
that deserves it the most.

666
00:31:18,444 --> 00:31:21,879
That's what I want.

667
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:23,013
God.

668
00:31:26,018 --> 00:31:27,584
- I understand.

669
00:31:30,155 --> 00:31:33,390
Do you want to know the truth?

670
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:35,359
You are a failure.

671
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:38,896
So stop using me
to try to fix that.

672
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:40,497
Uh-oh, look at the time.

673
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:41,498
- Uh... wait... no.

674
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,599
- Word as bond, kid.

675
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:44,001
My turn.

676
00:31:52,378 --> 00:31:54,411
- What are we drinking to?

677
00:31:55,915 --> 00:31:57,547
- Dead ends.

678
00:32:02,488 --> 00:32:03,587
- What?

679
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:05,222
- I'm adjusting.

680
00:32:05,224 --> 00:32:06,623
You used to
hold your liquor better.

681
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:08,625
- Yeah, well,
I used to drink for fun.

682
00:32:10,663 --> 00:32:12,629
Now I drink to get too fucked up

683
00:32:12,631 --> 00:32:16,166
to go out and do anything worse.

684
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:19,169
God, I hope
this works as a mixer.

685
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:24,408
- Oh...

686
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:27,511
Did I forget to mention
that I have to take this now?

687
00:32:27,513 --> 00:32:29,146
'Cause I'm a junkie.

688
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:30,681
Ah.

689
00:32:30,683 --> 00:32:33,150
Just trying to
stay straight long enough

690
00:32:33,152 --> 00:32:36,520
to find Reynard without
falling the fuck apart.

691
00:32:36,522 --> 00:32:37,688
- Kady, we're...

692
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:41,124
We're gonna find the son.

693
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:42,693
You think?

694
00:32:42,695 --> 00:32:44,561
I think

695
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:45,662
you and me,

696
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:48,265
put our minds together?

697
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:49,466
Shit gets done.

698
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:51,668
- Oh, god.

699
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:54,671
That is so stupid it's sad.

700
00:32:54,673 --> 00:32:56,974
And I don't think
you were listening

701
00:32:56,976 --> 00:32:58,642
when I said I'm not
your fucking girlfriend...

702
00:32:58,644 --> 00:33:00,410
- good.
- I don't want one.

703
00:33:00,412 --> 00:33:02,179
- Oh, yeah.

704
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:03,313
Yeah, I get it.

705
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:06,583
Yeah, you're very tough, right?

706
00:33:06,585 --> 00:33:09,453
Oh, god... yeah, you're real cool.

707
00:33:09,455 --> 00:33:12,389
You're not hearing me.

708
00:33:12,391 --> 00:33:14,558
I am not your problem.

709
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,526
This isn't your chance to prove

710
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:19,730
that you're some kind of hero.

711
00:33:19,732 --> 00:33:24,301
You want your dick sucked?
Great, I can do that.

712
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:28,472
Then I'd love it
if you'd fuck off.

713
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:58,268
<i>- BBC world news...</i>

714
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,803
- I had him stop
for fish and chips.

715
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:01,605
Best shop in Dublin, he said.

716
00:34:01,607 --> 00:34:03,040
- Are you kidding me?

717
00:34:04,777 --> 00:34:06,743
Wait, uh, no, no, just, uh,

718
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:10,280
just wait here for a second.

719
00:34:10,282 --> 00:34:12,349
You portaled us to Ireland?

720
00:34:13,352 --> 00:34:14,451
To do what?

721
00:34:14,453 --> 00:34:15,752
- Where are we going?
- Home.

722
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:17,354
It's done.
We already did it.

723
00:34:17,356 --> 00:34:20,424
- Did what?

724
00:34:20,426 --> 00:34:23,827
Alice, what did you do?

725
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:25,362
Uh,

726
00:34:25,364 --> 00:34:28,065
oh, uh, sir,
where did we just come from?

727
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:29,499
- About three streets that way.

728
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:31,768
- Great.
- Can we go back there now?

729
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33,670
- Right.

730
00:34:33,672 --> 00:34:36,773
- Wait, Quentin, no.
- I'm serious, don't.

731
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:38,742
Q, stop.
Hold on.

732
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:41,812
Q, please, wait.

733
00:34:41,814 --> 00:34:43,747
Please, Quentin, don't.

734
00:34:59,098 --> 00:35:00,530
- You...

735
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:02,732
- Tricked you
with reverse psychology?

736
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:04,401
It was shockingly easy.

737
00:35:04,403 --> 00:35:06,269
"No, don't go.
Please."

738
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:08,305
- Alice, what did you do?
- Nothing.

739
00:35:08,307 --> 00:35:10,841
I can't do magic, remember?
I'm stuck inside you.

740
00:35:10,843 --> 00:35:12,676
So you did it.

741
00:35:14,413 --> 00:35:16,446
I believe you called to me

742
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:18,548
with something personal,

743
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:22,752
at the place of
my transformation.

744
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,489
The music you got wrong.

745
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:27,124
Ponderous.

746
00:35:27,126 --> 00:35:28,892
Ah, but the birds.

747
00:35:28,894 --> 00:35:30,694
I did love those.

748
00:35:30,696 --> 00:35:32,129
All my life,

749
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:35,799
I thought them god's
most perfect

750
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:37,334
works of art.

751
00:35:37,336 --> 00:35:38,635
Just look at them.

752
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:43,473
Bit annoying, though.

753
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:45,609
All that cooing.

754
00:35:45,611 --> 00:35:47,444
Now,

755
00:35:47,446 --> 00:35:49,913
why did you summon me?

756
00:35:49,915 --> 00:35:51,848
Or didn't you mean to do that?

757
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,517
Maybe it was you.

758
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:55,852
- You can see me.

759
00:35:55,854 --> 00:35:57,587
- Of course I can.

760
00:35:57,589 --> 00:36:00,557
What on earth are you doing
inside this boy?

761
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:02,859
- Friar Joseph, I...
- I've been searching for you.

762
00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:05,629
I need your help.
With him.

763
00:36:05,631 --> 00:36:09,799
- This crushable
little field mouse?

764
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:12,435
<i>- Seni Baglamak.</i>
- I bind you.

765
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:14,471
<i>Seni Baglamak.</i>
I bind you!

766
00:36:16,575 --> 00:36:17,941
Silly boy.

767
00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:21,678
I can't be boxed.

768
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:26,550
- I read about you.

769
00:36:26,552 --> 00:36:28,652
Priests studying magic
till they've gone too far

770
00:36:28,654 --> 00:36:30,554
that their brothers
have to box them.

771
00:36:30,556 --> 00:36:32,589
Except sometimes
the boxing doesn't go right.

772
00:36:32,591 --> 00:36:36,359
- Yes, the occasional
niffin did slip through.

773
00:36:36,361 --> 00:36:37,561
- That's what I thought.

774
00:36:37,563 --> 00:36:39,696
Until I figured out that

775
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:42,432
it wasn't a handful
who escaped, it was just you.

776
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:45,235
You slipped away
over and over again

777
00:36:45,237 --> 00:36:47,571
because you figured out
how to do it.

778
00:36:47,573 --> 00:36:50,240
You can't be boxed.

779
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:51,775
I need you to teach me.

780
00:36:51,777 --> 00:36:53,443
- Al...
- Will you make him shut up?

781
00:36:53,445 --> 00:36:55,478
- I can do anything in here.
- No, I won't...

782
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:01,284
- I'll do anything.

783
00:37:01,286 --> 00:37:02,652
I'm serious.

784
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:10,627
- Shit.

785
00:37:10,629 --> 00:37:11,861
Let him go, if he passes out

786
00:37:11,863 --> 00:37:13,763
I won't be able
to talk to you anymore.

787
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:20,237
- Please show me how you do it.

788
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:23,340
- I've been like this
for six centuries.

789
00:37:23,342 --> 00:37:24,874
The things that I know now

790
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:26,676
you cannot imagine.

791
00:37:26,678 --> 00:37:28,245
- That's what I want.

792
00:37:29,481 --> 00:37:30,747
Please, can I go with you?

793
00:37:30,749 --> 00:37:32,782
- You?
- With me?

794
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,256
You can't even get out of
this shoddy little magician.

795
00:37:39,258 --> 00:37:42,359
How smart, how able
could you be?

796
00:37:42,361 --> 00:37:46,663
How could you help me
with anything worthwhile?

797
00:37:46,665 --> 00:37:48,531
- Listen to me,
it's not that simple.

798
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:50,500
- But it is.

799
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:52,435
Free yourself.

800
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,271
- But I can't.
- The... the trap is...

801
00:37:54,273 --> 00:37:55,905
- find a way.

802
00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:57,741
Then find me.

803
00:37:57,743 --> 00:38:00,543
Then I will show you
a secret or two.

804
00:38:00,545 --> 00:38:02,512
Because then you'll have proven

805
00:38:02,514 --> 00:38:03,613
that you deserve to know them.

806
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:04,614
- Please.

807
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:05,815
- Thanks for the birds.

808
00:38:07,552 --> 00:38:09,786
- Alice...
- No-no-no-no-no-no-no!

809
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:10,820
- Alice, we can
talk about this...

810
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:12,355
- just shut up!
- Shut up!

811
00:38:12,357 --> 00:38:14,357
Shut up!

812
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:15,825
The sound of your voice,

813
00:38:15,827 --> 00:38:18,328
your breath, your body,
your mind, your weakness,

814
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:19,329
I can't stand it.

815
00:38:19,331 --> 00:38:20,497
- Stop it.

816
00:38:26,571 --> 00:38:28,438
Did you do that on purpose?

817
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,440
- No.

818
00:38:30,442 --> 00:38:31,574
- Then wha...

819
00:38:31,576 --> 00:38:33,310
- You know what this is.

820
00:38:33,312 --> 00:38:36,346
This is your body trying
to hold a niffin inside it.

821
00:38:36,348 --> 00:38:37,447
You can't.

822
00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:38,948
Not for much longer.

823
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,817
Or it's gonna kill us both.

824
00:39:20,925 --> 00:39:23,493
- Well?
- Did it work?

825
00:39:23,495 --> 00:39:24,661
- No. But...

826
00:39:24,663 --> 00:39:26,463
- well, then, get out.

827
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:30,900
Okay, look.

828
00:39:30,902 --> 00:39:32,001
It's gonna be okay.

829
00:39:32,003 --> 00:39:34,437
- I'm pregnant.

830
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:36,906
We're about to go into war.
We need the king.

831
00:39:36,908 --> 00:39:39,676
I need my husband.

832
00:39:39,678 --> 00:39:41,745
- Well, you got me.

833
00:39:41,747 --> 00:39:44,848
I'm gonna take care of you
and the kid.

834
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:48,017
I will untangle
this war shit somehow.

835
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:50,653
I know the high king
has the power,

836
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:54,524
but I will hunt ember
to the ends of the world

837
00:39:54,526 --> 00:39:57,861
to have that
stupid rule rewritten.

838
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:02,632
Everything El promised,

839
00:40:02,634 --> 00:40:04,534
I'm gonna deliver.

840
00:40:04,536 --> 00:40:05,702
You hear me?

841
00:40:05,704 --> 00:40:07,604
- Yes.

842
00:40:07,606 --> 00:40:09,672
- Listen to high king Bambi.

843
00:40:10,675 --> 00:40:12,709
- You're alive.

844
00:40:14,813 --> 00:40:17,580
- Nice of you
to join us, asshole.

845
00:40:19,951 --> 00:40:22,852
- Really does sound like
you got it all handled.

846
00:40:22,854 --> 00:40:24,554
- I do.

847
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:27,690
But it's more fun with you.

848
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:32,662
- From "the book of
Dana Wallens."

849
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:38,668
- "His adoptive mother
christened him

850
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,770
John Spencer Gaines."

851
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:42,539
Oh, my god.

852
00:40:42,541 --> 00:40:43,673
You found his name.

853
00:40:43,675 --> 00:40:45,074
- Stole, technically.

854
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:48,545
But I think the librarian
might let it slide

855
00:40:48,547 --> 00:40:50,847
since now I'm an employee.

856
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:52,782
- Wait... you...

857
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,751
You signed that insane contract?

858
00:40:54,753 --> 00:40:55,752
- Yeah, it's okay.

859
00:40:55,754 --> 00:40:57,620
- How the hell is that okay?

860
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,923
- Because I get magic back.

861
00:40:59,925 --> 00:41:03,493
Least the order's upfront
about what shit costs.

862
00:41:03,495 --> 00:41:05,728
Plus, the way I see it,
I should already be dead by now.

863
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,697
You know?
So this is all bonus.

864
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:10,867
Who gives a shit
about all that future.

865
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:13,002
- Did you do this for me?

866
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:15,738
- Well, not just, but...

867
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,674
Yeah.
You know, yeah, I did.

868
00:41:17,676 --> 00:41:19,642
- Were you not listening
to a word I said?

869
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:20,844
- Yeah, I was listening.

870
00:41:20,846 --> 00:41:22,011
But guess what,
it's not up to you

871
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:24,781
to decide if
you're worth my time.

872
00:41:24,783 --> 00:41:27,684
I get to do whatever the fuck
I want with it,

873
00:41:27,686 --> 00:41:28,885
even if it is spend it on a girl

874
00:41:28,887 --> 00:41:30,920
that threatens to bail
all the goddamn time.

875
00:41:30,922 --> 00:41:32,856
'Cause guess what, Kady?

876
00:41:32,858 --> 00:41:35,725
I didn't think I was ever
gonna fucking see you again.

877
00:41:35,727 --> 00:41:37,560
And that puts shit
into perspective.

878
00:41:39,764 --> 00:41:41,698
I love you.

879
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,700
Okay?
Deal.

880
00:41:46,771 --> 00:41:47,904
- Shit.

881
00:41:54,646 --> 00:41:56,880
- Okay, enough.

882
00:41:56,882 --> 00:41:58,748
What the fuck?

883
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,550
- Can we do this another time?
- No.

884
00:42:00,552 --> 00:42:01,885
First your mind was weird,

885
00:42:01,887 --> 00:42:05,054
then it got locked up,
and now you're bleeding.

886
00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:06,656
Are you high?
Are you possessed?

887
00:42:06,658 --> 00:42:08,658
- What's...
- why do you care?

888
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,126
- Because

889
00:42:10,128 --> 00:42:11,928
like it or not,

890
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:13,763
we're the closest thing
you have to friends.

891
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:20,637
Yeah, glass jaw.
Not a surprise.

892
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:23,139
Don't look at me.
Incept him.

893
00:42:23,141 --> 00:42:26,609
- I'll give it to you,
you're practical.

894
00:42:32,918 --> 00:42:34,584
- Get out of here!
- Right now!

895
00:42:37,122 --> 00:42:38,655
- Alice is in there!

896
00:42:38,657 --> 00:42:39,923
- What?
- I don't understand.

897
00:42:39,925 --> 00:42:41,057
- Neither do I,
but she's in there

898
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,692
and she just tried to kill me!

899
00:42:42,694 --> 00:42:44,694
- Okay, well,
what the hell should we do?
