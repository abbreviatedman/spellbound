still out there?

the knife

Before he does,

in the armory reading.

Uh, and, uh, you know,
like, whatever he finds,

it doesn't say,

215
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:29,527

is to petition ember and umber

00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:18,863
- You know what?
- We're kinda in a hurry.

354
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:21,132
- I understand.
- As you wish.

355
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:23,201
Pleasure to serve.

356
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:26,571
- I think he wants a tip.

357
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:28,573
- 20 gold pieces is customary.

358
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:30,308
- Okay, that sounds like a lot.

359
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,742
- Well, this is
Chatwin's torrent.

360
00:18:31,744 --> 00:18:33,744
- We don't have...
- There was nothing

361
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:35,513
about charging in the books.

362
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:37,849
- Oh, uh, you'd rather pay
in labor?

363
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:39,383
I think three to five years.

364
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:41,486
- Are you fucking kidding me?

365
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:43,754
You said none of this
before I went in the river.

366
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:45,389
- Because I have manners...

367
00:18:45,391 --> 00:18:47,892
- are you even officially
affiliated with the torrent?

368
00:18:47,894 --> 00:18:49,160
- Penny, chill out.

369
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:50,561
- It's kind of
an amateur calling.

370
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,563
- Oh, I see.
- Yes, yes, you're a con man.

371
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:55,533
- No, penny...
- No, I know his type.

372
00:18:55,535 --> 00:18:57,502
I've been ripped off
plenty of times

373
00:18:57,504 --> 00:19:01,239
by smiling little snake oil
pricks like this dude.

374
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:02,707
- Okay, all right.
- Same in Detroit,

375
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:05,610
same in Mumbai, same in Fillory.

376
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:07,778
Sorry, try it on the next sap

377
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:12,416
who needs this natural resource
on public property.

378
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:14,185
Good luck.

379
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:17,054
- I'm sorry.
- He gets touchy.

380
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:19,223
It's... it's not personal.

381
00:19:19,225 --> 00:19:22,460
Um, these are diamond.

382
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:25,796
- What the hell is diamond?
- Here.

383
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:28,299
- When you meet one scammer,
you met 'em all. Let's go.

384
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:30,368
- Okay.

386
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,517
- Okay, so this net...
- This net you throw,

387
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,985
what sort of a net
catches a god?

388
00:19:47,987 --> 00:19:49,387
- Oh, it's an obscure bit
of casting,

389
00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:51,055
but I assure you it works.

390
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:53,858
We'll just have to act fast
when the time comes.

391
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,160
It'll hold for a few seconds.

392
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:59,263
So...

393
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:01,332
I need a few items.

394
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:09,006
- Okay, it might be better for
me to go alone for some of this.

395
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:11,409
- Uh, can you drop me
at the playground?

396
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:13,444
I like to watch
the little children play.

397
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:16,047
It's perfectly innocent.

Let's do this.

401

I call high queen.

402
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:40,404
- [Chuckles]
- Did it work?

403
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,807
- Perfect.
- Lead the way.

404
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,987
It's fine.
They're just healing.

I'm the high king of Fillory.

I took a blood test.

431
00:22:37,757 --> 00:22:42,560
- Excellent, excellent.
- It's an honor.

432
00:22:42,562 --> 00:22:44,695
- Can we have the crowns,
please?

433
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,997
- Certainly.
- Honored to oblige.

434
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:50,334
Just as soon
as you pass the test.

435
00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:52,570
- Of course there's a test.

436
00:22:52,572 --> 00:22:56,540
- As you know,
only a child of earth

437
00:22:56,542 --> 00:23:00,111
can wear the crown
of the high king.

438
00:23:00,113 --> 00:23:02,346
I will ask you
a series of questions

439
00:23:02,348 --> 00:23:05,015
designed to root out
all pretenders to the throne.

440
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:08,018
Only a true high king
will hold the answers

441
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,087
in his heart.

442
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:15,960
- Come at me.

443
00:23:15,962 --> 00:23:20,097
- What popular American
television program

444
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:23,067
stars actor Tim Daly?

445
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:24,602
- What the fuck?

446
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:26,537
- He was in a lot of TV shows.

447
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:28,305
- There is only one
correct answer.

448
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:30,141
- Okay.
- Give me the next question.

449
00:23:30,143 --> 00:23:34,545
- This hit single
is performed by offspring

450
00:23:34,547 --> 00:23:36,447
of famous entertainers.

451
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:39,150
- Dude, that is crazy vague.

452
00:23:39,152 --> 00:23:41,419
- You will receive
a single hint.

453
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:44,288
Your hint is beach boys.

454
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:47,591
Both: "Hold on"
by Wilson Phillips.

455
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,427
- That song is my jam.

456
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:52,263
- Wait, all these questions
are from the '90s.

457
00:23:52,265 --> 00:23:54,999
- It... it's not the 1990s
on earth right now?

458
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:56,967
- No, it... it's 2017.

459
00:23:56,969 --> 00:24:00,905
Oh, and it's, uh, "wings,"
the... the Tim Daly show. "Wings."

460
00:24:00,907 --> 00:24:05,142
- Of course you know that.
- Okay, '90s.

461
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:07,745
Ask me something
about Patrick Swayze.

462
00:24:07,747 --> 00:24:09,814
- You know of Swayze?

463
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:22,126
- Ahem.

The crowns of Fillory are yours.

put them on.

- No, god, stop.

480
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:24,255
I mean, I just...
We should do a-a ceremony.

481
00:25:24,257 --> 00:25:26,223
This is only gonna happen once.

482
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:28,259
We are becoming
kings and queens,

483
00:25:28,261 --> 00:25:33,864
so... It's important
and we should honor it.

484
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:38,369
Just give me that.

Would you just do it?
It's gonna be quick, I promise.

487
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,751
So, destiny is...
It's bullshit.

488
00:25:53,753 --> 00:25:56,720
But you are high king
in your blood.

489
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,822
And somehow that makes sense,
you know?

490
00:25:58,824 --> 00:26:00,925
And I-i just...
For what it's worth,

491
00:26:00,927 --> 00:26:04,662
I think that you are going to be
a really good king.

492
00:26:04,664 --> 00:26:09,466
Um, so, um,
I-i dub thee,

um, I don't know.

494
00:26:11,938 --> 00:26:14,171
Would you say, like,
you're more brave or merciful?

495
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:16,941
- I'd say I'm neither.

496
00:26:16,943 --> 00:26:20,311

a spectacular monarch.

501
00:26:35,795 --> 00:26:38,862

as underwear.

Thank you.

504
00:26:49,342 --> 00:26:52,509
I have no idea,

I do hereby crown you

507
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:00,951
the destroyer.

508
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,820
I mean that
in the best possible sense.

509
00:27:02,822 --> 00:27:07,191
Uh, all hail.
Everyone clap.

511
00:27:11,896 --> 00:27:15,399
I have known what you truly are

512
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:18,369
since the day we met.

513
00:27:18,371 --> 00:27:20,437
Long may you reign.

514
00:27:30,248 --> 00:27:32,883
I feel it's incumbent upon me

515
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:37,321
to promise never again
to betray you like I did.

516
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:42,059
I really...
Really am sorry.

517
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:46,497
I have some character defects.
I'm working on it.

518
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:48,565
Honestly.

519
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:58,242
- I'm working on some too.

520
00:27:58,244 --> 00:28:00,744

the wise.

523
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:18,595
- No, wait.

524
00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:21,665
Since we're cleaning slates
and shit, give me.

525
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:28,539
Q.

526
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:32,743
Uh, I could start
by saying something cruel

527
00:28:32,745 --> 00:28:35,479
yet totally hilarious about you.

528
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:40,050
Let's be real,
you're an easy target.

529
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:41,985
But that's...

530
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:45,422
Well, that's because you're
honest about what you love.

531
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:47,891
And underneath it all, that's...

532
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:50,294
Inspiring.

533
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:53,964
And I'm sorry too.

534
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:55,466
Not about the sex,

535
00:28:55,468 --> 00:28:58,469
I don't even really remember it.

536
00:28:58,471 --> 00:29:01,805
Mostly my part in fucking up
something that was good for you.

537
00:29:01,807 --> 00:29:05,309
- Thanks, I think
I fucked it up just fine myself.

538
00:29:05,311 --> 00:29:07,444
- Now that we're ruling
a kingdom together,

539
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:09,980
I hope we can be
whatever we were again.

540
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:12,616
- I guess you could
call that friends.

541
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:14,952
- Let's go with that.

542
00:29:14,954 --> 00:29:18,589
I hereby crown you king Quentin

543
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:23,827
the moderately
socially maladjusted.

544
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:26,897
- Scrunch down.
- Yeah.

545
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:35,906
[Applause]

546
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:40,110
Royalty, bitches.

547
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,524
- Okay.

548
00:29:58,897 --> 00:30:02,132
Shit.
[Grunts]

549
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:06,303
- Hey, everything okay?

550
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:07,538
- I'm going back to the torrent.

551
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,373
- You think that guy
did something to you

552
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:11,542
'cause you were a raging douche?

553
00:30:11,544 --> 00:30:13,343
- I'll sweet talk him.

554
00:30:13,345 --> 00:30:15,846
Get him to fix my hands, then...
Then I'll head to the castle.

555
00:30:15,848 --> 00:30:17,915
Everything's under control.

556
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:34,765
- [Coughs] Alice.

557
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:40,037
- Apology accepted.

558
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:44,374
That was you apologizing
for what you did.

559
00:30:44,376 --> 00:30:46,276
I just...

560
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:49,479
If we survive this,
I hope we can be friends still.

561
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:56,253
I know it may sound stupid,

562
00:30:56,255 --> 00:30:58,722
but that's what I'm mad
at you for,

563
00:30:58,724 --> 00:31:02,526
not... not the cheating part.

564
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:07,965
The part where what you did
made me lose you.

565
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:10,100
And you're a big part
of my life, Quentin.

566
00:31:10,102 --> 00:31:14,404
- You can never lose me, Alice.

567
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:16,240
I mean, you can avoid me,
you can hate me...

568
00:31:16,242 --> 00:31:18,609
- I don't hate you.

569
00:31:18,611 --> 00:31:21,378
- Well, you can't lose me.

570
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,447
Sorry.

571
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:32,055
- I just...
- I can't stop thinking.

572
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:34,758
We're gonna find
this epic spell, great.

573
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:39,229
But I'm afraid I'm just gonna...

574
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,298
Freeze again when the beast
is in front of me.

575
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,967
- You're thinking
about it wrong.

576
00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:45,569
Cool under pressure
is not a talent.

577
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:47,671
It's a... it's a skill,
and you need to practice.

578
00:31:47,673 --> 00:31:52,142
You... come on.

579
00:31:52,144 --> 00:31:54,444
We stood on a roof together
during the trials,

580
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:55,679
and you told me that you were
afraid to see

581
00:31:55,681 --> 00:31:59,483
what you're really capable of.

582
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:02,953
[Scoffs]
That was then.

583
00:32:02,955 --> 00:32:05,589
So let's see
what you can do now.

584
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:07,758
- I'm not sure it'll help.

585
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,793
- Then do it for me.
- I'm not gonna lie.

586
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:13,196
I... I'm dying to see
what you can do.

587
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:17,868
- I'm not a naturalist.

588
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:19,436
- You know the spell, we all do.

589
00:32:19,438 --> 00:32:21,505
We just sucked at it.

590
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:27,744
Let's see what you can do now.

591
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:45,529
- Oh.
- That feels...

592
00:32:45,531 --> 00:32:49,733
It's just like breathing.

593
00:32:49,735 --> 00:32:52,803
- See?
- Nice.

594
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:22,299
[Chuckles]
So how do you feel now?

595
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:42,386
- We're not getting back
together.

596
00:33:42,388 --> 00:33:44,454
- Okay.

597
00:33:57,903 --> 00:34:00,504
- I've been wondering something.

598
00:34:00,506 --> 00:34:03,106
Why didn't Reynard kill you
with your friends?

599
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:05,175
Why were you spared?

600
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:17,487
You weren't spared, were you?

601
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:19,456
- Look, let's not go there,
okay?

602
00:34:19,458 --> 00:34:21,792
- You know, when I was a boy,

603
00:34:21,794 --> 00:34:24,161
a man who was meant
to care for me

604
00:34:24,163 --> 00:34:27,364
bent me over his desk
and had me over and over

605
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:30,000
every time I was alone with him.

606
00:34:30,002 --> 00:34:32,636
It helps me understand a truth.

607
00:34:32,638 --> 00:34:36,306
You're powerful or you're weak.

608
00:34:36,308 --> 00:34:40,043
If you're powerful,
you will survive.

609
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:42,846
- So what, you're suggesting
I just get over it?

610
00:34:42,848 --> 00:34:44,915
- Actually, yes.

611
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:51,221
- How?
- Mutate?

612
00:34:51,223 --> 00:34:52,522
Take over a world,

613
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:54,191
kill a bunch of grad students
39 times?

614
00:34:54,193 --> 00:34:58,562
- [Chuckles]
Eh, see, what you feel,

615
00:34:58,564 --> 00:35:00,697
the haunted look in your eyes,

616
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:05,302
doesn't come from nowhere.

617
00:35:05,304 --> 00:35:07,637
- Then where does it come from?

618
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,406
- In the center of your being,

619
00:35:09,408 --> 00:35:13,677
there's a tiny beating heart.

620
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:15,812
- What, you mean like my soul?

621
00:35:15,814 --> 00:35:18,315
- Part of it, yes,
the slimmest part,

622
00:35:18,317 --> 00:35:21,485
but it holds specific power.

623
00:35:21,487 --> 00:35:23,687
It's called a shade.

624
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:26,256
- Shade.

625
00:35:26,258 --> 00:35:28,425
- It's what makes you feel

626
00:35:28,427 --> 00:35:32,529
the pain will burn you
till there's nothing.

627
00:35:32,531 --> 00:35:34,664
And, yes, it's also there
for love,

628
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:36,700
but, uh, let's be Frank,
darling,

629
00:35:36,702 --> 00:35:38,535
you're more likely
to throw yourself off a bridge

630
00:35:38,537 --> 00:35:43,406
than ever love again.

631
00:35:43,408 --> 00:35:46,209
I felt that way.

632
00:35:46,211 --> 00:35:50,080
And I knew it crippled me
when I needed to be strong.

633
00:35:50,082 --> 00:35:52,149
As you do now.

634
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:00,991
You know...

635
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:07,531
I don't care for people,
as a rule.

636
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:17,040
I like you.

637
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:18,542
You have promise.

638
00:36:18,544 --> 00:36:22,979
With the right control,
you would be formidable.

639
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:27,617
Even a worthy collaborator.

640
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:30,687
I have plans.
You could be part of them.

641
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:35,825
- If?
- Do what I did.

642
00:36:35,827 --> 00:36:38,962
Sever your shade.

643
00:36:38,964 --> 00:36:42,165
- Sever.
- It's not hard.

644
00:36:42,167 --> 00:36:45,068
You'll feel better.

645
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,571
You'll feel happy.

646
00:36:47,573 --> 00:36:49,639
I can show you how.

647
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:55,145
- No, thank you.

648
00:36:55,147 --> 00:36:58,215
- Do let me know
if you change your mind.

649
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:07,257
[Humming]

650
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:15,198
<i>[Soft music]</i>

651
00:37:44,228 --> 00:37:47,297
[indistinct chatter]

652
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:51,968
- Eliot!

653
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:54,537
The crown suits you, of course.

654
00:37:54,539 --> 00:37:56,806
- Who are all these people?
- The Pickwick family.

655
00:37:56,808 --> 00:37:59,008
They've been running things
till children of earth came.

656
00:38:02,213 --> 00:38:03,580
- Your highness.

657
00:38:03,582 --> 00:38:05,081
Tick Pickwick
of the northern marsh Pickwicks,

658
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:06,683
at your service.

659
00:38:06,685 --> 00:38:08,818
The rest of the king's council
will arrive shortly.

660
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,855
- Great.
- So glad you're here.

661
00:38:11,857 --> 00:38:13,823
There are a few problems.

662
00:38:13,825 --> 00:38:15,692
Uh, several problems

663
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:17,327
that could use
your immediate attention.

664
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:19,929
- Ah, okay, great.
- We should probably get started.

665
00:38:19,931 --> 00:38:22,232
- First, your throne room.

666
00:38:22,234 --> 00:38:23,900
I'm afraid it's been locked
a long time.

667
00:38:23,902 --> 00:38:25,535
- We're looking for the key.
- That's fine.

668
00:38:25,537 --> 00:38:28,605
Uh, take me straight to
the armory.

669
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:34,311
- [Laughing]

670
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:40,950
[Laughing]
- [Unintelligible]

671
00:38:40,952 --> 00:38:43,019
- [Gasps]

672
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:10,113
- The armory,
your, uh, highnesses.

673
00:39:10,115 --> 00:39:12,315
- Well, this is underwhelming.

674
00:39:12,317 --> 00:39:15,385
- This is supposed to be
full of books.

675
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:19,723
- "Strategies for trapping

676
00:39:19,725 --> 00:39:21,825
tomato-eating garden fairies."

677
00:39:21,827 --> 00:39:23,893
Yeah, no.

678
00:39:23,895 --> 00:39:25,729
- Someone took
all the battle magic.

679
00:39:25,731 --> 00:39:28,431
- It's not like the beast
is coming to find us any second.

680
00:39:28,433 --> 00:39:30,567
- Wait, this is something.

681
00:39:30,569 --> 00:39:33,636
It's an... it's a workbook
on spells, serious ones.

682
00:39:33,638 --> 00:39:35,572
Looks like battle magic.

683
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:37,407
But the actual spells
aren't here.

684
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:40,810
- Hmm, like notes on cake,
but no actual recipes.

685
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:42,946
That's helpful.

686
00:39:42,948 --> 00:39:45,682
Who wrote it?

687
00:39:45,684 --> 00:39:47,917
- Oh, my god.
- What?

688
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:49,986
- I know where we need to go.

689
00:39:52,356 --> 00:39:53,823
- Brakebills?

690
00:39:58,163 --> 00:40:02,365
- Hello?
- Mr., uh, Mr...

691
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:06,002
[grunting]

692
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:09,406
Fuck!

693
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:12,041
- Can I help you?

694
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:14,010
- Hell, yes, you can.
- These don't work.

695
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:15,578
- Well, by all means,
request a refund.

696
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,914
- Very funny.
- You did this on purpose.

697
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:20,884
- Did what? Help an ungrateful
child of earth?

698
00:40:20,886 --> 00:40:22,218
- Look, I'll pay you
whatever you want, okay?

699
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,553
I'm... I'm serious, okay?

700
00:40:23,555 --> 00:40:24,888
I'm friends
with the kings and queens.

701
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,790
You want to be a Duke,
great, I got you...

702
00:40:26,792 --> 00:40:29,292
- actions have consequences,
penny.

703
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:32,228
Even glib words spoken
in casual arrogance.

704
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:34,364
It's past time you learned,

705
00:40:34,366 --> 00:40:36,433
especially give the position
you'll occupy soon.

706
00:40:36,435 --> 00:40:37,767
- What position?

707
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:39,602
- You know what?
- I've done you a service.

708
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:41,471
- No, no, look, hey, I'm...

709
00:40:41,473 --> 00:40:44,307
I'm sorry, okay?

710
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:47,544
Please fix my hands.

711
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:50,647
- See, how do I put this
in a way that you'll understand?

712
00:40:50,649 --> 00:40:54,651
Ah, go fuck yourself.

713
00:40:54,653 --> 00:40:58,221
- No, wait!

714
00:40:58,223 --> 00:41:00,290
Fuck!

715
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:06,095
- Hang onto this while I'm gone.

716
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:08,798
- Oh.

717
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,567
You guys all packed?

718
00:41:10,569 --> 00:41:14,304
- Yeah.

719
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:17,273
El, thank you.

720
00:41:17,275 --> 00:41:19,909
- For what?
- For, um, taking one for the team

721
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:21,978
to the tune
of the rest of my life?

722
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:26,783
[Exhales deeply] I'm trying
to see this ruling thing

723
00:41:26,785 --> 00:41:29,185
as an adventure.

724
00:41:29,187 --> 00:41:31,955
Apparently we have enemies
to the north and south.

725
00:41:31,957 --> 00:41:36,092
Plus broken infrastructure
and huge magic issues

726
00:41:36,094 --> 00:41:38,862
thanks to the beast
and his wellspring addiction.

727
00:41:38,864 --> 00:41:41,598
And do you know they don't know
what champagne is here?

728
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,535
I plan on inventing it.

729
00:41:45,537 --> 00:41:47,370
I'd like to be known as...

730
00:41:47,372 --> 00:41:50,807
The champagne king.

731
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:52,008
- It has a ring to it.

732
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,710
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

733
00:41:53,712 --> 00:41:56,613
- I'm really looking forward
to drinking socially,

734
00:41:56,615 --> 00:41:58,681
like the French.

735
00:42:03,721 --> 00:42:07,457
So, uh, in the books,

736
00:42:07,459 --> 00:42:09,959
time doesn't exactly run
the same speed

737
00:42:09,961 --> 00:42:13,796
on earth as in Fillory.

738
00:42:13,798 --> 00:42:15,231
- I mean, look, sometimes
it got screwy

739
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:18,067
when Jane and Martin
would go back and forth.

740
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:20,136
- But not always.

741
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:24,374
- It's gonna be fine.

742
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,077
- Yeah.

743
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,646
Yeah.

744
00:42:29,648 --> 00:42:32,382
Or I'll just live out my days

745
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:35,451
waiting for my friends
to return and die alone.

746
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:45,929
You know, it's considered
extremely disrespectful

747
00:42:45,931 --> 00:42:48,998
to touch a king
without permission.

748
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:55,204
But, um, I think you should...

749
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:58,274
Probably hug me right now.

750
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:05,582
[Exhales deeply]

751
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:09,385
It'll also be okay if you just

752
00:43:09,387 --> 00:43:11,888
give my ass, like,
a little squeeze.

753
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:14,857
[Laughter]

754
00:43:14,859 --> 00:43:19,228
- Feel free to, uh, double-check
this before I get started.

755
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:21,297
Julia?

756
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:36,212
- Why do you want to help me

757
00:43:36,214 --> 00:43:39,048
with my shade?

758
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:40,650
- Without your shade,

759
00:43:40,652 --> 00:43:45,254
you would see
a lot of things differently.

760
00:43:45,256 --> 00:43:49,058
You'd be able to live, Julia.

761
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:51,094
Come here.

762
00:43:51,096 --> 00:43:53,162
Let me show you.

763
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:02,639
[Muttering]

764
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:08,177
<i>[Soft music]</i>

765
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:15,018
- [breathes deeply]

766
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:27,664
- We're there.
- Put it back.

767
00:44:27,666 --> 00:44:31,000
- It's okay, it's okay.

768
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:34,103
- I need it.

769
00:44:34,105 --> 00:44:37,173
Put it back now, Martin.

770
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,877
- Suit yourself.

771
00:44:40,879 --> 00:44:42,879
- [Gasps]

772
00:44:42,881 --> 00:44:45,882
<i>[Eerie music]</i>

773
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:03,666
- I understand
why you're afraid.

774
00:45:03,668 --> 00:45:06,069
You don't want to lose yourself.

775
00:45:06,071 --> 00:45:08,371
But hear me on this.

776
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:10,139
Martyring yourself to your pain

777
00:45:10,141 --> 00:45:11,741
isn't all it's advertised to be.

778
00:45:11,743 --> 00:45:14,811
It'll destroy you.

779
00:45:14,813 --> 00:45:18,081
There's no glory in that.

780
00:45:18,083 --> 00:45:21,918
You might get Reynard, yes.

781
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,054
But he'll still win.

782
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:27,056
Anyways.
