00:00:00,899 --> 00:00:02,554
<i>Previously on</i> THE MAGICIANS...

2
00:00:02,602 --> 00:00:05,155
We summoned some kind of killer
moth man from another world.

3
00:00:05,203 --> 00:00:06,960
My friends who got separated
and I just...

4
00:00:07,055 --> 00:00:08,468
I can't let them fight
The Beast on their own.

5
00:00:08,552 --> 00:00:10,795
You want me to come
to Fillory with you?

6
00:00:10,815 --> 00:00:12,948
All right, so there might be
a solution here, a weapon.

7
00:00:12,951 --> 00:00:14,050
It sounds like, if we could find it,

8
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:15,151
we could use it to kill The Beast.

9
00:00:15,237 --> 00:00:17,286
- Payment is due.
- Apparently marriage here

10
00:00:17,325 --> 00:00:19,455
- is different.
- I can never leave Fillory.

11
00:00:19,537 --> 00:00:21,523
I have gifted you my Bestowal.

12
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,759
When you are ready to face The Beast,

13
00:00:23,796 --> 00:00:25,094
imbibe it.

14
00:00:25,107 --> 00:00:26,262
We followed all the clues.

15
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:29,798
We thought
that She was leading us to Her.

16
00:00:29,815 --> 00:00:31,909
- We summoned Her.
- You know, I actually believed

17
00:00:31,954 --> 00:00:33,869
Our Lady Underground chose me.

18
00:00:33,877 --> 00:00:36,438
You may address me
as Reynard the Fox,

19
00:00:36,449 --> 00:00:39,174
Trickster of the faithful,
the pure of heart,

20
00:00:39,278 --> 00:00:40,612
the very stupid.

21
00:00:42,953 --> 00:00:44,647
Hi, Martin.

22
00:00:52,561 --> 00:00:54,464
Ahh!

23
00:00:54,752 --> 00:00:55,831
Wait.

24
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:56,833
You know how to deal with Gods.

25
00:00:56,868 --> 00:00:59,268
- You know how to fuck up their shit.
- No.

26
00:00:59,353 --> 00:01:01,771
- I want to make a deal.
- Let's.

After all that being chased?

43
00:02:25,623 --> 00:02:27,187
No, um, I'm not being chased.

44
00:02:27,234 --> 00:02:30,664
Oh.
Usually they're being chased.

45
00:02:30,992 --> 00:02:33,885
That I know of, no.

46
00:02:34,156 --> 00:02:37,355
But you do need some kind of help.

47
00:02:38,023 --> 00:02:39,835
Uh, it's just where
I come from there's a legend

48
00:02:39,883 --> 00:02:43,327
about a witch
with a cottage made of candy.

49
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:44,773
Well, the cottage is mostly wood,

50
00:02:44,821 --> 00:02:47,474
and I'm more of a healer and...

51
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,342
gardening enthusiast.

52
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:52,172
Okay.

53
00:02:52,484 --> 00:02:53,968
I need your help.

54
00:02:54,109 --> 00:02:56,249
And you're offering...?

55
00:02:56,523 --> 00:02:59,570
- Offering? Um...
- Gold... is always good.

56
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,828
You would be helping
the next High King of Fillory.

57
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,289
Okay.

58
00:03:03,336 --> 00:03:05,233
Then my discount rate.

59
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,789
One vial.

60
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,092
Vial of what?

61
00:03:08,139 --> 00:03:09,547
Were you dropped on your head
as a child?

62
00:03:09,595 --> 00:03:11,681
Your blood, dum-dum.

63
00:03:20,672 --> 00:03:23,494
There you are.

64
00:03:23,944 --> 00:03:26,217
We were so worried.

65
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:29,064
You're, uh...

66
00:03:32,563 --> 00:03:35,251
God-powered.

67
00:03:36,532 --> 00:03:39,896
So it's a little hard
to kill me at the moment.

68
00:03:43,165 --> 00:03:45,258
Ahh!

69
00:03:45,415 --> 00:03:47,540
Thank God.

70
00:03:47,766 --> 00:03:50,258
I mean, you know,

71
00:03:50,532 --> 00:03:53,954
thank God, Alice.

72
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,112
I hesitated.

73
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,856
With The Beast,
I should have... it's...

74
00:04:01,903 --> 00:04:02,982
it's my fault.

75
00:04:03,029 --> 00:04:04,225
No, it's not, I...

76
00:04:04,272 --> 00:04:05,484
No, he's right.

77
00:04:05,531 --> 00:04:06,527
It's Julia's fault.

78
00:04:06,574 --> 00:04:07,579
No, guys.

79
00:04:07,627 --> 00:04:10,258
- She... she's not sane.
- You think?

80
00:04:10,336 --> 00:04:11,591
One small consolation

81
00:04:11,638 --> 00:04:13,234
is the bitch is
with The Beast right now,

82
00:04:13,281 --> 00:04:15,203
and I can't really see
that going her way.

83
00:04:15,313 --> 00:04:18,664
No, it, uh,
I'll explain it in a second.

84
00:04:18,711 --> 00:04:21,779
Um, can I have my blood back, please?

85
00:04:23,049 --> 00:04:24,212
Look, my friends, they're fine.

86
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:26,881
- I don't need your...
- No.

87
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:29,446
I took an hour out of my night.

88
00:04:30,149 --> 00:04:32,180
You're in Fillory, Magician.

89
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:34,501
Be careful with strangers.

90
00:04:34,735 --> 00:04:37,528
We only look whimsical.

91
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:43,412
- Who was that?
- Uh, a local.

92
00:04:43,762 --> 00:04:46,285
Okay, fuckers, huddle up.

93
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,340
Zillion bucks says The Beast
comes back any minute,

94
00:04:48,543 --> 00:04:49,685
so what's the plan?

95
00:04:49,732 --> 00:04:52,813
We lost the blade,
so we need a new something.

96
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:55,215
Um, especially while Alice
is still...

97
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:56,987
- Juiced up?
- We should all juice up.

98
00:04:57,035 --> 00:05:00,457
Like The Beast.
Wellspring smoothies, stat.

99
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:13,133
Ahh!
Shit.

100
00:05:13,293 --> 00:05:15,293
There's a missing piece right there.

101
00:05:15,543 --> 00:05:18,152
Oh, hey, I think I...
uh, yeah.

102
00:05:18,645 --> 00:05:19,739
Ahh!

103
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,348
This is going great.

104
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:23,454
Let me try.

105
00:05:30,778 --> 00:05:34,137
Wow, swallowing has its privileges.

106
00:05:54,043 --> 00:05:56,840
- Wow, it looks like...
- A major drought's hit.

107
00:05:57,176 --> 00:05:59,535
There's a bucket.

108
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:07,665
Shit.

109
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:14,694
I knew The Beast came here
every day, but is it...

110
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,157
but is it even possible for him

111
00:06:16,205 --> 00:06:17,764
to drain the Wellspring that much?

112
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:19,341
He really threw something
out of whack.

113
00:06:19,392 --> 00:06:21,043
I vote we don't touch it
on the grounds

114
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:22,945
that exploding Fillory wouldn't help.

115
00:06:22,992 --> 00:06:24,246
Okay.
We need a new plan.

116
00:06:24,293 --> 00:06:26,181
- What plan?
- The Beast is gone.

117
00:06:26,228 --> 00:06:29,008
Our squad is a joke.
What plan, exactly?

118
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:30,752
We'll figure it out.
We always do.

119
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:32,548
When it's a final to cheat on,

120
00:06:32,596 --> 00:06:34,681
not when we're stuck
in some epic fantasy

121
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:38,409
that likes to behead its heroes
halfway through season one.

122
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:42,393
If we even are heroes.

123
00:06:42,948 --> 00:06:46,304
We might be comic relief.

124
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,938
I thought you threw that out.

125
00:06:49,985 --> 00:06:53,008
It's for emergencies.
Pass it around.

126
00:06:53,244 --> 00:06:56,760
Okay.
No Wellspring, no knife.

127
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:59,072
I have no idea what to do now.

128
00:06:59,182 --> 00:07:01,016
So we are fucked without grease.

129
00:07:01,063 --> 00:07:04,820
- That sounds like us.
- Must be a Monday.

130
00:07:05,104 --> 00:07:07,041
Onward to glory.

134
00:07:30,373 --> 00:07:32,414
Ah, the food is tremendous.

135
00:07:32,506 --> 00:07:35,155
Let's sit.

136
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:39,451
- You familiar?
- Word as bond?

137
00:07:39,623 --> 00:07:42,513
Uh, I assume the extra bits
enchant the blade

138
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:44,126
to kill me instantly

139
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:47,030
in the event I break it, eh.

140
00:07:47,912 --> 00:07:49,365
Okay, here's the deal...

141
00:07:49,413 --> 00:07:52,037
You need to kill a god.

142
00:07:52,381 --> 00:07:54,186
Thrilling.

143
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:56,295
So you need to get near him.

144
00:07:56,537 --> 00:07:59,787
- Tricky.
- Yes, but you can help.

145
00:07:59,922 --> 00:08:01,835
Mm.

146
00:08:02,342 --> 00:08:05,038
His... name
is Reynard the Fox.

147
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:08,341
A trickster of some sorts, yes?

148
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:10,176
Oh, that will be a challenge.

149
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,354
Well, you don't really have
much choice, do you?

150
00:08:12,401 --> 00:08:15,894
Oh, well aware you have
that stylish little blade.

151
00:08:16,171 --> 00:08:17,910
I sure do.

152
00:08:18,394 --> 00:08:20,762
That reminds me to insist
the terms of our deal

153
00:08:20,809 --> 00:08:23,159
include said blade reverting to me

154
00:08:23,207 --> 00:08:25,550
at the moment of Reynard's demise.

155
00:08:25,647 --> 00:08:27,827
- Agreed?
- Almost.

156
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:29,738
First, for the duration
of our agreement,

157
00:08:29,785 --> 00:08:32,082
you do not hurt
or act against me in any way.

158
00:08:32,175 --> 00:08:34,183
Mm, fine.

159
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:38,082
Quentin, all of them.

160
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:40,746
You lay a finger,

161
00:08:40,963 --> 00:08:44,761
this will put this

162
00:08:45,246 --> 00:08:48,482
in the base of your skull.

163
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,518
You're not what I expected.

164
00:08:50,566 --> 00:08:53,762
Once Reynard is dead,
I put the knife down.

165
00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:56,022
Yours to take.

166
00:08:56,261 --> 00:08:58,792
So this Reynard's still out there?

167
00:08:58,925 --> 00:09:00,027
As far as she knows.

168
00:09:00,075 --> 00:09:01,970
Yeah, it's why she needed the knife

169
00:09:02,017 --> 00:09:03,438
and why she needs The Beast.

170
00:09:03,485 --> 00:09:05,640
Okay, I get it now,
but I also have to say

171
00:09:05,687 --> 00:09:08,743
that is the dumbest thing
she could possibly have done.

172
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,261
Like I said,
she's not sane right now.

173
00:09:11,316 --> 00:09:13,002
- I wouldn't be.
- So what are we supposed to do?

174
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,089
- Kill The Beast.
- He's right.

175
00:09:15,207 --> 00:09:16,576
You know, it's awful,

176
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:18,211
but she chose
to double-cross us.

177
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:20,924
Look, I'm pissed too,
but I would like to point out...

178
00:09:20,972 --> 00:09:22,988
Okay, we don't have to take
a vote right this second.

179
00:09:23,049 --> 00:09:24,464
Penny's right. First things first.

180
00:09:24,512 --> 00:09:27,105
We need to make a plan
to deal with The Beast.

181
00:09:27,207 --> 00:09:28,888
Eliot!

182
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,265
I thought for sure you...

183
00:09:30,312 --> 00:09:33,126
Yeah, me too. Not yet.

184
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:35,324
Are... are you all right?

185
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,740
Um, I'll... I'll get everyone
something to eat.

186
00:09:38,933 --> 00:09:41,179
That would be amazing.

187
00:09:43,027 --> 00:09:45,871
I think I like her.

188
00:09:46,834 --> 00:09:49,068
I hope I like her.

189
00:09:54,558 --> 00:09:56,925
Um, okay.
This might be something.

190
00:09:56,972 --> 00:10:00,553
Um, so there's a-a-a place

191
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,963
called The Armory.

192
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,390
- Weapons?
- Books.

193
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:07,484
Uh, So Rupert Chatwin,

194
00:10:07,624 --> 00:10:10,031
uh, he realizes that back home,

195
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,406
World War II is still raging

196
00:10:11,453 --> 00:10:14,075
and he tells Jane and Martin
that he is going...

197
00:10:14,122 --> 00:10:16,912
he's... he's going to go fight.
Before he does,

198
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,890
uh, he spends all night
in The Armory reading.

199
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:22,851
Uh, and, uh, you know,
like, whatever he finds,

200
00:10:22,898 --> 00:10:25,111
it doesn't say,

201
00:10:25,234 --> 00:10:29,758
but his next move
is to petition Ember and Umber

202
00:10:29,805 --> 00:10:31,217
for strength.

203
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:33,094
I mean, what...
what if he found something?

204
00:10:33,141 --> 00:10:35,321
What if he found, uh, a spell

205
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:38,791
or a piece of, I don't know,
Fillorian Battle Magic

206
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,936
that was so strong
that he couldn't do it without...

207
00:10:40,983 --> 00:10:42,704
- Without juice?
- Yeah, because the...

208
00:10:42,751 --> 00:10:45,445
okay, the thing is, this is, uh,

209
00:10:45,493 --> 00:10:48,898
December, 1944.

210
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:50,879
I mean, he shows up
right in the middle of the...

211
00:10:50,926 --> 00:10:53,468
Battle of the Bulge.

212
00:10:54,835 --> 00:10:58,186
Wait, are you saying
that Rupert secretly...

213
00:10:58,272 --> 00:11:00,680
I'm saying, uh...

214
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:05,126
maybe he found something
powerful enough to help.

215
00:11:05,173 --> 00:11:07,362
And win World War II?

216
00:11:07,409 --> 00:11:09,935
Maybe.

217
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,404
Well then, I need The Armory.
Where is it?

218
00:11:13,482 --> 00:11:16,599
Castle Whitespire.
Accessible to...

219
00:11:16,732 --> 00:11:17,826
the King.

220
00:11:17,874 --> 00:11:20,266
Oh, hey.

221
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:22,833
And if we can find
the road, there's, um,

222
00:11:22,951 --> 00:11:25,480
a carriage that runs
in a continuous circle, uh,

223
00:11:25,527 --> 00:11:27,990
also at the disposal
of the King, so...

224
00:11:28,044 --> 00:11:31,511
- Okay.
- Whitespire it is.

225
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:34,635
Come on, everybody.
Grab snacks.

226
00:11:34,689 --> 00:11:36,142
Yeah, uh, about that.

227
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,799
My hands are in a fucking box,

228
00:11:37,908 --> 00:11:39,635
so Chatwin's Torrent.

229
00:11:39,721 --> 00:11:43,221
I-I know that one.
It's, um, it's a healing river.

230
00:11:43,322 --> 00:11:45,258
- Can it reattach hands?
- Maybe.

231
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:47,460
I'm going.
I'll catch you on the flip.

232
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:49,404
Wait, no, I don't think
you should be going alone.

233
00:11:49,451 --> 00:11:53,236
I'll go.
Um, healing water?

234
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:56,681
We're going to battle.
I'll grab, like, a gallon.

235
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,557
You're wiping your own ass,
so figure that out.

236
00:12:15,424 --> 00:12:17,657
- Souvenir?
- Barometer.

237
00:12:17,986 --> 00:12:21,596
Thought I should pay attention
to see if it gets warm.

238
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:27,986
Whoa. Hey, guys.

239
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,236
Hey, over here!

240
00:12:30,322 --> 00:12:32,166
Oh, my God,
those horses are so beautiful.

241
00:12:32,228 --> 00:12:34,082
Uh, hey.
What are you doing?

242
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:36,635
- I just really love horses.
- Come on.

243
00:12:36,683 --> 00:12:38,073
Hup!

244
00:12:40,455 --> 00:12:42,682
You have got to be kidding me.

245
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:44,917
I know, those horses were so rude.

246
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:46,166
I guess they're a tad literal.

247
00:12:46,214 --> 00:12:48,396
Yeah. I'd call needing to see
an actual crown

248
00:12:48,443 --> 00:12:50,265
on my head as pretty goddamn literal.

249
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:52,492
Look, it's not just
about the carriage.

250
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:54,402
They're not gonna let us
into Whitespire

251
00:12:54,449 --> 00:12:56,404
until you've been crowned
High King, so...

252
00:12:56,451 --> 00:12:59,489
So we... we need
to get you crowned.

253
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:02,138
Uh...

254
00:13:02,802 --> 00:13:04,946
Okay, yeah.
Um, so there's a...

255
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:08,550
there's a specific coronation place

256
00:13:08,597 --> 00:13:10,143
in the forest.

257
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,763
There are four kings and queens.

258
00:13:11,818 --> 00:13:15,521
Yeah, you get to pick
the other three.

259
00:13:16,363 --> 00:13:17,763
Do I get to be a king?

260
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:19,997
Unless you want me to pick Penny.

261
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:23,264
So, okay, so we get
to the coronation spot

262
00:13:23,311 --> 00:13:25,100
by crossing the Rainbow Bridge.

263
00:13:25,147 --> 00:13:28,370
Rainbow Bridge? Like where
family pets go when they die?

264
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:30,163
No.
I mean, not that I know of.

265
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,774
No, it's called that because of
the flowers that are everywhere.

266
00:13:32,821 --> 00:13:35,210
- Oh.
- Um, but there is, of course,

267
00:13:35,257 --> 00:13:36,803
no map,

268
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,281
but I know Martin found it
with a spell.

269
00:13:40,328 --> 00:13:44,085
Well, we could always
just ask around.

270
00:13:44,132 --> 00:13:47,091
Or we could make like Martin.

271
00:14:02,008 --> 00:14:03,596
He loves me.

272
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:05,073
He loves me not.

273
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,533
He loves me.

274
00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:09,543
He loves me not.

275
00:14:10,465 --> 00:14:12,918
Uh, he loves me.
Let's go.

276
00:14:25,645 --> 00:14:26,989
Ah.

277
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:30,090
Uh, please know
I heard every loophole.

278
00:14:30,364 --> 00:14:32,934
"Put the knife down."

279
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,996
You really think
you have a fighting chance?

280
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,573
I think I'm gonna give it my best.

281
00:14:39,067 --> 00:14:41,879
Oh, this is going to be fun.

282
00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:47,361
Nice of Reynard to pull
so many hearts out of chests.

283
00:14:47,409 --> 00:14:49,315
It's, uh, distinctive.

284
00:14:51,665 --> 00:14:54,073
Why do you suppose he does that?

285
00:14:54,298 --> 00:14:57,179
- He likes the taste.
- Mm.

286
00:14:58,977 --> 00:15:02,148
Brilliant, that, uh, laptop.

287
00:15:02,196 --> 00:15:04,484
The things they come up with
when they don't have magic.

288
00:15:04,531 --> 00:15:07,787
Yeah, like accounts that tweet
police scanner activity.

289
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:09,290
"Tweet"?

290
00:15:09,554 --> 00:15:12,251
Birds have computer accounts?

291
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:14,794
Don't worry about it.

292
00:15:14,938 --> 00:15:18,222
- Mm.
- Wait a minute.

293
00:15:18,587 --> 00:15:21,533
They found five bodies
at a house in Florida.

294
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:23,639
Missing a couple of hearts.

295
00:15:26,944 --> 00:15:31,647
Okay, just try to keep people
away for a minute.

296
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:35,288
- Nicely.
- Mm-hmm.

297
00:15:35,712 --> 00:15:39,254
Hey, is this seat taken?

298
00:15:44,867 --> 00:15:45,930
Excuse me, sir, this is...

299
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:48,369
Won't be but a moment.

300
00:16:19,493 --> 00:16:21,327
He's still in Richard's body.

301
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:24,102
Richard doesn't care, darling.

302
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,702
I fucking do.

303
00:16:29,298 --> 00:16:31,859
Well, so I guess
we came for not much.

304
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:35,065
On the contrary, we've
verified what attracts Reynard.

305
00:16:35,112 --> 00:16:36,687
What?
Witches doing rituals?

306
00:16:36,735 --> 00:16:38,673
I mean, that's thousands
of people every day.

307
00:16:38,891 --> 00:16:41,850
Not this type of ritual.

308
00:16:44,722 --> 00:16:46,688
Come on.

309
00:16:55,466 --> 00:16:58,689
So, what do I do?

310
00:16:58,736 --> 00:17:00,766
Well, per the books,

311
00:17:00,813 --> 00:17:03,970
you strip and jump in, I guess.

312
00:17:04,634 --> 00:17:06,230
Here, I'll help you.

313
00:17:06,277 --> 00:17:08,774
You'll need to help him
sew those back on his wrists.

314
00:17:08,821 --> 00:17:11,377
- Who are you?
- I watch the river.

315
00:17:11,424 --> 00:17:14,816
And assist those
who require its magic.

316
00:17:17,889 --> 00:17:20,122
This guy is fucking weird.

317
00:17:27,431 --> 00:17:29,531
Go on.

318
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:40,242
Go. Go, go.

319
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:50,534
You know, you're very beautiful.

320
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:52,542
Where are you from, hmm?

321
00:17:52,651 --> 00:17:53,877
Earth?

322
00:17:53,924 --> 00:17:56,745
Love women from Earth.

323
00:17:57,065 --> 00:17:59,091
Is it supposed to take this long?

324
00:17:59,138 --> 00:18:02,186
No.
He may have drowned.

325
00:18:02,233 --> 00:18:03,996
Are you kidding?
Why didn't you...

326
00:18:04,043 --> 00:18:07,310
Oh, oh, oh.
There we go.

327
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:10,302
Are you sure I can't interest
you in an elixir?

328
00:18:10,349 --> 00:18:12,332
It... it's small batch
and very fresh.

329
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,865
- No, thank you.
- I have a tooth powder

330
00:18:14,943 --> 00:18:16,609
that I think you are going to love.

331
00:18:16,656 --> 00:18:19,045
You know what?
We're kinda in a hurry.

332
00:18:19,216 --> 00:18:21,294
I understand.
As you wish.

333
00:18:21,388 --> 00:18:23,685
Pleasure to serve.

334
00:18:25,623 --> 00:18:26,927
I think he wants a tip.

335
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,746
20 gold pieces is customary.

336
00:18:28,793 --> 00:18:30,347
Okay, that sounds like a lot.

337
00:18:30,394 --> 00:18:31,757
Well, this is Chatwin's Torrent.

338
00:18:31,804 --> 00:18:33,917
We don't have...
there was nothing

339
00:18:33,964 --> 00:18:35,561
about charging in the books.

340
00:18:35,608 --> 00:18:37,982
Oh, uh, you'd rather pay in labor?

341
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:39,465
I think three to five years.

342
00:18:39,512 --> 00:18:41,458
Are you fucking kidding me?

343
00:18:41,505 --> 00:18:43,969
You said none of this
before I went in the river.

344
00:18:44,016 --> 00:18:45,429
Because I have manners...

345
00:18:45,476 --> 00:18:48,074
Are you even officially
affiliated with the Torrent?

346
00:18:48,121 --> 00:18:49,233
Penny, chill out.

347
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,518
It's kind of an amateur calling.

348
00:18:50,566 --> 00:18:52,645
Oh, I see.
Yes, yes, you're a con man.

349
00:18:52,692 --> 00:18:55,572
- No, Penny...
- No, I know his type.

350
00:18:55,619 --> 00:18:57,583
I've been ripped off plenty of times

351
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:01,278
by smiling little snake oil
pricks like this dude.

352
00:19:01,325 --> 00:19:02,888
- Okay, all right.
- Same in Detroit,

353
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:05,582
same in Mumbai, same in Fillory.

354
00:19:05,629 --> 00:19:07,760
- Okay.
- Sorry, try it on the next sap

355
00:19:07,807 --> 00:19:12,665
who needs this natural resource
on public property.

356
00:19:12,712 --> 00:19:14,224
Good luck.

357
00:19:14,271 --> 00:19:17,127
I'm sorry.
He gets touchy.

358
00:19:17,174 --> 00:19:19,305
It's... it's not personal.

359
00:19:19,352 --> 00:19:22,622
Um, these are diamond.

360
00:19:22,739 --> 00:19:26,114
- What the hell is diamond?
- Here.

361
00:19:26,247 --> 00:19:28,614
When you meet one scammer,
you met 'em all. Let's go.

362
00:19:28,661 --> 00:19:30,852
Okay.

363
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:46,174
Okay, so this net...
this net you throw,

364
00:19:46,276 --> 00:19:47,764
what sort of a net catches a god?

365
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,340
Oh, it's an obscure bit of casting,

366
00:19:49,387 --> 00:19:51,167
but I assure you it works.

367
00:19:51,214 --> 00:19:53,912
We'll just have to act fast
when the time comes.

368
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:56,347
It'll hold for a few seconds.

369
00:19:56,547 --> 00:19:58,299
So...

370
00:19:59,507 --> 00:20:01,907
I need a few items.

371
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,060
Okay, it might be better for
me to go alone for some of this.

372
00:20:09,107 --> 00:20:11,354
Uh, can you drop me
at the playground?

373
00:20:11,648 --> 00:20:13,578
I like to watch
the little children play.

374
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:16,370
It's perfectly innocent.

375
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:34,152
Al, we got your note.

376
00:20:34,383 --> 00:20:36,579
Let's do this.

377
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:38,750
I call High Queen.

378
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,609
Did it work?

379
00:20:40,703 --> 00:20:43,403
Perfect.
Lead the way.

380
00:20:53,732 --> 00:20:56,766
It's fine.
They're just healing.

381
00:21:10,693 --> 00:21:14,325
♪ So you showed me
around your town♪

382
00:21:14,372 --> 00:21:17,420

392
00:21:46,861 --> 00:21:49,708
Do you think he's sleeping or dead?

393
00:21:49,755 --> 00:21:51,686
I don't know, should we just
go into the trunk?

394
00:21:51,733 --> 00:21:54,547
Oh, pussies.

395
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:57,694
- He looks dead.
- I guess we're late.

396
00:22:04,046 --> 00:22:06,479
Oh, dear.

397
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:12,843
Oh, dear.

398
00:22:17,874 --> 00:22:20,772
I am the Knight of Crowns.

399
00:22:20,929 --> 00:22:23,275
Uh, my apologies.

400
00:22:23,322 --> 00:22:27,989
I seem to have died waiting
for you aspirants to come.

401
00:22:28,171 --> 00:22:31,530
Y-Y-You are aspirants?

402
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,505
Uh...

403
00:22:34,108 --> 00:22:36,455
I'm the High King of Fillory.

404
00:22:36,502 --> 00:22:38,038
I took a blood test.

405
00:22:38,194 --> 00:22:42,342
Excellent, excellent.
It's an honor.

406
00:22:42,889 --> 00:22:44,889
Can we have the crowns, please?

407
00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:47,241
Certainly.
Honored to oblige.

408
00:22:47,288 --> 00:22:49,936
Just as soon as you pass the test.

409
00:22:50,686 --> 00:22:52,507
Of course there's a test.

410
00:22:52,905 --> 00:22:56,866
As you know, only a Child Of Earth

411
00:22:57,053 --> 00:23:00,280
can wear the crown of the High King.

412
00:23:00,491 --> 00:23:02,414
I will ask you a series of questions

413
00:23:02,461 --> 00:23:05,192
designed to root out
all pretenders to the throne.

414
00:23:05,239 --> 00:23:08,195
Only a true High King
will hold the answers

415
00:23:08,327 --> 00:23:10,634
in his heart.

416
00:23:12,913 --> 00:23:15,374
Come at me.

417
00:23:16,366 --> 00:23:20,308
What popular American
television program

418
00:23:20,592 --> 00:23:23,235
stars actor Tim Daly?

419
00:23:23,483 --> 00:23:24,670
What the fuck?

420
00:23:24,936 --> 00:23:26,605
He was in a lot of TV shows.

421
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,482
There is only one correct answer.

422
00:23:28,529 --> 00:23:30,351
Okay.
Give me the next question.

423
00:23:30,398 --> 00:23:34,813
This hit single
is performed by offspring

424
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,590
of famous entertainers.

425
00:23:36,637 --> 00:23:39,318
Dude, that is crazy vague.

426
00:23:39,365 --> 00:23:41,562
You will receive a single hint.

427
00:23:41,609 --> 00:23:44,423
Your hint is Beach Boys.

428
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:47,860
"Hold On" by Wilson Phillips.

429
00:23:47,907 --> 00:23:49,528
That song is my jam.

430
00:23:49,575 --> 00:23:52,431
Wait, all these questions
are from the '90s.

431
00:23:52,478 --> 00:23:55,242
It... it's not the 1990s
on Earth right now?

432
00:23:55,397 --> 00:23:57,001
No, it... it's 2017.

433
00:23:57,049 --> 00:24:00,982
Oh, and it's, uh, "Wings,"
the... the Tim Daly show. "Wings."

434
00:24:01,029 --> 00:24:05,069
- Of course you know that.
- Okay, '90s.

435
00:24:05,335 --> 00:24:07,905
Ask me something
about Patrick Swayze.

436
00:24:07,953 --> 00:24:10,144
You know of Swayze?

437
00:24:18,069 --> 00:24:22,260
Ahem.

438
00:24:22,308 --> 00:24:24,171
"Sorry about the disruption, folks,

439
00:24:24,249 --> 00:24:26,832
"but I always do the last dance
of the season.

440
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:28,809
"This year somebody told me not to.

441
00:24:28,856 --> 00:24:31,012
"So I'm gonna do my kind of dancing

442
00:24:31,059 --> 00:24:32,580
"with a great partner,

443
00:24:32,627 --> 00:24:35,182
"who's not only a terrific dancer.

444
00:24:35,229 --> 00:24:37,910
"Somebody who's taught me

445
00:24:37,957 --> 00:24:40,100
"that there are people out there
willing to stand up

446
00:24:40,148 --> 00:24:43,524
"for other people
no matter what it costs them.

447
00:24:43,836 --> 00:24:47,016
"Somebody who's taught me

448
00:24:48,164 --> 00:24:51,102
"about the kind of person
I want to be.

449
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:53,234
Miss Frances Houseman."

450
00:24:53,281 --> 00:24:57,596
Oh, Your Majesty.

451
00:24:57,965 --> 00:25:01,551
The crowns of Fillory are yours.

452
00:25:17,043 --> 00:25:19,035
So I guess we just put them on.

453
00:25:19,208 --> 00:25:20,529
No, God, stop.

454
00:25:20,576 --> 00:25:24,645
I mean, I just...
we should do a-a ceremony.

455
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:26,526
This is only gonna happen once.

456
00:25:26,573 --> 00:25:28,570
We are becoming kings and queens,

457
00:25:28,617 --> 00:25:33,606
so... it's important
and we should honor it.

458
00:25:34,355 --> 00:25:38,068
Just give me that.

459
00:25:38,802 --> 00:25:41,608
Kneel, Eliot Waugh.

460
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:45,607
Would you just do it?
It's gonna be quick, I promise.

461
00:25:51,131 --> 00:25:53,810
So, destiny is...
it's bullshit.

462
00:25:54,115 --> 00:25:56,881
But you are High King in your blood.

463
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,101
And somehow that makes sense,
you know?

464
00:25:59,148 --> 00:26:00,996
And I-I just...
for what it's worth,

465
00:26:01,044 --> 00:26:04,548
I think that you are going to be
a really good king.

466
00:26:04,847 --> 00:26:09,630
Um, so, um,
I-I dub thee,

467
00:26:09,677 --> 00:26:11,606
um, I don't know.

468
00:26:11,731 --> 00:26:14,443
Would you say, like,
you're more brave or merciful?

469
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:16,500
I'd say I'm neither.

470
00:26:17,051 --> 00:26:20,179
But I still plan to be
a spectacular monarch.

471
00:26:20,596 --> 00:26:22,695
I hereby dub thee

472
00:26:23,066 --> 00:26:25,913
High King Eliot

473
00:26:26,078 --> 00:26:28,794
the Spectacular.

474
00:26:31,813 --> 00:26:35,889
Wow, uh,

475
00:26:36,453 --> 00:26:39,371
this feels as natural as underwear.

476
00:26:43,336 --> 00:26:45,391
Thank you.

477
00:26:46,814 --> 00:26:49,188
By the power vested in me by...

478
00:26:49,659 --> 00:26:52,227
I have no idea,

479
00:26:52,703 --> 00:26:56,052
I do hereby crown you

480
00:26:56,099 --> 00:26:59,024
High Queen Margo

481
00:26:59,694 --> 00:27:00,922
the Destroyer.

482
00:27:01,008 --> 00:27:02,925
I mean that
in the best possible sense.

483
00:27:02,972 --> 00:27:07,699
Uh, all hail.
Everyone clap.

484
00:27:11,972 --> 00:27:15,638
I have known what you truly are

485
00:27:15,685 --> 00:27:18,532
since the day we met.

486
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:21,013
Long may you reign.

487
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:33,717
I feel it's incumbent upon me

488
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,560
to promise never again
to betray you like I did.

489
00:27:37,912 --> 00:27:41,858
I really...
really am sorry.

490
00:27:42,169 --> 00:27:46,334
I have some character defects.
I'm working on it.

491
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:49,470
Honestly.

492
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:58,547
I'm working on some too.

493
00:27:59,022 --> 00:28:00,936
Well, on that note,

494
00:28:00,996 --> 00:28:04,748
I crown you Queen Alice

495
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:07,159
the Wise.

496
00:28:16,604 --> 00:28:18,726
No, wait.

497
00:28:18,834 --> 00:28:22,207
Since we're cleaning slates
and shit, give me.

498
00:28:25,146 --> 00:28:27,983
Q.

499
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:32,873
Uh, I could start
by saying something cruel

500
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,337
yet totally hilarious about you.

501
00:28:35,765 --> 00:28:39,172
Let's be real, you're an easy target.

502
00:28:40,403 --> 00:28:42,040
But that's...

503
00:28:42,212 --> 00:28:45,188
well, that's because you're
honest about what you love.

504
00:28:45,708 --> 00:28:47,727
And underneath it all, that's...

505
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,779
inspiring.

506
00:28:52,306 --> 00:28:54,219
And I'm sorry too.

507
00:28:54,302 --> 00:28:55,699
Not about the sex,

508
00:28:55,785 --> 00:28:58,499
I don't even really remember it.

509
00:28:58,546 --> 00:29:01,944
Mostly my part in fucking up
something that was good for you.

510
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:05,305
Thanks, I think
I fucked it up just fine myself.

511
00:29:05,352 --> 00:29:07,650
Now that we're ruling
a kingdom together,

512
00:29:07,697 --> 00:29:10,085
I hope we can be
whatever we were again.

513
00:29:10,132 --> 00:29:12,602
I guess you could call that friends.

514
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,977
Let's go with that.

515
00:29:15,104 --> 00:29:18,680
I hereby crown you King Quentin

516
00:29:18,808 --> 00:29:23,498
the Moderately Socially Maladjusted.

517
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,412
- Scrunch down.
- Yeah.

518
00:29:37,785 --> 00:29:40,619
Royalty, bitches.

519
00:29:51,699 --> 00:29:53,935
Okay.

520
00:29:59,155 --> 00:30:01,106
Shit.

521
00:30:04,785 --> 00:30:06,474
Hey, everything okay?

522
00:30:06,614 --> 00:30:07,810
I'm going back to the Torrent.

523
00:30:07,856 --> 00:30:09,411
You think that guy
did something to you

524
00:30:09,459 --> 00:30:11,548
'cause you were a raging douche?

525
00:30:11,747 --> 00:30:13,177
I'll sweet-talk him.

526
00:30:13,247 --> 00:30:16,051
Get him to fix my hands, then...
then I'll head to the castle.

527
00:30:16,098 --> 00:30:18,490
Everything's under control.

528
00:30:31,939 --> 00:30:33,755
Alice.

529
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:39,349
Apology accepted.

530
00:30:40,247 --> 00:30:43,604
That was you apologizing
for what you did.

531
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,245
I just...

532
00:30:46,588 --> 00:30:50,120
if we survive this,
I hope we can be friends still.

533
00:30:53,057 --> 00:30:56,198
I know it may sound stupid,

534
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,837
but that's what I'm mad at you for,

535
00:30:59,932 --> 00:31:02,565
not... not the cheating part.

536
00:31:02,768 --> 00:31:06,901
The part where what you did
made me lose you.

537
00:31:08,331 --> 00:31:10,272
And you're a big part
of my life, Quentin.

538
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:14,468
You can never lose me, Alice.

539
00:31:14,667 --> 00:31:16,331
I mean, you can avoid me,
you can hate me...

540
00:31:16,414 --> 00:31:18,135
I don't hate you.

541
00:31:18,886 --> 00:31:21,221
Well, you can't lose me.

542
00:31:21,637 --> 00:31:24,028
Sorry.

543
00:31:27,612 --> 00:31:31,190
I just...
I can't stop thinking.

544
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,909
We're gonna find
this epic spell, great.

545
00:31:34,957 --> 00:31:39,326
But I'm afraid I'm just gonna...

546
00:31:39,401 --> 00:31:41,331
freeze again when The Beast
is in front of me.

547
00:31:41,384 --> 00:31:44,031
You're thinking about it wrong.

548
00:31:44,211 --> 00:31:45,674
Cool under pressure is not a talent.

549
00:31:45,721 --> 00:31:47,977
It's a... it's a skill,
and you need to practice.

550
00:31:48,024 --> 00:31:52,306
You... come on.

551
00:31:52,353 --> 00:31:54,541
We stood on a roof together
during the Trials,

552
00:31:54,588 --> 00:31:55,784
and you told me that you were
afraid to see

553
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:58,268
what you're really capable of.

554
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,974
That was then.

555
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,354
So let's see what you can do now.

556
00:32:05,713 --> 00:32:07,831
I'm not sure it'll help.

557
00:32:08,002 --> 00:32:09,999
Then do it for me.
I'm not gonna lie.

558
00:32:10,046 --> 00:32:13,705
I... I'm dying to see
what you can do.

559
00:32:16,243 --> 00:32:18,065
I'm not a Naturalist.

560
00:32:18,112 --> 00:32:19,742
You know the spell, we all do.

561
00:32:19,789 --> 00:32:22,180
We just sucked at it.

562
00:32:25,897 --> 00:32:28,330
Let's see what you can do now.

563
00:32:40,901 --> 00:32:44,362
Oh.
That feels...

564
00:32:45,854 --> 00:32:49,018
it's just like breathing.

565
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:53,352
See?
Nice.

566
00:33:20,236 --> 00:33:22,845
So how do you feel now?

567
00:33:40,263 --> 00:33:42,341
We're not getting back together.

568
00:33:42,389 --> 00:33:44,847
Okay.

569
00:33:58,122 --> 00:34:00,477
I've been wondering something.

570
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:03,190
Why didn't Reynard kill you
with your friends?

571
00:34:03,238 --> 00:34:05,429
Why were you spared?

572
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,724
You weren't spared, were you?

573
00:34:17,817 --> 00:34:19,605
Look, let's not go there, okay?

574
00:34:19,652 --> 00:34:21,832
You know, when I was a boy,

575
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:24,176
a man who was meant to care for me

576
00:34:24,223 --> 00:34:27,346
bent me over his desk
and had me over and over

577
00:34:27,393 --> 00:34:29,825
every time I was alone with him.

578
00:34:30,129 --> 00:34:32,669
It helps me understand a truth.

579
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:36,067
You're powerful or you're weak.

580
00:34:36,497 --> 00:34:40,084
If you're powerful, you will survive.

581
00:34:40,427 --> 00:34:42,962
So what, you're suggesting
I just get over it?

582
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,400
Actually, yes.

583
00:34:47,999 --> 00:34:51,138
How?
Mutate?

584
00:34:51,475 --> 00:34:52,663
Take over a world,

585
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:55,179
kill a bunch of grad students
39 times?

586
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:58,669
Eh, see, what you feel,

587
00:34:58,786 --> 00:35:00,846
the haunted look in your eyes,

588
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:04,429
doesn't come from nowhere.

589
00:35:05,725 --> 00:35:07,711
Then where does it come from?

590
00:35:07,991 --> 00:35:09,588
In the center of your being,

591
00:35:09,635 --> 00:35:12,749
there's a tiny beating heart.

592
00:35:14,218 --> 00:35:15,853
What, you mean like my soul?

593
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,497
Part of it, yes, the slimmest part,

594
00:35:18,544 --> 00:35:21,077
but it holds specific power.

595
00:35:21,772 --> 00:35:23,803
It's called a Shade.

596
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:26,230
Shade.

597
00:35:26,515 --> 00:35:28,407
It's what makes you feel

598
00:35:28,454 --> 00:35:31,733
the pain will burn you
till there's nothing.

599
00:35:32,538 --> 00:35:34,772
And, yes, it's also there for love,

600
00:35:34,819 --> 00:35:36,607
but, uh, let's be frank, darling,

601
00:35:36,654 --> 00:35:38,718
you're more likely
to throw yourself off a bridge

602
00:35:38,765 --> 00:35:41,319
than ever love again.

603
00:35:43,627 --> 00:35:45,593
I felt that way.

604
00:35:46,397 --> 00:35:50,249
And I knew it crippled me
when I needed to be strong.

605
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:52,601
As you do now.

606
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,593
You know...

607
00:36:04,733 --> 00:36:08,077
I don't care for people, as a rule.

608
00:36:14,561 --> 00:36:17,047
I like you.

609
00:36:17,311 --> 00:36:18,491
You have promise.

610
00:36:18,538 --> 00:36:21,827
With the right control,
you would be formidable.

611
00:36:23,366 --> 00:36:26,741
Even a worthy collaborator.

612
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:31,206
I have plans.
You could be part of them.

613
00:36:33,913 --> 00:36:35,941
- If?
- Do what I did.

614
00:36:36,085 --> 00:36:38,327
Sever your shade.

615
00:36:39,468 --> 00:36:42,248
- Sever.
- It's not hard.

616
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:45,109
You'll feel better.

617
00:36:45,343 --> 00:36:47,711
You'll feel happy.

618
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:50,192
I can show you how.

619
00:36:52,429 --> 00:36:54,960
No, thank you.

620
00:36:55,499 --> 00:36:58,667
Do let me know
if you change your mind.

621
00:37:50,049 --> 00:37:51,737
Eliot!

622
00:37:52,088 --> 00:37:54,655
The crown suits you, of course.

623
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,755
- Who are all these people?
- The Pickwick family.

624
00:37:56,802 --> 00:37:59,661
They've been running things
till Children of Earth came.

625
00:38:02,433 --> 00:38:03,487
Your Highness.

626
00:38:03,534 --> 00:38:05,331
Tick Pickwick
of the Northern Marsh Pickwicks,

627
00:38:05,378 --> 00:38:06,787
at your service.

628
00:38:06,842 --> 00:38:08,901
The rest of the King's Council
will arrive shortly.

629
00:38:08,948 --> 00:38:11,895
- Great.
- So glad you're here.

630
00:38:11,942 --> 00:38:13,906
There are a few problems.

631
00:38:13,952 --> 00:38:15,765
Uh, several problems

632
00:38:15,813 --> 00:38:17,309
that could use
your immediate attention.

633
00:38:17,356 --> 00:38:20,012
Ah, okay, great.
We should probably get started.

634
00:38:20,059 --> 00:38:22,206
First, your throne room.

635
00:38:22,253 --> 00:38:23,816
I'm afraid it's been locked
a long time.

636
00:38:23,863 --> 00:38:25,517
- We're looking for the key.
- That's fine.

637
00:38:25,564 --> 00:38:28,957
Uh, take me straight to the Armory.

638
00:39:05,632 --> 00:39:09,288
The Armory, your, uh, highnesses.

639
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:12,331
Well, this is underwhelming.

640
00:39:12,546 --> 00:39:15,554
This is supposed to be full of books.

641
00:39:18,366 --> 00:39:21,941
"Strategies for Trapping
Tomato-eating Garden Fairies."

642
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,934
Yeah, no.

643
00:39:23,981 --> 00:39:25,644
Someone took all the battle magic.

644
00:39:25,691 --> 00:39:28,414
It's not like The Beast
is coming to find us any second.

645
00:39:28,461 --> 00:39:30,382
Wait, this is something.

646
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:33,819
It's an... it's a workbook
on spells, serious ones.

647
00:39:33,866 --> 00:39:35,512
Looks like battle magic.

648
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:37,423
But the actual spells aren't here.

649
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:40,960
Hmm, like notes on cake,
but no actual recipes.

650
00:39:41,007 --> 00:39:43,062
That's helpful.

651
00:39:43,109 --> 00:39:45,822
Who wrote it?

652
00:39:45,869 --> 00:39:47,991
- Oh, my God.
- What?

653
00:39:48,038 --> 00:39:50,472
I know where we need to go.

654
00:39:52,609 --> 00:39:54,409
Brakebills?

655
00:39:58,339 --> 00:40:02,686
Hello?
Mr., uh, Mr...

656
00:40:05,906 --> 00:40:08,226
Fuck!

657
00:40:09,371 --> 00:40:11,246
Can I help you?

658
00:40:11,379 --> 00:40:14,113
Hell, yes, you can.
These don't work.

659
00:40:14,192 --> 00:40:15,808
Well, by all means, request a refund.

660
00:40:15,856 --> 00:40:17,742
Very funny.
You did this on purpose.

661
00:40:17,789 --> 00:40:20,746
Did what? Help an ungrateful
Child of Earth?

662
00:40:20,871 --> 00:40:22,188
Look, I'll pay you
whatever you want, okay?

663
00:40:22,235 --> 00:40:23,414
I'm... I'm serious, okay?

664
00:40:23,461 --> 00:40:24,924
I'm friends
with the kings and queens.

665
00:40:24,971 --> 00:40:26,859
You want to be a duke,
great, I got you...

666
00:40:26,906 --> 00:40:29,220
Actions have consequences, Penny.

667
00:40:29,267 --> 00:40:32,198
Even glib words spoken
in casual arrogance.

668
00:40:32,245 --> 00:40:34,258
It's past time you learned,

669
00:40:34,305 --> 00:40:36,602
especially give the position
you'll occupy soon.

670
00:40:36,649 --> 00:40:37,628
What position?

671
00:40:37,675 --> 00:40:39,539
You know what?
I've done you a service.

672
00:40:39,586 --> 00:40:41,528
No, no, Look, hey, I'm...

673
00:40:41,582 --> 00:40:44,464
I'm sorry, okay?

674
00:40:44,512 --> 00:40:47,731
Please fix my hands.

675
00:40:47,785 --> 00:40:50,783
See, how do I put this
in a way that you'll understand?

676
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:54,504
Ah, go fuck yourself.

677
00:40:54,629 --> 00:40:58,424
No, wait!

678
00:40:58,471 --> 00:41:00,663
Fuck!

679
00:41:03,442 --> 00:41:05,785
Hang on to this while I'm gone.

680
00:41:06,112 --> 00:41:08,160
Oh.

681
00:41:09,238 --> 00:41:10,762
You guys all packed?

682
00:41:10,918 --> 00:41:13,129
Yeah.

683
00:41:14,479 --> 00:41:17,504
El, thank you.

684
00:41:17,567 --> 00:41:19,946
For what?
For, um, taking one for the team

685
00:41:19,993 --> 00:41:22,384
to the tune of the rest of my life?

686
00:41:24,061 --> 00:41:26,853
I'm trying to see this ruling thing

687
00:41:26,907 --> 00:41:28,303
as an adventure.

688
00:41:29,193 --> 00:41:31,988
Apparently we have enemies
to the north and south.

689
00:41:32,081 --> 00:41:36,223
Plus broken infrastructure
and huge magic issues

690
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:38,757
thanks to The Beast
and his Wellspring addiction.

691
00:41:38,874 --> 00:41:41,904
And do you know they don't know
what champagne is here?

692
00:41:43,629 --> 00:41:45,637
I plan on inventing it.

693
00:41:45,879 --> 00:41:47,613
I'd like to be known as...

694
00:41:47,832 --> 00:41:50,129
the Champagne King.

695
00:41:50,554 --> 00:41:52,254
It has a ring to it.

696
00:41:52,387 --> 00:41:53,603
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

697
00:41:53,651 --> 00:41:56,465
I'm really looking forward
to drinking socially,

698
00:41:56,699 --> 00:41:58,760
like the French.

699
00:42:03,965 --> 00:42:07,371
So, uh, in the books,

700
00:42:07,504 --> 00:42:10,137
time doesn't exactly run
the same speed

701
00:42:10,192 --> 00:42:13,591
on Earth as in Fillory.

702
00:42:13,809 --> 00:42:15,200
I mean, look, sometimes it got screwy

703
00:42:15,248 --> 00:42:18,104
when Jane and Martin
would go back and forth.

704
00:42:18,292 --> 00:42:20,683
But not always.

705
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,713
It's gonna be fine.

706
00:42:26,535 --> 00:42:27,970
Yeah.

707
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:29,507
Yeah.

708
00:42:29,731 --> 00:42:32,351
Or I'll just live out my days

709
00:42:32,398 --> 00:42:36,825
waiting for my friends
to return and die alone.

710
00:42:43,066 --> 00:42:46,017
You know, it's considered
extremely disrespectful

711
00:42:46,065 --> 00:42:48,482
to touch a king without permission.

712
00:42:51,543 --> 00:42:54,473
But, um, I think you should...

713
00:42:55,176 --> 00:42:58,231
probably hug me right now.

714
00:43:07,871 --> 00:43:09,465
It'll also be okay if you just

715
00:43:09,598 --> 00:43:12,194
give my ass, like, a little squeeze.

716
00:43:14,988 --> 00:43:19,198
Feel free to, uh, double-check
this before I get started.

717
00:43:19,527 --> 00:43:21,660
Julia?

718
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:35,936
Why do you want to help me

719
00:43:36,671 --> 00:43:38,710
with my Shade?

720
00:43:39,293 --> 00:43:40,668
Without your Shade,

721
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:43,715
you would see
a lot of things differently.

722
00:43:45,574 --> 00:43:48,145
You'd be able to live, Julia.

723
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,077
Come here.

724
00:43:51,202 --> 00:43:53,327
Let me show you.

725
00:44:25,472 --> 00:44:27,871
- We're there.
- Put it back.

726
00:44:27,919 --> 00:44:29,671
It's okay, it's okay.

727
00:44:31,015 --> 00:44:33,171
I need it.

728
00:44:34,467 --> 00:44:37,202
Put it back now, Martin.

729
00:44:38,683 --> 00:44:40,436
Suit yourself.

730
00:45:00,663 --> 00:45:02,772
I understand why you're afraid.

731
00:45:03,928 --> 00:45:06,021
You don't want to lose yourself.

732
00:45:06,186 --> 00:45:08,299
But hear me on this.

733
00:45:08,577 --> 00:45:10,100
Martyring yourself to your pain

734
00:45:10,147 --> 00:45:11,644
isn't all it's advertised to be.

735
00:45:11,691 --> 00:45:13,843
It'll destroy you.

736
00:45:14,929 --> 00:45:17,444
There's no glory in that.

737
00:45:18,327 --> 00:45:20,835
You might get Reynard, yes.

738
00:45:22,405 --> 00:45:24,593
But he'll still win.

739
00:45:25,265 --> 00:45:27,132
Anyways.
