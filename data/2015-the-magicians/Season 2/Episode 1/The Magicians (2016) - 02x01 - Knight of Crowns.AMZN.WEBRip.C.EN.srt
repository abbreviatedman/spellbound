1
00:00:01,117 --> 00:00:02,714
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:02,715 --> 00:00:05,218
We summoned some kind of killer
moth man from another world.

3
00:00:05,289 --> 00:00:06,889
My friends who got separated
and I just...

4
00:00:06,933 --> 00:00:08,399
I can't let them fight
The Beast on their own.

5
00:00:08,434 --> 00:00:10,830
You want me to come to Fillory with you?

6
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,783
All right, so there might be
a solution here, a weapon.

7
00:00:12,818 --> 00:00:14,285
It sounds like, if we could find it,

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,686
we could use it to kill The Beast.

9
00:00:15,721 --> 00:00:17,421
- Payment is due.
- Apparently marriage here

10
00:00:17,456 --> 00:00:19,590
- is different.
- I can never leave Fillory.

11
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:21,558
I have gifted you my Bestowal.

12
00:00:21,594 --> 00:00:23,894
When you are ready to face The Beast,

13
00:00:23,929 --> 00:00:25,129
imbibe it.

14
00:00:25,164 --> 00:00:26,497
We followed all the clues.

15
00:00:26,532 --> 00:00:29,133
We thought
that She was leading us to Her.

16
00:00:29,168 --> 00:00:30,668
We summoned Her.

17
00:00:30,703 --> 00:00:34,004
You know, I actually believed
Our Lady Underground chose me.

18
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:36,173
You may address me as Reynard the Fox,

19
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:39,209
Trickster of the faithful,
the pure of heart,

20
00:00:39,245 --> 00:00:43,147
the very stupid.

21
00:00:43,182 --> 00:00:45,082
Hi, Martin.

22
00:00:52,425 --> 00:00:54,425
Ahh!

23
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,592
Wait.

24
00:00:55,628 --> 00:00:56,794
You know how to deal with gods.

25
00:00:56,829 --> 00:00:59,029
You know how to fuck up their shit.

26
00:00:59,065 --> 00:01:01,432
- I want to make a deal.
- Let's.

27
00:01:23,022 --> 00:01:25,322
Help!

28
00:01:28,227 --> 00:01:31,395
Somebody!

29
00:01:42,408 --> 00:01:43,974
There's gotta be someone

30
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:47,845
in this motherfucking
goddamn magical forest.

31
00:01:49,415 --> 00:01:51,248
Get up.

32
00:01:51,283 --> 00:01:53,317
People are dying.

33
00:02:20,513 --> 00:02:22,379
Hungry, I assume?

34
00:02:22,415 --> 00:02:25,549
After all that being chased?

35
00:02:25,584 --> 00:02:27,117
No, um, I'm not being chased.

36
00:02:27,153 --> 00:02:30,387
Oh. Usually they're being chased.

37
00:02:30,423 --> 00:02:33,857
That I know of, no.

38
00:02:33,893 --> 00:02:37,828
But you do need some kind of help.

39
00:02:37,863 --> 00:02:39,797
Uh, it's just where
I come from there's a legend

40
00:02:39,832 --> 00:02:43,200
about a witch
with a cottage made of candy.

41
00:02:43,235 --> 00:02:44,735
Well, the cottage is mostly wood,

42
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,404
and I'm more of a healer and...

43
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,273
gardening enthusiast.

44
00:02:49,308 --> 00:02:52,484
Okay.

45
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,819
I need your help.

46
00:02:53,854 --> 00:02:56,221
And you're offering...?

47
00:02:56,257 --> 00:02:59,391
- Offering? Um...
- Gold... is always good.

48
00:02:59,426 --> 00:03:01,894
You would be helping
the next High King of Fillory.

49
00:03:01,929 --> 00:03:03,262
Okay.

50
00:03:03,297 --> 00:03:05,164
Then my discount rate.

51
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,365
One vial.

52
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,033
Vial of what?

53
00:03:08,068 --> 00:03:09,535
Were you dropped on your head
as a child?

54
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:13,305
Your blood, dum-dum.

55
00:03:20,548 --> 00:03:23,382
There you are.

56
00:03:23,417 --> 00:03:26,518
We were so worried.

57
00:03:26,554 --> 00:03:28,687
You're, uh...

58
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,195
God-powered.

59
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,565
So it's a little hard
to kill me at the moment.

60
00:03:43,337 --> 00:03:45,070
Ahh!

61
00:03:45,105 --> 00:03:47,639
Thank God.

62
00:03:47,675 --> 00:03:50,576
I mean, you know,

63
00:03:50,611 --> 00:03:53,745
thank God, Alice.

64
00:03:58,619 --> 00:04:00,085
I hesitated.

65
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,787
With The Beast, I should have... it's...

66
00:04:01,822 --> 00:04:02,955
it's my fault.

67
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,156
No, it's not, I...

68
00:04:04,191 --> 00:04:05,457
No, he's right.

69
00:04:05,492 --> 00:04:06,458
It's Julia's fault.

70
00:04:06,493 --> 00:04:07,759
No, guys.

71
00:04:07,795 --> 00:04:10,262
- She... she's not sane.
- You think?

72
00:04:10,297 --> 00:04:11,563
One small consolation

73
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,165
is the bitch is
with The Beast right now,

74
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,133
and I can't really see
that going her way.

75
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:18,637
No, it, uh, I'll explain it in a second.

76
00:04:18,672 --> 00:04:21,440
Um, can I have my blood back, please?

77
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,142
Look, my friends, they're fine.

78
00:04:24,178 --> 00:04:26,812
- I don't need your...
- No.

79
00:04:26,847 --> 00:04:29,948
I took an hour out of my night.

80
00:04:29,984 --> 00:04:32,317
You're in Fillory, Magician.

81
00:04:32,353 --> 00:04:34,486
Be careful with strangers.

82
00:04:34,521 --> 00:04:37,189
We only look whimsical.

83
00:04:40,728 --> 00:04:43,428
- Who was that?
- Uh, a local.

84
00:04:43,464 --> 00:04:46,431
Okay, fuckers, huddle up.

85
00:04:46,467 --> 00:04:48,367
Zillion bucks says The Beast
comes back any minute,

86
00:04:48,402 --> 00:04:49,701
so what's the plan?

87
00:04:49,737 --> 00:04:52,871
We lost the blade,
so we need a new something.

88
00:04:52,907 --> 00:04:55,274
Um, especially while Alice is still...

89
00:04:55,309 --> 00:04:56,942
- Juiced up?
- We should all juice up.

90
00:04:56,977 --> 00:05:00,412
Like The Beast.
Wellspring smoothies, stat.

91
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:13,191
Ahh! Shit.

92
00:05:13,227 --> 00:05:15,527
There's a missing piece right there.

93
00:05:15,562 --> 00:05:17,496
Oh, hey, I think I... uh, yeah.

94
00:05:17,531 --> 00:05:19,798
Ahh!

95
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:21,233
This is going great.

96
00:05:21,268 --> 00:05:23,201
Let me try.

97
00:05:30,778 --> 00:05:33,912
Wow, swallowing has its privileges.

98
00:05:53,968 --> 00:05:56,668
- Wow, it looks like...
- A major drought's hit.

99
00:05:56,704 --> 00:05:58,837
There's a bucket.

100
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:07,412
Shit.

101
00:06:12,252 --> 00:06:14,753
I knew The Beast came here
every day, but is it...

102
00:06:14,788 --> 00:06:16,121
but is it even possible for him

103
00:06:16,156 --> 00:06:17,823
to drain the Wellspring that much?

104
00:06:17,858 --> 00:06:19,358
He really threw something out of whack.

105
00:06:19,393 --> 00:06:21,059
I vote we don't touch it on the grounds

106
00:06:21,095 --> 00:06:22,961
that exploding Fillory wouldn't help.

107
00:06:22,997 --> 00:06:24,262
Okay. We need a new plan.

108
00:06:24,298 --> 00:06:26,198
What plan? The Beast is gone.

109
00:06:26,233 --> 00:06:29,067
Our squad is a joke. What plan, exactly?

110
00:06:29,103 --> 00:06:30,769
We'll figure it out. We always do.

111
00:06:30,804 --> 00:06:32,404
When it's a final to cheat on,

112
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:34,639
not when we're stuck
in some epic fantasy

113
00:06:34,675 --> 00:06:39,411
that likes to behead its heroes
halfway through season one.

114
00:06:39,446 --> 00:06:42,881
If we even are heroes.

115
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:46,051
We might be comic relief.

116
00:06:48,155 --> 00:06:49,955
I thought you threw that out.

117
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:53,025
It's for emergencies. Pass it around.

118
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,895
Okay. No Wellspring, no knife.

119
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,131
I have no idea what to do now.

120
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:01,033
So we are fucked without grease.

121
00:07:01,068 --> 00:07:04,073
- That sounds like us.
- Must be a Monday.

122
00:07:04,872 --> 00:07:06,872
Onward to glory.

123

124
00:07:21,021 --> 00:07:24,156
Ah, much better.

125
00:07:28,862 --> 00:07:30,228
Why are... are we...

126
00:07:30,264 --> 00:07:32,431
Ah, the food is tremendous.

127
00:07:32,466 --> 00:07:35,934
Let's sit.

128
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:39,137
- You familiar?
- Word as bond?

129
00:07:39,173 --> 00:07:42,507
Uh, I assume the extra bits
enchant the blade

130
00:07:42,543 --> 00:07:44,142
to kill me instantly

131
00:07:44,178 --> 00:07:47,779
in the event I break it, eh.

132
00:07:47,815 --> 00:07:49,581
Okay, here's the deal...

133
00:07:49,616 --> 00:07:52,350
You need to kill a god.

134
00:07:52,386 --> 00:07:54,486
Thrilling.

135
00:07:54,521 --> 00:07:56,188
So you need to get near him.

136
00:07:56,223 --> 00:07:59,891
- Tricky.
- Yes, but you can help.

137
00:07:59,927 --> 00:08:01,893
Mm.

138
00:08:01,929 --> 00:08:05,097
His... name is Reynard the Fox.

139
00:08:05,132 --> 00:08:08,400
A trickster of some sorts, yes?

140
00:08:08,435 --> 00:08:10,235
Oh, that will be a challenge.

141
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,370
Well, you don't really have
much choice, do you?

142
00:08:12,406 --> 00:08:16,141
Oh, well aware you have
that stylish little blade.

143
00:08:16,176 --> 00:08:18,143
I sure do.

144
00:08:18,178 --> 00:08:20,779
That reminds me to insist
the terms of our deal

145
00:08:20,814 --> 00:08:23,115
include said blade reverting to me

146
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,617
at the moment of Reynard's demise.

147
00:08:25,652 --> 00:08:27,886
- Agreed?
- Almost.

148
00:08:27,921 --> 00:08:29,754
First, for the duration
of our agreement,

149
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,957
you do not hurt
or act against me in any way.

150
00:08:31,992 --> 00:08:35,393
Mm, fine.

151
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:37,896
Quentin, all of them.

152
00:08:37,931 --> 00:08:40,932
You lay a finger,

153
00:08:40,968 --> 00:08:45,137
this will put this

154
00:08:45,172 --> 00:08:48,807
in the base of your skull.

155
00:08:48,842 --> 00:08:50,308
You're not what I expected.

156
00:08:50,344 --> 00:08:53,778
Once Reynard is dead,
I put the knife down.

157
00:08:53,814 --> 00:08:56,081
Yours to take.

158
00:08:56,116 --> 00:08:58,850
So this Reynard's still out there?

159
00:08:58,886 --> 00:09:00,418
As far as she knows.

160
00:09:00,454 --> 00:09:01,987
Yeah, it's why she needed the knife

161
00:09:02,022 --> 00:09:03,455
and why she needs The Beast.

162
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,657
Okay, I get it now,
but I also have to say

163
00:09:05,692 --> 00:09:08,760
that is the dumbest thing
she could possibly have done.

164
00:09:08,795 --> 00:09:11,229
Like I said, she's not sane right now.

165
00:09:11,265 --> 00:09:12,998
- I wouldn't be.
- So what are we supposed to do?

166
00:09:13,033 --> 00:09:15,066
- Kill The Beast.
- He's right.

167
00:09:15,102 --> 00:09:16,635
You know, it's awful,

168
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,270
but she chose to double-cross us.

169
00:09:18,305 --> 00:09:20,805
Look, I'm pissed too,
but I would like to point out...

170
00:09:20,841 --> 00:09:22,874
Okay, we don't have to take
a vote right this second.

171
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,509
Penny's right. First things first.

172
00:09:24,545 --> 00:09:27,445
We need to make a plan
to deal with The Beast.

173
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:28,947
Eliot!

174
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:30,282
I thought for sure you...

175
00:09:30,317 --> 00:09:33,185
Yeah, me too. Not yet.

176
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,587
Are... are you all right?

177
00:09:35,622 --> 00:09:38,757
Um, I'll... I'll get everyone
something to eat.

178
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:40,926
That would be amazing.

179
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:46,698
I think I like her.

180
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:48,667
I hope I like her.

181
00:09:54,341 --> 00:09:56,942
Um, okay. This might be something.

182
00:09:56,977 --> 00:10:00,612
Um, so there's a-a-a place

183
00:10:00,647 --> 00:10:01,980
called The Armory.

184
00:10:02,015 --> 00:10:04,216
- Weapons?
- Books.

185
00:10:04,251 --> 00:10:07,285
Uh, So Rupert Chatwin,

186
00:10:07,321 --> 00:10:10,121
uh, he realizes that back home,

187
00:10:10,157 --> 00:10:11,423
World War II is still raging

188
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:14,092
and he tells Jane and Martin
that he is going...

189
00:10:14,127 --> 00:10:16,928
he's... he's going to go fight.
Before he does,

190
00:10:16,964 --> 00:10:19,998
uh, he spends all night
in The Armory reading.

191
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:22,867
Uh, and, uh, you know,
like, whatever he finds,

192
00:10:22,903 --> 00:10:25,170
it doesn't say,

193
00:10:25,205 --> 00:10:29,774
but his next move
is to petition Ember and Umber

194
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,276
for strength.

195
00:10:31,311 --> 00:10:33,111
I mean, what...
what if he found something?

196
00:10:33,146 --> 00:10:35,380
What if he found, uh, a spell

197
00:10:35,415 --> 00:10:38,850
or a piece of, I don't know,
Fillorian Battle Magic

198
00:10:38,885 --> 00:10:40,952
that was so strong
that he couldn't do it without...

199
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:42,721
- Without juice?
- Yeah, because the...

200
00:10:42,756 --> 00:10:45,590
okay, the thing is, this is, uh,

201
00:10:45,626 --> 00:10:49,127
December, 1944.

202
00:10:49,162 --> 00:10:50,895
I mean, he shows up
right in the middle of the...

203
00:10:50,931 --> 00:10:54,599
Battle of the Bulge.

204
00:10:54,635 --> 00:10:58,203
Wait, are you saying
that Rupert secretly...

205
00:10:58,238 --> 00:11:00,739
I'm saying, uh...

206
00:11:00,774 --> 00:11:05,143
maybe he found something
powerful enough to help.

207
00:11:05,178 --> 00:11:07,379
And win World War II?

208
00:11:07,414 --> 00:11:10,782
Maybe.

209
00:11:10,817 --> 00:11:13,318
Well then, I need The Armory.
Where is it?

210
00:11:13,353 --> 00:11:16,988
Castle Whitespire. Accessible to...

211
00:11:17,024 --> 00:11:17,989
the King.

212
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:20,325
Oh, hey.

213
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,761
And if we can find
the road, there's, um,

214
00:11:22,796 --> 00:11:25,497
a carriage that runs
in a continuous circle, uh,

215
00:11:25,532 --> 00:11:28,099
also at the disposal of the King, so...

216
00:11:28,135 --> 00:11:31,569
Okay. Whitespire it is.

217
00:11:31,605 --> 00:11:34,806
Come on, everybody. Grab snacks.

218
00:11:34,841 --> 00:11:36,441
Yeah, uh, about that.

219
00:11:36,476 --> 00:11:37,809
My hands are in a fucking box,

220
00:11:37,844 --> 00:11:40,011
so Chatwin's Torrent.

221
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:43,148
I-I know that one.
It's, um, it's a healing river.

222
00:11:43,183 --> 00:11:45,317
- Can it reattach hands?
- Maybe.

223
00:11:45,352 --> 00:11:47,519
I'm going. I'll catch you on the flip.

224
00:11:47,554 --> 00:11:49,421
Wait, no, I don't think
you should be going alone.

225
00:11:49,456 --> 00:11:53,058
I'll go. Um, healing water?

226
00:11:53,093 --> 00:11:56,428
We're going to battle.
I'll grab, like, a gallon.

227
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,767
You're wiping your own ass,
so figure that out.

228
00:12:15,315 --> 00:12:17,716
- Souvenir?
- Barometer.

229
00:12:17,751 --> 00:12:21,686
Thought I should pay attention
to see if it gets warm.

230
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:28,660
Whoa. Hey, guys.

231
00:12:28,695 --> 00:12:30,295
Hey, over here!

232
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,297
Oh, my God,
those horses are so beautiful.

233
00:12:32,332 --> 00:12:34,099
Uh, hey. What are you doing?

234
00:12:34,134 --> 00:12:36,701
- I just really love horses.
- Come on.

235
00:12:36,737 --> 00:12:37,869
Hup!

236
00:12:40,374 --> 00:12:42,741
You have got to be kidding me.

237
00:12:42,776 --> 00:12:44,976
I know, those horses were so rude.

238
00:12:45,011 --> 00:12:46,378
I guess they're a tad literal.

239
00:12:46,413 --> 00:12:48,413
Yeah. I'd call needing to see
an actual crown

240
00:12:48,448 --> 00:12:50,281
on my head as pretty goddamn literal.

241
00:12:50,317 --> 00:12:52,550
Look, it's not just about the carriage.

242
00:12:52,586 --> 00:12:54,419
They're not gonna let us into Whitespire

243
00:12:54,454 --> 00:12:56,421
until you've been crowned
High King, so...

244
00:12:56,456 --> 00:12:59,858
So we... we need to get you crowned.

245
00:12:59,893 --> 00:13:02,527
Uh...

246
00:13:02,562 --> 00:13:04,963
Okay, yeah. Um, so there's a...

247
00:13:04,998 --> 00:13:08,566
there's a specific coronation place

248
00:13:08,602 --> 00:13:10,201
in the forest.

249
00:13:10,237 --> 00:13:11,636
There are four kings and queens.

250
00:13:11,671 --> 00:13:16,374
Yeah, you get to pick the other three.

251
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:17,742
Do I get to be a king?

252
00:13:17,778 --> 00:13:19,744
Unless you want me to pick Penny.

253
00:13:20,981 --> 00:13:23,281
So, okay, so we get
to the coronation spot

254
00:13:23,316 --> 00:13:25,116
by crossing the Rainbow Bridge.

255
00:13:25,152 --> 00:13:28,386
Rainbow Bridge? Like where
family pets go when they die?

256
00:13:28,422 --> 00:13:30,221
No. I mean, not that I know of.

257
00:13:30,257 --> 00:13:32,791
No, it's called that because of
the flowers that are everywhere.

258
00:13:32,826 --> 00:13:35,226
- Oh.
- Um, but there is, of course,

259
00:13:35,262 --> 00:13:36,861
no map,

260
00:13:36,897 --> 00:13:40,298
but I know Martin found it with a spell.

261
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:44,102
Well, we could always just ask around.

262
00:13:44,137 --> 00:13:46,838
Or we could make like Martin.

263
00:14:02,055 --> 00:14:03,655
He loves me.

264
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,089
He loves me not.

265
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:07,592
He loves me.

266
00:14:07,627 --> 00:14:09,561
He loves me not.

267
00:14:09,596 --> 00:14:12,730
Uh, he loves me. Let's go.

268
00:14:24,077 --> 00:14:26,945
Ah.

269
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,148
Uh, please know I heard every loophole.

270
00:14:30,183 --> 00:14:32,784
"Put the knife down."

271
00:14:32,819 --> 00:14:35,653
You really think
you have a fighting chance?

272
00:14:35,689 --> 00:14:38,590
I think I'm gonna give it my best.

273
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:41,626
Oh, this is going to be fun.

274
00:14:43,438 --> 00:14:47,128
Nice of Reynard to pull
so many hearts out of chests.

275
00:14:47,368 --> 00:14:49,016
It's, uh, distinctive.

276
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,906
Why do you suppose he does that?

277
00:14:53,941 --> 00:14:56,742
- He likes the taste.
- Mm.

278
00:14:59,046 --> 00:15:01,680
Brilliant, that, uh, laptop.

279
00:15:01,715 --> 00:15:04,516
The things they come up with
when they don't have magic.

280
00:15:04,552 --> 00:15:07,819
Yeah, like accounts that tweet
police scanner activity.

281
00:15:07,855 --> 00:15:09,154
"Tweet"?

282
00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:12,658
Birds have computer accounts?

283
00:15:12,693 --> 00:15:14,826
Don't worry about it.

284
00:15:14,862 --> 00:15:18,297
- Mm.
- Wait a minute.

285
00:15:18,332 --> 00:15:21,567
They found five bodies
at a house in Florida.

286
00:15:21,602 --> 00:15:23,402
Missing a couple of hearts.

287
00:15:27,007 --> 00:15:31,410
Okay, just try to keep people
away for a minute.

288
00:15:32,513 --> 00:15:35,614
- Nicely.
- Mm-hmm.

289
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:39,017
Hey, is this seat taken?

290
00:15:45,025 --> 00:15:46,065
Excuse me, sir, this is...

291
00:15:46,093 --> 00:15:48,226
Won't be but a moment.

292
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:21,360
He's still in Richard's body.

293
00:16:21,395 --> 00:16:24,496
Richard doesn't care, darling.

294
00:16:24,531 --> 00:16:26,465
I fucking do.

295
00:16:29,103 --> 00:16:31,737
Well, so I guess we came for not much.

296
00:16:31,772 --> 00:16:35,140
On the contrary, we've
verified what attracts Reynard.

297
00:16:35,175 --> 00:16:36,675
What? Witches doing rituals?

298
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,644
I mean, that's thousands
of people every day.

299
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:41,613
Not this type of ritual.

300
00:16:44,785 --> 00:16:46,451
Come on.

301
00:16:55,529 --> 00:16:58,764
So, what do I do?

302
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:00,799
Well, per the books,

303
00:17:00,834 --> 00:17:04,503
you strip and jump in, I guess.

304
00:17:04,538 --> 00:17:06,304
Here, I'll help you.

305
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,807
You'll need to help him
sew those back on his wrists.

306
00:17:08,842 --> 00:17:11,410
- Who are you?
- I watch the river.

307
00:17:11,445 --> 00:17:14,579
And assist those who require its magic.

308
00:17:17,718 --> 00:17:19,651
This guy is fucking weird.

309
00:17:27,494 --> 00:17:29,294
Go on.

310
00:17:37,871 --> 00:17:40,005
Go. Go, go.

311
00:17:48,382 --> 00:17:50,849
You know, you're very beautiful.

312
00:17:50,884 --> 00:17:52,718
Where are you from, hmm?

313
00:17:52,753 --> 00:17:53,952
Earth?

314
00:17:53,987 --> 00:17:56,955
Love women from Earth.

315
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:59,124
Is it supposed to take this long?

316
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:02,260
No. He may have drowned.

317
00:18:02,296 --> 00:18:04,029
Are you kidding? Why didn't you...

318
00:18:04,064 --> 00:18:08,033
Oh, oh, oh. There we go.

319
00:18:08,068 --> 00:18:10,335
Are you sure I can't interest
you in an elixir?

320
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,270
It... it's small batch and very fresh.

321
00:18:12,306 --> 00:18:14,940
- No, thank you.
- I have a tooth powder

322
00:18:14,975 --> 00:18:16,641
that I think you are going to love.

323
00:18:16,677 --> 00:18:19,077
You know what? We're kinda in a hurry.

324
00:18:19,113 --> 00:18:21,480
I understand. As you wish.

325
00:18:21,515 --> 00:18:23,448
Pleasure to serve.

326
00:18:25,686 --> 00:18:26,818
I think he wants a tip.

327
00:18:26,854 --> 00:18:28,820
20 gold pieces is customary.

328
00:18:28,856 --> 00:18:30,422
Okay, that sounds like a lot.

329
00:18:30,457 --> 00:18:31,790
Well, this is Chatwin's Torrent.

330
00:18:31,825 --> 00:18:33,992
We don't have... there was nothing

331
00:18:34,027 --> 00:18:35,594
about charging in the books.

332
00:18:35,629 --> 00:18:38,063
Oh, uh, you'd rather pay in labor?

333
00:18:38,098 --> 00:18:39,498
I think three to five years.

334
00:18:39,533 --> 00:18:41,533
Are you fucking kidding me?

335
00:18:41,568 --> 00:18:44,002
You said none of this
before I went in the river.

336
00:18:44,037 --> 00:18:45,504
Because I have manners...

337
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:48,106
Are you even officially
affiliated with the Torrent?

338
00:18:48,142 --> 00:18:50,675
- Penny, chill out.
- It's kind of an amateur calling.

339
00:18:50,711 --> 00:18:52,677
Oh, I see. Yes, yes, you're a con man.

340
00:18:52,713 --> 00:18:55,647
- No, Penny...
- No, I know his type.

341
00:18:55,682 --> 00:18:57,616
I've been ripped off plenty of times

342
00:18:57,651 --> 00:19:01,353
by smiling little snake oil
pricks like this dude.

343
00:19:01,388 --> 00:19:02,921
- Okay, all right.
- Same in Detroit,

344
00:19:02,956 --> 00:19:05,657
same in Mumbai, same in Fillory.

345
00:19:05,692 --> 00:19:07,793
- Okay.
- Sorry, try it on the next sap

346
00:19:07,828 --> 00:19:12,697
who needs this natural resource
on public property.

347
00:19:12,733 --> 00:19:14,299
Good luck.

348
00:19:14,334 --> 00:19:17,202
I'm sorry. He gets touchy.

349
00:19:17,237 --> 00:19:19,337
It's... it's not personal.

350
00:19:19,373 --> 00:19:22,541
Um, these are diamond.

351
00:19:22,576 --> 00:19:25,844
- What the hell is diamond?
- Here.

352
00:19:25,879 --> 00:19:28,647
When you meet one scammer,
you met 'em all. Let's go.

353
00:19:28,682 --> 00:19:30,615
Okay.

354
00:19:43,262 --> 00:19:46,263
Okay, so this net... this net you throw,

355
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:47,798
what sort of a net catches a god?

356
00:19:47,834 --> 00:19:49,333
Oh, it's an obscure bit of casting,

357
00:19:49,368 --> 00:19:51,202
but I assure you it works.

358
00:19:51,237 --> 00:19:53,904
We'll just have to act fast
when the time comes.

359
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,340
It'll hold for a few seconds.

360
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:59,276
So...

361
00:19:59,312 --> 00:20:01,412
I need a few items.

362
00:20:05,985 --> 00:20:09,053
Okay, it might be better for
me to go alone for some of this.

363
00:20:09,088 --> 00:20:11,388
Uh, can you drop me at the playground?

364
00:20:11,424 --> 00:20:13,424
I like to watch
the little children play.

365
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:16,093
It's perfectly innocent.

366
00:20:31,377 --> 00:20:34,145
Al, we got your note.

367
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,614
Let's do this.

368
00:20:36,649 --> 00:20:38,382
I call High Queen.

369
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:40,417
Did it work?

370
00:20:40,453 --> 00:20:42,853
Perfect. Lead the way.

371
00:20:53,466 --> 00:20:56,200
It's fine. They're just healing.

372
00:21:46,819 --> 00:21:49,720
Do you think he's sleeping or dead?

373
00:21:49,755 --> 00:21:51,655
I don't know, should we just
go into the trunk?

374
00:21:51,691 --> 00:21:54,558
Oh, pussies.

375
00:21:54,594 --> 00:21:57,695
- He looks dead.
- I guess we're late.

376
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:06,203
Oh, dear.

377
00:22:08,407 --> 00:22:12,543
Oh, dear.

378
00:22:17,984 --> 00:22:20,851
I am the Knight of Crowns.

379
00:22:20,887 --> 00:22:23,287
Uh, my apologies.

380
00:22:23,322 --> 00:22:27,958
I seem to have died waiting
for you aspirants to come.

381
00:22:27,994 --> 00:22:31,996
Y-y-you are aspirants?

382
00:22:32,031 --> 00:22:33,697
Uh...

383
00:22:33,733 --> 00:22:36,467
I'm the High King of Fillory.

384
00:22:36,502 --> 00:22:37,801
I took a blood test.

385
00:22:37,837 --> 00:22:42,640
Excellent, excellent. It's an honor.

386
00:22:42,675 --> 00:22:44,942
Can we have the crowns, please?

387
00:22:44,977 --> 00:22:47,211
Certainly. Honored to oblige.

388
00:22:47,246 --> 00:22:50,481
Just as soon as you pass the test.

389
00:22:50,516 --> 00:22:52,683
Of course there's a test.

390
00:22:52,718 --> 00:22:56,654
As you know, only a Child Of Earth

391
00:22:56,689 --> 00:23:00,324
can wear the crown of the High King.

392
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:02,426
I will ask you a series of questions

393
00:23:02,461 --> 00:23:05,162
designed to root out
all pretenders to the throne.

394
00:23:05,197 --> 00:23:08,165
Only a true High King
will hold the answers

395
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,334
in his heart.

396
00:23:12,772 --> 00:23:16,140
Come at me.

397
00:23:16,175 --> 00:23:20,277
What popular American television program

398
00:23:20,313 --> 00:23:23,247
stars actor Tim Daly?

399
00:23:23,282 --> 00:23:24,682
What the fuck?

400
00:23:24,717 --> 00:23:26,617
He was in a lot of TV shows.

401
00:23:26,652 --> 00:23:28,452
There is only one correct answer.

402
00:23:28,487 --> 00:23:30,321
Okay. Give me the next question.

403
00:23:30,356 --> 00:23:34,825
This hit single
is performed by offspring

404
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,560
of famous entertainers.

405
00:23:36,595 --> 00:23:39,330
Dude, that is crazy vague.

406
00:23:39,365 --> 00:23:41,532
You will receive a single hint.

407
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:44,435
Your hint is Beach Boys.

408
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:47,871
"Hold On" by Wilson Phillips.

409
00:23:47,907 --> 00:23:49,540
That song is my jam.

410
00:23:49,575 --> 00:23:52,443
Wait, all these questions
are from the '90s.

411
00:23:52,478 --> 00:23:55,212
It... it's not the 1990s
on Earth right now?

412
00:23:55,247 --> 00:23:57,014
No, it... it's 2017.

413
00:23:57,049 --> 00:24:00,951
Oh, and it's, uh, "Wings,"
the... the Tim Daly show. "Wings."

414
00:24:00,987 --> 00:24:05,289
- Of course you know that.
- Okay, '90s.

415
00:24:05,324 --> 00:24:07,895
Ask me something about Patrick Swayze.

416
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,853
You know of Swayze?

417
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,757
Ahem.

418
00:24:22,308 --> 00:24:23,907
"Sorry about the disruption, folks,

419
00:24:23,943 --> 00:24:26,844
"but I always do the last dance
of the season.

420
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:28,779
"This year somebody told me not to.

421
00:24:28,814 --> 00:24:30,981
"So I'm gonna do my kind of dancing

422
00:24:31,017 --> 00:24:32,549
"with a great partner,

423
00:24:32,585 --> 00:24:35,152
"who's not only a terrific dancer.

424
00:24:35,187 --> 00:24:37,921
"Somebody who's taught me

425
00:24:37,957 --> 00:24:39,923
"that there are people out there
willing to stand up

426
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:43,494
"for other people
no matter what it costs them.

427
00:24:43,529 --> 00:24:47,698
"Somebody who's taught me

428
00:24:47,733 --> 00:24:51,435
"about the kind of person I want to be.

429
00:24:51,641 --> 00:24:53,374
Miss Frances Houseman."

430
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:57,209
Oh, Your Majesty.

431
00:24:57,782 --> 00:25:01,217
The crowns of Fillory are yours.

432
00:25:17,062 --> 00:25:19,028
So I guess we just put them on.

433
00:25:19,064 --> 00:25:20,396
No, God, stop.

434
00:25:20,432 --> 00:25:24,467
I mean, I just...
we should do a-a ceremony.

435
00:25:24,502 --> 00:25:26,436
This is only gonna happen once.

436
00:25:26,471 --> 00:25:28,317
We are becoming kings and queens,

437
00:25:28,342 --> 00:25:33,200
so... it's important
and we should honor it.

438
00:25:34,212 --> 00:25:36,643
Just give me that.

439
00:25:38,617 --> 00:25:41,517
Kneel, Eliot Waugh.

440
00:25:41,553 --> 00:25:44,921
Would you just do it?
It's gonna be quick, I promise.

441
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:53,896
So, destiny is... it's bullshit.

442
00:25:53,932 --> 00:25:56,866
But you are High King in your blood.

443
00:25:56,901 --> 00:25:58,968
And somehow that makes sense, you know?

444
00:25:59,004 --> 00:26:00,970
And I-I just... for what it's worth,

445
00:26:01,006 --> 00:26:04,774
I think that you are going to be
a really good king.

446
00:26:04,809 --> 00:26:09,646
Um, so, um, I-I dub thee,

447
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:12,015
um, I don't know.

448
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:14,417
Would you say, like,
you're more brave or merciful?

449
00:26:14,452 --> 00:26:17,020
I'd say I'm neither.

450
00:26:17,055 --> 00:26:20,523
But I still plan to be
a spectacular monarch.

451
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:22,992
I hereby dub thee

452
00:26:23,028 --> 00:26:25,928
High King Eliot

453
00:26:25,964 --> 00:26:28,498
the Spectacular.

454
00:26:31,936 --> 00:26:35,905
Wow, uh,

455
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:39,075
this feels as natural as underwear.

456
00:26:43,348 --> 00:26:46,783
Thank you.

457
00:26:46,818 --> 00:26:49,585
By the power vested in me by...

458
00:26:49,621 --> 00:26:52,722
I have no idea,

459
00:26:52,757 --> 00:26:56,025
I do hereby crown you

460
00:26:56,061 --> 00:26:59,662
High Queen Margo

461
00:26:59,698 --> 00:27:01,064
the Destroyer.

462
00:27:01,099 --> 00:27:02,899
I mean that in the best possible sense.

463
00:27:02,934 --> 00:27:07,403
Uh, all hail. Everyone clap.

464
00:27:11,976 --> 00:27:15,611
I have known what you truly are

465
00:27:15,647 --> 00:27:18,548
since the day we met.

466
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:20,717
Long may you reign.

467
00:27:30,528 --> 00:27:32,995
I feel it's incumbent upon me

468
00:27:33,031 --> 00:27:37,533
to promise never again
to betray you like I did.

469
00:27:37,569 --> 00:27:42,138
I really... really am sorry.

470
00:27:42,173 --> 00:27:46,709
I have some character defects.
I'm working on it.

471
00:27:46,745 --> 00:27:48,878
Honestly.

472
00:27:55,653 --> 00:27:58,521
I'm working on some too.

473
00:27:58,556 --> 00:28:00,923
Well, on that note,

474
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:05,094
I crown you Queen Alice

475
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:06,863
the Wise.

476
00:28:16,608 --> 00:28:18,741
No, wait.

477
00:28:18,777 --> 00:28:21,911
Since we're cleaning slates
and shit, give me.

478
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:28,718
Q.

479
00:28:28,753 --> 00:28:32,889
Uh, I could start
by saying something cruel

480
00:28:32,924 --> 00:28:35,691
yet totally hilarious about you.

481
00:28:35,727 --> 00:28:40,329
Let's be real, you're an easy target.

482
00:28:40,365 --> 00:28:42,098
But that's...

483
00:28:42,133 --> 00:28:45,635
well, that's because you're
honest about what you love.

484
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:48,204
And underneath it all, that's...

485
00:28:48,239 --> 00:28:50,640
inspiring.

486
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:54,310
And I'm sorry too.

487
00:28:54,345 --> 00:28:55,711
Not about the sex,

488
00:28:55,747 --> 00:28:58,514
I don't even really remember it.

489
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:01,918
Mostly my part in fucking up
something that was good for you.

490
00:29:01,953 --> 00:29:05,321
Thanks, I think
I fucked it up just fine myself.

491
00:29:05,356 --> 00:29:07,623
Now that we're ruling
a kingdom together,

492
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:10,059
I hope we can be whatever we were again.

493
00:29:10,094 --> 00:29:12,762
I guess you could call that friends.

494
00:29:12,797 --> 00:29:15,031
Let's go with that.

495
00:29:15,066 --> 00:29:18,734
I hereby crown you King Quentin

496
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:23,940
the Moderately Socially Maladjusted.

497
00:29:23,975 --> 00:29:27,109
- Scrunch down.
- Yeah.

498
00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:40,323
Royalty, bitches.

499
00:29:51,703 --> 00:29:53,836
Okay.

500
00:29:59,277 --> 00:30:02,345
Shit.

501
00:30:05,016 --> 00:30:06,582
Hey, everything okay?

502
00:30:06,618 --> 00:30:07,783
I'm going back to the Torrent.

503
00:30:07,819 --> 00:30:09,652
You think that guy did something to you

504
00:30:09,687 --> 00:30:11,787
'cause you were a raging douche?

505
00:30:11,823 --> 00:30:13,422
I'll sweet-talk him.

506
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:16,025
Get him to fix my hands, then...
then I'll head to the castle.

507
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,194
Everything's under control.

508
00:30:31,943 --> 00:30:35,077
Alice.

509
00:30:37,148 --> 00:30:40,216
Apology accepted.

510
00:30:40,251 --> 00:30:44,687
That was you apologizing
for what you did.

511
00:30:44,722 --> 00:30:46,422
I just...

512
00:30:46,457 --> 00:30:49,892
if we survive this,
I hope we can be friends still.

513
00:30:53,031 --> 00:30:56,399
I know it may sound stupid,

514
00:30:56,434 --> 00:30:58,968
but that's what I'm mad at you for,

515
00:30:59,003 --> 00:31:02,538
not... not the cheating part.

516
00:31:02,574 --> 00:31:08,144
The part where what you did
made me lose you.

517
00:31:08,179 --> 00:31:10,246
And you're a big part
of my life, Quentin.

518
00:31:10,281 --> 00:31:14,483
You can never lose me, Alice.

519
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:16,552
I mean, you can avoid me,
you can hate me...

520
00:31:16,588 --> 00:31:18,854
I don't hate you.

521
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:21,657
Well, you can't lose me.

522
00:31:21,693 --> 00:31:23,826
Sorry.

523
00:31:27,398 --> 00:31:32,201
I just... I can't stop thinking.

524
00:31:32,236 --> 00:31:34,971
We're gonna find this epic spell, great.

525
00:31:35,006 --> 00:31:39,342
But I'm afraid I'm just gonna...

526
00:31:39,377 --> 00:31:41,444
freeze again when The Beast
is in front of me.

527
00:31:41,479 --> 00:31:44,180
You're thinking about it wrong.

528
00:31:44,215 --> 00:31:45,655
Cool under pressure is not a talent.

529
00:31:45,683 --> 00:31:47,950
It's a... it's a skill,
and you need to practice.

530
00:31:47,986 --> 00:31:52,321
You... come on.

531
00:31:52,357 --> 00:31:54,557
We stood on a roof together
during the Trials,

532
00:31:54,592 --> 00:31:55,958
and you told me that you were
afraid to see

533
00:31:55,994 --> 00:31:59,795
what you're really capable of.

534
00:31:59,831 --> 00:32:03,099
That was then.

535
00:32:03,134 --> 00:32:05,801
So let's see what you can do now.

536
00:32:05,837 --> 00:32:07,937
I'm not sure it'll help.

537
00:32:07,972 --> 00:32:09,972
Then do it for me. I'm not gonna lie.

538
00:32:10,008 --> 00:32:13,409
I...I'm dying to see what you can do.

539
00:32:16,247 --> 00:32:18,080
I'm not a Naturalist.

540
00:32:18,116 --> 00:32:19,715
You know the spell, we all do.

541
00:32:19,751 --> 00:32:21,884
We just sucked at it.

542
00:32:25,957 --> 00:32:28,090
Let's see what you can do now.

543
00:32:40,905 --> 00:32:45,808
Oh. That feels...

544
00:32:45,843 --> 00:32:50,012
it's just like breathing.

545
00:32:50,048 --> 00:32:53,182
See? Nice.

546
00:33:20,138 --> 00:33:22,138
So how do you feel now?

547
00:33:40,327 --> 00:33:42,419
We're not getting back together.

548
00:33:42,444 --> 00:33:44,644
Okay.

549
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,427
I've been wondering something.

550
00:34:00,462 --> 00:34:03,230
Why didn't Reynard kill you
with your friends?

551
00:34:03,265 --> 00:34:05,198
Why were you spared?

552
00:34:15,578 --> 00:34:17,344
You weren't spared, were you?

553
00:34:17,379 --> 00:34:19,513
Look, let's not go there, okay?

554
00:34:19,548 --> 00:34:21,782
You know, when I was a boy,

555
00:34:21,817 --> 00:34:24,084
a man who was meant to care for me

556
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:27,254
bent me over his desk
and had me over and over

557
00:34:27,289 --> 00:34:29,990
every time I was alone with him.

558
00:34:30,025 --> 00:34:32,693
It helps me understand a truth.

559
00:34:32,728 --> 00:34:36,229
You're powerful or you're weak.

560
00:34:36,265 --> 00:34:40,033
If you're powerful, you will survive.

561
00:34:40,069 --> 00:34:42,869
So what, you're suggesting
I just get over it?

562
00:34:42,905 --> 00:34:45,038
Actually, yes.

563
00:34:47,843 --> 00:34:51,378
How? Mutate?

564
00:34:51,413 --> 00:34:52,613
Take over a world,

565
00:34:52,648 --> 00:34:54,147
kill a bunch of grad students 39 times?

566
00:34:54,183 --> 00:34:58,619
Eh, see, what you feel,

567
00:34:58,654 --> 00:35:00,754
the haunted look in your eyes,

568
00:35:00,789 --> 00:35:05,392
doesn't come from nowhere.

569
00:35:05,427 --> 00:35:07,661
Then where does it come from?

570
00:35:07,696 --> 00:35:09,496
In the center of your being,

571
00:35:09,531 --> 00:35:13,700
there's a tiny beating heart.

572
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,802
What, you mean like my soul?

573
00:35:15,838 --> 00:35:18,405
Part of it, yes, the slimmest part,

574
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,541
but it holds specific power.

575
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:23,710
It's called a Shade.

576
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:26,179
Shade.

577
00:35:26,215 --> 00:35:28,315
It's what makes you feel

578
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:32,386
the pain will burn you
till there's nothing.

579
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,721
And, yes, it's also there for love,

580
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:36,556
but, uh, let's be frank, darling,

581
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:38,625
you're more likely
to throw yourself off a bridge

582
00:35:38,661 --> 00:35:43,530
than ever love again.

583
00:35:43,565 --> 00:35:46,166
I felt that way.

584
00:35:46,201 --> 00:35:50,270
And I knew it crippled me
when I needed to be strong.

585
00:35:50,305 --> 00:35:52,239
As you do now.

586
00:35:58,981 --> 00:36:01,114
You know...

587
00:36:04,353 --> 00:36:07,688
I don't care for people, as a rule.

588
00:36:14,196 --> 00:36:16,997
I like you.

589
00:36:17,032 --> 00:36:18,398
You have promise.

590
00:36:18,434 --> 00:36:22,969
With the right control,
you would be formidable.

591
00:36:23,005 --> 00:36:27,474
Even a worthy collaborator.

592
00:36:27,509 --> 00:36:30,844
I have plans. You could be part of them.

593
00:36:33,615 --> 00:36:35,849
- If?
- Do what I did.

594
00:36:35,884 --> 00:36:38,952
Sever your shade.

595
00:36:38,987 --> 00:36:42,155
- Sever.
- It's not hard.

596
00:36:42,191 --> 00:36:45,058
You'll feel better.

597
00:36:45,094 --> 00:36:47,661
You'll feel happy.

598
00:36:47,696 --> 00:36:49,830
I can show you how.

599
00:36:52,367 --> 00:36:55,135
No, thank you.

600
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:58,305
Do let me know if you change your mind.

601
00:37:50,292 --> 00:37:51,992
Eliot!

602
00:37:52,027 --> 00:37:54,461
The crown suits you, of course.

603
00:37:54,496 --> 00:37:56,663
- Who are all these people?
- The Pickwick family.

604
00:37:56,698 --> 00:37:59,299
They've been running things
till Children of Earth came.

605
00:38:02,371 --> 00:38:03,436
Your Highness.

606
00:38:03,472 --> 00:38:05,238
Tick Pickwick
of the Northern Marsh Pickwicks,

607
00:38:05,274 --> 00:38:06,506
at your service.

608
00:38:06,542 --> 00:38:08,809
The rest of the King's Council
will arrive shortly.

609
00:38:08,844 --> 00:38:11,845
- Great.
- So glad you're here.

610
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,814
There are a few problems.

611
00:38:13,849 --> 00:38:15,715
Uh, several problems

612
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,217
that could use your immediate attention.

613
00:38:17,252 --> 00:38:19,920
Ah, okay, great.
We should probably get started.

614
00:38:19,955 --> 00:38:22,155
First, your throne room.

615
00:38:22,191 --> 00:38:23,723
I'm afraid it's been locked a long time.

616
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,425
- We're looking for the key.
- That's fine.

617
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:28,595
Uh, take me straight to the Armory.

618
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:10,070
The Armory, your, uh, highnesses.

619
00:39:10,105 --> 00:39:12,239
Well, this is underwhelming.

620
00:39:12,274 --> 00:39:15,408
This is supposed to be full of books.

621
00:39:18,247 --> 00:39:21,848
"Strategies for Trapping
Tomato-eating Garden Fairies."

622
00:39:21,884 --> 00:39:23,884
Yeah, no.

623
00:39:23,919 --> 00:39:25,552
Someone took all the battle magic.

624
00:39:25,587 --> 00:39:28,321
It's not like The Beast
is coming to find us any second.

625
00:39:28,357 --> 00:39:30,457
Wait, this is something.

626
00:39:30,492 --> 00:39:33,727
It's an... it's a workbook
on spells, serious ones.

627
00:39:33,762 --> 00:39:35,462
Looks like battle magic.

628
00:39:35,497 --> 00:39:37,330
But the actual spells aren't here.

629
00:39:37,366 --> 00:39:40,867
Hmm, like notes on cake,
but no actual recipes.

630
00:39:40,903 --> 00:39:42,969
That's helpful.

631
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:45,772
Who wrote it?

632
00:39:45,807 --> 00:39:47,941
- Oh, my God.
- What?

633
00:39:47,976 --> 00:39:50,110
I know where we need to go.

634
00:39:52,547 --> 00:39:54,047
Brakebills?

635
00:39:58,335 --> 00:40:02,095
Hello? Mr., uh, Mr....

636
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:09,340
Fuck!

637
00:40:09,376 --> 00:40:11,843
Can I help you?

638
00:40:11,878 --> 00:40:14,128
Hell, yes, you can. These don't work.

639
00:40:14,248 --> 00:40:15,688
Well, by all means, request a refund.

640
00:40:15,716 --> 00:40:17,950
Very funny. You did this on purpose.

641
00:40:17,985 --> 00:40:20,919
Did what? Help an ungrateful
Child of Earth?

642
00:40:20,955 --> 00:40:22,396
Look, I'll pay you
whatever you want, okay?

643
00:40:22,431 --> 00:40:23,664
I'm... I'm serious, okay?

644
00:40:23,699 --> 00:40:25,132
I'm friends with the kings and queens.

645
00:40:25,167 --> 00:40:27,067
You want to be a duke,
great, I got you...

646
00:40:27,102 --> 00:40:29,469
Actions have consequences, Penny.

647
00:40:29,505 --> 00:40:32,406
Even glib words spoken
in casual arrogance.

648
00:40:32,441 --> 00:40:34,508
It's past time you learned,

649
00:40:34,543 --> 00:40:36,810
especially give the position
you'll occupy soon.

650
00:40:36,845 --> 00:40:37,878
What position?

651
00:40:37,913 --> 00:40:39,746
You know what? I've done you a service.

652
00:40:39,782 --> 00:40:41,848
No, no, Look, hey, I'm...

653
00:40:41,884 --> 00:40:44,518
I'm sorry, okay?

654
00:40:44,553 --> 00:40:47,688
Please fix my hands.

655
00:40:47,723 --> 00:40:50,991
See, how do I put this
in a way that you'll understand?

656
00:40:51,026 --> 00:40:54,995
Ah, go fuck yourself.

657
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:58,632
No, wait!

658
00:40:58,667 --> 00:41:00,601
Fuck!

659
00:41:03,505 --> 00:41:06,273
Hang on to this while I'm gone.

660
00:41:06,308 --> 00:41:09,076
Oh.

661
00:41:09,111 --> 00:41:10,877
You guys all packed?

662
00:41:10,913 --> 00:41:14,681
Yeah.

663
00:41:14,717 --> 00:41:17,451
El, thank you.

664
00:41:17,486 --> 00:41:20,153
For what?
For, um, taking one for the team

665
00:41:20,189 --> 00:41:22,322
to the tune of the rest of my life?

666
00:41:24,026 --> 00:41:27,060
I'm trying to see this ruling thing

667
00:41:27,096 --> 00:41:29,396
as an adventure.

668
00:41:29,431 --> 00:41:31,999
Apparently we have enemies
to the north and south.

669
00:41:32,034 --> 00:41:36,103
Plus broken infrastructure
and huge magic issues

670
00:41:36,138 --> 00:41:38,939
thanks to The Beast
and his Wellspring addiction.

671
00:41:38,974 --> 00:41:41,842
And do you know they don't know
what champagne is here?

672
00:41:43,579 --> 00:41:45,712
I plan on inventing it.

673
00:41:45,748 --> 00:41:47,581
I'd like to be known as...

674
00:41:47,616 --> 00:41:51,118
the Champagne King.

675
00:41:51,153 --> 00:41:52,286
It has a ring to it.

676
00:41:52,321 --> 00:41:53,854
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

677
00:41:53,889 --> 00:41:56,957
I'm really looking forward
to drinking socially,

678
00:41:56,992 --> 00:41:58,925
like the French.

679
00:42:04,033 --> 00:42:07,567
So, uh, in the books,

680
00:42:07,603 --> 00:42:10,170
time doesn't exactly run the same speed

681
00:42:10,205 --> 00:42:13,840
on Earth as in Fillory.

682
00:42:13,876 --> 00:42:15,409
I mean, look, sometimes it got screwy

683
00:42:15,444 --> 00:42:18,312
when Jane and Martin
would go back and forth.

684
00:42:18,347 --> 00:42:20,480
But not always.

685
00:42:22,518 --> 00:42:24,651
It's gonna be fine.

686
00:42:26,722 --> 00:42:28,322
Yeah.

687
00:42:28,357 --> 00:42:29,756
Yeah.

688
00:42:29,792 --> 00:42:32,559
Or I'll just live out my days

689
00:42:32,594 --> 00:42:36,763
waiting for my friends
to return and die alone.

690
00:42:42,938 --> 00:42:46,006
You know, it's considered
extremely disrespectful

691
00:42:46,041 --> 00:42:49,376
to touch a king without permission.

692
00:42:51,647 --> 00:42:55,449
But, um, I think you should...

693
00:42:55,484 --> 00:42:58,618
probably hug me right now.

694
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:09,529
It'll also be okay if you just

695
00:43:09,565 --> 00:43:12,132
give my ass, like, a little squeeze.

696
00:43:14,937 --> 00:43:19,406
Feel free to, uh, double-check
this before I get started.

697
00:43:19,441 --> 00:43:21,575
Julia?

698
00:43:33,489 --> 00:43:36,423
Why do you want to help me

699
00:43:36,458 --> 00:43:39,292
with my Shade?

700
00:43:39,328 --> 00:43:40,794
Without your Shade,

701
00:43:40,829 --> 00:43:45,465
you would see
a lot of things differently.

702
00:43:45,501 --> 00:43:49,302
You'd be able to live, Julia.

703
00:43:49,338 --> 00:43:51,338
Come here.

704
00:43:51,373 --> 00:43:53,507
Let me show you.

705
00:44:25,641 --> 00:44:27,774
- We're there.
- Put it back.

706
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:31,278
It's okay, it's okay.

707
00:44:31,313 --> 00:44:34,347
I need it.

708
00:44:34,383 --> 00:44:37,517
Put it back now, Martin.

709
00:44:38,921 --> 00:44:41,188
Suit yourself.

710
00:45:00,642 --> 00:45:03,777
I understand why you're afraid.

711
00:45:03,812 --> 00:45:06,313
You don't want to lose yourself.

712
00:45:06,348 --> 00:45:08,548
But hear me on this.

713
00:45:08,584 --> 00:45:10,350
Martyring yourself to your pain

714
00:45:10,385 --> 00:45:11,852
isn't all it's advertised to be.

715
00:45:11,887 --> 00:45:14,888
