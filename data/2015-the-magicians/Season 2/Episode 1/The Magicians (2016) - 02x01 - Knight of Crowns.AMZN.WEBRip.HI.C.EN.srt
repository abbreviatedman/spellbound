00:09:00,454 --> 00:09:01,987
Yeah, it's why she needed the knife

184
00:09:02,022 --> 00:09:03,455
and why she needs The Beast.

185
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,657
Okay, I get it now,
but I also have to say

186
00:09:05,692 --> 00:09:08,760
that is the dumbest thing
she could possibly have done.

187
00:09:08,795 --> 00:09:11,229
Like I said, she's not sane right now.

188
00:09:11,265 --> 00:09:12,998
- I wouldn't be.
- So what are we supposed to do?

189
00:09:13,033 --> 00:09:15,066
- Kill The Beast.
- He's right.

190
00:09:15,102 --> 00:09:16,635
You know, it's awful,

191
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,270
but she chose to double-cross us.

192
00:09:18,305 --> 00:09:20,805
Look, I'm pissed too,
but I would like to point out...

193
00:09:20,841 --> 00:09:22,874
Okay, we don't have to take
a vote right this second.

194
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,509
Penny's right. First things first.

195
00:09:24,545 --> 00:09:27,445
We need to make a plan
to deal with The Beast.

196
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:28,947
Eliot!

197
00:09:28,982 --> 00:09:30,282
I thought for sure you...

198
00:09:30,317 --> 00:09:33,185
Yeah, me too. Not yet.

199
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,587
Are... are you all right?

200
00:09:35,622 --> 00:09:38,757
Um, I'll... I'll get everyone
something to eat.

201
00:09:38,792 --> 00:09:40,926
That would be amazing.

202
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:46,698
I think I like her.

203
00:09:46,733 --> 00:09:48,667
I hope I like her.

204
00:09:54,341 --> 00:09:56,942
Um, okay. This might be something.

205
00:09:56,977 --> 00:10:00,612
Um, so there's a-a-a place

206
00:10:00,647 --> 00:10:01,980
called The Armory.

207
00:10:02,015 --> 00:10:04,216
- Weapons?
- Books.

208
00:10:04,251 --> 00:10:07,285
Uh, So Rupert Chatwin,

209
00:10:07,321 --> 00:10:10,121
uh, he realizes that back home,

210
00:10:10,157 --> 00:10:11,423
World War II is still raging

211
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:14,092
and he tells Jane and Martin
that he is going...

212
00:10:14,127 --> 00:10:16,928
he's... he's going to go fight.
Before he does,

213
00:10:16,964 --> 00:10:19,998
uh, he spends all night
in The Armory reading.

214
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:22,867
Uh, and, uh, you know,
like, whatever he finds,

215
00:10:22,903 --> 00:10:25,170
it doesn't say,

216
00:10:25,205 --> 00:10:29,774
but his next move
is to petition Ember and Umber

217
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,276
for strength.

218
00:10:31,311 --> 00:10:33,111
I mean, what...
what if he found something?

219
00:10:33,146 --> 00:10:35,380
What if he found, uh, a spell

220
00:10:35,415 --> 00:10:38,850
or a piece of, I don't know,
Fillorian Battle Magic

221
00:10:38,885 --> 00:10:40,952
that was so strong
that he couldn't do it without...

222
00:10:40,988 --> 00:10:42,721
- Without juice?
- Yeah, because the...

223
00:10:42,756 --> 00:10:45,590
okay, the thing is, this is, uh,

224
00:10:45,626 --> 00:10:49,127
December, 1944.

225
00:10:49,162 --> 00:10:50,895
I mean, he shows up
right in the middle of the...

226
00:10:50,931 --> 00:10:54,599
Battle of the Bulge.

227
00:10:54,635 --> 00:10:58,203
Wait, are you saying
that Rupert secretly...

228
00:10:58,238 --> 00:11:00,739
I'm saying, uh...

229
00:11:00,774 --> 00:11:05,143
maybe he found something
powerful enough to help.

230
00:11:05,178 --> 00:11:07,379
And win World War II?

231
00:11:07,414 --> 00:11:10,782
Maybe.

232
00:11:10,817 --> 00:11:13,318
Well then, I need The Armory.
Where is it?

233
00:11:13,353 --> 00:11:16,988
Castle Whitespire. Accessible to...

234
00:11:17,024 --> 00:11:17,989
the King.

235
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:20,325
Oh, hey.

236
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,761
And if we can find
the road, there's, um,

237
00:11:22,796 --> 00:11:25,497
a carriage that runs
in a continuous circle, uh,

238
00:11:25,532 --> 00:11:28,099
also at the disposal of the King, so...

239
00:11:28,135 --> 00:11:31,569
Okay. Whitespire it is.

240
00:11:31,605 --> 00:11:34,806
Come on, everybody. Grab snacks.

241
00:11:34,841 --> 00:11:36,441
Yeah, uh, about that.

242
00:11:36,476 --> 00:11:37,809
My hands are in a fucking box,

243
00:11:37,844 --> 00:11:40,011
so Chatwin's Torrent.

244
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:43,148
I-I know that one.
It's, um, it's a healing river.

245
00:11:43,183 --> 00:11:45,317
- Can it reattach hands?
- Maybe.

246
00:11:45,352 --> 00:11:47,519
I'm going. I'll catch you on the flip.

247
00:11:47,554 --> 00:11:49,421
Wait, no, I don't think
you should be going alone.

248
00:11:49,456 --> 00:11:53,058
I'll go. Um, healing water?

249
00:11:53,093 --> 00:11:56,428
We're going to battle.
I'll grab, like, a gallon.

250
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,767
You're wiping your own ass,
so figure that out.

251
00:12:15,315 --> 00:12:17,716
- Souvenir?
- Barometer.

252
00:12:17,751 --> 00:12:21,686
Thought I should pay attention
to see if it gets warm.

those horses are so beautiful.

Hup!

260
00:12:40,374 --> 00:12:42,741
You have got to be kidding me.

261
00:12:42,776 --> 00:12:44,976
I know, those horses were so rude.

262
00:12:45,011 --> 00:12:46,378
I guess they're a tad literal.

263
00:12:46,413 --> 00:12:48,413
Yeah. I'd call needing to see
an actual crown

264
00:12:48,448 --> 00:12:50,281
on my head as pretty goddamn literal.

265
00:12:50,317 --> 00:12:52,550
Look, it's not just about the carriage.

266
00:12:52,586 --> 00:12:54,419
They're not gonna let us into Whitespire

267
00:12:54,454 --> 00:12:56,421
until you've been crowned
High King, so...

268
00:12:56,456 --> 00:12:59,858
So we... we need to get you crowned.

269
00:12:59,893 --> 00:13:02,527
Uh...

270
00:13:02,562 --> 00:13:04,963
Okay, yeah. Um, so there's a...

271
00:13:04,998 --> 00:13:08,566
there's a specific coronation place

272
00:13:08,602 --> 00:13:10,201
in the forest.

273
00:13:10,237 --> 00:13:11,636
There are four kings and queens.

274
00:13:11,671 --> 00:13:16,374
Yeah, you get to pick the other three.

275
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:17,742
Do I get to be a king?

276
00:13:17,778 --> 00:13:19,744
Unless you want me to pick Penny.

277
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,945
[chuckles]

278
00:13:20,981 --> 00:13:23,281
So, okay, so we get
to the coronation spot

279
00:13:23,316 --> 00:13:25,116
by crossing the Rainbow Bridge.

280
00:13:25,152 --> 00:13:28,386
Rainbow Bridge? Like where
family pets go when they die?

281
00:13:28,422 --> 00:13:30,221
No. I mean, not that I know of.

282
00:13:30,257 --> 00:13:32,791
No, it's called that because of
the flowers that are everywhere.

283
00:13:32,826 --> 00:13:35,226
- Oh.
- Um, but there is, of course,

284
00:13:35,262 --> 00:13:36,861
no map,

285
00:13:36,897 --> 00:13:40,298
but I know Martin found it with a spell.

286
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:44,102
Well, we could always just ask around.

287
00:13:44,137 --> 00:13:46,838

so many hearts out of chests.

- Mm.

00:18:28,856 --> 00:18:30,422
Okay, that sounds like a lot.

360
00:18:30,457 --> 00:18:31,790
Well, this is Chatwin's Torrent.

361
00:18:31,825 --> 00:18:33,992
We don't have... there was nothing

362
00:18:34,027 --> 00:18:35,594
about charging in the books.

363
00:18:35,629 --> 00:18:38,063
Oh, uh, you'd rather pay in labor?

364
00:18:38,098 --> 00:18:39,498
I think three to five years.

365
00:18:39,533 --> 00:18:41,533
Are you fucking kidding me?

366
00:18:41,568 --> 00:18:44,002
You said none of this
before I went in the river.

367
00:18:44,037 --> 00:18:45,504
Because I have manners...

368
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:48,106
Are you even officially
affiliated with the Torrent?

369
00:18:48,142 --> 00:18:50,675
- Penny, chill out.
- It's kind of an amateur calling.

370
00:18:50,711 --> 00:18:52,677
Oh, I see. Yes, yes, you're a con man.

371
00:18:52,713 --> 00:18:55,647
- No, Penny...
- No, I know his type.

372
00:18:55,682 --> 00:18:57,616
I've been ripped off plenty of times

373
00:18:57,651 --> 00:19:01,353
by smiling little snake oil
pricks like this dude.

374
00:19:01,388 --> 00:19:02,921
- Okay, all right.
- Same in Detroit,

375
00:19:02,956 --> 00:19:05,657
same in Mumbai, same in Fillory.

376
00:19:05,692 --> 00:19:07,793
- Okay.
- Sorry, try it on the next sap

377
00:19:07,828 --> 00:19:12,697
who needs this natural resource
on public property.

378
00:19:12,733 --> 00:19:14,299
Good luck.

379
00:19:14,334 --> 00:19:17,202
I'm sorry. He gets touchy.

380
00:19:17,237 --> 00:19:19,337
It's... it's not personal.

381
00:19:19,373 --> 00:19:22,541
Um, these are diamond.

382
00:19:22,576 --> 00:19:25,844
- What the hell is diamond?
- Here.

383
00:19:25,879 --> 00:19:28,647
When you meet one scammer,
you met 'em all. Let's go.

384
00:19:28,682 --> 00:19:30,615
Okay.

385
00:19:32,553 --> 00:19:35,520
<i>[soft music]</i>

386
00:19:43,262 --> 00:19:46,263
Okay, so this net... this net you throw,

387
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:47,798
what sort of a net catches a god?

388
00:19:47,834 --> 00:19:49,333
Oh, it's an obscure bit of casting,

389
00:19:49,368 --> 00:19:51,202
but I assure you it works.

390
00:19:51,237 --> 00:19:53,904
We'll just have to act fast
when the time comes.

391
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,340
It'll hold for a few seconds.

392
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:59,276
So...

393
00:19:59,312 --> 00:20:01,412
I need a few items.

394
00:20:05,985 --> 00:20:09,053
Okay, it might be better for
me to go alone for some of this.

395
00:20:09,088 --> 00:20:11,388
Uh, can you drop me at the playground?

396
00:20:11,424 --> 00:20:13,424
I like to watch
the little children play.

397
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:16,093
It's perfectly innocent.

398
00:20:16,129 --> 00:20:18,295
[humming]

399
00:20:31,377 --> 00:20:34,145
Al, we got your note.

400
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,614
Let's do this.

401
00:20:36,649 --> 00:20:38,382
I call High Queen.

402
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:40,417
- [chuckles]
- Did it work?

403
00:20:40,453 --> 00:20:42,853
Perfect. Lead the way.

404
00:20:53,466 --> 00:20:56,200
It's fine. They're just healing.

405

I don't know, should we just
go into the trunk?

Oh, pussies.

420
00:21:54,594 --> 00:21:57,695
- He looks dead.
- I guess we're late.

421
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:00,664
[coughing]

422
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:06,203
Oh, dear.

423
00:22:08,407 --> 00:22:12,543
Oh, dear. [grunts]

424
00:22:17,984 --> 00:22:20,851
I am the Knight of Crowns.

425
00:22:20,887 --> 00:22:23,287
Uh, my apologies.

426
00:22:23,322 --> 00:22:27,958
I seem to have died waiting
for you aspirants to come.

427
00:22:27,994 --> 00:22:31,996
Y-y-you are aspirants?

428
00:22:32,031 --> 00:22:33,697
Uh... [clears throat]

429
00:22:33,733 --> 00:22:36,467
I'm the High King of Fillory.

430
00:22:36,502 --> 00:22:37,801
I took a blood test.

431
00:22:37,837 --> 00:22:42,640
Excellent, excellent. It's an honor.

432
00:22:42,675 --> 00:22:44,942
Can we have the crowns, please?

433
00:22:44,977 --> 00:22:47,211
Certainly. Honored to oblige.

434
00:22:47,246 --> 00:22:50,481
Just as soon as you pass the test.

435
00:22:50,516 --> 00:22:52,683
Of course there's a test.

436
00:22:52,718 --> 00:22:56,654
As you know, only a Child Of Earth

437
00:22:56,689 --> 00:23:00,324
can wear the crown of the High King.

438
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:02,426
I will ask you a series of questions

439
00:23:02,461 --> 00:23:05,162
designed to root out
all pretenders to the throne.

440
00:23:05,197 --> 00:23:08,165
Only a true High King
will hold the answers

441
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,334
in his heart.

442
00:23:12,772 --> 00:23:16,140
Come at me.

443
00:23:16,175 --> 00:23:20,277
What popular American television program

444
00:23:20,313 --> 00:23:23,247
stars actor Tim Daly?

445
00:23:23,282 --> 00:23:24,682
What the fuck?

446
00:23:24,717 --> 00:23:26,617
He was in a lot of TV shows.

447
00:23:26,652 --> 00:23:28,452
There is only one correct answer.

448
00:23:28,487 --> 00:23:30,321
Okay. Give me the next question.

449
00:23:30,356 --> 00:23:34,825
This hit single
is performed by offspring

450
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,560
of famous entertainers.

451
00:23:36,595 --> 00:23:39,330
Dude, that is crazy vague.

452
00:23:39,365 --> 00:23:41,532
You will receive a single hint.

453
00:23:41,567 --> 00:23:44,435
Your hint is Beach Boys.

454
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:47,871
Both: "Hold On" by Wilson Phillips.

455
00:23:47,907 --> 00:23:49,540
That song is my jam.

456
00:23:49,575 --> 00:23:52,443
Wait, all these questions
are from the '90s.

457
00:23:52,478 --> 00:23:55,212
It... it's not the 1990s
on Earth right now?

458
00:23:55,247 --> 00:23:57,014
No, it... it's 2017.

459
00:23:57,049 --> 00:24:00,951
Oh, and it's, uh, "Wings,"
the... the Tim Daly show. "Wings."

460
00:24:00,987 --> 00:24:05,289
- Of course you know that.
- Okay, '90s.

461
00:24:05,324 --> 00:24:07,895
Ask me something about Patrick Swayze.

462
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,853
You know of Swayze?

463
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,757
Ahem.

464
00:24:19,782 --> 00:24:22,179
[exhales sharply]

465
00:24:22,308 --> 00:24:23,907
"Sorry about the disruption, folks,

466
00:24:23,943 --> 00:24:26,844
"but I always do the last dance
of the season.

467
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:28,779
"This year somebody told me not to.

468
00:24:28,814 --> 00:24:30,981
"So I'm gonna do my kind of dancing

469
00:24:31,017 --> 00:24:32,549
"with a great partner,

470
00:24:32,585 --> 00:24:35,152
"who's not only a terrific dancer.

471
00:24:35,187 --> 00:24:37,921
"Somebody who's taught me

472
00:24:37,957 --> 00:24:39,923
"that there are people out there
willing to stand up

473
00:24:39,959 --> 00:24:43,494
"for other people
no matter what it costs them.

474
00:24:43,529 --> 00:24:47,698
"Somebody who's taught me

475
00:24:47,733 --> 00:24:51,435
"about the kind of person I want to be.

476
00:24:51,641 --> 00:24:53,374
Miss Frances Houseman."

477
00:24:53,541 --> 00:24:57,209
Oh, Your Majesty.

478
00:24:57,782 --> 00:25:01,217
The crowns of Fillory are yours.

479
00:25:17,062 --> 00:25:19,028
So I guess we just put them on.

480
00:25:19,064 --> 00:25:20,396
No, God, stop.

481
00:25:20,432 --> 00:25:24,467
I mean, I just...
we should do a-a ceremony.

482
00:25:24,502 --> 00:25:26,436
This is only gonna happen once.

483
00:25:26,471 --> 00:25:28,317
We are becoming kings and queens,

484
00:25:28,342 --> 00:25:33,200
so... it's important
and we should honor it.

485
00:25:34,212 --> 00:25:36,643
Just give me that.

486
00:25:38,617 --> 00:25:41,517
Kneel, Eliot Waugh.

487
00:25:41,553 --> 00:25:44,921
Would you just do it?
It's gonna be quick, I promise.

488
00:25:51,029 --> 00:25:53,896
So, destiny is... it's bullshit.

489
00:25:53,932 --> 00:25:56,866
But you are High King in your blood.

490
00:25:56,901 --> 00:25:58,968
And somehow that makes sense, you know?

491
00:25:59,004 --> 00:26:00,970
And I-I just... for what it's worth,

492
00:26:01,006 --> 00:26:04,774
I think that you are going to be
a really good king.

493
00:26:04,809 --> 00:26:09,646
Um, so, um, I-I dub thee,

494
00:26:09,681 --> 00:26:12,015
um, I don't know.

495
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:14,417
Would you say, like,
you're more brave or merciful?

496
00:26:14,452 --> 00:26:17,020
I'd say I'm neither.

497
00:26:17,055 --> 00:26:20,523
But I still plan to be
a spectacular monarch.

498
00:26:20,558 --> 00:26:22,992
I hereby dub thee

499
00:26:23,028 --> 00:26:25,928
High King Eliot

500
00:26:25,964 --> 00:26:28,498
the Spectacular.

501
00:26:31,936 --> 00:26:35,905
Wow, uh,

502
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:39,075
this feels as natural as underwear.

503
00:26:43,348 --> 00:26:46,783
Thank you.

504
00:26:46,818 --> 00:26:49,585
By the power vested in me by...

505
00:26:49,621 --> 00:26:52,722
I have no idea,

506
00:26:52,757 --> 00:26:56,025
I do hereby crown you

507
00:26:56,061 --> 00:26:59,662
High Queen Margo

508
00:26:59,698 --> 00:27:01,064
the Destroyer.

509
00:27:01,099 --> 00:27:02,899
I mean that in the best possible sense.

510
00:27:02,934 --> 00:27:07,403
Uh, all hail. Everyone clap.

511
00:27:07,439 --> 00:27:09,572
[applause]

512
00:27:11,976 --> 00:27:15,611
I have known what you truly are

513
00:27:15,647 --> 00:27:18,548
since the day we met.

514
00:27:18,583 --> 00:27:20,717
Long may you reign.

515
00:27:30,528 --> 00:27:32,995
I feel it's incumbent upon me

516
00:27:33,031 --> 00:27:37,533
to promise never again
to betray you like I did.

517
00:27:37,569 --> 00:27:42,138
I really... really am sorry.

518
00:27:42,173 --> 00:27:46,709
I have some character defects.
I'm working on it.

519
00:27:46,745 --> 00:27:48,878
Honestly.

520
00:27:55,653 --> 00:27:58,521
I'm working on some too.

521
00:27:58,556 --> 00:28:00,923
Well, on that note,

522
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:05,094
I crown you Queen Alice

523
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:06,863
the Wise.

524
00:28:16,608 --> 00:28:18,741
No, wait.

525
00:28:18,777 --> 00:28:21,911
Since we're cleaning slates
and shit, give me.

526
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:28,718
Q.

527
00:28:28,753 --> 00:28:32,889
Uh, I could start
by saying something cruel

528
00:28:32,924 --> 00:28:35,691
yet totally hilarious about you.

529
00:28:35,727 --> 00:28:40,329
Let's be real, you're an easy target.

530
00:28:40,365 --> 00:28:42,098
But that's...

531
00:28:42,133 --> 00:28:45,635
well, that's because you're
honest about what you love.

532
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:48,204
And underneath it all, that's...

533
00:28:48,239 --> 00:28:50,640
inspiring.

534
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:54,310
And I'm sorry too.

535
00:28:54,345 --> 00:28:55,711
Not about the sex,

536
00:28:55,747 --> 00:28:58,514
I don't even really remember it.

537
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:01,918
Mostly my part in fucking up
something that was good for you.

538
00:29:01,953 --> 00:29:05,321
Thanks, I think
I fucked it up just fine myself.

539
00:29:05,356 --> 00:29:07,623
Now that we're ruling
a kingdom together,

540
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:10,059
I hope we can be whatever we were again.

541
00:29:10,094 --> 00:29:12,762
I guess you could call that friends.

542
00:29:12,797 --> 00:29:15,031
Let's go with that.

543
00:29:15,066 --> 00:29:18,734
I hereby crown you King Quentin

544
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:23,940
the Moderately Socially Maladjusted.

545
00:29:23,975 --> 00:29:27,109
- Scrunch down.
- Yeah.

546
00:29:33,218 --> 00:29:36,152
[applause]

547
00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:40,323
Royalty, bitches.

548
00:29:51,703 --> 00:29:53,836
Okay.

549
00:29:59,277 --> 00:30:02,345
Shit.
[grunts]

550
00:30:05,016 --> 00:30:06,582
Hey, everything okay?

551
00:30:06,618 --> 00:30:07,783
I'm going back to the Torrent.

552
00:30:07,819 --> 00:30:09,652
You think that guy did something to you

553
00:30:09,687 --> 00:30:11,787
'cause you were a raging douche?

554
00:30:11,823 --> 00:30:13,422
I'll sweet-talk him.

555
00:30:13,458 --> 00:30:16,025
Get him to fix my hands, then...
then I'll head to the castle.

556
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,194
Everything's under control.

557
00:30:31,943 --> 00:30:35,077
[coughs] Alice.

558
00:30:37,148 --> 00:30:40,216
Apology accepted.

559
00:30:40,251 --> 00:30:44,687
That was you apologizing
for what you did.

560
00:30:44,722 --> 00:30:46,422
I just...

561
00:30:46,457 --> 00:30:49,892
if we survive this,
I hope we can be friends still.

562
00:30:53,031 --> 00:30:56,399
I know it may sound stupid,

563
00:30:56,434 --> 00:30:58,968
but that's what I'm mad at you for,

564
00:30:59,003 --> 00:31:02,538
not... not the cheating part.

565
00:31:02,574 --> 00:31:08,144
The part where what you did
made me lose you.

566
00:31:08,179 --> 00:31:10,246
And you're a big part
of my life, Quentin.

567
00:31:10,281 --> 00:31:14,483
You can never lose me, Alice.

568
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:16,552
I mean, you can avoid me,
you can hate me...

569
00:31:16,588 --> 00:31:18,854
I don't hate you.

570
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:21,657
Well, you can't lose me.

571
00:31:21,693 --> 00:31:23,826
Sorry.

572
00:31:27,398 --> 00:31:32,201
I just... I can't stop thinking.

573
00:31:32,236 --> 00:31:34,971
We're gonna find this epic spell, great.

574
00:31:35,006 --> 00:31:39,342
But I'm afraid I'm just gonna...

575
00:31:39,377 --> 00:31:41,444
freeze again when The Beast
is in front of me.

576
00:31:41,479 --> 00:31:44,180
You're thinking about it wrong.

577
00:31:44,215 --> 00:31:45,655
Cool under pressure is not a talent.

578
00:31:45,683 --> 00:31:47,950
It's a... it's a skill,
and you need to practice.

579
00:31:47,986 --> 00:31:52,321
You... come on.

580
00:31:52,357 --> 00:31:54,557
We stood on a roof together
during the Trials,

581
00:31:54,592 --> 00:31:55,958
and you told me that you were
afraid to see

582
00:31:55,994 --> 00:31:59,795
what you're really capable of.

583
00:31:59,831 --> 00:32:03,099
[scoffs]
That was then.

584
00:32:03,134 --> 00:32:05,801
So let's see what you can do now.

585
00:32:05,837 --> 00:32:07,937
I'm not sure it'll help.

586
00:32:07,972 --> 00:32:09,972
Then do it for me. I'm not gonna lie.

587
00:32:10,008 --> 00:32:13,409
I...I'm dying to see what you can do.

588
00:32:16,247 --> 00:32:18,080
I'm not a Naturalist.

589
00:32:18,116 --> 00:32:19,715
You know the spell, we all do.

590
00:32:19,751 --> 00:32:21,884
We just sucked at it.

591
00:32:25,957 --> 00:32:28,090
Let's see what you can do now.

592
00:32:40,905 --> 00:32:45,808
Oh. That feels...

593
00:32:45,843 --> 00:32:50,012
it's just like breathing.

594
00:32:50,048 --> 00:32:53,182
See? Nice.

595
00:33:18,342 --> 00:33:19,966
[chuckles]

596
00:33:20,138 --> 00:33:22,138
So how do you feel now?

597
00:33:40,327 --> 00:33:42,419
We're not getting back together.

598
00:33:42,444 --> 00:33:44,644
Okay.

599
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,427
I've been wondering something.

600
00:34:00,462 --> 00:34:03,230
Why didn't Reynard kill you
with your friends?

601
00:34:03,265 --> 00:34:05,198
Why were you spared?

602
00:34:15,578 --> 00:34:17,344
You weren't spared, were you?

603
00:34:17,379 --> 00:34:19,513
Look, let's not go there, okay?

604
00:34:19,548 --> 00:34:21,782
You know, when I was a boy,

605
00:34:21,817 --> 00:34:24,084
a man who was meant to care for me

606
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:27,254
bent me over his desk
and had me over and over

607
00:34:27,289 --> 00:34:29,990
every time I was alone with him.

608
00:34:30,025 --> 00:34:32,693
It helps me understand a truth.

609
00:34:32,728 --> 00:34:36,229
You're powerful or you're weak.

610
00:34:36,265 --> 00:34:40,033
If you're powerful, you will survive.

611
00:34:40,069 --> 00:34:42,869
So what, you're suggesting
I just get over it?

612
00:34:42,905 --> 00:34:45,038
Actually, yes.

613
00:34:47,843 --> 00:34:51,378
How? Mutate?

614
00:34:51,413 --> 00:34:52,613
Take over a world,

615
00:34:52,648 --> 00:34:54,147
kill a bunch of grad students 39 times?

616
00:34:54,183 --> 00:34:58,619
[chuckles] Eh, see, what you feel,

617
00:34:58,654 --> 00:35:00,754
the haunted look in your eyes,

618
00:35:00,789 --> 00:35:05,392
doesn't come from nowhere.

619
00:35:05,427 --> 00:35:07,661
Then where does it come from?

620
00:35:07,696 --> 00:35:09,496
In the center of your being,

621
00:35:09,531 --> 00:35:13,700
there's a tiny beating heart.

622
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,802
What, you mean like my soul?

623
00:35:15,838 --> 00:35:18,405
Part of it, yes, the slimmest part,

624
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,541
but it holds specific power.

625
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:23,710
It's called a Shade.

626
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:26,179
Shade.

627
00:35:26,215 --> 00:35:28,315
It's what makes you feel

628
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:32,386
the pain will burn you
till there's nothing.

629
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,721
And, yes, it's also there for love,

630
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:36,556
but, uh, let's be frank, darling,

631
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:38,625
you're more likely
to throw yourself off a bridge

632
00:35:38,661 --> 00:35:43,530
than ever love again.

633
00:35:43,565 --> 00:35:46,166
I felt that way.

634
00:35:46,201 --> 00:35:50,270
And I knew it crippled me
when I needed to be strong.

635
00:35:50,305 --> 00:35:52,239
As you do now.

636
00:35:58,981 --> 00:36:01,114
You know...

637
00:36:04,353 --> 00:36:07,688
I don't care for people, as a rule.

638
00:36:14,196 --> 00:36:16,997
I like you.

639
00:36:17,032 --> 00:36:18,398
You have promise.

640
00:36:18,434 --> 00:36:22,969
With the right control,
you would be formidable.

641
00:36:23,005 --> 00:36:27,474
Even a worthy collaborator.

642
00:36:27,509 --> 00:36:30,844
I have plans. You could be part of them.

643
00:36:33,615 --> 00:36:35,849
- If?
- Do what I did.

644
00:36:35,884 --> 00:36:38,952
Sever your shade.

645
00:36:38,987 --> 00:36:42,155
- Sever.
- It's not hard.

646
00:36:42,191 --> 00:36:45,058
You'll feel better.

647
00:36:45,094 --> 00:36:47,661
You'll feel happy.

648
00:36:47,696 --> 00:36:49,830
I can show you how.

649
00:36:52,367 --> 00:36:55,135
No, thank you.

650
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:58,305
Do let me know if you change your mind.

651
00:37:04,346 --> 00:37:07,280
[humming]

652
00:37:12,354 --> 00:37:15,355
<i>[soft music]</i>

653
00:37:44,419 --> 00:37:47,354
[indistinct chatter]

654
00:37:50,292 --> 00:37:51,992
Eliot!

655
00:37:52,027 --> 00:37:54,461
The crown suits you, of course.

656
00:37:54,496 --> 00:37:56,663
- Who are all these people?
- The Pickwick family.

657
00:37:56,698 --> 00:37:59,299
They've been running things
till Children of Earth came.

658
00:38:02,371 --> 00:38:03,436
Your Highness.

659
00:38:03,472 --> 00:38:05,238
Tick Pickwick
of the Northern Marsh Pickwicks,

660
00:38:05,274 --> 00:38:06,506
at your service.

661
00:38:06,542 --> 00:38:08,809
The rest of the King's Council
will arrive shortly.

662
00:38:08,844 --> 00:38:11,845
- Great.
- So glad you're here.

663
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,814
There are a few problems.

664
00:38:13,849 --> 00:38:15,715
Uh, several problems

665
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,217
that could use your immediate attention.

666
00:38:17,252 --> 00:38:19,920
Ah, okay, great.
We should probably get started.

667
00:38:19,955 --> 00:38:22,155
First, your throne room.

668
00:38:22,191 --> 00:38:23,723
I'm afraid it's been locked a long time.

669
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,425
- We're looking for the key.
- That's fine.

670
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:28,595
Uh, take me straight to the Armory.

671
00:38:31,433 --> 00:38:34,367
[laughing]

672
00:38:39,141 --> 00:38:40,974
[laughing]

673
00:38:41,009 --> 00:38:43,143
[gasps]

674
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:10,070
The Armory, your, uh, highnesses.

675
00:39:10,105 --> 00:39:12,239
Well, this is underwhelming.

676
00:39:12,274 --> 00:39:15,408
This is supposed to be full of books.

677
00:39:18,247 --> 00:39:21,848
"Strategies for Trapping
Tomato-eating Garden Fairies."

678
00:39:21,884 --> 00:39:23,884
Yeah, no.

679
00:39:23,919 --> 00:39:25,552
Someone took all the battle magic.

680
00:39:25,587 --> 00:39:28,321
It's not like The Beast
is coming to find us any second.

681
00:39:28,357 --> 00:39:30,457
Wait, this is something.

682
00:39:30,492 --> 00:39:33,727
It's an... it's a workbook
on spells, serious ones.

683
00:39:33,762 --> 00:39:35,462
Looks like battle magic.

684
00:39:35,497 --> 00:39:37,330
But the actual spells aren't here.

685
00:39:37,366 --> 00:39:40,867
Hmm, like notes on cake,
but no actual recipes.

686
00:39:40,903 --> 00:39:42,969
That's helpful.

687
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:45,772
Who wrote it?

688
00:39:45,807 --> 00:39:47,941
- Oh, my God.
- What?

689
00:39:47,976 --> 00:39:50,110
I know where we need to go.

690
00:39:52,547 --> 00:39:54,047
Brakebills?

691
00:39:58,335 --> 00:40:02,095
Hello? Mr., uh, Mr....

692
00:40:02,335 --> 00:40:05,804
[grunting]

693
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:09,340
Fuck!

694
00:40:09,376 --> 00:40:11,843
Can I help you?

695
00:40:11,878 --> 00:40:14,128
Hell, yes, you can. These don't work.

696
00:40:14,248 --> 00:40:15,688
Well, by all means, request a refund.

697
00:40:15,716 --> 00:40:17,950
Very funny. You did this on purpose.

698
00:40:17,985 --> 00:40:20,919
Did what? Help an ungrateful
Child of Earth?

699
00:40:20,955 --> 00:40:22,396
Look, I'll pay you
whatever you want, okay?

700
00:40:22,431 --> 00:40:23,664
I'm... I'm serious, okay?

701
00:40:23,699 --> 00:40:25,132
I'm friends with the kings and queens.

702
00:40:25,167 --> 00:40:27,067
You want to be a duke,
great, I got you...

703
00:40:27,102 --> 00:40:29,469
Actions have consequences, Penny.

704
00:40:29,505 --> 00:40:32,406
Even glib words spoken
in casual arrogance.

705
00:40:32,441 --> 00:40:34,508
It's past time you learned,

706
00:40:34,543 --> 00:40:36,810
especially give the position
you'll occupy soon.

707
00:40:36,845 --> 00:40:37,878
What position?

708
00:40:37,913 --> 00:40:39,746
You know what? I've done you a service.

709
00:40:39,782 --> 00:40:41,848
No, no, Look, hey, I'm...

710
00:40:41,884 --> 00:40:44,518
I'm sorry, okay?

711
00:40:44,553 --> 00:40:47,688
Please fix my hands.

712
00:40:47,723 --> 00:40:50,991
See, how do I put this
in a way that you'll understand?

713
00:40:51,026 --> 00:40:54,995
Ah, go fuck yourself.

714
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:58,632
No, wait!

715
00:40:58,667 --> 00:41:00,601
Fuck!

716
00:41:03,505 --> 00:41:06,273
Hang on to this while I'm gone.

717
00:41:06,308 --> 00:41:09,076
Oh.

718
00:41:09,111 --> 00:41:10,877
You guys all packed?

719
00:41:10,913 --> 00:41:14,681
Yeah.

720
00:41:14,717 --> 00:41:17,451
El, thank you.

721
00:41:17,486 --> 00:41:20,153
For what?
For, um, taking one for the team

722
00:41:20,189 --> 00:41:22,322
to the tune of the rest of my life?

723
00:41:24,026 --> 00:41:27,060
[exhales deeply] I'm trying
to see this ruling thing

724
00:41:27,096 --> 00:41:29,396
as an adventure.

725
00:41:29,431 --> 00:41:31,999
Apparently we have enemies
to the north and south.

726
00:41:32,034 --> 00:41:36,103
Plus broken infrastructure
and huge magic issues

727
00:41:36,138 --> 00:41:38,939
thanks to The Beast
and his Wellspring addiction.

728
00:41:38,974 --> 00:41:41,842
And do you know they don't know
what champagne is here?

729
00:41:43,579 --> 00:41:45,712
I plan on inventing it.

730
00:41:45,748 --> 00:41:47,581
I'd like to be known as...

731
00:41:47,616 --> 00:41:51,118
the Champagne King.

732
00:41:51,153 --> 00:41:52,286
It has a ring to it.

733
00:41:52,321 --> 00:41:53,854
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

734
00:41:53,889 --> 00:41:56,957
I'm really looking forward
to drinking socially,

735
00:41:56,992 --> 00:41:58,925
like the French.

736
00:42:04,033 --> 00:42:07,567
So, uh, in the books,

737
00:42:07,603 --> 00:42:10,170
time doesn't exactly run the same speed

738
00:42:10,205 --> 00:42:13,840
on Earth as in Fillory.

739
00:42:13,876 --> 00:42:15,409
I mean, look, sometimes it got screwy

740
00:42:15,444 --> 00:42:18,312
when Jane and Martin
would go back and forth.

741
00:42:18,347 --> 00:42:20,480
But not always.

742
00:42:22,518 --> 00:42:24,651
It's gonna be fine.

743
00:42:26,722 --> 00:42:28,322
Yeah.

744
00:42:28,357 --> 00:42:29,756
Yeah.

745
00:42:29,792 --> 00:42:32,559
Or I'll just live out my days

746
00:42:32,594 --> 00:42:36,763
waiting for my friends
to return and die alone.

747
00:42:42,938 --> 00:42:46,006
You know, it's considered
extremely disrespectful

748
00:42:46,041 --> 00:42:49,376
to touch a king without permission.

749
00:42:51,647 --> 00:42:55,449
But, um, I think you should...

750
00:42:55,484 --> 00:42:58,618
probably hug me right now.

751
00:43:03,859 --> 00:43:05,792
[exhales deeply]

752
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:09,529
It'll also be okay if you just

753
00:43:09,565 --> 00:43:12,132
give my ass, like, a little squeeze.

754
00:43:12,167 --> 00:43:14,901
[laughter]

755
00:43:14,937 --> 00:43:19,406
Feel free to, uh, double-check
this before I get started.

756
00:43:19,441 --> 00:43:21,575
Julia?

757
00:43:33,489 --> 00:43:36,423
Why do you want to help me

758
00:43:36,458 --> 00:43:39,292
with my Shade?

759
00:43:39,328 --> 00:43:40,794
Without your Shade,

760
00:43:40,829 --> 00:43:45,465
you would see
a lot of things differently.

761
00:43:45,501 --> 00:43:49,302
You'd be able to live, Julia.

762
00:43:49,338 --> 00:43:51,338
Come here.

763
00:43:51,373 --> 00:43:53,507
Let me show you.

764
00:43:59,982 --> 00:44:02,849
[muttering]

765
00:44:05,421 --> 00:44:08,388
<i>[soft music]</i>

766
00:44:12,227 --> 00:44:15,162
[breathes deeply]

767
00:44:25,641 --> 00:44:27,774
- We're there.
- Put it back.

768
00:44:27,810 --> 00:44:31,278
It's okay, it's okay.

769
00:44:31,313 --> 00:44:34,347
I need it.

770
00:44:34,383 --> 00:44:37,517
Put it back now, Martin.

771
00:44:38,921 --> 00:44:41,188
Suit yourself.

772
00:44:41,223 --> 00:44:43,190
[gasps]

773
00:44:43,225 --> 00:44:46,193
<i>[eerie music]</i>

774
00:45:00,642 --> 00:45:03,777
I understand why you're afraid.

775
00:45:03,812 --> 00:45:06,313
You don't want to lose yourself.

776
00:45:06,348 --> 00:45:08,548
But hear me on this.

777
00:45:08,584 --> 00:45:10,350
Martyring yourself to your pain

778
00:45:10,385 --> 00:45:11,852
isn't all it's advertised to be.

779
00:45:11,887 --> 00:45:14,888
It'll destroy you.

780
00:45:14,923 --> 00:45:18,325
There's no glory in that.

781
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:22,195
You might get Reynard, yes.

782
00:45:22,231 --> 00:45:25,298
But he'll still win.

783
00:45:25,334 --> 00:45:27,300
Anyways.
