1
00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:02,496
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:05,061
We summoned some kind of
killer mothman from another world.

3
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:06,401
My friends, we got separated,

4
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:08,318
and I just... I can't let them
fight The Beast on their own.

5
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:10,334
<i>You want me to come
to Fillory with you?</i>

6
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:12,673
All right, so there might be
a solution here, a weapon.

7
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:13,923
It sounds like if
we could find it,

8
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:15,091
<i>we could use it
to kill The Beast.</i>

9
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:16,115
Payment is due.

10
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:17,527
Apparently, marriage
here is different.

11
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:19,417
I can never leave Fillory.

12
00:00:19,486 --> 00:00:21,352
I have gifted you my bestowal.

13
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:24,823
<i>When you are ready to
face The Beast, imbibe it.</i>

14
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:26,053
We followed all the clues.

15
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:30,086
<i>We thought that she was leading
us to her, we summoned her.</i>

16
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:33,190
You know, I actually believed
Our Lady Underground chose me.

17
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:35,933
<i>You may address me
as Reynard the Fox,</i>

18
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:38,837
trickster of the faithful,
the pure of heart,

19
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:39,999
the very stupid.

20
00:00:42,576 --> 00:00:43,576
Hi, Martin.

21
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,251
Wait. You know
how to deal with gods.

22
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:58,019
You know how to
fuck up their shit.

23
00:00:58,091 --> 00:00:59,115
No.

24
00:00:59,192 --> 00:01:01,161
I wanna make a deal. Let's.

25
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,082
Help!

26
00:01:28,188 --> 00:01:30,054
Somebody!

27
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:44,266
There has got to
be someone in this

28
00:01:44,338 --> 00:01:47,775
motherfuckin',
goddamn magical forest.

29
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:21,966
Hungry, I assume?

30
00:02:22,676 --> 00:02:24,702
After all that being chased?

31
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:27,611
No, um, I'm not
being chased. Oh.

32
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,143
Usually they're being chased.

33
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,515
That I know of, no.

34
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,755
But you do need
some kind of help.

35
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:39,593
Uh, it's just where I come
from, there's a legend

36
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,926
about a witch with a
cottage made of candy.

37
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,464
Well, the cottage
is mostly wood.

38
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:48,901
And I'm more of a healer
and gardening enthusiast.

39
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:53,532
Okay. I need your help.

40
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,199
And you're offering...

41
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:57,100
Offering, I'm...

42
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,112
Gold is always good.

43
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,375
You would be helping the
next High King of Fillory.

44
00:03:01,448 --> 00:03:02,848
Okay.

45
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:06,148
Then my discount rate. One vial.

46
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:07,777
Vial of what?

47
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,722
Were you dropped on your head
as a child? Your blood, dumb-dumb.

48
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,358
Oh, there you are.

49
00:03:23,503 --> 00:03:24,903
We were so worried!

50
00:03:26,406 --> 00:03:27,465
You're a...

51
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,377
God-powered.

52
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,851
So it's a little hard to
kill me at the moment.

53
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:46,116
Thank God.

54
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:51,956
I mean, you know...
Thank God, Alice.

55
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:02,641
I hesitated with The Beast. I
should've... It's... It's my fault.

56
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:03,802
No, it's not.

57
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:06,472
No, he's right.
It's Julia's fault.

58
00:04:06,546 --> 00:04:08,879
No! Guys! She
was... She's not sane.

59
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:10,008
You think?

60
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,985
One small consolation is the
bitch is with The Beast right now,

61
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:15,022
and I can't really see
that going her way.

62
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:18,923
No. I... I'll explain
in a second. Um...

63
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,760
Can I have my blood back please?

64
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:24,841
Look, my friends. They're
fine. I don't need your...

65
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:25,865
No.

66
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,694
I took an hour out of my night.

67
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:34,069
You're in Fillory, Magician.
Be careful with strangers.

68
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:36,474
We only look whimsical.

69
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,543
Who was that?

70
00:04:41,748 --> 00:04:43,341
Uh, a local.

71
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:45,146
Okay, fuckers, huddle up.

72
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,318
A zillion bucks says The
Beast comes back any minute.

73
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:49,388
So what's the plan?

74
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:52,722
We lost the blade. So
we need a new something.

75
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:54,818
Um, especially
while Alice is still...

76
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:56,625
Juiced up? ELIOT:
We should all juice up.

77
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:57,959
Like The Beast.

78
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,000
Wellspring smoothies, stat.

79
00:05:09,609 --> 00:05:10,872
Ahh!

80
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:12,037
Shit.

81
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,206
Look, there's the
missing piece right there.

82
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,409
Oh, hey, I think I, uh... Yeah.

83
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:20,852
Gah! This is going great.

84
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,687
Let me try.

85
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,657
Wow, swallowin'
has its privileges.

86
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:54,780
Wow, it looks like...

87
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:56,414
A major drought's hit.

88
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,256
There's a bucket.

89
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,466
Oh, shit.

90
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,540
I knew The Beast came
here every day, but is it...

91
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:15,906
But is it even possible for him

92
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:17,638
to drain the
Wellspring that much?

93
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,191
Maybe he threw
something out of whack.

94
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:20,305
I vote we don't touch it,

95
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,713
on the grounds that
exploding Fillory wouldn't help.

96
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:24,011
Okay. We need a new plan.

97
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:25,084
What plan?

98
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:28,815
The Beast is gone, our squad
is a joke, what plan, exactly?

99
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,517
We'll figure it
out, we always do.

100
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,422
When it's a final to cheat on,

101
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,484
not when we're stuck
in some epic fantasy

102
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:37,497
that likes to behead its heroes
halfway through season one.

103
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,031
If we even are heroes.

104
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:44,763
We might be comic relief.

105
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,569
I thought you threw that out.

106
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:51,839
It's for emergencies.
Pass it around.

107
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:56,643
Okay. No Wellspring, no knife.

108
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:58,815
I have no idea what to do now.

109
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,683
So we are fucked without grease.

110
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:01,983
That sounds like us.

111
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:04,217
Must be a Monday.

112
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,555
Onward to glory.

113
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,345
Ah. Much better.

114
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,106
Why are, are we...

115
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:33,085
Oh, the food is
tremendous. Let's sit.

116
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,356
Are you familiar?

117
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:39,518
Word As Bond.

118
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:42,118
I assume the extra
bits enchant the blade

119
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:45,824
to kill me instantly in
the event I break it, eh?

120
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:49,293
Okay. Here's the deal...

121
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:50,928
You need to kill a god.

122
00:07:52,072 --> 00:07:53,973
Thrilling.

123
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,340
So you need to
get near him. Tricky.

124
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,572
Yes. But you can help.

125
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:01,006
Hmm.

126
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:05,009
His name is Reynard the Fox.

127
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:07,884
A trickster of some sort, yes?

128
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:10,014
Oh. That will be a challenge.

129
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,423
Well, you don't really
have much choice, do you?

130
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:15,926
Oh, well aware, you
have that stylish little blade.

131
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,089
I sure do.

132
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,163
Yes.

133
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:20,530
That reminds me to
insist the terms of our deal

134
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,195
include said blade
reverting to me

135
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:25,261
at the moment of
Reynard's demise.

136
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,533
Agreed?

137
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:27,665
Almost.

138
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,505
First, for the duration
of our agreement,

139
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:31,807
you do not hurt or act
against me in any way.

140
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,107
Mmm, fine.

141
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:37,645
Quentin, all of them.

142
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:39,845
You lay a finger,

143
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:46,025
this will put this in
the base of your skull.

144
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:50,464
You're not what I expected.

145
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,192
Once Reynard is dead,

146
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,734
I put the knife
down. Yours to take.

147
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:58,427
So this Reynard's
still out there?

148
00:08:58,505 --> 00:08:59,837
As far as she knows.

149
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:03,365
Yeah, it's why she needed the
knife, and why she needs The Beast.

150
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:04,483
Okay, I get it now,

151
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,680
but I also have to say
that is the dumbest thing

152
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:08,715
she could possibly have done.

153
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:11,650
Like I said, she's not sane
right now. I wouldn't be.

154
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:12,828
So what are we supposed to do?

155
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:13,911
Kill The Beast.

156
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:16,286
He's right. I know, it's awful.

157
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:17,915
But she chose to
double-cross us.

158
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:20,620
Look, I'm pissed, too, but
I would like to point out...

159
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,705
Okay, we don't have to
take a vote right this second.

160
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,755
Penny's right.
First things first.

161
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:26,800
We need to make a plan
to deal with The Beast.

162
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:29,768
Eliot! I thought for sure you...

163
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:32,771
Yeah. Me, too. Not yet.

164
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:35,399
Are you... Are you all right?

165
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,443
Um, I'll get everyone
something to eat.

166
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:39,535
That'd be amazing.

167
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,775
I think I like her.

168
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,248
I hope I like her.

169
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:57,321
Um, okay. This might
be something. Um...

170
00:09:57,397 --> 00:10:01,732
So, there's a place
called the Armory.

171
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:02,928
Weapons?

172
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:04,026
Books.

173
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:07,736
Uh, so, Rupert Chatwin...

174
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:11,107
He realizes that back home
World War II is still raging.

175
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:13,669
And he tells Jane and
Martin that he is going.

176
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:15,146
He is going to go fight.

177
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:16,945
Before he does,

178
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,679
he spends all night
in the Armory, reading.

179
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:24,922
And, you know, like, whatever
he finds, it doesn't say,

180
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:30,862
but his next move is to petition
Ember and Umber, for strength.

181
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,899
I mean, what if he
found something.

182
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:36,027
What if he found a
spell or a piece of,

183
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,632
I don't know,
Fillorian battle magic,

184
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:40,799
that was so strong that
he couldn't do it without...

185
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:41,967
Without juice. Yeah.

186
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:47,344
Because the thing is,
this is December, 1944.

187
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,735
I mean, he shows up
right in the middle of the...

188
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:52,547
Battle of the Bulge?

189
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:57,889
Wait, are you saying
that Rupert's secretly...

190
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,552
I'm saying...

191
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:04,564
Maybe he found something
powerful enough to help.

192
00:11:04,631 --> 00:11:06,361
Him win World War II?

193
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,066
Maybe.

194
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,768
Well, then I need the
Armory. Where is it?

195
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:17,372
Castle Whitespire.
Accessible to the King.

196
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:18,905
Oh.

197
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,002
Hey.

198
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,199
And if we can find the road,

199
00:11:21,247 --> 00:11:24,684
there's, um, a carriage that
runs in a continuous circle,

200
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:27,550
also at the disposal
of the King. So...

201
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:30,419
Okay. Whitespire it is.

202
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:34,223
Come on, everybody, grab snacks.

203
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:37,389
Yeah. About that. My
hands are in a fucking box.

204
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,122
So, Chatwin's Torrent.

205
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,965
I know that one.
It's a healing river.

206
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,231
Can it reattach hands?

207
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:45,363
Maybe?

208
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,168
I'm going. I'll catch
you on the flip.

209
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,051
Wait, no. I don't think
you should be going alone.

210
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,634
I'll go.

211
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,979
Um, healing water.

212
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:56,141
We're going to battle.
I'll grab like a gallon.

213
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:03,020
You're wiping your own
ass. So figure that out.

214
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:16,260
Souvenir?

215
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:17,736
Barometer.

216
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:20,638
I thought I should pay
attention to see if it gets warm.

217
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:27,036
Oh. Hey, guys.

218
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,078
Hey! Over here!

219
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,084
Oh, my God. Those
horses are so beautiful.

220
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,983
Ah. Hey, what are you doing?

221
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:35,146
I just really love horses.

222
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:36,245
Come on.

223
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:42,591
You have got to be kidding me.

224
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:44,688
I know, those
horses were so rude.

225
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,375
I guess they're a tad literal.
- Yeah.

226
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,630
I'd call needing to see an
actual crown on my head

227
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:49,930
is pretty goddamn literal.

228
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:52,472
Look, it's not just
about the carriage.

229
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,098
They're not gonna
let us into Whitespire

230
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:55,484
until you've been
crowned High King. So.

231
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:59,445
So, we need to get you crowned.

232
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:01,377
Uh...

233
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:03,607
Okay, yeah.

234
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:09,312
Um, so, there's a specific
coronation place in the forest.

235
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:11,600
There are four kings and queens.

236
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,752
Yeah, you get to
pick the other three.

237
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:17,563
Do I get to be a king?

238
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,394
Unless you want
me to pick Penny?

239
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:21,664
So, okay.

240
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:23,168
So we get to the coronation spot

241
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:24,829
by crossing the Rainbow Bridge.

242
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:28,102
"Rainbow Bridge"? Like, where
family pets go when they die?

243
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:30,006
No, I mean, not that I know of.

244
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:32,739
No, it's called that because of
the flowers that are everywhere.

245
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,007
Oh.

246
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,640
Um, but there is,
of course, no map.

247
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,015
But I know Martin
found it with a spell.

248
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:42,715
Well, we could
always just ask around.

249
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:46,186
Or we could make like Martin.

250
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:08,308
He loves me. He loves me not.
He loves me. He loves me not.

251
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,075
He loves me. Let's go.

252
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:29,067
Uh, please know I
heard every loophole.

253
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,971
"Puts the knife down."

254
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:35,497
You really think you
have a fighting chance?

255
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:38,343
I think I'm gonna
give it my best.

256
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:42,281
Oh, this is going to be fun.

257
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,778
Nice of Reynard to pull so
many hearts out of chests.

258
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,286
It's distinctive.

259
00:14:52,325 --> 00:14:53,987
Why do you suppose he does that?

260
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:56,589
He likes the taste.

261
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,027
Mm.

262
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,531
Brilliant, that's a laptop.

263
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:05,265
The things they come up with
when they don't have magic.

264
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:06,362
Yeah.

265
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:08,359
Like accounts that tweet
police scanner activity.

266
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,206
"Tweet"?

267
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:12,108
Birds have computer accounts?

268
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,575
Don't worry about it.

269
00:15:15,815 --> 00:15:16,908
Mmm.

270
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:19,281
Wait a minute.

271
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:22,186
They found five bodies
at a house in Florida.

272
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,780
Missing a couple of hearts.

273
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:32,829
Okay. Just try to keep
people away for a minute.

274
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:35,630
Nicely. Mmm-hmm.

275
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:39,339
Hey. This seat taken?

276
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:47,575
Excuse me, sir, this is...

277
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:49,878
Won't be but a moment.

278
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:22,112
He's still in Richard's body.

279
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:25,049
Richard doesn't care, darling.

280
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:26,244
I fucking do.

281
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:32,551
Also, I guess we
came for not much.

282
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,652
On the contrary. We've
verified what attracts Reynard.

283
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:37,591
What? Witches doing rituals?

284
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,423
I mean, that's thousands
of people every day.

285
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:42,534
Not this type of ritual.

286
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,397
Come on.

287
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:59,108
So, what do I do?

288
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:04,154
Well, per the books, you
strip and jump in, I guess.

289
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:06,921
Here, I'll help you.

290
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:09,360
You'll need to help him
sew those back on his wrists.

291
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:10,428
Who are you?

292
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:15,364
I watch the river and assist
those who require its magic.

293
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:20,302
This guy is fuckin' weird.

294
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:29,707
Go on.

295
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:40,349
Right. Go, go.

296
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,527
You know, you're very beautiful.

297
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:53,232
Where're you from? Hmm?

298
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:56,470
Earth? I love women from Earth.

299
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,745
Is it supposed
to take this long?

300
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:01,337
No.

301
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,076
He may have drowned.

302
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:04,777
Are you kiddin'?
Why didn't you...

303
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,613
There we go.

304
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:11,146
Are you sure I can't
interest you in an elixir?

305
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,919
It's small-batch,
and very fresh.

306
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:14,119
No, thank you.

307
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:17,391
I have a tooth powder that I
think you are going to love.

308
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:19,329
You know what?
We're kind of in a hurry.

309
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:23,302
I understand. As you
wish. Pleasure to serve.

310
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:27,400
I think he wants a tip.

311
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,369
Twenty gold pieces is customary.

312
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,104
Okay, that sounds like a lot.

313
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:32,702
Well, this is Chatwin's Torrent.

314
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:33,802
We don't have...

315
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:36,314
There was nothing about
charging in the books.

316
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:40,044
Oh, you'd rather pay in labor?
I think three to five years...

317
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,213
Are you fucking kidding me?

318
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,883
You said none of this
before I went in the river.

319
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,152
Because I have manners.

320
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:48,660
Are you even officially
affiliated with the Torrent?

321
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:49,889
Penny, chill out.

322
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,294
It's kind of an amateur calling.

323
00:18:51,364 --> 00:18:53,230
Oh, I see, yes, yes,
you're a con man.

324
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,299
No. Penny...

325
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,461
No! I know his type!

326
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,367
I've been ripped
off plenty of times

327
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:02,033
by smiling little snake
oil pricks like this dude.

328
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:03,167
Yes, all right.

329
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:06,144
Same in Detroit, same in
Mumbai, same in Fillory.

330
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:07,475
Okay.

331
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,174
Sorry, try it on the
next sap who needs

332
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:12,412
this natural resource
on public property.

333
00:19:13,386 --> 00:19:14,718
Good luck.

334
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,851
I'm sorry. He gets touchy.

335
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,585
It's... It's not personal.

336
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,784
Um...

337
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:23,159
These are diamond.

338
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,127
What the hell is diamond?

339
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:26,927
Here.

340
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,230
When you meet one scammer,
you've met 'em all. Let's go.

341
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,394
Okay.

342
00:19:45,317 --> 00:19:47,548
Okay, so this net...
This net you throw.

343
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,646
What sort of a
net catches a god?

344
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:52,692
Well, it's an obscure bit of
casting, but I assure you it works.

345
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:55,626
We'll just have to act
fast when the time comes.

346
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,062
It'll hold for a few seconds.

347
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:00,592
So...

348
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:03,034
I need a few items.

349
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:10,670
Okay, it might be better for
me to go alone for some of this.

350
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,371
Uh, can you drop
me at the playground?

351
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:16,214
I like to watch the little children
play. It's perfectly innocent.

352
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:37,136
El, we got your
note! Let's do this!

353
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:40,170
I call High Queen.

354
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:41,804
Hey, did it work?

355
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,604
Perfect. Lead the way.

356
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,720
It's fine. They're just healing.

357
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:51,471
Do you think he's
sleeping? Or dead?

358
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:52,954
I don't know. Should
we just go into the trunk?

359
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,344
Oh, pussies.

360
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:57,643
He looks dead.

361
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,184
I guess we're late.

362
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:07,617
Oh, dear.

363
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:12,589
Oh, dear.

364
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:23,169
I am the Knight of Crowns.

365
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:28,545
My apologies, I seem to have died
waiting for you aspirants to come.

366
00:22:30,316 --> 00:22:32,308
You are aspirants?

367
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:39,556
I'm the High King of
Fillory. I took a blood test.

368
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:42,624
Excellent. Excellent.
It's an honor.

369
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:46,532
Can we have the crowns please?

370
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,795
Certainly. Honored to oblige.

371
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,928
Just as soon as
you pass the test.

372
00:22:52,438 --> 00:22:54,100
Of course there's a test.

373
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:56,375
As you know,

374
00:22:56,442 --> 00:23:01,107
only a Child of Earth can
wear the crown of the High King.

375
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:03,913
I will ask you a
series of questions,

376
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:06,817
designed to root out all
pretenders to the throne.

377
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:11,085
Only a true High King will
hold the answers in his heart.

378
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,855
Come at me.

379
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:23,836
What popular American television
program stars actor Tim Daly?

380
00:23:25,104 --> 00:23:26,104
What the fuck?

381
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,234
He was on a lot of TV shows.

382
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:29,935
There is only one
correct answer.

383
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:31,671
Okay, give me the next question.

384
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:34,771
This hit single is performed

385
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,078
by offspring of
famous entertainers.

386
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:40,843
Dude, that is crazy vague.

387
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,287
You will receive a single hint.

388
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:45,984
Your hint is, "Beach Boys."

389
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:48,027
<i>Hold On</i> by Wilson Phillips.

390
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,096
That song is my jam.

391
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:53,792
Wait, all these questions
are from the '90s.

392
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:56,836
It's not the 1990s
on Earth right now?

393
00:23:56,902 --> 00:24:00,134
No, it, it's 2017.
And it's <i>Wings.</i>

394
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:02,504
The Tim Daly show was <i>Wings.</i>

395
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:03,837
Of course you know that.

396
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:05,810
Okay, '90s?

397
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,411
Ask me something
about Patrick Swayze.

398
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:11,780
You know of Swayze?

399
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:14,852
Oh, jeez.

400
00:24:23,896 --> 00:24:25,865
"Sorry about the
disruption, folks,

401
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:28,025
"but I always do the
last dance of the season.

402
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,599
"This year somebody
told me not to.

403
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:33,605
"So I'm gonna do my kind of
dancin' with a great partner,

404
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:35,866
"who's not only
a terrific dancer.

405
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:39,468
"Somebody who's taught me

406
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:40,843
"that there are people out there

407
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:42,711
"willing to stand
up for other people,

408
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:44,840
"no matter what it costs them.

409
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:51,516
"Somebody who's taught me
about the kind of person I wanna be.

410
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:54,851
"Miss Frances Houseman."

411
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:56,853
Oh...

412
00:24:57,563 --> 00:24:59,293
Your Majesty.

413
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:04,133
The crowns of Fillory are yours.

414
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,417
So, I guess we just put 'em on?

415
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:22,716
No! God! Stop!

416
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,254
I mean, I just think we
should do a ceremony.

417
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:29,022
This is only gonna happen once.

418
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:31,791
We are becoming
kings and queens.

419
00:25:33,399 --> 00:25:36,198
So it's important and
we should honor it.

420
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,036
Just, give me that.

421
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,869
Kneel, Eliot Waugh.

422
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:47,312
Would you just do it? It's
gonna be quick, I promise.

423
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:56,348
So, destiny is... It's bullshit.

424
00:25:56,422 --> 00:25:59,551
But you are a High
King in your blood,

425
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:01,753
and somehow that
makes sense. You know?

426
00:26:01,827 --> 00:26:02,886
And I just...

427
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:05,123
For what it's worth, I think
that you are going to be

428
00:26:05,197 --> 00:26:06,722
a really good king.

429
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:09,065
Um...

430
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:11,535
So, um, I dub thee...

431
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:14,167
Um...

432
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,799
I don't know, would you say
you're, like, more brave or merciful?

433
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,343
I'd say I'm neither.

434
00:26:19,845 --> 00:26:22,644
But I still plan to be a
spectacular monarch.

435
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:30,084
I hereby dub thee High
King Eliot the Spectacular.

436
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,356
Wow.

437
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:40,866
This feels as
natural as underwear.

438
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:47,270
Thank you.

439
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:51,276
By the power vested in me by...

440
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:53,709
I have no idea...

441
00:26:55,247 --> 00:27:00,584
I do hereby crown
you High Queen Margo,

442
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:03,447
the Destroyer.

443
00:27:03,522 --> 00:27:05,354
I mean that in the
best possible sense.

444
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:09,722
All hail. Everyone, clap.

445
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:20,038
I have known what you truly
are since the day we met.

446
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:23,566
Long may you reign.

447
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:37,285
I feel it's incumbent upon me to

448
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:39,587
promise never again
to betray you like I did.

449
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:44,588
I really, really am sorry.

450
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:48,065
I have some character
defects. I'm workin' on it.

451
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:50,864
Honestly.

452
00:27:58,443 --> 00:28:00,309
I'm working on some, too.

453
00:28:01,446 --> 00:28:03,711
Well, on that note,

454
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:04,977
I crown you

455
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:08,179
Queen Alice the Wise.

456
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:21,393
No, wait.

457
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:23,731
Since we're cleaning
slates and shit.

458
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,361
Give me.

459
00:28:27,673 --> 00:28:28,673
Q.

460
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:35,577
I could start by
saying something cruel

461
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,707
yet totally hilarious about you.

462
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:41,085
Let's be real, you're
an easy target.

463
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:47,222
But that's... That's because
you're honest about what you love,

464
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:51,720
and underneath it
all, that's inspiring.

465
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,826
And I'm sorry, too.

466
00:28:56,902 --> 00:29:00,839
Not about the sex, I don't
even really remember it.

467
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:04,667
But mostly my part in fucking up
something that was good for you.

468
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:08,180
Thanks, I think I fucked
it up just fine myself.

469
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,078
Now that we're ruling
a kingdom together,

470
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:11,878
I hope we can be
whatever we were again.

471
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:15,285
I guess you would
call that friends.

472
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:17,084
Let's go with that.

473
00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:19,922
I hereby crown you

474
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:23,952
King Quentin the Moderately
Socially Maladjusted.

475
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:27,726
Scrunch down.

476
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:29,930
Yeah.

477
00:29:40,312 --> 00:29:42,474
Royalty, bitches.

478
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:55,619
Okay.

479
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:02,996
Shit.

480
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:09,069
Hey, everything okay?

481
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:10,318
I'm going back to the Torrent.

482
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:12,140
You think that guy
did something to you?

483
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,490
'Cause you were a raging douche?

484
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:18,475
I'll sweet talk him, get him to fix
my hands, and I'll head to the castle.

485
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,813
Everything's under control.

486
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:35,833
Alice?

487
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:41,366
Apology accepted.

488
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,868
That was you apologizing
for what you did?

489
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:48,439
I just...

490
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:52,013
If we survive this, I hope
we can be friends still.

491
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,748
Look, I know it
might sound stupid,

492
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:03,995
but that's what I'm mad at you
for, and not the cheating part.

493
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:08,698
The part where what
you did made me lose you.

494
00:31:10,936 --> 00:31:12,905
And you were a big
part of my life, Quentin.

495
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:14,769
You can never lose me, Alice.

496
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:18,786
I mean, you can avoid me,
and you can hate me and...

497
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:20,142
I don't hate you.

498
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:24,939
Well, you can't lose me. Sorry.

499
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:32,054
I can't stop thinking.

500
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:37,794
We're gonna find
this epic spell, great.

501
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:42,125
But I'm afraid I'm just gonna

502
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,945
freeze again when The
Beast is in front of me.

503
00:31:43,969 --> 00:31:46,632
You're thinking about it wrong.

504
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:48,367
Cool under pressure
is not a talent.

505
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,375
It's a skill, and you
need to practice.

506
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:54,209
Come on.

507
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,824
We stood on a roof
together during the Trials

508
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:58,159
and you told me
that you were afraid

509
00:31:58,183 --> 00:31:59,776
to see what you
were really capable of.

510
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:07,514
That was then. So let's
see what you can do now.

511
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,487
I'm not sure it'll help.

512
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:11,791
Then do it for me, hell.

513
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:15,766
I'm not gonna lie. I... I'm
dying to see what you can do.

514
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:20,532
I'm not a Naturalist.

515
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,404
You know the spell, we
all do. We just sucked at it.

516
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:29,947
Let's see what you can do now.

517
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,595
It feels...

518
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,230
It's just like breathing.

519
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:55,803
See? Nice.

520
00:33:23,068 --> 00:33:24,969
So how do you feel now?

521
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,447
We're not getting back together.

522
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:46,254
Okay.

523
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:02,835
I've been wondering something.

524
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:06,137
Why didn't Reynard kill
you with your friends?

525
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,975
Why were you spared?

526
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:20,885
You weren't spared. Were you?

527
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:22,723
Look, let's not go there, okay?

528
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:25,059
You know, when I was a boy,

529
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:27,224
a man who was
meant to care for me

530
00:34:27,299 --> 00:34:30,599
bent me over his desk
and had me over and over,

531
00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:33,161
every time I was alone with him.

532
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:35,969
It helped me understand a truth.

533
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:39,500
You're powerful or you're weak.

534
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,672
If you're powerful,
you will survive.

535
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:46,144
So, what? You're
suggesting I just get over it?

536
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:47,708
Actually, yes.

537
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,524
How? Mutate?

538
00:34:54,726 --> 00:34:57,662
Take over a world? Kill a
bunch of grad students 39 times?

539
00:35:00,198 --> 00:35:01,962
You see, what you feel,

540
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:04,059
the haunted look in your eyes,

541
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:05,694
doesn't come from nowhere.

542
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:10,332
Then where does it come from?

543
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:15,036
In the center of your being,
there's a tiny beating heart.

544
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:18,841
What, you mean like my soul?

545
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:21,580
Part of it, yes.
The slimmest part.

546
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:23,315
But it holds specific power.

547
00:35:24,923 --> 00:35:26,915
It's called a Shade.

548
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:29,690
Shade. Yeah.

549
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:31,787
It's what makes you feel

550
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:33,991
the pain will burn
you till there's nothing.

551
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:38,565
And, yes, it's
also there for love,

552
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:39,935
but let's be frank, darling,

553
00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:41,849
you're more likely to
throw yourself off a bridge

554
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:43,739
than ever love again.

555
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,307
I felt that way.

556
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:53,245
And I knew it crippled me
when I needed to be strong.

557
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:54,911
As you do now.

558
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:04,363
You know...

559
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:10,930
I don't care for
people, as a rule.

560
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:19,008
But I like you.

561
00:36:20,445 --> 00:36:21,606
You have promise.

562
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,344
With the right control,
you would be formidable.

563
00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:29,252
Even a worthy collaborator.

564
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:33,720
I have plans. You
could be part of them.

565
00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:37,819
If?

566
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:41,594
Do what I did. Sever your Shade.

567
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,665
Sever. Mmm.

568
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:46,899
It's not hard.
You'll feel better.

569
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:52,366
You'll feel happy. I
can show you how.

570
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:57,004
No, thank you.

571
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:01,609
Do let me know if
you change your mind.

572
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,436
Eliot!

573
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,707
The crown suits you. Of course.

574
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:58,800
Who are all these people?

575
00:37:58,877 --> 00:37:59,877
The Pickwick family.

576
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,379
They'd been running things
till Children of Earth came.

577
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:03,540
Oh.

578
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:06,844
Your Highness.

579
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:09,581
Tick Pickwick of the Northern
Marsh Pickwicks, at your service.

580
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:12,123
The rest of the King's
Council will arrive shortly.

581
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,214
Great.

582
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:17,160
So glad you're here.
There are a few problems.

583
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:20,897
Uh, several problems that could
use your immediate attention.

584
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:23,059
Ah, um, okay. Great. We
should probably get started.

585
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,330
First, your Throne Room.

586
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:28,100
I'm afraid it's been locked a long
time. We're looking for the key.

587
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:30,665
That's fine. Uh, take
me straight to the Armory.

588
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:11,311
The Armory, Your Highnesses.

589
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:15,443
Well, this is underwhelming.

590
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,455
It's supposed to
be full of books.

591
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:25,124
<i>Strategies for Trapping
Tomato-Eating Garden Fairies.</i>

592
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,687
Yeah, no.

593
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:28,925
Someone took all
the battle magic.

594
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,595
It's not like The Beast is
coming to find us any second.

595
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:33,399
Wait, this is something.

596
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:36,899
It's a workbook on
spells. Serious ones.

597
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:40,503
Looks like battle magic. But
the actual spells aren't here.

598
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:44,346
Hmm. Like notes on
cake, but no actual recipes.

599
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,247
It's helpful.

600
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:48,149
Who wrote it?

601
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,812
Oh, my God.

602
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:51,117
What?

603
00:39:51,189 --> 00:39:53,454
I know where we need to go.

604
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:56,959
Brakebills?

605
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:04,969
Hello? Mister, uh...

606
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:06,331
Mister...

607
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:10,866
Fuck!

608
00:40:13,111 --> 00:40:14,409
Can I help you?

609
00:40:15,947 --> 00:40:17,848
Hell, yes, you can.
These don't work.

610
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:19,578
Oh, by all means,
request a refund.

611
00:40:19,651 --> 00:40:21,677
Very funny. You
did this on purpose.

612
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:24,621
Did what? Help an
ungrateful Child of Earth?

613
00:40:24,689 --> 00:40:26,300
Look, I'll pay you
whatever you want. Okay?

614
00:40:26,324 --> 00:40:27,417
I'm serious, okay?

615
00:40:27,492 --> 00:40:28,736
I am friends with
the kings and queens.

616
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,695
You wanna be a duke,
great, I got you. I...

617
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:33,197
Actions have
consequences, Penny.

618
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:36,063
Even glib words spoken
in casual arrogance.

619
00:40:36,134 --> 00:40:38,103
It's past time you learned.

620
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:40,297
Especially, given the
position you will occupy soon.

621
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:41,634
What position?

622
00:40:41,706 --> 00:40:43,402
You know what? I've
done you a service.

623
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:48,003
No, no, look! Hey!
I'm sorry. Okay?

624
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,379
Please fix my hands.

625
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,544
Let's see, how do I put this in
a way that you will understand?

626
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:58,179
Ah. Go fuck yourself.

627
00:40:58,256 --> 00:40:59,884
No, wait!

628
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:03,220
Fuck!

629
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:08,599
Hang on to this while I'm gone?

630
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:11,195
Oh.

631
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:14,496
You guys all packed?

632
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:15,631
Yeah.

633
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:21,203
El, thank you.

634
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:22,423
For what?

635
00:41:22,447 --> 00:41:25,906
For taking one for the team to
the tune of the rest of my life?

636
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,849
I'm trying to see this
ruling thing as an adventure.

637
00:41:33,024 --> 00:41:35,755
Apparently, we have
enemies to the north and south,

638
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:38,490
plus broken infrastructure,

639
00:41:38,563 --> 00:41:40,828
and huge magic issues
thanks to The Beast

640
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:42,799
and his Wellspring addiction.

641
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:45,462
And do you know they don't
know what champagne is here?

642
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,239
I plan on inventing it.

643
00:41:49,307 --> 00:41:52,675
I'd like to be known as
the "Champagne King."

644
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:56,044
It has a ring to it.

645
00:41:56,114 --> 00:41:57,275
Right? Mmm-hmm.

646
00:41:57,382 --> 00:41:59,851
I'm really looking forward
to drinking socially.

647
00:42:00,385 --> 00:42:01,648
Like the French.

648
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:11,027
So, uh, in the books,

649
00:42:11,095 --> 00:42:15,362
time doesn't exactly run the
same speed on Earth as in Fillory.

650
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:19,103
I mean, look,
sometimes it got screwy

651
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:21,503
when Jane and Martin
would go back and forth.

652
00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:23,999
But not always.

653
00:42:26,444 --> 00:42:28,345
It's gonna be fine, El.

654
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:33,183
Yeah. Yeah.

655
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:38,713
Or I'll just live out my days
waiting for my friends to return,

656
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,622
and die alone.

657
00:42:46,697 --> 00:42:49,826
You know, it's considered
extremely disrespectful

658
00:42:49,901 --> 00:42:51,995
to touch a king
without permission.

659
00:42:55,206 --> 00:43:01,237
But, um, I think you should
probably hug me right now.

660
00:43:11,656 --> 00:43:15,684
It'll also be okay if you just
gave my ass, like, a little squeeze.

661
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:23,200
Feel free to double-check
this before I get started.

662
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,428
Julia?

663
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:41,348
Why do you want to
help me with my Shade?

664
00:43:43,054 --> 00:43:46,684
Without your Shade you'd
see a lot of things differently.

665
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,320
You'd be able to live, Julia.

666
00:43:52,897 --> 00:43:55,833
Come here. Let me show you.

667
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,432
We're there.

668
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,696
Put it back.

669
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:33,670
It's okay. It's okay.

670
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:35,867
I need it.

671
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:39,834
Put it back now, Martin.

672
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,811
Suit yourself.

673
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:07,634
I understand why you're afraid.

674
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,799
You don't want to lose yourself.

675
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:12,207
But hear me on this.

676
00:45:12,276 --> 00:45:13,972
Martyring yourself to your pain

677
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:15,411
isn't all it's advertised to be.

678
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:17,141
It'll destroy you.

679
00:45:18,683 --> 00:45:20,675
There's no glory in that.

680
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:24,388
You might get Reynard. Yes.

681
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:27,854
But he'll still win.

682
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:30,751
Anyways.
