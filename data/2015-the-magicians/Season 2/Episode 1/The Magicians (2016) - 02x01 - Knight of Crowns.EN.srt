1
00:00:01,786 --> 00:00:04,164
We summoned some kind of killer
moth man from another world. PUTA

2
00:00:04,284 --> 00:00:05,884
My friends who got separated
and I just--

3
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:07,385
I can't let them fight
The Beast on their own.

4
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,816
<i>You want me to come
to Fillory with you?</i>

5
00:00:09,936 --> 00:00:11,769
All right, so there might be
a solution here, a weapon.

6
00:00:11,804 --> 00:00:13,271
<i>It sounds like, if we could find it,</i>

7
00:00:13,306 --> 00:00:14,672
<i>we could use it to kill The Beast.</i>

8
00:00:14,707 --> 00:00:16,407
- Payment is due.
- Apparently marriage here

9
00:00:16,442 --> 00:00:18,576
- is different.
- I can never leave Fillory.

10
00:00:18,611 --> 00:00:20,544
I have gifted you my Bestowal.

11
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,880
<i>When you are ready to face The Beast,</i>

12
00:00:22,915 --> 00:00:24,115
<i>imbibe it.</i>

13
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,483
We followed all the clues.

14
00:00:25,518 --> 00:00:28,119
<i>We thought
that She was leading us to Her.</i>

15
00:00:28,154 --> 00:00:29,654
<i>We summoned Her.</i>

16
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:32,990
You know, I actually believed
Our Lady Underground chose me.

17
00:00:33,026 --> 00:00:35,159
<i>You may address me
as Reynard the Fox,</i>

18
00:00:35,194 --> 00:00:38,195
Trickster of the faithful,
the pure of heart,

19
00:00:38,231 --> 00:00:42,133
the very stupid.

20
00:00:42,168 --> 00:00:44,068
Hi, Martin.

21
00:00:51,411 --> 00:00:53,411
Ahh!

22
00:00:53,446 --> 00:00:54,578
Wait.

23
00:00:54,614 --> 00:00:55,780
You know how to deal with gods.

24
00:00:55,815 --> 00:00:58,015
You know how to fuck up their shit.

25
00:00:58,051 --> 00:01:00,418
- I want to make a deal.
- Let's.

26
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:21,972
<i>♪ We learned how ♪</i>

27
00:01:22,008 --> 00:01:24,308

00:01:41,394 --> 00:01:42,960
There's gotta be someone

00:01:42,995 --> 00:01:46,831

goddamn magical forest.

00:01:46,866 --> 00:01:48,366

35
00:01:48,401 --> 00:01:50,234

00:01:50,269 --> 00:01:52,303
People are dying.

40
00:02:19,499 --> 00:02:21,365
Hungry, I assume?

41
00:02:21,401 --> 00:02:24,535
After all that being chased?

42
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,103
No, um, I'm not being chased.

43
00:02:26,139 --> 00:02:29,373
Oh.
Usually they're being chased.

44
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:32,843
That I know of, no.

45
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,814
But you do need some kind of help.

46
00:02:36,849 --> 00:02:38,783
Uh, it's just where
I come from there's a legend

47
00:02:38,818 --> 00:02:42,186
about a witch
with a cottage made of candy.

48
00:02:42,221 --> 00:02:43,721
Well, the cottage is mostly wood,

49
00:02:43,756 --> 00:02:46,390
and I'm more of a healer and...

50
00:02:46,426 --> 00:02:48,259
gardening enthusiast.

51
00:02:48,294 --> 00:02:51,470
Okay.

52
00:02:51,506 --> 00:02:52,805
I need your help.

53
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,207
And you're offering...?

54
00:02:55,243 --> 00:02:58,377
- Offering? Um--
- Gold...is always good.

55
00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:00,880
You would be helping
the next High King of Fillory.

56
00:03:00,915 --> 00:03:02,248
Okay.

57
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:04,150
Then my discount rate.

58
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:05,351
One vial.

59
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:07,019
Vial of what?

60
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:08,521
Were you dropped on your head
as a child?

61
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:12,291
Your blood, dum-dum.

62
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:22,368
There you are.

63
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:25,504
We were so worried.

64
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,673
You're, uh...

65
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:35,181
God-powered.

66
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:38,551
So it's a little hard
to kill me at the moment.

67
00:03:42,323 --> 00:03:44,056
Ahh!

68
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:46,625
Thank God.

69
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:49,562
I mean, you know,

70
00:03:49,597 --> 00:03:52,731
thank God, Alice.

71
00:03:57,605 --> 00:03:59,071
I hesitated.

72
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:00,773
With The Beast,
I should have--it's--

73
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:01,941
it's my fault.

74
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:03,142
No, it's not, I--

75
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:04,443
No, he's right.

76
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:05,444
It's Julia's fault.

77
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,745
No, guys.

78
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:09,248
- She--she's not sane.
- You think?

79
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:10,549
One small consolation

80
00:04:10,585 --> 00:04:12,151
is the bitch is
with The Beast right now,

81
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:14,119
and I can't really see
that going her way.

82
00:04:14,155 --> 00:04:17,623
No, it, uh,
I'll explain it in a second.

83
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:20,426
Um, can I have my blood back, please?

84
00:04:21,996 --> 00:04:23,128
Look, my friends, they're fine.

85
00:04:23,164 --> 00:04:25,798
- I don't need your--
- No.

86
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,934
I took an hour out of my night.

87
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,303
You're in Fillory, Magician.

88
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:33,472
Be careful with strangers.

89
00:04:33,507 --> 00:04:36,175
We only look whimsical.

90
00:04:39,714 --> 00:04:42,414
- Who was that?
- Uh, a local.

91
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:45,417
Okay, fuckers, huddle up.

92
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:47,353
Zillion bucks says The Beast
comes back any minute,

93
00:04:47,388 --> 00:04:48,687
so what's the plan?

94
00:04:48,723 --> 00:04:51,857
We lost the blade,
so we need a new something.

95
00:04:51,893 --> 00:04:54,260
Um, especially while Alice
is still--

96
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:55,928
- Juiced up?
- We should all juice up.

97
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:59,398
Like The Beast.
Wellspring smoothies, stat.

98
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:12,177
Ahh!
Shit.

99
00:05:12,213 --> 00:05:14,513
There's a missing piece right there.

100
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:16,482
Oh, hey, I think I--
uh, yeah.

101
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:18,784
Ahh!

102
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,219
This is going great.

103
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:22,187
Let me try.

104
00:05:29,764 --> 00:05:32,898
Wow, swallowing has its privileges.

105
00:05:52,954 --> 00:05:55,654
- Wow, it looks like--
- A major drought's hit.

106
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,823
There's a bucket.

107
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:06,398
Shit.

108
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:13,739
I knew The Beast came here
every day, but is it--

109
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:15,107
but is it even possible for him

110
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:16,809
to drain the Wellspring that much?

111
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:18,344
He really threw something
out of whack.

112
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:20,045
I vote we don't touch it
on the grounds

113
00:06:20,081 --> 00:06:21,947
that exploding Fillory wouldn't help.

114
00:06:21,983 --> 00:06:23,248
Okay.
We need a new plan.

115
00:06:23,284 --> 00:06:25,184
What plan?
The Beast is gone.

116
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:28,053
Our squad is a joke.
What plan, exactly?

117
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:29,755
We'll figure it out.
We always do.

118
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,390
When it's a final to cheat on,

119
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:33,625
not when we're stuck
in some epic fantasy

120
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:38,397
that likes to behead its heroes
halfway through season one.

121
00:06:38,432 --> 00:06:41,867
If we even are heroes.

122
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:45,037
We might be comic relief.

123
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:48,941
I thought you threw that out.

124
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:52,011
It's for emergencies.
Pass it around.

125
00:06:52,046 --> 00:06:55,881
Okay.
No Wellspring, no knife.

126
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:58,117
I have no idea what to do now.

127
00:06:58,152 --> 00:07:00,019
So we are fucked without grease.

128
00:07:00,054 --> 00:07:03,822
- That sounds like us.
- Must be a Monday.

129
00:07:03,858 --> 00:07:05,858
Onward to glory.

130
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:19,381
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny

131
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:23,142
Ah, much better.

132
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:29,214
Why are--are we--

133
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,417
Ah, the food is tremendous.

134
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:34,920
Let's sit.

135
00:07:34,955 --> 00:07:38,123
- You familiar?
- Word as bond?

136
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:41,493
Uh, I assume the extra bits
enchant the blade

137
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:43,128
to kill me instantly

138
00:07:43,164 --> 00:07:46,765
in the event I break it, eh.

139
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:48,567
Okay, here's the deal--

140
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:51,336
You need to kill a god.

141
00:07:51,372 --> 00:07:53,472
Thrilling.

142
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:55,174
So you need to get near him.

143
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:58,877
- Tricky.
- Yes, but you can help.

144
00:07:58,913 --> 00:08:00,879
Mm.

145
00:08:00,915 --> 00:08:04,083
His...name
is Reynard the Fox.

146
00:08:04,118 --> 00:08:07,386
A trickster of some sorts, yes?

147
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:09,221
Oh, that will be a challenge.

148
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:11,356
Well, you don't really have
much choice, do you?

149
00:08:11,392 --> 00:08:15,127
Oh, well aware you have
that stylish little blade.

150
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,129
I sure do.

151
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,765
That reminds me to insist
the terms of our deal

152
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,101
include said blade reverting to me

153
00:08:22,136 --> 00:08:24,603
at the moment of Reynard's demise.

154
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:26,872
- Agreed?
- Almost.

155
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:28,740
First, for the duration
of our agreement,

156
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:30,943
you do not hurt
or act against me in any way.

157
00:08:30,978 --> 00:08:34,379
Mm, fine.

158
00:08:34,415 --> 00:08:36,882
Quentin, all of them.

159
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:39,918
You lay a finger,

160
00:08:39,954 --> 00:08:44,123
this will put this

161
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:47,793
in the base of your skull.

162
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:49,294
You're not what I expected.

163
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,764
Once Reynard is dead,
I put the knife down.

164
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,067
Yours to take.

165
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:57,836
So this Reynard's still out there?

166
00:08:57,872 --> 00:08:59,404
As far as she knows.

167
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,973
Yeah, it's why she needed the knife

168
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:02,441
and why she needs The Beast.

169
00:09:02,476 --> 00:09:04,643
Okay, I get it now,
but I also have to say

170
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:07,746
that is the dumbest thing
she could possibly have done.

171
00:09:07,781 --> 00:09:10,215
Like I said,
she's not sane right now.

172
00:09:10,251 --> 00:09:11,984
- I wouldn't be.
- So what are we supposed to do?

173
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:14,052
- Kill The Beast.
- He's right.

174
00:09:14,088 --> 00:09:15,621
You know, it's awful,

175
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:17,256
but she chose
to double-cross us.

176
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,791
Look, I'm pissed too,
but I would like to point out--

177
00:09:19,827 --> 00:09:21,860
Okay, we don't have to take
a vote right this second.

178
00:09:21,896 --> 00:09:23,495
Penny's right.
First things first.

179
00:09:23,531 --> 00:09:26,431
We need to make a plan
to deal with The Beast.

180
00:09:26,467 --> 00:09:27,933
Eliot!

181
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:29,268
I thought for sure you--

182
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:32,171
Yeah, me too.
Not yet.

183
00:09:32,206 --> 00:09:34,573
Are--are you all right?

184
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:37,743
Um, I'll--I'll get everyone
something to eat.

185
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:39,912
That would be amazing.

186
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:45,684
I think I like her.

187
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,653
I hope I like her.

188
00:09:53,327 --> 00:09:55,928
Um, okay.
This might be something.

189
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:59,598
Um, so there's a-a-a place

190
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:00,966
called The Armory.

191
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:03,202
- Weapons?
- Books.

192
00:10:03,237 --> 00:10:06,271
Uh, So Rupert Chatwin,

193
00:10:06,307 --> 00:10:09,107
uh, he realizes that back home,

194
00:10:09,143 --> 00:10:10,409
World War II is still raging

195
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:13,078
and he tells Jane and Martin
that he is going--

196
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,914
he's--he's going to go fight.
Before he does,

197
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,984
uh, he spends all night
in The Armory reading.

198
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,853
Uh, and, uh, you know,
like, whatever he finds,

199
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:24,156
it doesn't say,

200
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:28,760
but his next move
is to petition Ember and Umber

201
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:30,262
for strength.

202
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,097
I mean, what--
what if he found something?

203
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:34,366
What if he found, uh, a spell

204
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:37,836
or a piece of, I don't know,
Fillorian Battle Magic

205
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:39,938
that was so strong
that he couldn't do it without--

206
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:41,707
- Without juice?
- Yeah, because the--

207
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:44,576
okay, the thing is, this is, uh,

208
00:10:44,612 --> 00:10:48,113
December, 1944.

209
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,881
I mean, he shows up
right in the middle of the--

210
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:53,585
Battle of the Bulge.

211
00:10:53,621 --> 00:10:57,189
Wait, are you saying
that Rupert secretly--

212
00:10:57,224 --> 00:10:59,725
I'm saying, uh...

213
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,129
maybe he found something
powerful enough to help.

214
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,365
And win World War II?

215
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,768
Maybe.

216
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:12,304
Well then, I need The Armory.
Where is it?

217
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:15,974
Castle Whitespire.
Accessible to...

218
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:16,975
the King.

219
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:19,311
Oh, hey.

220
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,747
And if we can find
the road, there's, um,

221
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:24,483
a carriage that runs
in a continuous circle, uh,

222
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:27,085
also at the disposal
of the King, so...

223
00:11:27,121 --> 00:11:30,555
Okay.
Whitespire it is.

224
00:11:30,591 --> 00:11:33,792
Come on, everybody.
Grab snacks.

225
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:35,427
Yeah, uh, about that.

226
00:11:35,462 --> 00:11:36,795
My hands are in a fucking box,

227
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,997
so Chatwin's Torrent.

228
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:42,134
I-I know that one.
It's, um, it's a healing river.

229
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:44,303
- Can it reattach hands?
- Maybe.

230
00:11:44,338 --> 00:11:46,505
I'm going.
I'll catch you on the flip.

231
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,407
Wait, no, I don't think
you should be going alone.

232
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:52,044
I'll go.
Um, healing water?

233
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,414
We're going to battle.
I'll grab, like, a gallon.

234
00:11:58,686 --> 00:12:01,753
You're wiping your own ass,
so figure that out.

235
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:16,702
- Souvenir?
- Barometer.

236
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:20,672
Thought I should pay attention
to see if it gets warm.

237
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:27,646
Whoa. Hey, guys.

238
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:29,281
Hey, over here!

239
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:31,283
Oh, my God,
those horses are so beautiful.

240
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:33,085
Uh, hey.
What are you doing?

241
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,687
- I just really love horses.
- Come on.

242
00:12:35,723 --> 00:12:36,855
Hup!

243
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,727
You have got to be kidding me.

244
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:43,962
I know, those horses were so rude.

245
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:45,364
I guess they're a tad literal.

246
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:47,399
Yeah. I'd call needing to see
an actual crown

247
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,267
on my head as pretty goddamn literal.

248
00:12:49,303 --> 00:12:51,536
Look, it's not just
about the carriage.

249
00:12:51,572 --> 00:12:53,405
They're not gonna let us
into Whitespire

250
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,407
until you've been crowned
High King, so...

251
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:58,844
So we--we need
to get you crowned.

252
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,513
Uh...

253
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:03,949
Okay, yeah.
Um, so there's a--

254
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:07,552
there's a specific coronation place

255
00:13:07,588 --> 00:13:09,187
in the forest.

256
00:13:09,223 --> 00:13:10,622
There are four kings and queens.

257
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:15,360
Yeah, you get to pick
the other three.

258
00:13:15,396 --> 00:13:16,728
Do I get to be a king?

259
00:13:16,764 --> 00:13:18,730
Unless you want me to pick Penny.

260
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:22,267
So, okay, so we get
to the coronation spot

261
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,102
by crossing the Rainbow Bridge.

262
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:27,372
Rainbow Bridge? Like where
family pets go when they die?

263
00:13:27,408 --> 00:13:29,207
No.
I mean, not that I know of.

264
00:13:29,243 --> 00:13:31,777
No, it's called that because of
the flowers that are everywhere.

265
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:34,212
- Oh.
- Um, but there is, of course,

266
00:13:34,248 --> 00:13:35,847
no map,

267
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:39,284
but I know Martin found it
with a spell.

268
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:43,088
Well, we could always
just ask around.

269
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:45,824
Or we could make like Martin.

270
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,641
He loves me.

271
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,075
He loves me not.

272
00:14:04,111 --> 00:14:06,578
He loves me.

273
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:08,547
He loves me not.

274
00:14:08,582 --> 00:14:11,716
Uh, he loves me.
Let's go.

275
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:25,931
Ah.

276
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:29,134
Uh, please know
I heard every loophole.

277
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:31,770
"Put the knife down."

278
00:14:31,805 --> 00:14:34,639
You really think
you have a fighting chance?

279
00:14:34,675 --> 00:14:37,576
I think I'm gonna give it my best.

280
00:14:37,611 --> 00:14:40,612
Oh, this is going to be fun.

281
00:14:42,774 --> 00:14:46,614
Nice of Reynard to pull
so many hearts out of chests.

282
00:14:46,854 --> 00:14:48,502
It's, uh, distinctive.

283
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,392
Why do you suppose he does that?

284
00:14:53,427 --> 00:14:56,228
- He likes the taste.
- Mm.

285
00:14:58,332 --> 00:15:00,966
Brilliant, that, uh, laptop.

286
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:03,802
The things they come up with
when they don't have magic.

287
00:15:03,838 --> 00:15:07,105
Yeah, like accounts that tweet
police scanner activity.

288
00:15:07,141 --> 00:15:08,440
"Tweet"?

289
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:11,944
Birds have computer accounts?

290
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:14,112
Don't worry about it.

291
00:15:14,148 --> 00:15:17,583
- Mm.
- Wait a minute.

292
00:15:17,618 --> 00:15:20,853
They found five bodies
at a house in Florida.

293
00:15:20,888 --> 00:15:22,688
Missing a couple of hearts.

294
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:30,696
Okay, just try to keep people
away for a minute.

295
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:34,900
- Nicely.
- Mm-hmm.

296
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:38,303
Hey, is this seat taken?

297
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:45,344
Excuse me, sir, this is--

298
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:47,512
Won't be but a moment.

299
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:20,646
He's still in Richard's body.

300
00:16:20,681 --> 00:16:23,782
Richard doesn't care, darling.

301
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,751
I fucking do.

302
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:31,023
Well, so I guess
we came for not much.

303
00:16:31,058 --> 00:16:34,426
On the contrary, we've
verified what attracts Reynard.

304
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:35,961
What?
Witches doing rituals?

305
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:37,930
I mean, that's thousands
of people every day.

306
00:16:37,965 --> 00:16:40,899
Not this type of ritual.

307
00:16:44,071 --> 00:16:45,737
Come on.

308
00:16:54,815 --> 00:16:58,050
So, what do I do?

309
00:16:58,085 --> 00:17:00,085
Well, per the books,

310
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,789
you strip and jump in, I guess.

311
00:17:03,824 --> 00:17:05,590
Here, I'll help you.

312
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:08,093
You'll need to help him
sew those back on his wrists.

313
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:10,696
- Who are you?
- I watch the river.

314
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:13,865
And assist those
who require its magic.

315
00:17:17,004 --> 00:17:18,937
This guy is fucking weird.

316
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,580
Go on.

317
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:39,291
Go. Go, go.

318
00:17:47,668 --> 00:17:50,135
You know, you're very beautiful.

319
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:52,004
Where are you from, hmm?

320
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:53,238
Earth?

321
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:56,241
Love women from Earth.

322
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:58,410
Is it supposed to take this long?

323
00:17:58,445 --> 00:18:01,546
No.
He may have drowned.

324
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:03,315
Are you kidding?
Why didn't you--

325
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:07,319
Oh, oh, oh.
There we go.

326
00:18:07,354 --> 00:18:09,621
Are you sure I can't interest
you in an elixir?

327
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:11,556
It--it's small batch
and very fresh.

328
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:14,226
- No, thank you.
- I have a tooth powder

329
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:15,927
that I think you are going to love.

330
00:18:15,963 --> 00:18:18,363
You know what?
We're kinda in a hurry.

331
00:18:18,399 --> 00:18:20,766
I understand.
As you wish.

332
00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:22,734
Pleasure to serve.

333
00:18:24,972 --> 00:18:26,104
I think he wants a tip.

334
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,106
20 gold pieces is customary.

335
00:18:28,142 --> 00:18:29,708
Okay, that sounds like a lot.

336
00:18:29,743 --> 00:18:31,076
Well, this is Chatwin's Torrent.

337
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,278
We don't have--
there was nothing

338
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:34,880
about charging in the books.

339
00:18:34,915 --> 00:18:37,349
Oh, uh, you'd rather pay in labor?

340
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:38,784
I think three to five years.

341
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:40,819
Are you fucking kidding me?

342
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:43,288
You said none of this
before I went in the river.

343
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:44,790
Because I have manners--

344
00:18:44,825 --> 00:18:47,392
Are you even officially
affiliated with the Torrent?

345
00:18:47,428 --> 00:18:48,593
Penny, chill out.

346
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:49,961
It's kind of an amateur calling.

347
00:18:49,997 --> 00:18:51,963
Oh, I see.
Yes, yes, you're a con man.

348
00:18:51,999 --> 00:18:54,933
- No, Penny--
- No, I know his type.

349
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:56,902
I've been ripped off plenty of times

350
00:18:56,937 --> 00:19:00,639
by smiling little snake oil
pricks like this dude.

351
00:19:00,674 --> 00:19:02,207
- Okay, all right.
- Same in Detroit,

352
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:04,943
same in Mumbai, same in Fillory.

353
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:07,079
- Okay.
- Sorry, try it on the next sap

354
00:19:07,114 --> 00:19:11,983
who needs this natural resource
on public property.

355
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:13,585
Good luck.

356
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,488
I'm sorry.
He gets touchy.

357
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:18,623
It's--it's not personal.

358
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:21,827
Um, these are diamond.

359
00:19:21,862 --> 00:19:25,130
- What the hell is diamond?
- Here.

360
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:27,933
When you meet one scammer,
you met 'em all. Let's go.

361
00:19:27,968 --> 00:19:29,901
Okay.

362
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:44,649
Okay, so this net--
this net you throw,

363
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:46,184
what sort of a net catches a god?

364
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,719
Oh, it's an obscure bit of casting,

365
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:49,588
but I assure you it works.

366
00:19:49,623 --> 00:19:52,290
We'll just have to act fast
when the time comes.

367
00:19:52,326 --> 00:19:54,726
It'll hold for a few seconds.

368
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:57,662
So...

369
00:19:57,698 --> 00:19:59,798
I need a few items.

370
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:07,439
Okay, it might be better for
me to go alone for some of this.

371
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:09,774
Uh, can you drop me
at the playground?

372
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,810
I like to watch
the little children play.

373
00:20:11,845 --> 00:20:14,479
It's perfectly innocent.

374
00:20:29,763 --> 00:20:32,531
Al, we got your note.

375
00:20:32,566 --> 00:20:35,000
Let's do this.

376
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:36,768
I call High Queen.

377
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:38,803
Did it work?

378
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:41,239
Perfect.
Lead the way.

379
00:20:51,852 --> 00:20:54,586
It's fine.
They're just healing.

00:21:45,205 --> 00:21:48,106
Do you think he's sleeping or dead?

392
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,041
I don't know, should we just
go into the trunk?

393
00:21:50,077 --> 00:21:52,944
Oh, pussies.

394
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,081
- He looks dead.
- I guess we're late.

395
00:22:02,456 --> 00:22:04,589
Oh, dear.

396
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:10,929
Oh, dear.

397
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:19,237
I am the Knight of Crowns.

398
00:22:19,273 --> 00:22:21,673
Uh, my apologies.

399
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:26,344
I seem to have died waiting
for you aspirants to come.

400
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:30,382
Y-y-you are aspirants?

401
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:32,083
Uh--

402
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:34,853
I'm the High King of Fillory.

403
00:22:34,888 --> 00:22:36,187
I took a blood test.

404
00:22:36,223 --> 00:22:41,026
Excellent, excellent.
It's an honor.

405
00:22:41,061 --> 00:22:43,328
Can we have the crowns, please?

406
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:45,597
Certainly.
Honored to oblige.

407
00:22:45,632 --> 00:22:48,867
Just as soon as you pass the test.

408
00:22:48,902 --> 00:22:51,069
Of course there's a test.

409
00:22:51,104 --> 00:22:55,040
As you know, only a Child Of Earth

410
00:22:55,075 --> 00:22:58,710
can wear the crown of the High King.

411
00:22:58,745 --> 00:23:00,812
I will ask you a series of questions

412
00:23:00,847 --> 00:23:03,548
designed to root out
all pretenders to the throne.

413
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:06,551
Only a true High King
will hold the answers

414
00:23:06,586 --> 00:23:08,720
in his heart.

415
00:23:11,158 --> 00:23:14,526
Come at me.

416
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:18,663
What popular American
television program

417
00:23:18,699 --> 00:23:21,633
stars actor Tim Daly?

418
00:23:21,668 --> 00:23:23,068
What the fuck?

419
00:23:23,103 --> 00:23:25,003
He was in a lot of TV shows.

420
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:26,838
There is only one correct answer.

421
00:23:26,873 --> 00:23:28,707
Okay.
Give me the next question.

422
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:33,211
This hit single
is performed by offspring

423
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:34,946
of famous entertainers.

424
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:37,716
Dude, that is crazy vague.

425
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:39,918
You will receive a single hint.

426
00:23:39,953 --> 00:23:42,821
Your hint is Beach Boys.

427
00:23:42,856 --> 00:23:46,257
"Hold On" by Wilson Phillips.

428
00:23:46,293 --> 00:23:47,926
That song is my jam.

429
00:23:47,961 --> 00:23:50,829
Wait, all these questions
are from the '90s.

430
00:23:50,864 --> 00:23:53,598
It--it's not the 1990s
on Earth right now?

431
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:55,400
No, it--it's 2017.

432
00:23:55,435 --> 00:23:59,337
Oh, and it's, uh, "Wings,"
the--the Tim Daly show. "Wings."

433
00:23:59,373 --> 00:24:03,675
- Of course you know that.
- Okay, '90s.

434
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,344
Ask me something
about Patrick Swayze.

435
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,313
You know of Swayze?

436
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:20,658
Ahem.

437
00:24:20,694 --> 00:24:22,293
"Sorry about the disruption, folks,

438
00:24:22,329 --> 00:24:25,230
"but I always do the last dance
of the season.

439
00:24:25,265 --> 00:24:27,165
"This year somebody told me not to.

440
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,367
"So I'm gonna do my kind of dancing

441
00:24:29,403 --> 00:24:30,935
"with a great partner,

442
00:24:30,971 --> 00:24:33,538
"who's not only a terrific dancer.

443
00:24:33,573 --> 00:24:36,307
"Somebody who's taught me

444
00:24:36,343 --> 00:24:38,309
"that there are people out there
willing to stand up

445
00:24:38,345 --> 00:24:41,880
"for other people
no matter what it costs them.

446
00:24:41,915 --> 00:24:46,084
"Somebody who's taught me

447
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:49,821
"about the kind of person
I want to be.

448
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:51,589
Miss Frances Houseman."

449
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:55,994
Oh, Your Majesty.

450
00:24:56,029 --> 00:24:59,964
The crowns of Fillory are yours.

451
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:17,914
So I guess we just put them on.

452
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:19,282
No, God, stop.

453
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:23,353
I mean, I just--
we should do a-a ceremony.

454
00:25:23,388 --> 00:25:25,322
This is only gonna happen once.

455
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,324
We are becoming kings and queens,

456
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:33,063
so...it's important
and we should honor it.

457
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:37,467
Just give me that.

458
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:40,403
Kneel, Eliot Waugh.

459
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:43,807
Would you just do it?
It's gonna be quick, I promise.

460
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:52,782
So, destiny is--
it's bullshit.

461
00:25:52,818 --> 00:25:55,752
But you are High King in your blood.

462
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,854
And somehow that makes sense,
you know?

463
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,856
And I-I just--
for what it's worth,

464
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:03,660
I think that you are going to be
a really good king.

465
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:08,532
Um, so, um,
I-I dub thee,

466
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,901
um, I don't know.

467
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:13,303
Would you say, like,
you're more brave or merciful?

468
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:15,906
I'd say I'm neither.

469
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:19,409
But I still plan to be
a spectacular monarch.

470
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:21,878
I hereby dub thee

471
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,814
High King Eliot

472
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,384
the Spectacular.

473
00:26:30,822 --> 00:26:34,791
Wow, uh,

474
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:37,961
this feels as natural as underwear.

475
00:26:42,234 --> 00:26:45,669
Thank you.

476
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:48,471
By the power vested in me by...

477
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:51,608
I have no idea,

478
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:54,911
I do hereby crown you

479
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:58,548
High Queen Margo

480
00:26:58,584 --> 00:26:59,950
the Destroyer.

481
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:01,785
I mean that
in the best possible sense.

482
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:06,289
Uh, all hail.
Everyone clap.

483
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:14,497
I have known what you truly are

484
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:17,434
since the day we met.

485
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,603
Long may you reign.

486
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:31,881
I feel it's incumbent upon me

487
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:36,419
to promise never again
to betray you like I did.

488
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:41,024
I really--
really am sorry.

489
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:45,595
I have some character defects.
I'm working on it.

490
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:47,764
Honestly.

491
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:57,407
I'm working on some too.

492
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:59,809
Well, on that note,

493
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:03,980
I crown you Queen Alice

494
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,749
the Wise.

495
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:17,627
No, wait.

496
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:20,797
Since we're cleaning slates
and shit, give me.

497
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:27,604
Q.

498
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:31,775
Uh, I could start
by saying something cruel

499
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:34,577
yet totally hilarious about you.

500
00:28:34,613 --> 00:28:39,215
Let's be real, you're an easy target.

501
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:40,984
But that's--

502
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:44,521
well, that's because you're
honest about what you love.

503
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,090
And underneath it all, that's...

504
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,526
inspiring.

505
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:53,196
And I'm sorry too.

506
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,597
Not about the sex,

507
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:57,400
I don't even really remember it.

508
00:28:57,436 --> 00:29:00,804
Mostly my part in fucking up
something that was good for you.

509
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:04,207
Thanks, I think
I fucked it up just fine myself.

510
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,509
Now that we're ruling
a kingdom together,

511
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:08,945
I hope we can be
whatever we were again.

512
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,648
I guess you could call that friends.

513
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:13,917
Let's go with that.

514
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:17,620
I hereby crown you King Quentin

515
00:29:17,656 --> 00:29:22,826
the Moderately Socially Maladjusted.

516
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:25,995
- Scrunch down.
- Yeah.

517
00:29:36,675 --> 00:29:39,209
Royalty, bitches.

518
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:52,722
Okay.

519
00:29:58,163 --> 00:30:01,231
Shit.

520
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:05,468
Hey, everything okay?

521
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:06,669
I'm going back to the Torrent.

522
00:30:06,705 --> 00:30:08,538
You think that guy
did something to you

523
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:10,673
'cause you were a raging douche?

524
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:12,308
I'll sweet-talk him.

525
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:14,911
Get him to fix my hands, then--
then I'll head to the castle.

526
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:17,080
Everything's under control.

527
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,963
Alice.

528
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:39,102
Apology accepted.

529
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:43,573
That was you apologizing
for what you did.

530
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:45,308
I just--

531
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:48,778
if we survive this,
I hope we can be friends still.

532
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:55,285
I know it may sound stupid,

533
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,854
but that's what I'm mad at you for,

534
00:30:57,889 --> 00:31:01,424
not--not the cheating part.

535
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:07,030
The part where what you did
made me lose you.

536
00:31:07,065 --> 00:31:09,132
And you're a big part
of my life, Quentin.

537
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:13,369
You can never lose me, Alice.

538
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:15,438
I mean, you can avoid me,
you can hate me--

539
00:31:15,474 --> 00:31:17,740
I don't hate you.

540
00:31:17,776 --> 00:31:20,543
Well, you can't lose me.

541
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:22,712
Sorry.

542
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:31,087
I just--
I can't stop thinking.

543
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:33,857
We're gonna find
this epic spell, great.

544
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:38,228
But I'm afraid I'm just gonna...

545
00:31:38,263 --> 00:31:40,330
freeze again when The Beast
is in front of me.

546
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:43,066
You're thinking about it wrong.

547
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:44,541
Cool under pressure is not a talent.

548
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,836
It's a--it's a skill,
and you need to practice.

549
00:31:46,872 --> 00:31:51,207
You--come on.

550
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:53,443
We stood on a roof together
during the Trials,

551
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:54,844
and you told me that you were
afraid to see

552
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,681
what you're really capable of.

553
00:31:58,717 --> 00:32:01,985
That was then.

554
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,687
So let's see what you can do now.

555
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:06,823
I'm not sure it'll help.

556
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:08,858
Then do it for me.
I'm not gonna lie.

557
00:32:08,894 --> 00:32:12,295
I--I'm dying to see
what you can do.

558
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:16,966
I'm not a Naturalist.

559
00:32:17,002 --> 00:32:18,601
You know the spell, we all do.

560
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:20,770
We just sucked at it.

561
00:32:24,843 --> 00:32:26,976
Let's see what you can do now.

562
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:44,694
Oh.
That feels...

563
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:48,898
it's just like breathing.

564
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:52,068
See?
Nice.

565
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:21,397
So how do you feel now?

566
00:33:39,284 --> 00:33:41,584
We're not getting back together.

567
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,820
Okay.

568
00:33:55,746 --> 00:33:58,113
I've been wondering something.

569
00:33:58,148 --> 00:34:00,916
Why didn't Reynard kill you
with your friends?

570
00:34:00,951 --> 00:34:02,884
Why were you spared?

571
00:34:13,264 --> 00:34:15,030
You weren't spared, were you?

572
00:34:15,065 --> 00:34:17,199
Look, let's not go there, okay?

573
00:34:17,234 --> 00:34:19,468
You know, when I was a boy,

574
00:34:19,503 --> 00:34:21,770
a man who was meant to care for me

575
00:34:21,805 --> 00:34:24,940
bent me over his desk
and had me over and over

576
00:34:24,975 --> 00:34:27,676
every time I was alone with him.

577
00:34:27,711 --> 00:34:30,379
It helps me understand a truth.

578
00:34:30,414 --> 00:34:33,915
You're powerful or you're weak.

579
00:34:33,951 --> 00:34:37,719
If you're powerful, you will survive.

580
00:34:37,755 --> 00:34:40,555
So what, you're suggesting
I just get over it?

581
00:34:40,591 --> 00:34:42,724
Actually, yes.

582
00:34:45,529 --> 00:34:49,064
How?
Mutate?

583
00:34:49,099 --> 00:34:50,299
Take over a world,

584
00:34:50,334 --> 00:34:51,833
kill a bunch of grad students
39 times?

585
00:34:51,869 --> 00:34:56,305
Eh, see, what you feel,

586
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,440
the haunted look in your eyes,

587
00:34:58,475 --> 00:35:03,078
doesn't come from nowhere.

588
00:35:03,113 --> 00:35:05,347
Then where does it come from?

589
00:35:05,382 --> 00:35:07,182
In the center of your being,

590
00:35:07,217 --> 00:35:11,386
there's a tiny beating heart.

591
00:35:11,422 --> 00:35:13,488
What, you mean like my soul?

592
00:35:13,524 --> 00:35:16,091
Part of it, yes, the slimmest part,

593
00:35:16,126 --> 00:35:19,227
but it holds specific power.

594
00:35:19,263 --> 00:35:21,396
It's called a Shade.

595
00:35:21,432 --> 00:35:23,865
Shade.

596
00:35:23,901 --> 00:35:26,001
It's what makes you feel

597
00:35:26,036 --> 00:35:30,072
the pain will burn you
till there's nothing.

598
00:35:30,107 --> 00:35:32,407
And, yes, it's also there for love,

599
00:35:32,443 --> 00:35:34,242
but, uh, let's be frank, darling,

600
00:35:34,278 --> 00:35:36,311
you're more likely
to throw yourself off a bridge

601
00:35:36,347 --> 00:35:41,216
than ever love again.

602
00:35:41,251 --> 00:35:43,852
I felt that way.

603
00:35:43,887 --> 00:35:47,956
And I knew it crippled me
when I needed to be strong.

604
00:35:47,991 --> 00:35:49,925
As you do now.

605
00:35:56,667 --> 00:35:58,800
You know...

606
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:05,374
I don't care for people, as a rule.

607
00:36:11,882 --> 00:36:14,683
I like you.

608
00:36:14,718 --> 00:36:16,084
You have promise.

609
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:20,655
With the right control,
you would be formidable.

610
00:36:20,691 --> 00:36:25,160
Even a worthy collaborator.

611
00:36:25,195 --> 00:36:28,530
I have plans.
You could be part of them.

612
00:36:31,301 --> 00:36:33,535
- If?
- Do what I did.

613
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:36,638
Sever your shade.

614
00:36:36,673 --> 00:36:39,841
- Sever.
- It's not hard.

615
00:36:39,877 --> 00:36:42,744
You'll feel better.

616
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,347
You'll feel happy.

617
00:36:45,382 --> 00:36:47,516
I can show you how.

618
00:36:50,053 --> 00:36:52,821
No, thank you.

619
00:36:52,856 --> 00:36:55,991
Do let me know
if you change your mind.

620
00:37:47,978 --> 00:37:49,678
Eliot!

621
00:37:49,713 --> 00:37:52,147
The crown suits you, of course.

622
00:37:52,182 --> 00:37:54,349
- Who are all these people?
- The Pickwick family.

623
00:37:54,384 --> 00:37:56,985
They've been running things
till Children of Earth came.

624
00:38:00,057 --> 00:38:01,122
Your Highness.

625
00:38:01,158 --> 00:38:02,924
Tick Pickwick
of the Northern Marsh Pickwicks,

626
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,192
at your service.

627
00:38:04,228 --> 00:38:06,495
The rest of the King's Council
will arrive shortly.

628
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:09,531
- Great.
- So glad you're here.

629
00:38:09,566 --> 00:38:11,500
There are a few problems.

630
00:38:11,535 --> 00:38:13,401
Uh, several problems

631
00:38:13,437 --> 00:38:14,903
that could use
your immediate attention.

632
00:38:14,938 --> 00:38:17,606
Ah, okay, great.
We should probably get started.

633
00:38:17,641 --> 00:38:19,841
First, your throne room.

634
00:38:19,877 --> 00:38:21,409
I'm afraid it's been locked
a long time.

635
00:38:21,445 --> 00:38:23,111
- We're looking for the key.
- That's fine.

636
00:38:23,146 --> 00:38:26,281
Uh, take me straight to the Armory.

637
00:39:02,986 --> 00:39:07,756
The Armory, your, uh, highnesses.

638
00:39:07,791 --> 00:39:09,925
Well, this is underwhelming.

639
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:13,094
This is supposed to be full of books.

640
00:39:15,933 --> 00:39:19,534
"Strategies for Trapping
Tomato-eating Garden Fairies."

641
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:21,570
Yeah, no.

642
00:39:21,605 --> 00:39:23,238
Someone took all the battle magic.

643
00:39:23,273 --> 00:39:26,007
It's not like The Beast
is coming to find us any second.

644
00:39:26,043 --> 00:39:28,143
Wait, this is something.

645
00:39:28,178 --> 00:39:31,413
It's an--it's a workbook
on spells, serious ones.

646
00:39:31,448 --> 00:39:33,148
Looks like battle magic.

647
00:39:33,183 --> 00:39:35,016
But the actual spells aren't here.

648
00:39:35,052 --> 00:39:38,553
Hmm, like notes on cake,
but no actual recipes.

649
00:39:38,589 --> 00:39:40,655
That's helpful.

650
00:39:40,691 --> 00:39:43,458
Who wrote it?

651
00:39:43,493 --> 00:39:45,627
- Oh, my God.
- What?

652
00:39:45,662 --> 00:39:47,796
I know where we need to go.

653
00:39:50,233 --> 00:39:51,733
Brakebills?

654
00:39:55,721 --> 00:39:59,481
Hello?
Mr., uh, Mr.--

655
00:40:03,225 --> 00:40:06,726
Fuck!

656
00:40:06,762 --> 00:40:09,229
Can I help you?

657
00:40:09,264 --> 00:40:11,514
Hell, yes, you can.
These don't work.

658
00:40:11,634 --> 00:40:13,074
Well, by all means, request a refund.

659
00:40:13,102 --> 00:40:15,336
Very funny.
You did this on purpose.

660
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:18,305
Did what? Help an ungrateful
Child of Earth?

661
00:40:18,341 --> 00:40:19,782
Look, I'll pay you
whatever you want, okay?

662
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:21,050
I'm--I'm serious, okay?

663
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,518
I'm friends
with the kings and queens.

664
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:24,453
You want to be a duke,
great, I got you--

665
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:26,855
Actions have consequences, Penny.

666
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:29,792
Even glib words spoken
in casual arrogance.

667
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:31,894
It's past time you learned,

668
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,196
especially give the position
you'll occupy soon.

669
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:35,264
What position?

670
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:37,132
You know what?
I've done you a service.

671
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:39,234
No, no,
Look, hey, I'm--

672
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,904
I'm sorry, okay?

673
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:45,074
Please fix my hands.

674
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:48,377
See, how do I put this
in a way that you'll understand?

675
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:52,381
Ah, go fuck yourself.

676
00:40:52,416 --> 00:40:56,018
No, wait!

677
00:40:56,053 --> 00:40:57,987
Fuck!

678
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:03,659
Hang on to this while I'm gone.

679
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:06,462
Oh.

680
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:08,263
You guys all packed?

681
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:12,067
Yeah.

682
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:14,837
El, thank you.

683
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:17,539
For what?
For, um, taking one for the team

684
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:19,708
to the tune of the rest of my life?

685
00:41:21,412 --> 00:41:24,446
I'm trying to see this ruling thing

686
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,782
as an adventure.

687
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,385
Apparently we have enemies
to the north and south.

688
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:33,489
Plus broken infrastructure
and huge magic issues

689
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:36,325
thanks to The Beast
and his Wellspring addiction.

690
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,228
And do you know they don't know
what champagne is here?

691
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:43,098
I plan on inventing it.

692
00:41:43,134 --> 00:41:44,967
I'd like to be known as...

693
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:48,504
the Champagne King.

694
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:49,672
It has a ring to it.

695
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:51,240
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

696
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:54,343
I'm really looking forward
to drinking socially,

697
00:41:54,378 --> 00:41:56,311
like the French.

698
00:42:01,419 --> 00:42:04,953
So, uh, in the books,

699
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:07,556
time doesn't exactly run
the same speed

700
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:11,226
on Earth as in Fillory.

701
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:12,795
I mean, look, sometimes it got screwy

702
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:15,698
when Jane and Martin
would go back and forth.

703
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:17,866
But not always.

704
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:22,037
It's gonna be fine.

705
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:25,708
Yeah.

706
00:42:25,743 --> 00:42:27,142
Yeah.

707
00:42:27,178 --> 00:42:29,945
Or I'll just live out my days

708
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:34,149
waiting for my friends
to return and die alone.

709
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:43,392
You know, it's considered
extremely disrespectful

710
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:46,762
to touch a king without permission.

711
00:42:49,033 --> 00:42:52,835
But, um, I think you should...

712
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:56,004
probably hug me right now.

713
00:43:05,216 --> 00:43:06,915
It'll also be okay if you just

714
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:09,518
give my ass, like, a little squeeze.

715
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:16,792
Feel free to, uh, double-check
this before I get started.

716
00:43:16,827 --> 00:43:18,961
Julia?

717
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:33,809
Why do you want to help me

718
00:43:33,844 --> 00:43:36,678
with my Shade?

719
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:38,180
Without your Shade,

720
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:42,851
you would see
a lot of things differently.

721
00:43:42,887 --> 00:43:46,688
You'd be able to live, Julia.

722
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:48,724
Come here.

723
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:50,893
Let me show you.

724
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:25,160
- We're there.
- Put it back.

725
00:44:25,196 --> 00:44:28,664
It's okay, it's okay.

726
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:31,733
I need it.

727
00:44:31,769 --> 00:44:34,903
Put it back now, Martin.

728
00:44:36,307 --> 00:44:38,574
Suit yourself.

729
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:01,163
I understand why you're afraid.

730
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,699
You don't want to lose yourself.

731
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:05,934
But hear me on this.

732
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:07,736
Martyring yourself to your pain

733
00:45:07,771 --> 00:45:09,238
isn't all it's advertised to be.

734
00:45:09,273 --> 00:45:12,274
It'll destroy you.

735
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:15,711
There's no glory in that.

736
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:19,581
You might get Reynard, yes.

737
00:45:19,617 --> 00:45:22,684
But he'll still win.

738
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,686
Anyways.

739
00:45:36,214 --> 00:45:47,292
