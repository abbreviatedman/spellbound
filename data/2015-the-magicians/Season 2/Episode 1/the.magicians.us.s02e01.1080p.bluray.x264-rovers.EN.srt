1
00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:04,570
<i>- Previously on
"The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:04,572 --> 00:00:05,971
We summoned some kind of killer
moth man from another world.

3
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:07,506
My friends who got separated
and I just...

4
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:09,141
I can't let them fight
the beast on their own.

5
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:10,909
<i>- You want me to come
to Fillory with you?</i>

6
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:12,745
- All right, so there might be
a solution here, a weapon.

7
00:00:12,747 --> 00:00:14,113
<i>It's something that
if we could find it,</i>

8
00:00:14,115 --> 00:00:15,614
<i>we could use it
to kill the beast.</i>

9
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:17,282
- Payment is due.
- Apparently marriage here

10
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:19,485
- is different.
- I can never leave Fillory.

11
00:00:19,487 --> 00:00:21,487
- I have gifted you my bestowal,

12
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:23,622
<i>when you are ready
to face the beast.</i>

13
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:24,857
<i>Imbibe it.</i>

14
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:26,325
- We followed all the clues.

15
00:00:26,327 --> 00:00:28,861
<i>We thought
that she was leading us to her.</i>

16
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:30,529
<i>We summoned her.</i>

17
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:33,966
You know, I actually believed
our lady underground chose me.

18
00:00:33,968 --> 00:00:36,168
<i>- You may address me
as Reynard the fox,</i>

19
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,971
trickster of the faithful,
the pure of heart,

20
00:00:38,973 --> 00:00:42,875
the very stupid.

21
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:44,810
- Hi, Martin.

22
00:00:52,186 --> 00:00:54,219
- Ahh!

23
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,454
- Wait.

24
00:00:55,456 --> 00:00:56,688
You know how to deal with gods.

25
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,957
You know how to fuck up
their shit.

26
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:01,293
- I want to make a deal.
- Let's.

27
00:01:17,078 --> 00:01:22,714
<i>- * We learned how *</i>

28
00:01:22,716 --> 00:01:25,150
- help!

29
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:27,986
-<i> * On our own *</i>

30
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:31,223
- somebody!

31
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:38,397
-<i> * Never needing *</i>

32
00:01:40,034 --> 00:01:42,167
-<i> * Help from you *</i>

33
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:43,902
- there's gotta be someone

34
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:47,739
in this motherfucking
goddamn magical forest.

35
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:49,174
-<i> * Reaching out *</i>

36
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:51,009
- get up.

37
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:55,247
People are dying.

38
00:01:55,249 --> 00:01:59,184
-<i> * With eyes closed *</i>

39
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:07,259
<i>* we felt the light *</i>

40
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:14,399
-<i> * It taught us to grow *</i>

41
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,207
- hungry, I assume?

42
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:25,410
After all that being chased?

43
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:27,112
- No, um, I'm not being chased.

44
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:30,215
- Oh.
- Usually they're being chased.

45
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:33,785
- That I know of, no.

46
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:37,756
- But you do need
some kind of help.

47
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,658
- Uh, it's just where
I come from there's a legend

48
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:43,162
about a witch
with a cottage made of candy.

49
00:02:43,164 --> 00:02:44,596
- Well, the cottage
is mostly wood,

50
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:47,166
and I'm more of a healer and...

51
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,001
Gardening enthusiast.

52
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:52,271
- Okay.

53
00:02:52,273 --> 00:02:53,672
I need your help.

54
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:56,175
- And you're offering...?

55
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:59,411
- Offering? Um...
- Gold... Is always good.

56
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:01,613
- You would be helping
the next high king of Fillory.

57
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:03,081
- Okay.

58
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,950
Then my discount rate.

59
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:06,185
One vial.

60
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:08,020
- Vial of what?

61
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:09,454
- Were you dropped on your head
as a child?

62
00:03:09,456 --> 00:03:13,091
Your blood, dum-dum.

63
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:23,168
- There you are.

64
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:26,338
We were so worried.

65
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,407
- You're, uh...

66
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:36,181
- God-powered.

67
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:39,251
So it's a little hard
to kill me at the moment.

68
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,790
- Ahh!

69
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:47,459
- Thank god.

70
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:50,362
I mean, you know,

71
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:53,432
thank god, Alice.

72
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:00,005
- I hesitated.

73
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:01,707
With the beast,
I should have... it's...

74
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:02,908
It's my fault.

75
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,909
- No, it's not, I...

76
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:05,310
- no, he's right.

77
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:06,311
It's Julia's fault.

78
00:04:06,313 --> 00:04:07,679
- No, guys.

79
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:10,048
- She... she's not sane.
- You think?

80
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,416
- One small consolation

81
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,185
is the bitch is
with the beast right now,

82
00:04:13,187 --> 00:04:15,153
and I can't really see
that going her way.

83
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:18,523
- No, it, uh,
I'll explain it in a second.

84
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:21,226
Um, can I have
my blood back, please?

85
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:24,096
- Look, my friends,
they're fine.

86
00:04:24,098 --> 00:04:26,698
- I don't need your...
- no.

87
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,868
I took an hour out of my night.

88
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,070
You're in Fillory, magician.

89
00:04:32,072 --> 00:04:34,273
Be careful with strangers.

90
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:37,009
We only look whimsical.

91
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:43,215
- Who was that?
- Uh, a local.

92
00:04:43,217 --> 00:04:46,451
- Okay, fuckers, huddle up.

93
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:48,120
Zillion bucks says the beast
comes back any minute,

94
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:49,554
so what's the plan?

95
00:04:49,556 --> 00:04:52,758
- We lost the blade,
so we need a new something.

96
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,227
Um, especially while Alice
is still...

97
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:56,795
- Juiced up?
- We should all juice up.

98
00:04:56,797 --> 00:05:00,132
Like the beast.
Wellspring smoothies, stat.

99
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:13,211
- Ahh!
- Shit.

100
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:15,380
- There's a missing piece
right there.

101
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:17,316
- Oh, hey, I think I...
- Uh, yeah.

102
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:19,718
Ahh!

103
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,986
- This is going great.

104
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,055
- Let me try.

105
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:33,665
- Wow, swallowing has
its privileges.

106
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,488
- Wow, it looks like...
- A major drought's hit.

107
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,557
- There's a bucket.

108
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:07,332
Shit.

109
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,639
I knew the beast came here
every day, but is it...

110
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:16,108
But is it even possible for him

111
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,709
to drain the wellspring
that much?

112
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,378
- He really threw something
out of whack.

113
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,012
- I vote we don't touch it
on the grounds

114
00:06:21,014 --> 00:06:22,881
that exploding Fillory
wouldn't help.

115
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,282
- Okay.
- We need a new plan.

116
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:26,184
- What plan?
- The beast is gone.

117
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:29,020
Our squad is a joke.
What plan, exactly?

118
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:30,655
- We'll figure it out.
- We always do.

119
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:32,457
- When it's a final to cheat on,

120
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:34,693
not when we're stuck
in some epic fantasy

121
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:39,164
that likes to behead its heroes
halfway through season one.

122
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:42,734
If we even are heroes.

123
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,804
We might be comic relief.

124
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,841
I thought you threw that out.

125
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:52,911
- It's for emergencies.
- Pass it around.

126
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:56,748
- Okay.
- No wellspring, no knife.

127
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,050
- I have no idea what to do now.

128
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:00,919
- So we are fucked
without grease.

129
00:07:00,921 --> 00:07:04,756
- That sounds like us.
- Must be a Monday.

130
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,825
Onward to glory.

131
00:07:23,907 --> 00:07:26,975
- Ah, much better.

132
00:07:29,335 --> 00:07:30,836
- Why are... are we...

133
00:07:30,838 --> 00:07:32,871
- ah, the food is tremendous.

134
00:07:32,873 --> 00:07:36,475
Let's sit.

135
00:07:36,477 --> 00:07:39,711
- You familiar?
- Word as bond?

136
00:07:39,713 --> 00:07:42,881
Uh, I assume the extra bits
enchant the blade

137
00:07:42,883 --> 00:07:44,683
to kill me instantly

138
00:07:44,685 --> 00:07:48,220
in the event I break it, eh.

139
00:07:48,222 --> 00:07:49,988
- Okay, here's the deal...

140
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,691
- you need to kill a god.

141
00:07:52,693 --> 00:07:54,860
Thrilling.

142
00:07:54,862 --> 00:07:56,728
So you need to get near him.

143
00:07:56,730 --> 00:08:00,365
- Tricky.
- Yes, but you can help.

144
00:08:00,367 --> 00:08:02,434
- Mm.

145
00:08:02,436 --> 00:08:05,704
- His... Name
is Reynard the fox.

146
00:08:05,706 --> 00:08:08,841
- A trickster of some sorts,
yes?

147
00:08:08,843 --> 00:08:10,876
Oh, that will be a challenge.

148
00:08:10,878 --> 00:08:13,045
- Well, you don't really have
much choice, do you?

149
00:08:13,047 --> 00:08:16,448
- Oh, well aware you have
that stylish little blade.

150
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,717
- I sure do.

151
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:21,253
- That reminds me to insist
the terms of our deal

152
00:08:21,255 --> 00:08:23,689
include said blade
reverting to me

153
00:08:23,691 --> 00:08:26,058
at the moment
of Reynard's demise.

154
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,393
- Agreed?
- Almost.

155
00:08:28,395 --> 00:08:30,229
First, for the duration
of our agreement,

156
00:08:30,231 --> 00:08:32,464
you do not hurt
or act against me in any way.

157
00:08:32,466 --> 00:08:35,767
- Mm, fine.

158
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:38,403
- Quentin, all of them.

159
00:08:38,405 --> 00:08:41,440
You lay a finger,

160
00:08:41,442 --> 00:08:45,711
this will put this

161
00:08:45,713 --> 00:08:49,248
in the base of your skull.

162
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,883
- You're not what I expected.

163
00:08:50,885 --> 00:08:54,219
- Once Reynard is dead,
I put the knife down.

164
00:08:54,221 --> 00:08:56,588
Yours to take.

165
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:59,291
- So this Reynard's
still out there?

166
00:08:59,293 --> 00:09:00,993
- As far as she knows.

167
00:09:00,995 --> 00:09:02,594
Yeah, it's why she needed
the knife

168
00:09:02,596 --> 00:09:04,129
and why she needs the beast.

169
00:09:04,131 --> 00:09:06,398
- Okay, I get it now,
but I also have to say

170
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,268
that is the dumbest thing
she could possibly have done.

171
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,904
- Like I said,
she's not sane right now.

172
00:09:11,906 --> 00:09:13,572
- I wouldn't be.
- So what are we supposed to do?

173
00:09:13,574 --> 00:09:15,641
- Kill the beast.
- He's right.

174
00:09:15,643 --> 00:09:17,109
You know, it's awful,

175
00:09:17,111 --> 00:09:18,911
but she chose
to double cross us.

176
00:09:18,913 --> 00:09:21,580
- Look, I'm pissed too,
but I would like to point out...

177
00:09:21,582 --> 00:09:23,348
- okay, we don't have to take
a vote right this second.

178
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,150
Penny's right.
First things first.

179
00:09:25,152 --> 00:09:27,819
We need to make a plan
to deal with the beast.

180
00:09:27,821 --> 00:09:29,454
- Eliot!

181
00:09:29,456 --> 00:09:30,856
I thought for sure you...

182
00:09:30,858 --> 00:09:33,759
- yeah, me too.
- Not yet.

183
00:09:33,761 --> 00:09:36,261
- Are... are you all right?

184
00:09:36,263 --> 00:09:39,198
Um, I'll... I'll get everyone
something to eat.

185
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,266
- That would be amazing.

186
00:09:43,503 --> 00:09:47,139
I think I like her.

187
00:09:47,141 --> 00:09:49,208
I hope I like her.

188
00:09:54,881 --> 00:09:57,382
- Um, okay.
- This might be something.

189
00:09:57,384 --> 00:10:00,986
Um, so there's a-a-a place

190
00:10:00,988 --> 00:10:02,454
called the armory.

191
00:10:02,456 --> 00:10:04,723
- Weapons?
- Books.

192
00:10:04,725 --> 00:10:07,826
Uh, so Rupert Chatwin,

193
00:10:07,828 --> 00:10:10,629
uh, he realizes that back home,

194
00:10:10,631 --> 00:10:11,997
world war ii is still raging

195
00:10:11,999 --> 00:10:14,566
and he tells Jane and Martin
that he is going...

196
00:10:14,568 --> 00:10:17,369
He's... he's going to go fight.
Before he does,

197
00:10:17,371 --> 00:10:20,472
uh, he spends all night
in the armory reading.

198
00:10:20,474 --> 00:10:23,308
Uh, and, uh, you know,
like, whatever he finds,

199
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:25,677
it doesn't say,

200
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:30,148
but his next move
is to petition ember and umber

201
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,750
for strength.

202
00:10:31,752 --> 00:10:33,552
I mean, what...
What if he found something.

203
00:10:33,554 --> 00:10:35,887
What if he found, uh, a spell

204
00:10:35,889 --> 00:10:39,491
or a piece of, I don't know,
Fillorian battle magic

205
00:10:39,493 --> 00:10:41,360
that was so strong
that he couldn't do it without...

206
00:10:41,362 --> 00:10:43,061
- Without juice?
- Yeah, because the...

207
00:10:43,063 --> 00:10:45,897
Okay, the thing is this is, uh,

208
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:49,568
December, 1944.

209
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,270
I mean, he shows up
right in the middle of the...

210
00:10:51,272 --> 00:10:55,173
- battle of the bulge.

211
00:10:55,175 --> 00:10:58,677
Wait, are you saying
that Rupert secretly...

212
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:01,346
- I'm saying...
- Uh,

213
00:11:01,348 --> 00:11:05,617
maybe he found something
powerful enough to help.

214
00:11:05,619 --> 00:11:07,686
- And win world war ii?

215
00:11:07,688 --> 00:11:11,423
- Maybe.

216
00:11:11,425 --> 00:11:13,859
- Well then, I need the armory.
- Where is it?

217
00:11:13,861 --> 00:11:17,429
- Castle Whitespire.
- Accessible to...

218
00:11:17,431 --> 00:11:18,430
The king.

219
00:11:18,432 --> 00:11:20,866
- Oh, hey.

220
00:11:20,868 --> 00:11:23,402
- And if we can find
the road, there's, um,

221
00:11:23,404 --> 00:11:26,071
a carriage that runs
in a continuous circle, uh,

222
00:11:26,073 --> 00:11:28,573
also at the disposal
of the king, so...

223
00:11:28,575 --> 00:11:32,144
- Okay.
- Whitespire it is.

224
00:11:32,146 --> 00:11:35,213
Come on, everybody.
Grab snacks.

225
00:11:35,215 --> 00:11:36,948
- Yeah, uh, about that.

226
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,150
My hands are in a fucking box,

227
00:11:38,152 --> 00:11:40,719
so Chatwin's torrent.

228
00:11:40,721 --> 00:11:43,588
- I-i know that one.
- It's, um, it's a healing river.

229
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,791
- Can it reattach hands?
- Maybe.

230
00:11:45,793 --> 00:11:48,060
- I'm going.
- I'll catch you on the flip.

231
00:11:48,062 --> 00:11:49,928
- Wait, no, I don't think
you should be going alone.

232
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:53,732
- I'll go.
- Um, healing water?

233
00:11:53,734 --> 00:11:56,802
We're going to battle.
I'll grab, like, a gallon.

234
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:03,308
You're wiping your own ass,
so figure that out.

235
00:12:15,788 --> 00:12:18,323
- Souvenir?
- Barometer.

236
00:12:18,325 --> 00:12:22,160
Thought I should pay attention
to see if it gets warm.

237
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,000
- Whoa. Hey, guys.

238
00:12:29,002 --> 00:12:30,802
Hey, over here!

239
00:12:30,804 --> 00:12:32,804
- Oh, my god,
those horses are so beautiful.

240
00:12:32,806 --> 00:12:34,539
- Uh, hey.
- What are you doing?

241
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:37,042
- I just really love horses.
- Come on.

242
00:12:37,044 --> 00:12:38,377
- Hup!

243
00:12:40,847 --> 00:12:43,315
- You have got to be kidding me.

244
00:12:43,317 --> 00:12:45,350
- I know, those horses
were so rude.

245
00:12:45,352 --> 00:12:46,852
- I guess they're a tad literal.

246
00:12:46,854 --> 00:12:48,887
- Yeah. I'd call needing to see
an actual crown

247
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:50,722
on my head
as pretty goddamn literal.

248
00:12:50,724 --> 00:12:53,058
- Look, it's not just
about the carriage.

249
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:54,893
They're not gonna let us
in to Whitespire

250
00:12:54,895 --> 00:12:56,895
until you've been crowned
high king, so...

251
00:12:56,897 --> 00:13:00,198
- We... we need to get you
crowned.

252
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,135
Uh...

253
00:13:03,137 --> 00:13:05,404
Okay, yeah.
Um, so there's a...

254
00:13:05,406 --> 00:13:08,907
There's a specific
coronation place

255
00:13:08,909 --> 00:13:10,709
in the forest.

256
00:13:10,711 --> 00:13:12,244
- There are four kings
and queens.

257
00:13:12,246 --> 00:13:16,882
- Yeah, you get to pick
the other three.

258
00:13:16,884 --> 00:13:18,350
Do I get to be a king?

259
00:13:18,352 --> 00:13:20,085
- Unless you want me
to pick penny.

260
00:13:21,588 --> 00:13:23,755
- So, okay, so we get
to the coronation spot

261
00:13:23,757 --> 00:13:25,824
by crossing the rainbow bridge.

262
00:13:25,826 --> 00:13:28,894
- Rainbow bridge? Like where
family pets go when they die?

263
00:13:28,896 --> 00:13:30,929
- No. I mean,
not that I know of.

264
00:13:30,931 --> 00:13:33,398
No, it's called that because of
the flowers that are everywhere.

265
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,700
- Oh.
- Um, but there is, of course,

266
00:13:35,702 --> 00:13:37,502
no map,

267
00:13:37,504 --> 00:13:40,772
but I know Martin found it
with a spell.

268
00:13:40,774 --> 00:13:44,543
- Well, we could always
just ask around.

269
00:13:44,545 --> 00:13:47,212
- Or we could make like Martin.

270
00:14:02,462 --> 00:14:04,029
He loves me.

271
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,564
He loves me not.

272
00:14:05,566 --> 00:14:07,933
He loves me.

273
00:14:07,935 --> 00:14:10,135
He loves me not.

274
00:14:10,137 --> 00:14:13,205
Uh, he loves me.
Let's go.

275
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:27,586
- Ah.

276
00:14:27,588 --> 00:14:30,622
Uh, please know
I heard every loophole.

277
00:14:30,624 --> 00:14:33,391
"Put the knife down."

278
00:14:33,393 --> 00:14:36,228
You really think
you have a fighting chance?

279
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:39,130
- I think I'm gonna
give it my best.

280
00:14:39,132 --> 00:14:41,967
- Oh, this is going to be fun.

281
00:14:45,105 --> 00:14:47,606
- Nice of Reynard to pull
so many hearts out of chests.

282
00:14:47,608 --> 00:14:52,044
It's, uh, distinctive.

283
00:14:53,046 --> 00:14:55,346
Why do you suppose he does that?

284
00:14:55,348 --> 00:15:00,184
- He likes the taste.
- Mm.

285
00:15:00,186 --> 00:15:03,120
Brilliant, that, uh, laptop.

286
00:15:03,122 --> 00:15:05,890
The things they come up with
when they don't have magic.

287
00:15:05,892 --> 00:15:09,026
- Yeah, like accounts that tweet
police scanner activity.

288
00:15:09,028 --> 00:15:10,428
- "Tweet"?

289
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:13,798
Birds have computer accounts?

290
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,033
- Don't worry about it.

291
00:15:16,035 --> 00:15:19,603
- Mm.
- Wait a minute.

292
00:15:19,605 --> 00:15:22,707
They found five bodies
at a house in Florida.

293
00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:24,475
Missing a couple of hearts.

294
00:15:28,214 --> 00:15:32,616
Okay, just try to keep people
away for a minute.

295
00:15:33,552 --> 00:15:36,721
- Nicely.
- Mm-hmm.

296
00:15:36,723 --> 00:15:40,057
- Hey, is this seat taken?

297
00:15:46,164 --> 00:15:47,264
- Excuse me, sir, this is...

298
00:15:47,266 --> 00:15:49,333
- won't be but a moment.

299
00:16:20,365 --> 00:16:22,666
- He's still in Richard's body.

300
00:16:22,668 --> 00:16:25,603
- Richard doesn't care, darling.

301
00:16:25,605 --> 00:16:30,307
- I fucking do.

302
00:16:30,309 --> 00:16:33,144
Well, so I guess
we came for not much.

303
00:16:33,146 --> 00:16:36,380
- On the contrary, we've
verified what attracts Reynard.

304
00:16:36,382 --> 00:16:38,015
- What?
- Witches doing rituals?

305
00:16:38,017 --> 00:16:39,717
I mean, that's thousands
of people every day.

306
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:42,787
- Not this type of ritual.

307
00:16:45,857 --> 00:16:47,591
Come on.

308
00:16:56,536 --> 00:16:59,870
- So, what do I do?

309
00:16:59,872 --> 00:17:02,006
- Well, per the books,

310
00:17:02,008 --> 00:17:05,643
you strip and jump in, I guess.

311
00:17:05,645 --> 00:17:07,645
Here, I'll help you.

312
00:17:07,647 --> 00:17:10,014
- You'll need to help him
sew those back on his wrists.

313
00:17:10,016 --> 00:17:12,716
- Who are you?
- I watch the river.

314
00:17:12,718 --> 00:17:15,786
And assist those
who require its magic.

315
00:17:18,824 --> 00:17:20,891
- This guy is fucking weird.

316
00:17:28,533 --> 00:17:30,434
- Go on.

317
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:41,078
Go. Go, go.

318
00:17:49,588 --> 00:17:51,956
You know, you're very beautiful.

319
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,791
Where are you from, hmm?

320
00:17:53,793 --> 00:17:55,092
Earth?

321
00:17:55,094 --> 00:17:58,095
Love women from earth.

322
00:17:58,097 --> 00:18:00,297
- Is it supposed
to take this long?

323
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:03,567
- No.
- He may have drowned.

324
00:18:03,569 --> 00:18:05,269
- Are you kidding?
- Why didn't you...

325
00:18:05,271 --> 00:18:09,273
- oh, oh, oh.
- There we go.

326
00:18:09,275 --> 00:18:11,642
Are you sure I can't interest
you in an elixir?

327
00:18:11,644 --> 00:18:13,577
It... it's small batch
and very fresh.

328
00:18:13,579 --> 00:18:16,146
- No, thank you.
- I have a tooth powder

329
00:18:16,148 --> 00:18:17,982
that I think
you are going to love.

330
00:18:17,984 --> 00:18:20,284
- You know what?
- We're kinda in a hurry.

331
00:18:20,286 --> 00:18:22,553
- I understand.
- As you wish.

332
00:18:22,555 --> 00:18:24,622
Pleasure to serve.

333
00:18:26,758 --> 00:18:27,992
- I think he wants a tip.

334
00:18:27,994 --> 00:18:29,994
- 20 gold pieces is customary.

335
00:18:29,996 --> 00:18:31,729
- Okay, that sounds like a lot.

336
00:18:31,731 --> 00:18:33,163
- Well, this is
Chatwin's torrent.

337
00:18:33,165 --> 00:18:35,165
- We don't have...
- There was nothing

338
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:36,934
about charging in the books.

339
00:18:36,936 --> 00:18:39,270
- Oh, uh, you'd rather pay
in labor?

340
00:18:39,272 --> 00:18:40,804
I think three to five years.

341
00:18:40,806 --> 00:18:42,907
- Are you fucking kidding me?

342
00:18:42,909 --> 00:18:45,175
You said none of this
before I went in the river.

343
00:18:45,177 --> 00:18:46,810
- Because I have manners...

344
00:18:46,812 --> 00:18:49,313
- are you even officially
affiliated with the torrent?

345
00:18:49,315 --> 00:18:50,581
- Penny, chill out.

346
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:51,982
- It's kind of
an amateur calling.

347
00:18:51,984 --> 00:18:53,984
- Oh, I see.
- Yes, yes, you're a con man.

348
00:18:53,986 --> 00:18:56,954
- No, penny...
- No, I know his type.

349
00:18:56,956 --> 00:18:58,923
I've been ripped off
plenty of times

350
00:18:58,925 --> 00:19:02,660
by smiling little snake oil
pricks like this dude.

351
00:19:02,662 --> 00:19:04,128
- Okay, all right.
- Same in Detroit,

352
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:07,031
same in Mumbai, same in Fillory.

353
00:19:07,033 --> 00:19:09,199
Sorry, try it on the next sap

354
00:19:09,201 --> 00:19:13,837
who needs this natural resource
on public property.

355
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:15,606
Good luck.

356
00:19:15,608 --> 00:19:18,475
- I'm sorry.
- He gets touchy.

357
00:19:18,477 --> 00:19:20,644
It's... it's not personal.

358
00:19:20,646 --> 00:19:23,881
Um, these are diamond.

359
00:19:23,883 --> 00:19:27,217
- What the hell is diamond?
- Here.

360
00:19:27,219 --> 00:19:29,720
- When you meet one scammer,
you met 'em all. Let's go.

361
00:19:29,722 --> 00:19:31,789
- Okay.

362
00:19:45,714 --> 00:19:48,181
- Okay, so this net...
- This net you throw,

363
00:19:48,183 --> 00:19:49,649
what sort of a net
catches a god?

364
00:19:49,651 --> 00:19:51,051
- Oh, it's an obscure bit
of casting,

365
00:19:51,053 --> 00:19:52,719
but I assure you it works.

366
00:19:52,721 --> 00:19:55,522
We'll just have to act fast
when the time comes.

367
00:19:55,524 --> 00:19:57,824
It'll hold for a few seconds.

368
00:19:57,826 --> 00:20:00,927
So...

369
00:20:00,929 --> 00:20:02,996
I need a few items.

370
00:20:07,768 --> 00:20:10,670
- Okay, it might be better for
me to go alone for some of this.

371
00:20:10,672 --> 00:20:13,073
- Uh, can you drop me
at the playground?

372
00:20:13,075 --> 00:20:15,108
I like to watch
the little children play.

373
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,711
It's perfectly innocent.

374
00:20:33,329 --> 00:20:36,098
- Al, we got your note.

375
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,433
Let's do this.

376
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,677
I call high queen.

377
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:42,712
Did it work?

378
00:20:42,714 --> 00:20:45,115
- Perfect.
- Lead the way.

379
00:20:55,726 --> 00:20:58,295
It's fine.
They're just healing.

380
00:21:12,944 --> 00:21:16,479
<i>- * so you showed me
around your town *</i>

381
00:21:16,481 --> 00:21:19,649
<i>* to hell again and back *</i>

382
00:21:19,651 --> 00:21:22,919
<i>* our love has served
to alienate *</i>

383
00:21:22,921 --> 00:21:26,289
<i>* all the friends
you depend on *</i>

384
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:29,893
<i>* I know it might seem odd *</i>

385
00:21:29,895 --> 00:21:32,896
<i>* 'cause you're not
the only one *</i>

386
00:21:32,898 --> 00:21:36,166
<i>* I remember myself
as a lonely child *</i>

387
00:21:36,168 --> 00:21:40,303
<i>* so I was
and you got me wrong *</i>

388
00:21:40,305 --> 00:21:41,905
<i>* you got me wrong *</i>

389
00:21:41,907 --> 00:21:47,277
<i>- * ground your sense of worth *</i>

390
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:49,012
<i>* till the spark
of morning burns *</i>

391
00:21:49,014 --> 00:21:51,948
- do you think he's sleeping
or dead?

392
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,617
I don't know, should we just go
into the trunk?

393
00:21:53,619 --> 00:21:56,753
- Oh, pussies.

394
00:21:56,755 --> 00:21:59,656
- He looks dead.
- I guess we're late.

395
00:22:06,163 --> 00:22:08,231
Oh, dear.

396
00:22:10,601 --> 00:22:14,671
Oh, dear.

397
00:22:20,011 --> 00:22:22,879
I am the knight of crowns.

398
00:22:22,881 --> 00:22:25,448
Uh, my apologies.

399
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:30,020
I seem to have died waiting
for you aspirants to come.

400
00:22:30,022 --> 00:22:34,057
Y-y-you are aspirants?

401
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:35,959
Uh...

402
00:22:35,961 --> 00:22:38,662
I'm the high king of Fillory.

403
00:22:38,664 --> 00:22:40,063
I took a blood test.

404
00:22:40,065 --> 00:22:44,868
- Excellent, excellent.
- It's an honor.

405
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:47,003
- Can we have the crowns,
please?

406
00:22:47,005 --> 00:22:49,305
- Certainly.
- Honored to oblige.

407
00:22:49,307 --> 00:22:52,642
Just as soon
as you pass the test.

408
00:22:52,644 --> 00:22:54,878
- Of course there's a test.

409
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,848
- As you know,
only a child of earth

410
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:02,419
can wear the crown
of the high king.

411
00:23:02,421 --> 00:23:04,654
I will ask you
a series of questions

412
00:23:04,656 --> 00:23:07,323
designed to root out
all pretenders to the throne.

413
00:23:07,325 --> 00:23:10,326
Only a true high king
will hold the answers

414
00:23:10,328 --> 00:23:12,395
in his heart.

415
00:23:14,765 --> 00:23:18,268
- Come at me.

416
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:22,405
- What popular American
television program

417
00:23:22,407 --> 00:23:25,375
stars actor Tim Daly?

418
00:23:25,377 --> 00:23:26,910
- What the fuck?

419
00:23:26,912 --> 00:23:28,845
- He was in a lot of TV shows.

420
00:23:28,847 --> 00:23:30,613
- There is only one
correct answer.

421
00:23:30,615 --> 00:23:32,449
- Okay.
- Give me the next question.

422
00:23:32,451 --> 00:23:36,853
- This hit single
is performed by offspring

423
00:23:36,855 --> 00:23:38,755
of famous entertainers.

424
00:23:38,757 --> 00:23:41,458
- Dude, that is crazy vague.

425
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,727
- You will receive
a single hint.

426
00:23:43,729 --> 00:23:46,596
Your hint is beach boys.

427
00:23:46,598 --> 00:23:49,899
"Hold on" by Wilson Phillips.

428
00:23:49,901 --> 00:23:51,735
- That song is my jam.

429
00:23:51,737 --> 00:23:54,571
- Wait, all these questions
are from the '90s.

430
00:23:54,573 --> 00:23:57,307
- It... it's not the 1990s
on earth right now?

431
00:23:57,309 --> 00:23:59,275
- No, it... it's 2017.

432
00:23:59,277 --> 00:24:03,213
Oh, and it's, uh, "wings,"
the... the Tim Daly show. "Wings."

433
00:24:03,215 --> 00:24:07,450
- Of course you know that.
- Okay, '90s.

434
00:24:07,452 --> 00:24:10,053
Ask me something
about Patrick Swayze.

435
00:24:10,055 --> 00:24:12,122
- You know of Swayze?

436
00:24:20,131 --> 00:24:24,434
Ahem.

437
00:24:24,436 --> 00:24:26,236
"Sorry about the disruption,
folks,

438
00:24:26,238 --> 00:24:29,105
"but I always do the last dance
of the season.

439
00:24:29,107 --> 00:24:31,007
"This year somebody told me
not to.

440
00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:33,009
"So I'm gonna do
my kind of dancing

441
00:24:33,011 --> 00:24:34,744
"with a great partner,

442
00:24:34,746 --> 00:24:37,247
"who's not only
a terrific dancer,

443
00:24:37,249 --> 00:24:40,183
"somebody who's taught me

444
00:24:40,185 --> 00:24:42,185
"that there are people out there
willing to stand up

445
00:24:42,187 --> 00:24:45,655
"for other people
no matter what it costs them.

446
00:24:45,657 --> 00:24:49,926
"Somebody who's taught me

447
00:24:49,928 --> 00:24:53,596
"about the kind of person
I want to be.

448
00:24:53,598 --> 00:24:55,298
Miss Frances houseman."

449
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:59,803
- Oh, your majesty.

450
00:24:59,805 --> 00:25:03,540
The crowns of Fillory are yours.

451
00:25:19,157 --> 00:25:21,024
- So I guess we just
put them on.

452
00:25:21,026 --> 00:25:22,492
- No, god, stop.

453
00:25:22,494 --> 00:25:26,563
I mean, I just...
We should do a-a ceremony.

454
00:25:26,565 --> 00:25:28,531
This is only gonna happen once.

455
00:25:28,533 --> 00:25:30,567
We are becoming
kings and queens,

456
00:25:30,569 --> 00:25:36,172
so... It's important
and we should honor it.

457
00:25:36,174 --> 00:25:40,677
Just give me that.

458
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:43,847
Kneel, Eliot Waugh.

459
00:25:43,849 --> 00:25:46,950
Would you just do it?
It's gonna be quick, I promise.

460
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:56,059
So, destiny is...
It's bullshit.

461
00:25:56,061 --> 00:25:59,028
But you are high king
in your blood.

462
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,130
And somehow that makes sense,
you know?

463
00:26:01,132 --> 00:26:03,233
And I-i just...
For what it's worth,

464
00:26:03,235 --> 00:26:06,970
I think that you are going to be
a really good king.

465
00:26:06,972 --> 00:26:11,774
Um, so, um,
I-i dub thee,

466
00:26:11,776 --> 00:26:14,244
um, I don't know.

467
00:26:14,246 --> 00:26:16,479
Would you say, like,
you're more brave or merciful?

468
00:26:16,481 --> 00:26:19,249
- I'd say I'm neither.

469
00:26:19,251 --> 00:26:22,619
But I still plan to be
a spectacular monarch.

470
00:26:22,621 --> 00:26:24,954
- I hereby dub thee

471
00:26:24,956 --> 00:26:27,891
high king Eliot

472
00:26:27,893 --> 00:26:30,460
the spectacular.

473
00:26:33,831 --> 00:26:38,101
- Wow, uh,

474
00:26:38,103 --> 00:26:41,170
this feels as natural
as underwear.

475
00:26:45,309 --> 00:26:48,912
Thank you.

476
00:26:48,914 --> 00:26:51,648
By the power vested in me by...

477
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:54,817
I have no idea,

478
00:26:54,819 --> 00:26:57,954
I do hereby crown you

479
00:26:57,956 --> 00:27:01,758
high queen Margo

480
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,259
the destroyer.

481
00:27:03,261 --> 00:27:05,128
I mean that
in the best possible sense.

482
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:09,499
Uh, all hail.
Everyone clap.

483
00:27:14,204 --> 00:27:17,707
I have known what you truly are

484
00:27:17,709 --> 00:27:20,677
since the day we met.

485
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:22,745
Long may you reign.

486
00:27:32,556 --> 00:27:35,191
I feel it's incumbent upon me

487
00:27:35,193 --> 00:27:39,629
to promise never again
to betray you like I did.

488
00:27:39,631 --> 00:27:44,367
I really...
Really am sorry.

489
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:48,805
I have some character defects.
I'm working on it.

490
00:27:48,807 --> 00:27:50,873
Honestly.

491
00:27:57,681 --> 00:28:00,550
- I'm working on some too.

492
00:28:00,552 --> 00:28:03,052
- Well, on that note,

493
00:28:03,054 --> 00:28:07,090
I crown you queen Alice

494
00:28:07,092 --> 00:28:08,925
the wise.

495
00:28:18,702 --> 00:28:20,903
- No, wait.

496
00:28:20,905 --> 00:28:23,973
Since we're cleaning slates
and shit, give me.

497
00:28:27,111 --> 00:28:30,847
Q.

498
00:28:30,849 --> 00:28:35,051
Uh, I could start
by saying something cruel

499
00:28:35,053 --> 00:28:37,787
yet totally hilarious about you.

500
00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:42,358
Let's be real,
you're an easy target.

501
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,293
But that's...

502
00:28:44,295 --> 00:28:47,730
Well, that's because you're
honest about what you love.

503
00:28:47,732 --> 00:28:50,199
And underneath it all, that's...

504
00:28:50,201 --> 00:28:52,602
Inspiring.

505
00:28:54,271 --> 00:28:56,272
And I'm sorry too.

506
00:28:56,274 --> 00:28:57,774
Not about the sex,

507
00:28:57,776 --> 00:29:00,777
I don't even really remember it.

508
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:04,113
Mostly my part in fucking up
something that was good for you.

509
00:29:04,115 --> 00:29:07,617
- Thanks, I think
I fucked it up just fine myself.

510
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:09,752
- Now that we're ruling
a kingdom together,

511
00:29:09,754 --> 00:29:12,288
I hope we can be
whatever we were again.

512
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:14,924
- I guess you could
call that friends.

513
00:29:14,926 --> 00:29:17,260
- Let's go with that.

514
00:29:17,262 --> 00:29:20,897
I hereby crown you king Quentin

515
00:29:20,899 --> 00:29:26,135
the moderately
socially maladjusted.

516
00:29:26,137 --> 00:29:29,205
- Scrunch down.
- Yeah.

517
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:42,418
Royalty, bitches.

518
00:29:54,764 --> 00:29:56,832
- Okay.

519
00:30:02,205 --> 00:30:05,440
Shit.

520
00:30:08,111 --> 00:30:09,611
- Hey, everything okay?

521
00:30:09,613 --> 00:30:10,846
- I'm going back to the torrent.

522
00:30:10,848 --> 00:30:12,681
- You think that guy
did something to you

523
00:30:12,683 --> 00:30:14,850
'cause you were a raging douche?

524
00:30:14,852 --> 00:30:16,651
- I'll sweet talk him.

525
00:30:16,653 --> 00:30:19,154
Get him to fix my hands, then...
Then I'll head to the castle.

526
00:30:19,156 --> 00:30:21,223
Everything's under control.

527
00:30:35,004 --> 00:30:38,073
- Alice.

528
00:30:40,209 --> 00:30:43,345
- Apology accepted.

529
00:30:43,347 --> 00:30:47,682
That was you apologizing
for what you did.

530
00:30:47,684 --> 00:30:49,584
I just...

531
00:30:49,586 --> 00:30:52,787
If we survive this,
I hope we can be friends still.

532
00:30:56,058 --> 00:30:59,561
I know it may sound stupid,

533
00:30:59,563 --> 00:31:02,030
but that's what I'm mad
at you for,

534
00:31:02,032 --> 00:31:05,834
not... not the cheating part.

535
00:31:05,836 --> 00:31:11,273
The part where what you did
made me lose you.

536
00:31:11,275 --> 00:31:13,408
And you're a big part
of my life, Quentin.

537
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:17,712
- You can never lose me, Alice.

538
00:31:17,714 --> 00:31:19,548
I mean, you can avoid me,
you can hate me...

539
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,917
- I don't hate you.

540
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,686
- Well, you can't lose me.

541
00:31:24,688 --> 00:31:26,755
Sorry.

542
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:35,363
- I just...
- I can't stop thinking.

543
00:31:35,365 --> 00:31:38,066
We're gonna find
this epic spell, great.

544
00:31:38,068 --> 00:31:42,537
But I'm afraid I'm just gonna...

545
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:44,606
Freeze again when the beast
is in front of me.

546
00:31:44,608 --> 00:31:47,275
- You're thinking
about it wrong.

547
00:31:47,277 --> 00:31:48,877
Cool under pressure
is not a talent.

548
00:31:48,879 --> 00:31:50,979
It's a... it's a skill,
and you need to practice.

549
00:31:50,981 --> 00:31:55,450
You... come on.

550
00:31:55,452 --> 00:31:57,752
We stood on a roof together
during the trials,

551
00:31:57,754 --> 00:31:58,987
and you told me that you were
afraid to see

552
00:31:58,989 --> 00:32:02,791
what you're really capable of.

553
00:32:02,793 --> 00:32:06,261
That was then.

554
00:32:06,263 --> 00:32:08,897
So let's see
what you can do now.

555
00:32:08,899 --> 00:32:11,066
- I'm not sure it'll help.

556
00:32:11,068 --> 00:32:13,101
- Then do it for me.
- I'm not gonna lie.

557
00:32:13,103 --> 00:32:16,504
I... I'm dying to see
what you can do.

558
00:32:19,342 --> 00:32:21,176
- I'm not a naturalist.

559
00:32:21,178 --> 00:32:22,744
- You know the spell, we all do.

560
00:32:22,746 --> 00:32:24,813
We just sucked at it.

561
00:32:28,985 --> 00:32:31,052
Let's see what you can do now.

562
00:32:43,933 --> 00:32:48,837
- Oh.
- That feels...

563
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:53,041
It's just like breathing.

564
00:32:53,043 --> 00:32:56,111
- See?
- Nice.

565
00:33:21,504 --> 00:33:25,607
So how do you feel now?

566
00:33:43,526 --> 00:33:45,694
- We're not getting back
together.

567
00:33:45,696 --> 00:33:47,762
- Okay.

568
00:34:01,511 --> 00:34:04,112
- I've been wondering something.

569
00:34:04,114 --> 00:34:06,714
Why didn't Reynard kill you
with your friends?

570
00:34:06,716 --> 00:34:08,783
Why were you spared?

571
00:34:19,094 --> 00:34:21,095
You weren't spared, were you?

572
00:34:21,097 --> 00:34:23,064
- Look, let's not go there,
okay?

573
00:34:23,066 --> 00:34:25,400
- You know, when I was a boy,

574
00:34:25,402 --> 00:34:27,769
a man who was meant
to care for me

575
00:34:27,771 --> 00:34:30,972
bent me over his desk
and had me over and over

576
00:34:30,974 --> 00:34:33,608
every time I was alone with him.

577
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:36,244
It helps me understand a truth.

578
00:34:36,246 --> 00:34:39,914
You're powerful or you're weak.

579
00:34:39,916 --> 00:34:43,651
If you're powerful,
you will survive.

580
00:34:43,653 --> 00:34:46,454
- So what, you're suggesting
I just get over it?

581
00:34:46,456 --> 00:34:48,523
- Actually, yes.

582
00:34:51,393 --> 00:34:54,829
- How?
- Mutate?

583
00:34:54,831 --> 00:34:56,130
Take over a world,

584
00:34:56,132 --> 00:34:57,799
kill a bunch of grad students
39 times?

585
00:34:57,801 --> 00:35:02,170
Eh, see, what you feel,

586
00:35:02,172 --> 00:35:04,305
the haunted look in your eyes,

587
00:35:04,307 --> 00:35:08,910
doesn't come from nowhere.

588
00:35:08,912 --> 00:35:11,245
- Then where does it come from?

589
00:35:11,247 --> 00:35:13,014
- In the center of your being,

590
00:35:13,016 --> 00:35:17,285
there's a tiny beating heart.

591
00:35:17,287 --> 00:35:19,420
- What, you mean like my soul?

592
00:35:19,422 --> 00:35:21,923
- Part of it, yes,
the slimmest part,

593
00:35:21,925 --> 00:35:25,093
but it holds specific power.

594
00:35:25,095 --> 00:35:27,295
It's called a shade.

595
00:35:27,297 --> 00:35:29,864
- Shade.

596
00:35:29,866 --> 00:35:32,033
- It's what makes you feel

597
00:35:32,035 --> 00:35:36,137
the pain will burn you
till there's nothing.

598
00:35:36,139 --> 00:35:38,272
And, yes, it's also there
for love,

599
00:35:38,274 --> 00:35:40,308
but, uh, let's be Frank,
darling,

600
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:42,143
you're more likely
to throw yourself off a bridge

601
00:35:42,145 --> 00:35:47,014
than ever love again.

602
00:35:47,016 --> 00:35:49,817
I felt that way.

603
00:35:49,819 --> 00:35:53,688
And I knew it crippled me
when I needed to be strong.

604
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,757
As you do now.

605
00:36:02,531 --> 00:36:04,599
You know...

606
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:11,139
I don't care for people,
as a rule.

607
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:20,648
I like you.

608
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:22,150
You have promise.

609
00:36:22,152 --> 00:36:26,587
With the right control,
you would be formidable.

610
00:36:26,589 --> 00:36:31,225
Even a worthy collaborator.

611
00:36:31,227 --> 00:36:34,295
I have plans.
You could be part of them.

612
00:36:37,099 --> 00:36:39,433
- If?
- Do what I did.

613
00:36:39,435 --> 00:36:42,570
Sever your shade.

614
00:36:42,572 --> 00:36:45,773
- Sever.
- It's not hard.

615
00:36:45,775 --> 00:36:48,676
You'll feel better.

616
00:36:48,678 --> 00:36:51,179
You'll feel happy.

617
00:36:51,181 --> 00:36:53,247
I can show you how.

618
00:36:55,751 --> 00:36:58,753
- No, thank you.

619
00:36:58,755 --> 00:37:01,823
- Do let me know
if you change your mind.

620
00:37:53,642 --> 00:37:55,576
- Eliot!

621
00:37:55,578 --> 00:37:58,145
The crown suits you, of course.

622
00:37:58,147 --> 00:38:00,414
- Who are all these people?
- The Pickwick family.

623
00:38:00,416 --> 00:38:02,616
They've been running things
till children of earth came.

624
00:38:05,821 --> 00:38:07,188
- Your highness.

625
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,689
Tick Pickwick
of the northern marsh Pickwicks,

626
00:38:08,691 --> 00:38:10,291
at your service.

627
00:38:10,293 --> 00:38:12,426
The rest of the king's council
will arrive shortly.

628
00:38:12,428 --> 00:38:15,463
- Great.
- So glad you're here.

629
00:38:15,465 --> 00:38:17,431
There are a few problems.

630
00:38:17,433 --> 00:38:19,300
Uh, several problems

631
00:38:19,302 --> 00:38:20,935
that could use
your immediate attention.

632
00:38:20,937 --> 00:38:23,537
- Ah, okay, great.
- We should probably get started.

633
00:38:23,539 --> 00:38:25,840
- First, your throne room.

634
00:38:25,842 --> 00:38:27,508
I'm afraid it's been locked
a long time.

635
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,143
- We're looking for the key.
- That's fine.

636
00:38:29,145 --> 00:38:32,213
Uh, take me straight to
the armory.

637
00:39:08,984 --> 00:39:13,721
- The armory,
your, uh, highnesses.

638
00:39:13,723 --> 00:39:15,923
- Well, this is underwhelming.

639
00:39:15,925 --> 00:39:18,993
- This is supposed to be
full of books.

640
00:39:21,897 --> 00:39:23,331
- "Strategies for trapping

641
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:25,433
tomato-eating garden fairies."

642
00:39:25,435 --> 00:39:27,501
Yeah, no.

643
00:39:27,503 --> 00:39:29,337
- Someone took
all the battle magic.

644
00:39:29,339 --> 00:39:32,039
- It's not like the beast
is coming to find us any second.

645
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:34,175
- Wait, this is something.

646
00:39:34,177 --> 00:39:37,244
It's an... it's a workbook
on spells, serious ones.

647
00:39:37,246 --> 00:39:39,180
Looks like battle magic.

648
00:39:39,182 --> 00:39:41,015
But the actual spells
aren't here.

649
00:39:41,017 --> 00:39:44,418
- Hmm, like notes on cake,
but no actual recipes.

650
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,554
That's helpful.

651
00:39:46,556 --> 00:39:49,290
Who wrote it?

652
00:39:49,292 --> 00:39:51,525
- Oh, my god.
- What?

653
00:39:51,527 --> 00:39:53,594
- I know where we need to go.

654
00:39:55,964 --> 00:39:57,431
- Brakebills?

655
00:40:01,771 --> 00:40:05,973
- Hello?
- Mr., uh, Mr...

656
00:40:09,612 --> 00:40:13,014
Fuck!

657
00:40:13,016 --> 00:40:15,649
- Can I help you?

658
00:40:15,651 --> 00:40:17,618
- Hell, yes, you can.
- These don't work.

659
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,186
- Well, by all means,
request a refund.

660
00:40:19,188 --> 00:40:21,522
- Very funny.
- You did this on purpose.

661
00:40:21,524 --> 00:40:24,492
- Did what? Help an ungrateful
child of earth?

662
00:40:24,494 --> 00:40:25,826
- Look, I'll pay you
whatever you want, okay?

663
00:40:25,828 --> 00:40:27,161
I'm... I'm serious, okay?

664
00:40:27,163 --> 00:40:28,496
I'm friends
with the kings and queens.

665
00:40:28,498 --> 00:40:30,398
You want to be a Duke,
great, I got you...

666
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,900
- actions have consequences,
penny.

667
00:40:32,902 --> 00:40:35,836
Even glib words spoken
in casual arrogance.

668
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:37,972
It's past time you learned,

669
00:40:37,974 --> 00:40:40,041
especially give the position
you'll occupy soon.

670
00:40:40,043 --> 00:40:41,375
- What position?

671
00:40:41,377 --> 00:40:43,210
- You know what?
- I've done you a service.

672
00:40:43,212 --> 00:40:45,079
- No, no, look, hey, I'm...

673
00:40:45,081 --> 00:40:47,915
I'm sorry, okay?

674
00:40:47,917 --> 00:40:51,152
Please fix my hands.

675
00:40:51,154 --> 00:40:54,255
- See, how do I put this
in a way that you'll understand?

676
00:40:54,257 --> 00:40:58,259
Ah, go fuck yourself.

677
00:40:58,261 --> 00:41:01,829
- No, wait!

678
00:41:01,831 --> 00:41:03,898
Fuck!

679
00:41:06,935 --> 00:41:09,703
- Hang onto this while I'm gone.

680
00:41:09,705 --> 00:41:12,406
- Oh.

681
00:41:12,408 --> 00:41:14,175
You guys all packed?

682
00:41:14,177 --> 00:41:17,912
- Yeah.

683
00:41:17,914 --> 00:41:20,881
El, thank you.

684
00:41:20,883 --> 00:41:23,517
- For what?
- For, um, taking one for the team

685
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:25,586
to the tune
of the rest of my life?

686
00:41:27,556 --> 00:41:30,391
I'm trying
to see this ruling thing

687
00:41:30,393 --> 00:41:32,793
as an adventure.

688
00:41:32,795 --> 00:41:35,563
Apparently we have enemies
to the north and south.

689
00:41:35,565 --> 00:41:39,700
Plus broken infrastructure
and huge magic issues

690
00:41:39,702 --> 00:41:42,470
thanks to the beast
and his wellspring addiction.

691
00:41:42,472 --> 00:41:45,206
And do you know they don't know
what champagne is here?

692
00:41:46,942 --> 00:41:49,143
I plan on inventing it.

693
00:41:49,145 --> 00:41:50,978
I'd like to be known as...

694
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:54,415
The champagne king.

695
00:41:54,417 --> 00:41:55,616
- It has a ring to it.

696
00:41:55,618 --> 00:41:57,318
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

697
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:00,221
- I'm really looking forward
to drinking socially,

698
00:42:00,223 --> 00:42:02,289
like the French.

699
00:42:07,329 --> 00:42:11,065
So, uh, in the books,

700
00:42:11,067 --> 00:42:13,567
time doesn't exactly run
the same speed

701
00:42:13,569 --> 00:42:17,404
on earth as in Fillory.

702
00:42:17,406 --> 00:42:18,839
- I mean, look, sometimes
it got screwy

703
00:42:18,841 --> 00:42:21,675
when Jane and Martin
would go back and forth.

704
00:42:21,677 --> 00:42:23,744
- But not always.

705
00:42:25,914 --> 00:42:27,982
- It's gonna be fine.

706
00:42:29,918 --> 00:42:31,685
- Yeah.

707
00:42:31,687 --> 00:42:33,254
Yeah.

708
00:42:33,256 --> 00:42:35,990
Or I'll just live out my days

709
00:42:35,992 --> 00:42:39,059
waiting for my friends
to return and die alone.

710
00:42:46,434 --> 00:42:49,537
You know, it's considered
extremely disrespectful

711
00:42:49,539 --> 00:42:52,606
to touch a king
without permission.

712
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:58,812
But, um, I think you should...

713
00:42:58,814 --> 00:43:01,882
Probably hug me right now.

714
00:43:11,326 --> 00:43:12,993
It'll also be okay if you just

715
00:43:12,995 --> 00:43:15,496
give my ass, like,
a little squeeze.

716
00:43:18,467 --> 00:43:22,836
- Feel free to, uh, double-check
this before I get started.

717
00:43:22,838 --> 00:43:24,905
Julia?

718
00:43:36,851 --> 00:43:39,820
- Why do you want to help me

719
00:43:39,822 --> 00:43:42,656
with my shade?

720
00:43:42,658 --> 00:43:44,258
- Without your shade,

721
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:48,862
you would see
a lot of things differently.

722
00:43:48,864 --> 00:43:52,666
You'd be able to live, Julia.

723
00:43:52,668 --> 00:43:54,702
Come here.

724
00:43:54,704 --> 00:43:56,770
Let me show you.

725
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:31,272
- We're there.
- Put it back.

726
00:44:31,274 --> 00:44:34,608
- It's okay, it's okay.

727
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:37,711
- I need it.

728
00:44:37,713 --> 00:44:40,781
Put it back now, Martin.

729
00:44:42,117 --> 00:44:44,485
- Suit yourself.

730
00:45:04,005 --> 00:45:07,274
- I understand
why you're afraid.

731
00:45:07,276 --> 00:45:09,677
You don't want to lose yourself.

732
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:11,979
But hear me on this.

733
00:45:11,981 --> 00:45:13,747
Martyring yourself to your pain

734
00:45:13,749 --> 00:45:15,349
isn't all it's advertised to be.

735
00:45:15,351 --> 00:45:18,419
It'll destroy you.

736
00:45:18,421 --> 00:45:21,689
There's no glory in that.

737
00:45:21,691 --> 00:45:25,526
You might get Reynard, yes.

738
00:45:25,528 --> 00:45:28,662
But he'll still win.

739
00:45:28,664 --> 00:45:30,664
Anyways.
