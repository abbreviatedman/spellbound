Shouldn't be this hard for a girl

360
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:44,123
to get an evil demigod abortion.

361
00:18:44,157 --> 00:18:45,612
And we're emotionally advanced.

362
00:18:45,637 --> 00:18:48,534
We can hold resentment and sympathy
for a person at the same time.

363
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,381
And Fillory's broke. We need gold.

364
00:18:50,406 --> 00:18:53,266
So lucky you.

365
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,626
Thank you.

366
00:18:54,651 --> 00:18:56,705
Okay, uh...

367
00:18:57,437 --> 00:18:59,740
so if this heist is happening,

368
00:18:59,773 --> 00:19:01,975
any ideas as to how?

369
00:19:02,591 --> 00:19:04,027
Well, we cased the bank.

370
00:19:04,052 --> 00:19:06,685
There was a pretty gnarly
ward around the vault.

371
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:09,146
Who here's actually robbed a bank?

372
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,365
When was this?

373
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:14,105
Senior year of high school.

374
00:19:15,421 --> 00:19:17,223
I had some issues.

375
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:19,660
Okay, listen up,

376
00:19:19,685 --> 00:19:22,495
'cause I'm only gonna go
through this shit once.

377
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,163
<i>Any bank worth robbing</i>

378
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:27,072
<i>uses one of a handful
of security systems.</i>

379
00:19:27,097 --> 00:19:29,036
<i>All the usual bells and whistles.</i>

380
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:31,158
<i>But what most idiots don't know</i>

381
00:19:31,183 --> 00:19:34,173
<i>is, those companies are
all owned by Magicians.</i>

382
00:19:34,207 --> 00:19:36,176
Wait, so the people that work there...

383
00:19:36,209 --> 00:19:39,351
Clueless. Tellers,
managers, security guards.

384
00:19:39,376 --> 00:19:40,523
They're all Muggles.

385
00:19:40,548 --> 00:19:43,516
They have no idea the
vault has a secret feature.

386
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:44,951
Serious wards.

387
00:19:44,985 --> 00:19:48,338
Designed specifically
to keep out Magicians.

388
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,720
<i>Now, in the case of our target,</i>

389
00:19:50,745 --> 00:19:53,721
<i>their fingerprints
control the alarm systems.</i>

390
00:19:54,815 --> 00:19:56,196
<i>It takes two managers</i>

391
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:58,784
<i>scanning their prints simultaneously</i>

392
00:19:58,809 --> 00:19:59,900
<i>to do this.</i>

393
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:02,436
<i>Once both the alarms
and the wards go down,</i>

394
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:05,072
<i>you've got ten minutes
to get downstairs,</i>

395
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:06,610
<i>past the armed guards,</i>

396
00:20:06,635 --> 00:20:09,483
<i>and enter in the
correct ten-digit combo.</i>

397
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,345
<i>If you screw up the combination</i>

398
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:13,380
<i>or you take longer than ten minutes,</i>

399
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:14,563
<i>you're fucked.</i>

400
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,951
Now, basic bitches trip all
the standard alarm systems,

401
00:20:17,984 --> 00:20:19,353
but Magicians?

402
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:23,556
We also trip the magic
wards, which means...

403
00:20:23,581 --> 00:20:25,209
<i>battle Magicians.</i>

404
00:20:25,234 --> 00:20:29,037
Full-time security employees
on the DL, with benefits.

405
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:31,064
You see one, run.

406
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:33,901
They only ask questions post-mortem.

407
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,968
But our ace is you.

408
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:39,038
Once we nab prints and drop the wards,

409
00:20:39,072 --> 00:20:40,407
you travel straight in.

410
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:42,809
You really don't think a
bank vault, of all places,

411
00:20:42,843 --> 00:20:44,478
has anti-traveler protection?

412
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,845
Oh, they do.

413
00:20:45,879 --> 00:20:47,159
The entire floor of the vault

414
00:20:47,184 --> 00:20:49,249
is one big anti-traveling sigil.

415
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:52,119
You get locked in till
you run out of air.

416
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:55,255
Yeah. Pass. I like air.

417
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:57,024
Relax, dummy.

418
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:59,433
You only get stuck if you hit the floor.

419
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,394
Oh, so it's like "Mission: Impossible."

420
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:04,131
That movie was stupidly unrealistic.

421
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:06,532
It's so much easier to just levitate.

422
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:08,398
Yeah, I don't know how,

423
00:21:08,423 --> 00:21:10,156
and in case you guys have all forgotten,

424
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:11,470
I can't do magic.

425
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:14,141
Oh, that's fine. This is
gonna get done <i>to</i> you.

426
00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:15,812
It's a little thingy

427
00:21:15,837 --> 00:21:17,544
any Physical Kid can
make in their sleep.

428
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:19,345
Gravity belt. Exactly.

429
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:22,616
Once we drop the wards, float Penny,

430
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:26,896
he zips in, he zips out... payday.

431

[animalistic growling]

432
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:29,923
Julia, run!

433
00:21:30,013 --> 00:21:31,749
It's there. You just don't see it. Go!

434
00:21:31,774 --> 00:21:33,593
- I thought it was dead.
- I guess it's got friends.

435
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,428
- Kady, come on.
- No, you go. I'll catch up.

436
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:36,989
- Kady!
- No! I need to kill it.

437
00:21:37,014 --> 00:21:38,208
- I'll be fine.
- Why?

438
00:21:38,239 --> 00:21:40,466
- I need its spoon.
- Spoon?

439

This is yours, isn't it?

442
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,634
You sent those things
after Julia, didn't you?

443
00:21:57,659 --> 00:21:59,489
[speaking Korean]

444
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:03,825
See, this is what happen
when you don't pay.

445
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:04,989
<i>Jehn-jang.</i>

446
00:22:05,014 --> 00:22:07,561
- Lady, use your words.
<i>- Dak-chuh!</i>

447
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:09,349
This is for dokkaebi.

448
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:11,465
How you say... goblin.

449
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:12,665
Invisible, right?

450
00:22:12,699 --> 00:22:14,263
- Yeah.
- Right.

451
00:22:14,288 --> 00:22:15,823
This is very old magic.

452
00:22:15,848 --> 00:22:18,184
You bring to life using
old, abandoned things,

453
00:22:18,209 --> 00:22:20,211
like this wooden spoon...

454
00:22:20,407 --> 00:22:21,864
and menstrual blood.

455
00:22:21,931 --> 00:22:23,661
Probably Moon's.

456
00:22:25,442 --> 00:22:27,013
These creatures are mercenaries.

457
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:28,314
They won't stop.

458
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,684
You kill one, another
one grows in its place.

459
00:22:31,718 --> 00:22:33,085
Very fucked up.

460
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:34,655
Why the hell would she do that?

461
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:36,055
To kill your friend.

462
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:37,691
I told Moon to relax,

463
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:39,192
but she's all, "Baby's too evil.

464
00:22:39,225 --> 00:22:41,215
"It might hurt more people."

465
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,541
She wants to play it safe

466
00:22:42,566 --> 00:22:44,568
and kill both spawn and mom together.

467
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:46,165
She's so stupid.

468
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:48,401
You won't pay if your friend is dead.

469
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:51,048
Listen, we are trying to
get you the money, okay?

470
00:22:51,073 --> 00:22:53,114
If you want to get paid so fucking bad,

471
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:54,574
tell her to call it off.

472
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:57,406
Can't. She has a hundred spoons.

473
00:22:57,431 --> 00:23:00,346
Dokkaebi will not stop
until trickster baby is dead,

474
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,149
so you got two options.

475
00:23:02,181 --> 00:23:04,183
I can exorcise for you,

476
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:06,904
or monster rips your
friend's head off her neck.

477
00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:08,957
So hurry up with my gold.

00:23:21,668 --> 00:23:23,240
Hey.

480
00:23:24,339 --> 00:23:25,741
What's that?

481
00:23:25,766 --> 00:23:27,000
You remember that one time

482
00:23:27,025 --> 00:23:29,017
Richard and the Free
Traders rewound time?

483
00:23:29,042 --> 00:23:31,044
- Déjà pizza?
- Yeah.

484
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,126
I think this is how they did it.

485
00:23:34,447 --> 00:23:36,550
That was heavy cooperative magic.

486
00:23:36,575 --> 00:23:39,478
Yeah, well, there are
notes for version 2.0 here.

487
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:42,122
I mean, it's more
efficient. Takes less juice.

488
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:44,056
Either one of us could run it.

489
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,754
Let's see.

490
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:52,032
"The Quarterback"?

491
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,734
Goes back 15 seconds.

492
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:56,376
Get it? Quarter of a minute?

493
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:59,759
Yeah, Richard did like his dad jokes.

494
00:24:00,989 --> 00:24:03,351
Anyway, I thought it could be useful,

495
00:24:03,376 --> 00:24:05,112
but at this rate,

496
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:07,213
I won't actually get
it to work for weeks.

497
00:24:07,247 --> 00:24:09,248
And I guess I'd be weighed
down lugging it anyway.

498
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:12,218
It's got a pretty small
radius of influence.

499
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:14,842
Julia, you can't come.

500
00:24:15,522 --> 00:24:17,006
What?

501
00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:19,159
Those invisible blood-goblin things,

502
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:20,684
they won't stop coming.

503
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:23,497
I mean, not until your problem's dead,

504
00:24:23,951 --> 00:24:26,920
meaning you are.

505
00:24:26,945 --> 00:24:29,102
If you step out from
under these wards...

506
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,276
It'll find me and all of you.

507
00:24:32,511 --> 00:24:35,108
So I'm supposed to, what, just
wait here, fingers crossed,

508
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:37,110
while everyone who blames
me for Alice's death

509
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,245
risks their life?

510
00:24:38,277 --> 00:24:39,909
I mean, how does that even make sense?

511
00:24:39,934 --> 00:24:42,805
Just 'cause you can't come
doesn't mean you can't be there.

512
00:24:44,683 --> 00:24:47,520
You can listen in and watch.

513
00:24:51,636 --> 00:24:53,093
All right, but if anything goes wrong...

514
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:55,339
