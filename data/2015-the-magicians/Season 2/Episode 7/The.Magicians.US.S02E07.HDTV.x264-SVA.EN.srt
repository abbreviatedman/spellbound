1
00:00:00,023 --> 00:00:01,906
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:03,594 --> 00:00:05,530
They know everything...

3
00:00:05,562 --> 00:00:07,832
who you are, what you have done.

4
00:00:07,866 --> 00:00:09,200
You cannot go back.

5
00:00:09,233 --> 00:00:10,668
What am I supposed to do?

6
00:00:10,701 --> 00:00:12,069
What we all do.

7
00:00:12,103 --> 00:00:13,839
Decide.

8
00:00:13,976 --> 00:00:15,249
_

9
00:00:15,351 --> 00:00:17,608
- Hey, where's Kady?
- Who gives a shit?

10
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:20,077
I don't think Penny even
cares that she's gone.

11
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:23,390
Believe me, he does.

12
00:00:23,714 --> 00:00:25,523
We're gonna make another you.

13
00:00:25,548 --> 00:00:28,053
You sleep here, your
mind goes into the golem.

14
00:00:33,665 --> 00:00:35,601
The test was positive.

15
00:00:35,626 --> 00:00:36,760
I want an abortion.

16
00:00:36,793 --> 00:00:38,763
It's a totally mundane procedure.

17
00:00:38,796 --> 00:00:40,019
Is it?

18
00:00:40,044 --> 00:00:43,135
'Cause it might not be a simple,
totally mundane human embryo.

19
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,169
Stop. What are you doing? Stop! Kady!

20
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:48,969
So sorry about this.

21
00:00:49,734 --> 00:00:51,643
That's my Haxenpaxen!

22
00:00:51,675 --> 00:00:54,328
Just imagine what it's
giving off magically.

23
00:00:54,353 --> 00:00:56,750
We're invisible while we're near him.

24
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:01,118
- Kady!
- Your magic is no good here.

25
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,796
What's with Stink-master Flash?

26
00:01:04,858 --> 00:01:07,057
- He's coming with us.
- It's my mom's contact.

27
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:09,059
She could help with the baby situation.

28
00:01:09,093 --> 00:01:11,129
They may be able to help
your friend with her problem,

29
00:01:11,161 --> 00:01:14,074
but listen, I would never,
ever do business with them

30
00:01:14,099 --> 00:01:15,231
if I had a choice.

31
00:01:15,256 --> 00:01:17,902
Your majesties, the
much-venerated Emissaries

32
00:01:17,927 --> 00:01:19,637
of our neighbors to the north.

33
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:23,232
I present Prince Ess of Loria.

34
00:01:25,176 --> 00:01:28,046
- You fucked with us.
- Mm-hmm. Yes, you did.

35
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:30,581
- You fucked with our castle.
- Amen, sister.

36
00:01:30,614 --> 00:01:32,807
And now the High King and I

37
00:01:32,832 --> 00:01:36,487
hereby declare war on
the kingdom of Loria.

38
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,784
Yes!

39
00:01:37,809 --> 00:01:40,124
Wait, really?

40
00:01:40,158 --> 00:01:42,561
I cast the niffin summoning,
and you didn't come.

41
00:01:42,593 --> 00:01:45,296
You're wrong. I was right there.

42
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,595
I killed you. My cacodemon...

43
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,393
Your cacodemon wasn't
powerful enough to kill me.

44
00:01:50,418 --> 00:01:51,787
It tried.

45
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,322
But when it saw that it couldn't win,

46
00:01:53,355 --> 00:01:54,790
well, let's just say it

47
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:57,259
stuffed me in a place most convenient...

48
00:01:57,293 --> 00:02:00,029
that stupid tattoo trap on your back.

49
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:01,899
We're stuck with each other.

50
00:02:01,924 --> 00:02:03,210
Oh, Quentin.

51
00:02:03,235 --> 00:02:05,368
We're gonna have so much fun.

52
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:17,980
Stop ignoring me! Stop
ignoring me, you pussy!

53
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,955
Pay attention to me,
you miserable sad sack!

54
00:02:26,956 --> 00:02:29,268
- What's wrong with you?
- Stop it!

55
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,471
Are you ready to let me out
of that hairy back of yours?

56
00:02:34,504 --> 00:02:35,780
'Cause I'm never gonna stop.

57
00:02:35,805 --> 00:02:37,508
And sooner or later,
one of these dummies

58
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:40,295
are gonna call the brain
police, and you got priors.

59
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,319
This is not Alice. This is not Alice.

60
00:02:43,344 --> 00:02:45,446
This is not Alice. This is not Alice.

61
00:02:45,471 --> 00:02:47,774
Just keep telling yourself that.

62
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,621
You have got to stop.

63
00:02:49,653 --> 00:02:52,691
Fine. Let me out of
this trap, and I'm gone.

64
00:02:52,723 --> 00:02:55,423
Okay, look, Alice...

65
00:02:55,727 --> 00:02:58,915
Evil Thing Inside of Me
That Used to Be Alice...

66
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,077
I have to say the
words to open the trap.

67
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,269
Of my own volition. Out loud.

68
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:05,603
And I'm not going to do that

69
00:03:05,636 --> 00:03:07,739
because there is one
policy for you out here,

70
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,441
and it is to box you up for eternity.

71
00:03:09,473 --> 00:03:12,213
I'm kind of boxed up right now, in you.

72
00:03:12,238 --> 00:03:15,377
It's not the same
thing, and you know it.

73
00:03:16,014 --> 00:03:18,752
Block of wood isn't
trying to fix this. I am.

74
00:03:18,777 --> 00:03:22,248
Save me? Is that what
you think you're doing?

75
00:03:22,273 --> 00:03:23,655
You think I want that?

76
00:03:23,687 --> 00:03:25,289
I think if you were
really you right now,

77
00:03:25,323 --> 00:03:26,591
that's all you would want.

78
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:27,992
Oh, what, and you're the world's

79
00:03:28,026 --> 00:03:29,394
foremost expert on all things me?

80
00:03:29,426 --> 00:03:30,527
Based on what?

81
00:03:30,561 --> 00:03:32,296
Our garbage fire of a relationship

82
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:34,032
that ended with Eliot's
dick in your mouth?

83
00:03:34,064 --> 00:03:35,466
Look, you came really close

84
00:03:35,499 --> 00:03:36,735
to fixing this once for your brother.

85
00:03:36,768 --> 00:03:38,033
I thought I did.

86
00:03:38,058 --> 00:03:39,471
But I was like you then.

87
00:03:39,503 --> 00:03:41,305
Small yet weirdly arrogant

88
00:03:41,347 --> 00:03:43,417
for somebody who didn't
understand magic at all.

89
00:03:43,442 --> 00:03:46,478
If you would just work with
me instead of jabbing at me,

90
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,912
we could figure out what's missing.

91
00:03:47,944 --> 00:03:49,346
We could make the spell work.

92
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:50,681
We could do this.

93
00:03:50,715 --> 00:03:51,883
Listen to me.

94
00:03:51,915 --> 00:03:56,257
I promise, the math
will never add up, Q.

95
00:03:56,488 --> 00:03:58,890
You'll never get that girl back.

96
00:03:58,955 --> 00:04:03,027
Everything that's missing
burnt up when I became this.

97
00:04:03,061 --> 00:04:05,796
It's gone forever, Q.

98
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,832
This isn't good for either of us.

99
00:04:07,865 --> 00:04:11,536
No, no, this is making
me saner by the second.

100
00:04:11,568 --> 00:04:12,770
I don't want to hurt you.

101
00:04:12,804 --> 00:04:14,539
I actually don't want to hurt anyone.

102
00:04:14,572 --> 00:04:15,755
Bullshit, you're a niffin.

103
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,191
Q, I'm not bloodthirsty.

104
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:18,777
I just want to be free.

105
00:04:18,809 --> 00:04:21,879
And I already told you I can't do that.

106
00:04:21,922 --> 00:04:24,125
Fine. Just let me take over your body

107
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,816
for just the tiniest little bit.

108
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:28,063
I'll be good. I'll be so good.

109
00:04:28,179 --> 00:04:30,133
No, that's crazy.

110
00:04:30,158 --> 00:04:33,109
So I have to be a niffin, yet
I don't even get to be a niffin?

111
00:04:33,134 --> 00:04:34,563
I could travel the universe.

112
00:04:34,588 --> 00:04:35,922
I could see things you
couldn't even imagine,

113
00:04:35,947 --> 00:04:38,997
but instead, I have to be
bored and stuck with you!

114
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,566
I'm sorry that it is torture
to be with the one person

115
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,933
who is trying to help you.

116
00:04:42,967 --> 00:04:46,404
So go back to screaming
until you go insane?

117
00:04:46,436 --> 00:04:48,472
- Is that your choice?
- No.

118
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:50,224
That's your choice.

119
00:04:50,249 --> 00:04:52,506
Or you could be quiet.

120
00:04:58,747 --> 00:05:01,656
And you can let me try and solve this.

121
00:05:16,257 --> 00:05:18,593
Well, this is the place.

122
00:05:19,003 --> 00:05:21,689
Of course it is. Why wouldn't it be?

123
00:05:21,714 --> 00:05:24,329
I mean, Goldie said they're legit.

124
00:05:25,641 --> 00:05:27,924
Only one way to find out.

125
00:06:06,717 --> 00:06:08,510
- Problem?
- No problem.

126
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,655
We're just discussing how
to handle your situation.

127
00:06:11,688 --> 00:06:14,291
That's okay. My way is best way.

128
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,628
But you can abort it, right?

129
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,829
This is exorcism.

130
00:06:18,863 --> 00:06:20,799
That thing is not human.

131
00:06:20,832 --> 00:06:22,467
The longer it's inside you,

132
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,169
the more tangled it
gets with your essence

133
00:06:24,202 --> 00:06:25,904
and the harder it is for me to help you,

134
00:06:25,936 --> 00:06:27,579
you understand?

135
00:06:28,772 --> 00:06:29,925
Okay.

136
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:32,017
Then I exorcise the trickster for you.

137
00:06:37,681 --> 00:06:40,150
After you pay. Thank you.

138
00:06:41,867 --> 00:06:43,504
$1 million?

139
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:45,222
In gold.

140
00:06:45,255 --> 00:06:47,691
Paper money is for
drug dealers and idiots.

141
00:06:47,724 --> 00:06:49,059
Look, Goldie will tell
you I'm good for it.

142
00:06:49,092 --> 00:06:50,895
Can you just do it now
and we'll pay you later?

143
00:06:50,928 --> 00:06:53,198
Bars. Two big bars.

144
00:06:53,231 --> 00:06:54,822
Maybe 60 pounds.

145
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:56,155
That's all.

146
00:07:00,203 --> 00:07:02,105
What?

147
00:07:02,308 --> 00:07:03,942
No, I'm just... I'm trying to remember

148
00:07:03,974 --> 00:07:05,676
the last time not having enough money

149
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,378
was one of my biggest problems.

150
00:07:07,403 --> 00:07:10,420
Okay, well, cash won't cut it, so, what,

151
00:07:10,607 --> 00:07:12,049
pawnshops?

152
00:07:12,217 --> 00:07:15,486
A million dollars in
chains and earrings?

153
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,326
I mean, that would
take so many pawnshops.

154
00:07:18,562 --> 00:07:20,756
We might as well rob a bank.

155
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:24,475
Well, we are Magicians.

156
00:07:25,796 --> 00:07:28,033
Why don't we just rob a bank?

157
00:07:35,431 --> 00:07:39,094
<font color="#007700">Synced and corrected by Aaronnmb</font>
www.addic7ed.com

158
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:44,437
So there's really no way to just...

159
00:07:45,414 --> 00:07:47,585
take it all back?

160
00:07:47,618 --> 00:07:50,722
Your Majesty, one
cannot simply take back

161
00:07:50,747 --> 00:07:52,812
- a declaration of war.
- Good.

162
00:07:52,837 --> 00:07:54,711
Because I don't.

163
00:07:54,991 --> 00:07:57,594
There are Lorian troops
marching to the border.

164
00:07:57,628 --> 00:07:58,830
They're days away.

165
00:07:58,863 --> 00:08:01,032
We believe they intend
to penetrate Fillory

166
00:08:01,065 --> 00:08:03,001
by way of the Grudge Gap.

167
00:08:03,034 --> 00:08:05,169
And, of course, our
preparation is affected

168
00:08:05,202 --> 00:08:09,140
by the continued...
unsteadiness of the Wellspring.

169
00:08:09,172 --> 00:08:11,306
Okay, well, we've got
literally every engineer

170
00:08:11,331 --> 00:08:14,311
in the kingdom working to
de-shit-inate the Wellspring.

171
00:08:14,344 --> 00:08:17,047
Gonna invent the
guillotine in a hot second

172
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,686
if they don't get their shit together.

173
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:20,446
Everyone is doing their best, my queen.

174
00:08:20,471 --> 00:08:23,863
We expect to clear said water shortly.

175
00:08:23,888 --> 00:08:25,897
We're excessively optimistic.

176
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,300
Spare no expense.

177
00:08:27,325 --> 00:08:28,960
Which brings me to my point.

178
00:08:28,993 --> 00:08:31,890
Fixing the Wellspring is expensive.

179
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:33,630
War is expensive.

180
00:08:33,663 --> 00:08:36,999
And at this time, we do not
have the funds necessary...

181
00:08:37,024 --> 00:08:38,492
We're broke?

182
00:08:52,148 --> 00:08:54,045
It's magic residue.

183
00:08:54,317 --> 00:08:57,721
Probably from a ward around
the bank's underground vault.

184
00:08:57,754 --> 00:08:59,599
It's a regular bank.

185
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,593
Regular banks have magical wards?

186
00:09:02,627 --> 00:09:05,427
Ones connected to the
Federal Reserve do, yeah.

187
00:09:05,452 --> 00:09:08,286
Okay, so how do we get past it?

188
00:09:10,796 --> 00:09:13,432
- Shit, it's...
- The Haxenpaxen.

189
00:09:19,377 --> 00:09:21,346
Hey, we can't just let it out.

190
00:09:21,378 --> 00:09:23,080
If...

191
00:09:56,719 --> 00:09:58,115
What the fuck?

192
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:05,656
Oh, my God. What the hell? A spoon?

193
00:10:06,824 --> 00:10:08,192
I think it's dead.

194
00:10:08,224 --> 00:10:10,889
What the hell was it
besides huge and invisible?

195
00:10:11,762 --> 00:10:14,265
Fuck. We have to stop the bleeding.

196
00:10:25,636 --> 00:10:27,356
We should bury it properly.

197
00:10:27,381 --> 00:10:30,013
Okay, but, Jules, we got to move, okay?

198
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,417
We really need to get somewhere safe.

199
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,334
Okay, like?

200
00:10:35,452 --> 00:10:37,740
You're not gonna like it.

201
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,488
Have you seen. the "Twilight" movies?

202
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:57,626
Specifically the last one?

203
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,158
No.

204
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:02,040
Huh. That's probably for the best.

205
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:06,565
Your problems extend beyond your uterus.

206
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:10,031
The fetus' élan vital is...

207
00:11:10,056 --> 00:11:13,171
entangled with your soul.

208
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:14,708
I mean, I have read about this,

209
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,976
but I've... I've never
seen it in person.

210
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,711
You will need to find a Mudang.

211
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:20,513
It's their area.

212
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:23,582
Yeah, we did. She was expensive.

213
00:11:23,615 --> 00:11:25,151
Yeah, tell me about it.

214
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,868
I've been trying to get
one on staff for years.

215
00:11:38,918 --> 00:11:41,158
That poor girl is fucked.

216
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:43,967
And you are suggesting?

217
00:11:44,926 --> 00:11:46,406
Let her stay.

218
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,008
I know that you expelled Kady

219
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,444
and that you are not generally
keen on granting asylum,

220
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:52,012
especially to hedges.

221
00:11:52,052 --> 00:11:56,557
Yes, well, this is a special case.

222
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,137
Julia and I have a past.

223
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:03,022
Handle it however you
want, but for the record,

224
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,359
that girl will be safer at Brakebills.

225
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,040
Mm.

226
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,532
"How to transfer the
energy from one being

227
00:12:17,557 --> 00:12:20,895
"and transform it."

228
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:40,085
Hey, what... what are
you two doing here?

229
00:12:43,128 --> 00:12:44,414
What?

230
00:12:53,028 --> 00:12:55,505
What's this bitch doing in my room?

231
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,232
I know.

232
00:12:57,257 --> 00:12:59,232
This was her room, right?

233
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:02,907
I guess they haven't
moved her stuff yet,

234
00:13:02,932 --> 00:13:05,869
but Fogg said space was limited, so...

235
00:13:07,751 --> 00:13:09,218
I talked to Kady.

236
00:13:09,243 --> 00:13:11,180
What, no respect for the dead, Q?

237
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:13,857
You're just gonna let her sit on my bed?

238
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:16,951
Jules, I don't know what to say.

239
00:13:16,976 --> 00:13:18,630
Say what you're thinking.

240
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:20,400
That I'm cursed.

241
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,494
Must've been a serial
killer in a past life.

242
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,304
Yeah, raise your hand
if she's the reason

243
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,539
that you fucking exploded in this life.

244
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:28,443
I'm sorry for everything
that's happened.

245
00:13:28,468 --> 00:13:29,576
Yeah, speak for yourself.

246
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:30,889
For everything that
you're going through.

247
00:13:30,914 --> 00:13:32,701
Mm, now you're just lying to her, Q.

248
00:13:32,726 --> 00:13:34,786
I'm sorry. I'm just having a hard time.

249
00:13:34,811 --> 00:13:38,482
- Yeah, because you blame her.
- I'm not blaming you for Alice.

250
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:41,123
If I'm being honest.

251
00:13:41,148 --> 00:13:43,225
No, if I make you feel
so shitty, just go.

252
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,770
- No.
- Why?

253
00:13:44,795 --> 00:13:46,647
I'm the reason. If
I'm the reason, then...

254
00:13:46,672 --> 00:13:48,261
'Cause that doesn't feel right either.

255
00:13:48,293 --> 00:13:50,463
I don't know what's right.

256
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:54,939
My best friend in the
world does crazy shit

257
00:13:54,964 --> 00:13:56,670
and doesn't trust me
and doesn't listen to me.

258
00:13:56,703 --> 00:13:58,438
It is not that simple, and you know it.

259
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:01,373
I don't... What am I supposed to do?

260
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,310
You guys are both so goddamn maudlin.

261
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:19,872
I promised you, in Fillory,

262
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:23,597
when you told me about Reynard,
that I would help you somehow,

263
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,044
and that is not a promise

264
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:29,126
that I intend on breaking.

265
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,519
So if there's anything that I can do...

266
00:14:36,544 --> 00:14:38,279
Actually, there is.

267
00:14:39,878 --> 00:14:41,900
Help us rob a bank.

268
00:14:42,184 --> 00:14:43,979
Oh, my God, yes.

269
00:14:46,058 --> 00:14:47,861
You say yes.

270
00:14:50,355 --> 00:14:51,825
It's for Professor Mayakovsky!

271
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:54,861
It was destroyed by other books.

272
00:14:54,893 --> 00:14:56,595
"Future Movements of Magic"

273
00:14:56,628 --> 00:14:58,197
was written by a Polish scientist

274
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,765
who happened to be a...

275
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,103
What?

276
00:15:01,128 --> 00:15:02,602
Jew.

277
00:15:02,634 --> 00:15:05,171
So the eugenics books came for it.

278
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:06,473
I'm really sorry.

279
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:08,183
They've been put in
the restricted section

280
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,183
with the other anti-Semitic texts.

281
00:15:19,547 --> 00:15:20,985
Hey.

282
00:15:23,928 --> 00:15:25,586
I'm...

283
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:29,558
Long story.

284
00:15:32,193 --> 00:15:34,027
Anyway...

285
00:16:25,671 --> 00:16:27,840
There's our little king.

286
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,626
So how have you been since, um...

287
00:16:32,651 --> 00:16:35,154
Uh, I'm managing.

288
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:37,564
Um, how are things with you guys?

289
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:40,625
Glad you asked. We're at war.

290
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:44,804
Also, Fillory is seriously,
dangerously stone-cold broke.

291
00:16:44,836 --> 00:16:46,605
Wait, how is that even possible?

292
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:48,440
The Nugget Beetles of the Outer Islands,

293
00:16:48,474 --> 00:16:49,975
they literally shit precious stones.

294
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:51,744
Going extinct, apparently.

295
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:54,480
Ember shitting in the
power grid really screwed us

296
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,015
in a cornucopia of ways.

297
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:59,319
And before you ask, yes,
every alchemist in history

298
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:02,236
is a lying, cheating illusionist.

299
00:17:02,261 --> 00:17:04,323
They turn lead into gold.
It turns right back in a day.

300
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,760
So we are boned.

301
00:17:08,493 --> 00:17:11,365
How would you guys feel
about robbing a bank?

302
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:16,654
Whew.

303
00:17:18,542 --> 00:17:20,061
So...

304
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,303
what are you really up to?

305
00:17:29,442 --> 00:17:30,944
We need to rob a bank.

306
00:17:33,127 --> 00:17:36,064
A bank heist. Wow.

307
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:38,558
Hmm, I think the time
we've invested in him

308
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,892
may actually pay off.

309
00:17:39,926 --> 00:17:41,027
Mm-hmm.

310
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,971
Okay, first, there's
something I have to tell you.

311
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:46,632
You're not gonna like
it, but hear me out.

312
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:49,636
For Julia? The psychopath?

313
00:17:49,706 --> 00:17:52,225
The victim of a fucking rape

314
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,836
by a trickster god.

315
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:59,802
Look, I got to do this, okay? I owe her.

316
00:18:03,906 --> 00:18:05,041
So?

317
00:18:05,066 --> 00:18:08,925
You gonna ask the traveler you
just fucked the shit out of to help?

318
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:12,425
I mean, no, I didn't really
feel like I had the right.

319
00:18:12,457 --> 00:18:14,058
That's noble.

320
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,621
But ask.

321
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:20,973
Not gonna lie, I always
wanted to rob a bank.

322
00:18:30,112 --> 00:18:33,282
To our little thievery corporation.

323
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,154
PS, we still hate you.

324
00:18:38,209 --> 00:18:39,618
But it's the 21st century.

325
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:40,986
Shouldn't be this hard for a girl

326
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,821
to get an evil demigod abortion.

327
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,310
And we're emotionally advanced.

328
00:18:44,335 --> 00:18:47,232
We can hold resentment and sympathy
for a person at the same time.

329
00:18:47,257 --> 00:18:49,079
And Fillory's broke. We need gold.

330
00:18:49,104 --> 00:18:51,964
So lucky you.

331
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:53,324
Thank you.

332
00:18:53,349 --> 00:18:55,403
Okay, uh...

333
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,438
so if this heist is happening,

334
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,673
any ideas as to how?

335
00:19:01,289 --> 00:19:02,725
Well, we cased the bank.

336
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,383
There was a pretty gnarly
ward around the vault.

337
00:19:05,408 --> 00:19:07,844
Who here's actually robbed a bank?

338
00:19:09,514 --> 00:19:11,063
When was this?

339
00:19:11,088 --> 00:19:12,803
Senior year of high school.

340
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,921
I had some issues.

341
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:18,358
Okay, listen up,

342
00:19:18,383 --> 00:19:21,193
'cause I'm only gonna go
through this shit once.

343
00:19:21,218 --> 00:19:22,861
Any bank worth robbing

344
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,770
uses one of a handful
of security systems.

345
00:19:25,795 --> 00:19:27,734
All the usual bells and whistles.

346
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:29,856
But what most idiots don't know

347
00:19:29,881 --> 00:19:32,871
is, those companies are
all owned by Magicians.

348
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,874
Wait, so the people that work there...

349
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:38,049
Clueless. Tellers,
managers, security guards.

350
00:19:38,074 --> 00:19:39,221
They're all Muggles.

351
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:42,214
They have no idea the
vault has a secret feature.

352
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,649
Serious wards.

353
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:47,036
Designed specifically
to keep out Magicians.

354
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,418
Now, in the case of our target,

355
00:19:49,443 --> 00:19:52,419
their fingerprints
control the alarm systems.

356
00:19:53,513 --> 00:19:54,894
It takes two managers

357
00:19:54,926 --> 00:19:57,482
scanning their prints simultaneously

358
00:19:57,507 --> 00:19:58,598
to do this.

359
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,134
Once both the alarms
and the wards go down,

360
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:03,770
you've got ten minutes
to get downstairs,

361
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:05,308
past the armed guards,

362
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:08,181
and enter in the
correct ten-digit combo.

363
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:10,043
If you screw up the combination

364
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:12,078
or you take longer than ten minutes,

365
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,261
you're fucked.

366
00:20:13,286 --> 00:20:16,649
Now, basic bitches trip all
the standard alarm systems,

367
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:18,051
but Magicians?

368
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:22,254
We also trip the magic
wards, which means...

369
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:23,907
battle Magicians.

370
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:27,735
Full-time security employees
on the DL, with benefits.

371
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,762
You see one, run.

372
00:20:29,794 --> 00:20:32,599
They only ask questions post-mortem.

373
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,666
But our ace is you.

374
00:20:34,699 --> 00:20:37,736
Once we nab prints and drop the wards,

375
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,105
you travel straight in.

376
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:41,507
You really don't think a
bank vault, of all places,

377
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,176
has anti-traveler protection?

378
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,543
Oh, they do.

379
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:45,857
The entire floor of the vault

380
00:20:45,882 --> 00:20:47,947
is one big anti-traveling sigil.

381
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,817
You get locked in till
you run out of air.

382
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:53,953
Yeah. Pass. I like air.

383
00:20:53,985 --> 00:20:55,722
Relax, dummy.

384
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:58,131
You only get stuck if you hit the floor.

385
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:00,092
Oh, so it's like "Mission: Impossible."

386
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:02,829
That movie was stupidly unrealistic.

387
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:05,230
It's so much easier to just levitate.

388
00:21:05,263 --> 00:21:07,096
Yeah, I don't know how,

389
00:21:07,121 --> 00:21:08,854
and in case you guys have all forgotten,

390
00:21:08,879 --> 00:21:10,168
I can't do magic.

391
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,839
Oh, that's fine. This
is gonna get done to you.

392
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:14,510
It's a little thingy

393
00:21:14,535 --> 00:21:16,242
any Physical Kid can
make in their sleep.

394
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:18,043
Gravity belt. Exactly.

395
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:21,314
Once we drop the wards, float Penny,

396
00:21:21,347 --> 00:21:25,594
he zips in, he zips out... payday.

397
00:21:27,057 --> 00:21:28,621
Julia, run!

398
00:21:28,711 --> 00:21:30,447
It's there. You just don't see it. Go!

399
00:21:30,472 --> 00:21:32,291
- I thought it was dead.
- I guess it's got friends.

400
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:34,126
- Kady, come on.
- No, you go. I'll catch up.

401
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,687
- Kady!
- No! I need to kill it.

402
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:36,906
- I'll be fine.
- Why?

403
00:21:36,937 --> 00:21:39,164
- I need its spoon.
- Spoon?

404
00:21:52,335 --> 00:21:53,913
This is yours, isn't it?

405
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:56,332
You sent those things
after Julia, didn't you?

406
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:02,523
See, this is what happen
when you don't pay.

407
00:22:02,548 --> 00:22:03,687
Jehn-jang.

408
00:22:03,712 --> 00:22:06,259
- Lady, use your words.
- Dak-chuh!

409
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,047
This is for dokkaebi.

410
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:10,163
How you say... goblin.

411
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:11,363
Invisible, right?

412
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:12,961
- Yeah.
- Right.

413
00:22:12,986 --> 00:22:14,521
This is very old magic.

414
00:22:14,546 --> 00:22:16,882
You bring to life using
old, abandoned things,

415
00:22:16,907 --> 00:22:18,909
like this wooden spoon...

416
00:22:19,105 --> 00:22:20,562
and menstrual blood.

417
00:22:20,629 --> 00:22:22,359
Probably Moon's.

418
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,711
These creatures are mercenaries.

419
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:27,012
They won't stop.

420
00:22:27,045 --> 00:22:30,382
You kill one, another
one grows in its place.

421
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:31,783
Very fucked up.

422
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:33,353
Why the hell would she do that?

423
00:22:33,386 --> 00:22:34,753
To kill your friend.

424
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:36,389
I told Moon to relax,

425
00:22:36,422 --> 00:22:37,890
but she's all, "Baby's too evil.

426
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:39,913
"It might hurt more people."

427
00:22:39,938 --> 00:22:41,239
She wants to play it safe

428
00:22:41,264 --> 00:22:43,266
and kill both spawn and mom together.

429
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:44,863
She's so stupid.

430
00:22:44,897 --> 00:22:47,099
You won't pay if your friend is dead.

431
00:22:47,132 --> 00:22:49,746
Listen, we are trying to
get you the money, okay?

432
00:22:49,771 --> 00:22:51,812
If you want to get paid so fucking bad,

433
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:53,272
tell her to call it off.

434
00:22:53,304 --> 00:22:56,104
Can't. She has a hundred spoons.

435
00:22:56,129 --> 00:22:59,044
Dokkaebi will not stop
until trickster baby is dead,

436
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:00,847
so you got two options.

437
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,881
I can exorcise for you,

438
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:05,602
or monster rips your
friend's head off her neck.

439
00:23:05,627 --> 00:23:07,655
So hurry up with my gold.

440
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:21,938
Hey.

441
00:23:23,037 --> 00:23:24,439
What's that?

442
00:23:24,464 --> 00:23:25,698
You remember that one time

443
00:23:25,723 --> 00:23:27,715
Richard and the Free
Traders rewound time?

444
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,742
- DéjÃ  pizza?
- Yeah.

445
00:23:29,774 --> 00:23:31,824
I think this is how they did it.

446
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:35,248
That was heavy cooperative magic.

447
00:23:35,273 --> 00:23:38,176
Yeah, well, there are
notes for version 2.0 here.

448
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:40,820
I mean, it's more
efficient. Takes less juice.

449
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:42,754
Either one of us could run it.

450
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:44,452
Let's see.

451
00:23:48,828 --> 00:23:50,730
"The Quarterback"?

452
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,432
Goes back 15 seconds.

453
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:55,074
Get it? Quarter of a minute?

454
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:58,457
Yeah, Richard did like his dad jokes.

455
00:23:59,687 --> 00:24:02,049
Anyway, I thought it could be useful,

456
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:03,810
but at this rate,

457
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:05,911
I won't actually get
it to work for weeks.

458
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,946
And I guess I'd be weighed
down lugging it anyway.

459
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,916
It's got a pretty small
radius of influence.

460
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,540
Julia, you can't come.

461
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,704
What?

462
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:17,857
Those invisible blood-goblin things,

463
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:19,382
they won't stop coming.

464
00:24:19,407 --> 00:24:22,195
I mean, not until your problem's dead,

465
00:24:22,649 --> 00:24:25,618
meaning you are.

466
00:24:25,643 --> 00:24:27,800
If you step out from
under these wards...

467
00:24:27,832 --> 00:24:29,974
It'll find me and all of you.

468
00:24:31,209 --> 00:24:33,806
So I'm supposed to, what, just
wait here, fingers crossed,

469
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,808
while everyone who blames
me for Alice's death

470
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,943
risks their life?

471
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,607
I mean, how does that even make sense?

472
00:24:38,632 --> 00:24:41,503
Just 'cause you can't come
doesn't mean you can't be there.

473
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:46,218
You can listen in and watch.

474
00:24:50,334 --> 00:24:51,791
All right, but if anything goes wrong...

475
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,037
Nothing will. Okay?

476
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:08,794
Librarian, Neck Beard,
and White Privilege.

477
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:12,177
They're the managers. We
need two of their prints.

478
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:16,489
The good news is, they all go
to the same lame bar after work.

479
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:20,599
I'll take White Privilege.
Kady, you take Neck Beard.

480
00:25:21,005 --> 00:25:24,122
Oh, nut up. It's just a finger.

481
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:27,926
Walk up to him, grab his hand,
and say, "Can I borrow this?"

482
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,801
Dip his stupid finger in his drink

483
00:25:29,826 --> 00:25:31,935
to sanitize it, and...

484
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:36,101
pop it in your mouth, walk away,

485
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:39,052
yet stay emblazoned on
his heart for a lifetime.

486
00:25:39,077 --> 00:25:41,036
Done and done.

487
00:25:41,942 --> 00:25:42,949
Fine.

488
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:44,169
Why does it got to be Kady?

489
00:25:44,194 --> 00:25:45,978
It could be Penny or Eliot.

490
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:47,692
- Or you.
- Yeah.

491
00:25:48,028 --> 00:25:49,881
Sounded like volunteering.

492
00:25:49,915 --> 00:25:52,308
- Okay, fine, I'll take the librarian.
- Ha-ha.

493
00:25:52,333 --> 00:25:54,420
Great. Quentin will go in my place.

494
00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:56,081
Thanks, Q.

495
00:26:06,704 --> 00:26:10,981
So he really just stuck
that in your mouth?

496
00:26:11,006 --> 00:26:12,219
Yup.

497
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:15,349
That is how the spell works.

498
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:17,086
Damn.

499
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:23,515
Unexpectedly, I'm somehow
turned on right now.

500
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:25,412
Oh, really?

501
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:28,030
- Look at this idiot.
- Ugh.

502
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:30,546
Took you long enough.

503
00:26:31,815 --> 00:26:33,818
So show us the goods.

504
00:26:36,896 --> 00:26:38,196
Oh, God.

505
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,066
Oh, that's bad.

506
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:42,301
How'd you get it in your mouth?

507
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:46,426
Oh, it wasn't with your mouth, was it?

508
00:26:46,489 --> 00:26:47,724
- Wh...
- Oh!

509
00:26:47,749 --> 00:26:50,168
- Oh, shit!
- Mm-mm.

510
00:26:50,541 --> 00:26:52,778
She went Digital Underground?

511
00:26:52,803 --> 00:26:54,973
- Oh, God.
- Whoo!

512
00:26:55,179 --> 00:26:56,800
What else do we have to do?

513
00:26:56,825 --> 00:26:58,416
With these, we're golden.

514
00:26:58,449 --> 00:27:01,654
Margo and Eliot grabbed everything
else we need for the morning.

515
00:27:01,686 --> 00:27:04,022
So go rest up, Goldwater.

516
00:27:04,085 --> 00:27:05,817
You've earned it.

517
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,002
All right.

518
00:27:16,034 --> 00:27:18,403
Stick to the plan precisely,

519
00:27:18,436 --> 00:27:20,205
and we should be golden.

520
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:21,507
I'll be right here waiting,

521
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,642
engines running.

522
00:27:22,675 --> 00:27:24,143
Of course you will.

523
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:25,543
The brains of the operation

524
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:27,044
drives the getaway.

525
00:27:27,069 --> 00:27:29,536
- Everyone knows that.
- Of course.

526
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:33,684
Okay, bitches. Let's do this.

527
00:27:45,746 --> 00:27:48,205
- Thanks, Jimmy.
- Yeah.

528
00:28:07,549 --> 00:28:08,860
Ah!

529
00:28:27,077 --> 00:28:28,360
Good luck.

530
00:29:11,405 --> 00:29:14,041
All right. Let's set the clocks.

531
00:29:20,222 --> 00:29:21,434
Okay.

532
00:29:22,985 --> 00:29:24,988
Three, two, one.

533
00:29:28,322 --> 00:29:31,126
Okay. Alarms and wards are down.

534
00:29:31,158 --> 00:29:33,628
It's up to Penny now.

535
00:29:34,896 --> 00:29:36,264
Let's go.

536
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,577
Wait. Oh, shit. Um...

537
00:29:54,439 --> 00:29:55,816
Ha-ha.

538
00:30:02,715 --> 00:30:04,062
Oh, shit.

539
00:30:21,165 --> 00:30:22,374
Shit!

540
00:31:00,115 --> 00:31:02,119
God damn it.

541
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:04,541
Fuck.

542
00:31:05,003 --> 00:31:06,872
Fucking Physical Kids.

543
00:31:09,147 --> 00:31:11,733
Penny's only got one
minute. Where the hell is he?

544
00:31:12,726 --> 00:31:14,881
Cutting it a little
close, don't you think?

545
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,263
So where's the booty?

546
00:31:16,297 --> 00:31:17,699
Eliot, who are you talking to?

547
00:31:17,732 --> 00:31:19,608
They can't see me. I'm
not technically here.

548
00:31:19,633 --> 00:31:21,002
I'm incepting your ass!

549
00:31:21,036 --> 00:31:23,071
Your head. Your dreams.

550
00:31:23,104 --> 00:31:25,173
You're still asleep
in Fillory, remember?

551
00:31:25,205 --> 00:31:26,974
That is overly complicated.

552
00:31:27,008 --> 00:31:29,473
You know what's not?
The sigil I just touched

553
00:31:29,498 --> 00:31:31,646
'cause someone messed
up the buoyancy math.

554
00:31:31,678 --> 00:31:33,281
Oh, that is not good.

555
00:31:33,313 --> 00:31:34,864
Eliot, what's going on?

556
00:31:34,889 --> 00:31:37,019
How do I put this? Penny fucked up.

557
00:31:37,051 --> 00:31:39,286
No, it's your stupid
device. I'm stuck now.

558
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:41,155
Penny's incepting my... never mind.

559
00:31:41,188 --> 00:31:43,391
Just trust me, we have to
get him out of that vault now.

560
00:31:44,549 --> 00:31:47,269
Or, say, sometime in
the previous ten minutes.

561
00:31:47,294 --> 00:31:50,131
Fuck. Shit.

562
00:31:50,165 --> 00:31:51,867
Shit, let's go!

563
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:54,069
Tell her I'm fine. I'm
just... I'm running out of air.

564
00:31:54,101 --> 00:31:55,538
Well, way to mix the message.

565
00:31:59,473 --> 00:32:01,275
Hey, Margo, keep the engine running.

566
00:32:01,309 --> 00:32:02,411
I'll inform the bank manager

567
00:32:02,444 --> 00:32:04,491
the bees are resisting extermination

568
00:32:04,516 --> 00:32:06,380
and everyone needs to
stay clear a little longer.

569
00:32:06,414 --> 00:32:08,849
Let's go, kids. We're going back in.

570
00:32:23,197 --> 00:32:25,183
- Shh. Quiet.
- Stop it.

571
00:32:25,965 --> 00:32:27,533
You...

572
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,683
- you are bad.
- No, you're bad.

573
00:32:36,316 --> 00:32:37,945
- Oh, shit.
- What?

574
00:32:37,979 --> 00:32:40,269
- Guards.
- What? I thought they evacuated.

575
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:42,730
I got this. I brought
the perfect weapon.

576
00:32:42,755 --> 00:32:43,990
Wait, you're not gonna...

577
00:32:44,015 --> 00:32:45,928
Kill them? God, no.

578
00:32:45,953 --> 00:32:49,027
The Wrecking Ball is a weapon of peace.

579
00:32:49,257 --> 00:32:51,927
Trust me. I'm a genius.

580
00:32:53,494 --> 00:32:55,229
Read the book, and then
you watch the movie,

581
00:32:55,262 --> 00:32:56,464
and it's always just whiny.

582
00:32:58,366 --> 00:33:00,327
I'm totally disappointed in the book.

583
00:33:00,352 --> 00:33:01,677
Mind if I read you?

584
00:33:01,702 --> 00:33:03,101
Stop it.

585
00:33:03,126 --> 00:33:04,227
Stop it!

00:33:44,913 --> 00:33:47,883
at our cottage soirees,
but it came on a bit strong.

597
00:33:47,915 --> 00:33:49,217
Shit.

598
00:33:55,981 --> 00:33:57,689
There's no way we can pick this lock.

599
00:33:57,714 --> 00:33:59,261
Maybe we can brute-force it.

600
00:33:59,293 --> 00:34:03,264
Hold on. I think this door
is too thick, even for you.

601
00:34:03,298 --> 00:34:04,623
Okay, just so we're
all on the same page,

602
00:34:04,648 --> 00:34:06,248
we've got less than four minutes.

603
00:34:07,335 --> 00:34:10,099
Penny! We're getting you out!

604
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:12,755
I don't even think Alice could
do this in under four minutes.

605
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,083
Maybe not then, but
now I could do it in 15.

606
00:34:15,108 --> 00:34:16,411
Seconds.

607
00:34:16,444 --> 00:34:18,466
Oh, well. Rest in peace, Penny.

608
00:34:20,047 --> 00:34:21,896
Well, I guess I could help.

609
00:34:21,921 --> 00:34:23,427
For a price.

610
00:34:24,411 --> 00:34:25,851
I want to drive.

611
00:34:25,876 --> 00:34:28,063
For an hour a day, I
get control of your body.

612
00:34:28,088 --> 00:34:31,092
Okay, okay. Maybe we break
this up. We split up the work.

613
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:32,460
I don't even know where to start.

614
00:34:32,492 --> 00:34:34,029
Well, we can't just stand here!

615
00:34:34,061 --> 00:34:35,197
I wouldn't hurt anyone.

616
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,965
I just want to stretch the tiniest bit.

617
00:34:37,998 --> 00:34:39,203
Breathe.

618
00:34:39,392 --> 00:34:41,500
You set the terms. We could
even do a "word as bond"

619
00:34:41,525 --> 00:34:43,203
so that I can't break it.

620
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,768
Okay. 30 minutes. That's all you get.

621
00:34:47,793 --> 00:34:50,469
After we hash out the "word as bond."

622
00:34:50,993 --> 00:34:52,179
Great.

623
00:34:52,212 --> 00:34:53,547
You try anything crazy...

624
00:34:53,581 --> 00:34:55,250
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Box.

625
00:34:55,282 --> 00:34:56,518
Is it a deal?

626
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,918
Fine, it's a deal.

627
00:34:57,951 --> 00:34:59,486
Are you talking to yourself?

628
00:35:00,176 --> 00:35:02,792
No. Yes. Uh...

629
00:35:04,042 --> 00:35:06,893
Yes. I'm just... I'm doing
long division in my head.

630
00:35:06,918 --> 00:35:08,839
Move. Move.

631
00:35:39,661 --> 00:35:42,030
I've always been good at math.

632
00:35:43,331 --> 00:35:46,001
- Hi. You okay?
- Oh, shit. Yeah, I'm okay.

633
00:35:46,034 --> 00:35:47,168
- Okay.
- All right.

634
00:35:47,201 --> 00:35:48,683
Princess rescued.

635
00:35:48,708 --> 00:35:51,110
Let's collect our reward and go.

636
00:35:57,545 --> 00:35:59,313
Yes!

637
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:04,019
Oh, shit.

638
00:36:05,258 --> 00:36:07,227
Q, stop! Oh!

639
00:36:07,252 --> 00:36:08,489
Shit! Oh, no.

640
00:36:43,257 --> 00:36:44,927
- Let's go!
- Come on.

641
00:36:45,809 --> 00:36:47,078
Okay.

642
00:36:47,362 --> 00:36:48,997
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

643
00:36:49,029 --> 00:36:51,065
Go back! Go back! Go back!

644
00:36:58,558 --> 00:37:00,638
Shit.

645
00:37:02,342 --> 00:37:05,246
Oh, shit, shit, shit!

646
00:37:10,505 --> 00:37:12,057
Well, why should I go out there first?

647
00:37:12,082 --> 00:37:13,698
You're the battle Magician.

648
00:37:13,723 --> 00:37:15,432
What about another Wrecking Ball?

649
00:37:15,457 --> 00:37:17,224
It was a one-off.

650
00:37:21,367 --> 00:37:23,102
Oh, shit.

651
00:37:25,953 --> 00:37:28,690
You're the... the battle Magician.

652
00:37:28,715 --> 00:37:31,108
- Wait, did we just...
- Go back in time?

653
00:37:31,133 --> 00:37:33,140
Yeah. Julia?

654
00:37:33,174 --> 00:37:35,264
I'm outside. I can see
you in the van's mirror.

655
00:37:35,289 --> 00:37:37,428
The effect reaches far enough?

656
00:37:37,931 --> 00:37:39,756
Listen, you only have four rewinds.

657
00:37:39,781 --> 00:37:40,920
Julia's outside.

658
00:37:40,945 --> 00:37:43,347
She's watching with a
machine that can rewind time.

659
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:54,565
Let's go!

660
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,008
You're the...

661
00:38:00,033 --> 00:38:01,903
Kady, three rewinds left.

662
00:38:01,928 --> 00:38:03,526
She can only go back 15 seconds.

663
00:38:03,551 --> 00:38:04,698
Let's go!

664
00:38:12,328 --> 00:38:14,824
- You're the...
- Two rewinds left.

665
00:38:23,403 --> 00:38:24,675
Penny!

666
00:38:25,355 --> 00:38:26,828
Kady, last rewind.

667
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,292
Okay, look. We need a plan.

668
00:38:28,317 --> 00:38:30,705
Okay. Okay, I'll blast the bitch.

669
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:32,261
You all run left. She's
always on the right.

670
00:38:32,286 --> 00:38:34,413
Is she? 'Cause the last time, I
thought she was more in the middle.

671
00:38:34,438 --> 00:38:36,240
15 seconds!

672
00:38:47,139 --> 00:38:48,274
Let's go.

673
00:38:55,279 --> 00:38:56,759
Kady!

674
00:38:59,947 --> 00:39:01,321
Julia.

675
00:39:02,163 --> 00:39:03,732
Julia, answer me.

676
00:39:04,773 --> 00:39:06,908
Shit. Let's go.

677
00:39:07,675 --> 00:39:09,142
Q, come on. Grab the bar.

678
00:39:09,167 --> 00:39:11,728
- But...
- Grab the bar! Let's go!

679
00:39:11,753 --> 00:39:13,203
- What about...
- It's clay.

680
00:39:13,228 --> 00:39:14,932
Eliot's fine. Let's go!

681
00:39:16,629 --> 00:39:17,979
Eliot?

682
00:39:18,113 --> 00:39:20,705
Eliot! Eliot!

683
00:39:21,307 --> 00:39:22,650
Guards!

684
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:41,828
Julia. Are you okay?

685
00:39:41,853 --> 00:39:43,922
Jules. Julia?

686
00:39:43,994 --> 00:39:45,961
- Talk to me.
- Julia, stay with us.

687
00:39:45,986 --> 00:39:47,206
Talk to me. Are you all right?

688
00:39:47,231 --> 00:39:48,399
It's gonna be fine.
We're gonna get help.

689
00:39:48,432 --> 00:39:49,901
- It's gonna be okay.
- Julia.

690
00:39:49,934 --> 00:39:51,402
- Julia.
- Come on. Hey.

691
00:39:51,436 --> 00:39:53,572
- Julia.
- Jules, stay with us. Come on.

692
00:39:53,604 --> 00:39:55,140
Julia?

693
00:40:04,538 --> 00:40:05,873
Hey.

694
00:40:08,649 --> 00:40:10,963
No, don't move around too much.

695
00:40:11,182 --> 00:40:14,205
Sun patched you up, but
it's gonna take a while.

696
00:40:16,346 --> 00:40:18,263
Did she do it?

697
00:40:18,994 --> 00:40:21,408
Did it work? Is it gone?

698
00:40:21,944 --> 00:40:23,680
Yeah.

699
00:40:23,705 --> 00:40:25,533
She did it.

700
00:40:26,312 --> 00:40:28,403
But, Julia...

701
00:40:30,317 --> 00:40:32,364
there was a complication.

703
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:44,356
- What's wrong with you?
- Lock it up, Q. Seriously!

704
00:40:45,012 --> 00:40:47,382
I can't help Fillory.

705
00:40:47,422 --> 00:40:48,664
I can't help Eliot.

706
00:40:48,689 --> 00:40:50,117
Please, wake up!

707
00:40:50,142 --> 00:40:52,773
- I can't help Julia, and I just want...
- Shut up! Shut up!
