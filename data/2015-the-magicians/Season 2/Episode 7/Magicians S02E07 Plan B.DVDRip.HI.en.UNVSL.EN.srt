you up for eternity.

Kind of boxed up
right now. In you.

robbed a bank?

353
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:15,819
When was this?

354
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:18,115
Senior year of high school.

355
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,214
(INHALES)

356
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:20,782
I had some issues.

357
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,261
Okay, listen up,

358
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:26,163
'cause I'm only going to
go through this shit once.

359
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:30,960
<i>Any bank worth robbing uses
one of a handful of security systems.</i>

360
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:32,972
<i>All the usual
bells and whistles.</i>

361
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,940
<i>But what most idiots don't know</i>

362
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:38,205
<i>is those companies are
all owned by Magicians.</i>

363
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:39,643
So the people that work there...

364
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:40,907
Clueless.

365
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,882
Tellers, managers, security
guards, they're all Muggles.

366
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:47,408
They have no idea the
vault has a secret feature.

367
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:48,818
Serious wards.

368
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:51,858
Designed specifically
to keep out Magicians.

369
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:54,454
<i>Now, in the case of our target,</i>

370
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,156
<i>their fingerprints control
the alarm systems.</i>

371
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:03,529
<i>It takes two managers scanning
their prints simultaneously to do this.</i>

372
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:06,333
<i>Once both the alarms
and the wards go down,</i>

373
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,874
<i>you've got 10 minutes
to get downstairs,</i>

374
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:13,037
<i>past the armed guards, and
enter in the correct 10-digit combo.</i>

375
00:20:13,512 --> 00:20:15,413
<i>If you screw up the combination</i>

376
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:18,178
<i>or you take longer than
10 minutes, you're fucked.</i>

377
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:21,618
Now basic bitches trip all
the standard alarm systems,

378
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:25,317
but Magicians, we also
trip the magic wards,

379
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:28,691
which means Battle Magicians.

380
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:32,823
Full-time security employees
on the D.L. with benefits.

381
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,730
You see one, run.

382
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,463
They only ask
questions post-mortem.

383
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,698
But our ace is you.

384
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:44,107
Once we nab prints and drop
the wards, you travel straight in.

385
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:45,576
You really don't
think a bank vault,

386
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:48,206
of all places, has
anti-Traveler protection?

387
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,543
MARGO: Oh, they do.

388
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:52,983
The entire floor of the vault
is one big anti-Traveling sigil.

389
00:20:53,052 --> 00:20:55,988
You're locked in
till you run out of air.

390
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:58,854
Yeah, pass. I like air.

391
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:02,918
Relax, dummy. You only
get stuck if you hit the floor.

392
00:21:02,995 --> 00:21:05,191
Oh, so it's like
<i>Mission Impossible.</i>

393
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,859
That movie was
stupidly unrealistic.

394
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,266
It's so much easier
to just levitate.

395
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:13,864
Yeah, I don't know how, and in
case you guys have all forgotten,

396
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,339
I can't do magic.

397
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:17,899
Oh, that's fine. This is
gonna get done to you.

398
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:21,641
It's a little thingy any Physical
Kid can make in their sleep.

399
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:23,182
MARGO: Gravity Belt. Exactly.

400
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:26,378
Once we drop the
wards, float Penny,

401
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:29,945
he zips in, he zips out, payday.

402
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:31,656
(SCREECHING)

403
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:33,223
KADY: Julia, run!

404
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:35,319
It's there. You just
don't see it. Go!

405
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:36,418
I thought it was dead.

406
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:37,572
My guess, it's got friends.

407
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:39,428
Kady, come on. No.
You go. I'll catch up.

408
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:41,176
Kady... No, I need
to kill it. I'll be fine.

409
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,793
Why? I need its spoon.

410
00:21:42,902 --> 00:21:43,995
Spoon?

411
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,184
KADY: This is yours, isn't it?

412
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:02,221
You sent those things
after Julia, didn't you?

413
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:04,185
(SPEAKING KOREAN)

414
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,727
See? This is what
happens when you don't pay.

415
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:09,818
(SPEAKING KOREAN)

416
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:10,919
Lady. Use your words.

417
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,259
What the... (SPEAKING KOREAN)

418
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:14,396
This is for a <i>dokkaebi.</i>

419
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:17,368
How you say,
goblin? Invisible, right?

420
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,234
Yeah. Right.

421
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:20,671
This is very old magic.

422
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:24,335
You bring to life, using old, abandoned
things like this wooden spoon.

423
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:26,337
And menstrual blood.

424
00:22:26,412 --> 00:22:27,903
Probably Moon's.

425
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:33,047
These creatures are
mercenaries. They won't stop.

426
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:36,555
You kill one, another
one grows in its place.

427
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:37,783
Very fucked up.

428
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,450
Why the hell would she do that?

429
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:40,823
To kill your friend.

430
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:44,227
I told Moon to relax, but
she's all, "Baby's too evil.

431
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,356
"It might hurt more people."

432
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:49,596
She wants to play it safe and
kill both spawn and mom together.

433
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:51,000
She's so stupid.

434
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,505
You won't pay if
your friend is dead.

435
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:56,132
Listen, we're trying to
get you the money, okay?

436
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,235
If you wanna get paid so
fucking bad, tell her to call it off.

437
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:02,247
Can't. She has 100 spoons.

438
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:05,216
<i>Dokkaebi</i> will not stop
until trickster baby is dead.

439
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:07,116
So, you got two options.

440
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:09,121
I can exorcise for you

441
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:11,589
or a monster rips your
friend's head off her neck.

442
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,416
So, hurry up with my gold.

443
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:24,335
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

444
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:27,739
Hey.

445
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:30,708
Is that...

446
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:33,871
You remember that one time Richard
and the Free Traders rewound time?

447
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:35,812
Déjà pizza? Yeah.

448
00:23:35,881 --> 00:23:37,349
I think this is how they did it.

449
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:41,579
That was heavy
cooperative magic.

450
00:23:41,654 --> 00:23:44,624
Yeah, well, there are
notes for version 2.0 here.

451
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,023
I mean, it's more
efficient, takes less juice.

452
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:49,220
Either one of us could run it.

453
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:51,321
Let's see.

454
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:56,868
"The Quarterback?"

455
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:59,565
It goes back 15 seconds, get it?

456
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:00,662
Quarter of a minute?

457
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:04,536
Yeah, Richard did like his
dad jokes. (CHUCKLES)

458
00:24:06,078 --> 00:24:09,242
Anyway, I thought
it could be useful,

459
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:12,114
but at this rate I won't
actually get it to work for weeks.

460
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:14,551
And I guess I'd be weighed
down lugging it anyway,

461
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,215
it's got a pretty small
radius of influence.

462
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:18,780
Julia, you can't come.

463
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:21,587
What?

464
00:24:22,361 --> 00:24:25,388
Those invisible blood-goblin
things, they won't stop coming.

465
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:28,229
Not until your problem's dead.

466
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:30,961
Meaning you are.

467
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,003
If you step out from
under these wards...

468
00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:36,804
It'll find me and
all of you. Right.

469
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:40,039
So, I'm supposed to what?
Just wait here? Fingers crossed?

470
00:24:40,112 --> 00:24:42,911
While everyone who blames
me for Alice's death risks their life?

471
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,462
I mean, how does
that even make sense?

472
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:48,446
Just 'cause you can't come
doesn't mean you can't be there.

473
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:52,783
You can listen in and watch.

474
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:57,939
All right. But if
anything goes wrong...

475
00:24:57,963 --> 00:24:59,693
Nothing will, okay?

476
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:15,203
MARGO: Librarian, Neck
Beard, and White Privilege.

477
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,407
They're the managers.

478
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:18,474
We need two of their prints.

479
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:22,817
The good news is, they all go
to the same lame bar after work.

480
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:26,653
I'll take White Privilege.
Kady, you take Neck Beard.

481
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,022
Oh, nut up. It's just a finger.

482
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:34,055
Walk up to him, grab his hand,
and say, "Can I borrow this?"

483
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:37,501
Dip his stupid finger
in his drink to sanitize it,

484
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:41,239
and pop it in your mouth.

485
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:45,141
Walk away yet stay emblazoned
on his heart for a lifetime.

486
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,042
Done and done.

487
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,339
Fine.

488
00:25:49,415 --> 00:25:51,941
Why's it got to be Kady?
It could be Penny or Eliot.

489
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:53,076
Or you.

490
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:56,247
Yeah, sounded like volunteering.

491
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:58,381
Okay, fine. I'll take the
Librarian. (LAUGHS)

492
00:25:58,457 --> 00:26:02,053
Great. Quentin will go
in my place. Thanks, Q.

493
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:17,103
So, he really just stuck
that in your mouth?

494
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:18,200
KADY: Yup.

495
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:21,577
That is how the spell works.

496
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:22,876
Damn.

497
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:29,678
Unexpectedly, I am
somehow turned on right now.

498
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:31,450
Oh, really?

499
00:26:32,124 --> 00:26:33,319
Look at this idiot.

500
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:34,492
(GROANS)

501
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,394
Took you long enough.

502
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,561
So show us the goods.

503
00:26:42,835 --> 00:26:44,463
(QUENTIN SIGHS)
KADY: (LAUGHS) Oh, God!

504
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,266
(LAUGHS) Oh, that's bad.

505
00:26:46,572 --> 00:26:48,336
PENNY: How'd you
get it in your mouth?

506
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:51,905
Oh, it wasn't with
your mouth, was it?

507
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:53,904
Oh.

508
00:26:53,979 --> 00:26:56,346
(LAUGHS) Oh, shit.

509
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:58,748
(SNORTS) She went
digital underground?

510
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:00,581
KADY: Oh, God. PENNY: Whoo!

511
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,982
What else do we have to do?

512
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:04,785
With these, we're golden.

513
00:27:04,857 --> 00:27:07,986
Margo and Eliot grabbed everything
else we need for the morning.

514
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,926
So go rest up, Coldwater.

515
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:12,192
You've earned it.

516
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:26,243
MARGO: <i>All right. Stick to the plan,
precisely, and we should be golden.</i>

517
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,780
I'll be right here
waiting. Engines running.

518
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:30,213
Of course you will.

519
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:33,218
The brains of the operation
drives the getaway.

520
00:27:33,285 --> 00:27:34,514
Everyone knows that.

521
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:35,781
Of course.

522
00:27:36,622 --> 00:27:38,853
Okay, bitches, let's do this.

523
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:54,206

703
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:54,858
KADY: Talk to me.
QUENTIN: Julia, stay with us.

704
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:56,203
KADY: Talk to me.
Are you all right?

705
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,338
QUENTIN: (ECHOING) It's
gonna be fine. We're gonna be okay.

706
00:39:57,362 --> 00:39:58,939
KADY: It's gonna be
okay. QUENTIN: Julia?

707
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:00,727
KADY: Julia?

708
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:02,494
QUENTIN: Jules,
stay with us. Come on.

709
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,729
KADY: Julia.

710
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,602
KADY: Hey.

711
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:19,483
Don't move around too much.

712
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,781
Sun patched you up,
but it's gonna take a while.

713
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:27,281
Did she do it?

714
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:28,849
Did it work? Is it gone?

715
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:33,088
Yeah, she did it.

716
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:36,198
But, Julia,

717
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:39,735
there was a complication.

718
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:44,932
