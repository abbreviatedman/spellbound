1
00:00:01,008 --> 00:00:02,891
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:04,579 --> 00:00:06,515
They know everything...

3
00:00:06,547 --> 00:00:08,817
who you are, what you have done.

4
00:00:08,851 --> 00:00:10,185
You cannot go back.

5
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:11,653
What am I supposed to do?

6
00:00:11,686 --> 00:00:13,054
What we all do.

7
00:00:13,088 --> 00:00:14,824
Decide.

8
00:00:16,336 --> 00:00:18,593
- Hey, where's Kady?
- Who gives a shit?

9
00:00:18,626 --> 00:00:21,062
I don't think Penny even
cares that she's gone.

10
00:00:21,095 --> 00:00:24,375
Believe me, he does.

11
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:26,508
We're gonna make another you.

12
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:29,038
You sleep here, your
mind goes into the golem.

13
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,586
The test was positive.

14
00:00:36,611 --> 00:00:37,745
I want an abortion.

15
00:00:37,778 --> 00:00:39,748
It's a totally mundane procedure.

16
00:00:39,781 --> 00:00:41,004
Is it?

17
00:00:41,029 --> 00:00:44,120
'Cause it might not be a simple,
totally mundane human embryo.

18
00:00:44,145 --> 00:00:46,154
Stop. What are you doing? Stop! Kady!

19
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:49,954
So sorry about this.

20
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,628
That's my Haxenpaxen!

21
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,313
Just imagine what it's
giving off magically.

22
00:00:55,338 --> 00:00:57,735
We're invisible while we're near him.

23
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,103
- Kady!
- Your magic is no good here.

24
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,781
What's with Stink-master Flash?

25
00:01:05,843 --> 00:01:08,042
- He's coming with us.
- It's my mom's contact.

26
00:01:08,075 --> 00:01:10,044
She could help with the baby situation.

27
00:01:10,078 --> 00:01:12,114
They may be able to help
your friend with her problem,

28
00:01:12,146 --> 00:01:15,059
but listen, I would never,
ever do business with them

29
00:01:15,084 --> 00:01:16,216
if I had a choice.

30
00:01:16,241 --> 00:01:18,887
Your majesties, the
much-venerated Emissaries

31
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,622
of our neighbors to the north.

32
00:01:20,655 --> 00:01:24,217
I present Prince Ess of Loria.

33
00:01:26,161 --> 00:01:29,031
- You fucked with us.
- Mm-hmm. Yes, you did.

34
00:01:29,063 --> 00:01:31,566
- You fucked with our castle.
- Amen, sister.

35
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:33,792
And now the High King and I

36
00:01:33,817 --> 00:01:37,472
hereby declare war on
the kingdom of Loria.

37
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:38,769
Yes!

38
00:01:38,794 --> 00:01:41,109
Wait, really?

39
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:43,546
I cast the niffin summoning,
and you didn't come.

40
00:01:43,578 --> 00:01:46,281
You're wrong. I was right there.

41
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:48,580
I killed you. My cacodemon...

42
00:01:48,605 --> 00:01:51,378
Your cacodemon wasn't
powerful enough to kill me.

43
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:52,772
It tried.

44
00:01:52,805 --> 00:01:54,307
But when it saw that it couldn't win,

45
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,775
well, let's just say it

46
00:01:55,808 --> 00:01:58,244
stuffed me in a place most convenient...

47
00:01:58,278 --> 00:02:01,014
that stupid tattoo trap on your back.

48
00:02:01,046 --> 00:02:02,884
We're stuck with each other.

49
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:04,195
Oh, Quentin.

50
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,353
We're gonna have so much fun.

51
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,598
Stop ignoring me! Stop
ignoring me, you pussy!

52
00:02:26,698 --> 00:02:28,573
Pay attention to me,
you miserable sad sack!

53
00:02:28,574 --> 00:02:30,886
- What's wrong with you?
- Stop it!

54
00:02:33,718 --> 00:02:36,089
Are you ready to let me out
of that hairy back of yours?

55
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:37,398
'Cause I'm never gonna stop.

56
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:39,126
And sooner or later,
one of these dummies

57
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,913
are gonna call the brain
police, and you got priors.

58
00:02:43,034 --> 00:02:44,937
This is not Alice. This is not Alice.

59
00:02:44,962 --> 00:02:47,064
This is not Alice. This is not Alice.

60
00:02:47,089 --> 00:02:49,392
Just keep telling yourself that.

61
00:02:49,537 --> 00:02:51,239
You have got to stop.

62
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:54,309
Fine. Let me out of
this trap, and I'm gone.

63
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:57,041
Okay, look, Alice...

64
00:02:57,345 --> 00:03:00,533
Evil Thing Inside of Me
That Used to Be Alice...

65
00:03:00,658 --> 00:03:03,695
I have to say the
words to open the trap.

66
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:05,887
Of my own volition. Out loud.

67
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,221
And I'm not going to do that

68
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,357
because there is one
policy for you out here,

69
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,059
and it is to box you up for eternity.

70
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:13,831
I'm kind of boxed up right now, in you.

71
00:03:13,856 --> 00:03:16,995
It's not the same
thing, and you know it.

72
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:20,370
Block of wood isn't
trying to fix this. I am.

73
00:03:20,395 --> 00:03:23,866
Save me? Is that what
you think you're doing?

74
00:03:23,891 --> 00:03:25,273
You think I want that?

75
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,907
I think if you were
really you right now,

76
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:28,209
that's all you would want.

77
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,610
Oh, what, and you're the world's

78
00:03:29,644 --> 00:03:31,012
foremost expert on all things me?

79
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,145
Based on what?

80
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:33,914
Our garbage fire of a relationship

81
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:35,650
that ended with Eliot's
dick in your mouth?

82
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,084
Look, you came really close

83
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:38,353
to fixing this once for your brother.

84
00:03:38,386 --> 00:03:39,651
I thought I did.

85
00:03:39,676 --> 00:03:41,089
But I was like you then.

86
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:42,923
Small yet weirdly arrogant

87
00:03:42,965 --> 00:03:45,035
for somebody who didn't
understand magic at all.

88
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,096
If you would just work with
me instead of jabbing at me,

89
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:49,530
we could figure out what's missing.

90
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,964
We could make the spell work.

91
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,299
We could do this.

92
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,501
Listen to me.

93
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:57,875
I promise, the math
will never add up, Q.

94
00:03:58,106 --> 00:04:00,508
You'll never get that girl back.

95
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:04,645
Everything that's missing
burnt up when I became this.

96
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:07,414
It's gone forever, Q.

97
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:09,450
This isn't good for either of us.

98
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:13,154
No, no, this is making
me saner by the second.

99
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,388
I don't want to hurt you.

100
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:16,157
I actually don't want to hurt anyone.

101
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,373
Bullshit, you're a niffin.

102
00:04:17,398 --> 00:04:18,809
Q, I'm not bloodthirsty.

103
00:04:18,834 --> 00:04:20,395
I just want to be free.

104
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,497
And I already told you I can't do that.

105
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,743
Fine. Just let me take over your body

106
00:04:25,768 --> 00:04:27,434
for just the tiniest little bit.

107
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,681
I'll be good. I'll be so good.

108
00:04:29,797 --> 00:04:31,751
No, that's crazy.

109
00:04:31,776 --> 00:04:34,727
So I have to be a niffin, yet
I don't even get to be a niffin?

110
00:04:34,752 --> 00:04:36,181
I could travel the universe.

111
00:04:36,206 --> 00:04:37,540
I could see things you
couldn't even imagine,

112
00:04:37,565 --> 00:04:40,615
but instead, I have to be
bored and stuck with you!

113
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:43,184
I'm sorry that it is torture
to be with the one person

114
00:04:43,217 --> 00:04:44,551
who is trying to help you.

115
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:48,022
So go back to screaming
until you go insane?

116
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,090
- Is that your choice?
- No.

117
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,842
That's your choice.

118
00:04:51,867 --> 00:04:54,124
Or you could be quiet.

119
00:05:00,365 --> 00:05:03,274
And you can let me try and solve this.

120
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,211
Well, this is the place.

121
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:23,307
Of course it is. Why wouldn't it be?

122
00:05:23,332 --> 00:05:25,947
I mean, Goldie said they're legit.

123
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:29,542
Only one way to find out.

124
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:10,128
- Problem?
- No problem.

125
00:06:10,153 --> 00:06:13,273
We're just discussing how
to handle your situation.

126
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,909
That's okay. My way is best way.

127
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:18,246
But you can abort it, right?

128
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:20,447
This is exorcism.

129
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:22,417
That thing is not human.

130
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,085
The longer it's inside you,

131
00:06:24,118 --> 00:06:25,787
the more tangled it
gets with your essence

132
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,522
and the harder it is for me to help you,

133
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,197
you understand?

134
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,543
Okay.

135
00:06:31,568 --> 00:06:33,635
Then I exorcise the trickster for you.

136
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,768
After you pay. Thank you.

137
00:06:43,485 --> 00:06:45,122
$1 million?

138
00:06:45,147 --> 00:06:46,840
In gold.

139
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,309
Paper money is for
drug dealers and idiots.

140
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:50,677
Look, Goldie will tell
you I'm good for it.

141
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,513
Can you just do it now
and we'll pay you later?

142
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:54,816
Bars. Two big bars.

143
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:56,440
Maybe 60 pounds.

144
00:06:56,465 --> 00:06:57,773
That's all.

145
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:03,723
What?

146
00:07:03,926 --> 00:07:05,560
No, I'm just... I'm trying to remember

147
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,294
the last time not having enough money

148
00:07:07,328 --> 00:07:08,996
was one of my biggest problems.

149
00:07:09,021 --> 00:07:12,038
Okay, well, cash won't cut it, so, what,

150
00:07:12,225 --> 00:07:13,667
pawnshops?

151
00:07:13,835 --> 00:07:17,104
A million dollars in
chains and earrings?

152
00:07:17,138 --> 00:07:19,944
I mean, that would
take so many pawnshops.

153
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,374
We might as well rob a bank.

154
00:07:23,957 --> 00:07:26,093
Well, we are Magicians.

155
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:29,651
Why don't we just rob a bank?

156
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:46,055
So there's really no way to just...

157
00:07:47,032 --> 00:07:49,203
take it all back?

158
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:52,340
Your Majesty, one
cannot simply take back

159
00:07:52,365 --> 00:07:54,430
- a declaration of war.
- Good.

160
00:07:54,455 --> 00:07:56,329
Because I don't.

161
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:59,212
There are Lorian troops
marching to the border.

162
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:00,448
They're days away.

163
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:02,650
We believe they intend
to penetrate Fillory

164
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:04,619
by way of the Grudge Gap.

165
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:06,787
And, of course, our
preparation is affected

166
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,758
by the continued...
unsteadiness of the Wellspring.

167
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,924
Okay, well, we've got
literally every engineer

168
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:15,929
in the kingdom working to
de-shit-inate the Wellspring.

169
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,665
Gonna invent the
guillotine in a hot second

170
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,304
if they don't get their shit together.

171
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:22,064
Everyone is doing their best, my queen.

172
00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:25,481
We expect to clear said water shortly.

173
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:27,515
We're excessively optimistic.

174
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,918
Spare no expense.

175
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:30,578
Which brings me to my point.

176
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:33,508
Fixing the Wellspring is expensive.

177
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:35,248
War is expensive.

178
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:38,617
And at this time, we do not
have the funds necessary...

179
00:08:38,642 --> 00:08:40,110
We're broke?

180
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,663
It's magic residue.

181
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:59,339
Probably from a ward around
the bank's underground vault.

182
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,217
It's a regular bank.

183
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:04,211
Regular banks have magical wards?

184
00:09:04,245 --> 00:09:07,045
Ones connected to the
Federal Reserve do, yeah.

185
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,904
Okay, so how do we get past it?

186
00:09:12,414 --> 00:09:15,050
- Shit, it's...
- The Haxenpaxen.

187
00:09:20,995 --> 00:09:22,964
Hey, we can't just let it out.

188
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:24,698
If...

189
00:09:58,337 --> 00:09:59,733
What the fuck?

190
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:07,274
Oh, my God. What the hell? A spoon?

191
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:09,810
I think it's dead.

192
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:12,507
What the hell was it
besides huge and invisible?

193
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,883
Fuck. We have to stop the bleeding.

194
00:10:27,254 --> 00:10:28,974
We should bury it properly.

195
00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:31,631
Okay, but, Jules, we got to move, okay?

196
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:34,035
We really need to get somewhere safe.

197
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:35,952
Okay, like?

198
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,358
You're not gonna like it.

199
00:10:57,441 --> 00:10:59,209
Have you seen the "Twilight" movies?

200
00:10:59,243 --> 00:11:01,347
Specifically the last one?

201
00:11:01,811 --> 00:11:02,879
No.

202
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:05,761
Huh. That's probably for the best.

203
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:10,286
Your problems extend beyond your uterus.

204
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,752
The fetus' élan vital is...

205
00:11:13,777 --> 00:11:16,892
entangled with your soul.

206
00:11:17,194 --> 00:11:18,429
I mean, I have read about this,

207
00:11:18,461 --> 00:11:20,697
but I've... I've never
seen it in person.

208
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,432
You will need to find a Mudang.

209
00:11:22,465 --> 00:11:24,234
It's their area.

210
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:27,303
Yeah, we did. She was expensive.

211
00:11:27,336 --> 00:11:28,872
Yeah, tell me about it.

212
00:11:28,906 --> 00:11:31,589
I've been trying to get
one on staff for years.

213
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:44,879
That poor girl is fucked.

214
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,688
And you are suggesting?

215
00:11:48,647 --> 00:11:50,127
Let her stay.

216
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,729
I know that you expelled Kady

217
00:11:51,762 --> 00:11:54,165
and that you are not generally
keen on granting asylum,

218
00:11:54,198 --> 00:11:55,733
especially to hedges.

219
00:11:55,773 --> 00:12:00,278
Yes, well, this is a special case.

220
00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:02,858
Julia and I have a past.

221
00:12:03,206 --> 00:12:06,743
Handle it however you
want, but for the record,

222
00:12:06,777 --> 00:12:09,080
that girl will be safer at Brakebills.

223
00:12:09,113 --> 00:12:10,761
Mm.

224
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,253
"How to transfer the
energy from one being

225
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:24,616
"and transform it."

226
00:12:40,935 --> 00:12:43,806
Hey, what... what are
you two doing here?

227
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,135
What?

228
00:12:56,749 --> 00:12:59,226
What's this bitch doing in my room?

229
00:12:59,461 --> 00:13:00,953
I know.

230
00:13:00,978 --> 00:13:02,953
This was her room, right?

231
00:13:05,035 --> 00:13:06,628
I guess they haven't
moved her stuff yet,

232
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:09,590
but Fogg said space was limited, so...

233
00:13:11,472 --> 00:13:12,939
I talked to Kady.

234
00:13:12,964 --> 00:13:14,901
What, no respect for the dead, Q?

235
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:17,578
You're just gonna let her sit on my bed?

236
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:20,672
Jules, I don't know what to say.

237
00:13:20,697 --> 00:13:22,351
Say what you're thinking.

238
00:13:22,386 --> 00:13:24,121
That I'm cursed.

239
00:13:24,146 --> 00:13:26,215
Must've been a serial
killer in a past life.

240
00:13:26,256 --> 00:13:28,025
Yeah, raise your hand
if she's the reason

241
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,260
that you fucking exploded in this life.

242
00:13:30,294 --> 00:13:32,164
I'm sorry for everything
that's happened.

243
00:13:32,189 --> 00:13:33,297
Yeah, speak for yourself.

244
00:13:33,322 --> 00:13:34,610
For everything that
you're going through.

245
00:13:34,635 --> 00:13:36,422
Mm, now you're just lying to her, Q.

246
00:13:36,447 --> 00:13:38,507
I'm sorry. I'm just having a hard time.

247
00:13:38,532 --> 00:13:42,203
- Yeah, because you blame her.
- I'm not blaming you for Alice.

248
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,844
If I'm being honest.

249
00:13:44,869 --> 00:13:46,946
No, if I make you feel
so shitty, just go.

250
00:13:46,971 --> 00:13:48,491
- No.
- Why?

251
00:13:48,516 --> 00:13:50,368
I'm the reason. If
I'm the reason, then...

252
00:13:50,393 --> 00:13:51,982
'Cause that doesn't feel right either.

253
00:13:52,014 --> 00:13:54,184
I don't know what's right.

254
00:13:55,518 --> 00:13:58,660
My best friend in the
world does crazy shit

255
00:13:58,685 --> 00:14:00,391
and doesn't trust me
and doesn't listen to me.

256
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:02,159
It is not that simple, and you know it.

257
00:14:02,191 --> 00:14:05,094
I don't... What am I supposed to do?

258
00:14:05,128 --> 00:14:08,031
You guys are both so goddamn maudlin.

259
00:14:20,444 --> 00:14:23,593
I promised you, in Fillory,

260
00:14:24,314 --> 00:14:27,318
when you told me about Reynard,
that I would help you somehow,

261
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,765
and that is not a promise

262
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,847
that I intend on breaking.

263
00:14:37,971 --> 00:14:40,240
So if there's anything that I can do...

264
00:14:40,265 --> 00:14:42,000
Actually, there is.

265
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:45,621
Help us rob a bank.

266
00:14:45,905 --> 00:14:47,700
Oh, my God, yes.

267
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:51,582
You say yes.

268
00:14:54,076 --> 00:14:55,546
It's for Professor Mayakovsky!

269
00:14:55,579 --> 00:14:58,582
It was destroyed by other books.

270
00:14:58,614 --> 00:15:00,316
"Future Movements of Magic"

271
00:15:00,349 --> 00:15:01,918
was written by a Polish scientist

272
00:15:01,951 --> 00:15:03,486
who happened to be a...

273
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,824
What?

274
00:15:04,849 --> 00:15:06,323
Jew.

275
00:15:06,355 --> 00:15:08,892
So the eugenics books came for it.

276
00:15:08,926 --> 00:15:10,194
I'm really sorry.

277
00:15:10,227 --> 00:15:11,904
They've been put in
the restricted section

278
00:15:11,929 --> 00:15:13,904
with the other anti-Semitic texts.

279
00:15:23,268 --> 00:15:24,706
Hey.

280
00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:29,307
I'm...

281
00:15:31,448 --> 00:15:33,279
Long story.

282
00:15:35,914 --> 00:15:37,748
Anyway...

283
00:16:31,192 --> 00:16:33,361
There's our little king.

284
00:16:34,926 --> 00:16:38,147
So how have you been since, um...

285
00:16:38,172 --> 00:16:40,675
Uh, I'm managing.

286
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,085
Um, how are things with you guys?

287
00:16:43,118 --> 00:16:46,146
Glad you asked. We're at war.

288
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:50,325
Also, Fillory is seriously,
dangerously stone-cold broke.

289
00:16:50,357 --> 00:16:52,126
Wait, how is that even possible?

290
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:53,961
The Nugget Beetles of the Outer Islands,

291
00:16:53,995 --> 00:16:55,496
they literally shit precious stones.

292
00:16:55,529 --> 00:16:57,265
Going extinct, apparently.

293
00:16:57,298 --> 00:17:00,001
Ember shitting in the
power grid really screwed us

294
00:17:00,034 --> 00:17:01,536
in a cornucopia of ways.

295
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:04,840
And before you ask, yes,
every alchemist in history

296
00:17:04,873 --> 00:17:07,757
is a lying, cheating illusionist.

297
00:17:07,782 --> 00:17:09,844
They turn lead into gold.
It turns right back in a day.

298
00:17:09,878 --> 00:17:12,281
So we are boned.

299
00:17:14,014 --> 00:17:16,886
How would you guys feel
about robbing a bank?

300
00:17:20,554 --> 00:17:22,175
Whew.

301
00:17:24,063 --> 00:17:25,582
So...

302
00:17:26,928 --> 00:17:28,824
what are you really up to?

303
00:17:34,963 --> 00:17:36,465
We need to rob a bank.

304
00:17:38,648 --> 00:17:41,585
A bank heist. Wow.

305
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:44,079
Hmm, I think the time
we've invested in him

306
00:17:44,111 --> 00:17:45,413
may actually pay off.

307
00:17:45,447 --> 00:17:46,548
Mm-hmm.

308
00:17:46,581 --> 00:17:49,492
Okay, first, there's
something I have to tell you.

309
00:17:49,517 --> 00:17:52,153
You're not gonna like
it, but hear me out.

310
00:17:52,187 --> 00:17:55,157
For Julia? The psychopath?

311
00:17:55,227 --> 00:17:57,746
The victim of a fucking rape

312
00:17:57,771 --> 00:18:00,357
by a trickster god.

313
00:18:02,264 --> 00:18:05,323
Look, I got to do this, okay? I owe her.

314
00:18:09,427 --> 00:18:10,562
So?

315
00:18:10,587 --> 00:18:14,446
You gonna ask the traveler you
just fucked the shit out of to help?

316
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,946
I mean, no, I didn't really
feel like I had the right.

317
00:18:17,978 --> 00:18:19,579
That's noble.

318
00:18:20,482 --> 00:18:22,142
But ask.

319
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:26,494
Not gonna lie, I always
wanted to rob a bank.

320
00:18:35,633 --> 00:18:38,803
To our little thievery corporation.

321
00:18:42,003 --> 00:18:43,675
PS, we still hate you.

322
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,139
But it's the 21st century.

323
00:18:45,172 --> 00:18:46,507
Shouldn't be this hard for a girl

324
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,342
to get an evil demigod abortion.

325
00:18:48,376 --> 00:18:49,831
And we're emotionally advanced.

326
00:18:49,856 --> 00:18:52,753
We can hold resentment and sympathy
for a person at the same time.

327
00:18:52,778 --> 00:18:54,600
And Fillory's broke. We need gold.

328
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:57,485
So lucky you.

329
00:18:57,518 --> 00:18:58,845
Thank you.

330
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,924
Okay, uh...

331
00:19:01,656 --> 00:19:03,959
so if this heist is happening,

332
00:19:03,992 --> 00:19:06,194
any ideas as to how?

333
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,246
Well, we cased the bank.

334
00:19:08,271 --> 00:19:10,904
There was a pretty gnarly
ward around the vault.

335
00:19:10,929 --> 00:19:13,365
Who here's actually robbed a bank?

336
00:19:15,035 --> 00:19:16,584
When was this?

337
00:19:16,609 --> 00:19:18,324
Senior year of high school.

338
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,442
I had some issues.

339
00:19:21,476 --> 00:19:23,879
Okay, listen up,

340
00:19:23,904 --> 00:19:26,714
'cause I'm only gonna go
through this shit once.

341
00:19:26,739 --> 00:19:28,382
Any bank worth robbing

342
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:31,291
uses one of a handful
of security systems.

343
00:19:31,316 --> 00:19:33,255
All the usual bells and whistles.

344
00:19:33,287 --> 00:19:35,377
But what most idiots don't know

345
00:19:35,402 --> 00:19:38,392
is, those companies are
all owned by Magicians.

346
00:19:38,426 --> 00:19:40,395
Wait, so the people that work there...

347
00:19:40,428 --> 00:19:43,570
Clueless. Tellers,
managers, security guards.

348
00:19:43,595 --> 00:19:44,742
They're all Muggles.

349
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,735
They have no idea the
vault has a secret feature.

350
00:19:47,768 --> 00:19:49,170
Serious wards.

351
00:19:49,204 --> 00:19:52,557
Designed specifically
to keep out Magicians.

352
00:19:53,241 --> 00:19:54,939
Now, in the case of our target,

353
00:19:54,964 --> 00:19:57,940
their fingerprints
control the alarm systems.

354
00:19:59,034 --> 00:20:00,415
It takes two managers

355
00:20:00,447 --> 00:20:03,003
scanning their prints simultaneously

356
00:20:03,028 --> 00:20:04,119
to do this.

357
00:20:04,151 --> 00:20:06,655
Once both the alarms
and the wards go down,

358
00:20:06,687 --> 00:20:09,291
you've got ten minutes
to get downstairs,

359
00:20:09,323 --> 00:20:10,829
past the armed guards,

360
00:20:10,854 --> 00:20:13,702
and enter in the
correct ten-digit combo.

361
00:20:13,727 --> 00:20:15,564
If you screw up the combination

362
00:20:15,597 --> 00:20:17,599
or you take longer than ten minutes,

363
00:20:17,631 --> 00:20:18,782
you're fucked.

364
00:20:18,807 --> 00:20:22,170
Now, basic bitches trip all
the standard alarm systems,

365
00:20:22,203 --> 00:20:23,572
but Magicians?

366
00:20:23,604 --> 00:20:27,775
We also trip the magic
wards, which means...

367
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,428
battle Magicians.

368
00:20:29,453 --> 00:20:33,256
Full-time security employees
on the DL, with benefits.

369
00:20:33,281 --> 00:20:35,283
You see one, run.

370
00:20:35,315 --> 00:20:38,120
They only ask questions post-mortem.

371
00:20:38,152 --> 00:20:40,187
But our ace is you.

372
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:43,257
Once we nab prints and drop the wards,

373
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:44,626
you travel straight in.

374
00:20:44,658 --> 00:20:47,028
You really don't think a
bank vault, of all places,

375
00:20:47,062 --> 00:20:48,697
has anti-traveler protection?

376
00:20:48,729 --> 00:20:50,064
Oh, they do.

377
00:20:50,098 --> 00:20:51,378
The entire floor of the vault

378
00:20:51,403 --> 00:20:53,468
is one big anti-traveling sigil.

379
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:56,338
You get locked in till
you run out of air.

380
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:59,474
Yeah. Pass. I like air.

381
00:20:59,506 --> 00:21:01,243
Relax, dummy.

382
00:21:01,275 --> 00:21:03,652
You only get stuck if you hit the floor.

383
00:21:03,677 --> 00:21:05,613
Oh, so it's like "Mission: Impossible."

384
00:21:05,647 --> 00:21:08,350
That movie was stupidly unrealistic.

385
00:21:08,382 --> 00:21:10,751
It's so much easier to just levitate.

386
00:21:10,784 --> 00:21:12,617
Yeah, I don't know how,

387
00:21:12,642 --> 00:21:14,375
and in case you guys have all forgotten,

388
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,689
I can't do magic.

389
00:21:15,723 --> 00:21:18,360
Oh, that's fine. This
is gonna get done to you.

390
00:21:18,392 --> 00:21:20,031
It's a little thingy

391
00:21:20,056 --> 00:21:21,763
any Physical Kid can
make in their sleep.

392
00:21:21,795 --> 00:21:23,564
Gravity belt. Exactly.

393
00:21:23,598 --> 00:21:26,835
Once we drop the wards, float Penny,

394
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:31,115
he zips in, he zips out... payday.

395
00:21:32,578 --> 00:21:34,142
Julia, run!

396
00:21:34,232 --> 00:21:35,968
It's there. You just don't see it. Go!

397
00:21:35,993 --> 00:21:37,812
- I thought it was dead.
- I guess it's got friends.

398
00:21:37,845 --> 00:21:39,647
- Kady, come on.
- No, you go. I'll catch up.

399
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,208
- Kady!
- No! I need to kill it.

400
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:42,427
- I'll be fine.
- Why?

401
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,685
- I need its spoon.
- Spoon?

402
00:21:58,756 --> 00:22:00,334
This is yours, isn't it?

403
00:22:00,366 --> 00:22:02,753
You sent those things
after Julia, didn't you?

404
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,944
See, this is what happen
when you don't pay.

405
00:22:08,969 --> 00:22:10,108
Jehn-jang.

406
00:22:10,133 --> 00:22:12,680
- Lady, use your words.
- Dak-chuh!

407
00:22:12,712 --> 00:22:14,468
This is for dokkaebi.

408
00:22:14,615 --> 00:22:16,584
How you say... goblin.

409
00:22:16,616 --> 00:22:17,784
Invisible, right?

410
00:22:17,818 --> 00:22:19,382
- Yeah.
- Right.

411
00:22:19,407 --> 00:22:20,942
This is very old magic.

412
00:22:20,967 --> 00:22:23,303
You bring to life using
old, abandoned things,

413
00:22:23,328 --> 00:22:25,330
like this wooden spoon...

414
00:22:25,526 --> 00:22:26,983
and menstrual blood.

415
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,780
Probably Moon's.

416
00:22:30,561 --> 00:22:32,132
These creatures are mercenaries.

417
00:22:32,165 --> 00:22:33,433
They won't stop.

418
00:22:33,466 --> 00:22:36,803
You kill one, another
one grows in its place.

419
00:22:36,837 --> 00:22:38,204
Very fucked up.

420
00:22:38,238 --> 00:22:39,774
Why the hell would she do that?

421
00:22:39,807 --> 00:22:41,174
To kill your friend.

422
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:42,810
I told Moon to relax,

423
00:22:42,843 --> 00:22:44,311
but she's all, "Baby's too evil.

424
00:22:44,344 --> 00:22:46,334
"It might hurt more people."

425
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:47,660
She wants to play it safe

426
00:22:47,685 --> 00:22:49,687
and kill both spawn and mom together.

427
00:22:49,782 --> 00:22:51,284
She's so stupid.

428
00:22:51,318 --> 00:22:53,520
You won't pay if your friend is dead.

429
00:22:53,553 --> 00:22:56,167
Listen, we are trying to
get you the money, okay?

430
00:22:56,192 --> 00:22:58,233
If you want to get paid so fucking bad,

431
00:22:58,258 --> 00:22:59,693
tell her to call it off.

432
00:22:59,725 --> 00:23:02,525
Can't. She has a hundred spoons.

433
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:05,465
Dokkaebi will not stop
until trickster baby is dead,

434
00:23:05,499 --> 00:23:07,268
so you got two options.

435
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,302
I can exorcise for you,

436
00:23:09,336 --> 00:23:12,023
or monster rips your
friend's head off her neck.

437
00:23:12,048 --> 00:23:14,076
So hurry up with my gold.

438
00:23:26,787 --> 00:23:28,359
Hey.

439
00:23:29,458 --> 00:23:30,860
What's that?

440
00:23:30,885 --> 00:23:32,119
You remember that one time

441
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:34,136
Richard and the Free
Traders rewound time?

442
00:23:34,161 --> 00:23:36,163
- Déjà pizza?
- Yeah.

443
00:23:36,195 --> 00:23:38,245
I think this is how they did it.

444
00:23:39,566 --> 00:23:41,669
That was heavy cooperative magic.

445
00:23:41,694 --> 00:23:44,597
Yeah, well, there are
notes for version 2.0 here.

446
00:23:44,637 --> 00:23:47,241
I mean, it's more
efficient. Takes less juice.

447
00:23:47,273 --> 00:23:49,175
Either one of us could run it.

448
00:23:49,209 --> 00:23:50,873
Let's see.

449
00:23:55,249 --> 00:23:57,151
"The Quarterback"?

450
00:23:57,183 --> 00:23:58,853
Goes back 15 seconds.

451
00:23:58,885 --> 00:24:01,495
Get it? Quarter of a minute?

452
00:24:02,222 --> 00:24:04,878
Yeah, Richard did like his dad jokes.

453
00:24:06,108 --> 00:24:08,470
Anyway, I thought it could be useful,

454
00:24:08,495 --> 00:24:10,231
but at this rate,

455
00:24:10,263 --> 00:24:12,332
I won't actually get
it to work for weeks.

456
00:24:12,366 --> 00:24:14,367
And I guess I'd be weighed
down lugging it anyway.

457
00:24:14,401 --> 00:24:17,337
It's got a pretty small
radius of influence.

458
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:19,961
Julia, you can't come.

459
00:24:20,641 --> 00:24:22,125
What?

460
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:24,278
Those invisible blood-goblin things,

461
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,803
they won't stop coming.

462
00:24:25,828 --> 00:24:28,616
I mean, not until your problem's dead,

463
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:32,039
meaning you are.

464
00:24:32,064 --> 00:24:34,221
If you step out from
under these wards...

465
00:24:34,253 --> 00:24:36,395
It'll find me and all of you.

466
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:40,227
So I'm supposed to, what, just
wait here, fingers crossed,

467
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,229
while everyone who blames
me for Alice's death

468
00:24:42,261 --> 00:24:43,364
risks their life?

469
00:24:43,396 --> 00:24:45,028
I mean, how does that even make sense?

470
00:24:45,053 --> 00:24:47,924
Just 'cause you can't come
doesn't mean you can't be there.

471
00:24:49,802 --> 00:24:52,639
You can listen in and watch.

472
00:24:56,755 --> 00:24:58,212
All right, but if anything goes wrong...

473
00:24:58,244 --> 00:25:00,458
Nothing will. Okay?

474
00:25:11,926 --> 00:25:15,215
Librarian, Neck Beard,
and White Privilege.

475
00:25:15,395 --> 00:25:18,598
They're the managers. We
need two of their prints.

476
00:25:18,632 --> 00:25:22,910
The good news is, they all go
to the same lame bar after work.

477
00:25:23,537 --> 00:25:27,020
I'll take White Privilege.
Kady, you take Neck Beard.

478
00:25:27,426 --> 00:25:30,543
Oh, nut up. It's just a finger.

479
00:25:30,577 --> 00:25:34,347
Walk up to him, grab his hand,
and say, "Can I borrow this?"

480
00:25:34,381 --> 00:25:36,222
Dip his stupid finger in his drink

481
00:25:36,247 --> 00:25:38,356
to sanitize it, and...

482
00:25:39,453 --> 00:25:42,522
pop it in your mouth, walk away,

483
00:25:42,556 --> 00:25:45,473
yet stay emblazoned on
his heart for a lifetime.

484
00:25:45,498 --> 00:25:47,457
Done and done.

485
00:25:48,363 --> 00:25:49,370
Fine.

486
00:25:49,395 --> 00:25:50,590
Why does it got to be Kady?

487
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:52,399
It could be Penny or Eliot.

488
00:25:52,432 --> 00:25:54,113
- Or you.
- Yeah.

489
00:25:54,449 --> 00:25:56,302
Sounded like volunteering.

490
00:25:56,336 --> 00:25:58,729
- Okay, fine, I'll take the librarian.
- Ha-ha.

491
00:25:58,754 --> 00:26:00,841
Great. Quentin will go in my place.

492
00:26:00,874 --> 00:26:02,502
Thanks, Q.

493
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:17,402
So he really just stuck
that in your mouth?

494
00:26:17,427 --> 00:26:18,640
Yup.

495
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,770
That is how the spell works.

496
00:26:21,795 --> 00:26:23,507
Damn.

497
00:26:26,399 --> 00:26:29,936
Unexpectedly, I'm somehow
turned on right now.

498
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:31,833
Oh, really?

499
00:26:32,372 --> 00:26:34,451
- Look at this idiot.
- Ugh.

500
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:36,967
Took you long enough.

501
00:26:38,236 --> 00:26:40,239
So show us the goods.

502
00:26:43,317 --> 00:26:44,617
Oh, God.

503
00:26:44,651 --> 00:26:46,487
Oh, that's bad.

504
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,722
How'd you get it in your mouth?

505
00:26:50,356 --> 00:26:52,847
Oh, it wasn't with your mouth, was it?

506
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,145
- Wh...
- Oh!

507
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:56,589
- Oh, shit!
- Mm-mm.

508
00:26:56,962 --> 00:26:59,199
She went Digital Underground?

509
00:26:59,224 --> 00:27:01,394
- Oh, God.
- Whoo!

510
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,221
What else do we have to do?

511
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,837
With these, we're golden.

512
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:08,075
Margo and Eliot grabbed everything
else we need for the morning.

513
00:27:08,107 --> 00:27:10,443
So go rest up, Goldwater.

514
00:27:10,506 --> 00:27:12,238
You've earned it.

515
00:27:21,087 --> 00:27:22,423
All right.

516
00:27:22,455 --> 00:27:24,824
Stick to the plan precisely,

517
00:27:24,857 --> 00:27:26,626
and we should be golden.

518
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,928
I'll be right here waiting,

519
00:27:27,961 --> 00:27:29,063
engines running.

520
00:27:29,096 --> 00:27:30,564
Of course you will.

521
00:27:30,597 --> 00:27:31,964
The brains of the operation

522
00:27:31,998 --> 00:27:33,465
drives the getaway.

523
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:35,957
- Everyone knows that.
- Of course.

524
00:27:36,703 --> 00:27:40,105
Okay, bitches. Let's do this.

525
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:54,626
- Thanks, Jimmy.
- Yeah.

526
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:15,281
Ah!

527
00:28:35,137 --> 00:28:36,420
Good luck.

528
00:29:19,465 --> 00:29:22,101
All right. Let's set the clocks.

529
00:29:28,282 --> 00:29:29,494
Okay.

530
00:29:31,045 --> 00:29:33,048
Three, two, one.

531
00:29:36,382 --> 00:29:39,186
Okay. Alarms and wards are down.

532
00:29:39,218 --> 00:29:41,688
It's up to Penny now.

533
00:29:42,956 --> 00:29:44,324
Let's go.

534
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:56,637
Wait. Oh, shit. Um...

535
00:30:02,499 --> 00:30:03,876
Ha-ha.

536
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:12,122
Oh, shit.

537
00:30:29,225 --> 00:30:30,434
Shit!

538
00:31:08,175 --> 00:31:10,179
God damn it.

539
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,601
Fuck.

540
00:31:13,063 --> 00:31:14,932
Fucking Physical Kids.

541
00:31:17,207 --> 00:31:19,793
Penny's only got one
minute. Where the hell is he?

542
00:31:20,786 --> 00:31:22,941
Cutting it a little
close, don't you think?

543
00:31:23,004 --> 00:31:24,323
So where's the booty?

544
00:31:24,357 --> 00:31:25,759
Eliot, who are you talking to?

545
00:31:25,792 --> 00:31:27,668
They can't see me. I'm
not technically here.

546
00:31:27,693 --> 00:31:29,062
I'm incepting your ass!

547
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:31,131
Your head. Your dreams.

548
00:31:31,164 --> 00:31:33,233
You're still asleep
in Fillory, remember?

549
00:31:33,265 --> 00:31:35,034
That is overly complicated.

550
00:31:35,068 --> 00:31:37,533
You know what's not?
The sigil I just touched

551
00:31:37,558 --> 00:31:39,706
'cause someone messed
up the buoyancy math.

552
00:31:39,738 --> 00:31:41,341
Oh, that is not good.

553
00:31:41,373 --> 00:31:42,924
Eliot, what's going on?

554
00:31:42,949 --> 00:31:45,079
How do I put this? Penny fucked up.

555
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:47,346
No, it's your stupid
device. I'm stuck now.

556
00:31:47,379 --> 00:31:49,215
Penny's incepting my... never mind.

557
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:51,451
Just trust me, we have to
get him out of that vault now.

558
00:31:52,609 --> 00:31:55,329
Or, say, sometime in
the previous ten minutes.

559
00:31:55,354 --> 00:31:58,191
Fuck. Shit.

560
00:31:58,225 --> 00:31:59,927
Shit, let's go!

561
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:02,129
Tell her I'm fine. I'm
just... I'm running out of air.

562
00:32:02,161 --> 00:32:03,598
Well, way to mix the message.

563
00:32:07,533 --> 00:32:09,335
Hey, Margo, keep the engine running.

564
00:32:09,369 --> 00:32:10,471
I'll inform the bank manager

565
00:32:10,504 --> 00:32:12,551
the bees are resisting extermination

566
00:32:12,576 --> 00:32:14,440
and everyone needs to
stay clear a little longer.

567
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,909
Let's go, kids. We're going back in.

568
00:32:31,257 --> 00:32:33,243
- Shh. Quiet.
- Stop it.

569
00:32:34,025 --> 00:32:35,593
You...

570
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,743
- you are bad.
- No, you're bad.

571
00:32:44,376 --> 00:32:46,005
- Oh, shit.
- What?

572
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:48,329
- Guards.
- What? I thought they evacuated.

573
00:32:48,354 --> 00:32:50,790
I got this. I brought
the perfect weapon.

574
00:32:50,815 --> 00:32:52,050
Wait, you're not gonna...

575
00:32:52,075 --> 00:32:53,988
Kill them? God, no.

576
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:57,087
The Wrecking Ball is a weapon of peace.

577
00:32:57,317 --> 00:32:59,987
Trust me. I'm a genius.

578
00:33:01,554 --> 00:33:03,289
Read the book, and then
you watch the movie,

579
00:33:03,322 --> 00:33:04,524
and it's always just whiny.

580
00:33:06,426 --> 00:33:08,387
I'm totally disappointed in the book.

581
00:33:08,412 --> 00:33:09,737
Mind if I read you?

582
00:33:09,762 --> 00:33:11,161
Stop it.

583
00:33:11,186 --> 00:33:12,287
Stop it!

00:33:52,973 --> 00:33:55,943
at our cottage soirees,
but it came on a bit strong.

595
00:33:55,975 --> 00:33:57,277
Shit.

596
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:05,749
There's no way we can pick this lock.

597
00:34:05,774 --> 00:34:07,321
Maybe we can brute-force it.

598
00:34:07,353 --> 00:34:11,324
Hold on. I think this door
is too thick, even for you.

599
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:12,683
Okay, just so we're
all on the same page,

600
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:14,308
we've got less than four minutes.

601
00:34:15,395 --> 00:34:18,159
Penny! We're getting you out!

602
00:34:18,279 --> 00:34:20,815
I don't even think Alice could
do this in under four minutes.

603
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,143
Maybe not then, but
now I could do it in 15.

604
00:34:23,168 --> 00:34:24,471
Seconds.

605
00:34:24,504 --> 00:34:26,526
Oh, well. Rest in peace, Penny.

606
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,956
Well, I guess I could help.

607
00:34:29,981 --> 00:34:31,487
For a price.

608
00:34:32,471 --> 00:34:33,911
I want to drive.

609
00:34:33,936 --> 00:34:36,123
For an hour a day, I
get control of your body.

610
00:34:36,148 --> 00:34:39,152
Okay, okay. Maybe we break
this up. We split up the work.

611
00:34:39,185 --> 00:34:40,520
I don't even know where to start.

612
00:34:40,552 --> 00:34:42,089
Well, we can't just stand here!

613
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,257
I wouldn't hurt anyone.

614
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:46,025
I just want to stretch the tiniest bit.

615
00:34:46,058 --> 00:34:47,263
Breathe.

616
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:49,560
You set the terms. We could
even do a "word as bond"

617
00:34:49,585 --> 00:34:51,263
so that I can't break it.

618
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:55,828
Okay. 30 minutes. That's all you get.

619
00:34:55,853 --> 00:34:58,529
After we hash out the "word as bond."

620
00:34:59,053 --> 00:35:00,239
Great.

621
00:35:00,272 --> 00:35:01,607
You try anything crazy...

622
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,310
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Box.

623
00:35:03,342 --> 00:35:04,578
Is it a deal?

624
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:05,978
Fine, it's a deal.

625
00:35:06,011 --> 00:35:07,546
Are you talking to yourself?

626
00:35:08,236 --> 00:35:10,852
No. Yes. Uh...

627
00:35:12,102 --> 00:35:14,953
Yes. I'm just... I'm doing
long division in my head.

628
00:35:14,978 --> 00:35:16,899
Move. Move.

629
00:35:47,721 --> 00:35:50,090
I've always been good at math.

630
00:35:51,391 --> 00:35:54,061
- Hi. You okay?
- Oh, shit. Yeah, I'm okay.

631
00:35:54,094 --> 00:35:55,228
- Okay.
- All right.

632
00:35:55,261 --> 00:35:56,743
Princess rescued.

633
00:35:56,768 --> 00:35:59,170
Let's collect our reward and go.

634
00:36:05,605 --> 00:36:07,373
Yes!

635
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,079
Oh, shit.

636
00:36:13,318 --> 00:36:15,287
Q, stop! Oh!

637
00:36:15,312 --> 00:36:16,549
Shit! Oh, no.

638
00:36:51,317 --> 00:36:52,987
- Let's go!
- Come on.

639
00:36:53,869 --> 00:36:55,138
Okay.

640
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:57,057
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

641
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:59,125
Go back! Go back! Go back!

642
00:37:06,876 --> 00:37:08,594
Shit.

643
00:37:10,402 --> 00:37:13,306
Oh, shit, shit, shit!

644
00:37:19,569 --> 00:37:21,121
Well, why should I go out there first?

645
00:37:21,146 --> 00:37:22,762
You're the battle Magician.

646
00:37:22,787 --> 00:37:24,496
What about another Wrecking Ball?

647
00:37:24,521 --> 00:37:26,288
It was a one-off.

648
00:37:30,431 --> 00:37:32,166
Oh, shit.

649
00:37:35,017 --> 00:37:37,754
You're the... the battle Magician.

650
00:37:37,779 --> 00:37:40,172
- Wait, did we just...
- Go back in time?

651
00:37:40,197 --> 00:37:42,204
Yeah. Julia?

652
00:37:42,238 --> 00:37:44,328
I'm outside. I can see
you in the van's mirror.

653
00:37:44,353 --> 00:37:46,492
The effect reaches far enough?

654
00:37:46,995 --> 00:37:48,820
Listen, you only have four rewinds.

655
00:37:48,845 --> 00:37:49,984
Julia's outside.

656
00:37:50,009 --> 00:37:52,411
She's watching with a
machine that can rewind time.

657
00:38:02,127 --> 00:38:03,629
Let's go!

658
00:38:08,004 --> 00:38:09,072
You're the...

659
00:38:09,097 --> 00:38:10,967
Kady, three rewinds left.

660
00:38:10,992 --> 00:38:12,590
She can only go back 15 seconds.

661
00:38:12,615 --> 00:38:13,762
Let's go!

662
00:38:21,392 --> 00:38:23,888
- You're the...
- Two rewinds left.

663
00:38:32,467 --> 00:38:33,739
Penny!

664
00:38:34,419 --> 00:38:35,892
Kady, last rewind.

665
00:38:35,924 --> 00:38:37,356
Okay, look. We need a plan.

666
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:39,769
Okay. Okay, I'll blast the bitch.

667
00:38:39,794 --> 00:38:41,325
You all run left. She's
always on the right.

668
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:43,477
Is she? 'Cause the last time, I
thought she was more in the middle.

669
00:38:43,502 --> 00:38:45,304
15 seconds!

670
00:38:56,203 --> 00:38:57,338
Let's go.

671
00:39:04,343 --> 00:39:05,823
Kady!

672
00:39:09,011 --> 00:39:10,385
Julia.

673
00:39:11,227 --> 00:39:12,796
Julia, answer me.

674
00:39:13,837 --> 00:39:15,972
Shit. Let's go.

675
00:39:16,739 --> 00:39:18,206
Q, come on. Grab the bar.

676
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:20,792
- But...
- Grab the bar! Let's go!

677
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:22,267
- What about...
- It's clay.

678
00:39:22,292 --> 00:39:23,996
Eliot's fine. Let's go!

679
00:39:25,693 --> 00:39:27,043
Eliot?

680
00:39:27,177 --> 00:39:29,769
Eliot! Eliot!

681
00:39:30,371 --> 00:39:31,714
Guards!

682
00:39:49,223 --> 00:39:50,892
Julia. Are you okay?

683
00:39:50,917 --> 00:39:52,986
Jules. Julia?

684
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:55,025
- Talk to me.
- Julia, stay with us.

685
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:56,270
Talk to me. Are you all right?

686
00:39:56,295 --> 00:39:57,463
It's gonna be fine.
We're gonna get help.

687
00:39:57,496 --> 00:39:58,965
- It's gonna be okay.
- Julia.

688
00:39:58,998 --> 00:40:00,466
- Julia.
- Come on. Hey.

689
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,636
- Julia.
- Jules, stay with us. Come on.

690
00:40:02,668 --> 00:40:04,204
Julia?

691
00:40:13,195 --> 00:40:14,530
Hey.

692
00:40:17,306 --> 00:40:19,620
No, don't move around too much.

693
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,862
Sun patched you up, but
it's gonna take a while.

694
00:40:25,003 --> 00:40:26,920
Did she do it?

695
00:40:27,651 --> 00:40:30,065
Did it work? Is it gone?

696
00:40:30,601 --> 00:40:32,337
Yeah.

697
00:40:32,362 --> 00:40:34,190
She did it.

698
00:40:34,969 --> 00:40:37,060
But, Julia...

699
00:40:38,778 --> 00:40:40,825
there was a complication.
