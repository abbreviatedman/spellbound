1
00:00:01,008 --> 00:00:02,891
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:04,579 --> 00:00:06,515
They know everything...

3
00:00:06,547 --> 00:00:08,817
who you are, what you have done.

4
00:00:08,851 --> 00:00:10,185
You cannot go back.

5
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:11,653
What am I supposed to do?

6
00:00:11,686 --> 00:00:13,054
What we all do.

7
00:00:13,088 --> 00:00:14,824
Decide.

8
00:00:14,961 --> 00:00:16,234
_

9
00:00:16,336 --> 00:00:18,593
- Hey, where's Kady?
- Who gives a shit?

10
00:00:18,626 --> 00:00:21,062
I don't think Penny even
cares that she's gone.

11
00:00:21,095 --> 00:00:24,375
Believe me, he does.

12
00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:26,508
We're gonna make another you.

13
00:00:26,533 --> 00:00:29,038
You sleep here, your
mind goes into the golem.

14
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:36,586
The test was positive.

15
00:00:36,611 --> 00:00:37,745
I want an abortion.

16
00:00:37,778 --> 00:00:39,748
It's a totally mundane procedure.

17
00:00:39,781 --> 00:00:41,004
Is it?

18
00:00:41,029 --> 00:00:44,120
'Cause it might not be a simple,
totally mundane human embryo.

19
00:00:44,145 --> 00:00:46,154
Stop. What are you doing? Stop! Kady!

20
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:49,954
So sorry about this.

21
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,628
That's my Haxenpaxen!

22
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,313
Just imagine what it's
giving off magically.

23
00:00:55,338 --> 00:00:57,735
We're invisible while we're near him.

24
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,103
- Kady!
- Your magic is no good here.

25
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,781
What's with Stink-master Flash?

26
00:01:05,843 --> 00:01:08,042
- He's coming with us.
- It's my mom's contact.

27
00:01:08,075 --> 00:01:10,044
She could help with the baby situation.

28
00:01:10,078 --> 00:01:12,114
They may be able to help
your friend with her problem,

29
00:01:12,146 --> 00:01:15,059
but listen, I would never,
ever do business with them

30
00:01:15,084 --> 00:01:16,216
if I had a choice.

31
00:01:16,241 --> 00:01:18,887
Your majesties, the
much-venerated Emissaries

32
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,622
of our neighbors to the north.

33
00:01:20,655 --> 00:01:24,217
I present Prince Ess of Loria.

34
00:01:26,161 --> 00:01:29,031
- You fucked with us.
- Mm-hmm. Yes, you did.

35
00:01:29,063 --> 00:01:31,566
- You fucked with our castle.
- Amen, sister.

36
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:33,792
And now the High King and I

37
00:01:33,817 --> 00:01:37,472
hereby declare war on
the kingdom of Loria.

38
00:01:37,497 --> 00:01:38,769
Yes!

39
00:01:38,794 --> 00:01:41,109
Wait, really?

40
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:43,546
I cast the niffin summoning,
and you didn't come.

41
00:01:43,578 --> 00:01:46,281
You're wrong. I was right there.

42
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:48,580
I killed you. My cacodemon...

43
00:01:48,605 --> 00:01:51,378
Your cacodemon wasn't
powerful enough to kill me.

44
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:52,772
It tried.

45
00:01:52,805 --> 00:01:54,307
But when it saw that it couldn't win,

46
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,775
well, let's just say it

47
00:01:55,808 --> 00:01:58,244
stuffed me in a place most convenient...

48
00:01:58,278 --> 00:02:01,014
that stupid tattoo trap on your back.

49
00:02:01,046 --> 00:02:02,884
We're stuck with each other.

50
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:04,195
Oh, Quentin.

51
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,353
We're gonna have so much fun.

52
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,598
Stop ignoring me! Stop
ignoring me, you pussy!

53
00:02:26,698 --> 00:02:28,573
Pay attention to me,
you miserable sad sack!

54
00:02:28,574 --> 00:02:30,886
- What's wrong with you?
- Stop it!

55
00:02:33,718 --> 00:02:36,089
Are you ready to let me out
of that hairy back of yours?

56
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:37,398
'Cause I'm never gonna stop.

57
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:39,126
And sooner or later,
one of these dummies

58
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,913
are gonna call the brain
police, and you got priors.

59
00:02:43,034 --> 00:02:44,937
This is not Alice. This is not Alice.

60
00:02:44,962 --> 00:02:47,064
This is not Alice. This is not Alice.

61
00:02:47,089 --> 00:02:49,392
Just keep telling yourself that.

62
00:02:49,537 --> 00:02:51,239
You have got to stop.

63
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:54,309
Fine. Let me out of
this trap, and I'm gone.

64
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:57,041
Okay, look, Alice...

65
00:02:57,345 --> 00:03:00,533
Evil Thing Inside of Me
That Used to Be Alice...

66
00:03:00,658 --> 00:03:03,695
I have to say the
words to open the trap.

67
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:05,887
Of my own volition. Out loud.

68
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,221
And I'm not going to do that

69
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,357
because there is one
policy for you out here,

70
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:11,059
and it is to box you up for eternity.

71
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:13,831
I'm kind of boxed up right now, in you.

72
00:03:13,856 --> 00:03:16,995
It's not the same
thing, and you know it.

73
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:20,370
Block of wood isn't
trying to fix this. I am.

74
00:03:20,395 --> 00:03:23,866
Save me? Is that what
you think you're doing?

75
00:03:23,891 --> 00:03:25,273
You think I want that?

76
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,907
I think if you were
really you right now,

77
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:28,209
that's all you would want.

78
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,610
Oh, what, and you're the world's

79
00:03:29,644 --> 00:03:31,012
foremost expert on all things me?

80
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,145
Based on what?

81
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:33,914
Our garbage fire of a relationship

82
00:03:33,948 --> 00:03:35,650
that ended with Eliot's
dick in your mouth?

83
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,084
Look, you came really close

84
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:38,353
to fixing this once for your brother.

85
00:03:38,386 --> 00:03:39,651
I thought I did.

86
00:03:39,676 --> 00:03:41,089
But I was like you then.

87
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:42,923
Small yet weirdly arrogant

88
00:03:42,965 --> 00:03:45,035
for somebody who didn't
understand magic at all.

89
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,096
If you would just work with
me instead of jabbing at me,

90
00:03:48,128 --> 00:03:49,530
we could figure out what's missing.

91
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,964
We could make the spell work.

92
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:52,299
We could do this.

93
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:53,501
Listen to me.

94
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:57,875
I promise, the math
will never add up, Q.

95
00:03:58,106 --> 00:04:00,508
You'll never get that girl back.

96
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:04,645
Everything that's missing
burnt up when I became this.

97
00:04:04,679 --> 00:04:07,414
It's gone forever, Q.

98
00:04:07,448 --> 00:04:09,450
This isn't good for either of us.

99
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:13,154
No, no, this is making
me saner by the second.

100
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,388
I don't want to hurt you.

101
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:16,157
I actually don't want to hurt anyone.

102
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,373
Bullshit, you're a niffin.

103
00:04:17,398 --> 00:04:18,809
Q, I'm not bloodthirsty.

104
00:04:18,834 --> 00:04:20,395
I just want to be free.

105
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,497
And I already told you I can't do that.

106
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,743
Fine. Just let me take over your body

107
00:04:25,768 --> 00:04:27,434
for just the tiniest little bit.

108
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,681
I'll be good. I'll be so good.

109
00:04:29,797 --> 00:04:31,751
No, that's crazy.

110
00:04:31,776 --> 00:04:34,727
So I have to be a niffin, yet
I don't even get to be a niffin?

111
00:04:34,752 --> 00:04:36,181
I could travel the universe.

112
00:04:36,206 --> 00:04:37,540
I could see things you
couldn't even imagine,

113
00:04:37,565 --> 00:04:40,615
but instead, I have to be
bored and stuck with you!

114
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:43,184
I'm sorry that it is torture
to be with the one person

115
00:04:43,217 --> 00:04:44,551
who is trying to help you.

116
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:48,022
So go back to screaming
until you go insane?

117
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,090
- Is that your choice?
- No.

118
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,842
That's your choice.

119
00:04:51,867 --> 00:04:54,124
Or you could be quiet.

120
00:05:00,365 --> 00:05:03,274
And you can let me try and solve this.

121
00:05:17,875 --> 00:05:20,211
Well, this is the place.

122
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:23,307
Of course it is. Why wouldn't it be?

123
00:05:23,332 --> 00:05:25,947
I mean, Goldie said they're legit.

124
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:29,542
Only one way to find out.

125
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:10,128
- Problem?
- No problem.

126
00:06:10,153 --> 00:06:13,273
We're just discussing how
to handle your situation.

127
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,909
That's okay. My way is best way.

128
00:06:16,243 --> 00:06:18,246
But you can abort it, right?

129
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:20,447
This is exorcism.

130
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:22,417
That thing is not human.

131
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:24,085
The longer it's inside you,

132
00:06:24,118 --> 00:06:25,787
the more tangled it
gets with your essence

133
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,522
and the harder it is for me to help you,

134
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,197
you understand?

135
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,543
Okay.

136
00:06:31,568 --> 00:06:33,635
Then I exorcise the trickster for you.

137
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,768
After you pay. Thank you.

138
00:06:43,485 --> 00:06:45,122
$1 million?

139
00:06:45,147 --> 00:06:46,840
In gold.

140
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:49,309
Paper money is for
drug dealers and idiots.

141
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:50,677
Look, Goldie will tell
you I'm good for it.

142
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,513
Can you just do it now
and we'll pay you later?

143
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:54,816
Bars. Two big bars.

144
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:56,440
Maybe 60 pounds.

145
00:06:56,465 --> 00:06:57,773
That's all.

146
00:07:01,821 --> 00:07:03,723
What?

147
00:07:03,926 --> 00:07:05,560
No, I'm just... I'm trying to remember

148
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,294
the last time not having enough money

149
00:07:07,328 --> 00:07:08,996
was one of my biggest problems.

150
00:07:09,021 --> 00:07:12,038
Okay, well, cash won't cut it, so, what,

151
00:07:12,225 --> 00:07:13,667
pawnshops?

152
00:07:13,835 --> 00:07:17,104
A million dollars in
chains and earrings?

153
00:07:17,138 --> 00:07:19,944
I mean, that would
take so many pawnshops.

154
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,374
We might as well rob a bank.

155
00:07:23,957 --> 00:07:26,093
Well, we are Magicians.

156
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:29,651
Why don't we just rob a bank?

157
00:07:37,049 --> 00:07:40,712
<font color="#007700">Synced and corrected by Aaronnmb</font>
www.addic7ed.com

158
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:46,055
So there's really no way to just...

159
00:07:47,032 --> 00:07:49,203
take it all back?

160
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:52,340
Your Majesty, one
cannot simply take back

161
00:07:52,365 --> 00:07:54,430
- a declaration of war.
- Good.

162
00:07:54,455 --> 00:07:56,329
Because I don't.

163
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:59,212
There are Lorian troops
marching to the border.

164
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:00,448
They're days away.

165
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:02,650
We believe they intend
to penetrate Fillory

166
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:04,619
by way of the Grudge Gap.

167
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:06,787
And, of course, our
preparation is affected

168
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,758
by the continued...
unsteadiness of the Wellspring.

169
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,924
Okay, well, we've got
literally every engineer

170
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:15,929
in the kingdom working to
de-shit-inate the Wellspring.

171
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,665
Gonna invent the
guillotine in a hot second

172
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,304
if they don't get their shit together.

173
00:08:20,329 --> 00:08:22,064
Everyone is doing their best, my queen.

174
00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:25,481
We expect to clear said water shortly.

175
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:27,515
We're excessively optimistic.

176
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,918
Spare no expense.

177
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:30,578
Which brings me to my point.

178
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:33,508
Fixing the Wellspring is expensive.

179
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:35,248
War is expensive.

180
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:38,617
And at this time, we do not
have the funds necessary...

181
00:08:38,642 --> 00:08:40,110
We're broke?

182
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,663
It's magic residue.

183
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:59,339
Probably from a ward around
the bank's underground vault.

184
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,217
It's a regular bank.

185
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:04,211
Regular banks have magical wards?

186
00:09:04,245 --> 00:09:07,045
Ones connected to the
Federal Reserve do, yeah.

187
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:09,904
Okay, so how do we get past it?

188
00:09:12,414 --> 00:09:15,050
- Shit, it's...
- The Haxenpaxen.

189
00:09:20,995 --> 00:09:22,964
Hey, we can't just let it out.

190
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:24,698
If...

191
00:09:58,337 --> 00:09:59,733
What the fuck?

192
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:07,274
Oh, my God. What the hell? A spoon?

193
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:09,810
I think it's dead.

194
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:12,507
What the hell was it
besides huge and invisible?

195
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,883
Fuck. We have to stop the bleeding.

196
00:10:27,254 --> 00:10:28,974
We should bury it properly.

197
00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:31,631
Okay, but, Jules, we got to move, okay?

198
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:34,035
We really need to get somewhere safe.

199
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:35,952
Okay, like?

200
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,358
You're not gonna like it.

201
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:56,809
Have you seen the "Twilight" movies?

202
00:10:56,843 --> 00:10:58,947
Specifically the last one?

203
00:10:59,411 --> 00:11:00,479
No.

204
00:11:00,512 --> 00:11:03,361
Huh. That's probably for the best.

205
00:11:04,349 --> 00:11:07,886
Your problems extend beyond your uterus.

206
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,352
The fetus' élan vital is...

207
00:11:11,377 --> 00:11:14,492
entangled with your soul.

208
00:11:14,794 --> 00:11:16,029
I mean, I have read about this,

209
00:11:16,061 --> 00:11:18,297
but I've... I've never
seen it in person.

210
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:20,032
You will need to find a Mudang.

211
00:11:20,065 --> 00:11:21,834
It's their area.

212
00:11:21,867 --> 00:11:24,903
Yeah, we did. She was expensive.

213
00:11:24,936 --> 00:11:26,472
Yeah, tell me about it.

214
00:11:26,506 --> 00:11:29,189
I've been trying to get
one on staff for years.

215
00:11:40,239 --> 00:11:42,479
That poor girl is fucked.

216
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,288
And you are suggesting?

217
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,727
Let her stay.

218
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,329
I know that you expelled Kady

219
00:11:49,362 --> 00:11:51,765
and that you are not generally
keen on granting asylum,

220
00:11:51,798 --> 00:11:53,333
especially to hedges.

221
00:11:53,373 --> 00:11:57,878
Yes, well, this is a special case.

222
00:11:57,904 --> 00:12:00,458
Julia and I have a past.

223
00:12:00,806 --> 00:12:04,343
Handle it however you
want, but for the record,

224
00:12:04,377 --> 00:12:06,680
that girl will be safer at Brakebills.

225
00:12:06,713 --> 00:12:08,361
Mm.

226
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,853
"How to transfer the
energy from one being

227
00:12:18,878 --> 00:12:22,216
"and transform it."

228
00:12:38,535 --> 00:12:41,406
Hey, what... what are
you two doing here?

229
00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:45,735
What?

230
00:12:54,349 --> 00:12:56,826
What's this bitch doing in my room?

231
00:12:57,061 --> 00:12:58,553
I know.

232
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:00,553
This was her room, right?

233
00:13:02,635 --> 00:13:04,228
I guess they haven't
moved her stuff yet,

234
00:13:04,253 --> 00:13:07,190
but Fogg said space was limited, so...

235
00:13:09,072 --> 00:13:10,539
I talked to Kady.

236
00:13:10,564 --> 00:13:12,501
What, no respect for the dead, Q?

237
00:13:12,645 --> 00:13:15,178
You're just gonna let her sit on my bed?

238
00:13:15,982 --> 00:13:18,272
Jules, I don't know what to say.

239
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,951
Say what you're thinking.

240
00:13:19,986 --> 00:13:21,721
That I'm cursed.

241
00:13:21,746 --> 00:13:23,815
Must've been a serial
killer in a past life.

242
00:13:23,856 --> 00:13:25,625
Yeah, raise your hand
if she's the reason

243
00:13:25,657 --> 00:13:27,860
that you fucking exploded in this life.

244
00:13:27,894 --> 00:13:29,764
I'm sorry for everything
that's happened.

245
00:13:29,789 --> 00:13:30,897
Yeah, speak for yourself.

246
00:13:30,922 --> 00:13:32,210
For everything that
you're going through.

247
00:13:32,235 --> 00:13:34,022
Mm, now you're just lying to her, Q.

248
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:36,107
I'm sorry. I'm just having a hard time.

249
00:13:36,132 --> 00:13:39,803
- Yeah, because you blame her.
- I'm not blaming you for Alice.

250
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,444
If I'm being honest.

251
00:13:42,469 --> 00:13:44,546
No, if I make you feel
so shitty, just go.

252
00:13:44,571 --> 00:13:46,091
- No.
- Why?

253
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,968
I'm the reason. If
I'm the reason, then...

254
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,582
'Cause that doesn't feel right either.

255
00:13:49,614 --> 00:13:51,784
I don't know what's right.

256
00:13:53,118 --> 00:13:56,260
My best friend in the
world does crazy shit

257
00:13:56,285 --> 00:13:57,991
and doesn't trust me
and doesn't listen to me.

258
00:13:58,024 --> 00:13:59,759
It is not that simple, and you know it.

259
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:02,694
I don't... What am I supposed to do?

260
00:14:02,728 --> 00:14:05,631
You guys are both so goddamn maudlin.

261
00:14:18,044 --> 00:14:21,193
I promised you, in Fillory,

262
00:14:21,914 --> 00:14:24,918
when you told me about Reynard,
that I would help you somehow,

263
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:27,365
and that is not a promise

264
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:30,447
that I intend on breaking.

265
00:14:35,571 --> 00:14:37,840
So if there's anything that I can do...

266
00:14:37,865 --> 00:14:39,600
Actually, there is.

267
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,221
Help us rob a bank.

268
00:14:43,505 --> 00:14:45,300
Oh, my God, yes.

269
00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:49,182
You say yes.

270
00:14:51,676 --> 00:14:53,146
It's for Professor Mayakovsky!

271
00:14:53,179 --> 00:14:56,182
It was destroyed by other books.

272
00:14:56,214 --> 00:14:57,916
"Future Movements of Magic"

273
00:14:57,949 --> 00:14:59,518
was written by a Polish scientist

274
00:14:59,551 --> 00:15:01,086
who happened to be a...

275
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,424
What?

276
00:15:02,449 --> 00:15:03,923
Jew.

277
00:15:03,955 --> 00:15:06,492
So the eugenics books came for it.

278
00:15:06,526 --> 00:15:07,794
I'm really sorry.

279
00:15:07,827 --> 00:15:09,504
They've been put in
the restricted section

280
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:11,504
with the other anti-Semitic texts.

281
00:15:20,868 --> 00:15:22,306
Hey.

282
00:15:25,249 --> 00:15:26,907
I'm...

283
00:15:29,048 --> 00:15:30,879
Long story.

284
00:15:33,514 --> 00:15:35,348
Anyway...

285
00:16:26,992 --> 00:16:29,161
There's our little king.

286
00:16:30,726 --> 00:16:33,947
So how have you been since, um...

287
00:16:33,972 --> 00:16:36,475
Uh, I'm managing.

288
00:16:37,717 --> 00:16:38,885
Um, how are things with you guys?

289
00:16:38,918 --> 00:16:41,946
Glad you asked. We're at war.

290
00:16:41,971 --> 00:16:46,125
Also, Fillory is seriously,
dangerously stone-cold broke.

291
00:16:46,157 --> 00:16:47,926
Wait, how is that even possible?

292
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:49,761
The Nugget Beetles of the Outer Islands,

293
00:16:49,795 --> 00:16:51,296
they literally shit precious stones.

294
00:16:51,329 --> 00:16:53,065
Going extinct, apparently.

295
00:16:53,098 --> 00:16:55,801
Ember shitting in the
power grid really screwed us

296
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:57,336
in a cornucopia of ways.

297
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,640
And before you ask, yes,
every alchemist in history

298
00:17:00,673 --> 00:17:03,557
is a lying, cheating illusionist.

299
00:17:03,582 --> 00:17:05,644
They turn lead into gold.
It turns right back in a day.

300
00:17:05,678 --> 00:17:08,081
So we are boned.

301
00:17:09,814 --> 00:17:12,686
How would you guys feel
about robbing a bank?

302
00:17:16,354 --> 00:17:17,975
Whew.

303
00:17:19,863 --> 00:17:21,382
So...

304
00:17:22,728 --> 00:17:24,624
what are you really up to?

305
00:17:30,763 --> 00:17:32,265
We need to rob a bank.

306
00:17:34,448 --> 00:17:37,385
A bank heist. Wow.

307
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,879
Hmm, I think the time
we've invested in him

308
00:17:39,911 --> 00:17:41,213
may actually pay off.

309
00:17:41,247 --> 00:17:42,348
Mm-hmm.

310
00:17:42,381 --> 00:17:45,292
Okay, first, there's
something I have to tell you.

311
00:17:45,317 --> 00:17:47,953
You're not gonna like
it, but hear me out.

312
00:17:47,987 --> 00:17:50,957
For Julia? The psychopath?

313
00:17:51,027 --> 00:17:53,546
The victim of a fucking rape

314
00:17:53,571 --> 00:17:56,157
by a trickster god.

315
00:17:58,064 --> 00:18:01,123
Look, I got to do this, okay? I owe her.

316
00:18:05,227 --> 00:18:06,362
So?

317
00:18:06,387 --> 00:18:10,246
You gonna ask the traveler you
just fucked the shit out of to help?

318
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:13,746
I mean, no, I didn't really
feel like I had the right.

319
00:18:13,778 --> 00:18:15,379
That's noble.

320
00:18:16,282 --> 00:18:17,942
But ask.

321
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:22,294
Not gonna lie, I always
wanted to rob a bank.

322
00:18:31,433 --> 00:18:34,603
To our little thievery corporation.

323
00:18:37,803 --> 00:18:39,475
PS, we still hate you.

324
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:40,939
But it's the 21st century.

325
00:18:40,972 --> 00:18:42,307
Shouldn't be this hard for a girl

326
00:18:42,341 --> 00:18:44,142
to get an evil demigod abortion.

327
00:18:44,176 --> 00:18:45,631
And we're emotionally advanced.

328
00:18:45,656 --> 00:18:48,553
We can hold resentment and sympathy
for a person at the same time.

329
00:18:48,578 --> 00:18:50,400
And Fillory's broke. We need gold.

330
00:18:50,425 --> 00:18:53,285
So lucky you.

331
00:18:53,318 --> 00:18:54,645
Thank you.

332
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,724
Okay, uh...

333
00:18:57,456 --> 00:18:59,759
so if this heist is happening,

334
00:18:59,792 --> 00:19:01,994
any ideas as to how?

335
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,046
Well, we cased the bank.

336
00:19:04,071 --> 00:19:06,704
There was a pretty gnarly
ward around the vault.

337
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:09,165
Who here's actually robbed a bank?

338
00:19:10,835 --> 00:19:12,384
When was this?

339
00:19:12,409 --> 00:19:14,124
Senior year of high school.

340
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,242
I had some issues.

341
00:19:17,276 --> 00:19:19,679
Okay, listen up,

342
00:19:19,704 --> 00:19:22,514
'cause I'm only gonna go
through this shit once.

343
00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:24,182
Any bank worth robbing

344
00:19:24,216 --> 00:19:27,091
uses one of a handful
of security systems.

345
00:19:27,116 --> 00:19:29,055
All the usual bells and whistles.

346
00:19:29,087 --> 00:19:31,177
But what most idiots don't know

347
00:19:31,202 --> 00:19:34,192
is, those companies are
all owned by Magicians.

348
00:19:34,226 --> 00:19:36,195
Wait, so the people that work there...

349
00:19:36,228 --> 00:19:39,370
Clueless. Tellers,
managers, security guards.

350
00:19:39,395 --> 00:19:40,542
They're all Muggles.

351
00:19:40,567 --> 00:19:43,535
They have no idea the
vault has a secret feature.

352
00:19:43,568 --> 00:19:44,970
Serious wards.

353
00:19:45,004 --> 00:19:48,357
Designed specifically
to keep out Magicians.

354
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:50,739
Now, in the case of our target,

355
00:19:50,764 --> 00:19:53,740
their fingerprints
control the alarm systems.

356
00:19:54,834 --> 00:19:56,215
It takes two managers

357
00:19:56,247 --> 00:19:58,803
scanning their prints simultaneously

358
00:19:58,828 --> 00:19:59,919
to do this.

359
00:19:59,951 --> 00:20:02,455
Once both the alarms
and the wards go down,

360
00:20:02,487 --> 00:20:05,091
you've got ten minutes
to get downstairs,

361
00:20:05,123 --> 00:20:06,629
past the armed guards,

362
00:20:06,654 --> 00:20:09,502
and enter in the
correct ten-digit combo.

363
00:20:09,527 --> 00:20:11,364
If you screw up the combination

364
00:20:11,397 --> 00:20:13,399
or you take longer than ten minutes,

365
00:20:13,431 --> 00:20:14,582
you're fucked.

366
00:20:14,607 --> 00:20:17,970
Now, basic bitches trip all
the standard alarm systems,

367
00:20:18,003 --> 00:20:19,372
but Magicians?

368
00:20:19,404 --> 00:20:23,575
We also trip the magic
wards, which means...

369
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,228
battle Magicians.

370
00:20:25,253 --> 00:20:29,056
Full-time security employees
on the DL, with benefits.

371
00:20:29,081 --> 00:20:31,083
You see one, run.

372
00:20:31,115 --> 00:20:33,920
They only ask questions post-mortem.

373
00:20:33,952 --> 00:20:35,987
But our ace is you.

374
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:39,057
Once we nab prints and drop the wards,

375
00:20:39,091 --> 00:20:40,426
you travel straight in.

376
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:42,828
You really don't think a
bank vault, of all places,

377
00:20:42,862 --> 00:20:44,497
has anti-traveler protection?

378
00:20:44,529 --> 00:20:45,864
Oh, they do.

379
00:20:45,898 --> 00:20:47,178
The entire floor of the vault

380
00:20:47,203 --> 00:20:49,268
is one big anti-traveling sigil.

381
00:20:49,301 --> 00:20:52,138
You get locked in till
you run out of air.

382
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:55,274
Yeah. Pass. I like air.

383
00:20:55,306 --> 00:20:57,043
Relax, dummy.

384
00:20:57,075 --> 00:20:59,452
You only get stuck if you hit the floor.

385
00:20:59,477 --> 00:21:01,413
Oh, so it's like "Mission: Impossible."

386
00:21:01,447 --> 00:21:04,150
That movie was stupidly unrealistic.

387
00:21:04,182 --> 00:21:06,551
It's so much easier to just levitate.

388
00:21:06,584 --> 00:21:08,417
Yeah, I don't know how,

389
00:21:08,442 --> 00:21:10,175
and in case you guys have all forgotten,

390
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,489
I can't do magic.

391
00:21:11,523 --> 00:21:14,160
Oh, that's fine. This
is gonna get done to you.

392
00:21:14,192 --> 00:21:15,831
It's a little thingy

393
00:21:15,856 --> 00:21:17,563
any Physical Kid can
make in their sleep.

394
00:21:17,595 --> 00:21:19,364
Gravity belt. Exactly.

395
00:21:19,398 --> 00:21:22,635
Once we drop the wards, float Penny,

396
00:21:22,668 --> 00:21:26,915
he zips in, he zips out... payday.

397
00:21:28,378 --> 00:21:29,942
Julia, run!

398
00:21:30,032 --> 00:21:31,768
It's there. You just don't see it. Go!

399
00:21:31,793 --> 00:21:33,612
- I thought it was dead.
- I guess it's got friends.

400
00:21:33,645 --> 00:21:35,447
- Kady, come on.
- No, you go. I'll catch up.

401
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,008
- Kady!
- No! I need to kill it.

402
00:21:37,033 --> 00:21:38,227
- I'll be fine.
- Why?

403
00:21:38,258 --> 00:21:40,485
- I need its spoon.
- Spoon?

404
00:21:53,656 --> 00:21:55,234
This is yours, isn't it?

405
00:21:55,266 --> 00:21:57,653
You sent those things
after Julia, didn't you?

406
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,844
See, this is what happen
when you don't pay.

407
00:22:03,869 --> 00:22:05,008
Jehn-jang.

408
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:07,580
- Lady, use your words.
- Dak-chuh!

409
00:22:07,612 --> 00:22:09,368
This is for dokkaebi.

410
00:22:09,515 --> 00:22:11,484
How you say... goblin.

411
00:22:11,516 --> 00:22:12,684
Invisible, right?

412
00:22:12,718 --> 00:22:14,282
- Yeah.
- Right.

413
00:22:14,307 --> 00:22:15,842
This is very old magic.

414
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:18,203
You bring to life using
old, abandoned things,

415
00:22:18,228 --> 00:22:20,230
like this wooden spoon...

416
00:22:20,426 --> 00:22:21,883
and menstrual blood.

417
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,680
Probably Moon's.

418
00:22:25,461 --> 00:22:27,032
These creatures are mercenaries.

419
00:22:27,065 --> 00:22:28,333
They won't stop.

420
00:22:28,366 --> 00:22:31,703
You kill one, another
one grows in its place.

421
00:22:31,737 --> 00:22:33,104
Very fucked up.

422
00:22:33,138 --> 00:22:34,674
Why the hell would she do that?

423
00:22:34,707 --> 00:22:36,074
To kill your friend.

424
00:22:36,108 --> 00:22:37,710
I told Moon to relax,

425
00:22:37,743 --> 00:22:39,211
but she's all, "Baby's too evil.

426
00:22:39,244 --> 00:22:41,234
"It might hurt more people."

427
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:42,560
She wants to play it safe

428
00:22:42,585 --> 00:22:44,587
and kill both spawn and mom together.

429
00:22:44,682 --> 00:22:46,184
She's so stupid.

430
00:22:46,218 --> 00:22:48,420
You won't pay if your friend is dead.

431
00:22:48,453 --> 00:22:51,067
Listen, we are trying to
get you the money, okay?

432
00:22:51,092 --> 00:22:53,133
If you want to get paid so fucking bad,

433
00:22:53,158 --> 00:22:54,593
tell her to call it off.

434
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:57,425
Can't. She has a hundred spoons.

435
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:00,365
Dokkaebi will not stop
until trickster baby is dead,

436
00:23:00,399 --> 00:23:02,168
so you got two options.

437
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,202
I can exorcise for you,

438
00:23:04,236 --> 00:23:06,923
or monster rips your
friend's head off her neck.

439
00:23:06,948 --> 00:23:08,976
So hurry up with my gold.

440
00:23:21,687 --> 00:23:23,259
Hey.

441
00:23:24,358 --> 00:23:25,760
What's that?

442
00:23:25,785 --> 00:23:27,019
You remember that one time

443
00:23:27,044 --> 00:23:29,036
Richard and the Free
Traders rewound time?

444
00:23:29,061 --> 00:23:31,063
- Déjà pizza?
- Yeah.

445
00:23:31,095 --> 00:23:33,145
I think this is how they did it.

446
00:23:34,466 --> 00:23:36,569
That was heavy cooperative magic.

447
00:23:36,594 --> 00:23:39,497
Yeah, well, there are
notes for version 2.0 here.

448
00:23:39,537 --> 00:23:42,141
I mean, it's more
efficient. Takes less juice.

449
00:23:42,173 --> 00:23:44,075
Either one of us could run it.

450
00:23:44,109 --> 00:23:45,773
Let's see.

451
00:23:50,149 --> 00:23:52,051
"The Quarterback"?

452
00:23:52,083 --> 00:23:53,753
Goes back 15 seconds.

453
00:23:53,785 --> 00:23:56,395
Get it? Quarter of a minute?

454
00:23:57,122 --> 00:23:59,778
Yeah, Richard did like his dad jokes.

455
00:24:01,008 --> 00:24:03,370
Anyway, I thought it could be useful,

456
00:24:03,395 --> 00:24:05,131
but at this rate,

457
00:24:05,163 --> 00:24:07,232
I won't actually get
it to work for weeks.

458
00:24:07,266 --> 00:24:09,267
And I guess I'd be weighed
down lugging it anyway.

459
00:24:09,301 --> 00:24:12,237
It's got a pretty small
radius of influence.

460
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:14,861
Julia, you can't come.

461
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,025
What?

462
00:24:17,409 --> 00:24:19,178
Those invisible blood-goblin things,

463
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:20,703
they won't stop coming.

464
00:24:20,728 --> 00:24:23,516
I mean, not until your problem's dead,

465
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:26,939
meaning you are.

466
00:24:26,964 --> 00:24:29,121
If you step out from
under these wards...

467
00:24:29,153 --> 00:24:31,295
It'll find me and all of you.

468
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:35,127
So I'm supposed to, what, just
wait here, fingers crossed,

469
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,129
while everyone who blames
me for Alice's death

470
00:24:37,161 --> 00:24:38,264
risks their life?

471
00:24:38,296 --> 00:24:39,928
I mean, how does that even make sense?

472
00:24:39,953 --> 00:24:42,824
Just 'cause you can't come
doesn't mean you can't be there.

473
00:24:44,702 --> 00:24:47,539
You can listen in and watch.

474
00:24:51,655 --> 00:24:53,112
All right, but if anything goes wrong...

475
00:24:53,144 --> 00:24:55,358
Nothing will. Okay?

476
00:25:06,826 --> 00:25:10,115
Librarian, Neck Beard,
and White Privilege.

477
00:25:10,295 --> 00:25:13,498
They're the managers. We
need two of their prints.

478
00:25:13,532 --> 00:25:17,810
The good news is, they all go
to the same lame bar after work.

479
00:25:18,437 --> 00:25:21,920
I'll take White Privilege.
Kady, you take Neck Beard.

480
00:25:22,326 --> 00:25:25,443
Oh, nut up. It's just a finger.

481
00:25:25,477 --> 00:25:29,247
Walk up to him, grab his hand,
and say, "Can I borrow this?"

482
00:25:29,281 --> 00:25:31,122
Dip his stupid finger in his drink

483
00:25:31,147 --> 00:25:33,256
to sanitize it, and...

484
00:25:34,353 --> 00:25:37,422
pop it in your mouth, walk away,

485
00:25:37,456 --> 00:25:40,373
yet stay emblazoned on
his heart for a lifetime.

486
00:25:40,398 --> 00:25:42,357
Done and done.

487
00:25:43,263 --> 00:25:44,270
Fine.

488
00:25:44,295 --> 00:25:45,490
Why does it got to be Kady?

489
00:25:45,515 --> 00:25:47,299
It could be Penny or Eliot.

490
00:25:47,332 --> 00:25:49,013
- Or you.
- Yeah.

491
00:25:49,349 --> 00:25:51,202
Sounded like volunteering.

492
00:25:51,236 --> 00:25:53,629
- Okay, fine, I'll take the librarian.
- Ha-ha.

493
00:25:53,654 --> 00:25:55,741
Great. Quentin will go in my place.

494
00:25:55,774 --> 00:25:57,402
Thanks, Q.

495
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:12,302
So he really just stuck
that in your mouth?

496
00:26:12,327 --> 00:26:13,540
Yup.

497
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,670
That is how the spell works.

498
00:26:16,695 --> 00:26:18,407
Damn.

499
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:24,836
Unexpectedly, I'm somehow
turned on right now.

500
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:26,733
Oh, really?

501
00:26:27,272 --> 00:26:29,351
- Look at this idiot.
- Ugh.

502
00:26:30,275 --> 00:26:31,867
Took you long enough.

503
00:26:33,136 --> 00:26:35,139
So show us the goods.

504
00:26:38,217 --> 00:26:39,517
Oh, God.

505
00:26:39,551 --> 00:26:41,387
Oh, that's bad.

506
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,622
How'd you get it in your mouth?

507
00:26:45,256 --> 00:26:47,747
Oh, it wasn't with your mouth, was it?

508
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:49,045
- Wh...
- Oh!

509
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:51,489
- Oh, shit!
- Mm-mm.

510
00:26:51,862 --> 00:26:54,099
She went Digital Underground?

511
00:26:54,124 --> 00:26:56,294
- Oh, God.
- Whoo!

512
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,121
What else do we have to do?

513
00:26:58,146 --> 00:26:59,737
With these, we're golden.

514
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:02,975
Margo and Eliot grabbed everything
else we need for the morning.

515
00:27:03,007 --> 00:27:05,343
So go rest up, Goldwater.

516
00:27:05,406 --> 00:27:07,138
You've earned it.

517
00:27:15,987 --> 00:27:17,323
All right.

518
00:27:17,355 --> 00:27:19,724
Stick to the plan precisely,

519
00:27:19,757 --> 00:27:21,526
and we should be golden.

520
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,828
I'll be right here waiting,

521
00:27:22,861 --> 00:27:23,963
engines running.

522
00:27:23,996 --> 00:27:25,464
Of course you will.

523
00:27:25,497 --> 00:27:26,864
The brains of the operation

524
00:27:26,898 --> 00:27:28,365
drives the getaway.

525
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:30,857
- Everyone knows that.
- Of course.

526
00:27:31,603 --> 00:27:35,005
Okay, bitches. Let's do this.

527
00:27:47,067 --> 00:27:49,526
- Thanks, Jimmy.
- Yeah.

528
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:10,181
Ah!

529
00:28:28,962 --> 00:28:30,245
Good luck.

530
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:15,926
All right. Let's set the clocks.

531
00:29:22,107 --> 00:29:23,319
Okay.

532
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,873
Three, two, one.

533
00:29:30,207 --> 00:29:33,011
Okay. Alarms and wards are down.

534
00:29:33,043 --> 00:29:35,513
It's up to Penny now.

535
00:29:36,781 --> 00:29:38,149
Let's go.

536
00:29:46,925 --> 00:29:50,462
Wait. Oh, shit. Um...

537
00:29:56,324 --> 00:29:57,701
Ha-ha.

538
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,947
Oh, shit.

539
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,259
Shit!

540
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,004
God damn it.

541
00:31:04,735 --> 00:31:06,426
Fuck.

542
00:31:06,888 --> 00:31:08,757
Fucking Physical Kids.

543
00:31:11,032 --> 00:31:13,618
Penny's only got one
minute. Where the hell is he?

544
00:31:14,611 --> 00:31:16,766
Cutting it a little
close, don't you think?

545
00:31:16,829 --> 00:31:18,148
So where's the booty?

546
00:31:18,182 --> 00:31:19,584
Eliot, who are you talking to?

547
00:31:19,617 --> 00:31:21,493
They can't see me. I'm
not technically here.

548
00:31:21,518 --> 00:31:22,887
I'm incepting your ass!

549
00:31:22,921 --> 00:31:24,956
Your head. Your dreams.

550
00:31:24,989 --> 00:31:27,058
You're still asleep
in Fillory, remember?

551
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:28,859
That is overly complicated.

552
00:31:28,893 --> 00:31:31,358
You know what's not?
The sigil I just touched

553
00:31:31,383 --> 00:31:33,531
'cause someone messed
up the buoyancy math.

554
00:31:33,563 --> 00:31:35,166
Oh, that is not good.

555
00:31:35,198 --> 00:31:36,749
Eliot, what's going on?

556
00:31:36,774 --> 00:31:38,904
How do I put this? Penny fucked up.

557
00:31:38,936 --> 00:31:41,171
No, it's your stupid
device. I'm stuck now.

558
00:31:41,204 --> 00:31:43,040
Penny's incepting my... never mind.

559
00:31:43,073 --> 00:31:45,276
Just trust me, we have to
get him out of that vault now.

560
00:31:46,434 --> 00:31:49,154
Or, say, sometime in
the previous ten minutes.

561
00:31:49,179 --> 00:31:52,016
Fuck. Shit.

562
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:53,752
Shit, let's go!

563
00:31:53,784 --> 00:31:55,954
Tell her I'm fine. I'm
just... I'm running out of air.

564
00:31:55,986 --> 00:31:57,423
Well, way to mix the message.

565
00:32:01,358 --> 00:32:03,160
Hey, Margo, keep the engine running.

566
00:32:03,194 --> 00:32:04,296
I'll inform the bank manager

567
00:32:04,329 --> 00:32:06,376
the bees are resisting extermination

568
00:32:06,401 --> 00:32:08,265
and everyone needs to
stay clear a little longer.

569
00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:10,734
Let's go, kids. We're going back in.

570
00:32:25,082 --> 00:32:27,068
- Shh. Quiet.
- Stop it.

571
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:29,418
You...

572
00:32:30,005 --> 00:32:32,568
- you are bad.
- No, you're bad.

573
00:32:38,201 --> 00:32:39,830
- Oh, shit.
- What?

574
00:32:39,864 --> 00:32:42,154
- Guards.
- What? I thought they evacuated.

575
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:44,615
I got this. I brought
the perfect weapon.

576
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,875
Wait, you're not gonna...

577
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,813
Kill them? God, no.

578
00:32:47,838 --> 00:32:50,912
The Wrecking Ball is a weapon of peace.

579
00:32:51,142 --> 00:32:53,812
Trust me. I'm a genius.

580
00:32:55,379 --> 00:32:57,114
Read the book, and then
you watch the movie,

581
00:32:57,147 --> 00:32:58,349
and it's always just whiny.

582
00:33:00,251 --> 00:33:02,212
I'm totally disappointed in the book.

583
00:33:02,237 --> 00:33:03,562
Mind if I read you?

584
00:33:03,587 --> 00:33:04,986
Stop it.

585
00:33:05,011 --> 00:33:06,112
Stop it!

00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:49,768
at our cottage soirees,
but it came on a bit strong.

597
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,102
Shit.

598
00:33:57,866 --> 00:33:59,574
There's no way we can pick this lock.

599
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:01,146
Maybe we can brute-force it.

600
00:34:01,178 --> 00:34:05,149
Hold on. I think this door
is too thick, even for you.

601
00:34:05,183 --> 00:34:06,508
Okay, just so we're
all on the same page,

602
00:34:06,533 --> 00:34:08,133
we've got less than four minutes.

603
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,984
Penny! We're getting you out!

604
00:34:12,104 --> 00:34:14,640
I don't even think Alice could
do this in under four minutes.

605
00:34:14,665 --> 00:34:16,968
Maybe not then, but
now I could do it in 15.

606
00:34:16,993 --> 00:34:18,296
Seconds.

607
00:34:18,329 --> 00:34:20,351
Oh, well. Rest in peace, Penny.

608
00:34:21,932 --> 00:34:23,781
Well, I guess I could help.

609
00:34:23,806 --> 00:34:25,312
For a price.

610
00:34:26,296 --> 00:34:27,736
I want to drive.

611
00:34:27,761 --> 00:34:29,948
For an hour a day, I
get control of your body.

612
00:34:29,973 --> 00:34:32,977
Okay, okay. Maybe we break
this up. We split up the work.

613
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:34,345
I don't even know where to start.

614
00:34:34,377 --> 00:34:35,914
Well, we can't just stand here!

615
00:34:35,946 --> 00:34:37,082
I wouldn't hurt anyone.

616
00:34:37,115 --> 00:34:39,850
I just want to stretch the tiniest bit.

617
00:34:39,883 --> 00:34:41,088
Breathe.

618
00:34:41,277 --> 00:34:43,385
You set the terms. We could
even do a "word as bond"

619
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:45,088
so that I can't break it.

620
00:34:47,084 --> 00:34:49,653
Okay. 30 minutes. That's all you get.

621
00:34:49,678 --> 00:34:52,354
After we hash out the "word as bond."

622
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:54,064
Great.

623
00:34:54,097 --> 00:34:55,432
You try anything crazy...

624
00:34:55,466 --> 00:34:57,135
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Box.

625
00:34:57,167 --> 00:34:58,403
Is it a deal?

626
00:34:58,435 --> 00:34:59,803
Fine, it's a deal.

627
00:34:59,836 --> 00:35:01,371
Are you talking to yourself?

628
00:35:02,061 --> 00:35:04,677
No. Yes. Uh...

629
00:35:05,927 --> 00:35:08,778
Yes. I'm just... I'm doing
long division in my head.

630
00:35:08,803 --> 00:35:10,724
Move. Move.

631
00:35:41,546 --> 00:35:43,915
I've always been good at math.

632
00:35:45,216 --> 00:35:47,886
- Hi. You okay?
- Oh, shit. Yeah, I'm okay.

633
00:35:47,919 --> 00:35:49,053
- Okay.
- All right.

634
00:35:49,086 --> 00:35:50,568
Princess rescued.

635
00:35:50,593 --> 00:35:52,995
Let's collect our reward and go.

636
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,198
Yes!

637
00:36:04,035 --> 00:36:05,904
Oh, shit.

638
00:36:07,143 --> 00:36:09,112
Q, stop! Oh!

639
00:36:09,137 --> 00:36:10,374
Shit! Oh, no.

640
00:36:45,142 --> 00:36:46,812
- Let's go!
- Come on.

641
00:36:47,694 --> 00:36:48,963
Okay.

642
00:36:49,247 --> 00:36:50,882
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

643
00:36:50,914 --> 00:36:52,950
Go back! Go back! Go back!

644
00:37:00,701 --> 00:37:02,419
Shit.

645
00:37:04,227 --> 00:37:07,131
Oh, shit, shit, shit!

646
00:37:12,669 --> 00:37:14,221
Well, why should I go out there first?

647
00:37:14,246 --> 00:37:15,862
You're the battle Magician.

648
00:37:15,887 --> 00:37:17,596
What about another Wrecking Ball?

649
00:37:17,621 --> 00:37:19,388
It was a one-off.

650
00:37:23,531 --> 00:37:25,266
Oh, shit.

651
00:37:28,117 --> 00:37:30,854
You're the... the battle Magician.

652
00:37:30,879 --> 00:37:33,272
- Wait, did we just...
- Go back in time?

653
00:37:33,297 --> 00:37:35,304
Yeah. Julia?

654
00:37:35,338 --> 00:37:37,428
I'm outside. I can see
you in the van's mirror.

655
00:37:37,453 --> 00:37:39,592
The effect reaches far enough?

656
00:37:40,095 --> 00:37:41,920
Listen, you only have four rewinds.

657
00:37:41,945 --> 00:37:43,084
Julia's outside.

658
00:37:43,109 --> 00:37:45,511
She's watching with a
machine that can rewind time.

659
00:37:55,227 --> 00:37:56,729
Let's go!

660
00:38:01,104 --> 00:38:02,172
You're the...

661
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:04,067
Kady, three rewinds left.

662
00:38:04,092 --> 00:38:05,690
She can only go back 15 seconds.

663
00:38:05,715 --> 00:38:06,862
Let's go!

664
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,988
- You're the...
- Two rewinds left.

665
00:38:25,567 --> 00:38:26,839
Penny!

666
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:28,992
Kady, last rewind.

667
00:38:29,024 --> 00:38:30,456
Okay, look. We need a plan.

668
00:38:30,481 --> 00:38:32,869
Okay. Okay, I'll blast the bitch.

669
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:34,425
You all run left. She's
always on the right.

670
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:36,577
Is she? 'Cause the last time, I
thought she was more in the middle.

671
00:38:36,602 --> 00:38:38,404
15 seconds!

672
00:38:49,303 --> 00:38:50,438
Let's go.

673
00:38:57,443 --> 00:38:58,923
Kady!

674
00:39:02,111 --> 00:39:03,485
Julia.

675
00:39:04,327 --> 00:39:05,896
Julia, answer me.

676
00:39:06,937 --> 00:39:09,072
Shit. Let's go.

677
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,306
Q, come on. Grab the bar.

678
00:39:11,331 --> 00:39:13,892
- But...
- Grab the bar! Let's go!

679
00:39:13,917 --> 00:39:15,367
- What about...
- It's clay.

680
00:39:15,392 --> 00:39:17,096
Eliot's fine. Let's go!

681
00:39:18,793 --> 00:39:20,143
Eliot?

682
00:39:20,277 --> 00:39:22,869
Eliot! Eliot!

683
00:39:23,471 --> 00:39:24,814
Guards!

684
00:39:42,323 --> 00:39:43,992
Julia. Are you okay?

685
00:39:44,017 --> 00:39:46,086
Jules. Julia?

686
00:39:46,158 --> 00:39:48,125
- Talk to me.
- Julia, stay with us.

687
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:49,370
Talk to me. Are you all right?

688
00:39:49,395 --> 00:39:50,563
It's gonna be fine.
We're gonna get help.

689
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:52,065
- It's gonna be okay.
- Julia.

690
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,566
- Julia.
- Come on. Hey.

691
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,736
- Julia.
- Jules, stay with us. Come on.

692
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,304
Julia?

693
00:40:06,295 --> 00:40:07,630
Hey.

694
00:40:10,406 --> 00:40:12,720
No, don't move around too much.

695
00:40:12,939 --> 00:40:15,962
Sun patched you up, but
it's gonna take a while.

696
00:40:18,103 --> 00:40:20,020
Did she do it?

697
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,165
Did it work? Is it gone?

698
00:40:23,701 --> 00:40:25,437
Yeah.

699
00:40:25,462 --> 00:40:27,290
She did it.

700
00:40:28,069 --> 00:40:30,160
But, Julia...

701
00:40:31,878 --> 00:40:33,925
there was a complication.
