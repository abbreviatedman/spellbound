1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,769
<i>- Previously
on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:08,073
- No, no, no.
- Don't you fucking touch her.

3
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:09,575
Fine, I'll take you first.

4
00:00:09,577 --> 00:00:11,477
No!
No.

5
00:00:14,148 --> 00:00:15,781
- Now!

6
00:00:15,783 --> 00:00:17,116
- Julia.
- Move!

7
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:19,385
Wait.

8
00:00:19,387 --> 00:00:21,587
- I had Reynard.
I had the beast.

9
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:23,589
- Man, fuck this.
We're out.

10
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:28,227
The chain was the only thing
keeping my hand from...

11
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:31,397
- sorry.
Not my problem.

12
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:33,065
- Do you know what a niffin is?

13
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:34,266
It's when too much
runs through you,

14
00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:35,367
<i>consumes you.</i>

15
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,269
<i>Only the magic is left.</i>

16
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:42,141
- Hard to cast
when you're sliced in two.

17
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:46,078
What is she doing?

18
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,147
She can't.
She'll niffin out.

19
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,481
Alice, stop.

20
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:56,121
- Let's finally finish this.

21
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:58,123
- He did it on purpose.

22
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:06,398
- Alice, don't.

23
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,172
- Five surgeries.
- He'll recover.

24
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:49,408
- I know we're being serious
right now,

25
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,411
but that surgeon
has the biggest dick.

26
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:00,586
Eliot, it's time to go.

27
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,323
- Our kingdom awaits.

28
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,667
- With the beast dead, there's
a power vacuum in Fillory.

29
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,336
- Power vacuum?

30
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:19,905
Hello?
High king and queen right here.

31
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:23,208
- We, of course, recognize your
rule, but others...

32
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,710
- everyone assumes
you'll be dead soon...

33
00:02:24,712 --> 00:02:28,680
Or you'll run away
or vanish or go mad.

34
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:30,349
- There are stirrings
of rebellion

35
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:32,284
in the Southern orchard,
the outer islands,

36
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:34,219
refusal to pay
the crown's taxes.

37
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:36,421
- You know who loves
paying taxes?

38
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:38,357
People with broken legs.

39
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:41,527
- Abigail would remind you

40
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:43,629
that money cannot fill
the wellspring.

41
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:45,364
Without it, Fillory withers.

42
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:47,399
- Okay, well,
we talked about this.

43
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:49,401
When someone drops a log
at a public pool,

44
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:51,537
you just send a kid with a net
to fish it out.

45
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:55,507
- The befouling
was substantial, your majesty.

46
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,509
We've employed
several filtration systems,

47
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:00,245
but the wellspring
isn't recovering fast enough.

48
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:02,481
- If there was a royal appeal
to ember himself...

49
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:04,383
- okay, we can't find him.

50
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:07,252
He's not in his temple
or his filthy sex cave.

51
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:08,620
- We need to devote
more resources.

52
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:09,955
- We're going to build
a monument

53
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:11,523
to our fallen queen...

54
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,226
A statue, I think...

55
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:15,527
100 feet high.

56
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:16,962
- Do you know
what that would cost?

57
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:18,964
- I don't care
how much it costs.

58
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:21,667
I want designs drawn up
and funds...

59
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:24,970
Funded immediately.

60
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:28,540
- Can you give us a moment?

61
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,543
I said get the fuck out.

62
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:39,585
So that's the plan, huh...

63
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:41,820
Blow all our cash
on sappy nonsense,

64
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:43,288
bankrupt the kingdom?

65
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,723
- We have to do something.

66
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,225
Alice was our friend.

67
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:48,627
- No. She wasn't.

68
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:51,730
Alice was a package deal.
She came with Quentin.

69
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,765
- Somebody skipped her colonic
this morning.

70
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:56,668
- For whatever stupid reason,

71
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:00,305
you're the high king
of an entire land.

72
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:01,840
You have to be
responsible, Eliot.

73
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:03,709
- Since when are you
Fillory Clinton?

74
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:05,811
- Since I'm me.

75
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:09,715
My crown is just as heavy
as yours.

76
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:12,451
- You can leave
whenever you feel like it.

77
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:14,019
You can go back to Brakebills.

78
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:17,256
You can do whatever
you goddamn want.

79
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,294
I don't belong here.

80
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:23,762
I'm not ready to be a king.

81
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:27,599
I wasn't done being me.

82
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,701
It was so much simpler
when there was just

83
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:33,472
one giant evil dick
trying to kill us.

84
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:36,375
Now we're just...
- grown-ups.

85
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:40,479
- How did this happen?

86
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:42,714
- I have an idea...
To help you.

87
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:45,651
- Like a loophole?
- Mm-hmm.

88
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:53,792
- You're gonna ironically
abandon me here to go find it.

89
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,827
- I'll be back.
I promise.

90
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,499
- I know you...

91
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:02,367
Will.

92
00:05:33,072 --> 00:05:35,940
Hey.

93
00:05:35,942 --> 00:05:39,076
- Kady?

94
00:05:39,078 --> 00:05:40,244
Hey.

95
00:05:41,948 --> 00:05:44,815
- Kady, come on,
I need your help.

96
00:05:47,153 --> 00:05:49,153
Let's go.

97
00:06:12,545 --> 00:06:15,146
- You haven't had any other
problems with your casting?

98
00:06:15,148 --> 00:06:17,281
- I've had nothing but problems.

99
00:06:17,283 --> 00:06:19,016
I thought it was because
of my hands,

100
00:06:19,018 --> 00:06:22,019
but it's getting worse,
not better.

101
00:06:22,021 --> 00:06:24,855
- Hmm.

102
00:06:24,857 --> 00:06:29,093
I've had a few...
Brownouts, you could call them.

103
00:06:29,095 --> 00:06:31,362
I mean, I thought it was
the Xanax, honestly.

104
00:06:31,364 --> 00:06:33,030
- How many?

105
00:06:33,032 --> 00:06:35,966
- Two a day if I can get them.

106
00:06:35,968 --> 00:06:37,301
Oh, you mean the brownouts.

107
00:06:37,303 --> 00:06:39,570
Four or five.

108
00:06:39,572 --> 00:06:40,905
Hmm.

109
00:06:44,209 --> 00:06:46,210
- Yes.

110
00:06:54,821 --> 00:06:56,921
- What happened?

111
00:06:56,923 --> 00:06:58,856
- I'm trying to get back here,
but my aim's off.

112
00:06:58,858 --> 00:07:01,125
- Okay, all right, it seems like
more than your aim.

113
00:07:01,127 --> 00:07:02,293
- Last three worlds I've been in

114
00:07:02,295 --> 00:07:04,161
haven't had any fucking oxygen.

115
00:07:04,163 --> 00:07:07,031
My fingers just... they just...
They just keep shorting me out.

116
00:07:09,435 --> 00:07:12,303
What happened?
Did we kill the beast?

117
00:07:12,305 --> 00:07:14,305
- We did.

118
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:20,444
- But, um, Quentin's
pretty banged up.

119
00:07:20,446 --> 00:07:23,247
Alice was hurt
a lot worse, penny.

120
00:07:25,917 --> 00:07:28,452
She... she died.

121
00:07:37,462 --> 00:07:41,065
- Budget?
- Citizen petitions.

122
00:07:41,067 --> 00:07:44,368
I want everyone
to stop wanting things.

123
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:48,239
Great time to ask for something?

124
00:07:48,241 --> 00:07:50,341
- Your father makes knives
for a living

125
00:07:50,343 --> 00:07:52,109
and knows where I sleep, so...

126
00:07:52,111 --> 00:07:54,311
Ask away.

127
00:07:56,314 --> 00:07:59,650
- I'm know I'm not precisely
the type

128
00:07:59,652 --> 00:08:01,886
you'd most likely choose,

129
00:08:01,888 --> 00:08:06,090
and I wasn't so experienced
when we were first together,

130
00:08:06,092 --> 00:08:07,391
but you're so great at it.

131
00:08:07,393 --> 00:08:10,361
You're... you're huge,
and it's so good.

132
00:08:10,363 --> 00:08:14,198
And, Eliot, I don't know how
to politely ask you to fuck me.

133
00:08:16,234 --> 00:08:18,335
- Oh, look, Margoâ€™s here.

134
00:08:18,337 --> 00:08:20,170
- You remember Lasaro?

135
00:08:20,172 --> 00:08:21,472
- That creep who made
the margolem?

136
00:08:21,474 --> 00:08:23,974
- I twisted his arms
and/or balls a little,

137
00:08:23,976 --> 00:08:26,010
and he gave up the spell.

138
00:08:26,012 --> 00:08:27,278
Living Clay is hard to come by,

139
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,014
but Fogg left his stash
so unprotected,

140
00:08:30,016 --> 00:08:32,249
it's like
he wanted me to steal it.

141
00:08:32,251 --> 00:08:34,985
So I did.

142
00:08:34,987 --> 00:08:37,121
We're gonna make another you.

143
00:08:43,395 --> 00:08:45,029
- Hey.

144
00:08:45,031 --> 00:08:47,998
- Made you a sandwich...
Half an hour ago.

145
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Then I ate it.

146
00:08:50,002 --> 00:08:51,502
- I'm sorry.

147
00:08:51,504 --> 00:08:54,305
It's been a long time
since I've had a hot shower.

148
00:08:54,307 --> 00:08:55,439
- How you feeling?

149
00:08:55,441 --> 00:08:57,474
- Uh...

150
00:08:57,476 --> 00:08:59,310
Better...

151
00:08:59,312 --> 00:09:02,146
Nap, seeing you alive,

152
00:09:02,148 --> 00:09:05,015
magic methadone...

153
00:09:05,017 --> 00:09:08,218
Methadone.

154
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,054
Thanks...

155
00:09:10,056 --> 00:09:12,556
For all of it.

156
00:09:12,558 --> 00:09:16,727
So, um, how did you find me?

157
00:09:16,729 --> 00:09:19,163
- After asking around a bit,
I heard about a girl

158
00:09:19,165 --> 00:09:21,298
who was doing miracles
for a quick fix.

159
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,467
- I called it
"turning tricks."

160
00:09:23,469 --> 00:09:25,369
- You think I'm judging you,
I'm not.

161
00:09:25,371 --> 00:09:29,173
- No.
No, I'm judging myself.

162
00:09:29,175 --> 00:09:32,543
You... you saved my life,

163
00:09:32,545 --> 00:09:35,212
and...

164
00:09:35,214 --> 00:09:39,183
You know, i-i thought
it would be okay to run...

165
00:09:39,185 --> 00:09:41,418
If I got the cavalry
and I came back to help you,

166
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,320
but I...

167
00:09:43,322 --> 00:09:47,091
I just ran.

168
00:09:47,093 --> 00:09:49,159
I hid.

169
00:09:49,161 --> 00:09:53,230
- Yeah, well, there was nothing
you could have done then.

170
00:09:53,232 --> 00:09:57,034
But you can help me now.

171
00:09:57,036 --> 00:09:59,303
Oh, my god.

172
00:09:59,305 --> 00:10:01,605
Ju... Julia, is that...
- marina.

173
00:10:01,607 --> 00:10:04,408
She helped me bait a trap
for Reynard.

174
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:07,111
He killed her.
- You freeze-dried her corpse?

175
00:10:07,113 --> 00:10:09,013
- Alonso's reverse
thermogenesis.

176
00:10:09,015 --> 00:10:11,348
But look...

177
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,784
She left this for a reason...

178
00:10:13,786 --> 00:10:15,185
A message or a code.

179
00:10:15,187 --> 00:10:16,487
I mean, at least
I thought that...

180
00:10:16,489 --> 00:10:18,222
- no, no.
I know exactly what that is.

181
00:10:18,224 --> 00:10:20,124
That's a locator number...

182
00:10:20,126 --> 00:10:23,093
For a book in the library
at Brakebills.

183
00:10:38,909 --> 00:10:40,343
- Be careful.

184
00:10:40,345 --> 00:10:42,946
That's a long
drop for human legs.

185
00:10:42,948 --> 00:10:44,914
We would not want to see you
get hurt

186
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:48,218
so soon after being rebuilt.

187
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,253
- "Rebuilt"?

188
00:10:54,158 --> 00:10:56,660
It's strange, I know.

189
00:10:56,662 --> 00:10:57,927
But you'll get used to it.

190
00:10:57,929 --> 00:10:59,429
- Is this a hospital?

191
00:10:59,431 --> 00:11:03,033
Are you... are you a doctor?
- You're at the retreat...

192
00:11:03,035 --> 00:11:05,335
A few hours gallop north
of Whitespire.

193
00:11:05,337 --> 00:11:07,437
I was a patient years ago.

194
00:11:07,439 --> 00:11:10,273
The centaurs saved my life
when no one else could.

195
00:11:10,275 --> 00:11:13,343
Now I try to repay that debt
by serving them as a nurse.

196
00:11:13,345 --> 00:11:15,845
- The centaurs?
- Mm-hmm.

197
00:11:15,847 --> 00:11:17,213
- Horse people.

198
00:11:17,215 --> 00:11:19,315
- Mm-hmm.
- How... how long have I...

199
00:11:19,317 --> 00:11:23,219
- three weeks.
Your injuries were severe.

200
00:11:23,221 --> 00:11:26,456
Your friends were called away,
but they left that for you.

201
00:11:29,193 --> 00:11:31,428
We can start physical therapy
in the morning.

202
00:11:50,281 --> 00:11:51,881
<i>- "Dear Q,</i>

203
00:11:51,883 --> 00:11:53,450
<i>"we buried Alice today
in the gardens,</i>

204
00:11:53,452 --> 00:11:55,385
<i>"where she'll
always be close by.</i>

205
00:11:55,387 --> 00:11:59,155
<i>"We left a box of her things,
if you ever wake up.</i>

206
00:11:59,157 --> 00:12:01,291
<i>"Please wake up.</i>

207
00:12:01,293 --> 00:12:04,728
<i>Your benevolent overlord,
high king Eliot."</i>

208
00:12:17,408 --> 00:12:19,943
Hey.

209
00:12:22,214 --> 00:12:26,282
- Margo sent me here
to get my hands checked out.

210
00:12:26,284 --> 00:12:30,053
Look...

211
00:12:30,055 --> 00:12:31,454
It sucks about Alice.

212
00:12:31,456 --> 00:12:33,923
- "Sucks"?

213
00:12:33,925 --> 00:12:35,325
That's the best that you can do?

214
00:12:35,327 --> 00:12:36,993
- I cared about her, too.

215
00:12:36,995 --> 00:12:39,162
- For what, like, ten minutes,
including foreplay?

216
00:12:39,164 --> 00:12:41,097
- Are you mad at me because
I cared too much or too little?

217
00:12:41,099 --> 00:12:43,066
- I'm mad 'cause you fucked up
the one thing that

218
00:12:43,068 --> 00:12:45,435
we were counting on you for.
- You want to blame me?

219
00:12:45,437 --> 00:12:47,170
It was your cacodemon
that killed her.

220
00:12:47,172 --> 00:12:49,439
- That was not Alice.
Alice was gone.

221
00:12:49,441 --> 00:12:52,542
- So you just saved
the day, huh?

222
00:12:52,544 --> 00:12:55,278
- Could we just...

223
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,114
Convalesce from our horrible
injuries separately, please?

224
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:04,187
- Nice to see you, too, man.

225
00:13:11,495 --> 00:13:14,564
- Good day. My name is sawbones.
I'll be examining you.

226
00:13:17,168 --> 00:13:19,068
Ugh!

227
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,070
Those are the most accursed
things I've ever smelled.

228
00:13:21,072 --> 00:13:24,507
They must be removed posthaste.

229
00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:26,142
How did they become cursed?

230
00:13:26,144 --> 00:13:28,011
- Uh...

231
00:13:28,013 --> 00:13:31,080
Some guy, this... this valet type
of dude at Chatwin's torrent.

232
00:13:31,082 --> 00:13:33,349
- The river watcher.
- You know him?

233
00:13:33,351 --> 00:13:35,285
- I'm sorry.
I-i can't help you.

234
00:13:35,287 --> 00:13:36,486
- Dude, just chop 'em off
and give me

235
00:13:36,488 --> 00:13:38,254
some magic wooden shit
like you did Quentin.

236
00:13:38,256 --> 00:13:40,356
- I'm a surgeon.
I can't risk the curse

237
00:13:40,358 --> 00:13:41,558
spreading to my own hands.

238
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,560
The river watcher...

239
00:13:43,562 --> 00:13:46,095
He's mercurial and dangerous.

240
00:13:46,097 --> 00:13:50,533
You erred greatly
in offending him, penny.

241
00:13:52,838 --> 00:13:54,537
- Did you...

242
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:58,608
Are you shitting?

243
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,377
- You're welcome.

244
00:14:04,249 --> 00:14:07,450
What was I saying?

245
00:14:07,452 --> 00:14:09,385
- Me likey.

246
00:14:09,387 --> 00:14:11,521
- You're thinking about
banging yourself, aren't you?

247
00:14:11,523 --> 00:14:12,555
- Shh, shh, shh.

248
00:14:12,557 --> 00:14:14,390
No, no.

249
00:14:14,392 --> 00:14:18,361
Doing your clone is more like
AP-level masturbation.

250
00:14:18,363 --> 00:14:21,197
- Ugh, put on a robe, would you?

251
00:14:26,403 --> 00:14:29,272
- Aww.
- Now, part two...

252
00:14:29,274 --> 00:14:31,574
A variation
on the mind-control work

253
00:14:31,576 --> 00:14:34,210
Mayakovsky hammered us
with first year.

254
00:14:34,212 --> 00:14:37,146
You sleep here, your mind
goes into the golem.

255
00:14:37,148 --> 00:14:38,581
- And the golem
goes to Brakebills,

256
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:40,416
unless, of course, we're wrong
about the fine print

257
00:14:40,418 --> 00:14:43,253
in my contract and he can't
leave Fillory either.

258
00:14:43,255 --> 00:14:45,488
- Yeah, totally possible
he touches a button

259
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:48,291
and just explodes.

260
00:14:48,293 --> 00:14:51,194
Only one way to find out.

261
00:14:57,401 --> 00:14:59,068
- Richard's alumni key.

262
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,204
It gets you past the wards
at Brakebills.

263
00:15:01,206 --> 00:15:02,472
- I was expelled.

264
00:15:02,474 --> 00:15:04,407
Alarm bells will go off
the second I pop in.

265
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:05,608
- I didn't go to school there.

266
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:07,510
I mean, how am I supposed
to find this book?

267
00:15:07,512 --> 00:15:10,380
"Best bitches"?

268
00:15:10,382 --> 00:15:12,348
It's the only one
the bodega had.

269
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:36,572
<i>Okay, bitch, say something.</i>

270
00:15:39,176 --> 00:15:44,147
- You seeing this?
- Head down this row.

271
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:46,683
Wait. Yeah, that room
on your left.

272
00:15:46,685 --> 00:15:48,518
<i>It's got an anti-decay charm
on it.</i>

273
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,687
<i>It's where they keep
the good shit.</i>

274
00:15:56,627 --> 00:15:59,495
<i>- Got it.</i>
- What?

275
00:15:59,497 --> 00:16:04,300
Wait, let me see.
Hold it up.

276
00:16:04,302 --> 00:16:07,136
Wait, flip it to the back.

277
00:16:07,138 --> 00:16:10,406
Damn it.
It's like a library lojack.

278
00:16:10,408 --> 00:16:11,741
It'll go off if you try
to take the book

279
00:16:11,743 --> 00:16:13,443
outside the Brakebills wards.

280
00:16:13,445 --> 00:16:15,378
<i>- I mean, this will take hours
to copy.</i>

281
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,679
<i>Someone's gonna notice me.</i>

282
00:16:16,681 --> 00:16:20,516
- Well, not if you know
the right place to hide.

283
00:16:29,394 --> 00:16:32,729
- Okay.
Didn't explode so far.

284
00:16:34,498 --> 00:16:36,733
Why does everything smell
so great?

285
00:16:36,735 --> 00:16:39,769
- Because your doppelganger
hasn't met cocaine yet.

286
00:16:39,771 --> 00:16:44,440
Todd! Todd! Todd!
Todd! Todd! Todd!

287
00:16:44,442 --> 00:16:47,343
- Why is everyone
cheering for...

288
00:16:47,345 --> 00:16:50,313
Todd?
- Oh, hey.

289
00:16:50,315 --> 00:16:52,682
You guys!

290
00:16:52,684 --> 00:16:54,417
- You made a lot
of friends, huh?

291
00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:55,785
- I heard you guys were dead.

292
00:16:55,787 --> 00:16:59,689
So I threw this massive rager
in your honor.

293
00:16:59,691 --> 00:17:02,291
- The fact that you just
called it a rager sickens me.

294
00:17:02,293 --> 00:17:05,561
- Thing is, it went great,

295
00:17:05,563 --> 00:17:09,399
and everyone had so much fun
that I kind of...

296
00:17:09,401 --> 00:17:11,034
- Became the new me.

297
00:17:14,205 --> 00:17:16,739
- Todd, answer truthfully.

298
00:17:16,741 --> 00:17:18,541
Are you wearing my vest?

299
00:17:18,543 --> 00:17:23,279
- I am wearing your vest.

300
00:17:23,281 --> 00:17:24,714
- Keep it.

301
00:17:24,716 --> 00:17:27,650
New plan...
I give up on Fillory

302
00:17:27,652 --> 00:17:30,386
and dedicate myself completely
to destroying Todd.

303
00:17:30,388 --> 00:17:33,322
- Oh, it's just Todd.
- "Just Todd"?

304
00:17:33,324 --> 00:17:35,758
He's usurping me.
My entire kingdom is at stake.

305
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,661
- Your actual kingdom
is actually at stake.

306
00:17:38,663 --> 00:17:40,363
- There are some things
more important

307
00:17:40,365 --> 00:17:41,531
than saving an entire world.

308
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:43,066
- Okay, I'm gonna go out
on a limb

309
00:17:43,068 --> 00:17:46,069
and say this isn't really
about Todd.

310
00:17:48,605 --> 00:17:50,673
- You don't say, Margo.

311
00:17:50,675 --> 00:17:53,409
- No killing Todd.

312
00:17:55,312 --> 00:17:56,746
Fucking Todd.

313
00:18:31,748 --> 00:18:33,749
- is this a bad time?

314
00:18:36,653 --> 00:18:38,688
Come sit over here.

315
00:18:41,525 --> 00:18:44,827
- I saw a-a... Strange woman.

316
00:18:44,829 --> 00:18:48,431
She's... Pale and had...

317
00:18:48,433 --> 00:18:50,299
Horn things.

318
00:18:50,301 --> 00:18:52,668
- You've seen the white lady.

319
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,670
- I'm sorry.
"White lady?"

320
00:18:54,672 --> 00:18:56,873
- You are fortunate
she offered herself

321
00:18:56,875 --> 00:18:58,541
to some centaur's sight

322
00:18:58,543 --> 00:19:00,743
while you happened
to be watching.

323
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:10,386
- Is that...
- Mm, skin.

324
00:19:10,388 --> 00:19:13,156
It won't feel,
but it might help you forget

325
00:19:13,158 --> 00:19:14,657
what's underneath.

326
00:19:33,177 --> 00:19:34,677
Get up, Coldwater!

327
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:36,345
- What... what happened?

328
00:19:36,347 --> 00:19:38,548
- My hands tried to kill me,
so I broke my own arms.

329
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,650
Look, forget all the mean shit
I said to you earlier.

330
00:19:40,652 --> 00:19:43,553
The bronies can't fix me.
I need your help.

331
00:19:43,555 --> 00:19:44,787
- Okay, I guess.

332
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:48,491
- First things first...
Find an ax.

333
00:19:52,796 --> 00:19:54,863
- Are you sure about this?

334
00:19:54,865 --> 00:19:56,999
- Do you know how strong
booze has to be

335
00:19:57,001 --> 00:19:59,568
to get a horse drunk?

336
00:20:01,438 --> 00:20:03,806
I c... I ca...
I can't feel my face,

337
00:20:03,808 --> 00:20:06,074
much less my face...

338
00:20:06,076 --> 00:20:09,978
I mean hands.

339
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,180
Just do it.

340
00:20:11,182 --> 00:20:14,483
- I'm going to.
Jeez.

341
00:20:17,988 --> 00:20:18,987
Nope.

342
00:20:18,989 --> 00:20:21,089
- Damn it, Quentin!

343
00:20:21,091 --> 00:20:22,991
- Sorry, I just... I panicked.
I don't love blood.

344
00:20:22,993 --> 00:20:24,526
- Who loves blood?

345
00:20:24,528 --> 00:20:27,029
I'm not gonna feel anything,
so fucking go!

346
00:20:27,031 --> 00:20:28,597
- I don't think I can do this.
- Oh, my god!

347
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:30,165
I knew I fucking couldn't
count on you!

348
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:33,569
You are so fucking pathetic,
you... you... you floppy-haired,

349
00:20:33,571 --> 00:20:35,537
limp dicked dork.

350
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:38,040
Fucking... no wonder Alice
couldn't get off on you.

351
00:20:38,042 --> 00:20:39,875
You have no fuck... aah!
- Aah!

352
00:20:39,877 --> 00:20:41,476
- Oh, I fucking feel it!
- Okay, okay!

353
00:20:41,478 --> 00:20:43,846
- Oh, what did you do?
- I can fix it! I can fix it!

354
00:20:55,159 --> 00:20:56,892
- Oh, I wouldn't.

355
00:20:56,894 --> 00:20:58,527
Todd made that.
It's vile.

356
00:21:04,067 --> 00:21:07,202
Here.

357
00:21:09,173 --> 00:21:11,874
Mmm.
Delicious.

358
00:21:13,042 --> 00:21:15,110
- I'm Eliot.
- Javier.

359
00:21:15,112 --> 00:21:17,579
- You're a first-year?

360
00:21:17,581 --> 00:21:19,014
- Second-year.

361
00:21:19,016 --> 00:21:21,183
<i>Universidad De Asombro</i> in Spain.

362
00:21:21,185 --> 00:21:23,085
I'm here
for the welters tournament.

363
00:21:23,087 --> 00:21:24,286
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

364
00:21:24,288 --> 00:21:26,221
- I would make a joke
about ball handling,

365
00:21:26,223 --> 00:21:29,324
but I'm deadly serious
about ball handling.

366
00:21:29,326 --> 00:21:31,994
- Me too.
- Mm.

367
00:21:31,996 --> 00:21:33,929
Listen, Javier, I could
keep this up all night...

368
00:21:33,931 --> 00:21:36,265
- So could I.
- But I have to reclaim my title

369
00:21:36,267 --> 00:21:37,633
as the life of this
and every party

370
00:21:37,635 --> 00:21:39,134
by making a drink so perfect...

371
00:21:39,136 --> 00:21:43,272
- it seems like you need
to relax.

372
00:21:43,274 --> 00:21:45,240
- I'm married...

373
00:21:45,242 --> 00:21:46,508
To a woman.

374
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,143
- I have a boyfriend.

375
00:21:48,145 --> 00:21:50,646
But he's on another
continent, so...

376
00:21:50,648 --> 00:21:53,148
It doesn't count.

377
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:55,918
And where is your wife?

378
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,185
- On another planet.

379
00:21:57,187 --> 00:22:00,255
Definitely doesn't count.

380
00:22:11,335 --> 00:22:14,102
- Ahh.
It's working.

381
00:22:14,104 --> 00:22:15,270
<i>- Â¿QuÃ©?</i>

382
00:22:15,272 --> 00:22:16,672
- Nothing.
Back at it.

383
00:22:21,645 --> 00:22:23,312
Eliot?

384
00:22:23,314 --> 00:22:26,648
Hey. You were talking
in your sleep.

385
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,383
- What... what did you do?

386
00:22:28,385 --> 00:22:32,254
- I'm sorry. I get a little bit
enthusiastic sometimes.

387
00:22:32,256 --> 00:22:33,322
I'll be gentle.

388
00:22:33,324 --> 00:22:35,023
- You've been in bed all day.

389
00:22:35,025 --> 00:22:36,725
I came to check on you.

390
00:22:36,727 --> 00:22:39,728
- I'm fine.
I'm f-f-fine.

391
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:42,364
- Uh, are you sure
you still want...

392
00:22:42,366 --> 00:22:43,999
- uh, i-i do.

393
00:22:44,001 --> 00:22:45,167
- What?
- I do...

394
00:22:45,169 --> 00:22:47,602
Want to tell you I'm sorry.

395
00:22:47,604 --> 00:22:50,105
I'm so sorry.
- For what?

396
00:22:50,107 --> 00:22:51,239
- Um...

397
00:22:51,241 --> 00:22:53,342
- I'm gonna go.

398
00:22:53,344 --> 00:22:55,277
- Um...

399
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:57,412
No, no. No, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

400
00:22:57,414 --> 00:22:59,414
I-i absolutely want
to have sex right now.

401
00:22:59,416 --> 00:23:02,150
- You do?

402
00:23:02,152 --> 00:23:04,619
- Yeah.

403
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,160
Ah...

404
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,731
This is interesting.

405
00:23:15,733 --> 00:23:17,666
Do you want me to stop?

406
00:23:17,668 --> 00:23:20,369
- Uh...

407
00:23:43,726 --> 00:23:47,029
- Good morning, Quentin.
- How's penny?

408
00:23:47,031 --> 00:23:50,332
- He lost a lot of blood,
but he'll live.

409
00:23:50,334 --> 00:23:52,267
You're ready
for physical therapy.

410
00:23:52,269 --> 00:23:55,103
Some calisthenics maybe
or core work?

411
00:23:55,105 --> 00:23:57,305
- I had something else
in mind, actually.

412
00:24:32,075 --> 00:24:35,077
- You're exactly as good with
a bow as you are with an ax.

413
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:38,113
Since I was a kid, the beast has
been whispering shit in my ear.

414
00:24:38,115 --> 00:24:40,515
Now that he's dead, the world's
gotten a lot quieter...

415
00:24:40,517 --> 00:24:43,118
Or would be
if not for you out here

416
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,521
thinking low-self-esteem shit.

417
00:24:46,523 --> 00:24:49,491
- I'll re-do my wards.

418
00:24:49,493 --> 00:24:51,726
- There's something
in the Declan text

419
00:24:51,728 --> 00:24:53,829
about making arrows
fly straight.

420
00:24:53,831 --> 00:24:55,197
- Show me.

421
00:24:55,199 --> 00:24:56,531
- If I had middle fingers,

422
00:24:56,533 --> 00:24:58,266
you know what they'd be doing
right now?

423
00:24:58,268 --> 00:25:00,168
Start with popper 31.

424
00:25:06,176 --> 00:25:08,844
- Now cross your index
and ring fingers.

425
00:25:08,846 --> 00:25:12,247
No, under the middle.

426
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:15,150
Now slide the thumb
along the meridian.

427
00:25:15,152 --> 00:25:16,751
Now draw the arrow back.

428
00:25:24,193 --> 00:25:26,294
- Thank you.
- Thank me by shutting up.

429
00:25:26,296 --> 00:25:29,164
- There's a creature
called the white lady.

430
00:25:29,166 --> 00:25:30,565
I saw her yesterday.

431
00:25:30,567 --> 00:25:33,235
She's one of the seven
questing creatures of Fillory.

432
00:25:33,237 --> 00:25:36,438
If you can catch her, she has
to give you whatever you ask.

433
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,473
Plover wrote about her,
called her the winter's Doe.

434
00:25:38,475 --> 00:25:40,575
She lives in the darkling wood.

435
00:25:40,577 --> 00:25:42,177
It's just past
the flying forest.

436
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:45,213
It's not far from here.

437
00:25:45,215 --> 00:25:46,748
We could hunt her together.

438
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,451
- "Let's go hunt
the white lady"?

439
00:25:49,453 --> 00:25:51,920
People like me get shot
for saying shit like that.

440
00:25:51,922 --> 00:25:54,422
- She can give you
your hands back.

441
00:25:54,424 --> 00:25:56,491
- What's in it for you?

442
00:25:56,493 --> 00:25:59,161
- I'm gonna ask her
to bring Alice back to life.

443
00:26:09,204 --> 00:26:12,707
- The river we crossed
was at the edge of it.

444
00:26:12,709 --> 00:26:16,110
So we're in the flying forest.

445
00:26:16,112 --> 00:26:19,213
- What? Shouldn't the trees be,
like, flying and shit?

446
00:26:19,215 --> 00:26:22,917
- Yeah, actually.
Most of them are crepuscular.

447
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:26,120
It means they're active
at dawn and dusk.

448
00:26:26,122 --> 00:26:28,122
- You smell that?

449
00:26:28,124 --> 00:26:29,724
It smells like...

450
00:26:29,726 --> 00:26:32,126
- Good.

451
00:26:32,128 --> 00:26:34,095
What is that?

452
00:26:34,097 --> 00:26:36,130
- I don't know.

453
00:26:36,132 --> 00:26:40,034
I Th... I think I'm...
I'm getting a contact high.

454
00:26:40,036 --> 00:26:42,971
- Yeah. Definitely starting
to feel something.

455
00:26:42,973 --> 00:26:46,841
Flying forest.

456
00:26:48,878 --> 00:26:50,244
- Oh, my god.

457
00:26:50,246 --> 00:26:52,280
The Chatwins were, like, ten
when they came through here.

458
00:26:52,282 --> 00:26:54,215
They must have been blazed
the entire time.

459
00:26:54,217 --> 00:26:56,818
- Super inappropriate.

460
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,286
- Hey, i-i take back
what I said.

461
00:26:58,288 --> 00:27:00,722
I-i fully expect
to see

462
00:27:00,724 --> 00:27:02,824
a tree flapping around
at any second.

463
00:27:02,826 --> 00:27:05,093
- Listen, Quincy,
if we get a tree or...

464
00:27:05,095 --> 00:27:07,829
- did you just call me Quincy?

465
00:27:10,032 --> 00:27:13,134
- Is... is that not
your name?

466
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,940
Dude...

467
00:27:18,942 --> 00:27:20,875
Dude, what the fuck?

468
00:27:20,877 --> 00:27:22,844
Get away from my mouth, man.
- It's my mouth.

469
00:27:22,846 --> 00:27:24,278
- Uh...
- No, it's not.

470
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,080
- Oh.

471
00:27:26,082 --> 00:27:28,683
Oh, where...
Uh, where...

472
00:27:28,685 --> 00:27:29,917
Where are my stuff touchers?

473
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,185
Aah! Ooh!

474
00:27:31,187 --> 00:27:33,921
What the fuck is going on?

475
00:27:33,923 --> 00:27:37,191
Who the fuck are you?

476
00:27:37,193 --> 00:27:40,061
Who am I?

477
00:27:40,063 --> 00:27:42,163
I have no idea.

478
00:27:42,165 --> 00:27:45,066
Okay.

479
00:27:45,068 --> 00:27:49,203
The beast shit
in the wellspring.

480
00:27:49,205 --> 00:27:51,739
- No. No.
Ember.

481
00:27:51,741 --> 00:27:54,242
Ember shat in the wellspring.

482
00:27:54,244 --> 00:27:56,711
I think he meant well.

483
00:27:56,713 --> 00:27:58,312
He probably didn't know

484
00:27:58,314 --> 00:28:00,982
how hard it would be
to clean out.

485
00:28:00,984 --> 00:28:05,353
- And now magic is failing
on earth...

486
00:28:05,355 --> 00:28:06,988
Because of shit,

487
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:09,190
proving once again
that comedy and tragedy

488
00:28:09,192 --> 00:28:11,959
can coexist
in the same goddamn sentence.

489
00:28:13,996 --> 00:28:17,231
Honestly...

490
00:28:17,233 --> 00:28:19,033
I am in over my head.

491
00:28:19,035 --> 00:28:21,869
I am not even in control
of which world

492
00:28:21,871 --> 00:28:24,138
my body is awake in,
and my sexually aggressive wife,

493
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,074
she could wake me up
at any moment in Fillory.

494
00:28:26,076 --> 00:28:28,242
- Eliot, there are certain
student/teacher boundaries

495
00:28:28,244 --> 00:28:30,311
which I'd prefer not to cross.

496
00:28:30,313 --> 00:28:32,180
- So what am I supposed
to do, Henry?

497
00:28:32,182 --> 00:28:33,981
- What did you think
was going to happen

498
00:28:33,983 --> 00:28:36,884
when you dove headfirst
into another world?

499
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:45,059
- I thought I'd die.

500
00:28:45,061 --> 00:28:47,095
- But you didn't.

501
00:28:47,097 --> 00:28:49,897
Now you have two lives.

502
00:28:49,899 --> 00:28:51,132
You're trying to live both.

503
00:28:51,134 --> 00:28:53,267
- Yes.
- Yes, but you can't.

504
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:55,136
That's stupid.

505
00:28:55,138 --> 00:28:56,938
You can let it tear you in half

506
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,273
or pick one.

507
00:28:59,275 --> 00:29:01,109
- I can never leave Fillory.

508
00:29:01,111 --> 00:29:03,111
- The choice is easy.

509
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,181
- I am...

510
00:29:07,183 --> 00:29:09,283
Ill-equipped to be a king.

511
00:29:09,285 --> 00:29:11,886
- I am no better equipped
to teach one.

512
00:29:11,888 --> 00:29:15,957
Being an adult is recognizing
your responsibilities.

513
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:19,861
A bunch of my students went
and conquered another world.

514
00:29:19,863 --> 00:29:21,796
- They more, like,
gave it to us.

515
00:29:21,798 --> 00:29:24,065
- Either way,
it doesn't look great for me.

516
00:29:24,067 --> 00:29:27,001
It reeks of earth privilege.

517
00:29:27,003 --> 00:29:29,237
The very least I can do is...

518
00:29:29,239 --> 00:29:30,838
Is to help you rule it.

519
00:29:33,308 --> 00:29:35,143
- What do you have in mind?

520
00:29:35,145 --> 00:29:37,445
- Bring in
the best minds we can...

521
00:29:37,447 --> 00:29:39,981
Historians, politicians,

522
00:29:39,983 --> 00:29:43,885
shamans, military leaders.

523
00:29:43,887 --> 00:29:48,289
Hmm.
Your thesis project is...

524
00:29:48,291 --> 00:29:51,959
"How to save
an entire goddamn world."

525
00:30:01,303 --> 00:30:04,972
- Right or left?

526
00:30:04,974 --> 00:30:08,276
- Right seems to be
the popular direction.

527
00:30:13,315 --> 00:30:14,916
- I must be an adventurer.

528
00:30:14,918 --> 00:30:17,084
No, you're not.

529
00:30:17,086 --> 00:30:19,053
- What?
I have a bow and arrow

530
00:30:19,055 --> 00:30:22,990
and a cool questing outfit
and a manservant.

531
00:30:22,992 --> 00:30:26,160
- Oh-ho-ho, you did not
just say that, white boy.

532
00:30:26,162 --> 00:30:30,298
Besides, what kind of servant
has no fucking hands?

533
00:30:34,336 --> 00:30:37,405
- Right or left?

534
00:30:37,407 --> 00:30:39,907
- Right seems to be
the popular direction.

535
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:48,182
Julia?

536
00:30:49,985 --> 00:30:51,485
What the hell
are you doing here?

537
00:30:51,487 --> 00:30:53,354
- Look, I can explain.
- No.

538
00:30:53,356 --> 00:30:55,356
After you jumped in and screwed
everything up with penny,

539
00:30:55,358 --> 00:30:58,326
Alice died killing
your little friend Martin.

540
00:30:58,328 --> 00:31:01,162
Then Quentin was almost
ripped in half.

541
00:31:01,164 --> 00:31:03,497
And you have the balls
to come here.

542
00:31:03,499 --> 00:31:05,066
- Look, if you guys
had trusted me,

543
00:31:05,068 --> 00:31:06,500
both Reynard and the beast
would be dead.

544
00:31:06,502 --> 00:31:08,336
None of that
would have happened.

545
00:31:08,338 --> 00:31:10,271
- Quentin should have left you
in your little hedge hole,

546
00:31:10,273 --> 00:31:12,506
trading rim jobs for spells.

547
00:31:12,508 --> 00:31:15,309
- You actually think because
you go to this bullshit school

548
00:31:15,311 --> 00:31:17,011
that you're better than me.

549
00:31:17,013 --> 00:31:19,914
- I think I didn't get
my friends killed.

550
00:31:19,916 --> 00:31:21,949
- You don't have friends.

551
00:31:21,951 --> 00:31:24,118
You have people
that are so afraid of you,

552
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,454
they'd rather be on your side.

553
00:31:26,456 --> 00:31:30,424
There's a difference.

554
00:31:30,426 --> 00:31:33,160
- Well...

555
00:31:33,162 --> 00:31:36,030
And you have no one.

556
00:31:36,032 --> 00:31:37,932
And you deserve no one.

557
00:31:37,934 --> 00:31:39,300
- Look,
I don't expect you to care

558
00:31:39,302 --> 00:31:41,135
'cause this doesn't directly
affect your hair

559
00:31:41,137 --> 00:31:44,105
or your social life,
but since you let Reynard free,

560
00:31:44,107 --> 00:31:46,040
he has murdered
over a dozen women,

561
00:31:46,042 --> 00:31:48,309
and this book might be
my last shot at killing him.

562
00:32:01,189 --> 00:32:03,157
- The book's blank.

563
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:06,127
Put yours in the box
and wait for them to mate.

564
00:32:06,129 --> 00:32:09,497
The baby should be a pretty
decent xerox of the original.

565
00:32:30,285 --> 00:32:33,153
- You know what this is?

566
00:32:33,155 --> 00:32:35,155
Ooh, this is a girl's.

567
00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:41,428
What if I'm supposed to be
rescuing her?

568
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:44,497
- Ooh, or what if
you're a stalker?

569
00:32:44,499 --> 00:32:46,499
- Right or left?

570
00:32:49,236 --> 00:32:52,505
- Right seems to be
the popular direction.

571
00:32:52,507 --> 00:32:54,975
- Wait, no.

572
00:32:54,977 --> 00:32:57,510
If I'm supposed
to find her, I...

573
00:32:57,512 --> 00:33:00,513
I have to look
where no one else is searching.

574
00:33:00,515 --> 00:33:02,515
- What?

575
00:33:15,496 --> 00:33:18,298
- Penny.

576
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,201
Douche bag.

577
00:33:23,704 --> 00:33:26,740
The effect of the weed forest
is wearing off.

578
00:33:30,177 --> 00:33:31,745
- Oh, my god.

579
00:33:35,283 --> 00:33:38,251
It's Alice. Uh...

580
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,788
- Quentin, look, I...

581
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:45,625
I know how you feel, man.

582
00:33:45,627 --> 00:33:49,763
Before, when your wards
were slipping, I...

583
00:33:49,765 --> 00:33:52,298
I know.

584
00:33:54,468 --> 00:33:57,570
- I can't.
- No, hey, no, no. Listen.

585
00:33:57,572 --> 00:34:00,273
You... you can't...

586
00:34:00,275 --> 00:34:03,043
You can't puss out right now.

587
00:34:03,045 --> 00:34:05,512
Think about Alice.
She needs you, man.

588
00:34:07,581 --> 00:34:09,749
I need you.

589
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,227
- Hey.

590
00:34:21,229 --> 00:34:22,595
- Hey.

591
00:34:22,597 --> 00:34:24,764
- So I've been thinking.

592
00:34:24,766 --> 00:34:28,735
Is 100 feet really tall enough
for Alice's memorial?

593
00:34:28,737 --> 00:34:31,704
- We weren't her friends,
remember?

594
00:34:38,312 --> 00:34:41,748
- We owe it to her...

595
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:44,517
Because we weren't her friends.

596
00:34:48,622 --> 00:34:51,357
- We don't have the money.

597
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,294
- We're magicians.

598
00:34:54,296 --> 00:34:56,629
Let's build it ourselves.

599
00:34:58,532 --> 00:35:01,768
- Look, what Margo said
about me was true.

600
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:05,371
So if... if you want to bail,
now's your chance.

601
00:35:05,373 --> 00:35:08,608
- Well, you do have
questionable judgment.

602
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:11,711
I mean,
we're best bitches, right?

603
00:35:11,713 --> 00:35:13,680
For better or for worse.

604
00:35:13,682 --> 00:35:14,848
- God.

605
00:35:17,618 --> 00:35:19,419
- Wait a minute.

606
00:35:19,421 --> 00:35:21,421
I know why marina
wanted me to find the book.

607
00:35:21,423 --> 00:35:23,756
- Why?
- It's a necromancy spell.

608
00:35:23,758 --> 00:35:27,560
- As in bring back to life?

609
00:35:27,562 --> 00:35:29,295
No, no fucking way.

610
00:35:29,297 --> 00:35:31,664
- Kady...
- She killed my mother.

611
00:35:31,666 --> 00:35:33,666
- Look, the effects
are unstable.

612
00:35:33,668 --> 00:35:36,836
It'll only last a few minutes,
and then she goes away again.

613
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:38,471
- Fine.

614
00:35:40,674 --> 00:35:42,609
Fine.
Let's defrost the bitch.

615
00:35:46,914 --> 00:35:51,317
It says the last ingredient
is the book itself.

616
00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:53,319
- Then we got one chance.

617
00:36:06,668 --> 00:36:09,602
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

618
00:36:09,604 --> 00:36:10,937
It's okay.
It's okay.

619
00:36:10,939 --> 00:36:12,839
My skin is so cold.

620
00:36:12,841 --> 00:36:14,741
- It's okay. Look at me, please.
- You... you brought me back...

621
00:36:14,743 --> 00:36:16,476
- you had a message
you wanted to tell me.

622
00:36:16,478 --> 00:36:18,711
- I'm gonna die.
- We don't have that much time.

623
00:36:18,713 --> 00:36:20,713
- You don't understand.
You don't know where I was.

624
00:36:20,715 --> 00:36:22,849
I don't want to go back there.
I don't want to go back there.

625
00:36:22,851 --> 00:36:24,651
- Marina, your clock
is running out, okay?

626
00:36:24,653 --> 00:36:26,686
Please, you are the strongest
person that I have ever met.

627
00:36:26,688 --> 00:36:28,454
I need you to pull it
together now,

628
00:36:28,456 --> 00:36:29,856
and I need you to tell me.

629
00:36:29,858 --> 00:36:33,560
- I need you to tell me
about the thing that killed you.

630
00:36:36,531 --> 00:36:38,198
You can stop him, Julia.

631
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,501
It is possible,
but you need to do it.

632
00:36:41,503 --> 00:36:43,903
You need to do it.
- Okay, what?

633
00:36:43,905 --> 00:36:45,605
What do I need to do?

634
00:36:45,607 --> 00:36:48,608
- There was... A girl.

635
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:52,745
40 years ago,
she banished Reynard from earth.

636
00:36:52,747 --> 00:36:54,881
That's where he was
until you summoned him.

637
00:36:54,883 --> 00:36:57,784
That's where he was
until you brought him back.

638
00:36:57,786 --> 00:37:00,653
I'm sorr... I'm sorry.

639
00:37:20,841 --> 00:37:22,842
- Shh.

640
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,448
- Hi.

641
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,951
Don't run.

642
00:38:04,953 --> 00:38:06,986
Are you gonna?

643
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:11,057
- What's the deal?

644
00:38:11,059 --> 00:38:15,028
- I don't know.
She's kind of ignoring me.

645
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:17,530
- Yo, white lady, we caught you.

646
00:38:17,532 --> 00:38:21,501
- Hey, show some respect.

647
00:38:21,503 --> 00:38:25,438
- Pardon me...
Miss lady?

648
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,307
- It hurts.

649
00:38:27,309 --> 00:38:29,976
- Uh, sorry.
Uh...

650
00:38:29,978 --> 00:38:31,477
- Why have you come?

651
00:38:31,479 --> 00:38:32,812
- That's my arrow.

652
00:38:32,814 --> 00:38:34,414
You have to give me what I ask.

653
00:38:34,416 --> 00:38:37,750
- Obviously, you turd.

654
00:38:44,058 --> 00:38:46,326
Look at you.

655
00:38:46,328 --> 00:38:50,096
Someone's been rebuilt...

656
00:38:50,098 --> 00:38:52,332
And so cleverly.

657
00:38:58,439 --> 00:39:00,440
Mm.

658
00:39:01,842 --> 00:39:03,843
Feel that?

659
00:39:05,446 --> 00:39:07,447
- Could you not?

660
00:39:07,449 --> 00:39:09,482
- Here's a riddle.

661
00:39:09,484 --> 00:39:10,950
How much do you have to lose

662
00:39:10,952 --> 00:39:13,486
before you're no longer
yourself?

663
00:39:13,488 --> 00:39:15,455
- I don't know.
Why don't you tell me?

664
00:39:15,457 --> 00:39:17,490
- What is it, Quentin Coldwater,

665
00:39:17,492 --> 00:39:19,125
that you ache for?

666
00:39:19,127 --> 00:39:21,094
You have a crown

667
00:39:21,096 --> 00:39:24,864
and the power to reshape
the very ether to your whim.

668
00:39:24,866 --> 00:39:28,434
What else could you
possibly want?

669
00:39:28,436 --> 00:39:32,138
- Um, technically speaking,
uh, we both caught you, so...

670
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,374
- Shut up. I'll ask for your
thing with my third wish.

671
00:39:34,376 --> 00:39:37,009
- No.
We each get a wish,

672
00:39:37,011 --> 00:39:39,846
and then we have one
mutually agreeable third wish.

673
00:39:39,848 --> 00:39:41,881
- You can each have one wish,
or you can fuck off.

674
00:39:41,883 --> 00:39:43,082
- Okay.

675
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,554
Alice Quinn...

676
00:39:49,923 --> 00:39:51,824
Bring her back to life...

677
00:39:53,794 --> 00:39:56,963
Please.

678
00:39:56,965 --> 00:39:59,465
- I can't.

679
00:39:59,467 --> 00:40:01,601
- What do you mean you can't?

680
00:40:01,603 --> 00:40:04,904
You are not the only magical
creature in this fucking forest.

681
00:40:04,906 --> 00:40:06,406
- True.

682
00:40:06,408 --> 00:40:08,508
And we all have limits.

683
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:10,610
We can give you anything.

684
00:40:10,612 --> 00:40:13,045
But we cannot Pierce that veil.

685
00:40:13,047 --> 00:40:15,047
Alice is gone.

686
00:40:23,624 --> 00:40:27,093
- My turn.

687
00:40:27,095 --> 00:40:28,961
I want my hands back.

688
00:40:28,963 --> 00:40:30,430
- That I can do.

689
00:40:36,971 --> 00:40:40,973
No!

690
00:40:42,877 --> 00:40:44,076
- What did you do to him?

691
00:40:44,078 --> 00:40:46,212
- That screaming was irritating.

692
00:40:46,214 --> 00:40:48,481
He'll wake when he's healed.

693
00:40:48,483 --> 00:40:51,517
Now, I can't nap
until I've granted your wish.

694
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:53,853
- I'd like to be happy.
Could you do that?

695
00:40:53,855 --> 00:40:56,222
- I can do wonders.

696
00:40:56,224 --> 00:40:58,524
But you should know...

697
00:40:58,526 --> 00:41:02,962
There's nothing I can give you
that will soothe your shade.

698
00:41:02,964 --> 00:41:05,998
There's only
what I can take away.

699
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,501
- You'd take away
my memories of Alice?

700
00:41:08,503 --> 00:41:11,204
- Yes.
I would free you completely.

701
00:41:14,174 --> 00:41:16,709
- No.

702
00:41:16,711 --> 00:41:20,480
- You are wiser than you appear.

703
00:41:20,482 --> 00:41:23,649
You would find your way
back to sadness,

704
00:41:23,651 --> 00:41:26,018
no matter how far
you run from it.

705
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,554
- Well, that's comforting.

706
00:41:28,556 --> 00:41:32,225
- Is there nothing else
you desire?

707
00:41:32,227 --> 00:41:36,128
- Everything I've ever wanted,
I've got.

708
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:40,066
Magic is real, and it can fix
anything except what I need.

709
00:41:41,702 --> 00:41:44,203
I loved a girl.

710
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:50,142
My entire life...
I've dreamed of Fillory,

711
00:41:50,144 --> 00:41:53,579
that I would be like
Martin Chatwin.

712
00:41:53,581 --> 00:41:55,948
I'd find a way
to stay here forever.

713
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:07,593
Send me home.
