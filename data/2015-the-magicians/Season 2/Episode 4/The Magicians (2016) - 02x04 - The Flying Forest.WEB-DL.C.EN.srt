1
00:00:00,937 --> 00:00:03,432
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:05,256 --> 00:00:07,537
- No, no, no.
- Don't you fucking touch her.

3
00:00:07,572 --> 00:00:09,372
Fine, I'll take you first.

4
00:00:09,407 --> 00:00:11,073
No! No.

5
00:00:13,678 --> 00:00:15,444
Now!

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,411
- Julia.
- Move!

7
00:00:17,531 --> 00:00:18,948
Wait.

8
00:00:18,983 --> 00:00:22,045
I had Reynard. I had The Beast.

9
00:00:22,165 --> 00:00:23,906
Man, fuck this. We're out.

10
00:00:26,377 --> 00:00:28,244
The chain was the only thing
keeping my hand from...

11
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:31,447
Sorry. Not my problem.

12
00:00:31,482 --> 00:00:33,015
Do you know what a Niffin is?

13
00:00:33,051 --> 00:00:34,283
It's when too much runs through you,

14
00:00:34,318 --> 00:00:35,384
consumes you.

15
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:37,286
Only the magic is left.

16
00:00:37,321 --> 00:00:42,124
Hard to cast when you're sliced in two.

17
00:00:44,529 --> 00:00:46,028
What is she doing?

18
00:00:46,064 --> 00:00:48,130
She can't. She'll Niffin out.

19
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:49,532
Alice, stop.

20
00:00:52,036 --> 00:00:56,072
Let's finally finish this.

21
00:00:56,107 --> 00:00:58,074
He did it on purpose.

22
00:01:02,547 --> 00:01:06,415
Alice, don't.

23
00:01:43,988 --> 00:01:47,156
- Five surgeries.
- He'll recover.

24
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:49,425
I know we're being serious right now,

25
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,428
but that surgeon has the biggest dick.

26
00:01:57,668 --> 00:02:00,669
Eliot, it's time to go.

27
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,273
Our kingdom awaits.

28
00:02:12,717 --> 00:02:15,751
With The Beast dead, there's
a power vacuum in Fillory.

29
00:02:15,787 --> 00:02:17,353
Power vacuum?

30
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:20,055
Hello? High King and Queen right here.

31
00:02:20,091 --> 00:02:23,192
We, of course, recognize your
rule, but others...

32
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:24,994
Everyone assumes you'll be dead soon...

33
00:02:25,029 --> 00:02:28,764
or you'll run away or vanish or go mad.

34
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,366
There are stirrings of rebellion

35
00:02:30,401 --> 00:02:32,268
in the Southern Orchard,
the Outer Islands,

36
00:02:32,303 --> 00:02:34,203
refusal to pay the Crown's taxes.

37
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:36,438
You know who loves paying taxes?

38
00:02:36,474 --> 00:02:38,340
People with broken legs.

39
00:02:40,211 --> 00:02:41,577
Abigail would remind you

40
00:02:41,612 --> 00:02:43,712
that money cannot fill the Wellspring.

41
00:02:43,748 --> 00:02:45,381
Without it, Fillory withers.

42
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:47,416
Okay, well, we talked about this.

43
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:49,385
When someone drops a log
at a public pool,

44
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,587
you just send a kid with a net
to fish it out.

45
00:02:51,622 --> 00:02:55,558
The befouling
was substantial, Your Majesty.

46
00:02:55,593 --> 00:02:57,493
We've employed
several filtration systems,

47
00:02:57,528 --> 00:03:00,196
but the Wellspring
isn't recovering fast enough.

48
00:03:00,231 --> 00:03:02,498
If there was a royal appeal
to Ember himself...

49
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:04,366
Okay, we can't find him.

50
00:03:04,402 --> 00:03:07,236
He's not in his temple
or his filthy sex cave.

51
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:08,671
We need to devote more resources.

52
00:03:08,706 --> 00:03:10,105
We're going to build a monument

53
00:03:10,141 --> 00:03:11,540
to our fallen queen...

54
00:03:11,576 --> 00:03:14,176
a statue, I think...

55
00:03:14,212 --> 00:03:15,578
100 feet high.

56
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:17,112
Do you know what that would cost?

57
00:03:17,148 --> 00:03:19,114
I don't care how much it costs.

58
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,717
I want designs drawn up and funds...

59
00:03:21,752 --> 00:03:25,120
funded immediately.

60
00:03:25,156 --> 00:03:28,557
Can you give us a moment?

61
00:03:28,593 --> 00:03:31,560
I said get the fuck out.

62
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,635
So that's the plan, huh...

63
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,104
blow all our cash on sappy nonsense,

64
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,272
bankrupt the kingdom?

65
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:44,807
We have to do something.

66
00:03:44,842 --> 00:03:46,175
Alice was our friend.

67
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,677
No. She wasn't.

68
00:03:48,713 --> 00:03:51,814
Alice was a package deal.
She came with Quentin.

69
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:53,849
Somebody skipped her colonic
this morning.

70
00:03:53,885 --> 00:03:56,719
For whatever stupid reason,

71
00:03:56,754 --> 00:04:00,289
you're the High King of an entire land.

72
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:02,191
You have to be responsible, Eliot.

73
00:04:02,226 --> 00:04:03,759
Since when are you Fillory Clinton?

74
00:04:03,794 --> 00:04:06,095
Since I'm me.

75
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,765
My crown is just as heavy as yours.

76
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,434
You can leave whenever you feel like it.

77
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,169
You can go back to Brakebills.

78
00:04:14,205 --> 00:04:17,206
You can do whatever you goddamn want.

79
00:04:20,411 --> 00:04:22,244
I don't belong here.

80
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,846
I'm not ready to be a king.

81
00:04:23,881 --> 00:04:27,616
I wasn't done being me.

82
00:04:27,652 --> 00:04:29,752
It was so much simpler
when there was just

83
00:04:29,787 --> 00:04:33,489
one giant evil dick trying to kill us.

84
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:36,325
- Now we're just...
- Grown-ups.

85
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,496
How did this happen?

86
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:42,765
I have an idea... to help you.

87
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,701
- Like a loophole?
- Mm-hmm.

88
00:04:50,942 --> 00:04:53,876
You're gonna ironically
abandon me here to go find it.

89
00:04:53,911 --> 00:04:56,611
I'll be back. I promise.

90
00:04:58,482 --> 00:05:00,516
I know you...

91
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:02,318
Will.

93
00:05:32,717 --> 00:05:35,517
Hey.

94
00:05:35,553 --> 00:05:37,560
Kady?

95
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:39,922
Hey.

96
00:05:41,781 --> 00:05:44,549
Kady, come on, I need your help.

97
00:05:46,831 --> 00:05:48,831
Let's go.

98
00:06:12,323 --> 00:06:14,790
You haven't had any other
problems with your casting?

99
00:06:14,825 --> 00:06:16,959
I've had nothing but problems.

100
00:06:16,994 --> 00:06:18,627
I thought it was because of my hands,

101
00:06:18,662 --> 00:06:21,630
but it's getting worse, not better.

102
00:06:21,665 --> 00:06:24,400
Hmm.

103
00:06:24,435 --> 00:06:28,704
I've had a few...
brownouts, you could call them.

104
00:06:28,739 --> 00:06:31,240
I mean, I thought it was
the Xanax, honestly.

105
00:06:31,275 --> 00:06:32,641
How many?

106
00:06:32,676 --> 00:06:35,544
Two a day if I can get them.

107
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:36,979
Oh, you mean the brownouts.

108
00:06:37,014 --> 00:06:39,314
Four or five.

109
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,482
Hmm.

110
00:06:43,888 --> 00:06:45,854
Yes.

111
00:06:54,398 --> 00:06:56,498
What happened?

112
00:06:56,534 --> 00:06:58,400
I'm trying to get back here,
but my aim's off.

113
00:06:58,436 --> 00:07:00,736
Okay, all right, It seems like
more than your aim.

114
00:07:00,771 --> 00:07:02,011
Last three worlds I've been in

115
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:03,806
haven't had any fucking oxygen.

116
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:06,642
My fingers just... they just...
they just keep shorting me out.

117
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:11,947
What happened? Did we kill The Beast?

118
00:07:11,982 --> 00:07:13,949
We did.

119
00:07:15,453 --> 00:07:20,322
But, um, Quentin's pretty banged up.

120
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,925
Alice was hurt a lot worse, Penny.

121
00:07:25,496 --> 00:07:28,363
She... she died.

122
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:40,642
- Budget?
- Citizen petitions.

123
00:07:40,678 --> 00:07:44,046
I want everyone to stop wanting things.

124
00:07:44,081 --> 00:07:47,883
Great time to ask for something?

125
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:50,018
Your father makes knives for a living

126
00:07:50,054 --> 00:07:51,720
and knows where I sleep, so...

127
00:07:51,755 --> 00:07:53,989
Ask away.

128
00:07:55,993 --> 00:07:59,394
I'm know I'm not precisely the type

129
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,497
you'd most likely choose,

130
00:08:01,532 --> 00:08:05,701
and I wasn't so experienced
when we were first together,

131
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:07,069
but you're so great at it.

132
00:08:07,104 --> 00:08:10,005
You're... you're huge, and it's so good.

133
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,809
And, Eliot, I don't know how
to politely ask you to fuck me.

134
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:17,980
Oh, look, Margo's here.

135
00:08:18,015 --> 00:08:19,781
You remember Lasaro?

136
00:08:19,817 --> 00:08:21,350
That creep who made the Margolem?

137
00:08:21,385 --> 00:08:23,519
I twisted his arms
and/or balls a little,

138
00:08:23,554 --> 00:08:25,587
and he gave up the spell.

139
00:08:25,623 --> 00:08:26,922
Living clay is hard to come by,

140
00:08:26,957 --> 00:08:29,591
but Fogg left his stash so unprotected,

141
00:08:29,627 --> 00:08:31,894
it's like he wanted me to steal it.

142
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:34,563
So I did.

143
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:36,732
We're gonna make another you.

144
00:08:43,107 --> 00:08:44,606
Hey.

145
00:08:44,642 --> 00:08:47,576
Made you a sandwich... half an hour ago.

146
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,545
Then I ate it.

147
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,380
I'm sorry.

148
00:08:51,415 --> 00:08:53,949
It's been a long time
since I've had a hot shower.

149
00:08:53,984 --> 00:08:55,117
How you feeling?

150
00:08:55,152 --> 00:08:57,152
Uh...

151
00:08:57,188 --> 00:08:58,954
Better...

152
00:08:58,989 --> 00:09:01,790
nap, seeing you alive,

153
00:09:01,825 --> 00:09:04,593
magic methadone...

154
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:07,829
methadone.

155
00:09:07,865 --> 00:09:09,631
Thanks...

156
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:12,434
for all of it.

157
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:16,471
So, um, how did you find me?

158
00:09:16,507 --> 00:09:18,774
After asking around a bit,
I heard about a girl

159
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,909
who was doing miracles for a quick fix.

160
00:09:20,945 --> 00:09:23,145
I called it "turning tricks."

161
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,870
You think I'm judging you, I'm not.

162
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:28,452
No. No, I'm judging myself.

163
00:09:28,887 --> 00:09:32,287
You... you saved my life,

164
00:09:32,407 --> 00:09:33,604
and...

165
00:09:35,017 --> 00:09:38,404
you know, I-I thought
it would be okay to run...

166
00:09:39,248 --> 00:09:41,481
if I got the cavalry
and I came back to help you,

167
00:09:41,517 --> 00:09:43,350
but I...

168
00:09:43,385 --> 00:09:47,087
I just ran.

169
00:09:47,122 --> 00:09:49,122
I hid.

170
00:09:49,158 --> 00:09:53,260
Yeah, well, there was nothing
you could have done then.

171
00:09:53,295 --> 00:09:56,997
But you can help me now.

172
00:09:57,032 --> 00:09:59,332
Oh, my God.

173
00:09:59,368 --> 00:10:01,902
- Ju... Julia, is that...
- Marina.

174
00:10:01,937 --> 00:10:04,471
She helped me bait a trap for Reynard.

175
00:10:04,506 --> 00:10:06,982
- He killed her.
- You freeze-dried her corpse?

176
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:08,850
Alonso's Reverse Thermogenesis.

177
00:10:09,011 --> 00:10:11,378
But look...

178
00:10:11,413 --> 00:10:13,947
she left this for a reason...

179
00:10:13,982 --> 00:10:15,148
a message or a code.

180
00:10:15,184 --> 00:10:16,583
I mean, at least I thought that...

181
00:10:16,618 --> 00:10:18,218
No, no. I know exactly what that is.

182
00:10:18,253 --> 00:10:20,120
That's a locator number...

183
00:10:20,155 --> 00:10:23,023
for a book in the library at Brakebills.

184
00:10:38,156 --> 00:10:39,689
Be careful.

185
00:10:39,964 --> 00:10:42,644
That's a long drop for human legs.

186
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:44,160
We would not want to see you get hurt

187
00:10:44,196 --> 00:10:47,530
so soon after being rebuilt.

188
00:10:47,566 --> 00:10:49,566
"Rebuilt"?

189
00:10:53,472 --> 00:10:56,005
It's strange, I know.

190
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:57,173
But you'll get used to it.

191
00:10:57,209 --> 00:10:58,975
Is this a hospital?

192
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:02,278
- Are you... are you a doctor?
- You're at the retreat...

193
00:11:02,314 --> 00:11:04,681
a few hours gallop north of Whitespire.

194
00:11:04,716 --> 00:11:06,983
I was a patient years ago.

195
00:11:07,018 --> 00:11:09,586
The Centaurs saved my life
when no one else could.

196
00:11:09,621 --> 00:11:12,655
Now I try to repay that debt
by serving them as a nurse.

197
00:11:12,691 --> 00:11:15,058
- The Centaurs?
- Mm-hmm.

198
00:11:15,093 --> 00:11:16,493
Horse people.

199
00:11:16,528 --> 00:11:18,595
- Mm-hmm.
- How... how long have I...

200
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:22,499
Three weeks. Your injuries were severe.

201
00:11:22,534 --> 00:11:26,035
Your friends were called away,
but they left that for you.

202
00:11:28,507 --> 00:11:30,773
We can start physical therapy
in the morning.

203
00:11:49,628 --> 00:11:51,094
"Dear Q,

204
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:52,795
"we buried Alice today in the gardens,

205
00:11:52,831 --> 00:11:54,731
"where she'll always be close by.

206
00:11:54,766 --> 00:11:58,434
"We left a box of her things,
if you ever wake up.

207
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,603
"Please wake up.

208
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,073
Your benevolent overlord,
High King Eliot."

209
00:12:16,788 --> 00:12:19,155
Hey.

210
00:12:21,526 --> 00:12:25,595
Margo sent me here
to get my hands checked out.

211
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:29,299
Look...

212
00:12:29,334 --> 00:12:30,800
it sucks about Alice.

213
00:12:30,835 --> 00:12:33,136
"Sucks"?

214
00:12:33,171 --> 00:12:34,604
That's the best that you can do?

215
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,205
I cared about her, too.

216
00:12:36,241 --> 00:12:38,408
For what, like, ten minutes,
including foreplay?

217
00:12:38,443 --> 00:12:40,343
Are you mad at me because
I cared too much or too little?

218
00:12:40,378 --> 00:12:42,312
I'm mad 'cause you fucked up
the one thing that

219
00:12:42,347 --> 00:12:44,781
- we were counting on you for.
- You want to blame me?

220
00:12:44,816 --> 00:12:46,416
It was your cacodemon that killed her.

221
00:12:46,451 --> 00:12:48,785
That was not Alice. Alice was gone.

222
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,088
So you just saved the day, huh?

223
00:12:52,123 --> 00:12:54,557
Could we just...

224
00:12:54,593 --> 00:12:57,594
convalesce from our horrible
injuries separately, please?

225
00:13:01,466 --> 00:13:03,466
Nice to see you, too, man.

226
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:14,143
Good day. My name is Sawbones.
I'll be examining you.

227
00:13:16,448 --> 00:13:18,247
Ugh!

228
00:13:18,283 --> 00:13:20,316
Those are the most accursed
things I've ever smelled.

229
00:13:20,352 --> 00:13:23,853
They must be removed posthaste.

230
00:13:23,888 --> 00:13:25,388
How did they become cursed?

231
00:13:25,423 --> 00:13:27,223
Uh...

232
00:13:27,258 --> 00:13:30,293
Some guy, this... this valet type
of dude at Chatwin's Torrent.

233
00:13:30,328 --> 00:13:32,595
- The River Watcher.
- You know him?

234
00:13:32,631 --> 00:13:34,564
I'm sorry. I-I can't help you.

235
00:13:34,599 --> 00:13:35,832
Dude, just chop 'em off and give me

236
00:13:35,867 --> 00:13:37,533
some magic wooden shit
like you did Quentin.

237
00:13:37,569 --> 00:13:39,669
I'm a surgeon. I can't risk the curse

238
00:13:39,704 --> 00:13:40,903
spreading to my own hands.

239
00:13:40,939 --> 00:13:42,905
The River Watcher...

240
00:13:42,941 --> 00:13:45,308
He's mercurial and dangerous.

241
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:49,879
You erred greatly
in offending him, Penny.

242
00:13:52,217 --> 00:13:53,850
Did you...

243
00:13:53,885 --> 00:13:58,154
Are you shitting?

244
00:13:58,189 --> 00:14:00,690
You're welcome.

245
00:14:03,528 --> 00:14:06,763
What was I saying?

246
00:14:06,798 --> 00:14:08,665
Me likey.

247
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,833
You're thinking about
banging yourself, aren't you?

248
00:14:10,869 --> 00:14:11,901
Shh, shh, shh.

249
00:14:11,936 --> 00:14:13,670
No, no.

250
00:14:13,705 --> 00:14:17,640
Doing your clone is more like
AP-level masturbation.

251
00:14:17,676 --> 00:14:20,443
Ugh, put on a robe, would you?

252
00:14:25,717 --> 00:14:28,551
- Aww.
- Now, part two...

253
00:14:28,586 --> 00:14:30,920
a variation on the mind-control work

254
00:14:30,955 --> 00:14:33,456
Mayakovsky hammered us with first year.

255
00:14:33,491 --> 00:14:36,359
You sleep here, your mind
goes into the golem.

256
00:14:36,394 --> 00:14:37,927
And the golem goes to Brakebills,

257
00:14:37,962 --> 00:14:39,729
unless, of course, we're wrong
about the fine print

258
00:14:39,764 --> 00:14:42,498
in my contract and he can't
leave Fillory either.

259
00:14:42,534 --> 00:14:44,801
Yeah, totally possible
he touches a button

260
00:14:44,836 --> 00:14:47,570
and just explodes.

261
00:14:47,605 --> 00:14:50,406
Only one way to find out.

262
00:14:56,715 --> 00:14:58,281
Richard's alumni key.

263
00:14:58,316 --> 00:15:00,450
It gets you past the wards
at Brakebills.

264
00:15:00,485 --> 00:15:01,851
I was expelled.

265
00:15:01,886 --> 00:15:03,686
Alarm bells will go off
the second I pop in.

266
00:15:03,722 --> 00:15:04,954
I didn't go to school there.

267
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:06,823
I mean, how am I supposed
to find this book?

268
00:15:06,858 --> 00:15:09,659
"Best bitches"?

269
00:15:09,694 --> 00:15:11,627
It's the only one the bodega had.

270
00:15:32,817 --> 00:15:35,918
Okay, bitch, say something.

271
00:15:38,423 --> 00:15:43,359
- You seeing this?
- Head down this row.

272
00:15:43,394 --> 00:15:46,028
Wait. Yeah, that room on your left.

273
00:15:46,064 --> 00:15:47,830
It's got an anti-decay charm on it.

274
00:15:47,866 --> 00:15:50,032
It's where they keep the good shit.

275
00:15:56,007 --> 00:15:58,775
- Got it.
- What?

276
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:03,546
Wait, let me see. Hold it up.

277
00:16:03,581 --> 00:16:06,349
Wait, flip it to the back.

278
00:16:06,384 --> 00:16:09,685
Damn it. It's like a library LoJack.

279
00:16:09,721 --> 00:16:11,287
It'll go off if you try to take the book

280
00:16:11,322 --> 00:16:12,722
outside the Brakebills wards.

281
00:16:12,757 --> 00:16:14,624
I mean, this will take hours to copy.

282
00:16:14,659 --> 00:16:16,025
Someone's gonna notice me.

283
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:19,829
Well, not if you know
the right place to hide.

284
00:16:28,673 --> 00:16:32,074
Okay. Didn't explode so far.

285
00:16:33,812 --> 00:16:36,078
Why does everything smell so great?

286
00:16:36,114 --> 00:16:39,315
Because your doppelganger
hasn't met cocaine yet.

287
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:43,719
Todd! Todd! Todd! Todd! Todd! Todd!

288
00:16:43,755 --> 00:16:46,589
Why is everyone cheering for...

289
00:16:46,624 --> 00:16:49,559
- Todd?
- Oh, hey.

290
00:16:49,594 --> 00:16:51,961
You guys!

291
00:16:51,996 --> 00:16:53,663
You made a lot of friends, huh?

292
00:16:53,698 --> 00:16:55,331
I heard you guys were dead.

293
00:16:55,366 --> 00:16:59,001
So I threw this massive rager
in your honor.

294
00:16:59,037 --> 00:17:01,571
The fact that you just
called it a rager sickens me.

295
00:17:01,606 --> 00:17:04,874
Thing is, it went great,

296
00:17:04,909 --> 00:17:08,644
and everyone had so much fun
that I kind of...

297
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,379
Became the new me.

298
00:17:13,451 --> 00:17:16,085
Todd, answer truthfully.

299
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,820
Are you wearing my vest?

300
00:17:17,856 --> 00:17:22,491
I am wearing your vest.

301
00:17:22,527 --> 00:17:24,060
Keep it.

302
00:17:24,095 --> 00:17:26,963
New plan... I give up on Fillory

303
00:17:26,998 --> 00:17:29,632
and dedicate myself completely
to destroying Todd.

304
00:17:29,667 --> 00:17:32,535
- Oh, it's just Todd.
- "Just Todd"?

305
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:35,104
He's usurping me.
My entire kingdom is at stake.

306
00:17:35,139 --> 00:17:37,974
Your actual kingdom
is actually at stake.

307
00:17:38,009 --> 00:17:39,609
There are some things more important

308
00:17:39,644 --> 00:17:40,810
than saving an entire world.

309
00:17:40,845 --> 00:17:42,411
Okay, I'm gonna go out on a limb

310
00:17:42,447 --> 00:17:45,448
and say this isn't really about Todd.

311
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,986
You don't say, Margo.

312
00:17:50,021 --> 00:17:52,655
No killing Todd.

313
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,092
Fucking Todd.

314
00:18:31,095 --> 00:18:33,062
Is this a bad time?

315
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,967
Come sit over here.

316
00:18:40,805 --> 00:18:44,173
I saw a-a... strange woman.

317
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:47,677
She's... pale and had...

318
00:18:47,712 --> 00:18:49,512
horn things.

319
00:18:49,547 --> 00:18:51,981
You've seen the White Lady.

320
00:18:52,016 --> 00:18:53,983
I'm sorry. "White Lady?"

321
00:18:54,018 --> 00:18:56,218
You are fortunate she offered herself

322
00:18:56,254 --> 00:18:57,787
to some Centaur's sight

323
00:18:57,822 --> 00:19:00,056
while you happened to be watching.

324
00:19:05,663 --> 00:19:08,790
- Is that...
- Mm, skin.

325
00:19:09,076 --> 00:19:12,501
It won't feel,
but it might help you forget

326
00:19:12,537 --> 00:19:13,970
what's underneath.

327
00:19:32,294 --> 00:19:33,956
Get up, Coldwater!

328
00:19:33,992 --> 00:19:34,992
What... what happened?

329
00:19:35,025 --> 00:19:37,251
My hands tried to kill me,
so I broke my own arms.

330
00:19:38,227 --> 00:19:39,891
Look, forget all the mean shit
I said to you earlier.

331
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,614
The Bronies can't fix me.
I need your help.

332
00:19:42,388 --> 00:19:43,654
Okay, I guess.

333
00:19:43,689 --> 00:19:47,224
First things first... find an ax.

334
00:19:51,486 --> 00:19:53,354
Are you sure about this?

335
00:19:53,379 --> 00:19:55,513
Do you know how strong booze has to be

336
00:19:55,548 --> 00:19:58,215
to get a horse drunk?

337
00:20:00,086 --> 00:20:02,253
I c... I ca... I can't feel my face,

338
00:20:02,288 --> 00:20:04,589
much less my face...

339
00:20:04,624 --> 00:20:06,406
I mean hands.

340
00:20:08,528 --> 00:20:09,727
Just do it.

341
00:20:09,762 --> 00:20:13,097
I'm going to. Jeez.

342
00:20:16,536 --> 00:20:17,501
Nope.

343
00:20:17,537 --> 00:20:19,604
Damn it, Quentin!

344
00:20:19,639 --> 00:20:21,505
Sorry, I just... I panicked.
I don't love blood.

345
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,140
Who loves blood?

346
00:20:23,176 --> 00:20:25,543
I'm not gonna feel anything,
so fucking go!

347
00:20:25,578 --> 00:20:27,244
- I don't think I can do this.
- Oh, my God!

348
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,679
I knew I fucking couldn't count on you!

349
00:20:28,715 --> 00:20:32,216
You are so fucking pathetic,
you... you... you floppy-haired,

350
00:20:32,251 --> 00:20:34,151
limp dicked dork.

351
00:20:34,187 --> 00:20:36,554
Fucking... no wonder Alice
couldn't get off on you.

352
00:20:36,589 --> 00:20:38,356
- You have no fu... Aah!
- Aah!

353
00:20:38,391 --> 00:20:40,091
- Oh, I fucking feel it!
- Okay, okay!

354
00:20:40,126 --> 00:20:42,293
- Oh, what did you do?
- I can fix it! I can fix it!

355
00:20:53,706 --> 00:20:55,373
Oh, I wouldn't.

356
00:20:55,408 --> 00:20:57,174
Todd made that. It's vile.

357
00:21:02,615 --> 00:21:05,750
Here.

358
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,321
Mmm. Delicious.

359
00:21:11,591 --> 00:21:13,624
- I'm Eliot.
- Javier.

360
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,227
You're a first-year?

361
00:21:16,262 --> 00:21:17,495
Second-year.

362
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,730
Universidad De Asombro in Spain.

363
00:21:19,766 --> 00:21:21,599
I'm here for the Welters tournament.

364
00:21:21,634 --> 00:21:23,034
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

365
00:21:23,069 --> 00:21:24,769
I would make a joke about ball handling,

366
00:21:24,804 --> 00:21:28,072
but I'm deadly serious
about ball handling.

367
00:21:28,107 --> 00:21:30,474
- Me too.
- Mm.

368
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:32,410
Listen, Javier, I could
keep this up all night...

369
00:21:32,445 --> 00:21:34,812
- So could I.
- But I have to reclaim my title

370
00:21:34,847 --> 00:21:36,280
as the life of this and every party

371
00:21:36,315 --> 00:21:37,648
by making a drink so perfect...

372
00:21:37,684 --> 00:21:41,819
It seems like you need to relax.

373
00:21:41,854 --> 00:21:43,788
I'm married...

374
00:21:43,823 --> 00:21:45,122
to a woman.

375
00:21:45,158 --> 00:21:46,657
I have a boyfriend.

376
00:21:46,693 --> 00:21:49,293
but he's on another continent, so...

377
00:21:49,328 --> 00:21:51,662
it doesn't count.

378
00:21:51,698 --> 00:21:54,365
And where is your wife?

379
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,700
On another planet.

380
00:21:55,735 --> 00:21:58,803
Definitely doesn't count.

381
00:22:10,116 --> 00:22:12,583
Ahh. It's working.

382
00:22:12,618 --> 00:22:13,818
¿Qué?

383
00:22:13,853 --> 00:22:15,319
Nothing. Back at it.

384
00:22:20,326 --> 00:22:21,859
Eliot?

385
00:22:21,894 --> 00:22:25,262
Hey. You were talking in your sleep.

386
00:22:25,298 --> 00:22:27,131
What... what did you do?

387
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:30,768
I'm sorry. I get a little bit
enthusiastic sometimes.

388
00:22:30,803 --> 00:22:31,869
I'll be gentle.

389
00:22:31,904 --> 00:22:33,504
You've been in bed all day.

390
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:35,372
I came to check on you.

391
00:22:35,408 --> 00:22:38,375
I'm fine. I'm f-f-fine.

392
00:22:38,411 --> 00:22:41,112
Uh, are you sure you still want...

393
00:22:41,147 --> 00:22:42,446
Uh, I-I do.

394
00:22:42,482 --> 00:22:43,681
- What?
- I do...

395
00:22:43,716 --> 00:22:46,217
want to tell you I'm sorry.

396
00:22:46,252 --> 00:22:48,586
- I'm so sorry.
- For what?

397
00:22:48,621 --> 00:22:49,754
Um...

398
00:22:49,789 --> 00:22:51,889
I'm gonna go.

399
00:22:51,924 --> 00:22:53,824
Um...

400
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,160
No, no. No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

401
00:22:56,195 --> 00:22:58,162
I-I absolutely want
to have sex right now.

402
00:22:58,197 --> 00:23:00,664
You do?

403
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,267
Yeah.

404
00:23:08,674 --> 00:23:10,674
Ah...

405
00:23:13,212 --> 00:23:14,378
This is interesting.

406
00:23:14,413 --> 00:23:16,280
Do you want me to stop?

407
00:23:16,315 --> 00:23:18,916
Uh...

408
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:45,476
- Good morning, Quentin.
- How's Penny?

409
00:23:45,511 --> 00:23:48,846
He lost a lot of blood, but he'll live.

410
00:23:48,881 --> 00:23:50,781
You're ready for physical therapy.

411
00:23:50,817 --> 00:23:53,584
Some calisthenics maybe or core work?

412
00:23:53,619 --> 00:23:55,820
I had something else in mind, actually.

413
00:24:30,556 --> 00:24:33,524
You're exactly as good with
a bow as you are with an ax.

414
00:24:33,559 --> 00:24:36,594
Since I was a kid, The Beast has
been whispering shit in my ear.

415
00:24:36,629 --> 00:24:39,263
Now that he's dead, the world's
gotten a lot quieter...

416
00:24:39,298 --> 00:24:41,565
or would be if not for you out here

417
00:24:41,601 --> 00:24:45,269
thinking low-self-esteem shit.

418
00:24:45,304 --> 00:24:48,239
I'll re-do my wards.

419
00:24:48,274 --> 00:24:50,341
There's something in the Declan text

420
00:24:50,376 --> 00:24:52,476
about making arrows fly straight.

421
00:24:52,511 --> 00:24:53,677
Show me.

422
00:24:53,713 --> 00:24:55,279
If I had middle fingers,

423
00:24:55,314 --> 00:24:56,747
you know what they'd be doing right now?

424
00:24:56,782 --> 00:24:58,649
Start with Popper 31.

425
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:07,491
Now cross your index and ring fingers.

426
00:25:07,526 --> 00:25:10,728
No, under the middle.

427
00:25:10,763 --> 00:25:13,631
Now slide the thumb along the meridian.

428
00:25:13,666 --> 00:25:15,399
Now draw the arrow back.

429
00:25:22,708 --> 00:25:24,775
- Thank you.
- Thank me by shutting up.

430
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:27,645
There's a creature
called the White Lady.

431
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,313
I saw her yesterday.

432
00:25:29,348 --> 00:25:31,715
She's one of the seven
Questing Creatures of Fillory.

433
00:25:31,751 --> 00:25:34,952
If you can catch her, she has
to give you whatever you ask.

434
00:25:34,987 --> 00:25:37,027
Plover wrote about her,
called her the Winter's Doe.

435
00:25:37,056 --> 00:25:39,323
She lives in the Darkling Wood.

436
00:25:39,358 --> 00:25:40,624
It's just past the Flying Forest.

437
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:43,694
It's not far from here.

438
00:25:43,729 --> 00:25:45,362
We could hunt her together.

439
00:25:45,398 --> 00:25:47,998
"Let's go hunt the White Lady"?

440
00:25:48,034 --> 00:25:50,567
People like me get shot
for saying shit like that.

441
00:25:50,603 --> 00:25:52,937
She can give you your hands back.

442
00:25:52,972 --> 00:25:55,039
What's in it for you?

443
00:25:55,074 --> 00:25:57,608
I'm gonna ask her
to bring Alice back to life.

444
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:10,919
The river we crossed
was at the edge of it.

445
00:26:10,954 --> 00:26:14,389
So we're in the Flying Forest.

446
00:26:14,424 --> 00:26:17,725
What? Shouldn't the trees be,
like, flying and shit?

447
00:26:17,761 --> 00:26:21,162
Yeah, actually.
Most of them are crepuscular.

448
00:26:21,197 --> 00:26:24,399
It means they're active
at dawn and dusk.

449
00:26:24,434 --> 00:26:26,434
You smell that?

450
00:26:26,469 --> 00:26:27,902
It smells like...

451
00:26:27,938 --> 00:26:30,438
Good.

452
00:26:30,473 --> 00:26:32,373
What is that?

453
00:26:32,409 --> 00:26:34,409
I don't know.

454
00:26:34,444 --> 00:26:38,313
I th... I think I'm...
I'm getting a contact high.

455
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:41,215
Yeah. Definitely starting
to feel something.

456
00:26:41,251 --> 00:26:45,053
Flying Forest.

457
00:26:47,123 --> 00:26:48,723
Oh, my God.

458
00:26:48,758 --> 00:26:50,792
The Chatwins were, like, ten
when they came through here.

459
00:26:50,827 --> 00:26:52,527
They must have been blazed
the entire time.

460
00:26:52,562 --> 00:26:55,029
Super inappropriate.

461
00:26:55,065 --> 00:26:56,798
Hey, I-I take back what I said.

462
00:26:56,833 --> 00:26:58,900
I-I fully expect to see

463
00:26:58,935 --> 00:27:01,102
a tree flapping around at any second.

464
00:27:01,137 --> 00:27:03,371
Listen, Quincy, if we get a tree or...

465
00:27:03,406 --> 00:27:06,040
Did you just call me Quincy?

466
00:27:08,278 --> 00:27:11,446
Is... is that not your name?

467
00:27:15,318 --> 00:27:17,185
Dude...

468
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,087
dude, what the fuck?

469
00:27:19,122 --> 00:27:21,055
- Get away from my mouth, man.
- It's my mouth.

470
00:27:21,091 --> 00:27:22,790
- Uh...
- No, it's not.

471
00:27:22,826 --> 00:27:24,359
Oh.

472
00:27:24,394 --> 00:27:26,861
Oh, where... uh, where...

473
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:28,162
where are my stuff touchers?

474
00:27:28,198 --> 00:27:29,464
Aah! Ooh!

475
00:27:29,499 --> 00:27:32,166
What the fuck is going on?

476
00:27:32,202 --> 00:27:35,503
Who the fuck are you?

477
00:27:35,538 --> 00:27:38,339
Who am I?

478
00:27:38,375 --> 00:27:40,441
I have no idea.

479
00:27:40,477 --> 00:27:43,344
Okay.

480
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:47,515
The Beast shit in the Wellspring.

481
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:49,917
No. No. Ember.

482
00:27:49,953 --> 00:27:52,553
Ember shat in the Wellspring.

483
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:54,889
I think he meant well.

484
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:56,824
He probably didn't know

485
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,227
how hard it would be to clean out.

486
00:27:59,262 --> 00:28:03,865
And now magic is failing on Earth...

487
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,233
because of shit,

488
00:28:05,268 --> 00:28:07,468
proving once again
that comedy and tragedy

489
00:28:07,504 --> 00:28:10,204
can coexist
in the same goddamn sentence.

490
00:28:12,275 --> 00:28:15,510
Honestly...

491
00:28:15,545 --> 00:28:17,278
I am in over my head.

492
00:28:17,313 --> 00:28:20,081
I am not even in control of which world

493
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:22,417
my body is awake in,
and my sexually aggressive wife,

494
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:24,318
she could wake me up
at any moment in Fillory.

495
00:28:24,354 --> 00:28:26,554
Eliot, there are certain
student/teacher boundaries

496
00:28:26,589 --> 00:28:28,623
which I'd prefer not to cross.

497
00:28:28,658 --> 00:28:30,458
So what am I supposed to do, Henry?

498
00:28:30,493 --> 00:28:32,160
What did you think was going to happen

499
00:28:32,195 --> 00:28:35,063
when you dove headfirst
into another world?

500
00:28:42,105 --> 00:28:43,304
I thought I'd die.

501
00:28:43,339 --> 00:28:45,339
But you didn't.

502
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:48,109
Now you have two lives.

503
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:49,410
You're trying to live both.

504
00:28:49,446 --> 00:28:51,579
- Yes.
- Yes, but you can't.

505
00:28:51,614 --> 00:28:53,381
That's stupid.

506
00:28:53,416 --> 00:28:55,149
You can let it tear you in half

507
00:28:55,185 --> 00:28:57,552
or pick one.

508
00:28:57,587 --> 00:28:59,353
I can never leave Fillory.

509
00:28:59,389 --> 00:29:01,355
The choice is easy.

510
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:05,460
I am...

511
00:29:05,495 --> 00:29:07,595
ill-equipped to be a king.

512
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:10,064
I am no better equipped to teach one.

513
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:14,168
Being an adult is recognizing
your responsibilities.

514
00:29:14,204 --> 00:29:18,039
A bunch of my students went
and conquered another world.

515
00:29:18,074 --> 00:29:19,974
They more, like, gave it to us.

516
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:22,276
Either way,
it doesn't look great for me.

517
00:29:22,312 --> 00:29:25,213
It reeks of Earth privilege.

518
00:29:25,248 --> 00:29:27,515
The very least I can do is...

519
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:29,016
is to help you rule it.

520
00:29:31,654 --> 00:29:33,387
What do you have in mind?

521
00:29:33,423 --> 00:29:35,957
Bring in the best minds we can...

522
00:29:35,992 --> 00:29:38,192
historians, politicians,

523
00:29:38,228 --> 00:29:42,029
shamans, military leaders.

524
00:29:42,065 --> 00:29:46,567
Hmm. Your thesis project is...

525
00:29:46,603 --> 00:29:50,138
"How to Save an Entire Goddamn World."

526
00:29:59,616 --> 00:30:03,184
Right or left?

527
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:06,554
Right seems to be the popular direction.

528
00:30:11,628 --> 00:30:13,094
I must be an adventurer.

529
00:30:13,129 --> 00:30:15,296
No, you're not.

530
00:30:15,331 --> 00:30:17,265
What? I have a bow and arrow

531
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:21,202
and a cool questing outfit
and a manservant.

532
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:24,405
Oh-ho-ho, you did not
just say that, white boy.

533
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,576
Besides, what kind of servant
has no fucking hands?

534
00:30:32,649 --> 00:30:35,716
Right or left?

535
00:30:35,752 --> 00:30:38,119
Right seems to be the popular direction.

536
00:30:43,459 --> 00:30:46,394
Julia?

537
00:30:48,198 --> 00:30:49,997
What the hell are you doing here?

538
00:30:50,033 --> 00:30:51,632
- Look, I can explain.
- No.

539
00:30:51,668 --> 00:30:53,634
After you jumped in and screwed
everything up with Penny,

540
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:56,604
Alice died killing
your little friend Martin.

541
00:30:56,639 --> 00:30:59,407
Then Quentin was almost ripped in half.

542
00:30:59,442 --> 00:31:02,076
And you have the balls to come here.

543
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:03,277
Look, if you guys had trusted me,

544
00:31:03,313 --> 00:31:05,012
both Reynard and The Beast
would be dead.

545
00:31:05,048 --> 00:31:06,614
None of that would have happened.

546
00:31:06,649 --> 00:31:08,516
Quentin should have left you
in your little hedge hole,

547
00:31:08,551 --> 00:31:11,018
trading rim jobs for spells.

548
00:31:11,054 --> 00:31:13,588
You actually think because
you go to this bullshit school

549
00:31:13,623 --> 00:31:15,223
that you're better than me.

550
00:31:15,258 --> 00:31:18,092
I think I didn't get my friends killed.

551
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:20,127
You don't have friends.

552
00:31:20,163 --> 00:31:22,330
You have people
that are so afraid of you,

553
00:31:22,365 --> 00:31:24,765
they'd rather be on your side.

554
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:28,736
There's a difference.

555
00:31:28,771 --> 00:31:31,372
Well...

556
00:31:31,407 --> 00:31:34,208
and you have no one.

557
00:31:34,244 --> 00:31:36,110
And you deserve no one.

558
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:37,545
Look, I don't expect you to care

559
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,347
'cause this doesn't directly
affect your hair

560
00:31:39,382 --> 00:31:42,316
or your social life,
but since you let Reynard free,

561
00:31:42,352 --> 00:31:44,252
he has murdered over a dozen women,

562
00:31:44,287 --> 00:31:46,554
and this book might be
my last shot at killing him.

563
00:31:59,435 --> 00:32:01,435
The book's blank.

564
00:32:01,471 --> 00:32:04,338
Put yours in the box
and wait for them to mate.

565
00:32:04,374 --> 00:32:07,808
The baby should be a pretty
decent Xerox of the original.

566
00:32:27,344 --> 00:32:29,570
You know what this is?

567
00:32:29,595 --> 00:32:32,140
Ooh, this is a girl's.

568
00:32:35,112 --> 00:32:38,480
What if I'm supposed to be rescuing her?

569
00:32:38,515 --> 00:32:41,550
Ooh, or what if you're a stalker?

570
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:43,552
Right or left?

571
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:49,558
Right seems to be the popular direction.

572
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:52,094
Wait, no.

573
00:32:52,129 --> 00:32:54,596
If I'm supposed to find her, I...

574
00:32:54,631 --> 00:32:57,566
I have to look
where no one else is searching.

575
00:32:57,601 --> 00:32:59,601
What?

576
00:33:12,583 --> 00:33:15,317
Penny.

577
00:33:15,352 --> 00:33:18,220
Douche bag.

578
00:33:20,858 --> 00:33:23,859
The effect of the weed forest
is wearing off.

579
00:33:27,197 --> 00:33:28,864
Oh, my God.

580
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:35,270
It's Alice. Uh...

581
00:33:36,373 --> 00:33:39,107
Quentin, look, I...

582
00:33:39,143 --> 00:33:42,711
I know how you feel, man.

583
00:33:42,746 --> 00:33:46,882
Before, when your wards
were slipping, I...

584
00:33:46,917 --> 00:33:49,284
I know.

585
00:33:51,555 --> 00:33:54,656
- I can't.
- No, hey, no, no. Listen.

586
00:33:54,691 --> 00:33:57,259
You... you can't...

587
00:33:57,294 --> 00:34:00,195
you can't puss out right now.

588
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:02,564
Think about Alice. She needs you, man.

589
00:34:04,701 --> 00:34:06,868
I need you.

590
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,213
Hey.

591
00:34:18,248 --> 00:34:19,681
Hey.

592
00:34:19,716 --> 00:34:21,883
So I've been thinking.

593
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:25,820
Is 100 feet really tall enough
for Alice's memorial?

594
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:28,823
We weren't her friends, remember?

595
00:34:35,332 --> 00:34:38,867
We owe it to her...

596
00:34:38,902 --> 00:34:41,536
because we weren't her friends.

597
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:48,343
We don't have the money.

598
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:51,279
We're magicians.

599
00:34:51,315 --> 00:34:53,715
Let's build it ourselves.

600
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:58,853
Look, what Margo said about me was true.

601
00:34:58,889 --> 00:35:02,357
So if... if you want to bail,
now's your chance.

602
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:05,660
Well, you do have questionable judgment.

603
00:35:05,696 --> 00:35:08,763
I mean, we're best bitches, right?

604
00:35:08,799 --> 00:35:10,765
For better or for worse.

605
00:35:10,801 --> 00:35:11,967
God.

606
00:35:14,705 --> 00:35:16,438
Wait a minute.

607
00:35:16,473 --> 00:35:18,440
I know why Marina
wanted me to find the book.

608
00:35:18,475 --> 00:35:20,842
- Why?
- It's a necromancy spell.

609
00:35:20,877 --> 00:35:24,613
As in bring back to life?

610
00:35:24,648 --> 00:35:26,281
No, no fucking way.

611
00:35:26,316 --> 00:35:28,750
- Kady...
- She killed my mother.

612
00:35:28,785 --> 00:35:30,719
Look, the effects are unstable.

613
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:33,922
It'll only last a few minutes,
and then she goes away again.

614
00:35:33,957 --> 00:35:35,490
Fine.

615
00:35:37,761 --> 00:35:39,661
Fine. Let's defrost the bitch.

616
00:35:44,268 --> 00:35:48,303
It says the last ingredient
is the book itself.

617
00:35:48,338 --> 00:35:50,305
Then we got one chance.

618
00:36:03,754 --> 00:36:06,655
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

619
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:08,256
It's okay. It's okay.

620
00:36:08,292 --> 00:36:09,958
My skin is so cold.

621
00:36:09,993 --> 00:36:11,826
- It's okay. Look at me, please.
- You... you brought me back...

622
00:36:11,862 --> 00:36:13,502
You had a message you wanted to tell me.

623
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:15,797
- I'm gonna die.
- We don't have that much time.

624
00:36:15,832 --> 00:36:17,799
You don't understand.
You don't know where I was.

625
00:36:17,834 --> 00:36:19,934
I don't want to go back there.
I don't want to go back there.

626
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,703
Marina, your clock is running out, okay?

627
00:36:21,738 --> 00:36:23,738
Please, you are the strongest
person that I have ever met.

628
00:36:23,774 --> 00:36:25,473
I need you to pull it together now,

629
00:36:25,509 --> 00:36:26,941
and I need you to tell me.

630
00:36:26,977 --> 00:36:30,578
I need you to tell me
about the thing that killed you.

631
00:36:33,583 --> 00:36:35,317
You can stop him, Julia.

632
00:36:35,352 --> 00:36:38,520
It is possible, but you need to do it.

633
00:36:38,555 --> 00:36:41,022
- You need to do it.
- Okay, what?

634
00:36:41,058 --> 00:36:42,624
What do I need to do?

635
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:45,660
There was... a girl.

636
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:49,831
40 years ago,
she banished Reynard from Earth.

637
00:36:49,866 --> 00:36:51,966
That's where he was
until you summoned him.

638
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:54,869
That's where he was
until you brought him back.

639
00:36:54,905 --> 00:36:57,706
I'm sorr... I'm sorry.

640
00:37:17,961 --> 00:37:19,928
Shh.

641
00:37:57,645 --> 00:37:59,746
Hi.

642
00:37:59,771 --> 00:38:02,372
Don't run.

643
00:38:02,407 --> 00:38:04,374
Are you gonna?

644
00:38:07,012 --> 00:38:08,478
What's the deal?

645
00:38:08,513 --> 00:38:12,448
I don't know. She's kind of ignoring me.

646
00:38:12,484 --> 00:38:15,018
Yo, White Lady, we caught you.

647
00:38:15,053 --> 00:38:18,988
Hey, show some respect.

648
00:38:19,024 --> 00:38:22,725
Pardon me... Miss Lady?

649
00:38:22,761 --> 00:38:24,561
It hurts.

650
00:38:24,596 --> 00:38:27,397
Uh, sorry. Uh...

651
00:38:27,432 --> 00:38:28,765
Why have you come?

652
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,166
That's my arrow.

653
00:38:30,202 --> 00:38:31,668
You have to give me what I ask.

654
00:38:31,703 --> 00:38:35,104
Obviously, you turd.

655
00:38:41,513 --> 00:38:43,580
Look at you.

656
00:38:43,615 --> 00:38:47,550
Someone's been rebuilt...

657
00:38:47,586 --> 00:38:49,586
and so cleverly.

658
00:38:55,727 --> 00:38:57,727
Mm.

659
00:38:59,231 --> 00:39:01,197
Feel that?

660
00:39:02,767 --> 00:39:04,701
Could you not?

661
00:39:04,736 --> 00:39:06,769
Here's a riddle.

662
00:39:06,805 --> 00:39:08,338
How much do you have to lose

663
00:39:08,373 --> 00:39:10,773
before you're no longer yourself?

664
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:12,742
I don't know. Why don't you tell me?

665
00:39:12,777 --> 00:39:14,777
What is it, Quentin Coldwater,

666
00:39:14,813 --> 00:39:16,579
that you ache for?

667
00:39:16,615 --> 00:39:18,514
You have a crown

668
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:22,218
and the power to reshape
the very ether to your whim.

669
00:39:22,254 --> 00:39:25,688
What else could you possibly want?

670
00:39:25,724 --> 00:39:29,592
Um, technically speaking,
uh, we both caught you, so...

671
00:39:29,628 --> 00:39:31,628
Shut up. I'll ask for your
thing with my third wish.

672
00:39:31,663 --> 00:39:34,430
No. We each get a wish,

673
00:39:34,466 --> 00:39:37,200
and then we have one
mutually agreeable third wish.

674
00:39:37,235 --> 00:39:39,235
You can each have one wish,
or you can fuck off.

675
00:39:39,271 --> 00:39:40,536
Okay.

676
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:45,842
Alice Quinn...

677
00:39:47,345 --> 00:39:49,145
Bring her back to life...

678
00:39:51,182 --> 00:39:54,350
Please.

679
00:39:54,386 --> 00:39:56,719
I can't.

680
00:39:56,755 --> 00:39:59,088
What do you mean you can't?

681
00:39:59,124 --> 00:40:02,258
You are not the only magical
creature in this fucking forest.

682
00:40:02,294 --> 00:40:03,660
True.

683
00:40:03,695 --> 00:40:05,762
And we all have limits.

684
00:40:05,797 --> 00:40:08,064
We can give you anything.

685
00:40:08,099 --> 00:40:10,433
But we cannot pierce that veil.

686
00:40:10,468 --> 00:40:12,468
Alice is gone.

687
00:40:21,112 --> 00:40:24,514
My turn.

688
00:40:24,549 --> 00:40:26,316
I want my hands back.

689
00:40:26,351 --> 00:40:27,684
That I can do.

690
00:40:34,392 --> 00:40:38,361
No!

691
00:40:40,265 --> 00:40:41,497
What did you do to him?

692
00:40:41,533 --> 00:40:43,633
That screaming was irritating.

693
00:40:43,668 --> 00:40:45,735
He'll wake when he's healed.

694
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:48,771
Now, I can't nap
until I've granted your wish.

695
00:40:48,807 --> 00:40:51,207
I'd like to be happy. Could you do that?

696
00:40:51,242 --> 00:40:53,676
I can do wonders.

697
00:40:53,712 --> 00:40:55,778
But you should know...

698
00:40:55,814 --> 00:41:00,383
there's nothing I can give you
that will soothe your Shade.

699
00:41:00,418 --> 00:41:03,386
There's only what I can take away.

700
00:41:03,421 --> 00:41:05,755
You'd take away my memories of Alice?

701
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:08,658
Yes. I would free you completely.

702
00:41:11,629 --> 00:41:14,197
No.

703
00:41:14,232 --> 00:41:17,734
You are wiser than you appear.

704
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:20,937
You would find your way back to sadness,

705
00:41:20,972 --> 00:41:23,406
no matter how far you run from it.

706
00:41:23,441 --> 00:41:25,808
Well, that's comforting.

707
00:41:25,844 --> 00:41:29,645
Is there nothing else you desire?

708
00:41:29,681 --> 00:41:33,549
Everything I've ever wanted, I've got.

709
00:41:33,585 --> 00:41:37,453
Magic is real, and it can fix
anything except what I need.

710
00:41:39,224 --> 00:41:41,624
I loved a girl.

711
00:41:44,329 --> 00:41:47,563
My entire life...
I've dreamed of Fillory,

712
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:50,833
that I would be like Martin Chatwin.

713
00:41:50,869 --> 00:41:53,269
I'd find a way to stay here forever.

714
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:04,847
Send me home.

715
