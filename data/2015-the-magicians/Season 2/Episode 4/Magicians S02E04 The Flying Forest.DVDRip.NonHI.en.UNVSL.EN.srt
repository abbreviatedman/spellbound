1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,521
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:04,171 --> 00:00:05,469
Kady! No, no!

3
00:00:05,606 --> 00:00:07,472
Don't you... ing touch her!

4
00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:08,735
Fine. I'll take you first.

5
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:15,248
Now!

6
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:16,708
Julia!

7
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:18,183
- Move!
- Wait!

8
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:21,817
I had Reynard. I had The Beast.

9
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:23,651
Man, fuck this. We're out.

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,137
The chain was the only
thing keeping my hands from...

11
00:00:28,161 --> 00:00:30,027
Sorry. Not my problem.

12
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:31,998
Oh, shit.

13
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:33,176
Do you know what a Niffin is?

14
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,897
It's when too much runs
through you. Consumes you.

15
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:37,597
<i>Only the magic is left.</i>

16
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:40,038
Hard to cast when
you're sliced in two.

17
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:46,307
What is she doing?

18
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:47,745
She can't, she'll Niffin out.

19
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:49,444
Alice, stop!

20
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:54,945
Let's finally finish this.

21
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:57,617
I did it on purpose.

22
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:04,095
Alice, don't.

23
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,800
Five surgeries.

24
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:47,167
He'll recover.

25
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:49,367
I know we're being
serious right now,

26
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:52,003
but that surgeon
has the biggest dick.

27
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:59,715
Eliot, it's time we go.

28
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:04,185
Our kingdom awaits.

29
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:15,836
With The Beast dead, there's
a power vacuum in Fillory.

30
00:02:15,902 --> 00:02:17,268
"Power vacuum."

31
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:20,034
Hello. High King
and Queen right here.

32
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:23,100
We, of course, recognize
your rule, but others...

33
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,042
Everyone assumes
you'll be dead soon.

34
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:28,605
Or you'll run away,
or vanish, or go mad.

35
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:31,394
There are stirrings of rebellion
in the Southern Orchard,

36
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:32,442
the Outer Islands.

37
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:34,111
Refusal to pay
the Crown's taxes.

38
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:36,452
You know who loves paying taxes?

39
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,355
People with broken legs.

40
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:43,825
Abigail would remind you that
money cannot fill the Wellspring.

41
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:45,331
Without it, Fillory withers.

42
00:02:45,399 --> 00:02:47,425
Okay, well, we
talked about this.

43
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:49,728
When someone drops
a log at a public pool,

44
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:51,829
you just send a kid
with a net to fish it out.

45
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:55,740
The befouling was
substantial, Your Majesty.

46
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:57,641
We've employed
several filtration systems,

47
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,907
but the Wellspring isn't
recovering fast enough.

48
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,347
If there was a royal
appeal to Ember himself...

49
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:04,408
Okay, we can't find him.

50
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:07,215
He's not in his temple
or his filthy sex cave.

51
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,721
We need to devote
more resources...

52
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:11,588
We're going to build a
monument to our fallen queen.

53
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:15,420
A statue, I think. A
hundred feet high.

54
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:16,986
Do you know what
that would cost?

55
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:18,827
I don't care how much it costs.

56
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:22,669
I want designs drawn
up and funds funded.

57
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:23,736
Immediately.

58
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:27,134
Can you give us a moment?

59
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,734
I said get the fuck out!

60
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:39,551
So, that's the plan, huh?

61
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:43,121
Blow all our cash on sappy
nonsense, bankrupt the kingdom?

62
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,126
We have to do something.
Alice was our friend.

63
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:48,856
No. She wasn't.

64
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:51,965
Alice was a package deal.
She came with Quentin.

65
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,000
Somebody skipped
her colonic this morning.

66
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:56,502
For whatever stupid reason,

67
00:03:56,837 --> 00:04:00,069
you're the High
King of an entire land.

68
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,138
You have to be
responsible, Eliot.

69
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:03,768
Since when are
you Fillory Clinton?

70
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:05,470
Since I'm me.

71
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:09,843
My crown is just
as heavy as yours.

72
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,419
You can leave
whenever you feel like it.

73
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:14,216
You can go back to Brakebills,

74
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:15,778
you can do whatever
you goddamn want.

75
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:23,928
I don't belong here, I'm
not ready to be a king.

76
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,430
I wasn't done being me.

77
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,094
It was so much simpler

78
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:32,833
when there was just one
giant, evil dick trying to kill us.

79
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:34,902
And now we're just...

80
00:04:35,075 --> 00:04:36,407
Grown-ups?

81
00:04:37,043 --> 00:04:38,807
How did this happen?

82
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:42,907
I have an idea to help you.

83
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:44,542
Like a loophole? Mmm-hmm.

84
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:53,727
You're gonna ironically
abandon me here to go find it?

85
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,922
I'll be back. I promise.

86
00:04:58,532 --> 00:04:59,532
I know you...

87
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,127
Will.

88
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,092
Hey.

89
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:36,762
Kady.

90
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:40,333
Hey.

91
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,506
Kady, come on,
okay? I need your help.

92
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:48,338
Let's go.

93
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,705
You haven't had any other
problems with your casting?

94
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:16,810
I've had nothing but problems.

95
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,817
I thought it was
because of my hands,

96
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,542
but it's getting
worse, not better.

97
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:22,815
Huh.

98
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:28,715
I've had a few brownouts,
you could call them.

99
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,821
I mean, I thought it
was the Xanax, honestly.

100
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:32,417
How many?

101
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,484
Two a day, if I can get them.

102
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:37,186
Oh, you mean the brownouts.

103
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:38,459
Four or five.

104
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:40,499
Hmm.

105
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:45,630
Yes.

106
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:56,044
What happened?

107
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,616
I'm trying to get back here,
but my aim's been all off.

108
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:01,085
Okay. All right. It seems
like more than your aim.

109
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,783
Last three worlds I've been in
haven't had any fucking oxygen.

110
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:06,793
And my fingers, they
just keep shorting me out.

111
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:10,921
What happened?

112
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,124
Did we kill The Beast?

113
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:14,158
We did.

114
00:07:15,335 --> 00:07:19,739
But, um, Quentin
was pretty banged up.

115
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,100
Alice was hurt a
lot worse, Penny.

116
00:07:25,712 --> 00:07:28,409
She died.

117
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,222
Budget? ELIOT:
Citizen petitions.

118
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,262
I want everyone to
stop wanting things.

119
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:47,330
Great time to ask for something.

120
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:51,396
Your father makes knives for a
living and knows where I sleep.

121
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,134
So... Ask away.

122
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:59,576
I know I'm not
precisely the type

123
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,342
you'd most likely choose,

124
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:05,784
and I wasn't so experienced
when we were first together,

125
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:07,684
but you're so great at it.

126
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:10,019
You're... You're
huge and it's so good.

127
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,822
And Eliot, I don't know how
to politely ask you to fuck me.

128
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,555
Oh, look, Margo's here.

129
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:19,999
You remember Lasaro?

130
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,364
That creep who
made the Margolem?

131
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,562
I twisted his arms
and/or balls a little,

132
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:24,729
and he gave up the spell.

133
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:27,165
Living clay is hard to come by,

134
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,039
but Fogg left his
stash so unprotected,

135
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,703
it's like he wanted
me to steal it.

136
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,078
So, I did.

137
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,877
We're gonna make another you.

138
00:08:43,957 --> 00:08:45,892
Hey. JULIA: I made
you a sandwich.

139
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,893
Half an hour ago. Then I ate it.

140
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,859
I'm sorry.

141
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:53,999
It's been a long time
since I've had a hot shower.

142
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,558
How you feeling?

143
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:58,430
Better.

144
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:03,472
Nap. Seeing you
alive. Magic methadone.

145
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:06,305
Methadone.

146
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,941
Thanks. For all of it.

147
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:15,922
So, uh, how'd you find me?

148
00:09:16,456 --> 00:09:17,754
After asking around a bit,

149
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:21,124
I heard about a girl who was
doing miracles for a quick fix.

150
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,262
I called it "turning tricks."

151
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:24,954
You think I'm
judging you, I'm not.

152
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:28,058
No. No, I'm judging myself.

153
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:29,902
You...

154
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:33,272
You saved my life, and...

155
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:38,203
You know, I thought it
would be okay to run.

156
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:42,107
If I got the cavalry and I
came back to help you. But I...

157
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:44,444
I just ran.

158
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,046
I hid.

159
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,024
Yeah, well, there was
nothing you could've done then.

160
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,358
But you can help me now.

161
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,062
Oh, my God.

162
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,296
Julia, is that... Marina.

163
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:05,127
She helped me bait a trap
for Reynard. He killed her.

164
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:06,696
You freeze-dried her corpse?

165
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,264
Alonso's Reverse Thermogenesis.

166
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,365
But look.

167
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:12,839
She left this for a reason.

168
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,172
A message, or a code. I
mean, at least, I thought that.

169
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:17,808
No, no, I know
exactly what that is.

170
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,746
That's a locator number.

171
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:22,648
For a book in the
library at Brakebills.

172
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:39,872
Be careful.

173
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,966
That's a long drop
for human legs.

174
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:46,604
We would not want to see you
get hurt so soon after being rebuilt.

175
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,377
Rebuilt?

176
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:57,557
It's strange, I know.
But you'll get used to it.

177
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:01,117
Is this a hospital?
Are you a doctor?

178
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:02,423
You're at the Retreat.

179
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,828
A few hours' gallop
north of Whitespire.

180
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:07,027
I was a patient, years ago.

181
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,928
The centaurs saved my
life when no one else could.

182
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,235
Now I try to repay that debt
by serving them as a nurse.

183
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,735
The centaurs? Mmm.

184
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:17,001
Horse people.

185
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,076
Mmm-hmm.

186
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,045
How long have I... Three weeks.

187
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:22,181
Your injuries were severe.

188
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:26,413
Your friends were called
away, but they left that for you.

189
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,380
We can start physical
therapy in the morning.

190
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:53,374
<i>"Dear Q, we buried
Alice today in the gardens,</i>

191
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,074
<i>"where she'll
always be close by."</i>

192
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:58,117
<i>"We left a box of her
things, if you ever wake up.</i>

193
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,643
<i>"Please wake up.</i>

194
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:03,655
<i>"Your benevolent
overlord, High King Eliot."</i>

195
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:18,684
Hey.

196
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,169
Margo sent me here to
get my hands checked out.

197
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,373
Look...

198
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,373
It sucks about Alice.

199
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:33,211
"Sucks"?

200
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,311
That's the best that you can do?

201
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:36,583
I cared about her, too.

202
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:38,852
For what, like, 10
minutes, including foreplay?

203
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,703
Are you mad at me because
I cared too much or too little?

204
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:42,559
I'm mad 'cause you
fucked up the one thing

205
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,709
that we were counting on
you for. You wanna blame me?

206
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,893
It was your cacodemon
that killed her.

207
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,931
That was not Alice.
Alice was gone.

208
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:50,766
So you just saved the day, huh?

209
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,834
Can we just...

210
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:57,944
Convalesce from our horrible
injuries separately, please?

211
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:03,609
Nice to see you, too, man.

212
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:14,387
Good day. My name is
Sawbones. I will be examining you.

213
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:18,660
Ugh!

214
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,811
Those are the most accursed
things I've ever smelled.

215
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:22,529
They must be removed, posthaste.

216
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,830
How did they
become cursed? Uh...

217
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:30,737
Some guy, this valet-type-of-dude
at Chatwin's Torrent.

218
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,134
The River Watcher.

219
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:33,211
You know him?

220
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:34,881
I'm sorry, I... I
can't help you.

221
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,074
Dude, just chop them off

222
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,093
or give me some magic
wooden shit, like you did Quentin.

223
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:41,417
I'm a surgeon. I can't risk the
curse spreading to my own hands.

224
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:45,589
The River Watcher... He's
mercurial, and dangerous.

225
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:48,953
You erred greatly in
offending him, Penny.

226
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:53,489
Did you...

227
00:13:54,634 --> 00:13:56,330
Are you shitting?

228
00:13:58,604 --> 00:13:59,628
You're welcome.

229
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,177
What was I saying?

230
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:08,676
Me likey.

231
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,480
You're thinking about
banging yourself, aren't you?

232
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:12,551
Shh. Shh. Shh.

233
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:18,023
No, no, doing your clone is
more like AP-level masturbation.

234
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,022
Ugh. Put on a robe, would you?

235
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:28,825
Aw. Now, part two.

236
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:31,398
A variation on the
mind-control work

237
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,906
Mayakovsky hammered
us with first year.

238
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:36,406
You sleep here, your
mind goes into the golem.

239
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:38,035
And the golem
goes to Brakebills.

240
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:41,141
Unless, of course, we're wrong
about the fine print in my contract

241
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,910
and he can't leave
Fillory either...

242
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:46,646
Yeah, totally possible he touches
the button and just explodes.

243
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,389
Only one way to find out.

244
00:14:57,296 --> 00:14:58,559
Richard's alumni key.

245
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:00,794
It gets you past the
wards at Brakebills.

246
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:01,960
I was expelled.

247
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:04,098
Alarm bells will go
off the second I pop in.

248
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:07,265
I didn't go to school there. I mean,
how am I supposed to find this book?

249
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:12,172
It's the only one
the bodega had.

250
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:36,430
<i>Okay, bitch. Say something.</i>

251
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:40,095
You seeing this?

252
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:41,436
Head down this row.

253
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,106
Wait. Yeah... That
room on your left.

254
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:48,344
<i>It's got an anti-decay
charm on it.</i>

255
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:50,206
<i>It's where they
keep the good shit.</i>

256
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,117
<i>Got it.</i>

257
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,450
Wait. Wait, let
me see, hold it up.

258
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:05,629
Wait. Flip it to the back.

259
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,125
Damn it.

260
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,562
It's like a library LoJack.

261
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,315
It'll go off if you try to take the
book outside the Brakebills wards.

262
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:16,400
<i>I mean, this will take hours to
copy. Someone's gonna notice me.</i>

263
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,534
Well, not if you know
the right place to hide.

264
00:16:29,222 --> 00:16:32,351
Okay. Didn't explode so far.

265
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,259
Why does everything
smell so great?

266
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:39,732
Because your doppel-banger
hasn't met cocaine yet.

267
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,858
Todd! Todd! Todd!

268
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:46,604
Why is everyone cheering for...

269
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,240
Todd?

270
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:51,106
Oh, hey! You guys!

271
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:54,011
You made a lot of friends, huh?

272
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,605
I heard you guys were dead.

273
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:59,310
So, I threw this massive
rager in your honor.

274
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,752
The fact that you just
called it a rager sickens me.

275
00:17:01,921 --> 00:17:05,483
Thing is, it went great,

276
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:09,120
and everyone had so
much fun, that I kind of...

277
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:10,722
Became the new me.

278
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:18,403
Todd, answer truthfully.
Are you wearing my vest?

279
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,571
I am wearing your vest.

280
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:24,268
Keep it.

281
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:25,644
New plan.

282
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:27,105
I give up on Fillory

283
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:29,906
and dedicate myself
completely to destroying Todd.

284
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,842
Oh, it's just Todd.

285
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:35,582
"Just Todd"? He's usurping
me. My entire kingdom is at stake.

286
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:38,352
Your actual kingdom
is actually at stake.

287
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:41,086
There are some things more
important than saving an entire world.

288
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,856
Okay, I'm gonna go out on a limb

289
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:45,364
and say this isn't
really about Todd.

290
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:49,967
You don't say, Margo.

291
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,604
No killing Todd!

292
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:56,439
Fucking Todd.

293
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:33,072
Is this a bad time?

294
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,782
Come sit over here.

295
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:44,883
I saw a strange woman.

296
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:49,827
She's pale and had horn things.

297
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,726
You've seen The White Lady.

298
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:54,328
I'm sorry, "White Lady"?

299
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:58,131
You are fortunate she offered
herself to some centaur's sight

300
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:00,173
while you happened
to be watching.

301
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,336
Is that...

302
00:19:08,047 --> 00:19:09,071
Skin.

303
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:14,477
It won't feel, but it might help
you forget what's underneath.

304
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,531
Get up, Coldwater.
What happened?

305
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,803
My hands tried to kill me,
so I broke my own arms.

306
00:19:38,544 --> 00:19:40,322
Look, forget all that mean
shit I said to you earlier.

307
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,026
The bronies can't fix
me, I need your help.

308
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,647
Okay, I guess.

309
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:48,620
First things first. Find an ax.

310
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:54,053
Are you sure about this?

311
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:59,391
Do you know how strong booze
has to be to get a horse drunk?

312
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,970
I can't feel my face,
much less my face.

313
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:07,170
I mean, hands.

314
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:11,040
Just do it.

315
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:12,577
I'm going to, jeez.

316
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:18,917
Nope.

317
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:20,844
Damn it, Quentin!

318
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,698
Sorry. I just... I panicked.
I don't love blood.

319
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:26,784
Who loves blood? I'm not
gonna feel anything, so fucking go!

320
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:28,336
I don't think I can
do this. Oh, my God!

321
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,880
I knew I fucking
couldn't count on you.

322
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:31,295
You are so fucking pathetic,

323
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:36,096
you floppy-haired,
limp-dicked dork, fucking...

324
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:37,728
No wonder Alice
couldn't get off on you,

325
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,238
you have no fuck...

326
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:40,830
Oh, I fucking feel it!

327
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,050
Okay. Okay. Oh, what did you do?

328
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,337
I can fix it! I can fix it!

329
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:56,589
Oh, I wouldn't.

330
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,288
Todd made that. It's vile.

331
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,197
Here.

332
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,268
Mmm.

333
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:11,703
Delicious.

334
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,804
I'm Eliot. Javier.

335
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,202
You're a first-year?

336
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:18,436
Second-year.

337
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:20,742
Universidad de Asombro in Spain.

338
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,776
I'm here for the
Welters tournament.

339
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:23,915
Oh. Mmm-hmm.

340
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,314
I would make a joke
about ball-handling,

341
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:29,219
but I'm deadly serious
about ball-handling.

342
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,654
Me too.

343
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,182
Listen, Javier, I could keep
this up all night. So could I.

344
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,626
But I have to reclaim my title

345
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:37,128
as the life of this
and every party

346
00:21:37,196 --> 00:21:38,789
by making a drink so perfect...

347
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:40,662
It seems like you need to relax.

348
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,430
I'm married.

349
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,299
To a woman. I have a boyfriend.

350
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:51,700
But he's on another
continent, so it doesn't count.

351
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:54,878
And where is your wife?

352
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,010
On another planet.

353
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:00,051
Definitely doesn't count.

354
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:13,727
It's working.

355
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:15,099
<i>Qué?</i>

356
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:16,702
Nothing, back at it.

357
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,440
<i>Eliot?</i>

358
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:25,307
Hey. You were
talking in your sleep.

359
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:27,980
What did you do?

360
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:31,950
I'm sorry, I get a little bit
enthusiastic sometimes.

361
00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:33,318
I'll be gentle.

362
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:35,445
You've been in bed all
day, I came to check on you.

363
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:39,421
I'm fine. I'm fine.

364
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,623
You sure you still want... I do.

365
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:44,959
What? I do...

366
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:48,595
Want to tell you I'm
sorry. I'm so sorry.

367
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:49,801
For what?

368
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:50,902
Um...

369
00:22:52,438 --> 00:22:54,373
I'm gonna go. Um...

370
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:59,067
No, no, no, no, no, no. I absolutely
wanna have sex right now.

371
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:01,841
You do?

372
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:04,009
Yeah.

373
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:11,122
Ah.

374
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:15,621
This is interesting.

375
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,026
Do you want me to stop?

376
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,731
Uh...

377
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:44,923
Good morning, Quentin.

378
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:46,291
How is Penny?

379
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:49,252
He lost a lot of
blood, but he'll live.

380
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:52,058
You're ready for
physical therapy.

381
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:54,497
Some calisthenics,
maybe, or core work?

382
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:57,001
I had something
else in mind, actually.

383
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:34,068
You're exactly as good with
a bow as you are with an ax.

384
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:37,707
Since I was a kid, The Beast
has been whispering shit in my ear.

385
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,072
Now that he's dead, the
world's gotten a lot quieter.

386
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:42,678
Or would be, if
not for you out here

387
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:44,683
thinking low self-esteem shit.

388
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:48,052
I'll re-do my wards.

389
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,916
There's something in the Declan
text about making arrows fly straight.

390
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:54,993
Show me.

391
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:57,654
If I had middle fingers, you know
what they'd be doing right now?

392
00:24:58,097 --> 00:24:59,656
Start with Popper No. 31.

393
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:07,872
Now cross your
index and ring fingers.

394
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:10,436
No, under the middle.

395
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:14,240
Now slide the thumb
along the meridian.

396
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,381
Now draw the arrow back.

397
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,984
Thank you. Thank
me by shutting up.

398
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:28,323
There's a creature
called The White Lady.

399
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:30,185
I saw her yesterday.

400
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:32,857
She's one of the seven
Questing Creatures of Fillory.

401
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:36,263
If you can catch her, she has
to give you whatever you ask.

402
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,246
Plover wrote about her, he
called her the Winter's Doe.

403
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,829
She lives in the Darkling Wood.

404
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:43,601
It's just past the Flying
Forest, it's not far from here.

405
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:46,443
We could hunt her together.

406
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:48,504
Let's go hunt The White Lady?

407
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:51,746
People like me get shot
for saying shit like that.

408
00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:53,513
She can give you
your hands back.

409
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,752
What's in it for you?

410
00:25:56,455 --> 00:25:59,687
I'm gonna ask her to
bring Alice back to life.

411
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:11,966
So the river we crossed
was at the edge of it.

412
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:15,299
So, we're in the Flying Forest.

413
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:19,335
Shouldn't the trees
be, like, flying and shit?

414
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:22,313
Yes, actually. Most of
them are crepuscular.

415
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:25,350
It means they're active
at dawn and dusk.

416
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:27,616
You smell that?

417
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,289
It smells like... Good.

418
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:33,552
What is that?

419
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:35,488
I don't know.

420
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:39,263
I think I'm getting
a contact high.

421
00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:42,499
Yeah. Definitely
starting to feel something.

422
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,801
"Flying Forest"?

423
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:50,199
Oh, my God,

424
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,420
the Chatwins were, like, 10
when they came through here.

425
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,276
They must've been
blazed the entire time.

426
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:56,405
Super inappropriate.

427
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,262
Hey, I take back what I said.

428
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:02,612
I fully expect to see a tree
flapping around at any second.

429
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:04,790
Listen, Quincy, if
we get a tree or...

430
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,051
Did you just call me Quincy?

431
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:13,128
Is that not your name?

432
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:18,195
Dude.

433
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:20,197
Dude, what the fuck?

434
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:21,935
Get away from my mouth, man.

435
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:23,134
It's my mouth. Ahh.

436
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,308
No, it's not.

437
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:25,376
Oh!

438
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:29,876
Oh, where, uh, where
are my stuff touchers?

439
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:31,048
Ha! Ooh!

440
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,319
What the fuck is going on?

441
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:34,846
Who the fuck are you?

442
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:38,788
Who am I?

443
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,152
I have no idea.

444
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:44,126
Okay.

445
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:48,601
The Beast shit
in the Wellspring?

446
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:54,106
No. No. Ember. Ember
shat in the Wellspring.

447
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:56,336
I think he meant well.

448
00:27:56,408 --> 00:28:00,106
He probably didn't know how
hard it would be to clean out.

449
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:04,772
And now, magic
is failing on Earth

450
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,610
because of shit.

451
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:09,013
Proving once again
that comedy and tragedy

452
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:11,886
can coexist in the same
goddamn sentence.

453
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:18,824
Honestly, I am in over my head.

454
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:22,698
I am not even in control of
which world my body is awake in,

455
00:28:22,768 --> 00:28:24,100
and my sexually-aggressive wife,

456
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:25,969
she could wake me up
at any moment in Fillory.

457
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:28,283
Eliot, there are certain
student-teacher boundaries

458
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:30,276
which I'd prefer not to cross.

459
00:28:30,342 --> 00:28:32,072
So what am I
supposed to do, Henry?

460
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:33,806
What did you think
was going to happen

461
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:36,610
when you dove headfirst
into another world?

462
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,324
I thought I'd die.
But you didn't.

463
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:48,627
And now you have two lives.

464
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:51,694
You're trying to live both. Yes.

465
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:54,790
Yes, but you
can't. That's stupid.

466
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:58,697
You can let it tear
you in half or pick one.

467
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:01,029
I can never leave Fillory.

468
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:02,267
The choice is easy.

469
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:09,241
I am ill-equipped to be a king.

470
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:11,575
I am no better
equipped to teach one.

471
00:29:11,717 --> 00:29:15,313
Being an adult is recognizing
your responsibilities.

472
00:29:15,721 --> 00:29:19,715
A bunch of my students went
and conquered another world.

473
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:21,483
They more like gave it to us.

474
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,961
Either way, it doesn't
look great for me.

475
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:26,828
It reeks of Earth privilege.

476
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:30,562
The very least I can
do is to help you rule it.

477
00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:34,672
What do you have in mind?

478
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,938
Bring in the best minds we can.

479
00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:42,614
Historians, politicians,
shamans, military leaders.

480
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,551
Your thesis project is...

481
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:51,789
"How to Save an
Entire Goddamn World."

482
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:03,497
Right or left?

483
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:08,269
Right seems to be
the popular direction.

484
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:14,773
I must be an adventurer.

485
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:16,838
No, you're not.

486
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:21,214
What? I have a bow and
arrow and a cool questing outfit.

487
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:22,586
And a manservant.

488
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:26,054
Oh, you did not just
say that, white boy.

489
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:30,061
Besides, what kind of
servant has no fucking hands?

490
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:36,200
Right or left?

491
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,763
Right seems to be
the popular direction.

492
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:47,736
Julia?

493
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:51,449
What the hell are
you doing here?

494
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,609
Look, I can explain. No.

495
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,347
After you jumped in and
screwed everything up with Penny,

496
00:30:55,454 --> 00:30:58,049
Alice died, killing
your little friend Martin.

497
00:30:58,123 --> 00:31:01,093
Then Quentin was
almost ripped in half.

498
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:03,424
And you have the
balls to come here?

499
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:04,927
Look, if you guys
had trusted me,

500
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:06,760
both Reynard and The
Beast would be dead.

501
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:07,942
None of that would've happened.

502
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:10,197
Quentin should've left
you in your little hedge hole,

503
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:12,567
trading rim jobs for spells.

504
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:15,641
You actually think because
you go to this bullshit school,

505
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:16,787
that you're better than me?

506
00:31:16,842 --> 00:31:19,209
I think I didn't get
my friends killed.

507
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:21,177
You don't have friends.

508
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,976
You have people that are so afraid
of you, they'd rather be on your side.

509
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:28,310
There's a difference.

510
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:34,654
Well, and you have no one.

511
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:37,721
And you deserve no one.

512
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:39,173
Look, I don't expect you to care

513
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:42,258
'cause this doesn't directly
affect your hair or your social life,

514
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:43,830
but since you let Reynard free,

515
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,803
he has murdered
over a dozen women

516
00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:48,238
and this book might be
my last shot at killing him.

517
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:02,484
The book's blank.

518
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:05,918
Put yours in the box
and wait for them to mate.

519
00:32:05,991 --> 00:32:09,052
The baby should be a pretty
decent Xerox of the original.

520
00:32:29,848 --> 00:32:31,339
You know what this is?

521
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:34,409
Oh. It's a girl's.

522
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:39,889
What if I'm supposed
to be rescuing her?

523
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:43,185
Ooh! Or what if
you're a stalker?

524
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:45,796
Right or left?

525
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:51,303
Right seems to be
the popular direction.

526
00:32:52,037 --> 00:32:53,335
Wait, no.

527
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:59,068
If I'm supposed to find her, I have to
look where no one else is searching.

528
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:01,371
What?

529
00:33:15,227 --> 00:33:16,388
Penny.

530
00:33:18,263 --> 00:33:20,061
Douchebag.

531
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:25,801
Effect of the weed
forest is wearing off.

532
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:30,801
Oh, my God.

533
00:33:31,977 --> 00:33:33,673
Oh.

534
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,777
It's Alice, uh...

535
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,685
Quentin, look. I know
how you feel, man.

536
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:46,903
Before, when your
wards were slipping, I...

537
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:51,057
I know.

538
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:56,791
I can't. No, hey,
no, no. Listen.

539
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:58,562
You can't...

540
00:33:59,905 --> 00:34:01,897
You can't puss out right now.

541
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:05,003
Think about Alice.
She needs you, man.

542
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:09,475
I need you.

543
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:20,583
Hey.

544
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,059
Hi.

545
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:23,718
So, I've been thinking,

546
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:28,097
is 100 feet really tall
enough for Alice's memorial?

547
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:31,364
We weren't her
friends, remember?

548
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:39,107
We owe it to her.

549
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,947
Because we weren't her friends.

550
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:49,881
We don't have the money.

551
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:52,290
We're Magicians.

552
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:56,225
Let's build it ourselves.

553
00:34:58,797 --> 00:35:01,028
Look, what Margo
said about me was true.

554
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:04,128
So, if you wanna bail,
now's your chance.

555
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:07,305
Well, you do have
questionable judgment.

556
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:12,099
I mean, we're
"Best Bitches," right?

557
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,302
For better or for worse. God.

558
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:18,148
Wait a minute.

559
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:20,982
I know why Marina
wanted me to find the book.

560
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:23,453
Why? It's a necromancy spell.

561
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:25,819
As in, bring back to life?

562
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:29,320
No. No fucking way. Kady...

563
00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:31,090
She killed my mother.

564
00:35:31,162 --> 00:35:32,687
Look, the effects are unstable.

565
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:35,124
It'll only last a few minutes,
and then she goes away again.

566
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:37,728
Fine.

567
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:42,035
Fine, let's defrost the bitch.

568
00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:49,207
It says the last ingredient
is the book itself.

569
00:35:50,782 --> 00:35:52,842
Then we got one chance.

570
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:08,457
Marina.

571
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,166
It's okay. It's okay.

572
00:36:11,269 --> 00:36:12,328
My skin is so cold.

573
00:36:12,404 --> 00:36:14,532
It's okay. Look at me.
You brought me back.

574
00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:15,716
You had a message
you wanted to tell me...

575
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,073
Now I'm gonna die. We
don't have that much time.

576
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:20,169
You don't understand.
You don't know where I was.

577
00:36:20,245 --> 00:36:22,373
I don't wanna go back
there. I don't wanna go back!

578
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:24,325
Marina, your clock is
running out, okay? Please.

579
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:26,260
You are the strongest
person that I have ever met.

580
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:29,186
I need you to pull it together
now, and I need you to tell me.

581
00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:31,951
I need you to tell me about
the thing that killed you.

582
00:36:36,094 --> 00:36:37,653
You can stop him, Julia.

583
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:42,724
It is possible, but you need
to do it. You need to do it.

584
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,927
Okay. What? What
do I need to do?

585
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,071
There was a girl.

586
00:36:48,173 --> 00:36:51,940
Forty years ago, she
banished Reynard from Earth.

587
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,370
That's where he was
until you summoned him.

588
00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:57,348
That's where he was
until you brought him back.

589
00:36:57,916 --> 00:36:59,145
I'm sorry.

590
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,946
I'm sorry.

591
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:22,005
Shh.

592
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:01,469
Hi.

593
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:03,747
Don't run.

594
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,613
Are you gonna?

595
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:11,148
What's the deal?

596
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:12,849
I don't know, she's
kind of ignoring me.

597
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,591
Yo, White Lady, we caught you.

598
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:19,425
Hey, show some respect.

599
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:22,890
Pardon me...

600
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:25,094
Miss... Lady?

601
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:27,000
It hurts.

602
00:38:28,206 --> 00:38:29,367
Sorry. Uh...

603
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,541
Why have you come?

604
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:34,511
That's my arrow. You
have to give me what I ask.

605
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:36,444
Obviously, you turd.

606
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:45,147
Well, look at you.

607
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:49,393
Someone's been rebuilt.

608
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:53,526
And so cleverly.

609
00:38:58,903 --> 00:38:59,903
Hmm.

610
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:03,066
Feel that?

611
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:06,677
Could you not?

612
00:39:07,612 --> 00:39:08,841
Here's a riddle.

613
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:13,243
How much do you have to lose
before you're no longer yourself?

614
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:15,417
I don't know. Why
don't you tell me?

615
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:18,888
What is it, Quentin
Coldwater, that you ache for?

616
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:20,854
You have a crown

617
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:24,390
and the power to reshape
the very ether to your whim.

618
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:27,728
What else could
you possibly want?

619
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:32,265
Um, technically speaking,
we both caught you, so...

620
00:39:32,337 --> 00:39:34,281
Shut up. I'll ask for your
thing with my third wish.

621
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:37,070
No, we each get a wish,

622
00:39:37,141 --> 00:39:39,406
and then we have one
mutually-agreeable third wish.

623
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:41,776
You can each have one
wish or you can fuck off.

624
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:42,905
Okay.

625
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:47,882
Alice Quinn.

626
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:51,813
Bring her back to life.

627
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:55,219
Please.

628
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:58,557
I can't.

629
00:39:59,631 --> 00:40:00,929
What do you mean, you can't?

630
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:04,893
You are not the only magical
creature in this fucking forest!

631
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:05,969
True.

632
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:08,363
And we all have limits.

633
00:40:08,806 --> 00:40:12,607
We can give you anything,
but we cannot pierce that veil.

634
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:14,678
Alice is gone.

635
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:25,083
My turn.

636
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,655
I want my hands back.

637
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:30,354
That I can do.

638
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:44,266
What did you do to him?

639
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:46,243
That screaming was irritating.

640
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,742
He'll wake when he's healed.

641
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:51,549
Now, I can't nap until
I've granted you a wish.

642
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:53,881
I'd like to be happy.
Could you do that?

643
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,318
I can do wonders.

644
00:40:56,587 --> 00:40:57,748
But you should know,

645
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,716
there is nothing I can give you

646
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,658
that will soothe your Shade.

647
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:05,287
There is only what
I can take away.

648
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:08,229
You'd take away my
memories of Alice?

649
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,402
Yes. I would free
you completely.

650
00:41:14,739 --> 00:41:15,763
No.

651
00:41:17,008 --> 00:41:18,806
You are wiser than you appear.

652
00:41:20,712 --> 00:41:23,181
You would find your
way back to sadness,

653
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:26,077
no matter how
far you run from it.

654
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:28,518
Well, that's comforting.

655
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,918
Is there nothing
else you desire?

656
00:41:32,457 --> 00:41:34,358
Everything I've
ever wanted, I've got.

657
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,525
Magic is real and it can fix
anything except what I need.

658
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:43,832
I loved a girl.

659
00:41:47,205 --> 00:41:50,232
My entire life, I've
dreamed of Fillory.

660
00:41:50,308 --> 00:41:52,243
That I would be
like Martin Chatwin.

661
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:55,976
I'd find a way to
stay here forever.

662
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:06,823
Send me home.
