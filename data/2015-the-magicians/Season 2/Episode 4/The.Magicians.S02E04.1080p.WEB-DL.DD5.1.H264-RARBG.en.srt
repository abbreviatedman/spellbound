1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,769
<i>- Previously
on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:08,073
- No, no, no.
- Don't you fucking touch her.

3
00:00:08,075 --> 00:00:09,575
Fine, I'll take you first.

4
00:00:09,577 --> 00:00:11,477
No!
No.

5
00:00:14,148 --> 00:00:15,781
- Now!

6
00:00:15,783 --> 00:00:17,116
- Julia.
- Move!

7
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:19,385
Wait.

8
00:00:19,387 --> 00:00:21,587
- I had Reynard.
I had the beast.

9
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:23,589
- Man, fuck this.
We're out.

10
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:28,227
The chain was the only thing
keeping my hand from...

11
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:31,397
- sorry.
Not my problem.

12
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:33,065
- Do you know what a niffin is?

13
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:34,266
It's when too much
runs through you,

14
00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:35,367
<i>consumes you.</i>

15
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,269
<i>Only the magic is left.</i>

16
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:42,141
- Hard to cast
when you're sliced in two.

17
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:46,078
What is she doing?

18
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,147
She can't.
She'll niffin out.

19
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,481
Alice, stop.

20
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:56,121
- Let's finally finish this.

21
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:58,123
- He did it on purpose.

22
00:01:02,462 --> 00:01:06,398
- Alice, don't.

23
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,172
- Five surgeries.
- He'll recover.

24
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:49,408
- I know we're being serious
right now,

25
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,411
but that surgeon
has the biggest dick.

26
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:00,586
Eliot, it's time to go.

27
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,323
- Our kingdom awaits.

28
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,667
- With the beast dead, there's
a power vacuum in Fillory.

29
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,336
- Power vacuum?

30
00:02:17,338 --> 00:02:19,905
Hello?
High king and queen right here.

31
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:23,208
- We, of course, recognize your
rule, but others...

32
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,710
- everyone assumes
you'll be dead soon...

33
00:02:24,712 --> 00:02:28,680
Or you'll run away
or vanish or go mad.

34
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:30,349
- There are stirrings
of rebellion

35
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:32,284
in the Southern orchard,
the outer islands,

36
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:34,219
refusal to pay
the crown's taxes.

37
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:36,421
- You know who loves
paying taxes?

38
00:02:36,423 --> 00:02:38,357
People with broken legs.

39
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:41,527
- Abigail would remind you

40
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:43,629
that money cannot fill
the wellspring.

41
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:45,364
Without it, Fillory withers.

42
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:47,399
- Okay, well,
we talked about this.

43
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:49,401
When someone drops a log
at a public pool,

44
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:51,537
you just send a kid with a net
to fish it out.

45
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:55,507
- The befouling
was substantial, your majesty.

46
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,509
We've employed
several filtration systems,

47
00:02:57,511 --> 00:03:00,245
but the wellspring
isn't recovering fast enough.

48
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:02,481
- If there was a royal appeal
to ember himself...

49
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:04,383
- okay, we can't find him.

50
00:03:04,385 --> 00:03:07,252
He's not in his temple
or his filthy sex cave.

51
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:08,620
- We need to devote
more resources.

52
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:09,955
- We're going to build
a monument

53
00:03:09,957 --> 00:03:11,523
to our fallen queen...

54
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:14,226
A statue, I think...

55
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:15,527
100 feet high.

56
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:16,962
- Do you know
what that would cost?

57
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:18,964
- I don't care
how much it costs.

58
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:21,667
I want designs drawn up
and funds...

59
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:24,970
Funded immediately.

60
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:28,540
- Can you give us a moment?

61
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,543
I said get the fuck out.

62
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:39,585
So that's the plan, huh...

63
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:41,820
Blow all our cash
on sappy nonsense,

64
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:43,288
bankrupt the kingdom?

65
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,723
- We have to do something.

66
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,225
Alice was our friend.

67
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:48,627
- No. She wasn't.

68
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:51,730
Alice was a package deal.
She came with Quentin.

69
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,765
- Somebody skipped her colonic
this morning.

70
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:56,668
- For whatever stupid reason,

71
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:00,305
you're the high king
of an entire land.

72
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:01,840
You have to be
responsible, Eliot.

73
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:03,709
- Since when are you
Fillory Clinton?

74
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:05,811
- Since I'm me.

75
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:09,715
My crown is just as heavy
as yours.

76
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:12,451
- You can leave
whenever you feel like it.

77
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:14,019
You can go back to Brakebills.

78
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:17,256
You can do whatever
you goddamn want.

79
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,294
I don't belong here.

80
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:23,762
I'm not ready to be a king.

81
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:27,599
I wasn't done being me.

82
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,701
It was so much simpler
when there was just

83
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:33,472
one giant evil dick
trying to kill us.

84
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:36,375
Now we're just...
- grown-ups.

85
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:40,479
- How did this happen?

86
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:42,714
- I have an idea...
To help you.

87
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:45,651
- Like a loophole?
- Mm-hmm.

88
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:53,792
- You're gonna ironically
abandon me here to go find it.

89
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,827
- I'll be back.
I promise.

90
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,499
- I know you...

91
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:02,367
Will.

92
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,534
Hey.

93
00:05:35,536 --> 00:05:38,670
- Kady?

94
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:39,838
Hey.

95
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:44,409
- Kady, come on,
I need your help.

96
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:48,747
Let's go.

97
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,740
- You haven't had any other
problems with your casting?

98
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:16,875
- I've had nothing but problems.

99
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,610
I thought it was because
of my hands,

100
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:21,613
but it's getting worse,
not better.

101
00:06:21,615 --> 00:06:24,449
- Hmm.

102
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:28,687
I've had a few...
Brownouts, you could call them.

103
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:30,956
I mean, I thought it was
the Xanax, honestly.

104
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,624
- How many?

105
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:35,560
- Two a day if I can get them.

106
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:36,895
Oh, you mean the brownouts.

107
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,164
Four or five.

108
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,499
Hmm.

109
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,804
- Yes.

110
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:56,515
- What happened?

111
00:06:56,517 --> 00:06:58,450
- I'm trying to get back here,
but my aim's off.

112
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:00,719
- Okay, all right, it seems like
more than your aim.

113
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:01,887
- Last three worlds I've been in

114
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:03,755
haven't had any fucking oxygen.

115
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,625
My fingers just... they just...
They just keep shorting me out.

116
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:11,897
What happened?
Did we kill the beast?

117
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:13,899
- We did.

118
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:20,038
- But, um, Quentin's
pretty banged up.

119
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,841
Alice was hurt
a lot worse, penny.

120
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:28,046
She... she died.

121
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:40,659
- Budget?
- Citizen petitions.

122
00:07:40,661 --> 00:07:43,962
I want everyone
to stop wanting things.

123
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:47,833
Great time to ask for something?

124
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:49,935
- Your father makes knives
for a living

125
00:07:49,937 --> 00:07:51,703
and knows where I sleep, so...

126
00:07:51,705 --> 00:07:53,905
Ask away.

127
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:59,244
- I'm know I'm not precisely
the type

128
00:07:59,246 --> 00:08:01,480
you'd most likely choose,

129
00:08:01,482 --> 00:08:05,684
and I wasn't so experienced
when we were first together,

130
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:06,985
but you're so great at it.

131
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,955
You're... you're huge,
and it's so good.

132
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:13,792
And, Eliot, I don't know how
to politely ask you to fuck me.

133
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,929
- Oh, look, Margo’s here.

134
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:19,764
- You remember Lasaro?

135
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:21,066
- That creep who made
the margolem?

136
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:23,568
- I twisted his arms
and/or balls a little,

137
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,604
and he gave up the spell.

138
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:26,872
Living Clay is hard to come by,

139
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:29,608
but Fogg left his stash
so unprotected,

140
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,843
it's like
he wanted me to steal it.

141
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,579
So I did.

142
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:36,715
We're gonna make another you.

143
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:44,623
- Hey.

144
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:47,592
- Made you a sandwich...
Half an hour ago.

145
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:49,594
Then I ate it.

146
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:51,096
- I'm sorry.

147
00:08:51,098 --> 00:08:53,899
It's been a long time
since I've had a hot shower.

148
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:55,033
- How you feeling?

149
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,068
- Uh...

150
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,904
Better...

151
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:01,740
Nap, seeing you alive,

152
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:04,609
magic methadone...

153
00:09:04,611 --> 00:09:07,812
Methadone.

154
00:09:07,814 --> 00:09:09,648
Thanks...

155
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,150
For all of it.

156
00:09:12,152 --> 00:09:16,321
So, um, how did you find me?

157
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:18,757
- After asking around a bit,
I heard about a girl

158
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,892
who was doing miracles
for a quick fix.

159
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:23,061
- I called it
"turning tricks."

160
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,963
- You think I'm judging you,
I'm not.

161
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:28,767
- No.
No, I'm judging myself.

162
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:32,137
You... you saved my life,

163
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:34,806
and...

164
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:38,777
You know, i-i thought
it would be okay to run...

165
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:41,012
If I got the cavalry
and I came back to help you,

166
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:42,914
but I...

167
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:46,685
I just ran.

168
00:09:46,687 --> 00:09:48,753
I hid.

169
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:52,824
- Yeah, well, there was nothing
you could have done then.

170
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:56,628
But you can help me now.

171
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,897
Oh, my god.

172
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:01,199
Ju... Julia, is that...
- marina.

173
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:04,002
She helped me bait a trap
for Reynard.

174
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:06,705
He killed her.
- You freeze-dried her corpse?

175
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:08,607
- Alonso's reverse
thermogenesis.

176
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:10,942
But look...

177
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:13,378
She left this for a reason...

178
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,779
A message or a code.

179
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,081
I mean, at least
I thought that...

180
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,816
- no, no.
I know exactly what that is.

181
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:19,718
That's a locator number...

182
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,687
For a book in the library
at Brakebills.

183
00:10:37,903 --> 00:10:39,337
- Be careful.

184
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:41,940
That's a long
drop for human legs.

185
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:43,908
We would not want to see you
get hurt

186
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,212
so soon after being rebuilt.

187
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:49,247
- "Rebuilt"?

188
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,654
It's strange, I know.

189
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:56,921
But you'll get used to it.

190
00:10:56,923 --> 00:10:58,423
- Is this a hospital?

191
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:02,027
Are you... are you a doctor?
- You're at the retreat...

192
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:04,329
A few hours gallop north
of Whitespire.

193
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,431
I was a patient years ago.

194
00:11:06,433 --> 00:11:09,267
The centaurs saved my life
when no one else could.

195
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:12,337
Now I try to repay that debt
by serving them as a nurse.

196
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,839
- The centaurs?
- Mm-hmm.

197
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:16,207
- Horse people.

198
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:18,309
- Mm-hmm.
- How... how long have I...

199
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:22,213
- three weeks.
Your injuries were severe.

200
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:25,450
Your friends were called away,
but they left that for you.

201
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,422
We can start physical therapy
in the morning.

202
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,875
<i>- "Dear Q,</i>

203
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,444
<i>"we buried Alice today
in the gardens,</i>

204
00:11:52,446 --> 00:11:54,379
<i>"where she'll
always be close by.</i>

205
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:58,149
<i>"We left a box of her things,
if you ever wake up.</i>

206
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:00,285
<i>"Please wake up.</i>

207
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:03,722
<i>Your benevolent overlord,
high king Eliot."</i>

208
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,937
Hey.

209
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:25,276
- Margo sent me here
to get my hands checked out.

210
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:29,047
Look...

211
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,448
It sucks about Alice.

212
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,917
- "Sucks"?

213
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,319
That's the best that you can do?

214
00:12:34,321 --> 00:12:35,987
- I cared about her, too.

215
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:38,156
- For what, like, ten minutes,
including foreplay?

216
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:40,091
- Are you mad at me because
I cared too much or too little?

217
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,060
- I'm mad 'cause you fucked up
the one thing that

218
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:44,429
we were counting on you for.
- You want to blame me?

219
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,164
It was your cacodemon
that killed her.

220
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,433
- That was not Alice.
Alice was gone.

221
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:51,536
- So you just saved
the day, huh?

222
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:54,272
- Could we just...

223
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:57,108
Convalesce from our horrible
injuries separately, please?

224
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,181
- Nice to see you, too, man.

225
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:13,558
- Good day. My name is sawbones.
I'll be examining you.

226
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,062
Ugh!

227
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:20,064
Those are the most accursed
things I've ever smelled.

228
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:23,501
They must be removed posthaste.

229
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:25,136
How did they become cursed?

230
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,005
- Uh...

231
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:30,074
Some guy, this... this valet type
of dude at Chatwin's torrent.

232
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:32,343
- The river watcher.
- You know him?

233
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:34,279
- I'm sorry.
I-i can't help you.

234
00:13:34,281 --> 00:13:35,480
- Dude, just chop 'em off
and give me

235
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:37,248
some magic wooden shit
like you did Quentin.

236
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,350
- I'm a surgeon.
I can't risk the curse

237
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:40,552
spreading to my own hands.

238
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:42,554
The river watcher...

239
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:45,089
He's mercurial and dangerous.

240
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:49,527
You erred greatly
in offending him, penny.

241
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,531
- Did you...

242
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:57,602
Are you shitting?

243
00:13:57,604 --> 00:14:00,371
- You're welcome.

244
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:06,444
What was I saying?

245
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:08,379
- Me likey.

246
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:10,515
- You're thinking about
banging yourself, aren't you?

247
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:11,549
- Shh, shh, shh.

248
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:13,384
No, no.

249
00:14:13,386 --> 00:14:17,355
Doing your clone is more like
AP-level masturbation.

250
00:14:17,357 --> 00:14:20,191
- Ugh, put on a robe, would you?

251
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:28,266
- Aww.
- Now, part two...

252
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:30,568
A variation
on the mind-control work

253
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:33,204
Mayakovsky hammered us
with first year.

254
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:36,140
You sleep here, your mind
goes into the golem.

255
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:37,575
- And the golem
goes to Brakebills,

256
00:14:37,577 --> 00:14:39,410
unless, of course, we're wrong
about the fine print

257
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:42,247
in my contract and he can't
leave Fillory either.

258
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:44,482
- Yeah, totally possible
he touches a button

259
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:47,285
and just explodes.

260
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:50,188
Only one way to find out.

261
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,062
- Richard's alumni key.

262
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,198
It gets you past the wards
at Brakebills.

263
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,466
- I was expelled.

264
00:15:01,468 --> 00:15:03,401
Alarm bells will go off
the second I pop in.

265
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,602
- I didn't go to school there.

266
00:15:04,604 --> 00:15:06,504
I mean, how am I supposed
to find this book?

267
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:09,374
"Best bitches"?

268
00:15:09,376 --> 00:15:11,342
It's the only one
the bodega had.

269
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:35,566
<i>Okay, bitch, say something.</i>

270
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:43,141
- You seeing this?
- Head down this row.

271
00:15:43,143 --> 00:15:45,677
Wait. Yeah, that room
on your left.

272
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,512
<i>It's got an anti-decay charm
on it.</i>

273
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:49,681
<i>It's where they keep
the good shit.</i>

274
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,489
<i>- Got it.</i>
- What?

275
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:03,294
Wait, let me see.
Hold it up.

276
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:06,130
Wait, flip it to the back.

277
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:09,400
Damn it.
It's like a library lojack.

278
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:10,735
It'll go off if you try
to take the book

279
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:12,437
outside the Brakebills wards.

280
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:14,372
<i>- I mean, this will take hours
to copy.</i>

281
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:15,673
<i>Someone's gonna notice me.</i>

282
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:19,510
- Well, not if you know
the right place to hide.

283
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:31,723
- Okay.
Didn't explode so far.

284
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,727
Why does everything smell
so great?

285
00:16:35,729 --> 00:16:38,763
- Because your doppelganger
hasn't met cocaine yet.

286
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:43,434
Todd! Todd! Todd!
Todd! Todd! Todd!

287
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:46,337
- Why is everyone
cheering for...

288
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,307
Todd?
- Oh, hey.

289
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:51,676
You guys!

290
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,411
- You made a lot
of friends, huh?

291
00:16:53,413 --> 00:16:54,779
- I heard you guys were dead.

292
00:16:54,781 --> 00:16:58,683
So I threw this massive rager
in your honor.

293
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:01,285
- The fact that you just
called it a rager sickens me.

294
00:17:01,287 --> 00:17:04,555
- Thing is, it went great,

295
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:08,393
and everyone had so much fun
that I kind of...

296
00:17:08,395 --> 00:17:10,028
- Became the new me.

297
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,733
- Todd, answer truthfully.

298
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:17,535
Are you wearing my vest?

299
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:22,273
- I am wearing your vest.

300
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:23,708
- Keep it.

301
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,644
New plan...
I give up on Fillory

302
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:29,380
and dedicate myself completely
to destroying Todd.

303
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:32,316
- Oh, it's just Todd.
- "Just Todd"?

304
00:17:32,318 --> 00:17:34,752
He's usurping me.
My entire kingdom is at stake.

305
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:37,655
- Your actual kingdom
is actually at stake.

306
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:39,357
- There are some things
more important

307
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,525
than saving an entire world.

308
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:42,060
- Okay, I'm gonna go out
on a limb

309
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:45,063
and say this isn't really
about Todd.

310
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,667
- You don't say, Margo.

311
00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:52,403
- No killing Todd.

312
00:17:54,306 --> 00:17:55,740
Fucking Todd.

313
00:18:30,742 --> 00:18:32,743
- is this a bad time?

314
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,682
Come sit over here.

315
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:43,821
- I saw a-a... Strange woman.

316
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:47,425
She's... Pale and had...

317
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:49,293
Horn things.

318
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,662
- You've seen the white lady.

319
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:53,664
- I'm sorry.
"White lady?"

320
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:55,867
- You are fortunate
she offered herself

321
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:57,535
to some centaur's sight

322
00:18:57,537 --> 00:18:59,737
while you happened
to be watching.

323
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:09,380
- Is that...
- Mm, skin.

324
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:12,150
It won't feel,
but it might help you forget

325
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:13,651
what's underneath.

326
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,671
Get up, Coldwater!

327
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,339
- What... what happened?

328
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,542
- My hands tried to kill me,
so I broke my own arms.

329
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:39,644
Look, forget all the mean shit
I said to you earlier.

330
00:19:39,646 --> 00:19:42,547
The bronies can't fix me.
I need your help.

331
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:43,781
- Okay, I guess.

332
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:47,485
- First things first...
Find an ax.

333
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,257
- Are you sure about this?

334
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:55,393
- Do you know how strong
booze has to be

335
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:57,962
to get a horse drunk?

336
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:02,200
I c... I ca...
I can't feel my face,

337
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:04,468
much less my face...

338
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:08,372
I mean hands.

339
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:09,574
Just do it.

340
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:12,877
- I'm going to.
Jeez.

341
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:17,381
Nope.

342
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,483
- Damn it, Quentin!

343
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:21,385
- Sorry, I just... I panicked.
I don't love blood.

344
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:22,920
- Who loves blood?

345
00:20:22,922 --> 00:20:25,423
I'm not gonna feel anything,
so fucking go!

346
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:26,991
- I don't think I can do this.
- Oh, my god!

347
00:20:26,993 --> 00:20:28,559
I knew I fucking couldn't
count on you!

348
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:31,963
You are so fucking pathetic,
you... you... you floppy-haired,

349
00:20:31,965 --> 00:20:33,931
limp dicked dork.

350
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:36,434
Fucking... no wonder Alice
couldn't get off on you.

351
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:38,269
You have no fuck... aah!
- Aah!

352
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,870
- Oh, I fucking feel it!
- Okay, okay!

353
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:42,240
- Oh, what did you do?
- I can fix it! I can fix it!

354
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:55,286
- Oh, I wouldn't.

355
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:56,921
Todd made that.
It's vile.

356
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:05,596
Here.

357
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:10,268
Mmm.
Delicious.

358
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,504
- I'm Eliot.
- Javier.

359
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:15,973
- You're a first-year?

360
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:17,408
- Second-year.

361
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,577
<i>Universidad De Asombro</i> in Spain.

362
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:21,479
I'm here
for the welters tournament.

363
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:22,680
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

364
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:24,615
- I would make a joke
about ball handling,

365
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:27,718
but I'm deadly serious
about ball handling.

366
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,388
- Me too.
- Mm.

367
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,323
Listen, Javier, I could
keep this up all night...

368
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:34,659
- So could I.
- But I have to reclaim my title

369
00:21:34,661 --> 00:21:36,027
as the life of this
and every party

370
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:37,528
by making a drink so perfect...

371
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:41,666
- it seems like you need
to relax.

372
00:21:41,668 --> 00:21:43,634
- I'm married...

373
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:44,902
To a woman.

374
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:46,537
- I have a boyfriend.

375
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:49,040
But he's on another
continent, so...

376
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:51,542
It doesn't count.

377
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:54,312
And where is your wife?

378
00:21:54,314 --> 00:21:55,579
- On another planet.

379
00:21:55,581 --> 00:21:58,649
Definitely doesn't count.

380
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:12,496
- Ahh.
It's working.

381
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:13,664
<i>- ¿Qué?</i>

382
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:15,066
- Nothing.
Back at it.

383
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,706
Eliot?

384
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:25,042
Hey. You were talking
in your sleep.

385
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:26,777
- What... what did you do?

386
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:30,648
- I'm sorry. I get a little bit
enthusiastic sometimes.

387
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:31,716
I'll be gentle.

388
00:22:31,718 --> 00:22:33,417
- You've been in bed all day.

389
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,119
I came to check on you.

390
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:38,122
- I'm fine.
I'm f-f-fine.

391
00:22:38,124 --> 00:22:40,758
- Uh, are you sure
you still want...

392
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,393
- uh, i-i do.

393
00:22:42,395 --> 00:22:43,561
- What?
- I do...

394
00:22:43,563 --> 00:22:45,996
Want to tell you I'm sorry.

395
00:22:45,998 --> 00:22:48,499
I'm so sorry.
- For what?

396
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:49,633
- Um...

397
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:51,736
- I'm gonna go.

398
00:22:51,738 --> 00:22:53,671
- Um...

399
00:22:53,673 --> 00:22:55,806
No, no. No, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

400
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:57,808
I-i absolutely want
to have sex right now.

401
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,544
- You do?

402
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:03,013
- Yeah.

403
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,554
Ah...

404
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:14,125
This is interesting.

405
00:23:14,127 --> 00:23:16,060
Do you want me to stop?

406
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:18,763
- Uh...

407
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,423
- Good morning, Quentin.
- How's penny?

408
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:48,726
- He lost a lot of blood,
but he'll live.

409
00:23:48,728 --> 00:23:50,661
You're ready
for physical therapy.

410
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:53,497
Some calisthenics maybe
or core work?

411
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:55,699
- I had something else
in mind, actually.

412
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:33,471
- You're exactly as good with
a bow as you are with an ax.

413
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:36,507
Since I was a kid, the beast has
been whispering shit in my ear.

414
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:38,909
Now that he's dead, the world's
gotten a lot quieter...

415
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:41,512
Or would be
if not for you out here

416
00:24:41,514 --> 00:24:44,915
thinking low-self-esteem shit.

417
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:47,885
- I'll re-do my wards.

418
00:24:47,887 --> 00:24:50,120
- There's something
in the Declan text

419
00:24:50,122 --> 00:24:52,223
about making arrows
fly straight.

420
00:24:52,225 --> 00:24:53,591
- Show me.

421
00:24:53,593 --> 00:24:54,925
- If I had middle fingers,

422
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:56,660
you know what they'd be doing
right now?

423
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,562
Start with popper 31.

424
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:07,238
- Now cross your index
and ring fingers.

425
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,641
No, under the middle.

426
00:25:10,643 --> 00:25:13,544
Now slide the thumb
along the meridian.

427
00:25:13,546 --> 00:25:15,145
Now draw the arrow back.

428
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:24,688
- Thank you.
- Thank me by shutting up.

429
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,558
- There's a creature
called the white lady.

430
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,959
I saw her yesterday.

431
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:31,629
She's one of the seven
questing creatures of Fillory.

432
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:34,832
If you can catch her, she has
to give you whatever you ask.

433
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:36,867
Plover wrote about her,
called her the winter's Doe.

434
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,969
She lives in the darkling wood.

435
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:40,571
It's just past
the flying forest.

436
00:25:40,573 --> 00:25:43,607
It's not far from here.

437
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:45,142
We could hunt her together.

438
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:47,845
- "Let's go hunt
the white lady"?

439
00:25:47,847 --> 00:25:50,314
People like me get shot
for saying shit like that.

440
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:52,816
- She can give you
your hands back.

441
00:25:52,818 --> 00:25:54,885
- What's in it for you?

442
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:57,555
- I'm gonna ask her
to bring Alice back to life.

443
00:26:07,198 --> 00:26:10,701
- The river we crossed
was at the edge of it.

444
00:26:10,703 --> 00:26:14,104
So we're in the flying forest.

445
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:17,207
- What? Shouldn't the trees be,
like, flying and shit?

446
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:20,911
- Yeah, actually.
Most of them are crepuscular.

447
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:24,114
It means they're active
at dawn and dusk.

448
00:26:24,116 --> 00:26:26,116
- You smell that?

449
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:27,718
It smells like...

450
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,120
- Good.

451
00:26:30,122 --> 00:26:32,089
What is that?

452
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,124
- I don't know.

453
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:38,028
I Th... I think I'm...
I'm getting a contact high.

454
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:40,965
- Yeah. Definitely starting
to feel something.

455
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:44,835
Flying forest.

456
00:26:46,872 --> 00:26:48,238
- Oh, my god.

457
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,274
The Chatwins were, like, ten
when they came through here.

458
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:52,209
They must have been blazed
the entire time.

459
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:54,812
- Super inappropriate.

460
00:26:54,814 --> 00:26:56,280
- Hey, i-i take back
what I said.

461
00:26:56,282 --> 00:26:58,716
I-i fully expect
to see

462
00:26:58,718 --> 00:27:00,818
a tree flapping around
at any second.

463
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,087
- Listen, Quincy,
if we get a tree or...

464
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:05,823
- did you just call me Quincy?

465
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:11,128
- Is... is that not
your name?

466
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:16,934
Dude...

467
00:27:16,936 --> 00:27:18,869
Dude, what the fuck?

468
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:20,838
Get away from my mouth, man.
- It's my mouth.

469
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,272
- Uh...
- No, it's not.

470
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:24,074
- Oh.

471
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:26,677
Oh, where...
Uh, where...

472
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:27,911
Where are my stuff touchers?

473
00:27:27,913 --> 00:27:29,179
Aah! Ooh!

474
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:31,915
What the fuck is going on?

475
00:27:31,917 --> 00:27:35,185
Who the fuck are you?

476
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:38,055
Who am I?

477
00:27:38,057 --> 00:27:40,157
I have no idea.

478
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,060
Okay.

479
00:27:43,062 --> 00:27:47,197
The beast shit
in the wellspring.

480
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:49,733
- No. No.
Ember.

481
00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:52,236
Ember shat in the wellspring.

482
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:54,705
I think he meant well.

483
00:27:54,707 --> 00:27:56,306
He probably didn't know

484
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:58,976
how hard it would be
to clean out.

485
00:27:58,978 --> 00:28:03,347
- And now magic is failing
on earth...

486
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:04,982
Because of shit,

487
00:28:04,984 --> 00:28:07,184
proving once again
that comedy and tragedy

488
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,953
can coexist
in the same goddamn sentence.

489
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:15,225
Honestly...

490
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:17,027
I am in over my head.

491
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,863
I am not even in control
of which world

492
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:22,132
my body is awake in,
and my sexually aggressive wife,

493
00:28:22,134 --> 00:28:24,068
she could wake me up
at any moment in Fillory.

494
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:26,236
- Eliot, there are certain
student/teacher boundaries

495
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:28,305
which I'd prefer not to cross.

496
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:30,174
- So what am I supposed
to do, Henry?

497
00:28:30,176 --> 00:28:31,975
- What did you think
was going to happen

498
00:28:31,977 --> 00:28:34,878
when you dove headfirst
into another world?

499
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:43,053
- I thought I'd die.

500
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,089
- But you didn't.

501
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:47,891
Now you have two lives.

502
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:49,126
You're trying to live both.

503
00:28:49,128 --> 00:28:51,261
- Yes.
- Yes, but you can't.

504
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:53,130
That's stupid.

505
00:28:53,132 --> 00:28:54,932
You can let it tear you in half

506
00:28:54,934 --> 00:28:57,267
or pick one.

507
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:59,103
- I can never leave Fillory.

508
00:28:59,105 --> 00:29:01,105
- The choice is easy.

509
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:05,175
- I am...

510
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:07,277
Ill-equipped to be a king.

511
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,880
- I am no better equipped
to teach one.

512
00:29:09,882 --> 00:29:13,951
Being an adult is recognizing
your responsibilities.

513
00:29:13,953 --> 00:29:17,855
A bunch of my students went
and conquered another world.

514
00:29:17,857 --> 00:29:19,790
- They more, like,
gave it to us.

515
00:29:19,792 --> 00:29:22,059
- Either way,
it doesn't look great for me.

516
00:29:22,061 --> 00:29:24,995
It reeks of earth privilege.

517
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:27,231
The very least I can do is...

518
00:29:27,233 --> 00:29:28,832
Is to help you rule it.

519
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:33,137
- What do you have in mind?

520
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:35,439
- Bring in
the best minds we can...

521
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:37,975
Historians, politicians,

522
00:29:37,977 --> 00:29:41,879
shamans, military leaders.

523
00:29:41,881 --> 00:29:46,283
Hmm.
Your thesis project is...

524
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:49,953
"How to save
an entire goddamn world."

525
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:02,966
- Right or left?

526
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:06,270
- Right seems to be
the popular direction.

527
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,910
- I must be an adventurer.

528
00:30:12,912 --> 00:30:15,078
No, you're not.

529
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,047
- What?
I have a bow and arrow

530
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:20,984
and a cool questing outfit
and a manservant.

531
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:24,154
- Oh-ho-ho, you did not
just say that, white boy.

532
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:28,292
Besides, what kind of servant
has no fucking hands?

533
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,399
- Right or left?

534
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:37,901
- Right seems to be
the popular direction.

535
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:46,176
Julia?

536
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:49,479
What the hell
are you doing here?

537
00:30:49,481 --> 00:30:51,348
- Look, I can explain.
- No.

538
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,350
After you jumped in and screwed
everything up with penny,

539
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:56,320
Alice died killing
your little friend Martin.

540
00:30:56,322 --> 00:30:59,156
Then Quentin was almost
ripped in half.

541
00:30:59,158 --> 00:31:01,491
And you have the balls
to come here.

542
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:03,060
- Look, if you guys
had trusted me,

543
00:31:03,062 --> 00:31:04,494
both Reynard and the beast
would be dead.

544
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:06,330
None of that
would have happened.

545
00:31:06,332 --> 00:31:08,265
- Quentin should have left you
in your little hedge hole,

546
00:31:08,267 --> 00:31:10,500
trading rim jobs for spells.

547
00:31:10,502 --> 00:31:13,303
- You actually think because
you go to this bullshit school

548
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:15,005
that you're better than me.

549
00:31:15,007 --> 00:31:17,908
- I think I didn't get
my friends killed.

550
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,943
- You don't have friends.

551
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:22,112
You have people
that are so afraid of you,

552
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:24,448
they'd rather be on your side.

553
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:28,418
There's a difference.

554
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:31,154
- Well...

555
00:31:31,156 --> 00:31:34,024
And you have no one.

556
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:35,926
And you deserve no one.

557
00:31:35,928 --> 00:31:37,294
- Look,
I don't expect you to care

558
00:31:37,296 --> 00:31:39,129
'cause this doesn't directly
affect your hair

559
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:42,099
or your social life,
but since you let Reynard free,

560
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:44,034
he has murdered
over a dozen women,

561
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:46,303
and this book might be
my last shot at killing him.

562
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:01,151
- The book's blank.

563
00:32:01,153 --> 00:32:04,121
Put yours in the box
and wait for them to mate.

564
00:32:04,123 --> 00:32:07,491
The baby should be a pretty
decent xerox of the original.

565
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,147
- You know what this is?

566
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:32,149
Ooh, this is a girl's.

567
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:38,422
What if I'm supposed to be
rescuing her?

568
00:32:38,424 --> 00:32:41,491
- Ooh, or what if
you're a stalker?

569
00:32:41,493 --> 00:32:43,493
- Right or left?

570
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:49,499
- Right seems to be
the popular direction.

571
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:51,969
- Wait, no.

572
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:54,504
If I'm supposed
to find her, I...

573
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:57,507
I have to look
where no one else is searching.

574
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:59,509
- What?

575
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,292
- Penny.

576
00:33:15,294 --> 00:33:18,195
Douche bag.

577
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:23,734
The effect of the weed forest
is wearing off.

578
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,739
- Oh, my god.

579
00:33:32,277 --> 00:33:35,245
It's Alice. Uh...

580
00:33:36,314 --> 00:33:38,782
- Quentin, look, I...

581
00:33:38,784 --> 00:33:42,619
I know how you feel, man.

582
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:46,757
Before, when your wards
were slipping, I...

583
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:49,292
I know.

584
00:33:51,462 --> 00:33:54,564
- I can't.
- No, hey, no, no. Listen.

585
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:57,267
You... you can't...

586
00:33:57,269 --> 00:34:00,037
You can't puss out right now.

587
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:02,506
Think about Alice.
She needs you, man.

588
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:06,743
I need you.

589
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:18,221
- Hey.

590
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,589
- Hey.

591
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:21,758
- So I've been thinking.

592
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,729
Is 100 feet really tall enough
for Alice's memorial?

593
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:28,698
- We weren't her friends,
remember?

594
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:38,742
- We owe it to her...

595
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:41,511
Because we weren't her friends.

596
00:34:45,616 --> 00:34:48,351
- We don't have the money.

597
00:34:48,353 --> 00:34:51,288
- We're magicians.

598
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,623
Let's build it ourselves.

599
00:34:55,526 --> 00:34:58,762
- Look, what Margo said
about me was true.

600
00:34:58,764 --> 00:35:02,365
So if... if you want to bail,
now's your chance.

601
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:05,602
- Well, you do have
questionable judgment.

602
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:08,705
I mean,
we're best bitches, right?

603
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:10,674
For better or for worse.

604
00:35:10,676 --> 00:35:11,842
- God.

605
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,413
- Wait a minute.

606
00:35:16,415 --> 00:35:18,415
I know why marina
wanted me to find the book.

607
00:35:18,417 --> 00:35:20,750
- Why?
- It's a necromancy spell.

608
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:24,554
- As in bring back to life?

609
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:26,289
No, no fucking way.

610
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:28,658
- Kady...
- She killed my mother.

611
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,660
- Look, the effects
are unstable.

612
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:33,830
It'll only last a few minutes,
and then she goes away again.

613
00:35:33,832 --> 00:35:35,465
- Fine.

614
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:39,603
Fine.
Let's defrost the bitch.

615
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:48,311
It says the last ingredient
is the book itself.

616
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:50,313
- Then we got one chance.

617
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:06,596
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

618
00:36:06,598 --> 00:36:07,931
It's okay.
It's okay.

619
00:36:07,933 --> 00:36:09,833
My skin is so cold.

620
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:11,735
- It's okay. Look at me, please.
- You... you brought me back...

621
00:36:11,737 --> 00:36:13,470
- you had a message
you wanted to tell me.

622
00:36:13,472 --> 00:36:15,705
- I'm gonna die.
- We don't have that much time.

623
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:17,707
- You don't understand.
You don't know where I was.

624
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:19,843
I don't want to go back there.
I don't want to go back there.

625
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:21,645
- Marina, your clock
is running out, okay?

626
00:36:21,647 --> 00:36:23,680
Please, you are the strongest
person that I have ever met.

627
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,448
I need you to pull it
together now,

628
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:26,850
and I need you to tell me.

629
00:36:26,852 --> 00:36:30,554
- I need you to tell me
about the thing that killed you.

630
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:35,192
You can stop him, Julia.

631
00:36:35,194 --> 00:36:38,495
It is possible,
but you need to do it.

632
00:36:38,497 --> 00:36:40,897
You need to do it.
- Okay, what?

633
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:42,599
What do I need to do?

634
00:36:42,601 --> 00:36:45,602
- There was... A girl.

635
00:36:45,604 --> 00:36:49,739
40 years ago,
she banished Reynard from earth.

636
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:51,875
That's where he was
until you summoned him.

637
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:54,778
That's where he was
until you brought him back.

638
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:57,647
I'm sorr... I'm sorry.

639
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:19,836
- Shh.

640
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:59,442
- Hi.

641
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,945
Don't run.

642
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:03,980
Are you gonna?

643
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:08,051
- What's the deal?

644
00:38:08,053 --> 00:38:12,022
- I don't know.
She's kind of ignoring me.

645
00:38:12,024 --> 00:38:14,524
- Yo, white lady, we caught you.

646
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:18,495
- Hey, show some respect.

647
00:38:18,497 --> 00:38:22,432
- Pardon me...
Miss lady?

648
00:38:22,434 --> 00:38:24,301
- It hurts.

649
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:26,970
- Uh, sorry.
Uh...

650
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:28,471
- Why have you come?

651
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:29,806
- That's my arrow.

652
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,408
You have to give me what I ask.

653
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:34,744
- Obviously, you turd.

654
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:43,320
Look at you.

655
00:38:43,322 --> 00:38:47,090
Someone's been rebuilt...

656
00:38:47,092 --> 00:38:49,326
And so cleverly.

657
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:57,434
Mm.

658
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,837
Feel that?

659
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,441
- Could you not?

660
00:39:04,443 --> 00:39:06,476
- Here's a riddle.

661
00:39:06,478 --> 00:39:07,944
How much do you have to lose

662
00:39:07,946 --> 00:39:10,480
before you're no longer
yourself?

663
00:39:10,482 --> 00:39:12,449
- I don't know.
Why don't you tell me?

664
00:39:12,451 --> 00:39:14,484
- What is it, Quentin Coldwater,

665
00:39:14,486 --> 00:39:16,119
that you ache for?

666
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:18,088
You have a crown

667
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:21,858
and the power to reshape
the very ether to your whim.

668
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,428
What else could you
possibly want?

669
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:29,132
- Um, technically speaking,
uh, we both caught you, so...

670
00:39:29,134 --> 00:39:31,368
- Shut up. I'll ask for your
thing with my third wish.

671
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:34,003
- No.
We each get a wish,

672
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:36,840
and then we have one
mutually agreeable third wish.

673
00:39:36,842 --> 00:39:38,875
- You can each have one wish,
or you can fuck off.

674
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:40,076
- Okay.

675
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:45,548
Alice Quinn...

676
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:48,818
Bring her back to life...

677
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:53,957
Please.

678
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:56,459
- I can't.

679
00:39:56,461 --> 00:39:58,595
- What do you mean you can't?

680
00:39:58,597 --> 00:40:01,898
You are not the only magical
creature in this fucking forest.

681
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,400
- True.

682
00:40:03,402 --> 00:40:05,502
And we all have limits.

683
00:40:05,504 --> 00:40:07,604
We can give you anything.

684
00:40:07,606 --> 00:40:10,039
But we cannot Pierce that veil.

685
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:12,041
Alice is gone.

686
00:40:20,618 --> 00:40:24,087
- My turn.

687
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:25,955
I want my hands back.

688
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:27,424
- That I can do.

689
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:37,967
No!

690
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:41,070
- What did you do to him?

691
00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:43,206
- That screaming was irritating.

692
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:45,475
He'll wake when he's healed.

693
00:40:45,477 --> 00:40:48,511
Now, I can't nap
until I've granted your wish.

694
00:40:48,513 --> 00:40:50,847
- I'd like to be happy.
Could you do that?

695
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:53,216
- I can do wonders.

696
00:40:53,218 --> 00:40:55,518
But you should know...

697
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:59,956
There's nothing I can give you
that will soothe your shade.

698
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:02,992
There's only
what I can take away.

699
00:41:02,994 --> 00:41:05,495
- You'd take away
my memories of Alice?

700
00:41:05,497 --> 00:41:08,198
- Yes.
I would free you completely.

701
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:13,703
- No.

702
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:17,474
- You are wiser than you appear.

703
00:41:17,476 --> 00:41:20,643
You would find your way
back to sadness,

704
00:41:20,645 --> 00:41:23,012
no matter how far
you run from it.

705
00:41:23,014 --> 00:41:25,548
- Well, that's comforting.

706
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:29,219
- Is there nothing else
you desire?

707
00:41:29,221 --> 00:41:33,122
- Everything I've ever wanted,
I've got.

708
00:41:33,124 --> 00:41:37,060
Magic is real, and it can fix
anything except what I need.

709
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:41,197
I loved a girl.

710
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:47,136
My entire life...
I've dreamed of Fillory,

711
00:41:47,138 --> 00:41:50,573
that I would be like
Martin Chatwin.

712
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:52,942
I'd find a way
to stay here forever.

713
00:42:02,153 --> 00:42:04,587
Send me home.
