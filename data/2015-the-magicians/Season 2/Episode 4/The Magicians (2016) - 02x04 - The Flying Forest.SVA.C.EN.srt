1
00:00:00,037 --> 00:00:02,532
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:04,356 --> 00:00:06,637
- No, no, no.
- Don't you fucking touch her.

3
00:00:06,672 --> 00:00:08,472
Fine, I'll take you first.

4
00:00:08,507 --> 00:00:10,173
No!
No.

5
00:00:12,778 --> 00:00:14,544
Now!

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,511
- Julia.
- Move!

7
00:00:16,631 --> 00:00:18,048
Wait.

8
00:00:18,083 --> 00:00:21,145
I had Reynard.
I had The Beast.

9
00:00:21,265 --> 00:00:23,006
Man, fuck this.
We're out.

10
00:00:25,477 --> 00:00:27,344
The chain was the only thing
keeping my hand from--

11
00:00:27,379 --> 00:00:30,547
Sorry.
Not my problem.

12
00:00:30,582 --> 00:00:32,115
Do you know what a Niffin is?

13
00:00:32,151 --> 00:00:33,383
It's when too much
runs through you,

14
00:00:33,418 --> 00:00:34,484
<i>consumes you.</i>

15
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:36,386
<i>Only the magic is left.</i>

16
00:00:36,421 --> 00:00:41,224
Hard to cast
when you're sliced in two.

17
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:45,128
What is she doing?

18
00:00:45,164 --> 00:00:47,230
She can't.
She'll Niffin out.

19
00:00:47,266 --> 00:00:48,632
Alice, stop.

20
00:00:51,136 --> 00:00:55,172
Let's finally finish this.

21
00:00:55,207 --> 00:00:57,174
He did it on purpose.

22
00:01:01,647 --> 00:01:05,515
Alice, don't.

23
00:01:43,088 --> 00:01:46,256
- Five surgeries.
- He'll recover.

24
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:48,525
I know we're being serious
right now,

25
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,528
but that surgeon
has the biggest dick.

26
00:01:56,768 --> 00:01:59,769
Eliot, it's time to go.

27
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,373
Our kingdom awaits.

28
00:02:11,817 --> 00:02:14,851
With The Beast dead, there's
a power vacuum in Fillory.

29
00:02:14,887 --> 00:02:16,453
Power vacuum?

30
00:02:16,488 --> 00:02:19,155
Hello?
High King and Queen right here.

31
00:02:19,191 --> 00:02:22,292
We, of course, recognize your
rule, but others--

32
00:02:22,327 --> 00:02:24,094
Everyone assumes
you'll be dead soon...

33
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:27,864
or you'll run away
or vanish or go mad.

34
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,466
There are stirrings of rebellion

35
00:02:29,501 --> 00:02:31,368
in the Southern Orchard,
the Outer Islands,

36
00:02:31,403 --> 00:02:33,303
refusal to pay
the Crown's taxes.

37
00:02:33,338 --> 00:02:35,538
You know who loves paying taxes?

38
00:02:35,574 --> 00:02:37,440
People with broken legs.

39
00:02:39,311 --> 00:02:40,677
Abigail would remind you

40
00:02:40,712 --> 00:02:42,812
that money cannot fill
the Wellspring.

41
00:02:42,848 --> 00:02:44,481
Without it, Fillory withers.

42
00:02:44,516 --> 00:02:46,516
Okay, well,
we talked about this.

43
00:02:46,551 --> 00:02:48,485
When someone drops a log
at a public pool,

44
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,687
you just send a kid with a net
to fish it out.

45
00:02:50,722 --> 00:02:54,658
The befouling
was substantial, Your Majesty.

46
00:02:54,693 --> 00:02:56,593
We've employed
several filtration systems,

47
00:02:56,628 --> 00:02:59,296
but the Wellspring
isn't recovering fast enough.

48
00:02:59,331 --> 00:03:01,598
If there was a royal appeal
to Ember himself--

49
00:03:01,633 --> 00:03:03,466
Okay, we can't find him.

50
00:03:03,502 --> 00:03:06,336
He's not in his temple
or his filthy sex cave.

51
00:03:06,371 --> 00:03:07,771
We need to devote
more resources.

52
00:03:07,806 --> 00:03:09,205
We're going to build a monument

53
00:03:09,241 --> 00:03:10,640
to our fallen queen--

54
00:03:10,676 --> 00:03:13,276
a statue, I think...

55
00:03:13,312 --> 00:03:14,678
100 feet high.

56
00:03:14,713 --> 00:03:16,212
Do you know
what that would cost?

57
00:03:16,248 --> 00:03:18,214
I don't care how much it costs.

58
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,817
I want designs drawn up
and funds...

59
00:03:20,852 --> 00:03:24,220
funded immediately.

60
00:03:24,256 --> 00:03:27,657
Can you give us a moment?

61
00:03:27,693 --> 00:03:30,660
I said get the fuck out.

62
00:03:37,235 --> 00:03:38,735
So that's the plan, huh--

63
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,204
blow all our cash
on sappy nonsense,

64
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:42,372
bankrupt the kingdom?

65
00:03:42,407 --> 00:03:43,907
We have to do something.

66
00:03:43,942 --> 00:03:45,275
Alice was our friend.

67
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,777
No. She wasn't.

68
00:03:47,813 --> 00:03:50,914
Alice was a package deal.
She came with Quentin.

69
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:52,949
Somebody skipped her colonic
this morning.

70
00:03:52,985 --> 00:03:55,819
For whatever stupid reason,

71
00:03:55,854 --> 00:03:59,389
you're the High King
of an entire land.

72
00:03:59,424 --> 00:04:01,291
You have to be
responsible, Eliot.

73
00:04:01,326 --> 00:04:02,859
Since when are you
Fillory Clinton?

74
00:04:02,894 --> 00:04:05,195
Since I'm me.

75
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,865
My crown is just as heavy
as yours.

76
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,534
You can leave
whenever you feel like it.

77
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,269
You can go back to Brakebills.

78
00:04:13,305 --> 00:04:16,306
You can do whatever
you goddamn want.

79
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:21,344
I don't belong here.

80
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,946
I'm not ready to be a king.

81
00:04:22,981 --> 00:04:26,716
I wasn't done being me.

82
00:04:26,752 --> 00:04:28,852
It was so much simpler
when there was just

83
00:04:28,887 --> 00:04:32,589
one giant evil dick
trying to kill us.

84
00:04:32,624 --> 00:04:35,425
- Now we're just--
- Grown-ups.

85
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,596
How did this happen?

86
00:04:39,631 --> 00:04:41,865
I have an idea...
to help you.

87
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,801
- Like a loophole?
- Mm-hmm.

88
00:04:50,042 --> 00:04:52,976
You're gonna ironically
abandon me here to go find it.

89
00:04:53,011 --> 00:04:54,978
I'll be back.
I promise.

90
00:04:57,582 --> 00:04:59,616
I know you...

91
00:04:59,651 --> 00:05:01,418
Will.

92
00:05:07,235 --> 00:05:15,235
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny

93
00:05:31,817 --> 00:05:34,617
Hey.

94
00:05:34,653 --> 00:05:37,821
Kady?

95
00:05:37,856 --> 00:05:39,022
Hey.

96
00:05:40,692 --> 00:05:43,460
Kady, come on, I need your help.

97
00:05:45,931 --> 00:05:47,931
Let's go.

98
00:06:11,423 --> 00:06:13,890
You haven't had any other
problems with your casting?

99
00:06:13,925 --> 00:06:16,059
I've had nothing but problems.

100
00:06:16,094 --> 00:06:17,727
I thought it was because
of my hands,

101
00:06:17,762 --> 00:06:20,730
but it's getting worse,
not better.

102
00:06:20,765 --> 00:06:23,500
Hmm.

103
00:06:23,535 --> 00:06:27,804
I've had a few...
brownouts, you could call them.

104
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,340
I mean, I thought it was
the Xanax, honestly.

105
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,741
How many?

106
00:06:31,776 --> 00:06:34,644
Two a day if I can get them.

107
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:36,079
Oh, you mean the brownouts.

108
00:06:36,114 --> 00:06:38,414
Four or five.

109
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,582
Hmm.

110
00:06:42,988 --> 00:06:44,954
Yes.

111
00:06:53,498 --> 00:06:55,598
What happened?

112
00:06:55,634 --> 00:06:57,500
I'm trying to get back here,
but my aim's off.

113
00:06:57,536 --> 00:06:59,836
Okay, all right, It seems like
more than your aim.

114
00:06:59,871 --> 00:07:01,111
Last three worlds I've been in

115
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:02,906
haven't had any fucking oxygen.

116
00:07:02,941 --> 00:07:05,742
My fingers just--they just--
they just keep shorting me out.

117
00:07:08,446 --> 00:07:11,047
What happened?
Did we kill The Beast?

118
00:07:11,082 --> 00:07:13,049
We did.

119
00:07:14,553 --> 00:07:19,422
But, um, Quentin's
pretty banged up.

120
00:07:19,457 --> 00:07:22,025
Alice was hurt
a lot worse, Penny.

121
00:07:24,596 --> 00:07:27,463
She--she died.

122
00:07:36,474 --> 00:07:39,742
- Budget?
- Citizen petitions.

123
00:07:39,778 --> 00:07:43,146
I want everyone
to stop wanting things.

124
00:07:43,181 --> 00:07:46,983
Great time to ask for something?

125
00:07:47,018 --> 00:07:49,118
Your father makes knives
for a living

126
00:07:49,154 --> 00:07:50,820
and knows where I sleep, so...

127
00:07:50,855 --> 00:07:53,089
Ask away.

128
00:07:55,093 --> 00:07:58,494
I'm know I'm not precisely
the type

129
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,597
you'd most likely choose,

130
00:08:00,632 --> 00:08:04,801
and I wasn't so experienced
when we were first together,

131
00:08:04,836 --> 00:08:06,169
but you're so great at it.

132
00:08:06,204 --> 00:08:09,105
You're--you're huge,
and it's so good.

133
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,909
And, Eliot, I don't know how
to politely ask you to fuck me.

134
00:08:15,013 --> 00:08:17,080
Oh, look, Margo's here.

135
00:08:17,115 --> 00:08:18,881
You remember Lasaro?

136
00:08:18,917 --> 00:08:20,450
That creep who made
the Margolem?

137
00:08:20,485 --> 00:08:22,619
I twisted his arms
and/or balls a little,

138
00:08:22,654 --> 00:08:24,687
and he gave up the spell.

139
00:08:24,723 --> 00:08:26,022
Living clay is hard to come by,

140
00:08:26,057 --> 00:08:28,691
but Fogg left his stash
so unprotected,

141
00:08:28,727 --> 00:08:30,994
it's like
he wanted me to steal it.

142
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:33,663
So I did.

143
00:08:33,698 --> 00:08:35,832
We're gonna make another you.

144
00:08:42,207 --> 00:08:43,706
Hey.

145
00:08:43,742 --> 00:08:46,676
Made you a sandwich...
half an hour ago.

146
00:08:46,711 --> 00:08:48,645
Then I ate it.

147
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,480
I'm sorry.

148
00:08:50,515 --> 00:08:53,049
It's been a long time
since I've had a hot shower.

149
00:08:53,084 --> 00:08:54,217
How you feeling?

150
00:08:54,252 --> 00:08:56,252
Uh...

151
00:08:56,288 --> 00:08:58,054
Better...

152
00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:00,890
nap, seeing you alive,

153
00:09:00,925 --> 00:09:03,693
magic methadone...

154
00:09:03,728 --> 00:09:06,929
methadone.

155
00:09:06,965 --> 00:09:08,731
Thanks...

156
00:09:08,767 --> 00:09:11,534
for all of it.

157
00:09:11,569 --> 00:09:15,571
So, um, how did you find me?

158
00:09:15,607 --> 00:09:17,874
After asking around a bit,
I heard about a girl

159
00:09:17,909 --> 00:09:20,009
who was doing miracles
for a quick fix.

160
00:09:20,045 --> 00:09:22,245
I called it
"turning tricks."

161
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,970
You think I'm judging you,
I'm not.

162
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,552
No.
No, I'm judging myself.

163
00:09:27,987 --> 00:09:31,387
You... you saved my life,

164
00:09:31,507 --> 00:09:32,704
and...

165
00:09:34,117 --> 00:09:37,504
you know, I-I thought
it would be okay to run...

166
00:09:38,348 --> 00:09:40,581
if I got the cavalry
and I came back to help you,

167
00:09:40,617 --> 00:09:42,450
but I...

168
00:09:42,485 --> 00:09:46,187
I just ran.

169
00:09:46,222 --> 00:09:48,222
I hid.

170
00:09:48,258 --> 00:09:52,360
Yeah, well, there was nothing
you could have done then.

171
00:09:52,395 --> 00:09:56,097
But you can help me now.

172
00:09:56,132 --> 00:09:58,432
Oh, my God.

173
00:09:58,468 --> 00:10:01,002
- Ju--Julia, is that--
- Marina.

174
00:10:01,037 --> 00:10:03,571
She helped me bait a trap
for Reynard.

175
00:10:03,606 --> 00:10:06,207
- He killed her.
- You freeze-dried her corpse?

176
00:10:06,242 --> 00:10:08,075
Alonso's Reverse Thermogenesis.

177
00:10:08,111 --> 00:10:10,478
But look...

178
00:10:10,513 --> 00:10:13,047
she left this for a reason--

179
00:10:13,082 --> 00:10:14,248
a message or a code.

180
00:10:14,284 --> 00:10:15,683
I mean, at least
I thought that--

181
00:10:15,718 --> 00:10:17,318
No, no.
I know exactly what that is.

182
00:10:17,353 --> 00:10:19,220
That's a locator number...

183
00:10:19,255 --> 00:10:22,123
for a book in the library
at Brakebills.

184
00:10:36,756 --> 00:10:38,289
Be careful.

185
00:10:38,324 --> 00:10:40,792
That's a long
drop for human legs.

186
00:10:40,827 --> 00:10:42,760
We would not want to see you
get hurt

187
00:10:42,796 --> 00:10:46,130
so soon after being rebuilt.

188
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,166
"Rebuilt"?

189
00:10:52,072 --> 00:10:54,605
It's strange, I know.

190
00:10:54,641 --> 00:10:55,773
But you'll get used to it.

191
00:10:55,809 --> 00:10:57,575
Is this a hospital?

192
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:00,878
- Are you--are you a doctor?
- You're at the retreat...

193
00:11:00,914 --> 00:11:03,281
a few hours gallop north
of Whitespire.

194
00:11:03,316 --> 00:11:05,583
I was a patient years ago.

195
00:11:05,618 --> 00:11:08,186
The Centaurs saved my life
when no one else could.

196
00:11:08,221 --> 00:11:11,255
Now I try to repay that debt
by serving them as a nurse.

197
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,658
- The Centaurs?
- Mm-hmm.

198
00:11:13,693 --> 00:11:15,093
Horse people.

199
00:11:15,128 --> 00:11:17,195
- Mm-hmm.
- How--how long have I--

200
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:21,099
Three weeks.
Your injuries were severe.

201
00:11:21,134 --> 00:11:24,635
Your friends were called away,
but they left that for you.

202
00:11:27,107 --> 00:11:29,373
We can start physical therapy
in the morning.

203
00:11:48,228 --> 00:11:49,694
<i>"Dear Q,</i>

204
00:11:49,729 --> 00:11:51,395
<i>"we buried Alice today
in the gardens,</i>

205
00:11:51,431 --> 00:11:53,331
<i>"where she'll
always be close by.</i>

206
00:11:53,366 --> 00:11:57,034
<i>"We left a box of her things,
if you ever wake up.</i>

207
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,203
<i>"Please wake up.</i>

208
00:11:59,239 --> 00:12:02,673
<i>Your benevolent overlord,
High King Eliot."</i>

209
00:12:15,388 --> 00:12:17,755
Hey.

210
00:12:20,126 --> 00:12:24,195
Margo sent me here
to get my hands checked out.

211
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:27,899
Look...

212
00:12:27,934 --> 00:12:29,400
it sucks about Alice.

213
00:12:29,435 --> 00:12:31,736
"Sucks"?

214
00:12:31,771 --> 00:12:33,204
That's the best that you can do?

215
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:34,805
I cared about her, too.

216
00:12:34,841 --> 00:12:37,008
For what, like, ten minutes,
including foreplay?

217
00:12:37,043 --> 00:12:38,943
Are you mad at me because
I cared too much or too little?

218
00:12:38,978 --> 00:12:40,912
I'm mad 'cause you fucked up
the one thing that

219
00:12:40,947 --> 00:12:43,381
- we were counting on you for.
- You want to blame me?

220
00:12:43,416 --> 00:12:45,016
It was your cacodemon
that killed her.

221
00:12:45,051 --> 00:12:47,385
That was not Alice.
Alice was gone.

222
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,688
So you just saved the day, huh?

223
00:12:50,723 --> 00:12:53,157
Could we just...

224
00:12:53,193 --> 00:12:56,194
convalesce from our horrible
injuries separately, please?

225
00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:02,066
Nice to see you, too, man.

226
00:13:09,475 --> 00:13:12,743
Good day. My name is Sawbones.
I'll be examining you.

227
00:13:15,048 --> 00:13:16,847
Ugh!

228
00:13:16,883 --> 00:13:18,916
Those are the most accursed
things I've ever smelled.

229
00:13:18,952 --> 00:13:22,453
They must be removed posthaste.

230
00:13:22,488 --> 00:13:23,988
How did they become cursed?

231
00:13:24,023 --> 00:13:25,823
Uh...

232
00:13:25,858 --> 00:13:28,893
Some guy, this--this valet type
of dude at Chatwin's Torrent.

233
00:13:28,928 --> 00:13:31,195
- The River Watcher.
- You know him?

234
00:13:31,231 --> 00:13:33,164
I'm sorry.
I-I can't help you.

235
00:13:33,199 --> 00:13:34,432
Dude, just chop 'em off
and give me

236
00:13:34,467 --> 00:13:36,133
some magic wooden shit
like you did Quentin.

237
00:13:36,169 --> 00:13:38,269
I'm a surgeon.
I can't risk the curse

238
00:13:38,304 --> 00:13:39,503
spreading to my own hands.

239
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:41,505
The River Watcher...

240
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,908
He's mercurial and dangerous.

241
00:13:43,943 --> 00:13:48,479
You erred greatly
in offending him, Penny.

242
00:13:50,817 --> 00:13:52,450
Did you--

243
00:13:52,485 --> 00:13:56,754
Are you shitting?

244
00:13:56,789 --> 00:13:59,290
You're welcome.

245
00:14:02,128 --> 00:14:05,363
What was I saying?

246
00:14:05,398 --> 00:14:07,265
Me likey.

247
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,433
You're thinking about
banging yourself, aren't you?

248
00:14:09,469 --> 00:14:10,501
Shh, shh, shh.

249
00:14:10,536 --> 00:14:12,270
No, no.

250
00:14:12,305 --> 00:14:16,240
Doing your clone is more like
AP-level masturbation.

251
00:14:16,276 --> 00:14:19,043
Ugh, put on a robe, would you?

252
00:14:24,317 --> 00:14:27,151
- Aww.
- Now, part two--

253
00:14:27,186 --> 00:14:29,520
a variation
on the mind-control work

254
00:14:29,555 --> 00:14:32,056
Mayakovsky hammered us
with first year.

255
00:14:32,091 --> 00:14:34,959
You sleep here, your mind
goes into the golem.

256
00:14:34,994 --> 00:14:36,527
And the golem
goes to Brakebills,

257
00:14:36,562 --> 00:14:38,329
unless, of course, we're wrong
about the fine print

258
00:14:38,364 --> 00:14:41,098
in my contract and he can't
leave Fillory either.

259
00:14:41,134 --> 00:14:43,401
Yeah, totally possible
he touches a button

260
00:14:43,436 --> 00:14:46,170
and just explodes.

261
00:14:46,205 --> 00:14:49,006
Only one way to find out.

262
00:14:55,315 --> 00:14:56,881
Richard's alumni key.

263
00:14:56,916 --> 00:14:59,050
It gets you past the wards
at Brakebills.

264
00:14:59,085 --> 00:15:00,451
I was expelled.

265
00:15:00,486 --> 00:15:02,286
Alarm bells will go off
the second I pop in.

266
00:15:02,322 --> 00:15:03,554
I didn't go to school there.

267
00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:05,423
I mean, how am I supposed
to find this book?

268
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:08,259
"Best bitches"?

269
00:15:08,294 --> 00:15:10,227
It's the only one
the bodega had.

270
00:15:31,417 --> 00:15:34,518
<i>Okay, bitch, say something.</i>

271
00:15:37,023 --> 00:15:41,959
- You seeing this?
- Head down this row.

272
00:15:41,994 --> 00:15:44,628
Wait. Yeah, that room
on your left.

273
00:15:44,664 --> 00:15:46,430
<i>It's got an anti-decay charm
on it.</i>

274
00:15:46,466 --> 00:15:48,632
<i>It's where they keep
the good shit.</i>

275
00:15:54,607 --> 00:15:57,375
<i>- Got it.</i>
- What?

276
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:02,146
Wait, let me see.
Hold it up.

277
00:16:02,181 --> 00:16:04,949
Wait, flip it to the back.

278
00:16:04,984 --> 00:16:08,285
Damn it.
It's like a library LoJack.

279
00:16:08,321 --> 00:16:09,887
It'll go off if you try
to take the book

280
00:16:09,922 --> 00:16:11,322
outside the Brakebills wards.

281
00:16:11,357 --> 00:16:13,224
<i>I mean, this will take hours
to copy.</i>

282
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:14,625
<i>Someone's gonna notice me.</i>

283
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:18,429
Well, not if you know
the right place to hide.

284
00:16:27,273 --> 00:16:30,674
Okay.
Didn't explode so far.

285
00:16:32,412 --> 00:16:34,678
Why does everything smell
so great?

286
00:16:34,714 --> 00:16:37,915
Because your doppelganger
hasn't met cocaine yet.

287
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:42,319
Todd! Todd! Todd!
Todd! Todd! Todd!

288
00:16:42,355 --> 00:16:45,189
Why is everyone cheering for...

289
00:16:45,224 --> 00:16:48,159
- Todd?
- Oh, hey.

290
00:16:48,194 --> 00:16:50,561
You guys!

291
00:16:50,596 --> 00:16:52,263
You made a lot of friends, huh?

292
00:16:52,298 --> 00:16:53,931
I heard you guys were dead.

293
00:16:53,966 --> 00:16:57,601
So I threw this massive rager
in your honor.

294
00:16:57,637 --> 00:17:00,171
The fact that you just
called it a rager sickens me.

295
00:17:00,206 --> 00:17:03,474
Thing is, it went great,

296
00:17:03,509 --> 00:17:07,244
and everyone had so much fun
that I kind of...

297
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,979
Became the new me.

298
00:17:12,051 --> 00:17:14,685
Todd, answer truthfully.

299
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,420
Are you wearing my vest?

300
00:17:16,456 --> 00:17:21,091
I am wearing your vest.

301
00:17:21,127 --> 00:17:22,660
Keep it.

302
00:17:22,695 --> 00:17:25,563
New plan--
I give up on Fillory

303
00:17:25,598 --> 00:17:28,232
and dedicate myself completely
to destroying Todd.

304
00:17:28,267 --> 00:17:31,135
- Oh, it's just Todd.
- "Just Todd"?

305
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:33,704
He's usurping me.
My entire kingdom is at stake.

306
00:17:33,739 --> 00:17:36,574
Your actual kingdom
is actually at stake.

307
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:38,209
There are some things
more important

308
00:17:38,244 --> 00:17:39,410
than saving an entire world.

309
00:17:39,445 --> 00:17:41,011
Okay, I'm gonna go out on a limb

310
00:17:41,047 --> 00:17:44,048
and say this isn't really
about Todd.

311
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:48,586
You don't say, Margo.

312
00:17:48,621 --> 00:17:51,255
No killing Todd.

313
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:54,692
Fucking Todd.

314
00:18:29,695 --> 00:18:31,662
Is this a bad time?

315
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,567
Come sit over here.

316
00:18:39,405 --> 00:18:42,773
I saw a-a... strange woman.

317
00:18:42,808 --> 00:18:46,277
She's... pale and had...

318
00:18:46,312 --> 00:18:48,112
horn things.

319
00:18:48,147 --> 00:18:50,581
You've seen the White Lady.

320
00:18:50,616 --> 00:18:52,583
I'm sorry.
"White Lady?"

321
00:18:52,618 --> 00:18:54,818
You are fortunate
she offered herself

322
00:18:54,854 --> 00:18:56,387
to some Centaur's sight

323
00:18:56,422 --> 00:18:58,656
while you happened
to be watching.

324
00:19:04,263 --> 00:19:07,390
- Is that--
- Mm, skin.

325
00:19:07,676 --> 00:19:11,101
It won't feel,
but it might help you forget

326
00:19:11,137 --> 00:19:12,570
what's underneath.

327
00:19:30,894 --> 00:19:32,556
Get up, Coldwater!

328
00:19:32,592 --> 00:19:33,592
What--what happened?

329
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:35,851
My hands tried to kill me,
so I broke my own arms.

330
00:19:36,429 --> 00:19:38,093
Look, forget all the mean shit
I said to you earlier.

331
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,916
The Bronies can't fix me.
I need your help.

332
00:19:41,088 --> 00:19:42,354
Okay, I guess.

333
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:45,924
First things first--
find an ax.

334
00:19:48,876 --> 00:19:50,744
Are you sure about this?

335
00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:52,913
Do you know how strong
booze has to be

336
00:19:52,948 --> 00:19:55,615
to get a horse drunk?

337
00:19:57,486 --> 00:19:59,653
I c--I ca--
I can't feel my face,

338
00:19:59,688 --> 00:20:01,989
much less my face...

339
00:20:02,024 --> 00:20:05,892
I mean hands.

340
00:20:05,928 --> 00:20:07,127
Just do it.

341
00:20:07,162 --> 00:20:10,497
I'm going to.
Jeez.

342
00:20:13,936 --> 00:20:14,901
Nope.

343
00:20:14,937 --> 00:20:17,004
Damn it, Quentin!

344
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,905
Sorry, I just--I panicked.
I don't love blood.

345
00:20:18,941 --> 00:20:20,540
Who loves blood?

346
00:20:20,576 --> 00:20:22,943
I'm not gonna feel anything,
so fucking go!

347
00:20:22,978 --> 00:20:24,644
- I don't think I can do this.
- Oh, my God!

348
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,079
I knew I fucking couldn't
count on you!

349
00:20:26,115 --> 00:20:29,616
You are so fucking pathetic,
you--you--you floppy-haired,

350
00:20:29,651 --> 00:20:31,551
limp dicked dork.

351
00:20:31,587 --> 00:20:33,954
Fucking--no wonder Alice
couldn't get off on you.

352
00:20:33,989 --> 00:20:35,756
- You have no fu--Aah!
- Aah!

353
00:20:35,791 --> 00:20:37,491
- Oh, I fucking feel it!
- Okay, okay!

354
00:20:37,526 --> 00:20:39,693
- Oh, what did you do?
- I can fix it! I can fix it!

355
00:20:51,106 --> 00:20:52,773
Oh, I wouldn't.

356
00:20:52,808 --> 00:20:54,574
Todd made that.
It's vile.

357
00:21:00,015 --> 00:21:03,150
Here.

358
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,721
Mmm.
Delicious.

359
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:11,024
- I'm Eliot.
- Javier.

360
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,627
You're a first-year?

361
00:21:13,662 --> 00:21:14,895
Second-year.

362
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:17,130
<i>Universidad De Asombro</i> in Spain.

363
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,999
I'm here
for the Welters tournament.

364
00:21:19,034 --> 00:21:20,434
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

365
00:21:20,469 --> 00:21:22,169
I would make a joke
about ball handling,

366
00:21:22,204 --> 00:21:25,472
but I'm deadly serious
about ball handling.

367
00:21:25,507 --> 00:21:27,874
- Me too.
- Mm.

368
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,810
Listen, Javier, I could
keep this up all night...

369
00:21:29,845 --> 00:21:32,212
- So could I.
- But I have to reclaim my title

370
00:21:32,247 --> 00:21:33,680
as the life of this
and every party

371
00:21:33,715 --> 00:21:35,048
by making a drink
so perfect--

372
00:21:35,084 --> 00:21:39,219
It seems like you need to relax.

373
00:21:39,254 --> 00:21:41,188
I'm married...

374
00:21:41,223 --> 00:21:42,522
to a woman.

375
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:44,057
I have a boyfriend.

376
00:21:44,093 --> 00:21:46,693
but he's on another
continent, so...

377
00:21:46,728 --> 00:21:49,062
it doesn't count.

378
00:21:49,098 --> 00:21:51,765
And where is your wife?

379
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,100
On another planet.

380
00:21:53,135 --> 00:21:56,203
Definitely doesn't count.

381
00:22:07,516 --> 00:22:09,983
Ahh.
It's working.

382
00:22:10,018 --> 00:22:11,218
<i>¿Qué?</i>

383
00:22:11,253 --> 00:22:12,719
Nothing.
Back at it.

384
00:22:17,726 --> 00:22:19,259
Eliot?

385
00:22:19,294 --> 00:22:22,662
Hey. You were talking
in your sleep.

386
00:22:22,698 --> 00:22:24,531
What--what did you do?

387
00:22:24,566 --> 00:22:28,168
I'm sorry. I get a little bit
enthusiastic sometimes.

388
00:22:28,203 --> 00:22:29,269
I'll be gentle.

389
00:22:29,304 --> 00:22:30,904
You've been in bed all day.

390
00:22:30,939 --> 00:22:32,772
I came to check on you.

391
00:22:32,808 --> 00:22:35,775
I'm fine.
I'm f-f-fine.

392
00:22:35,811 --> 00:22:38,512
Uh, are you sure
you still want--

393
00:22:38,547 --> 00:22:39,846
Uh, I-I do.

394
00:22:39,882 --> 00:22:41,081
- What?
- I do...

395
00:22:41,116 --> 00:22:43,617
want to tell you I'm sorry.

396
00:22:43,652 --> 00:22:45,986
- I'm so sorry.
- For what?

397
00:22:46,021 --> 00:22:47,154
Um...

398
00:22:47,189 --> 00:22:49,289
I'm gonna go.

399
00:22:49,324 --> 00:22:51,224
Um...

400
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,560
No, no. No, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

401
00:22:53,595 --> 00:22:55,562
I-I absolutely want
to have sex right now.

402
00:22:55,597 --> 00:22:58,064
You do?

403
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,667
Yeah.

404
00:23:06,074 --> 00:23:08,074
Ah...

405
00:23:10,612 --> 00:23:11,778
This is interesting.

406
00:23:11,813 --> 00:23:13,680
Do you want me to stop?

407
00:23:13,715 --> 00:23:16,316
Uh...

408
00:23:39,775 --> 00:23:42,876
- Good morning, Quentin.
- How's Penny?

409
00:23:42,911 --> 00:23:46,246
He lost a lot of blood,
but he'll live.

410
00:23:46,281 --> 00:23:48,181
You're ready
for physical therapy.

411
00:23:48,217 --> 00:23:50,984
Some calisthenics maybe
or core work?

412
00:23:51,019 --> 00:23:53,220
I had something else
in mind, actually.

413
00:24:27,956 --> 00:24:30,924
You're exactly as good with
a bow as you are with an ax.

414
00:24:30,959 --> 00:24:33,994
Since I was a kid, The Beast has
been whispering shit in my ear.

415
00:24:34,029 --> 00:24:36,663
Now that he's dead, the world's
gotten a lot quieter...

416
00:24:36,698 --> 00:24:38,965
or would be
if not for you out here

417
00:24:39,001 --> 00:24:42,669
thinking low-self-esteem shit.

418
00:24:42,704 --> 00:24:45,639
I'll re-do my wards.

419
00:24:45,674 --> 00:24:47,741
There's something
in the Declan text

420
00:24:47,776 --> 00:24:49,876
about making arrows
fly straight.

421
00:24:49,911 --> 00:24:51,077
Show me.

422
00:24:51,113 --> 00:24:52,679
If I had middle fingers,

423
00:24:52,714 --> 00:24:54,147
you know what they'd be doing
right now?

424
00:24:54,182 --> 00:24:56,049
Start with Popper 31.

425
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:04,891
Now cross your index
and ring fingers.

426
00:25:04,926 --> 00:25:08,128
No, under the middle.

427
00:25:08,163 --> 00:25:11,031
Now slide the thumb
along the meridian.

428
00:25:11,066 --> 00:25:12,799
Now draw the arrow back.

429
00:25:20,108 --> 00:25:22,175
- Thank you.
- Thank me by shutting up.

430
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:25,045
There's a creature
called the White Lady.

431
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,713
I saw her yesterday.

432
00:25:26,748 --> 00:25:29,115
She's one of the seven
Questing Creatures of Fillory.

433
00:25:29,151 --> 00:25:32,352
If you can catch her, she has
to give you whatever you ask.

434
00:25:32,387 --> 00:25:34,427
Plover wrote about her,
called her the Winter's Doe.

435
00:25:34,456 --> 00:25:36,723
She lives in the Darkling Wood.

436
00:25:36,758 --> 00:25:38,024
It's just past
the Flying Forest.

437
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:41,094
It's not far from here.

438
00:25:41,129 --> 00:25:42,762
We could hunt her together.

439
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:45,398
"Let's go hunt the White Lady"?

440
00:25:45,434 --> 00:25:47,967
People like me get shot
for saying shit like that.

441
00:25:48,003 --> 00:25:50,337
She can give you
your hands back.

442
00:25:50,372 --> 00:25:52,439
What's in it for you?

443
00:25:52,474 --> 00:25:55,008
I'm gonna ask her
to bring Alice back to life.

444
00:25:58,046 --> 00:26:00,146
<i>♪ ♪</i>

445
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:07,819
The river we crossed
was at the edge of it.

446
00:26:07,854 --> 00:26:11,289
So we're in the Flying Forest.

447
00:26:11,324 --> 00:26:14,625
What? Shouldn't the trees be,
like, flying and shit?

448
00:26:14,661 --> 00:26:18,062
Yeah, actually.
Most of them are crepuscular.

449
00:26:18,097 --> 00:26:21,299
It means they're active
at dawn and dusk.

450
00:26:21,334 --> 00:26:23,334
You smell that?

451
00:26:23,369 --> 00:26:24,802
It smells like...

452
00:26:24,838 --> 00:26:27,338
Good.

453
00:26:27,373 --> 00:26:29,273
What is that?

454
00:26:29,309 --> 00:26:31,309
I don't know.

455
00:26:31,344 --> 00:26:35,213
I th--I think I'm--
I'm getting a contact high.

456
00:26:35,248 --> 00:26:38,115
Yeah. Definitely starting
to feel something.

457
00:26:38,151 --> 00:26:41,953
Flying Forest.

458
00:26:44,023 --> 00:26:45,623
Oh, my God.

459
00:26:45,658 --> 00:26:47,692
The Chatwins were, like, ten
when they came through here.

460
00:26:47,727 --> 00:26:49,427
They must have been blazed
the entire time.

461
00:26:49,462 --> 00:26:51,929
Super inappropriate.

462
00:26:51,965 --> 00:26:53,698
Hey, I-I take back
what I said.

463
00:26:53,733 --> 00:26:55,800
I-I fully expect
to see

464
00:26:55,835 --> 00:26:58,002
a tree flapping around
at any second.

465
00:26:58,037 --> 00:27:00,271
Listen, Quincy,
if we get a tree or--

466
00:27:00,306 --> 00:27:02,940
Did you just call me Quincy?

467
00:27:05,178 --> 00:27:08,346
Is--is that not
your name?

468
00:27:12,218 --> 00:27:14,085
Dude...

469
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,987
dude, what the fuck?

470
00:27:16,022 --> 00:27:17,955
- Get away from my mouth, man.
- It's my mouth.

471
00:27:17,991 --> 00:27:19,690
- Uh...
- No, it's not.

472
00:27:19,726 --> 00:27:21,259
Oh.

473
00:27:21,294 --> 00:27:23,761
Oh, where--
uh, where--

474
00:27:23,796 --> 00:27:25,062
where are my stuff touchers?

475
00:27:25,098 --> 00:27:26,364
Aah! Ooh!

476
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,066
What the fuck is going on?

477
00:27:29,102 --> 00:27:32,403
Who the fuck are you?

478
00:27:32,438 --> 00:27:35,239
Who am I?

479
00:27:35,275 --> 00:27:37,341
I have no idea.

480
00:27:37,377 --> 00:27:40,244
Okay.

481
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:44,415
The Beast shit
in the Wellspring.

482
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:46,817
No. No.
Ember.

483
00:27:46,853 --> 00:27:49,453
Ember shat in the Wellspring.

484
00:27:49,489 --> 00:27:51,789
I think he meant well.

485
00:27:51,824 --> 00:27:53,724
He probably didn't know

486
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,127
how hard it would be
to clean out.

487
00:27:56,162 --> 00:28:00,765
And now magic is failing
on Earth...

488
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,133
because of shit,

489
00:28:02,168 --> 00:28:04,368
proving once again
that comedy and tragedy

490
00:28:04,404 --> 00:28:07,104
can coexist
in the same goddamn sentence.

491
00:28:09,175 --> 00:28:12,410
Honestly...

492
00:28:12,445 --> 00:28:14,178
I am in over my head.

493
00:28:14,213 --> 00:28:16,981
I am not even in control
of which world

494
00:28:17,016 --> 00:28:19,317
my body is awake in,
and my sexually aggressive wife,

495
00:28:19,352 --> 00:28:21,218
she could wake me up
at any moment in Fillory.

496
00:28:21,254 --> 00:28:23,454
Eliot, there are certain
student/teacher boundaries

497
00:28:23,489 --> 00:28:25,523
which I'd prefer not to cross.

498
00:28:25,558 --> 00:28:27,358
So what am I supposed
to do, Henry?

499
00:28:27,393 --> 00:28:29,060
What did you think
was going to happen

500
00:28:29,095 --> 00:28:31,963
when you dove headfirst
into another world?

501
00:28:39,005 --> 00:28:40,204
I thought I'd die.

502
00:28:40,239 --> 00:28:42,239
But you didn't.

503
00:28:42,275 --> 00:28:45,009
Now you have two lives.

504
00:28:45,044 --> 00:28:46,310
You're trying to live both.

505
00:28:46,346 --> 00:28:48,479
- Yes.
- Yes, but you can't.

506
00:28:48,514 --> 00:28:50,281
That's stupid.

507
00:28:50,316 --> 00:28:52,049
You can let it tear you in half

508
00:28:52,085 --> 00:28:54,452
or pick one.

509
00:28:54,487 --> 00:28:56,253
I can never leave Fillory.

510
00:28:56,289 --> 00:28:58,255
The choice is easy.

511
00:29:00,393 --> 00:29:02,360
I am...

512
00:29:02,395 --> 00:29:04,495
ill-equipped to be a king.

513
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:06,964
I am no better equipped
to teach one.

514
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,068
Being an adult is recognizing
your responsibilities.

515
00:29:11,104 --> 00:29:14,939
A bunch of my students went
and conquered another world.

516
00:29:14,974 --> 00:29:16,874
They more, like, gave it to us.

517
00:29:16,909 --> 00:29:19,176
Either way,
it doesn't look great for me.

518
00:29:19,212 --> 00:29:22,113
It reeks of Earth privilege.

519
00:29:22,148 --> 00:29:24,415
The very least I can do is...

520
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:25,916
is to help you rule it.

521
00:29:28,554 --> 00:29:30,287
What do you have in mind?

522
00:29:30,323 --> 00:29:32,857
Bring in
the best minds we can--

523
00:29:32,892 --> 00:29:35,092
historians, politicians,

524
00:29:35,128 --> 00:29:38,929
shamans, military leaders.

525
00:29:38,965 --> 00:29:43,467
Hmm.
Your thesis project is...

526
00:29:43,503 --> 00:29:47,038
"How to Save
an Entire Goddamn World."

527
00:29:56,516 --> 00:30:00,084
Right or left?

528
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:03,454
Right seems to be
the popular direction.

529
00:30:08,528 --> 00:30:09,994
I must be an adventurer.

530
00:30:10,029 --> 00:30:12,196
No, you're not.

531
00:30:12,231 --> 00:30:14,165
What?
I have a bow and arrow

532
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,102
and a cool questing outfit
and a manservant.

533
00:30:18,137 --> 00:30:21,305
Oh-ho-ho, you did not
just say that, white boy.

534
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:25,476
Besides, what kind of servant
has no fucking hands?

535
00:30:29,549 --> 00:30:32,616
Right or left?

536
00:30:32,652 --> 00:30:35,019
Right seems to be
the popular direction.

537
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:43,294
Julia?

538
00:30:45,098 --> 00:30:46,897
What the hell
are you doing here?

539
00:30:46,933 --> 00:30:48,532
- Look, I can explain.
- No.

540
00:30:48,568 --> 00:30:50,534
After you jumped in and screwed
everything up with Penny,

541
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:53,504
Alice died killing
your little friend Martin.

542
00:30:53,539 --> 00:30:56,307
Then Quentin was almost
ripped in half.

543
00:30:56,342 --> 00:30:58,976
And you have the balls
to come here.

544
00:30:59,011 --> 00:31:00,177
Look, if you guys
had trusted me,

545
00:31:00,213 --> 00:31:01,912
both Reynard and The Beast
would be dead.

546
00:31:01,948 --> 00:31:03,514
None of that
would have happened.

547
00:31:03,549 --> 00:31:05,416
Quentin should have left you
in your little hedge hole,

548
00:31:05,451 --> 00:31:07,918
trading rim jobs for spells.

549
00:31:07,954 --> 00:31:10,488
You actually think because
you go to this bullshit school

550
00:31:10,523 --> 00:31:12,123
that you're better than me.

551
00:31:12,158 --> 00:31:14,992
I think I didn't get
my friends killed.

552
00:31:15,027 --> 00:31:17,027
You don't have friends.

553
00:31:17,063 --> 00:31:19,230
You have people
that are so afraid of you,

554
00:31:19,265 --> 00:31:21,665
they'd rather be on your side.

555
00:31:21,701 --> 00:31:25,636
There's a difference.

556
00:31:25,671 --> 00:31:28,272
Well...

557
00:31:28,307 --> 00:31:31,108
and you have no one.

558
00:31:31,144 --> 00:31:33,010
And you deserve no one.

559
00:31:33,045 --> 00:31:34,445
Look, I don't expect you to care

560
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,247
'cause this doesn't directly
affect your hair

561
00:31:36,282 --> 00:31:39,216
or your social life,
but since you let Reynard free,

562
00:31:39,252 --> 00:31:41,152
he has murdered
over a dozen women,

563
00:31:41,187 --> 00:31:43,454
and this book might be
my last shot at killing him.

564
00:31:56,335 --> 00:31:58,335
The book's blank.

565
00:31:58,371 --> 00:32:01,238
Put yours in the box
and wait for them to mate.

566
00:32:01,274 --> 00:32:04,708
The baby should be a pretty
decent Xerox of the original.

567
00:32:23,037 --> 00:32:25,805
You know what this is?

568
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,840
Ooh, this is a girl's.

569
00:32:30,812 --> 00:32:34,180
What if I'm supposed to be
rescuing her?

570
00:32:34,215 --> 00:32:37,250
Ooh, or what if
you're a stalker?

571
00:32:37,285 --> 00:32:39,252
Right or left?

572
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:45,258
Right seems to be
the popular direction.

573
00:32:45,293 --> 00:32:47,794
Wait, no.

574
00:32:47,829 --> 00:32:50,296
If I'm supposed
to find her, I...

575
00:32:50,331 --> 00:32:53,266
I have to look
where no one else is searching.

576
00:32:53,301 --> 00:32:55,301
What?

577
00:33:08,283 --> 00:33:11,017
Penny.

578
00:33:11,052 --> 00:33:13,920
Douche bag.

579
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:19,559
The effect of the weed forest
is wearing off.

580
00:33:22,897 --> 00:33:24,564
Oh, my God.

581
00:33:28,002 --> 00:33:30,970
It's Alice. Uh...

582
00:33:32,073 --> 00:33:34,807
Quentin, look, I...

583
00:33:34,843 --> 00:33:38,411
I know how you feel, man.

584
00:33:38,446 --> 00:33:42,582
Before, when your wards
were slipping, I...

585
00:33:42,617 --> 00:33:44,984
I know.

586
00:33:47,255 --> 00:33:50,356
- I can't.
- No, hey, no, no. Listen.

587
00:33:50,391 --> 00:33:52,959
You--you can't...

588
00:33:52,994 --> 00:33:55,895
you can't puss out right now.

589
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:58,264
Think about Alice.
She needs you, man.

590
00:34:00,401 --> 00:34:02,568
I need you.

591
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,913
Hey.

592
00:34:13,948 --> 00:34:15,381
Hey.

593
00:34:15,416 --> 00:34:17,583
So I've been thinking.

594
00:34:17,619 --> 00:34:21,520
Is 100 feet really tall enough
for Alice's memorial?

595
00:34:21,556 --> 00:34:24,523
We weren't her friends,
remember?

596
00:34:31,032 --> 00:34:34,567
We owe it to her...

597
00:34:34,602 --> 00:34:37,236
because we weren't her friends.

598
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:44,043
We don't have the money.

599
00:34:44,078 --> 00:34:46,979
We're magicians.

600
00:34:47,015 --> 00:34:49,415
Let's build it ourselves.

601
00:34:51,319 --> 00:34:54,553
Look, what Margo said
about me was true.

602
00:34:54,589 --> 00:34:58,057
So if--if you want to bail,
now's your chance.

603
00:34:58,092 --> 00:35:01,360
Well, you do have
questionable judgment.

604
00:35:01,396 --> 00:35:04,463
I mean,
we're best bitches, right?

605
00:35:04,499 --> 00:35:06,465
For better or for worse.

606
00:35:06,501 --> 00:35:07,667
God.

607
00:35:10,405 --> 00:35:12,138
Wait a minute.

608
00:35:12,173 --> 00:35:14,140
I know why Marina
wanted me to find the book.

609
00:35:14,175 --> 00:35:16,542
- Why?
- It's a necromancy spell.

610
00:35:16,577 --> 00:35:20,313
As in bring back to life?

611
00:35:20,348 --> 00:35:21,981
No, no fucking way.

612
00:35:22,016 --> 00:35:24,450
- Kady--
- She killed my mother.

613
00:35:24,485 --> 00:35:26,419
Look, the effects are unstable.

614
00:35:26,454 --> 00:35:29,622
It'll only last a few minutes,
and then she goes away again.

615
00:35:29,657 --> 00:35:31,190
Fine.

616
00:35:33,461 --> 00:35:35,361
Fine.
Let's defrost the bitch.

617
00:35:39,968 --> 00:35:44,003
It says the last ingredient
is the book itself.

618
00:35:44,038 --> 00:35:46,005
Then we got one chance.

619
00:35:59,454 --> 00:36:02,355
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

620
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:03,956
It's okay.
It's okay.

621
00:36:03,992 --> 00:36:05,658
My skin is so cold.

622
00:36:05,693 --> 00:36:07,526
- It's okay. Look at me, please.
- You--you brought me back--

623
00:36:07,562 --> 00:36:09,202
You had a message
you wanted to tell me.

624
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,497
- I'm gonna die.
- We don't have that much time.

625
00:36:11,532 --> 00:36:13,499
You don't understand.
You don't know where I was.

626
00:36:13,534 --> 00:36:15,634
I don't want to go back there.
I don't want to go back there.

627
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,403
Marina, your clock
is running out, okay?

628
00:36:17,438 --> 00:36:19,438
Please, you are the strongest
person that I have ever met.

629
00:36:19,474 --> 00:36:21,173
I need you to pull it
together now,

630
00:36:21,209 --> 00:36:22,641
and I need you to tell me.

631
00:36:22,677 --> 00:36:26,278
I need you to tell me
about the thing that killed you.

632
00:36:29,283 --> 00:36:31,017
You can stop him, Julia.

633
00:36:31,052 --> 00:36:34,220
It is possible,
but you need to do it.

634
00:36:34,255 --> 00:36:36,722
- You need to do it.
- Okay, what?

635
00:36:36,758 --> 00:36:38,324
What do I need to do?

636
00:36:38,359 --> 00:36:41,360
There was... a girl.

637
00:36:41,396 --> 00:36:45,531
40 years ago,
she banished Reynard from Earth.

638
00:36:45,566 --> 00:36:47,666
That's where he was
until you summoned him.

639
00:36:47,702 --> 00:36:50,569
That's where he was
until you brought him back.

640
00:36:50,605 --> 00:36:53,406
I'm sorr--I'm sorry.

641
00:37:13,661 --> 00:37:15,628
Shh.

642
00:37:52,935 --> 00:37:55,036
Hi.

643
00:37:55,071 --> 00:37:57,672
Don't run.

644
00:37:57,707 --> 00:37:59,674
Are you gonna?

645
00:38:02,312 --> 00:38:03,778
What's the deal?

646
00:38:03,813 --> 00:38:07,748
I don't know.
She's kind of ignoring me.

647
00:38:07,784 --> 00:38:10,318
Yo, White Lady, we caught you.

648
00:38:10,353 --> 00:38:14,288
Hey, show some respect.

649
00:38:14,324 --> 00:38:18,025
Pardon me...
Miss Lady?

650
00:38:18,061 --> 00:38:19,861
It hurts.

651
00:38:19,896 --> 00:38:22,697
Uh, sorry.
Uh...

652
00:38:22,732 --> 00:38:24,065
Why have you come?

653
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,466
That's my arrow.

654
00:38:25,502 --> 00:38:26,968
You have to give me what I ask.

655
00:38:27,003 --> 00:38:30,404
Obviously, you turd.

656
00:38:36,813 --> 00:38:38,880
Look at you.

657
00:38:38,915 --> 00:38:42,850
Someone's been rebuilt...

658
00:38:42,886 --> 00:38:44,886
and so cleverly.

659
00:38:51,027 --> 00:38:53,027
Mm.

660
00:38:54,531 --> 00:38:56,497
Feel that?

661
00:38:58,067 --> 00:39:00,001
Could you not?

662
00:39:00,036 --> 00:39:02,069
Here's a riddle.

663
00:39:02,105 --> 00:39:03,638
How much do you have to lose

664
00:39:03,673 --> 00:39:06,073
before you're no longer
yourself?

665
00:39:06,109 --> 00:39:08,042
I don't know.
Why don't you tell me?

666
00:39:08,077 --> 00:39:10,077
What is it, Quentin Coldwater,

667
00:39:10,113 --> 00:39:11,879
that you ache for?

668
00:39:11,915 --> 00:39:13,814
You have a crown

669
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:17,518
and the power to reshape
the very ether to your whim.

670
00:39:17,554 --> 00:39:20,988
What else could you
possibly want?

671
00:39:21,024 --> 00:39:24,892
Um, technically speaking,
uh, we both caught you, so...

672
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,928
Shut up. I'll ask for your
thing with my third wish.

673
00:39:26,963 --> 00:39:29,730
No.
We each get a wish,

674
00:39:29,766 --> 00:39:32,500
and then we have one
mutually agreeable third wish.

675
00:39:32,535 --> 00:39:34,535
You can each have one wish,
or you can fuck off.

676
00:39:34,571 --> 00:39:35,836
Okay.

677
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:41,142
Alice Quinn...

678
00:39:42,645 --> 00:39:44,445
Bring her back to life...

679
00:39:46,482 --> 00:39:49,650
Please.

680
00:39:49,686 --> 00:39:52,019
I can't.

681
00:39:52,055 --> 00:39:54,388
What do you mean you can't?

682
00:39:54,424 --> 00:39:57,558
You are not the only magical
creature in this fucking forest.

683
00:39:57,594 --> 00:39:58,960
True.

684
00:39:58,995 --> 00:40:01,062
And we all have limits.

685
00:40:01,097 --> 00:40:03,364
We can give you anything.

686
00:40:03,399 --> 00:40:05,733
But we cannot pierce that veil.

687
00:40:05,768 --> 00:40:07,768
Alice is gone.

688
00:40:16,412 --> 00:40:19,814
My turn.

689
00:40:19,849 --> 00:40:21,616
I want my hands back.

690
00:40:21,651 --> 00:40:22,984
That I can do.

691
00:40:29,692 --> 00:40:33,661
No!

692
00:40:35,565 --> 00:40:36,797
What did you do to him?

693
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:38,933
That screaming was irritating.

694
00:40:38,968 --> 00:40:41,035
He'll wake when he's healed.

695
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:44,071
Now, I can't nap
until I've granted your wish.

696
00:40:44,107 --> 00:40:46,507
I'd like to be happy.
Could you do that?

697
00:40:46,542 --> 00:40:48,976
I can do wonders.

698
00:40:49,012 --> 00:40:51,078
But you should know...

699
00:40:51,114 --> 00:40:55,683
there's nothing I can give you
that will soothe your Shade.

700
00:40:55,718 --> 00:40:58,686
There's only
what I can take away.

701
00:40:58,721 --> 00:41:01,055
You'd take away
my memories of Alice?

702
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:03,958
Yes.
I would free you completely.

703
00:41:06,929 --> 00:41:09,497
No.

704
00:41:09,532 --> 00:41:13,034
You are wiser than you appear.

705
00:41:13,069 --> 00:41:16,237
You would find your way
back to sadness,

706
00:41:16,272 --> 00:41:18,706
no matter how far
you run from it.

707
00:41:18,741 --> 00:41:21,108
Well, that's comforting.

708
00:41:21,144 --> 00:41:24,945
Is there nothing else
you desire?

709
00:41:24,981 --> 00:41:28,849
Everything I've ever wanted,
I've got.

710
00:41:28,885 --> 00:41:32,753
Magic is real, and it can fix
anything except what I need.

711
00:41:34,524 --> 00:41:36,924
I loved a girl.

712
00:41:39,629 --> 00:41:42,863
My entire life...
I've dreamed of Fillory,

713
00:41:42,899 --> 00:41:46,133
that I would be like
Martin Chatwin.

714
00:41:46,169 --> 00:41:48,569
I'd find a way
to stay here forever.

715
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,147
Send me home.

716
00:42:18,538 --> 00:42:28,538
