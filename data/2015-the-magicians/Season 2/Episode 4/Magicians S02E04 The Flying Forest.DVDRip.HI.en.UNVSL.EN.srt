00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:42,107
If I got the cavalry and I
came back to help you. But I...

181
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:44,444
I just ran.

182
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,046
I hid. (CHUCKLES)

183
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,024
Yeah, well, there was
nothing you could've done then.

184
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,358
But you can help me now.

185
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,062
(GASPS) Oh, my God.

186
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,296
(STAMMERING)
Julia, is that... Marina.

187
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:05,127
She helped me bait a trap
for Reynard. He killed her.

188
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:06,696
You freeze-dried her corpse?

189
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,264
Alonso's Reverse Thermogenesis.

190
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,365
But look.

191
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:12,839
She left this for a reason.

192
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,172
A message, or a code. I
mean, at least, I thought that.

193
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:17,808
No, no, I know
exactly what that is.

194
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,746
That's a locator number.

195
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:22,648
For a book in the
library at Brakebills.

196
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:39,872
Be careful.

197
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,966
(CHUCKLES) That's a
long drop for human legs.

198
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:46,604
We would not want to see you
get hurt so soon after being rebuilt.

199
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,377
Rebuilt?

200
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:57,557
It's strange, I know.
But you'll get used to it.

201
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:01,117
Is this a hospital?
Are you a doctor?

202
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:02,423
You're at the Retreat.

203
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,828
A few hours' gallop
north of Whitespire.

204
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:07,027
I was a patient, years ago.

205
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,928
The centaurs saved my
life when no one else could.

206
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:13,235
Now I try to repay that debt
by serving them as a nurse.

207
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,735
The centaurs? Mmm.

208
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:17,001
Horse people.

209
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,076
Mmm-hmm.

210
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:20,045
How long have I... Three weeks.

211
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:22,181
Your injuries were severe.

212
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:26,413
Your friends were called
away, but they left that for you.

213
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,380
We can start physical
therapy in the morning.

214
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:53,374

Alice today in the gardens,</i>

(SNIFFLES)

222
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,169
Margo sent me here to
get my hands checked out.

223
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:27,373
Look...

224
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:31,373
It sucks about Alice.

225
00:12:32,118 --> 00:12:33,211
"Sucks"?

226
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:35,311
That's the best that you can do?

227
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:36,583
I cared about her, too.

228
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:38,852
For what, like, 10
minutes, including foreplay?

229
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,703
Are you mad at me because
I cared too much or too little?

230
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:42,559
I'm mad 'cause you
fucked up the one thing

231
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,709
that we were counting on
you for. You wanna blame me?

232
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,893
It was your cacodemon
that killed her.

233
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,931
That was not Alice.
Alice was gone.

234
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:50,766
So you just saved the day, huh?

235
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,834
Can we just...

236
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:57,944
Convalesce from our horrible
injuries separately, please?

237
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:03,609
Nice to see you, too, man.

238
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:14,387
Good day. My name is

(SNIFFS) Ugh!

240
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,811
Those are the most accursed
things I've ever smelled.

241
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:22,529
They must be removed, posthaste.

242
00:13:23,436 --> 00:13:24,436
(STRAINING)

243
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,830
How did they
become cursed? Uh...

Some guy, this valet-type-of-dude

The River Watcher.

You know him?

247
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:34,881
I'm sorry, I... I
can't help you.

248

00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,093
or give me some magic
wooden shit, like you did Quentin.

I'm a surgeon. I can't risk the
curse spreading to my own hands.

The River Watcher... (EXHALES)
He's mercurial, and dangerous.

252
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:48,953
You erred greatly in
offending him, Penny.

banging yourself, aren't you?

Shh. Shh. Shh.

263
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:18,023
No, no, doing your clone is
more like AP-level masturbation.

264
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:20,022
Ugh. Put on a robe, would you?

265
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:28,825
Aw. Now, part two.

You sleep here, your
mind goes into the golem.

269
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:38,035
And the golem
goes to Brakebills.

Unless, of course, we're wrong
about the fine print in my contract

Fillory either...

the button and just explodes.

off the second I pop in.

(SIGHS) Damn it.

00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,562
It's like a library LoJack.

called it a rager sickens me.

is, it went great,

Your actual kingdom
is actually at stake.

There are some things more
important than saving an entire world.

really about Todd.

herself to some centaur's sight

to be watching.

(EXHALES)

355
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:18,917
Nope.

356
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:20,844
Damn it, Quentin!

357
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,698
Sorry. I just... I panicked.
I don't love blood.

358
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:26,784
Who loves blood? I'm not
gonna feel anything, so fucking go!

359
00:20:26,859 --> 00:20:28,336
I don't think I can
do this. Oh, my God!

360
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,880
I knew I fucking
couldn't count on you.

361
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:31,295
You are so fucking pathetic,

362
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:36,096
you floppy-haired,
limp-dicked dork, fucking...

363
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:37,728
No wonder Alice
couldn't get off on you,

364
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,238
you have no fuck... (SCREAMING)

365
00:20:39,305 --> 00:20:40,830
(SCREAMING)
Oh, I fucking feel it!

366
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,050
Okay. Okay. Oh, what did you do?

367
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,337
I can fix it! I can fix it!

368
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:45,975
(BOTH SCREAMING)

369
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:56,589
Oh, I wouldn't.

370
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,288
Todd made that. It's vile.

371
00:21:04,296 --> 00:21:06,197
Here. (CHUCKLES)

372
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,268
Mmm.

373
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:11,703
Delicious. (CHUCKLES)

374
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,804
I'm Eliot. Javier.

375
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,202
You're a first-year?

376
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:18,436
Second-year.

377
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:20,742
Universidad de Asombro in Spain.

378
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,776
I'm here for the
Welters tournament.

379
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:23,915
Oh. Mmm-hmm.

380
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,314
I would make a joke
about ball-handling,

381
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:29,219
but I'm deadly serious
about ball-handling.

382
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,654
Me too. (LAUGHS)

383
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,182
Listen, Javier, I could keep
this up all night. So could I.

384
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,626
But I have to reclaim my title

385
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:37,128
as the life of this
and every party

386
00:21:37,196 --> 00:21:38,789
by making a drink so perfect...

387
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:40,662
It seems like you need to relax.

388
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,430
I'm married.

389
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,299
To a woman. I have a boyfriend.

390
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:51,700
But he's on another
continent, so it doesn't count.

391
00:21:53,012 --> 00:21:54,878
And where is your wife?

392
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,010
On another planet.

393
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:00,051
(SCOFFS) Definitely
doesn't count.

394
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:12,397
(SIGHS)

395
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:13,727
It's working.

396
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:15,099
<i>Qué?</i>

397
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:16,702
Nothing, back at it.

398
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:17,769
(CLEARS THROAT)

399
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:20,430
(MOANS AND LAUGHS)

400
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,440
FEN: <i>Eliot?</i>

401
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:25,307
(GASPS) Hey. You
were talking in your sleep.

402
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:27,980
(EXHALES) What did you do?

403
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:31,950
I'm sorry, (LAUGHS) I get a
little bit enthusiastic sometimes.

404
00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:33,318
I'll be gentle.

405
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:35,445
You've been in bed all
day, I came to check on you.

406
00:22:37,156 --> 00:22:39,421
I'm fine. I'm fine.

407
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,623
You sure you still want... I do.

408
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:44,959
What? I do...

409
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:48,595
Want to tell you I'm
sorry. I'm so sorry.

410
00:22:48,801 --> 00:22:49,801
For what?

411
00:22:49,902 --> 00:22:50,902
Um... (LAUGHS)

412
00:22:52,438 --> 00:22:54,373
I'm gonna go. Um...

413
00:22:55,107 --> 00:22:59,067
No, no, no, no, no, no. I absolutely
wanna have sex right now.

414
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,378
(INHALES)

415
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:01,841
You do?

416
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:04,009
Yeah.

417
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:11,122
Ah.

418
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:15,621
This is interesting.

419
00:23:15,694 --> 00:23:17,026
BOTH: Do you want me to stop?

420
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,731
Uh...

421
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,150
(PANTING)

422
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:44,923
NURSE: Good morning, Quentin.

423
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:46,291
How is Penny?

424
00:23:46,692 --> 00:23:49,252
He lost a lot of
blood, but he'll live.

425
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:52,058
You're ready for
physical therapy.

426
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:54,497
Some calisthenics,
maybe, or core work?

427
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:57,001
I had something
else in mind, actually.

428
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:34,068
PENNY: You're exactly as good
with a bow as you are with an ax.

429
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:37,707
Since I was a kid, The Beast
has been whispering shit in my ear.

430
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,072
Now that he's dead, the
world's gotten a lot quieter.

431
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:42,678
Or would be, if
not for you out here

432
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:44,683
thinking low self-esteem shit.

433
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:48,052
I'll re-do my wards.

434
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,916
There's something in the Declan
text about making arrows fly straight.

435
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:54,993
Show me.

436
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:57,654
If I had middle fingers, you know
what they'd be doing right now?

437
00:24:58,097 --> 00:24:59,656
Start with Popper No. 31.

438
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:07,872
Now cross your
index and ring fingers.

439
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:10,436
No, under the middle.

440
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:14,240
Now slide the thumb
along the meridian.

441
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,381
Now draw the arrow back.

442
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,984
Thank you. Thank
me by shutting up.

443
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:28,323
There's a creature
called The White Lady.

444
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:30,185
I saw her yesterday.

445
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:32,857
She's one of the seven
Questing Creatures of Fillory.

446
00:25:33,065 --> 00:25:36,263
If you can catch her, she has
to give you whatever you ask.

447
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,246
Plover wrote about her, he
called her the Winter's Doe.

448
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,829
She lives in the Darkling Wood.

449
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:43,601
It's just past the Flying
Forest, it's not far from here.

450
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:46,443
We could hunt her together.

451
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:48,504
Let's go hunt The White Lady?

452
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:51,746
People like me get shot
for saying shit like that.

453
00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:53,513
She can give you
your hands back.

454
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,752
What's in it for you?

455
00:25:56,455 --> 00:25:59,687
I'm gonna ask her to
bring Alice back to life.

456
00:26:09,701 --> 00:26:11,966
So the river we crossed
was at the edge of it.

457
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:15,299
So, we're in the Flying Forest.

458
00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:19,335
Shouldn't the trees
be, like, flying and shit?

459
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:22,313
Yes, actually. Most of
them are crepuscular.

460
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:25,350
It means they're active
at dawn and dusk.

461
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:27,616
You smell that? (SNIFFS)

462
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,289
It smells like... Good.

463
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:31,689
(SNIFFS)

464
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:33,552
What is that?

465
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:35,488
I don't know.

466
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:39,263
(LAUGHS) I think I'm
getting a contact high.

467
00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:42,499
Yeah. Definitely
starting to feel something.

468
00:26:42,668 --> 00:26:43,668
(LAUGHING)

469
00:26:44,536 --> 00:26:46,801
"Flying Forest"?

470
00:26:46,872 --> 00:26:48,135
(LAUGHING)

471
00:26:48,674 --> 00:26:50,199
Oh, my God,

472
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,420
the Chatwins were, like, 10
when they came through here.

473
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,276
They must've been
blazed the entire time.

474
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:56,405
Super inappropriate.

475
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,262
QUENTIN: Hey, I
take back what I said.

476
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:02,612
I fully expect to see a tree
flapping around at any second.

477
00:27:02,821 --> 00:27:04,790
Listen, Quincy, if
we get a tree or...

478
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,051
Did you just call me Quincy?

479
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:13,128
Is that not your name?

480
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:18,195
Dude.

481
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:20,197
Dude, what the fuck?

482
00:27:20,706 --> 00:27:21,935
Get away from my mouth, man.

483
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:23,134
It's my mouth. Ahh.

484
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,308
No, it's not.

485
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:25,376
Oh!

486
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:29,876
Oh, where, uh, where
are my stuff touchers?

487
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:31,048
Ha! Ooh!

488
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,319
What the fuck is going on?

489
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:34,846
Who the fuck are you?

490
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:38,788
Who am I?

491
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,152
I have no idea. (LAUGHS)

492
00:27:42,294 --> 00:27:44,126
(EXHALES) Okay.

493
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:48,601
The Beast shit
in the Wellspring?

494
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:54,106
No. No. Ember. Ember
shat in the Wellspring.

495
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:56,336
(SIGHS) I think he meant well.

496
00:27:56,408 --> 00:28:00,106
He probably didn't know how
hard it would be to clean out.

497
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:04,772
And now, magic
is failing on Earth

498
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,610
because of shit.

499
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:09,013
Proving once again
that comedy and tragedy

500
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:11,886
can coexist in the same
goddamn sentence.

501
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:18,824
Honestly, I am in over my head.

502
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:22,698
I am not even in control of
which world my body is awake in,

503
00:28:22,768 --> 00:28:24,100
and my sexually-aggressive wife,

504
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:25,969
she could wake me up
at any moment in Fillory.

505
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:28,283
(CLEARS THROAT) Eliot, there
are certain student-teacher boundaries

506
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:30,276
which I'd prefer not to cross.

507
00:28:30,342 --> 00:28:32,072
So what am I
supposed to do, Henry?

508
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:33,806
What did you think
was going to happen

509
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:36,610
when you dove headfirst
into another world?

510
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,324
I thought I'd die.
But you didn't.

511
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:48,627
And now you have two lives.

512
00:28:49,828 --> 00:28:51,694
You're trying to live both. Yes.

513
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:54,790
Yes, but you
can't. That's stupid.

514
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:58,697
You can let it tear
you in half or pick one.

515
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:01,029
I can never leave Fillory.

516
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:02,267
The choice is easy.

517
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:09,241
I am ill-equipped to be a king.

518
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:11,575
I am no better
equipped to teach one.

519
00:29:11,717 --> 00:29:15,313
Being an adult is recognizing
your responsibilities.

520
00:29:15,721 --> 00:29:19,715
A bunch of my students went
and conquered another world.

521
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:21,483
They more like gave it to us.

522
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,961
Either way, it doesn't
look great for me.

523
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:26,828
It reeks of Earth privilege.

524
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:30,562
The very least I can
do is to help you rule it.

525
00:29:33,672 --> 00:29:34,672
What do you have in mind?

526
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,938
Bring in the best minds we can.

527
00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:42,614
Historians, politicians,
shamans, military leaders.

528
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:44,539
(CHUCKLES)

529
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,551
Your thesis project is...

530
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:51,789
"How to Save an
Entire Goddamn World."

531
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:03,497
Right or left?

532
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:08,269
PENNY: Right seems to
be the popular direction.

533
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:14,773
I must be an adventurer.

534
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:16,838
(LAUGHING) No, you're not.

535
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:21,214
What? I have a bow and
arrow and a cool questing outfit.

536
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:22,586
And a manservant.

537
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:26,054
(LAUGHING) Oh, you did
not just say that, white boy.

538
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:30,061
Besides, what kind of
servant has no fucking hands?

539
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:36,200
Right or left?

540
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,763
Right seems to be
the popular direction.

541
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:47,736
MARGO: Julia?

542
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:51,449
What the hell are
you doing here?

543
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:52,609
Look, I can explain. No.

544
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,347
After you jumped in and
screwed everything up with Penny,

545
00:30:55,454 --> 00:30:58,049
Alice died, killing
your little friend Martin.

546
00:30:58,123 --> 00:31:01,093
Then Quentin was
almost ripped in half.

547
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:03,424
And you have the
balls to come here?

548
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:04,927
Look, if you guys
had trusted me,

549
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:06,760
both Reynard and The
Beast would be dead.

550
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:07,942
None of that would've happened.

551
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:10,197
Quentin should've left
you in your little hedge hole,

552
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:12,567
trading rim jobs for spells.

553
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:15,641
You actually think because
you go to this bullshit school,

554
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:16,787
that you're better than me?

555
00:31:16,842 --> 00:31:19,209
I think I didn't get
my friends killed.

556
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:21,177
You don't have friends.

557
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,976
You have people that are so afraid
of you, they'd rather be on your side.

558
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:28,310
There's a difference.

559
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:34,654
Well, and you have no one.

560
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:37,721
And you deserve no one.

561
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:39,173
Look, I don't expect you to care

562
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:42,258
'cause this doesn't directly
affect your hair or your social life,

563
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:43,830
but since you let Reynard free,

564
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,803
he has murdered
over a dozen women

565
00:31:45,871 --> 00:31:48,238
and this book might be
my last shot at killing him.

566
00:32:01,186 --> 00:32:02,484
The book's blank.

567
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:05,918
Put yours in the box
and wait for them to mate.

568
00:32:05,991 --> 00:32:09,052
The baby should be a pretty
decent Xerox of the original.

569
00:32:29,848 --> 00:32:31,339
You know what this is?

570
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:34,409
Oh. It's a girl's.

571
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:39,889
What if I'm supposed
to be rescuing her?

572
00:32:41,193 --> 00:32:43,185
Ooh! Or what if
you're a stalker?

573
00:32:44,362 --> 00:32:45,796
Right or left?

574
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:51,303
Right seems to be
the popular direction.

575
00:32:52,037 --> 00:32:53,335
Wait, no.

576
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:59,068
If I'm supposed to find her, I have to
look where no one else is searching.

577
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:01,371
What?

578
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:08,152

Oh, my God.

00:33:31,977 --> 00:33:33,673
(PANTING) Oh.

586
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,777
(SOBS) It's Alice, uh...

587
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:42,685
Quentin, look. I know
how you feel, man.

588
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:46,903
Before, when your
wards were slipping, I...

589
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:51,057
I know.

590
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:56,791
I can't. No, hey,
no, no. Listen.

591
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:58,562
You can't...

592
00:33:59,905 --> 00:34:01,897
You can't puss out right now.

593
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:05,003
Think about Alice.
She needs you, man.

594
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:09,475
I need you.

595
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:11,578
(SNIFFLES)

596
00:34:19,524 --> 00:34:20,583
Hey.

597
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,059
(SIGHING) Hi.

598
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:23,718
So, I've been thinking,

599
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:28,097
is 100 feet really tall
enough for Alice's memorial?

600
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:31,364
We weren't her
friends, remember?

601
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:39,107
We owe it to her.

602
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,947
Because we weren't her friends.

603
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:49,881
We don't have the money.

604
00:34:50,822 --> 00:34:52,290
We're Magicians.

605
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:56,225
Let's build it ourselves.

606
00:34:58,797 --> 00:35:01,028
Look, what Margo
said about me was true.

607
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:04,128
So, if you wanna bail,
now's your chance.

608
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:07,305
Well, you do have
questionable judgment.

609
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:12,099
I mean, we're "Best Bitches,"
right? (BOTH LAUGH)

For better or for worse. God.

611

Wait a minute.

612
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:20,982
I know why Marina
wanted me to find the book.

613
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:23,453
Why? It's a necromancy spell.

614
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:25,819
As in, bring back to life?

615
00:35:27,192 --> 00:35:29,320
No. No fucking way. Kady...

616
00:35:29,394 --> 00:35:31,090
She killed my mother.

617

Look, the effects are unstable.

618
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:35,124
It'll only last a few minutes,
and then she goes away again.

619
00:35:36,601 --> 00:35:37,728
Fine.

620
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:42,035
Fine, let's defrost the bitch.

00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:49,207
It says the last ingredient
is the book itself.

It's okay. Look at me.
You brought me back.

You had a message
you wanted to tell me...

629
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,073
Now I'm gonna die. We
don't have that much time.

630
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:20,169
You don't understand.
You don't know where I was.

631
00:36:20,245 --> 00:36:22,373
I don't wanna go back
there. I don't wanna go back!

632
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:24,325

running out, okay? Please.

633
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:26,260
You are the strongest
person that I have ever met.

634
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:29,186
I need you to pull it together
now, and I need you to tell me.

635
00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:31,951
I need you to tell me about
the thing that killed you.

You can stop him, Julia.

It is possible, but you need
to do it. You need to do it.

639
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,927
Okay. What? What
do I need to do?

640
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,071
There was a girl.

641
00:36:48,173 --> 00:36:51,940
Forty years ago, she
banished Reynard from Earth.

642
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:54,370
That's where he was
until you summoned him.

643
00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:57,348

until you brought him back.

Don't run.

00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,613
Are you gonna?

651
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:11,148
What's the deal?

652
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:12,849
I don't know, she's
kind of ignoring me.

00:38:28,206 --> 00:38:29,367
Sorry. Uh...

659
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,541
Why have you come?

660
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:34,511
That's my arrow. You
have to give me what I ask.

How much do you have to lose
before you're no longer yourself?

671
00:39:13,551 --> 00:39:15,417
I don't know. Why
don't you tell me?

672
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:18,888
What is it, Quentin
Coldwater, that you ache for?

673
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:20,854
You have a crown

674
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:24,390
and the power to reshape
the very ether to your whim.

675
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:27,728
What else could
you possibly want?

676
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:32,265
Um, technically speaking,
we both caught you, so...

677
00:39:32,337 --> 00:39:34,281
Shut up. I'll ask for your
thing with my third wish.

678
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:37,070
No, we each get a wish,

679

and then we have one
mutually-agreeable third wish.

680
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:41,776
You can each have one
wish or you can fuck off.

681
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:42,905
Okay.

682

00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:51,813
Bring her back to life.

684
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:55,219
Please.

685
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:58,557
I can't.

686
00:39:59,631 --> 00:40:00,929
What do you mean, you can't?

687
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:04,893
You are not the only magical
creature in this fucking forest!

688

689
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:08,363
And we all have limits.

but we cannot pierce that veil.

What did you do to him?

699
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:46,243
That screaming was irritating.

700
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,742
He'll wake when he's healed.

701
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:51,549
Now, I can't nap until
I've granted you a wish.

702
00:40:51,616 --> 00:40:53,881
I'd like to be happy.
Could you do that?

703
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:55,318
I can do wonders.

But you should know,

705
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,716
there is nothing I can give you

706
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,658
that will soothe your Shade.

707
00:41:03,261 --> 00:41:05,287
There is only what
I can take away.

708
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:08,229
You'd take away my
memories of Alice?

709
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,402
Yes. I would free
you completely.

710
00:41:14,739 --> 00:41:15,763
No.

711
00:41:17,008 --> 00:41:18,806
You are wiser than you appear.

712
00:41:20,712 --> 00:41:23,181
You would find your
way back to sadness,

713
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:26,077
no matter how
far you run from it.

714
00:41:26,617 --> 00:41:28,518
Well, that's comforting.

715
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:30,918
Is there nothing
else you desire?

716
00:41:32,457 --> 00:41:34,358
Everything I've
ever wanted, I've got.

717
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,525
Magic is real and it can fix
anything except what I need.

718
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:43,832
I loved a girl.

719
00:41:47,205 --> 00:41:50,232
My entire life, I've
dreamed of Fillory.

720
00:41:50,308 --> 00:41:52,243
That I would be
like Martin Chatwin.

721
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:55,976
I'd find a way to
stay here forever.

722
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:03,653
(SIGHS)

723
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:06,823
Send me home.
