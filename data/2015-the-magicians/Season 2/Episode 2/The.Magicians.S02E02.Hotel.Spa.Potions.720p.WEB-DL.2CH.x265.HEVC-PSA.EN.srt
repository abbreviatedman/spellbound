1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,700
- I hesitated, but the beast,
I should have...

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,170
It's my fault.
- No, it's not.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,500
- It's Julia's fault.

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,240
- You know how to deal
with gods.

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,240
You know how to fuck up
their shit.

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,140
- Julia, no.
- I want to make a deal.

7
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:18,710
- No, guys, she...
She's not sane.

8
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:21,020
- One small consolation is
the bitch is with the beast

9
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,550
right now and I can't really see
that going her way.

10
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,390
- Word as bond.

11
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,090
I assume the extra bits
enchant the blade

12
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,330
to kill me instantly
in the event I break it.

13
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:32,460
- You guys are from brakebills?

14
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,200
Dude, Josh hoberman,
class of '16.

15
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,800
Come with me
if you want to live.

16
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,170
- Yeah, Josh and Victoria
bailed, on one hand.

17
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,140
On the other hand,
you can't really blame them.

18
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,510
- So you were top bitch
in New York for starters.

19
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,450
- Welcome back to brakebills.
- Wait, you went here?

20
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,550
- Kicked out three months
before graduation.

21
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,450
- Let's go steal their shit.
- So there's a bump.

22
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,520
- Bigger than marrying
a total stranger-ette?

23
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,220
- Once you get married,
you won't be able to be

24
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,090
with anyone else, literally.

25
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,590
- But when I go back...

26
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,590
I can never leave fillory.

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,200
- Please fix my hands.

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,600
- See, how do I put this
in a way that you'll understand?

29
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,370
Go fuck yourself.

30
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,510
- According to the best
and only magic we have,

31
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:21,240
the beast will kill us,
end of story.

32
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,380
- Okay, zillion bucks
says the beast comes back

33
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,210
any minute, so what's the plan?

34
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,320
- We lost the blade,
so we need a new something,

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,550
especially while Alice
is still...

36
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,820
- Watch your step...
Wait, this is something.

37
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,190
It's a workbook on spells,
serious ones,

38
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,590
but the actual spells
aren't here.

39
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,530
I know where we need to go.

40
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,630
- Brakebills?

41
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:52,110
♪ ♪

42
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,650
- I don't get it.

43
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,550
How come nobody in a hood
is trying to kill us?

44
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,560
- Okay, that's just weird.

45
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,660
- You want to stop and
figure it out, be my guest.

46
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,280
- You're alive.

47
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,410
What a lovely surprise.

48
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,460
- Okay, so the castle armory
was basically empty,

49
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,930
except for this.

50
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,330
This is a brakebills
student workbook.

51
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:49,930
- I'm not blind, Quentin,
technically.

52
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,930
- From 1893, so I guess that
means that a brakebills student

53
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,300
was in fillory
over a hundred years ago.

54
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,540
- And the only humans that had
access to the armory were...

55
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:02,310
- Own it, pumpkin.
The monarchy.

56
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,880
- So we are not the first
brakebills students

57
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,210
to get into fillory
or to assume the throne.

58
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,480
- It's a great question
for history class,

59
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,520
but if the beast gets to
the wellspring right now

60
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,220
and sucks it bone-dry,
magic dies in fillory.

61
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,560
It dies there...
- it dies here.

62
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,500
On earth.

63
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,930
My god.

64
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,930
- So the battle magic
that this student learned here,

65
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,700
he learned from a professor
named bigby.

66
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,340
Have you heard of him?
- Her.

67
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,710
- Well, there is a note in here.

68
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,910
There's a spell that seems
strong enough

69
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,540
called the rhinemann ultra...

70
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,580
- right, but the spell
isn't actually here.

71
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,650
- Because why should anything
be easy?

72
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,680
- Shit. Shit!
Duck!

73
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:45,750
- Who?
- Everybody!

74
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,930
- What the hell is that about?

75
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:56,630
- Uh, it's semi-not related
to any of this,

76
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:59,400
but I think I know a temp fix.

77
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,440
- All right.

78
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,670

He'll know it's you.
And a trap.

95
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,400
- You're welcome

All I do is accept
what you fight.

102
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:21,480
- Yeah.

103
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,780
Which is?
- Life is pointless.

104
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,720
The after-life
even more so.

105
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,720

these games

actually, and my friends.

they're your friends anymore.

111

And, uh, they won't
be royals long. Huh.

112
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,510
- Why?

113
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,510
- Uh, maybe you could use
a bit of help

114
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,880
with the binding principle.

115
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,650

on the castle?

116
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,880
- Did I?

117
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,650
It was so long ago.

118
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,720

Nobody wants to be obedient.

177
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,690
- I do want to serve

178
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,660
you and fillory,

179
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,930
but...

180
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,600
- But...?

181
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,740
Look, I'm okay being a king,

182
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,870
but I don't want to run a cult.

183
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,350
If anyone has a right
to speak up, it's you.

184
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,780
- There hasn't been
a truly inspiring,

185
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,750
caring ruler
since Rupert chatwin,

186
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,820
and that was so long ago,
most barely remember.

187
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,790
- Look, I'm cleaning
the place up.

188
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:57,760
I'm trying to get
some decent wine going.

189
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,760
What else is there?

190
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,800
- The people are starving.

191
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,930
- Seriously?

192
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:10,740
Oh, okay.
We should probably get on that.

193
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,110
And I'm guessing magic
probably won't do the trick.

194
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:17,740
- Magic is the problem.

195
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,910
- Oh, boy.

196

197
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:42,670

Deal.

Can you keep your shit tight
for a few more minutes?

199
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,940
- Couple minutes
is all I'll need.

200
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,080
- Drink, now.

201
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,180
- You deserting, chicken-shit
motherfucker.

202
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:58,720
- Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

- No, goddammit!
- Like lando and han. Right on.

204
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:05,730
Oh!

205
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,860
- Still got my legs.

00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,770
- Uh, so it true
what Josh was saying?

207
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:16,740
Fillory's real, right?
Right?

208
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,770
- Fillory is very real.

209
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:21,010
- Okay.

210
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:24,780
And this is going to be
on the syllabus next semester?

211
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,750
- We shall see.
But for now,

212
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:30,050
Quentin, Alice, penny,
and margo need battle magic.

213
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:32,920
- We're going to teach
battle magic now?

214
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,790
- It was once a required course.

215
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,760
- Till it was outlawed.

216
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,060
For good reason, I hear.

217
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:42,930
- Yes, well,
it was a very messy situation.

218
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,730
At the time,
I thought it was right,

219
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,830
but the professor
who taught it disagreed.

220
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,770
Strongly.
She was fired,

221
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:52,740
and as she was escorted
of campus, she said that...

222
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,740
- I'm sorry, Henry,
this is fascinating,

223
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,440
but why are you telling me this?

224
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,810
- The professor, bigby,

225
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,820
hinted that she hid
all the battle magic spells

226
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,050
somewhere on campus.

227
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:09,990
"You'll need them someday,"
she said,

228
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:12,930
"and me."

229
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:15,830
- Again, why?

230
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:19,930
- All the battle magic spells
are hidden in the library.

231
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:24,070
No one knows the library
better than you.

232
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,980
- Look, I'm sorry, okay?

233
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:32,050
We both are.
Seriously sorry.

234
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,050
- So where's Victoria?
- Traveling.

235
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:36,080
I don't even know
if she's on this planet anymore.

236
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,920
- Can't blame her.

237
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,920
- Spit in it.
- What is it?

238
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,860
- It's a hangover cure El and I
used when we got the shakes.

239
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,090
I amped it up with nightshade
and a couple of ativans.

240
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:50,930
Might make you a little woozy,
but it could do the trick...

241
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,970
- Temporarily.
So keep a stash on you.

242
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,840
- It is good to see you guys,
though.

243
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,370
- Fuck off.
- Okay.

244
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,990
- This one...

245
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:20,990
Is sheer, hellcat perfection.

246
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,540
- I don't give a shit
about getting him.

247
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,110
- You should.
- Look, I didn't summon him.

248
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,240
I didn't get raped by him.

249
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,580
I have no skin in this
except I want to kick your ass

250
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,150

00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,040
- You know I can't.
I need it.

It's fairly difficult
for me to confess.

302
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:48,500
And it brings me nothing but
waves of aching nausea, but...

303
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:51,070
I grew up...

304
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,540

It's coming back

- There's my girl.

impatient, stubborn,

and mercurial.
And a 500-year-old pixie.

If she's as good as her word,
and one thing she certainly

00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,440
wasn't was a liar,

327
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,210
then her book of battle magic
will be found here.

328
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:01,510
In this room.
- Why?

329
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,610
- She told me.
"The battle magic will be

330
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:05,380
"where the knowledge always is.

331
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,480

it will be
your last hope."

333
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,550
- Uh, those were
here exact words, "last hope."

334
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,520
- Yes.

335
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,520
- Well, that's the name of one

336
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,390
of the more powerful texts
on battle magic.

337

"Last hope options."

338
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:22,630

Especially those
that make humans look stupid.

00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,300
It would burn anyone else
to a crisp.

527
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:35,000
I can feel your power.
It's almost...

528
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,300
It's almost god-like.

529
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,810
Did you fuck one of them?

530
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:42,210
I mean, they are wonderful,
aren't they?

531
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:43,780
At least mine was.

532
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,310
I glowed for weeks.
No, literally.

533
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,480
- I actually got mine
a little differently.

534
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,150
- Yes, and it's waning.
Quite quickly.

535
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:53,550
And so, bigby, if you could
just please give us the spell.

536
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:57,860
- I don't give anything, Henry.
You of all people know that.

537
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:01,360
So... Well, convince me.

538
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:07,200
- Where the hell
is the burnt river?

539
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,570
Apologies for last night,
dear wife.

540
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:16,880
- None required, my lord.

541
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,550
- I will need to find some way
to blow off steam.

542
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,820
Somehow, someday.
But in the meantime,

543
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:26,850
I get to stroll
the wondrous memory fields

544
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:29,590
of my agrarian childhood...

545
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:33,130
Sprinkling shit.

546
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:35,590
- Sprinkling... Shit?

547
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,130
- Shoveling, mixing,
drying, hauling.

548
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,870
- Sorry.

549
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:43,270
Sprinkling it on... What?

550
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,840
- Crops.

551
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,610
- Oh.

552
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:51,540
- Fertilizer?

553
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,880
Your farmers don't fertilize?

554
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:02,150
- So it's the only thing we've
found that might stop the beast.

555
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,060
I mean, it was amazing
reading about how

556
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,290
you used the rhinemann
at gettysburg

557
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:07,090
to help win the war
for the union.

558
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:09,900
- Right. And it was you
who slipped it to Rupert chatwin

559
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,330
for the battle of the bulge.

560
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:12,900
I mean, you changed history.

561
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:16,870
- Oh, I did, yes.
Many times.

562
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:20,310
Henry, is that Juniper tree
still there?

563
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:22,980
You know,
the one by the infirmary.

564
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:27,210
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, it has the softest grass.

565
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:29,920
It feels delicious on your ass.

566
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,320
I mean, we used to sneak out
at night and,

567
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,950
oh, for hours we would...

568
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:34,650
- bigby, please.

569
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:37,160
- Are you telling me you don't
even remember that tree?

570
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,930
- Of course I do, darling.
Of course.

571
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,630
But it's private.

572
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:44,000
Well, not anymore.

573
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,100
Plus, these two fuck
like jackrabbits.

574
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,930
I mean, you can just smell it.

575
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,340
- Ahem.
- And it is delicious, darling.

576
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,670
- Bigby,
we really are in a time crunch.

577
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,240
- Mm-hmm.
- There's a lot at stake.

578
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,680
- Which I told you
would be the case someday, hmm.

579
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,680
Well, welcome to someday.

580
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:08,420
Ahem.

581
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:15,660
♪ ♪

582
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:20,330
no one but you can be
within 20 feet of the blast.

583
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:23,940
It will kill anyone,
including your beast.

584
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:28,070
As strong as he is,
you're stronger.

585
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,440
But not for long.
Hmm.

586
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:37,020
So, stop prattling
and get to it.

587
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,420
- Boys, the shit.

588
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:47,330
- Um, sire, I do not wish
to appear ungrateful...

589
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:50,360
- you're just going to have
to trust your king on this one.

590
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:04,280
Come on, lads.
Many a farm to grace...

591
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:09,150
With our royal dung.

592
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:10,980
- Yah!

593
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:27,030
Ow.

594
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:28,470
Shit.

595
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:30,600
The time is 10:58 P.M.

596
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:37,180
- Alice, you're getting it,
but...

597
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,340
- It's taking too long.

598
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,750
I'm not as strong as I was.

599
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,320
By the time
I'm fully powered up,

600
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,180
the beast will have eaten
all of our faces off.

601
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,320
- You all are going to need
something strong

602
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,490
to hit him with.

603
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:50,560
- Bigby isn't the only one

604
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:54,030
who tucked away a few secrets.

605
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,070
- Ah, ow!
- Sorry.

606
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:03,200
The spell says
it has to be tight.

607
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,070
- Do they have to be behind me?
I feel like I'm getting busted.

608
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:09,040
- You can't look at your hands
for 12 hours.

609
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:12,480
- Okay, whoa, what is that?

610
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,810
- I can't pronounce the name.

611
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,480
It's from China.

612
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,580
It'll keep the blood
circulating,

613
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:22,590
but take away
a lot of the discomfort.

614
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:26,060
- Wait, that feels... ah!

615
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:32,560
O...Kay.

616
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,600
I'm wondering if maybe you could

617
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,570
rub a little into my shoulder.

618
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:41,410
Yeah, I got a cramp.

619
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:43,240
- Which one?

620
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,340
- Both, actually.

621
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:23,520
I feel guilty.

622
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,420
- Why?

623
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:28,520
- Letting you do all the work.

624
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,560
- I don't mind.

625
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:37,130
- Still, if there's anything
I can do for you, let me know.

626
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:41,430
- I don't think you're in
a position to do much.

627
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,570
- Try me.

628
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:47,510
- I might.

629
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:49,370
After you graduate.

630
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,860
- Jules.
- Q, hey.

631
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,190
- Hey.

632
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,630
Hey, um...

633
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:12,560
- I-i got your message
in my bathroom mirror.

634
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,470
It was freaky.

635
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:16,540
- Look, um, I'm not supposed
to tell you

636
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,200
what I'm gonna tell you.

637
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,670
- Okay, fine. Don't.

638
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:23,380
- I just...
I-i have to warn you.

639
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,340
You could die if you don't
get clear of the beast.

640
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,910
- You think I don't know
how dangerous he is?

641
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:30,250
- No, not him. Us.
We're going to kill him.

642
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:32,580
- Do what you want with him
but not until I get Reynard.

643
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:35,450
- No, we can't wait.

644
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,620
- You won't...
- No, Jules, we can't.

645
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,720
I-I know that you're hurting.
I just...

646
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:42,560
I-I need you to see
that this is bigger than you.

647
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,630
The beast,
he's killing magic everywhere.

648
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,430
- And Reynard is killing
people everywhere.

649
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,230
Do you think that
that's less important?

650
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,570
- No, I just think that what
you want here is revenge and...

651
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:54,970
- and you don't?

652
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:58,440
- Just don't be within
20 feet of the beast

653
00:36:58,450 --> 00:36:59,710
when we make our move, okay?

654
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,450
- Do it before I get Reynard,

655
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:04,320
you better not be
within 20 miles of me.

656
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:09,290
- I came here to warn you
and you're threatening me.

657
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:16,430
Look, I did what I had to do.
I...

658
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:19,400
Make up your own mind.

659
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,000
- There's something.

660
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,600
About the castle.
He... he made some kind of joke.

661
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,270
He put a curse on it.

662
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:29,240
Anyone who assumes the throne.

663
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,780
- What kind of curse?

664
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,950
- He wouldn't say.

665
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,680
But I'm pretty sure
it's no joke.

666
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,550
- Okay, vague.

667
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,550
Mildly helpful, I guess.

668
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:43,790
- It's all I got.

669
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:47,660
- Thank you.

670
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,560
- Sure.

671
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,660
- This is...

672
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,430
- I know.

673
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:01,540
- Okay, I'll see you
when I see you.

674
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,280
- See you.

675
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,840
- Wow.

676
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,310
I owe you for real.

677
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:52,390
- Good. Now this is going
to take just a few minutes

678
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:53,630
to fully power up.

679
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,830
You all are going to need
something strong

680
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,830
to hold off the beast.

681
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:00,330
Step one...

682
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:02,630
Is for all of you

683
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,840
to get very, very drunk.

684
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,640
- Why?
- You'll see.

685
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,110
Chug-a-lug.

686
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:13,680
- As you grow,
your name will become

687
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,510
an important part of you.

688
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,680
Even the shape of the letters
will connect with your will,

689
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,620
your unique abilities.

690
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:28,660
- Well, I can never get buried
in a Jewish cemetery.

691
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:32,530
- Are you even Jewish?
- No, but options.

692
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:35,670
- How much do I have to drink
so that I never have to hear

693
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:37,670
your voice again?
- Good.

694
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,670
Now for the painful part.

695
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,570
- That wasn't the painful part?

696
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:44,910
- Oh, no.
Professor li?

697
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:08,830
- This is a cacodemon.

698
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,740
- Jesus.
- They'll grow much bigger.

699
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,440
Unleash these and believe me,

700
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,610
they'll keep the beast
plenty busy.

701
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:16,840
Each of you will be given
a special word

702
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,840
to command your cacodemon
to attack.

703
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,850
They're a one-shot weapon,

704
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:22,710
so pick your moment with care.

705
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,450
- What are you, uh,
gonna do with it?

706
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:28,950
- Lift your shirt, Quentin,
and turn around.

707
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,620
- Oh.

708
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,960
Those words never led
to anything good.

709
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,690
Well, almost never.

710
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,580
- Right, next.

711
00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:00,890
- Sire, it's working.

712
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:03,620
- Oh, great.

713
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:06,620
Mm, thank you.
- Thank you, my king.

714
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,660
- No, no. Thank the hell
that was my childhood.

715
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:16,630
Oh, well,

716
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,000
Perfect timing, for once.

717
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,470
Ahem.

718
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:29,010
Your high king has agricultural
tales to tell.

719
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:32,720
I give you the reign of...

720
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,950
King shit.

721
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:42,830
