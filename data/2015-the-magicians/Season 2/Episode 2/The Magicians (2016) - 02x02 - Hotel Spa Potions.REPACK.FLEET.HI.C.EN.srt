This is a Brakebills student workbook.

I'm not blind, Quentin, technically.

54
00:02:49,485 --> 00:02:52,452

means that a Brakebills student

55
00:02:52,488 --> 00:02:55,656
was in Fillory over a hundred years ago.

56
00:02:55,691 --> 00:02:58,158

access to the armory were...

57

Own it, pumpkin. The Monarchy.

58
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,331

but if The Beast gets to
the Wellspring right now

62
00:03:11,907 --> 00:03:15,475

- Have you heard of him?
- Her.

69
00:03:29,658 --> 00:03:33,080

70
00:03:33,779 --> 00:03:35,695

00:28:39,895 --> 00:28:41,979
Well, if the stuffed shirts
and ninny nay-sayers

533
00:28:42,014 --> 00:28:44,381
hadn't outlawed Battle Magic
38 years ago,

534
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:47,651
then they would have it,
which you well know, Henry.

535
00:28:50,623 --> 00:28:52,623
You look hungry.

536
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,427
So why was Battle Magic outlawed?

537
00:28:56,495 --> 00:29:00,505
[sighs] Humans least
attractive qualities.

538
00:29:00,933 --> 00:29:03,904
Panic and paranoia.

539
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:07,003
And there were several student
deaths that semester.

540
00:29:07,139 --> 00:29:09,650
Far fewer than the 1870s,

541
00:29:09,675 --> 00:29:11,971
or the 1920s, or the '60s.

542
00:29:12,378 --> 00:29:14,979
Another human failing, short memory.

543
00:29:17,783 --> 00:29:19,407
Hmm.

544
00:29:19,885 --> 00:29:22,782
You'd be the one casting. Good.

545
00:29:22,955 --> 00:29:25,649
It would burn anyone else to a crisp.

546
00:29:26,626 --> 00:29:29,988
I can feel your power. It's almost...

547
00:29:30,263 --> 00:29:33,799
[chuckles]
it's almost god-like.

548
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,197
Did you fuck one of them?

549
00:29:35,222 --> 00:29:37,468
I mean, they are wonderful, aren't they?

550
00:29:37,503 --> 00:29:38,736
At least mine was.

551
00:29:38,771 --> 00:29:41,713
I glowed for weeks. No, literally.

552
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,641
I actually got mine
a little differently.

553
00:29:43,676 --> 00:29:46,443
Yes, and it's waning. Quite quickly.

554
00:29:46,566 --> 00:29:48,946
And so, Bigby, if you could
just please give us the spell.

555
00:29:48,981 --> 00:29:51,964
I don't give anything, Henry.
You of all people know that.

556
00:29:52,847 --> 00:29:54,549
So...

557
00:29:54,846 --> 00:29:57,142

Apologies for last night, dear wife.

560

None required, my lord.

561
00:30:11,937 --> 00:30:15,426
I will need to find some way
to blow off steam.

562
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:18,008
Somehow, someday. But in the meantime,

563
00:30:18,044 --> 00:30:21,856
I get to stroll
the wondrous memory fields

564
00:30:21,881 --> 00:30:24,215
of my agrarian childhood...

565
00:30:24,677 --> 00:30:27,099
sprinkling shit.

566
00:30:28,487 --> 00:30:30,661
Sprinkling... shit?

567
00:30:30,686 --> 00:30:33,424
Shoveling, mixing, drying, hauling.

568
00:30:33,459 --> 00:30:34,925
Sorry.

569
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,654
Sprinkling it on... what?

570
00:30:38,382 --> 00:30:40,582
Crops.

571
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,549
Oh.

572
00:30:42,868 --> 00:30:45,072
Fertilizer?

573
00:30:46,795 --> 00:30:49,740
Your farmers don't fertilize?

574
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:57,122
So it's the only thing we've
found that might stop The Beast.

575
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:59,161
I mean, it was amazing reading about how

576
00:30:59,186 --> 00:31:01,981
you used the Rhinemann at Gettysburg
to help win the war for the Union.

577
00:31:02,006 --> 00:31:04,676
Right. And it was you
who slipped it to Rupert Chatwin

578
00:31:04,694 --> 00:31:06,427
for the Battle of the Bulge.

579
00:31:06,463 --> 00:31:07,862
I mean, you changed history.

580
00:31:07,887 --> 00:31:10,464
Oh, I did, yes. Many times.

581
00:31:11,701 --> 00:31:15,308
Henry, is that juniper tree still there?

582
00:31:15,472 --> 00:31:17,830
You know, the one by the infirmary.

583
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:22,310
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, it has the softest grass.

584
00:31:22,345 --> 00:31:24,603
It feels delicious on your ass.

585
00:31:24,714 --> 00:31:26,447
I mean, we used to sneak out
at night and,

586
00:31:26,483 --> 00:31:29,680
- oh, for hours we would...
- Bigby, please.

587
00:31:29,705 --> 00:31:32,220
Are you telling me you don't
even remember that tree?

588
00:31:32,255 --> 00:31:34,956
Of course I do, darling. Of course.

589
00:31:34,991 --> 00:31:36,824
- But it's private.

I mean, you can just smell it.

593
00:31:42,905 --> 00:31:45,466
- Ahem.
- And it is delicious, darling.

594
00:31:45,502 --> 00:31:47,806
Bigby, we really are in a time crunch.

595
00:31:47,831 --> 00:31:49,017
- Mm-hmm.
- There's a lot at stake.

596
00:31:49,042 --> 00:31:51,906

would be the case someday, hmm.

708
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,467
your unique abilities.

709
00:39:13,492 --> 00:39:17,856
[groaning]

710
00:39:17,891 --> 00:39:20,985
Well, I can never get buried
in a Jewish cemetery.

711
00:39:21,194 --> 00:39:25,155
- Are you even Jewish?
- No, but options.

712
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:28,048
How much do I have to drink
so that I never have to hear

713
00:39:28,073 --> 00:39:30,201
- your voice again?
- Good.

714
00:39:30,226 --> 00:39:32,393
Now for the painful part.

715
00:39:32,439 --> 00:39:34,182
That wasn't the painful part?

716
00:39:34,207 --> 00:39:37,318
Oh, no. Professor Li?

717
00:39:54,261 --> 00:39:57,195
[chittering]

718
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:01,428
This is a Cacodemon.

719
00:40:01,834 --> 00:40:03,701
- Jesus.
- They'll grow much bigger.

720
00:40:03,787 --> 00:40:07,238
Unleash these and believe me,
they'll keep The Beast plenty busy.

721
00:40:07,428 --> 00:40:11,397
Each of you will be given a special word
to command your Cacodemon to attack.

722
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,586
They're a one-shot weapon,

723
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:15,444
so pick your moment with care.

724
00:40:15,615 --> 00:40:18,403
What are you, uh, gonna do with it?

725
00:40:19,085 --> 00:40:21,853
Lift your shirt, Quentin,
and turn around.

726
00:40:21,888 --> 00:40:23,254
Oh.

727
00:40:23,396 --> 00:40:25,724
Those words never led to anything good.

728
00:40:25,892 --> 00:40:28,240
Well, almost never.

729
00:40:28,562 --> 00:40:31,496
- [chittering]
- [screaming]

730
00:40:36,803 --> 00:40:39,737
[screaming]

731
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:43,269
[panting]

732
00:40:43,369 --> 00:40:45,336
Right, next.

733
00:40:50,217 --> 00:40:53,528
Sire, it's working.

734
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:55,372
Oh, great.

735
00:40:55,699 --> 00:40:58,700
- Mm, thank you.
- Thank you, my King.

736
00:40:59,259 --> 00:41:02,260
No, no. Thank the hell
that was my childhood.

737
00:41:02,295 --> 00:41:04,395
[whooshing]

738
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,286
Oh, well, [clears throat]

739
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:12,153
perfect timing, for once.

740
00:41:12,702 --> 00:41:14,635
[clears throat]

741
00:41:17,777 --> 00:41:21,484
Your High King has agricultural
tales to tell.

742
00:41:21,915 --> 00:41:24,780
I give you the reign of...

743
00:41:25,352 --> 00:41:26,970
King Shit.

744
00:41:27,854 --> 00:41:30,306
[knocking]

745
00:41:31,256 --> 00:41:34,463

be dead without me, so...
