42

But the actual
spells aren't here.

You're alive. What
a lovely surprise.

50
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:39,152
QUENTIN: Okay, so...

51
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:44,364
The castle armory was
basically empty, except for this.

52
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,627
This is a Brakebills
student workbook.

53
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:50,330
I'm not blind,
Quentin. Technically.

54
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:51,732
From 1893.

55
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:54,570
So, I guess that means that a
Brakebills student was in Fillory,

56
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,610
uh, over 100 years ago.

57
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,917
And the only humans that had
access to the Armory were...

58
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:02,373
Own it, pumpkin. The Monarchy.

59
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,212
So, we're not the first
Brakebills students

60
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,686
to get into Fillory or
to assume the throne.

61
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,087
It's a great question
for history class,

62
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:12,744
but if The Beast gets to
the Wellspring right now

63
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:14,489
and sucks it bone dry,

64
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:17,526
magic dies in
Fillory. It dies there...

65
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:21,125
It dies here. On Earth.

66
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,194
My God.

67
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:26,604
So, the battle magic that
this student learned here,

68
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,233
he learned from a
professor named Bigby.

69
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:29,388
Have you heard of him? Her.

70
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,446
Well, there is a note in here.

71
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:38,341
There's a spell that seems strong
enough, called the Rhinemann Ultra.

72
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,478
Right. But the spell
isn't actually here.

73
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,079
Because why should
anything be easy?

74
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,386

Well, if the stuffed shirts
and ninny naysayers

524
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:49,588
hadn't outlawed battle
magic 38 years ago,

525
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:52,290
then they would have it.
Which you well know, Henry.

526
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:57,097
You look hungry.

527
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:01,506
QUENTIN: So, why was
battle magic outlawed?

528
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:04,802
Ugh. Humans' least
attractive qualities.

529
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:08,703
Panic and paranoia.

530
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:12,284
And there were several
student deaths that semester.

531
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:14,684
BIGBY: Far fewer than the 1870s,

532
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,915
or the 1920s, or the '60s.

533
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:19,958
Another human
failing. Short memory.

534
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:21,118
Mmm.

535
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,123
Hmm.

536
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:27,532
You'd be the one casting? Good.

537
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:29,895
It'd burn anyone
else to a crisp.

538
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:34,571
I can feel your
power. It's almost...

539
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:40,178
(LAUGHS) It's almost godlike.
Did you fuck one of them?

540
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:42,271
I mean, they are
wonderful, aren't they?

541
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:46,648
Or at least mine was. I
glowed for weeks. No, literally.

542
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:48,346
I actually got mine
a little differently.

543
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:51,356
Yes, and it's
waning. Quite quickly.

544
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:53,851
So, Bigby, if you could
just please give us the spell.

545
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:56,861
I don't give anything, Henry.
You of all people know that.

546
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:01,161
So, well, convince me.

00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:06,769
Where the hell is
the burned river?

549
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:13,303
Apologies for last
night, dear wife.

550
00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:15,742
None required, My Lord.

551
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:20,577
I will need to find some
way to blow off steam.

552
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,850
Somehow, someday, but
in the meantime, I get to

553
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:28,652
stroll the wondrous memory
fields of my agrarian childhood.

554
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:31,389
Sprinkling shit.

555
00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:35,592
"Sprinkling shit"?

556
00:30:35,734 --> 00:30:38,363
Shoveling, mixing,
drying, hauling.

557
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:42,497
Sorry, sprinkling it on what?

558
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:44,999
Crops.

559
00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:46,837
Oh...

560
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:49,146
Fertilizer?

561
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:54,648
Your farmers don't fertilize?

562
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:02,150
ALICE: So, it's the only thing we've
found that might stop The Beast.

563
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:03,957
I mean, it was
amazing reading about

564
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:05,589
how you used the
Rhinemann at Gettysburg

565
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,208
to help win the war for
the Union. QUENTIN: Right.

566
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:09,701
And it was you who
slipped it to Rupert Chatwin

567
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:10,888
for the Battle of the Bulge.

568
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,902
I mean, you changed history.

569
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:15,064
I did. Yes. Many times.

570
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:20,403
Henry, is that
juniper tree still there?

571
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:22,573
You know, the one
by the infirmary?

572
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:27,312
Oh, yes. Oh! It has
the softest grass.

573
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:29,719
It feels delicious on your ass.

574
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:33,122
I mean, we used to sneak out at
night and, oh, for hours, we would...

575
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:34,682
Bigby. Please.

576
00:31:34,793 --> 00:31:37,319
BIGBY: Are you telling me you
don't even remember that tree?

577
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:41,128
Of course I do, darling.
Of course. But it's private.

I mean, you can just smell
it. (DEAN CLEARS THROAT)

582
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:50,400
And it is delicious, darling.

583
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:53,240
Bigby, we really are in a
time crunch. Mmm-hmm.

584
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:54,370
There's a lot at stake.

the case someday. Hmm?

It's taking too long. I'm
not as strong as I was.

603
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,464
By the time I'm
fully powered up,

604
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:45,457
The Beast will have
eaten all of our faces off.

605
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:48,460
DEAN: You all are going to need
something strong to hit him with.

tucked away a few secrets.

Sorry, spell says
it has to be tight.

609

Do they have to be behind
me? I feel like I'm getting busted.

610

You can't look at your
hands for 12 hours.

611
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:13,975
Okay, what is that? I
can't pronounce the name.

612
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,213
It's from China.

613
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,917
It'll keep the blood circulating

614
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,653
but take away a
lot of the discomfort.

615
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:24,519

00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:30,502

could rub a little into my shoulder.

Both, actually.

I feel guilty.

622
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:24,912
Why?

Letting you do all the work.

do for you, let me know.

a position to do much.

to warn you. Uh...

get clear of The Beast.

How much do I
have to drink so that

698
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:36,833
I never have to hear
your voice again?

699
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:39,807
DEAN: Good. Now,
for the painful part.

700
00:39:40,278 --> 00:39:42,474
That wasn't the
painful part? Oh, no.

701
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:44,572
Professor Li?

(CREATURE SQUEALING)

704
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:08,738
This is a cacodemon.

705
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,440
Jesus. DEAN: They'll
grow much bigger.

706
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:14,673
Unleash these and, believe me,
they'll keep The Beast plenty busy.

707
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:16,773
Each of you will be
given a special word

708
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:18,442
to command your
cacodemon to attack.

709
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,216
They are a one-shot weapon.

710
00:40:21,286 --> 00:40:22,914
So, pick your moment with care.

711
00:40:23,288 --> 00:40:25,723
What are you, uh,
gonna do with it?

712
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:29,360
Lift your shirt, Quentin,
and turn around.

713
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:30,618
Oh!

714
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:33,392
Those words never
led to anything good.

715
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:35,365
Well, almost never.

DEAN: Right. Next.

719
00:40:57,922 --> 00:41:00,892
Sire, it's working.

720
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,487
Oh, great.

721
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:05,396
Mmm, thank you.
Thank you, My King.

722
00:41:06,998 --> 00:41:09,729
No, no, thank the hell
that was my childhood.

Perfect timing. For once.

Your High King has
agricultural tales to tell.

I give you the reign of...
