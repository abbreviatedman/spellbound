1
00:00:00,327 --> 00:00:02,327
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:02,328 --> 00:00:04,165
I hesitated, but The Beast,
I should have...

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,647
- it's my fault.
- No, it's not.

4
00:00:06,819 --> 00:00:09,220
It's Julia's fault.

5
00:00:09,255 --> 00:00:10,888
You know how to deal with gods.

6
00:00:10,923 --> 00:00:12,890
You know how to fuck up their shit.

7
00:00:12,925 --> 00:00:15,327
- Julia, no.
- I want to make a deal.

8
00:00:15,352 --> 00:00:18,091
No, guys, she... she's not sane.

9
00:00:18,116 --> 00:00:20,434
One small consolation is
the bitch is with The Beast

10
00:00:20,469 --> 00:00:23,103
right now and I can't really see
that going her way.

11
00:00:23,138 --> 00:00:24,905
Word as bond.

12
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,420
I assume the extra bits
enchant the blade

13
00:00:27,476 --> 00:00:30,711
to kill me instantly
in the event I break it.

14
00:00:30,746 --> 00:00:32,112
You guys are from Brakebills?

15
00:00:32,148 --> 00:00:35,549
Dude, Josh Hoberman, class of '16.

16
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:37,317
Come with me if you want to live.

17
00:00:37,353 --> 00:00:40,521
Yeah, Josh and Victoria
bailed, on one hand.

18
00:00:40,556 --> 00:00:43,490
On the other hand,
you can't really blame them.

19
00:00:43,526 --> 00:00:44,964
I'm Marina.

20
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:47,995
- So you were...
- Top bitch in New York for starters.

21
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,898
- Welcome back to Brakebills.
- Wait, you went here?

22
00:00:50,933 --> 00:00:53,033
Kicked out three months
before graduation.

23
00:00:53,068 --> 00:00:55,869
- Let's go steal their shit.
- So there's a bump.

24
00:00:55,905 --> 00:00:58,205
Bigger than marrying
a total stranger-ette?

25
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,541
Once you get married,
you won't be able to be

26
00:01:00,576 --> 00:01:02,409
with anyone else, literally.

27
00:01:02,444 --> 00:01:05,012
But when I go back...

28
00:01:05,047 --> 00:01:07,214
I can never leave Fillory.

29
00:01:07,249 --> 00:01:10,517
Please fix my hands.

30
00:01:10,553 --> 00:01:13,220
See, how do I put this
in a way that you'll understand?

31
00:01:13,255 --> 00:01:15,722
Go fuck yourself.

32
00:01:15,758 --> 00:01:18,091
According to the best
and only magic we have,

33
00:01:18,127 --> 00:01:20,594
The Beast will kill us, end of story.

34
00:01:20,629 --> 00:01:22,729
Okay, zillion bucks
says The Beast comes back

35
00:01:22,765 --> 00:01:24,531
any minute, so what's the plan?

36
00:01:24,567 --> 00:01:27,701
We lost the blade,
so we need a new something,

37
00:01:27,736 --> 00:01:29,203
especially while Alice is still...

38
00:01:29,238 --> 00:01:31,338
Watch your step...
wait, this is something.

39
00:01:31,373 --> 00:01:34,541
It's a workbook on spells, serious ones,

40
00:01:34,577 --> 00:01:36,043
but the actual spells aren't here.

41
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:38,178
I know where we need to go.

42
00:01:38,214 --> 00:01:40,071
Brakebills?

43
00:01:56,565 --> 00:02:00,734
I don't get it. How come nobody
in a hood is trying to kill us?

44
00:02:06,842 --> 00:02:09,142
Okay, that's just weird.

45
00:02:09,178 --> 00:02:12,112
You want to stop and
figure it out, be my guest.

46
00:02:29,331 --> 00:02:31,598
You're alive.

47
00:02:31,634 --> 00:02:33,567
What a lovely surprise.

48
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:38,841
Okay, so...

49
00:02:39,036 --> 00:02:44,122
the castle armory was
basically empty, except for this.

50
00:02:44,446 --> 00:02:46,647
This is a Brakebills student workbook.

51
00:02:46,682 --> 00:02:49,449
I'm not blind, Quentin, technically.

52
00:02:49,485 --> 00:02:52,452
From 1893, so I guess that
means that a Brakebills student

53
00:02:52,488 --> 00:02:55,656
was in Fillory over a hundred years ago.

54
00:02:55,691 --> 00:02:58,158
And the only humans that had
access to the armory were...

55
00:02:58,193 --> 00:03:01,595
Own it, pumpkin. The Monarchy.

56
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:04,331
So we are not the first
Brakebills students

57
00:03:04,366 --> 00:03:06,500
to get into Fillory
or to assume the throne.

58
00:03:06,535 --> 00:03:08,802
It's a great question for history class,

59
00:03:08,837 --> 00:03:11,872
but if The Beast gets to
the Wellspring right now

60
00:03:11,907 --> 00:03:15,475
and sucks it bone-dry,
magic dies in Fillory.

61
00:03:15,511 --> 00:03:19,112
- It dies there...
- It dies here.

62
00:03:19,148 --> 00:03:21,848
On Earth.

63
00:03:21,884 --> 00:03:23,383
My God.

64
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:25,673
So the Battle Magic
that this student learned here,

65
00:03:25,698 --> 00:03:27,352
he learned from a professor named Bigby.

66
00:03:27,377 --> 00:03:29,623
- Have you heard of him?
- Her.

67
00:03:29,658 --> 00:03:33,080
Well, there is a note in here.

68
00:03:33,779 --> 00:03:35,695
There's a spell that seems strong enough

69
00:03:35,731 --> 00:03:37,430
called the Rhinemann Ultra...

70
00:03:37,466 --> 00:03:39,466
Right, but the spell
isn't actually here.

71
00:03:39,501 --> 00:03:41,334
Because why should anything be easy?

72
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,603
Shit. Shit! Duck!

73
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,672
- Who?
- Everybody!

74
00:03:49,378 --> 00:03:52,712
What the hell is that about?

75
00:03:52,748 --> 00:03:56,516
Uh, it's semi-not related
to any of this,

76
00:03:56,551 --> 00:03:59,019
but I think I know a temp fix.

77
00:03:59,054 --> 00:04:02,022
All right.

78
00:04:02,057 --> 00:04:03,123
I'll get back to you.

Okay, is that an actual song

87
00:04:33,263 --> 00:04:36,923

You mind? I'm working.

93
00:04:55,977 --> 00:04:58,945
It's still too similar to the
first sigil that summoned him.

94
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,948
He'll know it's you. And a trap.

95
00:05:01,983 --> 00:05:03,950
You're welcome to have an actual idea.

96
00:05:03,985 --> 00:05:06,386
Oh, no, I'd ruin your primitive purity.

97
00:05:06,421 --> 00:05:07,887
That's part of what attracts him.

98
00:05:07,923 --> 00:05:09,889
You're an absolute savage, Julia.

99
00:05:09,925 --> 00:05:12,058
Look, I know you're basically
stoned on sugar,

100
00:05:12,094 --> 00:05:13,893
but if you could just
dial down the chipper...

101
00:05:15,063 --> 00:05:18,131
All I do is accept what you fight.

102
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:19,999
Yeah.

103
00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:23,554
- Which is?
- Life is pointless.

104
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:25,538
The after-life even more so.

105
00:05:25,574 --> 00:05:27,460
Which is why we invent these games

106
00:05:27,485 --> 00:05:29,442
to fill the void of existence.

107
00:05:29,478 --> 00:05:32,212
Who diddled whom.
Who'll get revenge for it.

108
00:05:32,247 --> 00:05:34,047
Who takes the throne.

109
00:05:34,082 --> 00:05:37,283
Yeah, well, that would be me,
actually, and my friends.

110
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:39,152
Ah, well, I doubt
they're your friends anymore.

111
00:05:39,187 --> 00:05:43,256
And, uh, they won't be royals long. Huh.

112
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,125
Why?

113
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,485
Uh, maybe you could use a bit of help
with the Binding Principle.

114
00:05:48,697 --> 00:05:51,064
Did you put some kind of curse
on the castle?

115
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,548
Did I?

116
00:05:53,702 --> 00:05:55,913
It was so long ago.

117
00:05:56,204 --> 00:05:58,031
I hardly remember.

118
00:06:03,101 --> 00:06:05,596
The throne room, Sire.

119
00:06:13,522 --> 00:06:16,656
Can't be that hard to find dead rats.

120
00:06:19,904 --> 00:06:21,145
Wait, wait, wait, yes.

121
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:24,561
I-I believe I did work up
a little welcome.

122
00:06:24,686 --> 00:06:28,451
Yes, since Ember made it impossible
for me to retake the throne

123
00:06:28,603 --> 00:06:30,737
and the Children of Earth
kept coming and coming,

124
00:06:30,772 --> 00:06:34,274
drunk on self-love and power-lust.

125
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:38,111
Yes, I thought of it
as a kind of royal test...

126
00:06:38,146 --> 00:06:39,979
that no one ever passed.

127
00:06:41,483 --> 00:06:42,782
Sadly.

128
00:06:42,818 --> 00:06:44,384
What kind of test?

129
00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:46,686
Ah, that's something
for each new despot to, uh,

130
00:06:46,722 --> 00:06:49,689
puzzle out themselves. Anyway.

131
00:06:49,725 --> 00:06:51,558
You're on the right track.

132
00:06:51,593 --> 00:06:54,961
Now we just need the bait.

133
00:06:54,996 --> 00:06:58,665
As soon as I'm finished
with this, I'm ready.

134
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,800
He knows you.

135
00:07:00,836 --> 00:07:03,136
A bit too intimately.

136
00:07:03,171 --> 00:07:06,639
No, I have the perfect fresh candidate.

137
00:07:06,675 --> 00:07:10,076
She's young, beautiful, female,
and a very powerful witch.

138
00:07:10,112 --> 00:07:12,045
No.

139
00:07:12,087 --> 00:07:13,741
- Julia.
- Let's skip the discussion.

140
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,070
You do as I say or this...

141
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,326
does its job,

142
00:07:20,757 --> 00:07:22,004
per the bond.

143
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:24,262
Oh, well, technically,
the Leo Blade cuts my throat

144
00:07:24,287 --> 00:07:26,587
if I attempt to harm you, your beloveds,

145
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,317
or undermine your efforts.

146
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,855

00:08:12,797 --> 00:08:16,599
Uh, wait, the cottage was here, right?

155
00:08:19,247 --> 00:08:22,448
It's not invisible, it's just... not.

156
00:08:22,484 --> 00:08:25,385
Oh, shit, right.

157
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,222
End of semester prank
to ditch the first-year losers.

158
00:08:29,257 --> 00:08:32,009
I should've remembered, it was my idea.

159
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:33,587
Are you...

160
00:08:33,915 --> 00:08:35,611
I hate all of you.

161
00:08:35,706 --> 00:08:38,610
- I hate all of you.
- Could we just find the cottage, please.

162
00:08:45,173 --> 00:08:48,038
Mm, promising.

163
00:08:50,111 --> 00:08:52,846
To the first bottle
of Fillorian champagne.

164
00:08:52,881 --> 00:08:54,814
Which I know technically
isn't champagne.

165
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:58,865
Except I am renaming the Royal
Gardens "Champagne Nouveau."

166
00:08:59,577 --> 00:09:02,222
Mm. Ugh.

167
00:09:02,257 --> 00:09:05,758
"Champagne no-no." Jesus.

168
00:09:05,794 --> 00:09:09,896
That makes no sense. I used the
go-to fermenting enchantment.

169
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:12,264
No fretting. I'll get it right.
Trial and error.

170
00:09:13,802 --> 00:09:17,038
I'm your wife. I want to be obedient.

171
00:09:17,172 --> 00:09:20,507
Sit down.

172
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:23,409
Nobody wants to be obedient.

173
00:09:23,445 --> 00:09:26,911
I do want to serve you and Fillory,

174
00:09:28,183 --> 00:09:30,083
but...

175
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:32,458
But...?

176
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:37,257
Look, I'm okay being a king,

177
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:40,233
but I don't want to run a cult.

178
00:09:40,462 --> 00:09:43,045
If anyone has a right
to speak up, it's you.

179
00:09:44,866 --> 00:09:48,248
There hasn't been a truly inspiring,

180
00:09:48,273 --> 00:09:50,303
caring ruler since Rupert Chatwin,

181
00:09:50,338 --> 00:09:52,372
and that was so long ago,
most barely remember.

182
00:09:52,407 --> 00:09:54,340
Look, I'm cleaning the place up.

183
00:09:54,376 --> 00:09:57,310
I'm trying to get
some decent wine going.

184
00:09:57,345 --> 00:09:59,112
What else is there?

185
00:09:59,147 --> 00:10:01,347
The people are starving.

186
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:03,316
Seriously?

187
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,800
Oh, okay.
We should probably get on that.

188
00:10:10,091 --> 00:10:13,726
And I'm guessing magic
probably won't do the trick.

189
00:10:13,762 --> 00:10:15,943
Magic is the problem.

190
00:10:17,098 --> 00:10:19,935
Oh, boy.

191
00:10:37,719 --> 00:10:41,988
Yep. We're alive. Deal.

192
00:10:42,033 --> 00:10:44,622
Can you keep your shit tight
for a few more minutes?

193
00:10:46,294 --> 00:10:48,528
Couple minutes is all I'll need.

194
00:10:48,563 --> 00:10:50,697
Drink, now.

195
00:10:50,732 --> 00:10:53,833
You deserting, chicken-shit
motherfucker.

196
00:10:53,869 --> 00:10:55,944
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

197
00:10:58,306 --> 00:11:01,774
- No, goddammit!
- Like Lando and Han. Right on.

198
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:04,811
Oh!

199
00:11:07,115 --> 00:11:09,464
Still got my legs.

200
00:11:10,452 --> 00:11:13,286
Uh, so it true what Josh was saying?

201
00:11:13,321 --> 00:11:16,055
Fillory's real, right? Right?

202
00:11:16,091 --> 00:11:18,057
Fillory is very real.

203
00:11:18,093 --> 00:11:20,593
Okay.

204
00:11:20,629 --> 00:11:24,297
And this is going to be
on the syllabus next semester?

205
00:11:24,332 --> 00:11:26,065
We shall see. But for now,

206
00:11:26,101 --> 00:11:29,636
Quentin, Alice, Penny,
and Margo need Battle Magic.

207
00:11:29,671 --> 00:11:32,472
We're going to teach Battle Magic now?

208
00:11:32,507 --> 00:11:34,307
It was once a required course.

209
00:11:34,342 --> 00:11:36,075
Till it was outlawed.

210
00:11:36,111 --> 00:11:37,644
For good reason, I hear.

211
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:42,482
Yes, well,
it was a very messy situation.

212
00:11:42,517 --> 00:11:45,051
At the time, I thought it was right,

213
00:11:45,086 --> 00:11:47,153
but the professor
who taught it disagreed.

214
00:11:47,188 --> 00:11:49,122
Strongly. She was fired,

215
00:11:49,157 --> 00:11:52,225
and as she was escorted
off campus, she said that...

216
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,240
I'm sorry, Henry, this is fascinating,

217
00:11:54,265 --> 00:11:56,963
but why are you telling me this?

218
00:11:56,998 --> 00:11:59,165
The professor, Bigby,

219
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,102
hinted that she hid
all the Battle Magic spells

220
00:12:03,138 --> 00:12:05,605
somewhere on campus.

221
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,801
"You'll need them someday," she said,

222
00:12:09,544 --> 00:12:11,567
"And me."

223
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:15,315
Again, why?

224
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:19,128
All the Battle Magic spells
are hidden in the library.

225
00:12:19,487 --> 00:12:23,042
No one knows the library
better than you.

226
00:12:26,061 --> 00:12:28,362
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

227
00:12:28,387 --> 00:12:31,488
We both are. Seriously sorry.

228
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,599
- So where's Victoria?
- Traveling.

229
00:12:33,635 --> 00:12:35,668
I don't even know
if she's on this planet anymore.

230
00:12:35,704 --> 00:12:38,438
Can't blame her.

231
00:12:38,473 --> 00:12:40,440
- Spit in it.
- What is it?

232
00:12:40,475 --> 00:12:43,176
It's a hangover cure El and I
used when we got the shakes.

233
00:12:43,211 --> 00:12:45,678
I amped it up with Nightshade
and a couple of Ativans.

234
00:12:45,714 --> 00:12:48,618
Might make you a little woozy,
but it could do the trick...

235
00:12:52,587 --> 00:12:56,522
Temporarily. So keep a stash on you.

236
00:12:56,558 --> 00:12:58,157
It is good to see you guys, though.

237
00:12:58,193 --> 00:13:00,472
- Fuck off.
- Okay.

238
00:13:14,042 --> 00:13:16,506
This one...

239
00:13:17,162 --> 00:13:20,380
is sheer, hellcat perfection.

240
00:13:27,003 --> 00:13:28,596
I don't give a shit about getting him.

241
00:13:28,792 --> 00:13:31,452
- You should.
- Look, I didn't summon him.

242
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:33,652
I didn't get raped by him.

243
00:13:33,677 --> 00:13:37,512
I have no skin in this except that
I want to kick your ass and kill him.

244
00:13:37,548 --> 00:13:40,215
♪ Fate may often treat me meanly ♪

245
00:13:40,475 --> 00:13:45,043
♪ But I keenly pursue ♪

246
00:13:45,222 --> 00:13:49,713
♪ A little mirage in the blue ♪

247
00:13:50,361 --> 00:13:52,682
Did you scrape him off
the cabaret floor?

248
00:13:52,896 --> 00:13:54,529
Reynard is targeting Hedges.

249
00:13:54,565 --> 00:13:57,432
Right. So the answer is to
hire Michael Bublé to kidnap me

250
00:13:57,468 --> 00:13:59,267
and then use me as your bait.

251
00:13:59,303 --> 00:14:01,269
If I'm wrong, raise your hand.

252
00:14:01,305 --> 00:14:03,705
Look, you're right.
It was wrong grabbing you

253
00:14:03,741 --> 00:14:06,274
the way that we did,
but sooner or later,

254
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:07,721
he was gonna find you.

255
00:14:07,878 --> 00:14:10,612
- We need someone...
- Else, Julia.

256
00:14:10,647 --> 00:14:12,852
Or we have a problem.

257
00:14:12,983 --> 00:14:15,180
Do you want a problem with me?

258
00:14:17,254 --> 00:14:19,221
- Forget it.
- Great.

259
00:14:23,794 --> 00:14:25,961
I told you untying her was a mistake.

260
00:14:29,266 --> 00:14:32,300
- Ow.
- What?

261
00:14:32,336 --> 00:14:35,070
It's starting to burn a little.

262
00:14:35,105 --> 00:14:36,471
Take it off.

263
00:14:36,507 --> 00:14:39,374
You know I can't. I need it.

264
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:42,344
The more it burns,
the less time we have.

265
00:14:44,448 --> 00:14:45,981
If it hurts, then...

266
00:14:46,016 --> 00:14:48,950
Not everything that hurts is bad.

267
00:14:52,423 --> 00:14:56,591
I hate that all of this is on you.

268
00:14:56,627 --> 00:15:00,228
You'd tell me if there was
something I could do.

269
00:15:00,264 --> 00:15:02,582
Shift the weight off?

270
00:15:04,868 --> 00:15:07,035
Yeah, I'd tell you.

271
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,104
Look, she's a bitch on three wheels,

272
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:32,237
probably bat-shit crazy,
but she's not wrong.

273
00:15:32,362 --> 00:15:34,596
Did you find it?

274
00:15:34,631 --> 00:15:37,099
I did. And?

275
00:15:37,134 --> 00:15:38,767
Look, I know we made a pact.

276
00:15:38,802 --> 00:15:41,103
I stick to my coast, you stick to yours.

277
00:15:41,138 --> 00:15:43,105
But this might take
all the top Hedge bitches

278
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,474
to coven up and take this asshole out.

279
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:47,185
Your coast or mine?

280
00:15:47,578 --> 00:15:49,511
I'm already on my way.

281
00:15:55,052 --> 00:15:59,621
So, if I'm understanding this,
things here grow magically.

282
00:15:59,761 --> 00:16:01,456
Until recently, yes.

283
00:16:01,558 --> 00:16:03,728
Everything always took care of itself.

284
00:16:03,907 --> 00:16:06,135
We used to grow all the nuts
in the southern region.

285
00:16:06,163 --> 00:16:08,392
Until The Beast drained the magic.

286
00:16:08,532 --> 00:16:11,416
Now what's required is actual farm work.

287
00:16:11,633 --> 00:16:15,168
Which no one in Fillory knows how to do.

288
00:16:17,908 --> 00:16:22,177
Ah, I think I'm getting
one of those migraines

289
00:16:22,212 --> 00:16:25,101
where everything gets all bendy.

290
00:16:25,867 --> 00:16:27,523
Please God, let me pass out.

291
00:16:29,353 --> 00:16:32,322
No? All right.

292
00:16:32,856 --> 00:16:34,789
Fen?

293
00:16:38,061 --> 00:16:39,561
I have a secret.

294
00:16:39,596 --> 00:16:41,530
It's fairly difficult for me to confess.

295
00:16:41,565 --> 00:16:45,837
And it brings me nothing but
waves of aching nausea, but...

296
00:16:47,115 --> 00:16:48,446
I grew up...

297
00:16:49,373 --> 00:16:50,872
on a farm.

298
00:16:51,022 --> 00:16:52,721
That's your secret?

299
00:16:52,746 --> 00:16:54,894
I spent years blocking it all out.

300
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,413
The smell of wet hay.

301
00:16:58,777 --> 00:17:01,616
And the feel of an udder.

302
00:17:01,652 --> 00:17:04,476
The taste of fresh...

303
00:17:04,922 --> 00:17:06,354
goat milk.

304
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,272
And the worst humans
in the known universe:

305
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:11,734
my family.

306
00:17:12,596 --> 00:17:15,030
It's coming back
and if it all comes back,

307
00:17:15,055 --> 00:17:16,731
I'm pretty sure I'll know
exactly what to do.

308
00:17:16,767 --> 00:17:20,145
- That's wonderful.
- On a planet with no Zoloft.

309
00:17:20,304 --> 00:17:22,403
Now you sound like my king.

310
00:17:22,606 --> 00:17:24,172
Mm.

311
00:17:27,471 --> 00:17:30,312
So then, if I just needed
one little thing from you to...

312
00:17:30,347 --> 00:17:33,073
to ease my agony?

313
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,927
- Anything.
- Mm.

314
00:17:34,952 --> 00:17:36,785
There's my girl.

315
00:17:38,848 --> 00:17:41,534
_

316
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:44,726
Professor Bigby was brilliant,
impatient, stubborn,

317
00:17:44,761 --> 00:17:47,924
and mercurial. And a 500-year-old pixie.

318
00:17:48,056 --> 00:17:50,932
Who more or less saw humans
as children to be toyed with.

319
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:54,419
If she's as good as her word, and one
thing she certainly wasn't was a liar,

320
00:17:54,444 --> 00:17:57,439
then her book of Battle Magic
will be found here.

321
00:17:57,474 --> 00:17:59,774
- In this room.
- Why?

322
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:01,910
She told me. "The Battle Magic will be

323
00:18:01,945 --> 00:18:03,612
"where the knowledge always is.

324
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,827
"The day you need it, I promise,

325
00:18:05,983 --> 00:18:08,340
it will be your last hope."

326
00:18:08,485 --> 00:18:11,276
Uh, those were
here exact words, "last hope."

327
00:18:11,301 --> 00:18:12,470
Yes.

328
00:18:12,495 --> 00:18:13,933
Well, that's the name of one

329
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,657
of the more powerful texts
on Battle Magic.

330
00:18:15,692 --> 00:18:17,229
"Last Hope Options."

331
00:18:17,254 --> 00:18:20,929
Yes, of course.
Pixies love puzzles and riddles.

332
00:18:20,964 --> 00:18:23,190
Especially those
that make humans look stupid.

333
00:18:23,215 --> 00:18:25,339
She gave me the title of the
book that we're searching for,

334
00:18:25,364 --> 00:18:28,336
but I'm afraid that it will be
very hard to find.

335
00:18:28,372 --> 00:18:29,504
Let's get to it.

336
00:18:31,675 --> 00:18:33,208
"Rhinemann."

337
00:18:37,481 --> 00:18:39,314
"The Rhinemann Exchange."

338
00:18:39,349 --> 00:18:42,459
A spy novel by Robert Ludlum.

339
00:18:42,586 --> 00:18:44,155
What's next?

340
00:18:44,321 --> 00:18:47,655
"Last Hope Options" is an anagram for...

341
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,536
"Pane Hotspot Silo"?

342
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,232
All right, let's try assigning

343
00:18:58,257 --> 00:18:59,534
a different number structure
to the letters.

344
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:03,038
For instance, A is 11, B is 22,
C is 44, and so on.

345
00:19:03,115 --> 00:19:05,473
- Okay.
- Ahem.

346
00:19:05,509 --> 00:19:11,046
"Tat Loosens Hippo,"
"Opine Path Stools."

347
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,356
Pixie puzzles.

348
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:44,414
Penny, what's... what's happened
to your hands?

349
00:19:44,439 --> 00:19:46,181
What hasn't?

350
00:19:46,216 --> 00:19:48,580
- Tell me.
- Why?

351
00:19:50,721 --> 00:19:53,238
Maybe I can help.

352
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:56,066
- Nada.
- Ugh. Professor?

353
00:19:56,226 --> 00:19:58,426
I can safely say
that none of the number codes

354
00:19:58,462 --> 00:20:00,395
we came up with led to anything.

355
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:02,964
We found about 300 anagram phrases.

356
00:20:03,057 --> 00:20:04,768
Anything promising?

357
00:20:04,901 --> 00:20:07,702
Uh, well, uh,

358
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:11,010
"Hospital Nose Top" mean anything?

359
00:20:11,141 --> 00:20:14,709
What about, uh, "Latte Shop Poison"?

360
00:20:14,843 --> 00:20:17,992
No? Not surprising.

361
00:20:18,749 --> 00:20:20,281
Uh, oh, this one's good.

362
00:20:20,317 --> 00:20:23,151
This is my favorite because it's absurd.

363
00:20:23,186 --> 00:20:25,620
Uh, "Hotel Spa Potions."

364
00:20:25,655 --> 00:20:27,385
Wait.

365
00:20:27,624 --> 00:20:30,458
That's a book. In here.

366
00:20:42,305 --> 00:20:44,472
- Yeah.
- "Last Hope Options."

367
00:20:44,508 --> 00:20:45,440
Ah.

368
00:20:51,348 --> 00:20:53,532
The chapter's been ripped out.

369
00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:55,566
Wait, there's a note.

370
00:20:55,719 --> 00:20:57,449
"Hello, Henry.

371
00:20:57,687 --> 00:20:59,454
"If you're reading this, I was right

372
00:20:59,489 --> 00:21:01,689
"and everyone else
at Brakebills was wrong.

373
00:21:01,725 --> 00:21:03,291
"How delightful.

374
00:21:03,457 --> 00:21:07,829
"It also means I'll see you
quick as one, two, nine.

375
00:21:07,973 --> 00:21:10,301
"Where middle leads and last is fine,

376
00:21:10,498 --> 00:21:12,543
"summer's here and ne'er retreats,

377
00:21:13,403 --> 00:21:15,933
a pretty island made of streets."

378
00:21:16,223 --> 00:21:18,239
Another riddle. Awesome.

379
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,737
Oh. Well, if it's, like,
where to find her?

380
00:21:21,762 --> 00:21:24,168
"Island made of streets"
is Rhode Island.

381
00:21:24,714 --> 00:21:27,558
What? Duh.

382
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:37,190
Sorry. Could you spell
your last name again?

383
00:21:37,401 --> 00:21:39,698
I would, but...

384
00:21:40,651 --> 00:21:42,530
you're asleep.

385
00:22:07,103 --> 00:22:08,751
You said anything.

386
00:22:08,844 --> 00:22:11,513
But this is... this is...

387
00:22:15,445 --> 00:22:17,614
Am I not enough for you?

388
00:22:19,582 --> 00:22:21,571
You're great.

389
00:22:21,818 --> 00:22:24,318
For... who you are.

390
00:22:24,354 --> 00:22:27,915
It's just... I already told you.
My life was different before.

391
00:22:28,091 --> 00:22:29,257
Yeah.

392
00:22:29,422 --> 00:22:32,148
And I'll help you make a new life.

393
00:22:33,263 --> 00:22:35,942
Well, this is new.

394
00:22:36,014 --> 00:22:38,403
And right inside the lines of marriage.

395
00:22:38,568 --> 00:22:41,184
We just do what we do in bed,

396
00:22:41,371 --> 00:22:44,454
and they do what they do.

397
00:22:44,607 --> 00:22:46,574
I only picked people
already doing each other.

398
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,533
And we get to watch.

399
00:22:52,082 --> 00:22:53,381
You guys are all cool with this, right?

400
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:56,004
- Mm-hmm.
- See?

401
00:22:57,387 --> 00:22:59,087
You're their king.

402
00:22:59,122 --> 00:23:01,321
They will do as you wish,
no matter how...

403
00:23:01,346 --> 00:23:03,624
- Fun.
- Debased.

404
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:05,315
Debased?

405
00:23:05,462 --> 00:23:08,948
Honey-love, I've been doing
this shit since I was 12,

406
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:11,378
except on a computer.

407
00:23:11,568 --> 00:23:13,277
I don't know what that means,

408
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,160
but...

409
00:23:15,953 --> 00:23:18,363
if it's what you desire...

410
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:25,438
All right. Good night, everyone. Thanks.

411
00:23:25,556 --> 00:23:27,444
You all look really good naked.

412
00:23:27,445 --> 00:23:29,313
- Thank you, Sire.
- Your Majesty.

413
00:23:38,294 --> 00:23:42,063
Well, I guess life
is about new experiences,

414
00:23:42,127 --> 00:23:44,111
and, uh, I've never been
pussy-whipped, so...

415
00:23:51,107 --> 00:23:52,537
You're doomed.

416
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:56,342
Which I might find amusing
except it's likely

417
00:23:56,367 --> 00:23:58,420
to get me killed.

418
00:23:58,681 --> 00:24:00,865
And for what?

419
00:24:01,117 --> 00:24:03,839
Because no matter what,
I'm going to hold on to my...

420
00:24:03,864 --> 00:24:05,675
If you say "humanity"
you'll learn I can vomit

421
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,633
non-stop for two hours.

422
00:24:11,694 --> 00:24:14,225
You know, I'm about to make
an enemy of a god

423
00:24:14,364 --> 00:24:17,155
who I have no quarrel with.

424
00:24:17,433 --> 00:24:19,400
And without decent bait,
you're literally asking me

425
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:23,350
to do it blindfolded, shackled,
and hopping on one leg.

426
00:24:25,162 --> 00:24:28,764
If... if I took just a smidgen
of your Shade,

427
00:24:28,858 --> 00:24:32,381
not only would your trauma drop away,

428
00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:35,648
you'd have no issue with using Marina.

429
00:24:35,785 --> 00:24:38,553
You'd be free of these useless feelings

430
00:24:38,588 --> 00:24:41,140
and this idiotic moral quagmire.

431
00:24:41,357 --> 00:24:43,691
Come near me
and the knife won't kill you.

432
00:24:43,812 --> 00:24:46,051
'Cause you can still live
without a dick.

433
00:24:51,277 --> 00:24:53,598
♪ Life is very rough and tumble ♪

434
00:24:53,715 --> 00:24:55,570
Or a tongue.

435
00:25:03,813 --> 00:25:06,679
So Rhode Island
was just beginner's luck.

436
00:25:07,617 --> 00:25:11,773
Okay, uh, okay, "Summer's here
and ne'er retreats."

437
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,525
So "ne'er retreats," it's, uh,
it's set. "Summer is set."

438
00:25:16,793 --> 00:25:19,119
"Somer... Somerset. Somerset."

439
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:20,314
Somerset.

440
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:21,744
And the numbers could be
a street address.

441
00:25:21,769 --> 00:25:23,568
Right.

442
00:25:23,766 --> 00:25:27,365
"Quick as one, two, nine.
Middle is first, last is fine."

443
00:25:28,071 --> 00:25:32,143
219. So it's 219 something Somerset.

444
00:25:43,753 --> 00:25:46,687
Oh, come on.

445
00:25:55,465 --> 00:25:57,451
I think I can help.

446
00:26:01,854 --> 00:26:03,182
- Sorry, sir.
- Yes?

447
00:26:03,207 --> 00:26:05,140
We've had a security breach.

448
00:26:15,086 --> 00:26:16,688
Marina.

449
00:26:16,852 --> 00:26:18,997
Please.

450
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,426
I need asylum.

451
00:26:27,146 --> 00:26:29,162
Marina.

452
00:26:29,482 --> 00:26:32,623
What else can you tell me about this...

453
00:26:32,878 --> 00:26:34,654
situation?

454
00:26:43,996 --> 00:26:47,277
Well, for starters,
it's not a "situation."

455
00:26:47,467 --> 00:26:49,467
It's a raping, killing, omniscient god

456
00:26:49,492 --> 00:26:52,916
with a pretty specific type:
me and mine.

457
00:26:53,773 --> 00:26:55,406
What the fuck else do you need to know?

458
00:26:55,441 --> 00:26:58,275
I see you still don't
expend much on good manners.

459
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,577
What, this is a charm school now?

460
00:26:59,612 --> 00:27:02,269
No, but it is my school.

461
00:27:02,448 --> 00:27:04,214
Not a safe house.

462
00:27:04,484 --> 00:27:06,675
I was the best student
you ever had here.

463
00:27:06,819 --> 00:27:08,295
You said that.

464
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,765
I confused talent with character.

465
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:13,824
You need both
to be a true magician, Marina.

466
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,015
Kicking you out wasn't a choice.

467
00:27:16,162 --> 00:27:18,104
I couldn't have you
infecting my students then

468
00:27:18,129 --> 00:27:20,263
and I certainly won't now.

469
00:27:27,874 --> 00:27:30,260
You fucking prick.

470
00:27:32,345 --> 00:27:35,024
- Where am I supposed to go?
- You can keep your memories.

471
00:27:35,049 --> 00:27:38,315
I hope that whatever you've
learned here will help keep you safe.

472
00:27:38,461 --> 00:27:40,651
What I learned here will get me killed.

473
00:27:57,336 --> 00:28:00,286
Remember, pixies are tricky.

474
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,340
Keep all questions and answers
short and to the point.

475
00:28:03,376 --> 00:28:05,114
- You understand?
- Henry.

476
00:28:05,211 --> 00:28:07,981
- Ah, yes.
- Henry, you look awful.

477
00:28:08,147 --> 00:28:09,880
What happened to your eyes?
Are you blind?

478
00:28:09,916 --> 00:28:12,466
And your... your hair.
Henry, you look ancient.

479
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:14,218
Very nice of you to say so, dear.

480
00:28:14,253 --> 00:28:15,671
Oh, no wonder you sought me out.

481
00:28:15,696 --> 00:28:19,255
I mean, you've been
positively mauled by something.

482
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,728
Bigby, let me intro...

483
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:24,056
Mmm.

484
00:28:24,605 --> 00:28:26,408
Some things haven't changed.

485
00:28:26,433 --> 00:28:30,238
You still are the most wonderful kisser.

486
00:28:30,602 --> 00:28:31,969
Do you have time to go to bed with me?

487
00:28:32,004 --> 00:28:34,905
We are a bit on the clock, darling.

488
00:28:34,941 --> 00:28:36,786
And these are my students.

489
00:28:36,811 --> 00:28:38,370
They are in need of the Rhinemann Ultra.

490
00:28:38,395 --> 00:28:39,870
- Are they now?
- Oh, yes.

491
00:28:39,895 --> 00:28:41,979
Well, if the stuffed shirts
and ninny nay-sayers

492
00:28:42,014 --> 00:28:44,381
hadn't outlawed Battle Magic
38 years ago,

493
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:47,651
then they would have it,
which you well know, Henry.

494
00:28:50,623 --> 00:28:52,623
You look hungry.

495
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,427
So why was Battle Magic outlawed?

496
00:28:56,495 --> 00:29:00,505
Humans least attractive qualities.

497
00:29:00,933 --> 00:29:03,904
Panic and paranoia.

498
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:07,003
And there were several student
deaths that semester.

499
00:29:07,139 --> 00:29:09,650
Far fewer than the 1870s,

500
00:29:09,675 --> 00:29:11,971
or the 1920s, or the '60s.

501
00:29:12,378 --> 00:29:14,979
Another human failing, short memory.

502
00:29:17,783 --> 00:29:19,407
Hmm.

503
00:29:19,885 --> 00:29:22,782
You'd be the one casting. Good.

504
00:29:22,955 --> 00:29:25,649
It would burn anyone else to a crisp.

505
00:29:26,626 --> 00:29:29,988
I can feel your power. It's almost...

506
00:29:30,263 --> 00:29:33,799
it's almost god-like.

507
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,197
Did you fuck one of them?

508
00:29:35,222 --> 00:29:37,468
I mean, they are wonderful, aren't they?

509
00:29:37,503 --> 00:29:38,736
At least mine was.

510
00:29:38,771 --> 00:29:41,713
I glowed for weeks. No, literally.

511
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,641
I actually got mine
a little differently.

512
00:29:43,676 --> 00:29:46,443
Yes, and it's waning. Quite quickly.

513
00:29:46,566 --> 00:29:48,946
And so, Bigby, if you could
just please give us the spell.

514
00:29:48,981 --> 00:29:51,964
I don't give anything, Henry.
You of all people know that.

515
00:29:52,847 --> 00:29:54,549
So...

516
00:29:54,846 --> 00:29:57,142
well, convince me.

517
00:29:59,191 --> 00:30:02,293
Where the hell is the Burnt River?

518
00:30:04,597 --> 00:30:08,755
Apologies for last night, dear wife.

519
00:30:08,908 --> 00:30:11,699
None required, my lord.

520
00:30:11,937 --> 00:30:15,426
I will need to find some way
to blow off steam.

521
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:18,008
Somehow, someday. But in the meantime,

522
00:30:18,044 --> 00:30:21,856
I get to stroll
the wondrous memory fields

523
00:30:21,881 --> 00:30:24,215
of my agrarian childhood...

524
00:30:24,677 --> 00:30:27,099
sprinkling shit.

525
00:30:28,487 --> 00:30:30,661
Sprinkling... shit?

526
00:30:30,686 --> 00:30:33,424
Shoveling, mixing, drying, hauling.

527
00:30:33,459 --> 00:30:34,925
Sorry.

528
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,654
Sprinkling it on... what?

529
00:30:38,382 --> 00:30:40,582
Crops.

530
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,549
Oh.

531
00:30:42,868 --> 00:30:45,072
Fertilizer?

532
00:30:46,795 --> 00:30:49,740
Your farmers don't fertilize?

533
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:57,122
So it's the only thing we've
found that might stop The Beast.

534
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:59,161
I mean, it was amazing reading about how

535
00:30:59,186 --> 00:31:01,981
you used the Rhinemann at Gettysburg
to help win the war for the Union.

536
00:31:02,006 --> 00:31:04,676
Right. And it was you
who slipped it to Rupert Chatwin

537
00:31:04,694 --> 00:31:06,427
for the Battle of the Bulge.

538
00:31:06,463 --> 00:31:07,862
I mean, you changed history.

539
00:31:07,887 --> 00:31:10,464
Oh, I did, yes. Many times.

540
00:31:11,701 --> 00:31:15,308
Henry, is that juniper tree still there?

541
00:31:15,472 --> 00:31:17,830
You know, the one by the infirmary.

542
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:22,310
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, it has the softest grass.

543
00:31:22,345 --> 00:31:24,603
It feels delicious on your ass.

544
00:31:24,714 --> 00:31:26,447
I mean, we used to sneak out
at night and,

545
00:31:26,483 --> 00:31:29,680
- oh, for hours we would...
- Bigby, please.

546
00:31:29,705 --> 00:31:32,220
Are you telling me you don't
even remember that tree?

547
00:31:32,255 --> 00:31:34,956
Of course I do, darling. Of course.

548
00:31:34,991 --> 00:31:36,824
But it's private.

549
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,819
Well, not anymore.

550
00:31:38,844 --> 00:31:41,116
Plus, these two fuck like jackrabbits.

551
00:31:41,141 --> 00:31:42,804
I mean, you can just smell it.

552
00:31:42,905 --> 00:31:45,466
- Ahem.
- And it is delicious, darling.

553
00:31:45,502 --> 00:31:47,806
Bigby, we really are in a time crunch.

554
00:31:47,831 --> 00:31:49,017
- Mm-hmm.
- There's a lot at stake.

555
00:31:49,042 --> 00:31:51,906
Which I told you
would be the case someday, hmm.

556
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,650
Well, welcome to someday.

557
00:32:10,857 --> 00:32:14,501
No one but you can be
within 20 feet of the blast.

558
00:32:15,432 --> 00:32:18,479
It will kill anyone,
including your Beast.

559
00:32:18,718 --> 00:32:21,861
As strong as he is, you're stronger.

560
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,742
But not for long. Hmm?

561
00:32:27,884 --> 00:32:30,993
So, stop prattling and get to it.

562
00:32:34,972 --> 00:32:38,356
Boys, the shit.

563
00:32:39,043 --> 00:32:41,842
Um, Sire, I do not wish
to appear ungrateful...

564
00:32:41,867 --> 00:32:44,713
You're just going to have
to trust your king on this one.

565
00:32:53,827 --> 00:32:58,376
Come on, lads. Many a farm to grace...

566
00:32:58,603 --> 00:33:01,868
with... our royal dung.

567
00:33:03,674 --> 00:33:05,610
Yah! Come on!

568
00:33:18,995 --> 00:33:20,191
Ow.

569
00:33:21,175 --> 00:33:22,708
Shit.

570
00:33:22,853 --> 00:33:26,509
The time is 10:58 p.m.

571
00:33:28,592 --> 00:33:31,777
Alice, you're getting it, but...

572
00:33:31,871 --> 00:33:33,662
It's taking too long.

573
00:33:34,129 --> 00:33:36,165
I'm not as strong as I was.

574
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,761
By the time I'm fully powered up,

575
00:33:37,786 --> 00:33:39,527
The Beast will have eaten
all of our faces off.

576
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:42,938
You all are going to need
something strong to hit him with.

577
00:33:43,169 --> 00:33:45,207
Bigby isn't the only one

578
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:48,036
who tucked away a few secrets.

579
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:54,450
- Ah, ow!
- Sorry.

580
00:33:54,485 --> 00:33:56,958
The spell says it has to be tight.

581
00:33:57,555 --> 00:34:00,389
Do they have to be behind me?
I feel like I'm getting busted.

582
00:34:00,495 --> 00:34:03,125
You can't look at your hands
for 12 hours.

583
00:34:05,596 --> 00:34:07,063
Okay, whoa, what is that?

584
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:09,057
I can't pronounce the name.

585
00:34:09,333 --> 00:34:10,866
It's from China.

586
00:34:10,993 --> 00:34:13,025
It'll keep the blood circulating,

587
00:34:13,237 --> 00:34:16,595
but take away a lot of the discomfort.

588
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:19,548
Wait, that feels... ah!

589
00:34:22,467 --> 00:34:25,397
O... kay.

590
00:34:27,218 --> 00:34:30,980
I'm wondering if maybe you could
rub a little into my shoulder.

591
00:34:33,023 --> 00:34:35,285
Yeah, I got a cramp.

592
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,284
Which one?

593
00:34:37,628 --> 00:34:39,823
Both, actually.

594
00:35:14,665 --> 00:35:16,741
I feel guilty.

595
00:35:17,935 --> 00:35:19,768
Why?

596
00:35:19,939 --> 00:35:22,322
Letting you do all the work.

597
00:35:25,009 --> 00:35:26,814
I don't mind.

598
00:35:27,072 --> 00:35:31,187
Still, if there's anything
I can do for you, let me know.

599
00:35:31,448 --> 00:35:34,984
I don't think you're in
a position to do much.

600
00:35:35,853 --> 00:35:37,570
Try me.

601
00:35:38,989 --> 00:35:40,824
I might.

602
00:35:42,126 --> 00:35:43,622
After you graduate.

603
00:35:55,472 --> 00:35:58,323
- Jules.
- Q, hey.

604
00:35:58,464 --> 00:36:00,397
Hey.

605
00:36:02,676 --> 00:36:04,688
Hey, um...

606
00:36:04,876 --> 00:36:08,376
I-I got your message in my
bathroom mirror. It was freaky.

607
00:36:08,819 --> 00:36:12,454
Look, um, I'm not supposed to tell
you what I'm gonna tell you.

608
00:36:12,489 --> 00:36:14,256
Okay, fine. Don't.

609
00:36:14,291 --> 00:36:16,528
I just... I-I have to warn you.

610
00:36:17,928 --> 00:36:19,828
You could die if you don't
get clear of The Beast.

611
00:36:19,863 --> 00:36:21,563
You think I don't know
how dangerous he is?

612
00:36:21,598 --> 00:36:24,733
No, not him. Us.
We're going to kill him.

613
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:27,135
Do what you want with him
but not until I get Reynard.

614
00:36:27,171 --> 00:36:29,644
No, we can't wait.

615
00:36:29,973 --> 00:36:32,207
- You won't...
- No, Jules, we can't.

616
00:36:32,242 --> 00:36:34,509
I-I know that you're hurting. I just...

617
00:36:34,545 --> 00:36:37,312
I-I need you to see
that this is bigger than you.

618
00:36:37,347 --> 00:36:39,381
The Beast,
he's killing magic everywhere.

619
00:36:39,416 --> 00:36:41,052
And Reynard is killing
people everywhere.

620
00:36:41,077 --> 00:36:42,335
Do you think that that's less important?

621
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,488
No, I just think that what
you want here is revenge and...

622
00:36:45,513 --> 00:36:47,274
And you don't?

623
00:36:49,704 --> 00:36:53,005
Just don't be within
20 feet of The Beast

624
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,529
when we make our move, okay?

625
00:36:54,554 --> 00:36:58,493
Do it before I get Reynard,
you better not be within 20 miles of me.

626
00:37:01,371 --> 00:37:03,348
I came here to warn you
and you're threatening me.

627
00:37:08,378 --> 00:37:10,794
Look, I did what I had to do. I...

628
00:37:10,948 --> 00:37:13,013
make up your own mind.

629
00:37:13,783 --> 00:37:15,998
There's something.

630
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:20,121
About the castle.
He... he made some kind of joke.

631
00:37:20,157 --> 00:37:21,690
He put a curse on it.

632
00:37:21,725 --> 00:37:23,568
Anyone who assumes the throne.

633
00:37:23,727 --> 00:37:25,806
What kind of curse?

634
00:37:26,597 --> 00:37:28,376
He wouldn't say.

635
00:37:28,632 --> 00:37:30,173
But I'm pretty sure it's no joke.

636
00:37:30,267 --> 00:37:32,235
Okay, vague.

637
00:37:33,136 --> 00:37:35,057
Mildly helpful, I guess.

638
00:37:35,305 --> 00:37:37,291
It's all I got.

639
00:37:38,609 --> 00:37:40,283
Thank you.

640
00:37:42,446 --> 00:37:44,279
Sure.

641
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:46,248
This is...

642
00:37:48,819 --> 00:37:50,752
I know.

643
00:37:52,856 --> 00:37:55,790
Okay, I'll see you when I see you.

644
00:37:59,529 --> 00:38:01,102
See you.

645
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,453
Wow.

646
00:38:28,634 --> 00:38:30,196
I owe you for real.

647
00:38:41,057 --> 00:38:44,900
Good. Now this is going
to take just a few minutes

648
00:38:44,925 --> 00:38:46,391
to fully power up.

649
00:38:46,426 --> 00:38:48,505
You all are going to need
something strong

650
00:38:48,662 --> 00:38:50,435
to hold off The Beast.

651
00:38:50,664 --> 00:38:52,545
Step one...

652
00:38:52,799 --> 00:38:55,060
is for all of you

653
00:38:55,085 --> 00:38:59,298
to get very, very drunk.

654
00:38:59,606 --> 00:39:02,004
- Why?
- You'll see.

655
00:39:02,175 --> 00:39:04,316
Chug-a-lug.

656
00:39:04,738 --> 00:39:07,979
As you grow, your name will become
an important part of you.

657
00:39:08,093 --> 00:39:11,383
Even the shape of the letters
will connect with your will,

658
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,467
your unique abilities.

659
00:39:17,891 --> 00:39:20,985
Well, I can never get buried
in a Jewish cemetery.

660
00:39:21,194 --> 00:39:25,155
- Are you even Jewish?
- No, but options.

661
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:28,048
How much do I have to drink
so that I never have to hear

662
00:39:28,073 --> 00:39:30,201
- your voice again?
- Good.

663
00:39:30,226 --> 00:39:32,393
Now for the painful part.

664
00:39:32,439 --> 00:39:34,182
That wasn't the painful part?

665
00:39:34,207 --> 00:39:37,318
Oh, no. Professor Li?

666
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:01,428
This is a Cacodemon.

667
00:40:01,834 --> 00:40:03,701
- Jesus.
- They'll grow much bigger.

668
00:40:03,787 --> 00:40:07,238
Unleash these and believe me,
they'll keep The Beast plenty busy.

669
00:40:07,428 --> 00:40:11,397
Each of you will be given a special word
to command your Cacodemon to attack.

670
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,586
They're a one-shot weapon,

671
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:15,444
so pick your moment with care.

672
00:40:15,615 --> 00:40:18,403
What are you, uh, gonna do with it?

673
00:40:19,085 --> 00:40:21,853
Lift your shirt, Quentin,
and turn around.

674
00:40:21,888 --> 00:40:23,254
Oh.

675
00:40:23,396 --> 00:40:25,724
Those words never led to anything good.

676
00:40:25,892 --> 00:40:28,240
Well, almost never.

677
00:40:43,369 --> 00:40:45,336
Right, next.

678
00:40:50,217 --> 00:40:53,528
Sire, it's working.

679
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:55,372
Oh, great.

680
00:40:55,699 --> 00:40:58,700
- Mm, thank you.
- Thank you, my King.

681
00:40:59,259 --> 00:41:02,260
No, no. Thank the hell
that was my childhood.

682
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,286
Oh, well,

683
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:12,153
perfect timing, for once.

684
00:41:17,777 --> 00:41:21,484
Your High King has agricultural
tales to tell.

685
00:41:21,915 --> 00:41:24,780
I give you the reign of...

686
00:41:25,352 --> 00:41:26,970
King Shit.

687
00:41:31,256 --> 00:41:34,463
