Mmm.

00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,040

You still are the most
wonderful kisser.

533
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,740
Do you have time
to go to bed with me?

534
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:39,710
- We are a bit on the clock,
darling.

535
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,850
And these are my students.

536
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:42,980
They are in need
of the rhinemann ultra.

537
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,780
- [Chuckles] Are they now?
- Oh, yes.

538
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,750
- Well, if the stuffed shirts
and ninny nay-sayers

539
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:49,090
hadn't outlawed battle magic
38 years ago,

540
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:52,730
then they would have it,
which you well know, Henry.

541
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,800
You look hungry.

542
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,430
So why was battle magic
outlawed?

543
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,770
- Ugh. Humans least attractive

Panic and paranoia.

545
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:11,910
- And there were several student
deaths that semester.

546
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,080
- Far fewer than the 1870s,

547
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,080
or the 1920s, or the '60s.

Good.

to a crisp.

At least mine was.

No, literally.

558
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,480
- I actually got mine
a little differently.

559
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,150
- Yes, and it's waning.
Quite quickly.

560

And so, bigby, if you could
just please give us the spell.

561
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:57,860

Somehow, someday.
But in the meantime,

drying, hauling.

00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:43,270
Sprinkling it on... What?

575

who slipped it to Rupert chatwin

- This is...

703
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,430
- I know.

704
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:01,540
- Okay, I'll see you
when I see you.

705
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,280
- See you.

706
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,680
[Indistinct chatter]

707
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,840
- [Exhales sharply] Wow.

708
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,310
I owe you for real.

709
00:38:48,550 --> 00:38:52,390
- Good. Now this is going
to take just a few minutes

710
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:53,630
to fully power up.

711
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,830
You all are going to need
something strong

712
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:57,830
to hold off the beast.

713
00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:00,330
Step one...

714
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:02,630
Is for all of you

715
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,840
to get very, very drunk.

716
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,640
- Why?
- You'll see.

717
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,110
Chug-a-lug.
- [Groaning]

718
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:13,680
- As you grow,
your name will become

719
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,510
an important part of you.

720
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,680
Even the shape of the letters
will connect with your will,

721
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:20,620
your unique abilities.

722
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:25,420
- [Groaning]

723
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:28,660
- Well, I can never get buried
in a Jewish cemetery.

724
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:32,530
- Are you even Jewish?
- No, but options.

725
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:35,670
- How much do I have to drink
so that I never have to hear

726
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:37,670
your voice again?
- Good.

727
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,670
Now for the painful part.

728
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:41,570
- That wasn't the painful part?

729
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:44,910
- Oh, no.
Professor li?

730
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:04,760
- [Chittering]

731
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:08,830
- This is a cacodemon.

732
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,740
- Jesus.
- They'll grow much bigger.

733
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,440
Unleash these and believe me,

734
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,610
they'll keep the beast
plenty busy.

735
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:16,840
Each of you will be given
a special word

736
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,840
to command your cacodemon
to attack.

737
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,850
They're a one-shot weapon,

738
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:22,710
so pick your moment with care.

739
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,450
- What are you, uh,
gonna do with it?

740
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:28,950
- Lift your shirt, Quentin,
and turn around.

741
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,620
- Oh.

742
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,960
Those words never led
to anything good.

743
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,690
Well, almost never.

744
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,830
- [Chittering]
- [Screaming]

745
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:47,010
[Screaming]

746
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:51,440
[Panting]

747
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,580
- Right, next.

748
00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:00,890
- Sire, it's working.

749
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:03,620
- Oh, great.

750
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:06,620
Mm, thank you.
- Thank you, my king.

751
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,660
- No, no. Thank the hell
that was my childhood.

752
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,760
[Whooshing]

753
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:16,630
Oh, well, [Clears throat]

754
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,000
Perfect timing, for once.

755
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,470
Ahem.

756
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:29,010
Your high king has agricultural
tales to tell.

757
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:32,720
I give you the reign of...

758
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,950
King shit.

759
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,690
[Knocking]

760
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:42,830
