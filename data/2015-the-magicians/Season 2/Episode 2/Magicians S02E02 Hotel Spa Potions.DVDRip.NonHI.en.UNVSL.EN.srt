1
00:00:01,134 --> 00:00:02,796
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:06,529
<i>I hesitated with The Beast.
I should've... It's my fault.</i>

3
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:08,735
<i>- No, it's not.
- It's Julia's fault.</i>

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,376
You know how to deal with gods.

5
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:13,038
You know how
to... up their shit.

6
00:00:13,647 --> 00:00:14,647
Julia. No.

7
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:16,149
I want to make a deal.

8
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:18,742
No! Guys! She
was... She's not sane.

9
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:21,822
<i>One small consolation is the
bitch is with The Beast right now,</i>

10
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:23,824
and I can't really see
that going her way.

11
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:25,285
Word As Bond.

12
00:00:25,826 --> 00:00:28,295
I assume the extra
bits enchant the blade

13
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:31,560
to kill me instantly
in the event I break it.

14
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:33,123
You guys are from Brakebills?

15
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,863
Dude, Josh
Hoberman, class of '16.

16
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:37,802
Come with me if
you want to live.

17
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,132
<i>Yeah, Josh and Victoria bailed.</i>

18
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,607
<i>On one hand... them,</i>

19
00:00:41,675 --> 00:00:44,304
<i>on the other hand, you
can't really blame them.</i>

20
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:46,546
I'm Marina. JULIA:
<i>So you were...</i>

21
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:48,707
<i>Top bitch in New
York, for starters.</i>

22
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:50,181
<i>Welcome back to Brakebills.</i>

23
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:51,497
<i>Wait, you went here?</i>

24
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:53,945
<i>Kicked out three
months before graduation.</i>

25
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:55,546
<i>Let's go steal their shit.</i>

26
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:56,749
So, there's a bump.

27
00:00:56,957 --> 00:00:59,358
Bigger than marrying
a total stranger-ette?

28
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:02,555
<i>Once you get married, you won't
be able to be with anyone else.</i>

29
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:04,996
Literally. But when I go back...

30
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:07,925
I can never leave Fillory.

31
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:11,199
Please fix my hands.

32
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:14,105
<i>Let's see, how do I put this in
a way that you will understand?</i>

33
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:16,405
Ah. Go fuck yourself.

34
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:18,839
<i>According to the best
and only magic we have,</i>

35
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,279
<i>The Beast will kill
us. End of story.</i>

36
00:01:21,348 --> 00:01:24,147
Okay. A zillion bucks says The
Beast comes back any minute.

37
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:25,344
So what's the plan?

38
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:28,651
We lost the blade. So
we need a new something.

39
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:30,466
<i>Especially while Alice is
still...</i> ALICE: <i>Juiced up?</i>

40
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,856
Wait, this is something.

41
00:01:32,292 --> 00:01:34,625
It's a workbook on
spells. Serious ones.

42
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:36,820
But the actual
spells aren't here.

43
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,425
I know where we need to go.

44
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,123
Brakebills?

45
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:58,217
I don't get it.

46
00:01:58,285 --> 00:02:00,245
How come nobody in the
'hood is trying to kill us?

47
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,092
Okay, that's just weird.

48
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:11,963
You wanna stop and
figure it out, be my guest.

49
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:34,082
You're alive. What
a lovely surprise.

50
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:39,152
Okay, so...

51
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:44,364
The castle armory was
basically empty, except for this.

52
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,627
This is a Brakebills
student workbook.

53
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:50,330
I'm not blind,
Quentin. Technically.

54
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:51,732
From 1893.

55
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:54,570
So, I guess that means that a
Brakebills student was in Fillory,

56
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,610
uh, over 100 years ago.

57
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,917
And the only humans that had
access to the Armory were...

58
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:02,373
Own it, pumpkin. The Monarchy.

59
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,212
So, we're not the first
Brakebills students

60
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,686
to get into Fillory or
to assume the throne.

61
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,087
It's a great question
for history class,

62
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:12,744
but if The Beast gets to
the Wellspring right now

63
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:14,489
and sucks it bone dry,

64
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:17,526
magic dies in
Fillory. It dies there...

65
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:21,125
It dies here. On Earth.

66
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,194
My God.

67
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:26,604
So, the battle magic that
this student learned here,

68
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:28,233
he learned from a
professor named Bigby.

69
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:29,388
Have you heard of him? Her.

70
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,446
Well, there is a note in here.

71
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:38,341
There's a spell that seems strong
enough, called the Rhinemann Ultra.

72
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,478
Right. But the spell
isn't actually here.

73
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,079
Because why should
anything be easy?

74
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,386
Shit. Shit! Duck!

75
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:45,790
Who? PENNY: Everybody!

76
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,657
What the hell is that about?

77
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:54,796
Uh...

78
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:59,269
It's semi-not-related to any of
this, but I think I know a temp fix.

79
00:04:00,107 --> 00:04:01,107
All right.

80
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:03,709
I'll get back to you.

81
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,544
<i>Hey-ho</i>

82
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:13,543
<i>If love were all</i>

83
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,884
<i>I should be lonely</i>

84
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:23,058
<i>I believe</i>

85
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:25,622
<i>The more you love a girl</i>

86
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:29,328
<i>The more you give your trust</i>

87
00:04:29,836 --> 00:04:32,670
<i>The more you're bound to lose</i>

88
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:33,968
Okay, is that an actual song

89
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,033
or are you trying to get me to
stab a knife into my eardrums?

90
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,272
<i>Although</i>

91
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:41,076
Of course.

92
00:04:41,148 --> 00:04:43,674
<i>When shadows fall</i>

93
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,110
<i>I think if only</i>

94
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:51,586
<i>Somebody splendid
really needed me</i>

95
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,623
You mind? I'm working.

96
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,693
It's still too similar to the
first sigil that summoned him.

97
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,792
He'll know it's you. And a trap.

98
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,699
You're welcome to
have an actual idea.

99
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:06,899
Oh, no. I'd ruin
your primitive purity.

100
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:08,733
That's part of
what attracts him.

101
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,675
You're an absolute
savage, Julia.

102
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,804
Look, I know you're
basically stoned on sugar,

103
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,711
but if you could just
dial down the chipper.

104
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:18,252
All I do is accept
what you fight.

105
00:05:18,785 --> 00:05:19,785
Well...

106
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:23,685
Which is? Life is pointless.

107
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:25,757
The afterlife even more so.

108
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,952
Which is why we invent these
games to fill the void of existence.

109
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:32,932
Who diddled whom?
Who'll get revenge for it?

110
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,365
Who takes the throne?

111
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:38,064
Mmm. Yeah, well, that would
be me, actually, and my friends.

112
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:39,978
Oh, well, I doubt they're
your friends anymore.

113
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,274
And they won't be royals long.

114
00:05:44,144 --> 00:05:45,168
Why?

115
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:48,847
Oh, maybe you could use a bit
of help with the Binding Principle.

116
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:51,280
Did you put some kind
of curse on the castle?

117
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:52,918
Did I?

118
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:55,886
<i>It was so long ago.</i>

119
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,251
<i>I hardly remember.</i>

120
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:05,024
The Throne Room, sire.

121
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:11,995
Oh, God!

122
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,772
Can't be that hard
to find dead rats.

123
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,980
<i>Wait, wait, wait. Yes.</i>

124
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,517
<i>I believe I did work
up a little welcome.</i>

125
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:29,317
Yes, since Ember made it
impossible for me to retake the throne,

126
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,483
<i>and the Children of Earth
kept coming and coming,</i>

127
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,857
<i>drunk on self-love
and power-lust.</i>

128
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:38,190
<i>Yes, I thought of it
as a kind of royal test.</i>

129
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:40,195
<i>That no one ever passed.</i>

130
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:43,168
Sadly.

131
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,829
What kind of test?

132
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,706
Ah, that's something for each new
despot to puzzle out themselves.

133
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:53,679
Anyway, you're on the right
track. Now we just need the bait.

134
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:57,750
As soon as I'm finished
with this, I'm ready.

135
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:03,014
He knows you. A
bit too intimately.

136
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:06,926
No, I have the perfect,
fresh candidate.

137
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:10,658
She's young, beautiful, female
and a very powerful witch.

138
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,754
No.

139
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:14,366
Julia... Let's skip
the discussion.

140
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,232
You do as I say or this...

141
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:22,670
Does its job, per the bond.

142
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,969
Well, technically, the
Leo Blade cuts my throat

143
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:26,570
if I attempt to harm you,

144
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:28,911
your beloveds or
undermine your efforts.

145
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:31,246
And my dear, I assure you...

146
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:35,381
<i>I believe</i>

147
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,118
<i>That since my life began</i>

148
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,856
<i>The most I've had is just</i>

149
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:44,924
<i>A talent to amuse</i>

150
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:49,330
<i>Hey-ho</i>

151
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:53,565
<i>If love were all</i>

152
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,185
Uh...

153
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:16,991
Wait, the cottage
was here, right?

154
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,358
Hmm...

155
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,533
It's not invisible,
it's just not.

156
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,828
Aw, shit! Right.

157
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:29,141
End of semester prank to
ditch the first-year losers.

158
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:31,908
I should've remembered,
it was my idea.

159
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:33,979
Are you...

160
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,678
I hate all of you.
I hate all of you.

161
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:39,631
Could we just find
the cottage, please?

162
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:46,225
Mmm!

163
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:48,594
Promising.

164
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,197
To the first bottle of
Fillorian champagne.

165
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:55,428
Which I know technically
isn't champagne.

166
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:59,132
Except I'm renaming the Royal
Gardens "Champagne Nouveau" so...

167
00:09:01,608 --> 00:09:02,837
Ugh.

168
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:05,811
"Champagne No-No-No." Jesus!

169
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,346
That makes no sense.

170
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:09,781
I used the go-to
fermenting enchantment.

171
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:12,912
No fretting. We'll get
it right. Trial and error.

172
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:17,852
I'm your wife. I
want to be obedient.

173
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:20,858
Sit down.

174
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:23,226
Nobody wants to be obedient.

175
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:27,098
I do want to serve
you and Fillory.

176
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:29,835
But...

177
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:32,271
But?

178
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:39,979
Look, I'm okay being a king,
but I don't want to run a cult.

179
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:43,273
If anyone has the right
to speak up, it's you.

180
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:49,017
There hasn't been
a truly inspiring,

181
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,853
caring ruler since
Rupert Chatwin,

182
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:53,018
and that was so long ago,
most barely remember.

183
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,085
Look, I'm cleaning the place up.

184
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:57,255
I'm trying to get some
decent wine going.

185
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,162
What else is there?

186
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,228
The people are starving.

187
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:03,035
Seriously?

188
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,037
Oh. Okay. We should
probably get on that.

189
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,244
And I'm guessing magic
probably won't do the trick.

190
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:16,181
Magic is the problem.

191
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,544
Oh, boy.

192
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,298
Yep. We're alive. Deal.

193
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:44,970
Can you keep your shit
tight for a few more minutes?

194
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,443
Couple minutes is all I need.

195
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,848
Drink! Now!

196
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:54,316
You deserting,
chickenshit motherfucker!

197
00:10:54,387 --> 00:10:57,221
Wait! Wait, wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

198
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,593
No! No! Goddamn it!

199
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,322
Like Lando and Han. Right on.

200
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:09,301
Still got my legs.

201
00:11:11,738 --> 00:11:16,403
So, is it true what Josh is
saying? Fillory's real, right? Right?

202
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:20,438
Fillory is very real. Okay.

203
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:24,985
And this is going to be on
the syllabus next semester?

204
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:26,051
We shall see.

205
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:30,113
But for now, Quentin, Alice,
Penny and Margo need battle magic.

206
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,219
We're going to teach
battle magic now?

207
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,055
It was once a required course.

208
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:38,223
Till it was outlawed.
For good reason, I hear.

209
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:43,096
Yes, well, it was a
very messy situation.

210
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:44,967
At the time, I
thought it was right.

211
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,503
But the professor
who taught it disagreed.

212
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:49,000
Strongly.

213
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:52,944
She was fired and as she was
escorted off campus, she said that...

214
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,811
I'm sorry, Henry,
this is fascinating

215
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,010
but why are you telling me this?

216
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:59,279
The professor, Bigby,

217
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,045
hinted that she hid

218
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:05,285
all the battle magic spells
somewhere on campus.

219
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:08,992
"You'll need them
someday," she said.

220
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,730
"And me."

221
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,732
Again, why?

222
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:19,639
All the battle magic spells
are hidden in the library.

223
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,233
No one knows the
library better than you.

224
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:32,113
Look, I'm sorry, okay? We
both are. Seriously sorry.

225
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,478
So where is Victoria? Traveling.

226
00:12:35,021 --> 00:12:36,799
I don't even know if she's
on this planet anymore.

227
00:12:36,823 --> 00:12:37,847
Can't blame her.

228
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,527
Spit in it. What is it?

229
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,859
The hangover cure El and I
used when we got the shakes.

230
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,195
I amped it up with Nightshade
and a couple Ativans.

231
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:48,833
Might make you a little
woozy but it could do the trick.

232
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,007
Temporarily. So
keep a stash on you.

233
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:59,002
It is good to see
you guys, though.

234
00:12:59,078 --> 00:13:01,047
Hey, fuck off. Okay.

235
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,688
Oh!

236
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:15,827
This one...

237
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:20,728
Is sheer, hellcat perfection.

238
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:30,670
I don't give a shit
about getting him.

239
00:13:30,743 --> 00:13:33,144
You should. Look, I
didn't summon him.

240
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:35,310
I didn't get raped by him.

241
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:36,474
I have no skin in this

242
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,279
except that I
wanna kick your ass

243
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:39,410
and kill him.

244
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,919
<i>Fate may often treat me meanly</i>

245
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:46,220
<i>But I keenly pursue</i>

246
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,890
<i>A little mirage in the blue</i>

247
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,098
Did you scrape him
off the cabaret floor?

248
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:56,767
Reynard is targeting
Hedges. Right,

249
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,766
so the answer is to
hire Michael Bublé

250
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,636
to kidnap me and then
use me as your bait.

251
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:02,765
If I'm wrong, raise your hand.

252
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:04,242
Look, you're right.

253
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,870
It was wrong grabbing
you the way that we did.

254
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:09,187
But sooner or later
he was gonna find you.

255
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:12,111
We need someone... Else, Julia.

256
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,218
Or we have a problem.

257
00:14:15,088 --> 00:14:16,288
Do you want a problem with me?

258
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:20,182
Forget it. Great.

259
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:28,064
I told you untying
her was a mistake.

260
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:32,201
Ow!

261
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:35,736
What? It's starting
to burn a little.

262
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:39,770
Take it off. No,
I can't. I need it.

263
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:43,244
The more it burns,
the less time we have.

264
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,052
If it hurts then...

265
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:50,147
Not everything
that hurts is bad.

266
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,093
I hate that all
of this is on you.

267
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:00,511
You'd tell me if there
was something I could do?

268
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,259
To shift the weight off?

269
00:15:06,973 --> 00:15:07,973
Yeah, I'd tell you.

270
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:32,374
<i>Look, she's a bitch on three
wheels, probably batshit crazy,</i>

271
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:35,027
<i>but she's not wrong.
Did you find it?</i>

272
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,967
I did. And?

273
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,472
Look, I know we made a pact,

274
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,736
I stick to my coast,
you stick to yours,

275
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,971
but this might take all
the top hedge witches

276
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:46,637
to coven up and
take this asshole out.

277
00:15:47,513 --> 00:15:49,175
Your coast or mine?

278
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:50,944
I'm already on my way.

279
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:59,117
So, if I'm understanding this,

280
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:01,388
things here grow magically.

281
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:03,059
Until recently, yes.

282
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:05,327
Everything always
took care of itself.

283
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:08,098
We used to grow all the
nuts in the southern region.

284
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:09,601
Until The Beast
drained the magic.

285
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:13,038
Now what's required
is actual farm work,

286
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:16,540
which no one in
Fillory knows how to do.

287
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,338
Uh...

288
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:24,941
I think I'm getting one
of those migraines where

289
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:26,280
everything gets all bendy.

290
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:29,014
Please, God, let me pass out.

291
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:33,349
No? All right.

292
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:35,961
Fen.

293
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:41,099
I have a secret.

294
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,027
It's fairly difficult
for me to confess.

295
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:46,631
And it brings me nothing but
waves of aching nausea, but...

296
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,274
I grew up on a farm.

297
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:54,475
That's your secret?

298
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:56,140
I've spent years
blocking it all out.

299
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,043
The smell of wet hay.

300
00:17:00,453 --> 00:17:02,888
That feel of an udder.

301
00:17:03,723 --> 00:17:07,626
- The taste of fresh...
- Goat milk.

302
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:12,590
And the worst humans in
the known universe, my family.

303
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,793
It's coming back,
and if it all comes back

304
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,580
I'm pretty sure I'll
know exactly what to do.

305
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:21,768
That's wonderful! On
a planet with no Zoloft.

306
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:23,937
Now you sound like my King.

307
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:32,350
And, so if I just needed
one little thing from you to,

308
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,717
to ease my agony...

309
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:36,620
Anything.

310
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:38,447
There's my girl.

311
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:46,457
Professor Bigby was
brilliant. Impatient. Stubborn.

312
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,859
And mercurial.

313
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:49,835
And a 500-year-old pixie,

314
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,838
who more-or-less saw humans
as children to be toyed with.

315
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:54,616
If she's as good as her word,

316
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,351
and one thing she
certainly wasn't was a liar,

317
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,935
then her book of battle
magic will be found here.

318
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,411
In this room. Why?

319
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:05,617
She told me. "The battle magic will
be where the knowledge always is.

320
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:08,985
"The day you need it, I
promise, it will be your last hope."

321
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,219
Er, those are her exact
words? "Last hope"?

322
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:14,316
Yes.

323
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:17,367
Well, that's the name of one of the
more powerful texts on battle magic.

324
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,058
<i>The Last Hope Options.</i>

325
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,100
Yes! Of course.

326
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:22,897
Pixies love puzzles and riddles.

327
00:18:22,969 --> 00:18:24,801
Especially those that
make humans look stupid.

328
00:18:25,171 --> 00:18:27,316
She gave me the title of the
book that we're searching for,

329
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,366
but I'm afraid that it
will be very hard to find.

330
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:31,209
Let's get to it.

331
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:34,703
<i>Rhinemann.</i>

332
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:43,748
<i>The Rhinemann Exchange.</i>
A spy novel by Robert Ludlum.

333
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:45,516
What's next?

334
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:49,218
"Last Hope Options"
is an anagram for?

335
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,066
"Pane Hotspot Silo"?

336
00:18:58,237 --> 00:18:59,237
All right.

337
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,550
Let's try assigning a different
number structure to the letters.

338
00:19:01,574 --> 00:19:03,440
For instance, "A"
is 11, "B" is 22,

339
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:04,909
"C" is 44 and so on.

340
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:06,068
Okay.

341
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:09,806
"Tat Loosens Hippo".

342
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:12,909
"Opine Path Stools".

343
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,854
Pixie puzzles?

344
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:25,997
Ah...

345
00:19:43,716 --> 00:19:44,843
Penny.

346
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:46,395
What's... What's
happened to your hands?

347
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:47,443
What hasn't?

348
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,121
Well, tell me. Why?

349
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:53,951
Maybe I can help.

350
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:56,222
<i>Nada.</i>

351
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,093
Professor?

352
00:19:58,164 --> 00:19:59,164
I can safely say that

353
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:01,826
none of the number codes we
came up with led to anything.

354
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,595
We found about 300
anagram phrases.

355
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:06,366
Anything promising?

356
00:20:06,739 --> 00:20:10,904
Uh... Well, uh,
"hospital nose top"

357
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:13,813
mean anything? What about,

358
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,377
"latte shop poison"? No?

359
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:19,679
That's surprising.

360
00:20:20,686 --> 00:20:22,279
Uh... Oh, this one's good.

361
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,755
This one's my favorite
because it's absurd.

362
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:27,424
"Hotel Spa Potions."

363
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:31,889
Wait. That's a book. In here.

364
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:44,809
Yes!

365
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,841
<i>Last Hope Options.</i> DEAN: Ah.

366
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:54,614
A chapter's been ripped out.

367
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:57,288
Wait, there's a note.

368
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:58,816
"Hello, Henry.

369
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:01,422
"If you're reading
this, I was right

370
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:03,292
"and everyone at
Brakebills was wrong.

371
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:04,820
"How delightful.

372
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:09,601
"It also means I'll see
you quick as 1, 2, 9,

373
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:12,062
"where middle
leads and last is fine.

374
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,631
"Summer's here
and ne'er retreats,

375
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:17,801
"a pretty island
made of streets."

376
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,776
Another riddle. Awesome.

377
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,677
Oh, well, if it's, like,
where to find her,

378
00:21:23,749 --> 00:21:25,445
"island made of
streets" is Rhode Island.

379
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,812
What? Duh.

380
00:21:36,328 --> 00:21:38,729
Sorry, could you spell
your last name again?

381
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:40,489
I would but...

382
00:21:42,835 --> 00:21:43,835
You're asleep.

383
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:12,226
You said "anything."

384
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:14,529
But this is... This is...

385
00:22:19,238 --> 00:22:21,139
Am I not enough for you?

386
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:24,499
You're great.

387
00:22:25,744 --> 00:22:28,714
For who you are. It's just...

388
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,477
I already told you, my
life was different before.

389
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:34,716
Yeah, and I'll help
you make a new life.

390
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:39,289
Well, this is new.

391
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,593
And right inside
the lines of marriage.

392
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:44,194
We just do what we do in bed

393
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,656
and they do what they do.

394
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,166
I only picked people
already doing each other.

395
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:51,295
And we get to watch.

396
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:57,252
You guys are all
cool with this, right?

397
00:22:57,276 --> 00:22:58,403
Mmm-hmm.

398
00:22:58,477 --> 00:22:59,501
See?

399
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,340
You're their King.

400
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:04,977
They'll do as you
wish, no matter how...

401
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,848
Fun? Debased.

402
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:08,353
Debased?

403
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:12,290
Honey-love, I've been
doing this shit since I was 12.

404
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,089
Except on a computer.

405
00:23:15,461 --> 00:23:16,759
I don't know what that means.

406
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,927
But, if it's what you desire...

407
00:23:26,272 --> 00:23:28,298
All right, goodnight, everyone.

408
00:23:28,374 --> 00:23:31,173
Thanks. You all look
really good naked.

409
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,243
Thank you, sire.

410
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:46,319
Well, I guess life is about
new experiences and...

411
00:23:46,392 --> 00:23:47,917
I've never been
pussy-whipped, so.

412
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:55,867
You're doomed.

413
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:01,035
Which I might find amusing,
except it's likely to get me killed.

414
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:03,598
And for what?

415
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:07,346
Because no matter what,
I'm going to hold onto my...

416
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:08,733
If you say
"humanity" you'll learn

417
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,579
I can vomit nonstop
for two hours.

418
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:18,013
You know, I'm about to
make an enemy of a god

419
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,355
who I have no quarrel with.

420
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,184
And without decent bait,

421
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:24,526
you're literally asking
me to do it blindfolded,

422
00:24:24,596 --> 00:24:26,258
shackled and hopping on one leg.

423
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:32,360
If I took just a
smidgen of your Shade,

424
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:35,374
not only would your
trauma drop away,

425
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:38,968
you'd have no issue
with using Marina.

426
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:42,106
You'd be free of
these useless feelings

427
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:44,241
and this idiotic moral quagmire.

428
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,448
Come near me, and
the knife won't kill you.

429
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,119
'Cause you can still
live without a dick.

430
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,256
<i>Life is very rough and tumble...</i>

431
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,524
Or a tongue.

432
00:25:07,573 --> 00:25:09,701
So, Rhode Island was
just beginner's luck.

433
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:15,346
Okay, uh, okay. "Summer's
here and ne'er retreats."

434
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:19,715
So "ne'er retreats."
It's set. Summer is set.

435
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,647
Summer... Summer set. Somerset.

436
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,548
"Somerset." And the numbers
could be a street address?

437
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:26,648
Right.

438
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:30,586
"Quick as 1, 2, 9.
Middle is first, last is fine."

439
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:33,463
219.

440
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,433
So, it's 219-something Somerset.

441
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:49,877
Come on!

442
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,248
I think I can help.

443
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:06,831
Sorry, sir? Yes?

444
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,179
But we've had a security breach.

445
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:21,276
Marina. Please.

446
00:26:24,283 --> 00:26:25,444
I need asylum.

447
00:26:32,357 --> 00:26:36,954
Marina, what else can
you tell me about this...

448
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:38,996
Situation?

449
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:51,677
Well, for starters,
it's not a "situation."

450
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:56,041
It's a raping, killing, omniscient
god with a pretty specific type.

451
00:26:56,582 --> 00:26:57,606
Me and mine.

452
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:00,576
What the fuck else
do you need to know?

453
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:03,383
I see you still don't expend
much on good manners.

454
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,735
What, this is a
charm school now?

455
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:08,420
No, but it is my school.
Not a safe house.

456
00:27:09,595 --> 00:27:11,496
I was the best student
you ever had here.

457
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:15,499
You said that. I confused
talent with character.

458
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:18,631
You need both to be a
true Magician, Marina.

459
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:20,572
Kicking you out wasn't a choice.

460
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:23,142
I couldn't have you
infecting my students then,

461
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,301
and I certainly won't now.

462
00:27:33,218 --> 00:27:34,379
You fucking prick.

463
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:38,786
Where am I supposed to go?

464
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:40,052
You can keep your memories.

465
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:43,118
I hope that whatever you've
learned here will help keep you safe.

466
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:45,282
What I learned here
will get me killed.

467
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:04,913
Remember, pixies are tricky.

468
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:08,246
Keep all questions and
answers short, and to the point.

469
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,618
You understand? BIGBY: Henry!

470
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:12,656
Ah, yes. Henry! You look awful!

471
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:15,525
What's happened to your
eyes? Are you blind? And your...

472
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:17,490
Your hair! Henry,
you look ancient!

473
00:28:17,563 --> 00:28:19,293
Very nice of you
to say so, dear.

474
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,644
Oh, no wonder you sought me out.

475
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:24,227
I mean, you've been
positively mauled by something.

476
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:25,635
Bigby, let me introduce...

477
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:27,700
Mmm...

478
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,476
Some things haven't changed.

479
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,741
You still are the
most wonderful kisser.

480
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,192
Do you have time
to go to bed with me?

481
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:41,347
We are a bit on the clock,
darling. And these are my students.

482
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:43,431
They are in need of
the Rhinemann Ultra.

483
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:44,855
Are they now? Oh, yes.

484
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:46,892
Well, if the stuffed shirts
and ninny naysayers

485
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:49,588
hadn't outlawed battle
magic 38 years ago,

486
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:52,290
then they would have it.
Which you well know, Henry.

487
00:28:55,834 --> 00:28:57,097
You look hungry.

488
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:01,506
So, why was battle
magic outlawed?

489
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:04,802
Ugh. Humans' least
attractive qualities.

490
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:08,703
Panic and paranoia.

491
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:12,284
And there were several
student deaths that semester.

492
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:14,684
Far fewer than the 1870s,

493
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,915
or the 1920s, or the '60s.

494
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:19,958
Another human
failing. Short memory.

495
00:29:20,025 --> 00:29:21,118
Mmm.

496
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,123
Hmm.

497
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:27,532
You'd be the one casting? Good.

498
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:29,895
It'd burn anyone
else to a crisp.

499
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:34,571
I can feel your
power. It's almost...

500
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:40,178
It's almost godlike. Did
you fuck one of them?

501
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:42,271
I mean, they are
wonderful, aren't they?

502
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:46,648
Or at least mine was. I
glowed for weeks. No, literally.

503
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:48,346
I actually got mine
a little differently.

504
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:51,356
Yes, and it's
waning. Quite quickly.

505
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:53,851
So, Bigby, if you could
just please give us the spell.

506
00:29:53,925 --> 00:29:56,861
I don't give anything, Henry.
You of all people know that.

507
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:01,161
So, well, convince me.

508
00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:06,769
Where the hell is
the burned river?

509
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:13,303
Apologies for last
night, dear wife.

510
00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:15,742
None required, My Lord.

511
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:20,577
I will need to find some
way to blow off steam.

512
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,850
Somehow, someday, but
in the meantime, I get to

513
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:28,652
stroll the wondrous memory
fields of my agrarian childhood.

514
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:31,389
Sprinkling shit.

515
00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:35,592
"Sprinkling shit"?

516
00:30:35,734 --> 00:30:38,363
Shoveling, mixing,
drying, hauling.

517
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:42,497
Sorry, sprinkling it on what?

518
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:44,999
Crops.

519
00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:46,837
Oh...

520
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:49,146
Fertilizer?

521
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:54,648
Your farmers don't fertilize?

522
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:02,150
So, it's the only thing we've
found that might stop The Beast.

523
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:03,957
I mean, it was
amazing reading about

524
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:05,589
how you used the
Rhinemann at Gettysburg

525
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:07,208
to help win the war for the Union.
- Right.

526
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:09,701
And it was you who
slipped it to Rupert Chatwin

527
00:31:09,768 --> 00:31:10,888
for the Battle of the Bulge.

528
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,902
I mean, you changed history.

529
00:31:13,004 --> 00:31:15,064
I did. Yes. Many times.

530
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:20,403
Henry, is that
juniper tree still there?

531
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:22,573
You know, the one
by the infirmary?

532
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:27,312
Oh, yes. Oh! It has
the softest grass.

533
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:29,719
It feels delicious on your ass.

534
00:31:29,788 --> 00:31:33,122
I mean, we used to sneak out at
night and, oh, for hours, we would...

535
00:31:33,191 --> 00:31:34,682
Bigby. Please.

536
00:31:34,793 --> 00:31:37,319
Are you telling me you don't
even remember that tree?

537
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:41,128
Of course I do, darling.
Of course. But it's private.

538
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:43,835
Well, not anymore!

539
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,098
Plus, these two
fuck like jackrabbits!

540
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:48,731
I mean, you can just smell it.

541
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:50,400
And it is delicious, darling.

542
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:53,240
Bigby, we really are in a
time crunch. Mmm-hmm.

543
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:54,370
There's a lot at stake.

544
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:57,041
Which I told you would be
the case someday. Hmm?

545
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:59,308
Well, welcome to someday.

546
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:19,429
No one but you can be
within 20 feet of the blast.

547
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:22,807
It will kill anyone,
including your Beast.

548
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:26,945
As strong as he
is, you're stronger.

549
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:35,543
But not for long. Hmm? So,
stop prattling and get to it!

550
00:32:40,826 --> 00:32:42,988
Boys? The shit.

551
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:47,492
Um, sire, I do not wish
to appear ungrateful...

552
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:49,806
You're just going to have
to trust your King on this one.

553
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:03,871
Come on, lads,
many a farm to grace...

554
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:07,112
With our royal dung!

555
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:10,488
Hyah!

556
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:28,062
Shit!

557
00:33:28,607 --> 00:33:32,009
<i>The time is 10:58 p.m.</i>

558
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:37,445
Alice, you're getting it. But...

559
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:41,212
It's taking too long. I'm
not as strong as I was.

560
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,464
By the time I'm
fully powered up,

561
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:45,457
The Beast will have
eaten all of our faces off.

562
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:48,460
You all are going to need
something strong to hit him with.

563
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:53,188
Bigby isn't the only one who
tucked away a few secrets.

564
00:33:58,236 --> 00:33:59,431
Ow!

565
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:02,269
Sorry, spell says
it has to be tight.

566
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:05,976
Do they have to be behind
me? I feel like I'm getting busted.

567
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,779
You can't look at your
hands for 12 hours.

568
00:34:11,483 --> 00:34:13,975
Okay, what is that? I
can't pronounce the name.

569
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,213
It's from China.

570
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,917
It'll keep the blood circulating

571
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,653
but take away a
lot of the discomfort.

572
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:24,519
Wait, that feels... Ahh!

573
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:30,502
Okay.

574
00:34:33,138 --> 00:34:36,131
I'm wondering if maybe you
could rub a little into my shoulder.

575
00:34:38,877 --> 00:34:39,877
Yeah, I got a cramp.

576
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,904
Which one?

577
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:44,972
Both, actually.

578
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:21,752
I feel guilty.

579
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:24,912
Why?

580
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:27,119
Letting you do all the work.

581
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:31,962
I don't mind.

582
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,131
Still.

583
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,559
If there's anything I can
do for you, let me know.

584
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:39,928
I don't think you're in
a position to do much.

585
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:42,730
Try me.

586
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:45,976
I might.

587
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,342
After you graduate.

588
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:02,383
Jules!

589
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:04,624
Q. Hey. Hey.

590
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:10,091
Hey, um...

591
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:13,001
I got your message
in my bathroom mirror.

592
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:14,095
So freaky.

593
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:18,406
Look, I'm not supposed to
tell you what I'm gonna tell you.

594
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:20,035
Okay, fine. Don't.

595
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:22,342
It's just... I have
to warn you. Uh...

596
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:25,675
You could die if you don't
get clear of The Beast.

597
00:36:25,717 --> 00:36:27,194
You think I don't know
how dangerous he is?

598
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:29,244
No. Not him. Us.

599
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,413
We're going to kill him.

600
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:32,833
Yeah, do what you want with
him, but not until I get Reynard.

601
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,155
No, we can't wait.

602
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,854
You won't. No! Jules, we can't.

603
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:40,592
I know that you're
hurting. I just, I...

604
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:42,839
I need you to see that
this is bigger than you.

605
00:36:42,901 --> 00:36:44,995
The Beast, he is killing
magic everywhere.

606
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,766
And Reynard is killing
people everywhere.

607
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:48,149
You think that
that's less important?

608
00:36:48,173 --> 00:36:51,109
No, I just think that what you
want here is revenge and...

609
00:36:51,176 --> 00:36:52,235
And you don't?

610
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:58,775
Just don't be within
20 feet of The Beast

611
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:00,250
when we make our move, okay?

612
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:01,398
Do it before I get Reynard,

613
00:37:01,453 --> 00:37:03,649
you better not be
within 20 miles of me.

614
00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:09,220
I came here to warn you,
and you're threatening me.

615
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:15,858
Look, I did what I had to do.

616
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:17,493
Just make up your own mind.

617
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:20,437
There's something.

618
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,303
About the castle.

619
00:37:24,943 --> 00:37:26,903
He made some kind of a
joke. He put a curse on it.

620
00:37:27,512 --> 00:37:29,037
Anyone who assumes the throne.

621
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:30,573
What kind of curse?

622
00:37:32,584 --> 00:37:33,584
He wouldn't say.

623
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:35,910
But I'm pretty
sure it's no joke.

624
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:37,148
Okay, vague.

625
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:40,616
Mildly helpful. I guess.

626
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:41,859
It's all I got.

627
00:37:44,529 --> 00:37:45,553
Thank you.

628
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:49,390
Sure.

629
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:51,441
This is...

630
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:55,797
I know.

631
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,469
Okay, I'll see you
when I see you.

632
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:06,483
See you.

633
00:38:33,011 --> 00:38:34,570
Wow.

634
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:37,507
I owe you for real.

635
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,860
Good.

636
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:53,392
Alice is going to take just a
few minutes to fully power up.

637
00:38:54,232 --> 00:38:57,600
You all are going to need
something strong to hold off The Beast.

638
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,193
Step one

639
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:01,666
is for all of you

640
00:39:03,141 --> 00:39:05,872
to get very, very drunk.

641
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:10,471
Why? You'll see. Chug-a-lug.

642
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:15,679
As you grow, your name will
become an important part of you.

643
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:18,985
Even the shape of the letters
will connect with your will,

644
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:20,855
your unique abilities.

645
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:28,429
Well, I can never get
buried in a Jewish cemetery.

646
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:30,692
Are you even Jewish?

647
00:39:30,768 --> 00:39:32,737
No. Options.

648
00:39:32,804 --> 00:39:34,670
How much do I
have to drink so that

649
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:36,833
I never have to hear
your voice again?

650
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:39,807
Good. Now, for the painful part.

651
00:39:40,278 --> 00:39:42,474
That wasn't the
painful part? Oh, no.

652
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:44,572
Professor Li?

653
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:08,738
This is a cacodemon.

654
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,440
Jesus. DEAN: They'll
grow much bigger.

655
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:14,673
Unleash these and, believe me,
they'll keep The Beast plenty busy.

656
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:16,773
Each of you will be
given a special word

657
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:18,442
to command your
cacodemon to attack.

658
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:21,216
They are a one-shot weapon.

659
00:40:21,286 --> 00:40:22,914
So, pick your moment with care.

660
00:40:23,288 --> 00:40:25,723
What are you, uh,
gonna do with it?

661
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:29,360
Lift your shirt, Quentin,
and turn around.

662
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:30,618
Oh!

663
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:33,392
Those words never
led to anything good.

664
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:35,365
Well, almost never.

665
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,682
Right. Next.

666
00:40:57,922 --> 00:41:00,892
Sire, it's working.

667
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,487
Oh, great.

668
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:05,396
Mmm, thank you.
Thank you, My King.

669
00:41:06,998 --> 00:41:09,729
No, no, thank the hell
that was my childhood.

670
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,131
Oh, well.

671
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:18,801
Perfect timing. For once.

672
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:28,716
Your High King has
agricultural tales to tell.

673
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:31,954
I give you the reign of...

674
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:33,816
King Shit.

675
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:41,466
I figured you'd pretty much
be dead without me. So...

676
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:48,151
<i>Is it an earthquake?</i>

677
00:41:49,474 --> 00:41:51,204
<i>Or simply a shock?</i>

678
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,038
<i>Is it the good turtle soup</i>

679
00:41:55,947 --> 00:41:57,779
<i>Or merely the mock?</i>

680
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,209
Jesus Christ.

681
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:03,049
<i>Is it a cocktail?</i>

682
00:42:03,121 --> 00:42:05,454
<i>This feeling of joy?</i>

683
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06,821
He has to stop.

684
00:42:07,425 --> 00:42:09,792
<i>Or is what I feel</i>

685
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:14,561
<i>The real McCoy?</i>

686
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:17,500
Ah, don't make me wait, ladies.

687
00:42:17,568 --> 00:42:19,764
Are we three
going to kill a god?

688
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:22,231
Yeah, for starters. Good one.

689
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:24,502
<i>Is it Granada I see?</i>

690
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:27,977
<i>Or only Asbury Park?</i>

691
00:42:29,614 --> 00:42:31,810
<i>Is it a fancy</i>

692
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,951
<i>You lose like a glove</i>

693
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:39,555
<i>Or is it at long</i>

694
00:42:39,624 --> 00:42:42,958
<i>Last love?</i>
