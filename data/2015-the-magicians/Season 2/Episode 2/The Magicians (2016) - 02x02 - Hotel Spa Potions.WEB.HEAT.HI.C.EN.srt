I'm not blind, Quentin, technically.

54
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:54,272
From 1893, so I guess that
means that a Brakebills student

55
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:57,476
was in Fillory over a hundred years ago.

56
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,978

access to the armory were...

57

Own it, pumpkin. The Monarchy.

58
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,151

but if The Beast gets to
the Wellspring right now

62
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:17,295

- Have you heard of him?
- Her.

69
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:34,900
Well, there is a note in here.

70
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,515

00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:51,019
Well, if the stuffed shirts
and ninny nay-sayers

533
00:28:51,054 --> 00:28:53,421
hadn't outlawed Battle Magic
38 years ago,

534
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:56,691
then they would have it,
which you well know, Henry.

535
00:28:59,663 --> 00:29:01,663
You look hungry.

536
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,467
So why was Battle Magic outlawed?

537
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:09,545
[sighs] Humans least
attractive qualities.

538
00:29:09,973 --> 00:29:12,944
Panic and paranoia.

539
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:16,043
And there were several student
deaths that semester.

540
00:29:16,179 --> 00:29:18,690
Far fewer than the 1870s,

541
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:21,011
or the 1920s, or the '60s.

542
00:29:21,418 --> 00:29:24,019
Another human failing, short memory.

543
00:29:26,823 --> 00:29:28,447
Hmm.

544
00:29:28,925 --> 00:29:31,822
You'd be the one casting. Good.

545
00:29:31,995 --> 00:29:34,689
It would burn anyone else to a crisp.

546
00:29:35,666 --> 00:29:39,028
I can feel your power. It's almost...

547
00:29:39,303 --> 00:29:42,839
[chuckles]
it's almost god-like.

548
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,237
Did you fuck one of them?

549
00:29:44,262 --> 00:29:46,508
I mean, they are wonderful, aren't they?

550
00:29:46,543 --> 00:29:47,776
At least mine was.

551
00:29:47,811 --> 00:29:50,753
I glowed for weeks. No, literally.

552
00:29:50,778 --> 00:29:52,681
I actually got mine
a little differently.

553
00:29:52,716 --> 00:29:55,483
Yes, and it's waning. Quite quickly.

554
00:29:55,606 --> 00:29:57,986
And so, Bigby, if you could
just please give us the spell.

555
00:29:58,021 --> 00:30:01,004
I don't give anything, Henry.
You of all people know that.

556
00:30:01,887 --> 00:30:03,589
So...

557
00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:06,182

Apologies for last night, dear wife.

560
00:30:17,948 --> 00:30:20,739
None required, my lord.

561
00:30:20,977 --> 00:30:24,466
I will need to find some way
to blow off steam.

562
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,048
Somehow, someday. But in the meantime,

563
00:30:27,084 --> 00:30:30,896
I get to stroll
the wondrous memory fields

564
00:30:30,921 --> 00:30:33,255
of my agrarian childhood...

565
00:30:33,717 --> 00:30:36,139
sprinkling shit.

566
00:30:37,527 --> 00:30:39,701
Sprinkling... shit?

567
00:30:39,726 --> 00:30:42,464
Shoveling, mixing, drying, hauling.

568
00:30:42,499 --> 00:30:43,965
Sorry.

569
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,694
Sprinkling it on... what?

570
00:30:47,422 --> 00:30:49,622
Crops.

571
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,589
Oh.

572
00:30:51,908 --> 00:30:54,112
Fertilizer?

573
00:30:55,835 --> 00:30:58,780
Your farmers don't fertilize?

574
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:06,162
So it's the only thing we've
found that might stop The Beast.

575
00:31:06,187 --> 00:31:08,201
I mean, it was amazing reading about how

576
00:31:08,226 --> 00:31:11,021
you used the Rhinemann at Gettysburg
to help win the war for the Union.

577
00:31:11,046 --> 00:31:13,716
Right. And it was you
who slipped it to Rupert Chatwin

578
00:31:13,734 --> 00:31:15,467
for the Battle of the Bulge.

579
00:31:15,503 --> 00:31:16,902
I mean, you changed history.

580
00:31:16,927 --> 00:31:19,504
Oh, I did, yes. Many times.

581
00:31:20,741 --> 00:31:24,348
Henry, is that juniper tree still there?

582
00:31:24,512 --> 00:31:26,870
You know, the one by the infirmary.

583
00:31:27,081 --> 00:31:31,350
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, it has the softest grass.

584
00:31:31,385 --> 00:31:33,643
It feels delicious on your ass.

585
00:31:33,754 --> 00:31:35,487
I mean, we used to sneak out
at night and,

586
00:31:35,523 --> 00:31:38,720
- oh, for hours we would...
- Bigby, please.

587
00:31:38,745 --> 00:31:41,260
Are you telling me you don't
even remember that tree?

588
00:31:41,295 --> 00:31:43,996
Of course I do, darling. Of course.

589
00:31:44,031 --> 00:31:45,864
- But it's private.

I mean, you can just smell it.

593
00:31:51,945 --> 00:31:54,506
- Ahem.
- And it is delicious, darling.

594
00:31:54,542 --> 00:31:56,846
Bigby, we really are in a time crunch.

595
00:31:56,871 --> 00:31:58,057
- Mm-hmm.
- There's a lot at stake.

596
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,946

would be the case someday, hmm.

708
00:39:24,074 --> 00:39:26,041
your unique abilities.

709
00:39:26,066 --> 00:39:30,430
[groaning]

710
00:39:30,465 --> 00:39:33,559
Well, I can never get buried
in a Jewish cemetery.

711
00:39:33,768 --> 00:39:37,729
- Are you even Jewish?
- No, but options.

712
00:39:37,754 --> 00:39:40,622
How much do I have to drink
so that I never have to hear

713
00:39:40,647 --> 00:39:42,775
- your voice again?
- Good.

714
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,967
Now for the painful part.

715
00:39:45,013 --> 00:39:46,756
That wasn't the painful part?

716
00:39:46,781 --> 00:39:49,892
Oh, no. Professor Li?

717
00:40:06,835 --> 00:40:09,769
[chittering]

718
00:40:11,204 --> 00:40:14,002
This is a Cacodemon.

719
00:40:14,408 --> 00:40:16,275
- Jesus.
- They'll grow much bigger.

720
00:40:16,361 --> 00:40:19,812
Unleash these and believe me,
they'll keep The Beast plenty busy.

721
00:40:20,002 --> 00:40:23,971
Each of you will be given a special word
to command your Cacodemon to attack.

722
00:40:24,194 --> 00:40:26,160
They're a one-shot weapon,

723
00:40:26,185 --> 00:40:28,018
so pick your moment with care.

724
00:40:28,189 --> 00:40:30,977
What are you, uh, gonna do with it?

725
00:40:31,659 --> 00:40:34,427
Lift your shirt, Quentin,
and turn around.

726
00:40:34,462 --> 00:40:35,828
Oh.

727
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:38,298
Those words never led to anything good.

728
00:40:38,466 --> 00:40:40,814
Well, almost never.

729
00:40:41,136 --> 00:40:44,070
- [chittering]

730
00:40:49,377 --> 00:40:52,311

731
00:40:54,015 --> 00:40:55,843
[panting]

732
00:40:55,943 --> 00:40:57,910
Right, next.

733
00:41:02,791 --> 00:41:06,102
Sire, it's working.

734
00:41:06,225 --> 00:41:07,946
Oh, great.

735
00:41:08,273 --> 00:41:11,274
- Mm, thank you.
- Thank you, my King.

736
00:41:11,833 --> 00:41:14,834
No, no. Thank the hell
that was my childhood.

737
00:41:14,869 --> 00:41:16,969
[whooshing]

738
00:41:19,974 --> 00:41:21,860
Oh, well, [clears throat]

739
00:41:22,043 --> 00:41:24,727
perfect timing, for once.

740
00:41:25,276 --> 00:41:27,209
[clears throat]

741
00:41:30,351 --> 00:41:34,058
Your High King has agricultural
tales to tell.

742
00:41:34,489 --> 00:41:37,354
I give you the reign of...

743
00:41:37,926 --> 00:41:39,544
King Shit.

744
00:41:40,428 --> 00:41:42,880
[knocking]

745
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:47,037

be dead without me, so...
