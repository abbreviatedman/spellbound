This is a Brakebills student workbook.

I'm not blind, Quentin, technically.

54
00:02:50,355 --> 00:02:53,322

means that a Brakebills student

55
00:02:53,358 --> 00:02:56,526
was in Fillory over a hundred years ago.

56
00:02:56,561 --> 00:02:59,028

access to the armory were...

57

Own it, pumpkin. The Monarchy.

58
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,201

but if The Beast gets to
the Wellspring right now

62
00:03:12,777 --> 00:03:16,345

- Have you heard of him?
- Her.

69
00:03:30,528 --> 00:03:33,950
Well, there is a note in here.

70
00:03:34,649 --> 00:03:36,565

00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:47,099
Well, if the stuffed shirts
and ninny nay-sayers

533
00:28:47,134 --> 00:28:49,501
hadn't outlawed Battle Magic
38 years ago,

534
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:52,771
then they would have it,
which you well know, Henry.

535
00:28:55,743 --> 00:28:57,743
You look hungry.

536
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,547
So why was Battle Magic outlawed?

537
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:05,625
[sighs] Humans least
attractive qualities.

538
00:29:06,053 --> 00:29:09,024
Panic and paranoia.

539
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:12,123
And there were several student
deaths that semester.

540
00:29:12,259 --> 00:29:14,770
Far fewer than the 1870s,

541
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:17,091
or the 1920s, or the '60s.

542
00:29:17,498 --> 00:29:20,099
Another human failing, short memory.

543
00:29:22,903 --> 00:29:24,527
Hmm.

544
00:29:25,005 --> 00:29:27,902
You'd be the one casting. Good.

545
00:29:28,075 --> 00:29:30,769
It would burn anyone else to a crisp.

546
00:29:31,746 --> 00:29:35,108
I can feel your power. It's almost...

547
00:29:35,383 --> 00:29:38,919
[chuckles]
it's almost god-like.

548
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,317
Did you fuck one of them?

549
00:29:40,342 --> 00:29:42,588
I mean, they are wonderful, aren't they?

550
00:29:42,623 --> 00:29:43,856
At least mine was.

551
00:29:43,891 --> 00:29:46,833
I glowed for weeks. No, literally.

552
00:29:46,858 --> 00:29:48,761
I actually got mine
a little differently.

553
00:29:48,796 --> 00:29:51,563
Yes, and it's waning. Quite quickly.

554
00:29:51,686 --> 00:29:54,066
And so, Bigby, if you could
just please give us the spell.

555
00:29:54,101 --> 00:29:57,084
I don't give anything, Henry.
You of all people know that.

556
00:29:57,967 --> 00:29:59,669
So...

557
00:29:59,966 --> 00:30:02,262

Apologies for last night, dear wife.

560
00:30:14,028 --> 00:30:16,819
None required, my lord.

561
00:30:17,057 --> 00:30:20,546
I will need to find some way
to blow off steam.

562
00:30:20,639 --> 00:30:23,128
Somehow, someday. But in the meantime,

563
00:30:23,164 --> 00:30:26,976
I get to stroll
the wondrous memory fields

564
00:30:27,001 --> 00:30:29,335
of my agrarian childhood...

565
00:30:29,797 --> 00:30:32,219
sprinkling shit.

566
00:30:33,607 --> 00:30:35,781
Sprinkling... shit?

567
00:30:35,806 --> 00:30:38,544
Shoveling, mixing, drying, hauling.

568
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:40,045
Sorry.

569
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,774
Sprinkling it on... what?

570
00:30:43,502 --> 00:30:45,702
Crops.

571
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,669
Oh.

572
00:30:47,988 --> 00:30:50,192
Fertilizer?

573
00:30:51,915 --> 00:30:54,860
Your farmers don't fertilize?

574
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:02,242
So it's the only thing we've
found that might stop The Beast.

575
00:31:02,267 --> 00:31:04,281
I mean, it was amazing reading about how

576
00:31:04,306 --> 00:31:07,101
you used the Rhinemann at Gettysburg
to help win the war for the Union.

577
00:31:07,126 --> 00:31:09,796
Right. And it was you
who slipped it to Rupert Chatwin

578
00:31:09,814 --> 00:31:11,547
for the Battle of the Bulge.

579
00:31:11,583 --> 00:31:12,982
I mean, you changed history.

580
00:31:13,007 --> 00:31:15,584
Oh, I did, yes. Many times.

581
00:31:16,821 --> 00:31:20,428
Henry, is that juniper tree still there?

582
00:31:20,592 --> 00:31:22,950
You know, the one by the infirmary.

583
00:31:23,161 --> 00:31:27,430
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, it has the softest grass.

584
00:31:27,465 --> 00:31:29,723
It feels delicious on your ass.

585
00:31:29,834 --> 00:31:31,567
I mean, we used to sneak out
at night and,

586
00:31:31,603 --> 00:31:34,800
- oh, for hours we would...
- Bigby, please.

587
00:31:34,825 --> 00:31:37,340
Are you telling me you don't
even remember that tree?

588
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:40,076
Of course I do, darling. Of course.

589
00:31:40,111 --> 00:31:41,944
- But it's private.

00:31:46,261 --> 00:31:47,924
I mean, you can just smell it.

593
00:31:48,025 --> 00:31:50,586
- Ahem.
- And it is delicious, darling.

594
00:31:50,622 --> 00:31:52,926
Bigby, we really are in a time crunch.

595
00:31:52,951 --> 00:31:54,137
- Mm-hmm.
- There's a lot at stake.

596
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:57,026

would be the case someday, hmm.

708
00:39:19,214 --> 00:39:21,181
your unique abilities.

709
00:39:21,206 --> 00:39:25,570
[groaning]

710
00:39:25,605 --> 00:39:28,699
Well, I can never get buried
in a Jewish cemetery.

711
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:32,869
- Are you even Jewish?
- No, but options.

712
00:39:32,894 --> 00:39:35,762
How much do I have to drink
so that I never have to hear

713
00:39:35,787 --> 00:39:37,915
- your voice again?
- Good.

714
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:40,107
Now for the painful part.

715
00:39:40,153 --> 00:39:41,896
That wasn't the painful part?

716
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:45,032
Oh, no. Professor Li?

717
00:40:01,975 --> 00:40:04,909
[chittering]

718
00:40:06,344 --> 00:40:09,142
This is a Cacodemon.

719
00:40:09,548 --> 00:40:11,415
- Jesus.
- They'll grow much bigger.

720
00:40:11,501 --> 00:40:14,952
Unleash these and believe me,
they'll keep The Beast plenty busy.

721
00:40:15,142 --> 00:40:19,111
Each of you will be given a special word
to command your Cacodemon to attack.

722
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:21,300
They're a one-shot weapon,

723
00:40:21,325 --> 00:40:23,158
so pick your moment with care.

724
00:40:23,329 --> 00:40:26,117
What are you, uh, gonna do with it?

725
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:29,567
Lift your shirt, Quentin,
and turn around.

726
00:40:29,602 --> 00:40:30,968
Oh.

727
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:33,438
Those words never led to anything good.

728
00:40:33,606 --> 00:40:35,954
Well, almost never.

729
00:40:36,276 --> 00:40:39,210
- [chittering]
- [screaming]

730
00:40:44,517 --> 00:40:47,451
[screaming]

731
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,983
[panting]

732
00:40:51,083 --> 00:40:53,050
Right, next.

733
00:40:57,931 --> 00:41:01,242
Sire, it's working.

734
00:41:01,365 --> 00:41:03,086
Oh, great.

735
00:41:03,413 --> 00:41:06,414
- Mm, thank you.
- Thank you, my King.

736
00:41:06,973 --> 00:41:09,974
No, no. Thank the hell
that was my childhood.

737
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,109
[whooshing]

738
00:41:15,114 --> 00:41:17,000
Oh, well, [clears throat]

739
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:19,867
perfect timing, for once.

740
00:41:20,416 --> 00:41:22,349
[clears throat]

741
00:41:25,491 --> 00:41:29,198
Your High King has agricultural
tales to tell.

742
00:41:29,629 --> 00:41:32,494
I give you the reign of...

743
00:41:33,066 --> 00:41:34,684
King Shit.

744
00:41:35,568 --> 00:41:38,020
[knocking]

745
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:42,177

be dead without me, so...
