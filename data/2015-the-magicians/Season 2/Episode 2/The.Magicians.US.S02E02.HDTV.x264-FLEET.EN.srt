1
00:00:00,297 --> 00:00:02,297
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:02,298 --> 00:00:04,135
I hesitated, but The Beast,
I should have...

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,617
- it's my fault.
- No, it's not.

4
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:09,190
It's Julia's fault.

5
00:00:09,225 --> 00:00:10,858
You know how to deal with gods.

6
00:00:10,893 --> 00:00:12,860
You know how to fuck up their shit.

7
00:00:12,895 --> 00:00:15,297
- Julia, no.
- I want to make a deal.

8
00:00:15,322 --> 00:00:18,061
No, guys, she... she's not sane.

9
00:00:18,086 --> 00:00:20,404
One small consolation is
the bitch is with The Beast

10
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:23,073
right now and I can't really see
that going her way.

11
00:00:23,108 --> 00:00:24,875
Word as bond.

12
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:27,390
I assume the extra bits
enchant the blade

13
00:00:27,446 --> 00:00:30,681
to kill me instantly
in the event I break it.

14
00:00:30,716 --> 00:00:32,082
You guys are from Brakebills?

15
00:00:32,118 --> 00:00:35,519
Dude, Josh Hoberman, class of '16.

16
00:00:35,554 --> 00:00:37,287
Come with me if you want to live.

17
00:00:37,323 --> 00:00:40,491
Yeah, Josh and Victoria
bailed, on one hand.

18
00:00:40,526 --> 00:00:43,460
On the other hand,
you can't really blame them.

19
00:00:43,496 --> 00:00:44,934
I'm Marina.

20
00:00:44,959 --> 00:00:47,965
- So you were...
- Top bitch in New York for starters.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,868
- Welcome back to Brakebills.
- Wait, you went here?

22
00:00:50,903 --> 00:00:53,003
Kicked out three months
before graduation.

23
00:00:53,038 --> 00:00:55,839
- Let's go steal their shit.
- So there's a bump.

24
00:00:55,875 --> 00:00:58,175
Bigger than marrying
a total stranger-ette?

25
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:00,511
Once you get married,
you won't be able to be

26
00:01:00,546 --> 00:01:02,379
with anyone else, literally.

27
00:01:02,414 --> 00:01:04,982
But when I go back...

28
00:01:05,017 --> 00:01:07,184
I can never leave Fillory.

29
00:01:07,219 --> 00:01:10,487
Please fix my hands.

30
00:01:10,523 --> 00:01:13,190
See, how do I put this
in a way that you'll understand?

31
00:01:13,225 --> 00:01:15,692
Go fuck yourself.

32
00:01:15,728 --> 00:01:18,061
According to the best
and only magic we have,

33
00:01:18,097 --> 00:01:20,564
The Beast will kill us, end of story.

34
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:22,699
Okay, zillion bucks
says The Beast comes back

35
00:01:22,735 --> 00:01:24,501
any minute, so what's the plan?

36
00:01:24,537 --> 00:01:27,671
We lost the blade,
so we need a new something,

37
00:01:27,706 --> 00:01:29,173
especially while Alice is still...

38
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:31,308
Watch your step...
wait, this is something.

39
00:01:31,343 --> 00:01:34,511
It's a workbook on spells, serious ones,

40
00:01:34,547 --> 00:01:36,013
but the actual spells aren't here.

41
00:01:36,048 --> 00:01:38,148
I know where we need to go.

42
00:01:38,184 --> 00:01:40,041
Brakebills?

43
00:01:56,535 --> 00:02:00,704
I don't get it. How come nobody
in a hood is trying to kill us?

44
00:02:06,812 --> 00:02:09,112
Okay, that's just weird.

45
00:02:09,148 --> 00:02:12,082
You want to stop and
figure it out, be my guest.

46
00:02:29,301 --> 00:02:31,568
You're alive.

47
00:02:31,604 --> 00:02:33,537
What a lovely surprise.

48
00:02:37,009 --> 00:02:38,811
Okay, so...

49
00:02:39,006 --> 00:02:44,092
the castle armory was
basically empty, except for this.

50
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:46,617
This is a Brakebills student workbook.

51
00:02:46,652 --> 00:02:49,419
I'm not blind, Quentin, technically.

52
00:02:49,455 --> 00:02:52,422
From 1893, so I guess that
means that a Brakebills student

53
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:55,626
was in Fillory over a hundred years ago.

54
00:02:55,661 --> 00:02:58,128
And the only humans that had
access to the armory were...

55
00:02:58,163 --> 00:03:01,565
Own it, pumpkin. The Monarchy.

56
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,301
So we are not the first
Brakebills students

57
00:03:04,336 --> 00:03:06,470
to get into Fillory
or to assume the throne.

58
00:03:06,505 --> 00:03:08,772
It's a great question for history class,

59
00:03:08,807 --> 00:03:11,842
but if The Beast gets to
the Wellspring right now

60
00:03:11,877 --> 00:03:15,445
and sucks it bone-dry,
magic dies in Fillory.

61
00:03:15,481 --> 00:03:19,082
- It dies there...
- It dies here.

62
00:03:19,118 --> 00:03:21,818
On Earth.

63
00:03:21,854 --> 00:03:23,353
My God.

64
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:25,643
So the Battle Magic
that this student learned here,

65
00:03:25,668 --> 00:03:27,322
he learned from a professor named Bigby.

66
00:03:27,347 --> 00:03:29,593
- Have you heard of him?
- Her.

67
00:03:29,628 --> 00:03:33,050
Well, there is a note in here.

68
00:03:33,749 --> 00:03:35,665
There's a spell that seems strong enough

69
00:03:35,701 --> 00:03:37,400
called the Rhinemann Ultra...

70
00:03:37,436 --> 00:03:39,436
Right, but the spell
isn't actually here.

71
00:03:39,471 --> 00:03:41,304
Because why should anything be easy?

72
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,573
Shit. Shit! Duck!

73
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:45,642
- Who?
- Everybody!

74
00:03:49,348 --> 00:03:52,682
What the hell is that about?

75
00:03:52,718 --> 00:03:56,486
Uh, it's semi-not related
to any of this,

76
00:03:56,521 --> 00:03:58,989
but I think I know a temp fix.

77
00:03:59,024 --> 00:04:01,992
All right.

78
00:04:02,027 --> 00:04:03,093
I'll get back to you.

87
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:36,893

You mind? I'm working.

93
00:04:55,947 --> 00:04:58,915
It's still too similar to the
first sigil that summoned him.

94
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,918
He'll know it's you. And a trap.

95
00:05:01,953 --> 00:05:03,920
You're welcome to have an actual idea.

96
00:05:03,955 --> 00:05:06,356
Oh, no, I'd ruin your primitive purity.

97
00:05:06,391 --> 00:05:07,857
That's part of what attracts him.

98
00:05:07,893 --> 00:05:09,859
You're an absolute savage, Julia.

99
00:05:09,895 --> 00:05:12,028
Look, I know you're basically
stoned on sugar,

100
00:05:12,064 --> 00:05:13,863
but if you could just
dial down the chipper...

101
00:05:15,033 --> 00:05:18,101
All I do is accept what you fight.

102
00:05:18,136 --> 00:05:19,969
Yeah.

103
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,524
- Which is?
- Life is pointless.

104
00:05:23,549 --> 00:05:25,508
The after-life even more so.

105
00:05:25,544 --> 00:05:27,430
Which is why we invent these games

106
00:05:27,455 --> 00:05:29,412
to fill the void of existence.

107
00:05:29,448 --> 00:05:32,182
Who diddled whom.
Who'll get revenge for it.

108
00:05:32,217 --> 00:05:34,017
Who takes the throne.

109
00:05:34,052 --> 00:05:37,253
Yeah, well, that would be me,
actually, and my friends.

110
00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:39,122
Ah, well, I doubt
they're your friends anymore.

111
00:05:39,157 --> 00:05:43,226
And, uh, they won't be royals long. Huh.

112
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:45,095
Why?

113
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:48,455
Uh, maybe you could use a bit of help
with the Binding Principle.

114
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:51,034
Did you put some kind of curse
on the castle?

115
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:52,518
Did I?

116
00:05:53,672 --> 00:05:55,883
It was so long ago.

117
00:05:56,174 --> 00:05:58,001
I hardly remember.

118
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,566
The throne room, Sire.

119
00:06:13,492 --> 00:06:16,626
Can't be that hard to find dead rats.

120
00:06:19,874 --> 00:06:21,115
Wait, wait, wait, yes.

121
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:24,531
I-I believe I did work up
a little welcome.

122
00:06:24,656 --> 00:06:28,421
Yes, since Ember made it impossible
for me to retake the throne

123
00:06:28,573 --> 00:06:30,707
and the Children of Earth
kept coming and coming,

124
00:06:30,742 --> 00:06:34,244
drunk on self-love and power-lust.

125
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:38,081
Yes, I thought of it
as a kind of royal test...

126
00:06:38,116 --> 00:06:39,949
that no one ever passed.

127
00:06:41,453 --> 00:06:42,752
Sadly.

128
00:06:42,788 --> 00:06:44,354
What kind of test?

129
00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:46,656
Ah, that's something
for each new despot to, uh,

130
00:06:46,692 --> 00:06:49,659
puzzle out themselves. Anyway.

131
00:06:49,695 --> 00:06:51,528
You're on the right track.

132
00:06:51,563 --> 00:06:54,931
Now we just need the bait.

133
00:06:54,966 --> 00:06:58,635
As soon as I'm finished
with this, I'm ready.

134
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,770
He knows you.

135
00:07:00,806 --> 00:07:03,106
A bit too intimately.

136
00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:06,609
No, I have the perfect fresh candidate.

137
00:07:06,645 --> 00:07:10,046
She's young, beautiful, female,
and a very powerful witch.

138
00:07:10,082 --> 00:07:12,015
No.

139
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,711
- Julia.
- Let's skip the discussion.

140
00:07:13,736 --> 00:07:16,040
You do as I say or this...

141
00:07:18,575 --> 00:07:20,296
does its job,

142
00:07:20,727 --> 00:07:21,974
per the bond.

143
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:24,232
Oh, well, technically,
the Leo Blade cuts my throat

144
00:07:24,257 --> 00:07:26,557
if I attempt to harm you, your beloveds,

145
00:07:26,582 --> 00:07:28,287
or undermine your efforts.

146
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,825

00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:16,569
Uh, wait, the cottage was here, right?

155
00:08:19,217 --> 00:08:22,418
It's not invisible, it's just... not.

156
00:08:22,454 --> 00:08:25,355
Oh, shit, right.

157
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:29,192
End of semester prank
to ditch the first-year losers.

158
00:08:29,227 --> 00:08:31,979
I should've remembered, it was my idea.

159
00:08:32,114 --> 00:08:33,557
Are you...

160
00:08:33,885 --> 00:08:35,581
I hate all of you.

161
00:08:35,676 --> 00:08:38,580
- I hate all of you.
- Could we just find the cottage, please.

162
00:08:45,143 --> 00:08:48,008
Mm, promising.

163
00:08:50,081 --> 00:08:52,816
To the first bottle
of Fillorian champagne.

164
00:08:52,851 --> 00:08:54,784
Which I know technically
isn't champagne.

165
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,835
Except I am renaming the Royal
Gardens "Champagne Nouveau."

166
00:08:59,547 --> 00:09:02,192
Mm. Ugh.

167
00:09:02,227 --> 00:09:05,728
"Champagne no-no." Jesus.

168
00:09:05,764 --> 00:09:09,866
That makes no sense. I used the
go-to fermenting enchantment.

169
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:12,234
No fretting. I'll get it right.
Trial and error.

170
00:09:13,772 --> 00:09:17,008
I'm your wife. I want to be obedient.

171
00:09:17,142 --> 00:09:20,477
Sit down.

172
00:09:20,512 --> 00:09:23,379
Nobody wants to be obedient.

173
00:09:23,415 --> 00:09:26,881
I do want to serve you and Fillory,

174
00:09:28,153 --> 00:09:30,053
but...

175
00:09:30,489 --> 00:09:32,428
But...?

176
00:09:33,859 --> 00:09:37,227
Look, I'm okay being a king,

177
00:09:37,262 --> 00:09:40,203
but I don't want to run a cult.

178
00:09:40,432 --> 00:09:43,015
If anyone has a right
to speak up, it's you.

179
00:09:44,836 --> 00:09:48,218
There hasn't been a truly inspiring,

180
00:09:48,243 --> 00:09:50,273
caring ruler since Rupert Chatwin,

181
00:09:50,308 --> 00:09:52,342
and that was so long ago,
most barely remember.

182
00:09:52,377 --> 00:09:54,310
Look, I'm cleaning the place up.

183
00:09:54,346 --> 00:09:57,280
I'm trying to get
some decent wine going.

184
00:09:57,315 --> 00:09:59,082
What else is there?

185
00:09:59,117 --> 00:10:01,317
The people are starving.

186
00:10:01,353 --> 00:10:03,286
Seriously?

187
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,770
Oh, okay.
We should probably get on that.

188
00:10:10,061 --> 00:10:13,696
And I'm guessing magic
probably won't do the trick.

189
00:10:13,732 --> 00:10:15,913
Magic is the problem.

190
00:10:17,068 --> 00:10:19,905
Oh, boy.

191
00:10:37,689 --> 00:10:41,958
Yep. We're alive. Deal.

192
00:10:42,003 --> 00:10:44,592
Can you keep your shit tight
for a few more minutes?

193
00:10:46,264 --> 00:10:48,498
Couple minutes is all I'll need.

194
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:50,667
Drink, now.

195
00:10:50,702 --> 00:10:53,803
You deserting, chicken-shit
motherfucker.

196
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,914
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

197
00:10:58,276 --> 00:11:01,744
- No, goddammit!
- Like Lando and Han. Right on.

198
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,781
Oh!

199
00:11:07,085 --> 00:11:09,434
Still got my legs.

200
00:11:10,422 --> 00:11:13,256
Uh, so it true what Josh was saying?

201
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:16,025
Fillory's real, right? Right?

202
00:11:16,061 --> 00:11:18,027
Fillory is very real.

203
00:11:18,063 --> 00:11:20,563
Okay.

204
00:11:20,599 --> 00:11:24,267
And this is going to be
on the syllabus next semester?

205
00:11:24,302 --> 00:11:26,035
We shall see. But for now,

206
00:11:26,071 --> 00:11:29,606
Quentin, Alice, Penny,
and Margo need Battle Magic.

207
00:11:29,641 --> 00:11:32,442
We're going to teach Battle Magic now?

208
00:11:32,477 --> 00:11:34,277
It was once a required course.

209
00:11:34,312 --> 00:11:36,045
Till it was outlawed.

210
00:11:36,081 --> 00:11:37,614
For good reason, I hear.

211
00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:42,452
Yes, well,
it was a very messy situation.

212
00:11:42,487 --> 00:11:45,021
At the time, I thought it was right,

213
00:11:45,056 --> 00:11:47,123
but the professor
who taught it disagreed.

214
00:11:47,158 --> 00:11:49,092
Strongly. She was fired,

215
00:11:49,127 --> 00:11:52,195
and as she was escorted
off campus, she said that...

216
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,210
I'm sorry, Henry, this is fascinating,

217
00:11:54,235 --> 00:11:56,933
but why are you telling me this?

218
00:11:56,968 --> 00:11:59,135
The professor, Bigby,

219
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:03,072
hinted that she hid
all the Battle Magic spells

220
00:12:03,108 --> 00:12:05,575
somewhere on campus.

221
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:08,771
"You'll need them someday," she said,

222
00:12:09,514 --> 00:12:11,537
"And me."

223
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,285
Again, why?

224
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,098
All the Battle Magic spells
are hidden in the library.

225
00:12:19,457 --> 00:12:23,012
No one knows the library
better than you.

226
00:12:26,031 --> 00:12:28,332
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

227
00:12:28,357 --> 00:12:31,458
We both are. Seriously sorry.

228
00:12:31,636 --> 00:12:33,569
- So where's Victoria?
- Traveling.

229
00:12:33,605 --> 00:12:35,638
I don't even know
if she's on this planet anymore.

230
00:12:35,674 --> 00:12:38,408
Can't blame her.

231
00:12:38,443 --> 00:12:40,410
- Spit in it.
- What is it?

232
00:12:40,445 --> 00:12:43,146
It's a hangover cure El and I
used when we got the shakes.

233
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:45,648
I amped it up with Nightshade
and a couple of Ativans.

234
00:12:45,684 --> 00:12:48,588
Might make you a little woozy,
but it could do the trick...

235
00:12:52,557 --> 00:12:56,492
Temporarily. So keep a stash on you.

236
00:12:56,528 --> 00:12:58,127
It is good to see you guys, though.

237
00:12:58,163 --> 00:13:00,442
- Fuck off.
- Okay.

238
00:13:14,012 --> 00:13:16,476
This one...

239
00:13:17,132 --> 00:13:20,350
is sheer, hellcat perfection.

240
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,566
I don't give a shit about getting him.

241
00:13:28,762 --> 00:13:31,422
- You should.
- Look, I didn't summon him.

242
00:13:31,545 --> 00:13:33,622
I didn't get raped by him.

243
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:37,482
I have no skin in this except that
I want to kick your ass and kill him.

244
00:13:37,518 --> 00:13:40,185
♪ Fate may often treat me meanly ♪

245
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:45,013
♪ But I keenly pursue ♪

246
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:49,683
♪ A little mirage in the blue ♪

247
00:13:50,331 --> 00:13:52,652
Did you scrape him off
the cabaret floor?

248
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:54,499
Reynard is targeting Hedges.

249
00:13:54,535 --> 00:13:57,402
Right. So the answer is to
hire Michael Bublé to kidnap me

250
00:13:57,438 --> 00:13:59,237
and then use me as your bait.

251
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:01,239
If I'm wrong, raise your hand.

252
00:14:01,275 --> 00:14:03,675
Look, you're right.
It was wrong grabbing you

253
00:14:03,711 --> 00:14:06,244
the way that we did,
but sooner or later,

254
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,691
he was gonna find you.

255
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:10,582
- We need someone...
- Else, Julia.

256
00:14:10,617 --> 00:14:12,822
Or we have a problem.

257
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:15,150
Do you want a problem with me?

258
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:19,191
- Forget it.
- Great.

259
00:14:23,764 --> 00:14:25,931
I told you untying her was a mistake.

260
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:32,270
- Ow.
- What?

261
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:35,040
It's starting to burn a little.

262
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:36,441
Take it off.

263
00:14:36,477 --> 00:14:39,344
You know I can't. I need it.

264
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,314
The more it burns,
the less time we have.

265
00:14:44,418 --> 00:14:45,951
If it hurts, then...

266
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:48,920
Not everything that hurts is bad.

267
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:56,561
I hate that all of this is on you.

268
00:14:56,597 --> 00:15:00,198
You'd tell me if there was
something I could do.

269
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:02,552
Shift the weight off?

270
00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:07,005
Yeah, I'd tell you.

271
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:29,074
Look, she's a bitch on three wheels,

272
00:15:29,099 --> 00:15:32,207
probably bat-shit crazy,
but she's not wrong.

273
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:34,566
Did you find it?

274
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:37,069
I did. And?

275
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:38,737
Look, I know we made a pact.

276
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:41,073
I stick to my coast, you stick to yours.

277
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:43,075
But this might take
all the top Hedge bitches

278
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,444
to coven up and take this asshole out.

279
00:15:45,479 --> 00:15:47,155
Your coast or mine?

280
00:15:47,548 --> 00:15:49,481
I'm already on my way.

281
00:15:55,022 --> 00:15:59,591
So, if I'm understanding this,
things here grow magically.

282
00:15:59,731 --> 00:16:01,426
Until recently, yes.

283
00:16:01,528 --> 00:16:03,698
Everything always took care of itself.

284
00:16:03,877 --> 00:16:06,105
We used to grow all the nuts
in the southern region.

285
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:08,362
Until The Beast drained the magic.

286
00:16:08,502 --> 00:16:11,386
Now what's required is actual farm work.

287
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:15,138
Which no one in Fillory knows how to do.

288
00:16:17,878 --> 00:16:22,147
Ah, I think I'm getting
one of those migraines

289
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:25,071
where everything gets all bendy.

290
00:16:25,837 --> 00:16:27,493
Please God, let me pass out.

291
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:32,292
No? All right.

292
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,759
Fen?

293
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:39,531
I have a secret.

294
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:41,500
It's fairly difficult for me to confess.

295
00:16:41,535 --> 00:16:45,807
And it brings me nothing but
waves of aching nausea, but...

296
00:16:47,085 --> 00:16:48,416
I grew up...

297
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:50,842
on a farm.

298
00:16:50,992 --> 00:16:52,691
That's your secret?

299
00:16:52,716 --> 00:16:54,864
I spent years blocking it all out.

300
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:58,383
The smell of wet hay.

301
00:16:58,747 --> 00:17:01,586
And the feel of an udder.

302
00:17:01,622 --> 00:17:04,446
The taste of fresh...

303
00:17:04,892 --> 00:17:06,324
goat milk.

304
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,242
And the worst humans
in the known universe:

305
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,704
my family.

306
00:17:12,566 --> 00:17:15,000
It's coming back
and if it all comes back,

307
00:17:15,025 --> 00:17:16,701
I'm pretty sure I'll know
exactly what to do.

308
00:17:16,737 --> 00:17:20,115
- That's wonderful.
- On a planet with no Zoloft.

309
00:17:20,274 --> 00:17:22,373
Now you sound like my king.

310
00:17:22,576 --> 00:17:24,142
Mm.

311
00:17:27,441 --> 00:17:30,282
So then, if I just needed
one little thing from you to...

312
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:33,043
to ease my agony?

313
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,897
- Anything.
- Mm.

314
00:17:34,922 --> 00:17:36,755
There's my girl.

315
00:17:38,818 --> 00:17:41,504
_

316
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:44,696
Professor Bigby was brilliant,
impatient, stubborn,

317
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:47,894
and mercurial. And a 500-year-old pixie.

318
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:50,902
Who more or less saw humans
as children to be toyed with.

319
00:17:51,389 --> 00:17:54,389
If she's as good as her word, and one
thing she certainly wasn't was a liar,

320
00:17:54,414 --> 00:17:57,409
then her book of Battle Magic
will be found here.

321
00:17:57,444 --> 00:17:59,744
- In this room.
- Why?

322
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,880
She told me. "The Battle Magic will be

323
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,582
"where the knowledge always is.

324
00:18:03,617 --> 00:18:05,797
"The day you need it, I promise,

325
00:18:05,953 --> 00:18:08,310
it will be your last hope."

326
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:11,246
Uh, those were
here exact words, "last hope."

327
00:18:11,271 --> 00:18:12,440
Yes.

328
00:18:12,465 --> 00:18:13,903
Well, that's the name of one

329
00:18:13,928 --> 00:18:15,627
of the more powerful texts
on Battle Magic.

330
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:17,199
"Last Hope Options."

331
00:18:17,224 --> 00:18:20,899
Yes, of course.
Pixies love puzzles and riddles.

332
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,160
Especially those
that make humans look stupid.

333
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,309
She gave me the title of the
book that we're searching for,

334
00:18:25,334 --> 00:18:28,306
but I'm afraid that it will be
very hard to find.

335
00:18:28,342 --> 00:18:29,474
Let's get to it.

336
00:18:31,645 --> 00:18:33,178
"Rhinemann."

337
00:18:37,451 --> 00:18:39,284
"The Rhinemann Exchange."

338
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:42,429
A spy novel by Robert Ludlum.

339
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:44,125
What's next?

340
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:47,625
"Last Hope Options" is an anagram for...

341
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,506
"Pane Hotspot Silo"?

342
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,202
All right, let's try assigning

343
00:18:58,227 --> 00:18:59,504
a different number structure
to the letters.

344
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:03,008
For instance, A is 11, B is 22,
C is 44, and so on.

345
00:19:03,085 --> 00:19:05,443
- Okay.
- Ahem.

346
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:11,016
"Tat Loosens Hippo,"
"Opine Path Stools."

347
00:19:19,393 --> 00:19:21,326
Pixie puzzles.

348
00:19:41,417 --> 00:19:44,384
Penny, what's... what's happened
to your hands?

349
00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:46,151
What hasn't?

350
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:48,550
- Tell me.
- Why?

351
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:53,208
Maybe I can help.

352
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,036
- Nada.
- Ugh. Professor?

353
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:58,396
I can safely say
that none of the number codes

354
00:19:58,432 --> 00:20:00,365
we came up with led to anything.

355
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,934
We found about 300 anagram phrases.

356
00:20:03,027 --> 00:20:04,738
Anything promising?

357
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:07,672
Uh, well, uh,

358
00:20:07,777 --> 00:20:10,980
"Hospital Nose Top" mean anything?

359
00:20:11,111 --> 00:20:14,679
What about, uh, "Latte Shop Poison"?

360
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:17,962
No? Not surprising.

361
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:20,251
Uh, oh, this one's good.

362
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:23,121
This is my favorite because it's absurd.

363
00:20:23,156 --> 00:20:25,590
Uh, "Hotel Spa Potions."

364
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,355
Wait.

365
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:30,428
That's a book. In here.

366
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:44,442
- Yeah.
- "Last Hope Options."

367
00:20:44,478 --> 00:20:45,410
Ah.

368
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:53,502
The chapter's been ripped out.

369
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,536
Wait, there's a note.

370
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:57,419
"Hello, Henry.

371
00:20:57,657 --> 00:20:59,424
"If you're reading this, I was right

372
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:01,659
"and everyone else
at Brakebills was wrong.

373
00:21:01,695 --> 00:21:03,261
"How delightful.

374
00:21:03,427 --> 00:21:07,799
"It also means I'll see you
quick as one, two, nine.

375
00:21:07,943 --> 00:21:10,271
"Where middle leads and last is fine,

376
00:21:10,468 --> 00:21:12,513
"summer's here and ne'er retreats,

377
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:15,903
a pretty island made of streets."

378
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:18,209
Another riddle. Awesome.

379
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,707
Oh. Well, if it's, like,
where to find her?

380
00:21:21,732 --> 00:21:24,138
"Island made of streets"
is Rhode Island.

381
00:21:24,684 --> 00:21:27,528
What? Duh.

382
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,160
Sorry. Could you spell
your last name again?

383
00:21:37,371 --> 00:21:39,668
I would, but...

384
00:21:40,621 --> 00:21:42,500
you're asleep.

385
00:22:07,073 --> 00:22:08,721
You said anything.

386
00:22:08,814 --> 00:22:11,483
But this is... this is...

387
00:22:15,415 --> 00:22:17,584
Am I not enough for you?

388
00:22:19,552 --> 00:22:21,541
You're great.

389
00:22:21,788 --> 00:22:24,288
For... who you are.

390
00:22:24,324 --> 00:22:27,885
It's just... I already told you.
My life was different before.

391
00:22:28,061 --> 00:22:29,227
Yeah.

392
00:22:29,392 --> 00:22:32,118
And I'll help you make a new life.

393
00:22:33,233 --> 00:22:35,912
Well, this is new.

394
00:22:35,984 --> 00:22:38,373
And right inside the lines of marriage.

395
00:22:38,538 --> 00:22:41,154
We just do what we do in bed,

396
00:22:41,341 --> 00:22:44,424
and they do what they do.

397
00:22:44,577 --> 00:22:46,544
I only picked people
already doing each other.

398
00:22:46,569 --> 00:22:48,503
And we get to watch.

399
00:22:52,052 --> 00:22:53,351
You guys are all cool with this, right?

400
00:22:53,386 --> 00:22:55,974
- Mm-hmm.
See?

401
00:22:57,357 --> 00:22:59,057
You're their king.

402
00:22:59,092 --> 00:23:01,291
They will do as you wish,
no matter how...

403
00:23:01,316 --> 00:23:03,594
- Fun.
- Debased.

404
00:23:03,619 --> 00:23:05,285
Debased?

405
00:23:05,432 --> 00:23:08,918
Honey-love, I've been doing
this shit since I was 12,

406
00:23:09,069 --> 00:23:11,348
except on a computer.

407
00:23:11,538 --> 00:23:13,247
I don't know what that means,

408
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,130
but...

409
00:23:15,923 --> 00:23:18,333
if it's what you desire...

410
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,408
All right. Good night, everyone. Thanks.

411
00:23:25,526 --> 00:23:27,414
You all look really good naked.

412
00:23:27,415 --> 00:23:29,283
- Thank you, Sire.
- Your Majesty.

413
00:23:38,264 --> 00:23:42,033
Well, I guess life
is about new experiences,

414
00:23:42,097 --> 00:23:44,081
and, uh, I've never been
pussy-whipped, so...

415
00:23:51,077 --> 00:23:52,507
You're doomed.

416
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,312
Which I might find amusing
except it's likely

417
00:23:56,337 --> 00:23:58,390
to get me killed.

418
00:23:58,651 --> 00:24:00,835
And for what?

419
00:24:01,087 --> 00:24:03,809
Because no matter what,
I'm going to hold on to my...

420
00:24:03,834 --> 00:24:05,645
If you say "humanity"
you'll learn I can vomit

421
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,603
non-stop for two hours.

422
00:24:11,664 --> 00:24:14,195
You know, I'm about to make
an enemy of a god

423
00:24:14,334 --> 00:24:17,125
who I have no quarrel with.

424
00:24:17,403 --> 00:24:19,370
And without decent bait,
you're literally asking me

425
00:24:19,395 --> 00:24:23,320
to do it blindfolded, shackled,
and hopping on one leg.

426
00:24:25,132 --> 00:24:28,734
If... if I took just a smidgen
of your Shade,

427
00:24:28,828 --> 00:24:32,351
not only would your trauma drop away,

428
00:24:33,019 --> 00:24:35,618
you'd have no issue with using Marina.

429
00:24:35,755 --> 00:24:38,523
You'd be free of these useless feelings

430
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:41,110
and this idiotic moral quagmire.

431
00:24:41,327 --> 00:24:43,661
Come near me
and the knife won't kill you.

432
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:46,021
'Cause you can still live
without a dick.

433
00:24:51,247 --> 00:24:53,568
♪ Life is very rough and tumble ♪

434
00:24:53,685 --> 00:24:55,540
Or a tongue.

435
00:25:03,783 --> 00:25:06,649
So Rhode Island
was just beginner's luck.

436
00:25:07,587 --> 00:25:11,743
Okay, uh, okay, "Summer's here
and ne'er retreats."

437
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:16,495
So "ne'er retreats," it's, uh,
it's set. "Summer is set."

438
00:25:16,763 --> 00:25:19,089
"Somer... Somerset. Somerset."

439
00:25:19,114 --> 00:25:20,284
Somerset.

440
00:25:20,309 --> 00:25:21,714
And the numbers could be
a street address.

441
00:25:21,739 --> 00:25:23,538
Right.

442
00:25:23,736 --> 00:25:27,335
"Quick as one, two, nine.
Middle is first, last is fine."

443
00:25:28,041 --> 00:25:32,113
219. So it's 219 something Somerset.

444
00:25:43,723 --> 00:25:46,657
Oh, come on.

445
00:25:55,435 --> 00:25:57,421
I think I can help.

446
00:26:01,824 --> 00:26:03,152
- Sorry, sir.
- Yes?

447
00:26:03,177 --> 00:26:05,110
We've had a security breach.

448
00:26:15,056 --> 00:26:16,658
Marina.

449
00:26:16,822 --> 00:26:18,967
Please.

450
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,396
I need asylum.

451
00:26:27,116 --> 00:26:29,132
Marina.

452
00:26:29,452 --> 00:26:32,593
What else can you tell me about this...

453
00:26:32,848 --> 00:26:34,624
situation?

454
00:26:43,966 --> 00:26:47,247
Well, for starters,
it's not a "situation."

455
00:26:47,437 --> 00:26:49,437
It's a raping, killing, omniscient god

456
00:26:49,462 --> 00:26:52,886
with a pretty specific type:
me and mine.

457
00:26:53,743 --> 00:26:55,376
What the fuck else do you need to know?

458
00:26:55,411 --> 00:26:58,245
I see you still don't
expend much on good manners.

459
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,547
What, this is a charm school now?

460
00:26:59,582 --> 00:27:02,239
No, but it is my school.

461
00:27:02,418 --> 00:27:04,184
Not a safe house.

462
00:27:04,454 --> 00:27:06,645
I was the best student
you ever had here.

463
00:27:06,789 --> 00:27:08,265
You said that.

464
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:10,735
I confused talent with character.

465
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,794
You need both
to be a true magician, Marina.

466
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,985
Kicking you out wasn't a choice.

467
00:27:16,132 --> 00:27:18,074
I couldn't have you
infecting my students then

468
00:27:18,099 --> 00:27:20,233
and I certainly won't now.

469
00:27:27,844 --> 00:27:30,230
You fucking prick.

470
00:27:32,315 --> 00:27:34,994
- Where am I supposed to go?
- You can keep your memories.

471
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:38,285
I hope that whatever you've
learned here will help keep you safe.

472
00:27:38,431 --> 00:27:40,621
What I learned here will get me killed.

473
00:27:57,306 --> 00:28:00,256
Remember, pixies are tricky.

474
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:03,310
Keep all questions and answers
short and to the point.

475
00:28:03,346 --> 00:28:05,084
- You understand?
- Henry.

476
00:28:05,181 --> 00:28:07,951
- Ah, yes.
- Henry, you look awful.

477
00:28:08,117 --> 00:28:09,850
What happened to your eyes?
Are you blind?

478
00:28:09,886 --> 00:28:12,436
And your... your hair.
Henry, you look ancient.

479
00:28:12,461 --> 00:28:14,188
Very nice of you to say so, dear.

480
00:28:14,223 --> 00:28:15,641
Oh, no wonder you sought me out.

481
00:28:15,666 --> 00:28:19,225
I mean, you've been
positively mauled by something.

482
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,698
Bigby, let me intro...

483
00:28:21,469 --> 00:28:24,026
Mmm.

484
00:28:24,575 --> 00:28:26,378
Some things haven't changed.

485
00:28:26,403 --> 00:28:30,208
You still are the most wonderful kisser.

486
00:28:30,572 --> 00:28:31,939
Do you have time to go to bed with me?

487
00:28:31,974 --> 00:28:34,875
We are a bit on the clock, darling.

488
00:28:34,911 --> 00:28:36,756
And these are my students.

489
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:38,340
They are in need of the Rhinemann Ultra.

490
00:28:38,365 --> 00:28:39,840
- Are they now?
- Oh, yes.

491
00:28:39,865 --> 00:28:41,949
Well, if the stuffed shirts
and ninny nay-sayers

492
00:28:41,984 --> 00:28:44,351
hadn't outlawed Battle Magic
38 years ago,

493
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,621
then they would have it,
which you well know, Henry.

494
00:28:50,593 --> 00:28:52,593
You look hungry.

495
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:56,397
So why was Battle Magic outlawed?

496
00:28:56,465 --> 00:29:00,475
Humans least attractive qualities.

497
00:29:00,903 --> 00:29:03,874
Panic and paranoia.

498
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,973
And there were several student
deaths that semester.

499
00:29:07,109 --> 00:29:09,620
Far fewer than the 1870s,

500
00:29:09,645 --> 00:29:11,941
or the 1920s, or the '60s.

501
00:29:12,348 --> 00:29:14,949
Another human failing, short memory.

502
00:29:17,753 --> 00:29:19,377
Hmm.

503
00:29:19,855 --> 00:29:22,752
You'd be the one casting. Good.

504
00:29:22,925 --> 00:29:25,619
It would burn anyone else to a crisp.

505
00:29:26,596 --> 00:29:29,958
I can feel your power. It's almost...

506
00:29:30,233 --> 00:29:33,769
it's almost god-like.

507
00:29:33,794 --> 00:29:35,167
Did you fuck one of them?

508
00:29:35,192 --> 00:29:37,438
I mean, they are wonderful, aren't they?

509
00:29:37,473 --> 00:29:38,706
At least mine was.

510
00:29:38,741 --> 00:29:41,683
I glowed for weeks. No, literally.

511
00:29:41,708 --> 00:29:43,611
I actually got mine
a little differently.

512
00:29:43,646 --> 00:29:46,413
Yes, and it's waning. Quite quickly.

513
00:29:46,536 --> 00:29:48,916
And so, Bigby, if you could
just please give us the spell.

514
00:29:48,951 --> 00:29:51,934
I don't give anything, Henry.
You of all people know that.

515
00:29:52,817 --> 00:29:54,519
So...

516
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:57,112
well, convince me.

517
00:29:59,161 --> 00:30:02,263
Where the hell is the Burnt River?

518
00:30:04,567 --> 00:30:08,725
Apologies for last night, dear wife.

519
00:30:08,878 --> 00:30:11,669
None required, my lord.

520
00:30:11,907 --> 00:30:15,396
I will need to find some way
to blow off steam.

521
00:30:15,489 --> 00:30:17,978
Somehow, someday. But in the meantime,

522
00:30:18,014 --> 00:30:21,826
I get to stroll
the wondrous memory fields

523
00:30:21,851 --> 00:30:24,185
of my agrarian childhood...

524
00:30:24,647 --> 00:30:27,069
sprinkling shit.

525
00:30:28,457 --> 00:30:30,631
Sprinkling... shit?

526
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:33,394
Shoveling, mixing, drying, hauling.

527
00:30:33,429 --> 00:30:34,895
Sorry.

528
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:37,624
Sprinkling it on... what?

529
00:30:38,352 --> 00:30:40,552
Crops.

530
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:42,519
Oh.

531
00:30:42,838 --> 00:30:45,042
Fertilizer?

532
00:30:46,765 --> 00:30:49,710
Your farmers don't fertilize?

533
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,092
So it's the only thing we've
found that might stop The Beast.

534
00:30:57,117 --> 00:30:59,131
I mean, it was amazing reading about how

535
00:30:59,156 --> 00:31:01,951
you used the Rhinemann at Gettysburg
to help win the war for the Union.

536
00:31:01,976 --> 00:31:04,646
Right. And it was you
who slipped it to Rupert Chatwin

537
00:31:04,664 --> 00:31:06,397
for the Battle of the Bulge.

538
00:31:06,433 --> 00:31:07,832
I mean, you changed history.

539
00:31:07,857 --> 00:31:10,434
Oh, I did, yes. Many times.

540
00:31:11,671 --> 00:31:15,278
Henry, is that juniper tree still there?

541
00:31:15,442 --> 00:31:17,800
You know, the one by the infirmary.

542
00:31:18,011 --> 00:31:22,280
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, it has the softest grass.

543
00:31:22,315 --> 00:31:24,573
It feels delicious on your ass.

544
00:31:24,684 --> 00:31:26,417
I mean, we used to sneak out
at night and,

545
00:31:26,453 --> 00:31:29,650
- oh, for hours we would...
- Bigby, please.

546
00:31:29,675 --> 00:31:32,190
Are you telling me you don't
even remember that tree?

547
00:31:32,225 --> 00:31:34,926
Of course I do, darling. Of course.

548
00:31:34,961 --> 00:31:36,794
But it's private.

549
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,789
Well, not anymore.

550
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:41,086
Plus, these two fuck like jackrabbits.

551
00:31:41,111 --> 00:31:42,774
I mean, you can just smell it.

552
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:45,436
- Ahem.
- And it is delicious, darling.

553
00:31:45,472 --> 00:31:47,776
Bigby, we really are in a time crunch.

554
00:31:47,801 --> 00:31:48,987
- Mm-hmm.
- There's a lot at stake.

555
00:31:49,012 --> 00:31:51,876
Which I told you
would be the case someday, hmm.

556
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:54,620
Well, welcome to someday.

557
00:32:10,827 --> 00:32:14,471
No one but you can be
within 20 feet of the blast.

558
00:32:15,402 --> 00:32:18,449
It will kill anyone,
including your Beast.

559
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:21,831
As strong as he is, you're stronger.

560
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,712
But not for long. Hmm?

561
00:32:27,854 --> 00:32:30,963
So, stop prattling and get to it.

562
00:32:34,322 --> 00:32:37,706
Boys, the shit.

563
00:32:38,393 --> 00:32:41,192
Um, Sire, I do not wish
to appear ungrateful...

564
00:32:41,217 --> 00:32:44,063
You're just going to have
to trust your king on this one.

565
00:32:53,177 --> 00:32:57,726
Come on, lads. Many a farm to grace...

566
00:32:57,953 --> 00:33:01,218
with... our royal dung.

567
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:04,960
Yah! Come on!

568
00:33:18,345 --> 00:33:19,541
Ow.

569
00:33:20,525 --> 00:33:22,058
Shit.

570
00:33:22,203 --> 00:33:25,859
The time is 10:58 p.m.

571
00:33:27,942 --> 00:33:31,127
Alice, you're getting it, but...

572
00:33:31,221 --> 00:33:33,012
It's taking too long.

573
00:33:33,479 --> 00:33:35,515
I'm not as strong as I was.

574
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,111
By the time I'm fully powered up,

575
00:33:37,136 --> 00:33:38,877
The Beast will have eaten
all of our faces off.

576
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,288
You all are going to need
something strong to hit him with.

577
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:44,557
Bigby isn't the only one

578
00:33:44,769 --> 00:33:47,386
who tucked away a few secrets.

579
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,800
- Ah, ow!
- Sorry.

580
00:33:53,835 --> 00:33:56,308
The spell says it has to be tight.

581
00:33:56,905 --> 00:33:59,739
Do they have to be behind me?
I feel like I'm getting busted.

582
00:33:59,845 --> 00:34:02,475
You can't look at your hands
for 12 hours.

583
00:34:04,946 --> 00:34:06,413
Okay, whoa, what is that?

584
00:34:06,438 --> 00:34:08,407
I can't pronounce the name.

585
00:34:08,683 --> 00:34:10,216
It's from China.

586
00:34:10,343 --> 00:34:12,375
It'll keep the blood circulating,

587
00:34:12,587 --> 00:34:15,945
but take away a lot of the discomfort.

588
00:34:16,391 --> 00:34:18,898
Wait, that feels... ah!

589
00:34:21,817 --> 00:34:24,747
O... kay.

590
00:34:26,568 --> 00:34:30,330
I'm wondering if maybe you could
rub a little into my shoulder.

591
00:34:32,373 --> 00:34:34,635
Yeah, I got a cramp.

592
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:36,634
Which one?

593
00:34:36,978 --> 00:34:39,173
Both, actually.

594
00:35:14,015 --> 00:35:16,091
I feel guilty.

595
00:35:17,285 --> 00:35:19,118
Why?

596
00:35:19,289 --> 00:35:21,672
Letting you do all the work.

597
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:26,164
I don't mind.

598
00:35:26,422 --> 00:35:30,537
Still, if there's anything
I can do for you, let me know.

599
00:35:30,798 --> 00:35:34,334
I don't think you're in
a position to do much.

600
00:35:35,203 --> 00:35:36,920
Try me.

601
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:40,174
I might.

602
00:35:41,476 --> 00:35:42,972
After you graduate.

603
00:35:54,822 --> 00:35:57,673
- Jules.
- Q, hey.

604
00:35:57,814 --> 00:35:59,747
Hey.

605
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:04,038
Hey, um...

606
00:36:04,226 --> 00:36:07,726
I-I got your message in my
bathroom mirror. It was freaky.

607
00:36:08,169 --> 00:36:11,804
Look, um, I'm not supposed to tell
you what I'm gonna tell you.

608
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,606
Okay, fine. Don't.

609
00:36:13,641 --> 00:36:15,878
I just... I-I have to warn you.

610
00:36:17,278 --> 00:36:19,178
You could die if you don't
get clear of The Beast.

611
00:36:19,213 --> 00:36:20,913
You think I don't know
how dangerous he is?

612
00:36:20,948 --> 00:36:24,083
No, not him. Us.
We're going to kill him.

613
00:36:24,118 --> 00:36:26,485
Do what you want with him
but not until I get Reynard.

614
00:36:26,521 --> 00:36:28,994
No, we can't wait.

615
00:36:29,323 --> 00:36:31,557
- You won't...
- No, Jules, we can't.

616
00:36:31,592 --> 00:36:33,859
I-I know that you're hurting. I just...

617
00:36:33,895 --> 00:36:36,662
I-I need you to see
that this is bigger than you.

618
00:36:36,697 --> 00:36:38,731
The Beast,
he's killing magic everywhere.

619
00:36:38,766 --> 00:36:40,402
And Reynard is killing
people everywhere.

620
00:36:40,427 --> 00:36:41,685
Do you think that that's less important?

621
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:44,838
No, I just think that what
you want here is revenge and...

622
00:36:44,863 --> 00:36:46,624
And you don't?

623
00:36:49,054 --> 00:36:52,355
Just don't be within
20 feet of The Beast

624
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,879
when we make our move, okay?

625
00:36:53,904 --> 00:36:57,843
Do it before I get Reynard,
you better not be within 20 miles of me.

626
00:37:00,721 --> 00:37:02,698
I came here to warn you
and you're threatening me.

627
00:37:07,728 --> 00:37:10,144
Look, I did what I had to do. I...

628
00:37:10,298 --> 00:37:12,363
make up your own mind.

629
00:37:13,133 --> 00:37:15,348
There's something.

630
00:37:16,293 --> 00:37:19,471
About the castle.
He... he made some kind of joke.

631
00:37:19,507 --> 00:37:21,040
He put a curse on it.

632
00:37:21,075 --> 00:37:22,918
Anyone who assumes the throne.

633
00:37:23,077 --> 00:37:25,156
What kind of curse?

634
00:37:25,947 --> 00:37:27,726
He wouldn't say.

635
00:37:27,982 --> 00:37:29,523
But I'm pretty sure it's no joke.

636
00:37:29,617 --> 00:37:31,585
Okay, vague.

637
00:37:32,486 --> 00:37:34,407
Mildly helpful, I guess.

638
00:37:34,655 --> 00:37:36,641
It's all I got.

639
00:37:37,959 --> 00:37:39,633
Thank you.

640
00:37:41,796 --> 00:37:43,629
Sure.

641
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,598
This is...

642
00:37:48,169 --> 00:37:50,102
I know.

643
00:37:52,206 --> 00:37:55,140
Okay, I'll see you when I see you.

644
00:37:58,879 --> 00:38:00,452
See you.

645
00:38:55,251 --> 00:38:57,485
Wow.

646
00:38:58,666 --> 00:39:00,228
I owe you for real.

647
00:39:11,089 --> 00:39:14,932
Good. Now this is going
to take just a few minutes

648
00:39:14,957 --> 00:39:16,423
to fully power up.

649
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:18,537
You all are going to need
something strong

650
00:39:18,694 --> 00:39:20,467
to hold off The Beast.

651
00:39:20,696 --> 00:39:22,577
Step one...

652
00:39:22,831 --> 00:39:25,092
is for all of you

653
00:39:25,117 --> 00:39:29,330
to get very, very drunk.

654
00:39:29,638 --> 00:39:32,036
- Why?
- You'll see.

655
00:39:32,207 --> 00:39:34,348
Chug-a-lug.

656
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:38,011
As you grow, your name will become
an important part of you.

657
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:41,415
Even the shape of the letters
will connect with your will,

658
00:39:41,532 --> 00:39:43,499
your unique abilities.

659
00:39:47,923 --> 00:39:51,017
Well, I can never get buried
in a Jewish cemetery.

660
00:39:51,226 --> 00:39:55,187
- Are you even Jewish?
- No, but options.

661
00:39:55,212 --> 00:39:58,080
How much do I have to drink
so that I never have to hear

662
00:39:58,105 --> 00:40:00,233
- your voice again?
- Good.

663
00:40:00,258 --> 00:40:02,425
Now for the painful part.

664
00:40:02,471 --> 00:40:04,214
That wasn't the painful part?

665
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:07,350
Oh, no. Professor Li?

666
00:40:28,662 --> 00:40:31,460
This is a Cacodemon.

667
00:40:31,866 --> 00:40:33,733
- Jesus.
- They'll grow much bigger.

668
00:40:33,819 --> 00:40:37,270
Unleash these and believe me,
they'll keep The Beast plenty busy.

669
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:41,429
Each of you will be given a special word
to command your Cacodemon to attack.

670
00:40:41,652 --> 00:40:43,618
They're a one-shot weapon,

671
00:40:43,643 --> 00:40:45,476
so pick your moment with care.

672
00:40:45,647 --> 00:40:48,435
What are you, uh, gonna do with it?

673
00:40:49,117 --> 00:40:51,885
Lift your shirt, Quentin,
and turn around.

674
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,286
Oh.

675
00:40:53,428 --> 00:40:55,756
Those words never led to anything good.

676
00:40:55,924 --> 00:40:58,272
Well, almost never.

677
00:41:13,401 --> 00:41:15,368
Right, next.

678
00:41:20,249 --> 00:41:23,560
Sire, it's working.

679
00:41:23,683 --> 00:41:25,404
Oh, great.

680
00:41:25,731 --> 00:41:28,732
- Mm, thank you.
- Thank you, my King.

681
00:41:29,291 --> 00:41:32,292
No, no. Thank the hell
that was my childhood.

682
00:41:37,432 --> 00:41:39,318
Oh, well,

683
00:41:39,501 --> 00:41:42,185
perfect timing, for once.

684
00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:51,516
Your High King has agricultural
tales to tell.

685
00:41:51,947 --> 00:41:54,812
I give you the reign of...

686
00:41:55,384 --> 00:41:57,002
King Shit.

687
00:42:01,288 --> 00:42:04,495

be dead without me, so...
