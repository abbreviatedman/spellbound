1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,069
<i>- Previously on
"The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:04,071 --> 00:00:05,537
- Hey, can you help me
find some information?

3
00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:07,373
- What are you looking for?

4
00:00:07,375 --> 00:00:09,475
- Well, say a... a being with
an enormous amount of power.

5
00:00:09,477 --> 00:00:13,045
I'm looking for how someone
might, you know, defeat them.

6
00:00:14,315 --> 00:00:15,748
- "The art of killing gods."

7
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,182
You weren't on the poison room?

8
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:18,350
- Believe me,
I wanna get in there.

9
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:19,785
It's... it's above my pay grade.

10
00:00:19,787 --> 00:00:21,353
- Penny, Silvia.

11
00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:23,155
- You really don't need my help?
- With what?

12
00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:24,790
- Trying to break into
the poison room.

13
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:27,593
- I am telling you the truth
because you are the one I trust,

14
00:00:27,595 --> 00:00:30,162
and I really just need
your support right now.

15
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:31,530
<i>- I controlled their minds.</i>

16
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,265
- Of course, honey.

17
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:35,434
<i>- Just like you have,
many, many times.</i>

18
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:37,403
<i>- They said they were
just trying to summon</i>

19
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:38,804
<i>a little help
from some kind of god.</i>

20
00:00:38,806 --> 00:00:41,040
- They were summoning
an evil bitch.

21
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:42,441
The benevolent
our lady underground.

22
00:00:42,443 --> 00:00:44,176
It is all about her.

23
00:00:44,178 --> 00:00:46,111
Grinding men men and gods
into the fucking dirt,

24
00:00:46,113 --> 00:00:47,246
and then she leaves!

25
00:00:47,248 --> 00:00:48,514
- That's miss Persephone.

26
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:50,115
- That's our lady underground.

27
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:52,251
- Julia, why do you look
like a 12-year-old?

28
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:53,485
- Because I'm her shade.

29
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:55,554
- Shades go to the underworld.

30
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:57,489
- Alice.
- Quentin.

31
00:00:57,491 --> 00:00:59,091
- I missed you so much.

32
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:01,226
- Is there any way
we can take her with us?

33
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:04,530
- Jules, what the hell?
- I know.

34
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:05,831
<i>This is my one shot,
and this is what</i>

35
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,099
<i>I want to do with it.</i>

36
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:12,404
- No one has ever brought
niffin back to life.

37
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,807
Many try, but all...

38
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:23,415
- We have something that
no one else has ever had.

39
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:25,484
We have Alice's shade.

40
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:28,087
The meta-math has never
added up before,

41
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:29,388
but with this...

42
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,125
- Still tremendously bad idea.

43
00:01:33,127 --> 00:01:34,560
- Fine, fuck him.

44
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:37,429
He won't help us.
We'll take it to Dean Fogg.

45
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:40,499
- With one morning fart,
I release more magic

46
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:43,102
than Henry Fogg has
in his whole life.

47
00:01:43,104 --> 00:01:44,470
- But you can't
get it up for this?

48
00:01:44,472 --> 00:01:47,473
- No, you can't.
- I won't.

49
00:01:47,475 --> 00:01:53,545
The energy we would need would
take a hundred master magicians.

50
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:00,452
- That's a battery.

51
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:03,589
That holds magical current.

52
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:05,390
That is the biggest one
that I've ever seen.

53
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:07,159
How many of those do you have?

54
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:08,327
- Not enough to spare.

55
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:10,362
Took years to make,
and I need it.

56
00:02:10,364 --> 00:02:11,697
- No.
- What's more important

57
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:13,198
than a life?

58
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,466
- You talk like life
means something.

59
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:15,868
- If it doesn't,
then what's the point?

60
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,469
This is what magic is for.

61
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:20,339
- Boldly spoken for a student
who lacked the balls

62
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:22,141
to control a flea.

63
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:25,711
- Look, I survived your abuse,
and I got off my ass,

64
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:27,346
and I went
into the goddamn world.

65
00:02:27,348 --> 00:02:28,380
What have you done?
You...

66
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:30,315
You've sat around and drank.

67
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,217
- Fuck you.
- No, fuck you.

68
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:34,353
Do you know why Alice
went to Brakebills?

69
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:35,888
To find out what happened
to her brother.

70
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:39,158
What happened was his friend
Emily had the bad sense

71
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,360
to fall in love with you,
and it destroyed her.

72
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:44,196
And when he tried to help,
it turned him into a niffin.

73
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:48,500
Now tell me that you hold
zero responsibility for that.

74
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:52,471
You can't erase any of that,
but you can help Alice.

75
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:54,540
You can help Alice now.

76
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:10,956
- You look worried.

77
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,559
- Just thinking about Alice.

78
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:16,228
She's gonna be
really pissed at me.

79
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,399
- Yeah, but when she has
her shade back, she'll get it.

80
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:22,367
Trust me.

81
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:26,538
Um... Speaking of shades,
since this is probably

82
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,273
the last time I'm going
to have one...

83
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:32,277
- Look, you do not
have to do this.

84
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:33,712
- Yes, I do.

85
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:37,349
You're a good friend,
better one than I deserve.

86
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:38,350
- Not true.

87
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:40,352
- Blah, blah, feelings bullshit.

88
00:03:40,354 --> 00:03:41,720
Let's begin.

89
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:45,657
First we separate shade,
which will pull niffin here.

90
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,326
- You memorize?
- Yeah.

91
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,695
- You can handle it?
- Yes.

92
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:37,609
- I'm going to fix you,
but I just have to lock you

93
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,045
in here for a minute, okay?

94
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:46,718
- Thank you.

95
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:52,557
- Julia, lock the cage.

96
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,417
- She's coming.

97
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:38,537
Quentin!

98
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:40,672
I'll burn you alive for this!

99
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,474
- When you're ready, Coldwater.

100
00:05:42,476 --> 00:05:43,476
- It's gonna be okay.

101
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:49,381
- Please, please,
Quentin, don't.

102
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,887
Hey.

103
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:33,925
I brought you some clothes
if you, um...

104
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,463
Okay.

105
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,540
Why don't I go
get you some food?

106
00:06:48,542 --> 00:06:50,876
You haven't eaten in, um...

107
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:57,883
Mayakovsky said to start
with really bland food,

108
00:06:57,885 --> 00:07:01,186
so I thought oatmeal.

109
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:03,655
- Why?

110
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:07,426
- Why bland food?
- Or why...

111
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:08,693
Why did I bring you back?

112
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:12,164
- Mm.

113
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,699
- I couldn't
leave you like that.

114
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:21,673
Alice.

115
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:25,844
- Fuck you.

116
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:33,485
<i>- So, the poison room.</i>

117
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:37,789
The code to the door
changes every couple hours.

118
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:40,192
The door itself
is warded, alarmed.

119
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:41,893
- And don't forget
booby-trapped.

120
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:44,930
So instead of going through
the magical dismemberment door,

121
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:47,766
let's go through the back way.

122
00:07:47,768 --> 00:07:50,669
That door isn't just a door.

123
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:52,571
It's a portal to another world.

124
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:55,006
That's where the poison room is.

125
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,675
- So if we find
the right fountain...?

126
00:07:56,677 --> 00:07:58,043
- We can walk right in.

127
00:07:58,045 --> 00:08:00,579
I heard a couple librarians
whispering about it.

128
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:03,682
The poison room fountain has
a stack of books for a statue.

129
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:05,951
If we split up,
we could probably find it

130
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:07,586
within a matter of weeks.

131
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:10,655
- Weeks?
- No, no, no, I got this.

132
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:11,690
Think hours.

133
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:12,724
- What makes you so cocky?

134
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,259
- 'Cause I'm a traveler.

135
00:08:14,261 --> 00:08:16,862
And, for once, it's not
totally fucking me.

136
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,505
- It is customary to bow in
the presence of your high king.

137
00:08:26,507 --> 00:08:30,008
- I... wh...
- How are you here?

138
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,878
- I think, and by that,
I mean I'm absolutely certain,

139
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,014
that I was banished.
Had to be.

140
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:40,519
So in the books, Ember and umber
before Martin offed him,

141
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,721
they did this to the Chatwins
all the time, right?

142
00:08:42,723 --> 00:08:47,692
- Mm-hmm, um, yeah.

143
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:50,996
When their adventure
was done, or...

144
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:52,564
- Or what, Q?

145
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:54,733
My pregnant wife
is locked up in fairy Gitmo.

146
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:56,535
I'm betrothed to a rat.

147
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:58,837
My pinot noir grapes
are nearly ripe.

148
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:04,643
My adventure's just begun, so
why else would Ember banish me?

149
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:07,045
Because I'm a fuck up.
That's it.

150
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:09,748
So the button.
Gimme.

151
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,051
- Uh, about that, um,
we kind of bargained it away

152
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:16,755
to a dragon in exchange
for tickets to the underworld.

153
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:20,292
- You gave our only means
of traveling to Fillory

154
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:22,894
to fucking Trogdor?

155
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,604
Oh.

156
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:42,180
- Both the high king and queen
have vanished,

157
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:43,815
leaving you the only
child of earth in Fillory.

158
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,817
- Oh, my god.

159
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,252
They were my ride home.

160
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,855
- Um, yes, also
it makes you high king.

161
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,827
You can go to the rainbow bridge
to be crowned.

162
00:10:00,866 --> 00:10:04,703
Meh, let's skip the ceremony.

163
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:06,838
- On to business, then.

164
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,640
Half the court are still rats.

165
00:10:08,642 --> 00:10:10,742
The talking beavers
are in revolt.

166
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:12,344
They're demanding
dental coverage.

167
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:14,145
- And the measly mountains,
they've disappeared.

168
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:16,615
Completely just...
Stop!

169
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:19,351
The thrones are cursed.

170
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:22,887
- Okay, is anything not fucked?

171
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:27,092
- Your high kingliness, perhaps
this is all too much for you.

172
00:10:27,094 --> 00:10:30,195
- There was a great king
on earth who had a philosophy:

173
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:32,197
"Hakuna matata."

174
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:35,100
Roughly translated,
it means, "no worries."

175
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:36,801
That's my philosophy too.

176
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,070
Who gives a shit
about a few measly mountains?

177
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:40,772
- But...
- Erase them.

178
00:10:40,774 --> 00:10:43,108
Bring in the talking rats
to translate for the rat people,

179
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,677
and we are giving
all those beavers braces

180
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:48,113
because they deserve it.

181
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:49,714
Say it, tick.

182
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:54,219
- Hakuna matata.

183
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:55,501
- That's what I'm talking about.

184
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:10,161
- I'm sorry.

185
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:11,996
I got my shade back.

186
00:12:11,998 --> 00:12:15,467
And then I lost it
again for good,

187
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:19,237
but I also discovered
that I don't have to be

188
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,371
like the beast.

189
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:21,973
With the right help,
I can do good.

190
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:23,475
I just have a chip missing.

191
00:12:23,477 --> 00:12:26,177
- What do you want
from me, Julia?

192
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,446
- To be the missing chip.

193
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:30,482
Tell me when
to tap on the brakes.

194
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:32,751
- Tap?

195
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:35,253
- Slam on them.

196
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,255
I trust you.

197
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:40,358
I need you.

198
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,895
Shit.

199
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:49,434
Okay, we can try it.

200
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:54,339
The thing is, I think I kind of
need you too right now.

201
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:57,008
There's something
you need to know.

202
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,810
- Does Reynard
know that you're here?

203
00:12:58,812 --> 00:12:59,811
- No.

204
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:01,012
- Okay, that's good.

205
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:02,480
It's important that
we keep up appearances.

206
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:03,848
- I know.
- I've seen what he can do

207
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:04,983
when he's angry.

208
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:09,254
- John,
tell her what you told me

209
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:11,556
about our lady underground.

210
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:13,424
- Reynard's obsessed with her.

211
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:15,260
I think they were lovers,
but she left him.

212
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:18,229
Everything that he's done
to her followers, to you...

213
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,365
- it's not random.

214
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:23,968
- It's to get back at her.
- Yeah.

215
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,437
- Holy shit.

216
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,914
- Persephone is
our lady underground.

217
00:13:35,916 --> 00:13:38,082
- I saw her icons
when I was down there.

218
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:40,952
Maybe we can use her
to lure Reynard.

219
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:42,587
- Didn't you just say
that she disappeared?

220
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:44,389
- Well, we just need
to make Reynard believe

221
00:13:44,391 --> 00:13:45,990
that it's her.

222
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,892
If he thinks that she's here,
he'll come.

223
00:13:47,894 --> 00:13:49,394
- Well, okay, and then?

224
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:51,429
We still don't have a weapon.

225
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:52,530
- We have him.

226
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:54,599
- What do you...?
- No, no, no,

227
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:56,868
we are not killing you
for your power, John.

228
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:58,336
- That's insane.
- Agreed.

229
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,504
Off the table.

230
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:02,273
What we are gonna do
is teach you magic.

231
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:03,508
- I'm not a magician.

232
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,010
- No, you're more,

233
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,912
which is why it should be
easy for you to learn.

234
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:11,883
I mean, we don't have the juice
to take Reynard on, but you do.

235
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:17,088
- Can you tell me again
what the dragon said?

236
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:20,892
- You know Mayakovsky banned me
from seeing Alice for 48 hours?

237
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:23,027
He said that I am upsetting her.

238
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,562
- Well, he's not exactly wrong.

239
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:26,030
- Trying to help.

240
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,333
- You did.
- Now maybe you can help

241
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:30,034
- by letting it run its course.
- What if she...?

242
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:34,505
- Q, the greatest magician
on earth is watching her.

243
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:36,975
I know Mayakovsky can be
a massive asshole,

244
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:41,446
but he's not gonna actually
let anything happen to her,

245
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:46,417
not after what it cost him
to bring her back.

246
00:14:46,419 --> 00:14:48,987
All right, let's do that.

247
00:14:55,996 --> 00:15:00,098
I know it's hard right now,
but it's gonna be okay.

248
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,933
I think.

249
00:15:01,935 --> 00:15:03,935
Now will you please tell me
what puff the magic dragon

250
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:06,938
said to you?

251
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:11,009
- "The first portal
is still open."

252
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:15,446
I thought that might mean
Stonehenge.

253
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:19,017
The kids go there in book three.

254
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:21,152
- How many times
was that portal open?

255
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:22,587
- Once.

256
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:26,024
It's always
some new, unexpected...

257
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:31,062
Except the first one
that they used.

258
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:34,065
- They went back and forth
through that clock

259
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:35,433
all summer, right?

260
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,368
- Mm-hmm.
- Until their mother died

261
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,071
and their uncle
sold all their stuff.

262
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:43,975
- Um, I think I saw it.

263
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:46,511
<i>At my Yale interview.</i>

264
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:51,015
It was the same one
as the one on the cover.

265
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:55,954
I mean, the guy died.
They... they probably sold it off,

266
00:15:55,956 --> 00:15:59,624
but what if, um,
what if the clock I saw

267
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:02,060
was<i> the</i> clock?

268
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:09,701
- Why the fuck are you taking
a nap instead of looking for me?

269
00:16:09,703 --> 00:16:12,170
- Margo?

270
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:14,005
I-I thought you were banished.

271
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:17,108
- No, dumb-ass, I'm stuck
in the fairy realm.

272
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:20,411
How can I see you?

273
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:23,514
- Oh, shit, she must've
mixed in the wrong strain.

274
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,149
We wanted
"bang like happy pandas,"

275
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,118
not "see other worlds."

276
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,454
Never let an amateur
pack your bong, okay?

277
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:32,256
- Listen, dipshit,
you have to find Rafe,

278
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:34,625
the squirrely little prick
who works for the sloth.

279
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:37,628
He got me here.
He can get me back.

280
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,629
- You could say "please."

281
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:40,565
- No, I literally could not.

282
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:42,033
I'm gonna go find fen.

283
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:45,136
You find a goddamn way
to get me back.

284
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:47,105
- Okay.

285
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:48,106
- Pretty sure this is it.

286
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:49,574
- Book statue.

287
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:51,476
Not the most imaginative,
those librarians.

288
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:53,711
- Yeah, but not stupid.
- Look at this cover.

289
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:57,648
And locked.

290
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,784
I've never seen
anything like this.

291
00:16:59,786 --> 00:17:03,755
- Six-stage vermel
anti-tampering enchantment.

292
00:17:03,757 --> 00:17:05,556
I can crack it.

293
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:17,802
- Pretty varsity...

294
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:19,570
For a kid.

295
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:21,239
- My dad's a good teacher.

296
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:23,541
- All right,
so who pissed him off?

297
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,643
You're going to a lot of trouble
to get at some of the most

298
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:27,745
powerful battle magic
in the universe.

299
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:29,614
Somebody's about to
have a bad day.

300
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:31,215
- I know it's hard for men
to imagine women

301
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:33,551
having their own reasons
for doing anything,

302
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:36,154
but I'm looking for my own book.

303
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:38,756
I've been hidden away
in a library for the last year.

304
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:41,659
No TV, no Wi-Fi,
had to find some way

305
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:45,329
to entertain myself, so
I started reading Kanye's book.

306
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:47,598
By the way,
he's really misunderstood.

307
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
Anyway, right in the middle
of a sex scene,

308
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:51,235
the book just stopped.

309
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,770
- Kanye dies during sex?

310
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:54,172
- That's the weird part.

311
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:57,175
There were 20 more pages,
all blank.

312
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:58,776
It's a glitch, right?

313
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:02,180
But then, every other book
I checked of somebody alive

314
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:05,316
right now
ends in 20 blank pages.

315
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,821
The order's known about it
for years... they call it

316
00:18:09,823 --> 00:18:13,357
the great blank spot, some kind
of cataclysmic badness.

317
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,126
- Well, what causes it?

318
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:16,627
- They don't know,
just that it happens soon,

319
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:18,863
like, weeks.

320
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:24,635
- How is reading
your book gonna help?

321
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:26,370
- Something happens
that affects the library,

322
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:29,540
it'll be in a librarian's book,
but right now,

323
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:31,175
they're moving
all the librarians' books

324
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:33,611
to the poison room,
including mine.

325
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,813
The order thinks that
once your book is written,

326
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:37,248
your fate is sealed.

327
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,549
- Well, I've never seen
a book be wrong.

328
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:40,685
- You?
- No, but I saw them

329
00:18:40,687 --> 00:18:43,855
reshelve your book 39 times.

330
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:46,124
Time loops exist,
then I'm team Sarah Connor:

331
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:47,558
"No fate but what we make."

332
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,327
- Fine,
I'll grab your book for you.

333
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:50,795
- I can get it myself.

334
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,830
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
you're not coming.

335
00:18:52,832 --> 00:18:56,300
How are you gonna get back?
I can't travel anyone with me.

336
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,836
- Think this is my first time
fountain spelunking?

337
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:16,287
- Well, fountain didn't
drop us in a lava pit,

338
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:19,857
so we've got that going for us.

339
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:34,539
- When they named it
the poison room, how literal

340
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,674
do you think they were being?

341
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,876
- Let's just do this fast.

342
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:40,178
- Yeah.

343
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:46,918
- Coming in on the weekend.

344
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,187
Now, that is work ethic.

345
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,224
- I was hoping to run into you,
actually.

346
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:57,495
I, uh, have questions,
and I would appreciate

347
00:19:57,497 --> 00:20:02,266
some fatherly guidance.

348
00:20:02,268 --> 00:20:04,902
- I'd like that too.

349
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:07,805
Here.

350
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,641
It struck me that I've missed
a lot of birthdays.

351
00:20:10,643 --> 00:20:11,842
Open it.

352
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:20,351
N... what is...?

353
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:23,554
- You went back to the witches.

354
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:24,855
- Where is she?

355
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:26,824
Where's my wife?

356
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:30,995
- Oh, here and there.

357
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:33,664
I saved you the biggest piece.

358
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,939
Are you still trying
to be a good person?

359
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:44,275
As if there is such a thing.

360
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:48,980
Left alone, you would fight
and fight against your nature.

361
00:20:48,982 --> 00:20:52,350
And you would waste so much
of what you really are.

362
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:57,722
- If you think doing this
is going to turn me into you,

363
00:20:57,724 --> 00:21:00,691
you don't understand
people at all.

364
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:03,294
- I've been at it a long time.

365
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:05,663
Well, look at Julia.

366
00:21:05,665 --> 00:21:08,299
I put a tiny black spot
on her soul,

367
00:21:08,301 --> 00:21:12,637
and she scrubbed at it so much
she put a hole in it.

368
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:14,839
She can never go back
to who she is.

369
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:16,641
Now...

370
00:21:16,643 --> 00:21:18,643
Neither can you.

371
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,049
This is an investment

372
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:27,718
in our future, son.

373
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,353
Someday,

374
00:21:29,355 --> 00:21:34,358
when you've embraced
what you really are,

375
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,994
you'll come find me.

376
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:01,886
- Can I help you?

377
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:05,990
- Hi, we're looking for a clock.

378
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:08,359
It belonged to my grandfather.

379
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:11,896
- The auction website,
it listed this address.

380
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:13,631
- Auction websites
don't do that.

381
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:15,032
- Ugh, fine.

382
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:18,035
We bribed the webmaster.

383
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:20,705
The clock's got a lot
of sentimental value, so.

384
00:22:20,707 --> 00:22:22,773
- Sorry, there's no clock here.

385
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:26,777
- "The clock was an unremarkable
thing on its surface.

386
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:29,046
"To keep his mind off
the troubles of war and family,"

387
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:32,917
"Martin set out to repair
its inner workings,"

388
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:36,721
"and in place
of a mechanical heart..."

389
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:40,925
- "He found a new world."

390
00:22:40,927 --> 00:22:43,527
That's my favorite chapter
in the book.

391
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,999
- Holy shit,
there are two of you.

392
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:50,401
- Don't touch that.
- Oh.

393
00:22:50,403 --> 00:22:51,402
- Please, put that down.

394
00:22:51,404 --> 00:22:53,871
- Sorry, okay.

395
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:57,842
- Is that...?

396
00:22:57,844 --> 00:23:01,746
- A screenplay for the failed
1983 feature film adaptation.

397
00:23:01,748 --> 00:23:03,481
- There was a "Fillory" movie?

398
00:23:03,483 --> 00:23:05,816
- No, the studio wouldn't
pay for the talking bears,

399
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:08,085
so the director,
he quit in protest.

400
00:23:08,087 --> 00:23:10,855
Can I?

401
00:23:10,857 --> 00:23:12,790
- Yeah.

402
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:17,128
- Q, uh, I found Grampy's clock.

403
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,096
- Wait, they changed
the Chatwins...

404
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:20,798
- Skateboarding Americans.

405
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,433
I know, a travesty.

406
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:24,034
And they got Jane
completely wrong.

407
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:27,905
A girl that timid could never
grow up to be a watcherwoman.

408
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,708
- Okay, real talk, I'll give you
$1,000 for the clock.

409
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:31,942
- It's a collector's item.

410
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:34,011
- $20,000.
- It's not for sale.

411
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:38,983
- Wait, the books never said
who the watcherwoman is.

412
00:23:41,521 --> 00:23:45,523
- Well, it's...
- It's not hard to deduce.

413
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:48,025
Anyone who's always wearing
a hood is clearly

414
00:23:48,027 --> 00:23:51,462
a character you've met before.

415
00:23:51,464 --> 00:23:53,998
- You know, don't you?

416
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,769
That it's all real.
You... you've been to Fillory.

417
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:02,473
Been to Fillory.

418
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:04,475
- Even in Fillory
the watcherwoman's identity

419
00:24:04,477 --> 00:24:05,743
is a secret.
Who are you?

420
00:24:05,745 --> 00:24:08,045
- Oh, my god, Q.

421
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:10,881
He has horns.

422
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:13,050
Like Ember, like,
just like Ember.

423
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:14,885
- What?

424
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:17,021
- Oh.

425
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:24,128
- Holy shit.

426
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,129
Umber?

427
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:27,565
- In the flesh.

428
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:32,636
- Are they in the eye of...

429
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:33,704
What even is that?

430
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:35,606
- Lightning storm, huge.

431
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:39,109
Happened every time Persephone
ascended from the underworld.

432
00:24:39,111 --> 00:24:40,644
She used to come every spring.

433
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:44,482
Now, decades, no pattern,
no trace.

434
00:24:44,484 --> 00:24:47,852
Except these modern accounts
show four storms stretch across

435
00:24:47,854 --> 00:24:50,187
the entire swath
of Southern Europe,

436
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:53,724
and, smack in the center,
Murs, France.

437
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:57,628
- So we just need
to kick up a light storm,

438
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,597
- a few twisters.
- And Reynard will think

439
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:00,865
our lady is on earth.

440
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:02,533
He'll come running.

441
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:03,535
- Yeah.

442
00:25:07,273 --> 00:25:08,272
Are you okay?

443
00:25:08,274 --> 00:25:12,176
- I... I need a drink.

444
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:24,188
- How was spell practice?

445
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,524
- I can barely make a spark.
- I thought you said it'd be easy.

446
00:25:26,526 --> 00:25:28,192
- You know, no pressure
or anything...

447
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:31,095
- do you ever think about
where you'd be if he hadn't...

448
00:25:31,097 --> 00:25:33,297
- raped me?

449
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:38,202
No, I try to focus on who I was.

450
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:42,172
It's getting harder, though.

451
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:44,808
- Reynard thinks he broke you,
that there's no coming back

452
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,176
from what he did.

453
00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:48,546
Do you think that's true?

454
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:50,214
- I hope not.

455
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:55,219
- Well, whatever happens,
don't let him be right.

456
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:05,563
I think you should
go get some pizza.

457
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:07,831
- Okay.

458
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,574
- Food run.

459
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:20,711
Listen, I wish we had time
to talk this through,

460
00:26:20,713 --> 00:26:22,880
but ultimately,
I know you'd agree with me.

461
00:26:22,882 --> 00:26:25,316
- What are you talking about?

462
00:26:25,318 --> 00:26:27,918
Ahh, ahh, oh, my wards.

463
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,286
- I'm sorry.

464
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:32,590
- Why, why are you
doing this to me?

465
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:35,759
- After everything
Julia's been through,

466
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,194
I can't make her do this.

467
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:39,263
- Do what?

468
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:44,735
- This is very good.

469
00:26:44,737 --> 00:26:45,736
Tea?

470
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:49,707
- I don't have time.

471
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:52,209
- Ah, brilliant,
the shortcut there...

472
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:54,645
- I don't have time.

473
00:26:56,715 --> 00:27:00,184
I understood everything,
and now it's fading like a dream

474
00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:02,686
that you woke me from.

475
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:04,154
Why can't I do magic?

476
00:27:04,156 --> 00:27:05,823
- You're newborn again.

477
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:07,625
You must crawl then walk.

478
00:27:07,627 --> 00:27:08,959
- How long?

479
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:10,761
- What's the rush?

480
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:16,634
- I'm stuck in this...
- This oily, disgusting cage,

481
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:18,936
and I... I can't even fucking see.
I can't do anything.

482
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:20,838
- On the contrary,
you're finally in a position

483
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,407
- to do something interesting.
- Fuck you, what do you know?

484
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:28,646
- I know, as niffin, you care
about nothing but your own mind,

485
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:31,248
so congratulations,
a perfect life

486
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:35,786
with zero meaning.
Now as human...

487
00:27:35,788 --> 00:27:38,255
- humans are weak
pieces of shit.

488
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:51,435
- Do you know what magic is?

489
00:27:51,437 --> 00:27:54,672
Energy capable of making
this shithole world

490
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:58,375
one fractional speck
less unbearable

491
00:27:58,377 --> 00:28:02,446
because we shits
try so fucking hard,

492
00:28:02,448 --> 00:28:06,984
and that... that is not weakness.
Believe me.

493
00:28:06,986 --> 00:28:10,254
You don't like this world?
Good, you see its faults.

494
00:28:10,256 --> 00:28:15,759
It gives you focus and solitude
to actually fix it.

495
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:24,301
Adderall, to fortify you.

496
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:26,970
Makes you write like Tolstoy.

497
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:30,441
Don't make face.

498
00:28:30,443 --> 00:28:32,710
Drugs are fun.

499
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:44,922
- Hey, I wasn't sure
what kind you wanted,

500
00:28:44,924 --> 00:28:47,858
so, I don't know, I...

501
00:28:52,765 --> 00:28:54,498
Oh, my god.

502
00:28:58,437 --> 00:29:00,871
- He made... he made me.

503
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:02,372
- What?

504
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:05,042
- He made me do the ritual.

505
00:29:05,044 --> 00:29:07,377
Collect his... his power.

506
00:29:09,381 --> 00:29:10,914
Oh, my god.

507
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:16,320
- Hey, you get yourself
cleaned up,

508
00:29:16,322 --> 00:29:19,389
and I'll handle the rest, okay?

509
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:28,532
- There you are,
you son of a bitch.

510
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:30,067
Ah.

511
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,845
Sylvia, where are you?
Sylvia!

512
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:42,913
Sylvia, read it
when you get back.

513
00:29:42,915 --> 00:29:44,548
We gotta go.

514
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,518
- You betrayed Ember.

515
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,019
- Well, I wouldn't call it that.

516
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:50,554
I just had no choice.

517
00:29:50,556 --> 00:29:52,389
It was a matter of survival.

518
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:55,092
A condition of the agreement
I made with Martin Chatwin.

519
00:29:55,094 --> 00:29:56,994
He had Fillory
booby-trapped to the gills.

520
00:29:56,996 --> 00:29:58,562
He was about to fillet me.

521
00:29:58,564 --> 00:30:02,065
- So you faked your own death,
and you moved to Vancouver?

522
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:03,801
- Well, if I had to
leave Fillory,

523
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:05,803
Canada was the obvious
second choice.

524
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:10,007
What is it that
you enjoy about Fillory?

525
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:13,844
- Uh... It reminds me of a time

526
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:16,113
before I realized
how shitty being an adult is.

527
00:30:16,115 --> 00:30:17,848
- And there's opium in the air.

528
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:20,050
- And how do you feel
about turtles?

529
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:21,819
- Indifferent, I guess.

530
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:23,387
- Not a fan.

531
00:30:23,389 --> 00:30:25,823
- Would you sleep easier
knowing that your entire world

532
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:28,392
rested on the back
of one or several?

533
00:30:28,394 --> 00:30:30,527
- What... why are you asking?

534
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:33,096
- Because as visitors
to my previous work,

535
00:30:33,098 --> 00:30:37,601
you make for an excellent
focus group for my new world.

536
00:30:37,603 --> 00:30:40,571
It's something
I've been building.

537
00:30:40,573 --> 00:30:42,472
Testing a few things out.

538
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:45,442
It's more of a pocket world,
really.

539
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:49,613
I call it Cuba.

540
00:30:49,615 --> 00:30:51,048
- That's already a place.

541
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,416
- Is it?
- Yes.

542
00:30:52,418 --> 00:30:53,984
- You're sure?
- Absolutely sure.

543
00:30:53,986 --> 00:30:57,054
- Oh, damn it.

544
00:30:57,056 --> 00:30:59,857
- Look, this is all
very interesting-ish,

545
00:30:59,859 --> 00:31:02,059
but I have a kingdom to fix.

546
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,435
You were never
meant to fix Fillory.

547
00:31:11,437 --> 00:31:12,536
- Of course I was.

548
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:13,904
- No, you were meant
to entertain

549
00:31:13,906 --> 00:31:16,573
like some reality TV star.

550
00:31:16,575 --> 00:31:19,243
Oh, Ember must've
found you so boring.

551
00:31:19,245 --> 00:31:21,111
- Boring?

552
00:31:21,113 --> 00:31:25,482
- Fillory was created out of
the unification of opposites.

553
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:28,886
Ember is a creature
of entropy and chaos...

554
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:31,622
- and you have every season
of "law & order" on DVD.

555
00:31:31,624 --> 00:31:35,092
- The most perfect show
in creation.

556
00:31:35,094 --> 00:31:38,195
When Ember and I were together,
there was balance.

557
00:31:38,197 --> 00:31:40,264
Without me, chaos reigns.

558
00:31:40,266 --> 00:31:42,432
Give up, children of earth.

559
00:31:42,434 --> 00:31:44,501
Fillory cannot be ruled.

560
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:54,478
- Whoa.

561
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,146
Come on.

562
00:31:56,148 --> 00:31:58,048
- Stop worrying about me.
- Fucking travel out already.

563
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,683
- Look, I will carry
your ass back by...

564
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:01,652
- you don't get it!

565
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:06,456
I don't make it
back to the rope.

566
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:08,225
My book didn't have
a blank spot.

567
00:32:08,227 --> 00:32:10,060
- So what?

568
00:32:10,062 --> 00:32:11,929
What happened to "there's
no fate but what we make"?

569
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:14,564
- If you carry me back,
you die too, penny.

570
00:32:14,566 --> 00:32:16,166
I read it.

571
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:19,202
Leaving me is the only way
you have a chance.

572
00:32:29,213 --> 00:32:30,681
- Penny.
- I got your book.

573
00:32:30,683 --> 00:32:32,249
- What the hell?

574
00:32:32,251 --> 00:32:33,684
Penny?
Oh, my...

575
00:32:33,686 --> 00:32:35,652
Help!

576
00:32:35,654 --> 00:32:37,554
- Give me good news, Rafe.

577
00:32:37,556 --> 00:32:40,090
- Unfortunately, returning
from the fairy realm

578
00:32:40,092 --> 00:32:42,526
is, uh, problematic.

579
00:32:42,528 --> 00:32:46,096
All I have is this tincture
that takes you there.

580
00:32:46,098 --> 00:32:47,631
- Why would I drink this?

581
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:49,499
Then I'm stuck there
with Margo, and you can't

582
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:50,968
get either of us out.

583
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,636
- Prince Ess of Loria,
your majesty.

584
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:54,237
- Where's my father?

585
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:56,540
- Hey, I don't think
we've formally met.

586
00:32:56,542 --> 00:32:58,041
- Cut the shit.

587
00:32:58,043 --> 00:33:00,110
I will tear this place apart
if I have to.

588
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:05,983
- So uh, funny story, uh,
your... your dad is actually

589
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:07,317
a rat person now.

590
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:09,619
- Do it.
- He's...

591
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:25,002
- break it down.

592
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:28,405
- Hakuna matata has failed me.

593
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:35,479
- It pains me, but I simply
cannot go back to Fillory.

594
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:39,583
- So you're just gonna let Ember
turn Fillory into a telenovela?

595
00:33:39,585 --> 00:33:42,019
- Well, you don't understand
how he is.

596
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:44,121
He pitted animals
against each other

597
00:33:44,123 --> 00:33:47,224
by offering only the sexiest
the ability to speak.

598
00:33:47,226 --> 00:33:50,027
Centaurs?
Drunk off his chair, obviously.

599
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:53,230
When he gets snacky, he talks
about turning humans into rats.

600
00:33:53,232 --> 00:33:56,033
- Holy shit.

601
00:33:56,035 --> 00:33:57,667
Ember turned everybody
into rats.

602
00:33:57,669 --> 00:33:59,236
- Oh, he finally did it.

603
00:33:59,238 --> 00:34:01,238
That's been on his bucket list
for centuries.

604
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,507
- Ember cock-blocked me.

605
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:06,643
- You are a god of Fillory.

606
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:08,745
Why are you just sitting here
and letting your brother

607
00:34:08,747 --> 00:34:10,147
shit all over it?

608
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:11,782
You let the beast happen.

609
00:34:11,784 --> 00:34:15,318
You shut out a child
who needed shelter,

610
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:19,089
and when he became a monster,
you ran.

611
00:34:19,091 --> 00:34:21,258
You hate chaos?

612
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:25,328
Then fix the chaos
that you created.

613
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,202
- You're right.

614
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:35,172
But some mistakes
cannot be repaired.

615
00:34:35,174 --> 00:34:37,641
And from those,
we must move forward.

616
00:34:37,643 --> 00:34:39,676
And I shall try
to avoid repeating

617
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:42,846
such mistakes in my new world.

618
00:34:42,848 --> 00:34:44,748
- Fine...

619
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:48,151
Then give us the clock.

620
00:34:48,153 --> 00:34:50,387
- Why do you care?

621
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:52,622
Fillory's on its last legs.

622
00:34:52,624 --> 00:34:55,692
Everything you've said tells me
Ember is tired of the game.

623
00:34:55,694 --> 00:34:58,161
He's likely to smash the place
like a toddler.

624
00:34:58,163 --> 00:35:01,198
Trust me, that'll be it.
End of Fillory.

625
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,833
And don't get sentimental.

626
00:35:02,835 --> 00:35:04,367
- We aren't ready
to walk away yet.

627
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:06,670
We know you still love Fillory.

628
00:35:06,672 --> 00:35:10,740
You literally have
every memento to prove it.

629
00:35:10,742 --> 00:35:12,375
If you can't fix it
or won't save it,

630
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:16,179
then let us try.

631
00:35:16,181 --> 00:35:18,248
Please.

632
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:21,751
- You love Fillory.

633
00:35:21,753 --> 00:35:23,887
- It's my home.

634
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:30,160
- Then the clock is yours,
your majesty.

635
00:35:30,162 --> 00:35:33,363
But heed my warning.

636
00:35:33,365 --> 00:35:38,368
Nothing entertains Ember more
than a whimsical death.

637
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,660
- Hey.
- Hey.

638
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:07,230
How's penny?
Still alive?

639
00:36:07,232 --> 00:36:09,766
I could've worded that better.

640
00:36:09,768 --> 00:36:13,270
- Yeah.

641
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:15,839
They cleared out
the whole infirmary.

642
00:36:15,841 --> 00:36:17,874
Something about radiation.

643
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:19,309
- That can't be good.

644
00:36:19,311 --> 00:36:20,911
- And not much I can do about it
right now.

645
00:36:20,913 --> 00:36:23,213
- So you've got time.

646
00:36:23,215 --> 00:36:26,283
Kill it with me killing Reynard.

647
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:29,252
Good news,
found a spell in here.

648
00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:32,722
Turns metal objects
into god-piercing weapons.

649
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:37,260
And if it can
be anything, gun, right?

650
00:36:37,262 --> 00:36:41,865
But it took everything John
gave us just to make one bullet.

651
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:45,302
- So we've got one shot.

652
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,283
- Fall back.

653
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:03,720
Don't inhale the... Smoke...

654
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:24,241
- oh, shit.

655
00:37:24,243 --> 00:37:26,977
Luckily, I'm a pro.
Come on, come on.

656
00:37:29,982 --> 00:37:31,314
Fen?

657
00:37:31,316 --> 00:37:33,783
- Josh, you can see me?
- Fen!

658
00:37:33,785 --> 00:37:36,753
- Josh, help me!
- Help me, please, hurry!

659
00:37:39,891 --> 00:37:43,426
- Tick, tell my story.

660
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:05,949
- Well, this is it.

661
00:38:07,352 --> 00:38:09,486
- The sign Reynard's
been waiting for.

662
00:38:09,488 --> 00:38:11,888
Come on out, asshole.

663
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:16,926
Something feels so right about
tricking him with goddess omens.

664
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:18,028
- Amen.

665
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,362
Let's get scarce.

666
00:38:19,364 --> 00:38:20,930
Let's go.

667
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:37,981
- I know you're here.

668
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:39,883
- There he is.

669
00:38:39,885 --> 00:38:42,886
- The lightning, the wind...

670
00:38:42,888 --> 00:38:45,889
Always were a drama queen.

671
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:49,926
- I can't get a clear shot.

672
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,599
- Go on the other side.

673
00:38:56,601 --> 00:38:59,436
- I'll get you a clear shot.
- Kady!

674
00:38:59,438 --> 00:39:00,937
- Hey!

675
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:04,474
- I should have known.

676
00:39:04,476 --> 00:39:05,909
Where's Julia?

677
00:39:05,911 --> 00:39:08,978
- Why don't you ask me
where John is?

678
00:39:10,948 --> 00:39:12,849
- What did you do?

679
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,984
- Nothing he wasn't asking for.

680
00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:17,620
Hated you so much,
he begged me to kill him.

681
00:39:17,622 --> 00:39:19,022
- You bitch!

682
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:20,024
You liar!

683
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:34,137
- Kady, what...?

684
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:54,591
- It's you.

685
00:39:54,593 --> 00:39:58,828
You ignored us,
and now you're here?

686
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,564
All of a sudden?

687
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,700
Why?

688
00:40:03,702 --> 00:40:07,103
- To ask you to spare his life.

689
00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:08,571
- I don't understand.

690
00:40:08,573 --> 00:40:11,474
Why do you care?

691
00:40:11,476 --> 00:40:13,676
- He's my son.

692
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,550
- Did you know
what he was doing?

693
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:26,589
Of course you did.

694
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:28,758
He raped me.

695
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,860
Your son.

696
00:40:30,862 --> 00:40:34,731
I'd be sobbing
and telling you every detail,

697
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:36,733
but I lost my shade
in the abortion,

698
00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:40,870
so you're just gonna have to
take my word for it.

699
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:42,705
- Let me deal with him.

700
00:40:42,707 --> 00:40:44,874
- Why would I trust you?
- Come the fuck on, lady.

701
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:47,510
- There are consequences
to killing a god, Julia.

702
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:50,580
- I lost my friends.
- I lost everything.

703
00:40:50,582 --> 00:40:54,150
He turned me into a monster.

704
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:56,719
- You're a survivor.

705
00:40:59,558 --> 00:41:01,925
You're still capable of mercy,
Julia.

706
00:41:01,927 --> 00:41:05,562
Don't let him rob you of that.

707
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,773
It's your choice.

708
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:47,904
- I am so disappointed
with what you've done.

709
00:41:47,906 --> 00:41:51,841
- You left me.
<i>- You</i> left me.

710
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:54,978
- Well, I am back.

711
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,881
And it's time to go.

712
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:02,051
- No, no!

713
00:42:02,053 --> 00:42:07,056
How could you do this after
everything we've been through?

714
00:42:07,058 --> 00:42:09,692
I killed John for this.

715
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:10,894
- It was the right thing.

716
00:42:10,896 --> 00:42:13,963
- How the hell
would you know that?

717
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:16,933
- Sorry, Kady.

718
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:44,060
- Our lady sent me.

719
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:06,816
- Hey, I'm sorry I hurt you.

720
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:13,957
I tried to do the right thing.

721
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:19,729
But I'm not sorry
that you're alive,

722
00:43:19,731 --> 00:43:22,365
and maybe that makes me selfish,
but I...

723
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:27,670
The world's a better place
when you're in it.

724
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,676
Say the word, and I'll stay.

725
00:43:36,615 --> 00:43:39,015
If you want me to leave you
alone for a while

726
00:43:39,017 --> 00:43:41,784
and figure this out on your own,
I mean, let's face it.

727
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:43,853
There's probably nothing
that you can't figure out.

728
00:43:43,855 --> 00:43:46,656
You are Alice Quinn.

729
00:43:56,667 --> 00:44:00,169
- Okay, so the plan so far is,

730
00:44:00,171 --> 00:44:02,872
find a way to stay in Fillory

731
00:44:02,874 --> 00:44:04,941
and never get banished again.

732
00:44:04,943 --> 00:44:08,845
Find a way to stop Ember or
drive him out or, I don't know,

733
00:44:08,847 --> 00:44:11,948
anything but letting him
get so bored he decides

734
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:14,717
to just shake the etch a sketch
and end our kingdom,

735
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,886
everyone I care about, and
the well spring in the process.

736
00:44:16,888 --> 00:44:19,889
So, thoughts?

737
00:44:19,891 --> 00:44:22,959
- You're talking about
conquering Fillory.

738
00:44:22,961 --> 00:44:24,761
- For its own good.

739
00:44:24,763 --> 00:44:29,065
- Your plan is the exact same
as the beast's was.

740
00:44:29,067 --> 00:44:31,000
- Shit.

741
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:37,807
Do you got a better idea?
