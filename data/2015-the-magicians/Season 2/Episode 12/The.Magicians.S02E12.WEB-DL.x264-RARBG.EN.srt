1
00:00:00,991 --> 00:00:02,313
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:02,438 --> 00:00:04,535
Hey, can you help me
find some information?

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,505
What are you looking for?

4
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:09,235
Well, say a... a being with
an enormous amount of power.

5
00:00:09,355 --> 00:00:12,723
I'm looking for how someone
might, you know, defeat them.

6
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:15,859
"The art of killing gods."

7
00:00:15,928 --> 00:00:17,127
Any word on the Poison Room?

8
00:00:17,195 --> 00:00:18,328
Believe me, I wanna get in there.

9
00:00:18,397 --> 00:00:19,896
It's... it's above my pay grade.

10
00:00:19,965 --> 00:00:21,331
Penny, Silvia.

11
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,099
- You really don't need my help?
- With what?

12
00:00:23,168 --> 00:00:24,734
Trying to break into the Poison Room.

13
00:00:24,803 --> 00:00:27,671
I am telling you the truth
because you are the one I trust,

14
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:30,140
and I really just need
your support right now.

15
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,808
I controlled their minds.

16
00:00:31,877 --> 00:00:33,276
Of course, honey.

17
00:00:33,345 --> 00:00:35,478
Just like you have, many, many times.

18
00:00:35,547 --> 00:00:37,447
They said they were
just trying to summon

19
00:00:37,516 --> 00:00:38,748
a little help from some kind of god.

20
00:00:38,817 --> 00:00:40,784
They were summoning an evil bitch.

21
00:00:40,852 --> 00:00:42,686
The benevolent Our Lady Underground.

22
00:00:42,754 --> 00:00:43,954
It is all about her.

23
00:00:44,022 --> 00:00:46,056
Grinding men men and gods
into the fucking dirt,

24
00:00:46,124 --> 00:00:47,223
and then she leaves!

25
00:00:47,292 --> 00:00:48,558
That's Miss Persephone.

26
00:00:48,627 --> 00:00:50,093
That's Our Lady Underground.

27
00:00:50,162 --> 00:00:52,262
Julia, why do you look
like a 12-year-old?

28
00:00:52,331 --> 00:00:53,530
Because I'm her shade.

29
00:00:53,598 --> 00:00:55,832
Shades go to the underworld.

30
00:00:55,901 --> 00:00:57,767
- Alice.
- Quentin.

31
00:00:57,836 --> 00:00:58,868
I missed you so much.

32
00:00:58,937 --> 00:01:01,237
Is there any way
we can take her with us?

33
00:01:03,241 --> 00:01:04,574
- Jules, what the hell?
- I know.

34
00:01:04,643 --> 00:01:05,942
This is my one shot, and this is what

35
00:01:06,011 --> 00:01:07,110
I want to do with it.

36
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:12,382
No one has ever brought
niffin back to life.

37
00:01:12,451 --> 00:01:14,918
Many try, but all...

38
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:23,426
We have something that
no one else has ever had.

39
00:01:23,495 --> 00:01:25,495
We have Alice's shade.

40
00:01:25,564 --> 00:01:27,998
The meta-math has never added up before,

41
00:01:28,066 --> 00:01:29,466
but with this...

42
00:01:31,269 --> 00:01:33,069
Still tremendously bad idea.

43
00:01:33,138 --> 00:01:34,637
Fine, fuck him.

44
00:01:34,706 --> 00:01:37,440
He won't help us.
We'll take it to Dean Fogg.

45
00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:40,543
With one morning fart,
I release more magic

46
00:01:40,612 --> 00:01:43,046
than Henry Fogg has in his whole life.

47
00:01:43,115 --> 00:01:44,514
But you can't get it up for this?

48
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:47,517
No, you can't. I won't.

49
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:49,888
The energy we would need

50
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:53,607
would take a hundred Master Magicians.

51
00:01:58,864 --> 00:02:00,497
That's a battery.

52
00:02:00,565 --> 00:02:03,566
That holds magical current.

53
00:02:03,635 --> 00:02:05,368
That is the biggest one
that I've ever seen.

54
00:02:05,437 --> 00:02:07,070
How many of those do you have?

55
00:02:07,139 --> 00:02:08,304
Not enough to spare.

56
00:02:08,373 --> 00:02:10,340
Took years to make, and I need it.

57
00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:11,941
- No.
- What's more important

58
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,109
than a life?

59
00:02:13,178 --> 00:02:14,477
You talk like life means something.

60
00:02:14,546 --> 00:02:15,986
If it doesn't, then what's the point?

61
00:02:16,048 --> 00:02:17,447
This is what magic is for.

62
00:02:17,516 --> 00:02:20,316
Boldly spoken for a student
who lacked the balls

63
00:02:20,385 --> 00:02:21,851
to control a flea.

64
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,955
Look, I survived your abuse,
and I got off my ass,

65
00:02:26,024 --> 00:02:27,290
and I went into the goddamn world.

66
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:28,359
What have you done? You...

67
00:02:28,427 --> 00:02:30,260
you've sat around and drank.

68
00:02:30,328 --> 00:02:32,162
- Fuck you.
- No, fuck you.

69
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,297
Do you know why Alice
went to Brakebills?

70
00:02:34,366 --> 00:02:35,799
To find out what happened
to her brother.

71
00:02:35,867 --> 00:02:38,902
What happened was his friend
Emily had the bad sense

72
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,371
to fall in love with you,
and it destroyed her.

73
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,940
And when he tried to help,
it turned him into a niffin.

74
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:48,545
Now tell me that you hold
zero responsibility for that.

75
00:02:48,613 --> 00:02:52,482
You can't erase any of that,
but you can help Alice.

76
00:02:52,551 --> 00:02:54,651
You can help Alice now.

77
00:03:08,433 --> 00:03:11,067
You look worried.

78
00:03:11,136 --> 00:03:13,570
Just thinking about Alice.

79
00:03:13,638 --> 00:03:15,939
She's gonna be really pissed at me.

80
00:03:16,007 --> 00:03:20,577
Yeah, but when she has
her Shade back, she'll get it.

81
00:03:20,645 --> 00:03:22,312
Trust me.

82
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,549
Um... speaking of Shades,
since this is probably

83
00:03:26,618 --> 00:03:28,218
the last time I'm going to have one...

84
00:03:28,286 --> 00:03:32,188
Look, you do not have to do this.

85
00:03:32,257 --> 00:03:33,756
Yes, I do.

86
00:03:33,825 --> 00:03:37,293
You're a good friend,
better one than I deserve.

87
00:03:37,362 --> 00:03:38,294
Not true.

88
00:03:38,363 --> 00:03:40,296
Blah, blah, feelings bullshit.

89
00:03:40,365 --> 00:03:41,764
Let's begin.

90
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:45,902
First we separate Shade,
which will pull niffin here.

91
00:03:45,971 --> 00:03:47,303
- You memorize?
- Yeah.

92
00:03:47,372 --> 00:03:49,973
- You can handle it?
- Yes.

93
00:04:33,785 --> 00:04:37,587
I'm going to fix you,
but I just have to lock you

94
00:04:37,656 --> 00:04:40,156
in here for a minute, okay?

95
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,930
Thank you.

96
00:04:49,935 --> 00:04:52,769
Julia, lock the cage.

97
00:05:17,195 --> 00:05:18,328
She's coming.

98
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:38,514
Quentin!

99
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,650
I'll burn you alive for this!

100
00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:42,418
When you're ready, Coldwater.

101
00:05:42,487 --> 00:05:43,419
It's gonna be okay.

102
00:05:47,626 --> 00:05:49,292
Please, please, Quentin, don't.

103
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:25,038

104
00:06:27,398 --> 00:06:29,165
Hey.

105
00:06:31,035 --> 00:06:34,270
I brought you some clothes if you, um...

106
00:06:36,641 --> 00:06:38,674
Okay.

107
00:06:47,252 --> 00:06:48,684
Why don't I go get you some food?

108
00:06:48,753 --> 00:06:51,187
You haven't eaten in, um...

109
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:58,294
Mayakovsky said to start
with really bland food,

110
00:06:58,363 --> 00:07:01,497
so I thought oatmeal.

111
00:07:01,566 --> 00:07:03,799
Why?

112
00:07:03,868 --> 00:07:07,503
Why bland food? Or why...

113
00:07:07,572 --> 00:07:09,038
Why did I bring you back?

114
00:07:09,107 --> 00:07:12,241
Mm.

115
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,944
I couldn't leave you like that.

116
00:07:20,084 --> 00:07:21,884
Alice.

117
00:07:24,088 --> 00:07:26,122
Fuck you.

118
00:07:31,429 --> 00:07:33,362
So, the Poison Room.

119
00:07:33,431 --> 00:07:37,967
The code to the door
changes every couple hours.

120
00:07:38,036 --> 00:07:40,503
The door itself is warded, alarmed.

121
00:07:40,572 --> 00:07:42,104
And don't forget booby-trapped.

122
00:07:42,173 --> 00:07:45,174
So instead of going through
the magical dismemberment door,

123
00:07:45,243 --> 00:07:47,944
let's go through the back way.

124
00:07:48,012 --> 00:07:50,846
That door isn't just a door.

125
00:07:50,915 --> 00:07:52,715
It's a portal to another world.

126
00:07:52,784 --> 00:07:55,251
That's where the Poison Room is.

127
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,819
So if we find the right fountain...?

128
00:07:56,888 --> 00:07:58,287
We can walk right in.

129
00:07:58,356 --> 00:08:00,523
I heard a couple librarians
whispering about it.

130
00:08:00,592 --> 00:08:03,759
The Poison Room fountain has
a stack of books for a statue.

131
00:08:03,828 --> 00:08:06,329
If we split up,
we could probably find it

132
00:08:06,397 --> 00:08:07,663
within a matter of weeks.

133
00:08:07,732 --> 00:08:10,766
Weeks? No, no, no, I got this.

134
00:08:10,835 --> 00:08:11,835
Think hours.

135
00:08:11,869 --> 00:08:12,909
What makes you so cocky?

136
00:08:12,937 --> 00:08:14,337
'Cause I'm a traveler.

137
00:08:14,405 --> 00:08:17,106
And, for once, it's not
totally fucking me.

138
00:08:23,214 --> 00:08:26,582
It is customary to bow in
the presence of your High King.

139
00:08:26,651 --> 00:08:30,219
I...wh... How are you here?

140
00:08:30,288 --> 00:08:33,055
I think, and by that,
I mean I'm absolutely certain,

141
00:08:33,124 --> 00:08:36,225
that I was banished. Had to be.

142
00:08:36,294 --> 00:08:40,396
So in the books, Ember and Umber
before Martin offed him,

143
00:08:40,465 --> 00:08:42,832
they did this to the Chatwins
all the time, right?

144
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:47,837
Mm-hmm, um, yeah.

145
00:08:47,905 --> 00:08:51,407
When their adventure was done, or...

146
00:08:51,476 --> 00:08:52,675
Or what, Q?

147
00:08:52,744 --> 00:08:54,877
My pregnant wife
is locked up in Fairy Gitmo.

148
00:08:54,946 --> 00:08:56,646
I'm betrothed to a rat.

149
00:08:56,714 --> 00:08:59,015
My Pinot noir grapes are nearly ripe.

150
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:04,720
My adventure's just begun, so
why else would Ember banish me?

151
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:07,423
Because I'm a fuck up. That's it.

152
00:09:07,492 --> 00:09:09,859
So the button. Gimme.

153
00:09:09,927 --> 00:09:13,229
Uh, about that, um,
we kind of bargained it away

154
00:09:13,297 --> 00:09:16,866
to a dragon in exchange
for tickets to the Underworld.

155
00:09:16,934 --> 00:09:20,569
You gave our only means
of traveling to Fillory

156
00:09:20,638 --> 00:09:23,272
to fucking Trogdor?

157
00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:32,682
Oh.

158
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,392
Both the high king and queen
have vanished

159
00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:43,666
leaving you the only
Child of Earth in Fillory.

160
00:09:43,786 --> 00:09:45,107
Oh, my God.

161
00:09:46,212 --> 00:09:47,503
They were my ride home.

162
00:09:47,623 --> 00:09:51,311
Um, yes, also it makes you High King.

163
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:56,416
You can go to the Rainbow Bridge
to be crowned.

164
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,861
Meh, let's skip the ceremony.

165
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,030
On to business, then.

166
00:10:07,099 --> 00:10:08,565
Half the court are still rats.

167
00:10:08,634 --> 00:10:10,701
The talking beavers are in revolt.

168
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:12,269
They're demanding dental coverage.

169
00:10:12,338 --> 00:10:14,218
And the Measly Mountains,
they've disappeared.

170
00:10:14,273 --> 00:10:16,540
Completely just... Stop!

171
00:10:16,608 --> 00:10:19,476
The thrones are cursed.

172
00:10:19,545 --> 00:10:22,913
Okay, is anything not fucked?

173
00:10:22,982 --> 00:10:26,984
Your High Kingliness, perhaps
this is all too much for you.

174
00:10:27,052 --> 00:10:30,287
There was a great king
on Earth who had a philosophy:

175
00:10:30,356 --> 00:10:32,322
"Hakuna matata."

176
00:10:32,391 --> 00:10:35,192
Roughly translated,
it means, "no worries."

177
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,793
That's my philosophy too.

178
00:10:36,862 --> 00:10:39,162
Who gives a shit
about a few Measly Mountains?

179
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,764
- But...
- Erase them.

180
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:43,000
Bring in the talking rats
to translate for the rat people,

181
00:10:43,068 --> 00:10:45,869
and we are giving
all those beavers braces

182
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:48,205
because they deserve it.

183
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,773
Say it, Tick.

184
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,311
Hakuna matata.

185
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,580
That's what I'm talking about.

186
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:10,220
I'm sorry.

187
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:12,189
I got my Shade back.

188
00:12:12,257 --> 00:12:15,592
And then I lost it again for good,

189
00:12:15,661 --> 00:12:19,296
but I also discovered
that I don't have to be

190
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:20,464
like The Beast.

191
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:22,165
With the right help, I can do good.

192
00:12:22,234 --> 00:12:23,600
I just have a chip missing.

193
00:12:23,669 --> 00:12:26,236
What do you want from me, Julia?

194
00:12:26,305 --> 00:12:28,538
To be the missing chip.

195
00:12:28,607 --> 00:12:30,807
Tell me when to tap on the brakes.

196
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:32,876
Tap?

197
00:12:32,945 --> 00:12:35,345
Slam on them.

198
00:12:35,414 --> 00:12:37,347
I trust you.

199
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:40,484
I need you.

200
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:43,987
Shit.

201
00:12:46,091 --> 00:12:49,359
Okay, we can try it.

202
00:12:49,428 --> 00:12:54,431
The thing is, I think I kind of
need you too right now.

203
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,033
There's something you need to know.

204
00:12:57,102 --> 00:12:58,969
Does Reynard know that you're here?

205
00:12:59,037 --> 00:12:59,769
No.

206
00:12:59,838 --> 00:13:01,037
Okay, that's good.

207
00:13:01,106 --> 00:13:02,572
It's important that
we keep up appearances.

208
00:13:02,641 --> 00:13:03,974
I know. I've seen what he can do

209
00:13:04,042 --> 00:13:04,941
when he's angry.

210
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:09,312
John, tell her what you told me

211
00:13:09,381 --> 00:13:11,681
about Our Lady Underground.

212
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,517
Reynard's obsessed with her.

213
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,118
I think they were lovers,
but she left him.

214
00:13:15,187 --> 00:13:18,288
Everything that he's done
to her followers, to you...

215
00:13:18,357 --> 00:13:20,423
It's not random.

216
00:13:20,492 --> 00:13:24,127
- It's to get back at her.
- Yeah.

217
00:13:24,196 --> 00:13:26,630
Holy shit.

218
00:13:33,138 --> 00:13:35,872
Persephone is Our lady Underground.

219
00:13:35,941 --> 00:13:38,074
I saw her icons when I was down there.

220
00:13:38,143 --> 00:13:40,911
Maybe we can use her to lure Reynard.

221
00:13:40,979 --> 00:13:42,746
Didn't you just say
that she disappeared?

222
00:13:42,814 --> 00:13:44,534
Well, we just need
to make Reynard believe

223
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,016
that it's her.

224
00:13:46,084 --> 00:13:48,084
If he thinks that she's here,
he'll come.

225
00:13:48,153 --> 00:13:49,519
Well, okay, and then?

226
00:13:49,588 --> 00:13:51,555
We still don't have a weapon.

227
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:52,689
We have him.

228
00:13:52,758 --> 00:13:54,758
- What do you...?
- No, no, no,

229
00:13:54,826 --> 00:13:56,860
we are not killing you
for your power, John.

230
00:13:56,929 --> 00:13:58,428
- That's insane.
- Agreed.

231
00:13:58,497 --> 00:13:59,629
Off the table.

232
00:13:59,698 --> 00:14:02,299
What we are gonna do is teach you magic.

233
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:03,567
I'm not a Magician.

234
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,969
No, you're more,

235
00:14:06,038 --> 00:14:07,837
which is why it should be
easy for you to learn.

236
00:14:07,906 --> 00:14:11,875
I mean, we don't have the juice
to take Reynard on, but you do.

237
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:17,080
Can you tell me again
what the dragon said?

238
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:20,817
You know Mayakovsky banned me
from seeing Alice for 48 hours?

239
00:14:20,886 --> 00:14:23,019
He said that I am upsetting her.

240
00:14:23,088 --> 00:14:24,688
Well, he's not exactly wrong.

241
00:14:24,756 --> 00:14:26,022
Trying to help.

242
00:14:26,091 --> 00:14:28,191
You did. Now maybe you can help

243
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,993
- by letting it run its course.
- What if she...?

244
00:14:30,062 --> 00:14:34,598
Q, the greatest Magician
on Earth is watching her.

245
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,933
I know Mayakovsky can be
a massive asshole,

246
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:41,538
but he's not gonna actually
let anything happen to her,

247
00:14:41,607 --> 00:14:46,476
not after what it cost him
to bring her back.

248
00:14:46,545 --> 00:14:49,012
All right, let's do that.

249
00:14:56,054 --> 00:15:00,323
I know it's hard right now,
but it's gonna be okay.

250
00:15:00,392 --> 00:15:01,825
I think.

251
00:15:01,893 --> 00:15:04,027
Now will you please tell me
what Puff the Magic Dragon

252
00:15:04,096 --> 00:15:06,830
said to you?

253
00:15:06,898 --> 00:15:11,001
"The first portal is still open."

254
00:15:12,838 --> 00:15:15,472
I thought that might mean Stonehenge.

255
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,942
The kids go there in Book Three.

256
00:15:19,011 --> 00:15:21,344
How many times was that portal open?

257
00:15:21,413 --> 00:15:22,679
Once.

258
00:15:22,748 --> 00:15:26,082
It's always some new, unexpected...

259
00:15:27,653 --> 00:15:31,021
Except the first one that they used.

260
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:34,224
They went back and forth
through that clock

261
00:15:34,293 --> 00:15:35,293
all summer, right?

262
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,427
- Mm-hmm.
- Until their mother died

263
00:15:37,496 --> 00:15:40,230
and their uncle sold all their stuff.

264
00:15:40,299 --> 00:15:43,933
Um, I think I saw it.

265
00:15:44,002 --> 00:15:46,603
At my Yale interview.

266
00:15:46,672 --> 00:15:50,974
It was the same one
as the one on the cover.

267
00:15:51,043 --> 00:15:55,912
I mean, the guy died.
They... they probably sold it off,

268
00:15:55,981 --> 00:15:59,749
but what if, um, what if the clock I saw

269
00:15:59,818 --> 00:16:02,085
was the clock?

270
00:16:05,691 --> 00:16:09,993
Why the ...ck are you taking
a nap instead of looking for me?

271
00:16:10,062 --> 00:16:12,329
Margo?

272
00:16:12,397 --> 00:16:13,930
I-I thought you were banished.

273
00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:17,233
No, dumbass, I'm stuck
in the Fairy Realm.

274
00:16:17,302 --> 00:16:20,236
How can I see you?

275
00:16:20,305 --> 00:16:23,540
Oh, shit, she must've
mixed in the wrong strain.

276
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:25,308
We wanted "bang like happy pandas,"

277
00:16:25,377 --> 00:16:27,043
not "see other worlds."

278
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:29,312
Never let an amateur
pack your bong, okay?

279
00:16:29,381 --> 00:16:32,248
Listen, dipshit, you have to find Rafe,

280
00:16:32,317 --> 00:16:34,718
the squirrely little prick
who works for the sloth.

281
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:37,721
He got me here. He can get me back.

282
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:38,722
You could say "please."

283
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,657
No, I literally could not.

284
00:16:40,726 --> 00:16:41,991
I'm gonna go find Fen.

285
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,295
You find a goddamn way to get me back.

286
00:16:45,364 --> 00:16:47,063
Okay.

287
00:16:47,132 --> 00:16:48,264
Pretty sure this is it.

288
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,466
Book statue.

289
00:16:49,534 --> 00:16:51,334
Not the most imaginative,
those librarians.

290
00:16:51,403 --> 00:16:53,903
Yeah, but not stupid.
Look at this cover.

291
00:16:56,441 --> 00:16:57,741
And locked.

292
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,909
I've never seen anything like this.

293
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:04,047
Six-stage Vermel
anti-tampering enchantment.

294
00:17:04,116 --> 00:17:05,682
I can crack it.

295
00:17:16,461 --> 00:17:18,094
Pretty varsity...

296
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:19,596
For a kid.

297
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,197
My dad's a good teacher.

298
00:17:21,266 --> 00:17:23,366
All right, so who pissed him off?

299
00:17:23,435 --> 00:17:25,702
You're going to a lot of trouble
to get at some of the most

300
00:17:25,771 --> 00:17:27,804
powerful battle magic in the universe.

301
00:17:27,873 --> 00:17:29,472
Somebody's about to have a bad day.

302
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,174
I know it's hard for men
to imagine women

303
00:17:31,243 --> 00:17:33,576
having their own reasons
for doing anything,

304
00:17:33,645 --> 00:17:36,112
but I'm looking for my own book.

305
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:38,848
I've been hidden away
in a library for the last year.

306
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:41,551
No TV, no Wi-Fi, had to find some way

307
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:45,321
to entertain myself, so
I started reading Kanye's book.

308
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,457
By the way, he's really misunderstood.

309
00:17:47,526 --> 00:17:49,659
Anyway, right in the middle
of a sex scene,

310
00:17:49,728 --> 00:17:51,394
the book just stopped.

311
00:17:51,463 --> 00:17:52,862
Kanye dies during sex?

312
00:17:52,931 --> 00:17:54,130
That's the weird part.

313
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:57,133
There were 20 more pages, all blank.

314
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:58,701
It's a glitch, right?

315
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,071
But then, every other book
I checked of somebody alive

316
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,442
right now ends in 20 blank pages.

317
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,913
The Order's known about it
for years... they call it

318
00:18:09,981 --> 00:18:13,516
the Great Blank Spot, some kind
of cataclysmic badness.

319
00:18:13,585 --> 00:18:15,018
Well, what causes it?

320
00:18:15,086 --> 00:18:16,653
They don't know,
just that it happens soon,

321
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:19,155
like, weeks.

322
00:18:23,028 --> 00:18:24,461
How is reading your book gonna help?

323
00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:26,329
Something happens
that affects the library,

324
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:29,365
it'll be in a librarian's book,
but right now,

325
00:18:29,434 --> 00:18:31,100
they're moving all the librarians' books

326
00:18:31,169 --> 00:18:33,436
to the Poison Room, including mine.

327
00:18:33,505 --> 00:18:35,872
The Order thinks that
once your book is written,

328
00:18:35,941 --> 00:18:37,173
your fate is sealed.

329
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:38,575
Well, I've never seen a book be wrong.

330
00:18:38,643 --> 00:18:40,777
- You?
- No, but I saw them

331
00:18:40,846 --> 00:18:43,980
reshelve your book 39 times.

332
00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:46,049
Time loops exist,
then I'm team Sarah Connor:

333
00:18:46,117 --> 00:18:47,417
"No fate but what we make."

334
00:18:47,486 --> 00:18:49,519
Fine, I'll grab your book for you.

335
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:50,887
I can get it myself.

336
00:18:50,956 --> 00:18:52,755
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you're not coming.

337
00:18:52,824 --> 00:18:56,259
How are you gonna get back?
I can't travel anyone with me.

338
00:18:56,328 --> 00:18:59,128
Think this is my first time
fountain spelunking?

339
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:16,512
Well, fountain didn't
drop us in a lava pit,

340
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:20,208
so we've got that going for us.

341
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:34,630
When they named it
the Poison Room, how literal

342
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:36,799
do you think they were being?

343
00:19:36,835 --> 00:19:39,268
Let's just do this fast.

344
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:40,304
Yeah.

345
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,343
Coming in on the weekend.

346
00:19:47,378 --> 00:19:49,312
Now, that is work ethic.

347
00:19:50,482 --> 00:19:53,282
I was hoping to run into you, actually.

348
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:57,620
I, uh, have questions,
and I would appreciate

349
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:02,525
some fatherly guidance.

350
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,294
I'd like that too.

351
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,797
Here.

352
00:20:07,832 --> 00:20:10,800
It struck me that I've missed
a lot of birthdays.

353
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,135
Open it.

354
00:20:18,376 --> 00:20:20,643
N...what is...?

355
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:23,713
You went back to the witches.

356
00:20:23,748 --> 00:20:25,081
Where is she?

357
00:20:25,116 --> 00:20:27,049
Where's my wife?

358
00:20:27,085 --> 00:20:31,254
Oh, here and there.

359
00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:33,856
I saved you the biggest piece.

360
00:20:40,331 --> 00:20:42,165
Are you still trying
to be a good person?

361
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,333
As if there is such a thing.

362
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:49,238
Left alone, you would fight
and fight against your nature.

363
00:20:49,274 --> 00:20:52,441
And you would waste so much
of what you really are.

364
00:20:52,477 --> 00:20:57,947
If you think doing this
is going to turn me into you,

365
00:20:57,982 --> 00:21:00,883
you don't understand people at all.

366
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:03,519
I've been at it a long time.

367
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:05,788
Well, look at Julia.

368
00:21:05,823 --> 00:21:08,357
I put a tiny black spot on her soul,

369
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:12,762
and she scrubbed at it so much
she put a hole in it.

370
00:21:12,797 --> 00:21:15,231
She can never go back to who she is.

371
00:21:15,266 --> 00:21:16,766
Now...

372
00:21:16,801 --> 00:21:18,768
neither can you.

373
00:21:21,105 --> 00:21:25,474
This is an investment

374
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,910
in our future, son.

375
00:21:27,946 --> 00:21:29,445
Someday,

376
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:34,650
when you've embraced
what you really are,

377
00:21:34,686 --> 00:21:37,453
you'll come find me.

378
00:22:00,211 --> 00:22:02,078
Can I help you?

379
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:06,182
Hi, we're looking for a clock.

380
00:22:06,217 --> 00:22:08,384
It belonged to my grandfather.

381
00:22:08,419 --> 00:22:12,054
The auction website,
it listed this address.

382
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,756
Auction websites don't do that.

383
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,224
Ugh, fine.

384
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,227
We bribed the webmaster.

385
00:22:18,263 --> 00:22:20,830
The clock's got a lot
of sentimental value, so.

386
00:22:20,865 --> 00:22:22,732
Sorry, there's no clock here.

387
00:22:22,767 --> 00:22:26,736
"The clock was an unremarkable
thing on its surface.

388
00:22:26,771 --> 00:22:29,272
"To keep his mind off
the troubles of war and family,

389
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:33,075
"Martin set out to repair
its inner workings,

390
00:22:33,111 --> 00:22:36,912
"and in place of a mechanical heart..."

391
00:22:37,949 --> 00:22:41,150
"He found a new world."

392
00:22:41,185 --> 00:22:43,719
That's my favorite chapter in the book.

393
00:22:47,458 --> 00:22:49,225
Holy shit, there are two of you.

394
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,660
- Don't touch that.
- Oh.

395
00:22:50,695 --> 00:22:51,661
Please, put that down.

396
00:22:51,696 --> 00:22:54,163
Sorry, okay.

397
00:22:56,067 --> 00:22:57,833
Is that...?

398
00:22:57,869 --> 00:23:01,837
A screenplay for the failed
1983 feature film adaptation.

399
00:23:01,873 --> 00:23:03,506
There was a "Fillory" movie?

400
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:05,941
No, the studio wouldn't
pay for the talking bears,

401
00:23:05,977 --> 00:23:08,511
so the director, he quit in protest.

402
00:23:08,546 --> 00:23:11,013
Can I?

403
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:12,915
Yeah.

404
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:17,353
Q, uh, I found Grampy's clock.

405
00:23:17,388 --> 00:23:19,322
Wait, they changed the Chatwins...

406
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:20,923
Skateboarding Americans.

407
00:23:20,958 --> 00:23:22,491
I know, a travesty.

408
00:23:22,527 --> 00:23:24,226
And they got Jane completely wrong.

409
00:23:24,262 --> 00:23:27,863
A girl that timid could never
grow up to be a Watcherwoman.

410
00:23:27,899 --> 00:23:30,833
Okay, real talk, I'll give you
$1,000 for the clock.

411
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:32,101
It's a collector's item.

412
00:23:32,136 --> 00:23:34,203
- $20,000.
- It's not for sale.

413
00:23:34,238 --> 00:23:39,175
Wait, the books never said
who the Watcherwoman is.

414
00:23:41,646 --> 00:23:45,614
Well, it's... it's not hard to deduce.

415
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:48,250
Anyone who's always wearing
a hood is clearly

416
00:23:48,286 --> 00:23:51,754
a character you've met before.

417
00:23:51,789 --> 00:23:54,023
You know, don't you?

418
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:58,928
That it's all real.
You... you've been to Fillory.

419
00:24:00,832 --> 00:24:02,498
Been to Fillory.

420
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:04,667
Even in Fillory
the Watcherwoman's identity

421
00:24:04,702 --> 00:24:05,835
is a secret. Who are you?

422
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,404
Oh, my God, Q.

423
00:24:08,439 --> 00:24:10,973
He has horns.

424
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:13,442
Like Ember, like, just like Ember.

425
00:24:13,478 --> 00:24:15,044
What?

426
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:17,213
Oh.

427
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:24,520
Holy shit.

428
00:24:24,555 --> 00:24:25,521
Umber?

429
00:24:25,556 --> 00:24:27,723
In the flesh.

430
00:24:30,041 --> 00:24:32,041
Are they in the eye of...

431
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:33,974
What even is that?

432
00:24:34,042 --> 00:24:35,442
Lightning storm, huge.

433
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:39,279
Happened every time Persephone
ascended from the Underworld.

434
00:24:39,347 --> 00:24:40,713
She used to come every spring.

435
00:24:40,782 --> 00:24:44,284
Now, decades, no pattern, no trace.

436
00:24:44,352 --> 00:24:47,987
Except these modern accounts
show four storms stretch across

437
00:24:48,056 --> 00:24:50,423
the entire swath of Southern Europe,

438
00:24:50,492 --> 00:24:53,927
and, smack in the center, Murs, France.

439
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,730
So we just need
to kick up a light storm,

440
00:24:57,799 --> 00:24:59,666
- a few twisters.
- And Reynard will think

441
00:24:59,734 --> 00:25:01,134
Our Lady is on Earth.

442
00:25:01,203 --> 00:25:02,735
He'll come running.

443
00:25:02,804 --> 00:25:03,736
Yeah.

444
00:25:07,509 --> 00:25:08,441
Are you okay?

445
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:12,345
I...I need a drink.

446
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:24,157
How was spell practice?

447
00:25:24,226 --> 00:25:26,559
I can barely make a spark.
I thought you said it'd be easy.

448
00:25:26,628 --> 00:25:28,161
You know, no pressure or anything...

449
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:31,264
Do you ever think about
where you'd be if he hadn't...

450
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:33,600
Raped me?

451
00:25:34,603 --> 00:25:38,404
No, I try to focus on who I was.

452
00:25:38,473 --> 00:25:42,142
It's getting harder, though.

453
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:45,111
Reynard thinks he broke you,
that there's no coming back

454
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,346
from what he did.

455
00:25:46,414 --> 00:25:48,548
Do you think that's true?

456
00:25:48,617 --> 00:25:50,216
I hope not.

457
00:25:50,285 --> 00:25:55,455
Well, whatever happens,
don't let him be right.

458
00:26:01,463 --> 00:26:05,732
I think you should go get some pizza.

459
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,101
Okay.

460
00:26:15,177 --> 00:26:16,576
Food run.

461
00:26:16,645 --> 00:26:20,747
Listen, I wish we had time
to talk this through,

462
00:26:20,815 --> 00:26:23,149
but ultimately,
I know you'd agree with me.

463
00:26:23,218 --> 00:26:25,518
What are you talking about?

464
00:26:25,587 --> 00:26:28,221
Ahh, ahh, oh, my wards.

465
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,489
I'm sorry.

466
00:26:29,558 --> 00:26:32,625
Why, why are you doing this to me?

467
00:26:32,694 --> 00:26:35,828
After everything Julia's been through,

468
00:26:35,897 --> 00:26:37,363
I can't make her do this.

469
00:26:37,432 --> 00:26:39,532
Do what?

470
00:26:41,703 --> 00:26:45,004
This is very good.

471
00:26:45,073 --> 00:26:45,805
Tea?

472
00:26:45,874 --> 00:26:49,742
I don't have time.

473
00:26:49,811 --> 00:26:52,378
Ah, brilliant, the shortcut there...

474
00:26:52,447 --> 00:26:54,747
I don't have time.

475
00:26:56,751 --> 00:27:00,386
I understood everything,
and now it's fading like a dream

476
00:27:00,455 --> 00:27:02,689
that you woke me from.

477
00:27:02,757 --> 00:27:04,290
Why can't I do magic?

478
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:05,858
You're newborn again.

479
00:27:05,927 --> 00:27:07,827
You must crawl then walk.

480
00:27:07,896 --> 00:27:09,229
How long?

481
00:27:09,297 --> 00:27:10,863
What's the rush?

482
00:27:12,267 --> 00:27:16,436
I'm stuck in this...
this oily, disgusting cage,

483
00:27:16,504 --> 00:27:19,005
and I... I can't even fucking see.
I can't do anything.

484
00:27:19,074 --> 00:27:20,914
On the contrary,
you're finally in a position

485
00:27:20,942 --> 00:27:23,376
- to do something interesting.
- Fuck you, what do you know?

486
00:27:23,445 --> 00:27:28,615
I know, as niffin, you care
about nothing but your own mind,

487
00:27:28,683 --> 00:27:31,384
so congratulations, a perfect life

488
00:27:31,453 --> 00:27:35,822
with zero meaning. Now as human...

489
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:38,491
Humans are weak pieces of shit.

490
00:27:47,936 --> 00:27:51,638
Do you know what magic is?

491
00:27:51,706 --> 00:27:54,674
Energy capable of making
this shithole world

492
00:27:54,743 --> 00:27:58,578
one fractional speck less unbearable

493
00:27:58,647 --> 00:28:02,582
because we shits try so fucking hard,

494
00:28:02,651 --> 00:28:07,053
and that... that is not weakness.
Believe me.

495
00:28:07,122 --> 00:28:10,189
You don't like this world?
Good, you see its faults.

496
00:28:10,258 --> 00:28:15,862
It gives you focus and solitude
to actually fix it.

497
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:24,437
Adderall, to fortify you.

498
00:28:24,506 --> 00:28:27,206
Makes you write like Tolstoy.

499
00:28:27,275 --> 00:28:30,610
Don't make face.

500
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:32,779
Drugs are fun.

501
00:28:42,891 --> 00:28:44,991
Hey, I wasn't sure what kind you wanted,

502
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,994
so, I don't know, I...

503
00:28:53,068 --> 00:28:54,701
Oh, my God.

504
00:28:58,707 --> 00:29:01,074
He made... he made me.

505
00:29:01,142 --> 00:29:02,475
What?

506
00:29:02,544 --> 00:29:05,278
He made me do the ritual.

507
00:29:05,347 --> 00:29:07,480
Collect his... his power.

508
00:29:09,551 --> 00:29:10,983
Oh, my God.

509
00:29:12,721 --> 00:29:16,456
Hey, you get yourself cleaned up,

510
00:29:16,524 --> 00:29:19,625
and I'll handle the rest, okay?

511
00:29:26,668 --> 00:29:28,901
There you are, you son of a bitch.

512
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,203
Ah.

513
00:29:39,981 --> 00:29:41,848
Sylvia, where are you? Sylvia!

514
00:29:41,916 --> 00:29:43,116
Sylvia, read it when you get back.

515
00:29:43,184 --> 00:29:44,817
We gotta go.

516
00:29:46,621 --> 00:29:47,720
You betrayed Ember.

517
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:49,288
Well, I wouldn't call it that.

518
00:29:49,357 --> 00:29:50,757
I just had no choice.

519
00:29:50,825 --> 00:29:52,358
It was a matter of survival.

520
00:29:52,427 --> 00:29:55,194
A condition of the agreement
I made with Martin Chatwin.

521
00:29:55,263 --> 00:29:57,063
He had Fillory
booby-trapped to the gills.

522
00:29:57,132 --> 00:29:58,564
He was about to fillet me.

523
00:29:58,633 --> 00:30:02,135
So you faked your own death,
and you moved to Vancouver?

524
00:30:02,203 --> 00:30:03,803
Well, if I had to leave Fillory,

525
00:30:03,872 --> 00:30:05,805
Canada was the obvious second choice.

526
00:30:05,874 --> 00:30:10,076
What is it that you enjoy about Fillory?

527
00:30:10,145 --> 00:30:13,880
Uh... it reminds me of a time

528
00:30:13,948 --> 00:30:16,416
before I realized
how shitty being an adult is.

529
00:30:16,484 --> 00:30:17,884
And there's opium in the air.

530
00:30:17,952 --> 00:30:20,353
And how do you feel about turtles?

531
00:30:20,422 --> 00:30:22,088
Indifferent, I guess.

532
00:30:22,157 --> 00:30:23,389
Not a fan.

533
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:25,858
Would you sleep easier
knowing that your entire world

534
00:30:25,927 --> 00:30:28,594
rested on the back of one or several?

535
00:30:28,663 --> 00:30:30,763
What... why are you asking?

536
00:30:30,832 --> 00:30:33,232
Because as visitors to my previous work,

537
00:30:33,301 --> 00:30:37,837
you make for an excellent
focus group for my new world.

538
00:30:37,906 --> 00:30:40,807
It's something I've been building.

539
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:42,475
Testing a few things out.

540
00:30:42,544 --> 00:30:45,711
It's more of a pocket world, really.

541
00:30:47,415 --> 00:30:49,849
I call it Cuba.

542
00:30:49,918 --> 00:30:51,350
That's already a place.

543
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:52,452
- Is it?
- Yes.

544
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,320
- You're sure?
- Absolutely sure.

545
00:30:54,389 --> 00:30:57,190
Oh, damn it.

546
00:30:57,258 --> 00:30:59,959
Look, this is all very interesting-ish,

547
00:31:00,028 --> 00:31:02,328
but I have a kingdom to fix.

548
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,604
You were never meant to fix Fillory.

549
00:31:11,673 --> 00:31:12,705
Of course I was.

550
00:31:12,774 --> 00:31:13,974
No, you were meant to entertain

551
00:31:14,008 --> 00:31:16,776
like some reality TV star.

552
00:31:16,845 --> 00:31:19,545
Oh, Ember must've found you so boring.

553
00:31:19,614 --> 00:31:21,180
Boring?

554
00:31:21,249 --> 00:31:25,485
Fillory was created out of
the unification of opposites.

555
00:31:25,553 --> 00:31:28,955
Ember is a creature
of entropy and chaos...

556
00:31:29,023 --> 00:31:31,858
And you have every season
of "Law & Order" on DVD.

557
00:31:31,926 --> 00:31:35,194
The most perfect show in creation.

558
00:31:35,263 --> 00:31:38,531
When Ember and I were together,
there was balance.

559
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,600
Without me, chaos reigns.

560
00:31:40,668 --> 00:31:42,635
Give up, Children of Earth.

561
00:31:42,704 --> 00:31:44,704
Fillory cannot be ruled.

562
00:31:53,648 --> 00:31:54,680
Whoa.

563
00:31:54,749 --> 00:31:56,249
Come on.

564
00:31:56,317 --> 00:31:58,117
Stop worrying about me.
Fucking travel out already.

565
00:31:58,186 --> 00:31:59,952
Look, I will carry your ass back by...

566
00:32:00,021 --> 00:32:01,921
You don't get it!

567
00:32:03,024 --> 00:32:06,425
I don't make it back to the rope.

568
00:32:06,494 --> 00:32:08,528
My book didn't have a blank spot.

569
00:32:08,596 --> 00:32:10,129
So what?

570
00:32:10,198 --> 00:32:11,931
What happened to "there's
no fate but what we make"?

571
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,734
If you carry me back,
you die too, Penny.

572
00:32:14,802 --> 00:32:16,235
I read it.

573
00:32:16,304 --> 00:32:19,505
Leaving me is the only way
you have a chance.

574
00:32:29,517 --> 00:32:30,883
- Penny.
- I got your book.

575
00:32:30,952 --> 00:32:32,585
What the hell?

576
00:32:32,654 --> 00:32:33,920
Penny? Oh, my...

577
00:32:33,988 --> 00:32:35,888
Help!

578
00:32:35,957 --> 00:32:37,557
Give me good news, Rafe.

579
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:40,359
Unfortunately, returning
from the Fairy Realm

580
00:32:40,428 --> 00:32:42,528
is, uh, problematic.

581
00:32:42,597 --> 00:32:46,198
All I have is this tincture
that takes you there.

582
00:32:46,267 --> 00:32:47,667
Why would I drink this?

583
00:32:47,735 --> 00:32:49,702
Then I'm stuck there
with Margo, and you can't

584
00:32:49,771 --> 00:32:51,003
get either of us out.

585
00:32:51,072 --> 00:32:52,838
Prince Ess of Loria, Your Majesty.

586
00:32:52,907 --> 00:32:54,340
Where's my father?

587
00:32:54,409 --> 00:32:56,742
Hey, I don't think we've formally met.

588
00:32:56,811 --> 00:32:58,110
Cut the shit.

589
00:32:58,179 --> 00:33:00,179
I will tear this place apart
if I have to.

590
00:33:00,248 --> 00:33:05,985
So uh, funny story, uh,
your... your dad is actually

591
00:33:06,054 --> 00:33:07,620
a rat person now.

592
00:33:07,689 --> 00:33:09,789
- Do it.
- He's...

593
00:33:23,504 --> 00:33:25,237
Break it down.

594
00:33:26,641 --> 00:33:28,608
Hakuna matata has failed me.

595
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:35,145
It pains me, but I simply
cannot go back to Fillory.

596
00:33:35,652 --> 00:33:39,755
So you're just gonna let Ember
turn Fillory into a telenovela?

597
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:42,257
Well, you don't understand how he is.

598
00:33:42,292 --> 00:33:44,393
He pitted animals against each other

599
00:33:44,428 --> 00:33:47,496
by offering only the sexiest
the ability to speak.

600
00:33:47,531 --> 00:33:50,065
Centaurs?
Drunk off his chair, obviously.

601
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,735
When he gets snacky, he talks
about turning humans into rats.

602
00:33:53,771 --> 00:33:56,271
Holy shit.

603
00:33:56,306 --> 00:33:58,073
Ember turned everybody into rats.

604
00:33:58,108 --> 00:33:59,508
Oh, he finally did it.

605
00:33:59,543 --> 00:34:01,676
That's been on his bucket list
for centuries.

606
00:34:01,712 --> 00:34:03,812
Ember cock-blocked me.

607
00:34:03,847 --> 00:34:06,782
You are a god of Fillory.

608
00:34:06,817 --> 00:34:09,084
Why are you just sitting here
and letting your brother

609
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,585
shit all over it?

610
00:34:10,621 --> 00:34:12,154
You let The Beast happen.

611
00:34:12,189 --> 00:34:15,590
You shut out a child who needed shelter,

612
00:34:15,626 --> 00:34:19,494
and when he became a monster, you ran.

613
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,496
You hate chaos?

614
00:34:21,532 --> 00:34:25,667
Then fix the chaos that you created.

615
00:34:30,941 --> 00:34:32,441
You're right.

616
00:34:32,476 --> 00:34:35,410
But some mistakes cannot be repaired.

617
00:34:35,446 --> 00:34:37,979
And from those, we must move forward.

618
00:34:38,015 --> 00:34:40,048
And I shall try to avoid repeating

619
00:34:40,084 --> 00:34:43,452
such mistakes in my new world.

620
00:34:43,487 --> 00:34:45,220
Fine...

621
00:34:47,291 --> 00:34:48,623
Then give us the clock.

622
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:50,892
Why do you care?

623
00:34:50,928 --> 00:34:52,794
Fillory's on its last legs.

624
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:55,864
Everything you've said tells me
Ember is tired of the game.

625
00:34:55,899 --> 00:34:58,433
He's likely to smash the place
like a toddler.

626
00:34:58,469 --> 00:35:01,403
Trust me, that'll be it. End of Fillory.

627
00:35:01,438 --> 00:35:03,171
And don't get sentimental.

628
00:35:03,207 --> 00:35:04,806
We aren't ready to walk away yet.

629
00:35:04,842 --> 00:35:06,975
We know you still love Fillory.

630
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:11,079
You literally have
every memento to prove it.

631
00:35:11,115 --> 00:35:12,814
If you can't fix it or won't save it,

632
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:16,551
then let us try.

633
00:35:16,587 --> 00:35:18,520
Please.

634
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:22,124
You love Fillory.

635
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:24,359
It's my home.

636
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:30,565
Then the clock is yours, Your Majesty.

637
00:35:30,601 --> 00:35:33,635
But heed my warning.

638
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:38,840
Nothing entertains Ember more
than a whimsical death.

639
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:03,965
- Hey.
- Hey.

640
00:36:04,001 --> 00:36:07,402
How's Penny? Still alive?

641
00:36:07,437 --> 00:36:10,105
I could've worded that better.

642
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:13,475
Yeah.

643
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:16,178
They cleared out the whole infirmary.

644
00:36:16,213 --> 00:36:18,213
Something about radiation.

645
00:36:18,248 --> 00:36:19,514
That can't be good.

646
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,249
And not much I can do about it
right now.

647
00:36:21,285 --> 00:36:23,385
So you've got time.

648
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:26,555
Kill it with me killing Reynard.

649
00:36:27,524 --> 00:36:29,457
Good news, found a spell in here.

650
00:36:29,493 --> 00:36:33,061
Turns metal objects
into god-piercing weapons.

651
00:36:33,096 --> 00:36:37,499
And if it can be anything, gun, right?

652
00:36:37,534 --> 00:36:42,237
But it took everything John
gave us just to make one bullet.

653
00:36:42,272 --> 00:36:45,740
So we've got one shot.

654
00:36:59,723 --> 00:37:00,555
Fall back.

655
00:37:00,591 --> 00:37:04,025
Don't inhale the... smoke...

656
00:37:19,209 --> 00:37:24,412
Oh, shit.

657
00:37:24,448 --> 00:37:27,549
Luckily, I'm a pro. Come on, come on.

658
00:37:30,621 --> 00:37:31,519
Fen?

659
00:37:31,555 --> 00:37:34,122
- Josh, you can see me?
- Fen!

660
00:37:34,157 --> 00:37:37,092
Josh, help me! Help me, please, hurry!

661
00:37:40,297 --> 00:37:43,865
Tick, tell my story.

662
00:38:04,888 --> 00:38:06,288
Well, this is it.

663
00:38:07,591 --> 00:38:09,924
The sign Reynard's been waiting for.

664
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,993
Come on out, asshole.

665
00:38:12,029 --> 00:38:17,265
Something feels so right about
tricking him with goddess omens.

666
00:38:17,301 --> 00:38:18,400
Amen.

667
00:38:18,435 --> 00:38:19,734
Let's get scarce.

668
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:21,269
Let's go.

669
00:38:36,687 --> 00:38:38,353
I know you're here.

670
00:38:38,388 --> 00:38:40,221
There he is.

671
00:38:40,257 --> 00:38:43,224
The lightning, the wind...

672
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:46,227
Always were a drama queen.

673
00:38:47,397 --> 00:38:50,265
I can't get a clear shot.

674
00:38:55,539 --> 00:38:56,871
Go on the other side.

675
00:38:56,907 --> 00:38:59,874
- I'll get you a clear shot.
- Kady!

676
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,309
Hey!

677
00:39:03,113 --> 00:39:04,846
I should have known.

678
00:39:04,881 --> 00:39:05,980
Where's Julia?

679
00:39:06,016 --> 00:39:09,351
Why don't you ask me where John is?

680
00:39:11,321 --> 00:39:13,154
What did you do?

681
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:15,123
Nothing he wasn't asking for.

682
00:39:15,158 --> 00:39:18,059
Hated you so much,
he begged me to kill him.

683
00:39:18,095 --> 00:39:19,361
You bitch!

684
00:39:19,396 --> 00:39:20,362
You liar!

685
00:39:32,275 --> 00:39:34,709
Kady, what...?

686
00:39:50,781 --> 00:39:52,875
It's you.

687
00:39:54,635 --> 00:39:59,071
You ignored us, and now you're here?

688
00:39:59,107 --> 00:40:01,774
All of a sudden?

689
00:40:01,809 --> 00:40:03,742
Why?

690
00:40:03,778 --> 00:40:07,246
To ask you to spare his life.

691
00:40:07,281 --> 00:40:08,581
I don't understand.

692
00:40:08,616 --> 00:40:11,450
Why do you care?

693
00:40:11,486 --> 00:40:13,786
He's my son.

694
00:40:18,059 --> 00:40:20,659
Did you know what he was doing?

695
00:40:23,764 --> 00:40:26,599
Of course you did.

696
00:40:26,634 --> 00:40:29,034
He raped me.

697
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:30,936
Your son.

698
00:40:30,972 --> 00:40:34,773
I'd be sobbing
and telling you every detail,

699
00:40:34,809 --> 00:40:36,809
but I lost my Shade in the abortion,

700
00:40:36,844 --> 00:40:41,147
so you're just gonna have to
take my word for it.

701
00:40:41,182 --> 00:40:42,748
Let me deal with him.

702
00:40:42,783 --> 00:40:44,950
Why would I trust you?
Come the fuck on, lady.

703
00:40:44,986 --> 00:40:47,520
There are consequences
to killing a god, Julia.

704
00:40:47,555 --> 00:40:50,623
I lost my friends. I lost everything.

705
00:40:50,658 --> 00:40:54,360
He turned me into a monster.

706
00:40:54,395 --> 00:40:56,996
You're a survivor.

707
00:40:59,634 --> 00:41:02,001
You're still capable of mercy, Julia.

708
00:41:02,036 --> 00:41:05,538
Don't let him rob you of that.

709
00:41:14,649 --> 00:41:17,016
It's your choice.

710
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:47,980
I am so disappointed
with what you've done.

711
00:41:48,015 --> 00:41:52,117
You left me. You left me.

712
00:41:52,153 --> 00:41:55,321
Well, I am back.

713
00:41:55,356 --> 00:41:58,090
And it's time to go.

714
00:41:59,427 --> 00:42:02,127
No, no!

715
00:42:02,163 --> 00:42:07,333
How could you do this after
everything we've been through?

716
00:42:07,368 --> 00:42:09,668
I killed John for this.

717
00:42:09,704 --> 00:42:10,936
It was the right thing.

718
00:42:10,972 --> 00:42:14,106
How the hell would you know that?

719
00:42:15,276 --> 00:42:17,076
Sorry, Kady.

720
00:42:41,769 --> 00:42:44,370
Our Lady sent me.

721
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:06,925
Hey, I'm sorry I hurt you.

722
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:14,066
I tried to do the right thing.

723
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:19,705
But I'm not sorry that you're alive,

724
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,574
and maybe that makes me selfish,
but I...

725
00:43:24,045 --> 00:43:27,713
The world's a better place
when you're in it.

726
00:43:30,151 --> 00:43:33,652
Say the word, and I'll stay.

727
00:43:36,424 --> 00:43:39,091
If you want me to leave you
alone for a while

728
00:43:39,126 --> 00:43:41,627
and figure this out on your own,
I mean, let's face it.

729
00:43:41,662 --> 00:43:43,896
There's probably nothing
that you can't figure out.

730
00:43:43,931 --> 00:43:46,632
You are Alice Quinn.

731
00:43:56,677 --> 00:44:00,412
Okay, so the plan so far is,

732
00:44:00,448 --> 00:44:02,848
find a way to stay in Fillory

733
00:44:02,883 --> 00:44:04,950
and never get banished again.

734
00:44:04,985 --> 00:44:08,854
Find a way to stop Ember or
drive him out or, I don't know,

735
00:44:08,889 --> 00:44:11,957
anything but letting him
get so bored he decides

736
00:44:11,992 --> 00:44:14,493
to just shake the Etch A Sketch
and end our kingdom,

737
00:44:14,528 --> 00:44:17,096
everyone I care about, and
the well spring in the process.

738
00:44:17,131 --> 00:44:19,898
So, thoughts?

739
00:44:19,934 --> 00:44:23,168
You're talking about conquering Fillory.

740
00:44:23,204 --> 00:44:24,536
For its own good.

741
00:44:24,572 --> 00:44:29,308
Your plan is the exact same
as The Beast's was.

742
00:44:29,343 --> 00:44:31,243
Shit.

743
00:44:34,749 --> 00:44:36,807
Do you got a better idea?

744
00:44:37,067 --> 00:44:42,067
