1
00:00:00,934 --> 00:00:02,378
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:04,428
Hey, can you help me
find some information?

3
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:05,529
What are you looking for?

4
00:00:05,606 --> 00:00:09,509
Well, say you have a being with
an enormous amount of power.

5
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:12,978
I'm looking for how someone
might, you know, defeat them?

6
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:15,914
<i>The Ars Deicidium?</i>
The art of killing gods.

7
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:17,103
Any word on the Poison Room?

8
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,177
Believe me, I wanna get in
there. It's above my pay grade.

9
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:21,347
Penny, Sylvia.

10
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,083
You really don't need
my help. With what?

11
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:24,954
Trying to break into
the Poison Room.

12
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:27,893
I am telling you the truth
because you are the one I trust.

13
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:30,260
And I really just need
your support right now.

14
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,026
<i>I controlled their minds.</i>

15
00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:33,294
Of course, honey.

16
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,598
<i>Just like you have
many, many times.</i>

17
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:37,614
<i>They said they were
just trying to summon</i>

18
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:38,948
<i>a little help from
some kind of goddess.</i>

19
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:40,770
They were summoning
an evil bitch.

20
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,976
The benevolent Our
Lady Underground?

21
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,067
It is all about her.

22
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:47,171
Grinding men and gods into the
fucking dirt, and then she leaves.

23
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:48,806
That's Ms. Persephone.

24
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,026
That's Our Lady Underground.

25
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,349
Julia. Why do you
look like a 12-year-old?

26
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:53,751
Because I'm her Shade.

27
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,516
Shades go to the Underworld.

28
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:56,589
Alice?

29
00:00:56,657 --> 00:00:57,657
Quentin.

30
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,919
I missed you so much.

31
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:01,018
Is there any way we
can take her with us?

32
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:04,831
Jules, what the hell? I know.

33
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,218
<i>This is my one shot, and
this is what I want to do with it.</i>

34
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:12,001
No one has ever
brought Niffin back to life.

35
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:14,701
Many try, but all...

36
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,611
We have something that
no one else has ever had.

37
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:25,209
We have Alice's Shade.

38
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:29,086
The meta-math has never
added up before, but with this...

39
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:33,320
Still tremendously bad idea.

40
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:36,295
Fine. Fuck him. He won't help
us, we'll take it to Dean Fogg.

41
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:40,633
With one morning fart,
I release more magic

42
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:42,966
than Henry Fogg
has in his whole life.

43
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,629
But you can't
get it up for this?

44
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:46,833
No, you can't. I won't.

45
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:53,270
The energy we would need
would take 100 Master Magicians.

46
00:01:58,919 --> 00:01:59,919
That's a battery.

47
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,587
That holds magical current.

48
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:06,985
That is the biggest one that I've ever
seen. How many of those do you have?

49
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,758
Not enough to spare. Took
years to make. And I need it. No.

50
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:13,127
What's more
important than a life?

51
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,560
You talk like life
means something.

52
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,503
If it doesn't, then what's the
point? This is what magic is for.

53
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:21,872
Boldly spoken, for student who
lacked the balls to control a flea.

54
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:25,902
Look, I survived your
abuse, and I got off my ass

55
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,505
and I went into the goddamn
world. What've you done?

56
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:30,983
You've sat around
and drank. Fuck you.

57
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:34,044
No, fuck you. Do you know
why Alice went to Brakebills?

58
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:35,999
To find out what
happened to her brother.

59
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:38,049
What happened
was his friend Emily

60
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:41,527
had the bad sense to fall in
love with you and it destroyed her.

61
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:44,064
And when he tried to help
it turned him into a Niffin.

62
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:48,364
Now tell me that you hold
zero responsibility for that.

63
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:52,204
You can't erase any of
that. But you can help Alice.

64
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,207
You can help Alice now.

65
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:09,779
You look worried.

66
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:15,094
Just thinking about Alice. She's
gonna be really pissed at me.

67
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:19,025
Yeah, but when she has
her Shade back, she'll get it.

68
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,624
Trust me.

69
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:23,536
Um...

70
00:03:24,237 --> 00:03:26,502
Speaking of Shades,
since this is probably

71
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:28,405
the last time I'm
going to have one...

72
00:03:28,475 --> 00:03:30,273
Look, you do not
have to do this.

73
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,847
Yes, I do.

74
00:03:33,914 --> 00:03:35,348
You're a good friend.

75
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:36,849
Better one than I deserve.

76
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:38,184
Not true.

77
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:40,811
Blah, blah, feelings bullshit.

78
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:45,188
Let's begin. First we separate
Shade, which will pull Niffin here.

79
00:03:46,026 --> 00:03:47,426
You memorized? Yeah.

80
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:49,053
You can handle it? Yes.

81
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:36,770
We're going to fix
you. But we just have to

82
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:39,672
lock you in here
for a minute, okay?

83
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:46,009
Thank you.

84
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,720
Julia, lock the cage.

85
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:18,308
She's coming.

86
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:40,264
Quentin! I will burn
you alive for this.

87
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,274
When you're ready, Coldwater.

88
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,640
It's gonna be okay.

89
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:49,377
Please. Please, Quentin, don't.

90
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,420
Hey.

91
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:33,253
I brought you some
clothes, if you, um...

92
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:37,796
Okay, um.

93
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:50,102
Why don't I go get you some
food. You haven't eaten in, um...

94
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:55,005
Mayakovsky said to...

95
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:58,842
Uh, start with really
bland food, so I thought...

96
00:06:59,886 --> 00:07:00,979
Oatmeal?

97
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,078
Why?

98
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:08,487
Why bland food? Or
why did I bring you back?

99
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,127
Hmm.

100
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:13,605
I couldn't leave you like that.

101
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:21,006
Alice...

102
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:25,509
Fuck you.

103
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,529
So, the Poison Room,

104
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,454
the code to the door changes

105
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:40,685
every couple hours. The
door itself is warded, alarmed.

106
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,058
And don't forget booby-trapped.

107
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:45,121
So instead of going through
the magical dismemberment door,

108
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,461
let's go through the back way.

109
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,263
That door isn't just a door.

110
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:52,529
It's a portal to another world.

111
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:54,039
That's where the Poison Room is.

112
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:57,042
So, if we find the
right fountain...

113
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,871
We can walk right in. I heard a
couple Librarians whispering about it.

114
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,777
The Poison Room fountain
has a stack of books for a statue.

115
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,582
If we split up, we could probably
find it within a matter of weeks.

116
00:08:07,654 --> 00:08:11,523
Weeks? No, no. I
got this. Think hours.

117
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:12,717
What makes you so cocky?

118
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:13,792
'Cause I'm a Traveler.

119
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,989
And for once, it's
not totally fucking me.

120
00:08:23,403 --> 00:08:26,237
It is customary to bow in the
presence of your High King.

121
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,165
I... We... How are you here?

122
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,969
I think, and by that I
mean I'm absolutely certain,

123
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,345
that I was banished. Had to be.

124
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:39,510
So, in the books,
Ember and Umber,

125
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:41,030
before Martin offed
him, they did this

126
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,454
to the Chatwins
all the time, right?

127
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:44,925
Mmm-hmm. Um...

128
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:49,821
Yeah. Uh, when the
adventure was done, or...

129
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:54,833
Or what, Q? My pregnant
wife is locked up in Fairy Gitmo,

130
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:56,836
I'm betrothed to a rat,

131
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,633
my pinot noir grapes
are nearly ripe.

132
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:02,701
My adventure's just begun. So
why else would Ember banish me?

133
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,005
Because I'm a fuck-up.

134
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:08,571
Yeah, so... So,
the button. Give me.

135
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,350
Uh, about that. Um...

136
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:14,012
We kind of bargained
it away to a dragon,

137
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,215
in exchange for tickets
to the Underworld.

138
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:21,826
You gave our only means of
traveling to Fillory to fucking Trogdor?

139
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:32,504
Oh.

140
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,778
Both the High King and
Queen have vanished,

141
00:09:42,849 --> 00:09:45,375
leaving you the only
Child of Earth in Fillory.

142
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:48,820
Oh, my God. They
were my ride home.

143
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,550
Um, yes.

144
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,592
Also, it makes you High King.

145
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:57,226
You can go to the Rainbow
Bridge to be crowned.

146
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:04,438
Meh. Let's skip the ceremony.

147
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:09,975
On to business, then.
Half the court are still rats.

148
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:12,035
The Talking
Beavers are in revolt,

149
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,740
they're demanding
dental coverage.

150
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:16,544
And the Measly Mountains, they've
disappeared. Completely, just...

151
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:19,848
Stop! The thrones are cursed!

152
00:10:20,887 --> 00:10:23,880
Okay, is anything not fucked?

153
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,992
Your High Kingliness, perhaps
this is all too much for you.

154
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:31,197
There was a great king on
Earth who had a philosophy.

155
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:36,259
<i>Hakuna matata.</i> Roughly
translated, it means, "No worries."

156
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,002
That's my philosophy, too.

157
00:10:38,404 --> 00:10:40,373
Who gives a shit about
a few Measly Mountains?

158
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,874
But... Erase them.

159
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:44,623
Bring in the talking rats to
translate for the rat-people.

160
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:48,512
And we are giving all those beavers
braces, because they deserve it.

161
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:50,740
Say it, Tick.

162
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,215
<i>Hakuna matata.</i>

163
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,051
That's what I'm talking about.

164
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:10,295
I'm sorry.

165
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:15,730
I got my Shade back.
And then I lost it again.

166
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:19,229
For good. But I also discovered

167
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,399
that I don't have to
be like The Beast.

168
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:24,371
With the right help, I can do
good. I just have a chip missing.

169
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:26,543
What do you want from me, Julia?

170
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:31,477
To be the missing chip. Tell
me when to tap on the brakes.

171
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,242
"Tap"?

172
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:35,554
Slam on them.

173
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,114
I trust you.

174
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:39,825
I need you.

175
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:44,463
Shit.

176
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,799
Okay. We can try it.

177
00:12:51,237 --> 00:12:53,832
Thing is, I think I kind of
need you too right now.

178
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:57,089
Something you need to know.

179
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:00,839
Does Reynard know
that you're here? No.

180
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:04,010
Okay. It's good. It's important
that we keep up appearances.

181
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,109
I know. I've seen what
he can do when he's angry.

182
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:09,521
John, tell her what you told me.

183
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:12,117
About Our Lady Underground.

184
00:13:13,326 --> 00:13:14,446
Reynard's obsessed with her.

185
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,772
I think they were
lovers, but she left him.

186
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,823
Everything that he has
done to her followers, to you...

187
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:23,028
It's not random. It's
to get back at her.

188
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,303
Yeah.

189
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:26,762
Holy shit.

190
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,212
Persephone is Our
Lady Underground?

191
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:39,108
I saw her icons when
I was down there.

192
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:42,278
Maybe we can use
her to lure Reynard.

193
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,184
Didn't you just say
that she disappeared?

194
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:47,125
Well, we just need to make
Reynard believe that it's her.

195
00:13:47,193 --> 00:13:49,253
If he thinks that
she's here, he'll come.

196
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:52,498
Well, okay, and then? We
still don't have a weapon.

197
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:54,767
We have him. What do you...

198
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:57,362
No! No! No! We're
not killing you

199
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:59,429
for your power,
John, that's insane.

200
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:03,465
Agreed. Off the table. What we
are gonna do is teach you magic.

201
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:05,435
I'm not a Magician.

202
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,604
No. You're more.

203
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:09,391
Which is why it should
be easy for you to learn.

204
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:11,415
I mean, we don't have the
juice to take Reynard on.

205
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:12,884
But you do.

206
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,869
Can you tell me again
what the dragon said?

207
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:21,556
You know Mayakovsky banned
me from seeing Alice for 48 hours?

208
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:24,693
He said that I am upsetting her.

209
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:25,925
Well, he's not exactly wrong.

210
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:27,057
I'm trying to help.

211
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,137
You did. Now maybe you can
help by letting it run its course.

212
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,228
What if she... Q.

213
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:36,002
The greatest Magician
on Earth is watching her.

214
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:38,442
I know Mayakovsky can
be a massive asshole,

215
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:40,946
but he's not gonna actually
let anything happen to her.

216
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:45,176
Not after what it cost
him to bring her back.

217
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,354
All right, let's do that.

218
00:14:57,663 --> 00:15:00,258
I know it's hard right now.
But it's gonna be okay.

219
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,195
I think.

220
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,932
Now will you please tell me what
Puff the Magic Dragon said to you?

221
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,610
"The first portal
is still open."

222
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,949
I thought that might
mean Stonehenge.

223
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:20,451
The kids go there
in book three...

224
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:22,653
How many times was
that portal opened?

225
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:26,490
Once. There's always
some new, unexpected...

226
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:32,060
Except for the first
one that they used.

227
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,532
Um, they went back and forth

228
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,468
through that clock all
summer, right? Mmm-hmm.

229
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:40,905
Until their mother died, and
their uncle sold all their stuff.

230
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,040
Um...

231
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,142
I think I saw it.

232
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:47,180
<i>At my Yale interview.</i>

233
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,040
Uh, it was the same one
as the one on the cover.

234
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:54,018
I mean, the guy died.

235
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:58,888
They probably sold it
off. But what if, um...

236
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,793
What if the clock I
saw was "the" clock?

237
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,594
Why the fuck are you taking a
nap instead of looking for me?

238
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,103
Margo?

239
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:15,431
I thought you were banished.

240
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:19,570
No, dumbass, I'm stuck in the
Fairy Realm. How can I see you?

241
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:24,608
Oh, shit. She must've
mixed in the wrong strain.

242
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:28,350
We wanted "bang like happy
pandas," not "see other worlds."

243
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:30,884
Never let an amateur
pack your bong, okay?

244
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:32,482
Listen, dipshit.

245
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,891
You have to find Rafe,
the squirrelly little prick

246
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:36,156
who works for the sloth.

247
00:16:36,229 --> 00:16:38,892
He got me here,
he can get me back.

248
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:42,166
You could say "please."
No, I literally could not.

249
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:45,672
I'm gonna go find Fen, you find
a goddamn way to get me back.

250
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:47,739
Okay.

251
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:49,732
Pretty sure this is it.

252
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:53,037
Book statue. Not the most
imaginative, those Librarians.

253
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:54,842
Yeah, but not stupid.
Look, it's covered.

254
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,646
And locked. Never
seen anything like this.

255
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,122
Six-stage Vermel
anti-tampering enchantment.

256
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:06,448
I can crack it.

257
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:20,572
That's pretty
varsity... for a kid.

258
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,372
My dad's a good teacher.

259
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:24,189
All right, so who
pissed him off?

260
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:26,424
You're going to a lot of trouble

261
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:29,039
to get at some of the most
powerful battle magic in the universe.

262
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,110
Somebody's about
to have a bad day.

263
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:32,845
I know it's hard for
men to imagine women

264
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:34,979
having their own
reasons for doing anything,

265
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:37,180
but I'm looking for my own book.

266
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:40,386
I've been hidden away in
a library for the last year.

267
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:44,021
No TV, no Wi-Fi. Had to find
some way to entertain myself,

268
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,689
so I started reading
Kanye's book.

269
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:48,458
By the way, he's
really misunderstood.

270
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:52,228
Anyway, right in the middle of a
sex scene, the book just stopped.

271
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:54,570
Kanye dies during sex?

272
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,735
That's the weird part. There
were 20 more pages, all blank.

273
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:00,138
It's a glitch, right?

274
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:04,513
But then every other book I
checked for somebody alive right now,

275
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:06,577
ends in 20 blank pages.

276
00:18:09,455 --> 00:18:10,895
The Order's known
about it for years.

277
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,255
They call it the
Great Blank Spot.

278
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:14,954
Some kind of
cataclysmic badness.

279
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:16,320
Well, what causes it?

280
00:18:16,395 --> 00:18:19,661
They don't know. Just that
it happens soon, like, weeks.

281
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,962
How's reading your
book gonna help?

282
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:27,683
Something happens
that affects the Library,

283
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:29,198
it'll be in a Librarian's book.

284
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:31,635
But right now, they're moving

285
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:33,288
all the Librarians' books
to the Poison Room.

286
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:34,312
Including mine.

287
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,825
The Order thinks that
once your book is written,

288
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,442
your fate is sealed.

289
00:18:38,517 --> 00:18:40,509
Well, I've never seen
a book be wrong. You?

290
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:44,114
No. But I saw them
reshelf your book 39 times.

291
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,617
If time loops exist, then
I'm Team Sarah Connor,

292
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:48,773
"No fate but what we make."

293
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:51,163
Fine. I'll grab
your book for you.

294
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,528
I'll get it myself.

295
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:53,998
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're not coming.

296
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,263
How are you gonna get back?
I can't travel anyone with me.

297
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:59,943
You think this is my first
time fountain spelunking?

298
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:18,150
Well, the fountain didn't
drop us in a lava pit,

299
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:19,886
so we've got that going for us.

300
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:35,884
When they named
it the Poison Room,

301
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:37,508
how literal do you
think they were being?

302
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:39,777
Let's just do this fast.

303
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,804
Yeah.

304
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,016
Coming in on the weekend!
Now, that is work ethic.

305
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,359
I was hoping to run
into you, actually.

306
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:57,530
I, uh, have questions,

307
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,057
and I would appreciate
some fatherly guidance.

308
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:05,365
I'd like that, too.

309
00:20:06,706 --> 00:20:07,706
Here.

310
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:12,837
Struck me that I've missed
a lot of birthdays. Open it.

311
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:21,746
What is...

312
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:23,517
You went back to the witches.

313
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:28,193
Where is she? Where is my wife?

314
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:29,661
Oh.

315
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:31,355
Here and there.

316
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:34,899
I saved you the biggest piece.

317
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:45,340
Are you still trying to be a good
person, as if there is such a thing?

318
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:49,413
Left alone, you would fight
and fight against your nature,

319
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,285
and you would waste so
much of what you really are.

320
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:58,851
If you think doing this is
going to turn me into you,

321
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:01,618
you don't understand
people at all.

322
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:04,028
I've been at it a long time.

323
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:06,155
Oh, look at Julia.

324
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:10,163
I put a tiny black
spot on her soul,

325
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:11,795
and she scrubbed at it so much,

326
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,169
she put a hole in it.

327
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:15,898
She can never go
back to who she is.

328
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:17,709
And now,

329
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:19,935
neither can you.

330
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:23,681
This

331
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:28,650
is an investment
in our future, son.

332
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:33,855
Someday, when you've
embraced what you really are,

333
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:37,529
you'll come find me.

334
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:03,048
Can I help you?

335
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:04,215
Hi.

336
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,023
We're looking for a clock.

337
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:09,327
It belonged to my grandfather.

338
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:13,463
The auction website,
it listed this address.

339
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:15,200
Auction websites don't do that.

340
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:18,403
Fine. We bribed the webmaster.

341
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:22,431
The clock's got a lot of
sentimental value. So...

342
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,305
Sorry. There's no clock here.

343
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:27,869
The clock was an unremarkable
thing, on its surface.

344
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:30,815
To keep his mind off the
troubles of war and family,

345
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:34,547
Martin set out to
repair its inner workings,

346
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,317
and in place of a
mechanical heart...

347
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:40,525
He found a new world.

348
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,457
That's my favorite
chapter in the book.

349
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,897
Holy shit, there are two of you.

350
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:52,003
Oh, don't touch that. Oh.

351
00:22:52,071 --> 00:22:53,071
Please, put that down.

352
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,500
Sorry. Okay.

353
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:58,610
Is that...

354
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:03,080
Screenplay for the failed
1983 feature film adaptation.

355
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:05,281
There is a Fillory movie?

356
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,512
No, the studio wouldn't
pay for the talking bears,

357
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:09,748
so the director,
he quit in protest.

358
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,055
Can I?

359
00:23:12,658 --> 00:23:13,658
Yeah.

360
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:17,859
Q. Uh, I found Grampy's clock.

361
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:20,962
Wait, they changed
the Chatwins...

362
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,093
To skateboarding
Americans. I know, a travesty.

363
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,680
And they got Jane
completely wrong.

364
00:23:25,704 --> 00:23:28,064
A girl that timid could never
grow up to be a Watcher Woman.

365
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:30,768
Okay, real talk.

366
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,703
I'll give you $1,000
for the clock.

367
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:33,905
It's a collector's item.

368
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:35,743
$20,000. It's not for sale.

369
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:40,013
Wait. The books never had
said who the Watcher Woman is.

370
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:46,291
Well, it's not hard to deduce.

371
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,419
Anyone who's
always wearing a hood

372
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:51,464
is clearly a character
you've met before.

373
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,265
You know, don't you?

374
00:23:55,868 --> 00:23:57,336
That it's all real. You...

375
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:00,137
You've been to Fillory.

376
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:03,703
"Been to Fillory."

377
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:06,838
Even in Fillory, the Watcher
Woman's identity is a secret.

378
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,346
Who are you? Oh, my God.

379
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:10,713
Q, he has horns.

380
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:15,382
Like Ember, like...
Just like Ember. What?

381
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:23,561
Holy shit.

382
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:28,194
Umber? In the flesh.

383
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:36,173
Are they in the eye
of... What even is that?

384
00:24:36,342 --> 00:24:37,708
Lightning storm, huge.

385
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,337
Happened every time Persephone
ascended from the Underworld.

386
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,913
She used to come every spring.
Now, decades, no pattern, no trace.

387
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:49,650
Except, these modern
accounts show four storms

388
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:52,317
stretched across the entire
swath of southern Europe.

389
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:55,320
And smack in the
center, Murs, France.

390
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:01,129
So, we just need to kick up
a light storm, a few twisters.

391
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,227
And Reynard will think Our Lady
is on Earth. He'll come running.

392
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,435
Are you okay? I, uh...

393
00:25:13,212 --> 00:25:14,212
I need a drink.

394
00:25:24,556 --> 00:25:25,717
How was spell practice?

395
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:27,649
I can barely make a spark.

396
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:28,970
I thought you said it'd be easy.

397
00:25:28,994 --> 00:25:30,434
You know, no
pressure, or anything...

398
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:32,693
Do you ever think about
where you'd be, if he hadn't...

399
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:34,632
Raped me?

400
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:39,562
No. I try to focus on who I was.

401
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:42,100
It's getting harder, though.

402
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,008
Reynard thinks he broke you.

403
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:48,239
That there's no coming
back from what he did.

404
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:50,215
You think that's true?

405
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,074
I hope not.

406
00:25:52,818 --> 00:25:53,945
Well, whatever happens...

407
00:25:55,888 --> 00:25:56,947
Don't let him be right.

408
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:05,524
I think you should
go get some pizza.

409
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:09,027
Okay.

410
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,636
Food run. Listen...

411
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,206
I wish we had time
to talk this through,

412
00:26:23,282 --> 00:26:25,046
but ultimately, I know
you'd agree with me.

413
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:26,544
What are you talking about?

414
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:30,388
Oh, my wards.

415
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,421
I'm sorry. Why?

416
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:34,621
Why are you doing this to me?

417
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:39,431
After everything Julia's been
through, I can't make her do this.

418
00:26:39,832 --> 00:26:40,856
Do what?

419
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:46,198
This is very good.

420
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:48,935
Tea? I don't have time.

421
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,807
Ah! Brilliant, the
shortcut. There!

422
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,008
I don't have time.

423
00:26:59,151 --> 00:27:00,847
I understood everything.

424
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,955
And now it's fading like a
dream that you woke me from.

425
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,385
Why can't I do magic?

426
00:27:06,525 --> 00:27:09,962
You are newborn again.
You must crawl, then walk.

427
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:11,155
How long?

428
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,323
What's the rush?

429
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:18,998
I'm stuck in this... This
oily, disgusting cage,

430
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:21,370
and I can't even fucking
see. I can't do anything.

431
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,184
On the contrary, you
are finally in a position

432
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,801
to do something interesting.

433
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:25,954
Fuck you. What do you know?

434
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:30,712
I know, as Niffin, you care
about nothing but your own mind.

435
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:36,047
So, congratulations. A
perfect life with zero meaning.

436
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:38,113
Now, as human...

437
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,749
Humans are weak pieces of shit.

438
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:52,065
Do you know what magic is?

439
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:56,974
Energy capable of
making this shithole world

440
00:27:57,042 --> 00:28:00,206
one fractional speck
less unbearable.

441
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:04,678
Because we shits
try so fucking hard.

442
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:08,383
And that is not
weakness, believe me.

443
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:11,285
You don't like this world? Good.

444
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,585
You see its faults,

445
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:16,288
it gives you focus and
solitude to actually fix it.

446
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:28,029
Adderall. To fortify you.
Makes you write like Tolstoy.

447
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,976
Don't make face.

448
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:34,240
Drugs are fun.

449
00:28:45,357 --> 00:28:47,917
Hey, I wasn't sure what
kind you wanted so...

450
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,755
I know, I...

451
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:56,360
Oh, my God.

452
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,473
He made me.

453
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,408
What?

454
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:06,409
He made me do the ritual.

455
00:29:07,546 --> 00:29:09,515
Collect his power.

456
00:29:15,187 --> 00:29:16,211
Hey.

457
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:20,321
You get yourself cleaned up,
and I'll handle the rest, okay?

458
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:30,936
There you are,
you son of a bitch.

459
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:32,136
Ah.

460
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:43,948
Sylvia, where are you? Sylvia!

461
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:46,149
Sylvia, read it when we
get back. We gotta go.

462
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:50,080
You betrayed Ember?

463
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:53,283
I wouldn't call it that.
I just had no choice.

464
00:29:53,425 --> 00:29:54,688
It was a matter of survival.

465
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,229
A condition of the agreement
I made with Martin Chatwin.

466
00:29:57,596 --> 00:30:00,998
He had Fillory booby trapped to
the gills. He was about to filet me.

467
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:04,262
So, you faked your own death
and you moved to Vancouver?

468
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,131
Well, if I had to leave Fillory,

469
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:08,105
Canada was the
obvious second choice.

470
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:10,165
What is it that you
enjoy about Fillory?

471
00:30:14,379 --> 00:30:18,510
It reminds me of a time before I
realized how shitty being an adult is.

472
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:19,846
And there's opium in the air.

473
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:21,844
And how do you
feel about turtles?

474
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:24,021
Indifferent, I guess.

475
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:25,455
Not a fan.

476
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,969
Would you sleep easier
knowing that your entire world

477
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:29,359
rested on the back of one?

478
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:30,628
Or several?

479
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:32,660
What? Why are you asking?

480
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:35,259
Because as visitors
to my previous work,

481
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,593
you make for an excellent
focus group for my new world.

482
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:42,604
Something I've been building.

483
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:44,542
Testing a few things out.

484
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,911
It's more of a
pocket world, really.

485
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,412
I call it Cuba.

486
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:53,243
That's already a place.

487
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:54,876
Is it? Yes.

488
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:56,353
You're sure? Absolutely sure.

489
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:57,680
Oh.

490
00:30:57,923 --> 00:30:58,947
Damn it.

491
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:02,084
Look, this is all
very interesting-ish.

492
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,493
But I have a kingdom to fix.

493
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:14,395
You were never meant to
fix Fillory. Of course I was.

494
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:19,069
No, you were meant to
entertain like some reality TV star.

495
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:21,807
Oh! Ember must've
found you so boring.

496
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:23,347
Boring?

497
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:27,544
Fillory was created out of
the unification of opposites.

498
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:31,252
Ember is a creature
of entropy and chaos.

499
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:33,918
And you have every season
of <i>Law & Order</i> on DVD.

500
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,923
The most perfect
show in creation.

501
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:40,031
When Ember and I were
together, there was balance.

502
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:42,531
Without me, chaos reigns.

503
00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:46,566
Give up, Children of Earth.
Fillory cannot be ruled.

504
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,571
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

505
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:58,173
Get up! Come on!

506
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,428
Just stop worrying about me
and fucking travel out already.

507
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:02,163
Look, I will carry your
ass back if I have...

508
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:03,280
You don't get it.

509
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:07,082
I don't make it
back to the rope.

510
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:11,587
My book didn't have
a blank spot. So what?

511
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:14,437
What happened to "there's
no fate but what we make"?

512
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:16,434
If you carry me back,
you die too, Penny.

513
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:18,092
I read it.

514
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,430
Leaving me is the only
way you have a chance.

515
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,411
Penny! I got your book.

516
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:36,182
What the hell? Penny? Oh, my...

517
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:37,254
Help!

518
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:39,724
Give me good news, Rafe.

519
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:44,360
Unfortunately, returning from
the Fairy Realm is problematic.

520
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:47,264
All I have is this tincture
that takes you there.

521
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:50,194
Why would I drink this?

522
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:51,634
Then I'm stuck there with Margo

523
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:53,063
and you can't get
either of us out.

524
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:56,140
Prince Ess of Loria, Your
Majesty. Where is my father?

525
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:59,372
Hey, I don't think
we've formally met.

526
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:02,471
Cut the shit. I will tear
this place apart if I have to.

527
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:05,717
So, uh, funny story.

528
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:09,781
Your dad is actually
a rat-person now.

529
00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:10,982
Do it. He's...

530
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:15,956
Oh.

531
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:26,728
Break it down.

532
00:33:28,907 --> 00:33:30,842
<i>Hakuna matata</i> has failed me.

533
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,240
It pains me, but I simply
cannot go back to Fillory.

534
00:33:39,084 --> 00:33:43,044
So, you're just gonna let Ember
turn Fillory into a telenovela?

535
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:45,054
Well, you don't
understand how he is.

536
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,456
He pitted animals
against each other

537
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:50,289
by offering only the
sexiest the ability to speak.

538
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,464
Centaurs? Drunk off
his chair, obviously.

539
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:56,592
When he gets snacky, he talks
about turning humans into rats.

540
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:58,064
Holy shit.

541
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:00,904
Ember turned
everybody into rats.

542
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:02,235
Oh, he finally did it.

543
00:34:02,741 --> 00:34:04,501
That's been on his
bucket list for centuries.

544
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:06,812
Ember cock-blocked me.

545
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:09,113
You're a god of Fillory.

546
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:13,255
Why are you just sitting here and
letting your brother shit all over it?

547
00:34:13,652 --> 00:34:14,984
You let The Beast happen.

548
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:18,585
You shut out a child
who needed shelter,

549
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:21,449
and when he became
a monster, you ran.

550
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:23,788
You hate chaos?

551
00:34:24,863 --> 00:34:28,095
Then fix the chaos
that you created!

552
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:35,172
You're right.

553
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,674
But some mistakes
cannot be repaired,

554
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,803
and from those we
must move forward.

555
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:44,842
And I shall try to avoid repeating
such mistakes in my new world.

556
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:47,484
Fine.

557
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:51,818
Then give us the clock.

558
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:53,051
Why do you care?

559
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:55,755
Fillory's on its last legs.

560
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:59,097
Everything you've said tells
me Ember is tired of the game.

561
00:34:59,164 --> 00:35:02,430
He's likely to smash the
place like a toddler. Trust me.

562
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:06,334
That'll be it. End of Fillory.
And don't get sentimental.

563
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:08,039
We aren't ready
to walk away yet.

564
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,836
We know you still love Fillory.

565
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,144
You literally have every
memento to prove it.

566
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:17,680
If you can't fix it or won't
save it then let us try.

567
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:20,775
Please.

568
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:24,415
You love Fillory?

569
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:26,516
It's my home.

570
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:31,992
Then the clock is
yours, Your Majesty.

571
00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:34,961
But heed my warning.

572
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:41,066
Nothing entertains Ember
more than a whimsical death.

573
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:06,563
Hey. Hey.

574
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:09,164
How's Penny? Still alive?

575
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:11,965
I could've worded that better.

576
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:14,338
Yeah.

577
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:18,475
Uh, they cleared out
the whole Infirmary.

578
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:21,136
Something about radiation.

579
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,839
That can't be good.

580
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:24,542
Not much I can do
about it right now.

581
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:25,742
So, you've got time.

582
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:28,413
Kill it with me,
killing Reynard.

583
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:32,791
Good news. I
found a spell in here

584
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:35,360
that turns metal objects
into god-piercing weapons.

585
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:38,729
And if it can be
anything, gun, right?

586
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:44,334
But it took everything John
gave us just to make one bullet.

587
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:46,866
So, we've got one shot.

588
00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:06,223
Fall back! Don't
inhale the smoke.

589
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:23,870
Oh, shit.

590
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:30,179
Luckily I'm a pro.
Come on. Come on.

591
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:34,675
Fen?

592
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,148
Josh, you can see me?

593
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:40,184
Fen! Josh, help me!
Help me! Please, hurry.

594
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:44,685
Tick...

595
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:46,225
Tell my story.

596
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,348
Well, this is it.

597
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,617
The sign Reynard
has been waiting for.

598
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:14,417
Come on out, asshole.

599
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:19,260
Something feels so right about
tricking him with goddess omens.

600
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:23,664
Amen. Let's get
scarce. Let's go.

601
00:38:40,084 --> 00:38:41,313
I know you're here.

602
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:42,581
There he is.

603
00:38:43,188 --> 00:38:45,214
The lightning, the wind.

604
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,987
Always were a drama queen.

605
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:52,026
I can't get a clear shot.

606
00:38:58,736 --> 00:38:59,965
Go around the other side.

607
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,451
I'll get you a clear shot. Kady.

608
00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:03,965
Hey!

609
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:06,043
Ah.

610
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,280
I should've known.
Where's Julia?

611
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,349
Why don't you ask
me where John is.

612
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:15,780
What did you do?

613
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:18,219
Nothing he wasn't asking for.

614
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:21,150
Hated you so much,
he begged me to kill him.

615
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:23,821
You bitch. You liar.

616
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:36,473
Kady, what...

617
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:56,150
It's you.

618
00:39:58,863 --> 00:39:59,990
You ignored us.

619
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:02,024
And now you're here?

620
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:04,167
All of a sudden?

621
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:06,703
Why?

622
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,734
To ask you to spare his life.

623
00:40:11,376 --> 00:40:14,005
I don't understand.
Why do you care?

624
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:16,771
He's my son.

625
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:23,651
Did you know what he was doing?

626
00:40:28,026 --> 00:40:29,255
Of course you did.

627
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:33,956
He raped me. Your son!

628
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:38,464
I'd be sobbing, and
telling you every detail,

629
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,803
but I lost my Shade
in the abortion,

630
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:42,864
so you're just gonna
have to take my word for it.

631
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:46,508
Let me deal with him.

632
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:49,107
Why would I trust you?
Come the fuck on, lady.

633
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:51,512
There are consequences
to killing a god, Julia.

634
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:56,577
I lost my friends, I lost everything.
He turned me into a monster.

635
00:40:58,556 --> 00:40:59,990
You're a survivor.

636
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:08,458
You're still capable of mercy,
Julia. Don't let him rob you of that.

637
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:20,138
It's your choice.

638
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:50,268
I'm so disappointed
with what you've done.

639
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:55,336
You left me. You left me.

640
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:57,273
Well, I'm back.

641
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:01,080
And it's time to go.

642
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,183
No! No!

643
00:42:06,491 --> 00:42:07,720
How can you do this?

644
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,990
After everything
we've been through?

645
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,259
I killed John for this.

646
00:42:13,965 --> 00:42:15,263
It was the right thing.

647
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:16,892
How the hell would
you know that?

648
00:42:19,437 --> 00:42:20,461
I'm sorry, Kady.

649
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:47,525
Our Lady sent me.

650
00:43:08,653 --> 00:43:10,212
Hey, I'm sorry I hurt you.

651
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:17,092
I tried to do the right thing.

652
00:43:22,133 --> 00:43:24,034
But I'm not sorry
that you're alive,

653
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:26,142
and maybe that makes
me selfish, but I...

654
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,173
The world's a better
place when you're in it.

655
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:35,947
Say the word and I'll stay.

656
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:42,720
If you want me
to leave you alone

657
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:44,619
for a while to figure
this out on your own...

658
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:47,687
I mean, let's face it, there's
probably nothing you can't figure out.

659
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:49,550
You are Alice Quinn.

660
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:01,996
Okay.

661
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,206
So, the plan so far is,

662
00:44:04,909 --> 00:44:08,175
find a way to stay in Fillory
and never get banished again.

663
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:12,115
Find a way to stop
Ember. Or drive him out or...

664
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,779
I don't know, anything
but letting him get so bored,

665
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:17,617
he decides to just
shake the Etch A Sketch

666
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:19,782
and end our kingdom,
everyone I care about,

667
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:21,417
and the Wellspring
in the process, so...

668
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:23,493
Thoughts?

669
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:25,758
You're talking about
conquering Fillory.

670
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:28,125
For its own good.

671
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:31,598
Your plan is the exact
same as The Beast's was.

672
00:44:33,471 --> 00:44:34,495
Shit.

673
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,243
Do you got a better idea?
