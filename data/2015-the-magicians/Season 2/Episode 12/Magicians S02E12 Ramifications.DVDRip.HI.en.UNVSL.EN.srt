Reynard believe that it's her.

she's here, he'll come.

They probably sold it
off. But what if, um...

00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,793

some way to entertain myself,

checked for somebody alive right now,

much of what you really are.

00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:58,851
If you think doing this is
going to turn me into you,

I've been at it a long time.

00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:06,155
Oh, look at Julia.

349
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:10,163
I put a tiny black
spot on her soul,

350
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:11,795
and she scrubbed at it so much,

351
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,169
she put a hole in it.

352
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:15,898
She can never go
back to who she is.

353
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:17,709
And now,

354
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:19,935
neither can you.

00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:23,681
This

356
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:28,650
is an investment
in our future, son.

357
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:33,855
Someday, when you've
embraced what you really are,

358
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:37,529
you'll come find me.

Hi.

364
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,023
We're looking for a clock.

365
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:09,327
It belonged to my grandfather.

366
00:22:10,095 --> 00:22:13,463
The auction website,
it listed this address.

367

368
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:18,403
(SIGHS) Fine. We
bribed the webmaster.

369
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:22,431
The clock's got a lot of
sentimental value. So...

370
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:24,305
Sorry. There's no clock here.

371
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:27,869
The clock was an unremarkable
thing, on its surface.

372
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:30,815
To keep his mind off the
troubles of war and family,

373
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:34,547
Martin set out to
repair its inner workings,

374

mechanical heart...

375
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:40,525
He found a new world.

376
00:22:42,761 --> 00:22:44,457
That's my favorite
chapter in the book.

00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,897
Holy shit, there are two of you.

378
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:52,003
Oh, don't touch that. Oh.

379
00:22:52,071 --> 00:22:53,071
Please, put that down.

380
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,500
Sorry. Okay.

381
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:58,610
Is that...

Screenplay for the failed
1983 feature film adaptation.

383
00:23:03,415 --> 00:23:05,281
There is a Fillory movie?

384
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:07,512
No, the studio wouldn't
pay for the talking bears,

385
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:09,748

he quit in protest.

I'll give you $1,000
for the clock.

00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:42,604
Something I've been building.

522
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:44,542
Testing a few things out.

523
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,911
It's more of a
pocket world, really.

524
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:51,412
I call it Cuba.

525
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:53,243
That's already a place.

526
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:54,876
Is it? Yes.

527
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:56,353
You're sure? Absolutely sure.

528
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:57,680
Oh.

529
00:30:57,923 --> 00:30:58,947
Damn it.

530
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:02,084
Look, this is all
very interesting-ish.

531
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,493
But I have a kingdom to fix.

532
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:06,325
(LAUGHING)

533
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:14,395
You were never meant to
fix Fillory. Of course I was.

534
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:19,069
No, you were meant to
entertain like some reality TV star.

535
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:21,807
Oh! Ember must've
found you so boring.

536
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:23,347
Boring?

537
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:27,544
Fillory was created out of
the unification of opposites.

538
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:31,252
Ember is a creature
of entropy and chaos.

539
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:33,918
And you have every season
of <i>Law & Order</i> on DVD.

540
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,923
The most perfect
show in creation.

541
00:31:37,596 --> 00:31:40,031
When Ember and I were
together, there was balance.

542
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:42,531
Without me, chaos reigns.

543
00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:46,566
Give up, Children of Earth.
Fillory cannot be ruled.

544
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,502
(SYLVIA PANTING, COUGHING)

545
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,571
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

546
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:58,173
Get up! Come on!

547
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,428
Just stop worrying about me
and fucking travel out already.

548
00:32:00,452 --> 00:32:02,163
Look, I will carry your
ass back if I have...

549
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:03,280
You don't get it.

550
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:04,788
(GRUNTS)

551
00:32:05,557 --> 00:32:07,082
I don't make it
back to the rope.

552
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:11,587
My book didn't have
a blank spot. So what?

553
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:14,437
What happened to "there's
no fate but what we make"?

554
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:16,434
If you carry me back,
you die too, Penny.

555
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:18,092
I read it.

556
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,430
Leaving me is the only
way you have a chance.

557
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,411
Penny! I got your book.

558
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:36,182
What the hell? Penny? Oh, my...

559
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:37,254
Help!

560
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:39,724
Give me good news, Rafe.

561
00:32:40,025 --> 00:32:44,360
Unfortunately, returning from
the Fairy Realm is problematic.

562
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:47,264
All I have is this tincture
that takes you there.

563
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:50,194
Why would I drink this?

564
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:51,634
Then I'm stuck there with Margo

565
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:53,063
and you can't get
either of us out.

566
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:56,140
Prince Ess of Loria, Your
Majesty. Where is my father?

567
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:59,372
Hey, I don't think
we've formally met.

568
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:02,471
Cut the shit. I will tear
this place apart if I have to.

569
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:05,717
So, uh, funny story.

570
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:09,781
Your dad is actually
a rat-person now.

571
00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:10,982
Do it. (CHUCKLING) He's...

572
00:33:12,057 --> 00:33:13,057
(ALL CHOKING)

573
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:15,956
(PANTING) Oh.

574
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:26,728
Break it down.

575
00:33:28,907 --> 00:33:30,842
<i>Hakuna matata</i> has failed me.

576
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,240
It pains me, but I simply
cannot go back to Fillory.

577
00:33:39,084 --> 00:33:43,044
So, you're just gonna let Ember
turn Fillory into a telenovela?

578
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:45,054
Well, you don't
understand how he is.

579
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,456
He pitted animals
against each other

580
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:50,289
by offering only the
sexiest the ability to speak.

581
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,464
Centaurs? Drunk off
his chair, obviously.

582
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:56,592
When he gets snacky, he talks
about turning humans into rats.

583
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:58,064
Holy shit.

584
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:00,904
Ember turned
everybody into rats.

585
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:02,235
Oh, he finally did it.

586
00:34:02,741 --> 00:34:04,501
That's been on his
bucket list for centuries.

587
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:06,812
Ember cock-blocked me.

588
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:09,113
You're a god of Fillory.

589
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:13,255
Why are you just sitting here and
letting your brother shit all over it?

590
00:34:13,652 --> 00:34:14,984
You let The Beast happen.

591
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:18,585
You shut out a child
who needed shelter,

592
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:21,449
and when he became
a monster, you ran.

593
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:23,788
You hate chaos?

594
00:34:24,863 --> 00:34:28,095
Then fix the chaos
that you created!

595
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:35,172
You're right.

596
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,674
But some mistakes
cannot be repaired,

597
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,803
and from those we
must move forward.

598
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:44,842
And I shall try to avoid repeating
such mistakes in my new world.

599
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:47,484
Fine.

600
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:51,818
Then give us the clock.

601
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:53,051
Why do you care?

602
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:55,755
Fillory's on its last legs.

603
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:59,097
Everything you've said tells
me Ember is tired of the game.

604
00:34:59,164 --> 00:35:02,430
He's likely to smash the
place like a toddler. Trust me.

605
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:06,334
That'll be it. End of Fillory.
And don't get sentimental.

606
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:08,039
We aren't ready
to walk away yet.

607
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,836
We know you still love Fillory.

608
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:13,144
You literally have every
memento to prove it.

609
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:17,680
If you can't fix it or won't
save it then let us try.

610
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:20,775
Please.

611
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:24,415
You love Fillory?

612
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:26,516
It's my home.

613
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:31,992
Then the clock is
yours, Your Majesty.

614
00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:34,961
But heed my warning.

615
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:41,066
Nothing entertains Ember
more than a whimsical death.

616
00:35:49,047 --> 00:35:51,073
(CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE)

617
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:06,563
Hey. Hey.

618
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:09,164
How's Penny? Still alive?

619
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:11,965
I could've worded that better.

620
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:14,338
Yeah.

621
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:18,475
Uh, they cleared out
the whole Infirmary.

622
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:21,136
Something about radiation.

623
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,839
That can't be good.

624
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:24,542
Not much I can do
about it right now.

625
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:25,742
So, you've got time.

626
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:28,413
Kill it with me,
killing Reynard.

627
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:32,791
Good news. I
found a spell in here

628
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:35,360
that turns metal objects
into god-piercing weapons.

629
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:38,729
And if it can be
anything, gun, right?

630
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:44,334
But it took everything John
gave us just to make one bullet.

631
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:46,866
So, we've got one shot.

632
00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:06,223
Fall back! Don't
inhale the smoke.

633
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:07,558

00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:23,870
Oh, shit.

636
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:30,179
Luckily I'm a pro.
Come on. Come on.

637
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:34,675
Fen?

638
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,148
Josh, you can see me?

639
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:40,184
Fen! Josh, help me!
Help me! Please, hurry.

640
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:44,685
Tick...

641
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:46,225
Tell my story.

642

JULIA: Well, this is it.

645
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,617
The sign Reynard
has been waiting for.

646
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:14,417
Come on out, asshole.

647
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:19,260
Something feels so right about
tricking him with goddess omens.

648
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:23,664
Amen. Let's get
scarce. Let's go.

651
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:42,581
There he is.

The lightning, the wind.

653
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:48,987
Always were a drama queen.

654
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:52,026
I can't get a clear shot.

655
00:38:58,736 --> 00:38:59,965
Go around the other side.

656
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,451
I'll get you a clear shot. Kady.

657
00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:03,965
Hey!

658
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:06,043
Ah.

659
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,280
I should've known.
Where's Julia?

660
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,349
Why don't you ask
me where John is.

661
00:39:14,619 --> 00:39:15,780
What did you do?

662
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:18,219
Nothing he wasn't asking for.

663
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:21,150
Hated you so much,
he begged me to kill him.

664
00:39:21,226 --> 00:39:23,821
You bitch. You liar.

665
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:28,366
(LAUGHING)

666
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:36,473
Kady, what...

667
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:56,150
It's you.

668
00:39:58,863 --> 00:39:59,990
You ignored us.

669
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:02,024
And now you're here?

670
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:04,167
All of a sudden?

671
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:06,703
Why?

672
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,734
To ask you to spare his life.

673
00:40:11,376 --> 00:40:14,005
I don't understand.
Why do you care?

674
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:16,771
He's my son.

675
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:23,651
Did you know what he was doing?

676
00:40:28,026 --> 00:40:29,255
Of course you did.

677
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:33,956
He raped me. Your son!

678
00:40:34,032 --> 00:40:35,032
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

679
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:38,464
I'd be sobbing, and
telling you every detail,

680
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:40,803
but I lost my Shade
in the abortion,

681
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:42,864
so you're just gonna
have to take my word for it.

682
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:46,508
Let me deal with him.

683
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:49,107
Why would I trust you?
Come the fuck on, lady.

684
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:51,512
There are consequences
to killing a god, Julia.

685
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:56,577
I lost my friends, I lost everything.
He turned me into a monster.

686
00:40:58,556 --> 00:40:59,990
You're a survivor.

687
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:08,458
You're still capable of mercy,
Julia. Don't let him rob you of that.

688
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:20,138
It's your choice.

689
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:50,268
I'm so disappointed
with what you've done.

690
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:55,336
You left me. You left me.

691
00:41:56,214 --> 00:41:57,273
Well, I'm back.

692
00:41:59,817 --> 00:42:01,080
And it's time to go.

693
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,444
(GASPS)

694
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,183
No! No!

695
00:42:06,491 --> 00:42:07,720
How can you do this?

696
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,990
After everything
we've been through?

697
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,259
I killed John for this.

698
00:42:13,965 --> 00:42:15,263
It was the right thing.

699
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:16,892
How the hell would
you know that?

700
00:42:19,437 --> 00:42:20,461
I'm sorry, Kady.

701
00:42:45,897 --> 00:42:47,525
Our Lady sent me.

702
00:42:57,275 --> 00:42:58,709
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

703
00:43:08,653 --> 00:43:10,212
Hey, I'm sorry I hurt you.

704
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:17,092
I tried to do the right thing.

705
00:43:22,133 --> 00:43:24,034
But I'm not sorry
that you're alive,

706
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:26,142
and maybe that makes me
selfish, but I... (STAMMERS)

707
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,173
The world's a better
place when you're in it.

708
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:35,947
Say the word and I'll stay.

709
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:42,720
If you want me
to leave you alone

710
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:44,619
for a while to figure
this out on your own...

711
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:47,687
I mean, let's face it, there's
probably nothing you can't figure out.

712
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:49,550
You are Alice Quinn.

713
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:01,996
Okay.

714
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,206
So, the plan so far is,

715
00:44:04,909 --> 00:44:08,175
find a way to stay in Fillory
and never get banished again.

716
00:44:09,213 --> 00:44:12,115
Find a way to stop
Ember. Or drive him out or...

717
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,779
I don't know, anything
but letting him get so bored,

718
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:17,617
he decides to just
shake the Etch A Sketch

719
00:44:17,688 --> 00:44:19,782
and end our kingdom,
everyone I care about,

720
00:44:19,857 --> 00:44:21,417
and the Wellspring
in the process, so...

721
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:23,493
Thoughts?

722
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:25,758
You're talking about
conquering Fillory.

723
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:28,125
For its own good.

724
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:31,598
Your plan is the exact
same as The Beast's was.

725
00:44:33,471 --> 00:44:34,495
Shit.

726
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,806
(CLOCK TICKING) (SIGHS)

727
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:40,243
Do you got a better idea?
