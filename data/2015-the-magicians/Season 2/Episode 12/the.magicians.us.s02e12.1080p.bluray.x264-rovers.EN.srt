1
00:00:00,991 --> 00:00:02,313
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:02,438 --> 00:00:04,535
Hey, can you help me
find some information?

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,505
What are you looking for?

4
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:09,235
Well, say you have a being with
an enormous amount of power.

5
00:00:09,355 --> 00:00:12,723
I'm looking for how someone
might, you know, defeat them.

6
00:00:14,359 --> 00:00:15,859
"The art of killing gods."

7
00:00:15,928 --> 00:00:17,127
Any word on the Poison Room?

8
00:00:17,195 --> 00:00:18,328
Believe me, I wanna get in there.

9
00:00:18,397 --> 00:00:19,896
It's... it's above my pay grade.

10
00:00:19,965 --> 00:00:21,331
Penny, Silvia.

11
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,099
- You really don't need my help?
- With what?

12
00:00:23,168 --> 00:00:24,734
Trying to break into the Poison Room.

13
00:00:24,803 --> 00:00:27,671
I am telling you the truth
because you are the one I trust,

14
00:00:27,739 --> 00:00:30,140
and I really just need
your support right now.

15
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,808
I controlled their minds.

16
00:00:31,877 --> 00:00:33,276
Of course, honey.

17
00:00:33,345 --> 00:00:35,478
Just like you have, many, many times.

18
00:00:35,547 --> 00:00:37,447
They said they were
just trying to summon

19
00:00:37,516 --> 00:00:38,748
a little help from some kind of god.

20
00:00:38,817 --> 00:00:40,784
They were summoning an evil bitch.

21
00:00:40,852 --> 00:00:42,686
The benevolent Our Lady Underground.

22
00:00:42,754 --> 00:00:43,954
It is all about her.

23
00:00:44,022 --> 00:00:46,056
Grinding men men and gods
into the fucking dirt,

24
00:00:46,124 --> 00:00:47,223
and then she leaves!

25
00:00:47,292 --> 00:00:48,558
That's Miss Persephone.

26
00:00:48,627 --> 00:00:50,093
That's Our Lady Underground.

27
00:00:50,162 --> 00:00:52,262
Julia, why do you look
like a 12-year-old?

28
00:00:52,331 --> 00:00:53,530
Because I'm her shade.

29
00:00:53,598 --> 00:00:55,832
Shades go to the underworld.

30
00:00:55,901 --> 00:00:57,767
- Alice.
- Quentin.

31
00:00:57,836 --> 00:00:58,868
I missed you so much.

32
00:00:58,937 --> 00:01:01,237
Is there any way
we can take her with us?

33
00:01:03,241 --> 00:01:04,574
- Jules, what the hell?
- I know.

34
00:01:04,643 --> 00:01:05,942
This is my one shot, and this is what

35
00:01:06,011 --> 00:01:07,110
I want to do with it.

36
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:12,382
No one has ever brought
niffin back to life.

37
00:01:12,451 --> 00:01:14,918
Many try, but all...

38
00:01:20,559 --> 00:01:23,426
We have something that
no one else has ever had.

39
00:01:23,495 --> 00:01:25,495
We have Alice's shade.

40
00:01:25,564 --> 00:01:27,998
The meta-math has never added up before,

41
00:01:28,066 --> 00:01:29,466
but with this...

42
00:01:31,269 --> 00:01:33,069
Still tremendously bad idea.

43
00:01:33,138 --> 00:01:34,637
Fine, fuck him.

44
00:01:34,706 --> 00:01:37,440
He won't help us.
We'll take it to Dean Fogg.

45
00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:40,543
With one morning fart,
I release more magic

46
00:01:40,612 --> 00:01:43,046
than Henry Fogg has in his whole life.

47
00:01:43,115 --> 00:01:44,514
But you can't get it up for this?

48
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:47,517
No, you can't. I won't.

49
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:49,888
The energy we would need

50
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:53,607
would take a hundred Master Magicians.

51
00:01:58,864 --> 00:02:00,497
That's a battery.

52
00:02:00,565 --> 00:02:03,566
That holds magical current.

53
00:02:03,635 --> 00:02:05,368
That is the biggest one
that I've ever seen.

54
00:02:05,437 --> 00:02:07,070
How many of those do you have?

55
00:02:07,139 --> 00:02:08,304
Not enough to spare.

56
00:02:08,373 --> 00:02:10,340
Took years to make, and I need it.

57
00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:11,941
- No.
- What's more important

58
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,109
than a life?

59
00:02:13,178 --> 00:02:14,477
You talk like life means something.

60
00:02:14,546 --> 00:02:15,986
If it doesn't, then what's the point?

61
00:02:16,048 --> 00:02:17,447
This is what magic is for.

62
00:02:17,516 --> 00:02:20,316
Boldly spoken for a student
who lacked the balls

63
00:02:20,385 --> 00:02:21,851
to control a flea.

64
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,955
Look, I survived your abuse,
and I got off my ass,

65
00:02:26,024 --> 00:02:27,290
and I went into the goddamn world.

66
00:02:27,359 --> 00:02:28,359
What have you done? You...

67
00:02:28,427 --> 00:02:30,260
you've sat around and drank.

68
00:02:30,328 --> 00:02:32,162
- Fuck you.
- No, fuck you.

69
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,297
Do you know why Alice
went to Brakebills?

70
00:02:34,366 --> 00:02:35,799
To find out what happened
to her brother.

71
00:02:35,867 --> 00:02:38,902
What happened was his friend
Emily had the bad sense

72
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,371
to fall in love with you,
and it destroyed her.

73
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,940
And when he tried to help,
it turned him into a niffin.

74
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:48,545
Now tell me that you hold
zero responsibility for that.

75
00:02:48,613 --> 00:02:52,482
You can't erase any of that,
but you can help Alice.

76
00:02:52,551 --> 00:02:54,651
You can help Alice now.

77
00:03:08,433 --> 00:03:11,067
You look worried.

78
00:03:11,136 --> 00:03:13,570
Just thinking about Alice.

79
00:03:13,638 --> 00:03:15,939
She's gonna be really pissed at me.

80
00:03:16,007 --> 00:03:20,577
Yeah, but when she has
her Shade back, she'll get it.

81
00:03:20,645 --> 00:03:22,312
Trust me.

82
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,549
Um... speaking of Shades,
since this is probably

83
00:03:26,618 --> 00:03:28,218
the last time I'm going to have one...

84
00:03:28,286 --> 00:03:32,188
Look, you do not have to do this.

85
00:03:32,257 --> 00:03:33,756
Yes, I do.

86
00:03:33,825 --> 00:03:37,293
You're a good friend,
better one than I deserve.

87
00:03:37,362 --> 00:03:38,294
Not true.

88
00:03:38,363 --> 00:03:40,296
Blah, blah, feelings bullshit.

89
00:03:40,365 --> 00:03:41,764
Let's begin.

90
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:45,902
First we separate Shade,
which will pull niffin here.

91
00:03:45,971 --> 00:03:47,303
- You memorize?
- Yeah.

92
00:03:47,372 --> 00:03:49,973
- You can handle it?
- Yes.

93
00:04:33,785 --> 00:04:37,587
I'm going to fix you,
but I just have to lock you

94
00:04:37,656 --> 00:04:40,156
in here for a minute, okay?

95
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,930
Thank you.

96
00:04:49,935 --> 00:04:52,769
Julia, lock the cage.

97
00:05:17,195 --> 00:05:18,328
She's coming.

98
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:38,514
Quentin!

99
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,650
I'll burn you alive for this!

100
00:05:40,719 --> 00:05:42,418
When you're ready, Coldwater.

101
00:05:42,487 --> 00:05:43,419
It's gonna be okay.

102
00:05:47,626 --> 00:05:49,292
Please, please, Quentin, don't.

103
00:06:27,398 --> 00:06:29,165
Hey.

104
00:06:31,035 --> 00:06:34,270
I brought you some clothes if you, um...

105
00:06:36,641 --> 00:06:38,674
Okay.

106
00:06:47,252 --> 00:06:48,684
Why don't I go get you some food?

107
00:06:48,753 --> 00:06:51,187
You haven't eaten in, um...

108
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:58,294
Mayakovsky said to start
with really bland food,

109
00:06:58,363 --> 00:07:01,497
so I thought oatmeal.

110
00:07:01,566 --> 00:07:03,799
Why?

111
00:07:03,868 --> 00:07:07,503
Why bland food? Or why...

112
00:07:07,572 --> 00:07:09,038
Why did I bring you back?

113
00:07:09,107 --> 00:07:12,241
Mm.

114
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,944
I couldn't leave you like that.

115
00:07:20,084 --> 00:07:21,884
Alice.

116
00:07:24,088 --> 00:07:26,122
Fuck you.

117
00:07:31,429 --> 00:07:33,362
So, the Poison Room.

118
00:07:33,431 --> 00:07:37,967
The code to the door
changes every couple hours.

119
00:07:38,036 --> 00:07:40,503
The door itself is warded, alarmed.

120
00:07:40,572 --> 00:07:42,104
And don't forget booby-trapped.

121
00:07:42,173 --> 00:07:45,174
So instead of going through
the magical dismemberment door,

122
00:07:45,243 --> 00:07:47,944
let's go through the back way.

123
00:07:48,012 --> 00:07:50,846
That door isn't just a door.

124
00:07:50,915 --> 00:07:52,715
It's a portal to another world.

125
00:07:52,784 --> 00:07:55,251
That's where the Poison Room is.

126
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,819
So if we find the right fountain...?

127
00:07:56,888 --> 00:07:58,287
We can walk right in.

128
00:07:58,356 --> 00:08:00,523
I heard a couple librarians
whispering about it.

129
00:08:00,592 --> 00:08:03,759
The Poison Room fountain has
a stack of books for a statue.

130
00:08:03,828 --> 00:08:06,329
If we split up,
we could probably find it

131
00:08:06,397 --> 00:08:07,663
within a matter of weeks.

132
00:08:07,732 --> 00:08:10,766
Weeks? No, no, no, I got this.

133
00:08:10,835 --> 00:08:11,835
Think hours.

134
00:08:11,869 --> 00:08:12,909
What makes you so cocky?

135
00:08:12,937 --> 00:08:14,337
'Cause I'm a traveler.

136
00:08:14,405 --> 00:08:17,106
And, for once, it's not
totally fucking me.

137
00:08:23,214 --> 00:08:26,582
It is customary to bow in
the presence of your High King.

138
00:08:26,651 --> 00:08:30,219
I...wh... How are you here?

139
00:08:30,288 --> 00:08:33,055
I think, and by that,
I mean I'm absolutely certain,

140
00:08:33,124 --> 00:08:36,225
that I was banished. Had to be.

141
00:08:36,294 --> 00:08:40,396
So in the books, Ember and Umber
before Martin offed him,

142
00:08:40,465 --> 00:08:42,832
they did this to the Chatwins
all the time, right?

143
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:47,837
Mm-hmm, um, yeah.

144
00:08:47,905 --> 00:08:51,407
When their adventure was done, or...

145
00:08:51,476 --> 00:08:52,675
Or what, Q?

146
00:08:52,744 --> 00:08:54,877
My pregnant wife
is locked up in Fairy Gitmo.

147
00:08:54,946 --> 00:08:56,646
I'm betrothed to a rat.

148
00:08:56,714 --> 00:08:59,015
My Pinot noir grapes are nearly ripe.

149
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:04,720
My adventure's just begun, so
why else would Ember banish me?

150
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:07,423
Because I'm a fuck up. That's it.

151
00:09:07,492 --> 00:09:09,859
So the button. Gimme.

152
00:09:09,927 --> 00:09:13,229
Uh, about that, um,
we kind of bargained it away

153
00:09:13,297 --> 00:09:16,866
to a dragon in exchange
for tickets to the Underworld.

154
00:09:16,934 --> 00:09:20,569
You gave our only means
of traveling to Fillory

155
00:09:20,638 --> 00:09:23,272
to fucking Trogdor?

156
00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:32,682
Oh.

157
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,892
Both the high king and queen
have vanished

158
00:09:42,939 --> 00:09:45,166
leaving you the only
Child of Earth in Fillory.

159
00:09:45,286 --> 00:09:46,607
Oh, my God.

160
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,003
They were my ride home.

161
00:09:49,123 --> 00:09:52,811
Um, yes, also it makes you High King.

162
00:09:54,925 --> 00:09:57,916
You can go to the Rainbow Bridge
to be crowned.

163
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,361
Meh, let's skip the ceremony.

164
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,530
On to business, then.

165
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:10,065
Half the court are still rats.

166
00:10:10,134 --> 00:10:12,201
The talking beavers are in revolt.

167
00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:13,769
They're demanding dental coverage.

168
00:10:13,838 --> 00:10:15,718
And the Measly Mountains,
they've disappeared.

169
00:10:15,773 --> 00:10:18,040
Completely just... Stop!

170
00:10:18,108 --> 00:10:20,976
The thrones are cursed.

171
00:10:21,045 --> 00:10:24,413
Okay, is anything not fucked?

172
00:10:24,482 --> 00:10:28,484
Your High Kingliness, perhaps
this is all too much for you.

173
00:10:28,552 --> 00:10:31,787
There was a great king
on Earth who had a philosophy:

174
00:10:31,856 --> 00:10:33,822
"Hakuna matata."

175
00:10:33,891 --> 00:10:36,692
Roughly translated,
it means, "no worries."

176
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,293
That's my philosophy too.

177
00:10:38,362 --> 00:10:40,662
Who gives a shit
about a few Measly Mountains?

178
00:10:40,731 --> 00:10:42,264
- But...
- Erase them.

179
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,500
Bring in the talking rats
to translate for the rat people,

180
00:10:44,568 --> 00:10:47,369
and we are giving
all those beavers braces

181
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,705
because they deserve it.

182
00:10:49,773 --> 00:10:51,273
Say it, Tick.

183
00:10:53,777 --> 00:10:55,811
Hakuna matata.

184
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,080
That's what I'm talking about.

185
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,720
I'm sorry.

186
00:12:11,789 --> 00:12:13,689
I got my Shade back.

187
00:12:13,757 --> 00:12:17,092
And then I lost it again for good,

188
00:12:17,161 --> 00:12:20,796
but I also discovered
that I don't have to be

189
00:12:20,864 --> 00:12:21,964
like The Beast.

190
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:23,665
With the right help, I can do good.

191
00:12:23,734 --> 00:12:25,100
I just have a chip missing.

192
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:27,736
What do you want from me, Julia?

193
00:12:27,805 --> 00:12:30,038
To be the missing chip.

194
00:12:30,107 --> 00:12:32,307
Tell me when to tap on the brakes.

195
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,376
Tap?

196
00:12:34,445 --> 00:12:36,845
Slam on them.

197
00:12:36,914 --> 00:12:38,847
I trust you.

198
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,984
I need you.

199
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:45,487
Shit.

200
00:12:47,591 --> 00:12:50,859
Okay, we can try it.

201
00:12:50,928 --> 00:12:55,931
The thing is, I think I kind of
need you too right now.

202
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,533
There's something you need to know.

203
00:12:58,602 --> 00:13:00,469
Does Reynard know that you're here?

204
00:13:00,537 --> 00:13:01,269
No.

205
00:13:01,338 --> 00:13:02,537
Okay, that's good.

206
00:13:02,606 --> 00:13:04,072
It's important that
we keep up appearances.

207
00:13:04,141 --> 00:13:05,474
I know. I've seen what he can do

208
00:13:05,542 --> 00:13:06,441
when he's angry.

209
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:10,812
John, tell her what you told me

210
00:13:10,881 --> 00:13:13,181
about Our Lady Underground.

211
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,017
Reynard's obsessed with her.

212
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,618
I think they were lovers,
but she left him.

213
00:13:16,687 --> 00:13:19,788
Everything that he's done
to her followers, to you...

214
00:13:19,857 --> 00:13:21,923
It's not random.

215
00:13:21,992 --> 00:13:25,627
- It's to get back at her.
- Yeah.

216
00:13:25,696 --> 00:13:28,130
Holy shit.

217
00:13:34,638 --> 00:13:37,372
Persephone is Our lady Underground.

218
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,574
I saw her icons when I was down there.

219
00:13:39,643 --> 00:13:42,411
Maybe we can use her to lure Reynard.

220
00:13:42,479 --> 00:13:44,246
Didn't you just say
that she disappeared?

221
00:13:44,314 --> 00:13:46,034
Well, we just need
to make Reynard believe

222
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,516
that it's her.

223
00:13:47,584 --> 00:13:49,584
If he thinks that she's here,
he'll come.

224
00:13:49,653 --> 00:13:51,019
Well, okay, and then?

225
00:13:51,088 --> 00:13:53,055
We still don't have a weapon.

226
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,189
We have him.

227
00:13:54,258 --> 00:13:56,258
- What do you...?
- No, no, no,

228
00:13:56,326 --> 00:13:58,360
we are not killing you
for your power, John.

229
00:13:58,429 --> 00:13:59,928
- That's insane.
- Agreed.

230
00:13:59,997 --> 00:14:01,129
Off the table.

231
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:03,799
What we are gonna do is teach you magic.

232
00:14:03,867 --> 00:14:05,067
I'm not a Magician.

233
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,469
No, you're more,

234
00:14:07,538 --> 00:14:09,337
which is why it should be
easy for you to learn.

235
00:14:09,406 --> 00:14:13,375
I mean, we don't have the juice
to take Reynard on, but you do.

236
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,580
Can you tell me again
what the dragon said?

237
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:22,317
You know Mayakovsky banned me
from seeing Alice for 48 hours?

238
00:14:22,386 --> 00:14:24,519
He said that I am upsetting her.

239
00:14:24,588 --> 00:14:26,188
Well, he's not exactly wrong.

240
00:14:26,256 --> 00:14:27,522
Trying to help.

241
00:14:27,591 --> 00:14:29,691
You did. Now maybe you can help

242
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,493
- by letting it run its course.
- What if she...?

243
00:14:31,562 --> 00:14:36,098
Q, the greatest Magician
on Earth is watching her.

244
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:38,433
I know Mayakovsky can be
a massive asshole,

245
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:43,038
but he's not gonna actually
let anything happen to her,

246
00:14:43,107 --> 00:14:47,976
not after what it cost him
to bring her back.

247
00:14:48,045 --> 00:14:50,512
All right, let's do that.

248
00:14:57,554 --> 00:15:01,823
I know it's hard right now,
but it's gonna be okay.

249
00:15:01,892 --> 00:15:03,325
I think.

250
00:15:03,393 --> 00:15:05,527
Now will you please tell me
what Puff the Magic Dragon

251
00:15:05,596 --> 00:15:08,330
said to you?

252
00:15:08,398 --> 00:15:12,501
"The first portal is still open."

253
00:15:14,338 --> 00:15:16,972
I thought that might mean Stonehenge.

254
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,442
The kids go there in Book Three.

255
00:15:20,511 --> 00:15:22,844
How many times was that portal open?

256
00:15:22,913 --> 00:15:24,179
Once.

257
00:15:24,248 --> 00:15:27,582
It's always some new, unexpected...

258
00:15:29,153 --> 00:15:32,521
Except the first one that they used.

259
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:35,724
They went back and forth
through that clock

260
00:15:35,793 --> 00:15:36,793
all summer, right?

261
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,927
- Mm-hmm.
- Until their mother died

262
00:15:38,996 --> 00:15:41,730
and their uncle sold all their stuff.

263
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:45,433
Um, I think I saw it.

264
00:15:45,502 --> 00:15:48,103
At my Yale interview.

265
00:15:48,172 --> 00:15:52,474
It was the same one
as the one on the cover.

266
00:15:52,543 --> 00:15:57,412
I mean, the guy died.
They... they probably sold it off,

267
00:15:57,481 --> 00:16:01,249
but what if, um, what if the clock I saw

268
00:16:01,318 --> 00:16:03,585
was the clock?

269
00:16:07,191 --> 00:16:11,493
Why the ...ck are you taking
a nap instead of looking for me?

270
00:16:11,562 --> 00:16:13,829
Margo?

271
00:16:13,897 --> 00:16:15,430
I-I thought you were banished.

272
00:16:15,499 --> 00:16:18,733
No, dumbass, I'm stuck
in the Fairy Realm.

273
00:16:18,802 --> 00:16:21,736
How can I see you?

274
00:16:21,805 --> 00:16:25,040
Oh, shit, she must've
mixed in the wrong strain.

275
00:16:25,108 --> 00:16:26,808
We wanted "bang like happy pandas,"

276
00:16:26,877 --> 00:16:28,543
not "see other worlds."

277
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:30,812
Never let an amateur
pack your bong, okay?

278
00:16:30,881 --> 00:16:33,748
Listen, dipshit, you have to find Rafe,

279
00:16:33,817 --> 00:16:36,218
the squirrely little prick
who works for the sloth.

280
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:39,221
He got me here. He can get me back.

281
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,222
You could say "please."

282
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,157
No, I literally could not.

283
00:16:42,226 --> 00:16:43,491
I'm gonna go find Fen.

284
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,795
You find a goddamn way to get me back.

285
00:16:46,864 --> 00:16:48,563
Okay.

286
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:49,764
Pretty sure this is it.

287
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:50,966
Book statue.

288
00:16:51,034 --> 00:16:52,834
Not the most imaginative,
those librarians.

289
00:16:52,903 --> 00:16:55,403
Yeah, but not stupid.
Look at this cover.

290
00:16:57,941 --> 00:16:59,241
And locked.

291
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:01,409
I've never seen anything like this.

292
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:05,547
Six-stage Vermel
anti-tampering enchantment.

293
00:17:05,616 --> 00:17:07,182
I can crack it.

294
00:17:17,961 --> 00:17:19,594
Pretty varsity...

295
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,096
For a kid.

296
00:17:21,164 --> 00:17:22,697
My dad's a good teacher.

297
00:17:22,766 --> 00:17:24,866
All right, so who pissed him off?

298
00:17:24,935 --> 00:17:27,202
You're going to a lot of trouble
to get at some of the most

299
00:17:27,271 --> 00:17:29,304
powerful battle magic in the universe.

300
00:17:29,373 --> 00:17:30,972
Somebody's about to have a bad day.

301
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,674
I know it's hard for men
to imagine women

302
00:17:32,743 --> 00:17:35,076
having their own reasons
for doing anything,

303
00:17:35,145 --> 00:17:37,612
but I'm looking for my own book.

304
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,348
I've been hidden away
in a library for the last year.

305
00:17:40,417 --> 00:17:43,051
No TV, no Wi-Fi, had to find some way

306
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,821
to entertain myself, so
I started reading Kanye's book.

307
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,957
By the way, he's really misunderstood.

308
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,159
Anyway, right in the middle
of a sex scene,

309
00:17:51,228 --> 00:17:52,894
the book just stopped.

310
00:17:52,963 --> 00:17:54,362
Kanye dies during sex?

311
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,630
That's the weird part.

312
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:58,633
There were 20 more pages, all blank.

313
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,201
It's a glitch, right?

314
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:03,571
But then, every other book
I checked of somebody alive

315
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,942
right now ends in 20 blank pages.

316
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:11,413
The Order's known about it
for years... they call it

317
00:18:11,481 --> 00:18:15,016
the Great Blank Spot, some kind
of cataclysmic badness.

318
00:18:15,085 --> 00:18:16,518
Well, what causes it?

319
00:18:16,586 --> 00:18:18,153
They don't know,
just that it happens soon,

320
00:18:18,221 --> 00:18:20,655
like, weeks.

321
00:18:24,528 --> 00:18:25,961
How is reading your book gonna help?

322
00:18:26,029 --> 00:18:27,829
Something happens
that affects the library,

323
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,865
it'll be in a librarian's book,
but right now,

324
00:18:30,934 --> 00:18:32,600
they're moving all the librarians' books

325
00:18:32,669 --> 00:18:34,936
to the Poison Room, including mine.

326
00:18:35,005 --> 00:18:37,372
The Order thinks that
once your book is written,

327
00:18:37,441 --> 00:18:38,673
your fate is sealed.

328
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,075
Well, I've never seen a book be wrong.

329
00:18:40,143 --> 00:18:42,277
- You?
- No, but I saw them

330
00:18:42,346 --> 00:18:45,480
reshelve your book 39 times.

331
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:47,549
Time loops exist,
then I'm team Sarah Connor:

332
00:18:47,617 --> 00:18:48,917
"No fate but what we make."

333
00:18:48,986 --> 00:18:51,019
Fine, I'll grab your book for you.

334
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,387
I can get it myself.

335
00:18:52,456 --> 00:18:54,255
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you're not coming.

336
00:18:54,324 --> 00:18:57,759
How are you gonna get back?
I can't travel anyone with me.

337
00:18:57,828 --> 00:19:00,628
Think this is my first time
fountain spelunking?

338
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,272
Well, fountain didn't
drop us in a lava pit,

339
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:21,968
so we've got that going for us.

340
00:19:34,724 --> 00:19:36,390
When they named it
the Poison Room, how literal

341
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,559
do you think they were being?

342
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:41,028
Let's just do this fast.

343
00:19:41,064 --> 00:19:42,064
Yeah.

344
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,103
Coming in on the weekend.

345
00:19:49,138 --> 00:19:51,072
Now, that is work ethic.

346
00:19:52,242 --> 00:19:55,042
I was hoping to run into you, actually.

347
00:19:55,078 --> 00:19:59,380
I, uh, have questions,
and I would appreciate

348
00:19:59,415 --> 00:20:04,285
some fatherly guidance.

349
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,054
I'd like that too.

350
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:09,557
Here.

351
00:20:09,592 --> 00:20:12,560
It struck me that I've missed
a lot of birthdays.

352
00:20:12,595 --> 00:20:13,895
Open it.

353
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:22,403
N...what is...?

354
00:20:22,438 --> 00:20:25,473
You went back to the witches.

355
00:20:25,508 --> 00:20:26,841
Where is she?

356
00:20:26,876 --> 00:20:28,809
Where's my wife?

357
00:20:28,845 --> 00:20:33,014
Oh, here and there.

358
00:20:33,049 --> 00:20:35,616
I saved you the biggest piece.

359
00:20:42,091 --> 00:20:43,925
Are you still trying
to be a good person?

360
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,093
As if there is such a thing.

361
00:20:46,129 --> 00:20:50,998
Left alone, you would fight
and fight against your nature.

362
00:20:51,034 --> 00:20:54,201
And you would waste so much
of what you really are.

363
00:20:54,237 --> 00:20:59,707
If you think doing this
is going to turn me into you,

364
00:20:59,742 --> 00:21:02,643
you don't understand people at all.

365
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:05,279
I've been at it a long time.

366
00:21:05,315 --> 00:21:07,548
Well, look at Julia.

367
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:10,117
I put a tiny black spot on her soul,

368
00:21:10,153 --> 00:21:14,522
and she scrubbed at it so much
she put a hole in it.

369
00:21:14,557 --> 00:21:16,991
She can never go back to who she is.

370
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,526
Now...

371
00:21:18,561 --> 00:21:20,528
neither can you.

372
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:27,234
This is an investment

373
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:29,670
in our future, son.

374
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:31,205
Someday,

375
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:36,410
when you've embraced
what you really are,

376
00:21:36,446 --> 00:21:39,213
you'll come find me.

377
00:22:01,971 --> 00:22:03,838
Can I help you?

378
00:22:03,873 --> 00:22:07,942
Hi, we're looking for a clock.

379
00:22:07,977 --> 00:22:10,144
It belonged to my grandfather.

380
00:22:10,179 --> 00:22:13,814
The auction website,
it listed this address.

381
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,516
Auction websites don't do that.

382
00:22:15,551 --> 00:22:16,984
Ugh, fine.

383
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,987
We bribed the webmaster.

384
00:22:20,023 --> 00:22:22,590
The clock's got a lot
of sentimental value, so.

385
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:24,492
Sorry, there's no clock here.

386
00:22:24,527 --> 00:22:28,496
"The clock was an unremarkable
thing on its surface.

387
00:22:28,531 --> 00:22:31,032
"To keep his mind off
the troubles of war and family,

388
00:22:31,067 --> 00:22:34,835
"Martin set out to repair
its inner workings,

389
00:22:34,871 --> 00:22:38,672
"and in place of a mechanical heart..."

390
00:22:39,709 --> 00:22:42,910
"He found a new world."

391
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:45,479
That's my favorite chapter in the book.

392
00:22:49,218 --> 00:22:50,985
Holy shit, there are two of you.

393
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,420
- Don't touch that.
- Oh.

394
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:53,421
Please, put that down.

395
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:55,923
Sorry, okay.

396
00:22:57,827 --> 00:22:59,593
Is that...?

397
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:03,597
A screenplay for the failed
1983 feature film adaptation.

398
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:05,266
There was a "Fillory" movie?

399
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:07,701
No, the studio wouldn't
pay for the talking bears,

400
00:23:07,737 --> 00:23:10,271
so the director, he quit in protest.

401
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:12,773
Can I?

402
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:14,675
Yeah.

403
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:19,113
Q, uh, I found Grampy's clock.

404
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:21,082
Wait, they changed the Chatwins...

405
00:23:21,117 --> 00:23:22,683
Skateboarding Americans.

406
00:23:22,718 --> 00:23:24,251
I know, a travesty.

407
00:23:24,287 --> 00:23:25,986
And they got Jane completely wrong.

408
00:23:26,022 --> 00:23:29,623
A girl that timid could never
grow up to be a Watcherwoman.

409
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:32,593
Okay, real talk, I'll give you
$1,000 for the clock.

410
00:23:32,628 --> 00:23:33,861
It's a collector's item.

411
00:23:33,896 --> 00:23:35,963
- $20,000.
- It's not for sale.

412
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:40,935
Wait, the books never said
who the Watcherwoman is.

413
00:23:43,406 --> 00:23:47,374
Well, it's... it's not hard to deduce.

414
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:50,010
Anyone who's always wearing
a hood is clearly

415
00:23:50,046 --> 00:23:53,514
a character you've met before.

416
00:23:53,549 --> 00:23:55,783
You know, don't you?

417
00:23:55,818 --> 00:24:00,688
That it's all real.
You... you've been to Fillory.

418
00:24:02,592 --> 00:24:04,258
Been to Fillory.

419
00:24:04,293 --> 00:24:06,427
Even in Fillory
the Watcherwoman's identity

420
00:24:06,462 --> 00:24:07,595
is a secret. Who are you?

421
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:10,164
Oh, my God, Q.

422
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:12,733
He has horns.

423
00:24:12,768 --> 00:24:15,202
Like Ember, like, just like Ember.

424
00:24:15,238 --> 00:24:16,804
What?

425
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:18,973
Oh.

426
00:24:22,845 --> 00:24:26,280
Holy shit.

427
00:24:26,315 --> 00:24:27,281
Umber?

428
00:24:27,316 --> 00:24:29,483
In the flesh.

429
00:24:32,301 --> 00:24:34,301
Are they in the eye of...

430
00:24:34,631 --> 00:24:36,234
What even is that?

431
00:24:36,302 --> 00:24:37,702
Lightning storm, huge.

432
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:41,539
Happened every time Persephone
ascended from the Underworld.

433
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:42,973
She used to come every spring.

434
00:24:43,042 --> 00:24:46,544
Now, decades, no pattern, no trace.

435
00:24:46,612 --> 00:24:50,247
Except these modern accounts
show four storms stretch across

436
00:24:50,316 --> 00:24:52,683
the entire swath of Southern Europe,

437
00:24:52,752 --> 00:24:56,187
and, smack in the center, Murs, France.

438
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,990
So we just need
to kick up a light storm,

439
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:01,926
- a few twisters.
- And Reynard will think

440
00:25:01,994 --> 00:25:03,394
Our Lady is on Earth.

441
00:25:03,463 --> 00:25:04,995
He'll come running.

442
00:25:05,064 --> 00:25:05,996
Yeah.

443
00:25:09,769 --> 00:25:10,701
Are you okay?

444
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:14,605
I...I need a drink.

445
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,417
How was spell practice?

446
00:25:26,486 --> 00:25:28,819
I can barely make a spark.
I thought you said it'd be easy.

447
00:25:28,888 --> 00:25:30,421
You know, no pressure or anything...

448
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:33,524
Do you ever think about
where you'd be if he hadn't...

449
00:25:33,593 --> 00:25:35,860
Raped me?

450
00:25:36,863 --> 00:25:40,664
No, I try to focus on who I was.

451
00:25:40,733 --> 00:25:44,402
It's getting harder, though.

452
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:47,371
Reynard thinks he broke you,
that there's no coming back

453
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,606
from what he did.

454
00:25:48,674 --> 00:25:50,808
Do you think that's true?

455
00:25:50,877 --> 00:25:52,476
I hope not.

456
00:25:52,545 --> 00:25:57,715
Well, whatever happens,
don't let him be right.

457
00:26:03,723 --> 00:26:07,992
I think you should go get some pizza.

458
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,361
Okay.

459
00:26:17,437 --> 00:26:18,836
Food run.

460
00:26:18,905 --> 00:26:23,007
Listen, I wish we had time
to talk this through,

461
00:26:23,075 --> 00:26:25,409
but ultimately,
I know you'd agree with me.

462
00:26:25,478 --> 00:26:27,778
What are you talking about?

463
00:26:27,847 --> 00:26:30,481
Ahh, ahh, oh, my wards.

464
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,749
I'm sorry.

465
00:26:31,818 --> 00:26:34,885
Why, why are you doing this to me?

466
00:26:34,954 --> 00:26:38,088
After everything Julia's been through,

467
00:26:38,157 --> 00:26:39,623
I can't make her do this.

468
00:26:39,692 --> 00:26:41,792
Do what?

469
00:26:43,963 --> 00:26:47,264
This is very good.

470
00:26:47,333 --> 00:26:48,065
Tea?

471
00:26:48,134 --> 00:26:52,002
I don't have time.

472
00:26:52,071 --> 00:26:54,638
Ah, brilliant, the shortcut there...

473
00:26:54,707 --> 00:26:57,007
I don't have time.

474
00:26:59,011 --> 00:27:02,646
I understood everything,
and now it's fading like a dream

475
00:27:02,715 --> 00:27:04,949
that you woke me from.

476
00:27:05,017 --> 00:27:06,550
Why can't I do magic?

477
00:27:06,619 --> 00:27:08,118
You're newborn again.

478
00:27:08,187 --> 00:27:10,087
You must crawl then walk.

479
00:27:10,156 --> 00:27:11,489
How long?

480
00:27:11,557 --> 00:27:13,123
What's the rush?

481
00:27:14,527 --> 00:27:18,696
I'm stuck in this...
this oily, disgusting cage,

482
00:27:18,764 --> 00:27:21,265
and I... I can't even fucking see.
I can't do anything.

483
00:27:21,334 --> 00:27:23,174
On the contrary,
you're finally in a position

484
00:27:23,202 --> 00:27:25,636
- to do something interesting.
- Fuck you, what do you know?

485
00:27:25,705 --> 00:27:30,875
I know, as niffin, you care
about nothing but your own mind,

486
00:27:30,943 --> 00:27:33,644
so congratulations, a perfect life

487
00:27:33,713 --> 00:27:38,082
with zero meaning. Now as human...

488
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:40,751
Humans are weak pieces of shit.

489
00:27:50,196 --> 00:27:53,898
Do you know what magic is?

490
00:27:53,966 --> 00:27:56,934
Energy capable of making
this shithole world

491
00:27:57,003 --> 00:28:00,838
one fractional speck less unbearable

492
00:28:00,907 --> 00:28:04,842
because we shits try so fucking hard,

493
00:28:04,911 --> 00:28:09,313
and that... that is not weakness.
Believe me.

494
00:28:09,382 --> 00:28:12,449
You don't like this world?
Good, you see its faults.

495
00:28:12,518 --> 00:28:18,122
It gives you focus and solitude
to actually fix it.

496
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,697
Adderall, to fortify you.

497
00:28:26,766 --> 00:28:29,466
Makes you write like Tolstoy.

498
00:28:29,535 --> 00:28:32,870
Don't make face.

499
00:28:32,939 --> 00:28:35,039
Drugs are fun.

500
00:28:45,151 --> 00:28:47,251
Hey, I wasn't sure what kind you wanted,

501
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,254
so, I don't know, I...

502
00:28:55,328 --> 00:28:56,961
Oh, my God.

503
00:29:00,967 --> 00:29:03,334
He made... he made me.

504
00:29:03,402 --> 00:29:04,735
What?

505
00:29:04,804 --> 00:29:07,538
He made me do the ritual.

506
00:29:07,607 --> 00:29:09,740
Collect his... his power.

507
00:29:11,811 --> 00:29:13,243
Oh, my God.

508
00:29:14,981 --> 00:29:18,716
Hey, you get yourself cleaned up,

509
00:29:18,784 --> 00:29:21,885
and I'll handle the rest, okay?

510
00:29:28,928 --> 00:29:31,161
There you are, you son of a bitch.

511
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,463
Ah.

512
00:29:42,241 --> 00:29:44,108
Sylvia, where are you? Sylvia!

513
00:29:44,176 --> 00:29:45,376
Sylvia, read it when you get back.

514
00:29:45,444 --> 00:29:47,077
We gotta go.

515
00:29:48,881 --> 00:29:49,980
You betrayed Ember.

516
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:51,548
Well, I wouldn't call it that.

517
00:29:51,617 --> 00:29:53,017
I just had no choice.

518
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:54,618
It was a matter of survival.

519
00:29:54,687 --> 00:29:57,454
A condition of the agreement
I made with Martin Chatwin.

520
00:29:57,523 --> 00:29:59,323
He had Fillory
booby-trapped to the gills.

521
00:29:59,392 --> 00:30:00,824
He was about to fillet me.

522
00:30:00,893 --> 00:30:04,395
So you faked your own death,
and you moved to Vancouver?

523
00:30:04,463 --> 00:30:06,063
Well, if I had to leave Fillory,

524
00:30:06,132 --> 00:30:08,065
Canada was the obvious second choice.

525
00:30:08,134 --> 00:30:12,336
What is it that you enjoy about Fillory?

526
00:30:12,405 --> 00:30:16,140
Uh... it reminds me of a time

527
00:30:16,208 --> 00:30:18,676
before I realized
how shitty being an adult is.

528
00:30:18,744 --> 00:30:20,144
And there's opium in the air.

529
00:30:20,212 --> 00:30:22,613
And how do you feel about turtles?

530
00:30:22,682 --> 00:30:24,348
Indifferent, I guess.

531
00:30:24,417 --> 00:30:25,649
Not a fan.

532
00:30:25,718 --> 00:30:28,118
Would you sleep easier
knowing that your entire world

533
00:30:28,187 --> 00:30:30,854
rested on the back of one or several?

534
00:30:30,923 --> 00:30:33,023
What... why are you asking?

535
00:30:33,092 --> 00:30:35,492
Because as visitors to my previous work,

536
00:30:35,561 --> 00:30:40,097
you make for an excellent
focus group for my new world.

537
00:30:40,166 --> 00:30:43,067
It's something I've been building.

538
00:30:43,135 --> 00:30:44,735
Testing a few things out.

539
00:30:44,804 --> 00:30:47,971
It's more of a pocket world, really.

540
00:30:49,675 --> 00:30:52,109
I call it Cuba.

541
00:30:52,178 --> 00:30:53,610
That's already a place.

542
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:54,712
- Is it?
- Yes.

543
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,580
- You're sure?
- Absolutely sure.

544
00:30:56,649 --> 00:30:59,450
Oh, damn it.

545
00:30:59,518 --> 00:31:02,219
Look, this is all very interesting-ish,

546
00:31:02,288 --> 00:31:04,588
but I have a kingdom to fix.

547
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:13,864
You were never meant to fix Fillory.

548
00:31:13,933 --> 00:31:14,965
Of course I was.

549
00:31:15,034 --> 00:31:16,234
No, you were meant to entertain

550
00:31:16,268 --> 00:31:19,036
like some reality TV star.

551
00:31:19,105 --> 00:31:21,805
Oh, Ember must've found you so boring.

552
00:31:21,874 --> 00:31:23,440
Boring?

553
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:27,745
Fillory was created out of
the unification of opposites.

554
00:31:27,813 --> 00:31:31,215
Ember is a creature
of entropy and chaos...

555
00:31:31,283 --> 00:31:34,118
And you have every season
of "Law & Order" on DVD.

556
00:31:34,186 --> 00:31:37,454
The most perfect show in creation.

557
00:31:37,523 --> 00:31:40,791
When Ember and I were together,
there was balance.

558
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,860
Without me, chaos reigns.

559
00:31:42,928 --> 00:31:44,895
Give up, Children of Earth.

560
00:31:44,964 --> 00:31:46,964
Fillory cannot be ruled.

561
00:31:55,908 --> 00:31:56,940
Whoa.

562
00:31:57,009 --> 00:31:58,509
Come on.

563
00:31:58,577 --> 00:32:00,377
Stop worrying about me.
Fucking travel out already.

564
00:32:00,446 --> 00:32:02,212
Look, I will carry your ass back by...

565
00:32:02,281 --> 00:32:04,181
You don't get it!

566
00:32:05,284 --> 00:32:08,685
I don't make it back to the rope.

567
00:32:08,754 --> 00:32:10,788
My book didn't have a blank spot.

568
00:32:10,856 --> 00:32:12,389
So what?

569
00:32:12,458 --> 00:32:14,191
What happened to "there's
no fate but what we make"?

570
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,994
If you carry me back,
you die too, Penny.

571
00:32:17,062 --> 00:32:18,495
I read it.

572
00:32:18,564 --> 00:32:21,765
Leaving me is the only way
you have a chance.

573
00:32:31,777 --> 00:32:33,143
- Penny.
- I got your book.

574
00:32:33,212 --> 00:32:34,845
What the hell?

575
00:32:34,914 --> 00:32:36,180
Penny? Oh, my...

576
00:32:36,248 --> 00:32:38,148
Help!

577
00:32:38,217 --> 00:32:39,817
Give me good news, Rafe.

578
00:32:39,885 --> 00:32:42,619
Unfortunately, returning
from the Fairy Realm

579
00:32:42,688 --> 00:32:44,788
is, uh, problematic.

580
00:32:44,857 --> 00:32:48,458
All I have is this tincture
that takes you there.

581
00:32:48,527 --> 00:32:49,927
Why would I drink this?

582
00:32:49,995 --> 00:32:51,962
Then I'm stuck there
with Margo, and you can't

583
00:32:52,031 --> 00:32:53,263
get either of us out.

584
00:32:53,332 --> 00:32:55,098
Prince Ess of Loria, Your Majesty.

585
00:32:55,167 --> 00:32:56,600
Where's my father?

586
00:32:56,669 --> 00:32:59,002
Hey, I don't think we've formally met.

587
00:32:59,071 --> 00:33:00,370
Cut the shit.

588
00:33:00,439 --> 00:33:02,439
I will tear this place apart
if I have to.

589
00:33:02,508 --> 00:33:08,245
So uh, funny story, uh,
your... your dad is actually

590
00:33:08,314 --> 00:33:09,880
a rat person now.

591
00:33:09,949 --> 00:33:12,049
- Do it.
- He's...

592
00:33:25,764 --> 00:33:27,497
Break it down.

593
00:33:28,901 --> 00:33:30,868
Hakuna matata has failed me.

594
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:38,555
It pains me, but I simply
cannot go back to Fillory.

595
00:33:39,062 --> 00:33:43,165
So you're just gonna let Ember
turn Fillory into a telenovela?

596
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,667
Well, you don't understand how he is.

597
00:33:45,702 --> 00:33:47,803
He pitted animals against each other

598
00:33:47,838 --> 00:33:50,906
by offering only the sexiest
the ability to speak.

599
00:33:50,941 --> 00:33:53,475
Centaurs?
Drunk off his chair, obviously.

600
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:57,145
When he gets snacky, he talks
about turning humans into rats.

601
00:33:57,181 --> 00:33:59,681
Holy shit.

602
00:33:59,716 --> 00:34:01,483
Ember turned everybody into rats.

603
00:34:01,518 --> 00:34:02,918
Oh, he finally did it.

604
00:34:02,953 --> 00:34:05,086
That's been on his bucket list
for centuries.

605
00:34:05,122 --> 00:34:07,222
Ember cock-blocked me.

606
00:34:07,257 --> 00:34:10,192
You are a god of Fillory.

607
00:34:10,227 --> 00:34:12,494
Why are you just sitting here
and letting your brother

608
00:34:12,529 --> 00:34:13,995
shit all over it?

609
00:34:14,031 --> 00:34:15,564
You let The Beast happen.

610
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,000
You shut out a child who needed shelter,

611
00:34:19,036 --> 00:34:22,904
and when he became a monster, you ran.

612
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,906
You hate chaos?

613
00:34:24,942 --> 00:34:29,077
Then fix the chaos that you created.

614
00:34:34,351 --> 00:34:35,851
You're right.

615
00:34:35,886 --> 00:34:38,820
But some mistakes cannot be repaired.

616
00:34:38,856 --> 00:34:41,389
And from those, we must move forward.

617
00:34:41,425 --> 00:34:43,458
And I shall try to avoid repeating

618
00:34:43,494 --> 00:34:46,862
such mistakes in my new world.

619
00:34:46,897 --> 00:34:48,630
Fine...

620
00:34:50,701 --> 00:34:52,033
Then give us the clock.

621
00:34:52,069 --> 00:34:54,302
Why do you care?

622
00:34:54,338 --> 00:34:56,204
Fillory's on its last legs.

623
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,274
Everything you've said tells me
Ember is tired of the game.

624
00:34:59,309 --> 00:35:01,843
He's likely to smash the place
like a toddler.

625
00:35:01,879 --> 00:35:04,813
Trust me, that'll be it. End of Fillory.

626
00:35:04,848 --> 00:35:06,581
And don't get sentimental.

627
00:35:06,617 --> 00:35:08,216
We aren't ready to walk away yet.

628
00:35:08,252 --> 00:35:10,385
We know you still love Fillory.

629
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:14,489
You literally have
every memento to prove it.

630
00:35:14,525 --> 00:35:16,224
If you can't fix it or won't save it,

631
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:19,961
then let us try.

632
00:35:19,997 --> 00:35:21,930
Please.

633
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,534
You love Fillory.

634
00:35:25,569 --> 00:35:27,769
It's my home.

635
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:33,975
Then the clock is yours, Your Majesty.

636
00:35:34,011 --> 00:35:37,045
But heed my warning.

637
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:42,250
Nothing entertains Ember more
than a whimsical death.

638
00:36:05,609 --> 00:36:07,375
- Hey.
- Hey.

639
00:36:07,411 --> 00:36:10,812
How's Penny? Still alive?

640
00:36:10,847 --> 00:36:13,515
I could've worded that better.

641
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:16,885
Yeah.

642
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,588
They cleared out the whole infirmary.

643
00:36:19,623 --> 00:36:21,623
Something about radiation.

644
00:36:21,658 --> 00:36:22,924
That can't be good.

645
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,659
And not much I can do about it
right now.

646
00:36:24,695 --> 00:36:26,795
So you've got time.

647
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:29,965
Kill it with me killing Reynard.

648
00:36:30,934 --> 00:36:32,867
Good news, found a spell in here.

649
00:36:32,903 --> 00:36:36,471
Turns metal objects
into god-piercing weapons.

650
00:36:36,506 --> 00:36:40,909
And if it can be anything, gun, right?

651
00:36:40,944 --> 00:36:45,647
But it took everything John
gave us just to make one bullet.

652
00:36:45,682 --> 00:36:49,150
So we've got one shot.

653
00:37:03,133 --> 00:37:03,965
Fall back.

654
00:37:04,001 --> 00:37:07,435
Don't inhale the... smoke...

655
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:27,822
Oh, shit.

656
00:37:27,858 --> 00:37:30,959
Luckily, I'm a pro. Come on, come on.

657
00:37:34,031 --> 00:37:34,929
Fen?

658
00:37:34,965 --> 00:37:37,532
- Josh, you can see me?
- Fen!

659
00:37:37,567 --> 00:37:40,502
Josh, help me! Help me, please, hurry!

660
00:37:43,707 --> 00:37:47,275
Tick, tell my story.

661
00:38:08,298 --> 00:38:09,698
Well, this is it.

662
00:38:11,001 --> 00:38:13,334
The sign Reynard's been waiting for.

663
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:15,403
Come on out, asshole.

664
00:38:15,439 --> 00:38:20,675
Something feels so right about
tricking him with goddess omens.

665
00:38:20,711 --> 00:38:21,810
Amen.

666
00:38:21,845 --> 00:38:23,144
Let's get scarce.

667
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,679
Let's go.

668
00:38:40,097 --> 00:38:41,763
I know you're here.

669
00:38:41,798 --> 00:38:43,631
There he is.

670
00:38:43,667 --> 00:38:46,634
The lightning, the wind...

671
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:49,637
Always were a drama queen.

672
00:38:50,807 --> 00:38:53,675
I can't get a clear shot.

673
00:38:58,949 --> 00:39:00,281
Go on the other side.

674
00:39:00,317 --> 00:39:03,284
- I'll get you a clear shot.
- Kady!

675
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,719
Hey!

676
00:39:06,523 --> 00:39:08,256
I should have known.

677
00:39:08,291 --> 00:39:09,390
Where's Julia?

678
00:39:09,426 --> 00:39:12,761
Why don't you ask me where John is?

679
00:39:14,731 --> 00:39:16,564
What did you do?

680
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,533
Nothing he wasn't asking for.

681
00:39:18,568 --> 00:39:21,469
Hated you so much,
he begged me to kill him.

682
00:39:21,505 --> 00:39:22,771
You bitch!

683
00:39:22,806 --> 00:39:23,772
You liar!

684
00:39:35,685 --> 00:39:38,119
Kady, what...?

685
00:39:54,941 --> 00:39:57,035
It's you.

686
00:39:58,795 --> 00:40:03,231
You ignored us, and now you're here?

687
00:40:03,267 --> 00:40:05,934
All of a sudden?

688
00:40:05,969 --> 00:40:07,902
Why?

689
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:11,406
To ask you to spare his life.

690
00:40:11,441 --> 00:40:12,741
I don't understand.

691
00:40:12,776 --> 00:40:15,610
Why do you care?

692
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:17,946
He's my son.

693
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:24,819
Did you know what he was doing?

694
00:40:27,924 --> 00:40:30,759
Of course you did.

695
00:40:30,794 --> 00:40:33,194
He raped me.

696
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,096
Your son.

697
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:38,933
I'd be sobbing
and telling you every detail,

698
00:40:38,969 --> 00:40:40,969
but I lost my Shade in the abortion,

699
00:40:41,004 --> 00:40:45,307
so you're just gonna have to
take my word for it.

700
00:40:45,342 --> 00:40:46,908
Let me deal with him.

701
00:40:46,943 --> 00:40:49,110
Why would I trust you?
Come the fuck on, lady.

702
00:40:49,146 --> 00:40:51,680
There are consequences
to killing a god, Julia.

703
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:54,783
I lost my friends. I lost everything.

704
00:40:54,818 --> 00:40:58,520
He turned me into a monster.

705
00:40:58,555 --> 00:41:01,156
You're a survivor.

706
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:06,161
You're still capable of mercy, Julia.

707
00:41:06,196 --> 00:41:09,698
Don't let him rob you of that.

708
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:21,176
It's your choice.

709
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:52,140
I am so disappointed
with what you've done.

710
00:41:52,175 --> 00:41:56,277
You left me. You left me.

711
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:59,481
Well, I am back.

712
00:41:59,516 --> 00:42:02,250
And it's time to go.

713
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:06,287
No, no!

714
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:11,493
How could you do this after
everything we've been through?

715
00:42:11,528 --> 00:42:13,828
I killed John for this.

716
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,096
It was the right thing.

717
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:18,266
How the hell would you know that?

718
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:21,236
Sorry, Kady.

719
00:42:45,929 --> 00:42:48,530
Our Lady sent me.

720
00:43:08,618 --> 00:43:11,085
Hey, I'm sorry I hurt you.

721
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,226
I tried to do the right thing.

722
00:43:22,199 --> 00:43:23,865
But I'm not sorry that you're alive,

723
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,734
and maybe that makes me selfish,
but I...

724
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:31,873
The world's a better place
when you're in it.

725
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:37,812
Say the word, and I'll stay.

726
00:43:40,584 --> 00:43:43,251
If you want me to leave you
alone for a while

727
00:43:43,286 --> 00:43:45,787
and figure this out on your own,
I mean, let's face it.

728
00:43:45,822 --> 00:43:48,056
There's probably nothing
that you can't figure out.

729
00:43:48,091 --> 00:43:50,792
You are Alice Quinn.

730
00:44:00,837 --> 00:44:04,572
Okay, so the plan so far is,

731
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:07,008
find a way to stay in Fillory

732
00:44:07,043 --> 00:44:09,110
and never get banished again.

733
00:44:09,145 --> 00:44:13,014
Find a way to stop Ember or
drive him out or, I don't know,

734
00:44:13,049 --> 00:44:16,117
anything but letting him
get so bored he decides

735
00:44:16,152 --> 00:44:18,653
to just shake the Etch A Sketch
and end our kingdom,

736
00:44:18,688 --> 00:44:21,256
everyone I care about, and
the well spring in the process.

737
00:44:21,291 --> 00:44:24,058
So, thoughts?

738
00:44:24,094 --> 00:44:27,328
You're talking about conquering Fillory.

739
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:28,696
For its own good.

740
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:33,468
Your plan is the exact same
as The Beast's was.

741
00:44:33,503 --> 00:44:35,403
Shit.

742
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:40,967
Do you got a better idea?
