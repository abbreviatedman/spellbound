1
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:03,535
<i>- Previously on
"The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:05,437
- Fuck!
- I'm so sorry.

3
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:07,339
- It's Reynard.
- He's back.

4
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:09,008
Wait, I am pregnant.

5
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:11,477
- I wasn't the only one
he raped that night,

6
00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:14,346
but I was the only one
who got pregnant.

7
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,782
- This is exorcism,
you understand?

8
00:00:16,784 --> 00:00:19,084
- Did it work?
- Is it gone?

9
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:22,454
- In the center of your being,
there's a tiny beating heart.

10
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:25,557
It's called a shade.
It's what makes you feel.

11
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:28,227
The pain will burn you
till there's nothing.

12
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:31,530
- There was a complication.
- Her shade, it's gone.

13
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,298
- I feel light,

14
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,035
like a million pound weight's
off my chest.

15
00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:37,536
Say we get the perfect spell,

16
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,538
think about the energy
it'd take to work it.

17
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,107
Dana's baby... his son.

18
00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:43,575
- You know, there is
a ton of lore on demigods.

19
00:00:43,577 --> 00:00:45,310
They're powerful
in their own right.

20
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,578
- We need to find him.

21
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,313
- As for Loria...

22
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:50,249
- some 8,000 troops
are headed to the border.

23
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:51,517
- So we're totally outnumbered.

24
00:00:51,519 --> 00:00:53,819
- And of course,
our preparation is affected

25
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:57,089
by the continued unsteadiness
of the wellspring.

26
00:00:57,091 --> 00:00:59,058
- Looks like...
- A major drought's hit.

27
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:04,096
- You can't even get out
of this shoddy little magician.

28
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:06,432
Free yourself, then find me.

29
00:01:06,434 --> 00:01:08,801
- Alice, we can talk about this.
- Just shut up! Shut up!

30
00:01:08,803 --> 00:01:11,403
This is your body trying
to hold a niffin inside it.

31
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:14,540
You can't...
Not for much longer,

32
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:16,375
or it's gonna kill us both.

33
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,851
Seriously, you guys,
I'm in a cage.

34
00:01:25,853 --> 00:01:29,455
You think this is, uh,
a tad redundant?

35
00:01:29,457 --> 00:01:31,423
- Protocol.
- For werewolves.

36
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,292
- Okay, technically, I have

37
00:01:33,294 --> 00:01:36,295
sexually transmitted
lycanthropy... a very mild case.

38
00:01:36,297 --> 00:01:38,430
Would've been cool
to actually fully wolf out.

39
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:39,832
You know...

40
00:01:39,834 --> 00:01:41,300
Either way,
it's totally curable.

41
00:01:41,302 --> 00:01:44,570
- Treatable.
- There is no actual cure.

42
00:01:44,572 --> 00:01:48,207
- Well, silver bullet.

43
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:49,608
- Hey, don't go through my bag.

44
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,112
- Quentin, you're dying.

45
00:01:53,114 --> 00:01:54,580
- Yeah, well, aren't we all?

46
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:56,348
- You are dying quickly.

47
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,418
You cannot keep this thing
inside you much longer.

48
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,853
- Well, I can't let her go.

49
00:02:00,855 --> 00:02:02,855
- Which is why you must box her.

50
00:02:02,857 --> 00:02:04,490
- I'm not doing that to Alice.

51
00:02:04,492 --> 00:02:06,325
- Quentin, there is
no more Alice.

52
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:09,461
- This is uncharted territory.
- Nobody knows.

53
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,130
- Well, I know that
you will be dead in days

54
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:12,698
if you don't
rid yourself of her.

55
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:15,534
- May I help you steal from me?

56
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:17,703
- Nope, I got it.

57
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:22,474
Good luck with all your shit.

58
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:29,515
These damn brownouts.

59
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:34,653
- We may be
the least trusted monarchs

60
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:38,223
in the history of Fillory.

61
00:02:38,225 --> 00:02:40,559
Thank god
they don't have polls here.

62
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,534
- That's the third brownout
this week.

63
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:51,570
- If we don't fix the wellspring
soon, your majesty...

64
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:54,173
- one problem at a time, okay?

65
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:56,508
Our soldiers are
deserting us in protest,

66
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,244
thanks to Julia
committing tree genocide.

67
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:00,679
- Pardon me, your majesty.

68
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,514
For the official records,
may I suggest

69
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,217
a slightly less incendiary term?

70
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:06,919
Perhaps "arbicide"?

71
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:08,620
- Sure, if you can
also recommend

72
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:10,956
how we fight a war
without an army.

73
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:18,730
- Your majesty,
there is one option...

74
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:22,334
- A rather obscure law, based...
- less words.

75
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:24,736
- One-on-one combat.

76
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:27,272
Between monarchs.

77
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:28,707
- A duel?
- El...

78
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,976
- with Ess's dad?
- He's gotta be at least 50.

79
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:32,744
And I'm pretty buff
from all the living

80
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:34,980
without technology
or decent wine.

81
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:36,415
- Slow down.

82
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:38,483
- Is there any rule
about not using magic?

83
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:41,653
- No, your majesty.
- Highness, if I may,

84
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:43,789
there is a reason
we haven't brought up this, uh,

85
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,457
option before,

86
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:48,694
especially since magic
is not completely dependable.

87
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:51,496
Simply put, you're likely to...

88
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:53,465
Well... Die.

89
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:56,668
- Mm-hmm.
- Tick, if I did this,

90
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,704
how popular would I be?

91
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:02,407
- No king has ever volunteered

92
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,009
for one-on-one combat.

93
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:06,712
If you were to prevail,
you would easily be

94
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:09,982
the greatest leader
in Fillorian history.

95
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:11,350
- The greatest.
- The greatest.

96
00:04:11,352 --> 00:04:12,584
- God,

97
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,520
he's already seeing the statues.

98
00:04:15,522 --> 00:04:17,489
- I hereby decree...

99
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:21,360
Rulers done gonna rumble.

100
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:35,507
- Eliot's the king of all this?

101
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:39,044
- Yeah, looking for rock-solid
proof there's no justice, that.

102
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:41,847
- Even this dungeon's nicer than
any place I lived as a kid...

103
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:44,316
Oh, except for my uncle's BMW.

104
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:46,518
Would've been even nicer
if he'd actually been my uncle.

105
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,489
- Don't be fooled
by the high gloss.

106
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:52,057
This place sucks.

107
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:57,829
- Hey.
- What's up?

108
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:59,765
- We found Reynard's son.

109
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:01,500
- So this is a breakout.

110
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:03,769
- Why are you in here anyway?
- I killed trees.

111
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:06,638
- Seriously.
- That could talk.

112
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,508
- They have talking trees here?

113
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,676
- Not anymore.

114
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:15,080
So what's Reynard's son like?

115
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:16,882
- I guarantee
you won't believe it.

116
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:20,385
Let's go.

117
00:05:26,793 --> 00:05:28,627
What the fuck?

118
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:31,663
- He's marking his territory.

119
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,865
- Hey, I refuse to be shamed.

120
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:36,468
- Didn't you hear
what friar Joseph said?

121
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,470
Not all niffins are the same.

122
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:39,905
I'm not gonna go
on some killing spree

123
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:42,641
anymore than he would.

124
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:46,545
Q...
Don't you believe me?

125
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:48,814
- I believe you believe you.

126
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:51,817
- Sorry?

127
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:54,853
- I'm not talking to you.

128
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,558
- I just want to do
what Joseph does.

129
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,127
Please.
Beautiful, high-level magic.

130
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:05,364
- I'm not letting you loose.

131
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:07,632
It's bad for the world.

132
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:12,437
I'm not boxing you.

133
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:16,842
I don't want to know
a world without Alice.

134
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:20,846
- Keep this up,
and you won't have to.

135
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:23,415
We'll both be dead.

136
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:24,916
Good plan.

137
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:33,658
Eliot...

138
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,794
- The intel I'm getting
on king Idri

139
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:39,164
and the protocols of dueling...
Not good.

140
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:41,600
I mean, you ever even touched
a sword before today?

141
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:44,836
- No, but... Magician.

142
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:46,505
- Well, sword fighting spells,

143
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:49,574
of which there are only two
anyone knows of,

144
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,576
take months to master.

145
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:54,646
- Why? It's a giant
butter knife.

146
00:06:56,950 --> 00:07:00,585
It's all the variables
in any given match.

147
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,821
It's almost infinite.

148
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:05,891
- I mean, sure, you could
slap together spell,

149
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:09,694
maybe get four
or five good moves.

150
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:13,765
- Which brings us to thing two.
- How many things are there?

151
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:18,603
- Look, king Idri
has fought 14 duels.

152
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,505
All opponents dead.

153
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,612
<i>- Senator Gaines' rise
has been described</i>

154
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,014
<i>as nothing less than meteoric.</i>

155
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:31,583
- Reynard's son is John Gaines?

156
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:34,886
- You know him?
- I mean, I know who he is.

157
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:36,855
He's on rails
to the White House.

158
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:39,057
- I hit one of his rallies,
did a psychic scan.

159
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:41,226
Dude believes
every word he says.

160
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:52,037
<i>- I believe that everyone is
born with a flame of goodness,</i>

161
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:56,541
<i>and if my light or yours go out,</i>

162
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:59,611
<i>remember, we're not alone
in this world.</i>

163
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,250
- See?
- Wow.

164
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:08,987
He's the perfect demigod
spokesmodel of absolute evil.

165
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:11,990
- Who's kinda hot as shit.

166
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:14,025
- What?
- Sorry.

167
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:16,561
Look, he's not even my type,
obviously; It's... it's weird.

168
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,163
- Dude has more magic
coming off him

169
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:21,099
than every magician
on earth combined

170
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:23,602
and knows not one thing
about magic.

171
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:28,573
- Well, he's sure gonna.

172
00:08:39,585 --> 00:08:41,586
- How's the battle prep?

173
00:08:41,588 --> 00:08:43,622
- If someone had told me
a year ago

174
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:45,924
that I'd be venting to my wife,

175
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:52,097
while preparing to do battle on
behalf of my mythical kingdom...

176
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:54,165
I'd have done a lot more drugs.

177
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:55,967
- I have something
that might help.

178
00:08:55,969 --> 00:08:59,304
- Great, depending on
what your definition of help is.

179
00:08:59,306 --> 00:09:04,009
- I know I haven't always
given you reason to trust me.

180
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:07,012
My grandpa forged this sword
for a high king

181
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:08,613
who vanished without
ever claiming it.

182
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:11,616
Since then, my family's
been saving it

183
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:14,286
for someone truly worthy.

184
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:17,155
- It's beautiful, but
I'm not sure it actually helps.

185
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:18,990
I'll never learn
a spell in time.

186
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:22,561
- It was made for a king,
as was the accompanying spell.

187
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:28,233
- And sword spells
take weeks to master.

188
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,268
- Not when it's written
for a king.

189
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,638
My grandpa was the royal
family's favorite sword Smith

190
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,141
because he knew they were,
uh, too...

191
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:40,011
- Too lazy to learn?
- Too... Preoccupied

192
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:42,981
with matters of state
for busywork.

193
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:46,051
With this spell and this blade,

194
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:48,019
you will be a master swordsman.

195
00:09:49,356 --> 00:09:52,657
Insert weak double entendre
I'd have to explain.

196
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:54,359
- Sorry?

197
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:57,162
"Praise ember's strength

198
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:58,730
"and umber's wisdom.

199
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:01,132
"Bring unto me
the lifeblood knowledge

200
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:04,035
of all masters of the blade
who have come before."

201
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:11,009
Fen...

202
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:15,947
Fen, I actually feel
marginally less fucked now.

203
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:20,085
- All my life,
I've put my family first.

204
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:23,388
Now that's you and our baby.

205
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:29,227
- I'll really try
not to die again.

206
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:32,330
I'd really appreciate that.

207
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,810
- No, no, no, stop...
- Hold on... hey, Becky.

208
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,746
Security?

209
00:10:47,748 --> 00:10:50,148
- Security?
- It's not working.

210
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:53,385
- All right.

211
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:57,188
Whatever this is, stop.
Tell me what you want.

212
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,659
- Man, you're good.
- Mm-hmm.

213
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,827
- Let's get to it.

214
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:08,433
Magic is real.

215
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,070
- Whoa,
whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, hey.

216
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,115
Okay.

217
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:27,152
Okay, is this
some kind of a gag?

218
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:29,688
Is this a publicity stunt
for a TV show?

219
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,756
- We're magicians
being hunted by an evil god,

220
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:33,224
and so are you.

221
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:36,428
- Listen, obviously
you guys believe this,

222
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,697
- and... and I respect that.
- Bullshit.

223
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:40,165
- No, it is not bullshit.
- It is... okay.

224
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:41,833
- This'll take forever.
- It's not like

225
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:44,335
- we need him alive anyway.
- Jesus, what the fuck, Julia?

226
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:47,072
- We don't need him.
- We need his energy.

227
00:11:47,074 --> 00:11:49,174
- No.
- You're born, huge energy;

228
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:51,876
you die, bigger energy,
especially a demigod.

229
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:54,446
That is what we are
after here, people, the energy.

230
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:56,715
Right now, he's just a skin sack
hiding it from us.

231
00:11:56,717 --> 00:12:01,252
- Okay, you need something
to hold that energy.

232
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:03,188
- Like this?
- Jesus.

233
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,356
- Oh, my god.
- You planned this all along.

234
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:06,858
- All right, all of you,

235
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,460
get the fuck out
of my office now!

236
00:12:08,462 --> 00:12:10,395
I won't die here tonight.

237
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:13,431
I will not die here!

238
00:12:15,802 --> 00:12:17,736
Oh, shit.

239
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:23,074
He's okay.

240
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,809
He just fainted.

241
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:26,311
- Hey!
- Whoa! No.

242
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:30,482
We are not,<i> not,</i>
killing a U.S. senator.

243
00:12:32,219 --> 00:12:35,253
But we will commit a felony
almost as stupid.

244
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:39,758
- Mm-Kay, sloth,

245
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,459
you're the most honest one
on the damn council,

246
00:12:41,461 --> 00:12:44,963
so I'm counting on you to not
kiss my ass or cover yours.

247
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:47,799
We've got a sword spell,
so yay us.

248
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:49,768
But we need
the wellspring to work.

249
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:53,138
There can't be one brownout
or blip during the duel.

250
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:57,108
So straight-up,
how do we guarantee that?

251
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:02,547
- It's too...
- What?

252
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:05,817
Um...

253
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:07,919
- There is something,

254
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:10,188
but we urge you not to do it.

255
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,991
- Tell me.
- Petition the fairies?

256
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:16,528
- Fairies?

257
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,998
Do I know about the fairies?

258
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,268
- They exist outside our realm.

259
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:27,272
They can be contacted,
and they have great powers.

260
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:29,107
- Well, can they fix
the wellspring?

261
00:13:29,109 --> 00:13:31,910
Almost certainly.

262
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:33,845
- Guys? The fuck?

263
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:38,349
- Uh, fairies are notoriously...

264
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:40,985
- Mercurial?
- Have ya met your king?

265
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:45,223
- They make complex deals
with steep prices and...

266
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:47,125
- yeah, get me a meeting.

267
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:50,028
- One has to contact
their ambassador,

268
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:54,032
a human, which can sometimes
take days, even weeks.

269
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:56,201
- Well, then chop-chop.

270
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:59,571
And never keep information
from me again, okay?

271
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:01,039
- Yes, your highness.

272
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,541
- You, sloth, you read me?

273
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,151
- What?
- Nothing.

274
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,323
Is that that senator dude?

275
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:20,058
- You think we kidnapped
a U.S. senator

276
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,860
and stuffed him in a closet?

277
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:24,262
- No.
- Jesus, of course not.

278
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:25,897
- Okay.

279
00:14:25,899 --> 00:14:28,233
- How'd you get him
past the wards?

280
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:31,169
Hey, does one of you
have an alumni key?

281
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:34,205
So cool.
Um, can I borrow it sometime?

282
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:36,174
There's this really hot...
I'd love to sneak her...

283
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:39,010
- ah, vodka Gibson, four onions.

284
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:42,180
- Yeah, right away.

285
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:43,214
- So what do we do
when he wakes up

286
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,916
and starts kicking the door?

287
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:47,919
- Whatever it is has
nothing to do with you.

288
00:14:47,921 --> 00:14:50,054
Stay away from him.

289
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,189
- Or?

290
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:53,157
- No, you don't want
to go there.

291
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:58,196
Pretty sure we're already there.

292
00:14:58,198 --> 00:15:00,131
- Enough.

293
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,068
I'll keep an eye on the senator.

294
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,104
- She's psychotic.
- Look, she's being

295
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:09,107
a little... Extreme, yeah,

296
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:12,443
but she's got her reasons, okay?
Just trust me.

297
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:15,380
- I know Julia.
- That's not Julia.

298
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:18,149
Even she knows that.

299
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:20,231
The only person who doesn't seem
to know that is you.

300
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,463
- Looks good.

301
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:34,666
- What's wrong?
- Wrong?

302
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:39,671
- Your face...
- I'm an obsessive fan, so tell.

303
00:15:39,673 --> 00:15:41,506
- Thank you, Soren.

304
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,677
The sword's good.

305
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:48,313
The spell makes me great,
but great enough?

306
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:49,981
If I lose, forget me.

307
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:52,083
All of you are dead
or imprisoned.

308
00:15:56,957 --> 00:15:59,991
Why didn't I see
how huge this is?

309
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:02,994
I'm...

310
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:05,196
I'm scared...

311
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:07,198
For all of us.

312
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,134
- You know what
I'm thinking about?

313
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,502
That video you showed me

314
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:14,272
of your high school
production of "Les Mis."

315
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:18,276
You were such a great Valjean.

316
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:19,978
- Ugh.

317
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,414
I was all right at the matinees.

318
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,416
Evenings I'd agree.

319
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:27,251
- I scaled the heights.
- Mm.

320
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:29,420
- But...

321
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:31,289
What's your point?

322
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:34,459
- Well, all this reading
we've been doing on war,

323
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:37,228
I keep coming across
soldiers who'd sing

324
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,297
before going into battle.

325
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:41,432
- To avoid throwing up
with fear?

326
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:44,268
- It built confidence, yes,

327
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:47,071
projected power,
destabilized the enemy.

328
00:16:47,073 --> 00:16:49,140
So give me.

329
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:50,508
- What?

330
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,310
- The big number.

331
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:56,314
I can't.

332
00:16:56,316 --> 00:17:00,184
I'll never remember
all the lyrics.

333
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,553
It's practically
the entire cast.

334
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,422
- Which is why...

335
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:08,292
Magic.

336
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:12,163
- No, I should practice.

337
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:14,198
- So move your ass and sing.

338
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,068
Beyoncé does,
which is why she's a boss.

339
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,237
- Mm-mm.
- Don't make me sing.

340
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,501
- Sorry,
I had to skip some verses.

341
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:58,369
They're great,
but they don't really apply

342
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:00,204
to our situation.

343
00:19:00,206 --> 00:19:02,273
- Oh, okay.

344
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:03,574
Gotcha.

345
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,687
- I'm confused.

346
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:25,523
- Is the duel not today?
- It's a metaphor.

347
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:27,725
- I love that show.
- You know it?

348
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:30,661
- Boarding school on earth.
- I played Javert.

349
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:34,432
- Typecasting.

350
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:39,403
- Praise ember's strength
and umber's wisdom.

351
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:40,671
Bring unto me
the lifeblood knowledge

352
00:20:40,673 --> 00:20:42,006
of all masters of the blade.

353
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:48,613
King Idri...

354
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:53,551
- King Eliot...

355
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:55,519
I'm sorry I have to kill you.

356
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:56,954
- I've died before.

357
00:20:56,956 --> 00:21:00,024
Doesn't seem to take with me.

358
00:21:00,026 --> 00:21:01,459
Shall we?

359
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:17,441
Ah!

360
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:32,690
- Okay, is he allowed
to do that?

361
00:21:32,692 --> 00:21:34,792
- Kings do whatever.

362
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,994
- Fine, he bitched out.
- It's over.

363
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:40,398
- It's over when
one ruler is dead.

364
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,500
Another favorite show of mine...

365
00:21:42,502 --> 00:21:44,702
"Into the woods."

366
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,950
- I cannot believe how
fucking boring this is.

367
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:05,890
You know I can see magic?

368
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:09,760
Not the kind that
you can do with your hands...

369
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:11,829
That stone age bullshit.

370
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:14,632
I can see pure magic

371
00:22:14,634 --> 00:22:19,337
in a thousand dimensions
all at once.

372
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:20,905
- You're not Quentin.

373
00:22:20,907 --> 00:22:24,041
- Get me out of here.

374
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:25,376
- Alice.

375
00:22:25,378 --> 00:22:27,845
- Quentin always said
you were smart.

376
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,647
- He said the same about you.

377
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:31,782
- Well, then,
between the two of us,

378
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:34,385
we should be able
to figure something out.

379
00:22:34,387 --> 00:22:36,854
- I'm not sure that's
what q would want.

380
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,923
- What do you want, Julia?

381
00:22:38,925 --> 00:22:42,860
What are you thinking?

382
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:46,497
Oh, I can almost see it...

383
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:50,401
Just like I can see
that your shade is gone,

384
00:22:50,403 --> 00:22:53,404
which is how I know that your...

385
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:57,041
Thoughts are pure, unencumbered.

386
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:59,710
I'm right, aren't I?

387
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:03,414
We both no life
is not clouded with regret,

388
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:06,817
need, sadness.

389
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:11,689
We both know life is
crystalline, clear, cold, sharp.

390
00:23:11,691 --> 00:23:13,824
- You...

391
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:16,427
He's bleeding.

392
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:18,863
- God, he's so weak.

393
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:35,546
<i>- John, I'm here.</i>

394
00:23:35,548 --> 00:23:38,416
<i>I know you have questions.</i>

395
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:41,419
<i>I have all the answers
you could ever want.</i>

396
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:43,421
I'm Reynard.

397
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:45,956
<i>Your place is with me.</i>

398
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:54,765
Who the fuck is Reynard,
and why is he in my head?

399
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:01,138
There's nothing we can do.

400
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,973
It's up to him.

401
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:04,875
- Jesus, he's stubborn.
- What is happening?

402
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:06,544
What is happening?
Will you get him out of my head?

403
00:24:06,546 --> 00:24:08,446
- Make it stop.
- What now?

404
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,514
- This is so much worse
than you think.

405
00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:12,483
- Is that senator Gaines?
- Probably.

406
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:14,151
I mean, why not?

407
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:16,754
- Can you do something
to ward his mind from the voice?

408
00:24:16,756 --> 00:24:18,889
- What voice?
- Reynard's.

409
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:20,925
- He's after his son.
- Where?

410
00:24:20,927 --> 00:24:24,195
- Outside the wards, I guess.

411
00:24:24,197 --> 00:24:27,164
- Okay, whatever
you're thinking, don't.

412
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,966
- I'm not the one
you should worry about.

413
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:53,190
- You are out of your element,
child of earth.

414
00:24:56,929 --> 00:24:59,163
Well done.

415
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:00,931
Well done.

416
00:25:04,537 --> 00:25:08,005
- Yes.

417
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:12,977
I'd give you an update,
but I hate seeing boys cry.

418
00:25:12,979 --> 00:25:15,546
- He won't be able
to get in here,

419
00:25:15,548 --> 00:25:19,650
not after the security protocols
we put in place after the beast.

420
00:25:19,652 --> 00:25:22,219
As long as they hold,
we're safe.

421
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:24,955
- You're probably right.
- I hope you're right,

422
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:27,224
but we are talking about
a not-so-benevolent god...

423
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:30,828
- Mm.
- After his only child.

424
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:34,265
- Listen, I'm sorry for getting
so hysterical back there.

425
00:25:34,267 --> 00:25:36,066
I'm having a lot
of trouble with this.

426
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:37,568
- It's okay.

427
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:39,003
- How did you get
his voice to stop?

428
00:25:39,005 --> 00:25:41,138
What the hell
is this thing on my neck?

429
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,173
- It's a patch.
- It blocks psychic interference.

430
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:45,175
It works, trust me.

431
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:48,579
- I have to be honest.
- I hope I'm in a mental ward.

432
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:53,017
- Majesty, you must
return to Whitespire.

433
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:55,219
- Are you insane?
- He will not wait.

434
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:58,022
- Who?
- The ambassador to the fairies.

435
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:06,664
- I'm afraid this has to end!

436
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:09,600
Don't prolong it.

437
00:26:09,602 --> 00:26:11,235
Monarch to monarch,

438
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:14,338
when I kill you,
I'll be merciful.

439
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,240
- That's kind of you.

440
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,957
Oh, shit.

441
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:35,159
- The wellspring.
- Shit.

442
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:42,032
- Praise ember's strength
and umber's wisdom.

443
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:43,968
Bring unto me
the lifeblood knowledge

444
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,704
of all...

445
00:26:54,614 --> 00:26:56,046
- all right, come on.

446
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:09,293
- Blackout.
- The wards are down.

447
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:12,396
Everyone get to the lab.
Now!

448
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:18,669
- Let's go.
- Run!

449
00:27:18,671 --> 00:27:20,337
What's happening?

450
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,684
- Move, people! Quickly!
- Inside! Let's go!

451
00:27:33,686 --> 00:27:35,319
Come on, this ain't a pop quiz.
Let's go.

452
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:37,688
You don't wanna be out there.
Let's go, come on.

453
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,356
How long can the emergency
generator in here

454
00:27:39,358 --> 00:27:41,191
- keep the lab warded?
- Hopefully long enough

455
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:42,993
until we think of something.

456
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,381
- Of course those I represent
would always consider

457
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:06,450
with the utmost respect

458
00:28:06,452 --> 00:28:10,354
any royal request, your majesty.

459
00:28:10,356 --> 00:28:12,790
- When can we meet
face-to-face?

460
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:16,060
- When you conclude
the bargain with me.

461
00:28:16,062 --> 00:28:17,327
- No.

462
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:20,297
I wanna know
who I'm sealing the deal with.

463
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:22,399
- Not possible, majesty.

464
00:28:22,401 --> 00:28:27,137
The ways of the fairies are...
Well, how should I put it...

465
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:30,040
As implacable
as they are ancient.

466
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:33,477
In any case, I would imagine
time is of the essence, no?

467
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:36,213
- The fairies can bring back
the wellspring?

468
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:37,414
- They can.

469
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:39,316
- And in return?

470
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:41,485
- A royal child of Whitespire.

471
00:28:41,487 --> 00:28:45,189
- The fairies want a baby?

472
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:47,291
They aren't gonna eat it,
are they?

473
00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:49,293
- It'll be raised as a fairy.

474
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:52,062
It'll know great knowledge,
and even greater power.

475
00:28:52,064 --> 00:28:56,834
- Well...
- I'm not loving this,

476
00:28:56,836 --> 00:29:00,070
- but I could get knocked up...
- no.

477
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:03,440
The child that grows in the womb
of the high king's wife.

478
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:05,442
- Are you fucking kidding me?

479
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:12,116
- Highness?
- A word?

480
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:17,154
You've offended the ambassador.

481
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:19,356
- He will no longer
bargain with you.

482
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:22,159
- What?
- Because you question him,

483
00:29:22,161 --> 00:29:24,795
he will only honor
the present deal

484
00:29:24,797 --> 00:29:29,333
without further amendment,
or there will be no deal at all.

485
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:38,842
- I do not have powers.
- That is impossible.

486
00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:41,311
- It's impossible you don't.

487
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:43,881
- Look at your career.
- Hey, I work hard.

488
00:29:43,883 --> 00:29:46,350
- Have you ever failed
at anything ever?

489
00:29:46,352 --> 00:29:49,219
Just be honest.

490
00:29:49,221 --> 00:29:51,255
I've had losses.

491
00:29:51,257 --> 00:29:53,223
- My parents...
- yeah, died,

492
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:56,360
and left you, what, $20 million?

493
00:29:56,362 --> 00:29:58,362
- So what are you
saying exactly?

494
00:29:58,364 --> 00:30:00,564
Are you saying I used
some kind of magic spell

495
00:30:00,566 --> 00:30:02,533
- to kill my parents for money?
- No. No.

496
00:30:02,535 --> 00:30:07,404
Look, what you have,
it is bigger than...

497
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:09,506
Than... than what
any magician can do.

498
00:30:09,508 --> 00:30:11,341
You know, you used your powers

499
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:14,478
even without knowing it
to create you.

500
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,316
And the world was made to
worship and follow you anywhere.

501
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:22,352
- So if my birth father's a god
and I'm a demigod,

502
00:30:22,354 --> 00:30:24,254
why the hell did it take me
a year to pass

503
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:28,292
the most boring farm bill
in the history of the senate?

504
00:30:28,294 --> 00:30:30,861
- But it got passed, right?

505
00:30:30,863 --> 00:30:33,263
Come on, has any bill
you ever sponsored failed?

506
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:36,400
- Come on.
- Has it?

507
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,271
- Holy shit.

508
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,228
- Hi.

509
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:08,298
- You can't
stay up there forever.

510
00:31:11,003 --> 00:31:14,371
- Fen, Eliot's going to lose,

511
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:16,306
if he hasn't already.

512
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:19,309
Without magic,
he's basically unarmed.

513
00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:21,245
And the wellspring's gone black.

514
00:31:21,247 --> 00:31:23,614
- You have to do something.

515
00:31:23,616 --> 00:31:25,949
- I think I can,

516
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:30,454
but I need you to promise me
that if magic is returned,

517
00:31:30,456 --> 00:31:33,323
Eliot lives
and there's no war...

518
00:31:33,325 --> 00:31:36,260
That you will do
exactly what I tell you.

519
00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:38,428
- Of course.
- Whatever it is.

520
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,998
- Yes. Please.
- Don't let him die.

521
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:50,374
- You are most skillful.

522
00:31:50,376 --> 00:31:54,278
- I'm a manipulative cunt.

523
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:58,415
Fix the wellspring,<i> now.</i>

524
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:17,434
No rush.

525
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,369
I'll win eventually.

526
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:21,939
I wish your magic
hadn't gone out.

527
00:32:21,941 --> 00:32:24,308
I like my fights fair.

528
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,543
- You do realize if this
is a legit magic blackout,

529
00:32:26,545 --> 00:32:29,246
it fucks both Fillory
and Loria, right?

530
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:31,581
- My people are
so used to scarcity,

531
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:33,650
I don't even think
it'll register.

532
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:37,020
Sometimes, I think they like
being dissatisfied.

533
00:32:37,022 --> 00:32:39,556
Preach.

534
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:42,359
If you do kill me,
I guess you'll spare me decades

535
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:46,596
of trying to fix a kingdom
hell-bent on staying broken,

536
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:50,033
doomed to sexual frustration.

537
00:32:50,035 --> 00:32:52,636
- But you have a wife.
- Exactly.

538
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:54,538
Oh, and I'm going
to be a father,

539
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,274
if that changes your mind about
the whole killing me thing.

540
00:32:57,276 --> 00:33:01,445
- Wish I had a choice,
but one of us has to die,

541
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:04,281
and I'm not the one up a tree.

542
00:33:04,283 --> 00:33:06,416
- Worth a shot.

543
00:33:06,418 --> 00:33:09,486
- At least you don't have
to worry about getting old.

544
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:11,455
- Excuse me.

545
00:33:11,457 --> 00:33:15,692
I would age like a fine wine.

546
00:33:15,694 --> 00:33:20,030
And you are a total DILF.

547
00:33:20,032 --> 00:33:21,765
- Should I be offended?

548
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:25,702
- Let's just say
it's too bad I have a wife.

549
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:29,506
- I get it.
- My love for my late wife

550
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:32,142
kept me from selecting
a husband too.

551
00:33:32,144 --> 00:33:35,445
- Um, wait.

552
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:36,713
What?

553
00:33:36,715 --> 00:33:40,450
- It is a shame
I have to kill you.

554
00:33:40,452 --> 00:33:43,720
I actually find you
very attractive.

555
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:46,056
- God damn it.

556
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:48,058
God damn it!

557
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:52,462
- Where's Quentin?
- What?

558
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:55,365
Shit.
Julia's not here either.

559
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:56,733
- What?

560
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:03,774
- I don't understand.
- You have a new weapon

561
00:34:03,776 --> 00:34:06,410
- to kill Reynard?
- No, you do.

562
00:34:06,412 --> 00:34:09,379
I do what?

563
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:13,083
- You have a nuclear bomb
inside of you.

564
00:34:13,085 --> 00:34:14,818
- Wait, Alice?
- I talked to her.

565
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,420
She's a killing machine
right now.

566
00:34:16,422 --> 00:34:18,388
Tell her you wanna make a deal.

567
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:21,458
She kills Reynard, she's free.

568
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,693
- No.

569
00:34:25,431 --> 00:34:28,398
- Do it, or we all die
right here, right now, q.

570
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:38,175
- It's not like you
to hide behind wards, Julia.

571
00:34:38,177 --> 00:34:41,311
- Come face me.
- Face him first.

572
00:34:41,313 --> 00:34:45,182
Mmm.

573
00:34:45,184 --> 00:34:48,752
Even with that...
Thing inside of him,

574
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:52,122
he's nowhere near
as interesting as you.

575
00:34:54,226 --> 00:34:56,226
But I'll make due.

576
00:34:56,228 --> 00:34:58,161
- Let me out, I'll kill him.
- No.

577
00:34:59,865 --> 00:35:04,134
Julia.

578
00:35:04,136 --> 00:35:05,268
- Get back inside the ward!
- Come on!

579
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,870
- Come on!
- Let me out!

580
00:35:08,841 --> 00:35:10,273
- Picked up this little trick

581
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,342
your six-fingered friend
pulled on me.

582
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:17,714
- You waited too long.
- You know what's funny, Julia?

583
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:20,717
You work so hard
to hide from me magically,

584
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:24,421
yet you get caught
by a simple security camera

585
00:35:24,423 --> 00:35:27,224
kidnapping a senator.

586
00:35:27,226 --> 00:35:29,192
It's all over the news.

587
00:35:29,194 --> 00:35:32,295
It's grainy, but I'd
recognize you anywhere.

588
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,764
So nice to meet
more of your friends.

589
00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:37,434
I think this is gonna be
a lot of fun.

590
00:35:37,436 --> 00:35:39,169
- We have to stop him.

591
00:35:46,211 --> 00:35:48,378
- My son.

592
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:51,481
- Whatever you are,

593
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:54,784
if I am what you say,

594
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:56,386
don't hurt these people.

595
00:35:56,388 --> 00:35:59,856
- Hurt them?
- No. Never.

596
00:35:59,858 --> 00:36:03,760
I froze them so they wouldn't
hurt themselves...

597
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:06,196
Or you.

598
00:36:06,198 --> 00:36:09,366
Come.
Come closer.

599
00:36:16,909 --> 00:36:18,308
- Damn it!

600
00:36:40,499 --> 00:36:43,567
- Praise ember's strength
and umber's wisdom.

601
00:36:50,943 --> 00:36:52,943
So...

602
00:36:52,945 --> 00:36:55,879
Magic's back.

603
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:23,974
Shit.

604
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,278
What the fuck?

605
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,647
- It's called the clean room.

606
00:37:30,649 --> 00:37:32,916
No magic.

607
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:34,818
- Did you put
a sleeping spell on me?

608
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:38,321
Open this door!

609
00:37:38,323 --> 00:37:43,026
- I've been trying
to understand you.

610
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:45,562
At least that's what I thought.
What I've really been doing

611
00:37:45,564 --> 00:37:47,964
is trying to make
excuses for you.

612
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:50,634
But I can't anymore,

613
00:37:50,636 --> 00:37:54,271
not after what you did
to Quentin today.

614
00:37:54,273 --> 00:37:55,572
- But he's fine, right?

615
00:37:55,574 --> 00:37:58,975
- That's just luck,
and you know it.

616
00:37:58,977 --> 00:38:02,345
You fed him to Reynard.

617
00:38:02,347 --> 00:38:05,982
- He knew how to survive.
- Yeah, by doing what you want.

618
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:09,619
That's all you see anymore,
is what you want.

619
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:13,556
You don't feel anymore, Julia,

620
00:38:13,558 --> 00:38:16,660
not the way a human does.

621
00:38:16,662 --> 00:38:20,530
It's not your fault.

622
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:24,067
I hope we can figure
something out,

623
00:38:24,069 --> 00:38:26,870
but until then,

624
00:38:26,872 --> 00:38:28,338
this is it for you.

625
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,307
- Kady...

626
00:38:31,575 --> 00:38:34,611
- Citizens,
your warrior king returns.

627
00:38:34,613 --> 00:38:38,315
- Praise ember!
- You scared me, you dick.

628
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:41,985
- Good to see you too, Bambi.

629
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:45,021
- Eliot, are... are you okay?
- Are you hurt?

630
00:38:45,023 --> 00:38:48,525
- All in one piece, thanks
to that sword spell of yours.

631
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:53,096
- I'm just glad you're safe.
- We both are.

632
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:56,466
I can't believe
you actually won.

633
00:38:56,468 --> 00:38:58,535
- Uh, is it really
that shocking?

634
00:38:58,537 --> 00:39:01,037
- Having seen how you fight
without magic, yes.

635
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:02,539
- Hold up.

636
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:04,941
What's king daddy fuckface
doing here?

637
00:39:04,943 --> 00:39:08,511
- Ah, king Idri
is our honored guest.

638
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:11,548
- What happened to the whole
"one must die" deal?

639
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,916
- We're kings.

640
00:39:12,918 --> 00:39:14,384
What's the point
of having great power

641
00:39:14,386 --> 00:39:16,386
if not to right wrongs?

642
00:39:16,388 --> 00:39:18,922
We...

643
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:21,958
Made an agreement.

644
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,728
- We're getting married.
- Wait, what?

645
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:27,430
- Uh, hello?

646
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:30,600
Pregnant wifey?
Your dick no work-y?

647
00:39:30,602 --> 00:39:33,503
- Before I flay whoever
neglected to inform me sooner,

648
00:39:33,505 --> 00:39:38,041
apparently all monarchs
on this glorious, magical planet

649
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:39,542
are entitled to one of each.

650
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:41,778
A wife, and a husband.

651
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,446
- So what?

652
00:39:43,448 --> 00:39:45,081
You're all just gonna
shack up together?

653
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:48,418
- We're all just one big royal
polyamorous family.

654
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,053
Isn't it great?
No one has to die.

655
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:52,088
Everyone gets what they want.

656
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:55,024
- El, can we take a second?

657
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:00,697
What?
So you fucked his son.

658
00:40:00,699 --> 00:40:02,532
It doesn't have to be weird.

659
00:40:02,534 --> 00:40:05,068
- You sure this is a good idea?

660
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,603
I mean, you're really
doubling up

661
00:40:06,605 --> 00:40:09,072
on Fillorian marriage contracts.

662
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:12,409
- Sometimes, you have
to sacrifice for diplomacy.

663
00:40:12,411 --> 00:40:14,577
And just wait until
we're husband and husband,

664
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:18,748
and what some would call
pillow talk, we call...

665
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,683
- Espionage?

666
00:40:20,685 --> 00:40:23,052
- Diplomatic leverage.

667
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:24,788
- Your highness!

668
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:27,457
Thank ember
for your safe return.

669
00:40:27,459 --> 00:40:30,827
More good news, the wellspring
is finally replenishing itself.

670
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:33,696
- Ah, good old tick.

671
00:40:33,698 --> 00:40:36,766
Well, everything's
coming up Eliot.

672
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:40,637
Congrats, future hubby.
Your half is now shit-free.

673
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:43,206
- I'm sorry, his what?

674
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:46,743
- That was the deal.
- Marriage, peace,

675
00:40:46,745 --> 00:40:50,146
and a 50/50 wellspring split.

676
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:52,615
- So how'd we finally fix
the wellspring?

677
00:40:58,023 --> 00:40:59,722
- Well...

678
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:18,875
- I am so sorry.

679
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,916
I just can't do this anymore.

680
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:45,835
Alice...

681
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:49,539
I hope you meant it.

682
00:41:49,541 --> 00:41:52,542
I hope you just go and do...

683
00:41:52,544 --> 00:41:55,712
Beautiful magic.

684
00:41:55,714 --> 00:41:56,746
Alice...

685
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:04,621
Quentin says go free.
