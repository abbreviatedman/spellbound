1
00:00:00,968 --> 00:00:02,732
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:04,203
Fuck!

3
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:05,304
I'm so sorry.

4
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:07,263
It's Reynard. He's back.

5
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:08,570
Wait, I am pregnant.

6
00:00:09,243 --> 00:00:11,508
I wasn't the only one
he raped that night,

7
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:13,740
but I was the only
one who got pregnant.

8
00:00:14,348 --> 00:00:16,715
<i>This is exorcism.
You understand?</i>

9
00:00:16,783 --> 00:00:18,012
Did it work? Is it gone?

10
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:22,320
In the center of your being,
there's a tiny beating heart.

11
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:24,017
It's called a Shade.

12
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:25,650
It's what makes you feel

13
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:27,558
the pain will burn
you till there's nothing.

14
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:29,728
There was a complication.

15
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:31,594
Her Shade, it's gone.

16
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,032
I feel light.

17
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,592
Like a million-pound
weight's off my chest.

18
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:37,433
Say we get the perfect spell.

19
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:39,632
Think about the energy
it'd take to work it.

20
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,800
Dana's baby. His son.

21
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,673
You know, there is a
ton of lore on demigods.

22
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:45,212
They're powerful
in their own right.

23
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:46,577
We need to find him.

24
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:47,740
As for Loria...

25
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:50,247
Some 8,000 troops are
headed to the border.

26
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:51,477
So we're totally outnumbered.

27
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,749
And, of course, our
preparation is affected

28
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,915
by the continued
unsteadiness of the Wellspring.

29
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,670
Looks like... ELIOT:
A major drought's hit.

30
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:03,757
You can't even get out of
this shoddy little Magician.

31
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,095
Free yourself. Then find me.

32
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,840
- Alice, we can talk about this...
- Just shut up! Shut up!

33
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,109
This is your body trying
to hold a Niffin inside it.

34
00:01:11,605 --> 00:01:12,698
You can't.

35
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:14,435
Not for much longer,

36
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:15,999
or it's gonna kill us both.

37
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:25,785
Seriously, guys, I'm in a cage.

38
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:29,186
Don't you think this
is a tad redundant?

39
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:31,752
Protocol. For werewolves.

40
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:34,886
Okay, technically, I have
sexually transmitted lycanthropy.

41
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:36,157
A very mild case.

42
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:39,631
Would've been cool to
actually fully wolf out, you know?

43
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:41,198
Either way, it's
totally curable.

44
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:44,568
Treatable. There
is no actual cure.

45
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,406
Well, silver bullet.

46
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:49,775
Hey, don't go through my bag.

47
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:52,244
Quentin, you're dying.

48
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:54,572
Yeah, well, aren't we all?

49
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:56,076
You are dying quickly.

50
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,744
You cannot keep this thing
inside you much longer.

51
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:00,715
Well, I can't let her go.

52
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,813
Which is why you must box her.

53
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:04,380
I'm not doing that to Alice.

54
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,256
Quentin, there is no more Alice.

55
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:09,296
This is uncharted
territory. Nobody knows...

56
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,940
Well, I know that you
will be dead in days

57
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,398
if you don't rid
yourself of her.

58
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,767
May I help you steal from me?

59
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:17,197
Nope. I got it.

60
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:20,432
Good luck with all your shit.

61
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,075
Damn brownouts.

62
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:34,753
We may be the least
trusted monarchs

63
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:37,450
in the history of Fillory.

64
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,151
Thank God they
don't have polls here.

65
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,133
That's the third
brownout this week.

66
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:51,442
If we don't fix the Wellspring
soon, Your Majesty...

67
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,770
One problem at a time, okay?

68
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,469
Our soldiers are
deserting us in protest,

69
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:59,069
thanks to Julia
committing tree genocide.

70
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:00,307
Pardon me, Your Majesty.

71
00:03:00,781 --> 00:03:05,048
For the official records, may I
suggest a slightly less incendiary term.

72
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:06,848
Perhaps "arbicide"?

73
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,684
Sure, if you can also recommend

74
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,724
how we fight a war
without an army.

75
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:20,433
Your Majesty, there is one
option, a rather obscure law based...

76
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,798
Less words.

77
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:25,571
One-on-one combat
between monarchs.

78
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,674
A duel? El...

79
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,382
With Ess' dad? He's
got to be at least 50.

80
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:32,843
And I'm pretty buff
from all the living

81
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:35,109
without technology
or decent wine.

82
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:36,206
Slow down.

83
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:38,218
Is there any rule
about not using magic?

84
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:40,049
No, Your Majesty.

85
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,315
Highness, if I may,

86
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:45,352
there is a reason we haven't
brought up this option before,

87
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:48,589
especially since magic is
not completely dependable.

88
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:53,032
Simply put, you're
likely to, well, die.

89
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:54,467
Mmm-hmm.

90
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:58,402
Tick, if I did this, how
popular would I be?

91
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,905
No king has ever volunteered
for one-on-one combat.

92
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:05,702
If you were to prevail,

93
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:09,546
you would easily be the
greatest leader in Fillorian history.

94
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,483
The greatest. The greatest.

95
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:14,783
God. He's already
seeing the statues.

96
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,251
I hereby decree,

97
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:20,351
rulers done gonna rumble!

98
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:35,442
Eliot's the king of all this?

99
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:38,445
Yeah, looking for rock solid
proof there's no justice? That.

100
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,639
Even this dungeon's nicer
than any place I lived as a kid.

101
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:43,911
Well, except for my uncle's BMW.

102
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:46,283
Would've been even nicer if
he'd actually been my uncle.

103
00:04:48,588 --> 00:04:51,422
Don't be fooled by the
high gloss. This place sucks.

104
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,228
Hey.

105
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:57,329
What's up?

106
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:59,055
We found Reynard's son.

107
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,432
So this is a break out.

108
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,595
Why are you in here
anyway? I killed trees.

109
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,197
Seriously? That could talk.

110
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,105
They have talking trees here?

111
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:10,600
Not anymore.

112
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:15,143
So what's Reynard's son like?

113
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:17,514
I guarantee you won't
believe it. Let's go.

114
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:28,151
The fuck...

115
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:30,953
He's marking his territory.

116
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:34,026
Hey. I refuse to be shamed.

117
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:37,831
Didn't you hear what Friar Joseph
said? Not all Niffins are the same.

118
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:41,100
I'm not gonna go on some killing
spree any more than he would.

119
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:46,113
Q? Don't you believe me?

120
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:48,639
I believe you believe you.

121
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:50,106
Sorry?

122
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:53,317
I'm not talking to you.

123
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:59,356
I just wanna do
what Joseph does.

124
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:02,123
Please. Beautiful,
high-level magic.

125
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,996
I am not letting you
loose. It's bad for the world.

126
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:13,600
And I'm not boxing you 'cause
I don't wanna know a world

127
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:16,332
without Alice.

128
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,544
Keep this up, and
you won't have to.

129
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:23,883
We'll both be dead. Good plan.

130
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:33,459
Eliot...

131
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,958
the intel I'm
getting on King Idri

132
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:38,760
and the protocols
of dueling, not good.

133
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,465
I mean, you ever even
touched a sword before today?

134
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:44,333
No, but Magician.

135
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,229
Well, sword-fighting spells,

136
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:51,108
of which there are only two anyone
knows of, take months to master.

137
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:53,208
Why? It's a giant butter knife.

138
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:01,817
It's all the variables in any
given match. It's almost infinite.

139
00:07:02,322 --> 00:07:05,554
I mean, sure, you
could slap together

140
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:09,255
a spell, maybe get
four, five good moves,

141
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:11,627
which brings us to thing two.

142
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:13,530
How many things are there?

143
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:18,338
Look, King Idri
has fought 14 duels,

144
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:19,998
all opponents dead.

145
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:29,548
<i>Senator Gaines' rise has been
described as nothing less than meteoric.</i>

146
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,517
Reynard's son is John Gaines?

147
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,446
You know him?

148
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,783
I mean, I know who he is.

149
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:36,668
He's on rails to
the White House.

150
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:39,519
I hit one of his rallies,
did a psychic scan.

151
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,493
Dude believes
every word he says.

152
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,702
<i>I believe that everyone is
born with a flame of goodness.</i>

153
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:57,508
<i>And if my light or
yours go out, remember,</i>

154
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:00,045
<i>we're not alone in this world.</i>

155
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:05,642
See? Wow.

156
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:09,286
He's the perfect demigod
spokesmodel of absolute evil.

157
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:11,456
Who's kind of hot as shit.

158
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,319
What? Sorry.

159
00:08:14,627 --> 00:08:16,755
Look, he's not even my
type, obviously. It's weird.

160
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:18,731
Dude has more
magic coming off him

161
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:20,926
than every Magician
on Earth combined

162
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:23,796
and knows not one
thing about magic.

163
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:27,573
Well, he's sure gonna.

164
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,279
How's the battle prep?

165
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:45,948
If someone had told me a year
ago that I'd be venting to my wife

166
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:49,590
while preparing to do battle on
behalf of my mythical kingdom,

167
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,133
I'd have done a lot more drugs.

168
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,133
I have something
that might help.

169
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:58,995
Great, depending on what
your definition of "help" is.

170
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,135
I know I haven't always
given you reason to trust me.

171
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:07,337
My grandpa forged this
sword for a High King

172
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:09,144
who vanished
without ever claiming it.

173
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,878
Since then, my
family's been saving it

174
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,510
for someone truly worthy.

175
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:17,719
It's beautiful, but I'm
not sure it actually helps.

176
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,071
I'll never learn
a spell in time.

177
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:22,826
It was made for a king, as
was the accompanying spell.

178
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,358
Some sword spells
take weeks to master.

179
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:30,734
Not when it's
written for a king.

180
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:34,070
My grandpa was the royal
family's favorite swordsmith

181
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,632
because he knew
they were, uh, too...

182
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:37,836
Too lazy to learn?

183
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:42,007
Too pre-occupied with
matters of state for busywork.

184
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:46,180
With this spell and this blade,

185
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,221
you will be a master swordsman.

186
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:52,956
Insert weak double
entendre I'd have to explain.

187
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:54,317
Sorry?

188
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:58,956
"Praise Ember's strength
and Umber's wisdom.

189
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:03,066
"Bring unto me the lifeblood
knowledge of all masters of the blade

190
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:04,263
"who have come before."

191
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:09,508
Fen...

192
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:15,209
Fen, I actually feel
marginally less fucked now.

193
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,386
All my life, I've
put my family first.

194
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,613
Now that's you and our baby.

195
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:29,318
I'll really try
not to die again.

196
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,356
I'd really appreciate that.

197
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,542
No, no, no. Stop.
Hold on. Hey, Becky?

198
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:48,880
Security? Security?

199
00:10:48,948 --> 00:10:49,948
It's not working.

200
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,543
All right.

201
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,219
Whatever this is, stop.
Tell me what you want.

202
00:10:57,924 --> 00:11:00,223
Man, you're good. Mmm-hmm.

203
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:02,194
Let's get to it.

204
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:07,992
Magic is real.

205
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:12,096
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

206
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:23,749
Okay.

207
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:27,281
Okay, is this some
kind of a gag?

208
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,913
Is this a publicity
stunt for a TV show?

209
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:33,249
We're Magicians being hunted
by an evil god, and so are you.

210
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,221
Listen, obviously, you guys
believe this, and I respect that.

211
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:40,961
Bullshit. No, it is not
bullshit. It is... Okay.

212
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,711
This'll take forever. It's
not like we need him alive.

213
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:43,930
Jesus! What the fuck, Julia?

214
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:48,066
We don't need him.
We need his energy. No.

215
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,838
You're born, huge energy.
You die, bigger energy.

216
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:52,503
Especially a demigod.

217
00:11:52,579 --> 00:11:54,946
That is what we are after
here, people, the energy.

218
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,108
Right now, he's just a
skin sack hiding it from us.

219
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,550
Okay, you'd need
something to hold that energy.

220
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,890
Like this? Jesus.

221
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:05,755
Oh, my God. You
planned this all along.

222
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:09,023
All right, all of you, get the
fuck out of my office now.

223
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:10,893
I won't die here tonight.

224
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:12,865
I will not die here!

225
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,603
Oh, shit.

226
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:24,604
He's okay. He just fainted.

227
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:26,402
Hey! Whoa.

228
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:30,780
No. We are not... Not
killing a US Senator.

229
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,483
But we will commit a
felony almost as stupid.

230
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:39,886
Okay, sloth,

231
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,019
you're the most honest
one on the damn council,

232
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:45,088
so I'm counting on you to
not kiss my ass or cover yours.

233
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:48,399
We've got a sword
spell, so yay us,

234
00:12:48,468 --> 00:12:50,437
but we need the
Wellspring to work.

235
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,731
There can't be one brownout
or blip during the duel.

236
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,709
So straight up, how
do we guarantee that?

237
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,278
It's too... What?

238
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,742
Um...

239
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:10,383
There is something, but
we urge you not to do it.

240
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,493
Tell me. Petition the Fairies.

241
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:15,427
Fairies?

242
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,259
Do I know about the Fairies?

243
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,002
They exist outside our realm.

244
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:28,102
They can be contacted,
and they have great powers.

245
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:30,306
Well, can they
fix the Wellspring?

246
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:32,744
Almost certainly.

247
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,576
Guys, the fuck?

248
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:37,808
Uh, fairies are notoriously

249
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,543
mercurial?

250
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,986
Have you met your King?

251
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:46,083
They make complex deals
with steep prices and...

252
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:48,060
Yeah, get me a meeting.

253
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:51,563
One has to contact their
ambassador, a human,

254
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:55,030
which can sometimes
take days, even weeks.

255
00:13:55,101 --> 00:13:56,262
Then chop, chop.

256
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:00,034
And never keep information
from me again, okay?

257
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,472
Yes, Your Highness.

258
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:04,477
You, sloth, you read me?

259
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,581
What? Nothing.

260
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:19,150
Is that that senator dude?

261
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:22,389
You think we kidnapped a US
senator and stuffed him in a closet?

262
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:25,732
No, Jesus, of course not. Okay.

263
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,279
How'd you get
him past the wards?

264
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:31,234
Hey, does one of you
have an alumni key?

265
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:35,308
So cool. Um, can I
borrow it sometime?

266
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,674
There's this really hot...

267
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:39,838
Vodka Gibson, four onions.

268
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:40,912
Yeah, right away.

269
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,828
So what do we do when he wakes
up and starts kicking the door?

270
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:47,514
Whatever it is has
nothing to do with you.

271
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,286
Stay away from him. Or?

272
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:53,824
No, you don't wanna go there.

273
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:58,309
Pretty sure we're already there.

274
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:00,132
Enough.

275
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,864
I'll keep an eye on the Senator.

276
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:06,098
She's psychotic.

277
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:10,170
Look, she's being a
little extreme, yeah,

278
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:13,408
but she's got her reasons,
okay? Just trust me.

279
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,479
I know Julia.

280
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,812
That's not Julia.
Even she knows that.

281
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,131
The only person who doesn't
seem to know that is you!

282
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:33,462
Looks good.

283
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,126
What's wrong? Wrong?

284
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:38,861
Your face. I'm an
obsessive fan, so tell.

285
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:41,573
Thank you, Soren.

286
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:48,942
The sword's good. The spell
makes me great. But great enough?

287
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:52,485
If I lose, forget me, all of
you are dead or imprisoned.

288
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:59,556
Why didn't I see
how huge this is?

289
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:01,993
I'm...

290
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,866
I'm scared, for all of us.

291
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:09,700
You know what
I'm thinking about?

292
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:15,005
That video you showed me of your
high school production of <i>Les Mis.</i>

293
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,141
You were such a great Valjean.

294
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:20,378
Ugh.

295
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,882
I was all right at the matinees.

296
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:28,019
Evenings, I'd agree, I
scaled the heights. Mmm.

297
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:29,087
But

298
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:31,623
what's your point?

299
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:35,625
Well, all this reading
we've been doing on war,

300
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:39,962
I keep coming across soldiers
who'd sing before going into battle.

301
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:41,832
To avoid throwing up with fear?

302
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:44,763
It built confidence, yes.

303
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:48,868
Projected power, destabilized
the enemy. So give me.

304
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:52,739
What? The big number.

305
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:56,348
I can't.

306
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,816
I'll never remember
all the lyrics.

307
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,780
It's practically
the entire cast.

308
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,155
Which is why...

309
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:08,827
Magic.

310
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:12,256
No, I should practice.

311
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:17,730
So move your ass and sing. Beyoncé
does, which is why she's a boss.

312
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:18,970
Mmm-mmm.

313
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:20,162
Don't make me sing.

314
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,104
<i>One day more</i>

315
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:26,570
<i>Another day, another destiny</i>

316
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:28,877
<i>This never-ending
road to Calvary</i>

317
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:32,743
<i>These men who
seem to know my crime</i>

318
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:34,150
<i>Will surely come a second time</i>

319
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,449
<i>One day more...</i>

320
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:38,753
<i>I did not live until today</i>

321
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:43,827
<i>How can I live
when we are parted?</i>

322
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:46,326
<i>One day more</i>

323
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:50,364
<i>Tomorrow you'll be worlds away</i>

324
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:56,706
<i>And yet with you,
my world has started</i>

325
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:01,345
<i>One more day all on my own</i>

326
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:04,578
<i>Will we ever meet again?</i>

327
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,984
<i>One more day with him not caring</i>

328
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:10,614
<i>I was born to be with you</i>

329
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:13,717
<i>What a life I might have known</i>

330
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:16,661
<i>And I swear I will be true</i>

331
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:18,925
<i>But he never saw me there</i>

332
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:28,269
<i>One more day before the storm</i>

333
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:31,175
<i>Do I follow where she goes?</i>

334
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:33,974
<i>At the barricades of freedom</i>

335
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:36,743
<i>Shall I join my brothers there?</i>

336
00:18:36,816 --> 00:18:39,615
<i>When our ranks begin to form</i>

337
00:18:39,685 --> 00:18:42,587
<i>Do I stay and do I dare?</i>

338
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:46,023
<i>Will you take your
place with me?</i>

339
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:52,362
<i>The time is now, the day is here</i>

340
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:55,367
<i>One day more</i>

341
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,596
Sorry, I had to
skip some verses.

342
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,697
They're great, but they don't
really apply to our situation.

343
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,964
Oh.

344
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,907
Okay. Got you.

345
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:07,143
<i>One day to a new beginning</i>

346
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:10,206
<i>Raise the flag of freedom high</i>

347
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:13,218
<i>Every man will be a king</i>

348
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:15,186
<i>Every man will be a king</i>

349
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:18,588
<i>There's a new
world for the winning</i>

350
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:21,025
<i>There's a new world to be won</i>

351
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:24,063
<i>Do you hear the people sing?</i>

352
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:27,123
<i>My place is here</i>

353
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:30,567
<i>I fight with you</i>

354
00:19:30,636 --> 00:19:32,298
<i>One day more</i>

355
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:35,808
<i>I did not live until today</i>

356
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:41,580
<i>How can I live
when we are parted?</i>

357
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:43,809
<i>One day more</i>

358
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:46,079
<i>Tomorrow you'll be worlds away</i>

359
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:52,088
<i>And yet with you
my world has started</i>

360
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:53,626
<i>Tomorrow we'll be far away</i>

361
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,025
<i>Tomorrow is the judgment day</i>

362
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:57,256
<i>Tomorrow we'll discover</i>

363
00:19:57,329 --> 00:20:00,629
<i>What our god in
heaven has in store</i>

364
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,295
<i>One more dawn</i>

365
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,634
<i>One more day</i>

366
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:08,607
<i>One day more</i>

367
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:24,723
I'm confused. Is
the duel not today?

368
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:26,284
It's a metaphor.

369
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:27,417
I love that show.

370
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:28,751
You know it?

371
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:31,388
Boarding school on
Earth. I played Javert.

372
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:32,931
Type-casting.

373
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:40,482
"Praise Ember's strength
and Umber's wisdom.

374
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:43,186
"Bring unto me the lifeblood
knowledge of all masters of the blade."

375
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:48,146
King Idri.

376
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,450
King Eliot.

377
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:56,315
I'm sorry I have to kill you.

378
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:57,388
I've died before.

379
00:20:58,057 --> 00:21:01,721
Doesn't seem to take
with me. Shall we?

380
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:17,808
Ah!

381
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:32,920
Okay, is he allowed to do that?

382
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:35,691
Kings do whatever.

383
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:37,962
Fine, he bitched out. It's over.

384
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,828
It's over when
one ruler is dead.

385
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:44,368
Another favorite show
of mine, <i>Into the Woods.</i>

386
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:01,251
I cannot believe how
fucking boring this is.

387
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:06,885
You know I can see magic?

388
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:13,123
Not the kind that you can do
with your hands, stone-age bullshit.

389
00:22:13,432 --> 00:22:19,338
I can see pure magic in
1,000 dimensions all at once.

390
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:22,271
You're not Quentin.

391
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,469
Get me out of here.

392
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:28,546
Alice. Quentin always
said you were smart.

393
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:31,040
He said the same about you.

394
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:33,176
Well, then, between
the two of us,

395
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:34,914
we should be able to
figure something out.

396
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:37,650
I'm not sure that's
what Q would want.

397
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:41,426
What do you want, Julia?
What are you thinking?

398
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,790
Oh, I can almost see it.

399
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:50,500
Just like I can see that
your Shade is gone,

400
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:57,707
which is how I know that your
thoughts are pure, unencumbered.

401
00:22:58,644 --> 00:22:59,737
I'm right, aren't I?

402
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:06,777
We both know life is not cloudy
with regret, need, sadness.

403
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:12,155
We both know life is
crystalline. Clear, cold, sharp.

404
00:23:13,025 --> 00:23:14,025
You...

405
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:16,451
He's bleeding.

406
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,498
God, he's so weak.

407
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,606
<i>John, I'm here.</i>

408
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:41,814
<i>I know you have questions. I have
all the answers you could ever want.</i>

409
00:23:43,489 --> 00:23:45,515
I'm Reynard. Help!

410
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,026
<i>Your place is with me.</i> Help!

411
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:55,730
Who the fuck is Reynard,
and why is he in my head?

412
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:04,341
- There's nothing we can do.
- It's up to him.

413
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,288
Jesus, he's stubborn. SENATOR
GAINES: What's happening?

414
00:24:06,312 --> 00:24:08,123
What is happening? Will
you get him out of my head?

415
00:24:08,147 --> 00:24:09,809
Make it stop! What now?

416
00:24:09,882 --> 00:24:11,407
It's so much worse
than you think.

417
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:13,247
Put him here. Is
that Senator Gaines?

418
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:15,154
Probably, I mean, why not?

419
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:18,121
Can you do something to
ward his mind from the voice?

420
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:21,183
What voice? Reynard's.
He's after his son.

421
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,691
Where? Outside
the wards, I guess.

422
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:28,365
Okay, whatever
you're thinking, don't.

423
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:30,554
I'm not the one you
should worry about.

424
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:55,026
You are out of your
element, Child of Earth.

425
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:01,763
Well done. Well done.

426
00:25:06,472 --> 00:25:07,472
Yes!

427
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:13,307
I'd give you an update,
but I hate seeing boys cry.

428
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,104
He won't be able to get in here.

429
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:18,642
Not after the security protocols

430
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:20,242
we put in place after The Beast.

431
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:23,346
As long as they
hold, we're safe.

432
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:24,922
You're probably right.

433
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:28,828
I hope you're right, but we are
talking about a not-so-benevolent god

434
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:30,726
after his only child.

435
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,892
Listen, I'm sorry for getting
so hysterical back there.

436
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:37,245
I'm having a lot
of trouble with this.

437
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,269
It's okay.

438
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:40,515
How did you get
his voice to stop?

439
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:42,419
What the hell is this
thing on my neck?

440
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,344
It's a patch. It blocks
psychic interference. It works.

441
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,813
Trust me. I have to be honest.

442
00:25:48,347 --> 00:25:49,815
I hope I'm in a mental ward.

443
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:54,411
Majesty, you must
return to Whitespire.

444
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:55,545
Are you insane?

445
00:25:55,621 --> 00:25:57,249
He will not wait. Who?

446
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:59,621
The Ambassador to the Fairies.

447
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:07,492
I'm afraid this has to end.

448
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,063
Don't prolong it.

449
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:15,506
Monarch to monarch,
when I kill you, I'll be merciful.

450
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,504
That's kind of you.

451
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:32,447
Oh, shit.

452
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,021
The Wellspring. Shit.

453
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,220
"Praise Ember's strength
and Umber's wisdom.

454
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:46,631
"Bring unto me the
lifeblood knowledge of all..."

455
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:57,172
All right, come on.

456
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:12,762
Blackout. The wards are down.
Everyone, get to the lab. Now!

457
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,438
Let's go. DEAN: Run!

458
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:34,547
- Move, people. Quickly!
- Inside! Let's go.

459
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,732
Come on. This ain't a pop quiz.
Let's go. You don't wanna be out there.

460
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:38,883
Let's go. Come on.

461
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,870
How long can the emergency
generator in here keep the lab warded?

462
00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:43,894
Hopefully, long enough
until we think of something.

463
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:05,950
Of course, those I represent
would always consider

464
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:10,183
with the utmost respect any
royal request, Your Majesty.

465
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:13,719
When can we meet face-to-face?

466
00:28:14,426 --> 00:28:16,861
When you conclude
the bargain, with me.

467
00:28:17,596 --> 00:28:18,596
No.

468
00:28:18,964 --> 00:28:21,331
I wanna know who I'm
sealing the deal with.

469
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,528
Not possible, Majesty.
The ways of the Fairies are...

470
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:27,799
Well, how should I put it?

471
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:30,298
As implacable as
they are ancient.

472
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:34,672
In any case, I would imagine
time is of the essence, no?

473
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,206
The Fairies can bring
back the Wellspring?

474
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:38,282
They can.

475
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:40,675
And in return?

476
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:42,550
A royal child of Whitespire.

477
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:44,417
The Fairies want a baby?

478
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:48,522
They aren't gonna
eat it, are they?

479
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:50,290
It'll be raised as a Fairy.

480
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:53,160
It will know great knowledge
and even greater power.

481
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:54,465
Well,

482
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:59,900
I'm not loving this, but I
could get knocked up...

483
00:28:59,972 --> 00:29:00,972
No.

484
00:29:01,607 --> 00:29:04,975
The child that grows in the
womb of the High King's wife.

485
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:06,978
Are you fucking kidding me?

486
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:13,242
Highness, a word?

487
00:29:15,654 --> 00:29:17,054
You've offended the Ambassador.

488
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:21,389
He will no longer
bargain with you. What?

489
00:29:22,361 --> 00:29:25,820
Because you questioned him,
he will only honor the present deal

490
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:29,768
without further amendment,
or there will be no deal at all.

491
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:39,672
I do not have powers.
That is impossible.

492
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,904
It's impossible you
don't. Look at your career.

493
00:29:43,982 --> 00:29:45,416
Hey. I work hard.

494
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:48,886
Have you ever failed at
anything, ever? Just be honest.

495
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:53,485
I've had losses. My parents...

496
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:57,461
Yeah, died and left
you, what, $20 million?

497
00:29:58,063 --> 00:30:00,032
So what are you saying exactly?

498
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:02,777
Are you saying I used some kind of
magic spell to kill my parents for money?

499
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:03,894
No, no.

500
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:08,065
Look, what you have is bigger

501
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:10,940
than what any Magician can do.

502
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:14,902
You used your powers, even
without knowing it, to create you.

503
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:20,209
And the world was made to
worship and follow you anywhere.

504
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:23,889
So if my birth father is a
god, and I'm a demigod,

505
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:25,423
why the hell did
it take me a year

506
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,255
to pass the most boring farm
bill in the history of the Senate?

507
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:30,987
But it got passed, right?

508
00:30:32,397 --> 00:30:34,662
Well, has any bill you
ever sponsored failed?

509
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,825
Come on. Has it?

510
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:41,963
Holy shit.

511
00:31:03,128 --> 00:31:04,152
Hi.

512
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:07,077
You can't stay up there forever.

513
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:17,208
Fen, Eliot's going to
lose, if he hasn't already.

514
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:20,779
Without magic he's
basically unarmed,

515
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:22,508
and the Wellspring's gone black.

516
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:24,072
You have to do something.

517
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,477
I think I can,

518
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:29,612
but I need you to promise me

519
00:31:29,688 --> 00:31:34,422
that if magic is returned,
Eliot lives, and there's no war,

520
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:37,562
that you will do
exactly what I tell you.

521
00:31:37,863 --> 00:31:39,627
Of course. Whatever it is.

522
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:42,330
Yes. Please. Don't let him die.

523
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:50,700
You are most skillful.

524
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,138
I'm a manipulative cunt.

525
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:59,011
Fix the Wellspring. Now.

526
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:17,935
No rush.

527
00:32:19,004 --> 00:32:20,004
I'll win eventually.

528
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:22,307
I wish your magic
hadn't gone out.

529
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:24,603
I like my fights fair.

530
00:32:25,844 --> 00:32:28,006
You do realize, if this
is a legit magic blackout,

531
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:30,310
it fucks both Fillory
and Loria, right?

532
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:33,045
My people are so
used to scarcity,

533
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:34,438
I don't even
think it'll register.

534
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:38,687
Sometimes, I think they
like being dissatisfied.

535
00:32:38,757 --> 00:32:40,726
Ugh. Preach.

536
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,219
If you do kill me, I
guess you'll spare me

537
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:47,960
decades of trying to fix a kingdom
hell-bent on staying broken,

538
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:50,502
doomed to sexual frustration...

539
00:32:51,603 --> 00:32:53,469
But you have a wife. Exactly.

540
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:56,073
Oh. And I'm going
to be a father,

541
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:58,461
if that changes your mind
about the whole killing-me thing.

542
00:32:58,777 --> 00:33:00,006
Wish I had a choice.

543
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:05,147
But one of us has to die,
and I'm not the one up a tree.

544
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,674
Worth a shot.

545
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,919
At least you don't have
to worry about getting old.

546
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:14,990
Excuse me. I would
age like a fine wine.

547
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,560
And you are a total DILF.

548
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:23,301
Should I be offended?

549
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:25,166
Let's just say it's
too bad I have a wife.

550
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:28,339
I get it.

551
00:33:28,807 --> 00:33:32,835
My love for my late wife kept
me from selecting a husband, too.

552
00:33:33,812 --> 00:33:34,905
Um...

553
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,313
Wait. What?

554
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,009
It is a shame I
have to kill you.

555
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:43,819
I actually find
you very attractive.

556
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:46,423
God damn it.

557
00:33:47,826 --> 00:33:49,506
God damn it!

558
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:52,423
Where's Quentin? What?

559
00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:54,932
Shit.

560
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:57,126
Julia's not here, either. What?

561
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:06,434
I don't understand. You have
a new weapon to kill Reynard?

562
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:09,777
No, you do. I do, what?

563
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:13,545
You have a nuclear
bomb inside of you.

564
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:16,451
Wait. Alice? JULIA:
I talked to her.

565
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:17,887
She's a killing
machine right now.

566
00:34:17,956 --> 00:34:19,652
Tell her you wanna make a deal.

567
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,192
She kills Reynard, she's free.

568
00:34:23,028 --> 00:34:24,052
No.

569
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:29,528
Do it, or we all die
right here, right now, Q.

570
00:34:37,008 --> 00:34:41,378
It's not like you to hide behind
wards, Julia. Come face me.

571
00:34:41,813 --> 00:34:43,042
Face him first.

572
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:45,983
Mmm.

573
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:50,882
You know, even with
that thing inside of him,

574
00:34:50,956 --> 00:34:53,824
he's nowhere near
as interesting as you.

575
00:34:56,394 --> 00:34:58,329
But I'll make do.

576
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:00,092
Let me out. I'll kill him! No.

577
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:03,033
Julia.

578
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:07,782
Get back inside the ward!
Quentin, come on! Come on!

579
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:08,830
Let me out!

580
00:35:11,176 --> 00:35:14,544
Picked up this little trick your
six-fingered friend pulled on me.

581
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:17,709
You waited too long.

582
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,045
You know what's funny, Julia?

583
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:22,820
You work so hard to
hide from me magically,

584
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:24,014
yet you get caught

585
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:28,220
by a simple security
camera, kidnapping a Senator.

586
00:35:29,427 --> 00:35:30,861
It's all over the news.

587
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:33,797
It's grainy, but I'd
recognize you anywhere.

588
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:36,598
So nice to meet
more of your friends.

589
00:35:36,668 --> 00:35:38,933
I think this is gonna
be a lot of fun.

590
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:40,595
We have to stop him.

591
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:49,437
My son.

592
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:51,878
Whatever you are,

593
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:58,051
if I am what you say,
don't hurt these people.

594
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:01,185
Hurt them? No, never.

595
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,689
I froze them so they
wouldn't hurt themselves

596
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:06,954
or you.

597
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:10,859
Come. Come closer.

598
00:36:19,144 --> 00:36:20,144
Damn it!

599
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:44,702
"Praise Ember's strength
and Umber's wisdom."

600
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:56,075
So, magic's back.

601
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:04,922
The fuck...

602
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:25,976
Shit!

603
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,180
What the fuck?

604
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:33,742
It's called the Clean
Room. No magic.

605
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,349
Did you put a sleeping
spell on me? Open this door!

606
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:43,027
I've been trying
to understand you.

607
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,273
At least that's what I thought.

608
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:49,790
What I've really been doing is
trying to make excuses for you.

609
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:54,770
But I can't anymore, not after
what you did to Quentin today.

610
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:57,706
But he's fine, right?

611
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,938
That's just luck,
and you know it.

612
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:03,613
You fed him to Reynard.

613
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:05,914
He knew how to survive.

614
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:08,112
Yeah, by doing what you want!

615
00:38:08,186 --> 00:38:11,020
That's all you see
anymore, is what you want.

616
00:38:11,923 --> 00:38:13,858
You don't feel anymore, Julia,

617
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,126
not the way a human does.

618
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,089
It's not your fault.

619
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:24,302
I hope we can
figure something out.

620
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:30,166
But, until then,
this is it for you.

621
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:31,599
Kady...

622
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:36,940
Citizens. Your
Warrior King returns.

623
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:39,374
Praise Ember! You
scared me, you dick!

624
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,540
Good to see you, too, Bambi.

625
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:46,884
Eliot, are you
okay? Are you hurt?

626
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:49,918
All in one piece, thanks
to that sword spell of yours.

627
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:53,460
I'm just glad you're
safe. We both are.

628
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:57,858
I can't believe
you actually won!

629
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,738
Is it really that shocking?

630
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:03,331
Having seen how you
fight without magic, yes.

631
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:07,303
Hold up. What's King
Daddy Fuckface doing here?

632
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:09,870
Ah, King Idri is
our honored guest.

633
00:39:10,782 --> 00:39:13,547
What happened to the
whole "one must die" deal?

634
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:14,876
We're kings.

635
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:17,893
What's the point of having
great power if not to right wrongs?

636
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:21,856
We made an agreement.

637
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:26,688
We're getting
married. Wait. What?

638
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:29,361
Uh, hello?

639
00:39:29,434 --> 00:39:32,598
Pregnant wifey,
your dick no workey?

640
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:35,765
Before I flay whoever
neglected to inform me sooner,

641
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,607
apparently, all monarchs on
this glorious, magical planet

642
00:39:40,245 --> 00:39:43,738
are entitled to one of
each, a wife and a husband.

643
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:47,349
So, what, you're all just
gonna shack up together?

644
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:50,479
We're all just one big
royal polyamorous family.

645
00:39:50,555 --> 00:39:53,889
Isn't it great? No one has to die.
Everyone gets what they want.

646
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:56,724
El, can we take a second?

647
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:01,965
What?

648
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:04,400
So you fucked his son, it
doesn't have to be weird.

649
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:06,428
You sure this is a good idea?

650
00:40:07,272 --> 00:40:08,865
I mean, you're
really doubling up

651
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,909
on Fillorian marriage contracts.

652
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:13,709
Sometimes, you have
to sacrifice for diplomacy.

653
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,673
And just wait until we're
husband and husband.

654
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:20,617
And what some would
call pillow talk, we call...

655
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:24,418
Espionage?
"Diplomatic leverage."

656
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:28,784
Your Highness! Thank
Ember for your safe return.

657
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,658
More good news, the Wellspring
is finally replenishing itself.

658
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:34,894
Good old Tick.

659
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:38,198
Well, everything's
coming up Eliot.

660
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:41,963
Congrats, future hubby,
your half is now shit-free.

661
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:45,172
I'm sorry. His what?

662
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:46,534
That was the deal.

663
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:50,709
Marriage, peace, and
a 50-50 Wellspring split.

664
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,970
So how'd we finally
fix the Wellspring?

665
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,482
Well...

666
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:20,875
I am so sorry.

667
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,215
I just can't do this anymore.

668
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:45,268
Alice,

669
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:49,266
I hope you meant it.

670
00:41:51,676 --> 00:41:55,704
I hope you just go
and do beautiful magic.

671
00:41:57,882 --> 00:41:58,882
Alice,

672
00:42:04,122 --> 00:42:05,420
Quentin says go free.
