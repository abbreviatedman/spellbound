00:00:03,271 --> 00:00:05,104
- Fuck!
- I'm so sorry.

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,173
It's Reynard. He's back.

4
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:08,574
Wait, I am pregnant.

5
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:11,377
I wasn't the only one
he raped that night,

6
00:00:11,655 --> 00:00:14,423
but I was the only one who got pregnant.

7
00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:16,792
This is exorcism, you understand?

8
00:00:16,827 --> 00:00:18,894
Did it work? Is it gone?

9
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:22,564
In the center of your being,
there's a tiny beating heart.

10
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:25,701
It's called a shade.
It's what makes you feel.

11
00:00:25,736 --> 00:00:28,270
The pain will burn you
till there's nothing.

12
00:00:28,305 --> 00:00:31,673
There was a complication.
Her shade, it's gone.

13
00:00:31,709 --> 00:00:33,375
I feel light,

14
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,844
like a million pound weight's
off my chest.

15
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:37,679
Say we get the perfect spell,

16
00:00:37,715 --> 00:00:39,681
think about the energy
it'd take to work it.

17
00:00:39,717 --> 00:00:41,917
Dana's baby... his son.

18
00:00:41,952 --> 00:00:43,719
You know, there is
a ton of lore on demigods.

19
00:00:43,754 --> 00:00:45,387
They're powerful in their own right.

20
00:00:45,422 --> 00:00:46,722
We need to find him.

21
00:00:46,757 --> 00:00:48,390
As for Loria...

22
00:00:48,425 --> 00:00:50,292
Some 8,000 troops
are headed to the border.

23
00:00:50,327 --> 00:00:51,626
So we're totally outnumbered.

24
00:00:51,662 --> 00:00:53,829
And of course,
our preparation is affected

25
00:00:53,864 --> 00:00:56,898
by the continued unsteadiness
of the Wellspring.

26
00:00:56,934 --> 00:00:58,867
- Looks like...
- A major drought's hit.

27
00:00:58,902 --> 00:01:01,303
[whoosh]

28
00:01:01,338 --> 00:01:03,905
You can't even get out
of this shoddy little magician.

29
00:01:03,941 --> 00:01:06,541
Free yourself, then find me.

30
00:01:06,577 --> 00:01:08,817
- Alice, we can talk about this.
- Just shut up! Shut up!

31
00:01:08,846 --> 00:01:11,480
This is your body trying
to hold a niffin inside it.

32
00:01:11,515 --> 00:01:14,649
You can't... not for much longer,

33
00:01:14,685 --> 00:01:16,451
or it's gonna kill us both.

34
00:01:18,589 --> 00:01:22,858
[panting]

35
00:01:22,893 --> 00:01:25,861
[groans] Seriously, you guys,
I'm in a cage.

36
00:01:25,896 --> 00:01:29,564
You think this is, uh, a tad redundant?

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,533
- Protocol.
- For werewolves.

38
00:01:31,568 --> 00:01:33,335
Okay, technically, I have

39
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:36,338
sexually transmitted
lycanthropy... a very mild case.

40
00:01:36,373 --> 00:01:38,540
Would've been cool
to actually fully wolf out.

41
00:01:38,575 --> 00:01:39,841
You know...
[howls]

42
00:01:39,877 --> 00:01:41,343
Either way, it's totally curable.

43
00:01:41,378 --> 00:01:44,713
Treatable. There is no actual cure.

44
00:01:44,748 --> 00:01:48,049
Well, silver bullet.

45
00:01:48,085 --> 00:01:49,751
Hey, don't go through my bag.

46
00:01:49,787 --> 00:01:52,921
Quentin, you're dying.

47
00:01:52,956 --> 00:01:54,723
Yeah, well, aren't we all?

48
00:01:54,758 --> 00:01:56,424
You are dying quickly.

49
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,494
You cannot keep this thing
inside you much longer.

50
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,862
Well, I can't let her go.

51
00:02:00,898 --> 00:02:02,864
Which is why you must box her.

52
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,599
I'm not doing that to Alice.

53
00:02:04,635 --> 00:02:06,368
Quentin, there is no more Alice.

54
00:02:06,403 --> 00:02:09,538
This is uncharted territory.
Nobody knows.

55
00:02:09,573 --> 00:02:10,939
Well, I know that
you will be dead in days

56
00:02:10,974 --> 00:02:12,841
if you don't rid yourself of her.

57
00:02:12,876 --> 00:02:15,644
May I help you steal from me?

58
00:02:15,679 --> 00:02:17,846
Nope, I got it.

59
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:22,551
Good luck with all your shit.

64

65
00:02:38,068 --> 00:02:40,669
Thank God they don't have polls here.

66

[droning tone]

67
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,643
That's the third brownout this week.

68
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:51,680
If we don't fix the Wellspring
soon, Your Majesty...

69
00:02:51,715 --> 00:02:53,982
One problem at a time, okay?

70
00:02:54,017 --> 00:02:56,585
Our soldiers are
deserting us in protest,

71
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,054
thanks to Julia
committing tree genocide.

72
00:02:59,089 --> 00:03:00,822
Pardon me, Your Majesty.

73
00:03:00,858 --> 00:03:02,591
For the official records, may I suggest

74
00:03:02,626 --> 00:03:05,026
a slightly less incendiary term?

75
00:03:05,062 --> 00:03:06,928
Perhaps "arbicide"?

76
00:03:06,964 --> 00:03:08,730
Sure, if you can also recommend

77
00:03:08,765 --> 00:03:10,966
how we fight a war without an army.

78
00:03:11,001 --> 00:03:15,470
[strained murmuring]

79
00:03:15,505 --> 00:03:18,874
Your Majesty, there is one option...

80
00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:22,177
- a rather obscure law, based...
- Less words.

81
00:03:22,212 --> 00:03:24,880
One-on-one combat.

82
00:03:24,915 --> 00:03:27,115
Between monarchs.

83
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,850
- A duel?
- El...

84
00:03:28,886 --> 00:03:30,986
With Ess's dad?
He's gotta be at least 50.

85
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:32,888
And I'm pretty buff from all the living

86
00:03:32,923 --> 00:03:34,990
without technology or decent wine.

87
00:03:35,025 --> 00:03:36,491
Slow down.

88
00:03:36,526 --> 00:03:38,560
Is there any rule about not using magic?

89
00:03:38,595 --> 00:03:41,763
- No, Your Majesty.
- Highness, if I may,

90
00:03:41,798 --> 00:03:43,932
there is a reason
we haven't brought up this, uh,

91
00:03:43,967 --> 00:03:45,533
option before,

92
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:48,803
especially since magic
is not completely dependable.

93
00:03:48,839 --> 00:03:51,573
Simply put, you're likely to...

94
00:03:51,608 --> 00:03:53,541
well... die.

95
00:03:53,577 --> 00:03:56,778
Mm-hmm. Tick, if I did this,

96
00:03:56,813 --> 00:03:58,847
how popular would I be?

97
00:03:58,882 --> 00:04:02,450
No king has ever volunteered

98
00:04:02,486 --> 00:04:04,019
for one-on-one combat.

99
00:04:04,054 --> 00:04:06,821
If you were to prevail,
you would easily be

100
00:04:06,857 --> 00:04:09,991
the greatest leader
in Fillorian history.

101
00:04:10,027 --> 00:04:11,192
- The greatest.
- The greatest.

00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:15,597
