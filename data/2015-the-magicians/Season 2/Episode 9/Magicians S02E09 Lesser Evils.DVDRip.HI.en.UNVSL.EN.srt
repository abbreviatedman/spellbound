I'm so sorry.

4
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:07,263
It's Reynard. He's back.

5
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:08,570
Wait, I am pregnant.

6
00:00:09,243 --> 00:00:11,508
I wasn't the only one
he raped that night,

7
00:00:11,578 --> 00:00:13,740
but I was the only
one who got pregnant.

10
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:22,320
In the center of your being,
there's a tiny beating heart.

11
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:24,017
It's called a Shade.

12
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:25,650
It's what makes you feel

13
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:27,558
the pain will burn
you till there's nothing.

14

Her Shade, it's gone.

16
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,032

17
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,592
Like a million-pound
weight's off my chest.

18
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:37,433
Say we get the perfect spell.

19
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:39,632

it'd take to work it.

21
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,673

As for Loria...

25
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:50,247
Some 8,000 troops are
headed to the border.

26
00:00:50,317 --> 00:00:51,477
So we're totally outnumbered.

27
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,749
And, of course, our
preparation is affected

28
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:56,915
by the continued
unsteadiness of the Wellspring.

29
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:58,670

A major drought's hit.

30
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:03,757
You can't even get out of
this shoddy little Magician.

31
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,095
Free yourself. Then find me.

ALICE: Just shut up! Shut up!

to hold a Niffin inside it.

34

You can't.

35
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:14,435

36
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:15,999

fully wolf out, you know? (HOWLS)

44

Either way, it's
totally curable.

45
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:44,568
Treatable. There
is no actual cure.

46

You are dying quickly.

You cannot keep this thing
inside you much longer.

52
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:00,715
Well, I can't let her go.

53
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,813

54
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:04,380

suggest a slightly less incendiary term.

there is a reason we haven't
brought up this option before,

92
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:48,589

not completely dependable.

00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:45,948
If someone had told me a year
ago that I'd be venting to my wife

177
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:49,590
while preparing to do battle on
behalf of my mythical kingdom,

178
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,133
I'd have done a lot more drugs.

179
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:56,133
I have something
that might help.

180
00:08:56,503 --> 00:08:58,995
Great, depending on what
your definition of "help" is.

181
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,135
I know I haven't always
given you reason to trust me.

182
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:07,337
My grandpa forged this
sword for a High King

183
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:09,144
who vanished
without ever claiming it.

184
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,878
Since then, my
family's been saving it

185
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,510
for someone truly worthy.

186
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:17,719
It's beautiful, but I'm
not sure it actually helps.

187
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,071
I'll never learn
a spell in time.

188
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:22,826
It was made for a king, as
was the accompanying spell.

189
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,358
Some sword spells
take weeks to master.

190
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:30,734
Not when it's
written for a king.

191
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:34,070
My grandpa was the royal
family's favorite swordsmith

192
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,632
because he knew
they were, uh, too...

193
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:37,836
Too lazy to learn?

194
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:42,007
Too pre-occupied with
matters of state for busywork.

195
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:46,180
With this spell and this blade,

196
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:48,221
you will be a master swordsman.

197
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:52,956
(CHUCKLES) Insert weak
double entendre I'd have to explain.

198
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:54,317

marginally less fucked now.

put my family first.

206

Okay, is this some
kind of a gag?

225
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,913
Is this a publicity
stunt for a TV show?

226

We're Magicians being hunted

We don't need him.
We need his energy. No.

You die, bigger energy.

That is what we are after
here, people, the energy.

Right now, he's just a
skin sack hiding it from us.

Okay, you'd need
something to hold that energy.

No. We are not... Not

Yeah, get me a meeting.

273
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:51,563

So what do we do when he wakes
up and starts kicking the door?

nothing to do with you.

They can.

And in return?

527
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:42,550
A royal child of Whitespire.

528
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:44,417

eat it, are they?

530
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:50,290
It'll be raised as a Fairy.

531
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:53,160
It will know great knowledge
and even greater power.

00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:54,465

bargain with you. What?

Because you questioned him,
he will only honor the present deal

542
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:29,768
without further amendment,
or there will be no deal at all.

Yeah, died and left
you, what, $20 million?

551
00:29:58,063 --> 00:30:00,032
So what are you saying exactly?

552
00:30:00,098 --> 00:30:02,777
Are you saying I used some kind of
magic spell to kill my parents for money?

No, no.

554
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:08,065
Look, what you have is bigger

555
00:30:09,074 --> 00:30:10,940
than what any Magician can do.

556
00:30:11,443 --> 00:30:14,902
You used your powers, even
without knowing it, to create you.

worship and follow you anywhere.

why the hell did
it take me a year

00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,255
to pass the most boring farm
bill in the history of the Senate?

561
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:30,987

ever sponsored failed?

basically unarmed,

guess you'll spare me

Ah, King Idri is
our honored guest.

702
00:39:10,782 --> 00:39:13,547
What happened to the
whole "one must die" deal?

703
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:14,876
IDRI: We're kings.

704
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:17,893
What's the point of having
great power if not to right wrongs?

705
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:21,856
We made an agreement.

706
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:26,688
We're getting
married. Wait. What?

neglected to inform me sooner,

apparently, all monarchs on
this glorious, magical planet

711
00:39:40,245 --> 00:39:43,738
are entitled to one of
each, a wife and a husband.

712
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:47,349
So, what, you're all just
gonna shack up together?

713
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:50,479
We're all just one big
royal polyamorous family.

You sure this is a good idea?

720
00:40:07,272 --> 00:40:08,865
I mean, you're
really doubling up

721
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,909
on Fillorian marriage contracts.

722
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:13,709
Sometimes, you have
to sacrifice for diplomacy.

IDRI: That was the deal.

733

Marriage, peace, and
a 50-50 Wellspring split.

734
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,970

fix the Wellspring?
