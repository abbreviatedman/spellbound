1
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:03,209
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:03,471 --> 00:00:05,304
- Fuck!
- I'm so sorry.

3
00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:07,373
It's Reynard. He's back.

4
00:00:07,408 --> 00:00:08,774
Wait, I am pregnant.

5
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:11,577
I wasn't the only one
he raped that night,

6
00:00:11,855 --> 00:00:14,623
but I was the only one who got pregnant.

7
00:00:14,658 --> 00:00:16,992
This is exorcism, you understand?

8
00:00:17,027 --> 00:00:19,094
Did it work? Is it gone?

9
00:00:19,129 --> 00:00:22,764
In the center of your being,
there's a tiny beating heart.

10
00:00:22,799 --> 00:00:25,901
It's called a shade.
It's what makes you feel.

11
00:00:25,936 --> 00:00:28,470
The pain will burn you
till there's nothing.

12
00:00:28,505 --> 00:00:31,873
There was a complication.
Her shade, it's gone.

13
00:00:31,909 --> 00:00:33,575
I feel light,

14
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,044
like a million pound weight's
off my chest.

15
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,879
Say we get the perfect spell,

16
00:00:37,915 --> 00:00:39,881
think about the energy
it'd take to work it.

17
00:00:39,917 --> 00:00:42,117
Dana's baby... his son.

18
00:00:42,152 --> 00:00:43,919
You know, there is
a ton of lore on demigods.

19
00:00:43,954 --> 00:00:45,587
They're powerful in their own right.

20
00:00:45,622 --> 00:00:46,922
We need to find him.

21
00:00:46,957 --> 00:00:48,590
As for Loria...

22
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:50,492
Some 8,000 troops
are headed to the border.

23
00:00:50,527 --> 00:00:51,826
So we're totally outnumbered.

24
00:00:51,862 --> 00:00:54,029
And of course,
our preparation is affected

25
00:00:54,064 --> 00:00:57,098
by the continued unsteadiness
of the Wellspring.

26
00:00:57,134 --> 00:00:59,067
- Looks like...
- A major drought's hit.

27
00:01:01,538 --> 00:01:04,105
You can't even get out
of this shoddy little magician.

28
00:01:04,141 --> 00:01:06,741
Free yourself, then find me.

29
00:01:06,777 --> 00:01:09,017
- Alice, we can talk about this.
- Just shut up! Shut up!

30
00:01:09,046 --> 00:01:11,680
This is your body trying
to hold a niffin inside it.

31
00:01:11,715 --> 00:01:14,849
You can't... not for much longer,

32
00:01:14,885 --> 00:01:16,651
or it's gonna kill us both.

33
00:01:23,093 --> 00:01:26,061
Seriously, you guys, I'm in a cage.

34
00:01:26,096 --> 00:01:29,764
You think this is, uh, a tad redundant?

35
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,733
- Protocol.
- For werewolves.

36
00:01:31,768 --> 00:01:33,535
Okay, technically, I have

37
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,538
sexually transmitted
lycanthropy... a very mild case.

38
00:01:36,573 --> 00:01:38,740
Would've been cool
to actually fully wolf out.

39
00:01:38,775 --> 00:01:40,041
You know...

40
00:01:40,077 --> 00:01:41,543
Either way, it's totally curable.

41
00:01:41,578 --> 00:01:44,913
Treatable. There is no actual cure.

42
00:01:44,948 --> 00:01:48,249
Well, silver bullet.

43
00:01:48,285 --> 00:01:49,951
Hey, don't go through my bag.

44
00:01:49,987 --> 00:01:53,121
Quentin, you're dying.

45
00:01:53,156 --> 00:01:54,923
Yeah, well, aren't we all?

46
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:56,624
You are dying quickly.

47
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,694
You cannot keep this thing
inside you much longer.

48
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,062
Well, I can't let her go.

49
00:02:01,098 --> 00:02:03,064
Which is why you must box her.

50
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,799
I'm not doing that to Alice.

51
00:02:04,835 --> 00:02:06,568
Quentin, there is no more Alice.

52
00:02:06,603 --> 00:02:09,738
This is uncharted territory.
Nobody knows.

53
00:02:09,773 --> 00:02:11,139
Well, I know that
you will be dead in days

54
00:02:11,174 --> 00:02:13,041
if you don't rid yourself of her.

55
00:02:13,076 --> 00:02:15,844
May I help you steal from me?

56
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:18,046
Nope, I got it.

57
00:02:19,249 --> 00:02:22,751
Good luck with all your shit.

58
00:02:27,057 --> 00:02:29,824
These damn brownouts.

59
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:34,996
We may be the least trusted monarchs

60
00:02:35,032 --> 00:02:38,233
in the history of Fillory.

61
00:02:38,268 --> 00:02:40,869
Thank God they don't have polls here.

62
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,843
That's the third brownout this week.

63
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,880
If we don't fix the Wellspring
soon, Your Majesty...

64
00:02:51,915 --> 00:02:54,182
One problem at a time, okay?

65
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:56,785
Our soldiers are
deserting us in protest,

66
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,254
thanks to Julia
committing tree genocide.

67
00:02:59,289 --> 00:03:01,022
Pardon me, Your Majesty.

68
00:03:01,058 --> 00:03:02,791
For the official records, may I suggest

69
00:03:02,826 --> 00:03:05,226
a slightly less incendiary term?

70
00:03:05,262 --> 00:03:07,128
Perhaps "arbicide"?

71
00:03:07,164 --> 00:03:08,930
Sure, if you can also recommend

72
00:03:08,965 --> 00:03:11,166
how we fight a war without an army.

73
00:03:15,705 --> 00:03:19,074
Your Majesty, there is one option...

74
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:22,377
- a rather obscure law, based...
- Less words.

75
00:03:22,412 --> 00:03:25,080
One-on-one combat.

76
00:03:25,115 --> 00:03:27,315
Between monarchs.

77
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,050
- A duel?
- El...

78
00:03:29,086 --> 00:03:31,186
With Ess's dad?
He's gotta be at least 50.

79
00:03:31,221 --> 00:03:33,088
And I'm pretty buff from all the living

80
00:03:33,123 --> 00:03:35,190
without technology or decent wine.

81
00:03:35,225 --> 00:03:36,691
Slow down.

82
00:03:36,726 --> 00:03:38,760
Is there any rule about not using magic?

83
00:03:38,795 --> 00:03:41,963
- No, Your Majesty.
- Highness, if I may,

84
00:03:41,998 --> 00:03:44,132
there is a reason
we haven't brought up this, uh,

85
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:45,733
option before,

86
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:49,003
especially since magic
is not completely dependable.

87
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:51,773
Simply put, you're likely to...

88
00:03:51,808 --> 00:03:53,741
well... die.

89
00:03:53,777 --> 00:03:56,978
Mm-hmm. Tick, if I did this,

90
00:03:57,013 --> 00:03:59,047
how popular would I be?

91
00:03:59,082 --> 00:04:02,650
No king has ever volunteered

92
00:04:02,686 --> 00:04:04,219
for one-on-one combat.

93
00:04:04,254 --> 00:04:07,021
If you were to prevail,
you would easily be

94
00:04:07,057 --> 00:04:10,191
the greatest leader
in Fillorian history.

95
00:04:10,227 --> 00:04:11,392
- The greatest.
- The greatest.

96
00:04:11,428 --> 00:04:12,894
God,

97
00:04:12,929 --> 00:04:15,797
he's already seeing the statues.

98
00:04:15,832 --> 00:04:17,532
I hereby decree...

99
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:20,868
rulers done gonna rumble.

100
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,683
Eliot's the king of all this?

101
00:04:35,719 --> 00:04:39,154
Yeah, looking for rock-solid
proof there's no justice, that.

102
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:42,090
Even this dungeon's nicer than
any place I lived as a kid...

103
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:44,225
oh, except for my uncle's BMW.

104
00:04:44,261 --> 00:04:46,661
Would've been even nicer
if he'd actually been my uncle.

105
00:04:48,765 --> 00:04:50,632
Don't be fooled by the high gloss.

106
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:52,167
This place sucks.

107
00:04:55,672 --> 00:04:58,073
- Hey.
- What's up?

108
00:04:58,108 --> 00:05:00,008
We found Reynard's son.

109
00:05:00,043 --> 00:05:01,743
So this is a breakout.

110
00:05:01,778 --> 00:05:03,978
- Why are you in here anyway?
- I killed trees.

111
00:05:04,014 --> 00:05:06,815
- Seriously.
- That could talk.

112
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,684
They have talking trees here?

113
00:05:09,719 --> 00:05:10,885
Not anymore.

114
00:05:13,423 --> 00:05:15,190
So what's Reynard's son like?

115
00:05:15,225 --> 00:05:17,125
I guarantee you won't believe it.

116
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,328
Let's go.

117
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,803
What the fuck?

118
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:31,873
He's marking his territory.

119
00:05:31,908 --> 00:05:34,109
Hey, I refuse to be shamed.

120
00:05:34,144 --> 00:05:36,411
Didn't you hear what Friar Joseph said?

121
00:05:36,446 --> 00:05:38,413
Not all niffins are the same.

122
00:05:38,448 --> 00:05:40,148
I'm not gonna go on some killing spree

123
00:05:40,183 --> 00:05:42,817
anymore than he would.

124
00:05:42,853 --> 00:05:46,688
Q... don't you believe me?

125
00:05:46,723 --> 00:05:49,057
I believe you believe you.

126
00:05:49,092 --> 00:05:52,060
Sorry?

127
00:05:52,095 --> 00:05:55,063
I'm not talking to you.

128
00:05:57,701 --> 00:05:59,734
I just want to do what Joseph does.

129
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:02,303
Please. Beautiful, high-level magic.

130
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:05,273
I'm not letting you loose.

131
00:06:05,308 --> 00:06:07,775
It's bad for the world.

132
00:06:09,746 --> 00:06:12,380
I'm not boxing you.

133
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:17,051
I don't want to know
a world without Alice.

134
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:21,089
Keep this up, and you won't have to.

135
00:06:21,124 --> 00:06:23,324
We'll both be dead.

136
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,126
Good plan.

137
00:06:32,135 --> 00:06:33,835
Eliot...

138
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,004
The intel I'm getting on King Idri

139
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:39,274
and the protocols of dueling...
not good.

140
00:06:39,309 --> 00:06:41,776
I mean, you ever even touched
a sword before today?

141
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:45,046
No, but... Magician.

142
00:06:45,081 --> 00:06:46,447
Well, sword fighting spells,

143
00:06:46,483 --> 00:06:49,717
of which there are only two
anyone knows of,

144
00:06:49,753 --> 00:06:51,719
take months to master.

145
00:06:51,755 --> 00:06:54,822
Why? It's a giant butter knife.

146
00:06:57,227 --> 00:07:00,728
It's all the variables
in any given match.

147
00:07:00,764 --> 00:07:03,031
It's almost infinite.

148
00:07:03,066 --> 00:07:06,134
I mean, sure, you could
slap together spell,

149
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:09,837
maybe get four or five good moves.

150
00:07:09,873 --> 00:07:13,942
- Which brings us to thing two.
- How many things are there?

151
00:07:13,977 --> 00:07:18,746
Look, King Idri has fought 14 duels.

152
00:07:18,782 --> 00:07:20,448
All opponents dead.

153
00:07:25,264 --> 00:07:27,248
Senator Gaines' rise has been described

154
00:07:27,368 --> 00:07:29,094
<i>as nothing less than meteoric.</i>

155
00:07:29,353 --> 00:07:31,328
Reynard's son is John Gaines?

156
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,911
- You know him?
- I mean, I know who he is.

157
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,880
He's on rails to the White House.

158
00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:39,316
I hit one of his rallies,
did a psychic scan.

159
00:07:39,384 --> 00:07:41,551
Dude believes every word he says.

160
00:07:48,527 --> 00:07:52,295
<i>I believe that everyone is
born with a flame of goodness,</i>

161
00:07:52,364 --> 00:07:56,306
<i>and if my light or yours go out,</i>

162
00:07:56,735 --> 00:07:59,769
<i>remember, we're not alone in this world.</i>

163
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,575
- See?
- Wow.

164
00:08:05,644 --> 00:08:09,045
He's the perfect demigod
spokesmodel of absolute evil.

165
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:12,048
Who's kinda hot as shit.

166
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:14,084
- What?
- Sorry.

167
00:08:14,152 --> 00:08:16,686
Look, he's not even my type,
obviously; it's... it's weird.

168
00:08:16,755 --> 00:08:18,455
Dude has more magic coming off him

169
00:08:18,523 --> 00:08:21,324
than every Magician on Earth combined

170
00:08:21,393 --> 00:08:23,727
and knows not one thing about magic.

171
00:08:26,031 --> 00:08:28,698
Well, he's sure gonna.

172
00:08:39,745 --> 00:08:41,745
How's the battle prep?

173
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,780
If someone had told me a year ago

174
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:45,949
that I'd be venting to my wife,

175
00:08:46,018 --> 00:08:52,355
while preparing to do battle on
behalf of my mythical kingdom...

176
00:08:52,424 --> 00:08:54,457
I'd have done a lot more drugs.

177
00:08:54,526 --> 00:08:55,992
I have something that might help.

178
00:08:56,061 --> 00:08:59,629
Great, depending on
what your definition of help is.

179
00:08:59,698 --> 00:09:04,034
I know I haven't always
given you reason to trust me.

180
00:09:04,102 --> 00:09:07,037
My grandpa forged this sword
for a High King

181
00:09:07,105 --> 00:09:08,772
who vanished without ever claiming it.

182
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,741
Since then, my family's been saving it

183
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:14,577
for someone truly worthy.

184
00:09:14,646 --> 00:09:17,414
It's beautiful, but
I'm not sure it actually helps.

185
00:09:17,482 --> 00:09:19,015
I'll never learn a spell in time.

186
00:09:19,084 --> 00:09:22,685
It was made for a king,
as was the accompanying spell.

187
00:09:25,857 --> 00:09:28,491
And sword spells take weeks to master.

188
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,560
Not when it's written for a king.

189
00:09:30,629 --> 00:09:33,763
My grandpa was the royal
family's favorite sword smith

190
00:09:33,832 --> 00:09:36,399
because he knew they were, uh, too...

191
00:09:36,468 --> 00:09:40,036
- Too lazy to learn?
- Too... preoccupied

192
00:09:40,105 --> 00:09:43,006
with matters of state for busywork.

193
00:09:43,075 --> 00:09:46,076
With this spell and this blade,

194
00:09:46,144 --> 00:09:48,044
you will be a master swordsman.

195
00:09:49,748 --> 00:09:52,816
Insert weak double entendre
I'd have to explain.

196
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:54,684
Sorry?

197
00:09:54,753 --> 00:09:57,420
"Praise Ember's strength

198
00:09:57,489 --> 00:09:58,888
"and Umber's wisdom.

199
00:09:58,957 --> 00:10:01,157
"Bring unto me the lifeblood knowledge

200
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:04,027
of all masters of the blade
who have come before."

201
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,034
Fen...

202
00:10:11,103 --> 00:10:15,939
Fen, I actually feel
marginally less fucked now.

203
00:10:16,007 --> 00:10:20,110
All my life, I've put my family first.

204
00:10:20,178 --> 00:10:23,680
Now that's you and our baby.

205
00:10:27,486 --> 00:10:29,519
I'll really try not to die again.

206
00:10:29,588 --> 00:10:32,622
I'd really appreciate that.

207
00:10:43,201 --> 00:10:45,969
No, no, no, stop...
hold on... hey, Becky.

208
00:10:46,037 --> 00:10:47,871
Security?

209
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:50,206
- Security?
- It's not working.

210
00:10:52,077 --> 00:10:53,676
All right.

211
00:10:53,745 --> 00:10:57,247
Whatever this is, stop.
Tell me what you want.

212
00:10:57,315 --> 00:11:00,783
- Man, you're good.
- Mm-hmm.

213
00:11:00,852 --> 00:11:02,986
Let's get to it.

214
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,758
Magic is real.

215
00:11:10,095 --> 00:11:12,095
Whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, hey.

216
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:24,107
Okay.

217
00:11:24,176 --> 00:11:27,210
Okay, is this some kind of a gag?

218
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,812
Is this a publicity stunt for a TV show?

219
00:11:29,881 --> 00:11:31,915
We're Magicians
being hunted by an evil God,

220
00:11:31,983 --> 00:11:33,283
and so are you.

221
00:11:33,351 --> 00:11:36,719
Listen, obviously you guys believe this,

222
00:11:36,788 --> 00:11:38,821
- and... and I respect that.
- Bullshit.

223
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,190
No, it is not bullshit. It is... okay.

224
00:11:40,258 --> 00:11:41,991
This'll take forever. It's not like

225
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,627
- we need him alive anyway.
- Jesus, what the fuck, Julia?

226
00:11:44,696 --> 00:11:47,096
We don't need him. We need his energy.

227
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,199
- No.
- You're born, huge energy;

228
00:11:49,267 --> 00:11:52,035
you die, bigger energy,
especially a demigod.

229
00:11:52,103 --> 00:11:54,737
That is what we are
after here, people, the energy.

230
00:11:54,806 --> 00:11:56,806
Right now, he's just a skin sack
hiding it from us.

231
00:11:56,875 --> 00:12:01,578
Okay, you need something
to hold that energy.

232
00:12:01,646 --> 00:12:03,213
- Like this?
- Jesus.

233
00:12:03,281 --> 00:12:05,648
- Oh, my God.
- You planned this all along.

234
00:12:05,717 --> 00:12:07,016
All right, all of you,

235
00:12:07,085 --> 00:12:08,751
get the fuck out of my office now!

236
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,653
I won't die here tonight.

237
00:12:10,722 --> 00:12:13,723
I will not die here!

238
00:12:15,994 --> 00:12:17,860
Oh, shit.

239
00:12:21,566 --> 00:12:23,066
He's okay.

240
00:12:23,134 --> 00:12:24,934
He just fainted.

241
00:12:25,003 --> 00:12:26,536
- Hey!
- Whoa! No.

242
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:30,717
We are not,<i> not,</i> killing a U.S. senator.

243
00:12:32,344 --> 00:12:36,348
But we will commit a felony
almost as stupid.

244
00:12:38,752 --> 00:12:40,052
Ok sloth,

245
00:12:40,172 --> 00:12:42,014
you're the most honest one
on the damn council,

246
00:12:42,064 --> 00:12:45,622
so I'm counting on you to not
kiss my ass or cover yours.

247
00:12:46,115 --> 00:12:48,615
We've got a sword spell, so yay us.

248
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,584
But we need the Wellspring to work.

249
00:12:50,653 --> 00:12:54,221
There can't be one brownout
or blip during the duel.

250
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:58,225
So straight-up,
how do we guarantee that?

251
00:13:01,463 --> 00:13:03,564
- It's too...
- What?

252
00:13:03,632 --> 00:13:06,667
Um...

253
00:13:06,735 --> 00:13:08,969
There is something,

254
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,305
but we urge you not to do it.

255
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:14,074
- Tell me.
- Petition the fairies?

256
00:13:14,143 --> 00:13:17,544
Fairies?

257
00:13:17,613 --> 00:13:21,081
Do I know about the fairies?

258
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:24,418
They exist outside our realm.

259
00:13:24,486 --> 00:13:28,422
They can be contacted,
and they have great powers.

260
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,223
Well, can they fix the Wellspring?

261
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:32,759
Almost certainly.

262
00:13:32,828 --> 00:13:34,628
Guys? The fuck?

263
00:13:34,697 --> 00:13:39,499
Uh, fairies are notoriously...

264
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:42,069
- mercurial?
- Have ya met your king?

265
00:13:42,137 --> 00:13:46,340
They make complex deals
with steep prices and...

266
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,208
Yeah, get me a meeting.

267
00:13:48,277 --> 00:13:51,111
One has to contact their ambassador,

268
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:55,115
a human, which can sometimes
take days, even weeks.

269
00:13:55,184 --> 00:13:57,284
Well, then chop-chop.

270
00:13:57,353 --> 00:14:00,587
And never keep information
from me again, okay?

271
00:14:00,656 --> 00:14:02,189
Yes, Your Highness.

272
00:14:02,257 --> 00:14:04,558
You, Sloth, you read me?

273
00:14:12,267 --> 00:14:14,234
- What?
- Nothing.

274
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:19,473
Is that that senator dude?

275
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,141
You think we kidnapped a U.S. senator

276
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:22,676
and stuffed him in a closet?

277
00:14:22,745 --> 00:14:25,379
No. Jesus, of course not.

278
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,747
Okay.

279
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,349
How'd you get him past the wards?

280
00:14:29,418 --> 00:14:32,285
Hey, does one of you have an alumni key?

281
00:14:32,354 --> 00:14:35,322
So cool. Um, can I borrow it sometime?

282
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:37,311
There's this really hot...
I'd love to sneak her...

283
00:14:37,359 --> 00:14:40,060
Ah, vodka Gibson, four onions.

284
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:43,263
Yeah, right away.

285
00:14:43,332 --> 00:14:45,766
So what do we do when he wakes
up and starts kicking the door?

286
00:14:45,834 --> 00:14:48,735
Whatever it is has
nothing to do with you.

287
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:51,104
Stay away from him.

288
00:14:51,173 --> 00:14:52,305
Or?

289
00:14:52,374 --> 00:14:54,241
No, you don't want to go there.

290
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,246
Pretty sure we're already there.

291
00:14:59,314 --> 00:15:01,148
Enough.

292
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,152
I'll keep an eye on the senator.

293
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,187
- She's psychotic.
- Look, she's being

294
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:10,190
a little... extreme, yeah,

295
00:15:10,259 --> 00:15:13,560
but she's got her reasons, okay?
Just trust me.

296
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:16,530
- I know Julia.
- That's not Julia.

297
00:15:16,598 --> 00:15:19,232
Even she knows that.

298
00:15:19,301 --> 00:15:21,268
The only person who doesn't seem
to know that is you.

299
00:15:31,246 --> 00:15:33,613
Looks good.

300
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,649
- What's wrong?
- Wrong?

301
00:15:35,718 --> 00:15:40,687
Your face...
I'm an obsessive fan, so tell.

302
00:15:40,756 --> 00:15:42,656
Thank you, Soren.

303
00:15:44,626 --> 00:15:46,693
The sword's good.

304
00:15:46,762 --> 00:15:49,429
The spell makes me great,
but great enough?

305
00:15:49,498 --> 00:15:50,797
If I lose, forget me.

306
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,933
All of you are dead or imprisoned.

307
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,841
Why didn't I see how huge this is?

308
00:16:00,909 --> 00:16:03,810
I'm...

309
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,279
I'm scared...

310
00:16:06,348 --> 00:16:08,281
for all of us.

311
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:11,218
You know what I'm thinking about?

312
00:16:11,286 --> 00:16:12,652
That video you showed me

313
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:15,355
of your high school
production of "Les Mis."

314
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:19,392
You were such a great Valjean.

315
00:16:19,461 --> 00:16:20,794
Ugh.

316
00:16:20,863 --> 00:16:24,531
I was all right at the matinees.

317
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,566
Evenings I'd agree.

318
00:16:26,635 --> 00:16:28,335
- I scaled the heights.
- Mm.

319
00:16:28,403 --> 00:16:30,537
But...

320
00:16:30,606 --> 00:16:32,372
what's your point?

321
00:16:32,441 --> 00:16:35,609
Well, all this reading
we've been doing on war,

322
00:16:35,677 --> 00:16:38,311
I keep coming across soldiers who'd sing

323
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,380
before going into battle.

324
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:42,582
To avoid throwing up with fear?

325
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:45,352
It built confidence, yes,

326
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,921
projected power, destabilized the enemy.

327
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:50,190
So give me.

328
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,658
What?

329
00:16:51,727 --> 00:16:53,393
The big number.

330
00:16:55,564 --> 00:16:57,397
I can't.

331
00:16:57,466 --> 00:17:01,268
I'll never remember all the lyrics.

332
00:17:01,336 --> 00:17:03,703
It's practically the entire cast.

333
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,505
Which is why...

334
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:09,376
Magic.

335
00:17:10,846 --> 00:17:13,213
No, I should practice.

336
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,248
So move your ass and sing.

337
00:17:15,317 --> 00:17:17,918
Beyoncé does, which is why she's a boss.

338
00:17:17,986 --> 00:17:20,320

I'm confused.

394
00:20:23,905 --> 00:20:26,606
- Is the duel not today?
- It's a metaphor.

395
00:20:26,675 --> 00:20:28,842
- I love that show.
- You know it?

396
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:31,778
Boarding school on Earth.
I played Javert.

397
00:20:31,847 --> 00:20:35,515
Typecasting.

398
00:20:39,021 --> 00:20:40,487
Praise Ember's strength
and Umber's wisdom.

399
00:20:40,555 --> 00:20:41,788
Bring unto me the lifeblood knowledge

400
00:20:41,857 --> 00:20:43,023
of all masters of the blade.

401
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,729
King Idri...

402
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,634
King Eliot...

403
00:20:54,703 --> 00:20:56,569
I'm sorry I have to kill you.

404
00:20:56,638 --> 00:20:57,971
I've died before.

405
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,041
Doesn't seem to take with me.

406
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:02,609
Shall we?

407
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,491
Ah!

408
00:21:31,606 --> 00:21:33,807
Okay, is he allowed to do that?

409
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,942
Kings do whatever.

410
00:21:36,011 --> 00:21:38,011
Fine, he bitched out. It's over.

411
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,247
It's over when one ruler is dead.

412
00:21:41,316 --> 00:21:43,583
Another favorite show of mine...

413
00:21:43,652 --> 00:21:45,696
"Into the Woods."

414
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:01,700
I cannot believe how
fucking boring this is.

415
00:22:05,272 --> 00:22:07,672
You know I can see magic?

416
00:22:09,743 --> 00:22:11,446
Not the kind that
you can do with your hands...

417
00:22:11,471 --> 00:22:13,378
that Stone Age bullshit.

418
00:22:13,414 --> 00:22:16,148
I can see pure magic

419
00:22:16,183 --> 00:22:20,952
in a thousand dimensions all at once.

420
00:22:20,988 --> 00:22:22,654
You're not Quentin.

421
00:22:22,689 --> 00:22:25,824
Get me out of here.

422
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:27,025
Alice.

423
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,394
Quentin always said you were smart.

424
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:31,163
He said the same about you.

425
00:22:31,198 --> 00:22:33,298
Well, then, between the two of us,

426
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:36,001
we should be able
to figure something out.

427
00:22:36,036 --> 00:22:38,403
I'm not sure that's what Q would want.

428
00:22:38,439 --> 00:22:40,672
What do you want, Julia?

429
00:22:40,707 --> 00:22:44,409
What are you thinking?

430
00:22:44,445 --> 00:22:48,146
Oh, I can almost see it...

431
00:22:48,182 --> 00:22:52,017
just like I can see
that your shade is gone,

432
00:22:52,052 --> 00:22:55,020
which is how I know that your...

433
00:22:55,055 --> 00:22:58,824
thoughts are pure, unencumbered.

434
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:01,226
I'm right, aren't I?

435
00:23:01,261 --> 00:23:05,030
We both no life
is not clouded with regret,

436
00:23:05,065 --> 00:23:08,333
need, sadness.

437
00:23:08,368 --> 00:23:13,205
We both know life is
crystalline, clear, cold, sharp.

438
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,373
You...

439
00:23:15,409 --> 00:23:18,043
he's bleeding.

440
00:23:18,078 --> 00:23:20,412
God, he's so weak.

441
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,195
<i>John, I'm here.</i>

442
00:23:37,231 --> 00:23:40,031
<i>I know you have questions.</i>

443
00:23:40,067 --> 00:23:43,034
<i>I have all the answers
you could ever want.</i>

444
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:45,036
I'm Reynard.

445
00:23:45,072 --> 00:23:47,706
<i>Your place is with me.</i>

446
00:23:53,747 --> 00:23:56,281
Who the fuck is Reynard,
and why is he in my head?

447
00:24:00,153 --> 00:24:03,021
There's nothing we can do.

448
00:24:03,056 --> 00:24:04,723
It's up to him.

449
00:24:04,758 --> 00:24:06,424
- Jesus, he's stubborn.
- What is happening?

450
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,193
What is happening?
Will you get him out of my head?

451
00:24:08,228 --> 00:24:10,061
- Make it stop.
- What now?

452
00:24:10,097 --> 00:24:12,163
This is so much worse than you think.

453
00:24:12,199 --> 00:24:14,132
- Is that Senator Gaines?
- Probably.

454
00:24:14,167 --> 00:24:15,934
I mean, why not?

455
00:24:15,969 --> 00:24:18,236
Can you do something
to ward his mind from the voice?

456
00:24:18,272 --> 00:24:20,438
- What voice?
- Reynard's.

457
00:24:20,474 --> 00:24:22,474
- He's after his son.
- Where?

458
00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:26,011
Outside the wards, I guess.

459
00:24:26,046 --> 00:24:28,980
Okay, whatever you're thinking, don't.

460
00:24:29,016 --> 00:24:30,515
I'm not the one you should worry about.

461
00:24:52,239 --> 00:24:55,006
You are out of your element,
child of Earth.

462
00:24:58,512 --> 00:25:00,946
Well done.

463
00:25:00,981 --> 00:25:02,447
Well done.

464
00:25:06,186 --> 00:25:09,554
Yes.

465
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:14,526
I'd give you an update,
but I hate seeing boys cry.

466
00:25:14,561 --> 00:25:17,162
He won't be able to get in here,

467
00:25:17,197 --> 00:25:21,299
not after the security protocols
we put in place after The Beast.

468
00:25:21,335 --> 00:25:24,002
As long as they hold, we're safe.

469
00:25:24,037 --> 00:25:26,504
You're probably right.
I hope you're right,

470
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,007
but we are talking about
a not-so-benevolent god...

471
00:25:29,042 --> 00:25:32,344
- Mm.
- After his only child.

472
00:25:32,379 --> 00:25:36,081
Listen, I'm sorry for getting
so hysterical back there.

473
00:25:36,116 --> 00:25:37,816
I'm having a lot of trouble with this.

474
00:25:37,851 --> 00:25:39,217
It's okay.

475
00:25:39,252 --> 00:25:40,552
How did you get his voice to stop?

476
00:25:40,587 --> 00:25:42,921
What the hell is this thing on my neck?

477
00:25:42,956 --> 00:25:44,956
It's a patch.
It blocks psychic interference.

478
00:25:44,992 --> 00:25:46,958
It works, trust me.

479
00:25:46,994 --> 00:25:50,195
I have to be honest.
I hope I'm in a mental ward.

480
00:25:52,332 --> 00:25:54,566
Majesty, you must return to Whitespire.

481
00:25:54,601 --> 00:25:57,002
- Are you insane?
- He will not wait.

482
00:25:57,037 --> 00:25:59,504
- Who?
- The ambassador to the fairies.

483
00:26:04,077 --> 00:26:08,313
I'm afraid this has to end!

484
00:26:08,348 --> 00:26:11,216
Don't prolong it.

485
00:26:11,251 --> 00:26:13,018
Monarch to monarch,

486
00:26:13,053 --> 00:26:16,121
when I kill you, I'll be merciful.

487
00:26:16,156 --> 00:26:18,023
That's kind of you.

488
00:26:31,471 --> 00:26:34,472
Oh, shit.

489
00:26:34,508 --> 00:26:36,908
- The Wellspring.
- Shit.

490
00:26:41,581 --> 00:26:43,548
Praise Ember's strength
and Umber's wisdom.

491
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:45,483
Bring unto me the lifeblood knowledge

492
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:48,353
of all...

493
00:26:56,263 --> 00:26:57,529
All right, come on.

494
00:27:09,109 --> 00:27:11,076
Blackout. The wards are down.

495
00:27:11,111 --> 00:27:14,212
Everyone get to the lab. Now!

496
00:27:18,118 --> 00:27:20,285
- Let's go.
- Run!

497
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,087
What's happening?

498
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:34,968
- Move, people! Quickly!
- Inside! Lets go!

499
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:37,088
Come on, this aint a pop quiz, let's go,

500
00:27:37,112 --> 00:27:39,171
you don't want to be out there,
let's go, come on!

501
00:27:39,307 --> 00:27:41,907
How long can the emergency generator
in here keep the lab working?

502
00:27:41,984 --> 00:27:44,326
Hopefully long enough till
we think of something.

503
00:28:03,771 --> 00:28:06,371
Of course those I represent
would always consider

504
00:28:06,407 --> 00:28:07,892
with the utmost respect

505
00:28:08,244 --> 00:28:10,656
any royal request, Your Majesty.

506
00:28:12,115 --> 00:28:14,382
When can we meet face-to-face?

507
00:28:14,417 --> 00:28:17,518
When you conclude the bargain with me.

508
00:28:17,554 --> 00:28:19,053
No.

509
00:28:19,089 --> 00:28:22,023
I wanna know
who I'm sealing the deal with.

510
00:28:22,058 --> 00:28:24,125
Not possible, Majesty.

511
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:28,630
The ways of the fairies are...
well, how should I put it...

512
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:31,499
as implacable as they are ancient.

513
00:28:31,534 --> 00:28:35,236
In any case, I would imagine
time is of the essence, no?

514
00:28:35,271 --> 00:28:37,705
The fairies can bring back
the Wellspring?

515
00:28:37,741 --> 00:28:39,173
They can.

516
00:28:39,209 --> 00:28:41,042
And in return?

517
00:28:41,077 --> 00:28:43,211
A royal child of Whitespire.

518
00:28:43,246 --> 00:28:46,681
The fairies want a baby?

519
00:28:46,716 --> 00:28:49,017
They aren't gonna eat it, are they?

520
00:28:49,052 --> 00:28:51,019
It'll be raised as a fairy.

521
00:28:51,054 --> 00:28:53,521
It'll know great knowledge,
and even greater power.

522
00:28:53,556 --> 00:28:58,426
Well... I'm not loving this,

523
00:28:58,461 --> 00:29:01,529
- but I could get knocked up...
- No.

524
00:29:01,564 --> 00:29:05,166
The child that grows in the womb
of the High King's wife.

525
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:07,168
Are you fucking kidding me?

526
00:29:10,607 --> 00:29:13,508
Highness? A word?

527
00:29:15,645 --> 00:29:18,613
You've offended the ambassador.

528
00:29:18,648 --> 00:29:21,082
He will no longer bargain with you.

529
00:29:21,117 --> 00:29:23,618
- What?
- Because you question him,

530
00:29:23,653 --> 00:29:26,354
he will only honor the present deal

531
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:31,059
without further amendment,
or there will be no deal at all.

532
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:40,435
I do not have powers.
That is impossible.

533
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:43,004
It's impossible you don't.

534
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,473
- Look at your career.
- Hey, I work hard.

535
00:29:45,508 --> 00:29:48,042
Have you ever failed at anything ever?

536
00:29:48,078 --> 00:29:50,678
Just be honest.

537
00:29:50,714 --> 00:29:52,747
I've had losses.

538
00:29:52,782 --> 00:29:54,716
- My parents...
- Yeah, died,

539
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:58,086
and left you, what, $20 million?

540
00:29:58,121 --> 00:30:00,088
So what are you saying exactly?

541
00:30:00,123 --> 00:30:02,323
Are you saying I used
some kind of magic spell

542
00:30:02,358 --> 00:30:04,292
- to kill my parents for money?
- No. No.

543
00:30:04,327 --> 00:30:09,130
Look, what you have,
it is bigger than...

544
00:30:09,165 --> 00:30:11,232
than... than what any Magician can do.

545
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,034
You know, you used your powers

546
00:30:13,069 --> 00:30:16,204
even without knowing it to create you.

547
00:30:16,239 --> 00:30:20,808
And the world was made to
worship and follow you anywhere.

548
00:30:20,844 --> 00:30:24,045
So if my birth father's a god
and I'm a demigod,

549
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,720
why the hell did it take me
a year to pass

550
00:30:25,749 --> 00:30:29,784
the most boring farm bill
in the history of the Senate?

551
00:30:29,819 --> 00:30:32,453
But it got passed, right?

552
00:30:32,489 --> 00:30:34,756
Come on, has any bill
you ever sponsored failed?

553
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:38,092
- Come on.
- Has it?

554
00:30:40,864 --> 00:30:42,730
Holy shit.

555
00:31:03,353 --> 00:31:05,686
Hi.

556
00:31:05,722 --> 00:31:09,791
You can't stay up there forever.

557
00:31:12,629 --> 00:31:15,863
Fen, Eliot's going to lose,

558
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:17,765
if he hasn't already.

559
00:31:17,801 --> 00:31:20,735
Without magic, he's basically unarmed.

560
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:22,703
And the Wellspring's gone black.

561
00:31:22,739 --> 00:31:25,373
You have to do something.

562
00:31:25,408 --> 00:31:27,542
I think I can,

563
00:31:27,577 --> 00:31:32,146
but I need you to promise me
that if magic is returned,

564
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:34,782
Eliot lives and there's no war...

565
00:31:34,818 --> 00:31:37,718
that you will do
exactly what I tell you.

566
00:31:37,754 --> 00:31:40,121
- Of course.
- Whatever it is.

567
00:31:40,156 --> 00:31:42,557
Yes. Please. Don't let him die.

568
00:31:49,632 --> 00:31:51,866
You are most skillful.

569
00:31:51,901 --> 00:31:55,736
I'm a manipulative cunt.

570
00:31:55,772 --> 00:31:59,907
Fix the Wellspring,<i> now.</i>

571
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,926
No rush.

572
00:32:18,962 --> 00:32:20,828
I'll win eventually.

573
00:32:20,864 --> 00:32:23,497
I wish your magic hadn't gone out.

574
00:32:23,533 --> 00:32:25,766
I like my fights fair.

575
00:32:25,802 --> 00:32:28,269
You do realize if this
is a legit magic blackout,

576
00:32:28,304 --> 00:32:30,705
it fucks both Fillory and Loria, right?

577
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,307
My people are so used to scarcity,

578
00:32:33,343 --> 00:32:35,409
I don't even think it'll register.

579
00:32:35,445 --> 00:32:38,613
Sometimes, I think they like
being dissatisfied.

580
00:32:38,648 --> 00:32:41,282
Preach.

581
00:32:41,317 --> 00:32:43,818
If you do kill me,
I guess you'll spare me decades

582
00:32:43,853 --> 00:32:48,322
of trying to fix a kingdom
hell-bent on staying broken,

583
00:32:48,358 --> 00:32:51,626
doomed to sexual frustration.

584
00:32:51,661 --> 00:32:54,362
- But you have a wife.
- Exactly.

585
00:32:54,397 --> 00:32:56,230
Oh, and I'm going to be a father,

586
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:58,733
if that changes your mind about
the whole killing me thing.

587
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:03,204
Wish I had a choice,
but one of us has to die,

588
00:33:03,239 --> 00:33:05,740
and I'm not the one up a tree.

589
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,909
Worth a shot.

590
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:10,978
At least you don't have
to worry about getting old.

591
00:33:11,014 --> 00:33:12,914
Excuse me.

592
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:17,418
I would age like a fine wine.

593
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:21,622
And you are a total DILF.

594
00:33:21,658 --> 00:33:23,524
Should I be offended?

595
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:27,428
Let's just say
it's too bad I have a wife.

596
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:30,998
I get it. My love for my late wife

597
00:33:31,034 --> 00:33:33,734
kept me from selecting a husband too.

598
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:36,938
Um, wait.

599
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,439
What?

600
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:41,909
It is a shame I have to kill you.

601
00:33:41,945 --> 00:33:45,413
I actually find you very attractive.

602
00:33:45,448 --> 00:33:47,615
God damn it.

603
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,617
God damn it!

604
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,921
- Where's Quentin?
- What?

605
00:33:53,957 --> 00:33:56,824
Shit. Julia's not here either.

606
00:33:56,859 --> 00:33:58,492
What?

607
00:34:02,532 --> 00:34:05,533
I don't understand.
You have a new weapon

608
00:34:05,568 --> 00:34:07,868
- to kill Reynard?
- No, you do.

609
00:34:07,904 --> 00:34:10,838
I do what?

610
00:34:10,873 --> 00:34:14,675
You have a nuclear bomb inside of you.

611
00:34:14,711 --> 00:34:16,577
- Wait, Alice?
- I talked to her.

612
00:34:16,612 --> 00:34:17,878
She's a killing machine right now.

613
00:34:17,914 --> 00:34:19,847
Tell her you wanna make a deal.

614
00:34:19,882 --> 00:34:22,917
She kills Reynard, she's free.

615
00:34:22,952 --> 00:34:25,419
No.

616
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:29,857
Do it, or we all die
right here, right now, Q.

617
00:34:36,683 --> 00:34:39,499
It's not like you to
hide behind wards, Julia.

618
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:43,034
- Come face me.
- Face him first.

619
00:34:43,069 --> 00:34:46,871
Mmm.

620
00:34:46,906 --> 00:34:50,375
Even with that... thing inside of him,

621
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:53,778
he's nowhere near as interesting as you.

622
00:34:55,949 --> 00:34:57,915
But I'll make due.

623
00:34:57,951 --> 00:34:59,851
- Let me out, I'll kill him.
- No.

624
00:35:01,554 --> 00:35:05,823
Julia.

625
00:35:05,859 --> 00:35:06,958
- Get back inside the ward!
- Come on!

626
00:35:06,993 --> 00:35:08,493
- Come on!
- Let me out!

627
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:11,963
Picked up this little trick

628
00:35:11,998 --> 00:35:14,065
your six-fingered friend pulled on me.

629
00:35:16,069 --> 00:35:19,337
- You waited too long.
- You know what's funny, Julia?

630
00:35:19,372 --> 00:35:22,340
You work so hard
to hide from me magically,

631
00:35:22,375 --> 00:35:26,144
yet you get caught
by a simple security camera

632
00:35:26,179 --> 00:35:28,913
kidnapping a senator.

633
00:35:28,948 --> 00:35:30,882
It's all over the news.

634
00:35:30,917 --> 00:35:34,018
It's grainy, but I'd
recognize you anywhere.

635
00:35:34,054 --> 00:35:36,387
So nice to meet more of your friends.

636
00:35:36,423 --> 00:35:39,190
I think this is gonna be a lot of fun.

637
00:35:39,225 --> 00:35:40,792
We have to stop him.

638
00:35:47,934 --> 00:35:50,101
My son.

639
00:35:50,136 --> 00:35:53,237
Whatever you are,

640
00:35:53,273 --> 00:35:56,407
if I am what you say,

641
00:35:56,443 --> 00:35:58,109
don't hurt these people.

642
00:35:58,144 --> 00:36:01,512
Hurt them? No. Never.

643
00:36:01,548 --> 00:36:05,383
I froze them so they wouldn't
hurt themselves...

644
00:36:05,418 --> 00:36:07,885
or you.

645
00:36:07,921 --> 00:36:11,089
Come. Come closer.

646
00:36:18,598 --> 00:36:19,997
Damn it!

647
00:36:42,255 --> 00:36:45,323
Praise Ember's strength
and Umber's wisdom.

648
00:36:52,632 --> 00:36:54,599
So...

649
00:36:54,634 --> 00:36:57,502
magic's back.

650
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,530
Shit.

651
00:37:28,568 --> 00:37:29,934
What the fuck?

652
00:37:29,969 --> 00:37:32,403
It's called The Clean Room.

653
00:37:32,438 --> 00:37:34,539
No magic.

654
00:37:34,574 --> 00:37:36,440
Did you put a sleeping spell on me?

655
00:37:36,476 --> 00:37:40,011
Open this door!

656
00:37:40,046 --> 00:37:44,682
I've been trying to understand you.

657
00:37:44,717 --> 00:37:47,318
At least that's what I thought.
What I've really been doing

658
00:37:47,353 --> 00:37:49,620
is trying to make excuses for you.

659
00:37:49,656 --> 00:37:52,390
But I can't anymore,

660
00:37:52,425 --> 00:37:55,927
not after what you did to Quentin today.

661
00:37:55,962 --> 00:37:57,295
But he's fine, right?

662
00:37:57,330 --> 00:38:00,598
That's just luck, and you know it.

663
00:38:00,633 --> 00:38:04,101
You fed him to Reynard.

664
00:38:04,137 --> 00:38:07,638
- He knew how to survive.
- Yeah, by doing what you want.

665
00:38:07,674 --> 00:38:11,375
That's all you see anymore,
is what you want.

666
00:38:11,411 --> 00:38:15,279
You don't feel anymore, Julia,

667
00:38:15,315 --> 00:38:18,416
not the way a human does.

668
00:38:18,451 --> 00:38:22,253
It's not your fault.

669
00:38:22,288 --> 00:38:25,723
I hope we can figure something out,

670
00:38:25,758 --> 00:38:28,492
but until then,

671
00:38:28,528 --> 00:38:30,027
this is it for you.

672
00:38:30,063 --> 00:38:31,762
Kady...

673
00:38:33,333 --> 00:38:36,334
Citizens, your warrior king returns.

674
00:38:36,369 --> 00:38:39,770
- Praise Ember!
- You scared me, you dick.

675
00:38:41,741 --> 00:38:43,608
Good to see you too, Bambi.

676
00:38:43,643 --> 00:38:46,677
Eliot, are... are you okay?
Are you hurt?

677
00:38:46,713 --> 00:38:50,248
All in one piece, thanks
to that sword spell of yours.

678
00:38:50,283 --> 00:38:54,752
I'm just glad you're safe. We both are.

679
00:38:54,787 --> 00:38:58,155
I can't believe you actually won.

680
00:38:58,191 --> 00:39:00,258
Uh, is it really that shocking?

681
00:39:00,293 --> 00:39:02,660
Having seen how you fight
without magic, yes.

682
00:39:02,695 --> 00:39:04,328
Hold up.

683
00:39:04,364 --> 00:39:06,564
What's King Daddy Fuckface doing here?

684
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:10,234
Ah, King Idri is our honored guest.

685
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:13,271
What happened to the whole
"one must die" deal?

686
00:39:13,306 --> 00:39:14,538
We're kings.

687
00:39:14,574 --> 00:39:16,040
What's the point of having great power

688
00:39:16,075 --> 00:39:18,075
if not to right wrongs?

689
00:39:18,111 --> 00:39:20,544
We...

690
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:23,581
made an agreement.

691
00:39:23,616 --> 00:39:26,484
- We're getting married.
- Wait, what?

692
00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:29,120
Uh, hello?

693
00:39:29,155 --> 00:39:32,290
Pregnant wifey? Your dick no work-y?

694
00:39:32,325 --> 00:39:35,192
Before I flay whoever
neglected to inform me sooner,

695
00:39:35,228 --> 00:39:39,664
apparently all monarchs
on this glorious, magical planet

696
00:39:39,699 --> 00:39:41,232
are entitled to one of each.

697
00:39:41,267 --> 00:39:43,534
A wife, and a husband.

698
00:39:43,569 --> 00:39:45,102
So what?

699
00:39:45,138 --> 00:39:46,737
You're all just gonna shack up together?

700
00:39:46,773 --> 00:39:50,107
We're all just one big royal
polyamorous family.

701
00:39:50,143 --> 00:39:51,676
Isn't it great? No one has to die.

702
00:39:51,711 --> 00:39:53,744
Everyone gets what they want.

703
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:56,647
El, can we take a second?

704
00:40:00,653 --> 00:40:02,420
What? So you fucked his son.

705
00:40:02,455 --> 00:40:04,221
It doesn't have to be weird.

706
00:40:04,257 --> 00:40:06,691
You sure this is a good idea?

707
00:40:06,726 --> 00:40:08,326
I mean, you're really doubling up

708
00:40:08,361 --> 00:40:10,695
on Fillorian marriage contracts.

709
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:14,065
Sometimes, you have
to sacrifice for diplomacy.

710
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:16,267
And just wait until
we're husband and husband,

711
00:40:16,302 --> 00:40:20,504
and what some would call
pillow talk, we call...

712
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,406
Espionage?

713
00:40:22,442 --> 00:40:24,675
Diplomatic leverage.

714
00:40:24,711 --> 00:40:26,544
Your Highness!

715
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:29,146
Thank Ember for your safe return.

716
00:40:29,182 --> 00:40:32,583
More good news, the Wellspring
is finally replenishing itself.

717
00:40:32,618 --> 00:40:35,419
Ah, good old Tick.

718
00:40:35,455 --> 00:40:38,122
Well, everything's coming up Eliot.

719
00:40:38,558 --> 00:40:42,052
Congrats, future hubby.
Your half is now shit-free.

720
00:40:42,385 --> 00:40:44,862
I'm sorry, his what?

721
00:40:44,897 --> 00:40:48,247
That was the deal. Marriage, peace,

722
00:40:48,501 --> 00:40:50,747
and a 50/50 Wellspring split.

723
00:40:51,804 --> 00:40:54,271
So how'd we finally fix the Wellspring?

724
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:01,445
Well...

725
00:41:18,865 --> 00:41:20,631
I am so sorry.

726
00:41:25,805 --> 00:41:28,672
I just can't do this anymore.

727
00:41:43,723 --> 00:41:45,286
Alice...

728
00:41:47,627 --> 00:41:49,882
I hope you meant it.

729
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:53,663
I hope you just go and do...

730
00:41:54,267 --> 00:41:56,101
beautiful magic.

731
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:58,470
Alice...

732
00:42:03,576 --> 00:42:06,310
Quentin says go free.
