1
00:00:00,167 --> 00:00:02,209
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:02,471 --> 00:00:04,304
- Fuck!
- I'm so sorry.

3
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:06,173
It's Reynard.
He's back.

4
00:00:06,208 --> 00:00:07,574
Wait, I am pregnant.

5
00:00:07,609 --> 00:00:10,377
I wasn't the only one
he raped that night,

6
00:00:10,655 --> 00:00:13,423
but I was the only one
who got pregnant.

7
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:15,792
This is exorcism,
you understand?

8
00:00:15,827 --> 00:00:17,894
Did it work?
Is it gone?

9
00:00:17,929 --> 00:00:21,564
In the center of your being,
there's a tiny beating heart.

10
00:00:21,599 --> 00:00:24,701
It's called a shade.
It's what makes you feel.

11
00:00:24,736 --> 00:00:27,270
The pain will burn you
till there's nothing.

12
00:00:27,305 --> 00:00:30,673
There was a complication.
Her shade, it's gone.

13
00:00:30,709 --> 00:00:32,375
I feel light,

14
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:34,844
like a million pound weight's
off my chest.

15
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:36,679
Say we get the perfect spell,

16
00:00:36,715 --> 00:00:38,681
think about the energy
it'd take to work it.

17
00:00:38,717 --> 00:00:40,917
Dana's baby--his son.

18
00:00:40,952 --> 00:00:42,719
You know, there is
a ton of lore on demigods.

19
00:00:42,754 --> 00:00:44,387
They're powerful
in their own right.

20
00:00:44,422 --> 00:00:45,722
We need to find him.

21
00:00:45,757 --> 00:00:47,390
As for Loria--

22
00:00:47,425 --> 00:00:49,292
Some 8,000 troops
are headed to the border.

23
00:00:49,327 --> 00:00:50,626
So we're totally outnumbered.

24
00:00:50,662 --> 00:00:52,829
And of course,
our preparation is affected

25
00:00:52,864 --> 00:00:55,898
by the continued unsteadiness
of the Wellspring.

26
00:00:55,934 --> 00:00:57,867
- Looks like...
- A major drought's hit.

27
00:01:00,338 --> 00:01:02,905
You can't even get out
of this shoddy little magician.

28
00:01:02,941 --> 00:01:05,541
Free yourself, then find me.

29
00:01:05,577 --> 00:01:07,817
- Alice, we can talk about this.
- Just shut up! Shut up!

30
00:01:07,846 --> 00:01:10,480
This is your body trying
to hold a niffin inside it.

31
00:01:10,515 --> 00:01:13,649
You can't--
not for much longer,

32
00:01:13,685 --> 00:01:15,451
or it's gonna kill us both.

33
00:01:21,893 --> 00:01:24,861
Seriously, you guys,
I'm in a cage.

34
00:01:24,896 --> 00:01:28,564
You think this is, uh,
a tad redundant?

35
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,533
- Protocol.
- For werewolves.

36
00:01:30,568 --> 00:01:32,335
Okay, technically, I have

37
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,338
sexually transmitted
lycanthropy--a very mild case.

38
00:01:35,373 --> 00:01:37,540
Would've been cool
to actually fully wolf out.

39
00:01:37,575 --> 00:01:38,841
You know...

40
00:01:38,877 --> 00:01:40,343
Either way,
it's totally curable.

41
00:01:40,378 --> 00:01:43,713
Treatable.
There is no actual cure.

42
00:01:43,748 --> 00:01:47,049
Well, silver bullet.

43
00:01:47,085 --> 00:01:48,751
Hey, don't go through my bag.

44
00:01:48,787 --> 00:01:51,921
Quentin, you're dying.

45
00:01:51,956 --> 00:01:53,723
Yeah, well, aren't we all?

46
00:01:53,758 --> 00:01:55,424
You are dying quickly.

47
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,494
You cannot keep this thing
inside you much longer.

48
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,862
Well, I can't let her go.

49
00:01:59,898 --> 00:02:01,864
Which is why you must box her.

50
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,599
I'm not doing that to Alice.

51
00:02:03,635 --> 00:02:05,368
Quentin, there is no more Alice.

52
00:02:05,403 --> 00:02:08,538
This is uncharted territory.
Nobody knows.

53
00:02:08,573 --> 00:02:09,939
Well, I know that
you will be dead in days

54
00:02:09,974 --> 00:02:11,841
if you don't
rid yourself of her.

55
00:02:11,876 --> 00:02:14,644
May I help you steal from me?

56
00:02:14,679 --> 00:02:16,846
Nope, I got it.

57
00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:21,551
Good luck with all your shit.

58
00:02:25,857 --> 00:02:28,624
These damn brownouts.

59
00:02:29,994 --> 00:02:33,796
We may be
the least trusted monarchs

60
00:02:33,832 --> 00:02:37,033
in the history of Fillory.

61
00:02:37,068 --> 00:02:39,669
Thank God
they don't have polls here.

62
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,643
That's the third brownout
this week.

63
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:50,680
If we don't fix the Wellspring
soon, Your Majesty--

64
00:02:50,715 --> 00:02:52,982
One problem at a time, okay?

65
00:02:53,017 --> 00:02:55,585
Our soldiers are
deserting us in protest,

66
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,054
thanks to Julia
committing tree genocide.

67
00:02:58,089 --> 00:02:59,822
Pardon me, Your Majesty.

68
00:02:59,858 --> 00:03:01,591
For the official records,
may I suggest

69
00:03:01,626 --> 00:03:04,026
a slightly less incendiary term?

70
00:03:04,062 --> 00:03:05,928
Perhaps "arbicide"?

71
00:03:05,964 --> 00:03:07,730
Sure, if you can also recommend

72
00:03:07,765 --> 00:03:09,966
how we fight a war
without an army.

73
00:03:14,505 --> 00:03:17,874
Your Majesty,
there is one option--

74
00:03:17,909 --> 00:03:21,177
- a rather obscure law, based--
- Less words.

75
00:03:21,212 --> 00:03:23,880
One-on-one combat.

76
00:03:23,915 --> 00:03:26,115
Between monarchs.

77
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,850
- A duel?
- El--

78
00:03:27,886 --> 00:03:29,986
With Ess's dad?
He's gotta be at least 50.

79
00:03:30,021 --> 00:03:31,888
And I'm pretty buff
from all the living

80
00:03:31,923 --> 00:03:33,990
without technology
or decent wine.

81
00:03:34,025 --> 00:03:35,491
Slow down.

82
00:03:35,526 --> 00:03:37,560
Is there any rule
about not using magic?

83
00:03:37,595 --> 00:03:40,763
- No, Your Majesty.
- Highness, if I may,

84
00:03:40,798 --> 00:03:42,932
there is a reason
we haven't brought up this, uh,

85
00:03:42,967 --> 00:03:44,533
option before,

86
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:47,803
especially since magic
is not completely dependable.

87
00:03:47,839 --> 00:03:50,573
Simply put, you're likely to...

88
00:03:50,608 --> 00:03:52,541
well...die.

89
00:03:52,577 --> 00:03:55,778
Mm-hmm.
Tick, if I did this,

90
00:03:55,813 --> 00:03:57,847
how popular would I be?

91
00:03:57,882 --> 00:04:01,450
No king has ever volunteered

92
00:04:01,486 --> 00:04:03,019
for one-on-one combat.

93
00:04:03,054 --> 00:04:05,821
If you were to prevail,
you would easily be

94
00:04:05,857 --> 00:04:08,991
the greatest leader
in Fillorian history.

95
00:04:09,027 --> 00:04:10,192
- The greatest.
- The greatest.

96
00:04:10,228 --> 00:04:11,694
God,

97
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:14,597
he's already seeing the statues.

98
00:04:14,632 --> 00:04:16,565
I hereby decree...

99
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:20,169
rulers done gonna rumble.

100
00:04:24,976 --> 00:04:31,948

101
00:04:31,983 --> 00:04:34,583
Eliot's the king of all this?

102
00:04:34,619 --> 00:04:38,054
Yeah, looking for rock-solid
proof there's no justice, that.

103
00:04:38,089 --> 00:04:40,990
Even this dungeon's nicer than
any place I lived as a kid--

104
00:04:41,025 --> 00:04:43,125
oh, except for my uncle's BMW.

105
00:04:43,161 --> 00:04:45,561
Would've been even nicer
if he'd actually been my uncle.

106
00:04:47,665 --> 00:04:49,532
Don't be fooled
by the high gloss.

107
00:04:49,567 --> 00:04:51,067
This place sucks.

108
00:04:54,572 --> 00:04:56,973
- Hey.
- What's up?

109
00:04:57,008 --> 00:04:58,908
We found Reynard's son.

110
00:04:58,943 --> 00:05:00,643
So this is a breakout.

111
00:05:00,678 --> 00:05:02,878
- Why are you in here anyway?
- I killed trees.

112
00:05:02,914 --> 00:05:05,715
- Seriously.
- That could talk.

113
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,584
They have talking trees here?

114
00:05:08,619 --> 00:05:09,785
Not anymore.

115
00:05:12,323 --> 00:05:14,090
So what's Reynard's son like?

116
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,025
I guarantee
you won't believe it.

117
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:19,228
Let's go.

118
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,703
What the fuck?

119
00:05:27,739 --> 00:05:30,773
He's marking his territory.

120
00:05:30,808 --> 00:05:33,009
Hey, I refuse to be shamed.

121
00:05:33,044 --> 00:05:35,311
Didn't you hear
what Friar Joseph said?

122
00:05:35,346 --> 00:05:37,313
Not all niffins are the same.

123
00:05:37,348 --> 00:05:39,048
I'm not gonna go
on some killing spree

124
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:41,717
anymore than he would.

125
00:05:41,753 --> 00:05:45,588
Q...
don't you believe me?

126
00:05:45,623 --> 00:05:47,957
I believe you believe you.

127
00:05:47,992 --> 00:05:50,960
Sorry?

128
00:05:50,995 --> 00:05:53,963
I'm not talking to you.

129
00:05:56,601 --> 00:05:58,634
I just want to do
what Joseph does.

130
00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:01,203
Please.
Beautiful, high-level magic.

131
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:04,173
I'm not letting you loose.

132
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,675
It's bad for the world.

133
00:06:08,646 --> 00:06:11,280
I'm not boxing you.

134
00:06:11,315 --> 00:06:15,951
I don't want to know
a world without Alice.

135
00:06:15,987 --> 00:06:19,989
Keep this up,
and you won't have to.

136
00:06:20,024 --> 00:06:22,224
We'll both be dead.

137
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,026
Good plan.

138
00:06:31,035 --> 00:06:32,735
Eliot...

139
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,904
The intel I'm getting
on King Idri

140
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:38,174
and the protocols of dueling--
not good.

141
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:40,676
I mean, you ever even touched
a sword before today?

142
00:06:40,711 --> 00:06:43,946
No, but...Magician.

143
00:06:43,981 --> 00:06:45,347
Well, sword fighting spells,

144
00:06:45,383 --> 00:06:48,617
of which there are only two
anyone knows of,

145
00:06:48,653 --> 00:06:50,619
take months to master.

146
00:06:50,655 --> 00:06:53,722
Why? It's a giant
butter knife.

147
00:06:56,127 --> 00:06:59,628
It's all the variables
in any given match.

148
00:06:59,664 --> 00:07:01,931
It's almost infinite.

149
00:07:01,966 --> 00:07:05,034
I mean, sure, you could
slap together spell,

150
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:08,737
maybe get four
or five good moves.

151
00:07:08,773 --> 00:07:12,842
- Which brings us to thing two.
- How many things are there?

152
00:07:12,877 --> 00:07:17,646
Look, King Idri
has fought 14 duels.

153
00:07:17,682 --> 00:07:19,348
All opponents dead.

154
00:07:23,064 --> 00:07:25,048
Senator Gaines' rise has been
described

155
00:07:25,168 --> 00:07:26,714
<i>as nothing less than meteoric.</i>

156
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:28,628
Reynard's son is John Gaines?

157
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,211
- You know him?
- I mean, I know who he is.

158
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,180
He's on rails
to the White House.

159
00:07:34,249 --> 00:07:36,616
I hit one of his rallies,
did a psychic scan.

160
00:07:36,684 --> 00:07:38,851
Dude believes
every word he says.

161
00:07:45,827 --> 00:07:49,595
<i>I believe that everyone is
born with a flame of goodness,</i>

162
00:07:49,664 --> 00:07:53,966
<i>and if my light or yours go out,</i>

163
00:07:54,035 --> 00:07:57,069
<i>remember, we're not alone
in this world.</i>

164
00:08:01,075 --> 00:08:02,875
- See?
- Wow.

165
00:08:02,944 --> 00:08:06,345
He's the perfect demigod
spokesmodel of absolute evil.

166
00:08:06,414 --> 00:08:09,348
Who's kinda hot as shit.

167
00:08:09,417 --> 00:08:11,384
- What?
- Sorry.

168
00:08:11,452 --> 00:08:13,986
Look, he's not even my type,
obviously; it's--it's weird.

169
00:08:14,055 --> 00:08:15,755
Dude has more magic
coming off him

170
00:08:15,823 --> 00:08:18,624
than every Magician
on Earth combined

171
00:08:18,693 --> 00:08:21,027
and knows not one thing
about magic.

172
00:08:23,331 --> 00:08:25,998
Well, he's sure gonna.

173
00:08:37,045 --> 00:08:39,045
How's the battle prep?

174
00:08:39,113 --> 00:08:41,080
If someone had told me
a year ago

175
00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:43,249
that I'd be venting to my wife,

176
00:08:43,318 --> 00:08:49,655
while preparing to do battle on
behalf of my mythical kingdom...

177
00:08:49,724 --> 00:08:51,757
I'd have done a lot more drugs.

178
00:08:51,826 --> 00:08:53,292
I have something
that might help.

179
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:56,929
Great, depending on
what your definition of help is.

180
00:08:56,998 --> 00:09:01,334
I know I haven't always
given you reason to trust me.

181
00:09:01,402 --> 00:09:04,337
My grandpa forged this sword
for a High King

182
00:09:04,405 --> 00:09:06,072
who vanished without
ever claiming it.

183
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:09,041
Since then, my family's
been saving it

184
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,877
for someone truly worthy.

185
00:09:11,946 --> 00:09:14,714
It's beautiful, but
I'm not sure it actually helps.

186
00:09:14,782 --> 00:09:16,315
I'll never learn
a spell in time.

187
00:09:16,384 --> 00:09:19,985
It was made for a king,
as was the accompanying spell.

188
00:09:23,157 --> 00:09:25,791
And sword spells
take weeks to master.

189
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,860
Not when it's written
for a king.

190
00:09:27,929 --> 00:09:31,063
My grandpa was the royal
family's favorite sword smith

191
00:09:31,132 --> 00:09:33,699
because he knew they were,
uh, too...

192
00:09:33,768 --> 00:09:37,336
- Too lazy to learn?
- Too...preoccupied

193
00:09:37,405 --> 00:09:40,306
with matters of state
for busywork.

194
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:43,376
With this spell and this blade,

195
00:09:43,444 --> 00:09:45,344
you will be a master swordsman.

196
00:09:47,048 --> 00:09:50,116
Insert weak double entendre
I'd have to explain.

197
00:09:50,184 --> 00:09:51,984
Sorry?

198
00:09:52,053 --> 00:09:54,720
"Praise Ember's strength

199
00:09:54,789 --> 00:09:56,188
"and Umber's wisdom.

200
00:09:56,257 --> 00:09:58,457
"Bring unto me
the lifeblood knowledge

201
00:09:58,526 --> 00:10:01,327
of all masters of the blade
who have come before."

202
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,334
Fen...

203
00:10:08,403 --> 00:10:13,239
Fen, I actually feel
marginally less fucked now.

204
00:10:13,307 --> 00:10:17,410
All my life,
I've put my family first.

205
00:10:17,478 --> 00:10:20,980
Now that's you and our baby.

206
00:10:24,786 --> 00:10:26,819
I'll really try
not to die again.

207
00:10:26,888 --> 00:10:29,922
I'd really appreciate that.

208
00:10:40,501 --> 00:10:43,269
No, no, no, stop--
hold on--hey, Becky.

209
00:10:43,337 --> 00:10:45,171
Security?

210
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:47,506
- Security?
- It's not working.

211
00:10:49,377 --> 00:10:50,976
All right.

212
00:10:51,045 --> 00:10:54,547
Whatever this is, stop.
Tell me what you want.

213
00:10:54,615 --> 00:10:58,083
- Man, you're good.
- Mm-hmm.

214
00:10:58,152 --> 00:11:00,286
Let's get to it.

215
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:06,058
Magic is real.

216
00:11:07,395 --> 00:11:09,395
Whoa,
whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, hey.

217
00:11:19,607 --> 00:11:21,407
Okay.

218
00:11:21,476 --> 00:11:24,510
Okay, is this
some kind of a gag?

219
00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:27,112
Is this a publicity stunt
for a TV show?

220
00:11:27,181 --> 00:11:29,215
We're Magicians
being hunted by an evil God,

221
00:11:29,283 --> 00:11:30,583
and so are you.

222
00:11:30,651 --> 00:11:34,019
Listen, obviously
you guys believe this,

223
00:11:34,088 --> 00:11:36,121
- and--and I respect that.
- Bullshit.

224
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,490
No, it is not bullshit.
It is--okay.

225
00:11:37,558 --> 00:11:39,291
This'll take forever.
It's not like

226
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,927
- we need him alive anyway.
- Jesus, what the fuck, Julia?

227
00:11:41,996 --> 00:11:44,396
We don't need him.
We need his energy.

228
00:11:44,465 --> 00:11:46,499
- No.
- You're born, huge energy;

229
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:49,335
you die, bigger energy,
especially a demigod.

230
00:11:49,403 --> 00:11:52,037
That is what we are
after here, people, the energy.

231
00:11:52,106 --> 00:11:54,106
Right now, he's just a skin sack
hiding it from us.

232
00:11:54,175 --> 00:11:58,878
Okay, you need something
to hold that energy.

233
00:11:58,946 --> 00:12:00,513
- Like this?
- Jesus.

234
00:12:00,581 --> 00:12:02,948
- Oh, my God.
- You planned this all along.

235
00:12:03,017 --> 00:12:04,316
All right, all of you,

236
00:12:04,385 --> 00:12:06,051
get the fuck out
of my office now!

237
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,953
I won't die here tonight.

238
00:12:08,022 --> 00:12:11,023
I will not die here!

239
00:12:13,294 --> 00:12:15,160
Oh, shit.

240
00:12:18,866 --> 00:12:20,366
He's okay.

241
00:12:20,434 --> 00:12:22,234
He just fainted.

242
00:12:22,303 --> 00:12:23,836
- Hey!
- Whoa! No.

243
00:12:23,905 --> 00:12:28,073
We are not,<i> not,</i>
killing a U.S. senator.

244
00:12:29,644 --> 00:12:33,648
But we will commit a felony
almost as stupid.

245
00:12:34,252 --> 00:12:35,552
Ok sloth,

246
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:37,514
you're the most honest one
on the damn council,

247
00:12:37,564 --> 00:12:41,122
so I'm counting on you to not
kiss my ass or cover yours.

248
00:12:41,615 --> 00:12:44,115
We've got a sword spell,
so yay us.

249
00:12:44,184 --> 00:12:46,084
But we need
the Wellspring to work.

250
00:12:46,153 --> 00:12:49,721
There can't be one brownout
or blip during the duel.

251
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:53,725
So straight-up,
how do we guarantee that?

252
00:12:56,963 --> 00:12:59,064
- It's too...
- What?

253
00:12:59,132 --> 00:13:02,167
Um...

254
00:13:02,235 --> 00:13:04,469
There is something,

255
00:13:04,538 --> 00:13:06,805
but we urge you not to do it.

256
00:13:06,873 --> 00:13:09,574
- Tell me.
- Petition the fairies?

257
00:13:09,643 --> 00:13:13,044
Fairies?

258
00:13:13,113 --> 00:13:16,581
Do I know about the fairies?

259
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:19,918
They exist outside our realm.

260
00:13:19,986 --> 00:13:23,922
They can be contacted,
and they have great powers.

261
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,723
Well, can they fix
the Wellspring?

262
00:13:25,792 --> 00:13:28,259
Almost certainly.

263
00:13:28,328 --> 00:13:30,128
Guys? The fuck?

264
00:13:30,197 --> 00:13:34,999
Uh, fairies are notoriously...

265
00:13:35,068 --> 00:13:37,569
- mercurial?
- Have ya met your king?

266
00:13:37,637 --> 00:13:41,840
They make complex deals
with steep prices and--

267
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:43,708
Yeah, get me a meeting.

268
00:13:43,777 --> 00:13:46,611
One has to contact
their ambassador,

269
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,615
a human, which can sometimes
take days, even weeks.

270
00:13:50,684 --> 00:13:52,784
Well, then chop-chop.

271
00:13:52,853 --> 00:13:56,087
And never keep information
from me again, okay?

272
00:13:56,156 --> 00:13:57,689
Yes, Your Highness.

273
00:13:57,757 --> 00:14:00,058
You, Sloth, you read me?

274
00:14:07,767 --> 00:14:09,734
- What?
- Nothing.

275
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,973
Is that that senator dude?

276
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:16,641
You think we kidnapped
a U.S. senator

277
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,176
and stuffed him in a closet?

278
00:14:18,245 --> 00:14:20,879
No.
Jesus, of course not.

279
00:14:20,947 --> 00:14:22,247
Okay.

280
00:14:22,315 --> 00:14:24,849
How'd you get him
past the wards?

281
00:14:24,918 --> 00:14:27,785
Hey, does one of you
have an alumni key?

282
00:14:27,854 --> 00:14:30,822
So cool.
Um, can I borrow it sometime?

283
00:14:30,891 --> 00:14:32,811
There's this really hot--
I'd love to sneak her--

284
00:14:32,859 --> 00:14:35,560
Ah, vodka Gibson, four onions.

285
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:38,763
Yeah, right away.

286
00:14:38,832 --> 00:14:39,831
So what do we do
when he wakes up

287
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,266
and starts kicking the door?

288
00:14:41,334 --> 00:14:44,235
Whatever it is has
nothing to do with you.

289
00:14:44,304 --> 00:14:46,604
Stay away from him.

290
00:14:46,673 --> 00:14:47,805
Or?

291
00:14:47,874 --> 00:14:49,741
No, you don't want to go there.

292
00:14:52,646 --> 00:14:54,746
Pretty sure we're already there.

293
00:14:54,814 --> 00:14:56,648
Enough.

294
00:14:58,652 --> 00:15:00,652
I'll keep an eye on the senator.

295
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,687
- She's psychotic.
- Look, she's being

296
00:15:02,756 --> 00:15:05,690
a little...extreme, yeah,

297
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,060
but she's got her reasons, okay?
Just trust me.

298
00:15:09,129 --> 00:15:12,030
- I know Julia.
- That's not Julia.

299
00:15:12,098 --> 00:15:14,732
Even she knows that.

300
00:15:14,801 --> 00:15:16,768
The only person who doesn't seem
to know that is you.

301
00:15:26,746 --> 00:15:29,113
Looks good.

302
00:15:29,182 --> 00:15:31,149
- What's wrong?
- Wrong?

303
00:15:31,218 --> 00:15:36,187
Your face--
I'm an obsessive fan, so tell.

304
00:15:36,256 --> 00:15:38,156
Thank you, Soren.

305
00:15:40,126 --> 00:15:42,193
The sword's good.

306
00:15:42,262 --> 00:15:44,929
The spell makes me great,
but great enough?

307
00:15:44,998 --> 00:15:46,297
If I lose, forget me.

308
00:15:46,366 --> 00:15:48,433
All of you are dead
or imprisoned.

309
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:56,341
Why didn't I see
how huge this is?

310
00:15:56,409 --> 00:15:59,310
I'm...

311
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:01,779
I'm scared...

312
00:16:01,848 --> 00:16:03,781
for all of us.

313
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:06,718
You know what
I'm thinking about?

314
00:16:06,786 --> 00:16:08,152
That video you showed me

315
00:16:08,221 --> 00:16:10,855
of your high school
production of "Les Mis."

316
00:16:12,859 --> 00:16:14,892
You were such a great Valjean.

317
00:16:14,961 --> 00:16:16,294
Ugh.

318
00:16:16,363 --> 00:16:20,031
I was all right at the matinees.

319
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,066
Evenings I'd agree.

320
00:16:22,135 --> 00:16:23,835
- I scaled the heights.
- Mm.

321
00:16:23,903 --> 00:16:26,037
But...

322
00:16:26,106 --> 00:16:27,872
what's your point?

323
00:16:27,941 --> 00:16:31,109
Well, all this reading
we've been doing on war,

324
00:16:31,177 --> 00:16:33,811
I keep coming across
soldiers who'd sing

325
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,880
before going into battle.

326
00:16:35,949 --> 00:16:38,082
To avoid throwing up with fear?

327
00:16:38,151 --> 00:16:40,852
It built confidence, yes,

328
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,421
projected power,
destabilized the enemy.

329
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,690
So give me.

330
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,158
What?

331
00:16:47,227 --> 00:16:48,893
The big number.

332
00:16:51,064 --> 00:16:52,897
I can't.

333
00:16:52,966 --> 00:16:56,768
I'll never remember
all the lyrics.

334
00:16:56,836 --> 00:16:59,203
It's practically
the entire cast.

335
00:16:59,272 --> 00:17:01,005
Which is why...

336
00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:04,876
Magic.

337
00:17:06,346 --> 00:17:08,713
No, I should practice.

338
00:17:08,782 --> 00:17:10,748
So move your ass and sing.

339
00:17:10,817 --> 00:17:13,418
Beyoncé does,
which is why she's a boss.

340
00:17:13,486 --> 00:17:15,820
Mm-mm.
Don't make me sing.

341
00:18:29,429 --> 00:18:32,196
♪ Shall I join
my brothers there?

342
00:18:50,917 --> 00:18:53,117
Sorry,
I had to skip some verses.

343
00:18:53,186 --> 00:18:54,952
They're great,
but they don't really apply

344
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:56,554
to our situation.

345
00:18:56,623 --> 00:18:58,823
Oh, okay.

346
00:18:58,892 --> 00:19:00,224
Gotcha.

347
00:20:17,237 --> 00:20:19,337
I'm confused.

348
00:20:19,405 --> 00:20:22,106
- Is the duel not today?
- It's a metaphor.

349
00:20:22,175 --> 00:20:24,342
- I love that show.
- You know it?

350
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:27,278
Boarding school on Earth.
I played Javert.

351
00:20:27,347 --> 00:20:31,015
Typecasting.

352
00:20:34,521 --> 00:20:35,987
Praise Ember's strength
and Umber's wisdom.

353
00:20:36,055 --> 00:20:37,288
Bring unto me
the lifeblood knowledge

354
00:20:37,357 --> 00:20:38,523
of all masters of the blade.

355
00:20:42,662 --> 00:20:45,229
King Idri...

356
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:50,134
King Eliot...

357
00:20:50,203 --> 00:20:52,069
I'm sorry I have to kill you.

358
00:20:52,138 --> 00:20:53,471
I've died before.

359
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,541
Doesn't seem to take with me.

360
00:20:56,609 --> 00:20:58,109
Shall we?

361
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:13,991
Ah!

362
00:21:27,106 --> 00:21:29,307
Okay, is he allowed to do that?

363
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,442
Kings do whatever.

364
00:21:31,511 --> 00:21:33,511
Fine, he bitched out.
It's over.

365
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,747
It's over when
one ruler is dead.

366
00:21:36,816 --> 00:21:39,083
Another favorite show of mine...

367
00:21:39,152 --> 00:21:41,319
"Into the Woods."

368
00:21:52,674 --> 00:21:55,275
I cannot believe how
fucking boring this is.

369
00:21:58,847 --> 00:22:01,247
You know I can see magic?

370
00:22:03,318 --> 00:22:04,884
Not the kind that
you can do with your hands--

371
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,953
that Stone Age bullshit.

372
00:22:06,989 --> 00:22:09,723
I can see pure magic

373
00:22:09,758 --> 00:22:14,527
in a thousand dimensions
all at once.

374
00:22:14,563 --> 00:22:16,229
You're not Quentin.

375
00:22:16,264 --> 00:22:19,399
Get me out of here.

376
00:22:19,434 --> 00:22:20,600
Alice.

377
00:22:20,635 --> 00:22:22,969
Quentin always said
you were smart.

378
00:22:23,005 --> 00:22:24,738
He said the same about you.

379
00:22:24,773 --> 00:22:26,873
Well, then,
between the two of us,

380
00:22:26,908 --> 00:22:29,576
we should be able
to figure something out.

381
00:22:29,611 --> 00:22:31,978
I'm not sure that's
what Q would want.

382
00:22:32,014 --> 00:22:34,247
What do you want, Julia?

383
00:22:34,282 --> 00:22:37,984
What are you thinking?

384
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:41,721
Oh, I can almost see it...

385
00:22:41,757 --> 00:22:45,592
just like I can see
that your shade is gone,

386
00:22:45,627 --> 00:22:48,595
which is how I know that your...

387
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:52,399
thoughts are pure, unencumbered.

388
00:22:52,434 --> 00:22:54,801
I'm right, aren't I?

389
00:22:54,836 --> 00:22:58,605
We both no life
is not clouded with regret,

390
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,908
need, sadness.

391
00:23:01,943 --> 00:23:06,780
We both know life is
crystalline, clear, cold, sharp.

392
00:23:06,815 --> 00:23:08,948
You--

393
00:23:08,984 --> 00:23:11,618
he's bleeding.

394
00:23:11,653 --> 00:23:13,987
God, he's so weak.

395
00:23:26,935 --> 00:23:30,770
<i>John, I'm here.</i>

396
00:23:30,806 --> 00:23:33,606
<i>I know you have questions.</i>

397
00:23:33,642 --> 00:23:36,609
<i>I have all the answers
you could ever want.</i>

398
00:23:36,645 --> 00:23:38,611
I'm Reynard.

399
00:23:38,647 --> 00:23:41,281
<i>Your place is with me.</i>

400
00:23:47,322 --> 00:23:49,856
Who the fuck is Reynard,
and why is he in my head?

401
00:23:53,728 --> 00:23:56,596
There's nothing we can do.

402
00:23:56,631 --> 00:23:58,298
It's up to him.

403
00:23:58,333 --> 00:23:59,999
- Jesus, he's stubborn.
- What is happening?

404
00:24:00,035 --> 00:24:01,768
What is happening?
Will you get him out of my head?

405
00:24:01,803 --> 00:24:03,636
- Make it stop.
- What now?

406
00:24:03,672 --> 00:24:05,738
This is so much worse
than you think.

407
00:24:05,774 --> 00:24:07,707
- Is that Senator Gaines?
- Probably.

408
00:24:07,742 --> 00:24:09,509
I mean, why not?

409
00:24:09,544 --> 00:24:11,811
Can you do something
to ward his mind from the voice?

410
00:24:11,847 --> 00:24:14,013
- What voice?
- Reynard's.

411
00:24:14,049 --> 00:24:16,049
- He's after his son.
- Where?

412
00:24:16,084 --> 00:24:19,586
Outside the wards, I guess.

413
00:24:19,621 --> 00:24:22,555
Okay, whatever
you're thinking, don't.

414
00:24:22,591 --> 00:24:24,090
I'm not the one
you should worry about.

415
00:24:45,814 --> 00:24:48,581
You are out of your element,
child of Earth.

416
00:24:52,087 --> 00:24:54,521
Well done.

417
00:24:54,556 --> 00:24:56,022
Well done.

418
00:24:59,761 --> 00:25:03,129
Yes.

419
00:25:03,165 --> 00:25:08,101
I'd give you an update,
but I hate seeing boys cry.

420
00:25:08,136 --> 00:25:10,737
He won't be able to get in here,

421
00:25:10,772 --> 00:25:14,874
not after the security protocols
we put in place after The Beast.

422
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:17,577
As long as they hold,
we're safe.

423
00:25:17,612 --> 00:25:20,079
You're probably right.
I hope you're right,

424
00:25:20,115 --> 00:25:22,582
but we are talking about
a not-so-benevolent god...

425
00:25:22,617 --> 00:25:25,919
- Mm.
- After his only child.

426
00:25:25,954 --> 00:25:29,656
Listen, I'm sorry for getting
so hysterical back there.

427
00:25:29,691 --> 00:25:31,391
I'm having a lot
of trouble with this.

428
00:25:31,426 --> 00:25:32,792
It's okay.

429
00:25:32,827 --> 00:25:34,127
How did you get
his voice to stop?

430
00:25:34,162 --> 00:25:36,496
What the hell
is this thing on my neck?

431
00:25:36,531 --> 00:25:38,531
It's a patch.
It blocks psychic interference.

432
00:25:38,567 --> 00:25:40,533
It works, trust me.

433
00:25:40,569 --> 00:25:43,770
I have to be honest.
I hope I'm in a mental ward.

434
00:25:45,907 --> 00:25:48,141
Majesty, you must
return to Whitespire.

435
00:25:48,176 --> 00:25:50,577
- Are you insane?
- He will not wait.

436
00:25:50,612 --> 00:25:53,079
- Who?
- The ambassador to the fairies.

437
00:25:57,652 --> 00:26:01,888
I'm afraid this has to end!

438
00:26:01,923 --> 00:26:04,791
Don't prolong it.

439
00:26:04,826 --> 00:26:06,593
Monarch to monarch,

440
00:26:06,628 --> 00:26:09,696
when I kill you,
I'll be merciful.

441
00:26:09,731 --> 00:26:11,598
That's kind of you.

442
00:26:25,046 --> 00:26:28,047
Oh, shit.

443
00:26:28,083 --> 00:26:30,483
- The Wellspring.
- Shit.

444
00:26:35,156 --> 00:26:37,123
Praise Ember's strength
and Umber's wisdom.

445
00:26:37,158 --> 00:26:39,058
Bring unto me
the lifeblood knowledge

446
00:26:39,094 --> 00:26:41,928
of all--

447
00:26:49,838 --> 00:26:51,104
All right, come on.

448
00:27:02,684 --> 00:27:04,651
Blackout.
The wards are down.

449
00:27:04,686 --> 00:27:07,787
Everyone get to the lab.
Now!

450
00:27:11,693 --> 00:27:13,860
- Let's go.
- Run!

451
00:27:13,895 --> 00:27:15,662
What's happening?

452
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,743
- Move, people! Quickly!
- Inside! Lets go!

453
00:27:27,053 --> 00:27:30,962
Come on, this aint a pop quiz, let's go, you
don't want to be out there, let's go, come on!

454
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:33,682
How long can the emergency generator
in here keep the lab working?

455
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:36,101
Hopefully long enough till
we think of something.

456
00:27:55,546 --> 00:27:58,146
Of course those I represent
would always consider

457
00:27:58,182 --> 00:27:59,667
with the utmost respect

458
00:28:00,019 --> 00:28:02,431
any royal request, Your Majesty.

459
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,157
When can we meet
face-to-face?

460
00:28:06,192 --> 00:28:09,293
When you conclude
the bargain with me.

461
00:28:09,329 --> 00:28:10,828
No.

462
00:28:10,864 --> 00:28:13,798
I wanna know
who I'm sealing the deal with.

463
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:15,900
Not possible, Majesty.

464
00:28:15,935 --> 00:28:20,405
The ways of the fairies are--
well, how should I put it--

465
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:23,274
as implacable
as they are ancient.

466
00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:27,011
In any case, I would imagine
time is of the essence, no?

467
00:28:27,046 --> 00:28:29,480
The fairies can bring back
the Wellspring?

468
00:28:29,516 --> 00:28:30,948
They can.

469
00:28:30,984 --> 00:28:32,817
And in return?

470
00:28:32,852 --> 00:28:34,986
A royal child of Whitespire.

471
00:28:35,021 --> 00:28:38,456
The fairies want a baby?

472
00:28:38,491 --> 00:28:40,792
They aren't gonna eat it,
are they?

473
00:28:40,827 --> 00:28:42,794
It'll be raised as a fairy.

474
00:28:42,829 --> 00:28:45,296
It'll know great knowledge,
and even greater power.

475
00:28:45,331 --> 00:28:50,201
Well...
I'm not loving this,

476
00:28:50,236 --> 00:28:53,304
- but I could get knocked up--
- No.

477
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:56,941
The child that grows in the womb
of the High King's wife.

478
00:28:56,976 --> 00:28:58,943
Are you fucking kidding me?

479
00:29:02,382 --> 00:29:05,283
Highness?
A word?

480
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:10,388
You've offended the ambassador.

481
00:29:10,423 --> 00:29:12,857
He will no longer
bargain with you.

482
00:29:12,892 --> 00:29:15,393
- What?
- Because you question him,

483
00:29:15,428 --> 00:29:18,129
he will only honor
the present deal

484
00:29:18,164 --> 00:29:22,834
without further amendment,
or there will be no deal at all.

485
00:29:29,008 --> 00:29:32,210
I do not have powers.
That is impossible.

486
00:29:32,245 --> 00:29:34,779
It's impossible you don't.

487
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:37,248
- Look at your career.
- Hey, I work hard.

488
00:29:37,283 --> 00:29:39,817
Have you ever failed
at anything ever?

489
00:29:39,853 --> 00:29:42,453
Just be honest.

490
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,522
I've had losses.

491
00:29:44,557 --> 00:29:46,491
- My parents--
- Yeah, died,

492
00:29:46,526 --> 00:29:49,861
and left you, what, $20 million?

493
00:29:49,896 --> 00:29:51,863
So what are you saying exactly?

494
00:29:51,898 --> 00:29:54,098
Are you saying I used
some kind of magic spell

495
00:29:54,133 --> 00:29:56,067
- to kill my parents for money?
- No. No.

496
00:29:56,102 --> 00:30:00,905
Look, what you have,
it is bigger than--

497
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,007
than--than what
any Magician can do.

498
00:30:03,042 --> 00:30:04,809
You know, you used your powers

499
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:07,979
even without knowing it
to create you.

500
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:12,583
And the world was made to
worship and follow you anywhere.

501
00:30:12,619 --> 00:30:15,820
So if my birth father's a god
and I'm a demigod,

502
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,495
why the hell did it take me
a year to pass

503
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:21,559
the most boring farm bill
in the history of the Senate?

504
00:30:21,594 --> 00:30:24,228
But it got passed, right?

505
00:30:24,264 --> 00:30:26,531
Come on, has any bill
you ever sponsored failed?

506
00:30:26,566 --> 00:30:29,867
- Come on.
- Has it?

507
00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:34,505
Holy shit.

508
00:30:55,128 --> 00:30:57,461
Hi.

509
00:30:57,497 --> 00:31:01,566
You can't stay up there forever.

510
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:07,638
Fen, Eliot's going to lose,

511
00:31:07,674 --> 00:31:09,540
if he hasn't already.

512
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:12,510
Without magic,
he's basically unarmed.

513
00:31:12,545 --> 00:31:14,478
And the Wellspring's gone black.

514
00:31:14,514 --> 00:31:17,148
You have to do something.

515
00:31:17,183 --> 00:31:19,317
I think I can,

516
00:31:19,352 --> 00:31:23,921
but I need you to promise me
that if magic is returned,

517
00:31:23,957 --> 00:31:26,557
Eliot lives
and there's no war--

518
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:29,493
that you will do
exactly what I tell you.

519
00:31:29,529 --> 00:31:31,896
- Of course.
- Whatever it is.

520
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:34,332
Yes. Please.
Don't let him die.

521
00:31:41,407 --> 00:31:43,641
You are most skillful.

522
00:31:43,676 --> 00:31:47,511
I'm a manipulative cunt.

523
00:31:47,547 --> 00:31:51,682
Fix the Wellspring,<i> now.</i>

524
00:32:08,735 --> 00:32:10,701
No rush.

525
00:32:10,737 --> 00:32:12,603
I'll win eventually.

526
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:15,272
I wish your magic
hadn't gone out.

527
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,541
I like my fights fair.

528
00:32:17,577 --> 00:32:20,044
You do realize if this
is a legit magic blackout,

529
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:22,480
it fucks both Fillory
and Loria, right?

530
00:32:22,515 --> 00:32:25,082
My people are
so used to scarcity,

531
00:32:25,118 --> 00:32:27,184
I don't even think
it'll register.

532
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:30,388
Sometimes, I think they like
being dissatisfied.

533
00:32:30,423 --> 00:32:33,057
Preach.

534
00:32:33,092 --> 00:32:35,593
If you do kill me,
I guess you'll spare me decades

535
00:32:35,628 --> 00:32:40,097
of trying to fix a kingdom
hell-bent on staying broken,

536
00:32:40,133 --> 00:32:43,401
doomed to sexual frustration.

537
00:32:43,436 --> 00:32:46,137
- But you have a wife.
- Exactly.

538
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:48,005
Oh, and I'm going
to be a father,

539
00:32:48,041 --> 00:32:50,508
if that changes your mind about
the whole killing me thing.

540
00:32:50,543 --> 00:32:54,979
Wish I had a choice,
but one of us has to die,

541
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:57,515
and I'm not the one up a tree.

542
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,684
Worth a shot.

543
00:32:59,719 --> 00:33:02,753
At least you don't have
to worry about getting old.

544
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:04,689
Excuse me.

545
00:33:04,724 --> 00:33:09,193
I would age like a fine wine.

546
00:33:09,228 --> 00:33:13,397
And you are a total DILF.

547
00:33:13,433 --> 00:33:15,299
Should I be offended?

548
00:33:15,334 --> 00:33:19,203
Let's just say
it's too bad I have a wife.

549
00:33:19,238 --> 00:33:22,773
I get it.
My love for my late wife

550
00:33:22,809 --> 00:33:25,509
kept me from selecting
a husband too.

551
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:28,713
Um, wait.

552
00:33:28,748 --> 00:33:30,214
What?

553
00:33:30,249 --> 00:33:33,684
It is a shame
I have to kill you.

554
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,188
I actually find you
very attractive.

555
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:39,390
God damn it.

556
00:33:39,425 --> 00:33:41,392
God damn it!

557
00:33:42,695 --> 00:33:45,696
- Where's Quentin?
- What?

558
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:48,599
Shit.
Julia's not here either.

559
00:33:48,634 --> 00:33:50,267
What?

560
00:33:54,307 --> 00:33:57,308
I don't understand.
You have a new weapon

561
00:33:57,343 --> 00:33:59,643
- to kill Reynard?
- No, you do.

562
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,613
I do what?

563
00:34:02,648 --> 00:34:06,450
You have a nuclear bomb
inside of you.

564
00:34:06,486 --> 00:34:08,352
- Wait, Alice?
- I talked to her.

565
00:34:08,387 --> 00:34:09,653
She's a killing machine
right now.

566
00:34:09,689 --> 00:34:11,622
Tell her you wanna make a deal.

567
00:34:11,657 --> 00:34:14,692
She kills Reynard, she's free.

568
00:34:14,727 --> 00:34:17,194
No.

569
00:34:18,664 --> 00:34:21,632
Do it, or we all die
right here, right now, Q.

570
00:34:27,103 --> 00:34:29,919
It's not like you to
hide behind wards, Julia.

571
00:34:30,374 --> 00:34:33,509
- Come face me.
- Face him first.

572
00:34:33,544 --> 00:34:37,346
Mmm.

573
00:34:37,381 --> 00:34:40,850
Even with that...
thing inside of him,

574
00:34:40,885 --> 00:34:44,253
he's nowhere near
as interesting as you.

575
00:34:46,424 --> 00:34:48,390
But I'll make due.

576
00:34:48,426 --> 00:34:50,326
- Let me out, I'll kill him.
- No.

577
00:34:52,029 --> 00:34:56,298
Julia.

578
00:34:56,334 --> 00:34:57,433
- Get back inside the ward!
- Come on!

579
00:34:57,468 --> 00:34:58,968
- Come on!
- Let me out!

580
00:35:01,005 --> 00:35:02,438
Picked up this little trick

581
00:35:02,473 --> 00:35:04,540
your six-fingered friend
pulled on me.

582
00:35:06,544 --> 00:35:09,812
- You waited too long.
- You know what's funny, Julia?

583
00:35:09,847 --> 00:35:12,815
You work so hard
to hide from me magically,

584
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:16,619
yet you get caught
by a simple security camera

585
00:35:16,654 --> 00:35:19,388
kidnapping a senator.

586
00:35:19,423 --> 00:35:21,357
It's all over the news.

587
00:35:21,392 --> 00:35:24,493
It's grainy, but I'd
recognize you anywhere.

588
00:35:24,529 --> 00:35:26,862
So nice to meet
more of your friends.

589
00:35:26,898 --> 00:35:29,665
I think this is gonna be
a lot of fun.

590
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,267
We have to stop him.

591
00:35:38,409 --> 00:35:40,576
My son.

592
00:35:40,611 --> 00:35:43,712
Whatever you are,

593
00:35:43,748 --> 00:35:46,882
if I am what you say,

594
00:35:46,918 --> 00:35:48,584
don't hurt these people.

595
00:35:48,619 --> 00:35:51,987
Hurt them?
No. Never.

596
00:35:52,023 --> 00:35:55,858
I froze them so they wouldn't
hurt themselves...

597
00:35:55,893 --> 00:35:58,360
or you.

598
00:35:58,396 --> 00:36:01,564
Come.
Come closer.

599
00:36:09,073 --> 00:36:10,472
Damn it!

600
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:35,798
Praise Ember's strength
and Umber's wisdom.

601
00:36:43,107 --> 00:36:45,074
So...

602
00:36:45,109 --> 00:36:47,977
magic's back.

603
00:37:14,705 --> 00:37:16,005
Shit.

604
00:37:19,043 --> 00:37:20,409
What the fuck?

605
00:37:20,444 --> 00:37:22,878
It's called The Clean Room.

606
00:37:22,913 --> 00:37:25,014
No magic.

607
00:37:25,049 --> 00:37:26,915
Did you put
a sleeping spell on me?

608
00:37:26,951 --> 00:37:30,486
Open this door!

609
00:37:30,521 --> 00:37:35,157
I've been trying
to understand you.

610
00:37:35,192 --> 00:37:37,793
At least that's what I thought.
What I've really been doing

611
00:37:37,828 --> 00:37:40,095
is trying to make
excuses for you.

612
00:37:40,131 --> 00:37:42,865
But I can't anymore,

613
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:46,402
not after what you did
to Quentin today.

614
00:37:46,437 --> 00:37:47,770
But he's fine, right?

615
00:37:47,805 --> 00:37:51,073
That's just luck,
and you know it.

616
00:37:51,108 --> 00:37:54,576
You fed him to Reynard.

617
00:37:54,612 --> 00:37:58,113
- He knew how to survive.
- Yeah, by doing what you want.

618
00:37:58,149 --> 00:38:01,850
That's all you see anymore,
is what you want.

619
00:38:01,886 --> 00:38:05,754
You don't feel anymore, Julia,

620
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:08,891
not the way a human does.

621
00:38:08,926 --> 00:38:12,728
It's not your fault.

622
00:38:12,763 --> 00:38:16,198
I hope we can figure
something out,

623
00:38:16,233 --> 00:38:18,967
but until then,

624
00:38:19,003 --> 00:38:20,502
this is it for you.

625
00:38:20,538 --> 00:38:22,237
Kady...

626
00:38:23,808 --> 00:38:26,809
Citizens,
your warrior king returns.

627
00:38:26,844 --> 00:38:30,245
- Praise Ember!
- You scared me, you dick.

628
00:38:32,216 --> 00:38:34,083
Good to see you too, Bambi.

629
00:38:34,118 --> 00:38:37,152
Eliot, are--are you okay?
Are you hurt?

630
00:38:37,188 --> 00:38:40,723
All in one piece, thanks
to that sword spell of yours.

631
00:38:40,758 --> 00:38:45,227
I'm just glad you're safe.
We both are.

632
00:38:45,262 --> 00:38:48,630
I can't believe
you actually won.

633
00:38:48,666 --> 00:38:50,733
Uh, is it really that shocking?

634
00:38:50,768 --> 00:38:53,135
Having seen how you fight
without magic, yes.

635
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:54,803
Hold up.

636
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:57,039
What's King Daddy Fuckface
doing here?

637
00:38:57,074 --> 00:39:00,709
Ah, King Idri
is our honored guest.

638
00:39:00,745 --> 00:39:03,746
What happened to the whole
"one must die" deal?

639
00:39:03,781 --> 00:39:05,013
We're kings.

640
00:39:05,049 --> 00:39:06,515
What's the point
of having great power

641
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,550
if not to right wrongs?

642
00:39:08,586 --> 00:39:11,019
We...

643
00:39:11,055 --> 00:39:14,056
made an agreement.

644
00:39:14,091 --> 00:39:16,959
- We're getting married.
- Wait, what?

645
00:39:16,994 --> 00:39:19,595
Uh, hello?

646
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:22,765
Pregnant wifey?
Your dick no work-y?

647
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,667
Before I flay whoever
neglected to inform me sooner,

648
00:39:25,703 --> 00:39:30,139
apparently all monarchs
on this glorious, magical planet

649
00:39:30,174 --> 00:39:31,707
are entitled to one of each.

650
00:39:31,742 --> 00:39:34,009
A wife, and a husband.

651
00:39:34,044 --> 00:39:35,577
So what?

652
00:39:35,613 --> 00:39:37,212
You're all just gonna
shack up together?

653
00:39:37,248 --> 00:39:40,582
We're all just one big royal
polyamorous family.

654
00:39:40,618 --> 00:39:42,151
Isn't it great?
No one has to die.

655
00:39:42,186 --> 00:39:44,219
Everyone gets what they want.

656
00:39:44,255 --> 00:39:47,122
El, can we take a second?

657
00:39:51,128 --> 00:39:52,895
What?
So you fucked his son.

658
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:54,696
It doesn't have to be weird.

659
00:39:54,732 --> 00:39:57,166
You sure this is a good idea?

660
00:39:57,201 --> 00:39:58,801
I mean, you're really
doubling up

661
00:39:58,836 --> 00:40:01,170
on Fillorian marriage contracts.

662
00:40:01,205 --> 00:40:04,540
Sometimes, you have
to sacrifice for diplomacy.

663
00:40:04,575 --> 00:40:06,742
And just wait until
we're husband and husband,

664
00:40:06,777 --> 00:40:10,979
and what some would call
pillow talk, we call...

665
00:40:11,015 --> 00:40:12,881
Espionage?

666
00:40:12,917 --> 00:40:15,150
Diplomatic leverage.

667
00:40:15,186 --> 00:40:17,019
Your Highness!

668
00:40:17,054 --> 00:40:19,621
Thank Ember
for your safe return.

669
00:40:19,657 --> 00:40:23,058
More good news, the Wellspring
is finally replenishing itself.

670
00:40:23,093 --> 00:40:25,894
Ah, good old Tick.

671
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:28,997
Well, everything's
coming up Eliot.

672
00:40:29,033 --> 00:40:32,835
Congrats, future hubby.
Your half is now shit-free.

673
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:35,337
I'm sorry, his what?

674
00:40:35,372 --> 00:40:38,941
That was the deal.
Marriage, peace,

675
00:40:38,976 --> 00:40:42,244
and a 50/50 Wellspring split.

676
00:40:42,279 --> 00:40:44,746
So how'd we finally fix
the Wellspring?

677
00:40:50,154 --> 00:40:51,920
Well...

678
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,106
I am so sorry.

679
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:19,147
I just can't do this anymore.

680
00:41:34,198 --> 00:41:38,066
Alice...

681
00:41:38,102 --> 00:41:41,670
I hope you meant it.

682
00:41:41,705 --> 00:41:44,706
I hope you just go and do...

683
00:41:44,742 --> 00:41:47,910
beautiful magic.

684
00:41:47,945 --> 00:41:48,945
Alice...

685
00:41:54,051 --> 00:41:56,785
Quentin says go free.

686
00:42:28,852 --> 00:42:34,189
