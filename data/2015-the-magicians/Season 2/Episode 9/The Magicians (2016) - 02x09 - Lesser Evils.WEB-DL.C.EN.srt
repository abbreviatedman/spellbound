00:00:00,967 --> 00:00:03,009
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:03,271 --> 00:00:05,104
- Fuck!
- I'm so sorry.

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:07,173
It's Reynard. He's back.

4
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:08,574
Wait, I am pregnant.

5
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:11,377
I wasn't the only one
he raped that night,

6
00:00:11,655 --> 00:00:14,423
but I was the only one who got pregnant.

7
00:00:14,458 --> 00:00:16,792
This is exorcism, you understand?

8
00:00:16,827 --> 00:00:18,894
Did it work? Is it gone?

9
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:22,564
In the center of your being,
there's a tiny beating heart.

10
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:25,701
It's called a shade.
It's what makes you feel.

11
00:00:25,736 --> 00:00:28,270
The pain will burn you
till there's nothing.

12
00:00:28,305 --> 00:00:31,673
There was a complication.
Her shade, it's gone.

13
00:00:31,709 --> 00:00:33,375
I feel light,

14
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,844
like a million pound weight's
off my chest.

15
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:37,679
Say we get the perfect spell,

16
00:00:37,715 --> 00:00:39,681
think about the energy
it'd take to work it.

17
00:00:39,717 --> 00:00:41,917
Dana's baby... his son.

18
00:00:41,952 --> 00:00:43,719
You know, there is
a ton of lore on demigods.

19
00:00:43,754 --> 00:00:45,387
They're powerful in their own right.

20
00:00:45,422 --> 00:00:46,722
We need to find him.

21
00:00:46,757 --> 00:00:48,390
As for Loria...

22
00:00:48,425 --> 00:00:50,292
Some 8,000 troops
are headed to the border.

23
00:00:50,327 --> 00:00:51,626
So we're totally outnumbered.

24
00:00:51,662 --> 00:00:53,829
And of course,
our preparation is affected

25
00:00:53,864 --> 00:00:56,898
by the continued unsteadiness
of the Wellspring.

26
00:00:56,934 --> 00:00:58,867
- Looks like...
- A major drought's hit.

27
00:01:01,338 --> 00:01:03,905
You can't even get out
of this shoddy little magician.

28
00:01:03,941 --> 00:01:06,541
Free yourself, then find me.

29
00:01:06,577 --> 00:01:08,817
- Alice, we can talk about this.
- Just shut up! Shut up!

30
00:01:08,846 --> 00:01:11,480
This is your body trying
to hold a niffin inside it.

31
00:01:11,515 --> 00:01:14,649
You can't... not for much longer,

32
00:01:14,685 --> 00:01:16,451
or it's gonna kill us both.

33
00:01:22,893 --> 00:01:25,861
Seriously, you guys, I'm in a cage.

34
00:01:25,896 --> 00:01:29,564
You think this is, uh, a tad redundant?

35
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,533
- Protocol.
- For werewolves.

36
00:01:31,568 --> 00:01:33,335
Okay, technically, I have

37
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:36,338
sexually transmitted
lycanthropy... a very mild case.

38
00:01:36,373 --> 00:01:38,540
Would've been cool
to actually fully wolf out.

39
00:01:38,575 --> 00:01:39,841
You know...

40
00:01:39,877 --> 00:01:41,343
Either way, it's totally curable.

41
00:01:41,378 --> 00:01:44,713
Treatable. There is no actual cure.

42
00:01:44,748 --> 00:01:48,049
Well, silver bullet.

43
00:01:48,085 --> 00:01:49,751
Hey, don't go through my bag.

44
00:01:49,787 --> 00:01:52,921
Quentin, you're dying.

45
00:01:52,956 --> 00:01:54,723
Yeah, well, aren't we all?

46
00:01:54,758 --> 00:01:56,424
You are dying quickly.

47
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,494
You cannot keep this thing
inside you much longer.

48
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,862
Well, I can't let her go.

49
00:02:00,898 --> 00:02:02,864
Which is why you must box her.

50
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,599
I'm not doing that to Alice.

51
00:02:04,635 --> 00:02:06,368
Quentin, there is no more Alice.

52
00:02:06,403 --> 00:02:09,538
This is uncharted territory.
Nobody knows.

53
00:02:09,573 --> 00:02:10,939
Well, I know that
you will be dead in days

54
00:02:10,974 --> 00:02:12,841
if you don't rid yourself of her.

55
00:02:12,876 --> 00:02:15,644
May I help you steal from me?

56
00:02:15,679 --> 00:02:17,846
Nope, I got it.

57
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:22,551
Good luck with all your shit.

58
00:02:26,857 --> 00:02:29,624
These damn brownouts.

59
00:02:30,994 --> 00:02:34,796
We may be the least trusted monarchs

60
00:02:34,832 --> 00:02:38,033
in the history of Fillory.

61
00:02:38,068 --> 00:02:40,669
Thank God they don't have polls here.

62
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,643
That's the third brownout this week.

63
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:51,680
If we don't fix the Wellspring
soon, Your Majesty...

64
00:02:51,715 --> 00:02:53,982
One problem at a time, okay?

65
00:02:54,017 --> 00:02:56,585
Our soldiers are
deserting us in protest,

66
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:59,054
thanks to Julia
committing tree genocide.

67
00:02:59,089 --> 00:03:00,822
Pardon me, Your Majesty.

68
00:03:00,858 --> 00:03:02,591
For the official records, may I suggest

69
00:03:02,626 --> 00:03:05,026
a slightly less incendiary term?

70
00:03:05,062 --> 00:03:06,928
Perhaps "arbicide"?

71
00:03:06,964 --> 00:03:08,730
Sure, if you can also recommend

72
00:03:08,765 --> 00:03:10,966
how we fight a war without an army.

73
00:03:15,505 --> 00:03:18,874
Your Majesty, there is one option...

74
00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:22,177
- a rather obscure law, based...
- Less words.

75
00:03:22,212 --> 00:03:24,880
One-on-one combat.

76
00:03:24,915 --> 00:03:27,115
Between monarchs.

77
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,850
- A duel?
- El...

78
00:03:28,886 --> 00:03:30,986
With Ess's dad?
He's gotta be at least 50.

79
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:32,888
And I'm pretty buff from all the living

80
00:03:32,923 --> 00:03:34,990
without technology or decent wine.

81
00:03:35,025 --> 00:03:36,491
Slow down.

82
00:03:36,526 --> 00:03:38,560
Is there any rule about not using magic?

83
00:03:38,595 --> 00:03:41,763
- No, Your Majesty.
- Highness, if I may,

84
00:03:41,798 --> 00:03:43,932
there is a reason
we haven't brought up this, uh,

85
00:03:43,967 --> 00:03:45,533
option before,

86
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:48,803
especially since magic
is not completely dependable.

87
00:03:48,839 --> 00:03:51,573
Simply put, you're likely to...

88
00:03:51,608 --> 00:03:53,541
well... die.

89
00:03:53,577 --> 00:03:56,778
Mm-hmm. Tick, if I did this,

90
00:03:56,813 --> 00:03:58,847
how popular would I be?

91
00:03:58,882 --> 00:04:02,450
No king has ever volunteered

92
00:04:02,486 --> 00:04:04,019
for one-on-one combat.

93
00:04:04,054 --> 00:04:06,821
If you were to prevail,
you would easily be

94
00:04:06,857 --> 00:04:09,991
the greatest leader
in Fillorian history.

95
00:04:10,027 --> 00:04:11,192
- The greatest.
- The greatest.

96
00:04:11,228 --> 00:04:12,694
God,

97
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:15,597
he's already seeing the statues.

98
00:04:15,632 --> 00:04:17,332
I hereby decree...

99
00:04:17,601 --> 00:04:20,668
rulers done gonna rumble.

100

101
00:04:32,883 --> 00:04:35,483
Eliot's the king of all this?

102
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:38,954
Yeah, looking for rock-solid
proof there's no justice, that.

103
00:04:38,989 --> 00:04:41,890
Even this dungeon's nicer than
any place I lived as a kid...

104
00:04:41,925 --> 00:04:44,025
oh, except for my uncle's BMW.

105
00:04:44,061 --> 00:04:46,461
Would've been even nicer
if he'd actually been my uncle.

106
00:04:48,565 --> 00:04:50,432
Don't be fooled by the high gloss.

107
00:04:50,467 --> 00:04:51,967
This place sucks.

108
00:04:55,472 --> 00:04:57,873
- Hey.
- What's up?

109
00:04:57,908 --> 00:04:59,808
We found Reynard's son.

110
00:04:59,843 --> 00:05:01,543
So this is a breakout.

111
00:05:01,578 --> 00:05:03,778
- Why are you in here anyway?
- I killed trees.

112
00:05:03,814 --> 00:05:06,615
- Seriously.
- That could talk.

113
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,484
They have talking trees here?

114
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:10,685
Not anymore.

115
00:05:13,223 --> 00:05:14,990
So what's Reynard's son like?

116
00:05:15,025 --> 00:05:16,925
I guarantee you won't believe it.

117
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,128
Let's go.

118
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,603
What the fuck?

119
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,673
He's marking his territory.

120
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,909
Hey, I refuse to be shamed.

121
00:05:33,944 --> 00:05:36,211
Didn't you hear what Friar Joseph said?

122
00:05:36,246 --> 00:05:38,213
Not all niffins are the same.

123
00:05:38,248 --> 00:05:39,948
I'm not gonna go on some killing spree

124
00:05:39,983 --> 00:05:42,617
anymore than he would.

125
00:05:42,653 --> 00:05:46,488
Q... don't you believe me?

126
00:05:46,523 --> 00:05:48,857
I believe you believe you.

127
00:05:48,892 --> 00:05:51,860
Sorry?

128
00:05:51,895 --> 00:05:54,863
I'm not talking to you.

129
00:05:57,501 --> 00:05:59,534
I just want to do what Joseph does.

130
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:02,103
Please. Beautiful, high-level magic.

131
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:05,073
I'm not letting you loose.

132
00:06:05,108 --> 00:06:07,575
It's bad for the world.

133
00:06:09,546 --> 00:06:12,180
I'm not boxing you.

134
00:06:12,215 --> 00:06:16,851
I don't want to know
a world without Alice.

135
00:06:16,887 --> 00:06:20,889
Keep this up, and you won't have to.

136
00:06:20,924 --> 00:06:23,124
We'll both be dead.

137
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,926
Good plan.

138
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,635
Eliot...

139
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,804
The intel I'm getting on King Idri

140
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,074
and the protocols of dueling...
not good.

141
00:06:39,109 --> 00:06:41,576
I mean, you ever even touched
a sword before today?

142
00:06:41,611 --> 00:06:44,846
No, but... Magician.

143
00:06:44,881 --> 00:06:46,247
Well, sword fighting spells,

144
00:06:46,283 --> 00:06:49,517
of which there are only two
anyone knows of,

145
00:06:49,553 --> 00:06:51,519
take months to master.

146
00:06:51,555 --> 00:06:54,622
Why? It's a giant butter knife.

147
00:06:57,027 --> 00:07:00,528
It's all the variables
in any given match.

148
00:07:00,564 --> 00:07:02,831
It's almost infinite.

149
00:07:02,866 --> 00:07:05,934
I mean, sure, you could
slap together spell,

150
00:07:05,969 --> 00:07:09,637
maybe get four or five good moves.

151
00:07:09,673 --> 00:07:13,742
- Which brings us to thing two.
- How many things are there?

152
00:07:13,777 --> 00:07:18,546
Look, King Idri has fought 14 duels.

153
00:07:18,582 --> 00:07:20,248
All opponents dead.

154
00:07:25,064 --> 00:07:27,048
Senator Gaines' rise has been described

155
00:07:27,168 --> 00:07:28,894
<i>as nothing less than meteoric.</i>

156
00:07:29,153 --> 00:07:31,128
Reynard's son is John Gaines?

157
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,711
- You know him?
- I mean, I know who he is.

158
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,680
He's on rails to the White House.

159
00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:39,116
I hit one of his rallies,
did a psychic scan.

160
00:07:39,184 --> 00:07:41,351
Dude believes every word he says.

161
00:07:48,327 --> 00:07:52,095
<i>I believe that everyone is
born with a flame of goodness,</i>

162
00:07:52,164 --> 00:07:56,106
<i>and if my light or yours go out,</i>

163
00:07:56,535 --> 00:07:59,569
<i>remember, we're not alone in this world.</i>

164
00:08:03,575 --> 00:08:05,375
- See?
- Wow.

165
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:08,845
He's the perfect demigod
spokesmodel of absolute evil.

166
00:08:08,914 --> 00:08:11,848
Who's kinda hot as shit.

167
00:08:11,917 --> 00:08:13,884
- What?
- Sorry.

168
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,486
Look, he's not even my type,
obviously; it's... it's weird.

169
00:08:16,555 --> 00:08:18,255
Dude has more magic coming off him

170
00:08:18,323 --> 00:08:21,124
than every Magician on Earth combined

171
00:08:21,193 --> 00:08:23,527
and knows not one thing about magic.

172
00:08:25,831 --> 00:08:28,498
Well, he's sure gonna.

173
00:08:39,545 --> 00:08:41,545
How's the battle prep?

174
00:08:41,613 --> 00:08:43,580
If someone had told me a year ago

175
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:45,749
that I'd be venting to my wife,

176
00:08:45,818 --> 00:08:52,155
while preparing to do battle on
behalf of my mythical kingdom...

177
00:08:52,224 --> 00:08:54,257
I'd have done a lot more drugs.

178
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:55,792
I have something that might help.

179
00:08:55,861 --> 00:08:59,429
Great, depending on
what your definition of help is.

180
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:03,834
I know I haven't always
given you reason to trust me.

181
00:09:03,902 --> 00:09:06,837
My grandpa forged this sword
for a High King

182
00:09:06,905 --> 00:09:08,572
who vanished without ever claiming it.

183
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,541
Since then, my family's been saving it

184
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:14,377
for someone truly worthy.

185
00:09:14,446 --> 00:09:17,214
It's beautiful, but
I'm not sure it actually helps.

186
00:09:17,282 --> 00:09:18,815
I'll never learn a spell in time.

187
00:09:18,884 --> 00:09:22,485
It was made for a king,
as was the accompanying spell.

188
00:09:25,657 --> 00:09:28,291
And sword spells take weeks to master.

189
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,360
Not when it's written for a king.

190
00:09:30,429 --> 00:09:33,563
My grandpa was the royal
family's favorite sword smith

191
00:09:33,632 --> 00:09:36,199
because he knew they were, uh, too...

192
00:09:36,268 --> 00:09:39,836
- Too lazy to learn?
- Too... preoccupied

193
00:09:39,905 --> 00:09:42,806
with matters of state for busywork.

194
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:45,876
With this spell and this blade,

195
00:09:45,944 --> 00:09:47,844
you will be a master swordsman.

196
00:09:49,548 --> 00:09:52,616
Insert weak double entendre
I'd have to explain.

197
00:09:52,684 --> 00:09:54,484
Sorry?

198
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:57,220
"Praise Ember's strength

199
00:09:57,289 --> 00:09:58,688
"and Umber's wisdom.

200
00:09:58,757 --> 00:10:00,957
"Bring unto me the lifeblood knowledge

201
00:10:01,026 --> 00:10:03,827
of all masters of the blade
who have come before."

202
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,834
Fen...

203
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:15,739
Fen, I actually feel
marginally less fucked now.

204
00:10:15,807 --> 00:10:19,910
All my life, I've put my family first.

205
00:10:19,978 --> 00:10:23,480
Now that's you and our baby.

206
00:10:27,286 --> 00:10:29,319
I'll really try not to die again.

207
00:10:29,388 --> 00:10:32,422
I'd really appreciate that.

208
00:10:43,001 --> 00:10:45,769
No, no, no, stop...
hold on... hey, Becky.

209
00:10:45,837 --> 00:10:47,671
Security?

210
00:10:47,739 --> 00:10:50,006
- Security?
- It's not working.

211
00:10:51,877 --> 00:10:53,476
All right.

212
00:10:53,545 --> 00:10:57,047
Whatever this is, stop.
Tell me what you want.

213
00:10:57,115 --> 00:11:00,583
- Man, you're good.
- Mm-hmm.

214
00:11:00,652 --> 00:11:02,786
Let's get to it.

215
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:08,558
Magic is real.

216
00:11:09,895 --> 00:11:11,895
Whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, hey.

217
00:11:22,107 --> 00:11:23,907
Okay.

218
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:27,010
Okay, is this some kind of a gag?

219
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:29,612
Is this a publicity stunt for a TV show?

220
00:11:29,681 --> 00:11:31,715
We're Magicians
being hunted by an evil God,

221
00:11:31,783 --> 00:11:33,083
and so are you.

222
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:36,519
Listen, obviously you guys believe this,

223
00:11:36,588 --> 00:11:38,621
- and... and I respect that.
- Bullshit.

224
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:39,990
No, it is not bullshit. It is... okay.

225
00:11:40,058 --> 00:11:41,791
This'll take forever. It's not like

226
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,427
- we need him alive anyway.
- Jesus, what the fuck, Julia?

227
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:46,896
We don't need him. We need his energy.

228
00:11:46,965 --> 00:11:48,999
- No.
- You're born, huge energy;

229
00:11:49,067 --> 00:11:51,835
you die, bigger energy,
especially a demigod.

230
00:11:51,903 --> 00:11:54,537
That is what we are
after here, people, the energy.

231
00:11:54,606 --> 00:11:56,606
Right now, he's just a skin sack
hiding it from us.

232
00:11:56,675 --> 00:12:01,378
Okay, you need something
to hold that energy.

233
00:12:01,446 --> 00:12:03,013
- Like this?
- Jesus.

234
00:12:03,081 --> 00:12:05,448
- Oh, my God.
- You planned this all along.

235
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:06,816
All right, all of you,

236
00:12:06,885 --> 00:12:08,551
get the fuck out of my office now!

237
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,453
I won't die here tonight.

238
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:13,523
I will not die here!

239
00:12:15,794 --> 00:12:17,660
Oh, shit.

240
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:22,866
He's okay.

241
00:12:22,934 --> 00:12:24,734
He just fainted.

242
00:12:24,803 --> 00:12:26,336
- Hey!
- Whoa! No.

243
00:12:26,349 --> 00:12:30,517
We are not,<i> not,</i> killing a U.S. senator.

244
00:12:32,144 --> 00:12:36,148
But we will commit a felony
almost as stupid.

245
00:12:37,652 --> 00:12:38,952
Ok sloth,

246
00:12:39,072 --> 00:12:40,914
you're the most honest one
on the damn council,

247
00:12:40,964 --> 00:12:44,522
so I'm counting on you to not
kiss my ass or cover yours.

248
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:47,515
We've got a sword spell, so yay us.

249
00:12:47,584 --> 00:12:49,484
But we need the Wellspring to work.

250
00:12:49,553 --> 00:12:53,121
There can't be one brownout
or blip during the duel.

251
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:57,125
So straight-up,
how do we guarantee that?

252
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,464
- It's too...
- What?

253
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:05,567
Um...

254
00:13:05,635 --> 00:13:07,869
There is something,

255
00:13:07,938 --> 00:13:10,205
but we urge you not to do it.

256
00:13:10,273 --> 00:13:12,974
- Tell me.
- Petition the fairies?

257
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:16,444
Fairies?

258
00:13:16,513 --> 00:13:19,981
Do I know about the fairies?

259
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:23,318
They exist outside our realm.

260
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:27,322
They can be contacted,
and they have great powers.

261
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,123
Well, can they fix the Wellspring?

262
00:13:29,192 --> 00:13:31,659
Almost certainly.

263
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,528
Guys? The fuck?

264
00:13:33,597 --> 00:13:38,399
Uh, fairies are notoriously...

265
00:13:38,468 --> 00:13:40,969
- mercurial?
- Have ya met your king?

266
00:13:41,037 --> 00:13:45,240
They make complex deals
with steep prices and...

267
00:13:45,308 --> 00:13:47,108
Yeah, get me a meeting.

268
00:13:47,177 --> 00:13:50,011
One has to contact their ambassador,

269
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,015
a human, which can sometimes
take days, even weeks.

270
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:56,184
Well, then chop-chop.

271
00:13:56,253 --> 00:13:59,487
And never keep information
from me again, okay?

272
00:13:59,556 --> 00:14:01,089
Yes, Your Highness.

273
00:14:01,157 --> 00:14:03,458
You, Sloth, you read me?

274
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:13,134
- What?
- Nothing.

275
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:18,373
Is that that senator dude?

276
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:20,041
You think we kidnapped a U.S. senator

277
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,576
and stuffed him in a closet?

278
00:14:21,645 --> 00:14:24,279
No. Jesus, of course not.

279
00:14:24,347 --> 00:14:25,647
Okay.

280
00:14:25,715 --> 00:14:28,249
How'd you get him past the wards?

281
00:14:28,318 --> 00:14:31,185
Hey, does one of you have an alumni key?

282
00:14:31,254 --> 00:14:34,222
So cool. Um, can I borrow it sometime?

283
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,211
There's this really hot...
I'd love to sneak her...

284
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:38,960
Ah, vodka Gibson, four onions.

285
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:42,163
Yeah, right away.

286
00:14:42,232 --> 00:14:44,666
So what do we do when he wakes
up and starts kicking the door?

287
00:14:44,734 --> 00:14:47,635
Whatever it is has
nothing to do with you.

288
00:14:47,704 --> 00:14:50,004
Stay away from him.

289
00:14:50,073 --> 00:14:51,205
Or?

290
00:14:51,274 --> 00:14:53,141
No, you don't want to go there.

291
00:14:56,046 --> 00:14:58,146
Pretty sure we're already there.

292
00:14:58,214 --> 00:15:00,048
Enough.

293
00:15:02,052 --> 00:15:04,052
I'll keep an eye on the senator.

294
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,087
- She's psychotic.
- Look, she's being

295
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:09,090
a little... extreme, yeah,

296
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:12,460
but she's got her reasons, okay?
Just trust me.

297
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:15,430
- I know Julia.
- That's not Julia.

298
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:18,132
Even she knows that.

299
00:15:18,201 --> 00:15:20,168
The only person who doesn't seem
to know that is you.

300
00:15:30,146 --> 00:15:32,513
Looks good.

301
00:15:32,582 --> 00:15:34,549
- What's wrong?
- Wrong?

302
00:15:34,618 --> 00:15:39,587
Your face...
I'm an obsessive fan, so tell.

303
00:15:39,656 --> 00:15:41,556
Thank you, Soren.

304
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,593
The sword's good.

305
00:15:45,662 --> 00:15:48,329
The spell makes me great,
but great enough?

306
00:15:48,398 --> 00:15:49,697
If I lose, forget me.

307
00:15:49,766 --> 00:15:51,833
All of you are dead or imprisoned.

308
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:59,741
Why didn't I see how huge this is?

309
00:15:59,809 --> 00:16:02,710
I'm...

310
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:05,179
I'm scared...

311
00:16:05,248 --> 00:16:07,181
for all of us.

312
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:10,118
You know what I'm thinking about?

313
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:11,552
That video you showed me

314
00:16:11,621 --> 00:16:14,255
of your high school
production of "Les Mis."

315
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:18,292
You were such a great Valjean.

316
00:16:18,361 --> 00:16:19,694
Ugh.

317
00:16:19,763 --> 00:16:23,431
I was all right at the matinees.

318
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,466
Evenings I'd agree.

319
00:16:25,535 --> 00:16:27,235
- I scaled the heights.
- Mm.

320
00:16:27,303 --> 00:16:29,437
But...

321
00:16:29,506 --> 00:16:31,272
what's your point?

322
00:16:31,341 --> 00:16:34,509
Well, all this reading
we've been doing on war,

323
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:37,211
I keep coming across soldiers who'd sing

324
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,280
before going into battle.

325
00:16:39,349 --> 00:16:41,482
To avoid throwing up with fear?

326
00:16:41,551 --> 00:16:44,252
It built confidence, yes,

327
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,821
projected power, destabilized the enemy.

328
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:49,090
So give me.

329
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:50,558
What?

330
00:16:50,627 --> 00:16:52,293
The big number.

331
00:16:54,464 --> 00:16:56,297
I can't.

332
00:16:56,366 --> 00:17:00,168
I'll never remember all the lyrics.

333
00:17:00,236 --> 00:17:02,603
It's practically the entire cast.

334
00:17:02,672 --> 00:17:04,405
Which is why...

335
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,276
Magic.

336
00:17:09,746 --> 00:17:12,113
No, I should practice.

337
00:17:12,182 --> 00:17:14,148
So move your ass and sing.

338
00:17:14,217 --> 00:17:16,818
Beyoncé does, which is why she's a boss.

339
00:17:16,886 --> 00:17:19,220
Mm-mm. Don't make me sing.

I'm confused.

395
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:25,506
- Is the duel not today?
- It's a metaphor.

396
00:20:25,575 --> 00:20:27,742
- I love that show.
- You know it?

397
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,678
Boarding school on Earth.
I played Javert.

398
00:20:30,747 --> 00:20:34,415
Typecasting.

399
00:20:37,921 --> 00:20:39,387
Praise Ember's strength
and Umber's wisdom.

400
00:20:39,455 --> 00:20:40,688
Bring unto me the lifeblood knowledge

401
00:20:40,757 --> 00:20:41,923
of all masters of the blade.

402
00:20:46,062 --> 00:20:48,629
King Idri...

403
00:20:50,066 --> 00:20:53,534
King Eliot...

404
00:20:53,603 --> 00:20:55,469
I'm sorry I have to kill you.

405
00:20:55,538 --> 00:20:56,871
I've died before.

406
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,941
Doesn't seem to take with me.

407
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,509
Shall we?

408
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:17,391
Ah!

409
00:21:30,506 --> 00:21:32,707
Okay, is he allowed to do that?

410
00:21:32,775 --> 00:21:34,842
Kings do whatever.

411
00:21:34,911 --> 00:21:36,911
Fine, he bitched out. It's over.

412
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,147
It's over when one ruler is dead.

413
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,483
Another favorite show of mine...

414
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:44,596
"Into the Woods."

415
00:21:57,474 --> 00:22:00,075
I cannot believe how
fucking boring this is.

416
00:22:03,647 --> 00:22:06,047
You know I can see magic?

417
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,821
Not the kind that
you can do with your hands...

418
00:22:09,846 --> 00:22:11,753
that Stone Age bullshit.

419
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:14,523
I can see pure magic

420
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:19,327
in a thousand dimensions all at once.

421
00:22:19,363 --> 00:22:21,029
You're not Quentin.

422
00:22:21,064 --> 00:22:24,199
Get me out of here.

423
00:22:24,234 --> 00:22:25,400
Alice.

424
00:22:25,435 --> 00:22:27,769
Quentin always said you were smart.

425
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:29,538
He said the same about you.

426
00:22:29,573 --> 00:22:31,673
Well, then, between the two of us,

427
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:34,376
we should be able
to figure something out.

428
00:22:34,411 --> 00:22:36,778
I'm not sure that's what Q would want.

429
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:39,047
What do you want, Julia?

430
00:22:39,082 --> 00:22:42,784
What are you thinking?

431
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:46,521
Oh, I can almost see it...

432
00:22:46,557 --> 00:22:50,392
just like I can see
that your shade is gone,

433
00:22:50,427 --> 00:22:53,395
which is how I know that your...

434
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:57,199
thoughts are pure, unencumbered.

435
00:22:57,234 --> 00:22:59,601
I'm right, aren't I?

436
00:22:59,636 --> 00:23:03,405
We both no life
is not clouded with regret,

437
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,708
need, sadness.

438
00:23:06,743 --> 00:23:11,580
We both know life is
crystalline, clear, cold, sharp.

439
00:23:11,615 --> 00:23:13,748
You...

440
00:23:13,784 --> 00:23:16,418
he's bleeding.

441
00:23:16,453 --> 00:23:18,787
God, he's so weak.

442
00:23:31,735 --> 00:23:35,570
<i>John, I'm here.</i>

443
00:23:35,606 --> 00:23:38,406
<i>I know you have questions.</i>

444
00:23:38,442 --> 00:23:41,409
<i>I have all the answers
you could ever want.</i>

445
00:23:41,445 --> 00:23:43,411
I'm Reynard.

446
00:23:43,447 --> 00:23:46,081
<i>Your place is with me.</i>

447
00:23:52,122 --> 00:23:54,656
Who the fuck is Reynard,
and why is he in my head?

448
00:23:58,528 --> 00:24:01,396
There's nothing we can do.

449
00:24:01,431 --> 00:24:03,098
It's up to him.

450
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:04,799
- Jesus, he's stubborn.
- What is happening?

451
00:24:04,835 --> 00:24:06,568
What is happening?
Will you get him out of my head?

452
00:24:06,603 --> 00:24:08,436
- Make it stop.
- What now?

453
00:24:08,472 --> 00:24:10,538
This is so much worse than you think.

454
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,507
- Is that Senator Gaines?
- Probably.

455
00:24:12,542 --> 00:24:14,309
I mean, why not?

456
00:24:14,344 --> 00:24:16,611
Can you do something
to ward his mind from the voice?

457
00:24:16,647 --> 00:24:18,813
- What voice?
- Reynard's.

458
00:24:18,849 --> 00:24:20,849
- He's after his son.
- Where?

459
00:24:20,884 --> 00:24:24,386
Outside the wards, I guess.

460
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:27,355
Okay, whatever you're thinking, don't.

461
00:24:27,391 --> 00:24:28,890
I'm not the one you should worry about.

462
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,381
You are out of your element,
child of Earth.

463
00:24:56,887 --> 00:24:59,321
Well done.

464
00:24:59,356 --> 00:25:00,822
Well done.

465
00:25:04,561 --> 00:25:07,929
Yes.

466
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:12,901
I'd give you an update,
but I hate seeing boys cry.

467
00:25:12,936 --> 00:25:15,537
He won't be able to get in here,

468
00:25:15,572 --> 00:25:19,674
not after the security protocols
we put in place after The Beast.

469
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:22,377
As long as they hold, we're safe.

470
00:25:22,412 --> 00:25:24,879
You're probably right.
I hope you're right,

471
00:25:24,915 --> 00:25:27,382
but we are talking about
a not-so-benevolent god...

472
00:25:27,417 --> 00:25:30,719
- Mm.
- After his only child.

473
00:25:30,754 --> 00:25:34,456
Listen, I'm sorry for getting
so hysterical back there.

474
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,191
I'm having a lot of trouble with this.

475
00:25:36,226 --> 00:25:37,592
It's okay.

476
00:25:37,627 --> 00:25:38,927
How did you get his voice to stop?

477
00:25:38,962 --> 00:25:41,296
What the hell is this thing on my neck?

478
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,331
It's a patch.
It blocks psychic interference.

479
00:25:43,367 --> 00:25:45,333
It works, trust me.

480
00:25:45,369 --> 00:25:48,570
I have to be honest.
I hope I'm in a mental ward.

481
00:25:50,707 --> 00:25:52,941
Majesty, you must return to Whitespire.

482
00:25:52,976 --> 00:25:55,377
- Are you insane?
- He will not wait.

483
00:25:55,412 --> 00:25:57,879
- Who?
- The ambassador to the fairies.

484
00:26:02,452 --> 00:26:06,688
I'm afraid this has to end!

485
00:26:06,723 --> 00:26:09,591
Don't prolong it.

486
00:26:09,626 --> 00:26:11,393
Monarch to monarch,

487
00:26:11,428 --> 00:26:14,496
when I kill you, I'll be merciful.

488
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,398
That's kind of you.

489
00:26:29,846 --> 00:26:32,847
Oh, shit.

490
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:35,283
- The Wellspring.
- Shit.

491
00:26:39,956 --> 00:26:41,923
Praise Ember's strength
and Umber's wisdom.

492
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:43,858
Bring unto me the lifeblood knowledge

493
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:46,728
of all...

494
00:26:54,638 --> 00:26:55,904
All right, come on.

495
00:27:07,484 --> 00:27:09,451
Blackout. The wards are down.

496
00:27:09,486 --> 00:27:12,587
Everyone get to the lab. Now!

497
00:27:16,493 --> 00:27:18,660
- Let's go.
- Run!

498
00:27:18,695 --> 00:27:20,462
What's happening?

499
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:33,343
- Move, people! Quickly!
- Inside! Lets go!

500
00:27:33,653 --> 00:27:35,463
Come on, this aint a pop quiz, let's go,

501
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,546
you don't want to be out there,
let's go, come on!

502
00:27:37,682 --> 00:27:40,282
How long can the emergency generator
in here keep the lab working?

503
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:42,701
Hopefully long enough till
we think of something.

504
00:28:02,146 --> 00:28:04,746
Of course those I represent
would always consider

505
00:28:04,782 --> 00:28:06,267
with the utmost respect

506
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:09,031
any royal request, Your Majesty.

507
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,757
When can we meet face-to-face?

508
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:15,893
When you conclude the bargain with me.

509
00:28:15,929 --> 00:28:17,428
No.

510
00:28:17,464 --> 00:28:20,398
I wanna know
who I'm sealing the deal with.

511
00:28:20,433 --> 00:28:22,500
Not possible, Majesty.

512
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:27,005
The ways of the fairies are...
well, how should I put it...

513
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,874
as implacable as they are ancient.

514
00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:33,611
In any case, I would imagine
time is of the essence, no?

515
00:28:33,646 --> 00:28:36,080
The fairies can bring back
the Wellspring?

516
00:28:36,116 --> 00:28:37,548
They can.

517
00:28:37,584 --> 00:28:39,417
And in return?

518
00:28:39,452 --> 00:28:41,586
A royal child of Whitespire.

519
00:28:41,621 --> 00:28:45,056
The fairies want a baby?

520
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:47,392
They aren't gonna eat it, are they?

521
00:28:47,427 --> 00:28:49,394
It'll be raised as a fairy.

522
00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:51,896
It'll know great knowledge,
and even greater power.

523
00:28:51,931 --> 00:28:56,801
Well... I'm not loving this,

524
00:28:56,836 --> 00:28:59,904
- but I could get knocked up...
- No.

525
00:28:59,939 --> 00:29:03,541
The child that grows in the womb
of the High King's wife.

526
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:05,543
Are you fucking kidding me?

527
00:29:08,982 --> 00:29:11,883
Highness? A word?

528
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,988
You've offended the ambassador.

529
00:29:17,023 --> 00:29:19,457
He will no longer bargain with you.

530
00:29:19,492 --> 00:29:21,993
- What?
- Because you question him,

531
00:29:22,028 --> 00:29:24,729
he will only honor the present deal

532
00:29:24,764 --> 00:29:29,434
without further amendment,
or there will be no deal at all.

533
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:38,810
I do not have powers.
That is impossible.

534
00:29:38,845 --> 00:29:41,379
It's impossible you don't.

535
00:29:41,414 --> 00:29:43,848
- Look at your career.
- Hey, I work hard.

536
00:29:43,883 --> 00:29:46,417
Have you ever failed at anything ever?

537
00:29:46,453 --> 00:29:49,053
Just be honest.

538
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:51,122
I've had losses.

539
00:29:51,157 --> 00:29:53,091
- My parents...
- Yeah, died,

540
00:29:53,126 --> 00:29:56,461
and left you, what, $20 million?

541
00:29:56,496 --> 00:29:58,463
So what are you saying exactly?

542
00:29:58,498 --> 00:30:00,698
Are you saying I used
some kind of magic spell

543
00:30:00,733 --> 00:30:02,667
- to kill my parents for money?
- No. No.

544
00:30:02,702 --> 00:30:07,505
Look, what you have,
it is bigger than...

545
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,607
than... than what any Magician can do.

546
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:11,409
You know, you used your powers

547
00:30:11,444 --> 00:30:14,579
even without knowing it to create you.

548
00:30:14,614 --> 00:30:19,183
And the world was made to
worship and follow you anywhere.

549
00:30:19,219 --> 00:30:22,420
So if my birth father's a god
and I'm a demigod,

550
00:30:22,455 --> 00:30:24,095
why the hell did it take me
a year to pass

551
00:30:24,124 --> 00:30:28,159
the most boring farm bill
in the history of the Senate?

552
00:30:28,194 --> 00:30:30,828
But it got passed, right?

553
00:30:30,864 --> 00:30:33,131
Come on, has any bill
you ever sponsored failed?

554
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:36,467
- Come on.
- Has it?

555
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:41,105
Holy shit.

556
00:31:01,728 --> 00:31:04,061
Hi.

557
00:31:04,097 --> 00:31:08,166
You can't stay up there forever.

558
00:31:11,004 --> 00:31:14,238
Fen, Eliot's going to lose,

559
00:31:14,274 --> 00:31:16,140
if he hasn't already.

560
00:31:16,176 --> 00:31:19,110
Without magic, he's basically unarmed.

561
00:31:19,145 --> 00:31:21,078
And the Wellspring's gone black.

562
00:31:21,114 --> 00:31:23,748
You have to do something.

563
00:31:23,783 --> 00:31:25,917
I think I can,

564
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:30,521
but I need you to promise me
that if magic is returned,

565
00:31:30,557 --> 00:31:33,157
Eliot lives and there's no war...

566
00:31:33,193 --> 00:31:36,093
that you will do
exactly what I tell you.

567
00:31:36,129 --> 00:31:38,496
- Of course.
- Whatever it is.

568
00:31:38,531 --> 00:31:40,932
Yes. Please. Don't let him die.

569
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:50,241
You are most skillful.

570
00:31:50,276 --> 00:31:54,111
I'm a manipulative cunt.

571
00:31:54,147 --> 00:31:58,282
Fix the Wellspring,<i> now.</i>

572
00:32:15,335 --> 00:32:17,301
No rush.

573
00:32:17,337 --> 00:32:19,203
I'll win eventually.

574
00:32:19,239 --> 00:32:21,872
I wish your magic hadn't gone out.

575
00:32:21,908 --> 00:32:24,141
I like my fights fair.

576
00:32:24,177 --> 00:32:26,644
You do realize if this
is a legit magic blackout,

577
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:29,080
it fucks both Fillory and Loria, right?

578
00:32:29,115 --> 00:32:31,682
My people are so used to scarcity,

579
00:32:31,718 --> 00:32:33,784
I don't even think it'll register.

580
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:36,988
Sometimes, I think they like
being dissatisfied.

581
00:32:37,023 --> 00:32:39,657
Preach.

582
00:32:39,692 --> 00:32:42,193
If you do kill me,
I guess you'll spare me decades

583
00:32:42,228 --> 00:32:46,697
of trying to fix a kingdom
hell-bent on staying broken,

584
00:32:46,733 --> 00:32:50,001
doomed to sexual frustration.

585
00:32:50,036 --> 00:32:52,737
- But you have a wife.
- Exactly.

586
00:32:52,772 --> 00:32:54,605
Oh, and I'm going to be a father,

587
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:57,108
if that changes your mind about
the whole killing me thing.

588
00:32:57,143 --> 00:33:01,579
Wish I had a choice,
but one of us has to die,

589
00:33:01,614 --> 00:33:04,115
and I'm not the one up a tree.

590
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:06,284
Worth a shot.

591
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:09,353
At least you don't have
to worry about getting old.

592
00:33:09,389 --> 00:33:11,289
Excuse me.

593
00:33:11,324 --> 00:33:15,793
I would age like a fine wine.

594
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:19,997
And you are a total DILF.

595
00:33:20,033 --> 00:33:21,899
Should I be offended?

596
00:33:21,934 --> 00:33:25,803
Let's just say
it's too bad I have a wife.

597
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:29,373
I get it. My love for my late wife

598
00:33:29,409 --> 00:33:32,109
kept me from selecting a husband too.

599
00:33:32,145 --> 00:33:35,313
Um, wait.

600
00:33:35,348 --> 00:33:36,814
What?

601
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:40,284
It is a shame I have to kill you.

602
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,788
I actually find you very attractive.

603
00:33:43,823 --> 00:33:45,990
God damn it.

604
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:47,992
God damn it!

605
00:33:49,295 --> 00:33:52,296
- Where's Quentin?
- What?

606
00:33:52,332 --> 00:33:55,199
Shit. Julia's not here either.

607
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:56,867
What?

608
00:34:00,907 --> 00:34:03,908
I don't understand.
You have a new weapon

609
00:34:03,943 --> 00:34:06,243
- to kill Reynard?
- No, you do.

610
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:09,213
I do what?

611
00:34:09,248 --> 00:34:13,050
You have a nuclear bomb inside of you.

612
00:34:13,086 --> 00:34:14,952
- Wait, Alice?
- I talked to her.

613
00:34:14,987 --> 00:34:16,253
She's a killing machine right now.

614
00:34:16,289 --> 00:34:18,222
Tell her you wanna make a deal.

615
00:34:18,257 --> 00:34:21,292
She kills Reynard, she's free.

616
00:34:21,327 --> 00:34:23,794
No.

617
00:34:25,264 --> 00:34:28,232
Do it, or we all die
right here, right now, Q.

618
00:34:35,058 --> 00:34:37,874
It's not like you to
hide behind wards, Julia.

619
00:34:38,274 --> 00:34:41,409
- Come face me.
- Face him first.

620
00:34:41,444 --> 00:34:45,246
Mmm.

621
00:34:45,281 --> 00:34:48,750
Even with that... thing inside of him,

622
00:34:48,785 --> 00:34:52,153
he's nowhere near as interesting as you.

623
00:34:54,324 --> 00:34:56,290
But I'll make due.

624
00:34:56,326 --> 00:34:58,226
- Let me out, I'll kill him.
- No.

625
00:34:59,929 --> 00:35:04,198
Julia.

626
00:35:04,234 --> 00:35:05,333
- Get back inside the ward!
- Come on!

627
00:35:05,368 --> 00:35:06,868
- Come on!
- Let me out!

628
00:35:08,905 --> 00:35:10,338
Picked up this little trick

629
00:35:10,373 --> 00:35:12,440
your six-fingered friend pulled on me.

630
00:35:14,444 --> 00:35:17,712
- You waited too long.
- You know what's funny, Julia?

631
00:35:17,747 --> 00:35:20,715
You work so hard
to hide from me magically,

632
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:24,519
yet you get caught
by a simple security camera

633
00:35:24,554 --> 00:35:27,288
kidnapping a senator.

634
00:35:27,323 --> 00:35:29,257
It's all over the news.

635
00:35:29,292 --> 00:35:32,393
It's grainy, but I'd
recognize you anywhere.

636
00:35:32,429 --> 00:35:34,762
So nice to meet more of your friends.

637
00:35:34,798 --> 00:35:37,565
I think this is gonna be a lot of fun.

638
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,167
We have to stop him.

639
00:35:46,309 --> 00:35:48,476
My son.

640
00:35:48,511 --> 00:35:51,612
Whatever you are,

641
00:35:51,648 --> 00:35:54,782
if I am what you say,

642
00:35:54,818 --> 00:35:56,484
don't hurt these people.

643
00:35:56,519 --> 00:35:59,887
Hurt them? No. Never.

644
00:35:59,923 --> 00:36:03,758
I froze them so they wouldn't
hurt themselves...

645
00:36:03,793 --> 00:36:06,260
or you.

646
00:36:06,296 --> 00:36:09,464
Come. Come closer.

647
00:36:16,973 --> 00:36:18,372
Damn it!

648
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:43,698
Praise Ember's strength
and Umber's wisdom.

649
00:36:51,007 --> 00:36:52,974
So...

650
00:36:53,009 --> 00:36:55,877
magic's back.

651
00:37:22,605 --> 00:37:23,905
Shit.

652
00:37:26,943 --> 00:37:28,309
What the fuck?

653
00:37:28,344 --> 00:37:30,778
It's called The Clean Room.

654
00:37:30,813 --> 00:37:32,914
No magic.

655
00:37:32,949 --> 00:37:34,815
Did you put a sleeping spell on me?

656
00:37:34,851 --> 00:37:38,386
Open this door!

657
00:37:38,421 --> 00:37:43,057
I've been trying to understand you.

658
00:37:43,092 --> 00:37:45,693
At least that's what I thought.
What I've really been doing

659
00:37:45,728 --> 00:37:47,995
is trying to make excuses for you.

660
00:37:48,031 --> 00:37:50,765
But I can't anymore,

661
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,302
not after what you did to Quentin today.

662
00:37:54,337 --> 00:37:55,670
But he's fine, right?

663
00:37:55,705 --> 00:37:58,973
That's just luck, and you know it.

664
00:37:59,008 --> 00:38:02,476
You fed him to Reynard.

665
00:38:02,512 --> 00:38:06,013
- He knew how to survive.
- Yeah, by doing what you want.

666
00:38:06,049 --> 00:38:09,750
That's all you see anymore,
is what you want.

667
00:38:09,786 --> 00:38:13,654
You don't feel anymore, Julia,

668
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:16,791
not the way a human does.

669
00:38:16,826 --> 00:38:20,628
It's not your fault.

670
00:38:20,663 --> 00:38:24,098
I hope we can figure something out,

671
00:38:24,133 --> 00:38:26,867
but until then,

672
00:38:26,903 --> 00:38:28,402
this is it for you.

673
00:38:28,438 --> 00:38:30,137
Kady...

674
00:38:31,708 --> 00:38:34,709
Citizens, your warrior king returns.

675
00:38:34,744 --> 00:38:38,145
- Praise Ember!
- You scared me, you dick.

676
00:38:40,116 --> 00:38:41,983
Good to see you too, Bambi.

677
00:38:42,018 --> 00:38:45,052
Eliot, are... are you okay?
Are you hurt?

678
00:38:45,088 --> 00:38:48,623
All in one piece, thanks
to that sword spell of yours.

679
00:38:48,658 --> 00:38:53,127
I'm just glad you're safe. We both are.

680
00:38:53,162 --> 00:38:56,530
I can't believe you actually won.

681
00:38:56,566 --> 00:38:58,633
Uh, is it really that shocking?

682
00:38:58,668 --> 00:39:01,035
Having seen how you fight
without magic, yes.

683
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,703
Hold up.

684
00:39:02,739 --> 00:39:04,939
What's King Daddy Fuckface doing here?

685
00:39:04,974 --> 00:39:08,609
Ah, King Idri is our honored guest.

686
00:39:08,645 --> 00:39:11,646
What happened to the whole
"one must die" deal?

687
00:39:11,681 --> 00:39:12,913
We're kings.

688
00:39:12,949 --> 00:39:14,415
What's the point of having great power

689
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:16,450
if not to right wrongs?

690
00:39:16,486 --> 00:39:18,919
We...

691
00:39:18,955 --> 00:39:21,956
made an agreement.

692
00:39:21,991 --> 00:39:24,859
- We're getting married.
- Wait, what?

693
00:39:24,894 --> 00:39:27,495
Uh, hello?

694
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:30,665
Pregnant wifey? Your dick no work-y?

695
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,567
Before I flay whoever
neglected to inform me sooner,

696
00:39:33,603 --> 00:39:38,039
apparently all monarchs
on this glorious, magical planet

697
00:39:38,074 --> 00:39:39,607
are entitled to one of each.

698
00:39:39,642 --> 00:39:41,909
A wife, and a husband.

699
00:39:41,944 --> 00:39:43,477
So what?

700
00:39:43,513 --> 00:39:45,112
You're all just gonna shack up together?

701
00:39:45,148 --> 00:39:48,482
We're all just one big royal
polyamorous family.

702
00:39:48,518 --> 00:39:50,051
Isn't it great? No one has to die.

703
00:39:50,086 --> 00:39:52,119
Everyone gets what they want.

704
00:39:52,155 --> 00:39:55,022
El, can we take a second?

705
00:39:59,028 --> 00:40:00,795
What? So you fucked his son.

706
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,596
It doesn't have to be weird.

707
00:40:02,632 --> 00:40:05,066
You sure this is a good idea?

708
00:40:05,101 --> 00:40:06,701
I mean, you're really doubling up

709
00:40:06,736 --> 00:40:09,070
on Fillorian marriage contracts.

710
00:40:09,105 --> 00:40:12,440
Sometimes, you have
to sacrifice for diplomacy.

711
00:40:12,475 --> 00:40:14,642
And just wait until
we're husband and husband,

712
00:40:14,677 --> 00:40:18,879
and what some would call
pillow talk, we call...

713
00:40:18,915 --> 00:40:20,781
Espionage?

714
00:40:20,817 --> 00:40:23,050
Diplomatic leverage.

715
00:40:23,086 --> 00:40:24,919
Your Highness!

716
00:40:24,954 --> 00:40:27,521
Thank Ember for your safe return.

717
00:40:27,557 --> 00:40:30,958
More good news, the Wellspring
is finally replenishing itself.

718
00:40:30,993 --> 00:40:33,794
Ah, good old Tick.

719
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:36,497
Well, everything's coming up Eliot.

720
00:40:36,933 --> 00:40:40,427
Congrats, future hubby.
Your half is now shit-free.

721
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,237
I'm sorry, his what?

722
00:40:43,272 --> 00:40:46,622
That was the deal. Marriage, peace,

723
00:40:46,876 --> 00:40:49,122
and a 50/50 Wellspring split.

724
00:40:50,179 --> 00:40:52,646
So how'd we finally fix the Wellspring?

725
00:40:58,054 --> 00:40:59,820
Well...

726
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,006
I am so sorry.

727
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:27,047
I just can't do this anymore.

728
00:41:42,098 --> 00:41:43,661
Alice...

729
00:41:46,002 --> 00:41:48,257
I hope you meant it.

730
00:41:49,605 --> 00:41:52,038
I hope you just go and do...

731
00:41:52,642 --> 00:41:54,476
beautiful magic.

732
00:41:55,845 --> 00:41:56,845
Alice...

733
00:42:01,951 --> 00:42:04,685
Quentin says go free.

734
00:42:37,328 --> 00:42:42,665
