00:00:00,251 --> 00:00:02,293
<i>Hello, glorious audience.</i>

2
00:00:02,293 --> 00:00:04,787
<i>It is I, Ember, god of Fillory.</i>

3
00:00:04,822 --> 00:00:07,222
<i>Feel free to bow and grovel. I'll wait.</i>

4
00:00:07,258 --> 00:00:09,325
<i>Oh, but I've got so much to tell you.</i>

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,528
<i>I, with minor help from my
brother Umber... R.I.P....</i>

6
00:00:12,563 --> 00:00:15,964
<i>created a world intricate as filigree,</i>

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,334
<i>and that is what I called it,</i>

8
00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:21,437
<i>except I was a bit drunk, so... Fillory.</i>

9
00:00:21,472 --> 00:00:23,272
<i>Chock stuffed with magic,</i>

10
00:00:23,307 --> 00:00:24,406
<i>chatty animals,</i>

11
00:00:24,442 --> 00:00:25,441
<i>sexy creatures.</i>

12
00:00:25,476 --> 00:00:27,543
<i>Really, what a planet.</i>

13
00:00:27,578 --> 00:00:30,779
<i>I calibrated everything
for maximum entertainment.</i>

14
00:00:30,815 --> 00:00:34,016
<i>I decreed it be ruled
by children of Earth,</i>

15
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:36,719
<i>a glum little planet known
for its plucky magicians.</i>

16
00:00:36,754 --> 00:00:38,687
<i>These brave souls would come,</i>

17
00:00:38,723 --> 00:00:40,589
<i>and when they got boring, off they went.</i>

18
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:42,858
<i>Case in point, Martin Chatwin.</i>

19
00:00:42,893 --> 00:00:45,494
<i>Brave, clever boy, born hero,</i>

20
00:00:45,529 --> 00:00:48,364
<i>yet honestly,
very uncomfortable to watch</i>

21
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,698
<i>once he'd been molested.</i>

22
00:00:49,734 --> 00:00:51,700
<i>So, I made the difficult decision</i>

23
00:00:51,736 --> 00:00:53,035
<i>to kick him out and replace him</i>

24
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,404
<i>with someone more punchy and fun,</i>

25
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:58,741
<i>but Martin was more tenacious
than I gave him credit for.</i>

26
00:00:58,776 --> 00:01:00,876
<i>He drank from the
Wellspring to get strong,</i>

27
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:02,978
<i>screwing Fillory in the process,</i>

28
00:01:03,013 --> 00:01:05,280
<i>and set booby traps
for my brother and me,</i>

29
00:01:05,316 --> 00:01:06,815
<i>and before you know it, Umber's dead</i>

30
00:01:06,851 --> 00:01:10,352
<i>and I'm hiding in stupid Loria.</i>

31
00:01:10,388 --> 00:01:12,988
I'm so fu... ing bored,
children of Earth.

32
00:01:13,023 --> 00:01:14,656
<i>Cut to... Martin's mutated</i>

33
00:01:14,692 --> 00:01:16,825
<i>into a terrible beast in a dapper suit.</i>

34
00:01:16,861 --> 00:01:19,661
<i>Enter Quentin Coldwater
and his friends...</i>

35
00:01:19,697 --> 00:01:21,397
<i>the Addict, the Victim,</i>

36
00:01:21,432 --> 00:01:23,298
<i>the Bitch, the Scowl,</i>

37
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:24,666
<i>and the Martyr.</i>

38
00:01:24,702 --> 00:01:26,034
<i>I bestowed my blessing,</i>

39
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,303
<i>and they set out to kill The Beast.</i>

40
00:01:28,339 --> 00:01:29,571
<i>Of course, they failed.</i>

41
00:01:29,607 --> 00:01:31,707
<i>Twist! They had to start from scratch</i>

42
00:01:31,742 --> 00:01:33,609
<i>with The Beast. Thrilling.</i>

43
00:01:33,644 --> 00:01:37,079
<i>The danger of sublimated trauma
is a major theme in our story,</i>

44
00:01:37,114 --> 00:01:39,548
<i>evidenced by Julia and Martin teaming up</i>

45
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:41,917
<i>to kill the Earth god who violated her.</i>

46
00:01:41,952 --> 00:01:45,554
<i>All very ambiguous and poignant...
I know!</i>

47
00:01:45,589 --> 00:01:47,990
<i>Julia's partnership also
threw a massive wrench</i>

48
00:01:48,025 --> 00:01:50,559
<i>into Quentin's works. Gut-wrenching!</i>

49
00:01:50,594 --> 00:01:52,995
<i>I was forced to intervene. Cameo!</i>

50
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,898
I have the befouled the Wellspring.

51
00:01:55,933 --> 00:01:58,767
<i>Wasn't it tragic when Alice died?</i>

52
00:01:58,803 --> 00:02:00,803
<i>Wasn't it scary when
she became a niffin?</i>

53
00:02:00,838 --> 00:02:02,704
<i>The personal nature of her story</i>

54
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,541
<i>subverted Quentin's
hero's journey nicely.</i>

55
00:02:05,576 --> 00:02:07,676
<i>Character is destiny and, ultimately,</i>

56
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,579
<i>Quentin is a Magician of
intellect who nevertheless,</i>

57
00:02:10,614 --> 00:02:13,315
<i>and to his detriment,
acts from his heart.</i>

58
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,750
<i>But I did other things too!</i>

59
00:02:14,785 --> 00:02:16,852
<i>Like lead Quentin to that Candy Witch.</i>

60
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,487
<i>Don't worry, that'll pay off.</i>

61
00:02:18,522 --> 00:02:20,722
<i>I hid the Wellspring
ball in plain sight,</i>

62
00:02:20,758 --> 00:02:22,724
<i>made the Rainbow Bridge bloom,</i>

63
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,560
<i>stole from the River Watcher</i>

64
00:02:24,595 --> 00:02:26,562
<i>so he'd be good and angry
when Penny stiffed him.</i>

65
00:02:26,597 --> 00:02:28,397
<i>Oh, I know, good one.</i>

66
00:02:28,432 --> 00:02:29,998
<i>It was I who caused
the High King's bride</i>

67
00:02:30,034 --> 00:02:33,068
<i>to ovulate on the right day,
leading to...</i>

68
00:02:33,103 --> 00:02:34,102
Preg-nant!

69
00:02:34,138 --> 00:02:36,038
<i>Ultimately leading to...</i>

70
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:38,073
<i>The fairies can
bring back the Wellspring?</i>

71
00:02:38,108 --> 00:02:39,708
- They can.
<i>- And in return?</i>

72
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,109
<i>A royal child of Whitespire.</i>

73
00:02:41,145 --> 00:02:42,347
<i>Take her to the dungeon.</i>

74
00:02:42,347 --> 00:02:44,613
He will transport you
to the fairy realm.

75
00:02:44,648 --> 00:02:46,548
<i>I repeatedly broke the filtration system</i>

76
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:49,151
<i>so the Wellspring would
be unpredictable and fun.</i>

77
00:02:49,186 --> 00:02:52,521
<i>All those pesky "brownouts"?</i> Moi!

78
00:02:52,556 --> 00:02:54,756
<i>To be sure, the Order is on to me.</i>

79
00:02:54,792 --> 00:02:56,992
<i>They're in a panic about
the Great Blank Spot,</i>

80
00:02:57,027 --> 00:02:59,628
<i>surmising a fatal hit to the Wellspring.</i>

81
00:02:59,663 --> 00:03:02,431
<i>True, I am nearly finished with Fillory.</i>

82
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:03,866
<i>Every chapter must end,</i>

83
00:03:03,901 --> 00:03:06,535
<i>and on the eve of my
benevolent destruction</i>

84
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:07,936
<i>I'm getting it all out of my system.</i>

85
00:03:07,972 --> 00:03:10,005
<i>Like causing sudden climate change</i>

86
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,774
<i>that kills entire tedious
species of wildlife,</i>

87
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,710
<i>turning people into delicious rats.</i>

88
00:03:14,745 --> 00:03:16,712
<i>All the babies this week
woke up with no mouths.</i>

89
00:03:16,747 --> 00:03:18,277
<i>Oh, horrifying!</i>

90
00:03:18,482 --> 00:03:19,948
<i>I bet you're wondering
what happens next,</i>

91
00:03:19,984 --> 00:03:22,084
<i>and that is how I know
I've done my job well.</i>

92
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:24,853
<i>Sit back, have a nice pipe of marijuana,</i>

93
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:26,555
<i>and enjoy my grand opus.</i>

94
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,725
<i>I call it Fillory's Last Gasp.</i>

95
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,734
I just miss the fire, okay?

96
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:17,039
Drink this.

97
00:04:20,572 --> 00:04:21,503
What is it?

98
00:04:21,503 --> 00:04:24,146
Renders you unable to
harm your own body.

99
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:31,653
This is all pointless, Q.

100
00:04:33,257 --> 00:04:34,923
You can't medicate me away.

101
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:37,492
Just fu... drink it.

102
00:04:43,968 --> 00:04:46,201
All of it.

103
00:04:52,855 --> 00:04:53,742
Ugh.

104
00:04:59,183 --> 00:05:00,749
Why did you bring me back?

105
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,154
Why do you keep asking me that?

106
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,218
I...

107
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,993
I watched you almost die trying
to bring your brother back.

108
00:05:11,028 --> 00:05:13,095
You loved him. I love you.

109
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,203
I'd like to be alone now.

110
00:05:37,821 --> 00:05:39,254
I take that to mean I'm improving.

111
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:40,622
Well, your skin's healing.

112
00:05:40,658 --> 00:05:42,658
Obviously, your lungs are,

113
00:05:42,693 --> 00:05:45,727
to use a technical term, fu... ed,

114
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:47,029
but more importantly...

115
00:05:47,064 --> 00:05:48,964
Just say it.

116
00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:50,198
You have lesions on your spine,

117
00:05:50,234 --> 00:05:52,634
and they're growing aggressively.

118
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,635
Cancer.

119
00:05:53,671 --> 00:05:55,303
Call it cancer plus.

120
00:05:55,339 --> 00:05:59,608
Whatever you were exposed to
has spell residue all over it.

121
00:05:59,643 --> 00:06:00,942
So a magician did this?

122
00:06:00,978 --> 00:06:05,947
Well, if so,
it may be a code we can crack.

123
00:06:05,983 --> 00:06:07,149
How long?

124
00:06:07,184 --> 00:06:10,018
Well, it's hard to say, but I have
my entire department working on it...

125
00:06:10,054 --> 00:06:12,587
I mean how long till I
die if you don't crack it?

126
00:06:13,614 --> 00:06:14,690
Two or three weeks.

127
00:06:14,725 --> 00:06:17,292
But I promise you,
we are doing everything we can to...

128
00:06:17,327 --> 00:06:18,860
- Yeah.
- Okay...

129
00:06:18,896 --> 00:06:20,729
I'm not waiting to
die in a hospital bed.

130
00:06:20,764 --> 00:06:22,731
- Okay, I don't think...
- I'm not!

131
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:27,102
- Can we talk please?
- Yes.

132
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,282
Hey, there, hot stuff.

133
00:06:42,953 --> 00:06:45,821
No offense...
you might look as bad as I do.

134
00:06:45,856 --> 00:06:48,757
I doubt that.

135
00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:51,326
You're dying.

136
00:06:51,361 --> 00:06:54,629
All I am is a little strung out.

137
00:06:54,665 --> 00:06:56,064
Kady...

138
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,833
What? It's not about me.

139
00:06:57,868 --> 00:06:59,234
What happened?

140
00:06:59,269 --> 00:07:01,203
Tell me.

141
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,207
Reynard's gone.

142
00:07:07,111 --> 00:07:09,811
I should be happy, but...

143
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:13,215
it wasn't how I wanted it.

144
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,118
It's not enough.

145
00:07:16,153 --> 00:07:18,720
God, I feel like bashing
my head into a wall.

146
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,162
Why can't anything just be fixed?

147
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:29,164
Life, I guess.

148
00:07:39,676 --> 00:07:41,520
I don't want you to die.

149
00:07:43,347 --> 00:07:44,746
Of course not.

150
00:07:44,782 --> 00:07:46,214
I'm the best lay of your life.

151
00:07:46,704 --> 00:07:48,016
Shut up.

152
00:07:50,754 --> 00:07:51,720
What are we gonna do?

153
00:07:51,755 --> 00:07:53,855
Wrap our minds around it.

154
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:57,092
Kady, let's not waste time
being mad, okay?

155
00:07:57,127 --> 00:07:58,727
I'm just gonna find Quentin and Eliot,

156
00:07:58,762 --> 00:08:01,897
just gonna make a
couple pit stops first.

157
00:08:21,819 --> 00:08:25,750
That's, um... a nice sconce.

158
00:08:25,785 --> 00:08:27,222
- Did you, um...
- Spit it out.

159
00:08:28,992 --> 00:08:31,293
You want something.

160
00:08:31,328 --> 00:08:32,761
Yeah.

161
00:08:32,796 --> 00:08:34,429
First...

162
00:08:38,004 --> 00:08:39,267
Are you okay?

163
00:08:40,871 --> 00:08:43,338
I'm whole again.

164
00:08:43,373 --> 00:08:45,240
W...

165
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,741
Which is a... a good thing.

166
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:49,077
If by good you mean crying jags

167
00:08:49,112 --> 00:08:51,446
and mountains of guilt
and panic attacks,

168
00:08:51,481 --> 00:08:53,715
then, yeah, I'm doing fu... great.

169
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,817
And since I better be getting
back to one of them soon,

170
00:08:55,853 --> 00:08:57,886
whether I like it or not,
how can I help you?

171
00:08:57,921 --> 00:09:01,256
Q says you have an amulet
that would make me invisible to a god.

172
00:09:24,815 --> 00:09:29,417
Um, I don't pretend to understand
what you've been through,

173
00:09:29,996 --> 00:09:31,219
but I can tell you

174
00:09:31,255 --> 00:09:34,723
the way you're relating to that couch
is not unknown to me.

175
00:09:34,758 --> 00:09:36,992
Then you know I want to be alone.

176
00:09:37,027 --> 00:09:43,798
And, um, also that you probably
shouldn't be right now.

177
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:44,933
Why do you care?

178
00:09:44,968 --> 00:09:47,369
I... just do.

179
00:09:49,907 --> 00:09:51,806
Come with me...

180
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:55,110
and help me try to convince
Ember to let us keep Fillory.

181
00:09:55,145 --> 00:09:57,379
- Why?
- Because I have never met

182
00:09:57,414 --> 00:10:00,115
anyone less willing to
take no for an answer.

183
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,750
But I betrayed you, remember?

184
00:10:05,155 --> 00:10:08,456
That was a long time ago.

185
00:10:09,587 --> 00:10:13,194
I need help, and you do too.

186
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,497
Let's kill a few birds.

187
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,198
What do you say? Wanna put some pants on

188
00:10:17,234 --> 00:10:19,134
and help me save all of magic?

189
00:10:29,114 --> 00:10:31,114
<font color=#FF0000>- synced and corrected by sot26 -
www.addic7ed.com</font>

190
00:10:43,126 --> 00:10:45,560
I'll go talk to Eliot and Quentin.

191
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,540
- Uh, Kady...
- Just tell Penny

192
00:10:50,575 --> 00:10:53,510
that I went to find a quiet
place and do some dope.

193
00:10:53,545 --> 00:10:56,546
I'm ready to leave when he is.

194
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:05,288
Look... here's the deal.

195
00:11:06,051 --> 00:11:08,525
I just read your book
in the library, both volumes.

196
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,361
My book? Why?

197
00:11:11,396 --> 00:11:13,897
Because it ends the way
they all do in a couple days,

198
00:11:13,932 --> 00:11:16,399
with 20 blank pages.

199
00:11:16,435 --> 00:11:17,901
Something's about to happen,
something magical

200
00:11:17,936 --> 00:11:19,369
and really fu...
bad, and I think it's...

201
00:11:19,404 --> 00:11:23,206
It's Ember. He's been doing
all sorts of fu... up shit in Fillory,

202
00:11:23,241 --> 00:11:25,342
bucket list shit.

203
00:11:25,377 --> 00:11:26,343
What's in my book?

204
00:11:26,378 --> 00:11:27,911
You do your recon,

205
00:11:27,946 --> 00:11:30,180
find out Prince Ess of Loria
has taken Whitespire.

206
00:11:30,215 --> 00:11:31,414
Shit.

207
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:34,284
Then kidnap Idri, who I guess is a rat,

208
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:37,487
turn him back, then camp here
trying to find the perfect spell

209
00:11:37,522 --> 00:11:39,556
to force Ember to keep
his mitts off of Fillory.

210
00:11:39,591 --> 00:11:40,523
But if my book ends, then...

211
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:42,025
Then... exactly.

212
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,460
We know that doesn't work,

213
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:47,230
so you need to do
anything else... anything.

214
00:11:47,265 --> 00:11:49,299
Pick a plan and commit.

215
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:52,035
If it's written, isn't it written?

216
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,437
Yes, but I think you can change it.

217
00:11:54,473 --> 00:11:56,373
Okay, so we can save Fillory

218
00:11:56,408 --> 00:11:59,409
if we subscribe to a "free will"
view of the universe,

219
00:11:59,444 --> 00:12:00,577
which is fair.

220
00:12:00,612 --> 00:12:02,011
So what am I supposed to do?

221
00:12:02,047 --> 00:12:04,214
Go. Get Idri.

222
00:12:04,249 --> 00:12:06,116
Hurry.

223
00:12:06,151 --> 00:12:08,385
I just got one thing I gotta button up.

224
00:12:10,455 --> 00:12:12,088
Hey.

225
00:12:12,124 --> 00:12:14,023
I calculated a portal to Tahiti.

226
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:15,959
Hold up.

227
00:12:15,994 --> 00:12:17,494
No.

228
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:19,496
You warned them.

229
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,398
You've done enough. You get to be done.

230
00:12:21,433 --> 00:12:22,632
I'm sorry. Believe me, I'd rather...

231
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:24,667
No, none of it matters, Penny.

232
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,937
Oh, come on!

233
00:12:27,973 --> 00:12:30,173
Penny, you're needed at once.

234
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,108
- I'm busy.
- Bit of an emergency.

235
00:12:32,144 --> 00:12:33,443
We need our full staff.

236
00:12:33,478 --> 00:12:34,711
Are you crazy?

237
00:12:34,746 --> 00:12:36,246
He's dying.

238
00:12:36,281 --> 00:12:38,381
Yes, because he went
into a restricted area,

239
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:41,217
which lethally poisoned him
and puts him on strict probation,

240
00:12:41,253 --> 00:12:43,720
but most assuredly does not
mean he's excused from work.

241
00:12:43,755 --> 00:12:45,488
We'll take every step
to keep him comfortable.

242
00:12:45,524 --> 00:12:47,090
What the hell is wrong with you?

243
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:51,060
Kady, knowledge itself is at stake.

244
00:12:51,551 --> 00:12:54,030
That is more important
than any single one of us.

245
00:12:56,768 --> 00:12:58,501
I'll give you a moment to say good-bye.

246
00:12:58,537 --> 00:13:01,204
No. No, not good-bye.

247
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:03,440
- Kady, listen, I...
- No, I'm telling you,

248
00:13:03,475 --> 00:13:05,181
this isn't fair.

249
00:13:05,216 --> 00:13:07,310
God damn it!

250
00:13:07,345 --> 00:13:09,345
Fu...!

251
00:13:14,196 --> 00:13:15,317
<i>Just crack the damn lock.</i>

252
00:13:15,317 --> 00:13:17,208
<i>Hurry, before some
fairy asshole sees us.</i>

253
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:20,155
I'm going as fast as I can.

254
00:13:21,792 --> 00:13:25,527
Fen? Are you okay?

255
00:13:25,563 --> 00:13:27,029
Sweetie, do you know where you are?

256
00:13:27,064 --> 00:13:28,797
A plane laid atop our own,

257
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:32,067
so the Fairy Castle and
Whitespire actually occupy

258
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,803
the same space and time,
but two dimensions.

259
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:37,639
Or possibly the same dimension,
but incredibly sped up

260
00:13:37,675 --> 00:13:39,141
like that one episode of
"Star Trek" where...

261
00:13:39,176 --> 00:13:40,743
Just get the damn chain, Josh.

262
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,811
No.

263
00:13:42,847 --> 00:13:46,548
Not without my baby. They took her away.

264
00:13:46,584 --> 00:13:49,218
You have to come with us, okay?

265
00:13:49,253 --> 00:13:52,154
Get the goddamn shackles, Hoberman.

266
00:13:52,467 --> 00:13:54,117
Grab her with me. Come on.

267
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,594
Hey. Come on.

268
00:13:57,661 --> 00:13:59,528
There you are.

269
00:13:59,563 --> 00:14:01,530
The Queen will see you now.

270
00:14:26,557 --> 00:14:28,757
You've been making
yourself quite at home,

271
00:14:28,793 --> 00:14:32,127
sneaking around my castle.

272
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:33,862
It's actually more like my castle

273
00:14:33,898 --> 00:14:36,732
that you guys have made some
weird AM radio version of.

274
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:42,171
What is it that you seek,
rude little Earth girl?

275
00:14:42,206 --> 00:14:44,640
The woman and child you stole.

276
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:48,080
You made a deal.

277
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,613
That deal was inhumane bullshit

278
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:53,782
made under total duress.

279
00:14:54,819 --> 00:14:56,785
Look...

280
00:14:56,821 --> 00:14:58,654
just tell me what you want, okay, lady?

281
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,490
The child is mine.

282
00:15:02,827 --> 00:15:05,294
Now on to the business at hand.

283
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:07,196
No, the baby is the business.

284
00:15:07,231 --> 00:15:10,499
Ember is dangerously bored of Fillory.

285
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:14,102
You underestimated how
devastating it can be

286
00:15:14,138 --> 00:15:16,638
to displease a god.

287
00:15:16,674 --> 00:15:20,342
We've been trying to get
ahold of Ember for months.

288
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,910
He ignores us.

289
00:15:21,946 --> 00:15:25,447
Because you ask for things.

290
00:15:25,482 --> 00:15:28,684
Offer something to him instead.

291
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,489
How do you know all this?

292
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:36,491
As it is in our shared interest
for your High King to succeed,

293
00:15:36,527 --> 00:15:38,694
I'm inclined to let you go help him.

294
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:42,764
Great. Josh, Fen,
the baby and I will go right now.

295
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,334
You know it doesn't work that way.

296
00:15:45,369 --> 00:15:49,471
Now, are you familiar with this?

297
00:15:49,506 --> 00:15:51,807
- No.
- But goddamn.

298
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:53,576
Smells good.

299
00:15:53,777 --> 00:15:55,878
Even better to a god.

300
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:59,248
It will draw Ember.

301
00:15:59,283 --> 00:16:01,416
Take it. Bake it into...

302
00:16:01,452 --> 00:16:04,253
I know this one. Little cakes.

303
00:16:04,288 --> 00:16:06,655
He loves little cakes.

304
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:08,790
Okay.

305
00:16:08,826 --> 00:16:10,525
Point the way back.

306
00:16:10,561 --> 00:16:12,427
Certainly.

307
00:16:12,463 --> 00:16:15,697
As soon as I've exacted the toll.

308
00:16:15,733 --> 00:16:18,767
Travel from this world costs, dear.

309
00:16:18,802 --> 00:16:20,869
I don't make the rules.

310
00:16:20,905 --> 00:16:25,340
Oh, that's right. Yes, I do.

311
00:16:25,376 --> 00:16:28,243
We'll be seeing each
other soon I suspect.

312
00:16:36,587 --> 00:16:39,821
So, how's Alice?

313
00:16:39,857 --> 00:16:42,724
- Eliot, I...
- We need your help, Q.

314
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,961
You gave her the no-secret-cutting shit

315
00:16:45,996 --> 00:16:47,462
- from the keg, right?
- Yes.

316
00:16:47,498 --> 00:16:48,997
Physically, she's perfectly safe,

317
00:16:49,033 --> 00:16:52,634
but mentally... whew!

318
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:56,271
What am I supposed to do?

319
00:17:07,751 --> 00:17:10,919
You know what you learn
when you're a High King?

320
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,524
Screwing up is inevitable,

321
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:19,561
and there are some fu... ups
you can never un-fu...

322
00:17:19,596 --> 00:17:21,730
It's infuriating
and it is heartbreaking, but...

323
00:17:21,765 --> 00:17:23,966
Think I destroyed her, Eliot.

324
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,735
She made plenty of her
own choices along the way.

325
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:30,505
I'm not saying it doesn't suck.
I'm saying...

326
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,708
Fillory needs you.

327
00:17:32,743 --> 00:17:36,244
You chose to be a king.
This is what that means.

328
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,917
We have a plan, but...

329
00:17:43,654 --> 00:17:46,321
We need someone who
speaks fluent fanboy.

330
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:57,432
What on earth are you doing here,
sad little nerd king?

331
00:17:59,726 --> 00:18:01,828
You're sitting in my chair, asshole.

332
00:18:01,863 --> 00:18:02,929
Where the hell are the guards?

333
00:18:02,964 --> 00:18:04,130
Fast asleep, sorry.

334
00:18:04,165 --> 00:18:05,998
Watch where you point that thing.

335
00:18:06,403 --> 00:18:08,270
Dad.

336
00:18:08,305 --> 00:18:10,138
You're okay.

337
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:12,574
I-I had to do this. You were a rat.

338
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:14,676
Could I have my throne back now?

339
00:18:14,712 --> 00:18:16,178
I'll fight if you want.

340
00:18:16,213 --> 00:18:17,846
I've become pretty
boss with a broadsword.

341
00:18:17,882 --> 00:18:20,282
You have...

342
00:18:20,317 --> 00:18:21,517
so don't.

343
00:18:22,486 --> 00:18:24,686
Fine.

344
00:18:29,193 --> 00:18:31,293
Always did like to storm out.

345
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:35,364
I should go too.

346
00:18:35,399 --> 00:18:38,267
I should be there for my people,
whatever happens.

347
00:18:38,302 --> 00:18:39,501
You mean in case I fail?

348
00:18:39,537 --> 00:18:40,836
You won't.

349
00:18:41,872 --> 00:18:43,639
Hmm.

350
00:18:43,674 --> 00:18:46,375
You know, since Ember banished me,

351
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:52,247
I wonder if that nullified
my whole Fillorian contract.

352
00:18:57,521 --> 00:18:59,421
We could check.

353
00:19:12,636 --> 00:19:16,772
Uh, okay, so the thing is,
this blank spot,

354
00:19:16,807 --> 00:19:18,740
it's coming up fast, and it lines up

355
00:19:18,776 --> 00:19:21,209
with everything that you
were saying about Ember.

356
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:23,879
Is this tree too asymmetrical?

357
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:27,316
It's nice. I...

358
00:19:29,286 --> 00:19:31,687
So there's no way that you would
want to help us, like, at all?

359
00:19:33,424 --> 00:19:38,694
One cannot just show up
after one's faked one's own death.

360
00:19:38,729 --> 00:19:40,929
I'm sorry.

361
00:19:40,965 --> 00:19:43,332
The end of Fillory makes me sad as well.

362
00:19:43,367 --> 00:19:46,501
So Fillory really is done?

363
00:19:46,537 --> 00:19:48,570
I like you.

364
00:19:48,606 --> 00:19:51,273
You care about things.

365
00:19:51,308 --> 00:19:53,976
Yeah, it's not really a trait
that's helped me much.

366
00:19:54,011 --> 00:19:57,913
But it could be if it were applied
to not trying to fix the unfixable,

367
00:19:57,948 --> 00:20:02,751
but rather something
fresh and more perfect,

368
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:04,786
like, say...

369
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:12,461
Care to take a visit? Make some notes?

370
00:20:12,496 --> 00:20:14,329
- Um, I... uh...
- I'm sorry,

371
00:20:14,365 --> 00:20:16,264
but you're acting like I'm asking you,

372
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,401
whereas I am a god and
you are a hairless monkey,

373
00:20:19,436 --> 00:20:22,471
so nod and say thank you.

374
00:20:22,506 --> 00:20:23,972
All right.

375
00:20:24,008 --> 00:20:27,075
Let's go to the pocket world
formerly known as Cuba.

376
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:43,337
Whoa!

377
00:20:44,461 --> 00:20:46,728
Coming back from the fairy world

378
00:20:46,764 --> 00:20:49,498
is a little rockier than getting there.

379
00:20:49,533 --> 00:20:51,633
You don't fu... say.

380
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:53,635
Are you okay?

381
00:20:58,108 --> 00:21:00,742
Jesus.

382
00:21:00,778 --> 00:21:04,379
Fen wouldn't come because
they have your daughter.

383
00:21:04,415 --> 00:21:06,448
I'm sorry.

384
00:21:06,483 --> 00:21:08,984
I'll keep trying.

385
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:11,053
I promise, El.

386
00:21:11,088 --> 00:21:14,690
First we need to deal
with that cock, Ember.

387
00:21:14,725 --> 00:21:16,223
We come bearing bait.

388
00:21:21,065 --> 00:21:24,499
I look like Jack Sparrow
if he were played by a man.

389
00:21:24,535 --> 00:21:28,537
I was actually thinking more
like a Fembot Nick Fury.

390
00:21:32,643 --> 00:21:34,743
- Look...
- No, I need to...

391
00:21:34,778 --> 00:21:36,712
I know, okay?

392
00:21:36,747 --> 00:21:41,583
I was angry... and scared
of what you were capable of,

393
00:21:41,618 --> 00:21:44,386
but you were doing your best
in an impossible position

394
00:21:44,421 --> 00:21:47,856
that would've crushed anyone,
myself included.

395
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:49,991
Wait, is your good eye crying right now?

396
00:21:50,027 --> 00:21:52,627
No.

397
00:21:52,663 --> 00:21:54,663
Yes.

398
00:21:54,698 --> 00:21:57,499
And it's not my good eye,
it's my only fu... eye.

399
00:21:57,534 --> 00:21:59,968
- Eh...
- It's not funny,

400
00:22:00,003 --> 00:22:02,471
you dick, I'm a Cyclops!

401
00:22:02,506 --> 00:22:04,906
A mythological monster at last.

402
00:22:04,942 --> 00:22:07,042
Box... checked.

403
00:22:08,645 --> 00:22:10,145
We're trying too hard.

404
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,614
Pardon?

405
00:22:12,649 --> 00:22:14,983
To just blow past it and banter.

406
00:22:18,455 --> 00:22:21,456
It's not the same.
Let's not pretend it is, okay?

407
00:22:24,795 --> 00:22:26,661
That makes it hurt worse.

408
00:22:26,697 --> 00:22:29,131
I guess we'll just have
to live with the strain

409
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:33,435
till the future reveals itself.

410
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:36,104
Meantime, that future
is going to be a big, blank,

411
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:39,541
post-apocalyptic nada unless
we do what we do best.

412
00:22:39,576 --> 00:22:43,712
Act out with a total lack of
empathy and impulse control?

413
00:22:43,747 --> 00:22:46,982
Party like the world depends on it,

414
00:22:47,017 --> 00:22:48,884
'cause Bambi One Eye...

415
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:51,119
it do.

416
00:23:11,034 --> 00:23:12,500
Oh, my God.

417
00:23:12,536 --> 00:23:14,602
I threw better orgies when I was ten.

418
00:23:14,638 --> 00:23:17,105
I give you little cakes.

419
00:23:19,409 --> 00:23:22,010
I know they're irresistible,
it's the candied fairy hemp,

420
00:23:22,045 --> 00:23:25,747
but resist. This is
for our guest of honor.

421
00:23:47,571 --> 00:23:50,572
Be brutal.

422
00:23:51,942 --> 00:23:56,010
It's really... really linear.

423
00:24:16,233 --> 00:24:17,866
How's the linguini?

424
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:37,652
There's nothing wrong with it.

425
00:24:37,687 --> 00:24:39,020
Excellent.

426
00:24:39,055 --> 00:24:40,209
That's excellent.

427
00:24:41,992 --> 00:24:44,659
It's maybe a little, uh...

428
00:24:44,694 --> 00:24:45,693
Chewy?

429
00:24:45,729 --> 00:24:49,063
- Bland.
- Bland... good, or?

430
00:24:49,099 --> 00:24:50,965
Bland is never really good or bad.

431
00:24:51,001 --> 00:24:52,233
It appeals to all tastes.

432
00:24:52,269 --> 00:24:54,636
Sure, but...

433
00:24:54,671 --> 00:24:56,905
usually people, uh...

434
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,708
creatures who can think, gods even...

435
00:25:00,744 --> 00:25:03,444
sometimes like the unknown,
the unexpected,

436
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,947
even the offensive.

437
00:25:05,982 --> 00:25:07,682
Little bit of, uh...

438
00:25:16,226 --> 00:25:17,692
Chaos.

439
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,944
Happy now?

440
00:25:35,979 --> 00:25:37,779
You know who would love this,

441
00:25:37,814 --> 00:25:43,117
who would create an entire
world out of this greasy stain?

442
00:25:43,153 --> 00:25:44,686
My brother.

443
00:25:44,721 --> 00:25:46,821
Yes, Ember would make a mess.

444
00:25:46,856 --> 00:25:49,090
Do not speak to me of Ember!

445
00:25:51,194 --> 00:25:54,562
I like you, boy, but I have a temper.

446
00:25:55,659 --> 00:25:57,725
Wait, what about a human sacrifice?

447
00:25:57,761 --> 00:25:59,961
No, unless the cakes are bad.

448
00:26:00,572 --> 00:26:02,897
Well, they smell great,
but I don't think they're working, so...

449
00:26:02,933 --> 00:26:05,667
Little cakes.

450
00:26:05,702 --> 00:26:11,539
Mmm. Ohh. Mmm. Oh, oh.

451
00:26:11,575 --> 00:26:13,041
Oh, yes.

452
00:26:13,076 --> 00:26:16,644
Welcome, Ember, god of gods.

453
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:20,548
Wait, didn't I banish you?

454
00:26:20,584 --> 00:26:22,717
- You did, Lord of All, but...
- I didn't expect this.

455
00:26:22,752 --> 00:26:24,819
- I can explain.
- I...

456
00:26:24,855 --> 00:26:26,054
love it!

457
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:27,088
- Ha.
- A genuine twist,

458
00:26:27,124 --> 00:26:28,559
a true surprise.

459
00:26:28,792 --> 00:26:30,725
When was the last time
that happened around here?

460
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,161
Exactly,
and we're really sorry about that.

461
00:26:33,196 --> 00:26:36,731
We've fallen down on the job,
but boredom is death.

462
00:26:36,766 --> 00:26:38,633
- I totally agree.
- Ugh, isn't it though?

463
00:26:38,668 --> 00:26:40,001
- It is.
- Mm.

464
00:26:40,036 --> 00:26:43,037
But... we can make Fillory more exciting

465
00:26:43,073 --> 00:26:46,474
and... and watchable than ever.

466
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:48,143
That's our pitch. It's a new chapter

467
00:26:48,178 --> 00:26:52,213
and the title is
"Shit Tons of Drama and Surprise."

468
00:26:52,249 --> 00:26:54,716
Intriguing.

469
00:26:56,753 --> 00:26:57,986
How?

470
00:26:58,021 --> 00:26:59,654
Don't destroy Fillory.

471
00:26:59,689 --> 00:27:01,589
Shake things up, yes.

472
00:27:01,625 --> 00:27:02,690
Like the rats.

473
00:27:02,726 --> 00:27:04,125
Yeah, rats, hilarious.

474
00:27:04,161 --> 00:27:05,827
It was good, wasn't it?

475
00:27:05,862 --> 00:27:06,995
- Yes. Yes.
- We're all still laughing.

476
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,163
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

477
00:27:08,198 --> 00:27:09,464
- Right, laughing?
- Laughing!

478
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:16,004
There's so much more to do here,

479
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:18,940
so many twists and surprises
this world can offer.

480
00:27:18,975 --> 00:27:21,075
- Mm.
- Think back to the moment

481
00:27:21,111 --> 00:27:23,811
you created the first blades of grass.

482
00:27:23,847 --> 00:27:26,047
- Sentient trees.
- Talking animals.

483
00:27:26,082 --> 00:27:27,549
- The Wellspring.
- Think back

484
00:27:27,584 --> 00:27:30,885
to what you built with
your brother Umber.

485
00:27:30,921 --> 00:27:34,255
My brother, rest his soul,
was nothing but a simpering,

486
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:37,525
sniping, anal retentive critic,
as well as a...

487
00:27:37,561 --> 00:27:40,828
Greedy, promiscuous, selfish,

488
00:27:40,864 --> 00:27:44,599
credit-hogging, mouse-eating slob!

489
00:27:44,634 --> 00:27:45,852
Any talk of this is mere whimsy,

490
00:27:45,852 --> 00:27:48,203
and it's whimsy itself that I
am tired of and finished with.

491
00:27:48,238 --> 00:27:51,706
We get it, we do. I mean,
try ruling a world of whimsy.

492
00:27:51,741 --> 00:27:52,840
- Am I right?
- Mm.

493
00:27:52,876 --> 00:27:54,676
Not so whimsical, actually.

494
00:27:54,711 --> 00:27:56,711
Well, then, let's get it over with.

495
00:27:56,746 --> 00:27:58,246
Why wait?

496
00:27:58,281 --> 00:28:00,048
Let's start right now.

497
00:28:00,376 --> 00:28:01,549
No, no, no, no, no, no!

498
00:28:01,585 --> 00:28:02,675
Not what we meant...

499
00:28:03,053 --> 00:28:06,521
Rewind! Rewind! Rewind! Rewind! Rewind!

500
00:28:10,227 --> 00:28:12,026
Stop! Are you insane?

501
00:28:12,062 --> 00:28:14,829
No! I mean, we meant...
make it better, make it better.

502
00:28:14,864 --> 00:28:17,699
Less whimsical, more...
meaner maybe, more you.

503
00:28:17,734 --> 00:28:19,801
Maybe, if I didn't have to do it alone.

504
00:28:19,836 --> 00:28:22,270
Say what you will about my dear,
departed brother,

505
00:28:22,305 --> 00:28:24,739
but he was a demon for overwork.

506
00:28:24,774 --> 00:28:26,174
Hmm. He had a strange love for this...

507
00:28:26,209 --> 00:28:28,276
Poor, accursed place.

508
00:28:28,311 --> 00:28:30,511
Too late to be helped now. I...

509
00:28:30,547 --> 00:28:32,647
couldn't bear to go back. I-I won't.

510
00:28:33,501 --> 00:28:36,284
- I won't.
- Um, actually, we're already there.

511
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:38,119
Where?

512
00:28:38,154 --> 00:28:40,788
Apocalypse! Apocalypse! Apocalypse!

513
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:43,791
Isn't it wonderful?

514
00:28:48,164 --> 00:28:49,697
What are you doing?

515
00:28:49,733 --> 00:28:51,599
You're making a mess!

516
00:28:59,976 --> 00:29:02,510
I'm...

517
00:29:02,545 --> 00:29:03,596
back.

518
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,980
You're alive.

519
00:29:08,184 --> 00:29:10,785
How is this possible, brother?

520
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:15,023
You died battling Martin to save me.

521
00:29:17,694 --> 00:29:19,961
Why are you afraid? I...

522
00:29:19,996 --> 00:29:23,264
I am... so pleased.

523
00:29:28,238 --> 00:29:31,873
Martin told me you died...

524
00:29:31,908 --> 00:29:33,341
when he banished me.

525
00:29:33,376 --> 00:29:35,243
Hey, guys, how about a hug?

526
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:37,111
This is a family reunion.

527
00:29:37,147 --> 00:29:38,813
This was a family betrayal.

528
00:29:40,031 --> 00:29:40,782
Wasn't it?

529
00:29:42,285 --> 00:29:45,353
- Wasn't it?
- No!

530
00:29:45,388 --> 00:29:46,988
No!

531
00:29:47,023 --> 00:29:48,189
I can't be here!

532
00:29:48,224 --> 00:29:50,591
Oh! All this time, I thought,

533
00:29:50,627 --> 00:29:55,129
"Martin, so powerful."

534
00:29:55,165 --> 00:29:57,031
But no.

535
00:29:57,067 --> 00:30:01,269
He was merely a brilliant dealmaker.

536
00:30:01,304 --> 00:30:06,407
My banishment for your life.

537
00:30:06,443 --> 00:30:10,078
Your puny, petty,

538
00:30:10,113 --> 00:30:14,082
putrid nothing of a soul spark!

539
00:30:19,055 --> 00:30:20,455
Brother, please?

540
00:30:22,859 --> 00:30:24,025
Please!

541
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,127
You... always... were

542
00:30:26,162 --> 00:30:27,662
the weak one.

543
00:30:48,218 --> 00:30:50,218
Come and get me, you fu... baby.

544
00:30:51,955 --> 00:30:53,388
You want to know why you're so bored?

545
00:30:53,423 --> 00:30:56,090
Because you're too stupid to get it.

546
00:30:56,126 --> 00:30:59,093
You're too spoiled and
entitled to understand...

547
00:30:59,129 --> 00:31:02,130
How dare you? I am a god.

548
00:31:02,165 --> 00:31:04,832
Are you? Really?

549
00:31:04,868 --> 00:31:06,467
I'm not impressed.

550
00:31:06,503 --> 00:31:10,071
I've met scary gods, and you?

551
00:31:10,106 --> 00:31:12,807
You're nothing but a petty tyrant.

552
00:31:21,317 --> 00:31:22,449
Quentin...

553
00:31:24,421 --> 00:31:27,789
You... always...

554
00:31:27,824 --> 00:31:28,956
surprise.

555
00:31:42,305 --> 00:31:44,305
Holy fu...

556
00:31:46,009 --> 00:31:49,010
Q?

557
00:31:49,045 --> 00:31:51,446
I think you just saved the whole world.

558
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,775
<i>We are officially a land
of godless heathens,</i>

559
00:32:07,811 --> 00:32:11,579
making today the first day
of our societal adulthood.

560
00:32:11,614 --> 00:32:15,883
I, for one, am slightly terrified
and equally excited.

561
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,719
And trying not to break into "Hamilton."

562
00:32:17,754 --> 00:32:20,922
And so, I turn over the
next phase of our maturation

563
00:32:20,957 --> 00:32:23,124
to our High Queen Margo.

564
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:25,259
We need a constitution.

565
00:32:25,295 --> 00:32:26,061
Pardon?

566
00:32:26,061 --> 00:32:30,198
These are some pretty good ones here,
so let's rip off the best parts.

567
00:32:42,078 --> 00:32:44,078
Hungry?

568
00:32:45,782 --> 00:32:50,952
I know Mayakovsky said soft,
bland food for a while, but...

569
00:32:50,987 --> 00:32:54,822
I can see that's not really working.

570
00:32:54,858 --> 00:32:57,759
So I stopped by the farm

571
00:32:57,794 --> 00:33:02,063
where Fogg gets his
weekly rasher of bacon.

572
00:33:02,098 --> 00:33:03,231
No thanks.

573
00:33:03,266 --> 00:33:05,299
You sure?

574
00:33:05,335 --> 00:33:06,217
Because...

575
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:09,971
I tried it...

576
00:33:10,006 --> 00:33:13,608
and, uh,

577
00:33:13,643 --> 00:33:15,643
it's amazing.

578
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:19,781
I know what you're trying to do.

579
00:33:19,816 --> 00:33:24,619
I'm... just trying to do
breakfast food, that's all.

580
00:33:31,861 --> 00:33:34,262
Oh, fu... you.

581
00:33:36,332 --> 00:33:38,633
Mmm.

582
00:33:38,668 --> 00:33:40,168
Please.

583
00:33:46,176 --> 00:33:47,742
Fu...

584
00:33:47,777 --> 00:33:50,278
Gluttony.

585
00:33:50,313 --> 00:33:52,780
It's an excellent part of being human.

586
00:33:54,451 --> 00:33:57,151
I don't remember many others.

587
00:33:57,187 --> 00:33:58,319
Really?

588
00:34:01,124 --> 00:34:02,690
Ugh.

589
00:34:04,694 --> 00:34:07,962
Hmm, my hands are all greasy.

590
00:34:07,997 --> 00:34:09,931
Ugh.

591
00:34:09,966 --> 00:34:14,035
With every good thing,
no matter how small it is,

592
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:16,370
it's always...

593
00:34:16,406 --> 00:34:20,041
married to something
so completely disgusting.

594
00:34:20,076 --> 00:34:22,176
You can't escape it.

595
00:34:22,212 --> 00:34:24,045
You're right.

596
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:27,048
It's gross. We are animals.

597
00:34:44,868 --> 00:34:47,034
Why does that feel so good?

598
00:34:52,842 --> 00:34:55,843
I don't know.

599
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:59,213
It just does.

600
00:34:59,249 --> 00:35:01,883
It always did.

601
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,863
Hmm.

602
00:35:38,221 --> 00:35:41,389
Look... I need your help.

603
00:35:46,447 --> 00:35:48,432
_

604
00:35:48,467 --> 00:35:51,297
_

605
00:35:51,298 --> 00:35:55,135
_

606
00:35:55,136 --> 00:35:58,741
_

607
00:35:58,742 --> 00:36:02,274
_

608
00:36:03,112 --> 00:36:04,445
I'm not gonna beg.

609
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,014
I'm not gonna use guilt,
I have no leverage.

610
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:10,117
But Penny's in the Library.
He can be your mole.

611
00:36:10,153 --> 00:36:12,420
But to do that, he'd have to be alive.

612
00:36:14,139 --> 00:36:15,904
_

613
00:36:18,127 --> 00:36:20,361
He'd never know.

614
00:36:20,396 --> 00:36:22,230
Whatever you need, ask me about it.

615
00:36:22,265 --> 00:36:24,398
He tells me, I tell you.

616
00:36:24,699 --> 00:36:27,135
_

617
00:36:28,871 --> 00:36:31,472
Who saved her man's life, so maybe not.

618
00:36:31,507 --> 00:36:33,374
Big picture, right?

619
00:36:34,978 --> 00:36:36,177
Deal?

620
00:36:38,481 --> 00:36:40,481
Deal.

621
00:36:42,819 --> 00:36:48,522
I probably shouldn't say this
out loud, but...

622
00:36:48,558 --> 00:36:52,126
this was kind of an okay day.

623
00:36:52,161 --> 00:36:54,061
Are you bragging?

624
00:36:54,097 --> 00:36:56,097
No.

625
00:36:57,567 --> 00:36:59,900
Kind of.

626
00:36:59,936 --> 00:37:02,937
Not about this... entirely.

627
00:37:05,475 --> 00:37:08,409
I also kind of killed a god.

628
00:37:10,162 --> 00:37:13,281
Huh. Hilarious.

629
00:37:13,316 --> 00:37:15,916
No, seriously.

630
00:37:16,574 --> 00:37:18,152
Ember.

631
00:37:20,356 --> 00:37:24,892
I mean, he was...
erasing the whole thing.

632
00:37:24,927 --> 00:37:28,062
Wait, wait, you can't be serious.

633
00:37:28,097 --> 00:37:29,297
Yeah.

634
00:37:29,332 --> 00:37:31,165
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

635
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,434
No, I didn't want to.
He had just killed his brother.

636
00:37:33,469 --> 00:37:37,171
He was going after Julia.
He was genocidally insane.

637
00:37:37,206 --> 00:37:39,340
You don't get it.

638
00:37:39,375 --> 00:37:40,608
Jesus.

639
00:37:40,643 --> 00:37:43,010
When I was a-a niffin, I saw things.

640
00:37:43,046 --> 00:37:45,112
I saw everything from
the beginning of time.

641
00:37:45,148 --> 00:37:46,614
- Calm down...
- No, I understand

642
00:37:46,649 --> 00:37:48,382
the way the universe works, Q,

643
00:37:48,418 --> 00:37:51,919
the Wellspring,
the hierarchies, the plumbing.

644
00:37:51,954 --> 00:37:54,322
I was inside it.

645
00:37:54,357 --> 00:37:58,526
Gods like Ember have parents, you idiot!

646
00:37:58,561 --> 00:38:00,027
I-I'm not following.

647
00:38:00,063 --> 00:38:02,196
The old gods,
the creators of the universe,

648
00:38:02,231 --> 00:38:04,231
of all magic itself.

649
00:38:04,267 --> 00:38:06,500
<i>To Ember, we're like... we're like toys,</i>

650
00:38:06,536 --> 00:38:09,136
<i>but to them we're... we're cells.</i>

651
00:38:09,172 --> 00:38:10,538
When we're harmless they ignore us,

652
00:38:10,573 --> 00:38:13,441
but when we become malignant,
they amputate.

653
00:38:13,476 --> 00:38:15,242
Now, if you're gonna use
stones like this,

654
00:38:15,278 --> 00:38:16,544
it's imperative that...

655
00:38:18,214 --> 00:38:20,381
Excuse me.

656
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,149
Excuse me, this is...

657
00:38:22,877 --> 00:38:26,587
Okay, wait.
Like, so there's an actual plumber?

658
00:38:26,622 --> 00:38:29,156
<i>Like the Mario Brother of the gods?</i>

659
00:38:29,192 --> 00:38:30,524
- Yes.
- And he can just...

660
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,393
I guarantee you, he's doing it.

661
00:38:42,238 --> 00:38:44,138
<i>Attention, please keep calm</i>

662
00:38:44,173 --> 00:38:46,374
<i>and follow all code green procedures.</i>

663
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:49,377
<i>Please remember not to
interact and simply gather...</i>

664
00:38:53,316 --> 00:38:55,916
<i>Attention,
please keep calm and follow...</i>

665
00:39:13,536 --> 00:39:14,969
Professor?

666
00:39:15,004 --> 00:39:17,304
Mayakovsky!

667
00:39:24,614 --> 00:39:26,614
Holy shit.

668
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,720
_

669
00:39:32,721 --> 00:39:36,224
All right, everyone,
open your books to chapter 16.

670
00:39:55,445 --> 00:39:59,380
Who can translate the Borkulo Rendering

671
00:39:59,416 --> 00:40:01,516
from its original Hungarian?

672
00:40:02,752 --> 00:40:05,453
No point in raising hands.

673
00:40:05,488 --> 00:40:07,088
Remember?

674
00:40:08,592 --> 00:40:09,624
I can.

675
00:40:09,659 --> 00:40:11,726
Dean Fogg? Sorry to interrupt.

676
00:40:11,761 --> 00:40:13,862
Yes, Josh, go ahead.

677
00:40:13,897 --> 00:40:15,496
Well, I was online last night...

678
00:40:15,532 --> 00:40:17,932
The answer is no.

679
00:40:17,968 --> 00:40:20,401
There is no actual evidence

680
00:40:20,437 --> 00:40:24,072
of a magical surge in Sedona, Arizona.

681
00:40:24,107 --> 00:40:25,073
Yeah, but what about in...

682
00:40:25,108 --> 00:40:26,574
Or Kenya,

683
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:30,345
or Machu Picchu, or China...

684
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,980
or anywhere.

685
00:40:34,551 --> 00:40:37,051
Magic is gone.

686
00:40:37,087 --> 00:40:39,087
The best we can do is accept that,

687
00:40:39,122 --> 00:40:41,489
and continue our theoretical studies,

688
00:40:41,524 --> 00:40:44,626
to stay ready for its return.

689
00:40:44,661 --> 00:40:46,628
So you think that's possible?

690
00:40:46,663 --> 00:40:48,863
Anything is possible, Alice.

691
00:40:48,899 --> 00:40:50,798
Was, anyway.

692
00:40:54,104 --> 00:40:56,404
Look at you,

693
00:40:56,439 --> 00:40:59,774
playing the part of the bright,
young girl.

694
00:40:59,809 --> 00:41:01,075
Joseph?

695
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:05,546
Ah, yes.

696
00:41:05,582 --> 00:41:08,616
I can see my Alice in there still.

697
00:41:08,652 --> 00:41:09,851
Good.

698
00:41:12,389 --> 00:41:13,755
Are you all right?

699
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:16,925
I am as I appear... dying.

700
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,827
So it is true.

701
00:41:19,863 --> 00:41:21,429
Magic's gone everywhere.

702
00:41:21,464 --> 00:41:26,134
The creatures, cryptids,
sylphs, dragons, unicorns,

703
00:41:26,169 --> 00:41:30,705
even the pointless vampires
are all as they were.

704
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:34,742
But those of us who drew on
the power of the Wellspring,

705
00:41:34,778 --> 00:41:37,879
well, as you can see...

706
00:41:37,914 --> 00:41:39,847
- I want to help.
- I'm here, Alice,

707
00:41:39,883 --> 00:41:41,983
because it is you who needs help.

708
00:41:42,018 --> 00:41:45,787
- What?
- As a niffin, you made enemies.

709
00:41:45,822 --> 00:41:48,957
I'm here to warn you that
one of them seeks you.

710
00:41:48,992 --> 00:41:50,058
Who?

711
00:41:50,093 --> 00:41:51,626
The Lamprey.

712
00:41:51,661 --> 00:41:55,930
You do recall what
you did to his family?

713
00:41:55,966 --> 00:41:56,864
Yes.

714
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,599
Most amusing at the time,

715
00:41:58,635 --> 00:42:02,070
but to The Lamprey, cause for vengeance.

716
00:42:02,105 --> 00:42:05,840
It knows you're weak.
It knows you're here.

717
00:42:10,447 --> 00:42:12,613
What do I...

718
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:14,182
Oh...

719
00:42:17,854 --> 00:42:21,522
Democracy has to take a backseat.

720
00:42:21,558 --> 00:42:25,560
Without magic, the people are terrified,

721
00:42:25,595 --> 00:42:28,029
and that is just one step
from an angry mob.

722
00:42:28,064 --> 00:42:30,098
And that's how royal heads
end up in baskets.

723
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:32,200
I get it. I get it.

724
00:42:32,235 --> 00:42:38,639
This is an undereducated,
pre-industrial populous, Eliot.

725
00:42:38,675 --> 00:42:40,241
They need to be ruled.

726
00:42:40,276 --> 00:42:43,578
They need to be inspired.

727
00:42:43,613 --> 00:42:45,880
They need to think
they're being inspired

728
00:42:45,915 --> 00:42:47,749
as they're being ruled.

729
00:42:47,784 --> 00:42:51,686
I'm talking curfew,
martial law, conscription,

730
00:42:51,721 --> 00:42:53,654
and severe and public punishment.

731
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:56,190
Okay. Can we maybe make our way

732
00:42:56,226 --> 00:42:58,426
to King and Queen Caligula, please?
Maybe a...

733
00:42:58,461 --> 00:43:00,995
How do you not recognize me?
I'm the King's wife!

734
00:43:01,031 --> 00:43:02,730
- Tell them!
- Oh, my God.

735
00:43:07,904 --> 00:43:09,537
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

736
00:43:09,572 --> 00:43:11,037
How did you get here?

737
00:43:12,402 --> 00:43:13,342
Simple.

738
00:43:13,877 --> 00:43:15,743
I just gave them my toes.

739
00:43:15,779 --> 00:43:18,146
Gave... who your toes?

740
00:43:18,181 --> 00:43:19,814
The fairies.

741
00:43:21,785 --> 00:43:23,751
I wanted to stay...

742
00:43:23,787 --> 00:43:28,222
to be close to our daughter,
but I had to warn you.

743
00:43:28,258 --> 00:43:29,657
They're coming.

744
00:43:31,895 --> 00:43:33,694
They're here.

745
00:44:16,673 --> 00:44:17,872
Boo.

746
00:44:19,175 --> 00:44:20,074
Hey.

747
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:21,242
Hey.

748
00:44:21,277 --> 00:44:22,743
Jules, I...

749
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:24,378
Hi.

750
00:44:26,816 --> 00:44:28,883
How did you get in here?

751
00:44:28,918 --> 00:44:32,720
Well, your...
your fence is a little shoddy.

752
00:44:32,755 --> 00:44:34,956
Right.

753
00:44:34,991 --> 00:44:37,692
Welcome to the new normal.

754
00:44:37,727 --> 00:44:40,795
You know, 'cause I killed
all magic fu... everywhere.

755
00:44:41,283 --> 00:44:43,631
Uh... Sorry.

756
00:44:43,666 --> 00:44:46,801
That was definitely a two-hander.

757
00:44:46,836 --> 00:44:48,903
I'll be burning in hell
right next to you,

758
00:44:48,938 --> 00:44:51,038
but hey, at least we have each other.

759
00:44:51,074 --> 00:44:54,008
Hmm.

760
00:44:54,043 --> 00:44:56,944
So how are you?

761
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:58,613
Fine.

762
00:44:58,648 --> 00:45:01,916
- Listen...
- How's law school?

763
00:45:01,951 --> 00:45:03,017
I quit.

764
00:45:03,052 --> 00:45:05,219
Okay.

765
00:45:05,255 --> 00:45:08,022
Why?

766
00:45:08,057 --> 00:45:12,827
Because I need to show you something,

767
00:45:12,862 --> 00:45:16,697
and you need to promise me that
you're not going to tell anyone,

768
00:45:16,733 --> 00:45:19,300
'cause you're the only
person that I trust.

769
00:45:21,337 --> 00:45:23,004
I promise.

770
00:45:28,945 --> 00:45:30,111
Jules, it's not gonna work.

771
00:45:30,146 --> 00:45:32,947
Just give me a second.

772
00:45:33,499 --> 00:45:35,750
We all get flashes
that we can do it again, but it's...

773
00:45:37,854 --> 00:45:39,384
Oh, my God.

774
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:43,124
How?

775
00:45:43,159 --> 00:45:46,160
I have no idea.
