EMBER: <i>Hello, glorious audience,</i>

2
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:05,570
<i>it is I, Ember, God of Fillory.</i>

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:07,938
<i>Feel free to bow
and grovel. I'll wait.</i>

4
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,102
<i>Oh, but I've got
so much to tell you.</i>

5
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:13,375
<i>I, with minor help from
my brother, Umber, RIP,</i>

6
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:16,940
<i>created a world
intricate as filigree.</i>

7
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:22,183
<i>And that is what I called it. Except
I was a bit drunk so... "Fillory."</i>

8
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:26,159
<i>Chock-stuffed with magic,
chatty animals, sexy creatures.</i>

9
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:28,252
<i>Really, what a planet.</i>

10
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:31,560
<i>I calibrated everything for
maximum entertainment.</i>

11
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:34,761
<i>I decreed it be ruled
by Children of Earth,</i>

12
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:37,395
<i>a glum little planet known
for its plucky Magicians.</i>

13
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:40,964
<i>These brave souls would come, and
when they got boring, off they went.</i>

14
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:45,245
<i>Case in point, Martin
Chatwin. Brave, clever boy.</i>

15
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,541
<i>Born hero.</i>

16
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:50,345
<i>Yet, honestly, very uncomfortable
to watch once he'd been molested.</i>

17
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:53,251
<i>So I made the difficult
decision to kick him out</i>

18
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,983
<i>and replace him with
someone more punchy and fun.</i>

19
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,390
<i>But Martin was more tenacious
than I gave him credit for.</i>

20
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,724
<i>He drank from the
Wellspring to get strong,</i>

21
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,923
<i>screwing Fillory in the process,</i>

22
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:06,023
<i>and set booby traps
for my brother and me.</i>

23
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:07,931
<i>And before you
know it, Umber's dead,</i>

24
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:11,403
<i>and I'm hiding in stupid Loria.</i>

25
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:13,633
I'm so fucking bored,
Children of Earth.

26

EMBER: <i>Cut to...</i>

27
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:17,710
<i>Martin's mutated into a
terrible beast in a dapper suit.</i>

28
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:20,338
<i>Enter Quentin
Coldwater and his friends,</i>

29
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:25,478
<i>the Addict, the Victim, the
Bitch, the Scowl and the Martyr.</i>

30
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:28,989
<i>I bestowed my blessing and
they set out to kill The Beast.</i>

31
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:30,183
<i>Of course they failed.</i>

32
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,350
<i>Twist!</i>

33
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,020
<i>They have to start from
scratch with The Beast. Thrilling!</i>

34
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,895
<i>The danger of sublimated trauma
is a major theme in our story,</i>

35
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:39,934
<i>evidenced by Julia and Martin</i>

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,868
<i>teaming up to kill the
Earth god who violated her.</i>

37
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,962
<i>All very ambiguous and poignant,</i>

38
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:46,506
<i>I know!</i>

39
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:49,839
<i>Julia's partnership also threw a
massive wrench into Quentin's works.</i>

40
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,242
<i>Gut-wrenching!</i>

41
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:54,008
<i>I was forced to
intervene. Cameo!</i>

42
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:56,710
I have befouled the Wellspring.

43
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:59,216
<i>Wasn't it tragic
when Alice died?</i>

44
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,812
<i>Wasn't it scary when
she became a Niffin?</i>

45
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:06,223
<i>The personal nature of her story
subverted Quentin's hero's journey nicely.</i>

46
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,455
<i>Character is destiny,
and, ultimately,</i>

47
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,326
<i>Quentin is a
Magician of intellect,</i>

48
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:14,027
<i>who nevertheless, and to his
detriment, acts from his heart.</i>

49
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:17,731
<i>But I did other things too, like
lead Quentin to that candy witch.</i>

50
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,170
<i>Don't worry, that'll pay off.</i>

51
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,504
<i>I hid the Wellspring
bowl in plain sight.</i>

52
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:23,407
<i>Made the Rainbow Bridge bloom.</i>

53

good and angry when Penny stiffed him.</i>

<i>A royal child of Whitespire.</i>

63
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:43,222
<i>Take her to the dungeon.</i>

00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:35,401
but I can tell you the way you're relating
to that couch is not unknown to me.

174
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,808
Then you know I
want to be alone.

175
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:43,875
And, um, also that you
probably shouldn't be right now.

176
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:45,746
Why do you care?

177
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,412
I just do.

178
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,589
Come with me

179
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:55,458
and help me try to convince
Ember to let us keep Fillory.

180
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:56,888
Why?

181
00:09:56,963 --> 00:10:00,900
Because I have never met anyone
less willing to take no for an answer.

182
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,458
But I betrayed you, remember?

183

00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,032

need help, and you do, too.

187
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,182
What do you say?

188
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,879
Wanna put some pants on
and help me save all of magic?

189
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,278
I'll go talk to
Eliot and Quentin.

190
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:50,843
Uh, Kady...

191
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:54,410
Just tell Penny that I went to
find a quiet place to do some dope.

192
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,718
I'm ready to leave when he is.

193
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,921
Look, here's the deal.

194
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,977
I just read your
book in the Library.

195
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,025
Both volumes.

196
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:11,931
My book? Why?

197
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,640
Because it ends the way
they all do in a couple days.

198
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,005
With 20 blank pages.

199
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,287
Something's about to happen.

200
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:19,655
Something magical,
and really fucking bad.

201
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,307
And I think it's... It's Ember.

202
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:23,646
He's been doing all sorts
of fucked up shit in Fillory.

203
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,275
"Bucket list" shit.

204
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,043
What's in my book?

205
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,177
You do your recon,

206
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:30,889
find out Prince Ess of
Loria has taken Whitespire.

207
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:32,016
Shit.

208
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:35,061
Then kidnap Idri,
who I guess is a rat?

209
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:36,858
Turn him back, then camp here

210
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,455
trying to find the perfect spell

211
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,411
to force Ember to keep
his mitts off of Fillory.

212
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,799
But if my book ends
then... Then... Exactly.

213
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,269
We know that doesn't work.

214
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:49,605
So you need to do anything else.
Anything. Pick a plan and commit.

215
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,777
If it's written,
isn't it written?

216
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:55,280
Yes. But I think
you can change it.

217
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:57,146
Okay, so we can save Fillory

218
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:01,382
if we subscribe to a free-will
view of the universe, which is fair.

219
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:02,498
So what am I supposed to do?

220
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:06,323
Go. Get Idri. Hurry.

me, I'd rather...

00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:25,504
No. None of it matters, Penny.

Are you crazy? He's dying.

233
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:39,051
Yes, because he went
into a restricted area,

234
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,993
which lethally poisoned him
and puts him on strict probation,

235
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,496
but most assuredly does not
mean he is excused from work.

to keep him comfortable.

itself is at stake.

That is more important
than any single one of us.

to say goodbye.

possibly the same dimension,

I'm here, Alice, because
it is you who needs help.

703
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,999
What?

704
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:52,737
As a Niffin, you made enemies.

705
00:41:53,144 --> 00:41:56,012
I'm here to warn you that
one of them seeks you.

706
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,104
Who?

707
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,274
The Lamprey.

708
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,217
You do recall what
you did to his family?

709
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:03,711
Yes.

710
00:42:03,788 --> 00:42:05,313
Most amusing at the time.

711
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:09,157
But to The Lamprey,
cause for vengeance.

712
00:42:09,227 --> 00:42:12,356
It knows you're weak.
It knows you're here.

713
00:42:17,168 --> 00:42:18,363
What...

714
00:42:20,338 --> 00:42:21,397
(GASPING)

715
00:42:25,176 --> 00:42:28,635
MARGO: Democracy
has to take a backseat.

716
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:32,582
Without magic, the
people are terrified.

717
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:35,210
And that is just one
step from an angry mob...

718
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:37,380
And that's how royal
heads end up in baskets.

719
00:42:37,455 --> 00:42:39,424
I get it. I get it.

720
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:45,691
This is an undereducated,
pre-industrial populace, Eliot.

721
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:47,322
They need to be ruled.

722
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,594
They need to be inspired.

723
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:54,764
They need to think they're being
inspired, as they're being ruled.

724
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:58,833
I'm talking curfew,
martial law, conscription

725
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,538
and severe and
public punishment.

726
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:04,912
Okay, can we maybe make our way
to King and Queen Caligula, please?

727
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:05,982
Maybe, uh...

728
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:08,645
How do you not recognize
me? I'm the king's wife, tell them.

729
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:09,812
Oh, my God.

730
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:16,652
ELIOT: Are you okay? Yes.

731
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:18,525
How did you get here?

732
00:43:19,464 --> 00:43:22,832
Simple. (SNIFFS) I
just gave them my toes.

733
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,529
Gave who your toes?

734
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:26,934
The Fairies.

735
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,866
I wanted to stay,

736
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:34,470
to be close to our daughter,
but I had to warn you.

737
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:36,707
They're coming.

738
00:43:38,683 --> 00:43:39,742
They're here.

739
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:42,043
(GASPS) (GOBLET CLATTERS)

740
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:25,020
Boo.

741
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:27,456
Hey.

742
00:44:27,532 --> 00:44:28,591
Hey.

743
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,032
QUENTIN: Jules, I...

744
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:31,964
JULIA: Hi. (LAUGHS)

745
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:35,807
How did you get in here?

746
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:38,907
Well, your fence
is a little shoddy.

747
00:44:39,911 --> 00:44:41,072
Right.

748
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,615
Welcome to the new normal.

749
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,777
You know, 'cause I killed
all magic fucking everywhere.

750
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:49,285
(BOTH SCOFFING)

751
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:53,182
JULIA: Sorry, that was
definitely a two-hander,

752
00:44:53,758 --> 00:44:55,784
I'll be burning in
hell right next to you.

753
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,159
But, hey, at least
we have each other.

754
00:44:58,229 --> 00:44:59,288
Hmm.

755
00:45:01,232 --> 00:45:02,996
So, how are you?

756
00:45:04,302 --> 00:45:05,770
Fine.

757
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:08,032
Listen... How's law school?

758
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,164
I quit.

759
00:45:10,508 --> 00:45:12,977
Okay. Why?

760
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:18,281
Because I need to
show you something.

761
00:45:19,984 --> 00:45:23,386
And you need to promise me
that you're not going to tell anyone.

762
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:26,252
'Cause you're the
only person that I trust.

763
00:45:28,826 --> 00:45:30,158
I promise.

764
00:45:36,334 --> 00:45:37,529
Jules, it's not gonna work.

765
00:45:37,602 --> 00:45:40,162
Just gimme a second. (SIGHS)

766
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:43,106
We all get flashes that
we can do it again, but it's...

767
00:45:43,174 --> 00:45:44,174
(SIZZLING)

768
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:46,738
Oh, my God. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

769
00:45:47,612 --> 00:45:48,612
How?

770
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:51,839
I have no idea.
