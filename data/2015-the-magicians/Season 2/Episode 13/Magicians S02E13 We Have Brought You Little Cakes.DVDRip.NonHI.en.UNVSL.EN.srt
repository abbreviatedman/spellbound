00:00:01,068 --> 00:00:03,128
<i>Hello, glorious audience,</i>

2
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:05,570
<i>it is I, Ember, God of Fillory.</i>

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:07,938
<i>Feel free to bow
and grovel. I'll wait.</i>

4
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:10,102
<i>Oh, but I've got
so much to tell you.</i>

5
00:00:10,177 --> 00:00:13,375
<i>I, with minor help from
my brother, Umber, RIP,</i>

6
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:16,940
<i>created a world
intricate as filigree.</i>

7
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:22,183
<i>And that is what I called it. Except
I was a bit drunk so... "Fillory."</i>

8
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:26,159
<i>Chock-stuffed with magic,
chatty animals, sexy creatures.</i>

9
00:00:26,226 --> 00:00:28,252
<i>Really, what a planet.</i>

10
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:31,560
<i>I calibrated everything for
maximum entertainment.</i>

11
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:34,761
<i>I decreed it be ruled
by Children of Earth,</i>

12
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:37,395
<i>a glum little planet known
for its plucky Magicians.</i>

13
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:40,964
<i>These brave souls would come, and
when they got boring, off they went.</i>

14
00:00:41,308 --> 00:00:45,245
<i>Case in point, Martin
Chatwin. Brave, clever boy.</i>

15
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,541
<i>Born hero.</i>

16
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:50,345
<i>Yet, honestly, very uncomfortable
to watch once he'd been molested.</i>

17
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:53,251
<i>So I made the difficult
decision to kick him out</i>

18
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,983
<i>and replace him with
someone more punchy and fun.</i>

19
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,390
<i>But Martin was more tenacious
than I gave him credit for.</i>

20
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,724
<i>He drank from the
Wellspring to get strong,</i>

21
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:03,923
<i>screwing Fillory in the process,</i>

22
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:06,023
<i>and set booby traps
for my brother and me.</i>

23
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:07,931
<i>And before you
know it, Umber's dead,</i>

24
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:11,403
<i>and I'm hiding in stupid Loria.</i>

25
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:13,633
I'm so fucking bored,
Children of Earth.

26
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:14,731
<i>Cut to...</i>

27
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:17,710
<i>Martin's mutated into a
terrible beast in a dapper suit.</i>

28
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:20,338
<i>Enter Quentin
Coldwater and his friends,</i>

29
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:25,478
<i>the Addict, the Victim, the
Bitch, the Scowl and the Martyr.</i>

30
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:28,989
<i>I bestowed my blessing and
they set out to kill The Beast.</i>

31
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:30,183
<i>Of course they failed.</i>

32
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,350
<i>Twist!</i>

33
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,020
<i>They have to start from
scratch with The Beast. Thrilling!</i>

34
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,895
<i>The danger of sublimated trauma
is a major theme in our story,</i>

35
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:39,934
<i>evidenced by Julia and Martin</i>

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,868
<i>teaming up to kill the
Earth god who violated her.</i>

37
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,962
<i>All very ambiguous and poignant,</i>

38
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:46,506
<i>I know!</i>

39
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:49,839
<i>Julia's partnership also threw a
massive wrench into Quentin's works.</i>

40
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,242
<i>Gut-wrenching!</i>

41
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:54,008
<i>I was forced to
intervene. Cameo!</i>

42
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:56,710
I have befouled the Wellspring.

43
00:01:56,917 --> 00:01:59,216
<i>Wasn't it tragic
when Alice died?</i>

44
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,812
<i>Wasn't it scary when
she became a Niffin?</i>

45
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:06,223
<i>The personal nature of her story
subverted Quentin's hero's journey nicely.</i>

46
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:08,455
<i>Character is destiny,
and, ultimately,</i>

47
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,326
<i>Quentin is a
Magician of intellect,</i>

48
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:14,027
<i>who nevertheless, and to his
detriment, acts from his heart.</i>

49
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:17,731
<i>But I did other things too, like
lead Quentin to that candy witch.</i>

50
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,170
<i>Don't worry, that'll pay off.</i>

51
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:21,504
<i>I hid the Wellspring
bowl in plain sight.</i>

52
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:23,407
<i>Made the Rainbow Bridge bloom.</i>

53
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,470
<i>Stole from the River Watcher so he'd be
good and angry when Penny stiffed him.</i>

54
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:29,106
<i>Oh, I know, good one.</i>

55
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:31,208
<i>It was I who caused
the High King's bride</i>

56
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:33,549
<i>to ovulate on the
right day, leading to...</i>

57
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,883
<i>Pregnant!</i>

58
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:36,595
<i>Ultimately leading to...</i>

59
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:38,534
<i>The Fairies can bring
back the Wellspring?</i>

60
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:39,558
<i>They can.</i>

61
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:40,753
<i>And in return?</i>

62
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,056
<i>A royal child of Whitespire.</i>

63
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:43,222
<i>Take her to the dungeon.</i>

64
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,288
<i>It will transport you
to the Fairy Realm.</i>

65
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,443
<i>I repeatedly broke
the filtration system,</i>

66
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,936
<i>so the Wellspring would
be unpredictable and fun.</i>

67
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,132
<i>All those pesky
"brown outs."</i> Moi!

68
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:55,402
<i>To be sure, The
Order is on to me.</i>

69
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,910
<i>They're in a panic about
the Great Blank Spot,</i>

70
00:02:57,978 --> 00:03:00,209
<i>surmising a fatal
hit to the Wellspring.</i>

71
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,182
<i>True, I am nearly
finished with Fillory.</i>

72
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,244
<i>Every chapter must end, and on
the eve of my benevolent destruction,</i>

73
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,754
<i>I'm getting it all
out of my system.</i>

74
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:13,385
<i>Like, causing sudden climate change that
kills entire tedious species of wildlife.</i>

75
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,429
<i>Turning people
into delicious rats.</i>

76
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,828
<i>All the babies this week
woke up with no mouths.</i>

77
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:18,922
<i>Oh, horrifying.</i>

78
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,661
<i>I bet you're wondering
what happens next.</i>

79
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,965
<i>And that is how I know
I've done my job well.</i>

80
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:27,201
<i>Sit back, have a nice pipe of
marijuana and enjoy my grand opus.</i>

81
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:30,438
<i>I call it Fillory's last gasp.</i>

82
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,744
I just miss the fire, okay?

83
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:17,988
Drink this.

84
00:04:21,194 --> 00:04:22,194
What is it?

85
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,061
Renders you unable
to harm your own body.

86
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,262
This is all pointless, Q.

87
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:35,707
You can't medicate me away...

88
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,642
Just fucking drink it.

89
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,283
All of it.

90
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,217
Ugh!

91
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:01,557
Why did you bring me back?

92
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:06,533
Why do you keep asking me that?

93
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:11,943
I watched you almost die
trying to bring your brother back.

94
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:14,277
You loved him. I love you.

95
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,312
I'd like to be alone now.

96
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,171
I take that to
mean I'm improving.

97
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,367
Well, your skin's healing.

98
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:45,378
Obviously your lungs
are, to use a technical term,

99
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:46,572
fucked,

100
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,874
but more importantly...
Just say it.

101
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:51,282
You have lesions on your spine.

102
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,785
And they're growing
aggressively.

103
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:54,412
Cancer.

104
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:56,055
Call it cancer-plus.

105
00:05:56,122 --> 00:06:00,321
Whatever you were exposed
to has spell residue all over it.

106
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,887
So a Magician did this?

107
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:05,891
Well, if so, it may be
a code we can crack.

108
00:06:06,967 --> 00:06:07,991
How long?

109
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:09,068
Well, it's hard to say,

110
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:10,713
but I have my entire
department working on it. I...

111
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:13,468
I mean, how long till I
die. If you don't crack it.

112
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,501
Two or three weeks.

113
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:18,135
But I promise you, we are
doing everything we can to just...

114
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,406
Okay...

115
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,471
Yeah, I'm not waiting
to die in a hospital bed.

116
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:23,073
Okay. I don't... I'm not!

117
00:06:26,453 --> 00:06:28,217
Can we talk, please? Yes.

118
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,194
Hey there, hot stuff.

119
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:46,034
No offense, you might
look as bad as I do.

120
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,408
I doubt that.

121
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,010
You're dying.

122
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,307
All I am is a little strung out.

123
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:56,641
Kady.

124
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,647
What? It's not about me.

125
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,914
What happened? Just tell me.

126
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:05,991
Reynard's gone.

127
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:10,629
I should be happy,

128
00:07:10,697 --> 00:07:13,223
but it wasn't how I wanted it.

129
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:15,831
It's not enough.

130
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:19,570
God, I feel like bashing
my head into a wall.

131
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,845
Why can't anything
just be fixed?

132
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:30,342
Life. I guess.

133
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,329
I don't want you to die.

134
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,491
'Course not. I'm the
best lay of your life.

135
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:49,126
Shut up.

136
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:52,500
What are we gonna do?

137
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,438
Wrap our minds around it.

138
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:57,972
Kady, let's not waste
time being mad, okay?

139
00:07:58,044 --> 00:07:59,740
I'm just gonna find
Quentin and Eliot.

140
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:02,408
Just gonna make a
couple pit stops first.

141
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:27,101
It's, um, a nice
sconce. Did you, um...

142
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,173
Spit it out.

143
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,606
You want something.

144
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,770
Yeah. First...

145
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,243
Are you okay?

146
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:43,349
I'm whole again.

147
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:47,458
Which is a good thing?

148
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,826
If by good you mean crying jags

149
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,229
and mountains of
guilt and panic attacks,

150
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:53,857
then, yeah, I'm
doing fucking great.

151
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,746
And since I better be getting
back to one of those soon,

152
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,739
whether I like it or not,
how can I help you?

153
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:02,071
Q says you have an amulet that
would make me invisible to a god.

154
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:30,134
Um, I don't pretend to understand
what you've been through,

155
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:35,401
but I can tell you the way you're relating
to that couch is not unknown to me.

156
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:37,808
Then you know I
want to be alone.

157
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:43,875
And, um, also that you
probably shouldn't be right now.

158
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:45,746
Why do you care?

159
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,412
I just do.

160
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,589
Come with me

161
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:55,458
and help me try to convince
Ember to let us keep Fillory.

162
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:56,888
Why?

163
00:09:56,963 --> 00:10:00,900
Because I have never met anyone
less willing to take no for an answer.

164
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,458
But I betrayed you, remember?

165
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,032
That was a long time ago.

166
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,608
I need help, and you do, too.

167
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:15,672
Let's kill a few birds.

168
00:10:15,748 --> 00:10:17,182
What do you say?

169
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,879
Wanna put some pants on
and help me save all of magic?

170
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,278
I'll go talk to
Eliot and Quentin.

171
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:50,843
Uh, Kady...

172
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:54,410
Just tell Penny that I went to
find a quiet place to do some dope.

173
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,718
I'm ready to leave when he is.

174
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:05,921
Look, here's the deal.

175
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:07,977
I just read your
book in the Library.

176
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,025
Both volumes.

177
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:11,931
My book? Why?

178
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,640
Because it ends the way
they all do in a couple days.

179
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,005
With 20 blank pages.

180
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:18,287
Something's about to happen.

181
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:19,655
Something magical,
and really fucking bad.

182
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,307
And I think it's... It's Ember.

183
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:23,646
He's been doing all sorts
of fucked up shit in Fillory.

184
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:25,275
"Bucket list" shit.

185
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,043
What's in my book?

186
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:28,177
You do your recon,

187
00:11:28,454 --> 00:11:30,889
find out Prince Ess of
Loria has taken Whitespire.

188
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:32,016
Shit.

189
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:35,061
Then kidnap Idri,
who I guess is a rat?

190
00:11:35,128 --> 00:11:36,858
Turn him back, then camp here

191
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,455
trying to find the perfect spell

192
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,411
to force Ember to keep
his mitts off of Fillory.

193
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,799
But if my book ends
then... Then... Exactly.

194
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,269
We know that doesn't work.

195
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:49,605
So you need to do anything else.
Anything. Pick a plan and commit.

196
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,777
If it's written,
isn't it written?

197
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:55,280
Yes. But I think
you can change it.

198
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:57,146
Okay, so we can save Fillory

199
00:11:57,217 --> 00:12:01,382
if we subscribe to a free-will
view of the universe, which is fair.

200
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:02,498
So what am I supposed to do?

201
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:06,323
Go. Get Idri. Hurry.

202
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:09,189
I just got one thing
I gotta button up.

203
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:14,296
Hey. I calculated
a portal to Tahiti.

204
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,126
Hold up.

205
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:19,935
No. You warned them.

206
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:22,441
You've done enough,
you get to be done.

207
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:23,852
I'm sorry. Believe
me, I'd rather...

208
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:25,504
No. None of it matters, Penny.

209
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,843
Oh, come on!

210
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,944
Penny, you're needed at once.

211
00:12:31,017 --> 00:12:34,181
I'm busy. Bit of an emergency,
we need our full staff.

212
00:12:34,354 --> 00:12:36,823
Are you crazy? He's dying.

213
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:39,051
Yes, because he went
into a restricted area,

214
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,993
which lethally poisoned him
and puts him on strict probation,

215
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,496
but most assuredly does not
mean he is excused from work.

216
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:46,364
We'll take every step
to keep him comfortable.

217
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:47,764
What the hell is wrong with you?

218
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:52,238
Kady, knowledge
itself is at stake.

219
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:54,672
That is more important
than any single one of us.

220
00:12:57,577 --> 00:12:59,239
I'll give you a moment
to say goodbye.

221
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:02,009
No. No. Not goodbye.

222
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:04,380
Kady, listen, I... No. I am
telling you, this isn't fair.

223
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:09,386
God damn it! Fuck.

224
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,239
Just crack the damn lock.

225
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:18,863
Hurry, before some
Fairy asshole sees us.

226
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,992
I'm going as fast as I can.

227
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:27,195
Fen, are you okay?

228
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:28,633
Sweetie, do you
know where you are?

229
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,538
A plane laid atop our own,

230
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:35,344
so, the Fairy Castle and Whitespire
actually occupy the same space and time,

231
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:38,544
but two dimensions, or
possibly the same dimension,

232
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:40,896
but incredibly sped up like that
one episode of <i>Star Trek</i> where...

233
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,320
Just get the damn chain, Josh.

234
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:43,583
No.

235
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:48,184
Not without my baby.
They took her away.

236
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,856
You have to come with us, okay?

237
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,695
Get the goddamn
shackles, Hoberman.

238
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:57,860
Grab her with me.
Come on. Come on.

239
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:03,204
There you are. The
Queen will see you now.

240
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:32,997
You've been making yourself quite
at home sneaking around my castle.

241
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:35,736
It's actually more
like my castle

242
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,505
that you guys have made
some weird AM radio version of.

243
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,812
What is it that you
seek, rude little Earth girl?

244
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,114
The woman and child you stole.

245
00:14:48,588 --> 00:14:49,817
You made a deal.

246
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:55,351
That deal was inhumane
bullshit, made under total duress.

247
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:00,462
Look, just tell me what
you want, okay, lady?

248
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,195
The child is mine.

249
00:15:04,771 --> 00:15:07,104
Now, onto the
business at hand...

250
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:08,869
No, the baby is the business.

251
00:15:08,941 --> 00:15:12,275
Ember is dangerously
bored of Fillory.

252
00:15:12,345 --> 00:15:17,648
You underestimated how
devastating it can be to displease a god.

253
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:21,977
We've been trying to get a
hold of Ember for months.

254
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:23,954
He ignores us.

255
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,754
Because you ask for things.

256
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:29,921
Offer something to him instead.

257
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,425
How do you know all this?

258
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:38,194
As it is in our shared interest
for your High King to succeed,

259
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,297
I'm inclined to let
you go help him.

260
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:41,432
Great.

261
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:44,375
Josh, Fen, the baby
and I will go right now.

262
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,073
You know it doesn't
work that way.

263
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,345
Now, are you familiar with this?

264
00:15:51,751 --> 00:15:52,810
No...

265
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,319
Fucking goddamn...

266
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:55,548
Smells good.

267
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,590
Even better to a god.

268
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:59,683
It will draw Ember.

269
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,227
Take it, bake it into...

270
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:06,164
I know this one. Little cakes.

271
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:08,565
He loves little cakes.

272
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:09,768
Okay.

273
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,329
Point the way back.

274
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:14,203
Certainly.

275
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:17,368
As soon as I've
exacted the toll.

276
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:22,072
Travel from this world costs,
dear. I don't make the rules.

277
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:25,880
Oh, that's right. Yes, I do.

278
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,854
We'll be seeing each
other soon, I suspect.

279
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:41,057
So, how is Alice?

280
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:43,461
Okay, Eliot, I... We
need your help, Q.

281
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:48,637
You gave her the no-secret-cutting
shit from the keg, right?

282
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,973
Yes, physically
she's perfectly safe.

283
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:53,239
But mentally...

284
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,314
What am I supposed to do?

285
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:12,757
You know what you learn
when you're a High King?

286
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,235
Screwing up is inevitable.

287
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:21,365
And there are some
fuckups you can never unfuck.

288
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,875
It's infuriating and it's
heartbreaking, but...

289
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:25,912
I think I destroyed her, Eliot.

290
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:28,447
She made plenty of her
own choices along the way.

291
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:29,880
I'm not saying it doesn't suck.

292
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:33,943
I'm saying, Fillory needs you.

293
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,854
You chose to be a king.
This is what that means.

294
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:42,756
We have a plan,

295
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:47,893
but we need someone
who speaks fluent fanboy.

296
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:59,003
What on Earth are you
doing here, sad little nerd king?

297
00:18:02,782 --> 00:18:04,614
You're sitting in
my chair, asshole.

298
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:05,961
Where the hell are the guards?

299
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:07,146
Fast asleep, sorry.

300
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:09,188
Watch where you
point that thing.

301
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:12,453
Dad, you're okay.

302
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:15,791
I had to do this.
You were a rat...

303
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:17,090
Can I have my throne back now?

304
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,858
I'll fight if you want. I've become
pretty boss with a broadsword.

305
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,461
You have, so don't.

306
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:26,764
Fine.

307
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,376
Always did like to storm out.

308
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:38,282
I should go, too.

309
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:41,014
I should be there for my
people, whatever happens.

310
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,383
You mean, in case I fail?

311
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:43,787
You won't.

312
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:49,888
You know, since
Ember banished me,

313
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:54,423
I wonder if that nullified
my whole Fillorian contract.

314
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:01,998
We could check.

315
00:19:16,122 --> 00:19:20,753
Okay, so the thing is, this, um,
Blank Spot, it's coming up fast.

316
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,294
And it lines up with everything

317
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:23,886
that you were
saying about Ember.

318
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,361
Is this tree too asymmetrical?

319
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:28,659
It's nice. I...

320
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:34,631
So, there's no way that you
would want to help us, like, at all?

321
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:40,471
One cannot just show up after
one's faked one's own death.

322
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:43,340
I'm sorry.

323
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:46,278
The end of Fillory
makes me sad as well.

324
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,378
So Fillory really is done?

325
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:53,389
I like you. You
care about things.

326
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,988
Yeah, it's not really a
trait that's helped me much.

327
00:19:57,063 --> 00:19:58,190
But it could be,

328
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:00,631
if it were applied to not
trying to fix the unfixable,

329
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:05,138
but rather something
fresh and more perfect.

330
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,271
Like, say...

331
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,872
Care to take a visit?
Make some notes?

332
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:16,541
Um, I, uh...

333
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:19,676
I'm sorry, but you're
acting like I'm asking you,

334
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:22,119
whereas I am a god and
you're a hairless monkey,

335
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:25,249
so nod and say thank you.

336
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:26,348
All right!

337
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:30,086
Let's go to the pocket world
formerly known as Cuba!

338
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:46,970
Whoa.

339
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,781
Coming back from the Fairy world

340
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:52,216
was a little rockier
than getting there.

341
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,150
You don't fucking say.

342
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:56,519
Are you okay?

343
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,093
Jesus.

344
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:06,060
Fen wouldn't come because
they have your daughter.

345
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,699
I'm sorry.

346
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:13,396
I'll keep trying. I promise, El.

347
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,608
First, we need to deal
with that cock Ember.

348
00:21:17,676 --> 00:21:19,668
We come bearing bait.

349
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:27,314
I look like Jack Sparrow if
he were played by a man.

350
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:31,448
I was actually thinking
more like a Fembot Nick Fury.

351
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:37,429
Look... No, I need to...

352
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:39,624
I know. Okay?

353
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,030
I was angry.

354
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,400
And scared of what
you were capable of.

355
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,304
But you were doing your
best in an impossible position

356
00:21:47,373 --> 00:21:50,002
that would have crushed
anyone, myself included.

357
00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:52,837
Wait, is your good
eye crying right now?

358
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:55,441
No...

359
00:21:55,514 --> 00:21:57,540
Yes.

360
00:21:57,616 --> 00:22:00,245
And it's not my good eye.
It's my only fucking eye.

361
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:05,254
It's not funny, you
dick. I'm a cyclops.

362
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:09,659
A mythological monster
at last. Box checked.

363
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:12,897
We're trying too hard.

364
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:13,965
Pardon?

365
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:18,035
To just blow past and banter.

366
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:24,900
It's not the same. Let's
not pretend it is, okay?

367
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:29,577
That makes it hurt worse.

368
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:33,915
I guess we'll just have to live with
the strain till the future reveals itself.

369
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:40,349
Meantime, that future's gonna be
a big, blank, post-apocalyptic nada

370
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:42,361
unless we do what we do best.

371
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:46,627
Act out with a total lack of
empathy and impulse control?

372
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:49,061
Party like the
world depends on it.

373
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:53,267
'Cause, Bambi-One-Eye, it do.

374
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:16,457
Oh, my God.

375
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:18,429
I threw better orgies
when I was 10.

376
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:20,693
I give you little cakes.

377
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:26,201
I know they're irresistible.
It's the candied Fairy hemp.

378
00:23:26,272 --> 00:23:29,504
But resist. This is
for our guest of honor.

379
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:52,829
Be brutal.

380
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:57,096
It's really...

381
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:59,333
It's really linear.

382
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:21,793
How's the linguini?

383
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:41,577
There's nothing wrong with it.

384
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:44,708
Excellent. That's excellent.

385
00:24:46,352 --> 00:24:47,615
It's maybe a little, uh...

386
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,444
Chewy?

387
00:24:49,722 --> 00:24:50,722
Bland.

388
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:53,020
Bland "good"? Or...

389
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:54,822
Bland is never
really good or bad.

390
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:56,122
It appeals to all tastes.

391
00:24:56,195 --> 00:24:57,288
Sure.

392
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:04,565
But usually people, uh... Creatures
who can think, gods, even...

393
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:06,127
They sometimes like the unknown,

394
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:08,674
the unexpected,
even the offensive.

395
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:11,702
Little bit of, uh...

396
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:21,579
Chaos.

397
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,729
Happy now?

398
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:41,596
You know who'd love this?

399
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:46,111
Who'd create an entire
world out of this greasy stain?

400
00:25:47,513 --> 00:25:48,606
My brother.

401
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,672
Yes, Ember would make a mess...

402
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:53,116
Do not speak to me of Ember!

403
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:59,089
I like you, boy, but
I have a temper.

404
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:01,818
Wait, what about
a human sacrifice?

405
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:04,625
No! Unless the cakes are bad.

406
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:07,042
Well, they smell great, but I
don't think they're working, so...

407
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,763
Little cakes.

408
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,360
Mmm. Oh!

409
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:15,036
Mmm. Oh, oh.

410
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:16,707
Oh, yes.

411
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,709
Welcome, Ember, God of Gods.

412
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:24,614
Wait, didn't I banish you?

413
00:26:24,683 --> 00:26:25,981
You did, Lord of All, but...

414
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:27,611
I didn't expect
this... I can explain...

415
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:30,213
I love it.

416
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,687
A genuine twist,
a true surprise.

417
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,727
When was the last time
that happened around here?

418
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:37,319
Exactly, and we're
really sorry about that.

419
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:40,833
We've fallen down on the
job, but boredom is death,

420
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:41,899
I totally agree.

421
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:44,129
Isn't it, though? It is.

422
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:50,472
But we can make Fillory more
exciting and watchable than ever.

423
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:51,542
That's our pitch.

424
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,579
It's a new chapter,
and the title is,

425
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:56,444
"Shit Tons of
Drama and Surprise."

426
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:58,484
Intriguing.

427
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:01,986
How?

428
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:03,784
Don't destroy Fillory.

429
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:05,586
Shake things up, yes.

430
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:06,716
Like the rats.

431
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,470
Yeah. The rats were hilarious.

432
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:09,757
It was good, wasn't it?

433
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:11,990
We're all still laughing. Right?

434
00:27:12,064 --> 00:27:13,396
Mmm-hmm. Laughing?

435
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:20,238
There's so much more to do here.

436
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:23,798
So many twists and surprises
this world can offer. Mmm.

437
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:27,711
Think back to the moment you
created the first blades of grass.

438
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:28,872
Sentient trees.

439
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:30,040
Talking animals.

440
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:31,115
The Wellspring.

441
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:34,517
Think back to what you
built with your brother Umber.

442
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:37,055
My brother, rest his soul,

443
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:40,490
was nothing but a simpering,
sniping, anal retentive critic.

444
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:41,618
As well as a...

445
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:48,497
Greedy, promiscuous, selfish,
credit-hogging, mouse-eating slob.

446
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:50,092
Any talk of this is mere whimsy.

447
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,380
And it is whimsy itself that I
am tired of and finished with.

448
00:27:52,404 --> 00:27:53,770
We get it, we do.

449
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,434
I mean, try ruling a world
of whimsy, am I right?

450
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,500
Mmm. Not so whimsical, actually.

451
00:27:58,577 --> 00:28:00,808
Well, then, let's
get it over with.

452
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:03,781
Why wait? Let's start right now.

453
00:28:04,116 --> 00:28:06,051
No, no, no.

454
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:09,247
Okay, wait a minute.
Rewind, rewind, rewind.

455
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:15,957
Stop! Are you
insane, you can't...

456
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,587
Margo! I mean, we meant,

457
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:18,926
make it better, make it better.

458
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:21,592
Less whimsical! More
meaner maybe, more you.

459
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:23,636
Maybe. If I didn't
have to do it alone.

460
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:26,401
Say what you will about
my dear departed brother,

461
00:28:26,471 --> 00:28:28,838
but he was a demon for overwork.

462
00:28:28,907 --> 00:28:30,185
Hmm. He had a
strange love for this...

463
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:32,576
Poor accursed place.

464
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:35,876
Too late to be helped now.
I couldn't bear to go back.

465
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:38,076
I won't. I won't.

466
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,551
Um, actually,
we're already there.

467
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:42,110
Where?

468
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:46,090
Apocalypse,
apocalypse, apocalypse!

469
00:28:46,158 --> 00:28:47,649
Isn't it wonderful?

470
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:54,826
What are you doing?
You're making a mess!

471
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:07,645
I'm back?

472
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:09,440
You're alive.

473
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:14,814
How is this possible, brother?

474
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:19,185
You died battling
Martin to save me.

475
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,158
Why are you afraid?

476
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:27,324
I am so pleased.

477
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:34,403
Martin told me you died...

478
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:37,539
When he banished me.

479
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,601
Hey, guys. How about a hug?

480
00:29:39,678 --> 00:29:41,271
This is a family reunion.

481
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:43,008
This was a family betrayal.

482
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:45,149
Wasn't it?

483
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:47,351
Wasn't it?

484
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:48,819
No!

485
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:52,750
No! I can't be here.

486
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:58,120
Oh! All this time, I
thought Martin so powerful.

487
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:01,230
But, no.

488
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,464
He was merely a
brilliant dealmaker.

489
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:10,571
My banishment for your life.

490
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:15,876
Your puny, petty, putrid,

491
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:18,007
nothing of a soul spark.

492
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,683
Please.

493
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:28,116
Please!

494
00:30:28,193 --> 00:30:32,028
You always were the weak one.

495
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:54,079
Come and get me,
you fucking baby.

496
00:30:56,054 --> 00:30:57,454
You wanna know
why you're so bored?

497
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,390
Because you're
too stupid to get it,

498
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:03,293
you're too spoiled and
entitled to understand...

499
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:06,298
How dare you? I am a god.

500
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:08,857
Are you? Really?

501
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:10,732
I'm not impressed.

502
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:13,431
I've met scary gods. And you?

503
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:16,434
You're nothing
but a petty tyrant.

504
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,848
Quentin?

505
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,047
You always surprise.

506
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,903
Holy fuck.

507
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:51,008
Q?

508
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:55,637
I think you just saved
the whole world.

509
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:13,065
We are officially a land
of godless heathens,

510
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:16,829
making today the first day
of our societal adulthood.

511
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:21,231
I, for one, am slightly
terrified and equally excited.

512
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:23,002
And trying not to
break into <i>Hamilton.</i>

513
00:32:23,475 --> 00:32:27,879
And so I turn over the next phase of
our maturation to our High Queen Margo.

514
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:30,147
We need a constitution.

515
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:31,649
Pardon?

516
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:35,682
These are some pretty good ones
here so let's rip off the best parts.

517
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:48,828
Hungry?

518
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:54,029
I know Mayakovsky said
soft bland food for a while,

519
00:32:56,441 --> 00:33:00,071
but I can see that's
not really working.

520
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:02,910
So I stopped by the farm

521
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:07,077
where Fogg gets his
weekly rasher of bacon.

522
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:08,881
No, thanks.

523
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:10,081
You sure?

524
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:14,984
Because I tried it

525
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:19,794
and, uh, it's amazing.

526
00:33:22,634 --> 00:33:24,967
I know what you're trying to do.

527
00:33:26,872 --> 00:33:29,933
I'm just trying to do
breakfast food. That's all.

528
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:39,011
Oh, fuck you.

529
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,013
Mmm.

530
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,581
Please.

531
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:52,689
Fuck.

532
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:54,528
Gluttony.

533
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:57,829
It's an excellent
part of being human.

534
00:34:00,105 --> 00:34:02,301
I don't remember many others.

535
00:34:02,641 --> 00:34:03,836
Really?

536
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:07,770
Ugh.

537
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:13,241
Hmm, my hands are all greasy.

538
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:15,012
Ugh.

539
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,855
With every good thing
no matter how small it is,

540
00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:24,152
it's always married to something
so completely disgusting.

541
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:27,228
You can't escape it.

542
00:34:27,832 --> 00:34:31,928
You're right. It's
gross. We are animals.

543
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:52,387
Why does that feel so good?

544
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,661
I don't know.

545
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:02,901
It just does.

546
00:35:05,003 --> 00:35:06,596
And always did.

547
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:46,568
Look, I need your help.

548
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:09,999
I'm not gonna beg.

549
00:36:10,068 --> 00:36:12,003
I'm not gonna use
guilt. I have no leverage.

550
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:15,598
But Penny is in the Library.
He can be your mole.

551
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:17,870
But to do that, he'd
have to be alive.

552
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:25,517
He'd never know.

553
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:29,816
Whatever you need, ask me
about it. He tells me, I tell you.

554
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:38,127
Who saved her man's life, so
maybe not. Big picture, right?

555
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:41,298
Deal?

556
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,128
Deal.

557
00:36:48,173 --> 00:36:51,701
You know, I probably
shouldn't say this out loud, but...

558
00:36:53,912 --> 00:36:55,904
This was kind of an okay day.

559
00:36:57,749 --> 00:36:59,377
Are you bragging?

560
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:00,677
No...

561
00:37:03,288 --> 00:37:05,052
Kind of.

562
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:06,819
Not about this.

563
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,257
Entirely.

564
00:37:11,196 --> 00:37:13,427
I also kind of killed a god.

565
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:17,800
Huh. Hilarious.

566
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:20,601
No. Serious.

567
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:23,536
Ember...

568
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:30,608
I mean, he was
erasing the whole thing.

569
00:37:30,682 --> 00:37:32,776
Wait, you can't be serious.

570
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:34,342
Yeah.

571
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:36,650
No, no, no.

572
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:37,780
No, I didn't want to.

573
00:37:37,856 --> 00:37:40,155
He just killed his brother,
he was going after Julia.

574
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:42,285
He was genocidally insane...

575
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,226
You don't get it.

576
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:46,061
Jesus.

577
00:37:46,131 --> 00:37:48,259
When I was a Niffin,
I... I saw things.

578
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:50,131
I saw everything from
the beginning of time.

579
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:51,294
Alice, calm down.

580
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:53,770
No. I understand the
way the universe works, Q.

581
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:57,240
The Wellspring, the
hierarchies, the plumbing.

582
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:59,743
I was inside it.

583
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:02,542
Gods like Ember
have parents, you idiot.

584
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:05,380
I'm not following.

585
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:06,543
The Old Gods.

586
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:09,611
The creators of the
universe, of all magic itself.

587
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:12,088
<i>To Ember, we're like toys,</i>

588
00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:14,524
<i>but to the them we're cells.</i>

589
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:15,992
When we're harmless,
they ignore us.

590
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:18,895
But when we become
malignant, they amputate.

591
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,641
Now, if you're gonna
use stones like this.

592
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:22,156
It's imperative that...

593
00:38:23,368 --> 00:38:27,669
Excuse me. Excuse me. This...

594
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:29,600
<i>Okay. Wait.</i>

595
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:34,169
There's an actual plumber, like
the Mario Brother of the gods?

596
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:35,269
Yes.

597
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:37,542
And he can just... I
guarantee you, he's doing it.

598
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:48,569
FEMALE AUTOMATED
VOICE: <i>Attention.</i>

599
00:38:48,593 --> 00:38:52,030
<i>Please keep calm and
follow all code procedures.</i>

600
00:38:52,096 --> 00:38:53,496
<i>Please remember not to interact</i>

601
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:56,262
<i>and safely gather all the
things as you cautiously exit.</i>

602
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:01,137
<i>Attention. Please
keep calm and follow...</i>

603
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:20,451
Professor!

604
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:21,891
Mayakovsky!

605
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,464
Holy shit.

606
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:43,343
All right, everyone. Open
your books to Chapter 16.

607
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:08,768
Who can translate the Borkulo
Rendering from its original Hungarian?

608
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:13,333
No point in raising
hands. Remember?

609
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:16,771
I can.

610
00:40:16,848 --> 00:40:18,976
Dean Fogg? Sorry to interrupt...

611
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,814
Yes, Josh. Go ahead.

612
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:22,499
Well, I was online last night...

613
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:24,146
And the answer is no.

614
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:31,154
There is no actual evidence of a
magical surge in Sedona, Arizona.

615
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:35,894
Yeah, but what about... Or
Kenya or Machu Picchu or China.

616
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:39,164
Or anywhere.

617
00:40:41,706 --> 00:40:43,231
Magic is gone.

618
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:46,276
The best we can
do is accept that

619
00:40:46,344 --> 00:40:50,839
and continue our theoretical
studies to stay ready for its return.

620
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,578
So you think that's possible.

621
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:55,586
Anything is possible, Alice.

622
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,520
Was, anyway.

623
00:41:01,492 --> 00:41:03,290
Look at you.

624
00:41:03,361 --> 00:41:06,490
Playing the part of
the bright young girl.

625
00:41:07,065 --> 00:41:08,328
Joseph?

626
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:12,035
Ah, yes.

627
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:15,162
I can see my
Alice in there still.

628
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:16,932
Good.

629
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:20,844
Are you all right?

630
00:41:20,912 --> 00:41:23,575
I am as I appear. Dying.

631
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:28,378
So, it is true? Magic's
gone everywhere.

632
00:41:28,453 --> 00:41:33,482
The creatures, cryptids,
sylphs, dragons, unicorns,

633
00:41:33,558 --> 00:41:36,722
even the pointless
vampires are all as they were.

634
00:41:37,762 --> 00:41:41,824
But those of us who drew on
the power of the Wellspring...

635
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:44,795
Well, as you can see.

636
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:45,869
I want to help.

637
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:48,873
I'm here, Alice, because
it is you who needs help.

638
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,999
What?

639
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:52,737
As a Niffin, you made enemies.

640
00:41:53,144 --> 00:41:56,012
I'm here to warn you that
one of them seeks you.

641
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,104
Who?

642
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,274
The Lamprey.

643
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,217
You do recall what
you did to his family?

644
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:03,711
Yes.

645
00:42:03,788 --> 00:42:05,313
Most amusing at the time.

646
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:09,157
But to The Lamprey,
cause for vengeance.

647
00:42:09,227 --> 00:42:12,356
It knows you're weak.
It knows you're here.

648
00:42:17,168 --> 00:42:18,363
What...

649
00:42:25,176 --> 00:42:28,635
Democracy has
to take a backseat.

650
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:32,582
Without magic, the
people are terrified.

651
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:35,210
And that is just one
step from an angry mob...

652
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:37,380
And that's how royal
heads end up in baskets.

653
00:42:37,455 --> 00:42:39,424
I get it. I get it.

654
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:45,691
This is an undereducated,
pre-industrial populace, Eliot.

655
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:47,322
They need to be ruled.

656
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,594
They need to be inspired.

657
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:54,764
They need to think they're being
inspired, as they're being ruled.

658
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:58,833
I'm talking curfew,
martial law, conscription

659
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:00,538
and severe and
public punishment.

660
00:43:00,611 --> 00:43:04,912
Okay, can we maybe make our way
to King and Queen Caligula, please?

661
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:05,982
Maybe, uh...

662
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:08,645
How do you not recognize
me? I'm the king's wife, tell them.

663
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:09,812
Oh, my God.

664
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:16,652
Are you okay? Yes.

665
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:18,525
How did you get here?

666
00:43:19,464 --> 00:43:22,832
Simple. I just
gave them my toes.

667
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,529
Gave who your toes?

668
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:26,934
The Fairies.

669
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,866
I wanted to stay,

670
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:34,470
to be close to our daughter,
but I had to warn you.

671
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:36,707
They're coming.

672
00:43:38,683 --> 00:43:39,742
They're here.

673
00:44:23,961 --> 00:44:25,020
Boo.

674
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:27,456
Hey.

675
00:44:27,532 --> 00:44:28,591
Hey.

676
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,032
Jules, I...

677
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:31,964
Hi.

678
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:35,807
How did you get in here?

679
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:38,907
Well, your fence
is a little shoddy.

680
00:44:39,911 --> 00:44:41,072
Right.

681
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,615
Welcome to the new normal.

682
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,777
You know, 'cause I killed
all magic fucking everywhere.

683
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:53,182
Sorry, that was
definitely a two-hander,

684
00:44:53,758 --> 00:44:55,784
I'll be burning in
hell right next to you.

685
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,159
But, hey, at least
we have each other.

686
00:44:58,229 --> 00:44:59,288
Hmm.

687
00:45:01,232 --> 00:45:02,996
So, how are you?

688
00:45:04,302 --> 00:45:05,770
Fine.

689
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:08,032
Listen... How's law school?

690
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,164
I quit.

691
00:45:10,508 --> 00:45:12,977
Okay. Why?

692
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:18,281
Because I need to
show you something.

693
00:45:19,984 --> 00:45:23,386
And you need to promise me
that you're not going to tell anyone.

694
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:26,252
'Cause you're the
only person that I trust.

695
00:45:28,826 --> 00:45:30,158
I promise.

696
00:45:36,334 --> 00:45:37,529
Jules, it's not gonna work.

697
00:45:37,602 --> 00:45:40,162
Just gimme a second.

698
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:43,106
We all get flashes that
we can do it again, but it's...

699
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:46,738
Oh, my God.

700
00:45:47,612 --> 00:45:48,612
How?

701
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:51,839
I have no idea.
