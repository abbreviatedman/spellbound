1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:01,495
.

2
00:00:01,535 --> 00:00:02,295
- Hello,
glorious audience.

3
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,407
It is I, Ember,
god of Fillory.

4
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:07,609
Feel free to bow and grovel.
I'll wait.

5
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:10,041
Oh, but I've got
so much to tell you.

6
00:00:10,078 --> 00:00:13,208
I, with minor help
from my brother Umber--R.I.P.--

7
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:16,547
created a world
intricate as filigree,

8
00:00:16,584 --> 00:00:19,054
and that is what I called it,

9
00:00:19,087 --> 00:00:22,117
except I was a bit drunk,
so...Fillory.

10
00:00:22,156 --> 00:00:23,786
Chock stuffed with magic,

11
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:25,094
chatty animals,

12
00:00:25,126 --> 00:00:26,126
sexy creatures.

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,200
Really, what a planet.

14
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:31,399
I calibrated everything
for maximum entertainment.

15
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:34,572
I decreed it be ruled
by children of Earth,

16
00:00:34,602 --> 00:00:37,342
a glum little planet
known for its plucky magicians.

17
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,311
These brave souls would come,

18
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,240
and when they got boring,
off they went.

19
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:43,435
Case in point,
Martin Chatwin.

20
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:46,147
Brave, clever boy,
born hero,

21
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,850
yet honestly,
very uncomfortable to watch

22
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,322
once he'd been molested.

23
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:52,321
So, I made
the difficult decision

24
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:53,593
to kick him out
and replace him

25
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:56,091
with someone
more punchy and fun,

26
00:00:56,124 --> 00:00:59,334
but Martin was more tenacious
than I gave him credit for.

27
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,500
He drank from the Wellspring
to get strong,

28
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:03,559
screwing Fillory
in the process,

29
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:05,667
and set booby traps
for my brother and me,

30
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:07,469
and before you know it,
Umber's dead

31
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:11,111
and I'm hiding
in stupid Loria.

32
00:01:11,139 --> 00:01:13,569
I'm so fucking bored,
children of Earth.

33
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,307
Cut to--
Martin's mutated

34
00:01:15,343 --> 00:01:17,453
into a terrible beast
in a dapper suit.

35
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:20,308
Enter Quentin Coldwater
and his friends--

36
00:01:20,348 --> 00:01:22,118
the Addict, the Victim,

37
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,680
the Bitch, the Scowl,

38
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:25,317
and the Martyr.

39
00:01:25,353 --> 00:01:26,623
I bestowed my blessing,

40
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:28,694
and they set out
to kill The Beast.

41
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:30,262
Of course, they failed.

42
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:32,331
Twist!
They had to start from scratch

43
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,260
with The Beast.
Thrilling.

44
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:37,625
The danger of sublimated trauma
is a major theme in our story,

45
00:01:37,665 --> 00:01:40,195
evidenced by Julia and Martin
teaming up

46
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:42,504
to kill the Earth god
who violated her.

47
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:46,206
All very ambiguous
and poignant--I know!

48
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,580
Julia's partnership
also threw a massive wrench

49
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:51,209
into Quentin's works.
Gut-wrenching!

50
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:53,575
I was forced to intervene.
Cameo!

51
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,484
I have the befouled
the Wellspring.

52
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:59,387
Wasn't it tragic
when Alice died?

53
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,490
Wasn't it scary
when she became a niffin?

54
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:03,392
The personal nature
of her story

55
00:02:03,424 --> 00:02:06,234
subverted Quentin's
hero's journey nicely.

56
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,360
Character is destiny
and, ultimately,

57
00:02:08,396 --> 00:02:11,266
Quentin is a Magician
of intellect who nevertheless,

58
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:13,699
and to his detriment,
acts from his heart.

59
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:15,404
But I did other things too!

60
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:17,506
Like lead Quentin
to that Candy Witch.

61
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:19,208
Don't worry,
that'll pay off.

62
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,380
I hid the Wellspring ball
in plain sight,

63
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:23,379
made the Rainbow Bridge bloom,

64
00:02:23,411 --> 00:02:25,251
stole from the River Watcher

65
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:27,249
so he'd be good and angry
when Penny stiffed him.

66
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:28,921
Oh, I know, good one.

67
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:30,619
It was I who caused
the High King's bride

68
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,651
to ovulate on the right day,
leading to--

69
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:34,687
- Preg-nant!

70
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:36,662
- Ultimately leading to--

71
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,660
[falsetto] The fairies can
bring back the Wellspring?

72
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,362
- They can.
- [falsetto] And in return?

73
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:41,604
- A royal child of Whitespire.

74
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:43,359
Take her to the dungeon.

75
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:45,267
- He will transport you
to the fairy realm.

76
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,239
- I repeatedly broke
the filtration system

77
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:49,698
so the Wellspring would be
unpredictable and fun.

78
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:53,207
All those pesky "brownouts"?
Moi!

79
00:02:53,241 --> 00:02:55,411
To be sure,
the Order is on to me.

80
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:57,583
They're in a panic
about the Great Blank Spot,

81
00:02:57,611 --> 00:03:00,281
surmising a fatal hit
to the Wellspring.

82
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:02,984
True, I am nearly finished
with Fillory.

83
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,146
Every chapter must end,

84
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,294
and on the eve
of my benevolent destruction

85
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:08,591
I'm getting it all
out of my system.

86
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:10,622
Like causing
sudden climate change

87
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:13,428
that kills entire
tedious species of wildlife,

88
00:03:13,461 --> 00:03:15,401
turning people
into delicious rats.

89
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:17,399
All the babies this week
woke up with no mouths.

90
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:19,001
Oh, horrifying!
- [screams]

91
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,202
- I bet you're wondering
what happens next,

92
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:22,704
and that is how I know
I've done my job well.

93
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:25,506
Sit back, have a nice pipe
of marijuana,

94
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,279
and enjoy my grand opus.

95
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:30,438
I call it
Fillory's Last Gasp.

96
00:03:46,694 --> 00:03:48,764
[wind howling]

97
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:13,491
- I just miss the fire, okay?

98
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,730
- Drink this.

99
00:04:20,528 --> 00:04:22,428
- What is it?

100
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:24,803
- Renders you unable to harm
your own body.

101
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:32,413
- [whispers]
This is all pointless, Q.

102
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:35,581
You can't medicate me away.

103
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,279
- Just fucking drink it.

104
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,818
All of it.

105
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,290
- [burps]
Ugh.

106
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:01,497
Why did you bring me back?

107
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,811
- Why do you keep
asking me that?

108
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,740
I--[scoffs]

109
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:11,676
I watched you almost die trying
to bring your brother back.

110
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,752
You loved him.
I love you.

111
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:17,321
[scoffs]

112
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:21,863
- I'd like to be alone now.

113
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:26,634
[somber music]

114
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:31,370
*

115
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:34,569
- [coughing]

116
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:39,839
I take that to mean
I'm improving.

117
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:41,143
- Well, your skin's healing.

118
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,384
Obviously, your lungs are,

119
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:46,451
to use a technical term,
fucked,

120
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,680
but more importantly...

121
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:49,615
- Just say it.

122
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,820
- You have lesions
on your spine,

123
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,151
and they're growing
aggressively.

124
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,146
- Cancer.

125
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,887
- Call it cancer plus.

126
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:59,963
- Whatever you were exposed to
has spell residue all over it.

127
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:01,633
- So a magician did this?

128
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:06,632
- Well, if so, it may be
a code we can crack.

129
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:07,797
- How long?

130
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:08,895
- Well, it's hard to say,
but I have

131
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:10,696
my entire department
working on it--

132
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:13,138
- I mean how long till I die
if you don't crack it?

133
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:15,443
- Two or three weeks.

134
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:17,906
But I promise you, we are doing
everything we can to--

135
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:19,575
- Yeah. [grunts]
- Okay--

136
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:21,483
- I'm not waiting to die
in a hospital bed.

137
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:23,515
- Okay, I don't think--
- I'm not!

138
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:26,145
[groans]

139
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:27,756
- Can we talk please?
- Yes.

140
00:06:27,788 --> 00:06:29,818
- [scoffs]

141
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:31,887
[grunts]

142
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:40,932
- Hey, there, hot stuff.

143
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:46,507
- No offense--you might look
as bad as I do.

144
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,480
- I doubt that.

145
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,910
You're dying.

146
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:55,015
All I am is
a little strung out.

147
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:56,748
- Kady...

148
00:06:56,784 --> 00:06:58,524
- What? It's not about me.

149
00:06:58,552 --> 00:06:59,852
- What happened?

150
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:01,917
Tell me.

151
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,887
- Reynard's gone.

152
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:10,525
I should be happy, but...

153
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:13,874
it wasn't how I wanted it.

154
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:16,801
It's not enough.

155
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:19,467
God, I feel like bashing
my head into a wall.

156
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:21,537
[sniffs, groans]

157
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:27,817
Why can't anything
just be fixed?

158
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:29,818
- Life, I guess.

159
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,820
[soft music]

160
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:34,763
*

161
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,458
- [sniffs]

162
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,930
I don't want you to die.

163
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,274
- Of course not.

164
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,828
I'm the best lay
of your life.

165
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:48,737
- [laughs] Shut up.

166
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:52,241
What are we gonna do?

167
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:54,582
- Wrap our minds around it.

168
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:57,748
Kady, let's not waste time
being mad, okay?

169
00:07:57,778 --> 00:07:59,248
I'm just gonna find
Quentin and Eliot,

170
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,649
just gonna make
a couple pit stops first.

171
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:06,493
[distant horns honk]
[sirens wail]

172
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:10,489
- [sniffs]

173
00:08:12,693 --> 00:08:15,763
[door opens and closes]

174
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,610
- That's, um...
a nice sconce.

175
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,909
Did you, um--
- Spit it out.

176
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,950
You want something.

177
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,549
- Yeah.

178
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:35,051
First...

179
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:37,992
[exhales]

180
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,948
Are you okay?

181
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:43,962
- I'm whole again.

182
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:45,891
- W--

183
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:47,126
which is a--a good thing.

184
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,760
- If by good
you mean crying jags

185
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:52,027
and mountains of guilt
and panic attacks,

186
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:54,095
then, yeah,
I'm doing fucking great.

187
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:56,344
And since I better be getting
back to one of them soon,

188
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,609
whether I like it or not,
how can I help you?

189
00:08:58,639 --> 00:08:59,839
- Q says you have an amulet

190
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,983
that would make me
invisible to a god.

191
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:16,692
- [groans]

192
00:09:17,991 --> 00:09:18,961
[overlapping sounds]

193
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:20,362
[sighs]

194
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,633
[sobs]

195
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:28,595
- Um, I don't pretend
to understand

196
00:09:28,636 --> 00:09:30,066
what you've been through,

197
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:31,913
but I can tell you

198
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:33,669
the way you're relating
to that couch

199
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:35,137
is not unknown to me.

200
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:37,705
- Then you know
I want to be alone.

201
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:44,345
- And, um, also that you
probably shouldn't be right now.

202
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:45,694
- Why do you care?

203
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:48,059
- I...just do.

204
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,193
Come with me....

205
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:55,795
and help me try to convince
Ember to let us keep Fillory.

206
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:57,999
- Why?
- Because I have never met

207
00:09:58,031 --> 00:10:00,801
anyone less willing to take
no for an answer.

208
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:02,174
- But I betrayed you,
remember?

209
00:10:02,202 --> 00:10:05,842
- [inhales deeply]

210
00:10:05,873 --> 00:10:09,083
That was a long time ago.

211
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:13,849
[clears throat]
I need help, and you do too.

212
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:16,121
Let's kill a few birds.

213
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:17,849
What do you say?
Wanna put some pants on

214
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:19,845
and help me save
all of magic?

215
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:24,892
[ethereal music]

216
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:31,965
*

217
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:46,177
- I'll go talk to Eliot
and Quentin.

218
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:51,122
- Uh, Kady--
- Just tell Penny

219
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:54,091
that I went to find
a quiet place and do some dope.

220
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:57,161
I'm ready to leave
when he is.

221
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,930
- Look...here's the deal.

222
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:09,136
I just read your book
in the library, both volumes.

223
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:12,009
- My book?
Why?

224
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:14,269
- Because it ends the way
they all do in a couple days,

225
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:17,037
with 20 blank pages.

226
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:18,447
Something's about to happen,
something magical

227
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:20,008
and really fucking bad,
and I think it's--

228
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:21,477
- It's Ember.
He's been doing

229
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,884
all sorts of fucked up shit
in Fillory,

230
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,987
bucket list shit.

231
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:26,989
What's in my book?

232
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,290
- You do your recon,

233
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:30,821
find out Prince Ess of Loria
has taken Whitespire.

234
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:32,028
- Shit.

235
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:34,929
- Then kidnap Idri,
who I guess is a rat,

236
00:11:34,962 --> 00:11:38,072
turn him back, then camp here
trying to find the perfect spell

237
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:40,128
to force Ember to keep
his mitts off of Fillory.

238
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:41,127
- But if my book ends, then--

239
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:42,498
- Then--exactly.

240
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,065
We know that doesn't work,

241
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:47,884
so you need to anything else--
anything.

242
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:49,938
Pick a plan and commit.

243
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:52,507
- If it's written,
isn't it written?

244
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,045
- Yes, but I think
you can change it.

245
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:56,982
- Okay, so we can save Fillory

246
00:11:57,017 --> 00:12:00,017
if we subscribe to a "free will"
view of the universe,

247
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,153
which is fair.

248
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:02,518
So what am I supposed to do?

249
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,885
- Go. Get Idri.

250
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:06,825
Hurry.

251
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,030
I just got one thing
I gotta button up.

252
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,062
[door opens]

253
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:12,798
- Hey.

254
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,533
I calculated a portal
to Tahiti.

255
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,337
- Hold up.

256
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:18,109
- No.

257
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:20,108
You warned them.

258
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,040
You've done enough.
You get to be done.

259
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,235
- I'm sorry.
Believe me, I'd rather--

260
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:25,246
- No, none of it matters,
Penny.

261
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:26,248
[whoosh]

262
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,319
Oh, come on!

263
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:30,848
- Penny, you're needed at once.

264
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:32,824
- I'm busy.
- Bit of an emergency.

265
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:34,093
We need our full staff.

266
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:35,291
- Are you crazy?

267
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:36,892
He's dying.

268
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:38,994
- Yes, because he went
into a restricted area,

269
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:41,856
which lethally poisoned him and
puts him on strict probation,

270
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:44,255
but most assuredly does not mean
he's excused from work.

271
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:46,097
We'll take every step
to keep him comfortable.

272
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:47,573
- What the hell is wrong
with you?

273
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,540
- Kady, knowledge itself
is at stake.

274
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:54,771
That is more important
than any single one of us.

275
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,110
I'll give you a moment
to say good-bye.

276
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:01,916
- No.
No, not good-bye.

277
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:04,119
- Kady, listen, I--
- No, I'm telling you,

278
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:05,891
[whoosh]
this isn't fair.

279
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,019
God damn it!

280
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:14,897
.

281
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:15,598
- Just crack the damn lock.

282
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,400
Hurry, before
some fairy asshole sees us.

283
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:21,131
- I'm going as fast as I can.

284
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:26,412
- Fen?
Are you okay?

285
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:27,839
Sweetie, do you know
where you are?

286
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,605
- A plane laid atop our own,

287
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,882
so the Fairy Castle
and Whitespire actually occupy

288
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:35,623
the same space and time,
but two dimensions.

289
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,488
Or possibly the same dimension,
but incredibly sped up

290
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:40,088
like that one episode
of "Star Trek" where--

291
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,590
- Just get the damn chain,
Josh.

292
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,591
- No.

293
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:47,393
Not without my baby.
They took her away.

294
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:50,127
- You have to come with us,
okay?

295
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:53,073
Get the goddamn shackles,
Hoberman.

296
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,430
[chains clink]
Grab her with me.

297
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:55,597
Come on.

298
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:57,365
Come on.
[door opens]

299
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,365
- There you are.

300
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:02,437
The Queen will see you now.

301
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:05,445

[croaking]

306
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:29,604
- You've been making yourself
quite at home,

307
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:32,936
sneaking around my castle.

308
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:34,673
- It's actually
more like my castle

309
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,607
that you guys have made
some weird AM radio version of.

310
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:43,116
- What is it that you seek,
rude little Earth girl?

311
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,550
- The woman and child
you stole.

312
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:49,194
- You made a deal.

313
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:52,462
- That deal was
inhumane bullshit

314
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:54,632
made under total duress.

315
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,598
Look...

316
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,530
just tell me what you want,
okay, lady?

317
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:02,436
- The child is mine.

318
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:06,273
Now on to business at hand.

319
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:08,176
- No, the baby is
the business.

320
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:11,408
- Ember is dangerously bored
of Fillory.

321
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:14,954
You underestimated
how devastating it can be

322
00:15:14,982 --> 00:15:17,552
to displease a god.

323
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:21,294
- We've been trying to get
ahold of Ember for months.

324
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:22,721
He ignores us.

325
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:26,355
- Because you ask for things.

326
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:29,563
Offer something to him instead.

327
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:32,566
- How do you know all this?

328
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:35,299
- As it is
in our shared interest

329
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:37,395
for your High King
to succeed,

330
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,567
I'm inclined to let you
go help him.

331
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:43,606
- Great. Josh, Fen, the baby
and I will go right now.

332
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:46,283
- You know it doesn't work
that way.

333
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:50,383
Now, are you familiar
with this?

334
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,647
- No.
- But goddamn.

335
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,585
[sniffs]
Smells good. [laughs]

336
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,691
- Even better to a god.

337
00:15:56,723 --> 00:16:00,193
It will draw Ember.

338
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:02,357
Take it.
Bake it into--

339
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:05,225
- I know this one.
Little cakes.

340
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:07,565
He loves little cakes.

341
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,670
Okay.

342
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,472
Point the way back.

343
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:13,374
- Certainly.

344
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:16,606
As soon as I've exacted
the toll.

345
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:19,653
Travel from this world
costs, dear.

346
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,749
I don't make the rules.

347
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:26,321
Oh, that's right.
Yes, I do.

348
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:29,063
We'll be seeing each other soon
I suspect.

*

351
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,667
- So, how's Alice?

352
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,640
- Eliot, I--
- We need your help, Q.

353
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:46,774
You gave her
the no-secret-cutting shit

354
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:48,376
from the keg, right?
- Yes.

355
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:49,808
Physically,
she's perfectly safe,

356
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:53,552
but mentally--
whew!

357
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:57,075
What am I supposed to do?

358
00:16:57,117 --> 00:17:00,087
[quiet music]

359
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:07,290
*

360
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:12,031
- You know what you learn
when you're a High King?

361
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,473
Screwing up is inevitable,

362
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:20,513
and there are some fuck ups
you can never un-fuck.

363
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,640
It's infuriating and
it is heartbreaking, but--

364
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:24,805
- Think I destroyed her, Eliot.

365
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:27,654
- She made plenty of her own
choices along the way.

366
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,450
I'm not saying it doesn't suck.
I'm saying...

367
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:33,624
Fillory needs you.

368
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:37,323
You chose to be a king.
This is what that means.

369
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:42,803
We have a plan, but...

370
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,334
We need someone who speaks
fluent fanboy.

371
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,142
[knocking at the door]

372
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:02,181
.

373
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:02,945
- You're sitting in my chair,
asshole.

374
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:05,287
- Where the hell are
the guards?

375
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:06,418
- Fast asleep, sorry.

376
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:08,163
- Watch where you point
that thing.

377
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:09,888
- Dad.

378
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,622
You're okay.

379
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:14,328
I-I had to do this.
You were a rat.

380
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:16,401
- Could I have
my throne back now?

381
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:17,799
I'll fight if you want.

382
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,530
I've become pretty boss
with a broadsword.

383
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:21,896
- You have...

384
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,304
so don't.

385
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:26,444
- Fine.

386
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:32,907
- Always did like to storm out.

387
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,805
[door slams]

388
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:37,147
I should go too.

389
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:39,894
I should be there for my people,
whatever happens.

390
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,249
- You mean in case I fail?

391
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:42,558
- You won't.

392
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:45,356
- Hmm.

393
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:48,162
You know, since Ember
banished me,

394
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:53,865
I wonder if that nullified
my whole Fillorian contract.

395
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:01,242
- We could check.

396
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:04,244
[soft music]

397
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:11,247
*

398
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:18,487
- Uh, okay, so the thing is,
this blank spot,

399
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:20,455
it's coming up fast,
and it lines up

400
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,703
with everything that you were
saying about Ember.

401
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:25,599
- Is this tree
too asymmetrical?

402
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:28,942
- It's nice. I--

403
00:19:28,968 --> 00:19:30,868
[sighs]

404
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:33,473
So there's no way that you would
want to help us, like, at all?

405
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:36,612
- One cannot just show up

406
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:40,453
after one's faked
one's own death.

407
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,620
I'm sorry.

408
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:44,949
The end of Fillory
makes me sad as well.

409
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:48,264
- So Fillory really is done?

410
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:50,318
- I like you.

411
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:52,727
You care about things.

412
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:55,629
- Yeah, it's not really a trait
that's helped me much.

413
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:57,462
- But it could be
if it were applied

414
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:59,597
to not trying to fix
the unfixable,

415
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:04,472
but rather something fresh
and more perfect,

416
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:06,544
like, say...

417
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:14,252
Care to take a visit?
Make some notes?

418
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:15,921
- Um, I--uh--
- I'm sorry,

419
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:17,718
but you're acting
like I'm asking you,

420
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,950
whereas I am a god
and you are a hairless monkey,

421
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:24,017
so nod and say thank you.

422
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,626
All right.

423
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:28,698
Let's go to the pocket world
formerly known as Cuba.

424
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,358
[whoosh]

425
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:42,512
[rhythmic thrumming]

426
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:45,976
- Whoa!
[breathing hard]

427
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:48,422
Coming back
from the fairy world

428
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:51,048
is a little rockier
than getting there.

429
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,353
- You don't fucking say.

430
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:55,386
- Are you okay?

431
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:59,693
[dark music]

432
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:02,456
- Jesus.

433
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:05,965
- Fen wouldn't come
because they have your daughter.

434
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:08,028
I'm sorry.

435
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:10,667
I'll keep trying.

436
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:12,713
I promise, El.

437
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:16,439
First we need to deal
with that cock, Ember.

438
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:20,646
- We come bearing bait.
[chuckles]

439
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:26,089
- I look like Jack Sparrow
if he were played by a man.

440
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:30,358
- I was actually thinking
more like a Fembot Nick Fury.

441
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:36,461
Look--
- No, I need to--

442
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:38,426
- I know, okay?

443
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:43,335
I was angry...and scared
of what you were capable of,

444
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,810
but you were doing your best
in an impossible position

445
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:49,538
that would've crushed anyone,
myself included.

446
00:21:49,576 --> 00:21:51,636
Wait, is your good eye crying
right now?

447
00:21:51,678 --> 00:21:54,348
- No.

448
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:56,381
Yes.

449
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:59,046
And it's not my good eye,
it's my only fucking eye.

450
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:01,645
- Eh--[chuckles]
- It's not funny,

451
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:04,058
you dick, I'm a Cyclops!

452
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:06,630
- A mythological monster
at last.

453
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,759
Box...checked.

454
00:22:10,397 --> 00:22:11,797
- We're trying too hard.

455
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:14,371
- Pardon?

456
00:22:14,401 --> 00:22:16,701
- To just blow past it
and banter.

457
00:22:19,906 --> 00:22:23,076
It's not the same.
Let's not pretend it is, okay?

458
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:28,416
That makes it hurt worse.

459
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:30,778
- I guess we'll just have to
live with the strain

460
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:34,847
till the future
reveals itself.

461
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:37,757
Meantime, that future is
going to be a big, blank,

462
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:41,090
post-apocalyptic nada
unless we do what we do best.

463
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:45,427
- Act out with a total lack
of empathy and impulse control?

464
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:48,665
- Party like the world
depends on it,

465
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,571
'cause Bambi One Eye...

466
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:55,111
.

467
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:55,781
[classical music playing]

468
00:22:56,976 --> 00:23:00,676
[laughter, chatter]

469
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:07,753
*

470
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:12,930
[soft moaning]

471
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:14,529
- Oh, my God.

472
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:16,601
- I threw better orgies
when I was ten.

473
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:18,999
- I give you little cakes.

474
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:21,071
[applause]

475
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,940
I know they're irresistible,
it's the candied fairy hemp,

476
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:27,740
but resist.
This is for our guest of honor.

477
00:23:27,774 --> 00:23:32,484
*

478
00:23:32,512 --> 00:23:35,552
[people murmuring]

479
00:23:49,562 --> 00:23:52,602
- Be brutal.

480
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:57,936
- It's really...
really linear.

481
00:24:06,979 --> 00:24:10,019
[chair scraping]

482
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:19,864
- How's the linguini?

483
00:24:38,044 --> 00:24:39,684
There's nothing wrong with it.

484
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:40,952
- Excellent.

485
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,920
That's excellent.
- [clears throat]

486
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,650
It's maybe a little, uh--

487
00:24:46,686 --> 00:24:47,686
- Chewy?

488
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,690
- Bland.

489
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:50,961
- Bland...good, or?

490
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,890
- Bland is never
really good or bad.

491
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:54,085
- It appeals to all tastes.

492
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:56,626
- Sure, but...

493
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:58,833
usually people, uh--

494
00:24:58,865 --> 00:25:02,735
creatures who can think,
gods even--

495
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:05,169
sometimes like the unknown,
the unexpected,

496
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:07,944
even the offensive.

497
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:09,744
Little bit of, uh...

498
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,750
- Chaos.

499
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:37,898
Happy now?

500
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:39,767
You know who would love this,

501
00:25:39,806 --> 00:25:45,036
who would create an entire world
out of this greasy stain?

502
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:46,707
My brother.

503
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:48,816
- Yes, Ember would make a mess.

504
00:25:48,848 --> 00:25:51,048
- Do not speak to me of Ember!

505
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:56,655
I like you, boy,
but I have a temper.

506
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,830
- Wait, what about
a human sacrifice?

507
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:02,059
- No, unless the cakes
are bad.

508
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:03,704
- [sighs]
Well, they smell great,

509
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,030
but I don't think
they're working, so--

510
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:07,834
[whooshing]
- Little cakes.

511
00:26:07,867 --> 00:26:13,767
Mmm. Ohh.
Mmm. Oh, oh.

512
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:15,136
Oh, yes.

513
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:18,814
- Welcome, Ember,
god of gods.

514
00:26:18,845 --> 00:26:22,745
- Wait, didn't I banish you?

515
00:26:22,782 --> 00:26:24,882
- You did, Lord of All, but...
- I didn't expect this.

516
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,917
- I can explain.
- I...

517
00:26:26,953 --> 00:26:28,123
love it!

518
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:29,164
- Ha.
- A genuine twist,

519
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:30,888
a true surprise.
[giggles]

520
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,863
When was the last time
that happened around here?

521
00:26:32,892 --> 00:26:35,192
- Exactly, and we're
really sorry about that.

522
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:38,867
We've fallen down on the job,
but boredom is death.

523
00:26:38,898 --> 00:26:40,798
I totally agree.
- Ugh, isn't it though?

524
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,073
- It is.
- Mm.

525
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:45,101
- But...we can make Fillory
more exciting

526
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:48,307
and--and watchable than ever.

527
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,210
That's our pitch.
It's a new chapter

528
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:54,252
and the title is "Shit Tons
of Drama and Surprise."

529
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,880
- Intriguing.

530
00:26:58,885 --> 00:27:00,045
How?

531
00:27:00,086 --> 00:27:01,816
- Don't destroy Fillory.

532
00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:03,794
- Shake things up, yes.

533
00:27:03,823 --> 00:27:04,863
- Like the rats.
- [laughs]

534
00:27:04,891 --> 00:27:06,231
Yeah, rats, hilarious.

535
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:07,958
- It was good, wasn't it?

536
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:09,104
- Yes. Yes.
- We're all still laughing.

537
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:10,228
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

538
00:27:10,262 --> 00:27:11,332
- Right, laughing?
- Laughing!

539
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:15,843
[forced laughter]

540
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:18,138
There's so much more
to do here,

541
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:21,070
so many twists and surprises
this world can offer.

542
00:27:21,107 --> 00:27:23,177
- Mm.
- Think back to the moment

543
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:25,979
you created
the first blades of grass.

544
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:28,152
- Sentient trees.
- Talking animals.

545
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,750
- The Wellspring.
- Think back

546
00:27:29,782 --> 00:27:32,992
to what you built
with your brother Umber.

547
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:36,289
- My brother, rest his soul,
was nothing but a simpering,

548
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:39,362
sniping, anal retentive critic,
as well as a--

549
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:42,961
- Greedy, promiscuous,
selfish,

550
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:46,765
credit-hogging,
mouse-eating slob!

551
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,269
- Any talk of this is
mere whimsy,

552
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,270
and it's whimsy itself that I am
tired of and finished with.

553
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:53,872
- We get it, we do. I mean,
try ruling a world of whimsy.

554
00:27:53,906 --> 00:27:54,966
Am I right?
- Mm.

555
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,837
Not so whimsical,
actually.

556
00:27:56,876 --> 00:27:58,876
- Well, then,
let's get it over with.

557
00:27:58,911 --> 00:28:00,281
Why wait?

558
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:02,182
Let's start right now.

559
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:03,784
[deep rumbling]
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

560
00:28:03,816 --> 00:28:05,146
Not what we meant--
[people screaming]

561
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:08,454
Rewind! Rewind! Rewind!
Rewind! Rewind!

562
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:14,164
- Stop!
Are you insane?

563
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:17,003
- No! I mean, we meant...
make it better, make it better.

564
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,899
Less whimsical, more...
meaner maybe, more you.

565
00:28:19,932 --> 00:28:21,972
- Maybe, if I didn't
have to do it alone.

566
00:28:22,001 --> 00:28:24,341
Say what you will
about my dear, departed brother,

567
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,910
but he was a demon
for overwork.

568
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:28,269
Hmm. He had a strange love
for this--

569
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:30,337
- Poor, accursed place.

570
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:32,376
Too late to be helped now.
I...

571
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:34,851
couldn't bear to go back.
I-I won't.

572
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:36,051
[laughs]
I won't.

573
00:28:36,082 --> 00:28:38,352
- Um, actually,
we're already there.

574
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,224
- Where?

575
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:42,922
- Apocalypse! Apocalypse!
Apocalypse!

576
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:44,185
[laughs]

577
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,933
Isn't it wonderful?

578
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:50,198
[suspenseful music]

579
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,859
- What are you doing?

580
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:53,428
You're making a mess!

581
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:56,035
- [grunting]

582
00:29:02,141 --> 00:29:04,411
- I'm....

583
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:06,213
back.
[chuckles]

584
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:08,145
- You're alive.

585
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,280
[laughs]

586
00:29:10,316 --> 00:29:12,946
How is this possible, brother?

587
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:17,215
You died battling Martin
to save me.

588
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,886
[chuckles]

589
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:22,086
Why are you afraid?
I--

590
00:29:22,128 --> 00:29:25,358
I am...so pleased.

591
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:28,367
[ominous music]

592
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,300
*

593
00:29:30,336 --> 00:29:34,066
Martin told me you died...

594
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,406
when he banished me.

595
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:37,341
- Hey, guys, how about a hug?

596
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:39,246
- This is a family
reunion.

597
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:40,978
- This was a family betrayal.

598
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:43,023
Wasn't it?

599
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:47,393
Wasn't it!
- No!

600
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:49,119
No!

601
00:29:49,155 --> 00:29:50,255
I can't be here!

602
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,459
- Oh!
All this time, I thought,

603
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:57,261
"Martin, so powerful."

604
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,126
But no.

605
00:29:59,165 --> 00:30:03,335
He was merely
a brilliant dealmaker.

606
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:08,439
My banishment for your life.

607
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:12,184
Your puny, petty,

608
00:30:12,211 --> 00:30:16,181
putrid nothing of a soul spark!

609
00:30:16,215 --> 00:30:17,915
[growls]
- [grunts]

610
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:22,453
- Brother, please?

611
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:24,958
- [grunts]
- [groans]

612
00:30:24,991 --> 00:30:26,131
Please!

613
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:28,188
- You...always...were

614
00:30:28,227 --> 00:30:29,497
the weak one.

615
00:30:29,528 --> 00:30:31,328
- [choking]
- [laughs]

616
00:30:31,363 --> 00:30:33,373
[suspenseful music]

617
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:35,169

[choking]

621

- [grunts]

622
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:46,447
- [reciting quietly]

623
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:52,322
Come and get me,
you fucking baby.

624
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:55,393
You want to know why
you're so bored?

625
00:30:55,421 --> 00:30:58,161
Because you're too stupid
to get it.

626
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,190
You're too spoiled and entitled
to understand--

627
00:31:01,227 --> 00:31:04,227
- How dare you?
I am a god.

628
00:31:04,263 --> 00:31:07,003
- Are you? Really?

629
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:08,503
I'm not impressed.

630
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:12,204
I've met scary gods, and you?

631
00:31:12,238 --> 00:31:14,968
You're nothing
but a petty tyrant.

632
00:31:15,007 --> 00:31:19,477
[choking]

633
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:21,081
- [grunts]

- [panting]

635
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,422
- Quentin--
[groans]

636
00:31:26,452 --> 00:31:29,592
You...always...

637
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:31,091
surprise.

638
00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:32,993

- [gasps]

642
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:46,410
- Holy fuck.

643
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,110
- Q?

644
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:53,483
I think you just saved
the whole world.

645
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:56,482
[dramatic music]

646
00:32:08,027 --> 00:32:08,187
.

647
00:32:08,227 --> 00:32:09,397
- We are officially
a land of godless heathens,

648
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:12,559
making today the first day

649
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,428
of our societal adulthood.

650
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:17,436
I, for one,
am slightly terrified

651
00:32:17,469 --> 00:32:18,699
and equally excited.

652
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:20,567
And trying not to break
into "Hamilton."

653
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:23,706
And so, I turn over
the next phase of our maturation

654
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:26,082
to our High Queen Margo.

655
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,182
- We need a constitution.

656
00:32:28,214 --> 00:32:29,624
- Pardon?

657
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:31,018
- These are
some pretty good ones here,

658
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:33,190
so let's rip off
the best parts.

659
00:32:35,721 --> 00:32:38,491
[wind howling]

660
00:32:45,031 --> 00:32:47,071
- Hungry?

661
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:53,744
I know Mayakovsky said soft,
bland food for a while, but--

662
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:57,612
I can see that's
not really working.

663
00:32:57,643 --> 00:33:00,653
So I stopped by the farm

664
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:05,049
where Fogg gets
his weekly rasher of bacon.

665
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:06,194
- No thanks.

666
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:08,218
- You sure?

667
00:33:08,254 --> 00:33:10,224
Because--
[groans]

668
00:33:10,256 --> 00:33:12,756
I tried it...

669
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:16,331
and, uh,

670
00:33:16,362 --> 00:33:18,532
it's amazing.

671
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:22,632
- I know what you're
trying to do.

672
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:27,538
- I'm...just trying to do
breakfast food, that's all.

673
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,250
- Oh, fuck you.

674
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:41,321
Mmm.

675
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,163
- Please.

676
00:33:49,128 --> 00:33:50,558
- Fuck.

677
00:33:50,596 --> 00:33:53,196
- Gluttony.

678
00:33:53,232 --> 00:33:55,632
It's an excellent part
of being human.

679
00:33:57,336 --> 00:34:00,106
- I don't remember
many others.

680
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:01,309
- Really?

681
00:34:04,143 --> 00:34:05,613
- Ugh.

682
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:10,819
Hmm, my hands are all greasy.

683
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:12,749
Ugh.

684
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:16,824
With every good thing,
no matter how small it is,

685
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:19,285
it's always...

686
00:34:19,325 --> 00:34:22,825
married to something
so completely disgusting.

687
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:25,161
You can't escape it.

688
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:26,827
- You're right.

689
00:34:26,865 --> 00:34:30,095
It's gross.
We are animals.

690
00:34:42,348 --> 00:34:45,318
[peaceful music]

692
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:49,856
- Why does that feel so good?

693
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:58,661
- I don't know.

694
00:34:58,697 --> 00:35:02,197
It just does.

695
00:35:02,234 --> 00:35:04,774
It always did.

696
00:35:12,911 --> 00:35:15,611
[ragged breaths]

697
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:17,347
[chuckles]

698
00:35:17,383 --> 00:35:18,783
Hmm.

699
00:35:33,332 --> 00:35:35,832
[ship horn blows]

700
00:35:41,207 --> 00:35:44,377
- Look...
I need your help.

701
00:36:05,964 --> 00:36:07,404
- I'm not gonna beg.

702
00:36:07,433 --> 00:36:09,873
I'm not gonna use guilt,
I have no leverage.

703
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:12,971
But Penny's in the Library.
He can be your mole.

704
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,444
But to do that,
he'd have to be alive.

705
00:36:20,979 --> 00:36:23,349
- He'd never know.

706
00:36:23,382 --> 00:36:25,222
Whatever you need,
ask me about it.

707
00:36:25,251 --> 00:36:27,391
He tells me, I tell you.

708
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:34,433
- Who saved her man's life,
so maybe not.

709
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,360
Big picture, right?

710
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:39,199
Deal?

711
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:43,473
- Deal.

712
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:51,437
- I probably shouldn't say this
out loud, but...

713
00:36:51,477 --> 00:36:54,947
this was kind of an okay day.

714
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,880
- Are you bragging?
