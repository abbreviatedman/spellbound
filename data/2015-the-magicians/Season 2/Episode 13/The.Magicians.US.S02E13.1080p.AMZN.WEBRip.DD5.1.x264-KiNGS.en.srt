1
00:00:01,535 --> 00:00:02,615
- Hello, glorious audience.

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,406
It is I, Ember, god of Fillory.

3
00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:07,608
Feel free to bow and grovel.
I'll wait.

4
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:10,044
Oh, but I've got
so much to tell you.

5
00:00:10,078 --> 00:00:13,214
I, with minor help
from my brother Umber... R.I.P...

6
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:16,550
Created a world
intricate as filigree,

7
00:00:16,584 --> 00:00:19,053
and that is what I called it,

8
00:00:19,087 --> 00:00:22,123
except I was a bit drunk,
so... Fillory.

9
00:00:22,156 --> 00:00:23,791
Chock stuffed with magic,

10
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:25,093
chatty animals,

11
00:00:25,126 --> 00:00:26,127
sexy creatures.

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,196
Really, what a planet.

13
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:31,399
I calibrated everything
for maximum entertainment.

14
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:34,568
I decreed it be ruled
by children of Earth,

15
00:00:34,602 --> 00:00:37,338
a glum little planet
known for its plucky magicians.

16
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,307
These brave souls would come,

17
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,242
and when they got boring,
off they went.

18
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:43,444
Case in point, Martin Chatwin.

19
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:46,147
Brave, clever boy, born hero,

20
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,849
yet honestly,
very uncomfortable to watch

21
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,318
once he'd been molested.

22
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:52,320
So, I made
the difficult decision

23
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:53,593
to kick him out and replace him

24
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:56,090
with someone
more punchy and fun,

25
00:00:56,124 --> 00:00:59,327
but Martin was more tenacious
than I gave him credit for.

26
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,495
He drank from the Wellspring
to get strong,

27
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:03,564
screwing Fillory in the process,

28
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:05,666
and set booby traps
for my brother and me,

29
00:01:05,699 --> 00:01:07,468
and before you know it,
Umber's dead

30
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:11,105
and I'm hiding in stupid Loria.

31
00:01:11,139 --> 00:01:13,574
I'm so fucking bored,
children of Earth.

32
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,309
Cut to...
Martin's mutated

33
00:01:15,343 --> 00:01:17,445
into a terrible beast
in a dapper suit.

34
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:20,314
Enter Quentin Coldwater
and his friends...

35
00:01:20,348 --> 00:01:22,116
The Addict, the Victim,

36
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,684
the Bitch, the Scowl,

37
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:25,319
and the Martyr.

38
00:01:25,353 --> 00:01:26,620
I bestowed my blessing,

39
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:28,689
and they set out
to kill The Beast.

40
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:30,258
Of course, they failed.

41
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:32,326
Twist!
They had to start from scratch

42
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,262
with The Beast.
Thrilling.

43
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:37,631
The danger of sublimated trauma
is a major theme in our story,

44
00:01:37,665 --> 00:01:40,201
evidenced by Julia and Martin
teaming up

45
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:42,503
to kill the Earth god
who violated her.

46
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:46,207
All very ambiguous
and poignant... I know!

47
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,576
Julia's partnership
also threw a massive wrench

48
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:51,212
into Quentin's works.
Gut-wrenching!

49
00:01:51,245 --> 00:01:53,581
I was forced to intervene.
Cameo!

50
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,484
I have the befouled
the Wellspring.

51
00:01:56,517 --> 00:01:59,387
Wasn't it tragic
when Alice died?

52
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,489
Wasn't it scary
when she became a niffin?

53
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:03,391
The personal nature of her story

54
00:02:03,424 --> 00:02:06,227
subverted Quentin's
hero's journey nicely.

55
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,362
Character is destiny
and, ultimately,

56
00:02:08,396 --> 00:02:11,265
Quentin is a Magician
of intellect who nevertheless,

57
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:13,701
and to his detriment,
acts from his heart.

58
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:15,403
But I did other things too!

59
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:17,505
Like lead Quentin
to that Candy Witch.

60
00:02:17,538 --> 00:02:19,207
Don't worry, that'll pay off.

61
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,375
I hid the Wellspring ball
in plain sight,

62
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:23,377
made the Rainbow Bridge bloom,

63
00:02:23,411 --> 00:02:25,246
stole from the River Watcher

64
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:27,248
so he'd be good and angry
when Penny stiffed him.

65
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:28,916
Oh, I know, good one.

66
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:30,618
It was I who caused
the High King's bride

67
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:33,654
to ovulate on the right day,
leading to...

68
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:34,688
- Preg-nant!

69
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:36,657
- Ultimately leading to...

70
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,659
The fairies can
bring back the Wellspring?

71
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:40,361
- They can.
- - And in return?

72
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:41,595
- A royal child of Whitespire.

73
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:43,364
Take her to the dungeon.

74
00:02:43,397 --> 00:02:45,266
- He will transport you
to the fairy realm.

75
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:47,235
- I repeatedly broke
the filtration system

76
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:49,703
so the Wellspring would be
unpredictable and fun.

77
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:53,207
All those pesky "brownouts"?
Moi!

78
00:02:53,241 --> 00:02:55,409
To be sure,
the Order is on to me.

79
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:57,578
They're in a panic
about the Great Blank Spot,

80
00:02:57,611 --> 00:03:00,281
surmising a fatal hit
to the Wellspring.

81
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:02,983
True, I am nearly finished
with Fillory.

82
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,151
Every chapter must end,

83
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:07,288
and on the eve
of my benevolent destruction

84
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:08,598
I'm getting it all
out of my system.

85
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:10,624
Like causing
sudden climate change

86
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:13,427
that kills entire
tedious species of wildlife,

87
00:03:13,461 --> 00:03:15,396
turning people
into delicious rats.

88
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:17,398
All the babies this week
woke up with no mouths.

89
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:18,999
Oh, horrifying!

90
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,210
- I bet you're wondering
what happens next,

91
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:22,703
and that is how I know
I've done my job well.

92
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:25,506
Sit back, have a nice pipe
of marijuana,

93
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,275
and enjoy my grand opus.

94
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:30,444
I call it Fillory's Last Gasp.

95
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:13,487
- I just miss the fire, okay?

96
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,725
- Drink this.

97
00:04:20,528 --> 00:04:22,430
- What is it?

98
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:24,798
- Renders you unable to harm
your own body.

99
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:32,406
This is all pointless, Q.

100
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:35,576
You can't medicate me away.

101
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,278
- Just fucking drink it.

102
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:46,820
All of it.

103
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,294
Ugh.

104
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:01,502
Why did you bring me back?

105
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,807
- Why do you keep
asking me that?

106
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,742
I...

107
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:11,679
I watched you almost die trying
to bring your brother back.

108
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,747
You loved him.
I love you.

109
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:21,855
- I'd like to be alone now.

110
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:31,365
*

111
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:39,849
I take that to mean
I'm improving.

112
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:41,141
- Well, your skin's healing.

113
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,377
Obviously, your lungs are,

114
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:46,447
to use a technical term, fucked,

115
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,681
but more importantly...

116
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:49,617
- Just say it.

117
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,827
- You have lesions
on your spine,

118
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,153
and they're growing
aggressively.

119
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,154
- Cancer.

120
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,889
- Call it cancer plus.

121
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:59,960
- Whatever you were exposed to
has spell residue all over it.

122
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:01,629
- So a magician did this?

123
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:06,634
- Well, if so, it may be
a code we can crack.

124
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:07,801
- How long?

125
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:08,912
- Well, it's hard to say,
but I have

126
00:06:08,936 --> 00:06:10,704
my entire department
working on it...

127
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:13,140
- I mean how long till I die
if you don't crack it?

128
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:15,443
- Two or three weeks.

129
00:06:15,476 --> 00:06:17,911
But I promise you, we are doing
everything we can to...

130
00:06:17,945 --> 00:06:19,580
- Yeah.
- Okay...

131
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:21,482
- I'm not waiting to die
in a hospital bed.

132
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:23,517
- Okay, I don't think...
- I'm not!

133
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:27,755
- Can we talk please?
- Yes.

134
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:40,934
- Hey, there, hot stuff.

135
00:06:43,637 --> 00:06:46,507
- No offense... you might look
as bad as I do.

136
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,477
- I doubt that.

137
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,912
You're dying.

138
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:55,015
All I am is a little strung out.

139
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:56,750
- Kady...

140
00:06:56,784 --> 00:06:58,519
- What? It's not about me.

141
00:06:58,552 --> 00:06:59,853
- What happened?

142
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:01,922
Tell me.

143
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,893
- Reynard's gone.

144
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:10,531
I should be happy, but...

145
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:13,867
it wasn't how I wanted it.

146
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:16,804
It's not enough.

147
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:19,473
God, I feel like bashing
my head into a wall.

148
00:07:23,977 --> 00:07:27,815
Why can't anything
just be fixed?

149
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:29,817
- Life, I guess.

150
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:34,755
*

151
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,931
I don't want you to die.

152
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,265
- Of course not.

153
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,834
I'm the best lay of your life.

154
00:07:46,867 --> 00:07:48,736
- Shut up.

155
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:52,239
What are we gonna do?

156
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:54,575
- Wrap our minds around it.

157
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:57,745
Kady, let's not waste time
being mad, okay?

158
00:07:57,778 --> 00:07:59,255
I'm just gonna find
Quentin and Eliot,

159
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,650
just gonna make
a couple pit stops first.

160
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,606
- That's, um...
- a nice sconce.

161
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,908
- Did you, um...
- Spit it out.

162
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,945
You want something.

163
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,547
- Yeah.

164
00:08:33,581 --> 00:08:35,048
First...

165
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,953
Are you okay?

166
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:43,957
- I'm whole again.

167
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:45,893
- W...

168
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:47,127
Which is a... a good thing.

169
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,763
- If by good
you mean crying jags

170
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:52,032
and mountains of guilt
and panic attacks,

171
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:54,101
then, yeah,
I'm doing fucking great.

172
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:56,336
And since I better be getting
back to one of them soon,

173
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,606
whether I like it or not,
how can I help you?

174
00:08:58,639 --> 00:08:59,840
- Q says you have an amulet

175
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,975
that would make me
invisible to a god.

176
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:28,602
- Um, I don't pretend
to understand

177
00:09:28,636 --> 00:09:30,070
what you've been through,

178
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:31,905
but I can tell you

179
00:09:31,939 --> 00:09:33,674
the way you're relating
to that couch

180
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:35,142
is not unknown to me.

181
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:37,711
- Then you know
I want to be alone.

182
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:44,351
- And, um, also that you
probably shouldn't be right now.

183
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:45,686
- Why do you care?

184
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:48,055
- I... just do.

185
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,192
Come with me...

186
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:55,796
and help me try to convince
Ember to let us keep Fillory.

187
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:57,998
- Why?
- Because I have never met

188
00:09:58,031 --> 00:10:00,801
anyone less willing to take
no for an answer.

189
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:02,169
- But I betrayed you, remember?

190
00:10:05,873 --> 00:10:09,076
That was a long time ago.

191
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:13,847
I need help, and you do too.

192
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:16,116
Let's kill a few birds.

193
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:17,851
What do you say?
Wanna put some pants on

194
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:19,853
and help me save all of magic?

195
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:31,965
*

196
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:46,179
- I'll go talk to Eliot
and Quentin.

197
00:10:49,182 --> 00:10:51,118
- Uh, Kady...
- Just tell Penny

198
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:54,087
that I went to find
a quiet place and do some dope.

199
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:57,157
I'm ready to leave when he is.

200
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,933
- Look... here's the deal.

201
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:09,136
I just read your book
in the library, both volumes.

202
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:12,005
- My book?
- Why?

203
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:14,274
- Because it ends the way
they all do in a couple days,

204
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:17,044
with 20 blank pages.

205
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:18,454
Something's about to happen,
something magical

206
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:20,023
and really fucking bad,
and I think it's...

207
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:21,481
- It's Ember.
- He's been doing

208
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,884
all sorts of fucked up shit
in Fillory,

209
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,986
bucket list shit.

210
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:26,987
What's in my book?

211
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,288
- You do your recon,

212
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:30,824
find out Prince Ess of Loria
has taken Whitespire.

213
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:32,025
- Shit.

214
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:34,928
- Then kidnap Idri,
who I guess is a rat,

215
00:11:34,962 --> 00:11:38,065
turn him back, then camp here
trying to find the perfect spell

216
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:40,133
to force Ember to keep
his mitts off of Fillory.

217
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:41,134
- But if my book ends, then...

218
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:42,502
- Then... exactly.

219
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,071
We know that doesn't work,

220
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:47,875
so you need to anything else...
Anything.

221
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:49,943
Pick a plan and commit.

222
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:52,512
- If it's written,
isn't it written?

223
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,048
- Yes, but I think
you can change it.

224
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:56,984
- Okay, so we can save Fillory

225
00:11:57,017 --> 00:12:00,020
if we subscribe to a "free will"
view of the universe,

226
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,154
which is fair.

227
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:02,522
So what am I supposed to do?

228
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,892
- Go. Get Idri.

229
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:06,827
Hurry.

230
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,029
I just got one thing
I gotta button up.

231
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:12,800
- Hey.

232
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,534
I calculated a portal to Tahiti.

233
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,336
- Hold up.

234
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:18,105
- No.

235
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:20,107
You warned them.

236
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,042
You've done enough.
You get to be done.

237
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,252
- I'm sorry.
- Believe me, I'd rather...

238
00:12:23,276 --> 00:12:25,245
- No, none of it matters, Penny.

239
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,315
Oh, come on!

240
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:30,851
- Penny, you're needed at once.

241
00:12:30,884 --> 00:12:32,820
- I'm busy.
- Bit of an emergency.

242
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:34,087
We need our full staff.

243
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:35,288
- Are you crazy?

244
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:36,890
He's dying.

245
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:38,992
- Yes, because he went
into a restricted area,

246
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:41,862
which lethally poisoned him and
puts him on strict probation,

247
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:44,264
but most assuredly does not mean
he's excused from work.

248
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:46,099
We'll take every step
to keep him comfortable.

249
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:47,567
- What the hell is wrong
with you?

250
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,538
- Kady, knowledge itself
is at stake.

251
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:54,774
That is more important
than any single one of us.

252
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,112
I'll give you a moment
to say good-bye.

253
00:12:59,146 --> 00:13:01,915
- No.
- No, not good-bye.

254
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:04,117
- Kady, listen, I...
- No, I'm telling you,

255
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:05,886
this isn't fair.

256
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,021
God damn it!

257
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:16,008
- Just crack the damn lock.

258
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,407
Hurry, before
some fairy asshole sees us.

259
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:21,134
- I'm going as fast as I can.

260
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:26,406
- Fen?
- Are you okay?

261
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:27,841
Sweetie, do you know
where you are?

262
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,609
- A plane laid atop our own,

263
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,880
so the Fairy Castle
and Whitespire actually occupy

264
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:35,615
the same space and time,
but two dimensions.

265
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,485
Or possibly the same dimension,
but incredibly sped up

266
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:40,096
like that one episode
of "Star Trek" where...

267
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,588
- Just get the damn chain, Josh.

268
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,590
- No.

269
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:47,394
Not without my baby.
They took her away.

270
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:50,130
- You have to come with us,
okay?

271
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:53,066
Get the goddamn shackles,
Hoberman.

272
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,434
Grab her with me.

273
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:55,602
Come on.

274
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:57,370
Come on.

275
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,373
- There you are.

276
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:02,442
The Queen will see you now.

277
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:07,347
*

278
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:29,602
- You've been making yourself
quite at home,

279
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:32,940
sneaking around my castle.

280
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:34,674
- It's actually
more like my castle

281
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,610
that you guys have made
some weird AM radio version of.

282
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:43,116
- What is it that you seek,
rude little Earth girl?

283
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:45,552
- The woman and child you stole.

284
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:49,189
- You made a deal.

285
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:52,459
- That deal was
inhumane bullshit

286
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:54,627
made under total duress.

287
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:57,597
Look...

288
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,532
just tell me what you want,
okay, lady?

289
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:02,435
- The child is mine.

290
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:06,273
Now on to business at hand.

291
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:08,175
- No, the baby is the business.

292
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:11,411
- Ember is dangerously bored
of Fillory.

293
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:14,948
You underestimated
how devastating it can be

294
00:15:14,982 --> 00:15:17,550
to displease a god.

295
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:21,288
- We've been trying to get
ahold of Ember for months.

296
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:22,722
He ignores us.

297
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:26,359
- Because you ask for things.

298
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:29,562
Offer something to him instead.

299
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:32,565
- How do you know all this?

300
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:35,302
- As it is
in our shared interest

301
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:37,404
for your High King to succeed,

302
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:39,572
I'm inclined to let you
go help him.

303
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:43,610
- Great. Josh, Fen, the baby
and I will go right now.

304
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:46,279
- You know it doesn't work
that way.

305
00:15:46,313 --> 00:15:50,383
Now, are you familiar with this?

306
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,652
- No.
- But goddamn.

307
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,587
Smells good.

308
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,689
- Even better to a god.

309
00:15:56,723 --> 00:16:00,193
It will draw Ember.

310
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:02,362
Take it.
Bake it into...

311
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:05,232
- I know this one.
- Little cakes.

312
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:07,567
He loves little cakes.

313
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,669
Okay.

314
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,471
Point the way back.

315
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:13,373
- Certainly.

316
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:16,609
As soon as I've exacted
the toll.

317
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:19,646
Travel from this world
costs, dear.

318
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,748
I don't make the rules.

319
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:26,319
Oh, that's right.
Yes, I do.

320
00:16:26,353 --> 00:16:29,056
We'll be seeing each other soon
I suspect.

321
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:37,464
*

322
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:40,667
- So, how's Alice?

323
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,636
- Eliot, I...
- We need your help, Q.

324
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:46,773
You gave her
the no-secret-cutting shit

325
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:48,375
- from the keg, right?
- Yes.

326
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:49,809
Physically,
she's perfectly safe,

327
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:53,546
but mentally...
Whew!

328
00:16:55,115 --> 00:16:57,084
What am I supposed to do?

329
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:07,294
*

330
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:12,031
- You know what you learn
when you're a High King?

331
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:16,469
Screwing up is inevitable,

332
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:20,507
and there are some fuck ups
you can never un-fuck.

333
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,642
It's infuriating and
it is heartbreaking, but...

334
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:24,811
- Think I destroyed her, Eliot.

335
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:27,647
- She made plenty of her own
choices along the way.

336
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:31,451
I'm not saying it doesn't suck.
I'm saying...

337
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:33,620
Fillory needs you.

338
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:37,324
You chose to be a king.
This is what that means.

339
00:17:40,593 --> 00:17:42,795
We have a plan, but...

340
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:47,334
We need someone who speaks
fluent fanboy.

341
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:03,695
- You're sitting in my chair,
asshole.

342
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:05,285
- Where the hell are the guards?

343
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:06,419
- Fast asleep, sorry.

344
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:08,155
- Watch where you point
that thing.

345
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:09,889
- Dad.

346
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,624
You're okay.

347
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:14,327
I-I had to do this.
You were a rat.

348
00:18:14,361 --> 00:18:16,396
- Could I have
my throne back now?

349
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:17,797
I'll fight if you want.

350
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,532
I've become pretty boss
with a broadsword.

351
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:21,901
- You have...

352
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,303
so don't.

353
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:26,439
- Fine.

354
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:32,912
- Always did like to storm out.

355
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:37,150
I should go too.

356
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:39,886
I should be there for my people,
whatever happens.

357
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:41,254
- You mean in case I fail?

358
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:42,555
- You won't.

359
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:45,358
- Hmm.

360
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:48,161
You know, since Ember
banished me,

361
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:53,866
I wonder if that nullified
my whole Fillorian contract.

362
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:01,241
- We could check.

363
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:11,251
*

364
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:18,491
- Uh, okay, so the thing is,
this blank spot,

365
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:20,460
it's coming up fast,
and it lines up

366
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,695
with everything that you were
saying about Ember.

367
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:25,598
- Is this tree too asymmetrical?

368
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:28,935
- It's nice. I...

369
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:33,473
So there's no way that you would
want to help us, like, at all?

370
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:36,609
- One cannot just show up

371
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:40,447
after one's faked
one's own death.

372
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,615
I'm sorry.

373
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:44,951
The end of Fillory
makes me sad as well.

374
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:48,255
- So Fillory really is done?

375
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:50,323
- I like you.

376
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:52,725
You care about things.

377
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:55,628
- Yeah, it's not really a trait
that's helped me much.

378
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:57,464
- But it could be
if it were applied

379
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:59,599
to not trying to fix
the unfixable,

380
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:04,471
but rather something fresh
and more perfect,

381
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:06,539
like, say...

382
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:14,247
Care to take a visit?
Make some notes?

383
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:15,915
- Um, I... uh...
- I'm sorry,

384
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:17,717
but you're acting
like I'm asking you,

385
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,953
whereas I am a god
and you are a hairless monkey,

386
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:24,023
so nod and say thank you.

387
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,625
All right.

388
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:28,695
Let's go to the pocket world
formerly known as Cuba.

389
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:45,978
- Whoa!

390
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:48,415
Coming back from the fairy world

391
00:20:48,448 --> 00:20:51,050
is a little rockier
than getting there.

392
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,353
- You don't fucking say.

393
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:55,388
- Are you okay?

394
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:02,462
- Jesus.

395
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:05,965
- Fen wouldn't come
because they have your daughter.

396
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:08,034
I'm sorry.

397
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:10,670
I'll keep trying.

398
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:12,705
I promise, El.

399
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:16,443
First we need to deal
with that cock, Ember.

400
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:20,647
- We come bearing bait.

401
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:26,085
- I look like Jack Sparrow
if he were played by a man.

402
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:30,357
- I was actually thinking
more like a Fembot Nick Fury.

403
00:21:34,361 --> 00:21:36,463
- Look...
- No, I need to...

404
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:38,431
- I know, okay?

405
00:21:38,465 --> 00:21:43,336
I was angry... and scared
of what you were capable of,

406
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,805
but you were doing your best
in an impossible position

407
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:49,542
that would've crushed anyone,
myself included.

408
00:21:49,576 --> 00:21:51,644
Wait, is your good eye crying
right now?

409
00:21:51,678 --> 00:21:54,347
- No.

410
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:56,383
Yes.

411
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:59,051
And it's not my good eye,
it's my only fucking eye.

412
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:01,654
- Eh...
- It's not funny,

413
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:04,056
you dick, I'm a Cyclops!

414
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:06,626
- A mythological monster
at last.

415
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,761
Box... checked.

416
00:22:10,397 --> 00:22:11,798
- We're trying too hard.

417
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:14,367
- Pardon?

418
00:22:14,401 --> 00:22:16,703
- To just blow past it
and banter.

419
00:22:19,906 --> 00:22:23,075
It's not the same.
Let's not pretend it is, okay?

420
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:28,415
That makes it hurt worse.

421
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:30,783
- I guess we'll just have to
live with the strain

422
00:22:30,817 --> 00:22:34,854
till the future reveals itself.

423
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:37,757
Meantime, that future is
going to be a big, blank,

424
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:41,093
post-apocalyptic nada
unless we do what we do best.

425
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:45,432
- Act out with a total lack
of empathy and impulse control?

426
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:48,668
- Party like the world
depends on it,

427
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,570
'cause Bambi One Eye...

428
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:07,754
*

429
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:14,527
- Oh, my God.

430
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:16,596
- I threw better orgies
when I was ten.

431
00:23:16,629 --> 00:23:18,998
- I give you little cakes.

432
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,936
I know they're irresistible,
it's the candied fairy hemp,

433
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:27,740
but resist.
This is for our guest of honor.

434
00:23:27,774 --> 00:23:32,479
*

435
00:23:49,562 --> 00:23:52,599
- Be brutal.

436
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:57,937
- It's really...
- really linear.

437
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:19,859
- How's the linguini?

438
00:24:38,044 --> 00:24:39,679
There's nothing wrong with it.

439
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:40,947
- Excellent.

440
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,916
That's excellent.

441
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,653
It's maybe a little, uh...

442
00:24:46,686 --> 00:24:47,687
- Chewy?

443
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,688
- Bland.

444
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:50,957
- Bland... good, or?

445
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,892
- Bland is never
really good or bad.

446
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:54,093
- It appeals to all tastes.

447
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:56,629
- Sure, but...

448
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:58,831
usually people, uh...

449
00:24:58,865 --> 00:25:02,735
Creatures who can think,
gods even...

450
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:05,171
Sometimes like the unknown,
the unexpected,

451
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:07,940
even the offensive.

452
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:09,742
Little bit of, uh...

453
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,752
- Chaos.

454
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:37,904
Happy now?

455
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:39,772
You know who would love this,

456
00:25:39,806 --> 00:25:45,044
who would create an entire world
out of this greasy stain?

457
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:46,713
My brother.

458
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:48,815
- Yes, Ember would make a mess.

459
00:25:48,848 --> 00:25:51,050
- Do not speak to me of Ember!

460
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:56,656
I like you, boy,
but I have a temper.

461
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,826
- Wait, what about
a human sacrifice?

462
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:02,061
- No, unless the cakes are bad.

463
00:26:02,094 --> 00:26:03,696
Well, they smell great,

464
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,040
but I don't think
they're working, so...

465
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:07,834
Little cakes.

466
00:26:07,867 --> 00:26:13,773
Mmm. Ohh.
Mmm. Oh, oh.

467
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:15,141
Oh, yes.

468
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:18,811
- Welcome, Ember, god of gods.

469
00:26:18,845 --> 00:26:22,749
- Wait, didn't I banish you?

470
00:26:22,782 --> 00:26:24,893
- You did, Lord of All, but...
- I didn't expect this.

471
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:26,919
- I can explain.
- I...

472
00:26:26,953 --> 00:26:28,120
love it!

473
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:29,155
- Ha.
- A genuine twist,

474
00:26:29,188 --> 00:26:30,890
a true surprise.

475
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:32,859
When was the last time
that happened around here?

476
00:26:32,892 --> 00:26:35,194
- Exactly, and we're
really sorry about that.

477
00:26:35,227 --> 00:26:38,865
We've fallen down on the job,
but boredom is death.

478
00:26:38,898 --> 00:26:40,800
- I totally agree.
- Ugh, isn't it though?

479
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,068
- It is.
- Mm.

480
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:45,104
- But... we can make Fillory
more exciting

481
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:48,307
and... and watchable than ever.

482
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,209
That's our pitch.
It's a new chapter

483
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:54,246
and the title is "Shit Tons
of Drama and Surprise."

484
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,883
- Intriguing.

485
00:26:58,885 --> 00:27:00,052
How?

486
00:27:00,086 --> 00:27:01,821
- Don't destroy Fillory.

487
00:27:01,854 --> 00:27:03,790
- Shake things up, yes.

488
00:27:03,823 --> 00:27:04,857
Like the rats.

489
00:27:04,891 --> 00:27:06,225
Yeah, rats, hilarious.

490
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:07,960
- It was good, wasn't it?

491
00:27:07,994 --> 00:27:09,104
- Yes. Yes.
- We're all still laughing.

492
00:27:09,128 --> 00:27:10,229
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

493
00:27:10,262 --> 00:27:11,422
- Right, laughing?
- Laughing!

494
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:18,137
There's so much more to do here,

495
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:21,073
so many twists and surprises
this world can offer.

496
00:27:21,107 --> 00:27:23,175
- Mm.
- Think back to the moment

497
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:25,978
you created
the first blades of grass.

498
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:28,147
- Sentient trees.
- Talking animals.

499
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,749
- The Wellspring.
- Think back

500
00:27:29,782 --> 00:27:32,985
to what you built
with your brother Umber.

501
00:27:33,019 --> 00:27:36,288
- My brother, rest his soul,
was nothing but a simpering,

502
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:39,358
sniping, anal retentive critic,
as well as a...

503
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:42,962
- Greedy, promiscuous, selfish,

504
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:46,766
credit-hogging,
mouse-eating slob!

505
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,267
- Any talk of this is
mere whimsy,

506
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,278
and it's whimsy itself that I am
tired of and finished with.

507
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:53,873
- We get it, we do. I mean,
try ruling a world of whimsy.

508
00:27:53,906 --> 00:27:54,974
- Am I right?
- Mm.

509
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,843
Not so whimsical, actually.

510
00:27:56,876 --> 00:27:58,878
- Well, then,
let's get it over with.

511
00:27:58,911 --> 00:28:00,279
Why wait?

512
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:02,181
Let's start right now.

513
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:03,783
No, no, no, no, no, no!

514
00:28:03,816 --> 00:28:05,151
Not what we meant...

515
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:08,454
Rewind! Rewind! Rewind!
Rewind! Rewind!

516
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:14,160
- Stop!
- Are you insane?

517
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:16,996
- No! I mean, we meant...
- make it better, make it better.

518
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,899
Less whimsical, more...
meaner maybe, more you.

519
00:28:19,932 --> 00:28:21,968
- Maybe, if I didn't
have to do it alone.

520
00:28:22,001 --> 00:28:24,336
Say what you will
about my dear, departed brother,

521
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,906
but he was a demon for overwork.

522
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:28,283
Hmm. He had a strange love
for this...

523
00:28:28,307 --> 00:28:30,342
- Poor, accursed place.

524
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:32,378
Too late to be helped now.
I...

525
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:34,847
couldn't bear to go back.
I-I won't.

526
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:36,048
I won't.

527
00:28:36,082 --> 00:28:38,350
- Um, actually,
we're already there.

528
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,219
- Where?

529
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:42,922
- Apocalypse! Apocalypse!
- Apocalypse!

530
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,925
Isn't it wonderful?

531
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,864
- What are you doing?

532
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:53,432
You're making a mess!

533
00:29:02,141 --> 00:29:04,410
- I'm...

534
00:29:04,443 --> 00:29:06,212
back.

535
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:08,147
- You're alive.

536
00:29:10,316 --> 00:29:12,952
How is this possible, brother?

537
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:17,223
You died battling Martin
to save me.

538
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:22,094
Why are you afraid?
I...

539
00:29:22,128 --> 00:29:25,364
I am... so pleased.

540
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,302
*

541
00:29:30,336 --> 00:29:34,073
Martin told me you died...

542
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,407
when he banished me.

543
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:37,343
- Hey, guys, how about a hug?

544
00:29:37,376 --> 00:29:39,245
- This is a family reunion.

545
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:40,980
- This was a family betrayal.

546
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:43,015
Wasn't it?

547
00:29:44,383 --> 00:29:47,386
- Wasn't it!
- No!

548
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:49,121
No!

549
00:29:49,155 --> 00:29:50,256
I can't be here!

550
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,458
- Oh!
- All this time, I thought,

551
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:57,263
"Martin, so powerful."

552
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,131
But no.

553
00:29:59,165 --> 00:30:03,335
He was merely
a brilliant dealmaker.

554
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:08,440
My banishment for your life.

555
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:12,178
Your puny, petty,

556
00:30:12,211 --> 00:30:16,182
putrid nothing of a soul spark!

557
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:22,454
- Brother, please?

558
00:30:24,991 --> 00:30:26,125
Please!

559
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:28,194
- You... always... were

560
00:30:28,227 --> 00:30:29,495
the weak one.

561
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:36,302
*

562
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:52,318
Come and get me,
you fucking baby.

563
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:55,397
You want to know why
you're so bored?

564
00:30:55,421 --> 00:30:58,157
Because you're too stupid
to get it.

565
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,193
You're too spoiled and entitled
to understand...

566
00:31:01,227 --> 00:31:04,230
- How dare you?
- I am a god.

567
00:31:04,263 --> 00:31:06,999
- Are you? Really?

568
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:08,500
I'm not impressed.

569
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:12,204
I've met scary gods, and you?

570
00:31:12,238 --> 00:31:14,974
You're nothing
but a petty tyrant.

571
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,417
- Quentin...

572
00:31:26,452 --> 00:31:29,588
You... always...

573
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:31,090
surprise.

574
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:46,405
- Holy fuck.

575
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,110
- Q?

576
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:53,479
I think you just saved
the whole world.

577
00:32:08,227 --> 00:32:10,067
- We are officially
a land of godless heathens,

578
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:12,564
making today the first day

579
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,433
of our societal adulthood.

580
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:17,436
I, for one,
am slightly terrified

581
00:32:17,469 --> 00:32:18,704
and equally excited.

582
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:20,572
And trying not to break
into "Hamilton."

583
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:23,709
And so, I turn over
the next phase of our maturation

584
00:32:23,742 --> 00:32:26,078
to our High Queen Margo.

585
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,180
- We need a constitution.

586
00:32:28,214 --> 00:32:29,615
- Pardon?

587
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:31,026
- These are
some pretty good ones here,

588
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:33,185
so let's rip off the best parts.

589
00:32:45,031 --> 00:32:47,066
- Hungry?

590
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:53,739
I know Mayakovsky said soft,
bland food for a while, but...

591
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:57,609
I can see that's
not really working.

592
00:32:57,643 --> 00:33:00,646
So I stopped by the farm

593
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:05,051
where Fogg gets
his weekly rasher of bacon.

594
00:33:05,084 --> 00:33:06,185
- No thanks.

595
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:08,220
- You sure?

596
00:33:08,254 --> 00:33:10,222
Because...

597
00:33:10,256 --> 00:33:12,758
I tried it...

598
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:16,328
and, uh,

599
00:33:16,362 --> 00:33:18,530
it's amazing.

600
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:22,634
- I know what you're
trying to do.

601
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:27,539
- I'm... just trying to do
breakfast food, that's all.

602
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,249
- Oh, fuck you.

603
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:41,320
Mmm.

604
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,155
- Please.

605
00:33:49,128 --> 00:33:50,562
- Fuck.

606
00:33:50,596 --> 00:33:53,199
- Gluttony.

607
00:33:53,232 --> 00:33:55,634
It's an excellent part
of being human.

608
00:33:57,336 --> 00:34:00,106
- I don't remember many others.

609
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:01,307
- Really?

610
00:34:04,143 --> 00:34:05,611
- Ugh.

611
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:10,816
Hmm, my hands are all greasy.

612
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:12,751
Ugh.

613
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:16,822
With every good thing,
no matter how small it is,

614
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:19,291
it's always...

615
00:34:19,325 --> 00:34:22,828
married to something
so completely disgusting.

616
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:25,164
You can't escape it.

617
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:26,832
- You're right.

618
00:34:26,865 --> 00:34:30,102
It's gross.
We are animals.

619
00:34:45,351 --> 00:34:47,653
*

620
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:49,855
- Why does that feel so good?

621
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:58,664
- I don't know.

622
00:34:58,697 --> 00:35:02,201
It just does.

623
00:35:02,234 --> 00:35:04,770
It always did.

624
00:35:17,383 --> 00:35:18,784
Hmm.

625
00:35:41,207 --> 00:35:44,376
- Look...
- I need your help.

626
00:36:05,964 --> 00:36:07,399
- I'm not gonna beg.

627
00:36:07,433 --> 00:36:09,868
I'm not gonna use guilt,
I have no leverage.

628
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:12,971
But Penny's in the Library.
He can be your mole.

629
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,441
But to do that,
he'd have to be alive.

630
00:36:20,979 --> 00:36:23,349
- He'd never know.

631
00:36:23,382 --> 00:36:25,217
Whatever you need,
ask me about it.

632
00:36:25,251 --> 00:36:27,386
He tells me, I tell you.

633
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:34,426
- Who saved her man's life,
so maybe not.

634
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,362
Big picture, right?

635
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:39,197
Deal?

636
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:43,469
- Deal.

637
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:51,443
- I probably shouldn't say this
out loud, but...

638
00:36:51,477 --> 00:36:54,946
this was kind of an okay day.

639
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,882
- Are you bragging?

640
00:36:56,915 --> 00:36:58,950
- No.

641
00:37:00,486 --> 00:37:02,788
Kind of.

642
00:37:02,821 --> 00:37:05,857
Not about this... entirely.

643
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,397
I also kind of killed a god.

644
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:16,302
Huh. Hilarious.

645
00:37:16,335 --> 00:37:18,804
- No, seriously.

646
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:21,239
Ember.

647
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:27,779
I mean, he was...
erasing the whole thing.

648
00:37:27,813 --> 00:37:30,882
- Wait, wait,
you can't be serious.

649
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:32,284
- Yeah.

650
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:33,985
- No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

651
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:36,388
- No, I didn't want to.
- He had just killed his brother.

652
00:37:36,422 --> 00:37:39,991
He was going after Julia.
He was genocidally insane.

653
00:37:40,025 --> 00:37:42,328
- You don't get it.

654
00:37:42,361 --> 00:37:43,529
Jesus.

655
00:37:43,562 --> 00:37:45,864
When I was a-a niffin,
I saw things.

656
00:37:45,897 --> 00:37:47,933
I saw everything
from the beginning of time.

657
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:49,535
- Calm down...
- No, I understand

658
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:51,370
the way the universe works, Q,

659
00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:54,773
the Wellspring, the hierarchies,
the plumbing.

660
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:57,309
I was inside it.

661
00:37:57,343 --> 00:38:01,513
Gods like Ember have parents,
you idiot!

662
00:38:01,547 --> 00:38:02,914
- I-I'm not following.

663
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:05,050
- The old gods,
the creators of the universe,

664
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:07,052
of all magic itself.

665
00:38:07,085 --> 00:38:09,488
To Ember, we're like...
We're like toys,

666
00:38:09,521 --> 00:38:11,990
but to them we're...
We're cells.

667
00:38:12,023 --> 00:38:13,525
When we're harmless
they ignore us,

668
00:38:13,559 --> 00:38:16,428
but when we become malignant,
they amputate.

669
00:38:16,462 --> 00:38:18,072
- Now, if you're gonna use
stones like this,

670
00:38:18,096 --> 00:38:19,531
it's imperative that...

671
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:23,402
Excuse me.

672
00:38:23,435 --> 00:38:25,003
Excuse me, this is...

673
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:29,541
- Okay, wait. Like,
so there's an actual plumber?

674
00:38:29,575 --> 00:38:32,010
Like the Mario Brother
of the gods?

675
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,512
- Yes.
- And he can just...

676
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:35,447
- I guarantee you,
he's doing it.

677
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:46,958
- Attention, please keep calm

678
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:49,361
and follow
all code green procedures.

679
00:38:49,395 --> 00:38:52,364
Please remember not to interact
and simply gather...

680
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:58,637
Attention,
please keep calm and follow...

681
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:05,877
*

682
00:39:16,522 --> 00:39:17,856
- Professor?

683
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:20,358
- Mayakovsky!

684
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:38,187
- All right, everyone,
open your books to chapter 16.

685
00:39:42,514 --> 00:39:50,514
*

686
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:02,868
Who can translate
the Borkulo Rendering

687
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:04,970
from its original Hungarian?

688
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:08,907
No point in raising hands.

689
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,642
Remember?

690
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,044
- I can.

691
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:15,113
- Dean Fogg?
- Sorry to interrupt.

692
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:17,215
- Yes, Josh, go ahead.

693
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,917
- Well, I was online
last night...

694
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:21,453
- The answer is no.

695
00:40:21,487 --> 00:40:23,822
There is no actual evidence

696
00:40:23,855 --> 00:40:27,559
of a magical surge
in Sedona, Arizona.

697
00:40:27,593 --> 00:40:28,560
- Yeah, but what about in...

698
00:40:28,594 --> 00:40:29,961
- Or Kenya,

699
00:40:29,995 --> 00:40:33,632
or Machu Picchu, or China...

700
00:40:33,665 --> 00:40:35,567
or anywhere.

701
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:40,572
Magic is gone.

702
00:40:40,606 --> 00:40:42,574
The best we can do
is accept that,

703
00:40:42,608 --> 00:40:44,910
and continue
our theoretical studies,

704
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:48,013
to stay ready for its return.

705
00:40:48,046 --> 00:40:49,981
- So you think that's possible?

706
00:40:50,015 --> 00:40:52,183
- Anything is possible, Alice.

707
00:40:52,217 --> 00:40:54,152
Was, anyway.

708
00:40:57,589 --> 00:40:59,858
- Look at you,

709
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:03,161
playing the part
of the bright, young girl.

710
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:04,630
- Joseph?

711
00:41:06,632 --> 00:41:09,000
- Ah, yes.

712
00:41:09,034 --> 00:41:12,037
I can see my Alice
in there still.

713
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,471
Good.

714
00:41:15,707 --> 00:41:17,142
- Are you all right?

715
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:20,278
- I am as I appear... dying.

716
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:23,181
- So it is true.

717
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:24,716
Magic's gone everywhere.

718
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:29,621
- The creatures, cryptids,
sylphs, dragons, unicorns,

719
00:41:29,655 --> 00:41:34,092
even the pointless vampires
are all as they were.

720
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:38,129
But those of us who drew
on the power of the Wellspring,

721
00:41:38,163 --> 00:41:41,232
well, as you can see...

722
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:43,201
- I want to help.
- I'm here, Alice,

723
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:45,303
because it is you
who needs help.

724
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:49,174
- What?
- As a niffin, you made enemies.

725
00:41:49,207 --> 00:41:52,310
I'm here to warn you
that one of them seeks you.

726
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,579
- Who?

727
00:41:53,612 --> 00:41:55,046
- The Lamprey.

728
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:59,250
You do recall what you did
to his family?

729
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:00,251
- Yes.

730
00:42:00,285 --> 00:42:02,053
- Most amusing at the time,

731
00:42:02,087 --> 00:42:05,624
but to The Lamprey,
cause for vengeance.

732
00:42:05,657 --> 00:42:09,227
It knows you're weak.
It knows you're here.

733
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:13,732
*

734
00:42:13,765 --> 00:42:16,067
- What do I...

735
00:42:16,101 --> 00:42:17,736
Oh...

736
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:25,010
- Democracy has to take
a backseat.

737
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:28,980
Without magic,
the people are terrified,

738
00:42:29,014 --> 00:42:31,349
and that is just one step
from an angry mob.

739
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,619
- And that's how royal heads
end up in baskets.

740
00:42:33,652 --> 00:42:35,687
I get it.
I get it.

741
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:42,060
- This is an undereducated,
pre-industrial populous, Eliot.

742
00:42:42,093 --> 00:42:43,729
They need to be ruled.

743
00:42:43,762 --> 00:42:46,998
- They need to be inspired.

744
00:42:47,032 --> 00:42:49,234
- They need to think
they're being inspired

745
00:42:49,267 --> 00:42:51,136
as they're being ruled.

746
00:42:51,169 --> 00:42:55,106
I'm talking curfew,
martial law, conscription,

747
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:57,075
and severe
and public punishment.

748
00:42:57,108 --> 00:42:59,711
- Okay. Can we maybe
make our way

749
00:42:59,745 --> 00:43:01,780
to King and Queen Caligula,
please? Maybe a...

750
00:43:01,813 --> 00:43:04,382
- How do you not recognize me?
- I'm the King's wife!

751
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,184
- Tell them!
- Oh, my God.

752
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:12,991
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

753
00:43:13,024 --> 00:43:15,627
How did you get here?

754
00:43:15,661 --> 00:43:17,262
Simple.

755
00:43:17,295 --> 00:43:19,164
I just gave them my toes.

756
00:43:19,197 --> 00:43:21,700
- Gave... who your toes?

757
00:43:21,733 --> 00:43:23,268
- The fairies.

758
00:43:25,203 --> 00:43:27,172
- I wanted to stay...

759
00:43:27,205 --> 00:43:31,743
to be close to our daughter,
but I had to warn you.

760
00:43:31,777 --> 00:43:33,144
They're coming.

761
00:43:35,313 --> 00:43:37,115
- They're here.

762
00:43:41,787 --> 00:43:48,827
*

763
00:43:56,735 --> 00:44:03,775
*

764
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:21,326
- Boo.

765
00:44:22,728 --> 00:44:23,729
- Hey.

766
00:44:23,762 --> 00:44:24,796
- Hey.

767
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:26,197
- Jules, I...

768
00:44:26,231 --> 00:44:27,465
Hi.

769
00:44:30,235 --> 00:44:32,303
- How did you get in here?

770
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:36,174
- Well, your... your fence
is a little shoddy.

771
00:44:36,207 --> 00:44:38,343
- Right.

772
00:44:38,376 --> 00:44:41,179
Welcome to the new normal.

773
00:44:41,212 --> 00:44:44,215
You know, 'cause I killed
all magic fucking everywhere.

774
00:44:44,249 --> 00:44:46,918
Uh... Sorry.

775
00:44:46,952 --> 00:44:50,221
That was definitely
a two-hander.

776
00:44:50,255 --> 00:44:52,290
I'll be burning in hell
right next to you,

777
00:44:52,323 --> 00:44:54,392
but hey, at least we have
each other.

778
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:57,362
- Hmm.

779
00:44:57,395 --> 00:45:00,365
So how are you?

780
00:45:00,398 --> 00:45:02,100
- Fine.

781
00:45:02,133 --> 00:45:05,370
- Listen...
- How's law school?

782
00:45:05,403 --> 00:45:06,437
- I quit.

783
00:45:06,471 --> 00:45:08,807
- Okay.

784
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,442
Why?

785
00:45:11,476 --> 00:45:16,247
- Because I need to show you
something,

786
00:45:16,281 --> 00:45:20,151
and you need to promise me that
you're not going to tell anyone,

787
00:45:20,185 --> 00:45:22,888
'cause you're the only person
that I trust.

788
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:26,424
- I promise.

789
00:45:32,363 --> 00:45:33,531
Jules, it's not gonna work.

790
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:36,367
- Just give me a second.

791
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:37,769
We all get flashes

792
00:45:37,803 --> 00:45:39,204
that we can do it again,
but it's...

793
00:45:41,306 --> 00:45:43,842
Oh, my God.

794
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:46,511
- How?

795
00:45:46,544 --> 00:45:49,514
- I have no idea.

796
00:45:52,517 --> 00:45:58,256
*

797
00:45:58,289 --> 00:46:00,425
- * Ooh, wah

798
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:03,829
*

799
00:46:03,862 --> 00:46:05,964
* Ooh, wah

800
00:46:05,997 --> 00:46:09,367
*

801
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,536
* Ooh, wah

802
00:46:11,569 --> 00:46:18,209
*
