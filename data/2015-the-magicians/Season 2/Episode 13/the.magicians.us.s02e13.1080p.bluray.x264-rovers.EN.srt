1
00:00:01,151 --> 00:00:03,192
Hello, glorious audience.

2
00:00:03,193 --> 00:00:05,687
It is I, Ember, god of Fillory.

3
00:00:05,722 --> 00:00:08,122
Feel free to bow and grovel. I'll wait.

4
00:00:08,158 --> 00:00:10,225
Oh, but I've got so much to tell you.

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:13,428
I, with minor help from my
brother Umber... R.I.P....

6
00:00:13,463 --> 00:00:16,864
created a world intricate as filigree,

7
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,234
and that is what I called it,

8
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:22,337
except I was a bit drunk, so... Fillory.

9
00:00:22,372 --> 00:00:24,172
Chock stuffed with magic,

10
00:00:24,207 --> 00:00:25,306
chatty animals,

11
00:00:25,342 --> 00:00:26,341
sexy creatures.

12
00:00:26,376 --> 00:00:28,443
Really, what a planet.

13
00:00:28,478 --> 00:00:31,679
I calibrated everything
for maximum entertainment.

14
00:00:31,715 --> 00:00:34,916
I decreed it be ruled
by children of Earth,

15
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:37,619
a glum little planet known
for its plucky magicians.

16
00:00:37,654 --> 00:00:39,587
These brave souls would come,

17
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:41,489
and when they got boring, off they went.

18
00:00:41,524 --> 00:00:43,758
Case in point, Martin Chatwin.

19
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:46,394
Brave, clever boy, born hero,

20
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:49,264
yet honestly,
very uncomfortable to watch

21
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,598
once he'd been molested.

22
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:52,600
So, I made the difficult decision

23
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:53,935
to kick him out and replace him

24
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,304
with someone more punchy and fun,

25
00:00:56,339 --> 00:00:59,641
but Martin was more tenacious
than I gave him credit for.

26
00:00:59,676 --> 00:01:01,776
He drank from the
Wellspring to get strong,

27
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,878
screwing Fillory in the process,

28
00:01:03,913 --> 00:01:06,180
and set booby traps
for my brother and me,

29
00:01:06,216 --> 00:01:07,715
and before you know it, Umber's dead

30
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:11,252
and I'm hiding in stupid Loria.

31
00:01:11,288 --> 00:01:13,888
I'm so fucking bored, children of Earth.

32
00:01:13,923 --> 00:01:15,556
Cut two... Martin's mutated

33
00:01:15,592 --> 00:01:17,725
into a terrible beast in a dapper suit.

34
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:20,561
Enter Quentin Coldwater
and his friends...

35
00:01:20,597 --> 00:01:22,297
the Addict, the Victim,

36
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,198
the Bitch, the Scowl,

37
00:01:24,234 --> 00:01:25,566
and the Martyr.

38
00:01:25,602 --> 00:01:26,934
I bestowed my blessing,

39
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,203
and they set out to kill The Beast.

40
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:30,471
Of course, they failed.

41
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,607
Twist! They had to start from scratch

42
00:01:32,642 --> 00:01:34,509
with The Beast. Thrilling.

43
00:01:34,544 --> 00:01:37,979
The danger of sublimated trauma
is a major theme in our story,

44
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,448
evidenced by Julia and Martin teaming up

45
00:01:40,483 --> 00:01:42,817
to kill the Earth god who violated her.

46
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:46,454
All very ambiguous and poignant... I know!

47
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:48,890
Julia's partnership also
threw a massive wrench

48
00:01:48,925 --> 00:01:51,459
into Quentin's works. Gut-wrenching!

49
00:01:51,494 --> 00:01:53,895
I was forced to intervene. Cameo!

50
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,798
I have the befouled the Wellspring.

51
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:59,667
Wasn't it tragic when Alice died?

52
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:01,703
Wasn't it scary when
she became a niffin?

53
00:02:01,738 --> 00:02:03,604
The personal nature of her story

54
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,441
subverted Quentin's
hero's journey nicely.

55
00:02:06,476 --> 00:02:08,576
Character is destiny and, ultimately,

56
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:11,479
Quentin is a Magician of
intellect who nevertheless,

57
00:02:11,514 --> 00:02:14,215
and to his detriment,
acts from his heart.

58
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,650
But I did other things too!

59
00:02:15,685 --> 00:02:17,752
Like lead Quentin to that Candy Witch.

60
00:02:17,787 --> 00:02:19,387
Don't worry, that'll pay off.

61
00:02:19,422 --> 00:02:21,622
I hid the Wellspring
ball in plain sight,

62
00:02:21,658 --> 00:02:23,624
made the Rainbow Bridge bloom,

63
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,460
stole from the River Watcher

64
00:02:25,495 --> 00:02:27,462
so he'd be good and angry
when Penny stiffed him.

65
00:02:27,497 --> 00:02:29,297
Oh, I know, good one.

66
00:02:29,332 --> 00:02:30,898
It was I who caused
the High King's bride

67
00:02:30,934 --> 00:02:33,968
to ovulate on the right day,
leading to...

68
00:02:34,003 --> 00:02:35,002
Preg-nant!

69
00:02:35,038 --> 00:02:36,938
Ultimately leading to...

70
00:02:36,973 --> 00:02:38,973
The fairies can
bring back the Wellspring?

71
00:02:39,008 --> 00:02:40,608
- They can.
- And in return?

72
00:02:40,643 --> 00:02:42,009
A royal child of Whitespire.

73
00:02:42,045 --> 00:02:43,246
Take her to the dungeon.

74
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:45,513
He will transport you
to the fairy realm.

75
00:02:45,548 --> 00:02:47,448
I repeatedly broke the filtration system

76
00:02:47,484 --> 00:02:50,051
so the Wellspring would
be unpredictable and fun.

77
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:53,421
All those pesky "brownouts"? Moi!

78
00:02:53,456 --> 00:02:55,656
To be sure, the Order is on to me.

79
00:02:55,692 --> 00:02:57,892
They're in a panic about
the Great Blank Spot,

80
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,528
surmising a fatal hit to the Wellspring.

81
00:03:00,563 --> 00:03:03,331
True, I am nearly finished with Fillory.

82
00:03:03,366 --> 00:03:04,766
Every chapter must end,

83
00:03:04,801 --> 00:03:07,435
and on the eve of my
benevolent destruction

84
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,836
I'm getting it all out of my system.

85
00:03:08,872 --> 00:03:10,905
Like causing sudden climate change

86
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:13,674
that kills entire tedious
species of wildlife,

87
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,610
turning people into delicious rats.

88
00:03:15,645 --> 00:03:17,612
All the babies this week
woke up with no mouths.

89
00:03:17,647 --> 00:03:19,347
Oh, horrifying!

90
00:03:19,382 --> 00:03:20,848
I bet you're wondering
what happens next,

91
00:03:20,884 --> 00:03:22,984
and that is how I know
I've done my job well.

92
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:25,753
Sit back, have a nice pipe of marijuana,

93
00:03:25,789 --> 00:03:27,455
and enjoy my grand opus.

94
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,625
I call it Fillory's Last Gasp.

95
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,634
I just miss the fire, okay?

96
00:04:16,573 --> 00:04:17,939
Drink this.

97
00:04:21,472 --> 00:04:22,403
What is it?

98
00:04:22,404 --> 00:04:25,046
Renders you unable to
harm your own body.

99
00:04:30,086 --> 00:04:32,553
This is all pointless, Q.

100
00:04:34,157 --> 00:04:35,823
You can't medicate me away.

101
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:38,392
Just fucking drink it.

102
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:47,101
All of it.

103
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,442
Ugh.

104
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:01,649
Why did you bring me back?

105
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,054
Why do you keep asking me that?

106
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:08,990
I...

107
00:05:09,025 --> 00:05:11,893
I watched you almost die trying
to bring your brother back.

108
00:05:11,928 --> 00:05:13,995
You loved him. I love you.

109
00:05:20,136 --> 00:05:22,103
I'd like to be alone now.

110
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:40,154
I take that to mean I'm improving.

111
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:41,522
Well, your skin's healing.

112
00:05:41,558 --> 00:05:43,558
Obviously, your lungs are,

113
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,627
to use a technical term, fucked,

114
00:05:46,663 --> 00:05:47,929
but more importantly...

115
00:05:47,964 --> 00:05:49,864
Just say it.

116
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:51,098
You have lesions on your spine,

117
00:05:51,134 --> 00:05:53,534
and they're growing aggressively.

118
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,535
Cancer.

119
00:05:54,571 --> 00:05:56,203
Call it cancer plus.

120
00:05:56,239 --> 00:06:00,508
Whatever you were exposed to
has spell residue all over it.

121
00:06:00,543 --> 00:06:01,842
So a magician did this?

122
00:06:01,878 --> 00:06:06,847
Well, if so,
it may be a code we can crack.

123
00:06:06,883 --> 00:06:08,049
How long?

124
00:06:08,084 --> 00:06:10,918
Well, it's hard to say, but I have
my entire department working on it...

125
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:13,487
I mean how long till I
die if you don't crack it?

126
00:06:14,514 --> 00:06:15,590
Two or three weeks.

127
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,192
But I promise you,
we are doing everything we can to...

128
00:06:18,227 --> 00:06:19,760
- Yeah.
- Okay...

129
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,629
I'm not waiting to
die in a hospital bed.

130
00:06:21,664 --> 00:06:23,631
- Okay, I don't think...
- I'm not!

131
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:28,002
- Can we talk please?
- Yes.

132
00:06:39,215 --> 00:06:41,182
Hey, there, hot stuff.

133
00:06:43,853 --> 00:06:46,721
No offense...
you might look as bad as I do.

134
00:06:46,756 --> 00:06:49,657
I doubt that.

135
00:06:49,692 --> 00:06:52,226
You're dying.

136
00:06:52,261 --> 00:06:55,529
All I am is a little strung out.

137
00:06:55,565 --> 00:06:56,964
Kady...

138
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,733
What? It's not about me.

139
00:06:58,768 --> 00:07:00,134
What happened?

140
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,103
Tell me.

141
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,107
Reynard's gone.

142
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,711
I should be happy, but...

143
00:07:10,747 --> 00:07:14,115
it wasn't how I wanted it.

144
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:17,018
It's not enough.

145
00:07:17,053 --> 00:07:19,620
God, I feel like bashing
my head into a wall.

146
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:28,062
Why can't anything just be fixed?

147
00:07:28,097 --> 00:07:30,064
Life, I guess.

148
00:07:40,576 --> 00:07:42,420
I don't want you to die.

149
00:07:44,247 --> 00:07:45,646
Of course not.

150
00:07:45,682 --> 00:07:47,114
I'm the best lay of your life.

151
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:48,916
Shut up.

152
00:07:51,654 --> 00:07:52,620
What are we gonna do?

153
00:07:52,655 --> 00:07:54,755
Wrap our minds around it.

154
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:57,992
Kady, let's not waste time
being mad, okay?

155
00:07:58,027 --> 00:07:59,627
I'm just gonna find Quentin and Eliot,

156
00:07:59,662 --> 00:08:02,797
just gonna make a
couple pit stops first.

157
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:26,650
That's, um... a nice sconce.

158
00:08:26,685 --> 00:08:28,122
- Did you, um...
- Spit it out.

159
00:08:29,892 --> 00:08:32,193
You want something.

160
00:08:32,228 --> 00:08:33,661
Yeah.

161
00:08:33,696 --> 00:08:35,329
First...

162
00:08:38,904 --> 00:08:40,167
Are you okay?

163
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,238
I'm whole again.

164
00:08:44,395 --> 00:08:45,848
W...

165
00:08:46,175 --> 00:08:47,641
Which is a... a good thing.

166
00:08:47,677 --> 00:08:49,977
If by good you mean crying jags

167
00:08:50,012 --> 00:08:52,346
and mountains of guilt
and panic attacks,

168
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:54,615
then, yeah, I'm doing fucking great.

169
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,717
And since I better be getting
back to one of them soon,

170
00:08:56,753 --> 00:08:58,786
whether I like it or not,
how can I help you?

171
00:08:58,821 --> 00:09:02,156
Q says you have an amulet
that would make me invisible to a god.

172
00:09:25,715 --> 00:09:30,317
Um, I don't pretend to understand
what you've been through,

173
00:09:30,896 --> 00:09:32,119
but I can tell you

174
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:35,623
the way you're relating to that couch
is not unknown to me.

175
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,892
Then you know I want to be alone.

176
00:09:37,927 --> 00:09:44,698
And, um, also that you probably
shouldn't be right now.

177
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:45,833
Why do you care?

178
00:09:45,868 --> 00:09:48,269
I... just do.

179
00:09:50,807 --> 00:09:52,706
Come with me...

180
00:09:52,742 --> 00:09:56,010
and help me try to convince
Ember to let us keep Fillory.

181
00:09:56,045 --> 00:09:58,279
- Why?
- Because I have never met

182
00:09:58,314 --> 00:10:01,015
anyone less willing to
take no for an answer.

183
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,650
But I betrayed you, remember?

184
00:10:06,055 --> 00:10:09,356
That was a long time ago.

185
00:10:09,392 --> 00:10:14,094
I need help, and you do too.

186
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,397
Let's kill a few birds.

187
00:10:16,432 --> 00:10:18,098
What do you say? Wanna put some pants on

188
00:10:18,134 --> 00:10:20,034
and help me save all of magic?

189
00:10:44,026 --> 00:10:46,460
I'll go talk to Eliot and Quentin.

190
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,440
- Uh, Kady...
- Just tell Penny

191
00:10:51,475 --> 00:10:54,410
that I went to find a quiet
place and do some dope.

192
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:57,446
I'm ready to leave when he is.

193
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:06,188
Look... here's the deal.

194
00:11:06,951 --> 00:11:09,425
I just read your book
in the library, both volumes.

195
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,261
My book? Why?

196
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,797
Because it ends the way
they all do in a couple days,

197
00:11:14,832 --> 00:11:17,299
with 20 blank pages.

198
00:11:17,335 --> 00:11:18,801
Something's about to happen,
something magical

199
00:11:18,836 --> 00:11:20,269
and really fucking bad,
and I think it's...

200
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:24,106
It's Ember. He's been doing
all sorts of fucked up shit in Fillory,

201
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,242
bucket list shit.

202
00:11:26,277 --> 00:11:27,243
What's in my book?

203
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:28,811
You do your recon,

204
00:11:28,846 --> 00:11:31,080
find out Prince Ess of Loria
has taken Whitespire.

205
00:11:31,115 --> 00:11:32,314
Shit.

206
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:35,184
Then kidnap Idri, who I guess is a rat,

207
00:11:35,219 --> 00:11:38,387
turn him back, then camp here
trying to find the perfect spell

208
00:11:38,422 --> 00:11:40,456
to force Ember to keep
his mitts off of Fillory.

209
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:41,423
But if my book ends, then...

210
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:42,925
Then... exactly.

211
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,360
We know that doesn't work,

212
00:11:44,395 --> 00:11:48,130
so you need to do
anything else... anything.

213
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:50,199
Pick a plan and commit.

214
00:11:50,234 --> 00:11:52,935
If it's written, isn't it written?

215
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,337
Yes, but I think you can change it.

216
00:11:55,373 --> 00:11:57,273
Okay, so we can save Fillory

217
00:11:57,308 --> 00:12:00,309
if we subscribe to a "free will"
view of the universe,

218
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,477
which is fair.

219
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:02,911
So what am I supposed to do?

220
00:12:02,947 --> 00:12:05,114
Go. Get Idri.

221
00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:07,016
Hurry.

222
00:12:07,051 --> 00:12:09,285
I just got one thing I gotta button up.

223
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,988
Hey.

224
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:14,923
I calculated a portal to Tahiti.

225
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,859
Hold up.

226
00:12:16,894 --> 00:12:18,394
No.

227
00:12:18,429 --> 00:12:20,396
You warned them.

228
00:12:20,431 --> 00:12:22,298
You've done enough. You get to be done.

229
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,532
I'm sorry. Believe me, I'd rather...

230
00:12:23,567 --> 00:12:25,567
No, none of it matters, Penny.

231
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,837
Oh, come on!

232
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,073
Penny, you're needed at once.

233
00:12:31,108 --> 00:12:33,008
- I'm busy.
- Bit of an emergency.

234
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:34,343
We need our full staff.

235
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,611
Are you crazy?

236
00:12:35,646 --> 00:12:37,146
He's dying.

237
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:39,281
Yes, because he went
into a restricted area,

238
00:12:39,317 --> 00:12:42,117
which lethally poisoned him
and puts him on strict probation,

239
00:12:42,153 --> 00:12:44,620
but most assuredly does not
mean he's excused from work.

240
00:12:44,655 --> 00:12:46,388
We'll take every step
to keep him comfortable.

241
00:12:46,424 --> 00:12:47,990
What the hell is wrong with you?

242
00:12:48,025 --> 00:12:51,960
Kady, knowledge itself is at stake.

243
00:12:52,451 --> 00:12:54,930
That is more important
than any single one of us.

244
00:12:57,668 --> 00:12:59,401
I'll give you a moment to say good-bye.

245
00:12:59,437 --> 00:13:02,104
No. No, not good-bye.

246
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:04,340
- Kady, listen, I...
- No, I'm telling you,

247
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,041
this isn't fair.

248
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:08,210
God damn it!

249
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,245
Fuck!

250
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,416
Just crack the damn lock.

251
00:13:17,417 --> 00:13:19,307
Hurry, before some
fairy asshole sees us.

252
00:13:19,308 --> 00:13:22,255
I'm going as fast as I can.

253
00:13:23,892 --> 00:13:27,627
Fen? Are you okay?

254
00:13:27,663 --> 00:13:29,129
Sweetie, do you know where you are?

255
00:13:29,164 --> 00:13:30,897
A plane laid atop our own,

256
00:13:30,933 --> 00:13:34,167
so the Fairy Castle and
Whitespire actually occupy

257
00:13:34,203 --> 00:13:36,903
the same space and time,
but two dimensions.

258
00:13:36,939 --> 00:13:39,739
Or possibly the same dimension,
but incredibly sped up

259
00:13:39,775 --> 00:13:41,241
like that one episode of
"Star Trek" where...

260
00:13:41,276 --> 00:13:42,843
Just get the damn chain, Josh.

261
00:13:42,878 --> 00:13:44,911
No.

262
00:13:44,947 --> 00:13:48,648
Not without my baby. They took her away.

263
00:13:48,684 --> 00:13:51,318
You have to come with us, okay?

264
00:13:51,353 --> 00:13:54,254
Get the goddamn shackles, Hoberman.

265
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:56,212
Grab her with me. Come on.

266
00:13:56,412 --> 00:13:58,592
Hey. Come on.

267
00:13:59,761 --> 00:14:01,628
There you are.

268
00:14:01,663 --> 00:14:03,630
The Queen will see you now.

269
00:14:28,657 --> 00:14:30,857
You've been making
yourself quite at home,

270
00:14:30,893 --> 00:14:34,227
sneaking around my castle.

271
00:14:34,263 --> 00:14:35,962
It's actually more like my castle

272
00:14:35,998 --> 00:14:38,832
that you guys have made some
weird AM radio version of.

273
00:14:40,769 --> 00:14:44,271
What is it that you seek,
rude little Earth girl?

274
00:14:44,306 --> 00:14:46,740
The woman and child you stole.

275
00:14:48,911 --> 00:14:50,179
You made a deal.

276
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,713
That deal was inhumane bullshit

277
00:14:53,749 --> 00:14:55,882
made under total duress.

278
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:58,885
Look...

279
00:14:58,921 --> 00:15:00,754
just tell me what you want, okay, lady?

280
00:15:00,789 --> 00:15:03,590
The child is mine.

281
00:15:04,927 --> 00:15:07,394
Now on to the business at hand.

282
00:15:07,429 --> 00:15:09,296
No, the baby is the business.

283
00:15:09,331 --> 00:15:12,599
Ember is dangerously bored of Fillory.

284
00:15:12,634 --> 00:15:16,202
You underestimated how
devastating it can be

285
00:15:16,238 --> 00:15:18,738
to displease a god.

286
00:15:18,774 --> 00:15:22,442
We've been trying to get
ahold of Ember for months.

287
00:15:22,477 --> 00:15:24,010
He ignores us.

288
00:15:24,046 --> 00:15:27,547
Because you ask for things.

289
00:15:27,582 --> 00:15:30,784
Offer something to him instead.

290
00:15:30,819 --> 00:15:32,589
How do you know all this?

291
00:15:33,822 --> 00:15:38,591
As it is in our shared interest
for your High King to succeed,

292
00:15:38,627 --> 00:15:40,794
I'm inclined to let you go help him.

293
00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:44,864
Great. Josh, Fen,
the baby and I will go right now.

294
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,434
You know it doesn't work that way.

295
00:15:47,469 --> 00:15:51,571
Now, are you familiar with this?

296
00:15:51,606 --> 00:15:53,907
- No.
- But goddamn.

297
00:15:53,942 --> 00:15:55,842
Smells good.

298
00:15:55,877 --> 00:15:57,978
Even better to a god.

299
00:15:58,013 --> 00:16:01,348
It will draw Ember.

300
00:16:01,383 --> 00:16:03,516
Take it. Bake it into...

301
00:16:03,552 --> 00:16:06,353
I know this one. Little cakes.

302
00:16:06,388 --> 00:16:08,755
He loves little cakes.

303
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,890
Okay.

304
00:16:10,926 --> 00:16:12,625
Point the way back.

305
00:16:12,661 --> 00:16:14,527
Certainly.

306
00:16:14,563 --> 00:16:17,797
As soon as I've exacted the toll.

307
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,867
Travel from this world costs, dear.

308
00:16:20,902 --> 00:16:22,969
I don't make the rules.

309
00:16:23,005 --> 00:16:27,440
Oh, that's right. Yes, I do.

310
00:16:27,476 --> 00:16:30,343
We'll be seeing each
other soon I suspect.

311
00:16:38,687 --> 00:16:41,921
So, how's Alice?

312
00:16:41,957 --> 00:16:44,824
- Eliot, I...
- We need your help, Q.

313
00:16:46,061 --> 00:16:48,061
You gave her the no-secret-cutting shit

314
00:16:48,096 --> 00:16:49,562
- from the keg, right?
- Yes.

315
00:16:49,598 --> 00:16:51,097
Physically, she's perfectly safe,

316
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:54,734
but mentally... whew!

317
00:16:56,405 --> 00:16:58,371
What am I supposed to do?

318
00:17:09,851 --> 00:17:13,019
You know what you learn
when you're a High King?

319
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:17,624
Screwing up is inevitable,

320
00:17:17,659 --> 00:17:21,661
and there are some fuck ups
you can never un-fuck.

321
00:17:21,696 --> 00:17:23,830
It's infuriating
and it is heartbreaking, but...

322
00:17:23,865 --> 00:17:26,066
Think I destroyed her, Eliot.

323
00:17:26,101 --> 00:17:28,835
She made plenty of her
own choices along the way.

324
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:32,605
I'm not saying it doesn't suck.
I'm saying...

325
00:17:32,641 --> 00:17:34,808
Fillory needs you.

326
00:17:34,843 --> 00:17:38,344
You chose to be a king.
This is what that means.

327
00:17:41,783 --> 00:17:44,017
We have a plan, but...

328
00:17:45,754 --> 00:17:48,421
We need someone who
speaks fluent fanboy.

329
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:59,532
What on earth are you doing here,
sad little nerd king?

330
00:18:03,026 --> 00:18:05,128
You're sitting in my chair, asshole.

331
00:18:05,173 --> 00:18:06,239
Where the hell are the guards?

332
00:18:06,264 --> 00:18:07,430
Fast asleep, sorry.

333
00:18:07,465 --> 00:18:09,298
Watch where you point that thing.

334
00:18:09,703 --> 00:18:11,570
Dad.

335
00:18:11,605 --> 00:18:13,438
You're okay.

336
00:18:13,474 --> 00:18:15,874
I-I had to do this. You were a rat.

337
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,976
Could I have my throne back now?

338
00:18:18,012 --> 00:18:19,478
I'll fight if you want.

339
00:18:19,513 --> 00:18:21,146
I've become pretty
boss with a broadsword.

340
00:18:21,182 --> 00:18:23,582
You have...

341
00:18:23,617 --> 00:18:24,817
so don't.

342
00:18:25,786 --> 00:18:27,986
Fine.

343
00:18:32,493 --> 00:18:34,593
Always did like to storm out.

344
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:38,664
I should go too.

345
00:18:38,699 --> 00:18:41,567
I should be there for my people,
whatever happens.

346
00:18:41,602 --> 00:18:42,801
You mean in case I fail?

347
00:18:42,837 --> 00:18:44,136
You won't.

348
00:18:45,172 --> 00:18:46,939
Hmm.

349
00:18:46,974 --> 00:18:49,675
You know, since Ember banished me,

350
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:55,547
I wonder if that nullified
my whole Fillorian contract.

351
00:19:00,821 --> 00:19:02,721
We could check.

352
00:19:15,936 --> 00:19:20,072
Uh, okay, so the thing is,
this blank spot,

353
00:19:20,107 --> 00:19:22,040
it's coming up fast, and it lines up

354
00:19:22,076 --> 00:19:24,509
with everything that you
were saying about Ember.

355
00:19:24,545 --> 00:19:27,179
Is this tree too asymmetrical?

356
00:19:27,214 --> 00:19:30,616
It's nice. I...

357
00:19:32,586 --> 00:19:34,987
So there's no way that you would
want to help us, like, at all?

358
00:19:36,724 --> 00:19:41,994
One cannot just show up
after one's faked one's own death.

359
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:44,229
I'm sorry.

360
00:19:44,265 --> 00:19:46,632
The end of Fillory makes me sad as well.

361
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:49,801
So Fillory really is done?

362
00:19:49,837 --> 00:19:51,870
I like you.

363
00:19:51,906 --> 00:19:54,573
You care about things.

364
00:19:54,608 --> 00:19:57,276
Yeah, it's not really a trait
that's helped me much.

365
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:01,213
But it could be if it were applied
to not trying to fix the unfixable,

366
00:20:01,248 --> 00:20:06,051
but rather something
fresh and more perfect,

367
00:20:06,086 --> 00:20:08,086
like, say...

368
00:20:11,592 --> 00:20:15,761
Care to take a visit? Make some notes?

369
00:20:15,796 --> 00:20:17,629
- Um, I... uh...
- I'm sorry,

370
00:20:17,665 --> 00:20:19,564
but you're acting like I'm asking you,

371
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,701
whereas I am a god and
you are a hairless monkey,

372
00:20:22,736 --> 00:20:25,771
so nod and say thank you.

373
00:20:25,806 --> 00:20:27,272
All right.

374
00:20:27,308 --> 00:20:30,375
Let's go to the pocket world
formerly known as Cuba.

375
00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:47,726
Whoa!

376
00:20:47,761 --> 00:20:50,028
Coming back from the fairy world

377
00:20:50,064 --> 00:20:52,798
is a little rockier than getting there.

378
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,933
You don't fucking say.

379
00:20:54,969 --> 00:20:56,935
Are you okay?

380
00:21:01,408 --> 00:21:04,042
Jesus.

381
00:21:04,078 --> 00:21:07,679
Fen wouldn't come because
they have your daughter.

382
00:21:07,715 --> 00:21:09,748
I'm sorry.

383
00:21:09,783 --> 00:21:12,284
I'll keep trying.

384
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,353
I promise, El.

385
00:21:14,388 --> 00:21:17,990
First we need to deal
with that cock, Ember.

386
00:21:18,025 --> 00:21:22,227
We come bearing bait.

387
00:21:24,365 --> 00:21:27,799
I look like Jack Sparrow
if he were played by a man.

388
00:21:27,835 --> 00:21:31,837
I was actually thinking more
like a Fembot Nick Fury.

389
00:21:35,943 --> 00:21:38,043
- Look...
- No, I need to...

390
00:21:38,078 --> 00:21:40,012
I know, okay?

391
00:21:40,047 --> 00:21:44,883
I was angry... and scared
of what you were capable of,

392
00:21:44,918 --> 00:21:47,686
but you were doing your best
in an impossible position

393
00:21:47,721 --> 00:21:51,156
that would've crushed anyone,
myself included.

394
00:21:51,191 --> 00:21:53,291
Wait, is your good eye crying right now?

395
00:21:53,327 --> 00:21:55,927
No.

396
00:21:55,963 --> 00:21:57,963
Yes.

397
00:21:57,998 --> 00:22:00,799
And it's not my good eye,
it's my only fucking eye.

398
00:22:00,834 --> 00:22:03,268
- Eh...
- It's not funny,

399
00:22:03,303 --> 00:22:05,771
you dick, I'm a Cyclops!

400
00:22:05,806 --> 00:22:08,206
A mythological monster at last.

401
00:22:08,242 --> 00:22:10,342
Box... checked.

402
00:22:11,945 --> 00:22:13,445
We're trying too hard.

403
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:15,914
Pardon?

404
00:22:15,949 --> 00:22:18,283
To just blow past it and banter.

405
00:22:21,755 --> 00:22:24,756
It's not the same.
Let's not pretend it is, okay?

406
00:22:28,095 --> 00:22:29,961
That makes it hurt worse.

407
00:22:29,997 --> 00:22:32,431
I guess we'll just have
to live with the strain

408
00:22:32,466 --> 00:22:36,735
till the future reveals itself.

409
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:39,404
Meantime, that future
is going to be a big, blank,

410
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,841
post-apocalyptic nada unless
we do what we do best.

411
00:22:42,876 --> 00:22:47,012
Act out with a total lack of
empathy and impulse control?

412
00:22:47,047 --> 00:22:50,282
Party like the world depends on it,

413
00:22:50,317 --> 00:22:52,184
'cause Bambi One Eye...

414
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,150
it do.

415
00:23:15,234 --> 00:23:16,700
Oh, my God.

416
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,802
I threw better orgies when I was ten.

417
00:23:18,838 --> 00:23:21,305
I give you little cakes.

418
00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:26,210
I know they're irresistible,
it's the candied fairy hemp,

419
00:23:26,245 --> 00:23:29,947
but resist. This is
for our guest of honor.

420
00:23:51,771 --> 00:23:54,772
Be brutal.

421
00:23:56,142 --> 00:24:00,210
It's really... really linear.

422
00:24:20,433 --> 00:24:22,066
How's the linguini?

423
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:41,852
There's nothing wrong with it.

424
00:24:41,887 --> 00:24:43,220
Excellent.

425
00:24:43,255 --> 00:24:46,156
That's excellent.

426
00:24:46,192 --> 00:24:48,859
It's maybe a little, uh...

427
00:24:48,894 --> 00:24:49,893
Chewy?

428
00:24:49,929 --> 00:24:53,263
- Bland.
- Bland... good, or?

429
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:55,165
Bland is never really good or bad.

430
00:24:55,201 --> 00:24:56,433
It appeals to all tastes.

431
00:24:56,469 --> 00:24:58,836
Sure, but...

432
00:24:58,871 --> 00:25:01,105
usually people, uh...

433
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:04,908
creatures who can think, gods even...

434
00:25:04,944 --> 00:25:07,644
sometimes like the unknown,
the unexpected,

435
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,147
even the offensive.

436
00:25:10,182 --> 00:25:11,882
Little bit of, uh...

437
00:25:20,426 --> 00:25:21,892
Chaos.

438
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,144
Happy now?

439
00:25:40,179 --> 00:25:41,979
You know who would love this,

440
00:25:42,014 --> 00:25:47,317
who would create an entire
world out of this greasy stain?

441
00:25:47,353 --> 00:25:48,886
My brother.

442
00:25:48,921 --> 00:25:51,021
Yes, Ember would make a mess.

443
00:25:51,056 --> 00:25:53,290
Do not speak to me of Ember!

444
00:25:55,394 --> 00:25:58,762
I like you, boy, but I have a temper.

445
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:01,925
Wait, what about a human sacrifice?

446
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:04,161
No, unless the cakes are bad.

447
00:26:04,196 --> 00:26:05,663
Well, they smell great,

448
00:26:05,698 --> 00:26:07,097
but I don't think they're working, so...

449
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:09,867
Little cakes.

450
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:15,739
Mmm. Ohh. Mmm. Oh, oh.

451
00:26:15,775 --> 00:26:17,241
Oh, yes.

452
00:26:17,276 --> 00:26:20,844
Welcome, Ember, god of gods.

453
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,748
Wait, didn't I banish you?

454
00:26:24,784 --> 00:26:26,917
- You did, Lord of All, but...
- I didn't expect this.

455
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:29,019
- I can explain.
- I...

456
00:26:29,055 --> 00:26:30,254
love it!

457
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:31,288
- Ha.
- A genuine twist,

458
00:26:31,324 --> 00:26:32,956
a true surprise.

459
00:26:32,992 --> 00:26:34,925
When was the last time
that happened around here?

460
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,361
Exactly,
and we're really sorry about that.

461
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:40,931
We've fallen down on the job,
but boredom is death.

462
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:42,833
- I totally agree.
- Ugh, isn't it though?

463
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:44,201
- It is.
- Mm.

464
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:47,237
But... we can make Fillory more exciting

465
00:26:47,273 --> 00:26:50,674
and... and watchable than ever.

466
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,343
That's our pitch. It's a new chapter

467
00:26:52,378 --> 00:26:56,413
and the title is
"Shit Tons of Drama and Surprise."

468
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:58,916
Intriguing.

469
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,186
How?

470
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:03,854
Don't destroy Fillory.

471
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:05,789
Shake things up, yes.

472
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:06,890
Like the rats.

473
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:08,325
Yeah, rats, hilarious.

474
00:27:08,361 --> 00:27:10,027
It was good, wasn't it?

475
00:27:10,062 --> 00:27:11,195
- Yes. Yes.
- We're all still laughing.

476
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,363
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

477
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:13,664
- Right, laughing?
- Laughing!

478
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,204
There's so much more to do here,

479
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:23,140
so many twists and surprises
this world can offer.

480
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:25,275
- Mm.
- Think back to the moment

481
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:28,011
you created the first blades of grass.

482
00:27:28,047 --> 00:27:30,247
- Sentient trees.
- Talking animals.

483
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:31,749
- The Wellspring.
- Think back

484
00:27:31,784 --> 00:27:35,085
to what you built with
your brother Umber.

485
00:27:35,121 --> 00:27:38,455
My brother, rest his soul,
was nothing but a simpering,

486
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:41,725
sniping, anal retentive critic,
as well as a...

487
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:45,028
Greedy, promiscuous, selfish,

488
00:27:45,064 --> 00:27:48,799
credit-hogging, mouse-eating slob!

489
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:50,051
Any talk of this is mere whimsy,

490
00:27:50,052 --> 00:27:52,403
and it's whimsy itself that I
am tired of and finished with.

491
00:27:52,438 --> 00:27:55,906
We get it, we do. I mean,
try ruling a world of whimsy.

492
00:27:55,941 --> 00:27:57,040
- Am I right?
- Mm.

493
00:27:57,076 --> 00:27:58,876
Not so whimsical, actually.

494
00:27:58,911 --> 00:28:00,911
Well, then, let's get it over with.

495
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:02,446
Why wait?

496
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:04,248
Let's start right now.

497
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:05,749
No, no, no, no, no, no!

498
00:28:05,785 --> 00:28:07,217
Not what we meant...

499
00:28:07,253 --> 00:28:10,721
Rewind! Rewind! Rewind! Rewind! Rewind!

500
00:28:14,427 --> 00:28:16,226
Stop! Are you insane?

501
00:28:16,262 --> 00:28:19,029
No! I mean, we meant...
make it better, make it better.

502
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:21,899
Less whimsical, more...
meaner maybe, more you.

503
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:24,001
Maybe, if I didn't have to do it alone.

504
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:26,470
Say what you will about my dear,
departed brother,

505
00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:28,939
but he was a demon for overwork.

506
00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:30,374
Hmm. He had a strange love for this...

507
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:32,476
Poor, accursed place.

508
00:28:32,511 --> 00:28:34,711
Too late to be helped now. I...

509
00:28:34,747 --> 00:28:36,847
couldn't bear to go back. I-I won't.

510
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,081
I won't.

511
00:28:38,117 --> 00:28:40,484
Um, actually, we're already there.

512
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:42,319
Where?

513
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:44,988
Apocalypse! Apocalypse! Apocalypse!

514
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:47,991
Isn't it wonderful?

515
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:53,897
What are you doing?

516
00:28:53,933 --> 00:28:55,799
You're making a mess!

517
00:29:04,176 --> 00:29:06,710
I'm...

518
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,245
back.

519
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,180
You're alive.

520
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:14,985
How is this possible, brother?

521
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:19,223
You died battling Martin to save me.

522
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:24,161
Why are you afraid? I...

523
00:29:24,196 --> 00:29:27,464
I am... so pleased.

524
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:36,073
Martin told me you died...

525
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,541
when he banished me.

526
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:39,443
Hey, guys, how about a hug?

527
00:29:39,478 --> 00:29:41,311
This is a family reunion.

528
00:29:41,347 --> 00:29:43,013
This was a family betrayal.

529
00:29:44,231 --> 00:29:44,982
Wasn't it?

530
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:49,553
- Wasn't it?
- No!

531
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:51,188
No!

532
00:29:51,223 --> 00:29:52,389
I can't be here!

533
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:54,791
Oh! All this time, I thought,

534
00:29:54,827 --> 00:29:59,329
"Martin, so powerful."

535
00:29:59,365 --> 00:30:01,231
But no.

536
00:30:01,267 --> 00:30:05,469
He was merely a brilliant dealmaker.

537
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:10,607
My banishment for your life.

538
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:14,278
Your puny, petty,

539
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:18,282
putrid nothing of a soul spark!

540
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:24,655
Brother, please?

541
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:28,225
Please!

542
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,327
You... always... were

543
00:30:30,362 --> 00:30:31,862
the weak one.

544
00:30:52,418 --> 00:30:54,418
Come and get me, you fucking baby.

545
00:30:56,155 --> 00:30:57,588
You want to know why you're so bored?

546
00:30:57,623 --> 00:31:00,290
Because you're too stupid to get it.

547
00:31:00,326 --> 00:31:03,293
You're too spoiled and
entitled to understand...

548
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:06,330
How dare you? I am a god.

549
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:09,032
Are you? Really?

550
00:31:09,068 --> 00:31:10,667
I'm not impressed.

551
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:14,271
I've met scary gods, and you?

552
00:31:14,306 --> 00:31:17,007
You're nothing but a petty tyrant.

553
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:27,517
Quentin...

554
00:31:28,621 --> 00:31:31,989
You... always...

555
00:31:32,024 --> 00:31:33,156
surprise.

556
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:48,505
Holy fuck.

557
00:31:50,209 --> 00:31:51,870
Q?

558
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:55,646
I think you just saved the whole world.

559
00:32:10,199 --> 00:32:13,575
We are officially a land
of godless heathens,

560
00:32:13,611 --> 00:32:17,379
making today the first day
of our societal adulthood.

561
00:32:17,414 --> 00:32:21,683
I, for one, am slightly terrified
and equally excited.

562
00:32:21,719 --> 00:32:23,519
And trying not to break into "Hamilton."

563
00:32:23,554 --> 00:32:26,722
And so, I turn over the
next phase of our maturation

564
00:32:26,757 --> 00:32:28,924
to our High Queen Margo.

565
00:32:28,959 --> 00:32:31,059
We need a constitution.

566
00:32:31,095 --> 00:32:31,861
Pardon?

567
00:32:31,862 --> 00:32:35,998
These are some pretty good ones here,
so let's rip off the best parts.

568
00:32:47,878 --> 00:32:49,878
Hungry?

569
00:32:51,582 --> 00:32:56,752
I know Mayakovsky said soft,
bland food for a while, but...

570
00:32:56,787 --> 00:33:00,622
I can see that's not really working.

571
00:33:00,658 --> 00:33:03,559
So I stopped by the farm

572
00:33:03,594 --> 00:33:07,863
where Fogg gets his
weekly rasher of bacon.

573
00:33:07,898 --> 00:33:09,031
No thanks.

574
00:33:09,066 --> 00:33:11,099
You sure?

575
00:33:11,135 --> 00:33:13,035
Because...

576
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:15,771
I tried it...

577
00:33:15,806 --> 00:33:19,214
and, uh,

578
00:33:19,349 --> 00:33:21,349
it's amazing.

579
00:33:22,785 --> 00:33:25,386
I know what you're trying to do.

580
00:33:25,506 --> 00:33:30,309
I'm... just trying to do
breakfast food, that's all.

581
00:33:37,528 --> 00:33:39,929
Oh, fuck you.

582
00:33:41,945 --> 00:33:44,246
Mmm.

583
00:33:44,327 --> 00:33:45,827
Please.

584
00:33:51,876 --> 00:33:53,067
Fuck.

585
00:33:53,477 --> 00:33:55,215
Gluttony.

586
00:33:56,013 --> 00:33:58,480
It's an excellent part of being human.

587
00:34:00,151 --> 00:34:02,851
I don't remember many others.

588
00:34:02,887 --> 00:34:04,019
Really?

589
00:34:06,824 --> 00:34:08,390
Ugh.

590
00:34:10,394 --> 00:34:13,662
Hmm, my hands are all greasy.

591
00:34:13,697 --> 00:34:15,631
Ugh.

592
00:34:15,666 --> 00:34:19,735
With every good thing,
no matter how small it is,

593
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:22,070
it's always...

594
00:34:22,106 --> 00:34:25,741
married to something
so completely disgusting.

595
00:34:25,776 --> 00:34:27,876
You can't escape it.

596
00:34:27,912 --> 00:34:29,745
You're right.

597
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,748
It's gross. We are animals.

598
00:34:50,568 --> 00:34:52,734
Why does that feel so good?

599
00:34:58,542 --> 00:35:01,543
I don't know.

600
00:35:01,579 --> 00:35:04,913
It just does.

601
00:35:04,949 --> 00:35:07,583
It always did.

602
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:21,563
Hmm.

603
00:35:43,921 --> 00:35:47,089
Look... I need your help.

604
00:36:08,812 --> 00:36:10,145
I'm not gonna beg.

605
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,714
I'm not gonna use guilt,
I have no leverage.

606
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,817
But Penny's in the Library.
He can be your mole.

607
00:36:15,853 --> 00:36:18,120
But to do that, he'd have to be alive.

608
00:36:23,827 --> 00:36:26,061
He'd never know.

609
00:36:26,096 --> 00:36:27,930
Whatever you need, ask me about it.

610
00:36:27,965 --> 00:36:30,098
He tells me, I tell you.

611
00:36:34,571 --> 00:36:37,172
Who saved her man's life, so maybe not.

612
00:36:37,207 --> 00:36:39,074
Big picture, right?

613
00:36:40,678 --> 00:36:41,877
Deal?

614
00:36:44,181 --> 00:36:46,181
Deal.

615
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:54,222
I probably shouldn't say this
out loud, but...

616
00:36:54,258 --> 00:36:57,826
this was kind of an okay day.

617
00:36:57,861 --> 00:36:59,761
Are you bragging?

618
00:36:59,797 --> 00:37:01,797
No.

619
00:37:03,267 --> 00:37:05,600
Kind of.

620
00:37:05,636 --> 00:37:08,637
Not about this... entirely.

621
00:37:11,175 --> 00:37:14,109
I also kind of killed a god.

622
00:37:14,144 --> 00:37:18,981
Huh. Hilarious.

623
00:37:19,016 --> 00:37:21,616
No, seriously.

624
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:23,852
Ember.

625
00:37:26,056 --> 00:37:30,592
I mean, he was...
erasing the whole thing.

626
00:37:30,627 --> 00:37:33,762
Wait, wait, you can't be serious.

627
00:37:33,797 --> 00:37:34,997
Yeah.

628
00:37:35,032 --> 00:37:36,865
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

629
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,134
No, I didn't want to.
He had just killed his brother.

630
00:37:39,169 --> 00:37:42,871
He was going after Julia.
He was genocidally insane.

631
00:37:42,906 --> 00:37:45,040
You don't get it.

632
00:37:45,075 --> 00:37:46,308
Jesus.

633
00:37:46,343 --> 00:37:48,710
When I was a-a niffin, I saw things.

634
00:37:48,746 --> 00:37:50,812
I saw everything from
the beginning of time.

635
00:37:50,848 --> 00:37:52,314
- Calm down...
- No, I understand

636
00:37:52,349 --> 00:37:54,082
the way the universe works, Q,

637
00:37:54,118 --> 00:37:57,619
the Wellspring,
the hierarchies, the plumbing.

638
00:37:57,654 --> 00:38:00,022
I was inside it.

639
00:38:00,057 --> 00:38:04,226
Gods like Ember have parents, you idiot!

640
00:38:04,261 --> 00:38:05,727
I-I'm not following.

641
00:38:05,763 --> 00:38:07,896
The old gods,
the creators of the universe,

642
00:38:07,931 --> 00:38:09,931
of all magic itself.

643
00:38:09,967 --> 00:38:12,200
To Ember, we're like... we're like toys,

644
00:38:12,236 --> 00:38:14,836
but to them we're... we're cells.

645
00:38:14,872 --> 00:38:16,238
When we're harmless they ignore us,

646
00:38:16,273 --> 00:38:19,141
but when we become malignant,
they amputate.

647
00:38:19,176 --> 00:38:20,942
Now, if you're gonna use
stones like this,

648
00:38:20,978 --> 00:38:22,244
it's imperative that...

649
00:38:23,914 --> 00:38:26,081
Excuse me.

650
00:38:26,116 --> 00:38:27,849
Excuse me, this is...

651
00:38:28,577 --> 00:38:32,287
Okay, wait.
Like, so there's an actual plumber?

652
00:38:32,322 --> 00:38:34,856
Like the Mario Brother of the gods?

653
00:38:34,892 --> 00:38:36,224
- Yes.
- And he can just...

654
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,093
I guarantee you, he's doing it.

655
00:38:47,938 --> 00:38:49,838
Attention, please keep calm

656
00:38:49,873 --> 00:38:52,074
and follow all code green procedures.

657
00:38:52,109 --> 00:38:55,077
Please remember not to
interact and simply gather...

658
00:38:59,016 --> 00:39:01,616
Attention,
please keep calm and follow...

659
00:39:19,236 --> 00:39:20,669
Professor?

660
00:39:20,704 --> 00:39:23,004
Mayakovsky!

661
00:39:30,314 --> 00:39:32,314
Holy shit.

662
00:39:40,021 --> 00:39:43,524
All right, everyone,
open your books to chapter 16.

663
00:40:02,745 --> 00:40:06,680
Who can translate the Borkulo Rendering

664
00:40:06,716 --> 00:40:08,816
from its original Hungarian?

665
00:40:10,052 --> 00:40:12,753
No point in raising hands.

666
00:40:12,788 --> 00:40:14,388
Remember?

667
00:40:15,892 --> 00:40:16,924
I can.

668
00:40:16,959 --> 00:40:19,026
Dean Fogg? Sorry to interrupt.

669
00:40:19,061 --> 00:40:21,162
Yes, Josh, go ahead.

670
00:40:21,197 --> 00:40:22,796
Well, I was online last night...

671
00:40:22,832 --> 00:40:25,232
The answer is no.

672
00:40:25,268 --> 00:40:27,701
There is no actual evidence

673
00:40:27,737 --> 00:40:31,372
of a magical surge in Sedona, Arizona.

674
00:40:31,407 --> 00:40:32,373
Yeah, but what about in...

675
00:40:32,408 --> 00:40:33,874
Or Kenya,

676
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:37,645
or Machu Picchu, or China...

677
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,280
or anywhere.

678
00:40:41,851 --> 00:40:44,351
Magic is gone.

679
00:40:44,387 --> 00:40:46,387
The best we can do is accept that,

680
00:40:46,422 --> 00:40:48,789
and continue our theoretical studies,

681
00:40:48,824 --> 00:40:51,926
to stay ready for its return.

682
00:40:51,961 --> 00:40:53,928
So you think that's possible?

683
00:40:53,963 --> 00:40:56,163
Anything is possible, Alice.

684
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:58,098
Was, anyway.

685
00:41:01,404 --> 00:41:03,704
Look at you,

686
00:41:03,739 --> 00:41:07,074
playing the part of the bright,
young girl.

687
00:41:07,109 --> 00:41:08,375
Joseph?

688
00:41:10,379 --> 00:41:12,846
Ah, yes.

689
00:41:12,882 --> 00:41:15,916
I can see my Alice in there still.

690
00:41:15,952 --> 00:41:17,151
Good.

691
00:41:19,689 --> 00:41:21,055
Are you all right?

692
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:24,225
I am as I appear... dying.

693
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:27,127
So it is true.

694
00:41:27,163 --> 00:41:28,729
Magic's gone everywhere.

695
00:41:28,764 --> 00:41:33,434
The creatures, cryptids,
sylphs, dragons, unicorns,

696
00:41:33,469 --> 00:41:38,005
even the pointless vampires
are all as they were.

697
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:42,042
But those of us who drew on
the power of the Wellspring,

698
00:41:42,078 --> 00:41:45,179
well, as you can see...

699
00:41:45,214 --> 00:41:47,147
- I want to help.
- I'm here, Alice,

700
00:41:47,183 --> 00:41:49,283
because it is you who needs help.

701
00:41:49,318 --> 00:41:53,087
- What?
- As a niffin, you made enemies.

702
00:41:53,122 --> 00:41:56,257
I'm here to warn you that
one of them seeks you.

703
00:41:56,292 --> 00:41:57,358
Who?

704
00:41:57,393 --> 00:41:58,926
The Lamprey.

705
00:41:58,961 --> 00:42:03,230
You do recall what
you did to his family?

706
00:42:03,266 --> 00:42:04,164
Yes.

707
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,899
Most amusing at the time,

708
00:42:05,935 --> 00:42:09,370
but to The Lamprey, cause for vengeance.

709
00:42:09,405 --> 00:42:13,140
It knows you're weak.
It knows you're here.

710
00:42:17,747 --> 00:42:19,913
What do I...

711
00:42:19,949 --> 00:42:21,482
Oh...

712
00:42:25,154 --> 00:42:28,822
Democracy has to take a backseat.

713
00:42:28,858 --> 00:42:32,860
Without magic, the people are terrified,

714
00:42:32,895 --> 00:42:35,329
and that is just one step
from an angry mob.

715
00:42:35,364 --> 00:42:37,398
And that's how royal heads
end up in baskets.

716
00:42:37,433 --> 00:42:39,500
I get it. I get it.

717
00:42:39,535 --> 00:42:45,939
This is an undereducated,
pre-industrial populous, Eliot.

718
00:42:45,975 --> 00:42:47,541
They need to be ruled.

719
00:42:47,576 --> 00:42:50,878
They need to be inspired.

720
00:42:50,913 --> 00:42:53,180
They need to think
they're being inspired

721
00:42:53,215 --> 00:42:55,049
as they're being ruled.

722
00:42:55,084 --> 00:42:58,986
I'm talking curfew,
martial law, conscription,

723
00:42:59,021 --> 00:43:00,954
and severe and public punishment.

724
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:03,490
Okay. Can we maybe make our way

725
00:43:03,526 --> 00:43:05,726
to King and Queen Caligula, please?
Maybe a...

726
00:43:05,761 --> 00:43:08,295
How do you not recognize me?
I'm the King's wife!

727
00:43:08,331 --> 00:43:10,030
- Tell them!
- Oh, my God.

728
00:43:15,204 --> 00:43:16,837
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

729
00:43:16,872 --> 00:43:19,373
How did you get here?

730
00:43:19,408 --> 00:43:21,141
Simple.

731
00:43:21,177 --> 00:43:23,043
I just gave them my toes.

732
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:25,446
Gave... who your toes?

733
00:43:25,481 --> 00:43:27,114
The fairies.

734
00:43:29,085 --> 00:43:31,051
I wanted to stay...

735
00:43:31,087 --> 00:43:35,522
to be close to our daughter,
but I had to warn you.

736
00:43:35,558 --> 00:43:36,957
They're coming.

737
00:43:39,195 --> 00:43:40,994
They're here.

738
00:44:23,973 --> 00:44:25,172
Boo.

739
00:44:26,475 --> 00:44:27,374
Hey.

740
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:28,542
Hey.

741
00:44:28,577 --> 00:44:30,043
Jules, I...

742
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,378
Hi.

743
00:44:34,116 --> 00:44:36,183
How did you get in here?

744
00:44:36,218 --> 00:44:40,020
Well, your...
your fence is a little shoddy.

745
00:44:40,055 --> 00:44:42,256
Right.

746
00:44:42,291 --> 00:44:44,992
Welcome to the new normal.

747
00:44:45,027 --> 00:44:48,218
You know, 'cause I killed
all magic fucking everywhere.

748
00:44:48,243 --> 00:44:50,931
Uh... Sorry.

749
00:44:50,966 --> 00:44:53,345
That was definitely a two-hander.

750
00:44:54,126 --> 00:44:56,203
I'll be burning in hell
right next to you,

751
00:44:56,238 --> 00:44:58,338
but hey, at least we have each other.

752
00:44:58,374 --> 00:45:01,308
Hmm.

753
00:45:01,343 --> 00:45:04,244
So how are you?

754
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,913
Fine.

755
00:45:05,948 --> 00:45:09,216
- Listen...
- How's law school?

756
00:45:09,251 --> 00:45:10,317
I quit.

757
00:45:10,352 --> 00:45:12,519
Okay.

758
00:45:12,555 --> 00:45:15,322
Why?

759
00:45:15,357 --> 00:45:20,127
Because I need to show you something,

760
00:45:20,162 --> 00:45:23,997
and you need to promise me that
you're not going to tell anyone,

761
00:45:24,033 --> 00:45:26,600
'cause you're the only
person that I trust.

762
00:45:28,637 --> 00:45:30,304
I promise.

763
00:45:36,245 --> 00:45:37,411
Jules, it's not gonna work.

764
00:45:37,446 --> 00:45:40,247
Just give me a second.

765
00:45:40,282 --> 00:45:41,515
We all get flashes

766
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:43,050
that we can do it again, but it's...

767
00:45:45,154 --> 00:45:47,554
Oh, my God.

768
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:50,424
How?

769
00:45:50,459 --> 00:45:53,074
I have no idea.
