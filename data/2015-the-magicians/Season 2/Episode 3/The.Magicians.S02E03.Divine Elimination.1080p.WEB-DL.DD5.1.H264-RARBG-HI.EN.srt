3
00:00:05,115 --> 00:00:07,408
Zillion bucks says The
Beast comes back any minute,

4
00:00:07,455 --> 00:00:08,346
so what's the plan?

5
00:00:08,385 --> 00:00:09,265
<i>Okay, so here's the thing.</i>

6
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,869
<i>I can't really touch the knife.</i>

7
00:00:10,908 --> 00:00:12,133
<i>We need the power of a God.</i>

8
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,533
I have gifted you my
Bestowal. Imbibe it.

9
00:00:15,688 --> 00:00:17,962
The more it burns,
the less time we have.

10
00:00:18,096 --> 00:00:19,947
There's a spell that
seems strong enough.

11
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,071
These are my students.

12
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,969
They are in need of the Rhinemann Ultra.

13
00:00:22,994 --> 00:00:26,272
<i>No one but you can be
within 20 feet of the blast.</i>

14
00:00:26,604 --> 00:00:28,737

just a few minutes</i>

15
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:29,860
<i>to fully power up.</i>

16
00:00:29,885 --> 00:00:31,177
This is a cacodemon.

17
00:00:31,224 --> 00:00:32,253
It'll grow much bigger.

18
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,043
Unleash these, and believe me,

19
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,985
they'll keep The Beast plenty busy.

20
00:00:36,032 --> 00:00:37,286
<i>[no audible dialogue]</i>

21
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:39,589

<i>Please... fix...</i>

25
00:00:46,658 --> 00:00:47,746
my hands.

26
00:00:47,793 --> 00:00:50,081
<i>Go... fuck... yourself?</i>

27
00:00:50,128 --> 00:00:51,458
I think I can help.

28
00:00:51,505 --> 00:00:53,556
- Wow.
- I owe you for real.

29
00:00:53,658 --> 00:00:55,931
You could die if you don't
get clear of The Beast.

30
00:00:56,002 --> 00:00:57,494
You think I don't know
how dangerous he is?

31
00:00:57,518 --> 00:00:59,197
No. Not him. Us.

32
00:00:59,237 --> 00:01:00,692
Yeah, do what you want with him,

33
00:01:00,746 --> 00:01:01,744
but not until I get Reynard.

34
00:01:01,769 --> 00:01:03,170
We can't merely summon him.

35
00:01:03,217 --> 00:01:04,963
A God can resist.

36
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,740
I don't give a shit about getting him.

37
00:01:06,787 --> 00:01:08,439
- You should.
- I didn't summon him.

38
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:10,268
<i>I didn't get raped by him.</i>

39
00:01:10,315 --> 00:01:11,378
I have no skin in this.

40
00:01:11,425 --> 00:01:13,282
Reynard is targeting hedges.

41
00:01:14,331 --> 00:01:16,184
[all coughing]

42
00:01:16,254 --> 00:01:18,518
Did you put some kind
of curse on the castle?

43
00:01:18,565 --> 00:01:20,123
Did I?

44
00:01:21,026 --> 00:01:23,023
The spell that won World War II

45
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,299
is called the Rhinemann Ultra?

46
00:01:25,346 --> 00:01:26,885
Sounds like a not-so-great beer.

47
00:01:26,932 --> 00:01:28,810
Fine, it's a beer, but
it's a beer that we can use

48
00:01:28,834 --> 00:01:30,720
- to kill The Beast.
- Meanwhile, Penny comes back

49
00:01:30,744 --> 00:01:32,824
with cool circa-1985 wrist chains.

50
00:01:32,871 --> 00:01:34,859
Yeah, super cool how they
keep me from killing myself.

51
00:01:34,883 --> 00:01:36,960
And then Dean Fogg gives you
all matching tramp stamps?

52
00:01:36,984 --> 00:01:38,296
I thought tramp stamps

53
00:01:38,343 --> 00:01:39,998
were supposed to be on our lower back?

54
00:01:40,045 --> 00:01:41,965
God, I feel like I missed
out on some crazy party

55
00:01:41,989 --> 00:01:43,967
you'll be talking about
for the rest of your lives.

56
00:01:43,991 --> 00:01:46,393
Say what you want, but we
brought back weapons and a plan.

57
00:01:46,448 --> 00:01:48,751
What do you have to show for yourself?

58
00:01:51,995 --> 00:01:57,794
Ta... fucking... da.

59
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,794
Your royal accoutrement.

60
00:02:00,841 --> 00:02:03,688
<i>This</i> is ceremony, people,

61
00:02:03,735 --> 00:02:06,992
and I expect you to
slather yourselves in it.

62
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:08,039
Thank you, Eliot.

63
00:02:08,082 --> 00:02:10,662
I missed you all.

64
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:12,475
And I was bored.

65
00:02:12,555 --> 00:02:13,898
Come. Sit.

66
00:02:13,945 --> 00:02:16,049
Wait, is this really
the most important thing

67
00:02:16,112 --> 00:02:17,310
we could be doing right now?

68
00:02:17,357 --> 00:02:20,244
I mean, The Beast is still out there
waiting for us...

69
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:21,745
The Beast can wait for five minutes.

70
00:02:21,831 --> 00:02:24,612
You are all Kings and Queens of Fillory.

71
00:02:24,706 --> 00:02:26,401
Well, almost all of you.

72
00:02:26,448 --> 00:02:31,221
Just revel in your majesty
for one fucking second.

73
00:02:31,268 --> 00:02:33,736
Be regal, miscreants.

74
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,791
Mm.

75
00:02:39,898 --> 00:02:42,083
You're such a stupid, stupid, man.

76
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,694
I'm gonna kill you in your sleep.

77
00:02:43,741 --> 00:02:46,129
[indistinct whispering]

78
00:02:46,176 --> 00:02:48,732
El... El... El, you okay?

79
00:02:48,779 --> 00:02:50,792
Totally fine, why?

80
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:51,927
It's just...

81
00:02:51,974 --> 00:02:53,259
you went away there for a minute.

82
00:02:53,283 --> 00:02:55,842
Nonsense. I feel great.

83
00:02:55,913 --> 00:02:57,303
Have a seat.

84
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,334
I'm kind of on a clock here,

85
00:02:59,381 --> 00:03:01,269
so we should talk strategy.

86
00:03:01,316 --> 00:03:02,402
Yeah, we already talked strategy,

87
00:03:02,426 --> 00:03:03,706
so we just need to catch you up.

88
00:03:03,752 --> 00:03:04,871
You've been planning without me?

89
00:03:04,895 --> 00:03:06,374
Yeah... when we were on Earth.

90
00:03:06,421 --> 00:03:07,752
What did you think we were doing?

91
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:09,617
[laughing]

92
00:03:13,395 --> 00:03:14,914
Eliot, we're not trying to exclude you.

93
00:03:14,938 --> 00:03:16,735
You just weren't there.

94
00:03:16,782 --> 00:03:19,460
No. No, I wasn't, was I?

95
00:03:20,202 --> 00:03:22,265
Don't think I don't see how this works.

96
00:03:22,312 --> 00:03:24,663
You disappear. You come back.

97
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,504
Matching tattoos, and now
you're three against one.

98
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:29,539
I know exactly what you're planning.

99
00:03:29,586 --> 00:03:31,966
- Don't touch me.
- Sweetie?

100
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:34,344
You kind of sound insane.

101
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:35,935
Do I?

102
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:42,019
Because I promise you...
I will not go down easily.

103
00:03:42,066 --> 00:03:44,021
Oo-surpers.

104
00:03:45,887 --> 00:03:48,340
Usurpers. [sighs]

105
00:03:48,387 --> 00:03:50,894
Whichever way you're
supposed to pronounce it.

106
00:03:50,941 --> 00:03:52,387
What just happened?

107
00:03:52,434 --> 00:03:54,984
He got like this on shrooms once.

108
00:03:55,031 --> 00:03:57,136
I'll go talk to him.

109
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,191
[sighs]

110
00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:05,667
<i>I just remembered
something that Julia said,</i>

111
00:04:05,714 --> 00:04:07,294
and it's starting to
make a lot of sense.

112
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:08,979
- You talked to that bitch?
- Yes, he did.

113
00:04:09,026 --> 00:04:11,214
It was a warning.
Something The Beast said.

114
00:04:11,261 --> 00:04:14,209
Uh... God, of course. It makes sense.

115
00:04:14,256 --> 00:04:16,173
I mean, he'd want to
booby-trap his kingdom, right?

116
00:04:16,197 --> 00:04:20,460
So apparently, he left curses behind.

117
00:04:20,514 --> 00:04:22,467
Here, actually.

118
00:04:22,514 --> 00:04:24,494
So you think Eliot might be cursed?

119
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:26,666
I mean, she was vague, but I mean...

120
00:04:28,506 --> 00:04:29,599
Did either of you notice

121
00:04:29,646 --> 00:04:31,468
that Eliot started acting strangely

122
00:04:31,515 --> 00:04:34,164
once he took a drink from the goblet?

123
00:04:34,702 --> 00:04:39,245
I mean, it could be poison or a potion.

124
00:04:41,499 --> 00:04:44,572
All right, well, we probably shouldn't
drink from ours just to be safe.

125
00:04:44,619 --> 00:04:45,830
Or maybe it was just some primo

126
00:04:45,854 --> 00:04:47,334
Fillorian shit that went up his nose,

127
00:04:47,364 --> 00:04:49,034
and he's on the bad end of a trip

128
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:51,078
because he's him.

129
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,357
Did something happen to you?

130
00:04:54,404 --> 00:04:56,562
Nope. Nothing.

131
00:04:56,647 --> 00:04:59,117
I'm fine... Penny.

132
00:05:04,475 --> 00:05:07,128
Wait. And now you're doing it.

133
00:05:07,175 --> 00:05:08,607
I don't know what you're talking about.

134
00:05:08,631 --> 00:05:09,831
I mean like Eliot.

135
00:05:09,878 --> 00:05:11,484
You're acting all tweaky and shit.

136
00:05:11,531 --> 00:05:13,295
[both]: We're fine.

137
00:05:13,676 --> 00:05:15,098
Clearly.

138
00:05:15,145 --> 00:05:18,304
Look, I think we can all agree
that we have a problem here.

139
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:19,803
Eliot.

140
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,539
He's High King. He's cursed.

141
00:05:23,586 --> 00:05:27,093
- We have no choice but...
- We have to kill him.

142
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,661
Exactly.

143
00:05:28,789 --> 00:05:30,424
The thrones.

144
00:05:31,196 --> 00:05:32,738
They're both cursed.

145
00:05:32,785 --> 00:05:35,757
This is hard for you. I get that.

146
00:05:35,804 --> 00:05:37,300
It's hard for us too.

147
00:05:37,347 --> 00:05:39,086
But it must be done.

148
00:05:40,467 --> 00:05:42,461
[both]: For Fillory.

149
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,310
But don't tell Quentin...

150
00:05:51,357 --> 00:05:53,383
I'm going to have to kill him too.

151
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,398
Right after Margo.

152
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,773
Margo?

153
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:08,755
Margo.

154
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:11,891
Margo. Margo. Margo.
We got a serious problem, okay?

155
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,328
I know. Eliot's cursed.

156
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:15,405
No, no. Not just Eliot.
Alice and Quentin too.

157
00:06:15,452 --> 00:06:18,275
Listen, whatever you do, do
not sit on your throne, okay?

158
00:06:18,322 --> 00:06:21,569
Fine. Whatevs. I have a plan.

159
00:06:21,616 --> 00:06:22,971
You gonna help me pick these?

160
00:06:23,018 --> 00:06:24,214
What's this? An antidote?

161
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:25,682
Exactly. For the poison.

162
00:06:25,729 --> 00:06:27,397
For the... what?

163
00:06:28,114 --> 00:06:29,786
For the poison.

164
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:33,280
I have to drink it first, or
I won't get Eliot to take it.

165
00:06:34,356 --> 00:06:38,052
Jesus. You're acting like
this is your first regicide.

166
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:40,530
Also, it's not the
thrones that are cursed.

167
00:06:40,577 --> 00:06:43,125
I sat on mine, and I'm totally fine.

168
00:06:43,172 --> 00:06:44,741
You sat on your...

169
00:06:45,073 --> 00:06:46,261
Fuck...

170
00:06:46,308 --> 00:06:47,804
Great. No, it's good.

171
00:06:47,851 --> 00:06:49,622
- Okay.
- Stop.

172
00:06:49,669 --> 00:06:50,789
This'll be over soon.

173
00:06:50,836 --> 00:06:54,213
I'll deal with Eliot and Alice and Q.

174
00:06:54,466 --> 00:06:56,061
You're welcome.

175
00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:00,775
