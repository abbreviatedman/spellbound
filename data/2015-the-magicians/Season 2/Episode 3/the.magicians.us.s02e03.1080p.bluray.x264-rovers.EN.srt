1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,007
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,490
Zillion bucks says The
Beast comes back any minute,

3
00:00:07,515 --> 00:00:08,498
so what's the plan?

4
00:00:08,523 --> 00:00:09,295
Okay, so here's the thing.

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,796
I can't really touch the knife.

6
00:00:10,867 --> 00:00:12,187
We need the power of a God.

7
00:00:12,242 --> 00:00:15,718
I have gifted you my
Bestowal. Imbibe it.

8
00:00:15,803 --> 00:00:18,101
The more it burns,
the less time we have.

9
00:00:18,312 --> 00:00:19,740
There's a spell that
seems strong enough.

10
00:00:19,776 --> 00:00:20,975
These are my students.

11
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:22,743
They are in need of the Rhinemann Ultra.

12
00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:26,414
No one but you can be
within 20 feet of the blast.

13
00:00:26,763 --> 00:00:28,482
Alice is going to take
just a few minutes

14
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:29,650
to fully power up.

15
00:00:29,685 --> 00:00:31,318
This is a cacodemon.

16
00:00:31,354 --> 00:00:32,354
It'll grow much bigger.

17
00:00:32,388 --> 00:00:33,821
Unleash these, and believe me,

18
00:00:33,856 --> 00:00:35,723
they'll keep The Beast plenty busy.

19
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:39,326
- Do you know what a Niffin is?
- No.

20
00:00:39,362 --> 00:00:42,096
It's when too much runs through you.

21
00:00:42,131 --> 00:00:44,265
Only the magic is left.

22
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,467
Please... fix...

23
00:00:46,502 --> 00:00:47,601
my hands.

24
00:00:47,637 --> 00:00:49,937
Go... fuck... yourself?

25
00:00:49,972 --> 00:00:51,272
I think I can help.

26
00:00:51,307 --> 00:00:53,541
- Wow.
- I owe you for real.

27
00:00:53,576 --> 00:00:55,454
You could die if you don't
get clear of The Beast.

28
00:00:55,478 --> 00:00:57,278
You think I don't know
how dangerous he is?

29
00:00:57,313 --> 00:00:59,046
No. Not him. Us.

30
00:00:59,081 --> 00:01:00,548
Yeah, do what you want with him,

31
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:01,693
but not until I get Reynard.

32
00:01:01,717 --> 00:01:02,983
We can't merely summon him.

33
00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:04,819
A God can resist.

34
00:01:04,854 --> 00:01:06,554
I don't give a shit about getting him.

35
00:01:06,589 --> 00:01:08,389
- You should.
- I didn't summon him.

36
00:01:08,424 --> 00:01:10,124
I didn't get raped by him.

37
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,192
I have no skin in this.

38
00:01:11,227 --> 00:01:12,726
Reynard is targeting hedges.

39
00:01:16,098 --> 00:01:18,332
Did you put some kind
of curse on the castle?

40
00:01:18,367 --> 00:01:19,567
Did I?

41
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:22,837
The spell that won World War II

42
00:01:22,872 --> 00:01:24,972
is called the Rhinemann Ultra?

43
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,740
Sounds like a not-so-great beer.

44
00:01:26,776 --> 00:01:28,654
Fine, it's a beer, but
it's a beer that we can use

45
00:01:28,678 --> 00:01:30,522
- to kill The Beast.
- Meanwhile, Penny comes back

46
00:01:30,546 --> 00:01:32,680
with cool circa-1985 wrist chains.

47
00:01:32,715 --> 00:01:34,661
Yeah, super cool how they
keep me from killing myself.

48
00:01:34,685 --> 00:01:36,763
And then Dean Fogg gives you
all matching tramp stamps?

49
00:01:36,786 --> 00:01:38,152
I thought tramp stamps

50
00:01:38,187 --> 00:01:39,854
were supposed to be on our lower back?

51
00:01:39,889 --> 00:01:42,202
God, I feel like I missed
out on some crazy party

52
00:01:42,249 --> 00:01:43,769
you'll be talking about
for the rest of your lives.

53
00:01:43,793 --> 00:01:46,260
Say what you want, but we
brought back weapons and a plan.

54
00:01:46,295 --> 00:01:48,195
What do you have to show for yourself?

55
00:01:51,934 --> 00:01:57,238
Ta... fucking... da.

56
00:01:58,374 --> 00:02:00,608
Your royal accoutrement.

57
00:02:00,643 --> 00:02:03,544
This is ceremony, people,

58
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:06,847
and I expect you to
slather yourselves in it.

59
00:02:06,883 --> 00:02:07,848
Thank you, Eliot.

60
00:02:07,884 --> 00:02:10,518
I missed you all.

61
00:02:10,553 --> 00:02:11,919
And I was bored.

62
00:02:12,399 --> 00:02:13,754
Come. Sit.

63
00:02:13,789 --> 00:02:15,756
Wait, is this really
the most important thing

64
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:17,327
we could be doing right now?

65
00:02:17,468 --> 00:02:19,960
I mean, The Beast is still out there
waiting for us...

66
00:02:19,999 --> 00:02:21,665
The Beast can wait for five minutes.

67
00:02:21,704 --> 00:02:24,431
You are all Kings and Queens of Fillory.

68
00:02:24,618 --> 00:02:26,233
Well, almost all of you.

69
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,804
Just revel in your majesty
for one fucking second.

70
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,290
Be regal, miscreants.

71
00:02:37,274 --> 00:02:38,345
Mm.

72
00:02:39,852 --> 00:02:42,049
You're such a stupid, stupid, man.

73
00:02:42,084 --> 00:02:43,617
I'm gonna kill you in your sleep.

74
00:02:46,088 --> 00:02:48,656
El... El... El, you okay?

75
00:02:48,691 --> 00:02:50,758
Totally fine, why?

76
00:02:50,793 --> 00:02:51,892
It's just...

77
00:02:51,928 --> 00:02:53,171
you went away there for a minute.

78
00:02:53,195 --> 00:02:55,396
Nonsense. I feel great.

79
00:02:56,046 --> 00:02:57,176
Have a seat.

80
00:02:57,304 --> 00:02:59,300
I'm kind of on a clock here,

81
00:02:59,335 --> 00:03:01,235
so we should talk strategy.

82
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,314
Yeah, we already talked strategy,

83
00:03:02,338 --> 00:03:03,671
so we just need to catch you up.

84
00:03:03,706 --> 00:03:04,783
You've been planning without me?

85
00:03:04,807 --> 00:03:06,340
Yeah... when we were on Earth.

86
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:08,374
What did you think we were doing?

87
00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:14,826
Eliot, we're not trying to exclude you.

88
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,517
You just weren't there.

89
00:03:16,694 --> 00:03:19,014
No. No, I wasn't, was I?

90
00:03:20,156 --> 00:03:22,189
Don't think I don't see how this works.

91
00:03:22,224 --> 00:03:24,217
You disappear. You come back.

92
00:03:24,794 --> 00:03:27,428
Matching tattoos, and now
you're three against one.

93
00:03:27,463 --> 00:03:29,463
I know exactly what you're planning.

94
00:03:29,498 --> 00:03:31,520
- Don't touch me.
- Sweetie?

95
00:03:32,223 --> 00:03:34,268
You kind of sound insane.

96
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:35,835
Do I?

97
00:03:38,614 --> 00:03:41,942
Because I promise you...
I will not go down easily.

98
00:03:42,032 --> 00:03:43,629
Oo-surpers.

99
00:03:45,841 --> 00:03:48,182
Usurpers.

100
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:50,818
Whichever way you're
supposed to pronounce it.

101
00:03:50,853 --> 00:03:52,052
What just happened?

102
00:03:52,388 --> 00:03:54,544
He got like this on shrooms once.

103
00:03:55,029 --> 00:03:57,038
I'll go talk to him.

104
00:04:03,693 --> 00:04:05,633
I just remembered
something that Julia said,

105
00:04:05,668 --> 00:04:07,206
and it's starting to
make a lot of sense.

106
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:08,902
- You talked to that bitch?
- Yes, he did.

107
00:04:08,938 --> 00:04:11,138
It was a warning.
Something The Beast said.

108
00:04:11,173 --> 00:04:14,174
Uh... God, of course. It makes sense.

109
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,085
I mean, he'd want to
booby-trap his kingdom, right?

110
00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:20,014
So apparently, he left curses behind.

111
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:22,356
Here, actually.

112
00:04:22,468 --> 00:04:24,418
So you think Eliot might be cursed?

113
00:04:24,491 --> 00:04:26,258
I mean, she was vague, but I mean...

114
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,647
Did either of you notice

115
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:31,399
that Eliot started acting strangely

116
00:04:31,427 --> 00:04:33,718
once he took a drink from the goblet?

117
00:04:34,804 --> 00:04:39,155
I mean, it could be poison or a potion.

118
00:04:41,453 --> 00:04:44,538
All right, well, we probably shouldn't
drink from ours just to be safe.

119
00:04:44,573 --> 00:04:45,784
Or maybe it was just some primo

120
00:04:45,808 --> 00:04:47,252
Fillorian shit that went up his nose,

121
00:04:47,276 --> 00:04:48,905
and he's on the bad end of a trip

122
00:04:48,945 --> 00:04:50,678
because he's him.

123
00:04:53,054 --> 00:04:54,281
Did something happen to you?

124
00:04:54,316 --> 00:04:56,116
Nope. Nothing.

125
00:04:56,601 --> 00:04:58,671
I'm fine... Penny.

126
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,094
Wait. And now you're doing it.

127
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:08,519
I don't know what you're talking about.

128
00:05:08,543 --> 00:05:09,797
I mean like Eliot.

129
00:05:09,832 --> 00:05:11,411
You're acting all tweaky and shit.

130
00:05:11,443 --> 00:05:12,849
We're fine.

131
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:14,994
Clearly.

132
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:17,880
Look, I think we can all agree
that we have a problem here.

133
00:05:18,372 --> 00:05:19,466
Eliot.

134
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:23,410
He's High King. He's cursed.

135
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,647
- We have no choice but...
- We have to kill him.

136
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:28,608
Exactly.

137
00:05:28,883 --> 00:05:30,327
The thrones.

138
00:05:31,374 --> 00:05:32,728
They're both cursed.

139
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,723
This is hard for you. I get that.

140
00:05:35,968 --> 00:05:37,224
It's hard for us too.

141
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:38,640
But it must be done.

142
00:05:40,523 --> 00:05:42,117
For Fillory.

143
00:05:49,537 --> 00:05:51,171
But don't tell Quentin...

144
00:05:51,311 --> 00:05:53,240
I'm going to have to kill him too.

145
00:05:53,475 --> 00:05:55,085
Right after Margo.

146
00:06:05,194 --> 00:06:06,467
Margo?

147
00:06:07,522 --> 00:06:08,600
Margo.

148
00:06:08,756 --> 00:06:11,592
Margo. Margo. Margo.
We got a serious problem, okay?

149
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,293
I know. Eliot's cursed.

150
00:06:13,329 --> 00:06:15,329
No, no. Not just Eliot.
Alice and Quentin too.

151
00:06:15,364 --> 00:06:18,198
Listen, whatever you do, do
not sit on your throne, okay?

152
00:06:18,234 --> 00:06:21,201
Fine. Whatevs. I have a plan.

153
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,936
You gonna help me pick these?

154
00:06:22,972 --> 00:06:24,138
What's this? An antidote?

155
00:06:24,173 --> 00:06:25,606
Exactly. For the poison.

156
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:26,951
For the... what?

157
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:29,740
For the poison.

158
00:06:29,787 --> 00:06:32,834
I have to drink it first, or
I won't get Eliot to take it.

159
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:38,018
Jesus. You're acting like
this is your first regicide.

160
00:06:38,053 --> 00:06:40,454
Also, it's not the
thrones that are cursed.

161
00:06:40,489 --> 00:06:42,787
I sat on mine, and I'm totally fine.

162
00:06:43,192 --> 00:06:44,640
You sat on your...

163
00:06:45,027 --> 00:06:46,226
Fuck.

164
00:06:46,262 --> 00:06:47,654
Great. No, it's good.

165
00:06:47,763 --> 00:06:49,363
- Okay.
- Stop.

166
00:06:49,623 --> 00:06:50,723
This'll be over soon.

167
00:06:50,748 --> 00:06:53,767
I'll deal with Eliot and Alice and Q.

168
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,890
You're welcome.

169
00:06:59,803 --> 00:07:00,866
Shit.

170
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:10,943
<font color=#FF00FF>*THE MAGICIANS*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 02 Episode 03</font>
<font color=#FFFF00>"Divine Elimination"</font>

171
00:07:19,763 --> 00:07:22,996
So, this is our little fox trap, huh?

172
00:07:23,146 --> 00:07:24,271
Yeah.

173
00:07:24,928 --> 00:07:27,482
So, you want to tell me
where you hooked up with your partner?

174
00:07:27,584 --> 00:07:28,869
The Dirty Dozen?

175
00:07:30,404 --> 00:07:32,943
Ah. Fillory.

176
00:07:35,232 --> 00:07:36,877
Fine. Don't tell me.

177
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,699
Listen, I'm here. I want to help.

178
00:07:41,724 --> 00:07:44,068
But that asshole seems
like severe psychic damage.

179
00:07:44,093 --> 00:07:45,654
Look, I get it, okay?

180
00:07:46,045 --> 00:07:47,721
But he knows a spell to freeze a God.

181
00:07:47,756 --> 00:07:50,006
I mean, you can't find that
at your local safe house.

182
00:07:50,185 --> 00:07:53,227
Look, I have survived
this long on my instincts,

183
00:07:53,262 --> 00:07:55,128
and every one of them is telling me

184
00:07:55,164 --> 00:07:56,528
that he is bad news.

185
00:07:56,553 --> 00:07:57,464
He's gonna turn on me.

186
00:07:57,499 --> 00:07:59,733
Or you. Or both of us.

187
00:07:59,768 --> 00:08:02,135
He can't, okay? We have an agreement.

188
00:08:02,251 --> 00:08:03,335
Word as bond.

189
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,860
Those are tough to break.

190
00:08:05,462 --> 00:08:08,165
But if anyone could, it's someone
who could freeze a God.

191
00:08:08,727 --> 00:08:12,524
Are you girls discussing
the nature of our agreement?

192
00:08:12,977 --> 00:08:14,038
Marina was just asking.

193
00:08:14,063 --> 00:08:15,251
Straightforward.

194
00:08:15,298 --> 00:08:17,451
I betray her, she cuts me to the quick.

195
00:08:17,486 --> 00:08:19,453
So, tell me, what
happens after the tenets

196
00:08:19,488 --> 00:08:21,121
of the agreement are met?

197
00:08:21,273 --> 00:08:23,484
Why worry? You'll be long gone by then.

198
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:26,297
So, tell me. Are we ready?

199
00:08:27,703 --> 00:08:28,703
Yeah.

200
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,566
? A-hunting we will go,
a-hunting we will go?

201
00:08:32,781 --> 00:08:34,346
? We'll catch a fox and
put him in a box?

202
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,398
? And then we'll let him go?

203
00:08:37,898 --> 00:08:40,359
What? Those are the lyrics.

204
00:08:47,335 --> 00:08:48,663
Benedict, right?

205
00:08:49,038 --> 00:08:50,117
I need your help.

206
00:08:51,954 --> 00:08:53,467
What do you do here again?

207
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:55,575
Royal mapmaker, sire.

208
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,396
Is your problem
cartographical in nature?

209
00:08:58,421 --> 00:08:59,459
Not really.

210
00:08:59,495 --> 00:09:02,596
What I need, Benedict, is a dagger.

211
00:09:02,728 --> 00:09:04,158
A stiletto, really.

212
00:09:04,366 --> 00:09:07,658
Something I can sneak
up and stab someone with.

213
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,336
But regal.

214
00:09:11,314 --> 00:09:12,908
I make maps, Your Majesty.

215
00:09:13,306 --> 00:09:16,463
Well,... surely, someone has
snuck into your office

216
00:09:16,488 --> 00:09:19,298
and dramatically stabbed a knife
into a map to make a point, no?

217
00:09:20,775 --> 00:09:21,960
The other Kings and Queens who died...

218
00:09:21,984 --> 00:09:24,751
we'd always just thought
it was just infighting.

219
00:09:24,787 --> 00:09:26,453
Greed and power.

220
00:09:26,488 --> 00:09:28,355
Guess what? It's just
another horrible thing

221
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:32,526
The Beast was responsible
for, so how do we reverse this?

222
00:09:32,966 --> 00:09:34,559
Curses are tricky.

223
00:09:34,697 --> 00:09:36,231
You don't say.

224
00:09:37,606 --> 00:09:39,864
They usually end once
they've run their course.

225
00:09:40,177 --> 00:09:41,261
And not before.

226
00:09:41,286 --> 00:09:42,473
That doesn't help us.

227
00:09:42,942 --> 00:09:45,462
This one seems to want to run its
course until they're all dead.

228
00:09:46,497 --> 00:09:48,856
Shit. Dead.

229
00:09:49,841 --> 00:09:50,950
- I have an idea.
- Okay.

230
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:53,669
Do not let them kill each other, okay?

231
00:09:53,716 --> 00:09:54,716
Mm-hmm.

232
00:09:57,427 --> 00:09:58,989
I call on you.

233
00:09:59,247 --> 00:10:01,427
Our Lady Underground.

234
00:10:02,606 --> 00:10:05,231
As a child of the Earth...

235
00:10:06,247 --> 00:10:09,458
I seek you, O Mother.

236
00:10:10,153 --> 00:10:11,763
- Hey.
- Mm?

237
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:15,559
Do me a favor and just believe it.

238
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,171
A benevolent Mommy who
will solve my problems

239
00:10:18,207 --> 00:10:20,141
with her Gaia power?

240
00:10:21,227 --> 00:10:23,719
Yeah. Or Reynard won't show.

241
00:10:24,852 --> 00:10:27,188
You realize I don't even
own a pair of yoga pants.

242
00:10:29,118 --> 00:10:30,149
So act.

243
00:10:43,485 --> 00:10:47,297
I seek to know you, Divine Mother.

244
00:10:48,555 --> 00:10:51,211
Giver of life and light.

245
00:10:51,547 --> 00:10:53,707
I ask to gaze upon you.

246
00:10:53,805 --> 00:10:55,649
To hear your voice.

247
00:10:56,071 --> 00:10:58,278
To feel the beating heart of you.

248
00:10:58,508 --> 00:11:01,248
I beseech you. Hear me now.

249
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,508
What happened? Where are we?

250
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:08,649
A park. Few blocks away.

251
00:11:08,797 --> 00:11:11,558
Is this a joke? Take us back now.

252
00:11:11,593 --> 00:11:13,399
Well, we can't go back.

253
00:11:13,633 --> 00:11:15,595
Reynard's scented you before.

254
00:11:15,631 --> 00:11:17,664
If he smells you again, he won't show.

255
00:11:17,946 --> 00:11:19,800
If you want him,

256
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:22,313
you might just have to
risk losing your bait.

257
00:11:22,852 --> 00:11:24,971
I'm sorry. You're saying this now?

258
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:28,475
Well, if I'd told you before,
would you have agreed to it?

259
00:11:29,141 --> 00:11:30,618
Fine. I'll walk.

260
00:11:30,985 --> 00:11:32,352
Oh, excellent idea.

261
00:11:32,422 --> 00:11:33,647
By the time we arrive,

262
00:11:33,696 --> 00:11:35,849
he'll be so engrossed
in Marina's evisceration,

263
00:11:35,884 --> 00:11:38,085
he won't even realize we're there.

264
00:11:38,274 --> 00:11:39,579
You're good.

265
00:11:44,016 --> 00:11:47,260
I ask to gaze upon
you. To hear your voice.

266
00:11:47,296 --> 00:11:48,695
To feel the beating heart of you.

267
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:51,965
I ask to gaze upon
you! To hear your voice!

268
00:11:52,023 --> 00:11:54,403
To feel the beating heart of you!

269
00:11:59,606 --> 00:12:01,575
Oh, you've got to be fucking kidding.

270
00:12:03,082 --> 00:12:04,211
Fuck this noise.

271
00:12:17,411 --> 00:12:18,492
What's so funny?

272
00:12:18,926 --> 00:12:20,637
You with a crossbow.

273
00:12:21,223 --> 00:12:24,247
You couldn't hit a fat girl
with a fat-girl-seeking arrow.

274
00:12:25,247 --> 00:12:26,831
Oh, don't give me that look.

275
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,645
It's a figure of speech.

276
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:31,338
No way in hell I'll miss
you from this range.

277
00:12:31,434 --> 00:12:35,342
Well, if you use that arrow
as good as you use your dick...

278
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:40,567
You enchanted yourself, didn't you?

279
00:12:40,661 --> 00:12:41,715
I'm not an idiot.

280
00:12:43,661 --> 00:12:46,353
Margo says go free.

281
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,176
Oh, fuck.

282
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,253
Jesus Christ.

283
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:56,596
Penny says go free.

284
00:13:08,443 --> 00:13:09,509
Aah!

285
00:13:12,447 --> 00:13:14,414
You just had to let him save you, huh?

286
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,042
You're such a girl.

287
00:13:16,067 --> 00:13:17,717
You know, I would like to see you dead

288
00:13:17,753 --> 00:13:19,253
regardless of your gender.

289
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:20,895
Shut up. Both of you.

290
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:23,089
I'm gonna take you someplace safe,

291
00:13:23,114 --> 00:13:24,269
but if I have to shoot
you to get you there,

292
00:13:24,293 --> 00:13:25,731
I will make sure it hurts.

293
00:13:25,832 --> 00:13:27,817
Gee, thanks, but I'm enchanted.

294
00:13:28,457 --> 00:13:29,497
Aah!

295
00:13:29,911 --> 00:13:31,347
Your enchantment's weak.

296
00:13:31,372 --> 00:13:32,637
Aah!

297
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:35,270
You shot me, you cock.

298
00:13:35,552 --> 00:13:38,661
Why didn't you shoot her in the neck?
The carotid is right there.

299
00:13:47,653 --> 00:13:48,989
Don't fret.

300
00:13:49,543 --> 00:13:51,175
If Reynard had killed Marina,

301
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,676
don't you think there'd be lots of
little Marina bits lying around?

302
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:55,942
She ran.

303
00:13:56,598 --> 00:13:58,715
I don't think she even
finished the spell.

304
00:13:59,692 --> 00:14:02,095
We're gonna have to
start this all over again,

305
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,722
and now we've lost Marina.

306
00:14:03,747 --> 00:14:05,176
I don't even know how
we're supposed to do...

307
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,499
Don't be so hasty.

308
00:14:06,535 --> 00:14:08,848
Are you absolutely sure it didn't work?

309
00:14:09,512 --> 00:14:10,737
If I were your fox God,

310
00:14:10,772 --> 00:14:14,192
I might just, say, follow her home

311
00:14:14,481 --> 00:14:16,754
rather than kill her on the spot.

312
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:22,964
You knew this was going to happen.

313
00:14:22,989 --> 00:14:24,887
Why do you think I
took you out of there?

314
00:14:25,395 --> 00:14:28,655
Chin up. If I'm right, our
little summoning worked.

315
00:14:29,004 --> 00:14:30,467
We just need to find foxy

316
00:14:30,492 --> 00:14:33,856
before he's finished with
his prey, n'est-ce pas?

317
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:59,043
You just locked us
both inside, you know?

318
00:15:00,845 --> 00:15:02,559
You must be Marina.

319
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:13,918
Shit. Her wards are up.

320
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,559
We can't get inside.

321
00:15:16,411 --> 00:15:17,832
Can you break them?

322
00:15:19,926 --> 00:15:22,098
Aha. Here.

323
00:15:22,847 --> 00:15:24,317
That's one.

324
00:15:24,918 --> 00:15:28,848
Settle in. This may take a bit.

325
00:15:31,043 --> 00:15:34,504
Bad news... you're cursed.

326
00:15:34,676 --> 00:15:37,411
Good news... I think there's a way out.

327
00:15:37,497 --> 00:15:39,098
Does it involve your beheading?

328
00:15:39,123 --> 00:15:40,818
'Cause that's the ending
I'm voting for right now.

329
00:15:40,842 --> 00:15:43,481
I second that. My ass still hurts.

330
00:15:43,506 --> 00:15:44,731
Enough!

331
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,943
Listen.

332
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:47,612
I can't stop the curse,

333
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:50,325
so the plan is we're gonna
let it run its course.

334
00:15:50,481 --> 00:15:52,583
By killing you. All of you.

335
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,619
- No likey.
- What's to likey?

336
00:15:54,654 --> 00:15:56,721
The part where you're
dead sounds perfect.

337
00:15:56,756 --> 00:15:58,098
Shut up.

338
00:15:59,005 --> 00:16:01,504
Now, I took a little
trip to get supplies.

339
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:04,950
Oh, goody. Heroin.

340
00:16:05,739 --> 00:16:07,972
I always suspected this was how I'd go.

341
00:16:07,997 --> 00:16:11,012
Potassium chloride will
shut down the heart.

342
00:16:11,356 --> 00:16:13,653
Adrenaline will kick-start it.

343
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:17,575
You die. Curse ends. I revive you.

344
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:20,611
Except what if any part
of that plan doesn't work?

345
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:22,647
Look, asshole. You don't like my idea,

346
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:23,993
why don't you go find someone else

347
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:25,583
to save your annoying fucking life?

348
00:16:25,681 --> 00:16:28,293
I have about a thousand better
things to do with my day.

349
00:16:31,441 --> 00:16:33,121
What the hell?

350
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,516
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

351
00:16:38,556 --> 00:16:42,800
My-My  fingers are a little numb
due to the anti-curse things.

352
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,769
Well, that's just perfect.

353
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:46,415
It's fine.

354
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,009
Uh, it's fine.

355
00:16:48,034 --> 00:16:49,774
So, are we still hostages or what?

356
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:51,616
Yes. Yes, you are.

357
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:53,822
Would you point that thing
at their fucking heads?

358
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,246
Everyone please,

359
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:57,038
please just stand in your corners

360
00:16:57,063 --> 00:16:59,296
and just quietly...

361
00:17:00,032 --> 00:17:03,499
- Dang it, Margo.
- Yeah, yeah. Whatever.

362
00:17:03,766 --> 00:17:05,327
You're dead.

363
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:15,827
I suppose this is one way to
get the killing bit over with?

364
00:17:16,274 --> 00:17:17,360
Yeah.

365
00:17:17,415 --> 00:17:19,163
This is what I was planning.

366
00:17:19,477 --> 00:17:23,618
The wards around this place
were deceptively advanced.

367
00:17:23,962 --> 00:17:26,984
I'm impressed. You have talent.

368
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:29,847
I bet you say that to all the girls

369
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:33,023
right before you rape them,
kill them, and eat their hearts.

370
00:17:33,274 --> 00:17:35,976
You wear that cynicism so stylishly.

371
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,398
It's too bad I know it's a lie.

372
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:39,579
Is it?

373
00:17:40,563 --> 00:17:43,569
No true cynic would call to the Goddess.

374
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,765
That must hurt, to know
she wasn't listening.

375
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:49,329
On the plus side, I was.

376
00:17:49,782 --> 00:17:51,235
Listen, I love the foreplay.

377
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,037
It's hot. It really is.

378
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,038
But just get it over with and kill me...

379
00:17:57,063 --> 00:17:58,890
All in good time.

380
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:02,113
You know, it doesn't take Freud

381
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:04,381
to see that a God who
likes to prey on chicks

382
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:07,899
is compensating for
a lack of... something.

383
00:18:09,263 --> 00:18:11,062
What even are you?

384
00:18:11,342 --> 00:18:13,296
God of Goat Herding?

385
00:18:13,568 --> 00:18:14,959
Grapes?

386
00:18:15,006 --> 00:18:16,640
Oh, wait. Is it Manure?

387
00:18:17,974 --> 00:18:20,498
I bet you love coming here
and fucking with mortals

388
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:23,021
'cause back home in
God-land, you barely rank.

389
00:18:23,638 --> 00:18:26,036
Watch your mouth, or I'll
slice out your tongue,

390
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:27,976
and I'll eat it in front of you.

391
00:18:28,886 --> 00:18:31,441
You're really not getting the
message that you don't scare me.

392
00:18:31,466 --> 00:18:33,988
Oh, I think I do scare you.

393
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:46,366
So rare for someone to try to
summon Our Lady on their own.

394
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:48,714
You're all alone, aren't you?

395
00:18:48,895 --> 00:18:51,624
There's... no else in your life.

396
00:18:51,831 --> 00:18:53,101
Seriously?

397
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,432
Trying to hurt my feelings?

398
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,712
And the best you can come up with

399
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:58,936
is "why couldn't you find a man?"

400
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:01,696
Is anyone really gonna miss you?

401
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:03,826
I tip the pizza guy pretty well.

402
00:19:03,873 --> 00:19:05,231
Hmm

403
00:19:06,118 --> 00:19:07,763
Ah...

404
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:11,760
You're not totally alone.

405
00:19:12,391 --> 00:19:15,719
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

406
00:19:16,589 --> 00:19:18,127
Aww

407
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,047
Cupcake?

408
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,588
What a cutie she is.

409
00:19:23,063 --> 00:19:26,963
You witches and your familiars.

410
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:30,627
Hmm. You don't care for people,

411
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,541
but you do love her, don't you?

412
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:35,868
Don't be stupid.

413
00:19:35,915 --> 00:19:38,306
She's just a dumb cat. Put her down.

414
00:19:38,353 --> 00:19:42,190
No. I'd like to pet her.

415
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,239
Oh. Look at that.

416
00:20:00,286 --> 00:20:02,296
I think she might still be alive.

417
00:20:02,343 --> 00:20:04,225
That's funny.

418
00:20:05,465 --> 00:20:06,865
Uh-uh.

419
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:10,041
No magic.

420
00:20:11,512 --> 00:20:13,030
Aah!

421
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,326
See?

422
00:20:20,481 --> 00:20:22,717
So much more fun to be had.

423
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:24,725
What's the rush?

424
00:20:39,145 --> 00:20:44,708
Ha! I won, bitches. I'm
High motherfucking Queen.

425
00:20:44,755 --> 00:20:46,707
Get the other needles. Hurry.

426
00:20:46,754 --> 00:20:48,334
Hey! Stay back.

427
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:49,610
Margo, we don't have time for this.

428
00:20:49,657 --> 00:20:50,745
We got to revive 'em now.

429
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,513
What's best in life, Penny?

430
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,363
What?

431
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,247
What's best in life?

432
00:20:55,294 --> 00:20:56,809
I don't know.

433
00:20:56,856 --> 00:21:00,021
To crush your enemies,
see them driven before you,

434
00:21:00,068 --> 00:21:03,126
and hear the lamentations
of their women.

435
00:21:03,995 --> 00:21:06,488
Come at me, farm girl.

436
00:21:11,612 --> 00:21:14,463
That's one thorough fucking curse.

437
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:17,429
Is it wrong to say I find her
death extremely satisfying?

438
00:21:17,476 --> 00:21:19,343
Okay, come on. I need your help.

439
00:21:25,874 --> 00:21:27,644
Oh, my God.

440
00:21:28,565 --> 00:21:29,728
What the hell?

441
00:21:29,775 --> 00:21:32,785
Welcome back. Loser.

442
00:21:34,438 --> 00:21:36,707
Do you want me to get that?

443
00:21:36,874 --> 00:21:38,496
Aah...

444
00:21:43,862 --> 00:21:45,387
It's time.

445
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:49,590
Don't know how long I'll
have to cast the Rhinemann.

446
00:21:50,206 --> 00:21:52,751
Ugh. Eliot's right. It's a stupid name.

447
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:54,670
And I wish I had a beer.

448
00:21:54,752 --> 00:21:56,131
That really doesn't look right.

449
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:58,623
Does it require me playing Rachmaninoff?

450
00:21:58,729 --> 00:22:01,927
If not... we're fine.

451
00:22:02,006 --> 00:22:03,462
Look, you still got to grab The Beast.

452
00:22:03,513 --> 00:22:05,155
What happens if you
take the bracelets off?

453
00:22:05,202 --> 00:22:06,965
- That's a bad idea.
- Well, then, how are you...

454
00:22:07,012 --> 00:22:08,400
All I have to do is touch him, right?

455
00:22:08,447 --> 00:22:09,635
So I'll tackle his ass, okay?

456
00:22:09,682 --> 00:22:13,530
Well, we are down two cacodemons.

457
00:22:13,577 --> 00:22:15,783
Any ideas how to slow up The Beast now?

458
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,943
Actually, we only have one.

459
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,078
I let mine go.

460
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:21,272
Oh, Jesus. Come on.

461
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:23,340
I could feel it. Alive and in my skin.

462
00:22:23,387 --> 00:22:25,484
I couldn't stand the idea
of it being trapped in there.

463
00:22:25,531 --> 00:22:27,486
- Shocking no one.
- Just leave her alone.

464
00:22:27,533 --> 00:22:29,513
It's not like you
have yours. I do, so...

465
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,956
Because you were too much of a pussy

466
00:22:31,003 --> 00:22:31,924
to use it.

467
00:22:31,971 --> 00:22:33,516
I got this, Q.

468
00:22:34,351 --> 00:22:36,429
Okay. Idea.

469
00:22:36,476 --> 00:22:38,630
Do you guys remember
the Sumerian shield charm

470
00:22:38,677 --> 00:22:40,134
we learned in PA?

471
00:22:40,202 --> 00:22:41,033
Like, to keep you safe

472
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,736
from shattered glass or something?

473
00:22:42,783 --> 00:22:44,227
It's a simple spell,

474
00:22:44,274 --> 00:22:45,671
but that doesn't mean it's not powerful.

475
00:22:45,718 --> 00:22:47,439
Especially if all three
of us are casting it.

476
00:22:47,486 --> 00:22:50,421
Use a first-year spell
to stop The Beast?

477
00:22:50,468 --> 00:22:51,802
That sounds like suicide.

478
00:22:51,849 --> 00:22:53,479
Which I've already tried today,

479
00:22:53,526 --> 00:22:54,746
and no, thank you.

480
00:22:54,793 --> 00:22:57,741
- Next.
- No. No. There is no next.

481
00:22:57,788 --> 00:23:01,186
We are running out of time
and options and God jizz.

482
00:23:01,233 --> 00:23:03,280
Look, just imagine dicks, okay?

483
00:23:03,327 --> 00:23:05,023
With one dick, you're
just jerking yourself off,

484
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,859
but with three dicks,
suddenly you've got

485
00:23:06,906 --> 00:23:08,427
six people having sex.

486
00:23:08,474 --> 00:23:10,742
Which is more powerful?

487
00:23:11,155 --> 00:23:14,666
I think your metaphor literally
doesn't make any fucking sense.

488
00:23:14,713 --> 00:23:15,759
It doesn't have to.

489
00:23:15,806 --> 00:23:17,169
It just distracted you long enough

490
00:23:17,216 --> 00:23:18,604
for Alice to power up the spell,

491
00:23:18,651 --> 00:23:22,248
which is all the shield charm has to do.

492
00:23:23,313 --> 00:23:24,913
I see what you did there.

493
00:23:27,451 --> 00:23:29,560
Struck a nerve, didn't I?

494
00:23:32,426 --> 00:23:33,952
Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.

495
00:23:33,999 --> 00:23:36,303
I fell asleep for a moment.

496
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:39,568
You ever eat something still alive?

497
00:23:40,832 --> 00:23:42,654
Can't say that I have.

498
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,904
Civilized species and all.

499
00:23:45,746 --> 00:23:47,763
You're missing out.

500
00:23:47,905 --> 00:23:52,537
I recommend starting at the far end,

501
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:55,412
so you can enjoy the fear.

502
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:58,068
It's chemical.

503
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:01,967
You can taste it. The fear.

504
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,834
Not to mention the look on
your face. It's priceless.

505
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:08,290
So why don't you and I...

506
00:24:13,096 --> 00:24:14,726
Apologies for the tardiness.

507
00:24:14,773 --> 00:24:17,465
You wards are rather extensive.

508
00:24:36,887 --> 00:24:38,383
Are we ready?

509
00:24:45,729 --> 00:24:47,172
Hey.

510
00:24:52,183 --> 00:24:53,617
Yeah.

511
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,523
He's fighting the net.

512
00:25:28,959 --> 00:25:30,768
Not sure how much
longer I can hold this.

513
00:25:30,815 --> 00:25:32,062
Jesus Christ, Julia,

514
00:25:32,109 --> 00:25:34,040
would you please just gut this guy?

515
00:25:34,087 --> 00:25:35,758
With pleasure.

516
00:25:40,567 --> 00:25:42,433
No! No...

517
00:26:02,539 --> 00:26:03,939
Now!

518
00:26:06,436 --> 00:26:07,673
- Julia.
- Blow that bitch up!

519
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,510
Let's go.

520
00:26:12,449 --> 00:26:14,158
Move!

521
00:26:38,881 --> 00:26:40,281
No!

522
00:26:40,711 --> 00:26:42,944
I missed him! I missed him!

523
00:26:44,084 --> 00:26:46,405
I missed him! I missed him!

524
00:26:46,452 --> 00:26:47,546
I had Reynard.

525
00:26:47,593 --> 00:26:48,505
He was right in front of me.

526
00:26:48,552 --> 00:26:50,930
Yeah, and then you
screwed up our plan again.

527
00:26:50,977 --> 00:26:52,123
She just grabbed me.

528
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:53,633
No, you all don't understand.

529
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,758
I had Reynard. I had The Beast.

530
00:26:55,805 --> 00:26:58,091
Fuck this. We're out.

531
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,288
Get off me!

532
00:27:04,335 --> 00:27:06,188
Where are we? Where did you take me?

533
00:27:06,235 --> 00:27:07,450
Subway's that way.

534
00:27:07,497 --> 00:27:08,868
Good luck with your bullshit.

535
00:27:08,915 --> 00:27:10,601
Hey. Take me back.

536
00:27:10,648 --> 00:27:12,172
I need him.

537
00:27:12,219 --> 00:27:13,606
I need The Beast to kill Reynard.

538
00:27:13,653 --> 00:27:14,665
Reynard has the knife.

539
00:27:14,712 --> 00:27:16,042
I can't do it without The Beast.

540
00:27:16,089 --> 00:27:17,533
It's not my problem.

541
00:27:18,582 --> 00:27:19,578
Oh, shit.

542
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:21,116
Duck!

543
00:27:23,673 --> 00:27:25,794
- Shit...
- What the hell?

544
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,393
The chain was the only thing
keeping my hand from fucking...

545
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,786
- Put it back on.
- I can't!

546
00:27:29,833 --> 00:27:31,899
It's a ritual, and I don't have any...

547
00:27:32,257 --> 00:27:33,253
Oh, no.

548
00:27:33,309 --> 00:27:34,667
Get...

549
00:27:35,849 --> 00:27:37,027
Thank you.

550
00:27:37,098 --> 00:27:38,789
Yeah. No problem.

551
00:27:41,874 --> 00:27:44,109
- You fucking...
- Sorry.

552
00:27:44,156 --> 00:27:46,322
- Not my problem.
- Fuck.

553
00:27:54,352 --> 00:27:55,973
He's injured. Where else would he be?

554
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,283
He has to be at the Wellspring.

555
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:59,085
The Royal Carriage can
get there in under an hour.

556
00:27:59,132 --> 00:28:00,520
Okay, but if he can just blip in...

557
00:28:00,567 --> 00:28:02,180
Well, hopefully, his accuracy isn't

558
00:28:02,227 --> 00:28:04,315
at its best right now.
I know mine wouldn't be.

559
00:28:04,362 --> 00:28:06,526
Well, if those horses get
us there before The Beast,

560
00:28:06,573 --> 00:28:07,861
I'll gladly fuck them both.

561
00:28:07,908 --> 00:28:10,304
Hey. Shh. Careful. Volume.

562
00:28:10,351 --> 00:28:12,657
I think those are talking horses.

563
00:28:12,704 --> 00:28:14,403
Offer stands.

564
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,062
Hey, can you still do this?

565
00:28:18,334 --> 00:28:19,771
I don't know.

566
00:28:19,818 --> 00:28:21,937
What choice do we have?

567
00:28:22,365 --> 00:28:24,061
Okay, we should send
El and Margo for help.

568
00:28:24,108 --> 00:28:26,407
Wait, you don't want us on
the suicide mission with you?

569
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:27,698
Ember's temple is nearby,

570
00:28:27,745 --> 00:28:31,363
so just go and petition him for a re-up.

571
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,507
Just in case Alice and I...

572
00:28:32,554 --> 00:28:34,388
Fail? Die?

573
00:28:35,449 --> 00:28:36,574
Sorry. Reflex.

574
00:28:36,621 --> 00:28:38,567
Okay. Fine. We'll go.

575
00:28:52,691 --> 00:28:54,888
Hey. Thought exercise.

576
00:28:56,957 --> 00:29:02,044
Say we kill The Beast. Ahh... what then?

577
00:29:03,403 --> 00:29:05,136
Quentin, I don't know.

578
00:29:05,183 --> 00:29:07,740
It's just... it's a distraction.

579
00:29:07,843 --> 00:29:09,482
Come on.

580
00:29:12,785 --> 00:29:14,826
Um...

581
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:18,130
I would...

582
00:29:20,465 --> 00:29:22,888
I'd eat an ice cream sundae.

583
00:29:24,073 --> 00:29:26,029
With whipped cream and...

584
00:29:26,707 --> 00:29:28,626
those fake rainbow-colored sprinkles

585
00:29:28,673 --> 00:29:31,810
and... gummy bears on top.

586
00:29:33,129 --> 00:29:35,099
I'm probably gonna try and win you back.

587
00:29:35,146 --> 00:29:36,668
Jesus, Quentin.

588
00:29:36,715 --> 00:29:38,428
I'm sorry. That just sort
of flew out of my mouth.

589
00:29:38,475 --> 00:29:40,675
You know, I'm not a prize.

590
00:29:40,722 --> 00:29:42,340
I know that, but you know what I mean.

591
00:29:42,387 --> 00:29:45,061
No, and you didn't
just lose me like keys.

592
00:29:45,108 --> 00:29:47,849
I know, which is why I feel like I need

593
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:50,114
to earn back your trust.

594
00:29:50,161 --> 00:29:52,068
This isn't fair.

595
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,068
You can't trap me in here.

596
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:56,854
You can't trap me in here and expect me

597
00:29:56,901 --> 00:29:58,530
to deal with all this
heavy emotional shit

598
00:29:58,577 --> 00:29:59,957
when all I can handle right now...

599
00:30:00,004 --> 00:30:02,694
all I can handle right now is a
Goddamn ice cream sundae, okay?

600
00:30:02,741 --> 00:30:03,652
It's not a trap.

601
00:30:03,699 --> 00:30:05,120
Yes, it is, and why does it sound

602
00:30:05,167 --> 00:30:06,420
like you're trying to fight with me?

603
00:30:06,467 --> 00:30:08,901
Look. You've changed. Okay.

604
00:30:09,142 --> 00:30:12,670
You are not the girl that
I met a million years ago.

605
00:30:12,717 --> 00:30:14,878
You are amazing.

606
00:30:15,454 --> 00:30:18,378
And not that you weren't
amazing before, but...

607
00:30:19,072 --> 00:30:21,168
Quentin, where are you going with this?

608
00:30:21,215 --> 00:30:22,854
You've grown.

609
00:30:23,369 --> 00:30:27,142
And you're still growing,
and my point is that I am too.

610
00:30:27,189 --> 00:30:29,004
Are you saying you're
"not that guy anymore"?

611
00:30:29,051 --> 00:30:31,622
No, I'm saying that I'm not
just that guy anymore,

612
00:30:31,669 --> 00:30:34,559
and I think that you...
I hope that you give me

613
00:30:34,606 --> 00:30:39,228
the opportunity to be better
and actually deserve you.

614
00:30:39,275 --> 00:30:41,766
And I know that that
sounds stupid, but I just...

615
00:30:41,813 --> 00:30:44,402
I feel like we could
die in, like, an hour,

616
00:30:44,449 --> 00:30:47,956
and it's giving me a
lot of clarity right now.

617
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:51,275
I don't know what to say, Quentin.

618
00:30:51,322 --> 00:30:52,743
Also, I'm gonna make you

619
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:55,471
the best ice cream
sundae you've ever had.

620
00:30:55,518 --> 00:30:57,248
You're gonna forget Popper 1,

621
00:30:57,295 --> 00:31:00,556
and I'm even gonna
put gummy bears on it,

622
00:31:00,603 --> 00:31:01,752
even though you don't understand

623
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:04,284
how absolutely disgusting that is.

624
00:31:07,196 --> 00:31:08,675
Quentin.

625
00:31:15,939 --> 00:31:18,135
I'm sorry. I just was in the moment.

626
00:31:18,182 --> 00:31:20,394
Do you still want to fight?

627
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,620
No.

628
00:31:28,651 --> 00:31:30,519
Ember!

629
00:31:30,978 --> 00:31:32,729
Come out!

630
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,126
Hello?

631
00:31:34,173 --> 00:31:35,511
I'm pretty sure Q said

632
00:31:35,558 --> 00:31:37,567
the whole blood-stone
thing works right away.

633
00:31:37,614 --> 00:31:39,292
Fine. Give me your hand.

634
00:31:40,997 --> 00:31:42,496
Just...

635
00:31:43,806 --> 00:31:45,886
Oh, come on.

636
00:31:47,431 --> 00:31:49,160
Ow. That kind of stings.

637
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:50,683
Poor baby.

638
00:31:52,142 --> 00:31:53,565
Great.

639
00:31:54,962 --> 00:31:57,520
Well, now we're both bleeding.

640
00:31:57,567 --> 00:31:59,542
Maybe Ember isn't home.

641
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,370
He's a God-in-exile.

642
00:32:01,417 --> 00:32:04,151
- Where else could he be?
- I don't know.

643
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:10,167
Oh, God.

644
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:17,798
Ah!

645
00:32:17,845 --> 00:32:23,331
Greetings, oh, powerful
and glorious Martin Chatwin.

646
00:32:23,931 --> 00:32:26,861
My goodness. Only half
the man I remember.

647
00:32:26,908 --> 00:32:28,939
You know what happens
if you stay in Fillory.

648
00:32:28,986 --> 00:32:30,708
I know, I know. I'm leaving.

649
00:32:30,755 --> 00:32:34,542
I'm going. I just had
one or two things to do.

650
00:32:34,626 --> 00:32:36,394
Mainly number two.

651
00:32:37,353 --> 00:32:41,808
I have befouled the Wellspring.

652
00:32:42,072 --> 00:32:43,136
Pardon me?

653
00:32:43,183 --> 00:32:45,307
I have left my divine elimination

654
00:32:45,354 --> 00:32:46,690
in the font of all magic.

655
00:32:46,737 --> 00:32:47,722
And it's a stinker.

656
00:32:47,769 --> 00:32:49,771
I really hope you weren't
planning to drink from it.

657
00:32:49,818 --> 00:32:53,464
- It's hardly potable.
- You... what?

658
00:32:53,634 --> 00:32:59,300
Left my leavings... a
Godly floater... behind.

659
00:33:00,147 --> 00:33:02,314
In the Wellspring.

660
00:33:04,439 --> 00:33:05,660
I pooped in it.

661
00:33:05,707 --> 00:33:07,690
Am I not making this very clear?

662
00:33:07,737 --> 00:33:09,651
You wretched bastard.

663
00:33:09,736 --> 00:33:11,293
I know your true game.

664
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:15,904
I know exactly every twist,
you... you stinking man-sheep!

665
00:33:15,951 --> 00:33:17,581
Oh, my heavens. Look at the time.

666
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:19,349
I really should be going,

667
00:33:19,396 --> 00:33:23,256
although technically, I already went.

668
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:26,800
I never tire of these jokes. Ta!

669
00:33:29,134 --> 00:33:31,640
Oh! Oh!

670
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:34,203
Oh! Oh!

671
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:43,150
You stinking man-sheep!

672
00:33:43,197 --> 00:33:45,088
You're no God!

673
00:33:45,324 --> 00:33:49,456
You're no God! You're a farm animal!
You're not God!

674
00:33:49,534 --> 00:33:51,401
Ember actually took a
shit in the Wellspring?

675
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,995
You're a farm animal!

676
00:33:53,042 --> 00:33:55,314
Well, that can't be good for Fillory.

677
00:34:00,977 --> 00:34:03,519
Quentin Coldwater!

678
00:34:03,566 --> 00:34:04,634
Shit.

679
00:34:04,681 --> 00:34:07,783
Why don't you and Alice come join me?

680
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:13,476
Mm.

681
00:34:13,523 --> 00:34:15,111
You're weaker.

682
00:34:15,149 --> 00:34:17,760
And you're down six fingers.

683
00:34:18,161 --> 00:34:20,425
More than enough to kill you both.

684
00:34:21,498 --> 00:34:25,034
Hard to cast when you're sliced in two.

685
00:34:30,473 --> 00:34:32,103
Quentin!

686
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:34,862
You're a tough piece
of meat, aren't you?

687
00:34:35,525 --> 00:34:37,518
No matter.

688
00:34:45,522 --> 00:34:47,043
Aah!

689
00:34:47,432 --> 00:34:48,988
Ahh!

690
00:34:56,783 --> 00:34:58,808
I guess we're gonna die.

691
00:34:59,135 --> 00:35:01,199
To our pretty corpses.

692
00:35:01,246 --> 00:35:04,669
Children of Earth! I have returned.

693
00:35:04,716 --> 00:35:08,843
Spank my cheeks. You're both royalty.

694
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:10,700
How delightful.

695
00:35:10,747 --> 00:35:13,551
You have come here to beseech me?

696
00:35:13,932 --> 00:35:16,355
Well, yes.

697
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:20,628
We have come to beseech your uhm... aid.

698
00:35:20,706 --> 00:35:23,572
Of course! You shall have it.

699
00:35:23,706 --> 00:35:26,316
Oh. Oh, but then
you're going to miss it.

700
00:35:26,363 --> 00:35:28,159
- Miss what?
- All the action.

701
00:35:28,206 --> 00:35:29,686
Between you and me,

702
00:35:29,733 --> 00:35:32,082
I think Alice should make
this a very good show.

703
00:35:32,129 --> 00:35:33,518
No promises, though.

704
00:35:33,565 --> 00:35:34,866
Cheerio! Happy ruling!

705
00:35:34,913 --> 00:35:36,894
- No...
- Ember, we...

706
00:35:37,486 --> 00:35:40,177
Great. Kicked us out before
we could even ask for the jizz.

707
00:35:40,224 --> 00:35:41,582
Margo, look.

708
00:35:42,335 --> 00:35:44,111
Is that all you got?

709
00:35:49,419 --> 00:35:51,913
You're not even a real
magician, are you, Martin?

710
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,933
You're just a scared little boy.

711
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:57,910
You wouldn't last an hour at Brakebills.

712
00:36:10,385 --> 00:36:11,627
Ahh!

713
00:36:11,674 --> 00:36:13,162
Jesus.

714
00:36:13,209 --> 00:36:15,040
Alice is going full "Harry Potter"

715
00:36:15,087 --> 00:36:17,027
part seven/eight over there.

716
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:19,219
Oh, God. I hope we're winning.

717
00:36:23,603 --> 00:36:25,402
Damn it.

718
00:36:34,502 --> 00:36:36,135
Alice, what are you doing?

719
00:36:37,215 --> 00:36:39,694
No. Alice, don't. Stop, it'll...

720
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:41,296
What is she doing?

721
00:36:41,343 --> 00:36:42,605
She can't. She'll Niffin out.

722
00:36:42,652 --> 00:36:44,443
This is not good, Alice.

723
00:36:47,094 --> 00:36:48,398
Alice, stop!

724
00:36:48,445 --> 00:36:49,996
It's okay.

725
00:36:50,365 --> 00:36:52,425
I've got this, Quentin.

726
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:56,721
Alice, no!

727
00:37:05,799 --> 00:37:07,199
Alice!

728
00:37:10,658 --> 00:37:12,464
No!

729
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:22,386
Oops.

730
00:37:22,525 --> 00:37:24,148
Too far.

731
00:37:25,497 --> 00:37:27,229
Too bad.

732
00:37:29,002 --> 00:37:32,417
Let's finally finish this.

733
00:37:41,544 --> 00:37:43,476
I did it on purpose.

734
00:37:45,572 --> 00:37:47,230
Move.

735
00:37:48,526 --> 00:37:50,037
- Let's go.
- We have to go.

736
00:37:50,084 --> 00:37:51,917
Go on.

737
00:37:52,401 --> 00:37:54,636
Something you want to say?

738
00:37:55,635 --> 00:37:57,066
Alice.

739
00:37:57,272 --> 00:37:58,916
We can make a deal.

740
00:37:58,963 --> 00:38:01,472
Think of the fun we could have together.

741
00:38:01,767 --> 00:38:02,936
You don't have to...

742
00:38:02,983 --> 00:38:04,407
But I want to.

743
00:38:19,899 --> 00:38:21,729
Disappointing.

744
00:38:31,124 --> 00:38:32,956
Your turn.

745
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,802
Alice!

746
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,004
You got her attention. Now what?

747
00:38:51,816 --> 00:38:55,022
I'm sorry for all the times
I was a total dick to you.

748
00:38:55,069 --> 00:38:57,386
You're talking like you
mean something to me.

749
00:38:57,448 --> 00:38:59,512
Okay. Just...

750
00:39:01,016 --> 00:39:03,049
Alice. Don't.

751
00:39:09,683 --> 00:39:11,192
Go back.

752
00:39:11,239 --> 00:39:13,208
Quentin says go free.

753
00:39:28,338 --> 00:39:29,918
Fuck.

754
00:39:48,441 --> 00:39:50,138
Fuck.

755
00:39:59,347 --> 00:40:01,684
Alice.

756
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:03,988
Alice.

757
00:40:12,248 --> 00:40:14,716
Alice. Hey. Hey.

758
00:40:18,245 --> 00:40:20,770
Q, stop. You're hurt.

759
00:40:21,065 --> 00:40:23,418
Alice. Hey.

760
00:40:23,626 --> 00:40:24,728
You have to stop.

761
00:40:24,753 --> 00:40:26,283
Come on. She might be alive.

762
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:27,783
- Just stop.
- She might be alive.

763
00:40:27,846 --> 00:40:29,314
You have to stop.

764
00:40:29,439 --> 00:40:32,427
Q, you have to stop.

765
00:40:33,571 --> 00:40:35,322
You have to stop.

766
00:40:36,116 --> 00:40:38,041
You have to stop.
