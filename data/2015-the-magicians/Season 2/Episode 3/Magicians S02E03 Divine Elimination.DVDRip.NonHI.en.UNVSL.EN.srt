1
00:00:00,968 --> 00:00:02,903
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:07,185
A zillion bucks says The
Beast comes back any minute.

3
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:08,241
So what's the plan?

4
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:09,519
<i>Right, okay, so
here's the thing,</i>

5
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:10,687
<i>I can't really touch the knife.</i>

6
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:11,974
<i>We need the power of a god.</i>

7
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:15,504
I have gifted you my
bestowal. Imbibe it.

8
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:17,983
The more it burns,
the less time we have.

9
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:19,747
There's a spell that
seems strong enough.

10
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,550
These are my students. They
are in need of the Rhinemann Ultra.

11
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:25,616
<i>No one but you can be
within 20 feet of the blast.</i>

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,672
<i>Alice is going to take just a
few minutes to fully power up.</i>

13
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,427
This is a cacodemon.
They'll grow much bigger.

14
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:35,663
Unleash these and, believe me,
they'll keep The Beast plenty busy.

15
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,230
Do you know what a Niffin is?

16
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:39,296
No.

17
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:43,469
<i>It's when too much runs
through you. Only the magic is left.</i>

18
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:47,578
Please fix my hands.

19
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:49,879
<i>Go fuck yourself.</i>

20
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,043
I think I can help.

21
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:53,550
Wow. I owe you for real.

22
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,816
You could die if you don't
get clear of The Beast.

23
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,400
You think I don't know
how dangerous he is?

24
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:59,052
No. Not him. Us.

25
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:01,561
Yeah, do what you want with
him, but not until I get Reynard.

26
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:04,792
Well, we can't merely
summon him. A god can resist.

27
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:06,527
I don't give a shit
about getting him.

28
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,228
You should. I didn't summon him.

29
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:11,170
I didn't get raped by
him. I have no skin in this.

30
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,729
Reynard is targeting Hedges.

31
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:18,305
Did you put some kind
of curse on the castle?

32
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:19,378
Did I?

33
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:25,175
The spell that won World War
II is called the Rhinemann Ultra?

34
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:26,777
It sounds like a
not-so-great beer.

35
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:27,853
Fine, it's a beer.

36
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,399
But it's a beer that we
can use to kill The Beast.

37
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:32,689
Meanwhile, Penny comes back
with cool, circa-1985 wrist chains.

38
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,637
Yeah, super cool how they
keep me from killing myself.

39
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:36,806
And then Dean Fogg gives
you all matching tramp stamps?

40
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,390
I thought tramp stamps were
supposed to be on our lower back.

41
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:41,899
God, I feel like I missed
out on some crazy party

42
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:43,846
you'll be talking about
for the rest of your lives.

43
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,237
Say what you want, but we
brought back weapons and a plan.

44
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:47,786
What do you have
to show for yourself?

45
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:56,873
Ta-fucking-da!

46
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,613
Your royal accoutrements.

47
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:06,422
This is ceremony, people. And I
expect you to slather yourselves in it.

48
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:07,893
Thank you, Eliot.

49
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:09,662
I missed you all.

50
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,930
And I was bored.

51
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:13,728
Come, sit.

52
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:15,860
Is this really the
most important thing

53
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,734
we could be doing right now?

54
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,949
I mean, The Beast is still
out there, waiting for us, and...

55
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,532
The Beast can
wait for five minutes.

56
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:24,100
You are all Kings
and Queens of Fillory.

57
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,307
Well, almost all of you.

58
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,647
Just revel in your majesty
for one fucking second.

59
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,120
Be regal, miscreants.

60
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,257
Mmm...

61
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,989
You're such a
stupid, stupid man.

62
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:43,655
I'm gonna kill
you in your sleep.

63
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:46,032
Poison.

64
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:48,696
El, you okay?

65
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:50,302
Totally fine. Why?

66
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,239
It's just... You went
away there for a minute.

67
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,667
Nonsense. I feel
great. Have a seat.

68
00:02:57,077 --> 00:03:01,242
I'm kind of on a clock here.
So, we should talk strategy.

69
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:02,392
Yeah, we already
talked strategy.

70
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,593
So, we just need
to catch you up.

71
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:04,727
You've been planning without me?

72
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,414
Yeah. When we were on Earth.
What did you think we were doing?

73
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,953
Eliot, we're not trying to exclude
you. You just weren't there.

74
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:18,857
No. No, I wasn't, was I?

75
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,169
Don't think I don't
see how this works.

76
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:23,635
You disappear. You come back.

77
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:27,400
Matching tattoos. And now
you're three-against-one.

78
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,500
I know exactly what
you're planning. Eliot...

79
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:30,635
Don't touch me.

80
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,579
Sweetie, you kind
of sound insane.

81
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:35,675
Do I?

82
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:43,352
Because I promise you, I will
not go down easily, oo-surpers.

83
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,489
Usurpers.

84
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,793
Whichever way you're
supposed to pronounce it.

85
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:52,127
What just happened?

86
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:56,495
He got like this on 'shrooms
once. I'll go talk to him.

87
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,655
I just remembered
something that Julia said.

88
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:07,119
It's starting to
make a lot of sense.

89
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,978
You talked to that
bitch? Yes, he did.

90
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,129
It was a warning.
Something The Beast said.

91
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,515
Uh... God! Of course,
this makes sense!

92
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,988
Yeah, I mean, he'd want to
booby trap his kingdom, right?

93
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:19,049
Uh, so, apparently
he left curses behind.

94
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,220
Here, actually.

95
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,423
So, you think Eliot
might be cursed?

96
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:26,433
I mean, she was
vague. But, I mean...

97
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:29,602
Did either of you notice

98
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,365
that Eliot started
acting strangely

99
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,669
once he took a
drink from the goblet?

100
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:38,577
I mean, it could be
poison or potion...

101
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,346
Okay, well we probably shouldn't
drink from ours, just to be safe.

102
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,929
Or maybe it was just some primo
Fillorian shit that went up his nose

103
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,185
and he's on the bad end
of a trip, because he's him.

104
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:54,327
Did something happen to you?

105
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,794
Nope. Nothing.

106
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:58,862
I'm fine, Penny.

107
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:00,826
Oh.

108
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,997
Wait! And now you're doing it.

109
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:08,518
I don't know what
you're talking about.

110
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:11,137
I mean like Eliot, you're
acting all tweaky and shit.

111
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,639
We're fine. We're fine.

112
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:14,847
Clearly.

113
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,568
Look, I think we can all agree
that we have a problem here.

114
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,118
Eliot.

115
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:25,090
He's High King. He's cursed.
We have no choice but...

116
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,261
We have to kill him. Exactly.

117
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,124
The thrones.

118
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:32,460
You're both cursed.

119
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:37,170
This is hard for you. I get
that. It's hard for us, too.

120
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:38,466
But it must be done.

121
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,340
For Fillory. For Fillory.

122
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,313
But don't tell Quentin.

123
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,250
I'm going to have
to kill him, too.

124
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,948
Right after Margo.

125
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:06,394
Margo!

126
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:08,632
Margo.

127
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,866
Margo! Margo! Margo! We
got a serious problem, okay?

128
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,770
I know. Eliot's cursed. No, no.

129
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,360
Not just Eliot. Alice
and Quentin, too.

130
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:18,276
Listen, whatever you do, do
not sit on your throne, okay?

131
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:21,509
Fine. Whatevs. I have a plan.

132
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:22,913
You gonna help me pick these?

133
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,144
What's this? An antidote?

134
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,617
Exactly. For the poison.

135
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:26,685
For the... What?

136
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:29,112
For the poison.

137
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:32,554
I have to drink it first or I
won't get Eliot to take it.

138
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:38,057
Jesus, you're acting like
this is your first regicide.

139
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,430
Also, it's not the
thrones that are cursed.

140
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,969
I sat on mine
and I'm totally fine.

141
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:46,370
You sat on your... Fuck!

142
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,499
Great! No, it's good. Okay.

143
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,635
Stop! This will be over soon.

144
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,646
I'll deal with Eliot,
and Alice and Q.

145
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:55,321
Are you... You're welcome.

146
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:00,753
Shit.

147
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:22,774
So, this is our
little fox trap, huh?

148
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:24,402
Yeah.

149
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:27,290
So you wanna tell me where
you hooked up with your partner?

150
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:28,646
The Dirty Dozen?

151
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,941
Hmm. Uh...

152
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:33,481
Fillory.

153
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:36,756
Fine, don't tell me.

154
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,690
Listen, I'm here.
I want to help.

155
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:42,888
But that asshole seems like

156
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,261
severe psychic damage.

157
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:45,924
Look, I get it, okay?

158
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,831
But he knows a
spell to freeze a god.

159
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:49,981
I mean, you can't find that
at your local safe house.

160
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:53,229
Look, I've survived
this long on my instincts.

161
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,276
And every one of them is
telling me that he is bad news.

162
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:59,745
He's gonna turn on me.
Or you. Or both of us.

163
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:03,147
No, he can't. Okay, we have
an agreement. Word As Bond.

164
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,276
Oh, those are tough to break.

165
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:07,844
But if anyone could, it's
someone who could freeze a god.

166
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,983
Are you girls discussing
the nature of our agreement?

167
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,050
Marina was just asking.

168
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:17,529
Straightforward. I betray
her, she cuts me to the quick.

169
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:21,090
So, tell me, what happens after
the tenets of the agreement are met?

170
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,532
Why worry? You'll
be long gone by then.

171
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:26,072
So tell me. Are we ready?

172
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,640
Yeah.

173
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,577
<i>A hunting we will go
A hunting we will go</i>

174
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:36,582
<i>We'll catch a fox and put him
in a box And then we'll let him go</i>

175
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:40,185
What? Those are the lyrics.

176
00:08:47,427 --> 00:08:48,918
Benedict, right?

177
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:50,088
I need your help.

178
00:08:51,965 --> 00:08:53,331
What do you do here, again?

179
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,194
Royal mapmaker, sire. Is your
problem cartographical in nature?

180
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,432
Not really.

181
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:04,274
What I need, Benedict, is
a dagger. A stiletto, really.

182
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:07,473
Something I can sneak
up and stab someone with.

183
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:09,272
But regal.

184
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:13,080
I make maps, Your Majesty.

185
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:16,221
Well, surely someone
has snuck into your office

186
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,815
and dramatically stabbed a knife
into a map to make a point, no?

187
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,271
The other kings and
queens who died,

188
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:24,992
we'd always just thought
it was just infighting.

189
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,431
Greed and power.

190
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,576
Yeah, well, guess what?

191
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,677
It's just another horrible thing

192
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:30,636
The Beast is responsible for.

193
00:09:30,703 --> 00:09:32,569
So, how do we reverse this?

194
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:34,668
Curses are tricky.

195
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:35,936
You don't say.

196
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:40,009
They usually end once
they've run their course.

197
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,080
And not before.

198
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:42,843
That doesn't help us.

199
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,356
This one seems to wanna run
its course until they're all dead.

200
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:48,752
Shit. Dead.

201
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,189
I have an idea. Okay.

202
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:54,625
Do not let them kill each
other, okay? Mmm-hmm.

203
00:09:57,464 --> 00:10:01,162
I call on you, Our
Lady Underground.

204
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:09,166
As a Child of the Earth,
I seek you, O Mother.

205
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:11,438
Hey. Hmm?

206
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,476
Do me a favor
and just believe it.

207
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:18,408
A benevolent mommy
who will solve my problems

208
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:19,919
with her Gaia power?

209
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:23,449
Yeah. Or Reynard won't show.

210
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,483
You realize I don't even
own a pair of yoga pants.

211
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:30,424
So act.

212
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:46,912
I seek to know
you, Divine Mother.

213
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:51,110
Giver of life and light.

214
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:53,710
I ask to gaze upon you.

215
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:58,281
To hear your voice, to
feel the beating heart of you.

216
00:10:58,358 --> 00:11:01,226
I beseech you. Hear me now!

217
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:05,392
What happened?

218
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:06,827
Where are we?

219
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,732
A park. A few blocks away.

220
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:11,600
Is this a joke?
Take us back, now!

221
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,663
But we can't go back.

222
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,606
Reynard's scented you before.

223
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:17,701
If he smells you
again, he won't show.

224
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:22,215
If you want him, you might
just have to risk losing your bait.

225
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:24,945
I'm sorry. You're
saying this now?

226
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,850
Well, if I'd told you before,

227
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,411
would you have agreed to it?

228
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,680
Fine. I'll walk.

229
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,090
Oh, excellent idea.

230
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,954
By the time we arrive, he'll be so
engrossed in Marina's evisceration,

231
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:39,329
he won't even realize
we're there. You're good!

232
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,032
I ask to gaze upon you!

233
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,631
To hear your voice, to
feel the beating heart of you.

234
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,870
I ask to gaze upon you!

235
00:11:50,944 --> 00:11:54,540
To hear your voice, to
feel the beating heart of you!

236
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:03,647
Oh, you've got to be fucking
kidding. Fuck this noise!

237
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,529
What's so funny?

238
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:21,103
You with a crossbow.

239
00:12:21,174 --> 00:12:24,042
You couldn't hit a fat girl
with a fat-girl-seeking arrow.

240
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:28,448
Oh, don't give me that
look. It's a figure of speech.

241
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:31,308
No way in hell I'll miss
you from this range.

242
00:12:31,384 --> 00:12:35,378
Well. If you use that arrow
as good as you use your dick...

243
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,560
You enchanted
yourself, didn't you?

244
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:41,720
I'm not an idiot.

245
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,130
Margo says go free.

246
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:52,300
Fuck!

247
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:55,170
Jesus Christ!

248
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:56,521
Penny says go free.

249
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:16,053
You just had to let him save
you, huh? You're such a girl.

250
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:19,566
You know, I'd like to see you
dead regardless of your gender.

251
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,032
Just shut up, both of you.

252
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,932
I'm gonna take you
some place safe.

253
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,681
But if I have to shoot you to get
you there, I'll make sure it hurts.

254
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:27,765
Gee, thanks. But I'm enchanted.

255
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:31,174
Your enchantment's weak.

256
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,878
You shot me, you cock!

257
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:38,141
Why didn't you shoot her in the
neck? The carotid is right there.

258
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,291
Don't fret.

259
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:51,024
If Reynard had killed Marina,

260
00:13:51,097 --> 00:13:54,829
don't you think there'd be lots
of little Marina bits lying around?

261
00:13:54,901 --> 00:13:56,529
She ran.

262
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,434
And I don't think she
even finished the spell.

263
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:03,642
We're gonna have to start this all
over again. And now we've lost Marina.

264
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,354
I don't even know how
we're supposed to do...

265
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:08,712
Don't be so hasty. Are you
absolutely sure it didn't work?

266
00:14:09,549 --> 00:14:14,419
If I were your fox god, I might
just, say, follow her home,

267
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:16,752
rather than kill
her on the spot.

268
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,580
You knew this was
going to happen.

269
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:25,289
Why do you think I
took you out of there?

270
00:14:25,365 --> 00:14:28,858
Chin up! If I'm right, our
little summoning worked.

271
00:14:28,935 --> 00:14:32,599
We just need to find foxy
before he's finished with his prey.

272
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:33,705
<i>N'est-ce pas?</i>

273
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,797
You just locked us
both inside, you know.

274
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,000
You must be Marina.

275
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:14,740
Shit. Her wards are
up. We can't get inside.

276
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,544
Can you break them?

277
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:21,420
Uh-huh. Here.

278
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,016
There's one.

279
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:28,156
Settle in. This may take a bit.

280
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:34,065
Bad news, you're cursed.

281
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:37,433
Good news, I think
there's a way out.

282
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:38,835
Does it involve your beheading?

283
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:40,849
'Cause that's the ending
I'm voting for right now.

284
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,536
I second that.
My ass still hurts.

285
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,609
Enough.

286
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:47,342
Listen. I can't stop the curse.

287
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:50,406
So the plan is, we're
gonna let it run its course.

288
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:52,418
By killing you. All of you.

289
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:54,454
No likey. What's to likey?

290
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,250
The part where you're
dead sounds perfect.

291
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:57,346
Shut up!

292
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,822
Now, I took a little
trip to get supplies.

293
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:04,758
Oh, goody. Heroin.

294
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:07,757
I always suspected
this was how I'd go.

295
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,298
Potassium chloride
will shut down the heart.

296
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,067
Adrenaline will kickstart it.

297
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,406
You die. Curse
ends. I revive you.

298
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:20,504
Except, what if any part
of that plan doesn't work?

299
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,515
Look, asshole, you
don't like my idea,

300
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:23,659
why don't you go
find someone else

301
00:16:23,683 --> 00:16:25,618
to save your
annoying fucking life.

302
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:28,154
I have about 1,000 better
things to do with my day.

303
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:32,948
What the hell?

304
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,425
You okay? I'm fine.

305
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:42,629
My fingers are a little numb
due to the anti-curse things.

306
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:44,637
Well, that's just perfect.

307
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:47,970
It's fine. It's fine.

308
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,565
So, are we still
hostages, or what?

309
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:50,769
Yes. Yes, you are.

310
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:53,706
Um... You point that
thing at their fucking heads.

311
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:57,147
Everyone, please, please
just stand in your corners

312
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:58,707
and just quietly...

313
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:01,484
Dang it, Margo.

314
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:04,854
Yeah, yeah,
whatever. You're dead.

315
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,098
I suppose this is one way
to get the killing bit over with?

316
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:18,603
Yeah, this is what
I was planning.

317
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:23,533
The wards around this place
were deceptively advanced.

318
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:26,545
I'm impressed. You have talent.

319
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:29,548
Hmm. I bet you say
that to all the girls,

320
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,174
right before you
rape them, kill them

321
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,242
and eat their hearts.

322
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:36,414
You wear that
cynicism so stylishly.

323
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,253
It's too bad I know it's a lie.

324
00:17:38,324 --> 00:17:39,324
Is it?

325
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:43,094
Oh, no true cynic would
call to the goddess.

326
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:46,232
That must hurt, to know
she wasn't listening.

327
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:49,400
On the plus side, I was.

328
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,837
Listen, I love the
foreplay. It's hot.

329
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,032
It really is. But just get
it over with and kill me.

330
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:58,469
All in good time.

331
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:02,090
You know, it doesn't take Freud

332
00:18:02,114 --> 00:18:04,208
to see that a god who
likes to prey on chicks

333
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:07,720
is compensating for
a lack of something.

334
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:11,254
What even are you?

335
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:14,920
God of Goat Herding? Grapes?

336
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:16,656
Oh, wait, is it manure?

337
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,465
I bet you love coming here
and fucking with mortals

338
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:23,059
'cause back home in
god-land, you barely rank.

339
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,998
Watch your mouth, or
I'll slice out your tongue

340
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:27,700
and I'll eat it in front of you.

341
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,381
You're really not getting the
message that you don't scare me.

342
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:34,141
No, I think I do scare you.

343
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:46,785
It's so rare for someone to try to
summon Our Lady on their own.

344
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,657
You're all alone, aren't you?

345
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:51,323
There's no one
else in your life.

346
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:52,797
Seriously?

347
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,261
You're trying to
hurt my feelings?

348
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:56,768
And the best you
can come up with is

349
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:58,805
"why couldn't you find a man"?

350
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:00,700
Is anyone really
going to miss you?

351
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:03,569
I tip the pizza guy pretty well.

352
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,178
Ah...

353
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,311
You're not totally alone.

354
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:15,011
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

355
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:20,119
Cupcake?

356
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,217
What a cutie she is.

357
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:26,256
You witches and your familiars.

358
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,166
Hmm.

359
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,227
You don't care for people.

360
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:33,001
But you do love her, don't you?

361
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:37,643
Don't be stupid. She's just
a dumb cat. Put her down.

362
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:39,401
No.

363
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:41,744
I'd like to pet her.

364
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,041
Oh!

365
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:03,059
Look at that. I think she
might still be alive. That's funny.

366
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:06,171
Uh-uh!

367
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:09,702
No magic.

368
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:21,944
See? So much more fun to be had.

369
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:24,251
What's the rush?

370
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,095
Ha!

371
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:41,936
I won, bitches.

372
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:44,670
I'm High motherfucking Queen.

373
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,508
Get the other needles. Hurry!

374
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,138
Hey! Stay back!

375
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:49,624
Margo, we don't
have time for this.

376
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:50,707
We gotta revive them now!

377
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:52,274
What's best in life, Penny?

378
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,351
What?

379
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:54,853
What's best in life?

380
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:56,616
I don't know.

381
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:58,281
To crush your enemies,

382
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,121
see them driven before you

383
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,627
and hear the lamentations
of their women.

384
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:05,760
Come at me, farm girl.

385
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,206
That's one thorough
fucking curse.

386
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:17,443
Is it wrong to say I find her
death extremely satisfying?

387
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,206
Okay, come on. I need your help.

388
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:27,118
Oh, my God!

389
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:29,446
What the hell?

390
00:21:29,522 --> 00:21:32,390
Welcome back, loser. Yeah.

391
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:33,758
Um...

392
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,190
Do you want me to get that?

393
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:44,763
It's time.

394
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:48,967
Don't know how long I'll
have to cast the Rhinemann.

395
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:52,510
Ugh. Eliot's right.
It's a stupid name!

396
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:54,911
And I wish I had a beer.

397
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,091
That really doesn't look right.

398
00:21:56,115 --> 00:21:58,516
Does it require me
playing Rachmaninov?

399
00:21:58,584 --> 00:22:01,645
If not, we're fine.

400
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,240
No, but you still
gotta grab The Beast.

401
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:04,969
What happens if you
take the bracelets off?

402
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:06,735
That's a bad idea.
Well, then, how are you...

403
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:09,371
All I have to do is touch him,
right? So I'll tackle his ass. Okay?

404
00:22:09,395 --> 00:22:13,264
Well, we are down
two cacodemons.

405
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,392
Any ideas how to slow
up The Beast now?

406
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:18,801
Actually, we only
have one. I let mine go.

407
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:21,102
Oh, Jesus. Come on!

408
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,165
I could feel it.
Alive under my skin.

409
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:25,220
I couldn't stand the idea
of it being trapped in there.

410
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:26,678
Shocking no one.

411
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:29,271
Just leave her alone. It's not
like you have yours. I do. So...

412
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,647
Because you were too
much of a pussy to use it.

413
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:33,083
I got this, Q.

414
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,221
Okay, idea.

415
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,223
Do you guys remember
the Sumerian Shield Charm

416
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,519
we learned in PA?

417
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,392
Like, to keep you safe from
shattered glass or something?

418
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:45,192
Yeah, it's a simple spell, but
that doesn't mean it's not powerful.

419
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:47,175
Yeah, especially if all
three of us are casting it.

420
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:51,569
Use a first-year spell to stop The
Beast? That sounds like suicide.

421
00:22:51,637 --> 00:22:54,402
Which I've already tried
today, and no thank you.

422
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:57,466
Next. No! No! There is no next!

423
00:22:57,543 --> 00:23:00,980
We're running out of time
and options and god jizz.

424
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,015
Look, just imagine dicks, okay?

425
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:04,793
With one dick, you're
just jerking yourself off.

426
00:23:04,817 --> 00:23:08,185
But with three dicks, suddenly
you've got six people having sex.

427
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:09,517
Which is more powerful?

428
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:14,424
I think your metaphor literally
doesn't make any fucking sense.

429
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:15,493
It doesn't have to.

430
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:16,872
It just distracted
you long enough

431
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:18,262
for Alice to power up the spell.

432
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,892
Which is all the
shield charm has to do.

433
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:24,261
I see what you did there.

434
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,398
Struck a nerve, didn't I?

435
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:33,778
Sorry, I wasn't
paying attention.

436
00:23:33,846 --> 00:23:35,474
I fell asleep for a moment.

437
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:39,274
You ever eat
something still alive?

438
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:44,178
Can't say that I have.
Civilized species and all.

439
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:47,058
You're missing out.

440
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,356
I recommend
starting at the far end.

441
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:57,165
So you can enjoy
the fear. It's chemical.

442
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,065
You can taste it, fear.

443
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,968
Not to mention, the look
on your face is priceless.

444
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:08,905
So why don't you and I...

445
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:16,820
Apologies for the tardiness.
Your wards are rather extensive.

446
00:24:36,675 --> 00:24:37,836
Are we ready?

447
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:46,551
Hey.

448
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,159
Yeah.

449
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:28,017
He's fighting the net.

450
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:30,589
Not sure how much
longer I can hold this.

451
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:33,689
Jesus Christ, Julia. Would
you please just gut this guy?

452
00:25:33,766 --> 00:25:34,893
With pleasure.

453
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,465
No! No!

454
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:03,327
Now!

455
00:26:06,098 --> 00:26:07,157
Julia!

456
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,392
Blow that bitch up. Let's go!

457
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:11,269
No!

458
00:26:38,564 --> 00:26:39,588
No!

459
00:26:40,466 --> 00:26:42,697
I missed him! I missed him!

460
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:47,099
I missed him! I missed him!

461
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:49,141
I had Reynard. He
was right in front of me.

462
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:51,473
Yeah! And then you
screwed up our plan, again.

463
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:52,602
She just grabbed me.

464
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:54,306
No, you all don't understand.

465
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:56,439
I had Reynard. I had The Beast.

466
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:58,108
Man, fuck this. We're out.

467
00:27:03,489 --> 00:27:04,548
Get off me!

468
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,823
Where are we?
Where'd you take me?

469
00:27:06,892 --> 00:27:09,555
Subway's that way. Good
luck with your bullshit.

470
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,257
Hey! Take me back! I need him!

471
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:15,400
I need The Beast to kill
Reynard! Reynard has the knife.

472
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,611
I can't do it without The Beast.

473
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,659
It's not my problem.

474
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:21,396
Oh, shit. Duck!

475
00:27:24,443 --> 00:27:25,467
Shit!

476
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:26,544
What the hell?

477
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:28,890
The chain was the only thing
keeping my hands from fucking...

478
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:30,109
Put it back on! I can't!

479
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:32,048
It's a ritual and I
don't have any of the...

480
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,047
Oh, no.

481
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:38,847
Thank you. Yeah, no problem.

482
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:43,620
You fucking...

483
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:45,721
Sorry. Not my problem.

484
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:46,797
Fuck!

485
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:49,567
No!

486
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,451
He's injured. Where
else would he be?

487
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:57,807
He has to be at the Wellspring.

488
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,787
The Royal Carriage can
get there in under an hour.

489
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:01,055
Okay, but if he
can just blip in...

490
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:03,878
Well, hopefully his accuracy
isn't at its best right now.

491
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:05,076
I know mine wouldn't be.

492
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,228
Well, if those horses get
us there before The Beast,

493
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:09,164
- I'll gladly fuck them both.
- Hey!

494
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:12,647
Careful. Volume. I think
those are talking horses.

495
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:14,585
Offer stands.

496
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:18,393
Hey, can you still do this?

497
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:21,759
I don't know. What
choice do we have?

498
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,846
Okay, we should send
El and Margo for help.

499
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,430
Wait. You don't want us on
the suicide mission with you?

500
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:32,035
Ember's temple is nearby. So
just go and petition him for a re-up.

501
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,203
Just in case Alice and I...

502
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:34,404
Fail? Die?

503
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:37,342
Sorry. Reflex.

504
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:38,884
Okay, fine. We'll go.

505
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,431
Hey. Thought exercise.

506
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:02,107
Say we kill The
Beast, uh, what then?

507
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:05,905
Quentin, I don't know.

508
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:08,573
It's just... It's a distraction.

509
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:09,808
Come on.

510
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:14,848
Um...

511
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:18,281
I would, um...

512
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,295
I'd eat an ice cream sundae.

513
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:29,428
With whipped cream and those
fake, rainbow-colored sprinkles.

514
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:32,231
And, I don't know,
gummy bears on top.

515
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:35,831
I'm probably gonna
try and win you back.

516
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:37,205
Jesus, Quentin!

517
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:39,053
I'm sorry. It just sort
of flew out of my mouth.

518
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:41,103
You know, I'm not a prize.

519
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,074
I know that. But you
know what I mean.

520
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:45,515
No, and you didn't
just lose me like keys.

521
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:50,855
I know. Which is why I feel like
I need to earn back your trust.

522
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:52,515
This isn't fair.

523
00:29:53,592 --> 00:29:56,084
This isn't fair. You
can't trap me in here.

524
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:57,322
You can't trap me in here

525
00:29:57,396 --> 00:29:59,173
and expect me to deal with
all this heavy emotional shit

526
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:00,597
when all I can
handle right now...

527
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:03,111
All I can handle right now is a
goddamn ice cream sundae, okay?

528
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:04,467
It's not a trap.

529
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:05,780
Yes, it is. Then why
does it sound like

530
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:06,981
you're trying to fight with me?

531
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:09,873
Look. You've changed, okay?

532
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:15,073
You're not the girl that I met a
million years ago. You're amazing.

533
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:18,740
And not that you weren't
amazing before, but...

534
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:21,614
Quentin, where are
you going with this?

535
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:23,250
You've grown.

536
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:27,890
And you're still growing.
And my point is that I am, too.

537
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,757
Are you saying you're
not that guy anymore?

538
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,388
No, I'm saying that I'm
not just that guy anymore.

539
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:33,955
And I think that you should...

540
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:36,001
I hope that you give
me the opportunity

541
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:39,800
to be better and
actually deserve you.

542
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:41,897
And I know that
that sounds stupid,

543
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:45,341
but I feel like we
could die in like an hour

544
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:48,175
and that's giving me a
lot of clarity right now.

545
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:52,017
I don't know what
to say, Quentin.

546
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:56,351
Also I'm gonna make you the best
ice cream sundae you've ever had.

547
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:58,219
You're gonna
forget Popper No. 1,

548
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:01,454
and I'm even gonna put,
um, gummy bears on it.

549
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,806
Even though you don't understand

550
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,353
how absolutely
disgusting that is.

551
00:31:07,666 --> 00:31:08,998
Quentin...

552
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:20,509
I'm sorry. I just was in the
moment. Do you still wanna fight?

553
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:23,071
No.

554
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:32,889
Ember! Come out!

555
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:35,327
Hello?

556
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:38,387
I'm pretty sure Q said the whole
blood, stone thing works right away.

557
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:40,432
Fine. Give me your hand.

558
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:43,128
Just...

559
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:46,236
Oh, come on!

560
00:31:47,939 --> 00:31:48,998
Ow.

561
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:51,402
That kind of stings! Poor baby.

562
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:54,205
Great.

563
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:58,308
Well, now we're both bleeding.

564
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:00,443
Maybe Ember isn't home?

565
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:02,147
He's a god-in-exile.

566
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,654
<i>Where else could he be?</i>

567
00:32:03,722 --> 00:32:05,190
<i>I don't know.</i>

568
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:14,190
Mmm.

569
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,335
Ahh!

570
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:23,535
Greetings, O powerful
and glorious Martin Chatwin.

571
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:27,507
My goodness, only
half the man I remember.

572
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:29,810
You know what happens
if you stay in Fillory?

573
00:32:29,881 --> 00:32:30,905
I know. I know.

574
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:35,352
I'm leaving, I'm going. I just
had one or two things to do.

575
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,420
Mainly number two.

576
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:41,988
I have befouled the Wellspring.

577
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:43,661
Pardon me?

578
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:47,164
I have left my divine
elimination in the font of all magic.

579
00:32:47,232 --> 00:32:48,291
And it's a stinker.

580
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:50,344
I really hope you weren't
planning to drink from it.

581
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:51,392
It's hardly potable.

582
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,470
You...

583
00:32:53,138 --> 00:32:54,138
What?

584
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:59,440
Left my leavings. A
godly floater. Behind.

585
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:02,247
In the Wellspring.

586
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,776
I pooped in it. Am I not
making this very clear?

587
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:11,982
You wretched bastard.
I know your true game.

588
00:33:12,057 --> 00:33:16,495
I know it exactly. Every
twist, you stinking man-sheep!

589
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:21,363
Oh, my heavens, look at the
time. I really should be going.

590
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:24,631
Although technically,
I already went.

591
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:26,969
I never tire of these jokes. Ta!

592
00:33:40,886 --> 00:33:42,912
You stinking man-sheep!

593
00:33:42,988 --> 00:33:46,356
You're no god! You're no god!

594
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:49,121
You're a farm
animal! You're no god!

595
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,493
Ember actually took a
shit in the Wellspring?

596
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:53,054
You're a farm animal!

597
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:55,066
Well, that can't
be good for Fillory.

598
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:02,865
Quentin Coldwater!

599
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:04,441
Shit.

600
00:34:04,576 --> 00:34:07,375
Why don't you and
Alice come join me?

601
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:13,244
Mmm!

602
00:34:13,652 --> 00:34:14,915
You're weaker.

603
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,818
And you're down six fingers.

604
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,448
More than enough
to kill you both.

605
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:24,219
Hard to cast when
you're sliced in two.

606
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:31,802
Quentin!

607
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:35,439
You're a tough piece of
meat, aren't you? No matter.

608
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,564
I guess we're gonna die.

609
00:34:59,064 --> 00:35:00,498
To our pretty corpses.

610
00:35:00,999 --> 00:35:03,992
Children of Earth,
I have returned!

611
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:09,837
Spank my cheeks, you're
both royalty. How delightful.

612
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:12,837
You have come
here to beseech me?

613
00:35:14,179 --> 00:35:16,273
Well, um, yes.

614
00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:20,479
We have come to, uh,
beseech your, um, aid.

615
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:22,748
Of course. You shall have it.

616
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:26,047
Oh. Oh, but then
you're going to miss it!

617
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,854
Miss what? All the action!

618
00:35:28,193 --> 00:35:31,527
Between you and me, I think Alice
should make this a very good show.

619
00:35:32,197 --> 00:35:33,221
No promises, though.

620
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:35,426
Cheerio! Happy
ruling! Ember, we...

621
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:39,837
Great. Kicked us out before
we could even ask for the jizz.

622
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,904
Margo, look.

623
00:35:42,273 --> 00:35:43,473
Is that all you've got?

624
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,547
You're not even a real
Magician, are you, Martin?

625
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,542
You're just a scared little boy.

626
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,449
You wouldn't last
an hour at Brakebills.

627
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:08,591
Gah!

628
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:16,974
Jesus! Alice is going full <i>Harry
Potter</i> part seven/eight over there.

629
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:18,567
Oh, God, I hope we're winning.

630
00:36:23,048 --> 00:36:24,048
Damn it!

631
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,425
No, no. Alice,
what are you doing?

632
00:36:36,895 --> 00:36:39,490
No! Alice, don't. Stop! It'll...

633
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:40,759
What's she doing?

634
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,232
She can't, she'll Niffin out.

635
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,529
This is not good, Alice.

636
00:36:46,905 --> 00:36:47,964
Alice, stop!

637
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:51,373
It's okay. I've
got this, Quentin.

638
00:36:54,913 --> 00:36:56,211
Alice, no!

639
00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:06,657
Alice!

640
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:11,795
No!

641
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:21,498
Oops!

642
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:23,571
Too far.

643
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,469
Too bad.

644
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:31,742
Let's finally finish this.

645
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,784
I did it on purpose.

646
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:46,497
Move.

647
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:49,361
Let's go. We gotta go.

648
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:50,995
Go on.

649
00:37:52,237 --> 00:37:53,967
Something you want to say?

650
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:58,705
Alice, we could make a deal.

651
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:01,440
Think of the fun we
could have together.

652
00:38:01,513 --> 00:38:03,880
You don't have
to... But I want to.

653
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:21,222
Disappointing.

654
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:31,699
Your turn.

655
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:43,654
Alice!

656
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:50,485
Okay, you've got her
attention. Now what?

657
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:52,053
Uh...

658
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:55,566
I'm sorry for all the times
I was a total dick to you.

659
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:58,034
You're talking like you
mean something to me.

660
00:38:58,102 --> 00:38:59,661
Okay, just...

661
00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:03,207
Alice, don't.

662
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:11,281
Get back.

663
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,644
Quentin says go free.

664
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,863
Fuck!

665
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:50,387
Fuck.

666
00:40:00,465 --> 00:40:02,263
Alice?

667
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:04,393
Alice?

668
00:40:12,644 --> 00:40:15,113
Alice, hey, hey.

669
00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:21,018
Q! Stop, you're hurt.

670
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,821
Alice. Q.

671
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:27,188
You have to stop. No,
come on. She might be alive.

672
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,693
Just stop. You have
to stop. She might be...

673
00:40:30,295 --> 00:40:32,594
Q, you have to stop.

674
00:40:34,065 --> 00:40:35,590
You have to stop.

675
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:38,336
You have to stop.

676
00:40:39,837 --> 00:40:41,533
You have to stop.
