1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:01,808
<i>Previously on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:04,156 --> 00:00:06,101
Zillion bucks says The
Beast comes back any minute,

3
00:00:06,125 --> 00:00:07,257
so what's the plan?

4
00:00:07,292 --> 00:00:08,425
<i>Okay, so here's the thing.</i>

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,826
<i>I can't really touch the knife.</i>

6
00:00:09,862 --> 00:00:11,228
<i>We need the power of a god.</i>

7
00:00:11,263 --> 00:00:14,464
I have gifted you my
Bestowal. Imbibe it.

8
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,967
The more it burns,
the less time we have.

9
00:00:17,002 --> 00:00:18,735
There's a spell that
seems strong enough.

10
00:00:18,771 --> 00:00:19,970
These are my students.

11
00:00:20,005 --> 00:00:21,738
They are in need of the Rhinemann Ultra.

12
00:00:21,774 --> 00:00:25,409
<i>No one but you can be
within 20 feet of the blast.</i>

13
00:00:25,444 --> 00:00:27,477
<i>Alice is going to take
just a few minutes</i>

14
00:00:27,513 --> 00:00:28,645
<i>to fully power up.</i>

15
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,313
This is a cacodemon.

16
00:00:30,349 --> 00:00:31,349
It'll grow much bigger.

17
00:00:31,383 --> 00:00:32,816
Unleash these, and believe me,

18
00:00:32,851 --> 00:00:34,718
they'll keep The Beast plenty busy.

19
00:00:36,054 --> 00:00:38,321
- Do you know what a Niffin is?
- No.

20
00:00:38,357 --> 00:00:41,091
<i>It's when too much runs through you.</i>

21
00:00:41,126 --> 00:00:43,260
<i>Only the magic is left.</i>

22
00:00:43,295 --> 00:00:45,462
<i>Please... fix...</i>

23
00:00:45,497 --> 00:00:46,596
my hands.

24
00:00:46,632 --> 00:00:48,932
<i>Go... fuck... yourself?</i>

25
00:00:48,967 --> 00:00:50,267
I think I can help.

26
00:00:50,302 --> 00:00:52,536
- Wow.
- I owe you for real.

27
00:00:52,571 --> 00:00:54,449
You could die if you don't
get clear of The Beast.

28
00:00:54,473 --> 00:00:56,273
You think I don't know
how dangerous he is?

29
00:00:56,308 --> 00:00:58,041
No. Not him. Us.

30
00:00:58,076 --> 00:00:59,543
Yeah, do what you want with him,

31
00:00:59,578 --> 00:01:00,688
but not until I get Reynard.

32
00:01:00,712 --> 00:01:01,978
We can't merely summon him.

33
00:01:02,014 --> 00:01:03,814
A god can resist.

34
00:01:03,849 --> 00:01:05,549
I don't give a shit about getting him.

35
00:01:05,584 --> 00:01:07,384
- You should.
- I didn't summon him.

36
00:01:07,419 --> 00:01:09,119
<i>I didn't get raped by him.</i>

37
00:01:09,154 --> 00:01:10,187
I have no skin in this.

38
00:01:10,222 --> 00:01:11,721
Reynard is targeting hedges.

39
00:01:15,093 --> 00:01:17,327
Did you put some kind
of curse on the castle?

40
00:01:17,362 --> 00:01:18,562
Did I?

41
00:01:19,865 --> 00:01:21,832
The spell that won World War II

42
00:01:21,867 --> 00:01:23,967
is called the Rhinemann Ultra?

43
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:25,735
Sounds like a not-so-great beer.

44
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:27,649
Fine, it's a beer, but
it's a beer that we can use

45
00:01:27,673 --> 00:01:29,517
- to kill The Beast.
- Meanwhile, Penny comes back

46
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:31,675
with cool circa-1985 wrist chains.

47
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,656
Yeah, super cool how they
keep me from killing myself.

48
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,758
And then Dean Fogg gives you
all matching tramp stamps?

49
00:01:35,781 --> 00:01:37,147
I thought tramp stamps

50
00:01:37,182 --> 00:01:38,849
were supposed to be on our lower back?

51
00:01:38,884 --> 00:01:40,762
God, I feel like I missed
out on some crazy party

52
00:01:40,786 --> 00:01:42,764
you'll be talking about
for the rest of your lives.

53
00:01:42,788 --> 00:01:45,255
Say what you want, but we
brought back weapons and a plan.

54
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,190
What do you have to show for yourself?

55
00:01:50,929 --> 00:01:56,233
Ta... fucking... da.

56
00:01:57,369 --> 00:01:59,603
Your royal accoutrement.

57
00:01:59,638 --> 00:02:02,539
<i>This</i> is ceremony, people,

58
00:02:02,574 --> 00:02:05,842
and I expect you to
slather yourselves in it.

59
00:02:05,878 --> 00:02:06,843
Thank you, Eliot.

60
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:09,513
I missed you all.

61
00:02:09,548 --> 00:02:10,914
And I was bored.

62
00:02:11,394 --> 00:02:12,749
Come. Sit.

63
00:02:12,784 --> 00:02:14,751
Wait, is this really
the most important thing

64
00:02:14,786 --> 00:02:16,119
we could be doing right now?

65
00:02:16,154 --> 00:02:19,105
I mean, The Beast is still out there
waiting for us...

66
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,660
The Beast can wait for five minutes.

67
00:02:20,699 --> 00:02:23,426
You are all Kings and Queens of Fillory.

68
00:02:23,613 --> 00:02:25,228
Well, almost all of you.

69
00:02:25,355 --> 00:02:29,799
Just revel in your majesty
for one fucking second.

70
00:02:30,175 --> 00:02:32,285
Be regal, miscreants.

71
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:37,340
Mm.

72
00:02:38,847 --> 00:02:41,044
You're such a stupid, stupid, man.

73
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,612
I'm gonna kill you in your sleep.

74
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,651
El... El... El, you okay?

75
00:02:47,686 --> 00:02:49,753
Totally fine, why?

76
00:02:49,788 --> 00:02:50,887
It's just...

77
00:02:50,923 --> 00:02:52,166
you went away there for a minute.

78
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,391
Nonsense. I feel great.

79
00:02:54,862 --> 00:02:55,992
Have a seat.

80
00:02:56,299 --> 00:02:58,295
I'm kind of on a clock here,

81
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,230
so we should talk strategy.

82
00:03:00,265 --> 00:03:01,309
Yeah, we already talked strategy,

83
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:02,666
so we just need to catch you up.

84
00:03:02,701 --> 00:03:03,778
You've been planning without me?

85
00:03:03,802 --> 00:03:05,335
Yeah... when we were on Earth.

86
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,690
What did you think we were doing?

87
00:03:12,344 --> 00:03:13,821
Eliot, we're not trying to exclude you.

88
00:03:13,845 --> 00:03:15,512
You just weren't there.

89
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:18,009
No. No, I wasn't, was I?

90
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:21,184
Don't think I don't see how this works.

91
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:23,212
You disappear. You come back.

92
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:26,423
Matching tattoos, and now
you're three against one.

93
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,458
I know exactly what you're planning.

94
00:03:28,493 --> 00:03:30,515
- Don't touch me.
- Sweetie?

95
00:03:31,218 --> 00:03:33,263
You kind of sound insane.

96
00:03:33,298 --> 00:03:34,484
Do I?

97
00:03:37,609 --> 00:03:40,937
Because I promise you...
I will not go down easily.

98
00:03:40,973 --> 00:03:42,570
Oo-surpers.

99
00:03:44,836 --> 00:03:47,177
Usurpers.

100
00:03:47,336 --> 00:03:49,813
Whichever way you're
supposed to pronounce it.

101
00:03:49,848 --> 00:03:51,047
What just happened?

102
00:03:51,383 --> 00:03:53,539
He got like this on shrooms once.

103
00:03:53,938 --> 00:03:55,685
I'll go talk to him.

104
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,628
<i>I just remembered
something that Julia said,</i>

105
00:04:04,663 --> 00:04:06,201
and it's starting to
make a lot of sense.

106
00:04:06,225 --> 00:04:07,897
- You talked to that bitch?
- Yes, he did.

107
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:10,133
It was a warning.
Something The Beast said.

108
00:04:10,168 --> 00:04:13,169
Uh... God, of course. It makes sense.

109
00:04:13,205 --> 00:04:15,080
I mean, he'd want to
booby-trap his kingdom, right?

110
00:04:15,104 --> 00:04:19,009
So apparently, he left curses behind.

111
00:04:19,463 --> 00:04:21,211
Here, actually.

112
00:04:21,463 --> 00:04:23,413
So you think Eliot might be cursed?

113
00:04:23,448 --> 00:04:25,215
I mean, she was vague, but I mean...

114
00:04:27,455 --> 00:04:28,518
Did either of you notice

115
00:04:28,553 --> 00:04:30,387
that Eliot started acting strangely

116
00:04:30,422 --> 00:04:32,713
once he took a drink from the goblet?

117
00:04:33,651 --> 00:04:37,794
I mean, it could be poison or a potion.

118
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:43,533
All right, well, we probably shouldn't
drink from ours just to be safe.

119
00:04:43,568 --> 00:04:44,779
Or maybe it was just some primo

120
00:04:44,803 --> 00:04:46,247
Fillorian shit that went up his nose,

121
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:47,963
and he's on the bad end of a trip

122
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:49,627
because he's him.

123
00:04:52,049 --> 00:04:53,276
Did something happen to you?

124
00:04:53,311 --> 00:04:55,111
Nope. Nothing.

125
00:04:55,596 --> 00:04:57,666
I'm fine... Penny.

126
00:05:03,424 --> 00:05:06,089
Wait. And now you're doing it.

127
00:05:06,124 --> 00:05:07,514
I don't know what you're talking about.

128
00:05:07,538 --> 00:05:08,792
I mean like Eliot.

129
00:05:08,827 --> 00:05:10,406
You're acting all tweaky and shit.

130
00:05:10,438 --> 00:05:11,844
We're fine.

131
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:13,763
Clearly.

132
00:05:14,094 --> 00:05:16,875
Look, I think we can all agree
that we have a problem here.

133
00:05:17,258 --> 00:05:18,352
Eliot.

134
00:05:19,149 --> 00:05:22,405
He's High King. He's cursed.

135
00:05:22,535 --> 00:05:25,642
- We have no choice but...
- We have to kill him.

136
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:27,210
Exactly.

137
00:05:27,738 --> 00:05:28,973
The thrones.

138
00:05:30,145 --> 00:05:31,567
They're both cursed.

139
00:05:31,692 --> 00:05:34,718
This is hard for you. I get that.

140
00:05:34,753 --> 00:05:36,219
It's hard for us too.

141
00:05:36,254 --> 00:05:37,635
But it must be done.

142
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:41,010
For Fillory.

143
00:05:48,532 --> 00:05:50,166
But don't tell Quentin...

144
00:05:50,306 --> 00:05:52,235
I'm going to have to kill him too.

145
00:05:52,337 --> 00:05:53,947
Right after Margo.

146
00:06:04,049 --> 00:06:05,322
Margo?

147
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,478
Margo.

148
00:06:07,751 --> 00:06:10,587
Margo. Margo. Margo.
We got a serious problem, okay?

149
00:06:10,845 --> 00:06:12,288
I know. Eliot's cursed.

150
00:06:12,324 --> 00:06:14,324
No, no. Not just Eliot.
Alice and Quentin too.

151
00:06:14,359 --> 00:06:17,193
Listen, whatever you do, do
not sit on your throne, okay?

152
00:06:17,229 --> 00:06:20,196
Fine. Whatevs. I have a plan.

153
00:06:20,565 --> 00:06:21,931
You gonna help me pick these?

154
00:06:21,967 --> 00:06:23,133
What's this? An antidote?

155
00:06:23,168 --> 00:06:24,601
Exactly. For the poison.

156
00:06:24,636 --> 00:06:25,946
For the... what?

157
00:06:27,063 --> 00:06:28,548
For the poison.

158
00:06:28,782 --> 00:06:31,829
I have to drink it first, or
I won't get Eliot to take it.

159
00:06:33,305 --> 00:06:37,013
Jesus. You're acting like
this is your first regicide.

160
00:06:37,048 --> 00:06:39,449
Also, it's not the
thrones that are cursed.

161
00:06:39,484 --> 00:06:41,782
I sat on mine, and I'm totally fine.

162
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,290
You sat on your...

163
00:06:44,022 --> 00:06:45,221
Fuck...

164
00:06:45,257 --> 00:06:46,649
Great. No, it's good.

165
00:06:46,758 --> 00:06:48,358
- Okay.
- Stop.

166
00:06:48,618 --> 00:06:49,718
This'll be over soon.

167
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,762
I'll deal with Eliot and Alice and Q.

168
00:06:53,415 --> 00:06:54,610
You're welcome.

169
00:06:58,798 --> 00:06:59,798
Shit.

170
00:07:05,321 --> 00:07:09,938
synced and corrected by susinz
www.addic7ed.com

171
00:07:18,758 --> 00:07:21,991
So, this is our little fox trap, huh?

172
00:07:22,141 --> 00:07:23,266
Yeah.

173
00:07:23,923 --> 00:07:26,477
So, you want to tell me
where you hooked up with your partner?

174
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:27,864
The Dirty Dozen?

175
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:31,938
Ah. Fillory.

176
00:07:34,227 --> 00:07:35,872
Fine. Don't tell me.

177
00:07:38,415 --> 00:07:40,694
Listen, I'm here. I want to help.

178
00:07:40,719 --> 00:07:43,063
But that asshole seems
like severe psychic damage.

179
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,649
Look, I get it, okay?

180
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,716
But he knows a spell to freeze a god.

181
00:07:46,751 --> 00:07:49,001
I mean, you can't find that
at your local safe house.

182
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,222
Look, I have survived
this long on my instincts,

183
00:07:52,257 --> 00:07:54,123
and every one of them is telling me

184
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,523
that he is bad news.

185
00:07:55,548 --> 00:07:56,459
He's gonna turn on me.

186
00:07:56,494 --> 00:07:58,728
Or you. Or both of us.

187
00:07:58,763 --> 00:08:01,130
He can't, okay? We have an agreement.

188
00:08:01,246 --> 00:08:02,330
Word as bond.

189
00:08:02,355 --> 00:08:03,855
Those are tough to break.

190
00:08:04,457 --> 00:08:07,160
But if anyone could, it's someone
who could freeze a god.

191
00:08:07,722 --> 00:08:11,519
Are you girls discussing
the nature of our agreement?

192
00:08:11,972 --> 00:08:13,033
Marina was just asking.

193
00:08:13,058 --> 00:08:14,246
Straightforward.

194
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,446
I betray her, she cuts me to the quick.

195
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:18,448
So, tell me, what
happens after the tenets

196
00:08:18,483 --> 00:08:20,116
of the agreement are met?

197
00:08:20,268 --> 00:08:22,479
Why worry? You'll be long gone by then.

198
00:08:22,706 --> 00:08:25,292
So, tell me. Are we ready?

199
00:08:26,698 --> 00:08:27,698
Yeah.

200
00:08:28,034 --> 00:08:31,561
♪ A-hunting we will go,
a-hunting we will go ♪

201
00:08:31,776 --> 00:08:33,341
♪ We'll catch a fox and
put him in a box ♪

202
00:08:33,365 --> 00:08:35,393
♪ And then we'll let him go ♪

203
00:08:36,893 --> 00:08:39,354
What? Those are the lyrics.

204
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,658
Benedict, right?

205
00:08:48,033 --> 00:08:49,112
I need your help.

206
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:52,462
What do you do here again?

207
00:08:53,134 --> 00:08:54,570
Royal mapmaker, sire.

208
00:08:54,595 --> 00:08:57,391
Is your problem
cartographical in nature?

209
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:58,454
Not really.

210
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,591
What I need, Benedict, is a dagger.

211
00:09:01,723 --> 00:09:03,153
A stiletto, really.

212
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:06,653
Something I can sneak
up and stab someone with.

213
00:09:07,165 --> 00:09:08,331
But regal.

214
00:09:10,309 --> 00:09:11,903
I make maps, Your Majesty.

215
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,458
Well,... surely, someone has
snuck into your office

216
00:09:15,483 --> 00:09:18,293
and dramatically stabbed a knife
into a map to make a point, no?

217
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:20,955
The other Kings and Queens who died...

218
00:09:20,979 --> 00:09:23,746
we'd always just thought
it was just infighting.

219
00:09:23,782 --> 00:09:25,448
Greed and power.

220
00:09:25,483 --> 00:09:27,350
Guess what? It's just
another horrible thing

221
00:09:27,385 --> 00:09:31,521
The Beast was responsible
for, so how do we reverse this?

222
00:09:31,961 --> 00:09:33,554
Curses are tricky.

223
00:09:33,692 --> 00:09:35,226
You don't say.

224
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:38,859
They usually end once
they've run their course.

225
00:09:39,172 --> 00:09:40,256
And not before.

226
00:09:40,281 --> 00:09:41,468
That doesn't help us.

227
00:09:41,937 --> 00:09:44,457
This one seems to want to run its
course until they're all dead.

228
00:09:45,492 --> 00:09:47,851
Shit. Dead.

229
00:09:48,836 --> 00:09:49,945
- I have an idea.
- Okay.

230
00:09:50,211 --> 00:09:52,664
<i>Do not</i> let them kill each other, okay?

231
00:09:52,711 --> 00:09:53,711
Mm-hmm.

232
00:09:56,422 --> 00:09:57,984
<i>I call on you.</i>

233
00:09:58,242 --> 00:10:00,422
Our Lady Underground.

234
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,226
As a child of the Earth...

235
00:10:05,242 --> 00:10:08,453
I seek you, O Mother.

236
00:10:09,148 --> 00:10:10,758
- Hey.
- Mm?

237
00:10:11,234 --> 00:10:14,554
Do me a favor and just believe it.

238
00:10:15,328 --> 00:10:17,166
A benevolent Mommy who
will solve my problems

239
00:10:17,202 --> 00:10:19,136
with her Gaia power?

240
00:10:20,222 --> 00:10:22,714
Yeah. Or Reynard won't show.

241
00:10:23,847 --> 00:10:26,183
You realize I don't even
own a pair of yoga pants.

242
00:10:28,113 --> 00:10:29,144
So act.

243
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,292
I seek to know you, Divine Mother.

244
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,206
Giver of life and light.

245
00:10:50,542 --> 00:10:52,702
I ask to gaze upon you.

246
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,644
To hear your voice.

247
00:10:55,066 --> 00:10:57,273
To feel the beating heart of you.

248
00:10:57,503 --> 00:11:00,243
I beseech you. Hear me now.

249
00:11:03,175 --> 00:11:05,503
What happened? Where are we?

250
00:11:05,824 --> 00:11:07,644
A park. Few blocks away.

251
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,553
Is this a joke? Take us back now.

252
00:11:10,588 --> 00:11:12,394
Well, we can't go back.

253
00:11:12,628 --> 00:11:14,590
Reynard's scented you before.

254
00:11:14,626 --> 00:11:16,659
If he smells you again, he won't show.

255
00:11:16,941 --> 00:11:18,795
If you want him,

256
00:11:19,042 --> 00:11:21,308
you might just have to
risk losing your bait.

257
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:23,966
I'm sorry. You're saying this now?

258
00:11:24,144 --> 00:11:27,470
Well, if I'd told you before,
would you have agreed to it?

259
00:11:28,136 --> 00:11:29,613
Fine. I'll walk.

260
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,347
Oh, excellent idea.

261
00:11:31,417 --> 00:11:32,642
By the time we arrive,

262
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,844
he'll be so engrossed
in Marina's evisceration,

263
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:37,080
he won't even realize we're there.

264
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:38,574
You're good.

265
00:11:43,011 --> 00:11:46,255
I ask to gaze upon
you. To hear your voice.

266
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,690
To feel the beating heart of you.

267
00:11:47,725 --> 00:11:50,960
I ask to gaze upon
you! To hear your voice!

268
00:11:51,018 --> 00:11:53,398
To feel the beating heart of you!

269
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:00,570
Oh, you've got to be fucking kidding.

270
00:12:02,077 --> 00:12:03,206
Fuck this noise.

271
00:12:16,406 --> 00:12:17,487
What's so funny?

272
00:12:17,921 --> 00:12:19,632
You with a crossbow.

273
00:12:20,218 --> 00:12:23,242
You couldn't hit a fat girl
with a fat-girl-seeking arrow.

274
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:25,826
Oh, don't give me that look.

275
00:12:25,874 --> 00:12:27,640
It's a figure of speech.

276
00:12:28,273 --> 00:12:30,333
No way in hell I'll
miss you from this range.

277
00:12:30,429 --> 00:12:34,337
Well, if you use that arrow
as good as you use your dick...

278
00:12:38,054 --> 00:12:39,562
You enchanted yourself, didn't you?

279
00:12:39,656 --> 00:12:40,710
I'm not an idiot.

280
00:12:42,656 --> 00:12:45,348
Margo says go free.

281
00:12:49,954 --> 00:12:51,171
Oh, fuck...

282
00:12:52,835 --> 00:12:54,248
Jesus Christ.

283
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,591
Penny says go free.

284
00:13:07,438 --> 00:13:08,504
Aah!

285
00:13:11,442 --> 00:13:13,409
You just had to let him save you, huh?

286
00:13:13,874 --> 00:13:15,037
You're such a girl.

287
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:16,712
You know, I would like to see you dead

288
00:13:16,748 --> 00:13:18,248
regardless of your gender.

289
00:13:18,273 --> 00:13:19,890
Shut up. Both of you.

290
00:13:20,312 --> 00:13:22,084
I'm gonna take you someplace safe,

291
00:13:22,109 --> 00:13:23,264
but if I have to shoot
you to get you there,

292
00:13:23,288 --> 00:13:24,726
I will make sure it hurts.

293
00:13:24,827 --> 00:13:26,389
Gee, thanks, but I'm enchanted.

294
00:13:27,452 --> 00:13:28,492
Aah!

295
00:13:28,906 --> 00:13:30,342
Your enchantment's weak.

296
00:13:30,367 --> 00:13:31,632
Aah!

297
00:13:32,054 --> 00:13:34,030
You shot me, you cock.

298
00:13:34,476 --> 00:13:37,280
Why didn't you shoot her in the neck?
The carotid is right there.

299
00:13:46,648 --> 00:13:47,960
Don't fret.

300
00:13:48,538 --> 00:13:50,170
If Reynard had killed Marina,

301
00:13:50,195 --> 00:13:53,671
don't you think there'd be lots of
little Marina bits lying around?

302
00:13:53,696 --> 00:13:54,937
She ran.

303
00:13:55,593 --> 00:13:57,710
I don't think she even
finished the spell.

304
00:13:58,687 --> 00:14:01,090
We're gonna have to
start this all over again,

305
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,717
and now we've lost Marina.

306
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:04,171
I don't even know how
we're supposed to do...

307
00:14:04,195 --> 00:14:05,494
Don't be so hasty.

308
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,843
Are you absolutely sure it didn't work?

309
00:14:08,507 --> 00:14:09,732
If I were your fox god,

310
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:13,187
I might just, say, follow her home

311
00:14:13,476 --> 00:14:15,406
rather than kill her on the spot.

312
00:14:20,273 --> 00:14:21,959
You knew this was going to happen.

313
00:14:21,984 --> 00:14:23,882
Why do you think I
took you out of there?

314
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:27,650
Chin up. If I'm right, our
little summoning worked.

315
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:29,462
We just need to find foxy

316
00:14:29,487 --> 00:14:32,528
before he's finished with
his prey, n'est-ce pas?

317
00:14:55,356 --> 00:14:57,723
You just locked us
both inside, you know?

318
00:14:59,723 --> 00:15:01,278
You must be Marina.

319
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,004
Shit. Her wards are up.

320
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:12,254
We can't get inside.

321
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:14,606
Can you break them?

322
00:15:17,005 --> 00:15:18,965
Aha. Here.

323
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,192
That's one.

324
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:25,590
Settle in. This may take a bit.

325
00:15:28,129 --> 00:15:31,340
Bad news... you're cursed.

326
00:15:31,762 --> 00:15:34,411
Good news... I think there's a way out.

327
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,184
Does it involve your beheading?

328
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:37,904
'Cause that's the ending
I'm voting for right now.

329
00:15:37,928 --> 00:15:40,567
I second that. My ass still hurts.

330
00:15:40,592 --> 00:15:41,684
Enough!

331
00:15:41,981 --> 00:15:43,029
Listen.

332
00:15:43,065 --> 00:15:44,698
I can't stop the curse,

333
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:47,411
so the plan is we're gonna
let it run its course.

334
00:15:47,567 --> 00:15:49,669
By killing you. All of you.

335
00:15:49,705 --> 00:15:51,705
- No likey.
- What's to likey?

336
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,807
The part where you're
dead sounds perfect.

337
00:15:53,842 --> 00:15:54,981
Shut up.

338
00:15:56,044 --> 00:15:58,145
Now, I took a little
trip to get supplies.

339
00:15:59,581 --> 00:16:02,036
Oh, goody. Heroin.

340
00:16:02,825 --> 00:16:05,058
I always suspected this was how I'd go.

341
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:08,098
Potassium chloride will
shut down the heart.

342
00:16:08,442 --> 00:16:10,739
Adrenaline will kick-start it.

343
00:16:11,364 --> 00:16:14,661
You die. Curse ends. I revive you.

344
00:16:14,696 --> 00:16:17,697
Except what if any part
of that plan doesn't work?

345
00:16:17,733 --> 00:16:19,733
Look, asshole. You don't like my idea,

346
00:16:19,768 --> 00:16:21,079
why don't you go find someone else

347
00:16:21,103 --> 00:16:22,669
to save your annoying fucking life?

348
00:16:22,767 --> 00:16:25,032
I have about a thousand better
things to do with my day.

349
00:16:28,543 --> 00:16:29,876
What the hell?

350
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,602
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

351
00:16:35,642 --> 00:16:39,886
My fingers are a little numb
due to the anti-curse things.

352
00:16:39,921 --> 00:16:41,855
Well, that's just perfect.

353
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,501
It's fine.

354
00:16:43,556 --> 00:16:45,095
Uh, it's fine.

355
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,860
So, are we still hostages or what?

356
00:16:46,885 --> 00:16:48,446
Yes. Yes, you are.

357
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:50,908
Would you point that thing
at their fucking heads?

358
00:16:50,932 --> 00:16:52,332
Everyone please,

359
00:16:52,367 --> 00:16:54,124
please just stand in your corners

360
00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:55,869
and just quietly...

361
00:16:57,118 --> 00:17:00,196
- Dang it, Margo.
- Yeah, yeah. Whatever.

362
00:17:00,852 --> 00:17:02,079
You're dead.

363
00:17:10,051 --> 00:17:12,610
I suppose this is one way to
get the killing bit over with?

364
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,446
Yeah.

365
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:16,149
This is what I was planning.

366
00:17:16,563 --> 00:17:20,704
The wards around this place
were deceptively advanced.

367
00:17:21,048 --> 00:17:23,657
I'm impressed. You have talent.

368
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:26,933
I bet you say that to all the girls

369
00:17:26,968 --> 00:17:29,806
right before you rape them,
kill them, and eat their hearts.

370
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,774
You wear that cynicism so stylishly.

371
00:17:33,642 --> 00:17:35,337
It's too bad I know it's a lie.

372
00:17:35,577 --> 00:17:36,665
Is it?

373
00:17:37,649 --> 00:17:40,071
No true cynic would call to the Goddess.

374
00:17:40,816 --> 00:17:43,532
That must hurt, to know
she wasn't listening.

375
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:46,415
On the plus side, I was.

376
00:17:46,868 --> 00:17:48,321
Listen, I love the foreplay.

377
00:17:48,356 --> 00:17:50,123
It's hot. It really is.

378
00:17:50,158 --> 00:17:51,954
But just get it over with and kill me...

379
00:17:54,149 --> 00:17:55,662
All in good time.

380
00:17:57,884 --> 00:17:59,199
You know, it doesn't take Freud

381
00:17:59,234 --> 00:18:01,467
to see that a god who
likes to prey on chicks

382
00:18:01,503 --> 00:18:04,985
is compensating for
a lack of... something.

383
00:18:06,349 --> 00:18:07,935
What even are you?

384
00:18:08,428 --> 00:18:10,201
God of Goat Herding?

385
00:18:10,654 --> 00:18:12,045
Grapes?

386
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:13,506
Oh, wait. Is it Manure?

387
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,584
I bet you love coming here
and fucking with mortals

388
00:18:17,619 --> 00:18:20,107
'cause back home in
god-land, you barely rank.

389
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:23,122
Watch your mouth, or I'll
slice out your tongue,

390
00:18:23,158 --> 00:18:24,855
and I'll eat it in front of you.

391
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:28,527
You're really not getting the
message that you don't scare me.

392
00:18:28,552 --> 00:18:31,074
Oh, I think I do scare you.

393
00:18:39,174 --> 00:18:43,097
So rare for someone to try to
summon Our Lady on their own.

394
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,800
You're all alone, aren't you?

395
00:18:45,981 --> 00:18:48,519
There's... no else in your life.

396
00:18:48,917 --> 00:18:50,042
Seriously?

397
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:52,518
Trying to hurt my feelings?

398
00:18:52,554 --> 00:18:53,798
And the best you can come up with

399
00:18:53,822 --> 00:18:56,022
is "why couldn't you find a man?"

400
00:18:56,183 --> 00:18:58,136
Is anyone really gonna miss you?

401
00:18:58,925 --> 00:19:00,605
I tip the pizza guy pretty well.

402
00:19:00,917 --> 00:19:01,917
Hmm

403
00:19:03,204 --> 00:19:04,449
Ah...

404
00:19:06,768 --> 00:19:08,446
You're not totally alone.

405
00:19:09,477 --> 00:19:12,405
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

406
00:19:13,675 --> 00:19:14,813
Aww

407
00:19:15,626 --> 00:19:16,733
Cupcake?

408
00:19:17,946 --> 00:19:19,274
What a cutie she is.

409
00:19:20,149 --> 00:19:23,649
You witches and your familiars.

410
00:19:24,452 --> 00:19:27,313
Hmm. You don't care for people,

411
00:19:28,266 --> 00:19:30,227
but you do love her, don't you?

412
00:19:31,459 --> 00:19:32,712
Don't be stupid.

413
00:19:33,001 --> 00:19:35,361
She's just a dumb cat. Put her down.

414
00:19:35,397 --> 00:19:38,876
No. I'd like to pet her.

415
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:57,278
Oh. Look at that.

416
00:19:57,372 --> 00:19:59,352
I think she might still be alive.

417
00:19:59,387 --> 00:20:00,911
That's funny.

418
00:20:02,551 --> 00:20:03,551
Uh-uh.

419
00:20:05,727 --> 00:20:06,727
No magic.

420
00:20:08,598 --> 00:20:09,716
Aah!

421
00:20:16,012 --> 00:20:17,012
See?

422
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:19,403
So much more fun to be had.

423
00:20:20,108 --> 00:20:21,411
What's the rush?

424
00:20:36,231 --> 00:20:41,684
Ha! I won, bitches. I'm
High motherfucking Queen.

425
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:43,763
Get the other needles. Hurry.

426
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:45,431
Hey! Stay back.

427
00:20:45,467 --> 00:20:46,677
Margo, we don't have time for this.

428
00:20:46,701 --> 00:20:47,800
We got to revive 'em now.

429
00:20:47,836 --> 00:20:49,569
What's best in life, Penny?

430
00:20:49,604 --> 00:20:50,471
What?

431
00:20:50,496 --> 00:20:52,138
What's best in life?

432
00:20:52,338 --> 00:20:53,906
I don't know.

433
00:20:53,942 --> 00:20:57,076
To crush your enemies,
see them driven before you,

434
00:20:57,112 --> 00:20:59,812
and hear the lamentations
of their women.

435
00:21:01,081 --> 00:21:03,174
Come at me, farm girl.

436
00:21:08,698 --> 00:21:11,479
That's one thorough fucking curse.

437
00:21:11,596 --> 00:21:14,495
Is it wrong to say I find her
death extremely satisfying?

438
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,029
Okay, come on. I need your help.

439
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:22,859
Oh, my God.

440
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,273
What the hell?

441
00:21:25,308 --> 00:21:27,960
Welcome back. Loser.

442
00:21:30,013 --> 00:21:31,882
Do you want me to get that?

443
00:21:32,449 --> 00:21:33,671
Aah...

444
00:21:39,437 --> 00:21:40,562
It's time.

445
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:44,765
Don't know how long I'll
have to cast the Rhinemann.

446
00:21:45,781 --> 00:21:48,296
Ugh. Eliot's right. It's a stupid name.

447
00:21:48,331 --> 00:21:50,093
And I wish I had a beer.

448
00:21:50,327 --> 00:21:51,671
That really doesn't look right.

449
00:21:51,785 --> 00:21:54,074
Does it require me playing Rachmaninoff?

450
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:57,472
If not... we're fine.

451
00:21:57,507 --> 00:21:59,018
Look, you still got to grab The Beast.

452
00:21:59,042 --> 00:22:00,742
What happens if you
take the bracelets off?

453
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,521
- That's a bad idea.
- Well, then, how are you...

454
00:22:02,545 --> 00:22:03,956
All I have to do is touch him, right?

455
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,179
So I'll tackle his ass, okay?

456
00:22:05,215 --> 00:22:08,738
Well, we are down two cacodemons.

457
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:11,238
Any ideas how to slow up The Beast now?

458
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:13,355
Actually, we only have one.

459
00:22:13,523 --> 00:22:14,622
I let mine go.

460
00:22:14,658 --> 00:22:16,808
Oh, Jesus. Come on.

461
00:22:16,894 --> 00:22:18,926
I could feel it. Alive and in my skin.

462
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:21,040
I couldn't stand the idea
of it being trapped in there.

463
00:22:21,064 --> 00:22:23,031
- Shocking no one.
- Just leave her alone.

464
00:22:23,066 --> 00:22:25,099
It's not like you
have yours. I do, so...

465
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,512
Because you were too much of a pussy

466
00:22:26,536 --> 00:22:27,468
to use it.

467
00:22:27,504 --> 00:22:28,691
I got this, Q.

468
00:22:29,926 --> 00:22:31,840
Okay. Idea.

469
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:34,175
Do you guys remember
the Sumerian shield charm

470
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,309
we learned in PA?

471
00:22:35,777 --> 00:22:36,577
Like, to keep you safe

472
00:22:36,613 --> 00:22:38,179
from shattered glass or something?

473
00:22:38,316 --> 00:22:39,814
It's a simple spell,

474
00:22:39,849 --> 00:22:41,227
but that doesn't mean it's not powerful.

475
00:22:41,251 --> 00:22:42,995
Especially if all three
of us are casting it.

476
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:45,987
Use a first-year spell
to stop The Beast?

477
00:22:46,043 --> 00:22:47,388
That sounds like suicide.

478
00:22:47,424 --> 00:22:49,023
Which I've already tried today,

479
00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:50,291
and no, thank you.

480
00:22:50,326 --> 00:22:53,327
- Next.
- No. No. There is no next.

481
00:22:53,363 --> 00:22:56,731
We are running out of time
and options and god jizz.

482
00:22:56,766 --> 00:22:58,866
Look, just imagine dicks, okay?

483
00:22:58,902 --> 00:23:00,579
With one dick, you're
just jerking yourself off,

484
00:23:00,603 --> 00:23:02,403
but with three dicks,
suddenly you've got

485
00:23:02,439 --> 00:23:03,971
six people having sex.

486
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,917
Which is more powerful?

487
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:10,211
I think your metaphor literally
doesn't make any fucking sense.

488
00:23:10,246 --> 00:23:11,345
It doesn't have to.

489
00:23:11,381 --> 00:23:12,725
It just distracted you long enough

490
00:23:12,749 --> 00:23:14,148
for Alice to power up the spell,

491
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:17,423
which is all the shield charm has to do.

492
00:23:18,888 --> 00:23:20,088
I see what you did there.

493
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,735
Struck a nerve, didn't I?

494
00:23:28,001 --> 00:23:29,497
Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.

495
00:23:29,532 --> 00:23:31,478
I fell asleep for a moment.

496
00:23:32,423 --> 00:23:34,743
You ever eat something still alive?

497
00:23:36,407 --> 00:23:37,829
Can't say that I have.

498
00:23:38,415 --> 00:23:40,079
Civilized species and all.

499
00:23:41,321 --> 00:23:42,938
You're missing out.

500
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,712
I recommend starting at the far end,

501
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:50,587
so you can enjoy the fear.

502
00:23:51,774 --> 00:23:53,243
It's chemical.

503
00:23:54,165 --> 00:23:57,142
You can taste it. The fear.

504
00:23:59,267 --> 00:24:02,009
Not to mention the look on
your face. It's priceless.

505
00:24:02,465 --> 00:24:03,465
So why don't you and I...

506
00:24:08,671 --> 00:24:10,271
Apologies for the tardiness.

507
00:24:10,306 --> 00:24:12,640
You wards are rather extensive.

508
00:24:32,462 --> 00:24:33,558
Are we ready?

509
00:24:41,304 --> 00:24:42,347
Hey.

510
00:24:47,758 --> 00:24:48,792
Yeah.

511
00:25:21,845 --> 00:25:23,698
He's fighting the net.

512
00:25:24,534 --> 00:25:26,323
Not sure how much
longer I can hold this.

513
00:25:26,348 --> 00:25:27,648
Jesus Christ, Julia,

514
00:25:27,684 --> 00:25:29,517
would you please just gut this guy?

515
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,933
With pleasure.

516
00:25:36,142 --> 00:25:37,608
No! No...

517
00:25:58,114 --> 00:25:59,114
Now!

518
00:26:02,011 --> 00:26:03,217
- Julia.
- Blow that bitch up!

519
00:26:03,253 --> 00:26:04,685
Let's go.

520
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,333
Move!

521
00:26:34,456 --> 00:26:35,456
No!

522
00:26:36,286 --> 00:26:38,119
I missed him! I missed him!

523
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,106
I missed him! I missed him!

524
00:26:41,131 --> 00:26:42,247
I had Reynard.

525
00:26:42,272 --> 00:26:43,349
He was right in front of me.

526
00:26:43,373 --> 00:26:45,589
Yeah, and then you
screwed up our plan again.

527
00:26:45,614 --> 00:26:46,825
She just grabbed me.

528
00:26:46,849 --> 00:26:48,282
No, you all don't understand.

529
00:26:48,317 --> 00:26:50,417
I had Reynard. I had The Beast.

530
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,794
Fuck this. We're out.

531
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,716
Get off me!

532
00:26:59,014 --> 00:27:00,713
Where are we? Where did you take me?

533
00:27:00,872 --> 00:27:02,083
Subway's that way.

534
00:27:02,176 --> 00:27:03,516
Good luck with your bullshit.

535
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,880
Hey. Take me back.

536
00:27:05,287 --> 00:27:06,486
I need him.

537
00:27:06,898 --> 00:27:08,254
I need The Beast to kill Reynard.

538
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:09,355
Reynard has the knife.

539
00:27:09,391 --> 00:27:10,701
I can't do it without The Beast.

540
00:27:10,726 --> 00:27:11,812
It's not my problem.

541
00:27:13,261 --> 00:27:14,227
Oh, shit.

542
00:27:14,262 --> 00:27:15,395
Duck!

543
00:27:18,352 --> 00:27:20,460
- Shit...
- What the hell?

544
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:23,053
The chain was the only thing
keeping my hand from fucking...

545
00:27:23,077 --> 00:27:24,445
- Put it back on.
- I can't!

546
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,178
It's a ritual, and I don't have any...

547
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:27,911
Oh, no.

548
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:28,946
Get...

549
00:27:30,813 --> 00:27:31,779
Thank you.

550
00:27:31,814 --> 00:27:33,147
Yeah. No problem.

551
00:27:36,553 --> 00:27:38,531
- You fucking...
- Sorry.

552
00:27:38,835 --> 00:27:40,601
- Not my problem.
- Fuck.

553
00:27:49,031 --> 00:27:50,664
He's injured. Where else would he be?

554
00:27:50,699 --> 00:27:51,984
He has to be at the Wellspring.

555
00:27:52,009 --> 00:27:53,745
The Royal Carriage can
get there in under an hour.

556
00:27:53,769 --> 00:27:55,169
Okay, but if he can just blip in...

557
00:27:55,204 --> 00:27:56,870
Well, hopefully, his accuracy isn't

558
00:27:56,906 --> 00:27:59,006
at its best right now.
I know mine wouldn't be.

559
00:27:59,041 --> 00:28:01,175
Well, if those horses get
us there before The Beast,

560
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,509
I'll gladly fuck them both.

561
00:28:02,545 --> 00:28:05,005
Hey. Shh. Careful. Volume.

562
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,942
I think those are talking horses.

563
00:28:07,341 --> 00:28:08,682
Offer stands.

564
00:28:10,719 --> 00:28:12,341
Hey, can you still do this?

565
00:28:13,013 --> 00:28:14,302
I don't know.

566
00:28:14,497 --> 00:28:16,216
What choice do we have?

567
00:28:17,044 --> 00:28:18,721
Okay, we should send
El and Margo for help.

568
00:28:18,745 --> 00:28:21,060
Wait, you don't want us on
the suicide mission with you?

569
00:28:21,091 --> 00:28:22,347
Ember's temple is nearby,

570
00:28:22,382 --> 00:28:26,011
so just go and petition him for a re-up.

571
00:28:26,089 --> 00:28:27,167
Just in case Alice and I...

572
00:28:27,191 --> 00:28:28,667
Fail? Die?

573
00:28:30,128 --> 00:28:31,223
Sorry. Reflex.

574
00:28:31,258 --> 00:28:32,791
Okay. Fine. We'll go.

575
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:49,167
Hey. Thought exercise.

576
00:28:51,636 --> 00:28:56,323
Say we kill The Beast. Ahh... what then?

577
00:28:58,261 --> 00:28:59,542
Quentin, I don't know.

578
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,019
It's just... it's a distraction.

579
00:29:02,522 --> 00:29:03,761
Come on.

580
00:29:07,464 --> 00:29:09,105
Um...

581
00:29:11,019 --> 00:29:12,409
I would...

582
00:29:15,144 --> 00:29:17,167
I'd eat an ice cream sundae.

583
00:29:18,752 --> 00:29:20,308
With whipped cream and...

584
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:23,275
those fake rainbow-colored sprinkles

585
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:26,089
and... gummy bears on top.

586
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:29,748
I'm probably gonna try and win you back.

587
00:29:29,783 --> 00:29:31,214
Jesus, Quentin.

588
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,088
I'm sorry. That just sort
of flew out of my mouth.

589
00:29:33,112 --> 00:29:35,186
You know, I'm not a prize.

590
00:29:35,401 --> 00:29:36,988
I know that, but you know what I mean.

591
00:29:37,024 --> 00:29:39,581
No, and you didn't
just lose me like keys.

592
00:29:39,745 --> 00:29:42,128
I know, which is why I feel like I need

593
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,763
to earn back your trust.

594
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:46,347
This isn't fair.

595
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,347
You can't trap me in here.

596
00:29:50,058 --> 00:29:51,514
You can't trap me in here and expect me

597
00:29:51,538 --> 00:29:53,189
to deal with all this
heavy emotional shit

598
00:29:53,214 --> 00:29:54,606
when all I can handle right now...

599
00:29:54,641 --> 00:29:57,353
all I can handle right now is a
goddamn ice cream sundae, okay?

600
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:58,343
It's not a trap.

601
00:29:58,378 --> 00:29:59,811
Yes, it is, and why does it sound

602
00:29:59,846 --> 00:30:01,080
like you're trying to fight with me?

603
00:30:01,104 --> 00:30:03,180
Look. You've changed. Okay.

604
00:30:03,821 --> 00:30:07,319
You are not the girl that
I met a million years ago.

605
00:30:07,354 --> 00:30:09,157
You are amazing.

606
00:30:10,133 --> 00:30:12,657
And not that you weren't
amazing before, but...

607
00:30:13,751 --> 00:30:15,460
Quentin, where are you going with this?

608
00:30:15,852 --> 00:30:17,133
You've grown.

609
00:30:18,048 --> 00:30:21,566
And you're still growing,
and my point is that I am too.

610
00:30:21,868 --> 00:30:23,663
Are you saying you're
"not that guy anymore"?

611
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:26,271
No, I'm saying that I'm not<i>
just</i> that guy anymore,

612
00:30:26,306 --> 00:30:29,218
and I think that you...
I hope that you give me

613
00:30:29,243 --> 00:30:33,555
the opportunity to be better
and actually deserve you.

614
00:30:33,954 --> 00:30:36,414
And I know that that
sounds stupid, but I just...

615
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:39,050
I feel like we could
die in, like, an hour,

616
00:30:39,086 --> 00:30:42,235
and it's giving me a
lot of clarity right now.

617
00:30:44,493 --> 00:30:45,924
I don't know what to say, Quentin.

618
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:47,392
Also, I'm gonna make you

619
00:30:47,427 --> 00:30:50,161
the best ice cream
sundae you've ever had.

620
00:30:50,197 --> 00:30:51,896
You're gonna forget Popper 1,

621
00:30:51,932 --> 00:30:55,071
and I'm even gonna
put gummy bears on it,

622
00:30:55,282 --> 00:30:56,412
even though you don't understand

623
00:30:56,436 --> 00:30:58,563
how absolutely disgusting that is.

624
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:02,954
Quentin.

625
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,784
I'm sorry. I just was in the moment.

626
00:31:12,819 --> 00:31:14,673
Do you still want to fight?

627
00:31:15,789 --> 00:31:16,899
No.

628
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:24,798
Ember!

629
00:31:25,657 --> 00:31:27,008
Come out!

630
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:28,827
Hello?

631
00:31:28,852 --> 00:31:30,201
I'm pretty sure Q said

632
00:31:30,237 --> 00:31:32,226
the whole blood-stone
thing works right away.

633
00:31:32,251 --> 00:31:33,571
Fine. Give me your hand.

634
00:31:35,575 --> 00:31:36,674
Just...

635
00:31:38,485 --> 00:31:40,165
Oh, come on.

636
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,819
Ow. That kind of stings.

637
00:31:43,844 --> 00:31:44,962
Poor baby.

638
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:47,844
Great.

639
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:51,844
Well, now we're both bleeding.

640
00:31:52,204 --> 00:31:53,821
Maybe Ember isn't home.

641
00:31:54,305 --> 00:31:56,060
He's a god-in-exile.

642
00:31:56,096 --> 00:31:58,430
- <i>Where else could he be?
- I don't know.</i>

643
00:32:03,305 --> 00:32:04,446
Oh, God.

644
00:32:10,758 --> 00:32:12,410
Ah!

645
00:32:12,524 --> 00:32:17,610
Greetings, oh, powerful
and glorious Martin Chatwin.

646
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:21,419
My goodness. Only half
the man I remember.

647
00:32:21,587 --> 00:32:23,588
You know what happens
if you stay in Fillory.

648
00:32:23,623 --> 00:32:25,356
I know, I know. I'm leaving.

649
00:32:25,392 --> 00:32:28,821
I'm going. I just had
one or two things to do.

650
00:32:29,305 --> 00:32:30,673
Mainly number two.

651
00:32:32,032 --> 00:32:36,087
I have befouled the Wellspring.

652
00:32:36,751 --> 00:32:37,837
Pardon me?

653
00:32:37,862 --> 00:32:40,008
I have left my divine elimination

654
00:32:40,033 --> 00:32:41,391
in the font of all magic.

655
00:32:41,416 --> 00:32:42,423
And it's a stinker.

656
00:32:42,448 --> 00:32:44,431
I really hope you weren't
planning to drink from it.

657
00:32:44,455 --> 00:32:47,743
- It's hardly potable.
- You... what?

658
00:32:48,313 --> 00:32:53,579
Left my leavings... a
godly floater... behind.

659
00:32:54,826 --> 00:32:56,593
In the Wellspring.

660
00:32:59,118 --> 00:33:00,351
I pooped in it.

661
00:33:00,386 --> 00:33:01,969
Am I not making this very clear?

662
00:33:02,415 --> 00:33:03,930
You wretched bastard.

663
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:05,844
I know your true game.

664
00:33:05,977 --> 00:33:10,594
I know exactly every twist,
you... you stinking man-sheep!

665
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,229
Oh, my heavens. Look at the time.

666
00:33:12,265 --> 00:33:13,998
I really should be going,

667
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:17,535
although technically, I already went.

668
00:33:18,969 --> 00:33:21,079
I never tire of these jokes. Ta!

669
00:33:23,813 --> 00:33:26,126
Oh! Oh!

670
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,242
Oh!

671
00:33:32,915 --> 00:33:35,050
You stinking man-sheep!

672
00:33:35,085 --> 00:33:36,618
You're no god!

673
00:33:37,254 --> 00:33:40,766
You're no god! You're a farm animal!

674
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,727
Ember actually took a
shit in the Wellspring?

675
00:33:43,752 --> 00:33:44,969
<i>You're a farm animal!</i>

676
00:33:44,994 --> 00:33:46,844
Well, that can't be good for Fillory.

677
00:33:52,907 --> 00:33:55,188
Quentin Coldwater!

678
00:33:55,454 --> 00:33:56,576
Shit.

679
00:33:56,611 --> 00:33:59,313
Why don't you and Alice come join me?

680
00:34:04,219 --> 00:34:05,418
Mm.

681
00:34:05,453 --> 00:34:07,053
You're weaker.

682
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:08,921
And you're down six fingers.

683
00:34:10,091 --> 00:34:11,624
More than enough to kill you both.

684
00:34:13,428 --> 00:34:16,462
Hard to cast when you're sliced in two.

685
00:34:22,403 --> 00:34:24,055
Quentin!

686
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,606
You're a tough piece
of meat, aren't you?

687
00:34:26,641 --> 00:34:27,874
No matter.

688
00:34:37,452 --> 00:34:38,573
Aah!

689
00:34:39,362 --> 00:34:40,518
Ahh!

690
00:34:48,713 --> 00:34:50,338
I guess we're gonna die.

691
00:34:51,065 --> 00:34:53,099
To our pretty corpses.

692
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:56,569
Children of Earth! I have returned.

693
00:34:56,604 --> 00:35:00,706
Spank my cheeks. You're both royalty.

694
00:35:00,778 --> 00:35:02,298
How delightful.

695
00:35:02,677 --> 00:35:05,081
You have come here to beseech me?

696
00:35:05,862 --> 00:35:07,885
Well, yes.

697
00:35:08,449 --> 00:35:12,551
We have come to beseech your uhm... aid.

698
00:35:12,587 --> 00:35:15,198
Of course! You shall have it.

699
00:35:15,549 --> 00:35:18,257
Oh. Oh, but then
you're going to miss it.

700
00:35:18,293 --> 00:35:20,059
- Miss what?
- All the action.

701
00:35:20,094 --> 00:35:21,627
Between you and me,

702
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:23,963
I think Alice should make
this a very good show.

703
00:35:24,017 --> 00:35:25,423
No promises, though.

704
00:35:25,495 --> 00:35:26,766
Cheerio! Happy ruling!

705
00:35:26,801 --> 00:35:28,424
- No...
- Ember, we...

706
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:32,087
Great. Kicked us out before
we could even ask for the jizz.

707
00:35:32,112 --> 00:35:33,112
Margo, look.

708
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:35,641
Is that all you got?

709
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:43,823
You're not even a real
magician, are you, Martin?

710
00:35:43,848 --> 00:35:46,463
You're just a scared little boy.

711
00:35:47,055 --> 00:35:49,440
You wouldn't last an hour at Brakebills.

712
00:36:02,315 --> 00:36:03,436
Ahh!

713
00:36:03,604 --> 00:36:04,706
Jesus.

714
00:36:05,139 --> 00:36:06,939
Alice is going full "Harry Potter"

715
00:36:06,975 --> 00:36:08,774
part seven/eight over there.

716
00:36:08,962 --> 00:36:10,749
Oh, God. I hope we're winning.

717
00:36:15,533 --> 00:36:16,932
Damn it.

718
00:36:26,432 --> 00:36:27,665
Alice, what are you doing?

719
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,604
No. Alice, don't. Stop, it'll...

720
00:36:31,629 --> 00:36:32,895
What is she doing?

721
00:36:33,273 --> 00:36:34,505
She can't. She'll Niffin out.

722
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:35,973
This is not good, Alice.

723
00:36:39,024 --> 00:36:40,290
Alice, stop!

724
00:36:40,333 --> 00:36:41,526
It's okay.

725
00:36:42,295 --> 00:36:43,955
I've got this, Quentin.

726
00:36:47,018 --> 00:36:48,251
Alice, no!

727
00:36:57,729 --> 00:36:58,729
Alice!

728
00:37:02,588 --> 00:37:03,887
No!

729
00:37:12,635 --> 00:37:13,916
Oops.

730
00:37:14,455 --> 00:37:15,678
Too far.

731
00:37:17,427 --> 00:37:18,759
Too bad.

732
00:37:20,932 --> 00:37:23,947
Let's finally finish this.

733
00:37:33,474 --> 00:37:35,006
I did it on purpose.

734
00:37:37,502 --> 00:37:38,760
Move.

735
00:37:40,456 --> 00:37:41,947
- Let's go.
- We have to go.

736
00:37:41,972 --> 00:37:43,447
Go on.

737
00:37:44,331 --> 00:37:46,166
Something you want to say?

738
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:48,596
Alice.

739
00:37:49,202 --> 00:37:50,729
We can make a deal.

740
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:53,002
Think of the fun we could have together.

741
00:37:53,697 --> 00:37:54,846
You don't have to...

742
00:37:54,871 --> 00:37:55,937
But I want to.

743
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,440
Disappointing.

744
00:38:23,054 --> 00:38:24,486
Your turn.

745
00:38:33,379 --> 00:38:34,801
Alice!

746
00:38:39,253 --> 00:38:41,097
You got her attention. Now what?

747
00:38:43,215 --> 00:38:46,308
I'm sorry for all the times
I was a total dick to you.

748
00:38:46,468 --> 00:38:48,746
You're talking like you
mean something to me.

749
00:38:48,894 --> 00:38:50,511
Okay. Just...

750
00:38:52,415 --> 00:38:54,048
Alice. Don't.

751
00:39:01,082 --> 00:39:02,613
Go back.

752
00:39:02,638 --> 00:39:04,207
Quentin says go free.

753
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:21,004
Fuck.

754
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,137
Fuck.

755
00:39:51,035 --> 00:39:52,972
Alice.

756
00:39:53,931 --> 00:39:55,152
Alice.

757
00:40:03,647 --> 00:40:05,715
Alice. Hey. Hey.

758
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:11,832
Q, stop. You're hurt.

759
00:40:12,613 --> 00:40:14,566
Alice. Hey.

760
00:40:15,386 --> 00:40:16,519
You have to stop.

761
00:40:16,544 --> 00:40:18,079
Come on. She might be alive.

762
00:40:18,104 --> 00:40:19,383
- Just stop.
- She might be alive.

763
00:40:19,407 --> 00:40:20,660
You have to stop.

764
00:40:20,865 --> 00:40:23,426
Q, you have to stop.

765
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,769
You have to stop.

766
00:40:27,587 --> 00:40:28,824
You have to stop.
