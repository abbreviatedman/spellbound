1
00:00:01,108 --> 00:00:02,908
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:05,256 --> 00:00:07,201
Zillion bucks says The
Beast comes back any minute,

3
00:00:07,225 --> 00:00:08,357
so what's the plan?

4
00:00:08,392 --> 00:00:09,525
Okay, so here's the thing.

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,926
I can't really touch the knife.

6
00:00:10,962 --> 00:00:12,328
We need the power of a god.

7
00:00:12,363 --> 00:00:15,564
I have gifted you my
Bestowal. Imbibe it.

8
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:18,067
The more it burns,
the less time we have.

9
00:00:18,102 --> 00:00:19,835
There's a spell that
seems strong enough.

10
00:00:19,871 --> 00:00:21,070
These are my students.

11
00:00:21,105 --> 00:00:22,838
They are in need of the Rhinemann Ultra.

12
00:00:22,874 --> 00:00:26,509
No one but you can be
within 20 feet of the blast.

13
00:00:26,544 --> 00:00:28,577
Alice is going to take
just a few minutes

14
00:00:28,613 --> 00:00:29,745
to fully power up.

15
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,413
This is a cacodemon.

16
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:32,449
It'll grow much bigger.

17
00:00:32,483 --> 00:00:33,916
Unleash these, and believe me,

18
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:35,818
they'll keep The Beast plenty busy.

19
00:00:37,154 --> 00:00:39,421
- Do you know what a Niffin is?
- No.

20
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:42,191
It's when too much runs through you.

21
00:00:42,226 --> 00:00:44,360
Only the magic is left.

22
00:00:44,395 --> 00:00:46,562
Please... fix...

23
00:00:46,597 --> 00:00:47,696
my hands.

24
00:00:47,732 --> 00:00:50,032
Go... fuck... yourself?

25
00:00:50,067 --> 00:00:51,367
I think I can help.

26
00:00:51,402 --> 00:00:53,636
- Wow.
- I owe you for real.

27
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:55,549
You could die if you don't
get clear of The Beast.

28
00:00:55,573 --> 00:00:57,373
You think I don't know
how dangerous he is?

29
00:00:57,408 --> 00:00:59,141
No. Not him. Us.

30
00:00:59,176 --> 00:01:00,643
Yeah, do what you want with him,

31
00:01:00,678 --> 00:01:01,788
but not until I get Reynard.

32
00:01:01,812 --> 00:01:03,078
We can't merely summon him.

33
00:01:03,114 --> 00:01:04,914
A god can resist.

34
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:06,649
I don't give a shit about getting him.

35
00:01:06,684 --> 00:01:08,484
- You should.
- I didn't summon him.

36
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:10,219
I didn't get raped by him.

37
00:01:10,254 --> 00:01:11,287
I have no skin in this.

38
00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:12,821
Reynard is targeting hedges.

39
00:01:16,193 --> 00:01:18,427
Did you put some kind
of curse on the castle?

40
00:01:18,462 --> 00:01:19,662
Did I?

41
00:01:20,965 --> 00:01:22,932
The spell that won World War II

42
00:01:22,967 --> 00:01:25,067
is called the Rhinemann Ultra?

43
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:26,835
Sounds like a not-so-great beer.

44
00:01:26,871 --> 00:01:28,749
Fine, it's a beer, but
it's a beer that we can use

45
00:01:28,773 --> 00:01:30,617
- to kill The Beast.
- Meanwhile, Penny comes back

46
00:01:30,641 --> 00:01:32,775
with cool circa-1985 wrist chains.

47
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,756
Yeah, super cool how they
keep me from killing myself.

48
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,858
And then Dean Fogg gives you
all matching tramp stamps?

49
00:01:36,881 --> 00:01:38,247
I thought tramp stamps

50
00:01:38,282 --> 00:01:39,949
were supposed to be on our lower back?

51
00:01:39,984 --> 00:01:41,862
God, I feel like I missed
out on some crazy party

52
00:01:41,886 --> 00:01:43,864
you'll be talking about
for the rest of your lives.

53
00:01:43,888 --> 00:01:46,355
Say what you want, but we
brought back weapons and a plan.

54
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,290
What do you have to show for yourself?

55
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:57,333
Ta... fucking... da.

56
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:00,703
Your royal accoutrement.

57
00:02:00,738 --> 00:02:03,639
This is ceremony, people,

58
00:02:03,674 --> 00:02:06,942
and I expect you to
slather yourselves in it.

59
00:02:06,978 --> 00:02:07,943
Thank you, Eliot.

60
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:10,613
I missed you all.

61
00:02:10,648 --> 00:02:12,014
And I was bored.

62
00:02:12,494 --> 00:02:13,849
Come. Sit.

63
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,851
Wait, is this really
the most important thing

64
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,219
we could be doing right now?

65
00:02:17,254 --> 00:02:20,205
I mean, The Beast is still out there
waiting for us...

66
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,760
The Beast can wait for five minutes.

67
00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:24,526
You are all Kings and Queens of Fillory.

68
00:02:24,713 --> 00:02:26,328
Well, almost all of you.

69
00:02:26,455 --> 00:02:30,899
Just revel in your majesty
for one fucking second.

70
00:02:31,275 --> 00:02:33,385
Be regal, miscreants.

71
00:02:37,369 --> 00:02:38,440
Mm.

72
00:02:39,947 --> 00:02:42,144
You're such a stupid, stupid, man.

73
00:02:42,179 --> 00:02:43,712
I'm gonna kill you in your sleep.

74
00:02:46,183 --> 00:02:48,751
El... El... El, you okay?

75
00:02:48,786 --> 00:02:50,853
Totally fine, why?

76
00:02:50,888 --> 00:02:51,987
It's just...

77
00:02:52,023 --> 00:02:53,266
you went away there for a minute.

78
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,491
Nonsense. I feel great.

79
00:02:55,962 --> 00:02:57,092
Have a seat.

80
00:02:57,399 --> 00:02:59,395
I'm kind of on a clock here,

81
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,330
so we should talk strategy.

82
00:03:01,365 --> 00:03:02,409
Yeah, we already talked strategy,

83
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:03,766
so we just need to catch you up.

84
00:03:03,801 --> 00:03:04,878
You've been planning without me?

85
00:03:04,902 --> 00:03:06,435
Yeah... when we were on Earth.

86
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,782
What did you think we were doing?

87
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:14,921
Eliot, we're not trying to exclude you.

88
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,612
You just weren't there.

89
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:19,109
No. No, I wasn't, was I?

90
00:03:20,251 --> 00:03:22,284
Don't think I don't see how this works.

91
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,312
You disappear. You come back.

92
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:27,523
Matching tattoos, and now
you're three against one.

93
00:03:27,558 --> 00:03:29,558
I know exactly what you're planning.

94
00:03:29,593 --> 00:03:31,615
- Don't touch me.
- Sweetie?

95
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:34,363
You kind of sound insane.

96
00:03:34,398 --> 00:03:35,584
Do I?

97
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:42,037
Because I promise you...
I will not go down easily.

98
00:03:42,073 --> 00:03:43,670
Oo-surpers.

99
00:03:45,936 --> 00:03:48,277
Usurpers.

100
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:50,913
Whichever way you're
supposed to pronounce it.

101
00:03:50,948 --> 00:03:52,147
What just happened?

102
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:54,639
He got like this on shrooms once.

103
00:03:55,038 --> 00:03:56,785
I'll go talk to him.

104
00:04:03,788 --> 00:04:05,728
I just remembered
something that Julia said,

105
00:04:05,763 --> 00:04:07,301
and it's starting to
make a lot of sense.

106
00:04:07,325 --> 00:04:08,997
- You talked to that bitch?
- Yes, he did.

107
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:11,233
It was a warning.
Something The Beast said.

108
00:04:11,268 --> 00:04:14,269
Uh... God, of course. It makes sense.

109
00:04:14,305 --> 00:04:16,180
I mean, he'd want to
booby-trap his kingdom, right?

110
00:04:16,204 --> 00:04:20,109
So apparently, he left curses behind.

111
00:04:20,563 --> 00:04:22,311
Here, actually.

112
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:24,513
So you think Eliot might be cursed?

113
00:04:24,548 --> 00:04:26,315
I mean, she was vague, but I mean...

114
00:04:28,555 --> 00:04:29,618
Did either of you notice

115
00:04:29,653 --> 00:04:31,487
that Eliot started acting strangely

116
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:33,813
once he took a drink from the goblet?

117
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:38,894
I mean, it could be poison or a potion.

118
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:44,633
All right, well, we probably shouldn't
drink from ours just to be safe.

119
00:04:44,668 --> 00:04:45,879
Or maybe it was just some primo

120
00:04:45,903 --> 00:04:47,347
Fillorian shit that went up his nose,

121
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:49,063
and he's on the bad end of a trip

122
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:50,727
because he's him.

123
00:04:53,149 --> 00:04:54,376
Did something happen to you?

124
00:04:54,411 --> 00:04:56,211
Nope. Nothing.

125
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,766
I'm fine... Penny.

126
00:05:04,524 --> 00:05:07,189
Wait. And now you're doing it.

127
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:08,614
I don't know what you're talking about.

128
00:05:08,638 --> 00:05:09,892
I mean like Eliot.

129
00:05:09,927 --> 00:05:11,506
You're acting all tweaky and shit.

130
00:05:11,538 --> 00:05:12,944
We're fine.

131
00:05:13,725 --> 00:05:14,863
Clearly.

132
00:05:15,194 --> 00:05:17,975
Look, I think we can all agree
that we have a problem here.

133
00:05:18,358 --> 00:05:19,452
Eliot.

134
00:05:20,249 --> 00:05:23,505
He's High King. He's cursed.

135
00:05:23,635 --> 00:05:26,742
- We have no choice but...
- We have to kill him.

136
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:28,310
Exactly.

137
00:05:28,838 --> 00:05:30,073
The thrones.

138
00:05:31,245 --> 00:05:32,667
They're both cursed.

139
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:35,818
This is hard for you. I get that.

140
00:05:35,853 --> 00:05:37,319
It's hard for us too.

141
00:05:37,354 --> 00:05:38,735
But it must be done.

142
00:05:40,516 --> 00:05:42,110
For Fillory.

143
00:05:49,632 --> 00:05:51,266
But don't tell Quentin...

144
00:05:51,406 --> 00:05:53,335
I'm going to have to kill him too.

145
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:55,047
Right after Margo.

146
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:06,422
Margo?

147
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,578
Margo.

148
00:06:08,851 --> 00:06:11,687
Margo. Margo. Margo.
We got a serious problem, okay?

149
00:06:11,945 --> 00:06:13,388
I know. Eliot's cursed.

150
00:06:13,424 --> 00:06:15,424
No, no. Not just Eliot.
Alice and Quentin too.

151
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:18,293
Listen, whatever you do, do
not sit on your throne, okay?

152
00:06:18,329 --> 00:06:21,296
Fine. Whatevs. I have a plan.

153
00:06:21,665 --> 00:06:23,031
You gonna help me pick these?

154
00:06:23,067 --> 00:06:24,233
What's this? An antidote?

155
00:06:24,268 --> 00:06:25,701
Exactly. For the poison.

156
00:06:25,736 --> 00:06:27,046
For the... what?

157
00:06:28,163 --> 00:06:29,648
For the poison.

158
00:06:29,882 --> 00:06:32,929
I have to drink it first, or
I won't get Eliot to take it.

159
00:06:34,405 --> 00:06:38,113
Jesus. You're acting like
this is your first regicide.

160
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,549
Also, it's not the
thrones that are cursed.

161
00:06:40,584 --> 00:06:42,882
I sat on mine, and I'm totally fine.

162
00:06:43,179 --> 00:06:44,390
You sat on your...

163
00:06:45,122 --> 00:06:46,321
Fuck...

164
00:06:46,357 --> 00:06:47,749
Great. No, it's good.

165
00:06:47,858 --> 00:06:49,458
- Okay.
- Stop.

166
00:06:49,718 --> 00:06:50,818
This'll be over soon.

167
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:53,862
I'll deal with Eliot and Alice and Q.

168
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:55,710
You're welcome.

169
00:06:59,347 --> 00:07:00,663
Shit.

00:07:19,858 --> 00:07:23,091
So, this is our little fox trap, huh?

172
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:24,366
Yeah.

173
00:07:25,023 --> 00:07:27,577
So, you want to tell me
where you hooked up with your partner?

174
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:28,964
The Dirty Dozen?

175
00:07:30,499 --> 00:07:33,038
Ah. Fillory.

176
00:07:35,327 --> 00:07:36,972
Fine. Don't tell me.

177
00:07:39,515 --> 00:07:41,794
Listen, I'm here. I want to help.

178
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:44,163
But that asshole seems
like severe psychic damage.

179
00:07:44,188 --> 00:07:45,749
Look, I get it, okay?

180
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,816
But he knows a spell to freeze a god.

181
00:07:47,851 --> 00:07:50,101
I mean, you can't find that
at your local safe house.

182
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,322
Look, I have survived
this long on my instincts,

183
00:07:53,357 --> 00:07:55,223
and every one of them is telling me

184
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:56,623
that he is bad news.

185
00:07:56,648 --> 00:07:57,559
He's gonna turn on me.

186
00:07:57,594 --> 00:07:59,828
Or you. Or both of us.

187
00:07:59,863 --> 00:08:02,230
He can't, okay? We have an agreement.

188
00:08:02,346 --> 00:08:03,430
Word as bond.

189
00:08:03,455 --> 00:08:04,955
Those are tough to break.

190
00:08:05,557 --> 00:08:08,260
But if anyone could, it's someone
who could freeze a god.

191
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:12,619
Are you girls discussing
the nature of our agreement?

192
00:08:13,072 --> 00:08:14,133
Marina was just asking.

193
00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:15,346
Straightforward.

194
00:08:15,393 --> 00:08:17,546
I betray her, she cuts me to the quick.

195
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:19,548
So, tell me, what
happens after the tenets

196
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,216
of the agreement are met?

197
00:08:21,368 --> 00:08:23,579
Why worry? You'll be long gone by then.

198
00:08:23,806 --> 00:08:26,392
So, tell me. Are we ready?

199
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:28,798
Yeah.

200
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:32,661
♪ A-hunting we will go,
a-hunting we will go ♪

201
00:08:32,876 --> 00:08:34,441
♪ We'll catch a fox and
put him in a box ♪

202
00:08:34,465 --> 00:08:36,493
♪ And then we'll let him go ♪

203
00:08:37,993 --> 00:08:40,454
What? Those are the lyrics.

204
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,758
Benedict, right?

205
00:08:49,133 --> 00:08:50,212
I need your help.

206
00:08:52,049 --> 00:08:53,562
What do you do here again?

207
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:55,670
Royal mapmaker, sire.

208
00:08:55,695 --> 00:08:58,491
Is your problem
cartographical in nature?

209
00:08:58,516 --> 00:08:59,554
Not really.

210
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:02,691
What I need, Benedict, is a dagger.

211
00:09:02,823 --> 00:09:04,253
A stiletto, really.

212
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:07,753
Something I can sneak
up and stab someone with.

213
00:09:08,265 --> 00:09:09,431
But regal.

214
00:09:11,409 --> 00:09:13,003
I make maps, Your Majesty.

215
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:16,558
Well,... surely, someone has
snuck into your office

216
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:19,393
and dramatically stabbed a knife
into a map to make a point, no?

217
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,055
The other Kings and Queens who died...

218
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:24,846
we'd always just thought
it was just infighting.

219
00:09:24,882 --> 00:09:26,548
Greed and power.

220
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,450
Guess what? It's just
another horrible thing

221
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:32,621
The Beast was responsible
for, so how do we reverse this?

222
00:09:33,061 --> 00:09:34,654
Curses are tricky.

223
00:09:34,792 --> 00:09:36,326
You don't say.

224
00:09:37,701 --> 00:09:39,959
They usually end once
they've run their course.

225
00:09:40,272 --> 00:09:41,356
And not before.

226
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:42,568
That doesn't help us.

227
00:09:43,037 --> 00:09:45,557
This one seems to want to run its
course until they're all dead.

228
00:09:46,592 --> 00:09:48,951
Shit. Dead.

229
00:09:49,936 --> 00:09:51,045
- I have an idea.
- Okay.

230
00:09:51,311 --> 00:09:53,764
Do not let them kill each other, okay?

231
00:09:53,811 --> 00:09:54,753
Mm-hmm.

232
00:09:57,522 --> 00:09:59,084
I call on you.

233
00:09:59,342 --> 00:10:01,522
Our Lady Underground.

234
00:10:02,701 --> 00:10:05,326
As a child of the Earth...

235
00:10:06,342 --> 00:10:09,553
I seek you, O Mother.

236
00:10:10,248 --> 00:10:11,858
- Hey.
- Mm?

237
00:10:12,334 --> 00:10:15,654
Do me a favor and just believe it.

238
00:10:16,428 --> 00:10:18,266
A benevolent Mommy who
will solve my problems

239
00:10:18,302 --> 00:10:20,236
with her Gaia power?

240
00:10:21,322 --> 00:10:23,814
Yeah. Or Reynard won't show.

241
00:10:24,947 --> 00:10:27,283
You realize I don't even
own a pair of yoga pants.

242
00:10:29,213 --> 00:10:30,244
So act.

243
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:47,392
I seek to know you, Divine Mother.

244
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:51,306
Giver of life and light.

245
00:10:51,642 --> 00:10:53,802
I ask to gaze upon you.

246
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,744
To hear your voice.

247
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:58,373
To feel the beating heart of you.

248
00:10:58,603 --> 00:11:01,343
I beseech you. Hear me now.

249
00:11:04,275 --> 00:11:06,603
What happened? Where are we?

250
00:11:06,924 --> 00:11:08,744
A park. Few blocks away.

251
00:11:08,892 --> 00:11:11,653
Is this a joke? Take us back now.

252
00:11:11,688 --> 00:11:13,494
Well, we can't go back.

253
00:11:13,728 --> 00:11:15,690
Reynard's scented you before.

254
00:11:15,726 --> 00:11:17,759
If he smells you again, he won't show.

255
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,895
If you want him,

256
00:11:20,142 --> 00:11:22,408
you might just have to
risk losing your bait.

257
00:11:22,947 --> 00:11:25,066
I'm sorry. You're saying this now?

258
00:11:25,244 --> 00:11:28,570
Well, if I'd told you before,
would you have agreed to it?

259
00:11:29,236 --> 00:11:30,713
Fine. I'll walk.

260
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,447
Oh, excellent idea.

261
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:33,742
By the time we arrive,

262
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,944
he'll be so engrossed
in Marina's evisceration,

263
00:11:35,979 --> 00:11:38,180
he won't even realize we're there.

264
00:11:38,369 --> 00:11:39,674
You're good.

265
00:11:44,111 --> 00:11:47,355
I ask to gaze upon
you. To hear your voice.

266
00:11:47,391 --> 00:11:48,790
To feel the beating heart of you.

267
00:11:48,825 --> 00:11:52,060
I ask to gaze upon
you! To hear your voice!

268
00:11:52,118 --> 00:11:54,498
To feel the beating heart of you!

269
00:11:59,701 --> 00:12:01,670
Oh, you've got to be fucking kidding.

270
00:12:03,177 --> 00:12:04,306
Fuck this noise.

271
00:12:17,506 --> 00:12:18,587
What's so funny?

272
00:12:19,021 --> 00:12:20,732
You with a crossbow.

273
00:12:21,318 --> 00:12:24,342
You couldn't hit a fat girl
with a fat-girl-seeking arrow.

274
00:12:25,342 --> 00:12:26,926
Oh, don't give me that look.

275
00:12:26,974 --> 00:12:28,740
It's a figure of speech.

276
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,433
No way in hell I'll
miss you from this range.

277
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:35,437
Well, if you use that arrow
as good as you use your dick...

278
00:12:39,154 --> 00:12:40,662
You enchanted yourself, didn't you?

279
00:12:40,756 --> 00:12:41,810
I'm not an idiot.

280
00:12:43,756 --> 00:12:46,448
Margo says go free.

281
00:12:51,054 --> 00:12:52,271
Oh, fuck...

282
00:12:53,935 --> 00:12:55,348
Jesus Christ.

283
00:12:55,373 --> 00:12:56,691
Penny says go free.

284
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:09,604
Aah!

285
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,509
You just had to let him save you, huh?

286
00:13:14,974 --> 00:13:16,137
You're such a girl.

287
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:17,812
You know, I would like to see you dead

288
00:13:17,848 --> 00:13:19,348
regardless of your gender.

289
00:13:19,373 --> 00:13:20,990
Shut up. Both of you.

290
00:13:21,412 --> 00:13:23,184
I'm gonna take you someplace safe,

291
00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:24,364
but if I have to shoot
you to get you there,

292
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:25,826
I will make sure it hurts.

293
00:13:25,927 --> 00:13:27,489
Gee, thanks, but I'm enchanted.

294
00:13:28,552 --> 00:13:29,592
Aah!

295
00:13:30,006 --> 00:13:31,442
Your enchantment's weak.

296
00:13:31,467 --> 00:13:32,732
Aah!

297
00:13:33,154 --> 00:13:35,130
You shot me, you cock.

298
00:13:35,576 --> 00:13:38,380
Why didn't you shoot her in the neck?
The carotid is right there.

299
00:13:47,748 --> 00:13:49,060
Don't fret.

300
00:13:49,638 --> 00:13:51,270
If Reynard had killed Marina,

301
00:13:51,295 --> 00:13:54,771
don't you think there'd be lots of
little Marina bits lying around?

302
00:13:54,796 --> 00:13:56,037
She ran.

303
00:13:56,693 --> 00:13:58,810
I don't think she even
finished the spell.

304
00:13:59,787 --> 00:14:02,190
We're gonna have to
start this all over again,

305
00:14:02,225 --> 00:14:03,817
and now we've lost Marina.

306
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:05,271
I don't even know how
we're supposed to do...

307
00:14:05,295 --> 00:14:06,594
Don't be so hasty.

308
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,943
Are you absolutely sure it didn't work?

309
00:14:09,607 --> 00:14:10,832
If I were your fox god,

310
00:14:10,867 --> 00:14:14,287
I might just, say, follow her home

311
00:14:14,576 --> 00:14:16,506
rather than kill her on the spot.

312
00:14:21,373 --> 00:14:23,059
You knew this was going to happen.

313
00:14:23,084 --> 00:14:24,982
Why do you think I
took you out of there?

314
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,750
Chin up. If I'm right, our
little summoning worked.

315
00:14:29,099 --> 00:14:30,562
We just need to find foxy

316
00:14:30,587 --> 00:14:33,628
before he's finished with
his prey, n'est-ce pas?

317
00:14:56,456 --> 00:14:58,823
You just locked us
both inside, you know?

318
00:15:00,823 --> 00:15:02,378
You must be Marina.

319
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,404
Shit. Her wards are up.

320
00:15:13,436 --> 00:15:14,654
We can't get inside.

321
00:15:15,897 --> 00:15:17,006
Can you break them?

322
00:15:19,405 --> 00:15:21,365
Aha. Here.

323
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,592
That's one.

324
00:15:24,404 --> 00:15:27,990
Settle in. This may take a bit.

325
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:33,740
Bad news... you're cursed.

326
00:15:34,162 --> 00:15:36,811
Good news... I think there's a way out.

327
00:15:36,983 --> 00:15:38,584
Does it involve your beheading?

328
00:15:38,609 --> 00:15:40,304
'Cause that's the ending
I'm voting for right now.

329
00:15:40,328 --> 00:15:42,967
I second that. My ass still hurts.

330
00:15:42,992 --> 00:15:44,084
Enough!

331
00:15:44,381 --> 00:15:45,429
Listen.

332
00:15:45,465 --> 00:15:47,098
I can't stop the curse,

333
00:15:47,133 --> 00:15:49,811
so the plan is we're gonna
let it run its course.

334
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:52,069
By killing you. All of you.

335
00:15:52,105 --> 00:15:54,105
- No likey.
- What's to likey?

336
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,207
The part where you're
dead sounds perfect.

337
00:15:56,242 --> 00:15:57,381
Shut up.

338
00:15:58,444 --> 00:16:00,545
Now, I took a little
trip to get supplies.

339
00:16:01,981 --> 00:16:04,436
Oh, goody. Heroin.

340
00:16:05,225 --> 00:16:07,458
I always suspected this was how I'd go.

341
00:16:07,483 --> 00:16:10,498
Potassium chloride will
shut down the heart.

342
00:16:10,842 --> 00:16:13,139
Adrenaline will kick-start it.

343
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:17,061
You die. Curse ends. I revive you.

344
00:16:17,096 --> 00:16:20,097
Except what if any part
of that plan doesn't work?

345
00:16:20,133 --> 00:16:22,133
Look, asshole. You don't like my idea,

346
00:16:22,168 --> 00:16:23,479
why don't you go find someone else

347
00:16:23,503 --> 00:16:25,069
to save your annoying fucking life?

348
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:27,432
I have about a thousand better
things to do with my day.

349
00:16:30,943 --> 00:16:32,276
What the hell?

350
00:16:36,526 --> 00:16:38,002
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

351
00:16:38,042 --> 00:16:42,286
My fingers are a little numb
due to the anti-curse things.

352
00:16:42,321 --> 00:16:44,255
Well, that's just perfect.

353
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,901
It's fine.

354
00:16:45,956 --> 00:16:47,495
Uh, it's fine.

355
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,260
So, are we still hostages or what?

356
00:16:49,285 --> 00:16:50,846
Yes. Yes, you are.

357
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:53,308
Would you point that thing
at their fucking heads?

358
00:16:53,332 --> 00:16:54,732
Everyone please,

359
00:16:54,767 --> 00:16:56,524
please just stand in your corners

360
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:58,269
and just quietly...

361
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,596
- Dang it, Margo.
- Yeah, yeah. Whatever.

362
00:17:03,252 --> 00:17:04,479
You're dead.

363
00:17:12,451 --> 00:17:15,010
I suppose this is one way to
get the killing bit over with?

364
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,846
Yeah.

365
00:17:16,901 --> 00:17:18,549
This is what I was planning.

366
00:17:18,963 --> 00:17:23,104
The wards around this place
were deceptively advanced.

367
00:17:23,448 --> 00:17:26,057
I'm impressed. You have talent.

368
00:17:27,633 --> 00:17:29,333
I bet you say that to all the girls

369
00:17:29,368 --> 00:17:32,206
right before you rape them,
kill them, and eat their hearts.

370
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,174
You wear that cynicism so stylishly.

371
00:17:36,042 --> 00:17:37,737
It's too bad I know it's a lie.

372
00:17:37,977 --> 00:17:39,065
Is it?

373
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:42,471
No true cynic would call to the Goddess.

374
00:17:43,216 --> 00:17:45,932
That must hurt, to know
she wasn't listening.

375
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:48,815
On the plus side, I was.

376
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,721
Listen, I love the foreplay.

377
00:17:50,756 --> 00:17:52,523
It's hot. It really is.

378
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:54,354
But just get it over with and kill me...

379
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:58,062
All in good time.

380
00:18:00,284 --> 00:18:01,599
You know, it doesn't take Freud

381
00:18:01,634 --> 00:18:03,867
to see that a god who
likes to prey on chicks

382
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:07,385
is compensating for
a lack of... something.

383
00:18:08,749 --> 00:18:10,335
What even are you?

384
00:18:10,828 --> 00:18:12,601
God of Goat Herding?

385
00:18:13,054 --> 00:18:14,445
Grapes?

386
00:18:14,492 --> 00:18:15,906
Oh, wait. Is it Manure?

387
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,984
I bet you love coming here
and fucking with mortals

388
00:18:20,019 --> 00:18:22,507
'cause back home in
god-land, you barely rank.

389
00:18:23,124 --> 00:18:25,522
Watch your mouth, or I'll
slice out your tongue,

390
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:27,255
and I'll eat it in front of you.

391
00:18:28,372 --> 00:18:30,927
You're really not getting the
message that you don't scare me.

392
00:18:30,952 --> 00:18:33,474
Oh, I think I do scare you.

393
00:18:41,574 --> 00:18:45,497
So rare for someone to try to
summon Our Lady on their own.

394
00:18:46,479 --> 00:18:48,200
You're all alone, aren't you?

395
00:18:48,381 --> 00:18:50,919
There's... no else in your life.

396
00:18:51,317 --> 00:18:52,442
Seriously?

397
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:54,918
Trying to hurt my feelings?

398
00:18:54,954 --> 00:18:56,198
And the best you can come up with

399
00:18:56,222 --> 00:18:58,422
is "why couldn't you find a man?"

400
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,536
Is anyone really gonna miss you?

401
00:19:01,325 --> 00:19:03,005
I tip the pizza guy pretty well.

402
00:19:03,317 --> 00:19:04,317
Hmm

403
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:06,849
Ah...

404
00:19:09,168 --> 00:19:10,846
You're not totally alone.

405
00:19:11,877 --> 00:19:14,805
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

406
00:19:16,075 --> 00:19:17,213
Aww

407
00:19:18,026 --> 00:19:19,133
Cupcake?

408
00:19:20,346 --> 00:19:21,674
What a cutie she is.

409
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:26,049
You witches and your familiars.

410
00:19:26,852 --> 00:19:29,713
Hmm. You don't care for people,

411
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,627
but you do love her, don't you?

412
00:19:33,859 --> 00:19:35,112
Don't be stupid.

413
00:19:35,401 --> 00:19:37,761
She's just a dumb cat. Put her down.

414
00:19:37,797 --> 00:19:41,276
No. I'd like to pet her.

415
00:19:57,316 --> 00:19:59,678
Oh. Look at that.

416
00:19:59,772 --> 00:20:01,752
I think she might still be alive.

417
00:20:01,787 --> 00:20:03,311
That's funny.

418
00:20:04,951 --> 00:20:05,951
Uh-uh.

419
00:20:08,127 --> 00:20:09,127
No magic.

420
00:20:10,998 --> 00:20:12,116
Aah!

421
00:20:18,412 --> 00:20:19,412
See?

422
00:20:19,967 --> 00:20:21,803
So much more fun to be had.

423
00:20:22,508 --> 00:20:23,811
What's the rush?

424
00:20:38,631 --> 00:20:44,084
Ha! I won, bitches. I'm
High motherfucking Queen.

425
00:20:44,241 --> 00:20:46,163
Get the other needles. Hurry.

426
00:20:46,198 --> 00:20:47,831
Hey! Stay back.

427
00:20:47,867 --> 00:20:49,077
Margo, we don't have time for this.

428
00:20:49,101 --> 00:20:50,200
We got to revive 'em now.

429
00:20:50,236 --> 00:20:51,969
What's best in life, Penny?

430
00:20:52,004 --> 00:20:52,871
What?

431
00:20:52,896 --> 00:20:54,538
What's best in life?

432
00:20:54,738 --> 00:20:56,306
I don't know.

433
00:20:56,342 --> 00:20:59,476
To crush your enemies,
see them driven before you,

434
00:20:59,512 --> 00:21:02,212
and hear the lamentations
of their women.

435
00:21:03,481 --> 00:21:05,574
Come at me, farm girl.

436
00:21:11,098 --> 00:21:13,879
That's one thorough fucking curse.

437
00:21:13,996 --> 00:21:16,895
Is it wrong to say I find her
death extremely satisfying?

438
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,429
Okay, come on. I need your help.

439
00:21:24,389 --> 00:21:25,759
Oh, my God.

440
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,173
What the hell?

441
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:30,860
Welcome back. Loser.

442
00:21:32,913 --> 00:21:34,782
Do you want me to get that?

443
00:21:35,349 --> 00:21:36,571
Aah...

444
00:21:42,337 --> 00:21:43,462
It's time.

445
00:21:45,025 --> 00:21:47,665
Don't know how long I'll
have to cast the Rhinemann.

446
00:21:48,681 --> 00:21:51,196
Ugh. Eliot's right. It's a stupid name.

447
00:21:51,231 --> 00:21:52,993
And I wish I had a beer.

448
00:21:53,227 --> 00:21:54,571
That really doesn't look right.

449
00:21:54,685 --> 00:21:56,974
Does it require me playing Rachmaninoff?

450
00:21:57,204 --> 00:22:00,372
If not... we're fine.

451
00:22:00,407 --> 00:22:01,918
Look, you still got to grab The Beast.

452
00:22:01,942 --> 00:22:03,642
What happens if you
take the bracelets off?

453
00:22:03,677 --> 00:22:05,421
- That's a bad idea.
- Well, then, how are you...

454
00:22:05,445 --> 00:22:06,856
All I have to do is touch him, right?

455
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,079
So I'll tackle his ass, okay?

456
00:22:08,115 --> 00:22:11,638
Well, we are down two cacodemons.

457
00:22:12,052 --> 00:22:14,138
Any ideas how to slow up The Beast now?

458
00:22:14,263 --> 00:22:16,255
Actually, we only have one.

459
00:22:16,423 --> 00:22:17,522
I let mine go.

460
00:22:17,558 --> 00:22:19,708
Oh, Jesus. Come on.

461
00:22:19,794 --> 00:22:21,826
I could feel it. Alive and in my skin.

462
00:22:21,862 --> 00:22:23,940
I couldn't stand the idea
of it being trapped in there.

463
00:22:23,964 --> 00:22:25,931
- Shocking no one.
- Just leave her alone.

464
00:22:25,966 --> 00:22:27,999
It's not like you
have yours. I do, so...

465
00:22:28,035 --> 00:22:29,412
Because you were too much of a pussy

466
00:22:29,436 --> 00:22:30,368
to use it.

467
00:22:30,404 --> 00:22:31,591
I got this, Q.

468
00:22:32,826 --> 00:22:34,740
Okay. Idea.

469
00:22:34,951 --> 00:22:37,075
Do you guys remember
the Sumerian shield charm

470
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,209
we learned in PA?

471
00:22:38,677 --> 00:22:39,477
Like, to keep you safe

472
00:22:39,513 --> 00:22:41,079
from shattered glass or something?

473
00:22:41,216 --> 00:22:42,714
It's a simple spell,

474
00:22:42,749 --> 00:22:44,127
but that doesn't mean it's not powerful.

475
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:45,895
Especially if all three
of us are casting it.

476
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,887
Use a first-year spell
to stop The Beast?

477
00:22:48,943 --> 00:22:50,288
That sounds like suicide.

478
00:22:50,324 --> 00:22:51,923
Which I've already tried today,

479
00:22:51,959 --> 00:22:53,191
and no, thank you.

480
00:22:53,226 --> 00:22:56,227
- Next.
- No. No. There is no next.

481
00:22:56,263 --> 00:22:59,631
We are running out of time
and options and god jizz.

482
00:22:59,666 --> 00:23:01,766
Look, just imagine dicks, okay?

483
00:23:01,802 --> 00:23:03,479
With one dick, you're
just jerking yourself off,

484
00:23:03,503 --> 00:23:05,303
but with three dicks,
suddenly you've got

485
00:23:05,339 --> 00:23:06,871
six people having sex.

486
00:23:06,907 --> 00:23:08,817
Which is more powerful?

487
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:13,111
I think your metaphor literally
doesn't make any fucking sense.

488
00:23:13,146 --> 00:23:14,245
It doesn't have to.

489
00:23:14,281 --> 00:23:15,625
It just distracted you long enough

490
00:23:15,649 --> 00:23:17,048
for Alice to power up the spell,

491
00:23:17,084 --> 00:23:20,323
which is all the shield charm has to do.

492
00:23:21,788 --> 00:23:22,988
I see what you did there.

493
00:23:25,926 --> 00:23:27,635
Struck a nerve, didn't I?

494
00:23:30,901 --> 00:23:32,397
Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.

495
00:23:32,432 --> 00:23:34,378
I fell asleep for a moment.

496
00:23:35,323 --> 00:23:37,643
You ever eat something still alive?

497
00:23:39,307 --> 00:23:40,729
Can't say that I have.

498
00:23:41,315 --> 00:23:42,979
Civilized species and all.

499
00:23:44,221 --> 00:23:45,838
You're missing out.

500
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:50,612
I recommend starting at the far end,

501
00:23:51,495 --> 00:23:53,487
so you can enjoy the fear.

502
00:23:54,674 --> 00:23:56,143
It's chemical.

503
00:23:57,065 --> 00:24:00,042
You can taste it. The fear.

504
00:24:02,167 --> 00:24:04,909
Not to mention the look on
your face. It's priceless.

505
00:24:05,365 --> 00:24:06,331
So why don't you and I...

506
00:24:11,571 --> 00:24:13,171
Apologies for the tardiness.

507
00:24:13,206 --> 00:24:15,540
You wards are rather extensive.

508
00:24:35,362 --> 00:24:36,458
Are we ready?

509
00:24:44,204 --> 00:24:45,247
Hey.

510
00:24:50,658 --> 00:24:51,692
Yeah.

511
00:25:24,745 --> 00:25:26,598
He's fighting the net.

512
00:25:27,434 --> 00:25:29,223
Not sure how much
longer I can hold this.

513
00:25:29,248 --> 00:25:30,548
Jesus Christ, Julia,

514
00:25:30,584 --> 00:25:32,417
would you please just gut this guy?

515
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,833
With pleasure.

516
00:25:39,042 --> 00:25:40,508
No! No...

517
00:26:01,014 --> 00:26:02,014
Now!

518
00:26:04,911 --> 00:26:06,117
- Julia.
- Blow that bitch up!

519
00:26:06,153 --> 00:26:07,585
Let's go.

520
00:26:10,924 --> 00:26:12,233
Move!

521
00:26:37,356 --> 00:26:38,356
No!

522
00:26:39,186 --> 00:26:41,019
I missed him! I missed him!

523
00:26:42,737 --> 00:26:44,806
I missed him! I missed him!

524
00:26:44,831 --> 00:26:45,947
I had Reynard.

525
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:47,049
He was right in front of me.

526
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:49,289
Yeah, and then you
screwed up our plan again.

527
00:26:49,314 --> 00:26:50,525
She just grabbed me.

528
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:51,982
No, you all don't understand.

529
00:26:52,017 --> 00:26:54,117
I had Reynard. I had The Beast.

530
00:26:54,142 --> 00:26:55,494
Fuck this. We're out.

531
00:27:00,979 --> 00:27:02,416
Get off me!

532
00:27:02,714 --> 00:27:04,413
Where are we? Where did you take me?

533
00:27:04,572 --> 00:27:05,783
Subway's that way.

534
00:27:05,876 --> 00:27:07,216
Good luck with your bullshit.

535
00:27:07,252 --> 00:27:08,580
Hey. Take me back.

536
00:27:08,987 --> 00:27:10,186
I need him.

537
00:27:10,598 --> 00:27:11,954
I need The Beast to kill Reynard.

538
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:13,055
Reynard has the knife.

539
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:14,401
I can't do it without The Beast.

540
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:15,512
It's not my problem.

541
00:27:16,961 --> 00:27:17,927
Oh, shit.

542
00:27:17,962 --> 00:27:19,095
Duck!

543
00:27:22,052 --> 00:27:24,160
- Shit...
- What the hell?

544
00:27:24,341 --> 00:27:26,753
The chain was the only thing
keeping my hand from fucking...

545
00:27:26,777 --> 00:27:28,145
- Put it back on.
- I can't!

546
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,878
It's a ritual, and I don't have any...

547
00:27:30,645 --> 00:27:31,611
Oh, no.

548
00:27:31,646 --> 00:27:32,646
Get...

549
00:27:34,513 --> 00:27:35,479
Thank you.

550
00:27:35,514 --> 00:27:36,847
Yeah. No problem.

551
00:27:40,253 --> 00:27:42,231
- You fucking...
- Sorry.

552
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:44,301
- Not my problem.
- Fuck.

553
00:27:52,731 --> 00:27:54,364
He's injured. Where else would he be?

554
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:55,684
He has to be at the Wellspring.

555
00:27:55,709 --> 00:27:57,445
The Royal Carriage can
get there in under an hour.

556
00:27:57,469 --> 00:27:58,869
Okay, but if he can just blip in...

557
00:27:58,904 --> 00:28:00,570
Well, hopefully, his accuracy isn't

558
00:28:00,606 --> 00:28:02,706
at its best right now.
I know mine wouldn't be.

559
00:28:02,741 --> 00:28:04,875
Well, if those horses get
us there before The Beast,

560
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,209
I'll gladly fuck them both.

561
00:28:06,245 --> 00:28:08,705
Hey. Shh. Careful. Volume.

562
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,642
I think those are talking horses.

563
00:28:11,041 --> 00:28:12,382
Offer stands.

564
00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:16,041
Hey, can you still do this?

565
00:28:16,713 --> 00:28:18,002
I don't know.

566
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,916
What choice do we have?

567
00:28:20,744 --> 00:28:22,421
Okay, we should send
El and Margo for help.

568
00:28:22,445 --> 00:28:24,760
Wait, you don't want us on
the suicide mission with you?

569
00:28:24,791 --> 00:28:26,047
Ember's temple is nearby,

570
00:28:26,082 --> 00:28:29,711
so just go and petition him for a re-up.

571
00:28:29,789 --> 00:28:30,867
Just in case Alice and I...

572
00:28:30,891 --> 00:28:32,367
Fail? Die?

573
00:28:33,828 --> 00:28:34,923
Sorry. Reflex.

574
00:28:34,958 --> 00:28:36,491
Okay. Fine. We'll go.

575
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,867
Hey. Thought exercise.

576
00:28:55,336 --> 00:29:00,023
Say we kill The Beast. Ahh... what then?

577
00:29:01,961 --> 00:29:03,242
Quentin, I don't know.

578
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,719
It's just... it's a distraction.

579
00:29:06,222 --> 00:29:07,461
Come on.

580
00:29:11,164 --> 00:29:12,805
Um...

581
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:16,109
I would...

582
00:29:18,844 --> 00:29:20,867
I'd eat an ice cream sundae.

583
00:29:22,452 --> 00:29:24,008
With whipped cream and...

584
00:29:25,086 --> 00:29:26,975
those fake rainbow-colored sprinkles

585
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:29,789
and... gummy bears on top.

586
00:29:31,508 --> 00:29:33,448
I'm probably gonna try and win you back.

587
00:29:33,483 --> 00:29:34,914
Jesus, Quentin.

588
00:29:35,094 --> 00:29:36,788
I'm sorry. That just sort
of flew out of my mouth.

589
00:29:36,812 --> 00:29:38,886
You know, I'm not a prize.

590
00:29:39,101 --> 00:29:40,688
I know that, but you know what I mean.

591
00:29:40,724 --> 00:29:43,281
No, and you didn't
just lose me like keys.

592
00:29:43,445 --> 00:29:45,828
I know, which is why I feel like I need

593
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,463
to earn back your trust.

594
00:29:48,498 --> 00:29:50,047
This isn't fair.

595
00:29:51,219 --> 00:29:53,047
You can't trap me in here.

596
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:55,214
You can't trap me in here and expect me

597
00:29:55,238 --> 00:29:56,889
to deal with all this
heavy emotional shit

598
00:29:56,914 --> 00:29:58,306
when all I can handle right now...

599
00:29:58,341 --> 00:30:01,053
all I can handle right now is a
goddamn ice cream sundae, okay?

600
00:30:01,078 --> 00:30:02,043
It's not a trap.

601
00:30:02,078 --> 00:30:03,511
Yes, it is, and why does it sound

602
00:30:03,546 --> 00:30:04,780
like you're trying to fight with me?

603
00:30:04,804 --> 00:30:06,880
Look. You've changed. Okay.

604
00:30:07,521 --> 00:30:11,019
You are not the girl that
I met a million years ago.

605
00:30:11,054 --> 00:30:12,857
You are amazing.

606
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:16,357
And not that you weren't
amazing before, but...

607
00:30:17,451 --> 00:30:19,160
Quentin, where are you going with this?

608
00:30:19,552 --> 00:30:20,833
You've grown.

609
00:30:21,748 --> 00:30:25,266
And you're still growing,
and my point is that I am too.

610
00:30:25,568 --> 00:30:27,363
Are you saying you're
"not that guy anymore"?

611
00:30:27,388 --> 00:30:29,971
No, I'm saying that I'm not
just that guy anymore,

612
00:30:30,006 --> 00:30:32,918
and I think that you...
I hope that you give me

613
00:30:32,943 --> 00:30:37,255
the opportunity to be better
and actually deserve you.

614
00:30:37,654 --> 00:30:40,114
And I know that that
sounds stupid, but I just...

615
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:42,750
I feel like we could
die in, like, an hour,

616
00:30:42,786 --> 00:30:45,935
and it's giving me a
lot of clarity right now.

617
00:30:48,193 --> 00:30:49,624
I don't know what to say, Quentin.

618
00:30:49,659 --> 00:30:51,092
Also, I'm gonna make you

619
00:30:51,127 --> 00:30:53,861
the best ice cream
sundae you've ever had.

620
00:30:53,897 --> 00:30:55,596
You're gonna forget Popper 1,

621
00:30:55,632 --> 00:30:58,771
and I'm even gonna
put gummy bears on it,

622
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,112
even though you don't understand

623
00:31:00,136 --> 00:31:02,263
how absolutely disgusting that is.

624
00:31:05,575 --> 00:31:06,654
Quentin.

625
00:31:14,318 --> 00:31:16,484
I'm sorry. I just was in the moment.

626
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:18,373
Do you still want to fight?

627
00:31:19,489 --> 00:31:20,599
No.

628
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,498
Ember!

629
00:31:29,357 --> 00:31:30,708
Come out!

630
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:33,901
- Hello?
- I'm pretty sure Q said

631
00:31:33,937 --> 00:31:35,926
the whole blood-stone
thing works right away.

632
00:31:35,951 --> 00:31:37,271
Fine. Give me your hand.

633
00:31:39,275 --> 00:31:40,374
Just...

634
00:31:42,185 --> 00:31:43,865
Oh, come on.

635
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:47,519
Ow. That kind of stings.

636
00:31:47,544 --> 00:31:48,662
Poor baby.

637
00:31:50,521 --> 00:31:51,544
Great.

638
00:31:53,341 --> 00:31:55,544
Well, now we're both bleeding.

639
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:57,521
Maybe Ember isn't home.

640
00:31:58,005 --> 00:31:59,760
He's a god-in-exile.

641
00:31:59,796 --> 00:32:02,130
- Where else could he be?
- I don't know.

642
00:32:07,005 --> 00:32:08,146
Oh, God.

643
00:32:14,458 --> 00:32:16,110
Ah!

644
00:32:16,224 --> 00:32:21,310
Greetings, oh, powerful
and glorious Martin Chatwin.

645
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:25,119
My goodness. Only half
the man I remember.

646
00:32:25,287 --> 00:32:27,288
You know what happens
if you stay in Fillory.

647
00:32:27,323 --> 00:32:29,056
I know, I know. I'm leaving.

648
00:32:29,092 --> 00:32:32,521
I'm going. I just had
one or two things to do.

649
00:32:33,005 --> 00:32:34,373
Mainly number two.

650
00:32:35,732 --> 00:32:39,787
I have befouled the Wellspring.

651
00:32:40,451 --> 00:32:41,537
Pardon me?

652
00:32:41,562 --> 00:32:43,708
I have left my divine elimination

653
00:32:43,733 --> 00:32:45,091
in the font of all magic.

654
00:32:45,116 --> 00:32:46,123
And it's a stinker.

655
00:32:46,148 --> 00:32:48,131
I really hope you weren't
planning to drink from it.

656
00:32:48,155 --> 00:32:51,443
- It's hardly potable.
- You... what?

657
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:57,279
Left my leavings... a
godly floater... behind.

658
00:32:58,526 --> 00:33:00,293
In the Wellspring.

659
00:33:02,818 --> 00:33:04,051
I pooped in it.

660
00:33:04,086 --> 00:33:05,669
Am I not making this very clear?

661
00:33:06,115 --> 00:33:07,630
You wretched bastard.

662
00:33:08,115 --> 00:33:09,544
I know your true game.

663
00:33:09,677 --> 00:33:14,294
I know exactly every twist,
you... you stinking man-sheep!

664
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:15,929
Oh, my heavens. Look at the time.

665
00:33:15,965 --> 00:33:17,698
I really should be going,

666
00:33:17,733 --> 00:33:21,235
although technically, I already went.

667
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:24,779
I never tire of these jokes. Ta!

668
00:33:27,513 --> 00:33:29,826
Oh! Oh!

669
00:33:31,764 --> 00:33:32,942
Oh!

670
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:40,050
You stinking man-sheep!

671
00:33:40,085 --> 00:33:41,618
You're no god!

672
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:46,515
You're no god! You're a farm animal!
You're no god!

673
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,727
Ember actually took a
shit in the Wellspring?

674
00:33:48,752 --> 00:33:49,969
You're a farm animal!

675
00:33:49,994 --> 00:33:51,844
Well, that can't be good for Fillory.

676
00:33:57,907 --> 00:34:00,188
Quentin Coldwater!

677
00:34:00,454 --> 00:34:01,576
Shit.

678
00:34:01,611 --> 00:34:04,313
Why don't you and Alice come join me?

679
00:34:09,219 --> 00:34:10,418
Mm.

680
00:34:10,453 --> 00:34:12,053
You're weaker.

681
00:34:12,088 --> 00:34:13,921
And you're down six fingers.

682
00:34:15,091 --> 00:34:16,624
More than enough to kill you both.

683
00:34:18,428 --> 00:34:21,462
Hard to cast when you're sliced in two.

684
00:34:27,403 --> 00:34:29,055
Quentin!

685
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,606
You're a tough piece
of meat, aren't you?

686
00:34:31,641 --> 00:34:32,874
No matter.

687
00:34:42,452 --> 00:34:43,573
Aah!

688
00:34:44,362 --> 00:34:45,518
Ahh!

689
00:34:53,713 --> 00:34:55,338
I guess we're gonna die.

690
00:34:56,065 --> 00:34:58,099
To our pretty corpses.

691
00:34:58,134 --> 00:35:01,569
Children of Earth! I have returned.

692
00:35:01,604 --> 00:35:05,706
Spank my cheeks. You're both royalty.

693
00:35:05,778 --> 00:35:07,298
How delightful.

694
00:35:07,677 --> 00:35:10,081
You have come here to beseech me?

695
00:35:10,862 --> 00:35:12,885
Well, yes.

696
00:35:13,449 --> 00:35:17,551
We have come to beseech your uhm... aid.

697
00:35:17,587 --> 00:35:20,198
Of course! You shall have it.

698
00:35:20,549 --> 00:35:23,257
Oh. Oh, but then
you're going to miss it.

699
00:35:23,293 --> 00:35:25,059
- Miss what?
- All the action.

700
00:35:25,094 --> 00:35:26,627
Between you and me,

701
00:35:26,663 --> 00:35:28,963
I think Alice should make
this a very good show.

702
00:35:29,017 --> 00:35:30,423
No promises, though.

703
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:31,766
Cheerio! Happy ruling!

704
00:35:31,801 --> 00:35:33,424
- No...
- Ember, we...

705
00:35:34,416 --> 00:35:37,087
Great. Kicked us out before
we could even ask for the jizz.

706
00:35:37,112 --> 00:35:38,005
Margo, look.

707
00:35:39,265 --> 00:35:40,641
Is that all you got?

708
00:35:46,349 --> 00:35:48,823
You're not even a real
magician, are you, Martin?

709
00:35:48,848 --> 00:35:51,463
You're just a scared little boy.

710
00:35:52,055 --> 00:35:54,440
You wouldn't last an hour at Brakebills.

711
00:36:07,315 --> 00:36:08,436
Ahh!

712
00:36:08,604 --> 00:36:09,706
Jesus.

713
00:36:10,139 --> 00:36:11,939
Alice is going full "Harry Potter"

714
00:36:11,975 --> 00:36:13,774
part seven/eight over there.

715
00:36:13,962 --> 00:36:15,749
Oh, God. I hope we're winning.

716
00:36:20,533 --> 00:36:21,932
Damn it.

717
00:36:31,432 --> 00:36:32,665
Alice, what are you doing?

718
00:36:34,145 --> 00:36:36,604
No. Alice, don't. Stop, it'll...

719
00:36:36,629 --> 00:36:37,895
What is she doing?

720
00:36:38,273 --> 00:36:39,505
She can't. She'll Niffin out.

721
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,973
This is not good, Alice.

722
00:36:44,024 --> 00:36:45,290
Alice, stop!

723
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:46,526
It's okay.

724
00:36:47,295 --> 00:36:48,955
I've got this, Quentin.

725
00:36:52,018 --> 00:36:53,251
Alice, no!

726
00:37:02,729 --> 00:37:03,695
Alice!

727
00:37:07,588 --> 00:37:08,887
No!

728
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:18,916
Oops.

729
00:37:19,455 --> 00:37:20,678
Too far.

730
00:37:22,427 --> 00:37:23,759
Too bad.

731
00:37:25,932 --> 00:37:28,947
Let's finally finish this.

732
00:37:38,474 --> 00:37:40,006
I did it on purpose.

733
00:37:42,502 --> 00:37:43,760
Move.

734
00:37:45,456 --> 00:37:46,947
- Let's go.
- We have to go.

735
00:37:46,972 --> 00:37:48,447
Go on.

736
00:37:49,331 --> 00:37:51,166
Something you want to say?

737
00:37:52,565 --> 00:37:53,596
Alice.

738
00:37:54,202 --> 00:37:55,729
We can make a deal.

739
00:37:55,893 --> 00:37:58,002
Think of the fun we could have together.

740
00:37:58,697 --> 00:37:59,846
You don't have to...

741
00:37:59,871 --> 00:38:00,937
But I want to.

742
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:18,440
Disappointing.

743
00:38:28,054 --> 00:38:29,486
Your turn.

744
00:38:38,779 --> 00:38:40,201
Alice!

745
00:38:44,493 --> 00:38:46,497
You got her attention. Now what?

746
00:38:48,615 --> 00:38:51,708
I'm sorry for all the times
I was a total dick to you.

747
00:38:51,868 --> 00:38:54,146
You're talking like you
mean something to me.

748
00:38:54,294 --> 00:38:55,911
Okay. Just...

749
00:38:57,815 --> 00:38:59,448
Alice. Don't.

750
00:39:06,482 --> 00:39:08,013
Go back.

751
00:39:08,038 --> 00:39:09,607
Quentin says go free.

752
00:39:25,224 --> 00:39:26,404
Fuck.

753
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,537
Fuck.

754
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:58,372
Alice.

755
00:39:59,331 --> 00:40:00,552
Alice.

756
00:40:09,047 --> 00:40:11,115
Alice. Hey. Hey.

757
00:40:15,107 --> 00:40:17,232
Q, stop. You're hurt.

758
00:40:18,013 --> 00:40:19,966
Alice. Hey.

759
00:40:20,786 --> 00:40:21,919
You have to stop.

760
00:40:21,944 --> 00:40:23,479
Come on. She might be alive.

761
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:24,783
- Just stop.
- She might be alive.

762
00:40:24,807 --> 00:40:26,060
You have to stop.

763
00:40:26,265 --> 00:40:28,826
Q, you have to stop.

764
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,169
You have to stop.

765
00:40:32,987 --> 00:40:34,224
You have to stop.
