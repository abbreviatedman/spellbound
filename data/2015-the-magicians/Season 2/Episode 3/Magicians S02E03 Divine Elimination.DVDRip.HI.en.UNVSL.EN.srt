00:00:00,968 --> 00:00:02,903
QUENTIN: <i>Previously

00:00:03,904 --> 00:00:04,904
(SHRIEKS)

3
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:07,185
A zillion bucks says The
Beast comes back any minute.

4
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:08,241
So what's the plan?

5
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:09,519
QUENTIN: <i>Right,
okay, so here's the thing,</i>

6
00:00:09,543 --> 00:00:10,687
<i>I can't really touch the knife.</i>

7
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:11,974
<i>We need the power of a god.</i>

8
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:15,504
I have gifted you my
bestowal. Imbibe it.

9
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:17,983
The more it burns,
the less time we have.

10
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:19,747
There's a spell that
seems strong enough.

11
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,550
These are my students. They
are in need of the Rhinemann Ultra.

12
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:25,616
BIGBY: <i>No one but you can
be within 20 feet of the blast.</i>

13
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,672
DEAN: <i>Alice is going to take just
a few minutes to fully power up.</i>

14
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,427
This is a cacodemon.
They'll grow much bigger.

15
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:35,663
Unleash these and, believe me,
they'll keep The Beast plenty busy.

16
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:36,869
(INAUDIBLE)

17
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,230
Do you know what a Niffin is?

18
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:39,296
No.

19
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:43,469
EMILY: <i>It's when too much runs
through you. Only the magic is left.</i>

20
00:00:44,278 --> 00:00:47,578
Please fix my hands.

00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:49,879
RIVER WATCHER: <i>Go fuck yourself.</i>

22
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,043
I think I can help.

23
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:53,550
(SIGHS) Wow. I owe you for real.

24
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,816
You could die if you don't
get clear of The Beast.

25
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,400
You think I don't know
how dangerous he is?

26
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:59,052
No. Not him. Us.

27
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:01,561
Yeah, do what you want with
him, but not until I get Reynard.

28
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:04,792
Well, we can't merely
summon him. A god can resist.

29
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:06,527
I don't give a shit
about getting him.

30
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,228
You should. I didn't summon him.

31
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:11,170
I didn't get raped by
him. I have no skin in this.

32
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:12,729
Reynard is targeting Hedges.

33
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:14,507
(GAGS)

34
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:15,675
(COUGHING)

35
00:01:16,143 --> 00:01:18,305
Did you put some kind
of curse on the castle?

36
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:19,378
Did I?

37
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:25,175
The spell that won World War
II is called the Rhinemann Ultra?

38
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:26,777
It sounds like a
not-so-great beer.

39
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:27,853
Fine, it's a beer.

40
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,399
But it's a beer that we
can use to kill The Beast.

41
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:32,689
Meanwhile, Penny comes back
with cool, circa-1985 wrist chains.

42
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,637
Yeah, super cool how they
keep me from killing myself.

43
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:36,806
And then Dean Fogg gives
you all matching tramp stamps?

44
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,390
I thought tramp stamps were
supposed to be on our lower back.

45
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:41,899
(SIGHS) God, I feel like I
missed out on some crazy party

46
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:43,846
you'll be talking about
for the rest of your lives.

47
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:46,237
Say what you want, but we
brought back weapons and a plan.

48
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:47,786
What do you have
to show for yourself?

49
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:56,873
Ta-fucking-da!

50
00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:00,613
Your royal accoutrements.

51
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:06,422
This is ceremony, people. And I
expect you to slather yourselves in it.

52
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:07,893
Thank you, Eliot.

53
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:09,662
I missed you all.

54
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:11,930
And I was bored.

55
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:13,728
Come, sit.

56
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:15,860
Is this really the
most important thing

57
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,734
we could be doing right now?

58
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,949
I mean, The Beast is still
out there, waiting for us, and...

59
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,532
The Beast can
wait for five minutes.

60
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:24,100
You are all Kings
and Queens of Fillory.

61
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,307
Well, almost all of you.

62
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,647
Just revel in your majesty
for one fucking second.

63
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,120
Be regal, miscreants.

64
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,257
Mmm...

65
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,989
(ECHOING) You're
such a stupid, stupid man.

66
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:43,655
I'm gonna kill
you in your sleep.

67
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:44,857
(WHISPERING)

68
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:46,032
Poison.

69
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:48,696
(ECHOING) El, you
okay? (SHUDDERS)

70
00:02:49,302 --> 00:02:50,302
Totally fine. Why?

71
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:53,239
It's just... You went
away there for a minute.

72
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:56,667
Nonsense. I feel
great. Have a seat.

73
00:02:57,077 --> 00:03:01,242
I'm kind of on a clock here.
So, we should talk strategy.

74
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:02,392
Yeah, we already
talked strategy.

75
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:03,593
So, we just need
to catch you up.

76
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:04,727
You've been planning without me?

77
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,414
Yeah. When we were on Earth.
What did you think we were doing?

78
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:11,788
(LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)

79
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,953
Eliot, we're not trying to exclude
you. You just weren't there.

80
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:18,857
No. No, I wasn't, was I?

81
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,169
Don't think I don't
see how this works.

82
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:23,635
You disappear. You come back.

83
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:27,400
Matching tattoos. And now
you're three-against-one.

84
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:29,500
I know exactly what
you're planning. Eliot...

85
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:30,635
Don't touch me.

86
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,579
Sweetie, you kind
of sound insane.

87
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:35,675
Do I?

88
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:43,352
Because I promise you, I will
not go down easily, oo-surpers.

89
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:47,489
Usurpers.

90
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:50,793
(SCOFFS) Whichever way
you're supposed to pronounce it.

91
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:52,127
What just happened?

92
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:56,495
He got like this on 'shrooms
once. I'll go talk to him.

93
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:01,707
(SIGHS)

94
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,655
QUENTIN: I just remembered
something that Julia said.

95
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:07,119
It's starting to
make a lot of sense.

96
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,978
You talked to that
bitch? Yes, he did.

97
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,129
It was a warning.
Something The Beast said.

98
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,515
Uh... God! Of course,
this makes sense!

99
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,988
Yeah, I mean, he'd want to
booby trap his kingdom, right?

100
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:19,049
Uh, so, apparently
he left curses behind.

101
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,220
Here, actually.

102
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,423
So, you think Eliot
might be cursed?

103
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:26,433
I mean, she was vague.
But, I mean... (SIGHS)

104
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:29,602
Did either of you notice

105
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,365
that Eliot started
acting strangely

106
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,669
once he took a
drink from the goblet?

107
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:38,577
I mean, it could be
poison or potion...

108
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:44,346
Okay, well we probably shouldn't
drink from ours, just to be safe.

109
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,929
Or maybe it was just some primo
Fillorian shit that went up his nose

110
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:50,185
and he's on the bad end of a trip,
because he's him. (CHUCKLES)

111
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:54,327
Did something happen to you?

112
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,794
Nope. Nothing.

113
00:04:56,563 --> 00:04:58,862
I'm fine, Penny.

114
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:00,826
Oh.

115
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:06,997
Wait! And now you're doing it.

116
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:08,518
I don't know what
you're talking about.

117
00:05:08,542 --> 00:05:11,137
I mean like Eliot, you're
acting all tweaky and shit.

118
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,639
We're fine. We're fine.

119
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:14,847
Clearly.

120
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,568
Look, I think we can all agree
that we have a problem here.

121
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,118
Eliot.

122
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:25,090
He's High King. He's cursed.
We have no choice but...

123
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:28,261
We have to kill him. Exactly.

124
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,124
The thrones.

125
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:32,460
You're both cursed.

126
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:37,170
This is hard for you. I get
that. It's hard for us, too.

127
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:38,466
But it must be done.

128
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,340
For Fillory. For Fillory.

129
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,313
(WHISPERING)
But don't tell Quentin.

130
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:53,250
I'm going to have
to kill him, too.

131
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,948
Right after Margo.

132
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:06,394
PENNY: Margo!

133
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:08,632
Margo.

134
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:11,866
Margo! Margo! Margo! We
got a serious problem, okay?

135
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:13,770
I know. Eliot's cursed. No, no.

136
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,360
Not just Eliot. Alice
and Quentin, too.

137
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:18,276
Listen, whatever you do, do
not sit on your throne, okay?

138
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:21,509
(SIGHS) Fine.
Whatevs. I have a plan.

139
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:22,913
You gonna help me pick these?

140
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,144
What's this? An antidote?

141
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,617
Exactly. For the poison.

142
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:26,685
For the... What?

143
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:29,112
For the poison.

144
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:32,554
I have to drink it first or I
won't get Eliot to take it.

145
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:38,057
Jesus, you're acting like
this is your first regicide.

146
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,430
Also, it's not the
thrones that are cursed.

147
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,969
I sat on mine
and I'm totally fine.

148
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:46,370
You sat on your... Fuck!

149
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,499
Great! No, it's good. Okay.

150
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,635
Stop! This will be over soon.

151
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,646
I'll deal with Eliot,
and Alice and Q.

152
00:06:54,281 --> 00:06:55,321
Are you... You're welcome.

153
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:00,753
Shit.

154
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:22,774
MARINA: So, this is
our little fox trap, huh?

155
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:24,402
Yeah.

156
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:27,290
So you wanna tell me where
you hooked up with your partner?

157
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:28,646
The Dirty Dozen?

158
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,941
Hmm. Uh...

159
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:33,481
Fillory.

160
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,620
(CHUCKLES)

161
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:36,756
Fine, don't tell me.

162
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,690
Listen, I'm here.
I want to help.

163
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:42,888
But that asshole seems like

164
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,261
severe psychic damage.

165
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:45,924
Look, I get it, okay?

166
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:47,831
But he knows a
spell to freeze a god.

167
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:49,981
I mean, you can't find that
at your local safe house.

168
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:53,229
Look, I've survived
this long on my instincts.

169
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,276
And every one of them is
telling me that he is bad news.

170
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:59,745
He's gonna turn on me.
Or you. Or both of us.

171
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:03,147
No, he can't. Okay, we have
an agreement. Word As Bond.

172
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,276

Where'd you take me?

Subway's that way. Good
luck with your bullshit.

523
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,257
Hey! Take me back! I need him!

524
00:27:12,965 --> 00:27:15,400
I need The Beast to kill
Reynard! Reynard has the knife.

525
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,611
I can't do it without The Beast.

526
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,659
It's not my problem.

527
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:21,396
Oh, shit. Duck!

528
00:27:24,443 --> 00:27:25,467

529
00:27:25,544 --> 00:27:26,544
What the hell?

530
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:28,890
The chain was the only thing
keeping my hands from fucking...

531
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:30,109
Put it back on! I can't!

532
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:32,048
It's a ritual and I
don't have any of the...

(GRUNTING) Oh, no.

534
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:38,847
Thank you. Yeah, no problem.

535
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:43,620
You fucking...

536
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:45,721
Sorry. Not my problem.

537
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:46,797

ALICE: He's injured.
Where else would he be?

542
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:57,807
He has to be at the Wellspring.

543
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,787
The Royal Carriage can
get there in under an hour.

544
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:01,055
Okay, but if he
can just blip in...

545
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:03,878
Well, hopefully his accuracy
isn't at its best right now.

546
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:05,076
I know mine wouldn't be.

547
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:07,228
MARGO: Well, if those horses
get us there before The Beast,

548
00:28:07,252 --> 00:28:09,164
I'll gladly fuck them both.
ELIOT: Hey! (SHUSHES)

Hey, can you still do this?

I don't know. What
choice do we have?

554
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,846
Okay, we should send
El and Margo for help.

555
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,430
Wait. You don't want us on
the suicide mission with you?

556
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:32,035
Ember's temple is nearby. So
just go and petition him for a re-up.

557
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,203
Just in case Alice and I...

558
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:34,404
Fail? Die?

00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:37,342
Sorry. Reflex.

I would, um...

569
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,295
I'd eat an ice cream sundae.

570

With whipped cream and those
fake, rainbow-colored sprinkles.

571
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:32,231
And, I don't know,
gummy bears on top.

572
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:35,831
I'm probably gonna
try and win you back.

573
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:37,205
Jesus, Quentin!

574
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:39,053
I'm sorry. It just sort
of flew out of my mouth.

575
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:41,103
You know, I'm not a prize.

576
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,074
I know that. But you
know what I mean.

577
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:45,515
No, and you didn't
just lose me like keys.

578
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:50,855
I know. Which is why I feel like
I need to earn back your trust.

579
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:52,515
(SIGHS) This isn't fair.

580

This isn't fair. You
can't trap me in here.

581

You can't trap me in here

582
00:29:57,396 --> 00:29:59,173
and expect me to deal with
all this heavy emotional shit

583
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:00,597
when all I can
handle right now...

584
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:03,111
All I can handle right now is a
goddamn ice cream sundae, okay?

585
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:04,467
It's not a trap.

586
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:05,780
Yes, it is. Then why
does it sound like

587
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:06,981
you're trying to fight with me?

588
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:09,873
Look. You've changed, okay?

589
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:15,073
You're not the girl that I met a
million years ago. You're amazing.

590
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:18,740
And not that you weren't
amazing before, but...

591
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:21,614
Quentin, where are
you going with this?

592
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:23,250
You've grown.

593
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:27,890
And you're still growing.
And my point is that I am, too.

594
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:29,757
Are you saying you're
not that guy anymore?

595
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,388
No, I'm saying that I'm
not just that guy anymore.

596
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:33,955
And I think that you should...

597
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:36,001
I hope that you give
me the opportunity

598
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:39,800
to be better and
actually deserve you.

599

that sounds stupid,

but I feel like we
could die in like an hour

601
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:48,175
and that's giving me a
lot of clarity right now.

602

I don't know what
to say, Quentin.

603
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:56,351
Also I'm gonna make you the best
ice cream sundae you've ever had.

You're gonna
forget Popper No. 1,

um, gummy bears on it.

00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,542
You're just a scared little boy.

696
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,449

No! Alice, don't.
Stop! It'll... (GRUNTS)

00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,232
She can't, she'll Niffin out.

709
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,529
This is not good, Alice.

Oops!

Too far.

723
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,469
Too bad.

Something you want to say?

Alice, we could make a deal.

732
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:01,440
Think of the fun we
could have together.

733
00:38:01,513 --> 00:38:03,880
You don't have
to... But I want to.

734
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:21,222
Disappointing.

I'm sorry for all the times
I was a total dick to you.

mean something to me.

to stop. She might be...
