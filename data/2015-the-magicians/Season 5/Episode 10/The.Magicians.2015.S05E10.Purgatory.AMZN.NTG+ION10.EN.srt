1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,840
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,770
The Takers are swarming.

3
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:13,259
They're swarming because Seb
summoned them with a spell.

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,690
Okay, so what if we locate
the tree from Seb's tattoo

5
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:16,759
and chop it down?

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,849
Would that sever this conduit?

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,909
In theory, yes.

8
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,939
He would be mortal and 100% stab-able.

9
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:28,019
I wouldn't if I were you.

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,529
Surprised?

11
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,240
I just have a problem,
and it's getting worse.

12
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,350
Whoa.

13
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,029
I traveled us to 1998.

14
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,610
This is where the signal brought us.

15
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,390
It was just a room.

16
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,499
No windows, no doors.

17
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,340
We can't leave.

18
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,090
That's Ms. Persephone.

19
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,629
That's Our Lady Underground.

20
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,419
When the sister was in me,

21
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,179
I remember everything.

22
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,559
Promise. Give me the page.

23
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,460
If the finger's still
viable, I reattach.

24
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,970
- Hey, what happened to your eye?
- I lent it to Josh.

25
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,979
I'm keeping an eye on him, okay?

26
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,439
Hold up.

27
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,899
Somebody's near Josh.

28
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,010
It's the Dark King. He's coming.

29
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:20,820
Your Highness.

30
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,589
I mean, Your Majesty.

31
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,460
- I think there's been a huge...
- No mistake.

32
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,829
You were part of the plot
to kill me, were you not?

33
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,249
- I wouldn't say that exactly.
- It doesn't matter.

34
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:32,630
There is a way you can make it up to me.

35
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,839
To Fillory.

36
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,799
Okay, sure. Uh, what?

37
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,259
Down.

38
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:42,390
You are a brave, brave man.

39
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:47,910
Right. Thank you.

40
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,780
Uh... oh, is this a blood
brothers kind of thing?

41
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,859
I'm guessing this isn't
a medal of valor.

42
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:03,949
What are you doing?

43
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,499
Your death will not be in vain.

44
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,880
But I will miss your cooking.

45
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:15,919
What?

46
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,339
No. No. No, no, please.

47
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,790
Please, please.

48
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,630
No, no, no.

49
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,349
No.

50
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,610
The walls are solid.

51
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,119
There's no buttons or switches.

52
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,499
Everything I cast is wrong here.

53
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,530
Circumstances are impossible to read.

54
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,090
Okay, are you sure

55
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,150
this is the room that the
signal brought you to?

56
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,979
Yes, but I can't remember where here is.

57
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,500
Oh, good.

58
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,649
I've still got the welter's plaque.

59
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,750
Let's just try again.

60
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,600
It didn't work last time.

61
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,559
Come, come. Sit, sit, sit, sit.

62
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,030
The signal pulled us back.
You were right.

63
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,319
That's why you should listen
to your elders, Plum.

64
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,440
Who the hell are you?

65
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,290
That was a Tiffany lamp, you know.

66
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,070
Crafted from a design I acquired

67
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,739
from Clara Driscoll herself.
It took me ages to make.

68
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,210
Do I need to tell you how
much I don't give a shit?

69
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,610
Why are we here? What do you want?

70
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,320
I want you to stop time traveling.

71
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:37,730
Are you, like, the God of Time

72
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,959
- or something?
- Hardly.

73
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,790
I'm a time traveler
like young Plum here.

74
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,379
I have been monitoring you.

75
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,520
And now you're keeping us prisoner?

76
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,810
This one will be smart, I thought.

77
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,739
Cautious.

78
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,809
Then you had to risk altering the future

79
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,439
to save some young pervert.

80
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,479
So is this the part where
you draw us little diagrams

81
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,630
about screwing up the
flow of time or whatever?

82
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,190
Nice thing about the 21st century.

83
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,699
You've all seen "Looper."

84
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,479
So I can get to the point.

85
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,589
We are here because though I
would rather be making lamps,

86
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,660
I am forced to focus on the
most important task there is,

87
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,550
protecting the integrity of space-time.

88
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,750
Which you threaten.

89
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,230
I'd have hoped you'd waste
your time on something useful.

90
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,049
Try to kill Hitler at least.

91
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,420
I was getting to it.

92
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,639
I'm not an asshole. I just found out.

93
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,969
Well, doing any of those
things would be...

94
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,850
Would be a royal cluster.

95
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:33,880
We get it.

96
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:37,390
- She gets it.
- Yeah, she does loud and clear.

97
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,519
We promise not to change
the past anymore.

98
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,529
Can we leave?

99
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,360
Well, this isn't a
pinky-swear situation.

100
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,110
I know how intoxicating

101
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,480
the prospect of altering time can be.

102
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,740
"Just this once."

103
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,799
I'd like to relieve you of that burden.

104
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,169
This device neutralizes your abilities.

105
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,169
- It's painless...
- It's got fucking teeth.

106
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,330
It's painless once it's on.

107
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:09,390
Works quickly and
permanently to eradicate.

108
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,099
And you can still traverse
space like your peers.

109
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,670
Traveling is in our DNA.

110
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,089
What exactly would you be eradicating?

111
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,150
Plum, you and I

112
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,110
have a mutation of the
plasma factor of the blood.

113
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,690
Luckily, we stop producing
it by the time we can walk.

114
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,190
What's in you now, it's finite.

115
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,329
When we traverse time,
we use up a fraction of it.

116
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:35,789
So you want to take away
the thing that makes me, me?

117
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,539
That's dramatic.

118
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,079
I'm offering to rid you of your curse.

119
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,120
I can't force you.

120
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,110
You must consent

121
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,680
or the spell work won't
function. It's up to you.

122
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,929
I'm offering to free you.

123
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:53,030
No, this is crazy.

124
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,059
You have no right to
drag us both here...

125
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,659
I didn't.

126
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,510
You, Professor, are a hanger-on.

127
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,269
The signal was meant for her.

128
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,640
I won't do it.

129
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,950
Oh, they can never just say yes.

130
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,819
Well, whenever you change your mind,

131
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,319
simply place your arm inside the cuff.

132
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,979
He can't help you.
You have to do it yourself.

133
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,649
Till then, enjoy my space out of time.

134
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,649
My name is Eliphas, by the way.

135
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,150
Friends call me Eli.

136
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,630
So Eliphas.

137
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,010
Is he just gonna leave us here?

138
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:47,680
- Synced & corrected by<font color="#E83286"> MementMori </font>-
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.addic7ed.com</font> --

139
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,190
How do they feel?

140
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,820
Like ghost fingers.

141
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:00,490
They work, but magically,
they still feel severed.

142
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,610
So you can't cast?

143
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,299
Not really, no.

144
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,530
One-handed

145
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,629
and that pretty much
rules out most spells.

146
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:13,469
I'm not gonna forget what you did.

147
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,389
We're gonna get those pricks for this.

148
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:20,139
I don't know, Kady. Maybe
we should just walk away.

149
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,110
You can walk away, but to be clear,

150
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,679
I'm not done until I cut that
son of a bitch's balls off.

151
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,719
I owe them that for tying me up,

152
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,649
and I owe them triple for
what they did to you.

153
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,749
You can sit it out, okay?

154
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:34,949
Um, no. We're in this together.

155
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,659
Oh, it's just so beautiful, you guys.

156
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,999
Female friendship really is

157
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,169
the most underrated form of love, right?

158
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,820
I'm sorry. I'm extra emotional.

159
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,909
I just... the assassination
going sideways,

160
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:55,139
and then Josh and Eliot and
Julia not making it back.

161
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,760
Not to mention all that
crazy stuff Plover told us.

162
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,599
It's just... It's really overwhelming.

163
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,230
So, um, what have you guys been up to?

164
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,980
No, no. No, no.

165
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,530
Okay, okay, okay.

166
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,310
Josh, Josh, calm, calm.

167
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,769
You are in...

168
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:52,299
Taker Home Base Land, I guess? Or...

169
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,569
never fear. No reason to fear

170
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,630
because Taker Kryptonite
for some reason.

171
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,630
Focus. Mission, get home.

172
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,039
Also don't die.

173
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,119
When you were lost at "Burning Man,"

174
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,350
what did you do? You...

175
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,990
called Margo.

176
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,889
Voldemort's clit.

177
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,559
- Wait, where's Josh?
- Where the Takers come from.

178
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,450
I don't understand. Is it in Fillory?

179
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,229
Sure as shit doesn't look like it.

180
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:27,799
So then why is Josh there?

181
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,470
No clue, but seems
stuck, wandering around.

182
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,680
And it's, it's...

183
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:35,070
Stop moving the damn camera, Josh.

184
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,069
It's like I'm watching "Cloverfield."

185
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,890
I really don't think my eye

186
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,500
likes being in a
different world than me.

187
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,079
Is that my blood?

188
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,959
- Oh, God.
- Margo.

189
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,999
Um, hey, not an expert,
but does that seem...

190
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,450
Real goddamn bad.

191
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,390
Is there a spell or something

192
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,199
to calm fairy eyes transmitting
from foreign realms?

193
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,470
Even assuming yes,

194
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,130
casting's ultra moon-jacked today.

195
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,185
I can't say I'd risk it.

196
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,850
I have an idea.

197
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:11,110
- Is she trying to do magic?
- Mm-hmm.

198
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,949
Should you tell her
that's a waste of time?

199
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,359
Should I? It seems like it's helping.

200
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,730
Hmm?

201
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,659
Hey, uh, a gentle reminder:

202
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,449
this is a magic-proof cell, so...

203
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:26,690
the hedge-witch-explosive
arts and crafts

204
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,199
are at best wishful thinking.

205
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,499
And you didn't think to tell
me that 45 minutes ago?

206
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,120
It seemed like you needed an activity.

207
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,790
I'm honestly trying to help.

208
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,969
It's bad enough for me, and I don't
even have a human inside me.

209
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,220
Except you do, technically.

210
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,299
Shit.

211
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,300
Now there's nothing to do.

212
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:48,530
I really let it go on as
long as I felt morally able.

213
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,690
What are we going to do, Eliot?

214
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,850
We'll think of something?

215
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,109
Is that a question?

216
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:57,450
I am trying my best to calm you down...

217
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,590
Calm me down? What am I,

218
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,899
a maiden with the vapors?

219
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,779
- You're upset...
- I'm not upset.

220
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:05,039
I'm locked in a dungeon during
Red fucking Monkey month

221
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,170
with this baby growing inside
me like a weed on HGH,

222
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,630
on a planet without so much
as a fucking prenatal vitamin.

223
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,399
But no, I'm not upset.
I don't get upset.

224
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,423
I figure it out.

225
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,500
There is always something.

226
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,010
- Is there?
- Of course there is.

227
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,040
I agree.

228
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,450
Do you?

229
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:24,350
Do you actually believe that?

230
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,509
Um...

231
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,469
I can't believe I thought
I could fix this.

232
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,630
I'm the reason we're
here in the first place.

233
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,770
Hey.

234
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,019
- I wouldn't say that...
- No.

235
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,369
Face it, I failed, Eliot.

236
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,969
You didn't fail, you're just tired.

237
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,069
You're cooped up...

238
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,830
I stole a quest, I got it wrong.

239
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,079
I screwed magic on Earth,
I screwed us here.

240
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,750
And the thing about it is, you know,

241
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,510
facing ever increasing bad odds

242
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,110
is that you have to be really good

243
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,090
at thinking of the next thing to try.

244
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,310
Hey, let's just take
a deep breath, okay?

245
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,589
- We'll just...
- I mean, there is nothing else.

246
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,129
We are done.

247
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:01,419
- No.
- We're gonna die here.

248
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,750
My baby is going to die here.
We are gonna die.

249
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,059
- And it all went to shit.
- Hey, hey, hey.

250
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,469
You're just, you're having a moment...

251
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,469
This is not a moment. It's my life.

252
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,129
You need to calm her.

253
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,729
She's gonna give the baby bad humors.

254
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:16,019
I just heard a voice say bad humors?

255
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,769
- You heard that?
- You heard me?

256
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,239
Can you still hear me?
This is wonderful.

257
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,699
- Yeah.
- My name is Charlton.

258
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,980
What the fuck's a Charlton?

259
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,789
So there's a man inside
your head and I heard him?

260
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:32,140
- That's it, more or less.
- An excellent summation.

261
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,050
Why all of a sudden could I hear him?

262
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,129
And then why did it stop?

263
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,299
I don't know.

264
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,089
Well...

265
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,880
Her weird baby is developing.

266
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,770
My mother, who was a midwife,

267
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,932
once tended a lady pregnant by a nixie.

268
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:47,599
She often sleepwalked

269
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,309
into the sea, but no ill befell her,

270
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,190
because she developed gestational gills.

271
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,440
Charlton theorizes that
you had a psychic attack

272
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:56,870
because of, well,

273
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,319
who and what the baby daddy is.

274
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,039
Wait, so you're saying that's a thing?

275
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,030
Me being able to take on
what the baby can do?

276
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,076
Maybe.

277
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,330
Well, maybe this baby is a traveler.

278
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,488
I mean that'd be pretty goddamn
handy right about now, no?

279
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,539
Mm-hmm.

280
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,499
Okay, we need to quantify this shit.

281
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,129
What's happening, how can I control it,

282
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,049
keep baby safe, and get
us the hell out of here.

283
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:21,450
I studied this. First year.

284
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,090
They make us take sex ed,

285
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,270
inter-magician relations
being so fraught

286
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,929
with STIs and peril.

287
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,099
I think we may have covered this stuff.

288
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,590
- You think, or...
- I'm not proud,

289
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,470
but I was on a...

290
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,330
record amount of greenhouse cannabis.

291
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,979
And so while technically I
heard every single word,

292
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,859
it was all, you know, Sondheim lyrics.

293
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,529
I was there, but in a greater sense,

294
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:47,030
was I there?

295
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,370
Well, perhaps I can help.

296
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,539
If you were, as you say, there,

297
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,039
perhaps the remembrance itself is...

298
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,580
Is intact in here still
somehow, that is brilliant.

299
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,749
- Can you go...
- Yeah, I can certainly attempt.

300
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:00,169
My imaginary friend is on it.

301
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,258
Great.

302
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,178
"Dos and don'ts

303
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,189
of magical intercourse."

304
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,889
I avoided real college

305
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,720
so I wouldn't have
to see shit like this.

306
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:14,430
You kidding? This is
spank bank material.

307
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,979
If it burns when you pee,

308
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,649
infirmary.

309
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,109
Red bumps like a curse,

310
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,839
see a nurse.

311
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,909
Scales, feathers, furs...

312
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,939
Medical attention that rhymes with fur,

313
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,110
read you loud and clear.

314
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,979
Now, let's chat procreation, shall we?

315
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,709
Let's start with some basics.

316
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,849
Do not assume

317
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,690
that your classmate is human

318
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,089
just because they look it.
Hybrids abound.

319
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:42,757
DNA magic develops in utero

320
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,150
which can affect the
mother unpredictably,

321
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,259
which can, of course, result in maiming

322
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,969
or death.

323
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,338
If you think you've been impregnated

324
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,099
by a hybrid or creature,

325
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,969
you may want to take precautions

326
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,689
to prevent any episodes.

327
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,679
Let's go over a few, shall we?

328
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,730
Excuse me, wait, I have questions.

329
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,100
Who are you?

330
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,610
You are not a student here.

331
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,710
Of course I am.

332
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,450
I did a thing to my face. Hello, it's...

333
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,619
Todd.

334
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:14,270
Todd.

335
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,619
Yes, what's your question?

336
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,159
What if a person wanted the episodes?

337
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,669
Let's say the fetus was
psychic, or even a traveler.

338
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,210
I cannot speak to that.

339
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,150
Well, but you are speaking to that.

340
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,860
This is a memory.

341
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,990
I made no mention of
travelers specifically.

342
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,550
Okay, but say I wanted my baby to...

343
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,710
I can only tell you what's
happening in this memory, Todd.

344
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,979
And how to prevent it.

345
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,079
But that won't help me.
You see, I need to know...

346
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,680
Hey, genius.

347
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,730
Why don't you just let him
tell you how to stop it

348
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,020
and do the opposite?

349
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,359
It's a defense mechanism.

350
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,075
The fetus detects the mother's distress

351
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,829
and reacts protectively.

352
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,330
You freaked the baby out
with your meltdown,

353
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,820
so it psyched you up.

354
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,220
Next?

355
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,209
And this can be avoided by
cultivating a tranquil mind.

356
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,730
Soothing teas, meditation...

357
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,209
Can we just skip to the part
where Julia travels to safety?

358
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:07,759
Oh, right, then she'll need to
aggressively do the opposite.

359
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,400
The opposite of tea and meditation?

360
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:11,649
Wait, is he saying I need
to freak out more?

361
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:14,170
She needs to feel imminent
life or death danger, yes.

362
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,530
Basically.

363
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,350
We need to scare the
living shit out of you.

364
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,350
Great.

365
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,130
This is fine. Totally fine.

366
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,959
Just a totally normal walk

367
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,319
through a totally normal forest.

368
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,030
You can't hear that, but that is a Taker

369
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,730
screaming for some reason.

370
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,169
Whose eye is that?

371
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:44,949
Nobody's. It's...

372
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,960
my girlfriend's eye.

373
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,119
That's not better, you know?

374
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,289
She lent it to me.

375
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,800
Where did you come from?

376
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,859
How about that? So did I.

377
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,059
So how did you end up down here?

378
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,529
I was taken with my friends.

379
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,869
Friends. Friends are good.

380
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,140
Uh, where are they?

381
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:07,180
The Takers put them
in a big, shiny cave.

382
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,699
It opens sideways.

383
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,198
And when you poke its big, yellow eye,

384
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,530
its mouth opens and says "ding."

385
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:17,329
That sounds like an elevator.

386
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:18,720
Is that a kind of monster?

387
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,789
No, not a monster. A machine.

388
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,990
That eats people?

389
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,770
No, it goes up,

390
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,059
it goes down.

391
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:27,950
It's just weird that it's here.

392
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,038
Maybe we should check it out.

393
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,058
- Do you know where...
- Are you an adult?

394
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,750
Of course. Do I not seem like an adult?

395
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,300
Adults lie

396
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,630
and say everything's okay
when it really isn't.

397
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,017
Then Takers come.

398
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,599
I'm not helping an adult.

399
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,689
Oh, please. No.

400
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:45,560
God, just wait!

401
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,310
No, wait! No!

402
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,319
No, don't touch. Let me go.

403
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,379
- No, let me go.
- Hey.

404
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,730
- No, no, no!
- Hey.

405
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,020
Uh, you like this?

406
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,739
Yeah, shiny, right?

407
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,160
Yeah, good. Go get it.

408
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:02,740
Hey, hey, hey, you okay?

409
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,329
Yeah. How did you do that?

410
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,377
Luck. Let's get the hell out of here.

411
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,590
That'll do it.

412
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:13,439
My own personal Mar-Go-Pro.

413
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,219
Trust me, where I'm from,
that was really clever.

414
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,809
Well, here it's stupid, okay?

415
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:18,840
Now here's the cave over there, okay?

416
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,889
Okay. Looks clear.

417
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:24,479
Let's get a little closer
and see where it goes.

418
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,890
Come on. Shh.

419
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:34,779
_

420
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,370
- Underworld?
- Do we not want to go there?

421
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,740
Uh...

422
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,380
Underworld sounds pretty good right now.

423
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,169
Come on. Come on!

424
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,089
Oh!

425
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,759
Not today, Takers.

426
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:00,139
But where are we going?

427
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,197
So this is the Underworld?

428
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,010
And it's where we go when we die?

429
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,650
Does this mean we're dead?

430
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,160
No, no, we're not.

431
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:28,749
I mean, neither of us died.

432
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,949
Technically, so...

433
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,256
Are my friends dead?

434
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,989
Look.

435
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,339
I don't know.

436
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,309
And I'm not gonna lie, this isn't good.

437
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,720
But I promise you

438
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:48,070
I'm going to whatever I can to
get us both out of here, okay?

439
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,560
You better.

440
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,639
Let's see if we can find some help.

441
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:01,740
"Welcome, you are dead.
Please take a card."

442
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,550
Take a card.

443
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,957
You can read, can't you?

444
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,690
Right, question.

445
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,910
Where do we go if we...

446
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,160
aren't dead?

447
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,610
If you're here, you're dead.

448
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,730
And if you're dead, you take a card.

449
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,763
But I'm not dead.

450
00:20:21,764 --> 00:20:23,950
I can't be dead. Please, mister.

451
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,889
There must be someone we can talk to.

452
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,640
Great, now look what you've done.

453
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,109
I'll see if I can find someone.

454
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:33,770
Hey, hey, hey, hey. You okay?

455
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,230
Of course. I do this all the time.

456
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,569
Crying makes adults uncomfortable.

457
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,190
Not bad.

458
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,989
Hoberman?

459
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,089
- Penny?
- What the fuck?

460
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,750
What are you doing here?

461
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,230
Remind me why you dragged
me to the Brakebills Lab

462
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,800
instead of staying in our
comfortable penthouse?

463
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:57,818
We had to bring you somewhere

464
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,619
where we could control circumstances.

465
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,169
Besides, I'm going to have to
rely on Kady to do any casting.

466
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:04,130
I don't even know what to start.

467
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,259
Trash can.

468
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,179
- Oh. Okay.
- What?

469
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,830
That I can handle.

470
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,489
I can see the tether
between you and your eye

471
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:20,050
and it's kind of between worlds.

472
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,110
It's all glitchy.

473
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,439
I think we should sever the connection

474
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,109
before it does permanent damage.

475
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:28,489
My fairy eye is the only
connection I have to Josh.

476
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,989
You cut that out, I cut out your uterus.

477
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,020
Uh, Margo? Just a gentle observation.

478
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,290
If you scorch your brain pan,

479
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,708
that won't be great for Josh either.

480
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:39,250
Okay.

481
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,689
Okay.

482
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:47,920
That won't work for long,

483
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,759
so we're gonna need
a solution yesterday.

484
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,880
Yeah, okay. You stay with her.

485
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:54,520
Fen, come with me.
I'm going to need help.

486
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:04,819
I'm gonna need to get a
couple other things stat.

487
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,029
I can only bring authorized items.

488
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:09,020
Well...

489
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,659
Then ask a doctor about premature labor.

490
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,950
And get it authorized.

491
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,570
Now.

492
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,030
Ow.

493
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,120
Five stalks green nightshade,

494
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:24,629
one dead quail unplucked, rock salt,

495
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,970
and two fingers of bourbon. Now.

496
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,100
Ow, ow. It really hurts.

497
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,919
Ask the king if he wants
this woman to die.

498
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,120
I need to cast something
to stop her pain.

499
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:36,470
Or alternately, oceans of
blood on your hands, friend.

500
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,430
Chop chop.

501
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,099
Hey.

502
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,179
Psst.

503
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,769
Okay, so what's all that really for?

504
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:46,680
I need you scared, and
you don't scare easy.

505
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:49,400
So the less you know, the better.

506
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,660
Gruel?

507
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,689
Hey, you think Ash will be fine

508
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:57,909
with, uh, what's-her-name, right?

509
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,629
Kathy?

510
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,799
Old friend. She's great with kids.

511
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,550
Should feel like recess plus birthday.

512
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,140
It's just me and the
kid kind of have this

513
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:11,890
Newt and Ripley thing going.
I promised I'd get her home.

514
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,779
Then I should get the bad
news out of the way.

515
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,470
- I can't help you.
- Why the hell not?

516
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,130
Take a look around.

517
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,370
Librarians have been going
through some shit lately.

518
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:26,380
No magic, too much magic,
but unpredictable.

519
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:30,189
A lot of our folks got
relocated, and we...

520
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:33,140
kind of don't exactly know where.

521
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:34,619
Okay, perfect world,

522
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,480
boss steps in, oversees shit.

523
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,530
But...

524
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,670
Hades is vanished.

525
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:45,709
Your boss is the god, Hades?

526
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,169
That's cool,

527
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:49,459
except for the abandoning you part.

528
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,470
I can't say that's great.

529
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,260
Kind of skeleton crew.

530
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,849
And here's the bad news for you.

531
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,649
Our connection to the
world of the living?

532
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,880
Hades controls that.

533
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:01,849
And right before he FO'd,
he flipped the switch.

534
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:03,229
Why?

535
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,110
Man, dead you is just way more zen.

536
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,310
Uh... So after all that,
why did you stay?

537
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,029
I make a promise, I keep it.

538
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:17,790
Look, bro, I hear you and bad timing.

539
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,860
But me and the kid? We didn't die.

540
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:22,039
We just got dragged into
a weird netherworld

541
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,770
- by the Takers.
- Right, you said.

542
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,980
Never heard of them.

543
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:28,360
Well, I promise you
they're real and they suck.

544
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:30,560
And we are in the wrong place.

545
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:32,749
I mean, this can't be
the first time in history

546
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,250
not dead people ended up here, right?

547
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,520
Accidents happen.

548
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,050
There's got to be some protocol

549
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,860
or some special dispensation thing.

550
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,899
Anyone sent to the Underworld by mistake

551
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,059
has 24 hours to file a dispute.

552
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,930
Great, let's file a dispute.

553
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:49,940
Disputes have to be sent up top.

554
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,269
And since Hades left, we can't.

555
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:57,319
So if we don't find Hades,
we're just stuck?

556
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,699
I'm sorry.

557
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:03,480
Does he have, like, a pager or a walkie?

558
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:05,459
If he doesn't want to
be found, he won't be.

559
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,689
The Underworld is big.

560
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:09,160
He could be anywhere.

561
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:10,923
Well could I maybe get a map

562
00:25:10,924 --> 00:25:12,650
and start checking things off?

563
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,699
Shit.

564
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:20,759
I might know someone who can help.

565
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:24,310
God, but it is the suck option.

566
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:31,649
Penny, you got my invite.

567
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:33,109
Uh...

568
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:35,739
Oh, you need something.

569
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,279
Sorry, man.

570
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,889
This is so typical.

571
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:42,159
You don't come to my brunches,
which I guess is fine,

572
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,680
but you could at least RSVP.

573
00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:46,960
That is the polite thing to do

574
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:49,040
so he doesn't have too much food.

575
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:53,339
That makes sense.

576
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:56,040
Anyway, we need an expert.

577
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:57,320
That is why we're here.

578
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:58,641
And I gather you are the guy

579
00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:00,889
who knows where everything is.

580
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:04,709
Well, I do know a thing or two.

581
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:06,249
And I am very generous with my time,

582
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:07,479
unlike some people.

583
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,920
We are looking for Hades.

584
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:11,609
Penny thinks you might know where he is.

585
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:13,049
I have no idea.

586
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:15,019
Penny told you he disappeared, right?

587
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,260
Very odd.

588
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,364
Usually there's at least

589
00:26:17,365 --> 00:26:19,520
one person who can get
a hold of him. This time...

590
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:21,920
But you know all his spots?

591
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:24,690
Gods no. Quite the opposite.

592
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,950
He is insanely strict on me.

593
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,499
You know, I'm not even allowed to map

594
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,469
the place where he...

595
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,960
Wait a minute.

596
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:38,000
He forbade me from mapping
an area in the Underworld.

597
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:40,799
I always suspected he had some
kind of special retreat there.

598
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,980
I'm sorry, if it's not on the map,

599
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,710
what good would that do us?

600
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,700
Well, because I mapped
everything else around it.

601
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:51,399
So in an ironic way, it's like
I mapped it... perfectly.

602
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,409
Is it time to put another
scratch mark up?

603
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:05,909
It's been a day, right?

604
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:07,909
I can't tell anymore.

605
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:10,580
I think your count is short.

606
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:13,459
We've been here longer than a month.

607
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,999
This whole conversation is predicated

608
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,779
on time having meaning,

609
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:20,929
which it doesn't in here, so.

610
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:26,670
A time traveler walks into
a bar in Vienna, 1908.

611
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,620
Sits next to a young art student

612
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,640
named Adolf Hitler.

613
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:35,280
Adolf sighs into his beer.

614
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:37,281
"You know what I hate?" he asks.

615
00:27:37,282 --> 00:27:39,699
Time traveler says,

616
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,380
"I don't know, Jews?"

617
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:47,290
And Hitler goes, "Huh,
now that you mention it."

618
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:51,419
- I mean, you got to laugh, right?
- You're right.

619
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,959
There are no good jokes
about time traveling.

620
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,320
At first, I thought it
was better at least

621
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:58,370
that we don't get hungry or tired

622
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,480
or need to pee.

623
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:00,620
But it's just...

624
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,460
Fucking torture.

625
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:06,869
The sameness. It is intolerable.

626
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:11,099
Hey, hey, hey. We are tolerating fine.

627
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,769
Hey, we are going to figure this out.

628
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:15,909
There is nothing to figure out.

629
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:18,689
It is what it is.

630
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:23,610
There is just one decision.

631
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,660
I'd still be a regular traveler.

632
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,199
No, that's not happening.

633
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,740
This is it, Penny. The Chatwin curse.

634
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,469
The tipping of the scale.

635
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,469
No, this is just some
self-important asshole

636
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:35,789
we need to outsmart.

637
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:37,920
I'm not letting you be
forced into a decision

638
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:38,998
that's gonna ruin your life.

639
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,750
It's not my life exactly, it's...

640
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,540
You don't know what it is.

641
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:46,509
You are at the beginning.
That's why, no.

642
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:50,509
We could be here forever

643
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:52,939
if we don't do something.

644
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,389
- What are you doing?
- I'm making my decision.

645
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,889
Wow.

646
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:39,470
The Underworld is in shambles,
and Hades is out here doing...

647
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,999
whatever this is?

648
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,769
Pink Himalayan sea salt.

649
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:48,060
I do a great salt-crusted
cod with a lovely...

650
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,409
You know what, never mind.

651
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:51,719
- Not important.
- He uses it as a spa bath.

652
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,780
It extracts toxins.

653
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,159
It's a great stress releaser if you...

654
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,280
- So I've heard.
- Excuse me.

655
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:58,030
This temple is off limits.

656
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,789
Yes, hi. We are looking for Hades.

657
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,410
He's unavailable.

658
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,459
Respectfully,

659
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,390
we wouldn't come here
if it wasn't urgent.

660
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,759
Can you please let him
know that we are here?

661
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,429
No, he's gone.

662
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:10,719
Well, he can't just be gone.

663
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,639
I assume you're here because
he just up and left.

664
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,809
And you're worried it was for good.

665
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:17,389
Well, I'm sorry to tell you,

666
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,479
when he left, he told me
he might never be back.

667
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,059
- Wait, what?
- Never?

668
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,070
He didn't feel like elaborating.

669
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,109
It's just some of us

670
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,709
are trying to keep the
Underworld running.

671
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:28,159
Yeah, and some of us
are trying to map it.

672
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,390
And he is a god.

673
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,909
He doesn't answer to any of you.

674
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:34,360
- Well, excuse me, please...
- Uh, guys?

675
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:35,660
I think I got something.

676
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,879
Let's just hope Margo's still watching.

677
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,889
So here's the plan.

678
00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:46,259
We separate the signal before
it enters Margo's brain

679
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,430
and then we deflect it.

680
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,679
Like put it somewhere else? How?

681
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,939
With this.

682
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,909
Now, I have a mixed history
with prism spells,

683
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:56,970
so you're going to need
to check my math.

684
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,850
This feels weird as fuck.

685
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:02,729
Just don't move.

686
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:05,399
Did you... did you poke her brain parts?

687
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,850
What?

688
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,250
How does that feel?

689
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,950
Like you just stuck a flash
drive into my jello hole.

690
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,679
Oh, my God. I feel
something coming through.

691
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,499
What the fuck?

692
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,919
Oh, channel Josh is live.

693
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,879
How does it feel?

694
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,690
Like I'm getting acupuncture
inside my brain,

695
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,709
but it doesn't hurt.

696
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:30,379
Well, thank God he's alive.

697
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:33,789
Except where the shitfaced Jesus is he?

698
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:37,029
Wait, why is Penny in Taker Land?

699
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:39,179
That's not... that's not that Penny.

700
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:41,639
That's... that's Penny. That's my Penny.

701
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,850
But that would mean that
Josh is in the Underworld.

702
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,399
No, no, no, no, no. That would mean...

703
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,569
Josh is dead?

704
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:51,940
Maybe he's trying to tell
us that he's still alive

705
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,020
and needs our help.

706
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,900
_

707
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:57,500
But I don't get it.
Isn't Hades down there?

708
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:59,910
I am so confused.

709
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,370
An address! In Queens!

710
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:07,510
- Hades is on Earth?
- Well, shit, go check.

711
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,960
I'd come with, but I've got
a goddamn movie projector

712
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,589
stuck in my eye hole.

713
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:15,549
Okay, now arrange the
feathers in front of you

714
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:19,179
in a triangle, and then drink this.

715
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,429
What's the bourbon for?

716
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,320
It's for me.

717
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:28,110
Ugh.

718
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,740
Okay, so, um, this isn't going
to do anything to you to you

719
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,069
or mini you physically.

720
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:37,589
But, um, you will feel a huge
shot of fear and anxiety,

721
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,070
and it's not gonna be nice.

722
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,626
So hopefully that'll do something.

723
00:32:40,627 --> 00:32:42,859
Okay, bottoms up.

724
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:47,099
Now listen to exactly
what I'm going to say

725
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:51,049
because the next part can
get a little bit, um...

726
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:53,719
... weird.

727
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,089
Okay, on my count.

728
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:58,599
Three, two...

729
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:02,099
What?

730
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:04,850
Oh, my God. My water just broke.

731
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,210
- What?
- That's very bad.

732
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,720
Oh, my God, the baby's coming, Eliot.

733
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:08,779
Tell her to lay on her back.

734
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,599
I can't lay on back. It's coming.

735
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,410
It's too soon. This is way too soon.

736
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,099
Eliot, please, do something.
You have to get a guard.

737
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,409
- Guard!
- They won't come.

738
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:17,909
- They never come between meals.
- Oh, shit.

739
00:33:17,910 --> 00:33:20,449
- I'm sorry.
- Eliot, you have to get us out of here.

740
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:22,740
I can't. Tell the baby.

741
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,659
Okay. Okay, baby,

742
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,169
we got to go. We got to go. Okay, baby?

743
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,459
We got to go. Oh, we got to go.

744
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,190
Okay, how does Penny travel?

745
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,700
He pictures it in his mind, right?

746
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,849
Right, okay, so picture it in your mind.

747
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:36,639
Picture the other side of the bars.

748
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,179
I'm trying. I can't.

749
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:40,719
- Now, Julia.
- I'm trying, El. I can't.

750
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,890
Come on, Jules. Now.

751
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:45,089
Oh, my God.

752
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:48,259
Eliot, I did it. It worked.

753
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,649
Yes. Okay, now do it for real.

754
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:51,279
What?

755
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,230
I'm sorry.

756
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:59,410
You motherfucker.

757
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,529
You incepted me.

758
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,079
Your baby's strong.

759
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,539
It took three castings to deceive it.

760
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,779
I had to make you believe it,

761
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,399
so we had to tell you the
spell was something else.

762
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,999
Honestly, fuck the both of you.

763
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,830
Get mad later. Use the
adrenaline right now.

764
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,949
Do it again.

765
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:16,430
- Now, Julia.
- Go to hell.

766
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:26,729
My baby is awesome.

767
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:29,190
Celebrate later, escape now.

768
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,360
- Keys.
- Right.

769
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:44,330
Alice, Kady.

770
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,470
Been expecting you.

771
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,250
Yeah.

772
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:58,830
So did you come here to watch
me play video games or what?

773
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,870
Our friend is trapped in the Underworld,

774
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,030
but he isn't dead.

775
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,650
Wow, how did he manage to do that?

776
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:08,870
Well, he's gifted at screwing up.

777
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,210
Can you please help him?

778
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:12,399
Sorry, can't.

779
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,489
Of course you can.
You run the Underworld.

780
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:16,830
I did, but then I quit.

781
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,650
You what? Can you even do that?

782
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,740
- I can do what I want.
- But why?

783
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:24,159
Our friend, he's not
supposed to be there.

784
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,990
You think death is fair?

785
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,190
You think life is fair?

786
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,730
Skip the sales pitch, Kady Orloff-Diaz.

787
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:33,660
I know your life, so I
know you know better.

788
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:36,970
Give me one reason you
deserve to be treated

789
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:40,719
any better than the rest
of us, and I'll help.

790
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,100
Otherwise, you're messing up my game.

791
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,398
What is wrong with him?

792
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,239
Why is every god we meet such a nutsack?

793
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:56,409
Look around.

794
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:58,070
What do you see?

795
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,479
A shitty apartment?

796
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,240
Shades drawn,

797
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:09,570
take-out, he's a mess.

798
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,960
Look familiar?

799
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,420
It's me after Q died.

800
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:18,930
Oh, my God.

801
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,260
Our Lady Underground was his wife.

802
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:28,400
And the monster's
sister, she killed her.

803
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,809
The God of the Dead is in mourning.

804
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,819
Let me try to talk to him.

805
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,400
Figured it out, huh?

806
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:47,210
Can you just put that down
and talk to me for a second?

807
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,800
Look.

808
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,299
There's nothing to say.

809
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,539
It's not the same, your grief and mine.

810
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,590
I disagree. I think when
you lose someone...

811
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,630
When you die,

812
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,750
you go somewhere.

813
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,809
You know how I know? 'Cause I built it.

814
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,040
For you. To help you.

815
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:13,180
Quentin? Penny?

816
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:16,110
I eased their passage.

817
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:20,900
There's no Underworld for gods.

818
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:22,699
What happens to you?

819
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,170
I don't know.

820
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:30,599
We're not supposed to die, but...

821
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,669
she did, and...

822
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:37,129
that's all I get to know.

823
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,570
Forever.

824
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,920
See, you'll die someday.

825
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,040
But I won't.

826
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,820
I'm sorry.

827
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:54,809
I wish there was something
I could say to help.

828
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:58,520
Our friend, Josh, didn't die.

829
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:00,970
He was in the Taker Realm, and...

830
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,653
Well, that's not possible.

831
00:38:02,654 --> 00:38:04,949
That place doesn't connect
to the world above.

832
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,069
Well, someone opened a door.

833
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:10,109
That's very bad.

834
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:12,619
The creatures you call Takers,
do you know what they are?

835
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,910
They're guard dogs.

836
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,630
Their realm is a security measure.

837
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,509
A barrier between your world
and the world of the dead.

838
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:24,489
If a soul tries to come
back, it takes them

839
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:26,929
and returns them to the Underworld.

840
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:27,999
Trust me.

841
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,228
The dead coming back to the living,

842
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,349
that's not a good thing.

843
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,610
So if they're in Fillory?

844
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,030
Then somebody opened a door

845
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,599
that should not have been opened.

846
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,830
And I think I know why.

847
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,778
What if it was a person
like us, who just wanted

848
00:38:41,779 --> 00:38:44,280
to bring back someone he loved?

849
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:50,750
I leave for a couple months,
and everything goes to shit.

850
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,359
I will help your friend.

851
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,790
But you will clean up this mess.

852
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,730
Stop whoever's trying
to get past the Takers.

853
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:06,130
If you don't, and let me
say this very clearly,

854
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:08,429
your world will be destroyed too.

855
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,190
Destroyed how?

856
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,930
If this person were to
get past the Takers,

857
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,139
there would be just one door

858
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:16,229
between them and the
person that they lost.

859
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:19,609
And if they were to crack that door,

860
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:22,529
who knows how many of the
dead would spill through.

861
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:25,779
Not just the one he wants,

862
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:29,310
but all the dead.

863
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,940
It could mean the end of everything.

864
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:53,140
I think we're back.

865
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:56,937
Fillory smells a lot
better than Takerville.

866
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:02,609
I didn't think you were a hugger.

867
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:04,250
Shut up.

868
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,458
Look.

869
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:25,757
Oh, my God. They're all dead.

870
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:30,310
Is that a good thing?

871
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,800
I don't know.

872
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,939
- Okay, we should stop.
- It's okay.

873
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,777
I can do this.

874
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:49,510
Okay. All right, come here.

875
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,650
He said this was eradicating your...

876
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:58,279
Timey wimey plasma factor.

877
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,739
Why does it look like
this is collecting it?

878
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,200
What? Let me see that.

879
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:06,570
Your hand is shaking.

880
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,770
I don't want this. Get this thing off.

881
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,580
What the hell is it now?
Step away from her.

882
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:16,070
This is how you unburden her curse?

883
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,379
By collecting it?

884
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:19,730
You don't understand what
you're talking about.

885
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,769
Put that down.

886
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,269
How about I smash it?

887
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:24,030
Wait.

888
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,970
- Stop. Okay.
- Your hand.

889
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,270
That tremor.

890
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:30,010
That's what happens when you run low?

891
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,819
Your finite supply?

892
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:34,420
Do you ever stop asking questions?

893
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:37,279
You're not a guardian of space-time.

894
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,810
You're a junkie.

895
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,170
I wasn't lying...

896
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,409
You used the signal to find us

897
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:44,989
so you can take what we
have to use for yourself.

898
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:47,659
I wasn't lying about what I do.

899
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,610
Time travelers are so rare.

900
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,669
But you spend your life chasing them

901
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:53,620
to unflap every butterfly wing,

902
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,549
it feels like they're everywhere.

903
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:57,910
I'm just trying to stop idiots

904
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,009
from destroying the entire universe.

905
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:02,019
Oh, it's interesting that idiots

906
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,889
include everyone except you.

907
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:06,139
Tell me most people can be trusted.

908
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:09,800
Tell me more power makes
people better. No?

909
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:12,120
I thought so.

910
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:17,990
I have been keeping this
whole thing together,

911
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,770
by myself, forever.

912
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:22,330
You didn't think you
could ask me for help?

913
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,699
Oh, I tried a few times

914
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,799
with a few of you when I was your age.

915
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,490
I believed in people.

916
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,510
You mean back before you
thought you were better

917
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,169
than everyone else?

918
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:35,050
You can't understand unless
you've seen what I have.

919
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,839
And I wouldn't wish that on the devil.

920
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,339
It's why I put you here.

921
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,719
One day, maybe you'll
know enough to thank me.

922
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:43,210
Okay, brass tacks. We're leaving.

923
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,910
- When she finishes...
- I won't.

924
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,981
She's not finishing.

925
00:42:46,982 --> 00:42:49,609
She's walking away with
whatever's in her veins

926
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:52,140
in exchange for this.

927
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:57,650
- I can't let her go if she...
- That's the deal.

928
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,081
Fine.

929
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:08,619
Learn not to time travel.

930
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,710
Because hear me.

931
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,610
If you go back, if you
change a hair on a fly,

932
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:16,279
you will be seeing me.

933
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,300
And it will be the very
last time you see anyone.

934
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:23,130
Can't wait.

935
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,400
Hey, help!

936
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:33,769
Okay, she's breathing. She's coming to.

937
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:36,060
Oh.

938
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:40,239
Yeah, uh,

939
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,820
we should probably talk.
