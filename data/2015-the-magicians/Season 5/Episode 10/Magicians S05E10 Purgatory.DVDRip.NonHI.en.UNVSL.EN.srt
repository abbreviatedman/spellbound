1
00:00:01,435 --> 00:00:02,835
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:05,811
<i>The Takers are swarming.</i>

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,284
<i>They're swarming because
Seb summoned them with a spell.</i>

4
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:11,428
<i>Okay, so, what if we locate the tree
from Seb's tattoo and chop it down?</i>

5
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:12,878
Would that sever this conduit?

6
00:00:12,913 --> 00:00:17,647
In theory, yes. He would be
mortal, and 100% stab-able.

7
00:00:21,588 --> 00:00:22,988
I wouldn't if I were you.

8
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:24,484
Surprised?

9
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:27,157
I just have a problem,
and it's getting worse.

10
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,925
Oh.

11
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,933
I traveled us to 1998.

12
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,532
<i>This is where the
signal brought us.</i>

13
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:40,368
<i>It was just a room.</i>

14
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:42,409
<i>No windows, no doors.</i>

15
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,239
We can't leave.

16
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:46,070
That's Miss Persephone.

17
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,613
<i>That's Our Lady Underground.</i>

18
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:51,074
When the Sister was in
me, I remember everything.

19
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:52,379
Promise.

20
00:00:52,486 --> 00:00:55,854
Give me the page. If the
finger's still viable, I reattach.

21
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:57,957
Hey, what happened to your eye?

22
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,926
I lent it to Josh. So I'm
keeping an eye on him, okay?

23
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:03,793
Hold up. Somebody's near Josh.

24
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,729
It's the Dark King. He's coming.

25
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:17,540
Your Highness. I
mean, Your Majesty.

26
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:19,273
I think there's been
a huge... No mistake.

27
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:21,773
You were part of the plot
to kill me, were you not?

28
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:25,209
I wouldn't say that,
exactly. It doesn't matter.

29
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:27,447
There is a way you
can make it up to me.

30
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:29,284
To Fillory.

31
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:31,187
Okay, sure. Uh, what?

32
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:37,364
You are a brave, brave man.

33
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,135
Right, thank you.

34
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:44,098
Uh... Oh.

35
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:47,733
Uh... Is this a blood
brothers kind of thing?

36
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,846
I'm guessing this
isn't a medal of valor.

37
00:01:58,185 --> 00:01:59,312
What are you doing?

38
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,287
Your death will not be in vain.

39
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:09,988
But I will miss your cooking.

40
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:11,163
What?

41
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:16,168
No. No! No, please.

42
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:21,742
Please, no! No!

43
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:23,042
No!

44
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,590
The walls are solid.

45
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:40,019
There's no buttons or switches.

46
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,455
Everything I cast is wrong here.

47
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:45,332
Circumstances are
impossible to read.

48
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:49,068
Okay, are you sure this is the
room that the signal brought you to?

49
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,536
Yes, but I can't
remember where "here" is.

50
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,333
Okay. I've still got
the Welters plaque.

51
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,774
Let's just try again.

52
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,505
It didn't work last time.

53
00:03:03,717 --> 00:03:05,481
Christ, sit.

54
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,785
The signal pulled us
back. You were right.

55
00:03:10,624 --> 00:03:13,219
That's why you should
listen to your elders, Plum.

56
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:14,350
Who the hell are you?

57
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:16,859
That was a Tiffany
lamp, you know.

58
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:20,262
Crafted from a design I acquired
from Clara Driscoll herself.

59
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,835
Took me ages to make.

60
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:24,147
Do I need to tell you how
much I don't give a shit?

61
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:26,538
Why are we here?
What do you want?

62
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,235
I want you to
stop time traveling.

63
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:33,371
Are you, like, the God
of Time or something?

64
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,678
Hardly. I'm a Time Traveler,
like young Plum here.

65
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,818
I have been monitoring you.

66
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,184
And now you're
keeping us prisoner?

67
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:44,715
"This one will be
smart," I thought.

68
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:45,884
"Cautious."

69
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:50,762
Then you had to risk altering the
future to save some young pervert.

70
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,476
So, is this the part where
you draw us little diagrams

71
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,492
about screwing up the
flow of time or whatever?

72
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:58,599
Nice thing about the 21st
century, you've all seen <i>Looper.</i>

73
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,064
So, I can get to the point.

74
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:04,506
We are here because though I
would rather be making lamps,

75
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:08,606
I am forced to focus on the
most important task there is,

76
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:12,085
protecting the
integrity of space-time,

77
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,743
which you threaten.

78
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:18,115
I'd have hoped you'd waste
your time on something useful.

79
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:19,987
Try to kill Hitler at least.

80
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,619
I was getting to it, I'm not
an asshole. I just found out.

81
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,892
Well, doing any of
those things would be a...

82
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:28,800
Would be a royal
cluster. We get it.

83
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:29,902
She gets it.

84
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,303
Yeah. She does, loud and clear.

85
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:34,397
We promise not to
change the past anymore.

86
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:35,498
Can we leave?

87
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:38,242
Well, this isn't a
"pinky swear" situation.

88
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:44,449
I know how intoxicating the
prospect of altering time can be.

89
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:49,780
Just this once, I'd like to
relieve you of that burden.

90
00:04:53,593 --> 00:04:57,121
This device
neutralizes your abilities.

91
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,128
It's painless. It's
got fucking teeth!

92
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:01,167
It's painless once it's on,

93
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:04,198
works quickly and
permanently to eradicate.

94
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:07,066
And you can still traverse
space like your peers.

95
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,933
Traveling is in our DNA.

96
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,072
What exactly would
you be eradicating?

97
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:17,148
Plum, you and I have a mutation
of the plasma factor of the blood.

98
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:20,676
Luckily, we stop producing
it by the time we can walk.

99
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:22,688
What's in you now, it's finite.

100
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,191
When we traverse time,
we use up a fraction of it.

101
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:30,688
So, you want to take away
the thing that makes me me?

102
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,329
That's dramatic.

103
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:35,092
I'm offering to rid
you of your curse.

104
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:37,097
I can't force you.

105
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:41,634
You must consent or the spell
work won't function. It's up to you.

106
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,945
I'm offering to free you.

107
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,640
Yo, this is crazy.

108
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:49,977
You have no right
to drag us both here...

109
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:51,348
I didn't.

110
00:05:51,952 --> 00:05:55,218
You, Professor, are a hanger-on.
The signal was meant for her.

111
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:56,654
I won't do it.

112
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,555
They can never just say yes.

113
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:05,227
Well, whenever you change your mind,
simply place your arm inside the cuff.

114
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:07,824
He can't help you, you
have to do it yourself.

115
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:11,195
Till then, enjoy my
space out of time.

116
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:15,164
My name is Eliphas, by
the way. Friends call me Eli.

117
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:17,437
So, Eliphas.

118
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,889
Is he just gonna leave us here?

119
00:06:45,939 --> 00:06:47,100
How do they feel?

120
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:51,472
Like ghost fingers.

121
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:55,276
They work, but magically,
they still feel severed.

122
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,017
So, you can't cast?

123
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,219
Not really, no.

124
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:04,549
One-handed, and that pretty
much rules out most spells.

125
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,918
I'm not going to
forget what you did.

126
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:11,262
We're gonna get
those pricks for this.

127
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:15,057
I don't know, Kady. Maybe
we should just walk away.

128
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:16,946
You can walk away,
but, to be clear,

129
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,804
I'm not done until I cut
that son of a bitch's balls off.

130
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:22,752
I owe them that for tying me up,

131
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,616
and I owe them triple
for what they did to you.

132
00:07:24,978 --> 00:07:26,310
You can sit it out, okay?

133
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:29,678
Um, no. We're in this together.

134
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:35,747
Oh, it's just so
beautiful, you guys.

135
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:38,952
Female friendship really is

136
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,520
the most underrated
form of love, right?

137
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:43,629
I'm sorry.

138
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:45,290
I'm extra emotional.
It's just that,

139
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:48,664
with the assassination going sideways,
and then Josh and Eliot and Julia

140
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,131
not making it back.

141
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:53,357
Not to mention all that crazy
stuff Plover told us. It's just...

142
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:55,535
It's really overwhelming.

143
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:58,245
So, um, what have
you guys been up to?

144
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:18,657
No! No, no.

145
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:38,751
Okay, okay, okay.
Josh... Josh, calm. Calm.

146
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,649
You are in...

147
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:45,325
Taker Home Base Land, I guess.

148
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:48,360
Or, never fear.

149
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:50,391
No reason to fear, because...

150
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:53,566
Taker Kryptonite,
for some reason.

151
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,600
Focus. Mission, get home.

152
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:59,001
Also, don't die.

153
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:02,169
When you were lost at
Burning Man, what did you do?

154
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:05,872
You called Margo.

155
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,687
Voldemort's clit!

156
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:17,524
Wait, where's Josh?
Where the Takers come from.

157
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,388
I don't understand.
Is it in Fillory?

158
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,222
Sure as shit
doesn't look like it.

159
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:22,790
So then, why is Josh there?

160
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,331
No clue, but seems
stuck, wandering around.

161
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,764
And it's... It's...

162
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:29,368
Stop moving the
damn camera, Josh.

163
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,971
It's like I'm
watching <i>Cloverfield.</i>

164
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,460
I really don't think my eye likes
being in a different world than me.

165
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:42,942
Is that my blood?

166
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:44,709
Oh, God. FEN: Margo.

167
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,946
Um, hey, not an expert,
but does that seem...

168
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:48,385
Real goddamn bad.

169
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:50,287
Is there a spell or something

170
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:53,189
to calm Fairy eyes
transmitting from foreign realms?

171
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,922
Even assuming yes, casting's
ultra moon-jacked today.

172
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:57,361
I can't say I'd risk it.

173
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,998
I have an idea.

174
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,136
Is she trying to do magic?

175
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,171
Mmm-hmm.

176
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,050
Should you tell her
that's a waste of time?

177
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:10,305
Should I? It seems
like it's helping.

178
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,710
Hmm?

179
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,374
Hey, a gentle reminder,

180
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:17,014
this is a magic-proof cell.

181
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,176
So...

182
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:21,783
The hedge witch
explosive arts and crafts are,

183
00:10:21,855 --> 00:10:23,016
at best, wishful thinking.

184
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,457
And you didn't think to tell
me that 45 minutes ago?

185
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:28,990
It seemed like you
needed an activity.

186
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,192
I'm honestly trying to help.

187
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,284
It's bad enough for me, and I
don't even have a human inside me.

188
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:36,098
Except you do, technically.

189
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:38,437
Shit.

190
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:40,136
Now there's nothing to do.

191
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:43,306
I really let it go on as
long as I felt morally able.

192
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,577
What are we going to do, Eliot?

193
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,837
We'll think of something?

194
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,040
Is that a question?

195
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:52,517
I am trying my best
to calm you down.

196
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:54,850
"Calm me down"? What am
I, a maiden with the vapors?

197
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,855
You're upset. I'm not upset.

198
00:10:56,956 --> 00:11:00,154
I'm locked in a dungeon during
Red fucking Monkey Month

199
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:03,162
with this baby growing
inside me like a weed on HGH

200
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:05,596
on a planet without so much
as a fucking prenatal vitamin.

201
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,531
But no, I'm not upset.
I don't get upset.

202
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:08,795
I figure it out.

203
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:12,198
There is always something.

204
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,765
Is there? Of course there is.

205
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,871
I agree. Do you?

206
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:19,237
Do you actually believe that?

207
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,472
Whew. ELIOT: Um...

208
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:22,607
Can you believe I
thought I could fix this?

209
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,542
I'm the reason we're
here in the first place.

210
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:26,978
Hey.

211
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:29,182
No... I wouldn't say that.

212
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:31,349
Face it. I failed, Eliot.

213
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,922
You didn't fail. You're just
tired, you're... you're cooped up.

214
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:39,090
I stole a quest, I got it wrong.
I screwed magic on Earth,

215
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,199
I screwed us here.

216
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:43,464
And the thing about it is, you know,
facing ever-increasing bad odds,

217
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:46,995
is that you have to be really good
at thinking of the next thing to try.

218
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:50,809
Hey, let's just, uh, take a
deep breath. Okay? We'll just...

219
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:52,597
I mean, there is nothing else.

220
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:54,172
We are done.

221
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:56,409
No. We're gonna die here.

222
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:58,576
My baby is going to die
here. We are gonna die.

223
00:11:58,718 --> 00:11:59,718
It all went to shit.

224
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:00,819
Hey.

225
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,531
You're just... You're
having a moment.

226
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,581
This is not a
moment, it's my life!

227
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:07,661
You need to calm her. She's
gonna give the baby bad humors.

228
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,925
I just heard a voice
say "bad humors."

229
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:12,258
You heard that? You heard me?

230
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,367
Can you still hear me?
Uh, this is wonderful.

231
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:16,698
Yeah. My name is Charlton.

232
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,830
What the fuck's a Charlton?

233
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:24,275
So, there's a man inside
your head and I heard him.

234
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,909
That's it, more or less.

235
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,448
An excellent summation.

236
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:31,679
Why all of a sudden could I
hear him, and then why did it stop?

237
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,277
I don't know.

238
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,614
Well, her weird
baby is developing.

239
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:42,626
My mother, who was a midwife,
once tended a lady pregnant by a nixie.

240
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:44,624
She often sleepwalked
into the sea,

241
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:47,633
but no ill befell her because
she developed gestational gills.

242
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:51,869
Charlton theorizes that
you had a psychic attack,

243
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:55,773
because of, well, who
and what the baby daddy is.

244
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,486
Wait, so you're
saying that's a thing?

245
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:00,309
Me being able to take
on what the baby can do?

246
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,175
Maybe.

247
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,344
Well, maybe this
baby's a Traveler,

248
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:08,030
I mean, that'd be pretty goddamn
handy right about now, no?

249
00:13:08,054 --> 00:13:09,054
Mmm-hmm.

250
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,946
Okay, we need to
quantify this shit.

251
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:12,677
What's happening,
how can I control it,

252
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,639
keep baby safe, and get
us the hell out of here?

253
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,787
I... I studied this first year.

254
00:13:18,097 --> 00:13:19,656
They make us take sex ed,

255
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:24,329
inter-Magician relations being
so fraught with STIs and peril.

256
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,496
I think we may have
covered this stuff.

257
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:29,072
You think, or... I'm not proud,

258
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:32,670
but I was on a record amount
of greenhouse cannabis,

259
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:35,271
and so, while technically
I heard every single word,

260
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:38,108
it was all, you know,
Sondheim lyrics.

261
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:41,114
I was there, but
in a greater sense,

262
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,387
was I there?

263
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:44,856
Well, perhaps I can help.

264
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,024
If you were, as
you say, "there,"

265
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:49,823
perhaps the
remembrance itself is...

266
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,160
Is intact in here still
somehow, that is brilliant.

267
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,164
Can you... Yeah, I
can certainly attempt.

268
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,469
My imaginary friend is on it.

269
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:58,396
Great.

270
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,576
Do's and don'ts of
magical intercourse.

271
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:07,204
I avoided real college so I
wouldn't have to see shit like this.

272
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,677
You kidding? This is
spank-bank material.

273
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,419
If it burns when you pee,

274
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:15,152
infirmary.

275
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:17,654
Red bumps like a curse,

276
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,017
see a nurse.

277
00:14:19,726 --> 00:14:21,558
Scales, feathers, fur...

278
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:24,324
Medical attention that rhymes
with fur, read you loud and clear.

279
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:27,367
Now, let's chat
procreation, shall we?

280
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:29,195
Let's start with some basics.

281
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:33,264
Do not assume that
your classmate is human

282
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,705
just because they look it.

283
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,498
Hybrids abound.

284
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,210
DNA magic develops <i>in utero,</i>

285
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,571
which can affect the
mother unpredictably,

286
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:44,708
which can, of course,
result in maiming or death.

287
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:49,545
If you think you've been
impregnated by a hybrid or creature,

288
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:51,347
you may want to take precautions

289
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:54,222
to prevent any episodes.

290
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,295
Let's go over a few, shall we?

291
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,058
Excuse me, wait,
I have questions.

292
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:02,166
Who are you? You
are not a student here.

293
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:05,728
Of course I am. I... I
did a thing to my face.

294
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,034
Hello, it's Todd.

295
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,834
Todd.

296
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,173
Yes, what's your question?

297
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,476
What if a person
wanted the episodes?

298
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:18,741
Let's say the fetus was
psychic, or even a Traveler?

299
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:20,750
I cannot speak to that.

300
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,651
Well, but you are
speaking to that.

301
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,314
This is a memory.

302
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,325
I made no mention of
Travelers specifically.

303
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:30,051
Okay, but say I
wanted my baby...

304
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:33,293
I can only tell you what's
happening in this memory, Todd,

305
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,560
and how to prevent it.

306
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:36,712
Yeah, but that won't help
me. You see, I need to know...

307
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,136
Hey, genius,

308
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:41,502
why don't you just let him tell you
how to stop it and do the opposite?

309
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:46,121
It's a defense mechanism.

310
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,665
The fetus detects the mother's
distress and reacts protectively.

311
00:15:49,816 --> 00:15:53,309
You freaked the baby out with
your meltdown, so it psyched you up.

312
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,415
Next. And this can be avoided

313
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:58,048
by cultivating a tranquil mind.
Soothing teas, meditation...

314
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,593
Can we just skip to the part
where Julia travels to safety?

315
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,288
Oh, right. Then she will need
to, aggressively, do the opposite.

316
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:05,931
The opposite of
tea and meditation?

317
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,000
Wait, is he saying I
need to freak out more?

318
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,831
She needs to feel imminent
life or death danger, yes.

319
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:15,806
Basically, we need to scare
the living shit out of you.

320
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:17,533
Great.

321
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:21,143
This is fine, totally fine.
Just a totally normal walk,

322
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,772
a totally normal forest.

323
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,526
Okay, you can't hear
that, but that is a Taker,

324
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:36,727
screaming, for some reason.

325
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,654
Whose eye is that? Uh...

326
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,463
Nobody's. It's...

327
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,465
my girlfriend's eye.

328
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,194
That's not better, you know.

329
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,264
She lent it to me.

330
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:49,301
Where did you come from?

331
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,303
How about that? So did I.

332
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,659
So, how did you
end up down here?

333
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,108
I was taken, with my friends.

334
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:59,345
Friends. Friends are good.

335
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:01,717
Uh, where are they?
The Takers put them

336
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:03,483
in a big, shiny case.

337
00:17:04,924 --> 00:17:06,119
It opens sideways,

338
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,718
and when you poke
its big yellow eye,

339
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:11,055
its mouth opens and says "Ding."

340
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:13,761
That sounds like an elevator.

341
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:14,906
Is that a kind of monster?

342
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:16,111
No, not a monster.

343
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:17,330
A machine.

344
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:18,564
That eats people?

345
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:21,334
No, it goes up, it goes down.

346
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,172
It's just weird that it's here.

347
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:25,888
Maybe we should check it
out. Do you know where...

348
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:27,032
Are you an adult? Of course.

349
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:30,212
Do I not seem like an adult?

350
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,684
Adults lie and say
everything's okay

351
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:33,829
when it really isn't.

352
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:35,515
Then Takers come.

353
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:37,084
I'm not helping an adult.

354
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,950
Oh. Please. Uh, no.

355
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:41,726
Just wait.

356
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:45,223
- No, wait. No, don't touch.
- Let me go.

357
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:47,266
No, let me go. No!

358
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,500
No! JOSH: Hey!

359
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,036
Huh? Uh...

360
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:51,263
You like this?

361
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:54,632
Yeah, shiny. Right?
Yeah, good. Go get it!

362
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:58,443
Hey, hey, hey.

363
00:17:58,544 --> 00:17:59,603
You okay? Yeah.

364
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:01,174
How did you do that? Luck.

365
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,047
Let's get the hell out of here.

366
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:06,045
That'll do it.

367
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,251
My own personal Mar-GoPro.

368
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:11,800
Trust me, where I'm
from, that was really clever.

369
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:13,190
Well, here it's stupid, okay?

370
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,260
Now, here's the
cave over there, okay?

371
00:18:16,662 --> 00:18:18,290
Okay. Looks clear.

372
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,644
Let's get a little closer
and see where it goes.

373
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,093
Come on.

374
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,811
Underworld? Do we
not want to go there?

375
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:36,815
Uh...

376
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,980
Underworld sounds
pretty good right now!

377
00:18:44,323 --> 00:18:45,814
Come on, come on!

378
00:18:50,663 --> 00:18:52,154
Not today, Takers!

379
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,602
But where are we going?

380
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,680
So this is the Underworld?

381
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,179
And it's where we
go when we die?

382
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:19,858
Does this mean we're dead?

383
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:23,060
No. No, we're
not... I... I mean,

384
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:27,198
neither of us died,
technically, so...

385
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:29,763
Are my friends dead?

386
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:32,330
Look,

387
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:34,830
I don't know.

388
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,070
And I'm not gonna
lie, this isn't good.

389
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,445
But I promise you,

390
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,449
I'm going to do whatever I can
to get us both out of here, okay?

391
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,041
You better.

392
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:51,356
Let's see if we
can find some help.

393
00:19:55,461 --> 00:19:58,226
"Welcome. You are
dead. Please take a card."

394
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,500
Take a card. You
can read, can't you?

395
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,937
Right. Uh, question.

396
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:12,676
Where do we go
if we aren't dead?

397
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:15,045
If you're here, you're dead.

398
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:17,216
And if you're dead,
you take a card.

399
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:19,514
But I'm not dead.
I can't be dead.

400
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:22,384
Please, mister. There must
be someone we can talk to.

401
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:24,128
Great. Now look what you've done.
- Oh.

402
00:20:25,658 --> 00:20:27,752
I'll see if I can find someone.

403
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,296
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. You okay?

404
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:33,494
Of course. I do
this all the time.

405
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,091
Crying makes
adults uncomfortable.

406
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:36,568
Not bad.

407
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:37,669
Hoberman?

408
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:39,937
Penny? What the fuck...

409
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,235
What are you doing here?

410
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:44,209
Uh...

411
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:51,410
Remind me why you dragged
me to the Brakebills lab

412
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:53,782
instead of staying in our
comfortable penthouse?

413
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:55,564
We had to bring you
somewhere where we could

414
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:56,788
control Circumstances.

415
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:59,289
Besides, I'm going to have to
rely on Kady to do any casting.

416
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:01,226
I don't even know
where to start.

417
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:02,420
Trash can.

418
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:04,091
What? Okay.

419
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,565
That I can handle.

420
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,574
I can see the tether
between you and your eye,

421
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,236
and it's kind of between
worlds. It's all glitchy.

422
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:22,173
I think we should sever the connection
before it does permanent damage.

423
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,577
My Fairy eye is the only
connection I have to Josh.

424
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:28,086
You cut that out, I
cut out your uterus.

425
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:29,178
Uh...

426
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,620
Margo?

427
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:32,157
Just a gentle observation.

428
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:34,858
If you scorch your brain pan,
that won't be great for Josh either.

429
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:36,356
Okay.

430
00:21:41,934 --> 00:21:43,334
Okay.

431
00:21:44,203 --> 00:21:46,843
That won't work for long. So we're
gonna need a solution yesterday.

432
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:49,071
Yeah. Okay. You stay with her.

433
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:50,939
Fen, come with me,
I'm gonna need help.

434
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:01,616
I'm gonna need to get a
couple other things, stat.

435
00:22:01,954 --> 00:22:04,150
I can only bring
authorized items.

436
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,925
Well, then ask a doctor
about premature labor

437
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:11,091
and get it authorized.

438
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:12,558
Now.

439
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:18,131
Five stalks green nightshade,

440
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:21,698
one dead quail,
unplucked, rock salt,

441
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:24,038
and two fingers of bourbon. Now.

442
00:22:24,143 --> 00:22:26,112
Ow. Ow, it really hurts.

443
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,976
Ask the King if he
wants this woman to die.

444
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:30,107
I need to cast something
to stop her pain,

445
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,550
or alternately, oceans of
blood on your hands, friend.

446
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:35,684
Chop-chop.

447
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:38,122
Hey.

448
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:39,224
Psst.

449
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:40,992
Okay, so what's
all that really for?

450
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,791
I need you scared, and
you don't scare easy.

451
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,855
So the less you
know, the better.

452
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:48,727
Gruel?

453
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:54,604
Hey, you think Ash will be fine
with, uh, what's-her-name, right?

454
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:56,506
Kathy?

455
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58,744
Old friend. She's
great with kids.

456
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:02,446
Should feel like
recess plus birthday.

457
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:04,980
It's just, me and the
kid kind of have this

458
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:08,982
Newt-and-Ripley thing going.
I promised I'd get her home.

459
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,790
Then I should get the
bad news out of the way.

460
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,260
I can't help you.

461
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:16,586
Why the hell not?

462
00:23:16,695 --> 00:23:18,254
Take a look around.

463
00:23:18,364 --> 00:23:20,424
Librarians have been going
through some shit lately.

464
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:23,559
No magic. Too much
magic, but unpredictable.

465
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:26,697
A lot of our folks got
relocated, and we...

466
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,039
kind of, don't
exactly know where.

467
00:23:30,376 --> 00:23:35,178
Okay, perfect world, boss
steps in, oversees shit, but...

468
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,750
Hades has vanished.

469
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,320
Your boss is the god Hades?

470
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:44,081
That's cool.

471
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,582
Except for the
abandoning you part.

472
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:48,225
Can't say that's great.

473
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:50,452
Kind of a skeleton crew.

474
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:52,929
And here's the bad news for you.

475
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,825
Our connection to the world of
the living, Hades controls that.

476
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:58,928
And right before he
FO'd, he flipped the switch.

477
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:00,263
Why?

478
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:06,040
Man, dead you is
just way more zen.

479
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:09,306
Uh, so after all that,
why did you stay?

480
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,081
I make a promise, I keep it.

481
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,852
Look, bro, I hear
you, and bad timing,

482
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,923
but me and the
kid, we didn't die.

483
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:19,823
We just got dragged into a
weird netherworld by the Takers.

484
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:21,223
Right, you said.

485
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:23,118
Never heard of 'em.

486
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:25,322
Well, I promise you,
they're real and they suck,

487
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:27,400
and we are in the wrong place.

488
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,692
I mean, this can't be
the first time in history

489
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,328
not-dead people
ended up here, right?

490
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:34,964
Accidents happen. There's
gotta be some protocol.

491
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,833
Or some special
dispensation thing.

492
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:42,104
Anyone sent to the Underworld by
mistake has 24 hours to file a dispute.

493
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:44,082
Great! Let's file a dispute.

494
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,983
Disputes have to be sent up top.

495
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:50,013
And since Hades left, we can't.

496
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:54,425
So, if we don't find
Hades, we're just stuck?

497
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:55,786
I'm sorry.

498
00:24:56,028 --> 00:25:00,329
Does he have, like,
a pager or a walkie?

499
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:02,463
If he doesn't want to
be found, he won't be.

500
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,300
Underworld is big.

501
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:06,297
He could be anywhere.

502
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:09,536
Well, could I maybe get a map
and start checking things off?

503
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:12,834
Shit.

504
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:17,814
I might know
someone who can help.

505
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:21,385
God, but it is the suck option.

506
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,653
Penny! You got my invite.

507
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,194
Uh...

508
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:31,462
Oh.

509
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:33,760
You need something. Sorry, man.

510
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,035
This is so typical.

511
00:25:37,136 --> 00:25:39,230
You don't come to my
brunches, which I guess is fine,

512
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:40,738
but you could at least RSVP.

513
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:44,068
That is the polite thing to do,

514
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:46,145
so he doesn't
have too much food.

515
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:50,409
That makes sense.

516
00:25:50,783 --> 00:25:53,184
Anyway, we need an expert.

517
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:54,413
That is why we're here,

518
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,957
and I gather you are the guy
who knows where everything is.

519
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:01,358
Well, I do know a thing or two.

520
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,594
And I am very generous with
my time, unlike some people.

521
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,965
We are looking for Hades.

522
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,762
Penny thinks you
might know where he is.

523
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,096
I have no idea.

524
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:13,032
Penny told you he
disappeared, right? Very odd.

525
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:15,852
Usually there's at least one
person that can get a hold of him.

526
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,510
This time... But you
know all his spots?

527
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,443
Gods, no.

528
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:24,079
Quite the opposite. He
is insanely strict on me.

529
00:26:24,183 --> 00:26:26,516
You know, I'm not even allowed
to map the place where he...

530
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,087
Wait a minute.

531
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,450
He forbade me from mapping
an area in the Underworld.

532
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,955
I always suspected he had
some kind of special retreat there.

533
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:41,830
I'm sorry, if it's not on the map,
what good would that do us?

534
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,903
Well, because I mapped
everything else around it.

535
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:48,373
So, in an ironic way, it's
like I mapped it perfectly.

536
00:26:57,249 --> 00:26:59,480
Is it time to put another
scratch mark up?

537
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:02,378
It's been a day, right?

538
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,722
I can't tell anymore.

539
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,022
I think your count is short.

540
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:10,552
We've been here
longer than a month.

541
00:27:11,497 --> 00:27:14,865
This whole conversation is
predicated on time having meaning,

542
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:17,960
which it doesn't in here, so...

543
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:23,733
A Time Traveler walks
into a bar in Vienna, 1908.

544
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:28,740
Sits next to a young art
student named Adolf Hitler.

545
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:31,982
Adolf sighs into his beer.

546
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:34,348
"You know what I hate?" he asks.

547
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:39,422
Time Traveler says,
"I don't know. Jews?"

548
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:44,029
And Hitler goes, "Huh.
Now that you mention it..."

549
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:47,760
I mean, you gotta laugh, right?

550
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:48,994
You're right.

551
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:51,069
There are no good
jokes about time-traveling.

552
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:52,901
At first I thought
it was better,

553
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:56,533
at least, that we don't get
hungry or tired or need to pee,

554
00:27:56,642 --> 00:27:57,769
but it's just...

555
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:59,539
Fucking torture.

556
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:03,047
The sameness, it is intolerable.

557
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:05,208
Hey. Hey, hey.

558
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:07,616
We are tolerating fine.

559
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,878
Hey, we are going
to figure this out.

560
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:12,147
There is nothing to figure out.

561
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,725
It is what it is.

562
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:18,925
There is just one decision.

563
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,728
I'd still be a regular Traveler.

564
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,325
No, that's not happening.

565
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:25,695
This is it, Penny.

566
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:29,639
The... The Chatwin curse.
The tipping of the scale.

567
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,872
No, this is just some self-important
asshole we need to outsmart.

568
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:36,024
I am not letting you be forced into
a decision that's gonna ruin your life.

569
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,744
It's not my life,
exactly. It's...

570
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:39,578
You don't know what it is.

571
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:41,643
You are at the beginning.

572
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:43,647
That's why, no.

573
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,358
We could be here forever

574
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:50,027
if we don't do something.

575
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:55,964
What are you doing?
I'm making my decision.

576
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:32,570
Wow.

577
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:36,575
The Underworld is in shambles,
and Hades is out here doing...

578
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:40,140
Whatever this is.

579
00:29:41,046 --> 00:29:42,480
Pink Himalayan sea salt.

580
00:29:42,648 --> 00:29:45,914
I do a great salt-crusted
cod with a lovely...

581
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:48,129
You know what, never
mind. Not important.

582
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:50,520
He uses it as a spa
bath. It extracts toxins.

583
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:51,988
A great stress releaser.

584
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,050
So I've heard. MAN: Excuse me.

585
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:55,791
This temple is off-limits.

586
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:57,760
Yes, hi. We are
looking for Hades.

587
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,195
He's unavailable.

588
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:02,160
Respectfully, we wouldn't
come here if it wasn't urgent.

589
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:04,532
Can you please let him
know that we are here?

590
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,204
No. He's gone.

591
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,535
Well, he can't just be gone.

592
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,474
I assume you're here
because he just up and left

593
00:30:12,077 --> 00:30:13,670
and you're worried
it was for good.

594
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:15,213
Well, I'm sorry to tell you,

595
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,374
when he left, he told me
he might never be back.

596
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:18,910
Wait, what? Never?

597
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:20,847
He didn't feel like elaborating.

598
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:23,531
It's just, some of us are trying
to keep the Underworld running.

599
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,956
Yeah, and some of
us are trying to map it!

600
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:27,649
And he is a god.

601
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,760
He doesn't answer to any of you.

602
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:31,562
Well, excuse me,
please... Um, guys.

603
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,493
I think I got something.

604
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,035
Let's just hope
Margo's still watching.

605
00:30:39,705 --> 00:30:41,037
So, here's the plan.

606
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:44,038
We separate the signal
before it enters Margo's brain,

607
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:45,235
and then we deflect it.

608
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,472
Like, put it
somewhere else? How?

609
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,809
With this.

610
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:52,646
Now, I have a mixed
history with prism spells,

611
00:30:52,718 --> 00:30:54,812
so you're gonna need
to check my math.

612
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:57,549
This feels weird as fuck.

613
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,322
Just don't move.

614
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:03,152
Did you... Did you
poke her brain parts?

615
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,126
How does that feel?

616
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:08,724
Like you just stuck a flash
drive into my Jell-O hole.

617
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:16,608
Oh, my God. I feel something
coming through. What the fuck?

618
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:19,804
Oh, Channel Josh is live!

619
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:22,446
How does it feel?

620
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,516
Like I'm getting
acupuncture inside my brain.

621
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:25,676
But it doesn't hurt.

622
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:28,217
Oh, thank God he's alive.

623
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:30,278
Except where the
shit-faced Jesus is he?

624
00:31:31,923 --> 00:31:34,586
Wait, why is Penny
in Taker Land?

625
00:31:35,093 --> 00:31:37,028
That's not... That's
not the Penny...

626
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:39,223
That's... That's Penny.
That's my Penny.

627
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:41,743
Wait, but that would mean
that Josh is in the Underworld.

628
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:43,201
No, no, no. That would mean...

629
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:45,396
Josh is dead?

630
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:48,831
Wait. He's trying to
tell us that he's still alive

631
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:50,840
and needs our help.

632
00:31:53,011 --> 00:31:55,276
But I don't get... Isn't
Hades down there?

633
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,747
I am so confused.

634
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:02,077
An address! In Queens!

635
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:03,953
Hades is on Earth?

636
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:05,956
Well, shit. Go
check. I'd come with,

637
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:09,391
but I've got a goddamn movie
projector stuck in my eye hole.

638
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:11,052
Okay.

639
00:32:11,229 --> 00:32:14,290
Now, arrange the feathers
in front of you in a triangle

640
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:17,098
and then drink this.

641
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:19,463
What's the bourbon
for? It's for me.

642
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:25,801
Ugh.

643
00:32:26,211 --> 00:32:30,842
Okay, so, um, this isn't going to do
anything to you or mini-you, physically.

644
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:35,110
But, um, you will feel a
huge shot of fear and anxiety,

645
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,745
and it's not gonna be nice,

646
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:38,450
so, hopefully,
that'll do something.

647
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:40,386
Okay, bottoms up.

648
00:32:40,926 --> 00:32:44,920
Now, listen to, uh, exactly
what I'm going to say

649
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:47,056
because the next
part can get a little bit...

650
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:48,265
Um...

651
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:51,630
Weird.

652
00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:56,307
Okay, on my count. Three, two...

653
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:02,414
Oh, my God. My water just broke.

654
00:33:02,781 --> 00:33:04,181
What? That's very bad.

655
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:05,722
Oh, my God. The
baby's coming, Eliot.

656
00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:07,150
Uh, tell her to lay on her back.

657
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:10,288
I can't lay on my back,
it's coming. It's too soon.

658
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:12,133
This is way too soon.
Eliot, please do something.

659
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,648
You have to get a guard. Guard!

660
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:15,536
They won't come. They
never come between meals.

661
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,960
Oh, shit. I'm sorry, there...

662
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:19,463
Eliot, you have to get
us out of here. I can't.

663
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:21,329
Tell the baby. What? Okay.

664
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,267
Okay, baby, we gotta go.
We gotta go, okay, baby?

665
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:26,202
We gotta go. Oh, we gotta go.

666
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:27,863
Okay, how does Penny travel?

667
00:33:27,973 --> 00:33:30,499
He... He pictures
it in his mind, right?

668
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:31,702
Right. ELIOT: Right? Okay,

669
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:34,473
so picture it in your mind,
picture the other side of the bars.

670
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:36,014
I'm trying, I can't.

671
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:38,743
Now, Julia. I'm
trying, El, I can't.

672
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,011
Come on, Jules. Now.

673
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:42,886
Oh, my God.

674
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,651
Eliot, I did it. It worked. Yes.

675
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:48,751
Okay, now do it for real. What?

676
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:51,457
I'm sorry.

677
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:58,328
You motherfucker.
You incepted me.

678
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:01,699
Your baby's strong, took
three castings to deceive it.

679
00:34:01,773 --> 00:34:04,285
I had to make you believe it, so we had
to tell you the spell was something else.

680
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:06,210
Honestly, fuck the both of you.

681
00:34:06,311 --> 00:34:08,576
Get mad later. Use
the adrenalin right now.

682
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:11,308
Do it again.

683
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:13,885
Now, Julia. Go to hell.

684
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:23,628
My baby is awesome.

685
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,597
Celebrate later,
escape now. Keys.

686
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,029
Right.

687
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:43,613
Alice, Kady.

688
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:45,807
Been expecting you.

689
00:34:48,053 --> 00:34:49,077
Here.

690
00:34:53,992 --> 00:34:57,520
So, did you come here to watch
me play video games, or what?

691
00:34:58,363 --> 00:35:01,299
Our friend is trapped in the
Underworld, but he isn't dead.

692
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:02,399
Wow.

693
00:35:02,601 --> 00:35:03,967
How'd he manage to do that?

694
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:06,766
Well, he's, uh,
gifted at screwing up.

695
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:09,634
Can you please help him?

696
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:11,767
Sorry, can't.

697
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:14,070
'Course you can, you
run the Underworld.

698
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:15,975
I did, but then I quit.

699
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:18,007
You what? Can you even do that?

700
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,108
I can do what I want. But why?

701
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:23,551
Our friend, he's not
supposed to be there.

702
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,420
You think death is fair?

703
00:35:25,991 --> 00:35:27,653
You think life is fair?

704
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:30,126
Skip the sales pitch,
Kady Orloff-Diaz.

705
00:35:30,195 --> 00:35:32,460
I know your life, so I
know you know better.

706
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:37,463
Give me one reason you deserve to
be treated any better than the rest of us,

707
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:38,867
and I'll help.

708
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:42,403
Otherwise, you're
messing up my game.

709
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:48,678
What is wrong with him?

710
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,649
Why is every god we
meet such a nutsack?

711
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:54,885
Look around.

712
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:57,150
What do you see?

713
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:02,884
A shitty apartment.

714
00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:07,790
Shades drawn,
takeout, he's a mess.

715
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:10,334
Look familiar?

716
00:36:13,605 --> 00:36:14,698
It's me, after Q died.

717
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:18,335
Oh, my God.

718
00:36:21,246 --> 00:36:23,977
Our Lady Underground
was his wife.

719
00:36:24,983 --> 00:36:27,145
The Monster's
sister, she killed her.

720
00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:31,148
The God of the
Dead is in mourning.

721
00:36:34,459 --> 00:36:36,257
Let me try to talk to him.

722
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:42,831
Um... Figured it out, huh?

723
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:46,532
Can you just put that down
and talk to me for a second?

724
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:54,235
Look,

725
00:36:56,681 --> 00:36:59,913
there's nothing to say. It's not
the same, your grief and mine.

726
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:01,850
I disagree.

727
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,030
I think when you lose someone...

728
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:05,489
When you die, you go somewhere.

729
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,193
You know how I
know? Because I built it.

730
00:37:08,493 --> 00:37:10,121
For you. To help you.

731
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:12,288
Quentin? Penny?

732
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:15,291
I eased their passage.

733
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:19,766
There's no Underworld for gods.

734
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,067
What happens to you?

735
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,266
I don't know.

736
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:28,706
We're not supposed to die,

737
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,076
but she did,

738
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:37,312
and that's all I get
to know, forever.

739
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:41,152
See, you'll die someday,

740
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:43,427
but I won't.

741
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:49,598
I'm sorry.

742
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:54,235
I wish there was something
I could say to help.

743
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,799
But our friend,
Josh, didn't die.

744
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,405
He was in the Taker Realm and...

745
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:01,969
That's not possible.

746
00:38:02,714 --> 00:38:04,514
That place doesn't
connect to the world above.

747
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:06,445
Well, someone opened a door.

748
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:08,510
That's very bad.

749
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:12,055
The creatures you call Takers,
do you know what they are?

750
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:14,091
Uh...

751
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:16,128
They're guard dogs.

752
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:17,986
Their realm is a
security measure.

753
00:38:18,096 --> 00:38:20,895
A barrier between your world
and the World of the Dead.

754
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:22,590
If a soul tries to come back,

755
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:26,069
it takes them and returns
them to the Underworld.

756
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:27,337
Trust me.

757
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:29,798
The dead coming back to the
living, that's not a good thing.

758
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:31,739
So, if they're in Fillory...

759
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,912
Then somebody opened a door
that should not have been opened.

760
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,138
I think I know why.

761
00:38:38,283 --> 00:38:39,774
What if it was a person like us

762
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:43,618
who just wanted to bring
back someone he loved?

763
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,124
I leave for a couple of months,
and everything goes to shit.

764
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:56,566
I will help your friend.

765
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:58,660
But you will clean up this mess.

766
00:38:59,404 --> 00:39:02,101
Stop whoever's trying
to get past the Takers.

767
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,642
If you don't, and let
me say this very clearly,

768
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,838
your world will
be destroyed, too.

769
00:39:08,313 --> 00:39:09,542
Destroyed how?

770
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:12,116
If this person were
to get past the Takers,

771
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,550
there would be just one door between
them and the person that they lost.

772
00:39:15,987 --> 00:39:18,354
And if they were
to crack that door,

773
00:39:19,257 --> 00:39:21,852
who knows how many of
the dead would spill through.

774
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,862
Not just the one he wants,

775
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,328
but all the dead.

776
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,862
It could mean the
end of everything.

777
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:52,448
I... I think we're back.

778
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:56,388
Fillory smells a lot
better than Takerville.

779
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:04,035
I didn't think you were
a hugger. Shut up.

780
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,403
Mmm.

781
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,542
Look.

782
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:25,557
Oh, my God. They're all dead.

783
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,920
Is that a good thing?

784
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:32,195
I don't know.

785
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,235
Okay, we should stop.

786
00:40:43,308 --> 00:40:45,277
It's okay, I can do this.

787
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:49,373
Okay. All right, come on.

788
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:55,498
He said this was
eradicating your...

789
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:58,317
Timey-wimey plasma factor.

790
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,101
Why does it look like
this is collecting it?

791
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,286
What? Let me see that.

792
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:06,657
Your hand is shaking.

793
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:08,684
I don't... I don't want
this. Get this thing off.

794
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:12,527
What the hell is it now?
Step away from her.

795
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:15,173
This is how you
unburden her curse?

796
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,474
By collecting it?

797
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:19,782
You don't understand
what you're talking about.

798
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:20,835
Put that down.

799
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:23,304
How about I smash it? Wait!

800
00:41:24,549 --> 00:41:26,108
Stop, okay? Your hand,

801
00:41:26,351 --> 00:41:27,351
that tremor.

802
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,881
That's what happens when
you run low? Your finite supply?

803
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:34,515
Do you ever stop
asking questions?

804
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:37,424
You're not a guardian
of space-time,

805
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:40,329
you're a junkie. I wasn't lying.

806
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:44,835
You used the signal to find us so you
can take what we have to use for yourself.

807
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:47,098
I wasn't lying about what I do.

808
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:49,838
Time Travelers are so rare,

809
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:53,667
but you spend your life chasing
them to unflap every butterfly wing,

810
00:41:53,745 --> 00:41:55,646
it feels like they're
everywhere.

811
00:41:56,047 --> 00:42:00,109
I'm just trying to stop idiots from
destroying the entire universe.

812
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:03,985
Oh, it's interesting that idiots
include everyone except you.

813
00:42:04,589 --> 00:42:06,182
Tell me most people
can be trusted.

814
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:09,855
Tell me more power
makes people better. No?

815
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:11,919
I thought so.

816
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:19,994
I have been keeping this whole
thing together, by myself, forever.

817
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:22,466
You didn't think you
could ask me for help?

818
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:26,136
Oh, I tried a few times with a
few of you when I was your age.

819
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,607
I believed in people.

820
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:32,150
You mean back before you thought
you were better than everyone else?

821
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:35,084
You can't understand unless
you've seen what I have,

822
00:42:35,186 --> 00:42:36,882
and I wouldn't wish
that on the devil.

823
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:39,380
It's why I put you here.

824
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,902
One day maybe you'll
know enough to thank me.

825
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:43,588
Okay, brass tacks,
we're leaving.

826
00:42:43,795 --> 00:42:45,923
When she finishes, I... I won't.

827
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,225
She's not finishing.

828
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:49,694
She's walking away with
whatever's in her veins

829
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:52,096
in exchange for this.

830
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:57,501
I can't let her go if
she... That's the deal.

831
00:43:02,213 --> 00:43:03,213
Fine.

832
00:43:07,385 --> 00:43:08,819
Learn not to Time Travel.

833
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:13,749
Because, hear me, if you go
back, if you change a hair on a fly,

834
00:43:13,825 --> 00:43:15,657
you will be seeing me,

835
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:19,424
and it will be the very
last time you see anyone.

836
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:23,125
Can't wait.

837
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:28,762
Hey, help!

838
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:33,944
Okay, she's breathing.
She's coming to.

839
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:35,645
Um...

840
00:43:38,483 --> 00:43:39,542
Yeah, uh,

841
00:43:40,485 --> 00:43:42,920
we should probably talk.
