1
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:08,861
‐ Previously on
"The Magicians"...

2
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,012
‐ The Takers are swarming.

3
00:00:12,045 --> 00:00:14,090
‐ They're swarming because Seb
summoned them with a spell.

4
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:15,892
‐ Okay, so what if we locate
the tree from Seb's tattoo

5
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:17,484
and chop it down?

6
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:18,595
Would that sever this conduit?

7
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:20,354
‐ In theory, yes.

8
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:23,624
He would be mortal
and 100% stab‐able.

9
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:25,259
‐

10
00:00:27,194 --> 00:00:28,695
I wouldn't if I were you.

11
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:30,297
Surprised?

12
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,133
‐ I just have a problem,
and it's getting worse.

13
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:36,970
‐ Whoa.
‐

14
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:39,706
I traveled us to 1998.

15
00:00:41,975 --> 00:00:44,378
This is where
the signal brought us.

16
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:46,113
It was just a room.

17
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:48,282
No windows,
no doors.

18
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:50,150
We can't leave.

19
00:00:50,183 --> 00:00:51,685
‐ That's Ms. Persephone.

20
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,387
‐ That's Our Lady Underground.

21
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,122
‐
‐ When the sister was in me,

22
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:57,024
I remember everything.

23
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,326
‐ Promise.
Give me the page.

24
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,296
If the finger's still viable,
I reattach.

25
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:03,506
‐ Hey, what happened
to your eye?

26
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,364
‐ I lent it to Josh.

27
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,667
I'm keeping
an eye on him, okay?

28
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,168
Hold up.

29
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:09,636
Somebody's near Josh.

30
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:11,772
It's the Dark King.
He's coming.

31
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:20,414
‐

32
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:21,548
Your Highness.

33
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,350
I mean, Your Majesty.

34
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:25,252
I think there's been a huge‐‐
‐ No mistake.

35
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:27,554
You were part of the plot
to kill me, were you not?

36
00:01:27,588 --> 00:01:31,091
‐ I wouldn't say that exactly.
‐ It doesn't matter.

37
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:33,260
There is a way you can
make it up to me.

38
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:34,561
To Fillory.

39
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:37,564
‐ Okay, sure.
Uh, what?

40
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:40,100
‐ Down.
‐

41
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:43,236
‐ You are a brave, brave man.

42
00:01:45,339 --> 00:01:48,709
‐ Right.
Thank you.

43
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:52,312
‐ Uh‐‐oh,
is this a blood brothers

44
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:54,181
kind of thing?

45
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:56,516
‐

46
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,586
‐ I'm guessing this isn't
a medal of valor.

47
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,724
‐

48
00:02:03,757 --> 00:02:07,694
- ‐ What are you doing?
- ‐.

49
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:13,300
Your death will not be in vain.

50
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,502
But I will miss your cooking.

51
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:16,637
‐ What?

52
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,209
‐ No. No.
No, no, please.

53
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:25,512
Please, please.

54
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:27,381
No, no, no.

55
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:29,216
No.

56
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,397
‐ The walls are solid.

57
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,799
There's no buttons or switches.

58
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,235
‐ Everything I cast
is wrong here.

59
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:51,304
Circumstances are
impossible to read.

60
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,739
Okay, are you sure

61
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,741
this is the room that
the signal brought you to?

62
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:57,678
‐ Yes, but I can't remember
where here is.

63
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,312
Oh, good.

64
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:00,456
I've still got
the welter's plaque.

65
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,249
Let's just try again.

66
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:04,384
‐ It didn't work last time.

67
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:08,789
‐

68
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:11,324
‐ Come, come.
Sit, sit, sit, sit.

69
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,660
‐ The signal pulled us back.
You were right.

70
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:19,166
‐ That's why you should listen
to your elders, Plum.

71
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,033
‐ Who the hell are you?

72
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:22,769
‐ That was a Tiffany lamp,
you know.

73
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:24,671
Crafted from a design
I acquired

74
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,507
from Clara Driscoll herself.
It took me ages to make.

75
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:29,810
‐ Do I need to tell you
how much I don't give a shit?

76
00:03:29,843 --> 00:03:32,312
‐ Why are we here?
What do you want?

77
00:03:32,345 --> 00:03:35,182
‐ I want you to stop
time traveling.

78
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:38,285
‐ Are you, like,
the God of Time

79
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:39,419
or something?
‐ Hardly.

80
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:42,422
I'm a time traveler
like young Plum here.

81
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:44,191
I have been monitoring you.

82
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,294
‐ And now you're
keeping us prisoner?

83
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:50,363
‐ This one will be smart,
I thought.

84
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:52,499
Cautious.

85
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,501
Then you had to risk
altering the future

86
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:57,204
to save some young pervert.

87
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,215
‐ So is this the part where
you draw us little diagrams

88
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,341
about screwing up the flow
of time or whatever?

89
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:02,909
‐ Nice thing about
the 21st century.

90
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:04,478
You've all seen "Looper."

91
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:07,147
So I can get to the point.

92
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,317
We are here because though
I would rather be making lamps,

93
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:14,421
I am forced to focus on the
most important task there is,

94
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:18,225
protecting the integrity
of space‐time.

95
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,694
Which you threaten.

96
00:04:20,727 --> 00:04:23,864
I'd have hoped you'd waste
your time on something useful.

97
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:25,766
Try to kill Hitler at least.

98
00:04:25,799 --> 00:04:27,200
‐ I was getting to it.

99
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:29,402
I'm not an asshole.
I just found out.

100
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,705
‐ Well, doing any
of those things would be‐‐

101
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:33,440
‐ Would be a royal cluster.

102
00:04:33,473 --> 00:04:35,842
We get it.
She gets it.

103
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:37,744
‐ Yeah, she does
loud and clear.

104
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:40,280
We promise not to change
the past anymore.

105
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:41,181
Can we leave?

106
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:45,285
‐ Well, this isn't
a pinky‐swear situation.

107
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:47,687
I know how intoxicating

108
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:51,424
the prospect
of altering time can be.

109
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,292
"Just this once."

110
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:55,562
I'd like to relieve you
of that burden.

111
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:02,903
This device neutralizes
your abilities.

112
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:04,871
It's painless‐‐
‐ It's got fucking teeth.

113
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:07,040
‐ It's painless once it's on.

114
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:09,910
Works quickly
and permanently to eradicate.

115
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:12,813
And you can still traverse
space like your peers.

116
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:14,981
‐ Traveling is in our DNA.

117
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:17,784
What exactly would
you be eradicating?

118
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:19,386
‐ Plum, you and I

119
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:22,756
have a mutation of
the plasma factor of the blood.

120
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:26,493
Luckily, we stop producing it
by the time we can walk.

121
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,762
What's in you now,
it's finite.

122
00:05:28,795 --> 00:05:31,998
When we traverse time,
we use up a fraction of it.

123
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:36,570
‐ So you want to take away
the thing that makes me, me?

124
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:38,305
‐ That's dramatic.

125
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,807
I'm offering to rid you
of your curse.

126
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,843
I can't force you.

127
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:46,446
You must consent or
the spell work won't function.

128
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,315
It's up to you.

129
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:51,685
I'm offering to free you.

130
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:53,620
‐ No, this is crazy.

131
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,789
You have no right
to drag us both here‐‐

132
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,424
‐ I didn't.

133
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:59,259
You, Professor,
are a hanger‐on.

134
00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:00,961
The signal was meant for her.

135
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,462
‐ I won't do it.

136
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,531
‐ Oh, they can never
just say yes.

137
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:08,568
Well, whenever
you change your mind,

138
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:11,004
simply place your arm
inside the cuff.

139
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,773
He can't help you.
You have to do it yourself.

140
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:17,444
Till then, enjoy
my space out of time.

141
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:19,446
My name is Eliphas,
by the way.

142
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:20,780
Friends call me Eli.

143
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:23,450
So Eliphas.

144
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,694
‐ Is he just gonna
leave us here?

145
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,013
‐ How do they feel?

146
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:57,651
‐ Like ghost fingers.

147
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:01,321
They work, but magically,
they still feel severed.

148
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,990
‐ So you can't cast?

149
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:05,992
‐ Not really, no.

150
00:07:06,026 --> 00:07:08,061
One‐handed

151
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,463
and that pretty much
rules out most spells.

152
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:14,134
‐ I'm not gonna forget
what you did.

153
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:17,070
We're gonna get
those pricks for this.

154
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,874
‐ I don't know, Kady.
Maybe we should just walk away.

155
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,676
‐ You can walk away,
but to be clear,

156
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:25,445
I'm not done until I cut that
son of a bitch's balls off.

157
00:07:25,478 --> 00:07:26,947
‐

158
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,515
‐ I owe them that
for tying me up,

159
00:07:28,548 --> 00:07:30,517
and I owe them triple
for what they did to you.

160
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,552
You can sit it out, okay?

161
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:35,722
‐ Um, no.
We're in this together.

162
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:38,959
‐

163
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:42,429
Oh, it's just
so beautiful, you guys.

164
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,764
Female friendship really is

165
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,867
the most underrated
form of love, right?

166
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:50,537
I'm sorry.
I'm extra emotional.

167
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,706
I just‐‐the assassination
going sideways,

168
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:55,875
and then Josh and Eliot
and Julia not making it back.

169
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,545
Not to mention all that
crazy stuff Plover told us.

170
00:07:58,578 --> 00:07:59,479
It's just...

171
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,448
It's really overwhelming.

172
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,017
So, um, what have you guys
been up to?

173
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:16,730
‐

174
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:21,034
‐

175
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:24,771
‐ No, no.
No, no.

176
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,711
‐

177
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:34,113
‐

178
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,089
Okay, okay, okay.

179
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:45,925
Josh, Josh,
calm, calm.

180
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,594
You are in...

181
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:53,099
Taker Home Base Land,
I guess? Or...

182
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,235
never fear.
No reason to fear

183
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:59,205
because Taker Kryptonite
for some reason.

184
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,208
Focus.
Mission, get home.

185
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:04,811
Also don't die.

186
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,880
When you were lost
at "Burning Man,"

187
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:09,849
what did you do?
You...

188
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,684
called Margo.

189
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,057
‐

190
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:20,693
Voldemort's clit.

191
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,196
‐ Wait, where's Josh?
‐ Where the Takers come from.

192
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,031
‐ I don't understand.
Is it in Fillory?

193
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,966
‐ Sure as shit
doesn't look like it.

194
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,535
‐ So then why is Josh there?

195
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,137
‐ No clue, but seems stuck,
wandering around.

196
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:32,539
And it's, it's...

197
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,642
Stop moving
the damn camera, Josh.

198
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,844
It's like I'm watching
"Cloverfield."

199
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,547
I really don't think my eye

200
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,180
likes being in a different
world than me.

201
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:48,855
Is that my blood?

202
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,623
‐ Oh, God.
‐ Margo.

203
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,826
Um, hey, not an expert,
but does that seem‐‐

204
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:54,160
‐ Real goddamn bad.

205
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:55,628
‐ Is there a spell
or something

206
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:58,998
to calm fairy eyes transmitting
from foreign realms?

207
00:09:59,032 --> 00:09:59,899
‐ Even assuming yes,

208
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,801
casting's ultra
moon‐jacked today.

209
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:02,869
I can't say I'd risk it.

210
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,170
‐

211
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:06,706
‐ I have an idea.

212
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,711
‐ Is she trying to do magic?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

213
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,746
‐ Should you tell her
that's a waste of time?

214
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,082
‐ Should I?
It seems like it's helping.

215
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,251
‐ Hmm?

216
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,487
‐ Hey, uh, a gentle reminder:

217
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,190
This is a magic‐proof cell,
so...

218
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:27,293
the hedge‐witch‐explosive
arts and crafts

219
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:28,962
are at best
wishful thinking.

220
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:32,198
‐ And you didn't think
to tell me that 45 minutes ago?

221
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:34,868
‐ It seemed like
you needed an activity.

222
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,936
I'm honestly trying to help.

223
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:37,837
It's bad enough for me,

224
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:39,772
and I don't even have
a human inside me.

225
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,709
‐ Except you do, technically.

226
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,043
‐ Shit.

227
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:46,045
Now there's nothing to do.

228
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,082
‐ I really let it go on
as long as I felt morally able.

229
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,117
‐ What are we going
to do, Eliot?

230
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,720
‐ We'll think of something?

231
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:54,888
‐ Is that a question?

232
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:58,224
‐ I am trying my best
to calm you down‐‐

233
00:10:58,258 --> 00:10:59,292
‐ Calm me down?

234
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,760
What am I,
a maiden with the vapors?

235
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:02,629
‐ You're upset‐‐
‐ I'm not upset.

236
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,832
I'm locked in a dungeon during
Red fucking Monkey month

237
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,801
with this baby growing
inside me like a weed on HGH,

238
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,237
on a planet without so much
as a fucking prenatal vitamin.

239
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,139
But no, I'm not upset.
I don't get upset.

240
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,173
I figure it out.

241
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,244
There is always something.

242
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:20,747
‐ Is there?
‐ Of course there is.

243
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,949
I agree.
‐ Do you?

244
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:24,884
Do you actually believe that?

245
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:26,619
‐
‐ Um...

246
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:28,164
‐ I can't believe
I thought I could fix this.

247
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:31,324
I'm the reason we're here
in the first place.

248
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,960
‐ Hey.
‐ No.

249
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:37,130
‐ I wouldn't say that‐‐
‐ Face it, I failed, Eliot.

250
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,731
‐

251
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:40,767
You didn't fail,
you're just tired.

252
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,568
You're cooped up‐‐

253
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:42,811
‐ I stole a quest,
I got it wrong.

254
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:45,872
I screwed magic on Earth,
I screwed us here.

255
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,340
And the thing about it is,
you know,

256
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,209
facing ever increasing bad odds

257
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:50,452
is that you have to be
really good

258
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,845
at thinking
of the next thing to try.

259
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,982
‐ Hey, let's just
take a deep breath, okay?

260
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,050
We'll just‐‐

261
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,294
‐ I mean,
there is nothing else.

262
00:11:58,318 --> 00:11:59,953
We are done.

263
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:02,155
‐ No.
‐ We're gonna die here.

264
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,290
My baby is going to die here.
We are gonna die.

265
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,826
And it all went to shit.
‐ Hey, hey, hey.

266
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,204
You're just,
you're having a moment‐‐

267
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,196
‐ This is not a moment.
It's my life.

268
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,864
‐ You need to calm her.

269
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,399
She's gonna give
the baby bad humors.

270
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:16,836
‐ I just heard a voice
say bad humors?

271
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,471
‐ You heard that?
‐ You heard me?

272
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,007
Can you still hear me?
This is wonderful.

273
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,375
‐ Yeah.
‐ My name is Charlton.

274
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,177
‐ What the fuck's a Charlton?

275
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,621
‐ So there's a man inside
your head and I heard him?

276
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:35,388
‐ That's it, more or less.
‐ An excellent summation.

277
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,323
‐ Why all of a sudden
could I hear him?

278
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:38,391
And then why did it stop?

279
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,693
‐ I don't know.

280
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:42,362
‐ Well...

281
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:45,198
Her weird baby is developing.

282
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,000
My mother, who was a midwife,

283
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:49,202
once tended a lady
pregnant by a nixie.

284
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:51,004
She often sleepwalked

285
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:52,739
into the sea,
but no ill befell her,

286
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,508
because she developed
gestational gills.

287
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,745
‐ Charlton theorizes that
you had a psychic attack

288
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,013
because of, well,

289
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:02,682
who and what the baby daddy is.

290
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,284
‐ Wait, so you're saying
that's a thing?

291
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:07,186
Me being able to take on
what the baby can do?

292
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,421
‐ Maybe.

293
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,358
‐ Well, maybe this baby
is a traveler.

294
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:14,761
I mean that'd be pretty goddamn
handy right about now, no?

295
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,662
‐ Mm‐hmm.

296
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:17,897
‐ Okay, we need
to quantify this shit.

297
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,408
What's happening,
how can I control it,

298
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:21,334
keep baby safe, and get us
the hell out of here.

299
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:24,470
‐ I studied this.
First year.

300
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,239
They make us take sex ed,

301
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:31,244
inter‐magician relations being
so fraught with STIs and peril.

302
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,279
I think we may have
covered this stuff.

303
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,814
‐ You think, or‐‐

304
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,450
‐ I'm not proud,
but I was on a...

305
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,485
record amount
of greenhouse cannabis.

306
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,221
And so while technically
I heard every single word,

307
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:45,224
it was all, you know,
Sondheim lyrics.

308
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:47,927
I was there,
but in a greater sense,

309
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,330
was I there?

310
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:52,765
‐ Well, perhaps I can help.

311
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,934
If you were,
as you say, there,

312
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,436
perhaps the remembrance
itself is‐‐

313
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:58,971
‐ Is intact in here still
somehow, that is brilliant.

314
00:13:59,005 --> 00:13:59,806
Can you go‐‐
‐ Yeah, I can

315
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,107
certainly attempt.

316
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,443
‐ My imaginary friend is on it.

317
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:05,578
‐ Great.

318
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,448
‐ "Dos and don'ts

319
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:10,450
of magical intercourse."

320
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:12,251
‐ I avoided real college

321
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:14,020
so I wouldn't have
to see shit like this.

322
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:17,123
‐ You kidding?
This is spank bank material.

323
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:20,293
‐ If it burns when you pee,

324
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:22,028
infirmary.

325
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,430
Red bumps like a curse,

326
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:26,132
see a nurse.

327
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:28,234
Scales, feathers, furs‐‐

328
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,203
‐ Medical attention
that rhymes with fur,

329
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,204
read you loud and clear.

330
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:34,273
‐ Now, let's chat
procreation, shall we?

331
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:36,109
Let's start with some basics.

332
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:38,144
Do not assume

333
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,946
that your classmate is human

334
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:43,383
just because they look it.
Hybrids abound.

335
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:46,152
DNA magic develops in utero

336
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:48,321
which can affect
the mother unpredictably,

337
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,523
which can, of course,
result in maiming

338
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,325
or death.

339
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:53,669
If you think you've
been impregnated

340
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:56,396
by a hybrid or creature,

341
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:58,231
you may want
to take precautions

342
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:01,033
to prevent any episodes.

343
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,969
Let's go over a few, shall we?

344
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,138
‐ Excuse me, wait,
I have questions.

345
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:07,140
‐ Who are you?

346
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:09,008
You are not a student here.

347
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,843
‐ Of course I am.

348
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:13,546
I did a thing to my face.
Hello, it's...

349
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,981
Todd.

350
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,150
‐ Todd.

351
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:19,018
Yes, what's your question?

352
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,320
‐ What if a person
wanted the episodes?

353
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:26,058
Let's say the fetus was
psychic, or even a traveler.

354
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,527
‐ I cannot speak to that.

355
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,262
‐ Well, but you are
speaking to that.

356
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,130
‐ This is a memory.

357
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:33,099
I made no mention
of travelers specifically.

358
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:37,003
‐ Okay, but say
I wanted my baby to‐‐

359
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,047
‐ I can only tell you what's
happening in this memory,

360
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:41,340
Todd.
And how to prevent it.

361
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:43,376
‐ But that won't help me.
You see, I need to know‐‐

362
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,077
‐ Hey, genius.

363
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,180
Why don't you just let him
tell you how to stop it

364
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:49,916
and do the opposite?

365
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,618
‐ It's a defense mechanism.

366
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:54,287
The fetus detects
the mother's distress

367
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,222
and reacts protectively.

368
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,424
‐ You freaked the baby out
with your meltdown,

369
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,226
so it psyched you up.

370
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,427
Next?

371
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,505
‐ And this can be avoided
by cultivating a tranquil mind.

372
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,231
Soothing teas, meditation‐‐

373
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,476
‐ Can we just skip to the part
where Julia travels to safety?

374
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,202
‐ Oh, right,
then she'll need to

375
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:11,137
aggressively do the opposite.

376
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,548
‐ The opposite
of tea and meditation?

377
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:14,941
‐ Wait, is he saying
I need to freak out more?

378
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,310
‐ She needs to feel imminent
life or death danger, yes.

379
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,245
‐

380
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,713
Basically.

381
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,615
We need to scare
the living shit out of you.

382
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,617
‐ Great.

383
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,319
‐ This is fine.
Totally fine.

384
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,221
Just a totally normal walk

385
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:29,589
through a totally
normal forest.

386
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:32,692
‐

387
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:41,400
‐ You can't hear that,
but that is a Taker

388
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,569
screaming for some reason.

389
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:45,471
- ‐ Whose eye is that?
- ‐.

390
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:48,107
Nobody's.
It's...

391
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,309
My girlfriend's eye.

392
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,411
‐ That's not better, you know?

393
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,480
‐ She lent it to me.

394
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,249
Where did you come from?

395
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:00,119
How about that?
So did I.

396
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:01,420
So how did you end up
down here?

397
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:03,789
‐ I was taken
with my friends.

398
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:06,125
‐ Friends.
Friends are good.

399
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,126
Uh, where are they?

400
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:11,364
‐ The Takers put them
in a big, shiny cave.

401
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:12,999
It opens sideways.

402
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,468
And when you poke
its big, yellow eye,

403
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:19,138
its mouth opens
and says "ding."

404
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,640
‐ That sounds like an elevator.

405
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:22,108
‐ Is that a kind of monster?

406
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,176
‐ No, not a monster.
A machine.

407
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,344
‐ That eats people?

408
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,314
‐ No, it goes up,
it goes down.

409
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:31,117
It's just weird that it's here.

410
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,528
Maybe we should check it out.
Do you know where‐‐

411
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,554
‐ Are you an adult?
‐ Of course.

412
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:37,156
Do I not seem like an adult?

413
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:39,492
‐ Adults lie and say
everything's okay

414
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:40,660
when it really isn't.

415
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:42,361
‐
‐ Then Takers come.

416
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,996
I'm not helping an adult.

417
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,132
‐ Oh, please.
No.

418
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,801
God, just wait!

419
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,503
‐
‐ No, wait! No!

420
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,338
No, don't touch.
Let me go.

421
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:53,673
No, let me go.
‐ Hey.

422
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:56,175
‐ No, no, no!
‐ Hey.

423
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,743
Uh, you like this?

424
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:59,745
Yeah, shiny, right?

425
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,547
Yeah, good.
Go get it.

426
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:05,851
‐
‐ Hey, hey, hey, you okay?

427
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:07,520
‐ Yeah.
How did you do that?

428
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,722
‐ Luck.
Let's get the hell out of here.

429
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:13,659
That'll do it.

430
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:16,696
My own personal Mar‐Go‐Pro.

431
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:18,540
Trust me, where I'm from,
that was really clever.

432
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,066
‐ Well, here it's stupid, okay?

433
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,369
Now here's the cave over there,
okay?

434
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:25,271
‐ Okay.
Looks clear.

435
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,673
Let's get a little closer
and see where it goes.

436
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:30,209
Come on.
Shh.

437
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,720
Underworld?
‐ Do we not want to go there?

438
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,123
‐ Uh...

439
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,525
‐

440
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:49,705
‐ Underworld sounds
pretty good right now.

441
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:51,130
‐

442
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:53,065
‐ Come on.
Come on!

443
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:55,434
‐

444
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,403
‐ Oh!

445
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,205
Not today, Takers.

446
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:00,406
‐

447
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:03,476
But where are we going?

448
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,558
So this is the Underworld?

449
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:22,294
And it's where we go
when we die?

450
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:26,766
Does this mean we're dead?

451
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,467
‐ No, no, we're not.

452
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:32,071
I mean, neither of us died.

453
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:35,107
Technically, so...

454
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:37,777
‐ Are my friends dead?

455
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,112
‐ Look.

456
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:41,647
I don't know.

457
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,617
And I'm not gonna lie,
this isn't good.

458
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,153
But I promise you

459
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:51,457
I'm going to whatever I can to
get us both out of here, okay?

460
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,892
‐ You better.

461
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:57,863
‐ Let's see if we can
find some help.

462
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:05,805
"Welcome, you are dead.
Please take a card."

463
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,542
‐ Take a card.

464
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,343
You can read, can't you?

465
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,679
‐
Right, question.

466
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:16,882
Where do we go if we...

467
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,518
Aren't dead?

468
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,654
‐ If you're here,
you're dead.

469
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,789
And if you're dead,
you take a card.

470
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:25,357
‐
But I'm not dead.

471
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,193
I can't be dead.
Please, mister.

472
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,328
There must be someone
we can talk to.

473
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:31,997
‐ Great, now look
what you've done.

474
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:35,101
‐ I'll see
if I can find someone.

475
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:37,169
‐ Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You okay?

476
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:38,370
‐

477
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,372
Of course.
I do this all the time.

478
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:41,841
Crying makes
adults uncomfortable.

479
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:43,375
‐ Not bad.
‐

480
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,244
‐ Hoberman?

481
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,313
‐ Penny?
‐ What the fuck?

482
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,215
What are you doing here?

483
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,468
‐ Remind me why you dragged me
to the Brakebills Lab

484
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:02,328
instead of staying
in our comfortable penthouse?

485
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:03,572
‐ We had to bring you somewhere

486
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,397
where we could
control circumstances.

487
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,943
Besides, I'm going to have to
rely on Kady to do any casting.

488
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,869
‐ I don't even know
what to start.

489
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:11,203
‐ Trash can.

490
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:12,872
‐ Oh. Okay.
‐ What?

491
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:16,742
‐

492
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,377
‐ That I can handle.

493
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,250
‐ I can see the tether
between you and your eye

494
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,818
and it's kind of
between worlds.

495
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:26,652
It's all glitchy.

496
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:29,355
I think we should
sever the connection

497
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:30,890
before it does
permanent damage.

498
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:34,393
‐ My fairy eye is the only
connection I have to Josh.

499
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,829
You cut that out,
I cut out your uterus.

500
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,666
‐ Uh, Margo?
Just a gentle observation.

501
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:41,934
If you scorch your brain pan,

502
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,569
that won't be great
for Josh either.

503
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:46,939
‐
‐ Okay.

504
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,541
‐

505
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,444
‐ Okay.

506
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:53,412
That won't work for long,

507
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,614
so we're gonna need
a solution yesterday.

508
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,716
‐ Yeah, okay.
You stay with her.

509
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,685
Fen, come with me.
I'm going to need help.

510
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:10,696
‐ I'm gonna need to get
a couple other things stat.

511
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:12,865
‐ I can only bring
authorized items.

512
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:14,733
‐ Well...
‐

513
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:17,536
‐ Then ask a doctor
about premature labor.

514
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,271
And get it authorized.

515
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:21,440
‐
‐ Now.

516
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,410
‐ Ow.

517
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:27,479
‐ Five stalks
green nightshade,

518
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:30,549
one dead quail unplucked,
rock salt,

519
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,785
and two fingers of bourbon.
Now.

520
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:34,620
‐ Ow, ow.
It really hurts.

521
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:36,589
‐ Ask the king if he wants
this woman to die.

522
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:39,124
I need to cast something
to stop her pain.

523
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:42,394
Or alternately, oceans
of blood on your hands, friend.

524
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:44,296
Chop chop.

525
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,533
‐ Hey. Psst.

526
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:49,602
Okay, so what's
all that really for?

527
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:52,404
‐ I need you scared,
and you don't scare easy.

528
00:22:52,438 --> 00:22:54,840
So the less you know,
the better.

529
00:22:56,175 --> 00:22:57,610
Gruel?

530
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:01,447
‐ Hey, you think Ash
will be fine

531
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,749
with, uh, what's‐her‐name,
right?

532
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:05,417
‐ Kathy?

533
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:07,586
Old friend.
She's great with kids.

534
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:11,423
Should feel like recess
plus birthday.

535
00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:13,792
‐ It's just me and the kid
kind of have this.

536
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:17,763
Newt and Ripley thing going.
I promised I'd get her home.

537
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:22,401
‐ Then I should get
the bad news out of the way.

538
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:25,437
I can't help you.
‐ Why the hell not?

539
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:26,939
‐ Take a look around.

540
00:23:26,972 --> 00:23:29,074
Librarians have been going
through some shit lately.

541
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:32,111
No magic, too much magic,
but unpredictable.

542
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:35,948
A lot of our folks
got relocated, and we...

543
00:23:35,981 --> 00:23:38,784
Kind of don't exactly
know where.

544
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,519
Okay, perfect world,

545
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:43,022
boss steps in,
oversees shit.

546
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:44,957
But...

547
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,727
Hades is vanished.

548
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:51,463
‐ Your boss is the god, Hades?

549
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:52,965
That's cool,

550
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:55,367
except for
the abandoning you part.

551
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:57,303
‐ I can't say that's great.

552
00:23:57,336 --> 00:23:58,971
Kind of skeleton crew.

553
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:01,707
And here's
the bad news for you.

554
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,409
Our connection to the world
of the living?

555
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,443
Hades controls that.

556
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:07,713
And right before he FO'd,
he flipped the switch.

557
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:09,014
‐ Why?

558
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:11,450
‐

559
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:15,020
‐ Man, dead you is
just way more zen.

560
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:18,090
So after all that,
why did you stay?

561
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,859
‐ I make a promise,
I keep it.

562
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:23,562
‐ Look, bro, I hear you
and bad timing.

563
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:25,531
But me and the kid?
We didn't die.

564
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:27,833
We just got dragged
into a weird netherworld

565
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:30,502
by the Takers.
‐ Right, you said.

566
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:31,537
Never heard of them.

567
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:34,006
‐ Well, I promise you
they're real and they suck.

568
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:36,108
And we are in the wrong place.

569
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,510
I mean, this can't be
the first time in history

570
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:40,846
not dead people
ended up here, right?

571
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,314
Accidents happen.

572
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:43,849
There's got to be
some protocol

573
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:46,752
or some special
dispensation thing.

574
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:48,687
‐ Anyone sent
to the Underworld by mistake

575
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:50,889
has 24 hours
to file a dispute.

576
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:52,758
‐ Great, let's file a dispute.

577
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:56,662
‐ Disputes have
to be sent up top.

578
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:59,064
And since Hades left,
we can't.

579
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:03,068
‐ So if we don't find Hades,
we're just stuck?

580
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:04,603
‐ I'm sorry.

581
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:08,974
‐ Does he have, like,
a pager or a walkie?

582
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:11,377
‐ If he doesn't want
to be found, he won't be.

583
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,479
The Underworld is big.

584
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,680
He could be anywhere.

585
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:18,751
‐ Well could I maybe get a map
and start checking things off?

586
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,488
‐ Shit.

587
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:26,658
I might know someone
who can help.

588
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:30,129
God, but it is the suck option.

589
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:37,569
‐ Penny, you got my invite.

590
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:38,937
‐ Uh...

591
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:41,640
‐ Oh, you need something.

592
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:43,075
‐ Sorry, man.

593
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:45,644
‐
This is so typical.

594
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:47,946
You don't come to my brunches,
which I guess is fine,

595
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,481
but you could at least RSVP.

596
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:52,651
‐ That is
the polite thing to do

597
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:54,920
so he doesn't have
too much food.

598
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,124
‐ That makes sense.

599
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:01,860
‐ Anyway, we need an expert.

600
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,095
That is why we're here.

601
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:06,765
And I gather you are the guy
who knows where everything is.

602
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,635
‐ Well, I do know
a thing or two.

603
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,037
And I am very generous
with my time,

604
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,238
unlike some people.

605
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:15,641
‐ We are looking for Hades.

606
00:26:15,674 --> 00:26:17,543
Penny thinks you might know
where he is.

607
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,844
‐ I have no idea.

608
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,779
Penny told you
he disappeared, right?

609
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:21,647
Very odd.

610
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,615
Usually there's
at least one person

611
00:26:23,649 --> 00:26:25,517
who can get a hold of him.
This time‐‐

612
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:27,553
‐ But you know all his spots?

613
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:30,122
‐ Gods no.
Quite the opposite.

614
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:32,791
He is insanely strict on me.

615
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:36,195
You know, I'm not even allowed
to map the place where he...

616
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:37,863
Wait a minute.

617
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:43,502
He forbade me from mapping
an area in the Underworld.

618
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:46,705
I always suspected he had some
kind of special retreat there.

619
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,807
‐ I'm sorry, if it's
not on the map,

620
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:50,642
what good
would that do us?

621
00:26:50,676 --> 00:26:52,654
‐ Well, because I mapped
everything else around it.

622
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:57,182
So in an ironic way, it's
like I mapped it... perfectly.

623
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:58,817
‐

624
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:08,193
‐ Is it time to put
another scratch mark up?

625
00:27:08,227 --> 00:27:10,229
It's been a day,

626
00:27:10,262 --> 00:27:11,830
right?

627
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:13,832
I can't tell anymore.

628
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:16,201
‐ I think your count is short.

629
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:19,238
We've been here
longer than a month.

630
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:21,874
‐ This whole conversation
is predicated

631
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:23,575
on time having meaning,

632
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:26,845
which it doesn't in here, so.

633
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:32,618
‐ A time traveler walks
into a bar in Vienna, 1908.

634
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:37,589
Sits next to a young
art student named Adolf Hitler.

635
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:40,692
Adolf sighs into his beer.

636
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:43,095
"You know what I hate?"
he asks.

637
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:45,631
Time traveler says,

638
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,033
"I don't know, Jews?"

639
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:52,704
And Hitler goes,
"Huh, now that you mention it."

640
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,542
I mean, you got
to laugh, right?

641
00:27:56,575 --> 00:27:57,576
‐ You're right.

642
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:59,811
There are no good jokes
about time traveling.

643
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:02,047
‐ At first, I thought
it was better at least

644
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,217
that we don't get hungry
or tired or need to pee.

645
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:08,253
But it's just‐‐
‐ Fucking torture.

646
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:12,524
‐ The sameness.
It is intolerable.

647
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:16,962
‐ Hey, hey, hey.
We are tolerating fine.

648
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:18,730
Hey, we are going
to figure this out.

649
00:28:18,764 --> 00:28:21,633
‐ There is nothing
to figure out.

650
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:24,636
It is what it is.

651
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:29,408
There is just one decision.

652
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:31,276
I'd still be
a regular traveler.

653
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,078
‐ No, that's not happening.

654
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:36,348
‐ This is it, Penny.
The Chatwin curse.

655
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,250
The tipping of the scale.

656
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:40,152
‐ No, this is just some
self‐important asshole

657
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:41,753
we need to outsmart.

658
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:43,755
I'm not letting you
be forced into a decision

659
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:44,923
that's gonna ruin your life.

660
00:28:44,957 --> 00:28:46,425
‐ It's not my life
exactly, it's‐‐

661
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,327
‐ You don't know what it is.

662
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,297
You are at the beginning.
That's why, no.

663
00:28:52,331 --> 00:28:56,301
‐ We could be here forever

664
00:28:56,335 --> 00:28:58,837
if we don't do something.

665
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,143
‐ What are you doing?
‐ I'm making my decision.

666
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:41,879
‐ Wow.

667
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:46,818
The Underworld is in shambles,
and Hades is out here doing...

668
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:50,222
Whatever this is?

669
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:52,057
‐ Pink Himalayan sea salt.

670
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,727
I do a great salt‐crusted cod
with a lovely...

671
00:29:55,761 --> 00:29:57,896
You know what, never mind.
Not important.

672
00:29:57,929 --> 00:29:59,641
‐ He uses it as a spa bath. It
extracts toxins.

673
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:01,800
It's a great stress releaser
if you‐‐.

674
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:03,869
So I've heard.
‐ Excuse me.

675
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:05,404
This temple is off limits.

676
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:07,306
‐ Yes, hi.
We are looking for Hades.

677
00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:08,874
‐ He's unavailable.

678
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:09,775
‐ Respectfully,

679
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,810
we wouldn't come here
if it wasn't urgent.

680
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:14,313
Can you please let him know
that we are here?

681
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:16,014
‐ No, he's gone.

682
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:18,250
‐ Well, he can't just be gone.

683
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:21,186
‐ I assume you're here
because he just up and left.

684
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:23,322
And you're worried
it was for good.

685
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:24,990
Well, I'm sorry to tell you,

686
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:27,025
when he left, he told me
he might never be back.

687
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:28,660
‐ Wait, what?
‐ Never?

688
00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:30,429
‐ He didn't feel
like elaborating.

689
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:31,496
‐ It's just some of us

690
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:32,707
are trying to keep
the Underworld running.

691
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:35,834
‐ Yeah, and some of us
are trying to map it.

692
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,669
‐ And he is a god.

693
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:39,404
He doesn't answer
to any of you.

694
00:30:39,438 --> 00:30:41,673
‐ Well, excuse me, please‐‐
‐ Uh, guys?

695
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:44,376
I think I got something.

696
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:47,346
Let's just hope
Margo's still watching.

697
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:51,183
‐ So here's the plan.

698
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:53,885
We separate the signal
before it enters Margo's brain

699
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:54,753
and then we deflect it.

700
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:57,222
‐ Like put it somewhere else?
How?

701
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:59,291
‐ With this.

702
00:30:59,324 --> 00:31:02,294
Now, I have a mixed history
with prism spells,

703
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:04,463
so you're going to need
to check my math.

704
00:31:04,496 --> 00:31:08,300
‐ This feels weird as fuck.

705
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,235
‐ Just don't move.

706
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:13,038
‐ Did you‐‐did you poke
her brain parts?

707
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:14,373
‐ What?

708
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:15,574
‐ How does that feel?

709
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:18,510
‐ Like you just stuck a
flash drive into my jello hole.

710
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:22,848
Oh, my God.

711
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,058
I feel something
coming through.

712
00:31:24,082 --> 00:31:27,085
What the fuck?

713
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:30,422
‐ Oh, channel Josh is live.

714
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:31,990
‐ How does it feel?

715
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:34,226
‐ Like I'm getting acupuncture
inside my brain,

716
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:35,260
but it doesn't hurt.

717
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:37,996
Well, thank God he's alive.

718
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:41,032
Except where
the shitfaced Jesus is he?

719
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:44,469
‐ Wait,
why is Penny in Taker Land?

720
00:31:44,503 --> 00:31:46,338
‐ That's not‐‐that's
not that Penny.

721
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:49,074
That's... that's Penny.
That's my Penny.

722
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:51,410
‐ But that would mean
that Josh is in the Underworld.

723
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:53,011
‐ No, no, no, no, no.
That would mean‐‐

724
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:55,147
‐ Josh is dead?

725
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:58,817
‐ Maybe he's trying to tell us
that he's still alive

726
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,719
and needs our help.

727
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:05,023
But I don't get it.
Isn't Hades down there?

728
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:08,860
‐ I am so confused.

729
00:32:08,894 --> 00:32:11,997
An address! In Queens!

730
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,166
Hades is on Earth?
‐ Well, shit, go check.

731
00:32:14,199 --> 00:32:17,369
I'd come with, but I've got
a goddamn movie projector

732
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:19,171
stuck in my eye hole.

733
00:32:19,204 --> 00:32:23,141
‐ Okay, now arrange
the feathers in front of you

734
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:26,845
in a triangle,
and then drink this.

735
00:32:26,878 --> 00:32:28,046
‐ What's the bourbon for?

736
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,815
‐ It's for me.

737
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:35,320
‐ Ugh.

738
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:38,957
‐ Okay, so, um, this isn't
going to do anything

739
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,559
to you or mini you physically.

740
00:32:40,592 --> 00:32:45,030
But, um, you will feel a huge
shot of fear and anxiety,

741
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,298
and it's not gonna be nice.

742
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:48,200
So hopefully that'll
do something.

743
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:50,268
Okay, bottoms up.

744
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:54,539
Now listen to exactly
what I'm going to say

745
00:32:54,573 --> 00:32:58,543
because the next part
can get a little bit, um...

746
00:32:58,577 --> 00:33:00,178
‐

747
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:01,313
‐ Weird.

748
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:03,548
Okay, on my count.

749
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:06,184
Three, two...

750
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:08,086
‐

751
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:09,588
What?

752
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:11,656
Oh, my God.
My water just broke.

753
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,892
‐ What?
‐ That's very bad.

754
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:15,336
‐ Oh, my God,
the baby's coming, Eliot.

755
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,828
‐ Tell her to lay on her back.

756
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:19,130
‐ I can't lay on back.
It's coming.

757
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:20,866
It's too soon.
This is way too soon.

758
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:22,543
Eliot, please, do something.
You have to get a guard.

759
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,035
‐ Guard!
‐ They won't come.

760
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:25,413
They never come between meals.
‐ Oh, shit.

761
00:33:25,437 --> 00:33:26,338
‐ I'm sorry.

762
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:28,073
‐ Eliot, you have
to get us out of here.

763
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:30,242
‐ I can't.
Tell the baby.

764
00:33:30,275 --> 00:33:32,410
‐ Okay.
Okay, baby, we got to go.

765
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:33,678
We got to go.
Okay, baby?

766
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:36,081
We got to go.
Oh, we got to go.

767
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:37,582
‐ Okay, how does Penny travel?

768
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:40,185
He pictures it
in his mind, right?

769
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:42,287
Right, okay, so picture it
in your mind.

770
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,222
Picture the other side
of the bars.

771
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:45,690
‐ I'm trying.
I can't.

772
00:33:45,724 --> 00:33:46,925
‐ Now, Julia.

773
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:48,293
‐ I'm trying, El.
I can't.

774
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:50,061
‐ Come on, Jules.
Now.

775
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,464
‐ Oh, my God.

776
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:55,700
Eliot, I did it.
It worked.

777
00:33:55,734 --> 00:33:57,202
‐ Yes.
Okay, now do it for real.

778
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:58,937
‐ What?

779
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,672
‐ I'm sorry.

780
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,478
‐ You motherfucker.

781
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:08,146
You incepted me.

782
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,581
‐ Your baby's strong.

783
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,149
It took three castings
to deceive it.

784
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:12,226
‐ I had to make you believe it,

785
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:14,161
so we had to tell you
the spell was something else.

786
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:15,229
‐ Honestly, fuck
the both of you.

787
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:18,290
‐ Get mad later.
Use the adrenaline right now.

788
00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:21,426
Do it again.

789
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:23,895
Now, Julia.
‐ Go to hell.

790
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:34,139
My baby is awesome.

791
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:36,575
‐ Celebrate later,
escape now.

792
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:38,310
Keys.

793
00:34:38,343 --> 00:34:40,378
‐ Right.
‐

794
00:34:51,156 --> 00:34:52,156
‐ Alice, Kady.

795
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:55,627
Been expecting you.

796
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:07,539
So did you come here to watch
me play video games or what?

797
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:10,141
‐ Our friend is trapped
in the Underworld

798
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:11,309
but he isn't dead.

799
00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:13,612
‐ Wow, how did
he manage to do that?

800
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:17,649
‐ Well, he's gifted
at screwing up.

801
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:19,384
Can you please help him?

802
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,519
‐
Sorry, can't.

803
00:35:21,553 --> 00:35:23,622
‐ Of course you can.
You run the Underworld.

804
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:25,724
‐ I did, but then I quit.

805
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:27,525
‐ You what?
Can you even do that?

806
00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:28,660
‐ I can do what I want.

807
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:30,729
‐ But why?

808
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:33,331
Our friend,
he's not supposed to be there.

809
00:35:33,365 --> 00:35:35,200
‐ You think death is fair?

810
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:37,102
You think life is fair?

811
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,704
Skip the sales pitch,
Kady Orloff‐Diaz.

812
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:42,741
I know your life,
so I know you know better.

813
00:35:42,774 --> 00:35:46,411
Give me one reason you deserve
to be treated any better

814
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:49,814
than the rest of us,
and I'll help.

815
00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:52,350
Otherwise, you're
messing up my game.

816
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,523
‐ What is wrong with him?

817
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:01,359
Why is every god we meet
such a nutsack?

818
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:05,530
‐ Look around.

819
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:07,332
What do you see?

820
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:13,605
‐ A shitty apartment?

821
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,407
‐ Shades drawn,

822
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,343
take‐out,
he's a mess.

823
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:20,245
Look familiar?

824
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,582
It's me after Q died.

825
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:28,219
‐ Oh, my God.

826
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:34,259
Our Lady Underground
was his wife.

827
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:37,228
And the monster's sister,
she killed her.

828
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,899
The God of the Dead
is in mourning.

829
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:45,904
‐ Let me try to talk to him.

830
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,577
‐ Figured it out, huh?

831
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:56,448
‐ Can you just put that down
and talk to me for a second?

832
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:03,688
‐
Look.

833
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:07,125
There's nothing to say.

834
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:09,661
It's not the same,
your grief and mine.

835
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:12,597
‐ I disagree.
I think when you lose someone‐‐

836
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,765
‐ When you die,

837
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:15,633
you go somewhere.

838
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:17,869
You know how I know?
'Cause I built it.

839
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,138
For you.
To help you.

840
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:23,074
Quentin?
Penny?

841
00:37:23,108 --> 00:37:25,343
I eased their passage.

842
00:37:27,178 --> 00:37:30,115
There's no Underworld for gods.

843
00:37:30,148 --> 00:37:31,783
‐ What happens to you?

844
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:34,352
‐ I don't know.

845
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:39,691
We're not supposed to die,
but...

846
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:43,795
she did, and...

847
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:46,331
that's all I get to know.

848
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:47,699
Forever.

849
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:51,870
See, you'll die someday.

850
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:54,305
But I won't.

851
00:37:56,708 --> 00:37:59,644
‐ I'm sorry.

852
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:03,882
I wish there was something
I could say to help.

853
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:07,652
Our friend, Josh, didn't die.

854
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:10,288
He was in
the Taker Realm, and‐‐

855
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:11,790
‐ Well, that's not possible.

856
00:38:11,823 --> 00:38:14,159
That place doesn't connect
to the world above.

857
00:38:14,192 --> 00:38:16,327
‐ Well, someone opened a door.

858
00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:19,297
‐ That's very bad.

859
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,633
The creatures you call Takers,
do you know what they are?

860
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,601
‐

861
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,737
‐ They're guard dogs.

862
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,672
Their realm is
a security measure.

863
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:30,675
A barrier between your world
and the world of the dead.

864
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:33,645
If a soul tries to come back,
it takes them

865
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:36,014
and returns them
to the Underworld.

866
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:37,215
Trust me.

867
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:38,492
The dead coming back
to the living,

868
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:39,517
that's not a good thing.

869
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:41,553
‐ So if they're in Fillory?

870
00:38:41,586 --> 00:38:42,987
‐ Then somebody opened a door

871
00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:44,722
that should not
have been opened.

872
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:47,559
‐ And I think I know why.

873
00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:49,561
What if it was
a person like us,

874
00:38:49,594 --> 00:38:53,531
who just wanted to bring back
someone he loved?

875
00:38:56,868 --> 00:38:59,771
‐ I leave for a couple months,
and everything goes to shit.

876
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:06,511
I will help your friend.

877
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:08,613
But you will
clean up this mess.

878
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:11,716
Stop whoever's trying
to get past the Takers.

879
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:14,853
If you don't, and let me
say this very clearly,

880
00:39:14,886 --> 00:39:17,555
your world will be
destroyed too.

881
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:19,290
‐ Destroyed how?

882
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:21,726
‐ If this person were
to get past the Takers,

883
00:39:21,759 --> 00:39:23,261
there would be just one door

884
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:25,430
between them and the person
that they lost.

885
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:28,733
And if they were
to crack that door,

886
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:31,703
who knows how many of the dead
would spill through.

887
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:34,873
Not just
the one he wants,

888
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:38,443
but all the dead.

889
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:41,012
It could mean
the end of everything.

890
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:03,868
‐ I think we're back.

891
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:07,038
Fillory smells a lot
better than Takerville.

892
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:13,378
I didn't think
you were a hugger.

893
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,746
‐ Shut up.

894
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,618
‐

895
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,427
‐ Look.

896
00:40:32,964 --> 00:40:36,567
‐ Oh, my God.
They're all dead.

897
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:40,939
‐ Is that a good thing?

898
00:40:40,972 --> 00:40:42,540
‐ I don't know.

899
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,785
‐ Okay, we should stop.

900
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:54,786
‐ It's okay.

901
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:56,621
I can do this.

902
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:00,325
‐ Okay. All right, come here.

903
00:41:03,995 --> 00:41:06,597
He said this was
eradicating your‐‐

904
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:09,033
‐ Timey wimey plasma factor.

905
00:41:09,067 --> 00:41:11,636
‐ Why does it look like
this is collecting it?

906
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:14,639
‐ What?
Let me see that.

907
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:15,974
‐ Your hand is shaking.

908
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:17,475
‐

909
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:19,644
I don't want this.
Get this thing off.

910
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:20,979
‐

911
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:23,448
‐ What the hell is it now?
Step away from her.

912
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:26,551
‐ This is how you
unburden her curse?

913
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:28,152
By collecting it?

914
00:41:28,186 --> 00:41:30,488
‐ You don't understand
what you're talking about.

915
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:31,656
Put that down.

916
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:34,659
‐ How about I smash it?
‐ Wait.

917
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:35,827
Stop.
Okay.

918
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:39,163
‐ Your hand.
That tremor.

919
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:40,732
That's what happens
when you run low?

920
00:41:40,765 --> 00:41:42,667
Your finite supply?

921
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,969
‐ Do you ever stop
asking questions?

922
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:48,039
‐ You're not a guardian
of space‐time.

923
00:41:48,072 --> 00:41:49,674
You're a junkie.

924
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:50,541
‐ I wasn't lying‐‐

925
00:41:50,575 --> 00:41:53,177
‐ You used the signal
to find us

926
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:55,713
so you can take what we have
to use for yourself.

927
00:41:55,747 --> 00:41:58,416
‐ I wasn't lying
about what I do.

928
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:00,518
Time travelers are so rare.

929
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:03,154
But you spend your life
chasing them to unflap

930
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:06,491
every butterfly wing, it feels
like they're everywhere.

931
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,593
I'm just trying to stop idiots

932
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:10,862
from destroying
the entire universe.

933
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:12,864
‐ Oh, it's interesting
that idiots

934
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:14,732
include everyone except you.

935
00:42:14,766 --> 00:42:16,901
‐ Tell me most people
can be trusted.

936
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:19,904
Tell me more power
makes people better.

937
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:22,573
No?
I thought so.

938
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:28,746
I have been keeping
this whole thing together,

939
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,648
by myself, forever.

940
00:42:30,681 --> 00:42:33,084
‐ You didn't think
you could ask me for help?

941
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:34,585
‐ Oh, I tried a few times

942
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:37,455
with a few of you
when I was your age.

943
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:39,390
I believed in people.

944
00:42:39,424 --> 00:42:41,135
‐ You mean back before
you thought you were better

945
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:42,960
than everyone else?

946
00:42:42,994 --> 00:42:45,763
‐ You can't understand
unless you've seen what I have.

947
00:42:45,797 --> 00:42:47,732
And I wouldn't wish that
on the devil.

948
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:50,068
It's why I put you here.

949
00:42:50,101 --> 00:42:52,603
One day, maybe you'll
know enough to thank me.

950
00:42:52,637 --> 00:42:54,472
‐ Okay, brass tacks.
We're leaving.

951
00:42:54,505 --> 00:42:56,574
‐ When she finishes‐‐
‐ I won't.

952
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:57,575
‐ She's not finishing.

953
00:42:57,608 --> 00:43:00,545
She's walking away
with whatever's in her veins

954
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,014
in exchange for this.

955
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:08,619
‐ I can't let her go if she‐‐
‐ That's the deal.

956
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:13,958
‐ Fine.

957
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:19,564
Learn not to time travel.

958
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,265
Because hear me.

959
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:24,235
If you go back,
if you change a hair on a fly,

960
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:27,105
you will be seeing me.

961
00:43:27,138 --> 00:43:30,141
And it will be the very
last time you see anyone.

962
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:33,978
‐ Can't wait.

963
00:43:37,882 --> 00:43:39,550
Hey, help!

964
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,655
‐ Okay, she's breathing.
She's coming to.

965
00:43:44,689 --> 00:43:46,557
‐ Oh.

966
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:50,962
Yeah, uh,

967
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:53,764
we should probably talk.
