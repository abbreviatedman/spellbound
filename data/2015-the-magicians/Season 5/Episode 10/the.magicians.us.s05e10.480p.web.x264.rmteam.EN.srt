1
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,880
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,030
The Takers are swarming.

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,106
They're swarming because Seb
summoned them with a spell.

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,906
Okay, so what if we locate
the tree from Seb's tattoo

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:17,500
and chop it down?

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:18,616
Would that sever this conduit?

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,370
In theory, yes.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,640
He would be mortal
and 100% stab-able.

9
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,710
I wouldn't if I were you.

10
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,310
Surprised?

11
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:33,150
I just have a problem,
and it's getting worse.

12
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,990
Whoa.

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,720
I traveled us to 1998.

14
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,390
This is where
the signal brought us.

15
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,130
It was just a room.

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,300
No windows, no doors.

17
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,170
We can't leave.

18
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,700
That's Ms. Persephone.

19
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,400
That's Our Lady Underground.

20
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,140
When the sister was in me,

21
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,040
I remember everything.

22
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,340
- Promise.
- Give me the page.

23
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,310
If the finger's still viable,
I reattach.

24
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,526
Hey, what happened to your eye?

25
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:04,380
I lent it to Josh.

26
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,680
I'm keeping an eye on him, okay?

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,180
Hold up.

28
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:09,650
Somebody's near Josh.

29
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,790
It's the Dark King.
He's coming.

30
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,560
Your Highness.

31
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,370
I mean, Your Majesty.

32
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,270
I think there's been a huge...
No mistake.

33
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,570
You were part of the plot
to kill me, were you not?

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,110
- I wouldn't say that exactly.
- It doesn't matter.

35
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,280
There is a way you can
make it up to me.

36
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,580
To Fillory.

37
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:37,580
- Okay, sure.
- Uh, what?

38
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:40,120
Down.

39
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:43,250
You are a brave, brave man.

40
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,730
- Right.
- Thank you.

41
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,330
Uh... oh,
is this a blood brothers

42
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,200
kind of thing?

43
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,600
I'm guessing this isn't
a medal of valor.

44
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,710
What are you doing?

45
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,320
Your death will not be in vain.

46
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,520
But I will miss your cooking.

47
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,650
What?

48
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,230
- No. No.
- No, no, please.

49
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,530
Please, please.

50
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,400
No, no, no.

51
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,230
No.

52
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,410
The walls are solid.

53
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,820
There's no buttons or switches.

54
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:48,250
Everything I cast is wrong here.

55
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,320
Circumstances are
impossible to read.

56
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,760
Okay, are you sure

57
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,760
this is the room that
the signal brought you to?

58
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:57,690
Yes, but I can't remember
where here is.

59
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,330
Oh, good.

60
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,476
I've still got
the welter's plaque.

61
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,270
Let's just try again.

62
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,400
It didn't work last time.

63
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,340
- Come, come.
- Sit, sit, sit, sit.

64
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,680
- The signal pulled us back.
- You were right.

65
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,180
That's why you should listen
to your elders, Plum.

66
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,050
Who the hell are you?

67
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,790
That was a Tiffany lamp,
you know.

68
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,690
Crafted from a design I acquired

69
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,520
from Clara Driscoll herself.
It took me ages to make.

70
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,830
Do I need to tell you
how much I don't give a shit?

71
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,330
- Why are we here?
- What do you want?

72
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,200
I want you to stop
time traveling.

73
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,300
Are you, like, the God of Time

74
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,440
- or something?
- Hardly.

75
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,440
I'm a time traveler
like young Plum here.

76
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,210
I have been monitoring you.

77
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:47,310
And now you're
keeping us prisoner?

78
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,380
This one will be smart,
I thought.

79
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,520
Cautious.

80
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,520
Then you had to risk
altering the future

81
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,220
to save some young pervert.

82
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,236
So is this the part where
you draw us little diagrams

83
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,360
about screwing up the flow
of time or whatever?

84
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,930
Nice thing about
the 21st century.

85
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,490
You've all seen "Looper."

86
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,160
So I can get to the point.

87
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,330
We are here because though
I would rather be making lamps,

88
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:14,440
I am forced to focus on the
most important task there is,

89
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:18,240
protecting the integrity
of space-time.

90
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,710
Which you threaten.

91
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,880
I'd have hoped you'd waste
your time on something useful.

92
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,780
Try to kill Hitler at least.

93
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,220
I was getting to it.

94
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,420
I'm not an asshole.
I just found out.

95
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,720
Well, doing any
of those things would be...

96
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,460
Would be a royal cluster.

97
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,860
We get it.
She gets it.

98
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:37,760
Yeah, she does loud and clear.

99
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,300
We promise not to change
the past anymore.

100
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,200
Can we leave?

101
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:45,300
Well, this isn't
a pinky-swear situation.

102
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,700
I know how intoxicating

103
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,440
the prospect
of altering time can be.

104
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,310
"Just this once."

105
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,580
I'd like to relieve you
of that burden.

106
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,920
This device neutralizes
your abilities.

107
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,890
It's painless...
It's got fucking teeth.

108
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,060
It's painless once it's on.

109
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,930
Works quickly
and permanently to eradicate.

110
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,830
And you can still traverse
space like your peers.

111
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,000
Traveling is in our DNA.

112
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,800
What exactly would
you be eradicating?

113
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,400
Plum, you and I

114
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,770
have a mutation of
the plasma factor of the blood.

115
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:26,510
Luckily, we stop producing it
by the time we can walk.

116
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,780
What's in you now, it's finite.

117
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,010
When we traverse time,
we use up a fraction of it.

118
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:36,590
So you want to take away
the thing that makes me, me?

119
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,320
That's dramatic.

120
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:40,820
I'm offering to rid you
of your curse.

121
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,860
I can't force you.

122
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:46,460
You must consent or
the spell work won't function.

123
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,330
It's up to you.

124
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,700
I'm offering to free you.

125
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,640
No, this is crazy.

126
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:55,810
You have no right
to drag us both here...

127
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,440
I didn't.

128
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,280
You, Professor, are a hanger-on.

129
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,980
The signal was meant for her.

130
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,480
I won't do it.

131
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,550
Oh, they can never just say yes.

132
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:08,580
Well, whenever
you change your mind,

133
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,020
simply place your arm
inside the cuff.

134
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:13,790
He can't help you.
You have to do it yourself.

135
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,460
Till then, enjoy
my space out of time.

136
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,460
My name is Eliphas, by the way.

137
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,800
Friends call me Eli.

138
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,470
So Eliphas.

139
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,710
Is he just gonna leave us here?

140
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,030
How do they feel?

141
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,670
Like ghost fingers.

142
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,340
They work, but magically,
they still feel severed.

143
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,010
So you can't cast?

144
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,010
Not really, no.

145
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,080
One-handed

146
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,480
and that pretty much
rules out most spells.

147
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:14,150
I'm not gonna forget
what you did.

148
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,090
We're gonna get
those pricks for this.

149
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,890
- I don't know, Kady.
- Maybe we should just walk away.

150
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,690
You can walk away,
but to be clear,

151
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,460
I'm not done until I cut that
son of a bitch's balls off.

152
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,530
I owe them that for tying me up,

153
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,530
and I owe them triple
for what they did to you.

154
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:32,570
You can sit it out, okay?

155
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,740
- Um, no.
- We're in this together.

156
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:42,450
Oh, it's just
so beautiful, you guys.

157
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,780
Female friendship really is

158
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,880
the most underrated
form of love, right?

159
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,550
I'm sorry.
I'm extra emotional.

160
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,720
I just... the assassination
going sideways,

161
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,890
and then Josh and Eliot
and Julia not making it back.

162
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:58,560
Not to mention all that
crazy stuff Plover told us.

163
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,500
It's just...

164
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:01,460
It's really overwhelming.

165
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,030
So, um, what have you guys
been up to?

166
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,790
- No, no.
- No, no.

167
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,110
Okay, okay, okay.

168
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,940
Josh, Josh, calm, calm.

169
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,610
You are in...

170
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:53,120
Taker Home Base Land,
I guess? Or...

171
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,250
never fear.
No reason to fear

172
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,220
because Taker Kryptonite
for some reason.

173
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,220
Focus.
Mission, get home.

174
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,830
Also don't die.

175
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,900
When you were lost
at "Burning Man,"

176
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,870
what did you do?
You...

177
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,700
called Margo.

178
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,710
Voldemort's clit.

179
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,210
- Wait, where's Josh?
- Where the Takers come from.

180
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,050
- I don't understand.
- Is it in Fillory?

181
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,980
Sure as shit
doesn't look like it.

182
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,550
So then why is Josh there?

183
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,150
No clue, but seems stuck,
wandering around.

184
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,560
And it's, it's...

185
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:35,660
Stop moving
the damn camera, Josh.

186
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,860
It's like I'm watching
"Cloverfield."

187
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,560
I really don't think my eye

188
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,200
likes being in a different
world than me.

189
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,870
Is that my blood?

190
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,640
- Oh, God.
- Margo.

191
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:52,840
Um, hey, not an expert,
but does that seem...

192
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,180
Real goddamn bad.

193
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,640
Is there a spell or something

194
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,010
to calm fairy eyes transmitting
from foreign realms?

195
00:09:59,050 --> 00:09:59,920
Even assuming yes,

196
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:01,820
casting's ultra
moon-jacked today.

197
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:02,890
I can't say I'd risk it.

198
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,720
I have an idea.

199
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,730
- Is she trying to do magic?
- Mm-hmm.

200
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,760
Should you tell her
that's a waste of time?

201
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,100
- Should I?
- It seems like it's helping.

202
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:18,270
Hmm?

203
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,500
Hey, uh, a gentle reminder:

204
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,210
this is a magic-proof cell,
so...

205
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,310
the hedge-witch-explosive
arts and crafts

206
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,980
are at best wishful thinking.

207
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:32,210
And you didn't think
to tell me that 45 minutes ago?

208
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,880
It seemed like
you needed an activity.

209
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,950
I'm honestly trying to help.

210
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,850
It's bad enough for me,

211
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,790
and I don't even have
a human inside me.

212
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,730
Except you do, technically.

213
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,060
Shit.

214
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,060
Now there's nothing to do.

215
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,100
I really let it go on
as long as I felt morally able.

216
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,130
What are we going to do, Eliot?

217
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:53,740
We'll think of something?

218
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,900
Is that a question?

219
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:58,240
I am trying my best
to calm you down...

220
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,310
Calm me down?

221
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,780
What am I,
a maiden with the vapors?

222
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,650
- You're upset...
- I'm not upset.

223
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,850
I'm locked in a dungeon during
Red fucking Monkey month

224
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,820
with this baby growing
inside me like a weed on HGH,

225
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:11,250
on a planet without so much
as a fucking prenatal vitamin.

226
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,160
But no, I'm not upset.
I don't get upset.

227
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:14,190
I figure it out.

228
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,260
There is always something.

229
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:20,760
- Is there?
- Of course there is.

230
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,970
- I agree.
- Do you?

231
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,900
Do you actually believe that?

232
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,640
Um...

233
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,176
I can't believe
I thought I could fix this.

234
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,340
I'm the reason we're here
in the first place.

235
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,980
- Hey.
- No.

236
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:37,150
- I wouldn't say that...
- Face it, I failed, Eliot.

237
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,780
You didn't fail,
you're just tired.

238
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:41,580
You're cooped up...

239
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,826
I stole a quest, I got it wrong.

240
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:45,890
I screwed magic on Earth,
I screwed us here.

241
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,360
And the thing about it is,
you know,

242
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,230
facing ever increasing bad odds

243
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,466
is that you have to be
really good

244
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,860
at thinking
of the next thing to try.

245
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,000
Hey, let's just
take a deep breath, okay?

246
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,070
We'll just...

247
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,306
I mean, there is nothing else.

248
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,970
We are done.

249
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,170
- No.
- We're gonna die here.

250
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,310
My baby is going to die here.
We are gonna die.

251
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,840
- And it all went to shit.
- Hey, hey, hey.

252
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,216
You're just,
you're having a moment...

253
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,210
- This is not a moment.
- It's my life.

254
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,880
You need to calm her.

255
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,420
She's gonna give
the baby bad humors.

256
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:16,850
I just heard a voice
say bad humors?

257
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,490
- You heard that?
- You heard me?

258
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,020
Can you still hear me?
This is wonderful.

259
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,390
- Yeah.
- My name is Charlton.

260
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,190
What the fuck's a Charlton?

261
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,640
So there's a man inside
your head and I heard him?

262
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:35,400
- That's it, more or less.
- An excellent summation.

263
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,340
Why all of a sudden
could I hear him?

264
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:38,410
And then why did it stop?

265
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,710
I don't know.

266
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,380
Well...

267
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:45,210
Her weird baby is developing.

268
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,020
My mother, who was a midwife,

269
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,220
once tended a lady
pregnant by a nixie.

270
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,020
She often sleepwalked

271
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,760
into the sea,
but no ill befell her,

272
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,520
because she developed
gestational gills.

273
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,760
Charlton theorizes that
you had a psychic attack

274
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:00,030
because of, well,

275
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,700
who and what the baby daddy is.

276
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,300
Wait, so you're saying
that's a thing?

277
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:07,200
Me being able to take on
what the baby can do?

278
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,440
Maybe.

279
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:12,370
Well, maybe this baby
is a traveler.

280
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,780
I mean that'd be pretty goddamn
handy right about now, no?

281
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:15,680
Mm-hmm.

282
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,910
Okay, we need
to quantify this shit.

283
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,426
What's happening,
how can I control it,

284
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,350
keep baby safe, and get us
the hell out of here.

285
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,490
- I studied this.
- First year.

286
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,260
They make us take sex ed,

287
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:31,260
inter-magician relations being
so fraught with STIs and peril.

288
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,300
I think we may have
covered this stuff.

289
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,830
You think, or...

290
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,470
I'm not proud, but I was on a...

291
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,500
record amount
of greenhouse cannabis.

292
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,240
And so while technically
I heard every single word,

293
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:45,240
it was all, you know,
Sondheim lyrics.

294
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,940
I was there,
but in a greater sense,

295
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,350
was I there?

296
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,780
Well, perhaps I can help.

297
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,950
If you were, as you say, there,

298
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,450
perhaps the remembrance
itself is...

299
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,990
Is intact in here still
somehow, that is brilliant.

300
00:13:59,020 --> 00:13:59,820
Can you go...
Yeah, I can

301
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,120
certainly attempt.

302
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,460
My imaginary friend is on it.

303
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,590
Great.

304
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,460
"Dos and don'ts

305
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,470
of magical intercourse."

306
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,270
I avoided real college

307
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,040
so I wouldn't have
to see shit like this.

308
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:17,140
- You kidding?
- This is spank bank material.

309
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:20,310
If it burns when you pee,

310
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,040
infirmary.

311
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,450
Red bumps like a curse,

312
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,150
see a nurse.

313
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,250
Scales, feathers, furs...

314
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,220
Medical attention
that rhymes with fur,

315
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,220
read you loud and clear.

316
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,290
Now, let's chat
procreation, shall we?

317
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,130
Let's start with some basics.

318
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,160
Do not assume

319
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:39,960
that your classmate is human

320
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,400
just because they look it.
Hybrids abound.

321
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:46,170
DNA magic develops in utero

322
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,340
which can affect
the mother unpredictably,

323
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,540
which can, of course,
result in maiming

324
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:52,340
or death.

325
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,686
If you think you've
been impregnated

326
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:56,410
by a hybrid or creature,

327
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,250
you may want to take precautions

328
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,050
to prevent any episodes.

329
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:02,990
Let's go over a few, shall we?

330
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,150
Excuse me, wait,
I have questions.

331
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:07,160
Who are you?

332
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,020
You are not a student here.

333
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,860
Of course I am.

334
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:13,560
I did a thing to my face.
Hello, it's...

335
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,000
Todd.

336
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,170
Todd.

337
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,030
Yes, what's your question?

338
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:21,340
What if a person
wanted the episodes?

339
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:26,070
Let's say the fetus was
psychic, or even a traveler.

340
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,540
I cannot speak to that.

341
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,280
Well, but you are
speaking to that.

342
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:31,150
This is a memory.

343
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,120
I made no mention
of travelers specifically.

344
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:37,020
Okay, but say
I wanted my baby to...

345
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:39,066
I can only tell you what's
happening in this memory,

346
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:41,360
Todd.
And how to prevent it.

347
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:43,406
- But that won't help me.
- You see, I need to know...

348
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,090
Hey, genius.

349
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:47,200
Why don't you just let him
tell you how to stop it

350
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,930
and do the opposite?

351
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,630
It's a defense mechanism.

352
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,300
The fetus detects
the mother's distress

353
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,240
and reacts protectively.

354
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,440
You freaked the baby out
with your meltdown,

355
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,240
so it psyched you up.

356
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,440
Next?

357
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,526
And this can be avoided
by cultivating a tranquil mind.

358
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,250
Soothing teas, meditation...

359
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,496
Can we just skip to the part
where Julia travels to safety?

360
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,220
Oh, right, then she'll need to

361
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:11,150
aggressively do the opposite.

362
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,566
The opposite
of tea and meditation?

363
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,960
Wait, is he saying
I need to freak out more?

364
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:17,330
She needs to feel imminent
life or death danger, yes.

365
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:20,730
Basically.

366
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,630
We need to scare
the living shit out of you.

367
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,630
Great.

368
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,340
- This is fine.
- Totally fine.

369
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,240
Just a totally normal walk

370
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,610
through a totally normal forest.

371
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,420
You can't hear that,
but that is a Taker

372
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,590
screaming for some reason.

373
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,490
Whose eye is that?

374
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,120
Nobody's.
It's...

375
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,330
My girlfriend's eye.

376
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,430
That's not better, you know?

377
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,500
She lent it to me.

378
00:16:54,530 --> 00:16:56,270
Where did you come from?

379
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,140
How about that?
So did I.

380
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,446
So how did you end up down here?

381
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,810
I was taken with my friends.

382
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,140
- Friends.
- Friends are good.

383
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,140
Uh, where are they?

384
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:11,380
The Takers put them
in a big, shiny cave.

385
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,020
It opens sideways.

386
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,480
And when you poke
its big, yellow eye,

387
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,150
its mouth opens
and says "ding."

388
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,660
That sounds like an elevator.

389
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,120
Is that a kind of monster?

390
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,190
- No, not a monster.
- A machine.

391
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,360
That eats people?

392
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:28,330
No, it goes up, it goes down.

393
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,130
It's just weird that it's here.

394
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,546
Maybe we should check it out.
Do you know where...

395
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,570
- Are you an adult?
- Of course.

396
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,170
Do I not seem like an adult?

397
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,510
Adults lie and say
everything's okay

398
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,680
when it really isn't.

399
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,380
Then Takers come.

400
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,010
I'm not helping an adult.

401
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:46,150
- Oh, please.
- No.

402
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,820
God, just wait!

403
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,520
No, wait! No!

404
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,350
No, don't touch.
Let me go.

405
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,690
- No, let me go.
- Hey.

406
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,190
- No, no, no!
- Hey.

407
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,760
Uh, you like this?

408
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,760
Yeah, shiny, right?

409
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,560
Yeah, good.
Go get it.

410
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,870
Hey, hey, hey, you okay?

411
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,540
- Yeah.
- How did you do that?

412
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:09,740
- Luck.
- Let's get the hell out of here.

413
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,680
That'll do it.

414
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:16,710
My own personal Mar-Go-Pro.

415
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,556
Trust me, where I'm from,
that was really clever.

416
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,080
Well, here it's stupid, okay?

417
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,390
Now here's the cave over there,
okay?

418
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,290
- Okay.
- Looks clear.

419
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,690
Let's get a little closer
and see where it goes.

420
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,230
Come on.
Shh.

421
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,740
- Underworld?
- Do we not want to go there?

422
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,140
Uh...

423
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,850
Underworld sounds
pretty good right now.

424
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,080
- Come on.
- Come on!

425
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,420
Oh!

426
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,220
Not today, Takers.

427
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,490
But where are we going?

428
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,570
So this is the Underworld?

429
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,310
And it's where we go
when we die?

430
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,780
Does this mean we're dead?

431
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,480
No, no, we're not.

432
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:32,090
I mean, neither of us died.

433
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,120
Technically, so...

434
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,790
Are my friends dead?

435
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:40,130
Look.

436
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,660
I don't know.

437
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,630
And I'm not gonna lie,
this isn't good.

438
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:47,170
But I promise you

439
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,470
I'm going to whatever I can to
get us both out of here, okay?

440
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,910
You better.

441
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,880
Let's see if we can
find some help.

442
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:05,820
"Welcome, you are dead.
Please take a card."

443
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:09,560
Take a card.

444
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,360
You can read, can't you?

445
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:13,700
Right, question.

446
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:16,900
Where do we go if we...

447
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:19,530
Aren't dead?

448
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,670
If you're here, you're dead.

449
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,810
And if you're dead,
you take a card.

450
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,370
But I'm not dead.

451
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,210
I can't be dead.
Please, mister.

452
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,340
There must be someone
we can talk to.

453
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:32,010
Great, now look
what you've done.

454
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:35,120
I'll see if I can find someone.

455
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,190
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- You okay?

456
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,390
Of course.
I do this all the time.

457
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,860
Crying makes
adults uncomfortable.

458
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:43,390
Not bad.

459
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:45,260
Hoberman?

460
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:47,330
- Penny?
- What the fuck?

461
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,230
What are you doing here?

462
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,486
Remind me why you dragged me
to the Brakebills Lab

463
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:02,340
instead of staying
in our comfortable penthouse?

464
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,586
We had to bring you somewhere

465
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,410
where we could
control circumstances.

466
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,956
Besides, I'm going to have to
rely on Kady to do any casting.

467
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,890
I don't even know what to start.

468
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,220
Trash can.

469
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,890
- Oh. Okay.
- What?

470
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,390
That I can handle.

471
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,270
I can see the tether
between you and your eye

472
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,830
and it's kind of between worlds.

473
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:26,670
It's all glitchy.

474
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,370
I think we should
sever the connection

475
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,910
before it does permanent damage.

476
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,410
My fairy eye is the only
connection I have to Josh.

477
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,850
You cut that out,
I cut out your uterus.

478
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,680
- Uh, Margo?
- Just a gentle observation.

479
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,950
If you scorch your brain pan,

480
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,590
that won't be great
for Josh either.

481
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,960
Okay.

482
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:52,460
Okay.

483
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:53,430
That won't work for long,

484
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,630
so we're gonna need
a solution yesterday.

485
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,730
- Yeah, okay.
- You stay with her.

486
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,700
Fen, come with me.
I'm going to need help.

487
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:10,710
I'm gonna need to get
a couple other things stat.

488
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,880
I can only bring
authorized items.

489
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,750
Well...

490
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,550
Then ask a doctor
about premature labor.

491
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,290
And get it authorized.

492
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,460
Now.

493
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:24,430
Ow.

494
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,500
Five stalks green nightshade,

495
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:30,570
one dead quail unplucked,
rock salt,

496
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,800
and two fingers of bourbon.
Now.

497
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,640
- Ow, ow.
- It really hurts.

498
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:36,610
Ask the king if he wants
this woman to die.

499
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,140
I need to cast something
to stop her pain.

500
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:42,410
Or alternately, oceans
of blood on your hands, friend.

501
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,310
Chop chop.

502
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,550
Hey. Psst.

503
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,620
Okay, so what's
all that really for?

504
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:52,420
I need you scared,
and you don't scare easy.

505
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,860
So the less you know,
the better.

506
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,630
Gruel?

507
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,460
Hey, you think Ash will be fine

508
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,770
with, uh, what's-her-name,
right?

509
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,430
Kathy?

510
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,600
Old friend.
She's great with kids.

511
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,440
Should feel like recess
plus birthday.

512
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,810
It's just me and the kid
kind of have this

513
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,780
Newt and Ripley thing going.
I promised I'd get her home.

514
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:22,420
Then I should get
the bad news out of the way.

515
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:25,450
- I can't help you.
- Why the hell not?

516
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:26,960
Take a look around.

517
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,090
Librarians have been going
through some shit lately.

518
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,130
No magic, too much magic,
but unpredictable.

519
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,960
A lot of our folks
got relocated, and we...

520
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,800
Kind of don't exactly
know where.

521
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,540
Okay, perfect world,

522
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:43,040
boss steps in, oversees shit.

523
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:44,970
But...

524
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:48,740
Hades is vanished.

525
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,480
Your boss is the god, Hades?

526
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,980
That's cool,

527
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:55,380
except for
the abandoning you part.

528
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,320
I can't say that's great.

529
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,990
Kind of skeleton crew.

530
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,720
And here's the bad news for you.

531
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,430
Our connection to the world
of the living?

532
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,460
Hades controls that.

533
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:07,730
And right before he FO'd,
he flipped the switch.

534
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,030
Why?

535
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,040
Man, dead you is
just way more zen.

536
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:18,110
So after all that,
why did you stay?

537
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,880
I make a promise, I keep it.

538
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:23,580
Look, bro, I hear you
and bad timing.

539
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,550
But me and the kid?
We didn't die.

540
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,850
We just got dragged
into a weird netherworld

541
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:30,520
- by the Takers.
- Right, you said.

542
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:31,550
Never heard of them.

543
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:34,020
Well, I promise you
they're real and they suck.

544
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,120
And we are in the wrong place.

545
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,530
I mean, this can't be
the first time in history

546
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,860
not dead people
ended up here, right?

547
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,330
Accidents happen.

548
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,870
There's got to be some protocol

549
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,770
or some special
dispensation thing.

550
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,700
Anyone sent
to the Underworld by mistake

551
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:50,910
has 24 hours to file a dispute.

552
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,770
Great, let's file a dispute.

553
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:56,680
Disputes have to be sent up top.

554
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:59,080
And since Hades left, we can't.

555
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:03,080
So if we don't find Hades,
we're just stuck?

556
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,620
I'm sorry.

557
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:08,990
Does he have, like,
a pager or a walkie?

558
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,390
If he doesn't want
to be found, he won't be.

559
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:13,500
The Underworld is big.

560
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:14,700
He could be anywhere.

561
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:18,770
Well could I maybe get a map
and start checking things off?

562
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,500
Shit.

563
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:26,670
I might know someone
who can help.

564
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:30,150
God, but it is the suck option.

565
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:37,590
Penny, you got my invite.

566
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,950
Uh...

567
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:41,660
Oh, you need something.

568
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:43,090
Sorry, man.

569
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,660
This is so typical.

570
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:47,960
You don't come to my brunches,
which I guess is fine,

571
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,500
but you could at least RSVP.

572
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:52,670
That is the polite thing to do

573
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,940
so he doesn't have
too much food.

574
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,140
That makes sense.

575
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,880
Anyway, we need an expert.

576
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,110
That is why we're here.

577
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,780
And I gather you are the guy
who knows where everything is.

578
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,650
Well, I do know a thing or two.

579
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:12,050
And I am very generous
with my time,

580
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:13,250
unlike some people.

581
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:15,660
We are looking for Hades.

582
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:17,560
Penny thinks you might know
where he is.

583
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,860
I have no idea.

584
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,800
Penny told you
he disappeared, right?

585
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:21,660
Very odd.

586
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,630
Usually there's
at least one person

587
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:25,530
who can get a hold of him.
This time...

588
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:27,570
But you know all his spots?

589
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,140
- Gods no.
- Quite the opposite.

590
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:32,810
He is insanely strict on me.

591
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:36,210
You know, I'm not even allowed
to map the place where he...

592
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,880
Wait a minute.

593
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:43,520
He forbade me from mapping
an area in the Underworld.

594
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:46,720
I always suspected he had some
kind of special retreat there.

595
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,820
I'm sorry, if it's
not on the map,

596
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,660
what good would that do us?

597
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:52,666
Well, because I mapped
everything else around it.

598
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:57,200
So in an ironic way, it's
like I mapped it... perfectly.

599
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:08,210
Is it time to put
another scratch mark up?

600
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,250
It's been a day,

601
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,850
right?

602
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,850
I can't tell anymore.

603
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:16,220
I think your count is short.

604
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:19,250
We've been here
longer than a month.

605
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:21,890
This whole conversation
is predicated

606
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,590
on time having meaning,

607
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:26,860
which it doesn't in here, so.

608
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:32,630
A time traveler walks
into a bar in Vienna, 1908.

609
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:37,610
Sits next to a young
art student named Adolf Hitler.

610
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,710
Adolf sighs into his beer.

611
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,110
"You know what I hate?"
he asks.

612
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,650
Time traveler says,

613
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:48,050
"I don't know, Jews?"

614
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,720
And Hitler goes,
"Huh, now that you mention it."

615
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,560
I mean, you got to laugh, right?

616
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,590
You're right.

617
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,830
There are no good jokes
about time traveling.

618
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:02,060
At first, I thought
it was better at least

619
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,230
that we don't get hungry
or tired or need to pee.

620
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:08,270
But it's just...
Fucking torture.

621
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:12,540
- The sameness.
- It is intolerable.

622
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:16,980
- Hey, hey, hey.
- We are tolerating fine.

623
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:18,750
Hey, we are going
to figure this out.

624
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,650
There is nothing to figure out.

625
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,650
It is what it is.

626
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:29,420
There is just one decision.

627
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,290
I'd still be a regular traveler.

628
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:33,090
No, that's not happening.

629
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:36,360
- This is it, Penny.
- The Chatwin curse.

630
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,270
The tipping of the scale.

631
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,170
No, this is just some
self-important asshole

632
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,770
we need to outsmart.

633
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,770
I'm not letting you
be forced into a decision

634
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:44,940
that's gonna ruin your life.

635
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:46,440
It's not my life
exactly, it's...

636
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:48,340
You don't know what it is.

637
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:52,310
You are at the beginning.
That's why, no.

638
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:56,320
We could be here forever

639
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,850
if we don't do something.

640
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:05,160
- What are you doing?
- I'm making my decision.

641
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,900
Wow.

642
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:46,830
The Underworld is in shambles,
and Hades is out here doing...

643
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:50,240
Whatever this is?

644
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,070
Pink Himalayan sea salt.

645
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:55,740
I do a great salt-crusted cod
with a lovely...

646
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,910
You know what, never mind.
Not important.

647
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:59,656
He uses it as a spa bath. It
extracts toxins.

648
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,820
It's a great stress releaser
if you...

649
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:03,890
- So I've heard.
- Excuse me.

650
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,420
This temple is off limits.

651
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,320
- Yes, hi.
- We are looking for Hades.

652
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,890
He's unavailable.

653
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,790
Respectfully,

654
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,830
we wouldn't come here
if it wasn't urgent.

655
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:14,330
Can you please let him know
that we are here?

656
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,030
No, he's gone.

657
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,270
Well, he can't just be gone.

658
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,200
I assume you're here
because he just up and left.

659
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,340
And you're worried
it was for good.

660
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:25,010
Well, I'm sorry to tell you,

661
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:27,040
when he left, he told me
he might never be back.

662
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,680
- Wait, what?
- Never?

663
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:30,450
He didn't feel like elaborating.

664
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,510
It's just some of us

665
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,726
are trying to keep
the Underworld running.

666
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:35,850
Yeah, and some of us
are trying to map it.

667
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,690
And he is a god.

668
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,420
He doesn't answer to any of you.

669
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:41,690
- Well, excuse me, please...
- Uh, guys?

670
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,390
I think I got something.

671
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:47,360
Let's just hope
Margo's still watching.

672
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:51,200
So here's the plan.

673
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:53,900
We separate the signal
before it enters Margo's brain

674
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:54,770
and then we deflect it.

675
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,240
- Like put it somewhere else?
- How?

676
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,310
With this.

677
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:02,310
Now, I have a mixed history
with prism spells,

678
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,480
so you're going to need
to check my math.

679
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:08,320
This feels weird as fuck.

680
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:10,250
Just don't move.

681
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,050
Did you... did you poke
her brain parts?

682
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:14,390
What?

683
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,590
How does that feel?

684
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:18,530
Like you just stuck a
flash drive into my jello hole.

685
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:22,860
Oh, my God.

686
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,076
I feel something coming through.

687
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:27,100
What the fuck?

688
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:30,440
Oh, channel Josh is live.

689
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:32,010
How does it feel?

690
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,240
Like I'm getting acupuncture
inside my brain,

691
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,280
but it doesn't hurt.

692
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:38,010
Well, thank God he's alive.

693
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:41,050
Except where
the shitfaced Jesus is he?

694
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,490
Wait,
why is Penny in Taker Land?

695
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,350
That's not... that's
not that Penny.

696
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:49,090
That's... that's Penny.
That's my Penny.

697
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,430
But that would mean
that Josh is in the Underworld.

698
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,036
- No, no, no, no, no.
- That would mean...

699
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,160
Josh is dead?

700
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,830
Maybe he's trying to tell us
that he's still alive

701
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:00,740
and needs our help.

702
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:05,040
But I don't get it.
Isn't Hades down there?

703
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:08,880
I am so confused.

704
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:12,010
An address! In Queens!

705
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:14,180
- Hades is on Earth?
- Well, shit, go check.

706
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:17,390
I'd come with, but I've got
a goddamn movie projector

707
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,190
stuck in my eye hole.

708
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:23,160
Okay, now arrange
the feathers in front of you

709
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:26,860
in a triangle,
and then drink this.

710
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:28,060
What's the bourbon for?

711
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,830
It's for me.

712
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,340
Ugh.

713
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,970
Okay, so, um, this isn't
going to do anything

714
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:40,580
to you or mini you physically.

715
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:45,050
But, um, you will feel a huge
shot of fear and anxiety,

716
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,310
and it's not gonna be nice.

717
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:48,220
So hopefully that'll
do something.

718
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,280
Okay, bottoms up.

719
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,560
Now listen to exactly
what I'm going to say

720
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:58,560
because the next part
can get a little bit, um...

721
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,330
Weird.

722
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,560
Okay, on my count.

723
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,200
Three, two...

724
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,600
What?

725
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,670
Oh, my God.
My water just broke.

726
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:13,910
- What?
- That's very bad.

727
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,356
Oh, my God,
the baby's coming, Eliot.

728
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,840
Tell her to lay on her back.

729
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,150
- I can't lay on back.
- It's coming.

730
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,880
It's too soon.
This is way too soon.

731
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,556
Eliot, please, do something.
You have to get a guard.

732
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,050
- Guard!
- They won't come.

733
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:25,426
- They never come between meals.
- Oh, shit.

734
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:26,350
I'm sorry.

735
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:28,090
Eliot, you have
to get us out of here.

736
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,260
- I can't.
- Tell the baby.

737
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:32,430
- Okay.
- Okay, baby, we got to go.

738
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,690
We got to go.
Okay, baby?

739
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:36,100
We got to go.
Oh, we got to go.

740
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:37,600
Okay, how does Penny travel?

741
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:40,200
He pictures it
in his mind, right?

742
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:42,300
Right, okay, so picture it
in your mind.

743
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,240
Picture the other side
of the bars.

744
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,710
- I'm trying.
- I can't.

745
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,940
Now, Julia.

746
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:48,310
- I'm trying, El.
- I can't.

747
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,080
- Come on, Jules.
- Now.

748
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,480
Oh, my God.

749
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,720
Eliot, I did it.
It worked.

750
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,220
- Yes.
- Okay, now do it for real.

751
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,950
What?

752
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:00,690
I'm sorry.

753
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,490
You motherfucker.

754
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:08,160
You incepted me.

755
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,600
Your baby's strong.

756
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,170
It took three castings
to deceive it.

757
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,246
I had to make you believe it,

758
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:14,176
so we had to tell you
the spell was something else.

759
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,246
Honestly, fuck the both of you.

760
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:18,310
- Get mad later.
- Use the adrenaline right now.

761
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,440
Do it again.

762
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,910
- Now, Julia.
- Go to hell.

763
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:34,160
My baby is awesome.

764
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,590
Celebrate later, escape now.

765
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:38,330
Keys.

766
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,390
Right.

767
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:52,170
Alice, Kady.

768
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,640
Been expecting you.

769
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,560
So did you come here to watch
me play video games or what?

770
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:10,160
Our friend is trapped
in the Underworld

771
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,330
but he isn't dead.

772
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,630
Wow, how did
he manage to do that?

773
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:17,670
Well, he's gifted
at screwing up.

774
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,400
Can you please help him?

775
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:21,540
Sorry, can't.

776
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:23,640
- Of course you can.
- You run the Underworld.

777
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:25,740
I did, but then I quit.

778
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:27,540
- You what?
- Can you even do that?

779
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,680
I can do what I want.

780
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,750
But why?

781
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:33,350
Our friend,
he's not supposed to be there.

782
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,220
You think death is fair?

783
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:37,120
You think life is fair?

784
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:39,720
Skip the sales pitch,
Kady Orloff-Diaz.

785
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:42,760
I know your life,
so I know you know better.

786
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:46,430
Give me one reason you deserve
to be treated any better

787
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:49,830
than the rest of us,
and I'll help.

788
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,370
Otherwise, you're
messing up my game.

789
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:58,540
What is wrong with him?

790
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:01,380
Why is every god we meet
such a nutsack?

791
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:05,550
Look around.

792
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,350
What do you see?

793
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,620
A shitty apartment?

794
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,420
Shades drawn,

795
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:18,360
take-out, he's a mess.

796
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:20,260
Look familiar?

797
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,600
It's me after Q died.

798
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,240
Oh, my God.

799
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,280
Our Lady Underground
was his wife.

800
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:37,240
And the monster's sister,
she killed her.

801
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,920
The God of the Dead
is in mourning.

802
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,920
Let me try to talk to him.

803
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:52,590
Figured it out, huh?

804
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:56,460
Can you just put that down
and talk to me for a second?

805
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:03,700
Look.

806
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,140
There's nothing to say.

807
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:09,680
It's not the same,
your grief and mine.

808
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:12,610
- I disagree.
- I think when you lose someone...

809
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:13,780
When you die,

810
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:15,650
you go somewhere.

811
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,890
You know how I know?
'Cause I built it.

812
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,150
For you.
To help you.

813
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:23,090
Quentin?
Penny?

814
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,360
I eased their passage.

815
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:30,130
There's no Underworld for gods.

816
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,800
What happens to you?

817
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:34,370
I don't know.

818
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,710
We're not supposed to die,
but...

819
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:43,810
she did, and...

820
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,350
that's all I get to know.

821
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,720
Forever.

822
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:51,890
See, you'll die someday.

823
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,320
But I won't.

824
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,660
I'm sorry.

825
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,900
I wish there was something
I could say to help.

826
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:07,670
Our friend, Josh, didn't die.

827
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:10,300
He was in the Taker Realm, and...

828
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,810
Well, that's not possible.

829
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,180
That place doesn't connect
to the world above.

830
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:16,340
Well, someone opened a door.

831
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,310
That's very bad.

832
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:21,650
The creatures you call Takers,
do you know what they are?

833
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:25,750
They're guard dogs.

834
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:27,690
Their realm is
a security measure.

835
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:30,690
A barrier between your world
and the world of the dead.

836
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,660
If a soul tries to come back,
it takes them

837
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:36,030
and returns them
to the Underworld.

838
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,230
Trust me.

839
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,506
The dead coming back
to the living,

840
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:39,530
that's not a good thing.

841
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:41,570
So if they're in Fillory?

842
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,000
Then somebody opened a door

843
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,740
that should not
have been opened.

844
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:47,580
And I think I know why.

845
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:49,580
What if it was a person like us,

846
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:53,550
who just wanted to bring back
someone he loved?

847
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,790
I leave for a couple months,
and everything goes to shit.

848
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,530
I will help your friend.

849
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,630
But you will clean up this mess.

850
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:11,730
Stop whoever's trying
to get past the Takers.

851
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:14,870
If you don't, and let me
say this very clearly,

852
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,570
your world will be
destroyed too.

853
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:19,310
Destroyed how?

854
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:21,740
If this person were
to get past the Takers,

855
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,280
there would be just one door

856
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:25,450
between them and the person
that they lost.

857
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,750
And if they were
to crack that door,

858
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:31,720
who knows how many of the dead
would spill through.

859
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:34,890
Not just the one he wants,

860
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,460
but all the dead.

861
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:41,030
It could mean
the end of everything.

862
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,880
I think we're back.

863
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,050
Fillory smells a lot
better than Takerville.

864
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:13,390
I didn't think
you were a hugger.

865
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:14,760
Shut up.

866
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,440
Look.

867
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:36,580
- Oh, my God.
- They're all dead.

868
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:40,960
Is that a good thing?

869
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:42,560
I don't know.

870
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:53,800
Okay, we should stop.

871
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:54,800
It's okay.

872
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,640
I can do this.

873
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:00,340
Okay. All right, come here.

874
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:06,610
He said this was
eradicating your...

875
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:09,050
Timey wimey plasma factor.

876
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,650
Why does it look like
this is collecting it?

877
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:14,660
- What?
- Let me see that.

878
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:15,990
Your hand is shaking.

879
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,660
I don't want this.
Get this thing off.

880
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:23,460
- What the hell is it now?
- Step away from her.

881
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,570
This is how you
unburden her curse?

882
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,170
By collecting it?

883
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,500
You don't understand
what you're talking about.

884
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:31,670
Put that down.

885
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:34,680
- How about I smash it?
- Wait.

886
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:35,840
Stop.
Okay.

887
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,180
- Your hand.
- That tremor.

888
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:40,750
That's what happens
when you run low?

889
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,680
Your finite supply?

890
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,990
Do you ever stop
asking questions?

891
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:48,060
You're not a guardian
of space-time.

892
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:49,690
You're a junkie.

893
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,560
I wasn't lying...

894
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:53,190
You used the signal to find us

895
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:55,730
so you can take what we have
to use for yourself.

896
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:58,430
I wasn't lying about what I do.

897
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:00,530
Time travelers are so rare.

898
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:03,170
But you spend your life
chasing them to unflap

899
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,510
every butterfly wing, it feels
like they're everywhere.

900
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:08,610
I'm just trying to stop idiots

901
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,880
from destroying
the entire universe.

902
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:12,880
Oh, it's interesting that idiots

903
00:42:12,910 --> 00:42:14,750
include everyone except you.

904
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,920
Tell me most people
can be trusted.

905
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:19,920
Tell me more power
makes people better.

906
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:22,590
No?
I thought so.

907
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:28,760
I have been keeping
this whole thing together,

908
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,660
by myself, forever.

909
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:33,100
You didn't think
you could ask me for help?

910
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:34,600
Oh, I tried a few times

911
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,470
with a few of you
when I was your age.

912
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,410
I believed in people.

913
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,156
You mean back before
you thought you were better

914
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,980
than everyone else?

915
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:45,780
You can't understand
unless you've seen what I have.

916
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:47,750
And I wouldn't wish that
on the devil.

917
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:50,080
It's why I put you here.

918
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,620
One day, maybe you'll
know enough to thank me.

919
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:54,490
- Okay, brass tacks.
- We're leaving.

920
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,590
- When she finishes...
- I won't.

921
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:57,590
She's not finishing.

922
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:00,560
She's walking away
with whatever's in her veins

923
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:03,030
in exchange for this.

924
00:43:05,570 --> 00:43:08,640
- I can't let her go if she...
- That's the deal.

925
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:13,970
Fine.

926
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:19,580
Learn not to time travel.

927
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:21,280
Because hear me.

928
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:24,250
If you go back,
if you change a hair on a fly,

929
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,120
you will be seeing me.

930
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:30,160
And it will be the very
last time you see anyone.

931
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,990
Can't wait.

932
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,570
Hey, help!

933
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,670
- Okay, she's breathing.
- She's coming to.

934
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:46,570
Oh.

935
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,980
Yeah, uh,

936
00:43:51,010 --> 00:43:53,780
we should probably talk.
