doesn't look like it.

stuck, wandering around.

288
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,787

293
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:32,670
but I was on a record amount
of greenhouse cannabis,

294
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:35,271
and so, while technically
I heard every single word,

295
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:38,108
it was all, you know,
Sondheim lyrics.

296
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:41,114
I was there, but
in a greater sense,

297
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:43,387
was I there?

298
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:44,856
Well, perhaps I can help.

299
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,024
If you were, as
you say, "there,"

300
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:49,823
perhaps the
remembrance itself is...

301
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:52,160
Is intact in here still
somehow, that is brilliant.

302
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,164

can certainly attempt.

303
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,469

Now, let's chat
procreation, shall we?

315
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:29,195
Let's start with some basics.

316
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:33,264
Do not assume that
your classmate is human

317
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,705
just because they look it.

318
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,498
Hybrids abound.

319
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,210
DNA magic develops <i>in utero,</i>

320
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,571
which can affect the
mother unpredictably,

321
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:44,708
which can, of course,
result in maiming or death.

322
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:49,545
If you think you've been
impregnated by a hybrid or creature,

323
00:14:49,856 --> 00:14:51,347
you may want to take precautions

324
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:54,222
to prevent any episodes.

325
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,295
Let's go over a few, shall we?

326
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,058
Excuse me, wait,
I have questions.

327
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:02,166
Who are you? You
are not a student here.

328
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:05,728
Of course I am. I... I
did a thing to my face.

329
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,034
Hello, it's Todd.

330
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,834
Todd.

331
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,173
Yes, what's your question?

332
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,476
What if a person
wanted the episodes?

333
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:18,741
Let's say the fetus was
psychic, or even a Traveler?

334
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:20,750
I cannot speak to that.

335
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,651
Well, but you are
speaking to that.

336
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,314
This is a memory.

337
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,325
I made no mention of
Travelers specifically.

338
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:30,051
Okay, but say I
wanted my baby...

339
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:33,293
I can only tell you what's
happening in this memory, Todd,

340
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,560
and how to prevent it.

341
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:36,712
Yeah, but that won't help
me. You see, I need to know...

342
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,136
MARGO: Hey, genius,

343
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:41,502
why don't you just let him tell you
how to stop it and do the opposite?

344
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:46,121
CHARLTON: It's a
defense mechanism.

345
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:48,665
The fetus detects the mother's
distress and reacts protectively.

521
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,582
Except for the
abandoning you part.

522
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:48,225
Can't say that's great.

523
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:50,452
Kind of a skeleton crew.

524
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:52,929
And here's the bad news for you.

525
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,825
Our connection to the world of
the living, Hades controls that.

526
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:58,928
And right before he
FO'd, he flipped the switch.

527
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:00,263
Why?

528
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,940
(SIGHS)

529
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:06,040
Man, dead you is
just way more zen.

530
00:24:06,245 --> 00:24:09,306
Uh, so after all that,
why did you stay?

531
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:12,081
I make a promise, I keep it.

532
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,852
Look, bro, I hear
you, and bad timing,

533
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,923
but me and the
kid, we didn't die.

534
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:19,823
We just got dragged into a
weird netherworld by the Takers.

535
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:21,223
Right, you said.

536
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:23,118
Never heard of 'em.

537
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:25,322
Well, I promise you,
they're real and they suck,

538
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:27,400
and we are in the wrong place.

539
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,692
I mean, this can't be
the first time in history

540
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,328
not-dead people
ended up here, right?

541
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:34,964
Accidents happen. There's
gotta be some protocol.

542
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,833
(STAMMERING) Or some
special dispensation thing.

543
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:42,104
Anyone sent to the Underworld by
mistake has 24 hours to file a dispute.

544
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:44,082
Great! Let's file a dispute.

545
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,983
Disputes have to be sent up top.

546
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:50,013
And since Hades left, we can't.

547
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:54,425
So, if we don't find
Hades, we're just stuck?

548
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:55,786
I'm sorry.

549
00:24:56,028 --> 00:25:00,329
Does he have, like,
a pager or a walkie?

550
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:02,463
If he doesn't want to
be found, he won't be.

551
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:04,300
Underworld is big.

552
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:06,297
He could be anywhere.

553
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:09,536
Well, could I maybe get a map
and start checking things off?

554
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:12,834
Shit.

555
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:17,814
I might know
someone who can help.

556
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:21,385
God, but it is the suck option.

557
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,653
Penny! You got my invite.

558
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,194
Uh...

559
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:31,462
Oh.

560
00:25:32,064 --> 00:25:33,760
You need something. Sorry, man.

561
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:34,866
(SIGHS)

562
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:37,035
This is so typical.

563
00:25:37,136 --> 00:25:39,230
You don't come to my
brunches, which I guess is fine,

564
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:40,738
but you could at least RSVP.

565
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:44,068
(STAMMERS) That
is the polite thing to do,

566
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:46,145
so he doesn't
have too much food.

567
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:50,409
That makes sense.

568
00:25:50,783 --> 00:25:53,184
Anyway, we need an expert.

569
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:54,413
That is why we're here,

570
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:57,957
and I gather you are the guy who
knows where everything is. (CHUCKLES)

571
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:01,358
Well, I do know a thing
or two. (CHUCKLES)

572
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,594
And I am very generous with
my time, unlike some people.

573
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,965
We are looking for Hades.

574
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,762
Penny thinks you
might know where he is.

575
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,096
BENEDICT: I have no idea.

576
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:13,032
Penny told you he
disappeared, right? Very odd.

577
00:26:13,372 --> 00:26:15,852
Usually there's at least one
person that can get a hold of him.

578
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,510
This time... But you
know all his spots?

579
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,443
(CHUCKLES) Gods, no.

580
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:24,079
Quite the opposite. He
is insanely strict on me.

581
00:26:24,183 --> 00:26:26,516
You know, I'm not even allowed
to map the place where he...

582
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,087
Wait a minute.

583
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,450
He forbade me from mapping
an area in the Underworld.

584
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,955
I always suspected he had
some kind of special retreat there.

585
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:41,830
I'm sorry, if it's not on the map,
what good would that do us?

586
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,903
Well, because I mapped
everything else around it.

587
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:48,373
So, in an ironic way, it's
like I mapped it perfectly.

588
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:49,941
(CHUCKLES)

589
00:26:57,249 --> 00:26:59,480
Is it time to put another
scratch mark up?

590
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:02,378
It's been a day, right?

591
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,722
I can't tell anymore.

592
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,022
I think your count is short.

593
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:10,552
We've been here
longer than a month.

594
00:27:11,497 --> 00:27:14,865
This whole conversation is
predicated on time having meaning,

595
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:17,960
which it doesn't in here, so...

596
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:23,733
A Time Traveler walks
into a bar in Vienna, 1908.

597
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:28,740
Sits next to a young art
student named Adolf Hitler.

598
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:31,982
Adolf sighs into his beer.

599
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:34,348
"You know what I hate?" he asks.

600
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:39,422
Time Traveler says,
"I don't know. Jews?"

601
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:44,029
And Hitler goes, "Huh. Now that
you mention it..." (CHUCKLES)

602
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:47,760
I mean, you gotta laugh, right?

603
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:48,994
You're right.

604
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:51,069
There are no good
jokes about time-traveling.

605
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:52,901
At first I thought
it was better,

606
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:56,533
at least, that we don't get
hungry or tired or need to pee,

607
00:27:56,642 --> 00:27:57,769
but it's just...

608
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:59,539
Fucking torture.

609
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:03,047
The sameness, it is intolerable.

610
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:05,208
(WINCING) Hey. Hey, hey.

611
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:07,616
We are tolerating fine.

612
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,878
Hey, we are going
to figure this out.

613
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:12,147
There is nothing to figure out.

614
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,725
It is what it is.

615
00:28:16,228 --> 00:28:18,925
There is just one decision.

616
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,728
I'd still be a regular Traveler.

617
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,325
No, that's not happening.

618
00:28:24,636 --> 00:28:25,695

The... The Chatwin curse.
The tipping of the scale.

00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:32,872
No, this is just some self-important
asshole we need to outsmart.

I am not letting you be forced into
a decision that's gonna ruin your life.

It's not my life,
exactly. It's...

623
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:39,578
You don't know what it is.

624
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:41,643
You are at the beginning.

625
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:43,647
That's why, no.

626
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,358
We could be here forever

627
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:50,027

and Hades is out here doing...

Whatever this is.

00:29:41,046 --> 00:29:42,480

You know what, never
mind. Not important.

639
00:29:48,153 --> 00:29:50,520

bath. It extracts toxins.

Respectfully, we wouldn't
come here if it wasn't urgent.

Can you please let him
know that we are here?

00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:06,204
No. He's gone.

648
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,535
Well, he can't just be gone.

Well, I'm sorry to tell you,

652
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,374

he might never be back.

feel like elaborating.

us are trying to map it!

00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,286
What? Let me see that.

868
00:41:04,062 --> 00:41:06,657
Your hand is shaking. (GROANS)

869
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:08,575
I don't... I don't want
this. Get this thing off.

870
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:09,599
(PENNY GRUNTS)

871
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:12,527
What the hell is it now?
Step away from her.

872
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:15,173
This is how you
unburden her curse?

873
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,474
By collecting it?

874
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:19,782
You don't understand
what you're talking about.

875
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:20,835
Put that down.

876
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:23,304
How about I smash it? Wait!

877
00:41:24,549 --> 00:41:26,108
Stop, okay? Your hand,

878
00:41:26,351 --> 00:41:27,351
that tremor.

879
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,881
That's what happens when
you run low? Your finite supply?

880
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:34,515
Do you ever stop
asking questions?

881
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:37,424
You're not a guardian
of space-time,

882
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:40,329
you're a junkie. I wasn't lying.

883
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:44,835
You used the signal to find us so you
can take what we have to use for yourself.

884
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:47,098
I wasn't lying about what I do.

885
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:49,838
Time Travelers are so rare,

886
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:53,667
but you spend your life chasing
them to unflap every butterfly wing,

887
00:41:53,745 --> 00:41:55,646
it feels like they're
everywhere.

888
00:41:56,047 --> 00:42:00,109
I'm just trying to stop idiots from
destroying the entire universe.

889
00:42:00,685 --> 00:42:03,985
Oh, it's interesting that idiots
include everyone except you.

890
00:42:04,589 --> 00:42:06,182
Tell me most people
can be trusted.

891
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:09,855
Tell me more power
makes people better. No?

892
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:11,919
I thought so.

893
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:19,994
I have been keeping this whole
thing together, by myself, forever.

894
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:22,466
You didn't think you
could ask me for help?

895
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:26,136
Oh, I tried a few times with a
few of you when I was your age.

896
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,607
I believed in people.

897
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:32,150
You mean back before you thought you
were better than everyone else? (SCOFFS)

898
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:35,084
You can't understand unless
you've seen what I have,

899
00:42:35,186 --> 00:42:36,882
and I wouldn't wish
that on the devil.

900
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:39,380
It's why I put you here.

901
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:41,902
One day maybe you'll
know enough to thank me.

902
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:43,588
Okay, brass tacks,
we're leaving.

903
00:42:43,795 --> 00:42:45,923
When she finishes, I... I won't.

904
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,225
PENNY: She's not finishing.

905
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:49,694
She's walking away with
whatever's in her veins

906
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:52,096
in exchange for this.

907
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:57,501
I can't let her go if
she... That's the deal.

908
00:43:00,178 --> 00:43:01,178
(SIGHS)

909
00:43:02,213 --> 00:43:03,213
Fine.

910
00:43:07,385 --> 00:43:08,819
Learn not to Time Travel.

911
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:13,749
Because, hear me, if you go
back, if you change a hair on a fly,

912
00:43:13,825 --> 00:43:15,657
you will be seeing me,

913
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:19,424
and it will be the very
last time you see anyone.

914
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:23,125
Can't wait.

915
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:28,762
PENNY: Hey, help!

916
00:43:32,009 --> 00:43:33,944
KADY: Okay, she's
breathing. She's coming to.

917
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:35,645
JULIA: Um...

918
00:43:38,483 --> 00:43:39,542
Yeah, uh,

919
00:43:40,485 --> 00:43:42,920
we should probably talk.

920
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:43,987
(GASPS SOFTLY)
