I'm sorry.
I'm extra emotional.

179
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,706
I just‐‐the assassination
going sideways,

180
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:55,875
and then Josh and Eliot
and Julia not making it back.

181
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,545
Not to mention all that
crazy stuff Plover told us.

182
00:07:58,578 --> 00:07:59,479
It's just...

183
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,448
It's really overwhelming.

184
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,017
So, um, what have you guys
been up to?

185
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:13,893
[thunder rumbles]

186
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:16,730
‐ [gasping]

187
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:17,998
[grunts]

188
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:21,034
‐ [snarling]

189
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:24,771
‐ No, no.
No, no.

190
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:25,972
[whimpers]

191
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:31,711
‐ [raspy groaning]

192
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:34,113
‐ [grunts]

193
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:40,120
[panting]

194
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,089
Okay, okay, okay.

195
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:45,925
Josh, Josh,
calm, calm.

196
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:47,594
You are in...

197
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:53,099
Taker Home Base Land,
I guess? Or...

198
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,235
never fear.
No reason to fear

199
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:59,205
because Taker Kryptonite
for some reason.

200
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:00,507
[inhales]

201
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,208
Focus.
Mission, get home.

202
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:04,811
Also don't die.

203
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,880
When you were lost
at "Burning Man,"

204
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:09,849
what did you do?
You...

205
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,684
called Margo.

206
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,987
[panting]

207
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,057
‐ [groaning loudly]

208
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,158
[inhales]

209
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:20,693
Voldemort's clit.

210
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:23,196
‐ Wait, where's Josh?
‐ Where the Takers come from.

211
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,031
‐ I don't understand.
Is it in Fillory?

212
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,966
‐ Sure as shit
doesn't look like it.

213
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,535
‐ So then why is Josh there?

214
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,137
‐ No clue, but seems stuck,
wandering around.

215
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:32,539
And it's, it's...

216
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,642
Stop moving
the damn camera, Josh.

217
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,844
It's like I'm watching
"Cloverfield."

218
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:40,547
[sighs]
I really don't think my eye

219
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,158
likes being in a different
world than me.

220
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:43,316
[groans]

221
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:46,186
[gasping]

222
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:48,855
Is that my blood?

223
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:50,623
‐ Oh, God.
‐ Margo.

224
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:52,826
Um, hey, not an expert,
but does that seem‐‐

225
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:54,160
‐ Real goddamn bad.

226
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:55,628
‐ Is there a spell
or something

227
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:58,998
to calm fairy eyes transmitting
from foreign realms?

228
00:09:59,032 --> 00:09:59,899
‐ Even assuming yes,

229
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,801
casting's ultra
moon‐jacked today.

230
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:02,869
I can't say I'd risk it.

231
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:04,170
‐ [whimpers]

232
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:06,706
‐ I have an idea.

233
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,711
‐ Is she trying to do magic?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

234
00:10:11,744 --> 00:10:13,746
‐ Should you tell her
that's a waste of time?

235
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,082
‐ Should I?
It seems like it's helping.

236
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,251
‐ Hmm?

237
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,487
‐ Hey, uh, a gentle reminder:

238
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,190
This is a magic‐proof cell,
so...

239
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:27,293
the hedge‐witch‐explosive
arts and crafts

240
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:28,962
are at best
wishful thinking.

241
00:10:28,995 --> 00:10:32,198
‐ And you didn't think
to tell me that 45 minutes ago?

242
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:34,868
‐ It seemed like
you needed an activity.

243
00:10:34,901 --> 00:10:36,936
I'm honestly trying to help.

244
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:37,837
It's bad enough for me,

245
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:39,772
and I don't even have
a human inside me.

246
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,709
‐ Except you do, technically.

247
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,043
‐ Shit.

248
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:46,045
Now there's nothing to do.

249
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,082
‐ I really let it go on
as long as I felt morally able.

250
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,117
‐ What are we going
to do, Eliot?

251
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,720
‐ We'll think of something?

252
00:10:53,753 --> 00:10:54,888
‐ Is that a question?

253
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:58,224
‐ I am trying my best
to calm you down‐‐

254
00:10:58,258 --> 00:10:59,292
‐ Calm me down?

255
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,760
What am I,
a maiden with the vapors?

256
00:11:00,793 --> 00:11:02,629
‐ You're upset‐‐
‐ [yelling] I'm not upset.

257
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,832
I'm locked in a dungeon during
Red fucking Monkey month

258
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:08,801
with this baby growing
inside me like a weed on HGH,

259
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,237
on a planet without so much
as a fucking prenatal vitamin.

260
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,139
But no, I'm not upset.
I don't get upset.

261
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,140
I figure it out.

262
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:16,376
[inhales and exhales]

263
00:11:16,409 --> 00:11:18,244
There is always something.

264
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:20,747
‐ Is there?
‐ Of course there is.

265
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,949
I agree.
‐ Do you?

266
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:24,884
Do you actually believe that?

267
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:26,619
‐ [exhales]
‐ Um...

268
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:28,164
‐ I can't believe
I thought I could fix this.

269
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:31,324
I'm the reason we're here
in the first place.

270
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,960
‐ Hey.
‐ No.

271
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:37,130
‐ I wouldn't say that‐‐
‐ Face it, I failed, Eliot.

272
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,731
‐ [sighs]

273
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:40,767
You didn't fail,
you're just tired.

274
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,568
You're cooped up‐‐

275
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:42,811
‐ I stole a quest,
I got it wrong.

276
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:45,872
I screwed magic on Earth,
I screwed us here.

277
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,340
And the thing about it is,
you know,

278
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,209
facing ever increasing bad odds

279
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:50,452
is that you have to be
really good

280
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,845
at thinking
of the next thing to try.

281
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,982
‐ Hey, let's just
take a deep breath, okay?

282
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,050
We'll just‐‐

283
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,294
‐ I mean,
there is nothing else.

284
00:11:58,318 --> 00:11:59,953
We are done.

285
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:02,155
‐ [softly] No.
‐ We're gonna die here.

286
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,290
My baby is going to die here.
We are gonna die.

287
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:06,826
And it all went to shit.
‐ Hey, hey, hey.

288
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,204
You're just,
you're having a moment‐‐

289
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,196
‐ This is not a moment.
It's my life.

290
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,864
‐ You need to calm her.

291
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,399
She's gonna give
the baby bad humors.

292
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:16,836
‐ I just heard a voice
say bad humors?

293
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:18,471
‐ You heard that?
‐ You heard me?

294
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,007
Can you still hear me?
This is wonderful.

295
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,375
‐ Yeah.
‐ My name is Charlton.

296
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,177
‐ What the fuck's a Charlton?

297
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,621
‐ So there's a man inside
your head and I heard him?

298
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:35,388
‐ That's it, more or less.
‐ An excellent summation.

299
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,323
‐ Why all of a sudden
could I hear him?

300
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:38,391
And then why did it stop?

301
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,693
‐ I don't know.

302
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:42,362
‐ Well...

303
00:12:42,395 --> 00:12:45,198
Her weird baby is developing.

304
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:47,000
My mother, who was a midwife,

305
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:49,202
once tended a lady
pregnant by a nixie.

306
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:51,004
She often sleepwalked

307
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:52,739
into the sea,
but no ill befell her,

308
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,508
because she developed
gestational gills.

309
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,745
‐ Charlton theorizes that
you had a psychic attack

310
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:00,013
because of, well,

311
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:02,682
who and what the baby daddy is.

312
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,284
‐ Wait, so you're saying
that's a thing?

313
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:07,186
Me being able to take on
what the baby can do?

314
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,421
‐ Maybe.

315
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,358
‐ Well, maybe this baby
is a traveler.

316
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:14,761
I mean that'd be pretty goddamn
handy right about now, no?

317
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,662
‐ Mm‐hmm.

318
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:17,897
‐ Okay, we need
to quantify this shit.

319
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,408
What's happening,
how can I control it,

320
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:21,334
keep baby safe, and get us
the hell out of here.

321
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:24,470
‐ I studied this.
First year.

322
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,239
They make us take sex ed,

323
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:31,244
inter‐magician relations being
so fraught with STIs and peril.

324
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,279
I think we may have
covered this stuff.

325
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,814
‐ You think, or‐‐

326
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,450
‐ I'm not proud,
but I was on a...

327
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,485
record amount
of greenhouse cannabis.

328
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,221
And so while technically
I heard every single word,

329
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:45,224
it was all, you know,
Sondheim lyrics.

330
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:47,927
I was there,
but in a greater sense,

331
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,330
was I there?

332
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:52,765
‐ Well, perhaps I can help.

333
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:54,934
If you were,
as you say, there,

334
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,436
perhaps the remembrance
itself is‐‐

335
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:58,971
‐ Is intact in here still
somehow, that is brilliant.

336
00:13:59,005 --> 00:13:59,806
Can you go‐‐
‐ Yeah, I can

337
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,107
certainly attempt.

338
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,443
‐ My imaginary friend is on it.

339
00:14:03,476 --> 00:14:05,578
‐ Great.

340
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,448
‐ "Dos and don'ts

341
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:10,450
of magical intercourse."

342
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:12,251
‐ I avoided real college

343
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:14,020
so I wouldn't have
to see shit like this.

344
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:17,123
‐ You kidding?
This is spank bank material.

345
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:20,293
‐ If it burns when you pee,

346
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:22,028
infirmary.

347
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:24,430
Red bumps like a curse,

348
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:26,132
see a nurse.

349
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:28,234
Scales, feathers, furs‐‐

350
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,203
‐ Medical attention
that rhymes with fur,

351
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:31,204
read you loud and clear.

352
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:34,273
‐ Now, let's chat
procreation, shall we?

353
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:36,109
Let's start with some basics.

354
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:38,144
[chalkboard squeaks]
Do not assume

355
00:14:38,177 --> 00:14:39,946
that your classmate is human

356
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:43,383
just because they look it.
Hybrids abound.

357
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:46,152
DNA magic develops in utero

358
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:48,321
which can affect
the mother unpredictably,

359
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,523
which can, of course,
result in maiming

360
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,325
or death.

361
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:53,669
If you think you've
been impregnated

362
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:56,396
by a hybrid or creature,

363
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:58,231
you may want
to take precautions

364
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:01,033
to prevent any episodes.

365
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,969
Let's go over a few, shall we?

366
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,138
‐ Excuse me, wait,
I have questions.

367
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:07,140
‐ Who are you?

368
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:09,008
You are not a student here.

369
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,843
‐ Of course I am.

370
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:13,546
I did a thing to my face.
Hello, it's...

371
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,981
Todd.

372
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,150
‐ Todd.

373
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:19,018
Yes, what's your question?

374
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,320
‐ What if a person
wanted the episodes?

375
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:26,058
Let's say the fetus was
psychic, or even a traveler.

376
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:27,527
‐ I cannot speak to that.

377
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,262
‐ Well, but you are
speaking to that.

378
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,130
‐ This is a memory.

379
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:33,099
I made no mention
of travelers specifically.

380
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:37,003
‐ Okay, but say
I wanted my baby to‐‐

381
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:39,047
‐ I can only tell you what's
happening in this memory,

382
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:41,340
Todd.
And how to prevent it.

383
00:15:41,374 --> 00:15:43,376
‐ But that won't help me.
You see, I need to know‐‐

384
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:45,077
‐ Hey, genius.

385
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,180
Why don't you just let him
tell you how to stop it

386
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:49,916
and do the opposite?

387
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,618
‐ It's a defense mechanism.

388
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:54,287
The fetus detects
the mother's distress

389
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,222
and reacts protectively.

390
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:58,424
‐ You freaked the baby out
with your meltdown,

391
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,226
so it psyched you up.

392
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,427
Next?

393
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,505
‐ And this can be avoided
by cultivating a tranquil mind.

394
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,231
Soothing teas, meditation‐‐

395
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,476
‐ Can we just skip to the part
where Julia travels to safety?

396
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,202
‐ Oh, right,
then she'll need to

397
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:11,137
aggressively do the opposite.

398
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,548
‐ The opposite
of tea and meditation?

399
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:14,941
‐ Wait, is he saying
I need to freak out more?

400
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,310
‐ She needs to feel imminent
life or death danger, yes.

401
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:19,245
‐ [sighs]

402
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:20,713
Basically.

403
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,615
We need to scare
the living shit out of you.

404
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,617
‐ Great.

405
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,319
‐ This is fine.
Totally fine.

406
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,221
[Taker growling]
Just a totally normal walk

407
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:29,589
through a totally
normal forest.

408
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:32,692
‐ [shrieking]

409
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:41,400
‐ You can't hear that,
but that is a Taker

410
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,569
screaming for some reason.

411
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:45,471
‐ Whose eye is that?
‐ [screams]

412
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:48,107
Nobody's.
It's...

413
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,309
My girlfriend's eye.

414
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:52,411
‐ That's not better, you know?

415
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,480
‐ She lent it to me.

416
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,249
Where did you come from?

417
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:00,119
How about that?
So did I.

418
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:01,420
So how did you end up
down here?

419
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:03,789
‐ I was taken
with my friends.

420
00:17:03,823 --> 00:17:06,125
‐ Friends.
Friends are good.

421
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:07,126
Uh, where are they?

422
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:11,364
‐ The Takers put them
in a big, shiny cave.

423
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:12,999
It opens sideways.

424
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,468
And when you poke
its big, yellow eye,

425
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:19,138
its mouth opens
and says "ding."

426
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,640
‐ That sounds like an elevator.

427
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:22,108
‐ Is that a kind of monster?

428
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:24,176
‐ No, not a monster.
A machine.

429
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,344
‐ That eats people?

430
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,314
‐ No, it goes up,
it goes down.

431
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:31,117
It's just weird that it's here.

432
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,528
Maybe we should check it out.
Do you know where‐‐

433
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,554
‐ Are you an adult?
‐ Of course.

434
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:37,156
Do I not seem like an adult?

435
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:39,492
‐ Adults lie and say
everything's okay

436
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:40,660
when it really isn't.

437
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:42,361
‐ [sighs]
‐ Then Takers come.

438
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:43,996
I'm not helping an adult.

439
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,132
‐ Oh, please.
No.

440
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:48,801
[groans]
God, just wait!

441
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:50,503
‐ [shrieking]
‐ No, wait! No!

442
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:52,338
No, don't touch.
Let me go.

443
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:53,673
No, let me go.
‐ Hey.

444
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:56,175
‐ [screaming] No, no, no!
‐ Hey.

445
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,743
Uh, you like this?

446
00:17:57,777 --> 00:17:59,745
Yeah, shiny, right?

447
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:01,547
Yeah, good.
Go get it.

448
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:05,851
‐ [panting]
‐ Hey, hey, hey, you okay?

449
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:07,520
‐ Yeah.
How did you do that?

450
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,722
‐ Luck.
Let's get the hell out of here.

451
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:13,659
That'll do it.

452
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:16,696
My own personal Mar‐Go‐Pro.

453
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:18,540
Trust me, where I'm from,
that was really clever.

454
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,066
‐ Well, here it's stupid, okay?

455
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,369
Now here's the cave over there,
okay?

456
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:25,271
‐ Okay.
Looks clear.

457
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,673
Let's get a little closer
and see where it goes.

458
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:30,209
Come on.
Shh.

459
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,514
[ding]

460
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,720
Underworld?
‐ Do we not want to go there?

461
00:18:42,588 --> 00:18:44,123
‐ Uh...

462
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,525
‐ [snarling]

463
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:49,705
‐ Underworld sounds
pretty good right now.

464
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:51,130
‐ [growling]

465
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:53,065
‐ Come on.
Come on!

466
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:55,434
‐ [snarling]

467
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,403
‐ Oh!

468
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,205
Not today, Takers.

469
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:00,406
‐ [sighs]

470
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:03,476
But where are we going?

471
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:06,212
[dramatic music]

472
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:08,381
[elevator dings]

473
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,558
So this is the Underworld?

474
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:22,294
And it's where we go
when we die?

475
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:26,766
Does this mean we're dead?

476
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,467
‐ No, no, we're not.

477
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:32,071
I mean, neither of us died.

478
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:35,107
Technically, so...

479
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:37,777
‐ Are my friends dead?

480
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:40,112
‐ Look.

481
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:41,647
I don't know.

482
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,617
And I'm not gonna lie,
this isn't good.

483
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:47,153
But I promise you

484
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:51,457
I'm going to whatever I can to
get us both out of here, okay?

485
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,892
‐ You better.

486
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:57,863
‐ Let's see if we can
find some help.

487
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:00,933
[classical music playing]

488
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:05,805
"Welcome, you are dead.
Please take a card."

[bell dings]

490
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,542
‐ Take a card.

491
00:20:09,575 --> 00:20:11,343
You can read, can't you?

492
00:20:11,377 --> 00:20:13,679
‐ [chuckles]
Right, question.

493
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:16,882
Where do we go if we...

494
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,518
Aren't dead?

495
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,654
‐ If you're here,
you're dead.

496
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:23,789
And if you're dead,
you take a card.

497
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:25,357
‐ [sniffles]
But I'm not dead.

498
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,193
I can't be dead.
Please, mister.

499
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,328
There must be someone
we can talk to.

500
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:31,997
‐ Great, now look
what you've done.

501
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:35,101
‐ I'll see
if I can find someone.

502
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:37,169
‐ Hey, hey, hey, hey.
You okay?

503
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:38,370
‐ [panting]

504
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,372
Of course.
I do this all the time.

505
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:41,841
Crying makes
adults uncomfortable.

506
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:43,375
‐ Not bad.
‐ [laughs]

507
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,244
‐ Hoberman?

508
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:47,313
‐ Penny?
‐ What the fuck?

509
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:49,215
What are you doing here?

510
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,468
‐ Remind me why you dragged me
to the Brakebills Lab

511
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:02,328
instead of staying
in our comfortable penthouse?

512
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:03,572
‐ We had to bring you somewhere

513
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:05,397
where we could
control circumstances.

514
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,943
Besides, I'm going to have to
rely on Kady to do any casting.

515
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,869
‐ I don't even know
what to start.

516
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:11,203
‐ Trash can.

517
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:12,872
‐ Oh. Okay.
‐ What?

518
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:16,742
‐ [gags, retching]

519
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,377
‐ That I can handle.

520
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,250
‐ I can see the tether
between you and your eye

521
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,818
and it's kind of
between worlds.

522
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:26,652
It's all glitchy.

523
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:29,355
I think we should
sever the connection

524
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:30,890
before it does
permanent damage.

525
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:34,393
‐ My fairy eye is the only
connection I have to Josh.

526
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,829
You cut that out,
I cut out your uterus.

‐ Uh, Margo?
Just a gentle observation.

529
00:21:40,699 --> 00:21:41,934
If you scorch your brain pan,

530
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,569
that won't be great
for Josh either.

531

That won't work for long,

535
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,614
so we're gonna need
a solution yesterday.

536
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,716
‐ Yeah, okay.
You stay with her.

537
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,685
Fen, come with me.
I'm going to need help.

538
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:10,696
‐ I'm gonna need to get
a couple other things stat.

539
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:12,865
‐ I can only bring
authorized items.

540
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:14,733
‐ Well...
‐ [panting]

541
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:17,536
‐ Then ask a doctor
about premature labor.

542
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:19,271
And get it authorized.

543
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:21,440
‐ [whimpering]
‐ Now.

544
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,410
‐ Ow.

545
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:27,479
‐ Five stalks
green nightshade,

546
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:30,549
one dead quail unplucked,
rock salt,

547
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,785
and two fingers of bourbon.
Now.

548
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:34,620
‐ Ow, ow.
It really hurts.

549
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:36,589
‐ Ask the king if he wants
this woman to die.

550
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:39,124
I need to cast something
to stop her pain.

551
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:42,394
Or alternately, oceans
of blood on your hands, friend.

552
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:44,296
Chop chop.

553
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,533
‐ Hey. Psst.

554
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:49,602
Okay, so what's
all that really for?

555
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:52,404
‐ I need you scared,
and you don't scare easy.

556
00:22:52,438 --> 00:22:54,840
So the less you know,
the better.

557

Gruel?

558

will be fine

559

right?

560

561
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:07,586
Old friend.
She's great with kids.

562
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:11,423
Should feel like recess
plus birthday.

563
00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:13,792
‐ It's just me and the kid
kind of have this.

564
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:17,763
Newt and Ripley thing going.
I promised I'd get her home.

565
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:22,401

the bad news out of the way.

566

through some shit lately.

569

but unpredictable.

570

A lot of our folks
got relocated, and we...

571

Kind of don't exactly
know where.

572
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,519
Okay, perfect world,

573
00:23:40,552 --> 00:23:43,022

oversees shit.

574
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:44,957
But...

575
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,727
[sighs]
Hades is vanished.

576
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:51,463

577
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:52,965
That's cool,

578
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:55,367
except for
the abandoning you part.

579
00:23:55,401 --> 00:23:57,303
‐ I can't say that's great.

580
00:23:57,336 --> 00:23:58,971
Kind of skeleton crew.

581
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:01,707
And here's
the bad news for you.

582
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,409
Our connection to the world
of the living?

583
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,443
Hades controls that.

584
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:07,713
And right before he FO'd,
he flipped the switch.

585
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:09,014
‐ Why?

586
00:24:09,048 --> 00:24:11,450
‐ [exhales]

587
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:15,020
‐ Man, dead you is
just way more zen.

588
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:18,090
So after all that,
why did you stay?

589
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,859
‐ I make a promise,
I keep it.

590
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:23,562
‐ Look, bro, I hear you
and bad timing.

591
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:25,531
But me and the kid?
We didn't die.

592
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:27,833
We just got dragged
into a weird netherworld

593
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:30,502
by the Takers.
‐ Right, you said.

594
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:31,537
Never heard of them.

595
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:34,006
‐ Well, I promise you
they're real and they suck.

596
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:36,108
And we are in the wrong place.

597
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,510
I mean, this can't be
the first time in history

598
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:40,846
not dead people
ended up here, right?

599
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,314
Accidents happen.

600
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:43,849
There's got to be
some protocol

601
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:46,752
or some special
dispensation thing.

602
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:48,687
‐ Anyone sent
to the Underworld by mistake

603
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:50,889
has 24 hours
to file a dispute.

604
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:52,758
‐ Great, let's file a dispute.

605
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:56,662
‐ Disputes have
to be sent up top.

606
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:59,064
And since Hades left,
we can't.

607
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:03,068
‐ So if we don't find Hades,
we're just stuck?

608
00:25:03,102 --> 00:25:04,603
‐ I'm sorry.

609
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:08,974
‐ Does he have, like,
a pager or a walkie?

610
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:11,377
‐ If he doesn't want
to be found, he won't be.

611
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,479
The Underworld is big.

612
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,680
He could be anywhere.

613
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:18,751
‐ Well could I maybe get a map
and start checking things off?

614
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,488
‐ Shit.

615
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:26,658
I might know someone
who can help.

616
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:30,129

620
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:43,075

621

‐ [scoffs]
This is so typical.

622
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:47,946
You don't come to my brunches,
which I guess is fine,

623
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,481
but you could at least RSVP.

624
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:52,651
‐ That is
the polite thing to do

625
00:25:52,684 --> 00:25:54,920
so he doesn't have
too much food.

626
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,124
‐ That makes sense.

627
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:01,860
‐ Anyway, we need an expert.

628
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,095
That is why we're here.

629
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:06,765
And I gather you are the guy
who knows where everything is.

630
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,635

a thing or two.

632
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,037

where he is.

636
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,844

637
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:20,779

he disappeared, right?

638
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:21,647
Very odd.

639

at least one person

640

641
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:27,553
‐ But you know all his spots?

642
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:30,122
‐ Gods no.
Quite the opposite.

643
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:32,791
He is insanely strict on me.

644
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:36,195
You know, I'm not even allowed
to map the place where he...

645
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:37,863
[whispers] Wait a minute.

646
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:43,502
He forbade me from mapping
an area in the Underworld.

647
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:46,705
I always suspected he had some
kind of special retreat there.

648
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,807
‐ I'm sorry, if it's
not on the map,

649
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:50,642
what good
would that do us?

650
00:26:50,676 --> 00:26:52,654
‐ Well, because I mapped
everything else around it.

651
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:57,182
So in an ironic way, it's
like I mapped it... perfectly.

The Underworld is in shambles,
and Hades is out here doing...

703

Whatever this is?

‐ Pink Himalayan sea salt.

So I've heard.

This temple is off limits.

‐ Yes, hi.
We are looking for Hades.

‐ Respectfully,

714
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,810
we wouldn't come here
if it wasn't urgent.

715
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:14,313
Can you please let him know
that we are here?

716
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:16,014
‐ No, he's gone.

717
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:18,250
‐ Well, he can't just be gone.

718
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:21,186
‐ I assume you're here
because he just up and left.

719
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:23,322
And you're worried
it was for good.

720
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:24,990
Well, I'm sorry to tell you,

721
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:27,025
when he left, he told me
he might never be back.

722

‐ Wait, what?
‐ Never?

723

like elaborating.

724
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:31,496
‐ It's just some of us

725
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:32,707

the Underworld running.

726
00:30:32,731 --> 00:30:35,834
‐ Yeah, and some of us
are trying to map it.

727
00:30:35,867 --> 00:30:37,669
‐ And he is a god.

728
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:39,404
He doesn't answer
to any of you.

How?

not that Penny.

That's... that's Penny.
That's my Penny.

that Josh is in the Underworld.

that he's still alive

763
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,719
and needs our help.

764

the feathers in front of you

do something.
