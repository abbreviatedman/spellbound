376
00:15:21,704 --> 00:15:26,216
Let's say the fetus was
psychic, or even a traveler.

happening in this memory, Todd.

It's a defense mechanism.

389
00:15:52,904 --> 00:15:54,620
The fetus detects the mother's distress

390
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,371
and reacts protectively.

391
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:58,879
You freaked the baby out
with your meltdown,

392
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,369
