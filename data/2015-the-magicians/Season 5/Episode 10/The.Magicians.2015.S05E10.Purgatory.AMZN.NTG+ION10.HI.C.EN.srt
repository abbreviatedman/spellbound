376
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,669
Let's say the fetus was
psychic, or even a traveler.

happening in this memory, Todd.

It's a defense mechanism.

389
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,075
The fetus detects the mother's distress

390
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,829
and reacts protectively.

391
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,330
You freaked the baby out
with your meltdown,

392
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,820
