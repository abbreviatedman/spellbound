<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:04,180
You're not right, El,
and we both know why.

3
00:00:04,204 --> 00:00:05,482
You said you don't
remember what happened

4
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:07,066
when you were
possessed, but Julia does.

5
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:08,365
And I don't.

6
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:11,273
<i>I don't know why you're
accusing me of lying.</i>

7
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:14,346
<i>Eliot. Let me out.</i>

8
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:15,711
We're looking for Stoppard.

9
00:00:15,816 --> 00:00:17,444
Mom? Mom? What's wrong?

10
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:19,544
Moms die every
day. Circle of life.

11
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:21,493
We know you're trying
to look out for your mom.

12
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:22,850
Are you saying you'll leave?

13
00:00:22,923 --> 00:00:24,516
Sorry, man. I'm
not going anywhere.

14
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:26,116
The Harmonic Convergence.

15
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:28,025
Mmm. A.K.A. the
end of the world.

16
00:00:28,128 --> 00:00:31,292
The Convergence will only
occur during this perfect alignment.

17
00:00:31,732 --> 00:00:33,928
If we move the
moon out of position...

18
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,868
No Convergence, no
circumstance, no apocalypse.

19
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:39,465
If you have moon brain,
then you will see her aura.

20
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,532
If it is green,
she is listening.

21
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:45,204
Only then may you
ask her to move.

22
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:46,589
You will need a piece of her.

23
00:00:46,613 --> 00:00:47,876
<i>Like a moon rock?</i>

24
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:49,211
In here, boss.

25
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:50,516
Ladies.

26
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:53,519
You're moving the moon? - Yeah.

27
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:59,188
Uh... Guys.

28
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,695
I think we broke the moon.

29
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,008
NASA estimates just hours

30
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:07,364
<i>before the first pieces
reach our atmosphere.</i>

31
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:10,762
<i>In a tweet, the President
stressed the need for calm,</i>

32
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:14,330
<i>saying, "We will fix
the moon decisively.</i>

33
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:17,970
<i>"The American people have
absolutely nothing to fear."</i>

34
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:28,787
I know we are dealing with
the lunapocalypse problem,

35
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:31,415
but I have to insist
that we all take a minute

36
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:34,620
for a little
self-care/pizza, okay?

37
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:35,752
Okay.

38
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:36,888
<i>Cautioning everyone</i>

39
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:39,593

appears to be coming to an end,</i>

40
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,432
<i>everyone's behavior will still be counted
when the time comes for judgement.</i>

41
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:45,802
Feeling the wrong
kind of boned right now.

42
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,308
At least the Harmonic Convergence
isn't happening anymore.

43
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:54,772
I just have this bad feeling.

44
00:01:55,816 --> 00:01:56,816
Hey.

45
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,113
We'll figure out
how to stop this.

46
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,789
I mean, on the off-chance
the President doesn't.

47
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:03,856
Let's review.

48
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:07,554
Emergency code words
if this all goes shit-shaped.

49
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,319
Um...

50
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:10,663
Really?

51
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:11,959
Kidding. Okay.

52
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,501
As follows. Credenza,
no questions asked.

53
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:18,128
Inglenook, tie those fools up,

54
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:19,798
toss them through
the Fillory portal.

55
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:23,469
Chifforobe, flee to Canada.
Armoire, shield up, stat.

56
00:02:23,577 --> 00:02:26,274
Kimono, all hell's broken
loose. All hell's broken loose.

57
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:30,044
<i>Time and hope are quickly
running out, though rumors about...</i>

58
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,177
Everything I'm seeing says the first
chunk's gonna hit around 10:00 p.m.

59
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:35,321
We have 12 hours.

60
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,896
Uh, look, what if we created a
massive portal in the atmosphere?

61
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:46,524
We'd need a specialist, and
the metamath is just... It's too...

62
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,169
This is really bad, Julia.

63
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,797
Uh-uh.

64
00:02:50,871 --> 00:02:52,032
Don't you dare give up.

65
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,185
This math is so
damn frustrating.

66
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,449
Yeah, but you'll get it.

67
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:02,783
Jesus. What
happened to your shoe?

68
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,342
Have you been out there? It's
the literal end of the actual world.

69
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:07,921
No, it's not. We're
gonna stop it.

70
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,388
Tell that to the rioters,
and prayer circles,

71
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,220
and people fucking
in the streets.

72
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:13,927
I can't believe
this is happening.

73
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,019
I'm just numb.

74
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,532
Try the truffled
prosciutto. It's incredible.

75
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:24,800
I did have one idea, after my
very bad idea to take the subway.

76
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,837
Okay, do you know Richard's
Reverse Entropy spell?

77
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:30,319
We already talked about it.
Unfortunately, it's just way too small.

78
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:31,743
True, but I reworked it.

79
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:35,339
And check my math.

80
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,576
Mmm... This is fantastic,

81
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:43,350
but I don't think we have
enough cooperative power.

82
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,558
Chances are high for a surge in
the next 12 hours. We could use it.

83
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:51,655
And we have enough Hedges around the
world on standby to do it with us. So...

84
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,429
It might not be enough.

85
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,129
Well, we make it enough.

86
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,894
Today, we are saving the world.

87
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,872
And this time, it's gonna stick.

88
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,540
Damn right we are.

89
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:03,309
Okay.

90
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:06,905
But just in case...

91
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:09,911
Anything I need to say to you?

92
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:12,685
Jules, we're good.

93
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,669
<i>Scientists around the world have
been sending out their predictions</i>

94
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:22,060

95
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,628

<i>disrupted weather patterns, and
strange behavior from animal life.</i>

98
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,602
<i>And to Sharon Cappanelli
from ninth grade, I lied.</i>

99
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,481
<i>It was my tampon, and
that was your girlfriend.</i>

100
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:43,914
<i>I'm not sorry. But I want...</i>

101
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:45,452
Thanks for spreading
the word, Pete.

102
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,519
Stand by.

103
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:50,489
Everyone's set. We're
just waiting for the surge.

104
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,932
You guys feel that?

105
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:07,006
It's the surge.

106
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:08,537
It's cresting. We should...

107
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,304
Go. Pete, now.

108
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:31,096
Did it work?

109
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:40,832
It didn't work.

110
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,541
We failed.

111
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:06,658
Feeling the wrong
kind of boned right now.

112
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:11,270
At least the Harmonic Convergence
isn't happening anymore.

113
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,183
<i>And though the world's greatest

118
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:31,367

00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,259
We'd need a specialist, and
the metamath is just... It's too...

120
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:37,530
This is really bad.
Am I crazy or...

121
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:38,791
This already happened, right?

122
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:41,377
This math is so
damn frustrating.

123
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,370
This did. This did
already happen.

124
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,170
Ow!

125
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,238
Not a dream.

126
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:51,040
Hey. Am I on something, or
did we try this plan yesterday?

127
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:54,040
Wha... At Westbrook's estate?

128
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:58,117
Jesus.

129
00:06:58,218 --> 00:07:00,244
What happened to your shoe?

130
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,723
Have you been out there?

131
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,917
It's the literal end
of the actual world.

132
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:06,926
No, it's not. We're
stopping it. Oh.

133
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:08,838
Tell that to the rioters,
and prayer circles,

134
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:10,763
and people fucking
in the streets.

135
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,563
We're in a time loop.

136
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:17,397
Excuse us while
we briefly sidebar.

137
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:21,942
Why exactly is this happening?

138
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:23,943
"Why is anything?" he asked,

139
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:27,378
still freaked, because the last thing
he remembers is all of Earth ending.

140
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,207
It felt so inevitable. I know.

141
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,317
But why us, now, time loop?

142
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:36,085
Of course we're the
chosen ones. We're us.

143
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:39,051
Okay, everybody.

144
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,525
What is going on with you two?

145
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,789
Quick recap. Kady's
plan won't work.

146
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:46,094
We tried it, and the moon
still crashed into the Earth.

147
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,860
Okay. What do
you mean, tried it?

148
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:51,067
We suspect we're in a time loop.

149
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,137
How?

150
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:56,635
Obviously, the moon's a wily
cunt who doesn't wanna die.

151
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:58,610
Okay.

152
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,871
All right, so not
Reverse Entropy.

153
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:03,014
What do you guys suggest?

154
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:05,608
We cast Vinnola's
Oxygen Saver on Penny 23.

155
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:08,280
Then he travels to the moon.
It's easier to do a portal there.

156
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:10,824
Oh, GPS is kinda broken.
I might end up in a wall.

157
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,485
It's the apocalypse.
Gonna need you to try.

158
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,796
Fuck all of you. Fine.

159
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,171
You got this, man.

160
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,310
Oh! Oh, no! No, no, no!

161
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,078
Okay, forget the moon.
Let's move the Earth.

162
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:49,705
Kady, get your hedge
witches on the horn.

163
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:51,664
We got cooperating
to do. I'm on it.

164
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:57,380
Okay. I found a
spell that can hold

165
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:59,066
the pieces in
suspension. We just...

166
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:01,839
Right. Good to assume we
can all do sphincter magic?

167
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,941
Can we make this very big?

168
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:15,478
Mother shit.

169
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:17,189
You... You okay?

170
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:20,924
No, Julia, I'm not
okay. Bless you.

171
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:23,162
Whoa.

172
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:25,325
Allow me to explain.

173
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,799
So, here we are, eight loops in.

174
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:28,901
Ten.

175
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:31,329
If these loops sent us
back even a little earlier,

176
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,404
we could stop Marina

177
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:35,065
from bad-touching this
whole situation, but we can't.

178
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,535
So we need time magic.

179
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,272
I know a horomancer who builds
machines. Maybe he has something.

180
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:40,904
Fantastic. <i>Vámonos.</i>

181
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,576
One problem. I kind of let his
mom die last time I saw him.

182
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:45,651
Oh.

183
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:50,189
Oh, come on. Like
you guys are all saints?

184
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,258
You're in a time loop?

185
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,059
But why you two?

186
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:57,894
'Cause we're the best-looking.
Here. This is Penny's address.

187
00:09:58,131 --> 00:09:59,599
Margo, what are you doing? Shh.

188
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:00,997
Favorite coffee shop,

189
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:03,141
hipster club where we
suspect he DJs on the weekend,

190
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,228
and it's your lucky day.

191
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:07,138
His traveling's borked, so
he's a sitting duck in a scarf.

192
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,402
Margo, we can't just kill Penny.

193
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:12,139
We don't, he dies anyway,
along with everyone.

194
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:14,407
This is basic
trolley problem shit.

195
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:15,915
Ovary up. Okay.

196
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,815
If I wanted revenge on Penny, I
would've gotten that a long time ago.

197
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:26,258
You've got
particles all over you.

198
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,260
Were you spritzed
with something?

199
00:10:28,328 --> 00:10:29,489
Spritzed, like, with what?

200
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:32,828
Something that nebulized a cloud
of temporal permanence around you?

201
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,400
Mmm.

202
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,958
Permanence.

203
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:38,864
For men and women.

204
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:42,170
Yeah, I may have accidentally
stolen a weird perfume bottle

205
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:43,743
from a time witch in Fillory.

206
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,743
Okay, whatever you really did,
it's created a field around you both.

207
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,784
That would explain
why you're in a time loop.

208
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,043
Ah. And here we
thought we were special.

209
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:56,989
What are you doing? Helping.

210
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,767
You said it's the end
of the world, right?

211
00:10:58,791 --> 00:10:59,791
That is right.

212
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:03,830
I think I can hop you guys back a
full 48 hours so you can prevent this.

213
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,623
Oh, really? Just like that?

214
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:08,293
Well, really
goddamn complicated,

215
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:09,700
but I'm a genius.

216
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:12,634
Oh. Oh!

217
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,673
Here we go.

218
00:11:18,044 --> 00:11:19,603
Are we time traveling right now?

219
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,447
The hell? What's wrong?

220
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,877
Nothing's working. At all.

221
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:30,218
Are you saying your
shit's broken? I hope so.

222
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:33,691
The alternative is all time
magic's in some kind of lockdown.

223
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,004
What could even do that?

224
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:38,157
Something powerful and ancient.

225
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:40,262
You mean like the moon?

226
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,693
Maybe if I just fix this, and
bypass the oscillations...

227
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,398
Hey, no rush, but in 30
seconds, we're all gonna die.

228
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:50,033
This will get you there.
Not in one piece, but...

229
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:51,202
Wait. What?

230
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,948
Shit. I'm sorry. Oh, well.

231
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:05,489
I cannot believe we didn't
consider going to Jane Chatwin first.

232
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,823
Well, she is a person
that may be upset with us.

233
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:08,894
Fuck this.

234
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:12,858
No. Huh.

235
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:16,591
Time magic's locked down
and portal to Fillory's blocked?

236
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,431
This smacks of a
not-so-random coincidence.

237
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:26,376
Okay, we can still get
there. Penny can't do shit.

238
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:28,142
What about that other
Traveler dick-bucket?

239
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,491
Gavin? What's his name?

240
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,260
Everything I'm seeing says the first
chunk's gonna hit around 10:00 p.m.

241
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:33,947
We know! Twelve hours.

242
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,599
We're seeing this wrong.
We're missing something.

243
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:39,149
Uh, maybe we need
to take a step back,

244
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:41,091
start thinking outside the box.

245
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,994
What do you suggest?
Remember Professor Soto?

246
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:45,622
The one with the pants.

247
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:48,896
Yeah. He had that ridiculous test
everyone thought was impossible.

248
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:51,460
That we solved, because
we rule. Solved how?

249
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:53,972
You want me to remember a
solution I came up with at a rager,

250
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:56,133
doing upside-down
shots in a fur bikini?

251
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,977
You say "rager," I say
"problem-solving session."

252
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,504
That's how we do.

253
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,708
We put our minds on
something different,

254
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,048
we catch the solution out
of the corner of our eye.

255
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,631
Is this actually a plan or do
you just wanna blow off steam?

256
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:09,987
Two birds, Bambi.

257
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:13,355
Besides, we're stuck in a
game that keeps hitting reset.

258
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,729
Infinite time, zero
consequences.

259
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,925
Just you and me, saving the
world through unbridled hedonism.

260
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,625
Mmm, fine. Let's do it.

261
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:27,539
<i>Eliot.</i>

262
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,603
Hey. Uh, hey.

263
00:13:32,378 --> 00:13:33,522
Did someone just
knock on the door?

264
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:34,912
No. We going?

265
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,183
Yeah.

266
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:44,554
Okay, miscreants,
it's Armageddon.

267
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,649
So, die as you lived. Boring.

268
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:51,220
Or join us in an end-of-the-world
soiree, and die legends. Your choice.

269
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:52,799
You heard the man.

270
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:56,635
Come on!

271
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,101
It's a tie!

272
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:01,704
Anything?

273
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,370
Not yet.

274
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:07,779
Come on!

275
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:16,054
<i>Gimme your control</i>

276
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,426
<i>Gimme your control</i>

277
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:24,491
Mmm. MAN: <i>Eliot.</i>

278
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,796
El. El. You look
like you saw a ghost.

279
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,998
Hey, ask it how
we stop the moon.

280
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,605
Actually, I think
I might... Wait.

281
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,801
Oh, my God. I think
I got something.

282
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:40,040
An idea. Hit me.

283
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,713
Cock and balls. I forgot.

284
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:01,631
This isn't working.
No offense, Rajit.

285
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:03,235
It's Todd.

286
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,737
No. Come back when you're Rajit.

287
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,604
You know, I've been thinking.

288
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,630
Clearly, we need
something a little bit stronger.

289
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:14,112
No, we need an idea.

290
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,642
You know what?
I'm gonna go hydrate,

291
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:20,618
and, I dunno, stare at moon
chunks hurling straight for Earth.

292
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,446
Can't be worse than
discovering I just jacked Todd off

293
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:24,956
for three time loops in a row.

294
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:29,752
<i>Eliot.</i>

295
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:33,931
No.

296
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,492
It's never happening.

297
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,099
Leave me alone.

298
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:45,443
<i>I never, never,
never get so close</i>

299
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,480
<i>It's under control</i>

300
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,075
<i>I'm reachin' the
end of a hallway</i>

301
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,244
<i>I never, never, never</i>

302
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:56,050
<i>Been so out of my body...</i>

303
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,063
I can walk away from you

304
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,535
all fucking day!

305
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,971
Pardon me, Brenda. Get this...

306
00:16:26,185 --> 00:16:27,312
I got a lead.

307
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,380
I've been talking to this
weird oceanographer guy,

308
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:31,152
who, no joke, has
a dolphin harem,

309
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:33,158
but he also knows
some real shit about...

310
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:36,086
Hey, what's up with you?

311
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:39,423
What's up is, hmm,

312
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:43,334
my brain is a
snake eating its tail,

313
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:46,133
and the tail is another
snake eating its tail.

314
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,140
Jesus. Okay, you stay here.

315
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,199
I'll report back
with some research.

316
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,650
I figured it out, El.

317
00:17:05,224 --> 00:17:07,455
From talking to
that dolphin-fucker.

318
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:10,158
Everything he said checked out.

319
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:12,698
We need to go to Fisher Beach.

320
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:16,463
It's kinda out of the
way. Lifeguard station 17.

321
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,848
Everything I'm seeing
says the first chunk's...

322
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:20,896
Eliot.

323
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,509
We have 12 hours. - Hey.

324
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,002
I got the answer. You
can take a breather.

325
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:27,376
Not right now, Margo.

326
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,015
Okay, <i>Leaving Las Vegas.</i>

327
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:33,849
I was happy to give you space to tell
your Monster secrets in your own time,

328
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,617
but we're stuck in this
Jean-Paul Sartre bullshit,

329
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,190
and you're getting worse fast.

330
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:40,192
I told you this isn't
important right now, okay?

331
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:43,229
Whatever it is you remember,
it's not your fault, okay?

332
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:45,096
This math is so damn hard.

333
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:47,166
Can we just stop the
moon first, please?

334
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:50,635
Not if your liver falls out of
your twat first. Let's talk about it.

335
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:51,903
No.

336
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:54,338
Seems like we have to. It's me.

337
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:57,500
Don't be a coward. Stop.

338
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:03,511
It's still in me, okay?

339
00:18:08,454 --> 00:18:10,616
I am seeing what I am seeing.

340
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,820
Some pieces of
it must've held on.

341
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:14,818
The Monster's gone.

342
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,624
I exorcised it, and Q
threw it into the Seam.

343
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,596
The only thing here
is, you medicating

344
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:22,635
instead of facing your
memories and your feelings.

345
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:25,364
And I empathize, I do,

346
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,839
but I think you're forgetting
you can tell me anything.

347
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,309
I just told you and
you didn't believe me.

348
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:35,414
I love you, even
when you're nuts.

349
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,243
But our window's 12
hours to stop the moon

350
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,785
or it's game over again,

351
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,651
and I need it to be fixed
before I go as nuts as you.

352
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:44,121
So just sit this round out.

353
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,590
No. And I'll go alone.

354
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:48,093
No, no, no. Please,
please. I can...

355
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:50,822
You can't. I can
keep it together.

356
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,794
See you yesterday. I
can keep it together.

357
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:54,026
Please, no, Margo.

358
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:28,165
I'm feeling the wrong
kind of boned right now.

359
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:31,196
Okay. I'm sorry.

360
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,833
What you said yesterday...

361
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:35,898
Yesterday? At Westbrook's house?

362
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:43,879
Yesterday, before you
went to Fisher Beach.

363
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,010
I didn't go to Fisher Beach.

364
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:49,648
You don't...

365
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:52,819
You don't remember.

366
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:57,022
Remember that tit-chafe Marina showed
up and broke the moon? How could I forget?

367
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,834
Did Josh just
sneeze on the pizza?

368
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:15,074
So, let's release that
ache, that desire for control.

369
00:20:15,581 --> 00:20:17,880
Understand the moment we're in.

370
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,509
Accept our state of being.

371
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:24,547
Take a breath, send a prayer up
to the god of your understanding.

372
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:26,683
Send a prayer and accept.

373
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,558
Amen. ALL: Amen.

374
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:29,861
Thank you.

375
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:34,667
You've momentarily
lessened my existential dread.

376
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:40,478
<i>This may be the end.</i>

377
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:43,543
<i>No, I'm not reading this.</i>

378
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,407
Okay, asshole. Bring it.

379
00:20:48,447 --> 00:20:49,927
<i>I just want to say...</i>

380
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:54,749
<i>This world is flawed.</i>

381
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:59,320
<i>We each have
good in us, and bad.</i>

382
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,518
<i>Every day, we fight
to let the good win.</i>

383
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:05,158
<i>This is the last day.</i>

384
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,260
<i>Think about those who you love.</i>

385
00:21:07,466 --> 00:21:09,799
<i>Turn off the TV
and be with them.</i>

386
00:21:09,902 --> 00:21:11,268
<i>Thank you, and...</i>

387
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,969
I'm sorry. Were
you listening to that?

388
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:18,908
It was so depressing.

389
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:21,475
Not really.

390
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:22,976
Hey. You okay?

391
00:21:23,716 --> 00:21:25,912
Not really. Me neither.

392
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:27,786
Cookie?

393
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:29,954
Yeah.

394
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:36,918
I have to admit, I don't
think their spell will work.

395
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:39,625
It won't.

396
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:41,996
I can't believe
I'm about to die.

397
00:21:43,002 --> 00:21:48,942
You are. But then, you'll
just start all over again.

398
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:52,838
We're in a time loop.

399
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:56,176
Shut up. Seriously?

400
00:21:57,616 --> 00:22:01,109
That's a relief. Like,
uh, <i>Groundhog Day?</i>

401
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:06,183
Or <i>Russian Doll?</i> Or <i>Happy Death
Day?</i> Or <i>Happy Death Day 2U?</i>

402
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:08,523
Or <i>Source Code?</i>
Oh, that <i>X-Files.</i>

403
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:10,493
The <i>Star Trek, Edge of Tomorrow,</i>

404
00:22:10,563 --> 00:22:11,807
but really <i>All You Need is Kill,</i>

405
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:14,665
and it's like, why change
the title like that, right?

406
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,167
Wow.

407
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:18,837
You really love time
loop stories, don't you?

408
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:22,642
And you're awake in the loop.
You're the hero. I am totally jealous.

409
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:28,478
Hey, you wanna get out of here?

410
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,408
I've got this place
on my bucket list,

411
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:34,043
and, well, uh,
it's gotta be now.

412
00:22:34,253 --> 00:22:37,417
<i>And to Sharon Cappanelli
from ninth grade, I lied.</i>

413
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:38,523
Man.

414
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:40,335
<i>It was my tampon, and
that was your girlfriend.</i>

415
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,359
Time loops.

416
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:42,504
<i>I'm not sorry. But I want you...</i>

417
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,554
Gnarly. They're
extremely gnarly.

418
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:47,125
So, you're talking
to me about it.

419
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,327
Yeah.

420
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:53,198
As opposed to
Alice, Julia or Kady,

421
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:56,674
or, to state the obvious, Margo.

422
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:59,805
I kinda blew it beyond
repair with Margo.

423
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:03,049
How is anything beyond repair
when you're stuck in a time loop?

424
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:07,720
Well, she was awake
with me for a while,

425
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:12,724
and then she got kicked out
somehow, and now I am utterly alone.

426
00:23:13,459 --> 00:23:17,453
Well, if I'm learning anything
from these squishy pierogi tacos,

427
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,022
it's that not everything
belongs together.

428
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,427
How can we help?
Help save the world?

429
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:31,571
Honestly, I don't know.
It might not be possible.

430
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,713
This might be it.

431
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:37,742
Me, alone,

432
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:41,285
in this particular
12 hours, eternally.

433
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,746
Okay. That sounds
like a lot for you.

434
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:50,229
So, uh, anything I
can do to help you?

435
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:53,964
I wish, because the
longer this goes on,

436
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:57,798
the more certain I am that The Monster
is inside of me and trying to get out.

437
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,070
Good metaphor.

438
00:24:00,572 --> 00:24:01,767
I'm being literal.

439
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,441
Oh.

440
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:04,842
Shit.

441
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:08,245
It's worse every loop.

442
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:12,774
I hear its voice. I see
blood on the walls.

443
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:15,821
I... I see this door.

444
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:16,921
It wants out.

445
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:19,857
Have you tried letting it out?

446
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:21,860
Why in God's name
would I do that?

447
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:23,653
Uh, I'm just spit-balling.

448
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:26,231
A lot of the time,
in these movies,

449
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:28,228
the solution to the problem

450
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,134
is facing the thing
you're most afraid of.

451
00:24:31,704 --> 00:24:32,704
What if I die?

452
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,869
What if you do?

453
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:45,116
Why?

454
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:47,846
Anyway...

455
00:24:49,254 --> 00:24:51,086
You're not upset
you're about to die?

456
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,453
I don't love it.

457
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,423
But you'll figure
out a way to fix this.

458
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:08,516
<i>Though the world's
greatest minds are locked</i>

459
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,133
<i>in a desperate race
to save humanity...</i>

460
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:11,286
Everything I'm seeing

461
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,279
says the first chunk's
gonna hit around 10:00 p.m.

462
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,677
We have 12 hours.

463
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,596
What if we create a massive
portal in the atmosphere?

464
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,029
We'd need a specialist and...

465
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:22,907
Charlton?

466
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,713
Well, fuck.

467
00:26:31,123 --> 00:26:32,557
How the hell are you here?

468
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:35,989
I was trapped wandering
your remembrances,

469
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:39,793
when, mercifully, you decided not to
sleep for five days and broke your brain.

470
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,625
That gave me an
opening to contact you.

471
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:46,103
That voice? That was you?

472
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:47,933
Yes, of course.

473
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:50,066
When all the scary
creatures were pulled out,

474
00:26:50,142 --> 00:26:52,077
I held on tight as I could
in your Happy Place,

475
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:54,306
and, well, here we are.

476
00:26:56,248 --> 00:26:58,410
This place was so
vivid in your mind,

477
00:26:58,484 --> 00:27:00,953
but there is nothing like
the real thing, is there?

478
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,653
The sights, the sounds.

479
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:07,187
The smells. Oh!

480
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:11,957
I forgot about smells, Eliot. They
are overwhelmingly unpleasant.

481
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:14,499
Those messages?
That was you, too?

482
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,429
"I'm still here." "Let me out."

483
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:20,996
Yes. I wanted you to
know that I was still here,

484
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:22,574
and I wanted to be let out.

485
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:24,174
In red paint?

486
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,446
Right, like strawberries
and Santa Claus.

487
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,114
And blood, Charlton.

488
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:30,740
Perhaps it was a touch ominous.

489
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:33,308
As was the creepy whisper.
I was trying to be polite.

490
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:34,418
Well...

491
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:40,184
It is nice to have a
non-imaginary imaginary friend

492
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:41,612
for the end of
the world, I guess.

493
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,660
Half-imaginary.

494
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:45,825
I was a passenger
in your unconscious.

495
00:27:45,898 --> 00:27:48,663
Now, I'm still in your head.

496
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:51,664
But the conscious part.

497
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:55,339
I can't tell you how much
of an improvement this is.

498
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,036
Your Happy Place is nice,

499
00:27:57,142 --> 00:28:00,670
and I was able to see everything
you were doing here, but...

500
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:04,683
Well, there's no
substitute for being heard.

501
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:07,123
Especially since I often
disagree with your choices,

502
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:08,484
and I'd like to
share my opinions.

503
00:28:08,554 --> 00:28:09,783
That's peachy.

504
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:11,881
Well, let's start now.

505
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,859
Opinion on what to do next?

506
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:18,688
Oh, well, I think
that's obvious.

507
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:22,034
Is it? In case
you didn't notice,

508
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,729
Margo was sort of driving
the bus on this whole thing,

509
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:26,168
before I screwed
up and lost her.

510
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:27,934
But you didn't lose her, Eliot.

511
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,372
She's out of the
loops, Charlton.

512
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,740
No, I simply mean, I
don't think that's about you.

513
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:36,905
I think she got too
close to the answer.

514
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:41,284
Perhaps that's why she was thrown
from your shared loop experience.

515
00:28:43,055 --> 00:28:45,047
That does have
the ring of logic to it.

516
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:47,851
Margo mentioned a
beach, did she not?

517
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:49,922
Fisher Beach.

518
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,754
Okay.

519
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:55,826
Let's go.

520
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,261
Why is there no one here?

521
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:02,739
I think it's a "cancel your
beach trip" kinda day today.

522
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:06,739
Just keep your eyes peeled for anyone
or anything that might not want us here.

523
00:29:11,883 --> 00:29:14,216
Is that phone wire?

524
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:21,256
Are phones generally
used underwater?

525
00:29:27,165 --> 00:29:28,463
I think we got a lead.

526
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:32,098
Lifeguard Station 17. It's
the same track Margo was on.

527
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,433
This didn't go well for her,

528
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,316
so perhaps we should discuss
before going in there, okay?

529
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,865
Ovary up, Charlton.

530
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:48,819
Um...

531
00:29:50,422 --> 00:29:54,484
I guess... "Off" and "Whales."

532
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:58,439
<i>What is the purpose
of this distraction?</i>

533
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,625
With whom are we speaking?

534
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:02,667
<i>We are the whales.</i>

535
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:06,765
Like, all of them?

536
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:08,270
<i>Of course.</i>

537
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,009
Why do you speak through a TV?

538
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:13,908
<i>Why do you? What is
the nature of your query?</i>

539
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:16,613
Okay, I don't really
know how to explain this.

540
00:30:16,682 --> 00:30:18,082
Um...

541
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:22,212
Okay, so you probably don't
know this, but we are in a time loop.

542
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:24,552
<i>We are aware of the disturbance.</i>

543
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,022
Oh. Huh.

544
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,092
Whales grok time loops.

545
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:33,963
So, do you happen to remember if a
woman named Margo came to see you?

546
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:37,161
Uh, brilliant, about yea
high, maybe a little brusque.

547
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:38,999
<i>A contemptuous creature.</i>

548
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,767
<i>We were compelled to wash
away her temporal immunity.</i>

549
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,539
You took her Permanence off?

550
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:46,644
Why?

551
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:48,237
<i>Her manner was appalling.</i>

552
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:53,114
That does sound like Margo.

553
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:56,246
Okay. I apologize for
her bedside manner.

554
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:59,416
And I just... I humbly
and I respectfully ask,

555
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,359
do you...

556
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:04,590
do you have any insight
into this loop that we're in?

557
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,426
<i>Our magic caused it.</i>

558
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:09,731
You're Magicians?

559
00:31:09,835 --> 00:31:13,670
<i>Pay attention. We
will explain. Once.</i>

560
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,266
<i>Our ancestors made a
pact with the Old Gods.</i>

561
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:21,245
<i>And so we spend our lives
tracing sigils into the ocean floor.</i>

562
00:31:21,346 --> 00:31:23,144
<i>This task is crucial.</i>

563
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:26,844
Why?

564
00:31:27,052 --> 00:31:29,886
<i>To ensure the
Kraken stays dormant.</i>

565
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,292
Like "the Kraken" Kraken?

566
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:36,021
What's a Kraken Kraken?

567
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:40,293
<i>Should the Kraken ever awaken,
it would soon consume the world.</i>

568
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,731
Okay. Got it.

569
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:45,934
So, the loops... Why?

570
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:49,405
<i>The moon collided with Earth,
obliterated our protective sigils,</i>

571
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,705
<i>causing the Kraken to rise.</i>

572
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:54,880
Kinda seems like a hat on a hat

573
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:56,608
when you've already
got a moon apocalypse.

574
00:31:56,715 --> 00:32:00,117
<i>A bit flippant for a creature
who caused said apocalypse.</i>

575
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:04,087
<i>Fortunately, our ancestors
implemented a failsafe.</i>

576
00:32:04,189 --> 00:32:06,920
<i>If the Kraken awakens, it
sends Earth back 12 hours,</i>

577
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:09,927
<i>to allow another chance
to avert catastrophe.</i>

578
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:13,195
Whereupon it will all
just keep happening,

579
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:15,234
because the fucking
moon is broken.

580
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,098
<i>So it would seem.</i>

581
00:32:17,202 --> 00:32:22,266
Well, uh, if you're Magicians, then
maybe you can help fix the moon?

582
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:25,435
<i>We cannot. We must
maintain our sigils.</i>

583
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:27,268
Okay.

584
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:32,374
If you don't fix the moon, the
Kraken's just gonna keep krakening.

585
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,147
<i>This distraction has
gone on too long.</i>

586
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:35,252
Wait. No, no, no.

587
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,931
<i>We must attend to the
sigils.</i> ELIOT: Hold on.

588
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,151
<i>Do not contact us
again.</i> No, no, no.

589
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:40,623
No.

590
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:41,959
Uh...

591
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:44,962
Shit.

592
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:50,794
Feeling the wrong
kind of boned right now.

593
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,963
Oh, okay. Bye, I guess.

594
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:01,477
What am I supposed to do?

595
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:03,707
I can't fix the moon.
That won't work.

596
00:33:03,949 --> 00:33:06,646
You can't help.
You're a non-corporeal.

597
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:07,718
True.

598
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:12,122
But...

599
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:15,423
You are not alone.

600
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,694
So, whales really are
powerful Magicians.

601
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,269
I knew they did weird
stuff on the ocean floor.

602
00:33:24,336 --> 00:33:25,736
I didn't realize it was... Wait.

603
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,432
Yes. Alice. Tell me what
else you know about whales.

604
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:29,507
Um...

605
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:32,040
Their closest
cousin is the hippo.

606
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:34,374
Mmm... Mating
season is in the fall.

607
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:35,970
That is so sad for them.

608
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:37,687
What if they never
get to make love again?

609
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,281
Though I am one to talk.
It's been over 1,000 years.

610
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,843
It's not exactly what I needed.

611
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,718
Well, you asked me what I knew.

612
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:47,122
Is there any info about the Kraken
that might point us in a direction?

613
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:53,291
Oh-ho-ho-whoa. Okay, well, you
have your Lovecraftian god krakens,

614
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:57,234
uh, and then there's the <i>D&D</i>
kraken, which is sort of six-of-one,

615
00:33:57,335 --> 00:34:00,703
and then, of course,
there's <i>Clash of the Titans,</i>

616
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:03,003
both the original and
the remake. Thank you.

617
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:04,872
With the very famous line...

618
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:06,138
Thank you, Josh.

619
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:10,515
Every time the Kraken awakens,
time jumps back 12 hours.

620
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:13,347
Which would be great if it took
us back to before the moon broke.

621
00:34:14,586 --> 00:34:18,887
If we get the time loop spell
to trigger a couple hours early...

622
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:21,484
Why don't we just kill
all the damn whales?

623
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:25,152
That's clearly what you tried to do
when they took away your Permanence.

624
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:26,896
But she's right.

625
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:30,434
Maybe we need to let out
the thing that scares us.

626
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:32,026
Maybe we need to, uh...

627
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:35,073
"Release the Kraken!" Exactly.

628
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:37,608
Yeah. Uh, but earlier.

629
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:42,044
Early enough, uh, to
a time before the heist.

630
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:43,604
Shit. We're almost out of time.

631
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:51,732
Look, if the whales have the power
to take away your Permanence,

632
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,190
this could be your last shot.

633
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:56,887
No presh, but
you're our only hope.

634
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,524
I will do my very best.

635
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,603
<i>Surely you jest.</i>

636
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:16,773
I know, I know.

637
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:20,649
It goes against everything you've
ever believed in and I fully respect that.

638
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:22,544
But the only way to fix this

639
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,852
is to release the
Kraken right now.

640
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:29,557
I don't think they
liked that. What? No.

641
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:31,555
God damn it.

642
00:35:32,664 --> 00:35:34,656
Eliot? Eliot?

643
00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:37,326
Please be careful. Uh, you
don't know what they will do.

644
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:38,793
Hey!

645
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:41,601
You know I'm right.

646
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:44,403
I know you're listening.

647
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:48,311
You know, I have
it on good authority

648
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:50,973
that mating
season is in the fall.

649
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:53,041
Do you never want to fuck again?

650
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:55,279
Eliot, that was
too personal. Uh...

651
00:35:56,121 --> 00:35:57,987
Okay, uh, sorry.

652
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:00,349
Look, I get it.

653
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,123
Look, I get it. Your
ancestors made a deal.

654
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:05,493
But special circumstances, okay?

655
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:09,289
Just let it out for 30
seconds. I will fix this.

656
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:10,596
And then, you know,

657
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:14,071
uh, the Kraken will be
back in its safe little seabed,

658
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:18,034
and, uh, you can maintain
your sigils for all of eternity.

659
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:19,538
You gotta trust me.

660
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:22,644
Just release the goddamn Kraken.

661
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,377
Please, please, please.

662
00:36:28,086 --> 00:36:29,918
Look.

663
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,211
Hi there.

664
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,080
Uh...

665
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:58,678
Are you the Kraken?

666
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:00,417
The who?

667
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:09,193
Josh, Margo, Penny,

668
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,024
you guys go inside,
loop all the cameras,

669
00:37:11,096 --> 00:37:12,530
open the side door for Natasha.

670
00:37:12,597 --> 00:37:14,930
I'll be outside waiting
with Eliot and Alice.

671
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:18,435
Holy shit. Holy shit.

672
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:20,596
Holy shit.

673
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:22,901
This is before the moon broke.

674
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:24,975
It worked.

675
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:26,672
Okay, break. ELIOT: Sorry.

676
00:37:31,216 --> 00:37:32,946
Um, could you
just... Could you...

677
00:37:33,051 --> 00:37:34,849
You're freaking
out, aren't you? No.

678
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,582
Look, you can pull the ripcord
now. Get out. We'll handle this.

679
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:40,454
Margo. Credenza.

680
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:44,925
Don't ask questions,
just do what you say?

681
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,289
Mmm-hmm.

682
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:48,298
Fine.

683
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:51,593
Okay, slight change of plans.

684
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,584
We are so close
to saving everyone.

685
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,440
You can't take that
away from us now.

686
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,910
Look, whatever
it is you're after,

687
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:01,742
what's the point if
there's no world left?

688
00:38:01,813 --> 00:38:05,045
There'll still be a world.
Just not as many people.

689
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:06,746
Have you met people?

690
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,986
I've met people. Many people.

691
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:14,718
How many people have you met?
Because I bet I've met more people.

692
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,960
What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Hi.

693
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:19,830
What the hell...

694
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,934
Hell yes.

695
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,198
What? What the... How did you...

696
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,536
Julia, now.

697
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,666
Hey, hot pizza.

698
00:38:57,769 --> 00:38:59,965
That's one pizza
without gluten in it. Whoo.

699
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,971
All right. Oh, nice pour.

700
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:05,566
To us.

701
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:06,917
Yes. Cheers. Cheers. Yes.

702
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:08,106
Bam! Yes, no prob.

703
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,647
All right, Emeril.

704
00:39:10,415 --> 00:39:11,576
Yes. Cheers.

705
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:13,947
Cheers. JULIA: Whoo.

706
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,018
Ooh. Get me.

707
00:39:21,993 --> 00:39:23,222
You don't want a drink?

708
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:28,996
Actually, I desperately do not.

709
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:31,001
That's concerning.

710
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:33,163
Those time loops must've
really done a number on you.

711
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:36,035
So...

712
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,571
You're right. I have
been pushing you away.

713
00:39:40,912 --> 00:39:42,346
Yeah, no shit.

714
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:44,808
It's just...

715
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,850
I do remember The Monster.

716
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:57,224
It was bad and bloody.

717
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:02,824
And, um, those memories
are right here, and, um...

718
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,981
Maybe I really
do need that drink.

719
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:09,736
I don't get why you feel
like you have to go it alone.

720
00:40:13,845 --> 00:40:14,845
I don't either.

721
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:19,949
My logical brain knows without
a doubt that I am better with you.

722
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:21,383
Yes. And same.

723
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,859
Tell your coping
mechanisms to back off,

724
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,920
or I'll punch them in the dick.

725
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:35,429
During the loops,

726
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,197
we were in it together.
And then you were gone.

727
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:41,068
And shocking revelation,

728
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:42,939
I am utterly miserable
when you're not around.

729
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:45,443
Yeah. I know.

730
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:47,103
I don't know if
that's fair to you.

731
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:48,744
What are you talking about?

732
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:53,378
The other thing I learned being
in the loops with you for so long...

733
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:57,653
You're not exactly
who you used to be.

734
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:58,779
You...

735
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:00,154
Please don't say "aged."

736
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:03,656
You've evolved, Margo Hanson.

737
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,658
You've become
more of your true self.

738
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:07,884
You've earned it.

739
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:13,599
I don't want to ask
you to take a step back,

740
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:15,970
just so I can try and catch up.

741
00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:17,074
El.

742
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:20,867
I was a mess you had to untangle
in there, just so you could soldier on.

743
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,281
And once you did, you
figured out how to fix all of this.

744
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,976
Then you picked up the
baton and actually did the thing.

745
00:41:29,354 --> 00:41:31,323
I got lucky. No.

746
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:38,494
It's 'cause you understand
me better than anyone.

747
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:40,824
Mmm-hmm.

748
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,529
So quit acting like

749
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:45,694
you're a screw-up
and get on my level, El.

750
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:50,502
You did it.

751
00:41:51,576 --> 00:41:53,272
You did it when the
world was on the line.

752
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,835
Now do it for yourself.

753
00:42:04,589 --> 00:42:08,026
I don't know if I wanna get on your
level, knowing that you jacked off Todd.

754
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:09,126
I did not.

755
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,193
Yeah, you did.

756
00:42:12,063 --> 00:42:13,190
I did not.

757
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:21,735
What the hell? Coming.

758
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:25,207
Oh, thank God.

759
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:28,412
I've tried every other magical
penthouse in the city, and...

760
00:42:28,513 --> 00:42:32,507
Todd, what... Why are you here?

761
00:42:32,583 --> 00:42:33,583
I need your help.

762
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:36,313
Something just happened that
feels way above my pay grade,

763
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,932
and you were the first person I
thought of who could help me handle it.

764
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:41,391
Okay, it's a weird one.
Just hear me out, okay?

765
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:44,321
So, this pig dude,

766
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,194
who kinda looked like that
one guy Paul Giamatti played

767
00:42:47,265 --> 00:42:50,531
in that one show with all the wigs,
told me I'm supposed to do a quest.

768
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:54,068
Seriously? That
asshole went to you?

769
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:55,971
Wow.

770
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:58,600
Ah, he's extremely
committed to finding a dude.

771
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:01,702
Yeah, it's fine,
Todd. We fixed it.

772
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:02,974
Are you sure?

773
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:04,743
Yeah. Yes. I'm sure.

774
00:43:05,116 --> 00:43:07,108
The Harmonic Convergence
isn't happening anymore.

775
00:43:07,218 --> 00:43:08,618
The who now?

776
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:10,244
The end of the world.

777
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:15,224
Uh, no. He did say the end
of something, but not that.

778
00:43:15,293 --> 00:43:19,060
He was talking about Fillory.
Remind me. Is Fillory real?

779
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,756
The end of Fillory?

780
00:43:24,402 --> 00:43:25,529
So...

781
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,595
So, we saved the wrong world?

782
00:43:32,143 --> 00:43:33,441
So we're not done.

783
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:38,107
Of course.
