I didn't realize it was... Wait.

693
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,432
Yes. Alice. Tell me what
else you know about whales.

694
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:29,507
Um...

695
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:32,040
Their closest
cousin is the hippo.

696
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:34,374
Mmm... Mating
season is in the fall.

697
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:35,970
That is so sad for them.

698
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:37,687
What if they never
get to make love again?

699
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,281
Though I am one to talk.
It's been over 1,000 years.

700
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,843
It's not exactly what I needed.

701
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,718
Well, you asked me what I knew.

702
00:33:43,822 --> 00:33:47,122
Is there any info about the Kraken
that might point us in a direction?

703
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:53,291
Oh-ho-ho-whoa. Okay, well, you
have your Lovecraftian god krakens,

704
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:57,234
uh, and then there's the <i>D&D</i>
kraken, which is sort of six-of-one,

705
00:33:57,335 --> 00:34:00,703
and then, of course,
there's <i>Clash of the Titans,</i>

706
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:03,003
both the original and
the remake. Thank you.

707
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:04,872

708
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:06,138
Thank you, Josh.

709
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:10,515
Every time the Kraken awakens,
time jumps back 12 hours.

710
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:13,347
Which would be great if it took
us back to before the moon broke.

711
00:34:14,586 --> 00:34:18,887
If we get the time loop spell
to trigger a couple hours early...

712
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:21,484
Why don't we just kill
all the damn whales?

713
00:34:21,693 --> 00:34:25,152
That's clearly what you tried to do
when they took away your Permanence.

714
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:26,896
But she's right.

715
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:30,434
Maybe we need to let out
the thing that scares us.

716
00:34:30,535 --> 00:34:32,026
Maybe we need to, uh...

717
00:34:33,104 --> 00:34:35,073
"Release the Kraken!" Exactly.

718
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:37,608
Yeah. Uh, but earlier.

719
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:42,044
Early enough, uh, to
a time before the heist.

720
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:43,604
Shit. We're almost out of time.

to take away your Permanence,

723
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,190
this could be your last shot.

724

is to release the

liked that. What? No.

uh, the Kraken will be
back in its safe little seabed,

feels way above my pay grade,

867
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,932
and you were the first person I
thought of who could help me handle it.

868
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:41,391
Okay, it's a weird one.
Just hear me out, okay?

869
00:42:41,692 --> 00:42:44,321
So, this pig dude,

870
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,194
who kinda looked like that
one guy Paul Giamatti played

871
00:42:47,265 --> 00:42:50,531
in that one show with all the wigs,
told me I'm supposed to do a quest.

872
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:54,068
Seriously? That
asshole went to you?

873
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:55,971
Wow. (SCOFFS)

874
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:58,600
Ah, he's extremely
committed to finding a dude.

875
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:01,702
Yeah, it's fine,
Todd. We fixed it.

876
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:02,974
Are you sure?

877
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:04,743
Yeah. Yes. I'm sure.

878
00:43:05,116 --> 00:43:07,108
The Harmonic Convergence
isn't happening anymore.

879
00:43:07,218 --> 00:43:08,618
The who now?

880
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:10,244
The end of the world.

881
00:43:10,354 --> 00:43:15,224
Uh, no. He did say the end
of something, but not that.

882
00:43:15,293 --> 00:43:19,060
He was talking about Fillory.
Remind me. Is Fillory real?

883
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,756
The end of Fillory?

884
00:43:24,402 --> 00:43:25,529
So...

885
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,595
So, we saved the wrong world?

886
00:43:32,143 --> 00:43:33,441
So we're not done.

887
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:38,107
Of course.
