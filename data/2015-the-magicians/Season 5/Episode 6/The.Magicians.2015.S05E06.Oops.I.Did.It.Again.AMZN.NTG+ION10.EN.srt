1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,350
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,200
You're not right, El,
and we both know why.

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,508
You said you don't remember
what happened

4
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,129
when you were possessed, but Julia does.

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,469
And I don't.

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,339
I don't know why you're
accusing me of lying.

7
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,429
Eliot, let me out.

8
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,809
We're looking for Stoppard.

9
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:22,500
Mom? Mom, what's wrong?

10
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,630
Moms die every day. Circle of life.

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,519
We know you're trying to
look out for your mom.

12
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,979
You're saying you'll leave?

13
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,609
Sorry, man. I'm not going anywhere.

14
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,670
The Harmonic Convergence.

15
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,109
AKA the end of the world.

16
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:36,409
The convergence will only occur
during this perfect alignment.

17
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,090
If we move the moon out of position...

18
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,119
No Convergence,
no Circumstance, no apocalypse.

19
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,539
If you have moon brain,
then you will see Her aura.

20
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:46,620
If it is green, She is listening.

21
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:50,290
Only then may you ask Her to move.

22
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,590
You will need a piece of Her.

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,959
Like a moon rock?

24
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,339
In here, boss.

25
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,509
Ladies.

26
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:58,639
- You're moving the moon?
- Yeah.

27
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,769
Uh, guys?

28
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,760
I think we broke the moon.

29
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,910
NASA estimates just hours

30
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,550
before the first pieces
reach our atmosphere.

31
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,910
In a tweet, the president
stressed the need for calm,

32
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,320
saying, "We will fix
the moon decisively.

33
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:23,530
The American people have
absolutely nothing to fear."

34
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:33,830
I know we are dealing with
the lunapocalypse problem,

35
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,509
but I have to insist that
we all take a minute

36
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,719
for a little self-care/pizza, okay?

37
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,840
Okay.

38
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,770
Cautioning everyone
that though the world

39
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,540
appears to be coming to an end,

40
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,750
everyone's behavior
will still be counted

41
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,550
when the time comes for judgment.

42
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,870
Feeling the wrong kind
of boned right now.

43
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,740
At least the Harmonic Convergence

44
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,300
isn't happening anymore.

45
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,800
I just have this bad feeling.

46
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,350
Hey.

47
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,310
We'll figure out how to stop this.

48
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,950
I mean, on the off-chance
the president doesn't.

49
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,000
Let's review.

50
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,669
Emergency code words if
this all goes shit-shaped?

51
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,660
Um...

52
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:17,010
- Really?
- Kidding. Okay.

53
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,330
As follows.

54
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,660
"Credenza," no questions asked.

55
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,310
"Inglenook," tie those fools up,

56
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,930
toss 'em through the Fillory portal.

57
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,740
"Chifforobe," flee to Canada.

58
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,670
"Armoire," shield up, stat.

59
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,690
"Kimono"...

60
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,349
All hell has broken loose.

61
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,359
Time and hope are quickly running out.

62
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,109
Everything I'm seeing says
the first chunk's gonna hit

63
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,280
around 10:00 p.m.

64
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,780
We have 12 hours.

65
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,790
Uh, look.

66
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,990
What if we created a massive
portal in the atmosphere?

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,560
No, we need a specialist,

68
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:52,500
and the meta-math is just... it's too...

69
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,289
this is really bad, Julia.

70
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,089
Nuh-uh.

71
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,549
Don't you dare give up.

72
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,190
This math is so damn frustrating.

73
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,290
Yeah, but you'll get it.

74
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:05,600
Jesus.

75
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,889
- What happened to your shoe?
- Have you been out there?

76
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,439
It is the literal end
of the actual world.

77
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,020
No, it's not. We're gonna stop it.

78
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,510
Yeah, tell that to the rioters
and the prayer circles

79
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,319
and people fucking in the streets.

80
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,029
I can't believe this is happening.

81
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,100
I'm just numb.

82
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:24,490
Try the truffled prosciutto,
it's incredible.

83
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,619
I did have one idea

84
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,869
after my very bad idea
to take the subway.

85
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:32,910
Okay, do you know Richard's
Reverse Entropy spell?

86
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,988
We already talked about it.

87
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,308
Unfortunately, it's just way too small.

88
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,700
True, but I reworked it.

89
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:40,380
And check my math.

90
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,000
This is fantastic, but...

91
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,599
I don't think we have enough
cooperative power.

92
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,890
Chances are high for a surge
in the next 12 hours.

93
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,479
- We could use it.
- And we have enough hedges

94
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,649
around the world on standby
to do it with us, so...

95
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,560
That might not be enough.

96
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,239
We make it enough.

97
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,989
Today we are saving the world,

98
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,989
and this time it's gonna stick.

99
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,619
Damn right, we are.

100
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,409
Okay.

101
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,040
But just in case...

102
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,040
Anything I need to say to you?

103
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,749
Jules, we're good.

104
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,570
Scientists around the world

105
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,998
have been sending out their predictions

106
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,139
for what we should expect
in the coming hours.

107
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,719
Though the tides remain
mysteriously intact,

108
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,090
expect volcanic activity,

109
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,139
tectonic shifts,
disrupted weather patterns,

110
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,559
and strange behavior from animal life.

111
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,910
And to Sharon Cappanelli
from ninth grade:

112
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,010
I lied.

113
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,510
It was my tampon, and
that was your girlfriend.

114
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,529
I'm not sorry.

115
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:50,630
Thanks for spreading the word, Pete.

116
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,659
Stand by.

117
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,360
Everyone's set.

118
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,070
We're just waiting for the surge.

119
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,140
You guys feel that?

120
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,099
It's the surge.

121
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,639
It's cresting. We should...

122
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,380
Go. Pete, now!

123
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:36,200
Did it work?

124
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,950
It didn't work.

125
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,420
We failed.

126
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,600

127
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,610
Feeling the wrong kind of boned...

128
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,180
right now.

129
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,750
At least the Harmonic Convergence

130
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,430
isn't happening anymore.

131
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,838
Although the world's greatest minds

132
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,230
are locked in a desperate
race to save humanity

133
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,190
from this sudden lunar cataclysm,

134
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,930
time and hope are quickly running out.

135
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,790
Everything I'm seeing
says the first chunk's

136
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,170
gonna hit around 10:00 p.m.

137
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,839
We have 12 hours.

138
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,300
Uh, look, what if we created a
massive portal in the atmosphere?

139
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:39,309
We need a specialist, and the
meta-math is just... it's too...

140
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:42,600
- this is really bad, Julia.
- Am I crazy, or...

141
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,810
This already happened, right?

142
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,250
This math is so damn frustrating.

143
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,279
This did.

144
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,490
This did already happen.

145
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,239
Ow!

146
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,720
Not a dream.

147
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:54,110
Hey, am I on something,

148
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,119
or did we try this plan yesterday?

149
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,270
We're...

150
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,200
At Westbrook's estate?

151
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,129
Jesus.

152
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,629
What happened to your shoe?

153
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,720
Have you been out there?

154
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,950
It's the literal end
of the actual world.

155
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,890
No, it's not. We're stopping it.

156
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,750
Tell that to the rioters,
prayer circles,

157
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,060
and people fucking in the streets.

158
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,680
We're in a time loop.

159
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,520
Excuse us while we briefly sidebar.

160
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,030
Why exactly is this happening?

161
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,029
"Why is anything?" he asked,

162
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:30,818
still freaked, 'cause the
last thing he remembers

163
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,430
is all of Earth ending.

164
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,180
- It felt so inevitable.
- I know.

165
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,440
But why us, now? Time loop?

166
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:40,180
Of course we're the chosen ones.

167
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,210
We're us.

168
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,120
Okay, everybody.

169
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,629
What is going on with you two?

170
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,890
Quick recap, Kady's plan won't work.

171
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,130
We tried it, and the moon
still crashed into the Earth.

172
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,009
Uh, okay. What do you mean, "tried it"?

173
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,139
We suspect we're in a time loop.

174
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,429
How?

175
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,200
Obviously...

176
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,760
the moon's a wily cunt
who doesn't wanna die.

177
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:03,630
Okay.

178
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,970
All right, so no reverse entropy.

179
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,110
What do you guys suggest?

180
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,720
We cast Vinnola's Oxygen
Saver on Penny 23,

181
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,060
then he travels to the moon.

182
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,378
It's easier to do a portal there.

183
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,650
Look, GPS is kinda broken.

184
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,200
- I might end up in a wall.
- It's the apocalypse.

185
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,020
Gonna need you to try.

186
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,919
Fuck all of you. Fine.

187
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,799
You got this, man.

188
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,570
Oh... oh, no! No! No!

189
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,150
Okay, forget the moon.
Let's move the Earth.

190
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,990
Kady, get your hedge
bitches on the horn.

191
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,820
- We got cooperating to do.
- I'm on it.

192
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,409
Okay. I found a spell that can hold

193
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,200
the pieces in suspension, we just...

194
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,959
right, good to assume we can
all do sphincter magic?

195
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,049
Could we make this very big?

196
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,800
Mother-shit!

197
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,310
You... you okay?

198
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:25,030
No, Julia. I'm not okay.

199
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,059
Bless you.

200
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:28,190
Whoa.

201
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,390
Allow me to explain.

202
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,930
So here we are, eight loops in.

203
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,200
Ten.

204
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,430
If these loops sent us back
even a little earlier,

205
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,150
we could stop Marina from bad-touching

206
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,160
this whole situation, but we can't.

207
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,619
Okay, so we need time magic.

208
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:43,590
I know a horomancer who builds machines.

209
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,970
- Maybe he has something.
- Fantastic, vámanos.

210
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,669
One problem... I kind of let his
mom die last time I saw him.

211
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:51,010
Oh.

212
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,710
Oh, come on.

213
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,450
Like you guys are all saints?

214
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,370
You're in a time loop?

215
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,368
- Well, why you two?
- 'Cause we're the best-looking.

216
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,330
Here. This is Penny's address.

217
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,638
Margo, what are you doing?

218
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,970
Favorite coffee shop,

219
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,139
hipster club where we suspect
he DJ's on the weekend,

220
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,530
and it's your lucky day...
his Travelling's borked,

221
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,229
so he's a sitting duck in a scarf.

222
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,470
Margo, we can't just kill Penny.

223
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,310
We don't; he dies anyway,
along with everyone.

224
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,340
This is basic trolley problem shit.

225
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,400
Ovary up.

226
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:23,130
- Okay.
- If I wanted revenge on Penny,

227
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,910
I would've gotten that a long time ago.

228
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:31,370
You've got particles all over you.

229
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,370
Were you spritzed with something?

230
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,589
Spritzed, like with what?

231
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:36,160
Something that nebulized

232
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,919
a cloud of temporal
permanence around you?

233
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,490
Mm.

234
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,090
"Permanence."

235
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,030
For men and women.

236
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,099
Yeah, I may have accidentally stolen

237
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:49,470
a weird perfume bottle from
a time witch in Fillory.

238
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,340
Okay, whatever you really did,

239
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,830
it's created a field around you both

240
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,830
that would explain why you're...

241
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,859
in a time loop.

242
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,150
Ah. And here we thought we were special.

243
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,350
- What are you doing?
- Helping.

244
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,739
You said it's the end
of the world, right?

245
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,710
- That is right.
- I think I can hop you guys back

246
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,909
a full 48 hours so you can prevent this.

247
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,709
Oh, really? Just like that?

248
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:13,410
Well, it's really goddamn complicated,

249
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,250
but I'm a genius.

250
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,709
- Oh.
- Oh.

251
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,040
Here we go.

252
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,680
Are we time traveling right now?

253
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,139
The hell?

254
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,250
What's wrong?

255
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:32,970
Nothing's working... at all.

256
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:35,270
- Are you saying your shit's broken?
- I hope so.

257
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,620
The alternative is...

258
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,779
all time magic's in
some kind of lockdown.

259
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,939
What could even do that?

260
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,200
Something powerful...

261
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,239
and ancient.

262
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,369
You mean like the moon?

263
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,789
Maybe if I just fix this and
bypass the oscillation...

264
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,329
Hey, no rush, but in 30 seconds,

265
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:52,230
we're all gonna die.

266
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,419
This'll get you there.

267
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,130
Not in one piece, but...

268
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,330
Wait, what?

269
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,299
Shit.

270
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,049
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, well.

271
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,060
I cannot believe we didn't consider

272
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,260
going to Jane Chatwin first.

273
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,460
Well, she is a person that
may be upset with us.

274
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:12,065
Yes.

275
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,719
- No.
- Huh.

276
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,309
Time magic's locked down,

277
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:20,099
and the portal to Fillory's blocked.

278
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,030
This smacks of a
not-so-random coincidence.

279
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,510
Okay.

280
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,230
We can still get there.
Penny can't do shit.

281
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,010
What about that other
Traveller dickbucket,

282
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,748
- Gavin what's-his-name?
- Everything I'm seeing

283
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,078
says the first chunk's gonna
hit around 10:00 p.m....

284
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,839
We know! 12 hours.

285
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,419
We're seeing this wrong.
We're missing something.

286
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,000
Uh, maybe we need to take a step back.

287
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,030
Start thinking outside the box.

288
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,730
- What do you suggest?
- Remember Professor Soto?

289
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,190
- Oh, the one with the pants?
- Yeah.

290
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,650
He had that ridiculous test

291
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,769
everyone thought was impossible.

292
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,139
That we solved because we rule.

293
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,099
- Solved how?
- You want me to remember

294
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,910
a solution I came up with at a rager

295
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,020
doing upside-down shots in a fur bikini?

296
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,810
You say rager,

297
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,280
I say problem-solving session.

298
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,400
That's how we do:

299
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:06,550
we put our minds on something different

300
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,030
and we catch the solution out
of the corner of our eye.

301
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,058
So is this actually a plan

302
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,449
or do you just wanna blow off steam?

303
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:12,890
Two birds, Bambi.

304
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,249
Besides, we're stuck in a game
that keeps hitting reset.

305
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,590
Infinite time, zero consequences.

306
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,460
Just you and me saving the world

307
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:22,800
through unbridled hedonism.

308
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:26,219
Mm, fun. Let's do it.

309
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,810
Eliot.

310
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:34,470
- Hey.
- Uh, hey.

311
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,309
Did someone just knock on the door?

312
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,770
No. We going?

313
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,180
Yeah.

314
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:46,320
Okay, miscreants.

315
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,910
It's Armageddon. So die as you lived...

316
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,350
- Boring.
- Or join us

317
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,650
in an end-of-the-world soiree

318
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,949
and die legends. Your choice.

319
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:56,209
You heard the man.

320
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,570
Come on!

321
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,959
It's a tie!

322
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,589
Anything?

323
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,220
Not yet!

324
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,219
Oh!

325
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,850
♪ Gimme your control ♪

326
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,689

327
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,330
Mmm.

328
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,350
Eliot!

329
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,610
El, El.

330
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,850
You look like you saw a ghost.

331
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,869
Hey, ask it how we stop the moon.

332
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,499
- Actually, I think I might...
- Wait!

333
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,039
Oh, my God, I think I got something.

334
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,880
An idea.

335
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:42,919
Hit me.

336
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,589
Cock and balls, I forgot.

337
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:02,450
This isn't working.

338
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,570
No offense, Rajit.

339
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,029
It's Todd.

340
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,310
No.

341
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,650
Come back when you're Rajit.

342
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,369
Okay.

343
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,489
You know, I've been thinking...

344
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:15,489
clearly we need something
a little bit stronger.

345
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,999
No, we need an idea.

346
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,249
You know what?

347
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,790
I'm gonna go hydrate
and, I don't know...

348
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,539
stare at moon chunks
hurtling straight for Earth.

349
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,210
Can't be worse than discovering

350
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,886
I just jacked Todd off for
three time loops in a row.

351
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:34,259
Eliot.

352
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,270
_

353
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,019
No...

354
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,340
It's never happening.

355
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:43,130
Leave me alone.

Pardon me, Brenda. I'm gonna get this.

363
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,210
I got a lead.

364
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,230
I've been talking to this
weird oceanographer guy

365
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,030
who no joke has a dolphin harem,

366
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,210
but he also knows some
real shit about...

367
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,949
Hey, what's up with you?

368
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,199
What's up

369
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,300
is...

370
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:46,200
my brain is a snake eating its tail,

371
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:49,010
and the tail is another
snake eating its tail.

372
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,009
Jesus. Okay, you stay here.

373
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,550
I'll report back with some research.

374
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,106
_

375
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,070
I figured it out, El.

376
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,100
From talking to that dolphin fucker.

377
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,029
Everything he said checked out.

378
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:16,970
We need to go to Fisher Beach.
It's kind of out of the way.

379
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,630
Lifeguard station 17.

380
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,748
Everything I'm seeing
says the first chunk's

381
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,999
- gonna hit around 10:00 p.m...
- Eliot.

382
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,540
- We have 12 hours.
- Hey.

383
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,970
I got the answer.
You can take a breather.

384
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,870
Not right now, Margo.

385
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,000
Okay, "Leaving Las Vegas."

386
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,450
I was happy to give you space

387
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,830
to tell your Monster
secrets in your own time,

388
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,500
but we're stuck in the
Jean-Paul Sartre bullshit

389
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,950
and you're getting worse fast.

390
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,019
I told you, this isn't
important right now, okay?

391
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,099
Whatever it is, you remember
it's not your fault, okay?

392
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,200
This math is so damn frustrating.

393
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,400
Can we just stop the moon first, please?

394
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,450
Not if your liver falls
out of your twat first.

395
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,690
Let's talk about it.

396
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,770
- No.
- Seems like we have to.

397
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,180
It's me.

398
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:00,780
- Don't be a coward.
- Stop.

399
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:06,310
It's still in me, okay?

400
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,860
I am seeing what I am seeing.

401
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:15,719
Some pieces of him must've held on.

402
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,560
The Monster is gone.

403
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:20,470
I exorcised it and Q
threw it into the Seam.

404
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,610
The only thing here is you medicating

405
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,610
instead of facing your
memories and your feelings

406
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,229
and I empathize, I do.

407
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:31,280
But I think you're forgetting
you can tell me anything.

408
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:34,190
I just told you, and
you didn't believe me.

409
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,120
I love you.

410
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:38,279
Even when you're nuts.

411
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,050
But our window's 12
hours to stop the moon

412
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,620
or it's game over again,

413
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,510
and I need it to be fixed
before I go as nuts as you,

414
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,999
so just sit this round out...

415
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,459
- No.
- And I'll go alone.

416
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,830
No, no, no. Please, please.

417
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,230
I can...

418
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,709
- You can't.
- Keep it together, I can keep it together.

419
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,670
- See you yesterday.
- I can keep it together.

420
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,130
Please. No, Margo.

421
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:31,240
I'm feeling the wrong
kind of boned right now.

422
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,900
Okay.

423
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,770
I'm sorry.

424
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,670
What you said yesterday...

425
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,440
Yesterday at Westbrook's house?

426
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,770
Yesterday before you
went to Fisher Beach.

427
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,889
I didn't go to Fisher Beach.

428
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,520
- You don't...
- At around 10 p.m.

429
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:56,069
- We have 12 hours.
- You don't remember.

430
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,770
Remember that tit-chafe Marina

431
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,970
showed up and broke the moon?

432
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,950
How could I forget?

433
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:06,340
Did Josh just sneeze on the pizza?

434
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,780
So let's release that ache,

435
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:17,200
that desire for control.

436
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:19,510
Understand the moment we're in.

437
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,370
Accept our state of being.
Take a breath.

438
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,350
Send a prayer up to the god
of your understanding.

439
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,850
Send a prayer and accept.

440
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,970
Amen.

441
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,200
- Amen.
- Thank you.

442
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:36,270
You've momentarily lessened
my existential dread.

443
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,319
This may be the end.

444
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,110
No, I'm not reading this.

445
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,450
Okay, asshole.

446
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,120
Bring it.

447
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:52,410
I just wanna say...

448
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:58,120
This world is flawed.

449
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:01,560
We each have good in us... and bad.

450
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:04,590
Every day we fight to let the good win.

451
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,230
This... this is the last day.

452
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,130
Think about those who you love.

453
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,600
Turn off the TV and be with them.

454
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,430
Thank you and good...

455
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,309
I'm sorry.

456
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:19,280
Were you listening to that?

457
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:21,750
It was so depressing.

458
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,470
Not really.

459
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,890
Hey, you okay?

460
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,359
Not really.

461
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,450
Me neither.

462
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,860
Cookie?

463
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:32,460
Yeah.

464
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,760
I have to admit...

465
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,749
I don't think their spell will work.

466
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,669
It won't.

467
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:44,220
Can't believe I'm about to die.

468
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:47,510
You are, but...

469
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,800
then you'll just start all over again.

470
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,590
We're in a time loop.

471
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,780
Shut up.

472
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,020
Seriously?

473
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,650
That's a relief.

474
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,930
Like, uh, "Groundhog Day"?

475
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,190
Or "Russian Doll"?

476
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,990
Or "Happy Death Day" or
"Happy Death Day 2U"?

477
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,359
Or "Source Code"? Oh, that "X-Files".

478
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,570
The "Star Trek".

479
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,558
"Edge of Tomorrow" but really
"All You Need Is Kill"

480
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,490
and it's, like, why change
the title like that, right?

481
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,010
Wow.

482
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,660
You really love time
loop stories, don't you?

483
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,210
And you're awake in the loop.

484
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,669
You're the hero. I am totally jealous.

485
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,300
Hey, you wanna get out of here?

486
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,259
I've got this place on my bucket list

487
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,880
and well, uh... it's gotta be now.

488
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:39,320
And to Sharon Cappanelli
from ninth grade: I lied.

489
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:40,910
- Man.
- It was my tampon,

490
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:43,099
- and that was your girlfriend.
- Time loops.

491
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,939
Gnarly.

492
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:47,230
Extremely gnarly.

493
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,569
So you're talking to me about it.

494
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:51,350
Yeah.

495
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,999
As opposed to Alice, Julia, or Kady.

496
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,910
Or, to state the obvious,

497
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,461
Margo.

498
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:01,579
I kind of blew it beyond
repair with Margo.

499
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,290
How is anything beyond repair

500
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,419
when you're stuck in a time loop?

501
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,550
Well,

502
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,260
she was awake with me
for a while and then

503
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:14,560
she got kicked out somehow,
and now I am utterly alone.

504
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:17,190
Well, if I'm learning anything

505
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,530
from these squishy pierogi tacos

506
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,590
is that not everything belongs together.

507
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,281
- How can we help?
- Help save the world?

508
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,740
Honestly, I don't know.

509
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,400
It might not be possible.

510
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:37,280
This might be it.

511
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:41,920
Me, alone, in this particular 12 hours.

512
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,920
- Eternally.
- Okay.

513
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:47,730
Sounds like a lot for you.

514
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:52,339
So, uh, anything I can do to help you?

515
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,230
I wish.

516
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,910
Because the longer this goes
on, the more certain I am

517
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,639
that the Monster is inside
of me and trying to get out.

518
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,350
Good metaphor.

519
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,599
I'm being literal.

520
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,610
Oh.

521
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,689
Shit.

522
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,750
It's worse every loop.

523
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,320
I hear its voice,

524
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,730
I see blood on the walls,

525
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:17,550
I... I see this door.

526
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,740
It wants out.

527
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,659
Have you tried letting it out?

528
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,700
Why in God's name would I do that?

529
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,350
I... I... I'm just spitballing.

530
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,039
A lot of the time in these movies

531
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,030
the solution of the problem

532
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:33,560
is facing the thing
you're most afraid of.

533
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:36,390
What if I die?

534
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,390
What if you do?

535
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,060
Why?!

536
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,610
Anyway.

537
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,899
You're not upset you're about to die?

538
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:59,010
I don't love it.

539
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,369
But you'll figure out a way to fix this.

540
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,758
The world's greatest minds

541
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,820
are locked in a desperate
race to save humanity.

542
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:13,970
Everything I'm seeing says
the first chunk's gotta hit

543
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,089
around 10 p.m.

544
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:17,590
We have 12 hours.

545
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,437
What if we create a massive
portal in the atmosphere?

546
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:22,800
We'd need a specialist.

547
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,739
Charlton?

548
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,780
Well, fuck!

549
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,770
How the hell are you here?

550
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,690
I was trapped wandering
your Remembrances

551
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:39,540
when mercifully you decided
not to sleep for five days

552
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,210
and broke your brain.

553
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,640
That gave me an opening to contact you.

554
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,540
That voice?

555
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,910
That was you?

556
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,650
Yes, of course.

557
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,719
When all the scary
creatures were pulled out,

558
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,769
I held on tight as I could
in your Happy Place,

559
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,560
and, well... here we are.

560
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,110
This place was so vivid in your mind,

561
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,940
but there is nothing like
the real thing, is there?

562
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:05,810
The sights, the sounds, the...

563
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,079
smells!

564
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,789
Oh, I forgot about smells, Eliot.

565
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,620
They're overwhelmingly unpleasant.

566
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,190
Those messages? That was you, too?

567
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,419
"I'm still here"?

568
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,040
"Let me out"?

569
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:20,090
Yes.

570
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,770
I wanted you to know
that I was still here

571
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,160
and I wanted to be let out.

572
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:25,860
In red paint?

573
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:28,139
Right, like strawberries
and Santa Claus.

574
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,809
And blood, Charlton.

575
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:31,429
Well, perhaps it was a touch ominous.

576
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,019
As was the creepy whisper.

577
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,060
- I was trying to be polite.
- Well...

578
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:41,010
It is nice to have a
non-imaginary imaginary friend

579
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,279
for the end of the world, I guess.

580
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,359
Half-imaginary.

581
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,529
I was passenger in your unconscious.

582
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:50,860
Now, I'm still in your head.

583
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,930
But the conscious part?

584
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:56,000
I can't tell you how much
of an improvement this is.

585
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,760
Your Happy Place is nice

586
00:27:57,770 --> 00:28:00,799
and I was able to see
everything you were doing here,

587
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,670
but...

588
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,670
well, there's no substitute
for being heard.

589
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,790
Especially since I often
disagree with your choices,

590
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,179
and I'd like to share my opinions.

591
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,190
Oh, that's peachy.

592
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,740
Well, let's start now.

593
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,559
Opinion on what to do next?

594
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,439
Oh, well, I'd think that's obvious.

595
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,520
Is it?

596
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:22,770
In case you didn't notice,

597
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,450
Margo was sort of driving
the bus on this whole thing

598
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,859
before I screwed up and lost her.

599
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:28,699
You didn't lose her, Eliot.

600
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,070
She's out of the loops, Charlton.

601
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,450
No, I simply mean I don't
think that's about you.

602
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:38,249
I think she got too close to the answer.

603
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,890
Perhaps that's why

604
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,000
she was thrown from your
shared loop experience.

605
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:46,299
That does have the ring of logic to it.

606
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,389
Margo mentioned a beach, did she not?

607
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,720
Fisher Beach.

608
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:55,050
Okay.

609
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,519
Let's go.

610
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,260
Why is there no one here?

611
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:03,439
I think it's a cancel-your-beach-trip
kind of day today.

612
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,219
Psst... keep your eyes peeled

613
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:08,109
for anyone or anything who
might not want us here.

614
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,030
Is that phone wire?

615
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:22,339
Are phones generally used underwater?

616
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:29,630
I think we got a lead.

617
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,570
Lifeguard station 17.

618
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,738
That's the same track Margo was on.

619
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,890
This didn't go well for her,

620
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,978
so perhaps we should discuss
before going in there, okay?

621
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,890
Ovary up, Charlton.

622
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:51,010
Uh...

623
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,319
I guess...

624
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,200
off and whales?

625
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,881
What is the purpose of this distraction?

626
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:01,342
With whom are we speaking?

627
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,379
We are the whales.

628
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:07,460
Like... all of them?

629
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:09,170
Of course.

630
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,719
Why do you speak through a TV?

631
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,080
Why do you?

632
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:14,599
What is the nature of your query?

633
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,350
Okay, I don't really know
how to explain this.

634
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,050
Um...

635
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,709
okay, so you probably don't know this,

636
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,939
but we... we are in a time loop.

637
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,319
We are aware of the disturbance.

638
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,200
Oh, huh.

639
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:30,290
Whales grok time loops.

640
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,399
So do you happen to remember

641
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,610
if a woman named Margo came to see you?

642
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,860
Uh, brilliant, about yea high,
maybe a little brusque.

643
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,740
A contemptuous creature.

644
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:42,459
We were compelled to wash
away her temporal immunity.

645
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:45,950
You took her Permanence off.

646
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,330
Why?

647
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,340
Her manner was appalling.

648
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:52,650
That...

649
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,060
does sound like Margo, okay.

650
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:58,020
I apologize for her bedside
manner, and I just...

651
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:02,030
I humbly and I respectfully
ask, do you...

652
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:05,280
do you have any insight into
this loop that we're in?

653
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,270
Our magic caused it.

654
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,439
You're... magicians?

655
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:15,369
Pay attention! We will explain once.

656
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:18,050
Our ancestors made a
pact with the Old Gods

657
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,399
and so we spend our lives

658
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,879
tracing sigils into the ocean floor.

659
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,380
This task is crucial.

660
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,740
Why?

661
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:31,990
To ensure the Kraken stays dormant.

662
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,990
Like the... the Kraken-kraken?

663
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,719
What's a Kraken-kraken?

664
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,450
Should the Kraken ever awaken

665
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,429
it would soon consume the world.

666
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:44,210
Okay, got it.

667
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,640
So, the loops. Why?

668
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:48,270
The moon colliding with Earth

669
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,050
obliterated our protective sigils

670
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,390
causing the Kraken to rise.

671
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:55,579
Kinda seems like a hat on a hat

672
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,319
when you've already got
a moon apocalypse.

673
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,030
A bit flippant for a creature

674
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,869
who caused said apocalypse.

675
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:04,790
Fortunately, our ancestors
implemented a failsafe.

676
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,649
If the Kraken awakens,
it sends Earth back 12 hours

677
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:11,270
to allow another chance
to avert catastrophe.

678
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:13,900
Whereupon it'll all just keep happening

679
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,919
because the fucking moon is broken.

680
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,809
So it would seem.

681
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:20,400
Well... uh... well,
if you're... if you're magicians,

682
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:22,960
then maybe you can help fix the moon?

683
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,200
We cannot.

684
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:26,170
We must maintain our sigils.

685
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,810
Okay.

686
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:31,720
If you don't fix the moon,
the Kraken's just...

687
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:33,050
just gonna keep krakening.

688
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,849
This distraction has gone on too long.

689
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:35,890
Wait... no, no, no.

690
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,300
We must attend to the sigils.

691
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,859
- Hold on.
- Do not contact us again.

692
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,860
No, no, no, no, no.

693
00:32:39,861 --> 00:32:41,319
No!

694
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:44,120
Uh...

695
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,640
oh, shit.

696
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:52,480
Feeling the wrong kind
of boned right now.

697
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:54,290
Oh, okay.

698
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,730
Bye, I guess.

699
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,080
What am I supposed to do?

700
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:04,550
I can't fix the moon. That won't work.

701
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,280
You can't help, you're non-corporeal.

702
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:08,529
True.

703
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,360
But...

704
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,350
you're not alone.

705
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:22,969
So whales really are powerful magicians.

706
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:25,009
I knew they did weird
stuff on the ocean floor,

707
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:27,299
- I just didn't realize it was...
- Wait. Yes, Alice...

708
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,020
tell me what else you know about whales.

709
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:30,600
Um...

710
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:32,720
their closest cousin is the hippo.

711
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:35,130
Um, their mating season is in the fall.

712
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,790
That is so sad for them.

713
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,590
What if they never get
to make love again?

714
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,600
Though I am one to talk.

715
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:41,028
I mean, it's been over a thousand years.

716
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,620
That's not exactly what I needed.

717
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,500
Well, you asked me what I knew.

718
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,379
Is there any info about the Kraken

719
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:47,820
that might point us in a direction?

720
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,620
Whoa-ho-ho! Okay.

721
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:54,020
Well, you have your
Lovecraftian god-Krakens.

722
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:56,709
Uh, and then there's the D&D Kraken

723
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:57,990
which is sort of six-of-one.

724
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,540
And then, of course,
there's "Clash of the Titans",

725
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,759
- both the original and the remake.
- Thank you.

726
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,629
With the very famous line...

727
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:06,878
Thank you, Josh.

728
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,930
Every time the Kraken awakens,

729
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,380
time jumps back 12 hours.

730
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:12,858
Which would be great if it took us back

731
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,090
to before the moon broke.

732
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:18,350
What if we get the time
loop spell to trigger

733
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,930
a couple hours early?

734
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:22,219
Why don't we just kill
all the damn whales?

735
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,499
Well, that's clearly
what you tried to do

736
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,939
when they took away your Permanence.

737
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:28,010
But she's right.

738
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:31,219
Maybe we need to let out
the thing that scares us.

739
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,779
Maybe we need to, uh, to...

740
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,989
Release the Kraken!

741
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:37,400
Exactly, yeah.

742
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:38,450
But earlier.

743
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:42,789
Early... early enough to
a time before the heist.

744
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,659
Shit, we're almost out of time.

745
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,369
Look, if the whales have the power

746
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:54,460
to take away your Permanence,
this could be your last shot.

747
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:57,679
No presh, but you're our only hope.

748
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,599
I will do my very best.

749
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,359
Surely, you jest.

750
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,490
I know, I know.

751
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,049
It goes against everything
you've ever believed in,

752
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,409
and I fully respect that,

753
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,280
but the only way to fix this

754
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:25,660
is to release the Kraken right now.

755
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,998
Well, I don't think they liked that.

756
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,070
What? No.

757
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,669
Damn it!

758
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,540
Eliot?

759
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,629
Please be careful.

760
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,088
Uh, you don't know what they will do.

761
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:39,540
Hey!

762
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:42,391
You know I'm right!

763
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,250
I know you're listening.

764
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,090
You know, I have it on good authority

765
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,160
that mating season is in the fall.

766
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:53,819
Do you never wanna fuck again?

767
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:56,029
- Eliot, that was too personal.
- Uh...

768
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:58,739
okay, uh, sorry.

769
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,860
Look, I get it.

770
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:03,869
Look, I get it... your
ancestors made a deal,

771
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,240
but special circumstances, okay?

772
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,710
Just let it out for 30 seconds.

773
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,320
I will fix this and then, you know, uh,

774
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:15,120
the Kraken will be back in
its safe little sea bed

775
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:18,799
and, uh, you can maintain
your sigils for all of eternity.

776
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,299
You gotta trust me.

777
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,389
Just release the goddamn Kraken.

778
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:26,810
Please, please, please, please, please.

779
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:30,680
Look.

780
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,959
Hi there!

781
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,560
Uh...

782
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:59,419
are you the Kraken?

783
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,160
No.

784
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:09,970
Josh, Margo, Penny.

785
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,870
You guys go inside,
loop all the cameras,

786
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,269
open the side door for Natasha.

787
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:15,710
I'll be outside waiting
with Eliot and Alice.

788
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,120
Holy shit.

789
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,160
Holy shit.

790
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,360
Holy shit.

791
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,700
This is before the moon broke.

792
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,990
It worked.

793
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,579
- Okay, break.
- Sorry.

794
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:33,560
Um, could you just, uh... could you...

795
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,199
You're freaking out, aren't you?

796
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,030
- No.
- Look, you can pull the ripcord now.

797
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,790
- Get out, we'll handle this.
- Margo.

798
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,200
Credenza.

799
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:45,719
Don't ask questions,
just do what you say?

800
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,040
Mm-hmm.

801
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:49,509
Fine.

802
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:51,310
Okay.

803
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,630
Slight change of plans.

804
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,709
We are so close to saving everyone.

805
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,600
You can't take that away from us now.

806
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:59,120
Look, whatever it is you're after

807
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:00,949
what's the point if
there's no world left?

808
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:04,530
There'll still be a world,
just not as many people.

809
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,990
Have you met people?

810
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,329
I've met people, many people.

811
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,089
How many people have you met?

812
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:13,959
Because I bet I've met more people.

813
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,370
What the fuck is wrong with you?

814
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,171
Hi.

815
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,673
What the hell did...

816
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:23,349
Hell, yes.

817
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:28,439
What the... how did you...

818
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,810
Julia, now.

819
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,580
Hey!

820
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,940
Hot pizza!

821
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:59,780
That's one pizza we
definitely can enjoy.

822
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:02,480
All right. Oh, nice pour right there.

823
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,040
Yes, cheers, cheers, yes.

824
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:07,910
Bam!

825
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,479
- All right, Emeril.
- Fresco pizza!

826
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,890
Yes, cheers.

827
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,090
Whoo!

828
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,570
You don't want a drink?

829
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:28,910
Actually, I desperately do not.

830
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,680
That's concerning. Those time loops

831
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:32,370
must've really did a number on you.

832
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:36,300
So...

833
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:38,793
You're right, I have
been pushing you away.

834
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:41,510
Yeah, no shit.

835
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:44,920
It's just...

836
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:51,932
I do remember the Monster.

837
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:57,300
It was bad and bloody and, um...

838
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,210
Those memories are, like, right here.

839
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:04,420
And, um...

840
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:06,108
you know, maybe I really
do need that drink.

841
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:08,959
I don't get why you feel like
you have to go it alone.

842
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,079
I don't either.

843
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:18,139
My logical brain knows without a doubt

844
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,160
that I'm better with you.

845
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:20,829
Yes, and same.

846
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,110
Tell your coping
mechanisms to back off...

847
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,139
Or I'll punch 'em in the dick.

848
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:35,949
During the loops, we were in it together

849
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:38,490
and then you were gone, and...

850
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,280
shocking revelation...

851
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:42,090
I am utterly miserable
when you're not around.

852
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:44,630
Yeah, I know.

853
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,309
I don't know if that's fair to you.

854
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,930
What are you talking about?

855
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,239
The other thing I learned

856
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,910
being in the loops with
you for so long...

857
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,859
you're not exactly who you used to be.

858
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:57,950
You've...

859
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,359
Please don't say aged.

860
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:03,350
You've evolved, Margo Hanson.

861
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,160
You've become more of your true self.

862
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:07,080
You've earned it.

863
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:12,430
And I don't want to ask
you to take a step back

864
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,160
just so I can try and catch up.

865
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:16,266
Oh.

866
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:18,560
I was a mess you had
to untangle in there

867
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:23,440
just so you could soldier on,
and... once you did,

868
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:25,480
you figured out how to fix all of this.

869
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:26,900
And then you picked up the baton

870
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:28,179
and actually did the thing.

871
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,950
- I got lucky.
- No.

872
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:38,490
It's 'cause you understand
me better than anyone.

873
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:39,820
Mm-hmm.

874
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:45,050
So quit acting like you're the
screw-up and get on my level, El.

875
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:50,470
You did it.

876
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,530
You did when the world was on the line,

877
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,170
now do it for yourself.

878
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:05,479
I don't know if I want
to get on your level

879
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,210
knowing that you jacked off Todd.

880
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,890
- I did not.
- Yeah, you did.

881
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:12,980
I did not.

882
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,621
The hell?

883
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:21,000
Coming.

884
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:24,370
Oh, thank God!

885
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:27,500
I've tried every other magical
Penthouse in the city and...

886
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:30,420
Todd. Wh... uh, what...

887
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:31,690
Why are you here?

888
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,820
I need your help.

889
00:42:32,830 --> 00:42:35,420
Something just happened that
feels way above my pay grade,

890
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:36,758
and you were the first
person I thought of

891
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,910
who could help me handle it.

892
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,609
Okay, it's a weird one.
Just hear me out, okay?

893
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:44,740
So this pig dude who kind of looks like

894
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:46,560
that one guy Paul Giamatti played

895
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:47,990
in that one show with all the wigs

896
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,719
told me I'm supposed to do a quest.

897
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,330
Seriously?

898
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,329
That asshole went to you?

899
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:55,180
Wow. Ha.

900
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:57,809
Yeah, he's extremely
committed to finding a dude.

901
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:00,899
Yeah, it's fine, Todd. We fixed it.

902
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:04,110
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yes, I'm sure.

903
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,310
The Harmonic Convergence
isn't happening anymore.

904
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,819
The who now?

905
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,469
The end of the world?

906
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:10,980
Uh, no.

907
00:43:10,990 --> 00:43:14,460
He did say the end of
something but not that.

908
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:16,180
He was talking about Fillory.

909
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:18,290
Remind me, is Fillory real?

910
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,960
The end of Fillory?

911
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:24,820
So...

912
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:27,120
so we saved the wrong world?

913
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,190
So we're not done.

914
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:38,120
Of course.
