1
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:08,319
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,169
You're not right, El,
and we both know why.

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,469
You said you don't remember
what happened

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,090
when you were possessed, but Julia does.

5
00:00:13,097 --> 00:00:14,430
And I don't.

6
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:17,308
I don't know why you're
accusing me of lying.

7
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:20,395
Eliot, let me out.

8
00:00:20,396 --> 00:00:21,771
We're looking for Stoppard.

9
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:23,469
Mom? Mom, what's wrong?

10
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:25,599
Moms die every day. Circle of life.

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,486
We know you're trying to
look out for your mom.

12
00:00:27,487 --> 00:00:28,945
You're saying you'll leave?

13
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:30,572
Sorry, man. I'm not going anywhere.

14
00:00:30,573 --> 00:00:32,639
The Harmonic Convergence.

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,070
AKA the end of the world.

16
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:37,370
The convergence will only occur
during this perfect alignment.

17
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:40,059
If we move the moon out of position...

18
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,080
No Convergence,
no Circumstance, no apocalypse.

19
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:45,502
If you have moon brain,
then you will see Her aura.

20
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:47,589
If it is green, She is listening.

21
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,259
Only then may you ask Her to move.

22
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,559
You will need a piece of Her.

23
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,928
Like a moon rock?

24
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,305
In here, boss.

25
00:00:55,306 --> 00:00:57,473
Ladies.

26
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,601
- You're moving the moon?
- Yeah.

27
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:05,732
Uh, guys?

28
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:07,720
I think we broke the moon.

29
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,879
NASA estimates just hours

30
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,519
before the first pieces
reach our atmosphere.

31
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,879
In a tweet, the president
stressed the need for calm,

32
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,289
saying, "We will fix
the moon decisively.

33
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:24,490
The American people have
absolutely nothing to fear."

34
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:34,799
I know we are dealing with
the lunapocalypse problem,

35
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:37,472
but I have to insist that
we all take a minute

36
00:01:37,473 --> 00:01:40,683
for a little self-care/pizza, okay?

37
00:01:40,684 --> 00:01:41,809
Okay.

38
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,739
Cautioning everyone
that though the world

39
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,509
appears to be coming to an end,

40
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,719
everyone's behavior
will still be counted

41
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,519
when the time comes for judgment.

42
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,839
Feeling the wrong kind
of boned right now.

43
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,709
At least the Harmonic Convergence

44
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,269
isn't happening anymore.

45
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,769
I just have this bad feeling.

46
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,319
Hey.

47
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,279
We'll figure out how to stop this.

48
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,919
I mean, on the off-chance
the president doesn't.

49
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,963
Let's review.

50
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,633
Emergency code words if
this all goes shit-shaped?

51
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,629
Um...

52
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,979
- Really?
- Kidding. Okay.

53
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,299
As follows.

54
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,629
"Credenza," no questions asked.

55
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,279
"Inglenook," tie those fools up,

56
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,899
toss 'em through the Fillory portal.

57
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,709
"Chifforobe," flee to Canada.

58
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:29,639
"Armoire," shield up, stat.

59
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,659
"Kimono"...

60
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,310
All hell has broken loose.

61
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,321
Time and hope are quickly running out.

62
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:38,075
Everything I'm seeing says
the first chunk's gonna hit

63
00:02:38,076 --> 00:02:39,240
around 10:00 p.m.

64
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,745
We have 12 hours.

65
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,759
Uh, look.

66
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,959
What if we created a massive
portal in the atmosphere?

67
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,529
No, we need a specialist,

68
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,469
and the meta-math is just... it's too...

69
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,258
this is really bad, Julia.

70
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:57,051
Nuh-uh.

71
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,512
Don't you dare give up.

72
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,159
This math is so damn frustrating.

73
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,250
Yeah, but you'll get it.

74
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,560
Jesus.

75
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,854
- What happened to your shoe?
- Have you been out there?

76
00:03:09,855 --> 00:03:12,400
It is the literal end
of the actual world.

77
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:13,989
No, it's not. We're gonna stop it.

78
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,479
Yeah, tell that to the rioters
and the prayer circles

79
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,280
and people fucking in the streets.

80
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:19,991
I can't believe this is happening.

81
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:22,069
I'm just numb.

82
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:25,456
Try the truffled prosciutto,
it's incredible.

83
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,583
I did have one idea

84
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:30,833
after my very bad idea
to take the subway.

85
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:33,879
Okay, do you know Richard's
Reverse Entropy spell?

86
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,948
We already talked about it.

87
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,298
Unfortunately, it's just way too small.

88
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,669
True, but I reworked it.

89
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:41,346
And check my math.

90
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,969
This is fantastic, but...

91
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,562
I don't think we have enough
cooperative power.

92
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:51,857
Chances are high for a surge
in the next 12 hours.

93
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,442
- We could use it.
- And we have enough hedges

94
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:58,613
around the world on standby
to do it with us, so...

95
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:00,529
That might not be enough.

96
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,200
We make it enough.

97
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:03,951
Today we are saving the world,

98
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,953
and this time it's gonna stick.

99
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,580
Damn right, we are.

100
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,373
Okay.

101
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,003
But just in case...

102
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,006
Anything I need to say to you?

103
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,716
Jules, we're good.

104
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,539
Scientists around the world

105
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,959
have been sending out their predictions

106
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,100
for what we should expect
in the coming hours.

107
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,686
Though the tides remain
mysteriously intact,

108
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,059
expect volcanic activity,

109
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,108
tectonic shifts,
disrupted weather patterns,

110
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,528
and strange behavior from animal life.

111
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,879
And to Sharon Cappanelli
from ninth grade:

112
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,979
I lied.

113
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,479
It was my tampon, and
that was your girlfriend.

114
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,497
I'm not sorry.

115
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:51,599
Thanks for spreading the word, Pete.

116
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,625
Stand by.

117
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,320
Everyone's set.

118
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,039
We're just waiting for the surge.

119
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,103
You guys feel that?

120
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,062
It's the surge.

121
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,605
It's cresting. We should...

122
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,349
Go. Pete, now!

123
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,169
Did it work?

124
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,919
It didn't work.

125
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,389
We failed.

126
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:59,620

127
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,579
Feeling the wrong kind of boned...

128
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,149
right now.

129
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,719
At least the Harmonic Convergence

130
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,399
isn't happening anymore.

131
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,799
Although the world's greatest minds

132
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,199
are locked in a desperate
race to save humanity

133
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,159
from this sudden lunar cataclysm,

134
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,899
time and hope are quickly running out.

135
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,759
Everything I'm seeing
says the first chunk's

136
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,139
gonna hit around 10:00 p.m.

137
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,800
We have 12 hours.

138
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:37,260
Uh, look, what if we created a
massive portal in the atmosphere?

139
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,275
We need a specialist, and the
meta-math is just... it's too...

140
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:43,569
- this is really bad, Julia.
- Am I crazy, or...

141
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,779
This already happened, right?

142
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,219
This math is so damn frustrating.

143
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,240
This did.

144
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,451
This did already happen.

145
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,202
Ow!

146
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:52,689
Not a dream.

147
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,079
Hey, am I on something,

148
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,084
or did we try this plan yesterday?

149
00:06:57,085 --> 00:06:58,239
We're...

150
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,169
At Westbrook's estate?

151
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,090
Jesus.

152
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:06,592
What happened to your shoe?

153
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,689
Have you been out there?

154
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,919
It's the literal end
of the actual world.

155
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,859
No, it's not. We're stopping it.

156
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,719
Tell that to the rioters,
prayer circles,

157
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,029
and people fucking in the streets.

158
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,648
We're in a time loop.

159
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,480
Excuse us while we briefly sidebar.

160
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,990
Why exactly is this happening?

161
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:30,032
"Why is anything?" he asked,

162
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:31,779
still freaked, 'cause the
last thing he remembers

163
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,399
is all of Earth ending.

164
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,149
- It felt so inevitable.
- I know.

165
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:38,409
But why us, now? Time loop?

166
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:41,149
Of course we're the chosen ones.

167
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:42,170
We're us.

168
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:45,089
Okay, everybody.

169
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,591
What is going on with you two?

170
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:48,859
Quick recap, Kady's plan won't work.

171
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,099
We tried it, and the moon
still crashed into the Earth.

172
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,974
Uh, okay. What do you mean, "tried it"?

173
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:57,101
We suspect we're in a time loop.

174
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,394
How?

175
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,169
Obviously...

176
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,720
the moon's a wily cunt
who doesn't wanna die.

177
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:04,599
Okay.

178
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,939
All right, so no reverse entropy.

179
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,072
What do you guys suggest?

180
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,689
We cast Vinnola's Oxygen
Saver on Penny 23,

181
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,029
then he travels to the moon.

182
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,339
It's easier to do a portal there.

183
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,619
Look, GPS is kinda broken.

184
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,165
- I might end up in a wall.
- It's the apocalypse.

185
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,989
Gonna need you to try.

186
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,880
Fuck all of you. Fine.

187
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:32,762
You got this, man.

188
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,539
Oh... oh, no! No! No!

189
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,116
Okay, forget the moon.
Let's move the Earth.

190
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,959
Kady, get your hedge
bitches on the horn.

191
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,780
- We got cooperating to do.
- I'm on it.

192
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,375
Okay. I found a spell that can hold

193
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,169
the pieces in suspension, we just...

194
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,922
right, good to assume we can
all do sphincter magic?

195
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,015
Could we make this very big?

196
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:21,769
Mother-shit!

197
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,271
You... you okay?

198
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,999
No, Julia. I'm not okay.

199
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,024
Bless you.

200
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,152
Whoa.

201
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:31,359
Allow me to explain.

202
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,899
So here we are, eight loops in.

203
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,160
Ten.

204
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,399
If these loops sent us back
even a little earlier,

205
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,119
we could stop Marina from bad-touching

206
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,123
this whole situation, but we can't.

207
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,581
Okay, so we need time magic.

208
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,559
I know a horomancer who builds machines.

209
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,939
- Maybe he has something.
- Fantastic, vámanos.

210
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,630
One problem... I kind of let his
mom die last time I saw him.

211
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:51,970
Oh.

212
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,679
Oh, come on.

213
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,419
Like you guys are all saints?

214
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:59,339
You're in a time loop?

215
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,379
- Well, why you two?
- 'Cause we're the best-looking.

216
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:04,299
Here. This is Penny's address.

217
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,599
Margo, what are you doing?

218
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,939
Favorite coffee shop,

219
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,105
hipster club where we suspect
he DJ's on the weekend,

220
00:10:09,106 --> 00:10:11,499
and it's your lucky day...
his Travelling's borked,

221
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,195
so he's a sitting duck in a scarf.

222
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,439
Margo, we can't just kill Penny.

223
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,279
We don't; he dies anyway,
along with everyone.

224
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,309
This is basic trolley problem shit.

225
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,369
Ovary up.

226
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,099
- Okay.
- If I wanted revenge on Penny,

227
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,876
I would've gotten that a long time ago.

228
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:32,339
You've got particles all over you.

229
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,339
Were you spritzed with something?

230
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,551
Spritzed, like with what?

231
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,129
Something that nebulized

232
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,888
a cloud of temporal
permanence around you?

233
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:40,459
Mm.

234
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,058
"Permanence."

235
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:44,999
For men and women.

236
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,062
Yeah, I may have accidentally stolen

237
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:50,439
a weird perfume bottle from
a time witch in Fillory.

238
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,309
Okay, whatever you really did,

239
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:53,790
it's created a field around you both

240
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,799
that would explain why you're...

241
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,822
in a time loop.

242
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:59,117
Ah. And here we thought we were special.

243
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,319
- What are you doing?
- Helping.

244
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,706
You said it's the end
of the world, right?

245
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:07,679
- That is right.
- I think I can hop you guys back

246
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,877
a full 48 hours so you can prevent this.

247
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:11,670
Oh, really? Just like that?

248
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,379
Well, it's really goddamn complicated,

249
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,210
but I'm a genius.

250
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,677
- Oh.
- Oh.

251
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:21,009
Here we go.

252
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,644
Are we time traveling right now?

253
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,104
The hell?

254
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,219
What's wrong?

255
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,939
Nothing's working... at all.

256
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:36,239
- Are you saying your shit's broken?
- I hope so.

257
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,589
The alternative is...

258
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:39,740
all time magic's in
some kind of lockdown.

259
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:40,908
What could even do that?

260
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:43,169
Something powerful...

261
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,203
and ancient.

262
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,330
You mean like the moon?

263
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:49,750
Maybe if I just fix this and
bypass the oscillation...

264
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,293
Hey, no rush, but in 30 seconds,

265
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:53,199
we're all gonna die.

266
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,381
This'll get you there.

267
00:11:54,382 --> 00:11:56,099
Not in one piece, but...

268
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,299
Wait, what?

269
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,261
Shit.

270
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:02,012
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, well.

271
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,599
I cannot believe we didn't consider

272
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,799
going to Jane Chatwin first.

273
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,999
Well, she is a person that
may be upset with us.

274
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,526
Yes.

275
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,190
- No.
- Huh.

276
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:19,781
Time magic's locked down,

277
00:12:19,782 --> 00:12:22,574
and the portal to Fillory's blocked.

278
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,509
This smacks of a
not-so-random coincidence.

279
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,989
Okay.

280
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:31,709
We can still get there.
Penny can't do shit.

281
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,489
What about that other
Traveller dickbucket,

282
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,219
- Gavin what's-his-name?
- Everything I'm seeing

283
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,546
says the first chunk's gonna
hit around 10:00 p.m....

284
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:39,300
We know! 12 hours.

285
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:41,885
We're seeing this wrong.
We're missing something.

286
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,469
Uh, maybe we need to take a step back.

287
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,499
Start thinking outside the box.

288
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,199
- What do you suggest?
- Remember Professor Soto?

289
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,659
- Oh, the one with the pants?
- Yeah.

290
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,119
He had that ridiculous test

291
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,230
everyone thought was impossible.

292
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:55,607
That we solved because we rule.

293
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,565
- Solved how?
- You want me to remember

294
00:12:57,566 --> 00:12:59,379
a solution I came up with at a rager

295
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,489
doing upside-down shots in a fur bikini?

296
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,279
You say rager,

297
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,749
I say problem-solving session.

298
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,869
That's how we do:

299
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,019
we put our minds on something different

300
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,499
and we catch the solution out
of the corner of our eye.

301
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,519
So is this actually a plan

302
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,918
or do you just wanna blow off steam?

303
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,359
Two birds, Bambi.

304
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,715
Besides, we're stuck in a game
that keeps hitting reset.

305
00:13:18,716 --> 00:13:22,059
Infinite time, zero consequences.

306
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,929
Just you and me saving the world

307
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,269
through unbridled hedonism.

308
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:28,682
Mm, fun. Let's do it.

309
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,279
Eliot.

310
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,939
- Hey.
- Uh, hey.

311
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,777
Did someone just knock on the door?

312
00:13:38,778 --> 00:13:40,236
No. We going?

313
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,640
Yeah.

314
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,789
Okay, miscreants.

315
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:51,379
It's Armageddon. So die as you lived...

316
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,819
- Boring.
- Or join us

317
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,119
in an end-of-the-world soiree

318
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,418
and die legends. Your choice.

319
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,670
You heard the man.

320
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,039
Come on!

321
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,427
It's a tie!

322
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,054
Anything?

323
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,681
Not yet!

324
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:12,684
Oh!

325
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,310
♪ Gimme your control ♪

326
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,156

327
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,799
Mmm.

328
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,819
Eliot!

329
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,079
El, El.

330
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,319
You look like you saw a ghost.

331
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,335
Hey, ask it how we stop the moon.

332
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:39,962
- Actually, I think I might...
- Wait!

333
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:42,506
Oh, my God, I think I got something.

334
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,349
An idea.

335
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,384
Hit me.

336
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,054
Cock and balls, I forgot.

337
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,904
This isn't working.

338
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,031
No offense, Rajit.

339
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,491
It's Todd.

340
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:10,779
No.

341
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,119
Come back when you're Rajit.

342
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,788
Okay.

343
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,956
You know, I've been thinking...

344
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:17,958
clearly we need something
a little bit stronger.

345
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,460
No, we need an idea.

346
00:15:19,461 --> 00:15:20,711
You know what?

347
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:23,259
I'm gonna go hydrate
and, I don't know...

348
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:26,005
stare at moon chunks
hurtling straight for Earth.

349
00:15:26,006 --> 00:15:27,679
Can't be worse than discovering

350
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,304
I just jacked Todd off for
three time loops in a row.

351
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,727
Eliot.

352
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:37,739
_

353
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,480
No...

354
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:42,809
It's never happening.

355
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:45,599

Pardon me, Brenda. I'm gonna get this.

363
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,679
I got a lead.

364
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,699
I've been talking to this
weird oceanographer guy

365
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,499
who no joke has a dolphin harem,

366
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,679
but he also knows some
real shit about...

367
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,416
Hey, what's up with you?

368
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,668
What's up

369
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:44,769
is...

370
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:48,669
my brain is a snake eating its tail,

371
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,479
and the tail is another
snake eating its tail.

372
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,470
Jesus. Okay, you stay here.

373
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:56,015
I'll report back with some research.

374
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,525
_

375
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,539
I figured it out, El.

376
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,569
From talking to that dolphin fucker.

377
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:15,492
Everything he said checked out.

378
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:19,439
We need to go to Fisher Beach.
It's kind of out of the way.

379
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,090
Lifeguard station 17.

380
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,209
Everything I'm seeing
says the first chunk's

381
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,461
- gonna hit around 10:00 p.m...
- Eliot.

382
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,009
- We have 12 hours.
- Hey.

383
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:31,439
I got the answer.
You can take a breather.

384
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,339
Not right now, Margo.

385
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,460
Okay, "Leaving Las Vegas."

386
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,919
I was happy to give you space

387
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,299
to tell your Monster
secrets in your own time,

388
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,969
but we're stuck in the
Jean-Paul Sartre bullshit

389
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,419
and you're getting worse fast.

390
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,480
I told you, this isn't
important right now, okay?

391
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:48,567
Whatever it is, you remember
it's not your fault, okay?

392
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,669
This math is so damn frustrating.

393
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,869
Can we just stop the moon first, please?

394
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,919
Not if your liver falls
out of your twat first.

395
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,159
Let's talk about it.

396
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,239
- No.
- Seems like we have to.

397
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,649
It's me.

398
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:03,249
- Don't be a coward.
- Stop.

399
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:08,779
It's still in me, okay?

400
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,329
I am seeing what I am seeing.

401
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,180
Some pieces of him must've held on.

402
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:20,029
The Monster is gone.

403
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:22,939
I exorcised it and Q
threw it into the Seam.

404
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,079
The only thing here is you medicating

405
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,079
instead of facing your
memories and your feelings

406
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,692
and I empathize, I do.

407
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:33,749
But I think you're forgetting
you can tell me anything.

408
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,658
I just told you, and
you didn't believe me.

409
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,589
I love you.

410
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:40,743
Even when you're nuts.

411
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:43,519
But our window's 12
hours to stop the moon

412
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,089
or it's game over again,

413
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,979
and I need it to be fixed
before I go as nuts as you,

414
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,461
so just sit this round out...

415
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:50,921
- No.
- And I'll go alone.

416
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:52,299
No, no, no. Please, please.

417
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,699
I can...

418
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,174
- You can't.
- Keep it together, I can keep it together.

419
00:18:56,175 --> 00:18:58,139
- See you yesterday.
- I can keep it together.

420
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,597
Please. No, Margo.

421
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,709
I'm feeling the wrong
kind of boned right now.

422
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,369
Okay.

423
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:37,239
I'm sorry.

424
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,139
What you said yesterday...

425
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,909
Yesterday at Westbrook's house?

426
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,230
Yesterday before you
went to Fisher Beach.

427
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,350
I didn't go to Fisher Beach.

428
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,989
- You don't...
- At around 10 p.m.

429
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:58,530
- We have 12 hours.
- You don't remember.

430
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:00,239
Remember that tit-chafe Marina

431
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,439
showed up and broke the moon?

432
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,411
How could I forget?

433
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:08,809
Did Josh just sneeze on the pizza?

434
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,629
So let's release that ache,

435
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:21,049
that desire for control.

436
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,359
Understand the moment we're in.

437
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,219
Accept our state of being.
Take a breath.

438
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:30,199
Send a prayer up to the god
of your understanding.

439
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,699
Send a prayer and accept.

440
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,819
Amen.

441
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,049
- Amen.
- Thank you.

442
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:40,119
You've momentarily lessened
my existential dread.

443
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:47,162
This may be the end.

444
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,959
No, I'm not reading this.

445
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,299
Okay, asshole.

446
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,969
Bring it.

447
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:56,250
I just wanna say...

448
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,969
This world is flawed.

449
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,409
We each have good in us... and bad.

450
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:08,439
Every day we fight to let the good win.

451
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,079
This... this is the last day.

452
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,979
Think about those who you love.

453
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,449
Turn off the TV and be with them.

454
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,276
Thank you and good...

455
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,154
I'm sorry.

456
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:23,129
Were you listening to that?

457
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:25,599
It was so depressing.

458
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,319
Not really.

459
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,739
Hey, you okay?

460
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,205
Not really.

461
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:32,299
Me neither.

462
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,709
Cookie?

463
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,309
Yeah.

464
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,609
I have to admit...

465
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,592
I don't think their spell will work.

466
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:45,512
It won't.

467
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:48,056
Can't believe I'm about to die.

468
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:51,359
You are, but...

469
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,647
then you'll just start all over again.

470
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,439
We're in a time loop.

471
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,629
Shut up.

472
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:01,863
Seriously?

473
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:04,499
That's a relief.

474
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,779
Like, uh, "Groundhog Day"?

475
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,039
Or "Russian Doll"?

476
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,839
Or "Happy Death Day" or
"Happy Death Day 2U"?

477
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,203
Or "Source Code"? Oh, that "X-Files".

478
00:22:14,204 --> 00:22:15,419
The "Star Trek".

479
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,399
"Edge of Tomorrow" but really
"All You Need Is Kill"

480
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,339
and it's, like, why change
the title like that, right?

481
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,859
Wow.

482
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,509
You really love time
loop stories, don't you?

483
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,059
And you're awake in the loop.

484
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,513
You're the hero. I am totally jealous.

485
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:34,145
Hey, you wanna get out of here?

486
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,105
I've got this place on my bucket list

487
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,729
and well, uh... it's gotta be now.

488
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:43,160
And to Sharon Cappanelli
from ninth grade: I lied.

489
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,759
- Man.
- It was my tampon,

490
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,940
- and that was your girlfriend.
- Time loops.

491
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:48,783
Gnarly.

492
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,078
Extremely gnarly.

493
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,412
So you're talking to me about it.

494
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:55,199
Yeah.

495
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,899
As opposed to Alice, Julia, or Kady.

496
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,759
Or, to state the obvious,

497
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,339
Margo.

498
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,425
I kind of blew it beyond
repair with Margo.

499
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:07,139
How is anything beyond repair

500
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,263
when you're stuck in a time loop?

501
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:11,399
Well,

502
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,109
she was awake with me
for a while and then

503
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:18,396
she got kicked out somehow,
and now I am utterly alone.

504
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:21,039
Well, if I'm learning anything

505
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,379
from these squishy pierogi tacos

506
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,439
is that not everything belongs together.

507
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,118
- How can we help?
- Help save the world?

508
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,589
Honestly, I don't know.

509
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,249
It might not be possible.

510
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:41,129
This might be it.

511
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:45,769
Me, alone, in this particular 12 hours.

512
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:48,769
- Eternally.
- Okay.

513
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:51,579
Sounds like a lot for you.

514
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:56,184
So, uh, anything I can do to help you?

515
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:58,079
I wish.

516
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,759
Because the longer this goes
on, the more certain I am

517
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,480
that the Monster is inside
of me and trying to get out.

518
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:05,194
Good metaphor.

519
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,445
I'm being literal.

520
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,459
Oh.

521
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,532
Shit.

522
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,599
It's worse every loop.

523
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,169
I hear its voice,

524
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:18,579
I see blood on the walls,

525
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,399
I... I see this door.

526
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,586
It wants out.

527
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,503
Have you tried letting it out?

528
00:24:25,504 --> 00:24:27,549
Why in God's name would I do that?

529
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:29,199
I... I... I'm just spitballing.

530
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,880
A lot of the time in these movies

531
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,879
the solution of the problem

532
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:37,409
is facing the thing
you're most afraid of.

533
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:40,239
What if I die?

534
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,231
What if you do?

535
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,900
Why?!

536
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,452
Anyway.

537
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,745
You're not upset you're about to die?

538
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:02,859
I don't love it.

539
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:05,212
But you'll figure out a way to fix this.

540
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:13,599
The world's greatest minds

541
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,799
are locked in a desperate
race to save humanity.

542
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,819
Everything I'm seeing says
the first chunk's gotta hit

543
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,933
around 10 p.m.

544
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,437
We have 12 hours.

545
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,315
What if we create a massive
portal in the atmosphere?

546
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:26,649
We'd need a specialist.

547
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,586
Charlton?

548
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,620
Well, fuck!

549
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,059
How the hell are you here?

550
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:41,979
I was trapped wandering
your Remembrances

551
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:44,890
when mercifully you decided
not to sleep for five days

552
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,499
and broke your brain.

553
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,929
That gave me an opening to contact you.

554
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:50,829
That voice?

555
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,199
That was you?

556
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,939
Yes, of course.

557
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,019
When all the scary
creatures were pulled out,

558
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,070
I held on tight as I could
in your Happy Place,

559
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:00,860
and, well... here we are.

560
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:04,419
This place was so vivid in your mind,

561
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:07,249
but there is nothing like
the real thing, is there?

562
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:11,119
The sights, the sounds, the...

563
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,380
smells!

564
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:16,092
Oh, I forgot about smells, Eliot.

565
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:17,929
They're overwhelmingly unpleasant.

566
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:20,499
Those messages? That was you, too?

567
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,724
"I'm still here"?

568
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:24,349
"Let me out"?

569
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,399
Yes.

570
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,079
I wanted you to know
that I was still here

571
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,469
and I wanted to be let out.

572
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:31,169
In red paint?

573
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:33,443
Right, like strawberries
and Santa Claus.

574
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:35,111
And blood, Charlton.

575
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:36,738
Well, perhaps it was a touch ominous.

576
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:38,323
As was the creepy whisper.

577
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:40,367
- I was trying to be polite.
- Well...

578
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:46,319
It is nice to have a
non-imaginary imaginary friend

579
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,581
for the end of the world, I guess.

580
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:48,666
Half-imaginary.

581
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,836
I was passenger in your unconscious.

582
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:56,169
Now, I'm still in your head.

583
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:58,239
But the conscious part?

584
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,309
I can't tell you how much
of an improvement this is.

585
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:03,060
Your Happy Place is nice

586
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:06,159
and I was able to see
everything you were doing here,

587
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,979
but...

588
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,979
well, there's no substitute
for being heard.

589
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:13,099
Especially since I often
disagree with your choices,

590
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,480
and I'd like to share my opinions.

591
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:16,499
Oh, that's peachy.

592
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,040
Well, let's start now.

593
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,867
Opinion on what to do next?

594
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,744
Oh, well, I'd think that's obvious.

595
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:26,829
Is it?

596
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,079
In case you didn't notice,

597
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,759
Margo was sort of driving
the bus on this whole thing

598
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,160
before I screwed up and lost her.

599
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:34,003
You didn't lose her, Eliot.

600
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:36,379
She's out of the loops, Charlton.

601
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,759
No, I simply mean I don't
think that's about you.

602
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,550
I think she got too close to the answer.

603
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,199
Perhaps that's why

604
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,309
she was thrown from your
shared loop experience.

605
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:51,604
That does have the ring of logic to it.

606
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:53,690
Margo mentioned a beach, did she not?

607
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:56,029
Fisher Beach.

608
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,359
Okay.

609
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,823
Let's go.

610
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:04,569
Why is there no one here?

611
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:08,746
I think it's a cancel-your-beach-trip
kind of day today.

612
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,619
Psst... keep your eyes peeled

613
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:13,410
for anyone or anything who
might not want us here.

614
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:20,339
Is that phone wire?

615
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:27,640
Are phones generally used underwater?

616
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:34,939
I think we got a lead.

617
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,879
Lifeguard station 17.

618
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,039
That's the same track Margo was on.

619
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,199
This didn't go well for her,

620
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,279
so perhaps we should discuss
before going in there, okay?

621
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,190
Ovary up, Charlton.

622
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:56,319
Uh...

623
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,628
I guess...

624
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,507
off and whales?

625
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:04,178
What is the purpose of this distraction?

626
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:06,637
With whom are we speaking?

627
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,681
We are the whales.

628
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:12,769
Like... all of them?

629
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:14,479
Of course.

630
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,023
Why do you speak through a TV?

631
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:18,389
Why do you?

632
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,901
What is the nature of your query?

633
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:22,659
Okay, I don't really know
how to explain this.

634
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,359
Um...

635
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,097
okay, so you probably don't know this,

636
00:30:26,098 --> 00:30:28,242
but we... we are in a time loop.

637
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,620
We are aware of the disturbance.

638
00:30:30,621 --> 00:30:32,509
Oh, huh.

639
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:35,599
Whales grok time loops.

640
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,759
So do you happen to remember

641
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,919
if a woman named Margo came to see you?

642
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:43,169
Uh, brilliant, about yea high,
maybe a little brusque.

643
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:45,040
A contemptuous creature.

644
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:47,762
We were compelled to wash
away her temporal immunity.

645
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:51,259
You took her Permanence off.

646
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,639
Why?

647
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,645
Her manner was appalling.

648
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:57,959
That...

649
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,369
does sound like Margo, okay.

650
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:03,320
I apologize for her bedside
manner, and I just...

651
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:07,339
I humbly and I respectfully
ask, do you...

652
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:10,576
do you have any insight into
this loop that we're in?

653
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,578
Our magic caused it.

654
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,748
You're... magicians?

655
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:20,670
Pay attention! We will explain once.

656
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:23,359
Our ancestors made a
pact with the Old Gods

657
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,760
and so we spend our lives

658
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:27,239
tracing sigils into the ocean floor.

659
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,680
This task is crucial.

660
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,049
Why?

661
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:37,299
To ensure the Kraken stays dormant.

662
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,299
Like the... the Kraken-kraken?

663
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,020
What's a Kraken-kraken?

664
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:43,759
Should the Kraken ever awaken

665
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,730
it would soon consume the world.

666
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,519
Okay, got it.

667
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,949
So, the loops. Why?

668
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,579
The moon colliding with Earth

669
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,359
obliterated our protective sigils

670
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,699
causing the Kraken to rise.

671
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,940
Kinda seems like a hat on a hat

672
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:02,628
when you've already got
a moon apocalypse.

673
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,339
A bit flippant for a creature

674
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,170
who caused said apocalypse.

675
00:32:07,176 --> 00:32:10,099
Fortunately, our ancestors
implemented a failsafe.

676
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,959
If the Kraken awakens,
it sends Earth back 12 hours

677
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,559
to allow another chance
to avert catastrophe.

678
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,219
Whereupon it'll all just keep happening

679
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:21,230
because the fucking moon is broken.

680
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:23,099
So it would seem.

681
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,719
Well... uh... well,
if you're... if you're magicians,

682
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,279
then maybe you can help fix the moon?

683
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,519
We cannot.

684
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,489
We must maintain our sigils.

685
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,129
Okay.

686
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:37,039
If you don't fix the moon,
the Kraken's just...

687
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,369
just gonna keep krakening.

688
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:40,164
This distraction has gone on too long.

689
00:32:40,165 --> 00:32:41,209
Wait... no, no, no.

690
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,619
We must attend to the sigils.

691
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:44,170
- Hold on.
- Do not contact us again.

692
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:45,171
No, no, no, no, no.

693
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:46,631
No!

694
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:49,439
Uh...

695
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,950
oh, shit.

696
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:59,399
Feeling the wrong kind
of boned right now.

697
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,209
Oh, okay.

698
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:02,648
Bye, I guess.

699
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:08,999
What am I supposed to do?

700
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,460
I can't fix the moon. That won't work.

701
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:14,199
You can't help, you're non-corporeal.

702
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,410
True.

703
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:21,279
But...

704
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,260
you're not alone.

705
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:29,840
So whales really are powerful magicians.

706
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,884
I knew they did weird
stuff on the ocean floor,

707
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:34,175
- I just didn't realize it was...
- Wait. Yes, Alice...

708
00:33:34,176 --> 00:33:35,899
tell me what else you know about whales.

709
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,479
Um...

710
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,599
their closest cousin is the hippo.

711
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,009
Um, their mating season is in the fall.

712
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:43,719
That is so sad for them.

713
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,469
What if they never get
to make love again?

714
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,479
Though I am one to talk.

715
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,899
I mean, it's been over a thousand years.

716
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,499
That's not exactly what I needed.

717
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,379
Well, you asked me what I knew.

718
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,299
Is there any info about the Kraken

719
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,699
that might point us in a direction?

720
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,499
Whoa-ho-ho! Okay.

721
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:00,899
Well, you have your
Lovecraftian god-Krakens.

722
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,649
Uh, and then there's the D&D Kraken

723
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:04,869
which is sort of six-of-one.

724
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:08,419
And then, of course,
there's "Clash of the Titans",

725
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,631
- both the original and the remake.
- Thank you.

726
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,508
With the very famous line...

727
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:13,760
Thank you, Josh.

728
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,819
Every time the Kraken awakens,

729
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,260
time jumps back 12 hours.

730
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,739
Which would be great if it took us back

731
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:20,970
to before the moon broke.

732
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:25,239
What if we get the time
loop spell to trigger

733
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,819
a couple hours early?

734
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,108
Why don't we just kill
all the damn whales?

735
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:31,439
Well, that's clearly
what you tried to do

736
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,820
when they took away your Permanence.

737
00:34:32,821 --> 00:34:34,899
But she's right.

738
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:38,179
Maybe we need to let out
the thing that scares us.

739
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,660
Maybe we need to, uh, to...

740
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:41,871
Release the Kraken!

741
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:44,289
Exactly, yeah.

742
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,339
But earlier.

743
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:49,670
Early... early enough to
a time before the heist.

744
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:51,547
Shit, we're almost out of time.

745
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,290
Look, if the whales have the power

746
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:01,349
to take away your Permanence,
this could be your last shot.

747
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:04,560
No presh, but you're our only hope.

748
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:09,482
I will do my very best.

749
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,244
Surely, you jest.

750
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:24,379
I know, I know.

751
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,979
It goes against everything
you've ever believed in,

752
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,292
and I fully respect that,

753
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:30,169
but the only way to fix this

754
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:32,547
is to release the Kraken right now.

755
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,879
Well, I don't think they liked that.

756
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,959
What? No.

757
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,553
Damn it!

758
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,429
Eliot?

759
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,516
Please be careful.

760
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:44,969
Uh, you don't know what they will do.

761
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:46,420
Hey!

762
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:49,314
You know I'm right!

763
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:53,139
I know you're listening.

764
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,979
You know, I have it on good authority

765
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:59,049
that mating season is in the fall.

766
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,779
Do you never wanna fuck again?

767
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,911
- Eliot, that was too personal.
- Uh...

768
00:36:02,912 --> 00:36:05,621
okay, uh, sorry.

769
00:36:05,622 --> 00:36:08,749
Look, I get it.

770
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,751
Look, I get it... your
ancestors made a deal,

771
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:13,129
but special circumstances, okay?

772
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:15,599
Just let it out for 30 seconds.

773
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,209
I will fix this and then, you know, uh,

774
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:22,009
the Kraken will be back in
its safe little sea bed

775
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:25,683
and, uh, you can maintain
your sigils for all of eternity.

776
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,184
You gotta trust me.

777
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:30,271
Just release the goddamn Kraken.

778
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:33,692
Please, please, please, please, please.

779
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:37,569
Look.

780
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,844
Hi there!

781
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:04,449
Uh...

782
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:06,307
are you the Kraken?

783
00:37:06,308 --> 00:37:08,049
No.

784
00:37:15,317 --> 00:37:16,859
Josh, Margo, Penny.

785
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,759
You guys go inside,
loop all the cameras,

786
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,150
open the side door for Natasha.

787
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:22,590
I'll be outside waiting
with Eliot and Alice.

788
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,000
Holy shit.

789
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,040
Holy shit.

790
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,246
Holy shit.

791
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,582
This is before the moon broke.

792
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,876
It worked.

793
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,460
- Okay, break.
- Sorry.

794
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:40,449
Um, could you just, uh... could you...

795
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:42,149
You're freaking out, aren't you?

796
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,919
- No.
- Look, you can pull the ripcord now.

797
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,679
- Get out, we'll handle this.
- Margo.

798
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:50,089
Credenza.

799
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:52,604
Don't ask questions,
just do what you say?

800
00:37:52,605 --> 00:37:53,929
Mm-hmm.

801
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:56,398
Fine.

802
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,199
Okay.

803
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,510
Slight change of plans.

804
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,679
We are so close to saving everyone.

805
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,439
You can't take that away from us now.

806
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,959
Look, whatever it is you're after

807
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,780
what's the point if
there's no world left?

808
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:13,369
There'll still be a world,
just not as many people.

809
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:14,829
Have you met people?

810
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:18,170
I've met people, many people.

811
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:19,923
How many people have you met?

812
00:38:19,924 --> 00:38:22,809
Because I bet I've met more people.

813
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:25,209
What the fuck is wrong with you?

814
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:27,012
Hi.

815
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,515
What the hell did...

816
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,180
Hell, yes.

817
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:37,273
What the... how did you...

818
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:38,649
Julia, now.

819
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,419
Hey!

820
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,779
Hot pizza!

821
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:08,619
That's one pizza we
definitely can enjoy.

822
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:11,319
All right. Oh, nice pour right there.

823
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:14,879
Yes, cheers, cheers, yes.

824
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,749
Bam!

825
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:18,314
- All right, Emeril.
- Fresco pizza!

826
00:39:18,315 --> 00:39:20,729
Yes, cheers.

827
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:21,920
Whoo!

828
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:32,409
You don't want a drink?

829
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:37,749
Actually, I desperately do not.

830
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,519
That's concerning. Those time loops

831
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,210
must've really did a number on you.

832
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,139
So...

833
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,636
You're right, I have
been pushing you away.

834
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,347
Yeah, no shit.

835
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,750
It's just...

836
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,774
I do remember the Monster.

837
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:06,130
It was bad and bloody and, um...

838
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:10,049
Those memories are, like, right here.

839
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:13,259
And, um...

840
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,939
you know, maybe I really
do need that drink.

841
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,790
I don't get why you feel like
you have to go it alone.

842
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:22,921
I don't either.

843
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,989
My logical brain knows without a doubt

844
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:27,999
that I'm better with you.

845
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,669
Yes, and same.

846
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,959
Tell your coping
mechanisms to back off...

847
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,981
Or I'll punch 'em in the dick.

848
00:40:40,982 --> 00:40:44,799
During the loops, we were in it together

849
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,349
and then you were gone, and...

850
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:49,139
shocking revelation...

851
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,949
I am utterly miserable
when you're not around.

852
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:53,489
Yeah, I know.

853
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:55,161
I don't know if that's fair to you.

854
00:40:55,162 --> 00:40:56,788
What are you talking about?

855
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,179
The other thing I learned

856
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:02,769
being in the loops with
you for so long...

857
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:05,713
you're not exactly who you used to be.

858
00:41:05,714 --> 00:41:06,809
You've...

859
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:08,215
Please don't say aged.

860
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:12,209
You've evolved, Margo Hanson.

861
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:14,019
You've become more of your true self.

862
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,930
You've earned it.

863
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:21,289
And I don't want to ask
you to take a step back

864
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:24,019
just so I can try and catch up.

865
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,107
Oh.

866
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:27,419
I was a mess you had
to untangle in there

867
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:32,299
just so you could soldier on,
and... once you did,

868
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,319
you figured out how to fix all of this.

869
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,759
And then you picked up the baton

870
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,037
and actually did the thing.

871
00:41:37,038 --> 00:41:39,809
- I got lucky.
- No.

872
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:47,349
It's 'cause you understand
me better than anyone.

873
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:48,673
Mm-hmm.

874
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,900
So quit acting like you're the
screw-up and get on my level, El.

875
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:59,329
You did it.

876
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:01,389
You did when the world was on the line,

877
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:03,029
now do it for yourself.

878
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:14,399
I don't know if I want
to get on your level

879
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,069
knowing that you jacked off Todd.

880
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:18,745
- I did not.
- Yeah, you did.

881
00:42:19,788 --> 00:42:21,831
I did not.

882
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:28,462
The hell?

883
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:29,859
Coming.

884
00:42:31,341 --> 00:42:33,229
Oh, thank God!

885
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:36,359
I've tried every other magical
Penthouse in the city and...

886
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:39,279
Todd. Wh... uh, what...

887
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,549
Why are you here?

888
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:41,679
I need your help.

889
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,279
Something just happened that
feels way above my pay grade,

890
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,679
and you were the first
person I thought of

891
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,769
who could help me handle it.

892
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:49,441
Okay, it's a weird one.
Just hear me out, okay?

893
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:53,599
So this pig dude who kind of looks like

894
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,419
that one guy Paul Giamatti played

895
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:56,849
in that one show with all the wigs

896
00:42:56,850 --> 00:42:58,575
told me I'm supposed to do a quest.

897
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,189
Seriously?

898
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:02,162
That asshole went to you?

899
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:04,039
Wow. Ha.

900
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,667
Yeah, he's extremely
committed to finding a dude.

901
00:43:06,668 --> 00:43:09,753
Yeah, it's fine, Todd. We fixed it.

902
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:12,969
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yes, I'm sure.

903
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:15,169
The Harmonic Convergence
isn't happening anymore.

904
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:16,677
The who now?

905
00:43:16,678 --> 00:43:18,303
The end of the world?

906
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:19,839
Uh, no.

907
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:23,319
He did say the end of
something but not that.

908
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,039
He was talking about Fillory.

909
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,149
Remind me, is Fillory real?

910
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:30,817
The end of Fillory?

911
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,679
So...

912
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,970
so we saved the wrong world?

913
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:42,040
So we're not done.

914
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,979
Of course.
