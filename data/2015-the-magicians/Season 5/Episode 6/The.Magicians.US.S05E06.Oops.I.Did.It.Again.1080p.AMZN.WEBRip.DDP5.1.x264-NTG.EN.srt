1
00:00:06,397 --> 00:00:08,704
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:08,747 --> 00:00:09,986
You're not right, El,
and we both know why.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,161
You said you don't remember
what happened

4
00:00:11,185 --> 00:00:12,142
when you were possessed,
but Julia does.

5
00:00:12,186 --> 00:00:13,535
And I don't.

6
00:00:13,578 --> 00:00:16,190
I don't know why
you're accusing me of lying.

7
00:00:16,233 --> 00:00:19,280
Eliot, let me out.

8
00:00:19,323 --> 00:00:20,585
We're looking for Stoppard.

9
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:22,326
Mom? Mom, what's wrong?

10
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,459
- Moms die every day.
- Circle of life.

11
00:00:24,502 --> 00:00:26,350
We know you're trying
to look out for your mom.

12
00:00:26,374 --> 00:00:27,679
You're saying you'll leave?

13
00:00:27,723 --> 00:00:29,420
- Sorry, man.
- I'm not going anywhere.

14
00:00:29,464 --> 00:00:31,292
The Harmonic Convergence.

15
00:00:31,335 --> 00:00:33,033
AKA the end of the world.

16
00:00:33,076 --> 00:00:34,271
The convergence will only occur

17
00:00:34,295 --> 00:00:36,253
during this perfect alignment.

18
00:00:36,297 --> 00:00:38,734
If we move the moon
out of position...

19
00:00:38,777 --> 00:00:42,042
No Convergence,
no Circumstance, no apocalypse.

20
00:00:42,085 --> 00:00:44,348
If you have moon brain,
then you will see her aura.

21
00:00:44,392 --> 00:00:46,437
If it is green,
she is listening.

22
00:00:46,481 --> 00:00:50,180
Only then may you ask her
to move.

23
00:00:50,224 --> 00:00:51,399
You will need a piece of her.

24
00:00:51,442 --> 00:00:52,704
Like a moon rock?

25
00:00:52,748 --> 00:00:54,184
In here, boss.

26
00:00:54,228 --> 00:00:56,360
Ladies.

27
00:00:56,404 --> 00:00:57,448
You're moving the moon?

28
00:00:57,492 --> 00:00:58,492
Yeah.

29
00:01:02,323 --> 00:01:04,542
Uh, guys?

30
00:01:04,586 --> 00:01:06,631
I think we broke the moon.

31
00:01:07,589 --> 00:01:09,591
NASA estimates just hours

32
00:01:09,634 --> 00:01:12,202
before the first pieces
reach our atmosphere.

33
00:01:12,246 --> 00:01:15,553
In a tweet, the president
stressed the need for calm,

34
00:01:15,597 --> 00:01:19,122
saying, "We will fix
the moon decisively."

35
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:22,821
The American people have
absolutely nothing to fear."

36
00:01:29,611 --> 00:01:33,615
I know we are dealing
with the lunapocalypse problem,

37
00:01:33,658 --> 00:01:36,357
but I have to insist
that we all take a minute

38
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,534
for a little
self-care/pizza, okay?

39
00:01:39,577 --> 00:01:40,622
Okay.

40
00:01:40,665 --> 00:01:42,363
Cautioning everyone that

41
00:01:42,406 --> 00:01:44,321
though the world appears
to be coming to an end,

42
00:01:44,365 --> 00:01:46,541
everyone's behavior
will still be counted

43
00:01:46,584 --> 00:01:48,325
when the time comes
for judgment.

44
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:51,633
Feeling the wrong kind
of boned right now.

45
00:01:51,676 --> 00:01:53,504
At least
the Harmonic Convergence

46
00:01:53,548 --> 00:01:55,115
isn't happening anymore.

47
00:01:57,682 --> 00:02:00,598
I just have this bad feeling.

48
00:02:00,642 --> 00:02:02,209
Hey.

49
00:02:02,252 --> 00:02:05,125
We'll figure out
how to stop this.

50
00:02:05,168 --> 00:02:07,692
I mean, on the off-chance
the president doesn't.

51
00:02:07,736 --> 00:02:09,520
Let's review.

52
00:02:09,564 --> 00:02:12,480
Emergency code words
if this all goes shit-shaped?

53
00:02:12,523 --> 00:02:14,482
Um...

54
00:02:14,525 --> 00:02:15,700
Really?

55
00:02:15,744 --> 00:02:16,875
Kidding. Okay.

56
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,182
As follows.

57
00:02:19,226 --> 00:02:21,402
"Credenza," no questions asked.

58
00:02:21,445 --> 00:02:22,925
"Inglenook," tie those fools up,

59
00:02:22,968 --> 00:02:24,709
toss 'em through
the Fillory portal.

60
00:02:24,753 --> 00:02:26,494
"Chifforobe," flee to Canada.

61
00:02:26,537 --> 00:02:28,409
"Armoire," shield up, stat.

62
00:02:28,452 --> 00:02:29,671
"Kimono"...

63
00:02:29,714 --> 00:02:31,281
both: All hell has broken loose.

64
00:02:31,325 --> 00:02:34,241
Time and hope
are quickly running out.

65
00:02:34,284 --> 00:02:36,852
Everything I'm seeing says
the first chunk's gonna hit

66
00:02:36,895 --> 00:02:39,202
around 10:00 p.m.

67
00:02:39,246 --> 00:02:40,682
We have 12 hours.

68
00:02:44,642 --> 00:02:45,643
Uh, look.

69
00:02:45,687 --> 00:02:46,881
What if we created
a massive portal

70
00:02:46,905 --> 00:02:48,298
in the atmosphere?

71
00:02:48,342 --> 00:02:49,406
No, we need a specialist,

72
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,346
and the meta-math is just...
It's too...

73
00:02:52,389 --> 00:02:54,217
This is really bad, Julia.

74
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:55,827
Nuh-uh.

75
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:58,221
Don't you dare give up.

76
00:02:59,353 --> 00:03:00,832
This math
is so damn frustrating.

77
00:03:00,876 --> 00:03:02,269
Yeah, but you'll get it.

78
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:06,229
Jesus.

79
00:03:06,273 --> 00:03:07,535
What happened to your shoe?

80
00:03:07,578 --> 00:03:08,753
Have you been out there?

81
00:03:08,797 --> 00:03:11,321
It is the literal end
of the actual world.

82
00:03:11,365 --> 00:03:12,845
- No, it's not.
- We're gonna stop it.

83
00:03:12,888 --> 00:03:15,238
Yeah, tell that to the
rioters and the prayer circles

84
00:03:15,282 --> 00:03:17,240
and people fucking
in the streets.

85
00:03:17,284 --> 00:03:18,807
I can't believe
this is happening.

86
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,852
I'm just numb.

87
00:03:20,896 --> 00:03:23,551
Try the truffled prosciutto,
it's incredible.

88
00:03:25,422 --> 00:03:27,468
I did have one idea

89
00:03:27,511 --> 00:03:29,687
after my very bad idea
to take the subway.

90
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:32,690
Okay, do you know Richard's
Reverse Entropy spell?

91
00:03:32,734 --> 00:03:33,841
We already talked about it.

92
00:03:33,865 --> 00:03:35,016
Unfortunately, it's just
way too small.

93
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,521
True, but I reworked it.

94
00:03:37,565 --> 00:03:40,350
And check my math.

95
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,790
This is fantastic, but...

96
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:48,445
I don't think we have
enough cooperative power.

97
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:50,708
Chances are high for a surge
in the next 12 hours.

98
00:03:50,752 --> 00:03:51,753
We could use it.

99
00:03:51,796 --> 00:03:53,363
And we have enough hedges

100
00:03:53,407 --> 00:03:57,889
around the world on standby
to do it with us, so...

101
00:03:57,933 --> 00:03:59,848
That might not be enough.

102
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:00,979
We make it enough.

103
00:04:01,023 --> 00:04:02,764
Today we are saving the world,

104
00:04:02,807 --> 00:04:05,375
and this time it's gonna stick.

105
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:06,463
Damn right, we are.

106
00:04:06,507 --> 00:04:08,291
Okay.

107
00:04:10,032 --> 00:04:11,903
But just in case...

108
00:04:12,991 --> 00:04:16,430
Anything I need to say to you?

109
00:04:16,473 --> 00:04:17,561
Jules, we're good.

110
00:04:21,348 --> 00:04:23,350
Scientists around the world

111
00:04:23,393 --> 00:04:25,003
have been sending out
their predictions

112
00:04:25,047 --> 00:04:26,918
for what we should expect
in the coming hours.

113
00:04:26,962 --> 00:04:29,573
Though the tides remain
mysteriously intact,

114
00:04:29,617 --> 00:04:31,880
expect volcanic activity,

115
00:04:31,923 --> 00:04:34,926
tectonic shifts,
disrupted weather patterns,

116
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:37,407
and strange behavior
from animal life.

117
00:04:40,932 --> 00:04:43,500
And to Sharon Cappanelli
from ninth grade:

118
00:04:43,544 --> 00:04:44,936
I lied.

119
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,330
It was my tampon,
and that was your girlfriend.

120
00:04:47,374 --> 00:04:48,679
I'm not sorry.

121
00:04:48,723 --> 00:04:50,420
Thanks for spreading
the word, Pete.

122
00:04:50,464 --> 00:04:51,508
Stand by.

123
00:04:52,988 --> 00:04:54,381
Everyone's set.

124
00:04:54,424 --> 00:04:55,860
We're just waiting
for the surge.

125
00:05:09,004 --> 00:05:10,788
You guys feel that?

126
00:05:10,832 --> 00:05:11,876
It's the surge.

127
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,487
It's cresting. We should...

128
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,315
Go. Pete, now!

129
00:05:34,682 --> 00:05:35,987
Did it work?

130
00:05:43,865 --> 00:05:45,780
It didn't work.

131
00:05:45,823 --> 00:05:48,348
We failed.

132
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:10,413
Feeling the wrong kind
of boned...

133
00:06:10,457 --> 00:06:12,023
right now.

134
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:14,548
At least the Harmonic
Convergence

135
00:06:14,591 --> 00:06:16,376
isn't happening anymore.

136
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:17,942
Although the world's
greatest minds

137
00:06:17,986 --> 00:06:19,857
are locked in a desperate race
to save humanity

138
00:06:19,901 --> 00:06:22,033
from this sudden
lunar cataclysm,

139
00:06:22,077 --> 00:06:24,732
time and hope
are quickly running out.

140
00:06:24,775 --> 00:06:26,536
Everything I'm seeing
says the first chunk's

141
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,865
gonna hit around 10:00 p.m.

142
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:29,693
We have 12 hours.

143
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,437
Uh, look, what if we created

144
00:06:34,481 --> 00:06:35,917
a massive portal
in the atmosphere?

145
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,441
We need a specialist,
and the meta-math is just...

146
00:06:38,485 --> 00:06:40,791
It's too... this
is really bad, Julia.

147
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:42,489
Am I crazy, or...

148
00:06:42,532 --> 00:06:44,118
This already happened, right?

149
00:06:44,142 --> 00:06:45,796
This math is so damn
frustrating.

150
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,058
This did.

151
00:06:47,102 --> 00:06:48,886
This did already happen.

152
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:50,018
Ow!

153
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:51,541
Not a dream.

154
00:06:51,585 --> 00:06:53,891
Hey, am I on something,

155
00:06:53,935 --> 00:06:55,893
or did we try this plan
yesterday?

156
00:06:55,937 --> 00:06:57,068
We're...

157
00:06:57,112 --> 00:06:58,983
At Westbrook's estate?

158
00:07:01,943 --> 00:07:02,943
Jesus.

159
00:07:04,075 --> 00:07:05,512
What happened to your shoe?

160
00:07:05,555 --> 00:07:07,470
Have you been out there?

161
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:09,690
It's the literal end
of the actual world.

162
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:11,648
- No, it's not.
- We're stopping it.

163
00:07:11,692 --> 00:07:13,476
Tell that to the rioters,
prayer circles,

164
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,826
and people fucking
in the streets.

165
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,612
Both: We're in a time loop.

166
00:07:20,657 --> 00:07:22,485
Excuse us
while we briefly sidebar.

167
00:07:24,792 --> 00:07:26,837
Why exactly is this happening?

168
00:07:26,881 --> 00:07:28,839
"Why is anything?" he asked,

169
00:07:28,883 --> 00:07:30,600
still freaked, 'cause
the last thing he remembers

170
00:07:30,624 --> 00:07:32,190
is all of Earth ending.

171
00:07:32,234 --> 00:07:33,191
It felt so inevitable.

172
00:07:33,235 --> 00:07:34,192
I know.

173
00:07:34,236 --> 00:07:36,499
But why us, now?

174
00:07:36,543 --> 00:07:37,631
Time loop?

175
00:07:37,674 --> 00:07:39,937
Of course we're the chosen ones.

176
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:41,069
We're us.

177
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:43,941
Okay, everybody.

178
00:07:43,985 --> 00:07:45,508
What is going on with you two?

179
00:07:45,552 --> 00:07:47,597
Quick recap,
Kady's plan won't work.

180
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:50,905
We tried it, and the moon
still crashed into the Earth.

181
00:07:50,948 --> 00:07:53,821
- Uh, okay.
- What do you mean, "tried it"?

182
00:07:53,864 --> 00:07:55,953
We suspect we're in a time loop.

183
00:07:55,997 --> 00:07:57,172
How?

184
00:07:57,215 --> 00:07:59,000
Obviously...

185
00:07:59,043 --> 00:08:02,786
the moon's a wily cunt
who doesn't wanna die.

186
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:04,092
Okay.

187
00:08:04,135 --> 00:08:06,224
All right,
so no reverse entropy.

188
00:08:06,268 --> 00:08:07,922
What do you guys suggest?

189
00:08:07,965 --> 00:08:10,533
We cast Vinnola's
Oxygen Saver on Penny 23,

190
00:08:10,577 --> 00:08:11,882
then he travels to the moon.

191
00:08:11,926 --> 00:08:13,275
It's easier
to do a portal there.

192
00:08:13,318 --> 00:08:14,494
Look, GPS is kinda broken.

193
00:08:14,537 --> 00:08:15,712
I might end up in a wall.

194
00:08:15,756 --> 00:08:18,802
- It's the apocalypse.
- Gonna need you to try.

195
00:08:22,197 --> 00:08:23,764
Fuck all of you.

196
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,807
Fine.

197
00:08:29,857 --> 00:08:31,641
You got this, man.

198
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:40,171
Oh... oh, no! No!

199
00:08:50,007 --> 00:08:50,965
Okay, forget the moon.

200
00:08:51,008 --> 00:08:52,923
Let's move the Earth.

201
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:54,664
Kady, get your hedge bitches
on the horn.

202
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:56,100
We got cooperating to do.

203
00:08:56,144 --> 00:08:57,537
I'm on it.

204
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:01,541
Okay.

205
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:02,605
I found a spell that can hold

206
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:04,029
the pieces in suspension,
we just...

207
00:09:04,065 --> 00:09:06,807
Right, good to assume
we can all do sphincter magic?

208
00:09:14,902 --> 00:09:16,860
Could we make this very big?

209
00:09:18,862 --> 00:09:20,690
Mother-shit!

210
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:22,083
You... you okay?

211
00:09:22,126 --> 00:09:24,868
No, Julia. I'm not okay.

212
00:09:24,912 --> 00:09:25,912
Bless you.

213
00:09:27,044 --> 00:09:28,959
Whoa.

214
00:09:29,003 --> 00:09:30,178
Allow me to explain.

215
00:09:30,221 --> 00:09:32,702
So here we are, eight loops in.

216
00:09:32,746 --> 00:09:34,312
Ten.

217
00:09:34,356 --> 00:09:36,029
If these loops sent us back
even a little earlier,

218
00:09:36,053 --> 00:09:37,881
we could stop Marina
from bad-touching

219
00:09:37,925 --> 00:09:39,970
this whole situation,
but we can't.

220
00:09:40,014 --> 00:09:41,363
Okay, so we need time magic.

221
00:09:41,406 --> 00:09:43,147
I know a horomancer
who builds machines.

222
00:09:43,191 --> 00:09:44,148
Maybe he has something.

223
00:09:44,192 --> 00:09:45,715
Fantastic, vámanos.

224
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,151
One problem...

225
00:09:47,195 --> 00:09:49,589
I kind of let his mom die
last time I saw him.

226
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:50,633
Oh.

227
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:53,375
Oh, come on.

228
00:09:53,418 --> 00:09:55,246
Like you guys are all saints?

229
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,684
You're in a time loop?

230
00:09:57,727 --> 00:09:58,946
Well, why you two?

231
00:09:58,989 --> 00:09:59,947
'Cause we're the best-looking.

232
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:01,035
Here.

233
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:03,124
This is Penny's address.

234
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:04,188
Margo, what are you doing?

235
00:10:04,212 --> 00:10:05,822
Favorite coffee shop,

236
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:07,955
hipster club where we suspect
he DJ's on the weekend,

237
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:10,218
and it's your lucky day...
His Travelling's borked,

238
00:10:10,261 --> 00:10:12,046
so he's a sitting duck
in a scarf.

239
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:14,265
Margo, we can't just kill Penny.

240
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:16,920
We don't; He dies anyway,
along with everyone.

241
00:10:16,964 --> 00:10:19,140
This is basic
trolley problem shit.

242
00:10:19,183 --> 00:10:20,184
Ovary up.

243
00:10:20,228 --> 00:10:21,272
Okay.

244
00:10:21,316 --> 00:10:22,752
If I wanted revenge on Penny,

245
00:10:22,796 --> 00:10:24,841
I would've gotten that
a long time ago.

246
00:10:28,715 --> 00:10:31,761
You've got particles
all over you.

247
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:32,999
Were you spritzed
with something?

248
00:10:33,023 --> 00:10:34,329
Spritzed, like with what?

249
00:10:34,372 --> 00:10:35,939
Something that nebulized

250
00:10:35,983 --> 00:10:37,767
a cloud of temporal permanence
around you?

251
00:10:37,811 --> 00:10:39,290
Mm.

252
00:10:39,334 --> 00:10:40,988
"Permanence."

253
00:10:42,337 --> 00:10:43,817
For men and women.

254
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,949
Yeah, I may have
accidentally stolen

255
00:10:45,993 --> 00:10:49,257
a weird perfume bottle
from a time witch in Fillory.

256
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,128
Okay, whatever you really did,

257
00:10:51,172 --> 00:10:52,652
it's created a field
around you both

258
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:54,741
that would explain why you're...

259
00:10:54,784 --> 00:10:55,742
in a time loop.

260
00:10:55,785 --> 00:10:56,873
Ah.

261
00:10:56,917 --> 00:10:58,317
And here we thought
we were special.

262
00:10:59,354 --> 00:11:02,139
- What are you doing?
- Helping.

263
00:11:02,183 --> 00:11:03,682
You said it's the end
of the world, right?

264
00:11:03,706 --> 00:11:04,794
That is right.

265
00:11:04,838 --> 00:11:06,317
I think I can hop you guys back

266
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:08,798
a full 48 hours so you can
prevent this.

267
00:11:08,842 --> 00:11:10,452
Oh, really? Just like that?

268
00:11:10,495 --> 00:11:13,063
Well, it's really
goddamn complicated,

269
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:14,674
but I'm a genius.

270
00:11:16,066 --> 00:11:17,459
- Oh.
- Oh.

271
00:11:17,502 --> 00:11:19,809
Here we go.

272
00:11:22,856 --> 00:11:24,684
Are we time traveling right now?

273
00:11:26,903 --> 00:11:27,991
The hell?

274
00:11:28,035 --> 00:11:29,993
What's wrong?

275
00:11:30,037 --> 00:11:32,822
Nothing's working... at all.

276
00:11:32,866 --> 00:11:34,104
Are you saying
your shit's broken?

277
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:35,085
I hope so.

278
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:36,391
The alternative is...

279
00:11:36,434 --> 00:11:38,698
all time magic's
in some kind of lockdown.

280
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:39,829
What could even do that?

281
00:11:39,873 --> 00:11:42,049
Something powerful...

282
00:11:42,092 --> 00:11:43,050
and ancient.

283
00:11:43,093 --> 00:11:45,182
You mean like the moon?

284
00:11:45,226 --> 00:11:48,708
Maybe if I just fix this
and bypass the oscillation...

285
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:50,144
Hey, no rush, but in 30 seconds,

286
00:11:50,187 --> 00:11:52,102
we're all gonna die.

287
00:11:52,146 --> 00:11:53,190
This'll get you there.

288
00:11:53,234 --> 00:11:54,757
Not in one piece, but...

289
00:11:54,801 --> 00:11:56,150
Wait, what?

290
00:11:58,108 --> 00:11:59,893
Shit. I'm sorry.

291
00:11:59,936 --> 00:12:00,936
Oh, well.

292
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:06,832
I cannot believe
we didn't consider

293
00:12:06,856 --> 00:12:08,249
going to Jane Chatwin first.

294
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:10,294
Well, she is a person
that may be upset with us.

295
00:12:10,338 --> 00:12:11,948
Yes.

296
00:12:14,037 --> 00:12:15,647
- No.
- Huh.

297
00:12:15,691 --> 00:12:17,084
Time magic's locked down,

298
00:12:17,127 --> 00:12:19,913
and the portal
to Fillory's blocked.

299
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:22,829
This smacks of
a not-so-random coincidence.

300
00:12:25,266 --> 00:12:26,789
Okay.

301
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:29,009
We can still get there.
Penny can't do shit.

302
00:12:29,052 --> 00:12:30,726
What about that other
Traveller dickbucket,

303
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,075
- Gavin what's-his-name?
- Everything I'm seeing

304
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:33,903
says the first chunk's
gonna hit around 10:00 p.m...

305
00:12:33,927 --> 00:12:36,712
We know! 12 hours.

306
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,193
- We're seeing this wrong.
- We're missing something.

307
00:12:39,236 --> 00:12:41,761
Uh, maybe we need
to take a step back.

308
00:12:41,804 --> 00:12:43,632
Start thinking outside the box.

309
00:12:43,675 --> 00:12:44,720
What do you suggest?

310
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,548
Remember Professor Soto?

311
00:12:46,591 --> 00:12:48,811
- Oh, the one with the pants?
- Yeah.

312
00:12:48,855 --> 00:12:50,160
He had that ridiculous test

313
00:12:50,204 --> 00:12:51,683
everyone thought was impossible.

314
00:12:51,727 --> 00:12:52,965
That we solved because we rule.

315
00:12:52,989 --> 00:12:54,904
- Solved how?
- You want me to remember

316
00:12:54,948 --> 00:12:56,732
a solution I came up with
at a rager

317
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,865
doing upside-down shots
in a fur bikini?

318
00:12:58,908 --> 00:13:00,692
You say rager,

319
00:13:00,736 --> 00:13:03,043
I say problem-solving session.

320
00:13:03,086 --> 00:13:06,220
We put our
minds on something different

321
00:13:06,263 --> 00:13:08,875
and we catch the solution out
of the corner of our eye.

322
00:13:08,918 --> 00:13:10,050
So is this actually a plan

323
00:13:10,093 --> 00:13:11,244
or do you just wanna
blow off steam?

324
00:13:11,268 --> 00:13:13,053
Two birds, Bambi.

325
00:13:13,096 --> 00:13:16,056
Besides, we're stuck in a game
that keeps hitting reset.

326
00:13:16,099 --> 00:13:19,233
Infinite time,
zero consequences.

327
00:13:19,276 --> 00:13:21,017
Just you and me saving the world

328
00:13:21,061 --> 00:13:22,627
through unbridled hedonism.

329
00:13:22,671 --> 00:13:26,022
Mm, fun. Let's do it.

330
00:13:29,112 --> 00:13:30,635
Eliot.

331
00:13:32,115 --> 00:13:33,203
Hey.

332
00:13:33,247 --> 00:13:34,770
Uh, hey.

333
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,095
Did someone just knock
on the door?

334
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:37,773
No. We going?

335
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:40,820
Yeah.

336
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,086
Okay, miscreants.

337
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:48,610
It's Armageddon.
So die as you lived...

338
00:13:48,653 --> 00:13:49,916
Boring.

339
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:51,328
Or join us in an
end-of-the-world soiree

340
00:13:51,352 --> 00:13:52,919
and die legends.

341
00:13:52,962 --> 00:13:53,920
Your choice.

342
00:13:53,963 --> 00:13:56,009
You heard the man.

343
00:13:57,967 --> 00:13:59,316
Come on!

344
00:14:01,362 --> 00:14:02,842
It's a tie!

345
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:04,321
Anything?

346
00:14:04,365 --> 00:14:06,106
Not yet!

347
00:14:08,717 --> 00:14:09,717
Oh!

348
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:26,126
Mmm.

349
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:27,169
Eliot!

350
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,307
- El, El.
- You look like you saw a ghost.

351
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,787
Hey, ask it
how we stop the moon.

352
00:14:35,831 --> 00:14:37,287
- Actually, I think I might...
- Wait!

353
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,922
Oh, my God,
I think I got something.

354
00:14:39,966 --> 00:14:41,837
An idea.

355
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:42,881
Hit me.

356
00:14:44,405 --> 00:14:46,320
Cock and balls, I forgot.

357
00:15:00,377 --> 00:15:03,032
This isn't working.

358
00:15:03,076 --> 00:15:04,947
No offense, Rajit.

359
00:15:04,991 --> 00:15:05,991
It's Todd.

360
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:07,994
No.

361
00:15:08,037 --> 00:15:09,386
Come back when you're Rajit.

362
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,954
Okay.

363
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:13,347
You know, I've been thinking...

364
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:15,270
Clearly we need something
a little bit stronger.

365
00:15:15,305 --> 00:15:16,872
No, we need an idea.

366
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,134
You know what?

367
00:15:18,178 --> 00:15:20,484
I'm gonna go hydrate
and, I don't know...

368
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:23,313
stare at moon chunks hurtling
straight for Earth.

369
00:15:23,357 --> 00:15:25,098
Can't be worse than discovering

370
00:15:25,141 --> 00:15:27,752
I just jacked Todd off
for three time loops in a row.

371
00:15:31,321 --> 00:15:34,107
Eliot.

372
00:15:35,325 --> 00:15:36,892
No...

373
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:40,026
It's never happening.

374
00:15:40,069 --> 00:15:42,985
Leave me alone.

375
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:13,233
I can walk away
from you all fucking day!

376
00:16:15,235 --> 00:16:17,759
Pardon me, Brenda.
I'm gonna get this.

377
00:16:28,378 --> 00:16:29,945
I got a lead.

378
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,034
I've been talking
to this weird oceanographer guy

379
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:33,557
who no joke has a dolphin harem,

380
00:16:33,601 --> 00:16:37,039
but he also knows
some real shit about...

381
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,867
Hey, what's up with you?

382
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,042
What's up?

383
00:16:40,086 --> 00:16:42,044
Is...

384
00:16:42,088 --> 00:16:46,048
my brain is a snake
eating its tail,

385
00:16:46,092 --> 00:16:48,572
and the tail is another snake
eating its tail.

386
00:16:48,616 --> 00:16:50,922
Jesus. Okay, you stay here.

387
00:16:50,966 --> 00:16:53,403
I'll report back
with some research.

388
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:07,939
I figured it out, El.

389
00:17:07,983 --> 00:17:10,986
From talking
to that dolphin fucker.

390
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,510
Everything he said checked out.

391
00:17:13,554 --> 00:17:16,905
We need to go to Fisher Beach.
It's kind of out of the way.

392
00:17:16,948 --> 00:17:19,299
Lifeguard station 17.

393
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:22,147
Everything I'm seeing says
the first chunk's

394
00:17:22,171 --> 00:17:23,912
gonna hit around 10:00 p.m...
Eliot.

395
00:17:23,955 --> 00:17:26,306
- We have 12 hours.
- Hey.

396
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:28,525
I got the answer.
You can take a breather.

397
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:30,614
Not right now, Margo.

398
00:17:30,658 --> 00:17:32,616
Okay, "Leaving Las Vegas."

399
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,227
I was happy to give you space

400
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,359
to tell your Monster secrets
in your own time,

401
00:17:36,403 --> 00:17:39,319
but we're stuck
in the Jean Paul Sarte bullshit

402
00:17:39,362 --> 00:17:40,972
and you're getting worse fast.

403
00:17:41,016 --> 00:17:42,950
I told you, this isn't
important right now, okay?

404
00:17:42,974 --> 00:17:44,193
Whatever it is,

405
00:17:44,237 --> 00:17:46,021
you remember
it's not your fault, okay?

406
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,023
This math is
so damn frustrating.

407
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,199
Can we just stop
the moon first, please?

408
00:17:50,243 --> 00:17:52,163
Not if your liver
falls out of your twat first.

409
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:53,463
Let's talk about it.

410
00:17:53,507 --> 00:17:54,595
No.

411
00:17:54,638 --> 00:17:57,989
- Seems like we have to.
- It's me.

412
00:17:58,033 --> 00:17:59,078
Don't be a coward.

413
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:00,601
Stop.

414
00:18:02,298 --> 00:18:05,997
It's still in me, okay?

415
00:18:11,046 --> 00:18:13,657
I am seeing what I am seeing.

416
00:18:13,701 --> 00:18:15,485
Some pieces of him
must've held on.

417
00:18:15,529 --> 00:18:17,357
The Monster is gone.

418
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,186
I exorcised it
and Q threw it into the Seam.

419
00:18:20,229 --> 00:18:22,275
The only thing here
is you medicating

420
00:18:22,318 --> 00:18:25,539
instead of facing
your memories and your feelings

421
00:18:25,582 --> 00:18:28,107
and I empathize, I do.

422
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:31,110
But I think you're forgetting
you can tell me anything.

423
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:35,157
I just told you,
and you didn't believe me.

424
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:36,898
I love you.

425
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:38,595
Even when you're nuts.

426
00:18:38,639 --> 00:18:40,641
But our window's 12 hours
to stop the moon

427
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:42,382
or it's game over again,

428
00:18:42,425 --> 00:18:45,211
and I need it to be fixed
before I go as nuts as you,

429
00:18:45,254 --> 00:18:46,908
so just sit this round out...

430
00:18:46,951 --> 00:18:48,257
- No.
- And I'll go alone.

431
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:49,606
No, no, no. Please, please.

432
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,042
I can...

433
00:18:51,086 --> 00:18:52,479
You can't.

434
00:18:52,522 --> 00:18:54,152
Keep it together,
I can keep it together.

435
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:55,936
- See you yesterday.
- I can keep it together.

436
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,267
Please. No, Margo.

437
00:19:28,254 --> 00:19:31,039
I'm feeling the wrong kind
of boned right now.

438
00:19:31,082 --> 00:19:32,693
Okay.

439
00:19:32,736 --> 00:19:34,608
I'm sorry.

440
00:19:34,651 --> 00:19:36,479
What you said yesterday...

441
00:19:36,523 --> 00:19:38,220
Yesterday at Westbrook's house?

442
00:19:44,661 --> 00:19:47,447
Yesterday before you went
to Fisher Beach.

443
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,624
I didn't go to Fisher Beach.

444
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:53,279
- You don't...
- At around 10 p.m.

445
00:19:53,322 --> 00:19:55,977
- We have 12 hours.
- You don't remember.

446
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,457
Remember that tit-chafe Marina

447
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,720
showed up and broke the moon?
How could I forget?

448
00:20:03,158 --> 00:20:06,161
Did Josh just sneeze
on the pizza?

449
00:20:13,168 --> 00:20:14,691
So let's release that ache,

450
00:20:14,735 --> 00:20:17,216
that desire for control.

451
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:21,220
Understand the moment we're in.
Accept our state of being.

452
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:23,134
Take a breath.

453
00:20:23,178 --> 00:20:26,312
Send a prayer up to the god
of your understanding.

454
00:20:26,355 --> 00:20:29,445
Send a prayer and accept. Amen.

455
00:20:29,489 --> 00:20:32,143
Amen, - Thank you.

456
00:20:32,187 --> 00:20:36,191
You've momentarily lessened
my existential dread.

457
00:20:40,326 --> 00:20:43,198
This may be the end.

458
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:46,070
No, I'm not reading this.

459
00:20:46,114 --> 00:20:48,334
Okay, asshole.

460
00:20:48,377 --> 00:20:50,074
Bring it.

461
00:20:50,118 --> 00:20:52,207
I just wanna say...

462
00:20:53,469 --> 00:20:58,082
This world is flawed.

463
00:20:58,126 --> 00:21:01,477
We each have good in us...
and bad.

464
00:21:01,521 --> 00:21:04,306
Every day we fight
to let the good win.

465
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:07,178
This... this is the last day.

466
00:21:07,222 --> 00:21:09,093
Think about those who you love.

467
00:21:09,137 --> 00:21:11,487
Turn off the TV
and be with them.

468
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:12,531
Thank you and good...

469
00:21:15,752 --> 00:21:17,188
I'm sorry.

470
00:21:17,232 --> 00:21:19,190
Were you listening to that?

471
00:21:19,234 --> 00:21:21,628
It was so depressing.

472
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:23,325
Not really.

473
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:25,240
Hey, you okay?

474
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,241
Not really.

475
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,330
Me neither.

476
00:21:28,374 --> 00:21:31,028
Cookie?

477
00:21:31,072 --> 00:21:32,334
Yeah.

478
00:21:34,728 --> 00:21:36,686
I have to admit...

479
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,514
I don't think their spell
will work.

480
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:41,474
It won't.

481
00:21:41,517 --> 00:21:44,390
Can't believe I'm about to die.

482
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:47,393
You are, but...

483
00:21:47,436 --> 00:21:50,657
then you'll just
start all over again.

484
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:55,052
We're in a time loop.

485
00:21:55,096 --> 00:21:56,663
Shut up.

486
00:21:56,706 --> 00:21:59,230
Seriously?

487
00:21:59,274 --> 00:22:00,536
That's a relief.

488
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,539
Like, uh, "Groundhog Day"?

489
00:22:03,583 --> 00:22:05,106
Or "Russian Doll"?

490
00:22:05,149 --> 00:22:07,674
Or "Happy Death Day"
or "Happy Death Day 2U"?

491
00:22:07,717 --> 00:22:08,762
Or "Source Code"?

492
00:22:08,805 --> 00:22:11,373
Oh, that "X-Files".
The "Star Trek".

493
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:13,680
"Edge of Tomorrow" but really
"All You Need Is Kill"

494
00:22:13,723 --> 00:22:16,552
and it's, like, why change
the title like that, right?

495
00:22:16,596 --> 00:22:18,119
Wow.

496
00:22:18,162 --> 00:22:20,469
You really love
time loop stories, don't you?

497
00:22:20,513 --> 00:22:22,123
And you're awake in the loop.

498
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:24,473
You're the hero.
I am totally jealous.

499
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:31,262
Hey, you wanna get out of here?

500
00:22:31,306 --> 00:22:33,177
I've got this place
on my bucket list

501
00:22:33,221 --> 00:22:35,658
and well, uh...
It's gotta be now.

502
00:22:35,702 --> 00:22:38,792
- And to Sharon Cappanelli
FROM NINTH GRADE: I lied.

503
00:22:38,835 --> 00:22:40,620
- Man.
- It was my tampon,

504
00:22:40,663 --> 00:22:42,839
- and that was your girlfriend.
- Time loops.

505
00:22:42,883 --> 00:22:44,711
Gnarly.

506
00:22:44,754 --> 00:22:47,148
Extremely gnarly.

507
00:22:47,191 --> 00:22:48,430
So you're talking
to me about it.

508
00:22:48,454 --> 00:22:51,282
Yeah.

509
00:22:51,326 --> 00:22:54,721
As opposed
to Alice, Julia, or Kady.

510
00:22:54,764 --> 00:22:56,810
Or, to state the obvious,

511
00:22:56,853 --> 00:22:58,420
Margo.

512
00:22:58,464 --> 00:23:01,423
I kind of blew it
beyond repair with Margo.

513
00:23:01,467 --> 00:23:02,859
How is anything beyond repair

514
00:23:02,903 --> 00:23:05,906
when you're stuck
in a time loop?

515
00:23:05,949 --> 00:23:07,429
Well,

516
00:23:07,473 --> 00:23:10,214
she was awake with me
for a while and then

517
00:23:10,258 --> 00:23:14,784
she got kicked out somehow,
and now I am utterly alone.

518
00:23:14,828 --> 00:23:16,830
Well, if I'm learning anything

519
00:23:16,873 --> 00:23:19,441
from these squishy pierogi tacos

520
00:23:19,485 --> 00:23:21,225
is that not everything
belongs together.

521
00:23:23,837 --> 00:23:25,621
How can we help?

522
00:23:25,665 --> 00:23:27,754
Help save the world?

523
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:31,627
Honestly, I don't know.

524
00:23:31,671 --> 00:23:34,674
It might not be possible.

525
00:23:34,717 --> 00:23:37,198
This might be it.

526
00:23:37,241 --> 00:23:41,811
Me, alone,
in this particular 12 hours.

527
00:23:41,855 --> 00:23:43,596
Eternally.

528
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:44,814
Okay.

529
00:23:44,858 --> 00:23:47,643
Sounds like a lot for you.

530
00:23:47,687 --> 00:23:51,647
So, uh, anything I can do
to help you?

531
00:23:51,691 --> 00:23:54,171
I wish.

532
00:23:54,215 --> 00:23:56,522
Because the longer this goes
on, the more certain I am

533
00:23:56,565 --> 00:23:59,481
that the Monster is inside
of me and trying to get out.

534
00:23:59,525 --> 00:24:01,962
Good metaphor.

535
00:24:02,005 --> 00:24:03,659
I'm being literal.

536
00:24:03,703 --> 00:24:05,487
Oh.

537
00:24:05,531 --> 00:24:06,531
Shit.

538
00:24:08,316 --> 00:24:09,709
It's worse every loop.

539
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,276
I hear its voice,

540
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,453
I see blood on the walls,

541
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:17,543
I... I see this door.

542
00:24:17,586 --> 00:24:19,675
It wants out.

543
00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:21,503
Have you tried letting it out?

544
00:24:21,547 --> 00:24:23,505
Why in God's name
would I do that?

545
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:24,941
I... I... I'm just spitballing.

546
00:24:24,985 --> 00:24:27,814
A lot of the time
in these movies

547
00:24:27,857 --> 00:24:29,685
the solution of the problem

548
00:24:29,729 --> 00:24:33,428
is facing the thing
you're most afraid of.

549
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:36,257
What if I die?

550
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,606
What if you do?

551
00:24:45,614 --> 00:24:47,964
Why?!

552
00:24:48,008 --> 00:24:50,489
Anyway.

553
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:52,708
You're not upset
you're about to die?

554
00:24:55,755 --> 00:24:58,888
I don't love it.

555
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:01,282
But you'll figure out a way
to fix this.

556
00:25:08,724 --> 00:25:10,572
The world's greatest minds

557
00:25:10,596 --> 00:25:11,747
are locked in a desperate race
to save humanity.

558
00:25:11,771 --> 00:25:13,381
Everything I'm seeing says

559
00:25:13,424 --> 00:25:14,880
the first chunk's gotta hit
around 10 p.m.

560
00:25:14,904 --> 00:25:17,472
We have 12 hours.

561
00:25:19,387 --> 00:25:21,365
What if we create a massive
portal in the atmosphere?

562
00:25:21,389 --> 00:25:22,608
We'd need a specialist.

563
00:26:23,538 --> 00:26:24,974
Charlton?

564
00:26:25,018 --> 00:26:26,106
Well, fuck!

565
00:26:31,459 --> 00:26:33,635
How the hell are you here?

566
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,420
I was trapped
wandering your Remembrances

567
00:26:36,464 --> 00:26:39,336
when mercifully you decided
not to sleep for five days

568
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,860
and broke your brain.

569
00:26:40,903 --> 00:26:43,514
That gave me an opening
to contact you.

570
00:26:43,558 --> 00:26:45,386
That voice?

571
00:26:45,429 --> 00:26:46,735
That was you?

572
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:48,519
Yes, of course.

573
00:26:48,563 --> 00:26:50,391
When all the scary creatures
were pulled out,

574
00:26:50,434 --> 00:26:52,611
I held on tight as I could
in your Happy Place,

575
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:55,309
and, well... here we are.

576
00:26:56,571 --> 00:26:58,791
This place was so vivid
in your mind,

577
00:26:58,834 --> 00:27:01,881
but there is nothing
like the real thing, is there?

578
00:27:01,924 --> 00:27:05,667
The sights, the sounds, the...

579
00:27:05,711 --> 00:27:06,842
Smells!

580
00:27:06,886 --> 00:27:10,629
Oh, I forgot about smells,
Eliot.

581
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:12,500
They're overwhelmingly
unpleasant.

582
00:27:12,543 --> 00:27:15,590
- Those messages?
- That was you, too?

583
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,724
"I'm still here"? "Let me out"?

584
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:19,812
Yes.

585
00:27:19,855 --> 00:27:21,596
I wanted you to know

586
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,052
that I was still here
and I wanted to be let out.

587
00:27:23,076 --> 00:27:25,731
In red paint?

588
00:27:25,774 --> 00:27:27,907
Right, like strawberries
and Santa Claus.

589
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,648
And blood, Charlton.

590
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:31,345
Well, perhaps
it was a touch ominous.

591
00:27:31,388 --> 00:27:32,781
As was the creepy whisper.

592
00:27:32,825 --> 00:27:33,889
I was trying to be polite.

593
00:27:33,913 --> 00:27:34,957
Well...

594
00:27:37,786 --> 00:27:40,615
It is nice to have a
non-imaginary imaginary friend

595
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,008
for the end of the world,
I guess.

596
00:27:42,051 --> 00:27:43,444
Half-imaginary.

597
00:27:43,487 --> 00:27:46,447
I was passenger
in your unconscious.

598
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:50,712
Now, I'm still in your head.

599
00:27:50,756 --> 00:27:52,758
But the conscious part?

600
00:27:52,801 --> 00:27:55,935
I can't tell you how much
of an improvement this is.

601
00:27:55,978 --> 00:27:57,763
Your Happy Place is nice

602
00:27:57,806 --> 00:28:00,591
and I was able to see
everything you were doing here,

603
00:28:00,635 --> 00:28:02,550
but...

604
00:28:02,593 --> 00:28:05,553
well, there's no substitute
for being heard.

605
00:28:05,596 --> 00:28:07,487
Especially since I often
disagree with your choices,

606
00:28:07,511 --> 00:28:08,948
and I'd like
to share my opinions.

607
00:28:08,991 --> 00:28:10,776
Oh, that's peachy.

608
00:28:10,819 --> 00:28:12,516
Well, let's start now.

609
00:28:14,518 --> 00:28:17,478
Opinion on what to do next?

610
00:28:17,521 --> 00:28:19,349
Oh, well, I'd think
that's obvious.

611
00:28:19,393 --> 00:28:21,395
Is it?

612
00:28:21,438 --> 00:28:22,875
In case you didn't notice,

613
00:28:22,918 --> 00:28:24,983
Margo was sort of driving
the bus on this whole thing

614
00:28:25,007 --> 00:28:26,705
before I screwed up
and lost her.

615
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:28,968
You didn't lose her, Eliot.

616
00:28:29,011 --> 00:28:30,839
She's out of the loops,
Charlton.

617
00:28:30,883 --> 00:28:34,103
No, I simply mean
I don't think that's about you.

618
00:28:34,147 --> 00:28:37,977
I think she got too close
to the answer.

619
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,674
Perhaps that's why

620
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:43,373
she was thrown from
your shared loop experience.

621
00:28:43,417 --> 00:28:46,028
That does have
the ring of logic to it.

622
00:28:46,072 --> 00:28:48,117
Margo mentioned a beach,
did she not?

623
00:28:48,161 --> 00:28:50,598
Fisher Beach.

624
00:28:52,034 --> 00:28:54,950
Okay.

625
00:28:54,994 --> 00:28:56,430
Let's go.

626
00:28:56,473 --> 00:28:59,128
Why is there no one here?

627
00:28:59,172 --> 00:29:00,695
I think it's a

628
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,350
cancel-your-beach-trip
kind of day today.

629
00:29:03,393 --> 00:29:04,830
Psst... keep your eyes peeled

630
00:29:04,873 --> 00:29:07,876
for anyone or anything
who might not want us here.

631
00:29:12,185 --> 00:29:14,578
Is that phone wire?

632
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:22,064
Are phones generally used
underwater?

633
00:29:27,591 --> 00:29:29,550
I think we got a lead.

634
00:29:29,593 --> 00:29:31,160
Lifeguard station 17.

635
00:29:31,204 --> 00:29:32,596
That's the same track
Margo was on.

636
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,076
This didn't go well for her,

637
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,750
so perhaps we should discuss
before going in there, okay?

638
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,645
Ovary up, Charlton.

639
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,876
Uh...

640
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:52,051
I guess...

641
00:29:52,094 --> 00:29:55,054
off and whales?

642
00:29:56,229 --> 00:29:58,753
What is the
purpose of this distraction?

643
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,060
With whom are we speaking?

644
00:30:01,103 --> 00:30:03,105
We are the whales.

645
00:30:03,149 --> 00:30:05,716
Like...

646
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,196
all of them?

647
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,937
Of course.

648
00:30:08,981 --> 00:30:11,505
Why do you speak through a TV?

649
00:30:11,548 --> 00:30:12,898
Why do you?

650
00:30:12,941 --> 00:30:14,508
What is the nature
of your query?

651
00:30:14,551 --> 00:30:16,989
Okay, I don't really know
how to explain this.

652
00:30:17,032 --> 00:30:18,860
Um...

653
00:30:18,904 --> 00:30:20,993
okay, so you probably don't
know this but we...

654
00:30:21,036 --> 00:30:22,864
We are in a time loop.

655
00:30:22,908 --> 00:30:25,084
We are aware of the disturbance.

656
00:30:25,127 --> 00:30:26,999
Oh, huh.

657
00:30:27,042 --> 00:30:29,218
Whales grok time loops.

658
00:30:30,219 --> 00:30:32,091
So do you happen to remember

659
00:30:32,134 --> 00:30:34,180
if a woman named Margo
came to see you?

660
00:30:34,223 --> 00:30:37,748
Uh, brilliant, about yea high,
maybe a little brusque.

661
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:39,663
A contemptuous creature.

662
00:30:39,707 --> 00:30:42,188
We were compelled to wash away
her temporal immunity.

663
00:30:42,231 --> 00:30:45,800
You took her Permanence off.

664
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,106
Why?

665
00:30:47,149 --> 00:30:50,065
Her manner was appalling.

666
00:30:50,109 --> 00:30:52,502
That...

667
00:30:52,546 --> 00:30:54,896
does sound like Margo, okay.

668
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,768
I apologize for her bedside
manner, and I just...

669
00:30:57,812 --> 00:31:01,860
I humbly and I respectfully
ask, do you...

670
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:05,037
do you have any insight
into this loop that we're in?

671
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,039
Our magic caused it.

672
00:31:08,214 --> 00:31:10,172
You're... magicians?

673
00:31:10,216 --> 00:31:15,134
- Pay attention!
- We will explain once.

674
00:31:15,177 --> 00:31:17,876
Our ancestors made a pact
with the Old Gods

675
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,529
and so we spend our lives

676
00:31:19,573 --> 00:31:21,662
tracing sigils
into the ocean floor.

677
00:31:21,705 --> 00:31:24,186
This task is crucial.

678
00:31:26,014 --> 00:31:27,668
Why?

679
00:31:27,711 --> 00:31:31,802
To ensure the Kraken
stays dormant.

680
00:31:31,846 --> 00:31:33,587
Like the...

681
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,849
the Kraken-kraken?

682
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,633
What's a Kraken-kraken?

683
00:31:36,677 --> 00:31:38,113
Should the Kraken ever awaken

684
00:31:38,157 --> 00:31:41,160
it would soon consume the world.

685
00:31:41,203 --> 00:31:43,989
Okay, got it.

686
00:31:44,032 --> 00:31:46,556
So, the loops. Why?

687
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,993
The moon colliding with Earth

688
00:31:48,036 --> 00:31:49,864
obliterated
our protective sigils

689
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,953
causing the Kraken to rise.

690
00:31:53,999 --> 00:31:55,565
Kinda seems like a hat on a hat

691
00:31:55,609 --> 00:31:57,108
when you've already
got a moon apocalypse.

692
00:31:57,132 --> 00:31:58,655
A bit flippant for a creature

693
00:31:58,699 --> 00:32:01,745
who caused said apocalypse.

694
00:32:01,789 --> 00:32:04,618
Fortunately, our ancestors
implemented a failsafe.

695
00:32:04,661 --> 00:32:07,229
If the Kraken awakens,
it sends Earth back 12 hours

696
00:32:07,273 --> 00:32:11,016
to allow another chance
to avert catastrophe.

697
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:13,627
Whereupon it'll
all just keep happening

698
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,803
because the fucking moon
is broken.

699
00:32:15,846 --> 00:32:17,718
So it would seem.

700
00:32:17,761 --> 00:32:19,981
Well... uh... well,
if you're... if you're magicians,

701
00:32:20,025 --> 00:32:22,853
then maybe you can help
fix the moon?

702
00:32:22,897 --> 00:32:24,029
We cannot.

703
00:32:24,072 --> 00:32:25,987
We must maintain our sigils.

704
00:32:26,031 --> 00:32:27,641
Okay.

705
00:32:27,684 --> 00:32:31,036
If you don't fix the moon,
the Kraken's just...

706
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:32,907
Just gonna keep krakening.

707
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,909
This distraction
has gone on too long.

708
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,171
Wait... no, no, no.

709
00:32:36,215 --> 00:32:37,781
We must attend to the sigils.

710
00:32:37,825 --> 00:32:38,782
- Hold on.
- Do not contact us again.

711
00:32:38,826 --> 00:32:39,870
No, no, no, no, no.

712
00:32:39,914 --> 00:32:41,089
No!

713
00:32:41,133 --> 00:32:43,962
Uh...

714
00:32:44,005 --> 00:32:45,093
oh, shit.

715
00:32:49,054 --> 00:32:52,274
Feeling the wrong kind
of boned right now.

716
00:32:52,318 --> 00:32:54,059
Oh, okay.

717
00:32:54,102 --> 00:32:58,063
Bye, I guess.

718
00:33:00,152 --> 00:33:02,023
What am I supposed to do?

719
00:33:02,067 --> 00:33:04,112
I can't fix the moon.
That won't work.

720
00:33:04,156 --> 00:33:06,985
You can't help,
you're non-corporeal.

721
00:33:07,028 --> 00:33:08,334
True.

722
00:33:11,685 --> 00:33:14,296
But...

723
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,168
you're not alone.

724
00:33:19,345 --> 00:33:22,826
So whales really are
powerful magicians.

725
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,828
I knew they did weird stuff
on the ocean floor,

726
00:33:24,872 --> 00:33:25,829
I just didn't realize it was...

727
00:33:25,873 --> 00:33:27,092
Wait. Yes, Alice...

728
00:33:27,135 --> 00:33:28,745
Tell me what else
you know about whales.

729
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:30,443
Um...

730
00:33:30,486 --> 00:33:32,314
their closest cousin
is the hippo.

731
00:33:32,358 --> 00:33:35,013
Um, their mating season
is in the fall.

732
00:33:35,056 --> 00:33:36,405
That is so sad for them.

733
00:33:36,449 --> 00:33:38,079
What if they never get
to make love again?

734
00:33:38,103 --> 00:33:39,452
Though I am one to talk.

735
00:33:39,495 --> 00:33:40,864
I mean, it's been
over a thousand years.

736
00:33:40,888 --> 00:33:42,281
That's not exactly
what I needed.

737
00:33:42,324 --> 00:33:44,239
Well, you asked me what I knew.

738
00:33:44,283 --> 00:33:46,067
Is there any info
about the Kraken

739
00:33:46,111 --> 00:33:47,721
that might point us
in a direction?

740
00:33:47,764 --> 00:33:49,288
Whoa-ho-ho! Okay.

741
00:33:49,331 --> 00:33:53,901
Well, you have your
Lovecraftian god-Krakens.

742
00:33:53,944 --> 00:33:55,424
Uh, and then there's the.

743
00:33:55,468 --> 00:33:57,861
D&D Kraken
which is sort of six-of-one.

744
00:33:57,905 --> 00:34:01,082
And then, of course,
there's "Clash of the Titans",

745
00:34:01,126 --> 00:34:02,431
both the original

746
00:34:02,475 --> 00:34:03,495
- and the remake.
- Thank you.

747
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,347
With the very famous line...

748
00:34:05,391 --> 00:34:06,870
Thank you, Josh.

749
00:34:08,002 --> 00:34:09,438
Every time the Kraken awakens,

750
00:34:09,482 --> 00:34:11,092
time jumps back 12 hours.

751
00:34:11,136 --> 00:34:12,374
Which would be great
if it took us back

752
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:14,052
to before the moon broke.

753
00:34:14,965 --> 00:34:16,793
What if we

754
00:34:16,837 --> 00:34:19,796
get the time loop spell to
trigger a couple hours early?

755
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,060
Why don't we
just kill all the damn whales?

756
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:24,192
Well, that's clearly
what you tried to do

757
00:34:24,236 --> 00:34:25,846
when they took away
your Permanence.

758
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:27,891
But she's right.

759
00:34:27,935 --> 00:34:30,981
Maybe we need to let out
the thing that scares us.

760
00:34:31,025 --> 00:34:33,506
Maybe we need to, uh, to...

761
00:34:33,549 --> 00:34:34,898
Release the Kraken!

762
00:34:34,942 --> 00:34:37,205
Exactly, yeah.

763
00:34:37,249 --> 00:34:38,815
But earlier.

764
00:34:38,859 --> 00:34:42,515
Early... early enough
to a time before the heist.

765
00:34:42,558 --> 00:34:44,386
Shit, we're almost out of time.

766
00:34:49,174 --> 00:34:51,089
Look, if the whales
have the power

767
00:34:51,132 --> 00:34:54,222
to take away your Permanence,
this could be your last shot.

768
00:34:54,266 --> 00:34:57,399
No presh,
but you're our only hope.

769
00:35:00,402 --> 00:35:02,361
I will do my very best.

770
00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:15,156
Surely, you jest.

771
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,245
I know, I know.

772
00:35:17,289 --> 00:35:19,943
It goes against everything
you've ever believed in,

773
00:35:19,987 --> 00:35:21,206
and I fully respect that,

774
00:35:21,249 --> 00:35:23,121
but the only way to fix this

775
00:35:23,164 --> 00:35:26,863
is to release the Kraken
right now.

776
00:35:27,864 --> 00:35:29,518
Well, I don't think
they liked that.

777
00:35:29,562 --> 00:35:30,954
What? No.

778
00:35:30,998 --> 00:35:32,434
Damn it!

779
00:35:32,478 --> 00:35:34,393
Eliot?

780
00:35:34,436 --> 00:35:36,134
Please be careful.

781
00:35:36,177 --> 00:35:37,961
Uh, you don't know
what they will do.

782
00:35:38,005 --> 00:35:39,049
Hey!

783
00:35:41,008 --> 00:35:42,270
You know I'm right!

784
00:35:43,489 --> 00:35:46,144
I know you're listening.

785
00:35:46,187 --> 00:35:48,842
You know, I have it
on good authority

786
00:35:48,885 --> 00:35:52,019
that mating season
is in the fall.

787
00:35:52,062 --> 00:35:53,455
Do you never wanna fuck again?

788
00:35:53,499 --> 00:35:55,153
Eliot, that was too personal.

789
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:56,458
Uh...

790
00:35:56,502 --> 00:35:58,460
okay, uh, sorry.

791
00:35:58,504 --> 00:36:01,594
Look, I get it.

792
00:36:01,637 --> 00:36:03,596
Look, I get it...
Your ancestors made a deal,

793
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:06,120
but special circumstances, okay?

794
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,557
Just let it out for 30 seconds.

795
00:36:08,601 --> 00:36:11,560
I will fix this
and then, you know, uh,

796
00:36:11,604 --> 00:36:14,346
the Kraken will be back
in its safe little sea bed

797
00:36:14,389 --> 00:36:18,524
and, uh, you can maintain your
sigils for all of eternity.

798
00:36:18,567 --> 00:36:20,526
You gotta trust me.

799
00:36:20,569 --> 00:36:23,224
Just release the goddamn Kraken.

800
00:36:23,268 --> 00:36:26,532
Please, please, please,
please, please.

801
00:36:29,491 --> 00:36:30,491
Look.

802
00:36:53,602 --> 00:36:54,864
Hi there!

803
00:36:54,908 --> 00:36:57,389
Uh...

804
00:36:57,432 --> 00:36:59,260
are you the Kraken?

805
00:36:59,304 --> 00:37:01,436
No.

806
00:37:08,313 --> 00:37:09,879
Josh, Margo, Penny.

807
00:37:09,923 --> 00:37:11,533
You guys go inside,
loop all the cameras,

808
00:37:11,577 --> 00:37:13,231
open the side door for Natasha.

809
00:37:13,274 --> 00:37:15,276
I'll be outside waiting
with Eliot and Alice.

810
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,060
Holy shit.

811
00:37:17,104 --> 00:37:19,019
Holy shit.

812
00:37:19,062 --> 00:37:20,586
Holy shit.

813
00:37:20,629 --> 00:37:24,242
This is before the moon broke.

814
00:37:24,285 --> 00:37:25,895
It worked.

815
00:37:25,939 --> 00:37:27,375
- Okay, break.
- Sorry.

816
00:37:31,423 --> 00:37:33,381
Um, could you just, uh...
Could you...

817
00:37:33,425 --> 00:37:34,576
You're freaking out, aren't you?

818
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,123
- No.
- Look, you can pull

819
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:38,168
the ripcord now.
Get out, we'll handle this.

820
00:37:38,212 --> 00:37:40,170
Margo.

821
00:37:40,214 --> 00:37:43,086
Credenza.

822
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:45,480
Don't ask questions,
just do what you say?

823
00:37:45,524 --> 00:37:47,395
Mm-hmm.

824
00:37:47,439 --> 00:37:49,310
Fine.

825
00:37:49,354 --> 00:37:51,181
Okay.

826
00:37:51,225 --> 00:37:53,140
Slight change of plans.

827
00:37:54,576 --> 00:37:56,622
We are so close
to saving everyone.

828
00:37:56,665 --> 00:37:57,686
You can't take that away
from us now.

829
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,189
Look, whatever it is
you're after

830
00:37:59,233 --> 00:38:00,776
what's the point
if there's no world left?

831
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,412
There'll still be a world,
just not as many people.

832
00:38:04,456 --> 00:38:05,805
Have you met people?

833
00:38:05,848 --> 00:38:09,069
I've met people, many people.

834
00:38:09,112 --> 00:38:10,897
How many people have you met?

835
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:13,769
Because I bet
I've met more people.

836
00:38:13,813 --> 00:38:16,206
What the fuck is wrong with you?

837
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:17,947
Hi.

838
00:38:17,991 --> 00:38:19,601
What the hell did...

839
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,083
Hell, yes.

840
00:38:26,652 --> 00:38:28,175
What the... how did you...

841
00:38:28,218 --> 00:38:29,655
Julia, now.

842
00:38:54,244 --> 00:38:55,202
Hey!

843
00:38:55,245 --> 00:38:56,986
Hot pizza!

844
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:59,249
That's one pizza
we definitely can enjoy.

845
00:38:59,293 --> 00:39:02,165
All right.
Oh, nice pour right there.

846
00:39:03,776 --> 00:39:06,126
Yes, cheers, cheers, yes.

847
00:39:06,169 --> 00:39:07,736
Bam!

848
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,216
- All right, Emeril.
- Fresco pizza!

849
00:39:09,259 --> 00:39:11,697
Yes, cheers.

850
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:12,785
Whoo!

851
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:23,448
You don't want a drink?

852
00:39:25,667 --> 00:39:28,714
Actually, I desperately do not.

853
00:39:28,757 --> 00:39:30,169
- That's concerning.
- Those time loops

854
00:39:30,193 --> 00:39:32,195
must've really did
a number on you.

855
00:39:33,719 --> 00:39:34,981
So...

856
00:39:36,243 --> 00:39:39,725
You're right,
I have been pushing you away.

857
00:39:39,768 --> 00:39:42,554
Yeah, no shit.

858
00:39:42,597 --> 00:39:44,599
It's just...

859
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:52,651
I do remember the Monster.

860
00:39:52,694 --> 00:39:57,003
It was bad and bloody and, um...

861
00:39:58,744 --> 00:40:01,050
Those memories are, like,
right here.

862
00:40:01,094 --> 00:40:03,792
And, um...

863
00:40:03,836 --> 00:40:05,925
you know, maybe I really do
need that drink.

864
00:40:05,968 --> 00:40:08,797
I don't get why you feel like
you have to go it alone.

865
00:40:12,888 --> 00:40:15,238
I don't either.

866
00:40:15,282 --> 00:40:17,240
My logical brain
knows without a doubt

867
00:40:17,284 --> 00:40:18,981
that I'm better with you.

868
00:40:19,025 --> 00:40:20,635
Yes, and same.

869
00:40:26,293 --> 00:40:28,730
Tell your coping mechanisms
to back off...

870
00:40:30,297 --> 00:40:32,517
Or I'll punch 'em in the dick.

871
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:35,694
During the loops,
we were in it together

872
00:40:35,737 --> 00:40:38,305
and then you were gone, and...

873
00:40:38,348 --> 00:40:40,133
shocking revelation...

874
00:40:40,176 --> 00:40:41,937
I am utterly miserable
when you're not around.

875
00:40:41,961 --> 00:40:44,529
Yeah, I know.

876
00:40:44,572 --> 00:40:46,095
I don't know
if that's fair to you.

877
00:40:46,139 --> 00:40:49,098
What are you talking about?

878
00:40:49,142 --> 00:40:50,709
The other thing I learned

879
00:40:50,752 --> 00:40:53,712
being in the loops
with you for so long...

880
00:40:53,755 --> 00:40:56,715
you're not exactly
who you used to be.

881
00:40:56,758 --> 00:40:57,759
You've...

882
00:40:57,803 --> 00:40:59,152
Please don't say aged.

883
00:40:59,195 --> 00:41:03,199
You've evolved, Margo Hanson.

884
00:41:03,243 --> 00:41:04,897
You've become more
of your true self.

885
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,986
You've earned it.

886
00:41:09,336 --> 00:41:12,252
And I don't want to ask you
to take a step back

887
00:41:12,295 --> 00:41:14,994
just so I can try and catch up.

888
00:41:15,037 --> 00:41:16,386
Oh.

889
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:18,214
I was a mess you had
to untangle in there

890
00:41:18,258 --> 00:41:22,697
just so you could soldier on,
and... once you did,

891
00:41:22,741 --> 00:41:25,265
you figured out
how to fix all of this.

892
00:41:25,308 --> 00:41:26,416
And then you picked up the baton

893
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,007
and actually did the thing.

894
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:30,749
- I got lucky.
- No.

895
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:38,321
It's 'cause you understand me
better than anyone.

896
00:41:38,365 --> 00:41:41,281
Mm-hmm.

897
00:41:41,324 --> 00:41:42,891
So quit acting
like you're the screw-up

898
00:41:42,935 --> 00:41:44,763
and get on my level, El.

899
00:41:48,114 --> 00:41:50,290
You did it.

900
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:52,074
You did when the world
was on the line,

901
00:41:52,118 --> 00:41:53,989
now do it for yourself.

902
00:42:03,172 --> 00:42:05,174
I don't know
if I want to get on your level

903
00:42:05,218 --> 00:42:07,046
knowing that you
jacked off Todd.

904
00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:09,831
- I did not.
- Yeah, you did.

905
00:42:10,832 --> 00:42:12,921
I did not.

906
00:42:18,405 --> 00:42:19,362
The hell?

907
00:42:19,406 --> 00:42:20,799
Coming.

908
00:42:22,322 --> 00:42:24,193
Oh, thank God!

909
00:42:24,237 --> 00:42:25,455
I've tried every other

910
00:42:25,499 --> 00:42:27,327
magical Penthouse
in the city and...

911
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:29,982
Todd. Wh... uh, what...

912
00:42:30,025 --> 00:42:31,461
Why are you here?

913
00:42:31,505 --> 00:42:33,333
I need your help.

914
00:42:33,376 --> 00:42:35,050
Something just happened that
feels way above my pay grade,

915
00:42:35,074 --> 00:42:36,399
and you were the first
person I thought of

916
00:42:36,423 --> 00:42:38,120
who could help me handle it.

917
00:42:38,164 --> 00:42:40,340
Okay, it's a weird one.
Just hear me out, okay?

918
00:42:40,383 --> 00:42:44,300
So this pig dude
who kind of looks like

919
00:42:44,344 --> 00:42:46,128
that one guy
Paul Giamatti played

920
00:42:46,172 --> 00:42:47,826
in that one show
with all the wigs

921
00:42:47,869 --> 00:42:49,479
told me I'm supposed
to do a quest.

922
00:42:49,523 --> 00:42:51,177
Seriously?

923
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,135
That asshole went to you?

924
00:42:53,179 --> 00:42:55,007
Wow. Ha.

925
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:57,705
Yeah, he's extremely committed
to finding a dude.

926
00:42:57,749 --> 00:43:00,795
Yeah, it's fine, Todd.
We fixed it.

927
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:03,929
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yes, I'm sure.

928
00:43:03,972 --> 00:43:06,148
The Harmonic Convergence
isn't happening anymore.

929
00:43:06,192 --> 00:43:07,715
The who now?

930
00:43:07,759 --> 00:43:09,238
The end of the world?

931
00:43:09,282 --> 00:43:10,805
Uh, no.

932
00:43:10,849 --> 00:43:14,113
He did say the end of something
but not that.

933
00:43:14,156 --> 00:43:16,028
He was talking about Fillory.

934
00:43:16,071 --> 00:43:18,117
Remind me, is Fillory real?

935
00:43:20,162 --> 00:43:23,296
The end of Fillory?

936
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:24,471
So...

937
00:43:24,514 --> 00:43:26,821
so we saved the wrong world?

938
00:43:30,912 --> 00:43:32,871
So we're not done.

939
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:38,224
Of course.
