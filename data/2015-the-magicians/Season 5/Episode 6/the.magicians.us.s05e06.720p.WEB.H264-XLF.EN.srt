1
00:00:07,072 --> 00:00:09,379
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:09,422 --> 00:00:10,661
You're not right, El,
and we both know why.

3
00:00:10,685 --> 00:00:11,836
You said you don't remember
what happened

4
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:12,817
when you were possessed,
but Julia does.

5
00:00:12,861 --> 00:00:14,210
And I don't.

6
00:00:14,253 --> 00:00:16,865
I don't know why
you're accusing me of lying.

7
00:00:16,908 --> 00:00:19,955
Eliot, let me out.

8
00:00:19,998 --> 00:00:21,260
We're looking for Stoppard.

9
00:00:21,304 --> 00:00:23,001
Mom? Mom, what's wrong?

10
00:00:23,045 --> 00:00:25,134
Moms die every day.
Circle of life.

11
00:00:25,177 --> 00:00:27,025
We know you're trying
to look out for your mom.

12
00:00:27,049 --> 00:00:28,354
You're saying you'll leave?

13
00:00:28,398 --> 00:00:30,095
- Sorry, man.
- I'm not going anywhere.

14
00:00:30,139 --> 00:00:31,967
The Harmonic Convergence.

15
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:33,708
AKA the end of the world.

16
00:00:33,751 --> 00:00:34,946
The convergence will only occur

17
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,928
during this perfect alignment.

18
00:00:36,972 --> 00:00:39,409
If we move the moon
out of position...

19
00:00:39,452 --> 00:00:42,717
No Convergence,
no Circumstance, no apocalypse.

20
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,023
If you have moon brain,
then you will see her aura.

21
00:00:45,067 --> 00:00:47,112
If it is green,
she is listening.

22
00:00:47,156 --> 00:00:50,855
Only then may you ask her
to move.

23
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:53,379
You will need a piece of her.
- Like a moon rock?

24
00:00:53,423 --> 00:00:54,859
In here, boss.

25
00:00:54,903 --> 00:00:57,035
Ladies.

26
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:58,123
You're moving the moon?

27
00:00:58,167 --> 00:00:59,167
Yeah.

28
00:01:02,998 --> 00:01:05,217
Uh, guys?

29
00:01:05,261 --> 00:01:07,306
I think we broke the moon.

30
00:01:09,205 --> 00:01:11,207
NASA estimates just hours

31
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,818
before the first pieces
reach our atmosphere.

32
00:01:13,862 --> 00:01:17,169
In a tweet, the president
stressed the need for calm,

33
00:01:17,213 --> 00:01:20,738
saying, "We will fix
the moon decisively.

34
00:01:20,782 --> 00:01:24,437
The American people have
absolutely nothing to fear."

35
00:01:31,227 --> 00:01:35,231
I know we are dealing
with the lunapocalypse problem,

36
00:01:35,274 --> 00:01:37,973
but I have to insist
that we all take a minute

37
00:01:38,016 --> 00:01:41,150
for a little
self-care/pizza, okay?

38
00:01:41,193 --> 00:01:42,238
Okay.

39
00:01:42,281 --> 00:01:43,979
Cautioning everyone that

40
00:01:44,022 --> 00:01:45,937
though the world appears
to be coming to an end,

41
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:48,157
everyone's behavior
will still be counted

42
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,941
when the time comes
for judgment.

43
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:53,249
Feeling the wrong kind
of boned right now.

44
00:01:53,292 --> 00:01:55,120
At least
the Harmonic Convergence

45
00:01:55,164 --> 00:01:56,731
isn't happening anymore.

46
00:01:59,298 --> 00:02:02,214
I just have this bad feeling.

47
00:02:02,258 --> 00:02:03,825
Hey.

48
00:02:03,868 --> 00:02:06,741
We'll figure out
how to stop this.

49
00:02:06,784 --> 00:02:09,308
I mean, on the off-chance
the president doesn't.

50
00:02:09,352 --> 00:02:11,136
Let's review.

51
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,096
Emergency code words
if this all goes shit-shaped?

52
00:02:14,139 --> 00:02:16,098
Um...

53
00:02:16,141 --> 00:02:17,316
Really?

54
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,491
Kidding. Okay.

55
00:02:19,536 --> 00:02:20,798
As follows.

56
00:02:20,842 --> 00:02:23,018
"Credenza," no questions asked.

57
00:02:23,061 --> 00:02:24,541
"Inglenook," tie those fools up,

58
00:02:24,584 --> 00:02:26,325
toss 'em through
the Fillory portal.

59
00:02:26,369 --> 00:02:28,110
"Chifforobe," flee to Canada.

60
00:02:28,153 --> 00:02:30,025
"Armoire," shield up, stat.

61
00:02:30,068 --> 00:02:31,287
"Kimono"...

62
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,897
both:
All hell has broken loose.

63
00:02:32,941 --> 00:02:35,857
Time and hope
are quickly running out.

64
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,468
Everything I'm seeing says
the first chunk's gonna hit

65
00:02:38,511 --> 00:02:40,818
around 10:00 p.m.

66
00:02:40,862 --> 00:02:42,298
We have 12 hours.

67
00:02:46,258 --> 00:02:47,259
Uh, look.

68
00:02:47,303 --> 00:02:48,497
What if we created
a massive portal

69
00:02:48,521 --> 00:02:49,914
in the atmosphere?

70
00:02:49,958 --> 00:02:51,022
No, we need a specialist,

71
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:53,962
and the meta-math is just...
it's too...

72
00:02:54,005 --> 00:02:55,833
this is really bad, Julia.

73
00:02:55,877 --> 00:02:57,443
Nuh-uh.

74
00:02:57,487 --> 00:02:59,837
Don't you dare give up.

75
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:02,448
This math
is so damn frustrating.

76
00:03:02,492 --> 00:03:03,885
Yeah, but you'll get it.

77
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:07,845
Jesus.

78
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:09,151
What happened to your shoe?

79
00:03:09,194 --> 00:03:10,369
Have you been out there?

80
00:03:10,413 --> 00:03:12,937
It is the literal end
of the actual world.

81
00:03:12,981 --> 00:03:14,461
No, it's not.
We're gonna stop it.

82
00:03:14,504 --> 00:03:16,854
Yeah, tell that to the
rioters and the prayer circles

83
00:03:16,898 --> 00:03:18,856
and people fucking
in the streets.

84
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,423
I can't believe
this is happening.

85
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:22,468
I'm just numb.

86
00:03:22,512 --> 00:03:25,167
Try the truffled prosciutto,
it's incredible.

87
00:03:27,038 --> 00:03:29,084
I did have one idea

88
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:31,303
after my very bad idea
to take the subway.

89
00:03:31,347 --> 00:03:34,306
Okay, do you know Richard's
Reverse Entropy spell?

90
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,457
We already talked about it.

91
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:36,632
Unfortunately, it's just
way too small.

92
00:03:36,656 --> 00:03:39,137
True, but I reworked it.

93
00:03:39,181 --> 00:03:41,966
And check my math.

94
00:03:44,316 --> 00:03:47,406
This is fantastic, but...

95
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:50,061
I don't think we have
enough cooperative power.

96
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,324
Chances are high for a surge
in the next 12 hours.

97
00:03:52,368 --> 00:03:53,369
We could use it.

98
00:03:53,412 --> 00:03:54,979
And we have enough hedges

99
00:03:55,023 --> 00:03:59,505
around the world on standby
to do it with us, so...

100
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:01,464
That might not be enough.

101
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:02,595
We make it enough.

102
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:04,380
Today we are saving the world,

103
00:04:04,423 --> 00:04:06,991
and this time it's gonna stick.

104
00:04:07,035 --> 00:04:08,079
Damn right, we are.

105
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:09,907
Okay.

106
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,519
But just in case...

107
00:04:14,607 --> 00:04:18,046
Anything I need to say to you?

108
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:19,177
Jules, we're good.

109
00:04:22,964 --> 00:04:24,966
Scientists around the world

110
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:26,619
have been sending out
their predictions

111
00:04:26,663 --> 00:04:28,534
for what we should expect
in the coming hours.

112
00:04:28,578 --> 00:04:31,189
Though the tides remain
mysteriously intact,

113
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:33,496
expect volcanic activity,

114
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:36,542
tectonic shifts,
disrupted weather patterns,

115
00:04:36,586 --> 00:04:39,023
and strange behavior
from animal life.

116
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:45,116
And to Sharon Cappanelli
from ninth grade:

117
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,552
I lied.

118
00:04:46,596 --> 00:04:48,946
It was my tampon,
and that was your girlfriend.

119
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,295
I'm not sorry.

120
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:52,036
Thanks for spreading
the word, Pete.

121
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,124
Stand by.

122
00:04:54,604 --> 00:04:55,997
Everyone's set.

123
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,476
We're just waiting
for the surge.

124
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,404
You guys feel that?

125
00:05:12,448 --> 00:05:13,492
It's the surge.

126
00:05:13,536 --> 00:05:15,103
- It's cresting.
- We should...

127
00:05:15,146 --> 00:05:16,931
- Go.
- Pete, now!

128
00:05:36,298 --> 00:05:37,603
Did it work?

129
00:05:45,481 --> 00:05:47,396
It didn't work.

130
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:49,964
We failed.

131
00:06:09,157 --> 00:06:12,029
Feeling the wrong kind
of boned...

132
00:06:12,073 --> 00:06:13,639
right now.

133
00:06:13,683 --> 00:06:16,164
At least the Harmonic
Convergence

134
00:06:16,207 --> 00:06:17,992
isn't happening anymore.

135
00:06:18,035 --> 00:06:19,558
Although the world's
greatest minds

136
00:06:19,602 --> 00:06:21,473
are locked in a desperate race
to save humanity

137
00:06:21,517 --> 00:06:23,649
from this sudden
lunar cataclysm,

138
00:06:23,693 --> 00:06:26,348
time and hope
are quickly running out.

139
00:06:26,391 --> 00:06:28,152
Everything I'm seeing
says the first chunk's

140
00:06:28,176 --> 00:06:29,481
gonna hit around 10:00 p.m.

141
00:06:29,525 --> 00:06:31,309
We have 12 hours.

142
00:06:35,096 --> 00:06:36,053
Uh, look, what if we created

143
00:06:36,097 --> 00:06:37,533
a massive portal
in the atmosphere?

144
00:06:37,576 --> 00:06:40,057
We need a specialist,
and the meta-math is just...

145
00:06:40,101 --> 00:06:42,407
it's too... this
is really bad, Julia.

146
00:06:42,451 --> 00:06:44,105
Am I crazy, or...

147
00:06:44,148 --> 00:06:45,715
This already happened, right?

148
00:06:45,758 --> 00:06:47,412
This math is so damn
frustrating.

149
00:06:47,456 --> 00:06:48,674
This did.

150
00:06:48,718 --> 00:06:50,502
This did already happen.

151
00:06:50,546 --> 00:06:51,634
Ow!

152
00:06:51,677 --> 00:06:53,157
Not a dream.

153
00:06:53,201 --> 00:06:55,507
Hey, am I on something,

154
00:06:55,551 --> 00:06:57,509
or did we try this plan
yesterday?

155
00:06:57,553 --> 00:06:58,684
We're...

156
00:06:58,728 --> 00:07:00,599
At Westbrook's estate?

157
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:04,559
Jesus.

158
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:07,128
What happened to your shoe?

159
00:07:07,171 --> 00:07:09,086
Have you been out there?

160
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,306
It's the literal end
of the actual world.

161
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:13,264
- No, it's not.
- We're stopping it.

162
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,092
Tell that to the rioters,
prayer circles,

163
00:07:15,136 --> 00:07:17,442
and people fucking
in the streets.

164
00:07:17,486 --> 00:07:20,228
Both:
We're in a time loop.

165
00:07:22,273 --> 00:07:24,101
Excuse us
while we briefly sidebar.

166
00:07:26,408 --> 00:07:28,453
Why exactly is this happening?

167
00:07:28,497 --> 00:07:30,455
- "Why is anything?"
- he asked,

168
00:07:30,499 --> 00:07:32,216
still freaked, 'cause
the last thing he remembers

169
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,806
is all of Earth ending.

170
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:34,807
It felt so inevitable.

171
00:07:34,851 --> 00:07:35,808
I know.

172
00:07:35,852 --> 00:07:38,115
But why us, now?

173
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,247
Time loop?

174
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:41,553
Of course we're the chosen ones.

175
00:07:41,597 --> 00:07:42,685
We're us.

176
00:07:44,295 --> 00:07:45,557
Okay, everybody.

177
00:07:45,601 --> 00:07:47,124
What is going on with you two?

178
00:07:47,168 --> 00:07:49,213
Quick recap,
Kady's plan won't work.

179
00:07:49,257 --> 00:07:52,521
We tried it, and the moon
still crashed into the Earth.

180
00:07:52,564 --> 00:07:55,437
- Uh, okay.
- What do you mean, "tried it"?

181
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,569
We suspect we're in a time loop.

182
00:07:57,613 --> 00:07:58,788
How?

183
00:07:58,831 --> 00:08:00,616
Obviously...

184
00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:04,402
the moon's a wily cunt
who doesn't wanna die.

185
00:08:04,446 --> 00:08:05,708
Okay.

186
00:08:05,751 --> 00:08:07,840
All right,
so no reverse entropy.

187
00:08:07,884 --> 00:08:09,538
What do you guys suggest?

188
00:08:09,581 --> 00:08:12,149
We cast Vinnola's
Oxygen Saver on Penny 23,

189
00:08:12,193 --> 00:08:13,498
then he travels to the moon.

190
00:08:13,542 --> 00:08:14,891
It's easier
to do a portal there.

191
00:08:14,934 --> 00:08:16,110
Look, GPS is kinda broken.

192
00:08:16,153 --> 00:08:17,328
I might end up in a wall.

193
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:20,418
- It's the apocalypse.
- Gonna need you to try.

194
00:08:23,813 --> 00:08:25,380
Fuck all of you.

195
00:08:25,423 --> 00:08:26,423
Fine.

196
00:08:31,473 --> 00:08:33,257
You got this, man.

197
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:41,787
- Oh... oh, no!
- No!

198
00:08:51,623 --> 00:08:52,581
Okay, forget the moon.

199
00:08:52,624 --> 00:08:54,539
Let's move the Earth.

200
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,280
Kady, get your hedge bitches
on the horn.

201
00:08:56,324 --> 00:08:57,716
We got cooperating to do.

202
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,153
I'm on it.

203
00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:03,157
Okay.

204
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,221
I found a spell that can hold

205
00:09:04,245 --> 00:09:05,645
the pieces in suspension,
we just...

206
00:09:05,681 --> 00:09:08,423
right, good to assume
we can all do sphincter magic?

207
00:09:16,518 --> 00:09:18,476
Could we make this very big?

208
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:22,306
Mother-shit!

209
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,699
You... you okay?

210
00:09:23,742 --> 00:09:26,484
- No, Julia.
- I'm not okay.

211
00:09:26,528 --> 00:09:27,528
Bless you.

212
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,575
Whoa.

213
00:09:30,619 --> 00:09:31,794
Allow me to explain.

214
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:34,318
So here we are, eight loops in.

215
00:09:34,362 --> 00:09:35,928
Ten.

216
00:09:35,972 --> 00:09:37,645
If these loops sent us back
even a little earlier,

217
00:09:37,669 --> 00:09:39,497
we could stop Marina
from bad-touching

218
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,586
this whole situation,
but we can't.

219
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,979
Okay, so we need time magic.

220
00:09:43,022 --> 00:09:44,763
I know a horomancer
who builds machines.

221
00:09:44,807 --> 00:09:45,764
Maybe he has something.

222
00:09:45,808 --> 00:09:47,331
Fantastic, vámanos.

223
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,767
One problem...

224
00:09:48,811 --> 00:09:51,205
I kind of let his mom die
last time I saw him.

225
00:09:51,248 --> 00:09:52,249
Oh.

226
00:09:53,555 --> 00:09:54,991
Oh, come on.

227
00:09:55,034 --> 00:09:56,862
Like you guys are all saints?

228
00:09:56,906 --> 00:09:59,300
You're in a time loop?

229
00:09:59,343 --> 00:10:00,562
Well, why you two?

230
00:10:00,605 --> 00:10:01,563
'Cause we're the best-looking.

231
00:10:01,606 --> 00:10:02,651
Here.

232
00:10:02,694 --> 00:10:04,740
This is Penny's address.

233
00:10:04,783 --> 00:10:05,804
Margo, what are you doing?

234
00:10:05,828 --> 00:10:07,438
Favorite coffee shop,

235
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,571
hipster club where we suspect
he DJ's on the weekend,

236
00:10:09,614 --> 00:10:11,834
and it's your lucky day...
his Travelling's borked,

237
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:13,662
so he's a sitting duck
in a scarf.

238
00:10:13,705 --> 00:10:15,881
Margo, we can't just kill Penny.

239
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:18,536
We don't; he dies anyway,
along with everyone.

240
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,756
This is basic
trolley problem shit.

241
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,800
Ovary up.

242
00:10:21,844 --> 00:10:22,888
Okay.

243
00:10:22,932 --> 00:10:24,368
If I wanted revenge on Penny,

244
00:10:24,412 --> 00:10:26,457
I would've gotten that
a long time ago.

245
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:33,377
You've got particles
all over you.

246
00:10:33,421 --> 00:10:34,615
Were you spritzed
with something?

247
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:35,945
Spritzed, like with what?

248
00:10:35,988 --> 00:10:37,555
Something that nebulized

249
00:10:37,599 --> 00:10:39,383
a cloud of temporal permanence
around you?

250
00:10:39,427 --> 00:10:40,906
Mm.

251
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,604
Both: "Permanence."

252
00:10:43,953 --> 00:10:45,433
For men and women.

253
00:10:45,476 --> 00:10:47,565
Yeah, I may have
accidentally stolen

254
00:10:47,609 --> 00:10:50,873
a weird perfume bottle
from a time witch in Fillory.

255
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:52,744
Okay, whatever you really did,

256
00:10:52,788 --> 00:10:54,268
it's created a field
around you both

257
00:10:54,311 --> 00:10:56,357
that would explain why you're...

258
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,358
in a time loop.

259
00:10:57,401 --> 00:10:58,489
Ah.

260
00:10:58,533 --> 00:10:59,933
And here we thought
we were special.

261
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,755
- What are you doing?
- Helping.

262
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:05,298
You said it's the end
of the world, right?

263
00:11:05,322 --> 00:11:06,410
That is right.

264
00:11:06,454 --> 00:11:07,933
I think I can hop you guys back

265
00:11:07,977 --> 00:11:10,414
a full 48 hours so you can
prevent this.

266
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,068
Oh, really? Just like that?

267
00:11:12,111 --> 00:11:14,679
Well, it's really
goddamn complicated,

268
00:11:14,723 --> 00:11:16,290
but I'm a genius.

269
00:11:17,682 --> 00:11:19,075
- Oh.
- Oh.

270
00:11:19,118 --> 00:11:21,425
Here we go.

271
00:11:24,472 --> 00:11:26,300
Are we time traveling right now?

272
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:29,607
The hell?

273
00:11:29,651 --> 00:11:31,609
What's wrong?

274
00:11:31,653 --> 00:11:34,438
Nothing's working... at all.

275
00:11:34,482 --> 00:11:35,720
Are you saying
your shit's broken?

276
00:11:35,744 --> 00:11:36,701
I hope so.

277
00:11:36,745 --> 00:11:38,007
The alternative is...

278
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:40,314
all time magic's
in some kind of lockdown.

279
00:11:40,357 --> 00:11:41,445
What could even do that?

280
00:11:41,489 --> 00:11:43,665
Something powerful...

281
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:44,666
and ancient.

282
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:46,798
You mean like the moon?

283
00:11:46,842 --> 00:11:50,324
Maybe if I just fix this
and bypass the oscillation...

284
00:11:50,367 --> 00:11:51,760
Hey, no rush, but in 30 seconds,

285
00:11:51,803 --> 00:11:53,718
we're all gonna die.

286
00:11:53,762 --> 00:11:54,806
This'll get you there.

287
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,373
Not in one piece, but...

288
00:11:56,417 --> 00:11:57,766
Wait, what?

289
00:11:59,724 --> 00:12:01,509
- Shit.
- I'm sorry.

290
00:12:01,552 --> 00:12:02,552
Oh, well.

291
00:12:07,969 --> 00:12:09,120
I cannot believe
we didn't consider

292
00:12:09,144 --> 00:12:10,537
going to Jane Chatwin first.

293
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,582
Well, she is a person
that may be upset with us.

294
00:12:12,626 --> 00:12:14,236
Yes.

295
00:12:16,325 --> 00:12:17,935
- No.
- Huh.

296
00:12:17,979 --> 00:12:19,372
Time magic's locked down,

297
00:12:19,415 --> 00:12:22,201
and the portal
to Fillory's blocked.

298
00:12:22,244 --> 00:12:25,117
This smacks of
a not-so-random coincidence.

299
00:12:27,554 --> 00:12:29,077
Okay.

300
00:12:29,121 --> 00:12:31,297
We can still get there.
Penny can't do shit.

301
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,014
What about that other
Traveller dickbucket,

302
00:12:33,038 --> 00:12:34,363
- Gavin what's-his-name?
- Everything I'm seeing

303
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,191
says the first chunk's
gonna hit around 10:00 p.m...

304
00:12:36,215 --> 00:12:39,000
We know!
12 hours.

305
00:12:39,044 --> 00:12:41,481
- We're seeing this wrong.
- We're missing something.

306
00:12:41,524 --> 00:12:44,049
Uh, maybe we need
to take a step back.

307
00:12:44,092 --> 00:12:45,920
Start thinking outside the box.

308
00:12:45,963 --> 00:12:48,836
- What do you suggest?
- Remember Professor Soto?

309
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:51,099
- Oh, the one with the pants?
- Yeah.

310
00:12:51,143 --> 00:12:52,448
He had that ridiculous test

311
00:12:52,492 --> 00:12:53,971
everyone thought was impossible.

312
00:12:54,015 --> 00:12:55,253
That we solved because we rule.

313
00:12:55,277 --> 00:12:57,192
- Solved how?
- You want me to remember

314
00:12:57,236 --> 00:12:59,020
a solution I came up with
at a rager

315
00:12:59,064 --> 00:13:01,153
doing upside-down shots
in a fur bikini?

316
00:13:01,196 --> 00:13:02,980
You say rager,

317
00:13:03,024 --> 00:13:05,331
I say problem-solving session.

318
00:13:05,374 --> 00:13:08,508
That's how we do: we put our
minds on something different

319
00:13:08,551 --> 00:13:11,163
and we catch the solution out
of the corner of our eye.

320
00:13:11,206 --> 00:13:12,338
So is this actually a plan

321
00:13:12,381 --> 00:13:13,532
or do you just wanna
blow off steam?

322
00:13:13,556 --> 00:13:15,341
Two birds, Bambi.

323
00:13:15,384 --> 00:13:18,344
Besides, we're stuck in a game
that keeps hitting reset.

324
00:13:18,387 --> 00:13:21,521
Infinite time,
zero consequences.

325
00:13:21,564 --> 00:13:23,305
Just you and me saving the world

326
00:13:23,349 --> 00:13:24,915
through unbridled hedonism.

327
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,310
Mm, fun.
Let's do it.

328
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,923
Eliot.

329
00:13:34,403 --> 00:13:35,491
Hey.

330
00:13:35,535 --> 00:13:37,058
Uh, hey.

331
00:13:37,102 --> 00:13:38,383
Did someone just knock
on the door?

332
00:13:38,407 --> 00:13:40,061
We going?

333
00:13:42,107 --> 00:13:43,108
Yeah.

334
00:13:45,588 --> 00:13:48,374
Okay, miscreants.

335
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:51,272
It's Armageddon.
So die as you lived...

336
00:13:51,315 --> 00:13:52,578
Boring.

337
00:13:52,621 --> 00:13:53,990
Or join us in an
end-of-the-world soiree

338
00:13:54,014 --> 00:13:55,581
and die legends.

339
00:13:55,624 --> 00:13:56,582
Your choice.

340
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:58,671
You heard the man.

341
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:01,978
Come on!

342
00:14:04,024 --> 00:14:05,504
It's a tie!

343
00:14:05,547 --> 00:14:06,983
Anything?

344
00:14:07,027 --> 00:14:08,768
Not yet!

345
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:12,379
Oh!

346
00:14:24,827 --> 00:14:26,089
♪ Gimme your control

347
00:14:27,613 --> 00:14:28,788
Mmm.

348
00:14:28,831 --> 00:14:29,831
Eliot!

349
00:14:33,532 --> 00:14:35,969
- El, El.
- You look like you saw a ghost.

350
00:14:36,012 --> 00:14:38,449
Hey, ask it
how we stop the moon.

351
00:14:38,493 --> 00:14:39,949
- Actually, I think I might...
- Wait!

352
00:14:39,973 --> 00:14:42,584
Oh, my God,
I think I got something.

353
00:14:42,628 --> 00:14:44,499
An idea.

354
00:14:44,543 --> 00:14:45,543
Hit me.

355
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:48,982
Cock and balls, I forgot.

356
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:05,694
This isn't working.

357
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,609
No offense, Rajit.

358
00:15:07,653 --> 00:15:08,653
It's Todd.

359
00:15:09,655 --> 00:15:10,656
No.

360
00:15:10,699 --> 00:15:12,048
Come back when you're Rajit.

361
00:15:12,092 --> 00:15:14,616
Okay.

362
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,009
You know, I've been thinking...

363
00:15:16,052 --> 00:15:17,932
clearly we need something
a little bit stronger.

364
00:15:17,967 --> 00:15:19,534
No, we need an idea.

365
00:15:19,578 --> 00:15:20,796
You know what?

366
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,146
I'm gonna go hydrate
and, I don't know...

367
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,975
stare at moon chunks hurtling
straight for Earth.

368
00:15:26,019 --> 00:15:27,760
Can't be worse than discovering

369
00:15:27,803 --> 00:15:30,414
I just jacked Todd off
for three time loops in a row.

370
00:15:33,983 --> 00:15:36,769
Eliot.

371
00:15:37,987 --> 00:15:39,554
No...

372
00:15:39,598 --> 00:15:42,688
It's never happening.

373
00:15:42,731 --> 00:15:45,647
Leave me alone.

374
00:15:47,606 --> 00:15:50,783
♪ I never, never, never,
get so close ♪

375
00:15:50,826 --> 00:15:53,133
♪ It's under control

376
00:15:53,176 --> 00:15:56,527
♪ I'm reachin'
the end of a hallway ♪

377
00:15:56,571 --> 00:15:58,529
♪ I never, never, never

378
00:15:58,573 --> 00:16:01,141
♪ Been so out my body

379
00:16:12,152 --> 00:16:15,895
I can walk away
from you all fucking day!

380
00:16:17,897 --> 00:16:20,421
Pardon me, Brenda.
I'm gonna get this.

381
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,607
I got a lead.

382
00:16:32,651 --> 00:16:34,696
I've been talking
to this weird oceanographer guy

383
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,219
who no joke has a dolphin harem,

384
00:16:36,263 --> 00:16:39,701
but he also knows
some real shit about...

385
00:16:39,745 --> 00:16:41,529
Hey, what's up with you?

386
00:16:41,572 --> 00:16:42,704
What's up?

387
00:16:42,748 --> 00:16:44,706
Is...

388
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,710
my brain is a snake
eating its tail,

389
00:16:48,754 --> 00:16:51,234
and the tail is another snake
eating its tail.

390
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:53,584
- Jesus.
- Okay, you stay here.

391
00:16:53,628 --> 00:16:56,065
I'll report back
with some research.

392
00:17:08,121 --> 00:17:10,601
I figured it out, El.

393
00:17:10,645 --> 00:17:13,648
From talking
to that dolphin fucker.

394
00:17:13,692 --> 00:17:16,172
Everything he said checked out.

395
00:17:16,216 --> 00:17:19,567
We need to go to Fisher Beach.
It's kind of out of the way.

396
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,961
Lifeguard station 17.

397
00:17:23,571 --> 00:17:24,809
Everything I'm seeing says
the first chunk's

398
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:26,574
gonna hit around 10:00 p.m...
Eliot.

399
00:17:26,617 --> 00:17:28,968
- We have 12 hours.
- Hey.

400
00:17:29,011 --> 00:17:31,187
I got the answer.
You can take a breather.

401
00:17:31,231 --> 00:17:33,276
Not right now, Margo.

402
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,278
Okay, "Leaving Las Vegas."

403
00:17:35,322 --> 00:17:36,889
I was happy to give you space

404
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:39,021
to tell your Monster secrets
in your own time,

405
00:17:39,065 --> 00:17:41,981
but we're stuck
in the Jean Paul Sarte bullshit

406
00:17:42,024 --> 00:17:43,634
and you're getting worse fast.

407
00:17:43,678 --> 00:17:45,612
I told you, this isn't
important right now, okay?

408
00:17:45,636 --> 00:17:46,855
Whatever it is,

409
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,683
you remember
it's not your fault, okay?

410
00:17:48,727 --> 00:17:50,685
This math is
so damn frustrating.

411
00:17:50,729 --> 00:17:52,861
Can we just stop
the moon first, please?

412
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,825
Not if your liver
falls out of your twat first.

413
00:17:54,863 --> 00:17:56,125
Let's talk about it.

414
00:17:56,169 --> 00:17:57,257
No.

415
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,651
- Seems like we have to.
- It's me.

416
00:18:00,695 --> 00:18:01,740
Don't be a coward.

417
00:18:01,783 --> 00:18:03,263
Stop.

418
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,659
It's still in me, okay?

419
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:16,319
I am seeing what I am seeing.

420
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:18,147
Some pieces of him
must've held on.

421
00:18:18,191 --> 00:18:20,019
The Monster is gone.

422
00:18:20,062 --> 00:18:22,848
I exorcised it
and Q threw it into the Seam.

423
00:18:22,891 --> 00:18:24,937
The only thing here
is you medicating

424
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,201
instead of facing
your memories and your feelings

425
00:18:28,244 --> 00:18:30,769
and I empathize, I do.

426
00:18:30,812 --> 00:18:33,772
But I think you're forgetting
you can tell me anything.

427
00:18:33,815 --> 00:18:37,819
I just told you,
and you didn't believe me.

428
00:18:37,863 --> 00:18:39,560
I love you.

429
00:18:39,603 --> 00:18:41,257
Even when you're nuts.

430
00:18:41,301 --> 00:18:43,303
But our window's 12 hours
to stop the moon

431
00:18:43,346 --> 00:18:45,044
or it's game over again,

432
00:18:45,087 --> 00:18:47,873
and I need it to be fixed
before I go as nuts as you,

433
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,570
so just sit this round out...

434
00:18:49,613 --> 00:18:50,919
- No.
- And I'll go alone.

435
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,268
- No, no, no.
- Please, please.

436
00:18:52,312 --> 00:18:53,704
I can...

437
00:18:53,748 --> 00:18:55,141
You can't.

438
00:18:55,184 --> 00:18:56,814
Keep it together,
I can keep it together.

439
00:18:56,838 --> 00:18:58,598
- See you yesterday.
- I can keep it together.

440
00:18:58,622 --> 00:19:00,929
Please.
No, Margo.

441
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:33,701
I'm feeling the wrong kind
of boned right now.

442
00:19:33,744 --> 00:19:35,355
Okay.

443
00:19:35,398 --> 00:19:37,270
I'm sorry.

444
00:19:37,313 --> 00:19:39,141
What you said yesterday...

445
00:19:39,185 --> 00:19:40,882
Yesterday at Westbrook's house?

446
00:19:47,323 --> 00:19:50,109
Yesterday before you went
to Fisher Beach.

447
00:19:50,152 --> 00:19:53,286
I didn't go to Fisher Beach.

448
00:19:53,329 --> 00:19:55,941
- You don't...
- At around 10 p.m.

449
00:19:55,984 --> 00:19:58,639
- We have 12 hours.
- You don't remember.

450
00:19:58,682 --> 00:20:00,119
Remember that tit-chafe Marina

451
00:20:00,162 --> 00:20:02,382
showed up and broke the moon?
How could I forget?

452
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,823
Did Josh just sneeze
on the pizza?

453
00:20:16,276 --> 00:20:17,799
So let's release that ache,

454
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:20,324
that desire for control.

455
00:20:20,367 --> 00:20:25,528
Understand the moment we're in.
Accept our state of being.

456
00:20:25,577 --> 00:20:27,448
Take a breath.

457
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:30,626
Send a prayer up to the god
of your understanding.

458
00:20:30,669 --> 00:20:33,759
Send a prayer and accept.
Amen.

459
00:20:33,803 --> 00:20:36,457
- Amen,
- Thank you.

460
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:40,505
You've momentarily lessened
my existential dread.

461
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,512
This may be the end.

462
00:20:47,556 --> 00:20:50,384
No, I'm not reading this.

463
00:20:50,428 --> 00:20:52,648
Okay, asshole.

464
00:20:52,691 --> 00:20:54,388
Bring it.

465
00:20:54,432 --> 00:20:56,521
I just wanna say...

466
00:20:57,783 --> 00:21:02,396
This world is flawed.

467
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,791
We each have good in us...
and bad.

468
00:21:05,835 --> 00:21:08,620
Every day we fight
to let the good win.

469
00:21:08,664 --> 00:21:11,492
This... this is the last day.

470
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:13,407
Think about those who you love.

471
00:21:13,451 --> 00:21:15,801
Turn off the TV
and be with them.

472
00:21:15,845 --> 00:21:16,845
Thank you and good...

473
00:21:20,066 --> 00:21:21,502
I'm sorry.

474
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:23,504
Were you listening to that?

475
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:25,942
It was so depressing.

476
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:27,639
Not really.

477
00:21:27,683 --> 00:21:29,554
Hey, you okay?

478
00:21:29,598 --> 00:21:30,555
Not really.

479
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:32,644
Me neither.

480
00:21:32,688 --> 00:21:35,342
Cookie?

481
00:21:35,386 --> 00:21:36,648
Yeah.

482
00:21:39,042 --> 00:21:41,000
I have to admit...

483
00:21:41,044 --> 00:21:42,828
I don't think their spell
will work.

484
00:21:42,872 --> 00:21:45,788
It won't.

485
00:21:45,831 --> 00:21:48,704
Can't believe I'm about to die.

486
00:21:48,747 --> 00:21:51,707
You are, but...

487
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,971
then you'll just
start all over again.

488
00:21:57,103 --> 00:21:59,366
We're in a time loop.

489
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:00,977
Shut up.

490
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,544
Seriously?

491
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:04,850
That's a relief.

492
00:22:04,894 --> 00:22:07,853
Like, uh, "Groundhog Day"?

493
00:22:07,897 --> 00:22:09,420
Or "Russian Doll"?

494
00:22:09,463 --> 00:22:11,988
Or "Happy Death Day"
or "Happy Death Day 2U"?

495
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:13,076
Or "Source Code"?

496
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:15,687
Oh, that "X-Files".
The "Star Trek".

497
00:22:15,731 --> 00:22:17,994
"Edge of Tomorrow" but really
"All You Need Is Kill"

498
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:20,866
and it's, like, why change
the title like that, right?

499
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,433
Wow.

500
00:22:22,476 --> 00:22:24,783
You really love
time loop stories, don't you?

501
00:22:24,827 --> 00:22:26,437
And you're awake in the loop.

502
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,787
You're the hero.
I am totally jealous.

503
00:22:32,922 --> 00:22:35,576
Hey, you wanna get out of here?

504
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,491
I've got this place
on my bucket list

505
00:22:37,535 --> 00:22:39,972
and well, uh...
it's gotta be now.

506
00:22:40,016 --> 00:22:43,106
- And to Sharon Cappanelli
from ninth grade: I lied.

507
00:22:43,149 --> 00:22:44,934
- Man.
- It was my tampon,

508
00:22:44,977 --> 00:22:47,153
- and that was your girlfriend.
- Time loops.

509
00:22:47,197 --> 00:22:49,025
Gnarly.

510
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:51,462
Extremely gnarly.

511
00:22:51,505 --> 00:22:52,744
So you're talking
to me about it.

512
00:22:52,768 --> 00:22:55,596
Yeah.

513
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:59,035
As opposed
to Alice, Julia, or Kady.

514
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:01,124
Or, to state the obvious,

515
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:02,734
Margo.

516
00:23:02,778 --> 00:23:05,737
I kind of blew it
beyond repair with Margo.

517
00:23:05,781 --> 00:23:07,173
How is anything beyond repair

518
00:23:07,217 --> 00:23:10,220
when you're stuck
in a time loop?

519
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,743
Well,

520
00:23:11,787 --> 00:23:14,528
she was awake with me
for a while and then

521
00:23:14,572 --> 00:23:19,098
she got kicked out somehow,
and now I am utterly alone.

522
00:23:19,142 --> 00:23:21,144
Well, if I'm learning anything

523
00:23:21,187 --> 00:23:23,755
from these squishy pierogi tacos

524
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:25,539
is that not everything
belongs together.

525
00:23:28,151 --> 00:23:29,935
How can we help?

526
00:23:29,979 --> 00:23:32,068
Help save the world?

527
00:23:33,112 --> 00:23:35,941
Honestly, I don't know.

528
00:23:35,985 --> 00:23:38,988
It might not be possible.

529
00:23:39,031 --> 00:23:41,512
This might be it.

530
00:23:41,555 --> 00:23:46,125
Me, alone,
in this particular 12 hours.

531
00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:47,910
Eternally.

532
00:23:47,953 --> 00:23:49,128
Okay.

533
00:23:49,172 --> 00:23:51,957
Sounds like a lot for you.

534
00:23:52,001 --> 00:23:55,961
So, uh, anything I can do
to help you?

535
00:23:56,005 --> 00:23:58,485
I wish.

536
00:23:58,529 --> 00:24:00,836
Because the longer this goes
on, the more certain I am

537
00:24:00,879 --> 00:24:03,795
that the Monster is inside
of me and trying to get out.

538
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:06,276
Good metaphor.

539
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,973
I'm being literal.

540
00:24:08,017 --> 00:24:09,801
Oh.

541
00:24:09,845 --> 00:24:10,845
Shit.

542
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,023
It's worse every loop.

543
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:16,590
I hear its voice,

544
00:24:16,634 --> 00:24:18,767
I see blood on the walls,

545
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:21,857
I... I see this door.

546
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,989
It wants out.

547
00:24:24,033 --> 00:24:25,817
Have you tried letting it out?

548
00:24:25,861 --> 00:24:27,819
Why in God's name
would I do that?

549
00:24:27,863 --> 00:24:29,255
I... I... I'm just spitballing.

550
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:32,128
A lot of the time
in these movies

551
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:33,999
the solution of the problem

552
00:24:34,043 --> 00:24:37,742
is facing the thing
you're most afraid of.

553
00:24:37,786 --> 00:24:40,571
What if I die?

554
00:24:40,614 --> 00:24:41,920
What if you do?

555
00:24:49,928 --> 00:24:52,278
Why?!

556
00:24:52,322 --> 00:24:54,803
Anyway.

557
00:24:54,846 --> 00:24:57,022
You're not upset
you're about to die?

558
00:25:00,069 --> 00:25:03,202
I don't love it.

559
00:25:03,246 --> 00:25:05,596
But you'll figure out a way
to fix this.

560
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:14,866
The world's greatest minds

561
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:16,061
are locked in a desperate race
to save humanity.

562
00:25:16,085 --> 00:25:17,695
Everything I'm seeing says

563
00:25:17,738 --> 00:25:19,194
the first chunk's gotta hit
around 10 p.m.

564
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:21,786
We have 12 hours.

565
00:25:23,701 --> 00:25:25,679
What if we create a massive
portal in the atmosphere?

566
00:25:25,703 --> 00:25:26,922
We'd need a specialist.

567
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:29,288
Charlton?

568
00:26:29,332 --> 00:26:30,420
Well, fuck!

569
00:26:37,244 --> 00:26:39,420
How the hell are you here?

570
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:42,205
I was trapped
wandering your Remembrances

571
00:26:42,249 --> 00:26:45,121
when mercifully you decided
not to sleep for five days

572
00:26:45,165 --> 00:26:46,645
and broke your brain.

573
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:49,299
That gave me an opening
to contact you.

574
00:26:49,343 --> 00:26:51,171
That voice?

575
00:26:51,214 --> 00:26:52,520
That was you?

576
00:26:52,564 --> 00:26:54,304
Yes, of course.

577
00:26:54,348 --> 00:26:56,176
When all the scary creatures
were pulled out,

578
00:26:56,219 --> 00:26:58,396
I held on tight as I could
in your Happy Place,

579
00:26:58,439 --> 00:27:01,094
and, well... here we are.

580
00:27:02,356 --> 00:27:04,576
This place was so vivid
in your mind,

581
00:27:04,619 --> 00:27:07,666
but there is nothing
like the real thing, is there?

582
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:11,452
The sights, the sounds, the...

583
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:12,627
smells!

584
00:27:12,671 --> 00:27:16,414
Oh, I forgot about smells,
Eliot.

585
00:27:16,457 --> 00:27:18,285
They're overwhelmingly
unpleasant.

586
00:27:18,328 --> 00:27:21,375
- Those messages?
- That was you, too?

587
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:24,509
"I'm still here"?
"Let me out"?

588
00:27:24,552 --> 00:27:25,597
Yes.

589
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,381
I wanted you to know

590
00:27:27,425 --> 00:27:28,837
that I was still here
and I wanted to be let out.

591
00:27:28,861 --> 00:27:31,516
In red paint?

592
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:33,692
Right, like strawberries
and Santa Claus.

593
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,433
And blood, Charlton.

594
00:27:35,476 --> 00:27:37,130
Well, perhaps
it was a touch ominous.

595
00:27:37,173 --> 00:27:38,566
As was the creepy whisper.

596
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:39,674
I was trying to be polite.

597
00:27:39,698 --> 00:27:40,742
Well...

598
00:27:43,571 --> 00:27:46,400
It is nice to have a
non-imaginary imaginary friend

599
00:27:46,444 --> 00:27:47,793
for the end of the world,
I guess.

600
00:27:47,836 --> 00:27:49,229
Half-imaginary.

601
00:27:49,272 --> 00:27:52,232
I was passenger
in your unconscious.

602
00:27:52,275 --> 00:27:56,497
Now, I'm still in your head.

603
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:58,543
But the conscious part?

604
00:27:58,586 --> 00:28:01,720
I can't tell you how much
of an improvement this is.

605
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,548
Your Happy Place is nice

606
00:28:03,591 --> 00:28:06,376
and I was able to see
everything you were doing here,

607
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,335
but...

608
00:28:08,378 --> 00:28:11,338
well, there's no substitute
for being heard.

609
00:28:11,381 --> 00:28:13,272
Especially since I often
disagree with your choices,

610
00:28:13,296 --> 00:28:14,733
and I'd like
to share my opinions.

611
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,561
Oh, that's peachy.

612
00:28:16,604 --> 00:28:18,301
Well, let's start now.

613
00:28:20,303 --> 00:28:23,263
Opinion on what to do next?

614
00:28:23,306 --> 00:28:25,134
Oh, well, I'd think
that's obvious.

615
00:28:25,178 --> 00:28:27,180
Is it?

616
00:28:27,223 --> 00:28:28,660
In case you didn't notice,

617
00:28:28,703 --> 00:28:30,768
Margo was sort of driving
the bus on this whole thing

618
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,490
before I screwed up
and lost her.

619
00:28:32,533 --> 00:28:34,753
You didn't lose her, Eliot.

620
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,624
She's out of the loops,
Charlton.

621
00:28:36,668 --> 00:28:39,888
No, I simply mean
I don't think that's about you.

622
00:28:39,932 --> 00:28:43,762
I think she got too close
to the answer.

623
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,459
Perhaps that's why

624
00:28:45,503 --> 00:28:49,158
she was thrown from
your shared loop experience.

625
00:28:49,202 --> 00:28:51,813
That does have
the ring of logic to it.

626
00:28:51,857 --> 00:28:53,902
Margo mentioned a beach,
did she not?

627
00:28:53,946 --> 00:28:56,383
Fisher Beach.

628
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,735
Okay.

629
00:29:00,779 --> 00:29:02,215
Let's go.

630
00:29:02,258 --> 00:29:04,913
Why is there no one here?

631
00:29:04,957 --> 00:29:06,480
I think it's a

632
00:29:06,524 --> 00:29:09,135
cancel-your-beach-trip
kind of day today.

633
00:29:09,178 --> 00:29:10,615
Psst... keep your eyes peeled

634
00:29:10,658 --> 00:29:13,661
for anyone or anything
who might not want us here.

635
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:20,363
Is that phone wire?

636
00:29:25,586 --> 00:29:27,849
Are phones generally used
underwater?

637
00:29:33,376 --> 00:29:35,335
I think we got a lead.

638
00:29:35,378 --> 00:29:36,945
Lifeguard station 17.

639
00:29:36,989 --> 00:29:38,381
That's the same track
Margo was on.

640
00:29:38,425 --> 00:29:39,861
This didn't go well for her,

641
00:29:39,905 --> 00:29:41,535
so perhaps we should discuss
before going in there, okay?

642
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:43,430
Ovary up, Charlton.

643
00:29:53,571 --> 00:29:56,661
Uh...

644
00:29:56,704 --> 00:29:57,836
I guess...

645
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:00,839
off and whales?

646
00:30:02,014 --> 00:30:04,538
What is the
purpose of this distraction?

647
00:30:04,582 --> 00:30:06,845
With whom are we speaking?

648
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,890
We are the whales.

649
00:30:08,934 --> 00:30:11,501
Like...

650
00:30:11,545 --> 00:30:12,981
all of them?

651
00:30:13,025 --> 00:30:14,722
Of course.

652
00:30:14,766 --> 00:30:17,290
Why do you speak through a TV?

653
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:18,683
Why do you?

654
00:30:18,726 --> 00:30:20,293
What is the nature
of your query?

655
00:30:20,336 --> 00:30:22,774
Okay, I don't really know
how to explain this.

656
00:30:22,817 --> 00:30:24,645
Um...

657
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:26,778
okay, so you probably don't
know this but we...

658
00:30:26,821 --> 00:30:28,649
we are in a time loop.

659
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:30,869
We are aware of the disturbance.

660
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,784
Oh, huh.

661
00:30:32,827 --> 00:30:35,003
Whales grok time loops.

662
00:30:36,004 --> 00:30:37,876
So do you happen to remember

663
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,965
if a woman named Margo
came to see you?

664
00:30:40,008 --> 00:30:43,533
Uh, brilliant, about yea high,
maybe a little brusque.

665
00:30:43,577 --> 00:30:45,448
A contemptuous creature.

666
00:30:45,492 --> 00:30:47,973
We were compelled to wash away
her temporal immunity.

667
00:30:48,016 --> 00:30:51,585
You took her Permanence off.

668
00:30:51,629 --> 00:30:52,891
Why?

669
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,850
Her manner was appalling.

670
00:30:55,894 --> 00:30:58,287
That...

671
00:30:58,331 --> 00:31:00,681
does sound like Margo, okay.

672
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:03,553
I apologize for her bedside
manner, and I just...

673
00:31:03,597 --> 00:31:07,645
I humbly and I respectfully
ask, do you...

674
00:31:07,688 --> 00:31:10,822
do you have any insight
into this loop that we're in?

675
00:31:10,865 --> 00:31:12,824
Our magic caused it.

676
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:15,957
You're... magicians?

677
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:20,919
- Pay attention!
- We will explain once.

678
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,661
Our ancestors made a pact
with the Old Gods

679
00:31:23,704 --> 00:31:25,314
and so we spend our lives

680
00:31:25,358 --> 00:31:27,447
tracing sigils
into the ocean floor.

681
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:29,971
This task is crucial.

682
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:33,453
Why?

683
00:31:33,496 --> 00:31:37,587
To ensure the Kraken
stays dormant.

684
00:31:37,631 --> 00:31:39,372
Like the...

685
00:31:39,415 --> 00:31:40,634
the Kraken-kraken?

686
00:31:40,678 --> 00:31:42,418
What's a Kraken-kraken?

687
00:31:42,462 --> 00:31:43,898
Should the Kraken ever awaken

688
00:31:43,942 --> 00:31:46,945
it would soon consume the world.

689
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,774
Okay, got it.

690
00:31:49,817 --> 00:31:52,341
So, the loops.
Why?

691
00:31:52,385 --> 00:31:53,778
The moon colliding with Earth

692
00:31:53,821 --> 00:31:55,649
obliterated
our protective sigils

693
00:31:55,693 --> 00:31:57,738
causing the Kraken to rise.

694
00:31:59,784 --> 00:32:01,350
Kinda seems like a hat on a hat

695
00:32:01,394 --> 00:32:02,893
when you've already
got a moon apocalypse.

696
00:32:02,917 --> 00:32:04,440
A bit flippant for a creature

697
00:32:04,484 --> 00:32:07,530
who caused said apocalypse.

698
00:32:07,574 --> 00:32:10,403
Fortunately, our ancestors
implemented a failsafe.

699
00:32:10,446 --> 00:32:13,014
If the Kraken awakens,
it sends Earth back 12 hours

700
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:16,801
to allow another chance
to avert catastrophe.

701
00:32:16,844 --> 00:32:19,412
Whereupon it'll
all just keep happening

702
00:32:19,455 --> 00:32:21,588
because the fucking moon
is broken.

703
00:32:21,631 --> 00:32:23,503
So it would seem.

704
00:32:23,546 --> 00:32:25,766
Well... uh... well,
if you're... if you're magicians,

705
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,638
then maybe you can help
fix the moon?

706
00:32:28,682 --> 00:32:29,814
We cannot.

707
00:32:29,857 --> 00:32:31,772
We must maintain our sigils.

708
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:33,426
Okay.

709
00:32:33,469 --> 00:32:36,821
If you don't fix the moon,
the Kraken's just...

710
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,692
just gonna keep krakening.

711
00:32:38,736 --> 00:32:40,694
This distraction
has gone on too long.

712
00:32:40,738 --> 00:32:41,956
Wait... no, no, no.

713
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,566
We must attend to the sigils.

714
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:44,567
- Hold on.
- Do not contact us again.

715
00:32:44,611 --> 00:32:45,655
No, no, no, no, no.

716
00:32:45,699 --> 00:32:46,874
No!

717
00:32:46,918 --> 00:32:49,747
Uh...

718
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:50,878
oh, shit.

719
00:32:55,646 --> 00:32:58,866
Feeling the wrong kind
of boned right now.

720
00:32:59,674 --> 00:33:01,415
Oh, okay.

721
00:33:01,458 --> 00:33:05,419
Bye, I guess.

722
00:33:07,508 --> 00:33:09,379
What am I supposed to do?

723
00:33:09,423 --> 00:33:11,468
I can't fix the moon.
That won't work.

724
00:33:11,512 --> 00:33:14,341
You can't help,
you're non-corporeal.

725
00:33:14,384 --> 00:33:15,690
True.

726
00:33:19,041 --> 00:33:21,652
But...

727
00:33:21,696 --> 00:33:23,524
you're not alone.

728
00:33:26,701 --> 00:33:30,182
So whales really are
powerful magicians.

729
00:33:30,226 --> 00:33:32,184
I knew they did weird stuff
on the ocean floor,

730
00:33:32,228 --> 00:33:33,185
I just didn't realize it was...

731
00:33:33,229 --> 00:33:34,448
- Wait.
- Yes, Alice...

732
00:33:34,491 --> 00:33:36,101
tell me what else
you know about whales.

733
00:33:36,145 --> 00:33:37,799
Um...

734
00:33:37,842 --> 00:33:39,670
their closest cousin
is the hippo.

735
00:33:39,714 --> 00:33:42,369
Um, their mating season
is in the fall.

736
00:33:42,412 --> 00:33:43,761
That is so sad for them.

737
00:33:43,805 --> 00:33:45,435
What if they never get
to make love again?

738
00:33:45,459 --> 00:33:46,808
Though I am one to talk.

739
00:33:46,851 --> 00:33:48,220
I mean, it's been
over a thousand years.

740
00:33:48,244 --> 00:33:49,637
That's not exactly
what I needed.

741
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,595
Well, you asked me what I knew.

742
00:33:51,639 --> 00:33:53,423
Is there any info
about the Kraken

743
00:33:53,467 --> 00:33:55,077
that might point us
in a direction?

744
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,644
- Whoa-ho-ho!
- Okay.

745
00:33:56,687 --> 00:34:01,257
Well, you have your
Lovecraftian god-Krakens.

746
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,780
Uh, and then there's the

747
00:34:02,824 --> 00:34:05,217
D&D Kraken
which is sort of six-of-one.

748
00:34:05,261 --> 00:34:08,438
And then, of course,
there's "Clash of the Titans",

749
00:34:08,482 --> 00:34:09,787
both the original

750
00:34:09,831 --> 00:34:10,851
- and the remake.
- Thank you.

751
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:12,703
With the very famous line...

752
00:34:12,747 --> 00:34:14,226
Thank you, Josh.

753
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:16,794
Every time the Kraken awakens,

754
00:34:16,838 --> 00:34:18,448
time jumps back 12 hours.

755
00:34:18,492 --> 00:34:19,730
Which would be great
if it took us back

756
00:34:19,754 --> 00:34:21,408
to before the moon broke.

757
00:34:22,321 --> 00:34:24,149
What if we

758
00:34:24,193 --> 00:34:27,152
get the time loop spell to
trigger a couple hours early?

759
00:34:27,196 --> 00:34:29,416
Why don't we
just kill all the damn whales?

760
00:34:29,459 --> 00:34:31,548
Well, that's clearly
what you tried to do

761
00:34:31,592 --> 00:34:33,202
when they took away
your Permanence.

762
00:34:33,245 --> 00:34:35,247
But she's right.

763
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:38,337
Maybe we need to let out
the thing that scares us.

764
00:34:38,381 --> 00:34:40,862
Maybe we need to, uh, to...

765
00:34:40,905 --> 00:34:42,254
Release the Kraken!

766
00:34:42,298 --> 00:34:44,561
Exactly, yeah.

767
00:34:44,605 --> 00:34:46,171
But earlier.

768
00:34:46,215 --> 00:34:49,871
Early... early enough
to a time before the heist.

769
00:34:49,914 --> 00:34:51,742
Shit, we're almost out of time.

770
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:58,445
Look, if the whales
have the power

771
00:34:58,488 --> 00:35:01,578
to take away your Permanence,
this could be your last shot.

772
00:35:01,622 --> 00:35:04,755
No presh,
but you're our only hope.

773
00:35:07,758 --> 00:35:09,717
I will do my very best.

774
00:35:20,554 --> 00:35:22,512
Surely, you jest.

775
00:35:22,556 --> 00:35:24,601
I know, I know.

776
00:35:24,645 --> 00:35:27,299
It goes against everything
you've ever believed in,

777
00:35:27,343 --> 00:35:28,562
and I fully respect that,

778
00:35:28,605 --> 00:35:30,477
but the only way to fix this

779
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:34,219
is to release the Kraken
right now.

780
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,874
Well, I don't think
they liked that.

781
00:35:36,918 --> 00:35:38,310
- What?
- No.

782
00:35:38,354 --> 00:35:39,790
Damn it!

783
00:35:39,834 --> 00:35:41,749
Eliot?

784
00:35:41,792 --> 00:35:43,490
Please be careful.

785
00:35:43,533 --> 00:35:45,317
Uh, you don't know
what they will do.

786
00:35:45,361 --> 00:35:46,405
Hey!

787
00:35:48,364 --> 00:35:49,626
You know I'm right!

788
00:35:50,845 --> 00:35:53,500
I know you're listening.

789
00:35:53,543 --> 00:35:56,198
You know, I have it
on good authority

790
00:35:56,241 --> 00:35:59,375
that mating season
is in the fall.

791
00:35:59,418 --> 00:36:00,811
Do you never wanna fuck again?

792
00:36:00,855 --> 00:36:02,509
Eliot, that was too personal.

793
00:36:02,552 --> 00:36:03,814
Uh...

794
00:36:03,858 --> 00:36:05,816
okay, uh, sorry.

795
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:08,950
Look, I get it.

796
00:36:08,993 --> 00:36:10,952
Look, I get it...
your ancestors made a deal,

797
00:36:10,995 --> 00:36:13,476
but special circumstances, okay?

798
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,913
Just let it out for 30 seconds.

799
00:36:15,957 --> 00:36:18,916
I will fix this
and then, you know, uh,

800
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,702
the Kraken will be back
in its safe little sea bed

801
00:36:21,745 --> 00:36:25,880
and, uh, you can maintain your
sigils for all of eternity.

802
00:36:25,923 --> 00:36:27,882
You gotta trust me.

803
00:36:27,925 --> 00:36:30,580
Just release the goddamn Kraken.

804
00:36:30,624 --> 00:36:33,888
Please, please, please,
please, please.

805
00:36:36,847 --> 00:36:37,847
Look.

806
00:37:00,958 --> 00:37:02,220
Hi there!

807
00:37:02,264 --> 00:37:04,745
Uh...

808
00:37:04,788 --> 00:37:06,616
are you the Kraken?

809
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,792
No.

810
00:37:15,669 --> 00:37:17,235
Josh, Margo, Penny.

811
00:37:17,279 --> 00:37:18,889
You guys go inside,
loop all the cameras,

812
00:37:18,933 --> 00:37:20,587
open the side door for Natasha.

813
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,632
I'll be outside waiting
with Eliot and Alice.

814
00:37:22,676 --> 00:37:24,416
Holy shit.

815
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,375
Holy shit.

816
00:37:26,418 --> 00:37:27,942
Holy shit.

817
00:37:27,985 --> 00:37:31,598
This is before the moon broke.

818
00:37:31,641 --> 00:37:33,251
It worked.

819
00:37:33,295 --> 00:37:34,731
- Okay, break.
- Sorry.

820
00:37:38,779 --> 00:37:40,737
Um, could you just, uh...
could you...

821
00:37:40,781 --> 00:37:41,932
You're freaking out, aren't you?

822
00:37:41,956 --> 00:37:43,479
- No.
- Look, you can pull

823
00:37:43,522 --> 00:37:45,524
the ripcord now.
Get out, we'll handle this.

824
00:37:45,568 --> 00:37:47,526
Margo.

825
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:50,442
Credenza.

826
00:37:50,486 --> 00:37:52,836
Don't ask questions,
just do what you say?

827
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,751
Mm-hmm.

828
00:37:54,795 --> 00:37:56,666
Fine.

829
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,537
Okay.

830
00:37:58,581 --> 00:38:00,496
Slight change of plans.

831
00:38:03,315 --> 00:38:05,361
We are so close
to saving everyone.

832
00:38:05,404 --> 00:38:06,425
You can't take that away
from us now.

833
00:38:06,449 --> 00:38:07,928
Look, whatever it is
you're after

834
00:38:07,972 --> 00:38:09,515
what's the point
if there's no world left?

835
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:13,151
There'll still be a world,
just not as many people.

836
00:38:13,195 --> 00:38:14,544
Have you met people?

837
00:38:14,587 --> 00:38:17,808
I've met people, many people.

838
00:38:17,851 --> 00:38:19,636
How many people have you met?

839
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:22,508
Because I bet
I've met more people.

840
00:38:22,552 --> 00:38:24,945
What the fuck is wrong with you?

841
00:38:24,989 --> 00:38:26,686
Hi.

842
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:28,340
What the hell did...

843
00:38:30,299 --> 00:38:31,822
Hell, yes.

844
00:38:35,391 --> 00:38:36,914
What the... how did you...

845
00:38:36,957 --> 00:38:38,394
Julia, now.

846
00:39:02,983 --> 00:39:03,941
Hey!

847
00:39:03,984 --> 00:39:05,725
Hot pizza!

848
00:39:05,769 --> 00:39:07,988
That's one pizza
we definitely can enjoy.

849
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:10,904
All right.
Oh, nice pour right there.

850
00:39:12,515 --> 00:39:14,865
Yes, cheers, cheers, yes.

851
00:39:14,908 --> 00:39:16,475
Bam!

852
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:17,955
- All right, Emeril.
- Fresco pizza!

853
00:39:17,998 --> 00:39:20,436
Yes, cheers.

854
00:39:20,479 --> 00:39:21,524
Whoo!

855
00:39:29,749 --> 00:39:32,187
You don't want a drink?

856
00:39:34,406 --> 00:39:37,453
Actually, I desperately do not.

857
00:39:37,496 --> 00:39:38,908
- That's concerning.
- Those time loops

858
00:39:38,932 --> 00:39:40,934
must've really did
a number on you.

859
00:39:42,458 --> 00:39:43,720
So...

860
00:39:44,982 --> 00:39:48,464
You're right,
I have been pushing you away.

861
00:39:48,507 --> 00:39:51,293
Yeah, no shit.

862
00:39:51,336 --> 00:39:53,338
It's just...

863
00:39:58,778 --> 00:40:01,390
I do remember the Monster.

864
00:40:01,433 --> 00:40:05,742
It was bad and bloody and, um...

865
00:40:07,483 --> 00:40:09,789
Those memories are, like,
right here.

866
00:40:09,833 --> 00:40:12,531
And, um...

867
00:40:12,575 --> 00:40:14,664
you know, maybe I really do
need that drink.

868
00:40:14,707 --> 00:40:17,536
I don't get why you feel like
you have to go it alone.

869
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:23,977
I don't either.

870
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:25,979
My logical brain
knows without a doubt

871
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:27,720
that I'm better with you.

872
00:40:27,764 --> 00:40:29,374
Yes, and same.

873
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:37,469
Tell your coping mechanisms
to back off...

874
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:41,256
Or I'll punch 'em in the dick.

875
00:40:41,299 --> 00:40:44,433
During the loops,
we were in it together

876
00:40:44,476 --> 00:40:47,044
and then you were gone, and...

877
00:40:47,087 --> 00:40:48,872
shocking revelation...

878
00:40:48,915 --> 00:40:50,676
I am utterly miserable
when you're not around.

879
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,268
Yeah, I know.

880
00:40:53,311 --> 00:40:54,834
I don't know
if that's fair to you.

881
00:40:54,878 --> 00:40:57,837
What are you talking about?

882
00:40:57,881 --> 00:40:59,448
The other thing I learned

883
00:40:59,491 --> 00:41:02,451
being in the loops
with you for so long...

884
00:41:02,494 --> 00:41:05,454
you're not exactly
who you used to be.

885
00:41:05,497 --> 00:41:06,498
You've...

886
00:41:06,542 --> 00:41:07,891
Please don't say aged.

887
00:41:07,934 --> 00:41:11,938
You've evolved, Margo Hanson.

888
00:41:11,982 --> 00:41:13,636
You've become more
of your true self.

889
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:15,725
You've earned it.

890
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:20,991
And I don't want to ask you
to take a step back

891
00:41:21,034 --> 00:41:23,733
just so I can try and catch up.

892
00:41:23,776 --> 00:41:25,125
Oh.

893
00:41:25,169 --> 00:41:26,953
I was a mess you had
to untangle in there

894
00:41:26,997 --> 00:41:31,436
just so you could soldier on,
and... once you did,

895
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,004
you figured out
how to fix all of this.

896
00:41:34,047 --> 00:41:35,155
And then you picked up the baton

897
00:41:35,179 --> 00:41:36,746
and actually did the thing.

898
00:41:36,789 --> 00:41:39,488
- I got lucky.
- No.

899
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:47,060
It's 'cause you understand me
better than anyone.

900
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:50,020
Mm-hmm.

901
00:41:50,063 --> 00:41:51,630
So quit acting
like you're the screw-up

902
00:41:51,674 --> 00:41:53,502
and get on my level, El.

903
00:41:56,853 --> 00:41:59,029
You did it.

904
00:41:59,072 --> 00:42:00,813
You did when the world
was on the line,

905
00:42:00,857 --> 00:42:02,728
now do it for yourself.

906
00:42:11,911 --> 00:42:13,913
I don't know
if I want to get on your level

907
00:42:13,957 --> 00:42:15,785
knowing that you
jacked off Todd.

908
00:42:15,828 --> 00:42:18,570
- I did not.
- Yeah, you did.

909
00:42:19,571 --> 00:42:21,660
I did not.

910
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:28,101
The hell?

911
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:29,538
Coming.

912
00:42:31,061 --> 00:42:32,932
Oh, thank God!

913
00:42:32,976 --> 00:42:34,194
I've tried every other

914
00:42:34,238 --> 00:42:36,066
magical Penthouse
in the city and...

915
00:42:36,109 --> 00:42:38,721
- Todd.
- Wh... uh, what...

916
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:40,200
Why are you here?

917
00:42:40,244 --> 00:42:42,072
I need your help.

918
00:42:42,115 --> 00:42:43,789
Something just happened that
feels way above my pay grade,

919
00:42:43,813 --> 00:42:45,138
and you were the first
person I thought of

920
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:46,859
who could help me handle it.

921
00:42:46,903 --> 00:42:49,079
Okay, it's a weird one.
Just hear me out, okay?

922
00:42:49,122 --> 00:42:53,039
So this pig dude
who kind of looks like

923
00:42:53,083 --> 00:42:54,867
that one guy
Paul Giamatti played

924
00:42:54,911 --> 00:42:56,565
in that one show
with all the wigs

925
00:42:56,608 --> 00:42:58,218
told me I'm supposed
to do a quest.

926
00:42:58,262 --> 00:42:59,916
Seriously?

927
00:42:59,959 --> 00:43:01,874
That asshole went to you?

928
00:43:01,918 --> 00:43:03,746
Wow. Ha.

929
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:06,444
Yeah, he's extremely committed
to finding a dude.

930
00:43:06,488 --> 00:43:09,534
Yeah, it's fine, Todd.
We fixed it.

931
00:43:09,578 --> 00:43:12,668
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yes, I'm sure.

932
00:43:12,711 --> 00:43:14,887
The Harmonic Convergence
isn't happening anymore.

933
00:43:14,931 --> 00:43:16,454
The who now?

934
00:43:16,498 --> 00:43:17,977
The end of the world?

935
00:43:18,021 --> 00:43:19,544
Uh, no.

936
00:43:19,588 --> 00:43:22,852
He did say the end of something
but not that.

937
00:43:22,895 --> 00:43:24,767
He was talking about Fillory.

938
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,856
Remind me, is Fillory real?

939
00:43:28,901 --> 00:43:32,035
The end of Fillory?

940
00:43:32,078 --> 00:43:33,210
So...

941
00:43:33,253 --> 00:43:35,560
so we saved the wrong world?

942
00:43:39,651 --> 00:43:41,610
So we're not done.

943
00:43:44,569 --> 00:43:46,963
Of course.
