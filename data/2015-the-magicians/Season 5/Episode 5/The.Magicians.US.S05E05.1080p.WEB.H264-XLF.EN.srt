1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,119
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,459
There's too much magic.

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,459
Everything that I touch just...

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,055
it grows like crazy.

5
00:00:14,056 --> 00:00:15,839
I'm gonna let your bullshit slide

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,839
on account of you so
recently being possessed

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,879
by a homicidal monster.

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,339
There was a blood worm scare,

9
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,147
so the Library gave a lot
of hedges the Reed's Mark.

10
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,775
I found a spell to remove
the Marks in a Depository.

11
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:28,319
I get you're on a mission.
One of you's got to jet.

12
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,446
Either one of you can hang for eternity.

13
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,989
I've earned the right to step off.

14
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:34,909
We're here to study with Mayakovsky.

15
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,786
I hate all of you.

16
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:37,830
Professor?

17
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:39,770
_

18
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:41,999
"Best bitches."

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,044
Wear this, and you'll see what I see.

20
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:46,529
I'm Clarion, the goddess of melody.

21
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,199
The way that you're imagining
the Harmonic Convergence

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,439
isn't quite enough.

23
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,511
When all the spells cast by
all the Magicians go haywire,

24
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:56,556
you're gonna get earthquakes,
starvation, plague.

25
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,600
She didn't have time to be delicate.

26
00:00:58,601 --> 00:01:00,476
You can't travel anymore.

27
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,604
What exactly are we looking for, sir?

28
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:05,059
Not what. Who.

29
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,499
- You two know each other?
- No.

30
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,279
Well, your subjects
are rightly grateful.

31
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,329
For sending that letter?

32
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:12,655
AKA that thing I totally
didn't do; you did.

33
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:15,032
I was gonna let you die for Fillory.

34
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,784
The Convergence can be stopped.

35
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:20,809
All you have to do is move...

36
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,041
that.

37
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,479
The Harmonic Convergence.

38
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,319
- AKA the end of the world.
- Not necessarily.

39
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,779
This constellation forms a cosmic sigil

40
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,880
that increases magical intensity.

41
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:37,472
It has happened in the past
without causing an apocalypse.

42
00:01:37,473 --> 00:01:39,223
But now there's surges of magic.

43
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:42,477
So we get the disaster movie
Clarion was talking about.

44
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:45,813
The Convergence will only occur
during this perfect alignment.

45
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,559
If we move the moon out of position...

46
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,519
No Convergence, no Circumstance,

47
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,620
no apocalypse.

48
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,579
The moon is not just a rock in space.
It has certain properties.

49
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,492
- Like?
- Magic doesn't work on it.

50
00:01:57,493 --> 00:01:59,949
Thanks to Magicians
casting haphazardly on it

51
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,349
for millennia, the moon is
now covered by a crust

52
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,519
of spell debris, blocking new spells.

53
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,544
If we move any piece out
of place, no Convergence.

54
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:09,940
Well, what if we just moved Mars?

55
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:12,423
She said with a straight face.

56
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,801
The other pieces are planets.

57
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,829
We can't move them
because they are, well,

58
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,640
very big and far away.

59
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,279
The moon is the only celestial body

60
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,599
we stand a chance of affecting.

61
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,849
But won't that screw
with the Circumstances?

62
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,353
What will magic be like when we're done?

63
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:26,809
Impossible to know.

64
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,358
It will be a brand-new Circumstance.

65
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,279
But to get to that problem,
we need to solve this one.

66
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,979
Good, well, I hope you have some ideas,

67
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,198
because we're striking out.

68
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,701
I do. Consult the Lunatics.

69
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,412
- The lunatics?
- Short for "Lunar Fanatics."

70
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:45,299
In the Middle Ages,
people thought insanity

71
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,339
was caused by changing
phases of the moon.

72
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,378
In fact, it was often a Lunatic
in the throes of worship.

73
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:53,499
They claimed to be able to
achieve a magical connection

74
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,139
with the moon and even under
some circumstances...

75
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,169
move it.

76
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,679
Well, that sounds useful.

77
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,579
- Mm.
- Well, if it's just branding,

78
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,267
it means they're not
really crazy, right?

79
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,359
My dad always said that
they were batshit insane,

80
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,799
and he married my mom,
so he had a pretty high bar

81
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,919
for mental instability.

82
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,379
Regardless, they know more
about the moon than anyone.

83
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,859
I believe that talking to them
is our only chance at success.

00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,679
_

86
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,966
What people don't understand

87
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,819
is there is a skeleton of the universe,

88
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,079
but we are the bones.

89
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,399
Oh, that's good to know.

90
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,679
I am a humerus.

91
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,139
You? Patella.

92
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,679
We wanted to ask you about the moon.

93
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,279
Can we talk about it?

94
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,279
It... it?

95
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,027
Her Lunacy...

96
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,099
Identifies as she/her.

97
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,739
That's right. We knew that, right?

98
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,769
- Of course.
- We know.

99
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,663
If we wanted to move Her,
how could we do that?

100
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,149
You don't move Her.

101
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,649
Okay, listen, Reba.

102
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:15,585
In just a few days, a whole lot
of people are going to die.

103
00:04:15,586 --> 00:04:16,799
That's a whole lot people

104
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,382
that will never get to worship the moon.

105
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,959
They will never get to
know Her like you do.

106
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,689
If She can help us save
all of those lives...

107
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,259
imagine everyone that will realize

108
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,629
just how much She deserves their love,

109
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,978
their reverence.

110
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,689
So will you help us?

111
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,790
Just to be clear.

112
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,279
You don't move Her.

113
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,615
You ask Her to move.

114
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:46,035
And She won't let you speak to
Her unless you get moon brain.

115
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,912
So one of us needs moon brain.

116
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,949
Not one of you. Three of you.

117
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,699
A single Magician cannot
generate enough power

118
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,870
to reach Her.

119
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,629
So it's a cooperative spell then.

120
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,756
It is a sign of respect, Kneecap,

121
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:01,384
that allows you to see
Her as She truly is.

122
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:04,229
If you have moon brain,
then you will see Her aura.

123
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,419
Now it is red, but when you
perform the Dianic Ritual,

124
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,430
Her aura will change.

125
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,329
If it is yellow, She is considering.

126
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,679
If it is green, She is listening.

127
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,709
Only then may you ask Her

128
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,949
to move.

129
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,239
Red, yellow, green.

130
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,519
The guy who invented the stoplight,

131
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,400
was he a Lunatic too?

132
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:24,899
William Potts? Yeah.

133
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,679
Oh, cool.

134
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,119
All three Magicians
must perform the ritual

135
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,589
until the moon is listening.

136
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:35,159
A warning: once Her aura is green,
She may choose to listen

137
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,503
to anyone who calls to Her, so be ready.

138
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,004
You must choose one,
the strongest among you,

139
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:42,843
to speak to Her, like the
old Lunatics taught us to.

140
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,679
For this second part,
however, there is a price.

141
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,680
- A price, like blood?
- It is like blood to Her.

142
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,810
You will need a piece
of Her. A sacrifice.

143
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,779
A piece?

144
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,981
- Or like a moon rock?
- Yes.

145
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:59,259
But be aware,

146
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,289
this will destroy it,

147
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,989
so don't use your favorite one.

148
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:07,617
This is the price of
speaking to the moon.

149
00:06:07,618 --> 00:06:09,744
Just a few more questions.

150
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:12,999
What is moon brain,
and how do we get it?

151
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,083
- Everyone line up.
- Pudding time!

152
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,127
Lovely to speak to you.

153
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,046
You too, Kneecap.

154
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:28,540
You ever just spin a globe,
stick your finger down,

155
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,719
see where it lands?

156
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,059
It's almost always water,

157
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,379
because, well, duh.

158
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,789
Earth is mostly water, but
sometimes it's the Sahara,

159
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,649
sometimes the Urals.

160
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,652
That's what you'd be doing
if you tried to travel.

161
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:45,863
Only instead of the
globe, the multiverse,

162
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,739
which is bigger and deadlier.

163
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,239
Afraid you'd say that.

164
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,879
I looked at everything I could think of,

165
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,599
magical and medical.

166
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,582
Nada. You're grounded.

167
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,579
All right, well, since
I ain't traveling,

168
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,749
I should probably step down.

169
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,299
Uh, if you're offering your resignation,

170
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,309
I don't accept.

171
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,089
Not offering. Stating.

172
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,217
With Dean Fogg out indefinitely,

173
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:09,137
Brakebills has instituted our
Dean Vanishment Protocol.

174
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,989
Of course, that's a thing here.

175
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,329
Yeah, and uh...

176
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,851
That makes me acting Dean Lipson.

177
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,269
There's no instruction manual,

178
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,969
so I'm kinda dean-ing on the fly here,

179
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,099
but one thing I do know

180
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,499
is losing a professor who was disabled

181
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,020
on school grounds ain't happening.

182
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,579
I mean, the optics would
be pure shitflakes.

183
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,450
So your contract will be
honored and enforced.

184
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,740
Oh, also.

185
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,915
We need a new Welters coach.

186
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,789
I've been on the inside,
and I'm telling you

187
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,335
it's a goddamn goose-stepping,

188
00:07:44,336 --> 00:07:47,091
fairy-snatching, ethnic
cleansing Gestapo.

189
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:49,299
To be fair, the ethnic
cleansing happened

190
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,220
after the Dark King left, so...

191
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,181
He's innocent because he delegates?

192
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:54,719
No, that's not what I'm saying.

193
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,099
Someone in this castle ordered
the hunt on that Fairy.

194
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,439
It could have been the Dark King,

195
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,839
but if it was someone else,

196
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,647
killing Seb might just
make things worse.

197
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:06,862
So we have to find out
who before we... coup.

198
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,990
I just wanna stab someone.

199
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,289
I haven't heard you
this bloodthirsty in...

200
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,786
well, not that long,
but still, it's notable.

201
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,329
Maybe I'm a bit on edge.

202
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,207
Josh keeps wanting to talk.

203
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,399
You mean about how you wanted

204
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,499
to leave him in the past to die?

205
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,920
Yeah, that.

206
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,139
So far, I'm doing a good
job of avoiding him,

207
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,799
but eventually he's gonna sneak...

208
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,009
Guys.

209
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,579
- Hey, what's up?
- 'Sup?

210
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,009
First off, kudos on the hiding spot.

211
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,223
It took me forever to find you.

212
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:36,640
Pretty busy here, Josh.

213
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,649
You're busy?

214
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,851
I just got promoted to head chef.

215
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,049
- Oh, congratulations.
- Thank you.

216
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,979
But I'm about to bail on a state dinner

217
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,519
and leave it to my incompetent
sous-chef because...

218
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,389
Apocalypse! Now!

219
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,299
Josh, would you just give it up?

220
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,988
He keeps trying to get us
to join his film club,

221
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,698
which I told him would
never work on a planet

222
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,742
with no electricity or taste.

223
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:57,995
Uh, no, uh, sorry.
This one's just a little shy.

224
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,439
It... it's okay, buddy.

225
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,959
- Help us stop the...
- Apocalypse! Now!

226
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,260
- Oh.
- We need to get back to Earth.

227
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,839
Margo, our talk will have to wait

228
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,509
till after we save the world.

229
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,719
Oh, but then I have my
nephew's bar mitzvah.

230
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,345
So after that?

231
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,180
- Mazel.
- Thanks.

232
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:21,449
What about our thing? We have
a lot of fact-finding to do

233
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,104
before I can get to stabbing.

234
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:24,559
No problem.

235
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,273
I know just who to handle it.

236
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,025
You want me to what?

237
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:31,329
Just find out who in the
castle hates Fairies.

238
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,569
Okay? And what they're doing to them.

239
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,282
And why Fairies in the first place?

240
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:38,199
And maybe talk to some Fairies,
get their side of things.

241
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,479
- Okay.
- And while you're at it...

242
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,207
anything else that seems important.

243
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,119
Okay, okay, okay.

244
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,590
No, um... That seems like a
lot of open-ended questions.

245
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,599
- Mm-hmm.
- I got this maid job

246
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,699
to be close to you guys,

247
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,239
and now you're deserting me?

248
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,636
I want to stop an apocalypse too.

249
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,819
Every apocalypse-stopping mission

250
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,849
needs a maid on the outside.

251
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,859
It's a key staple in Earth movies.

252
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,019
Do you mean inside man?

253
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,728
'Cause that's more of
a heist movie thing.

254
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,069
- No, that's different.
- Okay.

255
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,199
Everyone knows

256
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,139
the "secret, sexy maid
on the outside" trope.

257
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,179
- Yeah?
- Josh has a film club.

258
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,409
- You should check it out.
- Huh.

259
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:18,900
Maid on the outside. Yeah.

260
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,660
So did your loony friend
say how to get moon brain?

261
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,549
From what we read, her rituals

262
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,059
are simple first-year Popper tuts.

263
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,589
But moon brain is...

264
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:33,174
the insanity you get from
extreme sleep deprivation.

265
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:35,759
Extreme, like a night partying,
or what are we talking about?

266
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,269
I wish.

267
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,846
Five nights without sleep,

268
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:41,069
and we can't use magic
to stay awake either.

269
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,434
Apparently, moon brain has
to come about naturally.

270
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,469
This is completely nuts.

271
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:48,279
Isn't the Harmonic whatever
happening in five nights?

272
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,449
Yes, so if we all start tonight,

273
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,359
we might actually have
a shot at stopping it.

274
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,469
Wait a minute.

275
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,280
Five nights without sleep is
gonna fuck us up royally.

276
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:59,283
Can we even cast if
we're that messed up?

277
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,826
Well, three of us have to.

278
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,659
Look, guys, I know it sucks,

279
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:07,359
but whoever can stay up for 132 hours

280
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,377
without sleep and not lose their shit...

281
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,546
gets to stop the apocalypse.

282
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,209
I don't know about you guys,
but I am doing great.

283
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,940
- _
- Coffee.

284
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,459
Where's our fearless leader?

285
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,059
- _
- She's taking a cold shower

286
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,089
to keep herself awake.

287
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,369
Third... fourth time this morning.

288
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,440
Well, I don't know about you guys,

289
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,609
but I am too excited to sleep.

290
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,260
I mean, we're doing it!

291
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,905
Is this, uh, helping
you find moon rocks?

292
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,379
Mm.

293
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,319
No, this is helping us stay awake.

294
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,839
The moment I research,
I'm out like a light.

295
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,870
Know what might help?

296
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,207
If we make this party a
little more '80s themed.

297
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,619
Eliot.

298
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,249
Oh, I don't think we should.

299
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,255
If we ski the fresh
powder, know what I mean?

300
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:57,383
- Yeah, I get it.
- I mean cocaine.

301
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,759
Get me cocaine.

302
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,919
- I am not getting you cocaine.
- Eliot.

303
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,719
A five-day bender would
destroy your nose,

304
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,599
and could you imagine what that would do

305
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,609
to your sense of taste?

306
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:06,979
I get a full nine every night,

307
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,079
and I'm still a bitch.
This is gonna get real.

308
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,019
Hey, guys, come check this out.

309
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,193
I found something.

310
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:18,379
NASA brought back a bunch of moon rocks

311
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,560
from the Apollo missions.

312
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,459
We're stealing from NASA? Hell, yeah.

313
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,629
Mama's checking one more
off her bucket list.

314
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,279
Okay, we're not stealing from NASA.

315
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,499
I checked, it's impossible. I'm sorry.

316
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,169
But some of the rocks
that they brought back,

317
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:31,292
they gave out as gifts,
and they went missing.

318
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:33,739
About 180.

319
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,819
The ones they did find,

320
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,409
they found 'em in garages,

321
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:39,109
desk drawers, kids' bedrooms.
Just lying around.

322
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,427
People forgot about them,
but they're out there,

323
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,012
and I definitely think we can get one.

324
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,379
Okay, you guys do that.

325
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,169
I'm gonna go get some
stay-awake supplies.

326
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:48,934
I have a muffin recipe
with a special ingredient

327
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,186
that is guaranteed to keep
us alert for five days.

328
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,938
What is it? Meth?

329
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,429
Oh, excuse you.

330
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,984
It is a organic, locally-sourced

331
00:12:56,985 --> 00:13:00,639
natural stimulant that got me
through every finals week,

332
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,860
and it is definitely not meth.

333
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:03,299
That's exactly what I would say

334
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,860
if I was trying to get us to take meth.

335
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,369
Mm-hmm.

336
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,790
You're taking retirement well.

337
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,019
I find that organization

338
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,389
helps bring a sense of stability
when one's feeling...

339
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,511
not stable.

340
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,710
Okay.

341
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,999
I need to find a Book
Depository that got moved.

342
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,352
It's in Hell's Kitchen,
that's all I know.

343
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:33,429
Library buildings are
enchanted to blend in

344
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,669
with their new environs
whenever they're relocated.

345
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,249
You'll have to go door-to-door,

346
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,109
find the building covered
in Library wards.

347
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,649
Great. Let's go.

348
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:43,239
You're abandoning your friends?

349
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,060
They have enough people
for a rock search.

350
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:48,339
Plus, whatever's in Josh's
muffins doesn't sound like

351
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,910
something a person in
recovery should be taking.

352
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,549
I need to find the Depository

353
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:54,875
before we move the moon
and screw up magic.

354
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:58,089
Right now, we have enough
to remove Reed's Marks.

355
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:00,757
After, like you said, who knows?

356
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,129
I'm not sure I'd be much use to you.

357
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,594
Out in the world.

358
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:08,389
The building's impenetrable
on a good day.

359
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:11,760
Unless you're a Librarian who
knows the security protocols.

360
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,219
I don't know...

361
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,099
I'm not asking for your help.

362
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,560
I'm giving you a chance to fix
your massive, massive mistake.

363
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,649
Mm.

364
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,479
Let's go.

365
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,258
High King Fen?

366
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,420
Fairy!

367
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:48,539
Keep the High King talk quiet.

368
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,888
I'm undercover.

369
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,763
- You will come with me.
- Oh!

370
00:14:51,764 --> 00:14:53,160
That... that is so great.

371
00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:55,309
I have a lot of questions for you.

372
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,563
Some I don't even know why I'm asking.

373
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,356
They said you would fear me.

374
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,089
Funny thing.

375
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,179
I am on a Fairy quest.

376
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:07,079
See, I'm a maid on the outside.

377
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,160
Super-secret. Super-sexy.

378
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,788
Follow me, Maid on the Outside Fen.

379
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,869
Good.

380
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,083
Okay.

381
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,341
- Guess what I found.
- You found a moon rock?

382
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,169
I found a moon rock.

383
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,119
And those muffins smell amazing.

384
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,390
- Thank you.
- Now all we have to do is stay awake.

385
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,267
You know what helps me stay awake?

386
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:38,719
- What's that?
- An open, naked conversation

387
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,273
about our relationship.

388
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,819
I wanna tell you about all
my repressed emotions.

389
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,569
One by one.

390
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,408
Oh, baby.

391
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,430
Josh.

392
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:56,140
Josh.

393
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,207
Josh!

394
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,375
Josh!

395
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:02,586
- Oh, no.
- Josh!

396
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:05,549
Oh, shit.

397
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,570
Oh, shit!

398
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,119
We leave you for one afternoon,

399
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,680
and you fuck us completely.

400
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,579
I'm sorry, guys.

401
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:19,144
I sat down for one minute
because I never fall asleep

402
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,437
when I have something in the oven.

403
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,481
Well, congratulations.

404
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:24,608
This is a milestone for you.

405
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:25,799
Hey, guys.

406
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,444
Hope you had better luck than we did.

407
00:16:27,445 --> 00:16:30,489
Nope, we portal-hopped
every lead we had.

408
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,059
The closest thing we found
was a chunk of old concrete

409
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,240
with the word "moon"
written on it in Sharpie.

410
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:36,495
Those rocks are gone.

411
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,719
But we did come home

412
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,665
to find Josh sleeping peacefully.

413
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,889
I'm going to assume your rudeness

414
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:44,212
is because sleep deprivation
makes you irritable.

415
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:46,079
Sure. Assume that.

416
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,631
Yeah, I get it.

417
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,929
I'm gonna have to staple
my eyes open; this is rough.

418
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:52,929
No one else sleeps. We have four nights.

419
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:55,379
We need one rock lead to pan out.

420
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,929
But if the spell burns them up,

421
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,819
what if we can't find any rocks

422
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,602
because the Lunatics used them all?

423
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:02,855
What if there's no more
moon rocks on Earth?

424
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,939
Just sayin',

425
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,039
we could celebrate the Harmonic
Convergence in Fillory.

426
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,320
It's a little dystopian at the mo',

427
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:12,199
but on the plus, their weekend forecast

428
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,825
doesn't call for an apocalypse.

429
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,359
Look, guys,

430
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,199
if you're looking for some
sort of inspirational speech

431
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,199
on why you should stay and fight,

432
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,460
I can't help you. It's gonna suck,

433
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:32,239
and even if we do succeed,
which we might not,

434
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,219
it's not like we're
gonna get any credit.

435
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,959
The world ends, I end with it,

436
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,929
knowing that I did everything I could,

437
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:44,146
because I won't be able to
live with myself otherwise.

438
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:45,849
Julia's right.

439
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:48,919
She really does suck at
inspirational speeches.

440
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:53,849
But also that we should save the world.

441
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:54,899
I'm with you.

442
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,450
So am I.

443
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:57,989
Me too.

444
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,328
I'm in.

445
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:01,788
And my axe!

446
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,417
Really?

447
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,627
- No?
- No.

448
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:08,819
Should've led with, "You have my bow."

449
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,835
- Mm-hmm.
- Nope.

450
00:18:09,836 --> 00:18:12,967
Josh, put some fresh meth
muffins in the oven.

451
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:14,089
Again, not meth.

452
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,307
_

453
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:25,437
Hey! No droopy eyes on my watch.

454
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,439
_

455
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,740
One more.

456
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,659
- _
- I'm good now.

457
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,669
I ain't.

458
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:35,060
Oh, well, right on cue.

459
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:38,659
I tried something new this round.

460
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:42,746
A hint of lavender and goji berry.

461
00:18:42,747 --> 00:18:44,831
How we doin', Captain?

462
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,639
Oh, you know, 12 hours
till the end of the world,

463
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,239
and it's like we're still

464
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,878
grasping for needles in a hay straw.

465
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,419
Fun. Okay.

466
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,800
Probably not the best
question for morale,

467
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,519
but as the only person here
who's slept this week,

468
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,419
we have 12 hours and zero leads.

469
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,039
Is waiting here to die
really the best option?

470
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,410
When are we gonna give
Margo's idea another think?

471
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,941
Guys, I can't trust my brain right now,

472
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:11,939
but this seems like
it could be relevant.

473
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,736
I think this guy has a moon rock.

474
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,669
Oren Westbrook. Why do I know him?

475
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:17,989
Because you're not a cave person.

476
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,679
He invented the tech for pop-up ads,

477
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,161
and he invented the tech
to block pop-up ads.

478
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,199
Ever since, he's just
been a weird rich guy

479
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,199
doing weird-rich-guy shit.

480
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,710
I heard his blood boy
has his own blood boy.

481
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:34,179
Ew, what's on his eye?

482
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,170
That's the same tattoo that Reba had.

483
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,339
Julia, I think he's a Lunatic.

484
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,379
All right.

485
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,974
So in order to save the
world, all we have to do

486
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:48,369
is convince some eccentric
billionaire with armed guards

487
00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:51,579
to give up something he
probably considers to be, like,

488
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,599
his Holy Grail.

489
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,486
All while we're so tired
we can't see straight.

490
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,979
Pshh, no sweat.

491
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,788
Marvelous.

492
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:09,083
How did you handle the pain?

493
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,159
Knowing it would bring
me closer to Her Lunacy

494
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,290
- helped me get through it.
- _

495
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:15,679
_

496
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,979
Same as when I got mine.

497
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,801
That and a handful of opiates.

498
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:26,999
Hey, sorry about the security.

499
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,079
I hope you guys understand.

500
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,629
Ah, please, you can't
let in every Lunatic.

501
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:31,855
Some people are crazy.

502
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,690
Eliot.

503
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,559
Oh, wow, you guys really look awful.

504
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,569
What?

505
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:42,579
Eliot...

506
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,059
Your sunken eyes!

507
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,828
- Let me out.
- Preparing for moon brain?

508
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:49,119
The Harmonic Convergence.

509
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,957
Mm! Yeah, baby.

510
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,542
I'm celebrating too.

511
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:55,213
I'm gonna have a few
friends over for a party.

512
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,259
Uh, El?

513
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,467
Eliot?

514
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:02,829
Eliot, you good?

515
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:05,119
- Yeah, yea... yeah.
- Yeah.

516
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,229
Just can't wait to see
this amazing moon rock.

517
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,767
Don't worry.

518
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:12,230
You both will experience Her.

519
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:28,179
What a cozy little nightmare.

520
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,859
I might need you to
punch me to stay awake.

521
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,872
Gotcha.

522
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:33,289
- Isn't She wondrous?
- Yeah, definitely.

523
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:34,334
Think we can turn on the lights

524
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:36,229
and turn off the yoga music?

525
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:39,669
You got this from the moon... how?

526
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,819
I went.

527
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,969
You just went to the moon
like it was Coney Island?

528
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,859
Yeah, actually, it was pretty tough.

529
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,979
To be honest, I was trying
to impress someone.

530
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:52,019
But in the end, our
souls did not connect.

531
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,896
Yeah, we need to ask a favor.

532
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,814
For my fellow Lunatics,
I would move Heaven and Earth.

533
00:21:57,815 --> 00:21:59,380
About that...

534
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:01,361
Yeah, look, we know this
rock is special to you...

535
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:03,864
- Super special.
- But we need it.

536
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:06,366
To move Her. Hence the moon brain.

537
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,034
You do know what that would do, right?

538
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,759
Yes, but it's a matter
of life and death.

539
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,239
We can stop the Harmonic Convergence

540
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,490
if we can hold the moon out
of position long enough.

541
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,829
- Why?
- Because it's going to cause

542
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,168
worldwide destruction.

543
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,890
Magic will become so powerful,
it'll be apocalyptic.

544
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:23,460
I mean, it's not like it's gonna
wipe out all life on Earth.

545
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:24,699
Just some.

546
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,970
You know exactly how
bad it's going to get,

547
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,160
don't you?

548
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:30,015
What, are you planning to
profit off this or something?

549
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:31,879
I'm planning to use my resources

550
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,143
to help the world recover.

551
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:34,919
Now, I'm an entrepreneurial spirit.

552
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,719
I can't help but make money.

553
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,980
Now, I do think that the moon
brain is getting to you.

554
00:22:39,984 --> 00:22:41,550
Unless...

555
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:47,570
Mm, your eye tattoo is illusion magic.

556
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:49,492
You're no Lunatic at all.

557
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,799
I'll have my guards escort you out.

558
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,609
Let's go, El. We tried.

559
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:56,820
Happens all the time.

560
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,802
- Get it?
- All of it.

561
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,053
We have a problem.

562
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,399
So it's just security cameras

563
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,765
until we get to the moon rock room,

564
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:13,434
and that's where it gets tough.

565
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:15,620
One way in, one way out.

566
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:18,022
I mean, if we get caught, we're trapped.

567
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,442
Guys. Guys!

568
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,946
Thanks!

569
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,409
So... the rock.

570
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:33,036
Whole lotta wards around it,
nothing we can't get past,

571
00:23:33,037 --> 00:23:35,309
except for the one on the rock itself.

572
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:38,699
It's... well, it's a bond that
we've never seen before,

573
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,160
put there by Mayakovsky.

574
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:42,389
Well, that can't be right.

575
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,964
Oren just got the rock.

576
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:45,715
And didn't you say the last time

577
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:48,176
you saw Mayakovsky,
he was basically senile?

578
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:49,929
Yeah, well, I guess he got better.

579
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,059
I mean, he... he put his signature

580
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,499
into the lattice work of the spell.

581
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,699
You can't miss it.
It's the most amazing,

582
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,770
most narcissistic thing I've ever seen.

583
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:01,380
Mm.

584
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:05,019
- Hey, Eliot?
- Hm?

585
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,529
Can I talk to you for a sec?

586
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,559
Yeah.

587
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,349
I said I'm fine.

588
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:14,989
I have been awake for
thousands of hours straight.

589
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,349
Look, I saw your moment back there,

590
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,165
and I think I might know what's up.

591
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:21,560
You think you do, but you don't.

592
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,959
Okay, so the first two nights, no sleep,

593
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,669
things got a little weird, right?

594
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:30,510
Like picking up my
phone to call Quentin.

595
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,513
You know, I must've done
that like five times.

596
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,560
But then my brain crossed
over into darker...

597
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:42,109
Here's the deal.

598
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,879
When the Sister was in me,

599
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,484
I remember everything.

600
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,154
Every bloody second of it.

601
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:51,719
And usually, I'm good
at pushing it away,

602
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,259
but right now...

603
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:57,429
it is like a constant
slideshow in the background.

604
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:00,206
Not fun. El.

605
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,960
The Monster was in you for months.

606
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,490
Well, it was different.

607
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,008
People have different experiences.

608
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:12,879
All that time was just
one big nap to me,

609
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,309
which... sounds so good right now.

610
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,599
I don't know why you're lying to me.

611
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,810
Or anyone.

612
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:24,231
I don't know why you're
accusing me of lying.

613
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,459
Okay.

614
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:30,199
Neither of us have the
bandwidth for this right now,

615
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,072
and I don't trust you.

616
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:34,449
I don't.

617
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,535
But if you ever do decide to talk,

618
00:25:36,536 --> 00:25:38,640
open door.

619
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:57,439
Shit.

620
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,869
If I may, lenses can be sensitive

621
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,719
to changes in your
Internal Circumstances.

622
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,396
You may need to adjust
if you're feeling off.

623
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,799
God damn it.

624
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,919
If something is bothering you,

625
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,799
I know I'm not the ideal
person to talk to,

626
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,111
but I am here.

627
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:14,400
I'm not feeling chatty
at the moment, okay?

628
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,859
Look, you're not the only
one that made a mistake,

629
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,708
'cause clearly it's still bothering me.

630
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,410
It's Fogg.

631
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:31,299
He's stuck in the Etheric Realm,

632
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:34,419
and it's my fault.

633
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,960
Henry's in...

634
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,209
He always was a sensualist.

635
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:44,018
That place is a trap for people
like him, who enjoy, well...

636
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,269
- Getting wasted?
- Mm.

637
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,819
He was trying to quit.

638
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,019
He shouldn't have even been in there.

639
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,402
He was only in there because of me.

640
00:26:51,403 --> 00:26:52,639
And you were only there

641
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,280
because you wanted to help the hedges.

642
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:58,110
You know, if we're being honest...

643
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,953
I wanted to get high.

644
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,760
Lucky me, that's the only
way into the Etheric Realm.

645
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:08,339
Fogg just...

646
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,336
tagged along and got unlucky.

647
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,209
That wasn't luck.

648
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,039
I know the Emperor of the Realm.

649
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,139
If he kept Henry behind,

650
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,279
it was because he sensed a flaw in him.

651
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,560
And if he kicked you out,

652
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:22,223
it was because you were
trying to do something good.

653
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:24,139
Nothing bores him like goodness.

654
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,179
Yeah, how do you know that?

655
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:28,229
I spent three years there once.

656
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:29,940
Jesus.

657
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,550
Before I came to the Library,
my life was... difficult.

658
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:40,033
The Etheric Realm was an escape.

659
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:42,029
How did you get out?

660
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:45,080
I stopped hating myself. Eventually.

661
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,499
And then the Emperor grew bored with me.

662
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,419
Whatever kept Henry there,
those were his demons,

663
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,380
and that is something you couldn't fix.

664
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,460
Well, it doesn't stop me from
feeling like shit about it.

665
00:27:57,468 --> 00:27:59,689
The fact that you feel like shit,

666
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:01,305
that is why you escaped.

667
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:04,391
So allow me to be blunt.

668
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,239
Don't waste time on self-pity.

669
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,147
Do what you came to do.

670
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,733
Thanks.

671
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:17,278
I'll try to be less of a bitch to you.

672
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,906
Mm. If you can.

673
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,619
It's working.

674
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,419
I can see the wards.

675
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,710
This way.

676
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:45,050
It sounds like he's home.
Look, fair warning...

677
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,980
Who the hell are you?

678
00:28:51,981 --> 00:28:53,909
We're looking for Mayakovsky.

679
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:56,079
Old, drunk, megalomaniac?

680
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,902
Fondness for knit caps?

681
00:28:57,903 --> 00:28:59,153
Yeah, I'm his daughter.

682
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,780
I didn't realize he...

683
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:02,679
Fucked my mother? Neither did he.

684
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,449
Should've seen his face
when I came knockin'.

685
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:07,950
But we're fine now. What do you want?

686
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:09,455
Can you let us down?

687
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,916
Sure.

688
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,310
Thanks.

689
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,469
Look.

690
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,424
We need to talk to your dad.

691
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:22,169
He's busy.

692
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:23,428
On our project.

693
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:25,409
Look, we think he may be the only person

694
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,723
that can help us save the world.

695
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:29,889
He put a special magical
bond on a moon rock,

696
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,779
and we need his help to break it.

697
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:35,857
Wait, please tell me you're
trying to rob Oren Westbrook.

698
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:38,689
- How do you know that?
- I installed that bond.

699
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:42,071
Yeah, last nice thing I did
before I dumped his greasy ass.

700
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:43,689
- That was you?
- What? You dated him?

701
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,992
Don't judge, but yes.

702
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:48,079
Anyfuck, right after
I installed the bond,

703
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,699
I caught the maid pegging him,

704
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,999
and not the maid I
okayed for threesomes.

705
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,409
- Mm...
- Okay.

706
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:56,003
So that means you'll help us?

707
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,588
I could.

708
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:00,589
But I need something from you.

709
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,800
A shade.

710
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,386
Either of yours will do.

711
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,348
What are you gonna do with it?

712
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:11,267
- Are we gonna get it back?
- No.

713
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:13,061
- You want my help?
- Mm-hmm.

714
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:15,855
One shade, payment in advance.

715
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:17,232
Discuss.

716
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:32,080
- It's safe.
- Thanks.

717
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,849
Any idea where to find a
medical manual in here?

718
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,779
Unfortunately,
the organizational systems

719
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,840
are down, so it may...

720
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,522
May I?

721
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:03,153
Hm.

722
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:08,449
Sometimes I forget you're
a fucking master Magician.

723
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,533
I try to keep the
showboating to a minimum.

724
00:31:10,534 --> 00:31:12,739
Well, the Harmonic Convergence
is in a few hours.

725
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,279
- You know what that means.
- I'll take this to Harriet ASAP.

726
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:20,299
Tell her if, God forbid,
we can't stop it...

727
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,714
we might need all the hedges we
can get to unfuck everything.

728
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:40,300
_

729
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,777
_

730
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,479
Desperate times, huh?

731
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,979
Didn't really have much choice.

732
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:51,409
Hey, uh, Julia?

733
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,119
Can you remind me why I'm
dressed like this, please?

734
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,279
He's been like this all night.

735
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,832
Just running on muffin fumes.

736
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:00,209
Okay, let's just make sure
we're all on the same page.

737
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:03,079
Okay? Okay, so Josh, Margo, Penny.

738
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,999
You guys go inside,
loop all the cameras,

739
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,599
open the side door for Natasha.

740
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,968
I'll be outside waiting
with Eliot and Alice.

741
00:32:08,969 --> 00:32:10,809
We won't cast the spell
until your signal.

742
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:12,263
You won't miss it. Ready?

743
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:13,730
Break.

744
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:23,317
Eliot. What are you staring at?

745
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,520
Pull the ripcord, get out.
We'll handle this.

746
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:28,863
I am not cocking out.

747
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:31,159
You're not right, El,
and we both know why.

748
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,952
My crippling fear of/
attraction to authority?

749
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:36,119
Are you being honest with me?

750
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,940
Bambi, always.

751
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,669
I don't care if you've
been keeping it from me,

752
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,418
but all of our asses
are on the line now.

753
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:44,269
Margo.

754
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:45,546
Do not worry about me.

755
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:47,779
I know, I've been a little bit off.

756
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,409
Blame it on the moon brain.

757
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:51,930
I promise I'm fine.

758
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,430
'Kay?

759
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:09,154
_

760
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,999
Hey! How are you?

761
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:37,919
Oh.

762
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,879
Uh, no guests.

763
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,739
Can you fetch me another
plate of those crab puffs?

764
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,799
- Delish.
- Head of security.

765
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,489
- Not your waiter.
- Oh, good for you.

766
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:53,782
Have you tried the crab puffs?

767
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:58,596
Hey, my drink!

768
00:33:58,597 --> 00:34:00,159
- What the...
- Watch the suit!

769
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,769
That's the third time
you've done that tonight!

770
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:04,399
Watch what you're doing!

771
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,649
I'm gonna take you outside right now.

772
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:08,130
All right, fellas,
break it up, break it up.

773
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:17,109
I looped that one,

774
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:19,019
but I don't remember
if I looped that one.

775
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,919
You don't remember five seconds ago?

776
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,353
Josh, I haven't had short-term
memory in two days.

777
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,354
The only things I remember

778
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:26,799
are being worried about Eliot

779
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,775
and feeling like shit for trying
to leave you in the past.

780
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,069
Really?

781
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,959
Fucking moon brain.

782
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,110
Totally spaced out.

783
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:38,743
Why are you looking at me like that?

784
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:40,920
These are good.

785
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,160
Let's go.

786
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,549
It's true. It's true.

787
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,479
Excuse me, sir.

788
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,389
Excuse me.

789
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:59,129
We have an issue.

790
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,079
Natasha?

791
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,183
What the hell is she doing here?

792
00:35:02,184 --> 00:35:04,602
Well, my men will find out,
but I have a hunch.

793
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:07,850
There's one thing you own
that only she can steal.

794
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,705
Bring back the rock.

795
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:32,130
- Stop!
- Wh...

796
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:34,173
Right there, right there!

797
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:37,802
Let's go!

798
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,969
Natasha. Where is she going?

799
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:51,509
For the last time, we don't know.

800
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:54,111
And even if we did,
we would never admit it.

801
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:57,698
No bother.

802
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,150
My men have her now.

803
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:14,588
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. What's going on?

804
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,829
- Where's the moon rock?
- What... I don't...

805
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:17,842
I don't know!

806
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:19,179
Look, I was just hitchhiking,

807
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:21,540
and a woman, she just threw
the keys at me, okay?

808
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,306
Just take the van, whatever.

809
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,810
Look, she went that way.

810
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,479
She escaped?

811
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,774
Where's the rock?

812
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:45,119
Well, I officially have moon brain.

813
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:47,699
I can see Her aura. It's red.

814
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:51,219
Let's do this quick
before anyone comes in.

815
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,877
How long do we have to
cast the first part again?

816
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:56,339
Until Her aura turns green
and She's listening.

817
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:14,523
It's working.

818
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,740
Where is Natasha taking the rock?

819
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:24,700
Okay... okay.

820
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:26,949
She said she was going to Philly.

821
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:29,994
The only thing worse than
a traitor is a snitch.

822
00:37:29,995 --> 00:37:31,499
You make me wanna puke.

823
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,179
Hey, hey, Josh.

824
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,119
Do you have any more muffins?

825
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:41,718
Almost there.

826
00:37:47,849 --> 00:37:49,259
We had it.

827
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,351
What happened?

828
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:52,561
How did it turn red?

829
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:54,179
Eliot?

830
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,399
Wait, Eliot, come back!

831
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,520
We don't have enough power
to finish this without you.

832
00:37:58,270 --> 00:37:59,920
Eliot.

833
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,990
Eliot...

834
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:07,827
Let me out.

835
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:36,909
You're not there.

836
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:38,650
You're gone forever.

837
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,945
Quentin threw you in the Seam.

838
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:50,119
This isn't happening.
This is moon brain.

839
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,338
Stop right there!

840
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:07,080
My guards are in the
room with your friends.

841
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,307
The rock never left, did it?

842
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,609
You know, I want the snitch

843
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:15,228
to tell me what's really going on.

844
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,649
- What happened?
- Asshole fell asleep again.

845
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:23,569
His fight-or-flight response
is to take a fucking nap.

846
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,299
Or something else is up.

847
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,569
It wasn't me.

848
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:45,379
In here, boss.

849
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:51,379
Marina.

850
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,130
Ladies.

851
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,969
Did you put the guards to sleep?

852
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:58,319
Yeah,

853
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,231
but I'm a little confused why
you aren't snoozing too.

854
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,818
The only thing stronger
than that spell is...

855
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,614
Oh, my God. Are you on meth?

856
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,359
You know, it sure as hell seems like it.

857
00:40:20,377 --> 00:40:21,542
What are you doing here?

858
00:40:21,543 --> 00:40:23,359
Keeping you from fucking up my shit.

859
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,090
Harmonic Convergence, I need it.

860
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:29,969
Like Daddy always said,

861
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,971
even meth can't beat handcuffs.

862
00:40:31,972 --> 00:40:33,973
I don't think you understand
how bad the Convergence is.

863
00:40:33,974 --> 00:40:35,929
No, I do.

864
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:39,311
But what you don't understand
is how good it is for me.

865
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:40,980
I have a very critical mission,

866
00:40:40,981 --> 00:40:42,839
and I need the power
convergence boost to do it.

867
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:47,689
So just this one time,
could you please go home?

868
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:48,979
Look, whatever it is you're doing,

869
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,609
it's not worth the world.

870
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:51,999
Mm, yes, it is.

871
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,200
I put a shitload of work into this.

872
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:55,719
I stole a Book Depository,
for Christ sake.

873
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,980
That was you?

874
00:40:58,123 --> 00:41:00,749
You sent that memory assassin after me.

875
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,489
Yeah, and not a life assassin.

876
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:03,819
You're welcome.

877
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:07,756
We're even, since you
tipped us to this party.

878
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:09,299
- Frederick here...
- That's not my name.

879
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,469
Okay, not-Frederick here,

880
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,279
overheard you in my Book Depository

881
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,760
making these exciting plans
for the Convergence.

882
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:18,308
Speaking of...

883
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,728
just started.

884
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:25,130
I flinch, it fires.

885
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:28,444
Oh...

886
00:41:28,445 --> 00:41:30,029
I think we all know what that was.

887
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,079
It's the surge.

888
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,364
You know what that means, Chickee-poo?

889
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:33,866
Power is insane.

890
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:35,451
You're holding a nuke right now.

891
00:41:35,452 --> 00:41:37,619
You let that thing go,
we all go bye-bye.

892
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,080
Kady, she's right; with the
Convergence and the surge,

893
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:42,124
every spell is, like,
super-powered right now.

894
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:44,879
Yeah, I bet you could
cast something solo

895
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,529
that would normally take three people.

896
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:49,119
- Isn't that what I just said?
- Marina!

897
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,460
Please, we are so close
to saving everyone.

898
00:41:51,468 --> 00:41:53,260
You can't just take
that away from us now.

899
00:41:53,261 --> 00:41:54,869
Whatever it is you're after,

900
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:56,973
what's the point if there's no world?

901
00:41:56,974 --> 00:42:00,560
There'll still be a world,
just not as many people.

902
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:02,849
- Have you met people?
- She's listening!

903
00:42:02,850 --> 00:42:04,519
Eliot, go!

904
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,107
- The fuck are you doing?
- I've got it.

905
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:09,234
- You're moving the moon?
- Yeah.

906
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,159
I'm moving it back.

907
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:42,811
Uh...

908
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,340
guys?

909
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,880
I think we just broke the moon.

910
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,700
Ah, shit.

911
