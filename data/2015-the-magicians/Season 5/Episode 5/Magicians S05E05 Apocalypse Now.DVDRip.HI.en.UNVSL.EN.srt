MARGO: <i>Previously
on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:06,163
There's too much magic.
Everything that I touch just...

3
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:07,998
It grows like crazy.

4
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:09,974
I'm gonna let
your bullshit slide

5
00:00:10,043 --> 00:00:13,844
on account of you so recently being
possessed by a homicidal monster.

KADY: <i>There was
a blood worm scare,</i>

7
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:17,160
so the Library gave a lot
of Hedges the Reed's Mark.

8
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:19,710
<i>I found a spell to remove
the marks in a depository.</i>

9
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,289
I get you're on a mission.
One of you has gotta jet.

10
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:24,382
Either one of you
can hang for eternity.

11
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,922
I've earned the
right to step off.

ALICE: We're here to
study with Mayakovsky.

13
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:30,727

I'm Clarion, Goddess of Melody.

19
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:42,941
The way that you're imagining
the Harmonic Convergence

20
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,341
isn't quite enough.

21
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:47,472
<i>When all the spells cast by
all of the Magicians go haywire,</i>

22
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:50,518

00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:52,549
She didn't have
time to be delicate.

24
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,419
You can't travel anymore.

25
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,550
What exactly are
we looking for, sir?

26
00:00:57,157 --> 00:00:59,023
CAPTAIN: <i>Not what. Who.</i>

27
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:00,390
You two know each other?

28
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:01,518
No.

29
00:01:01,595 --> 00:01:03,239
ELIOT: Well, your
subjects are rightly grateful.

30
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:04,322
For sending that letter?

31
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,594
A.K.A. that thing I
totally didn't do, you did.

32
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,962
I was gonna let
you die for Fillory.

33
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,765
ZELDA: The Convergence
can be stopped.

34
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:15,809
All you have to do is move that.

35
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:20,447
The Harmonic Convergence. Mmm.

36
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:22,379
A.K.A. the end of the world.

37
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:23,644
Not necessarily.

38
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:28,812
This constellation forms a cosmic
sigil that increases magical intensity.

39
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:31,425
It has happened in the past
without causing an apocalypse.

40
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:33,187
But now there's surges of magic.

41
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,423
So we get the disaster movie
Clarion was talking about.

42
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,762
The Convergence will only
occur during this perfect alignment.

43
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,536
If we move the
moon out of position...

44
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:45,698
No Convergence, no
circumstance, no apocalypse.

45
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:49,470
The moon is not just a rock in
space. It has certain properties.

46
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,442
Like? Magic doesn't work on it.

47
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,540
Thanks to Magicians casting
haphazardly on it for millennia,

48
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:57,949
the moon is now covered by a crust
of spell debris, blocking new spells.

49
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:01,488
If we move any piece out
of place, no Convergence.

50
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:06,125
"What if we just moved Mars?"
she said with a straight face.

51
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,752
The other pieces are planets.

52
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:12,089
We can't move them because
they are, well, very big and far away.

53
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:15,567
The moon is the only celestial
body we stand a chance of affecting.

54
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:17,764
Won't that screw with
the circumstances?

55
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:19,318
What'll magic be
like when we're done?

56
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:22,169
Impossible to know. It will
be a brand-new circumstance.

57
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:27,604
But to get to that problem,
we need to solve this one.

58
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:30,321
Good. Well, I hope you have some
ideas, because we're striking out.

59
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:32,652
I do. Consult the Lunatics.

60
00:02:34,221 --> 00:02:36,349
The Lunatics? Short
for Lunar Fanatics.

61
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:37,857
In the Middle Ages,

62
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:41,327
people thought insanity was caused
by changing phases of the moon.

63
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:44,159
In fact, it was often a Lunatic
in the throes of worship.

64
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:47,959
They claim to be able to achieve a
magical connection with the moon,

65
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:51,130
and even, under some
circumstances, move it.

66
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,332
That sounds useful. Mmm.

67
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,207
Well, if it's just branding, it means
they're not really crazy, right?

68
00:02:57,778 --> 00:03:00,373
My dad always said that
they were batshit insane.

69
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,641
And he married my mom,

70
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:04,207
so he had a pretty high
bar for mental instability.

71
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:07,378
Regardless, they know more
about the moon than anyone.

72
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:10,389
I believe that talking to them
is our only chance at success.

73
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:15,886
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

74
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:32,689
What people don't understand is
there is a skeleton of the universe,

75
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,045
but we are the bones.

76
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:36,206
Oh, that's good to know.

77
00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:40,079
I am a humerus. You, patella.

78
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:44,187
We wanted to ask you about
the moon. Can we talk about it?

79
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,189
It... "It"?

80
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:48,923
Her Lunacy

81
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:53,830
identifies as she/her.

82
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:56,498
That's right. We
knew that. Right?

83
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:57,903
Of course.

84
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:01,604
If we wanted to move
her, how could we do that?

85
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:04,103
You don't move her.

86
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:06,043
Okay, listen, Reba.

87
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:09,544
In just a few days, a whole
lot of people are going to die.

88
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,636
That's a whole lot of people that
will never get to worship the moon.

89
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:14,621
They will never get to
know her like you do.

90
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,685
If she can help us
save all of those lives,

91
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,228
imagine everyone
that will realize

92
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:24,626
just how much she deserves
their love, their reverence.

93
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:26,589
So will you help us?

94
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,032
Just to be clear...

95
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:33,038
You don't move her.

96
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:36,568
You ask her to move.

97
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:40,044
And she won't let you speak to
her unless you get moon brain.

98
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:41,875
So, one of us needs moon brain.

99
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,247
Not one of you. Three of you.

100
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:48,816
A single Magician cannot
generate enough power to reach her.

101
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:50,584
So it's a cooperative
spell then?

102
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:52,717
It is a sign of
respect, Kneecap,

103
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:55,328
that allows you to
see her as she truly is.

104
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:58,160
If you have moon brain,
then you will see her aura.

105
00:04:58,265 --> 00:04:59,324
Now, it is red.

106
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,444
But when you perform the
Dianic Ritual, her aura will change.

107
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:05,633
If it is yellow, she is considering.
If it is green, she is listening.

108
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:10,667
Only then may you
ask her to move.

109
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:12,344
JULIA: Red, yellow, green.

110
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:15,938
Did the guy who invented the
stoplight... Was he a Lunatic, too?

111
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,645
William Potts? Yeah.

112
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,681
Oh. Cool.

113
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:23,154
All three Magicians
must perform the ritual

114
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:25,385
until the moon is listening.

115
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:28,222
A warning. Once
her aura is green,

116
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,457
she may choose to listen to
anyone who calls to her, so be ready.

117
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,158
You must choose one, the
strongest among you, to speak to her.

118
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:36,794
Like the Old
Lunatics taught us to.

119
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:39,644
For the second part,
however, there is a price.

120
00:05:39,706 --> 00:05:41,038
A price? Like, blood?

121
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,666
It is like blood to her.

122
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:46,775
You will need a piece
of her. A sacrifice.

123
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:48,113
A piece?

124
00:05:48,882 --> 00:05:50,942
What, like a moon rock? Yes.

125
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,780
But be aware,
this will destroy it.

126
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:58,017
So, don't use your favorite one.

127
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,558
This is the price of
speaking to the moon.

128
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,694
JULIA: Just a few
more questions.

129
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:06,892
What is moon brain,
and how do we get it?

130
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,832
ORDERLY: Everyone,
line up. Pudding time.

131
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:13,970
Lovely to speak to you. You,
too, Kneecap. (CLICKS TONGUE)

133
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,272
You ever just spin a globe,

134
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,543
stick your finger down,
see where it lands?

135
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:26,013
It's almost always water,

136
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:28,351
because, duh,
Earth is mostly water.

137
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:33,587
But sometimes it's the
Sahara, sometimes the Urals.

138
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:36,595
That's what you'd be
doing if you tried to travel.

139
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:39,831
Only instead of the
globe, the multiverse,

140
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,062
which is bigger and deadlier.

141
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:43,997
Afraid you'd say that.

142
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:47,307
I looked at everything I could
think of, magical and medical.

143
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,534
<i>Nada.</i>

144
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:49,608
You're grounded.

145
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:52,622
All right, well, since
I ain't traveling,

146
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:53,723
I should probably step down.

147
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:56,182
Uh, if you're offering your
resignation, I don't accept.

148
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:58,080
Not offering. Stating.

149
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:00,176

There's no instruction manual,

155
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:12,808
so I'm kind of
dean-ing on the fly here.

156
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,425
But one thing I do know is

157
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:17,960
losing a professor who was disabled
on school grounds ain't happening.

158
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:20,768
I mean, the optics
would be pure shit flakes.

159
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,402
So, your contract will be
honored. And enforced.

160
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:26,374

163
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:38,291
it's a goddamn goose-stepping,

Fairy-snatching, ethnic
cleansing Gestapo.

165
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,127
To be fair,

166
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:45,164
the ethnic cleansing happened
after the Dark King left, so...

167
00:07:45,398 --> 00:07:47,128
He's innocent
because he delegates?

168
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,758
No, that's not what I'm saying.

169
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:49,979
Someone in this

171
00:07:51,104 --> 00:07:52,470

173
00:07:55,675 --> 00:08:00,807
so we have to find out
who before we coup.

174
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,280
I just want to stab someone.

175
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:06,782
I haven't heard you
this bloodthirsty in...

176
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:09,722
Well, not that long. But,
still, it's notable. (SIGHS)

177
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:14,158
Maybe I'm a bit on edge.
Josh keeps wanting to talk.

178
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,700
You mean about how you wanted
to leave him in the past to die?

179
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:17,957
Yeah, that.

180
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:21,196
So far I'm doing a
good job of avoiding him,

181
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:22,735
but eventually
he's gonna sneak...

182
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:25,465
Guys. Hey. What's up?

183
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,898
'Sup? First off, kudos
on the hiding spot.

184
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,169
Took me forever to find you.

185
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:30,569
Pretty busy here, Josh.

186
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,805
You're busy? I just got
promoted to head chef.

187
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:34,871
ELIOT: Oh,
congratulations. Thank you.

188
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:36,879
But I'm about to
bail on a state dinner

189
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:39,350
and leave it to my incompetent
sous chef because...

190
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,579
BUNNY: Apocalypse! Now!

191
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:43,379
Josh, would you just give it up?

192
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,101
He keeps trying to get
us to join his film club,

193
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:48,687
which I told him would never work
on a planet with no electricity or taste.

194
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:51,926
Uh, no. Sorry. This
one's just a little shy.

195
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,398
It's okay, buddy.

196
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,902
Help us stop the...
Apocalypse. Now!

197
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,038
Oh.

198
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,299
We need to get back to Earth.

199
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,820
Margo, our talk will have to
wait till after we save the world.

200
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,303
Oh, but then I have my nephew's
bar mitzvah. So, after that?

201
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,013
Mazel. JOSH: Thanks.

202
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,250
(SIGHS)

203
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:13,585
What about our thing?

204
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:17,053
We have a lot of fact-finding to
do before I can get to stabbing.

205
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:20,218
No problem. I know
just who to handle it.

206
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,960
FEN: <i>You want me to what?</i>

207
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:25,726
Just find out who in the
castle hates Fairies. Okay?

208
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,563
And what they're doing to them.

209
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:29,227
And why Fairies
in the first place.

210
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:32,331
And maybe talk to some
Fairies. Get their side of things.

211
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,896
Okay. And while you're at it...

212
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,169
Yeah? Anything else
that seems important.

213
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,070
Okay. Okay. Okay.

214
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:41,046
No, um, that seems like a lot of
open-ended questions. Mmm-hmm.

215
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,747
Um, I got this maid job
to be close to you guys,

216
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,615
and now you're deserting me?

217
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:48,620
(CHUCKLES) I want to
stop an apocalypse, too.

218
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,758
Every apocalypse-stopping
mission

219
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:53,794
needs a maid on the outside.

220
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,052
It's a key staple
in Earth movies.

221
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:58,729
Do you mean inside man? 'Cause
that's more of a heist movie thing.

222
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,098
No, that's different. Okay.

223
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:04,626
Everyone knows the secret,
sexy maid on the outside trope.

224
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:05,737
Yeah?

225
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,306
Josh has a film club.
You should check it out.

226
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:09,535
(CHUCKLES)

227
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,101
Maid on the outside, yeah.

228
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:17,614
So, did your loony friend
say how to get moon brain?

229
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:21,484
From what we've read, her rituals
are simple first-year Popper tuts.

230
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:27,117
But moon brain is the insanity you
get from extreme sleep deprivation.

231
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:29,719
Extreme like a night partying?
Or what are we talking about?

232
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:30,996
I wish.

233
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:32,799
Five nights without sleep,

234
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:34,960
and we can't use magic
to stay awake, either.

235
00:10:35,034 --> 00:10:37,401
Apparently, moon brain
has to come about naturally.

236
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,936
This is completely nuts.

237
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:42,335
Isn't the Harmonic whatever
happening in five nights?

238
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:44,434
Yes. So if we all start tonight

239
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:46,309
we might actually have
a shot at stopping it.

240
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:47,692
Wait a minute. Wait. (CHUCKLING)

241
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,215
Five nights without sleep
is gonna fuck us up royally.

242
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,211
Can we even cast if
we're that messed up?

243
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,783
Well, three of us have to.

244
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:56,621
JULIA: Look, guys,
I know it sucks.

245
00:10:56,689 --> 00:11:02,754
But whoever can stay up for 132
hours without sleep and not lose their shit

246
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,550
gets to stop the apocalypse.

247
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:14,065
I don't know about you
guys, but I am doing great.

248
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:16,041
Coffee.

249
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,542
Where's our fearless leader?

250
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:20,136
She's taking a cold shower
to keep herself awake.

251
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:22,341
Third, fourth time this morning.

252
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:26,351
Well, I don't know about you
guys, but I am too excited to sleep.

253
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:27,892
(ELIOT SIGHS) I
mean, we're doing it.

254
00:11:28,221 --> 00:11:30,884
Is this, uh, helping
you find moon rocks?

255
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,024
Mmm.

256
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,725
No, this is helping
us stay awake.

257
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:37,788
The moment I research,
I'm out like a light.

258
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:38,864
Know what might help?

259
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:41,197
If we make this party a
little more '80s themed.

260
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:42,467
MAN: <i>Eliot.</i>

261
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,498
Oh, I don't think we should.

262
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:47,316
If we ski the fresh
powder... Know what I mean?

263
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,740
JOSH: Yeah, I get it.

264
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,470
MARGO: I mean
cocaine. Get me cocaine.

265
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,638
JOSH: I am not getting
you cocaine. MAN: <i>Eliot.</i>

266
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,925
JOSH: A five-day bender
would destroy your nose,

267
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:58,578
and could you imagine what that
would do to your sense of taste?

268
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:01,005
MARGO: I get a full nine
every night and I'm still a bitch.

269
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,181
This is gonna get real.

270
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,121
Hey, guys, come check this out.

271
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:08,821
I found something.

272
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,391
NASA brought back
a bunch of moon rocks

273
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:12,658
from the Apollo missions.

274
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,927
We're stealing from NASA?

275
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:16,593
Hell yeah. Momma's checking
one more off her bucket list.

276
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:19,366
Okay, we're not stealing from
NASA. I checked. It's impossible.

277
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,970
I'm sorry. But some of the
rocks that they brought back,

278
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,075
they gave out as gifts

279
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:24,269
and they went missing.

280
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:26,403
About 180.

281
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:30,739
The ones they did find, they found them
in garages, desk drawers, kids' bedrooms.

282
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,285
Just lying around.
People forgot about them.

283
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:35,981
But they're out there. And I
definitely think we can get one.

284
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,389
Okay, you guys do that. I'm gonna
go get some stay-awake supplies.

285
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:41,928
I have a muffin recipe
with a special ingredient

286
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,153
that is guaranteed to
keep us alert for five days.

287
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,921
What is it? Meth?

288
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:48,896
Oh, excuse you.
It is an organic,

289
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:51,301
locally-sourced,
natural stimulant

290
00:12:51,404 --> 00:12:53,566
that got me through
every finals week,

291
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,869
and it is definitely not meth.

292
00:12:55,141 --> 00:12:57,941
That's exactly what I would say
if I was trying to get us to take meth.

293
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,272
(JOSH CHORTLES) Mmm-hmm.

294
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,784
You're taking retirement well.

295
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,455
I find that organization
helps bring a sense of stability

296
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,497
when one's feeling not stable.

297
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:18,730
Okay.

298
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,180
I need to find a Book
Depository that got moved.

299
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:24,413
It's in Hell's Kitchen.
That's all I know.

300
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:27,271
Library buildings are enchanted
to blend in with their new environs

301
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,603
whenever they're relocated.

302
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,273
You'll have to go door-to-door,

303
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:32,107
find the building
covered in Library wards.

304
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:33,644
Great. Let's go.

305
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:35,186
You're abandoning your friends?

306
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,012
They have enough
people for a rock search.

307
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:40,910
Plus, whatever's
in Josh's muffins

308
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,898
doesn't sound like something a
person in recovery should be taking.

309
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:43,922
Hmm.

310
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,488
I need to find the Depository

311
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,857
before we move the
moon and screw up magic.

312
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:51,187
Right now, we have enough
to remove Reed's Marks.

313
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:53,766
After? Like you said. Who knows?

314
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:58,568
I'm not sure I'd be much
use to you, out in the world.

315
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,368
The building is
impenetrable on a good day.

316
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,667
Unless you're a Librarian who
knows the security protocols.

317
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,206
I don't know.

318
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:10,116
I'm not asking for your help.

319
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:14,545
I'm giving you a chance to fix
your massive, massive mistake.

320
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,188
Mmm.

321
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:18,223
Let's go.

322
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:36,267
High King Fen?

323
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,410
(GASPS) Fairy.

324
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:42,880
Keep the High King
talk quiet. I'm undercover.

325
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,607
You will come with me. Oh.

326
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:47,977
That... That is so great. I
have a lot of questions for you.

327
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,550
Some, I don't even
know why I'm asking.

328
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,355
They said you would fear me.

329
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:56,257
Funny thing, I'm
on a Fairy quest.

330
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:59,457
See, I'm a maid on the outside.

331
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,995
Super-secret, super-sexy.

332
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,770
Follow me, Maid
On The Outside Fen.

333
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,068
Good. Okay.

334
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,337
MARGO: Guess what I
found. You found a moon rock?

335
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,853
I found a moon rock.

336
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,256
And those muffins smell
amazing. Thank you.

337
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:26,224
Now all we have
to do is stay awake.

338
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:29,090
You know what helps me
stay awake? What's that?

339
00:15:29,195 --> 00:15:33,257
An open, naked conversation
about our relationship.

340
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:34,633
(SHUDDERS)

341
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:37,795
I wanna tell you about

had better luck than we did.

Nope. We portal-hopped
to every lead we had.

was a chunk of old concrete

in Sharpie. Those rocks are gone.

find Josh sleeping peacefully.

your rudeness

makes you irritable.

the Harmonic Convergence in Fillory.

five seconds ago?

683
00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:13,311
Josh, I haven't had
short-term memory in two days.

684
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:16,878
Only things I remember
are being worried about Eliot

685
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:19,515
and feeling like shit for
trying to leave you in the past.

686
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,058
Really?

687
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:23,861
(CHUCKLING)

688
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:27,059
Fucking moon brain.
Totally spaced out.

689
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:28,932
Why are you looking
at me like that?

690
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:30,501
These are good.

691
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:35,196
Let's go.

692
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:40,377
(ALL LAUGHING)

693
00:34:41,246 --> 00:34:42,976
OREN: It's true.
It's true about...

694
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:46,116
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.

695
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:49,084
We have an issue.

696
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:52,128
OREN: Natasha? What
the hell is she doing here?

697
00:34:52,357 --> 00:34:54,553
Well, my men will find
out, but I have a hunch.

698
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:57,262
There's one thing you
own that only she can steal.

699
00:34:58,396 --> 00:34:59,396
(LOUD THUD)

700
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:13,637
Bring back the rock.

701
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:22,110
Stop! MAN: Wait!

702
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:24,301
MAN 2: Right there, right there!

703
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:27,958
Let's go.

704
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:37,626
Natasha. Where is she going?

705
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:41,106
For the last time,
we don't know.

706
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:43,940
And even if we did,
we would never admit it.

707
00:35:46,411 --> 00:35:47,572
HEAD OF SECURITY: No bother.

708
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,111
My men have her now.

709
00:36:02,327 --> 00:36:03,761
Whoa, whoa, whoa... (STUTTERS)

710
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,626
What's going on?
Where's the moon rock?

711
00:36:05,964 --> 00:36:07,523
What? I don't... I don't know.

712
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:11,503
Look, I was just hitchhiking, and a
woman, she just threw the keys at me, okay?

713
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:13,231
Look, just take
the van, whatever.

714
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,772
Look, she... She went that way.

715
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:23,776
She escaped? Where's the rock?

716
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:35,024
Well, I officially
have moon brain.

717
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:37,191
I can see her aura. It's red.

718
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:41,094
Let's do this quick,
before anyone comes in.

719
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,977
How long do we have to
cast the first part again?

720
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:45,937
Until her aura turns
green and she's listening.

721
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:03,848
It's working.

722
00:37:10,295 --> 00:37:12,696
Where is Natasha
taking the rock?

723
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:16,061
Okay, okay. She said
she was going to Philly.

724
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:19,938
The only thing worse
than a traitor is a snitch.

725
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:22,074
You make me wanna puke.

726
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,871
Hey, Josh. Do you
have any more muffins?

727
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,105
JULIA: Almost there.

728
00:37:33,885 --> 00:37:34,885
(EXHALES)

729
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:40,290
Wait. We had it. What happened?

730
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:41,984
How did it turn red?

731
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,294
Eliot? Wait. Eliot, come back.

732
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:47,516
We don't have enough
power to finish this without you.

733
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:49,399
MAN: <i>Eliot.</i>

734
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:52,931
<i>Eliot.</i>

735
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:57,599
<i>Let me out.</i>

736
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:27,738
You're not there.
You're gone forever.

737
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,365
Quentin threw you in the Seam.

738
00:38:34,012 --> 00:38:35,012
(SIGHS)

739
00:38:36,648 --> 00:38:39,117
This isn't happening.
This is moon brain.

(GUN COCKING)
MAN: Stop right there!

741
00:38:53,765 --> 00:38:56,166
My guards are in the
room with your friends.

742
00:38:57,302 --> 00:38:58,827
The rock never left, did it?

743
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:03,866
I want the snitch to tell me what's
really going on. (WHIMPERING)

744
00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:09,813
What happened?
Asshole fell asleep again.

745
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:12,646
His fight-or-flight response
is to take a fucking nap.

746
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:13,946
(MEN GROANING) (THUDDING)

747
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,153
(MEN SNORING)

748
00:39:22,493 --> 00:39:24,121
Or something else is up.

749
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:28,832
ALICE: Wasn't me.

750
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:34,264
In here, boss.

751
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:39,401
JULIA: Marina. (CHUCKLES)

752
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:42,211
Ladies.

753
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:45,274
Did you put the guards to sleep?

754
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:50,279
Yeah, but I'm a little confused
why you aren't snoozing too.

755
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:52,823
The only thing stronger
than that spell is...

756
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:56,718
Oh, my God. Are you on meth?

757
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:01,029
You know, it sure
as hell seems like it.

758
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:02,695
(SNORING)

759
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:10,641
What are you doing here?

760
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:14,110
Keeping you from fucking up my
shit. Harmonic Convergence, I need it.

761
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:21,047
Like Daddy always said,
even meth can't beat handcuffs.

762
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,163
I don't think you understand
how bad the Convergence is.

763
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:28,387
No, I do. But what you don't
understand is how good it is for me.

764
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,100
I have a very critical mission,

765
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:32,006
and I need the power
Convergence boost to do it.

766
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:36,764
So, just this one time,
could you please go home?

767
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:39,804
Look, whatever it is you're
doing, it's not worth the world.

768
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:42,271
Mmm, yes, it is. I put a
shitload of work into this.

769
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:44,133
I stole a Book Depository,
for Christ's sake.

770
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:46,143
That was you?

771
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:49,807
You sent that memory
assassin after me.

772
00:40:49,914 --> 00:40:52,406
Yeah, not a life
assassin. You're welcome.

773
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:55,815
We're even, since you
tipped us to this party.

774
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,385
Frederick here...
That's not my name.

775
00:40:59,157 --> 00:41:03,424
Okay. Not-Frederick here
overheard you in my Book Depository

776
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:05,827
making these exciting
plans for the Convergence.

777
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,793
Speaking of, it just started.

778
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,230
I flinch, it fires.

779
00:41:17,709 --> 00:41:19,109
I think we all know
what that was.

780
00:41:19,177 --> 00:41:20,406
It's the surge.

781
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,947
You know what that means,
Chickee-poo? Power is insane.

782
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,594
You're holding a nuke right now.

783
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:26,675
You let that thing
go, we all go bye-bye.

784
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:29,151
Kady, she's right. With the
Convergence and the surge,

785
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:31,188
every spell is, like,
super-powered right now.

786
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:35,487
Yeah, I bet you could cast something
solo that would normally take three people.

787
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,960
MARINA: Isn't that
what I just said?

788
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:40,526
JULIA: Marina, please. We're
so close to saving everyone.

789
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:42,327
You can't just take
that away from us now.

790
00:41:42,667 --> 00:41:46,035
Whatever it is you're after,
what's the point if there's no world?

791
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:48,868
There'll still be a world.
Just not as many people.

792
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,002
Have you met people?

793
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:52,637
She's listening. Eliot, go.

794
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:55,814
The fuck are you
doing? I got it.

795
00:41:56,581 --> 00:41:58,311
You're moving the moon? Yeah.

796
00:41:58,583 --> 00:41:59,744
I'm moving it back.

Guys.

802
00:42:39,524 --> 00:42:41,254
I think we just broke the moon.

803
00:42:47,031 --> 00:42:48,031
