Not what. Who.

29
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:06,520
- You two know each other?
- No.

30
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,249
Well, your subjects
are rightly grateful.

31
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,350

didn't do; you did.

33
00:01:11,635 --> 00:01:14,053
I was gonna let you die for Fillory.

34
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:15,809
The Convergence can be stopped.

35
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,830
All you have to do is move...

36
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,070
that.

37
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,490
The Harmonic Convergence.

38
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,330
- AKA the end of the world.
- Not necessarily.

39
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,790
This constellation forms a cosmic sigil

40
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,899
that increases magical intensity.

41
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,489
It has happened in the past
without causing an apocalypse.

42
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,239
But now there's surges of magic.

43
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,489
So we get the disaster movie
Clarion was talking about.

44
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:44,829
The Convergence will only occur
during this perfect alignment.

45
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,570
If we move the moon out of position...

46
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,530
No Convergence, no Circumstance,

47
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,640
no apocalypse.

48
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:54,590
The moon is not just a rock in space.
It has certain properties.

49
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,509
- Like?
- Magic doesn't work on it.

50
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,960
Thanks to Magicians
casting haphazardly on it

51
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:01,360
for millennia, the moon is
now covered by a crust

52
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:03,530
of spell debris, blocking new spells.

53
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,559
If we move any piece out
of place, no Convergence.

54
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,960
Well, what if we just moved Mars?

55
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,439
She said with a straight face.

56
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,819
The other pieces are planets.

57
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,840
We can't move them
because they are, well,

58
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,660
very big and far away.

59
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,290
The moon is the only celestial body

60
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,610
we stand a chance of affecting.

61
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,860
But won't that screw
with the Circumstances?

62
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,369
What will magic be like when we're done?

63
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,820
Impossible to know.

64
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,370
It will be a brand-new Circumstance.

65
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:32,290
But to get to that problem,
we need to solve this one.

66
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,990
Good, well, I hope you have some ideas,

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,209
because we're striking out.

68
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:37,720
I do. Consult the Lunatics.

69
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,429
- The lunatics?
- Short for "Lunar Fanatics."

70
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,310
In the Middle Ages,
people thought insanity

71
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,350
was caused by changing
phases of the moon.

72
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,389
In fact, it was often a Lunatic
in the throes of worship.

73
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,510
They claimed to be able to
achieve a magical connection

74
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,150
with the moon and even under
some circumstances...

75
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,180
move it.

76
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,690
Well, that sounds useful.

77
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,590
- Mm.
- Well, if it's just branding,

78
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,280
it means they're not
really crazy, right?

79
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,370
My dad always said that
they were batshit insane,

80
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,810
and he married my mom,
so he had a pretty high bar

81
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,930
for mental instability.

82
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,390
Regardless, they know more
about the moon than anyone.

83
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,870
I believe that talking to them
is our only chance at success.

That's right. We knew that, right?

101
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,780
- Of course.
- We know.

102
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:06,679
If we wanted to move Her,
how could we do that?

103
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,160
You don't move Her.

00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,399
that will never get to worship the moon.

108
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,970
They will never get to
know Her like you do.

00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,700
If She can help us save
all of those lives...

110
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,270
imagine everyone that will realize

111
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,640
just how much She deserves their love,

112
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:29,989
their reverence.

113
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,667
So will you help us?

114
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,810
Just to be clear.

115
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:39,290
You don't move Her.

116
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,629
You ask Her to move.

117
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:45,049
And She won't let you speak to
Her unless you get moon brain.

118
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,929
So one of us needs moon brain.

119
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,960
Not one of you. Three of you.

120
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,710
A single Magician cannot
generate enough power

121
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,889
to reach Her.

122
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,640
So it's a cooperative spell then.

123
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,769
It is a sign of respect, Kneecap,

124
00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:00,399
that allows you to see
Her as She truly is.

125
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,240
If you have moon brain,
then you will see Her aura.

126
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,430
Now it is red, but when you
perform the Dianic Ritual,

127
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,449
Her aura will change.

128
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,340
If it is yellow, She is considering.

129
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,690
If it is green, She is listening.

130
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,720
Only then may you ask Her

131
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,960
to move.

132
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,250
Red, yellow, green.

133
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,530
The guy who invented the stoplight,

134
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,419
was he a Lunatic too?

00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,910
William Potts? Yeah.

136
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,690
Oh, cool.

137
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,130
All three Magicians
must perform the ritual

138
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,600
until the moon is listening.

139
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,170
A warning: once Her aura is green,
She may choose to listen

140
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,519
to anyone who calls to Her, so be ready.

141
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,019
You must choose one,
the strongest among you,

142
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,860
to speak to Her, like the
old Lunatics taught us to.

143
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,698
For this second part,
however, there is a price.

144
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,700
- A price, like blood?
- It is like blood to Her.

145
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:51,829
You will need a piece
of Her. A sacrifice.

146
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,790
A piece?

147
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,999
- Or like a moon rock?
- Yes.

148
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,270
But be aware,

149
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,300
this will destroy it,

150
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:03,000
so don't use your favorite one.

151
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,629
This is the price of
speaking to the moon.

152
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,759
Just a few more questions.

153
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,010
What is moon brain,
and how do we get it?

154
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,099
- Everyone line up.
- Pudding time!

155
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,139

Of course, that's a thing here.

180
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,340
Yeah, and uh... [CLEARS THROAT]

181
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,869
That makes me acting Dean Lipson.

182
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,280
There's no instruction manual,

183
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,980
so I'm kinda dean-ing on the fly here,

184
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:19,110
but one thing I do know

185
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,510
is losing a professor who was disabled

186
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,039
on school grounds ain't happening.

187
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,590
I mean, the optics would
be pure shitflakes.

188
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,470
So your contract will be
honored and enforced.

189
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,760
Oh, also.

190
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,930
We need a new Welters coach.

191
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,800
I've been on the inside,
and I'm telling you

192
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,349
it's a goddamn goose-stepping,

193
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:46,109
fairy-snatching, ethnic
cleansing Gestapo.

194
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,310
To be fair, the ethnic
cleansing happened

195
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,239
after the Dark King left, so...

196
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,199
He's innocent because he delegates?

197
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,730
No, that's not what I'm saying.

198
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,110
Someone in this castle ordered
the hunt on that Fairy.

199
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,450
It could have been the Dark King,

200
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,850
but if it was someone else,

201
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,659
killing Seb might just
make things worse.

202
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,880
So we have to find out
who before we... coup.

203
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,009
I just wanna stab someone.

204
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,300
I haven't heard you
this bloodthirsty in...

205
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:14,799
well, not that long,
but still, it's notable.

206
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,340
Maybe I'm a bit on edge.

207
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,219
Josh keeps wanting to talk.

208
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,410
You mean about how you wanted

209
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,518
to leave him in the past to die?

210
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,940
Yeah, that.

211
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,150
So far, I'm doing a good
job of avoiding him,

212
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,810
but eventually he's gonna sneak...

213
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,020
Guys.

214
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,590
- Hey, what's up?
- 'Sup?

215
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,028
First off, kudos on the hiding spot.

216
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,239
It took me forever to find you.

217
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,659
Pretty busy here, Josh.

218
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,660
You're busy?

219
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,869
I just got promoted to head chef.

220
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:40,060
- Oh, congratulations.
- Thank you.

221
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,990
But I'm about to bail on a state dinner

222
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,530
and leave it to my incompetent
sous-chef because...

223
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,400
Apocalypse! Now!

224
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,310
Josh, would you just give it up?

225
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,999
He keeps trying to get us
to join his film club,

226
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,709
which I told him would
never work on a planet

227
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,759
with no electricity or taste.

228
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,009
Uh, no, uh, sorry.
This one's just a little shy.

229
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:58,450
It... it's okay, buddy.

230
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,970
- Help us stop the...
- Apocalypse! Now!

231
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:05,280
- Oh.
- We need to get back to Earth.

232
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,850
Margo, our talk will have to wait

233
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,520
till after we save the world.

234
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:10,730
Oh, but then I have my
nephew's bar mitzvah.

235
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,360
So after that?

236
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:15,199
- Mazel.
- Thanks.

237
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,300
[SIGHS]

238
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:20,460
What about our thing? We have
a lot of fact-finding to do

239
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,119
before I can get to stabbing.

240
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,570
No problem.

241
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,289
I know just who to handle it.

242
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,039
<i>You want me to what?</i>

243
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,340
Just find out who in the
castle hates Fairies.

244
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,580
Okay? And what they're doing to them.

245
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,299
And why Fairies in the first place?

246
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,210
And maybe talk to some Fairies,
get their side of things.

247
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,490
- Okay.
- And while you're at it...

248
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,219
anything else that seems important.

249
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,130
Okay, okay, okay.

250
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,610
No, um... That seems like a
lot of open-ended questions.

251
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,610
- Mm-hmm.
- I got this maid job

252
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,710
to be close to you guys,

253
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,250
and now you're deserting me? [CHUCKLES]

254
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,650
I want to stop an apocalypse too.

255
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,830
Every apocalypse-stopping mission

256
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,860
needs a maid on the outside.

257
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,870
It's a key staple in Earth movies.

258
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,030
Do you mean inside man?

259
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,739
'Cause that's more of
a heist movie thing.

260
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,080
- No, that's different.
- Okay.

261
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,210
Everyone knows

262
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,150
the "secret, sexy maid
on the outside" trope.

263
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,190
- Yeah?
- Josh has a film club.

264
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,420
- You should check it out.
- Huh.

265
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:17,920
Maid on the outside. Yeah.

266
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,679
So did your loony friend
say how to get moon brain?

267
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,560
From what we read, her rituals

268
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,070
are simple first-year Popper tuts.

269
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,600
But moon brain is...

270
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:32,189
the insanity you get from
extreme sleep deprivation.

271
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,770
Extreme, like a night partying,
or what are we talking about?

272
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,280
I wish.

273
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,859
Five nights without sleep,

274
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,080
and we can't use magic
to stay awake either.

275
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,449
Apparently, moon brain has
to come about naturally.

276
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,480
This is completely nuts.

277
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:47,290
Isn't the Harmonic whatever
happening in five nights?

278
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,460
Yes, so if we all start tonight,

279
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,370
we might actually have
a shot at stopping it.

280
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,480
Wait a minute. [LAUGHS]

281
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:55,299
Five nights without sleep is
gonna fuck us up royally.

282
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,299
Can we even cast if
we're that messed up?

283
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,839
Well, three of us have to.

284
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,670
Look, guys, I know it sucks,

285
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,370
but whoever can stay up for 132 hours

286
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,389
without sleep and not lose their shit...

287
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,560
gets to stop the apocalypse.

288
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,700
I don't know about you guys,
but I am doing great.

289
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,440
- _
- Coffee.

290
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,950
Where's our fearless leader?

291
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,550
- _
- She's taking a cold shower

292
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,580
to keep herself awake.

293
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,860
Third... fourth time this morning.

294
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:28,939
Well, I don't know about you guys,

295
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,100
but I am too excited to sleep.

296
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,760
I mean, we're doing it!

297
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,424
Is this, uh, helping
you find moon rocks?

298
00:11:35,425 --> 00:11:36,880
Mm.

299
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,820
No, this is helping us stay awake.

300
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:42,340
The moment I research,
I'm out like a light.

301
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,379
Know what might help?

302
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,709
If we make this party a
little more '80s themed.

303
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:48,120

304
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,750
Oh, I don't think we should.

305
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,759
If we ski the fresh
powder, know what I mean?

306
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,889
- Yeah, I get it.
- I mean cocaine.

307
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:56,260
Get me cocaine.

308
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,420
- I am not getting you cocaine.
- <i>Eliot.</i>

309
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,220
A five-day bender would
destroy your nose,

310
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,099
and could you imagine what that would do

311
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,110
to your sense of taste?

312
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,480
I get a full nine every night,

313
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,580
and I'm still a bitch.
This is gonna get real.

314
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,530
Hey, guys, come check this out.

00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,959
<i>[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC]</i>

316
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,709
I found something.

317
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,890
NASA brought back a bunch of moon rocks

318
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,080
from the Apollo missions.

319
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,970
We're stealing from NASA? Hell, yeah.

320
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,140
Mama's checking one more
off her bucket list.

321
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,790
Okay, we're not stealing from NASA.

322
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,010
I checked, it's impossible. I'm sorry.

323
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,688
But some of the rocks
that they brought back,

324
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:28,809
they gave out as gifts,
and they went missing.

325
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:31,250
About 180.

326
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,330
The ones they did find,

327
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,920
they found 'em in garages,

328
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:36,620
desk drawers, kids' bedrooms.
Just lying around.

329
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,939
People forgot about them,
but they're out there,

330
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,529
and I definitely think we can get one.

331
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:41,890
Okay, you guys do that.

332
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,680
I'm gonna go get some
stay-awake supplies.

333
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,449
I have a muffin recipe
with a special ingredient

334
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:48,699
that is guaranteed to keep
us alert for five days.

335
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,449
What is it? Meth?

336
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,940
Oh, excuse you.

337
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:54,499
It is a organic, locally-sourced

338
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,150
natural stimulant that got me
through every finals week,

339
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,379
and it is definitely not meth.

340
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,810
That's exactly what I would say

341
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,379
if I was trying to get us to take meth.

342
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,880
Mm-hmm.

You're taking retirement well.

344
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,530
I find that organization

345
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,900
helps bring a sense of stability
when one's feeling...

346
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,029
not stable.

347
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,230
Okay.

348
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:27,510
I need to find a Book
Depository that got moved.

349
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,869
It's in Hell's Kitchen,
that's all I know.

350
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,940
Library buildings are
enchanted to blend in

351
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:33,180
with their new environs
whenever they're relocated.

352
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,760
You'll have to go door-to-door,

353
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,620
find the building covered
