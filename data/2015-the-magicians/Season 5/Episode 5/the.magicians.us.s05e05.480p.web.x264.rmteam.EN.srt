1
00:00:06,915 --> 00:00:08,656
Previously,
on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,179
There's too much magic.

3
00:00:10,223 --> 00:00:13,574
Everything that I touch just...
it just grows like crazy.

4
00:00:14,227 --> 00:00:16,403
I'm gonna let your bullshit
slide on account of you

5
00:00:16,446 --> 00:00:19,841
so recently being possessed
by a homicidal monster.

6
00:00:19,884 --> 00:00:21,321
There was a blood worm scare,

7
00:00:21,364 --> 00:00:23,255
so the Library gave a lot
of hedges the Reed's Mark.

8
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,760
I found a spell to remove
the Marks in a Depository.

9
00:00:25,803 --> 00:00:28,371
- I get you're on a mission.
- One of you's got to jet.

10
00:00:28,415 --> 00:00:30,460
Either one of you
can hang for eternity.

11
00:00:30,504 --> 00:00:32,941
I've earned the right
to step off.

12
00:00:32,984 --> 00:00:34,856
We're here to study
with Mayakovsky.

13
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:36,771
I hate all of you.

14
00:00:36,814 --> 00:00:37,859
Professor?

15
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,950
"Best bitches."

16
00:00:41,993 --> 00:00:44,735
Wear this,
and you'll see what I see.

17
00:00:44,779 --> 00:00:46,563
I'm Clarion,
the goddess of melody.

18
00:00:46,607 --> 00:00:49,000
The way that you're imagining
the Harmonic Convergence

19
00:00:49,044 --> 00:00:50,698
isn't quite enough.

20
00:00:50,741 --> 00:00:53,527
When all the spells cast by
all the Magicians go haywire,

21
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:56,573
you're gonna get earthquakes,
starvation, plague.

22
00:00:56,617 --> 00:00:58,619
She didn't have time
to be delicate.

23
00:00:58,662 --> 00:01:00,490
You can't travel anymore.

24
00:01:00,534 --> 00:01:02,623
What exactly
are we looking for, sir?

25
00:01:02,666 --> 00:01:05,016
- Not what.
- Who.

26
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,410
- You two know each other?
- No.

27
00:01:07,454 --> 00:01:09,325
Well, your subjects
are rightly grateful.

28
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:10,544
For sending that letter?

29
00:01:10,587 --> 00:01:12,633
AKA that thing I totally
didn't do; you did.

30
00:01:12,676 --> 00:01:14,983
I was gonna let you die
for Fillory.

31
00:01:15,026 --> 00:01:16,767
The Convergence can be stopped.

32
00:01:16,811 --> 00:01:20,771
All you have to do is move...

33
00:01:20,815 --> 00:01:21,990
that.

34
00:01:24,384 --> 00:01:26,603
The Harmonic Convergence.

35
00:01:26,647 --> 00:01:30,259
- AKA the end of the world.
- Not necessarily.

36
00:01:30,303 --> 00:01:32,653
This constellation forms
a cosmic sigil

37
00:01:32,696 --> 00:01:34,872
that increases
magical intensity.

38
00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:37,527
It has happened in the past
without causing an apocalypse.

39
00:01:37,571 --> 00:01:39,312
But now there's surges of magic.

40
00:01:39,355 --> 00:01:42,532
So we get the disaster movie
Clarion was talking about.

41
00:01:42,576 --> 00:01:43,814
The Convergence will only occur

42
00:01:43,838 --> 00:01:45,796
during this perfect alignment.

43
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,408
If we move the moon
out of position...

44
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:50,540
No Convergence, no Circumstance,

45
00:01:50,584 --> 00:01:51,715
no apocalypse.

46
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,543
The moon is not just
a rock in space.

47
00:01:53,587 --> 00:01:55,502
It has certain properties.

48
00:01:55,545 --> 00:01:57,547
- Like?
- Magic doesn't work on it.

49
00:01:57,591 --> 00:01:59,897
Thanks to Magicians
casting haphazardly on it

50
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:02,291
for millennia, the moon
is now covered by a crust

51
00:02:02,335 --> 00:02:04,467
of spell debris,
blocking new spells.

52
00:02:04,511 --> 00:02:07,557
If we move any piece
out of place, no Convergence.

53
00:02:07,601 --> 00:02:09,994
Well, what if we just
moved Mars?

54
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:12,475
She said with a straight face.

55
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:14,782
The other pieces are planets.

56
00:02:14,825 --> 00:02:16,784
We can't move them
because they are, well,

57
00:02:16,827 --> 00:02:18,089
very big and far away.

58
00:02:18,133 --> 00:02:20,048
The moon is the only
celestial body

59
00:02:20,091 --> 00:02:21,615
we stand a chance of affecting.

60
00:02:21,658 --> 00:02:23,834
But won't that screw
with the Circumstances?

61
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:25,421
What will magic be like
when we're done?

62
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:26,750
Impossible to know.

63
00:02:26,794 --> 00:02:28,796
It will be a brand-new
Circumstance.

64
00:02:30,014 --> 00:02:33,061
But to get to that problem,
we need to solve this one.

65
00:02:33,104 --> 00:02:34,932
Good, well,
I hope you have some ideas,

66
00:02:34,976 --> 00:02:36,717
because we're striking out.

67
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,762
- I do.
- Consult the Lunatics.

68
00:02:40,024 --> 00:02:42,984
- The lunatics?
- Short for "Lunar Fanatics."

69
00:02:43,027 --> 00:02:45,334
In the Middle Ages,
people thought insanity

70
00:02:45,378 --> 00:02:47,336
was caused by changing phases
of the moon.

71
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,426
In fact, it was often a Lunatic
in the throes of worship.

72
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,429
They claimed to be able
to achieve a magical connection

73
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:55,779
with the moon and even under
some circumstances...

74
00:02:55,823 --> 00:02:57,128
move it.

75
00:02:57,172 --> 00:02:59,870
- Well, that sounds useful.
- Mm.

76
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:01,524
Well, if it's just branding,

77
00:03:01,568 --> 00:03:03,657
it means they're
not really crazy, right?

78
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,529
My dad always said that
they were batshit insane,

79
00:03:06,573 --> 00:03:08,705
and he married my mom,
so he had a pretty high bar

80
00:03:08,749 --> 00:03:10,185
for mental instability.

81
00:03:10,228 --> 00:03:13,406
Regardless, they know more
about the moon than anyone.

82
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:16,800
I believe that talking to them
is our only chance at success.

83
00:03:35,645 --> 00:03:36,951
What people don't understand

84
00:03:36,994 --> 00:03:38,735
is there is a skeleton
of the universe,

85
00:03:38,779 --> 00:03:40,041
but we are the bones.

86
00:03:40,084 --> 00:03:42,435
Oh, that's good to know.

87
00:03:42,478 --> 00:03:44,001
I am a humerus.

88
00:03:44,045 --> 00:03:46,743
You? Patella.

89
00:03:46,787 --> 00:03:48,702
We wanted to ask you
about the moon.

90
00:03:48,745 --> 00:03:50,834
Can we talk about it?

91
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:52,358
It... it?

92
00:03:53,576 --> 00:03:55,056
Her Lunacy...

93
00:03:56,449 --> 00:04:00,061
Identifies as she/her.

94
00:04:00,104 --> 00:04:02,672
- That's right.
- We knew that, right?

95
00:04:02,716 --> 00:04:04,718
- Of course.
- We know.

96
00:04:04,761 --> 00:04:07,677
If we wanted to move Her,
how could we do that?

97
00:04:07,721 --> 00:04:10,114
You don't move Her.

98
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:12,595
Okay, listen, Reba.

99
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:15,642
In just a few days, a whole lot
of people are going to die.

100
00:04:15,685 --> 00:04:16,904
That's a whole lot people

101
00:04:16,947 --> 00:04:18,490
that will never
get to worship the moon.

102
00:04:18,514 --> 00:04:20,864
They will never get
to know Her like you do.

103
00:04:20,908 --> 00:04:24,607
If She can help us save
all of those lives...

104
00:04:24,651 --> 00:04:27,218
imagine everyone
that will realize

105
00:04:27,262 --> 00:04:29,569
just how much
She deserves their love,

106
00:04:29,612 --> 00:04:30,961
their reverence.

107
00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:32,746
So will you help us?

108
00:04:34,748 --> 00:04:36,619
Just to be clear.

109
00:04:37,838 --> 00:04:40,231
You don't move Her.

110
00:04:40,275 --> 00:04:43,539
You ask Her to move.

111
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,020
And She won't let you speak to
Her unless you get moon brain.

112
00:04:46,063 --> 00:04:47,891
So one of us needs moon brain.

113
00:04:47,935 --> 00:04:50,894
- Not one of you.
- Three of you.

114
00:04:50,938 --> 00:04:53,506
A single Magician cannot
generate enough power

115
00:04:53,549 --> 00:04:54,898
to reach Her.

116
00:04:54,942 --> 00:04:56,683
So it's
a cooperative spell then.

117
00:04:56,726 --> 00:04:58,772
It is a sign of respect,
Kneecap,

118
00:04:58,815 --> 00:05:01,470
that allows you to see Her
as She truly is.

119
00:05:01,514 --> 00:05:04,168
If you have moon brain,
then you will see Her aura.

120
00:05:04,212 --> 00:05:06,103
Now it is red, but when you
perform the Dianic Ritual,

121
00:05:06,127 --> 00:05:07,520
Her aura will change.

122
00:05:07,563 --> 00:05:09,217
If it is yellow,
She is considering.

123
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,655
If it is green,
She is listening.

124
00:05:12,699 --> 00:05:15,658
Only then may you ask Her

125
00:05:15,702 --> 00:05:16,877
to move.

126
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,226
Red, yellow, green.

127
00:05:18,269 --> 00:05:20,228
The guy who invented
the stoplight,

128
00:05:20,271 --> 00:05:22,491
was he a Lunatic too?

129
00:05:22,535 --> 00:05:24,928
- William Potts?
- Yeah.

130
00:05:24,972 --> 00:05:26,756
Oh, cool.

131
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,019
All three Magicians
must perform the ritual

132
00:05:29,063 --> 00:05:31,500
until the moon is listening.

133
00:05:31,544 --> 00:05:35,069
A warning: once Her aura is
green, She may choose to listen

134
00:05:35,112 --> 00:05:37,593
to anyone who calls to Her,
so be ready.

135
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,987
You must choose one,
the strongest among you,

136
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:43,773
to speak to Her, like the old
Lunatics taught us to.

137
00:05:43,817 --> 00:05:45,732
For this second part,
however, there is a price.

138
00:05:45,775 --> 00:05:48,561
- A price, like blood?
- It is like blood to Her.

139
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:52,826
You will need a piece of Her.
A sacrifice.

140
00:05:52,869 --> 00:05:54,741
A piece?

141
00:05:54,784 --> 00:05:56,960
- Or like a moon rock?
- Yes.

142
00:05:57,004 --> 00:05:59,180
But be aware,

143
00:05:59,223 --> 00:06:01,225
this will destroy it,

144
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:04,011
so don't use your favorite one.

145
00:06:05,186 --> 00:06:07,667
This is the price
of speaking to the moon.

146
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,799
Just a few more questions.

147
00:06:09,843 --> 00:06:12,933
What is moon brain,
and how do we get it?

148
00:06:12,976 --> 00:06:16,066
- Everyone line up.
- Pudding time!

149
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,112
Lovely to speak to you.

150
00:06:18,155 --> 00:06:20,027
You too, Kneecap.

151
00:06:25,032 --> 00:06:28,601
You ever just spin a globe,
stick your finger down,

152
00:06:28,644 --> 00:06:30,646
see where it lands?

153
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,649
It's almost always water,
because, well, duh.

154
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:36,696
Earth is mostly water,
but sometimes it's the Sahara,

155
00:06:36,739 --> 00:06:39,699
sometimes the Urals.

156
00:06:39,742 --> 00:06:42,702
That's what you'd be doing
if you tried to travel.

157
00:06:42,745 --> 00:06:45,879
Only instead of the globe,
the multiverse,

158
00:06:45,922 --> 00:06:48,664
which is bigger and deadlier.

159
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,231
Afraid you'd say that.

160
00:06:50,274 --> 00:06:51,861
I looked at everything
I could think of,

161
00:06:51,885 --> 00:06:53,669
magical and medical.

162
00:06:53,713 --> 00:06:55,715
Nada.
You're grounded.

163
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,345
All right, well,
since I ain't traveling,

164
00:06:58,369 --> 00:06:59,675
I should probably step down.

165
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,131
Uh, if you're offering
your resignation,

166
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:02,243
I don't accept.

167
00:07:02,286 --> 00:07:04,027
- Not offering.
- Stating.

168
00:07:04,071 --> 00:07:06,203
With Dean Fogg out indefinitely,

169
00:07:06,247 --> 00:07:09,163
Brakebills has instituted
our Dean Vanishment Protocol.

170
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:11,905
Of course, that's a thing here.

171
00:07:11,948 --> 00:07:14,255
Yeah, and uh...

172
00:07:14,298 --> 00:07:15,865
That makes me
acting Dean Lipson.

173
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:17,214
There's no instruction manual,

174
00:07:17,258 --> 00:07:18,912
so I'm kinda dean-ing
on the fly here,

175
00:07:18,955 --> 00:07:20,261
but one thing I do know

176
00:07:20,304 --> 00:07:22,045
is losing a professor
who was disabled

177
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:24,047
on school grounds
ain't happening.

178
00:07:24,091 --> 00:07:26,615
I mean, the optics
would be pure shitflakes.

179
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:30,576
So your contract
will be honored and enforced.

180
00:07:31,402 --> 00:07:33,840
Oh, also.

181
00:07:35,406 --> 00:07:36,973
We need a new Welters coach.

182
00:07:39,933 --> 00:07:42,718
I've been on the inside,
and I'm telling you

183
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,285
it's a goddamn goose-stepping,

184
00:07:44,328 --> 00:07:47,070
Fairy-snatching,
ethnic cleansing Gestapo.

185
00:07:47,114 --> 00:07:49,246
To be fair,
the ethnic cleansing happened

186
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:51,205
after the Dark King left, so...

187
00:07:51,248 --> 00:07:53,163
He's innocent
because he delegates?

188
00:07:53,207 --> 00:07:54,861
No, that's not what I'm saying.

189
00:07:54,904 --> 00:07:57,080
Someone in this castle ordered
the hunt on that Fairy.

190
00:07:57,124 --> 00:07:58,275
It could have been
the Dark King,

191
00:07:58,299 --> 00:07:59,779
but if it was someone else,

192
00:07:59,822 --> 00:08:01,737
killing Seb might just make
things worse.

193
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:06,960
So we have to find out who
before we... coup.

194
00:08:08,352 --> 00:08:11,007
I just wanna stab someone.

195
00:08:11,051 --> 00:08:13,227
I haven't heard you
this bloodthirsty in...

196
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,838
well, not that long,
but still, it's notable.

197
00:08:15,882 --> 00:08:18,275
Maybe I'm a bit on edge.

198
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,190
Josh keeps wanting to talk.

199
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:21,385
You mean about how you wanted

200
00:08:21,409 --> 00:08:22,473
to leave him in the past to die?

201
00:08:22,497 --> 00:08:24,934
Yeah, that.

202
00:08:24,978 --> 00:08:27,067
So far, I'm doing a good job
of avoiding him,

203
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,851
but eventually
he's gonna sneak...

204
00:08:28,895 --> 00:08:30,026
Guys.

205
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,898
- Hey, what's up?
- 'Sup?

206
00:08:31,941 --> 00:08:33,943
First off,
kudos on the hiding spot.

207
00:08:33,987 --> 00:08:36,729
- It took me forever to find you.
- Pretty busy here, Josh.

208
00:08:36,772 --> 00:08:37,817
You're busy?

209
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,924
I just got promoted
to head chef.

210
00:08:38,948 --> 00:08:40,994
- Oh, congratulations.
- Thank you.

211
00:08:41,037 --> 00:08:42,996
But I'm about to bail
on a state dinner

212
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,476
and leave it to my incompetent
sous-chef because...

213
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,304
Apocalypse! Now!

214
00:08:47,348 --> 00:08:49,306
Josh, would you just give it up?

215
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,023
He keeps trying to get us
to join his film club,

216
00:08:51,047 --> 00:08:52,807
which I told him would
never work on a planet

217
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,790
with no electricity or taste.

218
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:58,011
- Uh, no, uh, sorry.
- This one's just a little shy.

219
00:08:58,054 --> 00:08:59,447
It... it's okay, buddy.

220
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:03,016
- Help us stop the...
- Apocalypse! Now!

221
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:06,062
- Oh.
- We need to get back to Earth.

222
00:09:06,106 --> 00:09:07,760
Margo, our talk
will have to wait

223
00:09:07,803 --> 00:09:09,457
till after we save the world.

224
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,764
Oh, but then I have
my nephew's bar mitzvah.

225
00:09:11,807 --> 00:09:13,374
So after that?

226
00:09:14,549 --> 00:09:16,159
- Mazel.
- Thanks.

227
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:19,380
What about our thing?

228
00:09:19,423 --> 00:09:21,425
We have a lot
of fact-finding to do

229
00:09:21,469 --> 00:09:23,123
before I can get to stabbing.

230
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,515
No problem.

231
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:26,256
I know just who to handle it.

232
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,041
You want me to what?

233
00:09:28,084 --> 00:09:31,261
Just find out who
in the castle hates Fairies.

234
00:09:31,305 --> 00:09:33,524
Okay?
And what they're doing to them.

235
00:09:33,568 --> 00:09:35,265
And why Fairies
in the first place?

236
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:38,181
And maybe talk to some Fairies,
get their side of things.

237
00:09:38,225 --> 00:09:40,444
- Okay.
- And while you're at it...

238
00:09:40,488 --> 00:09:42,882
anything else
that seems important.

239
00:09:42,925 --> 00:09:44,753
- Okay, okay, okay.
- No, um...

240
00:09:44,797 --> 00:09:46,252
That seems like a lot
of open-ended questions.

241
00:09:46,276 --> 00:09:47,234
Mm-hmm.

242
00:09:47,277 --> 00:09:48,626
I got this maid job

243
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,281
to be close to you guys,
and now you're deserting me?

244
00:09:52,805 --> 00:09:54,763
I want to stop
an apocalypse too.

245
00:09:55,808 --> 00:09:57,766
Every
apocalypse-stopping mission

246
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,899
needs a maid on the outside.

247
00:09:59,942 --> 00:10:01,770
It's a key staple
in Earth movies.

248
00:10:01,814 --> 00:10:03,032
Do you mean inside man?

249
00:10:03,076 --> 00:10:04,817
'Cause that's more
of a heist movie thing.

250
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,993
- No, that's different.
- Okay.

251
00:10:07,036 --> 00:10:08,472
Everyone knows

252
00:10:08,516 --> 00:10:11,084
the "secret, sexy maid
on the outside" trope.

253
00:10:11,127 --> 00:10:12,955
- Yeah?
- Josh has a film club.

254
00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:15,349
- You should check it out.
- Huh.

255
00:10:15,392 --> 00:10:18,308
Maid on the outside.
Yeah.

256
00:10:21,268 --> 00:10:23,792
So did your loony friend
say how to get moon brain?

257
00:10:23,836 --> 00:10:25,576
From what we read, her rituals

258
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,970
are simple first-year
Popper tuts.

259
00:10:28,014 --> 00:10:29,537
But moon brain is...

260
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,193
the insanity you get from
extreme sleep deprivation.

261
00:10:33,236 --> 00:10:34,803
Extreme, like a night partying,

262
00:10:34,847 --> 00:10:35,867
or what are we talking about?

263
00:10:35,891 --> 00:10:37,197
I wish.

264
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,894
Five nights without sleep,

265
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,983
and we can't use magic
to stay awake either.

266
00:10:41,027 --> 00:10:43,420
Apparently, moon brain
has to come about naturally.

267
00:10:43,464 --> 00:10:45,422
This is completely nuts.

268
00:10:45,466 --> 00:10:48,208
Isn't the Harmonic whatever
happening in five nights?

269
00:10:48,251 --> 00:10:50,427
Yes, so if we all start tonight,

270
00:10:50,471 --> 00:10:52,342
we might actually have
a shot at stopping it.

271
00:10:52,386 --> 00:10:53,779
Wait a minute.

272
00:10:53,822 --> 00:10:56,259
Five nights without sleep
is gonna fuck us up royally.

273
00:10:56,303 --> 00:10:59,262
Can we even cast
if we're that messed up?

274
00:10:59,306 --> 00:11:00,916
Well, three of us have to.

275
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,613
Look, guys, I know it sucks,

276
00:11:02,657 --> 00:11:07,357
but whoever can stay up
for 132 hours

277
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:10,360
without sleep
and not lose their shit...

278
00:11:10,404 --> 00:11:12,580
gets to stop the apocalypse.

279
00:11:17,591 --> 00:11:21,377
I don't know about you guys,
but I am doing great.

280
00:11:22,378 --> 00:11:23,336
Coffee.

281
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:24,729
Where's our fearless leader?

282
00:11:24,772 --> 00:11:27,470
She's taking a cold shower
to keep herself awake.

283
00:11:27,514 --> 00:11:29,647
Third... fourth time this morning.

284
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,736
Well, I don't know
about you guys,

285
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:33,868
but I am too excited to sleep.

286
00:11:33,912 --> 00:11:35,653
I mean, we're doing it!

287
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:38,307
Is this, uh,
helping you find moon rocks?

288
00:11:38,351 --> 00:11:39,657
Mm.

289
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,616
No, this is helping us
stay awake.

290
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,836
The moment I research,
I'm out like a light.

291
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:46,272
Know what might help?

292
00:11:46,315 --> 00:11:48,578
If we make this party
a little more '80s themed.

293
00:11:48,622 --> 00:11:50,537
Eliot.

294
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,495
Oh, I don't think we should.

295
00:11:52,539 --> 00:11:54,628
If we ski the fresh powder,
know what I mean?

296
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,413
- Yeah, I get it.
- I mean cocaine.

297
00:11:57,457 --> 00:11:59,217
- Get me cocaine.
- I am not getting you cocaine.

298
00:11:59,241 --> 00:12:01,417
Eliot.

299
00:12:01,461 --> 00:12:03,178
A five-day bender
would destroy your nose,

300
00:12:03,202 --> 00:12:04,769
and could you imagine
what that would do

301
00:12:04,812 --> 00:12:05,857
to your sense of taste?

302
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,336
I get a full nine every night,

303
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,337
and I'm still a bitch.

304
00:12:08,381 --> 00:12:09,469
This is gonna get real.

305
00:12:09,512 --> 00:12:11,297
Hey, guys, come check this out.

306
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:16,563
I found something.

307
00:12:16,606 --> 00:12:18,434
NASA brought back
a bunch of moon rocks

308
00:12:18,478 --> 00:12:19,697
from the Apollo missions.

309
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,655
- We're stealing from NASA?
- Hell, yeah.

310
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,875
Mama's checking one more
off her bucket list.

311
00:12:23,918 --> 00:12:25,485
Okay, we're not stealing
from NASA.

312
00:12:25,528 --> 00:12:27,748
I checked, it's impossible.
I'm sorry.

313
00:12:27,792 --> 00:12:29,465
But some of the rocks
that they brought back,

314
00:12:29,489 --> 00:12:31,665
they gave out as gifts,
and they went missing.

315
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,972
About 180.

316
00:12:34,015 --> 00:12:35,277
The ones they did find,

317
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:36,670
they found 'em in garages,

318
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,367
desk drawers, kids' bedrooms.

319
00:12:38,411 --> 00:12:39,368
Just lying around.

320
00:12:39,412 --> 00:12:40,456
People forgot about them,

321
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,762
but they're out there,

322
00:12:41,806 --> 00:12:43,416
and I definitely think
we can get one.

323
00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:44,678
Okay, you guys do that.

324
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,506
I'm gonna go get some
stay-awake supplies.

325
00:12:46,549 --> 00:12:49,335
I have a muffin recipe
with a special ingredient

326
00:12:49,378 --> 00:12:51,554
that is guaranteed to keep us
alert for five days.

327
00:12:51,598 --> 00:12:53,339
- What is it?
- Meth?

328
00:12:53,382 --> 00:12:54,732
Oh, excuse you.

329
00:12:54,775 --> 00:12:57,386
It is a organic, locally-sourced

330
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:00,825
natural stimulant that got me
through every finals week,

331
00:13:00,868 --> 00:13:02,304
and it is definitely not meth.

332
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:03,653
That's exactly what I would say

333
00:13:03,697 --> 00:13:05,307
if I was trying
to get us to take meth.

334
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:06,744
Mm-hmm.

335
00:13:16,318 --> 00:13:18,233
You're taking retirement well.

336
00:13:18,277 --> 00:13:20,279
I find that organization

337
00:13:20,322 --> 00:13:23,673
helps bring a sense of
stability when one's feeling...

338
00:13:23,717 --> 00:13:24,805
not stable.

339
00:13:24,849 --> 00:13:25,850
Okay.

340
00:13:27,547 --> 00:13:30,419
I need to find a Book
Depository that got moved.

341
00:13:30,463 --> 00:13:31,745
It's in Hell's Kitchen,
that's all I know.

342
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,727
Library buildings
are enchanted to blend in

343
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,947
with their new environs
whenever they're relocated.

344
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,600
You'll have to go door-to-door,

345
00:13:37,644 --> 00:13:39,515
find the building covered in
Library wards.

346
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:40,908
- Great.
- Let's go.

347
00:13:40,952 --> 00:13:43,519
You're abandoning your friends?

348
00:13:43,563 --> 00:13:46,479
They have enough people
for a rock search.

349
00:13:46,522 --> 00:13:48,544
Plus, whatever's in Josh's
muffins doesn't sound like

350
00:13:48,568 --> 00:13:51,353
something a person
in recovery should be taking.

351
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:52,833
I need to find the Depository

352
00:13:52,877 --> 00:13:55,314
before we move the moon
and screw up magic.

353
00:13:55,357 --> 00:13:58,360
Right now, we have enough
to remove Reed's Marks.

354
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:01,276
After, like you said, who knows?

355
00:14:02,364 --> 00:14:04,410
I'm not sure
I'd be much use to you.

356
00:14:04,453 --> 00:14:05,890
Out in the world.

357
00:14:05,933 --> 00:14:08,762
The building's impenetrable
on a good day.

358
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,809
Unless you're a Librarian who
knows the security protocols.

359
00:14:13,114 --> 00:14:14,594
I don't know...

360
00:14:14,637 --> 00:14:18,293
I'm not asking for your help.

361
00:14:18,337 --> 00:14:21,862
I'm giving you a chance to fix
your massive, massive mistake.

362
00:14:21,906 --> 00:14:23,908
Mm.

363
00:14:23,951 --> 00:14:25,779
Let's go.

364
00:14:41,969 --> 00:14:43,666
High King Fen?

365
00:14:44,493 --> 00:14:45,799
Fairy!

366
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,802
Keep the High King talk quiet.

367
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,325
I'm undercover.

368
00:14:50,369 --> 00:14:52,023
- You will come with me.
- Oh!

369
00:14:52,066 --> 00:14:53,633
That... that is so great.

370
00:14:53,676 --> 00:14:55,591
I have a lot
of questions for you.

371
00:14:55,635 --> 00:14:57,898
Some I don't even know
why I'm asking.

372
00:14:57,942 --> 00:14:59,726
They said you would fear me.

373
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:01,336
Funny thing.

374
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,512
I am on a Fairy quest.

375
00:15:03,556 --> 00:15:07,516
See, I'm a maid on the outside.

376
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,606
Super-secret.
Super-sexy.

377
00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:14,915
Follow me,
Maid on the Outside Fen.

378
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,134
Good.

379
00:15:16,177 --> 00:15:17,526
Okay.

380
00:15:24,751 --> 00:15:26,709
- Guess what I found.
- You found a moon rock?

381
00:15:26,753 --> 00:15:28,494
I found a moon rock.

382
00:15:28,537 --> 00:15:30,148
And those muffins smell amazing.

383
00:15:30,191 --> 00:15:31,236
Thank you.

384
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,760
Now all we have to do
is stay awake.

385
00:15:33,803 --> 00:15:35,501
You know what helps me
stay awake?

386
00:15:35,544 --> 00:15:36,502
What's that?

387
00:15:36,545 --> 00:15:38,983
An open, naked conversation

388
00:15:39,026 --> 00:15:40,680
about our relationship.

389
00:15:41,986 --> 00:15:45,119
I wanna tell you about
all my repressed emotions.

390
00:15:47,556 --> 00:15:49,863
One by one.

391
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,778
Oh, baby.

392
00:15:51,821 --> 00:15:53,823
Josh.

393
00:15:53,867 --> 00:15:56,565
Josh.

394
00:15:56,609 --> 00:15:57,653
Josh!

395
00:15:58,741 --> 00:16:00,395
Josh!

396
00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:02,920
- Oh, no.
- Josh!

397
00:16:04,051 --> 00:16:05,835
Oh, shit.

398
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:07,750
Oh, shit!

399
00:16:10,753 --> 00:16:12,538
We leave you for one afternoon,

400
00:16:12,581 --> 00:16:13,974
and you fuck us completely.

401
00:16:14,018 --> 00:16:15,933
I'm sorry, guys.

402
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:18,979
I sat down for one minute
because I never fall asleep

403
00:16:19,023 --> 00:16:20,807
when I have
something in the oven.

404
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,852
Well, congratulations.

405
00:16:22,896 --> 00:16:24,942
This is a milestone for you.

406
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:26,073
Hey, guys.

407
00:16:26,117 --> 00:16:27,814
Hope you had better luck
than we did.

408
00:16:27,857 --> 00:16:30,860
Nope, we portal-hopped
every lead we had.

409
00:16:30,904 --> 00:16:33,124
The closest thing we found
was a chunk of old concrete

410
00:16:33,167 --> 00:16:35,648
with the word "moon"
written on it in Sharpie.

411
00:16:35,691 --> 00:16:36,866
Those rocks are gone.

412
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:37,998
But we did come home

413
00:16:38,042 --> 00:16:40,000
to find Josh
sleeping peacefully.

414
00:16:40,044 --> 00:16:42,133
I'm going
to assume your rudeness

415
00:16:42,176 --> 00:16:44,613
is because sleep deprivation
makes you irritable.

416
00:16:44,657 --> 00:16:46,093
- Sure.
- Assume that.

417
00:16:46,137 --> 00:16:47,965
Yeah, I get it.

418
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:50,184
I'm gonna have to staple
my eyes open; this is rough.

419
00:16:50,228 --> 00:16:53,187
- No one else sleeps.
- We have four nights.

420
00:16:53,231 --> 00:16:55,755
We need one rock lead
to pan out.

421
00:16:55,798 --> 00:16:57,191
But if the spell burns them up,

422
00:16:57,235 --> 00:16:58,976
what if we can't find any rocks

423
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,934
because the Lunatics
used them all?

424
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,676
What if there's no more
moon rocks on Earth?

425
00:17:03,719 --> 00:17:05,199
Just sayin',

426
00:17:05,243 --> 00:17:08,072
we could celebrate the Harmonic
Convergence in Fillory.

427
00:17:08,115 --> 00:17:10,770
It's a little dystopian
at the mo',

428
00:17:10,813 --> 00:17:12,511
but on the plus,
their weekend forecast

429
00:17:12,554 --> 00:17:14,121
doesn't call for an apocalypse.

430
00:17:17,298 --> 00:17:19,648
Look, guys,

431
00:17:19,692 --> 00:17:22,521
if you're looking for some
sort of inspirational speech

432
00:17:22,564 --> 00:17:25,480
on why you should
stay and fight,

433
00:17:25,524 --> 00:17:28,092
I can't help you.

434
00:17:28,135 --> 00:17:30,224
It's gonna suck,
and even if we do succeed,

435
00:17:30,268 --> 00:17:32,531
which we might not,

436
00:17:32,574 --> 00:17:35,621
it's not like we're gonna
get any credit.

437
00:17:35,664 --> 00:17:38,015
The world ends, I end with it,

438
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:41,192
knowing that I did
everything I could,

439
00:17:41,235 --> 00:17:44,586
because I won't be able
to live with myself otherwise.

440
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,110
Julia's right.

441
00:17:46,153 --> 00:17:49,156
She really does suck
at inspirational speeches.

442
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:54,161
But also that we should
save the world.

443
00:17:54,205 --> 00:17:55,162
I'm with you.

444
00:17:55,206 --> 00:17:56,816
So am I.

445
00:17:56,859 --> 00:17:58,252
Me too.

446
00:17:58,296 --> 00:17:59,732
I'm in.

447
00:17:59,775 --> 00:18:02,082
And my axe!

448
00:18:04,693 --> 00:18:07,000
- Really? No?
- No.

449
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,133
Should've led with,
"You have my bow."

450
00:18:09,176 --> 00:18:10,134
- Mm-hmm.
- Nope.

451
00:18:10,177 --> 00:18:11,309
Josh,

452
00:18:11,352 --> 00:18:13,224
put some fresh
meth muffins in the oven.

453
00:18:13,267 --> 00:18:15,791
Again, not meth.

454
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,888
- Hey!
- No droopy eyes on my watch.

455
00:18:26,715 --> 00:18:29,022
One more.

456
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,937
I'm good now.

457
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,938
I ain't.

458
00:18:31,981 --> 00:18:35,550
Oh, well, right on cue.

459
00:18:35,594 --> 00:18:39,032
I tried something new
this round.

460
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:43,080
A hint of lavender
and goji berry.

461
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:44,864
How we doin', Captain?

462
00:18:44,907 --> 00:18:46,909
Oh, you know, 12 hours
till the end of the world,

463
00:18:46,953 --> 00:18:48,563
and it's like we're still

464
00:18:48,607 --> 00:18:50,174
grasping for needles
in a hay straw.

465
00:18:50,217 --> 00:18:52,698
Fun. Okay.

466
00:18:52,741 --> 00:18:54,874
Probably not the best question
for morale,

467
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:57,790
but as the only person here
who's slept this week,

468
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:00,706
we have 12 hours and zero leads.

469
00:19:00,749 --> 00:19:03,143
Is waiting here to die
really the best option?

470
00:19:03,187 --> 00:19:05,580
When are we gonna give
Margo's idea another think?

471
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,213
Guys, I can't trust
my brain right now,

472
00:19:10,237 --> 00:19:12,196
but this seems like
it could be relevant.

473
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:15,286
I think this guy
has a moon rock.

474
00:19:15,329 --> 00:19:16,939
- Oren Westbrook.
- Why do I know him?

475
00:19:16,983 --> 00:19:18,265
Because you're not
a cave person.

476
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:20,943
He invented the tech
for pop-up ads,

477
00:19:20,987 --> 00:19:23,598
and he invented the tech
to block pop-up ads.

478
00:19:23,642 --> 00:19:25,339
Ever since, he's just been
a weird rich guy

479
00:19:25,383 --> 00:19:27,646
doing weird-rich-guy shit.

480
00:19:27,689 --> 00:19:30,083
I heard his blood boy
has his own blood boy.

481
00:19:31,998 --> 00:19:34,261
Ew, what's on his eye?

482
00:19:34,305 --> 00:19:36,611
That's the same tattoo
that Reba had.

483
00:19:36,655 --> 00:19:38,744
Julia, I think he's a Lunatic.

484
00:19:38,787 --> 00:19:40,876
All right.

485
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,923
So in order to save the world,
all we have to do

486
00:19:43,966 --> 00:19:48,623
is convince some eccentric
billionaire with armed guards

487
00:19:48,667 --> 00:19:51,844
to give up something he
probably considers to be, like,

488
00:19:51,887 --> 00:19:53,367
his Holy Grail.

489
00:19:53,411 --> 00:19:56,892
All while we're so tired
we can't see straight.

490
00:19:56,936 --> 00:19:59,243
Pshh, no sweat.

491
00:20:06,131 --> 00:20:07,219
Marvelous.

492
00:20:07,262 --> 00:20:09,482
How did you handle the pain?

493
00:20:10,352 --> 00:20:12,398
Knowing it would bring
me closer to Her Lunacy

494
00:20:12,441 --> 00:20:14,835
helped me get through it.

495
00:20:16,097 --> 00:20:18,317
Same as when I got mine.

496
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,232
That and a handful of opiates.

497
00:20:26,064 --> 00:20:27,258
Hey, sorry about the security.

498
00:20:27,282 --> 00:20:28,501
I hope you guys understand.

499
00:20:28,544 --> 00:20:30,981
Ah, please, you can't
let in every Lunatic.

500
00:20:31,025 --> 00:20:32,244
Some people are crazy.

501
00:20:34,289 --> 00:20:36,161
Eliot.

502
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:41,079
Oh, wow,
you guys really look awful.

503
00:20:41,122 --> 00:20:42,080
What?

504
00:20:42,123 --> 00:20:43,081
Eliot...

505
00:20:43,124 --> 00:20:44,256
Your sunken eyes!

506
00:20:44,299 --> 00:20:45,257
Let me out.

507
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,997
Preparing for moon brain?

508
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:49,435
The Harmonic Convergence.

509
00:20:49,478 --> 00:20:51,350
Mm!
Yeah, baby.

510
00:20:51,393 --> 00:20:53,047
I'm celebrating too.

511
00:20:53,091 --> 00:20:55,832
I'm gonna have a few friends
over for a party.

512
00:20:58,313 --> 00:20:59,619
Uh, El?

513
00:20:59,662 --> 00:21:01,360
Eliot?

514
00:21:01,403 --> 00:21:03,144
Eliot, you good?

515
00:21:03,188 --> 00:21:05,277
- Yeah, yea... yeah.
- Yeah.

516
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,583
Just can't wait to see
this amazing moon rock.

517
00:21:07,627 --> 00:21:09,194
Don't worry.

518
00:21:09,237 --> 00:21:12,849
You both will experience Her.

519
00:21:26,124 --> 00:21:28,387
What a cozy little nightmare.

520
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,302
I might need you to punch me
to stay awake.

521
00:21:30,345 --> 00:21:31,303
Gotcha.

522
00:21:31,346 --> 00:21:32,652
Isn't She wondrous?

523
00:21:32,695 --> 00:21:33,653
Yeah, definitely.

524
00:21:33,696 --> 00:21:34,891
Think we can turn on the lights

525
00:21:34,915 --> 00:21:36,569
and turn off the yoga music?

526
00:21:36,612 --> 00:21:40,181
You got this
from the moon... how?

527
00:21:40,225 --> 00:21:41,574
I went.

528
00:21:41,617 --> 00:21:44,142
You just went to the moon
like it was Coney Island?

529
00:21:44,185 --> 00:21:46,492
Yeah, actually,
it was pretty tough.

530
00:21:46,535 --> 00:21:49,234
To be honest, I was trying
to impress someone.

531
00:21:49,277 --> 00:21:52,454
But in the end,
our souls did not connect.

532
00:21:53,368 --> 00:21:55,327
Yeah, we need to ask a favor.

533
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:58,243
For my fellow Lunatics,
I would move Heaven and Earth.

534
00:21:58,286 --> 00:21:59,940
About that...

535
00:21:59,983 --> 00:22:01,918
Yeah, look, we know
this rock is special to you...

536
00:22:01,942 --> 00:22:04,249
- Super special.
- But we need it.

537
00:22:04,292 --> 00:22:06,903
To move Her.
Hence the moon brain.

538
00:22:06,947 --> 00:22:08,446
You do know what that
would do, right?

539
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,144
Yes, but it's a matter
of life and death.

540
00:22:10,168 --> 00:22:11,604
We can stop
the Harmonic Convergence

541
00:22:11,647 --> 00:22:14,041
if we can hold the moon
out of position long enough.

542
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:15,042
Why?

543
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:16,237
Because it's going to cause

544
00:22:16,261 --> 00:22:17,697
worldwide destruction.

545
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,178
Magic will become so powerful,
it'll be apocalyptic.

546
00:22:20,221 --> 00:22:21,353
I mean, it's not like

547
00:22:21,396 --> 00:22:24,007
it's gonna wipe out
all life on Earth.

548
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,226
Just some.

549
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,272
You know exactly
how bad it's going to get,

550
00:22:27,315 --> 00:22:28,751
don't you?

551
00:22:28,795 --> 00:22:30,425
What, are you planning to
profit off this or something?

552
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:32,233
I'm planning to use my resources

553
00:22:32,277 --> 00:22:33,539
to help the world recover.

554
00:22:33,582 --> 00:22:35,236
Now, I'm an entrepreneurial
spirit.

555
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,195
I can't help but make money.

556
00:22:37,238 --> 00:22:38,239
Now, I do think that

557
00:22:38,283 --> 00:22:40,372
the moon brain
is getting to you.

558
00:22:40,415 --> 00:22:42,112
Unless...

559
00:22:44,376 --> 00:22:48,075
Mm, your eye tattoo
is illusion magic.

560
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:50,033
You're no Lunatic at all.

561
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,166
I'll have my guards
escort you out.

562
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:55,082
- Let's go, El.
- We tried.

563
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:57,084
Happens all the time.

564
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:07,268
- Get it?
- All of it.

565
00:23:08,313 --> 00:23:09,444
We have a problem.

566
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:11,011
So it's just security cameras

567
00:23:11,054 --> 00:23:12,249
until we get
to the moon rock room,

568
00:23:12,273 --> 00:23:13,970
and that's where it gets tough.

569
00:23:14,014 --> 00:23:16,190
One way in, one way out.

570
00:23:16,234 --> 00:23:18,453
I mean, if we get caught,
we're trapped.

571
00:23:19,585 --> 00:23:22,022
Guys. Guys!

572
00:23:23,328 --> 00:23:26,200
Thanks!

573
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,770
So... the rock.

574
00:23:30,813 --> 00:23:33,425
Whole lotta wards around it,
nothing we can't get past,

575
00:23:33,468 --> 00:23:35,644
except for the one
on the rock itself.

576
00:23:35,688 --> 00:23:38,778
It's... well, it's a bond
that we've never seen before,

577
00:23:38,821 --> 00:23:40,562
put there by Mayakovsky.

578
00:23:40,606 --> 00:23:42,738
Well, that can't be right.

579
00:23:42,782 --> 00:23:44,392
Oren just got the rock.

580
00:23:44,436 --> 00:23:46,002
And didn't you say the last time

581
00:23:46,046 --> 00:23:48,570
you saw Mayakovsky,
he was basically senile?

582
00:23:48,614 --> 00:23:50,311
Yeah, well,
I guess he got better.

583
00:23:50,355 --> 00:23:52,313
I mean, he...
he put his signature

584
00:23:52,357 --> 00:23:53,682
into the lattice work
of the spell.

585
00:23:53,706 --> 00:23:54,663
You can't miss it.

586
00:23:54,707 --> 00:23:56,143
It's the most amazing,

587
00:23:56,186 --> 00:23:58,276
most narcissistic thing
I've ever seen.

588
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:01,235
Mm.

589
00:24:02,715 --> 00:24:05,457
- Hey, Eliot?
- Hm?

590
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,111
- Can I talk to you for a sec?
- Yeah.

591
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,678
I said I'm fine.

592
00:24:11,419 --> 00:24:15,031
I have been awake for
thousands of hours straight.

593
00:24:15,075 --> 00:24:16,772
Look, I saw your moment
back there,

594
00:24:16,816 --> 00:24:18,513
and I think I might
know what's up.

595
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:21,560
You think you do, but you don't.

596
00:24:23,388 --> 00:24:26,347
Okay, so the first
two nights, no sleep,

597
00:24:26,391 --> 00:24:28,044
things got
a little weird, right?

598
00:24:28,088 --> 00:24:31,047
Like picking up my phone
to call Quentin.

599
00:24:31,091 --> 00:24:33,093
You know, I must've done that
like five times.

600
00:24:34,312 --> 00:24:38,141
But then my brain
crossed over into darker...

601
00:24:39,752 --> 00:24:42,450
Here's the deal.

602
00:24:42,494 --> 00:24:45,366
When the Sister was in me,

603
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:46,846
I remember everything.

604
00:24:46,889 --> 00:24:49,544
Every bloody second of it.

605
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:52,068
And usually,
I'm good at pushing it away,

606
00:24:52,112 --> 00:24:54,593
but right now...

607
00:24:54,636 --> 00:24:57,770
it is like a constant slideshow
in the background.

608
00:24:57,813 --> 00:25:00,599
Not fun. El.

609
00:25:00,642 --> 00:25:03,428
The Monster was
in you for months.

610
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:06,735
Well, it was different.

611
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:10,435
People have
different experiences.

612
00:25:10,478 --> 00:25:13,263
All that time was just
one big nap to me,

613
00:25:13,307 --> 00:25:15,657
which... sounds so good
right now.

614
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:19,661
I don't know
why you're lying to me.

615
00:25:19,705 --> 00:25:21,315
Or anyone.

616
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:24,666
I don't know why
you're accusing me of lying.

617
00:25:26,189 --> 00:25:27,800
Okay.

618
00:25:27,843 --> 00:25:30,542
Neither of us have the
bandwidth for this right now,

619
00:25:30,585 --> 00:25:32,457
and I don't trust you.

620
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,502
I don't.

621
00:25:34,546 --> 00:25:36,896
But if you ever
do decide to talk,

622
00:25:36,939 --> 00:25:38,680
open door.

623
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,773
Shit.

624
00:25:57,816 --> 00:26:00,036
If I may,
lenses can be sensitive

625
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:01,951
to changes
in your Internal Circumstances.

626
00:26:01,994 --> 00:26:04,257
You may need to adjust
if you're feeling off.

627
00:26:05,476 --> 00:26:07,086
God damn it.

628
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,281
If something is bothering you,

629
00:26:08,305 --> 00:26:10,089
I know I'm not the ideal
person to talk to,

630
00:26:10,133 --> 00:26:11,395
but I am here.

631
00:26:11,438 --> 00:26:14,528
I'm not feeling chatty
at the moment, okay?

632
00:26:20,491 --> 00:26:22,208
Look, you're not the only one
that made a mistake,

633
00:26:22,232 --> 00:26:25,104
'cause clearly
it's still bothering me.

634
00:26:27,106 --> 00:26:28,499
It's Fogg.

635
00:26:30,153 --> 00:26:31,545
He's stuck in the Etheric Realm,

636
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:34,635
and it's my fault.

637
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:36,028
Henry's in...

638
00:26:38,117 --> 00:26:40,424
He always was a sensualist.

639
00:26:40,467 --> 00:26:44,297
That place is a trap for people
like him, who enjoy, well...

640
00:26:44,341 --> 00:26:46,517
- Getting wasted?
- Mm.

641
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,085
He was trying to quit.

642
00:26:49,128 --> 00:26:50,236
He shouldn't have even
been in there.

643
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,652
He was only in there
because of me.

644
00:26:51,696 --> 00:26:53,132
And you were only there

645
00:26:53,176 --> 00:26:55,395
because you wanted
to help the hedges.

646
00:26:55,439 --> 00:26:58,181
You know,
if we're being honest...

647
00:26:59,704 --> 00:27:02,489
I wanted to get high.

648
00:27:02,533 --> 00:27:05,014
Lucky me, that's the only way
into the Etheric Realm.

649
00:27:06,406 --> 00:27:08,539
Fogg just...

650
00:27:08,582 --> 00:27:10,584
tagged along and got unlucky.

651
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:12,412
That wasn't luck.

652
00:27:12,456 --> 00:27:14,240
I know the Emperor of the Realm.

653
00:27:14,284 --> 00:27:15,589
If he kept Henry behind,

654
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:17,504
it was because
he sensed a flaw in him.

655
00:27:17,548 --> 00:27:18,897
And if he kicked you out,

656
00:27:18,941 --> 00:27:22,509
it was because you were trying
to do something good.

657
00:27:22,553 --> 00:27:24,424
Nothing bores him like goodness.

658
00:27:24,468 --> 00:27:26,078
Yeah, how do you know that?

659
00:27:26,122 --> 00:27:28,515
I spent three years there once.

660
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,300
Jesus.

661
00:27:32,302 --> 00:27:36,654
Before I came to the Library,
my life was... difficult.

662
00:27:38,221 --> 00:27:40,353
The Etheric Realm was an escape.

663
00:27:40,397 --> 00:27:42,355
How did you get out?

664
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:46,185
- I stopped hating myself.
- Eventually.

665
00:27:46,229 --> 00:27:48,709
And then the Emperor
grew bored with me.

666
00:27:48,753 --> 00:27:51,625
Whatever kept Henry there,
those were his demons,

667
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:55,064
and that is something
you couldn't fix.

668
00:27:55,107 --> 00:27:57,390
Well, it doesn't stop me from
feeling like shit about it.

669
00:27:57,414 --> 00:27:59,895
The fact that
you feel like shit,

670
00:27:59,938 --> 00:28:02,723
that is why you escaped.

671
00:28:02,767 --> 00:28:05,465
So allow me to be blunt.

672
00:28:05,509 --> 00:28:08,599
Don't waste time on self-pity.

673
00:28:08,642 --> 00:28:10,470
Do what you came to do.

674
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:13,125
Thanks.

675
00:28:15,649 --> 00:28:17,564
I'll try to be less
of a bitch to you.

676
00:28:17,608 --> 00:28:20,219
Mm. If you can.

677
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:31,752
It's working.

678
00:28:31,796 --> 00:28:33,624
I can see the wards.

679
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:34,799
This way.

680
00:28:42,198 --> 00:28:44,809
It sounds like he's home.
Look, fair warning...

681
00:28:51,294 --> 00:28:52,295
Who the hell are you?

682
00:28:52,338 --> 00:28:54,210
We're looking for Mayakovsky.

683
00:28:54,253 --> 00:28:56,299
Old, drunk, megalomaniac?

684
00:28:56,342 --> 00:28:58,257
Fondness for knit caps?

685
00:28:58,301 --> 00:28:59,432
Yeah, I'm his daughter.

686
00:28:59,476 --> 00:29:01,130
I didn't realize he...

687
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:02,827
- Fucked my mother?
- Neither did he.

688
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:05,438
Should've seen his face
when I came knockin'.

689
00:29:05,482 --> 00:29:08,267
But we're fine now.
What do you want?

690
00:29:08,311 --> 00:29:09,703
Can you let us down?

691
00:29:09,747 --> 00:29:11,314
Sure.

692
00:29:13,316 --> 00:29:14,404
Thanks.

693
00:29:16,014 --> 00:29:17,668
Look.

694
00:29:17,711 --> 00:29:19,670
We need to talk to your dad.

695
00:29:19,713 --> 00:29:22,368
He's busy.

696
00:29:22,412 --> 00:29:23,674
On our project.

697
00:29:23,717 --> 00:29:25,632
Look, we think he may
be the only person

698
00:29:25,676 --> 00:29:26,956
that can help us save the world.

699
00:29:26,982 --> 00:29:30,202
He put a special magical bond
on a moon rock,

700
00:29:30,246 --> 00:29:32,161
and we need his help
to break it.

701
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:36,208
Wait, please tell me you're
trying to rob Oren Westbrook.

702
00:29:36,252 --> 00:29:38,906
- How do you know that?
- I installed that bond.

703
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:42,388
Yeah, last nice thing I did
before I dumped his greasy ass.

704
00:29:42,432 --> 00:29:43,912
- That was you?
- What? You dated him?

705
00:29:43,955 --> 00:29:46,305
Don't judge, but yes.

706
00:29:46,349 --> 00:29:48,307
Anyfuck, right after
I installed the bond,

707
00:29:48,351 --> 00:29:49,830
I caught the maid pegging him,

708
00:29:49,874 --> 00:29:53,225
and not the maid
I okayed for threesomes.

709
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:54,618
- Mm...
- Okay.

710
00:29:54,661 --> 00:29:56,359
So that means you'll help us?

711
00:29:57,795 --> 00:29:58,839
I could.

712
00:29:58,883 --> 00:30:00,841
But I need something from you.

713
00:30:00,885 --> 00:30:03,322
A shade.

714
00:30:03,366 --> 00:30:06,282
Either of yours will do.

715
00:30:06,325 --> 00:30:08,632
What are you gonna do with it?

716
00:30:08,675 --> 00:30:11,548
- Are we gonna get it back?
- No.

717
00:30:11,591 --> 00:30:13,376
- You want my help?
- Mm-hmm.

718
00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:16,205
One shade, payment in advance.

719
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:17,554
Discuss.

720
00:30:29,609 --> 00:30:32,395
- It's safe.
- Thanks.

721
00:30:39,097 --> 00:30:42,057
Any idea where to find
a medical manual in here?

722
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,971
Unfortunately,
the organizational systems

723
00:30:44,015 --> 00:30:45,930
are down, so it may...

724
00:30:54,939 --> 00:30:56,810
May I?

725
00:31:01,815 --> 00:31:03,904
Hm.

726
00:31:05,776 --> 00:31:08,735
Sometimes I forget you're
a fucking master Magician.

727
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:10,781
I try to keep the showboating
to a minimum.

728
00:31:10,824 --> 00:31:12,759
Well, the Harmonic
Convergence is in a few hours.

729
00:31:12,783 --> 00:31:13,827
You know what that means.

730
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:16,003
I'll take this to Harriet ASAP.

731
00:31:16,047 --> 00:31:20,573
Tell her if, God forbid,
we can't stop it...

732
00:31:20,617 --> 00:31:23,017
we might need all the hedges we
can get to unfuck everything.

733
00:31:46,382 --> 00:31:47,774
Desperate times, huh?

734
00:31:47,818 --> 00:31:49,341
Didn't really have much choice.

735
00:31:49,385 --> 00:31:51,691
Hey, uh, Julia?

736
00:31:51,735 --> 00:31:54,390
Can you remind me why
I'm dressed like this, please?

737
00:31:54,433 --> 00:31:55,584
He's been like this all night.

738
00:31:55,608 --> 00:31:57,088
Just running on muffin fumes.

739
00:31:58,655 --> 00:32:00,546
Okay, let's just make sure
we're all on the same page.

740
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:03,442
Okay?
Okay, so Josh, Margo, Penny.

741
00:32:03,486 --> 00:32:05,357
You guys go inside,
loop all the cameras,

742
00:32:05,401 --> 00:32:06,880
open the side door for Natasha.

743
00:32:06,924 --> 00:32:09,318
I'll be outside waiting
with Eliot and Alice.

744
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:11,015
We won't cast the spell
until your signal.

745
00:32:11,058 --> 00:32:12,582
- You won't miss it.
- Ready?

746
00:32:12,625 --> 00:32:13,844
Break.

747
00:32:20,024 --> 00:32:22,766
- Eliot.
- What are you staring at?

748
00:32:24,681 --> 00:32:27,814
Pull the ripcord, get out.
We'll handle this.

749
00:32:27,858 --> 00:32:29,164
I am not cocking out.

750
00:32:29,207 --> 00:32:31,383
You're not right, El,
and we both know why.

751
00:32:31,427 --> 00:32:34,169
My crippling fear of/
attraction to authority?

752
00:32:34,212 --> 00:32:36,475
Are you being honest with me?

753
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:38,999
Bambi, always.

754
00:32:39,043 --> 00:32:40,890
I don't care if you've
been keeping it from me,

755
00:32:40,914 --> 00:32:42,699
but all of our asses
are on the line now.

756
00:32:42,742 --> 00:32:44,483
Margo.

757
00:32:44,527 --> 00:32:45,832
Do not worry about me.

758
00:32:45,876 --> 00:32:48,008
I know, I've been
a little bit off.

759
00:32:48,052 --> 00:32:49,619
Blame it on the moon brain.

760
00:32:49,662 --> 00:32:52,056
I promise I'm fine.

761
00:32:54,537 --> 00:32:55,538
'Kay?

762
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:27,657
Hey! How are you?

763
00:33:35,578 --> 00:33:36,578
Oh.

764
00:33:43,773 --> 00:33:45,296
Uh, no guests.

765
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,820
Can you fetch me another
plate of those crab puffs?

766
00:33:47,864 --> 00:33:49,083
Delish.

767
00:33:49,126 --> 00:33:50,998
Head of security.
Not your waiter.

768
00:33:51,041 --> 00:33:52,956
Oh, good for you.

769
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,262
Have you tried the crab puffs?

770
00:33:57,961 --> 00:33:59,658
- Hey, my drink!
- What the...

771
00:33:59,702 --> 00:34:01,051
Watch the suit!

772
00:34:01,095 --> 00:34:03,184
That's the third time
you've done that tonight!

773
00:34:03,227 --> 00:34:04,837
Watch what you're doing!

774
00:34:04,881 --> 00:34:06,163
I'm gonna take you outside
right now.

775
00:34:06,187 --> 00:34:08,754
All right, fellas,
break it up, break it up.

776
00:34:16,153 --> 00:34:17,720
I looped that one,

777
00:34:17,763 --> 00:34:19,306
but I don't remember
if I looped that one.

778
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:21,332
You don't remember
five seconds ago?

779
00:34:21,376 --> 00:34:24,814
Josh, I haven't had
short-term memory in two days.

780
00:34:24,857 --> 00:34:25,902
The only things I remember

781
00:34:25,945 --> 00:34:27,097
are being worried about Eliot

782
00:34:27,121 --> 00:34:28,122
and feeling like shit

783
00:34:28,165 --> 00:34:30,211
for trying to leave you
in the past.

784
00:34:30,254 --> 00:34:31,690
Really?

785
00:34:33,214 --> 00:34:36,130
Fucking moon brain.

786
00:34:36,173 --> 00:34:37,696
Totally spaced out.

787
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,176
Why are you looking at me
like that?

788
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,222
These are good.

789
00:34:44,312 --> 00:34:45,313
Let's go.

790
00:34:51,536 --> 00:34:53,060
It's true. It's true.

791
00:34:54,104 --> 00:34:55,932
Excuse me, sir.

792
00:34:55,975 --> 00:34:57,847
Excuse me.

793
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:59,718
We have an issue.

794
00:34:59,762 --> 00:35:01,155
Natasha?

795
00:35:01,198 --> 00:35:02,765
What the hell is she doing here?

796
00:35:02,808 --> 00:35:05,115
Well, my men will find out,
but I have a hunch.

797
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:08,118
There's one thing you own
that only she can steal.

798
00:35:22,828 --> 00:35:25,788
Bring back the rock.

799
00:35:30,836 --> 00:35:32,751
- Stop!
- Wh...

800
00:35:33,448 --> 00:35:34,753
Right there, right there!

801
00:35:37,278 --> 00:35:38,278
Let's go!

802
00:35:45,547 --> 00:35:48,376
- Natasha.
- Where is she going?

803
00:35:48,419 --> 00:35:51,944
For the last time,
we don't know.

804
00:35:51,988 --> 00:35:54,773
And even if we did,
we would never admit it.

805
00:35:56,253 --> 00:35:58,168
No bother.

806
00:35:58,212 --> 00:36:00,779
My men have her now.

807
00:36:12,139 --> 00:36:15,098
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What's going on?

808
00:36:15,142 --> 00:36:17,231
- Where's the moon rock?
- What... I don't...

809
00:36:17,274 --> 00:36:18,275
I don't know!

810
00:36:18,319 --> 00:36:19,624
Look, I was just hitchhiking,

811
00:36:19,668 --> 00:36:22,061
and a woman, she just
threw the keys at me, okay?

812
00:36:22,105 --> 00:36:23,933
Just take the van, whatever.

813
00:36:25,978 --> 00:36:27,328
Look, she went that way.

814
00:36:31,158 --> 00:36:32,942
She escaped?

815
00:36:32,985 --> 00:36:34,248
Where's the rock?

816
00:36:42,995 --> 00:36:45,476
Well, I officially
have moon brain.

817
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,218
I can see Her aura.
It's red.

818
00:36:49,088 --> 00:36:51,569
Let's do this quick
before anyone comes in.

819
00:36:51,613 --> 00:36:53,330
How long do we have to cast
the first part again?

820
00:36:53,354 --> 00:36:56,966
Until Her aura turns green
and She's listening.

821
00:37:13,069 --> 00:37:15,071
It's working.

822
00:37:20,468 --> 00:37:23,253
Where is Natasha
taking the rock?

823
00:37:23,297 --> 00:37:25,212
Okay... okay.

824
00:37:25,255 --> 00:37:27,388
She said she was going
to Philly.

825
00:37:27,431 --> 00:37:30,434
The only thing worse
than a traitor is a snitch.

826
00:37:30,478 --> 00:37:32,044
You make me wanna puke.

827
00:37:32,088 --> 00:37:33,611
Hey, hey, Josh.

828
00:37:33,655 --> 00:37:35,526
Do you have any more muffins?

829
00:37:40,357 --> 00:37:42,229
Almost there.

830
00:37:48,365 --> 00:37:49,671
We had it.

831
00:37:49,714 --> 00:37:50,933
What happened?

832
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:53,109
How did it turn red?

833
00:37:53,152 --> 00:37:54,371
Eliot?

834
00:37:54,415 --> 00:37:55,807
Wait, Eliot, come back!

835
00:37:55,851 --> 00:37:58,027
We don't have enough power
to finish this without you.

836
00:37:58,723 --> 00:38:00,247
Eliot.

837
00:38:02,118 --> 00:38:03,293
Eliot...

838
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:08,124
Let me out.

839
00:38:33,841 --> 00:38:36,844
You're not there.

840
00:38:36,887 --> 00:38:38,585
You're gone forever.

841
00:38:39,455 --> 00:38:41,849
Quentin threw you in the Seam.

842
00:38:47,028 --> 00:38:50,031
This isn't happening.
This is moon brain.

843
00:38:57,952 --> 00:38:59,475
Stop right there!

844
00:39:04,437 --> 00:39:07,875
My guards are in the room
with your friends.

845
00:39:07,918 --> 00:39:09,616
The rock never left, did it?

846
00:39:10,921 --> 00:39:12,532
You know, I want the snitch

847
00:39:12,575 --> 00:39:15,274
to tell me what's
really going on.

848
00:39:17,972 --> 00:39:20,540
- What happened?
- Asshole fell asleep again.

849
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:23,499
His fight-or-flight response
is to take a fucking nap.

850
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:35,337
Or something else is up.

851
00:39:38,906 --> 00:39:40,473
It wasn't me.

852
00:39:43,563 --> 00:39:45,347
In here, boss.

853
00:39:48,437 --> 00:39:51,397
Marina.

854
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,007
Ladies.

855
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,837
Did you put the guards to sleep?

856
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,448
Yeah, but I'm a little confused

857
00:39:59,492 --> 00:40:01,058
why you aren't snoozing too.

858
00:40:01,102 --> 00:40:03,757
The only thing stronger
than that spell is...

859
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:07,587
Oh, my God.
Are you on meth?

860
00:40:09,153 --> 00:40:12,374
You know,
it sure as hell seems like it.

861
00:40:20,469 --> 00:40:21,775
What are you doing here?

862
00:40:21,818 --> 00:40:23,385
Keeping you from
fucking up my shit.

863
00:40:23,429 --> 00:40:25,996
Harmonic Convergence, I need it.

864
00:40:28,521 --> 00:40:31,828
Like Daddy always said,
even meth can't beat handcuffs.

865
00:40:31,872 --> 00:40:33,850
I don't think you understand
how bad the Convergence is.

866
00:40:33,874 --> 00:40:35,832
No, I do.

867
00:40:35,876 --> 00:40:39,140
But what you don't understand
is how good it is for me.

868
00:40:39,183 --> 00:40:40,837
I have a very critical mission,

869
00:40:40,881 --> 00:40:42,761
and I need the power
convergence boost to do it.

870
00:40:42,796 --> 00:40:47,104
So just this one time,
could you please go home?

871
00:40:47,148 --> 00:40:48,802
Look,
whatever it is you're doing,

872
00:40:48,845 --> 00:40:50,543
it's not worth the world.

873
00:40:50,586 --> 00:40:51,718
Mm, yes, it is.

874
00:40:51,761 --> 00:40:53,043
I put a shitload
of work into this.

875
00:40:53,067 --> 00:40:55,635
I stole a Book Depository,
for Christ sake.

876
00:40:55,678 --> 00:40:57,985
That was you?

877
00:40:58,028 --> 00:41:00,640
You sent that memory assassin
after me.

878
00:41:00,683 --> 00:41:02,424
Yeah, and not a life assassin.

879
00:41:02,468 --> 00:41:03,730
You're welcome.

880
00:41:03,773 --> 00:41:07,386
We're even, since you
tipped us to this party.

881
00:41:07,429 --> 00:41:09,126
Frederick here...
That's not my name.

882
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:12,391
Okay, not-Frederick here,

883
00:41:12,434 --> 00:41:14,044
overheard you
in my Book Depository

884
00:41:14,088 --> 00:41:16,656
making these exciting plans
for the Convergence.

885
00:41:16,699 --> 00:41:18,135
Speaking of...

886
00:41:18,179 --> 00:41:19,702
just started.

887
00:41:22,575 --> 00:41:25,055
I flinch, it fires.

888
00:41:26,709 --> 00:41:28,450
Oh...

889
00:41:28,494 --> 00:41:29,886
I think we all
know what that was.

890
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:31,148
It's the surge.

891
00:41:31,192 --> 00:41:32,212
You know what that means,
Chickee-poo?

892
00:41:32,236 --> 00:41:33,760
Power is insane.

893
00:41:33,803 --> 00:41:35,457
You're holding a nuke right now.

894
00:41:35,501 --> 00:41:37,546
You let that thing go,
we all go bye-bye.

895
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:39,940
Kady, she's right; with
the Convergence and the surge,

896
00:41:39,983 --> 00:41:41,985
every spell is, like,
super-powered right now.

897
00:41:42,029 --> 00:41:44,510
Yeah, I bet you could
cast something solo

898
00:41:44,553 --> 00:41:46,468
that would normally
take three people.

899
00:41:46,512 --> 00:41:48,862
- Isn't that what I just said?
- Marina!

900
00:41:48,905 --> 00:41:51,473
Please, we are so close
to saving everyone.

901
00:41:51,517 --> 00:41:53,103
You can't just
take that away from us now.

902
00:41:53,127 --> 00:41:54,781
Whatever it is you're after,

903
00:41:54,824 --> 00:41:56,870
what's the point
if there's no world?

904
00:41:56,913 --> 00:42:00,700
There'll still be a world,
just not as many people.

905
00:42:00,743 --> 00:42:02,789
- Have you met people?
- She's listening!

906
00:42:02,832 --> 00:42:04,486
Eliot, go!

907
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:06,967
- The fuck are you doing?
- I've got it.

908
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:09,056
- You're moving the moon?
- Yeah.

909
00:42:09,099 --> 00:42:11,058
I'm moving it back.

910
00:42:41,741 --> 00:42:43,873
Uh...

911
00:42:43,917 --> 00:42:45,135
guys?

912
00:42:49,966 --> 00:42:52,665
I think we just broke the moon.

913
00:42:57,583 --> 00:42:59,715
Ah, shit.
