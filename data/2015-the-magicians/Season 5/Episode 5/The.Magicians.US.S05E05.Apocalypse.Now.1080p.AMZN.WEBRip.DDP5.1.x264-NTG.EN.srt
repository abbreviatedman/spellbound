1
00:00:06,397 --> 00:00:08,138
Previously,
on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:08,182 --> 00:00:09,661
There's too much magic.

3
00:00:09,705 --> 00:00:13,056
Everything that I touch just...
It just grows like crazy.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,276
I'm gonna let your bullshit
slide on account of you

5
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:18,714
so recently being possessed
by a homicidal monster.

6
00:00:18,757 --> 00:00:20,194
There was a blood worm scare,

7
00:00:20,237 --> 00:00:22,128
so the Library gave a lot
of hedges the Reed's Mark.

8
00:00:22,152 --> 00:00:24,633
I found a spell to remove
the Marks in a Depository.

9
00:00:24,676 --> 00:00:27,244
- I get you're on a mission.
- One of you's got to jet.

10
00:00:27,288 --> 00:00:29,333
Either one of you
can hang for eternity.

11
00:00:29,377 --> 00:00:31,814
I've earned the right
to step off.

12
00:00:31,857 --> 00:00:33,729
We're here to study
with Mayakovsky.

13
00:00:33,772 --> 00:00:35,644
I hate all of you.

14
00:00:35,687 --> 00:00:36,732
Professor?

15
00:00:39,213 --> 00:00:40,823
"Best bitches."

16
00:00:40,866 --> 00:00:43,608
Wear this,
and you'll see what I see.

17
00:00:43,652 --> 00:00:45,436
I'm Clarion,
the goddess of melody.

18
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,873
The way that you're imagining
the Harmonic Convergence

19
00:00:47,917 --> 00:00:49,571
isn't quite enough.

20
00:00:49,614 --> 00:00:52,400
When all the spells cast by
all the Magicians go haywire,

21
00:00:52,443 --> 00:00:55,446
you're gonna get earthquakes,
starvation, plague.

22
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,492
She didn't have time
to be delicate.

23
00:00:57,535 --> 00:00:59,363
You can't travel anymore.

24
00:00:59,407 --> 00:01:01,496
What exactly
are we looking for, sir?

25
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:03,889
Not what. Who.

26
00:01:03,933 --> 00:01:06,283
- You two know each other?
- No.

27
00:01:06,327 --> 00:01:08,198
Well, your subjects
are rightly grateful.

28
00:01:08,242 --> 00:01:09,417
For sending that letter?

29
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,506
AKA that thing I totally
didn't do; You did.

30
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:13,856
I was gonna let you die
for Fillory.

31
00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:15,640
The Convergence can be stopped.

32
00:01:15,684 --> 00:01:19,644
All you have to do is move...

33
00:01:19,688 --> 00:01:20,863
that.

34
00:01:23,257 --> 00:01:25,476
The Harmonic Convergence.

35
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,132
- AKA the end of the world.
- Not necessarily.

36
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:31,526
This constellation forms
a cosmic sigil

37
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:33,745
that increases
magical intensity.

38
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:36,400
It has happened in the past
without causing an apocalypse.

39
00:01:36,444 --> 00:01:38,185
But now there's surges of magic.

40
00:01:38,228 --> 00:01:41,405
So we get the disaster movie
Clarion was talking about.

41
00:01:41,449 --> 00:01:42,687
The Convergence will only occur

42
00:01:42,711 --> 00:01:44,669
during this perfect alignment.

43
00:01:44,713 --> 00:01:47,281
If we move the moon
out of position...

44
00:01:47,324 --> 00:01:49,413
No Convergence, no Circumstance,

45
00:01:49,457 --> 00:01:50,588
no apocalypse.

46
00:01:50,632 --> 00:01:52,416
The moon is not just
a rock in space.

47
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,375
It has certain properties.

48
00:01:54,418 --> 00:01:56,420
- Like?
- Magic doesn't work on it.

49
00:01:56,464 --> 00:01:58,770
Thanks to Magicians
casting haphazardly on it

50
00:01:58,814 --> 00:02:01,164
for millennia, the moon
is now covered by a crust

51
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:03,340
of spell debris,
blocking new spells.

52
00:02:03,384 --> 00:02:06,430
If we move any piece
out of place, no Convergence.

53
00:02:06,474 --> 00:02:08,867
Well, what if we just
moved Mars?

54
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:11,348
She said with a straight face.

55
00:02:11,392 --> 00:02:13,655
The other pieces are planets.

56
00:02:13,698 --> 00:02:15,657
We can't move them
because they are, well,

57
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,962
very big and far away.

58
00:02:17,006 --> 00:02:18,921
The moon is the only
celestial body

59
00:02:18,964 --> 00:02:20,488
we stand a chance of affecting.

60
00:02:20,531 --> 00:02:22,707
But won't that screw
with the Circumstances?

61
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:24,294
What will magic be like
when we're done?

62
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:25,623
Impossible to know.

63
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:27,669
It will be a brand-new
Circumstance.

64
00:02:28,887 --> 00:02:31,934
But to get to that problem,
we need to solve this one.

65
00:02:31,977 --> 00:02:33,805
Good, well,
I hope you have some ideas,

66
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:35,590
because we're striking out.

67
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:37,635
I do. Consult the Lunatics.

68
00:02:38,897 --> 00:02:41,857
- The lunatics?
- Short for "Lunar Fanatics."

69
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,207
In the Middle Ages,
people thought insanity

70
00:02:44,251 --> 00:02:46,209
was caused by changing phases
of the moon.

71
00:02:46,253 --> 00:02:49,299
In fact, it was often a Lunatic
in the throes of worship.

72
00:02:49,343 --> 00:02:52,302
They claimed to be able
to achieve a magical connection

73
00:02:52,346 --> 00:02:54,652
with the moon and even under
some circumstances...

74
00:02:54,696 --> 00:02:56,001
move it.

75
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:58,743
- Well, that sounds useful.
- Mm.

76
00:02:58,787 --> 00:03:00,397
Well, if it's just branding,

77
00:03:00,441 --> 00:03:02,530
it means they're
not really crazy, right?

78
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:05,402
My dad always said that
they were batshit insane,

79
00:03:05,446 --> 00:03:07,578
and he married my mom,
so he had a pretty high bar

80
00:03:07,622 --> 00:03:09,058
for mental instability.

81
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:12,279
Regardless, they know more
about the moon than anyone.

82
00:03:12,322 --> 00:03:15,673
I believe that talking to them
is our only chance at success.

83
00:03:34,518 --> 00:03:35,824
What people don't understand

84
00:03:35,867 --> 00:03:37,608
is there is a skeleton
of the universe,

85
00:03:37,652 --> 00:03:38,914
but we are the bones.

86
00:03:38,957 --> 00:03:41,308
Oh, that's good to know.

87
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:42,874
I am a humerus.

88
00:03:42,918 --> 00:03:45,616
You? Patella.

89
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,575
We wanted to ask you
about the moon.

90
00:03:47,618 --> 00:03:49,707
Can we talk about it?

91
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:51,231
It... it?

92
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:53,929
Her Lunacy...

93
00:03:55,322 --> 00:03:58,934
Identifies as she/her.

94
00:03:58,977 --> 00:04:01,545
- That's right.
- We knew that, right?

95
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:03,591
- Of course.
- We know.

96
00:04:03,634 --> 00:04:06,550
If we wanted to move Her,
how could we do that?

97
00:04:06,594 --> 00:04:08,987
You don't move Her.

98
00:04:09,031 --> 00:04:11,468
Okay, listen, Reba.

99
00:04:11,512 --> 00:04:14,515
In just a few days, a whole lot
of people are going to die.

100
00:04:14,558 --> 00:04:15,777
That's a whole lot people

101
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,363
that will never
get to worship the moon.

102
00:04:17,387 --> 00:04:19,737
They will never get
to know Her like you do.

103
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:23,480
If She can help us save
all of those lives...

104
00:04:23,524 --> 00:04:26,091
imagine everyone
that will realize

105
00:04:26,135 --> 00:04:28,442
just how much
She deserves their love,

106
00:04:28,485 --> 00:04:29,834
their reverence.

107
00:04:29,878 --> 00:04:31,619
So will you help us?

108
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:35,492
Just to be clear.

109
00:04:36,711 --> 00:04:39,104
You don't move Her.

110
00:04:39,148 --> 00:04:42,412
You ask Her to move.

111
00:04:42,456 --> 00:04:44,893
And She won't let you speak to
Her unless you get moon brain.

112
00:04:44,936 --> 00:04:46,764
So one of us needs moon brain.

113
00:04:46,808 --> 00:04:49,767
Not one of you. Three of you.

114
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:52,379
A single Magician cannot
generate enough power

115
00:04:52,422 --> 00:04:53,771
to reach Her.

116
00:04:53,815 --> 00:04:55,556
So it's
a cooperative spell then.

117
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:57,645
It is a sign of respect,
Kneecap,

118
00:04:57,688 --> 00:05:00,343
that allows you to see Her
as She truly is.

119
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:03,041
If you have moon brain,
then you will see Her aura.

120
00:05:03,085 --> 00:05:04,976
Now it is red, but when you
perform the Dianic Ritual,

121
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,393
Her aura will change.

122
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:08,090
If it is yellow,
She is considering.

123
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:11,528
If it is green,
She is listening.

124
00:05:11,572 --> 00:05:14,531
Only then may you ask Her

125
00:05:14,575 --> 00:05:15,750
to move.

126
00:05:15,793 --> 00:05:17,099
Red, yellow, green.

127
00:05:17,142 --> 00:05:19,101
The guy who invented
the stoplight,

128
00:05:19,144 --> 00:05:21,364
was he a Lunatic too?

129
00:05:21,408 --> 00:05:23,801
William Potts? Yeah.

130
00:05:23,845 --> 00:05:25,629
Oh, cool.

131
00:05:25,673 --> 00:05:27,892
All three Magicians
must perform the ritual

132
00:05:27,936 --> 00:05:30,373
until the moon is listening.

133
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:33,942
A warning: Once Her aura is
green, She may choose to listen

134
00:05:33,985 --> 00:05:36,466
to anyone who calls to Her,
so be ready.

135
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,860
You must choose one,
the strongest among you,

136
00:05:38,903 --> 00:05:42,646
to speak to Her, like the old
Lunatics taught us to.

137
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,605
For this second part,
however, there is a price.

138
00:05:44,648 --> 00:05:47,434
- A price, like blood?
- It is like blood to Her.

139
00:05:48,739 --> 00:05:51,699
You will need a piece of Her.
A sacrifice.

140
00:05:51,742 --> 00:05:53,614
A piece?

141
00:05:53,657 --> 00:05:55,833
- Or like a moon rock?
- Yes.

142
00:05:55,877 --> 00:05:58,053
But be aware,

143
00:05:58,096 --> 00:06:00,098
this will destroy it,

144
00:06:00,142 --> 00:06:02,884
so don't use your favorite one.

145
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:06,540
This is the price
of speaking to the moon.

146
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,672
Just a few more questions.

147
00:06:08,716 --> 00:06:11,806
What is moon brain,
and how do we get it?

148
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:14,939
- Everyone line up.
- Pudding time!

149
00:06:14,983 --> 00:06:16,985
Lovely to speak to you.

150
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:18,900
You too, Kneecap.

151
00:06:23,905 --> 00:06:27,474
You ever just spin a globe,
stick your finger down,

152
00:06:27,517 --> 00:06:29,519
see where it lands?

153
00:06:29,563 --> 00:06:32,522
It's almost always water,
because, well, duh.

154
00:06:32,566 --> 00:06:35,569
Earth is mostly water,
but sometimes it's the Sahara,

155
00:06:35,612 --> 00:06:38,572
sometimes the Urals.

156
00:06:38,615 --> 00:06:41,575
That's what you'd be doing
if you tried to travel.

157
00:06:41,618 --> 00:06:44,752
Only instead of the globe,
the multiverse,

158
00:06:44,795 --> 00:06:47,537
which is bigger and deadlier.

159
00:06:47,581 --> 00:06:49,104
Afraid you'd say that.

160
00:06:49,147 --> 00:06:50,734
I looked at everything
I could think of,

161
00:06:50,758 --> 00:06:52,542
magical and medical.

162
00:06:52,586 --> 00:06:54,588
Nada. You're grounded.

163
00:06:55,893 --> 00:06:57,218
All right, well,
since I ain't traveling,

164
00:06:57,242 --> 00:06:58,548
I should probably step down.

165
00:06:58,592 --> 00:07:00,004
Uh, if you're offering
your resignation,

166
00:07:00,028 --> 00:07:01,116
I don't accept.

167
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:02,900
Not offering. Stating.

168
00:07:02,944 --> 00:07:05,076
With Dean Fogg out indefinitely,

169
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,036
Brakebills has instituted
our Dean Vanishment Protocol.

170
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:10,778
Of course, that's a thing here.

171
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:13,128
Yeah, and uh...

172
00:07:13,171 --> 00:07:14,738
That makes me
acting Dean Lipson.

173
00:07:14,782 --> 00:07:16,087
There's no instruction manual,

174
00:07:16,131 --> 00:07:17,785
so I'm kinda dean-ing
on the fly here,

175
00:07:17,828 --> 00:07:19,134
but one thing I do know

176
00:07:19,177 --> 00:07:20,918
is losing a professor
who was disabled

177
00:07:20,962 --> 00:07:22,920
on school grounds
ain't happening.

178
00:07:22,964 --> 00:07:25,488
I mean, the optics
would be pure shitflakes.

179
00:07:25,532 --> 00:07:29,449
So your contract
will be honored and enforced.

180
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:32,713
Oh, also.

181
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:35,846
We need a new Welters coach.

182
00:07:38,806 --> 00:07:41,591
I've been on the inside,
and I'm telling you

183
00:07:41,635 --> 00:07:43,158
it's a goddamn goose-stepping,

184
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:45,943
Fairy-snatching,
ethnic cleansing Gestapo.

185
00:07:45,987 --> 00:07:48,119
To be fair,
the ethnic cleansing happened

186
00:07:48,163 --> 00:07:50,078
after the Dark King left, so...

187
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:52,036
He's innocent
because he delegates?

188
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,734
No, that's not what I'm saying.

189
00:07:53,777 --> 00:07:55,953
Someone in this castle ordered
the hunt on that Fairy.

190
00:07:55,997 --> 00:07:57,148
It could have been
the Dark King,

191
00:07:57,172 --> 00:07:58,652
but if it was someone else,

192
00:07:58,695 --> 00:08:00,610
killing Seb might just make
things worse.

193
00:08:00,654 --> 00:08:05,833
So we have to find out who
before we... coup.

194
00:08:07,225 --> 00:08:09,880
I just wanna stab someone.

195
00:08:09,924 --> 00:08:12,100
I haven't heard you
this bloodthirsty in...

196
00:08:12,143 --> 00:08:14,711
Well, not that long,
but still, it's notable.

197
00:08:14,755 --> 00:08:17,148
Maybe I'm a bit on edge.

198
00:08:17,192 --> 00:08:19,063
Josh keeps wanting to talk.

199
00:08:19,107 --> 00:08:20,258
You mean about how you wanted

200
00:08:20,282 --> 00:08:21,346
to leave him in the past to die?

201
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,807
Yeah, that.

202
00:08:23,851 --> 00:08:25,940
So far, I'm doing a good job
of avoiding him,

203
00:08:25,983 --> 00:08:27,724
but eventually
he's gonna sneak...

204
00:08:27,768 --> 00:08:28,899
Guys.

205
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:30,771
- Hey, what's up?
- 'Sup?

206
00:08:30,814 --> 00:08:32,816
First off,
kudos on the hiding spot.

207
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,602
- It took me forever to find you.
- Pretty busy here, Josh.

208
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:36,690
You're busy?

209
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:37,797
I just got promoted
to head chef.

210
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:39,867
- Oh, congratulations.
- Thank you.

211
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,869
But I'm about to bail
on a state dinner

212
00:08:41,912 --> 00:08:44,349
and leave it to my incompetent
sous-chef because...

213
00:08:44,393 --> 00:08:46,177
Apocalypse! Now!

214
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:48,179
Josh, would you just give it up?

215
00:08:48,223 --> 00:08:49,896
He keeps trying to get us
to join his film club,

216
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,680
which I told him would
never work on a planet

217
00:08:51,705 --> 00:08:53,663
with no electricity or taste.

218
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:56,884
- Uh, no, uh, sorry.
- This one's just a little shy.

219
00:08:56,927 --> 00:08:58,320
It... it's okay, buddy.

220
00:08:58,363 --> 00:09:01,889
- Help us stop the...
- Apocalypse! Now!

221
00:09:02,716 --> 00:09:04,935
- Oh.
- We need to get back to Earth.

222
00:09:04,979 --> 00:09:06,633
Margo, our talk
will have to wait

223
00:09:06,676 --> 00:09:08,330
till after we save the world.

224
00:09:08,373 --> 00:09:10,637
Oh, but then I have
my nephew's bar mitzvah.

225
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,247
So after that?

226
00:09:13,422 --> 00:09:15,032
- Mazel.
- Thanks.

227
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:18,253
What about our thing?

228
00:09:18,296 --> 00:09:20,298
We have a lot
of fact-finding to do

229
00:09:20,342 --> 00:09:21,996
before I can get to stabbing.

230
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,388
No problem.

231
00:09:23,432 --> 00:09:25,129
I know just who to handle it.

232
00:09:25,173 --> 00:09:26,914
You want me to what?

233
00:09:26,957 --> 00:09:30,134
Just find out who
in the castle hates Fairies.

234
00:09:30,178 --> 00:09:32,397
Okay?
And what they're doing to them.

235
00:09:32,441 --> 00:09:34,138
And why Fairies
in the first place?

236
00:09:34,182 --> 00:09:37,054
And maybe talk to some Fairies,
get their side of things.

237
00:09:37,098 --> 00:09:39,317
- Okay.
- And while you're at it...

238
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:41,755
anything else
that seems important.

239
00:09:41,798 --> 00:09:43,626
Okay, okay, okay. No, um...

240
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,125
That seems like a lot
of open-ended questions.

241
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:46,107
Mm-hmm.

242
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,499
I got this maid job

243
00:09:47,543 --> 00:09:50,154
to be close to you guys,
and now you're deserting me?

244
00:09:51,678 --> 00:09:53,636
I want to stop
an apocalypse too.

245
00:09:54,681 --> 00:09:56,639
Every
apocalypse-stopping mission

246
00:09:56,683 --> 00:09:58,772
needs a maid on the outside.

247
00:09:58,815 --> 00:10:00,643
It's a key staple
in Earth movies.

248
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:01,905
Do you mean inside man?

249
00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:03,690
'Cause that's more
of a heist movie thing.

250
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:05,866
- No, that's different.
- Okay.

251
00:10:05,909 --> 00:10:07,345
Everyone knows

252
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:09,957
the "secret, sexy maid
on the outside" trope.

253
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,828
- Yeah?
- Josh has a film club.

254
00:10:11,872 --> 00:10:14,222
- You should check it out.
- Huh.

255
00:10:14,265 --> 00:10:17,181
Maid on the outside. Yeah.

256
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:22,665
So did your loony friend
say how to get moon brain?

257
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:24,449
From what we read, her rituals

258
00:10:24,493 --> 00:10:26,843
are simple first-year
Popper tuts.

259
00:10:26,887 --> 00:10:28,410
But moon brain is...

260
00:10:28,453 --> 00:10:32,066
the insanity you get from
extreme sleep deprivation.

261
00:10:32,109 --> 00:10:33,676
Extreme, like a night partying,

262
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,740
or what are we talking about?

263
00:10:34,764 --> 00:10:36,070
I wish.

264
00:10:36,113 --> 00:10:37,767
Five nights without sleep,

265
00:10:37,811 --> 00:10:39,856
and we can't use magic
to stay awake either.

266
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,293
Apparently, moon brain
has to come about naturally.

267
00:10:42,337 --> 00:10:44,295
This is completely nuts.

268
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:47,081
Isn't the Harmonic whatever
happening in five nights?

269
00:10:47,124 --> 00:10:49,300
Yes, so if we all start tonight,

270
00:10:49,344 --> 00:10:51,215
we might actually have
a shot at stopping it.

271
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:52,652
Wait a minute.

272
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:55,132
Five nights without sleep
is gonna fuck us up royally.

273
00:10:55,176 --> 00:10:58,135
Can we even cast
if we're that messed up?

274
00:10:58,179 --> 00:10:59,789
Well, three of us have to.

275
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,486
Look, guys, I know it sucks,

276
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:06,230
but whoever can stay up
for 132 hours

277
00:11:06,274 --> 00:11:09,233
without sleep
and not lose their shit...

278
00:11:09,277 --> 00:11:11,453
gets to stop the apocalypse.

279
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:18,416
I don't know about you guys,
but I am doing great.

280
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:20,375
Coffee.

281
00:11:20,418 --> 00:11:21,768
Where's our fearless leader?

282
00:11:21,811 --> 00:11:24,509
She's taking a cold shower
to keep herself awake.

283
00:11:24,553 --> 00:11:26,686
Third... fourth time this morning.

284
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:28,775
Well, I don't know
about you guys,

285
00:11:28,818 --> 00:11:30,907
but I am too excited to sleep.

286
00:11:30,951 --> 00:11:32,692
I mean, we're doing it!

287
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,346
Is this, uh,
helping you find moon rocks?

288
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:36,696
Mm.

289
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:39,655
No, this is helping us
stay awake.

290
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,875
The moment I research,
I'm out like a light.

291
00:11:41,918 --> 00:11:43,311
Know what might help?

292
00:11:43,354 --> 00:11:45,617
If we make this party
a little more '80s themed.

293
00:11:45,661 --> 00:11:47,576
Eliot.

294
00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:49,534
Oh, I don't think we should.

295
00:11:49,578 --> 00:11:51,667
If we ski the fresh powder,
know what I mean?

296
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,452
- Yeah, I get it.
- I mean cocaine.

297
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:56,256
- Get me cocaine.
- I am not getting you cocaine.

298
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,456
Eliot.

299
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,217
A five-day bender
would destroy your nose,

300
00:12:00,241 --> 00:12:01,808
and could you imagine
what that would do

301
00:12:01,851 --> 00:12:02,896
to your sense of taste?

302
00:12:02,939 --> 00:12:04,375
I get a full nine every night,

303
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:05,376
and I'm still a bitch.

304
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,508
This is gonna get real.

305
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:08,336
Hey, guys, come check this out.

306
00:12:11,818 --> 00:12:13,602
I found something.

307
00:12:13,645 --> 00:12:15,473
NASA brought back
a bunch of moon rocks

308
00:12:15,517 --> 00:12:16,736
from the Apollo missions.

309
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:18,694
- We're stealing from NASA?
- Hell, yeah.

310
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,914
Mama's checking one more
off her bucket list.

311
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:22,524
Okay, we're not stealing
from NASA.

312
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:24,787
I checked, it's impossible.
I'm sorry.

313
00:12:24,831 --> 00:12:26,504
But some of the rocks
that they brought back,

314
00:12:26,528 --> 00:12:28,704
they gave out as gifts,
and they went missing.

315
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,011
About 180.

316
00:12:31,054 --> 00:12:32,316
The ones they did find,

317
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,709
they found 'em in garages,

318
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,406
desk drawers, kids' bedrooms.

319
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,407
Just lying around.

320
00:12:36,451 --> 00:12:37,495
People forgot about them,

321
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:38,801
but they're out there,

322
00:12:38,845 --> 00:12:40,455
and I definitely think
we can get one.

323
00:12:40,498 --> 00:12:41,717
Okay, you guys do that.

324
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:43,545
I'm gonna go get some
stay-awake supplies.

325
00:12:43,588 --> 00:12:46,374
I have a muffin recipe
with a special ingredient

326
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:48,593
that is guaranteed to keep us
alert for five days.

327
00:12:48,637 --> 00:12:50,378
What is it? Meth?

328
00:12:50,421 --> 00:12:51,771
Oh, excuse you.

329
00:12:51,814 --> 00:12:54,425
It is a organic, locally-sourced

330
00:12:54,469 --> 00:12:57,864
natural stimulant that got me
through every finals week,

331
00:12:57,907 --> 00:12:59,343
and it is definitely not meth.

332
00:12:59,387 --> 00:13:00,692
That's exactly what I would say

333
00:13:00,736 --> 00:13:02,346
if I was trying
to get us to take meth.

334
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,783
Mm-hmm.

335
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:15,272
You're taking retirement well.

336
00:13:15,316 --> 00:13:17,318
I find that organization

337
00:13:17,361 --> 00:13:20,712
helps bring a sense of
stability when one's feeling...

338
00:13:20,756 --> 00:13:21,844
not stable.

339
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:22,889
Okay.

340
00:13:24,586 --> 00:13:27,458
I need to find a Book
Depository that got moved.

341
00:13:27,502 --> 00:13:28,784
It's in Hell's Kitchen,
that's all I know.

342
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,766
Library buildings
are enchanted to blend in

343
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,986
with their new environs
whenever they're relocated.

344
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:34,639
You'll have to go door-to-door,

345
00:13:34,683 --> 00:13:36,554
find the building covered in
Library wards.

346
00:13:36,598 --> 00:13:37,947
Great. Let's go.

347
00:13:37,991 --> 00:13:40,558
You're abandoning your friends?

348
00:13:40,602 --> 00:13:43,518
They have enough people
for a rock search.

349
00:13:43,561 --> 00:13:45,583
Plus, whatever's in Josh's
muffins doesn't sound like

350
00:13:45,607 --> 00:13:48,392
something a person
in recovery should be taking.

351
00:13:48,436 --> 00:13:49,872
I need to find the Depository

352
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:52,353
before we move the moon
and screw up magic.

353
00:13:52,396 --> 00:13:55,399
Right now, we have enough
to remove Reed's Marks.

354
00:13:55,443 --> 00:13:58,315
After, like you said, who knows?

355
00:13:59,403 --> 00:14:01,449
I'm not sure
I'd be much use to you.

356
00:14:01,492 --> 00:14:02,929
Out in the world.

357
00:14:02,972 --> 00:14:05,801
The building's impenetrable
on a good day.

358
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,848
Unless you're a Librarian who
knows the security protocols.

359
00:14:10,153 --> 00:14:11,633
I don't know...

360
00:14:11,676 --> 00:14:15,332
I'm not asking for your help.

361
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:18,901
I'm giving you a chance to fix
your massive, massive mistake.

362
00:14:18,945 --> 00:14:20,947
Mm.

363
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,818
Let's go.

364
00:14:39,008 --> 00:14:40,705
High King Fen?

365
00:14:41,532 --> 00:14:42,838
Fairy!

366
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,841
Keep the High King talk quiet.

367
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,364
I'm undercover.

368
00:14:47,408 --> 00:14:49,062
- You will come with me.
- Oh!

369
00:14:49,105 --> 00:14:50,672
That... that is so great.

370
00:14:50,715 --> 00:14:52,630
I have a lot
of questions for you.

371
00:14:52,674 --> 00:14:54,937
Some I don't even know
why I'm asking.

372
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:56,765
They said you would fear me.

373
00:14:56,808 --> 00:14:58,375
Funny thing.

374
00:14:58,419 --> 00:15:00,551
I am on a Fairy quest.

375
00:15:00,595 --> 00:15:04,555
See, I'm a maid on the outside.

376
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:07,645
Super-secret. Super-sexy.

377
00:15:09,038 --> 00:15:11,954
Follow me,
Maid on the Outside Fen.

378
00:15:11,998 --> 00:15:13,173
Good.

379
00:15:13,216 --> 00:15:14,565
Okay.

380
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,748
- Guess what I found.
- You found a moon rock?

381
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:25,533
I found a moon rock.

382
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:27,187
And those muffins smell amazing.

383
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,275
Thank you.

384
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:30,799
Now all we have to do
is stay awake.

385
00:15:30,842 --> 00:15:32,540
You know what helps me
stay awake?

386
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:33,541
What's that?

387
00:15:33,584 --> 00:15:36,022
An open, naked conversation

388
00:15:36,065 --> 00:15:37,719
about our relationship.

389
00:15:39,025 --> 00:15:42,158
I wanna tell you about
all my repressed emotions.

390
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:46,902
One by one.

391
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,817
Oh, baby.

392
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,862
Josh.

393
00:15:50,906 --> 00:15:53,604
Josh.

394
00:15:53,648 --> 00:15:54,692
Josh!

395
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,434
Josh!

396
00:15:57,478 --> 00:15:59,959
- Oh, no.
- Josh!

397
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,874
Oh, shit.

398
00:16:02,918 --> 00:16:04,789
Oh, shit!

399
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:09,577
We leave you for one afternoon,

400
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,013
and you fuck us completely.

401
00:16:11,057 --> 00:16:12,972
I'm sorry, guys.

402
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:16,018
I sat down for one minute
because I never fall asleep

403
00:16:16,062 --> 00:16:17,846
when I have
something in the oven.

404
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:19,891
Well, congratulations.

405
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:21,981
This is a milestone for you.

406
00:16:22,024 --> 00:16:23,112
Hey, guys.

407
00:16:23,156 --> 00:16:24,853
Hope you had better luck
than we did.

408
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:27,899
Nope, we portal-hopped
every lead we had.

409
00:16:27,943 --> 00:16:30,163
The closest thing we found
was a chunk of old concrete

410
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:32,687
with the word "moon"
written on it in Sharpie.

411
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:33,905
Those rocks are gone.

412
00:16:33,949 --> 00:16:35,037
But we did come home

413
00:16:35,081 --> 00:16:37,039
to find Josh
sleeping peacefully.

414
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,172
I'm going
to assume your rudeness

415
00:16:39,215 --> 00:16:41,652
is because sleep deprivation
makes you irritable.

416
00:16:41,696 --> 00:16:43,132
Sure. Assume that.

417
00:16:43,176 --> 00:16:45,004
Yeah, I get it.

418
00:16:45,047 --> 00:16:47,223
I'm gonna have to staple
my eyes open; This is rough.

419
00:16:47,267 --> 00:16:50,226
- No one else sleeps.
- We have four nights.

420
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,794
We need one rock lead
to pan out.

421
00:16:52,837 --> 00:16:54,230
But if the spell burns them up,

422
00:16:54,274 --> 00:16:56,015
what if we can't find any rocks

423
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:57,973
because the Lunatics
used them all?

424
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,715
What if there's no more
moon rocks on Earth?

425
00:17:00,758 --> 00:17:02,238
Just sayin',

426
00:17:02,282 --> 00:17:05,111
we could celebrate the Harmonic
Convergence in Fillory.

427
00:17:05,154 --> 00:17:07,809
It's a little dystopian
at the mo',

428
00:17:07,852 --> 00:17:09,550
but on the plus,
their weekend forecast

429
00:17:09,593 --> 00:17:11,160
doesn't call for an apocalypse.

430
00:17:14,337 --> 00:17:16,687
Look, guys,

431
00:17:16,731 --> 00:17:19,560
if you're looking for some
sort of inspirational speech

432
00:17:19,603 --> 00:17:22,519
on why you should
stay and fight,

433
00:17:22,563 --> 00:17:25,131
I can't help you.

434
00:17:25,174 --> 00:17:27,263
It's gonna suck,
and even if we do succeed,

435
00:17:27,307 --> 00:17:29,570
which we might not,

436
00:17:29,613 --> 00:17:32,660
it's not like we're gonna
get any credit.

437
00:17:32,703 --> 00:17:35,054
The world ends, I end with it,

438
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:38,231
knowing that I did
everything I could,

439
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:41,625
because I won't be able
to live with myself otherwise.

440
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:43,149
Julia's right.

441
00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:46,195
She really does suck
at inspirational speeches.

442
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:51,200
But also that we should
save the world.

443
00:17:51,244 --> 00:17:52,201
I'm with you.

444
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:53,855
So am I.

445
00:17:53,898 --> 00:17:55,291
Me too.

446
00:17:55,335 --> 00:17:56,771
I'm in.

447
00:17:56,814 --> 00:17:59,121
And my axe!

448
00:18:01,732 --> 00:18:04,039
- Really? No?
- No.

449
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,172
Should've led with,
"You have my bow."

450
00:18:06,215 --> 00:18:07,173
- Mm-hmm.
- Nope.

451
00:18:07,216 --> 00:18:08,348
Josh,

452
00:18:08,391 --> 00:18:10,263
put some fresh
meth muffins in the oven.

453
00:18:10,306 --> 00:18:12,830
Again, not meth.

454
00:18:20,229 --> 00:18:22,927
- Hey!
- No droopy eyes on my watch.

455
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:26,061
One more.

456
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,976
I'm good now.

457
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:28,977
I ain't.

458
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:32,589
Oh, well, right on cue.

459
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:36,071
I tried something new
this round.

460
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:40,119
A hint of lavender
and goji berry.

461
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:41,903
How we doin', Captain?

462
00:18:41,946 --> 00:18:43,948
Oh, you know, 12 hours
till the end of the world,

463
00:18:43,992 --> 00:18:45,602
and it's like we're still

464
00:18:45,646 --> 00:18:47,213
grasping for needles
in a hay straw.

465
00:18:47,256 --> 00:18:49,737
Fun. Okay.

466
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,913
Probably not the best question
for morale,

467
00:18:51,956 --> 00:18:54,829
but as the only person here
who's slept this week,

468
00:18:54,872 --> 00:18:57,745
we have 12 hours and zero leads.

469
00:18:57,788 --> 00:19:00,182
Is waiting here to die
really the best option?

470
00:19:00,226 --> 00:19:02,619
When are we gonna give
Margo's idea another think?

471
00:19:05,709 --> 00:19:07,252
Guys, I can't trust
my brain right now,

472
00:19:07,276 --> 00:19:09,235
but this seems like
it could be relevant.

473
00:19:09,278 --> 00:19:12,325
I think this guy
has a moon rock.

474
00:19:12,368 --> 00:19:13,978
- Oren Westbrook.
- Why do I know him?

475
00:19:14,022 --> 00:19:15,304
Because you're not
a cave person.

476
00:19:15,328 --> 00:19:17,982
He invented the tech
for pop-up ads,

477
00:19:18,026 --> 00:19:20,637
and he invented the tech
to block pop-up ads.

478
00:19:20,681 --> 00:19:22,378
Ever since, he's just been
a weird rich guy

479
00:19:22,422 --> 00:19:24,685
doing weird-rich-guy shit.

480
00:19:24,728 --> 00:19:27,122
I heard his blood boy
has his own blood boy.

481
00:19:29,037 --> 00:19:31,300
Ew, what's on his eye?

482
00:19:31,344 --> 00:19:33,650
That's the same tattoo
that Reba had.

483
00:19:33,694 --> 00:19:35,783
Julia, I think he's a Lunatic.

484
00:19:35,826 --> 00:19:37,915
All right.

485
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:40,962
So in order to save the world,
all we have to do

486
00:19:41,005 --> 00:19:45,662
is convince some eccentric
billionaire with armed guards

487
00:19:45,706 --> 00:19:48,883
to give up something he
probably considers to be, like,

488
00:19:48,926 --> 00:19:50,406
his Holy Grail.

489
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:53,931
All while we're so tired
we can't see straight.

490
00:19:53,975 --> 00:19:56,282
Pshh, no sweat.

491
00:20:01,287 --> 00:20:02,375
Marvelous.

492
00:20:02,418 --> 00:20:04,638
How did you handle the pain?

493
00:20:05,508 --> 00:20:07,554
Knowing it would bring
me closer to Her Lunacy

494
00:20:07,597 --> 00:20:09,991
helped me get through it.

495
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:13,473
Same as when I got mine.

496
00:20:13,516 --> 00:20:15,388
That and a handful of opiates.

497
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,414
Hey, sorry about the security.

498
00:20:22,438 --> 00:20:23,657
I hope you guys understand.

499
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,137
Ah, please, you can't
let in every Lunatic.

500
00:20:26,181 --> 00:20:27,400
Some people are crazy.

501
00:20:29,445 --> 00:20:31,317
Eliot.

502
00:20:33,536 --> 00:20:36,235
Oh, wow,
you guys really look awful.

503
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:37,236
What?

504
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:38,237
Eliot...

505
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,412
Your sunken eyes!

506
00:20:39,455 --> 00:20:40,413
Let me out.

507
00:20:40,456 --> 00:20:42,153
Preparing for moon brain?

508
00:20:42,197 --> 00:20:44,591
The Harmonic Convergence.

509
00:20:44,634 --> 00:20:46,506
Mm! Yeah, baby.

510
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:48,203
I'm celebrating too.

511
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,988
I'm gonna have a few friends
over for a party.

512
00:20:53,469 --> 00:20:54,775
Uh, El?

513
00:20:54,818 --> 00:20:56,516
Eliot?

514
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,300
Eliot, you good?

515
00:20:58,344 --> 00:21:00,433
- Yeah, yea... yeah.
- Yeah.

516
00:21:00,476 --> 00:21:02,739
Just can't wait to see
this amazing moon rock.

517
00:21:02,783 --> 00:21:04,350
Don't worry.

518
00:21:04,393 --> 00:21:08,005
You both will experience Her.

519
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,543
What a cozy little nightmare.

520
00:21:23,586 --> 00:21:25,458
I might need you to punch me
to stay awake.

521
00:21:25,501 --> 00:21:26,459
Gotcha.

522
00:21:26,502 --> 00:21:27,808
Isn't She wondrous?

523
00:21:27,851 --> 00:21:28,809
Yeah, definitely.

524
00:21:28,852 --> 00:21:30,047
Think we can turn on the lights

525
00:21:30,071 --> 00:21:31,725
and turn off the yoga music?

526
00:21:31,768 --> 00:21:35,337
You got this
from the moon... how?

527
00:21:35,381 --> 00:21:36,730
I went.

528
00:21:36,773 --> 00:21:39,298
You just went to the moon
like it was Coney Island?

529
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:41,648
Yeah, actually,
it was pretty tough.

530
00:21:41,691 --> 00:21:44,390
To be honest, I was trying
to impress someone.

531
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:47,610
But in the end,
our souls did not connect.

532
00:21:48,524 --> 00:21:50,483
Yeah, we need to ask a favor.

533
00:21:50,526 --> 00:21:53,399
For my fellow Lunatics,
I would move Heaven and Earth.

534
00:21:53,442 --> 00:21:55,096
About that...

535
00:21:55,139 --> 00:21:57,074
Yeah, look, we know
this rock is special to you...

536
00:21:57,098 --> 00:21:59,405
- Super special.
- But we need it.

537
00:21:59,448 --> 00:22:02,059
To move Her.
Hence the moon brain.

538
00:22:02,103 --> 00:22:03,602
You do know what that
would do, right?

539
00:22:03,626 --> 00:22:05,300
Yes, but it's a matter
of life and death.

540
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,760
We can stop
the Harmonic Convergence

541
00:22:06,803 --> 00:22:09,197
if we can hold the moon
out of position long enough.

542
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,198
Why?

543
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:11,393
Because it's going to cause

544
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:12,853
worldwide destruction.

545
00:22:12,896 --> 00:22:15,334
Magic will become so powerful,
it'll be apocalyptic.

546
00:22:15,377 --> 00:22:16,509
I mean, it's not like

547
00:22:16,552 --> 00:22:19,163
it's gonna wipe out
all life on Earth.

548
00:22:19,207 --> 00:22:20,382
Just some.

549
00:22:20,426 --> 00:22:22,428
You know exactly
how bad it's going to get,

550
00:22:22,471 --> 00:22:23,907
don't you?

551
00:22:23,951 --> 00:22:25,581
What, are you planning to
profit off this or something?

552
00:22:25,605 --> 00:22:27,389
I'm planning to use my resources

553
00:22:27,433 --> 00:22:28,695
to help the world recover.

554
00:22:28,738 --> 00:22:30,392
Now, I'm an entrepreneurial
spirit.

555
00:22:30,436 --> 00:22:32,351
I can't help but make money.

556
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:33,395
Now, I do think that

557
00:22:33,439 --> 00:22:35,528
the moon brain
is getting to you.

558
00:22:35,571 --> 00:22:37,268
Unless...

559
00:22:39,532 --> 00:22:43,231
Mm, your eye tattoo
is illusion magic.

560
00:22:43,274 --> 00:22:45,189
You're no Lunatic at all.

561
00:22:45,233 --> 00:22:47,322
I'll have my guards
escort you out.

562
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,238
Let's go, El. We tried.

563
00:22:50,281 --> 00:22:52,240
Happens all the time.

564
00:22:59,639 --> 00:23:02,424
- Get it?
- All of it.

565
00:23:03,469 --> 00:23:04,600
We have a problem.

566
00:23:04,644 --> 00:23:06,167
So it's just security cameras

567
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,405
until we get
to the moon rock room,

568
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:09,126
and that's where it gets tough.

569
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:11,346
One way in, one way out.

570
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,609
I mean, if we get caught,
we're trapped.

571
00:23:14,741 --> 00:23:17,178
Guys. Guys!

572
00:23:18,484 --> 00:23:21,356
Thanks!

573
00:23:23,706 --> 00:23:25,926
So... the rock.

574
00:23:25,969 --> 00:23:28,581
Whole lotta wards around it,
nothing we can't get past,

575
00:23:28,624 --> 00:23:30,800
except for the one
on the rock itself.

576
00:23:30,844 --> 00:23:33,934
It's... well, it's a bond
that we've never seen before,

577
00:23:33,977 --> 00:23:35,718
put there by Mayakovsky.

578
00:23:35,762 --> 00:23:37,894
Well, that can't be right.

579
00:23:37,938 --> 00:23:39,548
Oren just got the rock.

580
00:23:39,592 --> 00:23:41,158
And didn't you say the last time

581
00:23:41,202 --> 00:23:43,726
you saw Mayakovsky,
he was basically senile?

582
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:45,467
Yeah, well,
I guess he got better.

583
00:23:45,511 --> 00:23:47,469
I mean, he...
He put his signature

584
00:23:47,513 --> 00:23:48,838
into the lattice work
of the spell.

585
00:23:48,862 --> 00:23:49,819
You can't miss it.

586
00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:51,299
It's the most amazing,

587
00:23:51,342 --> 00:23:53,432
most narcissistic thing
I've ever seen.

588
00:23:54,955 --> 00:23:56,391
Mm.

589
00:23:57,871 --> 00:24:00,613
- Hey, Eliot?
- Hm?

590
00:24:00,656 --> 00:24:03,267
- Can I talk to you for a sec?
- Yeah.

591
00:24:03,311 --> 00:24:04,834
I said I'm fine.

592
00:24:06,575 --> 00:24:10,187
I have been awake for
thousands of hours straight.

593
00:24:10,231 --> 00:24:11,928
Look, I saw your moment
back there,

594
00:24:11,972 --> 00:24:13,669
and I think I might
know what's up.

595
00:24:13,713 --> 00:24:16,716
You think you do, but you don't.

596
00:24:18,544 --> 00:24:21,503
Okay, so the first
two nights, no sleep,

597
00:24:21,547 --> 00:24:23,200
things got
a little weird, right?

598
00:24:23,244 --> 00:24:26,203
Like picking up my phone
to call Quentin.

599
00:24:26,247 --> 00:24:28,249
You know, I must've done that
like five times.

600
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:33,297
But then my brain
crossed over into darker...

601
00:24:34,908 --> 00:24:37,606
Here's the deal.

602
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,522
When the Sister was in me,

603
00:24:40,566 --> 00:24:42,002
I remember everything.

604
00:24:42,045 --> 00:24:44,700
Every bloody second of it.

605
00:24:44,744 --> 00:24:47,224
And usually,
I'm good at pushing it away,

606
00:24:47,268 --> 00:24:49,749
but right now...

607
00:24:49,792 --> 00:24:52,926
it is like a constant slideshow
in the background.

608
00:24:52,969 --> 00:24:55,755
Not fun. El.

609
00:24:55,798 --> 00:24:58,584
The Monster was
in you for months.

610
00:25:00,281 --> 00:25:01,891
Well, it was different.

611
00:25:03,414 --> 00:25:05,591
People have
different experiences.

612
00:25:05,634 --> 00:25:08,419
All that time was just
one big nap to me,

613
00:25:08,463 --> 00:25:10,813
which... sounds so good
right now.

614
00:25:12,772 --> 00:25:14,817
I don't know
why you're lying to me.

615
00:25:14,861 --> 00:25:16,471
Or anyone.

616
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:19,822
I don't know why
you're accusing me of lying.

617
00:25:21,345 --> 00:25:22,956
Okay.

618
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:25,698
Neither of us have the
bandwidth for this right now,

619
00:25:25,741 --> 00:25:27,613
and I don't trust you.

620
00:25:27,656 --> 00:25:29,658
I don't.

621
00:25:29,702 --> 00:25:32,052
But if you ever
do decide to talk,

622
00:25:32,095 --> 00:25:33,836
open door.

623
00:25:50,287 --> 00:25:51,550
Shit.

624
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:53,813
If I may,
lenses can be sensitive

625
00:25:53,856 --> 00:25:55,728
to changes
in your Internal Circumstances.

626
00:25:55,771 --> 00:25:58,034
You may need to adjust
if you're feeling off.

627
00:25:59,253 --> 00:26:00,863
God damn it.

628
00:26:00,907 --> 00:26:02,058
If something is bothering you,

629
00:26:02,082 --> 00:26:03,866
I know I'm not the ideal
person to talk to,

630
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,172
but I am here.

631
00:26:05,215 --> 00:26:08,305
I'm not feeling chatty
at the moment, okay?

632
00:26:14,268 --> 00:26:15,985
Look, you're not the only one
that made a mistake,

633
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:18,881
'cause clearly
it's still bothering me.

634
00:26:20,883 --> 00:26:22,276
It's Fogg.

635
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,322
He's stuck in the Etheric Realm,

636
00:26:25,366 --> 00:26:28,412
and it's my fault.

637
00:26:28,456 --> 00:26:29,805
Henry's in...

638
00:26:31,894 --> 00:26:34,201
He always was a sensualist.

639
00:26:34,244 --> 00:26:38,074
That place is a trap for people
like him, who enjoy, well...

640
00:26:38,118 --> 00:26:40,294
- Getting wasted?
- Mm.

641
00:26:40,337 --> 00:26:42,862
He was trying to quit.

642
00:26:42,905 --> 00:26:44,013
He shouldn't have even
been in there.

643
00:26:44,037 --> 00:26:45,429
He was only in there
because of me.

644
00:26:45,473 --> 00:26:46,909
And you were only there

645
00:26:46,953 --> 00:26:49,172
because you wanted
to help the hedges.

646
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,958
You know,
if we're being honest...

647
00:26:53,481 --> 00:26:56,266
I wanted to get high.

648
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,791
Lucky me, that's the only way
into the Etheric Realm.

649
00:27:00,183 --> 00:27:02,316
Fogg just...

650
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:04,361
tagged along and got unlucky.

651
00:27:04,405 --> 00:27:06,189
That wasn't luck.

652
00:27:06,233 --> 00:27:08,017
I know the Emperor of the Realm.

653
00:27:08,061 --> 00:27:09,366
If he kept Henry behind,

654
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:11,281
it was because
he sensed a flaw in him.

655
00:27:11,325 --> 00:27:12,674
And if he kicked you out,

656
00:27:12,718 --> 00:27:16,286
it was because you were trying
to do something good.

657
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,201
Nothing bores him like goodness.

658
00:27:18,245 --> 00:27:19,855
Yeah, how do you know that?

659
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:22,292
I spent three years there once.

660
00:27:22,336 --> 00:27:24,077
Jesus.

661
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:30,431
Before I came to the Library,
my life was... difficult.

662
00:27:31,998 --> 00:27:34,130
The Etheric Realm was an escape.

663
00:27:34,174 --> 00:27:36,132
How did you get out?

664
00:27:36,176 --> 00:27:39,962
- I stopped hating myself.
- Eventually.

665
00:27:40,006 --> 00:27:42,486
And then the Emperor
grew bored with me.

666
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:45,402
Whatever kept Henry there,
those were his demons,

667
00:27:45,446 --> 00:27:48,841
and that is something
you couldn't fix.

668
00:27:48,884 --> 00:27:51,167
Well, it doesn't stop me from
feeling like shit about it.

669
00:27:51,191 --> 00:27:53,672
The fact that
you feel like shit,

670
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:56,500
that is why you escaped.

671
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:59,242
So allow me to be blunt.

672
00:27:59,286 --> 00:28:02,376
Don't waste time on self-pity.

673
00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:04,247
Do what you came to do.

674
00:28:05,901 --> 00:28:06,902
Thanks.

675
00:28:09,426 --> 00:28:11,341
I'll try to be less
of a bitch to you.

676
00:28:11,385 --> 00:28:13,996
Mm. If you can.

677
00:28:23,484 --> 00:28:25,529
It's working.

678
00:28:25,573 --> 00:28:27,401
I can see the wards.

679
00:28:27,444 --> 00:28:28,576
This way.

680
00:28:35,975 --> 00:28:38,586
It sounds like he's home.
Look, fair warning...

681
00:28:45,071 --> 00:28:46,072
Who the hell are you?

682
00:28:46,115 --> 00:28:47,987
We're looking for Mayakovsky.

683
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:50,076
Old, drunk, megalomaniac?

684
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:52,034
Fondness for knit caps?

685
00:28:52,078 --> 00:28:53,209
Yeah, I'm his daughter.

686
00:28:53,253 --> 00:28:54,907
I didn't realize he...

687
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,604
- Fucked my mother?
- Neither did he.

688
00:28:56,647 --> 00:28:59,215
Should've seen his face
when I came knockin'.

689
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:02,044
But we're fine now.
What do you want?

690
00:29:02,088 --> 00:29:03,480
Can you let us down?

691
00:29:03,524 --> 00:29:05,091
Sure.

692
00:29:07,093 --> 00:29:08,181
Thanks.

693
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:11,445
Look.

694
00:29:11,488 --> 00:29:13,447
We need to talk to your dad.

695
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:16,145
He's busy.

696
00:29:16,189 --> 00:29:17,451
On our project.

697
00:29:17,494 --> 00:29:19,409
Look, we think he may
be the only person

698
00:29:19,453 --> 00:29:20,733
that can help us save the world.

699
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,979
He put a special magical bond
on a moon rock,

700
00:29:24,023 --> 00:29:25,938
and we need his help
to break it.

701
00:29:25,981 --> 00:29:29,985
Wait, please tell me you're
trying to rob Oren Westbrook.

702
00:29:30,029 --> 00:29:32,683
- How do you know that?
- I installed that bond.

703
00:29:32,727 --> 00:29:36,165
Yeah, last nice thing I did
before I dumped his greasy ass.

704
00:29:36,209 --> 00:29:37,689
- That was you?
- What? You dated him?

705
00:29:37,732 --> 00:29:40,082
Don't judge, but yes.

706
00:29:40,126 --> 00:29:42,084
Anyfuck, right after
I installed the bond,

707
00:29:42,128 --> 00:29:43,607
I caught the maid pegging him,

708
00:29:43,651 --> 00:29:47,002
and not the maid
I okayed for threesomes.

709
00:29:47,046 --> 00:29:48,395
- Mm...
- Okay.

710
00:29:48,438 --> 00:29:50,136
So that means you'll help us?

711
00:29:51,572 --> 00:29:52,616
I could.

712
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,618
But I need something from you.

713
00:29:54,662 --> 00:29:57,099
A shade.

714
00:29:57,143 --> 00:30:00,059
Either of yours will do.

715
00:30:00,102 --> 00:30:02,409
What are you gonna do with it?

716
00:30:02,452 --> 00:30:05,325
- Are we gonna get it back?
- No.

717
00:30:05,368 --> 00:30:07,153
- You want my help?
- Mm-hmm.

718
00:30:07,196 --> 00:30:09,982
One shade, payment in advance.

719
00:30:10,025 --> 00:30:11,331
Discuss.

720
00:30:23,386 --> 00:30:26,172
- It's safe.
- Thanks.

721
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:35,834
Any idea where to find
a medical manual in here?

722
00:30:35,877 --> 00:30:37,748
Unfortunately,
the organizational systems

723
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:39,707
are down, so it may...

724
00:30:48,716 --> 00:30:50,587
May I?

725
00:30:55,592 --> 00:30:57,681
Hm.

726
00:30:59,553 --> 00:31:02,512
Sometimes I forget you're
a fucking master Magician.

727
00:31:02,556 --> 00:31:04,558
I try to keep the showboating
to a minimum.

728
00:31:04,601 --> 00:31:06,536
Well, the Harmonic
Convergence is in a few hours.

729
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,604
You know what that means.

730
00:31:07,648 --> 00:31:09,780
I'll take this to Harriet ASAP.

731
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:14,350
Tell her if, God forbid,
we can't stop it...

732
00:31:14,394 --> 00:31:16,794
we might need all the hedges we
can get to unfuck everything.

733
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,551
Desperate times, huh?

734
00:31:41,595 --> 00:31:43,118
Didn't really have much choice.

735
00:31:43,162 --> 00:31:45,468
Hey, uh, Julia?

736
00:31:45,512 --> 00:31:48,167
Can you remind me why
I'm dressed like this, please?

737
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,361
He's been like this all night.

738
00:31:49,385 --> 00:31:50,865
Just running on muffin fumes.

739
00:31:52,432 --> 00:31:54,323
Okay, let's just make sure
we're all on the same page.

740
00:31:54,347 --> 00:31:57,219
Okay?
Okay, so Josh, Margo, Penny.

741
00:31:57,263 --> 00:31:59,134
You guys go inside,
loop all the cameras,

742
00:31:59,178 --> 00:32:00,657
open the side door for Natasha.

743
00:32:00,701 --> 00:32:03,095
I'll be outside waiting
with Eliot and Alice.

744
00:32:03,138 --> 00:32:04,792
We won't cast the spell
until your signal.

745
00:32:04,835 --> 00:32:06,359
You won't miss it. Ready?

746
00:32:06,402 --> 00:32:07,621
Break.

747
00:32:13,801 --> 00:32:16,543
- Eliot.
- What are you staring at?

748
00:32:18,458 --> 00:32:21,591
Pull the ripcord, get out.
We'll handle this.

749
00:32:21,635 --> 00:32:22,941
I am not cocking out.

750
00:32:22,984 --> 00:32:25,160
You're not right, El,
and we both know why.

751
00:32:25,204 --> 00:32:27,946
My crippling fear of/
attraction to authority?

752
00:32:27,989 --> 00:32:30,252
Are you being honest with me?

753
00:32:30,296 --> 00:32:32,776
Bambi, always.

754
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,667
I don't care if you've
been keeping it from me,

755
00:32:34,691 --> 00:32:36,476
but all of our asses
are on the line now.

756
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:38,260
Margo.

757
00:32:38,304 --> 00:32:39,609
Do not worry about me.

758
00:32:39,653 --> 00:32:41,785
I know, I've been
a little bit off.

759
00:32:41,829 --> 00:32:43,396
Blame it on the moon brain.

760
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:45,833
I promise I'm fine.

761
00:32:48,314 --> 00:32:49,315
'Kay?

762
00:33:19,823 --> 00:33:21,434
Hey! How are you?

763
00:33:29,355 --> 00:33:30,355
Oh.

764
00:33:35,796 --> 00:33:37,319
Uh, no guests.

765
00:33:37,363 --> 00:33:39,843
Can you fetch me another
plate of those crab puffs?

766
00:33:39,887 --> 00:33:41,106
Delish.

767
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:43,021
- Head of security.
- Not your waiter.

768
00:33:43,064 --> 00:33:44,979
Oh, good for you.

769
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,285
Have you tried the crab puffs?

770
00:33:49,984 --> 00:33:51,681
- Hey, my drink!
- What the...

771
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:53,074
Watch the suit!

772
00:33:53,118 --> 00:33:55,207
That's the third time
you've done that tonight!

773
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,860
Watch what you're doing!

774
00:33:56,904 --> 00:33:58,186
I'm gonna take you outside
right now.

775
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:00,777
All right, fellas,
break it up, break it up.

776
00:34:08,176 --> 00:34:09,743
I looped that one,

777
00:34:09,786 --> 00:34:11,329
but I don't remember
if I looped that one.

778
00:34:11,353 --> 00:34:13,355
You don't remember
five seconds ago?

779
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:16,837
Josh, I haven't had
short-term memory in two days.

780
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,925
The only things I remember

781
00:34:17,968 --> 00:34:19,120
are being worried about Eliot

782
00:34:19,144 --> 00:34:20,145
and feeling like shit

783
00:34:20,188 --> 00:34:22,234
for trying to leave you
in the past.

784
00:34:22,277 --> 00:34:23,713
Really?

785
00:34:25,237 --> 00:34:28,153
Fucking moon brain.

786
00:34:28,196 --> 00:34:29,719
Totally spaced out.

787
00:34:29,763 --> 00:34:31,199
Why are you looking at me
like that?

788
00:34:31,243 --> 00:34:33,245
These are good.

789
00:34:36,335 --> 00:34:37,336
Let's go.

790
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:45,083
It's true. It's true.

791
00:34:46,127 --> 00:34:47,955
Excuse me, sir.

792
00:34:47,998 --> 00:34:49,870
Excuse me.

793
00:34:49,913 --> 00:34:51,741
We have an issue.

794
00:34:51,785 --> 00:34:53,178
Natasha?

795
00:34:53,221 --> 00:34:54,788
What the hell is she doing here?

796
00:34:54,831 --> 00:34:57,138
Well, my men will find out,
but I have a hunch.

797
00:34:57,182 --> 00:35:00,141
There's one thing you own
that only she can steal.

798
00:35:14,851 --> 00:35:17,811
Bring back the rock.

799
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:24,774
- Stop!
- Wh...

800
00:35:25,471 --> 00:35:26,776
Right there, right there!

801
00:35:29,301 --> 00:35:30,301
Let's go!

802
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:40,399
Natasha. Where is she going?

803
00:35:40,442 --> 00:35:43,967
For the last time,
we don't know.

804
00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:46,796
And even if we did,
we would never admit it.

805
00:35:48,276 --> 00:35:50,191
No bother.

806
00:35:50,235 --> 00:35:52,802
My men have her now.

807
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:07,121
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What's going on?

808
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,254
- Where's the moon rock?
- What... I don't...

809
00:36:09,297 --> 00:36:10,298
I don't know!

810
00:36:10,342 --> 00:36:11,647
Look, I was just hitchhiking,

811
00:36:11,691 --> 00:36:14,084
and a woman, she just
threw the keys at me, okay?

812
00:36:14,128 --> 00:36:15,956
Just take the van, whatever.

813
00:36:18,001 --> 00:36:19,351
Look, she went that way.

814
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,965
She escaped?

815
00:36:25,008 --> 00:36:26,271
Where's the rock?

816
00:36:35,018 --> 00:36:37,499
Well, I officially
have moon brain.

817
00:36:37,543 --> 00:36:40,241
I can see Her aura. It's red.

818
00:36:41,111 --> 00:36:43,592
Let's do this quick
before anyone comes in.

819
00:36:43,636 --> 00:36:45,353
How long do we have to cast
the first part again?

820
00:36:45,377 --> 00:36:48,989
Until Her aura turns green
and She's listening.

821
00:37:05,092 --> 00:37:07,094
It's working.

822
00:37:12,491 --> 00:37:15,276
Where is Natasha
taking the rock?

823
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,235
Okay... okay.

824
00:37:17,278 --> 00:37:19,411
She said she was going
to Philly.

825
00:37:19,454 --> 00:37:22,457
The only thing worse
than a traitor is a snitch.

826
00:37:22,501 --> 00:37:24,067
You make me wanna puke.

827
00:37:24,111 --> 00:37:25,634
Hey, hey, Josh.

828
00:37:25,678 --> 00:37:27,549
Do you have any more muffins?

829
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,252
Almost there.

830
00:37:40,388 --> 00:37:41,694
We had it.

831
00:37:41,737 --> 00:37:42,956
What happened?

832
00:37:42,999 --> 00:37:45,132
How did it turn red?

833
00:37:45,175 --> 00:37:46,394
Eliot?

834
00:37:46,438 --> 00:37:47,830
Wait, Eliot, come back!

835
00:37:47,874 --> 00:37:50,050
We don't have enough power
to finish this without you.

836
00:37:50,746 --> 00:37:52,270
Eliot.

837
00:37:54,141 --> 00:37:55,316
Eliot...

838
00:37:57,362 --> 00:38:00,147
Let me out.

839
00:38:24,911 --> 00:38:27,914
You're not there.

840
00:38:27,957 --> 00:38:29,655
You're gone forever.

841
00:38:30,525 --> 00:38:32,919
Quentin threw you in the Seam.

842
00:38:38,098 --> 00:38:41,101
This isn't happening.
This is moon brain.

843
00:38:49,022 --> 00:38:50,545
Stop right there!

844
00:38:55,507 --> 00:38:58,945
My guards are in the room
with your friends.

845
00:38:58,988 --> 00:39:00,686
The rock never left, did it?

846
00:39:01,991 --> 00:39:03,602
You know, I want the snitch

847
00:39:03,645 --> 00:39:06,344
to tell me what's
really going on.

848
00:39:09,042 --> 00:39:11,610
- What happened?
- Asshole fell asleep again.

849
00:39:11,653 --> 00:39:14,569
His fight-or-flight response
is to take a fucking nap.

850
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,407
Or something else is up.

851
00:39:29,976 --> 00:39:31,543
It wasn't me.

852
00:39:34,633 --> 00:39:36,417
In here, boss.

853
00:39:39,507 --> 00:39:42,467
Marina.

854
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,077
Ladies.

855
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:47,907
Did you put the guards to sleep?

856
00:39:47,950 --> 00:39:50,518
Yeah, but I'm a little confused

857
00:39:50,562 --> 00:39:52,128
why you aren't snoozing too.

858
00:39:52,172 --> 00:39:54,827
The only thing stronger
than that spell is...

859
00:39:56,437 --> 00:39:58,657
Oh, my God. Are you on meth?

860
00:40:00,223 --> 00:40:03,444
You know,
it sure as hell seems like it.

861
00:40:11,539 --> 00:40:12,845
What are you doing here?

862
00:40:12,888 --> 00:40:14,455
Keeping you from
fucking up my shit.

863
00:40:14,499 --> 00:40:17,066
Harmonic Convergence, I need it.

864
00:40:19,591 --> 00:40:22,898
Like Daddy always said,
even meth can't beat handcuffs.

865
00:40:22,942 --> 00:40:24,920
I don't think you understand
how bad the Convergence is.

866
00:40:24,944 --> 00:40:26,902
No, I do.

867
00:40:26,946 --> 00:40:30,210
But what you don't understand
is how good it is for me.

868
00:40:30,253 --> 00:40:31,907
I have a very critical mission,

869
00:40:31,951 --> 00:40:33,831
and I need the power
convergence boost to do it.

870
00:40:33,866 --> 00:40:38,174
So just this one time,
could you please go home?

871
00:40:38,218 --> 00:40:39,872
Look,
whatever it is you're doing,

872
00:40:39,915 --> 00:40:41,613
it's not worth the world.

873
00:40:41,656 --> 00:40:42,788
Mm, yes, it is.

874
00:40:42,831 --> 00:40:44,113
I put a shitload
of work into this.

875
00:40:44,137 --> 00:40:46,705
I stole a Book Depository,
for Christ sake.

876
00:40:46,748 --> 00:40:49,055
That was you?

877
00:40:49,098 --> 00:40:51,710
You sent that memory assassin
after me.

878
00:40:51,753 --> 00:40:53,494
Yeah, and not a life assassin.

879
00:40:53,538 --> 00:40:54,800
You're welcome.

880
00:40:54,843 --> 00:40:58,456
We're even, since you
tipped us to this party.

881
00:40:58,499 --> 00:41:00,196
Frederick here...
That's not my name.

882
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,461
Okay, not-Frederick here,

883
00:41:03,504 --> 00:41:05,114
overheard you
in my Book Depository

884
00:41:05,158 --> 00:41:07,726
making these exciting plans
for the Convergence.

885
00:41:07,769 --> 00:41:09,205
Speaking of...

886
00:41:09,249 --> 00:41:10,772
just started.

887
00:41:13,645 --> 00:41:16,125
I flinch, it fires.

888
00:41:17,779 --> 00:41:19,520
Oh...

889
00:41:19,564 --> 00:41:20,956
I think we all
know what that was.

890
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,218
It's the surge.

891
00:41:22,262 --> 00:41:23,282
You know what that means,
Chickee-poo?

892
00:41:23,306 --> 00:41:24,830
Power is insane.

893
00:41:24,873 --> 00:41:26,527
You're holding a nuke right now.

894
00:41:26,571 --> 00:41:28,616
You let that thing go,
we all go bye-bye.

895
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:31,010
Kady, she's right; With
the Convergence and the surge,

896
00:41:31,053 --> 00:41:33,055
every spell is, like,
super-powered right now.

897
00:41:33,099 --> 00:41:35,580
Yeah, I bet you could
cast something solo

898
00:41:35,623 --> 00:41:37,538
that would normally
take three people.

899
00:41:37,582 --> 00:41:39,932
- Isn't that what I just said?
- Marina!

900
00:41:39,975 --> 00:41:42,543
Please, we are so close
to saving everyone.

901
00:41:42,587 --> 00:41:44,173
You can't just
take that away from us now.

902
00:41:44,197 --> 00:41:45,851
Whatever it is you're after,

903
00:41:45,894 --> 00:41:47,940
what's the point
if there's no world?

904
00:41:47,983 --> 00:41:51,770
There'll still be a world,
just not as many people.

905
00:41:51,813 --> 00:41:53,859
- Have you met people?
- She's listening!

906
00:41:53,902 --> 00:41:55,556
Eliot, go!

907
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,037
- The fuck are you doing?
- I've got it.

908
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,126
- You're moving the moon?
- Yeah.

909
00:42:00,169 --> 00:42:02,128
I'm moving it back.

910
00:42:32,811 --> 00:42:34,943
Uh...

911
00:42:34,987 --> 00:42:36,205
guys?

912
00:42:41,036 --> 00:42:43,735
I think we just broke the moon.

913
00:42:48,653 --> 00:42:50,785
Ah, shit.
