All you have to do is move...

36
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,041
that.

37
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,479
The Harmonic Convergence.

38
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,319
- AKA the end of the world.
- Not necessarily.

39
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,779
This constellation forms a cosmic sigil

40
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,880

41
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:37,472

43
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:42,477
So we get the disaster movie

44
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:45,813
The Convergence will only occur
during this perfect alignment.

45
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,559
If we move the moon out of position...

46

No Convergence, no Circumstance,

47
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,620
no apocalypse.

48
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,579
The moon is not just a rock in space.
It has certain properties.

49
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,492
- Like?
- Magic doesn't work on it.

50
00:01:57,493 --> 00:01:59,949
Thanks to Magicians
casting haphazardly on it

51
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,349
for millennia, the moon is
now covered by a crust

52
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,519
of spell debris, blocking new spells.

53
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,544
If we move any piece out
of place, no Convergence.

54
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:09,940
Well, what if we just moved Mars?

55
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:12,423
She said with a straight face.

56
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:14,801
The other pieces are planets.

57
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:16,829
We can't move them
because they are, well,

58
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,640
very big and far away.

59
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,279
The moon is the only celestial body

60

62
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,353

63
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:26,809
Impossible to know.

64
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,358
It will be a brand-new Circumstance.

65
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,279
But to get to that problem,
we need to solve this one.

66
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,979
Good, well, I hope you have some ideas,

67
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,198
because we're striking out.

68
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:38,701
I do. Consult the Lunatics.

69
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,412
- The lunatics?
- Short for "Lunar Fanatics."

70
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:45,299
In the Middle Ages,
people thought insanity

71
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,339
was caused by changing
phases of the moon.

72
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,378
In fact, it was often a Lunatic
in the throes of worship.

73
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:53,499
They claimed to be able to
achieve a magical connection

74
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,139
with the moon and even under
some circumstances...

75
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:57,169
move it.

76
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,679
Well, that sounds useful.

77
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,579
- Mm.
- Well, if it's just branding,

78
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,267
it means they're not
really crazy, right?

79
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:06,359
My dad always said that
they were batshit insane,

80
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,799
and he married my mom,
so he had a pretty high bar

81
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,919
for mental instability.

82
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,379
Regardless, they know more
about the moon than anyone.

83
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,859
I believe that talking to them
is our only chance at success.

You don't move Her.

116
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,615
You ask Her to move.

117
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:46,035
And She won't let you speak to
Her unless you get moon brain.

118
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:47,912

00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,629
So it's a cooperative spell then.

123
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:58,756
It is a sign of respect, Kneecap,

124
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:01,384
that allows you to see
Her as She truly is.

125
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:04,229
If you have moon brain,
then you will see Her aura.

Now it is red, but when you
perform the Dianic Ritual,

127

Her aura will change.

128
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,329
If it is yellow, She is considering.

129
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:11,679
If it is green, She is listening.

130
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,709
Only then may you ask Her

131
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,949

139
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:35,159
A warning: once Her aura is green,
She may choose to listen

140
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,503
to anyone who calls to Her, so be ready.

141
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:40,004
You must choose one,
the strongest among you,

142
00:05:40,005 --> 00:05:42,843
to speak to Her, like the
old Lunatics taught us to.

143
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,679
For this second part,
however, there is a price.

144
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,680
- A price, like blood?
- It is like blood to Her.

145
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:52,810
You will need a piece
of Her. A sacrifice.

146
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,779
A piece?

147
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,981
- Or like a moon rock?
- Yes.

148
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:59,259
But be aware,

149
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,289

Of course, that's a thing here.

180
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,329
Yeah, and uh... [CLEARS THROAT]

181
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,851
That makes me acting Dean Lipson.

182
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,269
There's no instruction manual,

183
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,969
so I'm kinda dean-ing on the fly here,

184
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,099
but one thing I do know

185
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,499
is losing a professor who was disabled

186
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,020
on school grounds ain't happening.

187
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,579
I mean, the optics would
be pure shitflakes.

188
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:30,450
So your contract will be
honored and enforced.

189
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,740
Oh, also.

190
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,915
We need a new Welters coach.

191
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,789
I've been on the inside,
and I'm telling you

192
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,335
it's a goddamn goose-stepping,

193
00:07:44,336 --> 00:07:47,091
fairy-snatching, ethnic
cleansing Gestapo.

194
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:49,299
To be fair, the ethnic
cleansing happened

195
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,220
after the Dark King left, so...

196
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,181
He's innocent because he delegates?

197
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:54,719
No, that's not what I'm saying.

198
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,099
Someone in this castle ordered
the hunt on that Fairy.

199
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,439
It could have been the Dark King,

200
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,839
but if it was someone else,

201
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,647
killing Seb might just
make things worse.

202
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:06,862
So we have to find out
who before we... coup.

203
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,990
I just wanna stab someone.

204
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,289
I haven't heard you
this bloodthirsty in...

205
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,786
well, not that long,
but still, it's notable.

206
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:18,329
Maybe I'm a bit on edge.

207
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,207
Josh keeps wanting to talk.

208
00:08:20,208 --> 00:08:21,399
You mean about how you wanted

209
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,499
to leave him in the past to die?

210
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,920
Yeah, that.

211
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,139
So far, I'm doing a good
job of avoiding him,

212
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,799
but eventually he's gonna sneak...

213
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,009
Guys.

214
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,579
- Hey, what's up?
- 'Sup?

215
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,009
First off, kudos on the hiding spot.

216
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:35,223
It took me forever to find you.

217
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:36,640
Pretty busy here, Josh.

218
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,649
You're busy?

219
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,851
I just got promoted to head chef.

220
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,049
- Oh, congratulations.
- Thank you.

221
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:42,979
But I'm about to bail on a state dinner

222
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,519
and leave it to my incompetent
sous-chef because...

223
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,389
Apocalypse! Now!

224
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,299
Josh, would you just give it up?

225
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,988
He keeps trying to get us
to join his film club,

226
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,698
which I told him would
never work on a planet

227
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,742
with no electricity or taste.

228
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:57,995
Uh, no, uh, sorry.
This one's just a little shy.

229
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,439
It... it's okay, buddy.

230
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,959
- Help us stop the...
- Apocalypse! Now!

231
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,260
- Oh.
- We need to get back to Earth.

232
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,839
Margo, our talk will have to wait

233
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,509
till after we save the world.

234
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,719
Oh, but then I have my
nephew's bar mitzvah.

235
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,345
So after that?

236
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,180
- Mazel.
- Thanks.

237
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,289
[SIGHS]

238
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:21,449
What about our thing? We have
a lot of fact-finding to do

239
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,104
before I can get to stabbing.

240
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:24,559
No problem.

241
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,273
I know just who to handle it.

242
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,025
<i>You want me to what?</i>

243
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:31,329
Just find out who in the
castle hates Fairies.

244
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,569
Okay? And what they're doing to them.

245
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,282
And why Fairies in the first place?

246
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:38,199
And maybe talk to some Fairies,
get their side of things.

247
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,479
- Okay.
- And while you're at it...

248
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,207
anything else that seems important.

249
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,119
Okay, okay, okay.

250
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,590
No, um... That seems like a
lot of open-ended questions.

251
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,599
- Mm-hmm.
- I got this maid job

252
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,699
to be close to you guys,

253
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:52,239
and now you're deserting me? [CHUCKLES]

254
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,636
I want to stop an apocalypse too.

255
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,819
Every apocalypse-stopping mission

256
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,849
needs a maid on the outside.

257
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:01,859
It's a key staple in Earth movies.

258
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,019
Do you mean inside man?

259
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,728
'Cause that's more of
a heist movie thing.

260
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,069
- No, that's different.
- Okay.

261
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,199
Everyone knows

262
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,139
the "secret, sexy maid
on the outside" trope.

263
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,179
- Yeah?
- Josh has a film club.

264
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,409
- You should check it out.
- Huh.

265
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:18,900
Maid on the outside. Yeah.

266
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,660
So did your loony friend
say how to get moon brain?

267
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,549
From what we read, her rituals

268
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,059
are simple first-year Popper tuts.

269
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,589
But moon brain is...

270
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:33,174
the insanity you get from
extreme sleep deprivation.

271
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:35,759
Extreme, like a night partying,
or what are we talking about?

272
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,269
I wish.

273
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,846
Five nights without sleep,

274
00:10:38,847 --> 00:10:41,069
and we can't use magic
to stay awake either.

275
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,434
Apparently, moon brain has
to come about naturally.

276
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,469
This is completely nuts.

277
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:48,279
Isn't the Harmonic whatever
happening in five nights?

278
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,449
Yes, so if we all start tonight,

279
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,359
we might actually have
a shot at stopping it.

280
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,469
Wait a minute. [LAUGHS]

281
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,280
Five nights without sleep is
gonna fuck us up royally.

282
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:59,283
Can we even cast if
we're that messed up?

283
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,826
Well, three of us have to.

284
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,659
Look, guys, I know it sucks,

285
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:07,359
but whoever can stay up for 132 hours

286
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,377
without sleep and not lose their shit...

287
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,546
gets to stop the apocalypse.

288
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,209
I don't know about you guys,
but I am doing great.

289
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,940
- _
- Coffee.

290
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,459
Where's our fearless leader?

291
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:26,059
- _
- She's taking a cold shower

292
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,089
to keep herself awake.

293
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,369
Third... fourth time this morning.

294
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,440
Well, I don't know about you guys,

295
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,609
but I am too excited to sleep.

296
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,260
I mean, we're doing it!

297
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,905
Is this, uh, helping
you find moon rocks?

298
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,379
Mm.

299
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,319
No, this is helping us stay awake.

300
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,839
The moment I research,
I'm out like a light.

301
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,870
Know what might help?

302
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:48,207
If we make this party a
little more '80s themed.

303
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,619

304
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,249
Oh, I don't think we should.

305
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,255
If we ski the fresh
powder, know what I mean?

306
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:57,383
- Yeah, I get it.
- I mean cocaine.

307
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,759
Get me cocaine.

308
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,919
- I am not getting you cocaine.
- <i>Eliot.</i>

309
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,719
A five-day bender would
destroy your nose,

310
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,599
and could you imagine what that would do

311
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,609
to your sense of taste?

312
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:06,979
I get a full nine every night,

313
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:09,079
and I'm still a bitch.
This is gonna get real.

314
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,019
Hey, guys, come check this out.

00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:14,441
<i>[SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC]</i>

316
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,193
I found something.

317
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:18,379
NASA brought back a bunch of moon rocks

318
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,560
from the Apollo missions.

319
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,459
We're stealing from NASA? Hell, yeah.

320
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,629
Mama's checking one more
off her bucket list.

321
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,279
Okay, we're not stealing from NASA.

322
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,499
I checked, it's impossible. I'm sorry.

323
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,169
But some of the rocks
that they brought back,

324
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:31,292
they gave out as gifts,
and they went missing.

325
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:33,739
About 180.

326
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,819
The ones they did find,

327
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,409
they found 'em in garages,

328
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:39,109
desk drawers, kids' bedrooms.
Just lying around.

329
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,427
People forgot about them,
but they're out there,

330
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,012
and I definitely think we can get one.

331
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:44,379
Okay, you guys do that.

332
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,169
I'm gonna go get some
stay-awake supplies.

333
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:48,934
I have a muffin recipe
with a special ingredient

334
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:51,186
that is guaranteed to keep
us alert for five days.

335
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,938
What is it? Meth?

336
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,429
Oh, excuse you.

337
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,984
It is a organic, locally-sourced

338
00:12:56,985 --> 00:13:00,639
natural stimulant that got me
through every finals week,

339
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,860
and it is definitely not meth.

340
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:03,299
That's exactly what I would say

341
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,860
if I was trying to get us to take meth.

342
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,369
Mm-hmm.

You're taking retirement well.

344
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,019
I find that organization

345
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,389
helps bring a sense of stability
when one's feeling...

346
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,511
not stable.

347
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,710
Okay.

348
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,999
I need to find a Book
Depository that got moved.

349
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,352
It's in Hell's Kitchen,
that's all I know.

350
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:33,429
Library buildings are
enchanted to blend in

351
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:35,669
with their new environs
whenever they're relocated.

352
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,249
You'll have to go door-to-door,

353
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,109
find the building covered
