00:00:08,934 --> 00:00:11,177
- God.
Shut up.

3
00:00:11,254 --> 00:00:13,629
- [slowly]
What's happening to you

4
00:00:13,706 --> 00:00:16,590
looks just like what
happened to my mom.

5
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:18,495
<i>The episodes didn't stop
when I was born.</i>

6
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,186
They got worse.

7
00:00:20,263 --> 00:00:21,832
- When she's alone,
everything's normal,

8
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:23,138
but when you show up...

9
00:00:23,173 --> 00:00:25,691
- I still mess her up.

10
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:27,579
<i>- The creatures
you call Takers...</i>

11
00:00:27,603 --> 00:00:29,195
<i>Do you know what they are?</i>

12
00:00:29,272 --> 00:00:31,313
<i>They are guard dogs.</i>

13
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,526
Their realm is
a security measure,

14
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,846
a barrier between your world
and the world of the Dead.

15
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,778
- The Dead will ruin Fillory.

16
00:00:37,813 --> 00:00:40,259
We must stop this,
whatever the cost.

17
00:00:40,283 --> 00:00:43,117
- Well, the cost is blowing up
the entire planet, which is...

18
00:00:43,152 --> 00:00:44,279
- A decent option.

19
00:00:44,303 --> 00:00:46,357
<i>- In the center of Fillory
is a clockwork heart</i>

20
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:47,381
<i>built by dwarves.</i>

21
00:00:47,456 --> 00:00:49,526
<i>- If I wound the clock
backward, it would...</i>

22
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,677
It would destroy Fillory.

23
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:53,530
- What about the World Seed,
from Q's page?

24
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:56,222
If we could find it, we could
use it to build a new world...

25
00:00:56,299 --> 00:00:57,368
A new Fillory.

26
00:00:57,392 --> 00:00:59,185
- I intended to rescue my people

27
00:00:59,209 --> 00:01:00,559
from this chaotic place,

28
00:01:00,636 --> 00:01:02,873
so I also built an ark.

29
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:03,874
- How do they feel?

30
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:04,966
- Like ghost fingers.

31
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:08,350
They work, but magically
they still feel severed.

32
00:01:08,427 --> 00:01:09,471
<i>- The Couple just got
the last thing they need.</i>

33
00:01:09,495 --> 00:01:11,698
<i>They have the Seed,
the Page, and the Panel.</i>

34
00:01:11,722 --> 00:01:12,479
<i>We got to tell the others.</i>

35
00:01:12,514 --> 00:01:14,701
They need to steal
that seed now.

36
00:01:14,725 --> 00:01:16,553
- Guys, Alice has an exit.

37
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:17,646
<i>Get to the roof.</i>

38
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,580

00:01:33,428 --> 00:01:36,407
- Ooh, did I sleep
till December?

42
00:01:36,431 --> 00:01:38,431
- I couldn't resist giving out
a few more gifts

43
00:01:38,507 --> 00:01:39,598
while I'm here.

44
00:01:39,675 --> 00:01:42,435
Given your quest-heavy
lifestyle,

45
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:43,897
there's no guarantee
that any of you

46
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:45,554
will live to see Christmas.

47
00:01:45,631 --> 00:01:46,939
Sit.
Have a cookie.

50
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:55,426
- No idea.
It's for Eliot.

51
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,691
- Is that a Microplane for Josh?

52
00:01:57,768 --> 00:01:59,285
He already has six.

53
00:01:59,362 --> 00:02:00,955
- Do you question
how you bend light?

54
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:03,906
Well, I don't question
how I pick gifts.

55

Here, put your finger
right here, please.

56
00:02:10,373 --> 00:02:12,039
Looking for yours?

57
00:02:12,116 --> 00:02:13,610
You already got it.

58
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,801

- What, you... you gave me that?

62
00:02:24,753 --> 00:02:27,646
- So what did the page
turn out to say?

63
00:02:27,723 --> 00:02:30,983
- It was... was a spell.
It...

64
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,936
grew a seed into a world,
but why did you put it there?

65
00:02:34,012 --> 00:02:35,299
What if I'd ignored it or...

66
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:37,784
- But you didn't.
You needed something-

67
00:02:37,808 --> 00:02:38,993
get back in the game.

68
00:02:39,017 --> 00:02:40,637
You weren't gonna pass

I'm very sorry for your loss.

71

73
00:02:54,917 --> 00:02:56,728
That page and wherever
that quest took you,

74
00:02:56,752 --> 00:02:58,419
wasn't his story.

75
00:02:58,495 --> 00:02:59,748
It was yours, Alice.

There is no uncrucial

As per several
super-chatty bunnies

114
00:04:29,512 --> 00:04:30,605
from our super buddy Rafe,

115
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:32,029
the Dark King

116
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:34,440
a portal
to the Underworld tonight.

117
00:04:34,517 --> 00:04:36,850
Now, here's the plan.

118
00:04:36,927 --> 00:04:39,612
Part the first...

119
00:04:39,688 --> 00:04:42,564
Rapture Fillory.
Margo and I will go to Fillory.

120
00:04:42,641 --> 00:04:44,066
Activate Umber's Ark.

121
00:04:44,142 --> 00:04:45,596
And then we go
to the Clockwork Heart.

122
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,362
- How will you know
they're all raptured?

123
00:04:48,438 --> 00:04:49,905
Everyone?

124
00:04:49,982 --> 00:04:52,741
- Wait, um, I know a thingy.

125
00:04:52,818 --> 00:04:54,460
It's in the castle,

126
00:04:54,537 --> 00:04:56,089
so if we just go there
and grab it...

127
00:04:56,113 --> 00:04:57,037
- Great.
Moving on.

128
00:04:57,114 --> 00:04:58,705
We will turn back the clock,

129
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,800
and then we get ready
to say good-bye to Fillory.

130
00:05:01,877 --> 00:05:04,114
- W-with you still on it?

131
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:06,755
- Obviously not.
We need to GTFO.

132
00:05:06,832 --> 00:05:08,715
- You need a traveler.

133
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,716

134
00:05:09,751 --> 00:05:12,478

00:05:12,555 --> 00:05:14,480
Gavin's still in the hospital.

00:05:14,557 --> 00:05:17,483
Oh, Peach,
or whatever your name is.

137
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,228
- Unfortunately, when I travel,
it's kind of through time.

138
00:05:21,305 --> 00:05:22,799
- And puts you in the crosshairs

139
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,156

140
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:26,492
- Meanwhile, on Earth,

141
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:28,735
Team WorldSeed...

142
00:05:28,812 --> 00:05:32,643
Alice, Fen, Zelda,
you will retrieve the Seed

143
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:36,076
from its special container
and... bloom it.

144
00:05:36,153 --> 00:05:39,483
- Where?
- It's in my vagina.

145
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:40,484
- Uh, great.

146
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:43,175
I mean, circumstances are wacky.

147
00:05:43,252 --> 00:05:45,179
Won't that make it tough to...
- Neitherlands.

148
00:05:45,203 --> 00:05:45,952
More stable there.

149
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,514
- Wouldn't Fillory
be better, since...

150
00:05:48,591 --> 00:05:49,515
- Not at all.

151
00:05:49,592 --> 00:05:52,851
In fact, counterproductive,
given imploding.

152
00:05:52,928 --> 00:05:54,239
- Okay, Peach,
I get you're nervous,

153
00:05:54,263 --> 00:05:55,999
but this isn't
our first donkey show,

154
00:05:56,023 --> 00:06:00,693
which leads me to something
actually crucial to the plan.

155
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:02,861
No presh, but...

156
00:06:02,938 --> 00:06:06,009
New Fillory better
have a wellspring.

158
00:06:08,611 --> 00:06:10,944
Or we permanently lose magic.

159
00:06:11,021 --> 00:06:14,039
- The spell says we can make
the Seed anything,

160
00:06:14,116 --> 00:06:15,616
so it should be doable.

161
00:06:15,692 --> 00:06:17,710

00:06:17,786 --> 00:06:19,453
questions, anyone?

163
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:21,788
- No?
And break.

169
00:06:29,247 --> 00:06:30,867

Just calm down.

- Eliot, go.

538
00:21:30,606 --> 00:21:32,865
- Do you not get that
I don't want you to die?

539
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,701
You're not evil.
You're just...

540
00:21:35,736 --> 00:21:37,462
You're just
some deluded asshole...

541
00:21:37,539 --> 00:21:39,038
- [chuckles]

542
00:21:39,115 --> 00:21:41,049
- That I care about.

543
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:45,637
- Who says I'll die?

544
00:21:53,087 --> 00:21:55,625
- Your daughter is healthy.
- Good.

545
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:58,057
- And Julia?

546
00:21:58,092 --> 00:22:00,487
- Has not regained
consciousness.

547
00:22:00,511 --> 00:22:01,964
- When do you expect?

548
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:03,966
- Her organs are shutting down.

549
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,550
We are trying everything, but...

550
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:10,806
- Can I see her?
- Yeah.

551
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,665
Hold tight.
- Okay.

552
00:22:19,322 --> 00:22:21,091
- Hey.
I got you some food.

553
00:22:21,115 --> 00:22:22,582
You should really eat...

554
00:22:22,617 --> 00:22:23,819
- I know I told you
you shouldn't do it.

555
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,752
But... but I will protect you,
okay, somehow.

556
00:22:26,787 --> 00:22:27,753
I know a way to get
to Jane Chatwin.

557
00:22:27,788 --> 00:22:29,266
She'll help us, and you can
go back to before...

558
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,417
- Professor...

559
00:22:30,441 --> 00:22:33,496
- You can go back and stop
Julie from dying, please.

560
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,927
- We can't.

561
00:22:34,962 --> 00:22:37,930
- Why the fuck not?

562
00:22:37,965 --> 00:22:40,525
- Because we already did.

563
00:22:40,602 --> 00:22:43,236

564
00:22:47,883 --> 00:22:48,952

565
00:22:48,976 --> 00:22:51,514
- What... what... what do
you mean "we already did"?

566
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:54,989
- This is the do-over.

567
00:22:55,066 --> 00:22:59,160
It got so much worse,
so fast before...

568
00:22:59,236 --> 00:23:01,691
So you took me
to my grandmother, Jane.

569
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:02,715
- Time loop...

570
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,830
Only way to undo time
without getting

571
00:23:04,867 --> 00:23:07,627
that grouchy time traveler's
knickers in a knot.

572
00:23:07,662 --> 00:23:09,596
[sighs]
Clean start.

573
00:23:11,332 --> 00:23:13,035
Big magic, though.

574
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:14,645
<i>- Unfortunately, she told me</i>

575
00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:17,637
<i>that I only had enough plasma
to do it once.</i>

576
00:23:17,672 --> 00:23:19,639
- Okay, but what...
What did you change?

577
00:23:19,674 --> 00:23:22,808
- Only Josh had escaped Fillory.

578
00:23:22,843 --> 00:23:24,880
In the West, they had
no way of knowing

579
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:29,023
if the Ark even worked,
so they got trapped waiting.

580
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,026
I pushed Josh to find a way.

581
00:23:32,103 --> 00:23:33,861
And the Seed,

582
00:23:33,938 --> 00:23:36,197
they tried it here and failed.

583
00:23:36,273 --> 00:23:39,125
And Zelda took them
to the Neitherlands.

584
00:23:40,328 --> 00:23:41,994
They never came back.

585
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:43,996
- Why didn't you tell them
not to do that either?

586
00:23:44,031 --> 00:23:47,208
- I tried!
They wouldn't listen!

587
00:23:47,284 --> 00:23:49,096
And Jane said
not to do too much,

588
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,907
or that might do more damage.

589
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:55,049
It's a tricky business.

590
00:23:55,126 --> 00:23:57,343
But she was adamant that I try.

591
00:23:57,378 --> 00:24:00,054
Professor, we have to tell her.

592
00:24:00,131 --> 00:24:02,181
She is trapped here

593
00:24:02,216 --> 00:24:05,726
and... insane to think
about it... pregnant

594
00:24:05,803 --> 00:24:07,320
with my mother.

595
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,074
- Yes.

596
00:24:12,727 --> 00:24:14,619
Tell me what, my dears?

597
00:24:16,814 --> 00:24:19,198
- We are going
to destroy Fillory.

598
00:24:19,233 --> 00:24:21,937
With you on it.

599
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:24,170
It is the only way
to stop your brother.

600
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:32,378
- Best we can do is
to try to stop our legacy

601
00:24:32,413 --> 00:24:34,755
from hurting anybody else.

602
00:24:34,832 --> 00:24:36,924
You're doing the right thing,
both of you.

603
00:24:37,001 --> 00:24:39,622
[sighs]

604
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:41,887
But I won't be gone.

605
00:24:41,922 --> 00:24:44,932
I'll still be here
in the Clock Barrens.

606
00:24:45,009 --> 00:24:47,727
Without Fillory,

607
00:24:47,762 --> 00:24:50,321
it'll be a little bit
harder to find me.

608
00:24:53,184 --> 00:24:54,325
- So Julia...

609
00:24:54,402 --> 00:24:57,737
- Look, I had no idea that Fogg
would suddenly attack her.

610
00:24:57,772 --> 00:24:59,238
- Fogg didn't attack last time?

611
00:24:59,273 --> 00:25:01,251
- No, I-I have no idea
why he would.

612
00:25:01,275 --> 00:25:03,284
- Wait.
Wait!

613
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,120
Fogg remembers time loops.

614
00:25:06,197 --> 00:25:09,318
What if he remembered
something and... and is...

615
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:11,676
Is trying to change this one?

616
00:25:11,753 --> 00:25:14,795
- The etheric realm shook loose
most of his screws.

617
00:25:14,872 --> 00:25:17,256
He's useless, as you can see.

618
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:19,311
But there's still
Fogg under there.

619
00:25:19,335 --> 00:25:21,686
You know, it's like
hardwood under shag.

620
00:25:21,763 --> 00:25:23,106
- Well, how do we
get rid of the shag?

621
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:25,334
- [sighs]
I'm not doing this, okay?

622
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:27,400
This is banned in 14 countries.

623
00:25:31,388 --> 00:25:33,406
[grunting]
Okay.

624
00:25:34,892 --> 00:25:36,942
The cat will hold all his crazy,

625
00:25:36,977 --> 00:25:39,014
but only while he's touching it.

626
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,850
- What happens to the cat?

627
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:43,824
- It goes, well...

628
00:25:43,901 --> 00:25:45,117
crazy.

629
00:25:45,152 --> 00:25:46,827
Don't tell PETA.

630
00:25:46,904 --> 00:25:48,713
All right.
We ready?

631
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:52,383
- [whimpering]

632
00:26:01,085 --> 00:26:04,637
Hey.
Thank you, Professor

633
00:26:04,713 --> 00:26:07,042
- The cat looks normal.

634
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,235
- [scoffs] Trust me.

635
00:26:08,259 --> 00:26:10,142
This cat's having a shit day.

636
00:26:10,177 --> 00:26:11,068
- But I managed to get everyone

637
00:26:11,145 --> 00:26:13,048
out of the Neitherlands in time.

638
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:15,981
Plum may not know, but, yes,

639
00:26:16,016 --> 00:26:17,887
they are going to be attacked.

640
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:19,871
- Well, it seems you did
manage in your way.

641
00:26:19,895 --> 00:26:20,647
- Good.

642
00:26:20,671 --> 00:26:23,989
Tell Kady the Seed
is in the lab.

643
00:26:24,024 --> 00:26:25,324
- Why did you attack Julia?

644
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:28,369
- Because she
and your child would die

645
00:26:28,445 --> 00:26:30,755
if Eleanor had performed
the goddamn surgery.

646
00:26:30,832 --> 00:26:31,975
- Yeah, well,
she's dying now, so...

647
00:26:31,999 --> 00:26:36,043
- If you had succeeded in
delicately separating the cord,

648
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,504
it would be rendered useless.

649
00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:39,839
Quick, rough cut...

650
00:26:39,874 --> 00:26:42,842
Counterintuitive, yes, I know.

651
00:26:42,877 --> 00:26:44,385
The cord goes
into a state of shock.

652
00:26:44,461 --> 00:26:45,344
- [sighs]

653
00:26:45,379 --> 00:26:47,440
Allowing it a chance
for implantation.

654
00:26:47,464 --> 00:26:49,056
- Yes.
- Shit.

655
00:26:49,133 --> 00:26:51,058
- This will let Julia recover.

656
00:26:51,135 --> 00:26:52,893
Last time
you realized far too late.

657
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:54,353
The only catch is

658
00:26:54,388 --> 00:26:55,925
you need to attach it
to someone else,

659
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:58,524
someone who can handle
the physic input from, well...

660
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,495
a clearly very powerful
traveler baby.

661
00:27:06,984 --> 00:27:10,253
- It looks still alive...
for now.

662
00:27:11,539 --> 00:27:14,039
- The Circumstances
control panel is gone,

663
00:27:14,074 --> 00:27:16,542
and the Moon
is not gonna make this easy.

664
00:27:16,577 --> 00:27:19,097
- So choice is, do it here
where the casting's jacked

665
00:27:19,121 --> 00:27:19,971
or let it die?

666
00:27:20,047 --> 00:27:23,090
If we do it here,
who knows what it'll make?

667
00:27:23,167 --> 00:27:25,562
- I think the people of Fillory
deserve a place to go,

668
00:27:25,586 --> 00:27:27,928
even if it doesn't end up
as Fillory.

669
00:27:28,005 --> 00:27:29,555
- Okay.
I'll get started.

670
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,293
- What about Eliot, Margo,
and Josh?

671
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:32,903
We still haven't heard
from them.

672
00:27:32,927 --> 00:27:34,037
Do you think
they've been able to...

673
00:27:34,061 --> 00:27:37,563
- Let's just hope they're
having more luck than we are.

674
00:27:37,598 --> 00:27:40,825
<i>- The slide to the Clock Dwarf
is at the end of the hall.</i>

675
00:27:40,902 --> 00:27:42,996
It takes ten minutes
just to slide down

676
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,080
and even longer to get back up.

677
00:27:44,104 --> 00:27:46,447
- Sorry, I was really stoned
the last time I did this.

678
00:27:46,523 --> 00:27:47,918
Time to discuss
your shortcut, Margo.

679
00:27:47,942 --> 00:27:49,742
- Yeah.
There isn't one.

680
00:27:51,245 --> 00:27:53,120
What do you want me to say?

681
00:27:53,197 --> 00:27:55,008
Somebody had to egg up
and do this,

682
00:27:55,032 --> 00:27:56,059
and I am Margo the Destroyer.

683
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:57,928
- I didn't name you that
just so you...

684
00:27:57,952 --> 00:27:59,012
- Get destroyed
while destroying?

685
00:27:59,036 --> 00:28:02,087
Both: Yeah.
- I'm not wild about it either.

686
00:28:02,122 --> 00:28:05,494
But... this thing's got to
get done, so...

687
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:07,187
- We'll all go.
- Yes, we'll all go.

688
00:28:07,211 --> 00:28:08,211
- Stop.

689
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:11,166
You know, if I learned
one thing from Quentin...

690
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,265
one...

691
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:17,194
it's that sometimes you
sacrifice for those you love.

692
00:28:17,271 --> 00:28:19,980
I'm doing this
so you two can live,

693
00:28:20,057 --> 00:28:21,908
so don't you dare follow me.

694
00:28:26,063 --> 00:28:29,114
- In case the Clock Dwarf
wasn't raptured, a bribe,

695
00:28:29,149 --> 00:28:30,324
- A ham sandwich?

696
00:28:30,401 --> 00:28:31,149
- A ham sandwich.

697
00:28:31,227 --> 00:28:34,189
That is culatello,
capicola, speck,

698
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:35,153
a bit of Jamón Ibérico,

699
00:28:35,231 --> 00:28:37,133
shaved black truffle
from the Microplane.

700
00:28:37,157 --> 00:28:40,000
