1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,946
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:08,947 --> 00:00:11,114
God. Shut up.

3
00:00:11,115 --> 00:00:13,599
What's happening to you

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,569
looks just like what happened to my mom.

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,581
The episodes didn't
stop when I was born.

6
00:00:18,582 --> 00:00:20,139
They got worse.

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,907
When she's alone, everything's normal,

8
00:00:21,908 --> 00:00:23,043
but when you show up...

9
00:00:23,044 --> 00:00:25,699
I still mess her up.

10
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,579
The creatures you call Takers...

11
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,092
do you know what they are?

12
00:00:29,093 --> 00:00:31,200
They are guard dogs.

13
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:32,839
Their realm is a security measure,

14
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,910
a barrier between your world
and the world of the Dead.

15
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:37,802
The Dead will ruin Fillory.

16
00:00:37,803 --> 00:00:40,245
We must stop this, whatever the cost.

17
00:00:40,246 --> 00:00:43,230
Well, the cost is blowing
up the entire planet,

18
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:44,356
- which is...
- A decent option.

19
00:00:44,357 --> 00:00:46,469
In the center of Fillory
is a clockwork heart

20
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:47,619
built by dwarves.

21
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,480
If I wound the clock
backward, it would...

22
00:00:49,487 --> 00:00:50,988
it would destroy Fillory.

23
00:00:50,989 --> 00:00:53,574
What about the World
Seed, from Q's page?

24
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:56,159
If we could find it, we could
use it to build a new world...

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,286
a new Fillory.

26
00:00:57,287 --> 00:00:59,079
I intended to rescue my people

27
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,581
from this chaotic place,

28
00:01:00,582 --> 00:01:02,916
so I also built an ark.

29
00:01:02,917 --> 00:01:04,793
- How do they feel?
- Like ghost fingers.

30
00:01:04,794 --> 00:01:08,255
They work, but magically
they still feel severed.

31
00:01:08,256 --> 00:01:09,673
The Couple just got
the last thing they need.

32
00:01:09,674 --> 00:01:11,705
They have the Seed,
the Page, and the Panel.

33
00:01:11,706 --> 00:01:12,718
We got to tell the others.

34
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:14,637
They need to steal that seed now.

35
00:01:14,638 --> 00:01:16,513
Guys, Alice has an exit.

36
00:01:16,514 --> 00:01:17,679
Get to the roof.

37
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,300
Ho, ho, ho, motherfuckers.

38
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,219
Oh, hey, Alice.

39
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,325
Ooh, did I sleep till December?

40
00:01:36,326 --> 00:01:38,469
I couldn't resist giving
out a few more gifts

41
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,569
while I'm here.

42
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,439
Given your quest-heavy lifestyle,

43
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,917
there's no guarantee that any of you

44
00:01:43,918 --> 00:01:45,557
will live to see Christmas.

45
00:01:45,558 --> 00:01:46,878
Sit. Have a cookie.

46
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,089
What is that?

47
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,344
No idea. It's for Eliot.

48
00:01:55,345 --> 00:01:57,739
Is that a Microplane for Josh?

49
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,119
He already has six.

50
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,927
Do you question how you bend light?

51
00:02:00,928 --> 00:02:03,927
Well, I don't question how I pick gifts.

52
00:02:03,928 --> 00:02:06,189
Here, put your finger
right here, please.

53
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,110
Looking for yours?

54
00:02:12,111 --> 00:02:13,647
You already got it.

55
00:02:13,648 --> 00:02:15,895
- Huh?
- Long time back.

56
00:02:18,218 --> 00:02:21,495
I put it in a locked drawer
in Quentin's desk.

57
00:02:21,496 --> 00:02:24,879
What, you... you gave me that?

58
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,419
So what did the page turn out to say?

59
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,069
It was... was a spell. It...

60
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,939
grew a seed into a world,
but why did you put it there?

61
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,039
- What if I'd ignored it or...
- But you didn't.

62
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,787
You needed something,

63
00:02:37,788 --> 00:02:38,959
get back in the game.

64
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,249
You weren't gonna pass on a mystery

65
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,578
you thought your guy was working on.

66
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,019
I'm very sorry for your loss.

67
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,775
It really sucks.

68
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,930
Well, now you know.

69
00:02:54,936 --> 00:02:56,799
That page and wherever
that quest took you,

70
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,069
wasn't his story.

71
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,059
It was yours, Alice.

72
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:03,299
For what it's worth, I think
he'd be really proud of you...

73
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,830
the way you keep on fighting.

74
00:03:05,946 --> 00:03:10,043
I told you... I told you you were good.

75
00:03:12,746 --> 00:03:15,117
I still don't know if that's true.

76
00:03:15,118 --> 00:03:18,049
Hey. This is how it works.

77
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:19,553
You do your best.

78
00:03:19,554 --> 00:03:23,056
You fuck up, get hurt. People die.

79
00:03:23,057 --> 00:03:26,351
Except for the odd Microplane,

80
00:03:26,352 --> 00:03:28,859
jack shit gets wrapped up in a bow.

81
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,139
Oh...

82
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,959
you know, you're a real
ray of sunshine, Santa.

83
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,649
Ho, ho, ho.

84
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,571
Oh, shit.

85
00:03:37,572 --> 00:03:39,365
- Creatures stirring.
- Mm-hmm.

86
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,957
- What the pumpkin spice fuck?
- Huh.

87
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,279
Oh, my God.

88
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,255
These are sold out literally everywhere.

89
00:03:55,256 --> 00:03:56,259
Thanks, Santa.

90
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,640
Oh, this is wrapped really tight.

91
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,299
Santa got me a bracelet?

92
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,259
It's the exact right grade

93
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,659
- for the truffle-shaving technique...
- This is so thoughtful.

94
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,679
José Andrés showed me
the last time we hung out.

95
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,719
- What is this even for?
- Oh, oh, oh, oh.

96
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,539
A-fucking-plus. This is
handy and sort of chic.

97
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,439
Oh, it's a surprise! I love surprises.

98
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,566
Is this baby shit?

99
00:04:14,567 --> 00:04:17,277
Yep. It's baby shit.

100
00:04:17,278 --> 00:04:19,989
Fillory needs you. Now!

101
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:24,284
Achtung, miscreants.

102
00:04:24,285 --> 00:04:27,559
There is no uncrucial portion of this.

103
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,399
As per several super-chatty bunnies

104
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,519
from our super buddy Rafe,

105
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,359
the Dark King is planning
on opening a portal

106
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,336
to the Underworld tonight.

107
00:04:34,337 --> 00:04:36,899
Now, here's the plan.

108
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,039
Part the first...

109
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,469
Rapture Fillory. Margo
and I will go to Fillory.

110
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,089
Activate Umber's Ark.

111
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,568
And then we go to the Clockwork Heart.

112
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:48,359
How will you know they're all raptured?

113
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,379
Everyone?

114
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,679
Wait, um, I know a thingy.

115
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,349
It's in the castle,

116
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,316
so if we just go there and grab it...

117
00:04:56,317 --> 00:04:58,610
Great. Moving on.
We will turn back the clock,

118
00:04:58,611 --> 00:05:01,895
and then we get ready to
say good-bye to Fillory.

119
00:05:01,896 --> 00:05:04,185
W-with you still on it?

120
00:05:04,186 --> 00:05:06,699
Obviously not. We need to GTFO.

121
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,699
You need a traveler.

122
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,979
23 can't aim.

123
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,410
His pervo buddy Hyman's
not speaking to us,

124
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:14,418
Gavin's still in the hospital.

125
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:17,479
Oh, Peach, or whatever your name is.

126
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,299
Unfortunately, when I travel,
it's kind of through time.

127
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,539
And puts you in the crosshairs

128
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,219
of a time psycho, so, no.

129
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,429
Meanwhile, on Earth,

130
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,299
Team WorldSeed...

131
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,657
Alice, Fen, Zelda,
you will retrieve the Seed

132
00:05:32,658 --> 00:05:36,106
from its special container
and... bloom it.

133
00:05:36,107 --> 00:05:39,519
- Where?
- It's in my vagina.

134
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,779
Uh, great.

135
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,199
I mean, circumstances are wacky.

136
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,239
- Won't that make it tough to...
- Neitherlands.

137
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,249
More stable there.

138
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,540
Wouldn't Fillory be better, since...

139
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:49,599
Not at all.

140
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,479
In fact, counterproductive,
given imploding.

141
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,294
Okay, Peach, I get you're nervous,

142
00:05:54,296 --> 00:05:56,001
but this isn't our first donkey show,

143
00:05:56,002 --> 00:06:00,699
which leads me to something
actually crucial to the plan.

144
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,779
No presh, but...

145
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,009
New Fillory better have a wellspring.

146
00:06:08,626 --> 00:06:11,005
Or we permanently lose magic.

147
00:06:11,006 --> 00:06:14,127
The spell says we can
make the Seed anything,

148
00:06:14,128 --> 00:06:15,520
so it should be doable.

149
00:06:15,521 --> 00:06:17,689
Great. Now...

150
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,507
questions, anyone?

151
00:06:19,508 --> 00:06:21,776
No? And break.

152
00:06:22,987 --> 00:06:24,738
- Was I funny?
- No.

153
00:06:24,739 --> 00:06:26,159
My water just broke.

154
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,680
- Whoa!
- Oh!

155
00:06:27,686 --> 00:06:29,339
- Ooh, okay.
- Go time!

156
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,820
Okay. Just calm down.

157
00:06:30,828 --> 00:06:32,455
- Are you okay?
- Go, let's go.

158
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,370
- Synced & corrected by<font color="#E83286"> MementMori </font>-
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.addic7ed.com</font> --

159
00:06:44,675 --> 00:06:47,039
Ready as we can be. ETA?

160
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,460
Julia should be here in under five.

161
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,707
Help! I need help!

162
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,658
What the hell happened to him?

163
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:54,840
The etheric realm.

164
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,097
A lot of it.

165
00:06:56,098 --> 00:06:57,646
This is our Fogg? You're sure?

166
00:06:57,647 --> 00:06:58,879
- Yeah.
- Okay.

167
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,119
When we sent Psycho Fogg to the realm,

168
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,800
it spit ours back out.

169
00:07:01,806 --> 00:07:04,692
He called me. He couldn't really talk.

170
00:07:04,693 --> 00:07:06,557
Okay, Henry?

171
00:07:06,558 --> 00:07:09,017
Are you in there?

172
00:07:09,018 --> 00:07:10,449
Hey. We're here!

173
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,449
Push fluids, cast Adler's Sedation.

174
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,459
Henry, be with you soon.

175
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,235
With me. Showtime.

176
00:07:15,236 --> 00:07:16,498
No!

177
00:07:16,499 --> 00:07:18,729
Hard pass, as the kids say.

178
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,519
Nyet! Indian yes.

179
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,359
Oh, hell, no.

180
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,640
Anyway, I'm not speaking to you.

181
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,540
Just wait. Do you not understand?

182
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,716
Do you not understand?

183
00:07:26,717 --> 00:07:31,304
You're asking me to travel
as a world explodes?

184
00:07:31,305 --> 00:07:33,765
Can you promise me

185
00:07:33,766 --> 00:07:36,768
no debris will hit me on my head?

186
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:38,812
- Well, no, but...
- Things on my head hurt!

187
00:07:38,813 --> 00:07:41,022
Life is pain. Ovary up.

188
00:07:41,023 --> 00:07:42,029
I am not a hero.

189
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,997
I am a man tethered to a machine

190
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,820
for poop and humiliation,

191
00:07:46,821 --> 00:07:49,185
and I abhor it.

192
00:07:49,186 --> 00:07:50,323
I said good day.

193
00:07:50,324 --> 00:07:52,297
- I have an idea.
- Oh.

194
00:07:52,298 --> 00:07:54,703
Hi. How was your nap?

195
00:07:54,704 --> 00:07:56,579
Refreshing. You need him to travel?

196
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,349
Yeah.

197
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,834
What?

198
00:08:00,906 --> 00:08:02,169
- He would never.
- Yes, he would.

199
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:03,212
- No way.
- Absolutely.

200
00:08:03,213 --> 00:08:04,799
Hey.

201
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,259
- Hyman?
- Can't squawk.

202
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,950
Getting blistered.

203
00:08:07,956 --> 00:08:09,165
Listen.

204
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:11,715
I have a man in my head.

205
00:08:12,763 --> 00:08:14,459
He's looking for a body.

206
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,739
And you have one that...

207
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,914
You don't even really want.

208
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,062
Jesus. No way he goes for this.

209
00:08:21,063 --> 00:08:24,055
You're an idiot, Charlton.

210
00:08:24,056 --> 00:08:27,095
He wants to take this?

211
00:08:27,096 --> 00:08:30,699
And I would... what?

212
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,579
Stay in the Astral forever?

213
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,117
Well, you could, or you could...

214
00:08:34,118 --> 00:08:36,597
Emphatically yes!

215
00:08:36,598 --> 00:08:39,914
- Oh, my God! On one condition.
- Okay.

216
00:08:39,915 --> 00:08:42,485
Your head pal

217
00:08:42,486 --> 00:08:45,587
has to do weird things with my body.

218
00:08:45,588 --> 00:08:49,459
S... sex things.

219
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,379
- Okay.
- What's his name?

220
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,969
Charlton.

221
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:56,339
No act too depraved, Charlton.

222
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,880
I'll be watching...

223
00:08:59,894 --> 00:09:02,687
whether you like it or not.

224
00:09:02,688 --> 00:09:04,265
What have we done?

225
00:09:04,266 --> 00:09:06,279
I'm prepped to sever
the energetic umbilical

226
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,540
once baby's here, but, um...

227
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,779
- well, I've never done it.
- What?

228
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,819
It's a unicorn baby. It's your kid.

229
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,185
It is what it is.

230
00:09:15,186 --> 00:09:16,284
Anyway, listen.

231
00:09:16,285 --> 00:09:18,847
You want drugs, girl? Say it now.

232
00:09:21,316 --> 00:09:24,539
Unicorn baby time. Let's do this.

233
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,089
It's okay. It's okay.

234
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:30,674
Eliot, Hyman, Charlton, wake up.

235
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,472
Did it work?

236
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:47,269
Oh, gods.

237
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,229
I'm tall.

238
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,015
Great. Let's test that traveling out.

239
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,297
This is the best episode ever.

240
00:10:03,066 --> 00:10:05,625
Just relax, okay? Breathe.

241
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,421
Why can't I do this?

242
00:10:10,422 --> 00:10:12,859
- Just give it a minute.
- We don't have a minute.

243
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,037
We have a world to destroy/save.

244
00:10:14,038 --> 00:10:16,019
- He just got in that body!
- He can't travel!

245
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,585
- I want to help.
- We'll be okay.

246
00:10:17,586 --> 00:10:19,175
- Will we?
- Yes.

247
00:10:19,176 --> 00:10:20,640
I know a shortcut to the portal tree.

248
00:10:20,641 --> 00:10:21,917
We just got to run.

249
00:10:21,918 --> 00:10:23,429
What, shortcut?

250
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,819
Yeah, you never mentioned that before...

251
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,896
I wanted one shortcut just for me.

252
00:10:26,897 --> 00:10:28,217
Let's go.

253
00:10:28,218 --> 00:10:30,055
Thanks for trying, Charlton.

254
00:10:30,056 --> 00:10:31,443
Ándale.

255
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,197
- Hey...
- Eliot.

256
00:10:36,198 --> 00:10:37,928
Come back safe.

257
00:10:40,123 --> 00:10:41,203
Of course.

258
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,477
Dean Fogg?

259
00:10:58,721 --> 00:11:00,799
Way easier to get in than out.

260
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,599
Hmm. Like so many things in life.

261
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,267
This will keep the Seed safe...

262
00:11:04,268 --> 00:11:06,102
for a short time.

263
00:11:06,103 --> 00:11:08,547
We should begin.

264
00:11:10,691 --> 00:11:12,809
Fogg? Why aren't you in bed?

265
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,799
- Henry, are you all right?
- Fogg?

266
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,155
Henry, what are you doing?

267
00:11:18,157 --> 00:11:20,868
Wait here. I'll get him.

268
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:37,659
You're my last messenger.
Listen carefully.

269
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,500
Tell High King Margo to...

270
00:11:40,506 --> 00:11:42,175
Hurry!

271
00:11:42,176 --> 00:11:44,449
We're goddamn trying! Thanks!

272
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,709
Got it.

273
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:52,139
- What's this now?
- A royal census scroll.

274
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,184
Oh.

275
00:11:53,185 --> 00:11:54,409
You see?

276
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,079
Two people just died,

277
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,738
and a fairy was born.

278
00:11:58,739 --> 00:12:01,115
Hatched. So we can see when
they're being raptured.

279
00:12:01,116 --> 00:12:02,719
I love it when a good lay

280
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,469
turns out to have a
working brain, don't you?

281
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,121
Yeah. That Josh is a keeper.

282
00:12:06,122 --> 00:12:10,139
Well, there's a button under here.

283
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,378
It begins!

284
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:14,922
Hey, I think it's working.

285
00:12:18,466 --> 00:12:21,119
Great, but go faster.

286
00:12:28,143 --> 00:12:29,715
I think it's picking up speed

287
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:31,337
now that all the squirrels are in.

288
00:12:31,338 --> 00:12:33,467
Hey, El, you think we should...

289
00:12:36,418 --> 00:12:39,028
Raptured? He's not Fillorian.

290
00:12:40,686 --> 00:12:43,109
You okay?

291
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,819
I'm not great at that spell,
even with enhancement.

292
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,899
Don't worry. He's dead.
They're all dead. So it's time.

293
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,500
Follow me close.

294
00:12:52,528 --> 00:12:54,585
Figured you'd come to Fillory...

295
00:12:54,586 --> 00:12:59,299
what, with your translator
spying so diligently.

296
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,577
I thought I'd cut to the chase.

297
00:13:01,578 --> 00:13:03,749
And just bring you here
to the Taker Realm

298
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,629
to ask for your help.

299
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,755
Well...

300
00:13:07,756 --> 00:13:09,059
not ask.

301
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:12,187
The final door.

302
00:13:14,982 --> 00:13:17,059
It's a girl.

303
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,940
She's beautiful.

304
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,419
Not that it's about that.
I mean, she's healthy.

305
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,449
Okay, let's celebrate on
the B-side of surgery.

306
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,700
You are a warrior.

307
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,839
Is she up?

308
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,079
Is she okay? Is Lipson?

309
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,249
Yeah. She's as prepped as she can be.

310
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,599
- Okay.
- Okay.

311
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,999
- You doing okay?
- Okay, good.

312
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,399
Goggles?

313
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,039
All right. Okay.

314
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,509
Number 14 scalpel, Selenite.

315
00:13:45,706 --> 00:13:48,307
Okay, start with the baby.

316
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,060
Shouldn't hurt either of you.
Just, you know, don't move.

317
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,300
Dean Fogg? What are you doing?

318
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,979
Wait.

319
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,060
Wait, Dean. Please.

320
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:14,469
Where the hell is the Seed?

321
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,666
Julia?

322
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:17,238
- Julia?
- Is she okay?

323
00:14:17,239 --> 00:14:18,519
- Lipson!
- Jules!

324
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,169
Julia.

325
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:23,019
I know you're worried.

326
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,539
But it's all going to be okay...

327
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,844
because of you.

328
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:29,135
There is a danger, once this door opens,

329
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:30,724
more dead will come through.

330
00:14:30,725 --> 00:14:33,142
This is insane.

331
00:14:33,143 --> 00:14:35,771
Not if you seal it fast.

332
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,899
You didn't just bring
me here to help you.

333
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,026
You knew that I would try to stop you.

334
00:14:42,027 --> 00:14:43,599
And deep down...

335
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,987
I know you want that, too.

336
00:14:47,114 --> 00:14:48,389
If I wanted you to stop me,

337
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,439
I wouldn't have cast on
that door 20 minutes ago.

338
00:14:54,776 --> 00:14:55,902
Right on time.

339
00:14:55,903 --> 00:14:57,540
- Seb. Seb, don't do this.
- Rupert!

340
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,220
Rupert.

341
00:15:01,213 --> 00:15:02,505
Lance.

342
00:15:02,506 --> 00:15:04,607
Eliot, seal the door.

343
00:15:04,608 --> 00:15:08,344
My love, my stars, my heart.

344
00:15:08,345 --> 00:15:09,470
We did it.

345
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,180
Touch me.

346
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,179
I can't.

347
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,727
You can't kill me. I can't die.

348
00:15:18,558 --> 00:15:21,065
You mean it? We can...

349
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:24,068
We can... forever.

350
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,117
No!

351
00:15:31,118 --> 00:15:33,119
No.

352
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,989
Hello, big brother.

353
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:39,625
Save me, Rupert. I love you so.

354
00:15:39,626 --> 00:15:41,210
You're still so predictable.

355
00:15:41,211 --> 00:15:43,796
Your soft heart, your stubbornness,

356
00:15:43,797 --> 00:15:45,367
your stupidity.

357
00:15:45,368 --> 00:15:46,633
What did you do to him?

358
00:15:46,634 --> 00:15:48,259
Who? Lance?

359
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,919
Never even met him.

360
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,557
He must have moved on centuries ago.

361
00:16:02,357 --> 00:16:03,524
Spent some time in the Library

362
00:16:03,525 --> 00:16:06,419
with my batty old writer
friend, Cassandra,

363
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,889
reading about the lengths
you were going to

364
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:09,939
to save him.

365
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:12,284
You didn't work nearly
so hard to save me...

366
00:16:12,285 --> 00:16:14,659
from Plover.

367
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,871
Did you?

368
00:16:16,872 --> 00:16:19,525
Of course I did...

369
00:16:19,526 --> 00:16:20,833
until I couldn't.

370
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:23,753
I had to save everyone from you.

371
00:16:23,754 --> 00:16:28,919
- You chose the dark path.
- Says the Dark King.

372
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,637
Anyways, reading about
you made me realize,

373
00:16:32,638 --> 00:16:35,762
after everything you did to stop me,

374
00:16:35,763 --> 00:16:38,392
you were going to give
me everything I needed

375
00:16:38,393 --> 00:16:40,770
to have Fillory...

376
00:16:40,771 --> 00:16:42,389
forever.

377
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,199
All I needed to do

378
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,399
was make a few judicious
political promises.

379
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,567
Leave it open. More will follow.

380
00:17:00,568 --> 00:17:02,699
And of, course, I had to
make peace with the fact

381
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,039
that we would need to kill everyone.

382
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,297
But what good are the living, really?

383
00:17:07,298 --> 00:17:10,409
The world's better off with me.

384
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,556
You're the sad little addict

385
00:17:16,557 --> 00:17:18,432
that tagged along with
Julia and Quentin.

386
00:17:18,433 --> 00:17:22,520
How in the blazes are you
still alive after all this time?

387
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,904
No matter.

388
00:17:31,888 --> 00:17:33,279
So much to do!

389
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,900
Let's go.

390
00:17:36,508 --> 00:17:39,565
Onward to the land of
the living, friends.

391
00:17:39,566 --> 00:17:41,643
All the lands of the living.

392
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,834
Kady should be back by now.

393
00:17:47,835 --> 00:17:49,099
This doesn't feel right.

394
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,519
- We should leave.
- We can't.

395
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,589
I'm certain we won't be able
to cast precisely enough

396
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,779
if we...

397
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,012
What was that?

398
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,139
Kady? Is that you?

399
00:17:59,796 --> 00:18:01,351
♪ A-hunting we will go ♪

400
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,728
♪ A-hunting we will go ♪

401
00:18:03,729 --> 00:18:05,965
♪ Heigh-ho the derry-o ♪

402
00:18:05,966 --> 00:18:07,649
♪ A-hunting we will go ♪

403
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,555
I know that voice.

404
00:18:09,556 --> 00:18:11,055
It's The Beast.

405
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:13,055
No, I killed him myself!

406
00:18:13,056 --> 00:18:14,479
Then the Dead have risen.

407
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,659
Follow me.

408
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,283
Hello, friends.

409
00:18:17,284 --> 00:18:19,161
We've come to bring death everywhere.

410
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,499
This room is warded, but not for long.

411
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,533
That way... a portal will
take you to Brakebills.

412
00:18:26,534 --> 00:18:29,334
Go. Alice... when you
recover the Seed...

413
00:18:29,335 --> 00:18:31,759
I-I only have one good hand.
We need you. I can't...

414
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,995
There's something Master Magicians know.

415
00:18:33,996 --> 00:18:37,234
You can never fully control
external circumstances.

416
00:18:37,235 --> 00:18:39,348
They may even be actively hostile.

417
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,892
But you can control the ones inside you.

418
00:18:41,893 --> 00:18:44,509
And one hand...

419
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,239
is plenty.

420
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,975
I've always known you'll get there.

421
00:18:48,976 --> 00:18:50,559
But today?

422
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,140
Try. Okay?

423
00:18:53,153 --> 00:18:54,737
Just try.

424
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,117
Go now. Hurry.

425
00:19:00,488 --> 00:19:02,315
- Come with us.
- I can't.

426
00:19:02,316 --> 00:19:04,372
I'm going to have to
initiate Permafrost.

427
00:19:04,373 --> 00:19:06,359
It'll stop the Dead using the fountains

428
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,715
to get to other worlds.

429
00:19:07,716 --> 00:19:10,419
Once I initiate, every portal
will close within minutes.

430
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,129
We can't just leave you here.

431
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:16,109
For a librarian, death isn't the end.

432
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:19,320
It is merely a transfer
to another branch.

433
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,597
Go.

434
00:19:23,767 --> 00:19:27,349
Wait, Zelda.

435
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:30,356
Thank you... for everything.

436
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:44,799
Hello, noble Librarian.

437
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,996
Did you just...

438
00:19:45,997 --> 00:19:47,239
Mm.

439
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,879
We have to run...

440
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,710
before the sodding fountain
to Fillory's locked.

441
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:55,716
I'll find another way.

442
00:19:56,576 --> 00:19:58,369
Not that you'll be here to see it.

443
00:20:06,226 --> 00:20:08,079
So lovely.

444
00:20:13,058 --> 00:20:15,499
Eliot, stop! Eliot, wait!

445
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,279
You took your shot.
You destroyed the entire world.

446
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,939
Will you just leave it...

447
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,159
Please... please, let me just
at least heal your hand.

448
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,779
Shh.

449
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:31,199
I survived war, losing Lance,

450
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,109
my family torn apart by a monster

451
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:34,339
who said he would take
care of my brother,

452
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,499
and I thought one thing...

453
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,285
I just want to use magic
for one thing I want...

454
00:20:39,286 --> 00:20:42,219
- You knew better.
- I had to try!

455
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,181
You couldn't understand that.

456
00:20:45,643 --> 00:20:48,977
But I do understand. I always did.

457
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:53,273
Eliot, what was the plan?

458
00:20:53,274 --> 00:20:55,260
Before I, uh...

459
00:20:57,726 --> 00:20:58,892
My friends are here.

460
00:20:58,893 --> 00:21:01,269
They're rapturing everyone so
we can destroy this planet

461
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,657
that we love, by the way.

462
00:21:02,658 --> 00:21:04,951
But we have to to destroy you.

463
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:08,759
You left us no choice, Seb.

464
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,789
That could still work.

465
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,167
I could cut off the door
to the Underworld,

466
00:21:11,168 --> 00:21:13,115
stop Martin bringing
anymore Dead through.

467
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,253
Don't try to cast. You'll hurt yourself.

468
00:21:18,254 --> 00:21:20,748
Great, not like the zombies are coming.

469
00:21:20,749 --> 00:21:22,919
Go. Find your friends.

470
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,379
I can hold off the Dead.
It's not like they can kill me.

471
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,539
No, they can rip you to shreds,

472
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,558
and then we'd kill you anyway.

473
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,429
Eliot, go.

474
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,760
Do you not get that I
don't want you to die?

475
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:35,692
You're not evil. You're just...

476
00:21:35,693 --> 00:21:38,527
You're just some deluded asshole...

477
00:21:38,528 --> 00:21:41,049
That I care about.

478
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:46,140
Who says I'll die?

479
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,579
- Your daughter is healthy.
- Good.

480
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,879
And Julia?

481
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,381
Has not regained consciousness.

482
00:22:00,438 --> 00:22:01,757
When do you expect?

483
00:22:01,758 --> 00:22:04,029
Her organs are shutting down.

484
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,554
We are trying everything, but...

485
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,389
- Can I see her?
- Yeah.

486
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:13,520
- Hold tight.
- Okay.

487
00:22:19,322 --> 00:22:21,139
Hey. I got you some food.

488
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,600
You should really eat...

489
00:22:22,604 --> 00:22:23,822
I know I told you you shouldn't do it.

490
00:22:23,823 --> 00:22:26,699
But... but I will protect
you, okay, somehow.

491
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,229
I know a way to get to Jane Chatwin.

492
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,579
She'll help us, and you
can go back to before...

493
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,619
- Professor...
- You can go back

494
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,706
and stop Julie from dying, please.

495
00:22:32,707 --> 00:22:34,869
We can't.

496
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,160
Why the fuck not?

497
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:40,421
Because we already did.

498
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:51,433
What... what... what do
you mean "we already did"?

499
00:22:51,434 --> 00:22:54,599
This is the do-over.

500
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,220
It got so much worse, so fast before...

501
00:22:59,218 --> 00:23:01,651
So you took me to my grandmother, Jane.

502
00:23:01,652 --> 00:23:02,979
Time loop...

503
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,769
only way to undo time without getting

504
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:07,559
that grouchy time traveler's
knickers in a knot.

505
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,409
Clean start.

506
00:23:11,332 --> 00:23:13,069
Big magic, though.

507
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,739
Unfortunately, she told me

508
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,739
that I only had enough
plasma to do it once.

509
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,662
Okay, but what... what did you change?

510
00:23:19,663 --> 00:23:22,713
Only Josh had escaped Fillory.

511
00:23:22,714 --> 00:23:24,955
In the West, they had no way of knowing

512
00:23:24,956 --> 00:23:29,011
if the Ark even worked,
so they got trapped waiting.

513
00:23:29,012 --> 00:23:32,056
I pushed Josh to find a way.

514
00:23:32,057 --> 00:23:33,917
And the Seed,

515
00:23:33,918 --> 00:23:36,259
they tried it here and failed.

516
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,125
And Zelda took them to the Neitherlands.

517
00:23:40,361 --> 00:23:41,983
They never came back.

518
00:23:41,984 --> 00:23:43,985
Why didn't you tell them
not to do that either?

519
00:23:43,986 --> 00:23:45,689
I tried!

520
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,359
They wouldn't listen!

521
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,106
And Jane said not to do too much,

522
00:23:49,107 --> 00:23:51,359
or that might do more damage.

523
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,075
It's a tricky business.

524
00:23:55,076 --> 00:23:57,414
But she was adamant that I try.

525
00:23:57,415 --> 00:24:00,084
Professor, we have to tell her.

526
00:24:00,085 --> 00:24:02,169
She is trapped here

527
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:05,559
and... insane to think
about it... pregnant

528
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,716
with my mother.

529
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,070
Yes.

530
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,390
Tell me what, my dears?

531
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,379
We are going to destroy Fillory.

532
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,950
With you on it.

533
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:24,109
It is the only way to stop your brother.

534
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:32,399
Best we can do is to
try to stop our legacy

535
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,952
from hurting anybody else.

536
00:24:33,953 --> 00:24:36,912
You're doing the right
thing, both of you.

537
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,750
But I won't be gone.

538
00:24:41,874 --> 00:24:44,920
I'll still be here in the Clock Barrens.

539
00:24:44,921 --> 00:24:47,549
Without Fillory,

540
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:50,301
it'll be a little bit harder to find me.

541
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,560
So Julia...

542
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:57,599
Look, I had no idea that Fogg
would suddenly attack her.

543
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,339
Fogg didn't attack last time?

544
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,263
No, I-I have no idea why he would.

545
00:25:01,264 --> 00:25:03,339
Wait. Wait!

546
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:05,679
Fogg remembers time loops.

547
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:09,379
What if he remembered
something and... and is...

548
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,072
is trying to change this one?

549
00:25:11,073 --> 00:25:14,855
The etheric realm shook
loose most of his screws.

550
00:25:14,856 --> 00:25:17,315
He's useless, as you can see.

551
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:19,288
But there's still Fogg under there.

552
00:25:19,289 --> 00:25:21,623
You know, it's like hardwood under shag.

553
00:25:21,624 --> 00:25:23,084
Well, how do we get rid of the shag?

554
00:25:23,085 --> 00:25:25,589
I'm not doing this, okay?

555
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,422
This is banned in 14 countries.

556
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:33,406
Okay.

557
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,930
The cat will hold all his crazy,

558
00:25:36,933 --> 00:25:39,017
but only while he's touching it.

559
00:25:39,018 --> 00:25:40,925
What happens to the cat?

560
00:25:40,926 --> 00:25:43,827
It goes, well...

561
00:25:43,828 --> 00:25:45,142
crazy.

562
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:46,774
Don't tell PETA.

563
00:25:46,775 --> 00:25:48,939
All right. We ready?

564
00:26:01,456 --> 00:26:04,689
Hey. Thank you, Professor

565
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,219
The cat looks normal.

566
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:10,089
Trust me. This cat's having a shit day.

567
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:11,176
But I managed to get everyone

568
00:26:11,178 --> 00:26:12,758
out of the Neitherlands in time.

569
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:15,919
Plum may not know, but, yes,

570
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,840
they are going to be attacked.

571
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:19,979
Well, it seems you did
manage in your way.

572
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:23,930
Good. Tell Kady the Seed is in the lab.

573
00:26:23,937 --> 00:26:25,312
Why did you attack Julia?

574
00:26:25,313 --> 00:26:28,389
Because she and your child would die

575
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,815
if Eleanor had performed
the goddamn surgery.

576
00:26:30,816 --> 00:26:32,419
Yeah, well, she's dying now, so...

577
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:35,989
If you had succeeded in
delicately separating the cord,

578
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:38,519
it would be rendered useless.

579
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,739
Quick, rough cut...

580
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,704
counterintuitive, yes, I know.

581
00:26:42,705 --> 00:26:45,433
The cord goes into a state of shock.

582
00:26:45,434 --> 00:26:47,699
Allowing it a chance for implantation.

583
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,940
- Yes.
- Shit.

584
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,859
This will let Julia recover.

585
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,798
Last time you realized far too late.

586
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,379
The only catch is

587
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,995
you need to attach it to someone else,

588
00:26:55,996 --> 00:26:58,544
someone who can handle
the physic input from, well...

589
00:26:58,545 --> 00:27:01,850
a clearly very powerful traveler baby.

590
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,150
It looks still alive... for now.

591
00:27:11,572 --> 00:27:13,989
The Circumstances control panel is gone,

592
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,697
and the Moon is not
gonna make this easy.

593
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,139
So choice is, do it here
where the casting's jacked

594
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,320
or let it die?

595
00:27:20,326 --> 00:27:23,075
If we do it here, who
knows what it'll make?

596
00:27:23,076 --> 00:27:25,542
I think the people of Fillory
deserve a place to go,

597
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:27,859
even if it doesn't end up as Fillory.

598
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,299
Okay. I'll get started.

599
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,363
What about Eliot, Margo, and Josh?

600
00:27:31,364 --> 00:27:32,799
We still haven't heard from them.

601
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,819
Do you think they've been able to...

602
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:37,634
Let's just hope they're having
more luck than we are.

603
00:27:37,635 --> 00:27:40,721
The slide to the Clock Dwarf
is at the end of the hall.

604
00:27:40,722 --> 00:27:42,899
It takes ten minutes just to slide down

605
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,974
and even longer to get back up.

606
00:27:43,975 --> 00:27:46,439
Sorry, I was really stoned
the last time I did this.

607
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,811
Time to discuss your shortcut, Margo.

608
00:27:47,812 --> 00:27:49,439
Yeah. There isn't one.

609
00:27:51,149 --> 00:27:53,439
What do you want me to say?

610
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,010
Somebody had to egg up and do this,

611
00:27:55,016 --> 00:27:56,321
and I am Margo the Destroyer.

612
00:27:56,322 --> 00:27:57,809
I didn't name you that just so you...

613
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:58,849
Get destroyed while destroying?

614
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:00,599
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

615
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,110
I'm not wild about it either.

616
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:05,579
But... this thing's got
to get done, so...

617
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,189
- We'll all go.
- Yes, we'll all go.

618
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,200
Stop.

619
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:11,237
You know, if I learned one
thing from Quentin...

620
00:28:11,238 --> 00:28:13,199
one...

621
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,174
it's that sometimes you
sacrifice for those you love.

622
00:28:17,175 --> 00:28:19,885
I'm doing this so you two can live,

623
00:28:19,886 --> 00:28:21,846
so don't you dare follow me.

624
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:29,019
In case the Clock Dwarf
wasn't raptured, a bribe.

625
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:30,619
A ham sandwich?

626
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:34,259
A ham sandwich. That is
culatello, capicola, speck,

627
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,499
a bit of Jamón Ibérico,

628
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,144
shaved black truffle
from the Microplane.

629
00:28:37,145 --> 00:28:39,899
That is the best goddamn
ham sandwich ever made.

630
00:28:56,286 --> 00:28:58,289
This way I'll know you guys are safe.

631
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:00,218
I'll wait until you get
through the tree to do it.

632
00:29:00,219 --> 00:29:01,760
Bambi, wait!

633
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,047
Come on.

634
00:29:14,954 --> 00:29:16,212
Penny?

635
00:29:17,986 --> 00:29:20,692
Hey. You're... you're, um...

636
00:29:20,693 --> 00:29:22,353
You're up. How are you...

637
00:29:22,354 --> 00:29:23,490
how are you feeling?

638
00:29:23,491 --> 00:29:27,145
Oh, decent, considering.

639
00:29:27,146 --> 00:29:28,199
Where's baby?

640
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,619
Oh, Lipson took her to get changed.

641
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,829
How come I can't hear her?

642
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:33,900
Up here?

643
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,419
You're fixed.

644
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,840
How?

645
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:41,919
Here she is, baby Eleanor.

646
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,629
I don't remember naming her Eleanor.

647
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,345
Yeah, it's 'cause we didn't.

648
00:29:45,346 --> 00:29:47,722
People name their kid after
their doctor all the time.

649
00:29:47,723 --> 00:29:49,766
- It's a thing that happens.
- Sure.

650
00:29:49,767 --> 00:29:52,219
All right, Eleanor.

651
00:30:01,418 --> 00:30:05,307
Oh, I think she, uh...
she may have just pooped.

652
00:30:05,308 --> 00:30:07,689
Oh, hey, uh, I got this.

653
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:10,229
I've been practicing.

654
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:12,020
I'm ready.

655
00:30:15,473 --> 00:30:17,669
Hope...

656
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:19,657
I like that.

657
00:30:19,658 --> 00:30:23,279
I never said that. I thought it and...

658
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,090
Yes, I can...

659
00:30:26,093 --> 00:30:28,889
live with Quentin as her middle name.

660
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:31,975
Good. Again, what the hell?

661
00:30:31,976 --> 00:30:33,762
Side effect.

662
00:30:33,763 --> 00:30:36,135
Uh, we had to attach the cord to Penny,

663
00:30:36,136 --> 00:30:38,345
and when we did, you got better.

664
00:30:38,346 --> 00:30:40,689
Wait, so you got your...
You're psychic again?

665
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:42,359
Only when I'm holding her.

666
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:45,322
What else can you do while holding her?

667
00:30:56,501 --> 00:30:58,453
Ah!

668
00:30:58,454 --> 00:31:00,232
Hello?

669
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:04,290
Hello?

670
00:31:04,293 --> 00:31:06,134
Anybody there?

671
00:31:07,538 --> 00:31:10,138
Of course not.

672
00:31:10,139 --> 00:31:14,133
"Do not turn backward,
or Fillory will be destroyed.

673
00:31:14,134 --> 00:31:15,706
Management."

674
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:19,731
Guess he got raptured.

675
00:31:19,732 --> 00:31:22,385
Okay, boys.

676
00:31:22,386 --> 00:31:24,528
Show me you were able
to make it out of here.

677
00:31:24,529 --> 00:31:25,775
Hey, Margo.

678
00:31:25,776 --> 00:31:27,813
In case you can read lips,

679
00:31:27,814 --> 00:31:30,727
I just want to say,
you're the love of my life.

680
00:31:30,728 --> 00:31:32,399
I know. Duh.

681
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,164
Anyway, um, we're here.

682
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,819
Okay, we are officially at zero,

683
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,691
which means...

684
00:31:44,845 --> 00:31:46,967
Oh, she looks very pregnant.

685
00:31:46,968 --> 00:31:48,739
Actually, the male seahorse

686
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,680
carries the young and gives birth.

687
00:31:51,681 --> 00:31:53,557
- Margo would have dug that.
- Yeah.

688
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,689
Are we really doing this?

689
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:04,537
I don't think I can do this.

690
00:32:04,538 --> 00:32:05,819
We'll do this together.

691
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:10,499
Okay.

692
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,860
Here we go, Bambi.

693
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:14,990
Bye.

694
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,725
She's not coming back.

695
00:33:28,726 --> 00:33:30,515
You don't know that.

696
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,370
What is this?

697
00:33:45,378 --> 00:33:47,709
They ended Fillory.

698
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:52,050
Well, that hardly seems sporting!

699
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:03,020
Aah!

700
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:17,310
Come with me if you want to live!

701
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,410
Penny?

702
00:34:19,412 --> 00:34:21,203
Yeah, sorry! Josh wanted me to say it!

703
00:34:21,204 --> 00:34:22,915
It seemed real important
to him! Come on!

704
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:43,999
I've never cast magic before.

705
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,679
You're not casting now, Fen.

706
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,106
Just... I'm just happy to be included.

707
00:34:47,107 --> 00:34:49,279
I feel all tingly.

708
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,537
Is that what casting magic feels like?

709
00:34:51,538 --> 00:34:54,235
- Too late to swap her out for Kady?
- Don't be mean.

710
00:34:54,236 --> 00:34:56,692
Look, I haven't spent time in Fillory.

711
00:34:56,693 --> 00:34:58,439
Unless you want your new world

712
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,076
looking like the Lower East Side?

713
00:35:00,077 --> 00:35:01,347
- Then...
- Mm.

714
00:35:01,348 --> 00:35:02,495
I could try.

715
00:35:02,496 --> 00:35:04,887
Lipson said it's too soon.

716
00:35:04,888 --> 00:35:07,418
- Permanent damage.
- I just want to help.

717
00:35:08,288 --> 00:35:10,703
The Moon is cranky.

718
00:35:10,704 --> 00:35:14,591
Zelda's gone, and Alice
is down a hand, so...

719
00:35:15,689 --> 00:35:19,879
Um, I know something that might help.

720
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,931
You cracked the code
on Moon circumstances?

721
00:35:21,932 --> 00:35:23,960
- Nope.
- Then what the hell is your plan?

722
00:35:25,796 --> 00:35:28,549
My plan is I'm going to accept

723
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,733
exactly everything I am right now.

724
00:35:30,734 --> 00:35:34,899
Instagram that nonsense
later, girl. I mean...

725
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,299
Every single good and shitty part

726
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,069
and especially the shit.

727
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:42,119
I suggest we all do it.

728
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:44,259
We have to acknowledge it

729
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,749
in order to adjust for
it in your casting.

730
00:35:48,209 --> 00:35:50,549
Internal circumstances...

731
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:52,838
it's the one thing we can control.

732
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,570
One hand is plenty.

733
00:36:01,806 --> 00:36:03,589
I'm ready.

734
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:05,643
Are you ready?

735
00:36:06,838 --> 00:36:10,102
Hold Fillory in your minds, okay?

736
00:36:10,103 --> 00:36:13,007
Too late to pee?

737
00:36:13,008 --> 00:36:14,787
You know what? It's... it's fine.

738
00:36:14,788 --> 00:36:16,939
It's fine. Sorry.

739
00:36:43,548 --> 00:36:46,009
It's ready, Fen.

740
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,140
- Do I just...
- Talk to it.

741
00:36:57,144 --> 00:36:58,653
Your memories.

742
00:36:58,654 --> 00:37:02,359
Um, okay. Okay.

743
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:06,199
Uh, I remember the... the Silver Banks

744
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,537
and Chatwin's Torrent

745
00:37:07,538 --> 00:37:11,459
and, uh... the Chankly Bore?

746
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,669
Huh, that was weird.

747
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:17,959
Uh, there's Broken Bay

748
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,577
and...

749
00:37:20,578 --> 00:37:23,384
- Nothing's happening.
- What the fuck, Fen?

750
00:37:23,385 --> 00:37:25,181
You can't just describe it.

751
00:37:25,182 --> 00:37:27,599
You need to give it your memories.

752
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,770
Oh. Okay.

753
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:34,376
My Fillory...

754
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,570
I remember...

755
00:37:40,571 --> 00:37:43,587
the first time...

756
00:37:43,588 --> 00:37:46,145
I saw a Pegasus.

757
00:37:46,146 --> 00:37:47,870
I was ten.

758
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,580
Only in Fillory.

759
00:37:51,582 --> 00:37:56,503
I remember the first time...

760
00:37:56,504 --> 00:37:58,947
I saw my dad use magic

761
00:37:58,948 --> 00:38:00,548
to make a knife.

762
00:38:00,549 --> 00:38:04,427
And then he wouldn't show
me 'cause I'm a girl.

763
00:38:04,428 --> 00:38:05,965
I remember

764
00:38:05,966 --> 00:38:08,224
my dad gave me away to a stranger.

765
00:38:08,225 --> 00:38:10,349
And that's where I realized

766
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:13,999
Fillory kind of sucks sometimes.

767
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,607
- What are you doing?
- I'm talking about my Fillory.

768
00:38:16,608 --> 00:38:20,229
That place could be,
uh, backwards as shit.

769
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:25,219
And I'm thinking I don't
want to replicate that.

770
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,243
We kind of need a wellspring, so...

771
00:38:27,244 --> 00:38:29,787
Right.

772
00:38:34,124 --> 00:38:37,767
Can't I just...

773
00:38:37,768 --> 00:38:39,838
have the best of Fillory?

774
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,967
The best of us, of Earth.

775
00:38:44,385 --> 00:38:48,179
Plus the best of those cool
movies Todd and I watched.

776
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,994
That's the home I want.

777
00:38:52,772 --> 00:38:55,520
That's what we deserve.

778
00:38:58,482 --> 00:39:00,316
It's happening. It's happening!

779
00:39:00,317 --> 00:39:01,975
Keep going! Keep going!

780
00:39:23,053 --> 00:39:24,884
- Where'd they go?
- I don't know.

781
00:39:36,186 --> 00:39:37,979
Well, how's it feel?

782
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,389
Like I'm holding a goddamn crazy cat

783
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:43,809
and the fur is ruining my custom suits.

784
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:47,652
No wonder all those Bond
villains were always so pissy.

785
00:39:47,653 --> 00:39:48,779
Bright side...

786
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,284
you can actually complain
while you're holding it.

787
00:39:50,285 --> 00:39:52,535
Ah, what a joy.

788
00:39:52,536 --> 00:39:54,412
And magic hasn't vanished.

789
00:39:54,413 --> 00:39:56,119
There's that.

790
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,708
The Moon's more wonked
than ever, of course.

791
00:39:58,709 --> 00:40:00,599
Why should anything be easy?

792
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,160
Maybe we should take a cue
from the Hedge Witches.

793
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:05,259
Safehouses are starting to keep

794
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,360
a moon-brained lunatic on retainer.

795
00:40:07,368 --> 00:40:09,469
So can we count on circumstances holding

796
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:10,819
through tonight or... ?

797
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,138
Yeah, I'd move fast, though.

798
00:40:12,139 --> 00:40:15,799
That we can do. Right, boss?

799
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,319
Speaking of adjustments,

800
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,000
how's the newest member
of our faculty holding up?

801
00:40:20,008 --> 00:40:21,147
His hands are healed.

802
00:40:21,148 --> 00:40:22,659
He just has to get used to the fact

803
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,948
that half of his friends are gone.

804
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:26,719
Charlton, in Hymanesque form.

805
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,299
Here you are in your happy place, but...

806
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,780
you don't seem happy.

807
00:40:33,646 --> 00:40:37,257
I thought being here and teaching

808
00:40:37,258 --> 00:40:40,659
would help, but...

809
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,727
it hasn't.

810
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:52,804
I...

811
00:40:52,805 --> 00:40:55,625
I miss them.

812
00:40:55,626 --> 00:40:58,383
I feel lost and alone without them...

813
00:40:58,384 --> 00:41:01,919
Margo, all of them.

814
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,319
I even miss Fillory.

815
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,967
Do you think, um...

816
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,280
There's no way Seb survived, huh?

817
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,210
Probably not.

818
00:41:13,218 --> 00:41:15,105
Fillory's gone.

819
00:41:15,106 --> 00:41:17,355
But maybe it's better now.

820
00:41:17,356 --> 00:41:21,995
Maybe now he's somewhere
with someone who loves him.

821
00:41:23,794 --> 00:41:26,115
You're not alone, you know?

822
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:27,651
Eliot.

823
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:34,739
Oh, gods.

824
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:37,557
I am still not used to
how strong alcohol is.

825
00:41:37,558 --> 00:41:40,005
Keep drinking. It'll come.

826
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,180
So I have a surprise for you.

827
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,990
I have had a lot of terrible
surprises of late, Charlton.

828
00:41:48,998 --> 00:41:53,377
I've been getting help from Pete...

829
00:41:53,378 --> 00:41:55,658
the Hedge Witch who deals
in magical objects?

830
00:41:55,659 --> 00:41:58,536
Good Lord. Why?

831
00:41:58,537 --> 00:42:01,485
He helped me figure this out.

832
00:42:01,486 --> 00:42:03,405
Santa left it for you.

833
00:42:12,342 --> 00:42:15,037
Charlton.

834
00:42:15,038 --> 00:42:18,014
You look like you.

835
00:42:18,015 --> 00:42:20,465
I also feel like me.

836
00:42:20,466 --> 00:42:24,837
If you touch me but also inside...

837
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:28,358
It's nice.

838
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,739
- Well, this is weird.
- Good weird?

839
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:46,251
- So...
- I have an awkward question.

840
00:42:46,252 --> 00:42:47,959
I often ask myself what you'd say,

841
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:48,973
and the answer's, "Of course not.

842
00:42:48,975 --> 00:42:50,881
Don't be stupid, Charlton.
Eliot's isn't the kind of... "

843
00:42:50,882 --> 00:42:51,882
Charlton.

844
00:42:51,883 --> 00:42:53,842
Ask.

845
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:57,974
I wonder whether you could
ever be romantically inclined

846
00:42:57,976 --> 00:42:59,875
with some someone like me?

847
00:42:59,876 --> 00:43:02,339
A thousand-year-old Fillorian

848
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,139
in a pervert ghost's body

849
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,812
wearing a transfiguration amulet?

850
00:43:05,813 --> 00:43:07,152
A man who knows you well,

851
00:43:07,153 --> 00:43:09,441
is emotionally available,
and plans to stick around.

852
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:21,077
Well, shit, Charlton.

853
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,739
Are we going somewhere?

854
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:27,875
Upstairs to explore this further.

855
00:43:27,876 --> 00:43:29,545
Fuck.

856
00:44:07,499 --> 00:44:11,086
And what of the efforts to
find our missing students?

857
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:17,419
- Eliot send those?
- Hey.

858
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:19,619
Where should we start?

859
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:23,460
I guess at the top.

860
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:27,699
I'm sorry there's always another quest.

861
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,438
I know you wanted to just, uh...

862
00:44:29,439 --> 00:44:30,929
Make a home.

863
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:32,690
Mm. Yeah.

864
00:44:32,691 --> 00:44:33,999
Yeah.

865
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,279
And this is a batshit way
to do it, but it is a way.

866
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,399
Plus, someone's got
to find those idiots.

867
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,480
Shit's never what we
think it's gonna be.

868
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,499
Very occasionally it's better.

869
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:50,160
Right, HQ?

870
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:51,649
Right? Yeah.

871
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:53,940
- HQ?
- Yeah.

872
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:56,130
Here, just hold my hand.

873
00:44:58,217 --> 00:45:00,218
Where do you think they are?

874
00:45:00,219 --> 00:45:02,939
Maybe they got sucked
into the World Seed

875
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:05,179
because it needed matter
to turn into a new world.

876
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:08,187
Maybe it didn't work,
and they got vaporized.

877
00:45:08,189 --> 00:45:10,675
And yet...

878
00:45:10,676 --> 00:45:12,522
we still have magic.

879
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:18,653
Somewhere a wellspring exists.

880
00:45:18,654 --> 00:45:20,696
Yeah.

881
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,080
Look what I found.

882
00:45:36,088 --> 00:45:37,797
Turns out this place has knife trees.

883
00:45:37,798 --> 00:45:39,139
I mean, if Josh could find

884
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:41,679
naturally occurring pizza
ovens, then why not?

885
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,050
Hey, guys.

886
00:45:43,053 --> 00:45:45,329
Found a Margherita here,

887
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:47,391
if anyone is hungry.

888
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:50,419
This definitely isn't Fillory.

889
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:53,099
Yeah, but it's not not Fillory.

890
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,148
Kind of smells the same, right?

891
00:45:55,149 --> 00:45:58,479
The opium made it. That's a plus.

892
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,087
I passed a field of bacon... crispy.

893
00:46:02,088 --> 00:46:05,477
- Is that a Fillory thing?
- Mm. More of a me thing.

894
00:46:05,478 --> 00:46:08,177
Well, the air is breathable,

895
00:46:08,178 --> 00:46:09,655
food galore,

896
00:46:09,656 --> 00:46:12,369
no predators in the vicinity.

897
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:13,860
Is it time?

898
00:46:14,876 --> 00:46:16,085
No?

899
00:46:16,086 --> 00:46:17,109
If we let them out,

900
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:18,879
we have to tell them we're utterly lost.

901
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,499
No idea where we are
and not a bunny in sight

902
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,384
to get a message to our friends.

903
00:46:23,385 --> 00:46:25,245
And they'll be homesick and scared

904
00:46:25,246 --> 00:46:27,357
and cranky and hungry.

905
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:31,249
We'll have to build
infrastructure from scratch.

906
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:34,339
So...

907
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:36,397
Who wants to do the honors?

908
00:46:36,398 --> 00:46:39,233
You carried the whole
world in your cooch.

909
00:46:39,234 --> 00:46:40,732
You earned it.

910
00:46:42,726 --> 00:46:44,685
Thanks for saying that.

911
00:46:44,686 --> 00:46:47,825
But New Fillory needs a leader.

912
00:46:47,826 --> 00:46:49,329
And...

913
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:51,949
as its literal birth mother...

914
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:55,499
I feel I get to say...

915
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,044
I hereby dub thee

916
00:46:58,045 --> 00:47:00,919
High King Margo, the Creator.

917
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,180
Whoo!

918
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:07,537
Fine. Make a meal out of it.

919
00:47:07,538 --> 00:47:10,222
You guys know our lives are
about to get even weirder

920
00:47:10,223 --> 00:47:12,726
in some insane way we
can't possibly predict?

921
00:47:12,727 --> 00:47:14,250
- I mean, yes.
- Yes.

922
00:47:14,270 --> 00:47:16,145
- I mean, yes.
- Yes.

923
00:47:16,146 --> 00:47:18,805
I find that somehow...

924
00:47:18,806 --> 00:47:20,399
perversely comforting.

925
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:21,800
So do I.

926
00:47:23,306 --> 00:47:26,864
That's how I know it's our story.
