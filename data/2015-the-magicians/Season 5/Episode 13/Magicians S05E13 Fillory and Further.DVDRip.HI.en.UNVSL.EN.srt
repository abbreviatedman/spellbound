00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:57,566
Spent some time in the Library

354
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,424
with my batty old
writer friend Cassandra,

355
00:16:00,493 --> 00:16:02,826
reading about the
lengths you were going to,

356
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:04,261
to save him.

357
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:09,633
You didn't work nearly so hard
to save me from Plover, did you?

358
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:10,862
(MAGIC WARBLES)

359
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,772
Of course I did,

360
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:14,969
until I couldn't.

361
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:17,305
I had to save everyone from you.

362
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,075
You chose the dark
path. (MAGIC WARBLES)

(CHUCKLES) Says the Dark King.

364
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,619
Anyways, reading about
you made me realize,

365
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:29,884
after everything
you did to stop me,

366
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,356
you were going to give
me everything I needed

367
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,656
to have Fillory forever.

368
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,267
All I needed to do (SIGHS)

369
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:45,362
was make a few
judicious political promises.

00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,710
Leave it open. More will follow.

373
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:56,692
And of course, I had to
make peace with the fact

374
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:59,015
that we would need
to kill everyone.

375
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,019
But what good are
the living, really?

376
00:17:02,054 --> 00:17:03,545
The world's better off with me.

377
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:10,529
You're the sad little addict

378
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,394
that tagged along
with Julia and Quentin.

379
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,596
How in the blazes are you
still alive after all this time?

380
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,836
No matter.

381
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,514
So much to do. Let's go.

382
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:33,710
Onward to the land
of the living, friends.

383
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:35,516
All the lands of the living.

384
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:41,250
Kady should be back by now.

385
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,522
This doesn't feel right.
We should leave. We can't.

386
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:46,436
I'm certain we won't be able to cast
precisely enough if... (DOOR BANGS)

387
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,028

394
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:02,074
I know that voice.

00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,343
It's The Beast.

396
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,249
No, I killed him myself.

397
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:08,651
Then the dead have
risen. Follow me.

398
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:12,213
THE BEAST: Hello, friends. We've
come to bring death everywhere.

399
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,427
This room is warded,
but not for long.

400
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:19,465
That way. A portal will
take you to Brakebills.

401
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,056
Go. Alice?

402
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,567
When you recover the Seed...

403
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:24,900
I only have one good
hand. We need you. I can't...

404
00:18:24,971 --> 00:18:26,531
There's something
Master Magicians know.

405
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:30,276
You can never fully control
external Circumstances.

406
00:18:30,376 --> 00:18:32,311
They may even
be actively hostile.

407
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:33,769
But you can control

408
00:18:33,846 --> 00:18:34,846
the ones inside you.

409
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:38,781
And one hand is plenty.

410
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,815
I've always known
you'll get there.

411
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:46,023
But today? Try. Okay?

412
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:47,993
Just try.

413
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,158
Go. Now. Hurry.

414
00:18:53,733 --> 00:18:55,326
Come with us. I can't.

415
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:57,562
I'm going to have
to initiate Permafrost.

416
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:00,630
It'll stop the dead using the
fountains to get to other worlds.

417
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,867
Once I initiate,

418
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,485
every portal will
close within minutes.

For a Librarian,
death isn't the end.

421
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,477
It is merely a transfer
to another branch.

00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:13,580
Go.

Mm.

430
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,512
We have to run, before the
sodding fountain to Fillory's locked.

431
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,144
I'll find another way. Hmm.

Only Josh had escaped Fillory.

And the rest, they
had no way of knowing

if the Ark even worked,

00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:20,999
so they got trapped waiting.

508
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:24,036
I pushed Josh to find a way.

509
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:27,870
And the Seed, they
tried it here, and failed.

Then Zelda took them
to the Neitherlands.

511

They never came back.

00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:36,024
Why didn't you tell them
not to do that, either?

00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:37,641
I tried!

514
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,378
They wouldn't listen.

515
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:41,079
And Jane said not to do too much

516
00:23:41,186 --> 00:23:43,314
or that might do more damage.

517
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,955
It's a tricky business.

518
00:23:47,393 --> 00:23:49,385
But she was adamant that I try.

519

it, pregnant with my mother?

It is the only way
to stop your brother.

Best we can do is to try to stop

I'll still be here, in
the Clock Barrens.

532

Without Fillory, it would be

533
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:41,608
a little bit harder to find me.

So, Julia?

535
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:49,619
Look, I had no idea that Fogg
would suddenly attack her.

536
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,423
Fogg didn't attack last time?

537
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,187
No. I have no idea why
he would. Wait. Wait.

538
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:57,657
Fogg remembers time loops.

539
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,356
What if he remembered
something and is...

540
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:03,033
He's trying to change this one.

still Fogg under there.

545
00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:15,123
Well, how do we
get rid of the shag?

manage, in your way.

Good. Tell Kady

Why did you attack Julia?

568
00:26:17,376 --> 00:26:20,369
Because she and
your child would die

569
00:26:20,446 --> 00:26:23,348
if Eleanor had performed
the goddamn surgery.

Last time you
realized far too late.

580
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:46,394
The only catch is,

581
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:48,100
you need to attach
it to someone else.

582
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:50,540

or let it die?

00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:09,311
Come with me if
you want to live.

707
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:11,582
Penny?

708
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:13,413
Yeah, sorry. Josh
wanted me to say it.

709
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:15,118
It seemed real important
to him. Come on.

710
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:35,940
I've never cast magic before.

711
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:37,600
And you're not casting now, Fen.

712
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:39,109
FEN: I'm just happy
to be included.

713
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,042
I feel all tingly. (CHUCKLES)

714
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:43,440
Is that what casting
magic feels like?

715
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:46,416
Too late to swap her out for
Kady? JOSH: Don't be mean.

716
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:48,612
Look, I haven't
spent time in Fillory,

717
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,416
unless you want your new world

718
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:53,219
looking like the Lower
East Side, then...

719
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:54,452
ELIOT: I could try.

720
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:58,394
Lipson said it's too
soon. Permanent damage.

721
00:34:58,463 --> 00:34:59,463
I just want to help.

722
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:03,560
The moon is
cranky, Zelda's gone,

723
00:35:03,635 --> 00:35:06,571
and Alice is down a hand, so...

724
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:08,304
(DOOR CLOSES) ALICE: Um...

725
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,568
I know something
that might help.

726
00:35:12,077 --> 00:35:14,376
You cracked the code on
moon Circumstances? Nope.

727
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:15,937
Then what the hell is your plan?

728
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:22,753
My plan is, I'm going to accept
exactly everything I am right now.

729
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:26,858
Instagram that nonsense
later, girl. (LAUGHS) I mean...

730
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,393
Every single good
and shitty part.

731
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:32,090
And especially the shit.

732
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:34,132
I suggest we all do it.

733
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:38,725
We have to acknowledge it in
order to adjust for it in your casting.

734
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:41,637
Internal Circumstances.

735
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,803
It's the one thing
we can control.

736

your minds, okay?

740
00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:04,153
Too late to pee?

741
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:08,232

fine. It's fine. Sorry.

Talk to it.

Um, okay. Okay.

750

Uh, I remember the...
The Silver Banks,

751
00:36:57,849 --> 00:36:59,579
and Chatwin's Torrent

752
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:03,382
and, uh, (INHALES)
the Chankly Bore.

753

Whoa, that was
weird. (CHUCKLING)

754
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:11,425
I, uh... There's, uh,
Broken Bay. And...

755
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:15,357
Nothing's happening.
The fuck, Fen?

756
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:17,197
ALICE: You can't
just describe it.

757
00:37:17,936 --> 00:37:19,598
You need to give
it your memories.

758
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:21,371
Oh.

759
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,840
Okay.

760
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:26,108
My Fillory.

(BREATHES HEAVILY)

762
00:37:30,315 --> 00:37:34,047
I remember the first time...

763
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:37,447
I saw a Pegasus.

764
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:39,923
I was 10.

765
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,553
Only in Fillory.

766
00:37:43,628 --> 00:37:46,894
I remember the first time

767
00:37:48,566 --> 00:37:52,594
I saw my dad use
magic to make a knife.

768
00:37:52,704 --> 00:37:54,798
And then he wouldn't show me

769
00:37:54,906 --> 00:37:55,930
'cause I'm a girl.

770
00:37:56,808 --> 00:38:00,267
I remember my dad gave
me away to a stranger.

771
00:38:00,345 --> 00:38:02,314
And that's where I realized

772
00:38:02,914 --> 00:38:05,907
Fillory kind of sucks sometimes.

773
00:38:05,984 --> 00:38:06,984
What are you doing?

774
00:38:07,085 --> 00:38:08,576
FEN: I'm talking
about my Fillory.

775
00:38:08,653 --> 00:38:11,748
That place could be,
uh, backwards as shit.

776
00:38:12,891 --> 00:38:16,293
And I'm thinking I don't
want to replicate that.

777
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:19,260
We kind of need
a Wellspring, so...

778
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:21,125
(LAUGHS) Right.

779
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:31,839
Can't I just have
the best of Fillory,

780
00:38:31,943 --> 00:38:34,435
the best of us, of Earth.

781
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:40,145
Plus the best of those cool movies
Todd and I watched. (LAUGHS)

782

That's the home I want.

783

Well, how's it feel?

789
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,396
Like I'm holding a
goddamn crazy cat.

790
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:34,734
And the fur is ruining
my custom suits.

791
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:38,169
No wonder all those Bond
villains were always so pissy.

complain while you're holding it.

Why should anything be easy?

798
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:54,081
Maybe we should take a
cue from the hedge witches.

and teaching would help,

but it hasn't.

alone without them.

00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:51,188
Where do you think they are?

884
00:44:51,255 --> 00:44:53,724
Maybe they got sucked
into the World Seed

885
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:56,157
because it needed matter
to turn into a new world.

886
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:59,088
Maybe it didn't work
and they got vaporized.

887
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:00,256
And yet...

888
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:03,459
we still have magic.

889
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:10,239
Somewhere, a
Wellspring exists. Yeah.

890
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:27,067
Look what I found!
(EXCLAIMS EXCITEDLY)

891
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:28,719
Turns out this
place has knife trees!

892
00:45:28,826 --> 00:45:30,055
I mean, if Josh could find

893
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:32,687
naturally occurring pizza
ovens, then why not?

894
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:34,026
JOSH: Hey, guys.

895
00:45:34,098 --> 00:45:38,297
Found a margherita
here if anyone is hungry.

896
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:41,481
(SIGHS) This
definitely isn't Fillory.

897
00:45:41,505 --> 00:45:44,031
ALICE: Yeah, but
it's not not Fillory.

898
00:45:44,609 --> 00:45:46,077
Kind of smells the same, right?

899
00:45:46,143 --> 00:45:49,443
The opium made
it, that's a plus.

900
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:53,051
I passed a field
of bacon, crispy.

901
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:54,745
Is that a Fillory thing? Mm.

902
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:56,514
More of a me thing.

903
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:59,079
Well, the air is breathable,

904
00:45:59,156 --> 00:46:00,784
food galore,

905
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:03,326
no predators in the vicinity.

906
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,793
Is it time?

907
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:07,090
No?

908
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:09,895
If we let them out, we have
to tell them we're utterly lost.

909
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:12,493
No idea where we are,
and not a bunny in sight

910
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,435
to get a message to our friends.

911
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:18,272
And they'll be homesick and
scared and cranky and hungry.

912
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:22,402
We'll have to build
infrastructure from scratch.

913
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:27,418
So, who wants to do the honors?

914
00:46:27,485 --> 00:46:29,920
You carried the whole
world in your cooch.

915
00:46:30,755 --> 00:46:31,755
You earned it.

916
00:46:31,822 --> 00:46:32,983
(LAUGHS)

917
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,657
Thanks for saying that.

918
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,753
But new Fillory needs a leader.

919
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:42,891
And as its literal birth mother,

920
00:46:43,934 --> 00:46:45,664
I feel I get to say,

921
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:51,840
I hereby dub thee High
King Margo the Creator.

922
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:52,942
Whoo!

923
00:46:54,912 --> 00:46:55,912
Fine.

924
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,141
Make a meal out of it.

925
00:46:58,616 --> 00:47:01,142
You guys know our lives
are about to get even weirder,

926
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:03,653
in some insane way we
can't possibly predict?

927
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:05,188
ALICE: I mean, yes. Yes.

928
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:07,121
I mean... Yes. FEN: Yes.

929
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:11,322
But I find that somehow...
perversely comforting.

930
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:12,761
ALICE: So do I.

931
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:17,166
That's how I
know it's our story.

932
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:25,675
(CLICKS)

933
00:47:26,811 --> 00:47:28,712
