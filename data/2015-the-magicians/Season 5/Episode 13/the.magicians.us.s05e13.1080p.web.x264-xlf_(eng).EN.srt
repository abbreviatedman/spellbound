00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:08,910
<i>- Previously
on "The Magicians"...</i>

2
00:00:08,934 --> 00:00:11,177
- God.
Shut up.

3
00:00:11,254 --> 00:00:13,629
What's happening to you

4
00:00:13,706 --> 00:00:16,590
looks just like what
happened to my mom.

5
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:18,495
<i>The episodes didn't stop
when I was born.</i>

6
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,186
They got worse.

7
00:00:20,263 --> 00:00:21,832
- When she's alone,
everything's normal,

8
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:23,138
but when you show up...

9
00:00:23,173 --> 00:00:25,691
- I still mess her up.

10
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:27,579
<i>- The creatures
you call Takers...</i>

11
00:00:27,603 --> 00:00:29,195
<i>Do you know what they are?</i>

12
00:00:29,272 --> 00:00:31,313
<i>They are guard dogs.</i>

13
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,526
Their realm is
a security measure,

14
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,846
a barrier between your world
and the world of the Dead.

15
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,778
- The Dead will ruin Fillory.

16
00:00:37,813 --> 00:00:40,259
We must stop this,
whatever the cost.

17
00:00:40,283 --> 00:00:43,117
- Well, the cost is blowing up
the entire planet, which is...

18
00:00:43,152 --> 00:00:44,279
- A decent option.

19
00:00:44,303 --> 00:00:46,357
<i>- In the center of Fillory
is a clockwork heart</i>

20
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:47,381
<i>built by dwarves.</i>

21
00:00:47,456 --> 00:00:49,526
<i>- If I wound the clock
backward, it would...</i>

22
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,677
It would destroy Fillory.

23
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:53,530
- What about the World Seed,
from Q's page?

24
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:56,222
If we could find it, we could
use it to build a new world...

25
00:00:56,299 --> 00:00:57,368
A new Fillory.

26
00:00:57,392 --> 00:00:59,185
- I intended to rescue my people

27
00:00:59,209 --> 00:01:00,559
from this chaotic place,

28
00:01:00,636 --> 00:01:02,873
so I also built an ark.

29
00:01:02,897 --> 00:01:03,874
- How do they feel?

30
00:01:03,898 --> 00:01:04,966
- Like ghost fingers.

31
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:08,350
They work, but magically
they still feel severed.

32
00:01:08,427 --> 00:01:09,471
<i>- The Couple just got
the last thing they need.</i>

33
00:01:09,495 --> 00:01:11,698
<i>They have the Seed,
the Page, and the Panel.</i>

34
00:01:11,722 --> 00:01:12,479
<i>We got to tell the others.</i>

35
00:01:12,514 --> 00:01:14,701
They need to steal
that seed now.

36
00:01:14,725 --> 00:01:16,553
- Guys, Alice has an exit.

37
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:17,646
<i>Get to the roof.</i>

38
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,580
Ho, ho, ho, motherfuckers.

Extracted & corrected by
DvX3M

40
00:01:31,742 --> 00:01:33,404
Hey, Alice.

41
00:01:33,428 --> 00:01:36,407
- Ooh, did I sleep
till December?

42
00:01:36,431 --> 00:01:38,431
- I couldn't resist giving out
a few more gifts

43
00:01:38,507 --> 00:01:39,598
while I'm here.

44
00:01:39,675 --> 00:01:42,435
Given your quest-heavy
lifestyle,

45
00:01:42,511 --> 00:01:43,897
there's no guarantee
that any of you

46
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:45,554
will live to see Christmas.

47
00:01:45,631 --> 00:01:46,939
Sit.
Have a cookie.

48
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:53,612
- What is that?

49
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:55,426
- No idea.
It's for Eliot.

50
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,691
- Is that a Microplane for Josh?

51
00:01:57,768 --> 00:01:59,285
He already has six.

52
00:01:59,362 --> 00:02:00,955
- Do you question
how you bend light?

53
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:03,906
Well, I don't question
how I pick gifts.

54
00:02:03,982 --> 00:02:06,542
Here, put your finger
right here, please.

55
00:02:10,373 --> 00:02:12,039
Looking for yours?

56
00:02:12,116 --> 00:02:13,610
You already got it.

57
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,801
Long time back.

58
00:02:18,288 --> 00:02:21,548
I put it in a locked drawer
in Quentin's desk.

59
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:24,718
- What, you... you gave me that?

60
00:02:24,753 --> 00:02:27,646
- So what did the page
turn out to say?

61
00:02:27,723 --> 00:02:30,983
- It was... was a spell.
It...

62
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,936
grew a seed into a world,
but why did you put it there?

63
00:02:34,012 --> 00:02:35,299
What if I'd ignored it or...

64
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:37,784
- But you didn't.
You needed something-

65
00:02:37,808 --> 00:02:38,993
get back in the game.

66
00:02:39,017 --> 00:02:40,637
You weren't gonna pass
on a mystery

67
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:43,221
you thought your guy
was working on.

68
00:02:45,741 --> 00:02:48,645
I'm very sorry for your loss.

69
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,795
- It really sucks.

70
00:02:52,448 --> 00:02:54,840
- Well, now you know.

71
00:02:54,917 --> 00:02:56,728
That page and wherever
that quest took you,

72
00:02:56,752 --> 00:02:58,419
wasn't his story.

73
00:02:58,495 --> 00:02:59,748
It was yours, Alice.

74
00:02:59,772 --> 00:03:03,015
For what it's worth, I think
he'd be really proud of you...

75
00:03:03,092 --> 00:03:05,851
The way you keep on fighting.

76
00:03:05,928 --> 00:03:10,000
I told you... I told you
you were good.

77
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:15,027
I still don't know
if that's true.

78
00:03:15,104 --> 00:03:18,008
- Hey.
This is how it works.

79
00:03:18,032 --> 00:03:19,606
You do your best.

80
00:03:19,683 --> 00:03:23,013
You fuck up, get hurt.
People die.

81
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:26,447
Except for the odd Microplane,

82
00:03:26,523 --> 00:03:28,852
jack shit gets wrapped
up in a bow.

83
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:32,786
you know, you're
a real ray of sunshine, Santa.

84
00:03:32,863 --> 00:03:34,691
- Ho, ho, ho.

85
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:37,677
Shit.

86
00:03:37,701 --> 00:03:39,471
Creatures stirring.

87
00:03:45,634 --> 00:03:48,969
What the pumpkin spice fuck?

88
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,473
My God.

89
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:55,309
These are sold out
literally everywhere.

90
00:03:55,385 --> 00:03:56,252
Thanks, Santa.

91
00:03:56,328 --> 00:03:58,737
This is wrapped
really tight.

92
00:03:58,814 --> 00:03:59,738
- Santa got me a bracelet?

93
00:03:59,815 --> 00:04:00,959
- It's the exact right grade

94
00:04:00,983 --> 00:04:02,911
for the truffle-shaving
technique...

95
00:04:02,935 --> 00:04:04,410
- This is so thoughtful.

96
00:04:04,487 --> 00:04:05,964
- José Andrés showed me
the last time we hung out.

97
00:04:05,988 --> 00:04:07,582
What is this even for?

98
00:04:07,606 --> 00:04:09,801
- A-fucking-plus.
This is handy and sort of chic.

99
00:04:09,825 --> 00:04:12,534
- It's a surprise!
I love surprises.

100
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:14,587
- Is this baby shit?

101
00:04:14,663 --> 00:04:17,401
- Yep.
It's baby shit.

102
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:20,050
- Fillory needs you.
Now!

103
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,338
- Achtung,<i> miscreants.</i>

104
00:04:24,373 --> 00:04:27,508
There is no uncrucial
portion of this.

105
00:04:27,584 --> 00:04:29,488
As per several
super-chatty bunnies

106
00:04:29,512 --> 00:04:30,605
from our super buddy Rafe,

107
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:32,029
the Dark King
is planning on opening

108
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:34,440
a portal
to the Underworld tonight.

109
00:04:34,517 --> 00:04:36,850
Now, here's the plan.

110
00:04:36,927 --> 00:04:39,612
Part the first...

111
00:04:39,688 --> 00:04:42,564
Rapture Fillory.
Margo and I will go to Fillory.

112
00:04:42,641 --> 00:04:44,066
Activate Umber's Ark.

113
00:04:44,142 --> 00:04:45,596
And then we go
to the Clockwork Heart.

114
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,362
- How will you know
they're all raptured?

115
00:04:48,438 --> 00:04:49,905
Everyone?

116
00:04:49,982 --> 00:04:52,741
- Wait, um, I know a thingy.

117
00:04:52,818 --> 00:04:54,460
It's in the castle,

118
00:04:54,537 --> 00:04:56,089
so if we just go there
and grab it...

119
00:04:56,113 --> 00:04:57,037
- Great.
Moving on.

120
00:04:57,114 --> 00:04:58,705
We will turn back the clock,

121
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,800
and then we get ready
to say good-bye to Fillory.

122
00:05:01,877 --> 00:05:04,114
- W-with you still on it?

123
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:06,755
- Obviously not.
We need to GTFO.

124
00:05:06,832 --> 00:05:08,715
- You need a traveler.

125
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,716
- 23 can't aim.

126
00:05:09,751 --> 00:05:12,478
His pervo buddy Hyman's
not speaking to us,

127
00:05:12,555 --> 00:05:14,480
Gavin's still in the hospital.

128
00:05:14,557 --> 00:05:17,483
Peach,
or whatever your name is.

129
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,228
- Unfortunately, when I travel,
it's kind of through time.

130
00:05:21,305 --> 00:05:22,799
- And puts you in the crosshairs

131
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,156
of a time psycho, so, no.

132
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:26,492
- Meanwhile, on Earth,

133
00:05:26,569 --> 00:05:28,735
Team WorldSeed...

134
00:05:28,812 --> 00:05:32,643
Alice, Fen, Zelda,
you will retrieve the Seed

135
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:36,076
from its special container
and... bloom it.

136
00:05:36,153 --> 00:05:39,483
- Where?
- It's in my vagina.

137
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:40,484
Great.

138
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:43,175
I mean, circumstances are wacky.

139
00:05:43,252 --> 00:05:45,179
Won't that make it tough to...
- Neitherlands.

140
00:05:45,203 --> 00:05:45,952
More stable there.

141
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,514
- Wouldn't Fillory
be better, since...

142
00:05:48,591 --> 00:05:49,515
- Not at all.

143
00:05:49,592 --> 00:05:52,851
In fact, counterproductive,
given imploding.

144
00:05:52,928 --> 00:05:54,239
- Okay, Peach,
I get you're nervous,

145
00:05:54,263 --> 00:05:55,999
but this isn't
our first donkey show,

146
00:05:56,023 --> 00:06:00,693
which leads me to something
actually crucial to the plan.

147
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:02,861
No presh, but...

148
00:06:02,938 --> 00:06:06,009
New Fillory better
have a wellspring.

149
00:06:08,611 --> 00:06:10,944
Or we permanently lose magic.

150
00:06:11,021 --> 00:06:14,039
- The spell says we can make
the Seed anything,

151
00:06:14,116 --> 00:06:15,616
so it should be doable.

152
00:06:15,692 --> 00:06:17,710
- Great. Now...

153
00:06:17,786 --> 00:06:19,453
questions, anyone?

154
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:21,788
- No?
And break.

155
00:06:23,075 --> 00:06:24,795
- Was I funny?
- No.

156
00:06:24,868 --> 00:06:26,029
My water just broke.

157
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,628
Whoa!

158
00:06:27,704 --> 00:06:29,223
- Ooh, okay.
- Go time!

159
00:06:29,247 --> 00:06:30,867
- Okay.
Just calm down.

160
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,611
- Are you okay?
- Go, let's go.

161
00:06:44,813 --> 00:06:46,980
- Ready as we can be.
ETA?

162
00:06:47,057 --> 00:06:48,293
- Julia should be here
in under five.

163
00:06:48,317 --> 00:06:50,651
- Help!
I need help!

164
00:06:50,727 --> 00:06:52,705
- What the hell happened to him?

165
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:54,747
The etheric realm.

166
00:06:54,823 --> 00:06:56,059
A lot of it.

167
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,636
- This is our Fogg?
You're sure?

168
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,600
- Yeah.
- Okay.

169
00:06:58,677 --> 00:06:59,534
- When we sent Psycho Fogg
to the realm,

170
00:06:59,611 --> 00:07:01,732
it spit ours back out.

171
00:07:01,756 --> 00:07:04,665
- He called me.
He couldn't really talk.

172
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,500
- Okay, Henry?

173
00:07:06,576 --> 00:07:08,927
Are you in there?

174
00:07:09,004 --> 00:07:10,556
- Hey.
We're here!

175
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,558
- Push fluids,
cast Adler's Sedation.

176
00:07:12,582 --> 00:07:13,577
Henry, be with you soon.

177
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:15,228
With me.
Showtime.

178
00:07:15,252 --> 00:07:16,602
<i>- No!</i>

179
00:07:16,679 --> 00:07:18,679
Hard pass, as the kids say.

180
00:07:18,755 --> 00:07:20,272
<i>Nyet!</i>
Indian yes.

181
00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:22,516
Hell, no.

182
00:07:22,592 --> 00:07:23,754
Anyway, I'm not speaking to you.

183
00:07:23,778 --> 00:07:25,330
- Just wait.
Do you not understand?

184
00:07:25,354 --> 00:07:26,779
- Do you not understand?

185
00:07:26,855 --> 00:07:31,261
You're asking me to travel
as a world explodes?

186
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,786
Can you promise me

187
00:07:33,862 --> 00:07:36,789
no debris will hit me
on my head?

188
00:07:36,865 --> 00:07:38,918
- Well, no, but...
- Things on my head hurt!

189
00:07:38,942 --> 00:07:40,867
- Life is pain.
Ovary up.

190
00:07:40,944 --> 00:07:42,035
- I am not a hero.

191
00:07:42,112 --> 00:07:44,963
I am a man tethered to a machine

192
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,873
for poop and humiliation,

193
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,112
and I abhor it.

194
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,280
I said good day.

195
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,282
I have an idea.

196
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:54,548
Hi.
How was your nap?

197
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,695
- Refreshing.
You need him to travel?

198
00:07:56,719 --> 00:07:58,288
- Yeah.

199
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:00,813
What?

200
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:02,108
He would never.
- Yes, he would.

201
00:08:02,132 --> 00:08:03,443
- No way.
- Absolutely.

202
00:08:03,467 --> 00:08:04,391
Hey.

203
00:08:04,468 --> 00:08:06,154
Hyman?
- Can't squawk.

204
00:08:06,178 --> 00:08:07,894
Getting blistered.

205
00:08:07,971 --> 00:08:09,157
- Listen.

206
00:08:09,181 --> 00:08:11,657
I have a man in my head.

207
00:08:12,901 --> 00:08:14,304
He's looking for a body.

208
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:17,808
And you have one that...

209
00:08:17,832 --> 00:08:18,958
You don't even really want.

210
00:08:18,982 --> 00:08:21,074
- Jesus.
No way he goes for this.

211
00:08:21,151 --> 00:08:23,980
You're an idiot, Charlton.

212
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:27,005
- He wants to take this?

213
00:08:27,082 --> 00:08:30,751
And I would... what?

214
00:08:30,827 --> 00:08:32,252
Stay in the Astral forever?

215
00:08:32,287 --> 00:08:34,182
- Well, you could,
or you could...

216
00:08:34,206 --> 00:08:36,590
- Emphatically yes!

217
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:39,017
My God!
On one condition.

218
00:08:39,094 --> 00:08:40,163
- Okay.

219
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,429
- Your head pal

220
00:08:42,506 --> 00:08:45,974
has to do weird things
with my body.

221
00:08:46,051 --> 00:08:49,436
S... sex things.

222
00:08:49,471 --> 00:08:51,842
- Okay.
- What's his name?

223
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:53,198
- Charlton.

224
00:08:53,275 --> 00:08:57,035
- No act too depraved, Charlton.

225
00:08:58,688 --> 00:09:00,781
I'll be watching...

226
00:09:00,816 --> 00:09:02,783
whether you like it or not.

227
00:09:02,859 --> 00:09:04,209
- What have we done?

228
00:09:04,286 --> 00:09:06,380
- I'm prepped to sever
the energetic umbilical

229
00:09:06,404 --> 00:09:08,663
once baby's here, but, um...

230
00:09:08,698 --> 00:09:11,884
well, I've never done it.
- What?

231
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,938
- It's a unicorn baby.
It's your kid.

232
00:09:13,962 --> 00:09:15,128
It is what it is.

233
00:09:15,205 --> 00:09:15,995
Anyway, listen.

234
00:09:16,073 --> 00:09:18,840
You want drugs, girl?
Say it now.

235
00:09:21,303 --> 00:09:24,471
Unicorn baby time.
Let's do this.

236
00:09:26,975 --> 00:09:28,119
- It's okay.
It's okay.

237
00:09:28,143 --> 00:09:30,861
- Eliot, Hyman, Charlton,
wake up.

238
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:37,462
- Did it work?

239
00:09:44,993 --> 00:09:47,753
Gods.

240
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,232
I'm tall.

241
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,924
- Great.
Let's test that traveling out.

242
00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:00,265
This is the best episode ever.

243
00:10:03,086 --> 00:10:05,749
- Just relax, okay?
Breathe.

244
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,851
Why can't I do this?

245
00:10:10,927 --> 00:10:12,905
- Just give it a minute.
- We don't have a minute.

246
00:10:12,929 --> 00:10:13,948
We have a world to destroy/save.

247
00:10:13,972 --> 00:10:15,926
- He just got in that body!
- He can't travel!

248
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,577
- I want to help.
- We'll be okay.

249
00:10:17,601 --> 00:10:19,170
- Will we?
- Yes.

250
00:10:19,194 --> 00:10:20,746
I know a shortcut
to the portal tree.

251
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:21,914
We just got to run.

252
00:10:21,938 --> 00:10:23,405
- What, shortcut?

253
00:10:23,481 --> 00:10:24,843
- Yeah, you never
mentioned that before...

254
00:10:24,867 --> 00:10:26,959
- I wanted one shortcut
just for me.

255
00:10:27,035 --> 00:10:28,126
Let's go.

256
00:10:28,203 --> 00:10:29,962
Thanks for trying, Charlton.

257
00:10:30,038 --> 00:10:31,463
<i>Andale.</i>

258
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:36,209
- Hey...
- Eliot.

259
00:10:36,244 --> 00:10:37,928
Come back safe.

260
00:10:40,123 --> 00:10:41,306
- Of course.

261
00:10:47,055 --> 00:10:49,459
- Dean Fogg?

262
00:10:58,901 --> 00:11:00,901
- Way easier to get in than out.

263
00:11:00,977 --> 00:11:02,806
Like so many things in life.

264
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,279
This will keep the Seed safe...

265
00:11:04,356 --> 00:11:06,142
for a short time.

266
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,478
We should begin.

267
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,913
- Fogg?
Why aren't you in bed?

268
00:11:12,989 --> 00:11:14,893
- Henry, are you all right?
- Fogg?

269
00:11:14,917 --> 00:11:17,094
Henry, what are you doing?

270
00:11:18,253 --> 00:11:21,013
- Wait here.
I'll get him.

271
00:11:34,028 --> 00:11:37,437
- You're my last messenger.
Listen carefully.

272
00:11:37,472 --> 00:11:40,482
Tell High King Margo to...

273
00:11:40,558 --> 00:11:42,150
- Hurry!

274
00:11:42,227 --> 00:11:44,369
- We're goddamn trying!
Thanks!

275
00:11:44,446 --> 00:11:46,780
- Got it.

276
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:51,543
- What's this now?
- A royal census scroll.

277
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,379
You see?

278
00:11:54,456 --> 00:11:56,192
Two people just died,

279
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,717
and a fairy was born.

280
00:11:58,794 --> 00:12:01,197
- Hatched. So we can see
when they're being raptured.

281
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,629
- I love it when a good lay

282
00:12:02,706 --> 00:12:04,442
turns out to have
a working brain, don't you?

283
00:12:04,466 --> 00:12:06,633
- Yeah.
That Josh is a keeper.

284
00:12:06,668 --> 00:12:10,178
- Well, there's a button
under here.

285
00:12:10,255 --> 00:12:12,439
It begins!

286
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,545
- Hey, I think it's working.

287
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,217
- Great, but go faster.

288
00:12:28,273 --> 00:12:29,709
- I think it's picking up speed

289
00:12:29,733 --> 00:12:31,302
now that all
the squirrels are in.

290
00:12:31,326 --> 00:12:33,396
- Hey, El, you think we should...

291
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:39,091
- Raptured?
He's not Fillorian.

292
00:12:40,669 --> 00:12:43,169
- You okay?

293
00:12:43,246 --> 00:12:46,047
I'm not great at that spell,
even with enhancement.

294
00:12:47,101 --> 00:12:47,841
- Don't worry.
He's dead.

295
00:12:47,876 --> 00:12:50,246
They're all dead.
So it's time.

296
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,437
Follow me close.

297
00:12:52,514 --> 00:12:54,389
Figured you'd come to Fillory...

298
00:12:54,466 --> 00:12:59,277
what, with your translator
spying so diligently.

299
00:12:59,354 --> 00:13:01,521
I thought I'd cut to the chase.

300
00:13:01,598 --> 00:13:03,565
And just bring you here
to the Taker Realm

301
00:13:03,641 --> 00:13:05,595
to ask for your help.

302
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,694
Well...

303
00:13:07,771 --> 00:13:09,204
not ask.

304
00:13:10,532 --> 00:13:13,199
The final door.

305
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:17,129
- It's a girl.

306
00:13:17,205 --> 00:13:18,964
She's beautiful.

307
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:21,541
Not that it's about that.
I mean, she's healthy.

308
00:13:21,618 --> 00:13:24,280
- Okay, let's celebrate
on the B-side of surgery.

309
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,304
- You are a warrior.

310
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,527
- Is she up?
Is she okay?

311
00:13:29,551 --> 00:13:30,603
Is Lipson?
- Yeah.

312
00:13:30,627 --> 00:13:31,977
She's as prepped as she can be.

313
00:13:32,054 --> 00:13:33,456
- Okay.
- Okay.

314
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,199
You doing okay?
- Okay, good.

315
00:13:35,223 --> 00:13:37,599
Goggles?

316
00:13:37,675 --> 00:13:41,102
All right.
Okay.

317
00:13:41,179 --> 00:13:43,488
Number 14 scalpel, Selenite.

318
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:48,326
Okay, start with the baby.

319
00:13:50,238 --> 00:13:54,074
Shouldn't hurt either of you.
Just, you know, don't move.

320
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:59,245
- Dean Fogg?
What are you doing?

321
00:13:59,322 --> 00:14:01,081
Wait.

322
00:14:01,157 --> 00:14:03,508
Wait, Dean.
Please.

323
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:14,497
- Where the hell is the Seed?

324
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:15,637
- Julia?

325
00:14:15,713 --> 00:14:17,167
Julia?
- Is she okay?

326
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:18,317
- Lipson!
Jules!

327
00:14:18,341 --> 00:14:20,266
Julia.

328
00:14:20,301 --> 00:14:23,028
- I know you're worried.

329
00:14:23,105 --> 00:14:25,366
But it's all going to be okay...

330
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,773
because of you.

331
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,179
There is a danger,
once this door opens,

332
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:31,653
more dead will come through.

333
00:14:31,729 --> 00:14:33,183
- This is insane.

334
00:14:33,207 --> 00:14:35,749
- Not if you seal it fast.

335
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,023
- You didn't just
bring me here to help you.

336
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:42,122
You knew that
I would try to stop you.

337
00:14:42,198 --> 00:14:43,693
And deep down...

338
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,125
I know you want that, too.

339
00:14:47,162 --> 00:14:48,128
- If I wanted you to stop me,

340
00:14:48,163 --> 00:14:51,056
I wouldn't have cast
on that door 20 minutes ago.

341
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:55,705
Right on time.

342
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,303
- Seb.
Seb, don't do this.

343
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,815
<i>- Rupert!
Rupert.</i>

344
00:15:01,143 --> 00:15:02,212
- Lance.

345
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:04,569
Eliot, seal the door.

346
00:15:04,646 --> 00:15:08,384
My love, my stars, my heart.

347
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:10,650
We did it.

348
00:15:10,727 --> 00:15:12,744
Touch me.

349
00:15:12,821 --> 00:15:13,873
- I can't.

350
00:15:13,897 --> 00:15:16,081
- You can't kill me.
I can't die.

351
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,170
- You mean it?
We can...

352
00:15:21,237 --> 00:15:24,164
- We can... forever.

353
00:15:29,746 --> 00:15:31,212
No!

354
00:15:31,289 --> 00:15:33,173
No.

355
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:36,101
- Hello, big brother.

356
00:15:36,178 --> 00:15:39,604
Save me, Rupert. I love you so.

357
00:15:39,681 --> 00:15:41,325
You're still so predictable.

358
00:15:41,349 --> 00:15:43,753
Your soft heart,
your stubbornness,

359
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,277
your stupidity.

360
00:15:45,353 --> 00:15:46,611
- What did you do to him?

361
00:15:46,688 --> 00:15:48,332
- Who?
Lance?

362
00:15:48,356 --> 00:15:49,856
Never even met him.

363
00:15:49,933 --> 00:15:53,618
He must have moved on
centuries ago.

364
00:16:02,403 --> 00:16:03,369
- Spent some time in the Library

365
00:16:03,404 --> 00:16:06,131
with my batty old
writer friend, Cassandra,

366
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,800
reading about the lengths
you were going to

367
00:16:08,877 --> 00:16:10,376
to save him.

368
00:16:10,411 --> 00:16:12,857
You didn't work nearly
so hard to save me...

369
00:16:12,881 --> 00:16:14,756
from Plover.

370
00:16:14,832 --> 00:16:16,786
Did you?

371
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,455
- Of course I did...

372
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,790
until I couldn't.

373
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:23,723
I had to save everyone from you.

374
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,725
You chose the dark path.

375
00:16:25,802 --> 00:16:29,487
Says the Dark King.

376
00:16:29,564 --> 00:16:32,635
Anyways, reading about you
made me realize,

377
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:35,735
after everything you
did to stop me,

378
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:38,663
you were going to give me
everything I needed

379
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,643
to have Fillory...

380
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,334
forever.

381
00:16:45,247 --> 00:16:47,172
All I needed to do

382
00:16:47,249 --> 00:16:51,487
was make a few judicious
political promises.

383
00:16:58,426 --> 00:17:00,496
Leave it open.
More will follow.

384
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,665
And of, course, I had
to make peace with the fact

385
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,150
that we would need
to kill everyone.

386
00:17:05,174 --> 00:17:07,837
But what good
are the living, really?

387
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:10,340
The world's better off with me.

388
00:17:15,277 --> 00:17:16,557
You're the sad little addict

389
00:17:16,611 --> 00:17:18,681
that tagged along
with Julia and Quentin.

390
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:22,540
How in the blazes are you still
alive after all this time?

391
00:17:29,457 --> 00:17:31,833
No matter.

392
00:17:31,909 --> 00:17:33,363
So much to do!

393
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:36,504
Let's go.

394
00:17:36,581 --> 00:17:39,507
Onward to the land
of the living, friends.

395
00:17:39,584 --> 00:17:41,643
All the lands of the living.

396
00:17:46,173 --> 00:17:47,506
<i>- Kady should be back by now.</i>

397
00:17:47,584 --> 00:17:49,545
This doesn't feel right.
We should leave.

398
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:50,752
- We can't.

399
00:17:50,829 --> 00:17:52,548
I'm certain we won't be able
to cast precisely enough

400
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,199
if we...

401
00:17:54,223 --> 00:17:55,885
What was that?

402
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:57,720
- Kady?
Is that you?

403
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,391
- # A-hunting we will go #

404
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:03,656
# A-hunting we will go #

405
00:18:03,691 --> 00:18:05,895
# Heigh-ho the derry-o #

406
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,660
- # A-hunting we will go #

407
00:18:07,695 --> 00:18:09,495
- I know that voice.

408
00:18:09,572 --> 00:18:10,997
It's The Beast.

409
00:18:11,074 --> 00:18:12,999
No, I killed him myself!

410
00:18:13,076 --> 00:18:15,543
- Then the Dead have risen.
Follow me.

411
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,878
- Hello, friends.

412
00:18:16,954 --> 00:18:19,347
We've come to bring
death everywhere.

413
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:24,271
- This room is warded,
but not for long.

414
00:18:24,295 --> 00:18:26,523
That way... a portal will take
you to Brakebills.

415
00:18:26,547 --> 00:18:29,419
Go. Alice...
when you recover the Seed...

416
00:18:29,443 --> 00:18:31,776
- I-I only have one good hand.
We need you. I can't...

417
00:18:31,853 --> 00:18:33,923
- There's something
Master Magicians know.

418
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:37,231
You can never fully control
external circumstances.

419
00:18:37,308 --> 00:18:39,762
They may even be
actively hostile.

420
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:42,598
But you can control
the ones inside you.

421
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,600
And one hand...

422
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,769
is plenty.

423
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,938
I've always known
you'll get there.

424
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,870
- But today?

425
00:18:50,905 --> 00:18:53,776
- Try.
Okay?

426
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,278
Just try.

427
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:00,450
Go now.
Hurry.

428
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:02,309
- Come with us.
- I can't.

429
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,454
I'm going to have
to initiate Permafrost.

430
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:06,397
It'll stop the Dead
using the fountains

431
00:19:06,421 --> 00:19:07,640
to get to other worlds.

432
00:19:07,664 --> 00:19:10,460
Once I initiate, every portal
will close within minutes.

433
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:12,462
- We can't just leave you here.

434
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:16,062
For a librarian,
death isn't the end.

435
00:19:16,139 --> 00:19:19,469
It is merely a transfer
to another branch.

436
00:19:19,493 --> 00:19:20,773
Go.

437
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,477
Wait, Zelda.

438
00:19:27,501 --> 00:19:30,480
Thank you...
for everything.

439
00:19:40,088 --> 00:19:42,492
- Hello, noble Librarian.

440
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:46,496
- Did you just...

441
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:48,756
- We have to run...

442
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,815
before the sodding fountain
to Fillory's locked.

443
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,506
I'll find another way.

444
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,532
Not that you'll be
here to see it.

445
00:20:06,189 --> 00:20:08,017
So lovely.

446
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:14,932
- Eliot, stop!
Eliot, wait!

447
00:20:16,991 --> 00:20:19,362
You took your shot.
You destroyed the entire world.

448
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:20,621
Will you just leave it...

449
00:20:20,645 --> 00:20:23,533
- Please... please, let me just
at least heal your hand.

450
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:27,633
- Shh.

451
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:31,137
I survived war, losing Lance,

452
00:20:31,214 --> 00:20:33,042
my family torn apart
by a monster

453
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:34,618
who said he would take care
of my brother,

454
00:20:34,642 --> 00:20:36,546
and I thought one thing...

455
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:39,215
I just want to use magic
for one thing I want...

456
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:42,148
- You knew better.
- I had to try!

457
00:20:42,225 --> 00:20:45,651
You couldn't understand that.

458
00:20:45,686 --> 00:20:49,038
- But I do understand.
I always did.

459
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:53,367
- Eliot, what was the plan?

460
00:20:53,444 --> 00:20:56,162
Before I...

461
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,831
My friends are here.

462
00:20:58,866 --> 00:21:01,167
They're rapturing everyone
so we can destroy this planet

463
00:21:01,244 --> 00:21:03,169
that we love, by the way.

464
00:21:03,246 --> 00:21:06,506
But we have to to destroy you.

465
00:21:06,582 --> 00:21:08,549
You left us no choice, Seb.

466
00:21:08,626 --> 00:21:09,509
- That could still work.

467
00:21:09,544 --> 00:21:11,080
I could cut off the door
to the Underworld,

468
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:13,106
stop Martin bringing
anymore Dead through.

469
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,018
Don't try to cast.
You'll hurt yourself.

470
00:21:19,095 --> 00:21:20,695
- Great, not like
the zombies are coming.

471
00:21:20,763 --> 00:21:23,397
- Go.
Find your friends.

472
00:21:23,474 --> 00:21:26,095
I can hold off the Dead.
It's not like they can kill me.

473
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,597
- No, they can rip you
to shreds,

474
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:28,622
and then we'd kill you anyway.

475
00:21:28,646 --> 00:21:30,530
- Eliot, go.

476
00:21:30,606 --> 00:21:32,865
- Do you not get that
I don't want you to die?

477
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,701
You're not evil.
You're just...

478
00:21:35,736 --> 00:21:37,462
You're just
some deluded asshole...

479
00:21:39,115 --> 00:21:41,049
- That I care about.

480
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:45,637
- Who says I'll die?

481
00:21:53,087 --> 00:21:55,625
- Your daughter is healthy.
- Good.

482
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:58,057
- And Julia?

483
00:21:58,092 --> 00:22:00,487
- Has not regained
consciousness.

484
00:22:00,511 --> 00:22:01,964
- When do you expect?

485
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:03,966
- Her organs are shutting down.

486
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,550
We are trying everything, but...

487
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:10,806
- Can I see her?
- Yeah.

488
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,665
Hold tight.
- Okay.

489
00:22:19,322 --> 00:22:21,091
- Hey.
I got you some food.

490
00:22:21,115 --> 00:22:22,582
You should really eat...

491
00:22:22,617 --> 00:22:23,819
- I know I told you
you shouldn't do it.

492
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,752
But... but I will protect you,
okay, somehow.

493
00:22:26,787 --> 00:22:27,753
I know a way to get
to Jane Chatwin.

494
00:22:27,788 --> 00:22:29,266
She'll help us, and you can
go back to before...

495
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,417
- Professor...

496
00:22:30,441 --> 00:22:33,496
- You can go back and stop
Julie from dying, please.

497
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,927
- We can't.

498
00:22:34,962 --> 00:22:37,930
- Why the fuck not?

499
00:22:37,965 --> 00:22:40,525
- Because we already did.

500
00:22:48,976 --> 00:22:51,514
- What... what... what do
you mean "we already did"?

501
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:54,989
- This is the do-over.

502
00:22:55,066 --> 00:22:59,160
It got so much worse,
so fast before...

503
00:22:59,236 --> 00:23:01,691
So you took me
to my grandmother, Jane.

504
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:02,715
- Time loop...

505
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:04,830
Only way to undo time
without getting

506
00:23:04,867 --> 00:23:07,627
that grouchy time traveler's
knickers in a knot.

507
00:23:07,662 --> 00:23:09,596
Clean start.

508
00:23:11,332 --> 00:23:13,035
Big magic, though.

509
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:14,645
<i>- Unfortunately, she told me</i>

510
00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:17,637
<i>that I only had enough plasma
to do it once.</i>

511
00:23:17,672 --> 00:23:19,639
- Okay, but what...
What did you change?

512
00:23:19,674 --> 00:23:22,808
- Only Josh had escaped Fillory.

513
00:23:22,843 --> 00:23:24,880
In the West, they had
no way of knowing

514
00:23:24,904 --> 00:23:29,023
if the Ark even worked,
so they got trapped waiting.

515
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,026
I pushed Josh to find a way.

516
00:23:32,103 --> 00:23:33,861
And the Seed,

517
00:23:33,938 --> 00:23:36,197
they tried it here and failed.

518
00:23:36,273 --> 00:23:39,125
And Zelda took them
to the Neitherlands.

519
00:23:40,328 --> 00:23:41,994
They never came back.

520
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:43,996
- Why didn't you tell them
not to do that either?

521
00:23:44,031 --> 00:23:47,208
- I tried!
They wouldn't listen!

522
00:23:47,284 --> 00:23:49,096
And Jane said
not to do too much,

523
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,907
or that might do more damage.

524
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:55,049
It's a tricky business.

525
00:23:55,126 --> 00:23:57,343
But she was adamant that I try.

526
00:23:57,378 --> 00:24:00,054
Professor, we have to tell her.

527
00:24:00,131 --> 00:24:02,181
She is trapped here

528
00:24:02,216 --> 00:24:05,726
and... insane to think
about it... pregnant

529
00:24:05,803 --> 00:24:07,320
with my mother.

530
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,074
- Yes.

531
00:24:12,727 --> 00:24:14,619
Tell me what, my dears?

532
00:24:16,814 --> 00:24:19,198
- We are going
to destroy Fillory.

533
00:24:19,233 --> 00:24:21,937
With you on it.

534
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:24,170
It is the only way
to stop your brother.

535
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:32,378
- Best we can do is
to try to stop our legacy

536
00:24:32,413 --> 00:24:34,755
from hurting anybody else.

537
00:24:34,832 --> 00:24:36,924
You're doing the right thing,
both of you.

538
00:24:39,646 --> 00:24:41,887
But I won't be gone.

539
00:24:41,922 --> 00:24:44,932
I'll still be here
in the Clock Barrens.

540
00:24:45,009 --> 00:24:47,727
Without Fillory,

541
00:24:47,762 --> 00:24:50,321
it'll be a little bit
harder to find me.

542
00:24:53,184 --> 00:24:54,325
- So Julia...

543
00:24:54,402 --> 00:24:57,737
- Look, I had no idea that Fogg
would suddenly attack her.

544
00:24:57,772 --> 00:24:59,238
- Fogg didn't attack last time?

545
00:24:59,273 --> 00:25:01,251
- No, I-I have no idea
why he would.

546
00:25:01,275 --> 00:25:03,284
- Wait.
Wait!

547
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,120
Fogg remembers time loops.

548
00:25:06,197 --> 00:25:09,318
What if he remembered
something and... and is...

549
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:11,676
Is trying to change this one?

550
00:25:11,753 --> 00:25:14,795
- The etheric realm shook loose
most of his screws.

551
00:25:14,872 --> 00:25:17,256
He's useless, as you can see.

552
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:19,311
But there's still
Fogg under there.

553
00:25:19,335 --> 00:25:21,686
You know, it's like
hardwood under shag.

554
00:25:21,763 --> 00:25:23,106
- Well, how do we
get rid of the shag?

555
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:25,334
I'm not doing this, okay?

556
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:27,400
This is banned in 14 countries.

557
00:25:31,388 --> 00:25:33,406
Okay.

558
00:25:34,892 --> 00:25:36,942
The cat will hold all his crazy,

559
00:25:36,977 --> 00:25:39,014
but only while he's touching it.

560
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:40,850
- What happens to the cat?

561
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:43,824
- It goes, well...

562
00:25:43,901 --> 00:25:45,117
crazy.

563
00:25:45,152 --> 00:25:46,827
Don't tell PETA.

564
00:25:46,904 --> 00:25:48,713
All right.
We ready?

565
00:26:01,085 --> 00:26:04,637
Hey.
Thank you, Professor

566
00:26:04,713 --> 00:26:07,042
- The cat looks normal.

567
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:08,235
Trust me.

568
00:26:08,259 --> 00:26:10,142
This cat's having a shit day.

569
00:26:10,177 --> 00:26:11,068
- But I managed to get everyone

570
00:26:11,145 --> 00:26:13,048
out of the Neitherlands in time.

571
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:15,981
Plum may not know, but, yes,

572
00:26:16,016 --> 00:26:17,887
they are going to be attacked.

573
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:19,871
- Well, it seems you did
manage in your way.

574
00:26:19,895 --> 00:26:20,647
- Good.

575
00:26:20,671 --> 00:26:23,989
Tell Kady the Seed
is in the lab.

576
00:26:24,024 --> 00:26:25,324
- Why did you attack Julia?

577
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:28,369
- Because she
and your child would die

578
00:26:28,445 --> 00:26:30,755
if Eleanor had performed
the goddamn surgery.

579
00:26:30,832 --> 00:26:31,975
- Yeah, well,
she's dying now, so...

580
00:26:31,999 --> 00:26:36,043
- If you had succeeded in
delicately separating the cord,

581
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,504
it would be rendered useless.

582
00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:39,839
Quick, rough cut...

583
00:26:39,874 --> 00:26:42,842
Counterintuitive, yes, I know.

584
00:26:42,877 --> 00:26:44,385
The cord goes
into a state of shock.

585
00:26:45,379 --> 00:26:47,440
Allowing it a chance
for implantation.

586
00:26:47,464 --> 00:26:49,056
- Yes.
- Shit.

587
00:26:49,133 --> 00:26:51,058
- This will let Julia recover.

588
00:26:51,135 --> 00:26:52,893
Last time
you realized far too late.

589
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:54,353
The only catch is

590
00:26:54,388 --> 00:26:55,925
you need to attach it
to someone else,

591
00:26:55,949 --> 00:26:58,524
someone who can handle
the physic input from, well...

592
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,495
a clearly very powerful
traveler baby.

593
00:27:06,984 --> 00:27:10,253
- It looks still alive...
for now.

594
00:27:11,539 --> 00:27:14,039
- The Circumstances
control panel is gone,

595
00:27:14,074 --> 00:27:16,542
and the Moon
is not gonna make this easy.

596
00:27:16,577 --> 00:27:19,097
- So choice is, do it here
where the casting's jacked

597
00:27:19,121 --> 00:27:19,971
or let it die?

598
00:27:20,047 --> 00:27:23,090
If we do it here,
who knows what it'll make?

599
00:27:23,167 --> 00:27:25,562
- I think the people of Fillory
deserve a place to go,

600
00:27:25,586 --> 00:27:27,928
even if it doesn't end up
as Fillory.

601
00:27:28,005 --> 00:27:29,555
- Okay.
I'll get started.

602
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,293
- What about Eliot, Margo,
and Josh?

603
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:32,903
We still haven't heard
from them.

604
00:27:32,927 --> 00:27:34,037
Do you think
they've been able to...

605
00:27:34,061 --> 00:27:37,563
- Let's just hope they're
having more luck than we are.

606
00:27:37,598 --> 00:27:40,825
<i>- The slide to the Clock Dwarf
is at the end of the hall.</i>

607
00:27:40,902 --> 00:27:42,996
It takes ten minutes
just to slide down

608
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,080
and even longer to get back up.

609
00:27:44,104 --> 00:27:46,447
- Sorry, I was really stoned
the last time I did this.

610
00:27:46,523 --> 00:27:47,918
Time to discuss
your shortcut, Margo.

611
00:27:47,942 --> 00:27:49,742
- Yeah.
There isn't one.

612
00:27:51,245 --> 00:27:53,120
What do you want me to say?

613
00:27:53,197 --> 00:27:55,008
Somebody had to egg up
and do this,

614
00:27:55,032 --> 00:27:56,059
and I am Margo the Destroyer.

615
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:57,928
- I didn't name you that
just so you...

616
00:27:57,952 --> 00:27:59,012
- Get destroyed
while destroying?

617
00:27:59,036 --> 00:28:02,087
Both: Yeah.
- I'm not wild about it either.

618
00:28:02,122 --> 00:28:05,494
But... this thing's got to
get done, so...

619
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:07,187
- We'll all go.
- Yes, we'll all go.

620
00:28:07,211 --> 00:28:08,211
- Stop.

621
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:11,166
You know, if I learned
one thing from Quentin...

622
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,265
one...

623
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:17,194
it's that sometimes you
sacrifice for those you love.

624
00:28:17,271 --> 00:28:19,980
I'm doing this
so you two can live,

625
00:28:20,057 --> 00:28:21,908
so don't you dare follow me.

626
00:28:26,063 --> 00:28:29,114
- In case the Clock Dwarf
wasn't raptured, a bribe,

627
00:28:29,149 --> 00:28:30,324
- A ham sandwich?

628
00:28:30,401 --> 00:28:31,149
- A ham sandwich.

629
00:28:31,227 --> 00:28:34,189
That is culatello,
capicola, speck,

630
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:35,153
a bit of Jamón Ibérico,

631
00:28:35,231 --> 00:28:37,133
shaved black truffle
from the Microplane.

632
00:28:37,157 --> 00:28:40,000
That is the best goddamn
ham sandwich ever made.

633
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,310
This way I'll know
you guys are safe.

634
00:28:58,345 --> 00:29:00,813
I'll wait until you get
through the tree to do it.

635
00:29:00,889 --> 00:29:01,908
- Bambi, wait!

636
00:29:03,517 --> 00:29:05,025
- Come on.

637
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:16,212
- Penny?

638
00:29:18,282 --> 00:29:20,666
- Hey.
You're... you're, um...

639
00:29:20,701 --> 00:29:22,334
You're up.
How are you...

640
00:29:22,369 --> 00:29:23,502
How are you feeling?

641
00:29:23,537 --> 00:29:27,076
Decent, considering.

642
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,001
Where's baby?

643
00:29:28,025 --> 00:29:31,218
Lipson took her
to get changed.

644
00:29:31,295 --> 00:29:32,915
- How come I can't hear her?

645
00:29:32,939 --> 00:29:35,222
- Up here?

646
00:29:35,299 --> 00:29:36,348
You're fixed.

647
00:29:36,425 --> 00:29:38,058
- How?

648
00:29:38,135 --> 00:29:41,946
- Here she is, baby Eleanor.

649
00:29:42,023 --> 00:29:44,034
- I don't remember
naming her Eleanor.

650
00:29:44,058 --> 00:29:45,201
- Yeah, it's 'cause we didn't.

651
00:29:45,225 --> 00:29:47,693
- People name their kid after
their doctor all the time.

652
00:29:47,728 --> 00:29:49,706
It's a thing that happens.
- Sure.

653
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:52,239
All right, Eleanor.

654
00:30:01,492 --> 00:30:05,252
- I think she...
She may have just pooped.

655
00:30:05,329 --> 00:30:07,616
Hey, I got this.

656
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,141
I've been practicing.

657
00:30:10,217 --> 00:30:11,583
I'm ready.

658
00:30:15,506 --> 00:30:17,598
Hope...

659
00:30:17,674 --> 00:30:19,600
I like that.

660
00:30:19,676 --> 00:30:23,103
- I never said that.
I thought it and...

661
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:26,065
- Yes, I can...

662
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,971
live with Quentin
as her middle name.

663
00:30:28,995 --> 00:30:32,071
- Good.
Again, what the hell?

664
00:30:32,106 --> 00:30:33,739
- Side effect.

665
00:30:33,774 --> 00:30:36,075
We had to attach
the cord to Penny,

666
00:30:36,151 --> 00:30:38,285
and when we did, you got better.

667
00:30:38,362 --> 00:30:40,590
- Wait, so you got your...
You're psychic again?

668
00:30:40,614 --> 00:30:43,123
- Only when I'm holding her.

669
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,395
- What else can you do
while holding her?

670
00:30:58,465 --> 00:31:00,232
Hello?

671
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:04,269
Hello?

672
00:31:04,304 --> 00:31:06,197
Anybody there?

673
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:10,179
Of course not.

674
00:31:10,203 --> 00:31:14,113
"Do not turn backward,
or Fillory will be destroyed.

675
00:31:14,148 --> 00:31:15,706
Management."

676
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:19,660
Guess he got raptured.

677
00:31:19,736 --> 00:31:22,329
Okay, boys.

678
00:31:22,406 --> 00:31:24,551
Show me you were able
to make it out of here.

679
00:31:24,575 --> 00:31:25,716
- Hey, Margo.

680
00:31:25,793 --> 00:31:27,793
In case you can read lips,

681
00:31:27,828 --> 00:31:30,671
I just want to say,
you're the love of my life.

682
00:31:30,747 --> 00:31:32,723
I know.
Duh.

683
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,267
Anyway, um, we're here.

684
00:31:38,338 --> 00:31:40,681
- Okay, we are
officially at zero,

685
00:31:40,757 --> 00:31:42,691
which means...

686
00:31:44,845 --> 00:31:47,071
She looks very pregnant.

687
00:31:47,148 --> 00:31:48,291
- Actually, the male seahorse

688
00:31:48,315 --> 00:31:51,316
carries the young
and gives birth.

689
00:31:51,351 --> 00:31:53,527
Margo would have dug that.
- Yeah.

690
00:31:59,193 --> 00:32:01,396
Are we really doing this?

691
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,538
I don't think I can do this.

692
00:32:04,615 --> 00:32:05,756
- We'll do this together.

693
00:32:07,618 --> 00:32:10,502
Okay.

694
00:32:10,537 --> 00:32:12,741
Here we go, Bambi.

695
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:15,007
- Bye.

696
00:32:28,222 --> 00:32:35,068
<i>- # One last good-bye #</i>

697
00:32:35,145 --> 00:32:42,075
<i># Fade away into the night #</i>

698
00:32:44,655 --> 00:32:51,468
<i># One last good-bye #</i>

699
00:32:51,545 --> 00:32:55,589

<i># Fade away into... #</i>

703
00:33:27,155 --> 00:33:28,650
- She's not coming back.

704
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:30,457
- You don't know that.

705
00:33:31,868 --> 00:33:35,629
<i>- # One last good-bye #</i>

706
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:40,662

707
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:42,427
- What is this?

708
00:33:42,504 --> 00:33:45,430
<i>- # One more time #</i>

709
00:33:45,465 --> 00:33:47,669
- They ended Fillory.

710
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:52,145
- Well, that hardly
seems sporting!

711
00:34:01,898 --> 00:34:03,949
Aah!

712
00:34:14,911 --> 00:34:18,171
- Come with me
if you want to live!

713
00:34:18,248 --> 00:34:19,131
- Penny?

714
00:34:19,166 --> 00:34:21,394
- Yeah, sorry!
Josh wanted me to say it!

715
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:22,562
It seemed real important to him!

716
00:34:22,586 --> 00:34:23,688
Come on!

717
00:34:30,311 --> 00:34:33,854
<i>- # Say, say #</i>

718
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:43,822
- I've never cast magic before.

719
00:34:43,857 --> 00:34:45,657
- You're not casting now, Fen.

720
00:34:45,692 --> 00:34:47,587
- Just... I'm just happy
to be included.

721
00:34:47,611 --> 00:34:49,306
I feel all tingly.

722
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:51,538
Is that what
casting magic feels like?

723
00:34:51,615 --> 00:34:53,332
- Too late to swap
her out for Kady?

724
00:34:53,367 --> 00:34:54,274
- Don't be mean.

725
00:34:54,351 --> 00:34:56,679
- Look, I haven't spent time
in Fillory.

726
00:34:56,703 --> 00:34:58,503
Unless you want your new world

727
00:34:58,538 --> 00:35:00,016
looking like
the Lower East Side?

728
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:01,392
Then...

729
00:35:01,416 --> 00:35:02,716
- I could try.

730
00:35:02,793 --> 00:35:04,885
- Lipson said it's too soon.

731
00:35:04,961 --> 00:35:06,386
Permanent damage.

732
00:35:06,463 --> 00:35:08,250
- I just want to help.

733
00:35:08,274 --> 00:35:10,682
The Moon is cranky.

734
00:35:10,717 --> 00:35:14,611
Zelda's gone, and Alice
is down a hand, so...

735
00:35:15,631 --> 00:35:19,900
- Um, I know something
that might help.

736
00:35:19,976 --> 00:35:21,763
- You cracked the code
on Moon circumstances?

737
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:22,955
- Nope.

738
00:35:22,979 --> 00:35:25,739
- Then what the hell
is your plan?

739
00:35:25,816 --> 00:35:28,533
- My plan is I'm going to accept

740
00:35:28,568 --> 00:35:31,703
exactly everything
I am right now.

741
00:35:31,738 --> 00:35:34,873
- Instagram that nonsense
later, girl. I mean...

742
00:35:34,908 --> 00:35:37,387
- Every single good
and shitty part

743
00:35:37,411 --> 00:35:40,045
and especially the shit.

744
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,881
I suggest we all do it.

745
00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:44,591
We have to acknowledge it

746
00:35:44,668 --> 00:35:48,220
in order to adjust for it
in your casting.

747
00:35:48,255 --> 00:35:50,597
Internal circumstances...

748
00:35:50,674 --> 00:35:53,234
It's the one thing
we can control.

749
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:59,490
One hand is plenty.

750
00:36:01,852 --> 00:36:03,568
I'm ready.

751
00:36:03,603 --> 00:36:06,780
Are you ready?

752
00:36:06,857 --> 00:36:10,075
Hold Fillory
in your minds, okay?

753
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,953
- Too late to pee?

754
00:36:13,029 --> 00:36:14,788
You know what?
It's... it's fine.

755
00:36:14,865 --> 00:36:16,915
It's fine.
Sorry.

756
00:36:43,536 --> 00:36:45,986
It's ready, Fen.

757
00:36:54,488 --> 00:36:57,122
- Do I just...
- Talk to it.

758
00:36:57,157 --> 00:36:58,665
Your memories.

759
00:36:58,742 --> 00:37:01,960
- Um, okay.
Okay.

760
00:37:01,995 --> 00:37:06,034
I remember
the... the Silver Banks

761
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:07,632
and Chatwin's Torrent

762
00:37:07,667 --> 00:37:11,470
and...
the Chankly Bore?

763
00:37:11,505 --> 00:37:14,543
That was weird.

764
00:37:14,567 --> 00:37:18,518
There's Broken Bay

765
00:37:18,595 --> 00:37:20,520
and...

766
00:37:20,597 --> 00:37:23,482
- Nothing's happening.
- What the fuck, Fen?

767
00:37:23,517 --> 00:37:25,650
- You can't just describe it.

768
00:37:25,685 --> 00:37:27,997
You need to give it
your memories.

769
00:37:28,021 --> 00:37:30,873
Okay.

770
00:37:32,585 --> 00:37:34,376
My Fillory...

771
00:37:38,424 --> 00:37:40,665
I remember...

772
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,572
the first time...

773
00:37:43,596 --> 00:37:46,074
I saw a Pegasus.

774
00:37:46,098 --> 00:37:47,931
I was ten.

775
00:37:49,876 --> 00:37:51,885
Only in Fillory.

776
00:37:51,962 --> 00:37:56,084
I remember the first time...

777
00:37:56,108 --> 00:37:58,892
I saw my dad use magic

778
00:37:58,969 --> 00:38:00,589
to make a knife.

779
00:38:00,613 --> 00:38:04,523
And then he wouldn't show me
'cause I'm a girl.

780
00:38:04,558 --> 00:38:05,927
I remember

781
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:08,193
my dad gave me away
to a stranger.

782
00:38:08,228 --> 00:38:10,904
And that's where I realized

783
00:38:10,981 --> 00:38:13,698
Fillory kind of sucks sometimes.

784
00:38:13,733 --> 00:38:14,908
- What are you doing?

785
00:38:14,985 --> 00:38:16,701
- I'm talking about my Fillory.

786
00:38:16,736 --> 00:38:20,705
That place could be,
backwards as shit.

787
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:23,041
And I'm thinking I don't want

788
00:38:23,076 --> 00:38:24,876
to replicate that.

789
00:38:24,911 --> 00:38:27,212
- We kind of need
a wellspring, so...

790
00:38:27,247 --> 00:38:29,848
Right.

791
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:37,764
Can't I just...

792
00:38:37,841 --> 00:38:39,891
have the best of Fillory?

793
00:38:39,926 --> 00:38:43,028
The best of us, of Earth.

794
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:48,108
Plus the best of those cool
movies Todd and I watched.

795
00:38:48,184 --> 00:38:50,994
That's the home I want.

796
00:38:52,772 --> 00:38:55,615
That's what we deserve.

797
00:38:58,612 --> 00:39:00,620
- It's happening.
It's happening!

798
00:39:00,697 --> 00:39:01,966
Keep going!
Keep going!

799
00:39:23,053 --> 00:39:24,947
- Where'd they go?
- I don't know.

800
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,616
- Well, how's it feel?

801
00:39:37,651 --> 00:39:40,285
- Like I'm holding
a goddamn crazy cat

802
00:39:40,362 --> 00:39:44,289
and the fur is ruining
my custom suits.

803
00:39:44,366 --> 00:39:47,626
- No wonder all those Bond
villains were always so pissy.

804
00:39:47,661 --> 00:39:48,661
Bright side...

805
00:39:48,737 --> 00:39:50,699
You can actually complain
while you're holding it.

806
00:39:50,723 --> 00:39:52,631
What a joy.

807
00:39:52,666 --> 00:39:54,299
- And magic hasn't vanished.

808
00:39:54,376 --> 00:39:56,059
There's that.

809
00:39:56,136 --> 00:39:58,729
The Moon's more wonked
than ever, of course.

810
00:39:58,805 --> 00:40:00,513
- Why should anything be easy?

811
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:03,567
Maybe we should take a cue
from the Hedge Witches.

812
00:40:03,644 --> 00:40:05,143
<i>Safehouses are starting to keep</i>

813
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,312
<i>a moon-brained lunatic
on retainer.</i>

814
00:40:07,389 --> 00:40:09,481
- So can we count
on circumstances holding

815
00:40:09,516 --> 00:40:10,690
through tonight or...?

816
00:40:10,767 --> 00:40:12,053
- Yeah, I'd move fast, though.

817
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:15,820
- That we can do.
Right, boss?

818
00:40:15,897 --> 00:40:16,999
<i>- Speaking of adjustments,</i>

819
00:40:17,023 --> 00:40:19,916
<i>how's the newest member
of our faculty holding up?</i>

820
00:40:19,993 --> 00:40:20,934
<i>- His hands are healed.</i>

821
00:40:21,011 --> 00:40:22,755
<i>He just has
to get used to the fact</i>

822
00:40:22,779 --> 00:40:24,090
<i>that half of his friends
are gone.</i>

823
00:40:24,114 --> 00:40:27,332
- Charlton, in Hymanesque form.

824
00:40:27,409 --> 00:40:29,929
- Here you are
in your happy place, but...

825
00:40:29,953 --> 00:40:31,836
you don't seem happy.

826
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,245
- I thought being here
and teaching

827
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:40,720
would help, but...

828
00:40:40,797 --> 00:40:41,605
it hasn't.

829
00:40:41,682 --> 00:40:43,752
<i>- # For the rest of your life #</i>

830
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:47,227
<i># You're gonna be high #</i>

831
00:40:47,303 --> 00:40:50,855
<i># Come home #</i>

832
00:40:50,932 --> 00:40:52,857
- I...

833
00:40:52,934 --> 00:40:55,568
I miss them.

834
00:40:55,645 --> 00:40:58,363
I feel lost and alone
without them...

835
00:40:58,398 --> 00:41:01,866
Margo, all of them.

836
00:41:01,943 --> 00:41:03,868
I even miss Fillory.

837
00:41:03,903 --> 00:41:05,912
Do you think, um...

838
00:41:07,949 --> 00:41:11,209
There's no way
Seb survived?

839
00:41:11,244 --> 00:41:13,211
<i>- Probably not.</i>

840
00:41:13,288 --> 00:41:15,046
<i>Fillory's gone.</i>

841
00:41:15,123 --> 00:41:17,285
<i>But maybe it's better now.</i>

842
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:21,956
<i>Maybe now he's somewhere
with someone who loves him.</i>

843
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:26,057
You're not alone, you know?

844
00:41:26,134 --> 00:41:27,651
Eliot.

845
00:41:32,825 --> 00:41:34,803
Gods.

846
00:41:34,827 --> 00:41:37,639
I am still not used
to how strong alcohol is.

847
00:41:37,663 --> 00:41:39,999
- Keep drinking.
It'll come.

848
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:45,146
- So I have a surprise for you.

849
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:48,983
- I have had a lot of terrible
surprises of late, Charlton.

850
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:53,343
- I've been getting
help from Pete...

851
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,754
the Hedge Witch who deals
in magical objects?

852
00:41:55,789 --> 00:41:58,423
- Good Lord.
Why?

853
00:41:58,458 --> 00:42:01,426
- He helped me figure this out.

854
00:42:01,503 --> 00:42:03,331
Santa left it for you.

855
00:42:12,305 --> 00:42:14,981
- Charlton.

856
00:42:15,058 --> 00:42:18,346
You look like you.

857
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:20,370
- I also feel like me.

858
00:42:20,447 --> 00:42:24,783
If you touch me
but also inside...

859
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,420
It's nice.

860
00:42:40,208 --> 00:42:42,726
- Well, this is weird.

861
00:42:42,803 --> 00:42:44,135
- Good weird?

862
00:42:44,212 --> 00:42:46,207
- So...
- I have an awkward question.

863
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:47,806
I often ask myself
what you'd say,

864
00:42:47,882 --> 00:42:48,951
and the answer's,
"Of course not.

865
00:42:48,975 --> 00:42:50,861
Don't be stupid, Charlton.
Eliot's isn't the kind of... "

866
00:42:50,885 --> 00:42:52,310
- Charlton.

867
00:42:52,387 --> 00:42:53,945
Ask.

868
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:57,886
- I wonder whether you could
ever be romantically inclined

869
00:42:57,910 --> 00:42:59,818
with some someone like me?

870
00:42:59,894 --> 00:43:02,320
- A thousand-year-old Fillorian

871
00:43:02,355 --> 00:43:04,155
in a pervert ghost's body

872
00:43:04,232 --> 00:43:05,894
wearing
a transfiguration amulet?

873
00:43:05,918 --> 00:43:06,998
- A man who knows you well,

874
00:43:07,026 --> 00:43:09,461
is emotionally available,
and plans to stick around.

875
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:20,305
Well, shit, Charlton.

876
00:43:21,934 --> 00:43:24,935
Are we going somewhere?

877
00:43:25,011 --> 00:43:27,916
- Upstairs to explore
this further.

878
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:29,523
- Fuck.

879
00:44:07,479 --> 00:44:11,189
- And what of the efforts
to find our missing students?

880
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:18,062
- Eliot send those?
- Hey.

881
00:44:18,139 --> 00:44:19,564
Where should we start?

882
00:44:19,641 --> 00:44:22,409
- I guess at the top.

883
00:44:25,313 --> 00:44:27,572
- I'm sorry there's
always another quest.

884
00:44:27,649 --> 00:44:31,312
- I know you wanted to just...
- Make a home.

885
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:32,336
Yeah.

886
00:44:32,412 --> 00:44:33,572
- Yeah.

887
00:44:33,596 --> 00:44:38,341
And this is a batshit way
to do it, but it is a way.

888
00:44:38,418 --> 00:44:41,344
Plus, someone's got to
find those idiots.

889
00:44:41,421 --> 00:44:44,589
- Shit's never what we think
it's gonna be.

890
00:44:44,666 --> 00:44:46,494
- Very occasionally it's better.

891
00:44:48,929 --> 00:44:50,261
Right, HQ?

892
00:44:50,338 --> 00:44:51,649
Right?
Yeah.

893
00:44:51,673 --> 00:44:54,168
- HQ?
- Yeah.

894
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:56,170
Here, just hold my hand.

895
00:44:58,271 --> 00:45:00,508
- Where do you think they are?

896
00:45:00,532 --> 00:45:02,941
- Maybe they got sucked
into the World Seed

897
00:45:03,017 --> 00:45:06,347
because it needed matter
to turn into a new world.

898
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:08,131
Maybe it didn't work,
and they got vaporized.

899
00:45:08,189 --> 00:45:10,615
- And yet...

900
00:45:10,692 --> 00:45:12,584
we still have magic.

901
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:18,548
Somewhere a wellspring exists.

902
00:45:18,625 --> 00:45:20,667
- Yeah.

903
00:45:34,549 --> 00:45:36,193
Look what I found.

904
00:45:36,217 --> 00:45:37,903
Turns out this place
has knife trees.

905
00:45:37,927 --> 00:45:38,971
- I mean, if Josh could find

906
00:45:38,995 --> 00:45:41,549
naturally occurring
pizza ovens, then why not?

907
00:45:41,573 --> 00:45:43,073
- Hey, guys.

908
00:45:43,149 --> 00:45:45,241
Found a margherita here,

909
00:45:45,318 --> 00:45:48,486
if anyone is hungry.

910
00:45:48,563 --> 00:45:51,081
This definitely isn't Fillory.

911
00:45:51,157 --> 00:45:53,544
- Yeah, but it's not
not Fillory.

912
00:45:53,568 --> 00:45:55,212
Kind of smells the same, right?

913
00:45:55,236 --> 00:45:58,997
- The opium made it.
That's a plus.

914
00:45:59,073 --> 00:46:02,070
- I passed a field
of bacon... crispy.

915
00:46:02,094 --> 00:46:05,406
- Is that a Fillory thing?
- More of a me thing.

916
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:08,172
- Well, the air is breathable,

917
00:46:08,249 --> 00:46:09,599
food galore,

918
00:46:09,676 --> 00:46:12,343
no predators in the vicinity.

919
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:14,938
Is it time?

920
00:46:15,015 --> 00:46:16,180
No?

921
00:46:16,215 --> 00:46:17,048
- If we let them out,

922
00:46:17,125 --> 00:46:18,942
we have to tell them
we're utterly lost.

923
00:46:19,019 --> 00:46:21,422
No idea where we are
and not a bunny in sight

924
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:22,999
to get a message to our friends.

925
00:46:23,023 --> 00:46:25,189
- And they'll be
homesick and scared

926
00:46:25,266 --> 00:46:27,358
and cranky and hungry.

927
00:46:27,435 --> 00:46:31,195
- We'll have to build
infrastructure from scratch.

928
00:46:31,272 --> 00:46:32,497
- So...

929
00:46:34,442 --> 00:46:36,626
Who wants to do the honors?

930
00:46:36,703 --> 00:46:39,607
- You carried the whole world
in your cooch.

931
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:40,716
You earned it.

932
00:46:42,709 --> 00:46:44,612
Thanks for saying that.

933
00:46:44,636 --> 00:46:47,712
But New Fillory needs a leader.

934
00:46:47,789 --> 00:46:49,380
And...

935
00:46:49,457 --> 00:46:53,121
as its literal birth mother...

936
00:46:53,145 --> 00:46:55,428
I feel I get to say...

937
00:46:55,505 --> 00:46:58,126
I hereby dub thee

938
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:01,059
High King Margo, the Creator.

939
00:47:01,094 --> 00:47:02,435
- Whoo!

940
00:47:04,847 --> 00:47:07,468
- Fine.
Make a meal out of it.

941
00:47:07,492 --> 00:47:09,912
You guys know our lives
are about to get even weirder

942
00:47:09,936 --> 00:47:12,640
in some insane way
we can't possibly predict?

943
00:47:12,664 --> 00:47:14,308
- I mean, yes.
- Yes.

944
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:16,166
- I mean, yes.
- Yes.

945
00:47:16,242 --> 00:47:18,743
- I find that somehow...

946
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:20,411
perversely comforting.

947
00:47:20,488 --> 00:47:23,247
- So do I.

948
00:47:23,324 --> 00:47:26,793
That's how I know
it's our story.
