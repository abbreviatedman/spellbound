1
00:00:01,335 --> 00:00:02,775
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:13,278
Your new lady Centurion!

3
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:20,719
You said you heard
voices from other worlds.

4
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,547
You hearing something? A signal?

5
00:00:27,461 --> 00:00:30,158
Professor? Did the
signal make you do that?

6
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,899
<i>He loved you.</i>

7
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,213
Why would I want to take
that away from you now?

8
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:38,603
That would be so cruel.

9
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:42,394
Do you really think I didn't
know there was more?

10
00:00:44,077 --> 00:00:45,670
<i>What was I supposed to do, huh?</i>

11
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:49,306
Demand that he only love me?

12
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,545
"Dark King" is a little generic

13
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:52,950
as villain names go. Mmm.

14
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,681
Wouldn't you say? I have notes.

15
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:56,519
Although he is
somewhat effective.

16
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,183
Everyone seems terrified of him.

17
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:00,250
Eliot, Taker! Back up.

18
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,535
You all right?

19
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:15,339
Death is so simple and
life is so complicated.

20
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:18,103
I know.

21
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:22,774
I think I almost
fucked the Dark King.

22
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:25,176
Are you familiar with the
Harmonic Convergence?

23
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:28,279
A rare and powerful
astrological occurrence.

24
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:29,720
A magnifier of magic.

25
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,883
How bad will it be?

26
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:33,291
Death toll in the millions.
Maybe much higher.

27
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:35,259
How can we stop it? You can't.

28
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:36,955
<i>I repeat, ward break.</i>

29
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:42,568
<i>Hedge witches.</i>

30
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:44,798
<i>They're used to crumbs
and, yes, ambient is low.</i>

31
00:01:44,905 --> 00:01:46,082
<i>But you know what amplifies it?</i>

32
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,301
<i>Cooperative magic.</i>

33
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:48,739
<i>We tell everyone,</i>

34
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:51,904
and we all do the same
thing at the same time.

35
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,717
<i>And I thought that if I took on
more power and more responsibility,</i>

36
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,553
<i>that I'd want heroin less.</i>

37
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,283
<i>When I thought I'd relapsed,</i>

38
00:02:03,156 --> 00:02:04,488
I was relieved.

39
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:12,931
So, uh, I've been
clean for a year.

40
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:15,401
Barely.

41
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:18,029
Thanks, but, uh, maybe hold that

42
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:22,140
'cause I've been jonesing hard.

43
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,448
Well, uh, I'm a Hedge.

44
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:32,942
You know, before we helped
save magic, we got a shit deal, right?

45
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,182
Well, there was a
blood worm scare,

46
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:37,328
so the Library gave a lot
of Hedges the Reed's Mark.

47
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:41,352
Get a mark, you're magically
castrated until they take it off.

48
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:43,506
And the Library's
imploding, they can't fix it,

49
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,432
and the marked ones
are looking at me like,

50
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,062
"Hey, bossy pants, you rallied us to
save magic, how about saving us?"

51
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,835
And I found a spell to remove
the marks in a depository,

52
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:57,477
Only, all of a
sudden, it's gone.

53
00:02:57,544 --> 00:03:01,811
But I know only way to
move something that warded

54
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:03,783
is to move it through
the Etheric Realm.

55
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,211
Cool. I've heard it's awesome
there. What's the prob?

56
00:03:07,988 --> 00:03:09,354
The prob

57
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,054
is there's only one
way into the Realm.

58
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:17,194
Anybody heard of "RCH"?

59
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:20,165
Nickname, "Archie"?

60
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:24,999
Yup.

61
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:29,810
The way to save every
marked Hedge is to drop acid.

62
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:33,747
True 12-step conundrum.

63
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,673
I'm assuming you
have the Archie on you?

64
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:45,185
Call your sponsor, kid.

65
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,720
It'd make sense,

66
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:52,691
in case somebody here, you know,
gave you permission to jump off the wagon.

67
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:54,729
Sorry MA is so strict.

68
00:03:54,835 --> 00:03:56,235
You met the nice me.

69
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,033
Here's the real me.

70
00:03:58,205 --> 00:03:59,298
Fuck off.

71
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:05,571
What?

72
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:14,521
Well, I take the "anonymous" part of
Magicians Anonymous very seriously.

73
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:16,847
So, you quit drinking?

74
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,119
Thirty-three days,
six hours, 19 minutes

75
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:22,719
of skin-peeling,
soul-searing hell ago, yes.

76
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,498
Well, I can relate. As can I,

77
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:29,095
in regards to the crushing
weight of leadership.

78
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:33,931
I've never seen Archie.

79
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:36,810
May I?

80
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:41,781
Why two?

81
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,112
In case the first trip's a bust.

82
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,716
Or in case it's fun.

83
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,753
I've been dismissive or
downright derisive about Hedges,

84
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:56,160
and I admit, I was quite wrong,

85
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,632
and I'd like to try
and make, um...

86
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:00,627
Hell, what's the word?

87
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,002
Amends. Yeah.

88
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:10,376
Are you crazy?

89
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:12,678
I am.

90
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,941
But I am not an addict.

91
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:17,484
I'm an alcoholic.
Totally different.

92
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:21,151
So, I will go hunt
down the depository.

93
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,858
You're not going alone.

94
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:41,297
So we know about the
Harmonic Convergence.

95
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,366
The problem is we know
just enough to be useless,

96
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:46,344
so maybe we find someone
who can see the big picture.

97
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,373
Find? Summon.

98
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:51,811
A god?

99
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:55,131
Whoa, you've got
to be kidding me.

100
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:58,353
Wait. Julia, before you do that,
I think the Library might have...

101
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,585
Penny? I'm fine.

102
00:06:02,896 --> 00:06:05,229
Wow, that is a whole
other level. Jesus.

103
00:06:05,332 --> 00:06:06,823
I thought the patch was working.

104
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,711
Merritt's signal just
keeps getting stronger.

105
00:06:08,735 --> 00:06:12,729
I'm sorry. I can't stay. I'm just no
use until I get this under control.

106
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,740
Maybe do the summoning
once I get back?

107
00:06:15,609 --> 00:06:17,043
Let me know if
things get too weird.

108
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:18,805
Yeah. Same.

109
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:29,681
The Library has summoned me
about 7,000 times to come work there.

110
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,622
And they also gave me this.

111
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,261
It'll get me in any time I want.

112
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,273
Look, I'll bring back
whatever they have

113
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:39,061
on the Harmonic
Convergence as fast as I can.

114
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,069
Are you sure you'll
be okay? Yeah.

115
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,235
Good luck. You, too.

116
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:50,169
Makes sense the
signal's hitting you harder.

117
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,572
I'm starting to actually
hear... A voice?

118
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:55,205
You, too? Kind of.

119
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,884
I can't make out actual words.

120
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:59,262
At least, not ones
I can understand.

121
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:01,278
Is that for me? - No.

122
00:07:01,388 --> 00:07:05,120
I think the problem with the first
patch was that it was just a deflector.

123
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:09,261
The signal is getting bounced off,
but I'm still getting hit by the reverb.

124
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:12,663
This one should absorb
the sound and kill it.

125
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,201
And if it does, we'll see
what we can gin up for you.

126
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:32,276
Okay. Mmm.

127
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:34,517
Better, I think.

128
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,455
Uh...

129
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:39,854
Okay.

130
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:46,962
What was that?

131
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,433
Where did you go?
I don't remember.

132
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,870
You didn't blip out on purpose?

133
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:56,171
No, when the pain got so I was
gonna pass out, I just... I just went.

134
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:57,835
You need a doctor.

135
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,079
I'm impressed.

136
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,882
Not with this. It's
dreadful. Sorry.

137
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:15,495
With your skills as a
Magician. Who trained you?

138
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:18,096
Well, I just picked up a
little bit here and there.

139
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:21,859
Clearly not enough, since I
couldn't put a scratch on that Taker.

140
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,295
Don't be modest.

141
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,030
You have what it takes
to be quite formidable.

142
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:27,539
I could use you.

143
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,474
Official Court Magician in
Defense of the Kingdom.

144
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:33,707
You could teach others,
and be taught by me.

145
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:37,210
I would be honored,

146
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:40,451
Your Majesty.

147
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,458
Hmm.

148
00:08:46,826 --> 00:08:48,590
A different lining, perhaps.

149
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:49,695
Gray, please.

150
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:59,596
When we are
alone, it can be Seb.

151
00:09:00,673 --> 00:09:02,005
Well, Seb,

152
00:09:02,776 --> 00:09:04,540
we have a saying
where I come from.

153
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:07,003
You kinda buried
the lede on the...

154
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,914
On the, well...

155
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,679
On you.

156
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,084
I didn't mean to deceive you.

157
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:18,080
Kings have to be very
careful about who to trust.

158
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:22,321
And also, it can
be a relief to not...

159
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,626
Feel the weight of the crown
on your head every second?

160
00:09:25,432 --> 00:09:26,627
You are wise.

161
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,392
But I knew that already.

162
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:37,204
In any case, settle in,

163
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,906
and we'll get down to the
particulars of your duties later.

164
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:41,571
All right?

165
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:45,184
All right, Your Majesty.

166
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,206
<i>Ugh, please.</i> ELIOT: <i>What?</i>

167
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:56,757
If you say his gorgeous
eyes see into your soul,

168
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,407
I'm gonna puke all
over your new leggings,

169
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,627
which are quite sharp,
by the way. Thank you.

170
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:03,562
Legs for days. Thank you.

171
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:06,902
And I never said his eyes were
gorgeous or that he sees into my soul.

172
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,373
But weirdly, he might.

173
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,377
Or he's sucking the soul out of
you because he doesn't have one.

174
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,605
Um...

175
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:13,941
He did save my life.

176
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,106
He's called the Dark King.

177
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:17,082
You're called
Margo the Destroyer.

178
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:20,245
I was a woman ruling a patriarchy.
My brand had to be overkill.

179
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,980
Bottom line, he likes you.

180
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,921
Use that to find out
what he's really about.

181
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,394
I'll see if my fellow
Centurions like to gossip.

182
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,592
Then we regroup and decide.

183
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,931
Benevolent dictator
by necessity,

184
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:39,266
or psychopathic
despot by choice?

185
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,998
What if he's the latter?
Then I always got his back.

186
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,975
Perfect place to bury these.

187
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,915
Zelda, help me, please.

188
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,320
What's going on? Who are they?

189
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:33,392
Goths.

190
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:35,928
Like Marilyn Manson? Visigoths.

191
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:37,725
Oh, Germanic barbarians.

192
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:40,629
Who always show up at the
absolute worst points in history.

193
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,634
Fucking hell.

194
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:08,025
Oh, sorry. Did you...
Did you want Hades?

195
00:12:08,428 --> 00:12:12,661
I could get word to him,
but, ugh, what a dick.

196
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:14,967
Are you...

197
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,128
I'm Clarion, Goddess of Melody.

198
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:20,536
Hey, Julia. I've, uh, had my
eye on you for quite a while.

199
00:12:20,673 --> 00:12:22,107
You have? Yeah, yeah.

200
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:23,676
So, you were mortal, right?

201
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,921
And then you were one of us, and
now you're back to mortal. Whew.

202
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:28,505
You're one tough
cookie, Cookie. Thanks?

203
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:31,617
Yeah, but the way that you're
imagining the Harmonic Convergence

204
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:34,153
isn't quite enough.

205
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,688
It's so much worse.

206
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,582
So, when all the spells cast by
all of the Magicians go haywire,

207
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:44,426
you're gonna get earthquakes,
fire, drought, starvation, plague.

208
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:46,429
And then comes cannibalism.

209
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:47,558
Um...

210
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:49,068
Is there anything you can do?

211
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,167
I could stop it.

212
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:52,767
How would that be? Great.

213
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:55,569
But I'm assuming there's
something you want in return.

214
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:01,240
Yeah. You, uh...

215
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:03,415
You have dealt
with a god or two.

216
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:06,581
Yep.

217
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,247
I wanna be human.

218
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,617
Like you.

219
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:13,618
Excuse me?

220
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:17,256
I worship you, Julia.

221
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,477
How did you do it, though? Because
that's the part that I couldn't quite see.

222
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,970
There's some kind of cloak
around the whole process.

223
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:28,500
Uh, rumor is it has
something to do with a book.

224
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:31,669
Yeah, okay, I'm gonna
need just a few more details.

225
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,280
I don't know.
Starting with "Why?"

226
00:13:34,347 --> 00:13:37,340
Do I want to be
human? Oh, it's simple.

227
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,749
So, I'm the Goddess
of Melody, right?

228
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:43,118
But did you know that we
can't actually feel music?

229
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:47,752
Like, we understand it, we can
tell the good from the bad. Sort of.

230
00:13:47,927 --> 00:13:51,455
So you want to be human
so you can do karaoke.

231
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:56,367
I know that it sounds
like hubris itself, but...

232
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,536
I think I could be a rock star.

233
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:03,305
I mean, I pretty much know the
gig, right? They all prayed to me.

234
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:07,575
Except for Amy Winehouse, okay?
Look how that one turned out. Poor thing.

235
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,978
Any other questions?

236
00:14:09,716 --> 00:14:10,716
Oh, boy.

237
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:44,346
This is amazing.

238
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:50,589
Careful.

239
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:51,690
Whoa!

240
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:55,357
Real world isn't quite gone.

241
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,370
Oh.

242
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:07,768
This is what my neck feels like.

243
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:15,278
Come on. The
depository. Come on.

244
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,622
Welcome. KADY: H... Hi.

245
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:35,125
Oh.

246
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:39,433
We're looking for a depository
that was, uh... It was over there.

247
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:40,933
Eat up.

248
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:45,239
Yeah, in a sec, but if you
know where the depository is...

249
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,803
Nobody knows where
anything is in the Realm.

250
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:49,041
Except for the Emperor.

251
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:52,142
Dear God. This is strange.

252
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,447
Tastes like, uh...

253
00:15:56,088 --> 00:16:00,492
burning charcoal.
Hamburgers on a grill.

254
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,653
Popsicles.

255
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,896
Is that bunny staring at us?

256
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:14,237
Summer at the beach.

257
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:21,645
Brown bunny,
sunglasses. Beach clue.

258
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,150
I'm trying real
hard to give a shit,

259
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,617
but it just feels so
good to be high again.

260
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:27,710
Mmm. Uh...

261
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:30,322
I guess we follow him.

262
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:33,653
So we all know the
threat we're facing.

263
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,187
These are Fillory's second greatest
protectors against the Takers.

264
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:42,161
Who can tell me the first?
His Majesty, the Dark King.

265
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:45,348
Which is why protecting him is the
most important job in the kingdom.

266
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:50,035
His Majesty is immortal,
yes, but he is not invulnerable.

267
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,474
Which makes us?

268
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,138
Expendable.

269
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:02,450
A group of Royal Map Makers
won't make it back here till after dark.

270
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:06,050
And the first cohort is trapped
in a blizzard on Madness Plains.

271
00:17:06,158 --> 00:17:08,821
You wet-nosed
whelps are all we've got.

272
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:11,524
Well, you, me

273
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,727
and our glorious leader.

274
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,205
What are we looking at here?

275
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:25,711
His Majesty wants the kingdom to witness
him saving subjects from the Takers.

276
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:29,738
These are in almost every room in
the castle, most of the taverns, and...

277
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:40,620
It's fucking Fox News.

278
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,525
Foxes all lie. Who'd
ever believe their news?

279
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:46,065
His Majesty, I'm afraid all we
have are the newest recruits.

280
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,035
- Who'll learn by doing.
- Yes, sir.

281
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:51,432
With me, recruits. Break.

282
00:17:52,605 --> 00:17:53,800
Quick step now.

283
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:55,402
Ready, hup.

284
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:02,372
Give me a phaser
and a red shirt.

285
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,781
What? Yeah, just don't.

286
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,391
The Binder was annoyed.

287
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,835
But unsurprised Julia had
failed to burn him out of existence,

288
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,098
per their agreement.

289
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,900
Look, I just thought maybe
we were both a little hasty,

290
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,706
and, I don't know, maybe I'd keep
you safe, let us both cool down.

291
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:36,608
So can you do it?

292
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:38,742
The Binder stared at Julia,

293
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,585
wondering if she'd learned nothing
from her interactions with deities.

294
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,316
I don't have a lot of
choice here, okay?

295
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:48,587
If you can't do this,
the Earth is doomed.

296
00:18:48,761 --> 00:18:53,597
Mmm. "Again?" the
Binder, asked, bored.

297
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,434
Still, the Binder wondered,

298
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:02,305
why on Earth would
Julia trust this "Clarion"?

299
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:06,138
I don't. But the options
here are narrowing.

300
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:10,640
As a book, the Binder enjoyed
any opportunity to teach.

301
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:15,154
And here was a word Julia
desperately needed to understand.

302
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,785
No.

303
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:24,224
So are these the same Visigoths that
raided cultural strongholds on Earth?

304
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,162
Burned the Library
of Alexandria.

305
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:27,791
Sacked the statuary
of Ancient Greece.

306
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:30,336
Burned Rome,
London, Paris, Chicago,

307
00:19:30,436 --> 00:19:32,667
where they framed
poor Mrs. O'Leary's cow.

308
00:19:32,772 --> 00:19:34,583
That's around the time
they started getting bored

309
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:35,870
and moved into the multiverse.

310
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:37,469
I'm sorry about all of this,

311
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:40,069
but I need every book you have
on the Harmonic Convergence.

312
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,705
We have a vast collection
on the other side of that door.

313
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,078
Oh, wow. Lovely timing.

314
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:54,225
How do you do?

315
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,019
I'm Visigoth Overlord Terence.

316
00:19:57,096 --> 00:20:01,466
Apologies for the mess. But
recall, I did announce our incursion,

317
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:05,198
and asked you most politely to
drop all your defenses and surrender,

318
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:09,733
having given my word that
you would be absolutely safe.

319
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:11,174
Right.

320
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,267
The word of a barbarian?

321
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:15,746
Actually, Visigoths are famous
for always keeping their word.

322
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:17,840
Yeah, that's weird.

323
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:21,112
My dear, if you'd be so kind...

324
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:25,817
Sorry. I'm just a little
confused here, but you seem...

325
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,383
Educated? Polite to a fault?

326
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:31,959
We seek to acquire only
the deepest knowledge,

327
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,727
highest art and most
illuminating philosophy.

328
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,894
Is it any wonder a
little might rub off?

329
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:39,733
What about all those inconvenient
commandments about theft?

330
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,705
Alice, it's no use debating.

331
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:46,074
Alice, is it? That's
lovely. Thank you.

332
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:50,105
We seek only those works that
transcend appetite and avarice,

333
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:51,684
that touch upon the immutable.

334
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:55,285
That's why we spend so
little time on Earth anymore.

335
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:57,051
What's left to raid?

336
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:04,294
Tent-pole franchises? Jeff
Koons? The, um, hoodie?

337
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:08,058
Visigoths never lie, but they
never tell the whole truth either.

338
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:09,727
I know what you're really after.

339
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,283
The books of everyone...
Is actually what they want.

340
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:29,481
Every sentient being's life,
birth to death. Can you imagine?

341
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:32,788
They could plan the pillaging of every
great work before it's painted or written.

342
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:36,486
Not to mention the stock
market. Stock market?

343
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,940
They have a thing about
shorting. They think it's hilarious.

344
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,610
Look, Zelda, I understand how important
this is to you, but what's the point?

345
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,899
They're gonna get in here,
and this is the only door.

346
00:21:45,171 --> 00:21:49,438
Okay. How about this?
You want to teach? Teach.

347
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:52,778
You? To turn a goddess mortal?

348
00:21:53,512 --> 00:21:57,313
The Binder inquired, with
not a small amount of disdain.

349
00:21:57,383 --> 00:21:58,749
Hmm.

350
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,519
Too tough? Fine.

351
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:04,817
Maybe I'll just hand you to her.

352
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:05,924
Ah.

353
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:09,450
The Binder realized Julia had
cornered him with his own credo.

354
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,930
But still, he wondered,
what was in it for him?

355
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,697
How's this, paper boy?

356
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:24,507
Said the Binder, "Let
the lessons commence."

357
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:33,880
Whoa.

358
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:57,399
Socks. None of them match.

359
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:06,743
So, this is where they go.

360
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:13,390
If you see a red and orange argyle,
cashmere, size 13, grab it, please.

361
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,159
I don't usually say
this when I'm this high,

362
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,056
but we really need to focus.

363
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:22,691
Exactly. Red and orange.

364
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:26,705
Jesus. No, no.
We're looking for, uh...

365
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:30,000
Christ. I don't believe it.

366
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:31,538
There it is.

367
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:38,274
You were right.
Just needed to focus.

368
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:41,415
Mmm.

369
00:23:41,487 --> 00:23:42,853
Oh, bunny. Bunny.

370
00:23:50,296 --> 00:23:51,296
Um...

371
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,759
Hi. Uh...

372
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,259
We're looking for an Emperor.

373
00:23:57,736 --> 00:24:01,195
Hey, Kady. Hank.

374
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,902
Hank. I don't hate that.

375
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:05,938
You know us?

376
00:24:07,579 --> 00:24:10,413
What kind of an Emp
would I be if I didn't?

377
00:24:10,516 --> 00:24:13,975
You roll into my town, I take
a gander at your thoughts

378
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:16,214
and if I dig you, I show
you the brown bunny.

379
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:18,981
And I dig you both.

380
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:21,526
Congratulations
on the first sock.

381
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:25,691
How great is Archie,
by the way? Huh?

382
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,427
Pretty great, once
you let it settle in.

383
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:34,337
And as long as you're here,
the high never goes away.

384
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:36,340
Wow.

385
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:38,076
That's, uh...

386
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,338
That's perfect. KADY: Yeah.

387
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:42,540
We... We really
need to find the, uh...

388
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:45,641
Oh, Jesus. The, ugh...

389
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:47,448
Depository, Kady.

390
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:50,956
Right. Right. Uh, can you
tell us where that is now?

391
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:53,515
Sure can. Won't be free, though.

392
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,494
Even here, where
everything's fun, there's a price.

393
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,025
Sit. Have some suds.

394
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,335
This'll take a sec.

395
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:05,636
What will?

396
00:25:06,572 --> 00:25:09,132
For me to dig deeper
into your thoughts,

397
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:12,869
see which one of
you gets to leave

398
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,105
and who has to stay.

399
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,319
Mmm.

400
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:31,081
The Map Makers are in there.

401
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,400
Do you hear that?

402
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,536
Oh, boy.

403
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:42,599
Breathing.

404
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:44,502
Coming from there.

405
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:48,007
With respect, Majesty. There.

406
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:53,342
Guys? There. There.
There. We're surrounded.

407
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:54,519
You can see them?

408
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:56,248
I have really good night vision.

409
00:25:56,355 --> 00:25:59,382
My grandpa married a
snow leopard is the rumor.

410
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:01,018
Sire?

411
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:04,962
Where is he going?

412
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:12,762
Oh, I've seen that before. It's
a legit royal tactic. Never fear.

413
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,407
Shouldn't we get
him to the infirmary?

414
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,637
With all the newbies
practicing during surges,

415
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,179
it's like a meat
locker down there.

416
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,975
And the meat's alive.

417
00:26:23,715 --> 00:26:24,910
Until it's not.

418
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:28,553
Penny?

419
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:33,621
Get Julia. Who?

420
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:53,236
So our Dark King, did
he just shit the doublet?

421
00:26:55,247 --> 00:26:58,706
I hope so. I really don't want to
be the only one who does it when...

422
00:28:00,646 --> 00:28:02,706
That's amazing. Right?

423
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:06,842
I mean, honestly, fuck
Netflix. That is peak television.

424
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,519
Jesus.

425
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:13,856
No kidding. You kicked some
serious ass for your kingdom.

426
00:28:28,574 --> 00:28:29,667
Pretty cool.

427
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:35,280
You're both equally awesome,
by which I mean totally fucked up.

428
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:38,645
By which I mean I get
you're on a mission.

429
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:39,912
One of you has gotta jet,

430
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:43,280
but either one of you
can hang for eternity.

431
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,415
You guys decide.

432
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:48,390
I'll stay. DEAN:
No, you will not.

433
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:50,491
Are you kidding?

434
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:52,591
This place is heroin heaven.

435
00:28:52,698 --> 00:28:56,066
And a billion times better
than Isabella's Islay single malt.

436
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:58,700
Look it up when you
get back. I'm staying.

437
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,830
You've got students
counting on you.

438
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:04,240
And I've had it with the goddamn
lot of them. All 40 timelines' worth.

439
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,888
I never really knew how sick of
them I was until I stopped drinking.

440
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:09,609
I've earned the
right to step off

441
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:11,707
and do tai chi with the Elvi.

442
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:15,947
I want this as much as you.

443
00:29:16,054 --> 00:29:18,080
As soon as he tells you
where the depository is...

444
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:23,589
Sorry, Kady. But you just revealed
to the entire studio audience

445
00:29:23,729 --> 00:29:27,598
that you're hanging on to a
thread of responsible intent.

446
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:32,461
Which could make you kind of
a bum hang in 100 years or so.

447
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:36,138
Hank, on the other hand,

448
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:40,508
is laid-back mondo perfectos.

449
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:44,978
Hey. You don't really want this.

450
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,719
Kady, sweet Kady.

451
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,311
I'm sorry I did this to you.

452
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:52,321
I had no right.

453
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,422
My whole life,

454
00:29:54,626 --> 00:30:00,429
all the senseless
worry, suffering and pain,

455
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:02,297
both inflicted and received...

456
00:30:04,536 --> 00:30:05,936
it wasn't for nothing.

457
00:30:06,772 --> 00:30:07,899
It guided me here.

458
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:11,170
And you were right.

459
00:30:12,444 --> 00:30:13,969
I am home.

460
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:23,546
I'll be back, okay? I promise.

461
00:30:24,523 --> 00:30:26,549
Goody. See you soon.

462
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:45,936
Use your key. Go.

463
00:30:46,545 --> 00:30:48,707
I'm not going
without you. I can't.

464
00:30:48,814 --> 00:30:51,477
Do you really want to
die for a bunch of books?

465
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:55,210
If I could do it all again,

466
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:58,688
I'd be a better mother,

467
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:01,390
a truer friend.

468
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:07,192
But I wasn't. I'm not.

469
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,131
Because I've
given my life to this.

470
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:15,030
It's all I am. It's all I have.

471
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:18,871
I can't lose everything.

472
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:20,972
You can. Believe me, I have.

473
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:25,184
I'm sorry about Quentin.

474
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:29,754
But this is
different. No, it's not.

475
00:31:31,423 --> 00:31:36,054
Because whoever, whatever you
love that gets ripped away from you,

476
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:40,093
it stays alive, inside of us.

477
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:42,557
And anyone you share it with.

478
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,393
I can't. I can't.

479
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,867
I'm not strong enough.

480
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,356
Stopping her
signal is impossible.

481
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,212
It's coming from a
place that I can't reach.

482
00:31:57,716 --> 00:32:00,777
But I could save
him. Then do it. Now.

483
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,300
I'll just need you to give
me what we agreed to.

484
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:05,624
And the rest of
it? Rest of what?

485
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:08,086
The part where
you save the planet.

486
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:11,558
You have one thing to
trade, Julia, for one miracle.

487
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:17,466
So, your miracle can be to
save your boyfriend or your world.

488
00:32:17,803 --> 00:32:19,135
But you could save both.

489
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:24,039
You know what? Humans have exploited
gods since you guys staggered upright.

490
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:26,839
The deals that we
make need to be strict.

491
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,141
So this deal, one
book, one miracle.

492
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:31,579
You're really gonna
make me choose?

493
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:33,579
The planet or him?

494
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:36,280
Yeah. I know. It's
total bullshit, right?

495
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:37,822
You see why I want to be human?

496
00:32:37,923 --> 00:32:41,985
I can't feel the melodies I'm goddess of,
can't bend the rules I didn't make. Eh...

497
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:44,823
Don't put this on your kind.

498
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,822
This is you, choosing.

499
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:49,327
But the one who
has to choose is you.

500
00:32:52,771 --> 00:32:54,433
I'd say he has
about a minute left.

501
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:14,253
I feel

502
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,155
better.

503
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,197
So why do I feel like something
really shitty went down?

504
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:24,795
Maybe because you're here.

505
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:26,532
Like all humans.

506
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,201
23 saw little and knew less.

507
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:31,339
What strange, sad,

508
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:36,281
angry, narrow, little lives
these humans stumbled through.

509
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:39,382
Okay, just tell me what
you did to me. I helped you.

510
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,544
And now, you're
going to help me.

511
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,047
The Binder reminded the goddess

512
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:49,594
he couldn't be forced to
do anything he didn't wish to.

513
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,028
Aw.

514
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:52,663
Honey, I don't force anyone.

515
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:54,560
I just get what I want.

516
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,527
Goodbye, Julia.

517
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:59,161
And for what it's worth, I feel
like you made the right decision.

518
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:01,730
For what it's worth,
go fuck yourself.

519
00:34:11,016 --> 00:34:13,747
That's all of them,
sir. None harmed.

520
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:17,580
We'll secure the site. You should
go back with the Map Makers.

521
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:25,763
Kind of feels a little abrupt.

522
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:28,595
You know? I kinda felt like he was
gearing up to make a big speech,

523
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,032
and it's just...

524
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:32,329
Wait.

525
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:35,063
Back inside. Now.

526
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:37,740
Excuse me, sir, but wasn't
this a rescue mission?

527
00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:41,413
A super-successful
one? That's over?

528
00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:43,108
Inside.

529
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:52,052
So, I... I take it she's
the god you summoned?

530
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:55,523
Who is not going to
save the world for us?

531
00:34:56,061 --> 00:34:57,541
Look, we'll figure
something else out.

532
00:34:57,963 --> 00:34:58,963
We've got time.

533
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:00,998
There's more, isn't there?

534
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,298
Anyone else need a drink?

535
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:11,799
Look, the signal was killing you. I
did what needed to be done now.

536
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:15,370
But she didn't have time
to be delicate. She just...

537
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,141
She said that the
only way was...

538
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,116
Take away my psychic abilities.

539
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:25,780
Yeah, 'cause

540
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:30,759
I'm not getting
Merritt's signal anymore.

541
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:36,200
Or anybody's thoughts here

542
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,293
or anywhere.

543
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,306
So this is quiet.

544
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:48,576
It is fucking weird.

545
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,942
You can't travel anymore.

546
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:52,948
Technically, I can.

547
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:55,680
It'd just be like
flying a jet blind.

548
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:58,319
And since I'm not suicidal, I...

549
00:35:58,423 --> 00:35:59,618
I'm sorry, Penny.

550
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:02,786
No. We just settled a really
big spiritual argument here.

551
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:06,196
There is for sure instant karma.

552
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,228
If there had been
more time... Come on.

553
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:14,033
You can appreciate the
balance of it, the irony.

554
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,136
I had to make a choice for you,

555
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,469
you had to make a choice for me.

556
00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:24,613
It is fucking radiant.

557
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:26,676
Um...

558
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:30,688
This...

559
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:36,728
So, uh, this happened...

560
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:40,657
This is because of me.

561
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:44,931
I didn't see it coming and I never
thought it was gonna get this bad.

562
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,402
Merritt, what could
you have done?

563
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,234
I should've told you the truth.

564
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:52,235
My name, my real name, is Plum.

565
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:57,815
Plum Merritt Chatwin.

566
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:01,884
Wait. What? You're a Chatwin?

567
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:03,713
Wait. What do you mean?
Like the kids' books?

568
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:05,414
I missed an episode.

569
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,415
I am so sorry.

570
00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:10,961
I was terrified and alone,

571
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:15,690
and being here was
the first time I felt safe.

572
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:17,595
But I'm not.

573
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:21,296
The thing with being a
Chatwin is, it's like a curse.

574
00:37:21,506 --> 00:37:24,704
It's like there are things coming
after you you just don't understand.

575
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:28,235
I don't know what this signal is,
but I know why it's targeting me.

576
00:37:28,313 --> 00:37:31,147
And I'm gonna figure out how
to fix it. Whoa! Hang on. Hang on.

577
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:33,042
Merritt, you don't know
what that's gonna do.

578
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:38,582
You're right.

579
00:37:40,158 --> 00:37:41,158
What...

580
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:52,604
Funny thing about doing the
same thing over and over again,

581
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:55,504
you learn how to do it better.

582
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:59,106
I suppose that's the true
purpose of a library now?

583
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,404
Ah.

584
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,274
Your treasured tomes.

585
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:04,905
Each one a life.

586
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:06,878
A destiny.

587
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:10,455
I'm most curious about who
my next few wives will be.

588
00:38:10,522 --> 00:38:13,356
You never know, Alice.

589
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,955
Let's go find our
books, shall we?

590
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:27,833
Something to add,
Madam Librarian? Yes.

591
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,934
If you really want
to know your future,

592
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:33,134
you'd better be
able to speed read.

593
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:36,609
No!

594
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:39,212
No! No!

595
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:41,618
No! No! No!

596
00:39:05,877 --> 00:39:06,877
Enter.

597
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:25,830
I was just checking to
make sure you were all right.

598
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:28,428
Thank you for your concern.

599
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:31,030
I'm fine.

600
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:33,864
Just a bit tired.

601
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:35,005
Hmm.

602
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:36,402
I can imagine.

603
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:40,143
Hmm.

604
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,702
You were incredible out there.

605
00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:43,673
Maybe once.

606
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,445
Now it's, um...

607
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:49,148
What's the military term?

608
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:51,284
Holding action.

609
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:54,550
Nothing but holding actions.

610
00:39:56,427 --> 00:40:00,057
I saw that not all the
Centurions returned.

611
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:09,234
Good night, Seb.

612
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:18,744
What exactly are
we looking for, sir?

613
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:21,914
Not what. Who.

614
00:40:22,654 --> 00:40:24,646
Well, both.

615
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:01,825
Grab it. Grab it.

616
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:15,298
You two know each other?

617
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:17,431
No.

618
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:22,343
Then you won't mind taking
charge of its imprisonment.

619
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,973
Of course not, sir.

620
00:41:39,297 --> 00:41:44,793
And all the books on
everyone are gone for good.

621
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:50,433
Maybe that means actual free will
now, and not any of that predestined shit.

622
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:56,880
Or lots of rewrites to do.

623
00:41:57,315 --> 00:42:00,046
Sorry, Zelda. It's a
bad day for everybody.

624
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:02,452
At least the fires
drove them out.

625
00:42:02,587 --> 00:42:05,216
We think they got about
half the collection. Mmm.

626
00:42:05,323 --> 00:42:07,690
Yep, and everything
on the Convergence.

627
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:11,389
So what do we do now? We
try and trade with the Visigoths?

628
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:13,326
What do we have that they want?

629
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:18,131
I mean, the Overlord kind
of liked me. Off the table.

630
00:42:19,604 --> 00:42:22,130
I read most of the books
on the Convergence.

631
00:42:22,607 --> 00:42:24,303
Enough to know
it can be stopped.

632
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:28,777
It's almost impossible,
but not complicated.

633
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:35,513
Zelda, please tell.

634
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:37,748
Oh. Of course.

635
00:42:39,624 --> 00:42:43,755
Well, all you have
to do is move that.

636
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:46,091
Move?

637
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,559
The fucking moon.

638
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,160
Well, at least we
know where it is.
