2
00:00:06,484 --> 00:00:08,225
- Previously
on "The Magicians"...

3
00:00:16,103 --> 00:00:18,583
- Your new lady Centurion.

4
00:00:22,805 --> 00:00:25,677
- You said you heard voices
from other worlds.

5
00:00:25,721 --> 00:00:27,157
- You hearing something?

6
00:00:27,201 --> 00:00:28,637
- A signal?

7
00:00:32,467 --> 00:00:35,209
Professor, did the signal
make you do that?

8
00:00:37,907 --> 00:00:40,170
- He loved you.

9
00:00:40,214 --> 00:00:42,303
Why would I want to take that
away from you now?

10
00:00:42,346 --> 00:00:45,523
That would be so cruel.

11
00:00:45,567 --> 00:00:48,874
- You really think
I didn't know there was more?

12
00:00:48,918 --> 00:00:51,268
What was I supposed
to do?

13
00:00:51,312 --> 00:00:54,445
Demand that he only love me?

14
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:56,621
- "Dark King"
is a little generic

15
00:00:56,665 --> 00:00:58,667
as villain names go,
wouldn't you say?

16
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,885
- I have notes.

17
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:01,626
Although he is
somewhat effective.

18
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,324
Everyone seems terrified
of him.

19
00:01:03,367 --> 00:01:05,891
- Elliot, Taker!
Back up!

20
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,551
- You all right?

21
00:01:15,814 --> 00:01:18,165
Death is so simple...

22
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:20,297
and life is so complicated.

23
00:01:21,603 --> 00:01:23,300
I know.

24
00:01:25,781 --> 00:01:28,523
- I think I almost fucked
the Dark King.

25
00:01:28,566 --> 00:01:30,394
- Are you familiar with
the Harmonic Convergence?

26
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:33,354
A rare and powerful
astrological occurrence,

27
00:01:33,397 --> 00:01:34,920
a magnifier of magic.

28
00:01:34,964 --> 00:01:37,401
- How bad will it be?
- Death toll in the millions.

29
00:01:37,445 --> 00:01:38,837
Maybe much higher.
- How can we stop it?

30
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:40,535
- You can't.

31
00:01:46,715 --> 00:01:48,630
- Hedge witches--
they're used to crumbs.

32
00:01:48,673 --> 00:01:51,154
And, yes, ambient is low, but
you know what amplifies it?

33
00:01:51,198 --> 00:01:52,329
Cooperative magic.

34
00:01:52,373 --> 00:01:54,201
We tell everyone,

35
00:01:54,244 --> 00:01:56,855
and we all do the same thing
at the same time.

36
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,164
And I thought that
if I took on more power

37
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:03,819
and more responsibility...

38
00:02:03,862 --> 00:02:05,603
that I would want heroin less.

39
00:02:05,647 --> 00:02:07,866
When I thought I'd relapsed,

40
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,694
I was relieved.

41
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:15,178
So...

42
00:02:15,222 --> 00:02:18,442
I've been clean for a year.

43
00:02:20,357 --> 00:02:23,273
Thanks, but 
maybe hold that

44
00:02:23,317 --> 00:02:25,884
'cause I've been jonesing hard.

45
00:02:31,977 --> 00:02:34,502
I'm a hedge.

46
00:02:34,545 --> 00:02:36,808
You know, before we helped save
magic, we got a shit deal.

47
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:38,201
Right?

48
00:02:38,245 --> 00:02:40,334
There was, 
a blood worm scare,

49
00:02:40,377 --> 00:02:42,901
so the Library gave a lot
of hedges the Reed's Mark.

50
00:02:42,945 --> 00:02:44,468
Well, get a mark,

51
00:02:44,512 --> 00:02:46,557
you're magically castrated
till they take it off.

52
00:02:46,601 --> 00:02:49,386
The Library's imploding.
They can't fix it

53
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:51,475
and the marked ones are looking
at me, like,

54
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,217
"Hey, bossy pants,
you rallied us to save magic.

55
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:55,827
How about saving us?"

56
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:59,788
And I found a spell to remove
the marks in a depository.

57
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:02,660
Only, all of a sudden,
it's gone.

58
00:03:02,704 --> 00:03:06,751
But I know, only way to move
something that warded

59
00:03:06,795 --> 00:03:09,493
is to move it though
the Etheric Realm.

60
00:03:09,537 --> 00:03:11,321
- Cool, I've heard
it's awesome there.

61
00:03:11,365 --> 00:03:13,018
What's the prob?

62
00:03:13,062 --> 00:03:16,500
- The prob...

63
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:18,763
is there's only one way
into the Realm.

64
00:03:20,374 --> 00:03:22,202
Anybody heard of RCH?

65
00:03:23,725 --> 00:03:25,248
Nickname Archie?

66
00:03:28,556 --> 00:03:31,559
Yep.

67
00:03:31,602 --> 00:03:35,215
The way to save every marked
hedge is to drop acid.

68
00:03:36,955 --> 00:03:39,480
A true 12-step conundrum.

69
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:47,879
- I'm assuming you have
the Archie on you.

70
00:03:47,923 --> 00:03:50,404
Call your sponsor, kid.

71
00:03:50,447 --> 00:03:53,450
- It'd make sense...

72
00:03:53,494 --> 00:03:55,713
in case somebody here,

73
00:03:55,757 --> 00:03:57,802
you know, gave you permission
to jump off the wagon.

74
00:03:57,846 --> 00:03:59,717
Sorry, M.A. is so strict.

75
00:03:59,761 --> 00:04:01,676
- You met the nice me.

76
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:04,069
Here's the real me.
Fuck off.

77
00:04:07,943 --> 00:04:10,598
- What?

78
00:04:13,731 --> 00:04:16,343
- Well, I take
the anonymous part

79
00:04:16,386 --> 00:04:19,520
of Magicians Anonymous
very seriously.

80
00:04:19,563 --> 00:04:22,000
- So you quit drinking.

81
00:04:22,044 --> 00:04:24,916
- 33 days, 6 hours,
19 minutes of skin-peeling,

82
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,745
soul-searing hell ago, yes.

83
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:29,573
- Well, I can relate.

84
00:04:29,617 --> 00:04:31,314
- As can I,

85
00:04:31,358 --> 00:04:33,969
in regards to the crushing
weight of leadership.

86
00:04:36,754 --> 00:04:40,105
I've never seen Archie.

87
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:41,672
May I?

88
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:46,721
Why two?

89
00:04:48,462 --> 00:04:50,072
- In case the first trip's
a bust.

90
00:04:50,115 --> 00:04:52,727
- Or in case it's fun.

91
00:04:55,077 --> 00:04:56,818
I've been dismissive

92
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:58,863
or downright derisive
about hedges,

93
00:04:58,907 --> 00:05:01,866
and I admit,
I was quite wrong.

94
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:04,129
And I'd like to try
and make, um...

95
00:05:04,173 --> 00:05:05,653
Hell, what's the word?

96
00:05:05,696 --> 00:05:07,394
- Amends.

97
00:05:07,437 --> 00:05:09,787
- Yes.

98
00:05:14,662 --> 00:05:16,403
- Are you crazy?

99
00:05:16,446 --> 00:05:19,971
I am, but I am not an addict.

100
00:05:20,015 --> 00:05:22,583
I am an alcoholic.
Totally different.

101
00:05:23,888 --> 00:05:26,108
- So I will go hunt down
the depository.

102
00:05:31,548 --> 00:05:33,681
- You're not going alone.

103
00:05:43,865 --> 00:05:46,563
- So we know about
the Harmonic Convergence.

104
00:05:46,607 --> 00:05:48,522
The problem is we knew
just enough to be useless.

105
00:05:48,565 --> 00:05:51,525
So maybe we find someone
who can see the big picture.

106
00:05:51,568 --> 00:05:52,830
- "Find."

107
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:54,441
- Summon.

108
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:56,747
- A god?

109
00:05:58,662 --> 00:06:00,708
Whoa,
you've got to be kidding me!

110
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:01,883
- Wait, Julia,
before you do that,

111
00:06:01,926 --> 00:06:03,493
I think the Library
might have--

112
00:06:03,537 --> 00:06:05,887
- Ooh.
- Penny?

113
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,628
I'm fine.

114
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:09,412
Wow, that is
a whole nother level.

115
00:06:09,456 --> 00:06:10,500
Jesus.

116
00:06:10,544 --> 00:06:12,110
- I thought the patch
was working.

117
00:06:12,154 --> 00:06:13,764
- Merritt's signal just
keeps getting stronger.

118
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:15,549
I'm sorry, I can't stay.

119
00:06:15,592 --> 00:06:17,899
I'm--I'm just no use until
I get this under control.

120
00:06:17,942 --> 00:06:20,031
Maybe do the summoning
once I get back?

121
00:06:20,075 --> 00:06:21,990
- Let me know
if things get too weird.

122
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:23,774
- Yeah, same.

123
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:33,131
- The Library has summoned me
about 7,000 times

124
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:34,872
to come work there,

125
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,613
and they also gave me this.

126
00:06:38,223 --> 00:06:40,487
It'll get me in anytime I want.

127
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,140
I'll bring back whatever
they have

128
00:06:42,184 --> 00:06:45,013
on their Harmonic Convergence
as fast as I can.

129
00:06:45,056 --> 00:06:46,449
Are you sure you'll be okay?

130
00:06:46,493 --> 00:06:47,929
- Yeah.
Good luck.

131
00:06:47,972 --> 00:06:50,018
- You too.

132
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,153
- It makes the signal
is hitting you harder.

133
00:06:55,197 --> 00:06:56,720
I'm starting to actually hear--

134
00:06:56,764 --> 00:06:58,156
- A voice?

135
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,811
- You too?
- Kind of.

136
00:07:00,855 --> 00:07:02,813
I can't make out actual words,

137
00:07:02,857 --> 00:07:04,249
at least not ones
I can understand.

138
00:07:04,293 --> 00:07:06,730
- Is that for me?
- No.

139
00:07:06,774 --> 00:07:08,732
The problem with
the first patch was that it

140
00:07:08,776 --> 00:07:10,778
is just a deflector.

141
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:12,736
The signal is getting
bounced off,

142
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,477
but I'm still getting hit
by the reverb.

143
00:07:14,521 --> 00:07:17,959
This one should absorb
the sound and kill it.

144
00:07:18,002 --> 00:07:20,135
And if it does, we'll see
what we can gin up for you.

145
00:07:36,107 --> 00:07:38,109
Okay.

146
00:07:38,153 --> 00:07:40,503
Better, I think.

147
00:07:43,288 --> 00:07:44,899
Okay.

148
00:07:49,773 --> 00:07:51,949
- What was that?

149
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:55,649
Where did you go?
- I don't remember.

150
00:07:55,692 --> 00:07:57,694
- You didn't blip out
on purpose.

151
00:07:57,738 --> 00:07:59,957
- No, it's like when the pain
got so I was gonna pass out,

152
00:08:00,001 --> 00:08:01,219
I just--I just went.

153
00:08:01,263 --> 00:08:02,830
- You need a doctor.

154
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,144
- I'm impressed.

155
00:08:13,188 --> 00:08:15,146
Not with this.
It's dreadful.

156
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,322
Sorry.

157
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:19,890
With your skills
as a Magician.

158
00:08:19,934 --> 00:08:21,283
Who trained you?

159
00:08:21,326 --> 00:08:23,546
- Well, I just picked up
a little bit here and there.

160
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,156
Clearly not enough,

161
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,854
since I couldn't put a scratch
on that Taker.

162
00:08:26,897 --> 00:08:28,986
- Don't be modest.

163
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,032
You have what it takes
to be quite formidable.

164
00:08:31,075 --> 00:08:32,816
I could use you.

165
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,689
Official Court Magician
in Defense of the Kingdom.

166
00:08:35,732 --> 00:08:39,780
You could teach others
and be taught by me.

167
00:08:39,823 --> 00:08:42,086
- I would be honored...

168
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:45,307
Your Majesty.

169
00:08:51,835 --> 00:08:54,795
A different lining perhaps.
Gray, please.

170
00:09:01,105 --> 00:09:03,238
When we are alone,

171
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:05,109
it can be Seb.

172
00:09:05,153 --> 00:09:07,329
- Well, Seb,

173
00:09:07,372 --> 00:09:10,027
we have a saying
where I come from.

174
00:09:10,071 --> 00:09:12,726
You kind of buried the lede
on...

175
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:14,728
on the...

176
00:09:14,771 --> 00:09:17,861
well, on you.

177
00:09:17,905 --> 00:09:20,734
- I didn't mean to deceive you.

178
00:09:20,777 --> 00:09:23,998
Kings have to be very careful
about who to trust.

179
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:27,610
And also, it can be
a relief to not...

180
00:09:27,654 --> 00:09:29,743
- Feel the weight of the crown
on your head every second?

181
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:32,354
- You are wise.

182
00:09:32,397 --> 00:09:34,704
But I knew that already.

183
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,972
In any case, settle in,

184
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:43,670
and we will get down
to the particulars

185
00:09:43,713 --> 00:09:45,367
of your duties later.

186
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:47,021
All right?

187
00:09:47,064 --> 00:09:49,066
- All right.

188
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,851
Your Majesty.

189
00:09:57,292 --> 00:09:59,424
- Please.
- What?

190
00:09:59,468 --> 00:10:01,818
- If you say his gorgeous eyes
see into your soul,

191
00:10:01,862 --> 00:10:03,298
I'm gonna puke all over
your new leggings,

192
00:10:03,341 --> 00:10:05,082
which are quite sharp,
by the way.

193
00:10:05,126 --> 00:10:06,344
- Thank you.

194
00:10:06,388 --> 00:10:08,738
- Legs for days.
- Thank you.

195
00:10:08,782 --> 00:10:10,261
But I never said his eyes
were gorgeous

196
00:10:10,305 --> 00:10:11,959
or that he sees into my soul.

197
00:10:12,002 --> 00:10:13,656
But weirdly, he might.

198
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,005
- Or he's sucking
the soul out of you

199
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:16,703
because he doesn't have one.

200
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:20,141
- Um, he did save my life.
- He's called the Dark King.

201
00:10:20,184 --> 00:10:22,099
- You're called
Margo the Destroyer.

202
00:10:22,143 --> 00:10:23,797
- I was a woman
ruling a patriarchy,

203
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,973
my brand had to be overkill.

204
00:10:26,016 --> 00:10:27,931
Bottom line, he likes you.

205
00:10:27,975 --> 00:10:29,977
You just have to find out
what he's really about.

206
00:10:34,198 --> 00:10:36,374
I'll see if my fellow
Centurions like to gossip.

207
00:10:36,418 --> 00:10:38,768
Then we regroup and decide--

208
00:10:38,812 --> 00:10:41,771
benevolent dictator
by necessity

209
00:10:41,815 --> 00:10:44,731
or psychopathic despot
by choice?

210
00:10:44,774 --> 00:10:47,690
- What if he's the latter?
- Then I always got his back.

211
00:10:47,734 --> 00:10:51,259
Perfect place to bury these.

212
00:11:33,388 --> 00:11:36,043
Zelda.
- Help me, please.

213
00:11:36,086 --> 00:11:37,174
- What's going on?
Who are they?

214
00:11:37,218 --> 00:11:38,436
- Visigoths.

215
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,003
- What, like Marilyn Manson?

216
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:42,876
- Visi-goths!
- Germanic barbarians.

217
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,442
- Who always show up
at the absolute worst points

218
00:11:44,486 --> 00:11:45,530
in history.

219
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,990
Fucking hell.

220
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:12,644
- Sorry.
Did you--did you want Hades?

221
00:12:14,342 --> 00:12:17,780
I could get word to him,
but, what a dick.

222
00:12:17,824 --> 00:12:19,651
- Are you...

223
00:12:19,695 --> 00:12:21,828
- I'm Clarion,
Goddess of Melody.

224
00:12:21,871 --> 00:12:25,005
Hey, Julia, I have, had my
eye on you for quite a while.

225
00:12:25,048 --> 00:12:26,789
- You have?

226
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,356
- Yeah, yeah.
So you were mortal, right?

227
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,532
And then you were one of us,
and now you're back to mortal.

228
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:32,012
You're
one tough cookie, cookie.

229
00:12:32,055 --> 00:12:33,709
- Thanks?

230
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,667
- Yeah, but the way
that you're imagining

231
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,801
the Harmonic Convergence
isn't quite enough.

232
00:12:38,845 --> 00:12:40,847
It's so much worse.

233
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:44,372
So, when all the spells cast by
all the Magicians go haywire,

234
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:47,288
you're gonna get earthquakes,
fire, drought,

235
00:12:47,331 --> 00:12:49,638
starvation, plague.

236
00:12:49,681 --> 00:12:50,987
And then comes cannibalism.

237
00:12:51,031 --> 00:12:53,990
- Um, is there anything
you can do?

238
00:12:54,034 --> 00:12:55,731
- I could stop it.

239
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,559
How would that be?
- Great.

240
00:12:57,602 --> 00:13:00,040
But I'm assuming there's
something you want in return.

241
00:13:02,694 --> 00:13:05,828
Yeah, you...

242
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:07,787
You have dealt
with a god or two.

243
00:13:09,701 --> 00:13:11,051
- Yep.

244
00:13:11,094 --> 00:13:12,661
- I want to be human.

245
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:16,056
Like you.

246
00:13:16,099 --> 00:13:18,319
- Excuse me?

247
00:13:18,362 --> 00:13:21,713
- I worship you, Julia.

248
00:13:23,367 --> 00:13:24,716
How did you do it, though?

249
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,501
Because that's the part that
I couldn't quite see.

250
00:13:26,544 --> 00:13:27,894
There's, like,
some kind of cloak

251
00:13:27,937 --> 00:13:29,591
around the whole process.

252
00:13:29,634 --> 00:13:33,073
Rumor is it had something
to do with a book.

253
00:13:33,116 --> 00:13:36,946
- Yeah, okay, I'm gonna need
just a few more details...

254
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,818
I don't know,
starting with why.

255
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:40,776
- Do I want to be human?

256
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,908
It's simple.

257
00:13:41,951 --> 00:13:44,432
So I'm the Goddess of Melody,
right?

258
00:13:44,475 --> 00:13:47,739
But did you know that
we can't actually feel music?

259
00:13:47,783 --> 00:13:50,873
Like, we understand it, we can
tell the good from the bad--

260
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:52,788
sort of.

261
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:56,748
- So you want to be human
so you can do karaoke?

262
00:13:56,792 --> 00:13:59,926
- I know that it sounds
like hubris itself,

263
00:13:59,969 --> 00:14:04,669
but, I think
I could be a rock star.

264
00:14:04,713 --> 00:14:06,802
I mean, I pretty much know
the gig, right?

265
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,456
They all prayed to me.

266
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:10,458
Except for Amy Winehouse, okay?

267
00:14:10,501 --> 00:14:12,025
Look how that one turned out.
Poor thing.

268
00:14:12,068 --> 00:14:13,722
Any other questions?

269
00:14:13,765 --> 00:14:15,115
- Boy.

270
00:14:46,668 --> 00:14:48,844
This is amazing.

271
00:14:54,023 --> 00:14:55,633
Careful!

272
00:14:55,677 --> 00:14:58,027
- Whoa!

273
00:14:58,071 --> 00:14:59,855
- The world isn't quite gone.

274
00:15:10,561 --> 00:15:12,433
this is what my neck
feels like.

275
00:15:16,567 --> 00:15:18,743
Come on!
The depository.

276
00:15:18,787 --> 00:15:20,441
Come on.

277
00:15:34,585 --> 00:15:36,196
- Welcome!

278
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:37,719
- H-hi.

279
00:15:39,895 --> 00:15:42,898
We're looking for a depository
that was, um--

280
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:43,899
it was over there.

281
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,032
- Eat up.

282
00:15:46,075 --> 00:15:47,990
- Yeah, in a sec, but,

283
00:15:48,034 --> 00:15:49,905
if you know where
the depository is...

284
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,125
- Nobody knows where anything
is in the Realm,

285
00:15:52,168 --> 00:15:53,604
except for the Emperor.

286
00:15:53,648 --> 00:15:54,910
- Dear God.

287
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,565
This is strange.

288
00:15:57,608 --> 00:15:58,958
It tastes like...

289
00:16:00,611 --> 00:16:02,744
Burning charcoal,

290
00:16:02,787 --> 00:16:05,007
hamburgers on a grill.

291
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,881
Popsicles.

292
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,236
- Is that bunny staring at us?

293
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:19,587
- Summer at the beach.

294
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:21,067
Brown bunny.

295
00:16:22,807 --> 00:16:24,505
Sunglasses.

296
00:16:24,548 --> 00:16:26,159
Beach clue.

297
00:16:26,202 --> 00:16:28,509
- I'm trying real hard
to give a shit,

298
00:16:28,552 --> 00:16:31,077
but it just feels so good
to be high again.

299
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,037
- I guess we follow him.

300
00:16:35,081 --> 00:16:38,258
- So we all know the threat
we're facing.

301
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:40,695
These are Fillory's
second greatest protectors

302
00:16:40,738 --> 00:16:42,175
against the Takers.

303
00:16:42,218 --> 00:16:44,742
Who can tell me the first?

304
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:46,788
- His Majesty,
the Dark King.

305
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:48,050
- Which is why protecting him

306
00:16:48,094 --> 00:16:49,965
is the most important job
in the kingdom.

307
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,576
His Majesty is immortal, yes,

308
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,578
but he is not invulnerable.

309
00:16:54,622 --> 00:16:57,016
- Which makes us?

310
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:59,583
- Expendable.

311
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:05,633
- A group of royal map makers

312
00:17:05,676 --> 00:17:07,069
won't make it back here
till after dark.

313
00:17:07,113 --> 00:17:09,158
And the First Cohort is trapped
in a blizzard

314
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:10,812
in Madness Plains.

315
00:17:10,855 --> 00:17:12,553
You wet-nosed whelps
are all we've got.

316
00:17:12,596 --> 00:17:15,947
Well, you, me...

317
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:20,561
And our glorious leader.

318
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,957
- What are we looking at here?

319
00:17:26,001 --> 00:17:28,221
- His Majesty wants the kingdom
to witness him

320
00:17:28,264 --> 00:17:30,223
saving subjects
from the Takers.

321
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:32,790
These are in almost
every room of the castle,

322
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:34,183
most of the taverns, and...

323
00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:45,194
- It's fucking Fox News.

324
00:17:45,238 --> 00:17:48,023
- Foxes all lie.
Who'd ever believe their news?

325
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,677
- His Majesty,
I'm afraid all we have

326
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,070
are the newest recruits.

327
00:17:51,113 --> 00:17:52,680
- Who'll learn by doing.

328
00:17:52,723 --> 00:17:54,856
- Yes, sir.
With me, recruits.

329
00:17:54,899 --> 00:17:56,858
On three.

330
00:17:56,901 --> 00:17:58,338
Quick step now.

331
00:17:58,381 --> 00:18:00,209
Ready, hup.

332
00:18:04,735 --> 00:18:07,086
- Give me a phaser
and a red shirt.

333
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:09,131
- What?
- Yeah, just don't.

334
00:18:14,658 --> 00:18:16,269
Whoa.

335
00:18:21,317 --> 00:18:23,841
The Binder was annoyed...

336
00:18:23,885 --> 00:18:26,148
but unsurprised
Julia had failed

337
00:18:26,192 --> 00:18:27,758
to burn him out of existence,

338
00:18:27,802 --> 00:18:30,848
per their agreement.

339
00:18:30,892 --> 00:18:34,548
- Look, I just thought maybe
we were both a little hasty

340
00:18:34,591 --> 00:18:37,333
and, I don't know,
maybe I'd keep you safe,

341
00:18:37,377 --> 00:18:39,248
let us both cool down.

342
00:18:39,292 --> 00:18:40,641
So can you do it?

343
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:44,166
- The Binder stared at Julia...

344
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,863
wondering
if she'd learned nothing

345
00:18:45,907 --> 00:18:48,301
from her interactions
with deities.

346
00:18:48,344 --> 00:18:50,564
- I don't have a lot
of choice here, okay?

347
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:52,566
If you can't do this,
the Earth is doomed.

348
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:55,656
- "Again?"
The Binder asked...

349
00:18:55,699 --> 00:18:58,398
bored.

350
00:18:58,441 --> 00:19:01,488
Still, the Binder wondered,

351
00:19:01,531 --> 00:19:06,493
"Why on Earth would Julia
trust this 'Clarion'?"

352
00:19:06,536 --> 00:19:10,410
- I don't, but the options
here are narrowing.

353
00:19:10,453 --> 00:19:14,544
- As a book, the Binder enjoyed
any opportunity to teach.

354
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:16,198
And here was a word

355
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:18,374
Julia needed desperately
to understand--

356
00:19:20,942 --> 00:19:22,683
No.

357
00:19:24,598 --> 00:19:26,730
- So are these
the same Visigoths

358
00:19:26,774 --> 00:19:28,558
that raided cultural
strongholds on Earth?

359
00:19:28,602 --> 00:19:30,212
- Burned
the Library of Alexandria,

360
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:31,909
sacked the statuary
of Ancient Greece,

361
00:19:31,953 --> 00:19:34,434
burned Rome, London,
Paris, Chicago,

362
00:19:34,477 --> 00:19:36,740
where they framed poor
Mrs. O'Leary's cow.

363
00:19:36,784 --> 00:19:38,481
That's around the time
they started getting bored

364
00:19:38,525 --> 00:19:39,874
and moved into the multiverse.

365
00:19:39,917 --> 00:19:41,441
- Okay,
I'm sorry about all this,

366
00:19:41,484 --> 00:19:42,833
but I need every book
you have

367
00:19:42,877 --> 00:19:44,400
on the Harmonic Convergence.

368
00:19:44,444 --> 00:19:46,750
- We have a vast collection
on the other side of that door.

369
00:19:46,794 --> 00:19:48,578
- Wow.
Well, my timing is--

370
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:58,806
- How do you do?

371
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:01,200
I'm Visigoth Overlord Terence.

372
00:20:01,243 --> 00:20:02,810
Apologies for the mess,

373
00:20:02,853 --> 00:20:05,508
but recall,
I did announce our incursion

374
00:20:05,552 --> 00:20:07,293
and asked you most politely

375
00:20:07,336 --> 00:20:09,295
to drop all your defenses
and surrender,

376
00:20:09,338 --> 00:20:11,427
having given my word

377
00:20:11,471 --> 00:20:13,777
that you would
be absolutely safe.

378
00:20:13,821 --> 00:20:16,389
But the word of a barbarian?

379
00:20:16,432 --> 00:20:18,304
- Actually,
Visigoths are famous

380
00:20:18,347 --> 00:20:19,740
for always keeping their word.

381
00:20:19,783 --> 00:20:21,785
- That's weird.

382
00:20:21,829 --> 00:20:24,962
- My dear, if you'd be so kind.

383
00:20:26,703 --> 00:20:28,314
- Sorry, I'm just
a little confused here,

384
00:20:28,357 --> 00:20:29,793
but you seem...

385
00:20:29,837 --> 00:20:32,579
- Educated?
Polite to a fault?

386
00:20:32,622 --> 00:20:35,712
We seek to acquire only
the deepest knowledge,

387
00:20:35,756 --> 00:20:37,410
highest art,

388
00:20:37,453 --> 00:20:38,759
and most illuminating
philosophy.

389
00:20:38,802 --> 00:20:40,935
Is it any wonder
a little might rub off?

390
00:20:40,978 --> 00:20:42,719
- What about all those
inconvenient commandments

391
00:20:42,763 --> 00:20:44,330
about theft?

392
00:20:44,373 --> 00:20:45,635
- Alice, it's no use debating.

393
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,507
- Alice, is it?

394
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,899
That's lovely.

395
00:20:48,943 --> 00:20:50,814
- Thank you?

396
00:20:50,858 --> 00:20:54,253
- We seek only those works that
transcend appetite and avarice,

397
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:56,342
that touch upon the immutable.

398
00:20:56,385 --> 00:20:59,301
That's why we spend so little
time on Earth anymore.

399
00:20:59,345 --> 00:21:01,738
What's left to raid?

400
00:21:01,782 --> 00:21:03,697
Tent pole franchises?

401
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,874
Jeff Koons?
The, um...

402
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:08,310
hoodie?

403
00:21:08,354 --> 00:21:09,616
- Visigoths never lie,

404
00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:12,009
but they never tell
the whole truth either.

405
00:21:12,053 --> 00:21:13,663
I know what you're
really after.

406
00:21:27,547 --> 00:21:29,288
- The books of everyone...

407
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:30,506
- Is actually what they want.

408
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,029
Every sentient being's life,
birth to death.

409
00:21:32,073 --> 00:21:33,683
Can you imagine?

410
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:35,511
They could plan the pillaging
of every great work

411
00:21:35,555 --> 00:21:37,034
before it's painted
or written.

412
00:21:37,078 --> 00:21:38,688
Not to mention
the stock market.

413
00:21:38,732 --> 00:21:40,342
- "Stock market"?

414
00:21:40,386 --> 00:21:41,517
- They have a thing
about shorting.

415
00:21:41,561 --> 00:21:43,040
They think it's hilarious.

416
00:21:43,084 --> 00:21:44,651
- Look, Zelda, I understand
how important this is to you,

417
00:21:44,694 --> 00:21:46,043
but what's the point?

418
00:21:46,087 --> 00:21:47,871
They're gonna get in here,
and this is the only door.

419
00:21:49,438 --> 00:21:51,048
- Okay, how about this?

420
00:21:51,092 --> 00:21:53,529
You want to teach?
Teach.

421
00:21:53,573 --> 00:21:55,052
"You?

422
00:21:55,096 --> 00:21:57,533
To turn a goddess mortal?"

423
00:21:57,577 --> 00:22:01,363
The Binder inquired, with not
a small amount of disdain.

424
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,627
Too tough?

425
00:22:04,671 --> 00:22:06,934
Fine.

426
00:22:06,977 --> 00:22:08,849
Maybe I'll just hand you
to her.

427
00:22:08,892 --> 00:22:12,331
- The Binder realized Julia
had cornered him

428
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:14,637
with his own credo.

429
00:22:14,681 --> 00:22:16,900
But still, he wondered,

430
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:18,946
what was in it for him?

431
00:22:18,989 --> 00:22:21,601
- Well, how's this,
paper boy?

432
00:22:23,733 --> 00:22:26,736
- Said the Binder...

433
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,043
"Let the lessons commence."

434
00:22:36,572 --> 00:22:40,576
- Whoa!

435
00:22:57,811 --> 00:22:59,813
Socks?

436
00:22:59,856 --> 00:23:01,423
None of them match.

437
00:23:07,473 --> 00:23:10,432
- So this is where they go.

438
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:13,870
If you see
a red and orange argyle,

439
00:23:13,914 --> 00:23:15,959
cashmere, size 13,

440
00:23:16,003 --> 00:23:17,439
grab it, please.

441
00:23:18,962 --> 00:23:21,704
I don't usually say this
when I'm this high,

442
00:23:21,748 --> 00:23:24,054
but we really need to focus.

443
00:23:24,098 --> 00:23:26,622
- Exactly.
Red and orange.

444
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:28,145
- Yeah.

445
00:23:28,189 --> 00:23:30,626
No, no,
we're looking for...

446
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,628
Christ!

447
00:23:32,672 --> 00:23:35,152
- I don't believe it.
There it is.

448
00:23:39,505 --> 00:23:40,984
- You were right.

449
00:23:41,028 --> 00:23:43,073
Just needed to focus.

450
00:23:44,988 --> 00:23:46,816
- Bunny.
Bunny.

451
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:56,783
Um, hi.

452
00:23:58,872 --> 00:24:01,091
we're looking for an emperor.

453
00:24:01,135 --> 00:24:02,484
- Hey, Kady.

454
00:24:03,877 --> 00:24:05,139
Hank.

455
00:24:05,182 --> 00:24:07,837
- Hank.
I don't hate that.

456
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:11,493
- You know us?

457
00:24:11,537 --> 00:24:14,496
- What kind of an emp
would I be if I didn't?

458
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,063
You roll into my town,

459
00:24:16,106 --> 00:24:18,065
I take a gander
at your thoughts,

460
00:24:18,108 --> 00:24:20,807
and if I dig ya,
I show you the brown bunny.

461
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:23,026
And I dig ya both.

462
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,551
Congratulations
on the first sock.

463
00:24:27,074 --> 00:24:29,685
How great is Archie,
by the way?

464
00:24:31,078 --> 00:24:33,602
- Pretty great,
once you let it settle in.

465
00:24:33,646 --> 00:24:36,083
- And as long as you're here,

466
00:24:36,126 --> 00:24:38,215
the high never goes away.

467
00:24:39,565 --> 00:24:41,654
- Wow.
That's--

468
00:24:41,697 --> 00:24:43,525
- That's perfect.
- Yeah.

469
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:46,528
We--we really need
to find the...

470
00:24:46,572 --> 00:24:49,705
Jesus.
The--the...

471
00:24:49,749 --> 00:24:51,185
- Depository, Kady.

472
00:24:51,228 --> 00:24:52,839
- Right, right.

473
00:24:52,882 --> 00:24:54,884
Can you tell us
where that is now?

474
00:24:54,928 --> 00:24:56,582
- Sure can.

475
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:58,888
It won't be free, though.

476
00:24:58,932 --> 00:25:01,021
Even here
where everything's fun,

477
00:25:01,064 --> 00:25:02,544
there's a price.

478
00:25:04,241 --> 00:25:07,027
Sit.
Have some suds.

479
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,724
This'll take a sec.

480
00:25:08,768 --> 00:25:10,509
- What will?

481
00:25:10,552 --> 00:25:13,120
- For me to dig deeper
into your thoughts,

482
00:25:13,163 --> 00:25:16,906
see which one of you
gets to leave...

483
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:19,082
and who has to stay.

484
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:35,098
- The map makers are in there.

485
00:25:37,797 --> 00:25:39,538
- Do you hear that?

486
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,630
- Boy.

487
00:25:44,673 --> 00:25:46,806
- Breathing.

488
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:48,590
Coming from there.

489
00:25:48,634 --> 00:25:52,072
- With respect, Majesty,
there.

490
00:25:52,115 --> 00:25:54,117
- Guys, there.

491
00:25:55,858 --> 00:25:57,556
There, there.
We're surrounded.

492
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:58,687
- You can see them?

493
00:25:58,731 --> 00:26:00,036
- I have really good
night vision.

494
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,038
My grandpa married
a snow leopard,

495
00:26:02,082 --> 00:26:03,213
is the rumor.

496
00:26:03,257 --> 00:26:05,564
- Sire.

497
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,568
- Where is he going?

498
00:26:12,005 --> 00:26:13,876
- I've seen that before.

499
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,617
It's a legit royal tactic.

500
00:26:15,661 --> 00:26:17,053
Never fear.

501
00:26:18,968 --> 00:26:20,622
- Shouldn't we get him
to the infirmary?

502
00:26:22,015 --> 00:26:23,799
With all the newbies
practicing during surges,

503
00:26:23,843 --> 00:26:25,801
it's like a meat locker
down there

504
00:26:25,845 --> 00:26:29,631
where the meat's alive...
until it's not.

505
00:26:31,154 --> 00:26:32,547
- Penny?

506
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,768
- Get...

507
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:36,943
Julia.

508
00:26:36,986 --> 00:26:38,074
- Who?

509
00:26:53,481 --> 00:26:55,309
- So our Dark King--

510
00:26:55,352 --> 00:26:56,658
did he just shit the doublet?

511
00:26:58,486 --> 00:27:00,096
I hope so.

512
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,142
I really don't want to be
the only one who does it with--

513
00:28:04,204 --> 00:28:06,336
That's amazing, right?

514
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:09,165
I mean, honestly,
fuck Netflix.

515
00:28:09,209 --> 00:28:10,384
That is peak television.

516
00:28:10,427 --> 00:28:12,212
- Jesus.

517
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,389
No kidding.

518
00:28:15,432 --> 00:28:17,304
You kick some serious ass
for your kingdom.

519
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,321
Pretty cool.

520
00:28:34,364 --> 00:28:36,410
You're both equally awesome,

521
00:28:36,453 --> 00:28:39,239
by which I mean,
totally fucked up.

522
00:28:39,282 --> 00:28:41,894
By which I mean,
I get you're on a mission.

523
00:28:41,937 --> 00:28:43,504
One of you has got to jet,

524
00:28:43,547 --> 00:28:46,725
but either one of you
can hang for eternity.

525
00:28:48,335 --> 00:28:50,250
You guys decide.

526
00:28:50,293 --> 00:28:52,600
- I'll stay.
- No, you will not.

527
00:28:52,643 --> 00:28:53,819
- Are you kidding?

528
00:28:53,862 --> 00:28:55,908
This place is heroin heaven.

529
00:28:55,951 --> 00:28:57,823
- And a billion times
better than

530
00:28:57,866 --> 00:28:59,781
Isabella Islay single malt.

531
00:28:59,825 --> 00:29:02,262
Look it up when you get back.
I'm staying.

532
00:29:02,305 --> 00:29:04,438
- You've got students
counting on you.

533
00:29:04,481 --> 00:29:05,918
- And I've had it with
the goddamn lot of them,

534
00:29:05,961 --> 00:29:07,746
all 40 timeline's worth.

535
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:09,269
I never really knew
how sick of them I was

536
00:29:09,312 --> 00:29:10,400
until I stopped drinking.

537
00:29:10,444 --> 00:29:12,925
I've earned the right
to step off

538
00:29:12,968 --> 00:29:15,144
and do Tai Chi with the Elvi.

539
00:29:16,842 --> 00:29:19,496
- I want this as much as you.

540
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,585
As soon as he tells you
where the depository is--

541
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:25,241
Sorry, Kady,
but you just revealed

542
00:29:25,285 --> 00:29:27,287
to the entire
studio audience

543
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:31,726
that you're hanging onto
a thread of responsible intent,

544
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,468
which could make you
kind of a bum hang

545
00:29:34,511 --> 00:29:35,774
in 100 years or so.

546
00:29:37,297 --> 00:29:39,690
Hank, on the other hand...

547
00:29:40,953 --> 00:29:43,912
Is laidback mondo perfectus.

548
00:29:43,956 --> 00:29:46,306
- Hey...

549
00:29:46,349 --> 00:29:48,221
you don't really want this.

550
00:29:48,264 --> 00:29:51,224
- Kady, sweet Kady.

551
00:29:51,267 --> 00:29:53,879
- I'm sorry I did this to you.

552
00:29:53,922 --> 00:29:55,837
I had no right.

553
00:29:55,881 --> 00:29:57,839
- My whole life,

554
00:29:57,883 --> 00:30:00,668
all this senseless worry,

555
00:30:00,711 --> 00:30:03,845
suffering and pain,

556
00:30:03,889 --> 00:30:07,806
both inflicted and received...

557
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:09,851
it wasn't for nothing.

558
00:30:09,895 --> 00:30:12,985
It guided me here.

559
00:30:13,028 --> 00:30:15,509
And you were right.

560
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:17,467
I am home.

561
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:25,824
- I'll be back, okay?

562
00:30:25,867 --> 00:30:27,651
I promise.

563
00:30:27,695 --> 00:30:29,828
- Goodie.
See you soon.

564
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:49,499
- Use your key.
Go.

565
00:30:49,543 --> 00:30:52,372
- I'm not going without you.
- I can't.

566
00:30:52,415 --> 00:30:54,896
- Do you really want to die
for a bunch of books?

567
00:30:56,811 --> 00:31:00,467
- If I could do it all again...

568
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:03,296
I'd be a better mother...

569
00:31:03,339 --> 00:31:05,298
a truer friend.

570
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,650
But I wasn't.

571
00:31:09,693 --> 00:31:10,869
I'm not.

572
00:31:12,348 --> 00:31:15,482
Because I've given
my life to this.

573
00:31:15,525 --> 00:31:19,747
It's all I am.
It's all I have.

574
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:21,575
I can't lose everything.

575
00:31:21,618 --> 00:31:22,750
- You can.

576
00:31:22,793 --> 00:31:24,665
Believe me, I have.

577
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,843
I'm sorry about Quentin...

578
00:31:30,453 --> 00:31:31,715
But this is different.

579
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:33,065
- No, it's not.

580
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,634
Because whoever,
whatever you love

581
00:31:37,678 --> 00:31:40,072
that gets ripped away from you,

582
00:31:40,115 --> 00:31:43,989
it stays alive
inside of us...

583
00:31:44,032 --> 00:31:46,078
and anyone
you share it with.

584
00:31:46,121 --> 00:31:48,776
- I can't.
I can't.

585
00:31:50,734 --> 00:31:53,433
I'm not strong enough.

586
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,742
- Stopping her signal
is impossible.

587
00:31:58,786 --> 00:32:00,657
It's coming from a place
that I can't reach,

588
00:32:00,701 --> 00:32:02,094
but I could save him.

589
00:32:02,137 --> 00:32:04,444
- Then do it now.

590
00:32:04,487 --> 00:32:06,794
- I'll just need you
to give me what we agreed to.

591
00:32:06,837 --> 00:32:08,013
- And the rest of it?

592
00:32:08,056 --> 00:32:09,753
- Rest of what?

593
00:32:09,797 --> 00:32:11,712
- The part where you save
the planet?

594
00:32:11,755 --> 00:32:14,933
- You have one thing to trade,
Julia, for one miracle.

595
00:32:14,976 --> 00:32:17,761
So your miracle can be
to save your boyfriend

596
00:32:17,805 --> 00:32:20,982
or your world.

597
00:32:21,026 --> 00:32:22,897
- But you could save both.

598
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,029
- You know what?

599
00:32:24,072 --> 00:32:25,726
Humans have exploited gods

600
00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:27,597
since you guys
staggered upright.

601
00:32:27,641 --> 00:32:30,122
The deals that we make
need to be strict.

602
00:32:30,165 --> 00:32:32,863
So this deal--
one book, one miracle.

603
00:32:32,907 --> 00:32:35,649
- You're really gonna
make me choose?

604
00:32:35,692 --> 00:32:37,738
The planet or him.
- Yeah.

605
00:32:37,781 --> 00:32:39,783
I know, it's
total bullshit, right?

606
00:32:39,827 --> 00:32:41,524
You see why I want to be
a human?

607
00:32:41,568 --> 00:32:43,744
Like, I can't feel the melodies
I'm goddess of,

608
00:32:43,787 --> 00:32:46,529
can't bend the rules
I didn't make...

609
00:32:46,573 --> 00:32:48,140
- Don't put this on your kind.

610
00:32:48,183 --> 00:32:50,490
This is you choosing.

611
00:32:50,533 --> 00:32:52,709
- But the one who has
to choose is you.

612
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:57,845
I'd say he has
about a minute left.

613
00:33:15,515 --> 00:33:17,343
- I feel...

614
00:33:18,692 --> 00:33:19,998
Better.

615
00:33:21,521 --> 00:33:24,176
So why do I feel like something
really shitty went down?

616
00:33:26,526 --> 00:33:28,310
Maybe because you're here.

617
00:33:28,354 --> 00:33:32,445
- Like all humans,
23 saw little and knew less.

618
00:33:32,488 --> 00:33:37,145
What strange, sad, angry,
narrow little lives

619
00:33:37,189 --> 00:33:39,321
these humans stumbled through.

620
00:33:39,365 --> 00:33:41,193
- Okay, just tell me
what you did to me.

621
00:33:41,236 --> 00:33:42,672
- I helped you,

622
00:33:42,716 --> 00:33:46,154
and now you're going
to help me.

623
00:33:46,198 --> 00:33:48,113
- The Binder
reminded the goddess,

624
00:33:48,156 --> 00:33:50,637
he couldn't be forced
to do anything

625
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,508
he didn't wish to.

626
00:33:52,552 --> 00:33:56,121
- Honey,
I don't force anyone.

627
00:33:56,164 --> 00:33:57,383
I just get what I want.

628
00:33:57,426 --> 00:33:59,037
Good-bye, Julia.

629
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,342
And for what it's worth,

630
00:34:00,386 --> 00:34:01,952
I feel like you made
the right decision.

631
00:34:01,996 --> 00:34:04,564
- For what it's worth,
go fuck yourself.

632
00:34:13,616 --> 00:34:15,183
That's all of them, sir.

633
00:34:15,227 --> 00:34:17,359
None harmed.

634
00:34:17,403 --> 00:34:18,621
We'll secure the site.

635
00:34:18,665 --> 00:34:20,406
You should go back
with the map makers.

636
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,154
- It kind of feels
a little abrupt, you know?

637
00:34:29,197 --> 00:34:30,720
It kind of felt like
he was gearing up

638
00:34:30,764 --> 00:34:31,982
to make a big speech.

639
00:34:32,026 --> 00:34:33,375
It was just...

640
00:34:33,419 --> 00:34:36,117
- Wait.

641
00:34:36,161 --> 00:34:38,380
Back inside, now.

642
00:34:38,424 --> 00:34:40,687
- Excuse me, sir, but wasn't
this a rescue mission?

643
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:44,256
A super-successful one
that's over?

644
00:34:44,299 --> 00:34:46,345
- Inside.

645
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:54,744
- So I-I take it she's
the god you summoned,

646
00:34:54,788 --> 00:34:58,444
who is not going
to save the world for us?

647
00:34:58,487 --> 00:35:00,576
- Look, we'll figure
something else out.

648
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,404
We've got time.

649
00:35:02,448 --> 00:35:04,145
- There's more, isn't there?

650
00:35:06,452 --> 00:35:08,584
- Anyone else need a drink?

651
00:35:11,196 --> 00:35:13,154
- Look, the signal
was killing you.

652
00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:15,287
I did what needed
to be done now,

653
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:17,550
but she didn't have time
to be delicate.

654
00:35:17,593 --> 00:35:20,248
She just--

655
00:35:20,292 --> 00:35:22,032
She said that
the only way was--

656
00:35:22,076 --> 00:35:24,600
- Take away
my psychic abilities.

657
00:35:26,689 --> 00:35:28,996
Yeah, 'cause...

658
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:34,523
I'm not getting
Merritt's signal anymore or...

659
00:35:36,699 --> 00:35:39,137
Anybody's thoughts here

660
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,443
or anywhere.

661
00:35:42,575 --> 00:35:44,316
Wow.

662
00:35:45,491 --> 00:35:47,319
So this is quiet.

663
00:35:49,277 --> 00:35:52,193
It is fucking weird.

664
00:35:52,237 --> 00:35:54,282
- You can't travel anymore.

665
00:35:54,326 --> 00:35:56,545
- Technically, I can.

666
00:35:56,589 --> 00:35:58,591
It'd just be like
flying a jet blind.

667
00:35:58,634 --> 00:36:00,810
And since I'm not suicidal, I--

668
00:36:00,854 --> 00:36:03,161
- I'm sorry, Penny.

669
00:36:03,204 --> 00:36:05,554
- No, we just settled a really
big spiritual argument here.

670
00:36:07,513 --> 00:36:10,385
There is for sure
instant karma.

671
00:36:10,429 --> 00:36:11,734
- If there had been
more time...

672
00:36:11,778 --> 00:36:13,301
- Come on.

673
00:36:13,345 --> 00:36:15,782
You got to appreciate
the balance of it...

674
00:36:15,825 --> 00:36:18,350
the irony.

675
00:36:18,393 --> 00:36:21,614
I had to make
a choice for you.

676
00:36:21,657 --> 00:36:25,183
You had to make
a choice for me

677
00:36:25,226 --> 00:36:28,229
It is fucking radiant.

678
00:36:28,273 --> 00:36:30,623
- Um...

679
00:36:32,364 --> 00:36:34,366
this...

680
00:36:34,409 --> 00:36:37,717
This...

681
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,675
this happened...

682
00:36:41,634 --> 00:36:44,419
This is because of me.

683
00:36:44,463 --> 00:36:45,812
I didn't see it coming,

684
00:36:45,855 --> 00:36:47,857
and I never thought
it was gonna get this bad.

685
00:36:47,901 --> 00:36:49,424
- Merritt,
what could you have done?

686
00:36:49,468 --> 00:36:51,252
I should've told the truth.

687
00:36:51,296 --> 00:36:55,125
My name,
my real name, is Plum.

688
00:36:57,258 --> 00:37:01,697
Plum Merritt Chatwin.

689
00:37:01,741 --> 00:37:04,874
- Wait.
- You're a Chatwin?

690
00:37:04,918 --> 00:37:06,876
- Wait, what do you mean?
Like the kid's books?

691
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,269
I missed an episode.

692
00:37:08,313 --> 00:37:10,880
- I am so sorry.

693
00:37:10,924 --> 00:37:13,883
I was terrified and alone,

694
00:37:13,927 --> 00:37:18,671
and being here was
the first time I felt safe,

695
00:37:18,714 --> 00:37:21,282
but I'm not.

696
00:37:21,326 --> 00:37:24,459
The thing with being a Chatwin
is it's like a curse.

697
00:37:24,503 --> 00:37:26,156
It's like there
are things coming after you

698
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,593
that we just don't understand.

699
00:37:27,636 --> 00:37:29,638
I don't know
what this signal is,

700
00:37:29,682 --> 00:37:31,292
but I know why it's
targeting me,

701
00:37:31,336 --> 00:37:32,641
and I am gonna figure out...

702
00:37:32,685 --> 00:37:33,903
- Whoa, whoa.
Hang on! Hang on!

703
00:37:33,947 --> 00:37:35,427
- No, you don't know
what that's gonna do.

704
00:37:39,909 --> 00:37:42,477
You're right.

705
00:37:42,521 --> 00:37:44,262
- Wha--

706
00:37:51,747 --> 00:37:53,314
- Funny thing

707
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:56,361
about doing the same thing
over and over again--

708
00:37:56,404 --> 00:37:58,406
you learn how to do it better.

709
00:37:59,929 --> 00:38:02,236
- I suppose that's the true
purpose of a library, no?

710
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,283
Your treasured tomes--

711
00:38:05,326 --> 00:38:08,590
each one a life...

712
00:38:08,634 --> 00:38:10,418
a destiny.

713
00:38:10,462 --> 00:38:13,421
- I'm most curious about who
my next few wives will be.

714
00:38:13,465 --> 00:38:16,337
You never know, Alice.

715
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,779
Let's go find our books,
shall we?

716
00:38:28,523 --> 00:38:30,395
Something to add,
Madam Librarian?

717
00:38:30,438 --> 00:38:33,441
- Yes, if you really want
to know your future,

718
00:38:33,485 --> 00:38:35,922
you better be able
to speed-read.

719
00:38:38,272 --> 00:38:39,969
- No!

720
00:38:40,013 --> 00:38:42,798
No, no!

721
00:38:42,842 --> 00:38:44,452
No, no, no, no, no!

722
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,347
- Enter.

723
00:39:24,927 --> 00:39:27,016
- I was just checking

724
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,062
to make sure
you were all right.

725
00:39:29,105 --> 00:39:31,804
- Thank you for your concern.

726
00:39:31,847 --> 00:39:33,371
I'm fine.

727
00:39:34,981 --> 00:39:37,244
Just a bit tired.

728
00:39:37,287 --> 00:39:40,290
- I can imagine.

729
00:39:42,292 --> 00:39:44,469
You were incredible out there.

730
00:39:44,512 --> 00:39:47,297
- Maybe once.

731
00:39:47,341 --> 00:39:49,735
Now it's, um...

732
00:39:49,778 --> 00:39:52,041
What's the military term?

733
00:39:52,085 --> 00:39:54,827
Holding action.

734
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:58,004
Nothing but holding actions.

735
00:39:58,047 --> 00:40:02,312
- I saw that not
all the Centurions returned.

736
00:40:10,103 --> 00:40:11,887
Good night, Seb.

737
00:40:19,242 --> 00:40:22,332
- What exactly are
we looking for, sir?

738
00:40:22,376 --> 00:40:24,509
- Not what.
Who.

739
00:40:24,552 --> 00:40:27,294
Well, both.

740
00:41:03,156 --> 00:41:04,200
- Grab it!
Grab it!

741
00:41:15,908 --> 00:41:18,476
- You two know each other?

742
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:19,781
- No.

743
00:41:22,305 --> 00:41:25,047
- Then you won't mind taking
charge of its imprisonment.

744
00:41:25,091 --> 00:41:27,093
- Of course not, sir.

745
00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:45,590
- And all the books
on everyone are gone...

746
00:41:45,633 --> 00:41:47,461
for good.

747
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,202
- Maybe that means
actual free will now

748
00:41:49,245 --> 00:41:52,901
and not any
of that predestined shit.

749
00:41:57,036 --> 00:41:59,342
- Or lots of rewrites to do.

750
00:41:59,386 --> 00:42:02,476
Sorry, Zelda.
It's a bad day for everybody.

751
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,044
- At least the fires
drove them out.

752
00:42:05,087 --> 00:42:07,089
We think they got
about half the collection.

753
00:42:07,133 --> 00:42:10,005
- Yep, and everything
on the Convergence.

754
00:42:10,049 --> 00:42:11,485
- So what do we now?

755
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,966
We try and trade
with the Visigoths?

756
00:42:14,009 --> 00:42:17,012
What do we have that they want?

757
00:42:17,056 --> 00:42:19,406
- I mean, the Overlord
kind of liked me.

758
00:42:19,449 --> 00:42:21,887
- Off the table.

759
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:24,629
- I read most of the books
on the Convergence...

760
00:42:24,672 --> 00:42:26,979
enough to know
it can be stopped.

761
00:42:27,022 --> 00:42:31,331
It's almost impossible
but not complicated.

762
00:42:35,509 --> 00:42:37,903
- Zelda, please tell.

763
00:42:37,946 --> 00:42:40,340
- Of course.

764
00:42:40,383 --> 00:42:45,171
Well, all you have to do
is move...

765
00:42:45,214 --> 00:42:46,912
that.

766
00:42:46,955 --> 00:42:48,609
- Move?

767
00:42:48,653 --> 00:42:51,003
- The fucking moon.

768
00:42:52,482 --> 00:42:54,615
Well, at least we know
where it is.
