1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,466
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,599
Your new lady Centurion.

3
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,720
You said you heard voices
from other worlds.

4
00:00:25,721 --> 00:00:27,110
You hearing something?

5
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:28,639
A signal?

6
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,200
Professor, did the
signal make you do that?

7
00:00:37,907 --> 00:00:39,956
He loved you.

8
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:42,251
Why would I want to take
that away from you now?

9
00:00:42,252 --> 00:00:45,179
That would be so cruel.

10
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,339
You really think I didn't
know there was more?

11
00:00:48,918 --> 00:00:51,217
What was I supposed to do, huh?

12
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:54,387
Demand that he only love me?

13
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,719
"Dark King" is a little generic

14
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,726
as villain names go, wouldn't you say?

15
00:00:58,727 --> 00:00:59,729
I have notes.

16
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,539
Although he is somewhat effective.

17
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,271
Everyone seems terrified of him.

18
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:05,982
Elliot, Taker! Back up!

19
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:13,569
You all right?

20
00:01:15,814 --> 00:01:18,200
Death is so simple...

21
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:20,372
and life is so complicated.

22
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,000
I know.

23
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,899
I think I almost fucked the Dark King.

24
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,256
Are you familiar with the
Harmonic Convergence?

25
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:33,390
A rare and powerful
astrological occurrence,

26
00:01:33,397 --> 00:01:34,802
a magnifier of magic.

27
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,263
- How bad will it be?
- Death toll in the millions.

28
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,140
- Maybe much higher.
- How can we stop it?

29
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:40,350
You can't.

30
00:01:42,562 --> 00:01:43,919
Lady!

31
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:48,441
Hedge witches... they're used to crumbs.

32
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:51,069
And, yes, ambient is low, but
you know what amplifies it?

33
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,239
Cooperative magic.

34
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,659
We tell everyone,

35
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,949
and we all do the same
thing at the same time.

36
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,039
And I thought that if
I took on more power

37
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,740
and more responsibility...

38
00:02:03,862 --> 00:02:05,582
that I would want heroin less.

39
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,319
When I thought I'd relapsed,

40
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,798
I was relieved.

41
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,959
So, uh...

42
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,429
I've been clean for a year.

43
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:27,299
Thanks, but uh, maybe hold that
'cause I've been jonesing hard.

44
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,359
Uh...

45
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,487
I'm a hedge.

46
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,850
You know, before we helped
save magic, we got a shit deal.

47
00:02:36,852 --> 00:02:38,029
Right?

48
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,199
Oh, there was, uh, a blood worm scare,

49
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,995
so the Library gave a lot
of hedges the Reed's Mark.

50
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:46,457
Well, get a mark, you're magically
castrated till they take it off.

51
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,211
The Library's imploding.
They can't fix it

52
00:02:49,212 --> 00:02:51,379
and the marked ones are
looking at me, like,

53
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:54,259
"Hey, bossy pants, you
rallied us to save magic.

54
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,699
How about saving us?"

55
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,830
And I found a spell to remove
the marks in a depository.

56
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:02,557
Only, all of a sudden, it's gone.

57
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:06,879
But I know, only way to
move something that warded

58
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,809
is to move it though the Etheric Realm.

59
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:12,276
Cool, I've heard it's awesome
there. What's the prob?

60
00:03:12,277 --> 00:03:16,239
The prob...

61
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,910
is there's only one way into the Realm.

62
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,240
Anybody heard of RCH?

63
00:03:23,787 --> 00:03:25,289
Nickname Archie?

64
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,259
Yep.

65
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,360
The way to save every marked
hedge is to drop acid.

66
00:03:36,955 --> 00:03:39,553
A true 12-step conundrum.

67
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,810
I'm assuming you have the Archie on you.

68
00:03:47,811 --> 00:03:50,359
Call your sponsor, kid.

69
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,489
It'd make sense...

70
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,359
in case somebody here,

71
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,821
you know, gave you permission
to jump off the wagon.

72
00:03:57,822 --> 00:03:59,759
Sorry, M.A. is so strict.

73
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,499
You met the nice me.

74
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,239
Here's the real me. Fuck off.

75
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,667
What?

76
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,179
Well, I take the anonymous part

77
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:19,560
of Magicians Anonymous very seriously.

78
00:04:19,563 --> 00:04:21,928
So you quit drinking.

79
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,959
33 days, 6 hours,
19 minutes of skin-peeling,

80
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,759
soul-searing hell ago, yes.

81
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,519
Well, I can relate.

82
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,599
As can I,

83
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,149
in regards to the crushing
weight of leadership.

84
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,140
I've never seen Archie.

85
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:41,820
May I?

86
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:46,829
Why two?

87
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,160
In case the first trip's a bust.

88
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,792
Or in case it's fun.

89
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,679
I've been dismissive

90
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,739
or downright derisive about hedges,

91
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,639
and I admit, I was quite wrong.

92
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,170
And I'd like to try and make, um...

93
00:05:04,173 --> 00:05:05,669
Oh, hell, what's the word?

94
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,180
- Amends.
- Yes.

95
00:05:14,662 --> 00:05:16,440
Are you crazy?

96
00:05:16,446 --> 00:05:19,986
I am, but I am not an addict.

97
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,569
I am an alcoholic. Totally different.

98
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,201
So I will go hunt down the depository.

99
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,699
You're not going alone.

100
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,718
- Synced & corrected by<font color="#E83286"> MementMori </font>-
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.addic7ed.com</font> --

101
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:46,379
So we know about the
Harmonic Convergence.

102
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,320
The problem is we knew
just enough to be useless.

103
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,739
So maybe we find someone
who can see the big picture.

104
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,890
"Find."

105
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:54,479
Summon.

106
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,482
A god?

107
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,119
Whoa, you've got to be kidding me!

108
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,559
Wait, Julia, before you do that,

109
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,447
- I think the Library might have...
- Ah.

110
00:06:03,448 --> 00:06:05,309
- Ooh.
- Penny?

111
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,670
I'm fine.

112
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:10,411
Wow, that is a whole
nother level. Jesus.

113
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:11,839
I thought the patch was working.

114
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,745
Merritt's signal just
keeps getting stronger.

115
00:06:13,746 --> 00:06:15,099
I'm sorry, I can't stay.

116
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,835
I'm... I'm just no use until
I get this under control.

117
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,004
Maybe do the summoning once I get back?

118
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:22,030
Uh, let me know if things get too weird.

119
00:06:22,033 --> 00:06:23,884
Uh, yeah, same.

120
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,260
The Library has summoned
me about 7,000 times

121
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,810
to come work there,

122
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,688
and they also gave me this.

123
00:06:38,223 --> 00:06:40,316
It'll get me in anytime I want.

124
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,180
I'll bring back whatever they have

125
00:06:42,184 --> 00:06:45,049
on their Harmonic Convergence
as fast as I can.

126
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,379
Are you sure you'll be okay?

127
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,990
Yeah. Good luck.

128
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,060
You too.

129
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,190
It makes the signal is
hitting you harder.

130
00:06:55,197 --> 00:06:56,779
I'm starting to actually hear...

131
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,160
A voice?

132
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,850
- You too?
- Kind of.

133
00:07:00,855 --> 00:07:02,850
I can't make out actual words,

134
00:07:02,857 --> 00:07:04,289
at least not ones I can understand.

135
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,249
- Is that for me?
- No.

136
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:08,769
The problem with the
first patch was that it

137
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,179
is just a deflector.

138
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,619
The signal is getting bounced off,

139
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,279
but I'm still getting hit by the reverb.

140
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,599
This one should absorb the sound

141
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,699
and kill it.

142
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,232
And if it does, we'll see
what we can gin up for you.

143
00:07:36,107 --> 00:07:38,149
Okay.

144
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,449
Better, I think.

145
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,280
Oh...

146
00:07:43,288 --> 00:07:44,919
Okay.

147
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,055
What was that?

148
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,510
- Where did you go?
- I don't remember.

149
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,779
You didn't blip out on purpose.

150
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,249
No, it's like when the pain
got so I was gonna pass out,

151
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,260
I just... I just went.

152
00:08:01,263 --> 00:08:02,941
You need a doctor.

153
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:13,117
I'm impressed.

154
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:15,319
Oh, not with this. It's dreadful.

155
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,360
Sorry.

156
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:19,499
With your skills as a Magician.

157
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,760
- Who trained you?
- Well, I just picked up

158
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,999
a little bit here and there.

159
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,099
Clearly not enough,

160
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,889
since I couldn't put a
scratch on that Taker.

161
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,959
Don't be modest.

162
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,093
You have what it takes
to be quite formidable.

163
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,636
I could use you.

164
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,556
Official Court Magician in
Defense of the Kingdom.

165
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:39,719
You could teach others
and be taught by me.

166
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,600
I would be honored...

167
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:45,484
Your Majesty.

168
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,640
Hmm.

169
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:55,280
A different lining perhaps.
Gray, please.

170
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:03,280
When we are alone,

171
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:05,169
it can be Seb.

172
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,338
Well, Seb,

173
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:09,965
we have a saying where I come from.

174
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,759
You kind of buried the lede on, uh...

175
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,759
on the... well, on you.

176
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,340
I didn't mean to deceive you.

177
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:24,040
Kings have to be very
careful about who to trust.

178
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:27,399
And also, it can be a relief to not...

179
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,693
Feel the weight of the crown
on your head every second?

180
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,399
You are wise.

181
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,740
But I knew that already.

182
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,009
In any case, settle in,

183
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,579
and we will get down to the particulars

184
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,959
of your duties later.

185
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,059
All right?

186
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,379
All right.

187
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,000
Your Majesty.

188
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:59,339
- Oh, please.
- What?

189
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,739
If you say his gorgeous
eyes see into your soul,

190
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,340
I'm gonna puke all over
your new leggings,

191
00:10:03,341 --> 00:10:05,120
which are quite sharp, by the way.

192
00:10:05,126 --> 00:10:06,379
Thank you.

193
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,599
- Legs for days.
- Ah, thank you.

194
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,179
But I never said his eyes were gorgeous

195
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,619
or that he sees into my soul.

196
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,339
But weirdly, he might.

197
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,999
Or he's sucking the soul out of you

198
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,449
because he doesn't have one.

199
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,019
Um, he did save my life.

200
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,239
He's called the Dark King.

201
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,999
You're called Margo the Destroyer.

202
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,739
I was a woman ruling a patriarchy,

203
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,125
my brand had to be overkill.

204
00:10:25,126 --> 00:10:27,970
Bottom line, he likes you.

205
00:10:27,975 --> 00:10:29,962
You just have to find out
what he's really about.

206
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,428
I'll see if my fellow
Centurions like to gossip.

207
00:10:36,429 --> 00:10:38,679
Then we regroup and decide...

208
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,560
benevolent dictator by necessity

209
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,469
or psychopathic despot by choice?

210
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,099
- What if he's the latter?
- Then I always got his back.

211
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,233
Perfect place to bury these.

212
00:11:33,388 --> 00:11:36,069
- Zelda.
- Help me, please.

213
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,112
What's going on? Who are they?

214
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,447
Visigoths.

215
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:39,866
What, like Marilyn Manson?

216
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:42,739
- Visi-goths!
- Oh, Germanic barbarians.

217
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,480
Who always show up at
the absolute worst points

218
00:11:44,486 --> 00:11:45,569
in history.

219
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,030
Fucking hell.

220
00:12:10,033 --> 00:12:12,649
Oh, sorry. Did you...
did you want Hades?

221
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,861
I could get word to him,
but, ugh, what a dick.

222
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,529
Are you...

223
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,779
I'm Clarion, Goddess of Melody.

224
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:25,119
Hey, Julia, I have, uh, had my
eye on you for quite a while.

225
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,662
- You have?
- Yeah, yeah.

226
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,019
So you were mortal, right?

227
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,416
And then you were one of us,
and now you're back to mortal.

228
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,126
Whew, you're one tough cookie, cookie.

229
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,579
- Thanks?
- Yeah,

230
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,760
but the way that you're imagining

231
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:38,839
the Harmonic Convergence
isn't quite enough.

232
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,173
It's so much worse.

233
00:12:40,174 --> 00:12:44,135
So, when all the spells cast by
all the Magicians go haywire,

234
00:12:44,136 --> 00:12:46,460
you're gonna get earthquakes, fire,

235
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,059
drought, starvation, plague.

236
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,969
And then comes cannibalism.

237
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:53,559
Um, is there anything you can do?

238
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,770
I could stop it.

239
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,318
- How would that be?
- Great.

240
00:12:57,319 --> 00:13:00,195
But I'm assuming there's
something you want in return.

241
00:13:02,694 --> 00:13:05,870
Yeah, you, uh...

242
00:13:05,872 --> 00:13:07,954
You have dealt with a god or two.

243
00:13:09,701 --> 00:13:11,123
Yep.

244
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,751
I want to be human.

245
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:16,170
Like you.

246
00:13:16,171 --> 00:13:18,172
Excuse me?

247
00:13:18,173 --> 00:13:21,801
I worship you, Julia.

248
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,599
How did you do it, though?

249
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,979
Because that's the part
that I couldn't quite see.

250
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,279
There's, like, some kind of cloak

251
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,475
around the whole process.

252
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:33,060
Uh, rumor is it had something
to do with a book.

253
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:36,989
Yeah, okay, I'm gonna need
just a few more details...

254
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,818
I don't know, starting with why.

255
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:40,739
Do I want to be human?

256
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,899
Oh, it's simple.

257
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,179
So I'm the Goddess of Melody, right?

258
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:47,640
But did you know that we
can't actually feel music?

259
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:50,909
Like, we understand it, we can
tell the good from the bad...

260
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,199
ah, sort of.

261
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,959
So you want to be human
so you can do karaoke?

262
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,960
I know that it sounds
like hubris itself,

263
00:13:59,969 --> 00:14:04,509
but, uh, I think I could be a rock star.

264
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,262
I mean, I pretty much know the gig,

265
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,839
right? They all prayed to me.

266
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,265
Except for Amy Winehouse, okay?

267
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,142
Look how that one
turned out. Poor thing.

268
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:13,760
Any other questions?

269
00:14:13,765 --> 00:14:15,270
Oh, boy.

270
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,846
This is amazing.

271
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,103
Careful!

272
00:14:55,104 --> 00:14:56,229
Whoa!

273
00:14:58,071 --> 00:14:59,857
The world isn't quite gone.

274
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,859
Oh...

275
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,720
this is what my neck feels like.

276
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,749
Come on! The depository.

277
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,789
Come on.

278
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,079
Hmm.

279
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:37,686
- Welcome!
- H-hi.

280
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:39,679
Oh! Oh!

281
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,939
We're looking for a depository
that was, um... it was over there.

282
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,439
Eat up.

283
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,079
Yeah, in a sec, but, uh,

284
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,781
if you know where the depository is...

285
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,279
Nobody knows where
anything is in the Realm,

286
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,570
except for the Emperor.

287
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:54,869
Dear God.

288
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,829
This is strange.

289
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,999
It tastes like, uh...

290
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,710
burning charcoal,

291
00:16:02,712 --> 00:16:05,319
hamburgers on a grill.

292
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,885
Popsicles.

293
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,309
Is that bunny staring at us?

294
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,728
Summer at the beach.

295
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,140
Brown bunny.

296
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,441
Sunglasses.

297
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:26,149
Beach clue.

298
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,399
I'm trying real hard to give a shit,

299
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,156
but it just feels so
good to be high again.

300
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:32,366
- Hmm.
- Oh.

301
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:34,910
I guess we follow him.

302
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:38,239
So we all know the threat we're facing.

303
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,559
These are Fillory's second
greatest protectors

304
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,709
against the Takers.

305
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,779
Who can tell me the first?

306
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,709
His Majesty, the Dark King.

307
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,819
Which is why protecting him

308
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,883
is the most important
job in the kingdom.

309
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:52,419
His Majesty is immortal, yes,

310
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,519
but he is not invulnerable.

311
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,050
Which makes us?

312
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:59,602
Expendable.

313
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,279
A group of royal map makers

314
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,983
won't make it back here till after dark.

315
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,359
And the First Cohort is
trapped in a blizzard

316
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,609
in Madness Plains.

317
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,499
You wet-nosed whelps are all we've got.

318
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,035
Well, you, me...

319
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,497
And our glorious leader.

320
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,599
What are we looking at here?

321
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,260
His Majesty wants the
kingdom to witness him

322
00:17:28,264 --> 00:17:30,259
saving subjects from the Takers.

323
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,699
These are in almost every
room of the castle,

324
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,261
most of the taverns, and...

325
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,119
It's fucking Fox News.

326
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,059
Foxes all lie. Who'd ever
believe their news?

327
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,559
His Majesty, I'm afraid all we
have are the newest recruits.

328
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,529
Who'll learn by doing.

329
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,899
Yes, sir. With me, recruits.

330
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,719
On three.

331
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,380
Quick step now.

332
00:17:58,381 --> 00:18:00,250
Ready, hup.

333
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,999
Give me a phaser and a red shirt.

334
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,280
- What?
- Yeah, just don't.

335
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:16,310
Whoa.

336
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,349
The Binder was annoyed...

337
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:26,039
but unsurprised Julia had failed

338
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,856
to burn him out of existence,

339
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:30,769
per their agreement.

340
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:33,946
Look, I just thought maybe
we were both a little hasty

341
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:37,160
and, I don't know,
maybe I'd keep you safe,

342
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,659
let us both cool down.

343
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,619
So can you do it?

344
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,209
The Binder stared at Julia...

345
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,779
wondering if she'd learned nothing

346
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,543
from her interactions with deities.

347
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:50,279
I don't have a lot of choice here, okay?

348
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,519
If you can't do this,
the Earth is doomed.

349
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,039
Hmm, "Again?"

350
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,549
The Binder asked... bored.

351
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:01,219
Still, the Binder wondered,

352
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:06,529
"Why on Earth would Julia
trust this 'Clarion'?"

353
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:10,139
I don't, but the options
here are narrowing.

354
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:14,479
As a book, the Binder enjoyed
any opportunity to teach.

355
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,019
And here was a word

356
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,539
Julia needed desperately
to understand...

357
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,744
No.

358
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,299
So are these the same Visigoths

359
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,160
that raided cultural
strongholds on Earth?

360
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,119
Mm, burned the Library of Alexandria,

361
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,950
sacked the statuary of Ancient Greece,

362
00:19:31,953 --> 00:19:34,339
burned Rome, London, Paris, Chicago,

363
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,669
where they framed poor
Mrs. O'Leary's cow.

364
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:38,379
That's around the time
they started getting bored

365
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,843
and moved into the multiverse.

366
00:19:39,844 --> 00:19:41,399
Okay, I'm sorry about all this,

367
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,760
but I need every book you have

368
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:44,099
on the Harmonic Convergence.

369
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,789
We have a vast collection on
the other side of that door.

370
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,760
Oh, wow. Well, my timing is...

371
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,189
How do you do?

372
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:01,029
I'm Visigoth Overlord Terence.

373
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,599
Apologies for the mess,

374
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,550
but recall, I did announce our incursion

375
00:20:05,552 --> 00:20:07,330
and asked you most politely

376
00:20:07,336 --> 00:20:09,249
to drop all your defenses and surrender,

377
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,470
having given my word

378
00:20:11,471 --> 00:20:13,754
that you would be absolutely safe.

379
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:16,289
But the word of a barbarian?

380
00:20:16,290 --> 00:20:18,239
Actually, Visigoths are famous

381
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,780
for always keeping their word.

382
00:20:19,783 --> 00:20:21,799
Oh, that's weird.

383
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,089
My dear, if you'd be so kind.

384
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,160
Sorry, I'm just a little confused here,

385
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,830
but you seem...

386
00:20:29,837 --> 00:20:32,389
Educated? Polite to a fault?

387
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:35,839
We seek to acquire only
the deepest knowledge,

388
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,799
highest art, and most
illuminating philosophy.

389
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,879
Is it any wonder a little might rub off?

390
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,839
What about all those
inconvenient commandments

391
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,702
- about theft?
- Alice, it's no use debating.

392
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,549
Alice, is it?

393
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,039
That's lovely.

394
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,099
Thank you?

395
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:54,119
We seek only those works that
transcend appetite and avarice,

396
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,629
that touch upon the immutable.

397
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:59,249
That's why we spend so little
time on Earth anymore.

398
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,699
What's left to raid?

399
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,739
Tent pole franchises?

400
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:08,349
Jeff Koons? The, um... hoodie?

401
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,459
Visigoths never lie,

402
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:12,062
but they never tell the
whole truth either.

403
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,731
I know what you're really after.

404
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,979
The books of everyone...

405
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,288
Is actually what they want.

406
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,489
Every sentient being's
life, birth to death.

407
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,500
Can you imagine?

408
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,418
They could plan the pillaging
of every great work

409
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:36,834
before it's painted or written.

410
00:21:36,835 --> 00:21:38,819
Not to mention the stock market.

411
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,380
"Stock market"?

412
00:21:40,386 --> 00:21:41,560
They have a thing about shorting.

413
00:21:41,561 --> 00:21:42,884
They think it's hilarious.

414
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:44,819
Look, Zelda, I understand
how important this is to you,

415
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,460
but what's the point?
They're gonna get in here,

416
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,909
and this is the only door.

417
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:51,090
Okay, how about this?

418
00:21:51,092 --> 00:21:53,469
You want to teach? Teach.

419
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,219
"You?

420
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,279
To turn a goddess mortal?"

421
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,319
The Binder inquired, with not
a small amount of disdain.

422
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,790
Hmm.

423
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,670
Too tough?

424
00:22:04,671 --> 00:22:06,970
Fine.

425
00:22:06,977 --> 00:22:08,890
Maybe I'll just hand you to her.

426
00:22:08,892 --> 00:22:12,369
Ah, the Binder realized
Julia had cornered him

427
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,416
with his own credo.

428
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,409
But still, he wondered,

429
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:18,920
what was in it for him?

430
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:21,674
Well, how's this, paper boy?

431
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,919
Said the Binder...

432
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,223
"Let the lessons commence."

433
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,799
Whoa!

434
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,890
Oh, oh...

435
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,829
Socks?

436
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:01,379
None of them match.

437
00:23:07,473 --> 00:23:10,470
So this is where they go.

438
00:23:11,825 --> 00:23:13,910
If you see a red and orange argyle,

439
00:23:13,914 --> 00:23:16,000
cashmere, size 13,

440
00:23:16,003 --> 00:23:17,389
grab it, please.

441
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:18,799
Oh.

442
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,740
I don't usually say this
when I'm this high,

443
00:23:21,748 --> 00:23:24,069
but we really need to focus.

444
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,660
Exactly. Red and orange.

445
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:28,180
Yeah.

446
00:23:28,189 --> 00:23:31,529
- No, no, we're looking for, uh...
- Christ!

447
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:32,540
Uh...

448
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:35,190
I don't believe it. There it is.

449
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:39,500
Oh!

450
00:23:39,505 --> 00:23:43,088
You were right. Just needed to focus.

451
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,980
Mmm...

452
00:23:44,988 --> 00:23:46,839
Oh, bunny. Bunny.

453
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:53,010
Oh.

454
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:56,820
Um, hi.

455
00:23:56,826 --> 00:23:58,870
Uh...

456
00:23:58,872 --> 00:24:01,229
we're looking for an emperor.

457
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,799
Hey, Kady.

458
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,150
Hank.

459
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,899
Hank. I don't hate that.

460
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,239
You know us?

461
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,449
What kind of an emp
would I be if I didn't?

462
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:15,999
You roll into my town,

463
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,699
I take a gander at your thoughts,

464
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,167
and if I dig ya, I show
you the brown bunny.

465
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:23,003
And I dig ya both.

466
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:25,547
Congratulations on the first sock.

467
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:29,759
How great is Archie, by the way?

468
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,513
Pretty great, once you let it settle in.

469
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:36,120
And as long as you're here,

470
00:24:36,126 --> 00:24:38,309
the high never goes away.

471
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,063
Wow. That's, uh...

472
00:24:42,064 --> 00:24:43,356
- That's perfect.
- Yeah.

473
00:24:43,357 --> 00:24:46,570
We... we really need to find the, uh...

474
00:24:46,572 --> 00:24:49,649
Oh, Jesus. The... the...

475
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,379
Depository, Kady.

476
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,460
Right, right.

477
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:54,951
Uh, can you tell us where that is now?

478
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,359
Sure can.

479
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,700
It won't be free, though.

480
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,379
Even here where everything's fun,

481
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,580
there's a price.

482
00:25:04,241 --> 00:25:07,069
Sit. Have some suds.

483
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,499
This'll take a sec.

484
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,580
What will?

485
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,090
For me to dig deeper into your thoughts,

486
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:16,890
see which one of you gets to leave...

487
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:19,120
and who has to stay.

488
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,640
Mmm...

489
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:35,200
The map makers are in there.

490
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:39,580
Do you hear that?

491
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:44,626
Oh, boy.

492
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:46,829
Breathing.

493
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,505
Coming from there.

494
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:52,008
With respect, Majesty, there.

495
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:54,159
Guys, there.

496
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:57,419
There, there. We're surrounded.

497
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,515
You can see them?

498
00:25:58,516 --> 00:26:00,079
I have really good night vision.

499
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,080
My grandpa married a snow leopard,

500
00:26:02,082 --> 00:26:03,353
is the rumor.

501
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:05,438
Sire.

502
00:26:07,817 --> 00:26:09,568
Where is he going?

503
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,699
Oh, I've seen that before.

504
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:17,200
It's a legit royal tactic. Never fear.

505
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,479
Shouldn't we get him to the infirmary?

506
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,659
With all the newbies
practicing during surges,

507
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,167
it's like a meat locker down there

508
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:28,879
where the meat's alive...
until it's not.

509
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,210
Ah!

510
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:32,508
Penny?

511
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:36,969
Get... Julia.

512
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:37,980
Who?

513
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,139
So our Dark King...

514
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,700
did he just shit the doublet?

515
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,519
I hope so.

516
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,180
I really don't want to be the
only one who does it with...

517
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:06,179
That's amazing, right?

518
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:09,019
I mean, honestly, fuck Netflix.

519
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,420
That is peak television.

520
00:28:10,427 --> 00:28:12,360
Jesus.

521
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,479
No kidding.

522
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,360
You kick some serious
ass for your kingdom.

523
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,212
Pretty cool.

524
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:36,450
You're both equally awesome,

525
00:28:36,453 --> 00:28:39,279
by which I mean, totally fucked up.

526
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,039
By which I mean, I get
you're on a mission.

527
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,346
One of you has got to jet,

528
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:46,850
but either one of you
can hang for eternity.

529
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:49,999
You guys decide.

530
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,855
- I'll stay.
- No, you will not.

531
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:53,898
Are you kidding?

532
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:55,949
This place is heroin heaven.

533
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,679
And a billion times better than

534
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,719
Isabella Islay single malt.

535
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,079
Look it up when you
get back. I'm staying.

536
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,139
You've got students counting on you.

537
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,879
And I've had it with the
goddamn lot of them,

538
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,599
all 40 timeline's worth.

539
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,139
I never really knew
how sick of them I was

540
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,290
until I stopped drinking.

541
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:12,960
I've earned the right to step off

542
00:29:12,968 --> 00:29:15,129
and do Tai Chi with the Elvi.

543
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,259
I want this as much as you.

544
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,551
As soon as he tells you
where the depository is...

545
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,939
Sorry, Kady, but you just revealed

546
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,049
to the entire studio audience

547
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:31,699
that you're hanging onto a
thread of responsible intent,

548
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:34,510
which could make you kind of a bum hang

549
00:29:34,511 --> 00:29:35,899
in 100 years or so.

550
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,820
Hank, on the other hand... Mm!

551
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:43,990
Is laidback mondo perfectus.

552
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:46,339
Hey...

553
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:48,479
you don't really want this.

554
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,059
Kady, sweet Kady.

555
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,640
I'm sorry I did this to you.

556
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:55,169
I had no right.

557
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,819
My whole life,

558
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,710
all this senseless worry,

559
00:30:00,711 --> 00:30:03,879
suffering and pain,

560
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,739
both inflicted and received...

561
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,890
it wasn't for nothing.

562
00:30:09,895 --> 00:30:13,020
It guided me here.

563
00:30:13,028 --> 00:30:15,550
And you were right.

564
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:17,398
I am home.

565
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:25,860
I'll be back, okay?

566
00:30:25,867 --> 00:30:27,575
I promise.

567
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:29,995
Goodie. See you soon.

568
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,630
_

569
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:49,299
Use your key. Go.

570
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,179
I'm not going without you.

571
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,189
I can't.

572
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:54,894
Do you really want to die
for a bunch of books?

573
00:30:56,811 --> 00:31:00,509
If I could do it all again...

574
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:03,330
I'd be a better mother...

575
00:31:03,339 --> 00:31:05,322
a truer friend.

576
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,690
But I wasn't.

577
00:31:09,693 --> 00:31:10,994
I'm not.

578
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:15,320
Because I've given my life to this.

579
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:19,539
It's all I am. It's all I have.

580
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,610
I can't lose everything.

581
00:31:21,618 --> 00:31:24,700
You can. Believe me, I have.

582
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:29,180
I'm sorry about Quentin...

583
00:31:30,453 --> 00:31:31,699
But this is different.

584
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,182
No, it's not.

585
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,659
Because whoever,

586
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:40,139
whatever you love that
gets ripped away from you,

587
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:43,519
it stays alive inside of us...

588
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,120
and anyone you share it with.

589
00:31:46,121 --> 00:31:48,809
I can't. I can't.

590
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,369
I'm not strong enough.

591
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,659
Stopping her signal is impossible.

592
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,626
It's coming from a place
that I can't reach,

593
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:02,211
but I could save him.

594
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:04,213
Then do it now.

595
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:06,739
I'll just need you to give
me what we agreed to.

596
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:09,094
- And the rest of it?
- Rest of what?

597
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:11,512
The part where you save the planet?

598
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:14,969
You have one thing to trade,
Julia, for one miracle.

599
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,760
So your miracle can be

600
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:20,938
to save your boyfriend or your world.

601
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,940
But you could save both.

602
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,070
You know what?

603
00:32:24,072 --> 00:32:25,611
Humans have exploited gods

604
00:32:25,612 --> 00:32:27,519
since you guys staggered upright.

605
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,160
The deals that we make
need to be strict.

606
00:32:30,165 --> 00:32:32,779
So this deal... one book, one miracle.

607
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:35,599
You're really gonna make me choose?

608
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,622
- The planet or him.
- Yeah.

609
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:39,707
I know, it's total bullshit, right?

610
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,292
You see why I want to be a human?

611
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,799
Like, I can't feel the
melodies I'm goddess of,

612
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,570
can't bend the rules
I didn't make, eh...

613
00:32:46,573 --> 00:32:48,257
Don't put this on your kind.

614
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:50,299
This is you choosing.

615
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:54,014
But the one who has to choose is you.

616
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:57,849
I'd say he has about a minute left.

617
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:18,539
I feel...

618
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,040
better.

619
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,740
So why do I feel like something
really shitty went down?

620
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,699
Maybe because you're here.

621
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:32,100
Like all humans, 23 saw
little and knew less.

622
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:37,056
What strange, sad, angry,
narrow little lives

623
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:39,183
these humans stumbled through.

624
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:41,230
Okay, just tell me what you did to me.

625
00:33:41,236 --> 00:33:42,709
I helped you,

626
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:46,019
and now you're going to help me.

627
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,984
The Binder reminded the goddess,

628
00:33:47,985 --> 00:33:50,679
he couldn't be forced to do anything

629
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,529
he didn't wish to.

630
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,959
Oh, honey, I don't force anyone.

631
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,452
I just get what I want.

632
00:33:57,453 --> 00:33:59,219
Good-bye, Julia.

633
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,990
And for what it's worth, I feel
like you made the right decision.

634
00:34:01,996 --> 00:34:04,667
For what it's worth, go fuck yourself.

635
00:34:13,616 --> 00:34:15,261
That's all of them, sir.

636
00:34:15,262 --> 00:34:17,379
None harmed.

637
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:18,979
We'll secure the site.

638
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,540
You should go back with the map makers.

639
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,189
It kind of feels a
little abrupt, you know?

640
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,319
It kind of felt like he was gearing up

641
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,540
to make a big speech.

642
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,446
It was just...

643
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:36,160
Wait.

644
00:34:36,161 --> 00:34:38,242
Back inside, now.

645
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,729
Excuse me, sir, but wasn't
this a rescue mission?

646
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:44,289
A super-successful one that's over?

647
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,829
Inside.

648
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:54,780
So I-I take it she's
the god you summoned,

649
00:34:54,788 --> 00:34:58,387
who is not going to
save the world for us?

650
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:00,619
Look, we'll figure something else out.

651
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,889
We've got time.

652
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:05,354
There's more, isn't there?

653
00:35:06,452 --> 00:35:08,730
Anyone else need a drink?

654
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,979
Look, the signal was killing you.

655
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,689
I did what needed to be done now,

656
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:17,699
but she didn't have time to be delicate.

657
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,289
She just...

658
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:21,819
She said that the only way was...

659
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,750
Take away my psychic abilities.

660
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:30,019
Yeah, 'cause...

661
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:34,670
I'm not getting Merritt's
signal anymore or...

662
00:35:36,699 --> 00:35:39,095
Anybody's thoughts here

663
00:35:39,096 --> 00:35:41,590
or anywhere.

664
00:35:42,575 --> 00:35:44,393
Wow.

665
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,560
So this is quiet.

666
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,100
It is fucking weird.

667
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:54,319
You can't travel anymore.

668
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,819
Technically, I can.

669
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,569
It'd just be like flying a jet blind.

670
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:01,149
And since I'm not suicidal, I...

671
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,899
- I'm sorry, Penny.
- No,

672
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:06,360
we just settled a really big
spiritual argument here.

673
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,543
There is for sure instant karma.

674
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,770
If there had been more time...

675
00:36:11,778 --> 00:36:13,170
Come on.

676
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,881
You got to appreciate
the balance of it...

677
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:18,259
the irony.

678
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,650
I had to make a choice for you.

679
00:36:21,657 --> 00:36:25,220
You had to make a choice for me

680
00:36:25,226 --> 00:36:28,227
It is fucking radiant.

681
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:30,399
Um...

682
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,239
Uh...

683
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,316
this...

684
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:37,759
This, oh, uh...

685
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,220
this happened...

686
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,439
This is because of me.

687
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,519
I didn't see it coming,

688
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,900
and I never thought it
was gonna get this bad.

689
00:36:47,901 --> 00:36:49,373
Merritt, what could you have done?

690
00:36:49,374 --> 00:36:51,126
I should've told the truth.

691
00:36:51,127 --> 00:36:55,380
My name, my real name, is Plum.

692
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:01,719
Plum Merritt Chatwin.

693
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,799
- Wait.
- You're a Chatwin?

694
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,475
Wait, what do you mean?
Like the kid's books?

695
00:37:06,476 --> 00:37:08,225
I missed an episode.

696
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,920
I am so sorry.

697
00:37:10,924 --> 00:37:13,856
I was terrified and alone,

698
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:18,729
and being here was the
first time I felt safe,

699
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:21,039
but I'm not.

700
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,279
The thing with being a
Chatwin is it's like a curse.

701
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,060
It's like there are
things coming after you

702
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,630
that we just don't understand.

703
00:37:27,636 --> 00:37:29,680
I don't know what this signal is,

704
00:37:29,682 --> 00:37:31,163
but I know why it's targeting me,

705
00:37:31,164 --> 00:37:32,339
and I am gonna figure out...

706
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,940
- Whoa, whoa. Hang on! Hang on!
- ... how to fix it.

707
00:37:33,947 --> 00:37:35,547
No, you don't know what that's gonna do.

708
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,593
You're right.

709
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:44,410
Wha...

710
00:37:51,747 --> 00:37:53,099
Funny thing

711
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:56,260
about doing the same thing
over and over again...

712
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:58,399
you learn how to do it better.

713
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,110
I suppose that's the true
purpose of a library, no?

714
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,199
Ah, your treasured tomes...

715
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,529
each one a life...

716
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:10,199
a destiny.

717
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,374
I'm most curious about who
my next few wives will be.

718
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:16,335
You never know, Alice.

719
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,839
Let's go find our books, shall we?

720
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,279
Something to add, Madam Librarian?

721
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,799
Yes, if you really want
to know your future,

722
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,021
you better be able to speed-read.

723
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,479
No!

724
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,840
No, no!

725
00:38:42,842 --> 00:38:44,490
No, no, no, no, no!

726
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,556
Enter.

727
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,719
I was just checking

728
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,100
to make sure you were all right.

729
00:39:29,105 --> 00:39:31,840
Thank you for your concern.

730
00:39:31,847 --> 00:39:33,520
I'm fine.

731
00:39:34,981 --> 00:39:37,280
Just a bit tired.

732
00:39:37,287 --> 00:39:40,330
I can imagine.

733
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:44,049
You were incredible out there.

734
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:47,339
Maybe once.

735
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:49,499
Now it's, um...

736
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,080
What's the military term?

737
00:39:52,085 --> 00:39:54,475
Holding action.

738
00:39:54,476 --> 00:39:57,853
Nothing but holding actions.

739
00:39:57,854 --> 00:40:02,442
I saw that not all the
Centurions returned.

740
00:40:10,103 --> 00:40:11,952
Good night, Seb.

741
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,080
What exactly are we looking for, sir?

742
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,630
Not what. Who.

743
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:27,299
Well, both.

744
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:04,211
Grab it! Grab it!

745
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,640
You two know each other?

746
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:19,769
No.

747
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,959
Then you won't mind taking
charge of its imprisonment.

748
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,130
Of course not, sir.

749
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,629
And all the books on
everyone are gone...

750
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,119
for good.

751
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,089
Maybe that means actual free will now

752
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:52,801
and not any of that predestined shit.

753
00:41:57,036 --> 00:41:59,380
Or lots of rewrites to do.

754
00:41:59,386 --> 00:42:02,389
Sorry, Zelda. It's a
bad day for everybody.

755
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:04,819
At least the fires drove them out.

756
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:06,899
We think they got about
half the collection.

757
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,999
Mm, yep, and everything
on the Convergence.

758
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,100
So what do we now?

759
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:13,799
We try and trade with the Visigoths?

760
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,050
What do we have that they want?

761
00:42:17,056 --> 00:42:19,439
I mean, the Overlord kind of liked me.

762
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,799
Off the table.

763
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,625
I read most of the books
on the Convergence...

764
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:26,753
enough to know it can be stopped.

765
00:42:26,754 --> 00:42:31,999
It's almost impossible
but not complicated.

766
00:42:35,509 --> 00:42:37,846
Zelda, please tell.

767
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:40,380
Oh, of course.

768
00:42:40,383 --> 00:42:45,519
Well, all you have to do is move...

769
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,889
that.

770
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:48,540
Move?

771
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:51,039
The fucking moon.

772
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,760
Well, at least we know where it is.
