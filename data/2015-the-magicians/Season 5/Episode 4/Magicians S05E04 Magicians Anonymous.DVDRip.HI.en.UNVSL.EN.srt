Well, there was a

so the Library gave a lot
of Hedges the Reed's Mark.

Get a mark, you're magically
castrated until they take it off.

And the Library's
imploding, they can't fix it,

54

are looking at me like,

is there's only one

And I never said his eyes were
gorgeous or that he sees into my soul.

184
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:08,373
But weirdly, he might.

185
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,377

you because he doesn't have one.

what he's really about.

here are narrowing.

00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:07,192
But I wasn't. I'm not.

524
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,131
Because I've
given my life to this.

525
00:31:12,037 --> 00:31:15,030
It's all I am. It's all I have.

526
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:18,871
I can't lose everything.

527
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:20,972
You can. Believe me, I have.

528
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:25,184
I'm sorry about Quentin.

529
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:29,754
But this is
different. No, it's not.

530
00:31:31,423 --> 00:31:36,054
Because whoever, whatever you
love that gets ripped away from you,

531
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:40,093
it stays alive, inside of us.

532
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:42,557
And anyone you share it with.

533
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,393
I can't. I can't.

534
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,867
I'm not strong enough. (SOBS)

535
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,356
CLARION: Stopping
her signal is impossible.

536
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,212
It's coming from a
place that I can't reach.

537
00:31:57,716 --> 00:32:00,777
But I could save
him. Then do it. Now.

538
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,300
I'll just need you to give
me what we agreed to.

539
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:05,624
And the rest of
it? Rest of what?

540
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:08,086
The part where
you save the planet.

541
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:11,558
You have one thing to
trade, Julia, for one miracle.

542
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:17,466
So, your miracle can be to
save your boyfriend or your world.

543
00:32:17,803 --> 00:32:19,135
But you could save both.

544
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:24,039
You know what? Humans have exploited
gods since you guys staggered upright.

545
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:26,839
The deals that we
make need to be strict.

546
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,141
So this deal, one
book, one miracle.

547
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:31,579
You're really gonna
make me choose?

548
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:33,579
The planet or him?

549
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:36,280
Yeah. I know. It's
total bullshit, right?

550
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:37,822
You see why I want to be human?

551
00:32:37,923 --> 00:32:41,985
I can't feel the melodies I'm goddess of,
can't bend the rules I didn't make. Eh...

552
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:44,823
Don't put this on your kind.

553
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,822
This is you, choosing.

554
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:49,327
But the one who
has to choose is you.

555
00:32:52,771 --> 00:32:54,433
I'd say he has
about a minute left.

556
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:14,253
I feel

557
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,155
better.

558
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,197
So why do I feel like something
really shitty went down?

559
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:24,795
Maybe because you're here.

560
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:26,532
Like all humans.

561
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,201
23 saw little and knew less.

562
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:31,339
What strange, sad,

563
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:36,281
angry, narrow, little lives
these humans stumbled through.

564
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:39,382
Okay, just tell me what
you did to me. I helped you.

565
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,544
And now, you're
going to help me.

566
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:45,047
The Binder reminded the goddess

567
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:49,594
he couldn't be forced to
do anything he didn't wish to.

568
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,028
Aw.

569
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:52,663
Honey, I don't force anyone.

570
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:54,560
I just get what I want.

571
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,527
Goodbye, Julia.

572
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:59,161
And for what it's worth, I feel
like you made the right decision.

573
00:33:59,204 --> 00:34:01,730
For what it's worth,
go fuck yourself.

574
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,035
(CHUCKLES)

575
00:34:11,016 --> 00:34:13,747
That's all of them,
sir. None harmed.

576
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:17,580
We'll secure the site. You should
go back with the Map Makers.

577
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:25,763
Kind of feels a little abrupt.

578
00:34:25,864 --> 00:34:28,595
You know? I kinda felt like he was
gearing up to make a big speech,

579
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,032
and it's just...

580
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:32,329
Wait.

581
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:35,063
Back inside. Now.

582
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:37,740
Excuse me, sir, but wasn't
this a rescue mission?

583
00:34:37,976 --> 00:34:41,413
A super-successful
one? That's over?

584
00:34:41,947 --> 00:34:43,108
Inside.

585
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:52,052
So, I... I take it she's
the god you summoned?

586
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:55,523
Who is not going to
save the world for us?

587
00:34:56,061 --> 00:34:57,541
Look, we'll figure
something else out.

588
00:34:57,963 --> 00:34:58,963
We've got time.

589
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:00,998
There's more, isn't there?

590
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,298
Anyone else need a drink?

591
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:11,799
Look, the signal was killing you. I
did what needed to be done now.

592
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:15,370
But she didn't have time
to be delicate. She just...

593
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,141
She said that the
only way was...

594
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,116
Take away my psychic abilities.

595
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:25,780
Yeah, 'cause

596
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:30,759
I'm not getting
Merritt's signal anymore.

597
00:35:34,265 --> 00:35:36,200
Or anybody's thoughts here

598
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,293
or anywhere.

599
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,306
So this is quiet.

600
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:48,576
It is fucking weird.

601
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,942
You can't travel anymore.

602
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:52,948
Technically, I can.

603
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:55,680
It'd just be like
flying a jet blind.

604
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:58,319
And since I'm not suicidal, I...

605
00:35:58,423 --> 00:35:59,618
I'm sorry, Penny.

606
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:02,786
No. We just settled a really
big spiritual argument here.

607
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:06,196
There is for sure instant karma.

608
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,228
If there had been
more time... Come on.

609
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:14,033
You can appreciate the
balance of it, the irony.

610
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,136
I had to make a choice for you,

611
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,469
you had to make a choice for me.

612
00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:24,613
It is fucking radiant.

613
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:26,676
BOTH: Um...

614
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:30,688
MERRITT: This...

615
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:36,728
So, uh, this happened...

616
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:40,657
This is because of me.

617
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:44,931
I didn't see it coming and I never
thought it was gonna get this bad.

618
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,402
Merritt, what could
you have done?

619
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,234
I should've told you the truth.

620
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:52,235
My name, my real name, is Plum.

621
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:57,815
(CLICKS TONGUE)
Plum Merritt Chatwin.

622
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:01,884
Wait. What? You're a Chatwin?

623
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:03,713
Wait. What do you mean?
Like the kids' books?

624
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:05,414
I missed an episode.

625
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,415
I am so sorry.

626
00:37:08,093 --> 00:37:10,961
I was terrified and alone,

627
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:15,690
and being here was
the first time I felt safe.

628
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:17,595
But I'm not.

629
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:21,296
The thing with being a
Chatwin is, it's like a curse.

630
00:37:21,506 --> 00:37:24,704
It's like there are things coming
after you you just don't understand.

631
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:28,235
I don't know what this signal is,
but I know why it's targeting me.

632
00:37:28,313 --> 00:37:31,147
And I'm gonna figure out how
to fix it. Whoa! Hang on. Hang on.

633
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:32,593
Merritt, you don't know what
that's gonna do. (CRACK)

634
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:33,617
(GROANS)

635
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:35,119
(SIGHS)

636
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:38,582
You're right.

637
00:37:40,158 --> 00:37:41,158
What...

638
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:44,695
(POUNDING)

639
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:52,604
Funny thing about doing the
same thing over and over again,

640
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:55,504
you learn how to do it better.

641
00:37:56,875 --> 00:37:59,106
I suppose that's the true
purpose of a library now?

642
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,404
Ah.

643
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,274
Your treasured tomes.

644
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:04,905
Each one a life.

645
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:06,878
A destiny.

646
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:10,455
I'm most curious about who
my next few wives will be.

647
00:38:10,522 --> 00:38:13,356
You never know, Alice.

648
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,955
Let's go find our
books, shall we?

649
00:38:25,637 --> 00:38:27,833
Something to add,
Madam Librarian? Yes.

650
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,934
If you really want
to know your future,

651
00:38:30,608 --> 00:38:33,134
you'd better be
able to speed read.

652
00:38:35,346 --> 00:38:36,609
No!

653
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:39,212
No! No!

654
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:41,618
No! No! No!

655
00:39:03,575 --> 00:39:04,804
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

656
00:39:05,877 --> 00:39:06,877
Enter.

657
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:25,830
I was just checking to
make sure you were all right.

658
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:28,428
Thank you for your concern.

659
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:31,030
I'm fine.

660
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:33,864
Just a bit tired.

661
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:35,005
Hmm.

662
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:36,402
I can imagine. (GROANING)

663
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:40,143
Hmm.

664
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,702
You were incredible out there.

665
00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:43,673
Maybe once.

666
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,445
Now it's, um...

667
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:49,148
What's the military term?

668
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:51,284
Holding action.

669
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:54,550
Nothing but holding actions.

670
00:39:56,427 --> 00:40:00,057
I saw that not all the
Centurions returned.

671
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:09,234
Good night, Seb.

672
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:18,744
What exactly are
we looking for, sir?

673
00:40:20,218 --> 00:40:21,914
Not what. Who.

674
00:40:22,654 --> 00:40:24,646
Well, both.

675
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:48,578
(CLATTERING)

676
00:40:53,751 --> 00:40:54,751
(MEN GRUNT)

677
00:41:00,825 --> 00:41:01,825
Grab it. Grab it.

678
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:15,298
You two know each other?

679
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:17,431
No.

680
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:22,343
Then you won't mind taking
charge of its imprisonment.

681
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,973
Of course not, sir.

682
00:41:39,297 --> 00:41:44,793
And all the books on
everyone are gone for good.

683
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:50,433
Maybe that means actual free will
now, and not any of that predestined shit.

684
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,806
(CLEARS THROAT)

685
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:56,880
Or lots of rewrites to do.

686
00:41:57,315 --> 00:42:00,046
Sorry, Zelda. It's a
bad day for everybody.

687
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:02,452
At least the fires
drove them out.

688
00:42:02,587 --> 00:42:05,216
We think they got about
half the collection. Mmm.

689
00:42:05,323 --> 00:42:07,690
Yep, and everything
on the Convergence.

690
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:11,389
So what do we do now? We
try and trade with the Visigoths?

691
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:13,326
What do we have that they want?

692
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:18,131
I mean, the Overlord kind
of liked me. Off the table.

693
00:42:19,604 --> 00:42:22,130
I read most of the books
on the Convergence.

694
00:42:22,607 --> 00:42:24,303
Enough to know
it can be stopped.

695
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:28,777
It's almost impossible,
but not complicated.

696
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:35,513
Zelda, please tell.

697
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:37,748
Oh. Of course.

698
