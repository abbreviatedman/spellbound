00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,743
Oh. (MERRITT GASPING)

177
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,585
I traveled us to 1998.

178
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:41,091
Yeah, well, I have a strong guess
which Chatwin you're related to.

180
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:44,421
KADY: The Couple?
Never heard of them.

181
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:47,763
I hadn't either until they sent
a shiitake monster after me.

182
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:49,779
I'd like to know who they are

183
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,533
before they come
looking for me again.

184
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:54,297
Well, I know a guy.

185
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,442
He owes me, like,
three favors, so, let's see.

186
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,070
(SIGHS) Thanks, Kady.
(SENT TONE CHIMES)

187
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:03,273
Now you owe me
three favors. Hmm.

189
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:07,853

You are never
gonna believe where.

193
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,521
The hell happened here?

194
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,197
ZELDA: We've been redecorating.

195
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,963
Alice and Kady, I'm so
very glad you've come.

196
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,732
KADY: Zelda? What
are you doing here?

197
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,535
Rebuilding. Come
to see George, yes?

198
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,806
Didn't know you knew him.

199
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,367
Hmm. He's right over there.

200
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,369
(INDISTINCT CHATTER) Oh.

201
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,880
Hey.

202
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:38,816
How did all this happen? Are those
Hedges working with Librarians?

203
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:41,317
Honestly? It was you.

204
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:43,357
After you helped me
burn all those books,

205
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:46,449
I realized the Library needed
to be rebuilt from the ground up.

206
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,104
ALICE: How did you
convince them to help you?

207
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:50,893
I'd been helping Kady and
Harriet remove Reed's Marks.

208
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,296
A sort of penance,
if we're being honest.

209
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,858
But suddenly I found myself
surrounded by grateful Magicians

210
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,699
just looking for
something to do.

211
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:58,771
(CRACKLING)

212
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:00,196
What was that?

213
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:04,069
Our new recruits are enthusiastic,
but their education is spotty.

214
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:06,737
This branch is kept functioning
by very specific spells.

215
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,906
But proper casting,
especially here,

216
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:12,349
in the Circumstances of the
Neitherlands, sometimes eludes them.

217
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:15,680
Alice? This is George.

218
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,952
So, you're the one
the Couple's after?

219
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:19,358
Do you know them?

220
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:21,622
No. But I know a guy who might.

221
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,094
I need a day to track him down.

222
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:28,062
Thanks, George.
Two favors to go.

223
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,729
As long as you're waiting, perhaps
you could help us with a problem?

224
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36,504
I've pulled some volumes from
the Poison Room. Highly dangerous.

225
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,371
You're some of the few I
trust to look through them.

226
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,874
And what are you looking for?

227
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:43,444
A way to fix magic.

228
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:48,417
Unless you have something
more important to do?

229
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:55,956
Thank God I got
past the Centurion.

230
00:09:56,062 --> 00:10:00,056
How the hell is the Dark King still
alive? We cut down his tree. Stabbed him.

231
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:01,465
This doesn't seem possible.

232
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:04,248
El said he's a healer. Maybe he
cast something with his last breath.

233
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:06,933
I don't know. But our
friends are back there.

234
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:13,277
I can see Josh hiding out, so he's
safe for now. But Julia and Eliot?

235
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,375

back here before us?

236
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,550

00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:33,332
Okay.

Uh, Margo, what are you doing?

240
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,395
Life lesson, Fen.
There's always a point

241
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,099
where you can decide,
"That's not my problem."

249
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,217
Wait. I think he's trying
to tell us something.

250
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,295
Exactly. About Fillory?

251
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:03,887

there's an insect called
the Tongue Twister

258
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:27,552
that supposedly crawls into your
skull and confuses your words.

259
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:28,917
Is that like a stroke?

Wait, no. God damn it.

264
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:40,666
What happened?

265
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,532
Josh put my eye in his
pocket, so I can't see shit.

266
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:49,465
If he's got something to say about
the Dark King, we need to know it.

267
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:52,373
How? If he's got Tongue
Twisters in his brain hole?

268

butter in my turkey sandwich.

I thought wonky casting
was an Earth-specific problem.

I think this issue's more basic.

At least Zelda can reassign
Hedges that cast for shit.

Fire the moon, I mean.

would end in fiery apocalypse.

Yes.

520
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:16,246
Look. (SCOFFS)

521
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,253
PENNY: "September, 1998."

522
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:20,657
I was holding it when
we traveled to 1998.

523
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:23,456
And then, I was
holding the compass

524
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:26,158
that was made today
when we landed here today.

525
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:27,699
Oh.

526
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:29,260
They're totems.

527
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:33,936
Remedial Traveler students
sometimes have trouble

528
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:35,440
picturing their destination,

529
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:38,602
so holding an object from
that place can sometimes help.

530
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:42,475
Okay, so that, but
time instead of space?

531
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:44,513
So I guess in
order to get home...

532
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:45,982
We need something from our time.

533
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,711
"From our time." I
was gonna say it.

534
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:56,427
Hey, you know this language?

535
00:24:58,497 --> 00:24:59,497
Um...

536
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:03,331
The front half looks
like Old Church Slavonic.

537
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:04,813
The back half, I
don't recognize it.

538
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,669
No, no, no. The
Slavonic part I could read.

539
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:10,267
It's something about a seed
that could grow into anything.

540
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,904
What if it could
grow into a moon?

541
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:23,154
I don't believe it.

542
00:25:23,222 --> 00:25:24,222
What?

543
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:31,863
That this book is missing a page.
Something called the World Seed.

544
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,008
How do you know what it's about

545
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,193
if the page is missing?

546
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:39,596
Because it's what the Couple's
after. The page. And I have it.

547
00:25:40,406 --> 00:25:41,406
What?

548
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:44,477
Meanwhile, we're trying
to solve a different problem.

549
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,567
But then... (SIGHS)

550
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:48,203
But there's this book that
happens to be the same book

551
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:50,077
that the World Seed
page came from?

552
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:52,408
Coincidence,
synchronicity, or...

553
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:54,686
I always assume trap.

554
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:57,013
How much do you
trust the Hedges?

555
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:59,149
About as much as
you trust the Library.

556
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:00,324
Hmm.

557
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,591
There's no way this isn't a con.

558
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:07,366
We're looking for an answer
that requires unusual power.

559
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,432
Something unusually powerful.

560
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:11,970
Logically, it's gonna be rare,

561
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,596
lot of people wanting it. Right?

562
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:17,403
So, not weird, right?

563
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:19,803
Just saying.

564
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:23,405
True. I mean, it can't
be this easy. Can it?

565
00:26:24,183 --> 00:26:26,618
Maybe everything's been
really hard for a long time,

566
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:28,914
and we caught a single
fucking break for once.

567
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:31,055

568
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:36,184
Oh, hey, a Smoothie
Castle card from 2009.

569
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:40,559
So we don't have
anything from 2020?

570
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:43,727
Great, so we're just stuck in
this backwards-ass place here.

571
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:45,736
Did you do this?

572
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,438
Do what?

573
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:50,134
Brakebills has
given me the icy mitt.

574
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:51,800
I've been streeted.

575
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:53,904
Oh, my God. Expelled.

576
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:56,241
Someone ratted
me out to the faculty.

577
00:26:56,315 --> 00:26:57,315
Well, it wasn't us.

578
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,578
Someone must've
overheard our conversation.

579
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:04,651
Well, eavesdropping on a private
moment? Who would do that?

580
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:09,922
You. Constantly. Which is
why you're getting expelled.

581
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:14,795
Did you give her permission
to use irony in this way?

00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:19,003
Good riddance
to the both of you.

584
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,097
This is bad.

585
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:24,633
He was supposed to
stay, get caught projecting,

586
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:26,735
and then be trapped when
someone hides his body.

587
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:30,213
Okay, so then expulsion
actually saves him

588
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:33,285
from being trapped in
astral purgatory for a century,

589
00:27:33,352 --> 00:27:37,050
and saves generations of
Brakebills women from being spied on.

590
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:38,156
You don't get it.

591
00:27:38,457 --> 00:27:40,756
If Hyman doesn't get trapped,
he can't help future me.

592
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:43,793
And future me can't
save magic, and we lose it.

593
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:45,823
Forever.

594
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,963
We need to fix this.

595
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:54,230
(SCOFFS) But how? By
trapping him ourselves?

00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:55,907

chance to finally go to Europe.

I hear Weimar Berlin's got
some swell erotic attractions.

I came to Brakebills
to learn, you know,

606
00:28:28,574 --> 00:28:31,066
and the lesson of my
expulsion is clear as a creek.

Maybe, and I know this is crazy,

608

but maybe it is wrong to
spy on people in the shower.

Look, being a Traveler
can feel like a burden, yes.

But not being a Traveler?

spot and Hyman finds it.

693
00:32:38,757 --> 00:32:41,454
That only he could
vanquish them.

694
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,988
So I was curious.
Who was this Magician?

695
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:47,292
What was his story?

696
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:49,061
So I sought him out.

697
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:53,071
And I was shocked to
discover that I knew him.

698
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:54,271
(GASPS)

699
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:57,303
You are good at telling stories.

700
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:58,501
Thank you.

701
00:32:58,777 --> 00:33:04,808
Now, in order to talk about who he
is, and where he actually came from,

702
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:06,818
we need to look further back.

703
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:10,014
To a time before Martin
Chatwin became The Beast.

704
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:11,714
Mmm. Shh. Really?

705
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:15,354
PLOVER: <i>Long before he
discovered the Wellspring,</i>

706
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,692
<i>Martin had another
plan to make sure</i>

707
00:33:18,797 --> 00:33:21,357
<i>that he never got
sent back to Earth.</i>

708
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:24,868
<i>A conduit spell to
tie himself to Fillory.</i>

709
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,871
Once we begin, we will
only have a few moments.

710
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:33,570
Seb, we should talk about this.

711
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,442
Look, we know what
you're trying to do.

712
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:36,846
I strongly doubt that.

713
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:40,919
We know it. The Dark King used it.
Except we chopped down his tree.

714
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,648
But there's an essential fact

715
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:46,715
that perhaps you don't
know about the trees of Fillory.

716
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:50,819
You see, there are many,
but in truth, only one.

717
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:52,859
What kind of bullshit is that?

718
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:55,992
Yeah. I mean, I'm Fillorian
and I have never heard that.

719
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:59,469
You see, the roots of the
trees of Fillory intertwine,

720
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:00,870
such that they become one,

721
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:03,465
not just with each
other, but with the land.

722
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:06,569
And anyone tied
to that can't be killed

723
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:10,615
by just chopping down a single
tree or, pfft, even an entire forest.

724
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,513
They can only be stopped

725
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:14,849
by destroying all of Fillory.

726
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:18,421
Wait. So you're saying Martin
tried, but screwed up or whatever?

727
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:19,616
He was thwarted,

728
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:23,354
by someone heroic who
knew what he could become.

729
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:25,897
Martin's own brother, Rupert.

730
00:34:26,965 --> 00:34:29,696
Rupert Sebastian Chatwin.

731
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:34,399
Oh, my gods, what a twist.
You're such a natural at this.

732
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:38,500
PLOVER: <i>He realized that the only
way to stop his brother was sacrifice.</i>

733
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:41,945
<i>So he tied himself to the
conduit before his brother could.</i>

734
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:46,947
<i>When Martin discovered what
had happened, oh, he was furious.</i>

735
00:34:47,052 --> 00:34:49,283
<i>He couldn't kill
his own brother.</i>

736
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:52,619
<i>But he could curse
him with eternal sleep.</i>

737
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:54,818
<i>The people of Fillory
thought he was dead.</i>

738

(GROWLING)

739
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:03,695
What's happening to him?

740
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:04,895
Exactly what's meant to.

741
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:08,100
What happened?

742
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,571
You happened.

743
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:13,569
You brought surges of magic,

744
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:17,741
so huge you woke Rupert
up. And he brought the Takers.

745
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:19,717
And then when he
held them at bay,

746
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:23,186
the Fillorians, in gratitude,
made him High King.

747
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:27,851
But why did he do all that?

748
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:31,452
Yeah. If he was so good,
why did he become so evil?

749
00:35:31,563 --> 00:35:34,192
Because while he slumbered,

750
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:37,758
he lost the one
thing he cared about.

751
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:39,600
<i>The man he loved.</i>

752
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:47,477

much I missed you?

763

764
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:19,774
Lance, I've... I've been trying.

765
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,040
(SIGHS) You left me.

766
00:36:22,147 --> 00:36:24,241
No. You abandoned me.

767
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:26,341
No, I needed to stop my brother.

768
00:36:26,451 --> 00:36:29,148
And now I'm dead,
and you can never die.

769
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:34,653
It's cold here. I'm so alone.

770
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:38,664
Oh, I've almost given
up so many times.

pass through it.

will be able to soon.

(GRUNTS)

867
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:45,031
Fillory can never be free so
long as the Dark King reigns.

868
00:41:45,737 --> 00:41:48,206
One thing I'm confused about.

869
00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:50,002
Where do you
fit into all of this?

870
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:55,374
Well, Rupert recognized me.
Oh, he's always disliked me.

871
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,450
He's the one who cursed
me with the Tongue Twisters.

872
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:02,381
Well, I shall find no happiness
in Fillory so long as he's around.

873
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:06,385
So after you leave here,
what? Just gonna hit the streets?

874
00:42:06,491 --> 00:42:10,553
Oh, hardly. I shall write.

875
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:13,197
The things I have seen.

876
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:16,191
The stories I can tell.

877
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:18,529
His stories are very good.

878
00:42:18,603 --> 00:42:20,504
Just not exactly
kid-appropriate. (BUZZING)

879
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:22,301
(PLOVER GASPING)

880
00:42:23,074 --> 00:42:24,167
Oh. Oh.

881
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:28,873
Vexing. Oh, flattery flophouse.

882
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:34,178
Did you really have to do that?
He seemed like such a nice...

883
00:42:34,252 --> 00:42:36,244
Pedophile? He's
grooming you, Fen,

884
00:42:36,354 --> 00:42:37,754
because you act like you're 12.

885
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:39,414
Oh, gods.

886
00:42:39,524 --> 00:42:42,221
Remember, make sure to
lock on the right vibration.

887
00:42:42,627 --> 00:42:43,627
(EXHALES)

888
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:48,698
Can you feel it?

889
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:49,766
Mmm.

890
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:51,368
It feels like home.

891
00:42:51,436 --> 00:42:52,436
(CHUCKLES)

892
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:56,166
Here we go.

893
00:42:56,808 --> 00:42:57,808
(BOTH GASP)

894
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:02,246
Hi. (CHUCKLING)

895
00:43:03,214 --> 00:43:04,214
(LAUGHS) I think...

896
00:43:04,282 --> 00:43:05,875
I think... I think we did it.

897
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:06,974
Oh. (CHUCKLES)

898
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:08,519
Shall I let go of your hand?

899
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:14,052
This... Did you...

900
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:17,660
No. Not on purpose.

901
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:20,459
I'm not sure how I
even did this at all.

902
00:43:20,832 --> 00:43:22,130
Oh, why do I feel like I've...

903
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:25,169
Been here before?
Because this is it.

904
00:43:26,304 --> 00:43:28,603
This is where the
signal brought us.

905
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:32,074
Okay, okay. I'll
just travel us out.

906
00:43:32,143 --> 00:43:33,143
Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

907
00:43:33,244 --> 00:43:34,542
(BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY)

908
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:38,912
Plum? It's not working.

909
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:41,447
We can't leave.

910
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,453
(GASPS)
