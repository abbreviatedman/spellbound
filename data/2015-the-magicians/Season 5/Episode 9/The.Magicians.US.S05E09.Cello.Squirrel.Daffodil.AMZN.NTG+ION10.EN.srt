1
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,799
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,964
Christopher Plover.

3
00:00:08,965 --> 00:00:10,340
The children's book author?

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,620
You're familiar with my work.

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,220
I've read Martin Chatwin's book.

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,939
Oh, you're the pervert who
turned him into The Beast.

7
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:18,920
The age suspension spells Martin used,

8
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,689
they must still be keeping me alive.

9
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,800
I don't know what this signal is,

10
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,233
but I know why it's targeting me,

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,316
- and I'm gonna figure out...
- Whoa, whoa, hang on!

12
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:28,109
Merritt, you don't know
what that's gonna do.

13
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,030
You're right.

14
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:33,319
Ever since I found this page,
I knew it was important.

15
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,400
- It's an instruction manual.
- For what?

16
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,529
The World Seed.

17
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:37,909
It can grow into almost anything,

18
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:39,520
even an entire world.

19
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,430
The Couple has been looking for
the World Seed page a long time,

20
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,909
and they are not good people.

21
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,860
And they know I have what they want.

22
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,530
Pregnant.

23
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,620
Shit.

24
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,078
Really appreciate it
if we could keep this

25
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,450
- between you and I.
- Of course.

26
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,130
Let's go find our books, shall we?

27
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,340
You better be able to speed-read.

28
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,420
No!

29
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,618
Okay, so what if we locate the tree

30
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,250
from Seb's tattoo and chop it down?

31
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,519
Would that sever this conduit?

32
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,540
In theory, yes,

33
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:10,220
he would be mortal and 100% stabbable.

34
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,830
Jesus, cock and balls,
what's keeping Julia and El?

35
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,598
We just murdered the
goddamn king back there.

36
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,038
- They should act like it.
- Ooh, sorry.

37
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,500
Probably just Julia's toe worms.

38
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,870
Hey, we should stop so she can catch up.

39
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,930
You've got toe worms,

40
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,390
and you're moving at a normal speed.

41
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,010
Oh, I'm just used to...

42
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,670
Hey, what happened to your eye?

43
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,510
I lent it to Josh.

44
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,930
What happened to his eye?

45
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,540
Nothing! He's an idiot.

46
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,198
He went back to warn
Tick and Rafe to get out

47
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,170
- before things go shit-shaped.
- Okay.

48
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,680
Wait, and so why did you...

49
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:50,260
I'm worried, so I'm keeping
an eye on him, okay?

50
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,410
- Christ.
- Oh, it's a pun. I get it,

51
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,590
'cause you gave him your eye.

52
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,780
Shut the fuck up, Fen!

53
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,810
Okay.

54
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,499
Julia, you have to hurry. Are you okay?

55
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,530
Yeah, I'm just a little out of shape.

56
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,540
Okay, don't mean to push,
but since we don't know

57
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,430
how the Centurions will
react to Seb's body,

58
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,770
and you were intimately
involved in making him dead,

59
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,459
we should probably move more quickly.

60
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,089
Uh... Eliot.

61
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,950
I wouldn't if I were you.

62
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,139
Seb.

63
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,640
Surprised?

64
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,140
Take them.

65

66
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:50,040
Shit.

67
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,299
Sorry about that, Quentin.

68
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,510
_

69
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,839
Lame-ass Welters nerd.

70
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,790
Merritt?

71
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,390
What... what happened?

72
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,420
You tell me.

73
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:10,440
You said you were a Chatwin,
you ripped off your patch,

74
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,979
and then you disappeared.

75
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:15,890
Where's Julia and... and Lipson and...

76
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,940
You've been gone three weeks.

77
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:20,990
Wha...

78
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,110
It was just a room.

79
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,449
No windows, no doors,

80
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,329
no one else there.

81
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,209
That's all I remember.

82
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,329
You remember more than I did
when the signal grabbed me.

83
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:36,299
But I was there seconds,
at least I thought.

84
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,510
Who knows how this shit works?

85
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,550
- It's a weird one.
- What do your rocks say?

86
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,480
That young Merritt isn't
under any memory curses,

87
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,550
so far as I can see.

88
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,010
My name is actually Plum, remember?

89
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,269
I just have to own it.

90
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:55,230
Leave the ranks of Chatwins
who go by middle names

91
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,979
or nicknames or, you know,
super-villain monikers.

92
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,569
Hi, Plum fucking Chatwin, cursed freak.

93
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:05,239
Well, on the plus,
you don't have a brain injury,

94
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,500
you aren't psychotic,

95
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,670
and except for the disorientation

96
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,579
and a little bit of combination skin,

97
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,910
you're perfectly healthy.

98
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:16,150
Whoa, whoa, so... what?

99
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,039
You're done?

100
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,350
Well, first I'm gonna
grab a bottle of tequila

101
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,599
so that I can really enjoy

102
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,550
my post-coma limited work hours,

103
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,860
but, uh, after that, yeah, I'm done.

104
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,990
Look, this weird room,

105
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,470
that's more than we've had to go on.

106
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,900
It's also nothing to go on at all.

107
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,140
The way traveling works,

108
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,480
you imagine a place,

109
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,609
see it in your mind's eye,

110
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:47,340
and then just go. What?

111
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,710
You do know this is the most
you've actually taught

112
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,619
about traveling since you took up here.

113
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,360
Look, my point is,

114
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,289
you don't have to point on a map.

115
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,570
Just picture it.

116
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,010
You want me to go back?

117
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,549
Not really, because it's dangerous,
but just pointing out...

118
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,230
That it's the only thing we have,

119
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,760
is what you're pointing out.

120
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:06,950
When I was a first year,
I had this stupid idea

121
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,340
that teachers knew a ton more than me.

122
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,770
Gonna blow it for you.

123
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,990
Pretty much no one knows
dick about anything,

124
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,979
especially traveler shit.

125
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,800
What the signal is, why,

126
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,229
no one's waiting around to solve it.

127
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,410
But I've never traveled by myself,

128
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,590
and I don't know how,

129
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,609
and even assuming you're not
completely a shit teacher,

130
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,620
I can't go back there, not alone.

131
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,990
You won't be.

132
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:34,720
Oh, you stupid twat.

133
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,410
That hurts.

134
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,810
Kind of late to ask for
the anesthesia spell.

135
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,749
Done.

136
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,530
Now you can take people
with you when you travel,

137
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,589
which is why it is important that you...

138
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,610
Yes, I read the chapters you gave me.

139
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,970
I get the principles.

140
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,810
We start with baby steps.

141
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,780
All you gotta do is travel
us both across the lab.

142
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,729
Now, I'm gonna draw a circle.

143
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,430
Just aim for it.

144
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,690
And don't worry.

145
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,189
If you get lost, I'll be right there.

146
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,720
- Professor Adiyodi...
- It's Penny.

147
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,749
Bringing you my troubles

148
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,360
has cocked things up enough already.

149
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,409
- I don't wanna make things worse.
- Yeah, well,

150
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,459
messing up my life kind
of runs in your family.

151
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,700
I'm used to it.

152
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,330
You're not convincing me.

153
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,290
Which Chatwin are you related to?

154
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,680
Honestly, I don't know.

155
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:26,730
My parents are British.

156
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,748
They have the proper sense

157
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,759
not to speak of the family curse.

158
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,720
Well, you are the third
Chatwin I've met.

159
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,099
First one was The Beast,
who basically tortured me

160
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,190
when I was a kid, but his sister Jane,

161
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,410
she did everything
she could to stop him.

162
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,800
She changed time.

163
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,790
She was incredible.

164
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,030
So family curse?

165
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,270
Far as I'm concerned,
the scales are even.

166
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,700
You could tip it either way.

167
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:58,249
Remember, aim for the circle.

168
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,280
Here goes nothing.

169
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,950
I did it. I actually did it.

170
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,290
I honestly thought I was just
gonna, like, kill us both.

171
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,049
Like, straight up 50/50 chance...

172
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,340
Plum.

173
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,000
Yeah.

174
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,139
Where's the chalk circle?

175
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:20,140
It... it's... huh?

176
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,229
Hey, where's everybody going?

177
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,910
Dean Shiring got dial-up
in the computer closet.

178
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,910
We're gonna use it to
read the Starr Report,

179
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,940
or at least the blow job parts.

180
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,360
- Dial-up?
- Starr Report? Thank you...

181
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,790
- That came out...
- Oh.

182
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,619
I traveled us to 1998.

183
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,650
Yeah, well, I have a strong guess

184
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,200
which Chatwin you're related to.

185
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,459
"The Couple"? Never heard of 'em.

186
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,860
I hadn't either until they sent

187
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,639
a shiitake monster after me.

188
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,758
I'd like to know who they are

189
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:56,410
before they come looking for me again.

190
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,940
Well, I know a guy.

191
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,330
He owes me, like, three favors,

192
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,479
so let's see.

193
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,100
Thanks, Kady.

194
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,399
- Now you owe me three favors.
- Hmm.

195
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:12,860
He wants to meet.

196
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,909
You are never gonna believe where.

197
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,580
What the hell happened here?

198
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,230
We've been redecorating.

199
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,900
Alice and Kady, I'm so
very glad you've come.

200
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,629
- Zelda.
- What are you doing here?

201
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,130
Rebuilding.

202
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,470
Come to see George, yes?

203
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,799
Didn't know you knew him.

204
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,889
Hmm. He's right over there.

205
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:37,940
Oh.

206
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,519
Hey, how did all this happen?

207
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,979
Are those hedges working
with librarians?

208
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,350
Honestly, it was you.

209
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,570
After you helped me
burn all those books,

210
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,480
I realized the Library
needed to be rebuilt

211
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,520
from the ground up.

212
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,109
How did you convince them to help you?

213
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,820
I've been helping Kady and Harriet

214
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:55,950
remove Reed's Marks...

215
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,250
a sort of penance,
if we're being honest...

216
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,830
but suddenly I found myself surrounded

217
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,369
by grateful magicians just
looking for something to do.

218
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:05,330
What was that?

219
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,170
Our new recruits are enthusiastic,

220
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,170
but their education is spotty.

221
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,759
This branch is kept functioning
by very specific spells,

222
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,899
but proper casting, especially here

223
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,040
in the Circumstances
of the Neitherlands,

224
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,380
sometimes eludes them.

225
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,120
Alice, this is George.

226
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,320
So you're the one The Couple's after.

227
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,349
Do you know them?

228
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,680
No, but I know a guy who might.

229
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,160
I need a day to track him down.

230
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,860
Thanks, George.

231
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,140
Two favors to go.

232
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,819
As long as your waiting,

233
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,739
perhaps you could help
us with a problem?

234
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,570
I've pulled some volumes
from the Poison Room.

235
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,610
Highly dangerous.

236
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,110
You're some of the few
I trust to look through them.

237
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,919
What are you looking for?

238
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,460
A way to fix magic.

239
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,630
Unless you have something
more important to do.

240
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,500
Oh.

241
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,009
Thank God we got past the Centurions.

242
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:03,160
How the hell's the
Dark King still alive?

243
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,090
We cut down his tree, stabbed him.

244
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,429
It doesn't seem possible.

245
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:07,639
El said he's a healer.

246
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,268
Maybe he cast something
with his last breath.

247
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:12,320
I don't know, but our
friends are back there.

248
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,810
I can see Josh hiding out,
so he's safe for now,

249
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,320
but Julia and Eliot...

250
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,410
Did they get back here before us?

251
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:29,919
Hey!

252
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,850
Who the fuck are you?

253
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,390
Ah, cello.

254
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,040
Squirrel, daffodil.

255
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:39,120
- Okay.
- Uh,

256
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,250
Margo, what are you doing?

257
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,490
Life lesson, Fen.

258
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,570
There's always a point
where you can decide,

259
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,100
"That's not my problem."

260
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,050
Oh, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

261
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:50,700
We have friends to save,
a Dark King to re-kill.

262
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:53,660
Hang with Mad Libs
pedophile all you want.

263
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,510
I'm going back to
double-tap the motherfucker

264
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,819
like he's Osama and I'm SEAL Team Bitch.

265
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,819
No, no. Excelsior in springtime.

266
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,750
- Excelsior in springtime.
- Whatever you say.

267
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,950
I think he's trying to tell us something

268
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,830
about Fillory and the Dark King?

269
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,919
Charcuterie.

270
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,230
Either he had a stroke,

271
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,790
or some whimsical Fillorian
shit happened to him.

272
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,339
Yes. Secrets and blueberries.

273
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,430
Spongy walrus hat.

274
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,210
On the edge of the Burnt River,

275
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,120
there's an insect called
the Tongue Twister

276
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,620
that supposedly crawls into your skull

277
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,639
and confuses your words.

278
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,250
Is that like a stroke?

279
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,640
Fingernail clippings.

280
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,560
Hold up.

281
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,239
Somebody's near Josh.

282
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,319
Son of a shit, it's the Dark King.

283
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,530
He's coming.

284
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,739
Wait, no! God damn it!

285
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,139
- What happened?
- Josh put my eye in his pocket,

286
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,700
so I can't see shit.

287
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,140
If he's got something to
say about the Dark King,

288
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,619
we need to know it.

289
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:55,790
How?

290
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,539
If he's got Tongue Twisters
in his brain hole?

291
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,629
I know a guy.

292
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,219
He's an idiot,

293
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,420
but he might be able to help.

294
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,850
Professor Fogg?

295
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,479
Hi.

296
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,280
Ski masks.

297
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,359
Big trend in the future?

298
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,989
Trying to avoid a time paradox.

299
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:21,170
Ah, smart and stupid.

300
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,069
You don't think I'll
recognize your voices?

301
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:24,829
Kind of counted on you
being a little drunk.

302
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:26,209
Hmm.

303
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:27,669
It's the afternoon.

304
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,399
Next time, try Pinter's
facial distortion,

305
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,190
literally made for this sort of thing,

306
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,080
unless you, you know, prefer this look.

307
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,879
Yeah, look, what do you know

308
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,680
about time travelers?

309
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,009
They're a myth.

310
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,589
And yet, here we are.

311
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:48,439
Well, seems like you have
a gift, Ms. Ski Mask,

312
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,309
but poor aim.

313
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,070
Can you help?

314
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,316
Maybe.

315
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:00,610
This time bridge is set for
a fixed moment in time,

316
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:04,529
but we can remove the temporal compass

317
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:09,079
and adjust it to help you
navigate back to 2020.

318
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,130
- Can you feel the vibration?
- Yeah.

319
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,450
Good. It's pointing towards home.

320
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,619
Thanks, Professor Fogg.

321
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,399
No, gosh, thank you, thank you.

322
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,709
This might all make an
excellent dissertation.

323
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,690
Might even be worth a promotion.

324
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,010
Oh, God, no.

325
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,620
Me, Dean? No.

326
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:26,570
I'd have to pay off a lot
of colleagues' wives.

327
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,050
Good luck.

328
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,010
Did it work?

329
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,050
Are we back?

330
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,700
I don't know.

331
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,390
Excuse me.

332
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,159
Be a pal and sweep up
the men's dining room?

333
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,370
Thanks.

334
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:00,910
Nope.

335
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,410
How is Seb still alive?

336
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,799
I have no idea.

337
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,680
I mean, you saw me run him
through with a sword,

338
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,999
which is not something I expected to do

339
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,300
to anyone, kind of ever.

340
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,250
You okay?

341
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,590
Yeah, um, I just have a problem,

342
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,940
and it's getting worse.

343
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,980
How'd you get so pregnant?

344
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:34,020
The usual way, except
it's Red Monkey Month,

345
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,875
so everything grows a lot faster.

346
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,650
I guess...

347
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,220
congratulations?

348
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,790
- Ugh.
- Thanks, I think.

349
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,170
Present deal aside,

350
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,590
the whole circle of life of this,

351
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,990
it's kind of very moving.

352
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,060
In a far less dungeon-y timeline,

353
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:56,010
I'd definitely be asking you

354
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,920
to throw me a baby
shower right about now.

355
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,330
I know a spell to make sparkling cider

356
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,460
get you hammered.

357
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,110
Perfect loophole for this situation.

358
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,019
Glad to see you're
keeping your spirits up.

359
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,939
I wouldn't want it gloomy down here.

360
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,578
And now I've killed the conversation.

361
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,280
Are you going to execute us?

362
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,250
I can't.

363
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,619
I need your help.

364
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,370
Basic problem's the same.

365
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,990
We can't fix magic on Earth.

366
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,919
We did some stuff to the
moon, and she's mad,

367
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,230
- and she's...
- A monumental cunt?

368
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,420
Evidently.

369
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,920
So she's screwing up Circumstances.

370
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,830
My Akkadian's rusty, but I...

371
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:47,149
I think this says that we can
win the moon's favor if we...

372
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,779
Virgin sacrifice.

373
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:51,109
Okay, well, that's out.

374
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:54,280
Not to mention, the method
of death is pretty gross.

375
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,690
Ugh.

376
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,890
- That bad, huh?
- No, it's just the lights flickered,

377
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,540
and now there's peanut butter
in my turkey sandwich.

378
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:07,579
Thought wonky casting was
an Earth-specific problem.

379
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:10,240
I think this issue's more basic.

380
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,380
All the new people learning
Library operations,

381
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:14,679
including culinary charms.

382
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,139
At least Zelda can reassign
hedges that cast for shit.

383
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,389
The moon, however, has job security.

384
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,760
Hmm. You're fired, Moon.

385
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,230
Wait, what if we could?

386
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,696
Fire the moon, I mean.

387
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:30,670
Kind of remember hearing

388
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,270
Earth would end in fiery apocalypse.

389
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,670
No, I'm saying, what if we got rid of it

390
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,859
and made a new one?

391
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:39,409
That's batshit.

392
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,810
This book is on Earth-works magic

393
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,910
in the South Pacific.

394
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,999
You know, how to create
an island out of nothing.

395
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,960
Ye... that's not exactly the same.

396
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,520
These books are from the Poison Room,

397
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,589
not for amateurs.

398
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,919
If there's a way to make a
new moon, it'll be in here.

399
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,760
- Say, "Ah."
- Fire engine.

400
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:07,560
Well, there's your problem.
He can't talk right.

401
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:09,319
No shit, Gordy. We wanna know why.

402
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,698
Check his ears. Anything in there?

403
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,830
Hmm.

404
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,820
Just your usual ear stuff.

405
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,690
Hold up, what is that?

406
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:20,580
Give me a minute. It's deep in there.

407
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,290
And blammo.

408
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:28,780
Yep, it's a Tongue Twister.

409
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,020
How you feeling now?

410
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,290
Linoleum.

411
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,000
Shit, it wasn't the bug.

412
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,520
Huh, well, maybe not this one.

413
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,820
There's a bunch in there.

414
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,009
Hundreds.

415
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:42,730
Thousands.

416
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,360
All down his... mm...

417
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,059
spinal bones?

418
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,979
I can get 'em out if I can keep one.

419
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,149
Sure I'll regret asking. Why?

420
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:54,200
For the respect.

421
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:57,279
So I can write a... a...

422
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,449
- Paper?
- Right, one of those.

423
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:02,040
It'd be huge for me.

424
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,699
I'll never get laughed
at at VetCon again.

425
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:07,580
- How long is it gonna take?
- Don't know.

426
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:10,790
Looks like each critter has
an energy-meridian tether

427
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,720
as well as a physical one.

428
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:16,629
It's like he's possessed by a
thousand little spirits, so...

429
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,879
This is a possession problem?

430
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,799
No, it's a bug problem,

431
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,930
and those bugs are possessing him.

432
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,210
Don't worry. I deal with cats all day.

433
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,149
They are possessed like
you wouldn't believe.

434
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,620
Rhubarb.

435
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,120
That should do it.

436
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:45,260
He's bleeding out! Call a doctor!

437
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,430
Oh, yeah.

438
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:55,589
1920.

439
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:59,000
Maybe Fogg flipped a digit setting it.

440
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,548
If we can figure out what he got wrong,

441
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,170
we can fix his mistake.

442
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,410
I just wish we had some instructions.

443
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,310
Excuse me.

444
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,229
This area is for students
and faculty only.

445
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,019
- I am faculty.
- I'm a student.

446
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,109
And I am the King of Siam. Out.

447
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,520
Look, dude, I don't know wha...

448
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,680
Yeah, getting in a fight

449
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,070
is only gonna make this harder.

450
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,570
Thank you.

451
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,999
If we can't get in the Library,

452
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,199
then we are stuck here
reenacting "The Help"

453
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,900
with these casually racist white people.

454
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,260
Lilian, you're imagining things.

455
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:41,840
We don't know anyone
here who can help us.

456
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:44,480
I swear, Helen,
I could sense something...

457
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:47,980
someone... watching me in the bath,

458
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,890
like... like a pervert ghost.

459
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:55,730
Maybe we do know someone who can help.

460
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,360
"Of one not easily jealous,
but being wrought,

461
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:03,609
"perplexed in the extreme;

462
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:07,400
"of one whose hand,
like the base Indian,

463
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:10,040
threw a pearl away richer
than all his tribe... "

464
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:13,810
You're telling me this
guy whacks off to people

465
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:16,290
he watches from the Astral Plane?

466
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:20,589
- Yeah.
- "The melting mood... "

467
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:23,259
- Do we really need his help?
- "As the Arabian trees... "

468
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,590
Look, in 100 years,

469
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,049
he's gonna be a really nice guy, so...

470
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:30,309
Thank you, thank you, thank you,

471
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,360
thank you. It just, it... ah.

472
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:35,560
It won't feel like "Othello"
until I'm in blackface.

473
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:39,439
Okay, so he's got a ways to go.

474
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,770
Hyman.

475
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,279
Hey.

476
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,850
Do I know you?

477
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:48,860
Uh, yeah, I'm Pen...
brooke, and this is Prune.

478
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:53,750
Ah, and you are visiting mystics?

479
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,459
- Right, from India, and...
- And the...

480
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:59,169
- The Dark Continent.
- Okay.

481
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,849
God give me strength.

482
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:02,830
Yeah, well, listen,
we needed some help...

483
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,129
I'm sorry. I'm late to phrenology.

484
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,560
Okay, buddy.

485
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:08,509
Listen up, dude.

486
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:11,130
We know you're the pervert
ghost of Brakebills,

487
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:14,639
so either you help us,
or everybody knows.

488
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,110
I've looked through
everything Seb gave us,

489
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:24,080
and it seems like some sort
of communication spell.

490
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:26,030
It's going to take the three of us.

491
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:31,820
I have no clue what it does, though.

492
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,079
El?

493
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,619
Help here?

494
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,960
What's the point?

495
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:42,040
Once we're done, what reason
does he have to keep us alive?

496
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:45,570
I don't think he'll kill us.

497
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,090
You.

498
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:50,270
I saw the way he talked to you.

499
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,510
Nobody is that hurt if they don't care.

500
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:56,770
I attract the best guys, don't I?

501
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:00,750
You attract basically everyone,

502
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,480
and with that broad of an appeal,

503
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,620
you're bound to magnetize

504
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,440
a couple of questionable monarchs.

505
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,628
We will figure something out.

506
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,490
- I promise.
- Okay.

507
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,579
- Help.
- Okay.

508
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:21,200
This sigil, it looks sort of like

509
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:23,170
part of a messenger charm
that you would use

510
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,339
to send a letter across a lake

511
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,799
- or a river...
- Oh, shit.

512
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:31,160
Yeah, I recognize it.
Um, it was in a book

513
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:34,120
I was reading right after Q died.

514
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:37,840
- I was doing a lot of...
- Grief Googling?

515
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:40,639
He wants to do a séance.

516
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,019
But I thought those were bullshit.

517
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,689
Not always.

518
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:47,430
It's dark magic, and
it can go very wrong.

519
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,150
I never could figure it
out, but maybe he did.

520
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,540
But why cooperative?

521
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,100
Three people means a lot of power.

522
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:55,470
Well, he must be trying
to contact someone

523
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,080
who's been dead a very long time.

524
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,880
Oh, shit.

525
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,920
I think I know who.

526
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,080
Hello, Professor Frank.

527
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,740
Those two can't be in here
during regular hours.

528
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:14,849
Uh, they're with me.

529
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:18,250
I'm doing a report on
magic of the West Indies.

530
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:21,020
They are translating for me.

531
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:22,320
Huh.

532
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,360
Nothing, nothing. There is nothing here.

533
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:29,100
It is all theoretical.

534
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:31,619
There's not even an entry
for a temporal compass.

535
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,740
As far as I can tell,

536
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:34,870
time bridges haven't
even been invented yet.

537
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,879
Time bridges?

538
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,419
Like Professor Sato's work?

539
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,970
Is that...

540
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,090
- Hey.
- Yeah.

541
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:51,097
This looks exactly like the time bridge

542
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,390
that we pulled the compass out of.

543
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,010
- He's building it...
- Today.

544
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,599
That can't be a coincidence.

545
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,720
But still, it doesn't make any sense.

546
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,988
I mean, why take us here, to today?

547
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:04,140
And why 1998?

548
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,270
Wh-wh-wh-wh-wh...

549
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,530
You traveled to the
year of our Lord 1998?

550
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,080
No, no, no. Horsefeathers.

551
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:15,860
What, was the world overrun
with metal automatons

552
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:17,579
taking over all the work of men?

553
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,780
Yes.

554
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,709
- Look.
- Oh, my God.

555
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,629
September, 1998.

556
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,890
I was holding it when
we traveled to 1998,

557
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,890
and then I was holding the compass

558
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,960
that was made today when
we landed here today.

559
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,810
Oh, they're totems.

560
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:38,200
Remedial traveler students
sometimes have trouble

561
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,290
picturing their destinations,
so holding an object

562
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,979
from that place can sometimes help.

563
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:46,899
Okay, so that, but
time instead of space.

564
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,880
So I guess in order to get home...

565
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,360
We need something from our time.

566
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:53,190
"From our time," I was gonna say that.

567
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:00,750
Hey, you know this language?

568
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,459
Um...

569
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,629
the front half looks like
Old Church Slavonic.

570
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,130
The back half, I don't recognize it.

571
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,879
The Slavonic part I could read.

572
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,259
It's something about a seed
that could grow into anything.

573
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:18,170
What if it could grow into a moon?

574
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,440
- I don't believe it.
- What?

575
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,900
This book is missing a page,

576
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,909
something called the World Seed.

577
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,220
How do you know what it's about

578
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,370
if the page is missing?

579
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,500
Because it's what The Couple's after,

580
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,860
the page, and I have it.

581
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,709
What?

582
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,970
Meanwhile, we're trying to
solve a different problem,

583
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,960
but then... but there's this
book that happens to be

584
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:54,550
the same book that the
World Seed page came from?

585
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,250
Coincidence, synchronicity, or...

586
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,100
I always assume trap.

587
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:01,229
How much do you trust the hedges?

588
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:03,559
About as much as you trust the Library.

589
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,290
Hmm.

590
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,640
Then there's no way this isn't a con.

591
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:11,529
We're looking for an answer
that requires unusual power.

592
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,740
Something unusually powerful.

593
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:16,480
Logically, it's gonna be rare,

594
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:17,828
a lot of people wanting it, right?

595
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:21,810
So not weird, right?

596
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:25,110
- Just saying.
- True.

597
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,089
I mean, it can't be this easy, can it?

598
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:30,879
Maybe everything's been
really hard for a long time,

599
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,420
and we caught a single
fucking break for once.

600
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:40,516
Oh, hey, Smoothie Castle card from 2009.

601
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,937
So we don't have anything from 2020?

602
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:48,020
Great, so we're just stuck
in this backwards-ass place.

603
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:51,720
- Did you do this?
- Do what?

604
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:54,569
Brakebills has given me the icy mitt.

605
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:56,270
I've been streeted.

606
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,310
Oh, my... expelled!

607
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,578
Someone ratted me out to the faculty.

608
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,659
Well, it wasn't us.

609
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,957
Someone must have overheard
our conversation.

610
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:07,939
Wha... eavesdropping
on a private moment?

611
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,961
Who would do that?

612
00:27:08,962 --> 00:27:11,297
You, constantly,

613
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,340
which is why you're getting expelled.

614
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:20,200
Did you give her permission
to use irony in this way?

615
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:24,099
Just... good riddance
to the both of you.

616
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,340
This is bad.

617
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:29,040
He was supposed to stay,
get caught projecting,

618
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:31,069
and then be trapped when
someone hides his body.

619
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:34,450
Okay, so then expulsion
actually saves him

620
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:37,740
from being trapped in Astral
Purgatory for a century

621
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:40,490
and saves generations
of Brakebills women

622
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,690
- from being spied on.
- You don't get it.

623
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,119
If Hyman doesn't get trapped,
he can't help future me,

624
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,500
and future me can't save magic,
and we lose it forever.

625
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:54,370
We need to fix this.

626
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,780
How?

627
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:59,009
By trapping him ourselves?

628
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,300
Exactly.

629
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,180
Wait.

630
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:15,460
On the bright side, this is my
chance to finally go to Europe.

631
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:19,289
I hear Weimar Berlin's got some swell

632
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:20,870
"erotique" attractions.

633
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:23,500
I bet.

634
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,400
God, what am I doing?

635
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:32,880
I came to Brakebills to learn, you know?

636
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:35,419
And the lesson of my expulsion
is clear as a creek.

637
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:39,509
Maybe, and I know this is crazy,

638
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:44,259
but maybe it is wrong to spy
on people in the shower.

639
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,920
Well...

640
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,410
I know!

641
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,790
Then why did God give you the ability

642
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,000
to spy on people in the shower?

643
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:56,990
Look, I can't tell you how
to live your life, but...

644
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,669
Look, being a traveler can
feel like a burden, yes,

645
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:05,640
but not being a traveler,

646
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,140
not being able to use your gift,

647
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,710
it's worse.

648
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,860
Believe me.

649
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:15,210
There's no harm in looking, right?

650
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,750
You know?

651
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:22,140
- Oh.
- You're a good egg, Penbrooke.

652
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:23,190
Okay.

653
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,730
Hey, before I forget,

654
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,090
any idea how I can score some tickets

655
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,349
to the women's Welters match?

656
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,870
It's in an hour.

657
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,970
Women's Welters has a match tonight?

658
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,399
That's not on the schedule.

659
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,660
Oh, it's a surprise match, yeah.

660
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:46,910
They are probably in the
locker room right now.

661
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,400
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, I see.

662
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:54,220
I am going to need to
finish packing by myself.

663
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:57,449
- In private, okay?
- Yeah, okay. Cool.

664
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,120
Great. Uh, yeah, bye.

665
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,488
Okay, it worked. We only
have a few minutes.

666
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:09,500
Okay, um, hear me out on something.

667
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:11,660
Yes, it's bad. Magic's at stake.

668
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:12,778
Do I have to do the speech again?

669
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:15,840
I stole this from
Professor Sato's things.

670
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:18,069
Stasis charm, freezes
the wearer in time.

671
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:21,100
Plum, the body isn't
supposed to be preserved.

672
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,980
- It's supposed to die.
- Who says?

673
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,650
No one ever found his body.

674
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,659
Maybe we were the ones
who hid it in the first place.

675
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,108
That's not how time works.

676
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,369
How do you know?

677
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,790
What matters is he'd still be trapped

678
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,998
and still be on the Astral Plane.

679
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,709
Unless it's a shitty hiding
spot, and Hyman finds it.

680
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:36,920
Unless he doesn't,

681
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:39,310
and 100 years from now we can fix him.

682
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,660
What's the point of having
this stupid ability

683
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:43,469
if I can't change anything?

684
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,880
Who says there's a point?

685
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:46,179
You are born with this shit,

686
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,489
and you spend the rest of your life

687
00:30:47,490 --> 00:30:48,570
trying to survive it.

688
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,310
Okay? Let's go.

689
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:54,240
Or you have it ripped away

690
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:56,390
just when you figured out you wanted it.

691
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,220
I am sorry your shit is broken,

692
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,620
but the Penny I've heard about

693
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:03,020
wouldn't give a damn whether
it fucks the future or not.

694
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,990
He would do the right
thing for his friend.

695
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,860
I guess having your shit
break changes a person.

696
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:10,440
Okay,

697
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:13,810
so what kind of person
is new Penny gonna be?

698
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:20,879
Shit. I know how to get us back home.

699
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,680
Let's do this, and I'll explain.

700
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,210
Okay.

701
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,650
Gonna be sore when he wakes up.

702
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:32,090
If he wakes up.

703
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,310
- You ready to go?
- Yeah.

704
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,440
"Quentin Coldwater, Welters"...

705
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:43,490
how does that help?

706
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,949
I dropped it the day you reappeared.

707
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:48,460
When it broke, it...

708
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,820
Became a new thing.

709
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:53,579
Made the day we left, so shall we?

710
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,360
Yeah.

711
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,240
He's stable.

712
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,500
Thank you.

713
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:05,830
And talking words good.
My work here is done.

714
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,630
Respect, here I come.

715
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,310
- Oh!
- Shit.

716
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,550
All right, talk.

717
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,830
It's been centuries since
I've been able to speak.

718
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,729
It's so liberating.

719
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,810
You've been infected for centuries?

720
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:26,860
Yes, from the... just after
your reign ended until today.

721
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:29,600
Tell us everything that happened.

722
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:31,500
Screw that. What's up
with the Dark King?

723
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,888
Who is he, where does he come from,

724
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,520
and how do we kill him?

725
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:38,209
Well, I heard the same story you did.

726
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:40,790
The Dark King showed up

727
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,030
shortly after the arrival of The Takers,

728
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,959
that only he could vanquish them.

729
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,500
So I was curious.

730
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,339
Who was this Magician?

731
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,590
What was his story?

732
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,429
So I sought him out,

733
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:56,349
and I was shocked to discover

734
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,389
that I knew him.

735
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:01,640
Ooh, you are good at telling stories.

736
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:02,850
Thank you.

737
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:06,839
Now, in order to talk about who he is

738
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,149
and where he actually came from,

739
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,150
we need to look further back

740
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,449
to a time before Martin
Chatwin became The Beast.

741
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,100
- Really?
- Shh.

742
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:19,740
Long before he discovered
the Wellspring,

743
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:22,289
Martin had another plan

744
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:25,700
to make sure that he never
got sent back to Earth.

745
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:29,039
A conduit spell to
tie himself to Fillory.

746
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,260
Once we begin, we will
only have a few moments.

747
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,880
Seb, we should talk about this.

748
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,599
Look, we know what you're trying to do.

749
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,180
I strongly doubt that.

750
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:43,520
We know it. The Dark King used it,

751
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:45,229
except we chopped down his tree.

752
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:48,400
But there's an essential fact

753
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:50,999
that perhaps you don't know
about the trees of Fillory.

754
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,158
You see, there are many,
but in truth, only one.

755
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,300
What kind of bullshit is that?

756
00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:00,329
Yeah, I mean, I'm Fillorian,
and I've never heard that.

757
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:03,840
You see, the roots of the
trees of Fillory intertwine

758
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:05,209
such that they become one,

759
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,840
not just with each other,

760
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:10,130
but with the land,
and anyone tied to that

761
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,740
can't be killed by just
chopping down a single tree

762
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,960
or even an entire forest.

763
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:19,219
They can only be stopped
by destroying all of Fillory.

764
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:21,579
Wait, so you're saying Martin tried,

765
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,729
but screwed up or whatever?

766
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:26,010
He was thwarted by someone heroic

767
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,649
who knew what he could become,

768
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:31,150
Martin's own brother Rupert,

769
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,400
Rupert Sebastian Chatwin.

770
00:34:34,410 --> 00:34:37,060
Oh, my Gods, what a twist.

771
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,739
You're such a natural at this.

772
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,800
He realized that the only way

773
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:42,730
to stop his brother was sacrifice,

774
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:45,160
so he tied himself to the conduit

775
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,329
before his brother could.

776
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:49,199
When Martin discovered
what had happened,

777
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,340
oh, he was furious.

778
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:53,710
He couldn't kill his own brother,

779
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,009
but he could curse him
with eternal sleep.

780
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:59,139
The people of Fillory
thought he was dead.

781
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,980
- What's happening to him?
- Exactly what's meant to.

782
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,480
What happened?

783
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:13,990
You happened.

784
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,230
You brought surges of magic
so huge you woke Rupert up,

785
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,050
and he brought The Takers,

786
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:24,039
and then when he held them at bay,

787
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,490
the Fillorians, in gratitude,
made him High King.

788
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:32,230
But why did he do all that?

789
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,779
Yeah, if he was so good,
why did he become so evil?

790
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,680
Because while he slumbered,

791
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:42,050
he lost the one thing he cared about,

792
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:43,980
the man he loved.

793
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:51,729
Rupert, is that really you?

794
00:35:51,730 --> 00:35:52,901
Lance!

795
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,350
Lance?

796
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,445
Lance Morrison?

797
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:56,860
Rupert.

798
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:03,110
Yes, yes, it's me.

799
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,996
Finally, you're here.

800
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,650
My love, my stars, my heart.

801
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:10,540
I sound like a fool.

802
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,370
You cannot know...

803
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:15,190
Do you know how much I've missed you?

804
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,178
What took you so long?

805
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,930
Lance, I've been trying.

806
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:27,470
- You left me.
- No.

807
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,680
You abandoned me.

808
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:30,559
No, I needed to stop my brother.

809
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,450
And now I'm dead, and you can never die.

810
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:39,210
It's cold here. I'm so alone.

811
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,980
I've almost given up so many times.

812
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:45,350
No, no, just... don't.

813
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,460
I will not break my
promise to you, okay?

814
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:50,190
I finally know what to do.

815
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,330
We'll be together soon, so soon.

816
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,209
- How?
- Just wait by the door.

817
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:57,169
I've tried. I can't pass through it.

818
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:59,400
No, I know, but you
will be able to soon.

819
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:00,688
That's why I reached out to you,

820
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:02,170
to tell you to wait by the door.

821
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,720
Okay, okay.

822
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,130
Rupert...

823
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:12,230
Listen to me. Wait by the door.

824
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:14,320
Eliot.

825
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,277
What the fuck did you do?

826
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:21,950
And you actually think this
page might contain the answer?

827
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,500
Tell us what you need.

828
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,230
Our resources are at your disposal.

829
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,779
I just need to go and get it.

830
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,789
We'll send someone.

831
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,079
I'd rather get it myself.

832
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,030
A few librarians, security...

833
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,750
seems prudent to send one person.

834
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:37,940
You almost had me.

835
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:41,509
Just peanut butter and
turkey sandwiches.

836
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,210
I'm afraid I'm not following.

837
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,910
We're in the Library,
where there's glitches

838
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,889
'cause of hedges, right?

839
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,549
So why do these glitches keep happening

840
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:50,840
during lunar intervals?

841
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:52,979
Why are the Neitherlands
affected by the Earth's moon?

842
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,270
Makes no sense. Where am I really?

843
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:00,580
Earth, which you manage to figure out

844
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,310
every motherfucking time.

845
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:08,469
What is this? Some sort of illusion?

846
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,779
Psychic spell.

847
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,560
Basically you're in the Matrix,

848
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:14,959
which means we're still
on Earth, hence glitches.

849
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,080
How many times have I done this?

850
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:18,209
18.

851
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,688
Been sending you back to the beginning.

852
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,000
It's getting tiresome.

853
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,540
Wait, the... the books,

854
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,668
fixing the moon, it was all just...

855
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:26,920
Bullshit.

856
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:29,599
Starting with you getting
Kady to text me.

857
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,090
- Who are you?
- Come on.

858
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,490
I'm insulted.

859
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,720
You've been asking about me.

860
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:36,600
The Couple.

861
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:40,070
Less impressive the 18th
time you figure it out.

862
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,469
Look, you're sick of this.

863
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:42,699
I'm really sick of this.

864
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:45,700
Why don't we have this convo
in the real world, huh?

865
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:52,610
Not doing this 19 times.

866
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:55,669
Give me the page, or I kill Kady.

867
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,630
How do I know that's really Kady?

868
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,220
How do I know this is even real?

869
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:10,599
Only one way to know,

870
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,000
and that's to feel it.

871
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,970
What are you doing?

872
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:20,630
Phosphoromancer, right?

873
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,899
Please don't do this.

874
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,770
- I know you use this finger a lot.
- Please, please. No!

875
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,140
Promise... give me the page.

876
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:35,540
If the finger's still
viable, I reattach.

877
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:46,630
Middle finger, also very important.

878
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,090
Love spells need a ring finger.

879
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,920
Oh...

880
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:55,460
Pinkies are crucial.

881
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:06,820
Well? Alice?

882
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:09,199
Okay.

883
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,180
Okay.

884
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,869
You want my thumb too?

885
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:19,220
Disappointed that this isn't working,

886
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:21,840
because the next cut isn't your thumb.

887
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,500
It's Kady.

888
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:28,040
The page, or kill Kady.

889
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,900
What's it gonna be?

890
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:34,770
Okay, okay, you win. It's yours. It's...

891
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,269
it's fucking yours.

892
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:38,210
Oh, good.

893
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:41,699
Relieved.

894
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,880
Now, where do I go?

895
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:45,599
Oh, hold that thought.

896
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,819
I forgot my pen.

897
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,119
Okay.

898
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,740
Is he all right?

899
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,290
What do you care?

900
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,709
It was never my intention to hurt him.

901
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:09,217
You think that matters?

902
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,930
I lost someone too.

903
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:18,220
And I loved him so much.

904
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:20,590
I know the pain.

905
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:23,890
It's not an excuse to hurt people

906
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,649
just because you want him back.

907
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:31,529
Maybe you didn't love him
as much as you think,

908
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:34,370
because you don't understand.

909
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:37,190
I have work to do.

910
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:44,060
You see what you're up against.

911
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:46,079
Fillory can never be free

912
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:48,870
so long as the Dark King reigns.

913
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,010
One thing I'm confused about.

914
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,889
Where do you fit in to all of this?

915
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:57,260
Well, Rupert recognized me.

916
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:59,220
Oh, he's always disliked me.

917
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:02,620
He's the one who cursed me
with the Tongue Twisters.

918
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:04,990
No, I shall find no happiness in Fillory

919
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,229
so long as he's around.

920
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:08,660
So after you leave here, what?

921
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:10,200
Just gonna hit the streets?

922
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:12,069
Oh, hardly.

923
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:14,489
I shall write.

924
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:20,070
The things I have seen,
the stories I can tell.

925
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,540
His stories are very good.

926
00:42:22,550 --> 00:42:24,280
Just not exactly kid-appropriate.

927
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:29,410
Oh, oh, oh, vexing.

928
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:32,700
Oh, flattery flophouse.

929
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:36,240
Did you really have to do that?

930
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:37,959
He seemed like such a nice...

931
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,970
Pedophile?

932
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,079
He's grooming you, Fen,

933
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,540
because you act like you're 12.

934
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:43,300
Oh, Gods.

935
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:46,230
Remember, make sure to lock
on the right vibration.

936
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,529
Can you feel it?

937
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:55,156
Mm, it feels like home.

938
00:42:58,750 --> 00:42:59,770
Here we go.

939
00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:06,279
Hi.

940
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:09,960
I think... I think... I think we did it.

941
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:11,900
Should I let go of your ha...

942
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:18,170
This... did you...

943
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:21,670
No, not on purpose.

944
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,710
I do... I'm not sure
I even did this at all.

945
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,937
Whoa, why do I feel like I've...

946
00:43:25,938 --> 00:43:27,720
Been here before.

947
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,020
Because this is it.

948
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:32,810
This is where the signal brought us.

949
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:35,849
Okay, okay, I'll just travel us out.

950
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:37,320
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

951
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:42,260
- Plum.
- It's not working.

952
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:45,550
We can't leave.
