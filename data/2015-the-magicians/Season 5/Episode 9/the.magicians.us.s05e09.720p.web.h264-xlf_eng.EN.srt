1
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:08,141
‐ Previously
on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:10,077
‐ Christopher Plover.

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:10,944
‐ The children's book author?

4
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:11,945
‐ You're familiar with my work.

5
00:00:11,979 --> 00:00:14,081
‐ I've read
Martin Chatwin's book.

6
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:16,617
‐ Oh, you're the pervert
who turned him into The Beast.

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,620
‐ The age suspension spells
Martin used,

8
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:21,021
they must still
be keeping me alive.

9
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:23,423
‐ I don't know
what this signal is,

10
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:25,092
but I know why
it's targeting me,

11
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,127
and I'm gonna figure out‐‐
‐ Whoa, whoa, hang on!

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,962
‐ Merritt, you don't know
what that's gonna do.

13
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:30,097
‐ You're right.

14
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:34,101
‐ Ever since I found this page,
I knew it was important.

15
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:36,203
‐ It's an instruction manual.
‐ For what?

16
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:37,037
‐ The World Seed.

17
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,605
It can grow
into almost anything,

18
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:40,307
even an entire world.

19
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,142
The Couple has been looking
for the World Seed page

20
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:44,611
a long time,
and they are not good people.

21
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:46,613
‐ And they know
I have what they want.

22
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:48,348
‐ Pregnant.

23
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:49,116
‐ Shit.

24
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:49,917
Really appreciate it
if we could

25
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,618
keep this between you and I.

26
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:52,386
‐ Of course.

27
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:56,990
‐ Let's go find our books,
shall we?

28
00:00:57,024 --> 00:00:59,159
‐ You better be able
to speed‐read.

29
00:01:00,327 --> 00:01:02,029
‐ No!

30
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,063
‐ Okay, so what if
we locate the tree

31
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:04,965
from Seb's tattoo
and chop it down?

32
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:06,300
Would that sever this conduit?

33
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:08,268
‐ In theory, yes,

34
00:01:08,302 --> 00:01:11,471
he would be mortal
and 100% stabbable.

35
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:23,517
‐ Jesus, cock and balls,
what's keeping Julia and El?

36
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,352
We just murdered
the goddamn king back there.

37
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:26,353
They should act like it.
‐ Ooh, sorry.

38
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,255
Probably just
Julia's toe worms.

39
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:30,591
Hey, we should stop
so she can catch up.

40
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,458
‐ You've got toe worms,

41
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,160
and you're moving
at a normal speed.

42
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:34,661
‐ Oh, I'm just used to‐‐

43
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:36,330
Hey, what happened to your eye?

44
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:38,231
‐ I lent it to Josh.

45
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,534
‐ What happened to his eye?

46
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,269
‐ Nothing!
He's an idiot.

47
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:43,837
He went back to warn
Tick and Rafe to get out

48
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,672
before things go shit‐shaped.
‐ Okay.

49
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,441
‐ Wait, and so why did you‐‐

50
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:51,011
‐ I'm worried, so I'm
keeping an eye on him, okay?

51
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,412
Christ.
‐ Oh, it's a pun.

52
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,348
I get it,
'cause you gave him your eye.

53
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:56,483
‐ Shut the fuck up, Fen!

54
00:01:58,151 --> 00:01:59,486
‐ Okay.

55
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:04,191
‐ Julia, you have to hurry.
Are you okay?

56
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:06,226
‐ Yeah, I'm just
a little out of shape.

57
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:08,261
‐ Okay, don't mean to push,
but since we don't know

58
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,197
how the Centurions
will react to Seb's body,

59
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,532
and you were intimately
involved in making him dead,

60
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:14,768
we should probably
move more quickly.

61
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,703
‐ Uh...Eliot.

62
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:21,708
‐ I wouldn't if I were you.

63
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:25,812
‐ Seb.

64
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:27,447
‐ Surprised?

65
00:02:29,249 --> 00:02:30,817
Take them.

66
00:02:40,784 --> 00:02:42,869
The Magicians S05E09
'Cello Squirrel Daffodil'

67
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:45,378
HI Parts Deleted By
DvX3M

68
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,771
‐ Shit.

69
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,210
Sorry about that, Quentin.

70
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:01,581
Lame‐ass Welters nerd.

71
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,584
‐ Merritt?

72
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:06,753
‐ What‐‐what happened?

73
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:07,888
‐ You tell me.

74
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:11,091
You said you were a Chatwin,
you ripped off your patch,

75
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,693
and then you disappeared.

76
00:03:12,726 --> 00:03:15,896
‐ Where's Julia
and‐‐and Lipson and‐‐

77
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,733
‐ You've been gone three weeks.

78
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:21,735
‐ Wha...

79
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:24,805
It was just a room.

80
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:28,208
No windows, no doors,

81
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,177
no one else there.

82
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,511
That's all I remember.

83
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:34,147
‐ You remember more than I did
when the signal grabbed me.

84
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:37,150
But I was there seconds,
at least I thought.

85
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:39,386
Who knows how this shit works?

86
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,422
‐ It's a weird one.
‐ What do your rocks say?

87
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:46,226
‐ That young Merritt
isn't under any memory curses,

88
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,361
so far as I can see.

89
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:51,465
‐ My name is actually Plum,
remember?

90
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:52,632
I just have to own it.

91
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:55,969
Leave the ranks of Chatwins
who go by middle names

92
00:03:56,002 --> 00:03:58,705
or nicknames or, you know,
super‐villain monikers.

93
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,375
Hi, Plum fucking Chatwin,
cursed freak.

94
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,912
‐ Well, on the plus,
you don't have a brain injury,

95
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:07,247
you aren't psychotic,

96
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,416
and except for
the disorientation

97
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,385
and a little bit
of combination skin,

98
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,654
you're perfectly healthy.

99
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:16,823
‐ Whoa, whoa, so‐‐what?

100
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:18,759
You're done?

101
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:20,894
‐ Well, first I'm gonna grab
a bottle of tequila

102
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,395
so that I can really enjoy

103
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,331
my post‐coma
limited work hours,

104
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:25,432
but, uh, after that,

105
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,300
yeah, I'm done.

106
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:31,738
‐ Look, this weird room,

107
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,340
that's more
than we've had to go on.

108
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:36,710
‐ It's also nothing to go on
at all.

109
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:40,914
‐ The way traveling works,

110
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,250
you imagine a place,

111
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,417
see it in your mind's eye,

112
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,520
and then just go.

113
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:48,221
What?

114
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,457
‐ You do know this is the most
you've actually taught

115
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,359
about traveling
since you took up here.

116
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:54,227
‐ Look, my point is,

117
00:04:54,261 --> 00:04:55,962
you don't have to point
on a map.

118
00:04:55,996 --> 00:04:58,398
Just picture it.

119
00:04:58,431 --> 00:04:59,366
‐ You want me to go back?

120
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,334
‐ Not really,
because it's dangerous,

121
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:02,169
but just pointing out‐‐

122
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:03,770
‐ That it's
the only thing we have,

123
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,539
is what you're pointing out.

124
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,641
‐ When I was a first year,
I had this stupid idea

125
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:10,043
that teachers knew
a ton more than me.

126
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,545
Gonna blow it for you.

127
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:13,713
Pretty much no one
knows dick about anything,

128
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:15,715
especially traveler shit.

129
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:17,584
What the signal is, why,

130
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:18,919
no one's waiting around
to solve it.

131
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:21,922
‐ But I've never
traveled by myself,

132
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:23,023
and I don't know how,

133
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:26,426
and even assuming you're not
completely a shit teacher,

134
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,395
I can't go back there,
not alone.

135
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:29,763
‐ You won't be.

136
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,168
‐ Oh, you stupid twat.

137
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:36,903
That hurts.

138
00:05:36,937 --> 00:05:39,406
‐ Kind of late to ask
for the anesthesia spell.

139
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:43,577
‐ Done.

140
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,313
Now you can take people
with you when you travel,

141
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,381
which is why it is important
that you‐‐

142
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,350
‐ Yes, I read the chapters
you gave me.

143
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:52,652
I get the principles.

144
00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:54,588
‐ We start with baby steps.

145
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:57,524
All you gotta do is travel us
both across the lab.

146
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:59,526
Now, I'm gonna draw a circle.

147
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:02,295
Just aim for it.

148
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:03,597
And don't worry.

149
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,932
If you get lost,
I'll be right there.

150
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:08,335
‐ Professor Adiyodi...
‐ It's Penny.

151
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,636
‐ Bringing you my troubles

152
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,037
has cocked things up
enough already.

153
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:13,373
I don't wanna make things
worse.

154
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:15,308
‐ Yeah, well,
messing up my life

155
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:16,009
kind of runs in your family.

156
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,477
I'm used to it.

157
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,745
‐ You're not convincing me.

158
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:23,884
‐ Which Chatwin are you
related to?

159
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:26,353
‐ Honestly, I don't know.

160
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,454
My parents are British.

161
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:28,255
They have the proper sense

162
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:30,557
not to speak
of the family curse.

163
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:32,592
‐ Well, you are the third
Chatwin I've met.

164
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:34,594
First one was The Beast,

165
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:36,830
who basically tortured me
when I was a kid,

166
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:38,965
but his sister Jane,

167
00:06:38,999 --> 00:06:41,034
she did everything she could
to stop him.

168
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:44,137
She changed time.

169
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,539
She was incredible.

170
00:06:46,573 --> 00:06:49,809
So family curse?

171
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:52,045
Far as I'm concerned,
the scales are even.

172
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,213
You could tip it either way.

173
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:58,952
Remember, aim for the circle.

174
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,990
Here goes nothing.

175
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,696
I did it.
I actually did it.

176
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,998
I honestly thought I was
just gonna, like, kill us both.

177
00:07:12,032 --> 00:07:13,833
Like, straight up
50/50 chance‐‐

178
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:16,770
‐ Plum.
‐ Yeah.

179
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:17,871
‐ Where's the chalk circle?

180
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:20,840
‐ It‐‐it's‐‐huh?

181
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,614
‐ Hey, where's everybody going?

182
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:30,684
‐ Dean Shiring got dial‐up
in the computer closet.

183
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,686
We're gonna use it
to read the Starr Report,

184
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:34,721
or at least the blow job parts.

185
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:36,623
‐ Dial‐up?
‐ Starr Report?

186
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:39,693
That came out‐‐oh.
‐

187
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:42,462
I traveled us to 1998.

188
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:45,198
‐ Yeah, well,
I have a strong guess

189
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,900
which Chatwin
you're related to.

190
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:50,136
‐ "The Couple"?
Never heard of 'em.

191
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,604
‐ I hadn't either
until they sent

192
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:54,474
a shiitake monster after me.

193
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:55,308
I'd like to know who they are

194
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:57,110
before they come
looking for me again.

195
00:07:58,778 --> 00:08:00,714
‐ Well, I know a guy.

196
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:01,915
He owes me, like, three favors,

197
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:03,750
so let's see.

198
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:04,584
‐ Thanks, Kady.

199
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,089
‐ Now you owe me three favors.
‐ Hmm.

200
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,393
‐ He wants to meet.

201
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:19,733
You are never
gonna believe where.

202
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,436
What the hell happened here?

203
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:25,605
‐ We've been redecorating.

204
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:28,608
Alice and Kady,
I'm so very glad you've come.

205
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:30,477
‐ Zelda.
‐ What are you doing here?

206
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,911
‐ Rebuilding.

207
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:33,213
Come to see George, yes?

208
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:35,582
‐ Didn't know you knew him.

209
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,684
‐ Hmm.
He's right over there.

210
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:38,685
‐ Oh.

211
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:42,188
‐ Hey, how did all this happen?

212
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:44,758
Are those hedges
working with librarians?

213
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,093
‐ Honestly, it was you.

214
00:08:47,127 --> 00:08:48,928
After you helped me
burn all those books,

215
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:49,863
I realized the Library

216
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,098
needed to be rebuilt
from the ground up.

217
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:53,867
‐ How did you convince them
to help you?

218
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,568
‐ I've been helping
Kady and Harriet

219
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:56,569
remove Reed's Marks‐‐

220
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:58,938
a sort of penance,
if we're being honest‐‐

221
00:08:58,972 --> 00:09:00,607
but suddenly I found myself
surrounded

222
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,109
by grateful magicians just
looking for something to do.

223
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:05,745
‐ What was that?

224
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,947
‐ Our new recruits
are enthusiastic,

225
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:09,949
but their education is spotty.

226
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:12,619
This branch is kept functioning
by very specific spells,

227
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,654
but proper casting,
especially here

228
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:16,823
in the Circumstances
of the Neitherlands,

229
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,124
sometimes eludes them.

230
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:21,861
‐ Alice, this is George.

231
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,064
‐ So you're the one
The Couple's after.

232
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:24,798
‐ Do you know them?

233
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:27,534
‐ No, but I know
a guy who might.

234
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,669
I need a day to track him down.

235
00:09:30,837 --> 00:09:32,639
‐ Thanks, George.

236
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:33,840
Two favors to go.

237
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:37,610
‐ As long as your waiting,

238
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:39,579
perhaps you could help us
with a problem?

239
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,247
I've pulled some volumes
from the Poison Room.

240
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:42,982
Highly dangerous.

241
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:45,885
You're some of the few
I trust to look through them.

242
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,720
‐ What are you looking for?

243
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:48,855
‐ A way to fix magic.

244
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:54,527
Unless you have something
more important to do.

245
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:57,997
‐ Oh.

246
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:01,801
‐ Thank God we got past
the Centurions.

247
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:03,837
‐ How the hell's
the Dark King still alive?

248
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,872
We cut down his tree,
stabbed him.

249
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,173
‐ It doesn't seem possible.

250
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:08,608
‐ El said he's a healer.

251
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:09,642
Maybe he cast something
with his last breath.

252
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:13,079
I don't know,
but our friends are back there.

253
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:17,584
I can see Josh hiding out,
so he's safe for now,

254
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,085
but Julia and Eliot...

255
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,189
‐ Did they get back here
before us?

256
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:30,730
‐ Hey!

257
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:32,599
Who the fuck are you?

258
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,101
‐ Ah, cello.

259
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,871
Squirrel, daffodil.

260
00:10:37,904 --> 00:10:39,305
‐ Okay.

261
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:40,507
‐ Uh, Margo,
what are you doing?

262
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,508
‐ Life lesson, Fen.

263
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,977
There's always a point
where you can decide,

264
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,879
"That's not my problem."

265
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:47,881
‐ Oh, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

266
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:51,184
‐ We have friends to save,
a Dark King to re‐kill.

267
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:54,320
Hang with Mad Libs pedophile
all you want.

268
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:56,222
I'm going back to double‐tap
the motherfucker

269
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:58,658
like he's Osama
and I'm SEAL Team Bitch.

270
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:00,660
‐ No, no.
Excelsior in springtime.

271
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,162
Excelsior in springtime.

272
00:11:02,195 --> 00:11:03,596
‐ Whatever you say.

273
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,666
‐ I think he's trying
to tell us something

274
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:09,736
about Fillory
and the Dark King?

275
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,739
‐ Charcuterie.

276
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:19,812
‐ Either he had a stroke,

277
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:21,981
or some whimsical
Fillorian shit happened to him.

278
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,017
‐ Secrets and blueberries.

279
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,119
Spongy walrus hat.

280
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:28,521
‐ On the edge
of the Burnt River,

281
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:30,757
there's an insect called
the Tongue Twister

282
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,259
that supposedly
crawls into your skull

283
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:33,993
and confuses your words.

284
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,929
Is that like a stroke?

285
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:37,263
‐ Fingernail clippings.

286
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:39,165
‐ Hold up.

287
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:40,934
Somebody's near Josh.

288
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:42,969
Son of a shit,
it's the Dark King.

289
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:44,170
He's coming.

290
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:46,339
Wait, no!
God damn it!

291
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,140
‐ What happened?

292
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:48,841
‐ Josh put my eye
in his pocket,

293
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,343
so I can't see shit.

294
00:11:51,144 --> 00:11:54,714
If he's got something to say
about the Dark King,

295
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:56,282
we need to know it.

296
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:57,684
‐ How?

297
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,185
If he's got Tongue Twisters
in his brain hole?

298
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:00,220
‐ I know a guy.

299
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:01,955
He's an idiot,

300
00:12:01,988 --> 00:12:04,157
but he might be able to help.

301
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,663
‐ Professor Fogg?

302
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,132
‐ Hi.

303
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:14,834
‐ Ski masks.

304
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:18,037
Big trend in the future?

305
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,739
‐ Trying to avoid
a time paradox.

306
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:22,875
‐ Ah, smart and stupid.

307
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,777
You don't think I'll recognize
your voices?

308
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:26,412
‐ Kind of counted on you
being a little drunk.

309
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:27,914
‐ Hmm.

310
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:28,982
‐ It's the afternoon.

311
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:31,985
‐ Next time,
try Pinter's facial distortion,

312
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:33,820
literally made
for this sort of thing,

313
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:36,823
unless you, you know,
prefer this look.

314
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:40,159
‐ Yeah, look, what do you know
about time travelers?

315
00:12:41,694 --> 00:12:42,762
They're a myth.

316
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:45,231
‐ And yet, here we are.

317
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:50,103
‐ Well, seems like you have
a gift, Ms. Ski Mask,

318
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,005
but poor aim.

319
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:53,873
‐ Can you help?

320
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:56,042
‐ Maybe.

321
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:02,048
This time bridge is set
for a fixed moment in time,

322
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:06,185
but we can remove
the temporal compass

323
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:11,057
and adjust it to help you
navigate back to 2020.

324
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,859
Can you feel the vibration?
‐ Yeah.

325
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,028
‐ Good.
It's pointing towards home.

326
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:16,029
‐ Thanks, Professor Fogg.

327
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:18,131
‐ No, gosh,
thank you, thank you.

328
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,366
This might all make
an excellent dissertation.

329
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,201
‐ Might even be worth
a promotion.

330
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:23,469
‐ Oh, God, no.

331
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:24,871
Me, Dean?
No.

332
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:28,207
I'd have to pay off
a lot of colleagues' wives.

333
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:31,611
Good luck.

334
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:42,155
‐ Did it work?

335
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:43,823
Are we back?

336
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:45,191
‐ I don't know.

337
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:55,902
‐ Excuse me.

338
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:57,904
Be a pal and sweep up
the men's dining room?

339
00:13:57,937 --> 00:13:58,938
Thanks.

340
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:02,241
‐ Nope.

341
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,112
‐ How is Seb still alive?

342
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:07,113
‐ I have no idea.

343
00:14:07,146 --> 00:14:10,283
I mean, you saw me
run him through with a sword,

344
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,585
which is not something
I expected to do

345
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:15,121
to anyone, kind of ever.

346
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:19,659
‐ You okay?

347
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,195
‐ Yeah, um,
I just have a problem,

348
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:23,796
and it's getting worse.

349
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:32,338
‐ How'd you get so pregnant?

350
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:35,508
‐ The usual way,
except it's Red Monkey Month,

351
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,111
so everything grows
a lot faster.

352
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:41,280
‐ I guess...

353
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:42,815
congratulations?

354
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:48,388
‐ Thanks, I think.

355
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:49,856
‐ Present deal aside,

356
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,924
the whole circle of life
of this,

357
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,559
it's kind of very moving.

358
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:55,628
‐ In a far less
dungeon‐y timeline,

359
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:57,497
I'd definitely be asking you

360
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,532
to throw me a baby shower
right about now.

361
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,934
‐ I know a spell
to make sparkling cider

362
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:03,169
get you hammered.

363
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,070
Perfect loophole
for this situation.

364
00:15:05,605 --> 00:15:07,640
‐ Glad to see you're
keeping your spirits up.

365
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:10,543
I wouldn't want it
gloomy down here.

366
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,246
And now I've killed
the conversation.

367
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,484
‐ Are you going to execute us?

368
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:20,753
‐ I can't.

369
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:22,321
I need your help.

370
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,093
‐ Basic problem's the same.

371
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:29,595
We can't fix magic on Earth.

372
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:32,532
We did some stuff to the moon,
and she's mad, and she's‐‐

373
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:36,169
‐ A monumental cunt?
‐ Evidently.

374
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:38,204
So she's screwing up
Circumstances.

375
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,509
‐ My Akkadian's rusty,
but I‐‐I think this says

376
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:48,915
that we can win
the moon's favor if we...

377
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,416
‐ Virgin sacrifice.

378
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,885
‐ Okay, well, that's out.

379
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:53,686
‐ Not to mention,

380
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:56,055
the method of death
is pretty gross.

381
00:15:58,391 --> 00:15:59,258
‐ That bad, huh?

382
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,427
‐ No, it's just
the lights flickered,

383
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:05,264
and now there's peanut butter
in my turkey sandwich.

384
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,235
‐ Thought wonky casting
was an Earth‐specific problem.

385
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:11,904
‐ I think this issue's
more basic.

386
00:16:11,938 --> 00:16:14,006
All the new people
learning Library operations,

387
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,375
including culinary charms.

388
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:19,712
‐ At least Zelda can reassign
hedges that cast for shit.

389
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:22,114
The moon, however,
has job security.

390
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,383
‐ Hmm.
You're fired, Moon.

391
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:28,054
Wait, what if we could?

392
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:31,157
Fire the moon, I mean.

393
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,024
‐ Kind of remember hearing

394
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,060
Earth would end
in fiery apocalypse.

395
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:36,262
‐ No, I'm saying,
what if we got rid of it

396
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:37,497
and made a new one?

397
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:41,434
That's batshit.

398
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,336
‐ This book is on
Earth‐works magic

399
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,571
in the South Pacific.

400
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:47,607
You know, how to create
an island out of nothing.

401
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,243
‐ Ye‐‐that's not exactly
the same.

402
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:52,144
‐ These books are from
the Poison Room,

403
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:53,012
not for amateurs.

404
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,580
If there's a way
to make a new moon,

405
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:55,581
it'll be in here.

406
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,425
‐ Say, "Ah."
‐ Fire engine.

407
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:10,463
‐ Well, there's your problem.
He can't talk right.

408
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:12,265
‐ No shit, Gordy.
We wanna know why.

409
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:14,600
‐ Check his ears.
Anything in there?

410
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:15,668
‐ Hmm.

411
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:18,571
Just your usual ear stuff.

412
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:21,207
Hold up, what is that?

413
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,509
Give me a minute.
It's deep in there.

414
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:27,313
And blammo.

415
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:31,651
‐ Yep, it's a Tongue Twister.

416
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:33,119
‐ How you feeling now?

417
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,254
‐
Linoleum.

418
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:37,023
‐ Shit, it wasn't the bug.

419
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,392
‐ Huh, well,
maybe not this one.

420
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:41,694
There's a bunch in there.

421
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,030
Hundreds.

422
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,631
Thousands.

423
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:48,200
All down his‐‐mm...

424
00:17:48,234 --> 00:17:50,069
spinal bones?

425
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:53,005
I can get 'em out
if I can keep one.

426
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,141
‐ Sure I'll regret asking.
Why?

427
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,076
‐ For the respect.

428
00:17:57,109 --> 00:18:00,246
So I can write a...
a...

429
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,715
‐ Paper?
‐ Right, one of those.

430
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,051
It'd be huge for me.

431
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,586
I'll never get laughed at
at VetCon again.

432
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:08,554
‐ How long is it gonna take?

433
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,489
‐ Don't know.

434
00:18:10,523 --> 00:18:13,693
Looks like each critter
has an energy‐meridian tether

435
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:15,595
as well as a physical one.

436
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:16,729
It's like he's possessed

437
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:20,032
by a thousand little spirits,
so...

438
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:21,734
‐ This is a possession problem?

439
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,669
‐ No, it's a bug problem,

440
00:18:23,703 --> 00:18:25,972
and those bugs
are possessing him.

441
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,045
‐ Don't worry.
I deal with cats all day.

442
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:35,181
They are possessed
like you wouldn't believe.

443
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:36,415
‐ Rhubarb.

444
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,524
‐ That should do it.

445
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:48,094
‐ He's bleeding out!
Call a doctor!

446
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:51,263
Oh, yeah.

447
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:58,738
‐ 1920.

448
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:01,874
‐ Maybe Fogg flipped a digit
setting it.

449
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:03,409
If we can figure out
what he got wrong,

450
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:05,144
we can fix his mistake.

451
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:08,280
I just wish we had
some instructions.

452
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,216
‐ Excuse me.

453
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:13,219
This area is for students
and faculty only.

454
00:19:13,252 --> 00:19:14,887
‐ I am faculty.
‐ I'm a student.

455
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,124
‐ And I am the King of Siam.
Out.

456
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,125
‐ Look, dude,
I don't know wha‐‐

457
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:20,559
‐ Yeah, getting in a fight

458
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:22,128
is only gonna make this harder.

459
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:25,564
Thank you.

460
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:36,809
‐ If we can't
get in the Library,

461
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,145
then we are stuck here
reenacting "The Help"

462
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,279
with these casually racist
white people.

463
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:42,481
‐ Lilian,
you're imagining things.

464
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,750
‐ We don't know anyone here
who can help us.

465
00:19:44,784 --> 00:19:47,086
‐ I swear, Helen,
I could sense something‐‐

466
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,856
someone‐‐
watching me in the bath,

467
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,793
like‐‐like a pervert ghost.

468
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:58,664
‐ Maybe we do know someone
who can help.

469
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:03,269
‐ "Of one not easily jealous,
but being wrought,

470
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:06,539
"perplexed in the extreme;

471
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:10,276
"of one whose hand,
like the base Indian,

472
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:13,112
threw a pearl away
richer than all his tribe..."

473
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:16,649
‐ You're telling me
this guy whacks off to people

474
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:19,318
he watches
from the Astral Plane?

475
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:23,522
‐ Yeah.
‐ "The melting mood..."

476
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,292
‐ Do we really need his help?
‐ "As the Arabian trees..."

477
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,226
‐ Look, in 100 years,

478
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,895
he's gonna be
a really nice guy, so...

479
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,566
‐ Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

480
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,167
It just, it‐‐ah.

481
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:38,537
It won't feel like "Othello"
until I'm in blackface.

482
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:42,408
‐ Okay, so he's got
a ways to go.

483
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:43,676
Hyman.

484
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:45,311
Hey.

485
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:46,746
‐ Do I know you?

486
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:51,751
‐ Uh, yeah, I'm Pen‐‐brooke,
and this is Prune.

487
00:20:51,784 --> 00:20:56,622
‐ Ah, and you are
visiting mystics?

488
00:20:56,655 --> 00:21:00,426
‐ Right, from India, and‐‐
‐ And the‐‐

489
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,094
‐ The Dark Continent.
‐ Okay.

490
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:03,729
‐ God give me strength.

491
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,731
‐ Yeah, well, listen,
we needed some help‐‐

492
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:06,999
‐ I'm sorry.
I'm late to phrenology.

493
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:08,400
‐ Okay, buddy.

494
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:11,504
Listen up, dude.

495
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:14,006
We know you're the pervert
ghost of Brakebills,

496
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:17,376
so either you help us,
or everybody knows.

497
00:21:20,813 --> 00:21:23,015
‐ I've looked through
everything Seb gave us,

498
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:26,952
and it seems like some sort
of communication spell.

499
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:28,921
It's going to take
the three of us.

500
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:34,026
I have no clue
what it does, though.

501
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:37,930
‐ El?

502
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,565
Help here?

503
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,801
‐
What's the point?

504
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:44,937
Once we're done, what reason
does he have to keep us alive?

505
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:48,407
‐ I don't think he'll kill us.

506
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,009
You.

507
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,245
I saw the way he talked to you.

508
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:55,548
Nobody is that hurt
if they don't care.

509
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,752
‐ I attract the best guys,
don't I?

510
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:03,622
‐ You attract
basically everyone,

511
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,391
and with that broad
of an appeal,

512
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:06,292
you're bound to magnetize

513
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,993
a couple of questionable
monarchs.

514
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:12,398
‐ We will figure something out.
I promise.

515
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:13,399
‐ Okay.

516
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:17,570
‐ Help.
‐ Okay.

517
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,076
‐ This sigil,
it looks sort of like

518
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,544
part of a messenger charm
that you would use

519
00:22:25,578 --> 00:22:28,347
to send a letter
across a lake or a river‐‐

520
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,415
‐ Oh, shit.

521
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:31,951
Yeah, I recognize it.

522
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:33,752
Um, it was in a book

523
00:22:33,786 --> 00:22:36,989
I was reading
right after Q died.

524
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,792
I was doing a lot of...
‐ Grief Googling?

525
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,596
‐ He wants to do a séance.

526
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:44,930
‐ But I thought
those were bullshit.

527
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:46,632
‐ Not always.

528
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:50,336
It's dark magic,
and it can go very wrong.

529
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,005
I never could figure it out,
but maybe he did.

530
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,473
‐ But why cooperative?

531
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:55,975
Three people
means a lot of power.

532
00:22:56,008 --> 00:22:58,344
‐ Well, he must be trying
to contact someone

533
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,813
who's been dead
a very long time.

534
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:02,781
‐ Oh, shit.

535
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:05,851
I think I know who.

536
00:23:12,091 --> 00:23:13,626
‐ Hello, Professor Frank.

537
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,163
‐ Those two can't be in here
during regular hours.

538
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:19,932
‐ Uh, they're with me.

539
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:22,635
I'm doing a report
on magic of the West Indies.

540
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:25,604
They are translating for me.

541
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:26,572
‐ Huh.

542
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:31,777
‐ Nothing, nothing.
There is nothing here.

543
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,712
It is all theoretical.

544
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:36,081
There's not even an entry
for a temporal compass.

545
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:37,716
‐ As far as I can tell,
time bridges

546
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,351
haven't even been
invented yet.

547
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,522
‐ Time bridges?

548
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:44,924
Like Professor Sato's work?

549
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,194
‐ Is that...

550
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,731
Hey.
‐ Yeah.

551
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,668
‐ This looks exactly like
the time bridge

552
00:23:55,701 --> 00:23:57,970
that we pulled
the compass out of.

553
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:01,106
He's building it...
‐ Today.

554
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,075
That can't be a coincidence.

555
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,210
‐ But still,
it doesn't make any sense.

556
00:24:05,244 --> 00:24:06,879
I mean, why take us here,
to today?

557
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,747
And why 1998?

558
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,783
‐ Wh‐wh‐wh‐wh‐wh...

559
00:24:10,816 --> 00:24:14,887
You traveled
to the year of our Lord 1998?

560
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,656
No, no, no.
Horsefeathers.

561
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,259
What, was the world overrun
with metal automatons

562
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,761
taking over
all the work of men?

563
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:24,596
‐ Yes.
‐ Look.

564
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:25,597
‐
Oh, my God.

565
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:27,099
‐ September, 1998.

566
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,435
‐ I was holding it
when we traveled to 1998,

567
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:32,471
and then I was
holding the compass

568
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:35,574
that was made today
when we landed here today.

569
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,910
‐ Oh, they're totems.

570
00:24:39,511 --> 00:24:42,681
Remedial traveler students
sometimes have trouble

571
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:45,751
picturing their destinations,
so holding an object

572
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:47,619
from that place
can sometimes help.

573
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:51,523
‐ Okay, so that,
but time instead of space.

574
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:53,492
So I guess in order
to get home...

575
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:54,593
‐ We need something
from our time.

576
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:57,496
‐ "From our time,"
I was gonna say that.

577
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,970
‐ Hey, you know this language?

578
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:08,974
‐ Um...

579
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:12,144
the front half looks like
Old Church Slavonic.

580
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,712
The back half,
I don't recognize it.

581
00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:15,514
‐ The Slavonic part
I could read.

582
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:18,817
It's something about a seed
that could grow into anything.

583
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:22,788
What if it could
grow into a moon?

584
00:25:31,063 --> 00:25:32,965
‐ I don't believe it.
‐ What?

585
00:25:36,001 --> 00:25:38,504
‐ This book is missing a page,

586
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,539
something called
the World Seed.

587
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:41,473
‐ How do you know
what it's about

588
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:42,975
if the page is missing?

589
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,978
‐ Because it's what
The Couple's after,

590
00:25:46,011 --> 00:25:48,914
the page, and I have it.

591
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:50,049
‐ What?

592
00:25:50,082 --> 00:25:53,552
‐ Meanwhile, we're trying
to solve a different problem,

593
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:56,321
but then‐‐but there's this book
that happens to be

594
00:25:56,355 --> 00:25:59,158
the same book that
the World Seed page came from?

595
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:01,860
Coincidence,
synchronicity, or...

596
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,695
‐ I always assume trap.

597
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:05,831
‐ How much do you
trust the hedges?

598
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:08,067
‐ About as much
as you trust the Library.

599
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,835
‐ Hmm.

600
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:12,738
Then there's no way
this isn't a con.

601
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:16,041
‐ We're looking for an answer
that requires unusual power.

602
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,177
Something unusually powerful.

603
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,946
Logically, it's gonna be rare,

604
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:22,314
a lot of people wanting it,
right?

605
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:25,884
So not weird, right?

606
00:26:27,753 --> 00:26:29,721
Just saying.
‐ True.

607
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:32,958
I mean, it can't be this easy,
can it?

608
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:35,294
‐ Maybe everything's been
really hard for a long time,

609
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:38,030
and we caught a single
fucking break for once.

610
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,935
‐ Oh, hey,
Smoothie Castle card

611
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:45,404
from 2009.

612
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:49,408
‐ So we don't have anything
from 2020?

613
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,711
Great, so we're just stuck
in this backwards‐ass place.

614
00:26:53,812 --> 00:26:55,114
‐ Did you do this?

615
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:56,014
‐ Do what?

616
00:26:56,048 --> 00:26:59,084
‐ Brakebills has given me
the icy mitt.

617
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,886
I've been streeted.

618
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:02,921
Oh, my‐‐expelled!

619
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:05,090
Someone ratted me out
to the faculty.

620
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,058
‐ Well, it wasn't us.

621
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:10,129
Someone must have overheard
our conversation.

622
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:12,397
‐ Wha‐‐eavesdropping
on a private moment?

623
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:13,165
Who would do that?

624
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:15,868
‐ You, constantly,

625
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:18,971
which is why
you're getting expelled.

626
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:24,576
‐ Did you give her permission
to use irony in this way?

627
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:28,714
Just‐‐good riddance
to the both of you.

628
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:30,816
‐ This is bad.

629
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:33,285
He was supposed to stay,
get caught projecting,

630
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,687
and then be trapped
when someone hides his body.

631
00:27:35,721 --> 00:27:38,957
‐ Okay, so then expulsion
actually saves him

632
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:42,127
from being trapped in
Astral Purgatory for a century

633
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:44,963
and saves generations
of Brakebills women

634
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:47,166
from being spied on.
‐ You don't get it.

635
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:50,169
If Hyman doesn't get trapped,
he can't help future me,

636
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:54,940
and future me can't save magic,
and we lose it forever.

637
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:58,977
We need to fix this.

638
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,312
‐
How?

639
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,482
By trapping him ourselves?

640
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,950
‐ Exactly.

641
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:07,853
‐ Wait.

642
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:19,932
On the bright side, this is my
chance to finally go to Europe.

643
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,769
I hear Weimar Berlin's
got some swell

644
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,304
"erotique" attractions.

645
00:28:26,438 --> 00:28:27,940
‐ I bet.

646
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:34,880
‐ God, what am I doing?

647
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:37,249
I came to Brakebills
to learn, you know?

648
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:40,018
And the lesson of my expulsion
is clear as a creek.

649
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:44,056
Maybe, and I know
this is crazy,

650
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:48,860
but maybe it is wrong
to spy on people in the shower.

651
00:28:48,894 --> 00:28:50,062
‐ Well...

652
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:51,363
‐ I know!

653
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,233
Then why did God
give you the ability

654
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:56,368
to spy on people in the shower?

655
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:01,139
‐ Look, I can't tell you
how to live your life, but...

656
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:06,211
Look, being a traveler
can feel like a burden, yes,

657
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:10,115
but not being a traveler,

658
00:29:10,148 --> 00:29:11,783
not being able
to use your gift,

659
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:13,018
it's worse.

660
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:14,419
Believe me.

661
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:19,825
There's no harm
in looking, right?

662
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:23,262
You know?
‐

663
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:26,398
‐ Oh.
‐ You're a good egg, Penbrooke.

664
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,432
‐ Okay.

665
00:29:29,468 --> 00:29:32,204
‐ Hey, before I forget,

666
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:34,506
any idea how I can
score some tickets

667
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:35,941
to the women's Welters match?

668
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:37,276
It's in an hour.

669
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,446
‐ Women's Welters
has a match tonight?

670
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,982
That's not on the schedule.

671
00:29:44,016 --> 00:29:46,251
‐ Oh, it's a surprise match,
yeah.

672
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:51,423
They are probably
in the locker room right now.

673
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,959
‐ Uh‐huh, uh‐huh, uh‐huh,
I see.

674
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:57,429
I am going to need
to finish packing by myself.

675
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:00,332
In private, okay?

676
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:01,967
‐ Yeah, okay. Cool.

677
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:04,603
Great.
Uh, yeah, bye.

678
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:10,742
Okay, it worked.
We only have a few minutes.

679
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:13,979
‐ Okay, um,
hear me out on something.

680
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:14,913
‐ Yes, it's bad.

681
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:16,281
Magic's at stake.

682
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:17,249
Do I have to do
the speech again?

683
00:30:17,282 --> 00:30:18,216
‐ I stole this

684
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,118
from Professor Sato's things.

685
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:22,521
Stasis charm,
freezes the wearer in time.

686
00:30:22,554 --> 00:30:25,490
‐ Plum, the body isn't
supposed to be preserved.

687
00:30:25,524 --> 00:30:27,492
It's supposed to die.
‐ Who says?

688
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:28,794
‐ No one ever found his body.

689
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:31,196
Maybe we were the ones
who hid it in the first place.

690
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:32,464
‐ That's not how time works.

691
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,965
‐
How do you know?

692
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:36,234
What matters is he'd
still be trapped

693
00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:37,202
and still be on
the Astral Plane.

694
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:39,271
‐ Unless it's
a shitty hiding spot,

695
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:40,038
and Hyman finds it.

696
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:40,939
‐ Unless he doesn't,

697
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:43,942
and 100 years from now
we can fix him.

698
00:30:43,975 --> 00:30:46,345
What's the point of having
this stupid ability

699
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:48,046
if I can't change anything?

700
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,114
‐ Who says there's a point?

701
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:50,082
You are born with this shit,

702
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:51,983
and you spend the rest
of your life

703
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,051
trying to survive it.

704
00:30:53,085 --> 00:30:54,986
Okay? Let's go.

705
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:58,657
‐ Or you have it ripped away

706
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,992
just when you figured out
you wanted it.

707
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:05,130
I am sorry your shit is broken,
but the Penny I've heard about

708
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:07,499
wouldn't give a damn whether it
fucks the future or not.

709
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,501
He would do the right thing
for his friend.

710
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,372
‐ I guess having your shit
break changes a person.

711
00:31:13,405 --> 00:31:14,973
‐ Okay,

712
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:18,210
so what kind of person
is new Penny gonna be?

713
00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:23,915
‐ Shit.

714
00:31:23,949 --> 00:31:25,450
I know how to get us
back home.

715
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:29,187
Let's do this,
and I'll explain.

716
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:30,689
‐ Okay.

717
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,991
Gonna be sore
when he wakes up.

718
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:36,528
‐ If he wakes up.

719
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,869
You ready to go?
‐ Yeah.

720
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,905
"Quentin Coldwater,
Welters"‐‐

721
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:48,907
how does that help?

722
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,442
‐ I dropped it the day
you reappeared.

723
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:53,111
When it broke, it...

724
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:54,079
‐ Became a new thing.

725
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:58,183
‐ Made the day we left,
so shall we?

726
00:31:58,216 --> 00:31:59,418
‐ Yeah.

727
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:05,657
‐ He's stable.

728
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:07,759
‐ Thank you.

729
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:09,494
‐ And talking words good.

730
00:32:09,528 --> 00:32:11,363
My work here is done.

731
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:13,098
Respect, here I come.

732
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:14,966
‐ Oh!
‐ Shit.

733
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:21,139
‐ All right, talk.

734
00:32:21,173 --> 00:32:23,341
‐ It's been centuries
since I've been able to speak.

735
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:26,278
It's so liberating.

736
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:28,346
‐ You've been infected
for centuries?

737
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:32,384
‐ Yes, from the‐‐just after
your reign ended until today.

738
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:35,020
‐ Tell us everything
that happened.

739
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:36,955
‐ Screw that.
What's up with the Dark King?

740
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:37,989
Who is he,
where does he come from,

741
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:40,058
and how do we kill him?

742
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:43,662
‐ Well, I heard
the same story you did.

743
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:46,231
The Dark King showed up

744
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:48,400
shortly after the arrival
of The Takers,

745
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:51,470
that only he
could vanquish them.

746
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:54,039
So I was curious.

747
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:55,974
Who was this Magician?

748
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:57,175
What was his story?

749
00:32:57,209 --> 00:32:59,044
So I sought him out,

750
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:01,980
and I was shocked to discover

751
00:33:02,013 --> 00:33:02,814
that I knew him.

752
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:07,219
Ooh, you are good
at telling stories.

753
00:33:07,252 --> 00:33:08,386
‐ Thank you.

754
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:12,290
Now, in order to talk
about who he is

755
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:14,593
and where he actually
came from,

756
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:16,595
we need to look further back

757
00:33:16,628 --> 00:33:20,065
to a time before Martin Chatwin
became The Beast.

758
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:21,600
‐ Really?
‐ Shh.

759
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:25,203
‐ Long before he discovered
the Wellspring,

760
00:33:25,237 --> 00:33:27,739
Martin had another plan

761
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:31,243
to make sure that he never
got sent back to Earth.

762
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:35,213
A conduit spell
to tie himself to Fillory.

763
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:37,449
‐ Once we begin, we will
only have a few moments.

764
00:33:39,618 --> 00:33:43,421
‐ Seb, we should talk
about this.

765
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:45,190
‐ Look, we know
what you're trying to do.

766
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:46,625
‐ I strongly doubt that.

767
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:47,526
‐ We know it.

768
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:48,593
The Dark King used it,

769
00:33:48,627 --> 00:33:50,695
except we chopped down
his tree.

770
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:53,465
‐ But there's an essential fact

771
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:56,401
that perhaps you don't know
about the trees of Fillory.

772
00:33:56,434 --> 00:34:00,639
You see, there are many,
but in truth, only one.

773
00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:02,641
‐ What kind of bullshit
is that?

774
00:34:02,674 --> 00:34:05,777
‐ Yeah, I mean, I'm Fillorian,
and I've never heard that.

775
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:09,214
‐ You see, the roots of
the trees of Fillory intertwine

776
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:12,250
such that they become one,
not just with each other,

777
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:15,453
but with the land,
and anyone tied to that

778
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:18,223
can't be killed by just
chopping down a single tree

779
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:20,492
or even an entire forest.

780
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:24,663
They can only be stopped
by destroying all of Fillory.

781
00:34:24,696 --> 00:34:27,165
‐ Wait, so you're saying
Martin tried,

782
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:28,300
but screwed up or whatever?

783
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:31,503
‐ He was thwarted
by someone heroic

784
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:33,238
who knew what he could become,

785
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:36,641
Martin's own brother Rupert,

786
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:39,344
Rupert Sebastian Chatwin.

787
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:42,581
‐ Oh, my Gods, what a twist.

788
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:44,316
You're such a natural at this.

789
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:46,251
‐ He realized
that the only way

790
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:48,253
to stop his brother
was sacrifice,

791
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:50,522
so he tied himself
to the conduit

792
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:51,489
before his brother could.

793
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:54,392
When Martin discovered
what had happened,

794
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,628
oh, he was furious.

795
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:59,197
He couldn't kill
his own brother,

796
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:02,534
but he could curse him
with eternal sleep.

797
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:04,636
The people of Fillory
thought he was dead.

798
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,446
‐ What's happening to him?
‐ Exactly what's meant to.

799
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:18,116
‐ What happened?

800
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:20,218
‐ You happened.

801
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:25,690
You brought surges of magic
so huge you woke Rupert up,

802
00:35:25,724 --> 00:35:27,359
and he brought The Takers,

803
00:35:27,392 --> 00:35:29,561
and then when he held them
at bay,

804
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:33,131
the Fillorians, in gratitude,
made him High King.

805
00:35:33,164 --> 00:35:37,469
‐ But why did he do all that?

806
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:41,306
‐ Yeah, if he was so good,
why did he become so evil?

807
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:44,242
‐ Because while he slumbered,

808
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:47,579
he lost the one thing
he cared about,

809
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:49,314
the man he loved.

810
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:57,322
‐ Rupert, is that really you?

811
00:35:57,355 --> 00:35:58,423
‐ Lance!

812
00:35:58,456 --> 00:35:59,824
‐ Lance?

813
00:35:59,858 --> 00:36:01,793
‐ Lance Morrison?
‐ Rupert.

814
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,600
‐ Yes, yes, it's me.

815
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:10,502
‐ Finally, you're here.

816
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:13,171
My love, my stars, my heart.

817
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:15,340
I sound like a fool.

818
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:17,842
You cannot know...

819
00:36:17,876 --> 00:36:20,412
Do you know how much
I've missed you?

820
00:36:24,382 --> 00:36:25,717
‐ What took you so long?

821
00:36:27,419 --> 00:36:28,920
‐ Lance, I've been trying.

822
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:32,924
‐ You left me.
‐ No.

823
00:36:32,957 --> 00:36:33,992
‐ You abandoned me.

824
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,194
‐ No, I needed
to stop my brother.

825
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:38,663
‐ And now I'm dead,
and you can never die.

826
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:44,269
It's cold here.
I'm so alone.

827
00:36:46,638 --> 00:36:48,540
I've almost given up
so many times.

828
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:50,809
‐ No, no, just‐‐don't.

829
00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:53,812
I will not break my promise
to you, okay?

830
00:36:53,845 --> 00:36:55,714
I finally know what to do.

831
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:57,716
We'll be together soon,
so soon.

832
00:36:57,749 --> 00:36:59,718
‐ How?
‐ Just wait by the door.

833
00:36:59,751 --> 00:37:02,654
‐ I've tried.
I can't pass through it.

834
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:04,889
‐ No, I know, but you will
be able to soon.

835
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:05,957
That's why
I reached out to you,

836
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,659
to tell you to wait
by the door.

837
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:10,395
‐
Okay, okay.

838
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:15,667
Rupert...

839
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,401
‐ Listen to me.

840
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:18,503
Wait by the door.

841
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:19,771
‐ Eliot.

842
00:37:21,306 --> 00:37:22,507
What the fuck did you do?

843
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:26,444
‐ And you actually think
this page

844
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:27,579
might contain the answer?

845
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:29,848
Tell us what you need.

846
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:31,750
Our resources
are at your disposal.

847
00:37:31,783 --> 00:37:33,351
‐ I just need to go and get it.

848
00:37:33,384 --> 00:37:34,753
‐ We'll send someone.

849
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:36,621
‐ I'd rather get it myself.

850
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:38,623
‐ A few librarians, security‐‐

851
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:40,425
seems prudent
to send one person.

852
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,394
‐ You almost had me.

853
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:46,965
Just peanut butter
and turkey sandwiches.

854
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:48,700
‐ I'm afraid I'm not following.

855
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:51,436
‐ We're in the Library,
where there's glitches

856
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:53,471
'cause of hedges right?

857
00:37:53,505 --> 00:37:54,606
So why do these glitches
keep happening

858
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:55,740
during lunar intervals?

859
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,543
Why are the Neitherlands
affected by the Earth's moon?

860
00:37:58,576 --> 00:38:00,812
Makes no sense.
Where am I really?

861
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:05,884
‐ Earth, which you manage
to figure out

862
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:07,452
every motherfucking time.

863
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:13,892
‐ What is this?
Some sort of illusion?

864
00:38:13,925 --> 00:38:15,393
‐ Psychic spell.

865
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:16,661
Basically you're in the Matrix,

866
00:38:16,694 --> 00:38:20,498
which means we're still
on Earth, hence glitches.

867
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:22,567
‐ How many times
have I done this?

868
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,468
‐ 18.

869
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,038
Been sending you back
to the beginning.

870
00:38:27,071 --> 00:38:28,239
It's getting tiresome.

871
00:38:28,273 --> 00:38:29,874
‐ Wait, the‐‐the books,
fixing the moon,

872
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:32,410
it was all just‐‐
‐ Bullshit.

873
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:35,046
Starting with you
getting Kady to text me.

874
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,314
‐ Who are you?
‐ Come on.

875
00:38:36,347 --> 00:38:38,016
I'm insulted.

876
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:40,752
You've been asking about me.

877
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:41,753
‐ The Couple.

878
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:42,720
‐ Less impressive

879
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:45,557
the 18th time
you figure it out.

880
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,558
Look, you're sick of this.

881
00:38:46,591 --> 00:38:47,659
I'm really sick of this.

882
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:51,362
Why don't we have this convo
in the real world, huh?

883
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,002
Not doing this 19 times.

884
00:38:58,036 --> 00:39:01,105
Give me the page,
or I kill Kady.

885
00:39:10,982 --> 00:39:11,649
‐ How do I know
that's really Kady?

886
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:15,286
How do I know
this is even real?

887
00:39:16,254 --> 00:39:18,556
‐ Only one way to know,

888
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:20,792
and that's to feel it.

889
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:25,563
‐ What are you doing?

890
00:39:25,597 --> 00:39:28,566
‐ Phosphoromancer, right?

891
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,801
‐ Please don't do this.

892
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:30,969
Please, please.

893
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:32,503
‐ I know you use
this finger a lot.

894
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:41,012
‐ Promise‐‐
give me the page.

895
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,414
If the finger's still viable,
I reattach.

896
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:53,658
‐ Middle finger,
also very important.

897
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:58,863
‐ Love spells
need a ring finger.

898
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,366
‐ Oh...

899
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,800
‐ Pinkies are crucial.

900
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:14,812
‐ Well? Alice?

901
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,315
‐ Okay.

902
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,051
Okay.

903
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,786
You want my thumb too?

904
00:40:24,656 --> 00:40:26,991
‐ Disappointed
that this isn't working,

905
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:29,627
because the next cut
isn't your thumb.

906
00:40:29,661 --> 00:40:31,496
It's Kady.

907
00:40:33,398 --> 00:40:35,967
‐ The page, or kill Kady.

908
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:37,769
What's it gonna be?

909
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:41,572
‐ Okay, okay, you win.
It's yours.

910
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:44,142
It's‐‐it's fucking yours.

911
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:46,077
‐ Oh, good.

912
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:49,647
‐ Relieved.

913
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:51,749
Now, where do I go?

914
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,484
Oh, hold that thought.

915
00:40:53,518 --> 00:40:55,753
I forgot my pen.

916
00:40:57,689 --> 00:40:59,991
- Okay.
- ‐

917
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,701
‐ Is he all right?

918
00:41:09,734 --> 00:41:11,736
‐ What do you care?

919
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:15,006
‐ It was never my intention
to hurt him.

920
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:17,141
‐ You think that matters?

921
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:21,879
I lost someone too.

922
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,416
And I loved him so much.

923
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:28,386
I know the pain.

924
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:31,789
It's not an excuse
to hurt people

925
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,624
just because you want him back.

926
00:41:36,728 --> 00:41:39,530
‐ Maybe you didn't love him
as much as you think,

927
00:41:39,564 --> 00:41:42,433
because you don't understand.

928
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:45,069
I have work to do.

929
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:51,876
‐ You see
what you're up against.

930
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:54,045
Fillory can never be free

931
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:57,315
so long as the Dark King
reigns.

932
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,884
‐ One thing I'm confused about.

933
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:01,819
Where do you fit in
to all of this?

934
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:05,123
‐ Well, Rupert recognized me.

935
00:42:05,156 --> 00:42:07,091
Oh, he's always disliked me.

936
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:10,495
He's the one who cursed me
with the Tongue Twisters.

937
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,897
No, I shall find
no happiness in Fillory

938
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,098
so long as he's around.

939
00:42:14,132 --> 00:42:16,534
‐ So after you leave here,
what?

940
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:18,169
Just gonna hit the streets?

941
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,971
‐ Oh, hardly.

942
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:22,507
I shall write.

943
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:27,979
The things I have seen,
the stories I can tell.

944
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:30,481
‐ His stories are very good.

945
00:42:30,515 --> 00:42:32,150
‐ Just not exactly
kid‐appropriate.

946
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:37,789
Oh, oh, oh, vexing.

947
00:42:37,822 --> 00:42:40,491
Oh, flattery flophouse.

948
00:42:42,126 --> 00:42:44,095
‐ Did you really
have to do that?

949
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:45,930
He seemed like such a nice‐‐

950
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:46,731
‐ Pedophile?

951
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:47,565
He's grooming you, Fen,

952
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:49,200
because you act like you're 12.

953
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,169
‐ Oh, Gods.

954
00:42:51,202 --> 00:42:54,138
‐ Remember, make sure to lock
on the right vibration.

955
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:00,545
‐ Can you feel it?

956
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,980
‐ Mm, it feels like home.

957
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:07,819
‐ Here we go.

958
00:43:12,557 --> 00:43:14,992
Hi.
‐

959
00:43:15,026 --> 00:43:17,895
‐ I think‐‐I think‐‐
I think we did it.

960
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,664
Should I let go of your ha‐‐

961
00:43:23,134 --> 00:43:26,037
‐ This‐‐did you‐‐

962
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:29,640
‐ No, not on purpose.

963
00:43:29,674 --> 00:43:32,577
I do‐‐I'm not sure
I even did this at all.

964
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,878
‐ Whoa, why do I feel
like I've‐‐

965
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:35,680
‐ Been here before.

966
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:37,982
Because this is it.

967
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:40,585
This is where the signal
brought us.

968
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:43,821
Okay, okay,
I'll just travel us out.

969
00:43:43,855 --> 00:43:45,189
‐ Yeah.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

970
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:50,128
‐ Plum.
‐ It's not working.

971
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:54,298
We can't leave.
