1
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:08,758
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:08,759 --> 00:00:09,939
Christopher Plover.

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,299
The children's book author?

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,579
You're familiar with my work.

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,179
I've read Martin Chatwin's book.

6
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,891
Oh, you're the pervert who
turned him into The Beast.

7
00:00:16,892 --> 00:00:19,879
The age suspension spells Martin used,

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,644
they must still be keeping me alive.

9
00:00:21,645 --> 00:00:23,759
I don't know what this signal is,

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,190
but I know why it's targeting me,

11
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:27,277
- and I'm gonna figure out...
- Whoa, whoa, hang on!

12
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:29,070
Merritt, you don't know
what that's gonna do.

13
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:30,990
You're right.

14
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,284
Ever since I found this page,
I knew it was important.

15
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:36,369
- It's an instruction manual.
- For what?

16
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,495
The World Seed.

17
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:38,871
It can grow into almost anything,

18
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,489
even an entire world.

19
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,399
The Couple has been looking for
the World Seed page a long time,

20
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,877
and they are not good people.

21
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,829
And they know I have what they want.

22
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:48,499
Pregnant.

23
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,589
Shit.

24
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,039
Really appreciate it
if we could keep this

25
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,410
- between you and I.
- Of course.

26
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,099
Let's go find our books, shall we?

27
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,309
You better be able to speed-read.

28
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,380
No!

29
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,579
Okay, so what if we locate the tree

30
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,219
from Seb's tattoo and chop it down?

31
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,482
Would that sever this conduit?

32
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,509
In theory, yes,

33
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:11,189
he would be mortal and 100% stabbable.

34
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,799
Jesus, cock and balls,
what's keeping Julia and El?

35
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,559
We just murdered the
goddamn king back there.

36
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,999
- They should act like it.
- Ooh, sorry.

37
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,469
Probably just Julia's toe worms.

38
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,839
Hey, we should stop so she can catch up.

39
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,899
You've got toe worms,

40
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,359
and you're moving at a normal speed.

41
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,979
Oh, I'm just used to...

42
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,639
Hey, what happened to your eye?

43
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,479
I lent it to Josh.

44
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,899
What happened to his eye?

45
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:42,509
Nothing! He's an idiot.

46
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,159
He went back to warn
Tick and Rafe to get out

47
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,139
- before things go shit-shaped.
- Okay.

48
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,649
Wait, and so why did you...

49
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:51,229
I'm worried, so I'm keeping
an eye on him, okay?

50
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,379
- Christ.
- Oh, it's a pun. I get it,

51
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,559
'cause you gave him your eye.

52
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,742
Shut the fuck up, Fen!

53
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,779
Okay.

54
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,489
Julia, you have to hurry. Are you okay?

55
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,499
Yeah, I'm just a little out of shape.

56
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,509
Okay, don't mean to push,
but since we don't know

57
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:10,399
how the Centurions will
react to Seb's body,

58
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,739
and you were intimately
involved in making him dead,

59
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,426
we should probably move more quickly.

60
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:17,053
Uh... Eliot.

61
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,919
I wouldn't if I were you.

62
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,104
Seb.

63
00:02:26,105 --> 00:02:27,606
Surprised?

64
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,109
Take them.

65

66
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:51,004
Shit.

67
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,261
Sorry about that, Quentin.

68
00:02:57,262 --> 00:02:58,470
_

69
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,800
Lame-ass Welters nerd.

70
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,759
Merritt?

71
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,353
What... what happened?

72
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,389
You tell me.

73
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,409
You said you were a Chatwin,
you ripped off your patch,

74
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,943
and then you disappeared.

75
00:03:12,944 --> 00:03:16,859
Where's Julia and... and Lipson and...

76
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,908
You've been gone three weeks.

77
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:21,952
Wha...

78
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:25,079
It was just a room.

79
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:28,449
No windows, no doors,

80
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,293
no one else there.

81
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:32,170
That's all I remember.

82
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:34,297
You remember more than I did
when the signal grabbed me.

83
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:37,259
But I was there seconds,
at least I thought.

84
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,479
Who knows how this shit works?

85
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,514
- It's a weird one.
- What do your rocks say?

86
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,449
That young Merritt isn't
under any memory curses,

87
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,519
so far as I can see.

88
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,979
My name is actually Plum, remember?

89
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,230
I just have to own it.

90
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,199
Leave the ranks of Chatwins
who go by middle names

91
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,947
or nicknames or, you know,
super-villain monikers.

92
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:02,533
Hi, Plum fucking Chatwin, cursed freak.

93
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:06,204
Well, on the plus,
you don't have a brain injury,

94
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:07,469
you aren't psychotic,

95
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,639
and except for the disorientation

96
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,539
and a little bit of combination skin,

97
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,879
you're perfectly healthy.

98
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:17,119
Whoa, whoa, so... what?

99
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,008
You're done?

100
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,319
Well, first I'm gonna
grab a bottle of tequila

101
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,599
so that I can really enjoy

102
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,519
my post-coma limited work hours,

103
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,820
but, uh, after that, yeah, I'm done.

104
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,959
Look, this weird room,

105
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,439
that's more than we've had to go on.

106
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,860
It's also nothing to go on at all.

107
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,109
The way traveling works,

108
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,449
you imagine a place,

109
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,575
see it in your mind's eye,

110
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:48,309
and then just go. What?

111
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,679
You do know this is the most
you've actually taught

112
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,583
about traveling since you took up here.

113
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:54,329
Look, my point is,

114
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:56,254
you don't have to point on a map.

115
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:58,539
Just picture it.

116
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,979
You want me to go back?

117
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,510
Not really, because it's dangerous,
but just pointing out...

118
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:04,199
That it's the only thing we have,

119
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,729
is what you're pointing out.

120
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:07,919
When I was a first year,
I had this stupid idea

121
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,309
that teachers knew a ton more than me.

122
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,739
Gonna blow it for you.

123
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,959
Pretty much no one knows
dick about anything,

124
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,940
especially traveler shit.

125
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,769
What the signal is, why,

126
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,193
no one's waiting around to solve it.

127
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:22,379
But I've never traveled by myself,

128
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,559
and I don't know how,

129
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,570
and even assuming you're not
completely a shit teacher,

130
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:28,589
I can't go back there, not alone.

131
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,955
You won't be.

132
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,689
Oh, you stupid twat.

133
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,379
That hurts.

134
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,779
Kind of late to ask for
the anesthesia spell.

135
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,718
Done.

136
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:46,499
Now you can take people
with you when you travel,

137
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,556
which is why it is important that you...

138
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,579
Yes, I read the chapters you gave me.

139
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,939
I get the principles.

140
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,779
We start with baby steps.

141
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,749
All you gotta do is travel
us both across the lab.

142
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,692
Now, I'm gonna draw a circle.

143
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:02,399
Just aim for it.

144
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,659
And don't worry.

145
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,157
If you get lost, I'll be right there.

146
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:08,689
- Professor Adiyodi...
- It's Penny.

147
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:09,779
Bringing you my troubles

148
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,329
has cocked things up enough already.

149
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:14,372
- I don't wanna make things worse.
- Yeah, well,

150
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:16,459
messing up my life kind
of runs in your family.

151
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,669
I'm used to it.

152
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,296
You're not convincing me.

153
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,259
Which Chatwin are you related to?

154
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,649
Honestly, I don't know.

155
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,699
My parents are British.

156
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,709
They have the proper sense

157
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,723
not to speak of the family curse.

158
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,684
Well, you are the third
Chatwin I've met.

159
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,063
First one was The Beast,
who basically tortured me

160
00:06:36,064 --> 00:06:39,159
when I was a kid, but his sister Jane,

161
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,379
she did everything
she could to stop him.

162
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,769
She changed time.

163
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,759
She was incredible.

164
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,999
So family curse?

165
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,239
Far as I'm concerned,
the scales are even.

166
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,664
You could tip it either way.

167
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:59,210
Remember, aim for the circle.

168
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,240
Here goes nothing.

169
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,919
I did it. I actually did it.

170
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,259
I honestly thought I was just
gonna, like, kill us both.

171
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,017
Like, straight up 50/50 chance...

172
00:07:14,018 --> 00:07:15,309
Plum.

173
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,969
Yeah.

174
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,104
Where's the chalk circle?

175
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:21,100
It... it's... huh?

176
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,197
Hey, where's everybody going?

177
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:30,879
Dean Shiring got dial-up
in the computer closet.

178
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,879
We're gonna use it to
read the Starr Report,

179
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,909
or at least the blow job parts.

180
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,320
- Dial-up?
- Starr Report? Thank you...

181
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,759
- That came out...
- Oh.

182
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,586
I traveled us to 1998.

183
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:45,619
Yeah, well, I have a strong guess

184
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,169
which Chatwin you're related to.

185
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:50,428
"The Couple"? Never heard of 'em.

186
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:51,829
I hadn't either until they sent

187
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:54,589
a shiitake monster after me.

188
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:55,719
I'd like to know who they are

189
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,370
before they come looking for me again.

190
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,909
Well, I know a guy.

191
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,299
He owes me, like, three favors,

192
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,439
so let's see.

193
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,068
Thanks, Kady.

194
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,363
- Now you owe me three favors.
- Hmm.

195
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:13,827
He wants to meet.

196
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,874
You are never gonna believe where.

197
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,545
What the hell happened here?

198
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,199
We've been redecorating.

199
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,869
Alice and Kady, I'm so
very glad you've come.

200
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:30,593
- Zelda.
- What are you doing here?

201
00:08:30,594 --> 00:08:32,099
Rebuilding.

202
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,430
Come to see George, yes?

203
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:35,765
Didn't know you knew him.

204
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:37,850
Hmm. He's right over there.

205
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:38,909
Oh.

206
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,469
Hey, how did all this happen?

207
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:44,940
Are those hedges working
with librarians?

208
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,319
Honestly, it was you.

209
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,539
After you helped me
burn all those books,

210
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,448
I realized the Library
needed to be rebuilt

211
00:08:51,465 --> 00:08:52,480
from the ground up.

212
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,073
How did you convince them to help you?

213
00:08:54,074 --> 00:08:55,789
I've been helping Kady and Harriet

214
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,919
remove Reed's Marks...

215
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,219
a sort of penance,
if we're being honest...

216
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,799
but suddenly I found myself surrounded

217
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,334
by grateful magicians just
looking for something to do.

218
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,299
What was that?

219
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,139
Our new recruits are enthusiastic,

220
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,139
but their education is spotty.

221
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,718
This branch is kept functioning
by very specific spells,

222
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,919
but proper casting, especially here

223
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,009
in the Circumstances
of the Neitherlands,

224
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,349
sometimes eludes them.

225
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:22,089
Alice, this is George.

226
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:24,289
So you're the one The Couple's after.

227
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,314
Do you know them?

228
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,649
No, but I know a guy who might.

229
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,120
I need a day to track him down.

230
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,829
Thanks, George.

231
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,100
Two favors to go.

232
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,785
As long as your waiting,

233
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:39,703
perhaps you could help
us with a problem?

234
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,539
I've pulled some volumes
from the Poison Room.

235
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,579
Highly dangerous.

236
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,079
You're some of the few
I trust to look through them.

237
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,878
What are you looking for?

238
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,422
A way to fix magic.

239
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,590
Unless you have something
more important to do.

240
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,460
Oh.

241
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,976
Thank God we got past the Centurions.

242
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:04,129
How the hell's the
Dark King still alive?

243
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,059
We cut down his tree, stabbed him.

244
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,395
It doesn't seem possible.

245
00:10:07,396 --> 00:10:08,640
El said he's a healer.

246
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,229
Maybe he cast something
with his last breath.

247
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:13,280
I don't know, but our
friends are back there.

248
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,779
I can see Josh hiding out,
so he's safe for now,

249
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,286
but Julia and Eliot...

250
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,370
Did they get back here before us?

251
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:30,880
Hey!

252
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:32,819
Who the fuck are you?

253
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,359
Ah, cello.

254
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,009
Squirrel, daffodil.

255
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,089
- Okay.
- Uh,

256
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:41,219
Margo, what are you doing?

257
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,459
Life lesson, Fen.

258
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,539
There's always a point
where you can decide,

259
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,069
"That's not my problem."

260
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,019
Oh, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

261
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,660
We have friends to save,
a Dark King to re-kill.

262
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,620
Hang with Mad Libs
pedophile all you want.

263
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,479
I'm going back to
double-tap the motherfucker

264
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,780
like he's Osama and I'm SEAL Team Bitch.

265
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,784
No, no. Excelsior in springtime.

266
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,719
- Excelsior in springtime.
- Whatever you say.

267
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,919
I think he's trying to tell us something

268
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,794
about Fillory and the Dark King?

269
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,880
Charcuterie.

270
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,119
Either he had a stroke,

271
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,679
or some whimsical Fillorian
shit happened to him.

272
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,225
Yes. Secrets and blueberries.

273
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:26,311
Spongy walrus hat.

274
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,099
On the edge of the Burnt River,

275
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,009
there's an insect called
the Tongue Twister

276
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:33,509
that supposedly crawls into your skull

277
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,527
and confuses your words.

278
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:36,139
Is that like a stroke?

279
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,529
Fingernail clippings.

280
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,449
Hold up.

281
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,116
Somebody's near Josh.

282
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,202
Son of a shit, it's the Dark King.

283
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,419
He's coming.

284
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,622
Wait, no! God damn it!

285
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:49,059
- What happened?
- Josh put my eye in his pocket,

286
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,585
so I can't see shit.

287
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,029
If he's got something to
say about the Dark King,

288
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,507
we need to know it.

289
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:57,679
How?

290
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,426
If he's got Tongue Twisters
in his brain hole?

291
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,511
I know a guy.

292
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:02,096
He's an idiot,

293
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:04,307
but he might be able to help.

294
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,730
Professor Fogg?

295
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,357
Hi.

296
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,150
Ski masks.

297
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,237
Big trend in the future?

298
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,863
Trying to avoid a time paradox.

299
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:23,049
Ah, smart and stupid.

300
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,994
You don't think I'll
recognize your voices?

301
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:26,704
Kind of counted on you
being a little drunk.

302
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:28,080
Hmm.

303
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,540
It's the afternoon.

304
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:32,319
Next time, try Pinter's
facial distortion,

305
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,069
literally made for this sort of thing,

306
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,959
unless you, you know, prefer this look.

307
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,758
Yeah, look, what do you know

308
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,559
about time travelers?

309
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,886
They're a myth.

310
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,472
And yet, here we are.

311
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:50,389
Well, seems like you have
a gift, Ms. Ski Mask,

312
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,187
but poor aim.

313
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,940
Can you help?

314
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,192
Maybe.

315
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:02,499
This time bridge is set for
a fixed moment in time,

316
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,410
but we can remove the temporal compass

317
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:10,949
and adjust it to help you
navigate back to 2020.

318
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,019
- Can you feel the vibration?
- Yeah.

319
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,339
Good. It's pointing towards home.

320
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,503
Thanks, Professor Fogg.

321
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,409
No, gosh, thank you, thank you.

322
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,591
This might all make an
excellent dissertation.

323
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:22,579
Might even be worth a promotion.

324
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,899
Oh, God, no.

325
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,509
Me, Dean? No.

326
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,459
I'd have to pay off a lot
of colleagues' wives.

327
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:31,930
Good luck.

328
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,899
Did it work?

329
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,939
Are we back?

330
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,580
I don't know.

331
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,279
Excuse me.

332
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,045
Be a pal and sweep up
the men's dining room?

333
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,250
Thanks.

334
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:02,790
Nope.

335
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,299
How is Seb still alive?

336
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,659
I have no idea.

337
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,569
I mean, you saw me run him
through with a sword,

338
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,979
which is not something I expected to do

339
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,180
to anyone, kind of ever.

340
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:20,139
You okay?

341
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,479
Yeah, um, I just have a problem,

342
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,822
and it's getting worse.

343
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,859
How'd you get so pregnant?

344
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:35,899
The usual way, except
it's Red Monkey Month,

345
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,752
so everything grows a lot faster.

346
00:14:37,753 --> 00:14:41,529
I guess...

347
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,099
congratulations?

348
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,669
- Ugh.
- Thanks, I think.

349
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:50,079
Present deal aside,

350
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,479
the whole circle of life of this,

351
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,879
it's kind of very moving.

352
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,940
In a far less dungeon-y timeline,

353
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,899
I'd definitely be asking you

354
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,809
to throw me a baby
shower right about now.

355
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:02,219
I know a spell to make sparkling cider

356
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,349
get you hammered.

357
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,999
Perfect loophole for this situation.

358
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:07,907
Glad to see you're
keeping your spirits up.

359
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,826
I wouldn't want it gloomy down here.

360
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:13,489
And now I've killed the conversation.

361
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,160
Are you going to execute us?

362
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:21,139
I can't.

363
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,504
I need your help.

364
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,259
Basic problem's the same.

365
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,879
We can't fix magic on Earth.

366
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,804
We did some stuff to the
moon, and she's mad,

367
00:15:32,805 --> 00:15:35,119
- and she's...
- A monumental cunt?

368
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,309
Evidently.

369
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,800
So she's screwing up Circumstances.

370
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,719
My Akkadian's rusty, but I...

371
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:49,031
I think this says that we can
win the moon's favor if we...

372
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:50,657
Virgin sacrifice.

373
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,993
Okay, well, that's out.

374
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:56,164
Not to mention, the method
of death is pretty gross.

375
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,579
Ugh.

376
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,779
- That bad, huh?
- No, it's just the lights flickered,

377
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:05,423
and now there's peanut butter
in my turkey sandwich.

378
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,468
Thought wonky casting was
an Earth-specific problem.

379
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:12,129
I think this issue's more basic.

380
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,269
All the new people learning
Library operations,

381
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,558
including culinary charms.

382
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,099
At least Zelda can reassign
hedges that cast for shit.

383
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,270
The moon, however, has job security.

384
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,649
Hmm. You're fired, Moon.

385
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,112
Wait, what if we could?

386
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:30,572
Fire the moon, I mean.

387
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,559
Kind of remember hearing

388
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,159
Earth would end in fiery apocalypse.

389
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,559
No, I'm saying, what if we got rid of it

390
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,747
and made a new one?

391
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,291
That's batshit.

392
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,699
This book is on Earth-works magic

393
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,799
in the South Pacific.

394
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,881
You know, how to create
an island out of nothing.

395
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,842
Ye... that's not exactly the same.

396
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:52,409
These books are from the Poison Room,

397
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,470
not for amateurs.

398
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,806
If there's a way to make a
new moon, it'll be in here.

399
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,901
- Say, "Ah."
- Fire engine.

400
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,689
Well, there's your problem.
He can't talk right.

401
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,447
No shit, Gordy. We wanna know why.

402
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,829
Check his ears. Anything in there?

403
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:15,969
Hmm.

404
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,954
Just your usual ear stuff.

405
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,829
Hold up, what is that?

406
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:23,710
Give me a minute. It's deep in there.

407
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,422
And blammo.

408
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,919
Yep, it's a Tongue Twister.

409
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,159
How you feeling now?

410
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,429
Linoleum.

411
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:37,139
Shit, it wasn't the bug.

412
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,659
Huh, well, maybe not this one.

413
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,959
There's a bunch in there.

414
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,146
Hundreds.

415
00:17:44,147 --> 00:17:45,869
Thousands.

416
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:48,499
All down his... mm...

417
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,193
spinal bones?

418
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,113
I can get 'em out if I can keep one.

419
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:55,282
Sure I'll regret asking. Why?

420
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:57,339
For the respect.

421
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,412
So I can write a... a...

422
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,581
- Paper?
- Right, one of those.

423
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:05,167
It'd be huge for me.

424
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:06,836
I'll never get laughed
at at VetCon again.

425
00:18:06,837 --> 00:18:10,719
- How long is it gonna take?
- Don't know.

426
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,929
Looks like each critter has
an energy-meridian tether

427
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,859
as well as a physical one.

428
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:19,766
It's like he's possessed by a
thousand little spirits, so...

429
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:22,017
This is a possession problem?

430
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:23,935
No, it's a bug problem,

431
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,064
and those bugs are possessing him.

432
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,349
Don't worry. I deal with cats all day.

433
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:35,280
They are possessed like
you wouldn't believe.

434
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,750
Rhubarb.

435
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,239
That should do it.

436
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,390
He's bleeding out! Call a doctor!

437
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,560
Oh, yeah.

438
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,720
1920.

439
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:02,139
Maybe Fogg flipped a digit setting it.

440
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,679
If we can figure out what he got wrong,

441
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,300
we can fix his mistake.

442
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,549
I just wish we had some instructions.

443
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:10,449
Excuse me.

444
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:13,360
This area is for students
and faculty only.

445
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:15,153
- I am faculty.
- I'm a student.

446
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,240
And I am the King of Siam. Out.

447
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:19,659
Look, dude, I don't know wha...

448
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,819
Yeah, getting in a fight

449
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,203
is only gonna make this harder.

450
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,707
Thank you.

451
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:37,199
If we can't get in the Library,

452
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,409
then we are stuck here
reenacting "The Help"

453
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,039
with these casually racist white people.

454
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,399
Lilian, you're imagining things.

455
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,979
We don't know anyone
here who can help us.

456
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,619
I swear, Helen,
I could sense something...

457
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:51,119
someone... watching me in the bath,

458
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,026
like... like a pervert ghost.

459
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:58,865
Maybe we do know someone who can help.

460
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,499
"Of one not easily jealous,
but being wrought,

461
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,747
"perplexed in the extreme;

462
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:10,539
"of one whose hand,
like the base Indian,

463
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,179
threw a pearl away richer
than all his tribe... "

464
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:16,949
You're telling me this
guy whacks off to people

465
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,427
he watches from the Astral Plane?

466
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,720
- Yeah.
- "The melting mood... "

467
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,391
- Do we really need his help?
- "As the Arabian trees... "

468
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:27,729
Look, in 100 years,

469
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:30,187
he's gonna be a really nice guy, so...

470
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,440
Thank you, thank you, thank you,

471
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:35,499
thank you. It just, it... ah.

472
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,696
It won't feel like "Othello"
until I'm in blackface.

473
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,574
Okay, so he's got a ways to go.

474
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:43,909
Hyman.

475
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,410
Hey.

476
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:46,989
Do I know you?

477
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:51,999
Uh, yeah, I'm Pen...
brooke, and this is Prune.

478
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,889
Ah, and you are visiting mystics?

479
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:00,592
- Right, from India, and...
- And the...

480
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,302
- The Dark Continent.
- Okay.

481
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:03,959
God give me strength.

482
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,969
Yeah, well, listen,
we needed some help...

483
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,265
I'm sorry. I'm late to phrenology.

484
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,699
Okay, buddy.

485
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,645
Listen up, dude.

486
00:21:11,646 --> 00:21:14,269
We know you're the pervert
ghost of Brakebills,

487
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:17,776
so either you help us,
or everybody knows.

488
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:23,249
I've looked through
everything Seb gave us,

489
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:27,219
and it seems like some sort
of communication spell.

490
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,163
It's going to take the three of us.

491
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:34,959
I have no clue what it does, though.

492
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:38,213
El?

493
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,756
Help here?

494
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:42,099
What's the point?

495
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,179
Once we're done, what reason
does he have to keep us alive?

496
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,709
I don't think he'll kill us.

497
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,226
You.

498
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,409
I saw the way he talked to you.

499
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,648
Nobody is that hurt if they don't care.

500
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,902
I attract the best guys, don't I?

501
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,889
You attract basically everyone,

502
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,619
and with that broad of an appeal,

503
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,759
you're bound to magnetize

504
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,579
a couple of questionable monarchs.

505
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,759
We will figure something out.

506
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,629
- I promise.
- Okay.

507
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,711
- Help.
- Okay.

508
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:24,339
This sigil, it looks sort of like

509
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,309
part of a messenger charm
that you would use

510
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,471
to send a letter across a lake

511
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,931
- or a river...
- Oh, shit.

512
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:34,299
Yeah, I recognize it.
Um, it was in a book

513
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,259
I was reading right after Q died.

514
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:40,979
- I was doing a lot of...
- Grief Googling?

515
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,778
He wants to do a séance.

516
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:45,156
But I thought those were bullshit.

517
00:22:45,157 --> 00:22:46,823
Not always.

518
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:50,569
It's dark magic, and
it can go very wrong.

519
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:53,289
I never could figure it
out, but maybe he did.

520
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,679
But why cooperative?

521
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,239
Three people means a lot of power.

522
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,609
Well, he must be trying
to contact someone

523
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,212
who's been dead a very long time.

524
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,019
Oh, shit.

525
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,052
I think I know who.

526
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,851
Hello, Professor Frank.

527
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:18,499
Those two can't be in here
during regular hours.

528
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,607
Uh, they're with me.

529
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:23,000
I'm doing a report on
magic of the West Indies.

530
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,779
They are translating for me.

531
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,079
Huh.

532
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:32,119
Nothing, nothing. There is nothing here.

533
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,859
It is all theoretical.

534
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,372
There's not even an entry
for a temporal compass.

535
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,499
As far as I can tell,

536
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,629
time bridges haven't
even been invented yet.

537
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,630
Time bridges?

538
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:45,173
Like Professor Sato's work?

539
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,720
Is that...

540
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,848
- Hey.
- Yeah.

541
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,850
This looks exactly like the time bridge

542
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,149
that we pulled the compass out of.

543
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:00,760
- He's building it...
- Today.

544
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:03,358
That can't be a coincidence.

545
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,479
But still, it doesn't make any sense.

546
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,739
I mean, why take us here, to today?

547
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,899
And why 1998?

548
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,029
Wh-wh-wh-wh-wh...

549
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:14,286
You traveled to the
year of our Lord 1998?

550
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:17,839
No, no, no. Horsefeathers.

551
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,619
What, was the world overrun
with metal automatons

552
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,336
taking over all the work of men?

553
00:24:22,337 --> 00:24:23,539
Yes.

554
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,463
- Look.
- Oh, my God.

555
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,382
September, 1998.

556
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:29,649
I was holding it when
we traveled to 1998,

557
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:32,649
and then I was holding the compass

558
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:35,719
that was made today when
we landed here today.

559
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,560
Oh, they're totems.

560
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:42,959
Remedial traveler students
sometimes have trouble

561
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,040
picturing their destinations,
so holding an object

562
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,730
from that place can sometimes help.

563
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:51,656
Okay, so that, but
time instead of space.

564
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,639
So I guess in order to get home...

565
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,119
We need something from our time.

566
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,940
"From our time," I was gonna say that.

567
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,440
Hey, you know this language?

568
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,215
Um...

569
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:12,385
the front half looks like
Old Church Slavonic.

570
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:13,889
The back half, I don't recognize it.

571
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:15,638
The Slavonic part I could read.

572
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:19,017
It's something about a seed
that could grow into anything.

573
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:22,929
What if it could grow into a moon?

574
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:33,179
- I don't believe it.
- What?

575
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,659
This book is missing a page,

576
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,663
something called the World Seed.

577
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,979
How do you know what it's about

578
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,120
if the page is missing?

579
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,259
Because it's what The Couple's after,

580
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,619
the page, and I have it.

581
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,465
What?

582
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:53,729
Meanwhile, we're trying to
solve a different problem,

583
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:56,719
but then... but there's this
book that happens to be

584
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,309
the same book that the
World Seed page came from?

585
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:02,009
Coincidence, synchronicity, or...

586
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,839
I always assume trap.

587
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,980
How much do you trust the hedges?

588
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,316
About as much as you trust the Library.

589
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:10,049
Hmm.

590
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:12,399
Then there's no way this isn't a con.

591
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,282
We're looking for an answer
that requires unusual power.

592
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,499
Something unusually powerful.

593
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,239
Logically, it's gonna be rare,

594
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,579
a lot of people wanting it, right?

595
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:26,560
So not weird, right?

596
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,869
- Just saying.
- True.

597
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:32,841
I mean, it can't be this easy, can it?

598
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:35,719
Maybe everything's been
really hard for a long time,

599
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,179
and we caught a single
fucking break for once.

600
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:45,270
Oh, hey, Smoothie Castle card from 2009.

601
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:49,691
So we don't have anything from 2020?

602
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:52,778
Great, so we're just stuck
in this backwards-ass place.

603
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,479
- Did you do this?
- Do what?

604
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,325
Brakebills has given me the icy mitt.

605
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,029
I've been streeted.

606
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:03,069
Oh, my... expelled!

607
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:05,332
Someone ratted me out to the faculty.

608
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:07,409
Well, it wasn't us.

609
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:09,712
Someone must have overheard
our conversation.

610
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,739
Wha... eavesdropping
on a private moment?

611
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,756
Who would do that?

612
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:16,050
You, constantly,

613
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:19,096
which is why you're getting expelled.

614
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:24,959
Did you give her permission
to use irony in this way?

615
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,855
Just... good riddance
to the both of you.

616
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:31,099
This is bad.

617
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,799
He was supposed to stay,
get caught projecting,

618
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,820
and then be trapped when
someone hides his body.

619
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:39,209
Okay, so then expulsion
actually saves him

620
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:42,499
from being trapped in Astral
Purgatory for a century

621
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,249
and saves generations
of Brakebills women

622
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,449
- from being spied on.
- You don't get it.

623
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:49,876
If Hyman doesn't get trapped,
he can't help future me,

624
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:55,250
and future me can't save magic,
and we lose it forever.

625
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,129
We need to fix this.

626
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,539
How?

627
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,765
By trapping him ourselves?

628
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:05,059
Exactly.

629
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,937
Wait.

630
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:20,210
On the bright side, this is my
chance to finally go to Europe.

631
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,079
I hear Weimar Berlin's got some swell

632
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,620
"erotique" attractions.

633
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,250
I bet.

634
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,159
God, what am I doing?

635
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,639
I came to Brakebills to learn, you know?

636
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,176
And the lesson of my expulsion
is clear as a creek.

637
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:44,264
Maybe, and I know this is crazy,

638
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:49,018
but maybe it is wrong to spy
on people in the shower.

639
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:50,679
Well...

640
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,160
I know!

641
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,549
Then why did God give you the ability

642
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,750
to spy on people in the shower?

643
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,740
Look, I can't tell you how
to live your life, but...

644
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,460
Look, being a traveler can
feel like a burden, yes,

645
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:10,399
but not being a traveler,

646
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,899
not being able to use your gift,

647
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,469
it's worse.

648
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,610
Believe me.

649
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,967
There's no harm in looking, right?

650
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:23,509
You know?

651
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:26,899
- Oh.
- You're a good egg, Penbrooke.

652
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,940
Okay.

653
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:32,489
Hey, before I forget,

654
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:34,849
any idea how I can score some tickets

655
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,107
to the women's Welters match?

656
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,620
It's in an hour.

657
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,729
Women's Welters has a match tonight?

658
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:44,157
That's not on the schedule.

659
00:29:44,158 --> 00:29:46,410
Oh, it's a surprise match, yeah.

660
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,669
They are probably in the
locker room right now.

661
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:54,159
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, I see.

662
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:58,979
I am going to need to
finish packing by myself.

663
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:02,249
- In private, okay?
- Yeah, okay. Cool.

664
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,879
Great. Uh, yeah, bye.

665
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,239
Okay, it worked. We only
have a few minutes.

666
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,259
Okay, um, hear me out on something.

667
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,419
Yes, it's bad. Magic's at stake.

668
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,529
Do I have to do the speech again?

669
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:20,599
I stole this from
Professor Sato's things.

670
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,820
Stasis charm, freezes
the wearer in time.

671
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,859
Plum, the body isn't
supposed to be preserved.

672
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,739
- It's supposed to die.
- Who says?

673
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,409
No one ever found his body.

674
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,411
Maybe we were the ones
who hid it in the first place.

675
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:32,859
That's not how time works.

676
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,123
How do you know?

677
00:30:34,124 --> 00:30:36,549
What matters is he'd still be trapped

678
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:37,749
and still be on the Astral Plane.

679
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:40,464
Unless it's a shitty hiding
spot, and Hyman finds it.

680
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:41,679
Unless he doesn't,

681
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,060
and 100 years from now we can fix him.

682
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:46,419
What's the point of having
this stupid ability

683
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,221
if I can't change anything?

684
00:30:48,222 --> 00:30:49,639
Who says there's a point?

685
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,932
You are born with this shit,

686
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:52,299
and you spend the rest of your life

687
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,329
trying to survive it.

688
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:55,062
Okay? Let's go.

689
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,999
Or you have it ripped away

690
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,149
just when you figured out you wanted it.

691
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,979
I am sorry your shit is broken,

692
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,379
but the Penny I've heard about

693
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,779
wouldn't give a damn whether
it fucks the future or not.

694
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,743
He would do the right
thing for his friend.

695
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,619
I guess having your shit
break changes a person.

696
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,199
Okay,

697
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,560
so what kind of person
is new Penny gonna be?

698
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:25,670
Shit. I know how to get us back home.

699
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,439
Let's do this, and I'll explain.

700
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,969
Okay.

701
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:33,400
Gonna be sore when he wakes up.

702
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,840
If he wakes up.

703
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:44,060
- You ready to go?
- Yeah.

704
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:47,199
"Quentin Coldwater, Welters"...

705
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,240
how does that help?

706
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,701
I dropped it the day you reappeared.

707
00:31:50,702 --> 00:31:53,219
When it broke, it...

708
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,579
Became a new thing.

709
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:58,332
Made the day we left, so shall we?

710
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,110
Yeah.

711
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:06,959
He's stable.

712
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,210
Thank you.

713
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:11,539
And talking words good.
My work here is done.

714
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,339
Respect, here I come.

715
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,017
- Oh!
- Shit.

716
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:21,269
All right, talk.

717
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:23,549
It's been centuries since
I've been able to speak.

718
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:26,444
It's so liberating.

719
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,529
You've been infected for centuries?

720
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:32,559
Yes, from the... just after
your reign ended until today.

721
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:35,319
Tell us everything that happened.

722
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,219
Screw that. What's up
with the Dark King?

723
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,599
Who is he, where does he come from,

724
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,239
and how do we kill him?

725
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,920
Well, I heard the same story you did.

726
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:46,509
The Dark King showed up

727
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:48,749
shortly after the arrival of The Takers,

728
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:51,677
that only he could vanquish them.

729
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:54,219
So I was curious.

730
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,057
Who was this Magician?

731
00:32:56,058 --> 00:32:57,309
What was his story?

732
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:59,143
So I sought him out,

733
00:32:59,144 --> 00:33:02,063
and I was shocked to discover

734
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:03,105
that I knew him.

735
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:07,359
Ooh, you are good at telling stories.

736
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,569
Thank you.

737
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:12,599
Now, in order to talk about who he is

738
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,860
and where he actually came from,

739
00:33:14,868 --> 00:33:16,869
we need to look further back

740
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:20,164
to a time before Martin
Chatwin became The Beast.

741
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:21,819
- Really?
- Shh.

742
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:25,450
Long before he discovered
the Wellspring,

743
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:28,000
Martin had another plan

744
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:31,419
to make sure that he never
got sent back to Earth.

745
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:34,760
A conduit spell to
tie himself to Fillory.

746
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:37,979
Once we begin, we will
only have a few moments.

747
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:43,599
Seb, we should talk about this.

748
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,314
Look, we know what you're trying to do.

749
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:46,899
I strongly doubt that.

750
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,239
We know it. The Dark King used it,

751
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,945
except we chopped down his tree.

752
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:54,119
But there's an essential fact

753
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,779
that perhaps you don't know
about the trees of Fillory.

754
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:00,870
You see, there are many,
but in truth, only one.

755
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,019
What kind of bullshit is that?

756
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:06,040
Yeah, I mean, I'm Fillorian,
and I've never heard that.

757
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:09,559
You see, the roots of the
trees of Fillory intertwine

758
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,922
such that they become one,

759
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,559
not just with each other,

760
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,840
but with the land,
and anyone tied to that

761
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:18,459
can't be killed by just
chopping down a single tree

762
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,679
or even an entire forest.

763
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:24,937
They can only be stopped
by destroying all of Fillory.

764
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:27,389
Wait, so you're saying Martin tried,

765
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:28,441
but screwed up or whatever?

766
00:34:28,442 --> 00:34:31,729
He was thwarted by someone heroic

767
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:33,362
who knew what he could become,

768
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:36,869
Martin's own brother Rupert,

769
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:40,119
Rupert Sebastian Chatwin.

770
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,779
Oh, my Gods, what a twist.

771
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,457
You're such a natural at this.

772
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:46,519
He realized that the only way

773
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,449
to stop his brother was sacrifice,

774
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:50,879
so he tied himself to the conduit

775
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,040
before his brother could.

776
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:54,959
When Martin discovered
what had happened,

777
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,059
oh, he was furious.

778
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,429
He couldn't kill his own brother,

779
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,725
but he could curse him
with eternal sleep.

780
00:35:02,726 --> 00:35:04,853
The people of Fillory
thought he was dead.

781
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,690
- What's happening to him?
- Exactly what's meant to.

782
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,199
What happened?

783
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,701
You happened.

784
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:25,949
You brought surges of magic
so huge you woke Rupert up,

785
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:27,760
and he brought The Takers,

786
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:29,752
and then when he held them at bay,

787
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:33,209
the Fillorians, in gratitude,
made him High King.

788
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:37,940
But why did he do all that?

789
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:41,639
Yeah, if he was so good,
why did he become so evil?

790
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,399
Because while he slumbered,

791
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,769
he lost the one thing he cared about,

792
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,699
the man he loved.

793
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:57,446
Rupert, is that really you?

794
00:35:57,447 --> 00:35:58,649
Lance!

795
00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:00,069
Lance?

796
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,139
Lance Morrison?

797
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,577
Rupert.

798
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:08,829
Yes, yes, it's me.

799
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:10,710
Finally, you're here.

800
00:36:10,711 --> 00:36:13,369
My love, my stars, my heart.

801
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:16,258
I sound like a fool.

802
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,089
You cannot know...

803
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:20,900
Do you know how much I've missed you?

804
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,890
What took you so long?

805
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,640
Lance, I've been trying.

806
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,189
- You left me.
- No.

807
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,399
You abandoned me.

808
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,278
No, I needed to stop my brother.

809
00:36:36,279 --> 00:36:39,160
And now I'm dead, and you can never die.

810
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:44,920
It's cold here. I'm so alone.

811
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,699
I've almost given up so many times.

812
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,069
No, no, just... don't.

813
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:54,179
I will not break my
promise to you, okay?

814
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,909
I finally know what to do.

815
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:58,049
We'll be together soon, so soon.

816
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,926
- How?
- Just wait by the door.

817
00:36:59,927 --> 00:37:02,887
I've tried. I can't pass through it.

818
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:05,119
No, I know, but you
will be able to soon.

819
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,399
That's why I reached out to you,

820
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,889
to tell you to wait by the door.

821
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:10,437
Okay, okay.

822
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,849
Rupert...

823
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:17,944
Listen to me. Wait by the door.

824
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,030
Eliot.

825
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,990
What the fuck did you do?

826
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,662
And you actually think this
page might contain the answer?

827
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:30,219
Tell us what you need.

828
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,949
Our resources are at your disposal.

829
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,501
I just need to go and get it.

830
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:34,509
We'll send someone.

831
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:36,796
I'd rather get it myself.

832
00:37:36,797 --> 00:37:38,749
A few librarians, security...

833
00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:40,467
seems prudent to send one person.

834
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,659
You almost had me.

835
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:47,223
Just peanut butter and
turkey sandwiches.

836
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:48,929
I'm afraid I'm not following.

837
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:51,629
We're in the Library,
where there's glitches

838
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,604
'cause of hedges, right?

839
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:55,319
So why do these glitches keep happening

840
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,559
during lunar intervals?

841
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,692
Why are the Neitherlands
affected by the Earth's moon?

842
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,987
Makes no sense. Where am I really?

843
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,299
Earth, which you manage to figure out

844
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,020
every motherfucking time.

845
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,259
What is this? Some sort of illusion?

846
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,540
Psychic spell.

847
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:17,279
Basically you're in the Matrix,

848
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,670
which means we're still
on Earth, hence glitches.

849
00:38:20,674 --> 00:38:22,799
How many times have I done this?

850
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,926
18.

851
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,399
Been sending you back to the beginning.

852
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,719
It's getting tiresome.

853
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,259
Wait, the... the books,

854
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,379
fixing the moon, it was all just...

855
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,639
Bullshit.

856
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,312
Starting with you getting
Kady to text me.

857
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,809
- Who are you?
- Come on.

858
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:38,209
I'm insulted.

859
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:40,439
You've been asking about me.

860
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,319
The Couple.

861
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,789
Less impressive the 18th
time you figure it out.

862
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,239
Look, you're sick of this.

863
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,470
I'm really sick of this.

864
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,410
Why don't we have this convo
in the real world, huh?

865
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,329
Not doing this 19 times.

866
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:01,380
Give me the page, or I kill Kady.

867
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:13,809
How do I know that's really Kady?

868
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,395
How do I know this is even real?

869
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,772
Only one way to know,

870
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,170
and that's to feel it.

871
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:25,149
What are you doing?

872
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:28,809
Phosphoromancer, right?

873
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:30,075
Please don't do this.

874
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,940
- I know you use this finger a lot.
- Please, please. No!

875
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:41,319
Promise... give me the page.

876
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,719
If the finger's still
viable, I reattach.

877
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:54,809
Middle finger, also very important.

878
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:59,260
Love spells need a ring finger.

879
00:39:59,270 --> 00:40:01,099
Oh...

880
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,639
Pinkies are crucial.

881
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:14,996
Well? Alice?

882
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,374
Okay.

883
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:20,359
Okay.

884
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,044
You want my thumb too?

885
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:27,399
Disappointed that this isn't working,

886
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,019
because the next cut isn't your thumb.

887
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,679
It's Kady.

888
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,219
The page, or kill Kady.

889
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,079
What's it gonna be?

890
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:42,941
Okay, okay, you win. It's yours. It's...

891
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:44,441
it's fucking yours.

892
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,389
Oh, good.

893
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,919
Relieved.

894
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,059
Now, where do I go?

895
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:53,819
Oh, hold that thought.

896
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,989
I forgot my pen.

897
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:00,290
Okay.

898
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:09,919
Is he all right?

899
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,469
What do you care?

900
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:14,888
It was never my intention to hurt him.

901
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:17,392
You think that matters?

902
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:22,105
I lost someone too.

903
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,399
And I loved him so much.

904
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,760
I know the pain.

905
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,069
It's not an excuse to hurt people

906
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,824
just because you want him back.

907
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:39,705
Maybe you didn't love him
as much as you think,

908
00:41:39,706 --> 00:41:42,542
because you don't understand.

909
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:45,369
I have work to do.

910
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,239
You see what you're up against.

911
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,319
Fillory can never be free

912
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,049
so long as the Dark King reigns.

913
00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:00,189
One thing I'm confused about.

914
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:02,061
Where do you fit in to all of this?

915
00:42:02,062 --> 00:42:05,439
Well, Rupert recognized me.

916
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,399
Oh, he's always disliked me.

917
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,799
He's the one who cursed me
with the Tongue Twisters.

918
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,169
No, I shall find no happiness in Fillory

919
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:14,406
so long as he's around.

920
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:16,839
So after you leave here, what?

921
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,379
Just gonna hit the streets?

922
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:20,245
Oh, hardly.

923
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:22,664
I shall write.

924
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:28,249
The things I have seen,
the stories I can tell.

925
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:30,719
His stories are very good.

926
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,459
Just not exactly kid-appropriate.

927
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:37,589
Oh, oh, oh, vexing.

928
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:40,870
Oh, flattery flophouse.

929
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:44,419
Did you really have to do that?

930
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,146
He seemed like such a nice...

931
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:47,149
Pedophile?

932
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,299
He's grooming you, Fen,

933
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,719
because you act like you're 12.

934
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,479
Oh, Gods.

935
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,409
Remember, make sure to lock
on the right vibration.

936
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:00,702
Can you feel it?

937
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,330
Mm, it feels like home.

938
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:07,940
Here we go.

939
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,499
Hi.

940
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:18,139
I think... I think... I think we did it.

941
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,079
Should I let go of your ha...

942
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:26,349
This... did you...

943
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:29,849
No, not on purpose.

944
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:32,889
I do... I'm not sure
I even did this at all.

945
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:34,111
Whoa, why do I feel like I've...

946
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:35,899
Been here before.

947
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,199
Because this is it.

948
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,989
This is where the signal brought us.

949
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:44,089
Okay, okay, I'll just travel us out.

950
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:45,499
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

951
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,439
- Plum.
- It's not working.

952
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,720
We can't leave.
