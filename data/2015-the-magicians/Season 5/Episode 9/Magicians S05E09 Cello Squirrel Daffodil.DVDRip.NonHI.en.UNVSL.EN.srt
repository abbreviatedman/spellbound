1
00:00:01,101 --> 00:00:02,729
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,305
Christopher Plover. The
children's book author?

3
00:00:05,372 --> 00:00:06,567
You're familiar with my work.

4
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:08,198
I've read Martin Chatwin's book.

5
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:10,971
<i>You're the pervert who
turned him into The Beast.</i>

6
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:13,878
The age-suspension
spells Martin used,

7
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:15,643
it must still be
keeping me alive.

8
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:19,209
I don't know what this signal is,
but I know why it's targeting me.

9
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:20,363
And I'm gonna figure out...

10
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:21,685
Whoa! Hang on.

11
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:23,132
Merritt, you don't know
what that's gonna do.

12
00:00:23,156 --> 00:00:24,156
You're right.

13
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:25,992
What...

14
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:28,221
Ever since I found this
page, I knew it was important.

15
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:30,388
<i>It's an instruction
manual.</i> ALICE: <i>For what?</i>

16
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:32,830
The World Seed. It can
grow into almost anything.

17
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,459
Even an entire world.

18
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:37,403
The Couple has been looking for
the World Seed page a long time,

19
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:38,836
and they are not good people.

20
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:40,841
And they know I
have what they want.

21
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:42,171
Pregnant.

22
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:43,609
Shit.

23
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,989
Really appreciate it if we could
keep this between you and I.

24
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:47,013
Of course.

25
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:51,083
Let's go find our
books, shall we?

26
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:53,346
You better be
able to speed read.

27
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:55,488
No!

28
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,535
<i>Okay, so what if we locate
the tree from Seb's tattoo</i>

29
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,439
and chop it down? Would
that sever this conduit?

30
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:02,496
In theory, yes.

31
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:05,226
He would be mortal,
and 100% stab-able.

32
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,810
Jesus, cock and balls.
What's keeping Julia and El?

33
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,590
We just murdered the goddamn
king back there. They should act like it.

34
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:22,583
Ooh, sorry. Probably
just Julia's toe worms.

35
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,948
Hey, we should stop
so she can catch up.

36
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:27,453
You've got toe worms, and
you're moving at a normal speed.

37
00:01:27,554 --> 00:01:30,581
Oh, I'm just used to... Hey,
what happened to your eye?

38
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:32,057
I lent it to Josh.

39
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:34,960
What happened to his eye?

40
00:01:35,062 --> 00:01:36,462
Nothing. He's an idiot.

41
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:39,556
He went back to warn Tick and Rafe
to get out before things go shit-shaped.

42
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:41,693
Okay. Wait, and
so why did you...

43
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:45,967
I'm worried, so I'm keeping
an eye on him, okay? Christ.

44
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:48,542
Oh, it's a pun. I get it.
Because you gave him your eye.

45
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,703
Shut the fuck up, Fen.

46
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,770
Okay.

47
00:01:56,249 --> 00:01:58,241
Julia, you have to
hurry. You okay?

48
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:00,651
Yeah, I'm just, um,
a little out of shape.

49
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:02,565
Okay, don't mean to push,
but since we don't know

50
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,558
how the Centurions
will react to Seb's body,

51
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,821
and you were intimately
involved in making him dead,

52
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:08,657
we should probably
move more quickly.

53
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:10,863
Uh, Eliot? ELIOT: Uh...

54
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,027
I wouldn't if I were you.

55
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:20,106
Seb.

56
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:21,574
Surprised?

57
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:24,443
Take them.

58
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,145
Uh...

59
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:44,661
Shit.

60
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,202
Sorry about that, Quentin.

61
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,840
Lame-ass Welters nerd.

62
00:02:57,678 --> 00:02:58,678
Merritt?

63
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:00,838
What? What happened?

64
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:04,309
You tell me. You said
you were a Chatwin,

65
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:06,910
you ripped off your patch,
and then you disappeared.

66
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,518
Where's Julia?
And Lipson, and...

67
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:13,853
You've been gone three weeks.

68
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:15,795
What?

69
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:19,066
It was just a room.

70
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:22,367
No windows. No doors.

71
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,260
No one else there.

72
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:26,196
That's all I remember.

73
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:28,384
You remember more than I
did when the signal grabbed me.

74
00:03:28,408 --> 00:03:31,242
But I was there seconds,
at least I thought.

75
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:33,336
And who knows
how this shit works.

76
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:34,540
It's a weird one.

77
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:36,549
What do your rocks say?

78
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:42,481
That young Merritt isn't under any
memory curses so far as I can see.

79
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:45,248
My name is actually
Plum, remember?

80
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,257
I just have to own it.

81
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,124
Leave the ranks of Chatwins

82
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,061
who go by middle
names or nicknames

83
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:52,963
or, you know,
supervillain monikers.

84
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,525
Hi. Plum fucking
Chatwin, cursed freak.

85
00:03:56,703 --> 00:04:00,196
Well, on the plus, you
don't have a brain injury,

86
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,431
you aren't psychotic.

87
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:05,569
And, uh, except for the disorientation
and a bit of combination skin,

88
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,878
you're perfectly healthy.

89
00:04:09,216 --> 00:04:12,983
Whoa, whoa. So
what, you're done?

90
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,086
Well, first...

91
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:15,398
I'm gonna grab
a bottle of tequila,

92
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:18,688
so that I can really enjoy my
post-coma limited work hours.

93
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,752
But, uh, after that,
yeah, I'm done.

94
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:27,465
Look, this weird room, that's
more than we've had to go on.

95
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:30,765
It's also nothing
to go on at all.

96
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,639
The way traveling works,

97
00:04:35,242 --> 00:04:37,268
you imagine a place,

98
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:38,544
you see it in your mind's eye,

99
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:41,582
and then just go. What?

100
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,475
You do know this is the
most you've actually talked

101
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:46,519
about traveling since
you took up here?

102
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,250
Look, my point is, you
don't have to point on a map,

103
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:51,655
just picture it.

104
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:54,059
You want me to go back.

105
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,063
Not really, because it's dangerous.
But just pointing out that...

106
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,725
That it's the only thing we
have, is what you're pointing out.

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,059
When I was a first year,

108
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:04,332
I had this stupid idea that
teachers knew a ton more than me.

109
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:05,598
They're above you.

110
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,071
Pretty much no one
knows dick about anything.

111
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:09,973
Especially Traveler shit.

112
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,806
What the signal is? Why?

113
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:13,289
No one's waiting
around to solve it.

114
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:17,614
But I've never traveled by
myself. And I don't know how.

115
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,518
And even, assuming you're
not completely a shit teacher,

116
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,918
I can't go back there.

117
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,684
And not alone. You won't be.

118
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:30,827
Oh, you stupid twat, that hurts.

119
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:34,332
Kind of late to ask for the
anesthesia spell. Mmm.

120
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:37,369
Done.

121
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:40,501
Now you can take people
with you when you travel.

122
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:42,566
Which is why it is
important that you...

123
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,942
Yes, I read the chapters you
gave me. I get the principles.

124
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,345
We start with baby steps.

125
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,785
All you gotta do is travel
us both across the lab.

126
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:54,651
Now, I'm gonna draw
a circle. Just aim for it.

127
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,590
And don't worry.

128
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:00,126
If you get lost,
I'll be right there.

129
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:01,327
Professor Adiyodi.

130
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:02,487
It's Penny.

131
00:06:02,562 --> 00:06:03,860
Bringing you my troubles

132
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:05,660
has cocked things
up enough already. I...

133
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,564
I don't want to
make things worse.

134
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:11,536
Yeah, well, messing up my life kind
of runs in your family. I'm used to it.

135
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:13,267
You're not convincing me.

136
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,203
Which Chatwin
are you related to?

137
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:21,705
Honestly, I don't know.
My parents are British,

138
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:24,614
they have the proper sense
not to speak of the family curse.

139
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,720
Well, you are the
third Chatwin I've met.

140
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:31,153
First one was a beast who
basically tortured me when I was a kid.

141
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,920
But his sister, Jane,

142
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,386
she did everything
she could to stop him.

143
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:37,761
She changed time.

144
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:39,859
She was incredible.

145
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,530
So, family curse,

146
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,103
as far as I'm concerned,
the scales are even.

147
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,635
You could tip it either way.

148
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:50,843
Remember,

149
00:06:52,178 --> 00:06:53,178
aim for the circle.

150
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,082
Here goes nothing.

151
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:04,047
I did it! I actually did it.

152
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:06,324
I honestly thought I was
just gonna, like, kill us both.

153
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,951
Like, straight-up
50-50 chance we...

154
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,290
Plum?

155
00:07:09,396 --> 00:07:10,396
Yeah?

156
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:12,828
Where's the chalk circle? It...

157
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,896
It... Huh? Uh...

158
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:19,371
Uh...

159
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:22,233
Hey. Where's everybody going?

160
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,934
Dean Shiring got dial-up
in the computer closet.

161
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:26,885
We're going to use it
to read the Starr Report.

162
00:07:26,913 --> 00:07:28,939
Or at least the blow job parts.

163
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:30,049
Dial-up?

164
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:31,436
The Starr Report?
That came out...

165
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,743
Oh.

166
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,585
I traveled us to 1998.

167
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:41,091
Yeah, well, I have a strong guess
which Chatwin you're related to.

168
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:44,421
The Couple? Never heard of them.

169
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:47,763
I hadn't either until they sent
a shiitake monster after me.

170
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:49,779
I'd like to know who they are

171
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,533
before they come
looking for me again.

172
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:54,297
Well, I know a guy.

173
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:57,442
He owes me, like,
three favors, so, let's see.

174
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,070
Thanks, Kady.

175
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:03,273
Now you owe me
three favors. Hmm.

176
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:07,853
He wants to meet.

177
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13,819
You are never
gonna believe where.

178
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:17,521
The hell happened here?

179
00:08:18,865 --> 00:08:20,197
We've been redecorating.

180
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,963
Alice and Kady, I'm so
very glad you've come.

181
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,732
Zelda? What are you doing here?

182
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,535
Rebuilding. Come
to see George, yes?

183
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,806
Didn't know you knew him.

184
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,367
Hmm. He's right over there.

185
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:33,369
Oh.

186
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,880
Hey.

187
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:38,816
How did all this happen? Are those
Hedges working with Librarians?

188
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:41,317
Honestly? It was you.

189
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:43,357
After you helped me
burn all those books,

190
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:46,449
I realized the Library needed
to be rebuilt from the ground up.

191
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,104
How did you convince
them to help you?

192
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:50,893
I'd been helping Kady and
Harriet remove Reed's Marks.

193
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,296
A sort of penance,
if we're being honest.

194
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,858
But suddenly I found myself
surrounded by grateful Magicians

195
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,699
just looking for
something to do.

196
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:00,196
What was that?

197
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:04,069
Our new recruits are enthusiastic,
but their education is spotty.

198
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:06,737
This branch is kept functioning
by very specific spells.

199
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,906
But proper casting,
especially here,

200
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:12,349
in the Circumstances of the
Neitherlands, sometimes eludes them.

201
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:15,680
Alice? This is George.

202
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,952
So, you're the one
the Couple's after?

203
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:19,358
Do you know them?

204
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:21,622
No. But I know a guy who might.

205
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,094
I need a day to track him down.

206
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:28,062
Thanks, George.
Two favors to go.

207
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:33,729
As long as you're waiting, perhaps
you could help us with a problem?

208
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36,504
I've pulled some volumes from
the Poison Room. Highly dangerous.

209
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,371
You're some of the few I
trust to look through them.

210
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,874
And what are you looking for?

211
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:43,444
A way to fix magic.

212
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:48,417
Unless you have something
more important to do?

213
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:55,956
Thank God I got
past the Centurion.

214
00:09:56,062 --> 00:10:00,056
How the hell is the Dark King still
alive? We cut down his tree. Stabbed him.

215
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:01,465
This doesn't seem possible.

216
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:04,248
El said he's a healer. Maybe he
cast something with his last breath.

217
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:06,933
I don't know. But our
friends are back there.

218
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:13,277
I can see Josh hiding out, so he's
safe for now. But Julia and Eliot?

219
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,375
Did they get back
here before us?

220
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:26,550
Hey. Who the fuck are you?

221
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:31,990
Cello. Squirrel. Daffodil.

222
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:33,332
Okay.

223
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,192
Uh, Margo, what are you doing?

224
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,395
Life lesson, Fen.
There's always a point

225
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,099
where you can decide,
"That's not my problem."

226
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,007
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

227
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:45,511
We have friends to
save, a Dark King to re-kill.

228
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,648
Hang with Mad Libs
pedophile all you want,

229
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,580
I'm going back to
double-tap the motherfucker

230
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,778
like he's Osama and
I'm SEAL Team Bitch.

231
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:56,345
No, no. Excelsior in springtime.
Excelsior in springtime.

232
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:57,583
Whatever you say.

233
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,217
Wait. I think he's trying
to tell us something.

234
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,295
Exactly. About Fillory?

235
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:03,887
And the Dark King?

236
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:06,332
Charcuterie.

237
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:15,837
Either he had a stroke, or some
whimsical Fillorian shit happened to him.

238
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:19,311
Secrets and blueberries.
Spongy walrus hat.

239
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,971
On the edge of the Burnt River,

240
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:24,040
there's an insect called
the Tongue Twister

241
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:27,552
that supposedly crawls into your
skull and confuses your words.

242
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:28,917
Is that like a stroke?

243
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,547
Ah. Fingernail clippings.

244
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:34,053
Hold up. Somebody's near Josh.

245
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,089
Son of a... Shit, it's the
Dark King. He's coming.

246
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,564
Wait, no. God damn it.

247
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:40,666
What happened?

248
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,532
Josh put my eye in his
pocket, so I can't see shit.

249
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:49,465
If he's got something to say about
the Dark King, we need to know it.

250
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:52,373
How? If he's got Tongue
Twisters in his brain hole?

251
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,569
I know a guy.

252
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:57,247
He's an idiot, but he
might be able to help.

253
00:12:01,854 --> 00:12:03,686
Professor Fogg?

254
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:06,352
Hi.

255
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,054
Ski masks.

256
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:11,255
Big trend in the future?

257
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:12,855
Trying to avoid a time paradox.

258
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:17,927
Ah. Smart. And stupid. You don't
think I'll recognize your voices?

259
00:12:18,037 --> 00:12:19,757
Kind of counted on
you being a little drunk.

260
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:21,073
Hmm.

261
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:22,534
It's the afternoon.

262
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,203
Next time, try Pinter's
facial distortion.

263
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:26,974
Literally made for
this sort of thing.

264
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,948
Unless you, you
know, prefer this look.

265
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:33,542
Yeah, look, um, what do you
know about Time Travelers?

266
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:35,887
They're a myth.

267
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,887
And yet here we are.

268
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:43,292
Well, it seems like you
have a gift, Miss Ski Mask.

269
00:12:43,396 --> 00:12:45,160
But poor aim.

270
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:46,927
Can you help?

271
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:49,134
Maybe.

272
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:55,567
This time bridge is set
for a fixed moment in time.

273
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:59,409
But we can remove
the temporal compass,

274
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:03,974
and adjust it to help you
navigate back to, uh, 2020.

275
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:06,112
Can you feel the
vibration? Yeah.

276
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:08,086
Good, it's pointing
towards home.

277
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:09,486
Thanks, Professor Fogg.

278
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:11,319
No, gosh, thank you. Thank you.

279
00:13:11,424 --> 00:13:13,586
This might all make an
excellent dissertation.

280
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,622
Might even be worth a promotion.

281
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:17,822
Oh, God, no. Me, Dean?

282
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:21,367
No. I'd have to pay off a
lot of colleagues' wives.

283
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:24,770
Good luck.

284
00:13:33,946 --> 00:13:36,814
Did it work? Are we back?

285
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:38,107
I don't know.

286
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:52,093
Excuse me. Be a pal and sweep
up the men's dining room? Thanks.

287
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:55,967
Nope.

288
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,235
How is Seb still alive?

289
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:00,706
I have no idea.

290
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,466
I mean, you saw me run
him through with a sword.

291
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:07,776
Which is not something I expected
to do to anyone, kind of ever.

292
00:14:11,951 --> 00:14:12,975
You okay?

293
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:16,819
Yeah. Um, I just have a
problem, and it's getting worse.

294
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:24,863
How did you get so pregnant?

295
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:28,999
The usual way, except
it's Red Monkey Month

296
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:30,730
so everything
grows a lot faster.

297
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:36,140
I guess, congratulations?

298
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:41,437
Oh. Thanks, I think.

299
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,441
Present deal aside, the
whole "circle of life" of this,

300
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,883
is kind of very moving.

301
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:49,012
In a far less
dungeon-y time line,

302
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:52,820
I'd definitely be asking you to throw
me a baby shower right about now.

303
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:56,351
I know a spell that makes
sparkling cider get you hammered.

304
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:58,728
Perfect loophole
for this situation.

305
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,891
Glad to see you're
keeping your spirits up.

306
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,101
I wouldn't want it
gloomy down here.

307
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,399
And now I've killed
the conversation.

308
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,838
Are you going to execute us?

309
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,038
I can't.

310
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,409
I need your help.

311
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,919
Basic problem's the same.

312
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:22,582
We can't fix magic on Earth.

313
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:26,287
We did some stuff to the moon,
and she's mad, and she's a...

314
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,088
A monumental cunt?

315
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:31,653
Evidently. So she's
screwing up Circumstances.

316
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:38,368
My Akkadian's rusty,
but I... I think this says that

317
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,966
we can win the
moon's favor if we...

318
00:15:42,074 --> 00:15:43,474
Virgin sacrifice.

319
00:15:43,843 --> 00:15:45,971
Okay. Well, that's out.

320
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:49,071
Not to mention the method
of death is pretty gross.

321
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:51,416
Ew.

322
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:52,484
That bad, huh?

323
00:15:52,585 --> 00:15:54,645
No it's just the
lights flickered,

324
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:58,384
and now there's peanut
butter in my turkey sandwich.

325
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:02,485
I thought wonky casting
was an Earth-specific problem.

326
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:04,928
I think this issue's more basic.

327
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:07,293
All the new people
learning Library operations.

328
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,232
Including culinary charms.

329
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:13,063
At least Zelda can reassign
Hedges that cast for shit.

330
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,267
The moon, however,
has job security.

331
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:18,106
You're fired, Moon.

332
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,075
Wait, what if we could?

333
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:23,543
Fire the moon, I mean.

334
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,149
Kind of remember hearing Earth
would end in fiery apocalypse.

335
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:30,781
No, I'm saying, what if we got
rid of it and made a new one?

336
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,355
That's batshit.

337
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,956
This book is on earthworks
magic in the South Pacific.

338
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:40,860
You know, how to create
an island out of nothing.

339
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,866
Yeah, that's not
exactly the same.

340
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,267
These books are
from the Poison Room.

341
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:46,431
Not for amateurs.

342
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,805
If there's a way to make a
new moon, it'll be in here.

343
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:57,473
Say "ah..."

344
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,848
Fire engine.

345
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:02,721
Well there's your
problem. He can't talk right.

346
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:04,484
No shit, Gordy. We
wanna know why.

347
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:06,685
Check his ears.
Anything in there?

348
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,859
Hmm.

349
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:09,919
Just your usual ear stuff.

350
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,899
Hold up. What is that?

351
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:19,397
Give me a minute, it's
deep in there. And blammo!

352
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:23,908
Yep, it's a Tongue Twister.

353
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:25,906
How ya feeling now?

354
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:27,412
Linoleum.

355
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,072
Shit. It wasn't the bug.

356
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,707
Well, maybe not this one.

357
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,844
There's a bunch in there.

358
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:35,917
Hundreds.

359
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:42,151
Thousands. All down
his... Mmm... Spinal bones?

360
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:45,091
I can get 'em out.
If I can keep one.

361
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:47,257
I'm sure I'll regret
asking. Why?

362
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:48,366
For the respect.

363
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:51,236
So I can write a...

364
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:52,430
A...

365
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:53,572
Paper?

366
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,074
Right, one of those.
It'd be huge for me.

367
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:58,801
I'll never get laughed
out of VetCon again.

368
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,243
How long is it gonna take?

369
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:04,079
Don't know. Looks
like each critter

370
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:07,711
has an energy-meridian
tether, as well as a physical one.

371
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:11,724
It's like he's possessed by
a thousand little spirits. So...

372
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:13,986
This is a possession problem?

373
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:18,087
No, it's a bug problem. And
those bugs are possessing him.

374
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,366
Don't worry, I deal
with cats all day.

375
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,270
They are possessed
like you wouldn't believe.

376
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:28,568
Rhubarb.

377
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:37,275
That should do it.

378
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,276
He's bleeding
out! Call a doctor!

379
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:43,553
Oh. Yeah.

380
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:50,726
1920.

381
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:53,789
Maybe Fogg flipped
a digit, setting it.

382
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:57,327
If we can figure out what he
got wrong, we can fix his mistake.

383
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,462
I just wish we had
some instructions.

384
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:01,665
Excuse me?

385
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:05,339
This area is for
students and faculty only.

386
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:07,208
I am faculty. I am a student.

387
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:10,181
And I am the King of Siam. Out.

388
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:11,841
Look, dude. I don't know what...

389
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:14,182
Hey, getting in a fight is
only gonna make this harder.

390
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:17,213
Thank you.

391
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:29,193
If we can't get in the Library

392
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,361
then we are stuck here
reenacting <i>The Help</i>

393
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,439
with these casually
racist white people.

394
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:37,037
We don't know anyone
here who can help us.

395
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:39,703
I swear, Helen, I could
sense something...

396
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:45,979
Someone watching me in the
bath, like... Like a pervert ghost.

397
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:50,857
Maybe we do know
someone who can help.

398
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:55,390
"Of one not easily
jealous, but being wrought.

399
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,986
"Perplexed in the extreme.

400
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:02,529
"Of one whose hand.
Like the base Indian,

401
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:05,366
"threw a pearl away,
richer than all his tribe."

402
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:06,515
You're telling me

403
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:11,477
this guy whacks off to people
he watches from the astral plane?

404
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:13,545
Yeah.

405
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:15,581
The melting mood...

406
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:17,909
Do we really need his help?

407
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:21,951
Look, in a hundred years he's
gonna be a really nice guy, so...

408
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:25,815
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

409
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,416
It just... It...

410
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:30,690
It won't feel like <i>Othello</i>
until I'm in blackface.

411
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:34,593
Okay, so, uh, he's
got a ways to go.

412
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,965
Hyman, hey.

413
00:20:38,137 --> 00:20:41,403
Do I know you? Uh,
yeah, I'm Penbrooke...

414
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:43,969
And this is Prune.

415
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:48,446
Ah. And you are
visiting mystics?

416
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:51,778
Right, from India and...

417
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:53,853
And the... The Dark Continent?

418
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,945
Okay. God give me strength.

419
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:57,956
Yo, listen, we
needed some help...

420
00:20:58,057 --> 00:20:59,267
I'm sorry, I'm late
to Phrenology.

421
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:00,589
Okay, buddy.

422
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:03,595
Listen up, dude,

423
00:21:03,696 --> 00:21:06,291
we know you're the
pervert ghost of Brakebills.

424
00:21:06,398 --> 00:21:09,800
So either you help us,
or everybody knows.

425
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,264
I've looked through
everything Seb gave us,

426
00:21:15,341 --> 00:21:18,505
and seems like some
sort of communication spell.

427
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:21,109
It's going to take
the three of us.

428
00:21:22,248 --> 00:21:26,709
I have no clue
what it does, though.

429
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:31,716
El? Help, here?

430
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:33,652
What's the point?

431
00:21:34,193 --> 00:21:37,163
Once we're done, what reason
does he have to keep us alive?

432
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:41,266
I don't think
he'll kill us. You.

433
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:45,469
I saw the way he talked to you.

434
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:47,598
Nobody is that hurt
if they don't care.

435
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,838
I attract the best
guys, don't I?

436
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,307
You attract basically everyone.

437
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,643
And with that
broad of an appeal,

438
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,686
you're bound to magnetize a
couple of questionable monarchs.

439
00:22:02,555 --> 00:22:04,751
We will figure
something out, I promise.

440
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:05,824
Okay.

441
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,526
Help. Okay.

442
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:17,569
This sigil, it looks sort of like
part of a messenger charm

443
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:21,198
that you would use to send a
letter across a lake or a river...

444
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:24,300
Oh, shit. Yeah.
Um, I recognize it.

445
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:28,336
Um, it was in a book I was
reading right after Q died.

446
00:22:28,414 --> 00:22:30,474
I was... I was
doing a lot of, uh...

447
00:22:30,983 --> 00:22:32,246
Grief-googling?

448
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,685
He wants to do a seance.

449
00:22:35,888 --> 00:22:37,208
But I thought
those were bullshit.

450
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:38,523
Not always.

451
00:22:39,225 --> 00:22:41,956
It's dark magic. And
it can go very wrong.

452
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,326
I never could figure it
out, but maybe he did.

453
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:48,231
But why cooperative? Three
people means a lot of power.

454
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,201
Well, he must be trying to contact
someone who's been dead a very long time.

455
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:54,239
Oh, shit.

456
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,703
I think I know who.

457
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,448
Hello, Professor Frank.

458
00:23:06,285 --> 00:23:09,346
Those two can't be in
here during regular hours.

459
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:10,753
Uh, but they're with me.

460
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:13,849
I'm doing a report on
magic of the West Indies.

461
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:16,589
They are translating for me.

462
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:17,862
Huh.

463
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,769
Nothing... There's nothing
here. It is all theoretical.

464
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,305
There's not even an entry
for a temporal compass.

465
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:30,407
As far as I can tell, time bridges
haven't even been invented yet.

466
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:32,543
Uh...

467
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:36,038
Time bridges? Like
Professor Sato's work?

468
00:23:39,318 --> 00:23:40,377
Is that...

469
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:43,217
Hey. Yeah?

470
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:46,724
This looks exactly
like the time bridge

471
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,420
that we pulled the
compass out of.

472
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:50,128
He's building it.

473
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:51,390
Today.

474
00:23:52,498 --> 00:23:54,228
That can't be a coincidence.

475
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,231
But still, it doesn't
make any sense.

476
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:59,739
I mean, why take us here
to today? And why 1998?

477
00:24:00,406 --> 00:24:05,208
Wait, wait, wait. You traveled
to the Year of Our Lord 1998?

478
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:11,584
Horsefeathers. What, was the
world overrun with metal automatons

479
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:13,243
taking over all the work of men?

480
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:14,519
Yes.

481
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:16,246
Look.

482
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,253
"September, 1998."

483
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:20,657
I was holding it when
we traveled to 1998.

484
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:23,456
And then, I was
holding the compass

485
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:26,158
that was made today
when we landed here today.

486
00:24:26,699 --> 00:24:27,699
Oh.

487
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:29,260
They're totems.

488
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:33,936
Remedial Traveler students
sometimes have trouble

489
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:35,440
picturing their destination,

490
00:24:35,507 --> 00:24:38,602
so holding an object from
that place can sometimes help.

491
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:42,475
Okay, so that, but
time instead of space?

492
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:44,513
So I guess in
order to get home...

493
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:45,982
We need something from our time.

494
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,711
"From our time." I
was gonna say it.

495
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:56,427
Hey, you know this language?

496
00:24:58,497 --> 00:24:59,497
Um...

497
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:03,331
The front half looks
like Old Church Slavonic.

498
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:04,813
The back half, I
don't recognize it.

499
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,669
No, no, no. The
Slavonic part I could read.

500
00:25:06,739 --> 00:25:10,267
It's something about a seed
that could grow into anything.

501
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:13,904
What if it could
grow into a moon?

502
00:25:22,154 --> 00:25:23,154
I don't believe it.

503
00:25:23,222 --> 00:25:24,222
What?

504
00:25:26,925 --> 00:25:31,863
That this book is missing a page.
Something called the World Seed.

505
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,008
How do you know what it's about

506
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,193
if the page is missing?

507
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:39,596
Because it's what the Couple's
after. The page. And I have it.

508
00:25:40,406 --> 00:25:41,406
What?

509
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:44,477
Meanwhile, we're trying
to solve a different problem.

510
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,567
But then...

511
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:48,203
But there's this book that
happens to be the same book

512
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:50,077
that the World Seed
page came from?

513
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:52,408
Coincidence,
synchronicity, or...

514
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:54,686
I always assume trap.

515
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:57,013
How much do you
trust the Hedges?

516
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:59,149
About as much as
you trust the Library.

517
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:00,324
Hmm.

518
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,591
There's no way this isn't a con.

519
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:07,366
We're looking for an answer
that requires unusual power.

520
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,432
Something unusually powerful.

521
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:11,970
Logically, it's gonna be rare,

522
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,596
lot of people wanting it. Right?

523
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:17,403
So, not weird, right?

524
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:19,803
Just saying.

525
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:23,405
True. I mean, it can't
be this easy. Can it?

526
00:26:24,183 --> 00:26:26,618
Maybe everything's been
really hard for a long time,

527
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:28,914
and we caught a single
fucking break for once.

528
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:36,184
Oh, hey, a Smoothie
Castle card from 2009.

529
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:40,559
So we don't have
anything from 2020?

530
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:43,727
Great, so we're just stuck in
this backwards-ass place here.

531
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:45,736
Did you do this?

532
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,438
Do what?

533
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:50,134
Brakebills has
given me the icy mitt.

534
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:51,800
I've been streeted.

535
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:53,904
Oh, my God. Expelled.

536
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:56,241
Someone ratted
me out to the faculty.

537
00:26:56,315 --> 00:26:57,315
Well, it wasn't us.

538
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,578
Someone must've
overheard our conversation.

539
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:04,651
Well, eavesdropping on a private
moment? Who would do that?

540
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:09,922
You. Constantly. Which is
why you're getting expelled.

541
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:14,795
Did you give her permission
to use irony in this way?

542
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:19,003
Good riddance
to the both of you.

543
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,097
This is bad.

544
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:24,633
He was supposed to
stay, get caught projecting,

545
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:26,735
and then be trapped when
someone hides his body.

546
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:30,213
Okay, so then expulsion
actually saves him

547
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:33,285
from being trapped in
astral purgatory for a century,

548
00:27:33,352 --> 00:27:37,050
and saves generations of
Brakebills women from being spied on.

549
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:38,156
You don't get it.

550
00:27:38,457 --> 00:27:40,756
If Hyman doesn't get trapped,
he can't help future me.

551
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:43,793
And future me can't
save magic, and we lose it.

552
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:45,823
Forever.

553
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,963
We need to fix this.

554
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:54,230
But how? By trapping
him ourselves?

555
00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:55,907
Exactly.

556
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:58,809
Wait!

557
00:28:07,386 --> 00:28:10,845
On the bright side, this is my
chance to finally go to Europe.

558
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:16,517
I hear Weimar Berlin's got
some swell erotic attractions.

559
00:28:17,663 --> 00:28:18,663
I bet.

560
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:25,929
God! What am I doing?

561
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:28,507
I came to Brakebills
to learn, you know,

562
00:28:28,574 --> 00:28:31,066
and the lesson of my
expulsion is clear as a creek.

563
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:34,838
Maybe, and I know this is crazy,

564
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:39,910
but maybe it is wrong to
spy on people in the shower.

565
00:28:40,586 --> 00:28:41,586
Well...

566
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:44,689
I know. "Then why
did God give you

567
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:47,419
"the ability to spy on
people in the shower?"

568
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:51,739
Look, I can't tell you
how to live your life.

569
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:52,763
But, um...

570
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,366
Look, being a Traveler
can feel like a burden, yes.

571
00:28:57,436 --> 00:29:00,270
But not being a Traveler?

572
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,975
Not being able to use
your gift, it's worse.

573
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:05,543
Believe me.

574
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:10,876
There's no harm
in looking, right?

575
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:13,384
You know?

576
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:17,915
You're a good egg,
Penbrooke. Yeah.

577
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19,049
Okay.

578
00:29:20,225 --> 00:29:23,457
Uh... Hey, before I forget,

579
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:27,021
any idea how I can score some
tickets to the Women's Welters match?

580
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:28,765
It's in an hour.

581
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:35,069
Women's Welters has a match
tonight? It's not on the schedule.

582
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:36,335
Oh, it's a surprise match.

583
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:41,937
Yeah, uh, they're probably
in the locker room right now.

584
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:45,075
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Uh-huh. I see.

585
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:51,715
I am going to need to finish
packing by myself, in private, okay?

586
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,588
Yeah, okay. Um, cool. Great.

587
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:54,659
Uh...

588
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,119
Yeah, bye.

589
00:30:01,066 --> 00:30:02,110
Okay, it worked. We
only have a few minutes.

590
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,134
Okay. Um...

591
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,101
Hear me out on something.

592
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,297
Yes, it's bad.

593
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:08,465
Magic's at stake. Do I have
to do the speech again?

594
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,510
I stole this from
Professor Sato's things.

595
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:13,738
Stasis charm. Freezes
the wearer in time.

596
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:17,544
Plum, the body isn't supposed to
be preserved, it's supposed to die.

597
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,380
Who says? No one
ever found his body.

598
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,363
Maybe we were the ones
who hid it in the first place.

599
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:23,912
Not how time works.

600
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,013
How do you know?

601
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:28,685
What matters is he'd still be
trapped, and still be on the astral plane.

602
00:30:28,794 --> 00:30:31,354
Unless it's a shitty hiding
spot and Hyman finds it.

603
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:35,025
Unless he doesn't, and 100
years from now we can fix him.

604
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:37,364
What's the point of
having this stupid ability

605
00:30:37,469 --> 00:30:39,131
if I can't change anything?

606
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:40,399
Who says there's a point?

607
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:41,835
You are born with this shit,

608
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:44,218
and you spend the rest of
your life trying to survive it.

609
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:45,972
Okay? Let's go.

610
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:52,050
Or you have it ripped away just
when you figured out you wanted it?

611
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:54,949
I am sorry your shit is broken.

612
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,864
But the Penny I've heard
about wouldn't give a damn

613
00:30:56,888 --> 00:30:58,686
whether it fucks
the future or not.

614
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,691
He would do the right
thing for his friend.

615
00:31:02,494 --> 00:31:04,520
I guess having your shit
break changes a person.

616
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:05,596
Okay.

617
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:09,330
So what kind of person
is new Penny gonna be?

618
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:14,038
Shit.

619
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,580
I know how to get us back home.

620
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,171
Let's do this and I'll explain.

621
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:21,545
Oh, okay.

622
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:24,145
He's gonna be sore
when he wakes up.

623
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:27,285
If he wakes up.

624
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:34,415
You ready to go? Yeah.

625
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:39,091
"Quentin Coldwater,
Welters..." How does that help?

626
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:43,602
I dropped it the day you
reappeared. When it broke, it...

627
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:45,534
Became a new thing.

628
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:49,097
Made the day we
left. So, shall we?

629
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:51,041
Yeah.

630
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:56,372
He's stable.

631
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:58,182
Thank you.

632
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,741
And talking words good.

633
00:32:00,218 --> 00:32:03,848
My work here is done.
Respect, here I come. FEN: Oh.

634
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:04,922
Shit.

635
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:11,188
All right. Talk.

636
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,641
It's been centuries since
I've been able to speak.

637
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:16,396
It's so liberating.

638
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:18,469
You've been
infected for centuries?

639
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:22,507
Yeah. From the... Just after
your reign ended until today.

640
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,372
Tell us everything
that happened.

641
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,106
Screw that. What's
up with the Dark King?

642
00:32:27,212 --> 00:32:29,532
Who is he, where does he come
from, and how do we kill him?

643
00:32:30,215 --> 00:32:33,777
Well, I heard the
same story you did.

644
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:36,454
The Dark King showed up

645
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:38,649
shortly after the
arrival of the Takers.

646
00:32:38,757 --> 00:32:41,454
That only he could
vanquish them.

647
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,988
So I was curious.
Who was this Magician?

648
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:47,292
What was his story?

649
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:49,061
So I sought him out.

650
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:53,071
And I was shocked to
discover that I knew him.

651
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:57,303
You are good at telling stories.

652
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:58,501
Thank you.

653
00:32:58,777 --> 00:33:04,808
Now, in order to talk about who he
is, and where he actually came from,

654
00:33:04,883 --> 00:33:06,818
we need to look further back.

655
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:10,014
To a time before Martin
Chatwin became The Beast.

656
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:11,714
Mmm. Shh. Really?

657
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:15,354
<i>Long before he
discovered the Wellspring,</i>

658
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,692
<i>Martin had another
plan to make sure</i>

659
00:33:18,797 --> 00:33:21,357
<i>that he never got
sent back to Earth.</i>

660
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:24,868
<i>A conduit spell to
tie himself to Fillory.</i>

661
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,871
Once we begin, we will
only have a few moments.

662
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:33,570
Seb, we should talk about this.

663
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,442
Look, we know what
you're trying to do.

664
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:36,846
I strongly doubt that.

665
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:40,919
We know it. The Dark King used it.
Except we chopped down his tree.

666
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:43,648
But there's an essential fact

667
00:33:43,722 --> 00:33:46,715
that perhaps you don't
know about the trees of Fillory.

668
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:50,819
You see, there are many,
but in truth, only one.

669
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:52,859
What kind of bullshit is that?

670
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:55,992
Yeah. I mean, I'm Fillorian
and I have never heard that.

671
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:59,469
You see, the roots of the
trees of Fillory intertwine,

672
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:00,870
such that they become one,

673
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:03,465
not just with each
other, but with the land.

674
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:06,569
And anyone tied
to that can't be killed

675
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:10,615
by just chopping down a single
tree or, pfft, even an entire forest.

676
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,513
They can only be stopped

677
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:14,849
by destroying all of Fillory.

678
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:18,421
Wait. So you're saying Martin
tried, but screwed up or whatever?

679
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:19,616
He was thwarted,

680
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:23,354
by someone heroic who
knew what he could become.

681
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:25,897
Martin's own brother, Rupert.

682
00:34:26,965 --> 00:34:29,696
Rupert Sebastian Chatwin.

683
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:34,399
Oh, my gods, what a twist.
You're such a natural at this.

684
00:34:34,506 --> 00:34:38,500
<i>He realized that the only way
to stop his brother was sacrifice.</i>

685
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:41,945
<i>So he tied himself to the
conduit before his brother could.</i>

686
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:46,947
<i>When Martin discovered what
had happened, oh, he was furious.</i>

687
00:34:47,052 --> 00:34:49,283
<i>He couldn't kill
his own brother.</i>

688
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:52,619
<i>But he could curse
him with eternal sleep.</i>

689
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:54,818
<i>The people of Fillory
thought he was dead.</i>

690
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:03,695
What's happening to him?

691
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:04,895
Exactly what's meant to.

692
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:08,100
What happened?

693
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,571
You happened.

694
00:35:10,542 --> 00:35:13,569
You brought surges of magic,

695
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:17,741
so huge you woke Rupert
up. And he brought the Takers.

696
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:19,717
And then when he
held them at bay,

697
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:23,186
the Fillorians, in gratitude,
made him High King.

698
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:27,851
But why did he do all that?

699
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:31,452
Yeah. If he was so good,
why did he become so evil?

700
00:35:31,563 --> 00:35:34,192
Because while he slumbered,

701
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:37,758
he lost the one
thing he cared about.

702
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:39,600
<i>The man he loved.</i>

703
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:47,477
Rupert? Is that really you?

704
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:49,771
Lance?

705
00:35:50,115 --> 00:35:51,139
Lance Morrison?

706
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:52,443
Rupert!

707
00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:58,413
Yes. Yes, it's me.

708
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,958
Finally. You're here.

709
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:03,321
My love, my stars, my heart.

710
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:05,830
I sound like a fool.

711
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,026
You cannot know...

712
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:10,898
Do you know how
much I missed you?

713
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:16,240
What took you so long?

714
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:19,774
Lance, I've... I've been trying.

715
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,040
You left me.

716
00:36:22,147 --> 00:36:24,241
No. You abandoned me.

717
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:26,341
No, I needed to stop my brother.

718
00:36:26,451 --> 00:36:29,148
And now I'm dead,
and you can never die.

719
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:34,653
It's cold here. I'm so alone.

720
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:38,664
Oh, I've almost given
up so many times.

721
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:41,029
No, for, you see, don't.

722
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:43,933
I will not break my
promise to you. Okay?

723
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,004
I finally know what to do.

724
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:48,199
We'll be together soon. So soon.

725
00:36:48,273 --> 00:36:49,901
How? Just wait by the door.

726
00:36:50,008 --> 00:36:52,739
I've tried. I can't
pass through it.

727
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:55,006
No, I know. But you
will be able to soon.

728
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,557
That's why I reached
out to you, to tell you

729
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:57,947
to wait by the door.

730
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,348
Okay. Okay.

731
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:05,854
Rupert.

732
00:37:05,924 --> 00:37:08,120
Listen to me. Wait by the door.

733
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:12,762
Eliot. What the fuck did you do?

734
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,681
And you actually think this
page might contain the answer?

735
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:21,863
Tell us what you need. Our
resources are at your disposal.

736
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,431
I just need to go and get it.

737
00:37:23,541 --> 00:37:24,541
We'll send someone.

738
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:26,773
I'd rather get it myself.

739
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:30,872
A few Librarians, security.
Seems prudent to send one person.

740
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:37,384
You almost had me. Just peanut
butter and turkey sandwiches.

741
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:38,980
I'm afraid I'm not following.

742
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,114
We're in the Library,

743
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:43,525
where there's glitches
'cause of Hedges, right? Mmm.

744
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:46,565
So why do these glitches keep
happening during lunar intervals?

745
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:48,896
Why are the Neitherlands
affected by the Earth's moon?

746
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:51,095
Makes no sense.
Where am I, really?

747
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:57,973
Earth. Which you manage to
figure out every motherfucking time.

748
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,244
What is this? Some
sort of illusion?

749
00:38:04,315 --> 00:38:05,442
Psychic spell.

750
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,243
Basically, you're in the Matrix.

751
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:10,618
Which means we're still
on Earth. Hence, glitches.

752
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:12,819
How many times have I done this?

753
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:15,826
Eighteen.

754
00:38:15,927 --> 00:38:18,624
Been sending you back to the
beginning. It's getting tiresome.

755
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:21,365
Wait, the books, fixing
the moon. It was all just...

756
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:24,935
Bullshit. Starting with you
getting Kady to text me.

757
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,303
Who are you?

758
00:38:26,371 --> 00:38:30,331
Come on. I'm insulted.
You've been asking about me.

759
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:32,270
The Couple.

760
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:35,780
Less impressive the
18th time you figure it out.

761
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:38,339
Look, you're sick of
this, I'm really sick of this.

762
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:41,146
Why don't we have this
convo in the real world, huh?

763
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:48,282
Not doing this 19 times.

764
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:51,329
Give me the
page, or I kill Kady.

765
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,771
How do I know
that's really Kady?

766
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,365
How do I know this is even real?

767
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:08,872
Only one way to know,
and that's to feel it.

768
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,145
What are you doing?

769
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,010
Phosphoromancer, right?

770
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:18,949
Please don't do this. Please.

771
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,992
I know you use
this finger a lot. No!

772
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:28,258
Promise.

773
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:31,825
Give me the page. If the
finger's still viable, I reattach.

774
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:42,812
Middle finger,
also very important.

775
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,610
Love spells need a ring finger.

776
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:51,681
Pinkies are crucial.

777
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:02,864
Well, Alice?

778
00:40:04,302 --> 00:40:05,302
Okay.

779
00:40:06,871 --> 00:40:07,871
Okay.

780
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:10,030
Well, do you want my thumb, too?

781
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:15,406
Disappointed this isn't working,

782
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:19,212
because the next cut
isn't your thumb. It's Kady.

783
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:26,024
The page, or kill Kady?
What's it gonna be?

784
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:30,255
Okay. Okay, you win. It's yours.

785
00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:32,457
It's fucking yours.

786
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:34,054
Oh, good.

787
00:40:36,668 --> 00:40:39,729
Relieved. Now, where do I go?

788
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:43,105
Oh, hold that thought.
I forgot my pen.

789
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:46,834
Okay.

790
00:40:56,988 --> 00:40:58,115
Is he all right?

791
00:40:58,222 --> 00:40:59,485
What do you care?

792
00:41:00,158 --> 00:41:02,992
It was never my
intention to hurt him.

793
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:05,056
You think that matters?

794
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:10,124
I lost someone, too.

795
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:13,799
And I loved him so much.

796
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,339
I know the pain.

797
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:21,810
It's not an excuse to hurt people
just because you want him back.

798
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:27,483
Maybe you didn't love
him as much as you think.

799
00:41:28,086 --> 00:41:30,282
Because you don't understand.

800
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:33,515
I have work to do.

801
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:39,182
<i>You see what you're up against.</i>

802
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:45,031
Fillory can never be free so
long as the Dark King reigns.

803
00:41:45,737 --> 00:41:48,206
One thing I'm confused about.

804
00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:50,002
Where do you
fit into all of this?

805
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:55,374
Well, Rupert recognized me.
Oh, he's always disliked me.

806
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,450
He's the one who cursed
me with the Tongue Twisters.

807
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:02,381
Well, I shall find no happiness
in Fillory so long as he's around.

808
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:06,385
So after you leave here,
what? Just gonna hit the streets?

809
00:42:06,491 --> 00:42:10,553
Oh, hardly. I shall write.

810
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:13,197
The things I have seen.

811
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:16,191
The stories I can tell.

812
00:42:16,401 --> 00:42:18,529
His stories are very good.

813
00:42:18,603 --> 00:42:20,504
Just not exactly
kid-appropriate.

814
00:42:23,074 --> 00:42:24,167
Oh. Oh.

815
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:28,873
Vexing. Oh, flattery flophouse.

816
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:34,178
Did you really have to do that?
He seemed like such a nice...

817
00:42:34,252 --> 00:42:36,244
Pedophile? He's
grooming you, Fen,

818
00:42:36,354 --> 00:42:37,754
because you act like you're 12.

819
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:39,414
Oh, gods.

820
00:42:39,524 --> 00:42:42,221
Remember, make sure to
lock on the right vibration.

821
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:48,698
Can you feel it?

822
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:49,766
Mmm.

823
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:51,368
It feels like home.

824
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:56,166
Here we go.

825
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:02,246
Hi.

826
00:43:03,214 --> 00:43:04,214
I think...

827
00:43:04,282 --> 00:43:05,875
I think... I think we did it.

828
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:06,974
Oh.

829
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:08,519
Shall I let go of your hand?

830
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:14,052
This... Did you...

831
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:17,660
No. Not on purpose.

832
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:20,459
I'm not sure how I
even did this at all.

833
00:43:20,832 --> 00:43:22,130
Oh, why do I feel like I've...

834
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:25,169
Been here before?
Because this is it.

835
00:43:26,304 --> 00:43:28,603
This is where the
signal brought us.

836
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:32,074
Okay, okay. I'll
just travel us out.

837
00:43:32,143 --> 00:43:33,143
Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

838
00:43:36,647 --> 00:43:38,912
Plum? It's not working.

839
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:41,447
We can't leave.
