Minor clean up By
DvX3M

3
00:00:06,201 --> 00:00:07,899
- Previously
on "The Magicians"...

4
00:00:08,005 --> 00:00:09,006
- Christopher Plover.

5
00:00:09,081 --> 00:00:10,125
- The children's book author?

6
00:00:10,271 --> 00:00:11,489
- You're familiar with my work.

7
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:13,143
- I've read
Martin Chatwin's book.

8
00:00:13,187 --> 00:00:15,711
- Oh, you're the pervert
who turned him into The Beast.

9
00:00:15,754 --> 00:00:18,714
- The age suspension spells
Martin used,

10
00:00:18,757 --> 00:00:20,498
they must still
be keeping me alive.

11
00:00:20,542 --> 00:00:22,500
- I don't know
what this signal is,

12
00:00:22,544 --> 00:00:24,154
but I know why
it's targeting me,

13
00:00:24,198 --> 00:00:26,200
and I'm gonna figure out--
- Whoa, whoa, hang on!

14
00:00:26,243 --> 00:00:28,071
- Merritt, you don't know
what that's gonna do.

15
00:00:28,115 --> 00:00:29,507
- You're right.

16
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:33,207
- Ever since I found this page,
I knew it was important.

17
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,296
- It's an instruction manual.
- For what?

18
00:00:35,339 --> 00:00:36,384
- The World Seed.

19
00:00:36,427 --> 00:00:37,689
It can grow
into almost anything,

20
00:00:37,733 --> 00:00:39,387
even an entire world.

21
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,215
The Couple has been looking
for the World Seed page

22
00:00:41,258 --> 00:00:43,695
a long time,
and they are not good people.

23
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:45,697
- And they know
I have what they want.

24
00:00:45,741 --> 00:00:47,438
- Pregnant.

25
00:00:47,482 --> 00:00:48,483
- Shit.

26
00:00:48,526 --> 00:00:49,527
Really appreciate it
if we could

27
00:00:49,571 --> 00:00:50,702
keep this between you and I.

28
00:00:50,746 --> 00:00:51,747
- Of course.

29
00:00:53,923 --> 00:00:56,099
- Let's go find our books,
shall we?

30
00:00:56,143 --> 00:00:58,232
- You better be able
to speed-read.

31
00:00:59,407 --> 00:01:01,104
- No!

32
00:01:01,148 --> 00:01:02,410
- Okay, so what if
we locate the tree

33
00:01:02,453 --> 00:01:04,194
from Seb's tattoo
and chop it down?

34
00:01:04,238 --> 00:01:05,369
Would that sever this conduit?

35
00:01:05,413 --> 00:01:07,371
- In theory, yes,

36
00:01:07,415 --> 00:01:10,548
he would be mortal
and 100% stabbable.

37
00:01:19,731 --> 00:01:22,604
- Jesus, cock and balls,
what's keeping Julia and El?

38
00:01:22,647 --> 00:01:24,432
We just murdered
the goddamn king back there.

39
00:01:24,475 --> 00:01:25,737
They should act like it.
- Ooh, sorry.

40
00:01:25,781 --> 00:01:27,348
Probably just
Julia's toe worms.

41
00:01:27,391 --> 00:01:29,698
Hey, we should stop
so she can catch up.

42
00:01:29,741 --> 00:01:30,829
- You've got toe worms,

43
00:01:30,873 --> 00:01:32,222
and you're moving
at a normal speed.

44
00:01:32,266 --> 00:01:33,745
- Oh, I'm just used to--

45
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:35,486
Hey, what happened to your eye?

46
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,314
- I lent it to Josh.

47
00:01:37,358 --> 00:01:39,621
- What happened to his eye?

48
00:01:39,664 --> 00:01:41,362
- Nothing!
He's an idiot.

49
00:01:41,405 --> 00:01:42,928
He went back to warn
Tick and Rafe to get out

50
00:01:42,972 --> 00:01:44,756
before things go shit-shaped.
- Okay.

51
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,541
- Wait, and so why did you--

52
00:01:46,584 --> 00:01:50,197
- I'm worried, so I'm
keeping an eye on him, okay?

53
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,589
Christ.
- Oh, it's a pun.

54
00:01:51,633 --> 00:01:53,417
I get it,
'cause you gave him your eye.

55
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:55,637
- Shut the fuck up, Fen!

56
00:01:57,247 --> 00:01:58,683
- Okay.

57
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:03,253
- Julia, you have to hurry.
Are you okay?

58
00:02:03,297 --> 00:02:05,342
- Yeah, I'm just
a little out of shape.

59
00:02:05,386 --> 00:02:07,344
- Okay, don't mean to push,
but since we don't know

60
00:02:07,388 --> 00:02:09,259
how the Centurions
will react to Seb's body,

61
00:02:09,303 --> 00:02:11,609
and you were intimately
involved in making him dead,

62
00:02:11,653 --> 00:02:13,916
we should probably
move more quickly.

63
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:15,874
- Uh...Eliot.

64
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:20,792
- I wouldn't if I were you.

65
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:24,927
- Seb.

66
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,537
- Surprised?

67
00:02:28,322 --> 00:02:29,932
Take them.

68
00:02:48,255 --> 00:02:49,865
- Shit.

69
00:02:54,783 --> 00:02:56,263
Sorry about that, Quentin.

70
00:02:58,526 --> 00:03:00,658
Lame-ass Welters nerd.

71
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:03,661
- Merritt?

72
00:03:03,705 --> 00:03:05,837
- What--what happened?

73
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:07,317
- You tell me.

74
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:10,233
You said you were a Chatwin,
you ripped off your patch,

75
00:03:10,277 --> 00:03:11,800
and then you disappeared.

76
00:03:11,843 --> 00:03:14,977
- Where's Julia
and--and Lipson and--

77
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,807
- You've been gone three weeks.

78
00:03:19,721 --> 00:03:20,852
- Wha...

79
00:03:22,027 --> 00:03:23,899
It was just a room.

80
00:03:23,942 --> 00:03:27,337
No windows, no doors,

81
00:03:27,381 --> 00:03:29,252
no one else there.

82
00:03:29,296 --> 00:03:30,993
That's all I remember.

83
00:03:31,036 --> 00:03:33,256
- You remember more than I did
when the signal grabbed me.

84
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,259
But I was there seconds,
at least I thought.

85
00:03:36,303 --> 00:03:38,479
Who knows how this shit works?

86
00:03:38,522 --> 00:03:41,482
- It's a weird one.
- What do your rocks say?

87
00:03:42,396 --> 00:03:45,312
- That young Merritt
isn't under any memory curses,

88
00:03:45,355 --> 00:03:47,444
so far as I can see.

89
00:03:47,488 --> 00:03:50,534
- My name is actually Plum,
remember?

90
00:03:50,578 --> 00:03:52,057
I just have to own it.

91
00:03:52,101 --> 00:03:55,060
Leave the ranks of Chatwins
who go by middle names

92
00:03:55,104 --> 00:03:57,802
or nicknames or, you know,
super-villain monikers.

93
00:03:57,846 --> 00:04:01,458
Hi, Plum fucking Chatwin,
cursed freak.

94
00:04:01,502 --> 00:04:05,027
- Well, on the plus,
you don't have a brain injury,

95
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,333
you aren't psychotic,

96
00:04:06,376 --> 00:04:08,509
and except for
the disorientation

97
00:04:08,552 --> 00:04:11,468
and a little bit
of combination skin,

98
00:04:11,512 --> 00:04:13,731
you're perfectly healthy.

99
00:04:13,775 --> 00:04:15,907
- Whoa, whoa, so--what?

100
00:04:15,951 --> 00:04:17,866
You're done?

101
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:20,042
- Well, first I'm gonna grab
a bottle of tequila

102
00:04:20,085 --> 00:04:21,478
so that I can really enjoy

103
00:04:21,522 --> 00:04:23,393
my post-coma
limited work hours,

104
00:04:23,437 --> 00:04:24,525
but, uh, after that,

105
00:04:24,568 --> 00:04:26,396
yeah, I'm done.

106
00:04:29,138 --> 00:04:30,835
- Look, this weird room,

107
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,402
that's more
than we've had to go on.

108
00:04:32,446 --> 00:04:35,797
- It's also nothing to go on
at all.

109
00:04:38,103 --> 00:04:40,018
- The way traveling works,

110
00:04:40,062 --> 00:04:42,412
you imagine a place,

111
00:04:42,456 --> 00:04:43,500
see it in your mind's eye,

112
00:04:43,544 --> 00:04:45,589
and then just go.

113
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:47,330
What?

114
00:04:47,374 --> 00:04:49,550
- You do know this is the most
you've actually taught

115
00:04:49,593 --> 00:04:51,508
about traveling
since you took up here.

116
00:04:51,552 --> 00:04:53,336
- Look, my point is,

117
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,077
you don't have to point
on a map.

118
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,471
Just picture it.

119
00:04:57,514 --> 00:04:58,776
- You want me to go back?

120
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,430
- Not really,
because it's dangerous,

121
00:05:00,474 --> 00:05:01,475
but just pointing out--

122
00:05:01,518 --> 00:05:02,954
- That it's
the only thing we have,

123
00:05:02,998 --> 00:05:04,608
is what you're pointing out.

124
00:05:04,652 --> 00:05:06,741
- When I was a first year,
I had this stupid idea

125
00:05:06,784 --> 00:05:09,134
that teachers knew
a ton more than me.

126
00:05:09,178 --> 00:05:10,614
Gonna blow it for you.

127
00:05:10,658 --> 00:05:12,790
Pretty much no one
knows dick about anything,

128
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:14,792
especially traveler shit.

129
00:05:14,836 --> 00:05:16,664
What the signal is, why,

130
00:05:16,707 --> 00:05:18,013
no one's waiting around
to solve it.

131
00:05:18,056 --> 00:05:21,016
- But I've never
traveled by myself,

132
00:05:21,059 --> 00:05:22,452
and I don't know how,

133
00:05:22,496 --> 00:05:25,499
and even assuming you're not
completely a shit teacher,

134
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:27,457
I can't go back there,
not alone.

135
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:28,850
- You won't be.

136
00:05:32,114 --> 00:05:34,551
- Oh, you stupid twat.

137
00:05:34,595 --> 00:05:36,031
That hurts.

138
00:05:36,074 --> 00:05:38,468
- Kind of late to ask
for the anesthesia spell.

139
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,646
- Done.

140
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,388
Now you can take people
with you when you travel,

141
00:05:45,432 --> 00:05:47,477
which is why it is important
that you--

142
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:49,436
- Yes, I read the chapters
you gave me.

143
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:51,829
I get the principles.

144
00:05:51,873 --> 00:05:53,657
- We start with baby steps.

145
00:05:53,701 --> 00:05:56,617
All you gotta do is travel us
both across the lab.

146
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,619
Now, I'm gonna draw a circle.

147
00:05:58,662 --> 00:06:01,404
Just aim for it.

148
00:06:01,448 --> 00:06:02,666
And don't worry.

149
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,016
If you get lost,
I'll be right there.

150
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,541
- Professor Adiyodi...
- It's Penny.

151
00:06:07,584 --> 00:06:08,716
- Bringing you my troubles

152
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,152
has cocked things up
enough already.

153
00:06:10,195 --> 00:06:12,459
I don't wanna make things
worse.

154
00:06:12,502 --> 00:06:14,417
- Yeah, well,
messing up my life

155
00:06:14,461 --> 00:06:15,418
kind of runs in your family.

156
00:06:15,462 --> 00:06:16,550
I'm used to it.

157
00:06:16,593 --> 00:06:18,160
- You're not convincing me.

158
00:06:21,685 --> 00:06:23,078
- Which Chatwin are you
related to?

159
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:25,428
- Honestly, I don't know.

160
00:06:25,472 --> 00:06:26,516
My parents are British.

161
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,561
They have the proper sense

162
00:06:27,604 --> 00:06:29,650
not to speak
of the family curse.

163
00:06:29,693 --> 00:06:31,652
- Well, you are the third
Chatwin I've met.

164
00:06:32,783 --> 00:06:33,958
First one was The Beast,

165
00:06:34,002 --> 00:06:35,917
who basically tortured me
when I was a kid,

166
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,049
but his sister Jane,

167
00:06:38,093 --> 00:06:40,182
she did everything she could
to stop him.

168
00:06:40,225 --> 00:06:43,228
She changed time.

169
00:06:43,272 --> 00:06:45,622
She was incredible.

170
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:48,886
So family curse?

171
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,149
Far as I'm concerned,
the scales are even.

172
00:06:51,193 --> 00:06:52,629
You could tip it either way.

173
00:06:54,588 --> 00:06:58,069
Remember, aim for the circle.

174
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:03,074
Here goes nothing.

175
00:07:06,687 --> 00:07:08,776
I did it.
I actually did it.

176
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:11,082
I honestly thought I was
just gonna, like, kill us both.

177
00:07:11,126 --> 00:07:12,910
Like, straight up
50/50 chance--

178
00:07:12,954 --> 00:07:15,870
- Plum.
- Yeah.

179
00:07:15,913 --> 00:07:16,958
- Where's the chalk circle?

180
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:19,917
- It--it's--huh?

181
00:07:25,532 --> 00:07:27,055
- Hey, where's everybody going?

182
00:07:27,098 --> 00:07:29,753
- Dean Shiring got dial-up
in the computer closet.

183
00:07:29,797 --> 00:07:31,755
We're gonna use it
to read the Starr Report,

184
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:33,801
or at least the blow job parts.

185
00:07:33,844 --> 00:07:35,716
- Dial-up?
- Starr Report?

186
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,762
That came out--oh.

187
00:07:38,806 --> 00:07:41,548
I traveled us to 1998.

188
00:07:41,591 --> 00:07:44,289
- Yeah, well,
I have a strong guess

189
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:45,987
which Chatwin
you're related to.

190
00:07:47,075 --> 00:07:49,251
- "The Couple"?
Never heard of 'em.

191
00:07:49,294 --> 00:07:50,687
- I hadn't either
until they sent

192
00:07:50,731 --> 00:07:53,560
a shiitake monster after me.

193
00:07:53,603 --> 00:07:54,648
I'd like to know who they are

194
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:56,214
before they come
looking for me again.

195
00:07:57,868 --> 00:07:59,783
- Well, I know a guy.

196
00:07:59,827 --> 00:08:01,002
He owes me, like, three favors,

197
00:08:01,045 --> 00:08:02,830
so let's see.

198
00:08:02,873 --> 00:08:04,005
- Thanks, Kady.

199
00:08:06,007 --> 00:08:08,183
- Now you owe me three favors.
- Hmm.

200
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:12,796
- He wants to meet.

201
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,802
You are never
gonna believe where.

202
00:08:21,022 --> 00:08:22,545
What the hell happened here?

203
00:08:23,764 --> 00:08:25,069
- We've been redecorating.

204
00:08:25,113 --> 00:08:27,724
Alice and Kady,
I'm so very glad you've come.

205
00:08:27,768 --> 00:08:29,552
- Zelda.
- What are you doing here?

206
00:08:29,596 --> 00:08:30,988
- Rebuilding.

207
00:08:31,032 --> 00:08:32,294
Come to see George, yes?

208
00:08:33,251 --> 00:08:34,688
- Didn't know you knew him.

209
00:08:34,731 --> 00:08:36,777
He's right over there.

210
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,303
- Hey, how did all this happen?

211
00:08:41,346 --> 00:08:43,827
Are those hedges
working with librarians?

212
00:08:43,871 --> 00:08:46,177
- Honestly, it was you.

213
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:48,005
After you helped me
burn all those books,

214
00:08:48,049 --> 00:08:49,180
I realized the Library

215
00:08:49,224 --> 00:08:51,182
needed to be rebuilt
from the ground up.

216
00:08:51,226 --> 00:08:52,967
- How did you convince them
to help you?

217
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,664
- I've been helping
Kady and Harriet

218
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:55,926
remove Reed's Marks--

219
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,015
a sort of penance,
if we're being honest--

220
00:08:58,059 --> 00:08:59,669
but suddenly I found myself
surrounded

221
00:08:59,713 --> 00:09:02,193
by grateful magicians just
looking for something to do.

222
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:05,196
- What was that?

223
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,024
- Our new recruits
are enthusiastic,

224
00:09:07,068 --> 00:09:09,026
but their education is spotty.

225
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,681
This branch is kept functioning
by very specific spells,

226
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:13,727
but proper casting,
especially here

227
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,903
in the Circumstances
of the Neitherlands,

228
00:09:15,946 --> 00:09:17,208
sometimes eludes them.

229
00:09:17,252 --> 00:09:20,951
- Alice, this is George.

230
00:09:20,995 --> 00:09:23,171
- So you're the one
The Couple's after.

231
00:09:23,214 --> 00:09:24,172
- Do you know them?

232
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:26,609
- No, but I know
a guy who might.

233
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:28,742
I need a day to track him down.

234
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:31,701
- Thanks, George.

235
00:09:31,745 --> 00:09:32,920
Two favors to go.

236
00:09:34,922 --> 00:09:36,706
- As long as your waiting,

237
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,665
perhaps you could help us
with a problem?

238
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,362
I've pulled some volumes
from the Poison Room.

239
00:09:40,405 --> 00:09:42,059
Highly dangerous.

240
00:09:42,103 --> 00:09:44,975
You're some of the few
I trust to look through them.

241
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:46,803
- What are you looking for?

242
00:09:46,847 --> 00:09:48,283
- A way to fix magic.

243
00:09:49,937 --> 00:09:53,593
Unless you have something
more important to do.

244
00:09:59,076 --> 00:10:00,904
- Thank God we got past
the Centurions.

245
00:10:00,948 --> 00:10:02,906
- How the hell's
the Dark King still alive?

246
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,952
We cut down his tree,
stabbed him.

247
00:10:04,995 --> 00:10:06,257
- It doesn't seem possible.

248
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:07,694
- El said he's a healer.

249
00:10:07,737 --> 00:10:09,130
Maybe he cast something
with his last breath.

250
00:10:09,173 --> 00:10:12,176
I don't know,
but our friends are back there.

251
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:16,659
I can see Josh hiding out,
so he's safe for now,

252
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,182
but Julia and Eliot...

253
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:22,273
- Did they get back here
before us?

254
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:29,803
- Hey!

255
00:10:29,846 --> 00:10:31,674
Who the fuck are you?

256
00:10:31,718 --> 00:10:34,242
- Ah, cello.

257
00:10:34,285 --> 00:10:36,940
Squirrel, daffodil.

258
00:10:36,984 --> 00:10:38,420
- Okay.

259
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,987
- Uh, Margo,
what are you doing?

260
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,292
- Life lesson, Fen.

261
00:10:41,336 --> 00:10:43,294
There's always a point
where you can decide,

262
00:10:43,338 --> 00:10:44,948
"That's not my problem."

263
00:10:44,992 --> 00:10:46,950
- Oh, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

264
00:10:46,994 --> 00:10:50,258
- We have friends to save,
a Dark King to re-kill.

265
00:10:51,738 --> 00:10:53,435
Hang with Mad Libs pedophile
all you want.

266
00:10:53,478 --> 00:10:55,306
I'm going back to double-tap
the motherfucker

267
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,744
like he's Osama
and I'm SEAL Team Bitch.

268
00:10:57,787 --> 00:10:59,746
- No, no.
Excelsior in springtime.

269
00:10:59,789 --> 00:11:01,269
Excelsior in springtime.

270
00:11:01,312 --> 00:11:02,705
- Whatever you say.

271
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:05,795
- I think he's trying
to tell us something

272
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,798
about Fillory
and the Dark King?

273
00:11:09,843 --> 00:11:11,801
- Charcuterie.

274
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:19,417
- Either he had a stroke,

275
00:11:19,461 --> 00:11:20,854
or some whimsical
Fillorian shit happened to him.

276
00:11:20,897 --> 00:11:22,203
- Secrets and blueberries.

277
00:11:22,246 --> 00:11:24,292
Spongy walrus hat.

278
00:11:25,597 --> 00:11:27,034
- On the edge
of the Burnt River,

279
00:11:27,077 --> 00:11:28,905
there's an insect called
the Tongue Twister

280
00:11:28,949 --> 00:11:31,429
that supposedly
crawls into your skull

281
00:11:31,473 --> 00:11:32,430
and confuses your words.

282
00:11:32,474 --> 00:11:34,084
Is that like a stroke?

283
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:35,433
- Fingernail clippings.

284
00:11:35,477 --> 00:11:37,348
- Hold up.

285
00:11:37,392 --> 00:11:39,089
Somebody's near Josh.

286
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:41,178
Son of a shit,
it's the Dark King.

287
00:11:41,222 --> 00:11:42,353
He's coming.

288
00:11:42,397 --> 00:11:44,529
Wait, no!
God damn it!

289
00:11:44,573 --> 00:11:45,617
- What happened?

290
00:11:45,661 --> 00:11:47,010
- Josh put my eye
in his pocket,

291
00:11:47,054 --> 00:11:48,533
so I can't see shit.

292
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:52,929
If he's got something to say
about the Dark King,

293
00:11:52,973 --> 00:11:54,452
we need to know it.

294
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:55,845
- How?

295
00:11:55,889 --> 00:11:57,368
If he's got Tongue Twisters
in his brain hole?

296
00:11:57,412 --> 00:11:58,456
- I know a guy.

297
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,110
He's an idiot,

298
00:12:00,154 --> 00:12:02,330
but he might be able to help.

299
00:12:07,117 --> 00:12:08,815
- Professor Fogg?

300
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,295
- Hi.

301
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:12,993
- Ski masks.

302
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:16,213
Big trend in the future?

303
00:12:16,257 --> 00:12:17,911
- Trying to avoid
a time paradox.

304
00:12:17,954 --> 00:12:21,044
- Ah, smart and stupid.

305
00:12:21,088 --> 00:12:22,959
You don't think I'll recognize
your voices?

306
00:12:23,003 --> 00:12:24,613
- Kind of counted on you
being a little drunk.

307
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:27,485
- It's the afternoon.

308
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:30,140
- Next time,
try Pinter's facial distortion,

309
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:31,968
literally made
for this sort of thing,

310
00:12:32,012 --> 00:12:34,971
unless you, you know,
prefer this look.

311
00:12:35,015 --> 00:12:38,322
- Yeah, look, what do you know
about time travelers?

312
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:40,934
They're a myth.

313
00:12:40,977 --> 00:12:43,414
- And yet, here we are.

314
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:48,289
- Well, seems like you have
a gift, Ms. Ski Mask,

315
00:12:48,332 --> 00:12:50,160
but poor aim.

316
00:12:50,204 --> 00:12:52,032
- Can you help?

317
00:12:53,163 --> 00:12:54,208
- Maybe.

318
00:12:56,993 --> 00:13:00,214
This time bridge is set
for a fixed moment in time,

319
00:13:00,257 --> 00:13:04,348
but we can remove
the temporal compass

320
00:13:04,392 --> 00:13:09,223
and adjust it to help you
navigate back to 2020.

321
00:13:09,266 --> 00:13:11,007
Can you feel the vibration?
- Yeah.

322
00:13:11,051 --> 00:13:13,183
- Good.
It's pointing towards home.

323
00:13:13,227 --> 00:13:14,445
- Thanks, Professor Fogg.

324
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:16,317
- No, gosh,
thank you, thank you.

325
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,536
This might all make
an excellent dissertation.

326
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,408
- Might even be worth
a promotion.

327
00:13:20,451 --> 00:13:21,670
- Oh, God, no.

328
00:13:21,713 --> 00:13:23,454
Me, Dean?
No.

329
00:13:23,498 --> 00:13:26,370
I'd have to pay off
a lot of colleagues' wives.

330
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:29,809
Good luck.

331
00:13:38,774 --> 00:13:40,341
- Did it work?

332
00:13:40,384 --> 00:13:41,995
Are we back?

333
00:13:42,038 --> 00:13:43,344
- I don't know.

334
00:13:53,136 --> 00:13:54,398
- Excuse me.

335
00:13:54,442 --> 00:13:56,052
Be a pal and sweep up
the men's dining room?

336
00:13:56,096 --> 00:13:57,097
Thanks.

337
00:13:59,664 --> 00:14:00,665
- Nope.

338
00:14:02,363 --> 00:14:04,278
- How is Seb still alive?

339
00:14:04,321 --> 00:14:05,583
- I have no idea.

340
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:08,456
I mean, you saw me
run him through with a sword,

341
00:14:08,499 --> 00:14:10,762
which is not something
I expected to do

342
00:14:10,806 --> 00:14:13,287
to anyone, kind of ever.

343
00:14:16,768 --> 00:14:18,161
- You okay?

344
00:14:18,205 --> 00:14:20,381
- Yeah, um,
I just have a problem,

345
00:14:20,424 --> 00:14:21,948
and it's getting worse.

346
00:14:28,171 --> 00:14:30,521
- How'd you get so pregnant?

347
00:14:30,565 --> 00:14:33,698
- The usual way,
except it's Red Monkey Month,

348
00:14:33,742 --> 00:14:36,266
so everything grows
a lot faster.

349
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:39,443
- I guess...

350
00:14:39,487 --> 00:14:40,967
congratulations?

351
00:14:44,013 --> 00:14:46,581
Ugh.
- Thanks, I think.

352
00:14:46,624 --> 00:14:48,017
- Present deal aside,

353
00:14:48,061 --> 00:14:50,237
the whole circle of life
of this,

354
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,803
it's kind of very moving.

355
00:14:51,847 --> 00:14:53,805
- In a far less
dungeon-y timeline,

356
00:14:53,849 --> 00:14:55,677
I'd definitely be asking you

357
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,722
to throw me a baby shower
right about now.

358
00:14:57,766 --> 00:15:00,116
- I know a spell
to make sparkling cider

359
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,335
get you hammered.

360
00:15:01,378 --> 00:15:02,510
Perfect loophole
for this situation.

361
00:15:03,815 --> 00:15:05,817
- Glad to see you're
keeping your spirits up.

362
00:15:05,861 --> 00:15:08,733
I wouldn't want it
gloomy down here.

363
00:15:08,777 --> 00:15:11,432
And now I've killed
the conversation.

364
00:15:14,261 --> 00:15:16,654
- Are you going to execute us?

365
00:15:16,698 --> 00:15:19,005
- I can't.

366
00:15:19,048 --> 00:15:20,484
I need your help.

367
00:15:22,878 --> 00:15:25,272
- Basic problem's the same.

368
00:15:25,315 --> 00:15:27,796
We can't fix magic on Earth.

369
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,712
We did some stuff to the moon,
and she's mad, and she's--

370
00:15:30,755 --> 00:15:34,324
- A monumental cunt?
- Evidently.

371
00:15:34,368 --> 00:15:36,413
So she's screwing up
Circumstances.

372
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,679
- My Akkadian's rusty,
but I--I think this says

373
00:15:41,723 --> 00:15:47,076
that we can win
the moon's favor if we...

374
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,599
- Virgin sacrifice.

375
00:15:48,643 --> 00:15:51,037
- Okay, well, that's out.

376
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,081
- Not to mention,

377
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,214
the method of death
is pretty gross.

378
00:15:56,564 --> 00:15:57,695
- That bad, huh?

379
00:15:57,739 --> 00:15:59,610
- No, it's just
the lights flickered,

380
00:15:59,654 --> 00:16:03,440
and now there's peanut butter
in my turkey sandwich.

381
00:16:04,572 --> 00:16:07,444
- Thought wonky casting
was an Earth-specific problem.

382
00:16:07,488 --> 00:16:10,056
- I think this issue's
more basic.

383
00:16:10,099 --> 00:16:12,188
All the new people
learning Library operations,

384
00:16:12,232 --> 00:16:14,538
including culinary charms.

385
00:16:14,582 --> 00:16:17,889
- At least Zelda can reassign
hedges that cast for shit.

386
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:20,283
The moon, however,
has job security.

387
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:22,546
You're fired, Moon.

388
00:16:24,592 --> 00:16:26,202
Wait, what if we could?

389
00:16:27,247 --> 00:16:29,336
Fire the moon, I mean.

390
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:30,467
- Kind of remember hearing

391
00:16:30,511 --> 00:16:32,208
Earth would end
in fiery apocalypse.

392
00:16:32,252 --> 00:16:34,471
- No, I'm saying,
what if we got rid of it

393
00:16:34,515 --> 00:16:35,690
and made a new one?

394
00:16:37,909 --> 00:16:39,607
That's batshit.

395
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:41,522
- This book is on
Earth-works magic

396
00:16:41,565 --> 00:16:43,741
in the South Pacific.

397
00:16:43,785 --> 00:16:45,787
You know, how to create
an island out of nothing.

398
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,398
- Ye--that's not exactly
the same.

399
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:50,357
- These books are from
the Poison Room,

400
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,488
not for amateurs.

401
00:16:51,532 --> 00:16:52,750
If there's a way
to make a new moon,

402
00:16:52,794 --> 00:16:53,751
it'll be in here.

403
00:17:01,107 --> 00:17:03,283
- Say, "Ah."
- Fire engine.

404
00:17:04,936 --> 00:17:07,374
- Well, there's your problem.
He can't talk right.

405
00:17:07,417 --> 00:17:09,158
- No shit, Gordy.
We wanna know why.

406
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:11,508
- Check his ears.
Anything in there?

407
00:17:12,683 --> 00:17:15,512
Just your usual ear stuff.

408
00:17:15,556 --> 00:17:18,124
Hold up, what is that?

409
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:20,430
Give me a minute.
It's deep in there.

410
00:17:21,388 --> 00:17:24,217
And blammo.

411
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,569
- Yep, it's a Tongue Twister.

412
00:17:28,612 --> 00:17:30,049
- How you feeling now?

413
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:32,181
Linoleum.

414
00:17:32,225 --> 00:17:33,965
- Shit, it wasn't the bug.

415
00:17:34,009 --> 00:17:36,316
- Huh, well,
maybe not this one.

416
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:38,622
There's a bunch in there.

417
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,972
Hundreds.

418
00:17:41,016 --> 00:17:42,539
Thousands.

419
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:45,151
All down his--mm...

420
00:17:45,194 --> 00:17:47,022
spinal bones?

421
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,938
I can get 'em out
if I can keep one.

422
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:52,071
- Sure I'll regret asking.
Why?

423
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:54,029
- For the respect.

424
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,163
So I can write a...
a...

425
00:17:57,206 --> 00:17:59,643
- Paper?
- Right, one of those.

426
00:17:59,687 --> 00:18:01,993
It'd be huge for me.

427
00:18:02,037 --> 00:18:03,517
I'll never get laughed at
at VetCon again.

428
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,475
- How long is it gonna take?

429
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:07,390
- Don't know.

430
00:18:07,434 --> 00:18:10,611
Looks like each critter
has an energy-meridian tether

431
00:18:10,654 --> 00:18:12,526
as well as a physical one.

432
00:18:12,569 --> 00:18:14,005
It's like he's possessed

433
00:18:14,049 --> 00:18:16,965
by a thousand little spirits,
so...

434
00:18:17,008 --> 00:18:18,662
- This is a possession problem?

435
00:18:18,706 --> 00:18:20,577
- No, it's a bug problem,

436
00:18:20,621 --> 00:18:22,971
and those bugs
are possessing him.

437
00:18:27,715 --> 00:18:30,021
- Don't worry.
I deal with cats all day.

438
00:18:30,065 --> 00:18:32,111
They are possessed
like you wouldn't believe.

439
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:33,329
- Rhubarb.

440
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:42,425
- That should do it.

441
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:45,036
- He's bleeding out!
Call a doctor!

442
00:18:46,473 --> 00:18:48,170
Oh, yeah.

443
00:18:53,523 --> 00:18:55,656
- 1920.

444
00:18:55,699 --> 00:18:58,789
- Maybe Fogg flipped a digit
setting it.

445
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,313
If we can figure out
what he got wrong,

446
00:19:00,356 --> 00:19:02,097
we can fix his mistake.

447
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,187
I just wish we had
some instructions.

448
00:19:05,231 --> 00:19:07,146
- Excuse me.

449
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:10,149
This area is for students
and faculty only.

450
00:19:10,192 --> 00:19:11,802
- I am faculty.
- I'm a student.

451
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:15,066
- And I am the King of Siam.
Out.

452
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,329
- Look, dude,
I don't know wha--

453
00:19:16,372 --> 00:19:17,460
- Yeah, getting in a fight

454
00:19:17,504 --> 00:19:19,070
is only gonna make this harder.

455
00:19:20,768 --> 00:19:22,465
Thank you.

456
00:19:31,822 --> 00:19:33,737
- If we can't
get in the Library,

457
00:19:33,781 --> 00:19:36,087
then we are stuck here
reenacting "The Help"

458
00:19:36,131 --> 00:19:37,480
with these casually racist
white people.

459
00:19:37,524 --> 00:19:39,395
- Lilian,
you're imagining things.

460
00:19:39,439 --> 00:19:41,658
- We don't know anyone here
who can help us.

461
00:19:41,702 --> 00:19:44,270
- I swear, Helen,
I could sense something--

462
00:19:44,313 --> 00:19:47,795
someone--
watching me in the bath,

463
00:19:47,838 --> 00:19:50,711
like--like a pervert ghost.

464
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:55,585
- Maybe we do know someone
who can help.

465
00:19:56,717 --> 00:20:00,199
- "Of one not easily jealous,
but being wrought,

466
00:20:00,242 --> 00:20:03,463
"perplexed in the extreme;

467
00:20:03,506 --> 00:20:07,206
"of one whose hand,
like the base Indian,

468
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:10,078
threw a pearl away
richer than all his tribe..."

469
00:20:10,121 --> 00:20:13,603
- You're telling me
this guy whacks off to people

470
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:16,215
he watches
from the Astral Plane?

471
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:20,436
- Yeah.
- "The melting mood..."

472
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,222
- Do we really need his help?
- "As the Arabian trees..."

473
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:24,397
- Look, in 100 years,

474
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,834
he's gonna be
a really nice guy, so...

475
00:20:28,444 --> 00:20:30,490
- Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

476
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:32,187
It just, it--ah.

477
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,451
It won't feel like "Othello"
until I'm in blackface.

478
00:20:36,626 --> 00:20:39,325
- Okay, so he's got
a ways to go.

479
00:20:39,368 --> 00:20:40,587
Hyman.

480
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,241
Hey.

481
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:43,677
- Do I know you?

482
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,682
- Uh, yeah, I'm Pen--brooke,
and this is Prune.

483
00:20:48,725 --> 00:20:53,556
- Ah, and you are
visiting mystics?

484
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,343
- Right, from India, and--
- And the--

485
00:20:57,386 --> 00:20:59,127
- The Dark Continent.
- Okay.

486
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,650
- God give me strength.

487
00:21:00,694 --> 00:21:02,652
- Yeah, well, listen,
we needed some help--

488
00:21:02,696 --> 00:21:03,914
- I'm sorry.
I'm late to phrenology.

489
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,351
- Okay, buddy.

490
00:21:05,394 --> 00:21:08,397
Listen up, dude.

491
00:21:08,441 --> 00:21:10,921
We know you're the pervert
ghost of Brakebills,

492
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:14,490
so either you help us,
or everybody knows.

493
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:19,930
- I've looked through
everything Seb gave us,

494
00:21:19,974 --> 00:21:23,891
and it seems like some sort
of communication spell.

495
00:21:23,934 --> 00:21:25,849
It's going to take
the three of us.

496
00:21:26,894 --> 00:21:30,941
I have no clue
what it does, though.

497
00:21:33,422 --> 00:21:34,858
- El?

498
00:21:34,902 --> 00:21:36,469
Help here?

499
00:21:36,512 --> 00:21:38,775
What's the point?

500
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:41,865
Once we're done, what reason
does he have to keep us alive?

501
00:21:42,866 --> 00:21:45,347
- I don't think he'll kill us.

502
00:21:45,391 --> 00:21:46,914
You.

503
00:21:47,741 --> 00:21:50,178
I saw the way he talked to you.

504
00:21:50,221 --> 00:21:52,441
Nobody is that hurt
if they don't care.

505
00:21:54,356 --> 00:21:56,663
- I attract the best guys,
don't I?

506
00:21:57,838 --> 00:22:00,536
- You attract
basically everyone,

507
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,321
and with that broad
of an appeal,

508
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:03,409
you're bound to magnetize

509
00:22:03,452 --> 00:22:04,932
a couple of questionable
monarchs.

510
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:09,328
- We will figure something out.
I promise.

511
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:10,329
- Okay.

512
00:22:12,896 --> 00:22:14,463
- Help.
- Okay.

513
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:20,991
- This sigil,
it looks sort of like

514
00:22:21,035 --> 00:22:22,863
part of a messenger charm
that you would use

515
00:22:22,906 --> 00:22:25,300
to send a letter
across a lake or a river--

516
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,649
- Oh, shit.

517
00:22:26,693 --> 00:22:28,869
Yeah, I recognize it.

518
00:22:28,912 --> 00:22:30,827
Um, it was in a book

519
00:22:30,871 --> 00:22:33,917
I was reading
right after Q died.

520
00:22:33,961 --> 00:22:36,703
I was doing a lot of...
- Grief Googling?

521
00:22:38,487 --> 00:22:40,489
- He wants to do a séance.

522
00:22:40,533 --> 00:22:41,838
- But I thought
those were bullshit.

523
00:22:41,882 --> 00:22:43,536
- Not always.

524
00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:47,278
It's dark magic,
and it can go very wrong.

525
00:22:47,322 --> 00:22:49,933
I never could figure it out,
but maybe he did.

526
00:22:49,977 --> 00:22:51,413
- But why cooperative?

527
00:22:51,457 --> 00:22:52,893
Three people
means a lot of power.

528
00:22:52,936 --> 00:22:55,286
- Well, he must be trying
to contact someone

529
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:57,767
who's been dead
a very long time.

530
00:22:57,811 --> 00:22:59,682
- Oh, shit.

531
00:23:00,857 --> 00:23:02,772
I think I know who.

532
00:23:07,255 --> 00:23:09,039
- Hello, Professor Frank.

533
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:13,435
- Those two can't be in here
during regular hours.

534
00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:15,263
- Uh, they're with me.

535
00:23:15,306 --> 00:23:17,961
I'm doing a report
on magic of the West Indies.

536
00:23:18,005 --> 00:23:20,921
They are translating for me.

537
00:23:24,141 --> 00:23:27,101
- Nothing, nothing.
There is nothing here.

538
00:23:27,144 --> 00:23:29,016
It is all theoretical.

539
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:31,410
There's not even an entry
for a temporal compass.

540
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:33,020
- As far as I can tell,
time bridges

541
00:23:33,063 --> 00:23:34,761
haven't even been
invented yet.

542
00:23:37,241 --> 00:23:38,808
- Time bridges?

543
00:23:38,852 --> 00:23:40,244
Like Professor Sato's work?

544
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:44,466
- Is that...

545
00:23:46,076 --> 00:23:48,035
Hey.
- Yeah.

546
00:23:49,036 --> 00:23:50,994
- This looks exactly like
the time bridge

547
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:53,301
that we pulled
the compass out of.

548
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:56,435
He's building it...
- Today.

549
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:58,393
That can't be a coincidence.

550
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,482
- But still,
it doesn't make any sense.

551
00:24:00,526 --> 00:24:02,179
I mean, why take us here,
to today?

552
00:24:02,223 --> 00:24:04,051
And why 1998?

553
00:24:04,094 --> 00:24:06,183
- Wh-wh-wh-wh-wh...

554
00:24:06,227 --> 00:24:10,231
You traveled
to the year of our Lord 1998?

555
00:24:10,274 --> 00:24:12,973
No, no, no.
Horsefeathers.

556
00:24:13,016 --> 00:24:15,541
What, was the world overrun
with metal automatons

557
00:24:15,584 --> 00:24:18,065
taking over
all the work of men?

558
00:24:18,108 --> 00:24:19,893
- Yes.
- Look.

559
00:24:19,936 --> 00:24:20,937
Oh, my God.

560
00:24:20,981 --> 00:24:22,417
- September, 1998.

561
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,767
- I was holding it
when we traveled to 1998,

562
00:24:24,811 --> 00:24:27,770
and then I was
holding the compass

563
00:24:27,814 --> 00:24:30,860
that was made today
when we landed here today.

564
00:24:30,904 --> 00:24:33,210
- Oh, they're totems.

565
00:24:34,864 --> 00:24:37,998
Remedial traveler students
sometimes have trouble

566
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:41,044
picturing their destinations,
so holding an object

567
00:24:41,088 --> 00:24:42,916
from that place
can sometimes help.

568
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:46,833
- Okay, so that,
but time instead of space.

569
00:24:46,876 --> 00:24:48,791
So I guess in order
to get home...

570
00:24:48,835 --> 00:24:50,227
- We need something
from our time.

571
00:24:50,271 --> 00:24:52,795
- "From our time,"
I was gonna say that.

572
00:24:57,887 --> 00:25:00,281
- Hey, you know this language?

573
00:25:02,588 --> 00:25:04,285
- Um...

574
00:25:04,328 --> 00:25:07,462
the front half looks like
Old Church Slavonic.

575
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,029
The back half,
I don't recognize it.

576
00:25:09,072 --> 00:25:10,813
- The Slavonic part
I could read.

577
00:25:10,857 --> 00:25:14,121
It's something about a seed
that could grow into anything.

578
00:25:14,164 --> 00:25:18,081
What if it could
grow into a moon?

579
00:25:26,394 --> 00:25:28,309
- I don't believe it.
- What?

580
00:25:31,355 --> 00:25:33,836
- This book is missing a page,

581
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,838
something called
the World Seed.

582
00:25:35,882 --> 00:25:37,057
- How do you know
what it's about

583
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,275
if the page is missing?

584
00:25:39,668 --> 00:25:41,409
- Because it's what
The Couple's after,

585
00:25:41,452 --> 00:25:44,238
the page, and I have it.

586
00:25:44,281 --> 00:25:45,718
- What?

587
00:25:45,761 --> 00:25:48,851
- Meanwhile, we're trying
to solve a different problem,

588
00:25:48,895 --> 00:25:51,593
but then--but there's this book
that happens to be

589
00:25:51,637 --> 00:25:54,465
the same book that
the World Seed page came from?

590
00:25:54,509 --> 00:25:57,164
Coincidence,
synchronicity, or...

591
00:25:57,207 --> 00:25:58,992
- I always assume trap.

592
00:25:59,035 --> 00:26:01,124
- How much do you
trust the hedges?

593
00:26:01,168 --> 00:26:03,387
- About as much
as you trust the Library.

594
00:26:05,215 --> 00:26:08,088
Then there's no way
this isn't a con.

595
00:26:08,131 --> 00:26:11,352
- We're looking for an answer
that requires unusual power.

596
00:26:11,395 --> 00:26:13,484
Something unusually powerful.

597
00:26:13,528 --> 00:26:16,270
Logically, it's gonna be rare,

598
00:26:16,313 --> 00:26:17,619
a lot of people wanting it,
right?

599
00:26:17,663 --> 00:26:21,188
So not weird, right?

600
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:25,018
Just saying.
- True.

601
00:26:25,061 --> 00:26:28,282
I mean, it can't be this easy,
can it?

602
00:26:28,325 --> 00:26:30,632
- Maybe everything's been
really hard for a long time,

603
00:26:30,676 --> 00:26:33,330
and we caught a single
fucking break for once.

604
00:26:36,116 --> 00:26:38,292
- Oh, hey,
Smoothie Castle card

605
00:26:38,335 --> 00:26:40,686
from 2009.

606
00:26:40,729 --> 00:26:44,690
- So we don't have anything
from 2020?

607
00:26:44,733 --> 00:26:47,997
Great, so we're just stuck
in this backwards-ass place.

608
00:26:49,129 --> 00:26:50,434
- Did you do this?

609
00:26:50,478 --> 00:26:51,610
- Do what?

610
00:26:51,653 --> 00:26:54,395
- Brakebills has given me
the icy mitt.

611
00:26:54,438 --> 00:26:56,179
I've been streeted.

612
00:26:56,223 --> 00:26:58,225
Oh, my--expelled!

613
00:26:58,268 --> 00:27:00,401
Someone ratted me out
to the faculty.

614
00:27:00,444 --> 00:27:01,663
- Well, it wasn't us.

615
00:27:03,099 --> 00:27:05,449
Someone must have overheard
our conversation.

616
00:27:05,493 --> 00:27:07,713
- Wha--eavesdropping
on a private moment?

617
00:27:07,756 --> 00:27:08,714
Who would do that?

618
00:27:08,757 --> 00:27:11,194
- You, constantly,

619
00:27:11,238 --> 00:27:14,284
which is why
you're getting expelled.

620
00:27:16,156 --> 00:27:19,986
- Did you give her permission
to use irony in this way?

621
00:27:20,029 --> 00:27:24,033
Just--good riddance
to the both of you.

622
00:27:24,077 --> 00:27:26,122
- This is bad.

623
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:28,647
He was supposed to stay,
get caught projecting,

624
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:30,997
and then be trapped
when someone hides his body.

625
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:34,261
- Okay, so then expulsion
actually saves him

626
00:27:34,304 --> 00:27:37,438
from being trapped in
Astral Purgatory for a century

627
00:27:37,481 --> 00:27:40,267
and saves generations
of Brakebills women

628
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,486
from being spied on.
- You don't get it.

629
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:45,489
If Hyman doesn't get trapped,
he can't help future me,

630
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:50,233
and future me can't save magic,
and we lose it forever.

631
00:27:53,019 --> 00:27:54,281
We need to fix this.

632
00:27:54,324 --> 00:27:55,630
How?

633
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:58,764
By trapping him ourselves?

634
00:27:58,807 --> 00:28:00,243
- Exactly.

635
00:28:02,028 --> 00:28:03,159
- Wait.

636
00:28:11,385 --> 00:28:15,215
On the bright side, this is my
chance to finally go to Europe.

637
00:28:17,347 --> 00:28:19,088
I hear Weimar Berlin's
got some swell

638
00:28:19,132 --> 00:28:20,611
"erotique" attractions.

639
00:28:21,787 --> 00:28:23,223
- I bet.

640
00:28:28,054 --> 00:28:30,186
- God, what am I doing?

641
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,667
I came to Brakebills
to learn, you know?

642
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,322
And the lesson of my expulsion
is clear as a creek.

643
00:28:35,365 --> 00:28:39,369
Maybe, and I know
this is crazy,

644
00:28:39,413 --> 00:28:44,157
but maybe it is wrong
to spy on people in the shower.

645
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,724
- Well...

646
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:47,377
- I know!

647
00:28:47,421 --> 00:28:49,597
Then why did God
give you the ability

648
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,730
to spy on people in the shower?

649
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:56,473
- Look, I can't tell you
how to live your life, but...

650
00:28:59,302 --> 00:29:01,522
Look, being a traveler
can feel like a burden, yes,

651
00:29:01,565 --> 00:29:05,439
but not being a traveler,

652
00:29:05,482 --> 00:29:07,093
not being able
to use your gift,

653
00:29:07,136 --> 00:29:08,529
it's worse.

654
00:29:08,572 --> 00:29:09,748
Believe me.

655
00:29:12,402 --> 00:29:15,188
There's no harm
in looking, right?

656
00:29:16,493 --> 00:29:18,582
You know?

657
00:29:18,626 --> 00:29:21,716
You're a good egg, Penbrooke.

658
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,761
- Okay.

659
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:27,504
- Hey, before I forget,

660
00:29:27,548 --> 00:29:29,855
any idea how I can
score some tickets

661
00:29:29,898 --> 00:29:31,247
to the women's Welters match?

662
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:32,596
It's in an hour.

663
00:29:34,903 --> 00:29:36,775
- Women's Welters
has a match tonight?

664
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:39,299
That's not on the schedule.

665
00:29:39,342 --> 00:29:41,562
- Oh, it's a surprise match,
yeah.

666
00:29:43,303 --> 00:29:46,741
They are probably
in the locker room right now.

667
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,309
I see.

668
00:29:49,352 --> 00:29:52,747
I am going to need
to finish packing by myself.

669
00:29:54,531 --> 00:29:55,663
In private, okay?

670
00:29:55,706 --> 00:29:57,273
- Yeah, okay. Cool.

671
00:29:57,317 --> 00:29:59,885
Great.
Uh, yeah, bye.

672
00:30:05,281 --> 00:30:06,326
Okay, it worked.
We only have a few minutes.

673
00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:09,285
- Okay, um,
hear me out on something.

674
00:30:09,329 --> 00:30:10,504
- Yes, it's bad.

675
00:30:10,547 --> 00:30:11,592
Magic's at stake.

676
00:30:11,635 --> 00:30:12,593
Do I have to do
the speech again?

677
00:30:12,636 --> 00:30:13,812
- I stole this

678
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:15,422
from Professor Sato's things.

679
00:30:15,465 --> 00:30:17,859
Stasis charm,
freezes the wearer in time.

680
00:30:17,903 --> 00:30:20,819
- Plum, the body isn't
supposed to be preserved.

681
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:22,821
It's supposed to die.
- Who says?

682
00:30:22,864 --> 00:30:24,474
- No one ever found his body.

683
00:30:24,518 --> 00:30:26,520
Maybe we were the ones
who hid it in the first place.

684
00:30:26,563 --> 00:30:27,782
- That's not how time works.

685
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,262
How do you know?

686
00:30:29,305 --> 00:30:31,568
What matters is he'd
still be trapped

687
00:30:31,612 --> 00:30:32,787
and still be on
the Astral Plane.

688
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,571
- Unless it's
a shitty hiding spot,

689
00:30:34,615 --> 00:30:35,572
and Hyman finds it.

690
00:30:35,616 --> 00:30:36,747
- Unless he doesn't,

691
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:39,228
and 100 years from now
we can fix him.

692
00:30:39,272 --> 00:30:41,665
What's the point of having
this stupid ability

693
00:30:41,709 --> 00:30:43,363
if I can't change anything?

694
00:30:43,406 --> 00:30:44,712
- Who says there's a point?

695
00:30:44,755 --> 00:30:45,931
You are born with this shit,

696
00:30:45,974 --> 00:30:47,323
and you spend the rest
of your life

697
00:30:47,367 --> 00:30:48,368
trying to survive it.

698
00:30:48,411 --> 00:30:50,283
Okay? Let's go.

699
00:30:51,458 --> 00:30:53,939
- Or you have it ripped away

700
00:30:53,982 --> 00:30:56,289
just when you figured out
you wanted it.

701
00:30:56,332 --> 00:31:00,423
I am sorry your shit is broken,
but the Penny I've heard about

702
00:31:00,467 --> 00:31:02,817
wouldn't give a damn whether it
fucks the future or not.

703
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,863
He would do the right thing
for his friend.

704
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,692
- I guess having your shit
break changes a person.

705
00:31:08,736 --> 00:31:10,303
- Okay,

706
00:31:10,346 --> 00:31:13,523
so what kind of person
is new Penny gonna be?

707
00:31:17,745 --> 00:31:19,225
- Shit.

708
00:31:19,268 --> 00:31:20,748
I know how to get us
back home.

709
00:31:22,706 --> 00:31:24,491
Let's do this,
and I'll explain.

710
00:31:24,534 --> 00:31:25,971
- Okay.

711
00:31:26,014 --> 00:31:28,277
Gonna be sore
when he wakes up.

712
00:31:29,539 --> 00:31:31,846
- If he wakes up.

713
00:31:37,025 --> 00:31:39,201
You ready to go?
- Yeah.

714
00:31:39,245 --> 00:31:42,291
"Quentin Coldwater,
Welters"--

715
00:31:42,335 --> 00:31:44,206
how does that help?

716
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,773
- I dropped it the day
you reappeared.

717
00:31:45,816 --> 00:31:48,428
When it broke, it...

718
00:31:48,471 --> 00:31:49,690
- Became a new thing.

719
00:31:49,733 --> 00:31:53,476
- Made the day we left,
so shall we?

720
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,738
- Yeah.

721
00:31:59,613 --> 00:32:00,875
- He's stable.

722
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,398
- Thank you.

723
00:32:02,442 --> 00:32:03,834
- And talking words good.

724
00:32:03,878 --> 00:32:05,706
My work here is done.

725
00:32:05,749 --> 00:32:07,490
Respect, here I come.

726
00:32:07,534 --> 00:32:09,275
Shit.

727
00:32:12,669 --> 00:32:15,455
- All right, talk.

728
00:32:15,498 --> 00:32:17,718
- It's been centuries
since I've been able to speak.

729
00:32:17,761 --> 00:32:20,590
It's so liberating.

730
00:32:20,634 --> 00:32:22,679
- You've been infected
for centuries?

731
00:32:22,723 --> 00:32:26,727
- Yes, from the--just after
your reign ended until today.

732
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:29,338
- Tell us everything
that happened.

733
00:32:29,382 --> 00:32:31,253
- Screw that.
What's up with the Dark King?

734
00:32:31,297 --> 00:32:32,559
Who is he,
where does he come from,

735
00:32:32,602 --> 00:32:34,387
and how do we kill him?

736
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:37,999
- Well, I heard
the same story you did.

737
00:32:38,043 --> 00:32:40,567
The Dark King showed up

738
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,917
shortly after the arrival
of The Takers,

739
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,789
that only he
could vanquish them.

740
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:48,357
So I was curious.

741
00:32:48,401 --> 00:32:50,272
Who was this Magician?

742
00:32:50,316 --> 00:32:51,491
What was his story?

743
00:32:51,534 --> 00:32:53,362
So I sought him out,

744
00:32:53,406 --> 00:32:56,278
and I was shocked to discover

745
00:32:56,322 --> 00:32:57,323
that I knew him.

746
00:32:58,759 --> 00:33:01,544
Ooh, you are good
at telling stories.

747
00:33:01,588 --> 00:33:02,719
- Thank you.

748
00:33:02,763 --> 00:33:06,636
Now, in order to talk
about who he is

749
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,943
and where he actually
came from,

750
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,945
we need to look further back

751
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:14,383
to a time before Martin Chatwin
became The Beast.

752
00:33:14,427 --> 00:33:15,950
- Really?
- Shh.

753
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:19,519
- Long before he discovered
the Wellspring,

754
00:33:19,562 --> 00:33:22,043
Martin had another plan

755
00:33:22,087 --> 00:33:25,568
to make sure that he never
got sent back to Earth.

756
00:33:25,612 --> 00:33:29,529
A conduit spell
to tie himself to Fillory.

757
00:33:29,572 --> 00:33:31,792
- Once we begin, we will
only have a few moments.

758
00:33:33,968 --> 00:33:37,754
- Seb, we should talk
about this.

759
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:39,495
- Look, we know
what you're trying to do.

760
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:40,975
- I strongly doubt that.

761
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,063
- We know it.

762
00:33:42,107 --> 00:33:43,456
The Dark King used it,

763
00:33:43,499 --> 00:33:45,023
except we chopped down
his tree.

764
00:33:45,066 --> 00:33:47,808
- But there's an essential fact

765
00:33:47,851 --> 00:33:50,767
that perhaps you don't know
about the trees of Fillory.

766
00:33:50,811 --> 00:33:54,989
You see, there are many,
but in truth, only one.

767
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,991
- What kind of bullshit
is that?

768
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:00,081
- Yeah, I mean, I'm Fillorian,
and I've never heard that.

769
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:03,563
- You see, the roots of
the trees of Fillory intertwine

770
00:34:03,606 --> 00:34:06,566
such that they become one,
not just with each other,

771
00:34:06,609 --> 00:34:09,786
but with the land,
and anyone tied to that

772
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:12,528
can't be killed by just
chopping down a single tree

773
00:34:12,572 --> 00:34:14,835
or even an entire forest.

774
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:19,013
They can only be stopped
by destroying all of Fillory.

775
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,494
- Wait, so you're saying
Martin tried,

776
00:34:21,537 --> 00:34:22,625
but screwed up or whatever?

777
00:34:22,669 --> 00:34:25,846
- He was thwarted
by someone heroic

778
00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:27,543
who knew what he could become,

779
00:34:27,587 --> 00:34:30,981
Martin's own brother Rupert,

780
00:34:31,025 --> 00:34:33,680
Rupert Sebastian Chatwin.

781
00:34:33,723 --> 00:34:36,900
- Oh, my Gods, what a twist.

782
00:34:36,944 --> 00:34:38,641
You're such a natural at this.

783
00:34:38,685 --> 00:34:40,556
- He realized
that the only way

784
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,558
to stop his brother
was sacrifice,

785
00:34:42,602 --> 00:34:44,865
so he tied himself
to the conduit

786
00:34:44,908 --> 00:34:46,127
before his brother could.

787
00:34:46,171 --> 00:34:48,738
When Martin discovered
what had happened,

788
00:34:48,782 --> 00:34:50,958
oh, he was furious.

789
00:34:51,001 --> 00:34:53,526
He couldn't kill
his own brother,

790
00:34:53,569 --> 00:34:56,877
but he could curse him
with eternal sleep.

791
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,966
The people of Fillory
thought he was dead.

792
00:35:06,756 --> 00:35:08,758
- What's happening to him?
- Exactly what's meant to.

793
00:35:10,978 --> 00:35:12,414
- What happened?

794
00:35:12,458 --> 00:35:14,634
- You happened.

795
00:35:14,677 --> 00:35:20,074
You brought surges of magic
so huge you woke Rupert up,

796
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,684
and he brought The Takers,

797
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,904
and then when he held them
at bay,

798
00:35:23,947 --> 00:35:27,429
the Fillorians, in gratitude,
made him High King.

799
00:35:27,473 --> 00:35:31,825
- But why did he do all that?

800
00:35:31,868 --> 00:35:35,742
- Yeah, if he was so good,
why did he become so evil?

801
00:35:35,785 --> 00:35:38,571
- Because while he slumbered,

802
00:35:38,614 --> 00:35:41,922
he lost the one thing
he cared about,

803
00:35:41,965 --> 00:35:43,619
the man he loved.

804
00:35:48,233 --> 00:35:51,627
- Rupert, is that really you?

805
00:35:51,671 --> 00:35:52,759
- Lance!

806
00:35:52,802 --> 00:35:54,152
- Lance?

807
00:35:54,195 --> 00:35:56,110
- Lance Morrison?
- Rupert.

808
00:36:00,897 --> 00:36:02,943
- Yes, yes, it's me.

809
00:36:02,986 --> 00:36:04,858
- Finally, you're here.

810
00:36:04,901 --> 00:36:07,469
My love, my stars, my heart.

811
00:36:07,513 --> 00:36:09,689
I sound like a fool.

812
00:36:10,994 --> 00:36:12,170
You cannot know...

813
00:36:12,213 --> 00:36:14,737
Do you know how much
I've missed you?

814
00:36:18,698 --> 00:36:20,047
- What took you so long?

815
00:36:21,744 --> 00:36:23,224
- Lance, I've been trying.

816
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,228
- You left me.
- No.

817
00:36:27,272 --> 00:36:28,621
- You abandoned me.

818
00:36:28,664 --> 00:36:30,492
- No, I needed
to stop my brother.

819
00:36:30,536 --> 00:36:32,973
- And now I'm dead,
and you can never die.

820
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:38,587
It's cold here.
I'm so alone.

821
00:36:41,024 --> 00:36:42,852
I've almost given up
so many times.

822
00:36:42,896 --> 00:36:45,203
- No, no, just--don't.

823
00:36:45,246 --> 00:36:48,162
I will not break my promise
to you, okay?

824
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,033
I finally know what to do.

825
00:36:50,077 --> 00:36:52,166
We'll be together soon,
so soon.

826
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,037
- How?
- Just wait by the door.

827
00:36:54,081 --> 00:36:56,997
- I've tried.
I can't pass through it.

828
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,217
- No, I know, but you will
be able to soon.

829
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,522
That's why
I reached out to you,

830
00:37:00,566 --> 00:37:02,002
to tell you to wait
by the door.

831
00:37:02,045 --> 00:37:04,700
Okay, okay.

832
00:37:08,661 --> 00:37:10,010
Rupert...

833
00:37:10,053 --> 00:37:11,011
- Listen to me.

834
00:37:11,054 --> 00:37:12,839
Wait by the door.

835
00:37:12,882 --> 00:37:14,101
- Eliot.

836
00:37:15,624 --> 00:37:17,147
What the fuck did you do?

837
00:37:19,324 --> 00:37:20,760
- And you actually think
this page

838
00:37:20,803 --> 00:37:21,891
might contain the answer?

839
00:37:23,066 --> 00:37:24,198
Tell us what you need.

840
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,069
Our resources
are at your disposal.

841
00:37:26,113 --> 00:37:27,680
- I just need to go and get it.

842
00:37:27,723 --> 00:37:29,072
- We'll send someone.

843
00:37:29,116 --> 00:37:30,944
- I'd rather get it myself.

844
00:37:30,987 --> 00:37:32,946
- A few librarians, security--

845
00:37:32,989 --> 00:37:34,730
seems prudent
to send one person.

846
00:37:35,905 --> 00:37:37,733
- You almost had me.

847
00:37:37,777 --> 00:37:41,302
Just peanut butter
and turkey sandwiches.

848
00:37:41,346 --> 00:37:43,043
- I'm afraid I'm not following.

849
00:37:43,086 --> 00:37:45,741
- We're in the Library,
where there's glitches

850
00:37:45,785 --> 00:37:47,787
'cause of hedges right?

851
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,223
So why do these glitches
keep happening

852
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,703
during lunar intervals?

853
00:37:50,746 --> 00:37:52,879
Why are the Neitherlands
affected by the Earth's moon?

854
00:37:52,922 --> 00:37:55,142
Makes no sense.
Where am I really?

855
00:37:57,797 --> 00:38:00,234
- Earth, which you manage
to figure out

856
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,757
every motherfucking time.

857
00:38:06,632 --> 00:38:08,242
- What is this?
Some sort of illusion?

858
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,722
- Psychic spell.

859
00:38:09,765 --> 00:38:11,332
Basically you're in the Matrix,

860
00:38:11,376 --> 00:38:14,857
which means we're still
on Earth, hence glitches.

861
00:38:14,901 --> 00:38:16,903
- How many times
have I done this?

862
00:38:16,946 --> 00:38:18,078
- 18.

863
00:38:20,123 --> 00:38:21,342
Been sending you back
to the beginning.

864
00:38:21,386 --> 00:38:22,909
It's getting tiresome.

865
00:38:22,952 --> 00:38:24,998
- Wait, the--the books,
fixing the moon,

866
00:38:25,041 --> 00:38:26,739
it was all just--
- Bullshit.

867
00:38:26,782 --> 00:38:29,350
Starting with you
getting Kady to text me.

868
00:38:29,394 --> 00:38:30,960
- Who are you?
- Come on.

869
00:38:31,004 --> 00:38:32,353
I'm insulted.

870
00:38:32,397 --> 00:38:35,095
You've been asking about me.

871
00:38:35,138 --> 00:38:36,357
- The Couple.

872
00:38:36,401 --> 00:38:37,619
- Less impressive

873
00:38:37,663 --> 00:38:39,882
the 18th time
you figure it out.

874
00:38:39,926 --> 00:38:41,144
Look, you're sick of this.

875
00:38:41,188 --> 00:38:42,581
I'm really sick of this.

876
00:38:42,624 --> 00:38:45,671
Why don't we have this convo
in the real world, huh?

877
00:38:49,936 --> 00:38:52,417
Not doing this 19 times.

878
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:55,420
Give me the page,
or I kill Kady.

879
00:39:02,688 --> 00:39:05,430
- How do I know
that's really Kady?

880
00:39:05,473 --> 00:39:07,170
How do I know
this is even real?

881
00:39:08,433 --> 00:39:10,391
- Only one way to know,

882
00:39:10,435 --> 00:39:12,654
and that's to feel it.

883
00:39:15,396 --> 00:39:17,398
- What are you doing?

884
00:39:17,442 --> 00:39:20,401
- Phosphoromancer, right?

885
00:39:20,445 --> 00:39:21,663
- Please don't do this.

886
00:39:21,707 --> 00:39:22,838
Please, please.

887
00:39:22,882 --> 00:39:24,405
- I know you use
this finger a lot.

888
00:39:30,672 --> 00:39:32,892
- Promise--
give me the page.

889
00:39:32,935 --> 00:39:35,285
If the finger's still viable,
I reattach.

890
00:39:41,553 --> 00:39:45,774
- Middle finger,
also very important.

891
00:39:49,256 --> 00:39:50,736
- Love spells
need a ring finger.

892
00:39:53,303 --> 00:39:54,653
- Pinkies are crucial.

893
00:40:03,226 --> 00:40:06,665
- Well? Alice?

894
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:09,189
- Okay.

895
00:40:10,233 --> 00:40:11,931
Okay.

896
00:40:11,974 --> 00:40:13,628
You want my thumb too?

897
00:40:16,501 --> 00:40:18,851
- Disappointed
that this isn't working,

898
00:40:18,894 --> 00:40:21,462
because the next cut
isn't your thumb.

899
00:40:21,506 --> 00:40:23,377
It's Kady.

900
00:40:25,292 --> 00:40:27,816
- The page, or kill Kady.

901
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,644
What's it gonna be?

902
00:40:29,688 --> 00:40:33,474
- Okay, okay, you win.
It's yours.

903
00:40:33,518 --> 00:40:35,998
It's--it's fucking yours.

904
00:40:36,042 --> 00:40:37,957
- Oh, good.

905
00:40:40,263 --> 00:40:41,482
- Relieved.

906
00:40:41,526 --> 00:40:43,615
Now, where do I go?

907
00:40:43,658 --> 00:40:45,486
Oh, hold that thought.

908
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:47,619
I forgot my pen.

909
00:40:49,577 --> 00:40:51,840
Okay.

910
00:41:00,588 --> 00:41:01,546
- Is he all right?

911
00:41:01,589 --> 00:41:03,591
- What do you care?

912
00:41:03,635 --> 00:41:06,855
- It was never my intention
to hurt him.

913
00:41:06,899 --> 00:41:08,988
- You think that matters?

914
00:41:11,991 --> 00:41:13,732
I lost someone too.

915
00:41:15,385 --> 00:41:17,300
And I loved him so much.

916
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:20,260
I know the pain.

917
00:41:22,088 --> 00:41:23,655
It's not an excuse
to hurt people

918
00:41:23,698 --> 00:41:25,526
just because you want him back.

919
00:41:28,573 --> 00:41:31,401
- Maybe you didn't love him
as much as you think,

920
00:41:31,445 --> 00:41:34,317
because you don't understand.

921
00:41:35,623 --> 00:41:36,929
I have work to do.

922
00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:43,718
- You see
what you're up against.

923
00:41:43,762 --> 00:41:45,894
Fillory can never be free

924
00:41:45,938 --> 00:41:49,289
so long as the Dark King
reigns.

925
00:41:49,332 --> 00:41:51,726
- One thing I'm confused about.

926
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:53,685
Where do you fit in
to all of this?

927
00:41:53,728 --> 00:41:56,992
- Well, Rupert recognized me.

928
00:41:57,036 --> 00:41:58,951
Oh, he's always disliked me.

929
00:41:58,994 --> 00:42:02,389
He's the one who cursed me
with the Tongue Twisters.

930
00:42:02,432 --> 00:42:04,739
No, I shall find
no happiness in Fillory

931
00:42:04,783 --> 00:42:05,958
so long as he's around.

932
00:42:06,001 --> 00:42:08,438
- So after you leave here,
what?

933
00:42:08,482 --> 00:42:10,049
Just gonna hit the streets?

934
00:42:10,092 --> 00:42:11,833
- Oh, hardly.

935
00:42:11,877 --> 00:42:14,401
I shall write.

936
00:42:14,444 --> 00:42:19,841
The things I have seen,
the stories I can tell.

937
00:42:19,885 --> 00:42:22,409
- His stories are very good.

938
00:42:22,452 --> 00:42:24,019
- Just not exactly
kid-appropriate.

939
00:42:26,718 --> 00:42:29,634
Oh, oh, oh, vexing.

940
00:42:29,677 --> 00:42:32,375
Oh, flattery flophouse.

941
00:42:33,986 --> 00:42:35,944
- Did you really
have to do that?

942
00:42:35,988 --> 00:42:37,772
He seemed like such a nice--

943
00:42:37,816 --> 00:42:38,773
- Pedophile?

944
00:42:38,817 --> 00:42:39,818
He's grooming you, Fen,

945
00:42:39,861 --> 00:42:41,080
because you act like you're 12.

946
00:42:41,123 --> 00:42:43,038
- Oh, Gods.

947
00:42:43,082 --> 00:42:45,998
- Remember, make sure to lock
on the right vibration.

948
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:52,439
- Can you feel it?

949
00:42:52,482 --> 00:42:54,920
- Mm, it feels like home.

950
00:42:58,663 --> 00:42:59,664
- Here we go.

951
00:43:04,451 --> 00:43:06,932
Hi.

952
00:43:06,975 --> 00:43:09,761
- I think--I think--
I think we did it.

953
00:43:09,804 --> 00:43:11,632
Should I let go of your ha--

954
00:43:15,114 --> 00:43:17,899
- This--did you--

955
00:43:17,943 --> 00:43:21,511
- No, not on purpose.

956
00:43:21,555 --> 00:43:24,471
I do--I'm not sure
I even did this at all.

957
00:43:24,514 --> 00:43:25,733
- Whoa, why do I feel
like I've--

958
00:43:25,777 --> 00:43:27,561
- Been here before.

959
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,824
Because this is it.

960
00:43:29,868 --> 00:43:32,566
This is where the signal
brought us.

961
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,656
Okay, okay,
I'll just travel us out.

962
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,049
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

963
00:43:40,226 --> 00:43:42,010
- Plum.
- It's not working.

964
00:43:43,795 --> 00:43:46,145
We can't leave.
