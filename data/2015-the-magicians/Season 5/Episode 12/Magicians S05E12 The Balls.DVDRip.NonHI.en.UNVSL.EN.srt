1
00:00:01,168 --> 00:00:02,659
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:04,814
<i>- What are we going to do?
- We got to kill the Dark King.</i>

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:09,299
Fillory can never be free so
long as the Dark King reigns.

4
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:11,344
Surprised?

5
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:13,710
You must stop this,
whatever the cost.

6
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:16,545
Well, the cost is blowing
up the entire planet.

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,811
Which is... A decent option?

8
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:20,013
So you're saying
we can use the Ark,

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,522
rescue the people, blow up
Fillory and stop the Dark King?

10
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,922
Do these fiends...

11
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:28,655
Do they succeed in stealing the
people and building a new world for them?

12
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:30,391
I made no mention
of a new world.

13
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:35,731
It is you. You and your
friends are the invading force.

14
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:39,204
What about the World Seed?
From Q's page? If we could find it,

15
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:42,071
we could use it to build a
new world. A new Fillory.

16
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:43,871
We're looking for the Couple.

17
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:45,503
If it was anything else.

18
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:46,945
But they have something we need.

19
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,413
The World Seed.

20
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:50,950
The most valuable
object in the multiverse.

21
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,145
Which is why I
wanted to steal it.

22
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:56,554
We spent months constructing a
map. We called it our Heist Book.

23
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:57,784
Here.

24
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,369
<i>Is that Gavin from the Library?</i>

25
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:00,393
What happened to you?

26
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:02,554
Marina hired me
to rob the Couple.

27
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:04,928
She didn't tell us that
the plan was suicidal

28
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:06,728
<i>without the Harmonic
Convergence.</i>

29
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,259
<i>You twats stopped the Convergence.
There wasn't enough magic.</i>

30
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,861
Marina sent us in anyway.

31
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,169
Give me the page.

32
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:19,775
Okay, you win. It's yours.

33
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:24,283
Bottling our
emotions, literally.

34
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,619
This must be what undergoing
the Vulcan ritual of Kalanaur is like.

35
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:30,816
I like your sweater.

36
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,358
Are you saying that to be cruel?

37
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,554
No, I saw no
reason not to share.

38
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,698
I planned my whole
outfit around that bottle!

39
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:43,809
Ow.

40
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,531
God, shut up.

41
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:49,375
What's happening to you

42
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:52,413
looks just like what
happened to my mom.

43
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:55,907
The episodes didn't stop when
I was born. They got worse.

44
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:57,542
The Circumstances control panel?

45
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:00,452
We figured if the Couple is
going to use the World Seed,

46
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:04,321
they need clean magic, So,
without this, they are stuck.

47
00:02:04,424 --> 00:02:05,969
<i>The Couple just got
the last thing they need.</i>

48
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:08,258
They have the Seed,
the page and the Panel.

49
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,424
We gotta tell the others. They
need to steal that Seed now.

50
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:15,301
Okay, guys. This
is a horrible story.

51
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:17,803
I really hate telling it, and
I'm only going to say it once.

52
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,835
The Nave Hotel...

53
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:27,609
<i>Current home of the
Couple for two reasons.</i>

54
00:02:28,015 --> 00:02:29,608
One, the house rules.

55
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,184
<i>Per a jamming spell, you
can't do any battle magic.</i>

56
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,149
Wards prevent traveling in
and out, cell phones don't work,

57
00:02:36,223 --> 00:02:37,967
<i>and if you're caught
with any kind of weapon,</i>

58
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,586
<i>or engage in any
sort of physical beef</i>

59
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:44,598
or try to scam the hotel or
any of its guests, bye-bye.

60
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:49,061
Idea being, The Nave is the magical
world's number-one safe space,

61
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:52,634
<i>which is strictly
enforced by the Bellhops.</i>

62
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:56,074
Arguing is allowed.
Physical altercation is not.

63
00:02:56,476 --> 00:03:00,174
<i>The creepy dicks are golems
who've been enchanted to be empaths.</i>

64
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:02,205
Goodbye, ladies.

65
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,010
<i>They have to see you,</i>

66
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:09,012
but if they can and you radiate the
kind of micro-aggressions they sense,

67
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,453
you get the boot... Or worse.

68
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:16,227
<i>We were up to some major
no good, so we steered clear.</i>

69
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,162
In the basement, reason two
the Couple settled at The Nave.

70
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:22,062
<i>The vault.</i>

71
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:24,404
<i>Famously impenetrable.</i>

72
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:29,070
Except, I thought, vulnerable
during the Harmonic Convergence,

73
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:31,236
which you fucked
into a cocked hat.

74
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:36,083
<i>Hence, the safe
crack was slow going.</i>

75
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:43,020
<i>But punching a hole in the
anti-Traveler wards was right on sched.</i>

76
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:46,883
Meanwhile, I was running
it all from a safe distance.

77
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,896
<i>Or trying to.</i>

78
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:02,099
That place has some killer
protections against magical spyware.

79
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:08,048
<i>Marina? Marina?
Looks like I'm in.</i>

80
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:17,323
Crikey, it is
dick-shrivel cold in here.

81
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:30,069
Long story, unbearable, there
was no World Seed in the vault.

82
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,617
<i>And then, because the
vault took so long to crack</i>

83
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:36,507
<i>without the Harmonic
Convergence,</i>

84
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,412
it all went horribly
pear-shaped.

85
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,451
And we know what that
meant for poor Gavin.

86
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:59,054
So, boosting anything from that hotel
without the Harmonic Convergence?

87
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:00,894
Is a shit show.

88
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,214
What makes you ducklings
think you can do any better?

89
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:05,997
Well, for one thing,
you had bad information.

90
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:10,104
Remind me who in the
Disney princess fuck you are?

91
00:05:10,177 --> 00:05:11,736
She's someone who can read this.

92
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:17,113
It turns out it's a form of
Fillorian used in Ember worship.

93
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,850
I really should've
recognized it.

94
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:22,284
So, according to the page,
the World Seed can only live

95
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:25,189
when the temperature is 99
degrees with 99% humidity.

96
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:26,487
The vault was freezing.

97
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,920
There's no way the Couple
would keep it there. It would die.

98
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:33,863
This is so you guys.
Top info. Too late.

99
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:34,967
Wrong.

100
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,867
'Cause now we know
where the Seed isn't,

101
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,701
so us guys are doing this. Yup.

102
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:53,717
No. JULIA: Look, I
get this is hard, okay?

103
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,153
Julia, No. But we have
to do everything we can

104
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:57,782
in our power to make sure

105
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,738
that our child has a
better mother than you did.

106
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,056
He already does. She might.

107
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,282
If we can find out what
happens to Traveler moms.

108
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,164
And the only one that
we can talk to is yours.

109
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,997
I don't even know
where she is. I do.

110
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:09,788
Connecticut. According
to the locator spell.

111
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,237
Okay, you realize you are
getting more intense every day

112
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,571
and impossible to argue
with, and it is kind of scary.

113
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:17,978
Hormones, dude. Enjoy the ride.

114
00:06:37,264 --> 00:06:38,704
So I lensed the
outside of the hotel,

115
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,294
and this room is 30 degrees
hotter than all the others.

116
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,489
It's got to be where the Couple
has the World Seed stashed.

117
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:49,472
Also, there's someone in there,

118
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:50,771
probably a guard.

119
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:52,175
Brava!

120
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:55,247
But stealing the Seed means
taking it out of that hot house.

121
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:56,995
How do you transport
it without killing it?

122
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,212
Now you tell me. I don't know.

123
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:02,249
But the Couple did.

124
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:04,023
Magnus Dellacorte.

125
00:07:04,724 --> 00:07:06,420
Top Hedge, West Coast.

126
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,487
Best friends, George
and Paloma Ball.

127
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,122
The Balls.

128
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,077
Explains why they
go by the Couple.

129
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,265
Magnus lost two things the
night of his 53rd birthday party.

130
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:21,773
His life, to a coronary,
and the World Seed,

131
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:23,469
both courtesy of the Couple,

132
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:26,478
who aren't such good
friends but badass bandits.

133
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,579
But how did they
get the Seed out?

134
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,743
Five minutes in the
open air and it's dead.

135
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,617
Paloma's wearing couture.

136
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:37,215
Maybe they kept it warm
with their white-hot taste.

137
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:42,752
Except that bag. It's a Birkin
knock-off. And a shit one.

138
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:46,127
Really? Looks kind
of fancy. To you.

139
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:48,092
Which is why you're so adorable.

140
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:50,262
Maybe the bag is homemade?

141
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:52,829
Some kind of...
incubator they cooked up.

142
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,634
To keep the Seed toasty.

143
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:57,109
Good job, class.

144
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:58,338
Hmm.

145
00:07:58,445 --> 00:07:59,469
Couple's suite.

146
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,245
We make sure they
aren't there, we break in,

147
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,513
find the incubator bag,
which'll definitely be on site

148
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:09,077
because Paloma would never
wear it unless it was to steal the Seed.

149
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,352
Might be criminal Tiffany's,
but it's fashion Walmart.

150
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,819
We go to temperature control. We
crank the Seed Room down to freezing.

151
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,160
The guard freaks out. Cell
phones don't work in The Nave,

152
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:20,631
so he has to call the Couple
on a land line, which is dead.

153
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,168
Because I cut it.

154
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:24,294
He goes full pant-shit,
has to find the Couple.

155
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:26,306
Opens the Seed Room door.
- Runs out.

156
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:28,569
We're right there. MARGO:
With the homemade hot pocket,

157
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,371
we drop the Seed in, and jet.

158
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:31,638
The guard'll see you.

159
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,737
Three against one. Bellhops?

160
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:37,716
We pull the fire alarm, blend into
the emotional pandemonium, exit.

161
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:40,650
With a nod to <i>Fantastic
Beasts.</i> One problem.

162
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,315
What's happening in the
basement needs to be timed

163
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,552
to the second with what's
happening in the Seed Room.

164
00:08:45,658 --> 00:08:47,458
Take too long and the
Seed'll freeze to death.

165
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,052
And with all
communications jammed,

166
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:51,654
how is each team supposed
to know what to do and when?

167
00:08:52,065 --> 00:08:53,376
Well, there's the
conductor spell.

168
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,131
Created by a conductor
who was going blind.

169
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,565
So he and his orchestra
could still communicate.

170
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:01,470
Wouldn't all those voices
be kind of confusing?

171
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:05,069
Each musician only hears the
conductor, but never one another.

172
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:08,376
I'm totally sure I don't understand,
and totally sure it's going to work.

173
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,609
Why wouldn't it set off
the hotel protections?

174
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,686
The spell was
designed to help artists,

175
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,414
so by nature, it's innocuous.

176
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:15,721
You'll be the conductor, then?

177
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,022
I would,

178
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,150
but I don't know
the hotel, not like...

179
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:24,530
So, wait, not only are we
breaking into a hotel of horrors,

180
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,197
but our conductor has
to be a psychopath?

181
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:28,801
Sociopath, technically.

182
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,704
And you wrote my
Word As Bond yourself.

183
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:35,367
What happened to that arrogant
self-confidence you're so famous for?

184
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,742
Oops. Right.

185
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:43,781
Look, if you're too scared
to pull your weight...

186
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:47,581
I'm fine. As long as Zelda's
there to keep an eye on you.

187
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:49,388
Okay.

188
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,194
That should adjust
for Circumstances.

189
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,091
Remember, you have
to keep hold of the baton.

190
00:09:58,164 --> 00:09:59,996
If you let go, it
breaks the spell.

191
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,262
Shall we test it?

192
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,768
Okay, kids, get ready
to be my sock puppets.

193
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09,776
What is this sorcery?

194
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:11,937
Woman in my
head, reveal yourself.

195
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:21,159
He must have been
in range of the spell.

196
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:23,985
So I have to run a heist
with a pig in my head?

197
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,319
What the shit with the gun?

198
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:27,587
It is to put in the
hands of a hero

199
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,721
who will do what is
just and necessary.

200
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,095
Which is?

201
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:35,033
Assassinate she who
plots to destroy Fillory.

202
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,330
Julia Wicker.

203
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:37,847
What the hell is wrong with you?

204
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:40,033
Wait, is this thing loaded?
Well, of course it is!

205
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,817
Just... All right, get out. You know
what? How about we cook you?

206
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,085
You hear me, bacon?
- It's hilarious.

207
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:45,772
No, no. Please, people. The
fate of my world is at stake.

208
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:48,314
Gentlemen, please,
control your spinsters.

209
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,113
Give me the gun.

210
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:01,788
Guys? Are you seeing this, too?

211
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:05,059
<i>I can't take another heartache</i>

212
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:06,997
<i>Though you say you're my friend</i>

213
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,326
<i>I'm at my wits' end</i>

214
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,170
<i>You say your love is bona fide</i>

215
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:14,298
<i>But that don't coincide</i>

216
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,533
<i>With the things that you do</i>

217
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:22,446
<i>And when I ask you
to be nice, you say</i>

218
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:25,081
<i>You've gotta be cruel to be kind</i>

219
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,017
<i>In the right measure</i>

220
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:30,523
<i>Cruel to be kind
It's a very good sign</i>

221
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:36,460
<i>Cruel to be kind Means
that I love you, baby</i>

222
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,895
<i>You've gotta be cruel</i>

223
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:40,831
<i>You've gotta be cruel to be kind</i>

224
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:50,537
<i>Well, I do my best
to understand, dear</i>

225
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,373
<i>But you still mystify</i>

226
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,845
<i>And I want to know why</i>

227
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:57,717
<i>I pick myself up off the ground</i>

228
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:00,377
<i>To have you knock me back down</i>

229
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:02,855
<i>Again and again</i>

230
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:07,926
<i>And when I ask you
to explain, you say</i>

231
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,958
<i>You've gotta be cruel to be kind</i>

232
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,896
<i>In the right measure</i>

233
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:16,198
<i>Cruel to be kind
It's a very good sign</i>

234
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,194
<i>Cruel to be kind</i>

235
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:21,901
<i>Means that I love you, baby</i>

236
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:23,841
<i>You've gotta be cruel</i>

237
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,505
<i>You've gotta be cruel to be kind</i>

238
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:40,382
<i>Baby</i>

239
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,692
You see? This is why I don't
hang out with you people.

240
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,602
But on the bright side,
we were pitch-perfect.

241
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:02,512
I will kill Julia. You have my
solemn word as a devout Catholic.

242
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,982
A hero has risen.

243
00:13:05,084 --> 00:13:07,315
With a most excellent
singing voice.

244
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,420
Huh.

245
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:09,956
Well, we'll karaoke in Fillory.

246
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:12,167
Because it's definitely
not getting destroyed.

247
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,893
I think I speak for the group

248
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:21,491
in wondering why the fuck
did we all just chorus line?

249
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:24,264
Yeah, and I heard all of you
in my head, not just Marina.

250
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:25,748
Yeah. What the hell? KADY:
What in the world was that?

251
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:27,502
Our Circumstances are unstable.

252
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,138
Our collective surge of emotion

253
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,803
must have broken down
some of the spell's barriers.

254
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:35,147
And as for the singing, well, it
was designed by a conductor,

255
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:38,116
and music is the purest
manifestation of feeling.

256
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,380
So let me get this straight.

257
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,456
Every time we have a feeling,
we're gonna go full-on <i>Glee?</i>

258
00:13:43,523 --> 00:13:46,823
That doesn't seem ideal
for, you know, a heist.

259
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:49,555
Wait, do you guys remember
when we were learning battle magic?

260
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,528
If the spell's gonna make us break out
into song every time we get worked up,

261
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:55,568
why don't we
emotion-bottle ourselves?

262
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:57,227
'Cause that went
so well the last time.

263
00:13:57,337 --> 00:13:58,361
No, no, that's good.

264
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:01,204
Might also help avoid
Bellhop detection.

265
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:02,866
No emotions for them to sense.

266
00:14:04,043 --> 00:14:06,535
So repress the
overwhelming urge to sing

267
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:08,012
while stealing shit.

268
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,373
It's eight grade all over again.

269
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:17,951
Um, hi, I'm looking
for a patient.

270
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:20,384
Name? Neela Adiyodi.

271
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,660
Oh. There must be some mistake.

272
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,062
I'm Neela Adiyodi.

273
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,496
I spent my whole life thinking
my mom was a basket case.

274
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:32,003
You're telling me she's fine.

275
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:36,874
She was fine with me. We
need to see how she is with you.

276
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:44,812
Look,

277
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:48,586
I won't pretend I can even
imagine what this is like for you.

278
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,724
But you won't be alone.

279
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:09,860
We're in.

280
00:16:10,236 --> 00:16:13,764
Marina, you copy?
Loud and clear.

281
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,968
How you guys feeling? We're not.

282
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:18,868
Pete,

283
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,440
you're up. Oh.

284
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:29,687
Look, everyone in the
know knows about you guys.

285
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,857
And what exactly do they know?

286
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,087
The best is barely good enough.

287
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:40,793
That's what I deal in. Art,
spells, totems, best of the best.

288
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,498
You've got six minutes.

289
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:44,997
It's too bad.

290
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:48,006
I just ordered a bottle
of 2005 Haut-Brion

291
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:50,372
that will take at least
half an hour to decant.

292
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,441
Thirty-six minutes, then.

293
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,212
This the one?

294
00:17:36,188 --> 00:17:37,747
That's...

295
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,559
Very moist.

296
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,160
Guys?

297
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:46,898
The Couple's been translating
the World Seed page.

298
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:48,934
But wrong.

299
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:50,629
Grab it.

300
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,802
And we're Fogg-ed.

301
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:01,707
<i>Guys? What is going on?</i>

302
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:19,829
Should I wait here
for you guys, or...

303
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:23,461
Sir, there's a problem.

304
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,897
Is that my suitcase?

305
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:29,131
You told the Couple that this
is a bottle of 2005 Haut-Brion,

306
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:31,073
when in fact it's
Two Buck Chuck.

307
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,903
That constitutes deceit, a
violation of hotel protocol.

308
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:36,574
You'll be checking
out immediately.

309
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:46,559
Abort. Fogg 17 showed
up. He's got Team Incubator.

310
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,754
That's catastrophic.

311
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:50,626
We should rescue them. Yup.

312
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:17,854
Hello.

313
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,930
Management has been alerted to
the presence of unauthorized guests.

314
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,191
Oh. Please present
your key cards.

315
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:27,766
We are late, sorry.

316
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:41,513
Hello? Jesus, Alice. What's
going on? Answer me.

317
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,615
<i>Eliot? Kady?</i>

318
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,016
Get off of him. Get off of him!

319
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:51,020
<i>I wish I was smarter</i>

320
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:57,194
<i>I got so lost on the shore</i>

321
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:04,266
<i>I wish I was taller</i>

322
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:10,571
<i>Things really matter to me</i>

323
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:17,348
<i>And I'm still so afraid</i>

324
00:20:18,084 --> 00:20:24,285
<i>Yes, I'm still so afraid</i>

325
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,756
<i>On my own</i>

326
00:20:28,194 --> 00:20:29,856
That was interesting.

327
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:31,895
Empath overload.

328
00:20:33,132 --> 00:20:34,532
I doubt it will last.

329
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:37,393
Alice? Let's go.

330
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,666
Okay. Guess Alice
had a little moment.

331
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,937
<i>Get your shit together, people.</i>

332
00:20:46,145 --> 00:20:47,145
Ah.

333
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,904
What do we have here?

334
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,276
Ah, Christ. You brought the gun.

335
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,451
Strong choice. Thanks.

336
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:06,590
Thank you, Henry.
George, my pleasure.

337
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:09,100
On our new world, you
can have your own island.

338
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:12,501
No, I want my own
goddamn country.

339
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:14,168
Fine.

340
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,502
There won't be a new world.

341
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:16,701
Really?

342
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,904
Your translation of
the page is wrong.

343
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:22,347
You're going to end up killing
the Seed. How would you know?

344
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:24,644
Smart girl. Keep going.

345
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,914
I'm Fillorian. I can
translate the page correctly.

346
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:32,891
I'll even help you grow the
Seed, if you spare my friends.

347
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:36,292
I'm so sorry. I can't
control it. I'm sorry.

348
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,826
Your weaponized
emotional baggage

349
00:21:38,931 --> 00:21:40,900
turned out to be a
weirdly good thing.

350
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,594
<i>So, Fen pulled a stall.</i>

351
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:44,830
She's headed to the Seed
Room with the Couple.

352
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:47,099
Josh and Margo are still
in their suite with Fogg.

353
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:48,505
<i>Can you get them free?</i>

354
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:52,001
Kady, if you can take out Fogg
alone, I think I can help Alice.

355
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:55,774
Good luck.

356
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:04,955
Alice. Do you trust me?

357
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:09,792
- What are you doing?
- Just a little sip.

358
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,328
To the confusion of our enemies.

359
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:27,775
Alice, whatever it is,
whatever you're feeling,

360
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:30,311
you can just tell me.

361
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:36,886
I just can't stop thinking
about what he did to me.

362
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:44,693
So... So useless. So stupid.

363
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:54,234
<i>In this proud land
we grew up strong</i>

364
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:57,908
<i>We were wanted all along</i>

365
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:03,242
<i>I was taught to
fight Taught to win</i>

366
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:07,712
<i>I never thought I could fail</i>

367
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:16,056
<i>Don't give up 'Cause
you have friends</i>

368
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:25,538
<i>Don't give up
You're not beaten yet</i>

369
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:31,042
<i>Don't give up</i>

370
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:35,377
<i>I know you can make it good</i>

371
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,384
<i>Though I saw it all around</i>

372
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:43,284
<i>Never thought that
I could be affected</i>

373
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,582
<i>Thought that we'd be last to go</i>

374
00:23:48,127 --> 00:23:52,087
<i>It is so strange
the way things turn</i>

375
00:23:57,403 --> 00:24:03,673
<i>Rest your head
You worry too much</i>

376
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:07,804
<i>It's going to be all right</i>

377
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:14,447
<i>When times get rough</i>

378
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,757
<i>You can fall back on us</i>

379
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:26,122
<i>Don't give up
Please don't give up</i>

380
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:32,238
<i>Got to walk out of here</i>

381
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:36,535
<i>I can't take any more</i>

382
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:41,139
<i>Gonna stand on that bridge</i>

383
00:24:41,714 --> 00:24:45,515
<i>Keep my eyes down below</i>

384
00:24:46,452 --> 00:24:49,854
<i>Whatever may come</i>

385
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:54,252
<i>And whatever may go</i>

386
00:24:54,827 --> 00:24:57,456
<i>That river's flowing</i>

387
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:01,657
<i>That river's flowing</i>

388
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:11,573
<i>Don't give up 'Cause
you have friends</i>

389
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:20,585
<i>Don't give up You're
not the only one</i>

390
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:26,183
<i>Don't give up</i>

391
00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:30,827
<i>No reason to be ashamed</i>

392
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:35,058
<i>Don't give up</i>

393
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:37,193
<i>You still have us</i>

394
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:44,309
<i>Don't give up now</i>

395
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:47,540
<i>We're proud of who you are</i>

396
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:52,548
<i>Don't give up</i>

397
00:25:52,618 --> 00:25:57,613
<i>You know it's never been easy</i>

398
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:01,187
<i>Don't give up</i>

399
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:05,925
<i>'Cause I believe there's a place</i>

400
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:10,902
<i>There's a place where we belong</i>

401
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:13,964
No!

402
00:26:15,107 --> 00:26:16,507
It's bad enough I have to sing.

403
00:26:20,646 --> 00:26:24,708
First thing you have to do is explain
why you want to build a new world.

404
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:26,708
To you? To the Seed.

405
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:28,515
It's alive, and
in order to grow,

406
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,783
it needs to know exactly
what you want and why.

407
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,619
The Seed will know if you
lie and will refuse to grow.

408
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:45,226
We've made powerful
enemies here on Earth.

409
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:48,634
And one cursed us,

410
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:52,010
making us... Unable
to have children.

411
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:58,107
But on a new world beyond
the reach of our enemies,

412
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:00,985
we hope to have a family.

413
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:05,621
Uh, okay. I have to admit, that's
not a motive I could've guessed.

414
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:08,990
But do you really think
you'd make the best parents?

415
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,301
Hi, Mom.

416
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:28,646
William?

417
00:27:33,352 --> 00:27:34,877
You're going to be a father.

418
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:39,488
That's... That's wonderful.

419
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:41,190
It's why I'm here.

420
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:47,032
I need to know, um,
everything you went through.

421
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:52,300
When did you start
hearing voices?

422
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,540
About three months
into the pregnancy.

423
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:07,217
At first, they thought it
was a chemical imbalance

424
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,519
but after you were born,
I started to get worse.

425
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:15,460
They said the stress
of parenting brought on

426
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,621
a latent psychological disorder,

427
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,460
probably one I'd inherited.

428
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:25,937
The first time I had
to send you away...

429
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:34,673
I hear myself say that and
I still can't believe I did it.

430
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:38,183
I'm so sorry. Mom, I'm okay.

431
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:43,245
I need you to tell me
everything you can.

432
00:28:45,057 --> 00:28:46,685
The voices went
away when you did.

433
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:48,556
And when you came
back, so did they.

434
00:28:50,696 --> 00:28:51,857
Every time you came back,

435
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,899
there was less and
less of a little boy.

436
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:55,264
Mom, this isn't about me.

437
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:58,132
I wanted so much to raise you,

438
00:28:58,237 --> 00:28:59,899
love you, protect you.

439
00:29:01,974 --> 00:29:04,534
But what you needed
protection from was me.

440
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:10,108
What?

441
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,150
Mom?

442
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,221
Uh, I'm sorry,
someone's calling me.

443
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:17,688
What is it? What do you need?

444
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:20,616
Mom, there's no one calling you.

445
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,561
Of course there is. It
must be one of my patients.

446
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:28,731
There's more of them.

447
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,132
You don't hear them?
They're screaming.

448
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:35,301
I don't.

449
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:38,903
Oh, no. No.

450
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:42,607
No, no, not again. Please, stop.

451
00:29:42,714 --> 00:29:45,912
<i>You need to hurry it
up, Kady. Just be careful.</i>

452
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:51,617
Guys? It's Kady.
We have a problem.

453
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:01,966
Let me guess. Camouflage potion?

454
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:06,997
Liquid explosive? Ah.
Good old chloroform, hmm?

455
00:30:08,774 --> 00:30:10,174
Huh.

456
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:12,535
Goddamn Scotch.

457
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:18,273
But not just any Scotch.
Isabella Islay's Single Malt.

458
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:21,513
God damn it. Who
knew you had taste?

459
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:25,082
Wait, no, I need that.
Are you a drunk now?

460
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,760
Well, congratulations. Let me
help you get back on the wagon.

461
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:36,494
Now, why don't you
save us all some trouble

462
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:38,895
and tell me where the
rest of your colleagues are.

463
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:46,337
God damn it. What
did you put in this?

464
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:50,341
A pharmaceutical I bought
off a very helpful bartender.

465
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,948
Street name, Archie.

466
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,649
What just happened?

467
00:30:59,424 --> 00:31:01,655
I just sent him on a
trip to the Etheric Realm.

468
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,688
Where rules prevent
Henry Fogg from leaving.

469
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,265
Here's hoping they're too
high to notice there's a new one.

470
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:11,194
Nice work. Okay,
Alice and Eliot?

471
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:13,238
<i>If you're done with the singing.</i>

472
00:31:15,607 --> 00:31:17,132
You sure you're okay? No.

473
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:19,337
But I can do this.

474
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,579
<i>Great. Now, everything's fine,</i>

475
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:25,442
but medium-sized
bump in the road.

476
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:29,848
Pete just called from a
cell phone outside the hotel.

477
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:34,859
He got caught doing a very
Pete scam, and they booted him.

478
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:36,861
The suitcase? Went with him.

479
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,161
There goes our escape route.

480
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,693
I'm almost annoyed.

481
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:48,470
I might have an idea.

482
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:57,915
Open the window.

483
00:32:11,196 --> 00:32:12,562
Let's hope that works.

484
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:26,283
Well, that was a disaster.

485
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:27,971
Let's go before I
check myself in here.

486
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,513
Hang on, look.

487
00:32:30,582 --> 00:32:33,211
When she's alone,
everything's normal. But...

488
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:34,285
But when you show up...

489
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,256
My Traveler shit doesn't
work, and I still mess her up?

490
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,657
Functional or not,
you're still you.

491
00:32:44,763 --> 00:32:45,924
So it's...

492
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:48,885
It's gonna be the same
for you and the baby?

493
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:53,263
Unless we figure out what it is

494
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:55,603
and find a way to cut it.

495
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:04,104
Okay, Alice and Eliot are
en route to the basement.

496
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,285
Kady, Josh, Margo,
get ready to move.

497
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:08,852
Standing by, Marina.

498
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:15,398
If it's the pig again,
we're having pork chops.

499
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,731
- You gotta be shitting me.
- I beg your pardon?

500
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,995
Oh, hey, babe. What are
you... What are you doing here?

501
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:29,974
I knew it. Knew what?

502
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:32,434
I put a locator spell
on the Heist Book.

503
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:36,107
And since you've been MIA for
two days, I figured I'd find you with it

504
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:39,743
doing exactly what you
promised you'd never do again.

505
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,980
Look, babe, it's not
what it looks like.

506
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:46,856
I mean, it is, but...
God, I'm an idiot.

507
00:33:46,925 --> 00:33:48,826
Listen, babe, people's
lives are on the line.

508
00:33:48,894 --> 00:33:50,863
You're doing that thing
where you call me babe

509
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:51,929
a bunch of times... Yeah.

510
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,499
Which is exactly how I
know that you're lying.

511
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:57,001
Okay, this is not the time.
And it's also not about you.

512
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:58,127
So...

513
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:04,169
The fuck did you just do?

514
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:08,402
Marina, do you copy?
Are we good to go?

515
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:11,908
She's offline.

516
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:15,487
Fair to say, "Act out"?

517
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,817
I know you mean well, Julia,
but I really can't talk right now.

518
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:23,586
Look, can I just show
you something, please?

519
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,061
Where'd you get this?

520
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:34,935
You see that cord
thing between you?

521
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,508
What's going on?

522
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:44,910
You're not crazy, Neela.

523
00:34:47,986 --> 00:34:49,284
Look, magic is real.

524
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:53,425
I'm a Magician.
And so is your son.

525
00:34:53,525 --> 00:34:58,623
But he's a rare breed with this
link that they have to their mothers.

526
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:01,229
Every time they're close by,

527
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:03,894
their abilities start to
bleed over. Stop, stop, stop.

528
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:06,530
Just stop.

529
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:10,902
My baby has the
same abilities as Penny,

530
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,774
which means it causes
the same problems.

531
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:14,710
Oh, this isn't happening.

532
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:17,581
This is happening.

533
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:19,841
Look, I swear. I
know I'm asking a lot,

534
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,996
but if you could just take a
chance and let me help you,

535
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,249
you could have your son back.

536
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:25,950
You'd get to know
your grandchild.

537
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,022
Wouldn't that be worth it?

538
00:35:34,733 --> 00:35:35,860
I can't.

539
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:42,271
I can't go through
this again. It'll kill me.

540
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,038
<i>Tell William I'm sorry.</i>

541
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,789
How many times do I have to
tell you? The heist is not for me.

542
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,483
Right, and you're not
fucking the sexy Librarian.

543
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:03,186
Her? Don't be ridiculous.

544
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:05,627
Oh, my, no. But thank you.

545
00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:07,996
How can I believe
anything that you say?

546
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:10,501
It took a fucking
spell for you to care

547
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:12,764
about anyone other
than yourself. I do care.

548
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:16,001
But I'm also pretty done
bending over backwards for you.

549
00:36:16,074 --> 00:36:19,476
So you either get on board with the
"me" who's me, or you can fuck off.

550
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,012
Good. Thanks.

551
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,315
Uh, I finally know
where we stand.

552
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:40,162
Are... Are you all right?
Fix the goddamn baton.

553
00:36:44,002 --> 00:36:46,631
Look, I know this was
maybe worse than you thought,

554
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:50,836
but now we've got a
shot at fixing it. Yeah.

555
00:36:52,243 --> 00:36:55,839
Penny, she asked me
to give you something.

556
00:37:31,216 --> 00:37:33,208
Don't turn down the
temperature without Marina,

557
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:34,718
if the others
aren't ready, it'll...

558
00:37:34,786 --> 00:37:36,220
Kill the Seed. I know. Mmm-hmm.

559
00:37:36,855 --> 00:37:38,966
But it wouldn't hurt to
find the right control...

560
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,134
Step away from
the equipment, sir.

561
00:37:40,158 --> 00:37:44,095
Oh, my. This is bad.

562
00:37:44,896 --> 00:37:46,387
Jesus, Eliot, what now?

563
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:49,593
Hello, Marina. Glad
you're back with us.

564
00:37:49,701 --> 00:37:52,762
I just need to take
care of this Bellhop.

565
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:55,773
Did you lower the
temperature? Eliot?

566
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:03,479
<i>Twenty-twenty-twenty

600
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,441
George.

601
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:50,848
I love your blades.

602
00:39:52,824 --> 00:39:55,089
You're a strange
girl. Thank you.

603
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:59,056
If you don't give us the
correct translation soon,

604
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:02,065
you'll be a strange,
fingerless girl.

605
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:09,106
Paloma.

606
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:25,287
You do that, the Bellhops
will just rip you to shreds.

607
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:29,192
Yeah, no. We kind of
found their Kryptonite.

608
00:40:29,961 --> 00:40:33,056
Well, I'm fine
slitting her throat.

609
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:34,258
Yeah, me, too.

610
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:35,731
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

611
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,293
Everybody just calm down, okay?

612
00:40:39,404 --> 00:40:43,034
Nobody needs to
die. Except the Seed,

613
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,099
if we keep standing
around talking.

614
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:47,269
See, our friends
cranked the AC in here.

615
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:49,506
So unless you
wanna kill the Seed,

616
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:53,676
back off, and let us
put it in the bag, stat.

617
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,056
Oh, Christ.

618
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,289
Well, now we've
all got a problem.

619
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:14,338
Guys, hey. Let's not
die. Or kill the Seed.

620
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:19,770
Kady, Ball, drop your knives.

621
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,880
Phew.

622
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:30,283
Now, I think I
have a fair solution.

623
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:34,323
Hands. Come on.

624
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,030
Oh!

625
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,661
I got the Seed.
Swallow, sunshine.

626
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,942
We need to call an ambulance.

627
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:47,804
The Seed.

628
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,509
It's fine.

629
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,506
But where the hell
is the Seed, Fen?

630
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:56,741
I've fucking got it, Margo!

631
00:41:57,215 --> 00:41:59,810
Guys, Alice has an
exit. Get to the roof.

632
00:42:00,118 --> 00:42:01,347
Come on, let's go!

633
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:09,919
<i>Ba ba baba Baba ba baba</i>

634
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:12,691
<i>I wanna be sedated</i>

635
00:42:12,764 --> 00:42:15,825
<i>Ba ba baba Baba ba baba</i>

636
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:20,361
<i>I wanna be sedated</i>

637
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:25,421
Bellhops figured out
earplugs. We gotta move.

638
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,674
Fen, where the fuck is the Seed?

639
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:29,543
And why are you
running so weird?

640
00:42:29,614 --> 00:42:34,609
The Seed is somewhere
warm. Very humid. Even moist.

641
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,920
Oh, whoa! Uh...

642
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:38,232
Come on. JOSH: We
got to get out of here.

643
00:42:38,256 --> 00:42:39,417
Here, in here.

644
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,421
So what's the escape plan?

645
00:42:43,528 --> 00:42:45,554
It's more of an escape plea.

646
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:07,044
Ho ho ho, motherfuckers!

647
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:17,050
<i>Cruel to be kind
in the right measure</i>

648
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:20,459
<i>Cruel to be kind,
it's a very good sign</i>

649
00:43:20,898 --> 00:43:22,366
<i>Cruel to be kind</i>

650
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:26,234
<i>Means that I love you, baby</i>

651
00:43:26,304 --> 00:43:28,830
<i>You've gotta be cruel to be kind</i>
