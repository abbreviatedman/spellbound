JOSH: <i>What are we going to do?</i>
MARGO: <i>We got to kill the Dark King.</i>

3
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:09,299
Fillory can never be free so
long as the Dark King reigns.

4
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:11,344
Surprised?

5
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:13,710
You must stop this,
whatever the cost.

6
00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:16,545
Well, the cost is blowing
up the entire planet.

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:17,811
Which is... A decent option?

8
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:20,013
So you're saying
we can use the Ark,

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:23,522
rescue the people, blow up
Fillory and stop the Dark King?

10
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,922
JULIA: Do these fiends...

11
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:28,655
Do they succeed in stealing the
people and building a new world for them?

12
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:30,391
I made no mention
of a new world.

13
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:35,731
It is you. You and your
friends are the invading force.

14
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:39,204
What about the World Seed?
From Q's page? If we could find it,

15
00:00:39,306 --> 00:00:42,071
we could use it to build a
new world. A new Fillory.

16
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:43,871
We're looking for the Couple.

17
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:45,503
If it was anything else.

18
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:46,945
But they have something we need.

19
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:48,413
The World Seed.

20
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:50,950

object in the multiverse.

21
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,145
Which is why I
wanted to steal it.

22

to rob the Couple.

27

the plan was suicidal

00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,861

going to use the World Seed,

So, according to the page,
the World Seed can only live

when the temperature is 99
degrees with 99% humidity.

would keep it there. It would die.

It's got to be where the Couple

146
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,579
But how did they
get the Seed out?

147
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,743
Five minutes in the
open air and it's dead.

148
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,617
Paloma's wearing couture.

149
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:37,215
Maybe they kept it warm
with their white-hot taste.

they aren't there, we break in,

00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,513
find the incubator bag,
which'll definitely be on site

161
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:09,077
because Paloma would never
wear it unless it was to steal the Seed.

162
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,352
Might be criminal Tiffany's,
but it's fashion Walmart.

163
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,819
We go to temperature control. We
crank the Seed Room down to freezing.

164
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:18,160
The guard freaks out. Cell
phones don't work in The Nave,

00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:20,631
so he has to call the Couple
on a land line, which is dead.

00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,168
Because I cut it.

167

He goes full pant-shit,
has to find the Couple.

Opens the Seed Room
door. JOSH: Runs out.

We're right there. MARGO:
With the homemade hot pocket,

00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,371
we drop the Seed in, and jet.
