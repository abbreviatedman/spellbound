1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,657
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:07,658 --> 00:00:09,829
- What are we going to do?
- We gotta kill the Dark King.

3
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:14,348
Fillory can never be free so
long as the Dark King reigns.

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,391
Surprised?

5
00:00:16,392 --> 00:00:18,733
You must stop this, whatever the cost.

6
00:00:18,734 --> 00:00:21,646
Well, the cost is blowing
up the entire planet,

7
00:00:21,647 --> 00:00:22,814
- which is...
- A decent option?

8
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:26,067
So you're saying we can use
the Ark, rescue the people,

9
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:28,528
blow up Fillory, and stop the Dark King?

10
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:32,382
Do these fiends, do they succeed
in stealing the people

11
00:00:32,383 --> 00:00:33,701
and building a new world for them?

12
00:00:33,702 --> 00:00:35,411
I made no mention of a new world.

13
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,059
It is you.

14
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:40,748
You and your friends
are the invading force.

15
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:43,334
What about the World Seed from Q's page?

16
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:45,920
If we could find it, we could
use it to build a new world,

17
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:47,039
a new Fillory.

18
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,881
We're looking for The Couple.

19
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,592
If it was anything else...

20
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:52,052
They have something we need.

21
00:00:52,053 --> 00:00:53,511
The World Seed,

22
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:55,972
the most valuable object
in the multiverse,

23
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:58,141
which is why I wanted to steal it.

24
00:00:58,142 --> 00:01:00,059
We spent months constructing a map.

25
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,539
We called it our heist book.

26
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,889
Here.

27
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,394
Is that Gavin from the Library?

28
00:01:04,395 --> 00:01:07,650
- What happened to you?
- Marina hired me to rob The Couple.

29
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:10,029
She didn't tell us that
the plan was suicidal

30
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,750
without the Harmonic Convergence.

31
00:01:11,754 --> 00:01:13,769
You twats stopped the convergence,

32
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,309
there wasn't enough magic,

33
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:16,868
Marina sent us in anyway.

34
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,199
Give me the page.

35
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,458
Okay, you win.

36
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:25,672
Oh, it's yours. It's yours.

37
00:01:25,673 --> 00:01:28,203
Bottling our emotions.

38
00:01:28,204 --> 00:01:29,589
Literally.

39
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,779
This must be what undergoing

40
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:34,677
the Vulcan Ritual of Kolinahr is like.

41
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:35,887
I like your sweater.

42
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:37,848
- Are you saying that to be cruel?
- No.

43
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:39,933
I saw no reason not to share.

44
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,769
I based my whole outfit
around that bottle!

45
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,392
Ow.

46
00:01:49,393 --> 00:01:51,944
God, shut up.

47
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,447
What's happening to you

48
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:57,533
looks just like what happened to my mom.

49
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,869
And the episodes didn't
stop when I was born.

50
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,953
They got worse.

51
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,609
The Circumstances Control Panel?

52
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,469
I figured if The Couple is
going to use the World Seed,

53
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:09,420
they need clean magic, so
without this, they are stuck.

54
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:10,963
The Couple just got the
last thing they need.

55
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,579
They have the seed,
the page, and the panel.

56
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,599
We got to tell the others.

57
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,720
They need to steal that seed now.

58
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:20,056
Okay, guys, this is a horrible story.

59
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:22,850
I really hate telling it, and
I'm only gonna say it once.

60
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,849
The Nave Hotel.

61
00:02:29,803 --> 00:02:32,872
Current home of The
Couple for two reasons.

62
00:02:32,873 --> 00:02:35,072
One, the house rules.

63
00:02:35,073 --> 00:02:38,442
Per a jamming spell,
you can't do any battle magic,

64
00:02:38,443 --> 00:02:41,139
wards prevent traveling in and
out, cell phones don't work,

65
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,813
and if you're caught
with any kind of weapon

66
00:02:42,814 --> 00:02:45,539
or engage in any sort of physical beef

67
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,399
or try to scam the hotel
or any of its guests...

68
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,339
Bye-bye.

69
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,499
Idea being the Nave

70
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,579
is the magical world's
number one safe space,

71
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,629
which is strictly
enforced by the bellhops.

72
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,846
Arguing is allowed.

73
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,293
Physical altercation is not.

74
00:03:01,294 --> 00:03:03,002
The creepy dicks are golems

75
00:03:03,003 --> 00:03:05,672
who've been enchanted to be empaths.

76
00:03:05,673 --> 00:03:07,271
Good-bye, ladies.

77
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:09,949
They have to see you.

78
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,279
But if they can

79
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,560
and you radiate the kind of
micro-aggressions they sense,

80
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,479
you get the boot.

81
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,913
Or worse.

82
00:03:17,914 --> 00:03:21,319
We were up to some major
no good, so we steered clear.

83
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,310
In the basement, reason two
The Couple settled at the Nave:

84
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,323
the vault.

85
00:03:27,324 --> 00:03:29,499
Famously impenetrable.

86
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,159
Except, I thought, vulnerable

87
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,919
during the Harmonic Convergence

88
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,300
which you fucked into a cocked hat.

89
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:41,820
Hence the safe crack was slow going.

90
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,670
But punching a hole in
the anti-traveler wards

91
00:03:46,674 --> 00:03:48,643
was right on sched.

92
00:03:48,644 --> 00:03:51,774
Meanwhile, I was running it
all from a safe distance.

93
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,366
Or trying to.

94
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,912
That place has some killer protections

95
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:07,340
against magical spyware.

96
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:13,837
Marina, Marina. Looks like I'm in.

97
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:23,060
Whew, crikey, it is
dick-shrivel cold in here.

98
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,589
Long story. Unbearable.

99
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,340
There was no World Seed in the vault.

100
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,739
And then, because the vault

101
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,020
took so long to crack without
the Harmonic Convergence...

102
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,620
It all went horribly pear-shaped.

103
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,679
And we know what that
meant for poor Gavin.

104
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,919
So boosting anything

105
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,599
from that hotel without
the Harmonic Convergence

106
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,879
is a shit show.

107
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,054
What makes you ducklings
think you can do any better?

108
00:05:08,055 --> 00:05:11,061
Well, for one thing,
you had bad information.

109
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,144
Remind me who in the Disney
Princess fuck you are?

110
00:05:15,145 --> 00:05:16,483
She's someone who can read this.

111
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,733
It turns out it's a form of Fillorian

112
00:05:20,734 --> 00:05:22,242
used in ember worship.

113
00:05:22,243 --> 00:05:23,904
I really should have recognized it.

114
00:05:23,905 --> 00:05:27,279
So according to the page,
the World Seed can only live

115
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,285
when the temperature is 99
degrees with 99% humidity.

116
00:05:30,286 --> 00:05:31,379
And the vault was freezing.

117
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,139
There's no way The Couple
would keep it there.

118
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:36,019
- It would die.
- This is so you guys.

119
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,899
Top info.

120
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,963
Too late.

121
00:05:38,964 --> 00:05:41,699
Wrong, 'cause now we know
where the seed isn't.

122
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,870
- So us guys are doing this.
- Yep.

123
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:56,130
- Synced & corrected by<font color="#E83286"> MementMori </font>-
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.addic7ed.com</font> --

124
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,220
No.

125
00:05:57,221 --> 00:05:58,859
Look, I get this is
hard, okay, but we...

126
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,059
- Julia, no.
- ... have to do everything we can

127
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,899
in our power to make sure that

128
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,572
our child has a better
mother than you did.

129
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:07,074
- He already does.
- She might.

130
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,329
If we can find out what
happens to traveler moms.

131
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,027
And the only one that
we can talk to is yours.

132
00:06:11,028 --> 00:06:12,371
I don't even know where she is.

133
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,497
I do. Connecticut,

134
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,859
according to the locator spell.

135
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,719
Okay, you realize that you
are getting more intense

136
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,197
every day and impossible to argue with

137
00:06:19,198 --> 00:06:20,630
and it is kind of scary.

138
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:23,383
Hormones, dude. Enjoy the ride.

139
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,739
_

140
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,649
So I lensed the outside of the hotel,

141
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:47,322
and this room is 30 degrees
hotter than all the others.

142
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:50,202
It's got to be where The Couple
has the World Seed stashed.

143
00:06:50,203 --> 00:06:54,293
Also there's someone in there,

144
00:06:54,294 --> 00:06:55,831
probably a guard.

145
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,219
Brava, but stealing the seed

146
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,130
means taking it out of that hot house.

147
00:07:00,134 --> 00:07:01,969
How do you transport
it without killing it?

148
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:05,299
- Well, you tell me.
- Well, I don't know.

149
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,899
But The Couple did.

150
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,743
- Magnus Dellacorte.
- Top hedge, west coast.

151
00:07:11,744 --> 00:07:15,601
Best friends George and Paloma Ball.

152
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:17,728
The Balls.

153
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,065
Explains why they go by The Couple.

154
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:21,659
Magnus lost two things

155
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,262
the night of his 53rd birthday party.

156
00:07:23,263 --> 00:07:26,821
His life, to a coronary;
and the World Seed,

157
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:28,489
both courtesy of The Couple

158
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,993
who aren't such good friends,
but badass bandits.

159
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:34,620
But how did they get the seed out?

160
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,956
Five minutes in the
open air and it's dead.

161
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,625
Paloma's wearing couture.

162
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:42,249
Maybe they kept it warm
with their white-hot taste.

163
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,588
Except that bag.

164
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:46,465
It's a Birkin knockoff.

165
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,209
And a shit one.

166
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,459
Really? It looks kind of fancy.

167
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,139
To you, which is why you're so adorable.

168
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,199
Maybe the bag is homemade.

169
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,289
- Some kind of...
- Incubator they cooked up.

170
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,639
To keep the seed toasty.

171
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,959
Yeah.

172
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,479
Good job, class.

173
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,963
- Mm-hmm.
- Couple's suite.

174
00:08:04,964 --> 00:08:06,819
We make sure they aren't
there, we break in,

175
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,579
find the incubator bag,

176
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,560
which'll definitely be on-site,

177
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:12,399
because Paloma would never wear it

178
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,115
unless it was to steal the seed.

179
00:08:14,116 --> 00:08:17,599
Might be criminal Tiffany's,
but it's fashion Walmart.

180
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,622
We go to temperature control.

181
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,779
We crank the seed room down to freezing.

182
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,809
The guard freaks out.

183
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,168
Cell phones don't work in the Nave,

184
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,713
so he has to call The Couple on
the landline, which is dead...

185
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,153
Because I cut it.

186
00:08:27,154 --> 00:08:29,383
He goes full pant-shit,
has to find The Couple.

187
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,383
- Opens the seed room door...
- Runs out.

188
00:08:31,384 --> 00:08:33,579
We're right there with
the homemade hot pocket,

189
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,430
we drop the seed in and jet.

190
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:38,017
- Then the guard will see you.
- Three against one.

191
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:40,269
- Bellhops?
- We pull the fire alarm,

192
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,719
blend into the emotional
pandemonium, exit.

193
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,939
With a nod to "Fantastic Beasts."

194
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,943
One problem. What's
happening in the basement

195
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:48,402
needs to be timed

196
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,643
to the second with what's
happening in the seed room.

197
00:08:50,644 --> 00:08:52,531
Take too long and the seed
will freeze to death.

198
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,075
And with all communications jammed,

199
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:56,744
how's each team supposed to
know what to do and when?

200
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:58,412
Well, there's the conductor spell.

201
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:01,239
Created by a conductor
who was going blind.

202
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,660
So he and his orchestra
could still communicate.

203
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,545
Wouldn't all those voices
be kind of confusing?

204
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,863
Each musician only hears the conductor,

205
00:09:08,864 --> 00:09:10,163
but never one another.

206
00:09:10,164 --> 00:09:11,719
I'm totally sure I don't understand

207
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,469
and totally sure it's going to work.

208
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,721
Why wouldn't it set off
the hotel protections?

209
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,599
The spell was designed to help artists,

210
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,469
so by nature, it's innocuous.

211
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,727
You'll be the conductor then?

212
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:24,700
I would, but I don't know
the hotel, not like...

213
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:29,459
So wait, not only are we breaking
into a hotel of horrors,

214
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,238
but our conductor has
to be a psychopath?

215
00:09:31,239 --> 00:09:34,399
Sociopath, technically.

216
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,784
And you wrote my word as bond yourself.

217
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:39,062
What happened to that
arrogant self-confidence

218
00:09:39,063 --> 00:09:40,455
you're so famous for?

219
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,793
Oops. Right.

220
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,838
Look, if you're too scared
to pull your weight...

221
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,242
I'm fine.

222
00:09:50,243 --> 00:09:53,092
As long as Zelda's there
to keep an eye on you.

223
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,386
Mm-kay.

224
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,259
That should adjust for circumstances.

225
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,084
Remember, you have to
keep hold of the baton.

226
00:10:03,085 --> 00:10:05,859
If you let go, it breaks the spell.

227
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,100
Shall we test it?

228
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,559
Okay, kids.

229
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,820
Get ready to be my sock puppets.

230
00:10:12,821 --> 00:10:14,864
What is this sorcery?

231
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:17,240
Woman in my head, reveal yourself!

232
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:26,208
He must have been in range of the spell.

233
00:10:26,209 --> 00:10:29,086
So I have to run a heist
with a pig in my head?

234
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,379
What the shit with the gun?

235
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,673
It is to put in the hands of a hero

236
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:35,759
who will do what is just and necessary.

237
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,122
Which is?

238
00:10:37,123 --> 00:10:40,097
Assassinate she who
plots to destroy Fillory.

239
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,429
Julia Wicker.

240
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:42,851
What the hell is wrong with you?

241
00:10:42,852 --> 00:10:45,089
- Wait, is that thing loaded?
- Of course it is!

242
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:51,059
No, no! Please! People,
the fate of my world is at stake.

243
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,402
Oh, gentlemen, please
control your spinsters.

244
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,415

This is why I don't hang
out with you people.

272
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:56,817
But on the bright side,
we were pitch perfect.

273
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,799
I will kill Julia.

274
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,159
You have my solemn word
as a devout Catholic.

275
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,749
A hero has risen.

276
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,622
With a most excellent singing voice.

277
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:13,449
Well, we'll karaoke in Fillory

278
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,732
because it's definitely
not getting destroyed.

279
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:17,339
- Vaya con Dios.
- Yeah.

280
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,579
I think I speak for the group

281
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,130
in wondering why the fuck
did we all just chorus line?

282
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,931
Yeah, and I heard all of you
in my head, not just Marina.

283
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,099
Yeah, what the hell?

284
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,143
Our circumstances are unstable.

285
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:34,059
Our collective surge of
emotion must have broken down

286
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,889
some of the spell's barriers.

287
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:38,879
And as for the singing, well,
it was designed by a conductor

288
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,779
and music is the purest
manifestation of feeling...

289
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,923
So let me get this straight.

290
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:47,117
Every time we have a feeling,
we're gonna go full-on "Glee"?

291
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:50,489
That doesn't seem ideal
for, you know, a heist.

292
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:51,599
Wait, do you guys remember

293
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,245
when we were learning battle magic?

294
00:13:53,246 --> 00:13:55,959
If the spell's gonna make
us break out into song

295
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,129
every time we get worked up,

296
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,213
why don't we emotion bottle ourselves?

297
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:00,922
'Cause that went so well the last time.

298
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,008
No, no. That's good.

299
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:04,943
It might help also avoid
bellhop detection,

300
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,513
no emotions for them to sense.

301
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,652
So repress the overwhelming urge

302
00:14:09,653 --> 00:14:12,083
to sing while stealing shit.

303
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:14,160
It's eighth grade all over again.

304
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,660
_

305
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,568
Hi. I'm looking for a patient.

306
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:24,114
- Name?
- Neela Adiyodi.

307
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,910
There must be some mistake.
I'm Neela Adiyodi.

308
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,672
I've spent my whole life

309
00:14:31,673 --> 00:14:34,142
thinking my mom was a basket case.

310
00:14:34,143 --> 00:14:36,899
You're telling me she's fine?

311
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,179
She was fine with me.

312
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,672
We need to see how she is with you.

313
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,823
Look, I won't pretend

314
00:14:49,824 --> 00:14:52,267
that I can even imagine
what this is like for you.

315
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,670
But you won't be alone.

316
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,179
We're in. Marina, you copy?

317
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,469
Loud and clear. How
are you guys feeling?

318
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:21,139
We're not.

319
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,059
Pete.

320
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,149
You're up.

321
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,580
- Oh.
- Yeah.

322
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:30,531
Look.

323
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:33,326
Everyone in the know
knows about you guys.

324
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:36,529
And what exactly do they know?

325
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:39,289
The best is barely good enough.

326
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,449
That's what I deal in.

327
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:44,462
Art, spells, totems, best of the best.

328
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,759
- You've got six minutes.
- That's too bad.

329
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,442
I just ordered a bottle
of 2005 Haut-Brion

330
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:54,140
that will take at least
half an hour to decant.

331
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,141
36 minutes, then.

332
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,689
_

333
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,840
Is this the one?

334
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,440
That's...

335
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,188
very moist.

336
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,980
Guys.

337
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,719
The Couple's been translating
the World Seed page.

338
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,559
But wrong.

339
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,350
Grab it.

340
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,539
And we're Fogged.

341
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,585
Guys, what is going on?

342
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,102
Should I wait here for you guys, or?

343
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,731
Sir, there's a problem.

344
00:18:27,834 --> 00:18:29,099
Is that my suitcase?

345
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,159
You told The Couple that

346
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,440
this is a bottle of 2005 Haut-Brion,

347
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,321
when, in fact, it's Two-Buck Chuck.

348
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:38,200
That constitutes deceit,
a violation of hotel protocol.

349
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:39,869
You'll be checking out immediately.

350
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,668
Abort.

351
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:49,836
Fogg 17 showed up.
He's got Team Incubator.

352
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,964
That's catastrophic.

353
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,020
- We rescue them.
- Yup.

354
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,940
All right.

355
00:19:19,742 --> 00:19:21,103
Hello.

356
00:19:21,104 --> 00:19:22,473
Management has been alerted

357
00:19:22,474 --> 00:19:24,121
to the presence of unauthorized guests.

358
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:26,499
- Oh.
- Please present your key cards.

359
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,649
We are late. Sorry.

360
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,969
Hello?

361
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:43,499
Jesus, Alice, what's going on?

362
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,392
Answer me.

363
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:46,893
Eliot? Kady?

364
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,271
Get off of them! Get off of them!

That was interesting.

376
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:36,359
Empath overload.

377
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,479
I doubt it will last.

378
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,156
Alice, let's go.

379
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,784
Okay.

380
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:45,692
Guess Alice had a little moment.

381
00:20:45,693 --> 00:20:48,121
Get your shit together people.

382
00:20:49,363 --> 00:20:52,200
Huh, what do we have here?

383
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,249
Oh, Christ.

384
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,659
You brought the gun. Strong choice.

385
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,883
Thanks.

386
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,929
Thank you, Henry.

387
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,893
George, my pleasure.

388
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:12,437
On our new world, you can
have your own island.

389
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:15,816
No. I want my own goddamn country.

390
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:17,479
Fine.

391
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,819
There won't be a new world.

392
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,979
Really?

393
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,399
Your translation of the page is wrong.

394
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,389
You're going to end up killing the seed.

395
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,659
How would you know?

396
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,785
Smart girl.

397
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:27,953
Keep going.

398
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:29,772
I'm Fillorian.

399
00:21:29,773 --> 00:21:31,206
I can translate the page correctly.

400
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,375
I'll even help you grow the seed.

401
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:36,369
If you spare my friends.

402
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:38,819
I'm so sorry. I can't control it.

403
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,082
I'm sorry.

404
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,099
Your weaponized emotional baggage

405
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:44,180
turned out to be a weirdly good thing.

406
00:21:44,184 --> 00:21:45,887
So Fen pulled a stall.

407
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,953
She's headed to the seed
room with The Couple.

408
00:21:47,954 --> 00:21:50,392
Josh and Margo are still
in their suite with Fogg.

409
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:52,153
Can you get them free?

410
00:21:52,154 --> 00:21:54,019
Kady, if you can take out Fogg alone,

411
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,480
I think I can help Alice.

412
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,080
Good luck.

413
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,700
Alice? Do you trust me?

414
00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:13,039
- What are you doing?
- Just a little sip.

415
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,660
To the confusion of our enemies.

416
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,679
Alice, whatever it is,
whatever you're feeling,

417
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,143
you can just tell me.

418
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,109
I just can't stop thinking
about what he did to me.

419
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,719
I was so, so useless.

420
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,249

468
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,663
It's okay.

469
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,460
First thing you have to do

470
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:28,232
is explain why you want
to build a new world.

471
00:26:28,233 --> 00:26:29,899
- To you?
- To the seed.

472
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,719
It's alive, and in order to grow,

473
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,300
it needs to know exactly
what you want and why.

474
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:40,440
The seed will know if you lie
and will refuse to grow.

475
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:48,480
We've made powerful
enemies here on Earth.

476
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:53,650
And one cursed us, making us...

477
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:55,281
Unable to have children.

478
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:59,430
But on a new world,

479
00:26:59,433 --> 00:27:02,533
beyond the reach of our enemies,

480
00:27:02,534 --> 00:27:04,289
we hope to have a family.

481
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,899
Okay.

482
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,779
I have to admit, that's not a
motive I could have guessed,

483
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:12,256
but do you really think you'd
make the best parents?

484
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,811
Hi, Mom.

485
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,942
William?

486
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,987
You're going to be a father.

487
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,304
That's...

488
00:27:39,305 --> 00:27:41,242
that's wonderful.

489
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:43,300
It's why I'm here.

490
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,751
I need to know everything
you went through.

491
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,000
When did you start hearing voices?

492
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:04,429
About three months into the pregnancy.

493
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:09,299
At first, they thought it
was a chemical imbalance.

494
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,566
But after you were born,
I started to get worse.

495
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,679
They said the stress of
parenting brought on

496
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,360
a latent psychological disorder,

497
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:21,408
probably one I'd inherited.

498
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:28,820
The first time I had to send you away...

499
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,492
I hear myself say that,

500
00:28:34,493 --> 00:28:36,423
and I still can't believe I did it.

501
00:28:36,424 --> 00:28:40,500
- I'm so sorry...
- Mom, I'm okay.

502
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:45,099
I need you to tell me
everything you can.

503
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,439
The voices went away when you did,

504
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,840
and when you came back, so did they.

505
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,619
Every time you came back,

506
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,525
there was less and less
of the little boy...

507
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:57,026
Mom, this isn't about me.

508
00:28:57,027 --> 00:28:59,904
I wanted so much to raise you,

509
00:28:59,905 --> 00:29:02,060
love you, protect you.

510
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,790
But what you needed
protection from was me.

511
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,501
What?

512
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,249
Mom?

513
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,819
I'm sorry. Someone's calling me.

514
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,550
What is it? What do you need?

515
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,090
Mom, there's no one calling you.

516
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:26,265
Of course there is. It must
be one of my patients.

517
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,800
There's more of them.

518
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:34,840
You don't hear them? They're screaming.

519
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:37,759
I don't.

520
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,653
Oh, no. No.

521
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:44,359
No, no, not again. Please stop.

522
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:46,399
You need to hurry it up, Kady.

523
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,830
Just be careful.

524
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:52,359
Guys, it's Kady.

525
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,899
We have a problem.

526
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:03,718
Let me guess, camouflage potion?

527
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:05,386
Liquid explosive?

528
00:30:05,387 --> 00:30:08,960
Ah, good old chloroform. Hmm.

529
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:14,312
Huh. Goddamn scotch.

530
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:17,148
But not just any scotch.

531
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:20,799
Isabella Islay's Single Malt.

532
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,370
God damn it, who knew you had taste?

533
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:27,059
- Wait, no. I need that.
- Are you a drunk now?

534
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,619
Well, congratulations.

535
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,490
Let me help you get back on the wagon.

536
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:38,719
Now why don't you save
us all some trouble

537
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,339
and tell me where the rest
of your colleagues are.

538
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,519
I...

539
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,629
God damn it.

540
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,079
What did you put in this?

541
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,089
A pharmaceutical I bought off
a very helpful bartender.

542
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,889
Street name, Archie.

543
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:57,480
But...

544
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,900
What just happened?

545
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:04,139
I just sent him on a trip
to the Etheric Realm

546
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:07,439
where rules prevent Henry
Fogg from leaving.

547
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,119
Here's hoping they're too high
to notice there's a new one.

548
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,411
Nice work.

549
00:31:11,412 --> 00:31:12,954
Okay. Alice and Eliot?

550
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:15,707
If you're done with the singing?

551
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,209
You sure you're okay?

552
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:21,170
No. But I can do this.

553
00:31:21,171 --> 00:31:25,007
Great, now everything's fine, but...

554
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:27,193
medium-sized bump in the road.

555
00:31:27,194 --> 00:31:31,479
Pete just called from a cell
phone outside the hotel.

556
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:35,430
He got caught doing a very Pete scam

557
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:36,561
and they booted him.

558
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:38,522
- The suitcase?
- Went with him.

559
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:42,109
There goes our escape route.

560
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,790
I'm almost annoyed.

561
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,325
I might have an idea.

562
00:31:58,167 --> 00:31:59,830
Open the window.

563
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,740
Let's hope that works.

564
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:27,869
Well, that was a disaster.

565
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,697
Let's go before I check myself in here.

566
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:31,407
Hang on. Look.

567
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:34,949
When she's alone,
everything's normal, but,

568
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:37,331
but when you show up...

569
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:43,959
My traveler shit doesn't work
and I still mess her up.

570
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,419
Functional or not, you're still you.

571
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:48,499
So it's...

572
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,385
it's gonna be the same
for you and the baby?

573
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:55,010
Unless we figure out what it is

574
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:57,309
and find a way to cut it.

575
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:06,273
Okay, Alice and Eliot are
en route to the basement.

576
00:33:06,274 --> 00:33:09,111
Kady, Josh, Margo, get ready to move.

577
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:11,281
Standing by, Marina.

578
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:13,074
Oh.

579
00:33:15,123 --> 00:33:17,160
If it's the pig again,
we're having pork chops.

580
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:25,332
- You've gotta be shitting me.
- I beg your pardon?

581
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:27,256
Oh, hey, babe. What are you doing here?

582
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:32,093
- I knew it.
- Knew what?

583
00:33:32,094 --> 00:33:34,136
I put a locator spell on the heist book.

584
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,472
And since you've been MIA for two days,

585
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:37,848
I figured I'd find you with it

586
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:41,519
doing exactly what you promised
you'd never do again.

587
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:45,052
Look, babe, it's not what it looks like.

588
00:33:45,053 --> 00:33:48,322
- But I mean, I mean it is, but...
- God, I'm an idiot.

589
00:33:48,323 --> 00:33:50,484
Listen, babe, people's
lives are on the line.

590
00:33:50,485 --> 00:33:51,619
You're doing that thing

591
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,419
where you call me babe a bunch of times,

592
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:56,242
which is exactly how I
know that you're lying.

593
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:58,328
Okay, this is not the time.
And it's also not about you.

594
00:33:58,329 --> 00:34:00,289
So...

595
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:06,168
What the fuck did you just do?

596
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:09,005
Marina, do you copy?

597
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:11,049
Are we good to go?

598
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,802
She's offline.

599
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:17,639
Fair to say, "act out"?

600
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:19,460
I know you mean well, Julia,

601
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:21,008
but I really can't talk right now.

602
00:34:21,009 --> 00:34:24,896
Okay, look, can I just
show you something?

603
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:30,319
Where'd you get this?

604
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:35,239
You see that cord thing between you?

605
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,742
What's going on?

606
00:34:43,624 --> 00:34:45,751
You're not crazy, Neela.

607
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,546
Look, magic is real.

608
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:53,716
I'm a magician. And so is your son.

609
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:55,760
But he's a rare breed

610
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:59,597
with this link that they
have to their mothers.

611
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,515
Every time they're close by...

612
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,726
- Stop!
- ... their abilities start to bleed over...

613
00:35:02,727 --> 00:35:04,186
Stop. Stop!

614
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,188
Just stop.

615
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:11,052
My baby has the same abilities as Penny,

616
00:35:11,053 --> 00:35:13,069
which means it causes the same problems.

617
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,072
Oh, this isn't happening.

618
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:18,299
This is happening.

619
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,079
Look, I swear, I know I'm asking a lot,

620
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,189
but if you could just take a
chance and let me help you,

621
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,699
you could have your son back.

622
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,700
You could get to know your grandchild.

623
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,462
Wouldn't that be worth it?

624
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,301
I can't.

625
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:41,519
I can't go through this again.

626
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,100
It'll kill me.

627
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,740
Tell William I'm sorry.

628
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,099
How many times do I have to tell you

629
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,489
the heist is not for me?

630
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,699
Right, and you're not
fucking the sexy librarian.

631
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,490
Her? Don't be ridiculous.

632
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:05,903
Oh, my, no. But thank you.

633
00:36:05,904 --> 00:36:08,499
How can I believe anything that you say?

634
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,179
It took a fucking spell

635
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,099
for you to care about anyone
other than yourself...

636
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,599
I do care.

637
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,219
But I'm also pretty done bending
over backwards for you.

638
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,399
So you either get on board
with the me who's me,

639
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,080
or you can fuck off.

640
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:23,773
Oh, good.

641
00:36:23,774 --> 00:36:24,849
Thanks.

642
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:28,420
I finally know where we stand.

643
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,199
- Are, are you all right?
- Fix the goddamn baton.

644
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,899
Look, I know this was maybe
worse than you thought,

645
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:50,560
but now we've got a shot at fixing it.

646
00:36:50,564 --> 00:36:52,372
Yeah.

647
00:36:52,373 --> 00:36:54,242
Penny.

648
00:36:54,243 --> 00:36:56,650
She asked me to give you something.

649
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,439
Okay, don't turn down the
temperature without Marina.

650
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,842
If the others aren't ready, it'll...

651
00:37:34,844 --> 00:37:37,046
Kill the seed. I know.

652
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:39,057
Ah, but it wouldn't hurt to
find the right controls...

653
00:37:39,058 --> 00:37:40,357
Get away from the equipment, sir.

654
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:43,183
Oh, my.

655
00:37:43,184 --> 00:37:44,512
This is bad.

656
00:37:44,513 --> 00:37:46,680
Jesus, Eliot, what now?

657
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:49,793
Hello, Marina. Glad you're back with us.

658
00:37:49,794 --> 00:37:53,059
I just need to take
care of this bellhop.

659
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,648
Did you lower the temperature?

660
00:37:54,649 --> 00:37:56,849

George.

690
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,723
I love your blades.

691
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,619
You're a strange girl.

692
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:56,353
Thank you.

693
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,481
If you don't give us the
correct translations soon,

694
00:39:59,482 --> 00:40:03,480
you'll be a strange fingerless girl.

695
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:09,488
Paloma.

696
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:25,548
You do that, the bellhops
will just rip you to shreds.

697
00:40:25,549 --> 00:40:29,469
Yeah, no, we kind of
found their kryptonite.

698
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:33,339
Well, I'm fine slitting her throat.

699
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,400
Yeah, me too.

700
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:38,889
Whoa, everybody just calm down.

701
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:41,779
Okay? Nobody needs to die.

702
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,315
Except the seed

703
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:45,259
if we keep standing around talking.

704
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,569
See, our friends cranked the AC in here.

705
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,822
So unless you wanna kill the seed,

706
00:40:49,823 --> 00:40:53,949
back off and let us put
it in the bag, stat.

707
00:41:01,453 --> 00:41:03,293
Oh, Christ.

708
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,679
Well, now we've all got a problem.

709
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:14,599
Guys, hey. Let's not
die or kill the seed.

710
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,882
Kady, Ball,

711
00:41:17,883 --> 00:41:19,518
drop your knives.

712
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,049
Shit.

713
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:26,149
All right.

714
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:30,680
Now I think I have a fair solution.

715
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,060
- Hands.
- Come on.

716
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:37,619
George!

717
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:44,209
- I got the seed.
- Swallow, Sunshine.

718
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,462
We need to call an ambulance.

719
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,749
The seed. The seed.

720
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:52,259
It's fine.

721
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,303
But where the hell is the seed, Fen?

722
00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:56,680
I've fucking got it, Margo!

723
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,557
Guys, Alice has an exit.

724
00:41:58,558 --> 00:41:59,699
Get to the roof.

725
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,269
Come on. Let's go.

726
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,980
- I can't...
- Run!

Fen, where the fuck is the seed?

733
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:29,519
And why are you running so weird?

734
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,083
The seed is somewhere warm.

735
00:42:32,084 --> 00:42:35,219
Very humid. Even moist?

736
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,759
Oh, whoa.

In here.

739
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,179
So what's the escape plan?

740
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:45,604
It's more of an escape plea.
