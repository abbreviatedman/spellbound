1
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:08,703
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:11,267
I will save the people of Fillory.

3
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,303
The people would decide

4
00:00:15,304 --> 00:00:17,356
to make this dark wizard their king,

5
00:00:17,357 --> 00:00:19,317
the Dark King.

6
00:00:19,318 --> 00:00:21,146
So you built a golem out of living clay,

7
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,868
and then you animated the whole thing

8
00:00:22,869 --> 00:00:24,309
with his essence?

9
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:27,188
No, it's just a tiny grain of Q's soul

10
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:28,608
that I pulled from the Underworld.

11
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:31,088
Put back the piece of Q's
essence that you stole

12
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:32,282
and let him be at rest.

13
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:34,238
Good-bye, Quentin.

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,869
Some surges come and go

15
00:00:35,874 --> 00:00:37,037
and hardly anyone notices.

16
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:40,164
And sometimes it's a catastrophe.

17
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:41,666
Is there any way to predict them?

18
00:00:41,667 --> 00:00:43,284
Look, I need help with
a metamath problem.

19
00:00:43,285 --> 00:00:44,674
My dad had a friend

20
00:00:44,675 --> 00:00:47,985
with a really rare discipline,

21
00:00:47,987 --> 00:00:49,635
predicting circumstances.

22
00:00:49,641 --> 00:00:50,592
- _
- She wrote this.

23
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:52,301
Wait. I recognize these.

24
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,762
Put 'em on a letter,

25
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,597
address it to whoever, wherever,

26
00:00:55,598 --> 00:00:58,475
whenever, and it gets to them.

27
00:01:00,371 --> 00:01:02,551
Because I want you to be safe.

28
00:01:02,561 --> 00:01:04,340
I want you to be safe.

29
00:01:04,341 --> 00:01:06,790
- Are you saying that you...
- No, I'm just...

30
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:09,381
we've tried the whole
"saving each other" thing

31
00:01:09,382 --> 00:01:11,511
with mixed results.

32
00:01:11,514 --> 00:01:13,381
Yeah.

33
00:01:13,386 --> 00:01:14,533
Sure, but I...

34
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:17,503
And I've been thinking
about what works best,

35
00:01:17,513 --> 00:01:19,342
and I think... no, I know...

36
00:01:19,343 --> 00:01:22,222
that we're best when we're a team

37
00:01:22,223 --> 00:01:24,507
and we work together, you and me.

38
00:01:26,203 --> 00:01:28,003
If nothing else, I like the sound of it.

39
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:34,694
Quentin?

40
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:35,971
Quentin!

41
00:01:48,401 --> 00:01:50,101
_

42
00:01:50,121 --> 00:01:51,721
_

43
00:01:51,741 --> 00:01:54,261
_

44
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,701
_

45
00:02:03,787 --> 00:02:05,050
Oh, shit.

46
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:15,112
Whoo, yeah! There she is!

47
00:02:15,113 --> 00:02:16,853
- Champagne for our girl!
- Whoo!

48
00:02:16,854 --> 00:02:19,730
High King Margo, a thousand huzzahs!

49
00:02:19,731 --> 00:02:22,400
- Go, Bambi.
- Um, why?

50
00:02:22,401 --> 00:02:23,776
We wanted to honor you,

51
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:25,445
so when Julia sent us the bunny

52
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:28,023
saying that they put the clock in here,

53
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:30,182
we asked them to stock up
on celebratory beverages.

54
00:02:30,183 --> 00:02:31,764
Stay on mission. We're going back.

55
00:02:31,765 --> 00:02:33,222
Copy. Give me 30.

56
00:02:33,223 --> 00:02:34,342
We'll have cookies to help brainstorm

57
00:02:34,343 --> 00:02:36,186
how you're gonna
overthrow the Dark King.

58
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:42,036
Well, your subjects
are rightly grateful.

59
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:43,904
For sending that letter?

60
00:02:43,905 --> 00:02:45,804
A.K.A. that thing I totally didn't do.

61
00:02:45,805 --> 00:02:46,844
You did.

62
00:02:46,845 --> 00:02:48,034
Why split a hair?

63
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:49,534
Let them bake cookies.

64
00:02:49,535 --> 00:02:51,920
- Lie cookies?
- It's not a lie.

65
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:54,214
You saved them through me, your advisor,

66
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,425
acting on your behalf.

67
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,515
Nice retcon.

68
00:02:56,516 --> 00:02:59,334
Then as a wise king once said,

69
00:02:59,335 --> 00:03:00,811
ovary up.

70
00:03:00,812 --> 00:03:02,265
Let your subjects be inspired

71
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,812
by a simple, uncomplicated story.

72
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,402
That's what the people want.

73
00:03:13,405 --> 00:03:15,220
Would you excuse me?

74
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:19,599
Where are you going,
and why are you dressed

75
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,851
like a goth survivalist?

76
00:03:20,852 --> 00:03:22,569
Fillory, just quick.

77
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,855
- What you got there?
- Nothing.

78
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:28,370
I did a thing. This is a byproduct.

79
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:29,651
I just have to take care of it.

80
00:03:29,652 --> 00:03:32,209
Alice, do you need help?

81
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,906
You seem a little bit distressed.

82
00:03:33,907 --> 00:03:35,529
I'm fine.

83
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:37,050
I just have to do it alone.

84
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,378
Okay, great. What was the spell?

85
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,629
I made a golem, okay?

86
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,490
You've done it before.
It's not a big deal.

87
00:03:43,495 --> 00:03:45,209
A golem of who?

88
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,549
Can we... can we not be
dramatic about this?

89
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,297
I used his book from the Library.

90
00:03:52,424 --> 00:03:54,723
- Quentin's?
- But I was out of my mind,

91
00:03:54,724 --> 00:03:57,019
and I didn't think that
this would just stay here

92
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,484
when I buried the golem
and not be released.

93
00:04:01,484 --> 00:04:02,534
It's Essence.

94
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,058
It's a tiny piece of his soul.

95
00:04:04,059 --> 00:04:06,579
I'm sorry, you pulled an
actual piece of Quentin's soul

96
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,888
out of his... that is insane.

97
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:10,208
- What if it's...
- Keeping him from resting?

98
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,345
- Well, is it?
- I just need to get

99
00:04:12,346 --> 00:04:14,085
to the top of this
mountain and throw it in.

100
00:04:14,086 --> 00:04:15,295
The Mountain of Ghosts

101
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,673
that Rupert Chatwin was looking for

102
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,056
before the band of aggressive

103
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,717
talking squirrels kidnapped him?

104
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,935
I'm finally reading the books.

105
00:04:20,936 --> 00:04:22,812
Margo has been on my ass about it.

106
00:04:22,813 --> 00:04:24,514
Anyway, is that it?

107
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,084
The one with the hole
at the top that goes...

108
00:04:26,094 --> 00:04:27,486
All the way down to the Underworld?

109
00:04:29,364 --> 00:04:31,614
- Yes.
- Well, this is too important.

110
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,398
- I'm helping.
- I don't need your help.

111
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,406
Well, you're getting it.

112
00:04:38,795 --> 00:04:39,995
Fine.

113
00:04:45,395 --> 00:04:50,006
- Synced & corrected by<font color="#E83286"> MementMori </font>-
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.addic7ed.com</font> --

114
00:05:00,951 --> 00:05:03,480
Head hurt from the patch?

115
00:05:03,481 --> 00:05:06,830
Uh, it beats the noise.

116
00:05:06,831 --> 00:05:08,350
Burning through them, though,

117
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:11,830
so looking for some real answers.

118
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:15,330
None of these books is for shit.

119
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:17,984
Requested some from the Library
but not getting the sense

120
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,809
they're gonna be that speedy.

121
00:05:20,864 --> 00:05:25,104
So, while you're waiting...

122
00:05:26,204 --> 00:05:28,943
God, that... always a great idea,

123
00:05:28,944 --> 00:05:30,604
but I really do have a headache.

124
00:05:30,612 --> 00:05:33,365
No, I need a ride.

125
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,385
Fine.

126
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,373
I've been thinking, we should tell her.

127
00:05:47,374 --> 00:05:50,333
Look, can we just concentrate
one thing at a time, please?

128
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:52,608
Let's just get her back
on the throne, huh?

129
00:05:52,609 --> 00:05:55,349
Yeah, well, with those
banishment brands,

130
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:56,606
good luck getting her in the kingdom,

131
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,431
never mind the castle.

132
00:05:58,432 --> 00:05:59,526
Oh, shit.

133
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,155
What month is it in Fillory?

134
00:06:01,156 --> 00:06:02,765
Is it spring yet?

135
00:06:02,766 --> 00:06:04,908
Yellow Ferret Month, yes.

136
00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:06,786
Have you ever seen the
movie "The Dirty Dozen"?

137
00:06:06,793 --> 00:06:07,995
Not the porn one.

138
00:06:07,996 --> 00:06:09,910
No, and I have a life, so summarize.

139
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,006
Uh, not important.

140
00:06:11,016 --> 00:06:13,365
Point is, it inspired
me to do this thing

141
00:06:13,366 --> 00:06:16,365
when the Taker attacks
were just starting.

142
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:18,128
We needed better guards,

143
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:21,006
so I created an annual tournament.

144
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:22,765
First week of the month
of the Yellow Ferret

145
00:06:22,766 --> 00:06:25,506
to find the 12 greatest
fighters in the land

146
00:06:25,516 --> 00:06:29,235
to become our elite Centurion Guard.

147
00:06:29,236 --> 00:06:31,445
- Pretty cool name, right?
- Yeah.

148
00:06:31,446 --> 00:06:32,827
Anyway, we offered fame,

149
00:06:32,828 --> 00:06:36,245
glory, and instant wipe-clean
of your criminal record,

150
00:06:36,246 --> 00:06:38,815
including... uh-huh... banishment marks.

151
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:39,982
And if they still hold the tournament,

152
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,889
it would be going on now, as we speak.

153
00:06:42,894 --> 00:06:45,405
We should check on that, no?

154
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,070
It's Living Stone, I think.

155
00:06:53,074 --> 00:06:54,456
Huh.

156
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:56,225
"Beware Takers."

157
00:06:56,226 --> 00:06:57,797
"Beyond The Wall Adventure Tours,

158
00:06:57,798 --> 00:06:58,966
500 feet that way."

159
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:02,585
Fill 'em.

160
00:07:02,586 --> 00:07:04,215
Rocks, lots of dust.

161
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,904
That'll be heavy.

162
00:07:05,912 --> 00:07:07,473
Burns Takers.

163
00:07:07,474 --> 00:07:08,613
They come at night.

164
00:07:08,614 --> 00:07:10,473
We'll make a circle to camp in.

165
00:07:10,474 --> 00:07:13,654
Or, hey, travel light
if you want to die.

166
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:17,317
So... Takers. What exactly are they?

167
00:07:17,318 --> 00:07:19,319
You really don't know?

168
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,966
No.

169
00:07:23,434 --> 00:07:24,986
Umber's tit.

170
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,503
Don't tell me you're grievers.

171
00:07:26,504 --> 00:07:28,205
What's wrong with that?

172
00:07:28,206 --> 00:07:30,165
You're not prepared for the mountain.

173
00:07:30,206 --> 00:07:32,245
You can't run fast because
you've been sitting around

174
00:07:32,246 --> 00:07:33,485
eating cake and crying.

175
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:36,235
Okay, I can grieve and
handle a little cardio,

176
00:07:36,236 --> 00:07:37,306
thank you very much.

177
00:07:37,307 --> 00:07:39,434
Yeah, we're Magicians. We'll be fine.

178
00:07:39,435 --> 00:07:41,436
Don't say I didn't warn you.

179
00:07:42,437 --> 00:07:44,130
You're planning to throw
something in at the top,

180
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,156
keep it safe.

181
00:07:45,181 --> 00:07:47,020
Takers don't just take people.

182
00:07:47,045 --> 00:07:49,712
They know what thing
you value and swipe it.

183
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,459
Alice.

184
00:07:58,044 --> 00:07:59,841
This zips.

185
00:07:59,842 --> 00:08:02,056
It's the safest thing we've got.

186
00:08:03,006 --> 00:08:04,934
Alice, please let me take it.

187
00:08:04,935 --> 00:08:06,492
Okay.

188
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:51,237
Well, this stopped being fun.

189
00:08:51,238 --> 00:08:52,657
Yeah, well, you wanted to come.

190
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:54,877
Sure did. And it's awful.

191
00:08:54,878 --> 00:08:56,897
Yeah, well, it's meant to be.

192
00:08:56,898 --> 00:08:57,997
But maybe you don't feel that way

193
00:08:57,998 --> 00:08:59,938
because it's not your pilgrimage.

194
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,551
What's that supposed to mean?

195
00:09:03,552 --> 00:09:05,962
Nothing. Can we please not bicker?

196
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,986
Sure. Let's not bicker.

197
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:11,046
What did you mean by not my pilgrimage?

198
00:09:13,276 --> 00:09:15,995
I mean I'm here putting
my boyfriend to rest,

199
00:09:15,996 --> 00:09:17,795
and you tagged along.

200
00:09:17,796 --> 00:09:19,915
Right.

201
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,255
Because I barely knew him.

202
00:09:21,256 --> 00:09:23,313
You know what I mean.

203
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:26,392
You're here out of some sort
of combination of thinking

204
00:09:26,393 --> 00:09:27,985
I'm incompetent and your guilt

205
00:09:27,986 --> 00:09:29,818
- that he died saving you.
- You know what?

206
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,292
You are way too smart for me to ascribe

207
00:09:32,293 --> 00:09:34,240
what just you said to total stupidity,

208
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,769
so I'm gonna go ahead
and I'm gonna file it

209
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,044
under you must be fucking
joking right now.

210
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:39,789
No, I'm not!

211
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:43,009
This is hard enough
without you judging me

212
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,309
every step of the way.

213
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,829
Is that how you don't bicker?

214
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,009
'Cause that would explain a lot

215
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,630
about how you and Q kept falling apart,

216
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,340
beyond the obvious, of course.

217
00:09:50,341 --> 00:09:51,800
- The obvious?
- Yeah.

218
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,839
What, like drunk threesomes
with you and Margo?

219
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,259
Oh, hmm, solid point,
but I was thinking more

220
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,610
that one time where you
betrayed all of us,

221
00:09:58,611 --> 00:10:00,519
I ended up possessed, and Q died

222
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,940
cleaning up the mess.

223
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:07,924
And time for Yan to roll a smoke.

224
00:10:09,592 --> 00:10:11,468
That was a little harsh.

225
00:10:11,469 --> 00:10:13,637
And correct.

226
00:10:13,638 --> 00:10:18,068
But not right because
you also saved my life.

227
00:10:18,071 --> 00:10:19,577
Right.

228
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:21,718
Trying to fix the mess I made.

229
00:10:23,862 --> 00:10:25,585
Here we are again.

230
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,918
So let's just finish this, okay?

231
00:10:36,715 --> 00:10:38,800
Yan, let's go.

232
00:10:38,801 --> 00:10:40,301
Finished with your feelings?

233
00:10:41,386 --> 00:10:43,127
Yes.

234
00:10:45,128 --> 00:10:46,218
Uh...

235
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:49,175
Alice, no. Don't go that way.

236
00:11:00,018 --> 00:11:02,270
Good luck, and enjoy the tournament.

237
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:03,614
Hello.

238
00:11:03,615 --> 00:11:06,399
I am Bick of the
esteemed House Pickwick.

239
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,634
- Who is entering?
- Me.

240
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:10,194
Your name?

241
00:11:10,195 --> 00:11:11,379
- Janet.
- Janet.

242
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,768
Pluchinsky.

243
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:14,230
Weapon of choice?

244
00:11:14,231 --> 00:11:16,775
Me. But also, I like axes.

245
00:11:17,979 --> 00:11:19,320
Ah.

246
00:11:19,895 --> 00:11:22,628
You are registered. Proceed...

247
00:11:22,629 --> 00:11:23,833
I'm entering too.

248
00:11:24,241 --> 00:11:26,753
I just want to.

249
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:30,398
My name's Fen... cicle.

250
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,327
Wahl... burger.

251
00:11:32,328 --> 00:11:34,623
- Weapon of choice?
- Knives.

252
00:11:35,718 --> 00:11:38,281
I choose to use my Childsplay knives,

253
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:41,785
the kind of knives they give
to very young children.

254
00:11:42,486 --> 00:11:43,953
Wow.

255
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,947
You had some kind of childhood.

256
00:11:47,565 --> 00:11:49,167
Hmm.

257
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,336
Okay, so I found you this.

258
00:11:54,337 --> 00:11:55,356
Fuck my life.

259
00:11:55,357 --> 00:11:56,706
Or I can get you something else.

260
00:11:56,707 --> 00:11:57,716
I just tried to do Singh's

261
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,052
Advanced Skin Hardening
twice, and touch me.

262
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,886
Smooth and perfect,

263
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,697
and I'm getting eaten alive

264
00:12:03,707 --> 00:12:06,225
by whimsical goddamn Fillorian bugs.

265
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,276
Huh.

266
00:12:07,277 --> 00:12:09,857
Um, you know what?

267
00:12:09,867 --> 00:12:12,523
You just keep practicing
that shield casting,

268
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:16,062
and I'm, uh, gonna go check
on something real quick.

269
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,003
_

270
00:12:26,032 --> 00:12:27,574
_

271
00:12:27,575 --> 00:12:29,040
Do we even have an appointment?

272
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,541
What do you think?

273
00:12:36,826 --> 00:12:39,796
What the hell just happened?

274
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,760
Where are we?

275
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,346
Um, excuse me. Is this PK Endeavors?

276
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:45,764
- I have an appointment.
- These two look confused.

277
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,766
Hi. Zoe Markus. I run the joint.

278
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,058
Julia Wicker. We e-mailed.

279
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,845
Hey, why does this place look exactly

280
00:12:50,846 --> 00:12:52,126
like the Physical Kids' cottage?

281
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,113
You went to Brakebills?

282
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,784
I'm a professor at Brakebills.

283
00:12:56,785 --> 00:12:58,786
Really?

284
00:12:58,787 --> 00:13:01,489
Brakebills. Best years of my life.

285
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:02,640
Hence...

286
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:04,492
I did a study.

287
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,142
Most Magicians cast 23% more accurately

288
00:13:07,151 --> 00:13:08,373
when they've been drinking.

289
00:13:08,374 --> 00:13:10,412
God, we're fucked.

290
00:13:11,432 --> 00:13:13,722
So what can I help you with?

291
00:13:13,723 --> 00:13:15,081
Stocks, you said?

292
00:13:15,082 --> 00:13:16,562
I did say that.

293
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:19,186
Uh, we were hoping to talk
to your sister Daniella.

294
00:13:19,187 --> 00:13:19,966
How come?

295
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,465
Well, um, to start,

296
00:13:21,466 --> 00:13:22,885
you know how magic was regulated?

297
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,511
Until it wasn't, thank God.

298
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,552
Well, we stopped that, and a lot worse.

299
00:13:27,553 --> 00:13:29,722
A friend of ours did,

300
00:13:29,723 --> 00:13:31,853
but there were side effects.

301
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,486
Like the surges, which are...

302
00:13:33,487 --> 00:13:34,727
Getting stronger.

303
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:38,609
We're concerned we're heading
towards a major event.

304
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,026
And you need...

305
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,154
Daniella to predict

306
00:13:41,155 --> 00:13:42,722
when it's going to happen.

307
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,282
We'll pay what we can.

308
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:49,354
Zoe, you and your sister would
be helping to save the world.

309
00:13:50,521 --> 00:13:52,950
- I'd love to help...
- Great.

310
00:13:52,951 --> 00:13:55,702
But unfortunately, I must decline.

311
00:13:55,703 --> 00:13:57,495
Please, stay as long as you like.

312
00:13:57,496 --> 00:13:58,696
Wait.

313
00:13:59,218 --> 00:14:00,374
Shit.

314
00:14:01,781 --> 00:14:03,400
- Shit.
- It's okay.

315
00:14:03,401 --> 00:14:05,741
We'll figure something out. Come on.

316
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:16,962
Okay, so I got some kinda bad news.

317
00:14:16,963 --> 00:14:18,993
Fillory has two moons,
and if either is full,

318
00:14:19,002 --> 00:14:20,511
then wolf time.

319
00:14:20,512 --> 00:14:21,845
So one of them's full soon?

320
00:14:21,846 --> 00:14:23,342
Both are tomorrow night,

321
00:14:23,343 --> 00:14:26,350
which is why your wolf PMS
is acting so bad right now.

322
00:14:26,351 --> 00:14:28,102
I'm about to be a double werewolf?

323
00:14:28,103 --> 00:14:30,502
It's okay because there are still cages.

324
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:32,413
I checked, so it's totally fine.

325
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,582
- It's not fine.
- You're doing great.

326
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:37,601
No, the skin-hardening spell
I keep trying to cast

327
00:14:37,602 --> 00:14:38,941
so I don't get flayed alive

328
00:14:38,942 --> 00:14:41,021
only stuck to the left half of my body,

329
00:14:41,022 --> 00:14:43,062
and also...

330
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:45,071
I want to murder everything.

331
00:14:45,072 --> 00:14:47,941
Oh, uh, more than usual?

332
00:14:47,942 --> 00:14:49,161
Yes, in fact.

333
00:14:49,162 --> 00:14:50,848
Well, maybe just some deep breaths,

334
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,498
- and you know, you got this, so...
- Fuck breathing.

335
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:54,718
I'm too annoyed to breathe.

336
00:14:54,725 --> 00:14:56,087
Mm.

337
00:14:56,295 --> 00:14:59,204
But I like you anyway.

338
00:14:59,731 --> 00:15:02,210
Thanks for the cheerleading, wolf boy.

339
00:15:03,255 --> 00:15:05,375
Uh, of course.

340
00:15:05,381 --> 00:15:07,225
That's fine.

341
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,256
The air's so thin up here,
I think I'm hallucinating.

342
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,861
We're gonna need to rest
before we go again.

343
00:15:17,867 --> 00:15:20,374
I just wanna pin the circle in place.

344
00:15:27,465 --> 00:15:28,841
Eliot.

345
00:15:36,857 --> 00:15:38,856
Hey, Eliot.

346
00:15:42,146 --> 00:15:43,651
Okay, just...

347
00:15:50,201 --> 00:15:52,871
Okay.

348
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,873
Eliot, Taker! Back up!

349
00:15:56,873 --> 00:15:58,423
Q's vial, you set it down.

350
00:15:59,433 --> 00:16:01,794
Fuck! Just stay in the circle.

351
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,295
Eliot, no!

352
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:17,926
Fuck.

353
00:17:06,032 --> 00:17:07,635
You all right?

354
00:17:08,232 --> 00:17:09,178
Uh...

355
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:11,435
I'm really glad I took the north trail.

356
00:17:11,436 --> 00:17:13,645
Pretty sure I'm gladder.

357
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,939
Who needs a drink?

358
00:17:21,862 --> 00:17:23,985
Sorry, are you still...

359
00:17:23,986 --> 00:17:25,698
Oh, yeah, no. We're
just about done here.

360
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:27,116
Hold on.

361
00:17:27,117 --> 00:17:28,409
Any luck?

362
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,453
Yeah, Zoe definitely
went here in the '90s,

363
00:17:30,454 --> 00:17:32,744
but her professors don't
seem to remember her.

364
00:17:33,035 --> 00:17:35,949
She did a lot of field
work in Poland, I guess.

365
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,119
Zoe Markus?

366
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,539
Yeah, do you know her?

367
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:42,603
Well, she was my lab partner.

368
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,963
Oh, my God, we dropped
so much acid together.

369
00:17:46,113 --> 00:17:47,632
We went to visit her work.

370
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,372
She's a big financial advisor.

371
00:17:49,373 --> 00:17:50,582
Seriously?

372
00:17:51,663 --> 00:17:52,932
Wow.

373
00:17:52,933 --> 00:17:54,572
I mean, she was really
not into money at all

374
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,004
when I knew her and her sisters.

375
00:17:56,005 --> 00:17:58,292
Sisters? More than one?

376
00:17:58,293 --> 00:18:01,462
Yeah. Beth, Zoe, and Dani
who... no offense...

377
00:18:01,463 --> 00:18:04,033
is a little weird.

378
00:18:04,043 --> 00:18:07,057
Rumor has it that they averted
apocalypse in senior year.

379
00:18:22,443 --> 00:18:24,032
They're good.

380
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:29,217
Janet of House Pluchinsky,

381
00:18:29,663 --> 00:18:33,871
versus Faun of House Kaiko Swordmasters.

382
00:18:40,513 --> 00:18:41,829
Whoo!

383
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:48,033
Fencicle of House Wahlburger.

384
00:18:58,971 --> 00:18:59,995
What?

385
00:19:02,921 --> 00:19:04,852
Whoa!

386
00:19:33,997 --> 00:19:35,174
God.

387
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:46,477
Goddamn!

388
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:47,796
We've been wasting her, right?

389
00:19:47,797 --> 00:19:49,130
This is, like, spy movie perfect.

390
00:19:49,131 --> 00:19:50,436
You're both in the dirty dozen,

391
00:19:50,437 --> 00:19:51,592
and I'm the guy on the outside.

392
00:19:51,593 --> 00:19:54,387
Victors, please approach the dais.

393
00:19:55,226 --> 00:19:56,766
Congratulations.

394
00:20:00,474 --> 00:20:03,093
Fencicle, what is your persuasion?

395
00:20:03,094 --> 00:20:05,834
I mostly date humans.

396
00:20:05,836 --> 00:20:07,101
Are you a female?

397
00:20:08,936 --> 00:20:10,224
And you, Janet?

398
00:20:10,232 --> 00:20:11,312
Duh.

399
00:20:11,313 --> 00:20:14,982
There can, of course, only
be one female Centurion.

400
00:20:14,983 --> 00:20:16,966
And act three twist.

401
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,842
For all the obvious reasons.

402
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,802
Um, not obvious to me.

403
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:23,594
I know, dear. That's one of the reasons.

404
00:20:24,504 --> 00:20:25,823
You spar by the light

405
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:29,185
of the glorious double
full moon tomorrow night.

406
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,855
- Tomorrow night?
- That's no good.

407
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:33,225
- I've got plans.
- Me too. I mean...

408
00:20:33,226 --> 00:20:36,809
Oh, gravest apologies,
but the schedule...

409
00:20:36,817 --> 00:20:38,119
Chucklebuddy,

410
00:20:38,123 --> 00:20:40,448
I have a sexually transmitted curse.

411
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:42,668
Sun goes down tomorrow, I go wolf.

412
00:20:42,678 --> 00:20:44,165
- This guy goes wolf.
- Hi.

413
00:20:46,158 --> 00:20:47,537
Ember's balls.

414
00:20:49,328 --> 00:20:51,756
And her, too, for some reason.

415
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,628
That what you want here?

416
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,218
Sure to be entertaining.

417
00:20:57,428 --> 00:20:59,785
Probably be everyone
in here's last show.

418
00:21:04,018 --> 00:21:06,291
- Reschedule the mimes.
- Yes, sir.

419
00:21:06,292 --> 00:21:07,957
Your match will occur

420
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,168
in the hour before sundown tomorrow.

421
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:20,097
Margo, Josh and I only...
six or seven or...

422
00:21:20,098 --> 00:21:23,038
it was less than a dozen
times, give or take,

423
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:24,825
and we would have never, ever done it

424
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,577
- if we had known...
- Excuse me.

425
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,298
I need to sharpen my axe.

426
00:21:31,229 --> 00:21:35,316
Well, please say something
nice at my funeral.

427
00:21:41,075 --> 00:21:42,764
So, Loria.

428
00:21:43,202 --> 00:21:47,348
I was making ends meet
selling rare objects.

429
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:49,934
Of course, when I got
there, I mostly drank.

430
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:52,401
I think this story's
making me sound much less

431
00:21:52,402 --> 00:21:54,063
mentally well-composed
than I actually am.

432
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:56,426
We are literally camping
on the Saddlehorn.

433
00:21:57,783 --> 00:22:01,762
Anyway, I was at the border
when I saw my first Taker.

434
00:22:01,763 --> 00:22:03,552
That thing you did...

435
00:22:03,553 --> 00:22:07,228
I tried to throw something
at one earlier, and nothing.

436
00:22:07,229 --> 00:22:09,078
Well, most things don't work.

437
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:10,962
Well, the Dark King can fend them off.

438
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:14,507
There are a few of us out
here who figured out ways.

439
00:22:14,508 --> 00:22:15,543
How?

440
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:18,212
When it touched me,
it... it felt like a virus,

441
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:19,772
a plague.

442
00:22:19,773 --> 00:22:22,804
I shot something off on
instinct, an anti-viral.

443
00:22:22,805 --> 00:22:25,014
You're a Magician from Earth?

444
00:22:25,015 --> 00:22:27,600
My family is.

445
00:22:27,601 --> 00:22:29,515
Well, do you think you can
show us what you did?

446
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:32,141
I... I will teach you whatever I can.

447
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:35,478
And something else I can share...

448
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:38,274
Lucky that the Taker didn't snatch it.

449
00:22:39,133 --> 00:22:40,682
Thank you.

450
00:22:40,683 --> 00:22:42,512
Is that Lorian Bumble Wine?

451
00:22:42,513 --> 00:22:43,849
Uh-huh.

452
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:46,813
Cures altitude sickness,
opens the lungs,

453
00:22:46,819 --> 00:22:48,604
and gets you smashed.

454
00:22:50,064 --> 00:22:51,481
Wait, I was gonna...

455
00:22:51,482 --> 00:22:53,316
I was gonna say,
you should go easy on that.

456
00:22:53,317 --> 00:22:54,832
Oh, my God.

457
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:57,091
It's too late now. I'm sorry.

458
00:22:57,092 --> 00:22:58,753
- Well, cheers to that.
- Mm.

459
00:23:01,712 --> 00:23:02,851
Mm.

460
00:23:02,852 --> 00:23:05,301
- You're a danger tourist?
- No.

461
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:06,994
Mourning someone.

462
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:09,415
Who was it?

463
00:23:09,416 --> 00:23:11,215
I mean, if you want to say.

464
00:23:11,216 --> 00:23:13,076
Well...

465
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:16,135
The love of my life.

466
00:23:16,136 --> 00:23:18,731
Died ridiculously young,
but he was a Magician,

467
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,758
and there's nothing more
dangerous than that.

468
00:23:21,831 --> 00:23:23,560
My dreams were so filled with him,

469
00:23:23,561 --> 00:23:25,292
I was convinced he was haunting me.

470
00:23:25,888 --> 00:23:30,242
So I took his diary up to
the top of the mountain

471
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,727
and threw it in.

472
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:37,057
I felt a little better, so who knows?

473
00:23:37,058 --> 00:23:40,351
- But you're here again.
- I come every year.

474
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:41,391
To honor him.

475
00:23:41,392 --> 00:23:43,239
My boyfriend died.

476
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:45,561
Well, my on and off again...

477
00:23:45,562 --> 00:23:47,910
it was... it's complicated.

478
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:50,329
I don't like talking about it.

479
00:23:50,607 --> 00:23:52,607
I understand.

480
00:23:56,196 --> 00:23:57,572
You knew him too?

481
00:23:58,897 --> 00:24:01,715
Um... good friend.

482
00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:06,038
It's nice that you can do this together.

483
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:08,536
Yes, cheers to that too.

484
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:13,749
Well, I think I should start thinking

485
00:24:13,751 --> 00:24:17,139
about going to lie down so...
my eggs are scrambled.

486
00:24:17,145 --> 00:24:18,456
They sure are.

487
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,491
Hi, Daniella?

488
00:24:28,742 --> 00:24:30,412
Awkward.

489
00:24:30,414 --> 00:24:32,282
Um, we didn't mean to scare you.

490
00:24:32,286 --> 00:24:33,908
We just wanted to talk to you
and your sister about...

491
00:24:33,909 --> 00:24:35,577
What the hell are you doing?

492
00:24:35,578 --> 00:24:37,162
I told you we can't help you.

493
00:24:37,163 --> 00:24:39,292
- You can, but you won't.
- Hey, look.

494
00:24:39,293 --> 00:24:41,665
We're not asking you to join the fight.

495
00:24:41,666 --> 00:24:43,857
- We just need your help in the...
- It's not just.

496
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:46,426
You think she'll stop if
she knows the stakes?

497
00:24:46,427 --> 00:24:48,756
- Tell me about the problem.
- Don't!

498
00:24:48,757 --> 00:24:49,846
Unless you wanna explain

499
00:24:49,847 --> 00:24:50,956
how obsessed you get,

500
00:24:50,957 --> 00:24:52,016
how you nearly got yourself killed,

501
00:24:52,017 --> 00:24:54,685
how Beth did get killed.

502
00:24:56,812 --> 00:24:59,141
- Look, we're sorry.
- I'm not.

503
00:24:59,142 --> 00:25:00,772
Look, I get that you've lost a lot,

504
00:25:00,773 --> 00:25:02,642
but so have we.

505
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,692
We need your help. I'm just saying...

506
00:25:04,695 --> 00:25:06,486
We already saved the world, okay?

507
00:25:06,487 --> 00:25:09,114
We get to be done.

508
00:25:09,115 --> 00:25:10,908
Now get out.

509
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:11,994
Don't come back.

510
00:25:15,331 --> 00:25:19,510
There is nothing like
two grieving lunatics

511
00:25:19,511 --> 00:25:23,460
drinking themselves to death
on a mountain of ghosts.

512
00:25:23,461 --> 00:25:24,898
Cheers.

513
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,297
Mm.

514
00:25:26,298 --> 00:25:29,153
Oh, it's a good sky tonight.

515
00:25:32,975 --> 00:25:34,065
Please.

516
00:25:44,526 --> 00:25:46,355
I used to do this with him.

517
00:25:46,356 --> 00:25:50,075
We'd go somewhere, camp out,

518
00:25:50,824 --> 00:25:55,621
and use illusion magic to
change the color of the stars.

519
00:25:58,082 --> 00:25:59,879
Sounds perfect.

520
00:26:07,001 --> 00:26:09,128
Have you ever had love?

521
00:26:14,011 --> 00:26:15,866
Love? Uh, like...

522
00:26:15,866 --> 00:26:16,992
Love.

523
00:26:17,196 --> 00:26:18,811
It's okay. You can say anything.

524
00:26:19,311 --> 00:26:21,210
I'm a stranger and you're drunk.

525
00:26:27,454 --> 00:26:29,623
The friend we're putting to rest.

526
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:33,131
Wasn't just a friend.

527
00:26:34,491 --> 00:26:37,496
- Does she know?
- Oh, God, no.

528
00:26:37,843 --> 00:26:40,630
A torrid secret affair.

529
00:26:40,631 --> 00:26:42,126
Nothing like that.

530
00:26:42,681 --> 00:26:43,877
Hmm.

531
00:26:44,211 --> 00:26:46,090
It seems a bit selfish, then.

532
00:26:46,991 --> 00:26:50,461
I'm just saying that seems
rather important information

533
00:26:50,465 --> 00:26:52,302
that he can't give her.

534
00:26:52,761 --> 00:26:54,880
I mean, why punish her like that?

535
00:26:54,881 --> 00:26:56,306
Why spare her?

536
00:26:56,765 --> 00:26:58,514
You don't seem close.

537
00:26:59,017 --> 00:27:02,515
Because she really, really loved him.

538
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:03,647
So did you.

539
00:27:04,185 --> 00:27:05,040
Yeah.

540
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,039
So I don't her want to think...

541
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,439
Have you ever noticed that
people generally think

542
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,899
what the hell they want?

543
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,399
I'm starting to think

544
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,067
that you're a little
bit of a shit-stirrer.

545
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,919
I just fundamentally
believe that the best way

546
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,239
to honor someone is
with the truth of them.

547
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,479
You could give her more of that truth,

548
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,750
but you won't.

549
00:27:26,752 --> 00:27:28,359
I just want everybody
to remember Quentin

550
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,800
however they want to and to...

551
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:31,508
to get through the fucking day.

552
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,594
I'm just pointing out,

553
00:27:34,178 --> 00:27:36,722
what you've got in that secret pocket

554
00:27:37,098 --> 00:27:39,558
could help her remember
the real Quentin.

555
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:49,485
Death is so simple,

556
00:27:49,916 --> 00:27:52,112
and life is so complicated.

557
00:27:53,403 --> 00:27:54,656
I know.

558
00:28:01,466 --> 00:28:03,123
Well...

559
00:28:03,716 --> 00:28:05,209
I should go to bed.

560
00:28:06,251 --> 00:28:08,800
Before things get any more complicated.

561
00:28:21,141 --> 00:28:22,768
Years ago,

562
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:27,279
the Dark King, in a show
of progressiveness,

563
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,460
allowed that there might be a female

564
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:33,549
among his Centurions
if one proved worthy.

565
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:38,019
This year we have two competitors

566
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,064
of the weaker sex.

567
00:28:40,065 --> 00:28:41,849
I know, I know.

568
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:43,560
Or you could walk away.

569
00:28:43,569 --> 00:28:45,445
Can't. This is for Fillory.

570
00:28:45,446 --> 00:28:47,829
You're a little wolf crazy
right now, and mad.

571
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,199
You might actually kill her.

572
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,049
I know how to properly
lightly maim someone.

573
00:28:51,050 --> 00:28:52,452
Thanks for your concern.

574
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:56,391
Janet Fencicle, let the battle commence!

575
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,701
You smell anxious.

576
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:08,069
And you smell angry, so
please let me stab you.

577
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:10,665
- You are out of your mind.
- Margo, please.

578
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:13,961
Actually worked.

579
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:15,461
That's no fair, 'cause you can do magic.

580
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,453
You can do that twirly knife shit.

581
00:29:17,454 --> 00:29:18,583
You have an axe.

582
00:29:18,584 --> 00:29:20,742
Fine. No magic.

583
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:35,452
Magic.

584
00:29:35,453 --> 00:29:36,550
Oops.

585
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:56,661
We have a victor... a victorette.

586
00:29:59,479 --> 00:30:02,711
Your new lady Centurion.

587
00:30:04,582 --> 00:30:07,352
I'm so sorry, Fen.

588
00:30:15,923 --> 00:30:18,442
That was so well played!

589
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:21,011
How you knew to grab my knife.

590
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:23,020
Did I know that?

591
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:24,391
Of course you did. Childsplay knife.

592
00:30:24,392 --> 00:30:25,731
Perfectly safe.
We make them for children

593
00:30:25,732 --> 00:30:27,567
so they can practice.

594
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:32,289
Sir, can you please bring
us to the werewolf cages?

595
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:33,916
Quickly? Thanks.

596
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:48,664
I think I'll take the east view.

597
00:30:49,061 --> 00:30:52,311
I'll find you later if you
want to hike down together.

598
00:31:13,091 --> 00:31:15,290
I'll just give you a moment.

599
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:17,401
No, stay.

600
00:31:20,749 --> 00:31:22,447
You cared about him too.

601
00:31:30,573 --> 00:31:32,624
Do you think it goes all the
way down to the Underworld?

602
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:36,378
I hope so, for Q.

603
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,540
Is there anything you
want to say to him?

604
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:59,099
Rest.

605
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:07,605
Okay, I think we can go now.

606
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:11,029
Wait, there's one more thing.

607
00:32:11,034 --> 00:32:12,948
Uh...

608
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,651
Wait, this stamp is enchanted.

609
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,090
_

610
00:32:27,691 --> 00:32:31,200
- You could send this to him.
- Mm-hmm.

611
00:32:31,201 --> 00:32:33,830
Before... oh, my God, Eliot.

612
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,500
You didn't send it 'cause you
were worried it could be...

613
00:32:37,502 --> 00:32:39,023
So much worse if I changed it.

614
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,588
- Alice...
- Huh?

615
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:48,610
Is there a way that we
could really, truly know?

616
00:32:48,611 --> 00:32:51,691
Eliot, I really don't know.

617
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:58,391
S... sometimes I just wish
if you all just went faster,

618
00:32:58,392 --> 00:32:59,571
if you just...

619
00:33:00,652 --> 00:33:02,791
Just locked the fucking door.

620
00:33:02,792 --> 00:33:05,121
No, because Everett would still...

621
00:33:05,122 --> 00:33:07,071
Right, Everett. Of course.

622
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,779
Q...

623
00:33:10,483 --> 00:33:12,204
If Q hadn't stopped Everett, then...

624
00:33:12,205 --> 00:33:14,414
So many more people could die.

625
00:33:14,415 --> 00:33:17,792
But I just keep thinking if...
if I can just crack the code

626
00:33:17,793 --> 00:33:18,962
then... then we can fix it.

627
00:33:18,963 --> 00:33:20,282
I don't think there's a perfect code

628
00:33:20,283 --> 00:33:21,630
for changing the past.

629
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:24,198
I can't send it,

630
00:33:24,199 --> 00:33:27,297
but I... I can't just let go.

631
00:33:27,699 --> 00:33:29,424
It's okay.

632
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,833
He was your friend.

633
00:33:31,834 --> 00:33:34,304
He wasn't just my friend.

634
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:44,494
I'm sorry.

635
00:33:46,514 --> 00:33:48,153
He loved you.

636
00:33:48,154 --> 00:33:50,919
I... why would I want to
take that away from you now?

637
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,864
That would be so cruel.

638
00:33:53,644 --> 00:33:56,175
You really think I didn't
know there was more?

639
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,401
I knew Q really well.

640
00:34:05,035 --> 00:34:07,525
And if anyone was messy, it was him.

641
00:34:09,835 --> 00:34:11,295
Yeah.

642
00:34:12,613 --> 00:34:14,828
He was pretty in love with you.

643
00:34:16,997 --> 00:34:18,896
I'm not sure that I'd say that.

644
00:34:18,897 --> 00:34:20,458
I would.

645
00:34:22,807 --> 00:34:25,130
What was I supposed to do, huh?

646
00:34:25,589 --> 00:34:28,008
Demand that he only love me?

647
00:34:29,759 --> 00:34:32,545
Scream at him to be a
less complicated person?

648
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,159
I mean, it's Quentin
we're talking about.

649
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:39,480
And I loved him.

650
00:34:41,645 --> 00:34:44,717
The real him, all of him.

651
00:34:47,569 --> 00:34:50,789
Well, um, there's something

652
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:52,201
he probably didn't tell you about.

653
00:34:52,202 --> 00:34:54,284
The mosaic.

654
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:59,664
Um, there was this timeline.

655
00:35:01,291 --> 00:35:05,571
We somehow remembered pieces of it,

656
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,776
but these, uh... these beautiful pieces,

657
00:35:07,777 --> 00:35:09,216
and it was...

658
00:35:09,799 --> 00:35:13,428
We loved each other for
a really, really long time,

659
00:35:13,429 --> 00:35:16,388
and, um, so,

660
00:35:16,389 --> 00:35:19,348
you know, uh, I promptly
told him to fuck off,

661
00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:22,539
and... and, you know,
he... he... he died for me.

662
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,778
Eliot.

663
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:37,160
Eliot, I have done...

664
00:35:40,447 --> 00:35:44,006
A lot of bad things, and I
have hurt people, okay?

665
00:35:44,007 --> 00:35:47,016
And the one thing that I
hold onto is that I know,

666
00:35:47,017 --> 00:35:49,836
deep down, that I was doing my best.

667
00:35:49,837 --> 00:35:52,984
Were you doing the best that you could?

668
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,178
Unfortunately at the time...

669
00:35:57,075 --> 00:35:58,223
Yes.

670
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:02,837
I never even got to talk to him again.

671
00:36:02,838 --> 00:36:04,896
He just died.

672
00:36:05,277 --> 00:36:07,807
I'm sorry.

673
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:10,957
Yeah, file it under
things I wish I could say

674
00:36:10,958 --> 00:36:13,717
in this fucking letter that
I can't actually send.

675
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,933
But I can't let go of it, either.

676
00:36:19,464 --> 00:36:21,770
You want my help?

677
00:36:25,792 --> 00:36:26,860
Yeah.

678
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:31,271
But we can do it together, okay?

679
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:32,816
Okay.

680
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:35,693
On the count of three.

681
00:36:37,194 --> 00:36:39,363
Okay.

682
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:42,224
- One.
- One.

683
00:36:42,229 --> 00:36:44,614
- Two.
- Two.

684
00:36:44,623 --> 00:36:46,034
Three.

685
00:36:55,908 --> 00:36:57,667
That was brave.

686
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:00,718
He was brave.

687
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,099
You were brave.

688
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:13,381
Eliot?

689
00:37:14,132 --> 00:37:15,442
Yeah?

690
00:37:15,452 --> 00:37:17,322
Thank you for telling me.

691
00:37:29,773 --> 00:37:32,733
Guards, hello! We're human again!

692
00:37:35,073 --> 00:37:36,132
Margo.

693
00:37:36,133 --> 00:37:38,142
Can I say one thing?

694
00:37:39,893 --> 00:37:42,844
I'm sorry I slept with Josh.

695
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:46,213
- We were just lonely.
- Fen, stop apologizing.

696
00:37:46,748 --> 00:37:50,710
I don't own Josh's penis,
and I don't want to.

697
00:37:52,462 --> 00:37:53,791
But you seem...

698
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:55,751
Can I have a complicated emotion

699
00:37:55,752 --> 00:37:59,172
without having to resolve
it so you can feel better?

700
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:04,483
I am grateful that even in
your complicated state,

701
00:38:04,484 --> 00:38:06,212
you still reached for
the Childsplay knife.

702
00:38:06,213 --> 00:38:09,589
- You're a good person...
- I thought it was a real knife.

703
00:38:11,884 --> 00:38:15,944
Glad it wasn't today,
but I'm not a good person.

704
00:38:16,319 --> 00:38:18,927
Okay, well,

705
00:38:18,931 --> 00:38:21,046
matters of the heart can be irrational

706
00:38:21,047 --> 00:38:22,466
and sometimes even the best of us...

707
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,596
Stop trying to forgive me.

708
00:38:24,597 --> 00:38:26,496
We want you to forgive us.

709
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,530
We promised ourselves we
wouldn't give up on you,

710
00:38:29,531 --> 00:38:31,160
but we did.

711
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:33,436
You never gave up on us.

712
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:34,840
Yeah, you figured out a way.

713
00:38:34,842 --> 00:38:36,965
Eliot sent the letter.

714
00:38:37,595 --> 00:38:39,763
I was gonna let you die
for Fillory, but...

715
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:43,388
Kings.

716
00:38:45,481 --> 00:38:46,933
We have a job,

717
00:38:47,475 --> 00:38:50,435
and we put it first, right?

718
00:38:51,795 --> 00:38:53,606
So...

719
00:38:54,745 --> 00:38:56,776
you didn't save us,

720
00:38:57,545 --> 00:38:59,056
and then you stabbed me.

721
00:39:00,975 --> 00:39:02,574
Am I a fool?

722
00:39:03,115 --> 00:39:04,304
No... no, really.

723
00:39:04,305 --> 00:39:06,271
- Am I?
- No more than me.

724
00:39:06,272 --> 00:39:07,689
You're a lovesick idiot!

725
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:10,765
- Hey!
- I went into battle for you

726
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:13,894
thinking that you gave a
single flea on a donkey's ass

727
00:39:13,895 --> 00:39:15,211
for any of us,

728
00:39:15,236 --> 00:39:17,796
thinking that we owed you something.

729
00:39:20,531 --> 00:39:21,615
Stupid me.

730
00:39:37,282 --> 00:39:40,320
I've been thinking about what Zoe said.

731
00:39:40,904 --> 00:39:42,786
It's a valid question.

732
00:39:42,787 --> 00:39:44,831
When do you save the world enough?

733
00:39:47,125 --> 00:39:49,124
Look, I'm... I'm with you on anything,

734
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:50,961
but I gotta be honest.

735
00:39:50,962 --> 00:39:52,432
If we survive this one,

736
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:54,209
I want a life, Julia.

737
00:39:54,918 --> 00:39:56,618
Ideally, with you.

738
00:39:56,619 --> 00:39:58,045
Yeah, I want that too.

739
00:39:58,046 --> 00:40:00,756
I'm not sure you do,
and tha... and that's okay.

740
00:40:00,757 --> 00:40:02,239
Right now we got shit to do,

741
00:40:02,243 --> 00:40:04,589
but if we don't die,

742
00:40:04,594 --> 00:40:05,928
we gotta figure this out.

743
00:40:08,549 --> 00:40:09,682
Hello.

744
00:40:10,259 --> 00:40:12,008
I solved your problem.

745
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:14,787
You were right. Surges are increasing.

746
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:15,796
They're unpredictable...

747
00:40:15,797 --> 00:40:17,791
hidden variables that defy calculation.

748
00:40:17,792 --> 00:40:19,586
But if we can't predict it...

749
00:40:19,587 --> 00:40:21,256
Correct. You can't.

750
00:40:21,257 --> 00:40:24,096
So instead, I created
a statistical model

751
00:40:24,097 --> 00:40:26,966
to predict a window within
which a surge might occur.

752
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:29,122
Wow.

753
00:40:29,123 --> 00:40:30,902
Okay, this is a start.

754
00:40:30,903 --> 00:40:33,162
Are you familiar with the
Harmonic Convergence?

755
00:40:33,163 --> 00:40:34,863
No.

756
00:40:34,873 --> 00:40:37,769
A rare and powerful
astrological occurrence.

757
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:39,186
A magnifier of magic.

758
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:40,509
There have been four.

759
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,149
Extinction of the dinosaurs,

760
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,369
Pompeii,

761
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:46,803
sinking of Atlantis, and the
invention of Auto-Tune.

762
00:40:47,345 --> 00:40:49,096
In two weeks, there will be a fifth.

763
00:40:49,472 --> 00:40:50,639
How bad will it be?

764
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,076
This is the event you're worried about.

765
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:54,506
Circumstances on the Convergence

766
00:40:54,512 --> 00:40:56,175
will be exceptionally favorable,

767
00:40:56,176 --> 00:40:59,035
which in this case is not a good thing,

768
00:40:59,036 --> 00:41:01,359
because it falls in a surge window.

769
00:41:01,846 --> 00:41:04,386
Castings will be
exponentially magnified.

770
00:41:04,392 --> 00:41:05,809
Enchantments will malfunction.

771
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:07,102
Death toll in the millions.

772
00:41:07,103 --> 00:41:08,979
- Maybe much higher.
- How can we stop it?

773
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:12,015
You can't, unless you stop the surges,

774
00:41:12,016 --> 00:41:13,304
change astrology,

775
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,596
or tell everyone on
Earth not to do magic.

776
00:41:15,597 --> 00:41:16,683
Whatever you try,

777
00:41:16,684 --> 00:41:18,726
if you need help, I will help you.

778
00:41:19,014 --> 00:41:20,519
And so will my sister.

779
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,480
I'm pretty sure she doesn't want to.

780
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,066
She doesn't, but if the moment comes,

781
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:27,849
you can count on the both of us.

782
00:41:27,851 --> 00:41:29,862
Wait. Dani.

783
00:41:29,863 --> 00:41:31,698
Thank you so much for your help.

784
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:33,787
My pleasure.

785
00:41:33,788 --> 00:41:36,268
My sister will invoice you for my time.

786
00:41:40,488 --> 00:41:44,078
Well, we go that-a-way.

787
00:41:44,085 --> 00:41:47,130
A tree near Whitespire can take us home.

788
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:51,009
I'm headed in that direction,
if you'd like some company.

789
00:41:51,902 --> 00:41:53,677
- Um, yeah.
- We wouldn't mind.

790
00:41:54,804 --> 00:41:56,514
Make way!

791
00:41:59,457 --> 00:42:01,500
Is that the Dark King's carriage?

792
00:42:04,124 --> 00:42:07,213
Are we in trouble again?

793
00:42:07,214 --> 00:42:08,733
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

794
00:42:25,408 --> 00:42:27,756
Would you like a ride to Whitespire?

795
00:42:28,581 --> 00:42:29,881
- Uh...
- I think we'll walk.

796
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:32,593
Um...

797
00:42:32,594 --> 00:42:36,014
I hope your journey gave you
everything that you needed.

798
00:42:36,846 --> 00:42:38,197
Please call on me

799
00:42:38,198 --> 00:42:40,535
if there's ever anything
I can do for you.

800
00:42:48,542 --> 00:42:50,127
He's...

801
00:42:52,246 --> 00:42:54,972
I think I almost fucked the Dark King.
