1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,731
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,836 --> 00:00:05,271
I will save the
people of Fillory.

3
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:11,545
The people would decide to
make this dark wizard their king.

4
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:12,977
The Dark King.

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,312
So, you built a
golem out of living clay

6
00:00:15,382 --> 00:00:18,318
<i>and then you animated the
whole thing with his essence?</i>

7
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:22,851
No, it's just a tiny grain of Q's soul
that I pulled from the Underworld.

8
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:26,515
Put back the piece of Q's essence
that you stole and let him be at rest.

9
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:28,354
Goodbye, Quentin.

10
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:31,589
Some surges come and go
and hardly anyone notices.

11
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,667
<i>And sometimes
it's a catastrophe.</i>

12
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:36,282
Is there any way
to predict them?

13
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:38,114
Look, I need help with
a metamath problem.

14
00:00:38,138 --> 00:00:44,237
My dad had a friend with a really rare
discipline, predicting circumstances.

15
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:45,344
She wrote this.

16
00:00:45,412 --> 00:00:47,074
Wait. I recognize these.

17
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:48,880
<i>Put them on a letter</i>

18
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:50,713
<i>address it to whoever, wherever,</i>

19
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:52,912
<i>whenever and it gets to them.</i>

20
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,242
<i>Because I want you to be safe.</i>

21
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,215
<i>I want you to be safe.</i>

22
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,889
Are you saying that
you... No, I'm just...

23
00:01:02,095 --> 00:01:05,031
We've tried the whole
"saving each other" thing,

24
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:06,625
with mixed results.

25
00:01:07,267 --> 00:01:09,736
Well, yeah, sure, but I...

26
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:13,968
And I've been thinking about
what works best, and I think...

27
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,943
No, I know that we're
best when we're a team,

28
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,941
and we work
together, you and me.

29
00:01:21,882 --> 00:01:23,510
If nothing else, I
like the sound of it.

30
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:29,789
Quentin?

31
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,624
Quentin.

32
00:01:59,653 --> 00:02:00,814
Oh, shit.

33
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:13,267
- Whoo! Yeah, there she is!
- Champagne for our girl.

34
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:16,568
High King Margo, a
thousand huzzahs!

35
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:17,964
Go, Bambi.

36
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:20,436
Um, why? We wanted to honor you.

37
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:24,575
So, when Julia sent us the bunny
saying that they put the clock in here,

38
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,273
we asked them to stock
up on celebratory beverages.

39
00:02:27,347 --> 00:02:28,827
Stay on the mission.
We're going back.

40
00:02:29,116 --> 00:02:31,642
Copy. Give me 30, we'll
have cookies to help brainstorm

41
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:33,352
how you're gonna
overthrow the Dark King.

42
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,289
Well, your subjects
are rightly grateful.

43
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,125
For sending that letter?

44
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:43,789
A.K.A. that thing I
totally didn't do, you did.

45
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:46,791
Why split a hair? Let
them bake cookies.

46
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:49,027
Lie cookies? It's not a lie.

47
00:02:49,336 --> 00:02:52,795
You saved them through me,
your advisor, acting on your behalf.

48
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:53,873
Nice retcon.

49
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:56,235
And as a wise king once said,

50
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,210
"Ovary up."

51
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:02,078
Let your subjects be inspired
by a simple, uncomplicated story.

52
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:03,983
That's what the people want.

53
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,049
Would you excuse me?

54
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,992
Where you going and why are
you dressed like a goth survivalist?

55
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,823
Fillory. Just quick.

56
00:03:20,901 --> 00:03:22,631
What you got there? Nothing.

57
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:27,870
I did a thing. This is a byproduct.
I just have to take care of it.

58
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:32,077
Alice, do you need help?
You seem a little bit distressed.

59
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:33,571
I'm fine.

60
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:35,476
I just have to do it alone.

61
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,677
Okay. Great. What was the spell?

62
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:40,018
I made a golem, okay?

63
00:03:40,087 --> 00:03:42,022
You've done it before.
It's not a big deal.

64
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:43,521
A golem of who?

65
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:45,919
Can we not be
dramatic about this?

66
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,696
I used his book
from the Library.

67
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,358
Quentin's? But I
was out of my mind.

68
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,854
And I didn't think that
this would just stay here

69
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,095
when I buried the golem,
and not be released.

70
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:02,868
It's Essence. It's a
tiny piece of his soul.

71
00:04:02,943 --> 00:04:06,209
I'm sorry. You pulled an actual
piece of Quentin's soul out of his...

72
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,273
That is insane. What if it's...
Keeping him from resting?

73
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,416
Well, is it?

74
00:04:10,517 --> 00:04:13,237
Look, I just need to get to the
top of this mountain and throw it in.

75
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,980
The Mountain Of Ghosts, that
Rupert Chatwin was looking for

76
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:18,888
before the band of aggressive
talking squirrels kidnapped him?

77
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:20,303
I'm finally reading the books.

78
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:22,125
Margo's been on my ass about it.

79
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:23,891
Anyway, is that it?

80
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:25,675
The one with the hole
at the top that goes all...

81
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,059
All the way down
to the Underworld?

82
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,767
Yes. Well, this
is too important.

83
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:31,871
I'm helping.

84
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,066
I don't need your help.
Well, you're getting it.

85
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:39,612
Fine.

86
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:03,060
Head hurt from the patch?

87
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:04,904
Uh...

88
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:06,437
Beats the noise.

89
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,172
Burning through them, though,

90
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:10,972
so looking for
some real answers.

91
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:14,678
None of these books is for shit.

92
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:17,514
Requested some from the Library,

93
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:19,813
but not getting the sense
they're gonna be that speedy.

94
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:24,682
So, while you're waiting...

95
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:27,988
God, that...

96
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:31,026
Always a great idea, but I
really do have a headache.

97
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:33,830
No. I need a ride.

98
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:39,128
Fine.

99
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,541
I've been thinking.
We should tell her.

100
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:51,516
Look, can we just concentrate
one thing at a time, please?

101
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:53,713
Let's just get her back
on the throne, huh?

102
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:56,549
Yeah, well, with those
banishment brands,

103
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:59,353
good luck getting her in the
kingdom, never mind the castle.

104
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:00,426
Oh, shit.

105
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:03,856
What month is it in
Fillory? Is it spring yet?

106
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,223
Yellow Ferret Month, yes.

107
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,567
Have you ever seen the
movie <i>The Dirty Dozen?</i>

108
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:09,668
Not the porn one.

109
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:11,568
No, and I have a
life, so summarize.

110
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:12,872
Uh, not important.

111
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:15,135
Point is, it inspired
me to do this thing

112
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,076
when the Taker attacks
were just starting.

113
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:22,676
We needed better guards, so I
created an annual tournament.

114
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:24,877
First week of the month
of the Yellow Ferret,

115
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:27,682
to find the 12 greatest
fighters in the land,

116
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:31,191
to become our elite
Centurion Guard.

117
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,292
Pretty cool name, right? Yeah.

118
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:36,028
Anyway, we offered fame, glory,

119
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:38,258
and instant wipe-clean
of your criminal record,

120
00:06:38,365 --> 00:06:40,994
including, uh-huh,
Banishment Marks.

121
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:43,579
And if they still hold the
tournament, it would be going on now,

122
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:44,627
as we speak.

123
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:47,274
We should check on that. No?

124
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:54,945
It's Living Stone, I think.

125
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,182
Hmm.

126
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,616
"Beware Takers."

127
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:01,711
"Beyond The Wall Adventure
Tours. 500 feet that way."

128
00:07:04,391 --> 00:07:06,724
Fill them. Rocks, lots of dust.

129
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:08,454
That'll be heavy.

130
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:11,562
Burns Takers.
They come at night.

131
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:13,290
We'll make a circle to camp in.

132
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,066
Or, hey, travel light,
if you want to die.

133
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:20,137
So, Takers. What
exactly are they?

134
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:22,300
You really don't know?

135
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,310
Nope.

136
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,944
Umber's tit. Don't
tell me you're grievers.

137
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:31,644
What's wrong with that?

138
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:33,649
You're not prepared
for the mountain.

139
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,914
You can't run fast because you've
been sitting around eating cake and crying.

140
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,791
Okay, I can grieve and handle a
little cardio, thank you very much.

141
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:42,860
Yeah, we're
Magicians. We'll be fine.

142
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:44,529
Don't say I didn't warn you.

143
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,624
You're planning to throw
something in at the top, keep it safe.

144
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:50,794
Takers don't just take people.

145
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,333
They know what thing
you value, and swipe it.

146
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,245
Alice.

147
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:05,647
This zips. It's the
safest thing we've got.

148
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,149
Alice, please let me take it.

149
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:10,949
Okay.

150
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,750
Come on.

151
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,329
Well, this stopped being fun.

152
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:57,813
Well, you wanted to come.

153
00:08:57,837 --> 00:08:59,931
Sure did. And it's awful.

154
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,474
Yeah, it's meant to be.

155
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:04,705
But maybe you don't feel that
way because it's not your pilgrimage.

156
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:08,471
What's that supposed to mean?

157
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,142
Nothing. Can we
please not bicker?

158
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,710
Sure. Let's not bicker.

159
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:16,723
What did you mean
by not my pilgrimage?

160
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:23,494
I mean I'm here putting my
boyfriend to rest, and you tagged along.

161
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:26,923
Right. Because I
barely knew him.

162
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,065
You know what I mean.

163
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:33,233
You're here out of some sort of
combination of thinking I'm incompetent

164
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,171
and your guilt that
he died saving you.

165
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,540
You know what?
You are way too smart

166
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,341
for me to ascribe what you
just said to total stupidity,

167
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,158
so I'm gonna go ahead
and I'm gonna file it under

168
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:44,174
"You must be fucking
joking right now."

169
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,912
No. I'm not.

170
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:50,448
This is hard enough without you
judging me every step of the way.

171
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:52,253
Is that how you don't bicker?

172
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,970
'Cause that would explain a lot
about how you and Q kept falling apart.

173
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:56,553
Beyond the obvious, of course.

174
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,257
The obvious? Yeah.

175
00:09:58,364 --> 00:10:00,299
What, like drunk threesomes
with you and Margo?

176
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,461
Oh, mmm, solid point, but I
was thinking more that one time

177
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,232
where you betrayed all of us,

178
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:08,070
I ended up possessed and
Q died cleaning up the mess.

179
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:14,142
And time for Yan
to roll a smoke.

180
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,281
That was a little harsh.

181
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:19,744
And correct.

182
00:10:20,854 --> 00:10:24,450
But not right. Because
he also saved my life.

183
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:25,958
Right.

184
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,588
Trying to fix the mess I made.

185
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,727
Here we are again.

186
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:37,727
Let's just finish this, okay?

187
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,809
Yan, let's go.

188
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,679
Finished with your feelings?

189
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:50,782
Yes.

190
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:53,519
Uh...

191
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:56,622
Alice, no, don't go that way.

192
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,966
Good luck and
enjoy the tournament.

193
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:13,334
Hello. I am Bick of the
esteemed House Pickwick.

194
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,498
Who is entering? Me.

195
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,166
Your name?

196
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:18,436
Janet. Janet.

197
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:19,670
Pluchinsky.

198
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:21,311
Weapon of choice?

199
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:23,976
Me. But also I like axes.

200
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:28,878
You are registered.

201
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:30,442
Proceed... I'm entering too.

202
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:34,059
I just want to.

203
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:37,663
My name's Fen... cicle.

204
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:40,056
Wahlburger.

205
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,834
Weapon of choice? Knives.

206
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,938
I choose to use my
Childsplay knives.

207
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:49,538
The kind of knives they
give to very young children.

208
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,510
Wow.

209
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:53,873
You had some kinda childhood.

210
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:56,949
Hmm.

211
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:02,548
Okay, so I found you this.

212
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:04,920
Fuck my life. Or I can
get you something else.

213
00:12:05,024 --> 00:12:08,256
I just tried to do Singh's Advanced
Skin Hardening twice, and touch me.

214
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,094
Smooth and perfect.

215
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:14,429
And I'm getting eaten alive by
whimsical goddamn Fillorian bugs.

216
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,293
Huh. Um...

217
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:18,195
You know what?

218
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:20,831
You just keep practicing
that shield casting,

219
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:24,309
and I'm, uh, gonna go check
on something real quick.

220
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:37,762
Do we even have an appointment?

221
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:38,984
What do you think?

222
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:48,331
What the hell just happened?

223
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,229
Where are we?

224
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,403
Um, excuse me. Is
this P.K. Endeavors?

225
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:54,873
These two look confused.

226
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:58,036
Hi. Zoe Markus. I run the
joint. Julia Wicker. We emailed.

227
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,612
Hey, why does this place look
exactly like the Physical Kids' Cottage?

228
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:03,443
You went to Brakebills?

229
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:06,117
I'm a professor at Brakebills.

230
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,447
Really?

231
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:11,582
Brakebills. Best
years of my life.

232
00:13:12,725 --> 00:13:13,886
Hence, I did a study.

233
00:13:14,427 --> 00:13:18,091
Most Magicians cast 23% more
accurately when they've been drinking.

234
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:20,258
God, we're fucked.

235
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:24,970
So, what can I help you
with? Stocks, you said?

236
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:28,530
I did say that. We were hoping
to talk to your sister Daniella.

237
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,641
How come?

238
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:32,672
Well, to start, you know
how magic was regulated?

239
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,304
Until it wasn't, thank God.

240
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,143
Well, we stopped
that, and a lot worse.

241
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:40,815
A friend of ours did. But
there were side effects.

242
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,952
Like the surges. Which
are... Getting stronger.

243
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,827
We're concerned we're
heading towards a major event.

244
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:50,962
And you need... Daniella,

245
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,623
to predict when
it's going to happen.

246
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:55,400
We'll pay what we can.

247
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:59,564
Zoe, you and your sister would
be helping to save the world.

248
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,970
I'd love to help. Great.

249
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:06,004
But, unfortunately,
I must decline.

250
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:07,412
Please. Wait.

251
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,813
Stay as long as
you like. Wait. Shit.

252
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:13,311
Shit.

253
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:16,116
It's okay. We'll figure
something out. Come on.

254
00:14:24,997 --> 00:14:27,660
Okay, so I got some
kinda bad news.

255
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:31,704
Fillory has two moons. And
if either is full, then wolf time.

256
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:34,501
So one of them's full soon?
Both are. Tomorrow night.

257
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:37,567
Which is why your wolf PMS
is acting so bad right now.

258
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:39,270
I'm about to be a
double werewolf?

259
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,440
It's okay, because there's
still cages. I checked.

260
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,881
So it's totally
fine. It's not fine.

261
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,008
You're doing great.

262
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:49,021
No. The skin-hardening
spell I keep trying to cast

263
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:52,422
so I don't get flayed alive only
stuck to the left half of my body,

264
00:14:52,525 --> 00:14:56,360
and also, I want to
murder everything.

265
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:57,562
Oh! Um...

266
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,600
More than usual? Yes, in fact.

267
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,228
Well, maybe just some deep
breaths, and, you know, you got this.

268
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:05,414
So... Fuck breathing.

269
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:06,736
I'm too annoyed to breathe.

270
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,437
But I like you, anyway.

271
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,212
Thanks for the
cheerleading, wolf boy.

272
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:15,874
Uh...

273
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,079
Of course. That's fine.

274
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:23,322
The air's so thin up here,
I think I'm hallucinating.

275
00:15:28,194 --> 00:15:30,254
We're gonna need to
rest before we go again.

276
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:32,457
I just wanna pin
the circle in place.

277
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:41,306
Eliot?

278
00:15:50,116 --> 00:15:51,209
Hey, Eliot.

279
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,148
Okay, just...

280
00:16:03,329 --> 00:16:04,422
Okay.

281
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,399
Eliot, Taker! Back up.

282
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,536
Q's vial, you set it down.

283
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,606
Fuck. Just stay in the circle.

284
00:16:15,408 --> 00:16:16,535
Eliot, no!

285
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:31,423
Fuck.

286
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:22,031
You all right?

287
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,178
I'm really glad I
took the north trail.

288
00:17:26,946 --> 00:17:28,346
Pretty sure I'm gladder.

289
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:30,682
Who needs a drink?

290
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:39,215
Sorry. Are you still...

291
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,951
Yeah, no, we're
just about done here.

292
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:43,695
Any luck?

293
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,724
Zoe definitely went
here in the '90s,

294
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:47,958
but her professors don't
seem to remember her.

295
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:50,764
She did a lot of field
work in Poland, I guess.

296
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,429
Zoe Markus?

297
00:17:52,972 --> 00:17:54,440
Yeah. Do you know her?

298
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:57,603
She was my lab partner.

299
00:17:58,277 --> 00:18:00,041
Oh, my God, we dropped
so much acid together.

300
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:04,943
We went to visit her work.
She's a big financial advisor.

301
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:06,184
Seriously?

302
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:10,054
Wow. I mean, she was
really not into money at all

303
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,556
when I knew her and her sisters.

304
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:12,791
Sisters?

305
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:14,592
More than one? Yeah.

306
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,789
Beth, Zoe and Dani,
who, no offense, is...

307
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:19,297
little weird.

308
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:22,600
Rumor has it that they averted
apocalypse in senior year.

309
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:39,584
Good.

310
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:44,913
Janet of House Pluchinsky.

311
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,387
Yeah!

312
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:49,793
Versus Faun of House
Caicos Swordmasters.

313
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:51,496
Yeah!

314
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:57,937
Whoo!

315
00:19:01,207 --> 00:19:04,200
Fencicle of House Wahlburger.

316
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,821
What?

317
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,120
Whoa!

318
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:51,849
Yeah.

319
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:05,504
God damn. We've
been wasting her, right?

320
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:06,882
This is like spy movie perfect.

321
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:08,146
You're both in <i>The Dirty Dozen,</i>

322
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,539
and I'm the guy on the outside.

323
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:11,907
Victors, please
approach the dais.

324
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:14,508
Congratulations.

325
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:21,047
Fencicle, what is
your persuasion?

326
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,917
Uh, I mostly date humans.

327
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,214
Are you a female?

328
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:28,219
And you, Janet?

329
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:29,418
Duh.

330
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:32,893
There can, of course, only
be one female Centurion.

331
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:35,100
And act three twist.

332
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,127
For all the obvious reasons...

333
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,261
Um, not obvious to me.

334
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,738
I know, dear. That's
one of the reasons.

335
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:46,410
You spar by the light of the
glorious double full moon,

336
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:47,512
tomorrow night.

337
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,247
Tomorrow night? That's
no good. I've got plans.

338
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:51,682
Me too. I mean...

339
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,747
Oh, gravest apologies,
but the schedule...

340
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:59,150
Chucklebuddy, I have a
sexually transmitted curse.

341
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,417
Sun goes down
tomorrow, I go wolf.

342
00:21:01,727 --> 00:21:03,127
This guy goes wolf... Hi.

343
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:06,460
Ember's balls.

344
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:10,631
And her, too, for some reason.

345
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:15,240
That what you want here?
Sure to be entertaining.

346
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,942
Probably be everyone
in here's last show.

347
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,342
Reschedule the mimes. Yes, sir.

348
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:29,285
Your match will occur in the
hour before sundown tomorrow.

349
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:39,156
Margo, Josh and I
only... Six or seven,

350
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:42,166
or less than a dozen
times, give or take,

351
00:21:42,268 --> 00:21:44,499
and we would've never,
ever done it if we had known...

352
00:21:44,603 --> 00:21:45,730
Excuse me.

353
00:21:46,906 --> 00:21:48,807
I need to sharpen my axe.

354
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:52,443
Well...

355
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,114
Please say something
nice at my funeral.

356
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:01,618
So, Loria.

357
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:06,086
I was making ends
meet selling rare objects.

358
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:08,927
Of course, when I got
there I mostly drank.

359
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,601
I think this story is
making me sound

360
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:13,394
much less mentally
well-composed than I actually am.

361
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,764
We're literally camping
on the Sadderhorn.

362
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:21,106
Anyway, I was at the border
when I saw my first Taker.

363
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:22,502
That thing you did.

364
00:22:23,108 --> 00:22:26,636
I tried to throw something
at one earlier, and nothing.

365
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:28,471
Well, most things don't work.

366
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:30,409
Well, the Dark King
can fend them off.

367
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:33,977
There are a few of us out
here who have figured out ways.

368
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:36,784
How? When it touched me,

369
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,848
it felt like a virus, a plague.

370
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:42,551
I shot something off on
instinct, uh, an antiviral...

371
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:44,592
You're a Magician from Earth?

372
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:46,488
My family is.

373
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,599
Do you think you can
show us what you did?

374
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:52,137
I will teach you whatever I can.

375
00:22:52,338 --> 00:22:55,433
And something
else I can share...

376
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,200
Lucky that the
Taker didn't snatch it.

377
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:00,705
Thank you.

378
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,842
Is that Lorian Bumble Wine?

379
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:04,076
Ah-ha.

380
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:08,984
Cures altitude sickness, opens
the lungs, and gets you smashed.

381
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:11,867
Wait. I was gonna...

382
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,757
I was gonna say you
should go easy on that.

383
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:14,985
Oh, my God.

384
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,825
It's too late now. I'm sorry.

385
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,058
Well, cheers to that.

386
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,765
You're a danger tourist? No.

387
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:28,068
Mourning someone.

388
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:32,037
Who was it? I mean,
if you wanna say.

389
00:23:32,645 --> 00:23:33,772
Well...

390
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:38,582
The love of my life.
Died ridiculously young.

391
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:40,051
But he was a Magician.

392
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:41,917
And there's nothing
more dangerous than that.

393
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:46,650
My dreams were so filled with him, I
was convinced he was haunting me.

394
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:52,460
So, I took his diary up to the
top of the mountain and threw it in.

395
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,567
Felt a little better,
so who knows?

396
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:01,607
But you're here again.
I come every year.

397
00:24:02,408 --> 00:24:04,570
To honor him. My boyfriend died.

398
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:08,210
A little bit
on-and-off-again. It was...

399
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,843
Well, it was complicated.

400
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:11,907
I don't like talking about it.

401
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:14,379
I understand.

402
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,653
You knew him, too?

403
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,126
Um...

404
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:24,156
Good friend.

405
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,229
It's nice that you
can do this together.

406
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,129
Yes. Cheers to that, too.

407
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:38,001
Well, I think I should start thinking
about going to lie down, so...

408
00:24:38,277 --> 00:24:39,711
My eggs are scrambled.

409
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:40,836
They sure are.

410
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:49,454
Hi. Daniella?

411
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:52,953
Awkward.

412
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:55,092
Um, we didn't mean to scare you.

413
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,871
We just wanted to talk to
you and your sister about...

414
00:24:56,895 --> 00:25:00,024
What the hell are you doing?
I told you, we can't help you.

415
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:01,532
You can, but you won't.

416
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:04,569
Hey, look, we're not
asking you to join the fight.

417
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,670
We just need your help
with the... It's not "just."

418
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,565
You think she'll stop? If
she knows the stakes?

419
00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:11,867
Tell me about
the problem. Don't.

420
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:13,878
Unless you want to explain
how obsessed you get,

421
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:17,438
how you nearly got yourself
killed, how Beth did get killed.

422
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:21,852
Look, we're sorry. I'm not.

423
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:25,486
Look, I get that you've
lost a lot. But so have we.

424
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:28,059
We need your help.
I'm just saying...

425
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,992
We already saved
the world. Okay?

426
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:32,355
We get to be done.

427
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:35,567
Get out. Don't come back.

428
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:43,071
There's nothing like
two grieving lunatics

429
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:47,039
drinking themselves to
death on a mountain of ghosts.

430
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:49,073
Cheers.

431
00:25:49,181 --> 00:25:50,181
Hmm.

432
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,048
Oh, it's a good sky tonight.

433
00:25:56,922 --> 00:25:57,922
Please.

434
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:10,802
Used to do this with him.

435
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:14,903
We'd go somewhere, camp out,

436
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:19,973
and use illusion magic to
change the color of the stars.

437
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,414
Sounds perfect.

438
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:33,658
Have you ever had love?

439
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:40,790
Love. Uh, like...

440
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:43,993
Love. It's okay. You
can say anything.

441
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:46,465
I'm a stranger and you're drunk.

442
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,774
The friend we're
putting to rest...

443
00:26:56,582 --> 00:26:57,743
Wasn't just a friend.

444
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:00,985
Does she know?

445
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,187
Oh, God, no.

446
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:06,122
A torrid secret affair.

447
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:07,586
Nothing like that.

448
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:10,027
Hmm.

449
00:27:10,262 --> 00:27:11,457
It seems a bit selfish then.

450
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:15,662
I'm just saying, that seems
rather important information

451
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:17,860
that he can't give her.

452
00:27:19,438 --> 00:27:22,101
I mean, why punish her
like that? Why spare her?

453
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,441
You don't seem close.

454
00:27:25,777 --> 00:27:28,804
Because she really,
really loved him.

455
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:29,974
So did you.

456
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,452
Yeah. So I don't
want her to think that...

457
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:35,317
Have you ever noticed

458
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,117
that people generally think
what the hell they want?

459
00:27:38,891 --> 00:27:41,451
I'm starting to think that
you're a little bit of a shit-stirrer.

460
00:27:44,963 --> 00:27:46,829
I just fundamentally
believe that

461
00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:48,367
the best way to honor someone

462
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:49,628
is with the truth of them.

463
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:53,501
You could give her more
of that truth, but you won't.

464
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:56,200
I just want everybody to remember
Quentin however they want to,

465
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:58,334
and to get through
the fucking day.

466
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,445
I'm just pointing out,

467
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,472
what you've got in
that secret pocket

468
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,349
could help her remember

469
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:06,679
the real Quentin.

470
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:19,226
Death is so simple and
life is so complicated.

471
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:22,033
I know.

472
00:28:28,941 --> 00:28:29,941
Well...

473
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:32,676
I should go to bed.

474
00:28:34,246 --> 00:28:36,340
Before things get
any more complicated.

475
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:53,732
Years ago, the Dark King,
in a show of progressiveness,

476
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:58,230
allowed that there might be a
female among his Centurions,

477
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:00,499
if one proved worthy.

478
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,603
This year,

479
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:06,409
we have two competitors
of the weaker sex.

480
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:08,946
I know, I know.

481
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:10,739
Or you could walk away.

482
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,679
Can't. This is for Fillory.

483
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:15,079
You're a little wolf-crazy
right now, and mad.

484
00:29:15,153 --> 00:29:16,314
You might actually kill her.

485
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,219
I know how to properly
lightly maim someone.

486
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,690
Thanks for your concern.

487
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,986
Janet, Fencicle, let
the battle commence!

488
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:32,499
You smell anxious.

489
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,904
And you smell angry,
so please let me stab you.

490
00:29:35,974 --> 00:29:38,500
You are out of your
mind. Margo, please.

491
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:41,946
Actually worked.

492
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:43,811
That's no fair, 'cause
you can do magic.

493
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:46,612
You can do that twirly
knife shit. You have an axe.

494
00:29:46,718 --> 00:29:48,482
Fine. No magic.

495
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:03,734
Magic.

496
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:05,062
Oops.

497
00:30:22,321 --> 00:30:25,314
We have a victor!
A... A victorette!

498
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:31,355
Your new lady Centurion!

499
00:30:33,965 --> 00:30:35,763
I'm so sorry, Fen.

500
00:30:39,805 --> 00:30:40,805
What?

501
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:42,406
What?

502
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:47,313
That was so well-played.

503
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:50,338
How you knew to grab my knife.

504
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:52,311
Did I know that?

505
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,362
Of course you did.
Childsplay knife, perfectly safe.

506
00:30:54,386 --> 00:30:56,226
We make them for
children so they can practice.

507
00:30:57,823 --> 00:30:58,823
Oh.

508
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:03,692
Sir, can you please bring us to the
werewolf cages? Quickly? Thanks.

509
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,237
I think I'll take the east view.

510
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:21,579
I'll find you later if you
wanna hike down together.

511
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:45,362
I'll just give you a moment.

512
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:47,933
No. Stay.

513
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,878
You cared about him, too.

514
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:03,653
Do you think it goes all the
way down to the Underworld?

515
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:06,657
I hope so. For Q.

516
00:32:15,801 --> 00:32:17,401
Is there anything you
want to say to him?

517
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:30,381
Rest.

518
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:38,246
Okay. I think we can go now.

519
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:41,921
Wait. There's one more thing.

520
00:32:42,928 --> 00:32:43,928
Uh...

521
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,064
Wait. This stamp is enchanted.

522
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,840
You could send this to him.

523
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:03,113
Mmm-hmm.

524
00:33:03,181 --> 00:33:05,844
Before... Oh, my God. Eliot.

525
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,764
But you didn't send it 'cause
you were worried it could be...

526
00:33:09,788 --> 00:33:11,120
So much worse if I changed it.

527
00:33:14,125 --> 00:33:15,616
Uh, Alice...

528
00:33:16,261 --> 00:33:17,261
Huh?

529
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:20,858
Is there a way that we
could really, truly know?

530
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:23,897
Eliot, I really don't know.

531
00:33:27,272 --> 00:33:28,272
It's...

532
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:31,469
Sometimes I just wish, if you
all just went faster. If you just...

533
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:35,170
Just locked the fucking door.

534
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,476
No, because
Everett would still...

535
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:39,550
It's Everett, of course.

536
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:42,278
Q...

537
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:45,014
If Q hadn't stopped
Everett, then...

538
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,218
So many more people could die.

539
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:48,888
But I just keep thinking

540
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:51,691
if I can just crack the
code, then we can fix it.

541
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:54,460
I don't think there's a perfect
code for changing the past.

542
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:56,899
I can't send it.

543
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:59,930
But I... I can't just let it go.

544
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:01,865
It's okay.

545
00:34:03,008 --> 00:34:04,008
He was your friend.

546
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:06,743
He wasn't just my friend.

547
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:17,614
I'm sorry.

548
00:34:20,025 --> 00:34:21,391
He loved you.

549
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,205
Why would I want to take
that away from you now?

550
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:25,629
That would be so cruel.

551
00:34:27,365 --> 00:34:29,425
Do you really think I didn't
know there was more?

552
00:34:35,874 --> 00:34:37,604
I knew Q really well.

553
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:41,371
And if anyone was
messy, it was him.

554
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:44,909
Yeah. Yeah.

555
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:48,584
He was pretty in love with you.

556
00:34:51,356 --> 00:34:53,791
I'm not sure that
I'd say that. I would.

557
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:58,687
What was I supposed to do, huh?

558
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:02,066
Demand that he only love me?

559
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:06,732
Scream at him to be a
less complicated person?

560
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:09,230
I mean, it's Quentin
we're talking about.

561
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:13,745
And I loved him.

562
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:19,141
The real him. All of him.

563
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,547
Well, um...

564
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:26,717
There's something he
probably didn't tell you about.

565
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:28,456
The mosaic.

566
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:31,996
Um...

567
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,557
There was this timeline.

568
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:40,461
We somehow
remembered pieces of it.

569
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:42,837
These, uh... These
beautiful pieces.

570
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:44,204
And it was so...

571
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:48,578
We loved each other for
a really, really long time.

572
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:50,574
And, um...

573
00:35:51,116 --> 00:35:54,746
So, you know, uh, I
promptly told him to fuck off,

574
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,812
and then, you
know, he died for me.

575
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:07,197
Eliot.

576
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:10,534
Eliot...

577
00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:13,135
I have done

578
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:19,667
a lot of bad things, and I
have hurt people, okay?

579
00:36:19,778 --> 00:36:21,906
And the one thing
that I hold on to

580
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:25,177
is that I know deep down
that I was doing my best.

581
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:28,252
Were you doing the
best that you could?

582
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,053
Unfortunately, at the time,

583
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,191
yes.

584
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:40,855
I never even got to talk
to him again. He just died.

585
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,063
I'm sorry.

586
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:45,794
Yeah. File it under

587
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:49,838
"Things I wish I could say in this
fucking letter that I can't actually send."

588
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,570
But I can't let go of it either.

589
00:36:56,081 --> 00:36:57,515
You want my help?

590
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:03,854
Yeah.

591
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,923
But we can do it together, okay?

592
00:37:09,861 --> 00:37:11,261
On the count of three.

593
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:18,727
One... One...

594
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:21,034
Two... Two...

595
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:22,773
Three.

596
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:34,445
That was brave.

597
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:37,582
He was brave.

598
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:39,618
You are brave.

599
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:51,034
Eliot?

600
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,070
Yeah?

601
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:54,731
Thank you for telling me.

602
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:09,620
Guards! Hello!
We're human again!

603
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:13,481
Margo?

604
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:15,321
Can I say one thing?

605
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:20,124
I'm sorry I slept with Josh.

606
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:23,665
We were just lonely.
Fen, stop apologizing.

607
00:38:24,836 --> 00:38:27,772
I don't own Josh's
penis and I don't want to.

608
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:31,365
But you seem...

609
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:33,478
Can I have a
complicated emotion,

610
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:36,805
without having to resolve
it so you can feel better?

611
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:42,285
I am grateful that even
in your complicated state,

612
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:44,117
you still reached for
the Childsplay knife.

613
00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:47,490
You're a good person. I
thought it was a real knife.

614
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:53,825
Glad it wasn't today,
but I'm not a good person.

615
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:55,793
Okay, well,

616
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:59,161
matters of the heart
can be irrational,

617
00:38:59,237 --> 00:39:00,671
and sometimes
even the best of us...

618
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:02,673
Stop trying to forgive me.

619
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:04,676
We want you to forgive us.

620
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:09,640
We promised ourselves we
wouldn't give up on you, but we did.

621
00:39:10,215 --> 00:39:11,342
You never gave up on us.

622
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,712
Yeah, you figured out a
way. Eliot sent the letter.

623
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:18,379
I was gonna let
you die for Fillory.

624
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:22,320
But kings...

625
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:29,164
We have a job and
we put it first. Right?

626
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:35,500
So, you didn't save us,

627
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,138
and then you stabbed me.

628
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:41,569
Am I a fool?

629
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,042
No, really. Am I?

630
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:45,415
No more than me.

631
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:47,417
You're a lovesick idiot! Hey.

632
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,884
I went into battle for you.

633
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,358
Thinking that you gave a
single flea on a donkey's ass

634
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:54,551
for any of us.

635
00:39:55,193 --> 00:39:57,560
Thinking that we
owed you something.

636
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:01,359
Stupid me.

637
00:40:17,382 --> 00:40:20,113
I've been thinking
about what Zoe said.

638
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,584
It's a valid question.

639
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:24,780
When do you save
the world enough?

640
00:40:27,492 --> 00:40:29,120
Look, I'm with you on anything,

641
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:31,025
but I gotta be honest.

642
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:32,561
If we survive this one,

643
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,360
I want a life, Julia.

644
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,661
Ideally with you.

645
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:38,666
Yeah, I want that, too.

646
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,239
I'm not sure you
do, and that's okay.

647
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:44,499
Right now we got shit
to do. But if we don't die,

648
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,402
we gotta figure this out.

649
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,304
Hello.

650
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,378
I solved your problem.

651
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:55,452
You were right.
Surges are increasing.

652
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:58,522
They're unpredictable, hidden
variables that defy calculation.

653
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:01,690
But if we can't predict
it... Correct. You can't.

654
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:04,824
So instead, I created
a statistical model

655
00:41:05,063 --> 00:41:07,658
to predict a window within
which a surge might occur.

656
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:10,393
Wow.

657
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,800
Okay, this is a start.

658
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:14,299
Are you familiar with the
Harmonic Convergence?

659
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:16,073
No.

660
00:41:16,341 --> 00:41:18,970
A rare and powerful
astrological occurrence.

661
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:20,643
A magnifier of magic.

662
00:41:20,712 --> 00:41:23,443
There have been four.
Extinction of the dinosaurs,

663
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:26,277
Pompeii, sinking of Atlantis,

664
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:28,091
and the invention of Auto-Tune.

665
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:30,653
In two weeks,
there will be a fifth.

666
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:34,490
How bad will it be? This is
the event you're worried about.

667
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,317
Circumstances on the Convergence

668
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:37,952
will be exceptionally favorable.

669
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:40,328
Which, in this case,
is not a good thing,

670
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:42,524
because it falls
in a surge window.

671
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:46,096
Castings will be
exponentially magnified.

672
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,638
Enchantments will malfunction.

673
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,901
Death toll in the millions.
Maybe much higher.

674
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:51,704
How can we stop it? You can't.

675
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,173
Unless you stop the
surges. Change astrology.

676
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,508
Or tell everyone on
Earth not to do magic.

677
00:41:57,715 --> 00:42:00,344
Whatever you try, if you
need help, I will help you.

678
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:02,511
And so will my sister.

679
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,553
I'm pretty sure
she doesn't want to.

680
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:05,815
She doesn't.

681
00:42:06,224 --> 00:42:09,922
But if the moment comes,
you can count on the both of us.

682
00:42:10,228 --> 00:42:11,491
Wait, Dani.

683
00:42:12,397 --> 00:42:15,026
Thank you so much for
your help. My pleasure.

684
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,400
My sister will invoice
you for my time.

685
00:42:22,607 --> 00:42:23,607
Well...

686
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:26,402
We go thataway.

687
00:42:28,146 --> 00:42:29,671
Tree near Whitespire
can take us home.

688
00:42:30,148 --> 00:42:33,607
I'm headed in that direction,
if you'd like some company.

689
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,082
We wouldn't mind. Yeah.

690
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:39,485
Make way!

691
00:42:42,627 --> 00:42:44,528
Is that the Dark
King's carriage?

692
00:42:47,932 --> 00:42:50,060
Are we in trouble again?

693
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:51,964
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

694
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:11,079
Would you like a
ride to Whitespire?

695
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:13,451
I think we'll walk.

696
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,583
Um...

697
00:43:16,394 --> 00:43:18,989
I hope your journey gave you
everything that you needed.

698
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:21,960
Please call on me

699
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:24,001
if there's ever anything
I can do for you.

700
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:33,944
He's...

701
00:43:36,814 --> 00:43:38,840
I think I almost
fucked the Dark King.
