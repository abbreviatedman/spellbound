1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,779
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,343
I will save the people of Fillory.

3
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:14,379
The people would decide

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,432
to make this dark wizard their king,

5
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,393
the Dark King.

6
00:00:18,394 --> 00:00:20,436
So you built a golem out of living clay,

7
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,159
and then you animated the whole thing

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,600
with his essence?

9
00:00:23,607 --> 00:00:26,479
No, it's just a tiny grain of Q's soul

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,899
that I pulled from the Underworld.

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,379
Put back the piece of Q's
essence that you stole

12
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,573
and let him be at rest.

13
00:00:31,574 --> 00:00:33,529
Good-bye, Quentin.

14
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,160
Some surges come and go

15
00:00:35,165 --> 00:00:36,661
and hardly anyone notices.

16
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:39,789
And sometimes it's a catastrophe.

17
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:41,291
Is there any way to predict them?

18
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:42,909
Look, I need help with
a metamath problem.

19
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,299
My dad had a friend

20
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,610
with a really rare discipline,

21
00:00:47,612 --> 00:00:49,260
predicting circumstances.

22
00:00:49,266 --> 00:00:50,466
- _
- She wrote this.

23
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,176
Wait. I recognize these.

24
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,970
Put 'em on a letter,

25
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:55,806
address it to whoever, wherever,

26
00:00:55,807 --> 00:00:58,684
whenever, and it gets to them.

27
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,760
Because I want you to be safe.

28
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:04,549
I want you to be safe.

29
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,999
- Are you saying that you...
- No, I'm just...

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,590
we've tried the whole
"saving each other" thing

31
00:01:09,591 --> 00:01:11,720
with mixed results.

32
00:01:11,723 --> 00:01:13,590
Yeah.

33
00:01:13,595 --> 00:01:15,069
Sure, but I...

34
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,040
And I've been thinking
about what works best,

35
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,879
and I think... no, I know...

36
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,759
that we're best when we're a team

37
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,044
and we work together, you and me.

38
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,540
If nothing else, I like the sound of it.

39
00:01:33,702 --> 00:01:35,553
Quentin?

40
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:36,830
Quentin!

41
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,960
_

42
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,580
_

43
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,120
_

44
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,560
_

45
00:02:04,646 --> 00:02:05,909
Oh, shit.

46
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,939
Whoo, yeah! There she is!

47
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,680
- Champagne for our girl!
- Whoo!

48
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:21,557
High King Margo, a thousand huzzahs!

49
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,227
- Go, Bambi.
- Um, why?

50
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:25,603
We wanted to honor you,

51
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:27,272
so when Julia sent us the bunny

52
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:30,119
saying that they put the clock in here,

53
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,279
we asked them to stock up
on celebratory beverages.

54
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,861
Stay on mission. We're going back.

55
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,319
Copy. Give me 30.

56
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,439
We'll have cookies to help brainstorm

57
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,283
how you're gonna
overthrow the Dark King.

58
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:44,331
Well, your subjects
are rightly grateful.

59
00:02:44,332 --> 00:02:46,199
For sending that letter?

60
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,099
A.K.A. that thing I totally didn't do.

61
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,139
You did.

62
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,329
Why split a hair?

63
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,829
Let them bake cookies.

64
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:54,215
- Lie cookies?
- It's not a lie.

65
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:56,509
You saved them through me, your advisor,

66
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,879
acting on your behalf.

67
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,970
Nice retcon.

68
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:01,789
Then as a wise king once said,

69
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,266
ovary up.

70
00:03:03,267 --> 00:03:04,892
Let your subjects be inspired

71
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,440
by a simple, uncomplicated story.

72
00:03:07,448 --> 00:03:09,030
That's what the people want.

73
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:18,282
Would you excuse me?

74
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:22,869
Where are you going,
and why are you dressed

75
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,121
like a goth survivalist?

76
00:03:24,122 --> 00:03:25,839
Fillory, just quick.

77
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,125
- What you got there?
- Nothing.

78
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,640
I did a thing. This is a byproduct.

79
00:03:31,646 --> 00:03:32,921
I just have to take care of it.

80
00:03:32,922 --> 00:03:35,479
Alice, do you need help?

81
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,176
You seem a little bit distressed.

82
00:03:37,177 --> 00:03:38,799
I'm fine.

83
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,519
I just have to do it alone.

84
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,848
Okay, great. What was the spell?

85
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,099
I made a golem, okay?

86
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,960
You've done it before.
It's not a big deal.

87
00:03:46,965 --> 00:03:48,679
A golem of who?

88
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,019
Can we... can we not be
dramatic about this?

89
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,859
I used his book from the Library.

90
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,399
- Quentin's?
- But I was out of my mind,

91
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,695
and I didn't think that
this would just stay here

92
00:04:00,696 --> 00:04:03,160
when I buried the golem
and not be released.

93
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,450
It's Essence.

94
00:04:06,455 --> 00:04:07,979
It's a tiny piece of his soul.

95
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,500
I'm sorry, you pulled an
actual piece of Quentin's soul

96
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:12,809
out of his... that is insane.

97
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,421
- What if it's...
- Keeping him from resting?

98
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:16,559
- Well, is it?
- I just need to get

99
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,299
to the top of this
mountain and throw it in.

100
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,509
The Mountain of Ghosts

101
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,080
that Rupert Chatwin was looking for

102
00:04:21,086 --> 00:04:22,469
before the band of aggressive

103
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,130
talking squirrels kidnapped him?

104
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:25,348
I'm finally reading the books.

105
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:27,225
Margo has been on my ass about it.

106
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:29,049
Anyway, is that it?

107
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,620
The one with the hole
at the top that goes...

108
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,030
All the way down to the Underworld?

109
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,150
- Yes.
- Well, this is too important.

110
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,100
- I'm helping.
- I don't need your help.

111
00:04:38,103 --> 00:04:39,111
Well, you're getting it.

112
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,700
Fine.

113
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,711
- Synced & corrected by<font color="#E83286"> MementMori </font>-
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.addic7ed.com</font> --

114
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,829
Head hurt from the patch?

115
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:12,179
Uh, it beats the noise.

116
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,699
Burning through them, though,

117
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,179
so looking for some real answers.

118
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,679
None of these books is for shit.

119
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,499
Requested some from the Library
but not getting the sense

120
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,325
they're gonna be that speedy.

121
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:30,620
So, while you're waiting...

122
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,459
God, that... always a great idea,

123
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,120
but I really do have a headache.

124
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:38,881
No, I need a ride.

125
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,160
Fine.

126
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:53,644
I've been thinking, we should tell her.

127
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:56,604
Look, can we just concentrate
one thing at a time, please?

128
00:05:56,605 --> 00:05:58,879
Let's just get her back
on the throne, huh?

129
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,620
Yeah, well, with those
banishment brands,

130
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,010
good luck getting her in the kingdom,

131
00:06:03,014 --> 00:06:04,839
never mind the castle.

132
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,279
Oh, shit.

133
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,909
What month is it in Fillory?

134
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,519
Is it spring yet?

135
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,662
Yellow Ferret Month, yes.

136
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,540
Have you ever seen the
movie "The Dirty Dozen"?

137
00:06:13,547 --> 00:06:14,749
Not the porn one.

138
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,664
No, and I have a life, so summarize.

139
00:06:16,665 --> 00:06:17,760
Uh, not important.

140
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:20,119
Point is, it inspired
me to do this thing

141
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,119
when the Taker attacks
were just starting.

142
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,019
We needed better guards,

143
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,119
so I created an annual tournament.

144
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,879
First week of the month
of the Yellow Ferret

145
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,620
to find the 12 greatest
fighters in the land

146
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:36,349
to become our elite Centurion Guard.

147
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,559
- Pretty cool name, right?
- Yeah.

148
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,941
Anyway, we offered fame,

149
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:43,359
glory, and instant wipe-clean
of your criminal record,

150
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,155
including... uh-huh... banishment marks.

151
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,323
And if they still hold the tournament,

152
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:50,230
it would be going on now, as we speak.

153
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:52,746
We should check on that, no?

154
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,500
It's Living Stone, I think.

155
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:02,249
Huh.

156
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,019
"Beware Takers."

157
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,591
"Beyond The Wall Adventure Tours,

158
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:06,760
500 feet that way."

159
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,379
Fill 'em.

160
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,300
Rocks, lots of dust.

161
00:07:12,301 --> 00:07:13,990
That'll be heavy.

162
00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:15,559
Burns Takers.

163
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,699
They come at night.

164
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,559
We'll make a circle to camp in.

165
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,740
Or, hey, travel light
if you want to die.

166
00:07:21,745 --> 00:07:25,403
So... Takers. What exactly are they?

167
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:27,405
You really don't know?

168
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:29,741
No.

169
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,519
Umber's tit.

170
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,037
Don't tell me you're grievers.

171
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,739
What's wrong with that?

172
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,739
You're not prepared for the mountain.

173
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,779
You can't run fast because
you've been sitting around

174
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,019
eating cake and crying.

175
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,769
Okay, I can grieve and
handle a little cardio,

176
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:45,840
thank you very much.

177
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:47,968
Yeah, we're Magicians. We'll be fine.

178
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:49,970
Don't say I didn't warn you.

179
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,819
You're planning to throw
something in at the top,

180
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,179
keep it safe.

181
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,019
Takers don't just take people.

182
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,687
They know what thing
you value and swipe it.

183
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,460
Alice.

184
00:08:07,312 --> 00:08:09,109
This zips.

185
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,324
It's the safest thing we've got.

186
00:08:12,274 --> 00:08:14,202
Alice, please let me take it.

187
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:15,760
Okay.

188
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,359
Well, this stopped being fun.

189
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,779
Yeah, well, you wanted to come.

190
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,999
Sure did. And it's awful.

191
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,019
Yeah, well, it's meant to be.

192
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,119
But maybe you don't feel that way

193
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,060
because it's not your pilgrimage.

194
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,999
What's that supposed to mean?

195
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,680
Nothing. Can we please not bicker?

196
00:09:16,686 --> 00:09:19,710
Sure. Let's not bicker.

197
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,770
What did you mean by not my pilgrimage?

198
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,719
I mean I'm here putting
my boyfriend to rest,

199
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,519
and you tagged along.

200
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,639
Right.

201
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,979
Because I barely knew him.

202
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,279
You know what I mean.

203
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,359
You're here out of some sort
of combination of thinking

204
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,952
I'm incompetent and your guilt

205
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,785
- that he died saving you.
- You know what?

206
00:09:40,786 --> 00:09:43,259
You are way too smart for me to ascribe

207
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,409
what just you said to total stupidity,

208
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,939
so I'm gonna go ahead
and I'm gonna file it

209
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,214
under you must be fucking
joking right now.

210
00:09:49,215 --> 00:09:50,959
No, I'm not!

211
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,179
This is hard enough
without you judging me

212
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,479
every step of the way.

213
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,999
Is that how you don't bicker?

214
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,179
'Cause that would explain a lot

215
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,932
about how you and Q kept falling apart,

216
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,643
beyond the obvious, of course.

217
00:10:01,644 --> 00:10:03,319
- The obvious?
- Yeah.

218
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,359
What, like drunk threesomes
with you and Margo?

219
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,779
Oh, hmm, solid point,
but I was thinking more

220
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,130
that one time where you
betrayed all of us,

221
00:10:10,131 --> 00:10:12,039
I ended up possessed, and Q died

222
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,460
cleaning up the mess.

223
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,786
And time for Yan to roll a smoke.

224
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,330
That was a little harsh.

225
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,499
And correct.

226
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,930
But not right because
you also saved my life.

227
00:10:29,933 --> 00:10:31,889
Right.

228
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:33,780
Trying to fix the mess I made.

229
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:38,054
Here we are again.

230
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,310
So let's just finish this, okay?

231
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:51,192
Yan, let's go.

232
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:52,693
Finished with your feelings?

233
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:55,519
Yes.

234
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,610
Uh...

235
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,780
Alice, no. Don't go that way.

236
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:13,715
Good luck, and enjoy the tournament.

237
00:11:13,716 --> 00:11:15,059
Hello.

238
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,844
I am Bick of the
esteemed House Pickwick.

239
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:20,079
- Who is entering?
- Me.

240
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,639
Your name?

241
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,999
- Janet.
- Janet.

242
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,389
Pluchinsky.

243
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,851
Weapon of choice?

244
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:28,396
Me. But also, I like axes.

245
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,941
Ah.

246
00:11:31,516 --> 00:11:34,249
You are registered. Proceed...

247
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,861
I'm entering too.

248
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:38,779
I just want to.

249
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:42,439
My name's Fen... cicle.

250
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,369
Wahl... burger.

251
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,665
- Weapon of choice?
- Knives.

252
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,580
I choose to use my Childsplay knives,

253
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:54,089
the kind of knives they give
to very young children.

254
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,710
Wow.

255
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,710
You had some kind of childhood.

256
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,930
Hmm.

257
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:07,099
Okay, so I found you this.

258
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,119
Fuck my life.

259
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,469
Or I can get you something else.

260
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,479
I just tried to do Singh's

261
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,815
Advanced Skin Hardening
twice, and touch me.

262
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:14,649
Smooth and perfect,

263
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,460
and I'm getting eaten alive

264
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,988
by whimsical goddamn Fillorian bugs.

265
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:20,039
Huh.

266
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,620
Um, you know what?

267
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:25,499
You just keep practicing
that shield casting,

268
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,039
and I'm, uh, gonna go check
on something real quick.

269
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,980
_

270
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,551
_

271
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:42,303
Do we even have an appointment?

272
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:44,054
What do you think?

273
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,310
What the hell just happened?

274
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:55,274
Where are we?

275
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,860
Um, excuse me. Is this PK Endeavors?

276
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,278
- I have an appointment.
- These two look confused.

277
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,280
Hi. Zoe Markus. I run the joint.

278
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,572
Julia Wicker. We e-mailed.

279
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,359
Hey, why does this place look exactly

280
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,640
like the Physical Kids' cottage?

281
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:07,910
You went to Brakebills?

282
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:10,581
I'm a professor at Brakebills.

283
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,583
Really?

284
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:15,570
Brakebills. Best years of my life.

285
00:13:15,577 --> 00:13:17,169
Hence...

286
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,879
I did a study.

287
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,530
Most Magicians cast 23% more accurately

288
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:22,761
when they've been drinking.

289
00:13:22,762 --> 00:13:24,800
God, we're fucked.

290
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,110
So what can I help you with?

291
00:13:28,111 --> 00:13:29,469
Stocks, you said?

292
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,560
I did say that.

293
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:33,169
Uh, we were hoping to talk
to your sister Daniella.

294
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,179
How come?

295
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,679
Well, um, to start,

296
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,191
you know how magic was regulated?

297
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:38,818
Until it wasn't, thank God.

298
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:41,859
Well, we stopped that, and a lot worse.

299
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,029
A friend of ours did,

300
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,690
but there were side effects.

301
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:48,328
Like the surges, which are...

302
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:49,569
Getting stronger.

303
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:53,499
We're concerned we're heading
towards a major event.

304
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,666
And you need...

305
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,794
Daniella to predict

306
00:13:55,795 --> 00:13:57,959
when it's going to happen.

307
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,922
We'll pay what we can.

308
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:04,094
Zoe, you and your sister would
be helping to save the world.

309
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,889
- I'd love to help...
- Great.

310
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,641
But unfortunately, I must decline.

311
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:12,434
Please, stay as long as you like.

312
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:14,150
Wait.

313
00:14:14,157 --> 00:14:15,313
Shit.

314
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,339
- Shit.
- It's okay.

315
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,680
We'll figure something out. Come on.

316
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:32,659
Okay, so I got some kinda bad news.

317
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,690
Fillory has two moons,
and if either is full,

318
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:36,208
then wolf time.

319
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,542
So one of them's full soon?

320
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,039
Both are tomorrow night,

321
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,047
which is why your wolf PMS
is acting so bad right now.

322
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,799
I'm about to be a double werewolf?

323
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,199
It's okay because there are still cages.

324
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,221
I checked, so it's totally fine.

325
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:50,539
- It's not fine.
- You're doing great.

326
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,559
No, the skin-hardening spell
I keep trying to cast

327
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,899
so I don't get flayed alive

328
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,979
only stuck to the left half of my body,

329
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,020
and also...

330
00:14:59,028 --> 00:15:01,029
I want to murder everything.

331
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,899
Oh, uh, more than usual?

332
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,119
Yes, in fact.

333
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,119
Well, maybe just some deep breaths,

334
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,770
- and you know, you got this, so...
- Fuck breathing.

335
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:10,990
I'm too annoyed to breathe.

336
00:15:10,997 --> 00:15:13,209
Mm.

337
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,119
But I like you anyway.

338
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,599
Thanks for the cheerleading, wolf boy.

339
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,740
Uh, of course.

340
00:15:21,746 --> 00:15:23,590
That's fine.

341
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,840
The air's so thin up here,
I think I'm hallucinating.

342
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,840
We're gonna need to rest
before we go again.

343
00:15:34,846 --> 00:15:37,353
I just wanna pin the circle in place.

344
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:45,820
Eliot.

345
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,039
Hey, Eliot.

346
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,630
Okay, just...

347
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,850
Okay.

348
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:14,589
Eliot, Taker! Back up!

349
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,140
Q's vial, you set it down.

350
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,686
Fuck! Just stay in the circle.

351
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,188
Eliot, no!

352
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,819
Fuck.

353
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,959
You all right?

354
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,709
Uh...

355
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:30,675
I'm really glad I took the north trail.

356
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:32,885
Pretty sure I'm gladder.

357
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,179
Who needs a drink?

358
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:43,225
Sorry, are you still...

359
00:17:43,226 --> 00:17:44,938
Oh, yeah, no. We're
just about done here.

360
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,356
Hold on.

361
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:47,649
Any luck?

362
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:49,693
Yeah, Zoe definitely
went here in the '90s,

363
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,984
but her professors don't
seem to remember her.

364
00:17:51,985 --> 00:17:54,899
She did a lot of field
work in Poland, I guess.

365
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,069
Zoe Markus?

366
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,489
Yeah, do you know her?

367
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,109
Well, she was my lab partner.

368
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:04,470
Oh, my God, we dropped
so much acid together.

369
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,139
We went to visit her work.

370
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,879
She's a big financial advisor.

371
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,089
Seriously?

372
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,439
Wow.

373
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,079
I mean, she was really
not into money at all

374
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,511
when I knew her and her sisters.

375
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:17,799
Sisters? More than one?

376
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,969
Yeah. Beth, Zoe, and Dani
who... no offense...

377
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:23,540
is a little weird.

378
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,564
Rumor has it that they averted
apocalypse in senior year.

379
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:43,539
They're good.

380
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:49,545
Janet of House Pluchinsky,

381
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:53,758
versus Faun of House Kaiko Swordmasters.

382
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,920
Whoo!

383
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:08,429
Fencicle of House Wahlburger.

384
00:19:19,593 --> 00:19:20,617
What?

385
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,831
Whoa!

386
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:56,153
God.

387
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,179
Goddamn!

388
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,499
We've been wasting her, right?

389
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,833
This is, like, spy movie perfect.

390
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,139
You're both in the dirty dozen,

391
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,295
and I'm the guy on the outside.

392
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:16,090
Victors, please approach the dais.

393
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,720
Congratulations.

394
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,179
Fencicle, what is your persuasion?

395
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,920
I mostly date humans.

396
00:20:27,922 --> 00:20:29,187
Are you a female?

397
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:32,310
And you, Janet?

398
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:33,398
Duh.

399
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:37,068
There can, of course, only
be one female Centurion.

400
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,321
And act three twist.

401
00:20:39,322 --> 00:20:41,198
For all the obvious reasons.

402
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:43,158
Um, not obvious to me.

403
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:45,950
I know, dear. That's one of the reasons.

404
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,179
You spar by the light

405
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,541
of the glorious double
full moon tomorrow night.

406
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:53,420
- Tomorrow night?
- That's no good.

407
00:20:53,426 --> 00:20:55,796
- I've got plans.
- Me too. I mean...

408
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:59,380
Oh, gravest apologies,
but the schedule...

409
00:20:59,388 --> 00:21:00,690
Chucklebuddy,

410
00:21:00,694 --> 00:21:03,339
I have a sexually transmitted curse.

411
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,560
Sun goes down tomorrow, I go wolf.

412
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,057
- This guy goes wolf.
- Hi.

413
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,429
Ember's balls.

414
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,648
And her, too, for some reason.

415
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:17,749
That what you want here?

416
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,340
Sure to be entertaining.

417
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,907
Probably be everyone
in here's last show.

418
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,413
- Reschedule the mimes.
- Yes, sir.

419
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:31,079
Your match will occur

420
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,290
in the hour before sundown tomorrow.

421
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:43,219
Margo, Josh and I only...
six or seven or...

422
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,160
it was less than a dozen
times, give or take,

423
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:48,098
and we would have never, ever done it

424
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:49,851
- if we had known...
- Excuse me.

425
00:21:50,787 --> 00:21:53,049
I need to sharpen my axe.

426
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:59,067
Well, please say something
nice at my funeral.

427
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,109
So, Loria.

428
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:09,619
I was making ends meet
selling rare objects.

429
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,331
Of course, when I got
there, I mostly drank.

430
00:22:12,332 --> 00:22:14,799
I think this story's
making me sound much less

431
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,840
mentally well-composed
than I actually am.

432
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:19,213
We are literally camping
on the Saddlehorn.

433
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:24,549
Anyway, I was at the border
when I saw my first Taker.

434
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,339
That thing you did...

435
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:30,015
I tried to throw something
at one earlier, and nothing.

436
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,009
Well, most things don't work.

437
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:33,894
Well, the Dark King can fend them off.

438
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:37,439
There are a few of us out
here who figured out ways.

439
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,760
How?

440
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:41,439
When it touched me,
it... it felt like a virus,

441
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,999
a plague.

442
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,031
I shot something off on
instinct, an anti-viral.

443
00:22:46,032 --> 00:22:48,241
You're a Magician from Earth?

444
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:50,827
My family is.

445
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:52,913
Well, do you think you can
show us what you did?

446
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:55,540
I... I will teach you whatever I can.

447
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:58,877
And something else I can share...

448
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:01,672
Lucky that the Taker didn't snatch it.

449
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,469
Thank you.

450
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,299
Is that Lorian Bumble Wine?

451
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,636
Uh-huh.

452
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:10,600
Cures altitude sickness,
opens the lungs,

453
00:23:10,606 --> 00:23:12,391
and gets you smashed.

454
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,268
Wait, I was gonna...

455
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:17,103
I was gonna say,
you should go easy on that.

456
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,979
Oh, my God.

457
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,239
It's too late now. I'm sorry.

458
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,901
- Well, cheers to that.
- Mm.

459
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,999
Mm.

460
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,449
- You're a danger tourist?
- No.

461
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,327
Mourning someone.

462
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:33,859
Who was it?

463
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,659
I mean, if you want to say.

464
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,520
Well...

465
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,579
The love of my life.

466
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,400
Died ridiculously young,
but he was a Magician,

467
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:45,216
and there's nothing more
dangerous than that.

468
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:48,239
My dreams were so filled with him,

469
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,971
I was convinced he was haunting me.

470
00:23:49,972 --> 00:23:54,760
So I took his diary up to
the top of the mountain

471
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,769
and threw it in.

472
00:23:58,654 --> 00:24:02,065
I felt a little better, so who knows?

473
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:05,359
- But you're here again.
- I come every year.

474
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,399
To honor him.

475
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,179
My boyfriend died.

476
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,569
Well, my on and off again...

477
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:13,799
it was... it's complicated.

478
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,079
I don't like talking about it.

479
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,080
I understand.

480
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,045
You knew him too?

481
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:27,500
Um... good friend.

482
00:24:29,642 --> 00:24:31,511
It's nice that you can do this together.

483
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:34,009
Yes, cheers to that too.

484
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,650
Well, I think I should start thinking

485
00:24:39,652 --> 00:24:43,040
about going to lie down so...
my eggs are scrambled.

486
00:24:43,046 --> 00:24:44,357
They sure are.

487
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,980
Hi, Daniella?

488
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,710
Awkward.

489
00:24:56,712 --> 00:24:58,580
Um, we didn't mean to scare you.

490
00:24:58,584 --> 00:25:00,206
We just wanted to talk to you
and your sister about...

491
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,875
What the hell are you doing?

492
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:03,460
I told you we can't help you.

493
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:05,590
- You can, but you won't.
- Hey, look.

494
00:25:05,591 --> 00:25:07,963
We're not asking you to join the fight.

495
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:10,399
- We just need your help in the...
- It's not just.

496
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,969
You think she'll stop if
she knows the stakes?

497
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,299
- Tell me about the problem.
- Don't!

498
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,389
Unless you wanna explain

499
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,499
how obsessed you get,

500
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,559
how you nearly got yourself killed,

501
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,560
how Beth did get killed.

502
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,019
- Look, we're sorry.
- I'm not.

503
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,650
Look, I get that you've lost a lot,

504
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,520
but so have we.

505
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,570
We need your help. I'm just saying...

506
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:33,364
We already saved the world, okay?

507
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:35,992
We get to be done.

508
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,786
Now get out.

509
00:25:37,787 --> 00:25:39,455
Don't come back.

510
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:46,759
There is nothing like
two grieving lunatics

511
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,709
drinking themselves to death
on a mountain of ghosts.

512
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,399
Cheers.

513
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,799
Mm.

514
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,960
Oh, it's a good sky tonight.

515
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,310
Please.

516
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:14,479
I used to do this with him.

517
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,199
We'd go somewhere, camp out,

518
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:23,980
and use illusion magic to
change the color of the stars.

519
00:26:26,323 --> 00:26:28,120
Sounds perfect.

520
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,721
Have you ever had love?

521
00:26:42,252 --> 00:26:44,349
Love? Uh, like...

522
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,679
Love.

523
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,179
It's okay. You can say anything.

524
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,079
I'm a stranger and you're drunk.

525
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,492
The friend we're putting to rest.

526
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,000
Wasn't just a friend.

527
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,710
- Does she know?
- Oh, God, no.

528
00:27:06,712 --> 00:27:09,499
A torrid secret affair.

529
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,547
Nothing like that.

530
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,339
Hmm.

531
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,925
It seems a bit selfish, then.

532
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,590
I'm just saying that seems
rather important information

533
00:27:19,594 --> 00:27:21,889
that he can't give her.

534
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,009
I mean, why punish her like that?

535
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,260
Why spare her?

536
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:28,019
You don't seem close.

537
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:32,020
Because she really, really loved him.

538
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:33,689
So did you.

539
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:34,879
Yeah.

540
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,879
So I don't her want to think...

541
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,279
Have you ever noticed that
people generally think

542
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,739
what the hell they want?

543
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,239
I'm starting to think

544
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,920
that you're a little
bit of a shit-stirrer.

545
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:51,059
I just fundamentally
believe that the best way

546
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,379
to honor someone is
with the truth of them.

547
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,619
You could give her more of that truth,

548
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:56,890
but you won't.

549
00:27:56,892 --> 00:27:58,499
I just want everybody
to remember Quentin

550
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,940
however they want to and to...

551
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,889
to get through the fucking day.

552
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,719
I'm just pointing out,

553
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,639
what you've got in that secret pocket

554
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,600
could help her remember
the real Quentin.

555
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,779
Death is so simple,

556
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,743
and life is so complicated.

557
00:28:24,267 --> 00:28:25,789
I know.

558
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:34,579
Well...

559
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,465
I should go to bed.

560
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,009
Before things get any more complicated.

561
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,159
Years ago,

562
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:57,379
the Dark King, in a show
of progressiveness,

563
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,560
allowed that there might be a female

564
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:03,649
among his Centurions
if one proved worthy.

565
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:08,119
This year we have two competitors

566
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,164
of the weaker sex.

567
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,949
I know, I know.

568
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,660
Or you could walk away.

569
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:15,545
Can't. This is for Fillory.

570
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:17,929
You're a little wolf crazy
right now, and mad.

571
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,299
You might actually kill her.

572
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,149
I know how to properly
lightly maim someone.

573
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,552
Thanks for your concern.

574
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:26,930
Janet Fencicle, let the battle commence!

575
00:29:33,989 --> 00:29:35,440
You smell anxious.

576
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:38,809
And you smell angry, so
please let me stab you.

577
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,405
- You are out of your mind.
- Margo, please.

578
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,866
Actually worked.

579
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:46,367
That's no fair, 'cause you can do magic.

580
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,359
You can do that twirly knife shit.

581
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,489
You have an axe.

582
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:52,050
Fine. No magic.

583
00:30:04,498 --> 00:30:06,804
Magic.

584
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,389
Oops.

585
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:28,359
We have a victor... a victorette.

586
00:30:31,177 --> 00:30:34,409
Your new lady Centurion.

587
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,050
I'm so sorry, Fen.

588
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,640
That was so well played!

589
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:53,219
How you knew to grab my knife.

590
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,228
Did I know that?

591
00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:56,599
Of course you did. Childsplay knife.

592
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,939
Perfectly safe.
We make them for children

593
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,775
so they can practice.

594
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:04,862
Sir, can you please bring
us to the werewolf cages?

595
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,490
Quickly? Thanks.

596
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,940
I think I'll take the east view.

597
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:25,200
I'll find you later if you
want to hike down together.

598
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,360
I'll just give you a moment.

599
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:50,868
No, stay.

600
00:31:54,216 --> 00:31:55,914
You cared about him too.

601
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,091
Do you think it goes all the
way down to the Underworld?

602
00:32:06,092 --> 00:32:09,845
I hope so, for Q.

603
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,430
Is there anything you
want to say to him?

604
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:33,410
Rest.

605
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:41,460
Okay, I think we can go now.

606
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,480
Wait, there's one more thing.

607
00:32:45,485 --> 00:32:47,399
Uh...

608
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,409
Wait, this stamp is enchanted.

609
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,849
_

610
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:05,959
- You could send this to him.
- Mm-hmm.

611
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,589
Before... oh, my God, Eliot.

612
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,510
You didn't send it 'cause you
were worried it could be...

613
00:33:12,512 --> 00:33:14,033
So much worse if I changed it.

614
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,479
- Alice...
- Huh?

615
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,918
Is there a way that we
could really, truly know?

616
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,999
Eliot, I really don't know.

617
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:33,699
S... sometimes I just wish
if you all just went faster,

618
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,879
if you just...

619
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,099
Just locked the fucking door.

620
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,429
No, because Everett would still...

621
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:42,379
Right, Everett. Of course.

622
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:46,179
Q...

623
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,901
If Q hadn't stopped Everett, then...

624
00:33:47,902 --> 00:33:50,111
So many more people could die.

625
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:53,489
But I just keep thinking if...
if I can just crack the code

626
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:54,659
then... then we can fix it.

627
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,979
I don't think there's a perfect code

628
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,327
for changing the past.

629
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,079
I can't send it,

630
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,579
but I... I can't just let go.

631
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,819
It's okay.

632
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,979
He was your friend.

633
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,450
He wasn't just my friend.

634
00:34:19,016 --> 00:34:20,640
I'm sorry.

635
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,299
He loved you.

636
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,065
I... why would I want to
take that away from you now?

637
00:34:27,066 --> 00:34:29,780
That would be so cruel.

638
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:32,321
You really think I didn't
know there was more?

639
00:34:38,598 --> 00:34:41,759
I knew Q really well.

640
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,250
And if anyone was messy, it was him.

641
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,020
Yeah.

642
00:34:49,338 --> 00:34:51,923
He was pretty in love with you.

643
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,879
I'm not sure that I'd say that.

644
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,880
I would.

645
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:02,840
What was I supposed to do, huh?

646
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,187
Demand that he only love me?

647
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,604
Scream at him to be a
less complicated person?

648
00:35:09,605 --> 00:35:12,194
I mean, it's Quentin
we're talking about.

649
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,070
And I loved him.

650
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:22,440
The real him, all of him.

651
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,340
Well, um, there's something

652
00:35:28,343 --> 00:35:29,752
he probably didn't tell you about.

653
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:32,589
The mosaic.

654
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:37,670
Um, there was this timeline.

655
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,480
We somehow remembered pieces of it,

656
00:35:43,489 --> 00:35:45,685
but these, uh... these beautiful pieces,

657
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:47,849
and it was...

658
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:51,479
We loved each other for
a really, really long time,

659
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,439
and, um, so,

660
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,399
you know, uh, I promptly
told him to fuck off,

661
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,590
and... and, you know,
he... he... he died for me.

662
00:36:08,731 --> 00:36:09,829
Eliot.

663
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:16,129
Eliot, I have done...

664
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,519
A lot of bad things, and I
have hurt people, okay?

665
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,529
And the one thing that I
hold onto is that I know,

666
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:28,349
deep down, that I was doing my best.

667
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:31,790
Were you doing the best that you could?

668
00:36:31,798 --> 00:36:34,270
Unfortunately at the time...

669
00:36:35,889 --> 00:36:37,359
Yes.

670
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,979
I never even got to talk to him again.

671
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:44,410
He just died.

672
00:36:44,419 --> 00:36:46,949
I'm sorry.

673
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:50,099
Yeah, file it under
things I wish I could say

674
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,859
in this fucking letter that
I can't actually send.

675
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:57,381
But I can't let go of it, either.

676
00:36:58,912 --> 00:37:01,218
You want my help?

677
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,308
Yeah.

678
00:37:08,835 --> 00:37:10,719
But we can do it together, okay?

679
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,520
Okay.

680
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:15,399
On the count of three.

681
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,069
Okay.

682
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,930
- One.
- One.

683
00:37:21,935 --> 00:37:24,320
- Two.
- Two.

684
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:25,740
Three.

685
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,819
That was brave.

686
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,008
He was brave.

687
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:42,389
You were brave.

688
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:54,749
Eliot?

689
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:56,060
Yeah?

690
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,940
Thank you for telling me.

691
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:12,220
Guards, hello! We're human again!

692
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,619
Margo.

693
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,629
Can I say one thing?

694
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,679
I'm sorry I slept with Josh.

695
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:26,049
- We were just lonely.
- Fen, stop apologizing.

696
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:31,476
I don't own Josh's penis,
and I don't want to.

697
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,769
But you seem...

698
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,729
Can I have a complicated emotion

699
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:39,150
without having to resolve
it so you can feel better?

700
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:44,679
I am grateful that even in
your complicated state,

701
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,408
you still reached for
the Childsplay knife.

702
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:49,785
- You're a good person...
- I thought it was a real knife.

703
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:56,810
Glad it wasn't today,
but I'm not a good person.

704
00:38:56,812 --> 00:38:59,420
Okay, well,

705
00:38:59,424 --> 00:39:01,539
matters of the heart can be irrational

706
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,959
and sometimes even the best of us...

707
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,089
Stop trying to forgive me.

708
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:06,970
We want you to forgive us.

709
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:10,339
We promised ourselves we
wouldn't give up on you,

710
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,969
but we did.

711
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:13,640
You never gave up on us.

712
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,810
Yeah, you figured out a way.

713
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:18,564
Eliot sent the letter.

714
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:20,733
I was gonna let you die
for Fillory, but...

715
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,739
Kings.

716
00:39:26,451 --> 00:39:28,879
We have a job,

717
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,840
and we put it first, right?

718
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,149
So...

719
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:38,940
you didn't save us,

720
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:40,461
and then you stabbed me.

721
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,519
Am I a fool?

722
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,709
No... no, really.

723
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,676
- Am I?
- No more than me.

724
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:49,094
You're a lovesick idiot!

725
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:52,589
- Hey!
- I went into battle for you

726
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:55,719
thinking that you gave a
single flea on a donkey's ass

727
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,479
for any of us,

728
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,040
thinking that we owed you something.

729
00:40:02,356 --> 00:40:03,440
Stupid me.

730
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:23,289
I've been thinking about what Zoe said.

731
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:25,172
It's a valid question.

732
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:27,217
When do you save the world enough?

733
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:31,510
Look, I'm... I'm with you on anything,

734
00:40:31,516 --> 00:40:33,347
but I gotta be honest.

735
00:40:33,348 --> 00:40:34,932
If we survive this one,

736
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:37,768
I want a life, Julia.

737
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:39,469
Ideally, with you.

738
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:40,896
Yeah, I want that too.

739
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,607
I'm not sure you do,
and tha... and that's okay.

740
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:45,090
Right now we got shit to do,

741
00:40:45,094 --> 00:40:47,440
but if we don't die,

742
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,779
we gotta figure this out.

743
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,100
Hello.

744
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,859
I solved your problem.

745
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:57,869
You were right. Surges are increasing.

746
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:58,879
They're unpredictable...

747
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,874
hidden variables that defy calculation.

748
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,669
But if we can't predict it...

749
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,339
Correct. You can't.

750
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:07,179
So instead, I created
a statistical model

751
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:10,010
to predict a window within
which a surge might occur.

752
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,599
Wow.

753
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,379
Okay, this is a start.

754
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,639
Are you familiar with the
Harmonic Convergence?

755
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,340
No.

756
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:21,470
A rare and powerful
astrological occurrence.

757
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,896
A magnifier of magic.

758
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,219
There have been four.

759
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,859
Extinction of the dinosaurs,

760
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,079
Pompeii,

761
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:31,363
sinking of Atlantis, and the
invention of Auto-Tune.

762
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:33,115
In two weeks, there will be a fifth.

763
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:34,283
How bad will it be?

764
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:37,189
This is the event you're worried about.

765
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,620
Circumstances on the Convergence

766
00:41:38,626 --> 00:41:40,289
will be exceptionally favorable,

767
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:43,149
which in this case is not a good thing,

768
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:45,959
because it falls in a surge window.

769
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,500
Castings will be
exponentially magnified.

770
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,923
Enchantments will malfunction.

771
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,216
Death toll in the millions.

772
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:53,093
- Maybe much higher.
- How can we stop it?

773
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:56,129
You can't, unless you stop the surges,

774
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,639
change astrology,

775
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,932
or tell everyone on
Earth not to do magic.

776
00:41:59,933 --> 00:42:01,019
Whatever you try,

777
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,340
if you need help, I will help you.

778
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:04,855
And so will my sister.

779
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:06,940
I'm pretty sure she doesn't want to.

780
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:10,527
She doesn't, but if the moment comes,

781
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,310
you can count on the both of us.

782
00:42:12,312 --> 00:42:14,323
Wait. Dani.

783
00:42:14,324 --> 00:42:16,409
Thank you so much for your help.

784
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:18,499
My pleasure.

785
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,980
My sister will invoice you for my time.

786
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,790
Well, we go that-a-way.

787
00:42:28,797 --> 00:42:32,216
A tree near Whitespire can take us home.

788
00:42:32,217 --> 00:42:36,096
I'm headed in that direction,
if you'd like some company.

789
00:42:36,989 --> 00:42:38,764
- Um, yeah.
- We wouldn't mind.

790
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,870
Make way!

791
00:42:44,813 --> 00:42:46,856
Is that the Dark King's carriage?

792
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:52,569
Are we in trouble again?

793
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,089
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

794
00:43:11,327 --> 00:43:13,675
Would you like a ride to Whitespire?

795
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,800
- Uh...
- I think we'll walk.

796
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:18,512
Um...

797
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:21,933
I hope your journey gave you
everything that you needed.

798
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,351
Please call on me

799
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:26,689
if there's ever anything
I can do for you.

800
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:36,281
He's...

801
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,500
I think I almost fucked the Dark King.
