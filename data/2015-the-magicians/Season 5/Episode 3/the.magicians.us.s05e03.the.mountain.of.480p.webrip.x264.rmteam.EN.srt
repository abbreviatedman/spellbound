1
00:00:06,484 --> 00:00:09,139
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:10,271 --> 00:00:11,671
I will save the people
of Fillory.

3
00:00:13,187 --> 00:00:14,492
The people would decide

4
00:00:14,536 --> 00:00:16,451
to make this dark wizard
their king,

5
00:00:16,494 --> 00:00:18,496
the Dark King.

6
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,498
So you built a golem
out of living clay,

7
00:00:20,542 --> 00:00:21,867
and then you animated
the whole thing

8
00:00:21,891 --> 00:00:23,675
with his essence?

9
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:26,330
No, it's just a tiny grain
of Q's soul

10
00:00:26,374 --> 00:00:28,115
that I pulled
from the Underworld.

11
00:00:28,158 --> 00:00:30,508
Put back the piece of Q's
essence that you stole

12
00:00:30,552 --> 00:00:31,857
and let him be at rest.

13
00:00:31,901 --> 00:00:33,511
Good-bye, Quentin.

14
00:00:33,555 --> 00:00:35,122
Some surges come and go

15
00:00:35,165 --> 00:00:36,732
and hardly anyone notices.

16
00:00:36,775 --> 00:00:39,822
And sometimes
it's a catastrophe.

17
00:00:39,865 --> 00:00:41,389
Is there any way
to predict them?

18
00:00:41,432 --> 00:00:42,888
Look, I need help
with a metamath problem.

19
00:00:42,912 --> 00:00:44,392
My dad had a friend

20
00:00:44,435 --> 00:00:47,569
with a really rare discipline,

21
00:00:47,612 --> 00:00:49,223
predicting circumstances.

22
00:00:49,266 --> 00:00:50,485
She wrote this.

23
00:00:50,528 --> 00:00:52,226
- Wait.
- I recognize these.

24
00:00:52,269 --> 00:00:54,184
Put 'em on a letter,

25
00:00:54,228 --> 00:00:55,881
address it to whoever, wherever,

26
00:00:55,925 --> 00:00:57,666
whenever, and it gets to them.

27
00:01:00,582 --> 00:01:02,584
Because I want you to be safe.

28
00:01:02,627 --> 00:01:04,673
I want you to be safe.

29
00:01:04,716 --> 00:01:07,110
- Are you saying that you...
- No, I'm just...

30
00:01:07,154 --> 00:01:09,547
we've tried the whole
"saving each other" thing

31
00:01:09,591 --> 00:01:11,680
with mixed results.

32
00:01:11,723 --> 00:01:13,551
Yeah.

33
00:01:13,595 --> 00:01:15,205
Sure, but I...

34
00:01:15,249 --> 00:01:18,165
And I've been thinking
about what works best,

35
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:20,167
and I think... no, I know...

36
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,822
that we're best when we're
a team and we work together,

37
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:24,867
you and me.

38
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:28,509
If nothing else,
I like the sound of it.

39
00:01:33,702 --> 00:01:35,486
Quentin?

40
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,792
Quentin!

41
00:02:04,646 --> 00:02:05,821
Oh, shit.

42
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,832
- Whoo, yeah!
- There she is!

43
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:18,747
- Champagne for our girl!
- Whoo!

44
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,619
High King Margo,
a thousand huzzahs!

45
00:02:21,663 --> 00:02:24,274
- Go, Bambi.
- Um, why?

46
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:25,623
We wanted to honor you,

47
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:27,451
so when Julia sent us the bunny

48
00:02:27,495 --> 00:02:30,411
saying that they put
the clock in here,

49
00:02:30,454 --> 00:02:32,432
we asked them to stock up
on celebratory beverages.

50
00:02:32,456 --> 00:02:33,825
- Stay on mission.
- We're going back.

51
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:35,285
- Copy.
- Give me 30.

52
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:36,567
We'll have cookies
to help brainstorm

53
00:02:36,591 --> 00:02:38,245
how you're gonna overthrow
the Dark King.

54
00:02:42,553 --> 00:02:44,381
Well, your subjects
are rightly grateful.

55
00:02:44,425 --> 00:02:46,296
For sending that letter?

56
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,863
A.K.A. that thing
I totally didn't do.

57
00:02:47,906 --> 00:02:49,386
You did.

58
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,692
Why split a hair?

59
00:02:50,735 --> 00:02:52,433
Let them bake cookies.

60
00:02:52,476 --> 00:02:54,348
- Lie cookies?
- It's not a lie.

61
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:56,524
You saved them through me,
your advisor,

62
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:57,612
acting on your behalf.

63
00:02:57,655 --> 00:02:59,004
Nice retcon.

64
00:02:59,048 --> 00:03:01,746
Then as a wise king once said,

65
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,357
ovary up.

66
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,880
Let your subjects be inspired

67
00:03:04,923 --> 00:03:07,404
by a simple,
uncomplicated story.

68
00:03:07,448 --> 00:03:08,884
That's what the people want.

69
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:18,241
Would you excuse me?

70
00:03:21,549 --> 00:03:22,874
Where are you going,
and why are you dressed

71
00:03:22,898 --> 00:03:24,029
like a goth survivalist?

72
00:03:24,073 --> 00:03:25,901
Fillory, just quick.

73
00:03:25,944 --> 00:03:27,946
- What you got there?
- Nothing.

74
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,602
I did a thing.
This is a by-product.

75
00:03:31,646 --> 00:03:32,884
I just have to take care of it.

76
00:03:32,908 --> 00:03:35,563
Alice, do you need help?

77
00:03:35,606 --> 00:03:37,042
You seem a little bit
distressed.

78
00:03:37,086 --> 00:03:39,393
I'm fine.

79
00:03:39,436 --> 00:03:40,568
I just have to do it alone.

80
00:03:40,611 --> 00:03:43,397
- Okay, great.
- What was the spell?

81
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,268
I made a golem, okay?

82
00:03:45,312 --> 00:03:46,941
You've done it before.
It's not a big deal.

83
00:03:46,965 --> 00:03:48,793
A golem of who?

84
00:03:48,837 --> 00:03:51,666
Can we... can we not
be dramatic about this?

85
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:53,755
I used his book
from the Library.

86
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,020
- Quentin's?
- But I was out of my mind,

87
00:03:58,063 --> 00:04:01,066
and I didn't think that
this would just stay here

88
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,981
when I buried the golem
and not be released.

89
00:04:05,332 --> 00:04:06,550
It's Essence.

90
00:04:06,594 --> 00:04:07,856
It's a tiny piece of his soul.

91
00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:09,074
I'm sorry, you pulled

92
00:04:09,118 --> 00:04:10,554
an actual piece
of Quentin's soul

93
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:12,774
out of his... that is insane.

94
00:04:12,817 --> 00:04:13,968
What if it's...
Keeping him from resting?

95
00:04:13,992 --> 00:04:15,733
Well, is it?

96
00:04:15,777 --> 00:04:17,363
I just need to get
to the top of this mountain

97
00:04:17,387 --> 00:04:18,388
and throw it in.

98
00:04:18,432 --> 00:04:19,650
The Mountain of Ghosts

99
00:04:19,694 --> 00:04:21,054
that Rupert Chatwin
was looking for

100
00:04:21,086 --> 00:04:22,523
before the band of aggressive

101
00:04:22,566 --> 00:04:24,089
talking squirrels kidnapped him?

102
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:25,482
I'm finally reading the books.

103
00:04:25,526 --> 00:04:27,310
Margo has been
on my ass about it.

104
00:04:27,354 --> 00:04:29,007
Anyway, is that it?

105
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:30,724
The one with the hole
at the top that goes...

106
00:04:30,748 --> 00:04:32,576
All the way down
to the Underworld?

107
00:04:34,056 --> 00:04:36,319
- Yes.
- Well, this is too important.

108
00:04:36,363 --> 00:04:38,060
- I'm helping.
- I don't need your help.

109
00:04:38,103 --> 00:04:39,143
Well, you're getting it.

110
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,719
Fine.

111
00:05:06,523 --> 00:05:08,786
Head hurt from the patch?

112
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:12,137
Uh, it beats the noise.

113
00:05:12,181 --> 00:05:13,748
Burning through them, though,

114
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:15,837
so looking
for some real answers.

115
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:20,798
None of these books is for shit.

116
00:05:20,842 --> 00:05:23,584
Requested some from the Library
but not getting the sense

117
00:05:23,627 --> 00:05:25,325
they're gonna be that speedy.

118
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,547
So, while you're waiting...

119
00:05:31,896 --> 00:05:34,595
God, that...
always a great idea,

120
00:05:34,638 --> 00:05:36,814
but I really do have a headache.

121
00:05:36,858 --> 00:05:38,773
No, I need a ride.

122
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,820
Fine.

123
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:53,831
I've been thinking,
we should tell her.

124
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,747
Look, can we just concentrate
one thing at a time, please?

125
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:58,923
Let's just get her back
on the throne, huh?

126
00:05:58,967 --> 00:06:01,665
Yeah, well,
with those banishment brands,

127
00:06:01,709 --> 00:06:02,990
good luck getting her
in the kingdom,

128
00:06:03,014 --> 00:06:04,799
never mind the castle.

129
00:06:04,842 --> 00:06:06,409
Oh, shit.

130
00:06:06,453 --> 00:06:07,845
What month is it in Fillory?

131
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:09,630
Is it spring yet?

132
00:06:09,673 --> 00:06:11,849
Yellow Ferret Month, yes.

133
00:06:11,893 --> 00:06:13,523
Have you ever seen the movie
"The Dirty Dozen"?

134
00:06:13,547 --> 00:06:14,852
Not the porn one.

135
00:06:14,896 --> 00:06:16,680
No, and I have a life,
so summarize.

136
00:06:16,724 --> 00:06:18,029
Uh, not important.

137
00:06:18,073 --> 00:06:20,162
Point is, it inspired me
to do this thing

138
00:06:20,205 --> 00:06:23,078
when the Taker attacks
were just starting.

139
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:25,123
We needed better guards,

140
00:06:25,167 --> 00:06:28,083
so I created
an annual tournament.

141
00:06:28,126 --> 00:06:30,041
First week of the month
of the Yellow Ferret

142
00:06:30,085 --> 00:06:32,827
to find the 12 greatest
fighters in the land

143
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:36,526
to become our elite
Centurion Guard.

144
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,702
- Pretty cool name, right?
- Yeah.

145
00:06:38,746 --> 00:06:40,791
Anyway, we offered fame, glory,

146
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:43,533
and instant wipe-clean
of your criminal record,

147
00:06:43,577 --> 00:06:46,188
including... uh-huh...
banishment marks.

148
00:06:46,231 --> 00:06:47,513
And if they still hold
the tournament,

149
00:06:47,537 --> 00:06:50,192
it would be going on now,
as we speak.

150
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:52,673
We should check on that, no?

151
00:06:58,548 --> 00:07:01,116
It's Living Stone, I think.

152
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:02,160
Huh.

153
00:07:02,204 --> 00:07:04,119
"Beware Takers."

154
00:07:04,162 --> 00:07:05,642
"Beyond The Wall
Adventure Tours,

155
00:07:05,686 --> 00:07:06,687
500 feet that way."

156
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:10,473
Fill 'em.

157
00:07:10,517 --> 00:07:12,257
Rocks, lots of dust.

158
00:07:12,301 --> 00:07:13,955
That'll be heavy.

159
00:07:13,998 --> 00:07:15,522
Burns Takers.

160
00:07:15,565 --> 00:07:16,740
They come at night.

161
00:07:16,784 --> 00:07:18,699
We'll make a circle to camp in.

162
00:07:18,742 --> 00:07:21,702
Or, hey, travel light
if you want to die.

163
00:07:21,745 --> 00:07:25,227
- So... Takers.
- What exactly are they?

164
00:07:26,141 --> 00:07:27,229
You really don't know?

165
00:07:28,056 --> 00:07:29,100
No.

166
00:07:31,799 --> 00:07:33,757
Umber's tit.

167
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:35,063
Don't tell me you're grievers.

168
00:07:35,106 --> 00:07:36,847
What's wrong with that?

169
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:38,980
You're not prepared
for the mountain.

170
00:07:39,023 --> 00:07:40,653
You can't run fast because
you've been sitting around

171
00:07:40,677 --> 00:07:42,505
eating cake and crying.

172
00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:44,681
Okay, I can grieve
and handle a little cardio,

173
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:45,943
thank you very much.

174
00:07:45,987 --> 00:07:47,945
- Yeah, we're Magicians.
- We'll be fine.

175
00:07:47,989 --> 00:07:50,121
Don't say I didn't warn you.

176
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,796
You're planning to throw
something in at the top,

177
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,125
keep it safe.

178
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:56,127
Takers don't just take people.

179
00:07:56,171 --> 00:07:58,652
They know what thing you value
and swipe it.

180
00:08:04,092 --> 00:08:05,092
Alice.

181
00:08:07,312 --> 00:08:09,140
This zips.

182
00:08:09,184 --> 00:08:10,490
It's the safest thing we've got.

183
00:08:12,274 --> 00:08:14,102
Alice, please let me take it.

184
00:08:14,145 --> 00:08:15,233
Okay.

185
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:01,323
Well, this stopped being fun.

186
00:09:01,366 --> 00:09:02,890
Yeah, well, you wanted to come.

187
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:05,066
- Sure did.
- And it's awful.

188
00:09:05,109 --> 00:09:06,981
Yeah, well, it's meant to be.

189
00:09:07,024 --> 00:09:08,349
But maybe you don't feel
that way because

190
00:09:08,373 --> 00:09:09,810
it's not your pilgrimage.

191
00:09:11,942 --> 00:09:14,075
What's that supposed to mean?

192
00:09:14,118 --> 00:09:16,643
- Nothing.
- Can we please not bicker?

193
00:09:16,686 --> 00:09:19,863
- Sure.
- Let's not bicker.

194
00:09:19,907 --> 00:09:21,735
What did you mean by
not my pilgrimage?

195
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:26,870
I mean I'm here putting
my boyfriend to rest,

196
00:09:26,914 --> 00:09:28,350
and you tagged along.

197
00:09:29,307 --> 00:09:30,918
Right.

198
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:32,746
Because I barely knew him.

199
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:34,356
You know what I mean.

200
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,620
You're here out of some sort
of combination of thinking

201
00:09:37,664 --> 00:09:40,014
I'm incompetent and your guilt
that he died saving you.

202
00:09:40,057 --> 00:09:41,624
You know what?

203
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:43,278
You are way too smart
for me to ascribe

204
00:09:43,321 --> 00:09:45,193
what just you said
to total stupidity,

205
00:09:45,236 --> 00:09:47,064
so I'm gonna go ahead
and I'm gonna file it

206
00:09:47,108 --> 00:09:49,153
under you must be fucking
joking right now.

207
00:09:49,197 --> 00:09:51,634
No, I'm not!

208
00:09:51,678 --> 00:09:54,158
This is hard enough
without you judging me

209
00:09:54,202 --> 00:09:55,420
every step of the way.

210
00:09:55,464 --> 00:09:57,031
Is that how you don't bicker?

211
00:09:57,074 --> 00:09:58,269
'Cause that would explain a lot

212
00:09:58,293 --> 00:10:00,034
about how you and Q
kept falling apart,

213
00:10:00,077 --> 00:10:01,731
beyond the obvious, of course.

214
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:03,690
- The obvious?
- Yeah.

215
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:05,653
What, like drunk threesomes
with you and Margo?

216
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:07,911
Oh, hmm, solid point,
but I was thinking more

217
00:10:07,955 --> 00:10:10,087
that one time where
you betrayed all of us,

218
00:10:10,131 --> 00:10:12,002
I ended up possessed, and Q died

219
00:10:12,046 --> 00:10:13,047
cleaning up the mess.

220
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,749
And time for Yan
to roll a smoke.

221
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,274
That was a little harsh.

222
00:10:23,318 --> 00:10:25,712
And correct.

223
00:10:25,755 --> 00:10:29,890
But not right because
you also saved my life.

224
00:10:29,933 --> 00:10:31,848
Right.

225
00:10:31,892 --> 00:10:33,328
Trying to fix the mess I made.

226
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:37,985
Here we are again.

227
00:10:41,162 --> 00:10:43,164
So let's just finish this, okay?

228
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,215
Yan, let's go.

229
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:52,739
Finished with your feelings?

230
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,437
Yes.

231
00:10:57,874 --> 00:10:59,789
Uh...

232
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,835
Alice, no.
Don't go that way.

233
00:11:11,845 --> 00:11:13,585
Good luck,
and enjoy the tournament.

234
00:11:13,977 --> 00:11:15,283
Hello.

235
00:11:15,326 --> 00:11:17,764
I am Bick of the esteemed
House Pickwick.

236
00:11:17,807 --> 00:11:20,636
- Who is entering?
- Me.

237
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,377
- Your name?
- Janet.

238
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,509
- Janet.
- Pluchinsky.

239
00:11:24,553 --> 00:11:26,773
- Weapon of choice?
- Me.

240
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:28,775
But also, I like axes.

241
00:11:28,818 --> 00:11:30,167
Ah.

242
00:11:31,516 --> 00:11:34,258
You are registered.
Proceed...

243
00:11:34,302 --> 00:11:35,782
I'm entering too.

244
00:11:35,825 --> 00:11:38,698
I just want to.

245
00:11:39,742 --> 00:11:42,614
My name's Fen... cicle.

246
00:11:42,658 --> 00:11:44,834
Wahl... burger.

247
00:11:44,878 --> 00:11:46,575
- Weapon of choice?
- Knives.

248
00:11:48,011 --> 00:11:50,753
I choose to use
my Childsplay knives,

249
00:11:50,797 --> 00:11:53,887
the kind of knives they give
to very young children.

250
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:56,672
Wow.

251
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,675
You had some kind of childhood.

252
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,546
Hmm.

253
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,987
Okay, so I found you this.

254
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,292
Fuck my life.

255
00:12:08,336 --> 00:12:09,574
Or I can get you something else.

256
00:12:09,598 --> 00:12:10,662
I just tried to do Singh's

257
00:12:10,686 --> 00:12:11,794
Advanced Skin Hardening twice,

258
00:12:11,818 --> 00:12:12,993
and touch me.

259
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:14,690
Smooth and perfect,

260
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,605
and I'm getting eaten alive

261
00:12:16,648 --> 00:12:18,825
by whimsical goddamn
Fillorian bugs.

262
00:12:18,868 --> 00:12:20,000
Huh.

263
00:12:20,043 --> 00:12:22,742
Um, you know what?

264
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:25,614
You just keep practicing
that shield casting,

265
00:12:25,657 --> 00:12:28,965
and I'm, uh, gonna go
check on something real quick.

266
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:42,370
Do we even have an appointment?

267
00:12:42,413 --> 00:12:43,937
What do you think?

268
00:12:50,465 --> 00:12:53,381
What the hell just happened?

269
00:12:53,424 --> 00:12:55,426
Where are we?

270
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,951
- Um, excuse me.
- Is this PK Endeavors?

271
00:12:57,994 --> 00:12:59,406
- I have an appointment.
- These two look confused.

272
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,389
Hi. Zoe Markus.
I run the joint.

273
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:02,738
- Julia Wicker.
- We E-mailed.

274
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,392
Hey, why does
this place look exactly

275
00:13:04,435 --> 00:13:05,715
like the Physical Kids' cottage?

276
00:13:06,611 --> 00:13:07,874
You went to Brakebills?

277
00:13:07,917 --> 00:13:10,572
I'm a professor at Brakebills.

278
00:13:10,615 --> 00:13:12,704
Really?

279
00:13:12,748 --> 00:13:15,533
Breakbills.
Best years of my life.

280
00:13:15,577 --> 00:13:17,057
Hence...

281
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,710
I did a study.

282
00:13:18,754 --> 00:13:21,496
Most Magicians
cast 23% more accurately

283
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:23,019
when they've been drinking.

284
00:13:23,063 --> 00:13:26,414
God, we're fucked.

285
00:13:26,457 --> 00:13:28,068
So what can I help you with?

286
00:13:28,111 --> 00:13:29,504
Stocks, you said?

287
00:13:29,547 --> 00:13:30,940
I did say that.

288
00:13:30,984 --> 00:13:33,334
Uh, we were hoping to talk
to your sister Daniella.

289
00:13:33,377 --> 00:13:34,509
How come?

290
00:13:34,552 --> 00:13:35,858
Well, um, to start,

291
00:13:35,902 --> 00:13:37,338
you know how magic
was regulated?

292
00:13:37,381 --> 00:13:38,861
Until it wasn't, thank God.

293
00:13:38,905 --> 00:13:42,430
Well, we stopped that,
and a lot worse.

294
00:13:42,473 --> 00:13:44,606
A friend of ours did,

295
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:46,651
but there were side effects.

296
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:48,392
Like the surges, which are...

297
00:13:48,436 --> 00:13:50,481
Getting stronger.

298
00:13:50,525 --> 00:13:53,528
We're concerned we're heading
towards a major event.

299
00:13:53,571 --> 00:13:54,703
And you need...

300
00:13:54,746 --> 00:13:55,791
Daniella to predict

301
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:56,966
when it's going to happen.

302
00:13:58,533 --> 00:14:00,665
We'll pay what we can.

303
00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:03,930
Zoe, you and your sister would
be helping to save the world.

304
00:14:05,757 --> 00:14:07,847
- I'd love to help...
- Great.

305
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,719
But unfortunately,
I must decline.

306
00:14:10,762 --> 00:14:12,460
Please, stay as long
as you like.

307
00:14:12,503 --> 00:14:14,114
Wait.

308
00:14:14,157 --> 00:14:15,332
Shit.

309
00:14:16,725 --> 00:14:18,553
- Shit.
- It's okay.

310
00:14:18,596 --> 00:14:20,642
We'll figure something out.
Come on.

311
00:14:29,651 --> 00:14:32,741
Okay, so I got some
kinda bad news.

312
00:14:32,784 --> 00:14:34,656
Fillory has two moons,
and if either is full,

313
00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:36,136
then wolf time.

314
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:37,615
So one of them's full soon?

315
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:39,400
Both are tomorrow night,

316
00:14:39,443 --> 00:14:42,055
which is why your wolf PMS
is acting so bad right now.

317
00:14:42,098 --> 00:14:43,883
I'm about to be
a double werewolf?

318
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:46,407
It's okay because
there are still cages.

319
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,409
I checked, so it's totally fine.

320
00:14:48,452 --> 00:14:50,672
- It's not fine.
- You're doing great.

321
00:14:50,715 --> 00:14:53,718
No, the skin-hardening spell
I keep trying to cast

322
00:14:53,762 --> 00:14:56,417
so I don't get flayed alive
only stuck to the left half

323
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,985
of my body, and also...

324
00:14:59,028 --> 00:15:00,987
I want to murder everything.

325
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:03,859
Oh, uh, more than usual?

326
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,556
Yes, in fact.

327
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,994
Well, maybe just some
deep breaths, and you know,

328
00:15:08,037 --> 00:15:09,734
you got this, so...
Fuck breathing.

329
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:10,953
I'm too annoyed to breathe.

330
00:15:10,997 --> 00:15:13,173
Mm.

331
00:15:13,216 --> 00:15:16,872
But I like you anyway.

332
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,874
Thanks for the cheerleading,
wolf boy.

333
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,703
Uh, of course.

334
00:15:21,746 --> 00:15:23,574
That's fine.

335
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:27,752
The air's so thin up here,
I think I'm hallucinating.

336
00:15:32,844 --> 00:15:34,803
We're gonna need to rest
before we go again.

337
00:15:34,846 --> 00:15:37,153
I just wanna pin
the circle in place.

338
00:15:44,813 --> 00:15:45,813
Eliot.

339
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,519
Hey, Eliot.

340
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:00,481
Okay, just...

341
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:09,707
Okay.

342
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,669
- Eliot, Taker!
- Back up!

343
00:16:14,712 --> 00:16:17,106
Q's vial, you set it down.

344
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,717
- Fuck!
- Just stay in the circle.

345
00:16:19,761 --> 00:16:21,110
Eliot, no!

346
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:35,777
Fuck.

347
00:17:25,261 --> 00:17:28,134
- You all right?
- Uh...

348
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:31,224
I'm really glad
I took the north trail.

349
00:17:31,267 --> 00:17:32,834
Pretty sure I'm gladder.

350
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,054
Who needs a drink?

351
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,323
Sorry, are you still...

352
00:17:44,672 --> 00:17:44,715
- Oh, yeah, no.
- We're just about done here.

353
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:46,282
Hold on.

354
00:17:46,326 --> 00:17:47,718
Any luck?

355
00:17:47,762 --> 00:17:49,764
Yeah, Zoe definitely
went here in the '90s,

356
00:17:49,807 --> 00:17:52,158
but her professors
don't seem to remember her.

357
00:17:52,201 --> 00:17:55,117
She did a lot of field work
in Poland, I guess.

358
00:17:55,161 --> 00:17:56,814
Zoe Markus?

359
00:17:56,858 --> 00:17:58,468
Yeah, do you know her?

360
00:17:59,556 --> 00:18:02,298
Well, she was my lab partner.

361
00:18:02,342 --> 00:18:04,431
Oh, my God, we dropped
so much acid together.

362
00:18:05,693 --> 00:18:07,216
We went to visit her work.

363
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,739
She's a big financial advisor.

364
00:18:08,783 --> 00:18:11,133
Seriously?

365
00:18:11,177 --> 00:18:12,569
Wow.

366
00:18:12,613 --> 00:18:14,156
I mean, she was really
not into money at all

367
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:15,460
when I knew her and her sisters.

368
00:18:15,485 --> 00:18:16,834
Sisters?

369
00:18:16,878 --> 00:18:18,749
- More than one?
- Yeah.

370
00:18:18,793 --> 00:18:23,754
Beth, Zoe, and Dani who...
no offense... is a little weird.

371
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:26,453
Rumor has it that they averted
apocalypse in senior year.

372
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:43,513
They're good.

373
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:50,346
Janet of House Pluchinsky,

374
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:54,350
versus Faun of House
Kaiko Swordmasters.

375
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,879
Whoo!

376
00:19:05,231 --> 00:19:08,364
Fencicle of House Wahlburger.

377
00:19:19,593 --> 00:19:20,593
What?

378
00:19:24,424 --> 00:19:25,773
Whoa!

379
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:56,238
God.

380
00:20:06,944 --> 00:20:08,294
Goddamn!

381
00:20:08,337 --> 00:20:09,575
We've been wasting her, right?

382
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,837
This is, like,
spy movie perfect.

383
00:20:10,861 --> 00:20:12,254
You're both in the dirty dozen,

384
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:13,449
and I'm the guy on the outside.

385
00:20:13,473 --> 00:20:15,910
Victors, please
approach the dais.

386
00:20:17,303 --> 00:20:18,347
Congratulations.

387
00:20:22,569 --> 00:20:25,659
Fencicle,
what is your persuasion?

388
00:20:25,702 --> 00:20:27,878
I mostly date humans.

389
00:20:27,922 --> 00:20:29,184
Are you a female?

390
00:20:30,925 --> 00:20:32,274
And you, Janet?

391
00:20:32,318 --> 00:20:33,754
Duh.

392
00:20:33,797 --> 00:20:36,974
There can, of course,
only be one female Centurion.

393
00:20:37,018 --> 00:20:39,412
And act three twist.

394
00:20:39,455 --> 00:20:41,283
For all the obvious reasons.

395
00:20:41,327 --> 00:20:43,285
Um, not obvious to me.

396
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:45,809
- I know, dear.
- That's one of the reasons.

397
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,421
You spar by the light

398
00:20:48,464 --> 00:20:51,598
of the glorious double
full moon tomorrow night.

399
00:20:51,641 --> 00:20:53,382
- Tomorrow night?
- That's no good.

400
00:20:53,426 --> 00:20:54,775
- I've got plans.
- Me too.

401
00:20:54,818 --> 00:20:55,950
I mean...

402
00:20:55,993 --> 00:20:59,345
Oh, gravest apologies,
but the schedule...

403
00:20:59,388 --> 00:21:00,650
Chucklebuddy,

404
00:21:00,694 --> 00:21:03,305
I have a sexually
transmitted curse.

405
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:05,655
Sun goes down tomorrow,
I go wolf.

406
00:21:05,699 --> 00:21:06,961
- This guy goes wolf.
- Hi.

407
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,486
Ember's balls.

408
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,621
And her, too, for some reason.

409
00:21:16,405 --> 00:21:17,711
That what you want here?

410
00:21:17,754 --> 00:21:18,973
Sure to be entertaining.

411
00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:22,846
Probably be everyone
in here's last show.

412
00:21:27,373 --> 00:21:29,462
- Reschedule the mimes.
- Yes, sir.

413
00:21:29,505 --> 00:21:31,028
Your match will occur

414
00:21:31,072 --> 00:21:33,335
in the hour before
sundown tomorrow.

415
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:43,302
Margo, Josh and I only...
six or seven or...

416
00:21:43,345 --> 00:21:46,392
it was less than a dozen times,
give or take,

417
00:21:46,435 --> 00:21:48,021
and we would have never,
ever done it if we had known...

418
00:21:48,045 --> 00:21:49,743
Excuse me.

419
00:21:50,787 --> 00:21:53,007
I need to sharpen my axe.

420
00:21:55,662 --> 00:21:58,969
Well, please say something
nice at my funeral.

421
00:22:03,931 --> 00:22:05,889
So, Loria.

422
00:22:07,238 --> 00:22:09,850
I was making ends meet
selling rare objects.

423
00:22:09,893 --> 00:22:12,374
Of course, when I got there,
I mostly drank.

424
00:22:12,418 --> 00:22:14,855
I think this story's
making me sound much less

425
00:22:14,898 --> 00:22:16,857
mentally well-composed
than I actually am.

426
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,207
We are literally camping
on the Sadderhorn.

427
00:22:21,078 --> 00:22:24,473
Anyway, I was at the border
when I saw my first Taker.

428
00:22:24,517 --> 00:22:26,519
That thing you did...

429
00:22:26,562 --> 00:22:30,087
I tried to throw something
at one earlier, and nothing.

430
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:32,133
Well, most things don't work.

431
00:22:32,176 --> 00:22:34,875
Well, the Dark King
can fend them off.

432
00:22:34,918 --> 00:22:37,356
There are a few of us out
here who figured out ways.

433
00:22:37,399 --> 00:22:38,966
How?

434
00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:41,403
When it touched me, it...
it felt like a virus,

435
00:22:41,447 --> 00:22:43,231
a plague.

436
00:22:43,274 --> 00:22:46,103
I shot something off
on instinct, an anti-viral.

437
00:22:46,147 --> 00:22:48,236
You're a Magician from Earth?

438
00:22:48,279 --> 00:22:51,021
My family is.

439
00:22:51,065 --> 00:22:53,067
Well, do you think you can
show us what you did?

440
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:55,548
I... I will teach you
whatever I can.

441
00:22:55,591 --> 00:22:59,029
And something else
I can share...

442
00:22:59,073 --> 00:23:01,467
Lucky that the Taker
didn't snatch it.

443
00:23:03,033 --> 00:23:04,426
Thank you.

444
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:07,821
- Is that Lorian Bumble Wine?
- Uh-huh.

445
00:23:07,864 --> 00:23:10,563
Cures altitude sickness,
opens the lungs,

446
00:23:10,606 --> 00:23:12,303
and gets you smashed.

447
00:23:13,957 --> 00:23:14,958
Wait, I was gonna...

448
00:23:15,002 --> 00:23:16,177
I was gonna say,

449
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,134
you should go easy on that.

450
00:23:17,178 --> 00:23:19,049
Oh, my God.

451
00:23:19,093 --> 00:23:21,356
It's too late now.
I'm sorry.

452
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,966
- Well, cheers to that.
- Mm.

453
00:23:25,969 --> 00:23:27,101
Mm.

454
00:23:27,144 --> 00:23:30,147
- You're a danger tourist?
- No.

455
00:23:30,191 --> 00:23:31,235
Mourning someone.

456
00:23:32,236 --> 00:23:33,977
Who was it?

457
00:23:34,021 --> 00:23:35,544
I mean, if you want to say.

458
00:23:35,588 --> 00:23:36,893
Well...

459
00:23:39,113 --> 00:23:40,593
The love of my life.

460
00:23:40,636 --> 00:23:43,552
Died ridiculously young,
but he was a Magician,

461
00:23:43,596 --> 00:23:45,356
and there's nothing
more dangerous than that.

462
00:23:46,512 --> 00:23:48,383
My dreams were
so filled with him,

463
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,211
I was convinced
he was haunting me.

464
00:23:51,255 --> 00:23:54,607
So I took his diary up
to the top of the mountain

465
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,565
and threw it in.

466
00:23:58,654 --> 00:24:02,223
I felt a little better,
so who knows?

467
00:24:02,266 --> 00:24:05,400
- But you're here again.
- I come every year.

468
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,401
To honor him.

469
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,230
My boyfriend died.

470
00:24:09,273 --> 00:24:10,536
Well, my on and off again...

471
00:24:10,579 --> 00:24:13,887
it was... it's complicated.

472
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:16,150
I don't like talking about it.

473
00:24:16,193 --> 00:24:17,543
I understand.

474
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,026
You knew him too?

475
00:24:24,375 --> 00:24:27,291
Um... good friend.

476
00:24:29,642 --> 00:24:31,513
It's nice that you
can do this together.

477
00:24:31,557 --> 00:24:34,037
Yes, cheers to that too.

478
00:24:37,998 --> 00:24:39,608
Well, I think
I should start thinking

479
00:24:39,652 --> 00:24:43,003
about going to lie down so...
my eggs are scrambled.

480
00:24:43,046 --> 00:24:44,352
They sure are.

481
00:24:51,707 --> 00:24:52,926
Hi, Daniella?

482
00:24:55,189 --> 00:24:56,669
Awkward.

483
00:24:56,712 --> 00:24:58,540
Um, we didn't mean to scare you.

484
00:24:58,584 --> 00:25:00,300
We just wanted to talk
to you and your sister about...

485
00:25:00,324 --> 00:25:02,022
What the hell are you doing?

486
00:25:02,065 --> 00:25:03,545
I told you we can't help you.

487
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:05,547
- You can, but you won't.
- Hey, look.

488
00:25:05,591 --> 00:25:08,115
We're not asking you
to join the fight.

489
00:25:08,158 --> 00:25:09,029
We just need your help in the...

490
00:25:09,072 --> 00:25:10,552
It's not just.

491
00:25:10,596 --> 00:25:13,163
You think she'll stop
if she knows the stakes?

492
00:25:13,947 --> 00:25:15,387
- Tell me about the problem.
- Don't!

493
00:25:15,426 --> 00:25:17,559
Unless you wanna explain
how obsessed you get,

494
00:25:17,603 --> 00:25:18,560
how you nearly
got yourself killed,

495
00:25:18,604 --> 00:25:20,606
how Beth did get killed.

496
00:25:23,696 --> 00:25:26,176
- Look, we're sorry.
- I'm not.

497
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,580
Look, I get that you've
lost a lot,

498
00:25:27,613 --> 00:25:29,484
but so have we.

499
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,530
We need your help.
I'm just saying...

500
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:33,401
We already saved the world,
okay?

501
00:25:33,444 --> 00:25:36,056
We get to be done.

502
00:25:36,099 --> 00:25:37,666
Now get out.

503
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:39,363
Don't come back.

504
00:25:42,628 --> 00:25:47,067
There is nothing like
two grieving lunatics

505
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:50,592
drinking themselves to death
on a mountain of ghosts.

506
00:25:50,636 --> 00:25:52,463
Cheers.

507
00:25:52,507 --> 00:25:54,465
Mm.

508
00:25:54,509 --> 00:25:56,555
Oh, it's a good sky tonight.

509
00:26:00,515 --> 00:26:01,603
Please.

510
00:26:12,658 --> 00:26:15,182
I used to do this with him.

511
00:26:15,225 --> 00:26:19,360
We'd go somewhere, camp out,

512
00:26:19,403 --> 00:26:23,407
and use illusion magic to
change the color of the stars.

513
00:26:26,323 --> 00:26:27,977
Sounds perfect.

514
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:37,596
Have you ever had love?

515
00:26:42,252 --> 00:26:44,385
- Love?
- Uh, like...

516
00:26:44,428 --> 00:26:46,256
- Love.
- It's okay.

517
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,302
You can say anything.

518
00:26:48,345 --> 00:26:50,043
I'm a stranger and you're drunk.

519
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,399
The friend
we're putting to rest.

520
00:27:00,096 --> 00:27:01,663
Wasn't just a friend.

521
00:27:03,578 --> 00:27:06,668
- Does she know?
- Oh, God, no.

522
00:27:06,712 --> 00:27:09,497
A torrid secret affair.

523
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:12,152
Nothing like that.

524
00:27:12,195 --> 00:27:13,501
Hmm.

525
00:27:13,544 --> 00:27:14,720
It seems a bit selfish, then.

526
00:27:16,547 --> 00:27:19,550
I'm just saying that seems
rather important information

527
00:27:19,594 --> 00:27:22,118
that he can't give her.

528
00:27:22,728 --> 00:27:24,088
I mean,
why punish her like that?

529
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,427
Why spare her?

530
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:28,211
You don't seem close.

531
00:27:29,212 --> 00:27:32,085
Because she really,
really loved him.

532
00:27:32,128 --> 00:27:33,652
So did you.

533
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:35,088
Yeah.

534
00:27:35,131 --> 00:27:37,177
So I don't her want to think...

535
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:40,136
Have you ever noticed
that people generally

536
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,703
think what the hell they want?

537
00:27:41,747 --> 00:27:43,487
I'm starting to think that

538
00:27:43,531 --> 00:27:45,098
you're a little bit
of a shit-stirrer.

539
00:27:48,579 --> 00:27:51,191
I just fundamentally believe
that the best way

540
00:27:51,234 --> 00:27:53,497
to honor someone
is with the truth of them.

541
00:27:53,541 --> 00:27:55,369
You could give her more
of that truth,

542
00:27:55,412 --> 00:27:56,849
but you won't.

543
00:27:56,892 --> 00:27:58,435
I just want everybody
to remember Quentin

544
00:27:58,459 --> 00:27:59,721
however they want to

545
00:27:59,765 --> 00:28:02,419
and to... to get through
the fucking day.

546
00:28:02,463 --> 00:28:04,857
I'm just pointing out,

547
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,598
what you've got
in that secret pocket

548
00:28:07,642 --> 00:28:10,253
could help her remember
the real Quentin.

549
00:28:18,435 --> 00:28:20,742
Death is so simple,

550
00:28:20,786 --> 00:28:24,224
and life is so complicated.

551
00:28:24,267 --> 00:28:25,747
I know.

552
00:28:32,449 --> 00:28:34,669
Well...

553
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,716
I should go to bed.

554
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:39,892
Before things get
any more complicated.

555
00:28:51,251 --> 00:28:53,340
Years ago,

556
00:28:54,645 --> 00:28:57,344
the Dark King, in a show
of progressiveness,

557
00:28:57,387 --> 00:28:59,738
allowed that there
might be a female

558
00:28:59,781 --> 00:29:03,045
among his Centurions
if one proved worthy.

559
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:09,269
This year we have two
competitors of the weaker sex.

560
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,011
I know, I know.

561
00:29:12,054 --> 00:29:14,230
- Or you could walk away.
- Can't.

562
00:29:14,274 --> 00:29:15,754
This is for Fillory.

563
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:17,886
You're a little wolf crazy
right now, and mad.

564
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:19,322
You might actually kill her.

565
00:29:19,366 --> 00:29:21,126
I know how to properly
lightly maim someone.

566
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,673
Thanks for your concern.

567
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:26,895
Janet Fencicle,
let the battle commence!

568
00:29:33,989 --> 00:29:35,686
You smell anxious.

569
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:38,907
And you smell angry,
so please let me stab you.

570
00:29:38,951 --> 00:29:42,258
- You are out of your mind.
- Margo, please.

571
00:29:42,302 --> 00:29:45,000
Actually worked.

572
00:29:45,044 --> 00:29:46,412
That's no fair,
'cause you can do magic.

573
00:29:46,436 --> 00:29:48,177
You can do that
twirly knife shit.

574
00:29:48,221 --> 00:29:50,179
- You have an axe.
- Fine.

575
00:29:50,223 --> 00:29:52,007
No magic.

576
00:30:04,498 --> 00:30:06,805
Magic.

577
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,328
Oops.

578
00:30:25,214 --> 00:30:28,130
We have a victor...
a victorette.

579
00:30:31,177 --> 00:30:34,310
Your new lady Centurion.

580
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,011
I'm so sorry, Fen.

581
00:30:48,107 --> 00:30:50,761
That was so well played!

582
00:30:50,805 --> 00:30:53,895
How you knew to grab my knife.

583
00:30:53,939 --> 00:30:55,244
Did I know that?

584
00:30:55,288 --> 00:30:56,202
- Of course you did.
- Childsplay knife.

585
00:30:56,245 --> 00:30:57,507
Perfectly safe.

586
00:30:57,551 --> 00:30:59,391
We make them for children
so they can practice.

587
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,906
Sir, can you please bring us
to the werewolf cages?

588
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:06,342
Quickly?
Thanks.

589
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:22,097
I think I'll take the east view.

590
00:31:22,141 --> 00:31:24,404
I'll find you later if you want
to hike down together.

591
00:31:46,513 --> 00:31:48,210
I'll just give you a moment.

592
00:31:49,342 --> 00:31:50,865
No, stay.

593
00:31:54,216 --> 00:31:55,914
You cared about him too.

594
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:07,055
Do you think it goes all
the way down to the Underworld?

595
00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:09,840
I hope so, for Q.

596
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:20,286
Is there anything
you want to say to him?

597
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:33,299
Rest.

598
00:32:39,305 --> 00:32:41,133
Okay, I think we can go now.

599
00:32:43,048 --> 00:32:45,441
Wait, there's one more thing.

600
00:32:45,485 --> 00:32:47,356
Uh...

601
00:32:57,497 --> 00:32:59,368
Wait, this stamp is enchanted.

602
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:06,071
- You could send this to him.
- Mm-hmm.

603
00:33:06,114 --> 00:33:08,551
Before... oh, my God, Eliot.

604
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,488
You didn't send it 'cause
you were worried it could be...

605
00:33:12,512 --> 00:33:14,035
So much worse if I changed it.

606
00:33:16,951 --> 00:33:20,607
- Alice...
- Huh?

607
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:24,045
Is there a way that we
could really, truly know?

608
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:26,961
Eliot, I really don't know.

609
00:33:30,486 --> 00:33:33,663
S... sometimes I just wish
if you all just went faster,

610
00:33:33,707 --> 00:33:34,707
if you just...

611
00:33:36,144 --> 00:33:38,233
Just locked the fucking door.

612
00:33:38,277 --> 00:33:40,453
No, because Everett
would still...

613
00:33:40,496 --> 00:33:42,150
- Right, Everett.
- Of course.

614
00:33:44,109 --> 00:33:46,328
Q...

615
00:33:46,372 --> 00:33:48,330
If Q hadn't stopped
Everett, then...

616
00:33:48,374 --> 00:33:50,332
So many more people could die.

617
00:33:50,376 --> 00:33:53,509
But I just keep thinking if...
if I can just crack the code

618
00:33:53,553 --> 00:33:54,684
then... then we can fix it.

619
00:33:54,728 --> 00:33:56,053
I don't think there's
a perfect code

620
00:33:56,077 --> 00:33:58,297
for changing the past.

621
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,212
I can't send it,

622
00:34:00,255 --> 00:34:03,476
but I... I can't just let go.

623
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:06,000
It's okay.

624
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,089
He was your friend.

625
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:10,309
He wasn't just my friend.

626
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,493
I'm sorry.

627
00:34:22,669 --> 00:34:24,453
He loved you.

628
00:34:24,497 --> 00:34:27,108
I... why would I want to take
that away from you now?

629
00:34:27,152 --> 00:34:28,501
That would be so cruel.

630
00:34:30,329 --> 00:34:32,244
You really think
I didn't know there was more?

631
00:34:38,598 --> 00:34:40,948
I knew Q really well.

632
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:44,212
And if anyone was messy,
it was him.

633
00:34:46,562 --> 00:34:47,562
Yeah.

634
00:34:49,435 --> 00:34:51,959
He was pretty in love with you.

635
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:55,745
I'm not sure that I'd say that.

636
00:34:55,789 --> 00:34:56,789
I would.

637
00:34:59,793 --> 00:35:03,101
What was I supposed to do, huh?

638
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:05,103
Demand that he only love me?

639
00:35:07,453 --> 00:35:10,238
Scream at him to be
a less complicated person?

640
00:35:10,282 --> 00:35:12,110
I mean, it's Quentin
we're talking about.

641
00:35:14,721 --> 00:35:17,071
And I loved him.

642
00:35:19,465 --> 00:35:22,294
The real him, all of him.

643
00:35:25,297 --> 00:35:28,300
Well, um, there's something

644
00:35:28,343 --> 00:35:29,663
he probably didn't
tell you about.

645
00:35:29,692 --> 00:35:32,478
The mosaic.

646
00:35:33,696 --> 00:35:37,526
Um, there was this timeline.

647
00:35:39,354 --> 00:35:43,445
We somehow remembered
pieces of it,

648
00:35:43,489 --> 00:35:45,621
but these, uh...
these beautiful pieces,

649
00:35:45,665 --> 00:35:48,102
and it was...

650
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:52,367
We loved each other
for a really, really long time,

651
00:35:52,411 --> 00:35:55,762
and, um, so, you know, uh,

652
00:35:55,805 --> 00:35:57,503
I promptly told him to fuck off,

653
00:35:57,546 --> 00:36:00,549
and... and, you know,
he... he... he died for me.

654
00:36:08,731 --> 00:36:09,732
Eliot.

655
00:36:12,474 --> 00:36:16,086
Eliot, I have done...

656
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:22,658
A lot of bad things,
and I have hurt people, okay?

657
00:36:22,702 --> 00:36:25,487
And the one thing that
I hold onto is that I know,

658
00:36:25,531 --> 00:36:29,230
deep down,
that I was doing my best.

659
00:36:29,274 --> 00:36:31,754
Were you doing
the best that you could?

660
00:36:31,798 --> 00:36:34,235
Unfortunately at the time...

661
00:36:35,889 --> 00:36:37,325
Yes.

662
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:41,851
I never even got
to talk to him again.

663
00:36:41,895 --> 00:36:44,376
He just died.

664
00:36:44,419 --> 00:36:47,205
I'm sorry.

665
00:36:47,248 --> 00:36:50,251
Yeah, file it under things
I wish I could say

666
00:36:50,295 --> 00:36:52,819
in this fucking letter
that I can't actually send.

667
00:36:55,474 --> 00:36:57,215
But I can't let go of it,
either.

668
00:36:58,912 --> 00:37:01,262
You want my help?

669
00:37:05,353 --> 00:37:06,353
Yeah.

670
00:37:08,835 --> 00:37:10,445
But we can do it together, okay?

671
00:37:10,489 --> 00:37:12,621
Okay.

672
00:37:12,665 --> 00:37:15,363
On the count of three.

673
00:37:17,278 --> 00:37:19,193
Okay.

674
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,891
- One.
- One.

675
00:37:21,935 --> 00:37:24,285
- Two.
- Two.

676
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:25,591
Three.

677
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,777
That was brave.

678
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,910
He was brave.

679
00:37:40,954 --> 00:37:42,347
You were brave.

680
00:37:52,487 --> 00:37:54,707
Eliot?

681
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:56,186
Yeah?

682
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,537
Thank you for telling me.

683
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:12,072
- Guards, hello!
- We're human again!

684
00:38:15,031 --> 00:38:16,337
Margo.

685
00:38:16,381 --> 00:38:17,599
Can I say one thing?

686
00:38:19,384 --> 00:38:22,778
I'm sorry I slept with Josh.

687
00:38:22,822 --> 00:38:26,216
- We were just lonely.
- Fen, stop apologizing.

688
00:38:27,261 --> 00:38:29,959
I don't own Josh's penis,
and I don't want to.

689
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,920
But you seem...

690
00:38:33,963 --> 00:38:35,922
Can I have a complicated emotion

691
00:38:35,965 --> 00:38:39,055
without having to resolve it
so you can feel better?

692
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:44,757
I am grateful that even
in your complicated state,

693
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,107
you still reached
for the Childsplay knife.

694
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,282
You're a good person...

695
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,849
I thought it was a real knife.

696
00:38:52,286 --> 00:38:56,769
Glad it wasn't today,
but I'm not a good person.

697
00:38:56,812 --> 00:38:59,380
Okay, well,

698
00:38:59,424 --> 00:39:01,730
matters of the heart
can be irrational

699
00:39:01,774 --> 00:39:03,055
and sometimes even
the best of us...

700
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:05,125
Stop trying to forgive me.

701
00:39:05,168 --> 00:39:08,346
We want you to forgive us.

702
00:39:08,389 --> 00:39:10,309
We promised ourselves
we wouldn't give up on you,

703
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,393
but we did.

704
00:39:12,437 --> 00:39:14,917
You never gave up on us.

705
00:39:14,961 --> 00:39:15,875
Yeah, you figured out a way.

706
00:39:15,918 --> 00:39:18,791
Eliot sent the letter.

707
00:39:18,834 --> 00:39:20,793
I was gonna let you die
for Fillory but...

708
00:39:23,186 --> 00:39:24,405
Kings.

709
00:39:26,451 --> 00:39:28,931
We have a job,

710
00:39:28,975 --> 00:39:31,281
and we put it first, right?

711
00:39:33,849 --> 00:39:36,112
So...

712
00:39:36,156 --> 00:39:39,159
you didn't save us,

713
00:39:39,202 --> 00:39:40,378
and then you stabbed me.

714
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,817
Am I a fool?

715
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,775
No... no, really.
Am I?

716
00:39:46,819 --> 00:39:47,776
No more than me.

717
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,082
You're a lovesick idiot!

718
00:39:49,125 --> 00:39:50,344
Hey!

719
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,825
I went into battle for you

720
00:39:52,868 --> 00:39:55,784
thinking that you gave
a single flea on a donkey's ass

721
00:39:55,828 --> 00:39:57,438
for any of us,

722
00:39:57,482 --> 00:39:59,745
thinking that we
owed you something.

723
00:40:02,356 --> 00:40:03,401
Stupid me.

724
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:23,246
I've been thinking
about what Zoe said.

725
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:25,248
It's a valid question.

726
00:40:25,292 --> 00:40:27,120
When do you save
the world enough?

727
00:40:29,557 --> 00:40:31,472
Look, I'm... I'm with you
on anything,

728
00:40:31,516 --> 00:40:33,343
but I gotta be honest.

729
00:40:33,387 --> 00:40:34,997
If we survive this one,

730
00:40:35,041 --> 00:40:37,826
I want a life, Julia.

731
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:39,437
Ideally, with you.

732
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,047
Yeah, I want that too.

733
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:43,528
I'm not sure you do,
and tha... and that's okay.

734
00:40:43,571 --> 00:40:45,051
Right now we got shit to do,

735
00:40:45,094 --> 00:40:47,401
but if we don't die,

736
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,837
we gotta figure this out.

737
00:40:51,318 --> 00:40:52,450
Hello.

738
00:40:53,407 --> 00:40:55,409
I solved your problem.

739
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,933
You were right.
Surges are increasing.

740
00:40:57,977 --> 00:40:59,195
They're unpredictable...

741
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:01,067
hidden variables
that defy calculation.

742
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:03,025
- But if we can't predict it...
- Correct.

743
00:41:03,069 --> 00:41:04,549
You can't.

744
00:41:04,592 --> 00:41:07,290
So instead,
I created a statistical model

745
00:41:07,334 --> 00:41:09,945
to predict a window within
which a surge might occur.

746
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,557
Wow.

747
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,472
Okay, this is a start.

748
00:41:14,515 --> 00:41:17,300
Are you familiar with
the Harmonic Convergence?

749
00:41:17,344 --> 00:41:18,911
No.

750
00:41:18,954 --> 00:41:21,435
A rare and powerful
astrological occurrence.

751
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,958
A magnifier of magic.

752
00:41:23,002 --> 00:41:24,177
There have been four.

753
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:27,136
Extinction of the dinosaurs,
Pompeii,

754
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:31,445
sinking of Atlantis,
and the invention of Auto-Tune.

755
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,142
In two weeks,
there will be a fifth.

756
00:41:33,186 --> 00:41:34,361
How bad will it be?

757
00:41:34,404 --> 00:41:37,146
This is the event
you're worried about.

758
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,583
Circumstances on the Convergence

759
00:41:38,626 --> 00:41:40,367
will be exceptionally favorable,

760
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:43,109
which in this case
is not a good thing,

761
00:41:43,152 --> 00:41:44,545
because it falls
in a surge window.

762
00:41:46,416 --> 00:41:48,462
Castings will be exponentially
magnified.

763
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,029
Enchantments will malfunction.

764
00:41:50,072 --> 00:41:51,334
Death toll in the millions.

765
00:41:51,378 --> 00:41:53,206
- Maybe much higher.
- How can we stop it?

766
00:41:53,249 --> 00:41:56,122
You can't,
unless you stop the surges,

767
00:41:56,165 --> 00:41:57,863
change astrology,

768
00:41:57,906 --> 00:42:00,082
or tell everyone on Earth
not to do magic.

769
00:42:00,126 --> 00:42:01,562
Whatever you try,
if you need help,

770
00:42:01,606 --> 00:42:02,606
I will help you.

771
00:42:03,608 --> 00:42:05,000
And so will my sister.

772
00:42:05,044 --> 00:42:07,089
I'm pretty sure
she doesn't want to.

773
00:42:07,133 --> 00:42:10,528
She doesn't,
but if the moment comes,

774
00:42:10,571 --> 00:42:12,268
you can count on the both of us.

775
00:42:12,312 --> 00:42:14,357
Wait. Dani.

776
00:42:14,401 --> 00:42:16,403
Thank you so much for your help.

777
00:42:16,446 --> 00:42:17,535
My pleasure.

778
00:42:19,014 --> 00:42:20,538
My sister will invoice you
for my time.

779
00:42:25,325 --> 00:42:28,981
Well, we go that-a-way.

780
00:42:29,024 --> 00:42:32,375
A tree near Whitespire
can take us home.

781
00:42:32,419 --> 00:42:36,249
I'm headed in that direction,
if you'd like some company.

782
00:42:36,989 --> 00:42:38,643
- Um, yeah.
- We wouldn't mind.

783
00:42:40,166 --> 00:42:42,603
Make way!

784
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,912
Is that the Dark King's
carriage?

785
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:52,526
Are we in trouble again?

786
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,049
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

787
00:43:11,327 --> 00:43:13,895
Would you like a ride
to Whitespire?

788
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:15,699
- Uh...
- I think we'll walk.

789
00:43:15,723 --> 00:43:18,639
Um...

790
00:43:18,683 --> 00:43:21,990
I hope your journey gave you
everything that you needed.

791
00:43:23,122 --> 00:43:24,427
Please call on me

792
00:43:24,471 --> 00:43:26,647
if there's ever anything
I can do for you.

793
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,265
He's...

794
00:43:39,138 --> 00:43:41,923
I think I almost
fucked the Dark King.
