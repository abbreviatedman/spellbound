combination of thinking I'm incompetent

177
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,171
and your guilt that
he died saving you.

178
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,540

You are way too smart

179
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,341
for me to ascribe what you
just said to total stupidity,

00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,158

with you and Margo?

189
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,461

was thinking more that one time

where you betrayed all of us,

191

Q died cleaning up the mess.

exactly like the Physical Kids' Cottage?

I'm a professor at Brakebills.

with? Stocks, you said?

to talk to your sister Daniella.

Well, we stopped
that, and a lot worse.

there were side effects.

260

Like the surges. Which
are... Getting stronger.

heading towards a major event.

to predict when
it's going to happen.

if either is full, then wolf time.

was convinced he was haunting me.

So, I took his diary up to the
top of the mountain and threw it in.

so who knows?

even the best of us...

708
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:02,673
Stop trying to forgive me.

709
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:04,676
We want you to forgive us.

710
00:39:06,044 --> 00:39:09,640
We promised ourselves we
wouldn't give up on you, but we did.

711
00:39:10,215 --> 00:39:11,342
You never gave up on us.

712
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:14,712
Yeah, you figured out a
way. Eliot sent the letter.

713
00:39:16,387 --> 00:39:18,379
I was gonna let
you die for Fillory.

714
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:22,320
But kings...

715
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:29,164
We have a job and
we put it first. Right?

716
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:35,500
So, you didn't save us,

717
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,138
and then you stabbed me.

718
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:41,569
Am I a fool?

719
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,042
No, really. Am I?

720
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:45,415
No more than me.

721
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:47,417
You're a lovesick idiot! Hey.

722
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,884
I went into battle for you.

723
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,358
Thinking that you gave a
single flea on a donkey's ass

724
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:54,551
for any of us.

725
00:39:55,193 --> 00:39:57,560
Thinking that we
owed you something.

726
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:01,359
Stupid me.

727
00:40:17,382 --> 00:40:20,113
I've been thinking
about what Zoe said.

728
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,584
It's a valid question.

729
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:24,780
When do you save
the world enough?

730
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:26,890
(SCOFFS)

731
00:40:27,492 --> 00:40:29,120
Look, I'm with you on anything,

732
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:31,025
but I gotta be honest.

733
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:32,561
If we survive this one,

734
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,360
I want a life, Julia.

735
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,661
Ideally with you.

736
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:38,666
Yeah, I want that, too.

737
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,239
I'm not sure you
do, and that's okay.

738
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:44,499
Right now we got shit
to do. But if we don't die,

739
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,402
we gotta figure this
out. (KNOCK AT DOOR)

740
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,304
Hello.

741
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,378
I solved your problem.

742
00:40:53,051 --> 00:40:55,452
You were right.
Surges are increasing.

743
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:58,522
They're unpredictable, hidden
variables that defy calculation.

744
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:01,690
But if we can't predict
it... Correct. You can't.

745
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:04,824
So instead, I created
a statistical model

746
00:41:05,063 --> 00:41:07,658
to predict a window within
which a surge might occur.

747
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:10,393
Wow.

748
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,800
Okay, this is a start.

749
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:14,299
Are you familiar with the
Harmonic Convergence?

750
00:41:15,073 --> 00:41:16,073
No.

751
00:41:16,341 --> 00:41:18,970
A rare and powerful
astrological occurrence.

752
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:20,643
A magnifier of magic.

753
00:41:20,712 --> 00:41:23,443
There have been four.
Extinction of the dinosaurs,

754
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:26,277
Pompeii, sinking of Atlantis,

755
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:28,091
and the invention of Auto-Tune.

756
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:30,653
In two weeks,
there will be a fifth.

757
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:34,490
How bad will it be? This is
the event you're worried about.

758
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,317
Circumstances on the Convergence

759
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:37,952
will be exceptionally favorable.

760
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:40,328
Which, in this case,
is not a good thing,

761
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:42,524
because it falls
in a surge window.

762
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:46,096
Castings will be
exponentially magnified.

763
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,638
Enchantments will malfunction.

764
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,901
Death toll in the millions.
Maybe much higher.

765
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:51,704
How can we stop it? You can't.

766
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,173
Unless you stop the
surges. Change astrology.

767
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,508
Or tell everyone on
Earth not to do magic.

768
00:41:57,715 --> 00:42:00,344
Whatever you try, if you
need help, I will help you.

769
00:42:01,452 --> 00:42:02,511
And so will my sister.

770
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:04,553
I'm pretty sure
she doesn't want to.

771
00:42:04,722 --> 00:42:05,815
She doesn't.

772
00:42:06,224 --> 00:42:09,922
But if the moment comes,
you can count on the both of us.

773
00:42:10,228 --> 00:42:11,491
JULIA: Wait, Dani.

774
00:42:12,397 --> 00:42:15,026
Thank you so much for
your help. My pleasure.

775
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,400
My sister will invoice
you for my time.

776
00:42:22,607 --> 00:42:23,607
Well...

777
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:26,402
We go thataway.

778
00:42:28,146 --> 00:42:29,671
Tree near Whitespire
can take us home.

779
00:42:30,148 --> 00:42:33,607
I'm headed in that direction,
if you'd like some company.

780
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,082
We wouldn't mind. Yeah.

781
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:39,485
MAN: Make way! (HORSE WHINNIES)

782
00:42:42,627 --> 00:42:44,528
Is that the Dark
King's carriage?

783
00:42:47,932 --> 00:42:50,060
Are we in trouble again?

784
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:51,964
MAN: Whoa, whoa,
whoa. (HORSE WHINNIES)

785
00:42:58,976 --> 00:43:00,069
(HORSE SNORTING)

786
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:11,079
Would you like a
ride to Whitespire?

787
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:13,451
I think we'll walk.

788
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,583
Um...

789
00:43:16,394 --> 00:43:18,989
I hope your journey gave you
everything that you needed.

790
00:43:20,765 --> 00:43:21,960
Please call on me

791
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:24,001
if there's ever anything
I can do for you.

792
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:33,944
He's...

793
00:43:36,814 --> 00:43:38,840
I think I almost
fucked the Dark King.
