1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,469
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,536 --> 00:00:07,873
On Earth, barely any time has
passed, while here, it's been 300 years.

3
00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:10,420
<i>High King Fen and
Josh the Fresh Prince</i>

4
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:12,174
<i>were overthrown 300 years ago.</i>

5
00:00:12,279 --> 00:00:13,907
The Dark King reigns.
Glory to his rule.

6
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,574
So, tell me. Did you happen
to bring any food with you?

7
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:20,450
A monster rode you around for
months while he murdered people.

8
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:22,587
<i>And then one of your
closest friends died.</i>

9
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,033
<i>The surges are getting worse.</i>

10
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:27,221
I'm just saying, this is the type of
thing I should be using my magic to fix.

11
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:28,818
<i>The apocalypse is happening,</i>

12
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:32,458
but you won't accept my
help because I'm a woman?

13
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:33,533
Quite right.

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,728
My name is Professor Adiyodi.

15
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:38,371
It's not a voice. It's
more like a signal.

16
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:40,668
<i>I'm gonna take down my
wards so you can show me.</i>

17
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,041
Professor?

18
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:44,202
This building. It's missing.

19
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,541
Do you know what kind of skills
it would take to steal a building

20
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:48,843
with Level Five wards?

21
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:51,016
<i>I miss him every day, too.</i>

22
00:00:51,084 --> 00:00:53,849
<i>No one gets to tell
you how to grieve, Alice.</i>

23
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:57,589
If you need to do something
crazy to get through it,

24
00:00:58,525 --> 00:00:59,788
<i>do something crazy, okay?</i>

25
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:26,579
Quentin?

26
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:45,531
Where am I?

27
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:50,664
Where are my pants?

28
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,069
If this is a dream, which
it seems like it's a dream,

29
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,340
shouldn't knowing it's
a dream wake me up?

30
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:03,708
Unless it's a lucid dream,
like that episode of <i>Voyager.</i>

31
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:06,596
Or I've been kidnapped by aliens
who are trying to get secrets out of me

32
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,612
like that other
episode of <i>Voyager.</i>

33
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:12,491
Is something wrong?

34
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:15,358
No. It's just you sound like
someone I used to know.

35
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:20,394
I feel like I'm supposed to
be helping you with something.

36
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,093
Is that weird?

37
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:24,170
No, it isn't weird at all.

38
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:31,742
You're right. This
is a crazy dream.

39
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:34,337
See, this belonged to my
friend, and I can't read it.

40
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:35,939
But you can.

41
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,349
And you're supposed to tell me
what it says, and then you'll wake up.

42
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:51,491
What language is it in?
I was hoping you knew.

43
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:52,760
I've never seen it before.

44
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,903
What? Sorry.

45
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,739
If it was Elvish or Klingon...

46
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,966
This is a really weird dream.

47
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:05,946
Do you have a car? Can
you take me to Taco Bell?

48
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:21,460
Where the hell is
that Portal Tree?

49
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:26,224
You are doing such a great job.

50
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:27,961
Will you promise me something?

51
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:31,569
Mmm? When this is all
over, we can still be friends?

52
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:34,306
No.

53
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,142
Whoa.

54
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:43,344
This isn't real.

55
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,084
Eliot. Hey!

56
00:04:47,187 --> 00:04:49,713
Hey. How are you
talking right now?

57
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,486
I'm dead, not rude.

58
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:53,250
You're a ghost. Am I?

59
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,295
Sorry. It's hard to be mad.

60
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:57,263
I was a terrible High King.

61
00:04:57,531 --> 00:05:00,262
Or that's what a lot of
people screamed at me,

62
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,996
and a lot of strangers
screaming at you can't be wrong.

63
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:06,540
Right. Anyhoo, they hung me.

64
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,464
"Fen out, bitches."

65
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,104
For what it's worth, I am sorry
that I wasn't here to save you.

66
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,077
It's okay. Really.

67
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:18,682
The last I heard, you were
still possessed by The Monster.

68
00:05:19,352 --> 00:05:23,380
And I figured if they did save
you, you'd probably be off drinking.

69
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:28,323
Honestly, I was counting on
Margo to save me. Or Quentin.

70
00:05:28,562 --> 00:05:31,623
Or Alice, or Penny,
or Julia or Dean Fogg.

71
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:34,329
But I know the man I married.

72
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:37,337
Too well, it seems.

73
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,302
Oh, no, look at your sad face.

74
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:41,841
Don't be hard on
yourself. I'm already dead.

75
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:45,845
It's not like you can do some
kind of magic to turn back time.

76
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:47,141
Wait. Unless... Can you?

77
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:49,683
Eliot, if you can save
me, you have to do it.

78
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:52,303
Buzzards are coming
soon to peck out my eyes.

79
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:54,013
My poor dead eyes!

80
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,555
Okay, fine. Jesus. Oh, God!

81
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:57,954
Chill.

82
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,993
Yikes.

83
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,060
Eliot!

84
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:21,510
Which one of you beefy twats
built a Magician-proof dungeon?

85
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:25,917
All right, let's brute
force this mother.

86
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,357
Oh, my God.

87
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:46,639
<i>My friends, if you're reading
this, it's because I'm dead.</i>

88
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,710
<i>Or I escaped and forgot
to get rid of this letter.</i>

89
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:52,109
<i>But probably the
first one. R.I.P. me.</i>

90
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:54,390
<i>We knew something
had gone right on your end</i>

91
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,713
<i>when magic came
back stronger than ever.</i>

92
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:58,775
<i>But then we didn't
hear from you.</i>

93
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,163
- News from the Northern Marsh.
- What about our friends?

94
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:02,632
Have any of the messenger
bunnies returned?

95
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:03,851
Not as of yet.

96
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:06,587
The rabbits believe the connection
between our world and yours

97
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,094
has been disturbed somehow.

98
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,639
They're refusing to
come out of their burrows,

99
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:11,427
no matter how many
cigarettes we offer them.

100
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,757
<i>Days turned into months
with no word from anyone</i>

101
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,065
<i>and no way for us
to return to Earth.</i>

102
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:20,665
Her languorousness Abigail advises
we send our armies to the Northern Marsh

103
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,640
to investigate the
reports of these creatures.

104
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,576
The locals called
them "the Takers."

105
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:29,441
Look, man, I may be drowning my sorrows
in fried chicken, but I'm not an idiot.

106
00:07:29,516 --> 00:07:30,516
We're in over our heads.

107
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,377
That's why we need to
get a message to Margo.

108
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:35,613
<i>We spent so much time
trying to get you back</i>

109
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:37,929
<i>that we didn't see the real
problem right in front of us.</i>

110
00:07:38,258 --> 00:07:40,124
<i>The people rose up against us.</i>

111
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:41,990
On the count of
three, we charge.

112
00:07:42,095 --> 00:07:43,773
But I don't have a weapon.
You are the weapon.

113
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:44,974
I'm just saying, you have two.

114
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,330
One, two, three, charge!

115
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,126
<i>It did not go well for us.</i>

116
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:58,169
<i>Like a dope, I had done some renovations
and made the dungeon Magician-proof.</i>

117
00:07:58,445 --> 00:07:59,445
<i>Oops.</i>

118
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,416
<i>Margo, I hope it's
you who finds this.</i>

119
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:08,080
<i>And I hope you
understand, I did it all for you.</i>

120
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:12,615
<i>Goodbye.</i>

121
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:19,528
Did your pig visitor
tell you about the nature

122
00:08:19,632 --> 00:08:21,624
of this apocalyptic
whatever-the-hell

123
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,135
that's coming to kill us all?

124
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:27,099
No, but Magicians are blowing
themselves up all over the place.

125
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,208
So many that civilians
have caught on. I think...

126
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,144
There's too much
goddamn magic. Yes, I know.

127
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:36,445
Some surges come and go
and hardly anyone notices.

128
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,644
And sometimes it's a clusterfuck

129
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,311
of catastrophe and death.

130
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,797
I'm trying to find a pattern.

131
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,687
Why some surges and not others?

132
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:45,885
Well, if you'd had a
proper Brakebills education,

133
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:47,016
you'd know the answer.

134
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:50,691
Circumstances, dear.

135
00:08:50,764 --> 00:08:53,666
The phase of the moon,
the nearest body of water.

136
00:08:53,733 --> 00:08:55,599
You must factor them
all into your casting.

137
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,501
Even us filthy hedges
know about circumstances.

138
00:08:58,571 --> 00:08:59,664
The trick is

139
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:02,072
certain circumstances
make casting easier.

140
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:03,700
Others make them
much more difficult.

141
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:08,037
Some of the surges must be lining up
with particularly favorable circumstances.

142
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:09,658
Is there any way
to predict them,

143
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:11,514
so we can warn
people in advance?

144
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,520
I may know someone
who can help you.

145
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:16,488
Professor Ex.

146
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,180
Wait. Like the X-Men?

147
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:19,886
No. She's my ex-lover.

148
00:09:20,093 --> 00:09:22,585
I like calling her that
because she hates it.

149
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:26,156
She's a genius at metamath.

150
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,732
Do you feel that? A surge.

151
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:35,235
Damn it.

152
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:38,870
That was Professor Ex's
classroom blowing up.

153
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:41,326
I picked a hell of a
week to quit drinking.

154
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:47,749
I asked around.

155
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:49,619
Nobody knows who
stole the Book Depository.

156
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,583
Did you ask David
Copperfield? Yeah.

157
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,560
Oh.

158
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,926
But a job this big, somebody
should have seen it.

159
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:00,366
All right, look,
my brain is fried,

160
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:05,531
so I either need to get some sleep
or to fry it some more, recreationally.

161
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,737
Well, club soda is as crazy
as I get these days, so...

162
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:11,535
Casual sex then?
Good night, Pete.

163
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:17,182
Good night, boss.

164
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,990
Your friend is like if
cocaine was a person.

165
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,183
Well, it's a hedge bar.

166
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:27,536
That description fits
half the people here.

167
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,619
Not you.

168
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,330
What am I?

169
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:34,729
A Mossad assassin
undercover as a lumberjack?

170
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:42,207
And you play bass in a
J-pop hard metal cover band?

171
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,342
Close. K-pop.

172
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:46,512
Yu-jin.

173
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:49,348
Kady.

174
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,020
Mmm, good morning.

175
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,222
Is it?

176
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,323
Yeah, I know what you mean.

177
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:08,593
I haven't had a night
like that in a while.

178
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,694
I'll just, um... Pants.

179
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:19,310
Uh, if you want to
hang sometime or, heh...

180
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,706
You know, I'm just
gonna stop talking.

181
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:23,839
I'm just...

182
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:33,457
Call... Call me.

183
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:37,086
Finally getting that GED?

184
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:39,629
Have some respect.
I'm a professor.

185
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:44,069
Oh. "Chapter Seven,
Travelling Against Your Will"?

186
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:46,397
That sounds like a problem.

187
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:48,184
One of my students
was hearing this signal,

188
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,074
and when I listened
to it, I just travelled.

189
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:55,045
No idea where, no idea why.
And none of this can explain it.

190
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:58,547
So, just don't listen
to the signal again?

191
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:01,348
Wow. Thank you. Shut up.

192
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,485
Except now I
hear it all the time.

193
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:07,425
This, here, helps
quiet down a bit, but...

194
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:12,090
It's kind of terrifying to lose
control of yourself like that. Yeah.

195
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:13,591
Are you okay?

196
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,902
You know, hangover remedies
are kind of a specialty of mine.

197
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:19,972
I remember.

198
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,706
No judgment or
anything, but I thought...

199
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,074
I'm sober.

200
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:28,507
Well, I was. Almost a year.

201
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:32,575
And here I am, and my head
feels like it's gonna explode.

202
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:36,389
And if I remembered
deciding to have that first drink,

203
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,056
I would tell you why I did it.

204
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,889
You're human. Dust yourself off.

205
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,096
Maybe keep searching for leads

206
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:45,563
on that vanishing Book
Depository or whatever.

207
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:47,499
What?

208
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,501
That library branch
that got heisted.

209
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,503
You spent all day
yesterday looking for it.

210
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,868
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

211
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,577
Are you sure you're
just hungover?

212
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:05,476
Did you get my tacos?

213
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,321
I got one of
everything they had.

214
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,095
Whose house is this? My mom's.

215
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:16,889
Where is she?

216
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,159
She's at a sex... She's camping.

217
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:22,899
This is a really long dream.

218
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:24,130
Mmm-hmm.

219
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,669
Hey. Oh, God.

220
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:30,641
What? Oh, hi.

221
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,942
Um, look, I need help
with a metamath problem.

222
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:36,210
The professor who specializes
in it at Brakebills blew herself up,

223
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,114
so I figured, next
best thing, right?

224
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:40,283
Yeah, you know,
now's not a good time.

225
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,680
My cousin's here from Canada,

226
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,316
and, well, he's Canadian,
so, anyway, I've got to go.

227
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:47,392
Alice.

228
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,795
That's... That's Quentin.

229
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,467
What the hell did you do?

230
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,120
Hello.

231
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:18,957
Oh, shit.

232
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:21,820
So, what do you say?

233
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,556
Wanna go back in time,

234
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:27,361
save my friends, and un-fuck
history for old times' sake?

235
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:29,727
If I change anything,

236
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:32,829
it could undo every sacrifice
we've all made to stop The Beast.

237
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:36,501
Why did you build a workshop
full of time travel gadgets

238
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:37,976
if you aren't
willing to use them?

239
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:42,145
The lesson that I've learned from
a life of trying to change the past is,

240
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,912
well, you almost always
make things worse.

241
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:48,815
Speaking of, where is
my little Volunteer Tomato?

242
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,516
Volunteer, um...

243
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,081
Quentin, my dear.

244
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,928
He died saving me.

245
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,062
Saving everybody.

246
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:05,538
Stiff upper lip, hey?
Positively British of you.

247
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:07,683
Someone's gotta
keep it together.

248
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:09,369
Is that what you
think you're doing?

249
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:15,945
Back when Quentin first came
to Fillory in the very first timeline,

250
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:17,311
he was running from grief.

251
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:22,044
His best friend had
died, tragically. Julia.

252
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:24,022
You.

253
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,226
A victim of your own vices.

254
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,929
I was worried that I was
taking advantage of him,

255
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:33,561
of his sorrow.

256
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:36,429
So the first change I
made was to save you.

257
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:39,401
To see if he would
still answer Fillory's call,

258
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,096
and he did.

259
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:43,300
And then he died.

260
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:45,805
Thirty-nine times.

261
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,845
I'd hoped this time
would be different.

262
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:51,981
It still could be.

263
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:55,680
You saved him 39
times. Why not 40?

264
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,051
Because he won.

265
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:59,455
If you took away his sacrifice,

266
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,391
you'd lose everything
that it brought you.

267
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:04,287
Your life, and the lives
of everyone around you.

268
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:08,129
Same with your friends
Josh and... Was it "Flen"?

269
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,795
It was not.

270
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,501
You have to let
go of the past, Eliot.

271
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:15,174
Let the dead stay dead.

272
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,148
Time is a
motherfucker, isn't it?

273
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:30,689
Ah. Tea's ready.

274
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:44,667
Oh, shit.

275
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,119
Why are you staring
at me? Because...

276
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,986
Holy shit. You look
like somebody I know.

277
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:10,128
My friend Julia.

278
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:12,597
Her grandma.

279
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,328
Yeah. Okay. Great.

280
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,495
Um, you know, I actually
have to talk to Alice,

281
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,766
so maybe you could go
play with rocks or something.

282
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:27,143
So, you built a
golem out of living clay

283
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:30,513
and used the book of Quentin's
life to fill it with his memories?

284
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:33,177
It's not so crazy.

285
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:36,051
And then you animated the
whole thing with his essence?

286
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:40,616
No, it's just a tiny grain of Q's soul
that I pulled from the Underworld.

287
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,195
You wouldn't help
me with a seance,

288
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:45,390
and then you go and do this?

289
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:48,530
Well, I knew it was
risky, but it worked.

290
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:49,762
But it didn't.

291
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,214
That is not the Quentin
you knew. That's...

292
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,230
How could you do
something like this?

293
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:02,242
I found this in Q's
stuff at Brakebills.

294
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:06,551
What is this?

295
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:10,120
I don't know. It's in a
language I've never seen before.

296
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:14,953
It could be a letter, or a diary
or a project he was working on.

297
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:17,428
I thought maybe he
left it for me to find.

298
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,125
So you built the version of
Q that could read this for you.

299
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:24,293
Right, but... He's
12, so he can't.

300
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:25,931
Get rid of it.

301
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:29,271
Put back the piece of Q's essence
that you stole and let him be at rest.

302
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,271
It's not that simple.

303
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,604
The spell keeps the golem alive

304
00:18:34,714 --> 00:18:37,809
until he completes the
task I brought him here to do.

305
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:42,385
So the spell can never be finished
'cause he can't read Q's letter.

306
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,485
This was so insanely selfish.

307
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:53,127
I can't sleep. I can
barely breathe. I...

308
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,859
I needed to fix something,
finish something for him.

309
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,301
Yeah, well, you fucked up.

310
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:01,601
Maybe if we can figure
out how, we can fix it,

311
00:19:01,841 --> 00:19:05,107
and you can put back the piece
of Quentin's soul where it belongs.

312
00:19:11,183 --> 00:19:15,177
I'm glad you called. Last
night was a bit of a blur.

313
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,055
I was hoping for
a second chance.

314
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,789
Kind of a blur for me,
too. Which is why I called.

315
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:24,421
See, I'm sober.

316
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:27,123
I don't remember
drinking last night,

317
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:29,478
but I've got gaps in my
memory, and not just last night.

318
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,279
I can't remember things
that happened days ago.

319
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:32,303
What are you saying?

320
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:35,340
I want to know if
you can explain.

321
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:37,876
You want to know
if I drugged you?

322
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:41,772
I left you my number. I... I
showed up for a second date.

323
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,167
Which is big for me, since I
am terrified of settling down.

324
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:47,129
Oh, maybe I took a chance on you
because you remind me of my cousin

325
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:49,554
who I've been obsessed
with since we were 13.

326
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:50,850
Yes, my first cousin.

327
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:53,722
But our moms are twins,
so genetically my half-sister.

328
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:56,227
Which makes it worse.
Why am I saying all this?

329
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:58,236
Because I truthie-d your drink.

330
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:02,030
You drugged me to
see if I drugged you?

331
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:07,034
You are insane. But I swear,
whatever happened to you, I didn't do it.

332
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,108
I mean, I did some
stuff to you. On you.

333
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,269
I mean with you.
The... The sex stuff.

334
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:15,348
Because you asked, for the
record. God, fucking truth serums.

335
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,278
Wait, wait. Kady. Kady.

336
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:20,819
Um...

337
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:23,586
I got to my building
this morning

338
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,110
and I couldn't remember
which apartment was mine.

339
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,258
I thought, "Hey, crazy night."

340
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:35,297
But seems like, if your memory
was changed, so was mine.

341
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:37,666
I need to know why.

342
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,073
If the beheading didn't kill Josh,
the room service would have.

343
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,910
I'll take your complaint
to the manager.

344
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,086
Eliot?

345
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:58,389
Just in time. The
cell is Margo-proof,

346
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:01,222
and when the Dark King gets
back from his Summer Palace,

347
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:02,317
I'm gonna be executed.

348
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:04,089
What's that?

349
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:05,791
The contents of Jane
Chatwin's garage,

350
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:07,876
which we will use to
take back our kingdom.

351
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,426
My kingdom. But sure.

352
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:15,469
What is this? "Permanence,
for men and women."

353
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:18,035
Ugh.

354
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,339
God, could you ask first?

355
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:23,805
Says this will protect us
from timey-wimey whatever,

356
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,511
so we can change the past and
not erase ourselves in the future.

357
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:27,619
Clutch.

358
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:29,714
What's that?

359
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:33,817
A smoker. Beekeepers use
them to calm down their hives.

360
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:35,986
So that's super-applicable
to our current situation.

361
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:40,832
Wait.

362
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:44,094
Josh would never shut up about
the Royal Bees of Whitespire.

363
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:46,833
They make all the honey
for the castle's kitchens.

364
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:48,635
And they're talking bees.

365
00:21:49,341 --> 00:21:51,469
Okay, all you have to do

366
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,845
is get the bees to deliver a
message to Josh in the past,

367
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:56,176
and then smoke them out.

368
00:21:56,282 --> 00:21:57,306
Huh.

369
00:21:57,383 --> 00:21:58,476
Time bees.

370
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,294
Hello there, bees.

371
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:13,290
Time bees activated.

372
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:17,101
I'm not sure it feels like we
changed the past. At least, not yet.

373
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,797
What are you doing?

374
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:20,499
There used to
be a letter in here.

375
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,173
Huh.

376
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:32,784
It's Fen's.

377
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:36,415
<i>High King Fen here,</i>

378
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:39,492
<i>giving you an update on
life in Castle Whitespire.</i>

379
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:43,996
<i>Babadook hats and open-toed
shoes are the style this season.</i>

380
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:45,361
<i>Ooh, hey, Josh, hey.</i>

381
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:46,694
<i>Get in my Insta Story.</i>

382
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,667
<i>Uh, no. There is
no Insta on Fillory.</i>

383
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:51,260
<i>But... And so this is...</i>

384
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,531
<i>I have three bars.</i>

385
00:22:52,605 --> 00:22:54,445
<i>We're on a different
planet. That's not even...</i>

386
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,804
<i>How do you have three bars?</i>

387
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,845
<i>This is... Whose phone is that?</i>

388
00:22:58,911 --> 00:22:59,911
The time bees.

389
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:01,823
<i>- Oh, God, do you hear that?</i>
- Well played, sister.

390
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,425
<i>Oh, they're saying something.</i>

391
00:23:03,449 --> 00:23:04,659
<i>Fen, I'm allergic to bees!</i>

392
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:05,981
Or maybe not.

393
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:08,180
<i>Oh, Josh! Please help me!</i>

394
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:10,155
<i>Oh! No! I'm being killed!</i>

395
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,282
<i>So many bees!</i>

396
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,690
Did Josh say he was allergic?

397
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:16,628
Right.

398
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,896
That's why Josh would
never shut up about the bees.

399
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:22,758
Oops.

400
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:41,378
I had a friend who
used to do that.

401
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,917
Once he got to the
end of his favorite book,

402
00:23:48,027 --> 00:23:49,586
he'd go back to
the beginning again.

403
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,354
Endings are the worst part.

404
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:56,594
Characters grow up, they
move on, some of them die.

405
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:57,669
It feels like...

406
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,239
Your best friend in the whole
world has abandoned you.

407
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:05,310
I've had this conversation
before. So have I.

408
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:09,212
The therapist my mom sends
me to says I have transition anxiety.

409
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:12,416
As if it's too much to ask
that nothing ever change.

410
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:16,945
Well, your real friends won't
abandon you. That will never change.

411
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:21,985
Or my best friend will start dating
skeevy guys who smoke and spit

412
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:24,859
and she'll forget
I ever existed.

413
00:24:26,065 --> 00:24:28,000
You're just gonna have
to trust me on this one,

414
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:30,801
but the skeevy guys thing

415
00:24:31,103 --> 00:24:32,264
is just a phase.

416
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:34,970
She needs you just as
much as you need her.

417
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:41,605
Excuse me.

418
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:49,515
<i>Well, I tried to find a flaw
in the casting, but I couldn't.</i>

419
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,282
<i>It's him.</i>

420
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:53,952
<i>It's Q.</i>

421
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:55,688
The one I knew at that age.

422
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,157
But the spell...

423
00:24:58,964 --> 00:25:01,365
I've been doing a lot of
reading on circumstances.

424
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:04,634
Not all of them are
astrological. Some of them...

425
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:06,171
Are inside you.

426
00:25:08,974 --> 00:25:10,909
I think you did
that spell perfectly.

427
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:12,354
Your brain might have asked

428
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:14,258
for the version of Q
that could read his letter,

429
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:19,114
but your internal circumstances
asked for something different.

430
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:22,319
Maybe you need to ask
him a different question.

431
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,492
What's that?

432
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:37,195
<i>A History of Fillory,</i>
from the Royal Library.

433
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:38,730
What does it say?

434
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:48,538
"After the Fresh Prince was stung to
death by a swarm of honey-drunk assassins,

435
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:53,846
"High King Fen..." My God,
she listened to the bees.

436
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,618
"She sent an army of soldiers
to hunt down the Dark King.

437
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,021
"A massive manhunt

438
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:02,721
"that was viewed as tyrannical
overreach by the people of Fillory.

439
00:26:02,795 --> 00:26:04,559
"She was overthrown
and executed.

440
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:08,497
"The Takers invaded,
the Dark King still rose."

441
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:14,368
So that's it then?

442
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:19,734
In... In what conceivable
universe is that it?

443
00:26:19,812 --> 00:26:24,512
I'm just saying we're doing all of
this to save a man you ostensibly love,

444
00:26:24,983 --> 00:26:28,385
who died of a bee sting because
you forgot he was allergic.

445
00:26:28,454 --> 00:26:29,615
What is your fucking point?

446
00:26:30,989 --> 00:26:33,424
I was gone. You were alone,
and you hate being alone,

447
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:35,765
and so you grabbed the first
dick that crossed your desk,

448
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:37,626
and now you're having
a hard time letting go.

449
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,764
You think I should let
go of our friends' lives?

450
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:46,170
I think you have a textbook
case of cock-blindness.

451
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:49,708
You are Margo the Destroyer,
not Margo the Pining Girlfriend.

452
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,944
I'm gonna let
your bullshit slide

453
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:58,814
on account of you so recently being
possessed by a homicidal monster.

454
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,315
But I'm not changing my plan.

455
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:04,450
Okay. Okay.

456
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:07,592
Go for it.

457
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:11,929
All right.

458
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:17,001
Wait.

459
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,667
I recognize these.

460
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,108
The first time Jane
came to Fillory by herself,

461
00:27:30,182 --> 00:27:32,117
she was homesick
and missed her brothers.

462
00:27:32,618 --> 00:27:34,058
A forest crone gave
her these stamps.

463
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:38,617
Put them on a letter, address it
to whoever, wherever, whenever,

464
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:40,989
and it gets to them.
This could be our chance.

465
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:43,028
I can just tell Josh
how to fix things.

466
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,433
Find an envelope, address
it to Josh Hoberman,

467
00:27:49,134 --> 00:27:50,134
<i>Castle Whitespire,</i>

468
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:51,864
<i>before he was killed by bees.</i>

469
00:27:56,041 --> 00:27:59,603
<i>Dear Josh, hello from your
friends 300 years in the future.</i>

470
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,670
<i>The bad news is we
can't come back to get you.</i>

471
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,544
<i>The good news, if you
do exactly what I say,</i>

472
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:05,089
<i>you won't be
overthrown and executed.</i>

473
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:06,846
Uh, Fen? You're
gonna want to see this.

474
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:08,997
<i>Those reports
you've been ignoring</i>

475
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:11,650
<i>about an invasion of creatures
in the Northern Marsh?</i>

476
00:28:11,723 --> 00:28:14,852
<i>Stop ignoring them.
Send an army. Today.</i>

477
00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:16,088
I told you we should have.

478
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:18,528
Just shush. Summon the guards!

479
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,633
Everyone, we did it.

480
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:24,701
We scared the Takers back to
wherever the hell they came from.

481
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:25,862
Go us!

482
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:28,533
<i>And somehow,
when we fix the past,</i>

483
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:31,667
<i>I hope we can see
each other again.</i>

484
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:33,811
<i>Love, Margo.</i>

485
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:42,487
The letter disappeared the
moment I closed the mailbox.

486
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,681
It worked.

487
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:48,527
Josh and Fen did a banishment
spell to scare off the Takers,

488
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:49,721
they thought.

489
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,727
Then the creatures came back

490
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,390
and killed Josh and Fen
and everyone in Whitespire.

491
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:58,829
Don't say anything.

492
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:10,415
Okay, it's working.

493
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:15,581
So, how does a homemade psychic
amplifier help if I'm not a psychic?

494
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:18,900
Lowers the bar just enough for the two
of you to be able to connect your minds.

495
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:20,324
We're both missing memories.

496
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,502
If we combine the ones we have,

497
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:23,086
it might be enough
to give us an answer.

498
00:29:23,161 --> 00:29:24,161
Huh.

499
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,630
So, it's like, uh,
memory VR. No.

500
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,158
Are you sure about this?

501
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,759
I'm sure I need to know
what happened to me.

502
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:34,164
You? Same.

503
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:35,432
Don't touch.

504
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,275
Hands together, please.

505
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:48,281
So, where should we start?

506
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,621
Last night. The bar.

507
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:03,164
Your friend is like if
cocaine was a person.

508
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:05,101
Well, it's a hedge bar.

509
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,339
That description fits
half the people here.

510
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:08,839
Not you.

511
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:13,178
Oh... Come on. This
is totally memory VR.

512
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:14,803
Shh.

513
00:30:15,447 --> 00:30:16,540
Now what?

514
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:19,028
A Mossad assassin
undercover as a lumberjack?

515
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:21,677
Now we watch.

516
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:28,390
You play bass in a J-pop
hard metal cover band?

517
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,167
I can look away.

518
00:30:36,635 --> 00:30:38,297
You clearly already remember it.

519
00:30:45,243 --> 00:30:46,302
I don't know.

520
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:49,314
No drugs slipped into our
drinks, no head injuries.

521
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,250
Whatever happened to us,
it seems like we both forgot.

522
00:31:15,974 --> 00:31:16,998
Oh, what the hell?

523
00:31:21,012 --> 00:31:22,446
Stop! What are you doing?

524
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:33,283
Kady, uh, I know
that looked bad.

525
00:31:34,693 --> 00:31:37,629
What the hell was that? What,
some kind of memory spell?

526
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,289
I mean, it looked like it, but I
don't know. I don't remember.

527
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:44,029
Well, what the hell do you remember
then? Why were you at the bar?

528
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:45,900
To drink to. To...

529
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,739
To meet a friend. Who?

530
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:52,310
A Hedge I know from
my first safe house.

531
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:53,470
Show me.

532
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:00,210
That's my friend. She's...

533
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:01,719
The woman that Pete left with.

534
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,655
What are you? What, some
kind of Manchurian Candidate?

535
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:15,097
A sleeper agent that gets activated
to attack women in their bedrooms?

536
00:32:15,734 --> 00:32:18,966
This doesn't make any
sense. What's on the card?

537
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:28,136
I can't make it out. Damn it.

538
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:32,046
I know what's on the card. How?

539
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:34,450
You put your phone number on it.

540
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:36,044
Oh, Kady, wait...

541
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:38,056
So show me who you really are.

542
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:03,674
Someone sent you to
erase my memory. Who?

543
00:33:03,949 --> 00:33:05,110
I have no idea.

544
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:08,514
I never do. I
get a job, I do it.

545
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:12,022
And when it's over, I
make sure I don't remember.

546
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:15,356
You walk around having no
idea what you do for a living?

547
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,656
Why would I want
that on my conscience?

548
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:20,028
Because that's what
a conscience is for.

549
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:22,627
To keep you from
doing fucked-up shit.

550
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:25,535
The world is painful.
That's not gonna change.

551
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:30,199
So I use whatever crutch
I have to to keep going.

552
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:34,340
Point is, you can take
the shiv from my throat,

553
00:33:34,446 --> 00:33:37,348
because I can't rat out
someone I don't remember.

554
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,340
Well, my friend's a psychic.

555
00:33:39,918 --> 00:33:41,195
Why don't I have him root around

556
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:43,347
and see what you do
and don't remember?

557
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:47,283
Then you don't leave
me much choice, Kady.

558
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:52,194
No! Damn it!

559
00:33:52,297 --> 00:33:53,993
Who sent you?

560
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,288
What the hell happened?

561
00:34:07,312 --> 00:34:10,305
I don't know. He just...
He self-destructed.

562
00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:14,947
He's gone.

563
00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:21,469
Telling them to kill the
Dark King was a bust.

564
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:23,428
Same with going
after the Takers.

565
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:27,859
We need a new plan. We
only have two stamps left.

566
00:34:27,933 --> 00:34:31,529
One stamp. After your last
letter to Josh, I had an idea.

567
00:34:31,603 --> 00:34:35,904
I gave it a shot. It didn't
work, so... one stamp.

568
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:38,268
And you didn't tell me?

569
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:40,808
I'm not your subject.
I'm your friend.

570
00:34:41,279 --> 00:34:43,908
Fine. Then what would
you tell Josh to do?

571
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:47,042
Run to the nearest dive
and drink himself to death?

572
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:52,414
Yes. I would run away.

573
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:56,554
Because you try to save your
friends and they die anyway.

574
00:34:57,228 --> 00:35:00,221
You can't stop the Takers and
you can't stop the Dark King.

575
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,792
And if we don't focus on getting
you out, you're gonna get decapitated.

576
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:06,964
Fillory is fucked
because it always is,

577
00:35:07,072 --> 00:35:08,950
and I don't get why you
keep trying to fix something

578
00:35:08,974 --> 00:35:10,237
that wants to be broken.

579
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:11,367
It may be broken,

580
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:12,775
but it's my home.

581
00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:15,971
It hasn't been your
home for 300 years.

582
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:21,381
You are right about one
thing. I have gone soft.

583
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:25,952
I've been telling myself that if I
can just keep Josh from dying,

584
00:35:26,024 --> 00:35:28,391
somehow I can get him
and my kingdom back.

585
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:31,328
But that's not possible. Is it?

586
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:38,193
What are you telling him?

587
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:45,038
I told him he
needs to stay here.

588
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,112
He can use the information
from this history book

589
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:48,669
to fight the Dark
King and the Takers

590
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,011
wherever they show
up for the rest of his life.

591
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,113
I told him goodbye.

592
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:14,672
I'm not dreaming, am I?

593
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,436
I ask because it's
been like a full day,

594
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:21,844
and if you sleep for that
long it's 'cause you're dead.

595
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:32,522
I had this friend who
I loved very much,

596
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,353
and he died.

597
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,326
And I didn't get to say goodbye.

598
00:36:40,265 --> 00:36:44,202
And I honestly don't know how
I'm gonna go on without him.

599
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:47,637
And he gave me this
gift I can never repay.

600
00:36:52,277 --> 00:36:53,472
What was the gift?

601
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,104
His life.

602
00:36:57,916 --> 00:36:59,282
He gave it up for mine.

603
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,220
I brought you here
'cause I wanted closure.

604
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:07,491
You know, I just...

605
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:10,051
I wanted to fix something

606
00:37:10,128 --> 00:37:12,029
or finish something for him.

607
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:17,365
But the letter I showed
you, you couldn't read it, so...

608
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,706
You're skipping to the
beginning of the book.

609
00:37:21,673 --> 00:37:22,673
What?

610
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:27,276
I can't help you because
you don't want me to.

611
00:37:28,113 --> 00:37:30,378
Because then your
friend's story is over.

612
00:37:37,055 --> 00:37:40,617
My dad says when I get sad
about something that's gonna end...

613
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:46,723
I should just imagine this is
the first page in a new book.

614
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:52,961
The gift your friend gave you,

615
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:56,467
it wasn't his life.

616
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:58,942
It was yours.

617
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:01,508
That story just started.

618
00:38:03,515 --> 00:38:04,515
What?

619
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:09,053
I shouldn't be surprised
that even at age 12,

620
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,181
Quentin Coldwater is still
the smartest person I know.

621
00:38:20,932 --> 00:38:22,298
I'm feeling tired.

622
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:25,829
Really tired.

623
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:31,770
Hey, do you want to see a trick?

624
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:33,903
Sure.

625
00:38:53,198 --> 00:38:54,860
That was cool. Yeah.

626
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:07,107
There's just one more thing

627
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,178
I wanted to say.

628
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:15,482
Goodbye, Quentin.

629
00:39:26,164 --> 00:39:27,164
He's gone.

630
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:29,533
Are you okay?

631
00:39:33,705 --> 00:39:36,607
I'm sorry he couldn't give
you the answer you wanted.

632
00:39:39,811 --> 00:39:42,076
No. He did.

633
00:39:48,253 --> 00:39:50,745
Maybe I can still help
you with your problem.

634
00:39:58,263 --> 00:40:04,828
My dad had a friend with a really rare
discipline, predicting circumstances.

635
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:09,299
They lost touch years
ago, but she wrote this.

636
00:40:13,378 --> 00:40:17,179
If anyone can find the pattern
you're looking for, it'll be her.

637
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,543
Thanks.

638
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:23,051
I don't remember any of it.

639
00:40:23,121 --> 00:40:28,958
The Book Depository, the mystery
woman who apparently wiped my memory.

640
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,620
All I know is what
you told me, which...

641
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:32,796
Isn't enough to
do anything with.

642
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:36,010
Somebody's out there with
enough power to steal a building,

643
00:40:36,034 --> 00:40:40,472
paranoid enough to send mind-wiping
sleeper agent assassins after you.

644
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:41,664
It's not nothing.

645
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,902
Well, I need a drink.

646
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,503
Sorry. Insensitive.

647
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:50,142
I'll show myself out.

648
00:40:56,688 --> 00:40:57,986
How are you feeling?

649
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:05,526
And I thought that if I took on
more power and more responsibility,

650
00:41:07,065 --> 00:41:08,533
that I'd want heroin less.

651
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:13,437
But the truth is, when
I thought I'd relapsed,

652
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:15,431
I wasn't disappointed.

653
00:41:16,274 --> 00:41:17,936
I wasn't mad at myself.

654
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:20,411
I was relieved.

655
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,139
It gave me permission
to relapse some more.

656
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:30,088
Trying to lead the hedges,
it's only gonna get harder.

657
00:41:32,457 --> 00:41:35,655
And I'm not sure I can
do it without a crutch.

658
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:41,865
Which maybe means
I shouldn't do it at all.

659
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,196
Hey... No.

660
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:04,186
You never quite get used to the
smell of Fillorian plumbing, do you?

661
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:09,149
Josh. You're alive.

662
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,859
Thanks to you.
I got your letter.

663
00:42:13,398 --> 00:42:15,833
Right. The letter.

664
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,020
I did exactly what you said.

665
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:19,867
I went to the Clock Dwarf,
brought him a ham sandwich

666
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:22,133
and told him to send
me forward 300 years.

667
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,041
Just you?

668
00:42:24,142 --> 00:42:25,770
No. Fen came, too.

669
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:29,405
And Tick, and Rafe and a few
guys from my bowling league.

670
00:42:29,514 --> 00:42:32,746
I started a bowling league.
And about a dozen other people.

671
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:36,583
Nobody cool wanted to stay in the
past once they knew what was coming.

672
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:39,251
I can't believe it.

673
00:42:40,091 --> 00:42:41,320
Look behind the stone.

674
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,162
I hid it there before I left.

675
00:42:57,942 --> 00:42:59,911
Margo, thank you.

676
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:09,447
May I present the government
of High King Margo in exile.

677
00:43:16,561 --> 00:43:18,462
Let's get out of here
before we all get killed.

678
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:20,891
Hey, Margo.
