00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:41,326

week to quit drinking.

stole the Book Depository.

00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,583
Did you ask David
Copperfield? Yeah.

177
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,560
Oh.

178
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,926
But a job this big, somebody
should have seen it.

179
00:09:57,897 --> 00:10:00,366
(SIGHS) All right,
look, my brain is fried,

180
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:05,531
so I either need to get some sleep
or to fry it some more, recreationally.

181
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,737
Well, club soda is as crazy
as I get these days, so...

Good night, Pete.

183
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:17,182
Good night, boss.

cocaine was a person.

199

like that in a while.

Travelling Against Your Will"?

That sounds like a problem.

211
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:48,184
One of my students
was hearing this signal,

212
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,074
and when I listened
to it, I just travelled.

213
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:55,045
No idea where, no idea why.
And none of this can explain it.

214
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:58,547
So, just don't listen
to the signal again?

215
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:01,348
Wow. Thank you. Shut up.

216

Except now I
hear it all the time.

217
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:07,425
This, here, helps
quiet down a bit, but...

218
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:12,090
It's kind of terrifying to lose
control of yourself like that. Yeah.

219

Are you okay?

are kind of a specialty of mine.

I remember.

223
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:23,706
No judgment or
anything, but I thought...

224
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,074
I'm sober.

225
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:28,507
Well, I was. Almost a year.

226
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:32,575
And here I am, and my head
feels like it's gonna explode.

227
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:36,389
And if I remembered
deciding to have that first drink,

228
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,056

Depository or whatever.

yesterday looking for it.

you're talking about.

just hungover?

237

238
00:13:07,887 --> 00:13:09,321

in it at Brakebills blew herself up,

249

so I figured, next

261
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,556
Wanna go back in time,

262
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:27,361
save my friends, and un-fuck
history for old times' sake?

If I change anything,

264
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:32,829
it could undo every sacrifice
we've all made to stop The Beast.

265
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:36,501
Why did you build a workshop
full of time travel gadgets

if you aren't
willing to use them?

267

The lesson that I've learned from
a life of trying to change the past is,

268
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,912
well, you almost always
make things worse.

my little Volunteer Tomato?

Quentin, my dear.

272

keep it together.

Is that what you
think you're doing?

277
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:15,945
Back when Quentin first came
to Fillory in the very first timeline,

278
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:17,311
he was running from grief.

279
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:22,044
His best friend had
died, tragically. Julia.

280
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:24,022
You.

281
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,226
A victim of your own vices.

282
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,929
I was worried that I was
taking advantage of him,

283
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:33,561
of his sorrow.

284
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:36,429
So the first change I
made was to save you.

285
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:39,401
To see if he would
still answer Fillory's call,

286
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,096
and he did.

287
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:43,300
And then he died.

288
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:45,805
Thirty-nine times.

289
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,845
(SIGHS) I'd hoped this
time would be different.

290
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:51,981
It still could be.

291
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:55,680
You saved him 39
times. Why not 40?

292
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,051
Because he won.

293
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:59,455
If you took away his sacrifice,

294
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,391
you'd lose everything
that it brought you.

of everyone around you.

have to talk to Alice,

so maybe you could go
play with rocks or something.

312
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:27,143
So, you built a
golem out of living clay

313
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:30,513
and used the book of Quentin's
life to fill it with his memories?

314

It's not so crazy.

315
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:36,051
And then you animated the
whole thing with his essence?

316
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:40,616
No, it's just a tiny grain of Q's soul
that I pulled from the Underworld.

317
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:44,195
You wouldn't help
me with a seance,

318
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:45,390
and then you go and do this?

319
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:48,530
Well, I knew it was
risky, but it worked.

320
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:49,762
But it didn't.

321
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,214
That is not the Quentin
you knew. That's...

322
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,230
How could you do
something like this?

323
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:02,242
I found this in Q's
stuff at Brakebills.

324
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:06,551
JULIA: What is this?

325
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:10,120
I don't know. It's in a
language I've never seen before.

326
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:14,953
It could be a letter, or a diary
or a project he was working on.

327
00:18:15,061 --> 00:18:17,428
I thought maybe he
left it for me to find.

328
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,125
So you built the version of
Q that could read this for you.

329
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:24,293
Right, but... He's
12, so he can't.

Get rid of it.

331
00:18:26,005 --> 00:18:29,271
Put back the piece of Q's essence
that you stole and let him be at rest.

332
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,271
It's not that simple.

333
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,604

until he completes the
task I brought him here to do.

335
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:42,385
So the spell can never be finished
'cause he can't read Q's letter.

336

out how, we can fix it,

See, I'm sober.

347
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:27,123
I don't remember
drinking last night,

348
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:29,478
but I've got gaps in my
memory, and not just last night.

349
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,279
I can't remember things
that happened days ago.

350
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:32,303
What are you saying?

351
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:35,340
I want to know if
you can explain.

352
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:37,876
You want to know
if I drugged you?

353
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:41,772
I left you my number. I... I
showed up for a second date.

354
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,167
Which is big for me, since I
am terrified of settling down.

355
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:47,129
Oh, maybe I took a chance on you
because you remind me of my cousin

356
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:49,554
who I've been obsessed
with since we were 13.

357
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:50,850
Yes, my first cousin.

358
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:53,722
But our moms are twins,
so genetically my half-sister.

359
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:56,227
Which makes it worse.
Why am I saying all this?

360
00:19:56,996 --> 00:19:58,236
Because I truthie-d your drink.

361
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:02,030
You drugged me to
see if I drugged you?

362
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:07,034
You are insane. But I swear,
whatever happened to you, I didn't do it.

363
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,108
I mean, I did some
stuff to you. On you.

364

I got to my building
this morning

369
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,110
and I couldn't remember
which apartment was mine.

370
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,258
I thought, "Hey, crazy night."

371

was changed, so was mine.

them to calm down their hives.

is get the bees to deliver a
message to Josh in the past,

No. He did.

689
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:46,884
(EXHALES HEAVILY)

690
00:39:48,253 --> 00:39:50,745
Maybe I can still help
you with your problem.

691
00:39:58,263 --> 00:40:04,828
My dad had a friend with a really rare
discipline, predicting circumstances.

692
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:09,299
They lost touch years
ago, but she wrote this.

693
00:40:13,378 --> 00:40:17,179
If anyone can find the pattern
you're looking for, it'll be her.

694
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,543
Thanks.

695
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:23,051
PETE: I don't
remember any of it.

696
00:40:23,121 --> 00:40:28,958
The Book Depository, the mystery
woman who apparently wiped my memory.

697
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,620
All I know is what
you told me, which...

698
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:32,796
PETE: Isn't enough
to do anything with.

699
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:36,010
Somebody's out there with
enough power to steal a building,

700
00:40:36,034 --> 00:40:40,472
paranoid enough to send mind-wiping
sleeper agent assassins after you.

701
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:41,664
It's not nothing.

702
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,902
Well, I need a drink.

703
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,503
Sorry. Insensitive.

704
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:50,142
I'll show myself out.

705
00:40:56,688 --> 00:40:57,986
How are you feeling?

706
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:05,526
And I thought that if I took on
more power and more responsibility,

707
00:41:07,065 --> 00:41:08,533
that I'd want heroin less.

708
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:13,437
But the truth is, when
I thought I'd relapsed,

709
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:15,431
I wasn't disappointed.

710
00:41:16,274 --> 00:41:17,936
I wasn't mad at myself.

711
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:20,411
I was relieved.

712
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,139
It gave me permission
to relapse some more.

713
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:30,088
Trying to lead the hedges,
it's only gonna get harder.

714
00:41:32,457 --> 00:41:35,655
And I'm not sure I can
do it without a crutch.

715
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:41,865
Which maybe means
I shouldn't do it at all.

716
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:49,196
Hey... No.

717
00:41:58,316 --> 00:41:59,545
(WATER DRIPPING)

718
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:04,186
You never quite get used to the
smell of Fillorian plumbing, do you?

719
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:09,149
Josh. You're alive.

720
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,859
Thanks to you.
I got your letter.

721
00:42:13,398 --> 00:42:15,833
Right. The letter.

722
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,020
I did exactly what you said.

723
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:19,867
I went to the Clock Dwarf,
brought him a ham sandwich

724
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:22,133
and told him to send
me forward 300 years.

725
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,041
Just you?

726
00:42:24,142 --> 00:42:25,770
No. Fen came, too.

727
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:29,405
And Tick, and Rafe and a few
guys from my bowling league.

728
00:42:29,514 --> 00:42:32,746
I started a bowling league.
And about a dozen other people.

729
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:36,583
Nobody cool wanted to stay in the
past once they knew what was coming.

730
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:39,251
I can't believe it.

731
00:42:40,091 --> 00:42:41,320
Look behind the stone.

732
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:48,725
(CHUCKLES IN RELIEF)

733
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,162
I hid it there before I left.

734
00:42:57,942 --> 00:42:59,911
Margo, thank you.

735
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:09,447
May I present the government
of High King Margo in exile.

736
00:43:16,561 --> 00:43:18,462
Let's get out of here
before we all get killed.

737
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:20,891
Hey, Margo.
