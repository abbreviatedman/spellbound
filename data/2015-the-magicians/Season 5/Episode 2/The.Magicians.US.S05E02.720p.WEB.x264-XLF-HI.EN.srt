Yeah, okay, great.

Um, you know, I actually
have to talk to Alice,

368
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,942
so maybe you could go play
with rocks or something.

369
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,099
So you built a golem out of living clay

370
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,919
and used the book of Quentin's life

371
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,480

374
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,079
with his essence?

375
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,999
No, it's just a tiny grain of Q's soul

376
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,879

377
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,179
You wouldn't help me with a séance,

378
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,464
and then you go and do this?

379
00:17:52,465 --> 00:17:55,479
Well, I... I knew it was
risky, but it worked.

380
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,439
But it didn't.

381
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,182
That is not the Quentin
you knew. That's...

382
00:17:59,183 --> 00:18:02,519
how could you do something like this?

383
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:09,960
I found this in Q's stuff at Brakebills.

384
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,519
What is this?

385
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,158
I don't know. It's in a language
I've never seen before.

386
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:19,452
It could be a... a letter or a diary

387

or a project he was working on.

388
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,339
I thought maybe he left
it for me to find.

389
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,168
So you built the version of Q
that could read this for you.

390
00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:28,586
Right, but...

391
00:18:28,587 --> 00:18:31,339

essence that you stole

It's not that simple.

396
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:41,599
The spell keeps the golem alive

397
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,145
until he completes the task
I brought him here to do.

398
00:18:45,146 --> 00:18:47,519
So the spell can never be finished

399
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,519
'cause he can't read Q's letter.

400
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,569

Maybe if we can figure
out how, we can fix it

407
00:19:08,756 --> 00:19:10,962
