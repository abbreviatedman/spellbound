have to talk to Alice,

play with rocks or something.

377

So you built a golem
out of living clay

378
00:17:31,224 --> 00:17:33,095
and used the book
of Quentin's life

379
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:35,402
to fill it with his memories?

381

the whole thing

with his essence?

383
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:43,105
No, it's just a tiny grain
of Q's soul

from the Underworld.

with a séance,

386
00:17:48,241 --> 00:17:49,546

00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,332
Well, I... I knew it was risky,
but it worked.

388
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,377
But it didn't.

00:17:54,421 --> 00:17:55,813
That is not the Quentin
you knew.

390
00:17:55,857 --> 00:17:58,468
That's... how could you
do something like this?

391
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:06,302
I found this in Q's stuff
at Brakebills.

392
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:11,438

I've never seen before.

395
00:18:14,267 --> 00:18:16,486
It could be a... a letter
or a diary

396
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,141
or a project he was working on.

397
00:18:19,185 --> 00:18:21,361
I thought maybe
he left it for me to find.

398
00:18:21,404 --> 00:18:24,146
So you built the version of Q
that could read this for you.

399
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,539
Right, but...

400
00:18:25,582 --> 00:18:28,324
He's 12, so he can't.

401
00:18:28,368 --> 00:18:30,152
Get rid of it.

402
00:18:30,196 --> 00:18:31,825

of Q's essence that you stole

403
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:33,329

404
00:18:33,373 --> 00:18:36,419
It's not that simple.

405
00:18:36,463 --> 00:18:38,639
The spell keeps the golem alive

406
00:18:38,682 --> 00:18:42,686
until he completes the task
I brought him here to do.

407
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,471
So the spell
can never be finished

408
00:18:44,514 --> 00:18:47,474
'cause he can't read Q's letter.

409
00:18:47,517 --> 00:18:49,432

finish something for him.

00:19:00,835 --> 00:19:02,489
Yeah, well, you fucked up.

415
00:19:02,532 --> 00:19:05,579
Maybe if we can figure out how,
we can fix it

416
00:19:05,622 --> 00:19:07,842
and you can put back
the piece of Quentin's soul

for a second date,

terrified of settling down.

Oh, maybe I took a chance on you

434
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,233
because you remind me
of my cousin,

since we were 13.

Because I "truthied" your drink.

to see if I drugged you?

00:42:25,412 --> 00:42:28,197
- Just you?
- No, Fen came too.

902
00:42:28,241 --> 00:42:29,982
And Tick, and Rafe,

903
00:42:30,025 --> 00:42:31,592
and a few guys
from my bowling league...

904
00:42:31,636 --> 00:42:33,202
I started a bowling league...

905
00:42:33,246 --> 00:42:35,553
And a dozen other people.

906
00:42:35,596 --> 00:42:37,119
Nobody cool wanted
to stay in the past

907
00:42:37,163 --> 00:42:40,035
once they knew what was coming.

908
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:41,994
I can't believe it.

909
00:42:42,037 --> 00:42:43,952
Look behind the stone.

(LAUGHS SOFTLY)

911
00:42:51,656 --> 00:42:54,049
I hid it there before I left.

912
00:42:59,925 --> 00:43:02,449
Margo, thank you.

913
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:09,021
May I present the government

914
00:43:09,064 --> 00:43:11,893
of High King Margo in exile.

915
00:43:18,683 --> 00:43:20,685
Let's get out of here
before we all get killed.
