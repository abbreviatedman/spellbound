1
00:00:06,484 --> 00:00:09,009
Previously,
on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:10,358 --> 00:00:11,422
On Earth, barely any time
has passed,

3
00:00:11,446 --> 00:00:13,143
while here, it's been 300 years.

4
00:00:13,187 --> 00:00:15,276
High King Fen
and Josh the Fresh Prince

5
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:17,408
were overthrown 300 years ago.

6
00:00:17,452 --> 00:00:19,236
The Dark King reigns.
Glory to his rule.

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,717
So, tell me, did you happen
to bring any food with you?

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,849
A monster
rode you around for months

9
00:00:23,893 --> 00:00:25,808
while he murdered people,

10
00:00:25,851 --> 00:00:27,723
and then one
of your closest friends died.

11
00:00:27,766 --> 00:00:29,203
The surges are getting worse.

12
00:00:30,334 --> 00:00:31,442
I'm just saying,
this is the type of thing

13
00:00:31,466 --> 00:00:32,786
I should be using my magic
to fix.

14
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:34,109
The apocalypse is happening,

15
00:00:35,339 --> 00:00:37,472
but you won't accept my help
because I'm a woman?

16
00:00:37,515 --> 00:00:38,516
Quite right.

17
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,779
My name is Professor Adiyodi.

18
00:00:40,823 --> 00:00:41,780
It's not a voice.

19
00:00:41,824 --> 00:00:43,652
It's more like a signal.

20
00:00:43,695 --> 00:00:46,176
I'm gonna take down my wards
so you can show me.

21
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,525
Professor?

22
00:00:47,569 --> 00:00:49,701
This building, it's missing.

23
00:00:49,745 --> 00:00:51,790
Do you know what
kind of skills it would take

24
00:00:51,834 --> 00:00:54,489
to steal a building
with level five wards?

25
00:00:54,532 --> 00:00:56,317
I miss him every day too.

26
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,102
No one gets to tell you
how to grieve, Alice.

27
00:00:59,146 --> 00:01:01,322
If you need to do
something crazy

28
00:01:01,365 --> 00:01:03,541
to get through it...

29
00:01:03,585 --> 00:01:05,413
do something crazy, okay?

30
00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:31,542
Quentin?

31
00:02:49,256 --> 00:02:50,561
Where am I?

32
00:02:54,348 --> 00:02:55,697
Where are my pants?

33
00:03:00,267 --> 00:03:01,659
If this is a dream...

34
00:03:01,703 --> 00:03:03,313
Which it seems like
it's a dream...

35
00:03:03,357 --> 00:03:05,489
Shouldn't knowing it's a dream
wake me up?

36
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:06,969
Unless it's a lucid dream

37
00:03:07,012 --> 00:03:08,840
like that episode of "Voyager."

38
00:03:08,884 --> 00:03:10,407
Or I've been kidnapped by aliens

39
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:11,645
who are trying
to get secrets out of me,

40
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:13,758
like that other episode
of "Voyager."

41
00:03:16,457 --> 00:03:17,936
- Something wrong?
- No.

42
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:20,461
It's just, you sound
like someone I used to know.

43
00:03:20,504 --> 00:03:22,506
I feel like...

44
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,857
I'm supposed to be helping you
with something.

45
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:27,555
Is that weird?

46
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:29,731
No, it isn't weird at all.

47
00:03:34,388 --> 00:03:36,694
You're right.
This is a crazy dream.

48
00:03:36,738 --> 00:03:38,305
See, this belonged to my friend,

49
00:03:38,348 --> 00:03:39,871
and I can't read it.

50
00:03:39,915 --> 00:03:42,570
But you can,
and you're supposed to tell me

51
00:03:42,613 --> 00:03:45,225
what it says
and then you'll wake up.

52
00:03:53,842 --> 00:03:55,322
What language is it in?

53
00:03:55,365 --> 00:03:56,584
I was hoping you knew.

54
00:03:56,627 --> 00:03:58,673
I've never seen it before.

55
00:03:58,716 --> 00:03:59,717
What?

56
00:03:59,761 --> 00:04:02,024
Sorry.

57
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:05,462
If it was Elvish or Klingon...

58
00:04:05,506 --> 00:04:07,377
This is a really weird dream.

59
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:09,466
Do you have a car?

60
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,902
Can you take me to Taco Bell?

61
00:04:23,915 --> 00:04:26,483
Where the hell is that
portal tree?

62
00:04:28,137 --> 00:04:31,445
You are doing such a great job.

63
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:33,011
Will you promise me something?

64
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:35,579
When this is all over...

65
00:04:35,623 --> 00:04:37,320
we can still be friends?

66
00:04:37,364 --> 00:04:38,321
Meh.

67
00:04:38,365 --> 00:04:39,757
No!

68
00:04:42,369 --> 00:04:43,544
Whoa.

69
00:04:46,938 --> 00:04:49,593
This isn't real.

70
00:04:49,637 --> 00:04:51,769
Eliot! Hey!

71
00:04:51,813 --> 00:04:52,857
Hey.

72
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:54,598
How are you talking right now?

73
00:04:54,642 --> 00:04:56,687
I'm dead, not rude.

74
00:04:56,731 --> 00:04:58,428
- Oh, you're a ghost.
- Am I?

75
00:04:58,472 --> 00:05:00,343
- Sorry.
- It's hard to be mad.

76
00:05:00,387 --> 00:05:02,606
I was a terrible High King.

77
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:05,392
Or that's what a lot
of people screamed at me,

78
00:05:05,435 --> 00:05:07,132
and a lot of strangers
screaming at you

79
00:05:07,176 --> 00:05:08,133
can't be wrong.

80
00:05:08,177 --> 00:05:09,526
Right.

81
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,920
Anyhoo, they hung me.

82
00:05:11,963 --> 00:05:13,922
Fen out, bitches.

83
00:05:13,965 --> 00:05:15,358
For what it's worth,

84
00:05:15,402 --> 00:05:18,361
I am sorry that I wasn't
here to save you.

85
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:20,798
It's okay, really.

86
00:05:20,842 --> 00:05:22,017
The last I heard,

87
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,454
you were still possessed
by The Monster.

88
00:05:24,498 --> 00:05:26,587
And I figured
if they did save you,

89
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,980
you'd probably be off drinking.

90
00:05:29,024 --> 00:05:32,462
Honestly, I was counting
on Margo to save me.

91
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:34,812
Or Quentin or Alice or Penny

92
00:05:34,856 --> 00:05:36,553
or Julia or Dean Fogg,

93
00:05:36,597 --> 00:05:39,600
but I know the man I married.

94
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:42,385
Too well, it seems.

95
00:05:42,429 --> 00:05:44,735
Oh, no, look at your sad face.

96
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:46,998
Don't be hard on yourself.
I'm already dead.

97
00:05:47,042 --> 00:05:49,392
It's not like you can
do some kind of magic

98
00:05:49,436 --> 00:05:50,828
to turn back time...

99
00:05:50,872 --> 00:05:52,047
Wait, unless... can you?

100
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,876
Eliot, if you can save me,
you have to do it.

101
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:56,506
- The buzzards are coming soon...
- Wha...

102
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,967
- To peck out my eyes!
- My poor dead eyes!

103
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,490
- Okay, fine.
- Oh, God!

104
00:06:00,534 --> 00:06:02,100
Jesus, ch... chill.

105
00:06:02,144 --> 00:06:05,016
Oh, God!

106
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,670
Eliot!

107
00:06:23,078 --> 00:06:26,516
Which one of you beefy twats
built a magician-proof dungeon?

108
00:06:28,126 --> 00:06:30,912
All right,
let's brute-force this mother.

109
00:06:41,923 --> 00:06:43,403
Oh, my God.

110
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:49,496
"My friends,
if you're reading this,

111
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:51,846
"it's because I'm dead

112
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:54,588
"or I escaped and forgot
to get rid of this letter,

113
00:06:54,631 --> 00:06:55,893
"but probably the first one.

114
00:06:55,937 --> 00:06:57,895
"R-I-P me.

115
00:06:57,939 --> 00:06:59,264
"We knew something
had gone right on your end

116
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:01,856
"when magic came back
stronger than ever,

117
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:03,901
but then we didn't
hear from you."

118
00:07:03,945 --> 00:07:06,251
- News from the Northern Marsh.
- What about our friends?

119
00:07:06,295 --> 00:07:07,707
Have any of the messenger
bunnies returned?

120
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:08,993
Not as of yet.

121
00:07:09,037 --> 00:07:10,560
The rabbits believe
the connection

122
00:07:10,604 --> 00:07:13,258
between our world and yours
has been disturbed somehow.

123
00:07:13,302 --> 00:07:14,758
They're refusing
to come out of their burrows

124
00:07:14,782 --> 00:07:17,219
no matter how many cigarettes
we offer them.

125
00:07:17,262 --> 00:07:19,787
"Days turned into months
with no word from anyone

126
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,832
and no way
for us to return to Earth."

127
00:07:21,876 --> 00:07:23,747
Her languorousness Abigail

128
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,923
advises we send our armies
to the Northern Marsh

129
00:07:25,967 --> 00:07:27,838
to investigate the reports
of these creatures.

130
00:07:27,882 --> 00:07:30,841
The locals call them The Takers.

131
00:07:30,885 --> 00:07:33,278
Look, man, I may be drowning
my sorrows in fried chicken,

132
00:07:33,322 --> 00:07:34,279
but I'm not an idiot.

133
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:35,759
We're in over our heads.

134
00:07:35,803 --> 00:07:38,022
That's why we need to get
a message to Margo.

135
00:07:38,066 --> 00:07:40,590
"We spent so much time
trying to get you back

136
00:07:40,634 --> 00:07:41,698
"that we didn't see
the real problem

137
00:07:41,722 --> 00:07:43,158
"right in front of us.

138
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:45,116
The people rose up against us."

139
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,031
On the count of three,
we charge.

140
00:07:47,075 --> 00:07:48,618
- I don't have a weapon.
- You are the weapon!

141
00:07:48,642 --> 00:07:50,078
I'm just saying, you have two.

142
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:53,255
One, two, three, charge!

143
00:07:53,298 --> 00:07:55,126
"It did not go well for us."

144
00:07:58,565 --> 00:08:00,958
"Like a dope,
I had done some renovations

145
00:08:01,002 --> 00:08:03,091
"and made the dungeon
magician-proof.

146
00:08:03,134 --> 00:08:06,050
"Oops.

147
00:08:06,094 --> 00:08:09,793
"Margo, I hope it's you
who finds this...

148
00:08:09,837 --> 00:08:11,795
"And I hope you understand,

149
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:13,623
I did it all for you."

150
00:08:16,017 --> 00:08:17,627
"Good-bye."

151
00:08:22,153 --> 00:08:24,634
Did your pig visitor tell you
about the nature

152
00:08:24,678 --> 00:08:26,636
of this apocalyptic
whatever-the-hell

153
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,290
that's coming to kill us all?

154
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,858
No, but magicians
are blowing themselves up

155
00:08:30,901 --> 00:08:32,163
all over the place.

156
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:34,339
So many that civilians
have caught on.

157
00:08:34,383 --> 00:08:35,645
I think...

158
00:08:35,689 --> 00:08:36,840
There's too much goddamn magic.

159
00:08:36,864 --> 00:08:38,343
Yes, I know.

160
00:08:38,387 --> 00:08:41,346
Some surges come and go
and hardly anyone notices.

161
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,827
And sometimes it's a clusterfuck

162
00:08:43,871 --> 00:08:45,350
of catastrophe and death.

163
00:08:45,394 --> 00:08:46,830
I'm trying to find a pattern.

164
00:08:46,874 --> 00:08:48,702
Why some surges and not others.

165
00:08:48,745 --> 00:08:50,965
Well, if you'd had
a proper Brakebills education,

166
00:08:51,008 --> 00:08:52,008
you'd know the answer.

167
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:55,926
Circumstances, dear.

168
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,842
The phase of the moon,
the nearest body of water.

169
00:08:58,886 --> 00:09:00,888
You must factor them all
into your casting.

170
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:03,368
Even us filthy hedges
know about Circumstances.

171
00:09:03,412 --> 00:09:05,588
Trick is, certain Circumstances

172
00:09:05,632 --> 00:09:07,024
make casting easier.

173
00:09:07,068 --> 00:09:08,896
Others make them
much more difficult.

174
00:09:08,939 --> 00:09:10,724
Some of the surges
must be lining up

175
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:13,074
with particularly favorable
Circumstances.

176
00:09:13,117 --> 00:09:14,989
Is there any way to predict them

177
00:09:15,032 --> 00:09:17,382
so we can warn people
in advance?

178
00:09:17,426 --> 00:09:20,168
I may know someone
who can help you.

179
00:09:20,211 --> 00:09:21,648
Professor Ex.

180
00:09:21,691 --> 00:09:22,997
Wait, like the X-Men?

181
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,086
No, she's my ex-lover.

182
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:27,392
I like calling her that
because she hates it.

183
00:09:29,351 --> 00:09:32,006
She's a genius at metamath.

184
00:09:33,398 --> 00:09:36,053
- Do you feel that?
- Surge.

185
00:09:38,882 --> 00:09:40,884
Damn it.

186
00:09:40,928 --> 00:09:44,061
That was Professor Ex's
classroom blowing up.

187
00:09:44,105 --> 00:09:46,281
I picked a hell of a week
to quit drinking.

188
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:52,504
I asked around.

189
00:09:53,723 --> 00:09:55,179
Nobody knows who stole
the Book Depository.

190
00:09:55,203 --> 00:09:56,267
Did you ask David Copperfield?

191
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,640
Yeah.

192
00:09:57,684 --> 00:09:59,250
Oh.

193
00:09:59,294 --> 00:10:02,210
But a job this big,
somebody should have seen it.

194
00:10:02,253 --> 00:10:03,733
All right, look.

195
00:10:03,777 --> 00:10:05,343
My brain is fried, so...

196
00:10:05,387 --> 00:10:06,780
I either need to get some sleep

197
00:10:06,823 --> 00:10:10,261
or to fry it some more
recreationally.

198
00:10:10,305 --> 00:10:13,395
Well, club soda is as crazy
as I get these days, so...

199
00:10:13,438 --> 00:10:16,180
- Casual sex, then?
- Good-night, Pete.

200
00:10:20,445 --> 00:10:21,664
Good-night, boss.

201
00:10:25,581 --> 00:10:28,323
Your friend is like
if cocaine was a person.

202
00:10:28,366 --> 00:10:30,368
Well, it's a hedge bar.

203
00:10:30,412 --> 00:10:32,153
That description fits
half the people here.

204
00:10:32,196 --> 00:10:33,196
Not you.

205
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:36,418
What am I?

206
00:10:36,461 --> 00:10:39,595
A Mossad assassin
undercover as a lumberjack?

207
00:10:42,293 --> 00:10:44,600
And you play bass

208
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,168
in a J-pop hard metal
cover band?

209
00:10:47,211 --> 00:10:49,823
Close. K-pop.

210
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:50,866
Yu-jin.

211
00:10:52,608 --> 00:10:53,608
Kady.

212
00:11:05,752 --> 00:11:07,536
Oh, good morning.

213
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:08,929
Is it?

214
00:11:08,972 --> 00:11:10,887
Yeah, I know what you mean.

215
00:11:10,931 --> 00:11:13,237
Haven't had a night like that
in a while.

216
00:11:13,281 --> 00:11:15,239
I'll just, um... pants.

217
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:23,595
Uh, if you, uh...
wanna hang sometime or...

218
00:11:24,988 --> 00:11:26,642
You know,
I'm just gonna stop talking.

219
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,339
Yeah, I'll just, uh...

220
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,478
Um...

221
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:37,653
C-call me.

222
00:11:40,438 --> 00:11:42,310
Finally getting that GED?

223
00:11:42,353 --> 00:11:44,399
- Have some respect.
- I'm a professor.

224
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:48,272
Oh, "Chapter Seven:
Traveling Against Your Will."

225
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,840
That sounds like a problem.

226
00:11:50,884 --> 00:11:52,668
One of my students
was hearing this signal,

227
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,670
and when I listened to it,
I just traveled.

228
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,541
No idea where, no idea why,

229
00:11:56,585 --> 00:11:59,719
and none of this can explain it.

230
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:03,244
So just don't listen
to the signal again?

231
00:12:03,287 --> 00:12:05,942
- Wow, thank you.
- Shut up.

232
00:12:05,986 --> 00:12:08,466
Except now I hear it
all the time.

233
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:11,513
This here helps
quiet it down a bit, but...

234
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:13,645
It's kind of terrifying

235
00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:15,604
to lose control of yourself
like that.

236
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:16,823
Yeah.

237
00:12:16,866 --> 00:12:18,955
Are you okay?

238
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:21,784
You know,
hangover remedies are...

239
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:23,525
kind of a specialty of mine.

240
00:12:23,568 --> 00:12:25,745
I remember.

241
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:27,921
No judgment or anything,
but I thought...

242
00:12:27,964 --> 00:12:30,532
I'm sober.

243
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:31,881
Well, I was.

244
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:33,883
Almost a year, and here I am,

245
00:12:33,927 --> 00:12:37,887
and my head feels
like it's gonna explode.

246
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:40,760
And if I remembered deciding
to have that first drink...

247
00:12:42,022 --> 00:12:43,588
I would tell you why I did it.

248
00:12:43,632 --> 00:12:45,503
- You're human.
- Dust yourself off.

249
00:12:45,547 --> 00:12:47,679
Maybe keep searching for leads

250
00:12:47,723 --> 00:12:50,857
on that vanishing
Book Depository or whatever.

251
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,032
What?

252
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:53,773
That library branch
that got heisted.

253
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:55,905
You spent all day yesterday
looking for it.

254
00:12:57,951 --> 00:13:01,563
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

255
00:13:01,606 --> 00:13:03,006
Are you sure
you're just hungover?

256
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:09,876
Did you get my tacos?

257
00:13:12,095 --> 00:13:13,793
I got one
of everything they had.

258
00:13:17,492 --> 00:13:20,060
- Whose house is this?
- My mom's.

259
00:13:20,103 --> 00:13:21,539
Where is she?

260
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,846
She's at a sex... She's camping.

261
00:13:25,326 --> 00:13:27,415
This is a really long dream.

262
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:28,720
Mm-hmm.

263
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:33,595
- Hey.
- Oh, God.

264
00:13:33,638 --> 00:13:35,727
- What?
- Oh, hi.

265
00:13:35,771 --> 00:13:37,686
Um, look, I need help
with a metamath problem.

266
00:13:37,729 --> 00:13:39,949
The professor who specializes
in it at Brakebills

267
00:13:39,993 --> 00:13:42,778
blew herself up, so I figured,
uh, next best thing, right?

268
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:46,042
Yeah, you know, uh,
now's not a good time.

269
00:13:46,086 --> 00:13:48,871
My cousin's here from Canada
and, well, he's Canadian.

270
00:13:48,915 --> 00:13:50,830
So anyway, I got to go.

271
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:51,961
Alice.

272
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:55,965
That's...

273
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:58,446
that's Quentin.

274
00:13:58,489 --> 00:14:00,840
What the hell did you do?

275
00:14:18,596 --> 00:14:19,597
Hello.

276
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:23,471
Shit.

277
00:14:24,994 --> 00:14:26,822
So what do you say?

278
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,956
Wanna go back in time,
save my friends,

279
00:14:29,999 --> 00:14:32,001
and unfuck history
for old times' sake?

280
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:35,787
If I change anything,
it could undo every sacrifice

281
00:14:35,831 --> 00:14:37,615
we've all made
to stop The Beast.

282
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:40,923
Why did you build a workshop
full of time travel gadgets

283
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:42,577
if you aren't willing
to use them?

284
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,926
The lesson that I've learned

285
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,667
from a life of trying
to change the past

286
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:49,714
is, well, you almost always
make things worse.

287
00:14:50,715 --> 00:14:53,501
Speaking of, where is my little
volunteer tomato?

288
00:14:53,544 --> 00:14:54,981
Volunteer, um...

289
00:14:55,024 --> 00:14:56,547
Quentin, my dear.

290
00:14:58,854 --> 00:15:01,726
He died saving me.

291
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:03,685
Saving everybody.

292
00:15:06,731 --> 00:15:08,429
Stiff upper lip, eh?

293
00:15:08,472 --> 00:15:10,692
Positively British of you.

294
00:15:10,735 --> 00:15:12,172
Someone's got to
keep it together.

295
00:15:12,215 --> 00:15:13,825
Is that what you think
you're doing?

296
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:18,091
Back when Quentin
first came to Fillory

297
00:15:18,134 --> 00:15:20,180
in the very first timeline,

298
00:15:20,223 --> 00:15:22,530
he was running from grief.

299
00:15:22,573 --> 00:15:25,533
His best friend
had died tragically.

300
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:27,491
Julia.

301
00:15:27,535 --> 00:15:29,667
You.

302
00:15:29,711 --> 00:15:32,801
A victim of your own vices.

303
00:15:32,844 --> 00:15:36,457
I was worried that
I was taking advantage of him,

304
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,546
of his sorrow.

305
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:41,549
So the first change I made
was to save you

306
00:15:41,592 --> 00:15:44,465
to see if he would
still answer Fillory's call.

307
00:15:44,508 --> 00:15:46,467
And he did.

308
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,556
And then he died...

309
00:15:48,599 --> 00:15:50,819
39 times.

310
00:15:52,647 --> 00:15:54,997
I had hoped
this time would be different.

311
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,520
It still could be.

312
00:15:56,564 --> 00:15:59,045
You saved him 39 times.

313
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:00,133
Why not 40?

314
00:16:00,176 --> 00:16:02,048
Because he won.

315
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:04,006
If you took away his sacrifice,

316
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,008
you'd lose everything
that it bought you:

317
00:16:06,052 --> 00:16:09,142
Your life and the lives
of everyone around you.

318
00:16:09,185 --> 00:16:12,754
Same with your friends,
Josh and... was it Flen?

319
00:16:12,797 --> 00:16:15,104
It was not.

320
00:16:15,148 --> 00:16:18,020
You have to let go
of the past, Eliot.

321
00:16:18,064 --> 00:16:20,109
Let the dead stay dead.

322
00:16:28,813 --> 00:16:31,555
Time is a motherfucker,
isn't it?

323
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:35,124
Ah, tea is ready.

324
00:16:47,136 --> 00:16:49,530
Oh, shit.

325
00:17:04,545 --> 00:17:05,763
Why are you staring at me?

326
00:17:05,807 --> 00:17:08,592
Because...

327
00:17:08,636 --> 00:17:10,072
Holy shit.

328
00:17:10,116 --> 00:17:12,770
You look like somebody I know.

329
00:17:12,814 --> 00:17:15,469
My friend Julia...

330
00:17:15,512 --> 00:17:17,297
her grandma.

331
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,255
Yeah, okay, great.

332
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:21,475
Um, you know, I actually
have to talk to Alice,

333
00:17:21,518 --> 00:17:23,738
so maybe you could go
play with rocks or something.

334
00:17:29,265 --> 00:17:31,180
So you built a golem
out of living clay

335
00:17:31,224 --> 00:17:33,095
and used the book
of Quentin's life

336
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:35,402
to fill it with his memories?

337
00:17:35,445 --> 00:17:37,056
It's not so crazy.

338
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,555
And then you animated
the whole thing

339
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:40,189
with his essence?

340
00:17:40,233 --> 00:17:43,105
No, it's just a tiny grain
of Q's soul

341
00:17:43,149 --> 00:17:44,672
that I pulled
from the Underworld.

342
00:17:46,804 --> 00:17:48,217
You wouldn't help me
with a séance,

343
00:17:48,241 --> 00:17:49,546
and then you go and do this?

344
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,332
Well, I... I knew it was risky,
but it worked.

345
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,377
But it didn't.

346
00:17:54,421 --> 00:17:55,813
That is not the Quentin
you knew.

347
00:17:55,857 --> 00:17:58,468
That's... how could you
do something like this?

348
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:06,302
I found this in Q's stuff
at Brakebills.

349
00:18:09,349 --> 00:18:11,438
What is this?

350
00:18:11,481 --> 00:18:12,656
I don't know.

351
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,243
It's in a language
I've never seen before.

352
00:18:14,267 --> 00:18:16,486
It could be a... a letter
or a diary

353
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,141
or a project he was working on.

354
00:18:19,185 --> 00:18:21,361
I thought maybe
he left it for me to find.

355
00:18:21,404 --> 00:18:24,146
So you built the version of Q
that could read this for you.

356
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:25,539
Right, but...

357
00:18:25,582 --> 00:18:28,324
He's 12, so he can't.

358
00:18:28,368 --> 00:18:30,152
Get rid of it.

359
00:18:30,196 --> 00:18:31,825
Put back the piece
of Q's essence that you stole

360
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:33,329
and let him be at rest.

361
00:18:33,373 --> 00:18:36,419
It's not that simple.

362
00:18:36,463 --> 00:18:38,639
The spell keeps the golem alive

363
00:18:38,682 --> 00:18:42,686
until he completes the task
I brought him here to do.

364
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,471
So the spell
can never be finished

365
00:18:44,514 --> 00:18:47,474
'cause he can't read Q's letter.

366
00:18:47,517 --> 00:18:49,432
This was so insanely selfish.

367
00:18:51,521 --> 00:18:54,176
I can't sleep.

368
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,526
I can barely breathe.

369
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:59,660
I... I needed to fix something,

370
00:18:59,703 --> 00:19:00,791
finish something for him.

371
00:19:00,835 --> 00:19:02,489
Yeah, well, you fucked up.

372
00:19:02,532 --> 00:19:05,579
Maybe if we can figure out how,
we can fix it

373
00:19:05,622 --> 00:19:07,842
and you can put back
the piece of Quentin's soul

374
00:19:07,885 --> 00:19:09,757
where it belongs.

375
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:16,720
I'm glad you called.

376
00:19:16,764 --> 00:19:19,549
Last night was a bit of a blur.

377
00:19:19,593 --> 00:19:21,116
I was hoping
for a second chance.

378
00:19:23,423 --> 00:19:24,859
Kind of a blur for me too...

379
00:19:24,902 --> 00:19:26,730
- Mm.
- Which is why I called.

380
00:19:26,774 --> 00:19:28,906
See, I'm sober.

381
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:31,344
I don't remember drinking
last night,

382
00:19:31,387 --> 00:19:33,452
but I've got gaps in my memory,
and not just last night...

383
00:19:33,476 --> 00:19:35,280
I can't remember things
that happened days ago.

384
00:19:35,304 --> 00:19:37,219
What are you saying?

385
00:19:37,263 --> 00:19:40,222
I want to know
if you can explain.

386
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:42,442
Wait, you want to know
if I drugged you?

387
00:19:42,485 --> 00:19:43,747
I left you my number.

388
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,706
I... I showed up
for a second date,

389
00:19:45,749 --> 00:19:48,404
which is big for me, since I am
terrified of settling down.

390
00:19:48,448 --> 00:19:49,686
Oh, maybe I took a chance on you

391
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:51,233
because you remind me
of my cousin,

392
00:19:51,277 --> 00:19:53,409
who I've been obsessed with
since we were 13.

393
00:19:53,453 --> 00:19:55,672
Yes, my first cousin,
but our moms are twins.

394
00:19:55,716 --> 00:19:58,632
So genetically my half-sister,
which makes it worse.

395
00:19:58,675 --> 00:20:00,764
Why am I saying all this?

396
00:20:00,808 --> 00:20:02,201
Because I "truthied" your drink.

397
00:20:03,637 --> 00:20:05,856
You drugged me
to see if I drugged you?

398
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,946
You are insane.

399
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:10,272
But I swear,
whatever happened to you,

400
00:20:10,296 --> 00:20:11,645
I didn't do it.

401
00:20:11,688 --> 00:20:13,647
I... I mean,
I did some stuff to you.

402
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,257
O-on you. I mean, with you!

403
00:20:15,301 --> 00:20:16,432
Th-the sex stuff!

404
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:17,757
Because you asked,
for the record.

405
00:20:17,781 --> 00:20:19,305
God, fucking truth serums.

406
00:20:21,524 --> 00:20:23,613
Wait, wait. Kady, Kady.

407
00:20:23,657 --> 00:20:25,615
Um...

408
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:27,922
I got to my building
this morning,

409
00:20:27,965 --> 00:20:30,620
and I couldn't remember
which apartment was mine.

410
00:20:30,664 --> 00:20:34,276
I... I thought,
"Hey, crazy night."

411
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,888
But it seems like
if your memory was changed,

412
00:20:37,932 --> 00:20:39,934
so was mine.

413
00:20:39,977 --> 00:20:41,544
I need to know why.

414
00:20:51,989 --> 00:20:53,469
If the beheading
didn't kill Josh,

415
00:20:53,513 --> 00:20:54,949
the room service would have.

416
00:20:54,992 --> 00:20:56,646
I'll take your complaint
to the manager.

417
00:20:57,647 --> 00:20:59,519
Eliot?

418
00:20:59,562 --> 00:21:00,911
Just in time.

419
00:21:00,955 --> 00:21:02,478
The cell is Margo-proof,

420
00:21:02,522 --> 00:21:04,872
and when the Dark King gets
back from his summer palace,

421
00:21:04,915 --> 00:21:06,700
I'm gonna be executed.

422
00:21:06,743 --> 00:21:08,267
What's that?

423
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,312
The contents
of Jane Chatwin's garage,

424
00:21:10,356 --> 00:21:11,768
which we will use
to take back our kingdom.

425
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:13,576
My kingdom.

426
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,012
But sure.

427
00:21:15,056 --> 00:21:16,666
What is this?

428
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,320
"Permanence,"

429
00:21:18,364 --> 00:21:20,670
for men and women.

430
00:21:20,714 --> 00:21:23,325
Ugh, God, could you ask first?

431
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:27,677
Says this will protect us
from timey-wimey-whatever.

432
00:21:27,721 --> 00:21:28,896
So we can change the past

433
00:21:28,939 --> 00:21:30,352
and not erase ourselves
in the future.

434
00:21:30,376 --> 00:21:32,682
Clutch.

435
00:21:32,726 --> 00:21:34,641
- What's that?
- A smoker.

436
00:21:34,684 --> 00:21:37,774
Beekeepers use them
to calm down their hives.

437
00:21:37,818 --> 00:21:40,299
So that's super applicable
to our current situation.

438
00:21:43,563 --> 00:21:45,347
Wait.

439
00:21:45,391 --> 00:21:46,653
Josh would never shut up

440
00:21:46,696 --> 00:21:48,350
about the Royal Bees
of Whitespire.

441
00:21:48,394 --> 00:21:50,831
They make all the honey
for the castle's kitchens.

442
00:21:50,874 --> 00:21:52,963
And they're talking bees.

443
00:21:53,007 --> 00:21:55,923
Okay, all you have to do

444
00:21:55,966 --> 00:21:58,708
is get the bees to deliver
a message to Josh in the past

445
00:21:58,752 --> 00:22:00,319
and then smoke them out.

446
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:02,538
Huh, time bees.

447
00:22:11,112 --> 00:22:13,897
Hello, there, bees.

448
00:22:15,595 --> 00:22:17,336
Time bees activated.

449
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:19,816
I'm not sure it feels like
we changed the past.

450
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,601
At least, not yet.

451
00:22:21,644 --> 00:22:22,776
What are you doing?

452
00:22:22,819 --> 00:22:24,560
There used to be a letter
in here.

453
00:22:24,604 --> 00:22:25,605
Huh.

454
00:22:35,615 --> 00:22:36,659
It's Fen's.

455
00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:41,490
High King Fen here
giving you an update

456
00:22:41,534 --> 00:22:43,623
on life in Castle Whitespire.

457
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:45,755
Babadook hats
and open-toed shoes

458
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:47,583
are the style this season.

459
00:22:47,627 --> 00:22:48,976
Ooh, hey, Josh.

460
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:51,065
- Hey, get in my Insta story.
- Uh, no.

461
00:22:51,108 --> 00:22:53,676
There is no Insta
on Fillory, Fen...

462
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,504
- But...
- So this is...

463
00:22:55,548 --> 00:22:57,593
- I have three bars.
- We're on a different planet.

464
00:22:57,637 --> 00:23:00,857
That's not even po...
How do you have three bars?

465
00:23:00,901 --> 00:23:02,946
This is... what phone is this?

466
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,707
- The time bees.
- Oh, God, do you hear that?

467
00:23:04,731 --> 00:23:06,472
Well played, sister.

468
00:23:06,515 --> 00:23:07,715
Oh, they're saying something.

469
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:08,430
Fen, I'm allergic to bees!

470
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,040
Or maybe not.

471
00:23:10,998 --> 00:23:12,078
- Oh, God!
- Please help me!

472
00:23:13,304 --> 00:23:14,630
- Oh, God! Oh, God!
- I'm being killed...

473
00:23:14,654 --> 00:23:16,917
by so many bees!

474
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,136
Did Josh say he was allergic?

475
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,138
Right.

476
00:23:21,182 --> 00:23:23,880
That's why Josh would
never shut up about the bees.

477
00:23:25,491 --> 00:23:26,666
Oops.

478
00:23:43,073 --> 00:23:44,988
I had a friend
who used to do that.

479
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:51,299
Once he got to the end
of his favorite book,

480
00:23:51,342 --> 00:23:53,127
he'd go back
to the beginning again.

481
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,303
Endings are the worst part.

482
00:23:55,346 --> 00:23:58,611
Characters grow up,
they move on.

483
00:23:58,654 --> 00:24:00,134
Some of them die.

484
00:24:00,177 --> 00:24:01,222
It feels like...

485
00:24:01,265 --> 00:24:02,504
Your best friend
in the whole world's

486
00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:04,181
abandoned you.

487
00:24:06,096 --> 00:24:07,533
I've had this
conversation before.

488
00:24:07,576 --> 00:24:08,969
So have I.

489
00:24:09,012 --> 00:24:10,492
The therapist my mom sends me to

490
00:24:10,536 --> 00:24:13,321
says I have transition anxiety.

491
00:24:13,364 --> 00:24:16,019
As if it's too much to ask
that nothing ever change.

492
00:24:16,063 --> 00:24:18,979
Well, your real friends
won't abandon you.

493
00:24:19,022 --> 00:24:21,416
That will never change.

494
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,940
My best friend will start
dating skeevy guys

495
00:24:23,984 --> 00:24:25,507
who smoke and spit,

496
00:24:25,551 --> 00:24:29,337
and she'll forget
I ever existed.

497
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,470
You're just gonna
have to trust me on this one,

498
00:24:31,513 --> 00:24:34,168
but the "skeevy guys" thing?

499
00:24:34,211 --> 00:24:36,213
It's just a phase.

500
00:24:36,257 --> 00:24:38,520
She needs you just as much
as you need her.

501
00:24:44,004 --> 00:24:45,048
Um, excuse me.

502
00:24:49,357 --> 00:24:51,968
I tried to find a flaw
in the casting,

503
00:24:52,012 --> 00:24:53,535
but I couldn't.

504
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:56,016
That's him.

505
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:57,408
It's Q.

506
00:24:57,452 --> 00:25:00,194
The one I knew at that age.

507
00:25:00,237 --> 00:25:02,370
But the spell...

508
00:25:02,413 --> 00:25:05,460
I've been doing a lot
of reading on Circumstances.

509
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,375
Not all of them
are astrological.

510
00:25:07,418 --> 00:25:09,508
- Some of them...
- Are inside you.

511
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,513
I think you did
that spell perfectly.

512
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:16,645
Your brain might have asked
for the version of Q

513
00:25:16,689 --> 00:25:19,387
that could his letter, but...

514
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:23,347
your internal Circumstances
asked for something different.

515
00:25:23,391 --> 00:25:25,611
Maybe you need to ask him
a different question.

516
00:25:36,622 --> 00:25:38,145
What's that?

517
00:25:38,188 --> 00:25:40,582
"A History of Fillory,"
from the Royal Library.

518
00:25:40,626 --> 00:25:42,323
What does it say?

519
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:49,722
"After the Fresh Prince
was stung to death

520
00:25:49,765 --> 00:25:53,290
"by a swarm
of honey-drunk assassins,

521
00:25:53,334 --> 00:25:54,683
High King Fen... ".

522
00:25:54,727 --> 00:25:57,730
My God, she listened
to the bees.

523
00:25:57,773 --> 00:26:01,037
"She sent an army of soldiers
to hunt down the Dark King,

524
00:26:01,081 --> 00:26:03,344
"a massive manhunt
that was viewed

525
00:26:03,387 --> 00:26:06,129
"as tyrannical overreach
by the people of Fillory.

526
00:26:06,173 --> 00:26:09,393
She was overthrown
and executed."

527
00:26:09,437 --> 00:26:12,440
The Takers invaded,
the Dark King still rose.

528
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:16,705
So...

529
00:26:16,749 --> 00:26:18,141
that's it, then?

530
00:26:19,142 --> 00:26:23,364
I-in what conceivable
universe is that it?

531
00:26:23,407 --> 00:26:25,627
I'm just saying,
we're doing all of this

532
00:26:25,671 --> 00:26:28,238
to save a man
you ostensibly love

533
00:26:28,282 --> 00:26:31,677
who died of a bee sting because
you forgot he was allergic.

534
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,331
What is your fucking point?

535
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:36,769
I was gone, you were alone...
And you hate being alone...

536
00:26:36,812 --> 00:26:39,293
And so you grabbed the first
dick that crossed your desk,

537
00:26:39,336 --> 00:26:41,295
and you're having a hard time
letting go.

538
00:26:41,338 --> 00:26:44,254
You think I should let go
of our friends' lives?

539
00:26:44,298 --> 00:26:47,606
I think you have a textbook case

540
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:49,651
of cock blindness.

541
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:51,392
You are Margo the Destroyer,

542
00:26:51,435 --> 00:26:53,699
not Margo the Pining Girlfriend.

543
00:26:56,397 --> 00:26:58,268
I'm gonna let
your bullshit slide

544
00:26:58,312 --> 00:27:00,183
on account of you
so recently being possessed

545
00:27:00,227 --> 00:27:02,185
by a homicidal monster...

546
00:27:03,796 --> 00:27:06,320
But I'm not changing my plan.

547
00:27:06,363 --> 00:27:07,713
Okay. Okay.

548
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:10,672
Go for it.

549
00:27:19,072 --> 00:27:20,203
Wait.

550
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,208
I recognize these.

551
00:27:31,388 --> 00:27:33,477
The first time Jane
came to Fillory by herself,

552
00:27:33,521 --> 00:27:35,784
she was homesick
and missed her brothers.

553
00:27:35,828 --> 00:27:38,265
A forest crone
gave her these stamps.

554
00:27:38,308 --> 00:27:40,615
Put them on a letter,
address it whoever,

555
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,139
wherever, whenever,
and it gets to them.

556
00:27:43,183 --> 00:27:44,532
This could be our chance.

557
00:27:44,575 --> 00:27:47,056
I can just tell Josh
how to fix things.

558
00:27:49,145 --> 00:27:50,669
Find an envelope!

559
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:53,628
Address it to "Josh Hoberman,
Castle Whitespire",

560
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,412
before he was killed by bees."

561
00:27:59,373 --> 00:28:01,462
"Dear Josh,
hello from your friends

562
00:28:01,505 --> 00:28:03,072
"300 years in the future.

563
00:28:04,334 --> 00:28:06,214
"The bad news is,
we can't come back to get you.

564
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:08,227
"The good news:
If you do exactly what I say,

565
00:28:08,382 --> 00:28:09,838
you won't be overthrown
and executed."

566
00:28:09,862 --> 00:28:11,462
Uh, Fen, you're
gonna want to see this!

567
00:28:11,951 --> 00:28:13,391
"Those reports
you've been ignoring

568
00:28:13,517 --> 00:28:13,692
"about an invasion of creatures

569
00:28:14,475 --> 00:28:15,475
"in the Northern Marsh?

570
00:28:16,651 --> 00:28:18,479
Stop ignoring them.
Send an army, today."

571
00:28:18,522 --> 00:28:20,655
- I told you we should have.
- Just shush!

572
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,875
Summon the guards!

573
00:28:22,918 --> 00:28:25,181
Everyone, we did it!

574
00:28:25,225 --> 00:28:26,617
We scared The Takers back

575
00:28:26,661 --> 00:28:28,141
to wherever
the hell they came from.

576
00:28:28,184 --> 00:28:29,490
Go us!

577
00:28:29,533 --> 00:28:31,622
"And somehow,
when we fix the past..."

578
00:28:33,276 --> 00:28:35,844
"I hope we can
see each other again.

579
00:28:35,888 --> 00:28:37,237
Love, Margo."

580
00:28:43,504 --> 00:28:44,592
The letter disappeared

581
00:28:44,635 --> 00:28:45,915
the moment I closed the mailbox.

582
00:28:45,941 --> 00:28:46,941
It worked.

583
00:28:48,814 --> 00:28:50,816
Josh and Fen
did a banishment spell

584
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:53,819
to scare off The Takers...
they thought.

585
00:28:53,862 --> 00:28:56,430
Then the creatures came back
and killed Josh and Fen

586
00:28:56,473 --> 00:28:57,736
and everyone in Whitespire.

587
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:02,349
Don't say anything.

588
00:29:12,402 --> 00:29:14,274
Okay, it's working.

589
00:29:14,317 --> 00:29:17,668
So how does a homemade
psychic amplifier help

590
00:29:17,712 --> 00:29:19,192
if I'm not a psychic?

591
00:29:19,235 --> 00:29:20,584
Lowers the bar just enough

592
00:29:20,628 --> 00:29:22,258
for the two of you to be able
to connect your minds.

593
00:29:22,282 --> 00:29:23,805
We're both missing memories.

594
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:25,198
If we combine the ones we have,

595
00:29:25,241 --> 00:29:26,349
it might be enough
to give us an answer.

596
00:29:26,373 --> 00:29:29,289
Huh, so it's like,
uh, memory VR.

597
00:29:29,332 --> 00:29:31,770
- No.
- So you're sure about this?

598
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:35,208
I'm sure I need to know
what happened to me.

599
00:29:35,251 --> 00:29:36,818
You?

600
00:29:36,862 --> 00:29:38,515
- Same.
- Don't touch.

601
00:29:41,257 --> 00:29:43,825
Hands together, please.

602
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:51,746
So where should we start?

603
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,314
Last night, the bar.

604
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,848
Your friend is like
if cocaine was a person.

605
00:30:06,892 --> 00:30:08,850
Well, it's a hedge bar.

606
00:30:08,894 --> 00:30:10,852
That description fits
half the people here.

607
00:30:10,896 --> 00:30:12,767
Not you.

608
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:16,423
Oh, come on,
this is totally memory VR.

609
00:30:16,466 --> 00:30:18,555
Shh.

610
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:19,861
All right, now what?

611
00:30:19,905 --> 00:30:22,298
A Mossad assassin
undercover as...

612
00:30:22,342 --> 00:30:24,866
Now we watch.

613
00:30:26,737 --> 00:30:29,305
And you...

614
00:30:29,349 --> 00:30:31,873
play bass in a J-pop
hard metal cover band?

615
00:30:38,488 --> 00:30:39,707
I could look away.

616
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,840
You clearly already remember it.

617
00:30:48,411 --> 00:30:49,456
I don't know.

618
00:30:49,499 --> 00:30:51,501
No drugs slipped
into our drinks,

619
00:30:51,545 --> 00:30:54,330
no head injuries.

620
00:30:54,374 --> 00:30:56,767
Whatever happened to us,
it seems like we both forgot.

621
00:31:19,442 --> 00:31:21,053
Whoa, what the hell?

622
00:31:24,491 --> 00:31:25,884
Stop! What are you doing?

623
00:31:34,283 --> 00:31:37,286
Kady, I... I know
that looked bad.

624
00:31:38,157 --> 00:31:39,245
What the hell was that?

625
00:31:39,288 --> 00:31:40,568
What, some kind of memory spell?

626
00:31:40,594 --> 00:31:41,963
I mean, it looked like it,
but I don't know.

627
00:31:41,987 --> 00:31:43,336
I don't remember.

628
00:31:43,379 --> 00:31:45,468
Well, what the hell
do you remember, then?

629
00:31:45,512 --> 00:31:47,906
- Why were you at the bar?
- To drink.

630
00:31:47,949 --> 00:31:50,038
T-to...

631
00:31:50,082 --> 00:31:51,822
to meet a friend.

632
00:31:51,866 --> 00:31:53,041
Who?

633
00:31:53,085 --> 00:31:55,217
A... a hedge I know
from my first safe house.

634
00:31:55,261 --> 00:31:56,262
Show me.

635
00:32:01,006 --> 00:32:03,138
That's my friend. She's...

636
00:32:03,182 --> 00:32:04,574
The woman that Pete left with.

637
00:32:11,407 --> 00:32:12,931
What are you?

638
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:14,584
What, some kind
of Manchurian Candidate?

639
00:32:14,628 --> 00:32:16,412
A sleeper agent
that gets activated

640
00:32:16,456 --> 00:32:18,327
to attack women
in their bedrooms?

641
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:20,416
This doesn't make any sense.

642
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,983
What's on the card?

643
00:32:27,423 --> 00:32:30,165
I-I can't make it out.

644
00:32:30,209 --> 00:32:31,209
Damn it.

645
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:34,102
I know what's on the card.

646
00:32:34,126 --> 00:32:36,041
How?

647
00:32:36,084 --> 00:32:37,366
You put your
phone number on it...

648
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,608
Whoa, K-Kady, wait...

649
00:32:38,652 --> 00:32:41,089
So show me who you really are.

650
00:33:03,459 --> 00:33:06,114
Someone sent you
to erase my memory.

651
00:33:06,158 --> 00:33:08,334
- Who?
- I have no idea.

652
00:33:08,377 --> 00:33:09,639
I never do.

653
00:33:09,683 --> 00:33:11,424
I get a job, I do it,

654
00:33:11,467 --> 00:33:13,339
and when it's over,

655
00:33:13,382 --> 00:33:15,341
I make sure I don't remember.

656
00:33:15,384 --> 00:33:17,038
You walk around having no idea

657
00:33:17,082 --> 00:33:18,387
what you do for a living?

658
00:33:18,431 --> 00:33:20,389
Why would I want that
on my conscience?

659
00:33:20,433 --> 00:33:23,131
Because that's
what a conscience is for,

660
00:33:23,175 --> 00:33:25,394
to keep you from doing
fucked up shit.

661
00:33:25,438 --> 00:33:28,093
- The world is painful.
- That's not gonna change.

662
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:32,053
So I use whatever crutch
I have to

663
00:33:32,097 --> 00:33:33,663
to keep going.

664
00:33:33,707 --> 00:33:35,404
The point is,

665
00:33:35,448 --> 00:33:37,189
you can take the shiv
from my throat,

666
00:33:37,232 --> 00:33:40,322
because I can't rat out someone
I don't remember.

667
00:33:40,366 --> 00:33:42,498
Well, my friend's a psychic.

668
00:33:42,542 --> 00:33:44,109
Why don't I have him root around

669
00:33:44,152 --> 00:33:46,198
and see what you do
and don't remember?

670
00:33:48,156 --> 00:33:50,680
Then you don't leave me
much choice, Kady.

671
00:33:50,724 --> 00:33:53,031
Mortem.

672
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:55,250
No, no! Damn it!

673
00:33:55,294 --> 00:33:57,165
Who sent... who sent you?

674
00:33:57,209 --> 00:33:59,037
Who...

675
00:34:09,438 --> 00:34:10,438
What the hell happened?

676
00:34:11,484 --> 00:34:13,486
- I don't know.
- He just... self-destructed.

677
00:34:16,358 --> 00:34:18,012
He's gone.

678
00:34:22,147 --> 00:34:24,366
Telling them to kill
the Dark King was a bust.

679
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:26,238
Same with going after
The Takers.

680
00:34:28,153 --> 00:34:30,198
We need a new plan.
We only have two stamps left.

681
00:34:30,242 --> 00:34:31,678
One stamp.

682
00:34:31,721 --> 00:34:34,115
After your last letter to Josh,
I had an idea.

683
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,638
I gave it a shot.

684
00:34:35,682 --> 00:34:37,988
It didn't work, so...

685
00:34:38,032 --> 00:34:39,599
one stamp.

686
00:34:39,642 --> 00:34:41,209
And you didn't tell me?

687
00:34:41,253 --> 00:34:42,689
I'm not your subject.

688
00:34:42,732 --> 00:34:45,083
- I'm your friend.
- Fine.

689
00:34:45,126 --> 00:34:47,389
Then what would you tell Josh
to do?

690
00:34:47,433 --> 00:34:50,044
Run to the nearest dive
and drink himself to death?

691
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,743
Yes.

692
00:34:53,787 --> 00:34:55,745
I would run away,

693
00:34:55,789 --> 00:34:58,008
because you try
to save your friends

694
00:34:58,052 --> 00:34:59,749
and they die anyway.

695
00:34:59,793 --> 00:35:01,577
You can't stop The Takers,

696
00:35:01,621 --> 00:35:03,579
and you can't stop
the Dark King.

697
00:35:03,623 --> 00:35:05,233
And if we don't focus
on getting you out,

698
00:35:05,277 --> 00:35:07,583
you're gonna get decapitated.

699
00:35:07,627 --> 00:35:09,716
Fillory is fucked
because it always is,

700
00:35:09,759 --> 00:35:11,607
and I don't get why you keep
trying to fix something

701
00:35:11,631 --> 00:35:13,111
that wants to be broken.

702
00:35:13,154 --> 00:35:16,636
It may be broken,
but it's my home.

703
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:18,725
It hasn't been your home
for 300 years.

704
00:35:21,467 --> 00:35:22,618
You are right about one thing.

705
00:35:22,642 --> 00:35:25,384
I have gone soft.

706
00:35:25,427 --> 00:35:26,689
I've been telling myself

707
00:35:26,733 --> 00:35:28,778
that if I can just keep Josh
from dying,

708
00:35:28,822 --> 00:35:31,303
somehow I can get him
and my kingdom back.

709
00:35:31,346 --> 00:35:34,393
But that's not possible, is it?

710
00:35:39,702 --> 00:35:41,139
What are you telling him?

711
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,797
I told him
he needs to stay here.

712
00:35:47,841 --> 00:35:50,104
He can use the information
from this history book

713
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,588
to fight the Dark King
and The Takers

714
00:35:51,627 --> 00:35:54,500
wherever they show up
for the rest of his life.

715
00:35:57,633 --> 00:35:59,244
I told him good-bye.

716
00:36:14,215 --> 00:36:17,523
I'm not dreaming, am I?

717
00:36:19,655 --> 00:36:21,788
I ask because it's been,
like, a full day,

718
00:36:21,831 --> 00:36:24,530
and if you sleep for that long,
it's 'cause you're dead.

719
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,581
I had this friend...

720
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:35,062
who I loved very much...

721
00:36:36,672 --> 00:36:38,631
And he died,

722
00:36:38,674 --> 00:36:40,807
and I didn't get
to say good-bye.

723
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,724
And I honestly don't know

724
00:36:44,767 --> 00:36:47,553
how I'm gonna go on without him.

725
00:36:47,596 --> 00:36:50,120
And he gave me this gift
I can never repay.

726
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,126
What was the gift?

727
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:57,911
His life.

728
00:37:00,043 --> 00:37:02,220
He gave it up for mine.

729
00:37:05,048 --> 00:37:08,313
I brought you here
'cause I wanted closure.

730
00:37:08,356 --> 00:37:11,272
You know, I just...
I wanted to...

731
00:37:11,316 --> 00:37:15,058
fix something
or finish something for him.

732
00:37:15,102 --> 00:37:18,018
But the letter I showed you,

733
00:37:18,061 --> 00:37:20,150
you couldn't read it, so...

734
00:37:21,151 --> 00:37:23,676
You're skipping
to the beginning of the book.

735
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:25,330
What?

736
00:37:25,373 --> 00:37:27,854
I can't help you

737
00:37:27,897 --> 00:37:30,335
because you don't want me to.

738
00:37:30,378 --> 00:37:33,120
Because then your friend's
story is over.

739
00:37:39,169 --> 00:37:41,998
My dad says
when I get sad about something

740
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:43,696
that's gonna end...

741
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:47,874
I should just imagine
this is the first page

742
00:37:47,917 --> 00:37:49,049
in a new book.

743
00:37:53,749 --> 00:37:55,360
The gift your friend gave you...

744
00:37:57,362 --> 00:38:00,016
It wasn't his life.

745
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,236
It was yours.

746
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,064
That story just started.

747
00:38:05,892 --> 00:38:08,329
What?

748
00:38:08,373 --> 00:38:11,201
I just shouldn't be surprised
that, even at age 12,

749
00:38:11,245 --> 00:38:14,596
Quentin Coldwater is still
the smartest person I know.

750
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:24,780
I'm feeling tired.

751
00:38:26,652 --> 00:38:28,131
Really tired.

752
00:38:31,178 --> 00:38:33,920
Hey, do you want to see a trick?

753
00:38:35,051 --> 00:38:36,051
Sure.

754
00:38:55,289 --> 00:38:56,986
- That was cool.
- Yeah.

755
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:10,957
There's just one more thing
I wanted to say.

756
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I...

757
00:39:16,441 --> 00:39:18,356
Good-bye, Quentin.

758
00:39:28,191 --> 00:39:30,716
He's gone.

759
00:39:30,759 --> 00:39:31,847
You okay?

760
00:39:36,156 --> 00:39:37,418
I'm sorry he couldn't give you

761
00:39:37,462 --> 00:39:39,072
the answer you wanted.

762
00:39:41,901 --> 00:39:44,860
No, he did.

763
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,347
Maybe I can still help you
with your problem.

764
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,009
My dad had a friend with a...

765
00:40:03,052 --> 00:40:05,403
really rare discipline,

766
00:40:05,446 --> 00:40:07,840
predicting Circumstances.

767
00:40:07,883 --> 00:40:09,189
They lost touch years ago,

768
00:40:09,232 --> 00:40:11,800
but she wrote this.

769
00:40:15,804 --> 00:40:18,285
If anyone can find the pattern
you're looking for,

770
00:40:18,328 --> 00:40:20,026
it'll be her.

771
00:40:21,506 --> 00:40:22,898
Thanks.

772
00:40:23,986 --> 00:40:25,379
I don't remember any of it.

773
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,382
The Book Depository,

774
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:31,385
the mystery woman
who apparently wiped my memory.

775
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,082
All I know
is what you told me, which...

776
00:40:33,126 --> 00:40:35,998
Isn't enough
to do anything with.

777
00:40:36,042 --> 00:40:37,323
Somebody's out there
with enough power

778
00:40:37,347 --> 00:40:39,872
to steal a building,
paranoid enough to send

779
00:40:39,915 --> 00:40:42,918
mind-wiping sleeper agent
assassins after you...

780
00:40:42,962 --> 00:40:44,877
It's not nothing.

781
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:47,880
Well, I need a drink.

782
00:40:47,923 --> 00:40:49,882
Sorry. Insensitive.

783
00:40:51,057 --> 00:40:52,972
I'll show myself out.

784
00:40:58,586 --> 00:41:00,849
How are you feeling?

785
00:41:02,982 --> 00:41:06,159
You know, I thought that
if I took on more power

786
00:41:06,202 --> 00:41:09,249
and more responsibility...

787
00:41:09,292 --> 00:41:11,425
that I'd want heroin less.

788
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,036
But the truth is,

789
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,908
when I thought I'd relapsed,

790
00:41:15,951 --> 00:41:18,388
I wasn't disappointed.

791
00:41:18,432 --> 00:41:21,000
Wasn't mad at myself.

792
00:41:21,043 --> 00:41:22,958
I was relieved.

793
00:41:25,308 --> 00:41:27,528
It gave me permission
to relapse some more.

794
00:41:28,964 --> 00:41:31,053
And trying to lead the hedges,

795
00:41:31,097 --> 00:41:32,925
it's only gonna get harder.

796
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:38,104
And I'm not sure I can do it
without a crutch.

797
00:41:42,151 --> 00:41:44,240
Which maybe means
I shouldn't do it at all.

798
00:41:49,985 --> 00:41:51,813
No, don't.

799
00:42:03,085 --> 00:42:04,913
You never quite
get used to the smell

800
00:42:04,957 --> 00:42:07,133
of Fillorian plumbing, do you?

801
00:42:07,176 --> 00:42:08,482
Josh...

802
00:42:10,179 --> 00:42:11,572
You're alive.

803
00:42:11,616 --> 00:42:13,182
Thanks to you.

804
00:42:13,226 --> 00:42:15,358
I got your letter.

805
00:42:15,402 --> 00:42:17,404
Right.

806
00:42:17,447 --> 00:42:19,362
- The letter.
- Did exactly what you said.

807
00:42:19,406 --> 00:42:21,582
I went to the Clock Dwarf,
brought him a ham sandwich,

808
00:42:21,626 --> 00:42:24,542
and told him to send me forward
300 years.

809
00:42:25,412 --> 00:42:28,197
- Just you?
- No, Fen came too.

810
00:42:28,241 --> 00:42:29,982
And Tick, and Rafe,

811
00:42:30,025 --> 00:42:31,592
and a few guys
from my bowling league...

812
00:42:31,636 --> 00:42:33,202
I started a bowling league...

813
00:42:33,246 --> 00:42:35,553
And a dozen other people.

814
00:42:35,596 --> 00:42:37,119
Nobody cool wanted
to stay in the past

815
00:42:37,163 --> 00:42:40,035
once they knew what was coming.

816
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:41,994
I can't believe it.

817
00:42:42,037 --> 00:42:43,952
Look behind the stone.

818
00:42:51,656 --> 00:42:54,049
I hid it there before I left.

819
00:42:59,925 --> 00:43:02,449
Margo, thank you.

820
00:43:07,019 --> 00:43:09,021
May I present the government

821
00:43:09,064 --> 00:43:11,893
of High King Margo in exile.

822
00:43:18,683 --> 00:43:20,685
Let's get out of here
before we all get killed.
