1
00:00:01,268 --> 00:00:02,861
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:04,371 --> 00:00:06,340
<i>You didn't just
save their lives.</i>

3
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:11,644
<i>You changed their lives as
much as they changed yours.</i>

4
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:13,833
You didn't want
to leave all that.

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:23,518
Pardon me, sir. Fillory is still
ruled by Acting High King Fen, right?

6
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:25,525
The Dark King reigns.
Glory to his rule.

7
00:00:25,592 --> 00:00:27,561
High King Fen and
Josh the Fresh Prince

8
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:29,289
were overthrown 300 years ago.

9
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,289
We need you to go find someone,

10
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:33,990
and do your very best to
convince them to come and help us.

11
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:36,202
Alice Quinn.

12
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:39,132
Get a blood worm
and cast, you boil alive.

13
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:42,734
<i>Reed's Mark would prevent
them from triggering the parasite.</i>

14
00:00:42,843 --> 00:00:46,041
<i>Then once this Serpent
group have been dealt with,</i>

15
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:47,774
the mark is removed
free of charge.

16
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:50,550
The one that I'm the
most worried about is Julia.

17
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:53,416
Thank you for deciding that
I'll never get to do magic again.

18
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,247
<i>She's been in a weird place.</i>

19
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:56,355
<i>And magic...</i>

20
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:58,348
Comes from pain.

21
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,595
Did you... Did
you just see that?

22
00:01:03,964 --> 00:01:04,964
Yeah.

23
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:07,361
So, what are you
going to do with it?

24
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,443
Okay.

25
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:36,888
<i>I had a dream, I had a dream</i>

26
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:38,899
<i>That I was your neighbor</i>

27
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:42,628
<i>About to give birth and then...</i>

28
00:01:42,736 --> 00:01:44,227
Julia, you, uh, ready?

29
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:47,165
Wow. Wow,

30
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,004
you look... Overdressed?

31
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,109
Great.

32
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:57,174
I thought you said
this was a date.

33
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:59,548
I said I was taking you out,
and to dress appropriately.

34
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,620
That means dress up.

35
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,246
You totally told me to dress up.

36
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,484
I should have been
more specific. Good.

37
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:06,988
Glad to hear you
accept the blame.

38
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,172
Only problem is we gotta
go now or we're gonna miss it.

39
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:10,196
Where's your coat?

40
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:13,930
But it's 75 degrees out.
Not where we're going.

41
00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:20,134
Okay.

42
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:22,308
Here.

43
00:02:23,944 --> 00:02:25,435
Do you consent to be traveled?

44
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,671
I consent to be...

45
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,819
Traveled. Where are we?

46
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,587
Other side of the planet. Look.

47
00:02:37,424 --> 00:02:38,949
So, my friend Seth is an artist,

48
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:40,756
but there hasn't
been enough magic

49
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,661
for him to work with
meteors until now.

50
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:47,967
It's incredible.

51
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:09,481
See, there are a lot of ways to use
magic to make the world a better place.

52
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,059
Wait. What?

53
00:03:18,632 --> 00:03:19,998
Is that why you brought me here?

54
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,202
No, that's not really the...

55
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:25,014
I mean, you've been working
so hard to try to figure this out.

56
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,233
I told you, it's my business.

57
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:30,039
And I'm just trying to help.
You know, to brainstorm.

58
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:31,736
I need to choose that.

59
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,078
You understand what
that means, right?

60
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:38,884
You feel that?

61
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,920
It's another surge.

62
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:50,096
Shit.

63
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:51,564
Uh, Penny...

64
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:05,868
How does making pretty patterns

65
00:04:05,946 --> 00:04:08,677
in the sky help the world when
this type of a thing can happen?

66
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:11,116
No one knows when a
magic surge is coming.

67
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:14,283
So, what? We shouldn't
try and make things nicer?

68
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:15,582
The surges are getting worse.

69
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:17,033
I'm just saying, this
is the type of thing

70
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,525
I should be using
my magic to fix.

71
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,892
Julia, I... I just wanted you
to have a break for one night.

72
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:24,090
Yeah, but this is
why I'm working.

73
00:04:24,698 --> 00:04:26,326
I'm...

74
00:04:26,433 --> 00:04:29,130
I only have magic
because I lost Q.

75
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:33,066
I... I just have to find
something to do with it that...

76
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:36,633
That's worth that.

77
00:04:36,877 --> 00:04:41,042
Julia, there's nothing that you will
ever be able to do that's worth losing him.

78
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:50,321
You know what kills me?

79
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,123
I just keep thinking, like,

80
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:55,526
oh, I should talk to Q.

81
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,163
He'd know what I should do.

82
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,897
And then I think, "Oh, right."

83
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,776
It's only been a month.

84
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:10,310
This kind of thing
takes a while.

85
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:19,987
Ugh. God damn it. Shit.

86
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:22,388
My apologies. Dean Fogg?

87
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:25,482
I was waiting for the
right moment to interject.

88
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:28,192
And, well, that never came.

89
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:32,194
Are you drunk? No. And
I'm sorry about the scotch.

90
00:05:32,465 --> 00:05:34,798
I was, um, smelling it.

91
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:40,470
You're not trying to get me to
go to Brakebills again, are you?

92
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,174
Hardly, dear.

93
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:46,343
I accepted your refusal,
as any gentleman should.

94
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:49,113
Truth is, I'm actually
here for Penny.

95
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:54,764
Jesus Christ. What
happened here?

96
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:56,780
Everett drank a
reservoir of magic

97
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,189
and exploded.

98
00:05:58,725 --> 00:05:59,988
It had to go somewhere.

99
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:02,958
Too much magic means
too many people with potential

100
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,395
are discovering their gift.

101
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:07,399
Lately, more people have been
able to pass than we can handle.

102
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,059
And now look at this place.

103
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:11,729
Might as well be a
goddamn state school.

104
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:14,664
Overcrowded.
Discipline problems.

105
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,140
Did you know someone stole
the school's supply of living clay?

106
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:19,889
No. Of course,
thanks to the surges,

107
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:21,575
a few of them have
blown themselves up.

108
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:23,226
Which isn't very
good for morale,

109
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,584
but yes, it helps with the
goddamn over-enrollment.

110
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:30,020
With the rise in students
has come a simultaneous rise

111
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,286
in some of the
rarer disciplines.

112
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,392
Like yours.

113
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:40,390
So, who better to
teach them than you?

114
00:06:41,868 --> 00:06:44,269
Whoa, I'm no professor.

115
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:46,897
Penny, you're the only
Brakebills-educated Traveler

116
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:48,373
currently alive on this planet.

117
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:52,173
Which makes you far more qualified
to teach them than anyone else I have.

118
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,245
Including me.

119
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:55,305
But what if one of them
gets killed because of me?

120
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,415
Excellent point.

121
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:01,244
This indemnifies you against
any claims, legal or magical,

122
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:02,465
that your students might make.

123
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,082
That doesn't actually
solve my problem.

124
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:08,187
Penny, I can assure you
that without your instruction,

125
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:10,487
one of them will
absolutely get killed.

126
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
Fine.

127
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,841
To our pretty corpses.

128
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:33,147
Goddamn gorgeous corpses.

129
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,055
I'd fuck our corpses.

130
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,621
What are we doing here, Eliot?

131
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:45,228
We're despairing in style, as befits
two former High Kings of Fillory.

132
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,926
On that note, it's 3:00,

133
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,278
when I usually ask you if
you'd like to talk about Quentin.

134
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,601
And I usually
respond, "I'm fine."

135
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:54,664
With the help of some
liberally-applied libations.

136
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,441
I would prefer to focus on
our current hopeless situation.

137
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,847
You know, I gotta
give it to this Dark King.

138
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:03,944
All the patrols and
heightened security

139
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:06,486
have made it impossible
to get into his castle.

140
00:08:06,553 --> 00:08:08,954
We tried for a week.
That seems like enough.

141
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:12,016
Although "Dark
King" is a little generic

142
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,525
as villain names go. Mmm.

143
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,185
Wouldn't you say? I have notes.

144
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:18,629
Like, we get it. You're a despot.
You're the fucking Dark King.

145
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,966
Although he is
somewhat effective.

146
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:24,664
Everyone seems terrified
of him, like the bunnies.

147
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,206
They did seem unusually
scared. They did.

148
00:08:28,308 --> 00:08:31,369
I hope they got our
warning to 23. Mmm.

149
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:34,346
You know, I know we told him not
to travel here because of time shit,

150
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:38,145
but maybe we should just take the
Portal Tree back to Earth and regroup.

151
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,515
I think it's not safe to leave
until we figure out the time shit.

152
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:45,119
What if we go back and bam,
it's 300 years later on Earth?

153
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:48,893
If we could just figure
out a way into his castle

154
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:52,124
and find out what happened to Josh
and Fen, we might be in a better position.

155
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,394
Bambi, we're 300
years in the future.

156
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:56,163
All signs point to "not good."

157
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,661
Look, Josh is a
fucking Magician.

158
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,841
Maybe he baked an
immortality cake or something.

159
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,407
Plus, it's Fillory.

160
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:06,371
Weirdness abounds.

161
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:10,249
Huh.

162
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,911
I guess these people didn't get
the memo they're living in a dystopia.

163
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,620
A fine unshackling
to you, pilgrims.

164
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:19,725
Hello.

165
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:22,695
I see you've gotten a head
start on today's festivities.

166
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,323
Right.

167
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:28,363
I'm... I'm Pree.

168
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:33,871
And, uh, you two must
be High King Margo

169
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,966
and High King Eliot.

170
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,342
Um, what? Now, guess who I am.

171
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:40,712
Come on.

172
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,087
High King Fen the Toeless.

173
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,546
Not bad, right? They're
cosplaying as us.

174
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:54,124
Hey, so where's this big party?
- Yeah.

175
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:56,522
You two really
have been drinking.

176
00:09:57,197 --> 00:10:00,827
There's only one place to
celebrate the Great Unshackling.

177
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:04,363
Castle Whitespire.
Castle Whitespire.

178
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,748
Castle Whitespire. Of
course. Where else?

179
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,652
We want to get there before all the
good seats are gone, so come with us.

180
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,600
Come on. Come on.

181
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,975
It can't be that easy,
can it? I guess so.

182
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,160
Good afternoon, Alice.

183
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,290
It is afternoon, you know.

184
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:40,005
You got another
letter from the Library.

185
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:50,273
You know, they're just gonna keep
sending them unless you respond.

186
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:53,752
I know.

187
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,152
I already told them no.

188
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,582
I'm just bad at listening.

189
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:02,526
Alice, you know, I have no
problem with you living here.

190
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:06,357
And it is your business if
you want to let yourself go.

191
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:09,061
But right now I
need you to put on,

192
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,866
you know, whatever
fits and help me.

193
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:13,968
It's an emergency.

194
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,080
You want my help to cheat?

195
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:23,249
Not cheat. Pick.

196
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:27,450
It's my ladies' garden club
perennial orchid competition,

197
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:29,555
and, well, I want to win.

198
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,719
But none of them
are Magicians, right?

199
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,335
Yeah, but that doesn't mean

200
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,839
they're not a bunch
of mean old twats.

201
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:38,330
Mom, this is not an
emergency. Yes, it is.

202
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,500
There's too much magic, Alice.

203
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,244
Everything that I touch just...

204
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:45,261
It grows like
crazy. I'll get it.

205
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,038
Hey. Uh, can I come in?

206
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,957
Uh, welcome to Introductory
Psychic Translocation.

207
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,291
My name is Professor Adiyodi.

208
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:13,189
I see you have your
Umar, Kaminsky, Aurora.

209
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:17,301
See, I... I always
thought books would help.

210
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:23,938
Only problem is books make you think
you can do something that you shouldn't.

211
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,437
Anyone here know other
people's thoughts yet?

212
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,105
Cool.

213
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:32,276
You're gonna want to get some psychic
wards to block that shit out right now.

214
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,779
The truth? Being a
Traveler is a curse.

215
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,717
Best case scenario, you end
up a taxi service for your friends.

216
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,318
Worst case, you dream about
volcanoes and then you wake up in one.

217
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,130
What?

218
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:48,292
Yeah, are you actually
gonna teach us something,

219
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:50,461
or are you just gonna
keep trying to scare us?

220
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:56,241
Look, man. I'm trying
to be real with you.

221
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:57,910
You should be scared.

222
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:00,280
I mean, have you
even actually Travelled?

223
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:03,410
Anyone? Okay, seriously?

224
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:07,976
Get an anti-Travelling
tattoo and then just go.

225
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:09,920
Enjoy your life.

226
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,576
'Cause it'll be a hell of a lot longer
than if you stick around with this shit.

227
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,891
End of class. Peace.

228
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:23,160
I miss him, too, but a seance?

229
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,732
Well, I wanted to talk to him,
and then I realized, what if I could?

230
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,554
You know, what if we could?

231
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:33,836
Actually talking to
the dead is wild magic.

232
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,380
It's way too dangerous.

233
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,144
Well, then what should I do?

234
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:41,685
Because I don't know,
and the person I want to ask

235
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:42,788
is Q.

236
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,360
I miss him every day, too.

237
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:53,158
I honestly don't know how
to move on without him.

238
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,768
I just... But we have to, right?

239
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,184
I found it. It was his.

240
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,729
Uh, his notes are
written in the margin.

241
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,803
What a nerd.

242
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:45,213
Can't talk to him,
but can read it.

243
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,154
Picture what he was thinking.

244
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:53,621
Next best thing.

245
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,057
Um...

246
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:03,528
Is Kady here?

247
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:07,170
Let me get this straight.

248
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:11,410
Your friend tried to remove your
Reed's Mark with magic and...

249
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:14,614
Blew my arm off. Yeah.
I still can't cast, either.

250
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,882
Why not go to a hospital? I
don't have health insurance.

251
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:20,952
Well, I know a spell.

252
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:24,248
Might make you vomit,
though. Like, a lot?

253
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:26,724
One-armed beggars can't
be one-armed choosers.

254
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:31,921
Ugh.

255
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:38,728
Oh. KADY: Hold his arm in place.

256
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:41,639
Wait, wait, wait. How
much throw-up, really?

257
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:47,938
Wow.

258
00:15:48,915 --> 00:15:49,915
Thank you.

259
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,247
Uh-oh.

260
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,617
You got that look, boss.

261
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:02,321
That guy. He was so
afraid of not having magic,

262
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:04,868
he was willing to risk blowing
his own arm off to get it back.

263
00:16:05,431 --> 00:16:06,956
That guy was an idiot.

264
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:09,161
Or maybe just desperate.

265
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:12,936
So, what? It's hard to be a
Hedge? It's always been hard.

266
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,598
We could at least
defend ourselves.

267
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:17,003
I thought with magic back
things would get better.

268
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,988
The Library promised they'd remove
all of Reed's Marks, and they haven't.

269
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,173
Are you surprised?

270
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,143
I hear the Library's
falling apart,

271
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:29,120
so I doubt that fixing hedge
witches ranks high on their to-do list.

272
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,454
I'm done waiting.

273
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:33,187
There's tons of magic now.

274
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,858
So let's figure out a way
to remove them ourselves.

275
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,555
If you're serious,

276
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:41,232
I heard about a guy
who might be able to help.

277
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:45,736
An Order of the Library of the
Neitherlands medical manual

278
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,534
should have the
ritual you're looking for.

279
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,131
And why should we trust you?

280
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,668
'Cause I don't give a rat's tit
about the Library. Never have.

281
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,379
I don't even read books.

282
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,182
But you worked for them?

283
00:16:57,283 --> 00:17:00,913
Not anymore. Contracts aren't
valid once the place collapses.

284
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:05,855
Besides, I'm chaotic neutral,
so I do a lot of crazy shit.

285
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:07,989
For cash.

286
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:11,487
And since we're not here to fuck
spiders, you can pay, can't you?

287
00:17:11,564 --> 00:17:12,588
We can pay.

288
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,291
How soon can you
get us the manual?

289
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:17,928
I'm not getting it for you. I'll
just tell you where you can find it.

290
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:22,138
A former Library book depository
no one's hit yet. They'll have one.

291
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,477
And a lot more goodies besides.

292
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,207
And you're not grabbing
these goodies for yourself. Why?

293
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:30,783
Mate, if I knew how to rob that
place without getting decapitated,

294
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,681
I'd be robbing it right now.

295
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:38,847
You have all come to hear the
story of the Great Unshackling.

296
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:42,384
First, there was I,
Ember, god of Fillory.

297
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:44,728
Then came my
boring brother, Umber.

298
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:48,267
Together, we created this world.

299
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,908
But I thought it would be funny

300
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:58,035
if Fillory were ruled
by Children of Earth.

301
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,170
I am High King Eliot,

302
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:03,080
and I am drunk all the time.

303
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,343
That's original.

304
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:08,115
I am High King Margo,
and I am angry all the time.

305
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:13,089
I am King Quentin, and I
am dissatisfied all the time.

306
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:16,726
I am Queen Alice, and I died.

307
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:18,891
Sort of.

308
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:20,558
It's complicated.

309
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,033
The Children of
Earth came and went,

310
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,729
doing their Children
of Earth things,

311
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:26,830
like chewing loudly and texting.

312
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:28,932
One of them even killed me.

313
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:33,442
Which was not funny, but
at least it was unexpected.

314
00:18:35,748 --> 00:18:37,793
He neglected to mention he
was gonna destroy the world.

315
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:38,817
True that, girl. Shh.

316
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:43,151
No matter who was in charge,
Fillory remained shackled to them.

317
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,856
Which brings us to these two.

318
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:49,020
Ooh.

319
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,791
I am High King Fen the Toeless,

320
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:54,163
and I like knives.

321
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:59,170
I am Josh the Fresh
Prince, and I love to eat.

322
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,307
Also, I have a mustache.

323
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:02,641
Oh.

324
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:04,742
Guess Josh must have gone
through a mustache phase.

325
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,841
So they weren't paying
attention when it happened.

326
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:10,178
The Takers came into Fillory.

327
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:11,807
The borderlands became overrun.

328
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:14,149
The people fled for their lives.

329
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:16,112
Boo.

330
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:17,281
Boo.

331
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,156
What's a Taker? I don't know.

332
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:22,838
No one knows where the Takers
came from, but they were everywhere.

333
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:25,889
- The people asked for help.
- But we didn't do anything.

334
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,330
The people prayed.

335
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:28,833
There were no
more gods in Fillory,

336
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,665
yet their prayers were
answered anyway.

337
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,863
I will save the
people of Fillory.

338
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,611
Who was this mysterious hero?

339
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:42,137
Oh, just a humble wizard
coming to you out of the darkness.

340
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,844
Eventually, the
people would decide

341
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,352
to make this dark
wizard their king.

342
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:48,677
The Dark King.

343
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,559
I promise to protect
you as long as I live.

344
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,252
And I shall live forever.

345
00:19:55,828 --> 00:20:00,061
But before this could happen,
the people handed out just deserts.

346
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:02,878
To the gallows!

347
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:10,833
Did somebody say "desert"?

348
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:22,846
As we cast off the
shackles of our past,

349
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:26,890
I declare today will be known
hence as the Great Unshackling.

350
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:31,189
And the people of Fillory
lived happily ever after.

351
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:45,609
Margo, for God's sake,
would you just come back?

352
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:47,873
They murdered them. They
murdered the shit out of them.

353
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:51,281
Okay, yeah, like, 300
years ago. All right?

354
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:55,046
Look, maybe you didn't have
time to prepare yourself for this,

355
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:57,720
but you have to know it
didn't end well for them.

356
00:20:58,057 --> 00:21:00,322
Yeah, well, it's not over yet.

357
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,292
We're gonna <i>Endgame</i> this shit.

358
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:05,592
When did you have
time to go see <i>Endgame?</i>

359
00:21:05,698 --> 00:21:06,961
Does it matter?

360
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:09,467
All I'm saying is we're
gonna time-fix this bitch.

361
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:12,968
In the center of Fillory is a
clockwork heart built by dwarves.

362
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:17,136
They're the ones who taught
Jane Chatwin how to do time magic.

363
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:20,407
Jesus Helena Bonham Christ.
Read the books already, El.

364
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:21,606
Uh...

365
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:23,080
We're gonna dial back the clock

366
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:25,516
300 years to before
all this bullshit.

367
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,590
Right. So I guess we just
have to somehow find our way

368
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:32,318
to the center of the world then?

369
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:36,827
When I was High King, I
started excavations to reach it.

370
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,527
I wanted to meet
the Clock dwarf,

371
00:21:40,366 --> 00:21:42,767
who takes care of
the clockwork heart.

372
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:45,598
Come on.

373
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:17,567
So, we're actually going to
slide to the center of the world?

374
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,229
Oh, grow a clit, will you?

375
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,163
Bitch, I would if I could.

376
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:49,246
<i>So what made you
change your mind?</i>

377
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,837
I need to get out of the house,

378
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,998
and your request
seemed the least annoying.

379
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:58,036
You promise you won't
ask me to join the Library?

380
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:02,513
Promise. I just need a
phosphoromancer for, like, an afternoon.

381
00:23:03,282 --> 00:23:04,282
Fine.

382
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:18,353
Motherfucker. I have a
serious case of slide-ass.

383
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:23,294
Yeah. I think I lost several
pounds to friction burn, as well.

384
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:25,865
Welcome, adventurers.

385
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,038
Wait. You're the Clock Dwarf?

386
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:31,304
Huh. I thought you'd be smaller.

387
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:34,212
'Cause I deal with clocks?

388
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,482
'Cause on Earth,
"dwarf" means small.

389
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:40,648
Really? Is Earth really big?

390
00:23:42,488 --> 00:23:45,048
So, tell me. Did you happen
to bring any food with you?

391
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:46,457
Uh...

392
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,557
Were we supposed to
bring you some food?

393
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:49,704
I mean, you didn't have to.

394
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:52,357
I just figured if you came
all that way from the surface,

395
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,230
you might have some
hearty adventuring snacks,

396
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:58,032
like bread and maybe ham,

397
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:03,599
and cheese and lettuce and
perhaps some assorted condiments.

398
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,805
Sounds like you
want a ham sandwich.

399
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:08,470
If you're offering
a ham sandwich...

400
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:10,081
I'm not.

401
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:13,983
Ah. I see. It's just...

402
00:24:14,653 --> 00:24:17,987
I don't get out much on account
of the massive disruptions

403
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:21,219
in the flow of time that
happens when I do.

404
00:24:22,494 --> 00:24:25,862
I get by on cave mushrooms.

405
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,128
They're fine.

406
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:32,269
Um, we were hoping you
might be able to help us.

407
00:24:32,538 --> 00:24:34,769
Earth and Fillory
kinda fell out of sync.

408
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:40,105
On Earth, barely any time has
passed, while here, it's been 300 years.

409
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:44,481
Uh, big old surge of magic
skipped the gears forward.

410
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:48,078
I had to crank down on
it before it went too far.

411
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,816
Okay, how about you just
wind it back 300 years then?

412
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:55,291
Eh, can't. These clock gears
aren't made to go backward.

413
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:59,361
I could probably jump you
forward 300 years if you want.

414
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:02,800
Why the shit would we want to
go another 300 years in the future?

415
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:04,708
Why would you want to
go 300 years in the past?

416
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,244
Because all our friends are
dead and the world is fucked.

417
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:08,867
Oh, wow.

418
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:11,206
Sorry.

419
00:25:11,577 --> 00:25:14,206
These mushrooms,
they also get me high,

420
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:17,482
so I don't always pick
up on emotional cues.

421
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:19,917
Look.

422
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:22,682
You're a smart
dwarf, right? Yeah.

423
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:26,183
There's got to be
some way to skip back.

424
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:30,558
I mean, this whole thing is
already impossible, isn't it?

425
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,031
We're sorry we didn't
bring you snacks.

426
00:25:33,132 --> 00:25:35,397
No, this isn't even
about the snacks.

427
00:25:35,601 --> 00:25:38,571
If I wound the clock
backward, it would just be bad.

428
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:41,473
How bad? 'Cause it's bad now.

429
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:44,877
Like apocalypse bad.
It would destroy Fillory.

430
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:48,407
So, I'm sorry. I wish
I could help you.

431
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:52,050
You guys want some
cave mushrooms?

432
00:25:56,055 --> 00:25:57,956
Look on the bright side, Bambi.

433
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:01,050
We just got to slide
up back to the surface,

434
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,958
which hurt a lot less
than on the way down,

435
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:06,692
and now we get to hole up in a
lovely villa on the Grand Canal

436
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:08,597
and sip Bellinis
until we pass out.

437
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,759
We can't leave Fillory.

438
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:11,780
I don't want to tell you
that things are hopeless,

439
00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:13,363
but they're not
looking very good.

440
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:15,775
And I hate to see
you feeling like this.

441
00:26:16,442 --> 00:26:17,876
I'm not gonna feel better.

442
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:21,925
What the hell is wrong with
you? You should feel just as upset.

443
00:26:23,182 --> 00:26:26,619
Uh... I don't know. I guess
it takes a lot to upset me.

444
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:29,517
I think you're gloriously medicated
and in some textbook denial.

445
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:31,518
I'm managing.

446
00:26:33,725 --> 00:26:35,626
I'm fine. Sure. You're fine.

447
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:40,760
A monster rode you around for
months while he murdered people.

448
00:26:41,467 --> 00:26:43,527
And then one of your
closest friends died.

449
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:49,536
You know, I don't remember
anything from in there.

450
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:52,137
As if that changes
a goddamn thing.

451
00:26:54,713 --> 00:26:57,376
Quentin died, and it hurts.

452
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:00,545
And I don't really
want to talk about it.

453
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,588
Everything I have to
say, you already know.

454
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:05,419
So, why?

455
00:27:07,493 --> 00:27:09,121
Well, if it were me,

456
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:13,122
I'd be driving a fucking
semi down Fury Road.

457
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:17,129
Yeah, well, feelings are gauche,

458
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:19,671
and I'm sparing you mine, and
I thought you would be grateful.

459
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:22,118
I don't care what you're
like out there, but with me,

460
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:25,740
I thought you'd at
least try to be real.

461
00:27:27,513 --> 00:27:31,041
Bambi. Don't "Bambi" me.

462
00:27:31,884 --> 00:27:34,564
If you're gonna be this stupid, I
need some time alone to calm down.

463
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:38,523
Fine.

464
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:53,968
Hey. Banished scum.

465
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:00,171
What happened here?

466
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,380
Been a rough couple of weeks.
Everyone's abandoned us.

467
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,708
We've lost most of the branches.

468
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:08,185
Can't even reach our
people in the Underworld.

469
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:12,218
Where's Zelda?

470
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:14,793
- Oh, God, who knows?
- She's a mess.

471
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:16,386
Look, no bullshit.

472
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:19,988
After you refused to help
her for, like, the fifteenth time,

473
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:24,500
I think it broke her brain. She said
she can't be trusted to lead and ran off.

474
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,866
Then who's leading the Library?

475
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:30,336
Well, not me, that's for
sure. I'm just doing my job.

476
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,519
That's a Library
Branch Index, isn't it?

477
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:37,501
You know about these?
I've heard a couple things.

478
00:28:37,683 --> 00:28:41,586
Okay, well, it shows you the location
of every volume and how to access it.

479
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:43,955
Mmm. So, what's
the problem then?

480
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:49,252
The phosphoromancer
who did this is dead.

481
00:28:49,361 --> 00:28:50,590
I need you to unlock it.

482
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,871
If you're gonna
watch, I'll need a drink.

483
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,768
Yeah, I could use one myself.

484
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,904
Ugh.

485
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:13,544
I think there's a bit of confusion
about the nature of your job.

486
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,548
You told me they'd get
killed if I didn't talk to them,

487
00:29:16,622 --> 00:29:19,091
so I told them how
not to get killed.

488
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:21,217
Well, how very
thoughtful of you.

489
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:22,454
Look, man.

490
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:25,793
I was doing you a solid,
but I don't think I'm your guy.

491
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:30,733
This is the time, as a dean, where
I usually dig deep to find a funny

492
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:32,896
or sad anecdote to win you back.

493
00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:37,743
But since I've stopped drinking,
those no longer come easy.

494
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,778
You stopped drinking? Yes.

495
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,505
I've lost the taste
for it, I'm afraid.

496
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:44,639
Maybe it's what
happened to Quentin.

497
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:46,949
Maybe it's just my liver.

498
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,645
Either way, I'm a bit
raw at the moment,

499
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:51,417
so you will forgive
my bluntness.

500
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:53,716
You signed a contract.

501
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,337
I thought that was,
like, to protect me.

502
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:57,420
I lied.

503
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,629
It was an employment contract,
which forbids you from quitting.

504
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:04,528
I've never met a Penny
who read the fine print.

505
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,465
So what if I break it?

506
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:09,807
Well, I will sue
you into oblivion.

507
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,942
Could you fight it?
Yes. Would you win? No.

508
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:16,006
Could you run?

509
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:19,382
- Well, yes, of course.
- You're a Traveler.

510
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,480
But I doubt a world exists

511
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:23,351
where you could
hide from our lawyers.

512
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:27,617
I will see you at
school, Professor.

513
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:33,626
Not that there's anything
wrong with masturbation.

514
00:30:33,699 --> 00:30:36,635
There's a tradition of
librarians masturbating.

515
00:30:36,702 --> 00:30:41,800
It goes back centuries. But
just the way he did it was creepy.

516
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,869
Mmm. Whew.

517
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:49,004
God damn. I need to pee.

518
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:52,009
Holy shit.

519
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:58,049
Apologies, my good lady, for
the intrusion into your <i>maison.</i>

520
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:00,642
And... And for startling you.

521
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:05,622
And for raiding your magical
winter box of comestibles.

522
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:08,284
It has been a long
and arduous journey.

523
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,860
Find...

524
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:11,595
Who are you?

525
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:16,124
I am Sir Hargreave Mcgrubney Cubbins
Archibald Brian Effingham the Third.

526
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:18,836
But you can call
me Sir Effingham.

527
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,204
Are you from Fillory?

528
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,477
Why, yes, I am. Well deduced.

529
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:30,081
You are a credit to your sex.

530
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:34,108
Gonna move past that. Um...

531
00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:35,419
What brings you here to Earth?

532
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,985
I am here on a mission
of dreadful import.

533
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:41,089
It is not an exaggeration to say

534
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:44,857
that the very fate of both of
our worlds lies in the balance.

535
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:47,631
You're here to bestow a quest.

536
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:49,964
I am here to bestow a quest.

537
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:54,768
You know, this
timing is perfect.

538
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,605
Because, honestly, I've
been feeling a little lost lately.

539
00:32:57,676 --> 00:33:01,340
And I've been looking for
something to do with my magic

540
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:04,439
to make a difference. You
know, searching for a sign.

541
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:07,847
And here you are. Here I am.

542
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:10,282
So, tell me. How can I help you?

543
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:13,717
You can help me find
Quentin Coldwater.

544
00:33:16,962 --> 00:33:17,962
Oh...

545
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:24,527
Yeah. Um... No, that's not...

546
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,004
Perhaps you have
been beset by hysteria.

547
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:31,132
Is your corset too tight?

548
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:34,805
It can cause the womb to
wander. I've seen it happen.

549
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:40,218
Um, no, you can't talk to
Quentin because he's dead.

550
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:41,342
He died.

551
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:47,391
Oh, dear. Oh, dear, oh dear,
oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

552
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:51,028
I do believe I'm
having the hog sweats.

553
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,721
Are you... Are you all right?

554
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:55,926
No, my dear lady. I
do not believe that I am.

555
00:33:56,301 --> 00:33:59,328
You see, this matter
that brings me here,

556
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:02,772
it is somewhat
apocalyptic in nature.

557
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:07,178
Oh, I find that I do
not feel at all well.

558
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:10,773
Perhaps you could pour me
a draft of medicinal cocaine?

559
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:11,941
Oh.

560
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,678
Yeah, that's not a
thing we use anymore.

561
00:34:13,752 --> 00:34:16,620
Have you not modern medicine
in this godforsaken world?

562
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:18,848
Oh, this is truly the end times.

563
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:22,599
Well, maybe I could
help you to save the world.

564
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:25,790
Yes. Very good.

565
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:28,566
Oh, you're serious?

566
00:34:29,167 --> 00:34:34,037
No, no, no. You see, I'm afraid
that that would be far too difficult

567
00:34:34,105 --> 00:34:36,631
for someone like you to handle.

568
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:40,644
You know, I have saved the world
before. I was an actual goddess.

569
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,647
And you are still quite
fetching, albeit unmarried.

570
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:47,416
Look, the nature of the
quest that I must deliver,

571
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:50,648
well, it requires a
certain kind of hero.

572
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:53,254
And what kind of
hero would that be?

573
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:57,957
Well, that is to say, to
use the common tongue,

574
00:34:58,063 --> 00:35:02,125
a hero with a pork loin.

575
00:35:05,737 --> 00:35:08,935
So, the apocalypse is
happening, or whatever,

576
00:35:09,007 --> 00:35:12,239
and this little piggy
comes all this way,

577
00:35:12,544 --> 00:35:16,072
but you won't accept my
help because I'm a woman?

578
00:35:16,748 --> 00:35:21,186
Quite right. Well, I have a
long journey ahead of me.

579
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:24,313
This has been a
dreadful setback,

580
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:28,086
but I am sure that
a hero will rise,

581
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:30,185
and he will save us.

582
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:39,438
Madam, I have heard
from many trusted sources

583
00:35:39,504 --> 00:35:42,474
that hysteria such as
yours can be cured,

584
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:46,473
temporarily, through
pelvic massage.

585
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:50,440
I must go.

586
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:57,853
Look familiar?

587
00:35:59,057 --> 00:36:03,495
This building, our
target. It's missing.

588
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:06,330
Maybe it's some kind of
optical displacement spell?

589
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:08,491
Like the building's hidden?

590
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,900
Come on.

591
00:36:13,138 --> 00:36:16,040
Hey, man, can you tell me, did
there used to be a building here?

592
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:17,700
Don't think so. Are you sure?

593
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:20,121
I mean, I've only worked in
this park for, like, eight years.

594
00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:22,137
But, yeah, maybe
I'm wrong about it.

595
00:36:26,084 --> 00:36:28,349
Well, guy says there
was never a building here.

596
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,621
So, looks like
Gavin ripped us off.

597
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:33,552
He didn't rip us off.
There was a building.

598
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:36,152
I can still see the
residue from the wards.

599
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:37,721
So what happened to it?

600
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:42,156
I think someone stole it, then
mind-wiped everyone in the area.

601
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:46,903
Do you know what kind of skills
it would take to steal a building

602
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:50,032
with Level Five wards?
That's like, Gandalf-level skills.

603
00:36:50,108 --> 00:36:53,010
That's like... Wait.
Gandalf was a wizard, right?

604
00:36:53,078 --> 00:36:56,571
Pete, just... Shit.

605
00:36:58,116 --> 00:37:00,085
I think we might have
some competition.

606
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:02,382
So, the apocalypse is coming,

607
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:05,287
but don't worry your pretty little
head about it? What are we gonna do?

608
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:08,344
It's not like he's the first guy
to tell me I'm not good enough.

609
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:11,886
Right. And how screwed is the
universe that it doesn't even realize

610
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:13,693
Quentin's dead
and plan around it?

611
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:17,725
Truth? I don't think the universe
is really looking out for anyone.

612
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:20,266
Try saying that
to your students.

613
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:23,368
I think I've already told
them all the depressing things.

614
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:25,886
I can't believe I
have to go back.

615
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,503
What the fuck am I
gonna say to them?

616
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:32,108
Well, what would you say if you
could say anything you wanted?

617
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:33,715
'Cause you can.

618
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,781
What would you say to the pig?

619
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,259
I'd say,

620
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:43,854
"Hey, Porky.

621
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:46,895
"If I wait for you to
tell me to be the hero,

622
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:48,866
"then I'm just buying
into your bullshit."

623
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:52,932
In real life you don't get
chosen. You choose your quest.

624
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:57,470
And I'm choosing mine. Yeah.

625
00:37:57,976 --> 00:38:00,309
You know, I got magic
back because Quentin died,

626
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:02,572
and I think I know what
I'm gonna do with it.

627
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:06,979
I'm gonna figure out what's causing
the apocalypse, and I'm gonna stop it.

628
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:17,159
When I got to Brakebills, I
thought I'd die before I turned 30.

629
00:38:17,996 --> 00:38:20,488
That's all anyone ever
told me. Travelers die.

630
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:24,327
And bad shit has happened
to me, but not to you.

631
00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:26,364
Not yet, anyway.

632
00:38:27,338 --> 00:38:29,273
You still get a choice
about your path.

633
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:32,968
And since I already
talked about the bad side,

634
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:35,446
I should probably show
you the good side, too.

635
00:38:36,915 --> 00:38:39,350
Anyone who wants
to see that, come here.

636
00:38:48,026 --> 00:38:50,791
Cool. You brought us to rocks.

637
00:38:59,304 --> 00:39:00,304
Look up.

638
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:04,708
Whoa.

639
00:39:04,809 --> 00:39:06,654
A few years ago, I was
running from some bad shit,

640
00:39:06,678 --> 00:39:07,839
and I found this place.

641
00:39:08,213 --> 00:39:09,647
It's not on any map.

642
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,341
You guys can breathe.

643
00:39:13,418 --> 00:39:14,943
There's no one here. Just us.

644
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,019
Oh, my God.

645
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:19,251
When you master your powers,
you can wake up anywhere,

646
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,223
in any world.

647
00:39:22,794 --> 00:39:26,424
If you want to still do this, I'll
help you. Just think about it.

648
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:32,197
For now, I'm gonna shut up
and let you enjoy this place.

649
00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:40,802
Professor Adiyodi?

650
00:39:41,346 --> 00:39:42,871
Merritt, right? Yeah.

651
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:44,839
I had a question.

652
00:39:45,984 --> 00:39:48,283
You said you heard
voices from other worlds.

653
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:49,815
You hearing something?

654
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:54,383
It's not a voice. It's
more like, um, a signal.

655
00:39:55,193 --> 00:39:57,924
Okay. Um... Uh, sit down.

656
00:39:58,029 --> 00:39:59,156
Yeah.

657
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,392
I'm gonna take down my
wards so you can show me.

658
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:03,867
You just, uh, close
your eyes, okay? Okay.

659
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:04,935
All right.

660
00:40:32,397 --> 00:40:33,397
Professor?

661
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:39,894
Oh. Professor, what happened?

662
00:40:39,971 --> 00:40:41,769
I don't... I couldn't
control myself.

663
00:40:42,941 --> 00:40:44,569
Did the signal make you do that?

664
00:41:01,326 --> 00:41:04,319
Hello? Anybody there?

665
00:41:15,273 --> 00:41:18,766
Just great. What are you
gonna do now, Margo?

666
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:27,616
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

667
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,846
It's... Who am I kidding?

668
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:33,954
They're gonna chop
my goddamn head off.

669
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:39,859
Josh? Josh. Josh.

670
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,527
Of course I get trapped in here
with the ghost loop version of him.

671
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:51,139
Margo, wherever you
are, I hope you're okay.

672
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,439
I wish you were here.

673
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,709
I wish I wasn't gonna die alone.

674
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:32,949
Oh.

675
00:42:36,521 --> 00:42:39,252
Why are you
smoking? I don't know.

676
00:42:40,925 --> 00:42:42,689
Quentin did sometimes.

677
00:42:43,728 --> 00:42:44,728
Can I have one?

678
00:42:49,434 --> 00:42:53,098
You know, you're the only person in
the world who can smoke judgmentally.

679
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,872
I know what you're
going through.

680
00:42:57,909 --> 00:43:01,778
When your father died, I was a
wreck. I didn't know what to do.

681
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:06,415
I wasn't ready to be alone. I
didn't even know how to be alone.

682
00:43:06,818 --> 00:43:09,583
I did some pretty insane
things just to get by.

683
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:16,221
Insane even for me. But
I'll spare you the details.

684
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:17,822
Doesn't sound like you.

685
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:20,122
Well, I could tell
you, if you prefer.

686
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,699
What's your point, Mom?

687
00:43:23,468 --> 00:43:26,165
That everything's just
gonna get better eventually?

688
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:29,734
No one gets to tell
you how to grieve, Alice.

689
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:33,602
You're on this
journey by yourself.

690
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:37,414
Only you know where
it's gonna take you.

691
00:43:38,850 --> 00:43:42,548
If you need to do something
crazy to get through it,

692
00:43:44,322 --> 00:43:46,120
do something crazy, okay?
