00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:40,650
because of time shit,
but maybe we should just

183
00:08:40,694 --> 00:08:42,739
take the Portal Tree back
to Earth and regroup?

184
00:08:42,783 --> 00:08:44,654
I think it's not
safe to leave until

185
00:08:44,698 --> 00:08:46,351
we figure out the time shit.

186
00:08:46,395 --> 00:08:48,136
What if we go back and bam...

187
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:50,225
It's 300 years later on Earth?

188
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:53,097
If we could just figure out
a way into his castle

189
00:08:53,141 --> 00:08:55,622
and find out what
happened to Josh and Fen,

190
00:08:55,665 --> 00:08:56,971
we might be
in a better position.

191
00:08:57,014 --> 00:08:59,103
Bambi, we're 300 years
in the future.

192
00:08:59,147 --> 00:09:01,018
All signs point to not good.

193
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:03,804
Look, Josh is a... Magician.

194
00:09:03,847 --> 00:09:06,589
Maybe he baked an
immortality cake or something.

195
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:08,852
Plus, it's Fillory.

196
00:09:08,896 --> 00:09:11,594
Weirdness abounds.

197
00:09:11,638 --> 00:09:14,118
(LAUGHTER)

198
00:09:15,642 --> 00:09:17,054
I guess these people
didn't get the memo

199
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:18,949
they're living in a dystopia.

200
00:09:20,647 --> 00:09:24,041
A fine Unshackling
to you pilgrims.

201
00:09:24,085 --> 00:09:27,697
I see you've gotten a head
start on today's festivities.

202
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:33,007
- Right...
- I'm... I'm Pree.

203
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,750
And, uh, you two must be...

204
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:40,623
High King Margo
and High King Eliot.

205
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,190
Um, what?

206
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:44,235
Now, guess who I am.

207
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,715
Come on.

208
00:09:49,371 --> 00:09:52,896
High King Fen the Toeless.
(LAUGHING)

209
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,984
Not bad, right?

210
00:09:54,028 --> 00:09:55,333
They're cosplaying as us.

211
00:09:55,377 --> 00:09:57,988
Hey, so where's this big party?

212
00:09:58,032 --> 00:09:59,250
Yeah.

213
00:09:59,294 --> 00:10:01,339
You two really
have been drinking.

214
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:03,254
There's only one place

215
00:10:03,298 --> 00:10:06,170
to celebrate
the Great Unshackling.

216
00:10:06,214 --> 00:10:08,042
Castle Whitespire!

217
00:10:08,085 --> 00:10:09,391
BOTH: Castle Whitespire.

218
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:10,740
Of course, where else?

219
00:10:10,784 --> 00:10:11,741
We wanna get there before

220
00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:12,742
all the good seats are gone,

221
00:10:12,786 --> 00:10:13,917
so come with us. Come on.

222
00:10:13,961 --> 00:10:15,179
Come on.

223
00:10:15,223 --> 00:10:16,746
It can't be that easy, can it?

224
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,226
I guess so.

225
00:10:26,321 --> 00:10:28,802
(KNOCKING)

226
00:10:32,283 --> 00:10:34,982
Good afternoon, Alice.

227
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:38,986
It is afternoon, you know.

228
00:10:40,857 --> 00:10:44,992
You got another letter
from the Library.

229
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:50,127
You know...

230
00:10:50,171 --> 00:10:52,695
they're just gonna
keep sending them

231
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:55,219
unless you respond.

232
00:10:57,265 --> 00:10:59,920
I know, I already told them no.

233
00:10:59,963 --> 00:11:02,705
They're just bad at listening.

234
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:07,405
Alice, you know I have no
problem with you living here,

235
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:11,235
and it is your business
if you want to let yourself go,

236
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,890
but right now
I need you to put on...

237
00:11:13,934 --> 00:11:15,457
you know, whatever fits

238
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,893
and help me.

239
00:11:16,937 --> 00:11:19,026
It's an emergency.

240
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,946
You want my help to cheat?

241
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:28,165
Not cheat, pick.

242
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:31,865
It's my ladies' garden club
perennial orchid competition,

243
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:34,389
and, well, I wanna win.

244
00:11:34,432 --> 00:11:36,739
But none of them
are Magicians, right?

245
00:11:36,783 --> 00:11:38,108
Yeah, but that
doesn't mean they're not

246
00:11:38,132 --> 00:11:39,524
a bunch of mean old twats.

247
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:41,744
Mom, this is not an emergency.

248
00:11:41,788 --> 00:11:45,182
- Yes it is.
- There's too much magic, Alice.

249
00:11:45,226 --> 00:11:47,271
Everything that I touch just...

250
00:11:47,315 --> 00:11:48,553
(KNOCK AT DOOR)
It grows like crazy.

251
00:11:48,577 --> 00:11:50,840
I'll get it.

252
00:11:58,065 --> 00:12:00,023
Hey, uh, can I come in?

253
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:11,426
Uh, welcome to Introductory
Psychic Translocation.

254
00:12:11,469 --> 00:12:13,689
My name is Professor Adiyodi.

255
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:17,867
I see you have your
Umar, Kaminsky, Aurora...

256
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:22,829
See, I always thought
books would help, but...

257
00:12:24,482 --> 00:12:26,528
The only problem is,
books make you think

258
00:12:26,571 --> 00:12:28,617
you can do something
that you shouldn't.

259
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,750
Anyone hearing other
people's thoughts yet?

260
00:12:31,881 --> 00:12:34,710
Cool, you're gonna wanna
get some psychic wards

261
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,712
to block that
shit out right now.

262
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,801
The truth?
Being a traveler is a curse.

263
00:12:38,845 --> 00:12:40,324
Best case scenario?

264
00:12:40,368 --> 00:12:41,824
You end up a taxi service
for your friends.

265
00:12:41,848 --> 00:12:42,979
Worst case?

266
00:12:43,023 --> 00:12:44,285
You dream about volcanoes,

267
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:45,765
and then you wake up in one.

268
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,551
What?

269
00:12:49,594 --> 00:12:50,813
Yeah,

270
00:12:50,857 --> 00:12:52,684
are you actually
gonna teach us something

271
00:12:52,728 --> 00:12:55,557
or are you just gonna
keep trying to scare us?

272
00:12:57,689 --> 00:12:58,778
Look, man,

273
00:12:58,821 --> 00:13:00,649
I'm trying to be real with you.

274
00:13:00,692 --> 00:13:02,346
You should be scared.

275
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,653
I mean, have you even
actually traveled?

276
00:13:04,696 --> 00:13:06,307
Anyone?

277
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,613
Okay... seriously,

278
00:13:08,657 --> 00:13:10,267
get an anti-traveling tattoo

279
00:13:10,311 --> 00:13:12,748
and then just go.

280
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,402
Enjoy your life.

281
00:13:14,445 --> 00:13:15,858
'Cause it'd be
a hell of a lot longer

282
00:13:15,882 --> 00:13:17,884
than if you stick around
with this shit.

283
00:13:17,927 --> 00:13:19,407
End of class.

284
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,582
Peace.

285
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,370
I miss him too, but

286
00:13:26,414 --> 00:13:27,850
a séance?

287
00:13:27,894 --> 00:13:29,634
Well, I wanted to talk to him,

288
00:13:29,678 --> 00:13:30,940
and then I realized

289
00:13:30,984 --> 00:13:32,681
what if I could?

290
00:13:32,724 --> 00:13:33,804
You know, what if we could?

291
00:13:34,988 --> 00:13:38,774
Actually talking
to the dead is wild magic.

292
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,776
It's way too dangerous.

293
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,647
Well, then what should I do?

294
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:45,041
Because I don't know, and
the person I wanna ask...

295
00:13:45,085 --> 00:13:47,348
is Q.

296
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,832
I miss him every day too.

297
00:13:54,616 --> 00:13:57,749
I honestly don't know
how to move on without him.

298
00:13:57,793 --> 00:13:59,969
I just... but we have to, right?

299
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,472
I found it.

300
00:14:24,515 --> 00:14:26,039
It was his.

Let me get this straight.

Your friend tried
to remove your Reed's Mark

312
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,827
with magic, and...

313
00:15:15,871 --> 00:15:17,829
- Blew my arm off, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

314
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:18,981
I still can't cast, either.

You got that look, boss.

329

That guy...

330
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,574
he was so afraid
of not having magic,

331
00:16:06,617 --> 00:16:07,879
he was willing to risk

332
00:16:07,923 --> 00:16:09,205
blowing his own arm off
to get it back.

333
00:16:09,229 --> 00:16:11,231
That guy was an idiot.

- So what?
- It's hard to be a Hedge?

336
00:16:15,931 --> 00:16:17,063
It's always been hard.

337
00:16:17,106 --> 00:16:18,934
We could at least
defend ourselves.

338
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,502
I thought with magic back,
things would get better.

339
00:16:21,545 --> 00:16:23,088
The Library promised they'd
remove all of Reed's Marks,

340

and they haven't.

Are you surprised?

342
00:16:25,897 --> 00:16:28,596
I hear the Library's
falling apart.

343
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,599
So I doubt that
fixing hedge witches

344
00:16:31,642 --> 00:16:33,601
ranks high on their to-do list.

00:16:33,644 --> 00:16:35,820
Well, I'm done waiting.

There's tons of magic now,

347
00:16:37,692 --> 00:16:40,608
so let's figure out a way
to remove them ourselves.

If you're serious,

349
00:16:42,827 --> 00:16:45,569
I heard about a guy
who might be able to help.

the ritual you're looking for.

- Not anymore.

Contracts aren't valid
once the place collapses.

Besides, I'm chaotic neutral,

359
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:10,203
so I do a lot of crazy shit...

360
00:17:10,246 --> 00:17:12,814
for cash.

00:17:12,857 --> 00:17:14,139

363
00:17:15,686 --> 00:17:16,992
We can pay.

364
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,646
How soon can you
get us the manual?

365
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:20,648
(LAUGHS)
I'm not getting it for you.

366
00:17:20,691 --> 00:17:22,278
I'll just tell you
where you can find it.

367
00:17:22,302 --> 00:17:25,000
A former Library book
depository no one's hit yet.

368
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,828
They'll have one...

369
00:17:26,871 --> 00:17:28,699
and a lot more goodies, besides.

370
00:17:28,743 --> 00:17:31,659
And you're not grabbing these
goodies for yourself, why?

371
00:17:31,702 --> 00:17:33,835
Mate, if I knew
how to rob that place

372
00:17:33,878 --> 00:17:36,533
without getting decapitated,
I'd be robbing it right now.

373
00:17:39,797 --> 00:17:41,277
You have all come to hear

374
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:43,149
the story of
the Great Unshackling.

375
00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:46,848
First, there was I,
Ember, God of Fillory.

376
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:49,155
Then came my boring
brother, Umber.

377
00:17:49,198 --> 00:17:52,288
Together we created this world.

(CROWD EXCLAIMS)

379
00:17:58,207 --> 00:18:00,688
But I thought it would
be funny if Fillory

380
00:18:00,731 --> 00:18:02,646
were ruled by Children of Earth.

381
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,648
I am High King Eliot,

382
00:18:04,692 --> 00:18:07,173
and I am drunk all the time.

- (LAUGHTER)
- I am King Quentin,

I am Queen Alice,

389
00:18:19,402 --> 00:18:21,317
and I died,

390
00:18:21,361 --> 00:18:22,884
sort of.

391
00:18:22,927 --> 00:18:24,712

395

One of them even killed me,

396
00:18:33,242 --> 00:18:35,157
which was not funny,

397
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:37,855

No matter who was in charge,

402
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:47,387
Fillory remained
shackled to them,

403
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,171
which brings us to...

404
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,259
these two.

405
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:56,178
I am High King Fen the Toeless,

00:18:56,222 --> 00:18:57,919

00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:05,753
Also I have a mustache.

410
00:19:05,796 --> 00:19:07,276
Huh.

411
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,862
I guess Josh must've
gone through a mustache phase.

412
00:19:08,886 --> 00:19:10,932
So they weren't paying attention

when it happened.

00:19:12,238 --> 00:19:14,675
The Takers came into Fillory.

415
00:19:14,718 --> 00:19:16,155
The borderlands became overrun.

416
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:18,940
The people fled for their lives.

No one knows where
the Takers came from,

421
00:19:25,816 --> 00:19:26,904
but they were everywhere.

422
00:19:26,948 --> 00:19:28,732
The people asked for help.

423
00:19:28,776 --> 00:19:30,212
BOTH: But we didn't do anything.

424
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:31,648
The people prayed.

425
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:33,017
There were no more
gods in Fillory,

426
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,366
yet their prayers
were answered anyway.

427
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:38,089
I will save
the people of Fillory!

428
00:19:40,831 --> 00:19:43,007
Who was this mysterious hero?

429
00:19:43,051 --> 00:19:44,270
Oh, just a humble wizard

430
00:19:44,313 --> 00:19:46,446
coming to you
out of the darkness.

431
00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:49,188
Eventually,
the people would decide

432
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:53,148
to make this dark wizard
THEIR KING: The Dark King.

433
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:57,979
I promise to protect you
as long as I live,

434
00:19:58,022 --> 00:19:59,720
and I shall live forever.

Look, maybe you didn't
have time to prepare yourself

it didn't end well for them.

When did you have time
to go see "Endgame"?

Does it matter?

pick up on emotional cues.

00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,306
Look.

542
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:26,457
You're a smart dwarf, right?

543
00:25:26,481 --> 00:25:28,004
Yeah.

544
00:25:28,048 --> 00:25:30,137
There's got to be
some way to skip back.

545
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,269
I mean, this whole thing

546
00:25:32,313 --> 00:25:34,228
is already impossible, isn't it?

547
00:25:34,271 --> 00:25:35,534
Yeah.

548
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:37,405
We're sorry we
didn't bring you snacks.

549
00:25:37,448 --> 00:25:39,407
Oh, this isn't even
about the snacks.

550
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,322
If I wound the clock backward,

551
00:25:41,365 --> 00:25:43,063
it would... it would just be bad.

552
00:25:43,106 --> 00:25:45,718
How bad? 'Cause it's bad now.

553
00:25:45,761 --> 00:25:47,589
Like apocalypse bad.

554
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:49,591
It would destroy Fillory.

555
00:25:49,635 --> 00:25:51,375
So I'm sorry.

556
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:52,681
I wish I could help you.

557
00:25:54,161 --> 00:25:56,380
You guys want
some cave mushrooms?

558
00:26:00,254 --> 00:26:01,864
Look on the bright side, Bambi.

559
00:26:01,908 --> 00:26:04,519
We just got to slide up
back to the surface,

560
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,608
which hurt a lot less
than on the way down.

561
00:26:06,652 --> 00:26:09,219
And now we get
to hole up in a lovely villa

562
00:26:09,263 --> 00:26:12,005
on the Grand Canal and sip
Bellinis until we pass out.

563
00:26:12,048 --> 00:26:13,659
We can't leave Fillory.

564
00:26:13,702 --> 00:26:15,332
I don't want to tell you
that things are hopeless,

565
00:26:15,356 --> 00:26:17,271
but they're not
looking very good.

566
00:26:17,314 --> 00:26:19,621
And I hate to see
you feeling like this.

567
00:26:19,665 --> 00:26:21,754
I'm not gonna feel better.

568
00:26:22,972 --> 00:26:24,278
What the hell is wrong with you?

569
00:26:24,321 --> 00:26:25,758
You should feel just as upset.

570
00:26:25,801 --> 00:26:28,151
Uh... I don't know.

571
00:26:28,195 --> 00:26:30,153
I guess it takes
a lot to upset me.

572
00:26:30,197 --> 00:26:31,851
I think you're
gloriously medicated

573
00:26:31,894 --> 00:26:33,243
and in some textbook denial.

574
00:26:33,287 --> 00:26:35,289
I'm managing.

575
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:39,598
- I'm fine.
- Sure, you're fine.

576
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:43,079
A monster rode you around
for months

577
00:26:43,123 --> 00:26:44,646
while he murdered people,

578
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:47,562
and then one of your
closest friends died.

579
00:26:49,085 --> 00:26:53,655
You know, I don't remember
anything from in there.

580
00:26:53,699 --> 00:26:56,005
As if that
changes a goddamn thing.

581
00:26:58,094 --> 00:27:02,055
Quentin died, and it hurts.

582
00:27:02,098 --> 00:27:04,274
And I don't really
want to talk about it.

583
00:27:04,318 --> 00:27:07,190
Everything I have to say,
you already know, so...

584
00:27:07,234 --> 00:27:09,018
Why?

585
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,283
Well, if it were me,

586
00:27:13,327 --> 00:27:16,983
I'd be driving a...
Semi down fury oad.

587
00:27:18,724 --> 00:27:20,682
Yeah, well, feelings are gauche

588
00:27:20,726 --> 00:27:23,685
and I'm sparing you mine and I
thought you would be grateful.

589
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:25,948
I don't care what you're like
out there, but with me?

590
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:29,648
I thought you'd at
least try to be real.

591
00:27:30,823 --> 00:27:31,954
Bambi.

592
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:34,783
Don't "Bambi" me.

593

If you're gonna be this stupid,

594
00:27:36,393 --> 00:27:38,700
I need some time
alone to calm down.

Hey, banished scum!

596
00:28:02,768 --> 00:28:03,986
What happened here?

597
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,727
Been a rough couple of weeks.

598
00:28:05,771 --> 00:28:07,163
Everyone's abandoned us.

599
00:28:07,207 --> 00:28:09,426

604

Look, no bullshit,

605
00:28:20,394 --> 00:28:23,136
after you refused to help her
for, like, the 15th time,

606
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:25,312
I think it broke her brain.

607
00:28:25,355 --> 00:28:28,271
She said she can't be trusted
to lead and ran off.

608
00:28:28,315 --> 00:28:30,839
Then who's leading the Library?

609
00:28:30,883 --> 00:28:32,667
Well, not me, that's for sure.

610
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,408

611
00:28:36,976 --> 00:28:39,282
That's a Library

612
00:28:39,326 --> 00:28:41,304
- You know about these?
- I've heard a couple things.

613
00:28:41,328 --> 00:28:43,460
Okay, well it shows you
the location of every volume

614
00:28:43,504 --> 00:28:45,419
and how to access it.

615
00:28:46,463 --> 00:28:48,901
So what's the problem, then?

616
00:28:48,944 --> 00:28:51,817

who did this...

617
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,689
is dead.
I need you to unlock it.

about the nature of your job.

623
00:29:17,843 --> 00:29:20,082
You told me they'd get killed
if I didn't talk to them,

624
00:29:20,106 --> 00:29:22,456
so I told them
how not to get killed.

625
00:29:22,499 --> 00:29:25,067
Well, how very
thoughtful of you.

626
00:29:25,111 --> 00:29:27,156
Look, man,
I was doing you a solid,

627
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,246
but I don't think I'm your guy.

628
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:33,467

where I usually dig deep

to find a funny or sad
anecdote to win you back.

630
00:29:36,862 --> 00:29:39,299

631

Yes.

I'm afraid.

636
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:48,438
Maybe it's what
happened to Quentin.

637
00:29:48,482 --> 00:29:51,137
Maybe it's just my liver.

638
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,313
Either way,
I'm a bit raw at the moment,

639

so you will
forgive my bluntness.

640
00:29:55,837 --> 00:29:57,447
You signed a contract.

641

like, to protect me?

642
00:30:00,189 --> 00:30:02,104
I lied.

643
00:30:02,148 --> 00:30:04,106
It was an employment contract,

644
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,499
which forbids you from quitting.

00:30:10,547 --> 00:30:13,855
Well, I will sue you
into oblivion.

00:43:06,932 --> 00:43:09,108
I didn't even know
how to be alone.

901
00:43:09,151 --> 00:43:12,459
I did some pretty insane
things just to get by.

902
00:43:14,548 --> 00:43:16,724
Insane even for me,

903
00:43:16,768 --> 00:43:18,813
but I'll spare you the details.

904
00:43:18,857 --> 00:43:20,641
Doesn't sound like you.

905
00:43:20,685 --> 00:43:22,861
Well, I could
tell you if you prefer.

906
00:43:22,904 --> 00:43:25,472
What's your point, Mom?

907
00:43:25,515 --> 00:43:29,084
That everything's just
gonna get better, eventually?

908
00:43:29,128 --> 00:43:32,697
No one gets to tell
you how to grieve, Alice.

909
00:43:34,089 --> 00:43:36,875
You're on this
journey by yourself.

910
00:43:36,918 --> 00:43:40,226
Only you know where
it's gonna take you.

911
00:43:41,662 --> 00:43:45,144
If you need to do something
crazy to get through it...

912
00:43:46,711 --> 00:43:49,061
Do something crazy, okay?
