00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:10,249
ELIOT: Huh.

177
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,911
I guess these people didn't get
the memo they're living in a dystopia.

178
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,620
A fine unshackling
to you, pilgrims.

179
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:19,725
Hello.

180
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:22,695
I see you've gotten a head
start on today's festivities.

181
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,323
Right.

182
00:09:25,632 --> 00:09:28,363
I'm... I'm Pree.

183
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:33,871
And, uh, you two must
be High King Margo

184
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,966
and High King Eliot. (CHUCKLES)

185
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:39,342
Um, what? Now, guess who I am.

186
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:40,712
Come on.

187
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:47,087
High King Fen the Toeless.

188
00:09:48,054 --> 00:09:50,546
Not bad, right? They're
cosplaying as us.

189
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:54,124
Hey, so where's this
big party? ELIOT: Yeah.

190
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:56,522
You two really
have been drinking.

191
00:09:57,197 --> 00:10:00,827
There's only one place to
celebrate the Great Unshackling.

192
00:10:02,235 --> 00:10:04,363
Castle Whitespire.
Castle Whitespire.

193
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,748
ELIOT: Castle Whitespire.
Of course. Where else?

194
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,652
We want to get there before all the
good seats are gone, so come with us.

195
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,600
Come on. Come on.

196
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,975
It can't be that easy,
can it? I guess so.

STEPHANIE: Good
afternoon, Alice.

199
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,290
It is afternoon, you know.

200
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:40,005
You got another
letter from the Library.

201
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:50,273
You know, they're just gonna keep
sending them unless you respond.

203
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:53,752
I know.

204
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,152
I already told them no.

205
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,582
I'm just bad at listening.

206
00:10:59,192 --> 00:11:02,526
Alice, you know, I have no
problem with you living here.

207
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:06,357
And it is your business if
you want to let yourself go.

208
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:09,061
But right now I
need you to put on,

209
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,866
you know, whatever
fits and help me.

210
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:13,968
It's an emergency.

211
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:21,080
You want my help to cheat?

212
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:23,249
Not cheat. Pick.

213
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:27,450
It's my ladies' garden club
perennial orchid competition,

214
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:29,555
and, well, I want to win.

215
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:31,719
But none of them
are Magicians, right?

216
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,335
Yeah, but that doesn't mean

217
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,839
they're not a bunch
of mean old twats.

218
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:38,330
Mom, this is not an
emergency. Yes, it is.

219
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,500
There's too much magic, Alice.

crazy. I'll get it.

I see you have your
Umar, Kaminsky, Aurora.

227
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:17,301
See, I... I always
thought books would help.

228
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:23,938
Only problem is books make you think
you can do something that you shouldn't.

229
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:26,437
Anyone here know other
people's thoughts yet?

230
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,105
Cool.

231
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:32,276
You're gonna want to get some psychic
wards to block that shit out right now.

232
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,779
The truth? Being a
Traveler is a curse.

233
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,717
Best case scenario, you end
up a taxi service for your friends.

234
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:41,318
Worst case, you dream about
volcanoes and then you wake up in one.

235
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,130
What?

236
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:48,292
Yeah, are you actually
gonna teach us something,

237
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:50,461
or are you just gonna
keep trying to scare us?

238
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:56,241
Look, man. I'm trying
to be real with you.

239
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:57,910
You should be scared.

240
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:00,280
I mean, have you
even actually Travelled?

241
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:03,410
Anyone? (CHUCKLES)
Okay, seriously?

242
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:07,976
Get an anti-Travelling
tattoo and then just go.

243
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:09,920
Enjoy your life.

than if you stick around with this shit.

ALICE: I miss him,
too, but a seance?

248
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,732
Well, I wanted to talk to him,
and then I realized, what if I could?

249
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,554
You know, what if we could?

250
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:33,836
Actually talking to
the dead is wild magic.

251
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,380
It's way too dangerous.

252
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,144
Well, then what should I do?

253
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:41,685
Because I don't know,
and the person I want to ask

254
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:42,788
is Q.

256

to move on without him.

You got that look, boss.

That guy. He was so
afraid of not having magic,

289
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:04,868
he was willing to risk blowing
his own arm off to get it back.

That guy was an idiot.

Or maybe just desperate.

So, what? It's hard to be a
Hedge? It's always been hard.

We could at least
defend ourselves.

294
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:17,003
I thought with magic back
things would get better.

295
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,988
The Library promised they'd remove
all of Reed's Marks, and they haven't.

296
00:16:20,012 --> 00:16:21,173
Are you surprised?

I hear the Library's
falling apart,

to remove them ourselves.

valid once the place collapses.

00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:43,151
No matter who was in charge,
Fillory remained shackled to them.

348
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,856
Which brings us to these two.

349

Also, I have a mustache.

Oh.

355
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:04,742
Guess Josh must have gone
through a mustache phase.

356
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,841
So they weren't paying
attention when it happened.

357
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:10,178
The Takers came into Fillory.

358
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:11,807
The borderlands became overrun.

359
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:14,149

Takers came from, but they were everywhere.

BOTH: But we didn't do anything.

366
00:19:27,433 --> 00:19:28,833
There were no
more gods in Fillory,

367
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:30,665
yet their prayers were
answered anyway.

368

time to prepare yourself for this,

didn't end well for them.

gonna time-fix this bitch.

402
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,590
Right. So I guess we just
have to somehow find our way

403
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:32,318
to the center of the world then?

started excavations to reach it.

I just figured if you came
all that way from the surface,

434
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,230
you might have some
hearty adventuring snacks,

435

like bread and maybe ham,

436
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:03,599
and cheese and lettuce and
perhaps some assorted condiments.

want a ham sandwich.

aren't made to go backward.

forward 300 years if you want.

go another 300 years in the future?

about the snacks.

backward, it would just be bad.

her for, like, the fifteenth time,

she can't be trusted to lead and ran off.

00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,866
Then who's leading the Library?

516
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:30,336
Well, not me, that's for
sure. I'm just doing my job.

517
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,519

Branch Index, isn't it?

518
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:37,501
You know about these?
I've heard a couple things.

00:28:37,683 --> 00:28:41,586
Okay, well, it shows you the location
of every volume and how to access it.

the problem then?

who did this is dead.

I need you to unlock it.

523
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,871
If you're gonna
watch, I'll need a drink.

524
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,768
Yeah, I could use one myself.

527
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:13,544
I think there's a bit of confusion
about the nature of your job.

528
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,548
PENNY: You told me they'd
get killed if I didn't talk to them,

529
00:29:16,622 --> 00:29:19,091
so I told them how
not to get killed.

530
00:29:19,157 --> 00:29:21,217
Well, how very
thoughtful of you.

531
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:22,454
(POURING DRINK) Look, man.

532
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:25,793
I was doing you a solid,
but I don't think I'm your guy.

533
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:30,733
This is the time, as a dean, where
I usually dig deep to find a funny

534
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:32,896
or sad anecdote to win you back.

535
00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:37,743
But since I've stopped drinking,
those no longer come easy.

536
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,778
You stopped drinking? Yes.

537
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,505
I've lost the taste
for it, I'm afraid.

538
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:44,639
Maybe it's what
happened to Quentin.

539
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:46,949
Maybe it's just my liver.

540
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,645
Either way, I'm a bit
raw at the moment,

541
00:29:49,755 --> 00:29:51,417
so you will forgive
my bluntness.

542
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:53,716
You signed a contract.

543
00:29:54,926 --> 00:29:56,337
I thought that was,
like, to protect me.

544
00:29:56,361 --> 00:29:57,420
I lied.

545
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,629
It was an employment contract,
which forbids you from quitting.

546
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:04,528
I've never met a Penny
who read the fine print.

547
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,465
So what if I break it?

548
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:09,807
Well, I will sue
you into oblivion.

549
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:13,942
Could you fight it?
Yes. Would you win? No.

550
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:16,006
Could you run?

Well, yes, of course.

way he did it was creepy. (LAUGHS)

me Sir Effingham.

well, it requires a
certain kind of hero.

And what kind of
hero would that be?

from many trusted sources

yours can be cured,

was never a building here.

told me. Travelers die.
