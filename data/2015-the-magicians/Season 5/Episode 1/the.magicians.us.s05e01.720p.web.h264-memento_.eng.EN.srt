2
00:00:07,311 --> 00:00:09,400
- Previously,
on "The Magicians"...

3
00:00:09,444 --> 00:00:12,142
- You didn't just
save their lives,

4
00:00:12,186 --> 00:00:14,666
you changed their lives

5
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:17,365
as much as they changed yours.

6
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,540
You didn't want
to leave all that.

7
00:00:24,459 --> 00:00:25,634
- Pardon me, sir.

8
00:00:25,677 --> 00:00:26,809
Fillory is still ruled

9
00:00:26,852 --> 00:00:28,463
by Acting High King Fen,
right?

10
00:00:28,506 --> 00:00:30,465
- The Dark King reins.
Glory to his rule.

11
00:00:30,508 --> 00:00:32,249
High King Fen
and Josh the Fresh Prince

12
00:00:32,293 --> 00:00:34,208
were overthrown 300 years ago.

13
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:37,080
- We need you to go find
someone and do your very best

14
00:00:37,124 --> 00:00:38,647
to convince them
to come and help us.

15
00:00:39,604 --> 00:00:41,215
Alice Quinn.

16
00:00:41,258 --> 00:00:44,087
- Get a bloodworm and cast,
you boil alive.

17
00:00:44,131 --> 00:00:47,612
Reed's Mark would prevent them
from triggering the parasite.

18
00:00:47,656 --> 00:00:50,876
- And once this Serpent group
have been dealt with,

19
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,661
the mark is removed
free of charge.

20
00:00:52,704 --> 00:00:55,446
- The one that I'm the most
worried about is Julie.

21
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,187
- Thank you for deciding
that I'll never

22
00:00:57,231 --> 00:00:58,319
get to do magic again.

23
00:00:58,362 --> 00:00:59,711
- She's been in a weird place.

24
00:00:59,755 --> 00:01:04,194
And magic comes from pain.

25
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:09,721
Did you--did you just see that?
- Yeah.

26
00:01:09,765 --> 00:01:13,551
So...what are you
gonna do with it?

27
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,217
Okay.

28
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:50,762
- Julia, you, ready?

29
00:01:50,806 --> 00:01:52,677
Wow. Wow.
You look...

30
00:01:52,721 --> 00:01:55,245
- Overdressed.
- Great.

31
00:01:59,945 --> 00:02:02,165
- I thought you said
this was a date.

32
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:04,428
- I said I was taking you out
and to dress appropriately.

33
00:02:04,472 --> 00:02:05,951
- That means dress up.

34
00:02:05,995 --> 00:02:07,257
You totally told me
to dress up.

35
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:08,606
- I should've been
more specific.

36
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:09,955
- Good.

37
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:11,827
Glad to hear
you accept the blame.

38
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,829
- Only problem is, we gotta
go now or we're gonna miss it.

39
00:02:13,872 --> 00:02:15,309
Where's your coat?

40
00:02:15,352 --> 00:02:16,919
- But it's 75 degrees out.

41
00:02:16,962 --> 00:02:18,790
- Not where we're going.

42
00:02:23,665 --> 00:02:25,188
- Okay...

43
00:02:26,407 --> 00:02:28,191
- Here.

44
00:02:28,235 --> 00:02:30,367
Do you consent
to be traveled?

45
00:02:30,411 --> 00:02:32,587
- I consent to be...

46
00:02:34,763 --> 00:02:36,199
traveled.

47
00:02:36,243 --> 00:02:37,940
Where are we?

48
00:02:37,983 --> 00:02:40,899
- Other side of the planet.
Look.

49
00:02:42,249 --> 00:02:43,772
So my friend Seth is an artist,

50
00:02:43,815 --> 00:02:45,774
but there hasn't been
enough magic for him

51
00:02:45,817 --> 00:02:48,820
to work with meteors until now.

52
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:53,695
- It's incredible.

53
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:12,801
- See, there are a lot of ways
to use magic

54
00:03:12,844 --> 00:03:14,629
to make the world
a better place.

55
00:03:17,022 --> 00:03:19,590
- Wait, what?

56
00:03:22,724 --> 00:03:25,335
Is that why
you brought me here?

57
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:27,250
- No, that's not really the--

58
00:03:27,294 --> 00:03:29,600
I mean, you've been working so
hard to try to figure this out.

59
00:03:29,644 --> 00:03:31,298
- I told you.
It's my business.

60
00:03:31,341 --> 00:03:32,951
- And I'm just trying to help.

61
00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:35,302
You know, to brainstorm.

62
00:03:35,345 --> 00:03:37,956
- I need to choose that.

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,741
You understand
what that means, right?

64
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:44,267
- You feel that?

65
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:46,008
- It's another surge?

66
00:03:52,797 --> 00:03:54,843
Shit.

67
00:03:54,886 --> 00:03:56,279
- Penny.

68
00:04:09,466 --> 00:04:11,381
- How does making
pretty patterns in the sky

69
00:04:11,425 --> 00:04:13,601
help the world when this
type of a thing can happen?

70
00:04:13,644 --> 00:04:15,951
- No one knows when
a magic surge is coming.

71
00:04:15,994 --> 00:04:18,910
So what, we shouldn't try
and make things nicer?

72
00:04:18,954 --> 00:04:20,521
- The surges are getting worse.

73
00:04:20,564 --> 00:04:21,783
I'm just saying this
is the type of thing

74
00:04:21,826 --> 00:04:23,567
I should be using
my magic to fix.

75
00:04:23,611 --> 00:04:26,570
- Julia, I-I just wanted you
to have a break for one night.

76
00:04:26,614 --> 00:04:29,486
- Yeah, but this
is why I'm working.

77
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,009
I mean--

78
00:04:31,053 --> 00:04:35,100
- I only have magic
because I lost Q.

79
00:04:35,144 --> 00:04:38,278
I-I just have to find something
to do with it that...

80
00:04:39,757 --> 00:04:41,759
That's worth that.

81
00:04:41,803 --> 00:04:44,414
- Julia, there's nothing that
you will ever be able to do

82
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:46,286
that's worth losing him.

83
00:04:53,684 --> 00:04:55,338
- You know what kills me?

84
00:04:55,382 --> 00:04:57,862
I just keep thinking, like...

85
00:04:57,906 --> 00:05:01,605
"I should talk to Q.

86
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:03,912
He'd know what I should do."

87
00:05:03,955 --> 00:05:07,437
And then I think,
"Right."

88
00:05:11,485 --> 00:05:13,791
- It's only been a month.

89
00:05:13,835 --> 00:05:15,053
This kind of thing
takes a while.

90
00:05:21,886 --> 00:05:25,063
- Goddamn it.
Shit.

91
00:05:25,107 --> 00:05:27,022
My apologies.
- Dean Fogg?

92
00:05:27,065 --> 00:05:30,373
- I was waiting for
the right moment to interject

93
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:33,158
and, well, that never came.

94
00:05:33,202 --> 00:05:34,682
- Are you drunk?

95
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:36,988
- No, and I'm sorry
about the scotch.

96
00:05:37,032 --> 00:05:39,817
I was...smelling it.

97
00:05:42,429 --> 00:05:43,821
- You're not trying
to get me to go

98
00:05:43,865 --> 00:05:45,519
to Brakebills again, are you?

99
00:05:45,562 --> 00:05:47,390
- Hardly, dear.

100
00:05:47,434 --> 00:05:49,566
I accepted your refusal

101
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,829
as any gentleman should.

102
00:05:51,873 --> 00:05:54,354
Truth is,
I'm actually here for Penny.

103
00:05:57,966 --> 00:05:59,750
- Jesus Christ,
what happened here?

104
00:05:59,794 --> 00:06:03,101
- Everett drank a reservoir
of magic and exploded.

105
00:06:03,145 --> 00:06:05,495
It had to go somewhere.

106
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:07,715
Too much magic means
too many people with potential

107
00:06:07,758 --> 00:06:09,412
are discovering their gift.

108
00:06:09,456 --> 00:06:10,892
Lately, more people
have been able to pass

109
00:06:10,935 --> 00:06:12,023
than we can handle.

110
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:13,503
And now look at this place.

111
00:06:13,547 --> 00:06:16,854
Might as well be
a goddamn state school;

112
00:06:16,898 --> 00:06:19,901
overcrowded,
discipline problems.

113
00:06:19,944 --> 00:06:23,034
Did you know someone stole the
school's supply of living clay?

114
00:06:23,078 --> 00:06:24,209
- No.

115
00:06:24,253 --> 00:06:25,646
- Of course,
thanks to the surges,

116
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:26,995
a few of them have
blown themselves up,

117
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:28,649
which isn't very good
for morale, but yes,

118
00:06:28,692 --> 00:06:31,565
it helps with
the goddamn over-enrollment.

119
00:06:31,608 --> 00:06:34,524
With the rise in students
has come a simultaneous rise

120
00:06:34,568 --> 00:06:37,179
in some of
the rarer disciplines...

121
00:06:37,222 --> 00:06:39,137
like yours.

122
00:06:42,053 --> 00:06:45,492
So who better to teach them
than you?

123
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,973
- Whoa, I--I'm no professor.

124
00:06:49,017 --> 00:06:51,802
- Penny, you're the only
Brakebills-educated traveler

125
00:06:51,846 --> 00:06:53,456
currently alive on this planet,

126
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,197
which makes you far more
qualified to teach them

127
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,808
than anyone else I have,
including me.

128
00:06:57,852 --> 00:07:00,202
- Yeah, but what if one of them
gets killed because of me?

129
00:07:00,245 --> 00:07:01,986
- Excellent point.

130
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,815
This indemnifies you
against any claims,

131
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:07,035
legal or magical that
your students might make.

132
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:08,906
- That doesn't
actually solve my problem.

133
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:13,084
- Penny, I can assure you
that without your instruction,

134
00:07:13,128 --> 00:07:15,913
one of them will absolutely
get killed.

135
00:07:18,612 --> 00:07:20,570
- Fine.

136
00:07:33,844 --> 00:07:35,977
- To our pretty corpses.

137
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,153
- Goddamn gorgeous corpses.

138
00:07:38,196 --> 00:07:40,982
I'd ---- our corpses.

139
00:07:43,201 --> 00:07:45,813
What are we doing here, Eliot?

140
00:07:45,856 --> 00:07:47,597
- We're despairing in style,

141
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:49,512
as befits two former
High Kings of Fillory.

142
00:07:49,556 --> 00:07:52,254
- On that note, it's 3:00,
when I usually ask you

143
00:07:52,297 --> 00:07:54,082
if you'd like
to talk about Quentin.

144
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,301
- And I usually respond,
"I'm fine."

145
00:07:56,345 --> 00:08:00,262
With the help of some
liberally applied libations.

146
00:08:00,305 --> 00:08:03,265
I would prefer to focus on
our current hopeless situation.

147
00:08:03,308 --> 00:08:06,834
- You know, I gotta
give it to this Dark King.

148
00:08:06,877 --> 00:08:08,662
All the patrols
and heightened security

149
00:08:08,705 --> 00:08:10,925
have made it impossible
to get into his castle.

150
00:08:10,968 --> 00:08:13,928
- We tried for a week.
That seems like enough.

151
00:08:13,971 --> 00:08:16,670
- Although Dark King
is a little generic

152
00:08:16,713 --> 00:08:19,020
as villain names go,
wouldn't you say?

153
00:08:19,063 --> 00:08:20,195
- I have notes.

154
00:08:20,238 --> 00:08:21,631
- Like, we get it,
you're a despot.

155
00:08:21,675 --> 00:08:23,503
You're the ------- Dark King.

156
00:08:24,852 --> 00:08:26,723
- Although he is
somewhat effective.

157
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:29,639
Everyone seems terrified
of him, like the bunnies.

158
00:08:29,683 --> 00:08:31,815
- They did seem
unusually scared.

159
00:08:31,859 --> 00:08:33,034
- They did.

160
00:08:33,077 --> 00:08:35,340
- I hope they get
our warning to 23.

161
00:08:35,384 --> 00:08:37,908
- You know I know we
told him not to Travel here

162
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:40,650
because of time shit,
but maybe we should just

163
00:08:40,694 --> 00:08:42,739
take the Portal Tree back
to Earth and regroup?

164
00:08:42,783 --> 00:08:44,654
- I think it's not
safe to leave until

165
00:08:44,698 --> 00:08:46,351
we figure out the time shit.

166
00:08:46,395 --> 00:08:48,136
What if we go back and bam--

167
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:50,225
it's 300 years later on Earth?

168
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:53,097
If we could just figure out
a way into his castle

169
00:08:53,141 --> 00:08:55,622
and find out what
happened to Josh and Fen,

170
00:08:55,665 --> 00:08:56,971
we might be
in a better position.

171
00:08:57,014 --> 00:08:59,103
- Bambi, we're 300 years
in the future.

172
00:08:59,147 --> 00:09:01,018
All signs point to not good.

173
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:03,804
- Look,
Josh is a ------- Magician.

174
00:09:03,847 --> 00:09:06,589
Maybe he baked an
immortality cake or something.

175
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:08,852
Plus, it's Fillory.

176
00:09:08,896 --> 00:09:11,594
Weirdness abounds.

177
00:09:15,642 --> 00:09:17,034
- I guess these people
didn't get the memo

178
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:18,949
they're living in a dystopia.

179
00:09:20,647 --> 00:09:24,041
- A fine Unshackling
to you pilgrims.

180
00:09:24,085 --> 00:09:27,697
I see you've gotten a head
start on today's festivities.

181
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:33,007
- Right...
- I'm--I'm Pree.

182
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,750
And, you two must be...

183
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:40,623
High King Margo
and High King Eliot.

184
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,190
- Um, what?

185
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:44,235
- Now, guess who I am.

186
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,715
Come on.

187
00:09:49,371 --> 00:09:52,896
High King Fen the Toeless.

188
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,984
Not bad, right?

189
00:09:54,028 --> 00:09:55,333
- They're cosplaying as us.

190
00:09:55,377 --> 00:09:57,988
- Hey, so where's
this big party?

191
00:09:58,032 --> 00:09:59,250
- Yeah.

192
00:09:59,294 --> 00:10:01,339
- You two really
have been drinking.

193
00:10:01,383 --> 00:10:03,254
There's only one place

194
00:10:03,298 --> 00:10:06,170
to celebrate
the Great Unshackling.

195
00:10:06,214 --> 00:10:08,042
Castle Whitespire!

196
00:10:08,085 --> 00:10:09,391
both:
Castle Whitespire.

197
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:10,740
- Of course, where else?

198
00:10:10,784 --> 00:10:11,741
- We wanna get there before

199
00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:12,742
all the good seats are gone,

200
00:10:12,786 --> 00:10:13,917
so come with us.
Come on.

201
00:10:13,961 --> 00:10:15,179
- Come on.

202
00:10:15,223 --> 00:10:16,746
- It can't be
that easy, can it?

203
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,226
- I guess so.

204
00:10:32,283 --> 00:10:34,982
- Good afternoon, Alice.

205
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:38,986
It is afternoon, you know.

206
00:10:40,857 --> 00:10:44,992
You got another letter
from the Library.

207
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:50,127
You know...

208
00:10:50,171 --> 00:10:52,695
they're just gonna
keep sending them

209
00:10:52,739 --> 00:10:55,219
unless you respond.

210
00:10:57,265 --> 00:10:59,920
- I know,
I already told them no.

211
00:10:59,963 --> 00:11:02,705
They're just bad at listening.

212
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:07,405
- Alice, you know I have no
problem with you living here,

213
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:11,235
and it is your business
if you want to let yourself go,

214
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,890
but right now
I need you to put on...

215
00:11:13,934 --> 00:11:15,457
you know, whatever fits

216
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,893
and help me.

217
00:11:16,937 --> 00:11:19,026
It's an emergency.

218
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,946
- You want my help to cheat?

219
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:28,165
- Not cheat, pick.

220
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:31,865
It's my ladies' garden club
perennial orchid competition,

221
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:34,389
and, well, I wanna win.

222
00:11:34,432 --> 00:11:36,739
- But none of them
are Magicians, right?

223
00:11:36,783 --> 00:11:38,088
- Yeah, but that
doesn't mean they're not

224
00:11:38,132 --> 00:11:39,524
a bunch of mean old twats.

225
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:41,744
- Mom, this is not
an emergency.

226
00:11:41,788 --> 00:11:45,182
- Yes it is.
There's too much magic, Alice.

227
00:11:45,226 --> 00:11:47,271
Everything that I touch
just...

228
00:11:47,315 --> 00:11:48,533
It grows like crazy.

229
00:11:48,577 --> 00:11:50,840
- I'll get it.

230
00:11:58,065 --> 00:12:00,023
- Hey, can I come in?

231
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:11,426
- Welcome to Introductory
Psychic Translocation.

232
00:12:11,469 --> 00:12:13,689
My name is Professor Adiyodi.

233
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:17,867
I see you have your
Umar, Kaminsky, Aurora...

234
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:22,829
See, I always thought
books would help, but...

235
00:12:24,482 --> 00:12:26,528
The only problem is,
books make you think

236
00:12:26,571 --> 00:12:28,617
you can do something
that you shouldn't.

237
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,750
Anyone hearing other
people's thoughts yet?

238
00:12:31,881 --> 00:12:34,710
Cool, you're gonna wanna
get some psychic wards

239
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,712
to block that
shit out right now.

240
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,801
The truth?
Being a traveler is a curse.

241
00:12:38,845 --> 00:12:40,324
Best case scenario?

242
00:12:40,368 --> 00:12:41,804
You end up a taxi service
for your friends.

243
00:12:41,848 --> 00:12:42,979
Worst case?

244
00:12:43,023 --> 00:12:44,285
You dream about volcanoes,

245
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:45,765
and then you wake up in one.

246
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,551
What?

247
00:12:49,594 --> 00:12:50,813
- Yeah,

248
00:12:50,857 --> 00:12:52,684
are you actually
gonna teach us something

249
00:12:52,728 --> 00:12:55,557
or are you just gonna
keep trying to scare us?

250
00:12:57,689 --> 00:12:58,778
- Look, man,

251
00:12:58,821 --> 00:13:00,649
I'm trying to be real
with you.

252
00:13:00,692 --> 00:13:02,346
You should be scared.

253
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,653
I mean, have you even
actually traveled?

254
00:13:04,696 --> 00:13:06,307
Anyone?

255
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,613
Okay...seriously,

256
00:13:08,657 --> 00:13:10,267
get an anti-traveling tattoo

257
00:13:10,311 --> 00:13:12,748
and then just go.

258
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,402
Enjoy your life.

259
00:13:14,445 --> 00:13:15,838
'Cause it'd be
a hell of a lot longer

260
00:13:15,882 --> 00:13:17,884
than if you stick around
with this shit.

261
00:13:17,927 --> 00:13:19,407
End of class.

262
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,582
Peace.

263
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,370
- I miss him too,
but

264
00:13:26,414 --> 00:13:27,850
a séance?

265
00:13:27,894 --> 00:13:29,634
- Well, I wanted
to talk to him,

266
00:13:29,678 --> 00:13:30,940
and then I realized

267
00:13:30,984 --> 00:13:32,681
what if I could?

268
00:13:32,724 --> 00:13:33,638
You know, what if we could?

269
00:13:34,988 --> 00:13:38,774
- Actually talking
to the dead is wild magic.

270
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,776
It's way too dangerous.

271
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,647
- Well, then what should I do?

272
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:45,041
Because I don't know, and
the person I wanna ask...

273
00:13:45,085 --> 00:13:47,348
is Q.

274
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,832
- I miss him every day too.

275
00:13:54,616 --> 00:13:57,749
I honestly don't know
how to move on without him.

276
00:13:57,793 --> 00:13:59,969
I just--but we have to, right?

277
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,472
- I found it.

278
00:14:24,515 --> 00:14:26,039
It was his.

279
00:14:30,043 --> 00:14:32,349
- His notes are
written in the margin.

280
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:40,967
- What a nerd.

281
00:14:45,841 --> 00:14:49,497
- Can't talk to him,
but...can read it.

282
00:14:51,716 --> 00:14:53,849
Picture what he was thinking.

283
00:14:55,851 --> 00:14:58,549
Next best thing.

284
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:06,688
- Um...

285
00:15:06,731 --> 00:15:07,907
is Kady here?

286
00:15:10,126 --> 00:15:11,823
- Let me get this straight.

287
00:15:11,867 --> 00:15:14,087
Your friend tried
to remove your Reed's Mark

288
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,827
with magic, and...

289
00:15:15,871 --> 00:15:17,829
Blew my arm off, yeah.

290
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:18,961
- I still can't cast, either.

291
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:20,876
- Why not go to a hospital?

292
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,138
- I don't have
health insurance.

293
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:26,012
- I know a spell.

294
00:15:26,055 --> 00:15:27,143
Might make you vomit, though.

295
00:15:27,187 --> 00:15:28,710
- Like a lot?

296
00:15:28,753 --> 00:15:29,711
- One-armed beggars

297
00:15:29,754 --> 00:15:31,408
can't be one-arm choosers.

298
00:15:41,592 --> 00:15:43,029
- Hold his arm in place.

299
00:15:43,072 --> 00:15:45,857
- Wait, wait, wait--
how much throw-up, really?

300
00:15:50,775 --> 00:15:53,126
Wow, thank--

301
00:16:01,264 --> 00:16:02,787
You got that look, boss.

302
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:04,006
- That guy...

303
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,574
he was so afraid
of not having magic,

304
00:16:06,617 --> 00:16:07,879
he was willing to risk

305
00:16:07,923 --> 00:16:09,185
blowing his own arm off
to get it back.

306
00:16:09,229 --> 00:16:11,231
- That guy was an idiot.

307
00:16:11,274 --> 00:16:13,755
- Or maybe just desperate.

308
00:16:13,798 --> 00:16:15,887
- So what?
It's hard to be a Hedge?

309
00:16:15,931 --> 00:16:17,063
It's always been hard.

310
00:16:17,106 --> 00:16:18,934
- We could at least
defend ourselves.

311
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,502
I thought with magic back,
things would get better.

312
00:16:21,545 --> 00:16:23,069
The Library promised they'd
remove all of Reed's Marks,

313
00:16:23,112 --> 00:16:24,592
and they haven't.

314
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:25,854
- Are you surprised?

315
00:16:25,897 --> 00:16:28,596
I hear the Library's
falling apart.

316
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,599
So I doubt that
fixing hedge witches

317
00:16:31,642 --> 00:16:33,601
ranks high on their to-do list.

318
00:16:33,644 --> 00:16:35,820
- Well, I'm done waiting.

319
00:16:35,864 --> 00:16:37,648
There's tons of magic now,

320
00:16:37,692 --> 00:16:40,608
so let's figure out a way
to remove them ourselves.

321
00:16:40,651 --> 00:16:42,784
- If you're serious,

322
00:16:42,827 --> 00:16:45,569
I heard about a guy
who might be able to help.

323
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:49,225
- An Order of the Library
of the Neitherlands

324
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:51,793
medical manual should have
the ritual you're looking for.

325
00:16:51,836 --> 00:16:53,577
- And why should we trust you?

326
00:16:53,621 --> 00:16:55,623
- 'Cause I don't give
a rat's tit about the Library.

327
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,233
Never have.

328
00:16:57,277 --> 00:16:59,018
I don't even read books.

329
00:17:00,193 --> 00:17:02,499
- But you worked for them.
- Not anymore.

330
00:17:02,543 --> 00:17:04,893
Contracts aren't valid
once the place collapses.

331
00:17:04,936 --> 00:17:08,636
Besides, I'm chaotic neutral,

332
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:10,203
so I do a lot
of crazy shit...

333
00:17:10,246 --> 00:17:12,814
for cash.

334
00:17:12,857 --> 00:17:14,120
And since we're not
here to ---- spiders,

335
00:17:14,163 --> 00:17:15,643
you can pay, can't you?

336
00:17:15,686 --> 00:17:16,992
- We can pay.

337
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,646
- How soon can you
get us the manual?

338
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:20,648
I'm not getting it for you.

339
00:17:20,691 --> 00:17:22,258
I'll just tell you
where you can find it.

340
00:17:22,302 --> 00:17:25,000
A former Library book
depository no one's hit yet.

341
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,828
They'll have one...

342
00:17:26,871 --> 00:17:28,699
and a lot
more goodies, besides.

343
00:17:28,743 --> 00:17:31,659
- And you're not grabbing these
goodies for yourself, why?

344
00:17:31,702 --> 00:17:33,835
- Mate, if I knew
how to rob that place

345
00:17:33,878 --> 00:17:36,533
without getting decapitated,
I'd be robbing it right now.

346
00:17:39,797 --> 00:17:41,277
- You have all come to hear

347
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:43,149
the story of
the Great Unshackling.

348
00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:46,848
First, there was I,
Ember, God of Fillory.

349
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:49,155
Then came my boring
brother, Umber.

350
00:17:49,198 --> 00:17:52,288
Together we created this world.

351
00:17:58,207 --> 00:18:00,688
But I thought it would
be funny if Fillory

352
00:18:00,731 --> 00:18:02,646
were ruled by
Children of Earth.

353
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,648
- I am High King Eliot,

354
00:18:04,692 --> 00:18:07,173
and I am drunk all the time.

355
00:18:07,216 --> 00:18:08,739
That's original.

356
00:18:08,783 --> 00:18:10,741
- I am High King Margo,

357
00:18:10,785 --> 00:18:13,004
and I'm angry all the time.

358
00:18:13,048 --> 00:18:14,919
I am King Quentin,

359
00:18:14,963 --> 00:18:17,618
and I am dissatisfied
all the time.

360
00:18:17,661 --> 00:18:19,359
- I am Queen Alice,

361
00:18:19,402 --> 00:18:21,317
and I died,

362
00:18:21,361 --> 00:18:22,884
sort of.

363
00:18:22,927 --> 00:18:24,712
It's complicated.

364
00:18:24,755 --> 00:18:26,714
- The Children of Earth
came and went doing

365
00:18:26,757 --> 00:18:28,194
their Children of Earth things,

366
00:18:28,237 --> 00:18:31,153
like chewing loudly
and texting.

367
00:18:31,197 --> 00:18:33,199
One of them even killed me,

368
00:18:33,242 --> 00:18:35,157
which was not funny,

369
00:18:35,201 --> 00:18:37,855
but at least it was unexpected.

370
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:42,077
- He neglected to mention he
was gonna destroy the world.

371
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,165
- True that.
- Shh!

372
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:45,124
- No matter who was in charge,

373
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:47,387
Fillory remained
shackled to them,

374
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,171
which brings us to...

375
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,259
these two.

376
00:18:53,175 --> 00:18:56,178
- I am High King Fen
the Toeless,

377
00:18:56,222 --> 00:18:57,919
and I like knives.

378
00:18:57,962 --> 00:19:01,096
- I am Josh the Fresh Prince,

379
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,664
and I love to eat.

380
00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:05,753
Also I have a mustache.

381
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,843
I guess Josh must've
gone through a mustache phase.

382
00:19:08,886 --> 00:19:10,932
- So they weren't paying
attention

383
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,194
when it happened.

384
00:19:12,238 --> 00:19:14,675
The Takers came into Fillory.

385
00:19:14,718 --> 00:19:16,155
the borderlands
became overrun.

386
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:18,940
The people fled
for their lives.

387
00:19:18,983 --> 00:19:20,420
Boo!

388
00:19:20,463 --> 00:19:22,117
- Boo.

389
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,075
What's a Taker?
- I don't know.

390
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:25,773
- No one knows where
the Takers came from,

391
00:19:25,816 --> 00:19:26,904
but they were everywhere.

392
00:19:26,948 --> 00:19:28,732
The people asked for help.

393
00:19:28,776 --> 00:19:30,212
both:
But we didn't do anything.

394
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:31,648
- The people prayed.

395
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:32,997
There were no more
gods in Fillory,

396
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,347
yet their prayers
were answered anyway.

397
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:38,089
- I will save
the people of Fillory!

398
00:19:40,831 --> 00:19:43,007
- Who was this mysterious hero?

399
00:19:43,051 --> 00:19:44,270
- Just a humble wizard

400
00:19:44,313 --> 00:19:46,446
coming to you
out of the darkness.

401
00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:49,188
- Eventually,
the people would decide

402
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:53,148
to make this dark wizard
their king: the Dark King.

403
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:57,979
- I promise to protect you
as long as I live,

404
00:19:58,022 --> 00:19:59,720
and I shall live forever.

405
00:19:59,763 --> 00:20:01,678
- But before this could happen,

406
00:20:01,722 --> 00:20:04,768
the people handed out
just desserts!

407
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,423
- To the gallows!

408
00:20:12,994 --> 00:20:14,865
- Did somebody say "dessert"?

409
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:27,226
- As we cast off
the shackles of our past,

410
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:31,273
I declare today will be known
hence as the Great Unshackling.

411
00:20:31,317 --> 00:20:35,495
- And the people of Fillory
lived happily ever after.

412
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:48,290
- Margo, for God's sake,

413
00:20:48,334 --> 00:20:49,378
would you just come back?

414
00:20:49,422 --> 00:20:50,945
- They murdered them!

415
00:20:50,988 --> 00:20:52,120
They murdered
the shit out of them.

416
00:20:52,163 --> 00:20:53,339
- Okay, yeah, like

417
00:20:53,382 --> 00:20:55,515
300 years ago, all right?

418
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:58,909
Look, maybe you didn't
have time to prepare yourself

419
00:20:58,953 --> 00:21:02,086
for this, but you have to know
it didn't end well for them.

420
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:04,741
- Yeah, well,
it's not over yet.

421
00:21:04,785 --> 00:21:07,440
We're gonna
"Endgame" this shit.

422
00:21:07,483 --> 00:21:10,051
- When did you have time
to go see "Endgame"?

423
00:21:10,094 --> 00:21:11,313
- Does it matter?

424
00:21:11,357 --> 00:21:12,488
All I'm saying is

425
00:21:12,532 --> 00:21:13,881
we're gonna
time-fix this bitch.

426
00:21:13,924 --> 00:21:15,274
In the center of Fillory

427
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:17,276
is a clockwork heart
built by dwarves.

428
00:21:18,538 --> 00:21:20,191
They're the ones
who taught Jane Chatwin

429
00:21:20,235 --> 00:21:21,889
how to do Time Magic.

430
00:21:21,932 --> 00:21:23,369
Jesus Helena Bonham Christ.

431
00:21:23,412 --> 00:21:24,892
Read the books already, El.

432
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,373
We're gonna dial back the clock

433
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:29,984
300 years to before
all this bullshit.

434
00:21:31,507 --> 00:21:34,467
- Right, so I guess we just
have to somehow find our way

435
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:36,817
to the center
of the world, then?

436
00:21:37,861 --> 00:21:39,167
- When I was High King,

437
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,343
I started
excavations to reach it.

438
00:21:41,387 --> 00:21:43,998
I wanted to meet
the Clock Dwarf.

439
00:21:44,825 --> 00:21:47,131
Who takes care
of the clockwork heart?

440
00:21:47,175 --> 00:21:49,917
Come on.

441
00:22:17,553 --> 00:22:20,208
- So we're actually
going to slide

442
00:22:20,251 --> 00:22:21,992
to the center of the world?

443
00:22:22,036 --> 00:22:23,516
- Grow a ----, will you?

444
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:25,561
- Bitch, I would if I could.

445
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,502
- So what made you
change your mind?

446
00:22:54,503 --> 00:22:57,158
- I need to get out
of the house, and your request

447
00:22:57,201 --> 00:22:58,464
seemed the least annoying.

448
00:22:59,682 --> 00:23:01,989
You promise you won't
ask me to join the Library?

449
00:23:02,032 --> 00:23:03,207
- Promise.

450
00:23:03,251 --> 00:23:04,992
I just need
a phosphoromancer

451
00:23:05,035 --> 00:23:07,124
for, like, an afternoon.

452
00:23:07,168 --> 00:23:08,865
- Fine.

453
00:23:19,223 --> 00:23:20,486
- Mother------.

454
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:22,923
I have a serious case
of slide-ass.

455
00:23:22,966 --> 00:23:24,315
- Yeah.

456
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:25,882
I think I lost
several pounds

457
00:23:25,926 --> 00:23:28,102
to friction burn as well.

458
00:23:28,145 --> 00:23:31,235
- Welcome, adventurers!

459
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:33,281
- Wait, you're the Clock Dwarf?

460
00:23:33,324 --> 00:23:35,457
- I thought
you'd be smaller.

461
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:38,504
- 'Cause I deal with clocks?

462
00:23:38,547 --> 00:23:42,029
- 'Cause on Earth,
"dwarf" means "small."

463
00:23:42,072 --> 00:23:43,378
- Really?

464
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,119
Is Earth really big?

465
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:49,384
So tell me, did you happen
to bring any food with you?

466
00:23:50,951 --> 00:23:52,169
were we supposed to
bring you some food?

467
00:23:52,213 --> 00:23:54,041
- I mean,
you didn't have to.

468
00:23:54,084 --> 00:23:56,304
I just figured if you came
all that way from the surface,

469
00:23:56,347 --> 00:23:59,438
you might have some hearty,
adventuring snacks.

470
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:00,656
Like bread and

471
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,181
maybe ham and cheese
and lettuce

472
00:24:04,225 --> 00:24:08,229
and perhaps some
assorted condiments.

473
00:24:08,272 --> 00:24:10,231
- Sounds like you want
a ham sandwich.

474
00:24:10,274 --> 00:24:12,929
- If you're offering
a ham sandwich.

475
00:24:12,973 --> 00:24:14,453
- I'm not.

476
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:16,498
- I see.

477
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:18,544
It's just...

478
00:24:18,587 --> 00:24:22,156
I don't get out much on account
of the massive disruptions

479
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:25,681
in the flow of time
that happens when I do.

480
00:24:25,725 --> 00:24:28,423
I get by on

481
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,425
cave mushrooms.

482
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,122
They're fine.

483
00:24:32,645 --> 00:24:34,255
- Um...

484
00:24:34,298 --> 00:24:36,605
we were hoping you
might be able to help us.

485
00:24:36,649 --> 00:24:39,260
Earth and Fillory
kind of fell out of sync.

486
00:24:39,303 --> 00:24:41,392
On Earth,
barely any time has passed,

487
00:24:41,436 --> 00:24:44,613
while here,
it's been 300 years.

488
00:24:44,657 --> 00:24:49,096
- Big ol' surge of magic
skipped the gears forward.

489
00:24:49,139 --> 00:24:52,273
I had to crank down on it
before it went too far.

490
00:24:52,316 --> 00:24:55,319
- Okay, how about you just
wind it back 300 years, then?

491
00:24:55,363 --> 00:24:56,756
- I can't.

492
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,585
These clock gears
aren't made to go backward.

493
00:24:59,628 --> 00:25:03,589
I could probably jump you
forward 300 years, if you want?

494
00:25:03,632 --> 00:25:05,155
- Why the shit would we wanna

495
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:06,679
go another 300 years
in the future?

496
00:25:06,722 --> 00:25:09,029
- Well why would you wanna
go 300 years in the past?

497
00:25:09,072 --> 00:25:11,553
- Because all our friends are
dead and the world is ------.

498
00:25:11,597 --> 00:25:13,555
- Wow...

499
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:15,601
sorry.

500
00:25:15,644 --> 00:25:18,560
These mushrooms--
they also get me high,

501
00:25:18,604 --> 00:25:21,998
and so I don't always
pick up on emotional cues.

502
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,306
- Look.

503
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:26,437
You're a smart dwarf,
right?

504
00:25:26,481 --> 00:25:28,004
- Yeah.

505
00:25:28,048 --> 00:25:30,137
- There's gotta be
some way to skip back.

506
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,269
I mean, this whole thing

507
00:25:32,313 --> 00:25:34,228
is already
impossible, isn't it?

508
00:25:34,271 --> 00:25:35,534
- Yeah.

509
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:37,405
- We're sorry we
didn't bring you snacks.

510
00:25:37,448 --> 00:25:39,407
- This isn't even
about the snacks.

511
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:41,322
If I wound the clock backward,

512
00:25:41,365 --> 00:25:43,063
it would--
it would just be bad.

513
00:25:43,106 --> 00:25:45,718
- How bad?
'Cause it's bad now.

514
00:25:45,761 --> 00:25:47,589
- Like apocalypse bad.

515
00:25:47,633 --> 00:25:49,591
It would destroy Fillory.

516
00:25:49,635 --> 00:25:51,375
So I'm sorry.

517
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:52,681
I wish I could help you.

518
00:25:54,161 --> 00:25:56,380
You guys want
some cave mushrooms?

519
00:26:00,254 --> 00:26:01,864
- Look on the bright side,
Bambi.

520
00:26:01,908 --> 00:26:04,519
We just got to slide up
back to the surface,

521
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,608
which hurt a lot less
than on the way down.

522
00:26:06,652 --> 00:26:09,219
And now we get
to hole up in a lovely villa

523
00:26:09,263 --> 00:26:12,005
on the Grand Canal and sip
Bellinis until we pass out.

524
00:26:12,048 --> 00:26:13,659
- We can't leave Fillory.

525
00:26:13,702 --> 00:26:15,312
- I don't want to tell you
that things are hopeless,

526
00:26:15,356 --> 00:26:17,271
but they're not
looking very good.

527
00:26:17,314 --> 00:26:19,621
And I hate to see
you feeling like this.

528
00:26:19,665 --> 00:26:21,754
- I'm not gonna feel better.

529
00:26:22,972 --> 00:26:24,278
What the hell
is wrong with you?

530
00:26:24,321 --> 00:26:25,758
You should feel
just as upset.

531
00:26:25,801 --> 00:26:28,151
- ...I don't know.

532
00:26:28,195 --> 00:26:30,153
I guess it takes
a lot to upset me.

533
00:26:30,197 --> 00:26:31,851
- I think you're
gloriously medicated

534
00:26:31,894 --> 00:26:33,243
and in some textbook denial.

535
00:26:33,287 --> 00:26:35,289
- I'm managing.

536
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:39,598
I'm fine.
- Sure, you're fine.

537
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:43,079
A monster rode you around
for months

538
00:26:43,123 --> 00:26:44,646
while he murdered people,

539
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:47,562
and then one of your
closest friends died.

540
00:26:49,085 --> 00:26:53,655
- You know, I don't remember
anything from in there.

541
00:26:53,699 --> 00:26:56,005
- As if that
changes a goddamn thing.

542
00:26:58,094 --> 00:27:02,055
- Quentin died, and it hurts.

543
00:27:02,098 --> 00:27:04,274
And I don't really
want to talk about it.

544
00:27:04,318 --> 00:27:07,190
Everything I have to say,
you already know, so...

545
00:27:07,234 --> 00:27:09,018
Why?

546
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,283
- Well, if it were me,

547
00:27:13,327 --> 00:27:16,983
I'd be driving a -------
semi down fury oad.

548
00:27:18,724 --> 00:27:20,682
- Yeah, well,
feelings are gauche

549
00:27:20,726 --> 00:27:23,685
and I'm sparing you mine and I
thought you would be grateful.

550
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:25,948
- I don't care what you're like
out there, but with me?

551
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:29,648
I thought you'd at
least try to be real.

552
00:27:30,823 --> 00:27:31,954
- Bambi.

553
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:34,783
- Don't "Bambi" me.

554
00:27:34,827 --> 00:27:36,350
If you're gonna be this stupid,

555
00:27:36,393 --> 00:27:38,700
I need some time
alone to calm down.

556
00:27:55,761 --> 00:27:57,806
- Hey, banished scum!

557
00:28:02,768 --> 00:28:03,986
- What happened here?

558
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,727
- Been a rough couple of weeks.

559
00:28:05,771 --> 00:28:07,163
Everyone's abandoned us.

560
00:28:07,207 --> 00:28:09,426
We've lost most
of the branches.

561
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,951
Can't even reach our people
in the underworld.

562
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,911
- Where's Zelda?

563
00:28:15,955 --> 00:28:17,434
- God, who knows?

564
00:28:17,478 --> 00:28:18,784
She's a mess.

565
00:28:18,827 --> 00:28:20,350
Look, no bullshit,

566
00:28:20,394 --> 00:28:23,136
after you refused to help her
for, like, the 15th time,

567
00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:25,312
I think it broke her brain.

568
00:28:25,355 --> 00:28:28,271
She said she can't be trusted
to lead and ran off.

569
00:28:28,315 --> 00:28:30,839
- Then who's leading
the Library?

570
00:28:30,883 --> 00:28:32,667
- Well, not me,
that's for sure.

571
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:34,408
I'm just doing my job.

572
00:28:36,976 --> 00:28:39,282
- That's a Library
Branch Index, isn't it?

573
00:28:39,326 --> 00:28:41,284
- You know about these?
- I've heard a couple things.

574
00:28:41,328 --> 00:28:43,460
- Okay, well it shows you
the location of every volume

575
00:28:43,504 --> 00:28:45,419
and how to access it.

576
00:28:46,463 --> 00:28:48,901
- So what's the problem, then?

577
00:28:48,944 --> 00:28:51,817
- The phosphoromancer
who did this...

578
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,689
is dead.
I need you to unlock it.

579
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:03,829
- If you're gonna watch,
I'll need a drink.

580
00:29:05,831 --> 00:29:08,398
- Yeah, I could use one myself.

581
00:29:13,403 --> 00:29:15,275
- I think there's
a bit of confusion

582
00:29:15,318 --> 00:29:17,799
about the nature of your job.

583
00:29:17,843 --> 00:29:20,062
- You told me they'd get killed
if I didn't talk to them,

584
00:29:20,106 --> 00:29:22,456
so I told them
how not to get killed.

585
00:29:22,499 --> 00:29:25,067
- Well, how very
thoughtful of you.

586
00:29:25,111 --> 00:29:27,156
- Look, man,
I was doing you a solid,

587
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,246
but I don't think
I'm your guy.

588
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:33,467
- This is the time, as a dean,
where I usually dig deep

589
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:36,818
to find a funny or sad
anecdote to win you back.

590
00:29:36,862 --> 00:29:39,299
But since
I've stopped drinking,

591
00:29:39,342 --> 00:29:41,431
those no longer come easy.

592
00:29:41,475 --> 00:29:42,781
- You stopped drinking?

593
00:29:42,824 --> 00:29:43,782
- Yes.

594
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:45,000
I've lost the taste for it,

595
00:29:45,044 --> 00:29:46,785
I'm afraid.

596
00:29:46,828 --> 00:29:48,438
Maybe it's what
happened to Quentin.

597
00:29:48,482 --> 00:29:51,137
Maybe it's just my liver.

598
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,313
Either way,
I'm a bit raw at the moment,

599
00:29:53,356 --> 00:29:55,794
so you will
forgive my bluntness.

600
00:29:55,837 --> 00:29:57,447
You signed a contract.

601
00:29:57,491 --> 00:30:00,146
- I thought that was,
like, to protect me?

602
00:30:00,189 --> 00:30:02,104
- I lied.

603
00:30:02,148 --> 00:30:04,106
It was an employment contract,

604
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,499
which forbids
you from quitting.

605
00:30:05,542 --> 00:30:08,458
I've never met a Penny
who read the fine print.

606
00:30:08,502 --> 00:30:10,504
- So what if I break it?

607
00:30:10,547 --> 00:30:13,855
- Well, I will sue you
into oblivion.

608
00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:15,944
Could you fight it?
Yes.

609
00:30:15,988 --> 00:30:17,859
Would you win?
No.

610
00:30:17,903 --> 00:30:19,905
Could you run?

611
00:30:19,948 --> 00:30:21,907
Well, yes, of course.

612
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,212
You're a traveler.

613
00:30:23,256 --> 00:30:25,867
But I doubt
a world exists where you could

614
00:30:25,911 --> 00:30:28,043
hide from our lawyers.

615
00:30:28,087 --> 00:30:31,438
I will see you
at school, Professor.

616
00:30:34,223 --> 00:30:37,270
- Not that there's anything
wrong with masturbation.

617
00:30:37,313 --> 00:30:40,316
There's a tradition
of librarians masturbating--

618
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,014
it goes back centuries.

619
00:30:42,057 --> 00:30:44,886
But just the way he did it
was creepy.

620
00:30:49,412 --> 00:30:52,938
God damn.
I need to pee.

621
00:31:54,086 --> 00:31:55,870
- Holy shit.

622
00:31:57,437 --> 00:32:00,092
Apologies, my good lady,

623
00:32:00,135 --> 00:32:02,094
for the intrusion
into your maison.

624
00:32:02,137 --> 00:32:04,444
And for startling you.

625
00:32:04,487 --> 00:32:06,576
And for raiding your

626
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,970
magical winter box
of comestibles.

627
00:32:09,014 --> 00:32:12,147
It has been a long
and arduous journey...

628
00:32:12,191 --> 00:32:13,670
- Fine.

629
00:32:13,714 --> 00:32:15,150
Who are you?

630
00:32:15,194 --> 00:32:17,979
- I am Sir Hargreave
Mcgrubney Cubbins

631
00:32:18,023 --> 00:32:20,112
Archibald Brian
Effingham III,

632
00:32:20,155 --> 00:32:22,462
but you can call me
Sir Effingham.

633
00:32:26,335 --> 00:32:28,033
- Are you from Fillory?

634
00:32:28,076 --> 00:32:29,948
- Why, yes I am.

635
00:32:29,991 --> 00:32:31,601
Well deduced.

636
00:32:31,645 --> 00:32:34,082
You are a credit to your sex.

637
00:32:34,126 --> 00:32:35,257
- No.

638
00:32:35,301 --> 00:32:37,259
We've passed that.

639
00:32:37,303 --> 00:32:39,261
What brings you here to Earth?

640
00:32:39,305 --> 00:32:42,917
- I am here on a mission
of dreadful import.

641
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,572
It is not an exaggeration
to say that the very fate

642
00:32:45,615 --> 00:32:48,662
of both of our worlds
lies in the balance.

643
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:51,447
- You're here
to bestow a quest.

644
00:32:51,491 --> 00:32:54,015
- I am here to bestow a quest.

645
00:32:55,495 --> 00:32:58,541
- You know,
this timing is perfect

646
00:32:58,585 --> 00:33:00,021
because honestly,

647
00:33:00,065 --> 00:33:01,370
I've been feeling
a little lost lately

648
00:33:01,414 --> 00:33:04,199
and I've been looking
for something to do

649
00:33:04,243 --> 00:33:06,201
with my magic
to make a difference.

650
00:33:06,245 --> 00:33:08,464
You know, searching for a sign.

651
00:33:08,508 --> 00:33:10,510
And here you are.

652
00:33:10,553 --> 00:33:12,207
- Here I am.

653
00:33:12,251 --> 00:33:14,079
- So tell me,
how can I help you?

654
00:33:14,122 --> 00:33:17,560
- You can help me find
Quentin Coldwater.

655
00:33:25,742 --> 00:33:28,093
- Um...no, that's not...

656
00:33:29,442 --> 00:33:32,097
- Perhaps you have
been beset by hysteria?

657
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:34,534
Is your corset too tight?

658
00:33:34,577 --> 00:33:36,623
It can cause
the womb to wander.

659
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:38,016
I've seen it happen.

660
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:40,409
- Um, no, you--

661
00:33:40,453 --> 00:33:41,410
you can't talk to Quentin

662
00:33:41,454 --> 00:33:42,542
because he--

663
00:33:42,585 --> 00:33:43,673
he's dead.

664
00:33:43,717 --> 00:33:44,674
He died.

665
00:33:44,718 --> 00:33:47,155
- Dear.

666
00:33:47,199 --> 00:33:49,549
Dear, dear, dear.

667
00:33:51,986 --> 00:33:54,075
I do believe I'm having
the hog sweats.

668
00:33:55,772 --> 00:33:57,426
- Are you all right?

669
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,515
- No, my dear lady,
I do not believe that I am.

670
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:02,562
You see, this matter
that brings me here

671
00:34:02,605 --> 00:34:05,913
it--it is somewhat
apocalyptic in nature.

672
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,570
I find that I do
not feel at all well.

673
00:34:10,613 --> 00:34:12,572
Perhaps you could
pour me a draft

674
00:34:12,615 --> 00:34:14,052
of medicinal cocaine?

675
00:34:14,095 --> 00:34:16,924
- Yeah,
that's not a thing we use--

676
00:34:16,967 --> 00:34:18,708
- Do you not have modern
medicine in this

677
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,493
gods-forsaken world?

678
00:34:20,536 --> 00:34:22,190
This is truly
the end times.

679
00:34:23,887 --> 00:34:25,759
- Well, maybe I could
help you to save the world.

680
00:34:27,804 --> 00:34:30,111
Yes, very good.

681
00:34:30,155 --> 00:34:32,070
You're serious.

682
00:34:32,113 --> 00:34:33,897
No, no, no, you see,

683
00:34:33,941 --> 00:34:35,073
I'm afraid that that would be,

684
00:34:35,116 --> 00:34:37,640
far too difficult for--

685
00:34:37,684 --> 00:34:39,555
for someone like you
to handle.

686
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,992
- You know,
I have saved the world before.

687
00:34:42,036 --> 00:34:43,951
I was an actual Goddess.

688
00:34:43,994 --> 00:34:45,692
- And you are still
quite fetching,

689
00:34:45,735 --> 00:34:46,954
albeit unmarried.

690
00:34:46,997 --> 00:34:49,261
Look, the nature
of the quest

691
00:34:49,304 --> 00:34:50,871
that I must deliver, well, it--

692
00:34:50,914 --> 00:34:53,961
it requires
a certain kind of hero.

693
00:34:54,004 --> 00:34:56,659
- And what kind
of hero would that be?

694
00:34:57,269 --> 00:34:59,488
- Well, that is to say...

695
00:34:59,532 --> 00:35:01,490
To use the common tongue,

696
00:35:01,534 --> 00:35:03,971
a--a--hero with a...

697
00:35:04,014 --> 00:35:06,104
pork loin?

698
00:35:08,584 --> 00:35:11,848
- So the apocalypse
is happening or whatever,

699
00:35:11,892 --> 00:35:15,113
and this little piggy
comes all this way,

700
00:35:15,156 --> 00:35:17,680
but you won't accept my help

701
00:35:17,724 --> 00:35:19,552
because I'm a woman?

702
00:35:19,595 --> 00:35:21,206
- Quite right.

703
00:35:21,249 --> 00:35:24,557
Well, I have
a long journey ahead of me.

704
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,516
This has been
a dreadful setback,

705
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,259
but I'm sure that
a hero will rise

706
00:35:31,303 --> 00:35:33,174
and he will save us.

707
00:35:38,223 --> 00:35:42,531
Madam, I have heard
from many trusted sources

708
00:35:42,575 --> 00:35:45,186
that hysteria such as yours
can be cured,

709
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,840
temporarily,

710
00:35:46,883 --> 00:35:49,886
through pelvic massage.

711
00:35:52,193 --> 00:35:54,064
I must go.

712
00:35:59,244 --> 00:36:01,681
- Look familiar?

713
00:36:01,724 --> 00:36:04,858
This building, our target?

714
00:36:04,901 --> 00:36:06,816
It's missing.

715
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:09,297
- Maybe it's some kind
of optical displacement spell?

716
00:36:09,341 --> 00:36:11,865
Like the building's hidden?

717
00:36:11,908 --> 00:36:13,606
- Come on.

718
00:36:15,825 --> 00:36:17,044
- Hey, man, can you tell me,

719
00:36:17,087 --> 00:36:18,698
did there used to be
a building here?

720
00:36:18,741 --> 00:36:20,961
- I don't think so.
- Are you sure?

721
00:36:21,004 --> 00:36:21,962
- I mean, I've only worked
in this park

722
00:36:22,005 --> 00:36:23,268
for, like, eight years,

723
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:25,835
but yeah,
maybe I'm wrong about it.

724
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,319
- Well, guy says there
was never a building here,

725
00:36:31,363 --> 00:36:33,930
so looks like
Gavin ripped us off.

726
00:36:33,974 --> 00:36:35,193
- He didn't rip us off.

727
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:36,977
There was a building.

728
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,588
I can still see
the residue from the wards.

729
00:36:39,632 --> 00:36:41,111
- So what happened to it?

730
00:36:41,155 --> 00:36:42,939
- I think someone stole it.

731
00:36:42,983 --> 00:36:45,333
Then mind-wiped
everyone in the area.

732
00:36:46,943 --> 00:36:48,902
Do you know what kind of
skills it would take

733
00:36:48,945 --> 00:36:50,947
to steal
a building with Level 5 wards?

734
00:36:50,991 --> 00:36:53,254
That's, like,
Gandalf-level skills.

735
00:36:53,298 --> 00:36:54,821
That's like--wait.

736
00:36:54,864 --> 00:36:56,344
Gandalf was a wizard, right?

737
00:36:56,388 --> 00:36:59,347
- Pete, just...shit.

738
00:37:01,131 --> 00:37:03,264
I think we might have
some competition.

739
00:37:03,308 --> 00:37:05,266
- So the apocalypse is coming

740
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:07,094
but don't worry your
pretty little head about it?

741
00:37:07,137 --> 00:37:08,617
What are we gonna do?

742
00:37:08,661 --> 00:37:09,923
- It's not like he's
the first guy to tell me

743
00:37:09,966 --> 00:37:11,751
I'm not good enough.

744
00:37:11,794 --> 00:37:14,275
- Right, and how screwed
is the universe that it doesn't

745
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:16,712
even realize Quentin's dead
and plan around it?

746
00:37:16,756 --> 00:37:19,019
- Truth?
I don't think the universe

747
00:37:19,062 --> 00:37:21,282
is really looking
out for anyone.

748
00:37:21,326 --> 00:37:23,676
Try saying that
to your students.

749
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:27,201
- I think I've already told
them all the depressing things.

750
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,942
Can't believe
I have to go back.

751
00:37:28,985 --> 00:37:30,857
What the ---- am I
gonna say to them?

752
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,294
- Well...what would you say

753
00:37:33,338 --> 00:37:35,296
if you could say
anything you wanted?

754
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,124
'Cause you can.

755
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:39,082
- Well, what would
you say to the pig?

756
00:37:43,173 --> 00:37:45,132
I'd say...

757
00:37:45,175 --> 00:37:47,874
Hey, Porky.

758
00:37:47,917 --> 00:37:50,224
If I wait for you
to tell me to be the hero,

759
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,270
then I'm just buying
into your bullshit.

760
00:37:52,313 --> 00:37:54,446
In real life you
don't get chosen.

761
00:37:54,489 --> 00:37:57,666
You choose your quest.

762
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,799
And I'm choosing mine.

763
00:37:59,842 --> 00:38:01,322
Yeah.

764
00:38:01,366 --> 00:38:03,672
You know, I got magic back
because Quentin died.

765
00:38:03,716 --> 00:38:05,892
And I think I know what
I'm gonna do with it.

766
00:38:05,935 --> 00:38:08,373
I'm gonna figure out
what's causing the apocalypse

767
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:10,070
and I'm gonna stop it.

768
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,253
- When I got to Brakebills,

769
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,733
I thought I'd die
before I turned 30.

770
00:38:20,776 --> 00:38:21,777
That's all
anyone ever told me:

771
00:38:21,821 --> 00:38:23,605
Travelers die.

772
00:38:23,649 --> 00:38:25,607
And bad shit has happened
to me,

773
00:38:25,651 --> 00:38:27,305
but not to you,

774
00:38:27,348 --> 00:38:29,437
not yet, anyway.

775
00:38:29,481 --> 00:38:32,222
You still get a choice
about your path.

776
00:38:33,572 --> 00:38:35,704
And since I already
talked about the bad side,

777
00:38:35,748 --> 00:38:38,577
I should probably
show you the good side too.

778
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:42,755
Anyone who wants
to see that, come here.

779
00:38:50,371 --> 00:38:52,460
- Cool, you brought
us to...

780
00:38:52,504 --> 00:38:53,635
rocks.

781
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,558
- Look up.

782
00:39:07,257 --> 00:39:08,650
A few years ago, I was running

783
00:39:08,694 --> 00:39:10,609
from some bad shit
and I found this place.

784
00:39:10,652 --> 00:39:12,350
It's not on any map.

785
00:39:13,568 --> 00:39:15,222
You guys can breathe.

786
00:39:16,745 --> 00:39:18,747
- There's no one here, just us.
- My God.

787
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:20,793
- When you master your powers,

788
00:39:20,836 --> 00:39:23,926
you can wake up anywhere,
in any world.

789
00:39:25,275 --> 00:39:27,669
If you want to still do this,
I'll help you.

790
00:39:27,713 --> 00:39:29,236
Just think about it.

791
00:39:30,716 --> 00:39:32,935
For now, I am gonna shut up

792
00:39:32,979 --> 00:39:34,850
and let you enjoy this place.

793
00:39:41,553 --> 00:39:43,555
Professor Adiyodi?

794
00:39:43,598 --> 00:39:45,252
- Merritt, right?

795
00:39:45,295 --> 00:39:48,037
- Yeah...I had a question.

796
00:39:48,081 --> 00:39:50,997
You said you heard voices
from other worlds.

797
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,868
- Are you hearing something?

798
00:39:52,912 --> 00:39:55,393
- It's not a voice;
it's more like, um...

799
00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:57,569
A signal?

800
00:39:57,612 --> 00:39:59,397
- Okay, um...

801
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,399
sit down.

802
00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:03,836
I'm gonna take down
my wards so you can show me.

803
00:40:03,879 --> 00:40:06,012
You just...
close your eyes, okay?

804
00:40:06,055 --> 00:40:07,796
- Okay.

805
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:36,434
Professor?

806
00:40:39,872 --> 00:40:42,440
Professor!
What happened?

807
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:43,441
- I don't--I don't--

808
00:40:43,484 --> 00:40:45,094
I couldn't control myself.

809
00:40:45,138 --> 00:40:47,445
- Did the signal
make you do that?

810
00:41:03,548 --> 00:41:05,593
- Hello?

811
00:41:05,637 --> 00:41:07,595
Anybody there?

812
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,868
Just great.

813
00:41:19,912 --> 00:41:22,436
What are you
gonna do now, Margo?

814
00:41:26,658 --> 00:41:28,877
- It's gonna be okay.

815
00:41:28,921 --> 00:41:32,577
It's gonna be okay.

816
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,448
Who am I kidding?

817
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,668
They're gonna chop
my goddamn head off.

818
00:41:38,147 --> 00:41:39,497
- Josh?

819
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,933
Josh!

820
00:41:40,976 --> 00:41:43,370
Josh!

821
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:46,504
Of course,
I got trapped in here

822
00:41:46,547 --> 00:41:48,462
with a ghost loop
version of him.

823
00:41:49,594 --> 00:41:50,551
- Margo,

824
00:41:50,595 --> 00:41:52,031
wherever you are,

825
00:41:52,074 --> 00:41:54,468
I hope you're okay.

826
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,166
I wish you were here.

827
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:59,691
I wish I wasn't
gonna die alone.

828
00:42:38,773 --> 00:42:41,036
- Why are you smoking?

829
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,864
- I don't know.

830
00:42:42,908 --> 00:42:45,606
Quentin did sometimes.

831
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:47,565
- Can I have one?

832
00:42:51,743 --> 00:42:53,788
- You know, you're
the only person in the world

833
00:42:53,832 --> 00:42:56,530
who can smoke judgmentally.

834
00:42:58,010 --> 00:42:59,707
- I know what
you're going through.

835
00:42:59,751 --> 00:43:02,667
When your father died,
I was a wreck.

836
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:04,973
I didn't know what to do.

837
00:43:05,017 --> 00:43:06,888
I wasn't ready to be alone.

838
00:43:06,932 --> 00:43:09,108
I didn't even know
how to be alone.

839
00:43:09,151 --> 00:43:12,459
I did some pretty insane
things just to get by.

840
00:43:14,548 --> 00:43:16,724
Insane even for me,

841
00:43:16,768 --> 00:43:18,813
but I'll spare you
the details.

842
00:43:18,857 --> 00:43:20,641
- Doesn't sound like you.

843
00:43:20,685 --> 00:43:22,861
- Well, I could
tell you if you prefer.

844
00:43:22,904 --> 00:43:25,472
- What's your point, Mom?

845
00:43:25,515 --> 00:43:29,084
That everything's just
gonna get better, eventually?

846
00:43:29,128 --> 00:43:32,697
- No one gets to tell
you how to grieve, Alice.

847
00:43:34,089 --> 00:43:36,875
You're on this
journey by yourself.

848
00:43:36,918 --> 00:43:40,226
Only you know where
it's gonna take you.

849
00:43:41,662 --> 00:43:45,144
If you need to do something
crazy to get through it...

850
00:43:46,711 --> 00:43:49,061
Do something crazy, okay?
