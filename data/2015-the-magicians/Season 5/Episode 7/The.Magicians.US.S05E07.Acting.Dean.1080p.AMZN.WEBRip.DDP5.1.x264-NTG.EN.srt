1
00:00:06,397 --> 00:00:08,138
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:08,182 --> 00:00:09,487
Charlton?

3
00:00:09,531 --> 00:00:12,577
I was a passenger
in your unconscious.

4
00:00:12,621 --> 00:00:15,754
Now I'm still in your head...

5
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:17,495
But the conscious part.

6
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:20,107
Whoa, I... I'm...
I'm no professor.

7
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,674
Penny, you're the only
Brakebills-educated traveler

8
00:00:22,718 --> 00:00:24,372
currently alive on this planet,

9
00:00:24,415 --> 00:00:26,374
which makes you far more
qualified to teach them

10
00:00:26,417 --> 00:00:27,766
than anyone else I have.

11
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,116
It's Fogg.

12
00:00:29,159 --> 00:00:30,439
He's stuck in the Etheric Realm,

13
00:00:30,465 --> 00:00:33,685
and it's my fault.

14
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:34,860
Hello.

15
00:00:34,904 --> 00:00:37,515
I am Bick of the esteemed
House Pickwick.

16
00:00:39,735 --> 00:00:42,564
I've been on the inside,
and I'm telling you

17
00:00:42,607 --> 00:00:44,218
it's a goddamn goose-stepping,

18
00:00:44,261 --> 00:00:47,569
fairy-snatching,
ethnic cleansing Gestapo.

19
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:55,577
Jesus.

20
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,494
So this pig dude told me
I'm supposed to do a quest?

21
00:00:59,537 --> 00:01:02,627
- Yeah, it's fine, Todd.
- We fixed it.

22
00:01:02,671 --> 00:01:04,760
The Harmonic Convergence
isn't happening anymore.

23
00:01:04,803 --> 00:01:07,676
- Uh, no.
- He was talking about Fillory.

24
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:09,765
The end of Fillory?

25
00:01:09,808 --> 00:01:12,550
So we saved the wrong world?

26
00:01:39,186 --> 00:01:41,579
- Todd, please stop.
- Okay.

27
00:01:41,623 --> 00:01:44,234
- Okay.
- Just wanna get this straight.

28
00:01:44,278 --> 00:01:47,411
So Pig Man gave you the quest
in the form of a song?

29
00:01:47,455 --> 00:01:48,499
Yeah.

30
00:01:48,543 --> 00:01:50,153
I might have changed
some of the lines,

31
00:01:50,197 --> 00:01:51,633
but that's the gist.

32
00:01:51,676 --> 00:01:53,591
There's also, like,
three more verses,

33
00:01:53,635 --> 00:01:55,332
and the key change is tricky.

34
00:01:56,464 --> 00:01:57,615
Or you could just write it down.

35
00:01:57,639 --> 00:01:58,640
Oh, I did.

36
00:01:58,683 --> 00:02:00,250
The parts I could
remember, anyway,

37
00:02:00,294 --> 00:02:01,251
on a couple of napkins

38
00:02:01,295 --> 00:02:02,600
and then on the back of my hand,

39
00:02:02,644 --> 00:02:03,645
but don't worry.

40
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:05,560
I transferred that
to another napkin.

41
00:02:05,603 --> 00:02:07,649
- But short version...
- Thank you.

42
00:02:07,692 --> 00:02:10,173
Fillory is in real trouble.

43
00:02:10,217 --> 00:02:13,350
He said death is coming

44
00:02:13,394 --> 00:02:15,309
for everyone.

45
00:02:15,352 --> 00:02:18,877
And then he rhymed that
with "smeveryone."

46
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:21,924
Anyway,
could you please help me?

47
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:24,883
I'm not going to help you.

48
00:02:24,927 --> 00:02:27,190
I'm going to take over
entirely for you.

49
00:02:27,234 --> 00:02:28,583
Oh, thank God,

50
00:02:28,626 --> 00:02:31,673
because I am dangerously
underqualified for this.

51
00:02:31,716 --> 00:02:32,674
I know.

52
00:02:32,717 --> 00:02:33,825
My notes are at Brakebills.

53
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:35,372
I probably should've
brought 'em.

54
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:37,505
Okay, so I'll meet you there.

55
00:02:37,548 --> 00:02:39,550
- Kay, bye.
- Okay.

56
00:02:42,292 --> 00:02:43,946
Yeah, no shit,
Fillory's in trouble.

57
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:45,730
Goes by the name
of the Dark King.

58
00:02:45,774 --> 00:02:47,950
Or whoever's ordering
dark shit on his behalf.

59
00:02:47,993 --> 00:02:49,299
We're still investigating.

60
00:02:49,343 --> 00:02:50,668
Which we were kind
of in the middle of

61
00:02:50,692 --> 00:02:52,235
till you dragged us here
'cause you were sure.

62
00:02:52,259 --> 00:02:53,651
Bacon McSwine-Flu
was talking about

63
00:02:53,695 --> 00:02:55,479
the Harmonic Convergence.

64
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:58,656
Oops, we accidentally stopped
billions of people from dying.

65
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,397
- I'm sorry.
- Hmm.

66
00:03:00,441 --> 00:03:01,572
Look, I guessed wrong,

67
00:03:01,616 --> 00:03:03,618
which is why you guys
should wait

68
00:03:03,661 --> 00:03:06,273
until I finish reading Todd's
notes before you rush off.

69
00:03:06,316 --> 00:03:08,275
Mm, I don't need Todd

70
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:11,321
to tell me which twat's
messing up my kingdom.

71
00:03:11,365 --> 00:03:13,430
But if he gives you a clue
how to stop the Dark King,

72
00:03:13,454 --> 00:03:14,474
you know where to find us.

73
00:03:14,498 --> 00:03:16,413
Oh, and tell Josh to meet me

74
00:03:16,457 --> 00:03:18,720
once he's done with
his nephew's bar mitzvah.

75
00:03:18,763 --> 00:03:20,548
Dude drops everything
for family.

76
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:21,810
It's weird.

77
00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:34,736
Oh, shit.

78
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,913
Uh, sorry I missed the meeting.

79
00:03:37,956 --> 00:03:40,002
I can't travel, and...
None of us can.

80
00:03:40,045 --> 00:03:41,873
We all made it here on time,

81
00:03:41,917 --> 00:03:44,441
'cause "emergency
faculty meeting."

82
00:03:44,485 --> 00:03:45,723
- Yeah, what's going on?
- What did Lipson say?

83
00:03:45,747 --> 00:03:46,965
Well, she's in a coma,

84
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:48,706
- so not much.
- What?

85
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,510
I don't know if you tried
casting yet today,

86
00:03:50,534 --> 00:03:51,927
Don't.

87
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,450
Circumstances are jacked.

88
00:03:53,494 --> 00:03:55,757
- Some asshole moved the moon.
- Oh, shit.

89
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:58,673
Acting Dean Lipson
was resetting the campus wards,

90
00:03:58,716 --> 00:04:00,892
didn't realize
the Circumstances had changed.

91
00:04:00,936 --> 00:04:03,286
Fogg's security system
was sicced on her instead.

92
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,418
Is she gonna be okay?

93
00:04:04,461 --> 00:04:05,419
From what I hear,

94
00:04:05,462 --> 00:04:06,898
she didn't lose anything vital.

95
00:04:06,942 --> 00:04:08,465
Most of it'll grow back,

96
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:09,789
but we can't even heal her be...

97
00:04:09,814 --> 00:04:11,555
Because some asshole
moved the moon.

98
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,774
- Yeah, I got it.
- Yeah.

99
00:04:15,951 --> 00:04:17,648
Can you shut
the security system down

100
00:04:17,692 --> 00:04:19,041
before anyone else gets hurt?

101
00:04:19,084 --> 00:04:22,305
The Dean of Brakebills can
with this, in theory.

102
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:25,482
Although, that's what Lipson
was doing when she got...

103
00:04:25,526 --> 00:04:26,590
Okay, so what?

104
00:04:26,614 --> 00:04:28,442
Are you in charge then?

105
00:04:28,485 --> 00:04:30,008
- You missed the boat.
- Oh, it's cool.

106
00:04:30,052 --> 00:04:31,595
I honestly couldn't give
less of a shit.

107
00:04:31,619 --> 00:04:33,447
- No, Penny.
- It's a horrible job.

108
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,448
Nobody wants it.

109
00:04:34,491 --> 00:04:37,451
We all voted for you.

110
00:04:38,103 --> 00:04:41,368
You assholes.

111
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:43,326
The hell am I even
supposed to do with this?

112
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,675
Well, if I knew that,

113
00:04:44,719 --> 00:04:46,329
I wouldn't be giving it to you.

114
00:04:46,373 --> 00:04:48,679
Good luck.

115
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,612
Where the hell
could Fen have gone?

116
00:05:08,656 --> 00:05:09,961
I know, right?

117
00:05:10,005 --> 00:05:11,746
I gave her one... two...

118
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:14,705
Well, several jobs,
but the headline was

119
00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:16,054
"stay put and find the creep

120
00:05:16,098 --> 00:05:17,621
with the hard-on
for hunting fairies."

121
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:25,977
- Okay, was he afraid of you?
- Yup.

122
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:27,805
They all think it's my
"time of the month."

123
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:29,851
- Woman or wolf?
- Who cares?

124
00:05:29,894 --> 00:05:31,872
Either way, I got 'em scared
they'll end up bleeding, too,

125
00:05:31,896 --> 00:05:33,985
so I'm off the hook
for a few weeks.

126
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:35,639
Perk of marching
with a bunch of scrotes

127
00:05:35,683 --> 00:05:37,467
who have no clue
how lady parts work.

128
00:05:37,511 --> 00:05:38,642
Mm.

129
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:44,822
Yes, your most excellent
Pouchful-ness.

130
00:05:44,866 --> 00:05:46,433
It'll be done straight away.

131
00:05:46,476 --> 00:05:49,392
I also brewed clover tea,
your favorite.

132
00:05:50,872 --> 00:05:52,830
Odious veldt marmot.

133
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:54,571
Problems with the new boss,
Rafe?

134
00:05:54,615 --> 00:05:57,052
I hear she's a handful,
between us.

135
00:05:58,227 --> 00:05:59,576
Between us?

136
00:06:01,186 --> 00:06:04,015
Her High Leapus Gertrude
is a nightmare.

137
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:05,582
Who's got the King's ear.

138
00:06:05,626 --> 00:06:06,844
Sadly, yes.

139
00:06:06,888 --> 00:06:08,498
I took the job with her
to try and make

140
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:10,979
the King's Council
more animal-friendly,

141
00:06:11,022 --> 00:06:13,547
but that creature
is a traitor to her own.

142
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,766
Never trust an animal
with a pouch.

143
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:19,466
She's nothing but a puppet
to the king's chief advisor.

144
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:21,772
- Which is who again?
- Bick Pickwick.

145
00:06:21,816 --> 00:06:23,818
The sexist douche
who ran the tournament?

146
00:06:23,861 --> 00:06:25,689
He offered Her Long-footed-ness

147
00:06:25,733 --> 00:06:28,431
a handsome deal
to permanently relocate

148
00:06:28,475 --> 00:06:31,042
all talking animals
beyond the walls.

149
00:06:31,086 --> 00:06:34,437
Bick has a deep hatred
for anything non-human.

150
00:06:34,481 --> 00:06:36,787
- Non-human meaning fairies.
- Mm-hmm.

151
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:38,702
Bick's position
could also explain

152
00:06:38,746 --> 00:06:41,183
why there might be species
cleansing without Seb knowing.

153
00:06:41,226 --> 00:06:42,576
What are you, dickmatized?

154
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:43,925
No way Seb doesn't know.

155
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:45,468
There was plenty happening
I didn't know about

156
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:46,536
when I was High King.

157
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,905
Which was fine,
because you had me.

158
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:49,496
And Her Slowness, Abigail.

159
00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:50,758
Oh.

160
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:52,213
Look, we'll argue,
and I'll win later.

161
00:06:52,237 --> 00:06:54,085
Right now we gotta find Fen
and see if she did her job

162
00:06:54,109 --> 00:06:56,546
and got any new intel
on the fairies.

163
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,548
Oh, I was supposed to tell you.

164
00:06:58,592 --> 00:07:01,682
Um, before she left, Fen said,

165
00:07:01,725 --> 00:07:05,990
"The Maid on the Outside
will soon be on the Inside."

166
00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:08,471
And by "inside," she meant...

167
00:07:08,515 --> 00:07:09,994
I'm not sure.

168
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:12,562
At times, she is what
the animals call "human crazy."

169
00:07:12,606 --> 00:07:13,607
Anything else?

170
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:14,825
Just that she was venturing

171
00:07:14,869 --> 00:07:16,566
into the Windward Woods.

172
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:19,526
I'm gonna bank she's doing
her actual job fairy-wise

173
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:20,962
and not just bird-watching.

174
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:22,572
- Let's find her.
- You go ahead.

175
00:07:22,616 --> 00:07:24,835
I'll go pursue
a different line of inquiry.

176
00:07:33,104 --> 00:07:34,105
Yeah?

177
00:07:35,019 --> 00:07:36,891
Professor... I mean...

178
00:07:36,934 --> 00:07:38,501
Dean Adiyodi?

179
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:40,155
Yeah, come in.

180
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:44,594
I have a problem.

181
00:07:44,638 --> 00:07:46,770
A very big problem.

182
00:07:48,206 --> 00:07:50,731
Someone stole my pencil case.

183
00:07:50,774 --> 00:07:52,994
Full of... drugs?

184
00:07:53,037 --> 00:07:55,692
Pencils. Special pencils.

185
00:07:55,736 --> 00:07:57,302
And you thought,

186
00:07:57,346 --> 00:07:59,914
"Hey, this a problem
I should bring to the Dean..."

187
00:07:59,957 --> 00:08:01,611
I think there's
a conspiracy afoot,

188
00:08:01,655 --> 00:08:03,308
a league of mischief makers

189
00:08:03,352 --> 00:08:04,962
with a taste
for high-end graphite.

190
00:08:08,357 --> 00:08:10,577
So we tried to cast
a cleansing spell,

191
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,536
and instead, it just...
It made live chickens.

192
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,844
So many chickens.

193
00:08:16,887 --> 00:08:20,543
So apparently the fertility
and contraception charms

194
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:23,764
got switched, so, um,

195
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,070
we have a bit of a situation.

196
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:29,529
They're special because of
their smear resistance and...

197
00:08:31,859 --> 00:08:33,619
I don't think you're
taking me very seriously.

198
00:08:33,643 --> 00:08:35,253
I promise you I am not.

199
00:08:35,297 --> 00:08:37,081
All the air in there
just turned to water.

200
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:40,128
I shouldn't have to be able
to swim to take astronomy.

201
00:08:40,171 --> 00:08:42,173
Go away.

202
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,656
You really did it this time,
huh?

203
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,092
Zelda warned us it would happen.

204
00:08:48,136 --> 00:08:50,573
We changed the Circumstances
of the moon for good.

205
00:08:50,617 --> 00:08:52,923
Yeah.

206
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:54,229
What do we do?

207
00:08:54,272 --> 00:08:57,275
We try to live with what we did.

208
00:08:57,319 --> 00:08:58,886
Back to basics.

209
00:08:58,929 --> 00:09:01,279
Figure out how to cast again.
Magic 101.

210
00:09:01,323 --> 00:09:02,629
That's why I'm here,

211
00:09:02,672 --> 00:09:04,587
but we have
to figure it out fast.

212
00:09:04,631 --> 00:09:06,031
We stopped
the Harmonic Convergence,

213
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:07,764
but there's still
too much magic.

214
00:09:07,808 --> 00:09:09,636
Right, and...

215
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,289
If a surge happens,

216
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:16,686
every spell already jacked
is gonna get me amped up to 11.

217
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,122
Christ!

218
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:21,299
It's too bad Fogg was sober
when he left.

219
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:29,307
- What is it?
- I don't know.

220
00:09:29,351 --> 00:09:30,831
But I'd say
this is an emergency.

221
00:09:30,874 --> 00:09:33,398
Wouldn't you?

222
00:09:33,442 --> 00:09:35,313
"For Emergencies Only."

223
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:37,228
That's not ominous at all.

224
00:09:37,272 --> 00:09:39,709
Based on
the locator spells on it,

225
00:09:39,753 --> 00:09:41,798
we thought maybe
it was built to...

226
00:09:41,842 --> 00:09:43,234
To summon Fogg.

227
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:45,149
Think it could reach
the Etheric Realm?

228
00:09:45,193 --> 00:09:46,890
I mean,
Kady said he can't leave,

229
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:48,892
but maybe we could get
a message out.

230
00:09:48,936 --> 00:09:50,981
Even if we could get it
to reach Fogg,

231
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:52,437
using any magic right now
could backfire,

232
00:09:52,461 --> 00:09:53,941
like it did to Lipson.

233
00:09:53,984 --> 00:09:55,899
Look, students
are in actual danger,

234
00:09:55,943 --> 00:09:58,249
this campus is going haywire,

235
00:09:58,293 --> 00:10:00,251
no one knows when
the next surge'll hit,

236
00:10:00,295 --> 00:10:02,689
and I have no idea how to help.

237
00:10:02,732 --> 00:10:04,168
I hate to admit it,
but I think Fogg

238
00:10:04,212 --> 00:10:06,146
was doing way more work
than we give him credit for.

239
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,476
We need him back,

240
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,826
and if this thing can
at least contact him...

241
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,437
Sounds like it's worth the risk.

242
00:10:12,481 --> 00:10:14,178
Okay.

243
00:10:14,222 --> 00:10:15,702
Whew.

244
00:10:15,745 --> 00:10:18,313
This shit messes me up.

245
00:10:18,356 --> 00:10:19,923
What the hell, Julia?

246
00:10:19,967 --> 00:10:22,230
I'm fine. Did it work?

247
00:10:24,493 --> 00:10:26,776
It's probably broken like
everything else in this school.

248
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,634
Duty calls.

249
00:10:40,335 --> 00:10:42,119
Jesus. Hi.

250
00:10:42,163 --> 00:10:43,686
Where have you been?

251
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:45,340
Well, I have to sleep sometimes,

252
00:10:45,383 --> 00:10:47,143
and everything you do
isn't that interesting.

253
00:10:47,168 --> 00:10:48,473
I'm thinking whatever I miss,

254
00:10:48,517 --> 00:10:50,737
I'll just find
in your brain later.

255
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,348
What do you people call it?
Uh, binge watching.

256
00:10:53,391 --> 00:10:55,045
I fear outright rebellion.

257
00:10:55,089 --> 00:10:56,414
The best and swiftest way
to get it...

258
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:58,701
To get what? Your Majesty.

259
00:10:58,745 --> 00:10:59,876
Gold.

260
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,791
Our reserves are depleted.

261
00:11:01,835 --> 00:11:03,401
The salaries of our soldiers

262
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:05,752
and barrier builders
haven't been paid in weeks,

263
00:11:05,795 --> 00:11:07,710
and both are threatening
to strike.

264
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:11,496
The slightest work stoppage
could imperil all of us.

265
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,847
As reports indicate,

266
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:16,327
the Takers are gathering
in force.

267
00:11:16,371 --> 00:11:19,330
Which is why I must lead
a cohort of Centurions

268
00:11:19,374 --> 00:11:21,898
into the Windward Woods
and find the gold

269
00:11:21,942 --> 00:11:24,945
the fairies steal and hoard.

270
00:11:24,988 --> 00:11:27,948
Okay, but that really
doesn't track.

271
00:11:27,991 --> 00:11:31,778
Fairies are into mushrooms
and milk baths.

272
00:11:31,821 --> 00:11:33,780
You have experience with them?

273
00:11:33,823 --> 00:11:35,216
I do, sire.

274
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:37,194
- Mostly bad, right?
- According to your memories.

275
00:11:37,218 --> 00:11:39,046
Then you know that
they're as untrustworthy

276
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:41,048
as they are greedy.

277
00:11:41,091 --> 00:11:44,007
They have purloined
our citizens' gold for years.

278
00:11:44,051 --> 00:11:45,922
My men and I will get it back.

279
00:11:45,966 --> 00:11:48,359
If I may, Your Majesty.

280
00:11:48,403 --> 00:11:50,057
I do have experience
with fairies,

281
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,755
and while they are
crafty negotiators,

282
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:54,975
they're not thieves.

283
00:11:55,018 --> 00:11:58,021
If they have our citizens' gold,

284
00:11:58,065 --> 00:12:00,023
perhaps it's from
a misunderstanding

285
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:02,199
that can be worked out
diplomatically.

286
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:04,854
Payments are due no later
than tomorrow's sunset.

287
00:12:04,898 --> 00:12:06,464
I'm quite aware.

288
00:12:06,508 --> 00:12:08,031
And diplomacy...

289
00:12:08,075 --> 00:12:10,773
Can always be followed by force,

290
00:12:10,817 --> 00:12:12,993
but the reverse is rarely true.

291
00:12:14,908 --> 00:12:16,518
Okay.

292
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:19,347
I get the charisma.
His intelligence.

293
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,392
- He's royal but down to Earth.
- Yeah, it's true.

294
00:12:21,436 --> 00:12:22,959
- It works.
- Mm-hmm.

295
00:12:23,003 --> 00:12:25,092
But trust him?

296
00:12:25,135 --> 00:12:27,007
Truly?

297
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,139
We need five pounds of gold
by tomorrow

298
00:12:29,183 --> 00:12:31,315
and another 15
by the week's end,

299
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:34,275
or the life of every Fillorian
is in peril.

300
00:12:37,147 --> 00:12:38,888
Accompany Pickwick.

301
00:12:38,932 --> 00:12:40,803
If you find
the fairies' encampment,

302
00:12:40,847 --> 00:12:43,066
you have one hour to negotiate.

303
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,155
If that fails,

304
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:47,288
you'll stand down
and let the Centurions

305
00:12:47,331 --> 00:12:49,464
do whatever is necessary.

306
00:12:49,507 --> 00:12:51,945
I trust your wisdom, sire.

307
00:13:00,605 --> 00:13:03,086
Whoa! Hey, easy.

308
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,479
I'm High King Margo.

309
00:13:04,522 --> 00:13:06,046
We were all pals
back in the day.

310
00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:08,048
Oh, we know who you are.

311
00:13:09,397 --> 00:13:11,268
Look, my friend
was supposed to find you.

312
00:13:11,312 --> 00:13:13,314
- I think we can help each other.
- Margo?

313
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,797
It's okay, Rowan. She's with me.

314
00:13:24,325 --> 00:13:26,588
Ugh.

315
00:13:26,631 --> 00:13:28,938
If that's from the selkie
in the east fountain,

316
00:13:28,982 --> 00:13:31,027
you might want to get tested
for the clap.

317
00:13:31,071 --> 00:13:33,769
Holy shit, am I glad to see you.

318
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,094
How'd you get out
of the Etheric Realm?

319
00:13:35,118 --> 00:13:36,816
Long story.

320
00:13:36,859 --> 00:13:38,905
Point is, I heard your call.

321
00:13:38,948 --> 00:13:40,907
I'm here, and yes,

322
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,996
I could use a goddamn drink.

323
00:13:44,432 --> 00:13:47,522
- Weren't you sober?
- Ah, yes.

324
00:13:47,565 --> 00:13:49,393
Right, well,

325
00:13:49,437 --> 00:13:51,743
the Etheric Realm was a lot.

326
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,878
Let's find a bottle,

327
00:13:55,922 --> 00:13:58,011
and you can fill me in.

328
00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:00,535
Okay.

329
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:08,543
The traveler professor
who cannot travel

330
00:14:08,586 --> 00:14:11,807
is now the Acting Dean.

331
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,591
Students are
blowing themselves up,

332
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:15,898
and I presume

333
00:14:15,942 --> 00:14:19,902
you are the aforementioned
"assholes who moved the moon."

334
00:14:19,946 --> 00:14:22,557
Yes, but I found a workaround.

335
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,821
If you cast as if your altitude
is 1,000 feet lower

336
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,650
and the Pleiades are six
degrees further to the north,

337
00:14:28,693 --> 00:14:30,521
well, then...

338
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,525
Ah.

339
00:14:34,569 --> 00:14:36,136
If we apply this tweak
to every spell,

340
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:39,400
we can teach people to cast
without exploding

341
00:14:39,443 --> 00:14:42,011
or turning things into chickens.

342
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:43,970
What happened to your hand?

343
00:14:44,013 --> 00:14:46,581
I thought the Etheric Realm
was supposed to be a fun trip.

344
00:14:46,624 --> 00:14:48,496
Yes.

345
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:50,367
Leaving it, less so,

346
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:52,543
but I had no choice.

347
00:14:52,587 --> 00:14:54,086
I couldn't risk anyone else
getting hurt

348
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,025
by the security system I built.

349
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,899
Yes, I can deactivate it,

350
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:02,640
and I will need
the master key, please.

351
00:15:04,729 --> 00:15:06,557
- Thank you.
- Whoa, hold up, hold up.

352
00:15:06,601 --> 00:15:08,864
I still got student problems
to put on your radar.

353
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,998
Penny, I have to go save
hundreds of lives.

354
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,914
I think you can handle
a few whiny students.

355
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:18,569
See? Delegating!

356
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:22,486
Look, we got
a common enemy here.

357
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:23,705
The Dark King's goons

358
00:15:23,748 --> 00:15:25,141
are itching to make
your life hell.

359
00:15:25,185 --> 00:15:27,970
We've always dealt
with hostile humans.

360
00:15:28,014 --> 00:15:29,711
Yeah, well,
this one's got an army.

361
00:15:29,754 --> 00:15:31,104
In which you serve.

362
00:15:31,147 --> 00:15:33,106
I'm undercover so I can
get information on him,

363
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:35,151
which we could be sharing
with each other right now

364
00:15:35,195 --> 00:15:37,458
if you'd just set your
motherfucker to receive.

365
00:15:37,501 --> 00:15:39,634
Okay, let's dial it down, guys.

366
00:15:39,677 --> 00:15:41,037
We're all friends here.

367
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,724
Forgive my bluntness, Fen,

368
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:44,421
but your choice of friends

369
00:15:44,465 --> 00:15:45,988
makes me doubt
our choice of ally.

370
00:15:46,032 --> 00:15:47,816
Maybe you're too young
or dumb to remember,

371
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:50,079
but I'm the king who made peace
with your people.

372
00:15:50,123 --> 00:15:51,602
Is that what you think you did?

373
00:15:51,646 --> 00:15:52,647
Yeah.

374
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,041
Rowan, wait.

375
00:15:57,521 --> 00:15:59,045
Okay, what does she think I did?

376
00:15:59,088 --> 00:16:02,004
Well, very few fairies who
knew you are still alive today,

377
00:16:02,048 --> 00:16:05,486
and the rest just know
the story of High King Margo,

378
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:07,183
which, over the centuries,

379
00:16:07,227 --> 00:16:10,491
shifted with each retelling.

380
00:16:10,534 --> 00:16:12,928
So I'm being boned
by a giant game of telephone.

381
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,016
No, no, no, no, no.

382
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,757
Phone games are fun...
This, not so much.

383
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,761
See, you say you made peace.

384
00:16:19,804 --> 00:16:21,676
They say you destroyed
their realm

385
00:16:21,719 --> 00:16:23,547
and allowed
fairy hunts for sport.

386
00:16:23,591 --> 00:16:25,593
It's a real "potato, potahto."

387
00:16:25,636 --> 00:16:28,030
No, it's "potato,
po-massive-fucking-lie."

388
00:16:28,074 --> 00:16:31,077
Look, I found them,
gained their trust.

389
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,864
You think that was easy for me
after what happened to my baby?

390
00:16:35,907 --> 00:16:37,605
But I did it.

391
00:16:37,648 --> 00:16:41,043
And then you barrel in and just
completely screw the pooch.

392
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:43,872
- And not in a good way.
- Okay.

393
00:16:43,915 --> 00:16:45,613
You know what? You're right.

394
00:16:45,656 --> 00:16:49,008
I... uh, yeah.

395
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:50,270
I am.

396
00:16:50,313 --> 00:16:53,882
But now the fairies
need to trust us both.

397
00:16:53,925 --> 00:16:56,015
How can I help make that happen?

398
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,800
You won't like it.

399
00:17:06,155 --> 00:17:08,070
Oh, that's not right.

400
00:17:10,681 --> 00:17:13,771
I know what I'm doing,
if you don't mind.

401
00:17:13,815 --> 00:17:15,034
It's a mistake.

402
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:17,036
For sure.

403
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,255
I'm correcting spells
for the new Circumstances.

404
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:22,041
It's math.
I don't make mistakes at math.

405
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:24,260
No, I mean,

406
00:17:24,304 --> 00:17:27,089
that is a spell
for cooking without a fire,

407
00:17:27,133 --> 00:17:29,135
but for real...

408
00:17:29,178 --> 00:17:31,137
that's gonna be
a pretty terrible steak.

409
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:34,140
You need flame
to denature the proteins.

410
00:17:34,183 --> 00:17:36,098
What do I know, though?

411
00:17:36,142 --> 00:17:37,795
You a teacher here?

412
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:38,840
We could be colleagues.

413
00:17:38,883 --> 00:17:41,060
I'm interviewing
for the botany job.

414
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:42,757
Hamish Bax.

415
00:17:43,975 --> 00:17:46,152
Alice Quinn.

416
00:17:46,195 --> 00:17:48,284
Not related to Stephanie Quinn,

417
00:17:48,328 --> 00:17:49,546
are you?

418
00:17:50,852 --> 00:17:53,855
We met at a rare flower expo.

419
00:17:53,898 --> 00:17:57,206
I found her orchid
quite impressive.

420
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,034
Oh, God.

421
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,254
No. No, nothing like that.

422
00:18:01,297 --> 00:18:04,126
I would never date
another botanist.

423
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:10,089
Wait. Shit.

424
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:12,830
I don't understand.
My fix was working.

425
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,791
According to Todd's napkins,
there are,

426
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:22,753
"evil forces coming from
a distant realm to invade."

427
00:18:22,797 --> 00:18:25,016
You think this is enough
to go on?

428
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,236
Well, Fillory was overrun
by these Taker creatures,

429
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,195
so it's gotta be them.

430
00:18:29,238 --> 00:18:31,240
So you're going?

431
00:18:31,284 --> 00:18:33,851
- I could use your help.
- I could use yours.

432
00:18:35,766 --> 00:18:38,595
Fogg's back.

433
00:18:38,639 --> 00:18:41,076
You didn't even want
to be a professor.

434
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,000
We're talking about the fate
of an entire world.

435
00:18:43,034 --> 00:18:44,314
Didn't we just do this, though?

436
00:18:45,515 --> 00:18:47,604
One minute,
it's the Harmonic Convergence,

437
00:18:47,648 --> 00:18:49,650
then it's the moon,
and now Fillory?

438
00:18:49,693 --> 00:18:52,261
Can't we just...
Sit back and relax?

439
00:18:52,305 --> 00:18:53,915
- No, but...
- Come on, Penny.

440
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,221
Look, you know what I'm after.

441
00:18:55,264 --> 00:18:57,962
A life with you,

442
00:18:58,006 --> 00:18:59,355
here or wherever, honestly.

443
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:00,835
Why not Fillory?

444
00:19:00,878 --> 00:19:03,620
Because not every apocalypse
is our problem.

445
00:19:03,664 --> 00:19:06,406
We just survived the last one
by a hair,

446
00:19:06,449 --> 00:19:08,123
and what is it all for
if we can't kick back

447
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,844
on a beach somewhere
and enjoy it?

448
00:19:09,887 --> 00:19:11,802
Let me tell you something.

449
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:15,371
The world doesn't wait
for timing to be right.

450
00:19:15,415 --> 00:19:17,286
I want to know
how long I've gotta wait.

451
00:19:18,287 --> 00:19:21,899
You live to 35,
and then you get to be done?

452
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:24,206
Or is this forever?

453
00:19:26,295 --> 00:19:27,992
I get you need magic
to mean something...

454
00:19:28,036 --> 00:19:29,777
Oh, I see what this is.

455
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,344
You think it's some
irrational reaction

456
00:19:31,387 --> 00:19:32,954
to my best friend dying,
and eventually,

457
00:19:32,997 --> 00:19:34,651
I'll just get over it?

458
00:19:35,826 --> 00:19:38,046
Well, your math
was right before.

459
00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:39,961
Okay, but it's definitely
not now.

460
00:19:40,004 --> 00:19:41,180
I don't know why, but I think

461
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:44,139
the Circumstances
just changed again.

462
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,141
Oh, shit.
I told Fogg it was safe.

463
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,230
If he tries to use my fix,
and it backfires...

464
00:19:48,274 --> 00:19:49,797
I have to warn him

465
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,234
before he tries to disable
the security system.

466
00:20:01,156 --> 00:20:03,332
Julia, I'm not judging you.

467
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:05,832
You're allowed to grieve
however you want.

468
00:20:05,856 --> 00:20:07,118
Thank you for your permission.

469
00:20:07,162 --> 00:20:08,835
Yeah, but the shit you do
affects me too.

470
00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:10,383
I think I can't
do what I need to do

471
00:20:10,426 --> 00:20:12,733
if I'm worried about how
it's gonna affect you.

472
00:20:12,776 --> 00:20:14,909
- Worried about me?
- I'm worried about you.

473
00:20:14,952 --> 00:20:17,172
Yeah. That's the problem.

474
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,391
So...

475
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:20,349
what are you saying?

476
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,917
I think we need to be done.

477
00:20:31,795 --> 00:20:34,058
Emergency protocols are active.

478
00:20:34,102 --> 00:20:35,408
The hell?

479
00:20:35,451 --> 00:20:36,776
For your own safety,
please stay in place

480
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,281
and await instructions.

481
00:20:39,325 --> 00:20:41,805
Emergency protocols are active.

482
00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:43,198
For your own safety,

483
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:47,115
please stay in place
and await instructions.

484
00:20:47,158 --> 00:20:49,770
Emergency protocols are active.

485
00:20:49,813 --> 00:20:51,162
For your own safety,

486
00:20:51,206 --> 00:20:54,905
please stay in place
and await instructions.

487
00:20:54,949 --> 00:20:56,385
Emergency protocols...

488
00:20:56,429 --> 00:20:58,102
Looks like you're not going
to Fillory after all.

489
00:20:58,126 --> 00:21:00,084
For your own safety,
please stay in place...

490
00:21:06,656 --> 00:21:09,311
Look, I really thought
I was doing the right thing.

491
00:21:09,355 --> 00:21:10,921
By robbing us of our homeland?

492
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:12,314
By giving you a place

493
00:21:12,358 --> 00:21:14,447
where you and your weird
mushroom eggs could survive.

494
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:17,624
You promised sanctuary
and left us vulnerable.

495
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:20,279
When your people persecuted us

496
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:22,542
because we had no way
to defend ourselves,

497
00:21:22,585 --> 00:21:24,979
you abandoned us.

498
00:21:25,022 --> 00:21:27,590
And you can understand

499
00:21:27,634 --> 00:21:30,593
how that would make the fairies
feel, can't you, Margo?

500
00:21:30,637 --> 00:21:31,812
Okay, yeah, of course

501
00:21:31,855 --> 00:21:33,901
I'm sorry you went through that,

502
00:21:33,944 --> 00:21:35,337
but it was after my reign ended.

503
00:21:35,381 --> 00:21:36,773
You really think that justifies

504
00:21:36,817 --> 00:21:38,340
the harm you set into motion?

505
00:21:38,384 --> 00:21:40,516
Jesus.

506
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,562
You step out
for 300 goddamn years,

507
00:21:42,605 --> 00:21:43,867
and a bunch of gossip girls

508
00:21:43,911 --> 00:21:45,751
turn your whole life
into the Nuremberg trials?

509
00:21:45,782 --> 00:21:47,175
Margo.

510
00:21:47,218 --> 00:21:50,352
Look, this diplomatic
milk bath is all very kabuki,

511
00:21:50,396 --> 00:21:52,354
but let me tell you
what my dad always said.

512
00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:54,443
"You can't fix stupid."

513
00:21:54,487 --> 00:21:56,358
Skipping past the fact
he always said it to me,

514
00:21:56,402 --> 00:21:58,882
I'll add,
I'm not the problem here,

515
00:21:58,926 --> 00:22:01,798
and if you don't work with me
to bring down the Dark King,

516
00:22:01,842 --> 00:22:03,757
you're Olympic-gold-medal
stupid.

517
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,455
- Ember's balls, Margo.
- Get out.

518
00:22:08,718 --> 00:22:11,547
Bick coming! Run, hide!

519
00:22:13,419 --> 00:22:15,856
Emergency protocols are active.

520
00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:17,945
Dean. Dean!

521
00:22:17,988 --> 00:22:20,687
And await instructions.

522
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:23,820
Emergency protocols are active.

523
00:22:23,864 --> 00:22:25,866
- Penny.
- The hell is going on?

524
00:22:28,129 --> 00:22:30,392
I'm afraid Alice's
circumstantial mediation

525
00:22:30,436 --> 00:22:31,741
didn't work.

526
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:33,458
When I tried to shut down
the security system,

527
00:22:33,482 --> 00:22:36,398
it set off all the school's
defenses at once.

528
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:38,922
- And you can't shut it down?
- I'm trying.

529
00:22:38,966 --> 00:22:41,403
In the meanwhile,
I strongly suggest you stay put

530
00:22:41,447 --> 00:22:44,580
so you don't get blown up
and sprayed with acid,

531
00:22:44,624 --> 00:22:47,409
eaten by centipedes,
or turned into one.

532
00:22:47,453 --> 00:22:49,455
This is a school.

533
00:22:50,456 --> 00:22:52,414
Hey, got most of it,
but we still need to...

534
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:53,981
- Yes, I know what we need.
- Let's go.

535
00:22:54,024 --> 00:22:55,548
Well, how can we help?

536
00:22:55,591 --> 00:22:57,071
Stay put.

537
00:22:57,114 --> 00:22:58,855
Eliot and I have it covered.

538
00:22:58,899 --> 00:23:00,770
You mean Todd?

539
00:23:01,597 --> 00:23:04,121
Y... yes. Of course.

540
00:23:04,165 --> 00:23:05,601
Isn't that what I said?

541
00:23:05,645 --> 00:23:07,473
Oh, wait, Todd.

542
00:23:07,516 --> 00:23:09,083
I just had a quick question,

543
00:23:09,126 --> 00:23:10,954
uh, about something
the Pig Man said.

544
00:23:10,998 --> 00:23:12,434
Of course, yeah.

545
00:23:12,478 --> 00:23:15,524
Which professor's Pig Man?

546
00:23:15,568 --> 00:23:19,049
The Pig Man. From Fillory?

547
00:23:19,093 --> 00:23:21,487
- What about him?
- Todd!

548
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,489
Sorry, gotta bounce.

549
00:23:25,578 --> 00:23:28,929
You saw that, right?

550
00:23:28,972 --> 00:23:31,148
He had no clue
what I was talking about.

551
00:23:31,192 --> 00:23:33,716
- It's Todd.
- He's always clueless.

552
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,153
No, I'm telling you
something's up.

553
00:23:36,197 --> 00:23:39,766
I mean, Fogg's acting off,
too, right?

554
00:23:39,809 --> 00:23:42,464
The drinking,
the burns on his hands.

555
00:23:42,508 --> 00:23:44,771
I just figured the Etheric
Realm did a number on him.

556
00:23:44,814 --> 00:23:48,557
You saw what Todd
was carrying, too, right?

557
00:23:48,601 --> 00:23:52,866
I mean, Azurite,
Bondoc Prisms, beech ash.

558
00:23:52,909 --> 00:23:55,477
That's all reserved
for Major Arcana.

559
00:23:55,521 --> 00:23:59,873
Or they could just be trying
to fix the security spells.

560
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:01,483
We should follow them.

561
00:24:01,527 --> 00:24:04,138
And get turned into
centipedes or whatever?

562
00:24:04,181 --> 00:24:06,053
No, thanks.

563
00:24:06,096 --> 00:24:07,576
Also, no offense,

564
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,012
rather not be around you
right now.

565
00:24:09,056 --> 00:24:10,884
What? Yeah, cool.

566
00:24:10,927 --> 00:24:13,756
Okay, stay here by yourself.
I... I'm gonna go.

567
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,541
And get turned into a centipede.

568
00:24:15,584 --> 00:24:16,716
Fuck.

569
00:24:18,892 --> 00:24:21,131
Well, this is definitely
the most exciting job interview

570
00:24:21,155 --> 00:24:23,549
I've ever been on.

571
00:24:23,592 --> 00:24:26,029
I don't understand why you're
still hoping to reach Fogg.

572
00:24:26,073 --> 00:24:29,119
He clearly tried your casting
tweak, and it backfired.

573
00:24:29,163 --> 00:24:30,749
Why we're trapped here
in the first place?

574
00:24:30,773 --> 00:24:32,471
Well, if he's trying to fix it,

575
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:33,559
he'll need to understand

576
00:24:33,602 --> 00:24:34,797
how to adjust
our current situation.

577
00:24:34,821 --> 00:24:36,083
I'm getting the sense

578
00:24:36,126 --> 00:24:38,215
you're not a fan of things
you can't calculate.

579
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:39,932
I'm starting to see
why you spend all your time

580
00:24:39,956 --> 00:24:42,089
around plants.

581
00:24:50,184 --> 00:24:51,968
Shit.

582
00:24:52,012 --> 00:24:54,188
How do the Circumstances
keep changing?

583
00:24:54,231 --> 00:24:56,103
Look, what do you say
we forget the note,

584
00:24:56,146 --> 00:24:58,975
take down those wards,
and go find the Dean ourselves?

585
00:24:59,019 --> 00:25:00,847
We can't even cast properly.

586
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:04,546
Undoing a spell doesn't
require the same rigor.

587
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:08,115
It's like pulling up a weed
with a deep taproot.

588
00:25:08,158 --> 00:25:12,162
Just need to get under it
at the right point, and...

589
00:25:13,903 --> 00:25:15,514
Voilà.

590
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:24,131
Okay.

591
00:25:24,174 --> 00:25:27,221
Okay, maybe I'm just paying
for that botanist's confidence.

592
00:25:27,264 --> 00:25:28,938
I don't think
I should try a healing spell.

593
00:25:28,962 --> 00:25:30,069
I think it might
make things worse.

594
00:25:30,093 --> 00:25:31,573
Infirmary?

595
00:25:31,617 --> 00:25:33,053
That's all the way
across campus.

596
00:25:33,096 --> 00:25:36,099
Okay, um, can we make it
to the greenhouse?

597
00:25:36,143 --> 00:25:39,146
There might be something there
I can use.

598
00:25:44,151 --> 00:25:46,849
They were just here.

599
00:25:46,893 --> 00:25:48,721
Someone must've warned them.

600
00:25:50,766 --> 00:25:52,638
Search the tents.

601
00:26:22,058 --> 00:26:23,625
Hey.

602
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:25,758
Didn't you hear the order?
Check the tents.

603
00:26:25,801 --> 00:26:27,977
- Now.
- Okay.

604
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:32,242
Go.

605
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,860
Well, well. Look what I found.

606
00:26:42,296 --> 00:26:43,906
He planted that.

607
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,821
He planted that gold
like a bad cop,

608
00:26:45,865 --> 00:26:48,345
like that show you... like
Vic Mackey on "The Shield."

609
00:26:48,389 --> 00:26:52,001
You were lecturing me
on the true nature of fairies?

610
00:26:52,045 --> 00:26:54,134
They've changed,

611
00:26:54,177 --> 00:26:55,875
it would appear.

612
00:26:58,051 --> 00:27:02,882
Janet of House Pluchinsky,
what are you doing here?

613
00:27:02,925 --> 00:27:04,250
Been with you guys
the whole time.

614
00:27:04,274 --> 00:27:05,711
Jesus.

615
00:27:05,754 --> 00:27:08,801
Women are just invisible
to you, aren't they, sir?

616
00:27:08,844 --> 00:27:10,716
Congratulations, Bick.

617
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:13,109
Now, shouldn't we get this gold
back to our king

618
00:27:13,153 --> 00:27:15,677
as soon as possible?

619
00:27:15,721 --> 00:27:18,375
We'll hunt the fairies down
another day

620
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:21,030
and no doubt find more gold.

621
00:27:21,074 --> 00:27:23,946
Centurions, back to Whitespire.

622
00:27:26,732 --> 00:27:29,299
- Thanks for the heads up.
- You're welcome.

623
00:27:43,923 --> 00:27:45,054
- Careful.
- Oh, Jesus.

624
00:27:45,098 --> 00:27:46,099
Land mines.

625
00:27:50,407 --> 00:27:52,627
Oh. Hey, guys.

626
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,804
Um, aren't you supposed
to be on lockdown?

627
00:27:55,848 --> 00:27:58,111
- Wanted to help.
- What you up to?

628
00:27:58,154 --> 00:27:59,939
Ah, nothing.

629
00:27:59,982 --> 00:28:02,115
Just, like, getting supplies.

630
00:28:02,158 --> 00:28:04,987
- That's cinnabar.
- That shit's pretty toxic.

631
00:28:05,031 --> 00:28:06,075
- Mm-hmm.
- No.

632
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:09,339
This is, um, cinna... mon.

633
00:28:09,383 --> 00:28:10,819
Cinnamon?

634
00:28:10,863 --> 00:28:14,431
How's cinnamon gonna help
with the security system?

635
00:28:14,475 --> 00:28:16,085
Dean Fogg asked if I could...

636
00:28:16,129 --> 00:28:18,218
Why you acting so squirrely?

637
00:28:18,261 --> 00:28:19,828
Why are you acting so squirrely?

638
00:28:19,872 --> 00:28:22,135
I always act this way, okay?

639
00:28:22,178 --> 00:28:23,658
You know, whatever.

640
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:27,749
I have to get this for Fogg...
To Fogg, because of the...

641
00:28:27,793 --> 00:28:29,316
For his toast, I don't know.

642
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:31,666
- Wait, careful!
- There are land mines.

643
00:28:32,841 --> 00:28:34,103
Thank you.

644
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:38,064
Holy shit!

645
00:28:42,155 --> 00:28:43,983
Oh, my God.

646
00:28:44,026 --> 00:28:46,376
Did I just die?

647
00:28:54,645 --> 00:28:55,908
Here.

648
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:02,175
You see anything we can use
for an antidote?

649
00:29:02,218 --> 00:29:04,438
Is there a section
for healing herbs?

650
00:29:04,481 --> 00:29:05,874
Uh...

651
00:29:05,918 --> 00:29:08,529
Look for variants
of plantago lanceolata.

652
00:29:08,572 --> 00:29:09,573
Okay.

653
00:29:11,575 --> 00:29:12,925
Hey, I found it.

654
00:29:12,968 --> 00:29:15,797
Okay, you need to make
a poultice from the leaves.

655
00:29:22,935 --> 00:29:24,806
That blossom...

656
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,721
it's from a different world.

657
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,418
It shouldn't even
be able to grow here.

658
00:29:28,462 --> 00:29:29,593
Why not?

659
00:29:29,637 --> 00:29:31,813
Different Circumstances.

660
00:29:33,293 --> 00:29:36,470
Everyone thought she'd died
before she cracked it.

661
00:29:36,513 --> 00:29:38,167
What are you talking about?

662
00:29:38,211 --> 00:29:40,953
Ahh.

663
00:29:40,996 --> 00:29:43,390
Your late Exo-Botony professor
was working on

664
00:29:43,433 --> 00:29:46,872
a sort of terrarium
for magical plants.

665
00:29:46,915 --> 00:29:48,525
They don't need
just water or light.

666
00:29:48,569 --> 00:29:51,485
They require specific
Circumstances to survive.

667
00:29:54,314 --> 00:29:56,403
That's to make
the Circumstances match

668
00:29:56,446 --> 00:29:58,405
to any growing conditions.

669
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:01,495
Moon, body of water, altitude.

670
00:30:01,538 --> 00:30:02,844
Holy shit. I think you're right.

671
00:30:02,888 --> 00:30:04,454
Mm.

672
00:30:04,498 --> 00:30:05,954
- Wait, wait, wait!
- You might kill the flower.

673
00:30:05,978 --> 00:30:08,284
Yeah, or find the fix for magic.

674
00:30:32,439 --> 00:30:33,614
Wow. That actually worked.

675
00:30:33,657 --> 00:30:35,790
Just shut up for a second.

676
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,357
What is it?

677
00:30:38,401 --> 00:30:41,361
If Fogg gets my note,

678
00:30:41,404 --> 00:30:44,320
I might actually be able
to fix this mess.

679
00:30:44,364 --> 00:30:48,542
So other Todd tied you up
and locked you in a closet?

680
00:30:48,585 --> 00:30:51,240
Yeah, but I've never
been great with knots,

681
00:30:51,284 --> 00:30:53,982
so it was pretty easy
for me to escape.

682
00:30:54,026 --> 00:30:57,899
Only question is,
why would evil twin me

683
00:30:57,943 --> 00:31:00,641
wanna get rid of me
in the first place?

684
00:31:00,684 --> 00:31:02,991
Of course.

685
00:31:03,035 --> 00:31:04,558
"Evil."

686
00:31:04,601 --> 00:31:05,994
He wasn't your twin.

687
00:31:06,038 --> 00:31:07,561
I think he's from
another timeline.

688
00:31:07,604 --> 00:31:09,824
- Wait, for realsies?
- No, it... it adds up.

689
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,826
You know,
the two Todds plus cinnabar,

690
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,568
which last time I saw,
was being used for time magic.

691
00:31:14,611 --> 00:31:17,005
I always wanted to meet
someone from another timeline.

692
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:18,267
Wait a minute, guys.

693
00:31:18,311 --> 00:31:22,010
What if Dean Fogg
isn't our Fogg?

694
00:31:22,054 --> 00:31:23,882
- Describe him.
- I transcribed his memoir.

695
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:25,405
I know all 40 Foggs.

696
00:31:25,448 --> 00:31:26,686
Even got nicknames
for some of them.

697
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,408
Fedora Fogg,

698
00:31:28,451 --> 00:31:30,497
Cocaine Fogg, Swinger Fogg...

699
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,716
Actually, those last two
are the same Fogg.

700
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,936
Uh, well, this one's
a heavy drinker.

701
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,435
No, that doesn't really
narrow it down.

702
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:37,523
- Okay.
- He has burns on his hands.

703
00:31:37,547 --> 00:31:39,375
He calls you...
Other you "Eliot."

704
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:41,290
- He has...
- Ohh.

705
00:31:41,334 --> 00:31:42,726
Poop.

706
00:31:43,684 --> 00:31:44,685
What?

707
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,949
I call that one Psycho Fogg.

708
00:31:47,993 --> 00:31:51,648
See, in timeline 17,
Brakebills kinda blew up.

709
00:31:51,692 --> 00:31:53,389
Killed almost everybody.

710
00:31:53,433 --> 00:31:55,478
And those burns
on Fogg's hands...

711
00:31:55,522 --> 00:31:57,698
They're kinda 'cause
he's the one who did it.

712
00:31:57,741 --> 00:31:59,023
Well, what would
he be doing here?

713
00:31:59,047 --> 00:32:00,527
Psycho Fogg?

714
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:02,442
Let's not wait
to find out, okay?

715
00:32:02,485 --> 00:32:04,444
- Let's go.
- Ah, okay.

716
00:32:09,362 --> 00:32:11,016
Just over six pounds.

717
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:13,453
Enough to mollify
the soldiers and workers

718
00:32:13,496 --> 00:32:15,324
for tonight, at least.

719
00:32:15,368 --> 00:32:16,978
You're confident
you can retrieve more?

720
00:32:17,022 --> 00:32:19,459
No, sire.

721
00:32:19,502 --> 00:32:22,027
Certain.

722
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:24,638
Ugh.

723
00:32:24,681 --> 00:32:26,422
Mm.

724
00:32:26,466 --> 00:32:29,860
Smells like... shit.

725
00:32:31,471 --> 00:32:33,014
I don't control
where the fairies hide

726
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:34,648
their stolen wealth.

727
00:32:34,691 --> 00:32:37,433
Well, as long
as it pays like gold.

728
00:33:08,073 --> 00:33:10,640
This scalawag is so Vic Mackey.

729
00:33:10,684 --> 00:33:12,860
Gold-shitting beetles.

730
00:33:12,903 --> 00:33:16,516
Everybody said they've been
extinct for hundreds of years.

731
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:17,972
A rumor started
by the Pickwicks, I bet.

732
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,432
Hmm.

733
00:33:19,475 --> 00:33:21,695
I think we're looking
at a little family secret.

734
00:33:24,524 --> 00:33:26,874
Thank God
I got your note in time.

735
00:33:26,917 --> 00:33:28,634
I think we might be able
to actually shut down

736
00:33:28,658 --> 00:33:30,399
this goddamn security system.

737
00:33:30,443 --> 00:33:32,880
If I'm right, this should
adjust Circumstances

738
00:33:32,923 --> 00:33:35,056
in the entire greenhouse,

739
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,971
allowing us to cast.

740
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,104
Let's test it first, shall we?

741
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,458
Not bad, Quinn.

742
00:33:45,501 --> 00:33:47,895
- Can we fix the lockdown now?
- I think so.

743
00:33:47,938 --> 00:33:50,071
I just need one last thing
from Todd.

744
00:33:50,115 --> 00:33:52,769
- Cinnabar, right?
- Todd couldn't make it.

745
00:33:52,813 --> 00:33:55,468
Sorry.

746
00:33:55,511 --> 00:33:57,948
- What's going on?
- Fogg's not who he says he is.

747
00:33:57,992 --> 00:33:59,559
So who is he?

748
00:33:59,602 --> 00:34:01,082
He's Dean Fogg from timeline 17.

749
00:34:01,126 --> 00:34:02,997
Lockdown wasn't an accident,
was it?

750
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,172
You made it happen.

751
00:34:04,216 --> 00:34:05,826
Perhaps I did.

752
00:34:05,869 --> 00:34:07,654
Ah!

753
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:11,571
Take one more step,

754
00:34:11,614 --> 00:34:13,573
and I will hurt them.

755
00:34:13,616 --> 00:34:16,532
Now, please.

756
00:34:16,576 --> 00:34:18,621
Hand me the cinnabar.

757
00:34:18,665 --> 00:34:20,014
What are you gonna do with it?

758
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,538
I'm going to fix things.

759
00:34:22,582 --> 00:34:23,974
I've seen that thing before.

760
00:34:24,018 --> 00:34:25,585
That's the device Stoppard built

761
00:34:25,628 --> 00:34:26,847
to travel between timelines.

762
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:29,545
Yes, I took it from him
to get here,

763
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:31,243
then made a few modifications.

764
00:34:31,286 --> 00:34:33,680
Enough to take
all of Brakebills back home

765
00:34:33,723 --> 00:34:36,074
with me.

766
00:34:41,253 --> 00:34:43,124
Whoa, listen. Hey.

767
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:44,386
Look, I get it.

768
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:46,997
My timeline was a mess also,

769
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:50,479
but you have a Brakebills here
with no Fogg.

770
00:34:50,523 --> 00:34:52,220
Why don't you just stay?

771
00:34:55,484 --> 00:34:57,965
Penny. Sure.

772
00:34:58,008 --> 00:34:59,358
When things start go wrong,

773
00:34:59,401 --> 00:35:01,577
just fuck off
to the next timeline.

774
00:35:01,621 --> 00:35:03,405
How very appropriate.

775
00:35:03,449 --> 00:35:06,321
But didn't you destroy your
Brakebills, and everyone died?

776
00:35:06,365 --> 00:35:08,628
Yes, a measure I took
to try to contain

777
00:35:08,671 --> 00:35:11,326
the damage The Beast could do.

778
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:13,023
And when that failed,

779
00:35:13,067 --> 00:35:15,504
Jane Chatwin got to go
to the next time loop

780
00:35:15,548 --> 00:35:17,202
while I had to stay behind

781
00:35:17,245 --> 00:35:19,769
and live with
the goddamn consequences.

782
00:35:19,813 --> 00:35:22,685
Your timeline continued
even though Jane reset it?

783
00:35:22,729 --> 00:35:24,078
Yes, dear.

784
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,167
Were you dropped on your head
in this timeline?

785
00:35:26,211 --> 00:35:29,431
You should be well familiar
with the multiverse hypothesis.

786
00:35:29,475 --> 00:35:31,041
As it turns out,

787
00:35:31,085 --> 00:35:33,435
one of the goddamn consequences
is I discovered

788
00:35:33,479 --> 00:35:35,742
I have a grown daughter
currently living

789
00:35:35,785 --> 00:35:38,658
in my post-apocalyptic
shitshow of a timeline

790
00:35:38,701 --> 00:35:41,443
with hardly any living
Magicians and no resources.

791
00:35:41,487 --> 00:35:44,011
I need this Brakebills

792
00:35:44,054 --> 00:35:46,622
and everyone in it
to fix where I came from.

793
00:35:46,666 --> 00:35:51,018
You cannot uproot
everyone in this timeline

794
00:35:51,061 --> 00:35:52,585
just to be a good dad, okay?

795
00:35:52,628 --> 00:35:55,196
Watch me.

796
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,807
Fucking father of the year!

797
00:35:57,851 --> 00:36:00,810
Penny, if you're smart,

798
00:36:00,854 --> 00:36:04,640
you will hand me that cinnabar
and join me.

799
00:36:04,684 --> 00:36:06,642
Doesn't sound too smart to me.

800
00:36:06,686 --> 00:36:10,037
Well, you can't travel
anymore, yes?

801
00:36:11,256 --> 00:36:12,692
I know a psychic in my timeline

802
00:36:12,735 --> 00:36:14,084
who might be able to fix you.

803
00:36:14,128 --> 00:36:17,566
Her specialty is unlocking
latent abilities.

804
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:19,786
She's done extensive studies
on travelers.

805
00:36:19,829 --> 00:36:22,528
And I'm fucking her.

806
00:36:22,571 --> 00:36:23,572
Heh.

807
00:36:27,402 --> 00:36:28,795
Penny.

808
00:36:28,838 --> 00:36:30,840
You're not actually
considering...

809
00:36:30,884 --> 00:36:33,191
And get my GPS fixed?

810
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:35,236
Why not?

811
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,675
Because everyone in this
timeline deserves a Brakebills.

812
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:42,504
Yeah, well,
I'm not from this timeline.

813
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,552
Wait. Dean Fogg, no!

814
00:37:03,612 --> 00:37:06,093
God damn it.

815
00:37:06,136 --> 00:37:07,268
What happened?

816
00:37:07,312 --> 00:37:09,139
That cinnabar we gave you?

817
00:37:09,183 --> 00:37:10,663
We swapped it out for cinnamon.

818
00:37:10,706 --> 00:37:12,795
Doesn't play too nice
with time magic.

819
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:15,233
We actually got the idea
from Todd, uh, before he...

820
00:37:16,669 --> 00:37:19,541
You know what? Never mind.

821
00:37:19,585 --> 00:37:21,848
Now how 'bout you show us
how to lift that lockdown?

822
00:37:25,634 --> 00:37:27,375
The smell is how you knew?

823
00:37:27,419 --> 00:37:30,248
I'd read about the beetles
who excreted gold,

824
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:34,426
but we were all told they
disappeared generations ago.

825
00:37:34,469 --> 00:37:35,731
Surprisingly,

826
00:37:35,775 --> 00:37:39,126
Bick's all about
saving endangered species.

827
00:37:39,169 --> 00:37:42,172
Ridiculous, sire.

828
00:37:42,216 --> 00:37:44,566
Your apartments have
already been searched, Bick.

829
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:47,613
Obviously,
the fairies never had any gold,

830
00:37:47,656 --> 00:37:49,571
and Bick never had any reason
to hate them.

831
00:37:51,486 --> 00:37:53,880
They are not Fillorian.

832
00:37:53,923 --> 00:37:55,403
That's reason enough.

833
00:37:55,447 --> 00:37:58,537
You'd have had their
innocent blood on my hands?

834
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:01,322
What fairy is innocent?

835
00:38:01,366 --> 00:38:04,325
Um, all of them.

836
00:38:05,805 --> 00:38:08,895
Sire, please, please.
Thi... this is outrageous.

837
00:38:08,938 --> 00:38:11,289
Be reasonable!

838
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:13,291
That was satisfying.

839
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:14,727
I'm so sorry.

840
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:15,945
That can't have been easy.

841
00:38:15,989 --> 00:38:18,165
I know how much you trusted him.

842
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:21,690
No, thank you...

843
00:38:21,734 --> 00:38:24,780
for bringing a little honesty
to this castle.

844
00:38:27,827 --> 00:38:31,309
Bick didn't make Seb dark.

845
00:38:31,352 --> 00:38:33,354
He is dark.

846
00:38:33,398 --> 00:38:35,443
I like him, okay?

847
00:38:35,487 --> 00:38:38,185
Maybe I like him because
I hope he's not fucked up.

848
00:38:38,228 --> 00:38:41,667
Maybe I like him
because I hope he is,

849
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:43,799
because I am too.

850
00:38:43,843 --> 00:38:45,627
Maybe all I deserve
is fucked up.

851
00:38:45,671 --> 00:38:47,890
When you think that way,
it's all you'll ever get.

852
00:38:47,934 --> 00:38:49,631
Why do you care so much?

853
00:38:49,675 --> 00:38:52,460
What? I don't.

854
00:38:52,504 --> 00:38:54,244
But what happens to you
happens to me,

855
00:38:54,288 --> 00:38:56,899
and I don't want him
happening to me.

856
00:38:58,423 --> 00:39:00,425
I know I deserve better.

857
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,212
Wild guess.

858
00:39:05,255 --> 00:39:09,347
Your mother and your father
both loved you unconditionally.

859
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,740
- How did you know?
- How could I not?

860
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:19,313
What did you do with Fogg 17?

861
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,797
Can't arrest him,
can't let him go,

862
00:39:20,836 --> 00:39:22,229
so we put him in the Clean Room.

863
00:39:22,272 --> 00:39:24,884
He can't cast there,
so at least this way,

864
00:39:24,927 --> 00:39:27,234
if there's something else
that goes wrong at Brakebills,

865
00:39:27,277 --> 00:39:29,236
there's a Fogg
I can talk to about it.

866
00:39:29,279 --> 00:39:31,281
There's one thing
I'm certain of.

867
00:39:31,325 --> 00:39:34,981
Things are absolutely
going to keep going wrong here.

868
00:39:35,024 --> 00:39:37,679
I have a theory why magic
isn't working right.

869
00:39:37,723 --> 00:39:39,377
I've been studying
the control panel,

870
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:42,031
and there's a readout
on prevailing Circumstances

871
00:39:42,075 --> 00:39:43,468
outside the tank, and...

872
00:39:43,511 --> 00:39:46,253
well, the moon
was all over the place.

873
00:39:46,296 --> 00:39:48,124
- I don't understand.
- I thought...

874
00:39:48,168 --> 00:39:50,126
I mean, when we fixed the moon,

875
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:51,452
it was like
we never even broke it.

876
00:39:51,476 --> 00:39:53,347
I think the Lunatics were right

877
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,741
and the moon's got feelings,
and apparently,

878
00:39:55,784 --> 00:39:57,960
she's pissed at us.

879
00:39:58,004 --> 00:40:00,093
Great. How do we fix that?

880
00:40:02,312 --> 00:40:04,227
I have no idea,
so I'm just gonna

881
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:06,752
keep studying the control panel
at the green house

882
00:40:06,795 --> 00:40:10,364
and see what solution
I can come up with.

883
00:40:11,234 --> 00:40:12,453
Thank you.

884
00:40:12,497 --> 00:40:13,933
Oh, speaking of,

885
00:40:13,976 --> 00:40:16,457
I hear your botanist friend
is doing better.

886
00:40:16,501 --> 00:40:19,504
Not my friend,
just somebody I helped out.

887
00:40:19,547 --> 00:40:22,245
Okay, well, the hiring
committee gave him an offer,

888
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:25,771
so you might run into him
in Botany Bay.

889
00:40:25,814 --> 00:40:27,773
Oh.

890
00:40:27,816 --> 00:40:29,427
Fucking great.

891
00:40:32,865 --> 00:40:36,259
Yeah, I, um...
I should probably go too.

892
00:40:36,303 --> 00:40:39,001
Yeah.

893
00:40:39,045 --> 00:40:40,220
Still going to Fillory?

894
00:40:41,351 --> 00:40:43,266
Somebody's gotta
stop the apocalypse.

895
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:45,225
And it's gotta be you.

896
00:40:45,268 --> 00:40:46,879
Penny.

897
00:40:46,922 --> 00:40:48,358
Just...

898
00:40:51,536 --> 00:40:53,363
In my timeline,

899
00:40:53,407 --> 00:40:55,235
I let you go on a quest
to Fillory without me,

900
00:40:55,278 --> 00:40:56,845
and you never came back.

901
00:40:58,412 --> 00:41:00,283
I'm not that Julia.

902
00:41:00,327 --> 00:41:02,068
I... I know, I'm not...

903
00:41:02,111 --> 00:41:04,897
I didn't just come here
and swap Julias, that's...

904
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,115
You're totally different.

905
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:08,074
Christ, you have no idea.

906
00:41:08,117 --> 00:41:09,486
The only thing you
for sure have in common

907
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:11,033
is I could not stop her

908
00:41:11,077 --> 00:41:13,471
when she set her mind
to something either.

909
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,433
I have to do this, Penny.

910
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,916
I know.

911
00:41:23,959 --> 00:41:26,962
I just can't go through
that again.

912
00:41:30,096 --> 00:41:31,967
And so here we are.

913
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,971
Here we are.

914
00:41:37,973 --> 00:41:40,236
Be safe, Julia.

915
00:41:41,934 --> 00:41:43,326
Yeah.

916
00:41:55,034 --> 00:41:58,428
As I told Margo,
we are deeply grateful.

917
00:41:58,472 --> 00:42:01,519
You risked everything for us.

918
00:42:01,562 --> 00:42:04,130
The least we can do
is to show you the truth.

919
00:42:05,305 --> 00:42:07,002
This way.

920
00:44:01,116 --> 00:44:02,116
- Remember?
- Mm.
