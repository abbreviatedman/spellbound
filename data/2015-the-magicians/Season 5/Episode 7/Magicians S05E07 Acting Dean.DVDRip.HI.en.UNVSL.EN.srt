A league of mischief makers
with a taste for high-end graphite.

172
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:07,644
So we tried to cast a cleansing
spell and instead it made live chickens.

173
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:11,451
So many chickens.

174
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:17,688
So, apparently the fertility and
contraception charms got switched,

175
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:20,665
so, um, we have
a bit of a situation.

176
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:24,669
They're special because of
their smear resistance and...

177
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:28,651
I don't think you're
taking me very seriously.

178
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,371
I promise you I am not.

179
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:32,969
All the air in there
just turned to water.

180
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,208
I shouldn't have to be able
to swim to take astronomy.

181

(KNOCKING ON DOOR) Go away.

182
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,283
ALICE: We really
did it this time, huh.

183
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,286
Zelda warned us it would happen.

184
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,689
We changed the Circumstances
of the moon for good.

185
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:51,389
What do we do? (SIGHS)
We try to live with what we did.

186
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:53,694
Back to basics.

187
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:56,603
Figure out how to
cast again. Magic 101.

188
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:59,605
It's why I'm here. But we
have to figure it out fast.

189
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,299
We stopped the
Harmonic Convergence,

190
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,774
but there's still
too much magic.

191
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:06,404
Right. (SCOFFS)
And if a surge happens,

192
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:11,247
every spell already jacked is
gonna get re-amped up to 11.

193
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:13,244
Christ!

194
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:16,084
It's too bad Fogg was
sober when he left.

195
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:23,057
What is it? I don't know.

196
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,757
But I'd say this is an
emergency, wouldn't you?

197
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:32,498
"For emergencies only."
That's not ominous at all.

198
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,805
Based on the locator spells on it,
we thought maybe it was built to...

199
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:38,343
To summon Fogg.

200
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,332
Think it could reach
the Etheric Realm?

201
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:41,957
I mean, Kady
said he can't leave,

202
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,950
but maybe we could
get a message out.

203
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:46,253
ALICE: Even if we
could get it to reach Fogg,

204
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,981
using any magic right now
could backfire, like it did to Lipson.

205
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,252
Look, students are
in actual danger.

206
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:55,385
This campus is going haywire. No
one knows when the next surge'll hit,

207
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:57,658
and I have no idea how to help.

208
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,699
I hate to admit it, but I
think Fogg was doing

209
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,428
way more work than
we gave him credit for.

210
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:02,534
We need him back.

211
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,003
And if this thing can
at least contact him...

212
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,385
Sounds like it's worth the risk.

213
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,740
Okay.

214
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:10,468
Whew!

00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,174
What the hell, Julia?

218
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,943
I'm fine. Did it work?

219
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,797
It's probably broken like
everything else in this school.

(WHISPERING) Jesus.
Hi. Where have you been?

224
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:40,439
Well, I have to sleep sometimes.

225
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:42,267
And everything you
do isn't that interesting.

226
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:45,735
I think, whatever I miss, I'll
just find in your brain later.

227
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,475
What do you people call
it? Um, binge-watching?

229
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:52,118
The best and
swiftest way to get it...

230
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:53,653
To get what? Your Majesty.

231
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:56,984
Gold. Our reserves are depleted.

232
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:59,821
The salaries of our
soldiers and barrier builders

233
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:02,658
haven't been paid in weeks,
and both are threatening to strike.

234
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:06,130
The slightest work stoppage
could imperil all of us.

235
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,869
As reports indicate,

236
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,436
the Takers are
gathering in force.

237
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:16,074
Which is why I must lead a cohort of
Centurions into the Windward Woods,

238
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:19,340
and find the gold the
Fairies steal and hoard.

239
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,172
Okay, but that
really doesn't track.

240
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:26,519
Fairies are into
mushrooms and milk baths.

241
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,553
You have experience with them?

242
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:30,315
I do, sire.

243
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,256
Mostly bad, right?
According to your memory.

244
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,385
Then you know that they're as
untrustworthy as they are greedy.

245
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:39,027
They have purloined our
citizens' gold for years.

246
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,993
My men and I will get it back.

247
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,662
If I may, Your Majesty.

248
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,170
I do have experience
with Fairies,

249
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:47,730
and while they are
crafty negotiators,

250
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,672
they're not thieves.

251
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,270
If they have our citizens' gold,

252
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:57,475
perhaps it's from a misunderstanding
that can be worked out diplomatically.

253
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,917
Payments are due no
later than tomorrow's sunset.

254
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,078
I'm quite aware.

255
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:03,179
And diplomacy...

256
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:05,555

be followed by force.

257

to earth. That's true.

We need five pounds of gold by
tomorrow, and another 15 by the week's end.

265

Or the life of every
Fillorian is in peril.

266
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,613
Accompany Pickwick.

267
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:35,746
If you find the
Fairies' encampment,

268
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,517
you have one hour to negotiate.

269
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:39,556
If that fails,

270
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:44,060
you'll stand down and let the
Centurions do whatever is necessary.

271
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,961
I trust your wisdom, sire.

272
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,475
Whoa. Hey, easy.

273
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,073
I'm High King Margo. We
were all pals back in the day.

274
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,044
Oh, we know who you are.

275
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,349
Look. My friend was
supposed to find you.

276
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,630
I think we can help each other.

277
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:08,654
WOMAN: Margo?

278
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,615
It's okay, Rowan. She's with me.

279
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:20,932
Ugh.

280
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,897
If that's from the selkie
in the east fountain,

281
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,735
you might want to
get tested for the clap.

282
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,332
Holy shit, am I glad to see you.

283
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:30,819
How'd you get out
of the Etheric Realm?

284
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,072
Long story.

285
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,537
Point is, I heard your call.

286
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:38,516
I'm here, and yes, I could
use a goddamn drink.

287
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,112
Weren't you sober?

288
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:44,087
Ah. Yes, right.

289
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:47,321
Well, the Etheric
Realm was a lot.

290
00:13:47,794 --> 00:13:48,794
(CHUCKLES)

291
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,932
Let's find a bottle
and you can fill me in.

292
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:55,958
Okay.

293
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:06,341
The Traveler Professor who
cannot travel is now the Acting Dean.

294
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,145
Students are blowing
themselves up,

295
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:15,212
and I presume you are the aforementioned
assholes who moved the moon.

296
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,687
Yes, but I found a workaround.

297
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:21,556
If you cast as if your
altitude's is 1,000 feet lower

298
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:25,996
and the Pleiades are six degrees
further to the north, well, then...

299
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:29,501
Huh.

300
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,831
If we apply this
tweak to every spell,

301
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:37,036
we can teach people to cast without
exploding or turning things into chickens.

302
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,330
PENNY: What
happened to your hand?

303
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,145
I thought the Etheric Realm
was supposed to be a fun trip.

304
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:43,906
Yes.

305
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:47,581
Leaving it, less so.
But I had no choice.

306
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:51,622
I couldn't risk anyone else getting
hurt by the security system I built.

307
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:55,459
Yes, I can deactivate it,

308
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,156
and I will need the
master key, please.

309
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,096
Thank you. Oh, hold up, hold up.

310
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:05,035
I've still got student
problems to put on your radar.

311
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,869
Penny, I have to go
save hundreds of lives.

312
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,375
I think you can handle
a few whiny students.

313
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:13,913
See? Delegating.

314
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:18,013
MARGO: Look, we got
a common enemy here.

315
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,849
The Dark King's goons are
itching to make your life hell.

316
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,786
We've always dealt
with hostile humans.

317
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,621
Yeah, well, this one's got
an army. In which you serve.

318
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:28,786
I'm undercover so I can
get information on him.

319
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:30,906
Which we could be sharing
with each other right now,

320
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,092
if you'd just set your
motherfucker to receive.

321
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,430
FEN: Okay, let's
dial it down, guys.

322
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:36,969
We're all friends here.

323
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:38,264
Forgive my bluntness, Fen,

324
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:41,773
but your choice of friends
makes me doubt our choice of ally.

325
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:43,521
Maybe you're too young
or dumb to remember,

326
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:45,670
but I'm the king who made
peace with your people.

327
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,222
Is that what you think you did?

328
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:48,246
Yeah.

329
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,449
Rowan, wait.

330
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,451
Okay. What does she think I did?

331
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,786
Well, very few Fairies who
knew you are still alive today,

332
00:15:57,857 --> 00:16:01,259
and the rest just know the
story of High King Margo,

333
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:05,264
which, over the centuries,
shifted with each retelling.

334
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:08,499
So I'm being boned by a
giant game of telephone.

335
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:11,332
No, no, no. Phone games
are fun. This, not so much.

336
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:14,669
See, you say you made peace.

337
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:19,069
They say you destroyed their realm
and allowed Fairy hunts for sport.

338
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,114
It's a real potato, potato.

339
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,775
No, it's potato,
po-massive fucking lie.

340
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,718
Look, I found them,
gained their trust.

341
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:29,152
You think that was
easy for me after...

342
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:31,456
what happened to my baby?

343
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:33,024
But I did it.

344
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,726
And then you barrel in

345
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,659
and just completely
screw the pooch.

346
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,630
And not in a good way. Okay.

347
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,291
You know what? You're right.

348
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,131
I... Uh...

349
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:45,701
Yeah, I am.

350
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,837
And now the Fairies
need to trust us both.

351
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:51,471
How can I help make that happen?

352
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,138
You won't like it.

353
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,455
MAN: Uh, that's not right.

354
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,519
I know what I'm
doing, if you don't mind.

355
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:11,397
It's a mistake. For sure.

356
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:15,595
I'm correcting spells for the
new Circumstances. It's math.

357
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,135
I don't make mistakes at math.

358
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:22,933
No, I mean that is a spell
for cooking without a fire,

359
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,570
but for real, that's gonna
be a pretty terrible steak.

360
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,911
You need flame to
denature the proteins.

361
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:31,076
What do I know, though?

362
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,350
You a teacher here?
We could be colleagues.

363
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,945
I'm interviewing
for the botany job.

364
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:38,254
Hamish Bax.

365
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:40,920
Alice Quinn.

366
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:44,957
Not related to Stephanie
Quinn, are you?

367
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,726
We met at a rare flower expo.

368
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:52,505
I found her orchid
quite impressive.

369
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:54,634
Oh, God.

370
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,906
Uh, no, no, nothing like that.

371
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:59,104
I would never date
another botanist.

372
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:02,574
(SLOSHES)

373
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:04,917
Wait. Shit.

374
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:08,251
I don't understand.
My fix was working.

375
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:09,621
Ugh.

376
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:11,816
PENNY: <i>According
to Todd's napkins,</i>

377
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,450
there are evil forces

378
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,292
coming from a
distant realm to invade.

379
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:20,461
You think this is
enough to go on?

380
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,134
Oh, Fillory was overrun by these
Taker creatures, so it's gotta be them.

381
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:25,937
So you're going.

382
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:29,404
We could use your
help. I could use yours.

383
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:32,743
Fogg's back.

384
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,112
You didn't even want
to be a professor.

385
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,694
We're talking about the
fate of an entire world.

386
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:40,016
Didn't we just do this, though?

387
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,150
One minute it's the
Harmonic Convergence,

388
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,156
then it's the moon
and now Fillory?

389
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,559
Can't we just... What?
Sit back and relax?

390
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:49,586
No, but... (SIGHS)
Come on, Penny.

391
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:50,960
Look, you know what I'm after.

392
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:55,333
A life. With you, here,
or wherever, honestly.

393
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:56,458
Why not Fillory?

394
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:59,095
Because not every
apocalypse is our problem.

395
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:02,201
We just survived
the last one by a hair,

396
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,952
and what is it all for
if we can't kick back

397
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,410
on a beach
somewhere and enjoy it?

398
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,207
Let me tell you something.

399
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:10,139
The world doesn't wait
for timing to be right.

400
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,943
I want to know how
long I've gotta wait.

401
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,683
You live to 35, and
then you get to be done?

402
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,522
Or is this forever?

403
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:23,639
I get you need magic
to mean something, but...

404
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,131
Oh, I see what this is.

405
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,024
You think it's some irrational
reaction to my best friend dying,

406
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:29,625
and eventually
I'll just get over it?

407
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,666
Well, your math
was right before.

408
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:35,503
Okay, but it's
definitely not now.

409
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:38,969
I don't know why, but I think the
Circumstances just changed again.

410
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,780
Oh, shit. I told
Fogg it was safe.

411
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,611
If he tries to use my
fix and it backfires...

412
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,345
I have to warn him,

413
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:47,977
<i>before he tries to disable
the security system.</i>

00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,622

I'm not judging you.</i>

You're allowed to

00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:02,667
Thank you for your permission.

417
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,534
Yeah, but the shit
you do affects me, too.

418
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,071
I think I can't do
what I need to do

419
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:08,232
if I'm worried about
how it's gonna affect you.

me? I'm worried about you.</i>

PENNY: <i>So, what are you saying?</i>

423
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,415

Looks like you're not
going to Fillory after all.

434
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:05,495
Look, I really thought I
was doing the right thing.

435
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,123
By robbing us of our homeland?

436
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:08,292
By giving you a place

437
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,562
where you and your weird
mushroom eggs could survive.

438
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:13,765
FAIRY QUEEN: You promised
sanctuary and left us vulnerable.

439
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,299
When your people persecuted us

440
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:18,809
because we had no
way to defend ourselves.

441
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:20,243
You abandoned us.

442
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:25,483
And you can understand how
that would make the Fairies feel,

443
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:26,711
can't you, Margo?

444
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:29,421
Okay, yeah. Of course I'm
sorry you went through that.

445
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:31,469
But it was after my reign ended.

446
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:34,489
You really think that justifies
the harm you set into motion?

447
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:38,723
Jesus. You step out
for 300 goddamn years

448
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,962
and a bunch of gossip girls turn your
whole life into the Nuremberg trials?

00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,160
Margo.

450
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:45,534
Look, this diplomatic
milk bath is all very kabuki,

451
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:48,369
but let me tell you what
my dad always said.

452
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:50,671
"You can't fix stupid."

453
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:53,302
Skipping past the fact he
always said it to me, I'll add,

454
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,342
I'm not the problem here.

455
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:57,973
And if you don't work with me
to bring down the Dark King,

456

Olympic-gold-medal stupid.

down the security system,

it set off all the school's

And you can't shut
it down? I'm trying.

you stay put so you don't get blown up,

Yes, I know what
we need. Let's go.

Yes. Of course.

JULIA: Wait. Todd, I just...

483
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,185
I had a quick question about
something the Pig Man said.

484
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:08,419
Of course. Yeah.

485
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,716
(STUTTERS) Which
professor's Pig Man?

486
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:15,156
The Pig Man. From Fillory.

00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,825
What about him? DEAN: Todd!

488
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,422
Sorry. Gotta bounce.

489
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,532
You saw that, right?

490
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:27,368
He had no clue what
I was talking about.

491
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:29,874
It's Todd. He's always clueless.

492
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,044
No, I'm telling you.
Something's up.

493
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:35,274
Fogg's acting off, too, right?

494
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,376
The drinking? The
burns on his hands?

495
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:40,964
I just figured the Etheric
Realm did a number on him.

496
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,846
And you saw what Todd
was carrying, too, right?

497
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:47,955
I mean, Azurite. Bondoc
Prisms, beech ash.

498
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,559
That's all reserved
for Major Arcana.

499
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:55,067
Or they could just be trying
to fix the security spells.

500
00:23:56,502 --> 00:23:57,502
We should follow them.

501
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:00,664
And get turned into
centipedes or whatever?

502
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:01,973
No thanks.

503
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:05,235
Also, no offense, rather
not be around you right now.

504
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:08,813
What? Yeah, cool. Okay, stay
here by yourself. I'm gonna go.

505
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:12,775
And get turned into
a centipede. Fuck.

Well, this is definitely the most
exciting job interview I've ever been on.

00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,258
I don't understand why you're
still hoping to reach Fogg.

508
00:24:22,328 --> 00:24:25,059
He clearly tried your
casting tweak and it backfired.

509
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:27,191
Why we're trapped in
here in the first place.

510
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:28,632
If he's trying to fix it,

511
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:31,330
he'll need to understand how
to adjust to our current situation.

512
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:34,635
Getting the sense you're not a
fan of things you can't calculate.

513
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:37,438
I'm starting to see why you
spend all your time around plants.

stay in place and await...</i>

516
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:47,518
Shit.

517
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,312
How do the Circumstances
keep changing?

518
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,458
Okay, what do you
say we forget the note,

519
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:55,016
take down those wards and
go find the Dean ourselves?

520
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,992
We can't even cast properly.

521
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:59,898
Undoing the spell doesn't
require the same rigor.

522
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:04,033
It's like pulling up a
weed with a deep taproot.

523
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:11,477
Just need to get under it
at the right point, and <i>voilà.</i>

524
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:17,881
(BAX EXCLAIMING)

525
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:23,454
Okay, okay, maybe I'm just
paying for that botanist's confidence.

526
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,166
I don't think I should
try a healing spell.

527
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,659
I think it might make
things worse. The infirmary?

528
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:29,304
It's all the way across campus.

529
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:32,321
Okay, can we make
it to the greenhouse?

530
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:34,365
There might be
something there I can use.

531
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:42,259
BICK: (SIGHS)
They were just here.

532
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:44,738
Someone must have warned them.

533
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,711
Search the tents.

534
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:55,047
MAN 1: Search
here. MAN 2: Clear.

535
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:22,981
Hey. Didn't you hear the
order? Check the tents. Now.

536
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,106
Okay.

537
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,447
JANET: Go.

538
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,919
Well, well. Look what I found.

539
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,430
He planted that.

540
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:43,164
He planted that gold. Like a
bad cop. Like that show you...

541
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,566
Like Vic Mackey on <i>The Shield.</i>

542
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:48,005
You were lecturing me on
the true nature of Fairies?

543
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:51,370
They've changed,
it would appear.

544
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:58,415
Janet of House Pluchinsky,
what are you doing here?

545
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:01,753
I've been with you guys the
whole time. Jesus. (CHUCKLES)

546
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,182
Women are just invisible
to you, aren't they, sir?

547
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:06,286
ELIOT: Congratulations, Bick.

548
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,626
Now, shouldn't we get this gold
back to our king as soon as possible?

549
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:14,195
We'll hunt the Fairies
down another day.

550
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:16,561
And no doubt, find more gold.

551
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,771
Centurions, back to Whitespire.

552
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:25,270
Thanks for the heads-up.
BOTH: You're welcome.

553
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:42,189
Careful. Landmines. Jesus.

554
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,657
Oh! Hey, guys.

555
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:51,894
Um... Aren't you supposed
to be on lockdown?

556
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,530
Wanted to help. What you up to?

557
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:58,303
Ah, nothing. Just,
like, getting supplies.

558
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:01,045
That's cinnabar.
That shit's pretty toxic.

559
00:28:01,647 --> 00:28:06,676
No. This is cinnamon. Cinnamon?

560
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,879
How's cinnamon gonna
help with the security system?

561
00:28:10,923 --> 00:28:12,789
Dean Fogg asked if I could...

562
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:14,391
Why are you acting so squirrely?

563
00:28:14,493 --> 00:28:15,927
Why are you acting so squirrely?

564
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,724
I always act this way, okay?

565
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:22,499
You know, whatever. I have
to get this for Fogg. To Fogg.

566
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,531
Because of the... For
his toast. I don't know.

567
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,572
Wait. Careful.
There are landmines.

568
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:30,166
Thank you.

569
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,043
Holy shit.

570
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:42,180

(BAX GROANING)

572
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:58,435
You see anything we
can use for an antidote?

573
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,305
Is there a section
for healing herbs?

ALICE: Uh...

575
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,074
Look for variants of

576
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:06,544
Okay.

577
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,780
Yeah, found it.

578
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:12,544
Okay. You need to make
a poultice from the leaves.

579
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:23,395
That blossom, it's
from a different world.

580
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:26,263
Shouldn't even be able
to grow here. Why not?

581
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,394
Different Circumstances.

582
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:32,063
Everyone thought she
died before she cracked it.

583
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:34,185

(GROANING)

585
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:43,037
Your late exo-botany professor was working
on a sort of terrarium for magical plants.

586
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:45,315
They don't need
just water or light,

587
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:47,943
they require specific
Circumstances to survive.

588
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:54,626
That's to make the Circumstances
match to any growing conditions.

589

Moon, body of water, altitude.

590

find the fix for magic.

What is it?

596
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:36,524
If Fogg gets my note,

597
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:40,164
I might actually be
able to fix this mess.

598

So, other Todd tied you up

599
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:45,410
and locked you in a closet?

600

Yeah, but I've never
been great with knots,

601
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:50,780

for me to escape.

Only question is why
would evil twin me

603
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,315
want to get rid of
me in the first place?

Of course. Evil.

00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,223
He wasn't your twin. I think
he's from another time line.

being used for time magic.

someone from another time line.

Wait a minute, guys. What
if Dean Fogg isn't our Fogg?

612
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:22,006
Describe him. I transcribed
his memoir. I know all 40 Foggs.

613
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,480
Even got nicknames
for some of them.

614
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:27,242
"Fedora Fogg," "Cocaine
Fogg," "Swinger Fogg."

615
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:29,617
Actually, those last
two are the same Fogg.

616
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,690
Well, this one's
a heavy drinker.

617
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:33,134
No, that doesn't
really narrow it down.

618
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:35,992
Okay, he has burns on his hands.
He calls you, other you, "Eliot."

619
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:38,724
He... Oh, poop.

620
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:41,222
What?

621
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,726
I call that one "Psycho Fogg."

622
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:48,468
See, in time line 17,
Brakebills kinda blew up.

623
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,064
Killed almost everybody.

624
00:31:50,175 --> 00:31:52,110
And those burns on Fogg's hands,

625
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,372
they're 'cause he's
the one who did it.

626
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:56,005
Well, what would
he be doing here?

627
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:59,017
Psycho Fogg? Let's
not wait to find out, okay?

628
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:00,881
Let's go. Okay.

629
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:07,754
Just over six pounds.

630
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,058
Enough to mollify the
soldiers and workers

631
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:11,255
for tonight at least.

632
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,758
You're confident you
can retrieve more?

633
00:32:14,566 --> 00:32:17,058
No, sire. Certain.

Smells like shit.

I don't control where the
Fairies hide their stolen wealth.

638
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:33,649

it pays like gold.

Everybody said they've been
extinct for hundreds of years.

642
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:14,987
A rumor started by
the Pickwicks, I bet.

643
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:17,830
I think we're looking
at a little family secret.

644
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,060
DEAN: Thank God I
got your note in time.

645
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:27,002
I think we might able to actually shut
down this goddamn security system.

647
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:30,806
this should adjust Circumstances
in the entire greenhouse.

Allowing us to cast.

Let's test it first, shall we?

650
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,043
Not bad, Quinn.

651
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,581
Can we fix the lockdown
now? DEAN: I think so.

652
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:46,749
I just need one
last thing from Todd.

653
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,385
Cinnabar, right?
Todd couldn't make it.

654
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:51,290
Sorry.

655
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,197
What's going on?

656
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:55,727
Fogg's not who he
says he is. So who is he?

657
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:57,996
He's Dean Fogg
from time line 17.

658
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:00,901
Lockdown wasn't an accident,
was it? You made it happen.

659
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,540
Perhaps I did.

(DEAN 17 GRUNTS)

661
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:09,238
Take one more step
and I will hurt them.

662
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:15,252
Now, please, hand
me the cinnabar.

663
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:18,619
What are you gonna do
with it? I'm going to fix things.

664
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:20,735
PENNY: I've seen
that thing before.

665
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:23,729
That's the device Stoppard
built to travel between time lines.

666
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:28,028
Yes. I took it from him to get
here, then made a few modifications.

667
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:31,627
Enough to take all of
Brakebills back home with me.

668
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:43,815
Whoa. Listen. Hey. Look, I get
it. My time line was a mess also.

669
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:47,747
But you have a Brakebills
here with no Fogg.

670
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,344
Why don't you just stay?

671
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:51,349
(LAUGHS)

672
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:54,656
Penny, sure.

673
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,894
When things start to go wrong,
just fuck off to the next time line.

674
00:34:58,964 --> 00:35:00,592
How very appropriate.

675
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:03,726
But didn't you destroy your
Brakebills and everyone died?

676
00:35:03,802 --> 00:35:07,796
Yes. A measure I took to try to
contain the damage The Beast could do.

677
00:35:08,907 --> 00:35:10,273
And when that failed,

678
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:12,708
Jane Chatwin got to
go to the next time loop,

679
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:17,243
while I had to stay behind and live
with the goddamn consequences.

680
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:20,251
Your time line continued
even though Jane reset it?

681
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:21,318
DEAN 17: Yes, dear.

682
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:23,320
Were you dropped on
your head in this time line?

683
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:26,718
You should be well familiar
with the multiverse hypothesis.

684
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:30,094
As it turns out, one of the
goddamn consequences

685
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:32,187
is I discovered I have
a grown daughter.

686
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:35,965
Currently living in my
post-apocalyptic shitshow of a time line

687
00:35:36,034 --> 00:35:38,731
with hardly any living
Magicians and no resources.

688
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:43,935
I need this Brakebills and everyone
in it to fix where I came from.

689
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:48,436
You cannot uproot
everyone in this time line

690
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:49,776
just to be a good dad, okay?

691
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,148
Watch me.

692
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:54,852
Fucking Father of the Year.

693
00:35:55,987 --> 00:36:01,756
Penny, if you're smart, you will
hand me that cinnabar and join me.

694
00:36:02,427 --> 00:36:03,895
Doesn't sound too smart to me.

695
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:06,991
Well, you can't
travel anymore. Yes?

696
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:11,196
I know a psychic in my time
line who might be able to fix you.

697
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:14,832
Her specialty is
unlocking latent abilities.

698
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:17,068
She's done extensive
studies on Travelers.

699
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:20,808
And I'm fucking her. (CHUCKLES)

700
00:36:24,816 --> 00:36:27,786
Penny, you're not
actually considering...

701
00:36:28,253 --> 00:36:31,189
And get my GPS fixed? Why not?

702
00:36:32,624 --> 00:36:35,526
Because everyone in this
time line deserves a Brakebills.

703
00:36:37,262 --> 00:36:38,822
Yeah, well, I'm not
from this time line.

704
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,092
Wait. Dean Fogg, no!

705
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:54,873
(GROANS)

706
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,419
Damn it. What happened?

707
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:06,390
That cinnabar we gave you?

708
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:07,731
We swapped it out for cinnamon.

709
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,140
Doesn't play too
nice with time magic.

710
00:37:10,195 --> 00:37:12,721
We actually got the idea
from Todd before he...

711
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:15,864
You know what? Never mind.

712
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:19,515
Now, how about you show
us how to lift that lockdown?

713
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:24,752
DARK KING: The
smell is how you knew?

714
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:27,871
I'd read about the
beetles who excreted gold,

715
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:30,733
but we were all told they
disappeared generations ago.

716
00:37:32,117 --> 00:37:36,282
Surprisingly, Bick's all about
saving endangered species.

717
00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:39,283
Ridiculous, sire.

718
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,791
Your apartments have
already been searched, Bick.

719
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:44,962
Obviously, the Fairies
never had any gold,

720
00:37:45,063 --> 00:37:46,861
and Bick never had
any reason to hate them.

721
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:52,426
They are not Fillorian.
That's reason enough.

722
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,733
You'd have had their
innocent blood on my hands?

723
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:58,503
What Fairy is innocent?

724
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,511
Um... All of them.

725
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:06,174
Sire, please. This
is outrageous.

726
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,752
Be reasonable!

727
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:11,516
That was satisfying.
I'm so sorry.

728
00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:13,250
That can't have been easy.

729
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:15,122
I know how much you trusted him.

730
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:17,792
No. Thank you.

731
00:38:19,164 --> 00:38:21,998
For bringing a little
honesty to this castle.

732
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:23,896
(SIGHS)

733
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,898
Bick didn't make Seb dark.

734
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,072
He is dark.

735
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:32,777
I like him, okay? (SIGHS)

736
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:35,541
Maybe I like him because
I hope he's not fucked up.

737
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:38,139
Maybe I like him
because I hope he is.

738
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:40,346
Because I am, too.

739
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:42,979
Maybe all I deserve
is fucked up.

740
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:45,366
You know, when you think
that way, it's all you'll ever get.

741
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,824
Why do you care so much?

742
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,854
What? I don't.

743
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:51,348
But what happens to
you, happens to me.

744
00:38:51,396 --> 00:38:53,922
And I don't want
him happening to me.

745
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,332
I know I deserve better.

746
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:02,001
Wild guess.

747
00:39:02,574 --> 00:39:05,510
Your mother and your father
both loved you unconditionally.

748
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:09,146
How did you know?
How could I not?

749
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:16,715
ALICE: What did
you do with Fogg 17?

750
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:18,748
Can't arrest him,
can't let him go,

751
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:20,103
so we put him in the Clean Room.

752
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:21,719
He can't cast in there,

753
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:25,024
so at least this way, if there's something
else that goes wrong at Brakebills

754
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:27,030
there's a Fogg I
can talk to about it.

755
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:28,963
There's one thing
I'm certain of.

756
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,026
Things are absolutely going
to keep going wrong here.

757
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:35,272
I have a theory why
magic isn't working right.

758
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,399
I've been studying
the control panel

759
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:41,036
and there's a readout on prevailing
Circumstances outside the tank.

760
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:43,546
And, well, the moon
was all over the place.

761
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:45,795
I don't understand. I thought...

762
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:48,018
I mean, when we fixed the moon,

763
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:49,446
it was like we
never even broke it.

764
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:51,820
I think the Lunatics were right,

765
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,553
and the moon's got feelings.
And apparently she's pissed at us.

766
00:39:55,827 --> 00:39:57,853
Great. How do we fix that?

767
00:39:57,929 --> 00:39:58,929
(CHUCKLES)

768
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,392
I have no idea,

769
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:04,595
so I'm just gonna keep studying
the control panel at the greenhouse

770
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:07,729
and see what solution
I can come up with.

771
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,240
Thank you.

772
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:13,607
Oh. Speaking of, I hear your
botanist friend is doing better.

773
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:16,638
Not my friend. Just
somebody I helped out.

774
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:20,275
Okay. Well, the hiring
committee gave him an offer,

775
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:22,581
so you might run into
him in Botany Bay.

776
00:40:23,655 --> 00:40:24,655
Hmm.

777
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:27,120
Fucking great.

779
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:34,065

Yeah.

781
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:37,935
Still going to Fillory?

782

Somebody's gotta
stop the apocalypse.

783
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:42,573
And it's gotta be you.

784
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:44,567
Penny.

785
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:46,233
Just...

786
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:53,113
In my time line, I let you go
on a quest to Fillory without me

787
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:54,378
and you never came back.

788
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:57,480
I'm not that Julia.

789
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:01,425
I know. I'm not... I didn't just
come here and swap Julias. That's...

790
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:05,260
You're totally different.
Christ, you have no idea.

791
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,770
The only thing you for
sure have in common

792
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:10,631
is I could not stop her when she
set her mind to something either.

793
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:16,769
I have to do this, Penny.

794
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:19,638
I know.

795
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:23,539
I just can't go
through that again.

796
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:29,453

00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:32,622
