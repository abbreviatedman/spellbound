00:00:06,959 --> 00:00:09,535
Previously on "The Magicians"...

3
00:00:09,537 --> 00:00:11,088
Charlton?

4
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:13,687
I was a passenger in your unconscious.

5
00:00:13,689 --> 00:00:16,470
- Now I'm still in your head...
- _

6
00:00:16,472 --> 00:00:18,487
But the conscious part.

7
00:00:18,489 --> 00:00:21,265
Whoa, I... I'm... I'm no professor.

8
00:00:21,267 --> 00:00:24,020
Penny, you're the only
Brakebills-educated traveler

9
00:00:24,022 --> 00:00:25,466
currently alive on this planet,

10
00:00:25,468 --> 00:00:27,705
which makes you far more
qualified to teach them

11
00:00:27,707 --> 00:00:29,073
than anyone else I have.

12
00:00:29,075 --> 00:00:30,441
It's Fogg.

13
00:00:30,443 --> 00:00:31,742
He's stuck in the Etheric Realm,

14
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:34,801
and it's my fault.

15
00:00:34,803 --> 00:00:35,879
Hello.

16
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:38,816
I am Bick of the
esteemed House Pickwick.

17
00:00:40,986 --> 00:00:43,854
I've been on the inside,
and I'm telling you

18
00:00:43,856 --> 00:00:45,522
it's a goddamn goose-stepping,

19
00:00:45,524 --> 00:00:48,859
fairy-snatching, ethnic
cleansing Gestapo.

20
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,867
Jesus.

21
00:00:56,869 --> 00:01:00,804
So this pig dude told me
I'm supposed to do a quest?

22
00:01:00,806 --> 00:01:03,941
Yeah, it's fine, Todd. We fixed it.

23
00:01:03,943 --> 00:01:06,076
The Harmonic Convergence
isn't happening anymore.

24
00:01:06,078 --> 00:01:08,979
Uh, no. He was talking about Fillory.

25
00:01:08,981 --> 00:01:11,048
The end of Fillory?

26
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:13,818
So we saved the wrong world?

27
00:01:20,493 --> 00:01:23,193
♪ Something, something, Fillory ♪

28
00:01:23,195 --> 00:01:26,530
♪ A most amazing land ♪

29
00:01:26,532 --> 00:01:31,969
♪ Butt-fucked by catastrophe,
and way before we planned ♪

30
00:01:31,971 --> 00:01:34,671
♪ La, la, blah, blah, Fillory ♪

31
00:01:34,673 --> 00:01:37,341
♪ A land without a god ♪

32
00:01:37,343 --> 00:01:40,344
♪ Needs a brand-new hero,
a strapping lad named... ♪

33
00:01:40,346 --> 00:01:42,880
- Todd, please stop.
- Okay.

34
00:01:42,882 --> 00:01:45,549
Okay. Just wanna get this straight.

35
00:01:45,551 --> 00:01:48,719
So Pig Man gave you the
quest in the form of a song?

36
00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:49,753
Yeah.

37
00:01:49,755 --> 00:01:51,455
I might have changed some of the lines,

38
00:01:51,457 --> 00:01:52,923
but that's the gist.

39
00:01:52,925 --> 00:01:54,892
There's also, like, three more verses,

40
00:01:54,894 --> 00:01:56,627
and the key change is tricky.

41
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,885
- Or you could just write it down.
- Oh, I did.

42
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:01,565
The parts I could remember, anyway,

43
00:02:01,567 --> 00:02:02,596
on a couple of napkins

44
00:02:02,598 --> 00:02:04,087
and then on the back of my hand,

45
00:02:04,089 --> 00:02:06,870
but don't worry. I transferred
that to another napkin.

46
00:02:06,872 --> 00:02:08,972
- But short version...
- Thank you.

47
00:02:08,974 --> 00:02:11,508
Fillory is in real trouble.

48
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,506
He said death is coming

49
00:02:14,508 --> 00:02:16,441
for everyone.

50
00:02:16,443 --> 00:02:20,012
And then he rhymed
that with "smeveryone".

51
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:23,048
Anyway, could you please help me?

52
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,984
I'm not going to help you.

53
00:02:25,986 --> 00:02:28,220
I'm going to take over entirely for you.

54
00:02:28,222 --> 00:02:29,721
Oh, thank God,

55
00:02:29,723 --> 00:02:32,786
because I am dangerously
underqualified for this.

56
00:02:32,788 --> 00:02:33,792
I know.

57
00:02:33,794 --> 00:02:35,026
My notes are at Brakebills.

58
00:02:35,028 --> 00:02:36,495
I probably should've brought 'em.

59
00:02:36,497 --> 00:02:38,664
Okay, so I'll meet you there.

60
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,667
- Kay, bye.
- Okay.

61
00:02:43,404 --> 00:02:45,418
Yeah, no shit, Fillory's in trouble.

62
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,872
Goes by the name of the Dark King.

63
00:02:46,874 --> 00:02:49,374
Or whoever's ordering
dark shit on his behalf.

64
00:02:49,376 --> 00:02:50,442
We're still investigating.

65
00:02:50,444 --> 00:02:51,877
Which we were kind of in the middle of

66
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,378
till you dragged us here
'cause you were sure

67
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,997
Bacon McSwine-Flu was talking about

68
00:02:54,999 --> 00:02:56,615
the Harmonic Convergence.

69
00:02:56,617 --> 00:02:59,785
Oops, we accidentally stopped
billions of people from dying.

70
00:02:59,787 --> 00:03:01,520
- I'm sorry.
- Hmm.

71
00:03:01,522 --> 00:03:02,688
Look, I guessed wrong,

72
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,756
which is why you guys should wait

73
00:03:04,758 --> 00:03:07,392
until I finish reading Todd's
notes before you rush off.

74
00:03:07,394 --> 00:03:09,394
Mm, I don't need Todd

75
00:03:09,396 --> 00:03:12,497
to tell me which twat's
messing up my kingdom.

76
00:03:12,499 --> 00:03:14,566
But if he gives you a clue
how to stop the Dark King,

77
00:03:14,568 --> 00:03:15,600
you know where to find us.

78
00:03:15,602 --> 00:03:17,569
Oh, and tell Josh to meet me

79
00:03:17,571 --> 00:03:19,871
once he's done with his
nephew's bar mitzvah.

80
00:03:19,873 --> 00:03:21,707
Dude drops everything for family.

81
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:22,909
It's weird.

82
00:03:34,054 --> 00:03:35,822
Oh, shit.

83
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:39,024
Uh, sorry I missed the meeting.

84
00:03:39,026 --> 00:03:41,093
- I can't travel, and...
- None of us can.

85
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,994
We all made it here on time,

86
00:03:42,996 --> 00:03:45,597
'cause "emergency faculty meeting".

87
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,996
Yeah, what's going on?
What did Lipson say?

88
00:03:46,998 --> 00:03:48,100
Well, she's in a coma,

89
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,835
- so not much.
- What?

90
00:03:49,837 --> 00:03:51,636
I don't know if you
tried casting yet today,

91
00:03:51,638 --> 00:03:53,071
but FYI: don't.

92
00:03:53,073 --> 00:03:54,606
Circumstances are jacked.

93
00:03:54,608 --> 00:03:57,111
- Some asshole moved the moon.
- Oh, shit.

94
00:03:57,113 --> 00:03:59,811
Acting Dean Lipson was
resetting the campus wards,

95
00:03:59,813 --> 00:04:02,269
didn't realize the
Circumstances had changed.

96
00:04:02,271 --> 00:04:04,595
Fogg's security system
was sicced on her instead.

97
00:04:04,597 --> 00:04:06,551
- Is she gonna be okay?
- From what I hear,

98
00:04:06,553 --> 00:04:08,019
she didn't lose anything vital.

99
00:04:08,021 --> 00:04:09,588
Most of it'll grow back,

100
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,146
but we can't even heal her be...

101
00:04:11,148 --> 00:04:12,691
Because some asshole moved the moon.

102
00:04:12,693 --> 00:04:13,892
- Yeah, I got it.
- Yeah.

103
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,013
Can you shut the security system down

104
00:04:19,015 --> 00:04:20,347
before anyone else gets hurt?

105
00:04:20,349 --> 00:04:23,335
The Dean of Brakebills
can with this, in theory.

106
00:04:23,337 --> 00:04:26,638
Although, that's what Lipson
was doing when she got...

107
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,706
Okay, so what?

108
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,574
Are you in charge then?

109
00:04:29,576 --> 00:04:31,447
- You missed the boat.
- Oh, it's cool.

110
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:32,711
I honestly couldn't give less of a shit.

111
00:04:32,713 --> 00:04:34,750
No, Penny. It's a horrible job.

112
00:04:34,752 --> 00:04:35,786
Nobody wants it.

113
00:04:35,788 --> 00:04:39,184
We all voted for you.

114
00:04:39,186 --> 00:04:42,521
You assholes.

115
00:04:42,523 --> 00:04:44,456
The hell am I even
supposed to do with this?

116
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:45,791
Well, if I knew that,

117
00:04:45,793 --> 00:04:47,459
I wouldn't be giving it to you.

118
00:04:47,461 --> 00:04:49,762
Good luck.

119
00:05:08,048 --> 00:05:09,748
Where the hell could Fen have gone?

120
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,082
I know, right?

121
00:05:11,084 --> 00:05:12,884
I gave her one... two...

122
00:05:12,886 --> 00:05:15,821
well, several jobs, but the headline was

123
00:05:15,823 --> 00:05:17,272
"stay put and find the creep

124
00:05:17,274 --> 00:05:18,795
with the hard-on for hunting fairies".

125
00:05:25,365 --> 00:05:27,132
- Okay, was he afraid of you?
- Yup.

126
00:05:27,134 --> 00:05:28,934
They all think it's my
"time of the month".

127
00:05:28,936 --> 00:05:31,002
- Woman or wolf?
- Who cares?

128
00:05:31,004 --> 00:05:33,280
Either way, I got 'em scared
they'll end up bleeding, too,

129
00:05:33,282 --> 00:05:35,106
so I'm off the hook for a few weeks.

130
00:05:35,108 --> 00:05:36,775
Perk of marching with a bunch of scrotes

131
00:05:36,777 --> 00:05:38,610
who have no clue how lady parts work.

132
00:05:38,612 --> 00:05:39,778
Mm.

133
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,951
Yes, your most excellent Pouchful-ness.

134
00:05:45,953 --> 00:05:47,586
It'll be done straight away.

135
00:05:47,588 --> 00:05:50,422
I also brewed clover tea, your favorite.

136
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,959
Odious veldt marmot.

137
00:05:53,961 --> 00:05:55,694
Problems with the new boss, Rafe?

138
00:05:55,696 --> 00:05:58,130
I hear she's a handful, between us.

139
00:05:59,299 --> 00:06:00,666
Between us?

140
00:06:02,269 --> 00:06:05,136
Her High Leapus Gertrude is a nightmare.

141
00:06:05,138 --> 00:06:06,738
Who's got the King's ear.

142
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,973
Sadly, yes.

143
00:06:07,975 --> 00:06:09,641
I took the job with her to try and make

144
00:06:09,643 --> 00:06:12,110
the King's Council more animal-friendly,

145
00:06:12,112 --> 00:06:14,679
but that creature is
a traitor to her own.

146
00:06:14,681 --> 00:06:16,915
Never trust an animal with a pouch.

147
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:20,619
She's nothing but a puppet
to the king's chief advisor.

148
00:06:20,621 --> 00:06:22,888
- Which is who again?
- Bick Pickwick.

149
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,956
The sexist douche who
ran the tournament?

150
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,825
He offered Her Long-footed-ness

151
00:06:26,827 --> 00:06:29,561
a handsome deal to permanently relocate

152
00:06:29,563 --> 00:06:32,163
all talking animals beyond the walls.

153
00:06:32,165 --> 00:06:35,467
Bick has a deep hatred
for anything non-human.

154
00:06:35,469 --> 00:06:37,936
- Non-human meaning fairies.
- Mm-hmm.

155
00:06:37,938 --> 00:06:39,838
Bick's position could also explain

156
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,307
why there might be species
cleansing without Seb knowing.

157
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:43,708
What are you, dickmatized?

158
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:44,987
No way Seb doesn't know.

159
00:06:44,989 --> 00:06:46,761
There was plenty happening
I didn't know about

160
00:06:46,763 --> 00:06:49,014
- when I was High King.
- Which was fine, because you had me.

161
00:06:49,016 --> 00:06:50,649
And Her Slowness, Abigail.

162
00:06:50,651 --> 00:06:51,883
Oh.

163
00:06:51,885 --> 00:06:53,335
Look, we'll argue, and I'll win later.

164
00:06:53,337 --> 00:06:55,186
Right now we gotta find Fen
and see if she did her job

165
00:06:55,188 --> 00:06:57,689
and got any new intel on the fairies.

166
00:06:57,691 --> 00:06:59,691
Oh, I was supposed to tell you.

167
00:06:59,693 --> 00:07:02,794
Um, before she left, Fen said,

168
00:07:02,796 --> 00:07:07,132
"The Maid on the Outside
will soon be on the Inside".

169
00:07:07,134 --> 00:07:09,634
And by "inside", she meant...

170
00:07:09,636 --> 00:07:10,835
I'm not sure.

171
00:07:10,837 --> 00:07:13,705
At times, she is what the
animals call "human crazy".

172
00:07:13,707 --> 00:07:14,773
Anything else?

173
00:07:14,775 --> 00:07:15,974
Just that she was venturing

174
00:07:15,976 --> 00:07:17,709
into the Windward Woods.

175
00:07:17,711 --> 00:07:20,679
I'm gonna bank she's doing
her actual job fairy-wise

176
00:07:20,681 --> 00:07:22,080
and not just bird-watching.

177
00:07:22,082 --> 00:07:23,715
- Let's find her.
- You go ahead.

178
00:07:23,717 --> 00:07:25,918
I'll go pursue a
different line of inquiry.

179
00:07:34,161 --> 00:07:35,161
Yeah?

180
00:07:36,096 --> 00:07:37,996
Professor... I mean...

181
00:07:37,998 --> 00:07:39,631
Dean Adiyodi?

182
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:41,233
Yeah, come in.

183
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,737
I have a problem.

184
00:07:45,739 --> 00:07:47,873
A very big problem.

185
00:07:49,309 --> 00:07:51,876
Someone stole my pencil case.

186
00:07:51,878 --> 00:07:54,302
Full of... drugs?

187
00:07:54,304 --> 00:07:56,848
Pencils. Special pencils.

188
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,590
And you thought,

189
00:07:58,592 --> 00:08:01,052
"Hey, this is a problem I
should bring to the Dean..."

190
00:08:01,054 --> 00:08:02,754
I think there's a conspiracy afoot,

191
00:08:02,756 --> 00:08:04,422
a league of mischief makers

192
00:08:04,424 --> 00:08:06,091
with a taste for high-end graphite.

193
00:08:09,429 --> 00:08:11,696
So we tried to cast a cleansing spell,

194
00:08:11,698 --> 00:08:14,699
and instead, it just...
it made live chickens.

195
00:08:14,701 --> 00:08:18,003
So many chickens.

196
00:08:18,005 --> 00:08:21,573
So apparently the fertility
and contraception charms

197
00:08:21,575 --> 00:08:24,909
got switched, so, um,

198
00:08:24,911 --> 00:08:27,146
we have a bit of a situation.

199
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,622
They're special because of
their smear resistance and...

200
00:08:32,953 --> 00:08:34,753
I don't think you're
taking me very seriously.

201
00:08:34,755 --> 00:08:36,354
I promise you I am not.

202
00:08:36,356 --> 00:08:38,189
All the air in there
just turned to water.

203
00:08:38,191 --> 00:08:41,226
I shouldn't have to be able
to swim to take astronomy.

204
00:08:41,228 --> 00:08:43,229
Go away.

205
00:08:45,298 --> 00:08:47,832
You really did it this time, huh?

206
00:08:47,834 --> 00:08:49,234
Zelda warned us it would happen.

207
00:08:49,236 --> 00:08:51,603
We changed the Circumstances
of the moon for good.

208
00:08:51,605 --> 00:08:54,072
Yeah.

209
00:08:54,074 --> 00:08:55,373
What do we do?

210
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:58,410
We try to live with what we did.

211
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,011
Back to basics.

212
00:09:00,013 --> 00:09:02,414
Figure out how to cast again. Magic 101.

213
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,782
That's why I'm here,

214
00:09:03,784 --> 00:09:05,617
but we have to figure it out fast.

215
00:09:05,619 --> 00:09:07,152
We stopped the Harmonic Convergence,

216
00:09:07,154 --> 00:09:08,887
but there's still too much magic.

217
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:10,789
Right, and...

218
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,390
If a surge happens,

219
00:09:12,392 --> 00:09:17,829
every spell already jacked is
gonna get me amped up to 11.

220
00:09:17,831 --> 00:09:19,230
Christ!

221
00:09:19,232 --> 00:09:22,368
It's too bad Fogg was
sober when he left.

222
00:09:27,307 --> 00:09:30,442
- What is it?
- I don't know.

223
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,976
But I'd say this is an emergency.

224
00:09:31,978 --> 00:09:34,512
Wouldn't you?

225
00:09:34,514 --> 00:09:36,448
"For Emergencies Only".

226
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,349
That's not ominous at all.

227
00:09:38,351 --> 00:09:40,852
Based on the locator spells on it,

228
00:09:40,854 --> 00:09:42,921
we thought maybe it was built to...

229
00:09:42,923 --> 00:09:44,355
To summon Fogg.

230
00:09:44,357 --> 00:09:46,257
Think it could reach the Etheric Realm?

231
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:48,186
I mean, Kady said he can't leave,

232
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:50,028
but maybe we could get a message out.

233
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,097
Even if we could get it to reach Fogg,

234
00:09:52,099 --> 00:09:53,961
using any magic right
now could backfire,

235
00:09:53,963 --> 00:09:55,100
like it did to Lipson.

236
00:09:55,102 --> 00:09:57,357
Look, students are in actual danger,

237
00:09:57,359 --> 00:09:59,370
this campus is going haywire,

238
00:09:59,372 --> 00:10:01,372
no one knows when the next surge'll hit,

239
00:10:01,374 --> 00:10:03,842
and I have no idea how to help.

240
00:10:03,844 --> 00:10:05,310
I hate to admit it, but I think Fogg

241
00:10:05,312 --> 00:10:07,439
was doing way more work
than we give him credit for.

242
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:08,530
We need him back,

243
00:10:08,532 --> 00:10:10,982
and if this thing can
at least contact him...

244
00:10:10,984 --> 00:10:13,551
Sounds like it's worth the risk.

245
00:10:13,553 --> 00:10:15,286
Okay.

246
00:10:15,288 --> 00:10:16,855
Whew.

247
00:10:16,857 --> 00:10:19,424
This shit messes me up.

248
00:10:19,426 --> 00:10:21,059
What the hell, Julia?

249
00:10:21,061 --> 00:10:23,295
I'm fine. Did it work?

250
00:10:25,565 --> 00:10:27,899
It's probably broken like
everything else in this school.

251
00:10:34,207 --> 00:10:35,741
Duty calls.

252
00:10:41,414 --> 00:10:43,248
Jesus. Hi.

253
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,849
Where have you been?

254
00:10:44,851 --> 00:10:46,451
Well, I have to sleep sometimes,

255
00:10:46,453 --> 00:10:48,253
and everything you do
isn't that interesting.

256
00:10:48,255 --> 00:10:49,587
I'm thinking whatever I miss,

257
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:51,890
I'll just find in your brain later.

258
00:10:51,892 --> 00:10:54,459
What do you people call
it? Uh, binge watching.

259
00:10:54,461 --> 00:10:56,161
I fear outright rebellion.

260
00:10:56,163 --> 00:10:58,013
The best and swiftest way to get it...

261
00:10:58,015 --> 00:10:59,697
To get what? Your Majesty.

262
00:10:59,699 --> 00:11:00,999
Gold.

263
00:11:01,001 --> 00:11:02,934
Our reserves are depleted.

264
00:11:02,936 --> 00:11:04,536
The salaries of our soldiers

265
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,905
and barrier builders
haven't been paid in weeks,

266
00:11:06,907 --> 00:11:08,740
and both are threatening to strike.

267
00:11:08,742 --> 00:11:12,610
The slightest work stoppage
could imperil all of us.

268
00:11:12,612 --> 00:11:14,979
As reports indicate,

269
00:11:14,981 --> 00:11:17,448
the Takers are gathering in force.

270
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:20,659
Which is why I must lead
a cohort of Centurions

271
00:11:20,661 --> 00:11:23,339
into the Windward
Woods and find the gold

272
00:11:23,341 --> 00:11:26,090
the fairies steal and hoard.

273
00:11:26,092 --> 00:11:29,060
Okay, but that really doesn't track.

274
00:11:29,062 --> 00:11:32,897
Fairies are into
mushrooms and milk baths.

275
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:34,899
You have experience with them?

276
00:11:34,901 --> 00:11:36,367
I do, sire.

277
00:11:36,369 --> 00:11:38,303
Mostly bad, right?
According to your memories.

278
00:11:38,305 --> 00:11:40,205
Then you know that
they're as untrustworthy

279
00:11:40,207 --> 00:11:42,207
as they are greedy.

280
00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:45,143
They have purloined our
citizens' gold for years.

281
00:11:45,145 --> 00:11:47,078
My men and I will get it back.

282
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,480
If I may, Your Majesty.

283
00:11:49,482 --> 00:11:51,182
I do have experience with fairies,

284
00:11:51,184 --> 00:11:53,885
and while they are crafty negotiators,

285
00:11:53,887 --> 00:11:56,120
they're not thieves.

286
00:11:56,122 --> 00:11:59,157
If they have our citizens' gold,

287
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:01,159
perhaps it's from a misunderstanding

288
00:12:01,161 --> 00:12:03,328
that can be worked out diplomatically.

289
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,997
Payments are due no later
than tomorrow's sunset.

290
00:12:05,999 --> 00:12:07,565
I'm quite aware.

291
00:12:07,567 --> 00:12:09,167
And diplomacy...

292
00:12:09,169 --> 00:12:11,803
Can always be followed by force,

293
00:12:11,805 --> 00:12:14,106
but the reverse is rarely true.

294
00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:17,642
Okay.

295
00:12:17,644 --> 00:12:20,478
I get the charisma. His intelligence.

296
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,513
- He's royal but down to Earth.
- Yeah, it's true.

297
00:12:22,515 --> 00:12:24,115
- It works.
- Mm-hmm.

298
00:12:24,117 --> 00:12:26,217
But trust him?

299
00:12:26,219 --> 00:12:28,152
Truly?

300
00:12:28,154 --> 00:12:30,255
We need five pounds of gold by tomorrow

301
00:12:30,257 --> 00:12:32,423
and another 15 by the week's end,

302
00:12:32,425 --> 00:12:35,361
or the life of every
Fillorian is in peril.

303
00:12:38,231 --> 00:12:40,031
Accompany Pickwick.

304
00:12:40,033 --> 00:12:41,799
If you find the fairies' encampment,

305
00:12:41,801 --> 00:12:44,202
you have one hour to negotiate.

306
00:12:44,204 --> 00:12:46,304
If that fails,

307
00:12:46,306 --> 00:12:48,714
you'll stand down and let the Centurions

308
00:12:48,716 --> 00:12:50,575
do whatever is necessary.

309
00:12:50,577 --> 00:12:53,077
I trust your wisdom, sire.

310
00:13:01,688 --> 00:13:04,222
Whoa! Hey, easy.

311
00:13:04,224 --> 00:13:05,590
I'm High King Margo.

312
00:13:05,592 --> 00:13:07,362
We were all pals back in the day.

313
00:13:07,364 --> 00:13:09,299
Oh, we know who you are.

314
00:13:10,463 --> 00:13:12,397
Look, my friend was
supposed to find you.

315
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,400
- I think we can help each other.
- Margo?

316
00:13:16,569 --> 00:13:18,904
It's okay, Rowan. She's with me.

317
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:29,135
Ugh.

318
00:13:29,137 --> 00:13:31,504
If that's from the selkie
in the east fountain,

319
00:13:31,506 --> 00:13:33,606
you might want to get
tested for the clap.

320
00:13:33,608 --> 00:13:36,309
Holy shit, am I glad to see you.

321
00:13:36,311 --> 00:13:37,957
How'd you get out of the Etheric Realm?

322
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:39,345
Long story.

323
00:13:39,347 --> 00:13:41,514
Point is, I heard your call.

324
00:13:41,516 --> 00:13:43,516
I'm here, and yes,

325
00:13:43,518 --> 00:13:45,552
I could use a goddamn drink.

326
00:13:46,955 --> 00:13:50,089
- Weren't you sober?
- Ah, yes.

327
00:13:50,091 --> 00:13:51,958
Right, well,

328
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,293
the Etheric Realm was a lot.

329
00:13:56,597 --> 00:13:58,464
Let's find a bottle,

330
00:13:58,466 --> 00:14:00,534
and you can fill me in.

331
00:14:01,636 --> 00:14:03,102
Okay.

332
00:14:08,009 --> 00:14:11,077
The traveler professor who cannot travel

333
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:14,347
is now the Acting Dean.

334
00:14:14,349 --> 00:14:16,148
Students are blowing themselves up,

335
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:18,484
and I presume

336
00:14:18,486 --> 00:14:22,488
you are the aforementioned
"assholes who moved the moon".

337
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,124
Yes, but I found a workaround.

338
00:14:25,126 --> 00:14:28,580
If you cast as if your
altitude is 1,000 feet lower

339
00:14:28,582 --> 00:14:31,197
and the Pleiades are six
degrees further to the north,

340
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,033
well, then...

341
00:14:35,136 --> 00:14:37,069
Ah.

342
00:14:37,071 --> 00:14:38,958
If we apply this tweak to every spell,

343
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,941
we can teach people to
cast without exploding

344
00:14:41,943 --> 00:14:44,577
or turning things into chickens.

345
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:46,545
What happened to your hand?

346
00:14:46,547 --> 00:14:49,148
I thought the Etheric Realm
was supposed to be a fun trip.

347
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,083
Yes.

348
00:14:51,085 --> 00:14:52,952
Leaving it, less so,

349
00:14:52,954 --> 00:14:55,121
but I had no choice.

350
00:14:55,123 --> 00:14:56,904
I couldn't risk anyone else getting hurt

351
00:14:56,906 --> 00:14:58,807
by the security system I built.

352
00:15:00,395 --> 00:15:02,461
Yes, I can deactivate it,

353
00:15:02,463 --> 00:15:05,165
and I will need the master key, please.

354
00:15:07,235 --> 00:15:09,101
- Thank you.
- Whoa, hold up, hold up.

355
00:15:09,103 --> 00:15:11,879
I still got student problems
to put on your radar.

356
00:15:11,881 --> 00:15:14,573
Penny, I have to go
save hundreds of lives.

357
00:15:14,575 --> 00:15:17,444
I think you can handle
a few whiny students.

358
00:15:18,546 --> 00:15:21,081
See? Delegating!

359
00:15:22,216 --> 00:15:25,051
Look, we got a common enemy here.

360
00:15:25,053 --> 00:15:26,285
The Dark King's goons

361
00:15:26,287 --> 00:15:27,995
are itching to make your life hell.

362
00:15:27,997 --> 00:15:30,523
We've always dealt with hostile humans.

363
00:15:30,525 --> 00:15:32,458
Yeah, well, this one's got an army.

364
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,582
In which you serve.

365
00:15:33,584 --> 00:15:36,053
I'm undercover so I can
get information on him,

366
00:15:36,055 --> 00:15:38,112
which we could be sharing
with each other right now

367
00:15:38,114 --> 00:15:40,255
if you'd just set your
motherfucker to receive.

368
00:15:40,257 --> 00:15:42,424
Okay, let's dial it down, guys.

369
00:15:42,426 --> 00:15:43,825
We're all friends here.

370
00:15:43,827 --> 00:15:45,494
Forgive my bluntness, Fen,

371
00:15:45,496 --> 00:15:47,195
but your choice of friends

372
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:48,730
makes me doubt our choice of ally.

373
00:15:48,732 --> 00:15:50,565
Maybe you're too young
or dumb to remember,

374
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:52,868
but I'm the king who made
peace with your people.

375
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,369
Is that what you think you did?

376
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:55,371
Yeah.

377
00:15:56,707 --> 00:15:57,807
Rowan, wait.

378
00:16:00,177 --> 00:16:01,543
Okay, what does she think I did?

379
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:04,813
Well, very few fairies who
knew you are still alive today,

380
00:16:04,815 --> 00:16:08,283
and the rest just know the
story of High King Margo,

381
00:16:08,285 --> 00:16:09,985
which, over the centuries,

382
00:16:09,987 --> 00:16:13,288
shifted with each retelling.

383
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,691
So I'm being boned by a
giant game of telephone.

384
00:16:15,693 --> 00:16:16,825
No, no, no, no, no.

385
00:16:16,827 --> 00:16:18,527
Phone games are fun...
this, not so much.

386
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:22,531
See, you say you made peace.

387
00:16:22,533 --> 00:16:24,433
They say you destroyed their realm

388
00:16:24,435 --> 00:16:26,335
and allowed fairy hunts for sport.

389
00:16:26,337 --> 00:16:28,370
It's a real "potato, potahto".

390
00:16:28,372 --> 00:16:30,839
No, it's "potato,
po-massive-fucking-lie".

391
00:16:30,841 --> 00:16:33,909
Look, I found them, gained their trust.

392
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:38,647
You think that was easy for me
after what happened to my baby?

393
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:40,382
But I did it.

394
00:16:40,384 --> 00:16:43,819
And then you barrel in and
just completely screw the pooch.

395
00:16:43,821 --> 00:16:46,655
- And not in a good way.
- Okay.

396
00:16:46,657 --> 00:16:48,390
You know what? You're right.

397
00:16:48,392 --> 00:16:51,760
I... uh, yeah.

398
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:53,061
I am.

399
00:16:53,063 --> 00:16:56,631
But now the fairies
need to trust us both.

400
00:16:56,633 --> 00:16:58,768
How can I help make that happen?

401
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:01,504
You won't like it.

402
00:17:08,946 --> 00:17:10,847
Oh, that's not right.

403
00:17:13,417 --> 00:17:16,551
I know what I'm doing,
if you don't mind.

404
00:17:16,553 --> 00:17:17,819
It's a mistake.

405
00:17:17,821 --> 00:17:19,788
For sure.

406
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,057
I'm correcting spells
for the new Circumstances.

407
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:24,793
It's math. I don't
make mistakes at math.

408
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:27,062
No, I mean,

409
00:17:27,064 --> 00:17:29,831
that is a spell for
cooking without a fire,

410
00:17:29,833 --> 00:17:31,933
but for real...

411
00:17:31,935 --> 00:17:33,935
that's gonna be a pretty terrible steak.

412
00:17:33,937 --> 00:17:36,972
You need flame to denature the proteins.

413
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:38,907
What do I know, though?

414
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:40,275
You a teacher here?

415
00:17:40,277 --> 00:17:41,376
We could be colleagues.

416
00:17:41,378 --> 00:17:43,845
I'm interviewing for the botany job.

417
00:17:43,847 --> 00:17:45,515
Hamish Bax.

418
00:17:46,717 --> 00:17:48,950
Alice Quinn.

419
00:17:48,952 --> 00:17:51,086
Not related to Stephanie Quinn,

420
00:17:51,088 --> 00:17:52,288
are you?

421
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:56,625
We met at a rare flower expo.

422
00:17:56,627 --> 00:17:59,995
I found her orchid quite impressive.

423
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:01,797
Oh, God.

424
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:04,032
No. No, nothing like that.

425
00:18:04,034 --> 00:18:06,869
I would never date another botanist.

426
00:18:10,607 --> 00:18:12,874
Wait. Shit.

427
00:18:12,876 --> 00:18:15,578
I don't understand. My fix was working.

428
00:18:16,814 --> 00:18:19,581
According to Todd's napkins, there are,

429
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:25,520
"evil forces coming from
a distant realm to invade".

430
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:27,789
You think this is enough to go on?

431
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:30,025
Well, Fillory was overrun
by these Taker creatures,

432
00:18:30,027 --> 00:18:31,993
so it's gotta be them.

433
00:18:31,995 --> 00:18:34,029
So you're going?

434
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:36,631
- I could use your help.
- I could use yours.

435
00:18:38,502 --> 00:18:41,369
Fogg's back.

436
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:43,872
You didn't even want to be a professor.

437
00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:45,774
We're talking about the
fate of an entire world.

438
00:18:45,776 --> 00:18:47,108
Didn't we just do this, though?

439
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:50,412
One minute, it's the
Harmonic Convergence,

440
00:18:50,414 --> 00:18:52,447
then it's the moon, and now Fillory?

441
00:18:52,449 --> 00:18:55,083
- Can't we just...
- Sit back and relax?

442
00:18:55,085 --> 00:18:56,685
- No, but...
- Come on, Penny.

443
00:18:56,687 --> 00:18:58,019
Look, you know what I'm after.

444
00:18:58,021 --> 00:19:00,722
A life with you,

445
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:02,157
here or wherever, honestly.

446
00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:03,419
Why not Fillory?

447
00:19:03,421 --> 00:19:06,394
Because not every
apocalypse is our problem.

448
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:09,197
We just survived the last one by a hair,

449
00:19:09,199 --> 00:19:10,866
and what is it all for
if we can't kick back

450
00:19:10,868 --> 00:19:12,601
on a beach somewhere and enjoy it?

451
00:19:12,603 --> 00:19:14,569
Let me tell you something.

452
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:18,173
The world doesn't wait
for timing to be right.

453
00:19:18,175 --> 00:19:20,076
I want to know how long I've gotta wait.

454
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:24,679
You live to 35, and
then you get to be done?

455
00:19:24,681 --> 00:19:26,983
Or is this forever?

456
00:19:29,052 --> 00:19:30,785
I get you need magic
to mean something...

457
00:19:30,787 --> 00:19:32,554
Oh, I see what this is.

458
00:19:32,556 --> 00:19:34,155
You think it's some irrational reaction

459
00:19:34,157 --> 00:19:35,724
to my best friend dying, and eventually,

460
00:19:35,726 --> 00:19:37,393
I'll just get over it?

461
00:19:38,562 --> 00:19:40,795
Well, your math was right before.

462
00:19:40,797 --> 00:19:42,731
Okay, but it's definitely not now.

463
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:43,932
I don't know why, but I think

464
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:46,902
the Circumstances just changed again.

465
00:19:46,904 --> 00:19:48,904
Oh, shit. I told Fogg it was safe.

466
00:19:48,906 --> 00:19:51,039
If he tries to use my
fix, and it backfires...

467
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,607
I have to warn him

468
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:55,010
before he tries to disable
the security system.

469
00:20:03,887 --> 00:20:06,088
Julia, I'm not judging you.

470
00:20:06,858 --> 00:20:08,581
You're allowed to
grieve however you want.

471
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:09,591
Thank you for your permission.

472
00:20:09,593 --> 00:20:11,593
Yeah, but the shit
you do affects me too.

473
00:20:11,595 --> 00:20:13,194
I think I can't do what I need to do

474
00:20:13,196 --> 00:20:15,497
if I'm worried about how
it's gonna affect you.

475
00:20:15,499 --> 00:20:17,666
Worried about me? I'm worried about you.

476
00:20:17,668 --> 00:20:19,935
Yeah. That's the problem.

477
00:20:19,937 --> 00:20:21,169
So...

478
00:20:21,171 --> 00:20:23,105
what are you saying?

479
00:20:24,141 --> 00:20:25,675
I think we need to be done.

480
00:20:34,222 --> 00:20:36,545
Emergency protocols are active.

481
00:20:36,547 --> 00:20:37,886
The hell?

482
00:20:37,888 --> 00:20:39,554
For your own safety,
please stay in place

483
00:20:39,556 --> 00:20:42,090
and await instructions.

484
00:20:42,092 --> 00:20:44,593
Emergency protocols are active.

485
00:20:44,595 --> 00:20:45,660
For your own safety,

486
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:49,864
please stay in place
and await instructions.

487
00:20:49,866 --> 00:20:52,534
Emergency protocols are active.

488
00:20:52,536 --> 00:20:53,635
For your own safety,

489
00:20:53,637 --> 00:20:57,706
please stay in place
and await instructions.

490
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:58,873
Emergency protocols...

491
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,875
Looks like you're not
going to Fillory after all.

492
00:21:00,877 --> 00:21:03,245
For your own safety,
please stay in place...

493
00:21:10,961 --> 00:21:13,640
Look, I really thought I
was doing the right thing.

494
00:21:13,642 --> 00:21:15,275
By robbing us of our homeland?

495
00:21:15,277 --> 00:21:16,343
By giving you a place

496
00:21:16,345 --> 00:21:18,812
where you and your weird
mushroom eggs could survive.

497
00:21:18,814 --> 00:21:21,982
You promised sanctuary
and left us vulnerable.

498
00:21:21,984 --> 00:21:24,618
When your people persecuted us

499
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,920
because we had no way
to defend ourselves,

500
00:21:26,922 --> 00:21:29,323
you abandoned us.

501
00:21:29,325 --> 00:21:31,959
And you can understand

502
00:21:31,961 --> 00:21:34,962
how that would make the
fairies feel, can't you, Margo?

503
00:21:34,964 --> 00:21:36,163
Okay, yeah, of course

504
00:21:36,165 --> 00:21:38,265
I'm sorry you went through that,

505
00:21:38,267 --> 00:21:39,700
but it was after my reign ended.

506
00:21:39,702 --> 00:21:41,134
You really think that justifies

507
00:21:41,136 --> 00:21:42,703
the harm you set into motion?

508
00:21:42,705 --> 00:21:44,871
Jesus.

509
00:21:44,873 --> 00:21:46,907
You step out for 300 goddamn years,

510
00:21:46,909 --> 00:21:48,208
and a bunch of gossip girls

511
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:50,077
turn your whole life
into the Nuremberg trials?

512
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:51,134
Margo.

513
00:21:51,136 --> 00:21:54,715
Look, this diplomatic milk
bath is all very kabuki,

514
00:21:54,717 --> 00:21:56,717
but let me tell you
what my dad always said.

515
00:21:56,719 --> 00:21:58,819
"You can't fix stupid".

516
00:21:58,821 --> 00:22:00,687
Skipping past the fact
he always said it to me,

517
00:22:00,689 --> 00:22:03,223
I'll add, I'm not the problem here,

518
00:22:03,225 --> 00:22:06,126
and if you don't work with me
to bring down the Dark King,

519
00:22:06,128 --> 00:22:08,095
you're Olympic-gold-medal stupid.

520
00:22:08,097 --> 00:22:10,797
- Ember's balls, Margo.
- Get out.

521
00:22:13,002 --> 00:22:15,869
Bick coming! Run, hide!

522
00:22:17,706 --> 00:22:20,079
Emergency protocols are active.

523
00:22:20,081 --> 00:22:22,242
Dean. Dean!

524
00:22:22,244 --> 00:22:25,012
And await instructions.

525
00:22:25,014 --> 00:22:28,115
Emergency protocols are active.

526
00:22:28,117 --> 00:22:30,318
- Penny.
- The hell is going on?

527
00:22:32,421 --> 00:22:34,755
I'm afraid Alice's
circumstantial mediation

528
00:22:34,757 --> 00:22:36,089
didn't work.

529
00:22:36,091 --> 00:22:37,791
When I tried to shut
down the security system,

530
00:22:37,793 --> 00:22:40,694
it set off all the
school's defenses at once.

531
00:22:40,696 --> 00:22:43,263
- And you can't shut it down?
- I'm trying.

532
00:22:43,265 --> 00:22:45,732
In the meanwhile, I
strongly suggest you stay put

533
00:22:45,734 --> 00:22:48,902
so you don't get blown
up and sprayed with acid,

534
00:22:48,904 --> 00:22:51,738
eaten by centipedes, or turned into one.

535
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,741
This is a school.

536
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,743
Hey, got most of it,
but we still need to...

537
00:22:56,745 --> 00:22:58,278
Yes, I know what we need. Let's go.

538
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,880
Well, how can we help?

539
00:22:59,882 --> 00:23:01,381
Stay put.

540
00:23:01,383 --> 00:23:03,150
Eliot and I have it covered.

541
00:23:03,152 --> 00:23:05,053
You mean Todd?

542
00:23:05,921 --> 00:23:08,455
Y... yes. Of course.

543
00:23:08,457 --> 00:23:09,956
Isn't that what I said?

544
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:11,825
Oh, wait, Todd.

545
00:23:11,827 --> 00:23:13,663
I just had a quick question,

546
00:23:13,665 --> 00:23:15,295
uh, about something the Pig Man said.

547
00:23:15,297 --> 00:23:16,797
Of course, yeah.

548
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,866
Which professor's Pig Man?

549
00:23:19,868 --> 00:23:23,370
The Pig Man. From Fillory?

550
00:23:23,372 --> 00:23:25,839
- What about him?
- Todd!

551
00:23:25,841 --> 00:23:27,775
Sorry, gotta bounce.

552
00:23:29,878 --> 00:23:33,246
You saw that, right?

553
00:23:33,248 --> 00:23:35,449
He had no clue what I was talking about.

554
00:23:35,451 --> 00:23:38,051
It's Todd. He's always clueless.

555
00:23:38,053 --> 00:23:40,487
No, I'm telling you something's up.

556
00:23:40,489 --> 00:23:44,091
I mean, Fogg's acting off, too, right?

557
00:23:44,093 --> 00:23:46,827
The drinking, the burns on his hands.

558
00:23:46,829 --> 00:23:49,096
I just figured the Etheric
Realm did a number on him.

559
00:23:49,098 --> 00:23:52,899
You saw what Todd was
carrying, too, right?

560
00:23:52,901 --> 00:23:57,204
I mean, Azurite, Bondoc
Prisms, beech ash.

561
00:23:57,206 --> 00:23:59,806
That's all reserved for Major Arcana.

562
00:23:59,808 --> 00:24:04,177
Or they could just be trying
to fix the security spells.

563
00:24:04,179 --> 00:24:05,779
We should follow them.

564
00:24:05,781 --> 00:24:08,724
And get turned into
centipedes or whatever?

565
00:24:08,726 --> 00:24:10,350
No, thanks.

566
00:24:10,352 --> 00:24:11,918
Also, no offense,

567
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,353
rather not be around you right now.

568
00:24:13,355 --> 00:24:15,222
What? Yeah, cool.

569
00:24:15,224 --> 00:24:18,091
Okay, stay here by
yourself. I... I'm gonna go.

570
00:24:18,093 --> 00:24:19,893
And get turned into a centipede.

571
00:24:19,895 --> 00:24:21,028
Fuck.

572
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,553
Well, this is definitely the
most exciting job interview

573
00:24:25,555 --> 00:24:27,901
I've ever been on.

574
00:24:27,903 --> 00:24:30,337
I don't understand why you're
still hoping to reach Fogg.

575
00:24:30,339 --> 00:24:33,440
He clearly tried your casting
tweak, and it backfired.

576
00:24:33,442 --> 00:24:35,287
Why we're trapped here
in the first place?

577
00:24:35,289 --> 00:24:36,777
Well, if he's trying to fix it,

578
00:24:36,779 --> 00:24:39,112
he'll need to understand how
to adjust our current situation.

579
00:24:39,114 --> 00:24:40,369
I'm getting the sense

580
00:24:40,371 --> 00:24:42,516
you're not a fan of
things you can't calculate.

581
00:24:42,518 --> 00:24:44,495
I'm starting to see why
you spend all your time

582
00:24:44,497 --> 00:24:46,354
around plants.

583
00:24:54,463 --> 00:24:56,296
Shit.

584
00:24:56,298 --> 00:24:58,498
How do the Circumstances keep changing?

585
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,434
Look, what do you say
we forget the note,

586
00:25:00,436 --> 00:25:03,303
take down those wards, and
go find the Dean ourselves?

587
00:25:03,305 --> 00:25:05,172
We can't even cast properly.

588
00:25:05,174 --> 00:25:08,875
Undoing a spell doesn't
require the same rigor.

589
00:25:08,877 --> 00:25:12,412
It's like pulling up a
weed with a deep taproot.

590
00:25:12,414 --> 00:25:16,417
Just need to get under it
at the right point, and...

591
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,787
Voilà.

592
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:28,462
Okay.

593
00:25:28,464 --> 00:25:31,531
Okay, maybe I'm just paying
for that botanist's confidence.

594
00:25:31,533 --> 00:25:33,233
I don't think I should
try a healing spell.

595
00:25:33,235 --> 00:25:34,667
I think it might make things worse.

596
00:25:34,669 --> 00:25:35,902
Infirmary?

597
00:25:35,904 --> 00:25:37,370
That's all the way across campus.

598
00:25:37,372 --> 00:25:40,407
Okay, um, can we make
it to the greenhouse?

599
00:25:40,409 --> 00:25:43,411
There might be something
there I can use.

600
00:25:48,417 --> 00:25:51,151
They were just here.

601
00:25:51,153 --> 00:25:52,987
Someone must've warned them.

602
00:25:55,237 --> 00:25:57,105
Search the tents.

603
00:26:26,355 --> 00:26:27,988
Hey.

604
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:30,090
Didn't you hear the
order? Check the tents.

605
00:26:30,092 --> 00:26:32,260
- Now.
- Okay.

606
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,531
Go.

607
00:26:42,871 --> 00:26:45,139
Well, well. Look what I found.

608
00:26:46,575 --> 00:26:48,241
He planted that.

609
00:26:48,243 --> 00:26:50,143
He planted that gold like a bad cop,

610
00:26:50,145 --> 00:26:52,646
like that show you... like
Vic Mackey on "The Shield".

611
00:26:52,648 --> 00:26:56,316
You were lecturing me on
the true nature of fairies?

612
00:26:56,318 --> 00:26:58,451
They've changed,

613
00:26:58,453 --> 00:27:00,154
it would appear.

614
00:27:02,357 --> 00:27:06,927
Janet of House Pluchinsky,
what are you doing here?

615
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:08,562
Been with you guys the whole time.

616
00:27:08,564 --> 00:27:10,063
Jesus.

617
00:27:10,065 --> 00:27:13,133
Women are just invisible
to you, aren't they, sir?

618
00:27:13,135 --> 00:27:15,068
Congratulations, Bick.

619
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:17,437
Now, shouldn't we get
this gold back to our king

620
00:27:17,439 --> 00:27:19,973
as soon as possible?

621
00:27:19,975 --> 00:27:22,676
We'll hunt the fairies down another day

622
00:27:22,678 --> 00:27:25,345
and no doubt find more gold.

623
00:27:25,347 --> 00:27:28,215
Centurions, back to Whitespire.

624
00:27:31,019 --> 00:27:33,554
- Thanks for the heads up.
- You're welcome.

625
00:27:48,203 --> 00:27:49,369
- Careful.
- Oh, Jesus.

626
00:27:49,371 --> 00:27:50,371
Land mines.

627
00:27:54,676 --> 00:27:56,910
Oh. Hey, guys.

628
00:27:56,912 --> 00:28:00,146
Um, aren't you supposed
to be on lockdown?

629
00:28:00,148 --> 00:28:02,415
Wanted to help. What you up to?

630
00:28:02,417 --> 00:28:04,250
Ah, nothing.

631
00:28:04,252 --> 00:28:06,453
Just, like, getting supplies.

632
00:28:06,455 --> 00:28:09,322
That's cinnabar.
That shit's pretty toxic.

633
00:28:09,324 --> 00:28:10,423
- Mm-hmm.
- No.

634
00:28:10,425 --> 00:28:14,007
This is, um, cinna... mon.

635
00:28:14,009 --> 00:28:15,164
Cinnamon?

636
00:28:15,166 --> 00:28:18,732
How's cinnamon gonna help
with the security system?

637
00:28:18,734 --> 00:28:20,753
Dean Fogg asked if I could...

638
00:28:20,755 --> 00:28:22,413
Why you acting so squirrely?

639
00:28:22,415 --> 00:28:24,170
Why are you acting so squirrely?

640
00:28:24,172 --> 00:28:26,473
I always act this way, okay?

641
00:28:26,475 --> 00:28:27,859
You know, whatever.

642
00:28:27,861 --> 00:28:32,078
I have to get this for Fogg...
to Fogg, because of the...

643
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,613
for his toast, I don't know.

644
00:28:33,615 --> 00:28:35,916
Wait, careful! There are land mines.

645
00:28:36,922 --> 00:28:38,189
Thank you.

646
00:28:40,255 --> 00:28:42,422
Holy shit!

647
00:28:46,461 --> 00:28:48,328
Oh, my God.

648
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,665
Did I just die?

649
00:28:59,909 --> 00:29:01,242
Here.

650
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,548
You see anything we
can use for an antidote?

651
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,783
Is there a section for healing herbs?

652
00:29:09,785 --> 00:29:11,498
Uh...

653
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:14,123
Look for variants of
plantago lanceolata.

654
00:29:14,125 --> 00:29:15,125
Okay.

655
00:29:17,128 --> 00:29:18,561
Hey, I found it.

656
00:29:18,563 --> 00:29:21,397
Okay, you need to make a
poultice from the leaves.

657
00:29:28,506 --> 00:29:30,373
That blossom...

658
00:29:30,375 --> 00:29:32,308
it's from a different world.

659
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,010
It shouldn't even be able to grow here.

660
00:29:34,012 --> 00:29:35,177
Why not?

661
00:29:35,179 --> 00:29:37,380
Different Circumstances.

662
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:42,084
Everyone thought she'd
died before she cracked it.

663
00:29:42,086 --> 00:29:43,786
What are you talking about?

664
00:29:43,788 --> 00:29:46,766
Ahh.

665
00:29:46,768 --> 00:29:49,191
Your late Exo-Botony
professor was working on

666
00:29:49,193 --> 00:29:52,695
a sort of terrarium for magical plants.

667
00:29:52,697 --> 00:29:54,330
They don't need just water or light.

668
00:29:54,332 --> 00:29:57,234
They require specific
Circumstances to survive.

669
00:30:00,071 --> 00:30:02,204
That's to make the Circumstances match

670
00:30:02,206 --> 00:30:04,174
to any growing conditions.

671
00:30:05,076 --> 00:30:07,276
Moon, body of water, altitude.

672
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:08,644
Holy shit. I think you're right.

673
00:30:08,646 --> 00:30:10,246
Mm.

674
00:30:10,248 --> 00:30:11,781
Wait, wait, wait!
You might kill the flower.

675
00:30:11,783 --> 00:30:14,084
Yeah, or find the fix for magic.

676
00:30:38,209 --> 00:30:39,408
Wow. That actually worked.

677
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,577
Just shut up for a second.

678
00:30:41,579 --> 00:30:43,113
What is it?

679
00:30:44,148 --> 00:30:47,183
If Fogg gets my note,

680
00:30:47,185 --> 00:30:50,152
I might actually be
able to fix this mess.

681
00:30:50,154 --> 00:30:54,356
So other Todd tied you up
and locked you in a closet?

682
00:30:54,358 --> 00:30:57,059
Yeah, but I've never
been great with knots,

683
00:30:57,061 --> 00:30:59,795
so it was pretty easy for me to escape.

684
00:30:59,797 --> 00:31:03,699
Only question is, why would evil twin me

685
00:31:03,701 --> 00:31:06,435
wanna get rid of me in the first place?

686
00:31:06,437 --> 00:31:08,804
Of course.

687
00:31:08,806 --> 00:31:10,339
"Evil".

688
00:31:10,341 --> 00:31:11,807
He wasn't your twin.

689
00:31:11,809 --> 00:31:13,342
I think he's from another timeline.

690
00:31:13,344 --> 00:31:15,611
- Wait, for realsies?
- No, it... it adds up.

691
00:31:15,613 --> 00:31:17,613
You know, the two Todds plus cinnabar,

692
00:31:17,615 --> 00:31:20,382
which last time I saw, was
being used for time magic.

693
00:31:20,384 --> 00:31:22,852
I always wanted to meet
someone from another timeline.

694
00:31:22,854 --> 00:31:24,086
Wait a minute, guys.

695
00:31:24,088 --> 00:31:27,857
What if Dean Fogg isn't our Fogg?

696
00:31:27,859 --> 00:31:29,917
Describe him. I transcribed his memoir.

697
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,227
I know all 40 Foggs.

698
00:31:31,229 --> 00:31:32,722
Even got nicknames for some of them.

699
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,230
Fedora Fogg,

700
00:31:34,232 --> 00:31:36,298
Cocaine Fogg, Swinger Fogg...

701
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,500
actually, those last
two are the same Fogg.

702
00:31:38,502 --> 00:31:40,703
Uh, well, this one's a heavy drinker.

703
00:31:40,705 --> 00:31:42,204
No, that doesn't really narrow it down.

704
00:31:42,206 --> 00:31:43,305
Okay. He has burns on his hands.

705
00:31:43,307 --> 00:31:45,174
He calls you... other you "Eliot".

706
00:31:45,176 --> 00:31:47,109
- He has...
- Ohh.

707
00:31:47,111 --> 00:31:48,478
Poop.

708
00:31:49,413 --> 00:31:50,413
What?

709
00:31:51,582 --> 00:31:53,782
I call that one Psycho Fogg.

710
00:31:53,784 --> 00:31:57,453
See, in timeline 17,
Brakebills kinda blew up.

711
00:31:57,455 --> 00:31:59,221
Killed almost everybody.

712
00:31:59,223 --> 00:32:01,290
And those burns on Fogg's hands...

713
00:32:01,292 --> 00:32:03,492
They're kinda 'cause
he's the one who did it.

714
00:32:03,494 --> 00:32:05,027
Well, what would he be doing here?

715
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:06,328
Psycho Fogg?

716
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:08,264
Let's not wait to find out, okay?

717
00:32:08,266 --> 00:32:10,200
- Let's go.
- Ah, okay.

718
00:32:14,871 --> 00:32:17,090
Just over six pounds.

719
00:32:17,092 --> 00:32:19,337
Enough to mollify the
soldiers and workers

720
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:20,842
for tonight, at least.

721
00:32:20,844 --> 00:32:22,831
You're confident you can retrieve more?

722
00:32:22,833 --> 00:32:25,300
No, sire.

723
00:32:25,302 --> 00:32:27,936
Certain.

724
00:32:27,938 --> 00:32:30,505
Ugh.

725
00:32:30,507 --> 00:32:32,307
Mm.

726
00:32:32,309 --> 00:32:35,678
Smells like... shit.

727
00:32:37,281 --> 00:32:38,880
I don't control where the fairies hide

728
00:32:38,882 --> 00:32:40,515
their stolen wealth.

729
00:32:40,517 --> 00:32:43,252
Well, as long as it pays like gold.

730
00:33:13,884 --> 00:33:16,485
This scalawag is so Vic Mackey.

731
00:33:16,487 --> 00:33:18,720
Gold-shitting beetles.

732
00:33:18,722 --> 00:33:22,357
Everybody said they've been
extinct for hundreds of years.

733
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:24,968
- A rumor started by the Pickwicks, I bet.
- Hmm.

734
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:27,227
I think we're looking at
a little family secret.

735
00:33:30,334 --> 00:33:32,701
Thank God I got your note in time.

736
00:33:32,703 --> 00:33:34,503
I think we might be able
to actually shut down

737
00:33:34,505 --> 00:33:36,271
this goddamn security system.

738
00:33:36,273 --> 00:33:38,740
If I'm right, this should
adjust Circumstances

739
00:33:38,742 --> 00:33:40,942
in the entire greenhouse,

740
00:33:40,944 --> 00:33:42,811
allowing us to cast.

741
00:33:42,813 --> 00:33:44,947
Let's test it first, shall we?

742
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,319
Not bad, Quinn.

743
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:53,722
- Can we fix the lockdown now?
- I think so.

744
00:33:53,724 --> 00:33:55,891
I just need one last thing from Todd.

745
00:33:55,893 --> 00:33:58,627
Cinnabar, right? Todd couldn't make it.

746
00:33:58,629 --> 00:34:01,329
Sorry.

747
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:03,765
- What's going on?
- Fogg's not who he says he is.

748
00:34:03,767 --> 00:34:04,923
So who is he?

749
00:34:04,925 --> 00:34:06,968
He's Dean Fogg from timeline 17.

750
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:08,870
Lockdown wasn't an accident, was it?

751
00:34:08,872 --> 00:34:10,072
You made it happen.

752
00:34:10,074 --> 00:34:11,673
Perhaps I did.

753
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:13,476
Ah!

754
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:17,446
Take one more step,

755
00:34:17,448 --> 00:34:19,448
and I will hurt them.

756
00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:22,384
Now, please.

757
00:34:22,386 --> 00:34:24,486
Hand me the cinnabar.

758
00:34:24,488 --> 00:34:25,854
What are you gonna do with it?

759
00:34:25,856 --> 00:34:28,390
I'm going to fix things.

760
00:34:28,392 --> 00:34:29,825
I've seen that thing before.

761
00:34:29,827 --> 00:34:31,426
That's the device Stoppard built

762
00:34:31,428 --> 00:34:32,694
to travel between timelines.

763
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:35,397
Yes, I took it from him to get here,

764
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:37,099
then made a few modifications.

765
00:34:37,101 --> 00:34:39,534
Enough to take all of
Brakebills back home

766
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:41,904
with me.

767
00:34:48,203 --> 00:34:50,070
Whoa, listen. Hey.

768
00:34:50,072 --> 00:34:51,371
Look, I get it.

769
00:34:51,373 --> 00:34:53,940
My timeline was a mess also,

770
00:34:53,942 --> 00:34:57,444
but you have a Brakebills
here with no Fogg.

771
00:34:57,446 --> 00:34:59,179
Why don't you just stay?

772
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:05,379
Penny. Sure.

773
00:35:05,381 --> 00:35:06,837
When things start go wrong,

774
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:09,039
just fuck off to the next timeline.

775
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:10,874
How very appropriate.

776
00:35:10,876 --> 00:35:13,810
But didn't you destroy your
Brakebills, and everyone died?

777
00:35:13,812 --> 00:35:16,079
Yes, a measure I took to try to contain

778
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:18,782
the damage The Beast could do.

779
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:20,450
And when that failed,

780
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:22,953
Jane Chatwin got to go
to the next time loop

781
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:24,654
while I had to stay behind

782
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:27,157
and live with the goddamn consequences.

783
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:30,127
Your timeline continued
even though Jane reset it?

784
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:31,194
Yes, dear.

785
00:35:31,196 --> 00:35:33,597
Were you dropped on your
head in this timeline?

786
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,867
You should be well familiar
with the multiverse hypothesis.

787
00:35:36,869 --> 00:35:38,468
As it turns out,

788
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:40,904
one of the goddamn
consequences is I discovered

789
00:35:40,906 --> 00:35:43,206
I have a grown daughter currently living

790
00:35:43,208 --> 00:35:46,109
in my post-apocalyptic
shitshow of a timeline

791
00:35:46,111 --> 00:35:48,912
with hardly any living
Magicians and no resources.

792
00:35:48,914 --> 00:35:51,448
I need this Brakebills

793
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:54,084
and everyone in it to
fix where I came from.

794
00:35:54,086 --> 00:35:58,455
You cannot uproot
everyone in this timeline

795
00:35:58,457 --> 00:36:00,023
just to be a good dad, okay?

796
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:02,626
Watch me.

797
00:36:02,628 --> 00:36:05,195
Fucking father of the year!

798
00:36:05,197 --> 00:36:08,198
Penny, if you're smart,

799
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:12,068
you will hand me that
cinnabar and join me.

800
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,104
Doesn't sound too smart to me.

801
00:36:14,106 --> 00:36:17,474
Well, you can't travel anymore, yes?

802
00:36:18,644 --> 00:36:20,143
I know a psychic in my timeline

803
00:36:20,145 --> 00:36:21,545
who might be able to fix you.

804
00:36:21,547 --> 00:36:25,015
Her specialty is
unlocking latent abilities.

805
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:27,250
She's done extensive
studies on travelers.

806
00:36:27,252 --> 00:36:29,986
And I'm fucking her.

807
00:36:29,988 --> 00:36:30,988
Heh.

808
00:36:34,826 --> 00:36:36,226
Penny.

809
00:36:36,228 --> 00:36:38,228
You're not actually considering...

810
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,597
And get my GPS fixed?

811
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:42,699
Why not?

812
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:47,137
Because everyone in this
timeline deserves a Brakebills.

813
00:36:47,139 --> 00:36:49,941
Yeah, well, I'm not from this timeline.

814
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,978
Wait. Dean Fogg, no!

815
00:37:11,029 --> 00:37:13,530
God damn it.

816
00:37:13,532 --> 00:37:14,698
What happened?

817
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:16,566
That cinnabar we gave you?

818
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:18,101
We swapped it out for cinnamon.

819
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:20,270
Doesn't play too nice with time magic.

820
00:37:20,272 --> 00:37:22,673
We actually got the idea
from Todd, uh, before he...

821
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:27,010
You know what? Never mind.

822
00:37:27,012 --> 00:37:29,213
Now how 'bout you show us
how to lift that lockdown?

823
00:37:33,051 --> 00:37:34,851
The smell is how you knew?

824
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:37,687
I'd read about the
beetles who excreted gold,

825
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:41,891
but we were all told they
disappeared generations ago.

826
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:43,193
Surprisingly,

827
00:37:43,195 --> 00:37:46,563
Bick's all about saving
endangered species.

828
00:37:46,565 --> 00:37:49,599
Ridiculous, sire.

829
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:52,002
Your apartments have
already been searched, Bick.

830
00:37:52,004 --> 00:37:55,071
Obviously, the fairies
never had any gold,

831
00:37:55,073 --> 00:37:57,040
and Bick never had any
reason to hate them.

832
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,344
They are not Fillorian.

833
00:38:01,346 --> 00:38:02,879
That's reason enough.

834
00:38:02,881 --> 00:38:06,016
You'd have had their
innocent blood on my hands?

835
00:38:06,018 --> 00:38:08,785
What fairy is innocent?

836
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:11,755
Um, all of them.

837
00:38:13,225 --> 00:38:16,326
Sire, please, please.
Thi... this is outrageous.

838
00:38:16,328 --> 00:38:18,728
Be reasonable!

839
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:20,697
That was satisfying.

840
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:22,165
I'm so sorry.

841
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:23,333
That can't have been easy.

842
00:38:23,335 --> 00:38:25,602
I know how much you trusted him.

843
00:38:25,604 --> 00:38:29,172
No, thank you...

844
00:38:29,174 --> 00:38:32,209
for bringing a little
honesty to this castle.

845
00:38:35,247 --> 00:38:38,748
Bick didn't make Seb dark.

846
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,817
He is dark.

847
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,919
I like him, okay?

848
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:45,622
Maybe I like him because
I hope he's not fucked up.

849
00:38:45,624 --> 00:38:49,125
Maybe I like him because I hope he is,

850
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:51,261
because I am too.

851
00:38:51,263 --> 00:38:53,096
Maybe all I deserve is fucked up.

852
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:55,332
When you think that way,
it's all you'll ever get.

853
00:38:55,334 --> 00:38:57,067
Why do you care so much?

854
00:38:57,069 --> 00:38:59,903
What? I don't.

855
00:38:59,905 --> 00:39:01,705
But what happens to you happens to me,

856
00:39:01,707 --> 00:39:04,308
and I don't want him happening to me.

857
00:39:05,877 --> 00:39:07,878
I know I deserve better.

858
00:39:10,749 --> 00:39:12,649
Wild guess.

859
00:39:12,651 --> 00:39:16,786
Your mother and your father
both loved you unconditionally.

860
00:39:16,788 --> 00:39:19,156
- How did you know?
- How could I not?

861
00:39:25,869 --> 00:39:28,136
What did you do with Fogg 17?

862
00:39:28,138 --> 00:39:29,638
Can't arrest him, can't let him go,

863
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,073
so we put him in the Clean Room.

864
00:39:31,075 --> 00:39:33,742
He can't cast there,
so at least this way,

865
00:39:33,744 --> 00:39:36,078
if there's something else
that goes wrong at Brakebills,

866
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,080
there's a Fogg I can talk to about it.

867
00:39:38,082 --> 00:39:40,115
There's one thing I'm certain of.

868
00:39:40,117 --> 00:39:43,819
Things are absolutely going
to keep going wrong here.

869
00:39:43,821 --> 00:39:46,521
I have a theory why
magic isn't working right.

870
00:39:46,523 --> 00:39:48,190
I've been studying the control panel,

871
00:39:48,192 --> 00:39:50,859
and there's a readout on
prevailing Circumstances

872
00:39:50,861 --> 00:39:52,227
outside the tank, and...

873
00:39:52,229 --> 00:39:55,063
well, the moon was all over the place.

874
00:39:55,065 --> 00:39:56,932
I don't understand. I thought...

875
00:39:56,934 --> 00:39:58,934
I mean, when we fixed the moon,

876
00:39:58,936 --> 00:40:00,268
it was like we never even broke it.

877
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:02,170
I think the Lunatics were right

878
00:40:02,172 --> 00:40:04,606
and the moon's got
feelings, and apparently,

879
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,659
she's pissed at us.

880
00:40:06,661 --> 00:40:08,795
Great. How do we fix that?

881
00:40:10,966 --> 00:40:12,899
I have no idea, so I'm just gonna

882
00:40:12,901 --> 00:40:15,468
keep studying the control
panel at the green house

883
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:19,006
and see what solution
I can come up with.

884
00:40:19,874 --> 00:40:21,107
Thank you.

885
00:40:21,109 --> 00:40:22,609
Oh, speaking of,

886
00:40:22,611 --> 00:40:25,111
I hear your botanist
friend is doing better.

887
00:40:25,113 --> 00:40:28,114
Not my friend, just
somebody I helped out.

888
00:40:28,116 --> 00:40:30,917
Okay, well, the hiring
committee gave him an offer,

889
00:40:30,919 --> 00:40:34,487
so you might run into him in Botany Bay.

890
00:40:34,489 --> 00:40:36,489
Oh.

891
00:40:36,491 --> 00:40:38,058
Fucking great.

892
00:40:41,529 --> 00:40:44,931
Yeah, I, um... I should probably go too.

893
00:40:44,933 --> 00:40:47,700
Yeah.

894
00:40:47,702 --> 00:40:48,869
Still going to Fillory?

895
00:40:50,005 --> 00:40:51,938
Somebody's gotta stop the apocalypse.

896
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,906
And it's gotta be you.

897
00:40:53,908 --> 00:40:55,575
Penny.

898
00:40:55,577 --> 00:40:56,977
Just...

899
00:41:00,148 --> 00:41:02,015
In my timeline,

900
00:41:02,017 --> 00:41:04,072
I let you go on a quest
to Fillory without me,

901
00:41:04,074 --> 00:41:05,642
and you never came back.

902
00:41:07,055 --> 00:41:08,988
I'm not that Julia.

903
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:10,757
I... I know, I'm not...

904
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:13,593
I didn't just come here
and swap Julias, that's...

905
00:41:13,595 --> 00:41:14,827
you're totally different.

906
00:41:14,829 --> 00:41:16,763
Christ, you have no idea.

907
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:18,488
The only thing you
for sure have in common

908
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:19,732
is I could not stop her

909
00:41:19,734 --> 00:41:22,102
when she set her mind
to something either.

910
00:41:26,107 --> 00:41:28,075
I have to do this, Penny.

911
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:32,612
I know.

912
00:41:32,614 --> 00:41:35,616
I just can't go through that again.

913
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,587
And so here we are.

914
00:41:42,123 --> 00:41:44,625
Here we are.

915
00:41:46,628 --> 00:41:48,896
Be safe, Julia.

916
00:41:50,598 --> 00:41:51,965
Yeah.

917
00:42:03,678 --> 00:42:07,080
As I told Margo, we are deeply grateful.

918
00:42:07,082 --> 00:42:10,183
You risked everything for us.

919
00:42:10,185 --> 00:42:12,753
The least we can do is
to show you the truth.

920
00:42:13,955 --> 00:42:15,656
This way.

921
00:44:09,771 --> 00:44:10,793
- Remember?
- Mm.
