1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,663
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:03,537 --> 00:00:04,664
Charlton?

3
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:07,665
I was a passenger
in your unconscious.

4
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:08,834
<i>Now...</i>

5
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:10,874
I'm still in your head.

6
00:00:10,978 --> 00:00:12,344
But the conscious part.

7
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,171
Whoa, I'm no professor.

8
00:00:15,315 --> 00:00:17,807
Penny, you're the only
Brakebills-educated Traveler

9
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:19,125
currently alive on this planet.

10
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:23,187
Which makes you far more qualified
to teach them than anyone else I have.

11
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,290
It's Fogg.

12
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:28,829
He's stuck in the Etheric
Realm, and it's my fault.

13
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:32,663
Hello. I am Bick of the
esteemed House Pickwick.

14
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:35,868
Grab it.

15
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:37,714
<i>I've been on the inside,
and I'm telling you,</i>

16
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:42,233
<i>it's a goddamn goose-stepping,
Fairy-snatching, ethnic-cleansing Gestapo.</i>

17
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:49,608
Jesus.

18
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:54,552
So, this pig dude told me
I'm supposed to do a quest.

19
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:57,853
<i>Yeah, it's fine,
Todd. We fixed it.</i>

20
00:00:58,025 --> 00:00:59,960
<i>The Harmonic Convergence
isn't happening anymore.</i>

21
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,791
Uh, no. He was
talking about Fillory.

22
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:04,596
The end of Fillory?

23
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,034
So, we saved the wrong world?

24
00:01:14,508 --> 00:01:19,811
<i>Something, something
Fillory A most amazing land</i>

25
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:25,216
<i>Butt-fucked by catastrophe
And way before we planned</i>

26
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:27,553
<i>La-la, bla-bla</i>

27
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:28,714
<i>Fillory</i>

28
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:30,815
<i>A land without a god</i>

29
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:34,090
<i>Needs a brand-new hero
A strapping lad named...</i>

30
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:36,060
Todd, please stop. Okay.

31
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,996
Okay. I just wanna
get this straight.

32
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:42,463
So, Pig Man gave you the
quest in the form of a song?

33
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,436
Yeah. I might have changed
some of the lines, but that's the gist.

34
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:48,705
There's also, like,
three more verses,

35
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,404
and the key change is tricky.

36
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:53,709
Or you could just
write it down. Oh, I did.

37
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,272
The parts I could remember,
anyway, on a couple of napkins,

38
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:58,477
and then on the back of
my hand, but don't worry.

39
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:00,611
I transferred that
to another napkin.

40
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:02,485
But short version... Thank you.

41
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,615
Fillory is in real trouble.

42
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:09,556
He said death is
coming. For everyone.

43
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:12,927
And then he rhymed
that with "smeveryone."

44
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:17,035
Anyway, could you
please help me?

45
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:18,767
I'm not going to help you.

46
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,166
I'm going to take
over entirely for you.

47
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:23,643
Oh, thank God,

48
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:26,805
because I am dangerously
underqualified for this.

49
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,940
I know. My notes
are at Brakebills.

50
00:02:29,216 --> 00:02:31,856
I probably should have brought
them. Okay. So, I'll meet you there.

51
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:33,979
Okay, bye. Okay.

52
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,054
Yeah, no shit
Fillory's in trouble.

53
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,991
Goes by the name
of the Dark King.

54
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:44,293
Or whoever's ordering dark shit on
his behalf. We're still investigating.

55
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,609
Which we were kinda in the
middle of till you dragged us here

56
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:48,158
'cause you were sure
Bacon McSwine Flu

57
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,534
was talking about the
Harmonic Convergence.

58
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:54,631
Oops, we accidentally stopped
billions of people from dying. I'm sorry.

59
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:56,643
Hmm. Look, I guessed wrong,

60
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,770
which is why you
guys should wait

61
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,542
until I've finished reading
Todd's notes before you rush off.

62
00:03:01,648 --> 00:03:06,450
Mmm. I don't need Todd to tell me
which twat's messing up my kingdom,

63
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,648
but if he gives you a clue
how to stop the Dark King,

64
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:10,156
you know where to find us.

65
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:13,990
Oh, and tell Josh to meet me once
he's done with his nephew's bar mitzvah.

66
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:16,690
Dude drops everything
for family. It's weird.

67
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:29,736
Oh, shit.

68
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:34,113
Sorry I missed the
meeting. I can't travel.

69
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,048
None of us can, but we
all made it here on time.

70
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:39,279
'Cause emergency
faculty meeting.

71
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,097
Yeah, what's going on?
What did Lipson say?

72
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:43,852
Well, she's in a coma,
so not much. What?

73
00:03:43,924 --> 00:03:47,088
I don't know if you tried
casting yet today, but FYI, don't.

74
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:48,594
Circumstances are jacked.

75
00:03:48,695 --> 00:03:50,061
Some asshole moved the moon.

76
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,189
Oh, shit.

77
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,824
Acting Dean Lipson was
resetting the campus wards,

78
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,028
didn't realize the
Circumstances had changed.

79
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,323
Fogg's security system
was sicced on her instead.

80
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:00,434
Is she gonna be
okay? From what I hear,

81
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,940
she didn't lose anything vital.

82
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:05,408
Most of it'll grow back. But we
can't even heal her, because...

83
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:06,741
Some asshole moved the moon.

84
00:04:06,847 --> 00:04:07,871
Yeah, I got it. Yeah.

85
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,074
Oh... Oh...

86
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:12,847
Can you shut the
security system down

87
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,079
before anyone else gets hurt?

88
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:17,252
The Dean of Brakebills
can, with this. In theory.

89
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:20,857
Although, that's what Lipson
was doing when she got...

90
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,691
Okay, so what? Are
you in charge then?

91
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:24,597
You missed the vote.

92
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,476
It's cool. I honestly
couldn't give less of a shit.

93
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,470
No, Penny. It's a horrible
job. Nobody wants it.

94
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:32,329
We all voted for you.

95
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:36,035
You assholes.

96
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:38,363
What the hell am I even
supposed to do with this?

97
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:41,313
Well, if I knew that, I
wouldn't be giving it to you.

98
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:43,884
Good luck.

99
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:03,909
Where the hell
could Fen have gone?

100
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:05,204
I know. Right?

101
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,173
I gave her one, two...
Well, several jobs.

102
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:10,506
But the headline was stay put

103
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,810
and find the creep with the
hard-on for hunting Fairies.

104
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,079
Okay, was he afraid of you? Yup.

105
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,918
They all think it's
my time of the month.

106
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,958
Woman or wolf? Who cares?

107
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:27,003
Either way, I've got them
scared they'll end up bleeding, too,

108
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:29,087
so I'm off the hook
for a few weeks.

109
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,462
Perk of marching with a bunch of scrotes
who have no clue how lady parts work.

110
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:33,659
Mmm.

111
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:41,400
Yes, Your Most Excellent
Pouchful-ness. It'll be done straight away.

112
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:44,637
I also brewed clover
tea. Your favorite.

113
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:47,947
Odious veldt marmot.

114
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:49,682
Problems with the
new boss, Rafe?

115
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:52,048
I hear she's a
handful. Between us.

116
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,513
Between us,

117
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,190
Her High Leapus
Gertrude is a nightmare.

118
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:01,854
Who's got the King's ear.
- Sadly. Yes.

119
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:06,058
I took the job with her to try and make
the King's Council more animal-friendly,

120
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:10,570
but that creature is a traitor to her
own. Never trust an animal with a pouch.

121
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:14,736
She's nothing but a puppet
to the King's Chief Advisor.

122
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:16,901
Which is who
again? Bick Pickwick.

123
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,841
The sexist douche
who ran the tournament?

124
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:21,814
He offered Her Long-footedness
a handsome deal

125
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:25,512
to permanently "relocate" all
talking animals beyond the walls.

126
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:29,586
Bick has a deep hatred
for anything non-human.

127
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,988
Non-human meaning Fairies?
- Mm-hmm.

128
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,822
Bick's position
could also explain

129
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,295
why there might be
species-cleansing without Seb knowing.

130
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,093
What are you, dick-matized?
No way Seb doesn't know.

131
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,577
There was plenty happening I didn't
know about when I was High King.

132
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:42,933
Which was fine
because you had me.

133
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:44,516
And Her Slowness, Abigail.

134
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:45,571
Aw.

135
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:47,283
Look, we'll argue
and I'll win later.

136
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:49,218
Right now, we gotta find
Fen, and see if she did her job

137
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,835
and got any new
intel on the Fairies.

138
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:53,747
Oh. I was supposed to tell you.

139
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:56,078
Um, before she left, Fen said,

140
00:06:56,917 --> 00:07:00,319
"The Maid on the Outside
will soon be on the Inside."

141
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:03,450
And by "Inside" she meant...

142
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:04,922
I'm not sure.

143
00:07:05,025 --> 00:07:07,585
At times, she's what the
animals call "human crazy."

144
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:08,754
Anything else?

145
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:11,593
Just that she was venturing
into the Windward Woods.

146
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:14,658
Oh. I'm gonna bank she's
doing her actual job, Fairy-wise,

147
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,267
and not just bird-watching.

148
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,769
Let's find her. You go ahead.

149
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,772
I'll go pursue a
different line of inquiry.

150
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:29,148
Yeah?

151
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,481
Professor... I mean,
Dean Adiyodi?

152
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:35,254
Yeah. Come in.

153
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:39,321
I have a problem.

154
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,689
A very big problem.

155
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:44,859
Someone stole my pencil case.

156
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:48,093
Full of drugs?

157
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:50,694
Pencils. Special pencils.

158
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:54,935
And you thought, "Hey, this is a
problem I should bring to the Dean."

159
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,806
I think there's a
conspiracy afoot.

160
00:07:56,876 --> 00:08:00,074
A league of mischief makers
with a taste for high-end graphite.

161
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:07,644
So we tried to cast a cleansing
spell and instead it made live chickens.

162
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:11,451
So many chickens.

163
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:17,688
So, apparently the fertility and
contraception charms got switched,

164
00:08:17,797 --> 00:08:20,665
so, um, we have
a bit of a situation.

165
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:24,669
They're special because of
their smear resistance and...

166
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:28,651
I don't think you're
taking me very seriously.

167
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,371
I promise you I am not.

168
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:32,969
All the air in there
just turned to water.

169
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:35,208
I shouldn't have to be able
to swim to take astronomy.

170
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:37,216
Go away.

171
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,283
We really did it this time, huh.

172
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,286
Zelda warned us it would happen.

173
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,689
We changed the Circumstances
of the moon for good.

174
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:51,389
What do we do? We try
to live with what we did.

175
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:53,694
Back to basics.

176
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:56,603
Figure out how to
cast again. Magic 101.

177
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:59,605
It's why I'm here. But we
have to figure it out fast.

178
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:01,299
We stopped the
Harmonic Convergence,

179
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,774
but there's still
too much magic.

180
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:06,404
Right. And if a surge happens,

181
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:11,247
every spell already jacked is
gonna get re-amped up to 11.

182
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:13,244
Christ!

183
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:16,084
It's too bad Fogg was
sober when he left.

184
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:23,057
What is it? I don't know.

185
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,757
But I'd say this is an
emergency, wouldn't you?

186
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:32,498
"For emergencies only."
That's not ominous at all.

187
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,805
Based on the locator spells on it,
we thought maybe it was built to...

188
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:38,343
To summon Fogg.

189
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,332
Think it could reach
the Etheric Realm?

190
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:41,957
I mean, Kady
said he can't leave,

191
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:43,950
but maybe we could
get a message out.

192
00:09:44,284 --> 00:09:46,253
Even if we could
get it to reach Fogg,

193
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,981
using any magic right now
could backfire, like it did to Lipson.

194
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,252
Look, students are
in actual danger.

195
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:55,385
This campus is going haywire. No
one knows when the next surge'll hit,

196
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:57,658
and I have no idea how to help.

197
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,699
I hate to admit it, but I
think Fogg was doing

198
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:01,428
way more work than
we gave him credit for.

199
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:02,534
We need him back.

200
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,003
And if this thing can
at least contact him...

201
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,385
Sounds like it's worth the risk.

202
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,740
Okay.

203
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:10,468
Whew!

204
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:13,031
If this shit messes me up...

205
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,174
What the hell, Julia?

206
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,943
I'm fine. Did it work?

207
00:10:19,752 --> 00:10:21,992
It's probably broken like
everything else in this school.

208
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:29,790
Duty calls.

209
00:10:35,602 --> 00:10:38,595
Jesus. Hi. Where have you been?

210
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:40,439
Well, I have to sleep sometimes.

211
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:42,267
And everything you
do isn't that interesting.

212
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:45,735
I think, whatever I miss, I'll
just find in your brain later.

213
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,475
What do you people call
it? Um, binge-watching?

214
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,106
I fear outright rebellion.

215
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:52,118
The best and
swiftest way to get it...

216
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:53,653
To get what? Your Majesty.

217
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:56,984
Gold. Our reserves are depleted.

218
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:59,821
The salaries of our
soldiers and barrier builders

219
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:02,658
haven't been paid in weeks,
and both are threatening to strike.

220
00:11:02,762 --> 00:11:06,130
The slightest work stoppage
could imperil all of us.

221
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,869
As reports indicate,

222
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,436
the Takers are
gathering in force.

223
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:16,074
Which is why I must lead a cohort of
Centurions into the Windward Woods,

224
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:19,340
and find the gold the
Fairies steal and hoard.

225
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,172
Okay, but that
really doesn't track.

226
00:11:23,082 --> 00:11:26,519
Fairies are into
mushrooms and milk baths.

227
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:28,553
You have experience with them?

228
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:30,315
I do, sire.

229
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,256
Mostly bad, right?
According to your memory.

230
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,385
Then you know that they're as
untrustworthy as they are greedy.

231
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:39,027
They have purloined our
citizens' gold for years.

232
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,993
My men and I will get it back.

233
00:11:41,067 --> 00:11:43,662
If I may, Your Majesty.

234
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:45,170
I do have experience
with Fairies,

235
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:47,730
and while they are
crafty negotiators,

236
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:49,672
they're not thieves.

237
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,270
If they have our citizens' gold,

238
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:57,475
perhaps it's from a misunderstanding
that can be worked out diplomatically.

239
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,917
Payments are due no
later than tomorrow's sunset.

240
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,078
I'm quite aware.

241
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:03,179
And diplomacy...

242
00:12:03,256 --> 00:12:05,555
Can always be followed by force.

243
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:07,952
But the reverse is rarely true.

244
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:13,066
Okay, I get the charisma.

245
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,590
His intelligence.

246
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:16,533
He's royal but down
to earth. That's true.

247
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,080
- It works.
- Mm-hmm.

248
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:19,572
But trust him?

249
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,606
Truly?

250
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:26,607
We need five pounds of gold by
tomorrow, and another 15 by the week's end.

251
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:29,308
Or the life of every
Fillorian is in peril.

252
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,613
Accompany Pickwick.

253
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:35,746
If you find the
Fairies' encampment,

254
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,517
you have one hour to negotiate.

255
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:39,556
If that fails,

256
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:44,060
you'll stand down and let the
Centurions do whatever is necessary.

257
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,961
I trust your wisdom, sire.

258
00:12:56,075 --> 00:12:57,475
Whoa. Hey, easy.

259
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,073
I'm High King Margo. We
were all pals back in the day.

260
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,044
Oh, we know who you are.

261
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,349
Look. My friend was
supposed to find you.

262
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,630
I think we can help each other.

263
00:13:07,654 --> 00:13:08,654
Margo?

264
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,615
It's okay, Rowan. She's with me.

265
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:20,932
Ugh.

266
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:24,897
If that's from the selkie
in the east fountain,

267
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,735
you might want to
get tested for the clap.

268
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:29,332
Holy shit, am I glad to see you.

269
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:30,819
How'd you get out
of the Etheric Realm?

270
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,072
Long story.

271
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,537
Point is, I heard your call.

272
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:38,516
I'm here, and yes, I could
use a goddamn drink.

273
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,112
Weren't you sober?

274
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:44,087
Ah. Yes, right.

275
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:47,321
Well, the Etheric
Realm was a lot.

276
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,932
Let's find a bottle
and you can fill me in.

277
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:55,958
Okay.

278
00:14:01,107 --> 00:14:06,341
The Traveler Professor who
cannot travel is now the Acting Dean.

279
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,145
Students are blowing
themselves up,

280
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:15,212
and I presume you are the aforementioned
assholes who moved the moon.

281
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,687
Yes, but I found a workaround.

282
00:14:18,324 --> 00:14:21,556
If you cast as if your
altitude's is 1,000 feet lower

283
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:25,996
and the Pleiades are six degrees
further to the north, well, then...

284
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:29,501
Huh.

285
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:31,831
If we apply this
tweak to every spell,

286
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:37,036
we can teach people to cast without
exploding or turning things into chickens.

287
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,330
What happened to your hand?

288
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,145
I thought the Etheric Realm
was supposed to be a fun trip.

289
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:43,906
Yes.

290
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:47,581
Leaving it, less so.
But I had no choice.

291
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:51,622
I couldn't risk anyone else getting
hurt by the security system I built.

292
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:55,459
Yes, I can deactivate it,

293
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,156
and I will need the
master key, please.

294
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,096
Thank you. Oh, hold up, hold up.

295
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:05,035
I've still got student
problems to put on your radar.

296
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,869
Penny, I have to go
save hundreds of lives.

297
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,375
I think you can handle
a few whiny students.

298
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:13,913
See? Delegating.

299
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:18,013
Look, we got a
common enemy here.

300
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:20,849
The Dark King's goons are
itching to make your life hell.

301
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,786
We've always dealt
with hostile humans.

302
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,621
Yeah, well, this one's got
an army. In which you serve.

303
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:28,786
I'm undercover so I can
get information on him.

304
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:30,906
Which we could be sharing
with each other right now,

305
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,092
if you'd just set your
motherfucker to receive.

306
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,430
Okay, let's dial it down, guys.

307
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:36,969
We're all friends here.

308
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:38,264
Forgive my bluntness, Fen,

309
00:15:38,371 --> 00:15:41,773
but your choice of friends
makes me doubt our choice of ally.

310
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:43,521
Maybe you're too young
or dumb to remember,

311
00:15:43,576 --> 00:15:45,670
but I'm the king who made
peace with your people.

312
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,222
Is that what you think you did?

313
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:48,246
Yeah.

314
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,449
Rowan, wait.

315
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,451
Okay. What does she think I did?

316
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,786
Well, very few Fairies who
knew you are still alive today,

317
00:15:57,857 --> 00:16:01,259
and the rest just know the
story of High King Margo,

318
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:05,264
which, over the centuries,
shifted with each retelling.

319
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:08,499
So I'm being boned by a
giant game of telephone.

320
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:11,332
No, no, no. Phone games
are fun. This, not so much.

321
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:14,669
See, you say you made peace.

322
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:19,069
They say you destroyed their realm
and allowed Fairy hunts for sport.

323
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,114
It's a real potato, potato.

324
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,775
No, it's potato,
po-massive fucking lie.

325
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,718
Look, I found them,
gained their trust.

326
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:29,152
You think that was
easy for me after...

327
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:31,456
what happened to my baby?

328
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:33,024
But I did it.

329
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,726
And then you barrel in

330
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,659
and just completely
screw the pooch.

331
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,630
And not in a good way. Okay.

332
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,291
You know what? You're right.

333
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,131
I... Uh...

334
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:45,701
Yeah, I am.

335
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:48,837
And now the Fairies
need to trust us both.

336
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:51,471
How can I help make that happen?

337
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:54,138
You won't like it.

338
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,455
Uh, that's not right.

339
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:08,519
I know what I'm
doing, if you don't mind.

340
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:11,397
It's a mistake. For sure.

341
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:15,595
I'm correcting spells for the
new Circumstances. It's math.

342
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:17,135
I don't make mistakes at math.

343
00:17:17,904 --> 00:17:22,933
No, I mean that is a spell
for cooking without a fire,

344
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:26,570
but for real, that's gonna
be a pretty terrible steak.

345
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,911
You need flame to
denature the proteins.

346
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:31,076
What do I know, though?

347
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,350
You a teacher here?
We could be colleagues.

348
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,945
I'm interviewing
for the botany job.

349
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:38,254
Hamish Bax.

350
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:40,920
Alice Quinn.

351
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:44,957
Not related to Stephanie
Quinn, are you?

352
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:48,726
We met at a rare flower expo.

353
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:52,505
I found her orchid
quite impressive.

354
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:54,634
Oh, God.

355
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,906
Uh, no, no, nothing like that.

356
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:59,104
I would never date
another botanist.

357
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:04,917
Wait. Shit.

358
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:08,251
I don't understand.
My fix was working.

359
00:18:08,621 --> 00:18:09,621
Ugh.

360
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:11,816
<i>According to Todd's napkins,</i>

361
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,450
there are evil forces

362
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,292
coming from a
distant realm to invade.

363
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:20,461
You think this is
enough to go on?

364
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,134
Oh, Fillory was overrun by these
Taker creatures, so it's gotta be them.

365
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:25,937
So you're going.

366
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:29,404
We could use your
help. I could use yours.

367
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:32,743
Fogg's back.

368
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,112
You didn't even want
to be a professor.

369
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,694
We're talking about the
fate of an entire world.

370
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:40,016
Didn't we just do this, though?

371
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,150
One minute it's the
Harmonic Convergence,

372
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:45,156
then it's the moon
and now Fillory?

373
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:47,559
Can't we just... What?
Sit back and relax?

374
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:49,586
No, but... Come on, Penny.

375
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:50,960
Look, you know what I'm after.

376
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:55,333
A life. With you, here,
or wherever, honestly.

377
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:56,458
Why not Fillory?

378
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:59,095
Because not every
apocalypse is our problem.

379
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:02,201
We just survived
the last one by a hair,

380
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,952
and what is it all for
if we can't kick back

381
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,410
on a beach
somewhere and enjoy it?

382
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,207
Let me tell you something.

383
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:10,139
The world doesn't wait
for timing to be right.

384
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,943
I want to know how
long I've gotta wait.

385
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,683
You live to 35, and
then you get to be done?

386
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,522
Or is this forever?

387
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:23,639
I get you need magic
to mean something, but...

388
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,131
Oh, I see what this is.

389
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,024
You think it's some irrational
reaction to my best friend dying,

390
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:29,625
and eventually
I'll just get over it?

391
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,666
Well, your math
was right before.

392
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:35,503
Okay, but it's
definitely not now.

393
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:38,969
I don't know why, but I think the
Circumstances just changed again.

394
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,780
Oh, shit. I told
Fogg it was safe.

395
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,611
If he tries to use my
fix and it backfires...

396
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,345
I have to warn him,

397
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:47,977
<i>before he tries to disable
the security system.</i>

398
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,622
<i>Julia, I'm not judging you.</i>

399
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,443
You're allowed to
grieve however you want.

400
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:02,667
Thank you for your permission.

401
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,534
Yeah, but the shit
you do affects me, too.

402
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:06,071
I think I can't do
what I need to do

403
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:08,232
if I'm worried about
how it's gonna affect you.

404
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,741
<i>Worry about me?
I'm worried about you.</i>

405
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:12,175
<i>Yeah, that's the problem.</i>

406
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:15,543
<i>So, what are you saying?</i>

407
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,415
I think we need to be done.

408
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,738
<i>Emergency protocols are
active. For your own safety...</i>

409
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:31,025
The hell?

410
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:34,124
<i>Please stay in place
and await instructions.</i>

411
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:38,933
<i>Emergency protocols are
active. For your own safety,</i>

412
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,906
<i>please stay in place
and await instructions.</i>

413
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:43,101
Okay, hurry up.

414
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:45,371
<i>Emergency protocols are active.</i>

415
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:50,246
<i>For your own safety, please
stay in place and await instructions.</i>

416
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:53,843
Looks like you're not
going to Fillory after all.

417
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:05,495
Look, I really thought I
was doing the right thing.

418
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,123
By robbing us of our homeland?

419
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:08,292
By giving you a place

420
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,562
where you and your weird
mushroom eggs could survive.

421
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:13,765
You promised sanctuary
and left us vulnerable.

422
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,299
When your people persecuted us

423
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:18,809
because we had no
way to defend ourselves.

424
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:20,243
You abandoned us.

425
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:25,483
And you can understand how
that would make the Fairies feel,

426
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:26,711
can't you, Margo?

427
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:29,421
Okay, yeah. Of course I'm
sorry you went through that.

428
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:31,469
But it was after my reign ended.

429
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:34,489
You really think that justifies
the harm you set into motion?

430
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:38,723
Jesus. You step out
for 300 goddamn years

431
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,962
and a bunch of gossip girls turn your
whole life into the Nuremberg trials?

432
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,160
Margo.

433
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:45,534
Look, this diplomatic
milk bath is all very kabuki,

434
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:48,369
but let me tell you what
my dad always said.

435
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:50,671
"You can't fix stupid."

436
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:53,302
Skipping past the fact he
always said it to me, I'll add,

437
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,342
I'm not the problem here.

438
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:57,973
And if you don't work with me
to bring down the Dark King,

439
00:21:58,184 --> 00:22:00,153
you're
Olympic-gold-medal stupid.

440
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:02,552
Ember's balls, Margo. Get out.

441
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:07,621
Bick coming. Run. Hide.

442
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:11,858
<i>Emergency protocols are active.</i>

443
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:14,157
Dean. Dean...

444
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,560
<i>Please stay in place
and await instructions.</i>

445
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,301
<i>Emergency protocols are active.</i>

446
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:22,004
Penny. The hell is going on?

447
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,407
I'm afraid Alice's Circumstantial
mediation didn't work.

448
00:22:27,947 --> 00:22:29,691
When I tried to shut
down the security system,

449
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:32,378
it set off all the school's
defenses at once.

450
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:35,112
And you can't shut
it down? I'm trying.

451
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:39,147
In the meanwhile, I strongly suggest
you stay put so you don't get blown up,

452
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:42,528
sprayed with acid,
eaten by centipedes,

453
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:43,961
or turned into one.

454
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:45,697
This is a school.

455
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:48,643
Hey, I got most of
it. But we still need...

456
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:50,329
Yes, I know what
we need. Let's go.

457
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:51,669
Well, how can we help?

458
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:53,501
Stay put.

459
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:55,006
Eliot and I have it covered.

460
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:56,869
You mean Todd?

461
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,742
Yes. Of course.

462
00:23:00,412 --> 00:23:01,710
Isn't that what I said?

463
00:23:02,514 --> 00:23:04,244
Wait. Todd, I just...

464
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,185
I had a quick question about
something the Pig Man said.

465
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:08,419
Of course. Yeah.

466
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,716
Which professor's Pig Man?

467
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:15,156
The Pig Man. From Fillory.

468
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,825
What about him? DEAN: Todd!

469
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,422
Sorry. Gotta bounce.

470
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,532
You saw that, right?

471
00:23:25,604 --> 00:23:27,368
He had no clue what
I was talking about.

472
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:29,874
It's Todd. He's always clueless.

473
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,044
No, I'm telling you.
Something's up.

474
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:35,274
Fogg's acting off, too, right?

475
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,376
The drinking? The
burns on his hands?

476
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:40,964
I just figured the Etheric
Realm did a number on him.

477
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,846
And you saw what Todd
was carrying, too, right?

478
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:47,955
I mean, Azurite. Bondoc
Prisms, beech ash.

479
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,559
That's all reserved
for Major Arcana.

480
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:55,067
Or they could just be trying
to fix the security spells.

481
00:23:56,502 --> 00:23:57,502
We should follow them.

482
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:00,664
And get turned into
centipedes or whatever?

483
00:24:00,973 --> 00:24:01,973
No thanks.

484
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:05,235
Also, no offense, rather
not be around you right now.

485
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:08,813
What? Yeah, cool. Okay, stay
here by yourself. I'm gonna go.

486
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:12,775
And get turned into
a centipede. Fuck.

487
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:18,653
Well, this is definitely the most
exciting job interview I've ever been on.

488
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,258
I don't understand why you're
still hoping to reach Fogg.

489
00:24:22,328 --> 00:24:25,059
He clearly tried your
casting tweak and it backfired.

490
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:27,191
Why we're trapped in
here in the first place.

491
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:28,632
If he's trying to fix it,

492
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:31,330
he'll need to understand how
to adjust to our current situation.

493
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:34,635
Getting the sense you're not a
fan of things you can't calculate.

494
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:37,438
I'm starting to see why you
spend all your time around plants.

495
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:40,070
<i>Emergency protocols are active.</i>

496
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:43,715
<i>For your own safety, please
stay in place and await...</i>

497
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:47,518
Shit.

498
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,312
How do the Circumstances
keep changing?

499
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,458
Okay, what do you
say we forget the note,

500
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:55,016
take down those wards and
go find the Dean ourselves?

501
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,992
We can't even cast properly.

502
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:59,898
Undoing the spell doesn't
require the same rigor.

503
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:04,033
It's like pulling up a
weed with a deep taproot.

504
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:11,477
Just need to get under it
at the right point, and <i>voilà.</i>

505
00:25:20,052 --> 00:25:23,454
Okay, okay, maybe I'm just
paying for that botanist's confidence.

506
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,166
I don't think I should
try a healing spell.

507
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,659
I think it might make
things worse. The infirmary?

508
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:29,304
It's all the way across campus.

509
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:32,321
Okay, can we make
it to the greenhouse?

510
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:34,365
There might be
something there I can use.

511
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:42,259
They were just here.

512
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:44,738
Someone must have warned them.

513
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,711
Search the tents.

514
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:55,047
Search here. - Clear.

515
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:22,981
Hey. Didn't you hear the
order? Check the tents. Now.

516
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,106
Okay.

517
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,447
Go.

518
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,919
Well, well. Look what I found.

519
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,430
He planted that.

520
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:43,164
He planted that gold. Like a
bad cop. Like that show you...

521
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,566
Like Vic Mackey on <i>The Shield.</i>

522
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:48,005
You were lecturing me on
the true nature of Fairies?

523
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:51,370
They've changed,
it would appear.

524
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:58,415
Janet of House Pluchinsky,
what are you doing here?

525
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:01,753
I've been with you guys
the whole time. Jesus.

526
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,182
Women are just invisible
to you, aren't they, sir?

527
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:06,286
Congratulations, Bick.

528
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,626
Now, shouldn't we get this gold
back to our king as soon as possible?

529
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:14,195
We'll hunt the Fairies
down another day.

530
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:16,561
And no doubt, find more gold.

531
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:19,771
Centurions, back to Whitespire.

532
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:25,270
- Thanks for the heads-up.
- You're welcome.

533
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:42,189
Careful. Landmines. Jesus.

534
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,657
Oh! Hey, guys.

535
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:51,894
Um... Aren't you supposed
to be on lockdown?

536
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,530
Wanted to help. What you up to?

537
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:58,303
Ah, nothing. Just,
like, getting supplies.

538
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:01,045
That's cinnabar.
That shit's pretty toxic.

539
00:28:01,647 --> 00:28:06,676
No. This is cinnamon. Cinnamon?

540
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,879
How's cinnamon gonna
help with the security system?

541
00:28:10,923 --> 00:28:12,789
Dean Fogg asked if I could...

542
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:14,391
Why are you acting so squirrely?

543
00:28:14,493 --> 00:28:15,927
Why are you acting so squirrely?

544
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,724
I always act this way, okay?

545
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:22,499
You know, whatever. I have
to get this for Fogg. To Fogg.

546
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,531
Because of the... For
his toast. I don't know.

547
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,572
Wait. Careful.
There are landmines.

548
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:30,166
Thank you.

549
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:34,043
Holy shit.

550
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:42,180
Oh, my God. Did I just die?

551
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:58,435
You see anything we
can use for an antidote?

552
00:28:58,837 --> 00:29:00,305
Is there a section
for healing herbs?

553
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:02,306
Uh...

554
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,074
Look for variants of
<i>Plantago lanceolata.</i>

555
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:06,544
Okay.

556
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,780
Yeah, found it.

557
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:12,544
Okay. You need to make
a poultice from the leaves.

558
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:23,395
That blossom, it's
from a different world.

559
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:26,263
Shouldn't even be able
to grow here. Why not?

560
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,394
Different Circumstances.

561
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:32,063
Everyone thought she
died before she cracked it.

562
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:34,185
What are you talking about?

563
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:43,037
Your late exo-botany professor was working
on a sort of terrarium for magical plants.

564
00:29:43,915 --> 00:29:45,315
They don't need
just water or light,

565
00:29:45,417 --> 00:29:47,943
they require specific
Circumstances to survive.

566
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:54,626
That's to make the Circumstances
match to any growing conditions.

567
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,130
Moon, body of water, altitude.

568
00:29:58,196 --> 00:29:59,630
Holy shit, I think you're right.

569
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:02,877
Wait, wait, wait. You
might kill the flower.

570
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:04,836
Yeah, or find the fix for magic.

571
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,359
Wow. That actually worked.

572
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:32,124
Just shut up for a second.

573
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:33,964
What is it?

574
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:36,524
If Fogg gets my note,

575
00:30:38,036 --> 00:30:40,164
I might actually be
able to fix this mess.

576
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:43,841
So, other Todd tied you up

577
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:45,410
and locked you in a closet?

578
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,843
Yeah, but I've never
been great with knots,

579
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:50,780
so it was pretty easy
for me to escape.

580
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:54,581
Only question is why
would evil twin me

581
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,315
want to get rid of
me in the first place?

582
00:30:58,657 --> 00:31:01,126
Of course. Evil.

583
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,223
He wasn't your twin. I think
he's from another time line.

584
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:06,525
- Wait. For realsies?
- No, it adds up.

585
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:08,829
You know, the two
Todds, plus cinnabar,

586
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,199
which, last time I saw, was
being used for time magic.

587
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:13,795
I always wanted to meet
someone from another time line.

588
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:18,606
Wait a minute, guys. What
if Dean Fogg isn't our Fogg?

589
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:22,006
Describe him. I transcribed
his memoir. I know all 40 Foggs.

590
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,480
Even got nicknames
for some of them.

591
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:27,242
"Fedora Fogg," "Cocaine
Fogg," "Swinger Fogg."

592
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:29,617
Actually, those last
two are the same Fogg.

593
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:31,690
Well, this one's
a heavy drinker.

594
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:33,134
No, that doesn't
really narrow it down.

595
00:31:33,158 --> 00:31:35,992
Okay, he has burns on his hands.
He calls you, other you, "Eliot."

596
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:38,724
He... Oh, poop.

597
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:41,222
What?

598
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,726
I call that one "Psycho Fogg."

599
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:48,468
See, in time line 17,
Brakebills kinda blew up.

600
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,064
Killed almost everybody.

601
00:31:50,175 --> 00:31:52,110
And those burns on Fogg's hands,

602
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,372
they're 'cause he's
the one who did it.

603
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:56,005
Well, what would
he be doing here?

604
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:59,017
Psycho Fogg? Let's
not wait to find out, okay?

605
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:00,881
Let's go. Okay.

606
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:07,754
Just over six pounds.

607
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,058
Enough to mollify the
soldiers and workers

608
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:11,255
for tonight at least.

609
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,758
You're confident you
can retrieve more?

610
00:32:14,566 --> 00:32:17,058
No, sire. Certain.

611
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:20,429
Ugh!

612
00:32:23,642 --> 00:32:26,305
Smells like shit.

613
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,909
I don't control where the
Fairies hide their stolen wealth.

614
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:33,649
Well, as long as
it pays like gold.

615
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:07,008
This scalawag is so Vic Mackey.

616
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:09,187
Gold-shitting beetles.

617
00:33:09,855 --> 00:33:12,950
Everybody said they've been
extinct for hundreds of years.

618
00:33:13,325 --> 00:33:14,987
A rumor started by
the Pickwicks, I bet.

619
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:17,830
I think we're looking
at a little family secret.

620
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,060
Thank God I got
your note in time.

621
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:27,002
I think we might able to actually shut
down this goddamn security system.

622
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:28,368
If I'm right,

623
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:30,806
this should adjust Circumstances
in the entire greenhouse.

624
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,444
Allowing us to cast.

625
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:35,543
Let's test it first, shall we?

626
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:42,043
Not bad, Quinn.

627
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:44,581
Can we fix the lockdown now?
- I think so.

628
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:46,749
I just need one
last thing from Todd.

629
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,385
Cinnabar, right?
Todd couldn't make it.

630
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:51,290
Sorry.

631
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,197
What's going on?

632
00:33:53,565 --> 00:33:55,727
Fogg's not who he
says he is. So who is he?

633
00:33:55,834 --> 00:33:57,996
He's Dean Fogg
from time line 17.

634
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:00,901
Lockdown wasn't an accident,
was it? You made it happen.

635
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,540
Perhaps I did.

636
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:09,238
Take one more step
and I will hurt them.

637
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:15,252
Now, please, hand
me the cinnabar.

638
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:18,619
What are you gonna do
with it? I'm going to fix things.

639
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:20,735
I've seen that thing before.

640
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:23,729
That's the device Stoppard
built to travel between time lines.

641
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:28,028
Yes. I took it from him to get
here, then made a few modifications.

642
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:31,627
Enough to take all of
Brakebills back home with me.

643
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:43,815
Whoa. Listen. Hey. Look, I get
it. My time line was a mess also.

644
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:47,747
But you have a Brakebills
here with no Fogg.

645
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,344
Why don't you just stay?

646
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:54,656
Penny, sure.

647
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,894
When things start to go wrong,
just fuck off to the next time line.

648
00:34:58,964 --> 00:35:00,592
How very appropriate.

649
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:03,726
But didn't you destroy your
Brakebills and everyone died?

650
00:35:03,802 --> 00:35:07,796
Yes. A measure I took to try to
contain the damage The Beast could do.

651
00:35:08,907 --> 00:35:10,273
And when that failed,

652
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:12,708
Jane Chatwin got to
go to the next time loop,

653
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:17,243
while I had to stay behind and live
with the goddamn consequences.

654
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:20,251
Your time line continued
even though Jane reset it?

655
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:21,318
Yes, dear.

656
00:35:21,419 --> 00:35:23,320
Were you dropped on
your head in this time line?

657
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:26,718
You should be well familiar
with the multiverse hypothesis.

658
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:30,094
As it turns out, one of the
goddamn consequences

659
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:32,187
is I discovered I have
a grown daughter.

660
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:35,965
Currently living in my
post-apocalyptic shitshow of a time line

661
00:35:36,034 --> 00:35:38,731
with hardly any living
Magicians and no resources.

662
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:43,935
I need this Brakebills and everyone
in it to fix where I came from.

663
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:48,436
You cannot uproot
everyone in this time line

664
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:49,776
just to be a good dad, okay?

665
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,148
Watch me.

666
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:54,852
Fucking Father of the Year.

667
00:35:55,987 --> 00:36:01,756
Penny, if you're smart, you will
hand me that cinnabar and join me.

668
00:36:02,427 --> 00:36:03,895
Doesn't sound too smart to me.

669
00:36:04,362 --> 00:36:06,991
Well, you can't
travel anymore. Yes?

670
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:11,196
I know a psychic in my time
line who might be able to fix you.

671
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:14,832
Her specialty is
unlocking latent abilities.

672
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:17,068
She's done extensive
studies on Travelers.

673
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:20,808
And I'm fucking her.

674
00:36:24,816 --> 00:36:27,786
Penny, you're not
actually considering...

675
00:36:28,253 --> 00:36:31,189
And get my GPS fixed? Why not?

676
00:36:32,624 --> 00:36:35,526
Because everyone in this
time line deserves a Brakebills.

677
00:36:37,262 --> 00:36:38,822
Yeah, well, I'm not
from this time line.

678
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,092
Wait. Dean Fogg, no!

679
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,419
Damn it. What happened?

680
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:06,390
That cinnabar we gave you?

681
00:37:06,491 --> 00:37:07,731
We swapped it out for cinnamon.

682
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,140
Doesn't play too
nice with time magic.

683
00:37:10,195 --> 00:37:12,721
We actually got the idea
from Todd before he...

684
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:15,864
You know what? Never mind.

685
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:19,515
Now, how about you show
us how to lift that lockdown?

686
00:37:23,374 --> 00:37:24,752
The smell is how you knew?

687
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:27,871
I'd read about the
beetles who excreted gold,

688
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:30,733
but we were all told they
disappeared generations ago.

689
00:37:32,117 --> 00:37:36,282
Surprisingly, Bick's all about
saving endangered species.

690
00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:39,283
Ridiculous, sire.

691
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,791
Your apartments have
already been searched, Bick.

692
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:44,962
Obviously, the Fairies
never had any gold,

693
00:37:45,063 --> 00:37:46,861
and Bick never had
any reason to hate them.

694
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:52,426
They are not Fillorian.
That's reason enough.

695
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,733
You'd have had their
innocent blood on my hands?

696
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:58,503
What Fairy is innocent?

697
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,511
Um... All of them.

698
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:06,174
Sire, please. This
is outrageous.

699
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,752
Be reasonable!

700
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:11,516
That was satisfying.
I'm so sorry.

701
00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:13,250
That can't have been easy.

702
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:15,122
I know how much you trusted him.

703
00:38:15,493 --> 00:38:17,792
No. Thank you.

704
00:38:19,164 --> 00:38:21,998
For bringing a little
honesty to this castle.

705
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,898
Bick didn't make Seb dark.

706
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,072
He is dark.

707
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:32,777
I like him, okay?

708
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:35,541
Maybe I like him because
I hope he's not fucked up.

709
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:38,139
Maybe I like him
because I hope he is.

710
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:40,346
Because I am, too.

711
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:42,979
Maybe all I deserve
is fucked up.

712
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:45,366
You know, when you think
that way, it's all you'll ever get.

713
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,824
Why do you care so much?

714
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,854
What? I don't.

715
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:51,348
But what happens to
you, happens to me.

716
00:38:51,396 --> 00:38:53,922
And I don't want
him happening to me.

717
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,332
I know I deserve better.

718
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:02,001
Wild guess.

719
00:39:02,574 --> 00:39:05,510
Your mother and your father
both loved you unconditionally.

720
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:09,146
How did you know?
How could I not?

721
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:16,715
What did you do with Fogg 17?

722
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:18,748
Can't arrest him,
can't let him go,

723
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:20,103
so we put him in the Clean Room.

724
00:39:20,592 --> 00:39:21,719
He can't cast in there,

725
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:25,024
so at least this way, if there's something
else that goes wrong at Brakebills

726
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:27,030
there's a Fogg I
can talk to about it.

727
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:28,963
There's one thing
I'm certain of.

728
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,026
Things are absolutely going
to keep going wrong here.

729
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:35,272
I have a theory why
magic isn't working right.

730
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,399
I've been studying
the control panel

731
00:39:37,508 --> 00:39:41,036
and there's a readout on prevailing
Circumstances outside the tank.

732
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:43,546
And, well, the moon
was all over the place.

733
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:45,795
I don't understand. I thought...

734
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:48,018
I mean, when we fixed the moon,

735
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:49,446
it was like we
never even broke it.

736
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:51,820
I think the Lunatics were right,

737
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,553
and the moon's got feelings.
And apparently she's pissed at us.

738
00:39:55,827 --> 00:39:57,853
Great. How do we fix that?

739
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,392
I have no idea,

740
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:04,595
so I'm just gonna keep studying
the control panel at the greenhouse

741
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:07,729
and see what solution
I can come up with.

742
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,240
Thank you.

743
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:13,607
Oh. Speaking of, I hear your
botanist friend is doing better.

744
00:40:14,646 --> 00:40:16,638
Not my friend. Just
somebody I helped out.

745
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:20,275
Okay. Well, the hiring
committee gave him an offer,

746
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:22,581
so you might run into
him in Botany Bay.

747
00:40:23,655 --> 00:40:24,655
Hmm.

748
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:27,120
Fucking great.

749
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:34,065
Yeah, I should probably go, too.

750
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:35,599
Yeah.

751
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:37,935
Still going to Fillory?

752
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,066
Somebody's gotta
stop the apocalypse.

753
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:42,573
And it's gotta be you.

754
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:44,567
Penny.

755
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:46,233
Just...

756
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:53,113
In my time line, I let you go
on a quest to Fillory without me

757
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:54,378
and you never came back.

758
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:57,480
I'm not that Julia.

759
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:01,425
I know. I'm not... I didn't just
come here and swap Julias. That's...

760
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:05,260
You're totally different.
Christ, you have no idea.

761
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,770
The only thing you for
sure have in common

762
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:10,631
is I could not stop her when she
set her mind to something either.

763
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:16,769
I have to do this, Penny.

764
00:41:18,443 --> 00:41:19,638
I know.

765
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:23,539
I just can't go
through that again.

766
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:29,453
And so here we are.

767
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:32,622
Here we are.

768
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:36,952
Be safe, Julia.

769
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:40,897
Yeah.

770
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:56,175
As I told Margo, we
are deeply grateful.

771
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:58,441
You risked everything for us.

772
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,679
The least we can do
is to show you the truth.

773
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:04,554
This way.

774
00:43:43,521 --> 00:43:47,151
<i>The evil forces
enter a forest glade</i>

775
00:43:47,258 --> 00:43:50,990
<i>Coming from a
distant realm to invade</i>

776
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:53,121
<i>We have to seal
the door of death</i>

777
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:55,098
<i>We'll come for every one</i>

778
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:56,794
<i>Destroying all of nature</i>

779
00:43:56,868 --> 00:43:58,427
<i>Blah, blah, blah Smeveryone</i>

780
00:43:58,503 --> 00:43:59,664
Remember? JULIA: Mmm-hmm.

781
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:01,136
<i>The horny, horny...</i>
