1
00:00:06,397 --> 00:00:08,138
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:09,272 --> 00:00:10,577
Charlton?

3
00:00:10,621 --> 00:00:13,667
I was a passenger
in your unconscious.

4
00:00:13,711 --> 00:00:16,844
Now I'm still in your head...

5
00:00:16,888 --> 00:00:18,585
But the conscious part.

6
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:21,197
Whoa, I... I'm...
I'm no professor.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,764
Penny, you're the only
Brakebills-educated traveler

8
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,462
currently alive on this planet,

9
00:00:25,505 --> 00:00:27,464
which makes you far more
qualified to teach them

10
00:00:27,507 --> 00:00:28,856
than anyone else I have.

11
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:30,206
It's Fogg.

12
00:00:30,249 --> 00:00:31,529
He's stuck in the Etheric Realm,

13
00:00:31,555 --> 00:00:34,775
and it's my fault.

14
00:00:34,819 --> 00:00:35,950
Hello.

15
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,605
I am Bick of the esteemed
House Pickwick.

16
00:00:40,825 --> 00:00:43,654
I've been on the inside,
and I'm telling you

17
00:00:43,697 --> 00:00:45,308
it's a goddamn goose-stepping,

18
00:00:45,351 --> 00:00:48,659
fairy-snatching,
ethnic cleansing Gestapo.

19
00:00:53,968 --> 00:00:56,667
Jesus.

20
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:00,584
So this pig dude told me
I'm supposed to do a quest?

21
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:03,717
- Yeah, it's fine, Todd.
- We fixed it.

22
00:01:03,761 --> 00:01:05,850
The Harmonic Convergence
isn't happening anymore.

23
00:01:05,893 --> 00:01:08,766
- Uh, no.
- He was talking about Fillory.

24
00:01:08,809 --> 00:01:10,855
The end of Fillory?

25
00:01:10,898 --> 00:01:13,640
So we saved the wrong world?

26
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:22,997
♪ Something, something,
Fillory ♪

27
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:26,305
♪ A most amazing land

28
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:31,745
♪ Butt-fucked by catastrophe,
and way before we planned ♪

29
00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:34,444
♪ La, la, blah, blah, Fillory

30
00:01:34,487 --> 00:01:37,229
♪ A land without a god

31
00:01:37,273 --> 00:01:40,232
♪ Needs a brand-new hero,
a strapping lad named... ♪

32
00:01:40,276 --> 00:01:42,669
- Todd, please stop.
- Okay.

33
00:01:42,713 --> 00:01:45,324
- Okay.
- Just wanna get this straight.

34
00:01:45,368 --> 00:01:48,501
So Pig Man gave you the quest
in the form of a song?

35
00:01:48,545 --> 00:01:49,589
Yeah.

36
00:01:49,633 --> 00:01:51,243
I might have changed
some of the lines,

37
00:01:51,287 --> 00:01:52,723
but that's the gist.

38
00:01:52,766 --> 00:01:54,681
There's also, like,
three more verses,

39
00:01:54,725 --> 00:01:56,422
and the key change is tricky.

40
00:01:57,554 --> 00:01:58,705
Or you could just write it down.

41
00:01:58,729 --> 00:01:59,730
Oh, I did.

42
00:01:59,773 --> 00:02:01,340
The parts I could
remember, anyway,

43
00:02:01,384 --> 00:02:02,341
on a couple of napkins

44
00:02:02,385 --> 00:02:03,690
and then on the back of my hand,

45
00:02:03,734 --> 00:02:04,735
but don't worry.

46
00:02:04,778 --> 00:02:06,650
I transferred that
to another napkin.

47
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,739
- But short version...
- Thank you.

48
00:02:08,782 --> 00:02:11,263
Fillory is in real trouble.

49
00:02:11,307 --> 00:02:14,440
He said death is coming

50
00:02:14,484 --> 00:02:16,399
for everyone.

51
00:02:16,442 --> 00:02:19,967
And then he rhymed that
with "smeveryone."

52
00:02:20,011 --> 00:02:23,014
Anyway,
could you please help me?

53
00:02:23,057 --> 00:02:25,973
I'm not going to help you.

54
00:02:26,017 --> 00:02:28,280
I'm going to take over
entirely for you.

55
00:02:28,324 --> 00:02:29,673
Oh, thank God,

56
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:32,763
because I am dangerously
underqualified for this.

57
00:02:32,806 --> 00:02:33,764
I know.

58
00:02:33,807 --> 00:02:34,915
My notes are at Brakebills.

59
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:36,462
I probably should've
brought 'em.

60
00:02:36,506 --> 00:02:38,595
Okay, so I'll meet you there.

61
00:02:38,638 --> 00:02:40,640
- Kay, bye.
- Okay.

62
00:02:43,382 --> 00:02:45,036
Yeah, no shit,
Fillory's in trouble.

63
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,820
Goes by the name
of the Dark King.

64
00:02:46,864 --> 00:02:49,040
Or whoever's ordering
dark shit on his behalf.

65
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:50,389
We're still investigating.

66
00:02:50,433 --> 00:02:51,758
Which we were kind
of in the middle of

67
00:02:51,782 --> 00:02:53,325
till you dragged us here
'cause you were sure

68
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:54,741
Bacon McSwine-Flu
was talking about

69
00:02:54,785 --> 00:02:56,569
the Harmonic Convergence.

70
00:02:56,613 --> 00:02:59,746
Oops, we accidentally stopped
billions of people from dying.

71
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,487
- I'm sorry.
- Hmm.

72
00:03:01,531 --> 00:03:02,662
Look, I guessed wrong,

73
00:03:02,706 --> 00:03:04,708
which is why you guys
should wait

74
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,363
until I finish reading Todd's
notes before you rush off.

75
00:03:07,406 --> 00:03:09,365
Mm, I don't need Todd

76
00:03:09,408 --> 00:03:12,411
to tell me which twat's
messing up my kingdom.

77
00:03:12,455 --> 00:03:14,520
But if he gives you a clue
how to stop the Dark King,

78
00:03:14,544 --> 00:03:15,564
you know where to find us.

79
00:03:15,588 --> 00:03:17,503
Oh, and tell Josh to meet me

80
00:03:17,547 --> 00:03:19,810
once he's done with
his nephew's bar mitzvah.

81
00:03:19,853 --> 00:03:21,638
Dude drops everything
for family.

82
00:03:21,681 --> 00:03:22,900
It's weird.

83
00:03:34,085 --> 00:03:35,826
Oh, shit.

84
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,003
Uh, sorry I missed the meeting.

85
00:03:39,046 --> 00:03:41,092
I can't travel, and...
None of us can.

86
00:03:41,135 --> 00:03:42,963
We all made it here on time,

87
00:03:43,007 --> 00:03:45,531
'cause "emergency
faculty meeting."

88
00:03:45,575 --> 00:03:46,813
- Yeah, what's going on?
- What did Lipson say?

89
00:03:46,837 --> 00:03:48,055
Well, she's in a coma,

90
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:49,796
- so not much.
- What?

91
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,600
I don't know if you tried
casting yet today,

92
00:03:51,624 --> 00:03:53,017
but FYI: don't.

93
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,540
Circumstances are jacked.

94
00:03:54,584 --> 00:03:56,847
- Some asshole moved the moon.
- Oh, shit.

95
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:59,763
Acting Dean Lipson
was resetting the campus wards,

96
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:01,982
didn't realize
the Circumstances had changed.

97
00:04:02,026 --> 00:04:04,376
Fogg's security system
was sicced on her instead.

98
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,508
Is she gonna be okay?

99
00:04:05,551 --> 00:04:06,509
From what I hear,

100
00:04:06,552 --> 00:04:07,988
she didn't lose anything vital.

101
00:04:08,032 --> 00:04:09,555
Most of it'll grow back,

102
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:10,879
but we can't even heal her be...

103
00:04:10,904 --> 00:04:12,645
Because some asshole
moved the moon.

104
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:13,864
- Yeah, I got it.
- Yeah.

105
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,738
Can you shut
the security system down

106
00:04:18,782 --> 00:04:20,131
before anyone else gets hurt?

107
00:04:20,174 --> 00:04:23,395
The Dean of Brakebills can
with this, in theory.

108
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:26,572
Although, that's what Lipson
was doing when she got...

109
00:04:26,616 --> 00:04:27,660
Okay, so what?

110
00:04:27,704 --> 00:04:29,532
Are you in charge then?

111
00:04:29,575 --> 00:04:31,098
- You missed the boat.
- Oh, it's cool.

112
00:04:31,142 --> 00:04:32,685
I honestly couldn't give
less of a shit.

113
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:34,537
- No, Penny.
- It's a horrible job.

114
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,538
Nobody wants it.

115
00:04:35,581 --> 00:04:38,541
We all voted for you.

116
00:04:39,193 --> 00:04:42,458
You assholes.

117
00:04:42,501 --> 00:04:44,416
The hell am I even
supposed to do with this?

118
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,765
Well, if I knew that,

119
00:04:45,809 --> 00:04:47,419
I wouldn't be giving it to you.

120
00:04:47,463 --> 00:04:49,769
Good luck.

121
00:05:08,048 --> 00:05:09,702
Where the hell
could Fen have gone?

122
00:05:09,746 --> 00:05:11,051
I know, right?

123
00:05:11,095 --> 00:05:12,836
I gave her one... two...

124
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,795
well, several jobs,
but the headline was

125
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,144
"stay put and find the creep

126
00:05:17,188 --> 00:05:18,711
with the hard-on
for hunting fairies."

127
00:05:25,501 --> 00:05:27,067
- Okay, was he afraid of you?
- Yup.

128
00:05:27,111 --> 00:05:28,895
They all think it's my
"time of the month."

129
00:05:28,939 --> 00:05:30,941
- Woman or wolf?
- Who cares?

130
00:05:30,984 --> 00:05:32,962
Either way, I got 'em scared
they'll end up bleeding, too,

131
00:05:32,986 --> 00:05:35,075
so I'm off the hook
for a few weeks.

132
00:05:35,119 --> 00:05:36,729
Perk of marching
with a bunch of scrotes

133
00:05:36,773 --> 00:05:38,557
who have no clue
how lady parts work.

134
00:05:38,601 --> 00:05:39,732
Mm.

135
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:45,912
Yes, your most excellent
Pouchful-ness.

136
00:05:45,956 --> 00:05:47,523
It'll be done straight away.

137
00:05:47,566 --> 00:05:50,482
I also brewed clover tea,
your favorite.

138
00:05:51,962 --> 00:05:53,920
Odious veldt marmot.

139
00:05:53,964 --> 00:05:55,661
Problems with the new boss,
Rafe?

140
00:05:55,705 --> 00:05:58,142
I hear she's a handful,
between us.

141
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,666
Between us?

142
00:06:02,276 --> 00:06:05,105
Her High Leapus Gertrude
is a nightmare.

143
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:06,672
Who's got the King's ear.

144
00:06:06,716 --> 00:06:07,934
Sadly, yes.

145
00:06:07,978 --> 00:06:09,588
I took the job with her
to try and make

146
00:06:09,632 --> 00:06:12,069
the King's Council
more animal-friendly,

147
00:06:12,112 --> 00:06:14,637
but that creature
is a traitor to her own.

148
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,856
Never trust an animal
with a pouch.

149
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,556
She's nothing but a puppet
to the king's chief advisor.

150
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:22,862
- Which is who again?
- Bick Pickwick.

151
00:06:22,906 --> 00:06:24,908
The sexist douche
who ran the tournament?

152
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,779
He offered Her Long-footed-ness

153
00:06:26,823 --> 00:06:29,521
a handsome deal
to permanently relocate

154
00:06:29,565 --> 00:06:32,132
all talking animals
beyond the walls.

155
00:06:32,176 --> 00:06:35,527
Bick has a deep hatred
for anything non-human.

156
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:37,877
- Non-human meaning fairies.
- Mm-hmm.

157
00:06:37,921 --> 00:06:39,792
Bick's position
could also explain

158
00:06:39,836 --> 00:06:42,273
why there might be species
cleansing without Seb knowing.

159
00:06:42,316 --> 00:06:43,666
What are you, dickmatized?

160
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:45,015
No way Seb doesn't know.

161
00:06:45,058 --> 00:06:46,558
There was plenty happening
I didn't know about

162
00:06:46,582 --> 00:06:47,626
when I was High King.

163
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,995
Which was fine,
because you had me.

164
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:50,586
And Her Slowness, Abigail.

165
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:51,848
Oh.

166
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:53,303
Look, we'll argue,
and I'll win later.

167
00:06:53,327 --> 00:06:55,175
Right now we gotta find Fen
and see if she did her job

168
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,636
and got any new Intel
on the fairies.

169
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,638
Oh, I was supposed to tell you.

170
00:06:59,682 --> 00:07:02,772
Um, before she left, Fen said,

171
00:07:02,815 --> 00:07:07,080
"The Maid on the Outside
will soon be on the Inside."

172
00:07:07,124 --> 00:07:09,561
And by "inside," she meant...

173
00:07:09,605 --> 00:07:11,084
I'm not sure.

174
00:07:11,128 --> 00:07:13,652
At times, she is what
the animals call "human crazy."

175
00:07:13,696 --> 00:07:14,697
Anything else?

176
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,915
Just that she was venturing

177
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:17,656
into the Windward Woods.

178
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,616
I'm gonna bank she's doing
her actual job fairy-wise

179
00:07:20,659 --> 00:07:22,052
and not just bird-watching.

180
00:07:22,095 --> 00:07:23,662
- Let's find her.
- You go ahead.

181
00:07:23,706 --> 00:07:25,925
I'll go pursue
a different line of inquiry.

182
00:07:34,194 --> 00:07:35,195
Yeah?

183
00:07:36,109 --> 00:07:37,981
Professor... I mean...

184
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,591
Dean Adiyodi?

185
00:07:39,635 --> 00:07:41,245
Yeah, come in.

186
00:07:43,856 --> 00:07:45,684
I have a problem.

187
00:07:45,728 --> 00:07:47,860
A very big problem.

188
00:07:49,296 --> 00:07:51,821
Someone stole my pencil case.

189
00:07:51,864 --> 00:07:54,084
Full of... drugs?

190
00:07:54,127 --> 00:07:56,782
Pencils. Special pencils.

191
00:07:56,826 --> 00:07:58,392
And you thought,

192
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:01,004
"Hey, this a problem
I should bring to the Dean..."

193
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:02,701
I think there's
a conspiracy afoot,

194
00:08:02,745 --> 00:08:04,398
a league of mischief makers

195
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,052
with a taste
for high-end graphite.

196
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,667
So we tried to cast
a cleansing spell,

197
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,626
and instead, it just...
it made live chickens.

198
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,934
So many chickens.

199
00:08:17,977 --> 00:08:21,633
So apparently the fertility
and contraception charms

200
00:08:21,677 --> 00:08:24,854
got switched, so, um,

201
00:08:24,897 --> 00:08:27,160
we have a bit of a situation.

202
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,619
They're special because of
their smear resistance and...

203
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:34,709
I don't think you're
taking me very seriously.

204
00:08:34,733 --> 00:08:36,343
I promise you I am not.

205
00:08:36,387 --> 00:08:38,171
All the air in there
just turned to water.

206
00:08:38,215 --> 00:08:41,218
I shouldn't have to be able
to swim to take astronomy.

207
00:08:41,261 --> 00:08:43,263
Go away.

208
00:08:45,309 --> 00:08:47,746
You really did it this time,
huh?

209
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,182
Zelda warned us it would happen.

210
00:08:49,226 --> 00:08:51,663
We changed the Circumstances
of the moon for good.

211
00:08:51,707 --> 00:08:54,013
Yeah.

212
00:08:54,057 --> 00:08:55,319
What do we do?

213
00:08:55,362 --> 00:08:58,365
We try to live with what we did.

214
00:08:58,409 --> 00:08:59,976
Back to basics.

215
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:02,369
Figure out how to cast again.
Magic 101.

216
00:09:02,413 --> 00:09:03,719
That's why I'm here,

217
00:09:03,762 --> 00:09:05,677
but we have
to figure it out fast.

218
00:09:05,721 --> 00:09:07,121
We stopped
the Harmonic Convergence,

219
00:09:07,157 --> 00:09:08,854
but there's still
too much magic.

220
00:09:08,898 --> 00:09:10,726
Right, and...

221
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:12,379
If a surge happens,

222
00:09:12,423 --> 00:09:17,776
every spell already jacked
is gonna get me amped up to 11.

223
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,212
Christ!

224
00:09:19,256 --> 00:09:22,389
It's too bad Fogg was sober
when he left.

225
00:09:27,307 --> 00:09:30,397
- What is it?
- I don't know.

226
00:09:30,441 --> 00:09:31,921
But I'd say
this is an emergency.

227
00:09:31,964 --> 00:09:34,488
Wouldn't you?

228
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,403
"For Emergencies Only."

229
00:09:36,447 --> 00:09:38,318
That's not ominous at all.

230
00:09:38,362 --> 00:09:40,799
Based on
the locator spells on it,

231
00:09:40,843 --> 00:09:42,888
we thought maybe
it was built to...

232
00:09:42,932 --> 00:09:44,324
To summon Fogg.

233
00:09:44,368 --> 00:09:46,239
Think it could reach
the Etheric Realm?

234
00:09:46,283 --> 00:09:47,980
I mean,
Kady said he can't leave,

235
00:09:48,024 --> 00:09:49,982
but maybe we could get
a message out.

236
00:09:50,026 --> 00:09:52,071
Even if we could get it
to reach Fogg,

237
00:09:52,115 --> 00:09:53,527
using any magic right now
could backfire,

238
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,031
like it did to Lipson.

239
00:09:55,074 --> 00:09:56,989
Look, students
are in actual danger,

240
00:09:57,033 --> 00:09:59,339
this campus is going haywire,

241
00:09:59,383 --> 00:10:01,341
no one knows when
the next surge'll hit,

242
00:10:01,385 --> 00:10:03,779
and I have no idea how to help.

243
00:10:03,822 --> 00:10:05,258
I hate to admit it,
but I think Fogg

244
00:10:05,302 --> 00:10:07,236
was doing way more work
than we give him credit for.

245
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,566
We need him back,

246
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:10,916
and if this thing can
at least contact him...

247
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,527
Sounds like it's worth the risk.

248
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,268
Okay.

249
00:10:15,312 --> 00:10:16,792
Whew.

250
00:10:16,835 --> 00:10:19,403
This shit messes me up.

251
00:10:19,446 --> 00:10:21,013
What the hell, Julia?

252
00:10:21,057 --> 00:10:23,320
- I'm fine.
- Did it work?

253
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,903
It's probably broken like
everything else in this school.

254
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,724
Duty calls.

255
00:10:41,425 --> 00:10:43,209
Jesus. Hi.

256
00:10:43,253 --> 00:10:44,776
Where have you been?

257
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,430
Well, I have to sleep sometimes,

258
00:10:46,473 --> 00:10:48,233
and everything you do
isn't that interesting.

259
00:10:48,258 --> 00:10:49,563
I'm thinking whatever I miss,

260
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,827
I'll just find
in your brain later.

261
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,438
What do you people call it?
Uh, binge watching.

262
00:10:54,481 --> 00:10:56,135
I fear outright rebellion.

263
00:10:56,179 --> 00:10:57,504
The best and swiftest way
to get it...

264
00:10:57,528 --> 00:10:59,791
- To get what?
- Your Majesty.

265
00:10:59,835 --> 00:11:00,966
Gold.

266
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,881
Our reserves are depleted.

267
00:11:02,925 --> 00:11:04,491
The salaries of our soldiers

268
00:11:04,535 --> 00:11:06,842
and barrier builders
haven't been paid in weeks,

269
00:11:06,885 --> 00:11:08,800
and both are threatening
to strike.

270
00:11:08,844 --> 00:11:12,586
The slightest work stoppage
could imperil all of us.

271
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,937
As reports indicate,

272
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,417
the Takers are gathering
in force.

273
00:11:17,461 --> 00:11:20,420
Which is why I must lead
a cohort of Centurions

274
00:11:20,464 --> 00:11:22,988
into the Windward Woods
and find the gold

275
00:11:23,032 --> 00:11:26,035
the fairies steal and hoard.

276
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:29,038
Okay, but that really
doesn't track.

277
00:11:29,081 --> 00:11:32,868
Fairies are into mushrooms
and milk baths.

278
00:11:32,911 --> 00:11:34,870
You have experience with them?

279
00:11:34,913 --> 00:11:36,306
I do, sire.

280
00:11:36,349 --> 00:11:38,284
- Mostly bad, right?
- According to your memories.

281
00:11:38,308 --> 00:11:40,136
Then you know that
they're as untrustworthy

282
00:11:40,179 --> 00:11:42,138
as they are greedy.

283
00:11:42,181 --> 00:11:45,097
They have purloined
our citizens' gold for years.

284
00:11:45,141 --> 00:11:47,012
My men and I will get it back.

285
00:11:47,056 --> 00:11:49,449
If I may, Your Majesty.

286
00:11:49,493 --> 00:11:51,147
I do have experience
with fairies,

287
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:53,845
and while they are
crafty negotiators,

288
00:11:53,889 --> 00:11:56,065
they're not thieves.

289
00:11:56,108 --> 00:11:59,111
If they have our citizens' gold,

290
00:11:59,155 --> 00:12:01,113
perhaps it's from
a misunderstanding

291
00:12:01,157 --> 00:12:03,289
that can be worked out
diplomatically.

292
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,944
Payments are due no later
than tomorrow's sunset.

293
00:12:05,988 --> 00:12:07,554
I'm quite aware.

294
00:12:07,598 --> 00:12:09,121
And diplomacy...

295
00:12:09,165 --> 00:12:11,863
Can always be followed by force,

296
00:12:11,907 --> 00:12:14,083
but the reverse is rarely true.

297
00:12:15,998 --> 00:12:17,608
Okay.

298
00:12:17,651 --> 00:12:20,437
I get the charisma.
His intelligence.

299
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,482
- He's royal but down to Earth.
- Yeah, it's true.

300
00:12:22,526 --> 00:12:24,049
- It works.
- Mm-hmm.

301
00:12:24,093 --> 00:12:26,182
But trust him?

302
00:12:26,225 --> 00:12:28,097
Truly?

303
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,229
We need five pounds of gold
by tomorrow

304
00:12:30,273 --> 00:12:32,405
and another 15
by the week's end,

305
00:12:32,449 --> 00:12:35,365
or the life of every Fillorian
is in peril.

306
00:12:38,237 --> 00:12:39,978
Accompany Pickwick.

307
00:12:40,022 --> 00:12:41,893
If you find
the fairies' encampment,

308
00:12:41,937 --> 00:12:44,156
you have one hour to negotiate.

309
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,245
If that fails,

310
00:12:46,289 --> 00:12:48,378
you'll stand down
and let the Centurions

311
00:12:48,421 --> 00:12:50,554
do whatever is necessary.

312
00:12:50,597 --> 00:12:53,035
I trust your wisdom, sire.

313
00:13:01,695 --> 00:13:04,176
- Whoa!
- Hey, easy.

314
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,569
I'm High King Margo.

315
00:13:05,612 --> 00:13:07,136
We were all pals
back in the day.

316
00:13:07,179 --> 00:13:09,138
Oh, we know who you are.

317
00:13:10,487 --> 00:13:12,358
Look, my friend
was supposed to find you.

318
00:13:12,402 --> 00:13:14,404
- I think we can help each other.
- Margo?

319
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,887
It's okay, Rowan.
She's with me.

320
00:13:25,415 --> 00:13:27,678
Ugh.

321
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,866
If that's from the selkie
in the east fountain,

322
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,955
you might want to get tested
for the clap.

323
00:13:33,999 --> 00:13:36,697
Holy shit, am I glad to see you.

324
00:13:36,741 --> 00:13:38,022
How'd you get out
of the Etheric Realm?

325
00:13:38,046 --> 00:13:39,744
Long story.

326
00:13:39,787 --> 00:13:41,833
Point is, I heard your call.

327
00:13:41,876 --> 00:13:43,835
I'm here, and yes,

328
00:13:43,878 --> 00:13:45,924
I could use a goddamn drink.

329
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,450
- Weren't you sober?
- Ah, yes.

330
00:13:50,493 --> 00:13:52,321
Right, well,

331
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:54,671
the Etheric Realm was a lot.

332
00:13:56,978 --> 00:13:58,806
Let's find a bottle,

333
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,939
and you can fill me in.

334
00:14:02,027 --> 00:14:03,463
Okay.

335
00:14:08,424 --> 00:14:11,471
The traveler professor
who cannot travel

336
00:14:11,514 --> 00:14:14,735
is now the Acting Dean.

337
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:16,519
Students are
blowing themselves up,

338
00:14:16,563 --> 00:14:18,826
and I presume

339
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:22,830
you are the aforementioned
"assholes who moved the moon."

340
00:14:22,874 --> 00:14:25,485
Yes, but I found a workaround.

341
00:14:25,528 --> 00:14:28,749
If you cast as if your altitude
is 1,000 feet lower

342
00:14:28,793 --> 00:14:31,578
and the Pleiades are six
degrees further to the north,

343
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:33,449
well, then...

344
00:14:35,538 --> 00:14:37,453
Ah.

345
00:14:37,497 --> 00:14:39,064
If we apply this tweak
to every spell,

346
00:14:39,107 --> 00:14:42,328
we can teach people to cast
without exploding

347
00:14:42,371 --> 00:14:44,939
or turning things into chickens.

348
00:14:44,983 --> 00:14:46,898
What happened to your hand?

349
00:14:46,941 --> 00:14:49,509
I thought the Etheric Realm
was supposed to be a fun trip.

350
00:14:49,552 --> 00:14:51,424
Yes.

351
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:53,295
Leaving it, less so,

352
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,471
but I had no choice.

353
00:14:55,515 --> 00:14:57,014
I couldn't risk anyone else
getting hurt

354
00:14:57,038 --> 00:14:58,953
by the security system I built.

355
00:15:00,825 --> 00:15:02,827
Yes, I can deactivate it,

356
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,568
and I will need
the master key, please.

357
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,485
- Thank you.
- Whoa, hold up, hold up.

358
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:11,792
I still got student problems
to put on your radar.

359
00:15:11,836 --> 00:15:14,926
Penny, I have to go save
hundreds of lives.

360
00:15:14,969 --> 00:15:17,842
I think you can handle
a few whiny students.

361
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:21,497
See?
Delegating!

362
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:25,414
Look, we got
a common enemy here.

363
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,633
The Dark King's goons

364
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,069
are itching to make
your life hell.

365
00:15:28,113 --> 00:15:30,898
We've always dealt
with hostile humans.

366
00:15:30,942 --> 00:15:32,639
Yeah, well,
this one's got an army.

367
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,032
In which you serve.

368
00:15:34,075 --> 00:15:36,034
I'm undercover so I can
get information on him,

369
00:15:36,077 --> 00:15:38,079
which we could be sharing
with each other right now

370
00:15:38,123 --> 00:15:40,386
if you'd just set your
motherfucker to receive.

371
00:15:40,429 --> 00:15:42,562
Okay, let's dial it down, guys.

372
00:15:42,605 --> 00:15:43,955
We're all friends here.

373
00:15:43,998 --> 00:15:45,652
Forgive my bluntness, Fen,

374
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,349
but your choice of friends

375
00:15:47,393 --> 00:15:48,916
makes me doubt
our choice of ally.

376
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,744
Maybe you're too young
or dumb to remember,

377
00:15:50,787 --> 00:15:53,007
but I'm the king who made peace
with your people.

378
00:15:53,051 --> 00:15:54,530
Is that what you think you did?

379
00:15:54,574 --> 00:15:55,575
Yeah.

380
00:15:56,881 --> 00:15:57,969
Rowan, wait.

381
00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:01,973
Okay, what does she think I did?

382
00:16:02,016 --> 00:16:04,932
Well, very few fairies who
knew you are still alive today,

383
00:16:04,976 --> 00:16:08,414
and the rest just know
the story of High King Margo,

384
00:16:08,457 --> 00:16:10,111
which, over the centuries,

385
00:16:10,155 --> 00:16:13,419
shifted with each retelling.

386
00:16:13,462 --> 00:16:15,856
So I'm being boned
by a giant game of telephone.

387
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,944
No, no, no, no, no.

388
00:16:16,988 --> 00:16:18,685
Phone games are fun...
this, not so much.

389
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:22,689
See, you say you made peace.

390
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,604
They say you destroyed
their realm

391
00:16:24,647 --> 00:16:26,475
and allowed
fairy hunts for sport.

392
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,521
It's a real "potato, potahto."

393
00:16:28,564 --> 00:16:30,958
No, it's "potato,
Po-massive-fucking-lie."

394
00:16:31,002 --> 00:16:34,005
Look, I found them,
gained their trust.

395
00:16:34,048 --> 00:16:38,792
You think that was easy for me
after what happened to my baby?

396
00:16:38,835 --> 00:16:40,533
But I did it.

397
00:16:40,576 --> 00:16:43,971
And then you barrel in and just
completely screw the pooch.

398
00:16:44,015 --> 00:16:46,800
- And not in a good way.
- Okay.

399
00:16:46,843 --> 00:16:48,541
You know what?
You're right.

400
00:16:48,584 --> 00:16:51,936
I... uh, yeah.

401
00:16:51,979 --> 00:16:53,198
I am.

402
00:16:53,241 --> 00:16:56,810
But now the fairies
need to trust us both.

403
00:16:56,853 --> 00:16:58,943
How can I help make that happen?

404
00:17:00,118 --> 00:17:01,728
You won't like it.

405
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:10,998
Oh, that's not right.

406
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:16,699
I know what I'm doing,
if you don't mind.

407
00:17:16,743 --> 00:17:17,962
It's a mistake.

408
00:17:18,005 --> 00:17:19,964
For sure.

409
00:17:20,007 --> 00:17:22,183
I'm correcting spells
for the new Circumstances.

410
00:17:22,227 --> 00:17:24,969
It's math.
I don't make mistakes at math.

411
00:17:25,012 --> 00:17:27,188
No, I mean,

412
00:17:27,232 --> 00:17:30,017
that is a spell
for cooking without a fire,

413
00:17:30,061 --> 00:17:32,063
but for real...

414
00:17:32,106 --> 00:17:34,065
that's gonna be
a pretty terrible steak.

415
00:17:34,108 --> 00:17:37,068
You need flame
to denature the proteins.

416
00:17:37,111 --> 00:17:39,026
What do I know, though?

417
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,723
You a teacher here?

418
00:17:40,767 --> 00:17:41,768
We could be colleagues.

419
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:43,988
I'm interviewing
for the botany job.

420
00:17:44,031 --> 00:17:45,685
Hamish Bax.

421
00:17:46,903 --> 00:17:49,080
Alice Quinn.

422
00:17:49,123 --> 00:17:51,212
Not related to Stephanie Quinn,

423
00:17:51,256 --> 00:17:52,474
are you?

424
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,783
We met at a rare flower expo.

425
00:17:56,826 --> 00:18:00,134
I found her orchid
quite impressive.

426
00:18:00,178 --> 00:18:01,962
Oh, God.

427
00:18:02,006 --> 00:18:04,182
No.
No, nothing like that.

428
00:18:04,225 --> 00:18:07,054
I would never date
another botanist.

429
00:18:10,797 --> 00:18:13,017
- Wait.
- Shit.

430
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,758
I don't understand.
My fix was working.

431
00:18:17,021 --> 00:18:19,719
According to Todd's napkins,
there are,

432
00:18:19,762 --> 00:18:25,681
"evil forces coming from
a distant realm to invade."

433
00:18:25,725 --> 00:18:27,944
You think this is enough
to go on?

434
00:18:27,988 --> 00:18:30,164
Well, Fillory was overrun
by these Taker creatures,

435
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,123
so it's gotta be them.

436
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,168
So you're going?

437
00:18:34,212 --> 00:18:36,779
- I could use your help.
- I could use yours.

438
00:18:38,694 --> 00:18:41,523
Fogg's back.

439
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:44,004
You didn't even want
to be a professor.

440
00:18:44,048 --> 00:18:45,928
We're talking about the fate
of an entire world.

441
00:18:45,962 --> 00:18:47,242
Didn't we just do this, though?

442
00:18:48,443 --> 00:18:50,532
One minute,
it's the Harmonic Convergence,

443
00:18:50,576 --> 00:18:52,578
then it's the moon,
and now Fillory?

444
00:18:52,621 --> 00:18:55,189
- Can't we just...
- Sit back and relax?

445
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:56,843
- No, but...
- Come on, Penny.

446
00:18:56,886 --> 00:18:58,149
Look, you know what I'm after.

447
00:18:58,192 --> 00:19:00,890
A life with you,

448
00:19:00,934 --> 00:19:02,283
here or wherever, honestly.

449
00:19:02,327 --> 00:19:03,763
Why not Fillory?

450
00:19:03,806 --> 00:19:06,548
Because not every apocalypse
is our problem.

451
00:19:06,592 --> 00:19:09,334
We just survived the last one
by a hair,

452
00:19:09,377 --> 00:19:11,051
and what is it all for
if we can't kick back

453
00:19:11,075 --> 00:19:12,772
on a beach somewhere
and enjoy it?

454
00:19:12,815 --> 00:19:14,730
Let me tell you something.

455
00:19:14,774 --> 00:19:18,299
The world doesn't wait
for timing to be right.

456
00:19:18,343 --> 00:19:20,214
I want to know
how long I've gotta wait.

457
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:24,827
You live to 35,
and then you get to be done?

458
00:19:24,871 --> 00:19:27,134
Or is this forever?

459
00:19:29,223 --> 00:19:30,920
I get you need magic
to mean something...

460
00:19:30,964 --> 00:19:32,705
Oh, I see what this is.

461
00:19:32,748 --> 00:19:34,272
You think it's some
irrational reaction

462
00:19:34,315 --> 00:19:35,882
to my best friend dying,
and eventually,

463
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,579
I'll just get over it?

464
00:19:38,754 --> 00:19:40,974
Well, your math
was right before.

465
00:19:41,017 --> 00:19:42,889
Okay, but it's definitely
not now.

466
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:44,108
I don't know why, but I think

467
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:47,067
the Circumstances
just changed again.

468
00:19:47,111 --> 00:19:49,069
Oh, shit.
I told Fogg it was safe.

469
00:19:49,113 --> 00:19:51,158
If he tries to use my fix,
and it backfires...

470
00:19:51,202 --> 00:19:52,725
I have to warn him

471
00:19:52,768 --> 00:19:55,162
before he tries to disable
the security system.

472
00:20:04,084 --> 00:20:06,260
Julia, I'm not judging you.

473
00:20:07,261 --> 00:20:08,760
You're allowed to grieve
however you want.

474
00:20:08,784 --> 00:20:10,046
Thank you for your permission.

475
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,763
Yeah, but the shit you do
affects me too.

476
00:20:11,787 --> 00:20:13,311
I think I can't
do what I need to do

477
00:20:13,354 --> 00:20:15,661
if I'm worried about how
it's gonna affect you.

478
00:20:15,704 --> 00:20:17,837
- Worried about me?
- I'm worried about you.

479
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,100
Yeah. That's the problem.

480
00:20:20,144 --> 00:20:21,319
So...

481
00:20:21,362 --> 00:20:23,277
what are you saying?

482
00:20:24,278 --> 00:20:25,845
I think we need to be done.

483
00:20:34,723 --> 00:20:36,986
Emergency protocols are active.

484
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,336
The hell?

485
00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:39,704
For your own safety,
please stay in place

486
00:20:39,728 --> 00:20:42,209
and await instructions.

487
00:20:42,253 --> 00:20:44,733
Emergency protocols are active.

488
00:20:44,777 --> 00:20:46,126
For your own safety,

489
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:50,043
please stay in place
and await instructions.

490
00:20:50,086 --> 00:20:52,698
Emergency protocols are active.

491
00:20:52,741 --> 00:20:54,090
For your own safety,

492
00:20:54,134 --> 00:20:57,833
please stay in place
and await instructions.

493
00:20:57,877 --> 00:20:59,313
Emergency protocols...

494
00:20:59,357 --> 00:21:01,030
Looks like you're not going
to Fillory after all.

495
00:21:01,054 --> 00:21:03,012
For your own safety,
please stay in place...

496
00:21:11,454 --> 00:21:14,109
Look, I really thought
I was doing the right thing.

497
00:21:14,153 --> 00:21:15,719
By robbing us of our homeland?

498
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:16,657
By giving you a place

499
00:21:16,701 --> 00:21:18,790
where you and your weird
mushroom eggs could survive.

500
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:21,967
You promised sanctuary
and left us vulnerable.

501
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,622
When your people persecuted us

502
00:21:24,665 --> 00:21:26,885
because we had no way
to defend ourselves,

503
00:21:26,928 --> 00:21:29,322
you abandoned us.

504
00:21:29,365 --> 00:21:31,933
And you can understand

505
00:21:31,977 --> 00:21:34,936
how that would make the fairies
feel, can't you, Margo?

506
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,155
Okay, yeah, of course

507
00:21:36,198 --> 00:21:38,244
I'm sorry you went through that,

508
00:21:38,287 --> 00:21:39,680
but it was after my reign ended.

509
00:21:39,724 --> 00:21:41,116
You really think that justifies

510
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,683
the harm you set into motion?

511
00:21:42,727 --> 00:21:44,859
Jesus.

512
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:46,905
You step out
for 300 goddamn years,

513
00:21:46,948 --> 00:21:48,210
and a bunch of gossip girls

514
00:21:48,254 --> 00:21:50,094
turn your whole life
into the Nuremberg trials?

515
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:51,518
Margo.

516
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:54,695
Look, this diplomatic
milk bath is all very kabuki,

517
00:21:54,739 --> 00:21:56,697
but let me tell you
what my dad always said.

518
00:21:56,741 --> 00:21:58,786
"You can't fix stupid."

519
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,701
Skipping past the fact
he always said it to me,

520
00:22:00,745 --> 00:22:03,225
I'll add,
I'm not the problem here,

521
00:22:03,269 --> 00:22:06,141
and if you don't work with me
to bring down the Dark King,

522
00:22:06,185 --> 00:22:08,100
you're Olympic-gold-medal
stupid.

523
00:22:08,143 --> 00:22:10,798
- Ember's balls, Margo.
- Get out.

524
00:22:13,061 --> 00:22:15,890
Bick coming!
Run, hide!

525
00:22:17,762 --> 00:22:20,199
Emergency protocols are active.

526
00:22:20,242 --> 00:22:22,288
Dean. Dean!

527
00:22:22,331 --> 00:22:25,030
And await instructions.

528
00:22:25,073 --> 00:22:28,163
Emergency protocols are active.

529
00:22:28,207 --> 00:22:30,209
- Penny.
- The hell is going on?

530
00:22:32,472 --> 00:22:34,735
I'm afraid Alice's
circumstantial mediation

531
00:22:34,779 --> 00:22:36,084
didn't work.

532
00:22:36,128 --> 00:22:37,801
When I tried to shut down
the security system,

533
00:22:37,825 --> 00:22:40,741
it set off all the school's
defenses at once.

534
00:22:40,785 --> 00:22:43,265
- And you can't shut it down?
- I'm trying.

535
00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:45,746
In the meanwhile,
I strongly suggest you stay put

536
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:48,923
so you don't get blown up
and sprayed with acid,

537
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:51,752
eaten by centipedes,
or turned into one.

538
00:22:51,796 --> 00:22:53,798
This is a school.

539
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,757
Hey, got most of it,
but we still need to...

540
00:22:56,801 --> 00:22:58,324
- Yes, I know what we need.
- Let's go.

541
00:22:58,367 --> 00:22:59,891
Well, how can we help?

542
00:22:59,934 --> 00:23:01,414
Stay put.

543
00:23:01,457 --> 00:23:03,198
Eliot and I have it covered.

544
00:23:03,242 --> 00:23:05,113
You mean Todd?

545
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,464
- Y... yes.
- Of course.

546
00:23:08,508 --> 00:23:09,944
Isn't that what I said?

547
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:11,816
Oh, wait, Todd.

548
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:13,426
I just had a quick question,

549
00:23:13,469 --> 00:23:15,297
uh, about something
the Pig Man said.

550
00:23:15,341 --> 00:23:16,777
Of course, yeah.

551
00:23:16,821 --> 00:23:19,867
Which professor's Pig Man?

552
00:23:19,911 --> 00:23:23,392
- The Pig Man.
- From Fillory?

553
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:25,830
- What about him?
- Todd!

554
00:23:25,873 --> 00:23:27,832
Sorry, gotta bounce.

555
00:23:29,921 --> 00:23:33,272
You saw that, right?

556
00:23:33,315 --> 00:23:35,491
He had no clue
what I was talking about.

557
00:23:35,535 --> 00:23:38,059
- It's Todd.
- He's always clueless.

558
00:23:38,103 --> 00:23:40,496
No, I'm telling you
something's up.

559
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:44,109
I mean, Fogg's acting off,
too, right?

560
00:23:44,152 --> 00:23:46,807
The drinking,
the burns on his hands.

561
00:23:46,851 --> 00:23:49,114
I just figured the Etheric
Realm did a number on him.

562
00:23:49,157 --> 00:23:52,900
You saw what Todd
was carrying, too, right?

563
00:23:52,944 --> 00:23:57,209
I mean, Azurite,
Bondoc Prisms, beech ash.

564
00:23:57,252 --> 00:23:59,820
That's all reserved
for Major Arcana.

565
00:23:59,864 --> 00:24:04,216
Or they could just be trying
to fix the security spells.

566
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:05,826
We should follow them.

567
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,481
And get turned into
centipedes or whatever?

568
00:24:08,524 --> 00:24:10,396
No, thanks.

569
00:24:10,439 --> 00:24:11,919
Also, no offense,

570
00:24:11,963 --> 00:24:13,355
rather not be around you
right now.

571
00:24:13,399 --> 00:24:15,227
- What?
- Yeah, cool.

572
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:18,099
Okay, stay here by yourself.
I... I'm gonna go.

573
00:24:18,143 --> 00:24:19,884
And get turned into a centipede.

574
00:24:19,927 --> 00:24:21,059
Fuck.

575
00:24:23,235 --> 00:24:25,474
Well, this is definitely
the most exciting job interview

576
00:24:25,498 --> 00:24:27,892
I've ever been on.

577
00:24:27,935 --> 00:24:30,372
I don't understand why you're
still hoping to reach Fogg.

578
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:33,462
He clearly tried your casting
tweak, and it backfired.

579
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:35,092
Why we're trapped here
in the first place?

580
00:24:35,116 --> 00:24:36,814
Well, if he's trying to fix it,

581
00:24:36,857 --> 00:24:37,902
he'll need to understand

582
00:24:37,945 --> 00:24:39,140
how to adjust
our current situation.

583
00:24:39,164 --> 00:24:40,426
I'm getting the sense

584
00:24:40,469 --> 00:24:42,558
you're not a fan of things
you can't calculate.

585
00:24:42,602 --> 00:24:44,275
I'm starting to see
why you spend all your time

586
00:24:44,299 --> 00:24:46,432
around plants.

587
00:24:54,527 --> 00:24:56,311
Shit.

588
00:24:56,355 --> 00:24:58,531
How do the Circumstances
keep changing?

589
00:24:58,574 --> 00:25:00,446
Look, what do you say
we forget the note,

590
00:25:00,489 --> 00:25:03,318
take down those wards,
and go find the Dean ourselves?

591
00:25:03,362 --> 00:25:05,190
We can't even cast properly.

592
00:25:05,233 --> 00:25:08,889
Undoing a spell doesn't
require the same rigor.

593
00:25:08,933 --> 00:25:12,458
It's like pulling up a weed
with a deep taproot.

594
00:25:12,501 --> 00:25:16,505
Just need to get under it
at the right point, and...

595
00:25:18,246 --> 00:25:19,857
Voilà.

596
00:25:26,602 --> 00:25:28,474
Okay.

597
00:25:28,517 --> 00:25:31,564
Okay, maybe I'm just paying
for that botanist's confidence.

598
00:25:31,607 --> 00:25:33,281
I don't think
I should try a healing spell.

599
00:25:33,305 --> 00:25:34,412
I think it might
make things worse.

600
00:25:34,436 --> 00:25:35,916
Infirmary?

601
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,396
That's all the way
across campus.

602
00:25:37,439 --> 00:25:40,442
Okay, um, can we make it
to the greenhouse?

603
00:25:40,486 --> 00:25:43,489
There might be something there
I can use.

604
00:25:48,494 --> 00:25:51,192
They were just here.

605
00:25:51,236 --> 00:25:53,064
Someone must've warned them.

606
00:25:55,109 --> 00:25:56,981
Search the tents.

607
00:26:26,401 --> 00:26:27,968
Hey.

608
00:26:28,012 --> 00:26:30,101
Didn't you hear the order?
Check the tents.

609
00:26:30,144 --> 00:26:32,320
- Now.
- Okay.

610
00:26:35,062 --> 00:26:36,585
Go.

611
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:45,203
- Well, well.
- Look what I found.

612
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:48,249
He planted that.

613
00:26:48,293 --> 00:26:50,164
He planted that gold
like a bad cop,

614
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:52,688
like that show you... like
Vic Mackey on "The Shield."

615
00:26:52,732 --> 00:26:56,344
You were lecturing me
on the true nature of fairies?

616
00:26:56,388 --> 00:26:58,477
They've changed,

617
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,218
it would appear.

618
00:27:02,394 --> 00:27:07,225
Janet of House Pluchinsky,
what are you doing here?

619
00:27:07,268 --> 00:27:08,593
Been with you guys
the whole time.

620
00:27:08,617 --> 00:27:10,054
Jesus.

621
00:27:10,097 --> 00:27:13,144
Women are just invisible
to you, aren't they, sir?

622
00:27:13,187 --> 00:27:15,059
Congratulations, Bick.

623
00:27:15,102 --> 00:27:17,452
Now, shouldn't we get this gold
back to our king

624
00:27:17,496 --> 00:27:20,020
as soon as possible?

625
00:27:20,064 --> 00:27:22,718
We'll hunt the fairies down
another day

626
00:27:22,762 --> 00:27:25,373
and no doubt find more gold.

627
00:27:25,417 --> 00:27:28,289
Centurions, back to Whitespire.

628
00:27:31,075 --> 00:27:33,642
- Thanks for the heads up.
- You're welcome.

629
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:49,397
- Careful.
- Oh, Jesus.

630
00:27:49,441 --> 00:27:50,442
Land mines.

631
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,970
- Oh.
- Hey, guys.

632
00:27:57,014 --> 00:28:00,147
Um, aren't you supposed
to be on lockdown?

633
00:28:00,191 --> 00:28:02,454
- Wanted to help.
- What you up to?

634
00:28:02,497 --> 00:28:04,282
Ah, nothing.

635
00:28:04,325 --> 00:28:06,458
Just, like, getting supplies.

636
00:28:06,501 --> 00:28:09,330
- That's cinnabar.
- That shit's pretty toxic.

637
00:28:09,374 --> 00:28:10,418
- Mm-hmm.
- No.

638
00:28:10,462 --> 00:28:13,682
This is, um, cinna... Mon.

639
00:28:13,726 --> 00:28:15,162
Cinnamon?

640
00:28:15,206 --> 00:28:18,774
How's cinnamon gonna help
with the security system?

641
00:28:18,818 --> 00:28:20,428
Dean Fogg asked if I could...

642
00:28:20,472 --> 00:28:22,561
Why you acting so squirrely?

643
00:28:22,604 --> 00:28:24,171
Why are you acting so squirrely?

644
00:28:24,215 --> 00:28:26,478
I always act this way, okay?

645
00:28:26,521 --> 00:28:28,001
You know, whatever.

646
00:28:28,045 --> 00:28:32,092
I have to get this for Fogg...
to Fogg, because of the...

647
00:28:32,136 --> 00:28:33,659
for his toast, I don't know.

648
00:28:33,702 --> 00:28:36,009
- Wait, careful!
- There are land mines.

649
00:28:37,184 --> 00:28:38,446
Thank you.

650
00:28:40,274 --> 00:28:42,407
Holy shit!

651
00:28:46,498 --> 00:28:48,326
Oh, my God.

652
00:28:48,369 --> 00:28:50,719
Did I just die?

653
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,143
Here.

654
00:29:05,089 --> 00:29:08,005
You see anything we can use
for an antidote?

655
00:29:08,048 --> 00:29:10,268
Is there a section
for healing herbs?

656
00:29:10,311 --> 00:29:11,704
Uh...

657
00:29:11,748 --> 00:29:14,359
Look for variants
of plantago lanceolata.

658
00:29:14,402 --> 00:29:15,403
Okay.

659
00:29:17,405 --> 00:29:18,755
Hey, I found it.

660
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:21,627
Okay, you need to make
a poultice from the leaves.

661
00:29:28,765 --> 00:29:30,636
That blossom...

662
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,551
it's from a different world.

663
00:29:32,595 --> 00:29:34,248
It shouldn't even
be able to grow here.

664
00:29:34,292 --> 00:29:35,423
Why not?

665
00:29:35,467 --> 00:29:37,643
Different Circumstances.

666
00:29:39,123 --> 00:29:42,300
Everyone thought she'd died
before she cracked it.

667
00:29:42,343 --> 00:29:43,997
What are you talking about?

668
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:46,783
Ahh.

669
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:49,220
Your late Exo-Botony professor
was working on

670
00:29:49,263 --> 00:29:52,702
a sort of terrarium
for magical plants.

671
00:29:52,745 --> 00:29:54,355
They don't need
just water or light.

672
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,315
They require specific
Circumstances to survive.

673
00:30:00,144 --> 00:30:02,233
That's to make
the Circumstances match

674
00:30:02,276 --> 00:30:04,235
to any growing conditions.

675
00:30:05,149 --> 00:30:07,325
Moon, body of water, altitude.

676
00:30:07,368 --> 00:30:08,674
Holy shit.
I think you're right.

677
00:30:08,718 --> 00:30:10,284
Mm.

678
00:30:10,328 --> 00:30:11,784
- Wait, wait, wait!
- You might kill the flower.

679
00:30:11,808 --> 00:30:14,114
Yeah, or find the fix for magic.

680
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:39,444
- Wow.
- That actually worked.

681
00:30:39,487 --> 00:30:41,620
Just shut up for a second.

682
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:43,187
What is it?

683
00:30:44,231 --> 00:30:47,191
If Fogg gets my note,

684
00:30:47,234 --> 00:30:50,150
I might actually be able
to fix this mess.

685
00:30:50,194 --> 00:30:54,372
So other Todd tied you up
and locked you in a closet?

686
00:30:54,415 --> 00:30:57,070
Yeah, but I've never
been great with knots,

687
00:30:57,114 --> 00:30:59,812
so it was pretty easy
for me to escape.

688
00:30:59,856 --> 00:31:03,729
Only question is,
why would evil twin me

689
00:31:03,773 --> 00:31:06,471
wanna get rid of me
in the first place?

690
00:31:06,514 --> 00:31:08,821
Of course.

691
00:31:08,865 --> 00:31:10,388
"Evil."

692
00:31:10,431 --> 00:31:11,824
He wasn't your twin.

693
00:31:11,868 --> 00:31:13,391
I think he's from
another timeline.

694
00:31:13,434 --> 00:31:15,654
- Wait, for realsies?
- No, it... it adds up.

695
00:31:15,698 --> 00:31:17,656
You know,
the two Todds plus cinnabar,

696
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,398
which last time I saw,
was being used for time magic.

697
00:31:20,441 --> 00:31:22,835
I always wanted to meet
someone from another timeline.

698
00:31:22,879 --> 00:31:24,097
Wait a minute, guys.

699
00:31:24,141 --> 00:31:27,840
What if Dean Fogg
isn't our Fogg?

700
00:31:27,884 --> 00:31:29,712
- Describe him.
- I transcribed his memoir.

701
00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:31,235
I know all 40 Foggs.

702
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:32,516
Even got nicknames
for some of them.

703
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,238
Fedora Fogg,

704
00:31:34,281 --> 00:31:36,327
Cocaine Fogg, Swinger Fogg...

705
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:38,546
actually, those last two
are the same Fogg.

706
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,766
Uh, well, this one's
a heavy drinker.

707
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:42,265
No, that doesn't really
narrow it down.

708
00:31:42,289 --> 00:31:43,353
- Okay.
- He has burns on his hands.

709
00:31:43,377 --> 00:31:45,205
He calls you...
other you "Eliot."

710
00:31:45,249 --> 00:31:47,120
He has...
Ohh.

711
00:31:47,164 --> 00:31:48,556
Poop.

712
00:31:49,514 --> 00:31:50,515
What?

713
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:53,779
I call that one Psycho Fogg.

714
00:31:53,823 --> 00:31:57,478
See, in timeline 17,
Brakebills kinda blew up.

715
00:31:57,522 --> 00:31:59,219
Killed almost everybody.

716
00:31:59,263 --> 00:32:01,308
And those burns
on Fogg's hands...

717
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:03,528
They're kinda 'cause
he's the one who did it.

718
00:32:03,571 --> 00:32:04,853
Well, what would
he be doing here?

719
00:32:04,877 --> 00:32:06,357
Psycho Fogg?

720
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,272
Let's not wait
to find out, okay?

721
00:32:08,315 --> 00:32:10,274
- Let's go.
- Ah, okay.

722
00:32:15,192 --> 00:32:16,846
Just over six pounds.

723
00:32:16,889 --> 00:32:19,283
Enough to mollify
the soldiers and workers

724
00:32:19,326 --> 00:32:21,154
for tonight, at least.

725
00:32:21,198 --> 00:32:22,808
You're confident
you can retrieve more?

726
00:32:22,852 --> 00:32:25,289
No, sire.

727
00:32:25,332 --> 00:32:27,857
Certain.

728
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,468
Ugh.

729
00:32:30,511 --> 00:32:32,252
Mm.

730
00:32:32,296 --> 00:32:35,690
Smells like... shit.

731
00:32:37,301 --> 00:32:38,844
I don't control
where the fairies hide

732
00:32:38,868 --> 00:32:40,478
their stolen wealth.

733
00:32:40,521 --> 00:32:43,263
Well, as long
as it pays like gold.

734
00:33:13,903 --> 00:33:16,470
This scalawag is so Vic Mackey.

735
00:33:16,514 --> 00:33:18,690
Gold-shitting beetles.

736
00:33:18,733 --> 00:33:22,346
Everybody said they've been
extinct for hundreds of years.

737
00:33:22,389 --> 00:33:23,802
A rumor started
by the Pickwicks, I bet.

738
00:33:23,826 --> 00:33:25,262
Hmm.

739
00:33:25,305 --> 00:33:27,525
I think we're looking
at a little family secret.

740
00:33:30,354 --> 00:33:32,704
Thank God
I got your note in time.

741
00:33:32,747 --> 00:33:34,464
I think we might be able
to actually shut down

742
00:33:34,488 --> 00:33:36,229
this goddamn security system.

743
00:33:36,273 --> 00:33:38,710
If I'm right, this should
adjust Circumstances

744
00:33:38,753 --> 00:33:40,886
in the entire greenhouse,

745
00:33:40,930 --> 00:33:42,801
allowing us to cast.

746
00:33:42,845 --> 00:33:44,934
Let's test it first, shall we?

747
00:33:49,852 --> 00:33:51,288
Not bad, Quinn.

748
00:33:51,331 --> 00:33:53,725
- Can we fix the lockdown now?
- I think so.

749
00:33:53,768 --> 00:33:55,901
I just need one last thing
from Todd.

750
00:33:55,945 --> 00:33:58,599
- Cinnabar, right?
- Todd couldn't make it.

751
00:33:58,643 --> 00:34:01,298
Sorry.

752
00:34:01,341 --> 00:34:03,778
- What's going on?
- Fogg's not who he says he is.

753
00:34:03,822 --> 00:34:05,389
So who is he?

754
00:34:05,432 --> 00:34:06,912
He's Dean Fogg from timeline 17.

755
00:34:06,956 --> 00:34:08,827
Lockdown wasn't an accident,
was it?

756
00:34:08,871 --> 00:34:10,002
You made it happen.

757
00:34:10,046 --> 00:34:11,656
Perhaps I did.

758
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:13,484
Ah!

759
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,401
Take one more step,

760
00:34:17,444 --> 00:34:19,403
and I will hurt them.

761
00:34:19,446 --> 00:34:22,362
Now, please.

762
00:34:22,406 --> 00:34:24,451
Hand me the cinnabar.

763
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:25,844
What are you gonna do with it?

764
00:34:25,888 --> 00:34:28,368
I'm going to fix things.

765
00:34:28,412 --> 00:34:29,804
I've seen that thing before.

766
00:34:29,848 --> 00:34:31,415
That's the device Stoppard built

767
00:34:31,458 --> 00:34:32,677
to travel between timelines.

768
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,375
Yes, I took it from him
to get here,

769
00:34:35,419 --> 00:34:37,073
then made a few modifications.

770
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:39,510
Enough to take
all of Brakebills back home

771
00:34:39,553 --> 00:34:41,904
with me.

772
00:34:48,627 --> 00:34:50,498
Whoa, listen.
Hey.

773
00:34:50,542 --> 00:34:51,760
Look, I get it.

774
00:34:51,804 --> 00:34:54,371
My timeline was a mess also,

775
00:34:54,415 --> 00:34:57,853
but you have a Brakebills here
with no Fogg.

776
00:34:57,897 --> 00:34:59,594
Why don't you just stay?

777
00:35:02,858 --> 00:35:05,339
Penny. Sure.

778
00:35:05,382 --> 00:35:06,732
When things start go wrong,

779
00:35:06,775 --> 00:35:08,951
just fuck off
to the next timeline.

780
00:35:08,995 --> 00:35:10,779
How very appropriate.

781
00:35:10,823 --> 00:35:13,695
But didn't you destroy your
Brakebills, and everyone died?

782
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:16,002
Yes, a measure I took
to try to contain

783
00:35:16,045 --> 00:35:18,700
the damage The Beast could do.

784
00:35:18,744 --> 00:35:20,397
And when that failed,

785
00:35:20,441 --> 00:35:22,878
Jane Chatwin got to go
to the next time loop

786
00:35:22,922 --> 00:35:24,576
while I had to stay behind

787
00:35:24,619 --> 00:35:27,143
and live with
the goddamn consequences.

788
00:35:27,187 --> 00:35:30,059
Your timeline continued
even though Jane reset it?

789
00:35:30,103 --> 00:35:31,452
Yes, dear.

790
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:33,541
Were you dropped on your head
in this timeline?

791
00:35:33,585 --> 00:35:36,805
You should be well familiar
with the multiverse hypothesis.

792
00:35:36,849 --> 00:35:38,415
As it turns out,

793
00:35:38,459 --> 00:35:40,809
one of the goddamn consequences
is I discovered

794
00:35:40,853 --> 00:35:43,116
I have a grown daughter
currently living

795
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:46,032
in my post-apocalyptic
shitshow of a timeline

796
00:35:46,075 --> 00:35:48,817
with hardly any living
Magicians and no resources.

797
00:35:48,861 --> 00:35:51,385
I need this Brakebills

798
00:35:51,428 --> 00:35:53,996
and everyone in it
to fix where I came from.

799
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:58,392
You cannot uproot
everyone in this timeline

800
00:35:58,435 --> 00:35:59,959
just to be a good dad, okay?

801
00:36:00,452 --> 00:36:03,020
Watch me.

802
00:36:03,064 --> 00:36:05,631
Fucking father of the year!

803
00:36:05,675 --> 00:36:08,634
Penny, if you're smart,

804
00:36:08,678 --> 00:36:12,464
you will hand me that cinnabar
and join me.

805
00:36:12,508 --> 00:36:14,466
Doesn't sound too smart to me.

806
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:17,861
Well, you can't travel
anymore, yes?

807
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,516
I know a psychic in my timeline

808
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:21,908
who might be able to fix you.

809
00:36:21,952 --> 00:36:25,390
Her specialty is unlocking
latent abilities.

810
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:27,610
She's done extensive studies
on travelers.

811
00:36:27,653 --> 00:36:30,352
And I'm fucking her.

812
00:36:30,395 --> 00:36:31,396
Heh.

813
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:36,619
Penny.

814
00:36:36,662 --> 00:36:38,664
You're not actually
considering...

815
00:36:38,708 --> 00:36:41,015
And get my GPS fixed?

816
00:36:41,058 --> 00:36:43,060
Why not?

817
00:36:43,104 --> 00:36:47,499
Because everyone in this
timeline deserves a Brakebills.

818
00:36:47,543 --> 00:36:50,328
Yeah, well,
I'm not from this timeline.

819
00:36:52,504 --> 00:36:54,376
Wait. Dean Fogg, no!

820
00:37:11,436 --> 00:37:13,917
God damn it.

821
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,092
What happened?

822
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,963
That cinnabar we gave you?

823
00:37:17,007 --> 00:37:18,487
We swapped it out for cinnamon.

824
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:20,619
Doesn't play too nice
with time magic.

825
00:37:20,663 --> 00:37:23,057
We actually got the idea
from Todd, uh, before he...

826
00:37:24,493 --> 00:37:27,365
You know what?
Never mind.

827
00:37:27,409 --> 00:37:29,672
Now how 'bout you show us
how to lift that lockdown?

828
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:35,199
The smell is how you knew?

829
00:37:35,243 --> 00:37:38,072
I'd read about the beetles
who excreted gold,

830
00:37:38,115 --> 00:37:42,250
but we were all told they
disappeared generations ago.

831
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:43,555
Surprisingly,

832
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:46,950
Bick's all about
saving endangered species.

833
00:37:46,993 --> 00:37:49,996
Ridiculous, sire.

834
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:52,390
Your apartments have
already been searched, Bick.

835
00:37:52,434 --> 00:37:55,437
Obviously,
the fairies never had any gold,

836
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,395
and Bick never had any reason
to hate them.

837
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,704
They are not Fillorian.

838
00:38:01,747 --> 00:38:03,227
That's reason enough.

839
00:38:03,271 --> 00:38:06,361
You'd have had their
innocent blood on my hands?

840
00:38:06,404 --> 00:38:09,146
What fairy is innocent?

841
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:12,149
Um, all of them.

842
00:38:13,629 --> 00:38:16,719
Sire, please, please.
Thi... this is outrageous.

843
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:19,113
Be reasonable!

844
00:38:19,156 --> 00:38:21,115
That was satisfying.

845
00:38:21,158 --> 00:38:22,551
I'm so sorry.

846
00:38:22,594 --> 00:38:23,769
That can't have been easy.

847
00:38:23,813 --> 00:38:25,989
I know how much you trusted him.

848
00:38:26,032 --> 00:38:29,514
No, thank you...

849
00:38:29,558 --> 00:38:32,604
for bringing a little honesty
to this castle.

850
00:38:35,651 --> 00:38:39,133
Bick didn't make Seb dark.

851
00:38:39,176 --> 00:38:41,178
He is dark.

852
00:38:41,222 --> 00:38:43,267
I like him, okay?

853
00:38:43,311 --> 00:38:46,009
Maybe I like him because
I hope he's not fucked up.

854
00:38:46,052 --> 00:38:49,491
Maybe I like him
because I hope he is,

855
00:38:49,534 --> 00:38:51,623
because I am too.

856
00:38:51,667 --> 00:38:53,451
Maybe all I deserve
is fucked up.

857
00:38:53,495 --> 00:38:55,714
When you think that way,
it's all you'll ever get.

858
00:38:55,758 --> 00:38:57,455
Why do you care so much?

859
00:38:57,499 --> 00:39:00,284
- What?
- I don't.

860
00:39:00,328 --> 00:39:02,068
But what happens to you
happens to me,

861
00:39:02,112 --> 00:39:04,723
and I don't want him
happening to me.

862
00:39:06,247 --> 00:39:08,249
I know I deserve better.

863
00:39:11,165 --> 00:39:13,036
Wild guess.

864
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:17,171
Your mother and your father
both loved you unconditionally.

865
00:39:17,214 --> 00:39:19,564
- How did you know?
- How could I not?

866
00:39:25,871 --> 00:39:28,134
What did you do with Fogg 17?

867
00:39:28,178 --> 00:39:29,618
Can't arrest him,
can't let him go,

868
00:39:29,657 --> 00:39:31,050
so we put him in the Clean Room.

869
00:39:31,093 --> 00:39:33,705
He can't cast there,
so at least this way,

870
00:39:33,748 --> 00:39:36,055
if there's something else
that goes wrong at Brakebills,

871
00:39:36,098 --> 00:39:38,057
there's a Fogg
I can talk to about it.

872
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,102
There's one thing
I'm certain of.

873
00:39:40,146 --> 00:39:43,802
Things are absolutely
going to keep going wrong here.

874
00:39:43,845 --> 00:39:46,500
I have a theory why magic
isn't working right.

875
00:39:46,544 --> 00:39:48,198
I've been studying
the control panel,

876
00:39:48,241 --> 00:39:50,852
and there's a readout
on prevailing Circumstances

877
00:39:50,896 --> 00:39:52,289
outside the tank, and...

878
00:39:52,332 --> 00:39:55,074
well, the moon
was all over the place.

879
00:39:55,117 --> 00:39:56,945
- I don't understand.
- I thought...

880
00:39:56,989 --> 00:39:58,947
I mean, when we fixed the moon,

881
00:39:58,991 --> 00:40:00,273
it was like
we never even broke it.

882
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:02,168
I think the Lunatics were right

883
00:40:02,212 --> 00:40:04,562
and the moon's got feelings,
and apparently,

884
00:40:04,605 --> 00:40:06,781
she's pissed at us.

885
00:40:06,825 --> 00:40:08,914
- Great.
- How do we fix that?

886
00:40:11,133 --> 00:40:13,048
I have no idea,
so I'm just gonna

887
00:40:13,092 --> 00:40:15,573
keep studying the control panel
at the green house

888
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:19,185
and see what solution
I can come up with.

889
00:40:20,055 --> 00:40:21,274
Thank you.

890
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:22,754
Oh, speaking of,

891
00:40:22,797 --> 00:40:25,278
I hear your botanist friend
is doing better.

892
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:28,325
Not my friend,
just somebody I helped out.

893
00:40:28,368 --> 00:40:31,066
Okay, well, the hiring
committee gave him an offer,

894
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:34,592
so you might run into him
in Botany Bay.

895
00:40:34,635 --> 00:40:36,594
Oh.

896
00:40:36,637 --> 00:40:38,248
Fucking great.

897
00:40:41,686 --> 00:40:45,080
Yeah, I, um...
I should probably go too.

898
00:40:45,124 --> 00:40:47,822
Yeah.

899
00:40:47,866 --> 00:40:49,041
Still going to Fillory?

900
00:40:50,172 --> 00:40:52,087
Somebody's gotta
stop the apocalypse.

901
00:40:52,131 --> 00:40:54,046
And it's gotta be you.

902
00:40:54,089 --> 00:40:55,700
Penny.

903
00:40:55,743 --> 00:40:57,179
Just...

904
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:02,184
In my timeline,

905
00:41:02,228 --> 00:41:04,056
I let you go on a quest
to Fillory without me,

906
00:41:04,099 --> 00:41:05,666
and you never came back.

907
00:41:07,233 --> 00:41:09,104
I'm not that Julia.

908
00:41:09,148 --> 00:41:10,889
I... I know, I'm not...

909
00:41:10,932 --> 00:41:13,718
I didn't just come here
and swap Julias, that's...

910
00:41:13,761 --> 00:41:14,936
you're totally different.

911
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,895
Christ, you have no idea.

912
00:41:16,938 --> 00:41:18,307
The only thing you
for sure have in common

913
00:41:18,331 --> 00:41:19,854
is I could not stop her

914
00:41:19,898 --> 00:41:22,292
when she set her mind
to something either.

915
00:41:26,296 --> 00:41:28,254
I have to do this, Penny.

916
00:41:29,299 --> 00:41:32,737
I know.

917
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:35,783
I just can't go through
that again.

918
00:41:38,917 --> 00:41:40,788
And so here we are.

919
00:41:42,312 --> 00:41:44,792
Here we are.

920
00:41:46,794 --> 00:41:49,057
Be safe, Julia.

921
00:41:50,755 --> 00:41:52,147
Yeah.

922
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:07,249
As I told Margo,
we are deeply grateful.

923
00:42:07,293 --> 00:42:10,340
You risked everything for us.

924
00:42:10,383 --> 00:42:12,951
The least we can do
is to show you the truth.

925
00:42:14,126 --> 00:42:15,823
