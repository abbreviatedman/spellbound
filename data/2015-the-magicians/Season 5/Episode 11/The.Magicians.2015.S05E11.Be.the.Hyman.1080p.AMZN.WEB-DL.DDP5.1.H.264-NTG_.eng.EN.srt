1
00:00:06,397 --> 00:00:08,965
- Previously
on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,489
- The Couple has power.
And they are not good people.

3
00:00:11,533 --> 00:00:12,751
- Give me the page.

4
00:00:12,795 --> 00:00:15,102
If the finger's still viable,
I reattach.

5
00:00:15,145 --> 00:00:17,017
- I'm Hyman Cooper.

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,671
I was a student here
in the 1920s--a traveler.

7
00:00:19,715 --> 00:00:21,325
Someone moved my body.

8
00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:22,631
- I stole this.

9
00:00:22,674 --> 00:00:25,068
Stasis charm--
freezes the wearer in time.

10
00:00:25,112 --> 00:00:27,157
- Holy shit.
Umber?

11
00:00:27,201 --> 00:00:30,073
- You make for an excellent
focus group for my new world.

12
00:00:30,117 --> 00:00:31,814
More of a pocket world, really.

13
00:00:31,857 --> 00:00:33,642
- I will get out of here.

14
00:00:33,685 --> 00:00:37,559
And then I'll turn you
into lobsters and eat you.

15
00:00:37,602 --> 00:00:38,821
- Hey, what happened
to your eye?

16
00:00:38,864 --> 00:00:40,170
- I lent it to Josh.

17
00:00:40,214 --> 00:00:41,519
- Your own personal Margo-Pro.

18
00:00:41,563 --> 00:00:43,173
- Josh didn't die.

19
00:00:43,217 --> 00:00:46,176
He was in the Taker Realm and--
- That's not possible.

20
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:48,831
Somebody opened a door that
should not have been opened.

21
00:00:48,874 --> 00:00:50,659
It could mean the end
of everything.

22
00:00:50,702 --> 00:00:52,356
- I think I can't do
what I need to do

23
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,489
if I'm worried about
how it's gonna affect you.

24
00:00:54,532 --> 00:00:55,620
I think we need to be done.

25
00:00:55,664 --> 00:00:58,058
My pregnancy is going
to be sped up?

26
00:00:58,101 --> 00:00:59,189
- It's Red Monkey Month.

27
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:01,365
Everything goes faster
in Red Monkey Month.

28
00:01:01,409 --> 00:01:02,845
- Wait, so you're saying
that's a thing--

29
00:01:02,888 --> 00:01:06,196
me being able to take on
what the baby can do?

30
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,415
- Maybe.

31
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:09,547
- Well, maybe
this baby's a traveler.

32
00:01:09,591 --> 00:01:14,248
Yeah...
we should probably talk.

33
00:01:18,208 --> 00:01:20,602
- It seems like
I missed a lot here.

34
00:01:20,645 --> 00:01:22,169
- It's actually super simple.

35
00:01:22,212 --> 00:01:24,345
The Dark King,
aka Rupert Chatwin,

36
00:01:24,388 --> 00:01:27,522
is trying to jailbreak his dead
lover out of hell or whatever,

37
00:01:27,565 --> 00:01:29,741
so he needs to get rid
of the guard dogs first.

38
00:01:29,785 --> 00:01:33,136
Hence, using you
as a human smallpox blanket

39
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,398
to kill the Takers.

40
00:01:34,442 --> 00:01:37,662
Yeah, I-I meant
more like...

41
00:01:40,274 --> 00:01:42,363
Contraception wards are
supposed to be foolproof.

42
00:01:42,406 --> 00:01:44,408
- Don't worry.
My uterus is on lock.

43
00:01:44,452 --> 00:01:47,585
- Right, 'cause a werewolf baby
could be...

44
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:49,196
Yikes.

45
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:52,155
But potentially very cute.

46
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:53,461
- Fucking adorable.

47
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:58,205
Some day.
Not now.

48
00:01:58,248 --> 00:02:00,381
I'm not giving birth
to a goddamn litter, Josh.

49
00:02:00,424 --> 00:02:01,469
Besides...

50
00:02:04,211 --> 00:02:06,517
I thought we were done.

51
00:02:08,345 --> 00:02:12,219
- You risked your sanity to
save me from the Taker Realm.

52
00:02:12,262 --> 00:02:14,699
If that doesn't buy us
a clean slate, then...

53
00:02:17,441 --> 00:02:21,663
- So can we skip
to the reunion banging?

54
00:02:25,275 --> 00:02:27,799
- You're wearing three rubbers.
- At least.

55
00:02:35,198 --> 00:02:36,634
- Have you been to a doctor?

56
00:02:36,678 --> 00:02:39,855
- I mean, they don't exactly
have ultrasounds in Fillory.

57
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:46,731
- Have you thought
about what this means for us?

58
00:02:46,775 --> 00:02:48,646
- What do you want it to mean?

59
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:52,607
- We broke up for good reasons.
None of that has changed.

60
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:59,222
My dad wasn't around
for long.

61
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:01,224
My mom...

62
00:03:01,268 --> 00:03:04,227
Look, I'm not doing that
to our kid.

63
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:06,795
I want to be there
for him--her?

64
00:03:06,838 --> 00:03:08,362
- No clue yet.

65
00:03:09,624 --> 00:03:11,974
I want you to be there, too.

66
00:03:12,017 --> 00:03:13,323
- You guys.

67
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:16,848
Um, I'm sorry,
but, um, there's a problem.

68
00:03:16,892 --> 00:03:21,462
We were in the elevator, and
Eliot and Fen just collapsed.

69
00:03:22,724 --> 00:03:24,334
- Hello?

70
00:03:30,732 --> 00:03:32,429
Hello?

71
00:03:34,736 --> 00:03:36,433
Anyone?

72
00:03:40,394 --> 00:03:42,396
- Eliot?

73
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:45,747
It's you.

74
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:48,706
What kind
of Fillorian nonsense is this?

75
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:51,709
Or am I dreaming?
- I know I'm not.

76
00:03:51,753 --> 00:03:52,928
In my dreams,
you're nice to me.

77
00:03:54,408 --> 00:03:57,802
- What the shit is going on?

78
00:03:57,846 --> 00:03:59,935
- Whoa.
Look away, look away.

79
00:03:59,978 --> 00:04:01,719
Still draping here.

80
00:04:01,763 --> 00:04:05,723
- We were just settling on safe
words when we woke up here.

81
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:08,030
Any idea why?

82
00:04:19,607 --> 00:04:22,827
Welcome, High Kings.

83
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:25,265
- Ember.
I thought you were dead.

84
00:04:25,308 --> 00:04:27,571
I am
an energetic emanation,

85
00:04:27,615 --> 00:04:29,312
my dear blinking idiot.

86
00:04:29,356 --> 00:04:31,923
A message left
by the great god Ember

87
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:35,275
to forewarn
of impending apocalypse.

88
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:37,407
I've met this guy before.

89
00:04:37,451 --> 00:04:38,974
- I have brought you here

90
00:04:39,017 --> 00:04:41,498
because you are the living
Former High Kings of Fillory,

91
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:44,762
and your kingdom
rests on the knife's edge

92
00:04:44,806 --> 00:04:47,417
of annihilation.

93
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,962
You do realize
I have other things to do?

94
00:05:11,006 --> 00:05:12,486
- Whatever.

95
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:16,011
I just had to pull Josh's pants
back on, so diagnose.

96
00:05:16,054 --> 00:05:17,491
- They're asleep.

97
00:05:17,534 --> 00:05:19,362
I mean, obviously,
they're cursed or whatever.

98
00:05:19,406 --> 00:05:21,973
But beyond that, just wait
and see if they wake up.

99
00:05:22,017 --> 00:05:23,366
- Should we just slap them?

100
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,020
- Believe me, I tried.

101
00:05:25,063 --> 00:05:27,631
I'm gonna go see what we have
on narcolepsy spells.

102
00:05:30,852 --> 00:05:32,767
- You were not pregnant
the last time I saw you,

103
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,377
like, at all.

104
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:37,641
- Yeah.
Well, things happened fast.

105
00:05:42,429 --> 00:05:43,821
- Everything looks fine
for now,

106
00:05:43,865 --> 00:05:45,345
but I should do more scans.

107
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:46,694
It looks like
you have fast-forwarded

108
00:05:46,737 --> 00:05:48,348
through the first
two trimesters.

109
00:05:48,391 --> 00:05:49,653
You're ready to pop.

110
00:05:49,697 --> 00:05:51,612
Accelerated pregnancies
can be dangerous.

111
00:05:51,655 --> 00:05:53,657
And, it's a hybrid.

112
00:05:53,701 --> 00:05:56,443
Have you had any side effects?
Psychic episodes?

113
00:05:56,486 --> 00:05:58,967
Yes, that I kind of
caused myself.

114
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:02,057
- Yeah, she had to
to get out of, well, a dungeon.

115
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,841
But none since.

116
00:06:03,885 --> 00:06:06,496
- Um, actually, that's not
entirely true.

117
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,976
- Wait, what?

118
00:06:08,019 --> 00:06:09,934
- A couple of aftershocks,
but it's really no big deal.

119
00:06:09,978 --> 00:06:11,675
I've already put up
every mental ward I know.

120
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:13,242
- Okay.

121
00:06:13,285 --> 00:06:16,114
There are treatments, but they
have to be applied regularly.

122
00:06:16,158 --> 00:06:18,639
And the only place that it's
safe to cast right now is--

123
00:06:18,682 --> 00:06:20,118
- The Brakebills Lab...

124
00:06:20,162 --> 00:06:21,903
because the Moon is still
pissed at us.

125
00:06:21,946 --> 00:06:23,687
Look, I'll be there
the minute I can.

126
00:06:23,731 --> 00:06:25,428
We're just dealing
with some stuff.

127
00:06:25,472 --> 00:06:28,562
- Clearly.
Don't wait too long.

128
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:34,655
- As you ought to remember,

129
00:06:34,698 --> 00:06:37,614
I am activated by world war,
pandemic, revolt of dwarves--

130
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:39,007
- Or the mass rising
of the dead.

131
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:40,922
Yeah, we know.
We're already on it.

132
00:06:40,965 --> 00:06:42,097
- Huzzah!

133
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,707
And I have summoned all of you

134
00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:47,668
because the current ruler is
the nitwit causing the problem.

135
00:06:47,711 --> 00:06:50,540
- The thing is he's
sort of unkillable.

136
00:06:50,584 --> 00:06:52,063
- I rescind my huzzah.

137
00:06:52,107 --> 00:06:55,415
In addition to being
just very creepy,

138
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:57,504
the dead drain life,

139
00:06:57,547 --> 00:06:59,462
contaminating everything
they touch,

140
00:06:59,506 --> 00:07:01,769
like a pickle on a sandwich.

141
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:03,771
- I like pickles.
- Behold!

142
00:07:03,814 --> 00:07:07,078
A dead person wriggling
from their grave.

143
00:07:10,995 --> 00:07:14,651
And this is every Fillorian
who has ever lived.

144
00:07:17,132 --> 00:07:18,350
- You see?

145
00:07:18,394 --> 00:07:20,744
The pickles of the dead
will ruin Fillory.

146
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:23,094
You must stop this,
whatever the cost.

147
00:07:23,138 --> 00:07:26,446
- Well, the cost is blowing up
the entire planet, which is--

148
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:27,490
- A decent option?

149
00:07:27,534 --> 00:07:28,926
- I was gonna say
counterproductive.

150
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,799
- Only if you care
about peasants, which I do not.

151
00:07:35,803 --> 00:07:37,892
- Do you want to get that, or--
- No.

152
00:07:37,935 --> 00:07:39,110
That's just...

153
00:07:39,154 --> 00:07:41,722
A mouse farted or something.

154
00:07:43,288 --> 00:07:45,726
A very gassy mouse.

155
00:07:50,165 --> 00:07:51,601
- Umber.

156
00:07:51,645 --> 00:07:53,124
- It is I,

157
00:07:53,168 --> 00:07:56,780
an energetic emanation
of Umber, great god of--

158
00:07:56,824 --> 00:07:58,913
- Piss off.
Nobody wants you here.

159
00:07:58,956 --> 00:08:01,132
- I have heard
your lamentations

160
00:08:01,176 --> 00:08:03,004
and am here to help.

161
00:08:03,047 --> 00:08:06,529
I was designed to intervene
if my anarchist brother

162
00:08:06,573 --> 00:08:10,141
tries something stupid,
like blowing up the planet.

163
00:08:11,795 --> 00:08:13,231
- Do you have
a better suggestion?

164
00:08:13,275 --> 00:08:16,583
- I do,
sweet matron of Fillory.

165
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:18,802
After I faked my own death,

166
00:08:18,846 --> 00:08:21,544
I fled to Earth
and built new worlds.

167
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:24,155
- Didn't finish any.
- Did too.

168
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:25,679
Mostly.

169
00:08:25,722 --> 00:08:28,246
I intended to rescue my people
from this chaotic place,

170
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,901
so I also built an ark.

171
00:08:30,945 --> 00:08:33,643
- Like a big-ass boat?
- A pocket world.

172
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:35,036
A temporary vessel

173
00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:38,169
that pulls every living
Fillorian off the planet

174
00:08:38,213 --> 00:08:42,870
so that I might deliver them
to a new, more perfect world.

175
00:08:42,913 --> 00:08:46,221
- So you're saying we can use
the ark, rescue the people,

176
00:08:46,264 --> 00:08:48,832
blow up Fillory,
and stop the Dark King?

177
00:08:48,876 --> 00:08:51,835
- If anyone is gonna destroy
this putrid stank-hole,

178
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:53,620
it will be me.

179
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:01,758
My gods!

180
00:09:01,802 --> 00:09:03,151
- Guys...

181
00:09:03,194 --> 00:09:05,980
- Then they just slapped
each other over and over

182
00:09:06,023 --> 00:09:07,198
for hours.

183
00:09:07,242 --> 00:09:09,244
- I think they forgot
we were there.

184
00:09:09,287 --> 00:09:11,333
- Okay, I'm just having
a hard time with the part

185
00:09:11,376 --> 00:09:14,031
where we save Fillory
by destroying it.

186
00:09:14,075 --> 00:09:17,557
- Yeah.
It seems extreme.

187
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,775
- And what happens to magic?

188
00:09:18,819 --> 00:09:21,082
I mean, the Wellspring is
on Fillory.

189
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,344
- Well, we don't know.

190
00:09:22,387 --> 00:09:23,693
But our only other choice is

191
00:09:23,737 --> 00:09:26,174
to let the dead spill
into our world.

192
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:27,218
Every world.

193
00:09:27,262 --> 00:09:28,916
- The pocket world
is temporary.

194
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,658
So where do we put
all the Fillorians--Earth?

195
00:09:31,701 --> 00:09:34,138
Have you seen how we treat
our own refugees?

196
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,055
- What about the World Seed?

197
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:40,057
From Q's page.

198
00:09:40,101 --> 00:09:43,713
If we could find it, we could
use it to build a new world...

199
00:09:43,757 --> 00:09:45,019
a new Fillory.

200
00:09:46,673 --> 00:09:49,023
- That's insane...

201
00:09:49,066 --> 00:09:50,372
in a good way.

202
00:09:50,415 --> 00:09:52,635
- And a bad way.

203
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,071
I think The Couple
have the seed.

204
00:09:54,115 --> 00:09:56,944
And the page they stole is
just an instruction manual.

205
00:09:56,987 --> 00:09:58,380
It's useless on its own.

206
00:09:58,423 --> 00:10:01,949
And they went to some pretty
extreme lengths to get it.

207
00:10:01,992 --> 00:10:03,994
Upside is we have time.

208
00:10:04,038 --> 00:10:05,996
And the Moon will keep them
from casting on it.

209
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,869
And it's in a dead language
I couldn't decipher.

210
00:10:08,912 --> 00:10:10,218
I took pictures, but--

211
00:10:10,261 --> 00:10:12,176
- Okay, well, if you work
on finding the seed,

212
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,787
I can work on the language.

213
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,833
- Sticking us with grabbing
the ark thingy from Umber's.

214
00:10:16,877 --> 00:10:19,706
- Quentin and I went once.
It's in Vancouver.

215
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:23,144
Is your traveling still jacked?
- Yeah.

216
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:24,928
But there is someone
who could help.

217
00:10:28,976 --> 00:10:31,282
Okay, buddy.

218
00:10:31,326 --> 00:10:32,893
If you can hear me...

219
00:10:36,157 --> 00:10:37,767
Be the Hyman.

220
00:11:01,835 --> 00:11:04,098
I'm a-alive?

221
00:11:04,141 --> 00:11:06,143
- Yeah.

222
00:11:19,113 --> 00:11:21,158
Thank you.
Thank you.

223
00:11:43,006 --> 00:11:44,268
Whore!

224
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:50,710
Just kidding.

225
00:11:55,584 --> 00:11:59,153
My God.
This is incredible.

226
00:11:59,196 --> 00:12:01,721
I love fingering things.

227
00:12:03,157 --> 00:12:04,506
- Right, okay.

228
00:12:04,549 --> 00:12:06,247
How about a few

229
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,379
"being alive in
the 21st-century" ground rules?

230
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,732
- First of all, you can't act
like a fucking pervert anymore.

231
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:15,343
Even white dudes can't
get away with that shit.

232
00:12:15,386 --> 00:12:16,953
Most of the time.

233
00:12:16,997 --> 00:12:19,303
People can see you
and hear you and--

234
00:12:19,347 --> 00:12:23,307
- And smell you.
Sorry, pregnancy nose.

235
00:12:23,351 --> 00:12:25,135
No.

236
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:27,094
- Ground rules, Hyman.

237
00:12:27,137 --> 00:12:29,705
- Okay, boys, let's get back
on mission, shall we?

238
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,664
We need you to travel
some people to Umber's house.

239
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:33,753
You think you can do it?

240
00:12:33,796 --> 00:12:36,668
- You guys need me?
Whoa.

241
00:12:36,712 --> 00:12:38,148
My traveling's a little rusty,

242
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:40,107
but I'll do
whatever you guys need.

243
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,022
- Yeah, about that...

244
00:12:47,723 --> 00:12:50,160
You wouldn't know it
from how stoic I was,

245
00:12:50,204 --> 00:12:53,685
but it was the worst pain
anyone has ever felt.

246
00:12:53,729 --> 00:12:56,079
- Wow, that's neat.
Here's the address to Umber's.

247
00:12:56,123 --> 00:12:57,689
Are you sure you can do this?

248
00:12:57,733 --> 00:13:01,041
Buddy, I know my onions.
- That means yes?

249
00:13:01,084 --> 00:13:03,565
That must mean yes.

250
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:08,309
- Hey.
- Hi.

251
00:13:08,352 --> 00:13:11,051
- Remind me.
You are...

252
00:13:11,094 --> 00:13:13,575
- Fen.
- Fen.

253
00:13:13,618 --> 00:13:14,750
- Eliot's wife.

254
00:13:16,143 --> 00:13:18,667
- Fillory girl.
- Of course, Fillory girl.

255
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:21,191
You're the--
you're the one who loves forks.

256
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:24,542
What's got you grummy?
- I'm fine.

257
00:13:24,586 --> 00:13:27,632
- As a seasoned viewer
of people,

258
00:13:27,676 --> 00:13:30,548
I think you're upset
'cause their plan is zany,

259
00:13:30,592 --> 00:13:32,507
and you know if you speak up,
they won't listen.

260
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,291
What? No.

261
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:38,730
Their--their plan is great.
And they do listen to me.

262
00:13:38,774 --> 00:13:40,732
- Didn't Eliot say
you were a hayseed

263
00:13:40,776 --> 00:13:44,084
from a backwards
prolapsed asshole of a planet?

264
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:46,521
Or were you not there?

265
00:13:48,305 --> 00:13:51,047
Okay, outsider to outsider...
- Yeah?

266
00:13:51,091 --> 00:13:53,484
- Doesn't this feel like
the part in the story

267
00:13:53,528 --> 00:13:57,271
where the good guys
are just wrong?

268
00:13:57,314 --> 00:13:59,229
Hearts in the right place,
but they haven't learned

269
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:01,579
the lesson of this little
morality play they're in yet.

270
00:14:01,623 --> 00:14:03,407
So they have this crazy plan

271
00:14:03,451 --> 00:14:05,757
that makes them almost
as bad as the villain.

272
00:14:05,801 --> 00:14:08,543
Or maybe it's just me.

273
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:17,117
I did it.

274
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,424
I really did it.

275
00:14:20,468 --> 00:14:22,426
- We'll ring you when
we're ready to travel back.

276
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,863
- I'm not coming
with you inside?

277
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:26,256
- We're all full up
on perverts here.

278
00:14:27,605 --> 00:14:30,086
That's--
that's--that's fine.

279
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:33,437
I've got other stuff to do.
I'm--I'm...

280
00:14:33,481 --> 00:14:35,309
Maybe I'll go Google myself.

281
00:14:35,352 --> 00:14:37,615
- You know what?
Knock--knock yourself out.

282
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:39,095
- That's...

283
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:40,618
- Bye.
- Bye.

284
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:47,234
- I'm sorry.

285
00:14:47,277 --> 00:14:49,366
The master of the house
isn't available right now.

286
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,759
Please return another time.

287
00:14:50,802 --> 00:14:52,804
- Wait, why does he look
like Umber, but boring?

288
00:14:52,848 --> 00:14:55,938
- That's his human form,
for blending in with Canadians.

289
00:14:55,982 --> 00:14:57,635
Must be another emanation.

290
00:14:57,679 --> 00:14:58,941
- He's a ghost butler.

291
00:15:00,334 --> 00:15:02,162
That guy.

292
00:15:02,205 --> 00:15:04,468
- We spoke to the horny version
of you in Fillory.

293
00:15:04,512 --> 00:15:07,254
He sent us here to get a thing.
Can we?

294
00:15:07,297 --> 00:15:09,604
- In the beginning,
there was nothing

295
00:15:09,647 --> 00:15:12,346
until a tigress,
blind in one eye,

296
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:14,696
came to a lonely shore.

297
00:15:14,739 --> 00:15:17,655
The tigress looked upon
this raw world, and...

298
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:20,571
- And...what?

299
00:15:20,615 --> 00:15:22,182
- I'm sorry.

300
00:15:22,225 --> 00:15:23,835
The master of the house
isn't available.

301
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:26,490
- I think ghost butler
is broken.

302
00:15:26,534 --> 00:15:28,449
- Or it's a test.

303
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:30,494
Solve the puzzle,
get in the door.

304
00:15:30,538 --> 00:15:31,495
- How could it be a test?

305
00:15:31,539 --> 00:15:33,976
He's just spouting
random nonsense.

306
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:37,588
- It's not random.
It's Fillorian scripture.

307
00:15:37,632 --> 00:15:38,850
The birth of Ember and Umber.

308
00:15:38,894 --> 00:15:40,852
You guys haven't heard
this story?

309
00:15:40,896 --> 00:15:43,507
- What happens next?

310
00:15:43,551 --> 00:15:46,989
- Well, the tigress--

311
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:50,514
she waded into the ocean
and drowned herself.

312
00:15:50,558 --> 00:15:53,343
And as her body disappeared
beneath the waves,

313
00:15:53,387 --> 00:15:56,564
two shells washed ashore.

314
00:15:56,607 --> 00:15:58,827
And from those shells
came Ember

315
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,612
and then his shadow, Umber.

316
00:16:02,787 --> 00:16:04,876
- Welcome.

317
00:16:18,281 --> 00:16:21,371
God, shut up.

318
00:16:21,415 --> 00:16:22,764
- Julia.

319
00:16:22,807 --> 00:16:25,375
- I'm fine.
I'm just...

320
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:27,812
It's a little bit
of aftershock, that's all.

321
00:16:36,604 --> 00:16:38,084
- Hyman.

322
00:16:38,127 --> 00:16:42,523
- Penny, did you know
they sell pre-sliced bread now?

323
00:16:42,566 --> 00:16:46,309
That's the greatest invention
since--I don't even know what.

324
00:16:46,353 --> 00:16:48,572
- Your parents--
were they magicians?

325
00:16:48,616 --> 00:16:49,834
- No.

326
00:16:49,878 --> 00:16:51,793
Dad was a door-to-door
snake salesman.

327
00:16:51,836 --> 00:16:54,404
- Snake oil?
- No.

328
00:16:54,448 --> 00:16:56,841
And my mom worked
at a brothel.

329
00:16:56,885 --> 00:16:57,973
You know, just mopping.

330
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,411
- Okay, did she, um...

331
00:17:01,455 --> 00:17:04,936
Did she suffer
from any mental problems?

332
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,678
Psychic stuff
from being pregnant with you?

333
00:17:07,722 --> 00:17:10,507
- No.
Nothing like that.

334
00:17:10,551 --> 00:17:13,858
After the lobotomy, she mostly
just sat on the porch

335
00:17:13,902 --> 00:17:16,296
and sucked at bits of hay.

336
00:17:17,645 --> 00:17:20,865
Other than that,
she was the perfect mother.

337
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:21,866
- Okay, come on.

338
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,433
I-I need your help
with something.

339
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:25,348
Put the sandwich down!

340
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:30,005
- You want to find The Couple?

341
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,878
They're a myth like
the Boogeyman or Santa Claus.

342
00:17:33,922 --> 00:17:38,622
Santa is very real,
and so are The Couple.

343
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,755
We met one of them.

344
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:42,452
- The only other person
that I know

345
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:45,629
who believes they're real
is Marina.

346
00:17:45,673 --> 00:17:47,414
- Well, the last time
we saw her,

347
00:17:47,457 --> 00:17:48,980
we screwed her over,
moved the Moon,

348
00:17:49,024 --> 00:17:50,634
stopped
the Harmonic Convergence,

349
00:17:50,678 --> 00:17:51,940
which she was gonna use

350
00:17:51,983 --> 00:17:53,985
for some heist-of-the-century
type of deal.

351
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:56,553
I didn't say
that she'll help you.

352
00:17:56,597 --> 00:17:58,729
I just said she's
the only one who can.

353
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,826
- Pretty by-the-numbers
defensive wards.

354
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:11,873
- Marina's not a by-the-numbers
kind of girl.

355
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:22,492
- You guys.

356
00:18:22,536 --> 00:18:24,886
Come here.

357
00:18:25,974 --> 00:18:30,370
- Kady, I just wanted
to tell you that I am so sorry

358
00:18:30,413 --> 00:18:32,067
for all of the times
that I've hurt you.

359
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,853
Come inside for cookies?

360
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,945
- What the fuck was that?

361
00:18:47,865 --> 00:18:51,434
- I'm still learning
how to bake, so no judging.

362
00:18:51,478 --> 00:18:54,611
Well, go ahead.
They're not poisoned.

363
00:18:54,655 --> 00:18:57,092
- But they might be.

364
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:00,095
- Marina, why are you--
- Nice?

365
00:19:01,227 --> 00:19:03,403
- Well, this might
surprise you...

366
00:19:03,446 --> 00:19:06,754
But I made
some bad choices in the past.

367
00:19:06,797 --> 00:19:10,758
And I needed to fix that,
so I went to a trance healer.

368
00:19:10,801 --> 00:19:12,107
Um...

369
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,109
she put a block on all
the parts of my personality

370
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,415
that made aggressive,

371
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:18,766
but ultimately
self-destructive, choices.

372
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:21,464
- This feels like a scam.

373
00:19:21,508 --> 00:19:24,728
- That's a weird scam.

374
00:19:24,772 --> 00:19:27,122
I'm not asking you
for anything.

375
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:31,996
And you came to me.
Seems like you need something?

376
00:19:34,129 --> 00:19:36,044
- We're looking for The Couple.

377
00:19:40,048 --> 00:19:41,441
- Well, this has been great,

378
00:19:41,484 --> 00:19:43,225
but I actually have
to get ready for church.

379
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:45,140
- But you know who they are.

380
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,489
- I know that going after them

381
00:19:46,533 --> 00:19:49,971
is the very definition
of an "Old Marina" decision.

382
00:19:52,103 --> 00:19:55,106
Look, I want to help you.
I do, really.

383
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,891
If it was anything else--

384
00:19:56,934 --> 00:19:58,936
- But they have
something we need

385
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,983
to stop the end of everything.

386
00:20:02,026 --> 00:20:03,898
- The World Seed.

387
00:20:03,941 --> 00:20:08,163
The most valuable object in
the multiverse, people say...

388
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,993
which is why I wanted
to steal it...

389
00:20:12,036 --> 00:20:14,604
until you stopped
the Harmonic Convergence.

390
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:16,693
- Wait, that was
your heist of the century?

391
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:18,782
- Wait.
So you could help us steal it.

392
00:20:18,826 --> 00:20:19,870
- No.
No, no, no.

393
00:20:19,914 --> 00:20:23,004
I-I don't do things
like that anymore.

394
00:20:23,047 --> 00:20:26,007
Stealing from The Couple...
people will get hurt.

395
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,618
- Way more people will get hurt
if you don't help us.

396
00:20:28,662 --> 00:20:31,534
- Alice, friends don't
make friends grapple

397
00:20:31,578 --> 00:20:33,014
with the Trolley Problem.

398
00:20:33,057 --> 00:20:36,235
- They cut off my fingers.
There's no gray area here.

399
00:20:41,022 --> 00:20:45,287
- They're hiding the seed
inside a hotel called The Nave.

400
00:20:45,331 --> 00:20:46,810
- I've been there.

401
00:20:46,854 --> 00:20:49,857
They only let in Magicians.
Everything about it is secret.

402
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,075
- It has a vault.

403
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:53,904
It's the most secure place
on the planet.

404
00:20:53,948 --> 00:20:55,906
- But you had a plan
to break in.

405
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,038
- I had partners.

406
00:20:57,081 --> 00:20:59,519
We spent months
constructing a map

407
00:20:59,562 --> 00:21:01,608
of every inch of that hotel
and its defenses.

408
00:21:01,651 --> 00:21:02,957
We called it our heist book.

409
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,700
Problem is,
things got really crazy,

410
00:21:06,743 --> 00:21:09,224
and I don't actually know
where the book ended up.

411
00:21:13,576 --> 00:21:15,839
- But I know someone who might.

412
00:21:17,145 --> 00:21:19,843
Hey, buddy.
Been a minute.

413
00:21:19,887 --> 00:21:21,280
Need some ice chips
or something?

414
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:22,890
- Christ, no.
Go away.

415
00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:24,761
- Is that Gavin
from the Library?

416
00:21:24,805 --> 00:21:26,067
- He doesn't--

417
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,764
- I don't work for
the sodding library anymore.

418
00:21:27,808 --> 00:21:29,200
- Yeah.
- What happened to you?

419
00:21:29,244 --> 00:21:30,724
- She didn't tell you?

420
00:21:30,767 --> 00:21:33,683
Marina hired me
and a few other poor bastards

421
00:21:33,727 --> 00:21:35,206
to rob The Couple.

422
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,296
She didn't tell us that
the plan was suicidal

423
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:39,167
without
the Harmonic Convergence.

424
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,038
Marina sent us in anyway.

425
00:21:41,082 --> 00:21:44,303
One guy was killed,
horribly, I might add.

426
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:46,130
I was lucky.

427
00:21:46,174 --> 00:21:48,829
But now I'm stuck here,
a bag of shattered bones,

428
00:21:48,872 --> 00:21:51,092
can't travel,
with fucking Daryl over there

429
00:21:51,135 --> 00:21:53,181
talking my fucking ear off
all day and night.

430
00:21:53,224 --> 00:21:55,879
And so help me
God, if you wake him up,

431
00:21:55,923 --> 00:21:57,664
I will kill all
of your mothers.

432
00:21:57,707 --> 00:21:59,274
- Marina beat you to that one.

433
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,755
- Then why are you
working with her?

434
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:04,235
- Marina, maybe
you should step outside.

435
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:12,113
- We're not fans of Marina
or The Couple,

436
00:22:12,156 --> 00:22:13,636
but we need the World Seed.

437
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,290
So, if you could just give us
the heist book, we can--

438
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,987
- I would sooner shit my cast.

439
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:18,989
- Well, it looks like that's
gonna happen either way,

440
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:20,251
so why not help us?

441
00:22:20,295 --> 00:22:22,123
- Because that would mean
helping Marina.

442
00:22:22,166 --> 00:22:23,864
And if you think
I'm gonna do that,

443
00:22:23,907 --> 00:22:27,346
then you have few 'roos loose
in the top paddock, love.

444
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:31,959
So either find a way to scratch
my ass or get the hell out.

445
00:22:32,002 --> 00:22:34,178
- That's why you did the spell
to make yourself good.

446
00:22:34,222 --> 00:22:35,963
Because you sent them
on a suicide mission.

447
00:22:36,006 --> 00:22:38,269
- I thought maybe
they'd get lucky.

448
00:22:38,313 --> 00:22:41,098
- Well, they really didn't.
- We need that heist book.

449
00:22:41,142 --> 00:22:43,971
How did you convince Gavin
to help you in the first place?

450
00:22:44,014 --> 00:22:46,321
- I had leverage.

451
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,975
- Well, then use it now.

452
00:22:48,018 --> 00:22:50,151
- That would be
deeply unethical.

453
00:22:52,849 --> 00:22:55,243
- I think I'm gonna go
get him a smoothie.

454
00:22:55,286 --> 00:22:57,985
What?

455
00:22:58,028 --> 00:22:59,769
If he won't help us,
we're stuck.

456
00:22:59,813 --> 00:23:01,336
- We can't be stuck.

457
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,338
We need the book.
We need Marina.

458
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,166
- Or...

459
00:23:05,209 --> 00:23:07,124
we need to be Marina.

460
00:23:08,778 --> 00:23:10,214
God.

461
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,783
- Look, we understand.
You don't want to help us.

462
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:17,439
We can't make you, but we can
take down your wards.

463
00:23:17,483 --> 00:23:19,310
- You're a traveler.

464
00:23:19,354 --> 00:23:22,183
Without mental wards,
you'll hear people's thoughts,

465
00:23:22,226 --> 00:23:25,316
all day, all night,
even while they're sleeping.

466
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,014
- If you do that
while the Moon is borked,

467
00:23:27,057 --> 00:23:28,407
my head will be, too.

468
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,409
- I recently had
several fingers amputated

469
00:23:30,452 --> 00:23:31,758
and reattached.

470
00:23:31,801 --> 00:23:33,412
I'd be more concerned
about that if I were you.

471
00:23:35,239 --> 00:23:38,155
I underestimated you,
Book Tart.

472
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:40,201
You're worse than Marina.

473
00:23:40,244 --> 00:23:42,029
- No.

474
00:23:42,072 --> 00:23:43,465
Just desperate.

475
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,908
Bugger you all to hell.
Stop.

476
00:23:51,952 --> 00:23:53,214
- The heist book.

477
00:23:53,257 --> 00:23:55,042
- I can't give it to you
because I don't have it.

478
00:23:55,085 --> 00:23:57,000
- Who does?
- Anna.

479
00:23:57,044 --> 00:23:58,828
She took it after things
went pear-shaped.

480
00:23:58,872 --> 00:24:00,395
- Who is Anna?

481
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,789
- Ask her.

482
00:24:06,096 --> 00:24:09,360
- Well, now we have
a real problem.

483
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:17,499
- Is that Chinese
and ice cream?

484
00:24:17,543 --> 00:24:19,893
- You could smell that?

485
00:24:19,936 --> 00:24:22,069
- I have a new superpower.
So what'd you get?

486
00:24:22,112 --> 00:24:23,679
Well, I-I...

487
00:24:23,723 --> 00:24:28,249
Didn't know what you
were craving, so everything.

488
00:24:28,292 --> 00:24:29,293
Also...

489
00:24:31,818 --> 00:24:34,081
- The Circumstances
Control Panel?

490
00:24:34,124 --> 00:24:35,299
Did you steal that
from the Lab?

491
00:24:35,343 --> 00:24:37,084
- Hyman helped.

492
00:24:37,127 --> 00:24:39,826
We figured if The Couple
is gonna use the World Seed,

493
00:24:39,869 --> 00:24:41,218
they need clean magic.

494
00:24:41,262 --> 00:24:43,917
So, without this,
they are stuck.

495
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,440
Hence, hiding it here.

496
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,442
If it were going
to be here anyway,

497
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,357
I figured Lipson could come by,

498
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,925
do the treatments,
run some scans--

499
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,100
two birds.

500
00:24:53,143 --> 00:24:54,449
- Right, but Lipson said
the baby was fine.

501
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,364
- She said she needed
to do more tests.

502
00:24:56,407 --> 00:24:58,758
She said
it might be dangerous.

503
00:24:58,801 --> 00:25:00,237
- And you said
you'd have my back,

504
00:25:00,281 --> 00:25:01,935
and instead,
you're trapping me here?

505
00:25:01,978 --> 00:25:04,154
She has to reapply the
treatments every couple hours.

506
00:25:04,198 --> 00:25:06,896
- I'm just looking out
for you and the baby.

507
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,332
I mean, somebody has to.

508
00:25:08,376 --> 00:25:10,857
Shit.

509
00:25:12,598 --> 00:25:14,121
Sorry, I'll be quiet.
Go on.

510
00:25:14,164 --> 00:25:17,124
- You can't eavesdrop
on people's shit like that.

511
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:18,212
- But--

512
00:25:18,255 --> 00:25:20,127
- Yeah, Hyman,
you have a body now.

513
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:23,130
You really need
to understand boundaries.

514
00:25:23,173 --> 00:25:25,306
So do you.
- Julia, wait.

515
00:25:28,004 --> 00:25:31,138
Ooh.

516
00:25:31,181 --> 00:25:32,966
- I stumbled
upon this place last time

517
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:34,924
when I was looking
for the bathroom.

518
00:25:34,968 --> 00:25:37,579
This is where he keeps
all of his...

519
00:25:37,623 --> 00:25:39,494
pocket worlds.

520
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,452
What the fuck?

521
00:25:41,496 --> 00:25:43,933
I swear, this place was
full of them last time.

522
00:25:43,977 --> 00:25:45,892
- Well, where the shit
did they go?

523
00:25:45,935 --> 00:25:48,938
"The Chankly Bore."...

524
00:25:48,982 --> 00:25:50,331
I grew up playing
Queen of the Hump

525
00:25:50,374 --> 00:25:51,593
on hills just like this.

526
00:25:51,637 --> 00:25:54,378
- If it isn't the ark,
I don't give a shit.

527
00:25:54,422 --> 00:25:56,990
- Okay...
Ghost butler?

528
00:25:57,033 --> 00:25:58,818
- I don't think
it works like that.

529
00:25:58,861 --> 00:26:02,038
You can't just summon him.
He's not our butler.

530
00:26:02,082 --> 00:26:04,214
Hi.

531
00:26:04,258 --> 00:26:06,477
- Greetings.
How may I assist you?

532
00:26:06,521 --> 00:26:07,914
- We're looking
for a pocket world.

533
00:26:07,957 --> 00:26:09,524
- The master of the house
is not available.

534
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,178
all: We know.

535
00:26:11,221 --> 00:26:13,049
- And so all pocket worlds
have been removed

536
00:26:13,093 --> 00:26:14,355
for security purposes.

537
00:26:14,398 --> 00:26:16,923
- It's okay.
Umber sent us to get it.

538
00:26:16,966 --> 00:26:18,489
He--he told us it'd be here.

539
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:20,361
- Which world did he send you
to retrieve?

540
00:26:20,404 --> 00:26:22,885
- It's called The Ark.

541
00:26:24,452 --> 00:26:25,888
- Very well.

542
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,632
If Umber sent you on this task,

543
00:26:30,676 --> 00:26:33,287
you should be able
to identify the true ark.

544
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:36,856
But if you choose poorly...
- Ooh!

545
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:40,468
We age really fast,
and then we all turn to dust

546
00:26:40,511 --> 00:26:41,991
just like
in "the Last Crusade."

547
00:26:42,035 --> 00:26:43,558
- Indeed.

548
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,647
This security precaution is
inspired by my master's love

549
00:26:45,691 --> 00:26:47,649
for "Indiana Jones
and the Last Crusade."

550
00:26:47,693 --> 00:26:48,824
For copyright purposes,

551
00:26:48,868 --> 00:26:50,870
the consequences
of an incorrect choice

552
00:26:50,913 --> 00:26:54,221
has been changed
to something more explosive.

553
00:26:54,264 --> 00:26:56,136
Choose...
- Wisely.

554
00:26:56,179 --> 00:26:58,138
Yeah, we get it.

555
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:01,663
- All right, Fen.

556
00:27:01,707 --> 00:27:04,144
You're the Fillory expert.
Have at it.

557
00:27:12,239 --> 00:27:13,588
Any day now.

558
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,071
- You know what?

559
00:27:18,114 --> 00:27:20,073
Figure it out yourself.

560
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:29,125
- You need to let me
do the talking.

561
00:27:29,169 --> 00:27:30,126
This is sensitive.

562
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:31,475
How did you fuck
over Anna?

563
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:32,825
She lose a limb or something?

564
00:27:32,868 --> 00:27:34,565
- Well, I definitely
fucked her.

565
00:27:34,609 --> 00:27:36,524
- Wait, she's your--
- Anna.

566
00:27:37,786 --> 00:27:39,614
- Marina.

567
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,355
- I want nothing
to do with you.

568
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:44,924
- Anna, please.
It's an emergency.

569
00:27:48,797 --> 00:27:50,407
It wasn't just one lie.

570
00:27:50,451 --> 00:27:52,975
It was how one led
to another and another.

571
00:27:53,019 --> 00:27:55,978
And now I don't know
if any of it was real.

572
00:27:56,022 --> 00:27:58,851
Did you know that she was
from a different timeline?

573
00:27:58,894 --> 00:28:00,200
'Cause I didn't.

574
00:28:00,243 --> 00:28:02,289
And then you tried
to rob The Couple.

575
00:28:02,332 --> 00:28:04,900
Our friend died because of you.

576
00:28:04,944 --> 00:28:08,469
- I know.
I was a terrible person.

577
00:28:08,512 --> 00:28:11,951
I was a greedy,
self-centered sociopath.

578
00:28:11,994 --> 00:28:14,997
And when you left me,
I deserved it.

579
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:17,391
But I'm making amends now.

580
00:28:17,434 --> 00:28:19,001
I've done a bunch of things
on your list.

581
00:28:19,045 --> 00:28:20,350
I got the trance healing done.

582
00:28:20,394 --> 00:28:23,571
- But yet, here you are,
asking for the heist book.

583
00:28:23,614 --> 00:28:25,834
Wait, no,
that's just for us.

584
00:28:25,878 --> 00:28:27,618
- Or maybe this is
just another lie,

585
00:28:27,662 --> 00:28:31,405
and you aren't better,
y-you aren't different at all.

586
00:28:31,448 --> 00:28:34,756
- Look, trust me.
She is very different.

587
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,627
I mean, she baked us cookies.
- Yeah.

588
00:28:36,671 --> 00:28:38,978
- Really terrible cookies.

589
00:28:39,021 --> 00:28:41,415
- I don't trust you, okay?
You showed up with her.

590
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:43,852
- Just give us the book,
and we'll go.

591
00:28:43,896 --> 00:28:46,594
We'll never pull her into
our life of crime ever again.

592
00:28:46,637 --> 00:28:48,944
Marina doesn't have
to be involved anymore.

593
00:28:52,339 --> 00:28:53,819
- But I do.

594
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:57,474
I'm sorry.
I literally can't lie.

595
00:28:57,518 --> 00:29:01,827
This isn't simple
like robbing a bank.

596
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:04,264
You can't do it without me.

597
00:29:04,307 --> 00:29:05,961
And plus, I promised
I would help you.

598
00:29:06,005 --> 00:29:07,920
- At least you're honest.

599
00:29:14,056 --> 00:29:16,450
- I'm gonna take the spell
off Marina.

600
00:29:16,493 --> 00:29:17,756
- What?

601
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:20,062
- The Healer would have used
a synaptic blocker--

602
00:29:20,106 --> 00:29:22,543
easy to remove,
even under weird circumstances.

603
00:29:22,586 --> 00:29:25,328
- You want to bring back
the bad Marina?

604
00:29:25,372 --> 00:29:26,982
- To get the book, we need her

605
00:29:27,026 --> 00:29:28,984
to tell Anna that she's not
gonna help with the heist.

606
00:29:29,028 --> 00:29:30,812
We need her to lie.

607
00:29:30,856 --> 00:29:33,684
You're the one who said
that we should be like Marina.

608
00:29:33,728 --> 00:29:36,818
This time we need
the real Marina.

609
00:29:36,862 --> 00:29:38,951
Yeah, I think
she needs a minute.

610
00:29:41,475 --> 00:29:44,304
What are you doing?
- Word-as-bond spell.

611
00:29:44,347 --> 00:29:45,653
It's a magically
binding contract

612
00:29:45,696 --> 00:29:47,698
that guarantees that you
will get the book for us

613
00:29:47,742 --> 00:29:50,353
and, when you help us with the
heist, you won't fuck us over.

614
00:29:50,397 --> 00:29:51,833
- Well, you don't need that.

615
00:29:51,877 --> 00:29:53,835
I mean, with the spell
I'm under,

616
00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:56,011
I couldn't betray you
even if I wanted to.

617
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,798
- Better safe than sorry.

618
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:08,067
- Julia?
Are you here?

619
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,682
What are you doing?
- Just stretching.

620
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,817
- You're trying
to put yourself into stasis.

621
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,340
What the hell, man?

622
00:30:20,383 --> 00:30:22,995
- To be honest, I haven't
really enjoyed this episode

623
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:24,387
of my life.

624
00:30:24,431 --> 00:30:26,433
What is so great
about having a body anyway?

625
00:30:26,476 --> 00:30:28,043
Y-you're hungry
all the time.

626
00:30:28,087 --> 00:30:30,350
Everything you do
makes you sore.

627
00:30:30,393 --> 00:30:33,657
You're pooping constantly.

628
00:30:33,701 --> 00:30:36,486
- That hasn't been
my experience,

629
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:40,751
but your body's been in a bench
for a century, man.

630
00:30:40,795 --> 00:30:42,231
Give it a minute.

631
00:30:42,275 --> 00:30:44,930
- And when dramatic things
are happening to your friends,

632
00:30:44,973 --> 00:30:46,627
you can't even watch.

633
00:30:48,194 --> 00:30:50,544
- This is about me and Julia?

634
00:30:50,587 --> 00:30:53,547
You're pissed
because you can't listen in

635
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:57,594
on everyone's
personal conversations?

636
00:30:57,638 --> 00:31:00,380
It's none of your business.
- But it is.

637
00:31:00,423 --> 00:31:01,947
I put you two together.

638
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:05,646
I-I shipped you before
you even shipped yourselves.

639
00:31:05,689 --> 00:31:08,083
Before, I was
a part of everything.

640
00:31:08,127 --> 00:31:12,044
And now I am
a, minor character

641
00:31:12,087 --> 00:31:14,394
in my own story.

642
00:31:14,437 --> 00:31:15,743
God.

643
00:31:20,922 --> 00:31:24,056
- Well, that's...

644
00:31:24,099 --> 00:31:25,666
that's the trade-off.

645
00:31:25,709 --> 00:31:30,540
You don't get to spy
on people's intimate moments.

646
00:31:30,584 --> 00:31:31,715
You get to live your own.

647
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:33,848
- And that's supposed
to be better?

648
00:31:35,545 --> 00:31:38,070
If people wanted to talk to me,

649
00:31:38,113 --> 00:31:40,855
you think I would have
done this in the first place?

650
00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:45,120
- So spying
on the showers was...

651
00:31:45,164 --> 00:31:46,469
- Loneliness.

652
00:31:48,819 --> 00:31:49,951
And horniness.

653
00:31:51,997 --> 00:31:54,913
- You're never gonna make
a connection by hiding, Hyman.

654
00:31:54,956 --> 00:31:56,871
You got to put yourself
out there.

655
00:31:56,915 --> 00:32:00,614
Just be honest with people.

656
00:32:00,657 --> 00:32:03,051
It may take a minute,

657
00:32:03,095 --> 00:32:05,662
but you'll find someone
who can stand you.

658
00:32:07,186 --> 00:32:09,057
Are you doing that thing

659
00:32:09,101 --> 00:32:11,059
where you're giving me advice
but it's just for you?

660
00:32:11,103 --> 00:32:13,105
- No, I'm trying to--

661
00:32:15,194 --> 00:32:18,458
God damn it.

662
00:32:18,501 --> 00:32:20,025
I got to find Julia.

663
00:32:21,896 --> 00:32:23,593
While I'm gone,

664
00:32:23,637 --> 00:32:25,682
promise me you're
not gonna stasis yourself.

665
00:32:25,726 --> 00:32:28,816
Well...

666
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:30,470
- Give me the locket.

667
00:32:34,691 --> 00:32:38,130
Talk to somebody.
Have a conversation.

668
00:32:56,713 --> 00:32:59,194
- Hello?
Is someone there?

669
00:33:03,677 --> 00:33:07,289
Miss Wicker.

670
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:11,728
I have been looking for you.

671
00:33:11,772 --> 00:33:14,166
Yes, it's come to this.

672
00:33:20,085 --> 00:33:23,349
- Sir Effingham, what are you
doing with that trash can?

673
00:33:23,392 --> 00:33:25,133
- Some hapless fellow

674
00:33:25,177 --> 00:33:28,006
left a sandwich of roast beef
in there,

675
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:29,877
and as I could not
get to market today--

676
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,358
My heavens.

677
00:33:32,401 --> 00:33:35,709
You have embraced
the blessing of your sex.

678
00:33:35,752 --> 00:33:39,800
But surely you have misplaced
your wedding band?

679
00:33:39,843 --> 00:33:41,889
You are widowed, then?
- No.

680
00:33:41,932 --> 00:33:45,066
- You poor dear.
You are carrying a bastard.

681
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,285
- Definitely talking to one.

682
00:33:46,328 --> 00:33:48,852
Look, I thought you chose Todd
for this quest.

683
00:33:48,896 --> 00:33:52,378
- I fear he is not the intrepid
hero I once thought him to be.

684
00:33:52,421 --> 00:33:53,901
- You don't say.

685
00:33:53,944 --> 00:33:57,383
- Which is why,
in my gravest hour of need,

686
00:33:57,426 --> 00:34:01,082
I have come
to vouchsafe you a quest.

687
00:34:01,126 --> 00:34:02,866
- Look, if this has
to do with Fillory--

688
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:06,261
- For my vision of Fillory's
demise has grown clearer.

689
00:34:06,305 --> 00:34:09,482
I now see those who would bring
the apocalypse to Fillory

690
00:34:09,525 --> 00:34:12,050
have visited many times before.

691
00:34:12,093 --> 00:34:15,923
They enter from a distant realm
through a tree.

692
00:34:15,966 --> 00:34:18,273
- Like a portal tree?
- Indeed.

693
00:34:18,317 --> 00:34:22,060
These fiends plan to thieve
away every soul in the land

694
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:24,279
before they
destroy it outright.

695
00:34:27,326 --> 00:34:29,850
How exactly do they do that?

696
00:34:29,893 --> 00:34:32,940
- My vision is hazy,
but I do know

697
00:34:32,983 --> 00:34:35,769
that they will turn back
the clock on Fillory,

698
00:34:35,812 --> 00:34:37,771
resulting in ruin.

699
00:34:37,814 --> 00:34:39,860
- Um...

700
00:34:39,903 --> 00:34:41,427
do these fiends--do they--

701
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:43,864
do they succeed
in stealing the people

702
00:34:43,907 --> 00:34:45,344
and building a new world
for them?

703
00:34:45,387 --> 00:34:46,954
- That much I do
not know because--

704
00:34:46,997 --> 00:34:48,999
Wait.

705
00:34:49,043 --> 00:34:51,828
I made no mention
of a new world.

706
00:34:53,047 --> 00:34:55,789
It is you.
- It's for Fillory's own good.

707
00:34:55,832 --> 00:34:57,051
The dead will rise.

708
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,009
This is the only way
that we can save everyone.

709
00:34:59,053 --> 00:35:00,402
Hogwash!

710
00:35:00,446 --> 00:35:03,840
What dark forces have
corrupted your fair mind?

711
00:35:03,884 --> 00:35:05,015
- You have.

712
00:35:05,059 --> 00:35:06,321
We wouldn't be on this quest

713
00:35:06,365 --> 00:35:08,193
if you hadn't told me about it
in the first place.

714
00:35:08,236 --> 00:35:10,978
- Are you now blaming me
for your own villainy?

715
00:35:11,021 --> 00:35:13,328
The ways of the sow

716
00:35:13,372 --> 00:35:16,157
are nastier
than I thought possible.

717
00:35:16,201 --> 00:35:18,072
But--but know this.

718
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:21,423
The death of Fillory
cannot come without a cost.

719
00:35:21,467 --> 00:35:23,556
- What do you mean?

720
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:28,300
- Those who would destroy her
will lose the ones they love.

721
00:35:43,663 --> 00:35:46,231
- So we're sorry
for treating you

722
00:35:46,274 --> 00:35:50,191
like the friend who only
gets invited to trivia night.

723
00:35:50,235 --> 00:35:53,281
- You know I don't know
what that means.

724
00:35:53,325 --> 00:35:54,413
- Yeah.

725
00:35:58,417 --> 00:36:00,593
Will you please help us
choose a globe?

726
00:36:00,636 --> 00:36:02,072
Margo is chomping at the bit,

727
00:36:02,116 --> 00:36:05,032
and Josh is holding her off
for as long as he can.

728
00:36:05,075 --> 00:36:08,209
- I thought I could talk myself
into this.

729
00:36:08,253 --> 00:36:11,081
But I just keep thinking,
if this was Earth,

730
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:15,347
you would try a lot harder
to find some other way.

731
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:17,958
- Yeah, probably.

732
00:36:18,001 --> 00:36:20,613
- So maybe it's my job
to represent Fillory.

733
00:36:20,656 --> 00:36:24,051
But not just the people,
the place...

734
00:36:24,094 --> 00:36:25,531
the history,

735
00:36:25,574 --> 00:36:29,230
the things we can't take
with us.

736
00:36:29,274 --> 00:36:32,625
You want my permission
to destroy it.

737
00:36:34,279 --> 00:36:36,281
I can't give that to you.

738
00:36:36,324 --> 00:36:40,110
- Well, if you have any
other ideas, we are all ears.

739
00:36:40,154 --> 00:36:43,201
Do you?
- No.

740
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,167
- Was that supposed to do that?

741
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,475
- Fillorians write down their
prayers to Umber and burn them.

742
00:36:56,518 --> 00:36:58,651
This must be
where they show up.

743
00:36:58,694 --> 00:37:00,653
- So they still pray to him
even though he's dead?

744
00:37:00,696 --> 00:37:03,351
- I know what you're thinking.

745
00:37:03,395 --> 00:37:05,092
It's just like
the people of Fillory

746
00:37:05,135 --> 00:37:06,572
to do something so stupid.

747
00:37:06,615 --> 00:37:09,966
- No.
I was thinking...

748
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:14,493
it's taken me a really
long time to, figure out

749
00:37:14,536 --> 00:37:18,714
that you can still love
something even after it's gone.

750
00:37:18,758 --> 00:37:21,500
- Even if you helped kill it?

751
00:37:24,459 --> 00:37:25,591
Okay, Fen.

752
00:37:25,634 --> 00:37:29,377
It's time
for a "come to Umber" talk.

753
00:37:29,421 --> 00:37:31,510
You don't want
to be a sidekick?

754
00:37:31,553 --> 00:37:35,165
You want to have a say?
This is what that feels like.

755
00:37:35,209 --> 00:37:37,298
I'm not asking
for your permission.

756
00:37:37,342 --> 00:37:38,647
Some part of Fillory
has to die,

757
00:37:38,691 --> 00:37:40,736
and you're the one
who has to choose.

758
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:43,130
Is it gonna be
the rocks and the dirt?

759
00:37:43,173 --> 00:37:45,524
Or is it gonna be the people
and the traditions

760
00:37:45,567 --> 00:37:49,310
and all of the things
that you can take with you?

761
00:37:49,354 --> 00:37:50,616
- I got it!

762
00:37:50,659 --> 00:37:51,617
No.

763
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,228
- Aw, shit.
I don't got it.

764
00:37:56,361 --> 00:37:57,318
Aah!

765
00:38:15,031 --> 00:38:17,730
It--it didn't explode.
I-I did it.

766
00:38:17,773 --> 00:38:21,081
I chose wisely.
I'm wise.

767
00:38:21,124 --> 00:38:23,997
- All the people of Fillory...

768
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,652
are going to fit
into a seahorse?

769
00:38:27,827 --> 00:38:29,785
- How do you know
that was the one?

770
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:31,613
- Because that's
how Ember and Umber

771
00:38:31,657 --> 00:38:33,485
first brought people
to Fillory.

772
00:38:33,528 --> 00:38:35,182
They chartered
the Great Seahorse

773
00:38:35,225 --> 00:38:36,575
to carry us in his pouch.

774
00:38:39,186 --> 00:38:42,494
- What?
How did people get to Earth?

775
00:38:42,537 --> 00:38:44,191
- The same.
- Well--

776
00:38:44,234 --> 00:38:45,279
The same.

777
00:38:46,846 --> 00:38:49,065
- And I promise
I won't have anything to do

778
00:38:49,109 --> 00:38:50,197
with robbing The Couple.

779
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,199
If you give the book
to Kady and Alice,

780
00:38:52,242 --> 00:38:54,767
I'll never see it again.

781
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:57,378
- Watching evil Marina
pretend to be good is...

782
00:38:58,814 --> 00:39:00,729
I feel like shit.

783
00:39:00,773 --> 00:39:03,428
Yeah, I feel like shit, too.

784
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,307
- Here.
I'm glad to be rid of it.

785
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:15,396
- Is that--
- The heist book?

786
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,790
I know
It doesn't look like much.

787
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:21,054
- Thank you.
You guys...

788
00:39:21,097 --> 00:39:24,884
- We have a lot of work
to do...on us.

789
00:39:24,927 --> 00:39:27,887
But we're gonna try
now that I'm better.

790
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:30,368
- Good.

791
00:39:30,411 --> 00:39:32,805
Okay, so I guess
we're done here.

792
00:39:32,848 --> 00:39:36,417
And we won't
bother you anymore.

793
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:38,245
- Yeah.

794
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:46,122
- Hey.
I've been looking for you.

795
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:48,821
- I saw the Pig Man again.

796
00:39:50,257 --> 00:39:52,041
Turns out,
you know that apocalypse

797
00:39:52,085 --> 00:39:54,130
I've been trying to stop?

798
00:39:54,174 --> 00:39:55,436
we cause it.

799
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,265
- If the prophecy says
that Fillory is destroyed,

800
00:39:58,308 --> 00:40:00,093
that means we succeed, right?

801
00:40:00,136 --> 00:40:02,443
I mean...

802
00:40:02,487 --> 00:40:03,531
good news?

803
00:40:03,575 --> 00:40:07,187
- Yeah.
Good news.

804
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:09,276
- Look, about earlier,
I need to tell you--

805
00:40:09,319 --> 00:40:11,147
- Look, I know.
I was irresponsible.

806
00:40:11,191 --> 00:40:13,193
Look, I should just
accept the fact

807
00:40:13,236 --> 00:40:16,762
that any control I had
over my life is now gone

808
00:40:16,805 --> 00:40:18,894
and I am a walking incubator.

809
00:40:18,938 --> 00:40:19,982
- Julia--

810
00:40:20,026 --> 00:40:21,288
- It's just terrifying,
you know?

811
00:40:21,331 --> 00:40:24,334
What if Lipson does the test
and it's bad news?

812
00:40:24,378 --> 00:40:26,293
You know, right now
everything is good.

813
00:40:26,336 --> 00:40:28,338
And the thought of losing
any of that is just--

814
00:40:28,382 --> 00:40:33,126
- Julia, it's not the baby
I'm freaking out about.

815
00:40:33,169 --> 00:40:35,302
Look, I told you
about how my dad left,

816
00:40:35,345 --> 00:40:40,133
but what I didn't tell you...

817
00:40:40,176 --> 00:40:43,310
what I haven't told
anyone is...

818
00:40:43,353 --> 00:40:46,313
around that time,
my mom...

819
00:40:46,356 --> 00:40:48,358
started having episodes.

820
00:40:51,361 --> 00:40:54,321
Getting disoriented,
hearing shit that wasn't there.

821
00:40:54,364 --> 00:40:56,410
Um...

822
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,368
the doctors thought
it was just stress

823
00:40:58,412 --> 00:41:00,240
from my dad bailing
on us, but--

824
00:41:00,283 --> 00:41:02,329
- You think it's
because of you.

825
00:41:06,551 --> 00:41:10,163
- What's happening to you...

826
00:41:10,206 --> 00:41:13,122
looks just like
what happened to my mom.

827
00:41:15,037 --> 00:41:17,518
And the episodes didn't stop
when I was born.

828
00:41:17,562 --> 00:41:18,998
They got worse.

829
00:41:22,044 --> 00:41:25,134
When she burned down
our apartment,

830
00:41:25,178 --> 00:41:28,355
it was the first time
I got thrown into foster care.

831
00:41:28,398 --> 00:41:32,925
She'd fight to get me back,
and then she'd get sick again.

832
00:41:35,318 --> 00:41:39,279
Eventually the state
took me in for good.

833
00:41:39,322 --> 00:41:41,455
And I was scared, but...

834
00:41:43,675 --> 00:41:46,504
I was more scared of my mom.

835
00:41:48,549 --> 00:41:50,856
I fucked her up for life.

836
00:41:54,468 --> 00:41:55,817
- I'm so sorry.

837
00:41:55,861 --> 00:41:59,386
- I don't want what happened
to her to happen to you.

838
00:41:59,429 --> 00:42:01,606
- Okay.
I get it.

839
00:42:03,259 --> 00:42:06,132
I'll do it...

840
00:42:06,175 --> 00:42:07,568
the scans, the treatments.

841
00:42:07,612 --> 00:42:09,396
But you have to know
it won't be

842
00:42:09,439 --> 00:42:11,006
like what happened
to your mom.

843
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:13,400
We know about magic.

844
00:42:13,443 --> 00:42:15,924
We have ways to deal with it.

845
00:42:17,447 --> 00:42:19,406
- And I won't put you
in a cage.

846
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:30,983
What the hell, man?

847
00:42:31,026 --> 00:42:34,377
- I tried to talk to him,
and he punched me in the face.

848
00:42:34,421 --> 00:42:36,249
- Who?

849
00:42:36,292 --> 00:42:37,467
No.

850
00:42:40,035 --> 00:42:44,170
- I warned you not to cross me.
- How the hell did you get out?

851
00:42:44,213 --> 00:42:47,434
- Let this be my last lesson
to you as dean.

852
00:42:47,477 --> 00:42:51,220
Don't make too many enemies.
They might find each other.

853
00:42:51,264 --> 00:42:53,092
- The Couple.

854
00:42:55,224 --> 00:42:59,228
I can't let you take
that panel out of here.

855
00:42:59,272 --> 00:43:00,708
This is some
"fate of the world" shit.

856
00:43:00,752 --> 00:43:04,016
- Not my world,
not my problem.

857
00:43:04,059 --> 00:43:06,018
- Then I guess
I'm your problem.

858
00:43:07,236 --> 00:43:09,543
- Dean Fogg?
What's going on?

859
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:10,718
- Ha!

860
00:43:10,762 --> 00:43:14,635
This just got
very, very interesting.

861
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:17,246
Are you stupid enough
to try and stop me?

862
00:43:34,176 --> 00:43:36,004
- What just happened?

863
00:43:36,048 --> 00:43:38,137
- The Couple just got
the last thing they need.

864
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:40,748
They have the Seed,
the page, and the Panel.

865
00:43:40,792 --> 00:43:41,967
We got to tell the others.

866
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:44,012
They need to steal
that Seed now.
