1
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,899
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,469
The Couple has power.
And they are not good people.

3
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:11,620
Give me the page.

4
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,499
If the finger's still
viable, I reattach.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,889
I'm Hyman Cooper.

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,889
I was a student here in
the 1920s... a traveler.

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,479
Someone moved my body.

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,605
I stole this.

9
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:25,316
Stasis charm... freezes
the wearer in time.

10
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:27,469
Holy shit. Umber?

11
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:30,196
You make for an excellent
focus group for my new world.

12
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:32,074
More of a pocket world, really.

13
00:00:32,075 --> 00:00:33,879
I will get out of here.

14
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,787
And then I'll turn you
into lobsters and eat you.

15
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,080
Hey, what happened to your eye?

16
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:40,290
I lent it to Josh.

17
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:41,799
Your own personal Margo-Pro.

18
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,001
Josh didn't die.

19
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:46,337
- He was in the Taker Realm and...
- That's not possible.

20
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:49,173
Somebody opened a door that
should not have been opened.

21
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,883
It could mean the end of everything.

22
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,510
I think I can't do what I need to do

23
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,679
if I'm worried about how
it's gonna affect you.

24
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,847
I think we need to be done.

25
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:58,141
My pregnancy is going to be sped up?

26
00:00:58,142 --> 00:00:59,309
It's Red Monkey Month.

27
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,559
Everything goes faster
in Red Monkey Month.

28
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,069
Wait, so you're saying that's a thing...

29
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,179
me being able to take on
what the baby can do?

30
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,189
Maybe.

31
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,527
Well, maybe this baby's a traveler.

32
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:14,283
Yeah, uh... we should probably talk.

33
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,779
It seems like I missed a lot here.

34
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,379
It's actually super simple.

35
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,549
The Dark King, aka Rupert Chatwin,

36
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,795
is trying to jailbreak his dead
lover out of hell or whatever,

37
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,949
so he needs to get rid
of the guard dogs first.

38
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:33,209
Hence, using you as a
human smallpox blanket

39
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,589
to kill the Takers.

40
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:37,930
Yeah, I-I meant more like, uh...

41
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,518
Contraception wards are
supposed to be foolproof.

42
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,599
Don't worry. My uterus is on lock.

43
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,879
Right, 'cause a werewolf
baby could be...

44
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,309
Yikes.

45
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:51,689
But potentially very cute.

46
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,572
Fucking adorable.

47
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,660
Some day. Not now.

48
00:01:58,661 --> 00:02:00,639
I'm not giving birth to
a goddamn litter, Josh.

49
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,100
Besides...

50
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,620
I thought we were done.

51
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,590
You risked your sanity to
save me from the Taker Realm.

52
00:02:12,675 --> 00:02:14,843
If that doesn't buy us
a clean slate, then...

53
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,800
So can we skip to the reunion banging?

54
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,979
- You're wearing three rubbers.
- At least.

55
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,404
Have you been to a doctor?

56
00:02:36,405 --> 00:02:40,035
I mean, they don't exactly
have ultrasounds in Fillory.

57
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,990
Have you thought about
what this means for us?

58
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,869
What do you want it to mean?

59
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,249
We broke up for good reasons.

60
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,870
None of that has changed.

61
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,340
My dad wasn't around for long.

62
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,389
My mom...

63
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,350
Look, I'm not doing that to our kid.

64
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,600
I want to be there for him... her?

65
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,397
No clue yet.

66
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,233
I want you to be there, too.

67
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:13,469
You guys.

68
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,029
Um, I'm sorry, but, um,
there's a problem.

69
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,909
We were in the elevator, and
Eliot and Fen just collapsed.

70
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,940
Hello?

71
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,680
Hello?

72
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,680
Anyone?

73
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,399
Eliot?

74
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,959
Oh, it's you.

75
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,889
What kind of Fillorian nonsense is this?

76
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,899
- Or am I dreaming?
- I know I'm not.

77
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,192
In my dreams, you're nice to me.

78
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:57,999
What the shit is going on?

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,259
Whoa, oh. Look away, look away.

80
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,980
Still draping here.

81
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:05,909
We were just settling on safe
words when we woke up here.

82
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,209
- Any idea why?
- Mm.

83
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:11,369
♪ Yoo-hoo ♪

84
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,050
Welcome, High Kings.

85
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:25,399
Ember. I thought you were dead.

86
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,719
Oh, I am an energetic emanation,

87
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,309
my dear blinking idiot.

88
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,199
A message left by the great god Ember

89
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,349
to forewarn of impending apocalypse.

90
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,619
- I've met this guy before.
- Mm-hmm.

91
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,999
I have brought you here because you are

92
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,531
the living Former High Kings of Fillory,

93
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:44,899
and your kingdom rests
on the knife's edge

94
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,619
of annihilation.

95
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,001
Huh.

96
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:03,910

97
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,186
You do realize I have
other things to do?

98
00:05:11,187 --> 00:05:12,539
Whatever.

99
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:14,659
I just had to pull Josh's pants back on,

100
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,099
- so diagnose.
- They're asleep.

101
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,942
I mean, obviously, they're cursed

102
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,699
or whatever. But beyond that,

103
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,196
just wait and see if they wake up.

104
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,539
Should we just slap them?

105
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,283
Believe me, I tried.

106
00:05:25,284 --> 00:05:27,703
I'm gonna go see what we
have on narcolepsy spells.

107
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,949
You were not pregnant
the last time I saw you,

108
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,469
like, at all.

109
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:37,713
Oh, yeah. Well, things happened fast.

110
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,699
Everything looks fine for now,

111
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,924
but I should do more scans.

112
00:05:44,925 --> 00:05:46,679
It looks like you have fast-forwarded

113
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,439
through the first two trimesters.

114
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,723
You're ready to pop.
Accelerated pregnancies

115
00:05:50,724 --> 00:05:51,739
can be dangerous.

116
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,849
And, uh, it's a hybrid.

117
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,564
Have you had any side effects?
Psychic episodes?

118
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:59,259
Uh, yes, that I kind of caused myself.

119
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:02,320
Yeah, she had to to get
out of, well, a dungeon.

120
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:03,779
But none since.

121
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,649
Um, actually, that's not entirely true.

122
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,579
- Wait, what?
- A couple of aftershocks,

123
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,779
but it's really no big deal.

124
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,719
I've already put up every
mental ward I know.

125
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,914
Okay.

126
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:16,375
There are treatments, but they
have to be applied regularly.

127
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,794
And the only place that it's
safe to cast right now is...

128
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,921
The Brakebills Lab...

129
00:06:19,922 --> 00:06:22,079
because the Moon is still pissed at us.

130
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,619
Uh, look, I'll be there
the minute I can.

131
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,426
We're just dealing with some stuff.

132
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:28,721
Clearly. Don't wait too long.

133
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,499
As you ought to remember,

134
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,140
I am activated by world war,

135
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,772
pandemic, revolt of dwarves...

136
00:06:37,773 --> 00:06:39,299
Or the mass rising of the dead.

137
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,520
Yeah, we know. We're already on it.

138
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,694
Huzzah! And I have summoned all of you

139
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:47,819
because the current ruler is the
nitwit causing the problem.

140
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,993
The thing is he's sort of unkillable.

141
00:06:49,994 --> 00:06:52,279
I rescind my huzzah.

142
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,419
In addition to being just very creepy,

143
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,625
the dead drain life,

144
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,543
contaminating everything they touch,

145
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,959
like a pickle on a sandwich.

146
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,965
- I like pickles.
- Behold!

147
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:07,339
A dead person wriggling
from their grave.

148
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:15,142
And this is every Fillorian
who has ever lived.

149
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:18,396
You see?

150
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:20,895
The pickles of the dead
will ruin Fillory.

151
00:07:20,896 --> 00:07:23,399
You must stop this, whatever the cost.

152
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,320
Well, the cost is blowing
up the entire planet,

153
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,489
- which is...
- A decent option?

154
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,219
I was gonna say counterproductive.

155
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,979
Only if you care about
peasants, which I do not.

156
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:38,089
- Do you want to get that, or...
- Oh, no.

157
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,249
That's just...

158
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,877
A mouse farted or something.

159
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,580
A very gassy mouse.

160
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,679
Umber.

161
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,389
It is I,

162
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:56,820
an energetic emanation of
Umber, great god of...

163
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:59,109
Piss off. Nobody wants you here.

164
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:01,359
I have heard your lamentations

165
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,232
and am here to help.

166
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:06,736
I was designed to intervene
if my anarchist brother

167
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:10,359
tries something stupid,
like blowing up the planet.

168
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,599
Do you have a better suggestion?

169
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,789
I do, sweet matron of Fillory.

170
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,989
After I faked my own death,

171
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,667
I fled to Earth and built new worlds.

172
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:24,309
- Didn't finish any.
- Did too.

173
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,337
Mostly.

174
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,632
I intended to rescue my people
from this chaotic place,

175
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,968
so I also built an ark.

176
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:33,804
- Like a big-ass boat?
- A pocket world.

177
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:35,264
A temporary vessel

178
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:38,679
that pulls every living
Fillorian off the planet

179
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,959
so that I might deliver them
to a new, more perfect world.

180
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,469
So you're saying we can use
the ark, rescue the people,

181
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:49,119
blow up Fillory, and stop the Dark King?

182
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,029
If anyone is gonna destroy
this putrid stank-hole,

183
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,741
it will be me.

184
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,702
Oh!

185
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,909
Oh, my gods!

186
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,539
Guys...

187
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,159
Then they just slapped
each other over and over

188
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,254
for hours.

189
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,341
I think they forgot we were there.

190
00:09:09,342 --> 00:09:11,659
Okay, I'm just having a
hard time with the part

191
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,219
where we save Fillory by destroying it.

192
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,640
Yeah. It seems extreme.

193
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:19,350
And what happens to magic?

194
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:21,185
I mean, the Wellspring is on Fillory.

195
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:22,529
Well, we don't know.

196
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:23,799
But our only other choice is

197
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,389
to let the dead spill into our world.

198
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:27,539
Every world.

199
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,111
The pocket world is temporary.

200
00:09:29,112 --> 00:09:31,719
So where do we put all
the Fillorians... Earth?

201
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,698
Have you seen how we
treat our own refugees?

202
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,449
What about the World Seed?

203
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,239
From Q's page.

204
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,799
If we could find it, we could
use it to build a new world...

205
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,127
a new Fillory.

206
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,209
That's insane...

207
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,629
in a good way.

208
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,379
And a bad way.

209
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,176
I think The Couple have the seed.

210
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:57,139
And the page they stole is
just an instruction manual.

211
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,499
It's useless on its own.

212
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,017
And they went to some pretty
extreme lengths to get it.

213
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,199
Upside is we have time.

214
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,938
And the Moon will keep
them from casting on it.

215
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:09,024
And it's in a dead language
I couldn't decipher.

216
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,409
I took pictures, but...

217
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,486
Okay, well, if you work
on finding the seed,

218
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:13,946
I can work on the language.

219
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:17,059
Sticking us with grabbing the
ark thingy from Umber's.

220
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,819
Oh, Quentin and I went
once. It's in Vancouver.

221
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:23,349
- Is your traveling still jacked?
- Yeah.

222
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,124
But there is someone who could help.

223
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,459
Okay, buddy.

224
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,160
If you can hear me...

225
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,030
Be the Hyman.

226
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,289
I'm a-alive?

227
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:06,329
Yeah.

228
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,379
Thank you. Thank you.

229
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:44,409
Whore!

230
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,199
Oh.

231
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,290
Ugh.

232
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,168
Just kidding.

233
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:59,439
Oh, my God. Ah, this is incredible.

234
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,888
I love fingering things.

235
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,659
Right, okay.

236
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,389
How about a few

237
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,639
"being alive in the
21st-century" ground rules?

238
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,179
- Mm.
- First of all,

239
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,990
you can't act like a
fucking pervert anymore.

240
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,520
Even white dudes can't
get away with that shit.

241
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:17,109
Most of the time.

242
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:19,489
People can see you and hear you and...

243
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,989
And smell you. Sorry, pregnancy nose.

244
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:25,219
- No.
- Ow.

245
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:27,249
Ground rules, Hyman.

246
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,979
Okay, boys, let's get back
on mission, shall we?

247
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,876
Uh, we need you to travel
some people to Umber's house.

248
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:33,939
You think you can do it?

249
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,880
You guys need me? Whoa.

250
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,279
My traveling's a little rusty,

251
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,092
but I'll do whatever you guys need.

252
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,129
Yeah, about that...

253
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,269
You wouldn't know it
from how stoic I was,

254
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,959
but it was the worst pain
anyone has ever felt.

255
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,239
Wow, that's neat. Here's
the address to Umber's.

256
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,999
Are you sure you can do this?

257
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,155
- Buddy, I know my onions.
- That means yes?

258
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:03,658
That must mean yes.

259
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,489
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

260
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:11,119
Remind me. You are...

261
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,792
- Fen.
- Fen.

262
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:14,919
Eliot's wife.

263
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,829
- Fillory girl.
- Oh, of course, Fillory girl.

264
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,217
You're the... you're the
one who loves forks.

265
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:24,709
- What's got you grummy?
- I'm fine.

266
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:27,769
As a seasoned viewer of people,

267
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:30,839
I think you're upset
'cause their plan is zany,

268
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,679
and you know if you speak
up, they won't listen.

269
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,479
What? No.

270
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,939
Their... their plan is great.
And they do listen to me.

271
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,019
Didn't Eliot say you were a hayseed

272
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,479
from a backwards prolapsed
asshole of a planet?

273
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,618
Or were you not there?

274
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,079
- Okay, outsider to outsider...
- Yeah?

275
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,669
Doesn't this feel like
the part in the story

276
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,829
where the good guys are just wrong?

277
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:59,254
Hearts in the right place,
but they haven't learned

278
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,799
the lesson of this little
morality play they're in yet.

279
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,550
So they have this crazy plan

280
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:06,011
that makes them almost
as bad as the villain.

281
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,719
- Oh.
- Or maybe it's just me.

282
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,897
I did it.

283
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,609
I really did it.

284
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,529
We'll ring you when we're
ready to travel back.

285
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,119
I'm not coming with you inside?

286
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,198
We're all full up on perverts here.

287
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:27,616
Oh.

288
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:30,202
Oh, that's... that's... that's fine.

289
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:33,609
I've got other stuff
to do. I'm... I'm...

290
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:35,749
Maybe I'll go Google myself.

291
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,879
You know what? Knock...
knock yourself out.

292
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,309
That's...

293
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:40,713
- Bye.
- Bye.

294
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,219
I'm sorry.

295
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,559
The master of the house
isn't available right now.

296
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,039
Please return another time.

297
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,225
Wait, why does he look
like Umber, but boring?

298
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,811
That's his human form, for
blending in with Canadians.

299
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,799
Must be another emanation.

300
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,189
He's a ghost butler.

301
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,579
♪ Who you gonna call? ♪

302
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,339
That guy.

303
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,639
We spoke to the horny
version of you in Fillory.

304
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:06,114
He sent us here to get a thing.

305
00:15:06,115 --> 00:15:07,439
Can we?

306
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,616
In the beginning, there was nothing

307
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:12,327
until a tigress, blind in one eye,

308
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,879
came to a lonely shore.

309
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,849
The tigress looked upon
this raw world, and...

310
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,749
And... what?

311
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,299
I'm sorry.

312
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,964
The master of the house isn't available.

313
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:26,659
I think ghost butler is broken.

314
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,520
Or it's a test.

315
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:30,637
Solve the puzzle, get in the door.

316
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:31,639
How could it be a test?

317
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:34,129
He's just spouting random nonsense.

318
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:37,739
Oh, it's not random.
It's Fillorian scripture.

319
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,999
The birth of Ember and Umber.

320
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,064
You guys haven't heard this story?

321
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,650
What happens next?

322
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:47,149
Well, the tigress...

323
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:50,659
she waded into the ocean
and drowned herself.

324
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,489
And as her body disappeared
beneath the waves,

325
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,949
two shells washed ashore.

326
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:59,079
And from those shells came Ember

327
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,711
and then his shadow, Umber.

328
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,859
Welcome.

329
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,924
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

330
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:18,319
Ow.

331
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,640
God, shut up.

332
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,981
Julia.

333
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,519
I'm fine. I'm just...

334
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,050
It's a little bit of
aftershock, that's all.

335
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,159
Hyman.

336
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,119
Penny, did you know they
sell pre-sliced bread now?

337
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,129
That's the greatest invention
since... I don't even know what.

338
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,739
Your parents... were they magicians?

339
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:52,009
No. Uh, Dad was a
door-to-door snake salesman.

340
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,379
Snake oil?

341
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,549
No.

342
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:57,057
And my mom worked at a brothel.

343
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:58,226
You know, just mopping.

344
00:16:58,227 --> 00:17:01,439
Okay, did she, um...

345
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,559
Did she suffer from any mental problems?

346
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,859
Psychic stuff from being
pregnant with you?

347
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,729
Oh, no. Nothing like that.

348
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:14,119
After the lobotomy,
she mostly just sat on the porch

349
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,540
and sucked at bits of hay.

350
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:21,009
Other than that,
she was the perfect mother.

351
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,042
Okay, come on. I-I need
your help with something.

352
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:25,200
Put the sandwich down!

353
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,250
You want to find The Couple?

354
00:17:30,258 --> 00:17:34,089
They're a myth like the
Boogeyman or Santa Claus.

355
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:37,919
Ah, Santa is very real,
and so are The Couple.

356
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,929
We met one of them.

357
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,419
The only other person that I know

358
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:45,799
who believes they're real is Marina.

359
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,524
Well, the last time we saw her,

360
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:49,319
we screwed her over, moved the Moon,

361
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,599
stopped the Harmonic Convergence,

362
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,619
which she was gonna use

363
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,239
for some heist-of-the-century
type of deal.

364
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,709
Oh, I didn't say that she'll help you.

365
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,911
I just said she's the only one who can.

366
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,779
Pretty by-the-numbers defensive wards.

367
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,966
Marina's not a
by-the-numbers kind of girl.

368
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,601
You guys.

369
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,021
- Come here.
- Uh, uh...

370
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,469
Kady, I just wanted to tell
you that I am so sorry

371
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,195
for all of the times that I've hurt you.

372
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,572
Come inside for cookies?

373
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:41,190
What the fuck was that?

374
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,519
I'm still learning how
to bake, so no judging.

375
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,689
Well, go ahead. They're not poisoned.

376
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,699
But they might be.

377
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,589
Marina, why are you...

378
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,719
- Nice?
- Mm-hmm.

379
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,359
Well, this might surprise you...

380
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,829
but I made some bad choices in the past.

381
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:10,839
And I needed to fix that,
so I went to a trance healer.

382
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,119
Um...

383
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,269
she put a block on all the
parts of my personality

384
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,609
that made aggressive,

385
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:18,179
but ultimately
self-destructive, choices.

386
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,451
This feels like a scam.

387
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:24,879
That's a weird scam.

388
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,579
I'm not asking you for anything.

389
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:32,797
And you came to me. Seems
like you need something?

390
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,175
We're looking for The Couple.

391
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,629
Well, this has been great,

392
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,474
but I actually have to
get ready for church.

393
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:45,359
But you know who they are.

394
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,599
I know that going after them

395
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,060
is the very definition of
an "Old Marina" decision.

396
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,249
Look, I want to help you. I do, really.

397
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,070
If it was anything else...

398
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:59,089
But they have something we need

399
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,825
to stop the end of everything.

400
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,279
The World Seed.

401
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,329
The most valuable object in
the multiverse, people say...

402
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:11,039
which is why I wanted to steal it...

403
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,713
until you stopped the
Harmonic Convergence.

404
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:16,840
Wait, that was your
heist of the century?

405
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:18,909
Wait. So you could help us steal it.

406
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:19,999
No. No, no, no.

407
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,263
I-I don't do things like that anymore.

408
00:20:22,264 --> 00:20:26,224
Stealing from The Couple...
people will get hurt.

409
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,727
Way more people will get
hurt if you don't help us.

410
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,729
Alice, friends don't
make friends grapple

411
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,856
with the Trolley Problem.

412
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:36,485
They cut off my fingers.
There's no gray area here.

413
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,368
They're hiding the seed inside
a hotel called The Nave.

414
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,949
I've been there.

415
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,499
They only let in Magicians.
Everything about it is secret.

416
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,291
It has a vault.

417
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:54,003
It's the most secure
place on the planet.

418
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:56,119
But you had a plan to break in.

419
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,209
I had partners.

420
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:59,640
We spent months constructing a map

421
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:01,739
of every inch of that
hotel and its defenses.

422
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,119
We called it our heist book.

423
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,889
Problem is, things got really crazy,

424
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,476
and I don't actually know
where the book ended up.

425
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,150
But I know someone who might.

426
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,979
Hey, buddy. Been a minute.

427
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,099
Need some ice chips

428
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,069
- or something?
- Oh, Christ, no. Go away.

429
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,451
- Is that Gavin from the Library?
- He doesn't...

430
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:27,319
I don't work for the
sodding library anymore.

431
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,203
- Yeah.
- What happened to you?

432
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,373
She didn't tell you?

433
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:33,849
Marina hired me and a
few other poor bastards

434
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,349
to rob The Couple.

435
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,619
She didn't tell us that
the plan was suicidal

436
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,297
without the Harmonic Convergence.

437
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,999
Marina sent us in anyway.

438
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,049
One guy was killed,
horribly, I might add.

439
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,139
I was lucky.

440
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,029
But now I'm stuck here,
a bag of shattered bones,

441
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:51,259
can't travel, with fucking
Daryl over there

442
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,479
talking my fucking ear
off all day and night.

443
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,100
And so help me God, if you wake him up,

444
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:57,607
I will kill all of your mothers.

445
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:59,314
Marina beat you to that one.

446
00:21:59,315 --> 00:22:00,940
Then why are you working with her?

447
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:04,447
Marina, maybe you should step outside.

448
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:05,540
Mm.

449
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:12,279
We're not fans of Marina or The Couple,

450
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,639
but we need the World Seed.

451
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,041
So, if you could just give
us the heist book, we can...

452
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,043
I would sooner shit my cast.

453
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,129
Well, it looks like that's
gonna happen either way,

454
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,335
so why not help us?

455
00:22:20,336 --> 00:22:22,419
Because that would mean helping Marina.

456
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,059
And if you think I'm gonna do that,

457
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,659
then you have few 'roos loose
in the top paddock, love.

458
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:32,139
So either find a way to scratch
my ass or get the hell out.

459
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,394
That's why you did the spell
to make yourself good.

460
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:36,139
Because you sent them
on a suicide mission.

461
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,481
I thought maybe they'd get lucky.

462
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:41,276
- Well, they really didn't.
- We need that heist book.

463
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:44,149
How did you convince Gavin to
help you in the first place?

464
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,599
I had leverage.

465
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,919
Well, then use it now.

466
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,319
That would be deeply unethical.

467
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,457
I think I'm gonna go get him a smoothie.

468
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:58,501
- What?
- Ugh.

469
00:22:58,502 --> 00:22:59,878
If he won't help us, we're stuck.

470
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:01,499
We can't be stuck.

471
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,548
We need the book. We need Marina.

472
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,339
Or...

473
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,302
we need to be Marina.

474
00:23:08,846 --> 00:23:10,306
Oh, God.

475
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,893
Look, we understand.
You don't want to help us.

476
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:16,059
We can't make you,

477
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,729
but we can take down your wards.

478
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,439
You're a traveler.

479
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,401
Without mental wards,
you'll hear people's thoughts,

480
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:25,659
all day, all night, even
while they're sleeping.

481
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,249
If you do that while the Moon is borked,

482
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,322
my head will be, too.

483
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:31,399
I recently had several fingers
amputated and reattached.

484
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,244
I'd be more concerned
about that if I were you.

485
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:38,299
I underestimated you, Book Tart.

486
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,877
You're worse than Marina.

487
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:42,169
No.

488
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,673
Just desperate.

489
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,619
Bugger you all to hell. Stop.

490
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,264
The heist book.

491
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,183
I can't give it to you
because I don't have it.

492
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:57,159
- Who does?
- Anna.

493
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,937
She took it after things
went pear-shaped.

494
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,529
Who is Anna?

495
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:01,774
Ask her.

496
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,572
Well, now we have a real problem.

497
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,080
Is that Chinese and ice cream?

498
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:20,000
You could smell that?

499
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:22,209
I have a new superpower.
So what'd you get?

500
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,449
Uh, well, I-I...

501
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:26,739
Didn't know what you were craving,

502
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:29,427
so everything. Also...

503
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:34,229
The Circumstances Control Panel?

504
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,515
Did you steal that from the Lab?

505
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:37,229
Hyman helped.

506
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:40,079
We figured if The Couple is
gonna use the World Seed,

507
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,369
they need clean magic.

508
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:44,024
So, without this, they are stuck.

509
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:45,569
Hence, hiding it here.

510
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,486
If it were going to be here anyway,

511
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:49,599
I figured Lipson could come by,

512
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,059
do the treatments, run some scans...

513
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,079
two birds.

514
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,659
Right, but Lipson said
the baby was fine.

515
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,499
She said she needed to do more tests.

516
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,869
She said it might be dangerous.

517
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,459
And you said you'd have my back,

518
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,708
and instead, you're trapping me here?

519
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:04,319
She has to reapply the
treatments every couple hours.

520
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,379
I'm just looking out
for you and the baby.

521
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,439
I mean, somebody has to.

522
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,885
Oh, shit.

523
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:14,304
Sorry, I'll be quiet. Go on.

524
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:17,307
You can't eavesdrop on
people's shit like that.

525
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:18,309
But...

526
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,269
Yeah, Hyman, you have a body now.

527
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,021
You really need to
understand boundaries.

528
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:25,439
- So do you.
- Julia, wait.

529
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,196
Ooh. Uh-oh.

530
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,113
I stumbled upon this place last time

531
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:35,049
when I was looking for the bathroom.

532
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:37,619
This is where he keeps all of his...

533
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,629
pocket worlds.

534
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,589
What the fuck?

535
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:44,042
I swear, this place was
full of them last time.

536
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:46,336
Well, where the shit did they go?

537
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:49,039
Oh, "The Chankly Bore." Oh...

538
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,699
I grew up playing Queen of the Hump

539
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,799
on hills just like this.

540
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,844
If it isn't the ark,
I don't give a shit.

541
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:56,049
Okay...

542
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:57,219
Ghost butler?

543
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,099
I don't think it works like that.

544
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:02,179
You can't just summon him.
He's not our butler.

545
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,399
Oh! Hi.

546
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,689
Greetings. How may I assist you?

547
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,941
We're looking for a pocket world.

548
00:26:07,942 --> 00:26:09,776
The master of the house
is not available.

549
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:11,410
We know.

550
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,320
And so all pocket worlds
have been removed

551
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:14,573
for security purposes.

552
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:17,199
It's okay. Umber sent us to get it.

553
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,701
He... he told us it'd be here.

554
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,578
Which world did he send you to retrieve?

555
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,915
It's called The Ark.

556
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,120
Very well.

557
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:30,879
If Umber sent you on this task,

558
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,559
you should be able to
identify the true ark.

559
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,919
- But if you choose poorly...
- Ooh!

560
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:40,779
Uh, we age really fast,
and then we all turn to dust

561
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:43,184
- just like in "the Last Crusade."
- Indeed.

562
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:46,019
This security precaution is
inspired by my master's love

563
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,969
for "Indiana Jones and
the Last Crusade."

564
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:48,982
For copyright purposes,

565
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:51,049
the consequences of an incorrect choice

566
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:53,821
has been changed to
something more explosive.

567
00:26:53,822 --> 00:26:58,200
- Choose...
- Wisely. Yeah, we get it.

568
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:01,953
All right, Fen.

569
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:04,206
You're the Fillory expert. Have at it.

570
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,739
Any day now.

571
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,549
You know what?

572
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:20,249
Figure it out yourself.

573
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,969
You need to let me do the talking.

574
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:30,079
This is sensitive.

575
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,599
How did you fuck over Anna, huh?

576
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,099
She lose a limb or something?

577
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,709
Well, I definitely fucked her.

578
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:36,859
- Wait, she's your...
- Anna.

579
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:39,991
Marina.

580
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:43,162
- I want nothing to do with you.
- Anna, please.

581
00:27:43,163 --> 00:27:45,121
It's an emergency.

582
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:50,627
It wasn't just one lie.

583
00:27:50,628 --> 00:27:53,300
It was how one led to
another and another.

584
00:27:53,631 --> 00:27:55,713
And now I don't know
if any of it was real.

585
00:27:55,714 --> 00:27:58,509
Did you know that she was
from a different timeline?

586
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,136
'Cause I didn't.

587
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:02,138
And then you tried to rob The Couple.

588
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:05,183
Our friend died because of you.

589
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:08,629
I know. I was a terrible person.

590
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:12,319
I was a greedy, self-centered sociopath.

591
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,109
And when you left me, I deserved it.

592
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,569
But I'm making amends now.

593
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,259
I've done a bunch of
things on your list.

594
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,448
I got the trance healing done.

595
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:23,701
But yet, here you are,
asking for the heist book.

596
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,079
Oh, wait, no, that's just for us.

597
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,779
Or maybe this is just another lie,

598
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:31,501
and you aren't better,
y-you aren't different at all.

599
00:28:31,502 --> 00:28:34,963
Look, trust me. She is very different.

600
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:36,789
- I mean, she baked us cookies.
- Yeah.

601
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,259
Really terrible cookies.

602
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,552
I don't trust you, okay?
You showed up with her.

603
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:44,097
Just give us the book, and we'll go.

604
00:28:44,098 --> 00:28:46,769
We'll never pull her into our
life of crime ever again.

605
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:49,144
Marina doesn't have to
be involved anymore.

606
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,110
But I do.

607
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,699
I'm sorry. I literally can't lie.

608
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:02,069
This isn't simple like robbing a bank.

609
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,419
You can't do it without me.

610
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:06,244
And plus, I promised I would help you.

611
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:08,159
At least you're honest.

612
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:17,039
I'm gonna take the spell off Marina.

613
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,079
- What?
- The Healer would have used

614
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,439
a synaptic blocker...

615
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,674
easy to remove, even under
weird circumstances.

616
00:29:22,675 --> 00:29:24,929
You want to bring back the bad Marina?

617
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,919
To get the book,
we need her to tell Anna

618
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,319
that she's not gonna
help with the heist.

619
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,509
We need her to lie.

620
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:33,849
You're the one who said that
we should be like Marina.

621
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:36,025
This time we need the real Marina.

622
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,149
Yeah, I think she needs a minute.

623
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:44,439
- What are you doing?
- Word-as-bond spell.

624
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,819
It's a magically binding contract

625
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,859
that guarantees that you
will get the book for us

626
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,455
and, when you help us with the
heist, you won't fuck us over.

627
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:52,029
Well, you don't need that.

628
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,999
I mean, with the spell I'm under,

629
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,170
I couldn't betray you
even if I wanted to.

630
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,920
Better safe than sorry.

631
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:08,310
Julia? Are you here?

632
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,645
What are you doing?

633
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:14,920
Just stretching.

634
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,849
You're trying to put
yourself into stasis.

635
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,699
- What the hell, man?
- To be honest,

636
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,781
I haven't really enjoyed
this episode of my life.

637
00:30:23,782 --> 00:30:26,579
What is so great about
having a body anyway?

638
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,199
Y-you're hungry all the time.

639
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,279
Everything you do makes you sore.

640
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,839
You're pooping constantly.

641
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,679
That hasn't been my experience,

642
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,239
but your body's been in a bench

643
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,798
for a century, man. Give it a minute.

644
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:45,119
And when dramatic things are
happening to your friends,

645
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,678
you can't even watch.

646
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,681
This is about me and Julia?

647
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,729
You're pissed because
you can't listen in

648
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:57,699
on everyone's personal conversations?

649
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,569
- It's none of your business.
- But it is.

650
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:01,879
I put you two together.

651
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,155
I-I shipped you before you
even shipped yourselves.

652
00:31:05,156 --> 00:31:08,239
Before, I was a part of everything.

653
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,439
And now I am a, uh, minor character

654
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,490
in my own story.

655
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:15,909
God.

656
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:24,259
Well, that's...

657
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,789
that's the trade-off.

658
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:30,599
You don't get to spy on
people's intimate moments.

659
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,849
You get to live your own.

660
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:34,060
And that's supposed to be better?

661
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:38,159
If people wanted to talk to me,

662
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,357
you think I would have done
this in the first place?

663
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:44,445
So spying on the showers was...

664
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,488
Loneliness.

665
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,110
And horniness.

666
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:55,089
You're never gonna make a
connection by hiding, Hyman.

667
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:57,019
You got to put yourself out there.

668
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:00,751
Just be honest with people.

669
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,296
It may take a minute,

670
00:32:03,297 --> 00:32:05,716
but you'll find someone
who can stand you.

671
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,269
Ah, are you doing that thing

672
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,305
where you're giving me advice
but it's just for you?

673
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:13,329
No, I'm trying to...

674
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:18,659
Oh, God damn it.

675
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,300
I got to find Julia.

676
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:23,659
While I'm gone,

677
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,819
promise me you're not
gonna stasis yourself.

678
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,359
Well...

679
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,569
Give me the locket.

680
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:38,329
Talk to somebody. Have a conversation.

681
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:59,469
Hello? Is someone there?

682
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:07,459
Ah, Miss Wicker.

683
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,279
I have been looking for you.

684
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,326
Yes, it's come to this.

685
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,793
Sir Effingham, what are you
doing with that trash can?

686
00:33:22,794 --> 00:33:25,079
Some hapless fellow

687
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,005
left a sandwich of roast beef in there,

688
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,899
and as I could not get
to market today...

689
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,630
Oh! Oh, my heavens.

690
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:35,799
You have embraced the
blessing of your sex.

691
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,889
But surely you have misplaced
your wedding band?

692
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:41,311
You are widowed, then?

693
00:33:41,312 --> 00:33:43,139
- No.
- Oh, you poor dear.

694
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,189
You are carrying a bastard.

695
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,519
Definitely talking to one.

696
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,943
Look, I thought you chose
Todd for this quest.

697
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:52,614
I fear he is not the intrepid
hero I once thought him to be.

698
00:33:52,615 --> 00:33:53,879
You don't say.

699
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,279
Which is why,

700
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,669
in my gravest hour of need,

701
00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:01,199
I have come to vouchsafe you a quest.

702
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,957
Look, if this has to do with Fillory...

703
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:06,389
For my vision of Fillory's
demise has grown clearer.

704
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:09,759
I now see those who would bring
the apocalypse to Fillory

705
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,169
have visited many times before.

706
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:15,379
They enter from a distant
realm through a tree.

707
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:18,514
- Like a portal tree?
- Indeed.

708
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:22,169
These fiends plan to thieve
away every soul in the land

709
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:24,439
before they destroy it outright.

710
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,580
Huh.

711
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:29,689
How exactly do they do that?

712
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:33,160
My vision is hazy, but I do know

713
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:35,866
that they will turn back
the clock on Fillory,

714
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:37,979
resulting in ruin.

715
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,879
Um...

716
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,559
do these fiends... do they...

717
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:44,049
do they succeed in stealing the people

718
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:45,375
and building a new world for them?

719
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,179
That much I do not know because...

720
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:49,129
Wait.

721
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,672
I made no mention of a new world.

722
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,589
It is you.

723
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:55,920
It's for Fillory's own good.

724
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,049
The dead will rise.

725
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:58,722
This is the only way that
we can save everyone.

726
00:34:58,723 --> 00:35:00,209
Oh, hogwash!

727
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:03,929
What dark forces have
corrupted your fair mind?

728
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:06,619
You have. We wouldn't be on this quest

729
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,147
if you hadn't told me about
it in the first place.

730
00:35:08,148 --> 00:35:11,068
Are you now blaming me
for your own villainy?

731
00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:13,599
Oh, the ways of the sow

732
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,329
are nastier than I thought possible.

733
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:18,199
But... but know this.

734
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,203
The death of Fillory cannot
come without a cost.

735
00:35:21,204 --> 00:35:22,663
What do you mean?

736
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:28,540
Those who would destroy her
will lose the ones they love.

737
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,499
So we're sorry for treating you

738
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:50,329
like the friend who only gets
invited to trivia night.

739
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:53,469
You know I don't know what that means.

740
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:54,569
Yeah.

741
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,739
Will you please help us choose a globe?

742
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,319
Margo is chomping at the bit,

743
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,059
and Josh is holding her off
for as long as he can.

744
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:07,249
I thought I could talk myself into this.

745
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,211
But I just keep thinking,
if this was Earth,

746
00:36:11,212 --> 00:36:15,589
you would try a lot harder
to find some other way.

747
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,049
Yeah, probably.

748
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,219
So maybe it's my job
to represent Fillory.

749
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:24,199
But not just the people, the place...

750
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,699
the history,

751
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:29,349
the things we can't take with us.

752
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:32,816
You want my permission to destroy it.

753
00:36:34,443 --> 00:36:36,479
I can't give that to you.

754
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,573
Well, if you have any other
ideas, we are all ears.

755
00:36:39,574 --> 00:36:43,319
- Do you?
- No.

756
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:53,289
Was that supposed to do that?

757
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:56,380
Fillorians write down their
prayers to Umber and burn them.

758
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:58,799
This must be where they show up.

759
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,926
So they still pray to him
even though he's dead?

760
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,499
I know what you're thinking.

761
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,039
It's just like the people of Fillory

762
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,849
to do something so stupid.

763
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:10,059
No. I was thinking...

764
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:14,759
it's taken me a really long
time to, uh, figure out

765
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,980
that you can still love
something even after it's gone.

766
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:21,739
Even if you helped kill it?

767
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,709
Okay, Fen.

768
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:29,580
It's time for a "come to Umber" talk.

769
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,659
You don't want to be a sidekick?

770
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:35,299
You want to have a say?
This is what that feels like.

771
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,439
I'm not asking for your permission.

772
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,999
Some part of Fillory has to die,

773
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,059
and you're the one who has to choose.

774
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:43,269
Is it gonna be the rocks and the dirt?

775
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:45,779
Or is it gonna be the
people and the traditions

776
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:49,409
and all of the things that
you can take with you?

777
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:50,519
I got it!

778
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,685
Oh, no.

779
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:54,349
Aw, shit. I don't got it.

780
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:56,440
Oh!

781
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:57,525
Aah!

782
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,039
Oh. Oh! Oh!

783
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,879
It... it didn't explode. I-I did it.

784
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,173
I chose wisely. I'm wise.

785
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:23,999
All the people of Fillory...

786
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,887
are going to fit into a seahorse?

787
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:27,919
Mm-hmm.

788
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,807
How do you know that was the one?

789
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,759
Because that's how Ember and Umber

790
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,629
first brought people to Fillory.

791
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,289
They chartered the Great Seahorse

792
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:36,814
to carry us in his pouch.

793
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,059
Ah.

794
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,979
What?

795
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:42,359
How did people get to Earth?

796
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,399
Uh...

797
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,619
- The same.
- Well...

798
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,782
- The same.
- Mm-hmm.

799
00:38:46,350 --> 00:38:48,909
And I promise I won't
have anything to do

800
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:49,993
with robbing The Couple.

801
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,246
If you give the book to Kady and Alice,

802
00:38:52,247 --> 00:38:54,874
I'll never see it again.

803
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:57,540
Watching evil Marina
pretend to be good is...

804
00:38:58,879 --> 00:39:00,829
I feel like shit.

805
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:03,610
Yeah, I feel like shit, too.

806
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:13,579
Here. I'm glad to be rid of it.

807
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,560
- Is that...
- The heist book?

808
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:17,646
I know It doesn't look like much.

809
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:21,066
Thank you. You guys...

810
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:24,737
We have a lot of work to do... on us.

811
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:27,969
But we're gonna try now that I'm better.

812
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,576
Good.

813
00:39:30,577 --> 00:39:32,746
Okay, so I guess we're done here.

814
00:39:32,747 --> 00:39:36,169
And we won't bother you anymore.

815
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:37,199
Yeah.

816
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:46,299
Hey. I've been looking for you.

817
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,480
I saw the Pig Man again.

818
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:52,129
Turns out, you know that apocalypse

819
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:54,308
I've been trying to stop?

820
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:55,659
We cause it.

821
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:58,519
If the prophecy says that
Fillory is destroyed,

822
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:02,499
that means we succeed, right? I mean...

823
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,520
- good news?
- Yeah.

824
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,609
Good news.

825
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:09,439
Look, about earlier,
I need to tell you...

826
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,320
Look, I know. I was irresponsible.

827
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:13,369
Look, I should just accept the fact

828
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:16,939
that any control I had
over my life is now gone

829
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:19,079
and I am a walking incubator.

830
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,085
- Julia...
- It's just terrifying, you know?

831
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:24,546
What if Lipson does the
test and it's bad news?

832
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:26,507
You know, right now everything is good.

833
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:28,559
And the thought of losing
any of that is just...

834
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:33,260
Julia, it's not the baby
I'm freaking out about.

835
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,579
Look, I told you about how my dad left,

836
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:40,239
but what I didn't tell you...

837
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,148
what I haven't told anyone is...

838
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:46,379
around that time, my mom...

839
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,600
started having episodes.

840
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,419
Getting disoriented, hearing
shit that wasn't there.

841
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,489
Um...

842
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:58,679
the doctors thought it was just stress

843
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,914
from my dad bailing on us, but...

844
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:02,399
You think it's because of you.

845
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:10,239
What's happening to you...

846
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,160
looks just like what happened to my mom.

847
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:17,349
And the episodes didn't
stop when I was born.

848
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,079
They got worse.

849
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,024
When she burned down our apartment,

850
00:41:25,025 --> 00:41:28,528
it was the first time I got
thrown into foster care.

851
00:41:28,529 --> 00:41:33,400
She'd fight to get me back,
and then she'd get sick again.

852
00:41:35,452 --> 00:41:39,379
Eventually the state
took me in for good.

853
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,620
And I was scared, but...

854
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:46,629
I was more scared of my mom.

855
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,989
I fucked her up for life.

856
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,719
I'm so sorry.

857
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:59,699
I don't want what happened
to her to happen to you.

858
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:03,219
Okay. I get it.

859
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:06,239
I'll do it...

860
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,814
the scans, the treatments.

861
00:42:07,815 --> 00:42:09,519
But you have to know it won't be

862
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,149
like what happened to your mom.

863
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:13,572
We know about magic.

864
00:42:13,573 --> 00:42:15,950
We have ways to deal with it.

865
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,559
And I won't put you in a cage.

866
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:31,129
What the hell, man?

867
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:34,630
I tried to talk to him, and
he punched me in the face.

868
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,299
Who?

869
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,597
No. Mm-mm.

870
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:44,311
- I warned you not to cross me.
- How the hell did you get out?

871
00:42:44,312 --> 00:42:47,549
Let this be my last
lesson to you as dean.

872
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:51,360
Don't make too many enemies.
They might find each other.

873
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:53,259
The Couple.

874
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,243
Oh, I can't let you take
that panel out of here.

875
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,990
This is some "fate of the world" shit.

876
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:04,123
Not my world, not my problem.

877
00:43:04,124 --> 00:43:06,125
Then I guess I'm your problem.

878
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,669
Dean Fogg? What's going on?

879
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,719
Ha!

880
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,800
This just got very, very interesting.

881
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:17,379
Are you stupid enough
to try and stop me?

882
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:36,169
What just happened?

883
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:38,269
The Couple just got the
last thing they need.

884
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:40,899
They have the Seed,
the page, and the Panel.
