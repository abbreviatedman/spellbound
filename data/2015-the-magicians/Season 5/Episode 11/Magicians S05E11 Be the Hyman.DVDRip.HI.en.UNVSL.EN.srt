More of a pocket world, really.

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,858
I will get out of here,

13
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:32,696

If that doesn't buy us
a clean slate, then...

After I faked my own death, I
fled to Earth and built new worlds.

178
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,791
Didn't finish any. Did, too!

179
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,527
Mostly. I intended to rescue
my people from this chaotic place.

180
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,867
So, I also built an ark.

181
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,565
Like, a big-ass boat?

182
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:28,698
A pocket world.

183
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:33,576
A temporary vessel that pulls
every living Fillorian off the planet

184
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,981
so that I might deliver them
to a new, more perfect world.

185
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,520
So you're saying
we can use the Ark,

186
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:44,149
rescue the people, blow up
Fillory and stop the Dark King.

187
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:48,184
If anyone is going to destroy
this putrid stank-hole, it will be me.

JOSH: Guys.

193
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:01,131
FEN: <i>And then they just
slapped each other over and over</i>

194
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,207
for hours.

195
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:04,341
I think they forgot
we were there.

196
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,013
Okay, I'm just having a hard
time with the part where we

197
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,208
save Fillory by destroying it.

198
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:12,547
Yeah, seems extreme.

199
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:16,147
What happens to magic?
The Wellspring is on Fillory.

200
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,621
Well, we don't know.
But our only other choice

201
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:22,560
is to let the dead spill
into our world. Every world.

202
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,029
JOSH: The pocket
world is temporary,

203
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:25,574
so where do we
put all the Fillorians?

204
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:26,622
Earth?

205
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,634
Have you seen how we
treat our own refugees?

206
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:32,401
What about the World Seed?

207
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,270
From Q's page.
If we could find it,

208
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:40,074
we could use it to build a
new world. A new Fillory.

209
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:42,943
That's insane.

210
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:45,545
In a good way.

211
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,352
And a bad way.

212
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,918
I think the Couple have the
Seed and the page they stole

213
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,459
is just an instruction
manual, it's useless on its own.

214
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,928
And they went to some
pretty extreme lengths to get it.

215
00:09:56,996 --> 00:10:00,899
Upside is, we have time and the
moon will keep them from casting on it.

216
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,964
And it's in a dead
language I couldn't decipher.

217
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,436
I took pictures, but...

218
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:07,439
Okay, well if you work
on finding the Seed,

219
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,906
I can work on the language.

220
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:12,172
Sticking us with grabbing
the Ark-thingy from Umber's.

221
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,770
Well, Quentin and I went
once. It's in Vancouver.

222
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:17,317
Is your traveling
still jacked? Yeah.

223
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:20,011
But there is someone
who could help.

224
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:25,420
Okay, buddy.

225
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,859
If you can hear me,

226
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:32,729
be the Hyman.

Ah, this is incredible.
I love fingering things!

247
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,285
Right. Okay.

00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,048

a fucking pervert anymore.

Even white dudes can't
get away with that shit.

Most of the time.

253
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,200
People can see you,
and hear you, and...

254
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:18,705
And smell you.
Sorry, pregnancy nose.

255
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:20,965
No. Ah.

256
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,872
Ground rules, Hyman.

257
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:25,741
Okay, boys, let's get
back on mission, shall we?

258
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:28,508
We need you to travel some
people to Umber's house.

259
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:29,774

I'll do whatever you guys need.

262
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:37,856
Yeah, about that.

the address to Umber's.

(SCOFFS) Buddy,
I know my onions.

270

271
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,908
That must mean yes.

272
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,880
Oh.

273
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:03,945
Hey. Hi.

274
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,819
Remind me, you are...

00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:07,919
Fen.

00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,254

Fillory girl.

279
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,593
Of course, Fillory girl.

280
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:16,892
You're the one who loves forks.

281
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:19,264
What's got you grummy?

282
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:20,365
I'm fine.

283
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,764
As a seasoned viewer of people,

284
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,606
I think you're upset
because their plan is zany,

285
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:28,417
and you know if you
speak up, they won't listen.

286
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:33,175
(SCOFFS) What? No,
their plan is... is great.

287
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,611
And they do listen to me.

288
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:36,809
Didn't Eliot say
you were a hayseed

289
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,181
from a backwards,
prolapsed asshole of a planet?

290
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,318
Or were... You weren't...
Were you not there?

291
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,816
Okay, outsider
to outsider. Yeah?

292
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:49,361
Doesn't this feel like
the part in the story

293
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:52,489
where the good
guys are just wrong?

294
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,464
Hearts in the right place,

295
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:55,678
but they haven't
learned the lesson

296
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:57,466
of this little morality
play they're in yet,

297
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:59,199
so they have this crazy plan

298
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,672
that makes them almost
as bad as the villain.

299
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:03,140
Oh.

300
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,404
Or maybe it's just me.

301

(GASPS)

302
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,643
(GASPS) I did it.

303
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,313
Ha-ha!

304
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,355
I really did it.

305
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,233
We'll ring you when
we're ready to travel back.

306
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:20,123
I'm not coming with you inside?

307
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,889
We're all full up
on perverts, here.

308
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:23,228
Oh.

309
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,864
Oh, that's... That's fine.

310
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,263
I've got other stuff to do.

311
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,368
I'm...

312
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,199
Maybe I'll go google myself.

313
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,830
You know what?
Knock yourself out.

314
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:36,441
Bye.

(GROANS)

316
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,283
I'm sorry, the master of the
house isn't available right now.

317
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,819
Please return another time.

318
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,980
Wait, why does he look
like Umber but boring?

319
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:52,048
That's his human form, for
blending in with Canadians.

320
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:53,626
Must be another emanation.

321
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:57,891
He's a ghost butler! Who
ya gonna call? That guy!

322
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,465
We spoke to the horny
version of you in Fillory,

323
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,001
he sent us here to
get a thing. Can we?

324
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:05,296
In the beginning,
there was nothing.

325
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:09,906
Until a tigress, blind in one
eye, came to a lonely shore.

326
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,273
The tigress looked
upon this raw world and...

327
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,481
And what?

328
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:19,619
I'm sorry, the master of
the house isn't available.

329
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:22,450
I think ghost butler is broken.

330
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:26,287
Or it's a test. Solve the
puzzle, get in the door.

331
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:29,294
How could it be a test? He's
just spouting random nonsense.

332
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,195
Oh, it's not random.
It's Fillorian scripture.

333
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:36,730
The birth of Ember and Umber.
You guys haven't heard this story?

334
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:39,272
What happens next? (CHUCKLES)

335
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:46,312
Well, the Tigress, she waded
into the ocean and drowned herself.

336
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:49,246
And as her body disappeared
beneath the waves,

337
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,648
two shells washed ashore.

338
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:57,388
And from those shells came
Ember, and then his shadow, Umber.

339
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,850
Welcome.

Penny, did you know they
sell pre-sliced bread now?

That's the greatest invention
since... I don't even know what.

they magicians?

No. Uh, Dad was a
door-to-door snake salesman.

00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:49,139
Snake oil?

353
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:53,906
No. And my mom worked at a
brothel, you know, just mopping.

354
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,909
Okay, did she, um...

355
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:00,210
Did she suffer from
any mental problems?

356
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,546
Psychic stuff from
being pregnant with you?

357
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:05,454
Oh, no, nothing like that.

358
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,494
After the lobotomy,
she mostly just

359
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:11,998
sat on the porch and
sucked at bits of hay.

360
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,495
Other than that, she
was the perfect mother.

361
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:18,836
Okay, come on. Uh, I need
your help with something.

362
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:20,936
Put the sandwich down.

363
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,902
PETE: You want
to find the Couple?

364
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,742
They're a myth. Like the
Boogeyman, or Santa Claus.

365
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:32,011
Uh... Santa is very real.

366
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,677
And so are the Couple.

367
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,747
We met one of them.

368
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:41,217
The only other person that I know
who believes they're real is Marina.

369
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:45,163
The last time we saw her, we
screwed her over, moved the moon,

370
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,511
stopped the Harmonic
Convergence,

371
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,968
which she was going to use for
some heist-of-the-century type of deal.

372
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,038
I didn't say that
she'll help you.

373
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:54,633
I just said she's the
only one who can.

374
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:56,606
(SIGHS) (PETE MUNCHING)

375
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,414
Pretty by-the-numbers
defensive wards.

376
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,413
Marina's not a
by-the-numbers kind of girl.

377
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,256
You guys!

378
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,059
Come here. Uh...

379
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,259
Kady, I just wanted to tell you

380
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:27,932
that I am so sorry for all of
the times that I've hurt you.

381
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:31,303
Come inside for cookies?

382
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,540
What the fuck was that?

383
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,122
I'm still learning how to bake,

384
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:47,717
so no judging.

385
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:49,488
Go ahead. (CHUCKLES)

386
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:51,425
They're not poisoned.

387
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,432
But they might be?

388
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:56,161
Marina, why are you...

389
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,328
Nice? Mmm-hmm.

390
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:00,770
This may surprise
you... (CHUCKLES)

391
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,275
but I made some bad
choices in the past,

392
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,407
and I needed to fix that.

393
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:08,038
So I went to a
trance healer. Um...

394
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,143
She put a block on all
the parts of my personality

395
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:14,881
that made aggressive but
ultimately self-destructive choices.

396
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:17,120
This feels like a scam.

397
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:20,193
It's a weird scam.

398
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:23,041
I'm not asking you for anything.

399
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:25,296
And you came to me.

400
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,960
Seems like you need something?

401
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:32,869
We're looking for the Couple.

402
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:40,174
Well, this has been great, but I
actually have to get ready for church.

403
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:42,078
You know who they are.

404
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,308
I know that going after them

405
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:46,716
is the very definition of
an old Marina decision.

406
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,914
Look, I want to
help you. I do, really.

407
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,720
If it was anything else.

408
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:58,526
But they have something we
need to stop the end of everything.

409
00:19:58,931 --> 00:19:59,931
The World Seed.

410
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:04,200
The most valuable object
in the multiverse, people say.

411
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,704
Which is why I
wanted to steal it,

412
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,405
until you stopped the
Harmonic Convergence.

413
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:13,474
Wait, that was your
heist of the century?

414
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,538
So you could help us steal it.

415
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:18,914
No. No, no, no. I... I don't
do things like that anymore.

416
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,889
Stealing from the Couple,
people will get hurt.

417
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:25,424
Way more people will
get hurt if you don't help us.

418
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:26,856
Alice... (CHUCKLES)

419
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:29,521
friends don't make friends
grapple with the trolley problem.

420
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:33,123
They cut off my fingers.
There's no gray area here.

421
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:41,032
They're hiding the Seed
inside a hotel called The Nave.

422
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:43,572
I've been there.

423
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:44,974
They only let in Magicians.

424
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,277
Everything about it is secret.

425
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:50,682
Has a vault that's the most
secure place on the planet.

426
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,842
But you had a plan to break in.

427
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:53,918
I had partners.

428
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:56,251
We spent months
constructing a map

429
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:58,518
of every inch of that
hotel and its defenses.

430
00:20:58,591 --> 00:20:59,786
We called it our Heist Book.

431
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,460
The problem is,
things got really crazy

432
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:06,157
and I don't actually know
where the book ended up.

433
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:07,565
(SIGHS)

434
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:12,564
But I know someone who might.

435
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,602
Hey, buddy! Been a minute.

436
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:19,770
Need some ice chips or
something? Oh, Christ. No. Go away!

437
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:22,075
Is that Gavin from the
Library? He doesn't...

438
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:23,980
I don't work for the
sodding Library anymore!

439
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,813
Yeah. What happened to you?

440
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:27,045
She didn't tell you?

441
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,716
Marina hired me and a few other
poor bastards to rob the Couple.

442
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:34,287
She didn't tell us that
the plan was suicidal

443
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,953
without the Harmonic
Convergence.

444
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:37,723
Marina sent us in anyway.

445
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:40,733
One guy was killed.
Horribly, I might add.

446
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,761
I was lucky. (SCOFFS) But now I'm
stuck here, a bag of shattered bones,

447
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:48,103
can't travel, with
fucking Daryl over there

448
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:50,302
talking my fucking ear
off all day and night.

449
00:21:50,376 --> 00:21:54,211
And so help me God, if you wake
him up, I will kill all of your mothers.

450
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,941
Marina beat you to that one.

451
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:57,643
Then why are you
working with her?

452
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:01,109
Um, Marina, maybe
you should step outside.

453
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:02,187
Mmm.

454
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,954
We're not fans of
Marina or the Couple.

455
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:10,291
But we need the World Seed,

456
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:11,807
so if you could just
give us the Heist Book,

457
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,766
we can... I would
sooner shit my cast.

458
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:17,031
Well, it looks like that's gonna
happen either way, so why not help us?

459
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:19,037
Because that would
mean helping Marina.

460
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:20,800
And if you think
I'm gonna do that,

461
00:22:20,873 --> 00:22:23,342
then you have a few roos
loose in the top paddock, love.

462
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:27,540
So either find a way to scratch
my ass or get the hell out.

463
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,040
That's why you did the
spell to make yourself good.

464
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,830
Because you sent them
on a suicide mission.

465
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:35,116
I thought maybe
they'd get lucky.

466
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,382
Well, they really didn't.

467
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:37,979
ALICE: We need that Heist Book.

468
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:40,390
How did you convince Gavin
to help you in the first place?

469
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:43,362
I had leverage.

470
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:44,795
Well, then use it, now.

471
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,162
That would be deeply unethical.

If he won't help
us, we're stuck.

00:22:56,609 --> 00:23:00,205
We can't be stuck. We need
the book. We need Marina.

477
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:04,009
Or we need to be Marina.

478
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,019
(DOOR OPENS) Oh, God.

479
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:10,550
Look, we understand.
You don't want to help us.

480
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:14,387
We can't make you. But we
can take down your wards.

481
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,055
ALICE: You're a Traveler.

482
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:19,063
Without mental wards,
you'll hear people's thoughts.

483
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:22,293
All day, all night. Even
while they're sleeping.

484
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:25,028
If you do that while the moon
is borked, my head will be, too.

485
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:28,102
I recently had several fingers
amputated and reattached.

486
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:30,047
I'd be more concerned
about that if I were you.

(SCOFFS)

488
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:36,538
I underestimated you, book
tart. You're worse than Marina.

489
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:40,280
No. Just desperate.

492
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:49,885
(SIGHS) The Heist Book?

493
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:51,842
I can't give it to you,
because I don't have it.

494
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:52,931
Who does?

495
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:55,558
Anna. She took it after
things went pear-shaped.

496
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:56,634
Who is Anna?

497
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:58,469
(DOOR OPENS) Ask her.

498
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:05,807
Well, now we have
a real problem.

00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,240
(DOOR OPENS)

500
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:13,784
Is that Chinese and ice cream?

501
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:16,682
You could smell that?

502
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,917
I have a new superpower.
So, what'd you get?

503
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:23,457
Well, I... (CHUCKLES) I didn't
know what you were craving,

504
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:26,089
so, everything. Also...

505
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:30,866
The Circumstances control panel?

506
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,213
Did you steal that from the lab?

507
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:33,398
Hyman helped.

508
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:36,807
We figured if the Couple is
going to use the World Seed,

509
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:40,642
they need clean magic. So,
without this, they are stuck.

510
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:42,238
Hence, hiding it here.

511
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,112
If it were going to
be here anyway,

512
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:47,153
I figured Lipson could
come by, do the treatments,

513
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,687
run some scans, two birds.

514
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,348
Good, but Lipson
said the baby was fine.

515
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:53,324
She said she needed
to do more tests.

516
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:55,519
She said it might be dangerous.

517
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:57,095
And you said you'd have my back,

518
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,721
and instead you're
trapping me here?

519
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,959
She has to reapply the
treatments every couple hours.

520
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:03,025
I'm just looking out
for you and the baby.

521
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,102
I mean, somebody has to.

Sorry, I'll be quiet. Go on.

524
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:14,011
You can't eavesdrop
on people's shit like that.

525
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:15,113
But...

526
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,012
Yeah, Hyman, you
have a body now.

527
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:18,716
You really need to
understand boundaries.

528
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:22,179
So do you. Julia, wait.

(HUMS MOCKINGLY)

531
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,652
I stumbled upon this place last time
when I was looking for the bathroom.

532
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,222
This is where he
keeps all of his

533
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:35,926
pocket worlds.

534
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:40,738
What the fuck? I swear, this
place was full of them last time.

535
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,705
Well, where the
shit did they go?

536
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:43,775
Oh.

537
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,708
The Chankly Bore. Aw.

538
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:48,504
I grew up playing Queen of
the Hump on hills just like this.

539
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,549
If it isn't the Ark,
I don't give a shit.

540
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,707
ELIOT: Okay. (CLAPS HANDS)

541
00:25:52,785 --> 00:25:54,083

542
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:55,711
Uh, I don't think
it works like that.

543
00:25:55,788 --> 00:25:57,313
You can't just summon him.

544
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,789
He's not our butler.

545
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:00,052
(CHUCKLES) Oh!

546
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,159
Hi.

547
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,320
Greetings. How may I assist you?

548
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,675
We're looking
for a pocket world.

549
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,426

ALL: We know.

551
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:11,262
And so, all pocket worlds have
been removed for security purposes.

552
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:15,364
It's okay. Umber sent us to
get it. He told us it'd be here.

553
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:17,273
Which world did he
send you to retrieve?

554
00:26:17,376 --> 00:26:19,572
It's called the Ark.

555
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:22,346
Very well.

00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,712
(RUSTLING)

557
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:27,611
If Umber sent you on this task,

558
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:30,211
you should be able
to identify the true Ark.

559
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:32,884
But if you choose poorly...

560
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:37,526
Ooh. Uh, we age really fast
and then we all turn to dust

561
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:38,894

All right, Fen. You're the

You know what?
Figure it out yourself.

572
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,511
You need to let me do
the talking. This is sensitive.

573
00:27:27,613 --> 00:27:30,606
How'd you fuck over Anna, huh?
She lose a limb or something?

574
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:32,150
Well, I definitely fucked her.

575
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:33,879
Wait, she's your... Anna!

576
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,580
ANNA: Marina.

577
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:39,687
I want nothing to do with
you. MARINA: Anna, please.

578
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:42,191
It's an emergency.

(SIGHS)

580
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:48,024
It wasn't just one lie.

581
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:50,830
It was how one led to
another and another,

582
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:53,134
and now I don't know
if any of it was real.

583
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:55,900
Did you know that she was
from a different timeline?

584
00:27:56,642 --> 00:27:59,510
'Cause I didn't. And then
you tried to rob the Couple.

585
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:02,604
Our friend died because of you.

586
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:06,083
I know. I was a terrible person.

587
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:09,849
I was a greedy,
self-centered sociopath.

588
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:11,550
And when you left
me, I deserved it.

589
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:14,315
But I'm making amends now.

590
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,704
I've done a bunch
of things on your list.

591
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:17,872
I got the trance healing done.

592
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:21,060
But yet here you are,
asking for the Heist Book.

593
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,499
Uh... Wait, no,
that's just for us.

594
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:25,162
Or maybe this is
just another lie...

595
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:28,730
(VOICE QUAVERING) and you
aren't better, you aren't different at all.

596
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:32,341
Look, trust me,
she is very different.

597
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:34,175
I mean, she baked us cookies.

598
00:28:34,513 --> 00:28:36,243
Really terrible cookies.

599
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,944
I don't trust you, okay?
You showed up with her.

600
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:41,518
Just give us the
book, and we'll go.

601
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:44,250
We'll never pull her into
our life of crime ever again.

602
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:46,036
Marina doesn't have
to be involved anymore.

603
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:51,260
But I do.

604
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:55,133
I'm sorry, I
literally can't lie.

605
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:59,399
This isn't simple,
like robbing a bank.

606
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:00,870
You can't do it without me.

607
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:03,670
And yes, I promised
I would help you.

608
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,107
At least you're honest.

609
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,410
I'm gonna take
the spell off Marina.

610
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:15,578
What?

611
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:17,849
The Healer would have
used a synaptic blocker.

612
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,051
Easy to remove, even
under weird circumstances.

613
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,321
You want to bring
back the bad Marina?

614
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:26,796
To get the book, we need her to tell Anna
that she's not gonna help with the heist.

615
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:27,922
We need her to lie.

616
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,732
You're the one who said
that we should be like Marina.

617
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:33,395
This time we need
the real Marina.

It's a magically-binding
contract that guarantees

that you will get
the book for us.

624
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:47,809
And when you help us with
the heist, you won't fuck us over.

You don't need that.

626
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:51,183
I mean, with this
spell I'm under,

627
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,589
I couldn't betray you
even if I wanted to.

Better safe than sorry.

You're trying to put yourself
into stasis. The hell, man?

To be honest, I haven't really
enjoyed this episode of my life.

634
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,986
What is so great about
having a body, anyway?

do makes you sore.

You're pooping constantly.

That hasn't been my experience,

639
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:39,170
but your body's been in a bench
for a century, man. Give it a minute.

And when dramatic things are happening
to your friends, you can't even watch.

even shipped yourselves.

That's the trade-off.

00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:27,049
You don't get to spy on
people's intimate moments.

653
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:29,245
You get to live your own.

to be better?

you think I would have
done this in the first place?

00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:47,223
Look, I thought you
chose Todd for this quest?

697
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:50,853
I fear he is not the intrepid
hero I once thought him to be.

698
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:52,222
You don't say.

699
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:56,028
Which is why, in my
gravest hour of need,

700
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:59,036
I have come to
vouchsafe you a quest.

701
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:00,982
Look, if this has
to do with Fillory...

702
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:04,408
For my vision of Fillory's
demise has grown clearer!

703
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:08,071
I now see those who would
bring the apocalypse to Fillory

704
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,239
have visited many times before.

705
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:13,614
They enter from a distant
realm through a tree.

706
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:16,786
Like, a portal tree? Indeed.

707
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,187
These fiends plan to thieve away

708
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:22,853
every soul in the land
before they destroy it outright.

709
00:34:22,928 --> 00:34:23,952
Huh.

710
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:27,891
How exactly do they do that?

711
00:34:27,966 --> 00:34:30,162
My vision is hazy.
(INHALES SHARPLY)

712
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:34,172
But I do know that they will
turn back the clock on Fillory,

713
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,333
resulting in ruin!

714
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:37,432
Um...

715
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:39,769
Do these fiends...

716
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:43,645
Do they succeed in stealing the
people and building a new world for them?

717
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,512
That much I do not know
because...(SNORTS)

718
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:48,952
Wait, I made no
mention of a new world.

719
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,823
It is you!

720
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,187
It's for Fillory's own good.

721
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:56,999
The dead will rise. This is the
only way that we can save everyone.

722
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:02,124
Oh, hogwash. What dark forces
have corrupted your fair mind?

723
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:03,292
You have.

724
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:05,379
We wouldn't be on this
quest if you hadn't told me

725
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:06,447
about it in the first place.

726
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:09,373
Are you now blaming
me for your own villainy?

727
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:14,576
Oh, the ways of the sow are
nastier than I thought possible.

728
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:19,448
But know this, the death of
Fillory cannot come without a cost.

729
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:20,951
What do you mean?

730
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:25,655
Those who would destroy
her will lose the ones they love.

731
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:26,781
Hmm.

732
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,470
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACH)

733
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,036
ELIOT: So, we're sorry

734
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:47,670
for treating you like the friend
who only gets invited to trivia night.

735
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:50,978
You know I don't
know what that means.

736
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:52,783
Yeah.

737
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:55,786
(SIGHS)

738
00:35:56,855 --> 00:35:58,949
Will you please help
us choose a globe?

739
00:35:59,024 --> 00:36:00,617
Margo is chomping at the bit

740
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:02,854
and Josh is holding her
off for as long as he can.

741
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:05,488
I thought I could
talk myself into this.

742
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:09,429
But I just keep thinking,
if this was Earth,

743
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:13,802
you would try a lot harder
to find some other way.

744
00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:15,773
Yeah, probably.

745
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:18,435
So maybe it's my job
to represent Fillory.

746
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:22,078
But not just the
people, the place.

747
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,709
The history.

748
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:25,908
The things we
can't take with us.

749
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:31,050
You want my
permission to destroy it.

750
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:34,683
I can't give that to you.

751
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:37,558
Well, if you have any
other ideas, we are all ears.

752
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,255
Do you?

753
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:41,231
No.

754
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:49,932
Was that supposed to do that?

755
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:54,576
(CHUCKLES) Fillorians write down
their prayers to Umber and burn them.

756
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,671
This must be where they show up.

757
00:36:57,015 --> 00:36:59,177
So they still pray to him,
even though he's dead?

758
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,741
I know what you're thinking.

759
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:05,014
It's just like the people of
Fillory to do something so stupid.

760
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:07,218
No. I was thinking

761
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:12,888
it's taken me a really
long time to figure out

762
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:16,526
that you can still love
something, even after it's gone.

763
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,230
Even if you helped kill it?

764
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,232
(SIGHS SOFTLY)

765
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:27,372
Okay, Fen, it's time for
a come-to-Umber talk.

766
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:31,043
You don't want to be a
sidekick? You want to have a say?

767
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:33,311
This is what that feels like.

768
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:35,216
I'm not asking for
your permission.

769
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,149
Some part of Fillory has to die,

770
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,156
and you're the one
who has to choose.

771
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,590
Is it going to be the
rocks and the dirt,

772
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:43,958
or is it gonna be the
people and the traditions

773
00:37:44,062 --> 00:37:46,327
and all of the things that
you can take with you?

774
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:48,565
MARGO: I got it!

775
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:49,726
(SOFT EXPLOSION) Oh, no.

776
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:52,396
MARGO: Ah, shit. I don't got it!

777
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:55,472
JOSH: Aah!

778
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:12,949
(GASPS) Oh! Oh!

779
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:15,788
It didn't explode!
I... I did it!

780
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:19,154
I chose wisely! I'm wise!

781
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:25,102
All the people of Fillory are
going to fit into a seahorse?

782
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,194
Hmm?

783
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,966
How'd you know that was the one?

784
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:31,507
Because that's how Ember and
Umber first brought people to Fillory.

785
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:35,011
They chartered the great
seahorse to carry us in his pouch.

786
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:36,206
Oh.

787
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,148
FEN: What?

788
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:40,276
How'd people get to Earth?

789
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:41,552
Um...

790
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,918
(CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY)
Mmm-hmm. The same. The same.

791
00:38:46,224 --> 00:38:49,490
And I promise I won't have anything
to do with robbing the Couple.

792
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:53,362
If you give the book to Kady
and Alice, I'll never see it again.

793
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:57,025
Watching evil Marina
pretend to be good is...

794
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:00,028
I feel like shit.

795
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:03,168
KADY: (SIGHS) Yeah,
I feel like shit, too.

796
00:39:10,315 --> 00:39:11,315
Here.

797
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:13,783
I'm glad to be rid
of it. ALICE: Is that...

798
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:17,152
The Heist Book? I know
it doesn't look like much.

799
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:18,546
Thank you.

800
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:20,591
Are you guys...

801
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:24,220
We have a lot of
work to do, on us.

802
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:27,532
But we're going to
try. Now that I'm better.

(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

804
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:32,196
ALICE: Great. Okay. So,
I guess we're done here.

805
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:35,271
And, um, we won't
bother you anymore.

806
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:37,241
Yeah.

807
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,745
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACH)

808
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:43,847
PENNY: Hey.

809
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:45,815
I've been looking for you.

810
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:47,746
Saw the Pig Man again.

811
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:53,220
Turns out, you know that
apocalypse I've been trying to stop?

812
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:55,153
We cause it.

813
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:58,060
If the prophecy says
that Fillory is destroyed,

814
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:00,563
that means we
succeed, right? And...

815
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:04,029
Good news? JULIA: Yeah.

816
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,162
Good news.

817
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:09,105
Look, about earlier,
I need to tell you...

818
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:11,005
Look, I know. I
was irresponsible.

819
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,873
Look, I should just
accept the fact that

820
00:40:12,944 --> 00:40:16,472
any control I had over
my life is now gone,

821
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:19,312
and I am a walking
incubator. Julia.

822
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,628
It's just terrifying, you know?

823
00:40:20,652 --> 00:40:24,089
What if Lipson does the
tests and it's bad news?

824
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:26,054
You know, right now
everything is good.

825
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:28,184
And the thought of
losing any of that is just...

826
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,457
Julia, it's not the baby
I'm freaking out about.

827
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:38,261
Look, I told you about how my
dad left. But what I didn't tell you,

828
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:42,601
what I haven't told anyone is,

829
00:40:42,674 --> 00:40:48,045
around that time, my mom
started having episodes.

830
00:40:51,049 --> 00:40:54,451
Getting disoriented, hearing
shit that wasn't there. Um...

831
00:40:56,254 --> 00:40:58,155
Doctors thought
it was the stress,

832
00:40:58,256 --> 00:41:00,157
from my dad
bailing on us, but...

833
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:01,954
You think it's because of you.

834
00:41:06,264 --> 00:41:08,927
What's happening to you

835
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:12,804
looks just like what
happened to my mom.

836
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,938
And the episodes didn't
stop when I was born.

837
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:18,404
They got worse.

838
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:24,112
When she burned
down our apartment

839
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:27,944
was the first time I got
thrown into foster care.

840
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:32,690
She'd fight to get me back,
and then she'd get sick again.

841
00:41:34,726 --> 00:41:37,491
Eventually the state
took me in for good.

842
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,792
And I was scared,

843
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,834
but I was more scared of my mom.

844
00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:50,332
I fucked her up for life.

845
00:41:54,312 --> 00:41:55,312
I'm so sorry.

846
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,316
I don't want what happened
to her to happen to you.

847
00:41:59,317 --> 00:42:01,286
Okay. I get it.

848
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:04,148
I'll do it.

849
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:07,348
The scans, the treatments.

850
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:10,485
But you have to know, it won't be
like what happened to your mom.

851
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:12,462
We know about magic.

852
00:42:13,398 --> 00:42:15,333
We have ways to deal with it.

853
00:42:17,335 --> 00:42:18,997
And I won't put you in a cage.

854
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,514
What the hell, man?

855
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:34,182
I tried to talk to him and
he punched me in the face!

856
00:42:34,252 --> 00:42:35,252
PENNY: Who?

857
00:42:36,087 --> 00:42:37,087
Oh. Mmm-mmm.

858
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:42,550
I warned you not to cross me.

859
00:42:42,627 --> 00:42:43,856
How the hell'd you get out?

860
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:46,693
Let this be my last
lesson to you as Dean.

00:42:47,198 --> 00:42:50,896
Don't make too many enemies.
They might find each other.

Oh, I can't let you take
that panel out of here.

This is some fate
of the world shit.

Not my world. Not my
problem. (DOOR OPENS)

00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:08,978
Dean Fogg? What's going on?

869
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:13,380
Huh. This just got
very, very interesting.

870
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:16,759
Are you stupid enough
to try and stop me?

871
00:43:19,564 --> 00:43:20,691
(CHUCKLES QUIETLY)

872
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,712
What just happened?

873
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,544
The Couple just got
the last thing they need.

874
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,175
They have the Seed,
the page and the panel.

875
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:43,417
We gotta tell the others. They
need to steal that Seed now.
