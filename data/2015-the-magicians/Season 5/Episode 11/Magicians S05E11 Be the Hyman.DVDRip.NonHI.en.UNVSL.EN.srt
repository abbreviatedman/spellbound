00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:02,902
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,370
<i>The Couple has power and
they are not good people.</i>

3
00:00:05,472 --> 00:00:09,136
Give me the page. If the
finger's still viable, I reattach.

4
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:11,807
I'm Hyman. Cooper.

5
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:13,871
I was a student
here in the 1920s.

6
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:16,450
A Traveler. Someone
moved my body.

7
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,543
I stole this. Stasis charm.

8
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:20,211
<i>Freezes the wearer in time.</i>

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,380
Holy shit. Umber?

10
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:25,118
You make for an excellent
focus group for my new world.

11
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:26,990
More of a pocket world, really.

12
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,858
I will get out of here,

13
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:32,696
and then, I'll turn you
into lobsters and eat you.

14
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,006
Hey, what happened to your eye?

15
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:35,194
<i>I lent it to Josh.</i>

16
00:00:35,302 --> 00:00:36,827
My own personal Mar-GoPro.

17
00:00:36,904 --> 00:00:39,305
Josh didn't die. He
was in the Taker Realm.

18
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,239
That's not possible.

19
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:44,072
<i>Somebody opened a door that
should not have been opened.</i>

20
00:00:44,177 --> 00:00:45,770
It could mean the
end of everything.

21
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,404
I think I can't do
what I need to do

22
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,574
if I'm worried about
how it's gonna affect you.

23
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:50,763
I think we need to be done.

24
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:53,047
My pregnancy is
going to be sped up?

25
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:54,212
It's Red Monkey Month.

26
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:56,483
Everything goes faster
in Red Monkey Month.

27
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:58,037
Wait, so you're
saying that's a thing?

28
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:01,186
Me being able to take
on what the baby can do?

29
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,261
Maybe.

30
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,388
<i>Well, maybe this
baby's a Traveler.</i>

31
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:09,236
Yeah, uh, we
should probably talk.

32
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:15,601
Seems like I missed a lot here.

33
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,438
It's actually super simple.

34
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:19,536
The Dark King AKA Rupert Chatwin

35
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:22,708
is trying to jailbreak his dead
lover out of Hell or whatever,

36
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:24,775
so he needs to get rid
of the guard dogs first.

37
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:29,516
Hence using you as a human
smallpox blanket to kill the Takers.

38
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,253
Yeah. Uh, I meant more like...

39
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:34,994
Uh...

40
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:37,421
Contraception wards are
supposed to be foolproof.

41
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:39,625
Don't worry, my
uterus is on lock.

42
00:01:39,733 --> 00:01:44,228
Right, 'cause a werewolf
baby could be... Yikes.

43
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:46,633
But potentially very cute.

44
00:01:47,374 --> 00:01:48,467
Fucking adorable.

45
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,312
Some day. Not now.

46
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,644
I'm not giving birth to
a goddamn litter, Josh.

47
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:57,115
Besides,

48
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,652
I thought we were done.

49
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,484
You risked your sanity to
save me from the Taker Realm.

50
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,755
If that doesn't buy us
a clean slate, then...

51
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:16,729
So, can we skip to
the reunion banging?

52
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,806
You're wearing three rubbers.

53
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:22,875
At least.

54
00:02:30,283 --> 00:02:31,394
Have you been to a doctor?

55
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:34,946
They don't exactly have
ultrasounds in Fillory.

56
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,890
Have you thought about
what this means for us?

57
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:43,497
What do you want it to mean?

58
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,159
We broke up for good reasons.

59
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:47,758
None of that has changed.

60
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,966
My dad wasn't around for long.

61
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:58,006
My mom... Look, I'm
not doing that to our kid.

62
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:01,506
I want to be there
for him... Her?

63
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:03,244
No clue yet.

64
00:03:05,052 --> 00:03:06,680
I want you to be there, too.

65
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,313
You guys?

66
00:03:08,388 --> 00:03:12,018
Um, I'm sorry, but,
um, there's a problem.

67
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:15,859
We were in the elevator and
Eliot and Fen just collapsed.

68
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:19,689
Hello?

69
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,167
Hello?

70
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,173
Anyone?

71
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:35,014
My...

72
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:36,475
Eliot?

73
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:38,584
Oh.

74
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,052
It's you.

75
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:45,048
What kind of Fillorian nonsense
is this? Or am I dreaming?

76
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:46,684
I know I'm not.

77
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,524
In my dreams you're nice to me.

78
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,354
What the shit is going on?

79
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:53,725
Whoa! Oh!

80
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:56,963
Look away! Look
away! Still draping here.

81
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,598
We were just settling on safe
words when we woke up here.

82
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,409
Any idea why?

83
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:03,509
Mmm.

84
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,409
Yoo-hoo!

85
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:18,055
Welcome, High Kings!

86
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:20,387
Ember, I thought you were dead.

87
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,227
Oh, I am an energetic
emanation, my dear blinking idiot.

88
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:27,233
A message left by
the great god Ember

89
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,270
to forewarn of
impending apocalypse.

90
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:32,431
I've met this guy
before. Mmm-hmm.

91
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:33,506
I have brought you here

92
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,475
because you are the living
former High Kings of Fillory,

93
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:41,776
and your kingdom rests on
the knife's edge of annihilation.

94
00:04:42,749 --> 00:04:44,775
Ooh!

95
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:48,921
Huh.

96
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,106
You do realize I have
other things to do.

97
00:05:06,173 --> 00:05:07,300
Whatever.

98
00:05:07,374 --> 00:05:09,639
I just had to pull
Josh's pants back on,

99
00:05:09,743 --> 00:05:10,972
so, diagnose.

100
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:12,077
They're asleep.

101
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,774
I mean, obviously
they're cursed or whatever,

102
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:17,113
but beyond that? Just wait
and see if they wake up.

103
00:05:17,184 --> 00:05:18,516
Should we just slap them?

104
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,177
Believe me, I tried.

105
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:22,620
I'm going to see what we
have on narcolepsy spells.

106
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,858
You were not pregnant
the last time I saw you.

107
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:29,224
Like, at all.

108
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:32,624
Oh, yeah, well,
things happened fast.

109
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,952
Everything looks fine for now,
but I should do more scans.

110
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,651
It looks like you
have fast-forwarded

111
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,166
through the first
two trimesters.

112
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:44,243
You're ready to pop.

113
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,775
Accelerated pregnancies
can be dangerous.

114
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,839
And, uh, it's a hybrid.

115
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:51,475
Have you had any side
effects? Psychic episodes?

116
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:54,214
Uh, yes. That I kind
of caused myself.

117
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:56,654
Yeah, she had to,
to get out of, well,

118
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,658
a dungeon, but none since.

119
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:01,591
Um, actually, that's
not entirely true.

120
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:02,695
Wait, what?

121
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:04,876
A couple of aftershocks,
but it's really no big deal.

122
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:06,729
I've already put up
every mental ward I know.

123
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:07,833
Okay.

124
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:09,501
There are treatments,

125
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,333
but they have to
be applied regularly,

126
00:06:11,404 --> 00:06:13,737
and the only place where
it's safe to cast right now is...

127
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,840
The Brakebills lab.

128
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:17,173
Because the moon
is still pissed at us.

129
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:18,588
Uh, look, I'll be there
the minute I can.

130
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:20,342
We're just dealing
with some stuff.

131
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:23,542
Clearly. Don't wait too long.

132
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:29,565
As you ought to remember,

133
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:32,684
I am activated by world war,
pandemic, revolt of dwarves...

134
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,284
Or the mass rising of the dead.

135
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,226
Yeah, we know.
We're already on it.

136
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:38,595
Huzzah! And I have
summoned all of you

137
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:42,726
because the current ruler is
the nitwit causing the problem.

138
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,896
The thing is, he's
sort of unkillable.

139
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,206
I rescind my huzzah.

140
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:50,472
In addition to being
just very creepy,

141
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:54,446
the dead drain life, contaminating
everything they touch,

142
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:56,880
like a pickle on a sandwich.

143
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:57,950
I like pickles.

144
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:00,043
Behold! A dead person

145
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,248
wriggling from their grave!

146
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:09,127
And this is every Fillorian
who has ever lived.

147
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:15,792
You see? The pickles of
the dead will ruin Fillory.

148
00:07:15,902 --> 00:07:18,371
You must stop this,
whatever the cost.

149
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,237
Well, the cost is blowing
up the entire planet.

150
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:22,428
Which is... A decent option?

151
00:07:22,475 --> 00:07:24,307
I was going to say
counterproductive.

152
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:26,971
Only if you care about
peasants. Which I do not.

153
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:32,145
You want to get that, or...

154
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:36,781
Oh, no, that's just... A
mouse farted or something.

155
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:40,653
A very gassy mouse.

156
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:46,828
Umber.

157
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:50,927
It is I, an energetic
emanation of Umber!

158
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:52,438
Great God of... Piss off.

159
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:53,996
Nobody wants you here.

160
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:58,135
I have heard your lamentations,
and am here to help.

161
00:07:58,244 --> 00:08:00,179
I was designed to intervene

162
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,512
if my anarchist brother
tries something stupid,

163
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:06,108
like blowing up the planet.

164
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,548
Do you have a better suggestion?

165
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:11,352
I do, sweet Matron of Fillory.

166
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:16,559
After I faked my own death, I
fled to Earth and built new worlds.

167
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,791
Didn't finish any. Did, too!

168
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,527
Mostly. I intended to rescue
my people from this chaotic place.

169
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,867
So, I also built an ark.

170
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,565
Like, a big-ass boat?

171
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:28,698
A pocket world.

172
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:33,576
A temporary vessel that pulls
every living Fillorian off the planet

173
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,981
so that I might deliver them
to a new, more perfect world.

174
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,520
So you're saying
we can use the Ark,

175
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:44,149
rescue the people, blow up
Fillory and stop the Dark King.

176
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:48,184
If anyone is going to destroy
this putrid stank-hole, it will be me.

177
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,859
Oh, my gods.

178
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:58,531
Guys.

179
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:01,131
<i>And then they just slapped
each other over and over</i>

180
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,207
for hours.

181
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:04,341
I think they forgot
we were there.

182
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,013
Okay, I'm just having a hard
time with the part where we

183
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,208
save Fillory by destroying it.

184
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:12,547
Yeah, seems extreme.

185
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:16,147
What happens to magic?
The Wellspring is on Fillory.

186
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,621
Well, we don't know.
But our only other choice

187
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:22,560
is to let the dead spill
into our world. Every world.

188
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,029
The pocket world is temporary,

189
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:25,574
so where do we
put all the Fillorians?

190
00:09:25,598 --> 00:09:26,622
Earth?

191
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,634
Have you seen how we
treat our own refugees?

192
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:32,401
What about the World Seed?

193
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,270
From Q's page.
If we could find it,

194
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:40,074
we could use it to build a
new world. A new Fillory.

195
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:42,943
That's insane.

196
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:45,545
In a good way.

197
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:47,352
And a bad way.

198
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,918
I think the Couple have the
Seed and the page they stole

199
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,459
is just an instruction
manual, it's useless on its own.

200
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,928
And they went to some
pretty extreme lengths to get it.

201
00:09:56,996 --> 00:10:00,899
Upside is, we have time and the
moon will keep them from casting on it.

202
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,964
And it's in a dead
language I couldn't decipher.

203
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,436
I took pictures, but...

204
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:07,439
Okay, well if you work
on finding the Seed,

205
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,906
I can work on the language.

206
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:12,172
Sticking us with grabbing
the Ark-thingy from Umber's.

207
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,770
Well, Quentin and I went
once. It's in Vancouver.

208
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:17,317
Is your traveling
still jacked? Yeah.

209
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:20,011
But there is someone
who could help.

210
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:25,420
Okay, buddy.

211
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,859
If you can hear me,

212
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:32,729
be the Hyman.

213
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:58,820
I'm alive?

214
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,160
Yeah.

215
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,341
Thank you. Thank you.

216
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:38,631
Ah.

217
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,098
Whore!

218
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,001
Ugh.

219
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:45,837
Just kidding.

220
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:48,874
Ah.

221
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:53,012
Oh, my God.

222
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:57,581
Ah, this is incredible.
I love fingering things!

223
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,285
Right. Okay.

224
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,048
How about a few

225
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:04,716
being-alive-in-the-21st-century
ground rules? Mmm.

226
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:08,591
First of all, you can't act like
a fucking pervert anymore.

227
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:11,060
Even white dudes can't
get away with that shit.

228
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,231
Most of the time.

229
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,200
People can see you,
and hear you, and...

230
00:12:15,268 --> 00:12:18,705
And smell you.
Sorry, pregnancy nose.

231
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:20,965
No. Ah.

232
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,872
Ground rules, Hyman.

233
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:25,741
Okay, boys, let's get
back on mission, shall we?

234
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:28,508
We need you to travel some
people to Umber's house.

235
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:29,774
You think you can do it?

236
00:12:29,882 --> 00:12:32,579
You guys need me? Whoa.

237
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:35,787
My traveling's a little rusty, but
I'll do whatever you guys need.

238
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:37,856
Yeah, about that.

239
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,965
You wouldn't know it from how
stoic I was, but it was the worst pain

240
00:12:48,067 --> 00:12:49,797
anyone has ever felt.

241
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:52,064
Wow, that's neat. Here's
the address to Umber's.

242
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:53,401
Are you sure you can do this?

243
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:55,305
Buddy, I know my onions.

244
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:56,569
That means yes?

245
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,908
That must mean yes.

246
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,880
Oh.

247
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:03,945
Hey. Hi.

248
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,819
Remind me, you are...

249
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:07,919
Fen.

250
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:09,254
Fen.

251
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:10,656
Eliot's wife?

252
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,091
Fillory girl.

253
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,593
Of course, Fillory girl.

254
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:16,892
You're the one who loves forks.

255
00:13:18,264 --> 00:13:19,264
What's got you grummy?

256
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:20,365
I'm fine.

257
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,764
As a seasoned viewer of people,

258
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:26,606
I think you're upset
because their plan is zany,

259
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:28,417
and you know if you
speak up, they won't listen.

260
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:33,175
What? No, their
plan is... is great.

261
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,611
And they do listen to me.

262
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:36,809
Didn't Eliot say
you were a hayseed

263
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:39,181
from a backwards,
prolapsed asshole of a planet?

264
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,318
Or were... You weren't...
Were you not there?

265
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,816
Okay, outsider
to outsider. Yeah?

266
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:49,361
Doesn't this feel like
the part in the story

267
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:52,489
where the good
guys are just wrong?

268
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,464
Hearts in the right place,

269
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:55,678
but they haven't
learned the lesson

270
00:13:55,702 --> 00:13:57,466
of this little morality
play they're in yet,

271
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:59,199
so they have this crazy plan

272
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:01,672
that makes them almost
as bad as the villain.

273
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:03,140
Oh.

274
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,404
Or maybe it's just me.

275
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,643
I did it.

276
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,313
Ha-ha!

277
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,355
I really did it.

278
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,233
We'll ring you when
we're ready to travel back.

279
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:20,123
I'm not coming with you inside?

280
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:21,889
We're all full up
on perverts, here.

281
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:23,228
Oh.

282
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:25,864
Oh, that's... That's fine.

283
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,263
I've got other stuff to do.

284
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:29,368
I'm...

285
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:31,199
Maybe I'll go google myself.

286
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,830
You know what?
Knock yourself out.

287
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:36,441
Bye.

288
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,283
I'm sorry, the master of the
house isn't available right now.

289
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:46,819
Please return another time.

290
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,980
Wait, why does he look
like Umber but boring?

291
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:52,048
That's his human form, for
blending in with Canadians.

292
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:53,626
Must be another emanation.

293
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:57,891
He's a ghost butler! Who
ya gonna call? That guy!

294
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,465
We spoke to the horny
version of you in Fillory,

295
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,001
he sent us here to
get a thing. Can we?

296
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:05,296
In the beginning,
there was nothing.

297
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:09,906
Until a tigress, blind in one
eye, came to a lonely shore.

298
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,273
The tigress looked
upon this raw world and...

299
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,481
And what?

300
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:19,619
I'm sorry, the master of
the house isn't available.

301
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:22,450
I think ghost butler is broken.

302
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:26,287
Or it's a test. Solve the
puzzle, get in the door.

303
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:29,294
How could it be a test? He's
just spouting random nonsense.

304
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,195
Oh, it's not random.
It's Fillorian scripture.

305
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:36,730
The birth of Ember and Umber.
You guys haven't heard this story?

306
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:39,272
What happens next?

307
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:46,312
Well, the Tigress, she waded
into the ocean and drowned herself.

308
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:49,246
And as her body disappeared
beneath the waves,

309
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,648
two shells washed ashore.

310
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:57,388
And from those shells came
Ember, and then his shadow, Umber.

311
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,850
Welcome.

312
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:13,405
Ow.

313
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:16,305
God, shut up.

314
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,434
Julia.

315
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,174
I'm fine. I'm just...

316
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,476
Just a little bit of
aftershock. That's all.

317
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:33,892
Hyman.

318
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,828
Penny, did you know they
sell pre-sliced bread now?

319
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:41,830
That's the greatest invention
since... I don't even know what.

320
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:44,499
Your parents, were
they magicians?

321
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,699
No. Uh, Dad was a
door-to-door snake salesman.

322
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:49,139
Snake oil?

323
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:53,906
No. And my mom worked at a
brothel, you know, just mopping.

324
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:55,909
Okay, did she, um...

325
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:00,210
Did she suffer from
any mental problems?

326
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,546
Psychic stuff from
being pregnant with you?

327
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:05,454
Oh, no, nothing like that.

328
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,494
After the lobotomy,
she mostly just

329
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:11,998
sat on the porch and
sucked at bits of hay.

330
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:16,495
Other than that, she
was the perfect mother.

331
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:18,836
Okay, come on. Uh, I need
your help with something.

332
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:20,936
Put the sandwich down.

333
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:25,902
You want to find the Couple?

334
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,742
They're a myth. Like the
Boogeyman, or Santa Claus.

335
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:32,011
Uh... Santa is very real.

336
00:17:32,084 --> 00:17:33,677
And so are the Couple.

337
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,747
We met one of them.

338
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:41,217
The only other person that I know
who believes they're real is Marina.

339
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:45,163
The last time we saw her, we
screwed her over, moved the moon,

340
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,511
stopped the Harmonic
Convergence,

341
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,968
which she was going to use for
some heist-of-the-century type of deal.

342
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,038
I didn't say that
she'll help you.

343
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:54,633
I just said she's the
only one who can.

344
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,414
Pretty by-the-numbers
defensive wards.

345
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,413
Marina's not a
by-the-numbers kind of girl.

346
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,256
You guys!

347
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,059
Come here. Uh...

348
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,259
Kady, I just wanted to tell you

349
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:27,932
that I am so sorry for all of
the times that I've hurt you.

350
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:31,303
Come inside for cookies?

351
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,540
What the fuck was that?

352
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,122
I'm still learning how to bake,

353
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:47,717
so no judging.

354
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:49,488
Go ahead.

355
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:51,425
They're not poisoned.

356
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,432
But they might be?

357
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:56,161
Marina, why are you...

358
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:58,328
Nice? Mmm-hmm.

359
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:00,770
This may surprise you...

360
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,275
but I made some bad
choices in the past,

361
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,407
and I needed to fix that.

362
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:08,038
So I went to a
trance healer. Um...

363
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,143
She put a block on all
the parts of my personality

364
00:19:11,217 --> 00:19:14,881
that made aggressive but
ultimately self-destructive choices.

365
00:19:15,788 --> 00:19:17,120
This feels like a scam.

366
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:20,193
It's a weird scam.

367
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:23,041
I'm not asking you for anything.

368
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:25,296
And you came to me.

369
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,960
Seems like you need something?

370
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:32,869
We're looking for the Couple.

371
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:40,174
Well, this has been great, but I
actually have to get ready for church.

372
00:19:40,246 --> 00:19:42,078
You know who they are.

373
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,308
I know that going after them

374
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:46,716
is the very definition of
an old Marina decision.

375
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,914
Look, I want to
help you. I do, really.

376
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,720
If it was anything else.

377
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:58,526
But they have something we
need to stop the end of everything.

378
00:19:58,931 --> 00:19:59,931
The World Seed.

379
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:04,200
The most valuable object
in the multiverse, people say.

380
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,704
Which is why I
wanted to steal it,

381
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,405
until you stopped the
Harmonic Convergence.

382
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:13,474
Wait, that was your
heist of the century?

383
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,538
So you could help us steal it.

384
00:20:15,648 --> 00:20:18,914
No. No, no, no. I... I don't
do things like that anymore.

385
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,889
Stealing from the Couple,
people will get hurt.

386
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:25,424
Way more people will
get hurt if you don't help us.

387
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:26,856
Alice...

388
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:29,521
friends don't make friends
grapple with the trolley problem.

389
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:33,123
They cut off my fingers.
There's no gray area here.

390
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:41,032
They're hiding the Seed
inside a hotel called The Nave.

391
00:20:42,274 --> 00:20:43,572
I've been there.

392
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:44,974
They only let in Magicians.

393
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,277
Everything about it is secret.

394
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:50,682
Has a vault that's the most
secure place on the planet.

395
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,842
But you had a plan to break in.

396
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:53,918
I had partners.

397
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:56,251
We spent months
constructing a map

398
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:58,518
of every inch of that
hotel and its defenses.

399
00:20:58,591 --> 00:20:59,786
We called it our Heist Book.

400
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,460
The problem is,
things got really crazy

401
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:06,157
and I don't actually know
where the book ended up.

402
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:12,564
But I know someone who might.

403
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,602
Hey, buddy! Been a minute.

404
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:19,770
Need some ice chips or
something? Oh, Christ. No. Go away!

405
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:22,075
Is that Gavin from the
Library? He doesn't...

406
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:23,980
I don't work for the
sodding Library anymore!

407
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,813
Yeah. What happened to you?

408
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:27,045
She didn't tell you?

409
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,716
Marina hired me and a few other
poor bastards to rob the Couple.

410
00:21:32,091 --> 00:21:34,287
She didn't tell us that
the plan was suicidal

411
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,953
without the Harmonic
Convergence.

412
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:37,723
Marina sent us in anyway.

413
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:40,733
One guy was killed.
Horribly, I might add.

414
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,761
I was lucky. But now I'm stuck
here, a bag of shattered bones,

415
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:48,103
can't travel, with
fucking Daryl over there

416
00:21:48,174 --> 00:21:50,302
talking my fucking ear
off all day and night.

417
00:21:50,376 --> 00:21:54,211
And so help me God, if you wake
him up, I will kill all of your mothers.

418
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,941
Marina beat you to that one.

419
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:57,643
Then why are you
working with her?

420
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:01,109
Um, Marina, maybe
you should step outside.

421
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:02,187
Mmm.

422
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,954
We're not fans of
Marina or the Couple.

423
00:22:09,028 --> 00:22:10,291
But we need the World Seed,

424
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:11,807
so if you could just
give us the Heist Book,

425
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,766
we can... I would
sooner shit my cast.

426
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:17,031
Well, it looks like that's gonna
happen either way, so why not help us?

427
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:19,037
Because that would
mean helping Marina.

428
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:20,800
And if you think
I'm gonna do that,

429
00:22:20,873 --> 00:22:23,342
then you have a few roos
loose in the top paddock, love.

430
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:27,540
So either find a way to scratch
my ass or get the hell out.

431
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,040
That's why you did the
spell to make yourself good.

432
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,830
Because you sent them
on a suicide mission.

433
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:35,116
I thought maybe
they'd get lucky.

434
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,382
Well, they really didn't.

435
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:37,979
We need that Heist Book.

436
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:40,390
How did you convince Gavin
to help you in the first place?

437
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:43,362
I had leverage.

438
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:44,795
Well, then use it, now.

439
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,162
That would be deeply unethical.

440
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:51,398
I think I'm gonna go
get him a smoothie.

441
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,539
If he won't help
us, we're stuck.

442
00:22:56,609 --> 00:23:00,205
We can't be stuck. We need
the book. We need Marina.

443
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:04,009
Or we need to be Marina.

444
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,019
Oh, God.

445
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:10,550
Look, we understand.
You don't want to help us.

446
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:14,387
We can't make you. But we
can take down your wards.

447
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,055
You're a Traveler.

448
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:19,063
Without mental wards,
you'll hear people's thoughts.

449
00:23:19,164 --> 00:23:22,293
All day, all night. Even
while they're sleeping.

450
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:25,028
If you do that while the moon
is borked, my head will be, too.

451
00:23:25,371 --> 00:23:28,102
I recently had several fingers
amputated and reattached.

452
00:23:28,207 --> 00:23:30,047
I'd be more concerned
about that if I were you.

453
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:36,538
I underestimated you, book
tart. You're worse than Marina.

454
00:23:37,116 --> 00:23:40,280
No. Just desperate.

455
00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:48,290
Bugger you all to hell, stop.

456
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:49,885
The Heist Book?

457
00:23:49,962 --> 00:23:51,842
I can't give it to you,
because I don't have it.

458
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:52,931
Who does?

459
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:55,558
Anna. She took it after
things went pear-shaped.

460
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:56,634
Who is Anna?

461
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:58,469
Ask her.

462
00:24:03,042 --> 00:24:05,807
Well, now we have
a real problem.

463
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:13,784
Is that Chinese and ice cream?

464
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:16,682
You could smell that?

465
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,917
I have a new superpower.
So, what'd you get?

466
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:23,457
Well, I... I didn't know
what you were craving,

467
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:26,089
so, everything. Also...

468
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:30,866
The Circumstances control panel?

469
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,213
Did you steal that from the lab?

470
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:33,398
Hyman helped.

471
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:36,807
We figured if the Couple is
going to use the World Seed,

472
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:40,642
they need clean magic. So,
without this, they are stuck.

473
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:42,238
Hence, hiding it here.

474
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,112
If it were going to
be here anyway,

475
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:47,153
I figured Lipson could
come by, do the treatments,

476
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:49,687
run some scans, two birds.

477
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,348
Good, but Lipson
said the baby was fine.

478
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:53,324
She said she needed
to do more tests.

479
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:55,519
She said it might be dangerous.

480
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:57,095
And you said you'd have my back,

481
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,721
and instead you're
trapping me here?

482
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,959
She has to reapply the
treatments every couple hours.

483
00:25:01,033 --> 00:25:03,025
I'm just looking out
for you and the baby.

484
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,102
I mean, somebody has to.

485
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:07,535
Oh, shit.

486
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,976
Sorry, I'll be quiet. Go on.

487
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:14,011
You can't eavesdrop
on people's shit like that.

488
00:25:14,113 --> 00:25:15,113
But...

489
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,012
Yeah, Hyman, you
have a body now.

490
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:18,716
You really need to
understand boundaries.

491
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:22,179
So do you. Julia, wait.

492
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:31,652
I stumbled upon this place last time
when I was looking for the bathroom.

493
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,222
This is where he
keeps all of his

494
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:35,926
pocket worlds.

495
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:40,738
What the fuck? I swear, this
place was full of them last time.

496
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:42,705
Well, where the
shit did they go?

497
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:43,775
Oh.

498
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,708
The Chankly Bore. Aw.

499
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:48,504
I grew up playing Queen of
the Hump on hills just like this.

500
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,549
If it isn't the Ark,
I don't give a shit.

501
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,707
Okay.

502
00:25:52,785 --> 00:25:54,083
Ghost butler?

503
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:55,711
Uh, I don't think
it works like that.

504
00:25:55,788 --> 00:25:57,313
You can't just summon him.

505
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,789
He's not our butler.

506
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:00,052
Oh!

507
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,159
Hi.

508
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,320
Greetings. How may I assist you?

509
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,675
We're looking
for a pocket world.

510
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,426
The master of the
house is not available.

511
00:26:06,532 --> 00:26:08,057
We know.

512
00:26:08,167 --> 00:26:11,262
And so, all pocket worlds have
been removed for security purposes.

513
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:15,364
It's okay. Umber sent us to
get it. He told us it'd be here.

514
00:26:15,441 --> 00:26:17,273
Which world did he
send you to retrieve?

515
00:26:17,376 --> 00:26:19,572
It's called the Ark.

516
00:26:21,346 --> 00:26:22,346
Very well.

517
00:26:25,517 --> 00:26:27,611
If Umber sent you on this task,

518
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:30,211
you should be able
to identify the true Ark.

519
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:32,884
But if you choose poorly...

520
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:37,526
Ooh. Uh, we age really fast
and then we all turn to dust

521
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:38,894
just like in <i>The Last Crusade?</i>

522
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:40,899
Indeed! This security precaution

523
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:42,730
is inspired by my master's love...
- Mmm.

524
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:44,702
For <i>Indiana Jones

For copyright purposes, the
consequences of an incorrect choice

526
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:50,436
has been changed to
something more explosive.

527
00:26:51,477 --> 00:26:53,571
Choose... Wisely, yeah.

528
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:54,840
We get it.

529
00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:00,849
All right, Fen. You're the
Fillory expert. Have at it.

530
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:10,188
Any day now.

531
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:16,435
You know what?
Figure it out yourself.

532
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:27,511
You need to let me do
the talking. This is sensitive.

533
00:27:27,613 --> 00:27:30,606
How'd you fuck over Anna, huh?
She lose a limb or something?

534
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:32,150
Well, I definitely fucked her.

535
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:33,879
Wait, she's your... Anna!

536
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,580
Marina.

537
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:39,687
I want nothing to do with you.
- Anna, please.

538
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:42,191
It's an emergency.

539
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:48,024
It wasn't just one lie.

540
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:50,830
It was how one led to
another and another,

541
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:53,134
and now I don't know
if any of it was real.

542
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:55,900
Did you know that she was
from a different timeline?

543
00:27:56,642 --> 00:27:59,510
'Cause I didn't. And then
you tried to rob the Couple.

544
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:02,604
Our friend died because of you.

545
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:06,083
I know. I was a terrible person.

546
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:09,849
I was a greedy,
self-centered sociopath.

547
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:11,550
And when you left
me, I deserved it.

548
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:14,315
But I'm making amends now.

549
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,704
I've done a bunch
of things on your list.

550
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:17,872
I got the trance healing done.

551
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:21,060
But yet here you are,
asking for the Heist Book.

552
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,499
Uh... Wait, no,
that's just for us.

553
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:25,162
Or maybe this is
just another lie...

554
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:28,730
and you aren't better,
you aren't different at all.

555
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:32,341
Look, trust me,
she is very different.

556
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:34,175
I mean, she baked us cookies.

557
00:28:34,513 --> 00:28:36,243
Really terrible cookies.

558
00:28:36,748 --> 00:28:38,944
I don't trust you, okay?
You showed up with her.

559
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:41,518
Just give us the
book, and we'll go.

560
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:44,250
We'll never pull her into
our life of crime ever again.

561
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:46,036
Marina doesn't have
to be involved anymore.

562
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:51,260
But I do.

563
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:55,133
I'm sorry, I
literally can't lie.

564
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:59,399
This isn't simple,
like robbing a bank.

565
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:00,870
You can't do it without me.

566
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:03,670
And yes, I promised
I would help you.

567
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,107
At least you're honest.

568
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,410
I'm gonna take
the spell off Marina.

569
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:15,578
What?

570
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:17,849
The Healer would have
used a synaptic blocker.

571
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,051
Easy to remove, even
under weird circumstances.

572
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,321
You want to bring
back the bad Marina?

573
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:26,796
To get the book, we need her to tell Anna
that she's not gonna help with the heist.

574
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:27,922
We need her to lie.

575
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,732
You're the one who said
that we should be like Marina.

576
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:33,395
This time we need
the real Marina.

577
00:29:34,573 --> 00:29:36,493
Yeah, I think she
needs a minute.

578
00:29:38,977 --> 00:29:39,977
What are you doing?

579
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:41,603
Word As Bond spell.

580
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,874
It's a magically-binding
contract that guarantees

581
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:45,269
that you will get
the book for us.

582
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:47,809
And when you help us with
the heist, you won't fuck us over.

583
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,285
You don't need that.

584
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:51,183
I mean, with this
spell I'm under,

585
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,589
I couldn't betray you
even if I wanted to.

586
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,061
Better safe than sorry.

587
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:05,300
Julia? Are you here?

588
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:11,075
What are you doing?

589
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,372
Just stretching.

590
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:17,648
You're trying to put yourself
into stasis. The hell, man?

591
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:21,186
To be honest, I haven't really
enjoyed this episode of my life.

592
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,986
What is so great about
having a body, anyway?

593
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:25,648
You're hungry all the time.

594
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:27,919
Everything you
do makes you sore.

595
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:30,929
You're pooping constantly.

596
00:30:31,296 --> 00:30:34,164
That hasn't been my experience,

597
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:39,170
but your body's been in a bench
for a century, man. Give it a minute.

598
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:44,005
And when dramatic things are happening
to your friends, you can't even watch.

599
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:48,108
This is about me and Julia?

600
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,014
You're pissed because
you can't listen in

601
00:30:51,116 --> 00:30:53,881
on everyone's
personal conversations?

602
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:56,780
It's none of your business.

603
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,256
But it is! I put
you two together.

604
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:02,556
I shipped you before you
even shipped yourselves.

605
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:05,594
Before, I was a
part of everything.

606
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:12,570
And now, I am a, uh, minor
character in my own story. God.

607
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:19,877
Well, that's...

608
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:23,174
That's the trade-off.

609
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:27,049
You don't get to spy on
people's intimate moments.

610
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:29,245
You get to live your own.

611
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:31,220
And that's supposed
to be better?

612
00:31:33,058 --> 00:31:35,254
If people wanted to talk to me,

613
00:31:35,761 --> 00:31:37,801
you think I would have
done this in the first place?

614
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:41,863
So, the spying on
the showers was...

615
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:43,901
Loneliness.

616
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:47,566
And horniness.

617
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,472
You're never gonna make a
connection by hiding, Hyman.

618
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,478
You gotta put
yourself out there,

619
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,777
just be honest with people.

620
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:00,645
It may take a minute,

621
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,085
but you'll find someone
who can stand you.

622
00:32:05,023 --> 00:32:07,618
Ah... Are you doing that thing
where you're giving me advice,

623
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:08,726
but it's just for you?

624
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:10,786
No, I'm trying to...

625
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:14,096
Oh, God damn it.

626
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:17,432
I gotta find Julia.

627
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:23,238
While I'm gone, promise me
you're not going to stasis yourself.

628
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:25,770
Well...

629
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:27,773
Give me the locket.

630
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:35,516
Talk to somebody.
Have a conversation.

631
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:56,935
Hello? Is someone there?

632
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:02,440
Ah!

633
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:04,005
Miss Wicker.

634
00:33:05,116 --> 00:33:06,709
I have been looking for you.

635
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:11,652
Yes. It's come to this.

636
00:33:18,263 --> 00:33:20,994
Sir Effingham. What are
you doing with that trash can?

637
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:26,271
Some hapless fellow left a
sandwich of roast beef in there,

638
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:28,307
and as I could not
get to market today...

639
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:30,842
Oh! Oh, my heavens.

640
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:34,038
You have embraced
the blessing of your sex.

641
00:33:34,145 --> 00:33:36,808
But surely you have
misplaced your wedding band?

642
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:39,546
You are widowed then?

643
00:33:39,718 --> 00:33:41,380
No. Oh, you poor dear,

644
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:43,478
you are carrying a bastard.

645
00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:44,818
Definitely talking to one.

646
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:47,223
Look, I thought you
chose Todd for this quest?

647
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:50,853
I fear he is not the intrepid
hero I once thought him to be.

648
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:52,222
You don't say.

649
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:56,028
Which is why, in my
gravest hour of need,

650
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:59,036
I have come to
vouchsafe you a quest.

651
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:00,982
Look, if this has
to do with Fillory...

652
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:04,408
For my vision of Fillory's
demise has grown clearer!

653
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:08,071
I now see those who would
bring the apocalypse to Fillory

654
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,239
have visited many times before.

655
00:34:10,348 --> 00:34:13,614
They enter from a distant
realm through a tree.

656
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:16,786
Like, a portal tree? Indeed.

657
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,187
These fiends plan to thieve away

658
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:22,853
every soul in the land
before they destroy it outright.

659
00:34:22,928 --> 00:34:23,952
Huh.

660
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:27,891
How exactly do they do that?

661
00:34:27,966 --> 00:34:30,162
My vision is hazy.

662
00:34:30,235 --> 00:34:34,172
But I do know that they will
turn back the clock on Fillory,

663
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,333
resulting in ruin!

664
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:37,432
Um...

665
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:39,769
Do these fiends...

666
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:43,645
Do they succeed in stealing the
people and building a new world for them?

667
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,512
That much I do
not know because...

668
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:48,952
Wait, I made no
mention of a new world.

669
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,823
It is you!

670
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,187
It's for Fillory's own good.

671
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:56,999
The dead will rise. This is the
only way that we can save everyone.

672
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:02,124
Oh, hogwash. What dark forces
have corrupted your fair mind?

673
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:03,292
You have.

674
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:05,379
We wouldn't be on this
quest if you hadn't told me

675
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:06,447
about it in the first place.

676
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:09,373
Are you now blaming
me for your own villainy?

677
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:14,576
Oh, the ways of the sow are
nastier than I thought possible.

678
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:19,448
But know this, the death of
Fillory cannot come without a cost.

679
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:20,951
What do you mean?

680
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:25,655
Those who would destroy
her will lose the ones they love.

681
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:26,781
Hmm.

682
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,036
So, we're sorry

683
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:47,670
for treating you like the friend
who only gets invited to trivia night.

684
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:50,978
You know I don't
know what that means.

685
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:52,783
Yeah.

686
00:35:56,855 --> 00:35:58,949
Will you please help
us choose a globe?

687
00:35:59,024 --> 00:36:00,617
Margo is chomping at the bit

688
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:02,854
and Josh is holding her
off for as long as he can.

689
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:05,488
I thought I could
talk myself into this.

690
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:09,429
But I just keep thinking,
if this was Earth,

691
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:13,802
you would try a lot harder
to find some other way.

692
00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:15,773
Yeah, probably.

693
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:18,435
So maybe it's my job
to represent Fillory.

694
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:22,078
But not just the
people, the place.

695
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,709
The history.

696
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:25,908
The things we
can't take with us.

697
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:31,050
You want my
permission to destroy it.

698
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:34,683
I can't give that to you.

699
00:36:34,793 --> 00:36:37,558
Well, if you have any
other ideas, we are all ears.

700
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,255
Do you?

701
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:41,231
No.

702
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:49,932
Was that supposed to do that?

703
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:54,576
Fillorians write down their
prayers to Umber and burn them.

704
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,671
This must be where they show up.

705
00:36:57,015 --> 00:36:59,177
So they still pray to him,
even though he's dead?

706
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,741
I know what you're thinking.

707
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:05,014
It's just like the people of
Fillory to do something so stupid.

708
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:07,218
No. I was thinking

709
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:12,888
it's taken me a really
long time to figure out

710
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:16,526
that you can still love
something, even after it's gone.

711
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,230
Even if you helped kill it?

712
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:27,372
Okay, Fen, it's time for
a come-to-Umber talk.

713
00:37:27,879 --> 00:37:31,043
You don't want to be a
sidekick? You want to have a say?

714
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:33,311
This is what that feels like.

715
00:37:33,418 --> 00:37:35,216
I'm not asking for
your permission.

716
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:37,149
Some part of Fillory has to die,

717
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,156
and you're the one
who has to choose.

718
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,590
Is it going to be the
rocks and the dirt,

719
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:43,958
or is it gonna be the
people and the traditions

720
00:37:44,062 --> 00:37:46,327
and all of the things that
you can take with you?

721
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:48,565
I got it!

722
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:49,726
Oh, no.

723
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:52,396
Ah, shit. I don't got it!

724
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:55,472
Aah!

725
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:12,949
Oh! Oh!

726
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:15,788
It didn't explode!
I... I did it!

727
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:19,154
I chose wisely! I'm wise!

728
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:25,102
All the people of Fillory are
going to fit into a seahorse?

729
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,194
Hmm?

730
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,966
How'd you know that was the one?

731
00:38:28,173 --> 00:38:31,507
Because that's how Ember and
Umber first brought people to Fillory.

732
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:35,011
They chartered the great
seahorse to carry us in his pouch.

733
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:36,206
Oh.

734
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,148
What?

735
00:38:38,683 --> 00:38:40,276
How'd people get to Earth?

736
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:41,552
Um...

737
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,918
Mmm-hmm. The same. The same.

738
00:38:46,224 --> 00:38:49,490
And I promise I won't have anything
to do with robbing the Couple.

739
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:53,362
If you give the book to Kady
and Alice, I'll never see it again.

740
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:57,025
Watching evil Marina
pretend to be good is...

741
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:00,028
I feel like shit.

742
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:03,168
Yeah, I feel like shit, too.

743
00:39:10,315 --> 00:39:11,315
Here.

744
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:13,783
I'm glad to be rid of it.
- Is that...

745
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:17,152
The Heist Book? I know
it doesn't look like much.

746
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:18,546
Thank you.

747
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:20,591
Are you guys...

748
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:24,220
We have a lot of
work to do, on us.

749
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:27,532
But we're going to
try. Now that I'm better.

750
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:32,196
Great. Okay. So, I
guess we're done here.

751
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:35,271
And, um, we won't
bother you anymore.

752
00:39:36,241 --> 00:39:37,241
Yeah.

753
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:43,847
Hey.

754
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:45,815
I've been looking for you.

755
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:47,746
Saw the Pig Man again.

756
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:53,220
Turns out, you know that
apocalypse I've been trying to stop?

757
00:39:53,992 --> 00:39:55,153
We cause it.

758
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:58,060
If the prophecy says
that Fillory is destroyed,

759
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:00,563
that means we
succeed, right? And...

760
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:04,029
Good news? JULIA: Yeah.

761
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,162
Good news.

762
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:09,105
Look, about earlier,
I need to tell you...

763
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:11,005
Look, I know. I
was irresponsible.

764
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,873
Look, I should just
accept the fact that

765
00:40:12,944 --> 00:40:16,472
any control I had over
my life is now gone,

766
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:19,312
and I am a walking
incubator. Julia.

767
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,628
It's just terrifying, you know?

768
00:40:20,652 --> 00:40:24,089
What if Lipson does the
tests and it's bad news?

769
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:26,054
You know, right now
everything is good.

770
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:28,184
And the thought of
losing any of that is just...

771
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,457
Julia, it's not the baby
I'm freaking out about.

772
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:38,261
Look, I told you about how my
dad left. But what I didn't tell you,

773
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:42,601
what I haven't told anyone is,

774
00:40:42,674 --> 00:40:48,045
around that time, my mom
started having episodes.

775
00:40:51,049 --> 00:40:54,451
Getting disoriented, hearing
shit that wasn't there. Um...

776
00:40:56,254 --> 00:40:58,155
Doctors thought
it was the stress,

777
00:40:58,256 --> 00:41:00,157
from my dad
bailing on us, but...

778
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:01,954
You think it's because of you.

779
00:41:06,264 --> 00:41:08,927
What's happening to you

780
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:12,804
looks just like what
happened to my mom.

781
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,938
And the episodes didn't
stop when I was born.

782
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:18,404
They got worse.

783
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:24,112
When she burned
down our apartment

784
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:27,944
was the first time I got
thrown into foster care.

785
00:41:28,286 --> 00:41:32,690
She'd fight to get me back,
and then she'd get sick again.

786
00:41:34,726 --> 00:41:37,491
Eventually the state
took me in for good.

787
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,792
And I was scared,

788
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,834
but I was more scared of my mom.

789
00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:50,332
I fucked her up for life.

790
00:41:54,312 --> 00:41:55,312
I'm so sorry.

791
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,316
I don't want what happened
to her to happen to you.

792
00:41:59,317 --> 00:42:01,286
Okay. I get it.

793
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:04,148
I'll do it.

794
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:07,348
The scans, the treatments.

795
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:10,485
But you have to know, it won't be
like what happened to your mom.

796
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:12,462
We know about magic.

797
00:42:13,398 --> 00:42:15,333
We have ways to deal with it.

798
00:42:17,335 --> 00:42:18,997
And I won't put you in a cage.

799
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,514
What the hell, man?

800
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:34,182
I tried to talk to him and
he punched me in the face!

801
00:42:34,252 --> 00:42:35,252
Who?

802
00:42:36,087 --> 00:42:37,087
Oh. Mmm-mmm.

803
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:42,550
I warned you not to cross me.

804
00:42:42,627 --> 00:42:43,856
How the hell'd you get out?

805
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:46,693
Let this be my last
lesson to you as Dean.

806
00:42:47,198 --> 00:42:50,896
Don't make too many enemies.
They might find each other.

807
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:52,368
The Couple.

808
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:57,703
Oh, I can't let you take
that panel out of here.

809
00:42:58,876 --> 00:43:00,572
This is some fate
of the world shit.

810
00:43:00,645 --> 00:43:03,513
Not my world. Not my problem.

811
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:05,609
Then I guess I'm your problem.

812
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:08,978
Dean Fogg? What's going on?

813
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:13,380
Huh. This just got
very, very interesting.

814
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:16,759
Are you stupid enough
to try and stop me?

815
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,712
What just happened?

816
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,544
The Couple just got
the last thing they need.

817
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,175
They have the Seed,
the page and the panel.

818
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:43,417
We gotta tell the others. They
need to steal that Seed now.
