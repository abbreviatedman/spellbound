1
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:08,779
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,579
I see blood on the walls.

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,916
I hear its voice.

4
00:00:11,917 --> 00:00:13,280
It wants out.

5
00:00:13,285 --> 00:00:14,419
Have you tried letting it out?

6
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,519
Charlton?

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,119
I once was possessed by the Monster too.

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,939
When all the scary creatures
were pulled out,

9
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,019
I held on tight as I could
in your happy place.

10
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,129
I found this in Q's stuff at Brakebills.

11
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,397
Professor?

12
00:00:26,398 --> 00:00:28,599
I mean... Dean Adiyodi?

13
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,067
Yeah, come in.

14
00:00:30,068 --> 00:00:31,669
What did you do with Fogg 17?

15
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,737
I call that one Psycho Fogg.

16
00:00:33,738 --> 00:00:36,006
Put him in the clean room.
He can't cast there, so.

17
00:00:36,007 --> 00:00:37,241
I can't do what I need to do

18
00:00:37,242 --> 00:00:39,376
if I'm worried about how
it's gonna affect you.

19
00:00:39,377 --> 00:00:40,778
I think we need to be done.

20
00:00:40,779 --> 00:00:42,279
I'm interviewing for the botany job.

21
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,681
Hamish Bax.

22
00:00:43,682 --> 00:00:46,359
If I'm right, this should
adjust circumstances

23
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,410
in the entire greenhouse,

24
00:00:47,419 --> 00:00:49,219
allowing us to cast.

25
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,249
You risked everything for us.

26
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,658
The least we can do is
to show you the truth.

27
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,139
You can't outrun me!

28
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,579
Six children taken. It's horrific.

29
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,500
- The Takers are swarming.
- It's my fault.

30
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,089
They're swarming because Seb
summoned them with a spell

31
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,270
using the gold I gave him.

32
00:01:40,271 --> 00:01:42,674
I didn't know what he
was gonna do with it.

33
00:01:42,675 --> 00:01:45,919
The Takers... that's
how he stays in power.

34
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,939
He summons them

35
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,809
- and only he can fight them.
- Jesus.

36
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:51,189
I go away to my nephew's bar
mitzvah for one weekend

37
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:52,482
and everything gets fercockt.

38
00:01:52,483 --> 00:01:53,489
What are we going to do?

39
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,610
We gotta kill the Dark King.

40
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,359
What? We're all thinking it.

41
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,639
Eli's Torah portion was all
about the sanctity of life,

42
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,260
and I found it very moving.

43
00:02:03,261 --> 00:02:07,829
So, can't we, I don't know,
peacefully overthrow him?

44
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,019
No, we can't.

45
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,619
He's got a Centurion army.
I should know. I'm one of 'em.

46
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,389
Also 300 years of propaganda

47
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,607
convincing everyone they need him.

48
00:02:15,608 --> 00:02:17,719
Also-also, 300 years?

49
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,845
We're talking a powerful,
immortal magician?

50
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,099
Doubt you can just walk
up and stab the guy.

51
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,840
I've been researching.

52
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,019
The Dark King survived seven
assassination attempts

53
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,119
since he took our thrones.

54
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,179
Must be big magic keeping him alive.

55
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,279
We have to figure out what it is.

56
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,423
Find out his weakness.

57
00:02:33,424 --> 00:02:34,719
You're on board with this too?

58
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,139
I mean, I'm here to stop
an apocalypse that happens

59
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,859
'cause an evil force invades
from a distant realm.

60
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,329
That sounds like the Takers.

61
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,940
Then it's settled.
We kill the Dark King,

62
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,069
stop the Takers from pouring in,

63
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,738
stop the apocalypse. Who's in?

64
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:49,199
Just a couple of Q's, like

65
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,948
how are we gonna get close
enough to the Dark King

66
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:52,639
to learn his weakness
and assassinate him?

67
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,639
We're a cook, a maid, a army grunt,

68
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,359
a Julia, and a...

69
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,409
Counselor/confidante.

70
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,439
You gotta admit, El,
you're perfectly placed.

71
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,120
Plus, he's always dismissing his
guards when you come around.

72
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,620
Why does me liking somebody
always end up with them dying?

73
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,393
You should tell your friends, Eliot.

74
00:03:10,394 --> 00:03:12,299
That I don't want to save Fillory

75
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,589
because I caught feelings?

76
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,579
I'm saying they should know how you feel

77
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,736
before they try to make you
do something you regret.

78
00:03:17,737 --> 00:03:20,349
No, I'll just look selfish, Charlton.

79
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,239
And I'll still end up having to do it.

80
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,199
- Talking to somebody?
- Um...

81
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,569
myself and psyching myself up.

82
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,460
Fillory needs the Dark King dead

83
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,583
and I am the obvious inside man.

84
00:03:31,584 --> 00:03:32,679
You sound weird.

85
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,252
- You sound weird.
- Okay.

86
00:03:34,253 --> 00:03:35,819
It's that Eliot.

87
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:38,619
Uh, look, I know I'm just the guy

88
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,559
who has to live inside your
tragic remembrances and all

89
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,960
but I truly don't understand
why you won't at least tell her.

90
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,860
Margo. Look...

91
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,640
I'm not sure I can go through with this.

92
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,001
El, you have a crush on a
boy who's bad for you.

93
00:03:51,002 --> 00:03:52,069
Happens to all of us,

94
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,899
but how do we get crushes
out of our system?

95
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,579
Lots of drinking, pining,

96
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,109
some detailed sex fantasies.

97
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,060
No. We bang them out.

98
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,239
Okay, that's great,

99
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,315
except for the part where now
I have to murder the guy

100
00:04:04,316 --> 00:04:06,009
I just hypothetically slept with,

101
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,499
which is a thing that shouldn't
really happen to a person

102
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,679
more than once.

103
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,819
El,

104
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,199
Fillory does need this,

105
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,340
so if you can't do it, tell me now.

106
00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:19,189
I know he has to die,
but I don't hate him.

107
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,629
I don't. I can't.

108
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,639
I can't make betraying Seb easier,

109
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,236
but let me help make it simpler.

110
00:04:26,538 --> 00:04:28,672
Say you didn't have
to kill him yourself.

111
00:04:28,673 --> 00:04:31,379
But I'm the one with access.
You just said it.

112
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,042
You're also my best friend.

113
00:04:33,043 --> 00:04:34,519
If you can find his weakness,

114
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,379
I'll find a way you don't
have to be the one to do it,

115
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,339
- I promise.
- How?

116
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,749
I have no fucking idea,

117
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,856
but I'll figure it out for you, okay?

118
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,719
Okay.

119
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,569
- Synced & corrected by<font color="#E83286"> MementMori </font>-
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.addic7ed.com</font> --

120
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:02,073
You took the thing, the panel.
You can't just...

121
00:05:02,074 --> 00:05:04,199
this is mass floricide.

122
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,039
Sorry, I had to bring the panel here

123
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,139
so I could study it.

124
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,520
Sorry, I can't hear you
over my plants dying.

125
00:05:11,226 --> 00:05:13,717
Is this a western-facing window?

126
00:05:13,718 --> 00:05:15,239
And how we have a working classroom

127
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,559
because, you know, school
for magicians, not flowers.

128
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,199
Took the botany job 'cause
you fixed up the greenhouse.

129
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,139
Should've known you'd just
turn around and wreck it.

130
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,599
Here, let me explain how that feels.

131
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,320
Hey!

132
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,633
- Wait, don't touch that.
- Huh.

133
00:05:30,634 --> 00:05:32,329
Thick venation through the leaves,

134
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,199
and look at the asymmetry here.

135
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,672
Wait, do you recognize it?

136
00:05:35,673 --> 00:05:37,579
Don't think it's terrestrial.

137
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,219
You'd need a classification expert

138
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,060
with the right magical tools.

139
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,739
I know a taxonomist that's been around,

140
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,883
you know, the multiverse.

141
00:05:45,884 --> 00:05:48,185
Well, do you think we can
get him to come here?

142
00:05:48,186 --> 00:05:49,849
Don't see why not.

143
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,579
- _
- I'll tell you why not.

144
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,555
Your pal Raylan is on the
dean's "Do Not Admit" list.

145
00:05:54,556 --> 00:05:56,127
You're Acting Dean. Can't you just...

146
00:05:56,128 --> 00:05:57,259
Alice.

147
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:59,429
- He's a botanist.
- Yes!

148
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,759
Who visited a world called Anansia,

149
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,519
home to some highly infectious shit.

150
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,429
He's still alive, isn't he?

151
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,480
Magical phytologists do crazy shit,

152
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:09,259
but Ray's smart.

153
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,839
I doubt he's carrying anything...
well, dangerous.

154
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,799
No offense, but I'm gonna trust
the file with the red stamp.

155
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,399
Look, the only place on Earth right now

156
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,419
with magic stable enough
for Ray to examine it

157
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,299
is in our lab, thanks to me

158
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,480
installing the Circumstances
Control Panel for you.

159
00:06:23,488 --> 00:06:26,039
Don't you think figuring
out the deal with magic

160
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,293
is more important than
translating some page

161
00:06:28,294 --> 00:06:30,879
you found about a plant?

162
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,530
I found it in Quentin's desk.

163
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,703
This thing, it makes no sense

164
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,779
except it was important to Q,

165
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:44,640
so maybe it's important
we figure out what it is.

166
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,449
If we test him thoroughly

167
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,750
and he's clean,

168
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:56,087
he can come.

169
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,539
- Uh... hey, Fen.
- Yeah?

170
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,099
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

171
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,299
Um, lately I've just been
feeling a little bit off.

172
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,259
If we were on Earth,
I'd know what to do, but...

173
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,499
is there, like, a magic
plant or something out here

174
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,499
that I can pee on to find out if I'm...

175
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,179
Pregnant!

176
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,779
Shit.

177
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,139
Sorry. God, I don't know
why I'm crying, just...

178
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,819
babies, ahh!

179
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,355
Um, do you know what you're gonna do?

180
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:34,324
Um, I'm not so sure.

181
00:07:34,325 --> 00:07:37,059
Do you want me to send a bunny to Penny?

182
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,799
Uh, Penny and I are just...

183
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,299
we're sort of in a weird place.

184
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,359
Oh.

185
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,039
Actually, until I've had
some time to process,

186
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,739
I'd really appreciate
if we could keep this

187
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,469
- between you and I, please?
- Of course.

188
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,539
I'm really good with secrets.

189
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,979
I've kept Eliot's fear of
butterflies secret for years.

190
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,709
Until now, shit!

191
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,783
- Sorry, I won't do that with you.
- Pregnant.

192
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,959
Made macarons.

193
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,420
Mango yuzu and matcha. Anyone?

194
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,889
Why?

195
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:10,859
For sustenance? You love them.

196
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,239
Nice try, Hoberman.

197
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,163
We're on mission, so no distractions.

198
00:08:14,164 --> 00:08:16,840
- Out.
- Sorry for interrupting.

199
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,689
Can you believe that guy?

200
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,999
What are you talking about?
You eat matcha everything.

201
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,359
Those macarons were a trap.

202
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,899
Josh is an emotional ninja.

203
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:31,889
He comes at you with sweets,
and then you just confess things.

204
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:35,559
So you're still avoiding that
conversation you owe him

205
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,579
about leaving him in the past.

206
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,879
That is not gonna be a good talk,

207
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,789
so we're not gonna have it.

208
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:41,799
We have real things to worry about,

209
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,327
like how you're gonna find
out the Dark King's secret.

210
00:08:43,328 --> 00:08:46,559
And we can't enjoy mango yuzu macarons

211
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,665
while we worry about that?

212
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:50,659
Never take the food, Eliot.

213
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,272
Which gives me an idea.

214
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,099
Seb, I brought you something.

215
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,880
Oh, my God.

216
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,979
Are you okay?

217
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,779
Six children.

218
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:13,739
Six children taken.

219
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,219
It's my fault.

220
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:18,759
If I'd have been there,
I could've stopped them.

221
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,139
Being a king...

222
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,368
nobody knows what it's really like.

223
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,819
Seb...

224
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,711
do you think you could ever step down?

225
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,809
I have to be king.

226
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,880
You don't have to be anything.

227
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,180
I could help you.

228
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,690
Eliot, I appreciate your concern

229
00:09:50,695 --> 00:09:52,919
more than I can say.

230
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,499
This is my burden.

231
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,359
I can't leave.

232
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,799
Is it something we can fix?

233
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,819
A spell or a curse of some kind.

234
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:06,999
A choice I made a long time ago,

235
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,339
tied to a conduit.

236
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,620
I thought it was the only
way I could save Fillory.

237
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,179
A conduit? What do you mean?

238
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,987
It was a lifetime ago.

239
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,789
So many lifetimes ago.

240
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,080
We could just get out of here.

241
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,819
We could just go camping or, um...

242
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,080
I'm sorry.

243
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:03,434
I forgot myself.

244
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,879
Look, Seb, we can make this okay.

245
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,706
Perhaps we shouldn't
see each other again.

246
00:11:28,359 --> 00:11:29,589
Sorry, Ray.

247
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:32,119
I gotta test you for
spine-burrowing spiders.

248
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,066
You know the drill. Chew, don't swallow.

249
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,469
Your Primula scotica isobelae
is flourishing, Baxie.

250
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,860
Spit.

251
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,570
Everyone's panties untwisted?

252
00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:51,009
Because it turned purple?

253
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,379
Purple is good,

254
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,879
uncontrollably shitting spiders is bad.

255
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,419
Ray, what do you make of...

256
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,219
All right, Glasses.

257
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,339
I'm going to say a word
that you don't know.

258
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,619
Phyllotaxis.

259
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,829
The arrangement of leaves
around a central stalk.

260
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,489
Oh, you're one of those?

261
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,619
Says the arrogant, dime-a-dozen academic

262
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,929
with a plant fetish.

263
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,739
But later when you recount
how you told me off,

264
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,729
I'm sure you'll punch it up
to be more of a dick chop.

265
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,739
Looks chaotic, but it's not.

266
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,179
If follows a mathematical sequence.

267
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,609
The leaves of this plant suggest that

268
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,342
its origin is exceptionally exotic.

269
00:12:20,343 --> 00:12:21,869
Or it is just a made-up drawing.

270
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:22,879
To an amateur,

271
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,119
I could see that being the
easiest explanation, yes,

272
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,714
but no. No, this has something.

273
00:12:26,715 --> 00:12:29,299
Plants, they have a certain
integrity to them, hmm?

274
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,320
It's hard to fake that.

275
00:12:30,321 --> 00:12:32,023
Do you think you can identify it?

276
00:12:32,024 --> 00:12:34,399
- Only guy who can.
- Mm, joy.

277
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,319
Would you be a sweetie and get me

278
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,879
a spectral-reactive phytometer,
a Bertric lens,

279
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,863
and a pamplemousse LaCroix?

280
00:12:40,864 --> 00:12:43,868
- Happy to.
- No. If I stay, I might kill him.

281
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:57,781
The Dark King's immortal
because of a conduit?

282
00:12:57,782 --> 00:12:59,716
Like, a vitality conduit?

283
00:12:59,717 --> 00:13:00,818
Do we know what that is?

284
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,919
Guess not.

285
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,849
It's an old naturalist ritual.

286
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:10,592
Draw life force from a stalk of
corn to fight a summer cold,

287
00:13:10,593 --> 00:13:11,599
that sort of thing.

288
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,164
Seb's immortality comes from corn?

289
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,819
What about a tree?

290
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:15,979
He had a tattoo of one

291
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,759
with what looked like maple
leaves, only more jagged.

292
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,929
Oh!

293
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,505
You can just talk.

294
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,539
Uh, that's a Blackwood tree.

295
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,073
Okay, so what if we locate

296
00:13:25,074 --> 00:13:27,199
the tree from Seb's
tattoo and chop it down?

297
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,446
Would that sever this conduit?

298
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,419
In theory, yes.

299
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,979
He would be mortal and 100% stab-able.

300
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,200
So how do we find this tree?

301
00:13:35,219 --> 00:13:38,122
Who has two thumbs and aced
their elective in dousing?

302
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,759
Probably safer to send
two of us, though.

303
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,993
Just in case something goes wrong.

304
00:13:44,994 --> 00:13:46,831
Well, I'm a former
tree goddess, I'll go.

305
00:13:46,832 --> 00:13:48,219
No!

306
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,059
You can't go on a long hike
because you have the...

307
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,300
toe worms.

308
00:13:52,303 --> 00:13:55,705
Oh, right, my toe worms.

309
00:13:55,706 --> 00:13:57,641
I thought that was just
a wooden toe thing.

310
00:13:57,642 --> 00:13:58,659
You thought wrong.

311
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,620
There's a lot of misinformation
about toe worms.

312
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,048
I have them. You gonna
make me take a hike?

313
00:14:04,049 --> 00:14:06,919
No. No worm shame here.

314
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,519
Okay. How about you, Margo?

315
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,359
Could use your Centurion skills

316
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,199
with all the Takers out there.

317
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,479
If you do that, it'll just leave me,

318
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,659
and I kind of have a problem.

319
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,862
After our last talk, Seb told
me to stay away from him,

320
00:14:19,863 --> 00:14:22,479
so I don't really think I'm
in a position to, you know,

321
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,100
stab him.

322
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:25,669
Yeah, but what if he needs you?

323
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,719
You're his Magician advisor.

324
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,169
Fen and I will come up with a problem

325
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,899
that takes two Magicians to fix...

326
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,060
assuming our toes can handle it.

327
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,379
It'll be touch-and-go.

328
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,619
Okay, but what if the
Dark King can feel it

329
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:42,419
when we chop down the tree
and we have to act quickly?

330
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,519
I just don't know how quick
I can be, given everything.

331
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,520
Don't worry. We'll make it work.

332
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,819
The fuck, Margo? You promised.

333
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,459
And I meant it.

334
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,419
You won't be the one
to kill Seb, exactly.

335
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,235
Why are you being so weird
and tricky about this?

336
00:14:58,236 --> 00:14:59,403
I thought I was clear.

337
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,069
- Thank you.
- Wait.

338
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,479
That is the worst mojito I have
ever had in my entire life.

339
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,579
That's because not a
mojito. It's a potion.

340
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,979
I was gonna explain before
you got all grabby,

341
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,086
but I guess here we go.

342
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,479
Ugh.

343
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,580
Seb needs to die.
You can't do it, but I can.

344
00:15:23,594 --> 00:15:24,794
So get ready to...

345
00:15:24,795 --> 00:15:26,229
Ovary up, bitch.

346
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,439
Margo, did we just "Freaky Friday?"

347
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,089
Bax!

348
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,056
What did you do to him?

349
00:15:52,057 --> 00:15:53,958
He's fine, he's fine.

350
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,959
Give me my page back.

351
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,119
Look... I will buy it from you.

352
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,163
Name your price.

353
00:16:00,164 --> 00:16:01,899
Put it down now.

354
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,169
Holy shit.

355
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,812
I just pushed him.

356
00:16:14,813 --> 00:16:16,700
It shouldn't have done that.

357
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,679
What the hell was that?

358
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,580
We need to seal this room.

359
00:16:29,994 --> 00:16:33,062
Jesus, Bambi. That was
kind of nonconsensual.

360
00:16:33,063 --> 00:16:34,763
You drank before I could explain.

361
00:16:34,764 --> 00:16:37,340
I have been trying to
figure out to help you.

362
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,736
This is the only way I could think of

363
00:16:38,737 --> 00:16:41,080
to keep your hands
clean of Seb's murder.

364
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:42,499
Except they literally won't be.

365
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,739
Those are my hands.

366
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,175
Look, you're the one who can get close,

367
00:16:45,176 --> 00:16:46,699
I'm the one with the will to stab.

368
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:52,439
El, I love you, but we
have to do this thing.

369
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,151
Even you agree with that.

370
00:16:55,986 --> 00:16:58,289
This is the best compromise
I could come up with.

371
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,919
So listen up... this
spell's got a little quirk

372
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,859
you should probably know about.

373
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:07,164
Tell anyone we've swapped and
we won't be able to swap back...

374
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,659
permanently.

375
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,167
That is good to know.

376
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:14,929
Strange.

377
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:17,272
It's like you're Eliot but not Eliot.

378
00:17:17,273 --> 00:17:19,105
Oh, my God, you're seeing Charlton.

379
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:20,979
What kind of a name is Charlton?

380
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,343
Family name. I never liked it.

381
00:17:22,344 --> 00:17:23,980
He lives in my head... your head.

382
00:17:23,981 --> 00:17:25,959
And why is there a man
living in your head?

383
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,099
Charlton and I were
Monster victims together.

384
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,619
He stayed in my head when
you pulled the Monster out.

385
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:34,040
I held on real tight.

386
00:17:34,058 --> 00:17:36,794
So if he's in your head,
why didn't he swap with you?

387
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,879
I have no idea.

388
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,662
Honestly, this is all very new.

389
00:17:40,663 --> 00:17:43,534
I'd have given you a heads-up
if I'd known your plan.

390
00:17:43,535 --> 00:17:47,129
Listen. Charlie, stay
the fuck out of my way.

391
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,229
Hey, Bambi? Before you go all...

392
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,139
Bambi, and scare him off,

393
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,939
why don't you maybe let him help you?

394
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,200
I've managed just fine

395
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,848
without a Tyler Durden
up my cooch, thanks.

396
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,379
I'm just saying

397
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,739
this Seb situation is
pretty complicated.

398
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,169
You're not exactly a...

399
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,079
subtle relationship person.

400
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,422
From what I've seen, he's right.

401
00:18:06,423 --> 00:18:09,879
He's gotta ride a really fine
line with the Dark King.

402
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:14,040
He lost his love, but he likes me,

403
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,733
so that feels like a betrayal.

404
00:18:15,734 --> 00:18:17,999
That is a lot of drama to track.

405
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,999
What about you and Josh?

406
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,460
Since I'll be going on a long walk

407
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:24,069
to cut down a tree with him,

408
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,275
is there anything I should know?

409
00:18:25,276 --> 00:18:26,299
Yeah.

410
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,912
If Josh tries to pull you
into any kind of talk,

411
00:18:28,913 --> 00:18:30,719
just don't.

412
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,469
I was a little surprised
to get your message

413
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,979
after our last convo.

414
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:49,759
I know things got complicated.

415
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,139
The circumstances have changed.

416
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,419
Castle has been struck with
a strange sleeping curse.

417
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,799
Is that what happened to...

418
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,899
wow.

419
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,099
We've kept it quiet.

420
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,679
Obviously, it requires
a magical solution,

421
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,050
but I'm afraid it's beyond me.

422
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,384
I think I know this curse.

423
00:19:10,385 --> 00:19:11,959
Good news, there's a cure.

424
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,589
Only prob: It takes a bit
of cooperative spellwork.

425
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,749
You need four hands to do it.

426
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,559
- I see.
- So you wanna solve this,

427
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,619
we're gonna have to work together,

428
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,519
even if it makes uncomf or whatevs.

429
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,959
You sound strange.

430
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,559
I haven't been feeling myself.

431
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,339
Since our last talk.

432
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,569
Yes.

433
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:37,969
Let us work together to
solve this curious malady,

434
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:39,516
for the good of Fillory.

435
00:19:41,151 --> 00:19:42,986
That could've gone smoother.

436
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,919
Sleeping pollen worked like a charm.

437
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,999
Or a curse, I guess.

438
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,479
Oh, Umber's balls.

439
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,640
Margo just keeps leaving
her uniform lying around.

440
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,919
Makes me feel like a maid.

441
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,919
Right.

442
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,600
Julia, let me take over.
Rest is good for the baby.

443
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:17,160
Not a baby. Still baking.

444
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:19,079
But it'll become a baby.

445
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,819
You do know how this works, right?

446
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,160
Look, Fen,

447
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:24,820
I just want to live my life

448
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:28,119
without this defining every
aspect of it, you get me?

449
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,359
Okay, well, if that's the truth

450
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,268
then why haven't you
done something about it?

451
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:34,119
It's not a hard procedure,
not even in Fillory.

452
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,503
You think I should abort it?

453
00:20:35,504 --> 00:20:37,174
I'm saying you should make a choice.

454
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,339
You're letting something into your life

455
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,915
that you can't control and in
lots of ways will control you.

456
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,379
It'll make you happy,

457
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,087
or devastate you.

458
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,099
Yeah.

459
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,893
Look, I've been pregnant before,

460
00:20:55,894 --> 00:20:58,719
and it was really bad.

461
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,279
And I knew this time if I
told everyone about it,

462
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,640
they'd get worried and overprotective

463
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:06,499
and I just wanted to take
one of the next nine months

464
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,079
to feel like maybe this time

465
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,775
it wouldn't be so terrible, you know?

466
00:21:11,776 --> 00:21:15,199
Nine months? What are you talking about?

467
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,412
It's Red Monkey Month.

468
00:21:16,413 --> 00:21:18,415
- Red Monkey what?
- Everything goes faster

469
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,079
in Red Monkey Month.

470
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,539
Healing, crop growth,

471
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,049
weirdly, not monkeys.

472
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,759
I'm sorry, are you saying
that my pregnancy

473
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,191
is going to be sped up?

474
00:21:27,192 --> 00:21:28,779
Julia, it already is.

475
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,359
As long as you stay in Fillory.

476
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,320
Oh, Jesus Christ.

477
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,119
- Get the fuck away from me.
- What's wrong?

478
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,341
I thought I saw a butterfly.

479
00:21:45,742 --> 00:21:47,710
You never know where
they're gonna go next.

480
00:21:47,711 --> 00:21:50,139
Lavender rose macaron?

481
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,215
- I know they're your favorite.
- I'd better not.

482
00:21:52,216 --> 00:21:55,260
Margo, it's a snack, not a trap.

483
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,659
You're a really good baker.

484
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,679
Also taller from this POV.

485
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,160
I learned to dial in that recipe

486
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,699
while I was stuck in the past.

487
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,540
Fen had her knives, I had baking.

488
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:15,003
Oh, yeah. That must've
been tough for you both.

489
00:22:15,004 --> 00:22:18,479
It was. I mean... sorry,
I didn't mean to bring it up.

490
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,799
We don't have to talk about it.

491
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,239
Okay. How much further, you think?

492
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,979
It's just we thought we lost you guys,

493
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,799
and it was a scary time, so...

494
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,279
So we must be getting
near Seb's tree, huh?

495
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,659
Are we really not gonna do this?

496
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:32,379
Look, I'd be lying if
I said it didn't hurt

497
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,039
when you wanted to
abandon me in the past,

498
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,579
but I know it wasn't about me.

499
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,460
Still, Margo, I have to ask.

500
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:39,829
Do you wanna break up?

501
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:42,633
I mean, are we even a thing
that can be broken up?

502
00:22:42,634 --> 00:22:45,769
I... what do you think?

503
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,160
Sometimes I feel like
that's what you want.

504
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:51,499
Look, when we got together,
I said I wasn't into games,

505
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,848
and do you remember what you said?

506
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:54,844
Oh.

507
00:22:54,845 --> 00:22:56,712
You said, "Fuck games."

508
00:22:56,713 --> 00:22:58,313
That does sound like me.

509
00:22:58,314 --> 00:23:00,651
I can accept it's over if
you just say the words.

510
00:23:00,652 --> 00:23:04,054
Josh, I wanna talk.
I really do, but I can't.

511
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,219
Except to say

512
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,079
that maybe I need a little more time

513
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,062
to forgive myself.

514
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,889
Oh. Uh, really?

515
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:18,739
Yes! Because I've realized

516
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,304
that deciding to leave you
in the past was a mistake...

517
00:23:21,305 --> 00:23:22,669
a big one.

518
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:25,479
And now I need to earn your forgiveness,

519
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,579
which may take a while,

520
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,899
so we can kind of keep things status quo

521
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,059
in the meantime.

522
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:34,159
I... sure, sure.

523
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,409
Great.

524
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:36,853
Now, which way to the tree?

525
00:23:36,854 --> 00:23:38,990
Uh...

526
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,020
I think Ray was hosting a symbiote.

527
00:23:48,031 --> 00:23:50,299
- He was possessed?
- Not possessed.

528
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,779
It's rare, but a few fungus
species have been known

529
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:55,103
to join consciousness
with other creatures.

530
00:23:55,104 --> 00:23:57,899
You're still you, you just
share brainpower, thoughts.

531
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,339
And then you explode.

532
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,840
Well, I'm not a mushroom guy,

533
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:01,999
but I think that's because

534
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,779
Ray merged with the fungus
a long, long time ago.

535
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,849
Is he... shit, are they dead?

536
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:08,579
Ray is,

537
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,940
but those particles that came
out of him were fungal spores.

538
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,419
They'll want a new host body.

539
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,999
I sealed them inside the lab,

540
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,027
but it might be a good idea
to close the air vents.

541
00:24:17,028 --> 00:24:19,199
Yeah, hi. New to this job.

542
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,040
I have no idea how to
control the school vents.

543
00:24:21,798 --> 00:24:22,999
We need to evacuate.

544
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,180
Knew I should've trusted my instincts.

545
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,160
Hey, hey! There's a, um...

546
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,499
Eukaryotic photosymbiont.

547
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,174
Yeah, there's a monster on the loose.

548
00:24:35,175 --> 00:24:38,782
Head to the Physical Kids'
Cottage to be quarantined now.

549
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,919
Alice, give us the plant page...

550
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,989
Then we'll stop spreading.

551
00:24:49,459 --> 00:24:51,989
Oh, oh. Okay!

552
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,959
New theory: The fungus can
spread to multiple hosts.

553
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,333
This might be a zombie plague situation.

554
00:24:57,334 --> 00:24:58,429
- What?
- What?

555
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,409
I say this is the man who
blew up my Brakebills.

556
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:12,449
You're the worst goddamn
dean we've ever had.

557
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:15,949
Yeah, I'm not here for a
lecture from my prisoner.

558
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,399
Just hiding from spores.

559
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,919
Oh, so you remember

560
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,760
that this room is hermetically sealed,

561
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,955
but not to consult the
"Do Not Admit" list?

562
00:25:22,956 --> 00:25:25,179
I did everything a dean
is supposed to do.

563
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:28,019
A dean is supposed to
have strong instincts,

564
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,099
like knowing anyone who'd visit Anansia

565
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,802
is also insane enough
to visit other worlds

566
00:25:32,803 --> 00:25:35,403
with infections for
which we cannot test.

567
00:25:35,404 --> 00:25:37,460
- Do you want to help or what?
- Yes.

568
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,799
I can provide a solution...

569
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,545
in exchange for my release.

570
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:43,299
How do we know you really have one?

571
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,482
I developed a potion
with a Dr. Maria Pilkin.

572
00:25:46,483 --> 00:25:48,751
You can check with her.

573
00:25:48,752 --> 00:25:50,119
But...

574
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,722
she died in this timeline.

575
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,350
No deal.

576
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,889
We'll find our own way.

577
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,697
You cannot save your
students without my help.

578
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,699
See, in our timeline

579
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,229
Pilkin's work was published
after her death,

580
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,170
so it's in our library.

581
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,639
Gave away your leverage.

582
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,110
Thought a dean was supposed
to have strong instincts.

583
00:26:14,111 --> 00:26:16,609
I will get out of here,

584
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:20,379
and then I'll turn you into lobsters

585
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,679
and eat you.

586
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,680
Uh, okay.

587
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,819
Okay, the book we need is right there.

588
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,299
- See any twitching?
- Just assume they're all infected.

589
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,129
And assume they're all looking for us.

590
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,706
It's too risky for us to go in together.

591
00:26:43,707 --> 00:26:46,339
I know where it is. I'll go.

592
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:49,219
Hey. Remember, magic is
unpredictable outside the lab.

593
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,319
So no phosphoromancy.

594
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,679
Good thing I have experience
being invisible from high school.

595
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,809
Ooh, ooh.

596
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,089
You got us the book and a guinea pig.

597
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,649
Nice work.

598
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:09,759
It said the potion should work fast.

599
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,160
Penny.

600
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,439
Oh, shit.

601
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,760
Penny.

602
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,569
Just give up the page, Alice.

603
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,540
Almost ready.

604
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,799
Great.

605
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,060
Uh...

606
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:46,359
Margo, you have to draw this out.

607
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,959
The second they wake,
Seb will dismiss you.

608
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,365
No shit, Sherlock.

609
00:28:49,366 --> 00:28:51,167
This is all part of my
plan to win him over.

610
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,659
How is finishing the ritual

611
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:54,429
early and in silence part of your plan?

612
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,620
Because I taught it to him wrong,

613
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:59,409
so to fix it, I'm gonna have to
get real close and personal.

614
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:01,099
Eliot?

615
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,999
Something in the middle section
doesn't feeling right.

616
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,581
The energies aren't
moving as they should.

617
00:29:04,582 --> 00:29:06,079
Hmm.

618
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,550
I can walk you through it.

619
00:29:14,124 --> 00:29:16,258
Wait.

620
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:17,961
That's not right.

621
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,400
Here.

622
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,660
We should keep our distance.

623
00:29:29,673 --> 00:29:31,939
It will make things easier.

624
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,379
Right.

625
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,644
Of course.

626
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,719
If you need my help, just ask.

627
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,119
Jesus' clits.

628
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,749
I know how to work a guy, Charlton.

629
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:43,889
Yes. You do, Margo.

630
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:45,679
As Eliot, you're coming on too strong.

631
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,624
Seb likes Eliot's vulnerability.

632
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:50,519
Don't be pushy, just open up.

633
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,820
He and Eliot are close because
of the losses they share.

634
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,629
I can show you the rest if you're ready.

635
00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:03,640
But first, I think I owe you an apology.

636
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:06,200
- Eliot, that's not necessary.
- It's just...

637
00:30:06,209 --> 00:30:08,511
I haven't felt this way
in a really long time.

638
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,879
I think the fact that we both...

639
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,352
it just felt safe with you, you know?

640
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,289
On that mountain we both felt it.

641
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,219
There's nothing wrong with wanting more.

642
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:24,859
I wish I could give you more,

643
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,929
but I just can't.

644
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:30,667
I must put Fillory first,
even if it means I suffer.

645
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,437
I do hope you understand that.

646
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,079
I get it.

647
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,259
It's hard to be king.

648
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,010
People don't know what you go through.

649
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,999
Now let me show you how
to do that spell correctly.

650
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,919
Are we close to the tree?

651
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,803
I don't mean to rush. You're the expert.

652
00:31:06,804 --> 00:31:08,609
Okay, that's it.

653
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:09,806
I'm not buying it.

654
00:31:09,807 --> 00:31:12,469
- Not buying what?
- Any of this.

655
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,909
Emotional, agreeable, patient?

656
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,846
- You're not Margo.
- Who else would I be?

657
00:31:16,847 --> 00:31:19,279
This is Fillory. I don't know.

658
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,079
You could be a hallucination,

659
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,419
or... or a shapeshifter,

660
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,654
or an agent of the Dark King.

661
00:31:24,655 --> 00:31:28,099
But I'm not. Josh, I'm...

662
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,819
shit.

663
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,194
I wish I could explain.

664
00:31:31,195 --> 00:31:34,964
Oh, well, until you do,
I'm not taking you to the tree.

665
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,600
Got it?

666
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,949
The antifungal kind of worked.

667
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,249
We got the spores out of him.

668
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:51,799
Yeah, and into Penny.

669
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,039
It must be the fungus'
networking ability.

670
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,319
Long as it's alive in other hosts,

671
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,499
it can still direct its spores
into whoever it wants.

672
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,756
So why not into us? We were right there.

673
00:31:59,757 --> 00:32:01,739
Penny was closer?

674
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,768
I thought you were an expert.

675
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:04,529
I told you this isn't my area.

676
00:32:04,530 --> 00:32:08,096
At this point, my best advice?
Give the fungus what it wants.

677
00:32:08,097 --> 00:32:09,559
No.

678
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,599
Ever since I found this page
I knew it was important.

679
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,919
If the fungus wants it, I was right.

680
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,399
I have to know what it means.

681
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,940
Is it worth dying over?

682
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:20,799
Is that what Quentin would
want? For you to die, too?

683
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,712
Back the fuck off, botanist.

684
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,548
Sorry. Maybe I overstepped.

685
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:28,651
It's just...

686
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:32,688
Remember that plant I put on
the windowsill in the lab?

687
00:32:32,689 --> 00:32:34,457
Yeah, you only screamed at me about it.

688
00:32:34,458 --> 00:32:36,059
Scottish primrose.

689
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,629
It's this fragile little flower.

690
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:38,859
Even grass can kill it,

691
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:42,232
so it has to survive on cliff
walls where nothing else can.

692
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,220
It was my wife Isobel's favorite.

693
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:52,008
Primula scotica isobelae.
You named it after her?

694
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:53,676
You remembered the name.

695
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,219
She loved that stupid flower.

696
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,919
Kept it alive without any spellwork.

697
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,749
Huge point of pride.

698
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:05,488
But I thought it was just kind of silly.

699
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,489
Then she died, so now I keep it alive.

700
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,629
If it's anything like that,

701
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:16,299
I get why you'd wanna keep that page.

702
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,799
How long ago?

703
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,339
Five years. You?

704
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,969
A lot less.

705
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:30,499
So how long until, you know, it feels

706
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,582
less like it's eating all of you?

707
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:34,450
I'm kind of still waiting.

708
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,620
I just feel like I'm gonna be

709
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:40,289
this walking whatever-I-am forever.

710
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,558
I did too.

711
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,799
It starts like this tight
ball in your chest,

712
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,199
but over time, it gets lighter

713
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,889
because it just kind of
spreads into the rest of you.

714
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:54,759
It's like your own personal symbiote.

715
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,559
Yeah, kind of.

716
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:01,744
Except not murderous and
weirdly paper-focused.

717
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:05,214
Just, uh... sad.

718
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,580
Yeah.

719
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,659
Make it to a year.

720
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:15,889
It'll still suck, but it gets quieter.

721
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:18,300
I promise.

722
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,999
Shit.

723
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,405
I know what to do.

724
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,645
Damn.

725
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:39,609
I actually felt bad for him,
for what he's been through.

726
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:42,409
He's a nice man, but an evil king.

727
00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:44,259
It doesn't make sense.

728
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,249
He seems kind.

729
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,458
He seems sad.

730
00:34:49,459 --> 00:34:52,629
Why the fuck would he summon
those monsters into Fillory?

731
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,059
Eliot.

732
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,767
I think we're finished. It worked.

733
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:01,720
Before you go, perhaps we should talk?

734
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,519
I don't know why he summoned them,

735
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,760
but I don't think we're gonna
get another chance at this.

736
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,189
Not as easy as it looks, is it?

737
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:24,489
Josh, please.

738
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:25,899
Eliot's waiting for the signal.

739
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,003
If we don't chop down the tree,

740
00:35:27,004 --> 00:35:28,064
he's screwed. We're screwed!

741
00:35:28,065 --> 00:35:30,039
You said you wish you could explain.

742
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,501
That means there's something
to explain, so explain.

743
00:35:32,502 --> 00:35:34,859
So you've been wanting
to talk to me for weeks

744
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,199
about what happened between us,

745
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,199
but when I finally apologize

746
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,343
you accuse me of being possessed.

747
00:35:40,344 --> 00:35:41,739
Right, apologize.

748
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:42,948
Does that sound like Margo to you?

749
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,499
Fine!

750
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,219
Maybe I was saying what
you wanted to hear,

751
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,209
'cause you never let up.

752
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:49,699
You keep trying to get me
to talk about something

753
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,019
I don't wanna talk about.

754
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:54,499
Okay. Fine, I get that.

755
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,519
You wanna know the truth?

756
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,179
You picked someone who
will never put your first.

757
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,789
There's no fixing Margo... I mean me,

758
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,699
'cause chances are
if I had to relive it,

759
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,399
I'd make the same decision.

760
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,959
So stop asking me to
apologize for something

761
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,037
I don't feel sorry about.

762
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,941
Now you sound like you.

763
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:15,511
Not that I won't feel
differently tomorrow.

764
00:36:15,512 --> 00:36:19,579
No, you won't. You're very clear.

765
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,599
The Conduit Tree's that one over there.

766
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,889
Cut it down.

767
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,287
I'll give Eliot the green light.

768
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,380
Oh, God.

769
00:36:28,391 --> 00:36:29,549
I'm fine here.

770
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,324
Go help the others search the castle

771
00:36:31,325 --> 00:36:34,230
for any remaining victims
of the sleeping curse.

772
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,029
What you said last night...

773
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:44,699
did you mean it?

774
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,620
Um...

775
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,039
Oh, right.

776
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,919
Uh, Eliot asked Seb if he'd
consider giving up the throne.

777
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,999
He even offered to help
him, but Seb said no.

778
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,209
Eliot, are you all right?

779
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:57,760
Yes, sorry.

780
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:59,279
Of course I meant it.

781
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,089
Because I've been thinking.

782
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:04,119
Margo, the candles. That's the signal.

783
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,620
They cut down Seb's tree.

784
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:08,320
- Eliot?
- It's now or never.

785
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,200
Eliot should be done by now.

786
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:23,779
- Well, they're in a hurry.
- Gods, we're in trouble.

787
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,944
Here, take my extra knife.

788
00:37:24,945 --> 00:37:26,079
All the knives in the world

789
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,449
won't get us past the Centurions.

790
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:29,699
Do you have a better plan?

791
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,329
Are you under a hex? A witch's spell?

792
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:33,479
What's going on?

793
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,319
I can explain. Just...

794
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,699
there will be serious
consequences if I do.

795
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,729
No, you can't tell him.

796
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:40,799
Margo, you'll be stuck in there.

797
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,979
There will be serious consequences

798
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,266
if you don't explain.

799
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,932
You asked and I'm here.

800
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:18,879
So...

801
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,671
you gonna give up the page
or make us spore you, too?

802
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,043
I'll give it to you.

803
00:38:28,711 --> 00:38:30,847
If you tell me why you want it.

804
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,999
It's an instruction manual.

805
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,618
- For what?
- The World Seed.

806
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:38,220
It's magical botanical organism.

807
00:38:38,221 --> 00:38:40,789
Legend is, the seed is pure potential.

808
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:44,499
The right nurturing, it can
grow into almost everything...

809
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,095
even an entire world.

810
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,209
Well, if you want the page,

811
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:49,919
does that mean you
already have the seed?

812
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,860
We're done talking.

813
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,699
Alice?

814
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,148
What are you doing to us?

815
00:39:06,149 --> 00:39:07,840
Me?

816
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:09,552
I'm just keeping you talking.

817
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,452
All that shared brainpower

818
00:39:11,453 --> 00:39:13,579
and you never thought to yourselves,

819
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,689
where's Bax?

820
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,869
I mean, you had us stumped for a while.

821
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:20,439
It seemed like if we got
you out of one host

822
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,279
you'd just keep spreading
yourself to other ones,

823
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,630
but you didn't.

824
00:39:23,633 --> 00:39:26,635
For some reason,
you were limiting yourself.

825
00:39:26,636 --> 00:39:29,271
Some of your spores
didn't try to spread.

826
00:39:29,272 --> 00:39:30,339
Bax wasn't sure why

827
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:34,620
because fungi can
typically grow and grow.

828
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:38,300
But you're also a
consciousness, like us.

829
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:41,840
And we have limits.

830
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:45,239
Try to juggle too much at
once and we're useless.

831
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,657
It's a professor thing. Just go with it.

832
00:39:47,658 --> 00:39:52,280
So I have Bax spreading you
too thin to affect your hosts

833
00:39:52,295 --> 00:39:54,297
mentally or physically.

834
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:58,234
You won't be able to
control them anymore.

835
00:39:58,235 --> 00:40:00,469
- You're killing me.
- No.

836
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:04,279
Don't worry, you'll be a
part of your host forever.

837
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,559
You're just getting quieter.

838
00:40:20,957 --> 00:40:23,959
This is the worst fucking job ever.

839
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,729
Penny, are you okay?

840
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,139
Got your page.

841
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,919
Did you know why you wanted it?

842
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,289
It's fading, but...

843
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:36,739
to sell.

844
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,829
There was this huge debt to pay.

845
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:43,329
I don't know what for, but...

846
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:45,399
when The Couple came
to collect, we didn't...

847
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,416
they didn't ask any questions.

848
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,279
A couple of?

849
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,580
No. The Couple.

850
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,591
Weird name, but I remember
feeling scared shitless.

851
00:40:55,592 --> 00:40:57,619
The Couple has power.

852
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:59,780
It has resources.

853
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,779
It's been looking for the
World Seed page a long time,

854
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,367
and they are not good people.

855
00:41:05,368 --> 00:41:08,329
And they know I have what they want.

856
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:09,539
I don't think that's gonna be

857
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,841
the last person or thing
to come after it.

858
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,849
The hell was Coldwater doing

859
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:18,114
with instructions to
something so powerful?

860
00:41:18,115 --> 00:41:20,060
Yeah.

861
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,819
I have no idea.

862
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,379
Jesus Christ, El. You had one job:

863
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,079
Don't blow up my relationship with Josh.

864
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:31,279
- And what did you do?
- I'm sorry.

865
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,999
There's no way to avoid
that conversation.

866
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,189
He's just so goddamn persistent.

867
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,449
Tell me about it.

868
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:38,549
By the by,

869
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:40,603
Charlton's gonna go hang
out in your beach memories

870
00:41:40,604 --> 00:41:41,819
for a while.

871
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,619
Think the whole Seb
thing was hard on him.

872
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:46,359
So um, what did you and Seb talk about?

873
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,439
You know, before?

874
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,469
Don't do this to yourself.

875
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:52,160
I ended your relationship.

876
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:54,316
Seems like I deserve whatever
pain's coming my way.

877
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,219
That wasn't your fault.

878
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,219
You were just dealing
with some shit I set up

879
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,419
way before you took over.

880
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,199
So in summation,

881
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,927
we're both equally skilled at
destroying our own happiness?

882
00:42:04,928 --> 00:42:06,619
Yeah.

883
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:10,600
Well, at least we used
our powers for good?

884
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,303
How fucked up is it that I miss him?

885
00:42:14,304 --> 00:42:17,360
El, there's nothing wrong with you.

886
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,779
He was hot and complicated.

887
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,559
Those are the ones worth banging.

888
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,919
You've just had some shitty luck

889
