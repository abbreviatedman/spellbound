1
00:00:01,201 --> 00:00:03,136
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:07,299
I see blood on the walls. I
hear its voice. It wants out.

3
00:00:07,374 --> 00:00:08,518
Have you tried letting it out?

4
00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:09,669
<i>Charlton?</i>

5
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:12,212
<i>I once was possessed
by The Monster, too.</i>

6
00:00:12,312 --> 00:00:14,338
When all the scary
creatures were pulled out,

7
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:16,679
I held on tight as I could
in your Happy Place.

8
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,151
I found this in Q's
stuff at Brakebills.

9
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:22,917
Professor... I mean,
Dean Adiyodi?

10
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,457
Yeah. Come in.

11
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,016
<i>What did you do with Fogg 17?</i>

12
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:28,118
I call that one "Psycho Fogg."

13
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:30,494
Put him in the Clean Room.
He can't cast there, so...

14
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:31,930
I can't do what I need to do

15
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,872
if I'm worried about
how it's gonna affect you.

16
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:35,300
I think we need to be done.

17
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:38,236
I'm interviewing for the
botany job. Hamish Bax.

18
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:42,036
If I'm right, this should adjust
Circumstances in the entire greenhouse.

19
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:43,508
<i>Allowing us to cast.</i>

20
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,006
You risked everything for us.

21
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,949
The least we can do
is to show you the truth.

22
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,093
You can't outrun me!

23
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:29,118
Six children
taken. It's horrific.

24
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:31,657
The Takers are
swarming. It's my fault.

25
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,626
They're swarming because
Seb summoned them with a spell

26
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:37,926
using the gold I gave him. I didn't
know what he was going to do with it.

27
00:01:38,298 --> 00:01:39,391
The Takers.

28
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:41,592
That's how he stays in power.

29
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:44,001
He summons them, and
only he can fight them.

30
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,369
Jesus, I go away to my
nephew's bar mitzvah

31
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,320
for one week, and then
everything gets <i>fercockt.</i>

32
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:49,375
What are we going to do?

33
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,603
We got to kill the Dark King.

34
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:54,308
What? We're all thinking it.

35
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:57,475
Eli's Torah portion was
all about the sanctity of life,

36
00:01:57,584 --> 00:01:59,280
and I found it very moving.

37
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:03,288
So, can't we, I don't know,
peacefully overthrow him?

38
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,983
No, we can't.

39
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:08,820
He's got a Centurion army, I
should know. I'm one of them.

40
00:02:08,996 --> 00:02:10,589
Also 300 years of propaganda

41
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:11,908
convincing everyone
they need him.

42
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:13,958
Also, also, 300 years?

43
00:02:14,034 --> 00:02:17,129
We're talking a powerful,
immortal Magician?

44
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:19,571
Doubt you can just
walk up and stab the guy.

45
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,131
I've been researching.

46
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:23,521
The Dark King's survived
seven assassination attempts

47
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,671
since he took our thrones. Must
be big magic keeping him alive.

48
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,840
We have to figure
out what it is.

49
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:30,042
Find out his weakness.

50
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,413
You're on board with this, too?

51
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,818
I mean, I'm here to stop
an apocalypse that happens

52
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:36,288
'cause an evil force
invades from a distant realm.

53
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:39,317
That sounds like the
Takers. Then it's settled.

54
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:40,655
We kill the Dark King,

55
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:43,526
stop the Takers from pouring
in, stop the apocalypse. Who's in?

56
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,292
Just a couple of Qs.

57
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,857
Like, how are we gonna get
close enough to the Dark King

58
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,608
to learn his weakness
and assassinate him?

59
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,971
We're a cook, a maid, a
army grunt, a Julia, and a...

60
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:56,437
Counselor/confidant.

61
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,638
You got to admit, El,
you're perfectly placed.

62
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,412
Plus, he's always dismissing his
guards when you come around.

63
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,876
Why does me liking somebody
always end up with them dying?

64
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:07,648
You should tell
your friends, Eliot.

65
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:10,850
That I don't want to save
Fillory because I caught feelings?

66
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,958
I'm saying, they should
know how you feel

67
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:15,153
before they try to make you
do something you'll regret.

68
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:17,220
No, I'll just look
selfish, Charlton.

69
00:03:17,798 --> 00:03:19,733
And I'll still end
up having to do it.

70
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,233
Talking to somebody? Um...

71
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:25,068
Myself. I'm psyching myself up.

72
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:27,204
Fillory needs the
Dark King dead,

73
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:29,266
and I am the obvious inside man.

74
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,376
You sound weird.

75
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:31,843
You sound weird. Okay,

76
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:33,244
it's that Eliot.

77
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:34,947
Uh...

78
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,812
I know I'm just a guy
who has to live inside

79
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,351
your tragic
remembrances and all,

80
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,818
but I truly don't understand
why you won't at least tell her.

81
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,580
Margo, look.

82
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:46,486
I'm not sure I can
go through with this.

83
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,927
El, you have a crush on
a boy who's bad for you.

84
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:51,863
Happens to all of us. But how do
we get crushes out of our system?

85
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:56,130
Lots of drinking, pining.
Some detailed sex fantasies.

86
00:03:56,236 --> 00:04:00,298
No. We bang them
out. Okay, that's great,

87
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,527
except for the part where
now I have to murder the guy

88
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,067
I just hypothetically
slept with,

89
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:07,024
which is a thing that shouldn't really
happen to a person more than once.

90
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,050
El, Fillory does need this.

91
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,686
So if you can't
do it, tell me now.

92
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,749
I know he has to die,

93
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:19,987
but I don't hate
him. I don't. I can't.

94
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:22,059
I can't make
betraying Seb easier,

95
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:23,722
but let me help make it simpler.

96
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:27,333
Say you didn't have
to kill him yourself?

97
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:28,694
But I'm the one with access.

98
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:29,964
Even you just said it.

99
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:33,302
You're also my best friend.
If you can find his weakness,

100
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:36,103
I'll find a way you don't have
to be the one to do it. I promise.

101
00:04:36,176 --> 00:04:37,176
How?

102
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,038
I have no fucking idea,

103
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,709
but I'll figure it
out for you, okay?

104
00:04:45,352 --> 00:04:46,615
Okay.

105
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:01,265
You took the thing. The
panel. You can't just...

106
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:03,369
This is mass floricide.

107
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,464
Sorry, I had to bring the
panel here, so I could study it.

108
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,836
Sorry, can't hear you
over my plants dying.

109
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,441
Is this a western-facing window?

110
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:15,291
And now we have a working
classroom because, you know,

111
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,682
school for Magicians,
not flowers.

112
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:20,610
I took the botany job 'cause
you fixed up the greenhouse.

113
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:22,747
Should've known you'd
just turn around and wreck it.

114
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,689
Here, let me explain
how that feels.

115
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:29,553
Wait, don't touch that.

116
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:32,125
Ah. Thick venation
through the leaves,

117
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:33,997
and look at the asymmetry here.

118
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,398
Do you recognize it?

119
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,027
Don't think it's terrestrial.

120
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:38,915
You'd need a
classification expert

121
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:40,669
with the right magical tools.

122
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,810
I know a taxonomist
who's been around,

123
00:05:43,877 --> 00:05:45,812
you know, the multiverse.

124
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:48,107
Well, do you think we
can get him to come here?

125
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:49,877
Don't see why not.

126
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,946
I'll tell you why not.

127
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,681
Your pal Raylan is on the
Dean's "Do Not Admit" list.

128
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:57,416
You're Acting Dean.
Can't you just... Alice.

129
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:59,655
He's a botanist. PENNY: Yes!

130
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:03,827
Who visited a world called Anansia,
home to some highly infectious shit.

131
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:05,729
He's still alive, isn't he?

132
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:09,425
Magical phytologists do
crazy shit, but Ray's smart.

133
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,164
I doubt he's carrying anything.

134
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,264
Well, dangerous.

135
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,275
No offense, but I'm gonna
trust the file with the red stamp.

136
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,321
Look, the only place on
Earth right now with magic

137
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:21,213
stable enough for Ray
to examine it is in our lab,

138
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:24,149
thanks to me installing the
Circumstances control panel for you.

139
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,709
Don't you think figuring
out the deal with magic

140
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,982
is more important than
translating some page

141
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,523
you found out about a plant?

142
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:33,557
I found it in Quentin's desk.

143
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,359
This thing, it makes no sense.

144
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,697
Except it was important to Q.

145
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:45,364
So, maybe it's important
we figure out what it is.

146
00:06:49,776 --> 00:06:51,745
If we test him thoroughly,

147
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,717
and he's clean, he can come.

148
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:07,785
Hey, Fen. Yeah?

149
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,757
Can I ask you something? Yeah.

150
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,099
Um, lately I've just
been feeling a little bit off.

151
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,835
If we were on Earth, I'd
know what to do, but...

152
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,129
Is there, like, a magic
plant or something out here

153
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:22,141
that I can pee on
to find out if I'm...

154
00:07:22,242 --> 00:07:23,608
Pregnant.

155
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:25,376
Shit.

156
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:28,581
Sorry. God, I don't know
why I'm crying. Just... Babies.

157
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,224
Um, do you know
what you're gonna do?

158
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,310
Um,

159
00:07:34,421 --> 00:07:36,049
I'm not so sure.

160
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:39,049
Do you want me to
send a bunny to Penny?

161
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:40,426
Uh,

162
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,092
Penny and I are just...

163
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,125
We're sort of in
a weird place. Oh.

164
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:47,426
Actually, until I've had
some time to process, uh...

165
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,946
I'd really appreciate
it if we could keep this

166
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,598
between you and
I, please. Of course.

167
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:52,782
I'm really good with secrets.

168
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,469
I've kept Eliot's fear of
butterflies a secret for years.

169
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:57,971
Until now. Shit.

170
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:00,012
Sorry, I won't do that
with you. Pregnant.

171
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:06,884
Made macarons, mango yuzu

172
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,980
and matcha, anyone? Why?

173
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:14,792
For sustenance? You'll love
them. Nice try, Hoberman.

174
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:17,490
We're on mission. So,
no distractions. Out.

175
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,121
Sorry for interrupting.

176
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,465
Can you believe that guy?

177
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,803
What are you talking about?
You eat matcha everything.

178
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,844
Those macarons were a
trap. Josh is an emotional ninja.

179
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,813
He comes at you with sweets,
and then you just confess things.

180
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:40,586
So you're still avoiding that conversation
you owe him about leaving him in the past.

181
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,327
That is not going to be a good
talk, so we're not going to have it.

182
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,001
We have real
things to worry about,

183
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,469
like how you're going to find
out the Dark King's secret.

184
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:48,325
And we can't enjoy

185
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:50,887
mango yuzu macarons
while we worry about that?

186
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,592
Never take the food, Eliot.

187
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,594
Which gives me an idea.

188
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:02,535
Seb? I brought you something.

189
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:03,609
Oh, boy.

190
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,342
Oh, my God.

191
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,714
Um, are you okay?

192
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,250
Six children.

193
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,147
Six children taken.

194
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,919
It's my fault.

195
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,791
If I had been there, I
could've stopped them.

196
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,928
Being a king,

197
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,100
nobody knows
what it's really like.

198
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:33,598
Seb,

199
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,705
do you think you
could ever step down?

200
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:42,914
I have to be King. You
don't have to be anything.

201
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,410
I could help you.

202
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,984
Eliot. I appreciate your concern

203
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,087
more than I can say.

204
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:59,123
This is my burden.

205
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:03,067
I can't leave. Is it
something we can fix?

206
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,429
A spell, or a curse
of some kind?

207
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:10,101
A choice I made a long time ago.

208
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:13,976
Tied to a conduit.

209
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,411
I thought it was the only
way I could save Fillory.

210
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:18,850
A conduit? What do you mean?

211
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,978
It was a lifetime ago.

212
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,618
So many lifetimes ago.

213
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,423
We could just get out of here.

214
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,328
We could just go
camping, or, um...

215
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:05,597
I'm sorry.

216
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,366
I forgot myself.

217
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,463
Look, Seb, we
can make this okay.

218
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:14,371
Perhaps we shouldn't
see each other again.

219
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:37,194
Sorry, Ray. Got to test you
for spine-burrowing spiders.

220
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,263
You know the drill.

221
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,189
Chew, don't swallow.

222
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:47,697
Your <i>Primula scotica
isobelae</i> is flourishing, Baxie.

223
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,173
Spit.

224
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,003
Everyone's panties untwisted?

225
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,411
Because it turned purple?

226
00:11:56,516 --> 00:12:00,578
Purple is good, uncontrollably
shitting spiders is bad.

227
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:04,482
Ray, what do you make
of... All right, Glasses.

228
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:08,255
I'm going to say a word that
you don't know. Phyllotaxis.

229
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:10,523
The arrangement of
leaves around a central stalk.

230
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:12,225
Oh-ho-ho, you're one of those.

231
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:15,735
Hmm, says the arrogant, dime-a-dozen
academic with a plant fetish.

232
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,715
But later, when you
recount how you told me off,

233
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,890
I'm sure you'll punch it up
to be more of a dick chop.

234
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:21,673
It looks chaotic, but it's not.

235
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,300
It follows a
mathematical sequence.

236
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,311
The leaves of this plant suggest
that its origin is exceptionally exotic.

237
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,937
Or it is just a made-up drawing.

238
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:29,047
To an amateur,

239
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,155
I could see that being the
easiest explanation, yes.

240
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,311
But, no, no. This has something.

241
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,514
Plants, they have a certain integrity
to them. Mmm, it's hard to fake that.

242
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,251
Do you think you
can identify it?

243
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,589
Only guy who can. Mmm, joy.

244
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,127
Would you be a
sweetie and get me

245
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:44,424
a spectral-reactive phytometer,

246
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,691
a Bertric lens

247
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,256
and a pamplemousse LaCroix.

248
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,326
Happy to. No. If I
stay, I might kill him.

249
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,508
The Dark King is immortal
because of a conduit?

250
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:08,179
Like a vitality conduit?
Do we know what that is?

251
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:10,790
I guess not.

252
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:13,790
It's an old naturalist ritual.

253
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:17,591
Draw life force from a stalk
of corn to fight a summer cold.

254
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:20,190
That sort of thing. Seb's
immortality comes from corn?

255
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,759
What about a tree? He
had a tattoo of one with...

256
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,964
Looked like maple
leaves, only more jagged.

257
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:27,072
Oh!

258
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:28,731
You can just talk.

259
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:30,834
That's a blackwood tree.

260
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:34,542
Okay, so, what if we locate the tree
from Seb's tattoo and chop it down?

261
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:37,683
Would that sever this
conduit? In theory, yes.

262
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:40,845
He would be mortal,
and 100% stab-able.

263
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:42,682
So, how do we find this tree?

264
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:45,691
Who has two thumbs and
aced their elective in dowsing?

265
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,319
Probably safer to
send two of us, though.

266
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,462
Just in case
something goes wrong.

267
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:54,228
Well, I'm a former tree goddess.

268
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,996
I'll go. No.

269
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:57,569
You can't go on a long hike

270
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,139
because you have the toe worms.

271
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:03,572
Oh, right. My toe worms.

272
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,577
I thought that was
just a wooden toe thing.

273
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:09,547
You thought wrong. There's a lot
of misinformation about toe worms.

274
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:12,118
I have them. Are you
gonna make me take a hike?

275
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:17,715
No. No worm-shame here.
Okay, uh, how about you, Margo?

276
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,524
Could use your Centurion skills

277
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,494
with all the Takers out there.

278
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:25,162
If you do that, it'll just leave
me. And I kind of have a problem.

279
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:28,267
After our last talk, Seb told
me to stay away from him.

280
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:32,066
So I don't really think I'm in a
position to, you know, stab him.

281
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:34,312
Yeah, but what if he needs you?

282
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:36,334
You're his Magician advisor.

283
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:39,675
Fen and I will come up with a
problem that takes two Magicians to fix,

284
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:41,908
assuming our toes can handle it.

285
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,079
It'll be touch and go.

286
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:48,348
Okay, but what if the
Dark King can feel it

287
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:51,255
when we chop down the tree,
and we have to act quickly?

288
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:54,521
I just don't know how quick
I can be, given everything.

289
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:57,462
Don't worry. We'll make it work.

290
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,891
The fuck, Margo? You promised.

291
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,597
And I meant it. You won't
be the one to kill Seb, exactly.

292
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:07,449
Why are you being so
weird and tricky about this?

293
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,066
I thought I was clear.

294
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,871
Wait.

295
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:13,912
Mmm.

296
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:18,117
That is the worst mojito
I've ever had in my entire life.

297
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:21,244
That's because, not
a mojito. It's a potion.

298
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,087
I was going to explain before you
got all grabby. But I guess here we go.

299
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,060
Oh.

300
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:33,223
Seb needs to die. You
can't do it, but I can.

301
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,928
So, get ready to...
Ovary up, bitch.

302
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,374
Margo, did we
just <i>Freaky Friday?</i>

303
00:15:56,255 --> 00:15:57,484
Bax.

304
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:04,263
What did you do to
him? He's fine. He's fine.

305
00:16:04,997 --> 00:16:06,295
Give me my page back.

306
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,531
Look, I will buy it from
you. Name your price.

307
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,332
Put it down, now.

308
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:23,843
Holy shit.

309
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:27,681
I just pushed him. It
shouldn't have done that.

310
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:36,523
What the hell was that?
We need to seal this room.

311
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:43,034
Jesus, Bambi. That was
kind of non-consensual.

312
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,831
You drank before
I could explain.

313
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:47,430
I've been trying to figure
out how to help you.

314
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:48,884
This is the only
way I could think of

315
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:51,309
to keep your hands
clean of Seb's murder.

316
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,903
Except they literally won't
be. Those are my hands.

317
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,457
Look, you're the one
who can get close.

318
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:57,541
I'm the one with
the will to stab.

319
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:02,812
El, I love you, but we
have to do this thing.

320
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,551
Even you agree with that.

321
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,757
This is the best compromise
I could come up with.

322
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,394
So, listen up. This
spell's got a little quirk

323
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:13,738
you should probably know about.

324
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,864
Tell anyone we've swapped and
we won't be able to swap back.

325
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:20,873
Permanently. That
is good to know.

326
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:28,145
Strange. It's like you're
Eliot. But not Eliot.

327
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,046
Oh, my God, you're
seeing Charlton.

328
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,947
What kind of a name is Charlton?

329
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,314
Family name. I never liked it.

330
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,014
He lives in my
head... Your head.

331
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,079
And why is there a
man living in your head?

332
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:40,023
Charlton and I were
Monster victims together.

333
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:43,688
He stayed in my head when
you pulled The Monster out.

334
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:45,254
I held on real tight.

335
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:48,630
So if he's in your head,
why didn't he swap with you?

336
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,966
I have no idea. Honestly,
this is all very new.

337
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,905
I'd have given you a
heads-up if I'd known your plan.

338
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:58,570
Listen, Charlie, stay
the fuck out of my way.

339
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:02,638
Hey, Bambi, before you go
all Bambi and scare him off,

340
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,809
why don't you maybe
let him help you?

341
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,752
I've managed just fine without a
Tyler Durden on my cooch. Thanks.

342
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:12,451
I'm just saying, this Seb
situation is pretty complicated.

343
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:16,893
You're not exactly a
subtle relationship person.

344
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:18,276
From what I've seen, he's right.

345
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,791
You've got to ride a really
fine line with the Dark King.

346
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:25,736
He lost his love,
but he likes me.

347
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:27,740
So, that feels like a betrayal.

348
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:30,003
That is a lot of drama to track.

349
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,135
What about you and Josh?

350
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:35,578
Since I'll be going on a long
walk to cut down a tree with him,

351
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,840
is there anything I should know?

352
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,182
Yeah. If Josh tries to pull
you into any kind of talk,

353
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,983
just don't.

354
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:58,635
I was a little surprised to get
your message after our last convo.

355
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:02,438
I know things got complicated.

356
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,636
But circumstances have changed.

357
00:19:04,744 --> 00:19:08,203
The castle has been struck
with a strange sleeping curse.

358
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,612
Is that what happened to...

359
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:11,783
Wow.

360
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:14,182
We've kept it quiet.

361
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:17,745
Obviously it requires
a magical solution,

362
00:19:17,857 --> 00:19:19,057
but I'm afraid it's beyond me.

363
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:25,128
I think I know this curse.
Good news, there's a cure.

364
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:28,793
Only prob, it takes a bit
of cooperative spell work.

365
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:31,804
You need four
hands to do it. I see.

366
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:32,948
So, you want to solve this,

367
00:19:32,972 --> 00:19:34,049
we're gonna have
to work together,

368
00:19:34,073 --> 00:19:36,440
even if it makes you
uncomf or whatevs.

369
00:19:37,209 --> 00:19:38,336
You sound strange.

370
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:44,683
I haven't been feeling
myself since our last talk.

371
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:46,084
Yes.

372
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:51,884
Let us work together to
solve this curious malady

373
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:53,186
for the good of Fillory.

374
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:56,726
That could have gone smoother.

375
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:14,641
Sleeping pollen worked like
a charm. Or a curse, I guess.

376
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:17,079
Oh, Umber's balls!

377
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:21,018
Margo just keeps leaving
her uniform lying around.

378
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:24,285
Makes me feel
like a maid. Right.

379
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:28,691
Julia, let me take over.
Rest is good for the baby.

380
00:20:29,028 --> 00:20:31,520
Not a baby. Still baking.

381
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:36,297
But it'll become a baby. You
do know how this works, right?

382
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:39,372
Look, Fen. I just
want to live my life

383
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:41,930
without this defining
every aspect of it.

384
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,976
You get me? Okay,
well, if that's the truth,

385
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,942
then why haven't you
done something about it?

386
00:20:46,045 --> 00:20:48,913
It's not a hard
procedure, even in Fillory.

387
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:51,951
You think I should abort it? I'm
saying you should make a choice.

388
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:57,688
You're letting something into
your life that you can't control,

389
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:59,851
and in lots of ways
will control you.

390
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:04,229
It'll make you happy
or devastate you.

391
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:07,632
Hey.

392
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:13,400
Look, I've been pregnant
before, and it was really bad.

393
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,565
And I knew this time if
I told everyone about it,

394
00:21:16,642 --> 00:21:19,476
they'd get worried and
overprotective, and I...

395
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:21,911
I just wanted to take one
of the next nine months

396
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:25,577
to feel like maybe this time,

397
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:27,186
it wouldn't be so
terrible, you know?

398
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:30,456
Nine months? What...
What are you talking about?

399
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:33,049
It's Red Monkey Month.
Red Monkey what?

400
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,788
Everything goes faster
in Red Monkey Month.

401
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:37,523
Healing, crop growth.

402
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:39,760
Weirdly, not monkeys.

403
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:40,909
I'm sorry, are you saying that

404
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:42,959
my pregnancy is
going to be sped up?

405
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:46,163
Julia, it already is, as
long as you stay in Fillory.

406
00:21:46,272 --> 00:21:48,332
Oh, Jesus Christ.

407
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:59,183
Get the fuck away
from me! What's wrong?

408
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:00,446
I thought I saw a butterfly.

409
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:03,851
You never know where
they're gonna go next.

410
00:22:04,757 --> 00:22:07,488
Lavender rose macaron? I
know they're your favorite.

411
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:11,292
I'd better not. Margo,
it's a snack, not a trap.

412
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,138
You're a really good baker.

413
00:22:21,207 --> 00:22:23,301
Also, taller from this POV.

414
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:26,236
I learned to dial in that recipe
while I was stuck in the past.

415
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,179
Fen had her
knives. I had baking.

416
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:31,682
Oh, yeah. That must have
been tough for you both.

417
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:33,650
It was, I mean...

418
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,230
Sorry, I didn't
mean to bring it up.

419
00:22:35,254 --> 00:22:36,586
We don't have to talk about it.

420
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,867
Okay. How much further
you think... It's just, we thought

421
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:41,690
we lost you guys, and
it was a scary time, so...

422
00:22:41,794 --> 00:22:44,195
So we must be getting
near Seb's tree, huh?

423
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:45,788
Are we really not gonna do this?

424
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:49,431
Look, I'd be lying if I
said that it didn't hurt

425
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,401
when you wanted to
abandon me in the past,

426
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:53,802
but I know it wasn't about me.

427
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:57,002
Still, Margo, I have to ask,
do you want to break up?

428
00:22:57,076 --> 00:22:59,875
I mean, are we even a
thing that can be broken up?

429
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:01,140
I, uh...

430
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:03,046
What do you think?

431
00:23:04,016 --> 00:23:06,451
Sometimes I feel like
that's what you want.

432
00:23:06,552 --> 00:23:08,885
Look, when we got together,
I said I wasn't into games.

433
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:10,308
And do you remember
what you said?

434
00:23:11,023 --> 00:23:12,023
Uh...

435
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:15,858
You said, "Fuck games."
That does sound like me.

436
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:18,227
I can accept it's over if
you just say the words.

437
00:23:18,297 --> 00:23:21,699
Josh, I want to talk, I
really do. But I can't,

438
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:29,867
except to say that maybe I need
a little more time to forgive myself.

439
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,609
Oh. Uh...

440
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:35,407
Really? Yes.

441
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:39,282
Because I've realized that deciding
to leave you in the past was a mistake.

442
00:23:39,385 --> 00:23:43,584
A big one. And now I need
to earn your forgiveness,

443
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:45,215
which may take a while.

444
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:49,251
So we can kind of keep things
status quo in the meantime.

445
00:23:49,328 --> 00:23:53,561
I... Sure, sure. Great.

446
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,132
Now, which way to the tree?

447
00:23:55,234 --> 00:23:56,258
Uh...

448
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:06,502
I think Ray was
hosting a symbiote.

449
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,843
He was possessed? Not possessed.

450
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,383
It's rare, but a few fungus
species have been known

451
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,681
to join consciousness
with other creatures.

452
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:16,483
You're still you. You just
share brain power, thoughts.

453
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:19,581
And then you explode?
Well, I'm not a mushroom guy,

454
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:23,595
but I think that's because Ray merged
with the fungus a long, long time ago.

455
00:24:23,662 --> 00:24:27,463
Is he... It... Shit, are
they dead? Ray is.

456
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:30,469
But those particles that came
out of him were fungal spores.

457
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:32,437
They'll want a new host body.

458
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:34,063
I sealed them inside the lab,

459
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,139
but it might be a good
idea to close the air vents.

460
00:24:36,175 --> 00:24:38,269
Yeah, hi, new to this job.

461
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:40,184
I have no idea how to
control the school vents.

462
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,016
We need to evacuate. I knew I
should've trusted my instincts.

463
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,448
Hey. Hey, there's, um...

464
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:54,626
Eukaryotic phytosymbiont. Yeah,
there's a monster on the loose.

465
00:24:54,693 --> 00:24:57,822
Head to the Physical Kids'
cottage to be quarantined, now.

466
00:25:02,701 --> 00:25:05,569
Alice, give us the plant
page. And we'll stop spreading.

467
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:10,675
Whoa, whoa.

468
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:11,743
Okay.

469
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,807
New theory. The fungus
can spread to multiple hosts.

470
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:17,325
This might be a
zombie plague situation.

471
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,349
What? What?

472
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:29,389
I say this as the man
who blew up my Brakebills.

473
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:31,464
You're the worst goddamn
dean we've ever had.

474
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:35,023
Yeah, I'm not here for a
lecture from my prisoner.

475
00:25:35,134 --> 00:25:36,727
Just hiding from spores.

476
00:25:37,002 --> 00:25:39,767
Oh, so you remembered that
this room is hermetically sealed,

477
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:42,171
but not to consult
the "Do Not Admit" list.

478
00:25:42,241 --> 00:25:44,403
I did everything a
dean is supposed to do.

479
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:47,309
A dean is supposed
to have strong instincts.

480
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,543
Like knowing anyone who'd
visit Anansia is also insane enough

481
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:54,781
to visit other worlds with
infections for which we cannot test.

482
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:56,321
Do you want to help, or what?

483
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,789
Yes, I can provide a solution

484
00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:01,053
in exchange for my release.

485
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,890
How do we know
you really have one?

486
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:06,090
I developed a potion
with a Dr. Maria Pilkin.

487
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:08,064
You can check with her,

488
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:12,429
but she died in this timeline.

489
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:17,699
No deal. We'll find our own way.

490
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:20,336
You cannot save your
students without my help.

491
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,940
See, in our timeline,
Pilkin's work was published

492
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:26,746
after her death.
So, it's in our library.

493
00:26:28,821 --> 00:26:30,983
Gave away your leverage.

494
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:34,215
Thought a dean was supposed
to have strong instincts.

495
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:37,263
I will get out of here,

496
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:41,891
and then, I'll turn you
into lobsters and eat you.

497
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:43,801
Okay.

498
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,375
Okay, the book we
need is right there.

499
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,919
See any twitching? Just
assume they're all infected.

500
00:27:00,986 --> 00:27:02,648
And assume they're
all looking for us.

501
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:04,314
It's too risky for us
to go in together.

502
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,558
I know where it is. I'll go.

503
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:10,018
Hey. Remember, magic is
unpredictable outside the lab.

504
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,961
So, no phosphoromancy.

505
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:15,159
Good thing I have experience
being invisible from high school.

506
00:28:25,671 --> 00:28:28,334
You got us the book and
a guinea pig. Nice work.

507
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:31,469
It said the potion
should work fast.

508
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:45,720
Penny. BAX: Oh, shit.

509
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:47,120
Penny.

510
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:51,029
Just give up the page, Alice.

511
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,729
Come on.

512
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:05,500
Almost ready. Great.

513
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,037
Margo, you have to
draw this out, you know.

514
00:29:09,114 --> 00:29:10,794
The second they wake,
Seb will dismiss you.

515
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:13,978
No shit, Sherlock. This is all
part of my plan to win him over.

516
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:17,318
How is finishing the ritual early,
and in silence, part of your plan?

517
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,516
Because I taught
it to him wrong.

518
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,390
So, to fix it, I'm gonna have
to get real close and personal.

519
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:23,861
Eliot?

520
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,074
Something in the middle
section doesn't feel right.

521
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,709
The energies aren't
moving as they should.

522
00:29:27,733 --> 00:29:28,733
Mmm.

523
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:30,701
I can walk you through it.

524
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:39,134
Wait.

525
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:40,978
That's not right.

526
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,747
Here.

527
00:29:50,756 --> 00:29:55,091
We should keep our distance.
It will make things easier.

528
00:29:55,661 --> 00:29:58,130
Right. Of course.

529
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:02,365
If you need my help, just ask.

530
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:05,437
Jesus' clit! I know how
to work a guy, Charlton.

531
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:09,498
Yes, you do. Margo. But as
Eliot, you're coming on too strong.

532
00:30:09,608 --> 00:30:12,134
Seb likes Eliot's
vulnerability. Don't be pushy.

533
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:14,145
Just open up.

534
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,443
He and Eliot are close
because of the losses they share.

535
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,148
I can show you the
rest if you're ready,

536
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:29,160
but first, I think I owe you an
apology. Eliot, that's not necessary.

537
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:32,686
It's just, I haven't felt this
way in a really long time.

538
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:35,857
I think the fact that we both...

539
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:39,670
It just felt safe with
you, you know?

540
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:43,673
On that mountain,
we both felt it.

541
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,304
There's nothing wrong
with wanting more.

542
00:30:47,713 --> 00:30:51,411
I wish I could give you
more, but I just can't.

543
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:55,213
I must put Fillory first,
even if it means I suffer.

544
00:30:57,055 --> 00:30:59,047
I do hope you understand that.

545
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:02,861
I get it. It's hard to be King.

546
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:05,792
People don't know
what you go through.

547
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:12,864
Now, let me show you
how to do that spell correctly.

548
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:30,019
Are we close to the tree?

549
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:32,023
I don't mean to rush.
You're the expert.

550
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:35,060
Okay, that's it.
I'm not buying it.

551
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,755
Not buying what? Any of this.

552
00:31:37,863 --> 00:31:41,300
Emotional, agreeable,
patient? You're not Margo.

553
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,698
Who else would I be?

554
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:47,103
This is Fillory. I don't know.
You could be a hallucination,

555
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:50,175
or a shapeshifter, or an
agent of the Dark King.

556
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:53,268
But I'm not. Josh, I'm...

557
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:56,840
Shit. I wish I could explain.

558
00:31:56,915 --> 00:32:02,752
Oh, well, until you do, I'm not
taking you to the tree. Got it?

559
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:13,922
The antifungal kind of worked.

560
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:15,227
We got the spores out of him.

561
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,893
Yeah, and into Penny.

562
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:19,028
It must be the fungus's
networking ability.

563
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:20,424
Long as it's alive
in other hosts,

564
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:22,634
it can still direct its spores
into whoever it wants.

565
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:24,903
So why not into us?
We were right there.

566
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:27,969
Uh, Penny was closer? I
thought you were an expert.

567
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,516
I told you this isn't my area.
At this point, my best advice?

568
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,847
Give the fungus
what it wants. No.

569
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,822
Ever since I found this
page, I knew it was important.

570
00:32:37,923 --> 00:32:41,826
If the fungus wants it, I was
right. I have to know what it means.

571
00:32:41,927 --> 00:32:43,589
Is it worth dying over?

572
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:46,427
Is that what Quentin would
want? For you to die too?

573
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:48,228
Back the fuck up, botanist.

574
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:53,236
Sorry. Maybe I
overstepped. It's just...

575
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:58,336
Remember that plant I put
on the window sill in the lab?

576
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:00,071
Yeah, you only
screamed at me about it.

577
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:02,080
Scottish Primrose.

578
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:04,616
It's this fragile little flower.
Even grass can kill it.

579
00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:08,085
So it has to survive on cliff
walls where nothing else can.

580
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:11,146
It was my wife
Isobel's favorite.

581
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,987
<i>Primula scotica isobelae.</i>
You named it after her?

582
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:19,655
You remembered the name.

583
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:24,428
She loved that stupid flower.

584
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:26,165
Kept it alive without
any spell work.

585
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:31,369
Huge point of pride that I
thought was just kind of silly.

586
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:37,346
Then she died. So
now I keep it alive.

587
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:39,978
If it's anything like that,

588
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:42,646
I get why you'd want
to keep that page.

589
00:33:45,924 --> 00:33:47,222
How long ago?

590
00:33:47,926 --> 00:33:52,489
Five years. You? A lot less.

591
00:33:53,999 --> 00:33:59,199
So, how long until, you know, it
feels less like it's eating all of you?

592
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:01,067
I'm kind of still waiting.

593
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:04,374
I just feel like I'm going to be

594
00:34:04,476 --> 00:34:07,036
this walking
whatever I am forever.

595
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:08,704
I did, too.

596
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,476
It starts like this tight
ball in your chest,

597
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:15,020
but over time, it gets lighter

598
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:18,784
because it just kind of
spreads into the rest of you.

599
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,689
It's like your own
personal symbiote.

600
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,255
Yeah, kind of.
Except not murderous

601
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:28,196
and weirdly paper-focused.

602
00:34:28,867 --> 00:34:32,269
Just, uh, sad.

603
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:34,729
Yeah.

604
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,806
Make it to a year.

605
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:43,439
It'll still suck, but
it gets quieter.

606
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:44,572
I promise.

607
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:56,585
Shit. I know what to do.

608
00:35:02,567 --> 00:35:03,567
Damn.

609
00:35:04,002 --> 00:35:07,268
I actually felt bad for him.
For what he's been through.

610
00:35:07,372 --> 00:35:10,103
He's a nice man,
but an evil king.

611
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:14,010
It doesn't make
sense. He seems kind.

612
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,240
He seems sad.

613
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:20,481
Why the fuck would he summon
those monsters into Fillory?

614
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:25,721
Eliot, I think we're
finished. It worked.

615
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:29,758
Before you go,
perhaps we should talk.

616
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:34,642
I don't know why
he summoned them,

617
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:37,500
but I don't think we're going
to get another chance at this.

618
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:52,846
Not as easy as it
looks, is it? Josh, please.

619
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:54,191
Eliot's waiting for the signal.

620
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:55,429
If we don't chop down the tree,

621
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:58,446
he's screwed. We're screwed.
You said you wish you could explain.

622
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:00,992
That means there's something
to explain. So explain.

623
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:04,757
So you've been wanting to talk to me for
weeks about what happened between us.

624
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,593
But when I finally apologize,

625
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:08,890
you accuse me of
being possessed.

626
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,595
Right. Apologize. Does
that sound like Margo to you?

627
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:15,903
Fine! Maybe I was saying what you
wanted to hear 'cause you never let up.

628
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:18,419
You keep trying to get
me to talk about something

629
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:19,809
I don't want to talk about.

630
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:24,342
Okay, fine. I get that. You
want to know the truth?

631
00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:26,127
You picked someone
who will never put you first.

632
00:36:26,151 --> 00:36:28,677
There's no fixing
Margo. I mean, me.

633
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:32,349
Because chances are if I had to
relive it, I'd make the same decision.

634
00:36:32,457 --> 00:36:37,020
So, stop asking me to apologize
for something I don't feel sorry about.

635
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:41,025
Now you sound like you.

636
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:44,666
Not that I won't feel
differently tomorrow.

637
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:48,639
No. You won't.
You're very clear.

638
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,832
The conduit tree's
that one over there.

639
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:53,572
Cut it down. I'll give
Eliot the green light.

640
00:36:54,479 --> 00:36:56,175
Oh, God.

641
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:00,712
I'm fine here. Go help
the others search the castle

642
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:03,186
for any remaining victims
of the sleeping curse.

643
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:12,560
What you said last night,

644
00:37:13,031 --> 00:37:14,363
did you mean it?

645
00:37:14,432 --> 00:37:15,593
Um...

646
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:20,596
Oh, right. Eliot asked Seb if
he'd consider giving up the throne.

647
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:22,765
He even offered to help
him, but Seb said no.

648
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:24,968
Eliot? Are you all right?

649
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:28,911
Yes, sorry. Of
course I meant it.

650
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:31,940
Because I've been thinking...

651
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:34,061
Margo, the candles.
That's the signal.

652
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,553
They cut down Seb's tree.

653
00:37:36,054 --> 00:37:38,285
- Eliot?
- It's now or never.

654
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:46,856
Eliot should be done by now.

655
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,932
Well, they're in a hurry.
Oh, gods, we're in trouble.

656
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:55,165
Here, take my extra knife.

657
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,742
All the knives in the world
won't get us past the Centurions.

658
00:37:57,809 --> 00:37:59,300
Do you have a better plan?

659
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:03,879
Are you under a hex? A
witch's spell? What's going on?

660
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:06,713
I can explain. Just...

661
00:38:07,085 --> 00:38:09,145
There will be serious
consequences if I do.

662
00:38:09,254 --> 00:38:11,298
No, you can't tell him,
Margo. You'll be stuck in there.

663
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:13,791
There will be serious
consequences if you don't explain.

664
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,515
You asked, and I'm here.

665
00:38:48,026 --> 00:38:50,655
So, you gonna give up the page,

666
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:52,094
or make us spore you, too?

667
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,568
I'll give it to you

668
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,465
if you tell me why you want it.

669
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,405
It's an instruction
manual. For what?

670
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:08,969
The World Seed. It's a
magical botanical organism.

671
00:39:09,047 --> 00:39:11,573
Legend is, the seed
is pure potential.

672
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:15,381
With the right nurturing, it
can grow into almost anything.

673
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:17,011
Even an entire world.

674
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:20,955
Well, if you want the page, does
that mean you already have the seed?

675
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,687
We're done talking.

676
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:37,504
Alice, what are you doing to us?

677
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:40,977
Me? I'm just
keeping you talking.

678
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:42,911
All that shared brainpower,

679
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:46,212
and you never thought to
yourselves, "Where's Bax?"

680
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:49,597
<i>I mean, you had us
stumped for a while.</i>

681
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:52,056
<i>It seemed like if we
got you out of one host,</i>

682
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:54,034
<i>you'd just keep spreading
yourself to other ones.</i>

683
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,356
<i>But you didn't.</i>

684
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:58,386
For some reason, you
were limiting yourself.

685
00:39:58,463 --> 00:40:01,092
<i>Some of your spores
didn't try to spread.</i>

686
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:05,694
<i>Bax wasn't sure why, because
fungi can typically grow and grow.</i>

687
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:10,072
<i>But you're also a
consciousness, like us.</i>

688
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:17,643
<i>And we have limits. Try to juggle
too much at once, and we're useless.</i>

689
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:19,093
- It's a professor thing.
- What?

690
00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:20,449
Just go with it.

691
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:24,579
<i>So I have Bax spreading
you too thin to affect your hosts</i>

692
00:40:24,656 --> 00:40:26,625
mentally or physically.

693
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:30,655
You won't be able to
control them anymore.

694
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:33,630
You're killing me.
No, don't worry.

695
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:36,428
You'll be a part of
your host forever.

696
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:39,060
You're just getting quieter.

697
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:56,921
This is the worst
fucking job ever.

698
00:40:57,655 --> 00:40:59,749
Penny? Are you okay?

699
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:04,957
Found your page. Do you
know why you wanted it?

700
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:09,658
It's fading, but to sell.

701
00:41:11,169 --> 00:41:14,105
There was this huge debt to pay.

702
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:17,973
I don't know what for, but
when the Couple came to collect,

703
00:41:18,076 --> 00:41:20,545
we didn't... They didn't
ask any questions.

704
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:25,113
A couple of... No, the Couple.

705
00:41:26,184 --> 00:41:29,177
Weird name, but I remember
feeling scared shitless.

706
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:33,484
The Couple has
power, it has resources.

707
00:41:35,093 --> 00:41:37,528
It's been looking for the
World Seed page a long time,

708
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:39,187
and they are not good people.

709
00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:42,193
And they know I
have what they want.

710
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:45,473
I don't think that's gonna be the
last person or thing to come after it.

711
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:50,534
What the hell was Coldwater
doing with instructions

712
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:52,200
to something so powerful?

713
00:41:52,744 --> 00:41:53,744
Yeah.

714
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,171
I have no idea.

715
00:41:59,584 --> 00:42:01,678
Jesus Christ, El,
you had one job,

716
00:42:01,753 --> 00:42:04,382
don't blow up my relationship
with Josh. And what did you do?

717
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:07,357
I'm sorry, there was no way
to avoid that conversation.

718
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:10,724
He's just so goddamn persistent.

719
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:14,287
Tell me about it. By the by,
Charlton's gonna go hang out

720
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,856
in your beach
memories for a while.

721
00:42:16,501 --> 00:42:18,333
Think the whole Seb
thing was hard on him.

722
00:42:18,403 --> 00:42:23,171
So, um, what did you and Seb
talk about, you know, before?

723
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:26,905
Don't do this to yourself.
I ended your relationship.

724
00:42:27,011 --> 00:42:29,173
Seems like I deserve
whatever pain's coming my way.

725
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:31,473
That wasn't your fault.

726
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:35,379
You were just dealing with some
shit I set up way before you took over.

727
00:42:35,753 --> 00:42:38,382
So, in summation,
we're both equally skilled

728
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:40,185
at destroying our own happiness.

729
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:45,428
Yeah, well, at least we
used our powers for good.

730
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:49,533
How fucked up is
it that I miss him?

731
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,695
El, there's nothing
wrong with you.

732
00:42:53,805 --> 00:42:55,171
He was hot and complicated.

733
00:42:55,273 --> 00:42:56,935
Those are the
ones worth banging.

734
00:42:57,809 --> 00:42:59,334
You've just had some shitty luck

735
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,776
with boys so far, that's all.

736
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:02,938
It doesn't mean you
don't deserve love,

737
00:43:03,047 --> 00:43:04,982
or that you won't ever find it.

738
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:09,582
Well, at least I have
better luck with friends.
