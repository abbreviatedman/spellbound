1
00:00:06,397 --> 00:00:08,312
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:08,356 --> 00:00:09,487
I see blood on the walls.

3
00:00:09,531 --> 00:00:10,793
I hear its voice.

4
00:00:10,836 --> 00:00:12,273
It wants out.

5
00:00:12,316 --> 00:00:13,424
Have you tried letting it out?

6
00:00:13,448 --> 00:00:14,753
Charlton?

7
00:00:14,797 --> 00:00:17,191
I once was possessed
by the Monster too.

8
00:00:17,234 --> 00:00:19,106
When all the scary creatures
were pulled out,

9
00:00:19,149 --> 00:00:21,151
I held on tight as I could
in your happy place.

10
00:00:21,195 --> 00:00:24,328
I found this
in Q's stuff at Brakebills.

11
00:00:24,372 --> 00:00:25,547
Professor?

12
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,766
I mean... Dean Adiyodi?

13
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,333
Yeah, come in.

14
00:00:29,377 --> 00:00:31,074
What did you do with Fogg 17?

15
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:33,120
I call that one Psycho Fogg.

16
00:00:33,163 --> 00:00:35,383
- Put him in the clean room.
- He can't cast there, so.

17
00:00:35,426 --> 00:00:36,645
I can't do what I need to do

18
00:00:36,688 --> 00:00:38,734
if I'm worried about
how it's gonna affect you.

19
00:00:38,777 --> 00:00:40,257
I think we need to be done.

20
00:00:40,301 --> 00:00:41,713
I'm interviewing
for the botany job.

21
00:00:41,737 --> 00:00:43,217
Hamish Bax.

22
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,654
If I'm right, this should
adjust circumstances

23
00:00:45,697 --> 00:00:47,090
in the entire greenhouse,

24
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:48,744
allowing us to cast.

25
00:00:48,787 --> 00:00:51,399
You risked everything for us.

26
00:00:51,442 --> 00:00:53,357
The least we can do
is to show you the truth.

27
00:01:08,546 --> 00:01:12,202
You can't outrun me!

28
00:01:31,961 --> 00:01:33,789
- Six children taken.
- It's horrific.

29
00:01:33,832 --> 00:01:35,878
- The Takers are swarming.
- It's my fault.

30
00:01:36,792 --> 00:01:39,490
They're swarming because Seb
summoned them with a spell

31
00:01:39,534 --> 00:01:41,362
using the gold I gave him.

32
00:01:41,405 --> 00:01:43,233
I didn't know
what he was gonna do with it.

33
00:01:43,277 --> 00:01:46,584
The Takers...
That's how he stays in power.

34
00:01:46,628 --> 00:01:48,760
He summons them
and only he can fight them.

35
00:01:48,804 --> 00:01:50,153
Jesus.

36
00:01:50,197 --> 00:01:51,783
I go away to my nephew's
bar mitzvah for one weekend

37
00:01:51,807 --> 00:01:53,243
and everything gets fercockt.

38
00:01:53,287 --> 00:01:54,244
What are we going to do?

39
00:01:54,288 --> 00:01:57,421
We gotta kill the Dark King.

40
00:01:57,465 --> 00:01:59,249
What? We're all thinking it.

41
00:01:59,293 --> 00:02:02,383
Eli's Torah portion was
all about the sanctity of life,

42
00:02:02,426 --> 00:02:04,254
and I found it very moving.

43
00:02:04,298 --> 00:02:08,171
So, can't we, I don't know,
peacefully overthrow him?

44
00:02:08,215 --> 00:02:09,912
No, we can't.

45
00:02:09,955 --> 00:02:13,611
He's got a Centurion army.
I should know. I'm one of 'em.

46
00:02:13,655 --> 00:02:15,396
Also 300 years of propaganda

47
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,721
convincing everyone
they need him.

48
00:02:16,745 --> 00:02:18,747
Also-also, 300 years?

49
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:22,185
We're talking a powerful,
immortal magician?

50
00:02:22,229 --> 00:02:24,405
Doubt you can just walk up
and stab the guy.

51
00:02:24,448 --> 00:02:26,233
I've been researching.

52
00:02:26,276 --> 00:02:28,211
The Dark King survived
seven assassination attempts

53
00:02:28,235 --> 00:02:29,497
since he took our thrones.

54
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,586
Must be big magic
keeping him alive.

55
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:33,762
We have to figure out
what it is.

56
00:02:33,805 --> 00:02:34,806
Find out his weakness.

57
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,286
You're on board with this too?

58
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,506
I mean, I'm here to stop
an apocalypse that happens

59
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:41,465
'cause an evil force invades
from a distant realm.

60
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:42,858
That sounds like the Takers.

61
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:44,294
Then it's settled.

62
00:02:44,338 --> 00:02:45,687
We kill the Dark King,

63
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,491
stop the Takers from pouring
in, stop the apocalypse.

64
00:02:47,515 --> 00:02:48,472
Who's in?

65
00:02:48,516 --> 00:02:50,866
Just a couple of Q's, like

66
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:52,670
how are we gonna get
close enough to the Dark King

67
00:02:52,694 --> 00:02:54,348
to learn his weakness
and assassinate him?

68
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:56,828
We're a cook, a maid,
a army grunt,

69
00:02:56,872 --> 00:02:59,309
a Julia, and a...

70
00:02:59,353 --> 00:03:01,355
Counselor/confidante.

71
00:03:01,398 --> 00:03:03,444
You gotta admit, El,
you're perfectly placed.

72
00:03:03,487 --> 00:03:04,793
Plus, he's always dismissing

73
00:03:04,836 --> 00:03:07,970
his guards when you come around.

74
00:03:08,013 --> 00:03:10,581
Why does me liking somebody
always end up with them dying?

75
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:12,496
You should
tell your friends, Eliot.

76
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,498
That I don't want
to save Fillory

77
00:03:14,542 --> 00:03:16,239
because I caught feelings?

78
00:03:16,283 --> 00:03:17,651
I'm saying
they should know how you feel

79
00:03:17,675 --> 00:03:19,895
before they try to make you
do something you regret.

80
00:03:19,938 --> 00:03:22,550
No, I'll just look selfish,
Charlton.

81
00:03:22,593 --> 00:03:24,552
And I'll still end up having
to do it.

82
00:03:24,595 --> 00:03:27,642
- Talking to somebody?
- Um...

83
00:03:27,685 --> 00:03:30,514
myself and psyching myself up.

84
00:03:30,558 --> 00:03:31,796
Fillory needs the Dark King dead

85
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,996
and I am the obvious inside man.

86
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:35,737
- You sound weird.
- You sound weird.

87
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,738
Okay.

88
00:03:36,781 --> 00:03:38,392
It's that Eliot.

89
00:03:38,435 --> 00:03:41,308
Uh, look,
I know I'm just the guy

90
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:43,024
who has to live inside your
tragic remembrances and all

91
00:03:43,048 --> 00:03:44,354
but I truly don't understand

92
00:03:44,398 --> 00:03:46,443
why you won't at least tell her.

93
00:03:46,487 --> 00:03:47,705
Margo.

94
00:03:47,749 --> 00:03:49,664
Look...

95
00:03:49,707 --> 00:03:51,448
I'm not sure I can
go through with this.

96
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:53,798
El, you have a crush
on a boy who's bad for you.

97
00:03:53,842 --> 00:03:55,017
Happens to all of us,

98
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,498
but how do we get crushes
out of our system?

99
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,543
Lots of drinking, pining,

100
00:03:59,587 --> 00:04:00,979
some detailed sex fantasies.

101
00:04:01,023 --> 00:04:01,980
No.

102
00:04:02,024 --> 00:04:03,504
We bang them out.

103
00:04:03,547 --> 00:04:05,332
Okay, that's great,

104
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,440
except for the part where now
I have to murder the guy

105
00:04:07,464 --> 00:04:08,900
I just hypothetically
slept with,

106
00:04:08,944 --> 00:04:10,400
which is a thing
that shouldn't really happen

107
00:04:10,424 --> 00:04:11,729
to a person more than once.

108
00:04:11,773 --> 00:04:12,904
El,

109
00:04:12,948 --> 00:04:15,429
Fillory does need this,

110
00:04:15,472 --> 00:04:17,605
so if you can't do it,
tell me now.

111
00:04:17,648 --> 00:04:22,566
I know he has to die,
but I don't hate him.

112
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,916
I don't. I can't.

113
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,831
I can't make
betraying Seb easier,

114
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,703
but let me help make it simpler.

115
00:04:29,965 --> 00:04:32,097
Say you didn't have
to kill him yourself.

116
00:04:32,141 --> 00:04:34,883
- But I'm the one with access.
- You just said it.

117
00:04:34,926 --> 00:04:36,624
You're also my best friend.

118
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:38,060
If you can find his weakness,

119
00:04:38,103 --> 00:04:39,907
I'll find a way you don't have
to be the one to do it,

120
00:04:39,931 --> 00:04:40,976
I promise.

121
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:42,847
How?

122
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:46,460
I have no fucking idea,

123
00:04:46,503 --> 00:04:48,679
but I'll figure it out
for you, okay?

124
00:04:50,464 --> 00:04:51,595
Okay.

125
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,130
You took the thing, the panel.

126
00:05:05,174 --> 00:05:06,741
You can't just...

127
00:05:06,784 --> 00:05:08,395
This is mass floricide.

128
00:05:08,438 --> 00:05:10,092
Sorry, I had
to bring the panel here

129
00:05:10,135 --> 00:05:12,399
so I could study it.

130
00:05:12,442 --> 00:05:14,792
Sorry, I can't hear you
over my plants dying.

131
00:05:15,532 --> 00:05:17,969
Is this a western-facing window?

132
00:05:18,013 --> 00:05:19,580
And how we have
a working classroom

133
00:05:19,623 --> 00:05:22,800
because, you know, school
for magicians, not flowers.

134
00:05:22,844 --> 00:05:25,499
Took the botany job 'cause
you fixed up the greenhouse.

135
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:27,675
Should've known you'd just
turn around and wreck it.

136
00:05:27,718 --> 00:05:29,459
Here, let me explain
how that feels.

137
00:05:29,503 --> 00:05:30,852
Hey!

138
00:05:33,202 --> 00:05:34,638
Wait, don't touch that.

139
00:05:34,682 --> 00:05:35,726
Huh.

140
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,921
Thick venation
through the leaves,

141
00:05:36,945 --> 00:05:38,729
and look at the asymmetry here.

142
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:40,427
Wait, do you recognize it?

143
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,429
Don't think it's terrestrial.

144
00:05:42,472 --> 00:05:43,908
You'd need
a classification expert

145
00:05:43,952 --> 00:05:45,823
with the right magical tools.

146
00:05:45,867 --> 00:05:48,652
I know a taxonomist
that's been around,

147
00:05:48,696 --> 00:05:50,741
you know, the multiverse.

148
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:53,004
Well, do you think
we can get him to come here?

149
00:05:53,048 --> 00:05:54,789
Don't see why not.

150
00:05:54,832 --> 00:05:56,791
I'll tell you why not.

151
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:59,620
Your pal Raylan is on
the dean's "Do Not Admit" list.

152
00:05:59,663 --> 00:06:01,119
- You're Acting Dean.
- Can't you just...

153
00:06:01,143 --> 00:06:02,405
Alice.

154
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:03,798
He's a botanist.

155
00:06:03,841 --> 00:06:05,016
Yes!

156
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,844
Who visited a world
called Anansia,

157
00:06:06,888 --> 00:06:08,716
home to some
highly infectious shit.

158
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,674
He's still alive, isn't he?

159
00:06:10,718 --> 00:06:12,676
Magical phytologists
do crazy shit,

160
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,504
but Ray's smart.

161
00:06:14,548 --> 00:06:18,116
I doubt he's carrying
anything... well, dangerous.

162
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,466
No offense,

163
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:21,139
but I'm gonna trust the file
with the red stamp.

164
00:06:21,163 --> 00:06:22,706
Look, the only place
on Earth right now

165
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,775
with magic stable enough
for Ray to examine it

166
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:26,821
is in our lab, thanks to me

167
00:06:26,864 --> 00:06:28,997
installing the Circumstances
Control Panel for you.

168
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,521
Don't you think figuring out
the deal with magic

169
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:33,523
is more important than
translating some page

170
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:36,483
you found about a plant?

171
00:06:36,526 --> 00:06:38,180
I found it in Quentin's desk.

172
00:06:41,662 --> 00:06:45,753
This thing, it makes no sense

173
00:06:45,796 --> 00:06:47,668
except it was important to Q,

174
00:06:47,711 --> 00:06:50,627
so maybe it's important
we figure out what it is.

175
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:58,113
If we test him thoroughly

176
00:06:58,156 --> 00:07:00,594
and he's clean,

177
00:07:00,637 --> 00:07:02,160
he can come.

178
00:07:10,168 --> 00:07:12,867
- Uh... hey, Fen.
- Yeah?

179
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,303
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

180
00:07:14,346 --> 00:07:18,786
Um, lately I've just been
feeling a little bit off.

181
00:07:18,829 --> 00:07:21,745
If we were on Earth,
I'd know what to do, but...

182
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:24,008
is there, like, a magic plant
or something out here

183
00:07:24,052 --> 00:07:27,011
that I can pee on
to find out if I'm...

184
00:07:27,055 --> 00:07:28,926
Pregnant!

185
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,493
Shit.

186
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:31,625
Sorry.

187
00:07:31,668 --> 00:07:32,776
God, I don't know
why I'm crying, just...

188
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,803
Babies, ahh!

189
00:07:35,846 --> 00:07:37,935
Um, do you know
what you're gonna do?

190
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:41,896
Um, I'm not so sure.

191
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:43,898
Do you want me
to send a bunny to Penny?

192
00:07:43,941 --> 00:07:47,728
Uh, Penny and I are just...

193
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:49,164
We're sort of in a weird place.

194
00:07:49,207 --> 00:07:50,731
Oh.

195
00:07:50,774 --> 00:07:53,211
Actually, until I've had
some time to process,

196
00:07:53,255 --> 00:07:54,798
I'd really appreciate
if we could keep this

197
00:07:54,822 --> 00:07:55,997
between you and I, please?

198
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,583
- Of course.
- I'm really good with secrets.

199
00:07:57,607 --> 00:08:01,089
I've kept Eliot's fear of
butterflies secret for years.

200
00:08:01,132 --> 00:08:02,873
Until now, shit!

201
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:04,068
Sorry, I won't do that with you.

202
00:08:04,092 --> 00:08:05,485
Pregnant.

203
00:08:08,357 --> 00:08:10,141
Made macarons.

204
00:08:10,185 --> 00:08:13,797
Mango yuzu and matcha. Anyone?

205
00:08:13,841 --> 00:08:15,669
Why?

206
00:08:15,712 --> 00:08:18,236
For sustenance? You love them.

207
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,673
Nice try, Hoberman.

208
00:08:19,716 --> 00:08:21,675
We're on mission,
so no distractions.

209
00:08:21,718 --> 00:08:22,763
Out.

210
00:08:22,806 --> 00:08:24,286
Sorry for interrupting.

211
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,466
Can you believe that guy?

212
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,749
- What are you talking about?
- You eat matcha everything.

213
00:08:32,773 --> 00:08:34,035
Those macarons were a trap.

214
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:35,602
Josh is an emotional ninja.

215
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:38,213
He comes at you with sweets,
and then you just

216
00:08:38,256 --> 00:08:39,693
confess things.

217
00:08:39,736 --> 00:08:43,348
So you're still avoiding
that conversation you owe him

218
00:08:43,392 --> 00:08:45,568
about leaving him in the past.

219
00:08:45,612 --> 00:08:46,676
That is not gonna
be a good talk,

220
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,789
so we're not gonna have it.

221
00:08:48,832 --> 00:08:50,312
We have real things
to worry about,

222
00:08:50,355 --> 00:08:51,898
like how you're gonna find out
the Dark King's secret.

223
00:08:51,922 --> 00:08:54,664
And we can't
enjoy mango yuzu macarons

224
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:55,796
while we worry about that?

225
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,842
Never take the food, Eliot.

226
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:02,585
Which gives me an idea.

227
00:09:04,718 --> 00:09:07,242
Seb, I brought you something.

228
00:09:08,939 --> 00:09:10,201
Oh, my God.

229
00:09:14,249 --> 00:09:16,643
Are you okay?

230
00:09:16,686 --> 00:09:18,993
Six children.

231
00:09:19,036 --> 00:09:22,692
Six children taken.

232
00:09:22,736 --> 00:09:24,389
It's my fault.

233
00:09:24,433 --> 00:09:27,349
If I'd have been there,
I could've stopped them.

234
00:09:27,392 --> 00:09:30,961
Being a king...

235
00:09:31,005 --> 00:09:33,094
Nobody knows
what it's really like.

236
00:09:37,402 --> 00:09:38,969
Seb...

237
00:09:40,841 --> 00:09:42,712
do you think you could ever
step down?

238
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,802
I have to be king.

239
00:09:45,846 --> 00:09:47,935
You don't have to be anything.

240
00:09:50,938 --> 00:09:52,287
I could help you.

241
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:59,903
Eliot, I appreciate your concern

242
00:09:59,947 --> 00:10:02,123
more than I can say.

243
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:05,082
This is my burden.

244
00:10:05,126 --> 00:10:06,736
I can't leave.

245
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,869
Is it something we can fix?

246
00:10:08,912 --> 00:10:11,262
A spell or a curse of some kind.

247
00:10:11,306 --> 00:10:13,264
A choice

248
00:10:13,308 --> 00:10:17,051
I made a long time ago,

249
00:10:17,094 --> 00:10:18,922
tied to a conduit.

250
00:10:18,966 --> 00:10:21,229
I thought it was the only way
I could save Fillory.

251
00:10:21,272 --> 00:10:23,840
A conduit? What do you mean?

252
00:10:23,884 --> 00:10:25,755
It was a lifetime ago.

253
00:10:27,322 --> 00:10:29,454
So many lifetimes ago.

254
00:10:35,765 --> 00:10:38,289
We could just get out of here.

255
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:42,163
We could
just go camping or, um...

256
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,670
I'm sorry.

257
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,021
I forgot myself.

258
00:11:15,849 --> 00:11:17,328
Look, Seb,
we can make this okay.

259
00:11:17,372 --> 00:11:19,287
Perhaps we shouldn't
see each other again.

260
00:11:37,784 --> 00:11:39,481
Sorry, Ray.

261
00:11:39,524 --> 00:11:41,613
I gotta test you
for spine-burrowing spiders.

262
00:11:41,657 --> 00:11:44,616
You know the drill.
Chew, don't swallow.

263
00:11:49,491 --> 00:11:52,189
Your Primula scotica isobelae
is flourishing, Baxie.

264
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:53,625
Spit.

265
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,848
Everyone's panties untwisted?

266
00:11:58,892 --> 00:12:00,763
Because it turned purple?

267
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:02,286
Purple is good,

268
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,767
uncontrollably shitting spiders
is bad.

269
00:12:04,811 --> 00:12:06,377
Ray, what do you make of...

270
00:12:06,421 --> 00:12:08,684
All right, Glasses.

271
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,426
I'm going to say a word
that you don't know.

272
00:12:11,469 --> 00:12:12,819
Phyllotaxis.

273
00:12:12,862 --> 00:12:14,840
The arrangement of leaves
around a central stalk.

274
00:12:14,864 --> 00:12:16,648
Oh, you're one of those?

275
00:12:16,692 --> 00:12:18,607
Says the arrogant,
dime-a-dozen academic

276
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,217
with a plant fetish.

277
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:21,804
But later when you recount
how you told me off,

278
00:12:21,828 --> 00:12:24,613
I'm sure you'll punch it up
to be more of a dick chop.

279
00:12:24,656 --> 00:12:25,962
Looks chaotic, but it's not.

280
00:12:26,006 --> 00:12:27,529
If follows
a mathematical sequence.

281
00:12:27,572 --> 00:12:28,835
The leaves of this plant

282
00:12:28,878 --> 00:12:30,726
suggest that its origin
is exceptionally exotic.

283
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,031
Or it is just a made-up drawing.

284
00:12:32,055 --> 00:12:33,491
To an amateur,

285
00:12:33,535 --> 00:12:35,556
I could see that being
the easiest explanation, yes,

286
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,800
but no. No, this has something.

287
00:12:37,844 --> 00:12:39,822
Plants, they have a certain
integrity to them, hmm?

288
00:12:39,846 --> 00:12:40,847
It's hard to fake that.

289
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,674
Do you think
you can identify it?

290
00:12:42,718 --> 00:12:45,286
- Only guy who can.
- Mm, joy.

291
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:46,896
Would you be a sweetie

292
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,812
and get me a spectral-reactive
phytometer, a Bertric lens,

293
00:12:49,856 --> 00:12:50,987
and a pamplemousse LaCroix?

294
00:12:51,031 --> 00:12:52,249
Happy to.

295
00:12:52,293 --> 00:12:54,774
- No.
- If I stay, I might kill him.

296
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:08,875
The Dark King's immortal
because of a conduit?

297
00:13:08,918 --> 00:13:10,833
Like, a vitality conduit?

298
00:13:10,877 --> 00:13:12,966
Do we know what that is?

299
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,707
Guess not.

300
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:18,275
It's an old naturalist ritual.

301
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:21,844
Draw life force from a stalk
of corn to fight a summer cold,

302
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:22,976
that sort of thing.

303
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:24,629
Seb's immortality
comes from corn?

304
00:13:24,673 --> 00:13:26,370
What about a tree?

305
00:13:26,414 --> 00:13:27,807
He had a tattoo of one

306
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,418
with what looked like
maple leaves, only more jagged.

307
00:13:30,461 --> 00:13:31,593
Oh!

308
00:13:31,636 --> 00:13:33,769
You can just talk.

309
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,292
Uh, that's a Blackwood tree.

310
00:13:35,336 --> 00:13:36,772
Okay, so what if we locate

311
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,818
the tree from Seb's
tattoo and chop it down?

312
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:40,297
Would that sever this conduit?

313
00:13:40,341 --> 00:13:42,343
In theory, yes.

314
00:13:42,386 --> 00:13:45,781
He would be mortal
and 100% stab-able.

315
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,348
So how do we find this tree?

316
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:50,003
Who has two thumbs and aced
their elective in dousing?

317
00:13:51,918 --> 00:13:54,659
Probably safer
to send two of us, though.

318
00:13:54,703 --> 00:13:56,618
Just in case something
goes wrong.

319
00:13:56,661 --> 00:13:58,881
Well, I'm
a former tree goddess, I'll go.

320
00:13:58,925 --> 00:14:00,448
No!

321
00:14:00,491 --> 00:14:03,581
You can't go on a long hike
because you have the...

322
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:04,931
toe worms.

323
00:14:04,974 --> 00:14:07,934
Oh right, my toe worms.

324
00:14:07,977 --> 00:14:09,936
I thought that was just
a wooden toe thing.

325
00:14:09,979 --> 00:14:11,285
You thought wrong.

326
00:14:11,328 --> 00:14:13,896
There's a lot of misinformation
about toe worms.

327
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,551
I have them.
You gonna make me take a hike?

328
00:14:16,594 --> 00:14:19,467
No. No worm shame here.

329
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:23,514
Okay. How about you, Margo?

330
00:14:23,558 --> 00:14:24,838
Could use your Centurion skills

331
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,735
with all the Takers out there.

332
00:14:26,778 --> 00:14:27,973
If you do that,
it'll just leave me,

333
00:14:27,997 --> 00:14:29,869
and I kind of have a problem.

334
00:14:29,912 --> 00:14:32,654
After our last talk, Seb
told me to stay away from him,

335
00:14:32,697 --> 00:14:33,785
so I don't really think

336
00:14:33,829 --> 00:14:35,483
I'm in a position to, you know,

337
00:14:35,526 --> 00:14:36,919
stab him.

338
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:38,965
Yeah, but what if he needs you?

339
00:14:39,008 --> 00:14:40,618
You're his Magician advisor.

340
00:14:40,662 --> 00:14:41,944
Fen and I will come up
with a problem

341
00:14:41,968 --> 00:14:43,926
that takes two Magicians
to fix...

342
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,363
Assuming our toes can handle it.

343
00:14:48,017 --> 00:14:49,540
It'll be touch-and-go.

344
00:14:49,584 --> 00:14:52,674
Okay, but what if
the Dark King can feel it

345
00:14:52,717 --> 00:14:55,633
when we chop down the tree
and we have to act quickly?

346
00:14:55,677 --> 00:14:58,854
I just don't know how quick
I can be, given everything.

347
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:03,032
- Don't worry.
- We'll make it work.

348
00:15:03,076 --> 00:15:05,034
The fuck, Margo? You promised.

349
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:06,514
And I meant it.

350
00:15:06,557 --> 00:15:09,821
You won't be the one
to kill Seb, exactly.

351
00:15:09,865 --> 00:15:11,799
Why are you being so weird
and tricky about this?

352
00:15:11,823 --> 00:15:12,955
I thought I was clear.

353
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,088
Thank you.

354
00:15:15,131 --> 00:15:16,132
Wait.

355
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:22,158
That is the worst mojito I have
ever had in my entire life.

356
00:15:22,182 --> 00:15:24,140
That's because not a mojito.

357
00:15:24,184 --> 00:15:25,402
It's a potion.

358
00:15:25,446 --> 00:15:27,665
I was gonna explain
before you got all grabby,

359
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:29,580
but I guess here we go.

360
00:15:32,757 --> 00:15:33,933
Ugh.

361
00:15:34,585 --> 00:15:37,675
Seb needs to die.
You can't do it, but I can.

362
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:38,981
So get ready to...

363
00:15:39,025 --> 00:15:41,418
Ovary up, bitch.

364
00:15:47,468 --> 00:15:49,774
Margo, did we just
"Freaky Friday?"

365
00:16:00,655 --> 00:16:01,656
Bax!

366
00:16:05,747 --> 00:16:06,704
What did you do to him?

367
00:16:06,748 --> 00:16:09,055
He's fine, he's fine.

368
00:16:09,098 --> 00:16:11,013
Give me my page back.

369
00:16:11,057 --> 00:16:12,449
Look...

370
00:16:12,493 --> 00:16:13,929
I will buy it from you.

371
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:14,930
Name your price.

372
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,801
Put it down now.

373
00:16:26,942 --> 00:16:28,770
Holy shit.

374
00:16:28,813 --> 00:16:31,642
- I just pushed him.
- It shouldn't have done that.

375
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:38,954
What the hell was that?

376
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,000
We need to seal this room.

377
00:16:44,394 --> 00:16:47,006
- Jesus, Bambi.
- That was kind of nonconsensual.

378
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:48,572
You drank
before I could explain.

379
00:16:48,616 --> 00:16:51,097
I have been trying
to figure out to help you.

380
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,620
This is the only way
I could think of

381
00:16:52,663 --> 00:16:55,101
to keep your hands clean
of Seb's murder.

382
00:16:55,144 --> 00:16:56,424
Except they literally won't be.

383
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,712
Those are my hands.

384
00:16:57,755 --> 00:16:59,255
Look, you're the one
who can get close,

385
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,063
I'm the one
with the will to stab.

386
00:17:02,456 --> 00:17:06,590
El, I love you,
but we have to do this thing.

387
00:17:06,634 --> 00:17:08,462
Even you agree with that.

388
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:14,076
This is the best compromise
I could come up with.

389
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,773
So listen up... this spell's got

390
00:17:15,817 --> 00:17:18,298
a little quirk
you should probably know about.

391
00:17:18,341 --> 00:17:21,605
Tell anyone we've swapped and
we won't be able to swap back...

392
00:17:21,649 --> 00:17:23,129
Permanently.

393
00:17:23,172 --> 00:17:24,695
That is good to know.

394
00:17:28,351 --> 00:17:29,570
Strange.

395
00:17:29,613 --> 00:17:32,094
It's like you're Eliot
but not Eliot.

396
00:17:32,138 --> 00:17:34,270
Oh my God,
you're seeing Charlton.

397
00:17:34,314 --> 00:17:35,634
What kind of a name is Charlton?

398
00:17:35,663 --> 00:17:37,186
Family name. I never liked it.

399
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,753
He lives in my head...
Your head.

400
00:17:38,796 --> 00:17:40,798
And why is there a man living
in your head?

401
00:17:40,842 --> 00:17:44,106
Charlton and I
were Monster victims together.

402
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:47,501
He stayed in my head when
you pulled the Monster out.

403
00:17:47,544 --> 00:17:49,111
I held on real tight.

404
00:17:49,155 --> 00:17:52,636
So if he's in your head,
why didn't he swap with you?

405
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,160
I have no idea.

406
00:17:54,203 --> 00:17:55,770
Honestly, this is all very new.

407
00:17:55,813 --> 00:17:58,686
I'd have given you a heads-up
if I'd known your plan.

408
00:17:58,729 --> 00:17:59,730
Listen.

409
00:17:59,774 --> 00:18:02,385
Charlie,
stay the fuck out of my way.

410
00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:03,386
Hey, Bambi?

411
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,518
Before you go all...

412
00:18:04,561 --> 00:18:06,476
Bambi, and scare him off,

413
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,218
why don't you maybe
let him help you?

414
00:18:09,262 --> 00:18:10,524
I've managed just fine

415
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:12,743
without a Tyler Durden
up my cooch, thanks.

416
00:18:12,787 --> 00:18:13,875
I'm just saying

417
00:18:13,918 --> 00:18:16,312
this Seb situation
is pretty complicated.

418
00:18:16,356 --> 00:18:18,749
You're not exactly a...

419
00:18:18,793 --> 00:18:20,664
subtle relationship person.

420
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:22,579
From what I've seen, he's right.

421
00:18:22,623 --> 00:18:25,582
He's gotta ride a really
fine line with the Dark King.

422
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:29,847
He lost his love,
but he likes me,

423
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:31,545
so that feels like a betrayal.

424
00:18:31,588 --> 00:18:33,808
That is a lot of drama to track.

425
00:18:33,851 --> 00:18:35,853
What about you and Josh?

426
00:18:35,897 --> 00:18:37,420
Since I'll be going
on a long walk

427
00:18:37,464 --> 00:18:39,770
to cut down a tree with him,

428
00:18:39,814 --> 00:18:41,337
is there anything I should know?

429
00:18:41,381 --> 00:18:42,730
Yeah.

430
00:18:42,773 --> 00:18:45,124
If Josh tries to pull you
into any kind of talk,

431
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:47,169
just don't.

432
00:18:58,876 --> 00:19:00,791
I was a little surprised
to get your message

433
00:19:00,835 --> 00:19:03,446
after our last convo.

434
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:06,319
I know things got complicated.

435
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:08,582
The circumstances have changed.

436
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,889
Castle has been struck
with a strange sleeping curse.

437
00:19:11,933 --> 00:19:14,457
Is that what happened to...

438
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:15,545
Wow.

439
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:17,895
We've kept it quiet.

440
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:21,464
Obviously,
it requires a magical solution,

441
00:19:21,508 --> 00:19:23,423
but I'm afraid it's beyond me.

442
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,340
I think I know this curse.

443
00:19:27,383 --> 00:19:28,776
Good news, there's a cure.

444
00:19:28,819 --> 00:19:32,562
Only prob: It takes a bit
of cooperative spellwork.

445
00:19:32,606 --> 00:19:34,738
You need four hands to do it.

446
00:19:34,782 --> 00:19:36,610
- I see.
- So you wanna solve this,

447
00:19:36,653 --> 00:19:38,133
we're gonna have
to work together,

448
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,788
even if it makes uncomf
or whatevs.

449
00:19:40,831 --> 00:19:42,616
You sound strange.

450
00:19:44,444 --> 00:19:46,924
I haven't been feeling myself.

451
00:19:46,968 --> 00:19:48,622
Since our last talk.

452
00:19:48,665 --> 00:19:50,885
Yes.

453
00:19:50,928 --> 00:19:55,498
Let us work together
to solve this curious malady,

454
00:19:55,542 --> 00:19:58,414
for the good of Fillory.

455
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,547
That could've gone smoother.

456
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:16,693
Sleeping pollen
worked like a charm.

457
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:18,782
Or a curse, I guess.

458
00:20:18,826 --> 00:20:21,394
Oh, Umber's balls.

459
00:20:21,437 --> 00:20:24,614
Margo just keeps leaving
her uniform lying around.

460
00:20:24,658 --> 00:20:26,964
Makes me feel like a maid.

461
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:29,184
Right.

462
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,318
Julia, let me take over.
Rest is good for the baby.

463
00:20:32,361 --> 00:20:35,277
Not a baby. Still baking.

464
00:20:35,321 --> 00:20:37,323
But it'll become a baby.

465
00:20:37,366 --> 00:20:40,239
You do know
how this works, right?

466
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:41,457
Look, Fen,

467
00:20:41,501 --> 00:20:42,980
I just want to live my life

468
00:20:43,024 --> 00:20:46,462
without this defining
every aspect of it, you get me?

469
00:20:46,506 --> 00:20:47,700
Okay, well, if that's the truth

470
00:20:47,724 --> 00:20:49,726
then why haven't you
done something about it?

471
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:52,599
It's not a hard procedure,
not even in Fillory.

472
00:20:52,642 --> 00:20:53,991
You think I should abort it?

473
00:20:54,035 --> 00:20:57,734
I'm saying
you should make a choice.

474
00:20:57,778 --> 00:20:59,823
You're letting something
into your life

475
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:03,653
that you can't control and in
lots of ways will control you.

476
00:21:03,697 --> 00:21:06,439
It'll make you happy,

477
00:21:06,482 --> 00:21:08,267
or devastate you.

478
00:21:10,356 --> 00:21:11,400
Yeah.

479
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:15,491
Look, I've been pregnant before,

480
00:21:15,535 --> 00:21:17,711
and it was really bad.

481
00:21:17,754 --> 00:21:20,322
And I knew this time
if I told everyone about it,

482
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:22,629
they'd get worried
and overprotective

483
00:21:22,672 --> 00:21:25,675
and I just wanted to take one
of the next nine months

484
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:29,331
to feel like maybe this time

485
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:30,985
it wouldn't be so terrible,
you know?

486
00:21:31,028 --> 00:21:34,249
- Nine months?
- What are you talking about?

487
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,729
It's Red Monkey Month.

488
00:21:35,772 --> 00:21:36,947
Red Monkey what?

489
00:21:36,991 --> 00:21:39,515
Everything goes faster
in Red Monkey Month.

490
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:41,952
Healing, crop growth,

491
00:21:41,996 --> 00:21:43,563
weirdly, not monkeys.

492
00:21:43,606 --> 00:21:44,670
I'm sorry, are you saying that

493
00:21:44,694 --> 00:21:46,740
my pregnancy
is going to be sped up?

494
00:21:46,783 --> 00:21:48,481
Julia, it already is.

495
00:21:48,524 --> 00:21:49,917
As long as you stay in Fillory.

496
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,267
Oh, Jesus Christ.

497
00:22:00,536 --> 00:22:01,711
Get the fuck away from me.

498
00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:02,886
What's wrong?

499
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:05,672
I thought I saw a butterfly.

500
00:22:05,715 --> 00:22:08,501
You never know
where they're gonna go next.

501
00:22:08,544 --> 00:22:11,068
- Lavender rose macaron?
- I know they're your favorite.

502
00:22:11,112 --> 00:22:12,374
I'd better not.

503
00:22:12,418 --> 00:22:15,334
Margo, it's a snack, not a trap.

504
00:22:21,427 --> 00:22:22,950
You're a really good baker.

505
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:26,910
Also taller from this POV.

506
00:22:26,954 --> 00:22:28,390
I learned to dial in that recipe

507
00:22:28,434 --> 00:22:30,000
while I was stuck in the past.

508
00:22:30,044 --> 00:22:31,741
Fen had her knives,

509
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:32,916
I had baking.

510
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,091
Oh, yeah.

511
00:22:34,135 --> 00:22:35,547
That must've been tough
for you both.

512
00:22:35,571 --> 00:22:36,746
It was.

513
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,835
I mean... sorry,
I didn't mean to bring it up.

514
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:40,402
We don't have to talk about it.

515
00:22:40,446 --> 00:22:41,814
- Okay.
- How much further, you think?

516
00:22:41,838 --> 00:22:43,623
It's just
we thought we lost you guys,

517
00:22:43,666 --> 00:22:45,799
and it was a scary time, so...

518
00:22:45,842 --> 00:22:47,844
So we must be
getting near Seb's tree, huh?

519
00:22:47,888 --> 00:22:50,412
Are we really not gonna do this?

520
00:22:50,456 --> 00:22:52,980
Look, I'd be lying
if I said it didn't hurt

521
00:22:53,023 --> 00:22:54,764
when you wanted
to abandon me in the past,

522
00:22:54,808 --> 00:22:57,463
but I know it wasn't about me.

523
00:22:57,506 --> 00:22:59,421
Still, Margo, I have to ask.

524
00:22:59,465 --> 00:23:00,770
Do you wanna break up?

525
00:23:00,814 --> 00:23:03,686
I mean, are we even
a thing that can be broken up?

526
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,427
I...

527
00:23:05,471 --> 00:23:07,690
What do you think?

528
00:23:07,734 --> 00:23:10,432
Sometimes I feel like
that's what you want.

529
00:23:10,476 --> 00:23:12,652
Look, when we got together,
I said I wasn't into games,

530
00:23:12,695 --> 00:23:14,610
and do you remember
what you said?

531
00:23:14,654 --> 00:23:16,046
Oh.

532
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:17,961
You said, "Fuck games."

533
00:23:18,005 --> 00:23:19,659
That does sound like me.

534
00:23:19,702 --> 00:23:21,965
I can accept it's over
if you just say the words.

535
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:22,966
Josh, I wanna talk.

536
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:25,578
I really do, but I can't.

537
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,712
Except to say

538
00:23:29,756 --> 00:23:31,497
that maybe I need
a little more time

539
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,716
to forgive myself.

540
00:23:34,848 --> 00:23:38,155
Oh. Uh, really?

541
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:39,505
Yes!

542
00:23:39,548 --> 00:23:41,028
Because I've realized

543
00:23:41,071 --> 00:23:43,049
that deciding to leave you
in the past was a mistake...

544
00:23:43,073 --> 00:23:44,510
A big one.

545
00:23:44,553 --> 00:23:47,164
And now I need
to earn your forgiveness,

546
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:48,644
which may take a while,

547
00:23:48,688 --> 00:23:51,821
so we can kind of
keep things status quo

548
00:23:51,865 --> 00:23:52,996
in the meantime.

549
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,563
I...

550
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:56,478
Sure, sure.

551
00:23:56,522 --> 00:23:57,523
Great.

552
00:23:57,566 --> 00:23:58,915
Now, which way to the tree?

553
00:23:58,959 --> 00:23:59,960
Uh...

554
00:24:07,881 --> 00:24:10,449
I think Ray
was hosting a symbiote.

555
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:12,668
- He was possessed?
- Not possessed.

556
00:24:12,712 --> 00:24:15,018
It's rare, but a few
fungus species have been known

557
00:24:15,062 --> 00:24:17,020
to join consciousness
with other creatures.

558
00:24:17,064 --> 00:24:20,110
You're still you, you just
share brainpower, thoughts.

559
00:24:20,154 --> 00:24:21,851
And then you explode.

560
00:24:21,895 --> 00:24:23,157
Well, I'm not a mushroom guy,

561
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,593
but I think that's because.

562
00:24:24,637 --> 00:24:27,509
Ray merged with the fungus
a long, long time ago.

563
00:24:27,553 --> 00:24:29,859
Is he... shit, are they dead?

564
00:24:29,903 --> 00:24:31,426
Ray is,

565
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,081
but those particles that came
out of him were fungal spores.

566
00:24:34,124 --> 00:24:36,170
They'll want a new host body.

567
00:24:36,213 --> 00:24:37,693
I sealed them inside the lab,

568
00:24:37,737 --> 00:24:39,869
but it might be a good idea
to close the air vents.

569
00:24:39,913 --> 00:24:41,958
Yeah, hi. New to this job.

570
00:24:42,002 --> 00:24:44,787
I have no idea how
to control the school vents.

571
00:24:44,831 --> 00:24:45,962
We need to evacuate.

572
00:24:46,006 --> 00:24:47,921
Knew I should've trusted
my instincts.

573
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:55,537
Hey, hey! There's a, um...

574
00:24:55,581 --> 00:24:56,712
Eukaryotic photosymbiont.

575
00:24:56,756 --> 00:24:58,540
Yeah, there's a monster
on the loose.

576
00:24:58,584 --> 00:25:02,109
Head to the Physical Kids'
Cottage to be quarantined now.

577
00:25:06,592 --> 00:25:08,463
Alice, give us the plant page...

578
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,552
Then we'll stop spreading.

579
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:15,601
Oh, oh. Okay!

580
00:25:17,298 --> 00:25:19,648
New theory: The fungus can
spread to multiple hosts.

581
00:25:19,692 --> 00:25:21,104
This might be a zombie plague
situation.

582
00:25:21,128 --> 00:25:22,564
- What?
- What?

583
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,574
I say this is the man
who blew up my Brakebills.

584
00:25:32,618 --> 00:25:34,620
You're the worst goddamn dean
we've ever had.

585
00:25:34,663 --> 00:25:38,319
Yeah, I'm not here
for a lecture from my prisoner.

586
00:25:38,362 --> 00:25:39,712
Just hiding from spores.

587
00:25:39,755 --> 00:25:41,322
Oh, so you remember

588
00:25:41,365 --> 00:25:43,193
that this room
is hermetically sealed,

589
00:25:43,237 --> 00:25:45,413
but not to consult
the "Do Not Admit" list?

590
00:25:45,456 --> 00:25:47,502
I did everything a dean
is supposed to do.

591
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:50,505
A dean is supposed
to have strong instincts,

592
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,594
like knowing anyone
who'd visit Anansia

593
00:25:52,638 --> 00:25:55,423
is also insane enough
to visit other worlds

594
00:25:55,466 --> 00:25:58,121
with infections
for which we cannot test.

595
00:25:58,165 --> 00:26:00,254
- DO you want to help or what?
- Yes.

596
00:26:00,297 --> 00:26:02,604
I can provide a solution...

597
00:26:02,648 --> 00:26:04,345
In exchange for my release.

598
00:26:04,388 --> 00:26:06,042
How do we know
you really have one?

599
00:26:06,086 --> 00:26:09,393
I developed a potion
with a Dr. Maria Pilkin.

600
00:26:09,437 --> 00:26:12,222
You can check with her.

601
00:26:12,266 --> 00:26:13,702
But...

602
00:26:13,746 --> 00:26:17,314
She died in this timeline.

603
00:26:17,358 --> 00:26:19,403
No deal.

604
00:26:19,447 --> 00:26:21,057
We'll find our own way.

605
00:26:21,101 --> 00:26:23,364
You cannot save your students
without my help.

606
00:26:24,713 --> 00:26:25,975
See, in our timeline.

607
00:26:26,019 --> 00:26:28,456
Pilkin's work was published
after her death,

608
00:26:28,499 --> 00:26:30,458
so it's in our library.

609
00:26:32,068 --> 00:26:35,071
Gave away your leverage.

610
00:26:35,115 --> 00:26:37,465
Thought a dean was supposed
to have strong instincts.

611
00:26:37,508 --> 00:26:40,120
I will get out of here,

612
00:26:40,163 --> 00:26:44,211
and then I'll turn you
into lobsters

613
00:26:44,254 --> 00:26:45,647
and eat you.

614
00:26:45,691 --> 00:26:47,170
Uh, okay.

615
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:01,489
Okay, the book we need
is right there.

616
00:27:01,532 --> 00:27:02,621
See any twitching?

617
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:04,057
Just assume
they're all infected.

618
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,059
And assume
they're all looking for us.

619
00:27:06,102 --> 00:27:07,602
It's too risky for us
to go in together.

620
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,671
I know where it is. I'll go.

621
00:27:09,715 --> 00:27:11,064
Hey.

622
00:27:11,107 --> 00:27:13,153
Remember, magic is
unpredictable outside the lab.

623
00:27:13,196 --> 00:27:15,416
So no phosphoromancy.

624
00:27:15,459 --> 00:27:16,480
Good thing I have experience

625
00:27:16,504 --> 00:27:18,811
being invisible
from high school.

626
00:28:24,615 --> 00:28:26,269
Ooh, ooh.

627
00:28:28,794 --> 00:28:30,404
You got us the book
and a guinea pig.

628
00:28:30,447 --> 00:28:31,884
Nice work.

629
00:28:31,927 --> 00:28:34,582
It said the potion
should work fast.

630
00:28:46,202 --> 00:28:47,726
Penny.

631
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:49,162
Oh, shit.

632
00:28:49,205 --> 00:28:50,467
Penny.

633
00:28:52,818 --> 00:28:54,341
Just give up the page, Alice.

634
00:29:06,396 --> 00:29:07,528
Almost ready.

635
00:29:07,571 --> 00:29:08,703
Great.

636
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,226
Uh...

637
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:12,402
Margo, you have
to draw this out.

638
00:29:12,446 --> 00:29:13,858
The second they wake,
Seb will dismiss you.

639
00:29:13,882 --> 00:29:15,449
No shit, Sherlock.

640
00:29:15,492 --> 00:29:17,320
This is all part of my plan
to win him over.

641
00:29:17,364 --> 00:29:18,757
How is finishing the ritual

642
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,628
early and in silence
part of your plan?

643
00:29:20,671 --> 00:29:22,848
Because I taught it
to him wrong,

644
00:29:22,891 --> 00:29:25,633
so to fix it, I'm gonna have
to get real close and personal.

645
00:29:25,676 --> 00:29:27,461
Eliot?

646
00:29:27,504 --> 00:29:29,395
Something in the middle section
doesn't feeling right.

647
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:30,832
The energies aren't moving
as they should.

648
00:29:30,856 --> 00:29:32,466
Hmm.

649
00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:33,902
I can walk you through it.

650
00:29:40,691 --> 00:29:42,781
Wait.

651
00:29:42,824 --> 00:29:44,608
That's not right.

652
00:29:47,698 --> 00:29:48,743
Here.

653
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:56,490
We should keep our distance.

654
00:29:56,533 --> 00:29:58,753
It will make things easier.

655
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,320
Right.

656
00:30:00,363 --> 00:30:01,582
Of course.

657
00:30:03,976 --> 00:30:05,586
If you need my help, just ask.

658
00:30:05,629 --> 00:30:06,848
Jesus' clits.

659
00:30:06,892 --> 00:30:08,676
I know how to work a guy,
Charlton.

660
00:30:08,719 --> 00:30:10,809
Yes. You do, Margo.

661
00:30:10,852 --> 00:30:12,636
As Eliot, you're coming on
too strong.

662
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,682
Seb likes Eliot's vulnerability.

663
00:30:14,725 --> 00:30:17,685
Don't be pushy, just open up.

664
00:30:17,728 --> 00:30:21,297
He and Eliot are close because
of the losses they share.

665
00:30:25,562 --> 00:30:27,869
I can show you the rest
if you're ready.

666
00:30:27,913 --> 00:30:30,916
But first,
I think I owe you an apology.

667
00:30:30,959 --> 00:30:33,657
- Eliot, that's not necessary.
- It's just...

668
00:30:33,701 --> 00:30:36,878
I haven't felt this way
in a really long time.

669
00:30:36,922 --> 00:30:40,403
I think the fact that we both...

670
00:30:40,447 --> 00:30:42,884
It just felt safe with you,
you know?

671
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:48,237
On that mountain
we both felt it.

672
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:50,892
There's nothing wrong
with wanting more.

673
00:30:50,936 --> 00:30:54,722
I wish I could give you more,
but I just can't.

674
00:30:54,765 --> 00:30:58,595
I must put Fillory first,
even if it means I suffer.

675
00:31:00,423 --> 00:31:02,425
I do hope you understand that.

676
00:31:03,557 --> 00:31:04,819
I get it.

677
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,995
It's hard to be king.

678
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,997
People don't know
what you go through.

679
00:31:13,567 --> 00:31:15,917
Now let me show you how
to do that spell correctly.

680
00:31:31,802 --> 00:31:33,413
Are we close to the tree?

681
00:31:33,456 --> 00:31:35,371
I don't mean to rush.
You're the expert.

682
00:31:35,415 --> 00:31:37,330
Okay, that's it.

683
00:31:37,373 --> 00:31:38,418
I'm not buying it.

684
00:31:38,461 --> 00:31:40,942
- Not buying what?
- Any of this.

685
00:31:40,986 --> 00:31:43,597
Emotional, agreeable, patient?

686
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,598
You're not Margo.

687
00:31:44,641 --> 00:31:45,860
Who else would I be?

688
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,949
This is Fillory. I don't know.

689
00:31:47,993 --> 00:31:51,953
You could be a hallucination,
or... or a shapeshifter,

690
00:31:51,997 --> 00:31:53,912
or an agent of the Dark King.

691
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:56,915
But I'm not. Josh, I'm...

692
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:58,742
Shit.

693
00:31:58,786 --> 00:32:00,266
I wish I could explain.

694
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:03,922
Oh, well, until you do,
I'm not taking you to the tree.

695
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,837
Got it?

696
00:32:15,237 --> 00:32:16,847
The antifungal kind of worked.

697
00:32:16,891 --> 00:32:17,955
We got the spores out of him.

698
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:19,546
Yeah, and into Penny.

699
00:32:19,589 --> 00:32:21,852
It must be the fungus'
networking ability.

700
00:32:21,896 --> 00:32:23,245
Long as it's alive
in other hosts,

701
00:32:23,289 --> 00:32:25,267
it can still direct its spores
into whoever it wants.

702
00:32:25,291 --> 00:32:27,554
- So why not into us?
- We were right there.

703
00:32:27,597 --> 00:32:29,425
Penny was closer?

704
00:32:29,469 --> 00:32:30,905
I thought you were an expert.

705
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,472
I told you this isn't my area.

706
00:32:32,515 --> 00:32:35,910
At this point, my best advice?
Give the fungus what it wants.

707
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,520
No.

708
00:32:37,564 --> 00:32:40,436
Ever since I found this page
I knew it was important.

709
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,048
If the fungus wants it,
I was right.

710
00:32:43,091 --> 00:32:44,484
I have to know what it means.

711
00:32:44,527 --> 00:32:46,225
Is it worth dying over?

712
00:32:46,268 --> 00:32:47,376
Is that what Quentin would want?

713
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,141
For you to die, too?

714
00:32:49,184 --> 00:32:51,012
Back the fuck off, botanist.

715
00:32:52,057 --> 00:32:54,973
Sorry. Maybe I overstepped.

716
00:32:55,016 --> 00:32:56,365
It's just...

717
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,109
Remember that plant I put
on the windowsill in the lab?

718
00:33:01,153 --> 00:33:02,981
Yeah, you only screamed
at me about it.

719
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:04,634
Scottish primrose.

720
00:33:04,678 --> 00:33:06,114
It's this fragile little flower.

721
00:33:06,158 --> 00:33:07,681
Even grass can kill it,

722
00:33:07,724 --> 00:33:11,946
so it has to survive on cliff
walls where nothing else can.

723
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,862
It was my wife Isobel's
favorite.

724
00:33:17,473 --> 00:33:20,650
- Primula scotica isobelae.
- You named it after her?

725
00:33:20,694 --> 00:33:23,479
You remembered the name.

726
00:33:23,523 --> 00:33:27,048
She loved that stupid flower.

727
00:33:27,092 --> 00:33:28,919
Kept it alive
without any spellwork.

728
00:33:28,963 --> 00:33:31,139
Huge point of pride.

729
00:33:31,183 --> 00:33:34,403
But I thought it was just
kind of silly.

730
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:40,453
Then she died,
so now I keep it alive.

731
00:33:40,496 --> 00:33:42,542
If it's anything like that,

732
00:33:42,585 --> 00:33:45,371
I get why you'd
wanna keep that page.

733
00:33:48,548 --> 00:33:50,593
How long ago?

734
00:33:50,637 --> 00:33:53,509
Five years. You?

735
00:33:53,553 --> 00:33:56,034
A lot less.

736
00:33:56,077 --> 00:33:59,689
So how long until, you know,
it feels

737
00:33:59,733 --> 00:34:02,040
less like it's eating
all of you?

738
00:34:02,083 --> 00:34:04,564
I'm kind of still waiting.

739
00:34:04,607 --> 00:34:07,219
I just feel like I'm gonna be

740
00:34:07,262 --> 00:34:09,656
this walking whatever-I-am
forever.

741
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:12,093
I did too.

742
00:34:12,137 --> 00:34:15,183
It starts like
this tight ball in your chest,

743
00:34:15,227 --> 00:34:17,620
but over time, it gets lighter

744
00:34:17,664 --> 00:34:22,408
because it just kind of spreads
into the rest of you.

745
00:34:22,451 --> 00:34:24,410
It's like your own personal
symbiote.

746
00:34:24,453 --> 00:34:27,369
Yeah, kind of.

747
00:34:27,413 --> 00:34:31,504
Except not murderous
and weirdly paper-focused.

748
00:34:31,547 --> 00:34:34,072
Just, uh...

749
00:34:34,115 --> 00:34:36,074
sad.

750
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:37,117
Yeah.

751
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,557
Make it to a year.

752
00:34:41,601 --> 00:34:45,996
It'll still suck,
but it gets quieter.

753
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,129
I promise.

754
00:34:56,006 --> 00:34:58,096
Shit.

755
00:34:58,139 --> 00:34:59,619
I know what to do.

756
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:06,539
Damn.

757
00:35:06,582 --> 00:35:10,108
I actually felt bad for him,
for what he's been through.

758
00:35:10,151 --> 00:35:12,762
He's a nice man,
but an evil king.

759
00:35:12,806 --> 00:35:14,547
It doesn't make sense.

760
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:16,679
He seems kind.

761
00:35:16,723 --> 00:35:20,118
He seems sad.

762
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:23,773
Why the fuck would he summon
those monsters into Fillory?

763
00:35:23,817 --> 00:35:25,601
Eliot.

764
00:35:25,645 --> 00:35:29,736
I think we're finished.
It worked.

765
00:35:29,779 --> 00:35:32,478
Before you go,
perhaps we should talk?

766
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:37,396
I don't know
why he summoned them,

767
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:39,679
but I don't think we're gonna
get another chance at this.

768
00:35:51,236 --> 00:35:53,281
Not as easy as it looks, is it?

769
00:35:53,325 --> 00:35:55,544
Josh, please.

770
00:35:55,588 --> 00:35:57,024
Eliot's waiting for the signal.

771
00:35:57,067 --> 00:35:58,436
If we don't chop down the tree,
he's screwed.

772
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,592
We're screwed!

773
00:35:59,635 --> 00:36:01,202
You said
you wish you could explain.

774
00:36:01,246 --> 00:36:04,249
That means there's something
to explain, so explain.

775
00:36:04,292 --> 00:36:06,140
So you've been wanting
to talk to me for weeks

776
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:09,428
about what happened between us,
but when I finally apologize

777
00:36:09,471 --> 00:36:11,647
you accuse me
of being possessed.

778
00:36:11,691 --> 00:36:13,040
Right, apologize.

779
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:14,322
Does that sound like Margo
to you?

780
00:36:14,346 --> 00:36:15,738
Fine!

781
00:36:15,782 --> 00:36:17,479
Maybe I was saying
what you wanted to hear,

782
00:36:17,523 --> 00:36:19,612
'cause you never let up.

783
00:36:19,655 --> 00:36:21,111
You keep trying to get me
to talk about something

784
00:36:21,135 --> 00:36:23,181
I don't wanna talk about.

785
00:36:23,224 --> 00:36:25,748
Okay. Fine, I get that.

786
00:36:25,792 --> 00:36:27,054
You wanna know the truth?

787
00:36:27,097 --> 00:36:28,814
You picked someone
who will never put your first.

788
00:36:28,838 --> 00:36:31,406
There's no fixing Margo...
I mean me,

789
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:33,452
'cause chances are
if I had to relive it,

790
00:36:33,495 --> 00:36:35,193
I'd make the same decision.

791
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:37,586
So stop asking me
to apologize for something

792
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,762
I don't feel sorry about.

793
00:36:42,591 --> 00:36:45,072
Now you sound like you.

794
00:36:45,115 --> 00:36:47,379
Not that I won't
feel differently tomorrow.

795
00:36:47,422 --> 00:36:51,513
- No, you won't.
- You're very clear.

796
00:36:51,557 --> 00:36:53,559
The Conduit Tree's
that one over there.

797
00:36:53,602 --> 00:36:54,603
Cut it down.

798
00:36:54,647 --> 00:36:56,388
I'll give Eliot the green light.

799
00:36:57,302 --> 00:36:58,607
Oh, God.

800
00:37:00,522 --> 00:37:01,610
I'm fine here.

801
00:37:01,654 --> 00:37:03,438
Go help the others
search the castle

802
00:37:03,482 --> 00:37:06,180
for any remaining victims
of the sleeping curse.

803
00:37:12,752 --> 00:37:15,363
What you said last night...

804
00:37:15,407 --> 00:37:16,886
Did you mean it?

805
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:19,149
Um...

806
00:37:19,193 --> 00:37:20,760
Oh, right.

807
00:37:20,803 --> 00:37:23,328
Uh, Eliot asked Seb if he'd
consider giving up the throne.

808
00:37:23,371 --> 00:37:25,460
He even offered to help him,
but Seb said no.

809
00:37:25,504 --> 00:37:27,680
Eliot, are you all right?

810
00:37:27,723 --> 00:37:30,335
Yes, sorry.

811
00:37:30,378 --> 00:37:31,771
Of course I meant it.

812
00:37:31,814 --> 00:37:35,253
Because I've been thinking.

813
00:37:35,296 --> 00:37:36,752
- Margo, the candles.
- That's the signal.

814
00:37:36,776 --> 00:37:38,734
They cut down Seb's tree.

815
00:37:38,778 --> 00:37:41,171
- Eliot?
- It's now or never.

816
00:37:47,308 --> 00:37:49,179
Eliot should be done by now.

817
00:37:53,749 --> 00:37:56,665
- Well, they're in a hurry.
- Gods, we're in trouble.

818
00:37:56,709 --> 00:37:57,840
Here, take my extra knife.

819
00:37:57,884 --> 00:37:58,841
All the knives in the world

820
00:37:58,885 --> 00:38:00,452
won't get us past
the Centurions.

821
00:38:00,495 --> 00:38:02,715
Do you have a better plan?

822
00:38:02,758 --> 00:38:05,326
- Are you under a hex?
- A witch's spell?

823
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:06,588
What's going on?

824
00:38:06,632 --> 00:38:08,460
I can explain.

825
00:38:08,503 --> 00:38:11,680
Just... there will be
serious consequences if I do.

826
00:38:11,724 --> 00:38:12,768
No, you can't tell him.

827
00:38:12,812 --> 00:38:13,963
Margo, you'll be stuck in there.

828
00:38:13,987 --> 00:38:15,181
There will be
serious consequences

829
00:38:15,205 --> 00:38:16,511
if you don't explain.

830
00:38:46,846 --> 00:38:48,717
You asked and I'm here.

831
00:38:50,153 --> 00:38:51,677
So...

832
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,288
You gonna give up the page
or make us spore you, too?

833
00:38:57,944 --> 00:38:59,859
I'll give it to you.

834
00:39:01,426 --> 00:39:03,776
If you tell me why you want it.

835
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,301
- It's an instruction manual.
- For what?

836
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,347
The World Seed.

837
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,131
It's magical botanical organism.

838
00:39:11,174 --> 00:39:13,829
Legend is, the seed
is pure potential.

839
00:39:13,873 --> 00:39:17,703
The right nurturing, it can
grow into almost everything...

840
00:39:17,746 --> 00:39:20,140
Even an entire world.

841
00:39:20,183 --> 00:39:21,291
Well, if you want the page,

842
00:39:21,315 --> 00:39:23,143
does that mean
you already have the seed?

843
00:39:23,186 --> 00:39:25,145
We're done talking.

844
00:39:36,025 --> 00:39:38,114
Alice?

845
00:39:38,158 --> 00:39:39,768
What are you doing to us?

846
00:39:39,812 --> 00:39:41,422
Me?

847
00:39:41,466 --> 00:39:43,859
I'm just keeping you talking.

848
00:39:43,903 --> 00:39:45,121
All that shared brainpower

849
00:39:45,165 --> 00:39:47,210
and you never thought
to yourselves,

850
00:39:47,254 --> 00:39:48,951
where's Bax?

851
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,800
I mean, you had us stumped
for a while.

852
00:39:51,824 --> 00:39:54,261
It seemed like
if we got you out of one host

853
00:39:54,304 --> 00:39:56,108
you'd just keep spreading
yourself to other ones,

854
00:39:56,132 --> 00:39:57,438
but you didn't.

855
00:39:57,482 --> 00:40:00,485
For some reason,
you were limiting yourself.

856
00:40:00,528 --> 00:40:03,270
Some of your spores
didn't try to spread.

857
00:40:03,313 --> 00:40:04,750
Bax wasn't sure why

858
00:40:04,793 --> 00:40:08,884
because fungi
can typically grow and grow.

859
00:40:08,928 --> 00:40:12,235
But you're also
a consciousness, like us.

860
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,718
And we have limits.

861
00:40:16,762 --> 00:40:19,460
Try to juggle too much at once
and we're useless.

862
00:40:19,504 --> 00:40:22,071
- It's a professor thing.
- Just go with it.

863
00:40:22,115 --> 00:40:26,859
So I have Bax spreading you
too thin to affect your hosts

864
00:40:26,902 --> 00:40:28,904
mentally or physically.

865
00:40:30,166 --> 00:40:32,908
You won't be able
to control them anymore.

866
00:40:32,952 --> 00:40:34,040
You're killing me.

867
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:35,389
No.

868
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:39,088
Don't worry, you'll be
a part of your host forever.

869
00:40:39,132 --> 00:40:41,351
You're just getting quieter.

870
00:40:57,106 --> 00:40:59,500
This is
the worst fucking job ever.

871
00:40:59,544 --> 00:41:03,243
Penny, are you okay?

872
00:41:03,286 --> 00:41:05,288
Got your page.

873
00:41:05,332 --> 00:41:07,508
Did you know why you wanted it?

874
00:41:07,552 --> 00:41:10,859
It's fading, but...

875
00:41:10,903 --> 00:41:13,253
to sell.

876
00:41:13,296 --> 00:41:16,430
There was this huge debt to pay.

877
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,911
I don't know what for, but...

878
00:41:18,954 --> 00:41:21,000
when The Couple came
to collect, we didn't...

879
00:41:21,043 --> 00:41:23,916
They didn't ask any questions.

880
00:41:23,959 --> 00:41:25,004
A couple of?

881
00:41:25,047 --> 00:41:28,094
No. The Couple.

882
00:41:28,137 --> 00:41:31,924
Weird name, but I remember
feeling scared shitless.

883
00:41:31,967 --> 00:41:37,103
The Couple has power.
It has resources.

884
00:41:37,146 --> 00:41:39,845
It's been looking for the
World Seed page a long time,

885
00:41:39,888 --> 00:41:42,108
and they are not good people.

886
00:41:42,151 --> 00:41:44,371
And they know
I have what they want.

887
00:41:44,414 --> 00:41:45,566
I don't think that's gonna be

888
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:48,070
the last person or thing
to come after it.

889
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:51,900
The hell was Coldwater doing

890
00:41:51,944 --> 00:41:54,381
with instructions
to something so powerful?

891
00:41:54,424 --> 00:41:56,252
Yeah.

892
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:00,256
I have no idea.

893
00:42:01,649 --> 00:42:03,564
Jesus Christ, El.
You had one job:

894
00:42:03,608 --> 00:42:05,479
Don't blow up
my relationship with Josh.

895
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06,524
And what did you do?

896
00:42:06,567 --> 00:42:07,699
I'm sorry.

897
00:42:07,742 --> 00:42:09,614
There's no way
to avoid that conversation.

898
00:42:09,657 --> 00:42:12,921
He's just so goddamn persistent.

899
00:42:12,965 --> 00:42:14,140
Tell me about it.

900
00:42:14,183 --> 00:42:15,533
By the by,

901
00:42:15,576 --> 00:42:17,336
Charlton's gonna go hang out
in your beach memories

902
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,536
for a while.

903
00:42:18,579 --> 00:42:20,320
Think the whole Seb thing
was hard on him.

904
00:42:20,363 --> 00:42:23,105
So um, what did
you and Seb talk about?

905
00:42:23,149 --> 00:42:26,021
You know, before?

906
00:42:26,065 --> 00:42:27,414
Don't do this to yourself.

907
00:42:27,457 --> 00:42:29,111
I ended your relationship.

908
00:42:29,155 --> 00:42:32,114
Seems like I deserve whatever
pain's coming my way.

909
00:42:32,158 --> 00:42:34,334
That wasn't your fault.

910
00:42:34,377 --> 00:42:36,162
You were just dealing
with some shit I set up

911
00:42:36,205 --> 00:42:37,511
way before you took over.

912
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,208
So in summation,

913
00:42:39,252 --> 00:42:42,168
we're both equally skilled at
destroying our own happiness?

914
00:42:42,211 --> 00:42:43,996
Yeah.

915
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:47,869
Well, at least we used
our powers for good?

916
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:51,675
How fucked up is it
that I miss him?

917
00:42:51,699 --> 00:42:56,008
El, there's
nothing wrong with you.

918
00:42:56,051 --> 00:42:57,270
He was hot and complicated.

919
00:42:57,313 --> 00:42:59,185
Those are the ones
worth banging.

920
00:42:59,228 --> 00:43:01,535
You've just had some shitty luck

921
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,189
with boys so far, that's all.

922
00:43:03,232 --> 00:43:05,147
It doesn't mean
you don't deserve love

923
00:43:05,191 --> 00:43:08,411
or that you won't ever find it.

924
00:43:08,455 --> 00:43:11,937
Well, at least I have
better luck with friends.
