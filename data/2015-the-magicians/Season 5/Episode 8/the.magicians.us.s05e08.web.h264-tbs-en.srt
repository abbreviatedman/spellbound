1
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:08,761
‐ Previously
on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:09,243 --> 00:00:10,320
‐ I see blood on the walls.

3
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:11,278
I hear its voice.

4
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:13,080
It wants out.

5
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:14,224
‐ Have you tried
letting it out?

6
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:15,249
‐ Charlton?

7
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:17,951
‐ I once was possessed
by the Monster too.

8
00:00:17,985 --> 00:00:19,820
When all the scary creatures
were pulled out,

9
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,855
I held on tight as I could
in your happy place.

10
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:24,958
‐ I found this
in Q's stuff at Brakebills.

11
00:00:24,992 --> 00:00:26,126
‐ Professor?

12
00:00:26,159 --> 00:00:28,295
I mean‐‐
Dean Adiyodi?

13
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:29,796
‐ Yeah, come in.

14
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,498
‐ What did you do
with Fogg 17?

15
00:00:31,532 --> 00:00:33,567
‐ I call that one Psycho Fogg.

16
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,736
‐ Put him in the clean room.
He can't cast there, so.

17
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:36,737
‐ I can't do what I need to do

18
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:39,072
if I'm worried about
how it's gonna affect you.

19
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:40,607
I think we need to be done.

20
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:42,018
‐ I'm interviewing
for the botany job.

21
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,510
Hamish Bax.

22
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,846
‐ If I'm right, this should
adjust circumstances

23
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,281
in the entire greenhouse,

24
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:48,916
allowing us to cast.

25
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:51,552
‐ You risked everything
for us.

26
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:53,487
The least we can do
is to show you the truth.

27
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,757
‐

28
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:08,302
‐

29
00:01:08,335 --> 00:01:12,005
You can't outrun me!

30
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,193
‐ Six children taken.
It's horrific.

31
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:35,095
‐ The Takers are swarming.
‐ It's my fault.

32
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,799
They're swarming because Seb
summoned them with a spell

33
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:40,634
using the gold I gave him.

34
00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,502
I didn't know
what he was gonna do with it.

35
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:45,739
‐ The Takers‐‐
that's how he stays in power.

36
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,874
He summons them
and only he can fight them.

37
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:48,942
‐ Jesus.

38
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:50,853
I go away to my nephew's
bar mitzvah for one weekend

39
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:52,312
and everything gets fercockt.

40
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:53,080
What are we going to do?

41
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,416
‐ We gotta kill the Dark King.

42
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,218
What?
We're all thinking it.

43
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:01,288
‐ Eli's Torah portion was
all about the sanctity of life,

44
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:03,156
and I found it very moving.

45
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,994
So, can't we, I don't know,
peacefully overthrow him?

46
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:08,662
‐ No, we can't.

47
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:12,232
He's got a Centurion army.
I should know. I'm one of 'em.

48
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,034
‐ Also 300 years of propaganda

49
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,311
convincing everyone
they need him.

50
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,337
‐ Also‐also, 300 years?

51
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:20,641
We're talking a powerful,
immortal magician?

52
00:02:20,674 --> 00:02:22,909
Doubt you can just walk up
and stab the guy.

53
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:24,711
‐ I've been researching.

54
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:26,656
The Dark King survived
seven assassination attempts

55
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,690
since he took our thrones.

56
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,950
‐ Must be big magic
keeping him alive.

57
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,085
We have to figure out
what it is.

58
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:32,886
Find out his weakness.

59
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,030
‐ You're on board
with this too?

60
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:36,757
‐ I mean, I'm here to stop
an apocalypse that happens

61
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:39,693
'cause an evil force invades
from a distant realm.

62
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,061
That sounds like the Takers.

63
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:42,396
‐ Then it's settled.

64
00:02:42,429 --> 00:02:43,463
We kill the Dark King,

65
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:45,599
stop the Takers from pouring
in, stop the apocalypse.

66
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,400
Who's in?

67
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:48,869
‐ Just a couple of Q's, like

68
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,680
how are we gonna get
close enough to the Dark King

69
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:52,372
to learn his weakness
and assassinate him?

70
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:54,775
We're a cook, a maid,
a army grunt,

71
00:02:54,808 --> 00:02:57,244
a Julia, and a‐‐

72
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:59,246
‐ Counselor/confidante.

73
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,281
You gotta admit, El,
you're perfectly placed.

74
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:02,282
Plus, he's always dismissing

75
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:05,686
his guards
when you come around.

76
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:08,288
‐ Why does me liking somebody
always end up with them dying?

77
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,190
‐ You should
tell your friends, Eliot.

78
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,159
‐ That I don't want
to save Fillory

79
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,860
because I caught feelings?

80
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:14,937
‐ I'm saying
they should know how you feel

81
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:17,397
before they try to make you
do something you regret.

82
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:20,067
‐ No, I'll just look selfish,
Charlton.

83
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,035
And I'll still end up having
to do it.

84
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:25,038
‐ Talking to somebody?
‐ Um...

85
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:27,908
myself and psyching myself up.

86
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:29,118
Fillory needs
the Dark King dead

87
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:31,278
and I am
the obvious inside man.

88
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,013
‐ You sound weird.
‐ You sound weird.

89
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:33,980
‐ Okay.

90
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:35,549
It's that Eliot.

91
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:38,452
‐ Uh, look,
I know I'm just the guy

92
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,129
who has to live inside your
tragic remembrances and all

93
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,488
but I truly don't understand

94
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:43,523
why you won't
at least tell her.

95
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:44,791
‐ Margo.

96
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:46,693
Look‐‐

97
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,395
I'm not sure I can
go through with this.

98
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,764
‐ El, you have a crush
on a boy who's bad for you.

99
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:51,698
Happens to all of us,

100
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:54,334
but how do we get crushes
out of our system?

101
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,436
‐ Lots of drinking, pining,

102
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,804
some detailed sex fantasies.

103
00:03:57,838 --> 00:03:58,705
‐ No.

104
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,273
We bang them out.

105
00:04:00,307 --> 00:04:02,109
‐ Okay, that's great,

106
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:03,720
except for the part where now
I have to murder the guy

107
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,612
I just hypothetically
slept with,

108
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:07,090
which is a thing
that shouldn't really happen

109
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:08,381
to a person more than once.

110
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,549
‐ El,

111
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,985
Fillory does need this,

112
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:14,154
so if you can't do it,
tell me now.

113
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:19,025
‐ I know he has to die,
but I don't hate him.

114
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:21,328
I don't.
I can't.

115
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,196
‐ I can't make
betraying Seb easier,

116
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:25,065
but let me help make
it simpler.

117
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,368
Say you didn't have
to kill him yourself.

118
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:31,104
‐ But I'm the one with access.
You just said it.

119
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:32,839
‐ You're also my best friend.

120
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:33,950
If you can find his weakness,

121
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:36,018
I'll find a way you don't have
to be the one to do it,

122
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,110
I promise.

123
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:38,945
‐ How?

124
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:42,516
‐ I have no fucking idea,

125
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,684
but I'll figure it out
for you, okay?

126
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:47,521
‐ Okay.

127
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:00,834
‐ You took the thing,
the panel.

128
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,302
You can't just‐‐

129
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,070
this is mass floricide.

130
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:05,705
‐ Sorry, I had
to bring the panel here

131
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:07,974
so I could study it.

132
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:10,343
‐ Sorry, I can't hear you
over my plants dying.

133
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:13,480
‐ Is this
a western‐facing window?

134
00:05:13,513 --> 00:05:15,048
‐ And how we have
a working classroom

135
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:18,218
because, you know, school
for magicians, not flowers.

136
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,887
‐ Took the botany job 'cause
you fixed up the greenhouse.

137
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:22,989
Should've known you'd just
turn around and wreck it.

138
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:24,658
Here, let me explain
how that feels.

139
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:26,126
‐ Hey!

140
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:29,863
Wait, don't touch that.

141
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:30,664
‐ Huh.

142
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:32,065
Thick venation
through the leaves,

143
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:33,867
and look at the asymmetry here.

144
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,402
‐ Wait, do you recognize it?

145
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:37,504
‐ Don't think it's terrestrial.

146
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:38,872
You'd need
a classification expert

147
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:40,841
with the right magical tools.

148
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:43,643
I know a taxonomist
that's been around,

149
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,579
you know, the multiverse.

150
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:47,881
‐ Well, do you think
we can get him to come here?

151
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:49,616
‐ Don't see why not.

152
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,585
‐ I'll tell you why not.

153
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:54,387
Your pal Raylan is on
the dean's "Do Not Admit" list.

154
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:55,832
‐ You're Acting Dean.
Can't you just‐‐

155
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,123
‐ Alice.

156
00:05:57,157 --> 00:05:58,491
‐ He's a botanist.

157
00:05:58,525 --> 00:05:59,426
‐ Yes!

158
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,494
Who visited a world
called Anansia,

159
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,330
home to some
highly infectious shit.

160
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,265
‐ He's still alive, isn't he?

161
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,234
Magical phytologists
do crazy shit,

162
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:09,035
but Ray's smart.

163
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:12,539
I doubt he's carrying
anything... well, dangerous.

164
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:13,573
‐ No offense,

165
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:15,508
but I'm gonna trust the file
with the red stamp.

166
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,086
‐ Look, the only place
on Earth right now

167
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,112
with magic stable enough
for Ray to examine it

168
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,114
is in our lab, thanks to me

169
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:23,216
installing the Circumstances
Control Panel for you.

170
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,752
‐ Don't you think figuring out
the deal with magic

171
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,721
is more important than
translating some page

172
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:30,624
you found about a plant?

173
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:32,292
‐ I found it in Quentin's desk.

174
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:39,733
This thing, it makes no sense

175
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,568
except it was important to Q,

176
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:44,504
so maybe it's important
we figure out what it is.

177
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,845
‐ If we test him thoroughly

178
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,314
and he's clean,

179
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,815
he can come.

180
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,359
‐ Uh‐‐hey, Fen.
‐ Yeah?

181
00:07:06,393 --> 00:07:07,470
‐ Can I ask you something?
‐ Yeah.

182
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:12,165
‐ Um, lately I've just been
feeling a little bit off.

183
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:15,068
If we were on Earth,
I'd know what to do, but...

184
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,304
is there, like, a magic plant
or something out here

185
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:20,240
that I can pee on
to find out if I'm‐‐

186
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:22,075
‐ Pregnant!

187
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,643
‐ Shit.

188
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:24,511
‐ Sorry.

189
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:25,855
God, I don't know
why I'm crying, just‐‐

190
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:28,915
babies, ahh!

191
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,984
Um, do you know
what you're gonna do?

192
00:07:31,017 --> 00:07:34,788
‐ Um, I'm not so sure.

193
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,823
‐ Do you want me
to send a bunny to Penny?

194
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:40,593
‐ Uh, Penny and I are just‐‐

195
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,028
we're sort of in a weird place.

196
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:43,530
‐ Oh.

197
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:45,932
‐ Actually, until I've had
some time to process,

198
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,576
I'd really appreciate
if we could keep this

199
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,702
between you and I, please?

200
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,279
‐ Of course.
I'm really good with secrets.

201
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,707
I've kept Eliot's fear of
butterflies secret for years.

202
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,408
Until now, shit!

203
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:56,585
Sorry, I won't do that
with you.

204
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,078
‐ Pregnant.

205
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,649
‐ Made macarons.

206
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:06,252
Mango yuzu and matcha.
Anyone?

207
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:08,088
‐ Why?

208
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:10,557
‐ For sustenance?
You love them.

209
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,658
‐ Nice try, Hoberman.

210
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:13,994
We're on mission,
so no distractions.

211
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,028
Out.

212
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,529
‐ Sorry for interrupting.

213
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,268
‐ Can you believe that guy?

214
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:24,838
‐ What are you talking about?
You eat matcha everything.

215
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:26,106
‐ Those macarons were a trap.

216
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:27,640
Josh is an emotional ninja.

217
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:30,210
He comes at you with sweets,
and then you just

218
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:31,344
confess things.

219
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:35,248
‐ So you're still avoiding
that conversation you owe him

220
00:08:35,281 --> 00:08:37,450
about leaving him in the past.

221
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:38,284
‐ That is not gonna
be a good talk,

222
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:40,587
so we're not gonna have it.

223
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,764
We have real things
to worry about,

224
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,666
like how you're gonna find out
the Dark King's secret.

225
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,393
‐ And we can't
enjoy mango yuzu macarons

226
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:47,494
while we worry about that?

227
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,430
‐ Never take the food, Eliot.

228
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,499
‐

229
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,134
‐ Which gives me an idea.

230
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:58,738
‐ Seb, I brought you something.

231
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:01,641
Oh, my God.

232
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:07,981
Are you okay?

233
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,283
‐ Six children.

234
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:13,953
Six children taken.

235
00:09:13,987 --> 00:09:15,522
It's my fault.

236
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,458
If I'd have been there,
I could've stopped them.

237
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:21,961
Being a king‐‐

238
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:24,130
nobody knows
what it's really like.

239
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:29,903
‐ Seb...

240
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,606
do you think you could ever
step down?

241
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,643
‐ I have to be king.

242
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,711
‐ You don't have
to be anything.

243
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:42,982
I could help you.

244
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:50,490
‐ Eliot,
I appreciate your concern

245
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,659
more than I can say.

246
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:55,595
This is my burden.

247
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,063
I can't leave.

248
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,299
‐ Is it something we can fix?

249
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:01,534
A spell or a curse
of some kind.

250
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:03,603
‐ A choice

251
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:07,307
I made a long time ago,

252
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,175
tied to a conduit.

253
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,344
I thought it was the only way
I could save Fillory.

254
00:10:11,377 --> 00:10:13,947
‐ A conduit?
What do you mean?

255
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,915
‐ It was a lifetime ago.

256
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:19,519
So many lifetimes ago.

257
00:10:25,725 --> 00:10:28,194
‐ We could just
get out of here.

258
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:31,998
We could
just go camping or, um...

259
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:00,026
‐ I'm sorry.

260
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:03,329
I forgot myself.

261
00:11:05,098 --> 00:11:06,499
‐ Look, Seb,
we can make this okay.

262
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:08,468
‐ Perhaps we shouldn't
see each other again.

263
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,354
‐ Sorry, Ray.

264
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:31,925
I gotta test you
for spine‐burrowing spiders.

265
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:34,894
You know the drill.
Chew, don't swallow.

266
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:42,302
‐ Your Primula scotica isobelae
is flourishing, Baxie.

267
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:43,736
‐ Spit.

268
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:48,875
‐ Everyone's panties untwisted?

269
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:50,777
‐ Because it turned purple?

270
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,245
‐ Purple is good,

271
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,614
uncontrollably shitting spiders
is bad.

272
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,249
‐ Ray, what do you make of‐‐

273
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:58,484
‐
All right, Glasses.

274
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:01,054
I'm going to say a word
that you don't know.

275
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:02,121
Phyllotaxis.

276
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:04,557
‐ The arrangement of leaves
around a central stalk.

277
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:06,292
‐ Oh, you're one of those?

278
00:12:06,326 --> 00:12:08,194
‐ Says the arrogant,
dime‐a‐dozen academic

279
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,762
with a plant fetish.

280
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:11,340
‐ But later when you recount
how you told me off,

281
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:14,100
I'm sure you'll punch it up
to be more of a dick chop.

282
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:15,435
Looks chaotic, but it's not.

283
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:16,970
If follows
a mathematical sequence.

284
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:17,971
The leaves of this plant

285
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:20,073
suggest that its origin
is exceptionally exotic.

286
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:21,417
‐ Or it is just
a made‐up drawing.

287
00:12:21,441 --> 00:12:22,542
‐ To an amateur,

288
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,811
I could see that being
the easiest explanation, yes,

289
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,579
but no.
No, this has something.

290
00:12:26,613 --> 00:12:29,048
Plants, they have a certain
integrity to them, hmm?

291
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:30,049
It's hard to fake that.

292
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,818
‐ Do you think
you can identify it?

293
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:34,387
‐ Only guy who can.
‐ Mm, joy.

294
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,622
‐ Would you be a sweetie

295
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:38,858
and get me a spectral‐reactive
phytometer, a Bertric lens,

296
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:39,993
and a pamplemousse LaCroix?

297
00:12:40,026 --> 00:12:41,227
‐
‐ Happy to.

298
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,630
‐ No.
If I stay, I might kill him.

299
00:12:54,474 --> 00:12:57,510
‐ The Dark King's immortal
because of a conduit?

300
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,479
Like, a vitality conduit?

301
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:01,581
‐ Do we know what that is?

302
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:04,217
‐ Guess not.

303
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,686
It's an old naturalist ritual.

304
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:10,123
Draw life force from a stalk
of corn to fight a summer cold,

305
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:10,990
that sort of thing.

306
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:12,959
‐ Seb's immortality
comes from corn?

307
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,694
‐ What about a tree?

308
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:15,795
He had a tattoo of one

309
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:18,631
with what looked like
maple leaves, only more jagged.

310
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:19,766
‐ Oh!

311
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,868
‐ You can just talk.

312
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,102
‐ Uh, that's a Blackwood tree.

313
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,871
‐ Okay, so what if we locate

314
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,839
the tree from Seb's
tattoo and chop it down?

315
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:28,308
Would that sever this conduit?

316
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:30,310
‐ In theory, yes.

317
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:33,680
He would be mortal
and 100% stab‐able.

318
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:34,890
‐ So how do we find this tree?

319
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:37,784
‐ Who has two thumbs and aced
their elective in dousing?

320
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:42,388
Probably safer
to send two of us, though.

321
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,324
Just in case something
goes wrong.

322
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:46,592
‐ Well, I'm
a former tree goddess, I'll go.

323
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:48,094
‐ No!

324
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:51,164
You can't go on a long hike
because you have the...

325
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:52,498
toe worms.

326
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:55,401
‐ Oh right, my toe worms.

327
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:57,403
‐ I thought that was just
a wooden toe thing.

328
00:13:57,437 --> 00:13:58,438
‐ You thought wrong.

329
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:01,307
There's a lot of misinformation
about toe worms.

330
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,843
I have them.
You gonna make me take a hike?

331
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:06,746
‐ No.
No worm shame here.

332
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,616
- Okay. How about you, Margo?
- ‐

333
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,984
‐ Could use
your Centurion skills

334
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:13,820
with all the Takers out there.

335
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,097
‐ If you do that,
it'll just leave me,

336
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:16,923
and I kind of have a problem.

337
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:19,659
After our last talk, Seb
told me to stay away from him,

338
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:20,727
so I don't really think

339
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,428
I'm in a position to, you know,

340
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:23,863
stab him.

341
00:14:23,896 --> 00:14:25,865
‐ Yeah,
but what if he needs you?

342
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:27,467
You're his Magician advisor.

343
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,468
Fen and I will come up
with a problem

344
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:30,670
that takes two Magicians
to fix‐‐

345
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,106
assuming
our toes can handle it.

346
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:36,209
‐ It'll be touch‐and‐go.

347
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:39,278
‐ Okay, but what if
the Dark King can feel it

348
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:42,215
when we chop down the tree
and we have to act quickly?

349
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:45,351
I just don't know how quick
I can be, given everything.

350
00:14:45,385 --> 00:14:49,422
‐ Don't worry.
We'll make it work.

351
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:51,424
‐ The fuck, Margo?
You promised.

352
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:52,859
‐ And I meant it.

353
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:56,095
You won't be the one
to kill Seb, exactly.

354
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,006
‐ Why are you being so weird
and tricky about this?

355
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,165
I thought I was clear.

356
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,234
Thank you.

357
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:02,301
‐ Wait.

358
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,504
‐

359
00:15:05,772 --> 00:15:08,207
That is the worst mojito I have
ever had in my entire life.

360
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,143
‐ That's because not a mojito.

361
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:11,110
It's a potion.

362
00:15:11,144 --> 00:15:13,613
I was gonna explain
before you got all grabby,

363
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,448
but I guess here we go.

364
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,584
Ugh.

365
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:23,423
Seb needs to die.
You can't do it, but I can.

366
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:24,624
So get ready to‐‐.

367
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:27,093
Ovary up, bitch.

368
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:35,234
‐ Margo, did we just
"Freaky Friday?"

369
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:46,913
‐ Bax!

370
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:50,883
‐

371
00:15:50,917 --> 00:15:51,884
‐ What did you do to him?

372
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:54,220
‐ He's fine, he's fine.

373
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:56,055
‐ Give me my page back.

374
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,490
‐ Look‐‐

375
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:58,958
I will buy it from you.

376
00:15:58,991 --> 00:15:59,926
Name your price.

377
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,761
‐ Put it down now.

378
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:09,469
‐

379
00:16:11,671 --> 00:16:13,506
‐ Holy shit.

380
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:16,309
‐ I just pushed him.
It shouldn't have done that.

381
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,483
What the hell was that?

382
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,485
‐ We need to seal this room.

383
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:32,263
‐ Jesus, Bambi.
That was kind of nonconsensual.

384
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,102
‐ You drank
before I could explain.

385
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,896
I have been trying
to figure out to help you.

386
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,397
This is the only way
I could think of

387
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:40,833
to keep your hands clean
of Seb's murder.

388
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:42,077
‐ Except they literally
won't be.

389
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,102
Those are my hands.

390
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,904
‐ Look, you're the one
who can get close,

391
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,672
I'm the one
with the will to stab.

392
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:52,111
El, I love you,
but we have to do this thing.

393
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,946
Even you agree with that.

394
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:59,452
This is the best compromise
I could come up with.

395
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:01,020
So listen up‐‐
this spell's got

396
00:17:01,053 --> 00:17:03,589
a little quirk
you should probably know about.

397
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:06,826
Tell anyone we've swapped and
we won't be able to swap back‐‐

398
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,327
permanently.

399
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,862
‐ That is good to know.

400
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:14,634
‐ Strange.

401
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:17,069
It's like you're Eliot
but not Eliot.

402
00:17:17,103 --> 00:17:19,272
‐ Oh my God,
you're seeing Charlton.

403
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:20,582
‐ What kind of a name
is Charlton?

404
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,141
‐ Family name.
I never liked it.

405
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:23,643
‐ He lives in my head‐‐
your head.

406
00:17:23,676 --> 00:17:25,611
‐ And why is there a man living
in your head?

407
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:28,881
‐ Charlton and I
were Monster victims together.

408
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:32,218
He stayed in my head when
you pulled the Monster out.

409
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:33,819
‐ I held on real tight.

410
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:37,223
‐ So if he's in your head,
why didn't he swap with you?

411
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:38,758
‐ I have no idea.

412
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,326
Honestly, this is all very new.

413
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:43,195
I'd have given you a heads‐up
if I'd known your plan.

414
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:43,996
‐ Listen.

415
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,866
Charlie,
stay the fuck out of my way.

416
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:47,800
‐ Hey, Bambi?

417
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:48,868
Before you go all...

418
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,836
Bambi, and scare him off,

419
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,573
why don't you maybe
let him help you?

420
00:17:53,606 --> 00:17:54,574
‐ I've managed just fine

421
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:57,009
without a Tyler Durden
up my cooch, thanks.

422
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:57,877
‐ I'm just saying

423
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,479
this Seb situation
is pretty complicated.

424
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:02,882
You're not exactly a...

425
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,750
subtle relationship person.

426
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:06,652
‐ From what I've seen,
he's right.

427
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:09,589
‐ He's gotta ride a really
fine line with the Dark King.

428
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:13,759
He lost his love,
but he likes me,

429
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:15,428
so that feels like a betrayal.

430
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,630
‐ That is a lot of drama
to track.

431
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:19,665
‐ What about you and Josh?

432
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:21,233
Since I'll be going
on a long walk

433
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:23,502
to cut down a tree with him,

434
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:25,037
is there anything
I should know?

435
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:26,105
‐ Yeah.

436
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:28,708
If Josh tries to pull you
into any kind of talk,

437
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:30,776
just don't.

438
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,078
‐

439
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,056
‐ I was a little surprised
to get your message

440
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,726
after our last convo.

441
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:49,562
‐ I know things
got complicated.

442
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,764
The circumstances have changed.

443
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,967
Castle has been struck
with a strange sleeping curse.

444
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:57,536
‐ Is that what happened to‐‐

445
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:58,604
wow.

446
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:00,873
‐ We've kept it quiet.

447
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:04,410
Obviously,
it requires a magical solution,

448
00:19:04,443 --> 00:19:06,345
but I'm afraid it's beyond me.

449
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:10,182
‐ I think I know this curse.

450
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:11,256
Good news, there's a cure.

451
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:15,221
Only prob: It takes a bit
of cooperative spellwork.

452
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:17,356
You need four hands to do it.

453
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,158
‐ I see.
‐ So you wanna solve this,

454
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:20,726
we're gonna have
to work together,

455
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,329
even if it makes uncomf
or whatevs.

456
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,131
‐ You sound strange.

457
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,866
‐

458
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,335
I haven't been feeling myself.

459
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:31,037
Since our last talk.

460
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:33,272
‐ Yes.

461
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:37,810
Let us work together
to solve this curious malady,

462
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:40,646
for the good of Fillory.

463
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,748
‐ That could've gone smoother.

464
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,597
‐ Sleeping pollen
worked like a charm.

465
00:19:58,631 --> 00:20:00,633
Or a curse, I guess.

466
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,202
Oh, Umber's balls.

467
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:06,338
Margo just keeps leaving
her uniform lying around.

468
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,641
Makes me feel like a maid.

469
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:10,776
Right.

470
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,879
Julia, let me take over.
Rest is good for the baby.

471
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:16,816
‐ Not a baby.
Still baking.

472
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:18,818
‐ But it'll become a baby.

473
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:21,654
You do know
how this works, right?

474
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:22,655
‐
Look, Fen,

475
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:24,356
I just want to live my life

476
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,727
without this defining
every aspect of it, you get me?

477
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,661
‐ Okay, well,
if that's the truth

478
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:30,996
then why haven't you
done something about it?

479
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,799
It's not a hard procedure,
not even in Fillory.

480
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,101
‐ You think I should abort it?

481
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:38,804
‐ I'm saying
you should make a choice.

482
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:40,873
You're letting something
into your life

483
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:44,643
that you can't control and in
lots of ways will control you.

484
00:20:44,677 --> 00:20:47,379
It'll make you happy,

485
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,181
or devastate you.

486
00:20:51,183 --> 00:20:52,183
‐ Yeah.

487
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:56,222
Look,
I've been pregnant before,

488
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,424
and it was really bad.

489
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:00,993
And I knew this time
if I told everyone about it,

490
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:03,262
they'd get worried
and overprotective

491
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:06,232
and I just wanted to take one
of the next nine months

492
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:09,802
to feel like maybe this time

493
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:11,437
it wouldn't be so terrible,
you know?

494
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,573
‐ Nine months?
What are you talking about?

495
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,108
It's Red Monkey Month.

496
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:17,042
‐ Red Monkey what?

497
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:19,745
‐ Everything goes faster
in Red Monkey Month.

498
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,214
Healing, crop growth,

499
00:21:22,248 --> 00:21:23,482
weirdly, not monkeys.

500
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:24,316
‐ I'm sorry,
are you saying that

501
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,886
my pregnancy
is going to be sped up?

502
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:28,621
‐ Julia, it already is.

503
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:29,989
As long as you stay in Fillory.

504
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:32,324
‐ Oh, Jesus Christ.

505
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:35,261
‐

506
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:41,600
‐ Get the fuck away from me.

507
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:42,701
‐ What's wrong?

508
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:45,471
‐ I thought I saw a butterfly.

509
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:48,274
You never know
where they're gonna go next.

510
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,743
‐ Lavender rose macaron?
I know they're your favorite.

511
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:51,744
‐ I'd better not.

512
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:54,947
‐ Margo, it's a snack,
not a trap.

513
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,421
‐ You're a really good baker.

514
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,292
Also taller from this POV.

515
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,760
‐ I learned
to dial in that recipe

516
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:09,328
while I was stuck in the past.

517
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:11,030
Fen had her knives,

518
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:12,198
I had baking.

519
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:13,098
‐ Oh, yeah.

520
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:14,767
That must've been tough
for you both.

521
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,668
‐ It was.

522
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:18,003
I mean‐‐sorry,
I didn't mean to bring it up.

523
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:19,538
We don't have to talk about it.

524
00:22:19,572 --> 00:22:20,916
‐ Okay.
How much further, you think?

525
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,708
‐ It's just
we thought we lost you guys,

526
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:24,743
and it was a scary time, so...

527
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:26,846
‐ So we must be
getting near Seb's tree, huh?

528
00:22:26,879 --> 00:22:29,315
‐ Are we really
not gonna do this?

529
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,851
Look, I'd be lying
if I said it didn't hurt

530
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:33,619
when you wanted
to abandon me in the past,

531
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:36,288
but I know it wasn't about me.

532
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:38,190
Still, Margo, I have to ask.

533
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:39,525
Do you wanna break up?

534
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:42,394
I mean, are we even
a thing that can be broken up?

535
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:44,063
‐ I‐‐

536
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:46,332
what do you think?

537
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,944
‐ Sometimes I feel like
that's what you want.

538
00:22:48,968 --> 00:22:51,170
Look, when we got together,
I said I wasn't into games,

539
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,105
and do you remember
what you said?

540
00:22:53,138 --> 00:22:54,473
‐ Oh.

541
00:22:54,506 --> 00:22:56,375
‐ You said, "Fuck games."

542
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,043
‐ That does sound like me.

543
00:22:58,077 --> 00:23:00,312
‐ I can accept it's over
if you just say the words.

544
00:23:00,346 --> 00:23:01,280
‐ Josh, I wanna talk.

545
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:03,816
I really do, but I can't.

546
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:07,920
Except to say

547
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,655
that maybe I need
a little more time

548
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:11,857
to forgive myself.

549
00:23:12,925 --> 00:23:16,161
‐ Oh.
Uh, really?

550
00:23:16,195 --> 00:23:17,529
‐ Yes!

551
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:18,697
Because I've realized

552
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,966
that deciding to leave you
in the past was a mistake‐‐

553
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,401
a big one.

554
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:25,004
And now I need
to earn your forgiveness,

555
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:26,472
which may take a while,

556
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:29,608
so we can kind of
keep things status quo

557
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:30,743
in the meantime.

558
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:32,311
‐ I‐‐

559
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:34,179
sure, sure.

560
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:34,914
‐ Great.

561
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:36,582
Now, which way to the tree?

562
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:37,615
‐ Uh...

563
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,860
‐ I think Ray
was hosting a symbiote.

564
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:50,062
‐ He was possessed?
‐ Not possessed.

565
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,331
It's rare, but a few
fungus species have been known

566
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,300
to join consciousness
with other creatures.

567
00:23:54,333 --> 00:23:57,336
You're still you, you just
share brainpower, thoughts.

568
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:59,038
‐ And then you explode.

569
00:23:59,071 --> 00:24:00,081
‐ Well, I'm not a mushroom guy,

570
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,774
but I think that's because.

571
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:04,610
Ray merged with the fungus
a long, long time ago.

572
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,845
‐ Is he‐‐
shit, are they dead?

573
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:08,047
‐ Ray is,

574
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,016
but those particles that came
out of him were fungal spores.

575
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:13,085
They'll want a new host body.

576
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,586
‐ I sealed them inside the lab,

577
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,689
but it might be a good idea
to close the air vents.

578
00:24:16,722 --> 00:24:18,791
‐ Yeah, hi.
New to this job.

579
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:21,560
I have no idea how
to control the school vents.

580
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:22,728
We need to evacuate.

581
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:24,630
Knew I should've trusted
my instincts.

582
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:32,104
Hey, hey!
There's a, um‐‐

583
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:33,005
‐ Eukaryotic photosymbiont.

584
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,007
‐ Yeah, there's a monster
on the loose.

585
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,544
Head to the Physical Kids'
Cottage to be quarantined now.

586
00:24:42,915 --> 00:24:44,750
‐ Alice, give us
the plant page‐‐

587
00:24:44,783 --> 00:24:46,819
‐ Then we'll stop spreading.

588
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,790
‐ Oh, oh.
Okay!

589
00:24:53,025 --> 00:24:55,761
‐ New theory: The fungus can
spread to multiple hosts.

590
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:57,138
This might be a zombie plague
situation.

591
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,630
‐ What?
‐ What?

592
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,032
‐ I say this is the man
who blew up my Brakebills.

593
00:25:10,109 --> 00:25:12,077
You're the worst goddamn dean
we've ever had.

594
00:25:12,111 --> 00:25:15,681
‐ Yeah, I'm not here
for a lecture from my prisoner.

595
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:16,815
Just hiding from spores.

596
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:18,017
‐ Oh, so you remember

597
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,486
that this room
is hermetically sealed,

598
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,654
but not to consult
the "Do Not Admit" list?

599
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,723
‐ I did everything a dean
is supposed to do.

600
00:25:24,757 --> 00:25:27,659
‐ A dean is supposed
to have strong instincts,

601
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:29,695
like knowing anyone
who'd visit Anansia

602
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:32,498
is also insane enough
to visit other worlds

603
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,134
with infections
for which we cannot test.

604
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:37,236
‐ DO you want to help or what?
‐ Yes.

605
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:39,605
I can provide a solution‐‐

606
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:41,273
in exchange for my release.

607
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:42,941
‐ How do we know
you really have one?

608
00:25:42,975 --> 00:25:46,211
‐ I developed a potion
with a Dr. Maria Pilkin.

609
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:49,014
You can check with her.

610
00:25:49,048 --> 00:25:50,482
But‐‐

611
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:53,919
she died in this timeline.

612
00:25:53,952 --> 00:25:56,055
‐ No deal.

613
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:57,689
We'll find our own way.

614
00:25:57,723 --> 00:25:59,925
‐ You cannot save your students
without my help.

615
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:02,161
‐ See, in our timeline.

616
00:26:02,194 --> 00:26:04,963
Pilkin's work was published
after her death,

617
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:06,965
so it's in our library.

618
00:26:08,534 --> 00:26:11,470
‐ Gave away your leverage.

619
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,806
Thought a dean was supposed
to have strong instincts.

620
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:16,442
‐ I will get out of here,

621
00:26:16,475 --> 00:26:20,479
and then I'll turn you
into lobsters

622
00:26:20,512 --> 00:26:21,847
and eat you.

623
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,382
‐ Uh, okay.

624
00:26:35,494 --> 00:26:37,329
‐ Okay, the book we need
is right there.

625
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:38,197
‐ See any twitching?

626
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,965
‐ Just assume
they're all infected.

627
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:41,934
‐ And assume
they're all looking for us.

628
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:43,378
It's too risky for us
to go in together.

629
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:45,504
‐ I know where it is.
I'll go.

630
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:46,572
‐ Hey.

631
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,907
Remember, magic is
unpredictable outside the lab.

632
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,009
‐ So no phosphoromancy.

633
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:52,153
Good thing I have experience

634
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:54,480
being invisible
from high school.

635
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,779
Ooh, ooh.

636
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:01,812
‐

637
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:04,816
‐ You got us the book
and a guinea pig.

638
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,285
Nice work.

639
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:08,954
‐ It said the potion
should work fast.

640
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:13,559
‐

641
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,800
‐ Penny.

642
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,235
‐ Oh, shit.

643
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:24,536
‐ Penny.

644
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:28,340
‐ Just give up the page, Alice.

645
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:37,749
‐

646
00:28:37,783 --> 00:28:40,152
‐

647
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:41,320
‐ Almost ready.

648
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:42,454
‐ Great.

649
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:43,922
‐ Uh...

650
00:28:43,956 --> 00:28:46,091
Margo, you have
to draw this out.

651
00:28:46,124 --> 00:28:47,535
The second they wake,
Seb will dismiss you.

652
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,094
‐ No shit, Sherlock.

653
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:50,963
This is all part of my plan
to win him over.

654
00:28:50,996 --> 00:28:52,331
‐ How is finishing the ritual

655
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:54,166
early and in silence
part of your plan?

656
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:56,335
‐ Because I taught it
to him wrong,

657
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:59,037
so to fix it, I'm gonna have
to get real close and personal.

658
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,872
‐
‐ Eliot?

659
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:02,784
Something in the middle section
doesn't feeling right.

660
00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:04,252
The energies aren't moving
as they should.

661
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:05,811
‐ Hmm.

662
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:07,246
I can walk you through it.

663
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:15,954
Wait.

664
00:29:15,988 --> 00:29:17,756
That's not right.

665
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:21,827
Here.

666
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,401
‐ We should keep our distance.

667
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,603
It will make things easier.

668
00:29:31,637 --> 00:29:33,205
‐ Right.

669
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:34,439
Of course.

670
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,377
‐ If you need my help,
just ask.

671
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:39,311
‐ Jesus' clits.

672
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:41,380
I know how to work a guy,
Charlton.

673
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:43,482
‐ Yes.
You do, Margo.

674
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:45,284
As Eliot, you're coming on
too strong.

675
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:47,286
Seb likes
Eliot's vulnerability.

676
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:49,988
Don't be pushy,
just open up.

677
00:29:50,022 --> 00:29:53,825
He and Eliot are close because
of the losses they share.

678
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:57,696
‐

679
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:00,265
I can show you the rest
if you're ready.

680
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:03,268
But first,
I think I owe you an apology.

681
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:05,871
‐ Eliot, that's not necessary.
‐ It's just‐‐

682
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:09,141
I haven't felt this way
in a really long time.

683
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:12,611
I think the fact that we both‐‐

684
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,080
it just felt safe with you,
you know?

685
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:20,252
‐ On that mountain
we both felt it.

686
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:22,888
There's nothing wrong
with wanting more.

687
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:26,658
I wish I could give you more,
but I just can't.

688
00:30:26,692 --> 00:30:30,395
I must put Fillory first,
even if it means I suffer.

689
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:34,266
I do hope you understand that.

690
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,535
‐ I get it.

691
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:38,737
It's hard to be king.

692
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,706
People don't know
what you go through.

693
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:47,546
Now let me show you how
to do that spell correctly.

694
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:04,696
‐ Are we close to the tree?

695
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,631
I don't mean to rush.
You're the expert.

696
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:08,567
‐ Okay, that's it.

697
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,301
I'm not buying it.

698
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:12,137
‐ Not buying what?
‐ Any of this.

699
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,673
‐ Emotional,
agreeable, patient?

700
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:15,674
You're not Margo.

701
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:16,908
‐ Who else would I be?

702
00:31:16,942 --> 00:31:18,944
‐ This is Fillory.
I don't know.

703
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:22,848
You could be a hallucination,
or‐‐or a shapeshifter,

704
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,816
or an agent of the Dark King.

705
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:27,786
‐ But I'm not.
Josh, I'm‐‐

706
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:29,588
shit.

707
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:30,756
I wish I could explain.

708
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:34,726
‐ Oh, well, until you do,
I'm not taking you to the tree.

709
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:37,529
Got it?

710
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:48,549
‐ The antifungal
kind of worked.

711
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,908
We got the spores out of him.

712
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:51,176
‐ Yeah, and into Penny.

713
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:53,745
‐ It must be the fungus'
networking ability.

714
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:54,822
Long as it's alive
in other hosts,

715
00:31:54,846 --> 00:31:57,149
it can still direct its spores
into whoever it wants.

716
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:59,284
‐ So why not into us?
We were right there.

717
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:01,253
‐ Penny was closer?

718
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:02,587
‐ I thought you were an expert.

719
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:03,798
‐ I told you
this isn't my area.

720
00:32:03,822 --> 00:32:07,592
At this point, my best advice?
Give the fungus what it wants.

721
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:09,194
‐ No.

722
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:12,097
Ever since I found this page
I knew it was important.

723
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:14,666
If the fungus wants it,
I was right.

724
00:32:14,699 --> 00:32:16,034
I have to know what it means.

725
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:17,769
‐ Is it worth dying over?

726
00:32:17,803 --> 00:32:18,913
Is that what Quentin
would want?

727
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,672
For you to die, too?

728
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:22,507
‐ Back the fuck off, botanist.

729
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:26,378
‐ Sorry.
Maybe I overstepped.

730
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:27,479
It's just...

731
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:32,417
Remember that plant I put
on the windowsill in the lab?

732
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:34,286
‐ Yeah, you only screamed
at me about it.

733
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,921
‐ Scottish primrose.

734
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,098
It's this
fragile little flower.

735
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:38,290
Even grass can kill it,

736
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:43,061
so it has to survive on cliff
walls where nothing else can.

737
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:45,964
It was my wife Isobel's
favorite.

738
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:51,670
‐ Primula scotica isobelae.
You named it after her?

739
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:54,473
‐ You remembered the name.

740
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:57,943
She loved that stupid flower.

741
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,811
Kept it alive
without any spellwork.

742
00:32:59,845 --> 00:33:02,047
Huge point of pride.

743
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,217
But I thought it was just
kind of silly.

744
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:11,156
Then she died,
so now I keep it alive.

745
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:13,225
If it's anything like that,

746
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:16,027
I get why you'd
wanna keep that page.

747
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:21,166
‐ How long ago?

748
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:24,035
‐ Five years.
You?

749
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:26,505
‐ A lot less.

750
00:33:26,538 --> 00:33:30,008
So how long until, you know,
it feels

751
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:32,410
less like it's eating
all of you?

752
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:34,913
‐ I'm kind of still waiting.

753
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:37,549
‐ I just feel like I'm gonna be

754
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:39,918
this walking whatever‐I‐am
forever.

755
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:42,354
‐ I did too.

756
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:45,390
It starts like
this tight ball in your chest,

757
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:47,726
but over time, it gets lighter

758
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:52,497
because it just kind of spreads
into the rest of you.

759
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,466
‐ It's like your own personal
symbiote.

760
00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:57,369
‐
Yeah, kind of.

761
00:33:57,402 --> 00:34:01,439
Except not murderous
and weirdly paper‐focused.

762
00:34:01,473 --> 00:34:03,975
Just, uh...

763
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:05,944
sad.

764
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:06,977
‐ Yeah.

765
00:34:08,914 --> 00:34:11,349
‐ Make it to a year.

766
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:15,687
It'll still suck,
but it gets quieter.

767
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,756
I promise.

768
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:27,632
‐ Shit.

769
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:29,067
I know what to do.

770
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:35,941
‐ Damn.

771
00:34:35,974 --> 00:34:39,444
I actually felt bad for him,
for what he's been through.

772
00:34:39,477 --> 00:34:42,080
‐ He's a nice man,
but an evil king.

773
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:43,815
‐ It doesn't make sense.

774
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:45,917
He seems kind.

775
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:49,254
He seems sad.

776
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:52,891
Why the fuck would he summon
those monsters into Fillory?

777
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,726
‐ Eliot.

778
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:58,763
I think we're finished.
It worked.

779
00:34:58,797 --> 00:35:01,499
Before you go,
perhaps we should talk?

780
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:05,980
‐ I don't know
why he summoned them,

781
00:35:06,004 --> 00:35:08,244
but I don't think we're gonna
get another chance at this.

782
00:35:19,918 --> 00:35:21,853
‐ Not as easy as it looks,
is it?

783
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:24,155
‐ Josh, please.

784
00:35:24,189 --> 00:35:25,333
Eliot's waiting for the signal.

785
00:35:25,357 --> 00:35:27,001
If we don't chop down the tree,
he's screwed.

786
00:35:27,025 --> 00:35:27,892
We're screwed!

787
00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:29,794
‐ You said
you wish you could explain.

788
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:32,664
That means there's something
to explain, so explain.

789
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:34,475
‐ So you've been wanting
to talk to me for weeks

790
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:37,836
about what happened between us,
but when I finally apologize

791
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:39,971
you accuse me
of being possessed.

792
00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:41,373
‐ Right, apologize.

793
00:35:41,406 --> 00:35:42,683
Does that sound like Margo
to you?

794
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:44,075
‐ Fine!

795
00:35:44,109 --> 00:35:45,810
Maybe I was saying
what you wanted to hear,

796
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:47,879
'cause you never let up.

797
00:35:47,912 --> 00:35:49,323
You keep trying to get me
to talk about something

798
00:35:49,347 --> 00:35:51,383
I don't wanna talk about.

799
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:53,685
‐ Okay.
Fine, I get that.

800
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:54,686
‐ You wanna know the truth?

801
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,888
You picked someone
who will never put your first.

802
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:59,524
There's no fixing Margo‐‐
I mean me,

803
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:01,526
'cause chances are
if I had to relive it,

804
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,228
I'd make the same decision.

805
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:05,597
So stop asking me
to apologize for something

806
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,732
I don't feel sorry about.

807
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:12,904
‐ Now you sound like you.

808
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:15,240
‐ Not that I won't
feel differently tomorrow.

809
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:19,310
‐ No, you won't.
You're very clear.

810
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:21,312
The Conduit Tree's
that one over there.

811
00:36:21,346 --> 00:36:22,347
Cut it down.

812
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,115
I'll give Eliot
the green light.

813
00:36:24,949 --> 00:36:26,184
‐ Oh, God.

814
00:36:28,153 --> 00:36:28,987
‐ I'm fine here.

815
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,056
Go help the others
search the castle

816
00:36:31,089 --> 00:36:33,758
for any remaining victims
of the sleeping curse.

817
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,801
What you said last night‐‐

818
00:36:42,834 --> 00:36:44,302
did you mean it?

819
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:46,471
‐ Um...

820
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:47,706
‐ Oh, right.

821
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:50,642
Uh, Eliot asked Seb if he'd
consider giving up the throne.

822
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:52,711
He even offered to help him,
but Seb said no.

823
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:54,913
‐ Eliot, are you all right?

824
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:57,549
‐ Yes, sorry.

825
00:36:57,582 --> 00:36:58,950
Of course I meant it.

826
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:02,353
‐ Because I've been thinking.

827
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:03,864
‐ Margo, the candles.
That's the signal.

828
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,790
They cut down
Seb's tree.

829
00:37:05,824 --> 00:37:08,193
‐ Eliot?
‐ It's now or never.

830
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:16,034
‐ Eliot should be done by now.

831
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:23,374
‐ Well, they're in a hurry.
‐ Gods, we're in trouble.

832
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:24,609
Here, take my extra knife.

833
00:37:24,642 --> 00:37:25,376
‐ All the knives in the world

834
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,212
won't get us past
the Centurions.

835
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,414
‐ Do you have a better plan?

836
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:31,983
‐ Are you under a hex?
A witch's spell?

837
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:33,251
What's going on?

838
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:35,086
‐ I can explain.

839
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,189
Just‐‐there will be
serious consequences if I do.

840
00:37:38,223 --> 00:37:39,324
‐ No, you can't tell him.

841
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:40,468
Margo,
you'll be stuck in there.

842
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:41,569
‐ There will be
serious consequences

843
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:42,961
if you don't explain.

844
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:56,040
‐

845
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,994
‐ You asked and I'm here.

846
00:38:17,362 --> 00:38:18,563
So‐‐

847
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:21,399
you gonna give up the page
or make us spore you, too?

848
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,905
‐ I'll give it to you.

849
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:30,675
If you tell me why you want it.

850
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:34,145
‐ It's an instruction manual.
‐ For what?

851
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:36,147
‐ The World Seed.

852
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:37,916
It's magical botanical
organism.

853
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:40,552
Legend is, the seed
is pure potential.

854
00:38:40,585 --> 00:38:44,355
The right nurturing, it can
grow into almost everything‐‐

855
00:38:44,389 --> 00:38:46,724
even an entire world.

856
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:47,592
‐ Well, if you want the page,

857
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:49,694
does that mean
you already have the seed?

858
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:51,629
‐ We're done talking.

859
00:39:02,307 --> 00:39:04,342
Alice?

860
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:05,977
What are you doing to us?

861
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,612
‐ Me?

862
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:09,914
I'm just keeping you talking.

863
00:39:09,948 --> 00:39:11,182
All that shared brainpower

864
00:39:11,216 --> 00:39:13,251
and you never thought
to yourselves,

865
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:14,986
where's Bax?

866
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:15,987
‐

867
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,755
‐ I mean, you had us stumped
for a while.

868
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:20,058
It seemed like
if we got you out of one host

869
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:21,936
you'd just keep spreading
yourself to other ones,

870
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,328
but you didn't.

871
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:26,297
For some reason,
you were limiting yourself.

872
00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:28,867
Some of your spores
didn't try to spread.

873
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,401
Bax wasn't sure why

874
00:39:30,435 --> 00:39:34,472
because fungi
can typically grow and grow.

875
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:37,742
But you're also
a consciousness, like us.

876
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:42,146
And we have limits.

877
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:44,883
Try to juggle too much at once
and we're useless.

878
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:47,418
‐ It's a professor thing.
Just go with it.

879
00:39:47,452 --> 00:39:52,123
‐ So I have Bax spreading you
too thin to affect your hosts

880
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:54,092
mentally or physically.

881
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:58,029
You won't be able
to control them anymore.

882
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:58,897
‐ You're killing me.

883
00:39:58,930 --> 00:39:59,931
‐ No.

884
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:04,002
Don't worry, you'll be
a part of your host forever.

885
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:06,304
You're just getting quieter.

886
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,077
‐

887
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:24,122
This is
the worst fucking job ever.

888
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:27,725
‐ Penny, are you okay?

889
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:29,727
‐ Got your page.

890
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:31,963
‐ Did you know why
you wanted it?

891
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:35,199
‐ It's fading, but...

892
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:37,502
to sell.

893
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:40,638
There was this huge debt
to pay.

894
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:43,107
I don't know what for, but...

895
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:45,143
when The Couple came
to collect, we didn't‐‐

896
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:48,012
they didn't ask any questions.

897
00:40:48,046 --> 00:40:49,047
‐ A couple of?

898
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:52,083
‐ No.
The Couple.

899
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:55,853
Weird name, but I remember
feeling scared shitless.

900
00:40:55,887 --> 00:41:00,925
The Couple has power.
It has resources.

901
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:03,594
It's been looking for the
World Seed page a long time,

902
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,730
and they are not good people.

903
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:07,999
‐ And they know
I have what they want.

904
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:08,933
‐ I don't think that's gonna be

905
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:11,669
the last person or thing
to come after it.

906
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:15,440
The hell was Coldwater doing

907
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,809
with instructions
to something so powerful?

908
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:19,677
‐ Yeah.

909
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,614
I have no idea.

910
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:26,884
‐ Jesus Christ, El.
You had one job:

911
00:41:26,918 --> 00:41:28,720
Don't blow up
my relationship with Josh.

912
00:41:28,753 --> 00:41:29,721
And what did you do?

913
00:41:29,754 --> 00:41:30,621
‐ I'm sorry.

914
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,790
There's no way
to avoid that conversation.

915
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:36,027
He's just
so goddamn persistent.

916
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,195
‐ Tell me about it.

917
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:38,262
By the by,

918
00:41:38,296 --> 00:41:40,298
Charlton's gonna go hang out
in your beach memories

919
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,232
for a while.

920
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:43,201
Think the whole Seb thing
was hard on him.

921
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:46,004
‐ So um, what did
you and Seb talk about?

922
00:41:46,037 --> 00:41:48,840
You know, before?

923
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:50,174
‐ Don't do this to yourself.

924
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:51,876
‐ I ended your relationship.

925
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:54,746
Seems like I deserve whatever
pain's coming my way.

926
00:41:54,779 --> 00:41:56,948
‐ That wasn't your fault.

927
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:58,750
You were just dealing
with some shit I set up

928
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,051
way before you took over.

929
00:42:00,084 --> 00:42:01,753
‐ So in summation,

930
00:42:01,786 --> 00:42:04,655
we're both equally skilled at
destroying our own happiness?

931
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:06,457
‐ Yeah.

932
00:42:06,491 --> 00:42:10,161
Well, at least we used
our powers for good?

933
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,974
‐ How fucked up is it
that I miss him?

934
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:18,236
‐ El, there's
nothing wrong with you.

935
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:19,170
He was hot and complicated.

936
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:21,339
Those are the ones
worth banging.

937
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:23,608
You've just
had some shitty luck

938
00:42:23,641 --> 00:42:25,209
with boys so far,
that's all.

939
00:42:25,243 --> 00:42:27,178
It doesn't mean
you don't deserve love

940
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:30,314
or that you won't ever find it.

941
00:42:30,348 --> 00:42:33,785
‐ Well, at least I have
better luck with friends.

942
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:51,536
‐
