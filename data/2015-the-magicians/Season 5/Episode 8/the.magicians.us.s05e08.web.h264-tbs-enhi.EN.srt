It wants out.

When all the scary creatures
were pulled out,

00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,855
I held on tight as I could
in your happy place.

He can't cast there, so.

It's horrific.

‐ The Takers are swarming.
‐ It's my fault.

39
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,799
They're swarming because Seb
summoned them with a spell

using the gold I gave him.

00:01:40,667 --> 00:01:42,502
I didn't know
what he was gonna do with it.

He summons them

What?
We're all thinking it.

all about the sanctity of life,

51

and I found it very moving.

52

So, can't we, I don't know,
peacefully overthrow him?

The Dark King survived
seven assassination attempts

how are we gonna get
close enough to the Dark King

You gotta admit, El,
you're perfectly placed.

Plus, he's always dismissing

82
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:05,686
his guards
when you come around.

83
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:08,288
‐ Why does me liking somebody
always end up with them dying?

84
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,190
‐ You should
tell your friends, Eliot.

85
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,159
‐ That I don't want
to save Fillory

86
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,860
because I caught feelings?

87
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:14,937

they should know how you feel

before they try to make you
do something you regret.

89

Happens to all of us,

107

but how do we get crushes
out of our system?

I have to murder the guy

Fillory does need this,

tell me now.
