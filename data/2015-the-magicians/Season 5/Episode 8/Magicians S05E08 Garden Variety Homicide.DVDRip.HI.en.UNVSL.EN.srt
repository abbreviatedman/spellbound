That I don't want to save
Fillory because I caught feelings?

72
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,958
I'm saying, they should
know how you feel

now I have to murder the guy

94
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,067
I just hypothetically
slept with,

95
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:07,024
which is a thing that shouldn't really
happen to a person more than once.

do it, tell me now.

to be the one to do it. I promise.

00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:47,426
Actually, until I've had
some time to process, uh...

173
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,946
I'd really appreciate
it if we could keep this

174
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,598
between you and
I, please. Of course.

175
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:52,782
I'm really good with secrets.

176
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:55,469
I've kept Eliot's fear of
butterflies a secret for years.

177
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:57,971
Until now. Shit. (EXCLAIMS)

178
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:00,012
Sorry, I won't do that
with you. Pregnant.

179
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:06,884
Made macarons, mango yuzu

180
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,980
and matcha, anyone? Why?

181
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:14,792
For sustenance? You'll love
them. Nice try, Hoberman.

182
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:17,490
We're on mission. So,
no distractions. Out.

183
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,121
Sorry for interrupting.

184
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,465
Can you believe that guy?

185
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,803
What are you talking about?
You eat matcha everything.

186
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:30,844
Those macarons were a
trap. Josh is an emotional ninja.

187
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:34,813
He comes at you with sweets,
and then you just confess things.

188
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:40,586
So you're still avoiding that conversation
you owe him about leaving him in the past.

189
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,327
That is not going to be a good
talk, so we're not going to have it.

190
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,001
We have real
things to worry about,

191
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,469
like how you're going to find
out the Dark King's secret.

192
00:08:46,493 --> 00:08:48,325
(SIGHS) And we can't enjoy

193
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:50,887
mango yuzu macarons
while we worry about that?

194
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,592
Never take the food, Eliot.

195
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:55,734
(SIGHS)

196
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:57,594
Which gives me an idea.

197
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:02,535
Seb? I brought you
something. (GLASS BREAKS)

198
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:03,609
DARK KING: Oh, boy.

199
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05,342
Oh, my God.

200
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,714
Um, are you okay?

201
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,250
Six children.

202
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,147
Six children taken.

203
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,919
It's my fault.

204
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:21,791
If I had been there, I
could've stopped them.

205
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,928
Being a king,

206
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:28,100
nobody knows
what it's really like.

207
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,234
(SIGHS)

208
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:33,598
Seb,

209
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,705
do you think you
could ever step down?

210
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:42,914
I have to be King. You
don't have to be anything.

211
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,410
I could help you.

212
00:09:50,957 --> 00:09:53,984
Eliot. I appreciate your concern

213
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,087
more than I can say.

214
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:59,123
This is my burden.

215
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:03,067
I can't leave. Is it
something we can fix?

216
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:06,429
A spell, or a curse
of some kind?

217
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:10,101
A choice I made a long time ago.

218
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:13,976
Tied to a conduit.

219
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,411
I thought it was the only
way I could save Fillory.

220
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:18,850
A conduit? What do you mean?

221
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,978
(EXHALES) It was a lifetime ago.

222
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,618
So many lifetimes ago.

223
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,423
We could just get out of here.

224
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,328
We could just go
camping, or, um...

225
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:59,789
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

226
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:05,597
I'm sorry.

227
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,366
I forgot myself.

228
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,463
Look, Seb, we
can make this okay.

229
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:14,371
Perhaps we shouldn't
see each other again.

230
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:28,911
(INHALES SHARPLY)

231
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:37,194
Sorry, Ray. Got to test you
for spine-burrowing spiders.

232
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,263
You know the drill.

233
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,189
Chew, don't swallow.

234
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:47,697
Your <i>Primula scotica
isobelae</i> is flourishing, Baxie.

235
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,173
BAX: Spit.

236
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,003
Everyone's panties untwisted?

237
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,411
Because it turned purple?

238
00:11:56,516 --> 00:12:00,578
Purple is good, uncontrollably
shitting spiders is bad.

239
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:04,482
Ray, what do you make of...
(CLEARS THROAT) All right, Glasses.

240
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:08,255
I'm going to say a word that
you don't know. Phyllotaxis.

241
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:10,523
The arrangement of
leaves around a central stalk.

242
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:12,225
Oh-ho-ho, you're one of those.

243
00:12:12,298 --> 00:12:15,735
Hmm, says the arrogant, dime-a-dozen
academic with a plant fetish.

244
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,715
But later, when you
recount how you told me off,

245
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,890
I'm sure you'll punch it up
to be more of a dick chop.

246
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:21,673
It looks chaotic, but it's not.

247
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,300
It follows a
mathematical sequence.

248
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,311
The leaves of this plant suggest
that its origin is exceptionally exotic.

249
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,937
Or it is just a made-up drawing.

250
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:29,047
To an amateur,

251
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,155
I could see that being the
easiest explanation, yes.

252
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,311
But, no, no. This has something.

253
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,514
Plants, they have a certain integrity
to them. Mmm, it's hard to fake that.

254
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,251
Do you think you
can identify it?

255
00:12:38,324 --> 00:12:40,589
Only guy who can. Mmm, joy.

256
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,127
Would you be a
sweetie and get me

257
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:44,424
a spectral-reactive phytometer,

258
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,691
a Bertric lens

259
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,256
and a pamplemousse
LaCroix. (SCOFFS)

260
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,326
Happy to. No. If I
stay, I might kill him.

261
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,508
JOSH: The Dark King is
immortal because of a conduit?

262
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:08,179
Like a vitality conduit?
Do we know what that is?

263
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:10,790
I guess not.

264
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:13,790
It's an old naturalist ritual.

265
00:13:13,893 --> 00:13:17,591
Draw life force from a stalk
of corn to fight a summer cold.

266
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:20,190
That sort of thing. Seb's
immortality comes from corn?

267
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,759
What about a tree? He
had a tattoo of one with...

268
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,964
Looked like maple
leaves, only more jagged.

269
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:27,072
Oh!

270
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:28,731
You can just talk.

271
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:30,834
That's a blackwood tree.

272
00:13:31,344 --> 00:13:34,542
Okay, so, what if we locate the tree
from Seb's tattoo and chop it down?

273
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:37,683
Would that sever this
conduit? In theory, yes.

274
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:40,845
He would be mortal,
and 100% stab-able.

275
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:42,682
So, how do we find this tree?

276
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:45,691
Who has two thumbs and
aced their elective in dowsing?

277
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,319
Probably safer to
send two of us, though.

278
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,462
Just in case
something goes wrong.

279
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:54,228
Well, I'm a former tree goddess.

280
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:55,996
I'll go. No.

281
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:57,569
You can't go on a long hike

282
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,139
because you have the toe worms.

283
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:03,572
Oh, right. My toe worms.

284
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,577
I thought that was
just a wooden toe thing.

285
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:09,547
You thought wrong. There's a lot
of misinformation about toe worms.

286
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:12,118
I have them. Are you
gonna make me take a hike?

287
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:17,715
No. No worm-shame here.
Okay, uh, how about you, Margo?

288
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:20,524
(INHALES SHARPLY)
Could use your Centurion skills

289
00:14:20,593 --> 00:14:22,494
with all the Takers out there.

290
00:14:22,562 --> 00:14:25,162
If you do that, it'll just leave
me. And I kind of have a problem.

291
00:14:25,832 --> 00:14:28,267
After our last talk, Seb told
me to stay away from him.

292
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:32,066
So I don't really think I'm in a
position to, you know, stab him.

293
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:34,312
Yeah, but what if he needs you?

294
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:36,334
You're his Magician advisor.

295
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:39,675
Fen and I will come up with a
problem that takes two Magicians to fix,

296
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:41,908
assuming our toes can handle it.

297
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:45,079
It'll be touch and go.

298
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:48,348
Okay, but what if the
Dark King can feel it

299
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:51,255
when we chop down the tree,
and we have to act quickly?

300
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:54,521
I just don't know how quick
I can be, given everything.

301
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:57,462
Don't worry. We'll make it work.

302
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,891
The fuck, Margo? You promised.

303
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,597
And I meant it. You won't
be the one to kill Seb, exactly.

304
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:07,449
Why are you being so
weird and tricky about this?

305
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,066
I thought I was clear.

306
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,871
Wait.

307
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:13,912
Mmm.

308
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:18,117
That is the worst mojito
I've ever had in my entire life.

309
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:21,244
That's because, not
a mojito. It's a potion.

310
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,087
I was going to explain before you
got all grabby. But I guess here we go.

311
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,060
Oh.

312
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:33,223
Seb needs to die. You
can't do it, but I can.

313
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,928
So, get ready to...
Ovary up, bitch.

Give me my page back.

00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,531
Look, I will buy it from
you. Name your price.

321
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,332

BAX: Holy shit.

326
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:27,681
I just pushed him. It
shouldn't have done that.

327
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:36,523
What the hell was that?
We need to seal this room.

328
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:43,034
Jesus, Bambi. That was
kind of non-consensual.

329
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,831
You drank before
I could explain.

330
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:47,430
I've been trying to figure
out how to help you.

331
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:48,884
This is the only
way I could think of

332
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:51,309
to keep your hands
clean of Seb's murder.

333
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,903
Except they literally won't
be. Those are my hands.

334
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,457
Look, you're the one
who can get close.

335
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:57,541
I'm the one with
the will to stab.

337
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:02,812
El, I love you, but we
have to do this thing.

338
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,551
Even you agree with that.

339
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,757
This is the best compromise
I could come up with.

340
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,394
So, listen up. This
spell's got a little quirk

341
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:13,738
you should probably know about.

342
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,864
Tell anyone we've swapped and
we won't be able to swap back.

343
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:20,873
Permanently. That
is good to know.

344
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:28,145
Strange. It's like you're
Eliot. But not Eliot.

345
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,046
Oh, my God, you're
seeing Charlton.

346
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,947
What kind of a name is Charlton?

347
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,314
Family name. I never liked it.

348
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,014
He lives in my
head... Your head.

349
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:37,079
And why is there a
man living in your head?

350
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:40,023
Charlton and I were
Monster victims together.

351
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:43,688
He stayed in my head when
you pulled The Monster out.

352
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:45,254
I held on real tight.

353
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:48,630
So if he's in your head,
why didn't he swap with you?

354
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,966
I have no idea. Honestly,
this is all very new.

355
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,905
I'd have given you a
heads-up if I'd known your plan.

356
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:58,570
Listen, Charlie, stay
the fuck out of my way.

357
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:02,638
Hey, Bambi, before you go
all Bambi and scare him off,

358
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,809
why don't you maybe
let him help you?

359
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,752
I've managed just fine without a
Tyler Durden on my cooch. Thanks.

I'm just saying, this Seb
situation is pretty complicated.

361

You're not exactly a
subtle relationship person.

362
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:18,276
From what I've seen, he's right.

363
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,791
You've got to ride a really
fine line with the Dark King.

364
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:25,736
He lost his love,
but he likes me.

365
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:27,740
So, that feels like a betrayal.

366
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:30,003
That is a lot of drama to track.

367
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,135
What about you and Josh?

368
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:35,578
Since I'll be going on a long
walk to cut down a tree with him,

369
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:37,840
is there anything I should know?

370
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,182
Yeah. If Josh tries to pull
you into any kind of talk,

371
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,983

I was a little surprised to get
your message after our last convo.

The castle has been struck
with a strange sleeping curse.

378
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,612
Is that what happened to...

379
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:11,783
Wow.

380
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:14,182
We've kept it quiet.

a magical solution,

but I'm afraid it's beyond me.

383
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:25,128
I think I know this curse.
Good news, there's a cure.

384
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:28,793
Only prob, it takes a bit
of cooperative spell work.

385

You need four
hands to do it. I see.

well, if that's the truth,

407
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,942
then why haven't you
done something about it?

we lost you guys, and
it was a scary time, so...

do you want to break up?

a little more time to forgive myself.

Because I've realized that deciding
to leave you in the past was a mistake.

to earn your forgiveness,

you really have one?

511
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:06,090
I developed a potion
with a Dr. Maria Pilkin.

512
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:08,064
You can check with her,

513
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:12,429
but she died in this timeline.

514
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:17,699
No deal. We'll find our own way.

students without my help.

516
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,940
See, in our timeline,
Pilkin's work was published

517
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:26,746
after her death.
So, it's in our library.

to have strong instincts.

to go in together.

How is finishing the ritual early,
and in silence, part of your plan?

551
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,516
Because I taught
it to him wrong.

to get real close and personal.

Eliot, you're coming on too strong.

apology. Eliot, that's not necessary.

572
00:30:29,227 --> 00:30:32,686
It's just, I haven't felt this
way in a really long time.

I think the fact that we both...

It just felt safe with
you, you know?

we both felt it.

with wanting more.

more, but I just can't.

even if it means I suffer.

You're the expert.

00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:35,060
Okay, that's it.
I'm not buying it.

586
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,755
Not buying what? Any of this.

This is Fillory. I don't know.
You could be a hallucination,

590

or a shapeshifter, or an
agent of the Dark King.

Shit. I wish I could explain.

Oh, well, until you do, I'm not
taking you to the tree. Got it?

596
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,893
Yeah, and into Penny.

597
00:32:16,968 --> 00:32:19,028
It must be the fungus's
networking ability.

598
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:20,424
Long as it's alive
in other hosts,

599
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:22,634
it can still direct its spores
into whoever it wants.

600
00:32:22,741 --> 00:32:24,903
So why not into us?
We were right there.

601
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:27,969
Uh, Penny was closer? I
thought you were an expert.

602
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,516
I told you this isn't my area.
At this point, my best advice?

603
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,847
Give the fungus
what it wants. No.

604
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,822
Ever since I found this
page, I knew it was important.

605
00:32:37,923 --> 00:32:41,826
If the fungus wants it, I was
right. I have to know what it means.

606
00:32:41,927 --> 00:32:43,589
Is it worth dying over?

607
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:46,427
Is that what Quentin would
want? For you to die too?

608
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:48,228
Back the fuck up, botanist.

609
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:53,236
Sorry. Maybe I
overstepped. It's just...

610
00:32:55,707 --> 00:32:58,336
Remember that plant I put
on the window sill in the lab?

611
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:00,071
Yeah, you only
screamed at me about it.

612
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:02,080
Scottish Primrose.

613
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:04,616
It's this fragile little flower.
Even grass can kill it.

614
00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:08,085
So it has to survive on cliff
walls where nothing else can.

615
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:11,146
It was my wife
Isobel's favorite.

616
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,987

You named it after her?

617
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:19,655
You remembered the name.

00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:21,265
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

619
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:24,428
She loved that stupid flower.

620
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:26,165
Kept it alive without
any spell work.

621
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:31,369
Huge point of pride that I
thought was just kind of silly.

622
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:37,346
Then she died. So
now I keep it alive.

623
00:33:38,316 --> 00:33:39,978
If it's anything like that,

624
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:42,646
I get why you'd want
to keep that page.

625
00:33:45,924 --> 00:33:47,222
How long ago?

626
00:33:47,926 --> 00:33:52,489
Five years. You? A lot less.

627
00:33:53,999 --> 00:33:59,199
So, how long until, you know, it
feels less like it's eating all of you?

628
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:01,067
I'm kind of still waiting.

629
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:04,374

00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:08,704

It starts like this tight
ball in your chest,

633
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:15,020
but over time, it gets lighter

634
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:18,784
because it just kind of
spreads into the rest of you.

635
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,689
It's like your own
personal symbiote.

636
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,255
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, kind
of. Except not murderous

Make it to a year.

641
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:43,439
It'll still suck, but
it gets quieter.

642
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:44,572
I promise.

647
00:35:04,002 --> 00:35:07,268
I actually felt bad for him.
For what he's been through.

648
00:35:07,372 --> 00:35:10,103
He's a nice man,
but an evil king.

649
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:14,010
It doesn't make
sense. He seems kind.

650
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,240
He seems sad.

651
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:20,481
Why the fuck would he summon
those monsters into Fillory?

652
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:25,721
Eliot, I think we're
finished. It worked.

653
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:29,758
Before you go,
perhaps we should talk.

654
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:34,642
I don't know why
he summoned them,

655
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:37,500
but I don't think we're going
to get another chance at this.

656
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:52,846
Not as easy as it
looks, is it? Josh, please.

657
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:54,191
Eliot's waiting for the signal.

658
00:35:54,285 --> 00:35:55,429
If we don't chop down the tree,

659
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:58,446
he's screwed. We're screwed.
You said you wish you could explain.

660
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:00,992
That means there's something
to explain. So explain.

661
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:04,757
So you've been wanting to talk to me for
weeks about what happened between us.

662
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,593
But when I finally apologize,

663
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:08,890
you accuse me of
being possessed.

664
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,595
Right. Apologize. Does
that sound like Margo to you?

665
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:15,903
Fine! Maybe I was saying what you
wanted to hear 'cause you never let up.

666
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:18,419
You keep trying to get
me to talk about something

667
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:19,809
I don't want to talk about.

668
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:24,342
Okay, fine. I get that. You
want to know the truth?

669
00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:26,127
You picked someone
who will never put you first.

670
00:36:26,151 --> 00:36:28,677
There's no fixing
Margo. I mean, me.

671
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:32,349
Because chances are if I had to
relive it, I'd make the same decision.

672
00:36:32,457 --> 00:36:37,020
So, stop asking me to apologize
for something I don't feel sorry about.

673
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:41,025
Now you sound like you.

674
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:44,666
Not that I won't feel
differently tomorrow.

675
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:48,639
No. You won't.
You're very clear.

676
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,832
The conduit tree's
that one over there.

677
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:53,572
Cut it down. I'll give
Eliot the green light.

did you mean it?

Um...

685
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:20,596
Oh, right. Eliot asked Seb if
he'd consider giving up the throne.

686
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:22,765
He even offered to help
him, but Seb said no.

687

Eliot? Are you all right?

688
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:28,911
Yes, sorry. Of
course I meant it.

689
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:31,940
Because I've been thinking...

consequences if I do.

The World Seed. It's a

Legend is, the seed
is pure potential.

can grow into almost anything.

00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:20,955

that mean you already have the seed?

were limiting yourself.
