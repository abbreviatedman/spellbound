1
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,780
Previously on "The Magicians"...

2
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,336
I see blood on the walls.

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,290
I hear its voice.

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,100
It wants out.

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,236
Have you tried letting it out?

6
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,270
Charlton?

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,970
I once was possessed
by the Monster too.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,840
When all the scary creatures
were pulled out,

9
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,870
I held on tight as I could
in your happy place.

10
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,970
I found this
in Q's stuff at Brakebills.

11
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,140
Professor?

12
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,310
I mean... Dean Adiyodi?

13
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,810
Yeah, come in.

14
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,510
What did you do with Fogg 17?

15
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,580
I call that one Psycho Fogg.

16
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,766
- Put him in the clean room.
- He can't cast there, so.

17
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:36,750
I can't do what I need to do

18
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,090
if I'm worried about
how it's gonna affect you.

19
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,620
I think we need to be done.

20
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,036
I'm interviewing
for the botany job.

21
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,530
Hamish Bax.

22
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,860
If I'm right, this should
adjust circumstances

23
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,300
in the entire greenhouse,

24
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,930
allowing us to cast.

25
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,570
You risked everything for us.

26
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,500
The least we can do
is to show you the truth.

27
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:12,020
You can't outrun me!

28
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,210
- Six children taken.
- It's horrific.

29
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,110
- The Takers are swarming.
- It's my fault.

30
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,820
They're swarming because Seb
summoned them with a spell

31
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:40,650
using the gold I gave him.

32
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,520
I didn't know
what he was gonna do with it.

33
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:45,760
The Takers...
that's how he stays in power.

34
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,890
He summons them
and only he can fight them.

35
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,960
Jesus.

36
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,866
I go away to my nephew's
bar mitzvah for one weekend

37
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:52,330
and everything gets fercockt.

38
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,100
What are we going to do?

39
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:56,430
We gotta kill the Dark King.

40
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,230
What?
We're all thinking it.

41
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,300
Eli's Torah portion was
all about the sanctity of life,

42
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,170
and I found it very moving.

43
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,010
So, can't we, I don't know,
peacefully overthrow him?

44
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,680
No, we can't.

45
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:12,250
He's got a Centurion army.
I should know. I'm one of 'em.

46
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,050
Also 300 years of propaganda

47
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,326
convincing everyone
they need him.

48
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,350
Also-also, 300 years?

49
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,660
We're talking a powerful,
immortal magician?

50
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,930
Doubt you can just walk up
and stab the guy.

51
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,730
I've been researching.

52
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,676
The Dark King survived
seven assassination attempts

53
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,706
since he took our thrones.

54
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,970
Must be big magic
keeping him alive.

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,100
We have to figure out
what it is.

56
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:32,900
Find out his weakness.

57
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,046
You're on board with this too?

58
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,770
I mean, I'm here to stop
an apocalypse that happens

59
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,710
'cause an evil force invades
from a distant realm.

60
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,080
That sounds like the Takers.

61
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,410
Then it's settled.

62
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,480
We kill the Dark King,

63
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,620
stop the Takers from pouring
in, stop the apocalypse.

64
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,420
Who's in?

65
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,890
Just a couple of Q's, like

66
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,696
how are we gonna get
close enough to the Dark King

67
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,390
to learn his weakness
and assassinate him?

68
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,790
We're a cook, a maid,
a army grunt,

69
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,260
a Julia, and a...

70
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,260
Counselor/confidante.

71
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,300
You gotta admit, El,
you're perfectly placed.

72
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,300
Plus, he's always dismissing

73
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:05,700
his guards when you come around.

74
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,300
Why does me liking somebody
always end up with them dying?

75
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,210
You should
tell your friends, Eliot.

76
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,180
That I don't want
to save Fillory

77
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,880
because I caught feelings?

78
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:14,956
I'm saying
they should know how you feel

79
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,410
before they try to make you
do something you regret.

80
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,080
No, I'll just look selfish,
Charlton.

81
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,050
And I'll still end up having
to do it.

82
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,050
- Talking to somebody?
- Um...

83
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,920
myself and psyching myself up.

84
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,136
Fillory needs the Dark King dead

85
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,290
and I am the obvious inside man.

86
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,030
- You sound weird.
- You sound weird.

87
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,000
Okay.

88
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,570
It's that Eliot.

89
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,470
Uh, look,
I know I'm just the guy

90
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,146
who has to live inside your
tragic remembrances and all

91
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,500
but I truly don't understand

92
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,540
why you won't at least tell her.

93
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,810
Margo.

94
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,710
Look...

95
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,410
I'm not sure I can
go through with this.

96
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,780
El, you have a crush
on a boy who's bad for you.

97
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:51,710
Happens to all of us,

98
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,350
but how do we get crushes
out of our system?

99
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,450
Lots of drinking, pining,

100
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:57,820
some detailed sex fantasies.

101
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:58,720
No.

102
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,290
We bang them out.

103
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,130
Okay, that's great,

104
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,736
except for the part where now
I have to murder the guy

105
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,630
I just hypothetically
slept with,

106
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,106
which is a thing
that shouldn't really happen

107
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,400
to a person more than once.

108
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,570
El,

109
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,000
Fillory does need this,

110
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:14,170
so if you can't do it,
tell me now.

111
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:19,040
I know he has to die,
but I don't hate him.

112
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,340
I don't.
I can't.

113
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:23,210
I can't make
betraying Seb easier,

114
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,080
but let me help make it simpler.

115
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,380
Say you didn't have
to kill him yourself.

116
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,120
- But I'm the one with access.
- You just said it.

117
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,860
You're also my best friend.

118
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:33,966
If you can find his weakness,

119
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,036
I'll find a way you don't have
to be the one to do it,

120
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,130
I promise.

121
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,960
How?

122
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,530
I have no fucking idea,

123
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,700
but I'll figure it out
for you, okay?

124
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,540
Okay.

125
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,850
You took the thing, the panel.

126
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,320
You can't just...

127
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,090
this is mass floricide.

128
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,720
Sorry, I had
to bring the panel here

129
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,990
so I could study it.

130
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:10,360
Sorry, I can't hear you
over my plants dying.

131
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,500
Is this a western-facing window?

132
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,060
And how we have
a working classroom

133
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,230
because, you know, school
for magicians, not flowers.

134
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,900
Took the botany job 'cause
you fixed up the greenhouse.

135
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,010
Should've known you'd just
turn around and wreck it.

136
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,670
Here, let me explain
how that feels.

137
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,140
Hey!

138
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,880
Wait, don't touch that.

139
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:30,680
Huh.

140
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,080
Thick venation
through the leaves,

141
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,880
and look at the asymmetry here.

142
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,420
Wait, do you recognize it?

143
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,520
Don't think it's terrestrial.

144
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,890
You'd need
a classification expert

145
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,860
with the right magical tools.

146
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,660
I know a taxonomist
that's been around,

147
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,600
you know, the multiverse.

148
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:47,900
Well, do you think
we can get him to come here?

149
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,630
Don't see why not.

150
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,600
I'll tell you why not.

151
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:54,400
Your pal Raylan is on
the dean's "Do Not Admit" list.

152
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,846
- You're Acting Dean.
- Can't you just...

153
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,140
Alice.

154
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,510
He's a botanist.

155
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,440
Yes!

156
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,510
Who visited a world
called Anansia,

157
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,350
home to some
highly infectious shit.

158
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,280
He's still alive, isn't he?

159
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,250
Magical phytologists
do crazy shit,

160
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,050
but Ray's smart.

161
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,560
I doubt he's carrying
anything... well, dangerous.

162
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,590
No offense,

163
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,520
but I'm gonna trust the file
with the red stamp.

164
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,106
Look, the only place
on Earth right now

165
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,130
with magic stable enough
for Ray to examine it

166
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,130
is in our lab, thanks to me

167
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,230
installing the Circumstances
Control Panel for you.

168
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,770
Don't you think figuring out
the deal with magic

169
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,740
is more important than
translating some page

170
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,640
you found about a plant?

171
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:32,310
I found it in Quentin's desk.

172
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,750
This thing, it makes no sense

173
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,580
except it was important to Q,

174
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,520
so maybe it's important
we figure out what it is.

175
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,860
If we test him thoroughly

176
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,330
and he's clean,

177
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,830
he can come.

178
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:06,380
- Uh... hey, Fen.
- Yeah?

179
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,486
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

180
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:12,180
Um, lately I've just been
feeling a little bit off.

181
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:15,080
If we were on Earth,
I'd know what to do, but...

182
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,320
is there, like, a magic plant
or something out here

183
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,260
that I can pee on
to find out if I'm...

184
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,090
Pregnant!

185
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,660
Shit.

186
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,530
Sorry.

187
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,876
God, I don't know
why I'm crying, just...

188
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,930
babies, ahh!

189
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,000
Um, do you know
what you're gonna do?

190
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:34,800
Um, I'm not so sure.

191
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,840
Do you want me
to send a bunny to Penny?

192
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:40,610
Uh, Penny and I are just...

193
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,040
we're sort of in a weird place.

194
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,550
Oh.

195
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,950
Actually, until I've had
some time to process,

196
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,596
I'd really appreciate
if we could keep this

197
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,720
between you and I, please?

198
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,296
- Of course.
- I'm really good with secrets.

199
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,720
I've kept Eliot's fear of
butterflies secret for years.

200
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,420
Until now, shit!

201
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,606
Sorry, I won't do that with you.

202
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,090
Pregnant.

203
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,670
Made macarons.

204
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,270
Mango yuzu and matcha.
Anyone?

205
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,100
Why?

206
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,570
- For sustenance?
- You love them.

207
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:11,670
Nice try, Hoberman.

208
00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:14,010
We're on mission,
so no distractions.

209
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,040
Out.

210
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,550
Sorry for interrupting.

211
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,280
Can you believe that guy?

212
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,850
- What are you talking about?
- You eat matcha everything.

213
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,120
Those macarons were a trap.

214
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,660
Josh is an emotional ninja.

215
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,230
He comes at you with sweets,
and then you just

216
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,360
confess things.

217
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:35,260
So you're still avoiding
that conversation you owe him

218
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:37,470
about leaving him in the past.

219
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,300
That is not gonna
be a good talk,

220
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,600
so we're not gonna have it.

221
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,776
We have real things
to worry about,

222
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,686
like how you're gonna find out
the Dark King's secret.

223
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:46,410
And we can't
enjoy mango yuzu macarons

224
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,510
while we worry about that?

225
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:50,450
Never take the food, Eliot.

226
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,150
Which gives me an idea.

227
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:58,750
Seb, I brought you something.

228
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,660
Oh, my God.

229
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:08,000
Are you okay?

230
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:10,300
Six children.

231
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:13,970
Six children taken.

232
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,540
It's my fault.

233
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:18,470
If I'd have been there,
I could've stopped them.

234
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:21,980
Being a king...

235
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,150
nobody knows
what it's really like.

236
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,920
Seb...

237
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,620
do you think you could ever
step down?

238
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,660
I have to be king.

239
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,730
You don't have to be anything.

240
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,000
I could help you.

241
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,510
Eliot, I appreciate your concern

242
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,680
more than I can say.

243
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,610
This is my burden.

244
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,080
I can't leave.

245
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:59,320
Is it something we can fix?

246
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,550
A spell or a curse of some kind.

247
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,620
A choice

248
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:07,320
I made a long time ago,

249
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,190
tied to a conduit.

250
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,360
I thought it was the only way
I could save Fillory.

251
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,960
- A conduit?
- What do you mean?

252
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,930
It was a lifetime ago.

253
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,540
So many lifetimes ago.

254
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,210
We could just get out of here.

255
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,010
We could
just go camping or, um...

256
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,040
I'm sorry.

257
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,350
I forgot myself.

258
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,520
Look, Seb,
we can make this okay.

259
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,480
Perhaps we shouldn't
see each other again.

260
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,370
Sorry, Ray.

261
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,940
I gotta test you
for spine-burrowing spiders.

262
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:34,910
You know the drill.
Chew, don't swallow.

263
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:42,320
Your Primula scotica isobelae
is flourishing, Baxie.

264
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,750
Spit.

265
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,890
Everyone's panties untwisted?

266
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,790
Because it turned purple?

267
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:52,260
Purple is good,

268
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:54,630
uncontrollably shitting spiders
is bad.

269
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,270
Ray, what do you make of...

270
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,500
All right, Glasses.

271
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:01,070
I'm going to say a word
that you don't know.

272
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,140
Phyllotaxis.

273
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:04,570
The arrangement of leaves
around a central stalk.

274
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,310
Oh, you're one of those?

275
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,210
Says the arrogant,
dime-a-dozen academic

276
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,780
with a plant fetish.

277
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,356
But later when you recount
how you told me off,

278
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,120
I'm sure you'll punch it up
to be more of a dick chop.

279
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,450
Looks chaotic, but it's not.

280
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,990
If follows
a mathematical sequence.

281
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:17,990
The leaves of this plant

282
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,090
suggest that its origin
is exceptionally exotic.

283
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,436
Or it is just a made-up drawing.

284
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,560
To an amateur,

285
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,830
I could see that being
the easiest explanation, yes,

286
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,600
but no.
No, this has something.

287
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,060
Plants, they have a certain
integrity to them, hmm?

288
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,070
It's hard to fake that.

289
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,830
Do you think
you can identify it?

290
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,400
- Only guy who can.
- Mm, joy.

291
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,640
Would you be a sweetie

292
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:38,870
and get me a spectral-reactive
phytometer, a Bertric lens,

293
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,010
and a pamplemousse LaCroix?

294
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,240
Happy to.

295
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,650
- No.
- If I stay, I might kill him.

296
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:57,530
The Dark King's immortal
because of a conduit?

297
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,500
Like, a vitality conduit?

298
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,600
Do we know what that is?

299
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:04,230
Guess not.

300
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,700
It's an old naturalist ritual.

301
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,140
Draw life force from a stalk
of corn to fight a summer cold,

302
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,010
that sort of thing.

303
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,980
Seb's immortality
comes from corn?

304
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,710
What about a tree?

305
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,810
He had a tattoo of one

306
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,650
with what looked like
maple leaves, only more jagged.

307
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,780
Oh!

308
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,880
You can just talk.

309
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,120
Uh, that's a Blackwood tree.

310
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,890
Okay, so what if we locate

311
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,860
the tree from Seb's
tattoo and chop it down?

312
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:28,320
Would that sever this conduit?

313
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,330
In theory, yes.

314
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,700
He would be mortal
and 100% stab-able.

315
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,906
So how do we find this tree?

316
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:37,800
Who has two thumbs and aced
their elective in dousing?

317
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:42,400
Probably safer
to send two of us, though.

318
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,340
Just in case something
goes wrong.

319
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:46,610
Well, I'm
a former tree goddess, I'll go.

320
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,110
No!

321
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,180
You can't go on a long hike
because you have the...

322
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:52,510
toe worms.

323
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:55,420
Oh right, my toe worms.

324
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,420
I thought that was just
a wooden toe thing.

325
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,450
You thought wrong.

326
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:01,320
There's a lot of misinformation
about toe worms.

327
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,860
I have them.
You gonna make me take a hike?

328
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:06,760
- No.
- No worm shame here.

329
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,630
Okay. How about you, Margo?

330
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,000
Could use your Centurion skills

331
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,840
with all the Takers out there.

332
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:15,116
If you do that,
it'll just leave me,

333
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,940
and I kind of have a problem.

334
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:19,680
After our last talk, Seb
told me to stay away from him,

335
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,740
so I don't really think

336
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,440
I'm in a position to, you know,

337
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,880
stab him.

338
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:25,880
Yeah, but what if he needs you?

339
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,480
You're his Magician advisor.

340
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,480
Fen and I will come up
with a problem

341
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,690
that takes two Magicians
to fix...

342
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,120
assuming our toes can handle it.

343
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,230
It'll be touch-and-go.

344
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:39,290
Okay, but what if
the Dark King can feel it

345
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:42,230
when we chop down the tree
and we have to act quickly?

346
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:45,370
I just don't know how quick
I can be, given everything.

347
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,440
- Don't worry.
- We'll make it work.

348
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,440
- The fuck, Margo?
- You promised.

349
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,880
And I meant it.

350
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,110
You won't be the one
to kill Seb, exactly.

351
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,026
Why are you being so weird
and tricky about this?

352
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,180
I thought I was clear.

353
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:01,250
Thank you.

354
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,320
Wait.

355
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,220
That is the worst mojito I have
ever had in my entire life.

356
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,160
That's because not a mojito.

357
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,130
It's a potion.

358
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,630
I was gonna explain
before you got all grabby,

359
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,460
but I guess here we go.

360
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,600
Ugh.

361
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,440
Seb needs to die.
You can't do it, but I can.

362
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:24,640
So get ready to...

363
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:27,110
Ovary up, bitch.

364
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,250
Margo, did we just
"Freaky Friday?"

365
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:46,930
Bax!

366
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:51,900
What did you do to him?

367
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:54,240
He's fine, he's fine.

368
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:56,070
Give me my page back.

369
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,510
Look...

370
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,970
I will buy it from you.

371
00:15:59,010 --> 00:15:59,940
Name your price.

372
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,780
Put it down now.

373
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,520
Holy shit.

374
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,330
- I just pushed him.
- It shouldn't have done that.

375
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,500
What the hell was that?

376
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,500
We need to seal this room.

377
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,360
- Jesus, Bambi.
- That was kind of nonconsensual.

378
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,116
You drank
before I could explain.

379
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,910
I have been trying
to figure out to help you.

380
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,410
This is the only way
I could think of

381
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,850
to keep your hands clean
of Seb's murder.

382
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,096
Except they literally won't be.

383
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,120
Those are my hands.

384
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,920
Look, you're the one
who can get close,

385
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,690
I'm the one
with the will to stab.

386
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:52,130
El, I love you,
but we have to do this thing.

387
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,960
Even you agree with that.

388
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:59,470
This is the best compromise
I could come up with.

389
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,040
So listen up... this spell's got

390
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:03,610
a little quirk
you should probably know about.

391
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,840
Tell anyone we've swapped and
we won't be able to swap back...

392
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,340
permanently.

393
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,880
That is good to know.

394
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,650
Strange.

395
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,090
It's like you're Eliot
but not Eliot.

396
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,290
Oh my God,
you're seeing Charlton.

397
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,596
What kind of a name is Charlton?

398
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,160
- Family name.
- I never liked it.

399
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,660
He lives in my head...
your head.

400
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,630
And why is there a man living
in your head?

401
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,900
Charlton and I
were Monster victims together.

402
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:32,230
He stayed in my head when
you pulled the Monster out.

403
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,840
I held on real tight.

404
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:37,240
So if he's in your head,
why didn't he swap with you?

405
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,770
I have no idea.

406
00:17:38,810 --> 00:17:40,340
Honestly, this is all very new.

407
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:43,210
I'd have given you a heads-up
if I'd known your plan.

408
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,010
Listen.

409
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:46,880
Charlie,
stay the fuck out of my way.

410
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,820
Hey, Bambi?

411
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:48,880
Before you go all...

412
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,850
Bambi, and scare him off,

413
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,590
why don't you maybe
let him help you?

414
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,590
I've managed just fine

415
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,030
without a Tyler Durden
up my cooch, thanks.

416
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:57,890
I'm just saying

417
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:00,500
this Seb situation
is pretty complicated.

418
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:02,900
You're not exactly a...

419
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,770
subtle relationship person.

420
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,670
From what I've seen, he's right.

421
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,610
He's gotta ride a really
fine line with the Dark King.

422
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,780
He lost his love,
but he likes me,

423
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,440
so that feels like a betrayal.

424
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,650
That is a lot of drama to track.

425
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,680
What about you and Josh?

426
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,250
Since I'll be going
on a long walk

427
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,520
to cut down a tree with him,

428
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,050
is there anything I should know?

429
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,120
Yeah.

430
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,720
If Josh tries to pull you
into any kind of talk,

431
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,790
just don't.

432
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,070
I was a little surprised
to get your message

433
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,740
after our last convo.

434
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,580
I know things got complicated.

435
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,780
The circumstances have changed.

436
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:54,980
Castle has been struck
with a strange sleeping curse.

437
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,550
Is that what happened to...

438
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,620
wow.

439
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,890
We've kept it quiet.

440
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,430
Obviously,
it requires a magical solution,

441
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,360
but I'm afraid it's beyond me.

442
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,200
I think I know this curse.

443
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,270
Good news, there's a cure.

444
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:15,240
Only prob: It takes a bit
of cooperative spellwork.

445
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:17,370
You need four hands to do it.

446
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,170
- I see.
- So you wanna solve this,

447
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:20,740
we're gonna have
to work together,

448
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,350
even if it makes uncomf
or whatevs.

449
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,150
You sound strange.

450
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,350
I haven't been feeling myself.

451
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,050
Since our last talk.

452
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:33,290
Yes.

453
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:37,830
Let us work together
to solve this curious malady,

454
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,660
for the good of Fillory.

455
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,760
That could've gone smoother.

456
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,610
Sleeping pollen
worked like a charm.

457
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,650
Or a curse, I guess.

458
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,220
Oh, Umber's balls.

459
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,350
Margo just keeps leaving
her uniform lying around.

460
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:08,660
Makes me feel like a maid.

461
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,790
Right.

462
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:13,900
Julia, let me take over.
Rest is good for the baby.

463
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:16,830
- Not a baby.
- Still baking.

464
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,830
But it'll become a baby.

465
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:21,670
You do know
how this works, right?

466
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,670
Look, Fen,

467
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,370
I just want to live my life

468
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:27,740
without this defining
every aspect of it, you get me?

469
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,680
Okay, well, if that's the truth

470
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:31,010
then why haven't you
done something about it?

471
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,820
It's not a hard procedure,
not even in Fillory.

472
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,120
You think I should abort it?

473
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:38,820
I'm saying
you should make a choice.

474
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,890
You're letting something
into your life

475
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,660
that you can't control and in
lots of ways will control you.

476
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:47,400
It'll make you happy,

477
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,200
or devastate you.

478
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,200
Yeah.

479
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,240
Look, I've been pregnant before,

480
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:58,440
and it was really bad.

481
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:01,010
And I knew this time
if I told everyone about it,

482
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,280
they'd get worried
and overprotective

483
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:06,250
and I just wanted to take one
of the next nine months

484
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,820
to feel like maybe this time

485
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,450
it wouldn't be so terrible,
you know?

486
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:14,590
- Nine months?
- What are you talking about?

487
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,120
It's Red Monkey Month.

488
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,060
Red Monkey what?

489
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:19,760
Everything goes faster
in Red Monkey Month.

490
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,230
Healing, crop growth,

491
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,500
weirdly, not monkeys.

492
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,330
I'm sorry, are you saying that

493
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,900
my pregnancy
is going to be sped up?

494
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,640
Julia, it already is.

495
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:30,010
As long as you stay in Fillory.

496
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,340
Oh, Jesus Christ.

497
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:41,620
Get the fuck away from me.

498
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:42,720
What's wrong?

499
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,490
I thought I saw a butterfly.

500
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,290
You never know
where they're gonna go next.

501
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,760
- Lavender rose macaron?
- I know they're your favorite.

502
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,760
I'd better not.

503
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:54,960
Margo, it's a snack, not a trap.

504
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,440
You're a really good baker.

505
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:06,310
Also taller from this POV.

506
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,780
I learned to dial in that recipe

507
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,340
while I was stuck in the past.

508
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,050
Fen had her knives,

509
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,210
I had baking.

510
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,110
Oh, yeah.

511
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,780
That must've been tough
for you both.

512
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,680
It was.

513
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,020
I mean... sorry,
I didn't mean to bring it up.

514
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:19,550
We don't have to talk about it.

515
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,936
- Okay.
- How much further, you think?

516
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,720
It's just
we thought we lost you guys,

517
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,760
and it was a scary time, so...

518
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,860
So we must be
getting near Seb's tree, huh?

519
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,330
Are we really not gonna do this?

520
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,870
Look, I'd be lying
if I said it didn't hurt

521
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,640
when you wanted
to abandon me in the past,

522
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:36,300
but I know it wasn't about me.

523
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,210
Still, Margo, I have to ask.

524
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,540
Do you wanna break up?

525
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:42,410
I mean, are we even
a thing that can be broken up?

526
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,080
I...

527
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:46,350
what do you think?

528
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,956
Sometimes I feel like
that's what you want.

529
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:51,190
Look, when we got together,
I said I wasn't into games,

530
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,120
and do you remember
what you said?

531
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,490
Oh.

532
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,390
You said, "Fuck games."

533
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,060
That does sound like me.

534
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:00,330
I can accept it's over
if you just say the words.

535
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,300
Josh, I wanna talk.

536
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,830
I really do, but I can't.

537
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,940
Except to say

538
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,670
that maybe I need
a little more time

539
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,870
to forgive myself.

540
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,180
- Oh.
- Uh, really?

541
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,550
Yes!

542
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,710
Because I've realized

543
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,980
that deciding to leave you
in the past was a mistake...

544
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,420
a big one.

545
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:25,020
And now I need
to earn your forgiveness,

546
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,490
which may take a while,

547
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,620
so we can kind of
keep things status quo

548
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:30,760
in the meantime.

549
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,330
I...

550
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,200
sure, sure.

551
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:34,930
Great.

552
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,600
Now, which way to the tree?

553
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:37,630
Uh...

554
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:47,880
I think Ray
was hosting a symbiote.

555
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:50,080
- He was possessed?
- Not possessed.

556
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,350
It's rare, but a few
fungus species have been known

557
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,320
to join consciousness
with other creatures.

558
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:57,350
You're still you, you just
share brainpower, thoughts.

559
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,050
And then you explode.

560
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,096
Well, I'm not a mushroom guy,

561
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,790
but I think that's because

562
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,630
Ray merged with the fungus
a long, long time ago.

563
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,860
Is he... shit, are they dead?

564
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,060
Ray is,

565
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:11,030
but those particles that came
out of him were fungal spores.

566
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:13,100
They'll want a new host body.

567
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:14,600
I sealed them inside the lab,

568
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,710
but it might be a good idea
to close the air vents.

569
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,810
- Yeah, hi.
- New to this job.

570
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,580
I have no idea how
to control the school vents.

571
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:22,740
We need to evacuate.

572
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,650
Knew I should've trusted
my instincts.

573
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:32,120
Hey, hey!
There's a, um...

574
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:33,020
Eukaryotic photosymbiont.

575
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:35,020
Yeah, there's a monster
on the loose.

576
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:38,560
Head to the Physical Kids'
Cottage to be quarantined now.

577
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,770
Alice, give us the plant page...

578
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,840
Then we'll stop spreading.

579
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,810
- Oh, oh.
- Okay!

580
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,780
New theory: The fungus can
spread to multiple hosts.

581
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,156
This might be a zombie plague
situation.

582
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,650
- What?
- What?

583
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:09,050
I say this is the man
who blew up my Brakebills.

584
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:12,090
You're the worst goddamn dean
we've ever had.

585
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:15,700
Yeah, I'm not here
for a lecture from my prisoner.

586
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:16,830
Just hiding from spores.

587
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,030
Oh, so you remember

588
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:20,500
that this room
is hermetically sealed,

589
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,670
but not to consult
the "Do Not Admit" list?

590
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,740
I did everything a dean
is supposed to do.

591
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:27,680
A dean is supposed
to have strong instincts,

592
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,710
like knowing anyone
who'd visit Anansia

593
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,510
is also insane enough
to visit other worlds

594
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:35,150
with infections
for which we cannot test.

595
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,250
- DO you want to help or what?
- Yes.

596
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:39,620
I can provide a solution...

597
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:41,290
in exchange for my release.

598
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,960
How do we know
you really have one?

599
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:46,230
I developed a potion
with a Dr. Maria Pilkin.

600
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:49,030
You can check with her.

601
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,500
But...

602
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:53,940
she died in this timeline.

603
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,070
No deal.

604
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,710
We'll find our own way.

605
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,940
You cannot save your students
without my help.

606
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:02,180
See, in our timeline

607
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:04,980
Pilkin's work was published
after her death,

608
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,980
so it's in our library.

609
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:11,490
Gave away your leverage.

610
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,820
Thought a dean was supposed
to have strong instincts.

611
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,460
I will get out of here,

612
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:20,500
and then I'll turn you
into lobsters

613
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:21,860
and eat you.

614
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,400
Uh, okay.

615
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,350
Okay, the book we need
is right there.

616
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,210
See any twitching?

617
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,980
Just assume
they're all infected.

618
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:41,950
And assume
they're all looking for us.

619
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,396
It's too risky for us
to go in together.

620
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,520
- I know where it is.
- I'll go.

621
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,590
Hey.

622
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,920
Remember, magic is
unpredictable outside the lab.

623
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,030
So no phosphoromancy.

624
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,166
Good thing I have experience

625
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:54,500
being invisible
from high school.

626
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:00,800
Ooh, ooh.

627
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:04,830
You got us the book
and a guinea pig.

628
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,300
Nice work.

629
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:08,970
It said the potion
should work fast.

630
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,820
Penny.

631
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:23,250
Oh, shit.

632
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,550
Penny.

633
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,360
Just give up the page, Alice.

634
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,340
Almost ready.

635
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:42,470
Great.

636
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,940
Uh...

637
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:46,110
Margo, you have
to draw this out.

638
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,556
The second they wake,
Seb will dismiss you.

639
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,110
No shit, Sherlock.

640
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,980
This is all part of my plan
to win him over.

641
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:52,350
How is finishing the ritual

642
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,180
early and in silence
part of your plan?

643
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,350
Because I taught it
to him wrong,

644
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:59,050
so to fix it, I'm gonna have
to get real close and personal.

645
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,890
Eliot?

646
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,796
Something in the middle section
doesn't feeling right.

647
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,266
The energies aren't moving
as they should.

648
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:05,830
Hmm.

649
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,260
I can walk you through it.

650
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,970
Wait.

651
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,770
That's not right.

652
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,840
Here.

653
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:29,420
We should keep our distance.

654
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:31,620
It will make things easier.

655
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:33,220
Right.

656
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,460
Of course.

657
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,390
If you need my help, just ask.

658
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,330
Jesus' clits.

659
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,400
I know how to work a guy,
Charlton.

660
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:43,500
- Yes.
- You do, Margo.

661
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:45,300
As Eliot, you're coming on
too strong.

662
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:47,300
Seb likes Eliot's vulnerability.

663
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:50,000
Don't be pushy, just open up.

664
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,840
He and Eliot are close because
of the losses they share.

665
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:00,280
I can show you the rest
if you're ready.

666
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,280
But first,
I think I owe you an apology.

667
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,890
- Eliot, that's not necessary.
- It's just...

668
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,160
I haven't felt this way
in a really long time.

669
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:12,630
I think the fact that we both...

670
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:15,100
it just felt safe with you,
you know?

671
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:20,270
On that mountain
we both felt it.

672
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,900
There's nothing wrong
with wanting more.

673
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:26,670
I wish I could give you more,
but I just can't.

674
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:30,410
I must put Fillory first,
even if it means I suffer.

675
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,280
I do hope you understand that.

676
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,550
I get it.

677
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,750
It's hard to be king.

678
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:40,720
People don't know
what you go through.

679
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,560
Now let me show you how
to do that spell correctly.

680
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,710
Are we close to the tree?

681
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:06,650
I don't mean to rush.
You're the expert.

682
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,580
Okay, that's it.

683
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,320
I'm not buying it.

684
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:12,150
- Not buying what?
- Any of this.

685
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:14,690
Emotional, agreeable, patient?

686
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,690
You're not Margo.

687
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,920
Who else would I be?

688
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,960
- This is Fillory.
- I don't know.

689
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:22,860
You could be a hallucination,
or... or a shapeshifter,

690
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,830
or an agent of the Dark King.

691
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:27,800
- But I'm not.
- Josh, I'm...

692
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,600
shit.

693
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,770
I wish I could explain.

694
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:34,740
Oh, well, until you do,
I'm not taking you to the tree.

695
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,550
Got it?

696
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,566
The antifungal kind of worked.

697
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,920
We got the spores out of him.

698
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,190
Yeah, and into Penny.

699
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:53,760
It must be the fungus'
networking ability.

700
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,836
Long as it's alive
in other hosts,

701
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,170
it can still direct its spores
into whoever it wants.

702
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,300
- So why not into us?
- We were right there.

703
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:01,270
Penny was closer?

704
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,600
I thought you were an expert.

705
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,816
I told you this isn't my area.

706
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,610
At this point, my best advice?
Give the fungus what it wants.

707
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,210
No.

708
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,110
Ever since I found this page
I knew it was important.

709
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:14,680
If the fungus wants it,
I was right.

710
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,050
I have to know what it means.

711
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,790
Is it worth dying over?

712
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,926
Is that what Quentin would want?

713
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:20,690
For you to die, too?

714
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,520
Back the fuck off, botanist.

715
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,390
- Sorry.
- Maybe I overstepped.

716
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:27,500
It's just...

717
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:32,430
Remember that plant I put
on the windowsill in the lab?

718
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:34,300
Yeah, you only screamed
at me about it.

719
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,940
Scottish primrose.

720
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:37,116
It's this fragile little flower.

721
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,310
Even grass can kill it,

722
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:43,080
so it has to survive on cliff
walls where nothing else can.

723
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:45,980
It was my wife Isobel's
favorite.

724
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:51,690
- Primula scotica isobelae.
- You named it after her?

725
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,490
You remembered the name.

726
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,960
She loved that stupid flower.

727
00:32:57,990 --> 00:32:59,830
Kept it alive
without any spellwork.

728
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:02,060
Huge point of pride.

729
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,230
But I thought it was just
kind of silly.

730
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:11,170
Then she died,
so now I keep it alive.

731
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:13,240
If it's anything like that,

732
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:16,040
I get why you'd
wanna keep that page.

733
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,180
How long ago?

734
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:24,050
- Five years.
- You?

735
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:26,520
A lot less.

736
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:30,020
So how long until, you know,
it feels

737
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,430
less like it's eating
all of you?

738
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,930
I'm kind of still waiting.

739
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,570
I just feel like I'm gonna be

740
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,930
this walking whatever-I-am
forever.

741
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:42,370
I did too.

742
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,410
It starts like
this tight ball in your chest,

743
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,740
but over time, it gets lighter

744
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:52,510
because it just kind of spreads
into the rest of you.

745
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:54,480
It's like your own personal
symbiote.

746
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,390
Yeah, kind of.

747
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:01,460
Except not murderous
and weirdly paper-focused.

748
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:03,990
Just, uh...

749
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,960
sad.

750
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:06,990
Yeah.

751
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:11,370
Make it to a year.

752
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,700
It'll still suck,
but it gets quieter.

753
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,770
I promise.

754
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,650
Shit.

755
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,080
I know what to do.

756
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,960
Damn.

757
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:39,460
I actually felt bad for him,
for what he's been through.

758
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:42,100
He's a nice man,
but an evil king.

759
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:43,830
It doesn't make sense.

760
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,930
He seems kind.

761
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:49,270
He seems sad.

762
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:52,910
Why the fuck would he summon
those monsters into Fillory?

763
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,740
Eliot.

764
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:58,780
I think we're finished.
It worked.

765
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:01,520
Before you go,
perhaps we should talk?

766
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:05,996
I don't know
why he summoned them,

767
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:08,260
but I don't think we're gonna
get another chance at this.

768
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:21,870
Not as easy as it looks, is it?

769
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,170
Josh, please.

770
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:25,346
Eliot's waiting for the signal.

771
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,016
If we don't chop down the tree,
he's screwed.

772
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:27,910
We're screwed!

773
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,810
You said
you wish you could explain.

774
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,680
That means there's something
to explain, so explain.

775
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,496
So you've been wanting
to talk to me for weeks

776
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,850
about what happened between us,
but when I finally apologize

777
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:39,990
you accuse me
of being possessed.

778
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,390
Right, apologize.

779
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,696
Does that sound like Margo
to you?

780
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,090
Fine!

781
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:45,830
Maybe I was saying
what you wanted to hear,

782
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:47,900
'cause you never let up.

783
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:49,336
You keep trying to get me
to talk about something

784
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,400
I don't wanna talk about.

785
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:53,700
- Okay.
- Fine, I get that.

786
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:54,700
You wanna know the truth?

787
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,900
You picked someone
who will never put your first.

788
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,540
There's no fixing Margo...
I mean me,

789
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:01,540
'cause chances are
if I had to relive it,

790
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,240
I'd make the same decision.

791
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,610
So stop asking me
to apologize for something

792
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:07,750
I don't feel sorry about.

793
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,920
Now you sound like you.

794
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:15,260
Not that I won't
feel differently tomorrow.

795
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:19,330
- No, you won't.
- You're very clear.

796
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,330
The Conduit Tree's
that one over there.

797
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,360
Cut it down.

798
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,130
I'll give Eliot the green light.

799
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,200
Oh, God.

800
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:29,000
I'm fine here.

801
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,070
Go help the others
search the castle

802
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:33,770
for any remaining victims
of the sleeping curse.

803
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:42,820
What you said last night...

804
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:44,320
did you mean it?

805
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:46,490
Um...

806
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,720
Oh, right.

807
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,660
Uh, Eliot asked Seb if he'd
consider giving up the throne.

808
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,730
He even offered to help him,
but Seb said no.

809
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,930
Eliot, are you all right?

810
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,570
Yes, sorry.

811
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:58,970
Of course I meant it.

812
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,370
Because I've been thinking.

813
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,876
- Margo, the candles.
- That's the signal.

814
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,810
They cut down Seb's tree.

815
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,210
- Eliot?
- It's now or never.

816
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,050
Eliot should be done by now.

817
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:23,390
- Well, they're in a hurry.
- Gods, we're in trouble.

818
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,630
Here, take my extra knife.

819
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,390
All the knives in the world

820
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:27,230
won't get us past
the Centurions.

821
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,430
Do you have a better plan?

822
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,000
- Are you under a hex?
- A witch's spell?

823
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,270
What's going on?

824
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,100
I can explain.

825
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:38,210
Just... there will be
serious consequences if I do.

826
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,340
No, you can't tell him.

827
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:40,486
Margo, you'll be stuck in there.

828
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,586
There will be
serious consequences

829
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:42,980
if you don't explain.

830
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,010
You asked and I'm here.

831
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,580
So...

832
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:21,420
you gonna give up the page
or make us spore you, too?

833
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:26,920
I'll give it to you.

834
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,690
If you tell me why you want it.

835
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:34,160
- It's an instruction manual.
- For what?

836
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,160
The World Seed.

837
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,930
It's magical botanical organism.

838
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:40,570
Legend is, the seed
is pure potential.

839
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,370
The right nurturing, it can
grow into almost everything...

840
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:46,740
even an entire world.

841
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:47,610
Well, if you want the page,

842
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,710
does that mean
you already have the seed?

843
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,650
We're done talking.

844
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,360
Alice?

845
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:05,990
What are you doing to us?

846
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,630
Me?

847
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,930
I'm just keeping you talking.

848
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,200
All that shared brainpower

849
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:13,270
and you never thought
to yourselves,

850
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,000
where's Bax?

851
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,770
I mean, you had us stumped
for a while.

852
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:20,070
It seemed like
if we got you out of one host

853
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,956
you'd just keep spreading
yourself to other ones,

854
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,340
but you didn't.

855
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:26,310
For some reason,
you were limiting yourself.

856
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:28,880
Some of your spores
didn't try to spread.

857
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,420
Bax wasn't sure why

858
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:34,490
because fungi
can typically grow and grow.

859
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,760
But you're also
a consciousness, like us.

860
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:42,160
And we have limits.

861
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,900
Try to juggle too much at once
and we're useless.

862
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:47,430
- It's a professor thing.
- Just go with it.

863
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:52,140
So I have Bax spreading you
too thin to affect your hosts

864
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:54,110
mentally or physically.

865
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:58,050
You won't be able
to control them anymore.

866
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,910
You're killing me.

867
00:39:58,950 --> 00:39:59,950
No.

868
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:04,020
Don't worry, you'll be
a part of your host forever.

869
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:06,320
You're just getting quieter.

870
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:24,140
This is
the worst fucking job ever.

871
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:27,740
Penny, are you okay?

872
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,740
Got your page.

873
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,980
Did you know why you wanted it?

874
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:35,220
It's fading, but...

875
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:37,520
to sell.

876
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:40,650
There was this huge debt to pay.

877
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:43,120
I don't know what for, but...

878
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,160
when The Couple came
to collect, we didn't...

879
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:48,030
they didn't ask any questions.

880
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,060
A couple of?

881
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:52,100
- No.
- The Couple.

882
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:55,870
Weird name, but I remember
feeling scared shitless.

883
00:40:55,900 --> 00:41:00,940
The Couple has power.
It has resources.

884
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,610
It's been looking for the
World Seed page a long time,

885
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,750
and they are not good people.

886
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:08,020
And they know
I have what they want.

887
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:08,950
I don't think that's gonna be

888
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,690
the last person or thing
to come after it.

889
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:15,460
The hell was Coldwater doing

890
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:17,830
with instructions
to something so powerful?

891
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,690
Yeah.

892
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:23,630
I have no idea.

893
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,900
Jesus Christ, El.
You had one job:

894
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:28,740
Don't blow up
my relationship with Josh.

895
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:29,740
And what did you do?

896
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:30,640
I'm sorry.

897
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,810
There's no way
to avoid that conversation.

898
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:36,040
He's just so goddamn persistent.

899
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,210
Tell me about it.

900
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,280
By the by,

901
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:40,310
Charlton's gonna go hang out
in your beach memories

902
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:41,250
for a while.

903
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,220
Think the whole Seb thing
was hard on him.

904
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:46,020
So um, what did
you and Seb talk about?

905
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:48,860
You know, before?

906
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:50,190
Don't do this to yourself.

907
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,890
I ended your relationship.

908
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:54,760
Seems like I deserve whatever
pain's coming my way.

909
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,960
That wasn't your fault.

910
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,770
You were just dealing
with some shit I set up

911
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,070
way before you took over.

912
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,770
So in summation,

913
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,670
we're both equally skilled at
destroying our own happiness?

914
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:06,470
Yeah.

915
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:10,180
Well, at least we used
our powers for good?

916
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:13,986
How fucked up is it
that I miss him?

917
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:18,250
El, there's
nothing wrong with you.

918
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:19,190
He was hot and complicated.

919
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:21,360
Those are the ones
worth banging.

920
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:23,620
You've just had some shitty luck

921
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,230
with boys so far, that's all.

922
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,190
It doesn't mean
you don't deserve love

923
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:30,330
or that you won't ever find it.

924
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:33,800
Well, at least I have
better luck with friends.
