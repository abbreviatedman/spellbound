00:00:00,137 --> 00:00:01,359
<i>Previously on The Magicians</i>...

2
00:00:01,479 --> 00:00:02,511
Have you ever
heard of Brakebills?

3
00:00:02,596 --> 00:00:04,385
<i>- No.</i>
<i>- It's, like, this secret Yale,</i>

4
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:06,501
and you have to be able
to do magic to even get in.

5
00:00:06,512 --> 00:00:09,341
<i>- Well, I can do magic.</i>
<i>- Yeah, so can I.</i>

6
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:10,619
<i>Sorry, I just got</i>
<i>your e-mail.</i>

7
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:11,989
<i>My fifth e-mail.</i>

8
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:13,405
<i>Just tell me</i>
<i>what you meant by--</i>

9
00:00:13,491 --> 00:00:15,821
I mean not herself.
I mean barely talks to me.

10
00:00:15,906 --> 00:00:18,202
<i>She looks like a goddamn ghost.</i>
<i>She's not Julia.</i>

11
00:00:18,288 --> 00:00:19,818
I need you to tell them
they were wrong about me.

12
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,018
Tell them to test me again.

13
00:00:21,087 --> 00:00:22,484
I'm sorry, but they would know.

14
00:00:22,569 --> 00:00:23,866
It's really okay
if this is not your thing.

15
00:00:23,951 --> 00:00:25,865
- So you are--
- Top bitch in New York.

16
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,363
I'm willing to teach the right
people everything I know.

17
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:29,896
- Who are we trying to contact?
- Charlie.

18
00:00:29,981 --> 00:00:32,394
- And who's Charlie?
- My brother. He died.

19
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,643
Jesus, we could not have
screwed up that spell worse,

20
00:00:34,695 --> 00:00:35,734
and we can't take it back.

21
00:00:59,297 --> 00:01:00,628
<i>Now that you're in,</i>

22
00:01:00,713 --> 00:01:03,958
it's time to learn some magic.

23
00:01:04,044 --> 00:01:05,291
Just don't get too excited.

24
00:01:05,343 --> 00:01:07,457
Start slow.

25
00:01:07,542 --> 00:01:10,371
Yeah, I don't really do slow.

26
00:01:10,457 --> 00:01:11,788
Hmm...

27
00:01:20,618 --> 00:01:22,947
<i>Being a magician</i>
<i>has always been,</i>

28
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,697
<i>in part,</i>

29
00:01:24,783 --> 00:01:28,943
<i>about accruing power.</i>

30
00:01:29,029 --> 00:01:31,442
Power over yourself,

31
00:01:31,527 --> 00:01:33,108
the elements.

32
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:35,191
- Power over the future.
- He's back.

33
00:01:35,275 --> 00:01:38,355
The very world
that exists around you...

34
00:01:38,441 --> 00:01:39,821
He said he had an announcement.

35
00:01:39,906 --> 00:01:43,102
But power, as you all know,

36
00:01:43,154 --> 00:01:44,769
does not come cheaply.

37
00:01:46,436 --> 00:01:50,148
<i>There are reasons</i>
<i>we teach this curriculum</i>

38
00:01:50,234 --> 00:01:52,929
<i>precisely the way that we do.</i>

39
00:01:52,981 --> 00:01:54,511
<i>Skipping around,</i>

40
00:01:54,597 --> 00:01:56,261
<i>focusing on</i>
<i>all the wrong things,</i>

41
00:01:56,346 --> 00:01:57,843
<i>lack of guidance...</i>

42
00:01:57,928 --> 00:02:00,675
<i>these are all</i>
<i>extremely dangerous.</i>

43
00:02:00,761 --> 00:02:04,473
<i>There are certain energies,</i>
<i>certain spells,</i>

44
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:09,253
<i>which are far too powerful</i>
<i>for one magician alone.</i>

45
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:13,301
If you lose control,
they will turn against you.

46
00:02:13,387 --> 00:02:16,965
They will kill you.
They will consume you.

47
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,914
Change you...

48
00:02:18,966 --> 00:02:20,913
into something else.

49
00:02:39,903 --> 00:02:43,566
Now that I have your attention.

50
00:02:43,651 --> 00:02:46,148
We test
to discern your discipline.

51
00:02:46,233 --> 00:02:48,446
Your area of concentration.

52
00:02:48,531 --> 00:02:49,730
It is what you are,

53
00:02:49,815 --> 00:02:51,395
and with the right guidance,

54
00:02:51,447 --> 00:02:53,061
you may safely rise

55
00:02:53,146 --> 00:02:55,942
to unknowable heights.

56
00:02:56,028 --> 00:02:57,641
You will find
your scheduled times

57
00:02:57,727 --> 00:02:59,723
and invitations
inside your bags.

58
00:03:08,636 --> 00:03:10,050
Hey, babe, it's me.

59
00:03:10,136 --> 00:03:11,799
Um, ahem, just got your message.

60
00:03:11,884 --> 00:03:15,714
I'm so sorry, I got stuck.
Be there as soon as I can.

61
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:17,130
Love you.

62
00:03:23,794 --> 00:03:26,457
Never gets old, does it?

63
00:03:26,543 --> 00:03:28,089
Having a secret.

64
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:30,588
You have magic.

65
00:03:30,673 --> 00:03:33,536
They don't.

66
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,285
Better than money.

67
00:03:35,371 --> 00:03:38,200
Better than sex.

68
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:39,949
Well, I guess that one depends.

69
00:03:40,034 --> 00:03:42,414
James is cool, really.
He barely notices.

70
00:03:42,499 --> 00:03:46,362
We've both been
so busy with school.

71
00:03:46,414 --> 00:03:48,777
Look...

72
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:51,075
we all juggle.

73
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:53,607
You're kicking ass.

74
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:56,605
Just don't forget
to manage your shit.

75
00:03:56,691 --> 00:03:58,129
Don't want boyfriend
getting worried,

76
00:03:58,157 --> 00:03:59,688
following you
to the safe house door.

77
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:02,852
Got it covered, okay.

78
00:04:02,904 --> 00:04:04,600
I know you do.

79
00:04:04,686 --> 00:04:07,016
Just saying.

80
00:04:07,102 --> 00:04:09,565
Yes, these are promising.

81
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,731
I get a strong sense of blues

82
00:04:11,815 --> 00:04:15,011
and...and pinks.

83
00:04:15,063 --> 00:04:16,760
Is that Alice Quinn?

84
00:04:16,845 --> 00:04:19,925
Alice, please sit,
if there's a seat.

85
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,557
Bit of a transition.

86
00:04:21,642 --> 00:04:23,757
I find that I prefer an office
that I can reach

87
00:04:23,841 --> 00:04:25,588
without falling down
three flights of steps

88
00:04:25,674 --> 00:04:26,838
that I cannot see.

89
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:28,720
This'll be quick, Alice.

90
00:04:28,805 --> 00:04:30,885
Show Professor March
what you can do.

91
00:04:35,585 --> 00:04:37,332
Like I said, I used to do
a lot of coin and card tricks,

92
00:04:37,384 --> 00:04:38,714
and I guess sometimes

93
00:04:38,799 --> 00:04:40,163
I, like, actually used
real magic.

94
00:04:40,248 --> 00:04:42,495
Predictions could mean psychic.

95
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:45,210
Vanishing could mean illusions
or physical magic.

96
00:04:45,296 --> 00:04:47,158
Curious.

97
00:04:47,243 --> 00:04:48,375
What? What's curious?

98
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,540
Now, try holding these.

99
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:54,404
Think the alphabet in Greek.

100
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,704
No.

101
00:04:55,789 --> 00:04:58,902
Just lovely, Miss Quinn.

102
00:04:58,987 --> 00:05:01,151
So clean.
Very advanced.

103
00:05:01,235 --> 00:05:02,533
- Physical magic.
- Hm.

104
00:05:02,618 --> 00:05:04,148
Definitely.

105
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,389
Just stare at it.

106
00:05:20,974 --> 00:05:23,055
Well, you're not an herbalist.

107
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,686
Undetermined?
Can they do that?

108
00:05:25,771 --> 00:05:27,718
Yeah, Sunderland said
it happens,

109
00:05:27,803 --> 00:05:31,133
so I guess they'll
try again next year.

Phosphoromancy.

114
00:05:42,544 --> 00:05:44,791
I bend light.

115
00:05:44,843 --> 00:05:46,956
Holy shit!

116
00:05:47,042 --> 00:05:48,623

I couldn't tell.

158
00:08:27,862 --> 00:08:29,692
You know, it should have worked.

159
00:08:30,945 --> 00:08:33,574
That spell we did
to reach my brother.

160
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:37,105
I mean, I went over it,
like, a million times.

161
00:08:37,191 --> 00:08:40,020
Should have?
You saying that like you...

162
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:42,019
wanna do it again.

163
00:08:42,071 --> 00:08:44,184
Wait, you don't wanna
try it again, do you?

164
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:47,182
I need to know the truth,
that's all.

165
00:08:47,267 --> 00:08:50,847
You know, the spell
we did was, like...

166
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:52,845
I don't know,
it was like a phone call.

167
00:08:52,931 --> 00:08:55,893
We made contact,
but he didn't pick up,

168
00:08:55,979 --> 00:08:58,092
so then The Beast picked up.

169
00:08:58,178 --> 00:08:59,342
But that still leaves
the question,

170
00:08:59,427 --> 00:09:01,391
"Where's Charlie?"

171
00:09:01,476 --> 00:09:04,721
Well, the last time we asked
that question, somebody died.

172
00:09:04,807 --> 00:09:06,004
Never mind.

173
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:07,837
What do you care?

174
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:10,552
No.

175
00:09:10,637 --> 00:09:12,551
I do. I care.
I wanna help.

176
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:15,665
I just--I don't--

177
00:09:19,715 --> 00:09:20,912
Ooh, oh. Yeah.

178
00:09:20,997 --> 00:09:22,378
Um...

179
00:09:22,463 --> 00:09:25,875
have you read Teukolsky yet?

180
00:09:25,961 --> 00:09:27,742
Uh, so apparently

181
00:09:27,827 --> 00:09:30,040
you can find deceased spirits

182
00:09:30,126 --> 00:09:31,822
with a simple locator spell.

183
00:09:31,874 --> 00:09:33,489
If they wanna be found.

184
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:36,236
That's stupid.

185
00:09:36,322 --> 00:09:39,284
You're stupid.
You have a stupid face.

186
00:09:41,152 --> 00:09:44,365
Uh, anyone have a match?

187
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,646
Uh, it's not working.

188
00:09:46,698 --> 00:09:48,645
Just keep walking.

189
00:09:51,645 --> 00:09:55,308
Okay.
Finally.

190
00:09:56,975 --> 00:09:58,856
Guess it's Woof Fountain.

191
00:09:58,942 --> 00:10:01,971
Ugh. I never liked
this thing.

192
00:10:02,023 --> 00:10:04,686
Eliot says
it's enchanted as shit.

193
00:10:06,104 --> 00:10:09,016
Supposedly it's bottomless,

194
00:10:09,102 --> 00:10:10,383
so you know
the psychics love it.

195
00:10:10,469 --> 00:10:11,965
Suicide fountain.

196
00:10:12,017 --> 00:10:14,846
You don't think
your brother--

197
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:16,596
No.

198
00:10:16,631 --> 00:10:17,928
He wasn't that kinda guy.

199
00:10:17,963 --> 00:10:20,127
He was the kinda guy
who always wanted

200
00:10:20,129 --> 00:10:23,624
to fix things
for everyone around him.

201
00:10:23,626 --> 00:10:26,589
He was really, really good.

202
00:10:26,674 --> 00:10:28,421
You know that spell I did
on the first day of class?

203
00:10:28,507 --> 00:10:30,455
The Glass Horse?

204
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,953
He taught me that.

205
00:10:46,163 --> 00:10:49,076
Come on, let's go.
Nothing's happening.

206
00:11:10,123 --> 00:11:11,827
The whole thing is fucking pointless.

207
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:13,397
Psychic?

208
00:11:13,483 --> 00:11:15,229
I wanna punch Sunderland
in the throat.

209
00:11:15,315 --> 00:11:16,895
You know, as a psychic,
you'd think

210
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,594
- you'd have seen all this coming.
- Oh, woman, please.

211
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,260
Ah!

212
00:11:22,143 --> 00:11:23,757
Hold on.

213
00:11:27,091 --> 00:11:28,387
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa whoa.

214
00:11:28,473 --> 00:11:29,752
Are we actually
doing this again?

215
00:11:29,756 --> 00:11:31,114
Do you know how
to close your mind?

216
00:11:31,171 --> 00:11:32,919
'Cause I will show you
right now.

217
00:11:33,004 --> 00:11:34,551
I thought I was.
Eliot gave me a--

218
00:11:34,636 --> 00:11:36,051
Seriously, man?

219
00:11:36,136 --> 00:11:37,916
Taylor Swift?

220
00:11:38,051 --> 00:11:39,964
I am not singing Taylor Swift

221
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,831
in my head.

222
00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:48,742
Okay, I'll work on it.

223
00:11:48,828 --> 00:11:50,574
Jeez.

224
00:11:56,572 --> 00:12:00,036
So, it's got lots of space.
Lots of light.

225
00:12:00,121 --> 00:12:03,567
It looks really great.

226
00:12:03,702 --> 00:12:05,615
I'm sorry, I guess
I thought you were still

227
00:12:05,734 --> 00:12:08,231
considering Yale
for the fall with me.

228
00:12:08,316 --> 00:12:09,563
What?

229
00:12:09,649 --> 00:12:12,611
Okay, can we just
talk about this now?

230
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,061
Where is your head?

231
00:12:14,195 --> 00:12:16,558
Why do I feel like
I'm talking to myself?

232
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,190
I'm--I've just been busy
with class--

233
00:12:19,276 --> 00:12:20,475
Are you seeing someone else?

234
00:12:20,526 --> 00:12:22,389
No! Why would you
ask that?

235
00:12:22,474 --> 00:12:24,105
Because you're different.

236
00:12:24,224 --> 00:12:26,553
You stand me up.
You don't answer your phone.

237
00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:29,052
I'm just--I'm starting
to feel like the asshole.

238
00:12:29,187 --> 00:12:31,550
You're not.

239
00:12:33,135 --> 00:12:35,848
Hey...

240
00:12:35,933 --> 00:12:37,880
I love you.

241
00:12:38,016 --> 00:12:40,878
You know that.

242
00:12:40,963 --> 00:12:42,877
Look, I know
I've been moody lately,

243
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,043
but...

244
00:12:44,178 --> 00:12:47,091
I feel a lot better.

245
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:49,873
James, come on.

246
00:12:52,374 --> 00:12:54,254
Hey.

247
00:12:56,004 --> 00:12:57,534
Mm.

248
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:00,083
Okay, go on.

249
00:13:00,202 --> 00:13:01,499
Someone killed themselves
in the fountain?

250
00:13:01,584 --> 00:13:03,531
Try 15 students and one dean.

251
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:06,863
Van Pelt.
Fountain's named after him.

252
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:10,743
It does feel a little bit off
here though, doesn't it?

253
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:16,856
Brief announcement.

254
00:13:16,992 --> 00:13:20,854
The Van Pelt fountain is
temporarily off limits.

255
00:13:20,939 --> 00:13:22,354
There's been an incursion.

256
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:29,016
We believe it's
a garden variety haunting.

257
00:13:29,151 --> 00:13:32,514
Redrawing the wards
may have released it

258
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,013
much like a mouse caught
in the walls of a building.

259
00:13:35,098 --> 00:13:36,345
Help!

260
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,843
No one was seriously hurt.

261
00:13:38,928 --> 00:13:40,976
Both students involved
are recuperating

262
00:13:41,061 --> 00:13:43,175
in the infirmary.

263
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:44,889
Regardless,

264
00:13:45,008 --> 00:13:48,755
stay away until we lock it down.

265
00:13:50,005 --> 00:13:51,836
Ow. I mean,
what if it was Charlie?

266
00:13:51,921 --> 00:13:54,051
I don't know.
Maybe.

267
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:57,666
If not, it's
a pretty big coincidence.

268
00:13:57,751 --> 00:13:58,998
But if it was Charlie,
don't you think

269
00:13:59,133 --> 00:14:00,331
that he would have
reached out to you

270
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:01,712
directly...

271
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,543
Maybe he just did.

272
00:14:13,107 --> 00:14:14,547
It's definitely Charlie.

273
00:14:16,005 --> 00:14:17,386
Okay.

274
00:14:20,469 --> 00:14:22,582
So, why would he try
and drown a bunch of psychics.

275
00:14:22,717 --> 00:14:25,414
Uh, have you met them?

276
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:28,379
Are you two talking about
what happened at Woof?

277
00:14:28,464 --> 00:14:31,294
I--that was
a private conversation.

278
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:34,242
= You know.
Well, meow.

279
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,455
What was that?

280
00:14:39,574 --> 00:14:41,903
I just--I don't trust her.

281
00:14:41,989 --> 00:14:44,902
Okay, look.
I just--

282
00:14:44,988 --> 00:14:47,567
I think trying to drown people
seems a little violent.

283
00:14:47,702 --> 00:14:49,460
He may not have even
known what he was doing.

284
00:14:49,535 --> 00:14:51,698
I mean, spirits,
they can get confused.

285
00:14:51,784 --> 00:14:53,102
Okay, then how do we talk to him

286
00:14:53,149 --> 00:14:56,229
without him trying to drown us?

287
00:14:56,314 --> 00:14:59,227
I don't know.

288
00:14:59,363 --> 00:15:01,225
But first thing's first.
I found a spell--

289
00:15:01,361 --> 00:15:03,225
well, five actually, but they
all have their own down side.

290
00:15:03,311 --> 00:15:05,028
Like, we don't know
how Charlie died exactly

291
00:15:05,108 --> 00:15:06,357
and the moon is
in the wrong spot right now.

292
00:15:06,442 --> 00:15:08,022
Look, I know
you don't trust her,

293
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,887
- but maybe Margo could--
- Or there's a Maori spell.

294
00:15:10,022 --> 00:15:12,385
I'd have to cut off a finger,
but they might be preferable.

295
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,268
To talking to Margo?

296
00:15:14,387 --> 00:15:18,098
Quentin, I need your help.
Highest priority.

297
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,182
- Let's go.
- Okay.

298
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:22,180
I--hey, look,
you said it yourself,

299
00:15:22,265 --> 00:15:23,424
you don't have all the facts,

300
00:15:23,515 --> 00:15:24,878
so maybe you don't need a spell.

301
00:15:25,014 --> 00:15:26,261
Maybe you need information,

302
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,258
and Margo's Discipline
is gossip, so...

303
00:15:40,255 --> 00:15:42,752
We have a real problem.

304
00:15:42,869 --> 00:15:44,083
Is it in the box?

305
00:15:45,668 --> 00:15:47,532
Professor Sunderland
came looking for a book

306
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,697
from the Physical
Cottage Library,

307
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,413
and it's missing.

308
00:15:51,532 --> 00:15:52,729
I diverted
her attention, but--

309
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,028
What does that have to do with the box?

310
00:15:54,163 --> 00:15:56,327
Books at Brakebills, Quentin,

311
00:15:56,412 --> 00:15:57,526
are not just books.

312
00:15:57,611 --> 00:15:58,858
One goes missing, it's not just

313
00:15:58,993 --> 00:16:00,657
a library fine
we're talking about here.

314
00:16:00,742 --> 00:16:03,072
- What're we talking about?
- We're talking about--

315
00:16:03,191 --> 00:16:05,521
we have...

316
00:16:05,656 --> 00:16:07,353
occasional parties.

317
00:16:07,438 --> 00:16:09,019
During one, someone took a book,

318
00:16:09,155 --> 00:16:10,735
and if we don't find that book

319
00:16:10,853 --> 00:16:12,849
the faculty are going to take
a harder look at our parties,

320
00:16:12,935 --> 00:16:14,599
and that cannot happen, Quentin.

321
00:16:17,349 --> 00:16:20,179
So you gonna tell me
what's in the box or...

322
00:16:24,594 --> 00:16:26,391
What the hell is that?

323
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,007
The missing book is Volume One.

324
00:16:28,143 --> 00:16:31,589
That...is Volume Two.

325
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:37,169
She's going to lead us
to her mate.

326
00:16:37,255 --> 00:16:39,001
Oh.

327
00:16:39,136 --> 00:16:41,749
<i>Odemknout.</i>

328
00:16:44,882 --> 00:16:46,829
<i>Odemknout.</i>

329
00:16:46,915 --> 00:16:48,296
Shit.

330
00:16:48,381 --> 00:16:50,161
Uh, let me--
let me try it again.

331
00:16:50,296 --> 00:16:53,126
Should be easy.
You're distracted.

332
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:55,041
I know I have a lot going on.

333
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:56,519
No, you don't.
You have this spell.

334
00:16:56,576 --> 00:16:58,156
That's it.

335
00:17:00,157 --> 00:17:03,319
So how do you manage it all?

336
00:17:03,404 --> 00:17:06,484
Juggling magic and your life?

337
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:10,782
I don't understand the question.

338
00:17:10,867 --> 00:17:12,481
I'm not judging you.

339
00:17:12,616 --> 00:17:16,028
I started out like you
and you have a good life.

340
00:17:16,147 --> 00:17:17,944
Boyfriend.

341
00:17:18,029 --> 00:17:20,143
Probably think
he keeps you centered.

342
00:17:20,229 --> 00:17:22,192
- Right?
- Kinda.

343
00:17:22,311 --> 00:17:26,139
Or, you know, you're keeping
him around in case you fail here

344
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:28,970
and need to fall back.

345
00:17:29,056 --> 00:17:31,802
All I know...
you have to mean it

346
00:17:31,938 --> 00:17:33,269
for magic to work.

347
00:17:33,354 --> 00:17:36,933
Something clicks
when you're all-in,

348
00:17:37,018 --> 00:17:41,630
and the real big stuff,
you can't do it

349
00:17:41,715 --> 00:17:44,844
till you're doing it
without a net.

350
00:17:57,788 --> 00:18:00,452
I...

351
00:18:00,587 --> 00:18:01,918
I need your help.

352
00:18:02,003 --> 00:18:05,116
That wasn't so hard, was it?

353
00:18:07,117 --> 00:18:08,664
Look, I'm just trying

354
00:18:08,782 --> 00:18:10,613
to find out what happened
to my brother.

355
00:18:10,748 --> 00:18:13,111
He was a student here
five years ago.

356
00:18:13,247 --> 00:18:14,993
Okay.

357
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,273
He was a physical kid.

358
00:18:20,358 --> 00:18:22,821
His name was Charlie,

359
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,271
and he died.

360
00:18:24,356 --> 00:18:28,236
Know what?
I did hear about that.

361
00:18:28,321 --> 00:18:30,401
At Woof, right?

362
00:18:30,487 --> 00:18:33,766
Five, six years back?

363
00:18:33,851 --> 00:18:35,564
It's all making sense now.

364
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,730
- What is?
- You.

365
00:18:37,814 --> 00:18:39,562
The awkward thing.

366
00:18:39,648 --> 00:18:42,759
The anger underneath
the ineffable air of tragedy

367
00:18:42,895 --> 00:18:45,426
you wear like a perfume.

368
00:18:47,343 --> 00:18:50,306
Look, can you just tell me
what you know about Charlie?

369
00:18:50,425 --> 00:18:52,387
- Please?
- Loathe as I am to admit it,

370
00:18:52,473 --> 00:18:56,136
I don't actually know anything.

371
00:18:56,254 --> 00:18:58,218
Although, there was a girl

372
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,749
from Charlie's year who might.

373
00:19:00,835 --> 00:19:03,248
Emily Greenstreet.

374
00:19:03,383 --> 00:19:04,747
Who was she?

375
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,213
Just a girl.

376
00:19:06,298 --> 00:19:08,878
When he died,
apparently she took it hard.

377
00:19:08,963 --> 00:19:10,793
Dropped out.
Gave up magic.

378
00:19:10,912 --> 00:19:12,375
The Full Muggle.

379
00:19:12,461 --> 00:19:14,241
It was a bit of a scandal.

380
00:19:14,326 --> 00:19:15,624
Where is she now?

381
00:19:15,742 --> 00:19:16,873
The city.

382
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,406
Fogg set her up with a job

383
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:21,737
which is how you know
they're hiding something big.

384
00:19:21,873 --> 00:19:23,952
I know how to find her.

385
00:19:24,071 --> 00:19:25,401
Come on, I'll show you.

386
00:19:25,486 --> 00:19:27,867
I'd actually prefer to go alone.

387
00:19:27,952 --> 00:19:31,114
Oh, I know you would, but...

388
00:19:31,233 --> 00:19:33,230
what choice do you really have?

389
00:19:44,143 --> 00:19:46,522
Penny.

390
00:19:46,608 --> 00:19:49,887
Welcome.
Knew you were coming.

391
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,603
I know you've been
dreading this,

392
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,934
but you're gonna like it.

393
00:19:54,052 --> 00:19:57,183
The coves are for meditation

394
00:19:57,267 --> 00:19:59,880
while the enclosed
"Consciousness Areas"

395
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:03,429
are reserved as a place
to cry, and process.

396
00:20:06,429 --> 00:20:07,876
Hm.

397
00:20:07,962 --> 00:20:10,208
We call it "The Amplifier."

398
00:20:10,293 --> 00:20:12,340
So basically, it's like turning

399
00:20:12,426 --> 00:20:14,422
your psychic powers up to 11.

400
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,038
Why would you wanna do that?

401
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:17,703
Oh, I get it.

402
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:20,169
You're one of those guys
who's trying to shut it out.

403
00:20:20,254 --> 00:20:22,367
You wanna get control of it

404
00:20:22,452 --> 00:20:25,865
or it will mess up your shit
big time,

405
00:20:26,001 --> 00:20:27,864
and this is the best place
to practice.

406
00:20:27,949 --> 00:20:30,413
So...

407
00:20:30,532 --> 00:20:31,662
I do what?

408
00:20:31,747 --> 00:20:32,861
Sit.

409
00:20:32,947 --> 00:20:34,161
Relax.

410
00:20:34,245 --> 00:20:35,859
Let your mind wander.

411
00:20:35,945 --> 00:20:37,192
It's pretty simple.

412
00:20:37,327 --> 00:20:39,574
But you gotta start
by letting go, tough guy.

413
00:20:39,692 --> 00:20:42,405
Less talking.

414
00:20:42,524 --> 00:20:43,688
No touching.

415
00:21:11,557 --> 00:21:13,221
<i>Help!</i>

416
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,719
<i>Please!</i>
<i>Help me!</i>

417
00:21:26,636 --> 00:21:28,266
Emily?

418
00:21:29,717 --> 00:21:31,048
No, don't run.

419
00:21:31,133 --> 00:21:32,714
These shoes are insane.

420
00:21:35,798 --> 00:21:38,410
You're from Brakebills,
aren't you?

421
00:21:38,862 --> 00:21:40,426
That part of my life
is behind me.

422
00:21:40,544 --> 00:21:43,257
- I'm sorry.
- Charlie was my brother.

423
00:21:49,664 --> 00:21:53,160
I just wanna know
what happened to him.

424
00:21:53,295 --> 00:21:56,625
Your brother saved my life.

425
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,823
Well, he tried to at least.

426
00:21:59,958 --> 00:22:02,988
So, I fell for this professor.

427
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:05,319
I know how it sounds,

428
00:22:05,455 --> 00:22:08,317
but I was young and...

429
00:22:08,453 --> 00:22:11,315
and he loved me.

430
00:22:11,401 --> 00:22:15,198
But then, well, he was married.

431
00:22:15,315 --> 00:22:17,312
You know how it is
when you're that age.

432
00:22:17,398 --> 00:22:20,694
You get...terrible ideas.

433
00:22:20,813 --> 00:22:23,276
Hmm.

434
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,524
Like what?

435
00:22:25,643 --> 00:22:29,305
I thought I could
make him love me again.

436
00:22:29,441 --> 00:22:31,470
Oh, some kind of love spell?

437
00:22:31,606 --> 00:22:34,635
No.

438
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:36,517
No.

439
00:22:36,636 --> 00:22:41,432
I thought if I could
make myself prettier.

440
00:22:41,516 --> 00:22:44,014
Oh...God.

441
00:22:44,133 --> 00:22:46,295
No one warned you
how dangerous that was?

442
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:49,260
I knew, but I'd convinced myself

443
00:22:49,345 --> 00:22:53,923
that it was the only way.

444
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:56,789
It took me weeks

445
00:22:56,874 --> 00:22:59,587
to figure out how to do it,

446
00:22:59,672 --> 00:23:02,285
and...

447
00:23:02,371 --> 00:23:04,751
<i>when I did, well, you--</i>

448
00:23:04,836 --> 00:23:06,450
<i>you can imagine how that went.</i>

449
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,944
No...

450
00:23:24,607 --> 00:23:28,104
I was gonna--I was
gonna kill myself.

451
00:23:28,189 --> 00:23:30,901
Emily!

452
00:23:30,987 --> 00:23:33,067
Wait!

453
00:23:33,153 --> 00:23:35,266
What happened?

454
00:23:35,402 --> 00:23:37,264
What did you do?

455
00:23:42,597 --> 00:23:44,760
Please.

456
00:23:44,845 --> 00:23:47,592
I just wanna help.

457
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,717
Don't tell anyone, please.

458
00:24:01,802 --> 00:24:03,049
Course not.

459
00:24:03,135 --> 00:24:04,631
Wait here.
I'll be back.

460
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,247
I'm gonna fix this.

461
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:12,460
He mashed a...

462
00:24:12,578 --> 00:24:13,910
bunch of stuff together.

463
00:24:13,995 --> 00:24:15,741
<i>It was--</i>

464
00:24:15,826 --> 00:24:17,291
<i>It was totally untested.</i>

465
00:24:19,325 --> 00:24:21,571
I really believed

466
00:24:21,707 --> 00:24:24,736
he might actually
be able to undo what I did.

467
00:24:24,871 --> 00:24:27,867
He was a good magician.

468
00:24:27,953 --> 00:24:30,067
You know, he--

469
00:24:30,201 --> 00:24:34,115
he woulda done anything for me.

470
00:24:34,232 --> 00:24:36,229
<i>It was a lot.</i>
<i>It was--it was--</i>

471
00:24:36,315 --> 00:24:39,227
It was too much.

472
00:24:39,363 --> 00:24:43,275
I begged him to stop,
but he wouldn't,

473
00:24:43,394 --> 00:24:46,723
and that's when it went
totally out of control.

474
00:24:57,136 --> 00:24:59,432
It burned...

475
00:24:59,551 --> 00:25:02,681
right through him...

476
00:25:02,766 --> 00:25:07,177
until he wasn't there anymore.

477
00:25:07,262 --> 00:25:10,676
He was--
Do you know what a Niffin is?

478
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:14,874
- No.
- Yes.

479
00:25:14,959 --> 00:25:16,838
It's when too much
runs through you.

480
00:25:16,924 --> 00:25:19,038
Consumes you.

481
00:25:19,172 --> 00:25:22,086
Only the magic is left,

482
00:25:22,204 --> 00:25:25,034
but you're not

483
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:26,250
you anymore.

484
00:25:26,367 --> 00:25:28,582
You're...

485
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:31,530
lost.

486
00:25:31,666 --> 00:25:34,029
Where did Charlie go?

487
00:25:34,114 --> 00:25:35,494
I don't know.

488
00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:39,492
He was just gone.

489
00:25:39,577 --> 00:25:41,857
I never saw him again.

490
00:25:41,992 --> 00:25:44,689
Um, who did all this then?

491
00:25:46,939 --> 00:25:49,070
My professor.

492
00:25:49,187 --> 00:25:52,350
Well, I guess you got
his attention after all.

493
00:25:52,436 --> 00:25:53,733
I quit school.

494
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:56,315
Gave up magic,
and never looked back.

495
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,928
I'm so sorry about Charlie.

496
00:26:05,395 --> 00:26:08,675
Hear that?
She's getting excited.

497
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:11,007
I think we're close.

498
00:26:11,092 --> 00:26:13,422
Hold this, will you?

499
00:26:17,388 --> 00:26:21,333
This bodega is warded
up the ass.

500
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,330
Hedge witches.

501
00:26:26,416 --> 00:26:28,995
Amateurs.
Magical D-leaguers.

502
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,328
Sad and desperate people.

503
00:26:31,463 --> 00:26:34,293
Once one of 'em offered
to blow me for a spell.

504
00:26:34,378 --> 00:26:36,791
It was fairly worth it.

505
00:26:36,877 --> 00:26:38,156
Let me do the talking.

506
00:27:02,478 --> 00:27:03,641
These are witches?

507
00:27:03,776 --> 00:27:06,023
Hm. Pathetic. No?

508
00:27:06,141 --> 00:27:09,971
Ugh, this kid's trying
Popper number four.

509
00:27:10,106 --> 00:27:12,220
It's painful.

510
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,715
Hear you're selling something.

511
00:27:21,132 --> 00:27:23,096
Quentin?

512
00:27:23,181 --> 00:27:25,295
Oh, hey.

513
00:27:30,646 --> 00:27:32,635
- What the hell are you doing here?
- What the hell are you doing here?

514
00:27:32,755 --> 00:27:34,385
You know these guys?

515
00:27:34,504 --> 00:27:35,782
Yeah, they're from Brakebills.

516
00:27:35,803 --> 00:27:36,885
- We're friends.
- That's right.

517
00:27:37,004 --> 00:27:38,125
We're from Brakebills.

518
00:27:38,245 --> 00:27:41,298
We're classically trained
and we want our book.

519
00:27:41,383 --> 00:27:44,130
We don't have your stupid book.

520
00:27:55,492 --> 00:27:57,321
Are they?

521
00:27:58,707 --> 00:28:00,120
Yep.

522
00:28:00,205 --> 00:28:01,403
Love wins.

523
00:28:15,564 --> 00:28:17,027
Hey!

524
00:28:17,145 --> 00:28:18,359
So, that's it?

525
00:28:18,478 --> 00:28:19,643
That's all you're
gonna say to me?

526
00:28:19,726 --> 00:28:21,307
Don't talk to her.
Keep going.

527
00:28:21,443 --> 00:28:23,440
I don't know what
you're doing here, Jules.

528
00:28:23,525 --> 00:28:25,273
You're better than this.

529
00:28:25,357 --> 00:28:27,021
You say that
like I had a choice.

530
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:28,470
- Of course you have a choice.
- No, because guess what?

531
00:28:28,605 --> 00:28:31,351
Magic wasn't just handed to me.

532
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:35,499
I told you to please
tell them about me.

533
00:28:35,602 --> 00:28:37,298
At first, you know,
I thought maybe

534
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:39,431
they'd actually test me again,

535
00:28:39,516 --> 00:28:41,096
and then I figured someone
would at least come

536
00:28:41,181 --> 00:28:44,127
and try to take my memory
again, and then...

537
00:28:44,213 --> 00:28:46,793
just waiting.

538
00:28:46,928 --> 00:28:48,291
It took me weeks to realize

539
00:28:48,377 --> 00:28:52,256
you never even
told them about me at all.

540
00:28:52,341 --> 00:28:55,005
- Look, Jules, I--
- You were my best friend.

541
00:28:55,122 --> 00:28:57,786
Yeah, and so I let it go.

542
00:28:57,871 --> 00:29:00,251
What does that mean,
"you let it go?"

543
00:29:00,336 --> 00:29:01,951
No, that's crazy,
I can actually do--

544
00:29:02,086 --> 00:29:04,499
The people at Brakebills,
Jules, they can bend light.

545
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:06,164
They can read minds.
They can fly.

546
00:29:06,282 --> 00:29:08,413
You can do a party trick.

547
00:29:11,530 --> 00:29:13,493
So this is it, huh?

548
00:29:13,612 --> 00:29:15,325
The real you.

549
00:29:15,444 --> 00:29:18,107
Do you ever stop to think
about how maybe you treated me?

550
00:29:18,193 --> 00:29:19,773
What?

551
00:29:19,907 --> 00:29:21,322
I was always there--

552
00:29:21,441 --> 00:29:23,238
What? You were so nice
and you were so sweet

553
00:29:23,322 --> 00:29:26,269
to poor little Q who couldn't
get his shit together.

554
00:29:26,354 --> 00:29:28,100
- Don't put that on me.
- Between you and James it was

555
00:29:28,236 --> 00:29:29,767
- a two for one charity case.
- That's your interpretation.

556
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:31,599
- Why are you saying this?
- Because that is true, Julia!

557
00:29:31,684 --> 00:29:35,564
- No, that's not true. I--
- You know how I felt about you.

558
00:29:35,649 --> 00:29:37,312
- I don't know what--
- Admit it. Just admit it.

559
00:29:37,431 --> 00:29:39,344
Admit it.

560
00:29:42,261 --> 00:29:44,091
So, you're gonna
punish me for that?

561
00:29:44,227 --> 00:29:46,090
I don't know what else to say.

562
00:29:46,226 --> 00:29:49,222
You can't blame me.

563
00:29:49,307 --> 00:29:51,720
Does James even
know that you're here?

564
00:29:51,806 --> 00:29:53,253
You're hanging out
with a bunch of tweakers

565
00:29:53,339 --> 00:29:54,657
who are turning tricks
for spells.

566
00:29:54,754 --> 00:29:56,084
Are you kidding me?
These people wanna--

567
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,417
Stop slumming
because you're pissed

568
00:29:57,553 --> 00:29:59,332
that you lost
for once in your life.

569
00:30:02,499 --> 00:30:05,045
I'm sorry, but I mean it.

570
00:30:05,130 --> 00:30:06,578
You could really get hurt
doing this shit,

571
00:30:06,663 --> 00:30:09,709
and for what?

572
00:30:09,795 --> 00:30:13,124
Grow up.

573
00:30:13,243 --> 00:30:15,157
Do you love magic?

574
00:30:17,823 --> 00:30:19,820
Is it in your soul?

575
00:30:24,236 --> 00:30:27,233
Is it like the secret heart
of what you always were?

576
00:30:30,615 --> 00:30:33,445
Yeah.

577
00:30:33,564 --> 00:30:36,276
So you know how I feel.

578
00:31:09,043 --> 00:31:11,373
Get in.

579
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:21,999
Penny, how's your head?

580
00:31:22,084 --> 00:31:24,415
How you think?

581
00:31:26,949 --> 00:31:28,329
So, what's wrong with me?

582
00:31:28,414 --> 00:31:29,863
Nothing's wrong.

583
00:31:29,997 --> 00:31:32,161
I made the mistake of thinking
you were just psychic,

584
00:31:32,246 --> 00:31:35,359
but it...
it's more complicated.

585
00:31:35,495 --> 00:31:38,906
You are a Traveller.

586
00:31:39,024 --> 00:31:41,571
A what now?

587
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,020
The rarest

588
00:31:43,106 --> 00:31:44,819
and most difficult Discipline.

589
00:31:44,905 --> 00:31:46,818
Travellers can,
with a little bit of training,

590
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:48,734
go anywhere on Earth instantly

591
00:31:48,853 --> 00:31:50,316
just as you did.

592
00:31:50,401 --> 00:31:54,347
But you can, with a great
deal of training,

593
00:31:54,483 --> 00:31:57,979
actually move between worlds.

594
00:31:58,063 --> 00:32:00,177
- Go to other worlds?
- Yes.

595
00:32:00,263 --> 00:32:03,559
If the gift
does not kill you first.

596
00:32:03,677 --> 00:32:06,840
Great. Just fucking great.

597
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:10,004
Do you know why I'm here?

598
00:32:10,139 --> 00:32:11,504
To say this.

599
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:13,635
You've been a thin layer
of insouciance

600
00:32:13,721 --> 00:32:17,050
over an open pit of self-pity
your entire life.

601
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:18,965
This is not a joke.

602
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:20,665
You do not have the luxury
to mess around

603
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,330
now that this is
out of the bottle.

604
00:32:22,466 --> 00:32:24,329
You will study this.
You will master this.

605
00:32:24,415 --> 00:32:25,829
Do you understand?

606
00:32:25,914 --> 00:32:28,660
Ain't you a bucket of empathy,
blind man.

607
00:32:28,795 --> 00:32:31,459
Please say yes.

608
00:32:31,544 --> 00:32:34,989
I cannot see you nod.

609
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:37,038
Fine.

610
00:32:38,074 --> 00:32:40,070
Yes.

611
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,867
So, are we just gonna drive
all the way back to Brakebills?

612
00:32:44,985 --> 00:32:47,865
We're already there.

613
00:32:58,062 --> 00:33:00,691
Penny.

614
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:02,940
I've learned a great deal

615
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:04,688
about Travelling over the years.

616
00:33:04,807 --> 00:33:06,604
We'll start one-on-one tutorials

617
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:08,520
to help you get
a handle on your ability.

618
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:09,968
Yes,

619
00:33:10,104 --> 00:33:12,800
before you accidentally
transport yourself

620
00:33:12,885 --> 00:33:16,298
inside a volcano.

621
00:33:26,294 --> 00:33:28,458
She's right.

622
00:33:28,593 --> 00:33:29,790
We were best friends.

623
00:33:31,842 --> 00:33:33,455
- Should we help?
- No.

624
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:35,837
<i>Let me in, you assholes!</i>

625
00:33:35,954 --> 00:33:39,785
I don't know what happened.
I don't know how it got so bad.

626
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:41,783
You found out who you are

627
00:33:41,918 --> 00:33:44,498
and she found out who she's not.

628
00:33:44,617 --> 00:33:45,747
Life.

629
00:33:49,114 --> 00:33:51,944
Tell you what.

630
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:55,109
Let's not talk.

631
00:33:57,909 --> 00:33:59,773
Shit!

632
00:34:02,357 --> 00:34:05,102
How long were you to douchebags
gonna leave me out there?

633
00:34:05,238 --> 00:34:08,234
Oh, never mind that.

634
00:34:08,319 --> 00:34:11,315
Now you're with your people.

635
00:34:11,434 --> 00:34:13,980
Cheers to that.

636
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:16,646
Good God.

637
00:34:18,263 --> 00:34:21,842
Cheers.

638
00:34:25,182 --> 00:34:26,941
So, this Niffin box?

639
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,909
- This have a lid?
- There isn't one.

640
00:34:31,044 --> 00:34:32,290
The Niffin becomes
fused with the wood.

641
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:33,957
It's unable to escape.

642
00:34:34,075 --> 00:34:36,122
- How do you activate it?
- There's a short chant.

643
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,738
You just basically repeat
"I bind you"

644
00:34:37,822 --> 00:34:39,121
in Turkish and English.

645
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,702
That sounds a little easy.

646
00:34:40,788 --> 00:34:42,536
Well, that and the
month long incantation it took

647
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,233
to enchant the thing
in the first place.

648
00:34:44,369 --> 00:34:47,899
So, this is
the enchantment research?

649
00:34:48,034 --> 00:34:50,531
We're not gonna use the box.

650
00:34:50,615 --> 00:34:52,862
What?

651
00:34:52,948 --> 00:34:54,529
We're gonna bring Charlie back.

652
00:34:54,613 --> 00:34:57,226
Okay, Alice this is the point

653
00:34:57,312 --> 00:35:00,192
where I look at you
like you're nuts.

654
00:35:00,276 --> 00:35:02,056
I--okay, look.

655
00:35:02,192 --> 00:35:03,555
I've been doing some research,

656
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:06,437
um, on Niffins.

657
00:35:06,556 --> 00:35:07,720
Look, they're not even alive.

658
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:10,185
Th--they're...
something else.

659
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,885
Look, I can't explain it,

660
00:35:12,019 --> 00:35:13,883
but I know that he's out there.
He's somewhere.

661
00:35:13,985 --> 00:35:15,099
Is there anything
in the literature that says

662
00:35:15,217 --> 00:35:16,598
that going Niffin is reversible?

663
00:35:16,717 --> 00:35:18,380
Nothing says that it isn't.

664
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,379
Exactly.

665
00:35:20,514 --> 00:35:22,378
So I found this spell
that can transmutate

666
00:35:22,464 --> 00:35:25,877
certain meta-quantum energies
into matter...in theory.

667
00:35:26,011 --> 00:35:27,708
And I combined it with an
advanced transformation ritual--

668
00:35:27,843 --> 00:35:29,173
Alice, this is Major Arcana--

669
00:35:29,258 --> 00:35:30,540
What? Just because
you couldn't do it?

670
00:35:30,675 --> 00:35:32,005
Nobody could do it.

671
00:35:32,091 --> 00:35:33,204
You're making it up
as you go along.

672
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:35,003
Look, I--

673
00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:37,202
- You are an amazing magician--
- Don't patronize me.

674
00:35:37,288 --> 00:35:38,585
I'm not patronizing you.
I'm telling you that

675
00:35:38,704 --> 00:35:40,833
- this is not a good idea.
- What do you know?

676
00:35:40,919 --> 00:35:42,533
Hmm?

677
00:35:42,668 --> 00:35:43,831
You only learned
about magic, what?

678
00:35:43,917 --> 00:35:45,698
- Three months ago?
- Okay, sure.

679
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:47,530
I--but even I can tell
that this is crazy.

680
00:35:47,614 --> 00:35:49,328
I don't understand
why you can't see that.

681
00:35:49,413 --> 00:35:51,528
Fine. Stay behind.

682
00:35:51,662 --> 00:35:52,910
I'm here, and I'm only here,
to find out

683
00:35:53,028 --> 00:35:54,242
what happened to Charlie,

684
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:55,679
and now that I know
I can help him

685
00:35:55,743 --> 00:35:57,490
I'm going to.

686
00:36:15,265 --> 00:36:17,644
Thanks for coming so quick.

687
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:20,343
I was kinda surprised
you called.

688
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:22,509
Thought you disappeared again.

689
00:36:22,644 --> 00:36:24,474
You okay?

690
00:36:25,759 --> 00:36:28,339
You wanna talk about it?

691
00:36:28,425 --> 00:36:30,721
Please?

692
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,802
- Last call, Julia.
- I--

693
00:36:32,888 --> 00:36:36,217
I don't know
how to talk about it.

694
00:36:38,885 --> 00:36:42,081
I got involved with something.

695
00:36:43,498 --> 00:36:46,993
Made me wanna
give up everything.

696
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,126
Life, school...

697
00:36:49,211 --> 00:36:52,957
all of it.

698
00:36:53,043 --> 00:36:55,656
It got under my skin,

699
00:36:55,741 --> 00:36:57,704
and it--

700
00:36:57,823 --> 00:37:01,652
And?

701
00:37:01,737 --> 00:37:04,484
Jules, just tell me.

702
00:37:07,234 --> 00:37:10,197
It's Adderall.

703
00:37:10,315 --> 00:37:12,862
I started taking it

704
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,477
when I was applying
to grad school,

705
00:37:14,612 --> 00:37:17,942
and then I was taking
more and more.

706
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:21,690
I know I've been a bitch,

707
00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:24,971
but lately I've been
going to meetings.

708
00:37:26,806 --> 00:37:28,968
Wow.

709
00:37:35,133 --> 00:37:37,297
I--

710
00:37:37,383 --> 00:37:39,014
Can I--

711
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:41,345
I don't know, can I hug you?

712
00:37:41,464 --> 00:37:44,293
I wish you would.

713
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,674
It's okay, Jules.

714
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:51,288
I really love you, you know.

715
00:37:51,374 --> 00:37:53,587
I know.
I'm amazing.

716
00:38:21,823 --> 00:38:25,152
Okay, so, we're here, and...

717
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:27,818
Arrive at the place
of his transformation.

718
00:38:27,936 --> 00:38:31,815
Present yourself.

719
00:38:31,933 --> 00:38:33,763
There's a third step.

720
00:38:33,848 --> 00:38:36,927
What's the third step?

721
00:38:37,063 --> 00:38:40,925
I have to call in to him with
something personal between us,

722
00:38:41,011 --> 00:38:43,391
um...

723
00:38:43,476 --> 00:38:46,089
so Charlie used to sing to me
my favorite song

724
00:38:46,225 --> 00:38:47,756
when I was feeling bad

725
00:38:47,891 --> 00:38:49,671
which is kind of all the time.

726
00:38:55,469 --> 00:38:58,632
♪ Won't you come see about me ♪

727
00:38:58,751 --> 00:39:00,914
Is that "The Breakfast Club"?

728
00:39:01,049 --> 00:39:03,746
♪ I'll be alone dancing ♪

729
00:39:03,881 --> 00:39:06,077
♪ You know it, baby ♪

730
00:39:06,213 --> 00:39:10,242
♪ Tell me your troubles
and doubts ♪

731
00:39:10,328 --> 00:39:15,538
♪ Giving me everything
inside and out ♪

732
00:39:15,624 --> 00:39:20,369
♪ Don't you forget about me ♪

733
00:39:20,454 --> 00:39:23,567
♪ Don't, don't, don't, don't ♪

734
00:39:23,702 --> 00:39:26,482
Alice, look.

735
00:39:32,897 --> 00:39:38,609
Charlie, Charlie?

736
00:39:47,189 --> 00:39:49,518
- Charlie, is that you?
- Alice.

737
00:39:49,604 --> 00:39:53,382
Oh, my God, Charlie,
I can't believe it's you.

738
00:39:53,517 --> 00:39:58,547
I missed you so much.
I don't even know what to say.

739
00:39:58,682 --> 00:40:01,877
Charlie, what are you doing?

740
00:40:01,963 --> 00:40:02,876
Charlie, you're hurting me.

741
00:40:02,962 --> 00:40:04,842
Charlie, that hurts.

742
00:40:08,009 --> 00:40:09,873
You're just confused,
Charlie, it's me.

743
00:40:12,924 --> 00:40:15,869
Charlie--Charlie,
why are you doing this?

744
00:40:16,005 --> 00:40:17,702
Why?

745
00:40:17,837 --> 00:40:19,033
Alice, I don't think--
I don't think that we should--

746
00:40:19,169 --> 00:40:20,033
I know you're in there, Charlie.

747
00:40:20,169 --> 00:40:21,583
- I know it's you.
- Alice!

748
00:40:21,702 --> 00:40:24,365
Hah!

749
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:28,412
Charlie, stop!
I can help you.

750
00:40:37,608 --> 00:40:39,238
Alice, stop!

751
00:40:48,685 --> 00:40:50,398
Alice, he's gonna kill us.
It's not gonna work.

752
00:40:50,517 --> 00:40:52,148
- You have to stop.
- Shut up, I can do this.

753
00:40:52,233 --> 00:40:53,730
Alice, it's not Charlie.

754
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,561
Oh, shit.
Shit.

755
00:41:00,395 --> 00:41:04,473
<i>Emrediyorum!</i>

756
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:09,054
Alice, stop!
You're gonna kill yourself.

757
00:41:09,173 --> 00:41:10,836
You are bound and held fast.

758
00:41:10,972 --> 00:41:12,835
<i>Seni baglamak!</i>

759
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,051
No!
No!

760
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:16,883
I bind you!
<i>Seni baglamak.</i>

761
00:41:17,001 --> 00:41:18,049
- No!
- I bind you!

762
00:41:18,168 --> 00:41:20,381
<i>Seni baglamak.</i>

763
00:41:28,411 --> 00:41:32,707
You--you brought the box.

764
00:41:32,824 --> 00:41:36,154
Yeah.

765
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:38,037
Alice, he was gonna kill you.

766
00:41:38,156 --> 00:41:41,701
Why did you think
you had to save me?

767
00:41:41,819 --> 00:41:44,449
Fuck you, Quentin.

768
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:46,982
You had no idea
what I was doing.

769
00:41:47,067 --> 00:41:50,646
I was so close,
and now he's gone.

770
00:42:14,517 --> 00:42:16,297
Where you going, kitty cat?

771
00:42:16,432 --> 00:42:18,629
I'm done here.
For good.

772
00:42:18,764 --> 00:42:20,428
You should be happy.
Less competition.

773
00:42:20,514 --> 00:42:22,927
Alice.

774
00:42:23,012 --> 00:42:24,958
I like competition.
