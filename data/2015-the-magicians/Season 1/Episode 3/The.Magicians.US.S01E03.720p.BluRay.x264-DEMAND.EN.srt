The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,606
Have you ever
heard of Brakebills?

<i>MARINA: NO- JULIA: It's
like this secret Yale,</i>

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,250
<i>and you have to be able
to do magic to even get in.</i>

5
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,443
MARINA: Well, <i>I</i> can do magic-
JULIA: Yeah, so can I-

6
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,681
<i>QUENTIN: Sorry,
I just got your e-mail.</i>

7
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:12,761
<i>JAMES: My fifth e-mail.</i>

8
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,205
<i>QUENTIN: Just tell me
what you meant by...</i>

9
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,931
<i>JAMES: I mean not herself.
I mean barely talks to me.</i>

10
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,287
<i>JAMES: She looks like a goddamn ghost.
She's not Julia.</i>

11
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,771
I need you to tell them
they were wrong about me.

12
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,126
Tell them to test me again.

13
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,361
QUENTIN: I'm sorry,
but they would know.

14
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,851
It's really okay
if this is not your thing.

15
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,962
JULIA: So you were...
Top bitch in New York.

16
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,486
lam willing to teach the right
people everything I know.

17
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,891
Who are we trying to contact?
ALICE: Charlie.

18
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,531
And who's Charlie?
My brother. He died.

19
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,602
<i>QUENTIN: Jesus, we could not have
screwed up that spell worse,</i>

20
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,721
<i>and we can't take it back.</i>

21
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,325
<i>PETE: Now that you're in,
it's time to learn some magic.</i>

22
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,531
Just don't get too excited.

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,011
Start slow.
(SCOFFS)

24
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,568
Yeah, I don't really do slow.

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,846
Hmm.

26
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,047
DEAN: <i>Being a Magician
has always been,</i>

27
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,605
<i>in part,</i>

28
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,169
<i>about accruing power.</i>

29
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,088
DEAN: Power over yourself,

30
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,170
the elements.

31
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,368
Power over the future.
(WHISPERS) He's back.

32
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,444
DEAN: The very world
that exists around you.

33
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,931
(WHISPERING) He said
he had an announcement.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,571
But power,
as you all know,

35
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,850
does not come cheaply.

36
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,205
<i>DEAN: There are reasons</i>

37
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,370
<i>we teach this curriculum</i>

38
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,204
<i>precisely the way that we do.</i>

39
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,571
<i>Skipping around,</i>

40
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,603
<i>focusing on
all the wrong things,</i>

41
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,960
<i>lack of guidance.</i>

42
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,168
<i>These are all
extremely dangerous.</i>

43
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,884
<i>There are certain energies,
certain spells,</i>

44
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,202
<i>which are far too powerful
for one Magician alone.</i>

45
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,882
If you lose control,
they will turn against you.

46
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,570
They will kill you.
They will consume you.

47
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,571
Change you

48
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,889
into something else.

49
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,250
Now that I have
your attention,

50
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,400
we test to discern
your discipline.

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,843
Your area of concentration.

52
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,605
It is what you are,
and with the right guidance,

53
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,284
you may safely rise

54
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,289
to unknowable heights.

55
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,721
You will find your scheduled
times and invitations

56
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,086
inside your bags.

57
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,050
Hey, babe, it's me. Um,
just got your message.

58
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,522
I'm so sorry, I got stuck.
Be there as soon as I can.

59
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,280
Love you.

60
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,122
Never gets old, does it?

61
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,086
Having a secret.

62
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,965
You have magic.

63
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,245
They don't.

64
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,564
Better than money.

65
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,290
Better than sex.

66
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,369
Well,I guess
that one depends.

67
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,727
James is cool, really.
He barely notices.

68
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,529
We've both been
so busy with school.

69
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,721
Look,

70
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,650
we all juggle.

71
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,970
You're kicking ass.

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,651
Just don't forget to
manage your shit.

73
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,169
Don't want boyfriend getting worried,
following you to the safe house door.

74
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,049
Got it covered, okay?

75
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,845
I know you do.

76
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,411
Just saying.

77
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,927
DEAN: Yes,
these are promising.

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,128
I get a strong sense
of blues

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,206
and pinks.

80
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,044
Is that Alice Quinn?

81
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,409
Alice, please sit,
if there's a seat.

82
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,925
Bit of a transition.

83
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,082
I find that I prefer
an office that I can reach

84
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,363
without falling down three
flights of steps that l cannot see.

85
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,124
This'll be quick, Alice.

86
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,646
Show Professor March
what you can do.

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,684
Like I said, I used to do
a lot of coin and card tricks,

88
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,048
and I guess sometimes I would
actually use real magic.

89
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,929
Predictions could mean
psychic.

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,810
Vanishing could mean
illusions or physical magic.

91
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,450
Hmm. Curious.

92
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,806
What? What's curious?

93
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,769
Now, try holding these.

94
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,606
Think the alphabet in Greek.

95
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,126
No.

96
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,641
Just lovely, Miss Quinn.

97
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,602
So clean. Very advanced.

98
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,966
Physical magic.
Hmm.

99
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,405
MARCH: Definitely.

100
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,411
Just stare at it.

101
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,209
Well, you're not an herbalist.

102
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,483
ALICE: Undetermined?
Can they do that?

103
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,163
Yeah, Sunderland
said it happens,

104
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,642
so I guess they'll
try again next year.

Phosphoromancy.

109
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,605

Holy shit!

111
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,165
There are much cooler areas.

112
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,811
Are you kidding me?
You have light bending power.

113
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,370

Literally, they have
extra space.

117
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,565
Well, at least they have that allegedly
mind-blowing signature cocktail.

ALICE: Just keep walking.

179
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,806
Okay.)'-

180
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,124
Finally.

181
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,529
QUENTIN: Guess it's
Woof Fountain.

182
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,049
ALICE: Ugh!
I never liked this thing.

183
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,966
Eliot says it's
enchanted as shit.

184
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:12,447
Supposedly it's bottomless, so
you know the psychics love it.

185
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,045
Suicide fountain.

186
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,811
You don't think
your brother...

187
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,041
No.

188
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,523
He wasn't that kind of guy.

189
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,123
He was the kind of guy who always wanted
to fix things for everyone around him.

190
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,284
He was really, really good.

191
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,404
You know that spell I did
on the first day of class?

192
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,209
With the Glass Horse?

193
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,210
He taught me that.

194
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,081
(SIGHS)

195
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,969
Come on, let's go.
Nothing's happening.

196
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,689
The whole thing
is fucking pointless.

197
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,000
Psychic?

198
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,964
I wanna punch
Sunderland in the throat.

199
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,407
You know, as a psychic, you'd think
you'd have seen all this coming.

200
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,084
Woman, please. Ahh!
(LAUGHS)

201
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,086
PENNY: Hold On.

202
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,891
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

203
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,365
Are we actually
doing this again?

204
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,683
Do you know how to close your mind?
'Cause I will show you right now.

205
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,330
I thought I was.
Eliot gave me a...

206
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,845
Seriously, man?

207
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,081
Taylor Swift?

208
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,804
l am not singing
Taylor Swift in my head.

209
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,047
(SIGHS)

210
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,566
(SOFTLY) Okay,
I'll work on it.

211
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,723
JAMES: So, it's got lots
of space. Lots of light.

212
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,643
It looks really great.

213
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,804
I'm sorry, I guess I thought you were still
considering Yale for the fall with me.

214
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,927
What?

215
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,648
Okay, can we just
talk about this now?

216
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,881
Where is your head?

217
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,849
Why do I feel like
I'm talking to myself?

218
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,051
I've just been
busy with class...

219
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,406
Are you seeing someone else?

220
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,244
No! Why would you ask that?

221
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,970
Because you're different.

222
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,407
You stand me up.
You don't answer your phone.

223
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,960
I'm just... I'm starting
to feel like the asshole.

224
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,525
You're not.

225
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,445
Hey...

226
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,529
I love you.

227
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,490
You know that.

228
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,764
Look, I know I've been
moody lately, but...

229
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,490
I feel a lot better.

230
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,242
James, come on.

231
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,441
Hey.

232
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,051
Mmm.

233
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,291
Okay, go on. Someone killed
themselves in the fountain?

234
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,442
Yeah, try 15 students
and one dean.

235
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,126
Van Pelt.
Fountain's named after him.

236
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,327
It does feel a little bit off
here though, doesn't it?

237
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,809
Brief announcement.

238
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,089
The Van Pelt fountain is
temporarily off limits.

239
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,285
There's been an incursion.

240
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,211
We believe it's a garden
variety haunting.

241
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,484
Redrawing the wards
may have released it

242
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,006
much like a mouse caught
in the walls of a building.

243
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,448
No one was seriously hurt.

244
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,083
Both students involved are
recuperating in the infirmary.

245
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,401
Regardless,

246
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,770
stay away
until we lock it down.

247
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,849
I mean, what if
it was Charlie?

248
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,729
I don't know. Maybe.

249
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,487
ALICE: If not, it's a
pretty big coincidence.

250
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,491
But if it was Charlie, don't you think
that he would have reached out to you,

251
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,085
directly?

252
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,204
Maybe he just did.

253
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,369
ALICE:
It's definitely Charlie.

254
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,566
Okay.

255
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,407
So, why would he try and
drown a bunch of psychics?

256
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,767
MARGO: Uh...
Have you met them?

257
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,971
Are you two talking about
what happened at Woof?

258
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,681
That was a private
conversation. You know.

259
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,205
Well... Meow!

260
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,131
What was that?

261
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,725
(WHISPERS) I just...
I don't trust her.

262
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,602
Okay, look. I just...

263
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,246
I think trying to drown people
seems a little violent.

264
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,084
He may not have even
known what he was doing.

265
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,168
I mean, spirits,
they can get confused.

266
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:56,164
Okay, then how do we talk to him
without him trying to drown us?

267
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,165
I don't know.

268
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,929
But first thing's first.
I found a spell...

269
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,843
Well, five actually, but they
all have their own down side.

270
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,888
Like, we don't know how
Charlie died exactly

271
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,246
and the moon is in
the wrong spot right now.

272
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,401
Look, I know you don't
trust her,

273
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,608
but maybe Margo could...
Or there's a Maori spell.

274
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,200
I'd have to cut off a finger,
but they might be preferable.

275
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,844
Quentin, I need your help.
Highest priority.

276
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,722
Let's go.
Okay.

277
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,122
Hey, look, you said it yourself,
you don't have all the facts,

278
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,645
so maybe you don't
need a spell.

279
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,601
Maybe you need information, and
Margo's discipline is gossip, so...

280
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,251
What do you need?

281
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,767
(CLATTERING)

282
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,763
ELIOT: We have a real problem.

283
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,130
Is it in the box?

284
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,163
Professor Sunderland
came looking for a book

285
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,402
from the Physical
Cottage Library,

286
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,084
and it's missing.

287
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,321
I diverted her attention,
but...

288
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,606
What does that have to do
with the box?

289
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,207
Books at Brakebills, Quentin,
are not just books.

290
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,489
One goes missing, it's not just a
library fine we're talking about here.

291
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,722
What're we talking about?
We're talking about...

292
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,211
We have

293
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,044
occasional parties.

294
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,203
During one, someone took a book,
and if we don't find that book

295
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,567
the faculty are going to take
a harder look at our parties,

296
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,449
and that cannot happen,
Quentin.

297
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,885
(CLATTERING)

298
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,008
So you gonna tell me
what's in the box, or...

299
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,326
Hmm...

300
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,164
(EXCLAIMS)
What the hell is that?

301
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,810
The missing book
is Volume One.

302
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,086
That...

303
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,450
...is Volume Two.

304
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,651
(INHALES SHARPLY)

305
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,609
She's going to lead us
to her mate.

306
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,761
Oh.

307
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,200
(CHANTING)

308
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,165
(CHANTING)
(CLATTERS)

309
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,561
Shit.

310
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,963
Uh... Let me try it again.

311
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,486
Should be easy.
You're distracted.

312
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,849
I know, I just... I have
a lot going on.

313
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,968
No, you don't. You have this spell.
That's it.

314
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,168
So how do you manage it all?

315
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,283
Juggling magic and your life?

316
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,281
I don't understand
the question.

317
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,324
I'm not judging you.

318
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,643
I started out like you
and you have a good life.

319
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,291
Boyfriend.

320
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,968
Probably think he keeps
you centered.

321
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,041
Kind of.

322
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:28,011
Or, you know, you're keeping him
around in case you fail here

323
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,969
and need to fall back.

324
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,965
All I know, you have to
mean it for magic to work.

325
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,767
Something clicks
when you're all-in,

326
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,968
and the real big stuff,

327
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,244
you can't do it

328
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,608
till you're doing it
without a net.

329
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,046
I...

330
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,771
I need your help.

331
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,320
That wasn't so hard,
was it?

332
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,567
Look, I'm just trying to find out
what happened to my brother.

333
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,041
He was a student here
five years ago.

334
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,246
Okay.)'-

335
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,969
He was a physical kid.

336
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,089
His name was Charlie,

337
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,165
and then he died.

338
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,447
Know what?
I did hear about that.

339
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,890
At Woof, right?

340
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,681
Five, six years back?

341
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,410
It's all making sense now.

342
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,562
What is?
You.

343
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,245
The awkward thing.

344
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,489
The anger underneath
the ineffable air of tragedy

345
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,568
you wear like a perfume.

346
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:52,961
Look, can you just tell me what
you know about Charlie? Please?

347
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,487
Loathe as I am to admit it, I
don't actually know anything.

348
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,926
Although, there was a girl
from Charlie's year who might.

349
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,770
Emily Greenstreet.

350
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,685
Who was she?

351
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,000
Just a girl.

352
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,811
When he died,

00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,324
Oh, my God, Charlie,
I can't believe it's you.

709
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,363
I missed you so much. I don't
even know what to say.

710
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,680
(LAUGHS)

711
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,484
Charlie, what are you doing?

712
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,883
Charlie, you're hurting me.
Charlie, that hurts.

713
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,928
(CACKLING)

714
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,041
You're just confused,
Charlie, it's me.

715
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,281
(SHRIEKS)

716
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,724
Charlie, why are you
doing this?

717
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,246
Why?

718
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,970
Alice, I don't think... I
don't think that we should...

719
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,724
ALICE: I know you're in there, Charlie.
I know it's you.

720
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,847
Alice!

721
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,127
Ha!
(GASPS)

722
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,806
ALICE: Charlie, stop! I can help you.
(CHOKING)

723
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,609
(ALICE CHANTING)

724
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,523
(CONTINUES CHANTING)

725
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,364
Alice, stop!

726
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,050
(RESUMES CHANTING)

727
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,451
(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

728
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,284
QUENTIN: Alice, he's gonna kill us.
It's not gonna work.

729
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,010
QUENTIN: You have to stop.
Shut up, I can do this.

730
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,650
Alice, it's not Charlie.

731
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,086
(QUENTIN GRUNTS)

732
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,051
(CHANTING)

733
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,769
You are bound and held fast.

734
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,766
(CHANTING)

735
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,966
No!

736
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,320
I bind you!

737
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,606
(CHANTING)

738
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,011
No!
I bind you!

00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,720
(CHANTING)

740
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,400
(GRUNTS)

741
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,800
(STAMMERING)
You brought the box.

742
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,886
Yeah.

743
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,124
Alice, he was gonna
kill you.

744
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,567
Why did you think
you had to save me?

745
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,410
Fuck you, Quentin.

746
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,927
You had no idea
what I was doing.

747
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:55,721
I was so close,
and now he's gone.

748
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,086
(PANTING)

749
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,690
Where you going, kitty cat?

750
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,690
I'm done here. For good.

751
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,808
You should be happy.
Less competition.

752
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,041
Alice.

753
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,365
I like competition.
