ALICE: <i>Previously
on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:03,680
Have you ever
heard of Brakebills?

3
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:05,544
MARINA: <i>No.</i> JULIA:
<i>It's like this secret Yale,</i>

4
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:07,317
<i>and you have to be able
to do magic to even get in.</i>

5
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:10,436
MARINA: <i>Well, I can do
magic.</i> JULIA: <i>Yeah, so can I.</i>

6
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:11,721
QUENTIN: <i>Sorry, I
just got your e-mail.</i>

7
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:12,769
JAMES: <i>My fifth e-mail.</i>

8
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,224
QUENTIN: <i>Just tell
me what you meant by...</i>

9
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:16,945
JAMES: <i>I mean not herself.
I mean barely talks to me.</i>

10
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,282
JAMES: <i>She looks like a
goddamn ghost. She's not Julia.</i>

11
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:20,830
I need you to tell them
they were wrong about me.

12
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,117
Tell them to test me again.

13
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:23,399
QUENTIN: I'm sorry,
but they would know.

14
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:24,934
It's really okay if
this is not your thing.

15
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,950
JULIA: So you were...
Top bitch in New York.

16
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,496
I am willing to teach the
right people everything I know.

17
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:30,940
Who are we trying to
contact? ALICE: Charlie.

18
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:33,524
And who's Charlie?
My brother. He died.

19
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,678
QUENTIN: <i>Jesus, we could not
have screwed up that spell worse,</i>

20
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:36,742
<i>and we can't take it back.</i>

21
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:03,290
PETE: <i>Now that you're in,
it's time to learn some magic.</i>

22
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:06,532
Just don't get too excited.

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,966
Start slow. (SCOFFS)

24
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:10,571
Yeah, I don't really do slow.

25
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:12,799
Hmm.

26
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:24,044
DEAN: <i>Being a Magician
has always been,</i>

27
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,583
<i>in part,</i>

28
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:29,146
<i>about accruing power.</i>

29
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:32,092
DEAN: Power over yourself,

30
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:34,161
the elements.

31
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:36,354
Power over the future.
(WHISPERS) He's back.

32
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,457
DEAN: The very world
that exists around you.

33
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:40,977
(WHISPERING) He said
he had an announcement.

34
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:43,561
But power, as you all know,

35
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,864
does not come cheaply.

36
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:49,165
DEAN: <i>There are reasons</i>

37
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:51,367
<i>we teach this curriculum</i>

38
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,175
<i>precisely the way that we do.</i>

39
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:55,579
<i>Skipping around,</i>

40
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,617
<i>focusing on all
the wrong things,</i>

41
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:58,982
<i>lack of guidance.</i>

42
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,146
<i>These are all
extremely dangerous.</i>

43
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:04,881
<i>There are certain
energies, certain spells,</i>

44
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:09,220
<i>which are far too powerful
for one Magician alone.</i>

45
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:13,856
If you lose control,
they will turn against you.

46
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,537
They will kill you.
They will consume you.

47
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:19,537
Change you

48
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,904
into something else.

49
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:44,364
Now that I have your attention,

50
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,390
we test to discern
your discipline.

51
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,833
Your area of concentration.

52
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:52,600
It is what you are, and
with the right guidance,

53
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,301
you may safely rise

54
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:56,240
to unknowable heights.

55
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,745
You will find your scheduled
times and invitations

56
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:01,076
inside your bags.

57
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:13,050
Hey, babe, it's me. Um,
just got your message.

58
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:16,528
I'm so sorry, I got stuck.
Be there as soon as I can.

59
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,293
Love you.

60
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,107
Never gets old, does it?

61
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,071
Having a secret.

62
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:30,968
You have magic.

63
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,244
They don't.

64
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,543
Better than money.

65
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,243
Better than sex.

66
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,351
Well, I guess that one depends.

67
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,720
James is cool, really.
He barely notices.

68
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,520
We've both been
so busy with school.

69
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:48,728
Look,

70
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,654
we all juggle.

71
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:53,934
You're kicking ass.

72
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,630
Just don't forget to
manage your shit.

73
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:01,166
Don't want boyfriend getting worried,
following you to the safe house door.

74
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,039
Got it covered, okay?

75
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:05,802
I know you do.

76
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,412
Just saying.

77
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:10,914
DEAN: Yes, these are promising.

78
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,112
I get a strong sense of blues

79
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,216
and pinks.

80
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,053
Is that Alice Quinn?

81
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,385
Alice, please sit,
if there's a seat.

82
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:22,929
Bit of a transition.

83
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,124
I find that I prefer an
office that I can reach

84
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:28,362
without falling down three
flights of steps that I cannot see.

85
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,097
This'll be quick, Alice.

86
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,639
Show Professor
March what you can do.

87
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:38,755
Like I said, I used to do a
lot of coin and card tricks,

88
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:42,045
and I guess sometimes I
would actually use real magic.

89
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,913
Predictions could mean psychic.

90
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:46,818
Vanishing could mean
illusions or physical magic.

91
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,480
Hmm. Curious.

92
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:49,784
What? What's curious?

93
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:51,757
Now, try holding these.

94
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:54,584
Think the alphabet in Greek.

95
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:57,124
No.

96
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:59,629
Just lovely, Miss Quinn.

97
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,594
So clean. Very advanced.

98
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:03,967
Physical magic. Hmm.

99
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,403
MARCH: Definitely.

100
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,382
Just stare at it.

101
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,186
Well, you're not an herbalist.

102
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,492
ALICE: Undetermined?
Can they do that?

103
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:29,196
Yeah, Sunderland
said it happens,

104
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:32,630
so I guess they'll
try again next year.

105
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:36,301

108
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:41,998
Phosphoromancy.

109
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,578
I bend light.

110
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,678
Holy shit!

111
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,147
There are much cooler areas.

112
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:52,812
Are you kidding me? You
have light bending power.

113
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,354
I'm a nothing-mancer.

114
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:57,186
I'm a squat-mancer.

115
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:59,869
Well, if you're undetermined, then
why are you assigned to the Cottage?

116
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:02,385
Literally, they
have extra space.

117
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:07,558
Well, at least they have that allegedly
mind-blowing signature cocktail.

118
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,502
Can't be all bad.

we have to figure out how.

124
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,911
Right.

That spell we did
to reach my brother.

153
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:38,214
I mean, I went over
it, like, a million times.

say that like you

the truth, that's all.

You know, the spell
we did was, like...

00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,668
I don't know, it was
like a phone call.

160
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:57,932
We made contact,
but he didn't pick up,

161
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,905
so then The Beast picked up.

162
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:02,602
But that still leaves the
question, "Where's Charlie?"

163

that question, somebody died.

179
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:54,786
Okay.

180
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,121
Finally.

181
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,528
QUENTIN: Guess
it's Woof Fountain.

182
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,995
ALICE: Ugh! I
never liked this thing.

183
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:06,939
Eliot says it's
enchanted as shit.

184
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:12,472
Supposedly it's bottomless,
so you know the psychics love it.

185
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,036
Suicide fountain.

186
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:15,780
You don't think your brother...

187
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,039
No.

188
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,518
He wasn't that kind of guy.

189
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:24,123
He was the kind of guy who always wanted
to fix things for everyone around him.

190
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,285
He was really, really good.

191
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,439
You know that spell I did
on the first day of class?

192
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,193
With the Glass Horse?

193
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:34,194
He taught me that.

194
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,073
(SIGHS)

195
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,946
Come on, let's go.
Nothing's happening.

196
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:13,701
The whole thing
is fucking pointless.

197
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:15,002
Psychic?

198
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,972
I wanna punch
Sunderland in the throat.

199
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,455
You know, as a psychic, you'd
think you'd have seen all this coming.

200
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,107
Woman, please. Ahh! (LAUGHS)

201
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,045
PENNY: Hold on.

202
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:29,922
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

203
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,355
Are we actually
doing this again?

204
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:34,690
Do you know how to close your
mind? 'Cause I will show you right now.

205
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,320
I thought I was.
Eliot gave me a...

206
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:37,830
Seriously, man?

207
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,058
Taylor Swift?

208
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,769
I am not singing
Taylor Swift in my head.

209
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,030
(SIGHS)

210
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:50,542
(SOFTLY) Okay, I'll work on it.

211
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,717
JAMES: So, it's got lots
of space. Lots of light.

212
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:03,654
It looks really great.

213
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:09,826
I'm sorry, I guess I thought you were still
considering Yale for the fall with me.

214
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:10,920
What?

215
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:14,664
Okay, can we just
talk about this now?

216
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,861
Where is your head?

217
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:17,836
Why do I feel like
I'm talking to myself?

218
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,030
I've just been
busy with class...

219
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,405
Are you seeing someone else?

220
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,239
No! Why would you ask that?

221
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,972
Because you're different.

222
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:28,446
You stand me up. You
don't answer your phone.

223
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,949
I'm just... I'm starting
to feel like the asshole.

224
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,482
You're not.

225
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:36,422
Hey...

226
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,520
I love you.

227
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,452
You know that.

228
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:45,799
Look, I know I've been
moody lately, but...

229
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,458
I feel a lot better.

230
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:51,227
James, come on.

231
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:55,433
Hey.

232
00:12:57,744 --> 00:12:59,042
Mmm.

233
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,277
Okay, go on. Someone killed
themselves in the fountain?

234
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,443
Yeah, try 15 students
and one dean.

235
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:08,113
Van Pelt. Fountain's
named after him.

236
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:12,325
It does feel a little bit off
here though, doesn't it?

237
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,828
Brief announcement.

238
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:22,096
The Van Pelt fountain
is temporarily off limits.

239
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:24,269
There's been an incursion.

240
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:29,167
We believe it's a
garden variety haunting.

241
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:34,479
Redrawing the wards
may have released it

242
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:36,982
much like a mouse caught
in the walls of a building.

243
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,444
No one was seriously hurt.

244
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:44,085
Both students involved are
recuperating in the infirmary.

245
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:46,419
Regardless,

246
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,758
stay away until we lock it down.

247
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,829
I mean, what if it was Charlie?

248
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,698
I don't know. Maybe.

249
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:58,468
ALICE: If not, it's a
pretty big coincidence.

250
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:02,518
But if it was Charlie, don't you think
that he would have reached out to you,

251
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:04,101
directly?

252
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,174
Maybe he just did.

253
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:16,352
ALICE: It's definitely Charlie.

254
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:18,550
Okay.

255
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:24,428
So, why would he try and
drown a bunch of psychics?

256
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:26,728
MARGO: Uh... Have you met them?

257
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,962
Are you two talking about
what happened at Woof?

258
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:33,665
That was a private
conversation. You know.

259
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,208
Well... Meow!

260
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,145
What was that?

261
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,734
(WHISPERS) I
just... I don't trust her.

262
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:45,576
Okay, look. I just...

263
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:49,212
I think trying to drown
people seems a little violent.

264
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,120
He may not have even
known what he was doing.

265
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,159
I mean, spirits, they
can get confused.

266
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,162
Okay, then how do we talk to
him without him trying to drown us?

267
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:59,129
I don't know.

268
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,934
But first thing's
first. I found a spell...

269
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,880
Well, five actually, but they
all have their own down side.

270
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,873
Like, we don't know
how Charlie died exactly

271
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:08,317
and the moon is in the
wrong spot right now.

272
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:09,451
Look, I know you
don't trust her,

273
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:11,637
but maybe Margo could...
Or there's a Maori spell.

274
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:14,203
I'd have to cut off a finger,
but they might be preferable.

275
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:18,818
Quentin, I need your
help. Highest priority.

276
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:21,711
Let's go. Okay.

277
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:25,156
Hey, look, you said it yourself,
you don't have all the facts,

278
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:26,658
so maybe you don't need a spell.

279
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:31,596
Maybe you need information, and
Margo's discipline is gossip, so...

280
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,230
What do you need?

281
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,799
(CLATTERING)

282
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,775
ELIOT: We have a real problem.

283
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:46,105
Is it in the box?

284
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,181
Professor Sunderland
came looking for a book

285
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,410
from the Physical
Cottage Library,

286
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,077
and it's missing.

287
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:54,396
I diverted her attention, but...

288
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,631
What does that have
to do with the box?

289
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:59,217
Books at Brakebills,
Quentin, are not just books.

290
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:02,456
One goes missing, it's not just a
library fine we're talking about here.

291
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,724
What're we talking about?
We're talking about...

292
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:06,196
We have

293
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,063
occasional parties.

294
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:12,196
During one, someone took a
book, and if we don't find that book

295
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,591
the faculty are going to take
a harder look at our parties,

296
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,438
and that cannot happen, Quentin.

297
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:17,875
(CLATTERING)

298
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,970
So you gonna tell me
what's in the box, or...

299
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,312
Hmm...

300
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:28,149
(EXCLAIMS) What
the hell is that?

301
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:29,780
The missing book is Volume One.

302
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:31,051
That...

303
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,453
is Volume Two.

304
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,625
(INHALES SHARPLY)

305
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,561
She's going to
lead us to her mate.

306
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:40,732
Oh.

307
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:43,197
(CHANTING)

308
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,164
(CHANTING) (CLATTERS)

309
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:49,541
Shit.

310
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,974
Uh... Let me try it again.

311
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:54,479
Should be easy.
You're distracted.

312
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:56,847
I know, I just... I
have a lot going on.

313
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,976
No, you don't. You
have this spell. That's it.

314
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,149
So how do you manage it all?

315
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:08,286
Juggling magic and your life?

316
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:11,261
I don't understand the question.

317
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:14,327
I'm not judging you.

318
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,632
I started out like you
and you have a good life.

319
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:19,269
Boyfriend.

320
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,933
Probably think he
keeps you centered.

321
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,042
Kind of.

322
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:28,013
Or, you know, you're keeping
him around in case you fail here

323
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,946
and need to fall back.

324
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,945
All I know, you have to
mean it for magic to work.

325
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:38,783
Something clicks
when you're all-in,

326
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:40,952
and the real big stuff,

327
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,220
you can't do it

328
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,589
till you're doing
it without a net.

329
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:03,746
I need your help.

330
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,342
That wasn't so hard, was it?

331
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:12,548
Look, I'm just trying to find out
what happened to my brother.

332
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,060
He was a student
here five years ago.

333
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,220
Okay.

334
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,965
He was a physical kid.

335
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,066
His name was Charlie,

336
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,203
and then he died.

337
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,468
Know what? I did
hear about that.

338
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:31,911
At Woof, right?

339
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,744
Five, six years back?

340
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,443
It's all making sense now.

341
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:39,610
What is? You.

342
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:41,277
The awkward thing.

343
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,549
The anger underneath
the ineffable air of tragedy

344
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,559
you wear like a perfume.

345
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:53,026
Look, can you just tell me what
you know about Charlie? Please?

346
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:56,501
Loathe as I am to admit it, I
don't actually know anything.

347
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:01,971
Although, there was a girl
from Charlie's year who might.

348
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,804
Emily Greenstreet.

349
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:06,744
Who was she?

350
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,007
Just a girl.

351
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,875
When he died,
apparently she took it hard.

352
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:14,387
Dropped out. Gave up
magic. The full muggle.

353
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,251

00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:02,662
(LAUGHS)

711
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:05,429
Charlie, what are you doing?

712
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:09,833
Charlie, you're hurting
me. Charlie, that hurts.

713
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:11,877
(CACKLING)

714
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:15,009
You're just confused,
Charlie, it's me.

715
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,240
(SHRIEKS)

716
00:40:17,682 --> 00:40:20,675
Charlie, why are you doing this?

717
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:22,248
Why?

718
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,998
Alice, I don't think... I
don't think that we should...

719
00:40:24,022 --> 00:40:25,733
ALICE: I know you're in
there, Charlie. I know it's you.

720
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:26,816
Alice!

721
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:29,122
Ha! (GASPS)

722
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:31,753
ALICE: Charlie, stop! I
can help you. (CHOKING)

723
00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:35,561
(ALICE CHANTING)

724
00:40:37,669 --> 00:40:39,501
(CONTINUES CHANTING)

725
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,302
Alice, stop!

726
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:52,009
(RESUMES CHANTING)

727
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:53,415
(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

728
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:55,296
QUENTIN: Alice, he's gonna
kill us. It's not gonna work.

729
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,031
QUENTIN: You have to
stop. Shut up, I can do this.

730
00:40:57,055 --> 00:40:58,580
Alice, it's not Charlie.

731
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:01,051
(QUENTIN GRUNTS)

732
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:06,023
(CHANTING)

733
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:15,735
You are bound and held fast.

734
00:41:16,441 --> 00:41:17,739
(CHANTING)

735
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:18,936
No!

736
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,308
I bind you!

737
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:21,573
(CHANTING)

738
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:22,944
No! I bind you!

740
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:32,385
(GRUNTS)

741
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:35,760
(STAMMERING)
You brought the box.

742
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:38,822
Yeah.

743
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,096
Alice, he was gonna kill you.

744
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,500
Why did you think
you had to save me?

745
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:48,332
Fuck you, Quentin.

746
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:51,906
You had no idea
what I was doing.

747
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:55,706
I was so close,
and now he's gone.

748
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,043
(PANTING)

749
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:21,632
Where you going, kitty cat?

750
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:23,641
I'm done here. For good.

751
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,768
You should be happy.
Less competition.

752
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:27,004
Alice.

753
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,314
I like competition.
