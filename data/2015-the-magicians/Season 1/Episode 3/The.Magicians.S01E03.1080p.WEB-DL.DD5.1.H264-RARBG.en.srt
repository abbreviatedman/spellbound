00:00:01,002 --> 00:00:02,351
<i>Previously on The Magicians</i>

2
00:00:02,352 --> 00:00:03,702
- Have you ever
heard of Brakebills?

3
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:05,204
<i>- No.
- It's, like, this secret Yale,</i>

4
00:00:05,206 --> 00:00:06,736
and you have to be able
to do magic to even get in.

5
00:00:06,741 --> 00:00:09,241
<i>- Well, I can do magic.
- Yeah, so can I.</i>

6
00:00:09,243 --> 00:00:10,443
<i>- Sorry, I just got
your e-mail.</i>

7
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:11,844
<i>- My fifth e-mail.</i>

8
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:13,276
<i>- Just tell me
what you meant by...</i>

9
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,710
- I mean not herself.
- I mean barely talks to me.

10
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:18,076
<i>She looks like a goddamn ghost.
She's not Julia.</i>

11
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:19,685
- I need you to tell them
they were wrong about me.

12
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:20,887
Tell them to test me again.

13
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:22,388
- I'm sorry,
but they would know.

14
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,760
It's really okay
if this is not your thing.

15
00:00:23,761 --> 00:00:25,758
- So you are...
- Top bitch in New York.

16
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,260
I'm willing to teach the right
people everything I know.

17
00:00:28,262 --> 00:00:29,802
- Who are we trying to contact?
- Charlie.

18
00:00:29,803 --> 00:00:32,297
- And who's Charlie?
- My brother. He died.

19
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,529
- Jesus, we could not have
screwed up that spell worse,

20
00:00:34,535 --> 00:00:35,595
and we can't take it back.

21
00:00:59,193 --> 00:01:00,593
<i>- Now that you're in,</i>

22
00:01:00,594 --> 00:01:03,930
it's time to learn some magic.

23
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:05,231
Just don't get too excited.

24
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,432
Start slow.

25
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:10,335
Yeah, I don't really do slow.

26
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:11,767
- Hmm...

27
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:22,918
<i>- Being a magician
has always been,</i>

28
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:24,677
<i>in part,</i>

29
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:28,945
<i>about accruing power.</i>

30
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:31,456
Power over yourself,

31
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:33,126
the elements.

32
00:01:33,127 --> 00:01:35,187
- Power over the future.
- He's back.

33
00:01:35,196 --> 00:01:38,356
- The very world
that exists around you...

34
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:39,825
He said he had an announcement.

35
00:01:39,834 --> 00:01:43,103
- But power, as you all know,

36
00:01:43,104 --> 00:01:44,774
does not come cheaply.

37
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:50,176
<i>There are reasons
we teach this curriculum</i>

38
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:52,946
<i>precisely the way that we do.</i>

39
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:54,547
<i>Skipping around,</i>

40
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:56,318
<i>focusing on
all the wrong things,</i>

41
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:57,877
<i>lack of guidance...</i>

42
00:01:57,885 --> 00:02:00,715
<i>these are all
extremely dangerous.</i>

43
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:04,521
<i>There are certain energies,
certain spells,</i>

44
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:09,325
<i>which are far too powerful
for one magician alone.</i>

45
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,366
If you lose control,
they will turn against you.

46
00:02:13,367 --> 00:02:17,036
They will kill you.
They will consume you.

47
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:18,967
Change you...

48
00:02:18,973 --> 00:02:20,973
into something else.

49
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:43,696
- Now that I have
your attention.

50
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:46,266
We test
to discern your discipline.

51
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:48,567
Your area of concentration.

52
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:49,869
It is what you are,

53
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,500
and with the right guidance,

54
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,205
you may safely rise

55
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:56,067
to unknowable heights.

56
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:57,776
You will find
your scheduled times

57
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:59,878
and invitations
inside your bags.

58
00:03:08,756 --> 00:03:10,216
- Hey, babe, it's me.

59
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:11,964
Um, ahem, just got your message.

60
00:03:11,965 --> 00:03:15,859
I'm so sorry, I got stuck.
Be there as soon as I can.

61
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:17,303
Love you.

62
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:26,638
- Never gets old, does it?

63
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,270
Having a secret.

64
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:30,775
You have magic.

65
00:03:30,778 --> 00:03:33,708
They don't.

66
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,481
Better than money.

67
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:38,382
Better than sex.

68
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,145
Well, I guess that one depends.

69
00:03:40,154 --> 00:03:42,624
- James is cool, really.
- He barely notices.

70
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:46,559
We've both been
so busy with school.

71
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,990
- Look...

72
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:51,296
we all juggle.

73
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:53,828
You're kicking ass.

74
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:56,836
Just don't forget
to manage your shit.

75
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:58,297
Don't want boyfriend
getting worried,

76
00:03:58,305 --> 00:03:59,935
following you
to the safe house door.

77
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,076
- Got it covered, okay.

78
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:04,837
- I know you do.

79
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:07,275
Just saying.

80
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:09,816
- Yes, these are promising.

81
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:11,977
I get a strong sense of blues

82
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:15,246
and... and pinks.

83
00:04:15,256 --> 00:04:17,016
Is that Alice Quinn?

84
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:20,193
Alice, please sit,
if there's a seat.

85
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:21,828
Bit of a transition.

86
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:24,029
I find that I prefer an office
that I can reach

87
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:25,861
without falling down
three flights of steps

88
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,096
that I cannot see.

89
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:29,001
This'll be quick, Alice.

90
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:31,173
Show Professor March
what you can do.

91
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:37,609
- Like I said, I used to do
a lot of coin and card tricks,

92
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,011
and I guess sometimes

93
00:04:39,013 --> 00:04:40,483
I, like, actually used
real magic.

94
00:04:40,484 --> 00:04:42,811
- Predictions
could mean psychic.

95
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:45,516
Vanishing could mean illusions
or physical magic.

96
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,487
Curious.

97
00:04:47,488 --> 00:04:48,688
- What? What's curious?

98
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:50,857
- Now, try holding these.

99
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:54,727
Think the alphabet in Greek.

100
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:56,028
No.

101
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,230
- Just lovely, Miss Quinn.

102
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:01,501
So clean.
Very advanced.

103
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:02,872
- Physical magic.
- Hm.

104
00:05:02,873 --> 00:05:04,470
- Definitely.

105
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:19,754
- Just stare at it.

106
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:23,415
Well, you're not an herbalist.

107
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:26,059
- Undetermined?
- Can they do that?

108
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,090
- Yeah, Sunderland said
it happens,

109
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:31,525
so I guess they'll
try again next year.

110
00:05:37,871 --> 00:05:39,171
- What's your discipline?

111
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:41,613
- Phosphoromancy.

112
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,178
I bend light.

113
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,379
- Holy shit!

114
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:49,050
- There are much cooler areas.

115
00:05:49,051 --> 00:05:51,718
- Are you kidding me?
- You have light bending power.

116
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:53,049
I'm a nothing-mancer.

117
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:55,953
I'm a squat-mancer.

118
00:05:55,956 --> 00:05:57,416
- Well, if you're undetermined,

119
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:58,724
then why are you
assigned to the Cottage?

120
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:02,186
- Literally,
they have extra space.

121
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:04,096
- Well, at least they have that

122
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:06,468
allegedly mind-blowing
signature cocktail.

123
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:08,427
Can't be all bad.

124
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:17,078
- Uh, is there a doorbell
I missed or something?

125
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,707
- No.

126
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:22,582
"Let yourselves in"
as in we have to figure out how.

127
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,550
- Right.

128
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,551
What a bunch of dicks.

129
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:36,662
Ow!

130
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:39,598
- This might actually be hard.

131
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:48,336
- Hey, what about
your light-bendy thing?

132
00:06:48,342 --> 00:06:51,782
Like... yeah, we could use,
like, a magnifying glass.

133
00:06:51,783 --> 00:06:55,309
You know, like,
you ever burn ants

134
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:58,745
- when you were a kid?
- No, that's horrifying.

135
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:31,777
- Phosphoromancy, bitches.

136
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,185
Whoo!

137
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:37,418
- What took you so long?
- I'm starving.

138
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,559
- Welcome to our gracious abode.

139
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:58,514
Shit.

140
00:08:04,585 --> 00:08:07,315
- You and your first year boys.

141
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:10,091
What is your obsession
with the flavor of the month?

142
00:08:10,092 --> 00:08:12,190
- Oh, come on.

143
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:15,492
He's a high-strung super nerd.

144
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:17,056
We love those.

145
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:25,235
- I'm not an experienced
drinker, Quentin.

146
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:28,439
- I couldn't tell.

147
00:08:28,442 --> 00:08:30,382
You know, it should have worked.

148
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:34,247
That spell we did
to reach my brother.

149
00:08:34,248 --> 00:08:37,778
I mean, I went over it,
like, a million times.

150
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:40,720
Should have?
You saying that like you...

151
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:42,688
wanna do it again.

152
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,889
Wait, you don't wanna
try it again, do you?

153
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:47,892
- I need to know the truth,
that's all.

154
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:51,525
You know, the spell
we did was, like...

155
00:08:51,532 --> 00:08:53,572
I don't know,
it was like a phone call.

156
00:08:53,573 --> 00:08:56,597
We made contact,
but he didn't pick up,

157
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:58,803
so then The Beast picked up.

158
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,065
But that still leaves
the question,

159
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:02,108
"Where's Charlie?"

160
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:05,439
- Well, the last time we asked
that question, somebody died.

161
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:06,745
Never mind.

162
00:09:06,747 --> 00:09:08,577
What do you care?

163
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:11,282
No.

164
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:13,285
I do. I care.
I wanna help.

165
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:16,417
I just... I don't...

166
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:21,661
Ooh, oh. Yeah.

167
00:09:21,662 --> 00:09:23,129
Um...

168
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,630
have you read Teukolsky yet?

169
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:28,501
Uh, so apparently

170
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:30,802
you can find deceased spirits

171
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,574
with a simple locator spell.

172
00:09:32,575 --> 00:09:34,273
If they wanna be found.

173
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:37,009
- That's stupid.

174
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,050
You're stupid.
You have a stupid face.

175
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:45,145
- Uh, anyone have a match?

176
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:47,420
Uh, it's not working.

177
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:49,451
- Just keep walking.

178
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:56,126
- Okay.
- Finally.

179
00:09:57,698 --> 00:09:59,658
- Guess it's Woof Fountain.

180
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:02,766
- Ugh. I never liked
this thing.

181
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,499
- Eliot says
it's enchanted as shit.

182
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,840
- Supposedly it's bottomless,

183
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:11,213
so you know
the psychics love it.

184
00:10:11,214 --> 00:10:12,778
Suicide fountain.

185
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,648
- You don't think
your brother...

186
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,379
- No.

187
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:18,722
He wasn't that kinda guy.

188
00:10:18,723 --> 00:10:20,919
He was the kinda guy
who always wanted

189
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:24,421
to fix things
for everyone around him.

190
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:27,426
He was really, really good.

191
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:29,257
You know that spell I did
on the first day of class?

192
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:31,330
The Glass Horse?

193
00:10:31,331 --> 00:10:33,831
He taught me that.

194
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:49,947
Come on, let's go.
Nothing's happening.

195
00:11:12,372 --> 00:11:13,806
Psychic?

196
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:15,637
I wanna punch Sunderland
in the throat.

197
00:11:15,642 --> 00:11:17,309
- You know, as a psychic,
you'd think

198
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,040
- you'd have seen all this coming.
- Oh, woman, please.

199
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:20,706
Ah!

200
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,216
Hold on.

201
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:28,817
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Whoa whoa.

202
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:30,090
Are we actually
doing this again?

203
00:11:30,091 --> 00:11:31,520
- Do you know how
to close your mind?

204
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,355
'Cause I will show you
right now.

205
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,990
- I thought I was.
- Eliot gave me a...

206
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:36,485
- Seriously, man?

207
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,396
Taylor Swift?

208
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:40,428
- I am not singing Taylor Swift

209
00:11:40,434 --> 00:11:42,304
in my head.

210
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:49,207
Okay, I'll work on it.

211
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,079
Jeez.

212
00:11:57,017 --> 00:12:00,517
- So, it's got lots of space.
- Lots of light.

213
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,090
- It looks really great.

214
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:06,121
- I'm sorry, I guess
I thought you were still

215
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:08,726
considering Yale
for the fall with me.

216
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:10,059
- What?

217
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:13,132
- Okay, can we just
talk about this now?

218
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:14,600
Where is your head?

219
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:17,101
Why do I feel like
I'm talking to myself?

220
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:19,704
- I'm... I've just been busy
with class...

221
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:20,936
- Are you seeing someone else?

222
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:22,910
- No! Why would you
ask that?

223
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,639
- Because you're different.

224
00:12:24,644 --> 00:12:27,113
You stand me up.
You don't answer your phone.

225
00:12:27,114 --> 00:12:29,614
I'm just... I'm starting
to feel like the asshole.

226
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:32,076
- You're not.

227
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:36,387
- Hey...

228
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,457
I love you.

229
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:41,427
You know that.

230
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,428
Look, I know
I've been moody lately,

231
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,630
but...

232
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:47,666
I feel a lot better.

233
00:12:47,667 --> 00:12:50,437
James, come on.

234
00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:54,839
Hey.

235
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,106
Mm.

236
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:00,679
- Okay, go on.

237
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,080
Someone killed themselves
in the fountain?

238
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:04,122
- Try 15 students and one dean.

239
00:13:04,123 --> 00:13:07,486
Van Pelt.
Fountain's named after him.

240
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:11,357
It does feel a little bit off
here though, doesn't it?

241
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:17,496
- Brief announcement.

242
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:21,467
The Van Pelt fountain is
temporarily off limits.

243
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:22,968
There's been an incursion.

244
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:29,668
We believe it's
a garden variety haunting.

245
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:33,136
Redrawing the wards
may have released it

246
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:35,646
much like a mouse caught
in the walls of a building.

247
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:37,016
- Help!

248
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:39,477
- No one was seriously hurt.

249
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,616
Both students involved
are recuperating

250
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:43,821
in the infirmary.

251
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:45,558
Regardless,

252
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:49,429
stay away until we lock it down.

253
00:13:50,597 --> 00:13:52,497
- Ow. I mean,
what if it was Charlie?

254
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,729
- I don't know.
- Maybe.

255
00:13:54,734 --> 00:13:58,337
If not, it's
a pretty big coincidence.

256
00:13:58,338 --> 00:13:59,698
- But if it was Charlie,
don't you think

257
00:13:59,706 --> 00:14:01,006
that he would have
reached out to you

258
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,407
directly...

259
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:07,252
- Maybe he just did.

260
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:17,492
- Okay.

261
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:22,733
So, why would he try
and drown a bunch of psychics.

262
00:14:22,734 --> 00:14:25,559
- Uh, have you met them?

263
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:28,495
Are you two talking about
what happened at Woof?

264
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:31,437
- I... that was
a private conversation.

265
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:34,368
- You know.
- Well, meow.

266
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:39,608
- What was that?

267
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:42,047
- I just... I don't trust her.

268
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:45,048
- Okay, look.
- I just...

269
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,751
I think trying to drown people
seems a little violent.

270
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:49,594
- He may not have even
known what he was doing.

271
00:14:49,595 --> 00:14:51,857
I mean, spirits,
they can get confused.

272
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:53,218
- Okay, then how do
we talk to him

273
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,386
without him trying to drown us?

274
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,426
- I don't know.

275
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:01,432
But first thing's first.
I found a spell...

276
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,402
Well, five actually, but they
all have their own down side.

277
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,203
Like, we don't know
how Charlie died exactly

278
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:06,535
and the moon is
in the wrong spot right now.

279
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:08,207
- Look, I know
you don't trust her,

280
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,108
- but maybe Margo could...
- Or there's a Maori spell.

281
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,610
I'd have to cut off a finger,
but they might be preferable.

282
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:14,480
- To talking to Margo?

283
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:18,317
- Quentin, I need your help.
- Highest priority.

284
00:15:18,318 --> 00:15:20,386
- Let's go.
- Okay.

285
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:22,387
I... hey, look,
you said it yourself,

286
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:23,619
you don't have all the facts,

287
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:25,123
so maybe you don't need a spell.

288
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,485
Maybe you need information,

289
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:30,503
and Margo's Discipline
is gossip, so...

290
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:43,007
- We have a real problem.

291
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:44,339
- Is it in the box?

292
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:47,812
- Professor Sunderland
came looking for a book

293
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:49,954
from the Physical
Cottage Library,

294
00:15:49,955 --> 00:15:51,680
and it's missing.

295
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:52,945
I diverted her attention, but...

296
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:54,323
- What does that
have to do with the box?

297
00:15:54,324 --> 00:15:56,588
- Books at Brakebills, Quentin,

298
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:57,789
are not just books.

299
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,160
One goes missing, it's not just

300
00:15:59,161 --> 00:16:00,928
a library fine
we're talking about here.

301
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:03,357
- What're we talking about?
- We're talking about...

302
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:05,831
We have...

303
00:16:05,832 --> 00:16:07,632
occasional parties.

304
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,334
During one, someone took a book,

305
00:16:09,336 --> 00:16:11,036
and if we don't find that book

306
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:13,137
the faculty are going to take
a harder look at our parties,

307
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,909
and that cannot happen, Quentin.

308
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:20,507
- So you gonna tell me
what's in the box or...

309
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:26,719
What the hell is that?

310
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,350
- The missing book
is Volume One.

311
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:31,915
That... is Volume Two.

312
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,496
She's going to lead us
to her mate.

313
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:39,357
- Oh.

314
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:42,096
<i>- Odemknout.</i>

315
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,171
<i>Odemknout.</i>

316
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,640
Shit.

317
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:50,541
Uh, let me...
Let me try it again.

318
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:53,479
- Should be easy.
- You're distracted.

319
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,410
I know I have a lot going on.

320
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:56,845
- No, you don't.
- You have this spell.

321
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,520
That's it.

322
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:03,687
- So how do you manage it all?

323
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,859
Juggling magic and your life?

324
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:11,160
- I don't understand
the question.

325
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:12,898
I'm not judging you.

326
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:16,429
I started out like you
and you have a good life.

327
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:18,336
Boyfriend.

328
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:20,538
Probably think
he keeps you centered.

329
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,608
- Right?
- Kinda.

330
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:26,578
- Or, you know, you're keeping
him around in case you fail here

331
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:29,379
and need to fall back.

332
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:32,251
All I know...
you have to mean it

333
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:33,682
for magic to work.

334
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:37,356
Something clicks
when you're all-in,

335
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:42,057
and the real big stuff,
you can't do it

336
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:45,302
till you're doing it
without a net.

337
00:17:58,211 --> 00:18:00,946
- I...

338
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:02,377
I need your help.

339
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:05,622
- That wasn't so hard, was it?

340
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,150
- Look, I'm just trying

341
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:11,115
to find out what happened
to my brother.

342
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:13,624
He was a student here
five years ago.

343
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:15,486
- Okay.

344
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:20,765
- He was a physical kid.

345
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,327
His name was Charlie,

346
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:24,766
and he died.

347
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:28,740
- Know what?
- I did hear about that.

348
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:30,909
At Woof, right?

349
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,279
Five, six years back?

350
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,080
It's all making sense now.

351
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:38,250
- What is?
- You.

352
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:40,081
The awkward thing.

353
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:43,316
The anger underneath
the ineffable air of tragedy

354
00:18:43,323 --> 00:18:45,993
you wear like a perfume.

355
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:50,857
- Look, can you just tell me
what you know about Charlie?

356
00:18:50,864 --> 00:18:52,934
- Please?
- Loathe as I am to admit it,

357
00:18:52,935 --> 00:18:56,702
I don't actually know anything.

358
00:18:56,703 --> 00:18:58,770
Although, there was a girl

359
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:01,306
from Charlie's year who might.

360
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,837
Emily Greenstreet.

361
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:05,310
- Who was she?

362
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,778
- Just a girl.

363
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:09,448
When he died,
apparently she took it hard.

364
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:11,379
Dropped out.
Gave up magic.

365
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:12,951
The Full Muggle.

366
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:14,820
It was a bit of a scandal.

367
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,221
- Where is she now?

368
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:17,456
- The city.

369
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:19,017
Fogg set her up with a job

370
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:22,355
which is how you know
they're hiding something big.

371
00:19:22,362 --> 00:19:24,562
I know how to find her.

372
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:26,004
Come on, I'll show you.

373
00:19:26,005 --> 00:19:28,467
- I'd actually
prefer to go alone.

374
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:31,737
- Oh, I know you would, but...

375
00:19:31,738 --> 00:19:33,838
what choice do you really have?

376
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:47,152
- Penny.

377
00:19:47,153 --> 00:19:50,556
Welcome.
Knew you were coming.

378
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:52,257
I know you've been
dreading this,

379
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:54,588
but you're gonna like it.

380
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:57,829
The coves are for meditation

381
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,530
while the enclosed
"Consciousness Areas"

382
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:04,103
are reserved as a place
to cry, and process.

383
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,540
Hm.

384
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,876
We call it "The Amplifier."

385
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:13,007
So basically, it's like turning

386
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:15,112
your psychic powers up to 11.

387
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:16,754
- Why would you wanna do that?

388
00:20:16,755 --> 00:20:18,417
- Oh, I get it.

389
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:20,848
You're one of those guys
who's trying to shut it out.

390
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:23,053
You wanna get control of it

391
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:26,586
or it will mess up your shit
big time,

392
00:20:26,593 --> 00:20:28,563
and this is the best place
to practice.

393
00:20:28,564 --> 00:20:31,129
- So...

394
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,360
I do what?

395
00:20:32,365 --> 00:20:33,555
- Sit.

396
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,866
Relax.

397
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:36,567
Let your mind wander.

398
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:37,936
It's pretty simple.

399
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:40,297
But you gotta start
by letting go, tough guy.

400
00:20:40,306 --> 00:20:43,136
Less talking.

401
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:44,412
No touching.

402
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:14,006
<i>- Help!</i>

403
00:21:14,007 --> 00:21:16,507
<i>Please!
Help me!</i>

404
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:28,052
- Emily?

405
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:30,815
No, don't run.

406
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:32,493
These shoes are insane.

407
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:38,828
- You're from Brakebills,
aren't you?

408
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:40,231
That part of my life
is behind me.

409
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:43,073
- I'm sorry.
- Charlie was my brother.

410
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:53,205
I just wanna know
what happened to him.

411
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:56,648
- Your brother saved my life.

412
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:59,879
Well, he tried to at least.

413
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:03,016
So, I fell for this professor.

414
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:05,390
I know how it sounds,

415
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:08,391
but I was young and...

416
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:11,363
and he loved me.

417
00:22:11,364 --> 00:22:15,267
But then, well, he was married.

418
00:22:15,268 --> 00:22:17,368
You know how it is
when you're that age.

419
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:20,770
You get... terrible ideas.

420
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:23,342
- Hmm.

421
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:25,610
Like what?

422
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:29,411
- I thought I could
make him love me again.

423
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:31,575
- Oh, some kind of love spell?

424
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:34,753
- No.

425
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:36,621
No.

426
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:41,526
I thought if I could
make myself prettier.

427
00:22:41,527 --> 00:22:44,127
- Oh... God.

428
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:46,430
- No one warned you
how dangerous that was?

429
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:49,368
- I knew,
but I'd convinced myself

430
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:54,039
that it was the only way.

431
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,908
It took me weeks

432
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:59,709
to figure out how to do it,

433
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:02,412
and...

434
00:23:02,415 --> 00:23:04,875
<i>when I did, well, you...</i>

435
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:06,624
<i>You can imagine how that went.</i>

436
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:17,094
No...

437
00:23:24,704 --> 00:23:28,273
I was gonna... I was
gonna kill myself.

438
00:23:28,274 --> 00:23:31,076
Emily!

439
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:33,237
Wait!

440
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:35,476
What happened?

441
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:37,481
What did you do?

442
00:23:42,688 --> 00:23:44,956
- Please.

443
00:23:44,957 --> 00:23:47,787
I just wanna help.

444
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:01,938
- Don't tell anyone, please.

445
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,271
- Course not.

446
00:24:03,276 --> 00:24:04,876
Wait here.
I'll be back.

447
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:06,507
I'm gonna fix this.

448
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:12,717
He mashed a...

449
00:24:12,718 --> 00:24:14,148
bunch of stuff together.

450
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:15,987
<i>It was...</i>

451
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:17,558
<i>It was totally untested.</i>

452
00:24:19,492 --> 00:24:21,860
I really believed

453
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:25,030
he might actually
be able to undo what I did.

454
00:24:25,031 --> 00:24:28,131
He was a good magician.

455
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:30,368
You know, he...

456
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:34,406
He woulda done anything for me.

457
00:24:34,407 --> 00:24:36,507
<i>It was a lot.
It was... it was...</i>

458
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:39,539
It was too much.

459
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:43,575
I begged him to stop,
but he wouldn't,

460
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:47,053
and that's when it went
totally out of control.

461
00:24:57,396 --> 00:24:59,756
It burned...

462
00:24:59,765 --> 00:25:02,995
right through him...

463
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:07,506
until he wasn't there anymore.

464
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:11,007
He was...
Do you know what a Niffin is?

465
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:15,210
- No.
- Yes.

466
00:25:15,214 --> 00:25:17,184
- It's when too much
runs through you.

467
00:25:17,185 --> 00:25:19,417
Consumes you.

468
00:25:19,418 --> 00:25:22,448
Only the magic is left,

469
00:25:22,455 --> 00:25:25,385
but you're not

470
00:25:25,391 --> 00:25:26,621
you anymore.

471
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:28,956
You're...

472
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:31,930
lost.

473
00:25:31,931 --> 00:25:34,399
- Where did Charlie go?

474
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,867
- I don't know.

475
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:39,868
He was just gone.

476
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:42,272
I never saw him again.

477
00:25:42,275 --> 00:25:45,075
- Um, who did all this then?

478
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,480
- My professor.

479
00:25:49,482 --> 00:25:52,751
- Well, I guess you got
his attention after all.

480
00:25:52,752 --> 00:25:54,152
- I quit school.

481
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:56,721
Gave up magic,
and never looked back.

482
00:25:56,722 --> 00:26:01,362
I'm so sorry about Charlie.

483
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:09,131
- Hear that?
- She's getting excited.

484
00:26:09,135 --> 00:26:11,435
I think we're close.

485
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:13,867
Hold this, will you?

486
00:26:17,777 --> 00:26:21,807
This bodega is warded
up the ass.

487
00:26:25,451 --> 00:26:26,781
Hedge witches.

488
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:29,486
Amateurs.
Magical D-leaguers.

489
00:26:29,488 --> 00:26:31,818
Sad and desperate people.

490
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:34,764
Once one of 'em offered
to blow me for a spell.

491
00:26:34,765 --> 00:26:37,260
It was fairly worth it.

492
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:38,663
Let me do the talking.

493
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,185
- These are witches?

494
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,558
- Hm. Pathetic. No?

495
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:10,528
Ugh, this kid's trying
Popper number four.

496
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:12,759
It's painful.

497
00:27:17,703 --> 00:27:19,273
- Hear you're selling something.

498
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:23,637
- Quentin?

499
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:25,883
- Oh, hey.

500
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:32,283
- What the hell
are you doing here?

501
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:34,019
- You know these guys?

502
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,320
- Yeah, they're from Brakebills.

503
00:27:35,321 --> 00:27:36,521
- We're friends.
- That's right.

504
00:27:36,522 --> 00:27:38,189
We're from Brakebills.

505
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:40,920
We're classically trained
and we want our book.

506
00:27:40,926 --> 00:27:43,756
- We don't have
your stupid book.

507
00:27:55,107 --> 00:27:57,007
Are they?

508
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,778
- Yep.

509
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:01,079
Love wins.

510
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:16,728
- Hey!

511
00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:18,059
So, that's it?

512
00:28:18,064 --> 00:28:19,334
That's all you're
gonna say to me?

513
00:28:19,335 --> 00:28:21,031
- Don't talk to her.
- Keep going.

514
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:23,133
- I don't know what
you're doing here, Jules.

515
00:28:23,135 --> 00:28:24,965
You're better than this.

516
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,738
- You say that
like I had a choice.

517
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:28,209
- Of course you have a choice.
- No, because guess what?

518
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:31,076
Magic wasn't just handed to me.

519
00:28:31,077 --> 00:28:35,207
I told you to please
tell them about me.

520
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,014
At first, you know,
I thought maybe

521
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:39,146
they'd actually test me again,

522
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:40,821
and then I figured someone
would at least come

523
00:28:40,822 --> 00:28:43,850
and try to take my memory
again, and then...

524
00:28:43,856 --> 00:28:46,556
just waiting.

525
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,029
It took me weeks to realize

526
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:51,996
you never even
told them about me at all.

527
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:54,766
- Look, Jules, I...
- You were my best friend.

528
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:57,527
- Yeah, and so I let it go.

529
00:28:57,536 --> 00:28:59,996
What does that mean,
"you let it go?"

530
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:01,735
No, that's crazy,
I can actually do...

531
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:04,271
- The people at Brakebills,
Jules, they can bend light.

532
00:29:04,276 --> 00:29:05,936
They can read minds.
They can fly.

533
00:29:05,945 --> 00:29:08,175
You can do a party trick.

534
00:29:11,217 --> 00:29:13,277
- So this is it, huh?

535
00:29:13,285 --> 00:29:15,115
The real you.

536
00:29:15,121 --> 00:29:17,891
- Do you ever stop to think
about how maybe you treated me?

537
00:29:17,892 --> 00:29:19,590
- What?

538
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:21,126
I was always there...

539
00:29:21,127 --> 00:29:23,027
- What? You were so nice
and you were so sweet

540
00:29:23,028 --> 00:29:26,058
to poor little Q who couldn't
get his shit together.

541
00:29:26,065 --> 00:29:27,925
- Don't put that on me.
- Between you and James it was

542
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,571
- a two for one charity case.
- That's your interpretation.

543
00:29:29,572 --> 00:29:31,398
- Why are you saying this?
- Because that is true, Julia!

544
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:35,373
- No, that's not true. I...
- You know how I felt about you.

545
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:37,144
- I don't know what...
- Admit it. Just admit it.

546
00:29:37,145 --> 00:29:39,183
Admit it.

547
00:29:42,014 --> 00:29:43,952
- So, you're gonna
punish me for that?

548
00:29:43,953 --> 00:29:45,949
- I don't know what else to say.

549
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:49,051
You can't blame me.

550
00:29:49,054 --> 00:29:51,556
Does James even
know that you're here?

551
00:29:51,557 --> 00:29:53,087
You're hanging out
with a bunch of tweakers

552
00:29:53,092 --> 00:29:54,492
who are turning tricks
for spells.

553
00:29:54,493 --> 00:29:55,961
- Are you kidding me?
- These people wanna...

554
00:29:55,962 --> 00:29:57,291
- Stop slumming
because you're pissed

555
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,196
that you lost
for once in your life.

556
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:04,901
I'm sorry, but I mean it.

557
00:30:04,904 --> 00:30:06,444
You could really get hurt
doing this shit,

558
00:30:06,445 --> 00:30:09,568
and for what?

559
00:30:09,575 --> 00:30:13,005
Grow up.

560
00:30:13,012 --> 00:30:15,052
- Do you love magic?

561
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,720
Is it in your soul?

562
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:27,159
Is it like the secret heart
of what you always were?

563
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:33,362
Yeah.

564
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:36,195
So you know how I feel.

565
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:11,374
- Get in.

566
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:21,980
- Penny, how's your head?

567
00:31:21,981 --> 00:31:24,411
- How you think?

568
00:31:26,886 --> 00:31:28,316
So, what's wrong with me?

569
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,888
- Nothing's wrong.

570
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:32,159
I made the mistake of thinking
you were just psychic,

571
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,387
but it...
it's more complicated.

572
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:38,930
- You are a Traveller.

573
00:31:38,931 --> 00:31:41,599
- A what now?

574
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,030
- The rarest

575
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:44,835
and most difficult Discipline.

576
00:31:44,837 --> 00:31:46,837
Travellers can,
with a little bit of training,

577
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:48,769
go anywhere on Earth instantly

578
00:31:48,774 --> 00:31:50,341
just as you did.

579
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:54,412
But you can, with a great
deal of training,

580
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:58,016
actually move between worlds.

581
00:31:58,017 --> 00:32:00,217
- Go to other worlds?
- Yes.

582
00:32:00,219 --> 00:32:03,619
If the gift
does not kill you first.

583
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:06,891
- Great. Just fu**ing great.

584
00:32:06,892 --> 00:32:10,092
- Do you know why I'm here?

585
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,595
To say this.

586
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:13,697
You've been a thin layer
of insouciance

587
00:32:13,699 --> 00:32:17,129
over an open pit of self-pity
your entire life.

588
00:32:17,136 --> 00:32:19,036
This is not a joke.

589
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:20,768
You do not have the luxury
to mess around

590
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:22,442
now that this is
out of the bottle.

591
00:32:22,443 --> 00:32:24,411
You will study this.
You will master this.

592
00:32:24,412 --> 00:32:25,910
Do you understand?

593
00:32:25,911 --> 00:32:28,780
Ain't you a bucket of empathy,
blind man.

594
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:31,549
- Please say yes.

595
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:35,119
I cannot see you nod.

596
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,150
- Fine.

597
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:40,193
Yes.

598
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:45,001
So, are we just gonna drive
all the way back to Brakebills?

599
00:32:45,002 --> 00:32:47,997
- We're already there.

600
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:00,843
- Penny.

601
00:33:00,846 --> 00:33:03,076
I've learned a great deal

602
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:04,851
about Travelling over the years.

603
00:33:04,852 --> 00:33:06,750
We'll start one-on-one tutorials

604
00:33:06,752 --> 00:33:08,692
to help you get
a handle on your ability.

605
00:33:08,693 --> 00:33:10,147
- Yes,

606
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:12,955
before you accidentally
transport yourself

607
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:16,458
inside a volcano.

608
00:33:26,438 --> 00:33:28,668
- She's right.

609
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:30,014
We were best friends.

610
00:33:31,944 --> 00:33:33,644
- Should we help?
- No.

611
00:33:33,645 --> 00:33:36,045
<i>- Let me in, you assholes!</i>

612
00:33:36,048 --> 00:33:39,978
- I don't know what happened.
- I don't know how it got so bad.

613
00:33:39,985 --> 00:33:42,015
- You found out who you are

614
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:44,721
and she found out who she's not.

615
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:45,963
Life.

616
00:33:49,228 --> 00:33:52,196
Tell you what.

617
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:55,327
Let's not talk.

618
00:33:58,037 --> 00:34:00,037
Shit!

619
00:34:02,508 --> 00:34:05,378
How long were you to douchebags
gonna leave me out there?

620
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:08,477
- Oh, never mind that.

621
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,580
Now you're with your people.

622
00:34:11,583 --> 00:34:14,252
Cheers to that.

623
00:34:14,253 --> 00:34:16,923
Good God.

624
00:34:18,457 --> 00:34:22,127
Cheers.

625
00:34:29,101 --> 00:34:31,269
- This have a lid?
- There isn't one.

626
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,640
The Niffin becomes
fused with the wood.

627
00:34:32,641 --> 00:34:34,298
It's unable to escape.

628
00:34:34,306 --> 00:34:36,466
- How do you activate it?
- There's a short chant.

629
00:34:36,475 --> 00:34:38,075
You just basically repeat
"I bind you"

630
00:34:38,077 --> 00:34:39,477
in Turkish and English.

631
00:34:39,478 --> 00:34:41,038
- That sounds a little easy.

632
00:34:41,046 --> 00:34:42,876
- Well, that and the
month long incantation it took

633
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:44,611
to enchant the thing
in the first place.

634
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:48,286
- So, this is
the enchantment research?

635
00:34:48,287 --> 00:34:50,887
- We're not gonna use the box.

636
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:53,219
- What?

637
00:34:53,225 --> 00:34:54,885
- We're gonna
bring Charlie back.

638
00:34:54,893 --> 00:34:57,593
- Okay, Alice this is the point

639
00:34:57,596 --> 00:35:00,556
where I look at you
like you're nuts.

640
00:35:00,566 --> 00:35:02,466
I... okay, look.

641
00:35:02,468 --> 00:35:03,968
I've been doing some research,

642
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:06,838
um, on Niffins.

643
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:08,109
Look, they're not even alive.

644
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:10,567
Th... they're...
something else.

645
00:35:10,576 --> 00:35:12,306
- Look, I can't explain it,

646
00:35:12,311 --> 00:35:14,278
but I know that he's out there.
He's somewhere.

647
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:15,509
- Is there anything
in the literature that says

648
00:35:15,514 --> 00:35:17,014
that going Niffin is reversible?

649
00:35:17,015 --> 00:35:18,815
- Nothing says that it isn't.

650
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:20,817
Exactly.

651
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:22,789
So I found this spell
that can transmutate

652
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:26,318
certain meta-quantum energies
into matter... in theory.

653
00:35:26,325 --> 00:35:28,155
And I combined it with an
advanced transformation ritual...

654
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,590
- Alice, this is Major Arcana...

655
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:30,985
- What? Just because
you couldn't do it?

656
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:32,426
- Nobody could do it.

657
00:35:32,431 --> 00:35:33,631
You're making it up
as you go along.

658
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:35,432
Look, I...

659
00:35:35,434 --> 00:35:37,634
- You are an amazing magician...
- Don't patronize me.

660
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,036
- I'm not patronizing you.
- I'm telling you that

661
00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:41,267
- this is not a good idea.
- What do you know?

662
00:35:41,273 --> 00:35:43,007
Hmm?

663
00:35:43,008 --> 00:35:44,268
You only learned
about magic, what?

664
00:35:44,276 --> 00:35:46,176
- Three months ago?
- Okay, sure.

665
00:35:46,178 --> 00:35:47,978
I... but even I can tell
that this is crazy.

666
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,780
I don't understand
why you can't see that.

667
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:52,016
- Fine. Stay behind.

668
00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:53,377
I'm here, and I'm only here,
to find out

669
00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:54,715
what happened to Charlie,

670
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,120
and now that I know
I can help him

671
00:35:56,121 --> 00:35:57,951
I'm going to.

672
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:18,137
- Thanks for coming so quick.

673
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:20,843
- I was kinda surprised
you called.

674
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:23,046
Thought you disappeared again.

675
00:36:23,048 --> 00:36:24,978
You okay?

676
00:36:26,185 --> 00:36:28,845
- You wanna talk about it?

677
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:31,254
Please?

678
00:36:31,256 --> 00:36:33,316
- Last call, Julia.
- I...

679
00:36:33,325 --> 00:36:36,755
I don't know
how to talk about it.

680
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:42,634
I got involved with something.

681
00:36:44,002 --> 00:36:47,538
Made me wanna
give up everything.

682
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:49,669
Life, school...

683
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:53,505
all of it.

684
00:36:53,512 --> 00:36:56,212
It got under my skin,

685
00:36:56,215 --> 00:36:58,275
and it...

686
00:36:58,283 --> 00:37:02,220
- And?

687
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:05,091
Jules, just tell me.

688
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:10,789
- It's Adderall.

689
00:37:10,796 --> 00:37:13,456
I started taking it

690
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:15,095
when I was applying
to grad school,

691
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,536
and then I was taking
more and more.

692
00:37:18,537 --> 00:37:22,306
I know I've been a bitch,

693
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:25,577
but lately I've been
going to meetings.

694
00:37:27,379 --> 00:37:29,609
- Wow.

695
00:37:35,654 --> 00:37:37,922
- I...

696
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:39,657
Can I...

697
00:37:39,658 --> 00:37:41,988
I don't know, can I hug you?

698
00:37:41,994 --> 00:37:44,964
- I wish you would.

699
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:49,328
- It's okay, Jules.

700
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:51,936
- I really love you, you know.

701
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:54,237
- I know.
- I'm amazing.

702
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:25,867
- Okay, so, we're here, and...

703
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:28,541
- Arrive at the place
of his transformation.

704
00:38:28,542 --> 00:38:32,540
Present yourself.

705
00:38:32,544 --> 00:38:34,478
There's a third step.

706
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:37,679
- What's the third step?

707
00:38:37,683 --> 00:38:41,652
- I have to call in to him with
something personal between us,

708
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:44,121
um...

709
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:46,862
so Charlie used to sing to me
my favorite song

710
00:38:46,863 --> 00:38:48,526
when I was feeling bad

711
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:50,427
which is kind of all the time.

712
00:38:59,404 --> 00:39:01,714
- Is that "The Breakfast Club"?

713
00:39:24,396 --> 00:39:27,296
- Alice, look.

714
00:39:33,638 --> 00:39:39,438
- Charlie, Charlie?

715
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:50,349
- Charlie, is that you?
- Alice.

716
00:39:50,355 --> 00:39:54,255
- Oh, my God, Charlie,
I can't believe it's you.

717
00:39:54,259 --> 00:39:59,429
I missed you so much.
I don't even know what to say.

718
00:39:59,431 --> 00:40:02,731
Charlie, what are you doing?

719
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:03,734
Charlie, you're hurting me.

720
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:05,695
Charlie, that hurts.

721
00:40:08,774 --> 00:40:10,774
- You're just confused,
Charlie, it's me.

722
00:40:13,712 --> 00:40:16,781
Charlie... Charlie,
why are you doing this?

723
00:40:16,782 --> 00:40:18,616
- Why?

724
00:40:18,617 --> 00:40:19,947
- Alice, I don't think...
- I don't think that we should...

725
00:40:19,951 --> 00:40:20,951
- I know you're
in there, Charlie.

726
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:22,492
- I know it's you.
- Alice

727
00:40:22,493 --> 00:40:25,256
- Hah!

728
00:40:25,257 --> 00:40:29,327
- Charlie, stop!
- I can help you.

729
00:40:38,437 --> 00:40:40,167
- Alice, stop!

730
00:40:49,514 --> 00:40:51,352
- Alice, he's gonna kill us.
- It's not gonna work.

731
00:40:51,353 --> 00:40:53,079
- You have to stop.
- Shut up, I can do this.

732
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:54,684
- Alice, it's not Charlie.

733
00:40:57,022 --> 00:40:58,522
- Oh, shit.
- Shit.

734
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:05,429
<i>- Emrediyorum</i>

735
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:10,030
- Alice, stop!
- You're gonna kill yourself.

736
00:41:10,035 --> 00:41:11,835
You are bound and held fast.

737
00:41:11,837 --> 00:41:13,837
<i>Seni baglamak</i>

738
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,039
- No!
- No!

739
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,870
- I bind you!
<i>- Seni baglamak.</i>

740
00:41:17,876 --> 00:41:19,036
- No!
- I bind you!

741
00:41:19,044 --> 00:41:21,384
<i>Seni baglamak.</i>

742
00:41:29,321 --> 00:41:33,721
- You... you brought the box.

743
00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:37,185
- Yeah.

744
00:41:37,195 --> 00:41:39,055
Alice, he was gonna kill you.

745
00:41:39,064 --> 00:41:42,733
- Why did you think
you had to save me?

746
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:45,469
Fu** you, Quentin.

747
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:48,000
You had no idea
what I was doing.

748
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:51,666
I was so close,
and now he's gone.

749
00:42:15,534 --> 00:42:17,404
- Where you going, kitty cat?

750
00:42:17,405 --> 00:42:19,737
- I'm done here.
- For good.

751
00:42:19,738 --> 00:42:21,498
You should be happy.
Less competition.

752
00:42:21,506 --> 00:42:24,006
- Alice.

753
00:42:24,009 --> 00:42:26,079
I like competition.
