<i>Previously on The Magicians</i>...

2
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:02,643
Have you ever
heard of Brakebills?

3
00:00:02,728 --> 00:00:04,520
<i>- No.</i>
<i>- It's, like, this secret Yale,</i>

4
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,640
and you have to be able
to do magic to even get in.

5
00:00:06,651 --> 00:00:09,484
<i>- Well, I can do magic.</i>
<i>- Yeah, so can I.</i>

6
00:00:09,604 --> 00:00:10,764
<i>Sorry, I just got</i>
<i>your e-mail.</i>

7
00:00:10,805 --> 00:00:12,137
<i>My fifth e-mail.</i>

8
00:00:12,189 --> 00:00:13,555
<i>Just tell me</i>
<i>what you meant by--</i>

9
00:00:13,641 --> 00:00:15,975
I mean not herself.
I mean barely talks to me.

10
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:18,360
<i>She looks like a goddamn ghost.</i>
<i>She's not Julia.</i>

11
00:00:18,446 --> 00:00:19,979
I need you to tell them
they were wrong about me.

12
00:00:20,031 --> 00:00:21,180
Tell them to test me again.

13
00:00:21,249 --> 00:00:22,648
I'm sorry, but they would know.

14
00:00:22,733 --> 00:00:24,033
It's really okay
if this is not your thing.

15
00:00:24,118 --> 00:00:26,035
- So you are--
- Top bitch in New York.

16
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,537
I'm willing to teach the right
people everything I know.

17
00:00:28,623 --> 00:00:30,072
- Who are we trying to contact?
- Charlie.

18
00:00:30,157 --> 00:00:32,574
- And who's Charlie?
- My brother. He died.

19
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,827
Jesus, we could not have
screwed up that spell worse,

20
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:35,919
and we can't take it back.

21
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,853
<i>Now that you're in,</i>

22
00:01:00,938 --> 00:01:04,189
it's time to learn some magic.

23
00:01:04,275 --> 00:01:05,524
Just don't get too excited.

24
00:01:05,576 --> 00:01:07,693
Start slow.

25
00:01:07,778 --> 00:01:10,612
Yeah, I don't really do slow.

26
00:01:10,698 --> 00:01:12,031
Hmm...

27
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:23,208
<i>Being a magician</i>
<i>has always been,</i>

28
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,960
<i>in part,</i>

29
00:01:25,046 --> 00:01:29,214
<i>about accruing power.</i>

30
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,717
Power over yourself,

31
00:01:31,802 --> 00:01:33,385
the elements.

32
00:01:33,471 --> 00:01:35,471
- Power over the future.
- He's back.

33
00:01:35,556 --> 00:01:38,640
The very world
that exists around you...

34
00:01:38,726 --> 00:01:40,109
He said he had an announcement.

35
00:01:40,194 --> 00:01:43,395
But power, as you all know,

36
00:01:43,447 --> 00:01:45,064
does not come cheaply.

37
00:01:46,734 --> 00:01:50,452
<i>There are reasons</i>
<i>we teach this curriculum</i>

38
00:01:50,538 --> 00:01:53,238
<i>precisely the way that we do.</i>

39
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,823
<i>Skipping around,</i>

40
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:56,575
<i>focusing on</i>
<i>all the wrong things,</i>

41
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,160
<i>lack of guidance...</i>

42
00:01:58,245 --> 00:02:00,996
<i>these are all</i>
<i>extremely dangerous.</i>

43
00:02:01,082 --> 00:02:04,800
<i>There are certain energies,</i>
<i>certain spells,</i>

44
00:02:04,885 --> 00:02:09,588
<i>which are far too powerful</i>
<i>for one magician alone.</i>

45
00:02:09,673 --> 00:02:13,642
If you lose control,
they will turn against you.

46
00:02:13,728 --> 00:02:17,312
They will kill you.
They will consume you.

47
00:02:17,398 --> 00:02:19,264
Change you...

48
00:02:19,316 --> 00:02:21,266

00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:46,542
We test

Your area of concentration.

53
00:02:48,929 --> 00:02:50,129
It is what you are,

54
00:02:50,214 --> 00:02:51,797
and with the right guidance,

55
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:53,465

Um, ahem, just got your message.

61
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,155
I'm so sorry, I got stuck.
Be there as soon as I can.

62
00:03:16,207 --> 00:03:17,573
Love you.

63
00:03:24,248 --> 00:03:26,915
Never gets old, does it?

64
00:03:27,001 --> 00:03:28,550
Having a secret.

65
00:03:28,636 --> 00:03:31,053
You have magic.

66
00:03:31,138 --> 00:03:34,006
They don't.

67
00:03:34,058 --> 00:03:35,757
Better than money.

68
00:03:35,843 --> 00:03:38,677
Better than sex.

69
00:03:38,729 --> 00:03:40,429
Well, I guess that one depends.

70
00:03:40,514 --> 00:03:42,898
James is cool, really.
He barely notices.

71
00:03:42,983 --> 00:03:46,852
We've both been
so busy with school.

72
00:03:46,904 --> 00:03:49,271
Look...

73
00:03:49,356 --> 00:03:51,573
we all juggle.

74
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:54,109
You're kicking ass.

75
00:03:54,195 --> 00:03:57,112
Just don't forget
to manage your shit.

76
00:03:57,198 --> 00:03:58,638
Don't want boyfriend
getting worried,

77
00:03:58,666 --> 00:04:00,199
following you
to the safe house door.

78
00:04:00,284 --> 00:04:03,368
Got it covered, okay.

79
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,120
I know you do.

80
00:04:05,206 --> 00:04:07,539
Just saying.

81
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:10,092
Yes, these are promising.

82
00:04:10,177 --> 00:04:12,261
I get a strong sense of blues

83
00:04:12,346 --> 00:04:15,547
and...and pinks.

84
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,299
Is that Alice Quinn?

85
00:04:17,384 --> 00:04:20,469
Alice, please sit,
if there's a seat.

86
00:04:20,554 --> 00:04:22,104
Bit of a transition.

87
00:04:22,189 --> 00:04:24,306
I find that I prefer an office
that I can reach

88
00:04:24,391 --> 00:04:26,141
without falling down
three flights of steps

89
00:04:26,227 --> 00:04:27,392
that I cannot see.

90
00:04:27,444 --> 00:04:29,278
This'll be quick, Alice.

91
00:04:29,363 --> 00:04:31,446
Show Professor March
what you can do.

92
00:04:36,153 --> 00:04:37,903
Like I said, I used to do
a lot of coin and card tricks,

93
00:04:37,955 --> 00:04:39,288
and I guess sometimes

94
00:04:39,373 --> 00:04:40,739
I, like, actually used
real magic.

95
00:04:40,824 --> 00:04:43,075
Predictions could mean psychic.

96
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,794
Vanishing could mean illusions
or physical magic.

97
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,746
Curious.

98
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:48,964
What? What's curious?

99
00:04:49,049 --> 00:04:51,133
Now, try holding these.

100
00:04:51,218 --> 00:04:55,003
Think the alphabet in Greek.

101
00:04:55,089 --> 00:04:56,305
No.

102
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:59,508
Just lovely, Miss Quinn.

103
00:04:59,593 --> 00:05:01,760
So clean.
Very advanced.

104
00:05:01,845 --> 00:05:03,145
- Physical magic.
- Hm.

105
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,763
Definitely.

106
00:05:17,194 --> 00:05:20,028
Just stare at it.

107
00:05:21,615 --> 00:05:23,699
Well, you're not an herbalist.

108
00:05:23,784 --> 00:05:26,335
Undetermined?
Can they do that?

109
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,370
Yeah, Sunderland said
it happens,

110
00:05:28,455 --> 00:05:31,790

try again next year.

Phosphoromancy.

I couldn't tell.

159
00:08:28,802 --> 00:08:30,635
You know, it should have worked.

160
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:34,523
That spell we did
to reach my brother.

161
00:08:34,608 --> 00:08:38,059
I mean, I went over it,
like, a million times.

162
00:08:38,145 --> 00:08:40,979
Should have?
You saying that like you...

163
00:08:41,064 --> 00:08:42,981
wanna do it again.

164
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:45,150
Wait, you don't wanna
try it again, do you?

165
00:08:45,235 --> 00:08:48,153
I need to know the truth,
that's all.

166
00:08:48,238 --> 00:08:51,823
You know, the spell
we did was, like...

167
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,825
I don't know,
it was like a phone call.

168
00:08:53,911 --> 00:08:56,878
We made contact,
but he didn't pick up,

169
00:08:56,964 --> 00:08:59,080
so then The Beast picked up.

170
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:00,332
But that still leaves
the question,

171
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:02,384
"Where's Charlie?"

172
00:09:02,469 --> 00:09:05,720
Well, the last time we asked
that question, somebody died.

173
00:09:05,806 --> 00:09:07,005
Never mind.

174
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,840
What do you care?

175
00:09:08,926 --> 00:09:11,560
No.

176
00:09:11,645 --> 00:09:13,562
I do. I care.
I wanna help.

177
00:09:13,647 --> 00:09:16,681
I just--I don't--

178
00:09:20,737 --> 00:09:21,937
Ooh, oh. Yeah.

179
00:09:22,022 --> 00:09:23,405
Um...

180
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:26,908
have you read Teukolsky yet?

181
00:09:26,994 --> 00:09:28,777
Uh, so apparently

182
00:09:28,862 --> 00:09:31,079
you can find deceased spirits

183
00:09:31,165 --> 00:09:32,864
with a simple locator spell.

184
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,533
If they wanna be found.

185
00:09:34,618 --> 00:09:37,285
That's stupid.

186
00:09:37,371 --> 00:09:40,338
You're stupid.
You have a stupid face.

187
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:45,427
Uh, anyone have a match?

188
00:09:45,512 --> 00:09:47,712
Uh, it's not working.

189
00:09:47,764 --> 00:09:49,714
Just keep walking.

190
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:56,388
Okay.
Finally.

191
00:09:58,058 --> 00:09:59,941
Guess it's Woof Fountain.

192
00:10:00,027 --> 00:10:03,061
Ugh. I never liked
this thing.

193
00:10:03,113 --> 00:10:05,780
Eliot says
it's enchanted as shit.

194
00:10:07,201 --> 00:10:10,118
Supposedly it's bottomless,

195
00:10:10,204 --> 00:10:11,486
so you know
the psychics love it.

196
00:10:11,572 --> 00:10:13,071
Suicide fountain.

197
00:10:13,123 --> 00:10:15,957
You don't think
your brother--

198
00:10:15,993 --> 00:10:17,709
No.

199
00:10:17,744 --> 00:10:19,044
He wasn't that kinda guy.

200
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:21,246
He was the kinda guy
who always wanted

201
00:10:21,248 --> 00:10:24,749
to fix things
for everyone around him.

202
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:27,719
He was really, really good.

203
00:10:27,804 --> 00:10:29,554
You know that spell I did
on the first day of class?

204
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,590
The Glass Horse?

205
00:10:31,725 --> 00:10:34,092
He taught me that.

206
00:10:47,324 --> 00:10:50,242
Come on, let's go.
Nothing's happening.

207
00:11:11,322 --> 00:11:13,029
The whole thing is fucking pointless.

208
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:14,601
Psychic?

209
00:11:14,687 --> 00:11:16,436
I wanna punch Sunderland
in the throat.

210
00:11:16,522 --> 00:11:18,105
You know, as a psychic,
you'd think

211
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,806
- you'd have seen all this coming.
- Oh, woman, please.

212
00:11:19,942 --> 00:11:21,475
Ah!

213
00:11:23,362 --> 00:11:24,978
Hold on.

214
00:11:28,317 --> 00:11:29,616
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa whoa.

215
00:11:29,702 --> 00:11:30,982
Are we actually
doing this again?

216
00:11:30,986 --> 00:11:32,347
Do you know how
to close your mind?

217
00:11:32,404 --> 00:11:34,154
'Cause I will show you
right now.

218
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:35,789
I thought I was.
Eliot gave me a--

219
00:11:35,874 --> 00:11:37,291
Seriously, man?

220
00:11:37,376 --> 00:11:39,159
Taylor Swift?

221
00:11:39,295 --> 00:11:41,211
I am not singing Taylor Swift

222
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,080
in my head.

223
00:11:47,586 --> 00:11:50,003
Okay, I'll work on it.

224
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:51,838
Jeez.

225
00:11:57,846 --> 00:12:01,315
So, it's got lots of space.
Lots of light.

226
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,851
It looks really great.

227
00:12:04,987 --> 00:12:06,903
I'm sorry, I guess
I thought you were still

228
00:12:07,022 --> 00:12:09,523
considering Yale
for the fall with me.

229
00:12:09,608 --> 00:12:10,857
What?

230
00:12:10,943 --> 00:12:13,910
Okay, can we just
talk about this now?

231
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:15,362
Where is your head?

232
00:12:15,497 --> 00:12:17,864
Why do I feel like
I'm talking to myself?

233
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,500
I'm--I've just been busy
with class--

234
00:12:20,586 --> 00:12:21,786
Are you seeing someone else?

235
00:12:21,837 --> 00:12:23,704
No! Why would you
ask that?

236
00:12:23,789 --> 00:12:25,422
Because you're different.

237
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:27,874
You stand me up.
You don't answer your phone.

238
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,377
I'm just--I'm starting
to feel like the asshole.

239
00:12:30,512 --> 00:12:32,879
You're not.

240
00:12:34,466 --> 00:12:37,184
Hey...

241
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:39,219
I love you.

242
00:12:39,355 --> 00:12:42,222
You know that.

243
00:12:42,307 --> 00:12:44,224
Look, I know
I've been moody lately,

244
00:12:44,309 --> 00:12:45,392
but...

245
00:12:45,527 --> 00:12:48,445
I feel a lot better.

246
00:12:48,564 --> 00:12:51,231
James, come on.

247
00:12:53,736 --> 00:12:55,619
Hey.

248
00:12:57,373 --> 00:12:58,905
Mm.

249
00:13:00,292 --> 00:13:01,458
Okay, go on.

250
00:13:01,577 --> 00:13:02,876
Someone killed themselves
in the fountain?

251
00:13:02,961 --> 00:13:04,911
Try 15 students and one dean.

252
00:13:04,997 --> 00:13:08,248
Van Pelt.
Fountain's named after him.

253
00:13:08,384 --> 00:13:12,135
It does feel a little bit off
here though, doesn't it?

254
00:13:16,425 --> 00:13:18,258
Brief announcement.

255
00:13:18,394 --> 00:13:22,262
The Van Pelt fountain is
temporarily off limits.

256
00:13:22,347 --> 00:13:23,764
There's been an incursion.

257
00:13:26,235 --> 00:13:30,437
We believe it's
a garden variety haunting.

258
00:13:30,572 --> 00:13:33,940
Redrawing the wards
may have released it

259
00:13:34,026 --> 00:13:36,443
much like a mouse caught
in the walls of a building.

260
00:13:36,528 --> 00:13:37,778
Help!

261
00:13:37,913 --> 00:13:40,280
No one was seriously hurt.

262
00:13:40,365 --> 00:13:42,416
Both students involved
are recuperating

263
00:13:42,501 --> 00:13:44,618
in the infirmary.

264
00:13:44,703 --> 00:13:46,336
Regardless,

265
00:13:46,455 --> 00:13:50,207
stay away until we lock it down.

266
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,293
Ow. I mean,
what if it was Charlie?

267
00:13:53,378 --> 00:13:55,512
I don't know.
Maybe.

268
00:13:55,631 --> 00:13:59,132
If not, it's
a pretty big coincidence.

269
00:13:59,218 --> 00:14:00,467
But if it was Charlie,
don't you think

270
00:14:00,602 --> 00:14:01,802
that he would have
reached out to you

271
00:14:01,887 --> 00:14:03,186
directly...

272
00:14:06,108 --> 00:14:08,024
Maybe he just did.

273
00:14:14,599 --> 00:14:16,041
It's definitely Charlie.

274
00:14:17,501 --> 00:14:18,884
Okay.

275
00:14:21,972 --> 00:14:24,089
So, why would he try
and drown a bunch of psychics.

276
00:14:24,224 --> 00:14:26,925
Uh, have you met them?

277
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,895
Are you two talking about
what happened at Woof?

278
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,814
I--that was
a private conversation.

279
00:14:32,933 --> 00:14:35,767
= You know.
Well, meow.

280
00:14:39,656 --> 00:14:40,989
What was that?

281
00:14:41,108 --> 00:14:43,441
I just--I don't trust her.

282
00:14:43,527 --> 00:14:46,444
Okay, look.
I just--

283
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:49,114
I think trying to drown people
seems a little violent.

284
00:14:49,249 --> 00:14:51,009
He may not have even
known what he was doing.

285
00:14:51,084 --> 00:14:53,251
I mean, spirits,
they can get confused.

286
00:14:53,337 --> 00:14:54,658
Okay, then how do we talk to him

287
00:14:54,705 --> 00:14:57,789
without him trying to drown us?

288
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,792
I don't know.

289
00:15:00,928 --> 00:15:02,794
But first thing's first.
I found a spell--

290
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,796
well, five actually, but they
all have their own down side.

291
00:15:04,882 --> 00:15:06,602
Like, we don't know
how Charlie died exactly

292
00:15:06,683 --> 00:15:07,933
and the moon is
in the wrong spot right now.

293
00:15:08,018 --> 00:15:09,601
Look, I know
you don't trust her,

294
00:15:09,686 --> 00:15:11,469
- but maybe Margo could--
- Or there's a Maori spell.

295
00:15:11,605 --> 00:15:13,972
I'd have to cut off a finger,
but they might be preferable.

296
00:15:14,107 --> 00:15:15,857
To talking to Margo?

297
00:15:15,976 --> 00:15:19,694
Quentin, I need your help.
Highest priority.

298
00:15:19,813 --> 00:15:21,780
- Let's go.
- Okay.

299
00:15:21,865 --> 00:15:23,782
I--hey, look,
you said it yourself,

300
00:15:23,867 --> 00:15:25,027
you don't have all the facts,

301
00:15:25,118 --> 00:15:26,484
so maybe you don't need a spell.

302
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,869
Maybe you need information,

303
00:15:27,988 --> 00:15:31,873
and Margo's Discipline
is gossip, so...

304
00:15:41,885 --> 00:15:44,386
We have a real problem.

305
00:15:44,504 --> 00:15:45,720
Is it in the box?

306
00:15:47,307 --> 00:15:49,174
Professor Sunderland
came looking for a book

307
00:15:49,309 --> 00:15:51,343
from the Physical
Cottage Library,

308
00:15:51,428 --> 00:15:53,061
and it's missing.

309
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,380
I diverted
her attention, but--

310
00:15:54,431 --> 00:15:55,680
What does that have to do with the box?

311
00:15:55,816 --> 00:15:57,983
Books at Brakebills, Quentin,

312
00:15:58,068 --> 00:15:59,184
are not just books.

313
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:00,518
One goes missing, it's not just

314
00:16:00,654 --> 00:16:02,320
a library fine
we're talking about here.

315
00:16:02,406 --> 00:16:04,739
- What're we talking about?
- We're talking about--

316
00:16:04,858 --> 00:16:07,192
we have...

317
00:16:07,327 --> 00:16:09,027
occasional parties.

318
00:16:09,112 --> 00:16:10,695
During one, someone took a book,

319
00:16:10,831 --> 00:16:12,414
and if we don't find that book

320
00:16:12,532 --> 00:16:14,532
the faculty are going to take
a harder look at our parties,

321
00:16:14,618 --> 00:16:16,284
and that cannot happen, Quentin.

322
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:21,873
So you gonna tell me
what's in the box or...

323
00:16:26,296 --> 00:16:28,096
What the hell is that?

324
00:16:28,215 --> 00:16:29,714
The missing book is Volume One.

325
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:33,301
That...is Volume Two.

326
00:16:35,605 --> 00:16:38,890
She's going to lead us
to her mate.

327
00:16:38,976 --> 00:16:40,725
Oh.

328
00:16:40,861 --> 00:16:43,478
<i>Odemknout.</i>

329
00:16:46,616 --> 00:16:48,566
<i>Odemknout.</i>

330
00:16:48,652 --> 00:16:50,035
Shit.

331
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,903
Uh, let me--
let me try it again.

332
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:54,873
Should be easy.
You're distracted.

333
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,791
I know I have a lot going on.

334
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,271
No, you don't.
You have this spell.

335
00:16:58,328 --> 00:16:59,911
That's it.

336
00:17:01,915 --> 00:17:05,083
So how do you manage it all?

337
00:17:05,168 --> 00:17:08,253
Juggling magic and your life?

338
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:12,557
I don't understand the question.

339
00:17:12,642 --> 00:17:14,259
I'm not judging you.

340
00:17:14,394 --> 00:17:17,812
I started out like you
and you have a good life.

341
00:17:17,931 --> 00:17:19,731
Boyfriend.

342
00:17:19,816 --> 00:17:21,933
Probably think
he keeps you centered.

343
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:23,985
- Right?
- Kinda.

344
00:17:24,104 --> 00:17:27,939
Or, you know, you're keeping
him around in case you fail here

345
00:17:28,075 --> 00:17:30,775
and need to fall back.

346
00:17:30,861 --> 00:17:33,611
All I know...
you have to mean it

347
00:17:33,747 --> 00:17:35,080
for magic to work.

348
00:17:35,165 --> 00:17:38,750
Something clicks
when you're all-in,

349
00:17:38,835 --> 00:17:43,455
and the real big stuff,
you can't do it

350
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,674
till you're doing it
without a net.

351
00:17:59,639 --> 00:18:02,307
I...

352
00:18:02,442 --> 00:18:03,775
I need your help.

353
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,978
That wasn't so hard, was it?

354
00:18:08,982 --> 00:18:10,532
Look, I'm just trying

355
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:12,484
to find out what happened
to my brother.

356
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:14,986
He was a student here
five years ago.

357
00:18:15,122 --> 00:18:16,871
Okay.

358
00:18:19,993 --> 00:18:22,160
He was a physical kid.

359
00:18:22,245 --> 00:18:24,712
His name was Charlie,

360
00:18:24,831 --> 00:18:26,164
and he died.

361
00:18:26,249 --> 00:18:30,135
Know what?
I did hear about that.

362
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,303
At Woof, right?

363
00:18:32,389 --> 00:18:35,673
Five, six years back?

364
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:37,475
It's all making sense now.

365
00:18:37,561 --> 00:18:39,644
- What is?
- You.

366
00:18:39,729 --> 00:18:41,479
The awkward thing.

367
00:18:41,565 --> 00:18:44,682
The anger underneath
the ineffable air of tragedy

368
00:18:44,818 --> 00:18:47,352
you wear like a perfume.

369
00:18:49,272 --> 00:18:52,240
Look, can you just tell me
what you know about Charlie?

370
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:54,325
- Please?
- Loathe as I am to admit it,

371
00:18:54,411 --> 00:18:58,079
I don't actually know anything.

372
00:18:58,198 --> 00:19:00,165
Although, there was a girl

373
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,700
from Charlie's year who might.

374
00:19:02,786 --> 00:19:05,203
Emily Greenstreet.

375
00:19:05,338 --> 00:19:06,704
Who was she?

376
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,173
Just a girl.

377
00:19:08,258 --> 00:19:10,842
When he died,
apparently she took it hard.

378
00:19:10,927 --> 00:19:12,760
Dropped out.
Gave up magic.

379
00:19:12,879 --> 00:19:14,345
The Full Muggle.

380
00:19:14,431 --> 00:19:16,214
It was a bit of a scandal.

381
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:17,599
Where is she now?

382
00:19:17,717 --> 00:19:18,850
The city.

383
00:19:18,935 --> 00:19:20,385
Fogg set her up with a job

384
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,721
which is how you know
they're hiding something big.

385
00:19:23,857 --> 00:19:25,940
I know how to find her.

386
00:19:26,059 --> 00:19:27,392
Come on, I'll show you.

387
00:19:27,477 --> 00:19:29,861
I'd actually prefer to go alone.

388
00:19:29,946 --> 00:19:33,114
Oh, I know you would, but...

389
00:19:33,233 --> 00:19:35,233
what choice do you really have?

390
00:19:46,163 --> 00:19:48,546
Penny.

391
00:19:48,632 --> 00:19:51,916
Welcome.
Knew you were coming.

392
00:19:52,052 --> 00:19:53,635
I know you've been
dreading this,

393
00:19:53,753 --> 00:19:55,970
but you're gonna like it.

394
00:19:56,089 --> 00:19:59,224
The coves are for meditation

395
00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:01,926
while the enclosed
"Consciousness Areas"

396
00:20:02,012 --> 00:20:05,480
are reserved as a place
to cry, and process.

397
00:20:08,485 --> 00:20:09,934
Hm.

398
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,270
We call it "The Amplifier."

399
00:20:12,355 --> 00:20:14,405
So basically, it's like turning

400
00:20:14,491 --> 00:20:16,491
your psychic powers up to 11.

401
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:18,109
Why would you wanna do that?

402
00:20:18,245 --> 00:20:19,777
Oh, I get it.

403
00:20:19,913 --> 00:20:22,247
You're one of those guys
who's trying to shut it out.

404
00:20:22,332 --> 00:20:24,449
You wanna get control of it

405
00:20:24,534 --> 00:20:27,952
or it will mess up your shit
big time,

406
00:20:28,088 --> 00:20:29,954
and this is the best place
to practice.

407
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,507
So...

408
00:20:32,626 --> 00:20:33,758
I do what?

409
00:20:33,843 --> 00:20:34,959
Sit.

410
00:20:35,045 --> 00:20:36,261
Relax.

411
00:20:36,346 --> 00:20:37,962
Let your mind wander.

412
00:20:38,048 --> 00:20:39,297
It's pretty simple.

413
00:20:39,432 --> 00:20:41,683
But you gotta start
by letting go, tough guy.

414
00:20:41,801 --> 00:20:44,519
Less talking.

415
00:20:44,638 --> 00:20:45,803
No touching.

416
00:21:13,717 --> 00:21:15,383
<i>Help!</i>

417
00:21:15,502 --> 00:21:17,885
<i>Please!</i>
<i>Help me!</i>

418
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,453
Emily?

419
00:21:31,906 --> 00:21:33,239
No, don't run.

420
00:21:33,324 --> 00:21:34,907
These shoes are insane.

421
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:40,613
You're from Brakebills,
aren't you?

422
00:21:41,065 --> 00:21:42,632
That part of my life
is behind me.

423
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:45,468
- I'm sorry.
- Charlie was my brother.

424
00:21:51,885 --> 00:21:55,387
I just wanna know
what happened to him.

425
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:58,857
Your brother saved my life.

426
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:02,060
Well, he tried to at least.

427
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:05,230
So, I fell for this professor.

428
00:22:05,315 --> 00:22:07,565
I know how it sounds,

429
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:10,568
but I was young and...

430
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,571
and he loved me.

431
00:22:13,657 --> 00:22:17,459
But then, well, he was married.

432
00:22:17,577 --> 00:22:19,577
You know how it is
when you're that age.

433
00:22:19,663 --> 00:22:22,964
You get...terrible ideas.

434
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:25,550
Hmm.

435
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:27,802
Like what?

436
00:22:27,921 --> 00:22:31,589
I thought I could
make him love me again.

437
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,758
Oh, some kind of love spell?

438
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:36,928
No.

439
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,813
No.

440
00:22:38,932 --> 00:22:43,735
I thought if I could
make myself prettier.

441
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,321
Oh...God.

442
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,606
No one warned you
how dangerous that was?

443
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:51,576
I knew, but I'd convinced myself

444
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:56,247
that it was the only way.

445
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:59,117
It took me weeks

446
00:22:59,202 --> 00:23:01,920
to figure out how to do it,

447
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:04,622
and...

448
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:07,092
<i>when I did, well, you--</i>

449
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,793
<i>you can imagine how that went.</i>

450
00:23:16,636 --> 00:23:19,304
No...

451
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:30,482
I was gonna--I was
gonna kill myself.

452
00:23:30,567 --> 00:23:33,284
Emily!

453
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:35,453
Wait!

454
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,655
What happened?

455
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,657
What did you do?

456
00:23:44,998 --> 00:23:47,165
Please.

457
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,001
I just wanna help.

458
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:04,149
Don't tell anyone, please.

459
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,483
Course not.

460
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,068
Wait here.
I'll be back.

461
00:24:07,187 --> 00:24:08,686
I'm gonna fix this.

462
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,909
He mashed a...

463
00:24:15,028 --> 00:24:16,361
bunch of stuff together.

464
00:24:16,446 --> 00:24:18,196
<i>It was--</i>

465
00:24:18,281 --> 00:24:19,747
<i>It was totally untested.</i>

466
00:24:21,785 --> 00:24:24,035
I really believed

467
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:27,205
he might actually
be able to undo what I did.

468
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,341
He was a good magician.

469
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,544
You know, he--

470
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:36,598
he woulda done anything for me.

471
00:24:36,716 --> 00:24:38,716
<i>It was a lot.</i>
<i>It was--it was--</i>

472
00:24:38,802 --> 00:24:41,719
It was too much.

473
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:45,773
I begged him to stop,
but he wouldn't,

474
00:24:45,892 --> 00:24:49,227
and that's when it went
totally out of control.

475
00:24:59,656 --> 00:25:01,956
It burned...

476
00:25:02,075 --> 00:25:05,210
right through him...

477
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:09,714
until he wasn't there anymore.

478
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:13,218
He was--
Do you know what a Niffin is?

479
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:17,422
- No.
- Yes.

480
00:25:17,507 --> 00:25:19,390
It's when too much
runs through you.

481
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,593
Consumes you.

482
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:24,646
Only the magic is left,

483
00:25:24,764 --> 00:25:27,599
but you're not

484
00:25:27,684 --> 00:25:28,816
you anymore.

485
00:25:28,935 --> 00:25:31,152
You're...

486
00:25:31,271 --> 00:25:34,105
lost.

487
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,608
Where did Charlie go?

488
00:25:36,693 --> 00:25:38,076
I don't know.

489
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:42,080
He was just gone.

490
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,449
I never saw him again.

491
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:47,285
Um, who did all this then?

492
00:25:49,539 --> 00:25:51,673
My professor.

493
00:25:51,791 --> 00:25:54,959
Well, I guess you got
his attention after all.

494
00:25:55,045 --> 00:25:56,344
I quit school.

495
00:25:56,463 --> 00:25:58,930
Gave up magic,
and never looked back.

496
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:03,551
I'm so sorry about Charlie.

497
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:11,309
Hear that?
She's getting excited.

498
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,645
I think we're close.

499
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:16,064
Hold this, will you?

500
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:23,988
This bodega is warded
up the ass.

501
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:28,993
Hedge witches.

502
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:31,663
Amateurs.
Magical D-leaguers.

503
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,998
Sad and desperate people.

504
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,968
Once one of 'em offered
to blow me for a spell.

505
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:39,470
It was fairly worth it.

506
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,838
Let me do the talking.

507
00:27:05,198 --> 00:27:06,364
These are witches?

508
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:08,750
Hm. Pathetic. No?

509
00:27:08,868 --> 00:27:12,704
Ugh, this kid's trying
Popper number four.

510
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,956
It's painful.

511
00:27:19,963 --> 00:27:21,462
Hear you're selling something.

512
00:27:23,883 --> 00:27:25,850
Quentin?

513
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:28,052
Oh, hey.

514
00:27:33,411 --> 00:27:35,404
- What the hell are you doing here?
- What the hell are you doing here?

515
00:27:35,524 --> 00:27:37,157
You know these guys?

516
00:27:37,276 --> 00:27:38,556
Yeah, they're from Brakebills.

517
00:27:38,577 --> 00:27:39,660
- We're friends.
- That's right.

518
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:40,903
We're from Brakebills.

519
00:27:41,023 --> 00:27:44,081
We're classically trained
and we want our book.

520
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:46,917
We don't have your stupid book.

521
00:27:58,297 --> 00:28:00,130
Are they?

522
00:28:01,517 --> 00:28:02,933
Yep.

523
00:28:03,018 --> 00:28:04,218
Love wins.

524
00:28:18,401 --> 00:28:19,867
Hey!

525
00:28:19,985 --> 00:28:21,201
So, that's it?

526
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,486
That's all you're
gonna say to me?

527
00:28:22,571 --> 00:28:24,154
Don't talk to her.
Keep going.

528
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:26,290
I don't know what
you're doing here, Jules.

529
00:28:26,375 --> 00:28:28,125
You're better than this.

530
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,877
You say that
like I had a choice.

531
00:28:29,995 --> 00:28:31,328
- Of course you have a choice.
- No, because guess what?

532
00:28:31,464 --> 00:28:34,214
Magic wasn't just handed to me.

533
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:38,368
I told you to please
tell them about me.

534
00:28:38,471 --> 00:28:40,170
At first, you know,
I thought maybe

535
00:28:40,256 --> 00:28:42,306
they'd actually test me again,

536
00:28:42,391 --> 00:28:43,974
and then I figured someone
would at least come

537
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:47,010
and try to take my memory
again, and then...

538
00:28:47,096 --> 00:28:49,680
just waiting.

539
00:28:49,815 --> 00:28:51,181
It took me weeks to realize

540
00:28:51,267 --> 00:28:55,152
you never even
told them about me at all.

541
00:28:55,237 --> 00:28:57,905
- Look, Jules, I--
- You were my best friend.

542
00:28:58,023 --> 00:29:00,691
Yeah, and so I let it go.

543
00:29:00,776 --> 00:29:03,160
What does that mean,
"you let it go?"

544
00:29:03,245 --> 00:29:04,862
No, that's crazy,
I can actually do--

545
00:29:04,997 --> 00:29:07,414
The people at Brakebills,
Jules, they can bend light.

546
00:29:07,533 --> 00:29:09,082
They can read minds.
They can fly.

547
00:29:09,201 --> 00:29:11,335
You can do a party trick.

548
00:29:14,457 --> 00:29:16,423
So this is it, huh?

549
00:29:16,542 --> 00:29:18,258
The real you.

550
00:29:18,377 --> 00:29:21,044
Do you ever stop to think
about how maybe you treated me?

551
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,713
What?

552
00:29:22,848 --> 00:29:24,264
I was always there--

553
00:29:24,383 --> 00:29:26,184
What? You were so nice
and you were so sweet

554
00:29:26,268 --> 00:29:29,219
to poor little Q who couldn't
get his shit together.

555
00:29:29,305 --> 00:29:31,054
- Don't put that on me.
- Between you and James it was

556
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,723
- a two for one charity case.
- That's your interpretation.

557
00:29:32,808 --> 00:29:34,558
- Why are you saying this?
- Because that is true, Julia!

558
00:29:34,643 --> 00:29:38,529
- No, that's not true. I--
- You know how I felt about you.

559
00:29:38,614 --> 00:29:40,280
- I don't know what--
- Admit it. Just admit it.

560
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,316
Admit it.

561
00:29:45,237 --> 00:29:47,070
So, you're gonna
punish me for that?

562
00:29:47,206 --> 00:29:49,072
I don't know what else to say.

563
00:29:49,208 --> 00:29:52,209
You can't blame me.

564
00:29:52,294 --> 00:29:54,711
Does James even
know that you're here?

565
00:29:54,797 --> 00:29:56,246
You're hanging out
with a bunch of tweakers

566
00:29:56,332 --> 00:29:57,653
who are turning tricks
for spells.

567
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,082
Are you kidding me?
These people wanna--

568
00:29:59,218 --> 00:30:00,417
Stop slumming
because you're pissed

569
00:30:00,553 --> 00:30:02,336
that you lost
for once in your life.

570
00:30:05,508 --> 00:30:08,058
I'm sorry, but I mean it.

571
00:30:08,143 --> 00:30:09,593
You could really get hurt
doing this shit,

572
00:30:09,678 --> 00:30:12,729
and for what?

573
00:30:12,815 --> 00:30:16,149
Grow up.

574
00:30:16,268 --> 00:30:18,185
Do you love magic?

575
00:30:20,856 --> 00:30:22,856
Is it in your soul?

576
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:30,280
Is it like the secret heart
of what you always were?

577
00:30:33,669 --> 00:30:36,503
Yeah.

578
00:30:36,622 --> 00:30:39,339
So you know how I feel.

579
00:31:12,157 --> 00:31:14,491
Get in.

580
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:25,135
Penny, how's your head?

581
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,554
How you think?

582
00:31:30,092 --> 00:31:31,475
So, what's wrong with me?

583
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,010
Nothing's wrong.

584
00:31:33,145 --> 00:31:35,312
I made the mistake of thinking
you were just psychic,

585
00:31:35,397 --> 00:31:38,515
but it...
it's more complicated.

586
00:31:38,651 --> 00:31:42,069
You are a Traveller.

587
00:31:42,187 --> 00:31:44,738
A what now?

588
00:31:44,857 --> 00:31:46,189
The rarest

589
00:31:46,275 --> 00:31:47,991
and most difficult Discipline.

590
00:31:48,077 --> 00:31:49,993
Travellers can,
with a little bit of training,

591
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,912
go anywhere on Earth instantly

592
00:31:52,031 --> 00:31:53,497
just as you did.

593
00:31:53,582 --> 00:31:57,534
But you can, with a great
deal of training,

594
00:31:57,670 --> 00:32:01,171
actually move between worlds.

595
00:32:01,256 --> 00:32:03,373
- Go to other worlds?
- Yes.

596
00:32:03,459 --> 00:32:06,760
If the gift
does not kill you first.

597
00:32:06,879 --> 00:32:10,047
Great. Just fucking great.

598
00:32:10,132 --> 00:32:13,216
Do you know why I'm here?

599
00:32:13,352 --> 00:32:14,718
To say this.

600
00:32:14,853 --> 00:32:16,853
You've been a thin layer
of insouciance

601
00:32:16,939 --> 00:32:20,273
over an open pit of self-pity
your entire life.

602
00:32:20,392 --> 00:32:22,192
This is not a joke.

603
00:32:22,277 --> 00:32:23,894
You do not have the luxury
to mess around

604
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:25,562
now that this is
out of the bottle.

605
00:32:25,698 --> 00:32:27,564
You will study this.
You will master this.

606
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:29,066
Do you understand?

607
00:32:29,151 --> 00:32:31,902
Ain't you a bucket of empathy,
blind man.

608
00:32:32,037 --> 00:32:34,705
Please say yes.

609
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:38,241
I cannot see you nod.

610
00:32:38,377 --> 00:32:40,293
Fine.

611
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:43,330
Yes.

612
00:32:45,584 --> 00:32:48,135
So, are we just gonna drive
all the way back to Brakebills?

613
00:32:48,253 --> 00:32:51,138
We're already there.

614
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:03,984
Penny.

615
00:33:04,103 --> 00:33:06,236
I've learned a great deal

616
00:33:06,321 --> 00:33:07,988
about Travelling over the years.

617
00:33:08,107 --> 00:33:09,906
We'll start one-on-one tutorials

618
00:33:09,992 --> 00:33:11,825
to help you get
a handle on your ability.

619
00:33:11,944 --> 00:33:13,276
Yes,

620
00:33:13,412 --> 00:33:16,113
before you accidentally
transport yourself

621
00:33:16,198 --> 00:33:19,616
inside a volcano.

622
00:33:29,628 --> 00:33:31,795
She's right.

623
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:33,130
We were best friends.

624
00:33:35,184 --> 00:33:36,800
- Should we help?
- No.

625
00:33:36,885 --> 00:33:39,186
<i>Let me in, you assholes!</i>

626
00:33:39,304 --> 00:33:43,140
I don't know what happened.
I don't know how it got so bad.

627
00:33:43,225 --> 00:33:45,142
You found out who you are

628
00:33:45,277 --> 00:33:47,861
and she found out who she's not.

629
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,112
Life.

630
00:33:52,484 --> 00:33:55,318
Tell you what.

631
00:33:55,454 --> 00:33:58,488
Let's not talk.

632
00:34:01,293 --> 00:34:03,160
Shit!

633
00:34:05,748 --> 00:34:08,498
How long were you to douchebags
gonna leave me out there?

634
00:34:08,634 --> 00:34:11,635
Oh, never mind that.

635
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,721
Now you're with your people.

636
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,390
Cheers to that.

637
00:34:17,509 --> 00:34:20,060
Good God.

638
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:25,265
Cheers.

639
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:30,372
So, this Niffin box?

640
00:34:32,312 --> 00:34:34,346
- This have a lid?
- There isn't one.

641
00:34:34,481 --> 00:34:35,730
The Niffin becomes
fused with the wood.

642
00:34:35,849 --> 00:34:37,399
It's unable to escape.

643
00:34:37,517 --> 00:34:39,568
- How do you activate it?
- There's a short chant.

644
00:34:39,686 --> 00:34:41,186
You just basically repeat
"I bind you"

645
00:34:41,271 --> 00:34:42,571
in Turkish and English.

646
00:34:42,689 --> 00:34:44,155
That sounds a little easy.

647
00:34:44,241 --> 00:34:45,991
Well, that and the
month long incantation it took

648
00:34:46,076 --> 00:34:47,692
to enchant the thing
in the first place.

649
00:34:47,828 --> 00:34:51,363
So, this is
the enchantment research?

650
00:34:51,498 --> 00:34:53,999
We're not gonna use the box.

651
00:34:54,084 --> 00:34:56,334
What?

652
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,003
We're gonna bring Charlie back.

653
00:34:58,088 --> 00:35:00,705
Okay, Alice this is the point

654
00:35:00,791 --> 00:35:03,675
where I look at you
like you're nuts.

655
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,543
I--okay, look.

656
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:07,045
I've been doing some research,

657
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,931
um, on Niffins.

658
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,216
Look, they're not even alive.

659
00:35:11,301 --> 00:35:13,685
Th--they're...
something else.

660
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:15,387
Look, I can't explain it,

661
00:35:15,522 --> 00:35:17,389
but I know that he's out there.
He's somewhere.

662
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:18,607
Is there anything
in the literature that says

663
00:35:18,725 --> 00:35:20,108
that going Niffin is reversible?

664
00:35:20,227 --> 00:35:21,893
Nothing says that it isn't.

665
00:35:22,029 --> 00:35:23,895
Exactly.

666
00:35:24,031 --> 00:35:25,897
So I found this spell
that can transmutate

667
00:35:25,983 --> 00:35:29,401
certain meta-quantum energies
into matter...in theory.

668
00:35:29,536 --> 00:35:31,236
And I combined it with an
advanced transformation ritual--

669
00:35:31,371 --> 00:35:32,704
Alice, this is Major Arcana--

670
00:35:32,789 --> 00:35:34,072
What? Just because
you couldn't do it?

671
00:35:34,207 --> 00:35:35,540
Nobody could do it.

672
00:35:35,626 --> 00:35:36,741
You're making it up
as you go along.

673
00:35:36,827 --> 00:35:38,543
Look, I--

674
00:35:38,629 --> 00:35:40,745
- You are an amazing magician--
- Don't patronize me.

675
00:35:40,831 --> 00:35:42,130
I'm not patronizing you.
I'm telling you that

676
00:35:42,249 --> 00:35:44,382
- this is not a good idea.
- What do you know?

677
00:35:44,468 --> 00:35:46,084
Hmm?

678
00:35:46,219 --> 00:35:47,385
You only learned
about magic, what?

679
00:35:47,471 --> 00:35:49,254
- Three months ago?
- Okay, sure.

680
00:35:49,389 --> 00:35:51,089
I--but even I can tell
that this is crazy.

681
00:35:51,174 --> 00:35:52,891
I don't understand
why you can't see that.

682
00:35:52,976 --> 00:35:55,093
Fine. Stay behind.

683
00:35:55,228 --> 00:35:56,478
I'm here, and I'm only here,
to find out

684
00:35:56,596 --> 00:35:57,812
what happened to Charlie,

685
00:35:57,931 --> 00:35:59,252
and now that I know
I can help him

686
00:35:59,316 --> 00:36:01,066
I'm going to.

687
00:36:18,869 --> 00:36:21,252
Thanks for coming so quick.

688
00:36:21,338 --> 00:36:23,955
I was kinda surprised
you called.

689
00:36:24,041 --> 00:36:26,124
Thought you disappeared again.

690
00:36:26,259 --> 00:36:28,093
You okay?

691
00:36:29,379 --> 00:36:31,963
You wanna talk about it?

692
00:36:32,049 --> 00:36:34,349
Please?

693
00:36:34,468 --> 00:36:36,434
- Last call, Julia.
- I--

694
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,854
I don't know
how to talk about it.

695
00:36:42,526 --> 00:36:45,727
I got involved with something.

696
00:36:47,147 --> 00:36:50,648
Made me wanna
give up everything.

697
00:36:50,734 --> 00:36:52,784
Life, school...

698
00:36:52,869 --> 00:36:56,621
all of it.

699
00:36:56,707 --> 00:36:59,324
It got under my skin,

700
00:36:59,409 --> 00:37:01,376
and it--

701
00:37:01,495 --> 00:37:05,330
And?

702
00:37:05,415 --> 00:37:08,166
Jules, just tell me.

703
00:37:10,921 --> 00:37:13,888
It's Adderall.

704
00:37:14,007 --> 00:37:16,558
I started taking it

705
00:37:16,676 --> 00:37:18,176
when I was applying
to grad school,

706
00:37:18,311 --> 00:37:21,646
and then I was taking
more and more.

707
00:37:21,732 --> 00:37:25,400
I know I've been a bitch,

708
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:28,686
but lately I've been
going to meetings.

709
00:37:30,524 --> 00:37:32,690
Wow.

710
00:37:38,865 --> 00:37:41,032
I--

711
00:37:41,118 --> 00:37:42,751
Can I--

712
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:45,086
I don't know, can I hug you?

713
00:37:45,205 --> 00:37:48,039
I wish you would.

714
00:37:49,709 --> 00:37:52,427
It's okay, Jules.

715
00:37:52,546 --> 00:37:55,046
I really love you, you know.

716
00:37:55,132 --> 00:37:57,348
I know.
I'm amazing.

717
00:38:25,629 --> 00:38:28,963
Okay, so, we're here, and...

718
00:38:29,082 --> 00:38:31,633
Arrive at the place
of his transformation.

719
00:38:31,751 --> 00:38:35,637
Present yourself.

720
00:38:35,755 --> 00:38:37,589
There's a third step.

721
00:38:37,674 --> 00:38:40,758
What's the third step?

722
00:38:40,894 --> 00:38:44,762
I have to call in to him with
something personal between us,

723
00:38:44,848 --> 00:38:47,232
um...

724
00:38:47,317 --> 00:38:49,934
so Charlie used to sing to me
my favorite song

725
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,603
when I was feeling bad

726
00:38:51,738 --> 00:38:53,521
which is kind of all the time.

727
00:38:59,329 --> 00:39:02,497
♪ Won't you come see about me ♪

728
00:39:02,616 --> 00:39:04,782
Is that "The Breakfast Club"?

729
00:39:04,918 --> 00:39:07,619
♪ I'll be alone dancing ♪

730
00:39:07,754 --> 00:39:09,954
♪ You know it, baby ♪

731
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:14,125
♪ Tell me your troubles
and doubts ♪

732
00:39:14,211 --> 00:39:19,430
♪ Giving me everything
inside and out ♪

733
00:39:19,516 --> 00:39:24,269
♪ Don't you forget about me ♪

734
00:39:24,354 --> 00:39:27,472
♪ Don't, don't, don't, don't ♪

735
00:39:27,607 --> 00:39:30,391
Alice, look.

736
00:39:36,816 --> 00:39:42,537
Charlie, Charlie?

737
00:39:51,131 --> 00:39:53,464
- Charlie, is that you?
- Alice.

738
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:57,335
Oh, my God, Charlie,
I can't believe it's you.

739
00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:02,507
I missed you so much.
I don't even know what to say.

740
00:40:02,642 --> 00:40:05,843
Charlie, what are you doing?

741
00:40:05,929 --> 00:40:06,844
Charlie, you're hurting me.

742
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:08,813
Charlie, that hurts.

743
00:40:11,985 --> 00:40:13,851
You're just confused,
Charlie, it's me.

744
00:40:16,907 --> 00:40:19,857
Charlie--Charlie,
why are you doing this?

745
00:40:19,993 --> 00:40:21,693
Why?

746
00:40:21,828 --> 00:40:23,027
Alice, I don't think--
I don't think that we should--

747
00:40:23,163 --> 00:40:24,028
I know you're in there, Charlie.

748
00:40:24,164 --> 00:40:25,580
- I know it's you.
- Alice!

749
00:40:25,699 --> 00:40:28,366
Hah!

750
00:40:28,451 --> 00:40:32,420
Charlie, stop!
I can help you.

751
00:40:41,631 --> 00:40:43,264
Alice, stop!

752
00:40:52,726 --> 00:40:54,442
Alice, he's gonna kill us.
It's not gonna work.

753
00:40:54,561 --> 00:40:56,194
- You have to stop.
- Shut up, I can do this.

754
00:40:56,279 --> 00:40:57,779
Alice, it's not Charlie.

755
00:41:00,233 --> 00:41:01,616
Oh, shit.
Shit.

756
00:41:04,454 --> 00:41:08,539
<i>Emrediyorum!</i>

757
00:41:08,625 --> 00:41:13,127
Alice, stop!
You're gonna kill yourself.

758
00:41:13,246 --> 00:41:14,912
You are bound and held fast.

759
00:41:15,048 --> 00:41:16,914
<i>Seni baglamak!</i>

760
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:18,132
No!
No!

761
00:41:18,251 --> 00:41:20,969
I bind you!
<i>Seni baglamak.</i>

762
00:41:21,087 --> 00:41:22,136
- No!
- I bind you!

763
00:41:22,255 --> 00:41:24,472
<i>Seni baglamak.</i>

764
00:41:32,515 --> 00:41:36,818
You--you brought the box.

765
00:41:36,936 --> 00:41:40,271
Yeah.

766
00:41:40,407 --> 00:41:42,156
Alice, he was gonna kill you.

767
00:41:42,275 --> 00:41:45,827
Why did you think
you had to save me?

768
00:41:45,945 --> 00:41:48,579
Fuck you, Quentin.

769
00:41:48,665 --> 00:41:51,115
You had no idea
what I was doing.

770
00:41:51,201 --> 00:41:54,786
I was so close,
and now he's gone.

771
00:42:18,695 --> 00:42:20,478
Where you going, kitty cat?

772
00:42:20,613 --> 00:42:22,814
I'm done here.
For good.

773
00:42:22,949 --> 00:42:24,615
You should be happy.
Less competition.

774
00:42:24,701 --> 00:42:27,118
Alice.

775
00:42:27,203 --> 00:42:29,153
I like competition.

776
00:42:29,273 --> 00:42:37,188
