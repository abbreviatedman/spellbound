00:00:00,901 --> 00:00:02,341
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

2
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:03,680
Have you ever
heard of Brakebills?

3
00:00:03,704 --> 00:00:05,544
<i>No.</i> JULIA: <i>It's
like this secret Yale,</i>

4
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:07,317
<i>and you have to be able
to do magic to even get in.</i>

5
00:00:07,341 --> 00:00:10,436
<i>Well, I can do magic.</i>
JULIA: <i>Yeah, so can I.</i>

6
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:11,721
<i>Sorry, I just got your e-mail.</i>

7
00:00:11,745 --> 00:00:12,769
<i>My fifth e-mail.</i>

8
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,224
<i>Just tell me what
you meant by...</i>

9
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:16,945
<i>I mean not herself. I
mean barely talks to me.</i>

10
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,282
<i>She looks like a goddamn
ghost. She's not Julia.</i>

11
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:20,830
I need you to tell them
they were wrong about me.

12
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,117
Tell them to test me again.

13
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:23,399
I'm sorry, but they would know.

14
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:24,934
It's really okay if
this is not your thing.

15
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:26,950
So you were... Top
bitch in New York.

16
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,496
I am willing to teach the
right people everything I know.

17
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:30,940
Who are we trying to contact?
- Charlie.

18
00:00:30,964 --> 00:00:33,524
And who's Charlie?
My brother. He died.

19
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,678
<i>Jesus, we could not have
screwed up that spell worse,</i>

20
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:36,742
<i>and we can't take it back.</i>

21
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:03,290
<i>Now that you're in, it's
time to learn some magic.</i>

22
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:06,532
Just don't get too excited.

23
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,966
Start slow.

24
00:01:08,602 --> 00:01:10,571
Yeah, I don't really do slow.

25
00:01:11,638 --> 00:01:12,799
Hmm.

26
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:24,044
<i>Being a Magician
has always been,</i>

27
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,583
<i>in part,</i>

28
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:29,146
<i>about accruing power.</i>

29
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:32,092
Power over yourself,

30
00:01:32,693 --> 00:01:34,161
the elements.

31
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:36,354
Power over the
future. He's back.

32
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:39,457
The very world that
exists around you.

33
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:40,977
He said he had an announcement.

34
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:43,561
But power, as you all know,

35
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,864
does not come cheaply.

36
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:49,165
<i>There are reasons</i>

37
00:01:49,876 --> 00:01:51,367
<i>we teach this curriculum</i>

38
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,175
<i>precisely the way that we do.</i>

39
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:55,579
<i>Skipping around,</i>

40
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,617
<i>focusing on all
the wrong things,</i>

41
00:01:57,684 --> 00:01:58,982
<i>lack of guidance.</i>

42
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:01,146
<i>These are all
extremely dangerous.</i>

43
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:04,881
<i>There are certain
energies, certain spells,</i>

44
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:09,220
<i>which are far too powerful
for one Magician alone.</i>

45
00:02:10,397 --> 00:02:13,856
If you lose control,
they will turn against you.

46
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,537
They will kill you.
They will consume you.

47
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:19,537
Change you

48
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,904
into something else.

49
00:02:41,428 --> 00:02:44,364
Now that I have your attention,

50
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:47,390
we test to discern
your discipline.

51
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,833
Your area of concentration.

52
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:52,600
It is what you are, and
with the right guidance,

53
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:54,301
you may safely rise

54
00:02:54,374 --> 00:02:56,240
to unknowable heights.

55
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,745
You will find your scheduled
times and invitations

56
00:02:59,813 --> 00:03:01,076
inside your bags.

57
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:13,050
Hey, babe, it's me. Um,
just got your message.

58
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:16,528
I'm so sorry, I got stuck.
Be there as soon as I can.

59
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,293
Love you.

60
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:27,107
Never gets old, does it?

61
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,071
Having a secret.

62
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:30,968
You have magic.

63
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,244
They don't.

64
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,543
Better than money.

65
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,243
Better than sex.

66
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,351
Well, I guess that one depends.

67
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,720
James is cool, really.
He barely notices.

68
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:45,520
We've both been
so busy with school.

69
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:48,728
Look,

70
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,654
we all juggle.

71
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:53,934
You're kicking ass.

72
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,630
Just don't forget to
manage your shit.

73
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:01,166
Don't want boyfriend getting worried,
following you to the safe house door.

74
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,039
Got it covered, okay?

75
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:05,802
I know you do.

76
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,412
Just saying.

77
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:10,914
Yes, these are promising.

78
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13,112
I get a strong sense of blues

79
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:16,216
and pinks.

80
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,053
Is that Alice Quinn?

81
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,385
Alice, please sit,
if there's a seat.

82
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:22,929
Bit of a transition.

83
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,124
I find that I prefer an
office that I can reach

84
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:28,362
without falling down three
flights of steps that I cannot see.

85
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,097
This'll be quick, Alice.

86
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,639
Show Professor
March what you can do.

87
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:38,755
Like I said, I used to do a
lot of coin and card tricks,

88
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:42,045
and I guess sometimes I
would actually use real magic.

89
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,913
Predictions could mean psychic.

90
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:46,818
Vanishing could mean
illusions or physical magic.

91
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:48,480
Hmm. Curious.

92
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:49,784
What? What's curious?

93
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:51,757
Now, try holding these.

94
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:54,584
Think the alphabet in Greek.

95
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:57,124
No.

96
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:59,629
Just lovely, Miss Quinn.

97
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,594
So clean. Very advanced.

98
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:03,967
Physical magic. Hmm.

99
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,403
Definitely.

100
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,382
Just stare at it.

101
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,186
Well, you're not an herbalist.

102
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,492
Undetermined? Can they do that?

103
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:29,196
Yeah, Sunderland
said it happens,

104
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:32,630
so I guess they'll
try again next year.

105
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:36,301
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

106
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,198
<i>Your time has come</i>

107
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:40,402
What is your discipline?

108
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:41,998
Phosphoromancy.

109
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,578
I bend light.

110
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,678
Holy shit!

111
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,147
There are much cooler areas.

112
00:05:50,217 --> 00:05:52,812
Are you kidding me? You
have light bending power.

113
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:54,354
I'm a nothing-mancer.

114
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:57,186
I'm a squat-mancer.

115
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:59,869
Well, if you're undetermined, then
why are you assigned to the Cottage?

116
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:02,385
Literally, they
have extra space.

117
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:07,558
Well, at least they have that allegedly
mind-blowing signature cocktail.

118
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,502
Can't be all bad.

119
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,221
Uh, is there a doorbell
I missed or something?

120
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:19,269
No.

121
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,248
"Let yourselves in," as in
we have to figure out how.

122
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,911
Right.

123
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,654
What a bunch of dicks.

124
00:06:36,363 --> 00:06:37,695
Ow!

125
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,863
This might actually be hard.

126
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:49,435
Hey, what about
your light-bendy thing?

127
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:52,877
Like, yeah, we could use,
like, a magnifying glass.

128
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:56,405
You know, like,
you ever burn ants

129
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:57,610
when you were a kid?

130
00:06:57,684 --> 00:06:59,550
No, that's horrifying.

131
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:29,974
<i>Take all your medicine</i>

132
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,982
Phosphoromancy, bitches.

133
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:38,052
What took you so
long? I'm starving.

134
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,658
Welcome to our gracious abode.

135
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:48,725
<i>You're unable to
tell You know it's over</i>

136
00:07:58,244 --> 00:07:59,610
Shit.

137
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:08,116
You and your first year boys.

138
00:08:08,588 --> 00:08:11,183
What's your obsession
with the flavor of the month?

139
00:08:11,257 --> 00:08:13,283
Aww! Come on.

140
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,829
He's a high-strung super nerd.

141
00:08:16,763 --> 00:08:18,254
We love those.

142
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:25,835
I'm not an experienced
drinker, Quentin.

143
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:27,898
I couldn't tell.

144
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:31,703
You know, it should've worked.

145
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:35,339
That spell we did
to reach my brother.

146
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:38,214
I mean, I went over
it, like, a million times.

147
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,554
"Should've"? You
say that like you

148
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:43,756
wanna do it again.

149
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:46,156
Wait, you don't wanna
try it again, do you?

150
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:48,388
I need to know
the truth, that's all.

151
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:52,093
You know, the spell
we did was, like...

152
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,668
I don't know, it was
like a phone call.

153
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:57,932
We made contact,
but he didn't pick up,

154
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,905
so then The Beast picked up.

155
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:02,602
But that still leaves the
question, "Where's Charlie?"

156
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:06,906
Well, the last time we asked
that question, somebody died.

157
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,476
Never mind. What do you care?

158
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,415
No.

159
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:14,512
I do. I care. I wanna help.

160
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:17,022
I just... I don't...

161
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,753
Hmm...

162
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:22,789
Oh! Yeah.

163
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,225
Um...

164
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:27,131
Have you read,
uh, Teukolsky yet?

165
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:33,664
So apparently, you can find deceased
spirits with a simple locator spell.

166
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:35,364
If they wanna be found.

167
00:09:35,442 --> 00:09:37,308
That's stupid.

168
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:40,977
You're stupid. You
have a stupid face.

169
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,009
Anyone have a match?

170
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,511
It's not working.

171
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,584
Just keep walking.

172
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:54,786
Okay.

173
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,121
Finally.

174
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:00,528
Guess it's Woof Fountain.

175
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,995
Ugh! I never liked this thing.

176
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:06,939
Eliot says it's
enchanted as shit.

177
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:12,472
Supposedly it's bottomless,
so you know the psychics love it.

178
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:14,036
Suicide fountain.

179
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:15,780
You don't think your brother...

180
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,039
No.

181
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,518
He wasn't that kind of guy.

182
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:24,123
He was the kind of guy who always wanted
to fix things for everyone around him.

183
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:26,285
He was really, really good.

184
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,439
You know that spell I did
on the first day of class?

185
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,193
With the Glass Horse?

186
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:34,194
He taught me that.

187
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,946
Come on, let's go.
Nothing's happening.

188
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:13,701
The whole thing
is fucking pointless.

189
00:11:13,773 --> 00:11:15,002
Psychic?

190
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,972
I wanna punch
Sunderland in the throat.

191
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:19,455
You know, as a psychic, you'd
think you'd have seen all this coming.

192
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:21,107
Woman, please. Ahh!

193
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,045
Hold on.

194
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:29,922
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

195
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:31,355
Are we actually
doing this again?

196
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:34,690
Do you know how to close your
mind? 'Cause I will show you right now.

197
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,320
I thought I was.
Eliot gave me a...

198
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:37,830
Seriously, man?

199
00:11:37,897 --> 00:11:39,058
Taylor Swift?

200
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,769
I am not singing
Taylor Swift in my head.

201
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:50,542
Okay, I'll work on it.

202
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:01,717
So, it's got lots of
space. Lots of light.

203
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:03,654
It looks really great.

204
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:09,826
I'm sorry, I guess I thought you were still
considering Yale for the fall with me.

205
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:10,920
What?

206
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:14,664
Okay, can we just
talk about this now?

207
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,861
Where is your head?

208
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:17,836
Why do I feel like
I'm talking to myself?

209
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:21,030
I've just been
busy with class...

210
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,405
Are you seeing someone else?

211
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,239
No! Why would you ask that?

212
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,972
Because you're different.

213
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:28,446
You stand me up. You
don't answer your phone.

214
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,949
I'm just... I'm starting
to feel like the asshole.

215
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,482
You're not.

216
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:36,422
Hey...

217
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,520
I love you.

218
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:41,452
You know that.

219
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:45,799
Look, I know I've been
moody lately, but...

220
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,458
I feel a lot better.

221
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:51,227
James, come on.

222
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:55,433
Hey.

223
00:12:57,744 --> 00:12:59,042
Mmm.

224
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,277
Okay, go on. Someone killed
themselves in the fountain?

225
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,443
Yeah, try 15 students
and one dean.

226
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:08,113
Van Pelt. Fountain's
named after him.

227
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:12,325
It does feel a little bit off
here though, doesn't it?

228
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,828
Brief announcement.

229
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:22,096
The Van Pelt fountain
is temporarily off limits.

230
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:24,269
There's been an incursion.

231
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:29,167
We believe it's a
garden variety haunting.

232
00:13:31,577 --> 00:13:34,479
Redrawing the wards
may have released it

233
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:36,982
much like a mouse caught
in the walls of a building.

234
00:13:38,418 --> 00:13:40,444
No one was seriously hurt.

235
00:13:40,887 --> 00:13:44,085
Both students involved are
recuperating in the infirmary.

236
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:46,419
Regardless,

237
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,758
stay away until we lock it down.

238
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,829
I mean, what if it was Charlie?

239
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,698
I don't know. Maybe.

240
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:58,468
If not, it's a pretty
big coincidence.

241
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:02,518
But if it was Charlie, don't you think
that he would have reached out to you,

242
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:04,101
directly?

243
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,174
Maybe he just did.

244
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:16,352
It's definitely Charlie.

245
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:18,550
Okay.

246
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:24,428
So, why would he try and
drown a bunch of psychics?

247
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:26,728
Uh... Have you met them?

248
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,962
Are you two talking about
what happened at Woof?

249
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:33,665
That was a private
conversation. You know.

250
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,208
Well... Meow!

251
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,145
What was that?

252
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,734
I Just... I don't trust her.

253
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:45,576
Okay, look. I just...

254
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:49,212
I think trying to drown
people seems a little violent.

255
00:14:49,288 --> 00:14:51,120
He may not have even
known what he was doing.

256
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,159
I mean, spirits, they
can get confused.

257
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,162
Okay, then how do we talk to
him without him trying to drown us?

258
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:59,129
I don't know.

259
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,934
But first thing's
first. I found a spell...

260
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,880
Well, five actually, but they
all have their own down side.

261
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,873
Like, we don't know
how Charlie died exactly

262
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:08,317
and the moon is in the
wrong spot right now.

263
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:09,451
Look, I know you
don't trust her,

264
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:11,637
but maybe Margo could...
Or there's a Maori spell.

265
00:15:11,711 --> 00:15:14,203
I'd have to cut off a finger,
but they might be preferable.

266
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:18,818
Quentin, I need your
help. Highest priority.

267
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:21,711
Let's go. Okay.

268
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:25,156
Hey, look, you said it yourself,
you don't have all the facts,

269
00:15:25,224 --> 00:15:26,658
so maybe you don't need a spell.

270
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:31,596
Maybe you need information, and
Margo's discipline is gossip, so...

271
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:33,230
What do you need?

272
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:43,775
We have a real problem.

273
00:15:44,477 --> 00:15:46,105
Is it in the box?

274
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:49,181
Professor Sunderland
came looking for a book

275
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:51,410
from the Physical
Cottage Library,

276
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,077
and it's missing.

277
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:54,396
I diverted her attention, but...

278
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,631
What does that have
to do with the box?

279
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:59,217
Books at Brakebills,
Quentin, are not just books.

280
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:02,456
One goes missing, it's not just a
library fine we're talking about here.

281
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,724
What're we talking about?
We're talking about...

282
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:06,196
We have

283
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,063
occasional parties.

284
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:12,196
During one, someone took a
book, and if we don't find that book

285
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,591
the faculty are going to take
a harder look at our parties,

286
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,438
and that cannot happen, Quentin.

287
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,970
So you gonna tell me
what's in the box, or...

288
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:23,312
Hmm...

289
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:28,149
What the hell is that?

290
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:29,780
The missing book is Volume One.

291
00:16:29,856 --> 00:16:31,051
That...

292
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,453
is Volume Two.

293
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,561
She's going to
lead us to her mate.

294
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:40,732
Oh.

295
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:49,541
Shit.

296
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,974
Uh... Let me try it again.

297
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:54,479
Should be easy.
You're distracted.

298
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:56,847
I know, I just... I
have a lot going on.

299
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,976
No, you don't. You
have this spell. That's it.

300
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,149
So how do you manage it all?

301
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:08,286
Juggling magic and your life?

302
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:11,261
I don't understand the question.

303
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:14,327
I'm not judging you.

304
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,632
I started out like you
and you have a good life.

305
00:17:17,937 --> 00:17:19,269
Boyfriend.

306
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,933
Probably think he
keeps you centered.

307
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,042
Kind of.

308
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:28,013
Or, you know, you're keeping
him around in case you fail here

309
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,946
and need to fall back.

310
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,945
All I know, you have to
mean it for magic to work.

311
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:38,783
Something clicks
when you're all-in,

312
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:40,952
and the real big stuff,

313
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,220
you can't do it

314
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,589
till you're doing
it without a net.

315
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:03,746
I need your help.

316
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,342
That wasn't so hard, was it?

317
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:12,548
Look, I'm just trying to find out
what happened to my brother.

318
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,060
He was a student
here five years ago.

319
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,220
Okay.

320
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,965
He was a physical kid.

321
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,066
His name was Charlie,

322
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,203
and then he died.

323
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:28,468
Know what? I did
hear about that.

324
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:31,911
At Woof, right?

325
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,744
Five, six years back?

326
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,443
It's all making sense now.

327
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:39,610
What is? You.

328
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:41,277
The awkward thing.

329
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:44,549
The anger underneath
the ineffable air of tragedy

330
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,559
you wear like a perfume.

331
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:53,026
Look, can you just tell me what
you know about Charlie? Please?

332
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:56,501
Loathe as I am to admit it, I
don't actually know anything.

333
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:01,971
Although, there was a girl
from Charlie's year who might.

334
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,804
Emily Greenstreet.

335
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:06,744
Who was she?

336
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,007
Just a girl.

337
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,875
When he died,
apparently she took it hard.

338
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:14,387
Dropped out. Gave up
magic. The full muggle.

339
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,251
It was a bit of a scandal.

340
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:17,654
Where is she now?

341
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:18,884
The city.

342
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,449
Fogg set her up with a job

343
00:19:20,526 --> 00:19:23,428
which is how you know
they're hiding something big.

344
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:25,764
I know how to find her.

345
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:27,431
Come on, I'll show you.

346
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,833
I'd actually prefer to go alone.

347
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:32,529
Oh. I know you would, but...

348
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:35,538
What choice do you really have?

349
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,483
Penny.

350
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,020
Welcome.

351
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:51,980
Knew you were coming.

352
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:55,586
I know you've been dreading
this, but you're gonna like it.

353
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:59,259
The coves are for meditation

354
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:01,960
while the enclosed
"Consciousness Areas"

355
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,562
are reserved as a
place to cry, and process.

356
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:09,607
Hmm...

357
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:12,174
We call it, "The Amplifier."

358
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:16,645
So basically, it's like turning
your psychic powers up to 11.

359
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,184
Why would you wanna do that?

360
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,548
Oh, I get it.

361
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:22,019
You're one of those guys
who's trying to shut it out.

362
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,585
You wanna get control of it

363
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:27,487
or it will mess up
your shit big time,

364
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:30,063
and this is the best
place to practice.

365
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:31,222
So...

366
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,532
I do what? Sit.

367
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,229
Relax.

368
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:39,363
Let your mind wander.
It's pretty simple.

369
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:41,839
But you gotta start by
letting go, tough guy.

370
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,536
Less talking.

371
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:45,939
No touching.

372
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:14,899
<i>Help!</i>

373
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:18,276
<i>Please! Help me! Please!</i>

374
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:28,077
I think that's her.

375
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:30,082
Emily?

376
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,287
No, don't run.

377
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:35,021
These shoes are insane.

378
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:40,293
You're from
Brakebills, aren't you?

379
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:43,598
That part of my life is
behind me. I'm sorry.

380
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:45,365
Charlie was my brother.

381
00:21:52,111 --> 00:21:54,808
I just wanna know
what happened to him.

382
00:21:55,748 --> 00:21:57,842
Your brother saved my life.

383
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:01,279
Well, he tried to at least.

384
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,981
So, I fell for this professor.

385
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,623
I know how it sounds,

386
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:09,987
but I was young and...

387
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,398
And he loved me.

388
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:15,834
But then, well, he was married.

389
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:19,830
You know how it is
when you're that age.

390
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:23,171
You get terrible ideas.

391
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:24,471
Hmm...

392
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:27,676
Like what?

393
00:22:28,147 --> 00:22:31,879
I thought I could make
him love me again.

394
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:34,079
Oh! Some kind of love spell?

395
00:22:34,987 --> 00:22:36,011
No.

396
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:38,416
No.

397
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:43,256
I thought if I could
make myself prettier...

398
00:22:44,163 --> 00:22:46,598
Oh, God.

399
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:48,827
No one warned you
how dangerous that was?

400
00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:51,837
I knew, but I'd convinced myself

401
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,373
that it was the only way.

402
00:22:58,244 --> 00:23:02,841
It took me weeks to
figure out how to do it, and

403
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,885
<i>when I did, well, you...</i>

404
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,049
<i>You can imagine how that went.</i>

405
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:19,062
No!

406
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:30,106
I was gonna kill myself.

407
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:34,309
Emily! Wait!

408
00:23:35,681 --> 00:23:37,172
What happened?

409
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:39,375
What did you do?

410
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:46,452
Please.

411
00:23:47,493 --> 00:23:49,155
I just wanna help.

412
00:24:01,707 --> 00:24:03,642
Don't tell anyone, please.

413
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:05,469
Course not.

414
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:08,747
Wait here. I'll be
back. I'm gonna fix this.

415
00:24:12,651 --> 00:24:14,017
He mashed a

416
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:16,720
bunch of stuff together.

417
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,052
<i>It was...</i>

418
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:20,390
<i>It was totally untested.</i>

419
00:24:22,761 --> 00:24:24,320
I really believed

420
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:27,491
he might actually be
able to undo what I did.

421
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:30,596
He was a good Magician.

422
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:34,532
You know, he would
have done anything for me.

423
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:39,104
<i>It was a lot. It was...</i>

424
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:40,971
It was too much.

425
00:24:41,947 --> 00:24:44,815
I begged him to
stop, but he wouldn't,

426
00:24:46,118 --> 00:24:49,282
and that's when it went
totally out of control.

427
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:03,501
It burned right through him...

428
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:10,075
Until he wasn't there
anymore. He was...

429
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:13,836
Do you know what a Niffin is?

430
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:15,871
No.

431
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:17,682
Yes.

432
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,716
It's when too much
runs through you.

433
00:25:20,152 --> 00:25:21,552
Consumes you.

434
00:25:21,954 --> 00:25:23,855
Only the magic is left,

435
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,381
but you're not

436
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,692
you anymore. You're...

437
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,624
Lost.

438
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,828
Where did Charlie go?

439
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:39,666
I don't know. He was just gone.

440
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,442
I never saw him again.

441
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:47,439
Who did all this then?

442
00:25:49,982 --> 00:25:51,644
My professor.

443
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:55,215
Well, I guess you got
his attention after all.

444
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:56,619
I quit school.

445
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:59,180
Gave up magic, and
never looked back.

446
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:02,920
I'm so sorry about Charlie.

447
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:11,101
Hear that? She's
getting excited.

448
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:12,933
I think we're close.

449
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:15,702
Hold this, will you?

450
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:23,179
This bodega is
warded up the ass.

451
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,249
Hedge witches.

452
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:31,950
Amateurs. Magical D-leaguers.

453
00:26:32,024 --> 00:26:34,152
Sad and desperate people.

454
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:37,094
Once one of 'em offered
to blow me for a spell.

455
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,726
It was barely worth it.

456
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:41,130
Let me do the talking.

457
00:27:05,424 --> 00:27:06,653
These are witches?

458
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:08,694
Hmm. Pathetic. No?

459
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,160
Ugh!

460
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:12,994
This kid's trying
Popper number four.

461
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:14,556
It's painful.

462
00:27:20,372 --> 00:27:21,863
Hear you're selling something.

463
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:25,235
Quentin?

464
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,177
Oh, hey.

465
00:27:33,552 --> 00:27:34,696
What the hell are
you doing here?

466
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,830
What the hell are
you doing here?

467
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:37,516
You know these guys?

468
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:38,988
Yeah, they're from Brakebills.

469
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:40,135
We're friends. That's right.

470
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,252
We're from Brakebills.

471
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:44,296
We're classically trained
and we want our book.

472
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:46,589
We don't have your stupid book.

473
00:27:59,545 --> 00:28:00,740
Are they...

474
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,346
Yep.

475
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:04,576
Love wins.

476
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:21,060
Hey! So, that's it?

477
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,944
That's all you're
gonna say to me?

478
00:28:22,968 --> 00:28:24,368
Don't talk to her. Keep going.

479
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:26,462
I don't know what
you're doing here, Jules.

480
00:28:27,005 --> 00:28:28,530
You're better than this.

481
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:30,303
You say that like
I had a choice.

482
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,886
Of course you have a choice.
No, because guess what?

483
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,310
Magic wasn't just handed to me.

484
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:37,444
I told you to please
tell them about me.

485
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:42,651
At first, you know, I thought
maybe they'd actually test me again,

486
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,365
and then I figured
someone would at least come

487
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,756
and try to take my
memory again, and then...

488
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:48,657
Just waiting.

489
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:53,791
It took me weeks to realize you
never even told them about me at all.

490
00:28:55,634 --> 00:28:58,331
Look, Jules, I... You
were my best friend.

491
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,372
Yeah, and so I let it go.

492
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:03,369
What does that
mean, "You let it go?"

493
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:05,086
No, that's crazy, I
can actually do...

494
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,773
The people at Brakebills,
Jules, they can bend light.

495
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:09,474
They can read
minds. They can fly.

496
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:11,039
You can do a party trick.

497
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:16,421
So this is it, huh?

498
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:18,318
The real you.

499
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,226
Do you ever stop to think about
how maybe you treated me?

500
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:22,786
What?

501
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:24,787
I was always there...

502
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:26,593
What? You were so nice
and you were so sweet

503
00:29:26,665 --> 00:29:29,760
to poor little Q who
couldn't get his shit together.

504
00:29:29,835 --> 00:29:31,179
Between you and James
I was Don't put that on me.

505
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:32,880
A two-for-one charity case.
That's your interpretation.

506
00:29:32,904 --> 00:29:34,882
Why are you saying this?
Because that is true, Julia!

507
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:38,502
No, that's not true. I... You
know how I felt about you.

508
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:40,755
I don't know what...
Admit it. Just admit it.

509
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,042
Admit it.

510
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:47,581
So, you're gonna
punish me for that?

511
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:49,715
I don't know what else to say.

512
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,381
You can't blame me.

513
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:55,122
Does James even
know that you're here?

514
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:56,704
You're hanging out
with a bunch of tweakers

515
00:29:56,728 --> 00:29:58,060
who are turning
tricks for spells.

516
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,574
Are you kidding me?
These people wanna...

517
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:02,864
Stop slumming because you're pissed
that you lost, for once in your life.

518
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,633
I'm sorry, but I mean it.

519
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:11,533
You could really get hurt
doing this shit, and for what?

520
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:14,543
Grow up.

521
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,310
Do you love magic?

522
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,050
Is it in your soul?

523
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:30,854
Is it like the secret heart
of what you always were?

524
00:30:34,132 --> 00:30:35,225
Yeah.

525
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:39,103
So you know how I feel.

526
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:13,833
Get in.

527
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:24,248
Penny, how's your head?

528
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,108
How do you think?

529
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:31,882
So, what's wrong with me?

530
00:31:31,957 --> 00:31:33,448
Nothing's wrong.

531
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:36,654
I made the mistake of thinking
you were just psychic, but it...

532
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:38,997
It's more complicated.

533
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:42,195
You are a Traveler.

534
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:44,802
A what now?

535
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:46,466
The rarest

536
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:48,403
and most difficult discipline.

537
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:50,442
Travelers can, with
a little bit of training,

538
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:52,341
go anywhere on Earth, instantly,

539
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:53,902
just as you did.

540
00:31:53,979 --> 00:31:57,507
But you can, with a
great deal of training,

541
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:00,314
actually move between worlds.

542
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,782
Go to other worlds? DEAN: Yes.

543
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:07,257
If the gift does
not kill you first.

544
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:10,386
Great. Just fucking great.

545
00:32:10,529 --> 00:32:12,293
Do you know why I'm here?

546
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,032
To say this.

547
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:17,718
You've been a thin
layer of insouciance over

548
00:32:17,742 --> 00:32:20,137
an open pit of
self-pity your entire life.

549
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,263
This is not a joke.

550
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:26,078
You do not have the luxury to mess
around now that this is out of the bottle.

551
00:32:26,144 --> 00:32:29,478
You will study this. You will
master this. Do you understand?

552
00:32:29,548 --> 00:32:32,347
Ain't you a bucket of
empathy, blind man.

553
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:34,018
Please say yes.

554
00:32:35,187 --> 00:32:37,213
I cannot see you nod.

555
00:32:38,757 --> 00:32:39,850
Fine.

556
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:42,852
Yes.

557
00:32:46,031 --> 00:32:48,500
So, are we just gonna drive
all the way back to Brakebills?

558
00:32:48,567 --> 00:32:50,331
We're already there.

559
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:02,974
Penny.

560
00:33:04,583 --> 00:33:08,315
I've learned a great deal
about Traveling over the years.

561
00:33:08,386 --> 00:33:12,255
We'll start one-on-one tutorials to
help you get a handle on your ability.

562
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:13,383
Yes,

563
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:17,559
before you accidentally
transport yourself inside a volcano.

564
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:31,474
She's right.

565
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,108
We were best friends.

566
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:36,813
Should we help? No.

567
00:33:37,616 --> 00:33:39,608
Let me in, you assholes!

568
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,813
I don't know what happened.
I don't know how it got so bad.

569
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:47,357
You found out who you are
and she found out who she's not.

570
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:49,250
Life.

571
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,861
Tell you what.

572
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:57,493
Let's not talk.

573
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:09,376
How long were you two douchebags
gonna leave me out there?

574
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:12,049
Never mind that.

575
00:34:12,117 --> 00:34:14,211
Now you're with your people.

576
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:16,545
Cheers to that.

577
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,414
Good God.

578
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:24,590
Cheers.

579
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,563
So this is a Niffin box?

580
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,165
This have a lid?
There isn't one.

581
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,960
The Niffin becomes fused with
the wood. It's unable to escape.

582
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,572
How do you activate
it? There's a short chant.

583
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:43,581
You just basically repeat, "I
bind you," in Turkish and English.

584
00:34:43,648 --> 00:34:44,946
That sounds a little easy.

585
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:46,936
Well, that and the month
long incantation it took

586
00:34:46,985 --> 00:34:48,647
to enchant the thing
in the first place.

587
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,315
So, this is the
enchantment research?

588
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,186
We're not gonna use the box.

589
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,122
What?

590
00:34:57,195 --> 00:34:58,959
We're gonna bring Charlie back.

591
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:03,263
Okay, Alice this is the point
where I look at you like you're nuts.

592
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,294
Okay, look.

593
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:09,465
I've been doing some
research on Niffins.

594
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:14,708
Look, they're not even
alive. They're something else.

595
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,372
Look, I can't explain it,

596
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:18,349
but I know that he's out
there. He's somewhere.

597
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:19,860
Is there anything in the
literature that says that

598
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:21,216
going Niffin is reversible?

599
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:22,720
Nothing says that it isn't.

600
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:23,982
Exactly.

601
00:35:24,923 --> 00:35:26,687
So I found this spell.
It can transmutate

602
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:30,388
certain meta-quantum
energies into matter, in theory.

603
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,306
And I combined it with an
advanced transformation ritual...

604
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:33,628
Alice, this is Major Arcana.

605
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:34,942
What? Just because
you couldn't do it?

606
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,299
Nobody could do it. You're
making it up as you go along.

607
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:39,031
Look, I...

608
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,899
You are an amazing
Magician... Don't patronize me.

609
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,418
I'm not patronizing you. I'm telling
you that this is not a good idea.

610
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:45,933
What do you know, hmm?

611
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:49,190
You only learned about magic,
what? Three months ago?

612
00:35:49,214 --> 00:35:52,150
Okay, sure. But even I
can tell that this is crazy.

613
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:53,879
I don't understand
why you can't see that.

614
00:35:53,952 --> 00:35:55,750
Fine. Stay behind.

615
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,616
I'm here, and I'm only here, to
find out what happened to Charlie,

616
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:01,524
and now that I know I
can help him, I'm going to.

617
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,040
Thanks for coming so quick.

618
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:24,815
I was kind of
surprised you called.

619
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:26,711
Thought you disappeared again.

620
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:28,481
You okay?

621
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:32,050
You wanna talk about it?

622
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,219
Please?

623
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,326
Last call, Julia.

624
00:36:37,495 --> 00:36:39,623
I don't know how
to talk about it.

625
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:46,160
I got involved with something.

626
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,107
Made me wanna
give up everything.

627
00:36:51,776 --> 00:36:54,644
Life, school. All of it.

628
00:36:57,716 --> 00:36:59,548
It got under my skin,

629
00:37:00,185 --> 00:37:01,244
and it...

630
00:37:02,253 --> 00:37:03,380
And?

631
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:08,586
Jules, just tell me.

632
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,387
It's Adderall.

633
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:19,331
I started taking it when I
was applying to grad school,

634
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:21,964
and then I was
taking more and more.

635
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,371
I know I've been a bitch,

636
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:29,241
but lately I've been
going to meetings.

637
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:32,946
Wow!

638
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,322
Can I...

639
00:37:43,895 --> 00:37:45,488
I don't know, can I hug you?

640
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,596
I wish you would.

641
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:52,196
It's okay, Jules.

642
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:55,572
I really love you, you know.

643
00:37:56,174 --> 00:37:58,405
I know. I'm amazing.

644
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,770
Okay, so, we're here, and...

645
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:34,070
Arrive at the place of his
transformation. Present yourself.

646
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:38,205
There's a third step.

647
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,175
What's the third step?

648
00:38:41,953 --> 00:38:44,855
I have to call in to him with
something personal between us,

649
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:47,486
um,

650
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:51,090
so Charlie used to sing
to me my favorite song

651
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:54,257
when I was feeling bad
which is kind of all the time.

652
00:39:00,271 --> 00:39:03,503
<i>Won't you come see about me</i>

653
00:39:03,575 --> 00:39:05,203
Is that <i>The Breakfast Club?</i>

654
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,709
<i>I'll be alone dancing</i>

655
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,578
<i>You know it, baby</i>

656
00:39:11,149 --> 00:39:14,551
<i>Tell me your troubles and doubts</i>

657
00:39:15,253 --> 00:39:18,815
<i>Giving me everything
inside and out</i>

658
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:24,624
<i>Don't you forget about me</i>

659
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:28,295
<i>Don't, don't, don't, don't</i>

660
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,392
Alice, look.

661
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:39,176
Charlie.

662
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:41,445
Charlie?

663
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,359
Charlie, is that you? Alice.

664
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:57,259
Oh, my God, Charlie,
I can't believe it's you.

665
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:01,324
I missed you so much. I
don't even know what to say.

666
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:05,429
Charlie, what are you doing?

667
00:40:06,704 --> 00:40:09,833
Charlie, you're hurting
me. Charlie, that hurts.

668
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:15,009
You're just confused,
Charlie, it's me.

669
00:40:17,682 --> 00:40:20,675
Charlie, why are you doing this?

670
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:22,248
Why?

671
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,998
Alice, I don't think... I
don't think that we should...

672
00:40:24,022 --> 00:40:25,733
I know you're in there,
Charlie. I know it's you.

673
00:40:25,757 --> 00:40:26,816
Alice!

674
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:29,122
Ha!

675
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:31,753
Charlie, stop! I can help you.

676
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,302
Alice, stop!

677
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:55,296
Alice, he's gonna kill
us. It's not gonna work.

678
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,031
You have to stop.
Shut up, I can do this.

679
00:40:57,055 --> 00:40:58,580
Alice, it's not Charlie.

680
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:15,735
You are bound and held fast.

681
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:18,936
No!

682
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,308
I bind you!

683
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:22,944
No! I bind you!

684
00:41:33,291 --> 00:41:35,760
You brought the box.

685
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:38,822
Yeah.

686
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,096
Alice, he was gonna kill you.

687
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,500
Why did you think
you had to save me?

688
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:48,332
Fuck you, Quentin.

689
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:51,906
You had no idea
what I was doing.

690
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:55,706
I was so close,
and now he's gone.

691
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:21,632
Where you going, kitty cat?

692
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:23,641
I'm done here. For good.

693
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:25,768
You should be happy.
Less competition.

694
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:27,004
Alice.

695
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,314
I like competition.
